Herein, we report the fabrication of PdAg nanoshells with tunable thickness in the range of 5–13 nm and a unique concave cubic morphology, as well as the exploration of their applications for ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) in alkaline media. The success of current work relies on the conformal deposition of PdAg on concave Au nanocubes, where the controlled reaction kinetics and proper chosen capping agent are both crucial for the growth mode. When loaded on carbon black and working as electrocatalysts, they exhibited superb electrochemical activity (e.g               .               , 600.21 mA mg               −1               in mass activity and 19.57 A m               −2               in specific activity), together with improved EOR kinetics and long-term durability, as compared to Au@Pd nanoparticles and commercial Pd/C. The current work offers a feasible strategy to produce PdAg bimetallic nanocrystals with concave surface and validates their promising application as fuel cell catalysts, which could be extended to morphology engineering of other noble-metal nanocrystals for a broad range of applications.","2021-11-01","2026-01-08 11:28:41","2026-01-08 11:28:41","2026-01-08 11:28:41","761236","","","8","","Front.

Platinum (Pt) and Pt-based alloys are regarded as the most effective catalysts for both oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and ethanol oxidation reaction. To further enhance the catalytic performance of the catalyst, it is necessary to improve the mass activity and utilization efficiency of Pt. In this work, we report a strategy for fabricating ordered mesostructured platinum-palladium alloy nanotubes (MPPNs) with high hierarchical porosity (68%) and abundant exposed active edge sites. MPPNs exhibit excellent catalytic activity and stability for ORR, with a mass activity approximately 7.4 times higher than that of the commercial Pt/C catalyst. After 20 k cycles of accelerated durability test for ORR, MPPNs demonstrate impressive retention of their original mass activity, maintaining a value of 93.9%. Furthermore, they display superior catalytic activity and stability for ethanol oxidation reactions, with a mass activity about 2.4 times higher than that of commercial Pt/C. After the 2,000 scan cycles, the mass activity remains at 84.5% of initial performance.

A hierarchically porous graphene architecture, grown on carbon cloth, is used to fabricate the confined catalyst bed in order to enhance the mass‐diffusion limitation in interface‐confined reactions.

Their physiochemical characterization (X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)) results show alloyed PdIrNi nanoparticles that are well dispersed (<3 nm) and exist in metallic state that is air-stable apart from Ni and, slightly, Pd. Their electrocatalytic activity towards EOR was evaluated by means of cyclic voltammetry (CV) and chronoamperometry (CA). Even though the physiochemical characterization of PdIrNi/C and Pd4Ir2Ni1/C is promising, their EOR performance has proven them less active than their Pd/C counterpart. Although the oxidation current peak of Pd/C is 1.8 A/mgPd, it is only 0.48 A/mgPd for Pd4Ir2Ni1/C and 0.52 A/mgPd for PdIrNi/C. These results were obtained three times and are reproducible, but since they do not add up with the sound PdIrNi microstructure, more advanced and in situ EOR studies are necessary to better understand the poor EOR performance.","2021-10-28","2026-01-08 11:26:59","2026-01-08 11:26:59","2026-01-08 11:26:59","1327","","11","12","","Micromachines","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\Administrator\Zotero\storage\8LPRRAUM\Elsheikh 等 - 2021 - Synthesis of Carbon-Supported PdIrNi Catalysts and Their Performance towards Ethanol Electrooxidatio.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The optimal NiO NTs exhibit a large electrochemically active surface area, a fast catalytic kinetics, and a small charge transfer resistance, which induce an outstanding electrocatalytic activity for the methanol oxidation reaction (MOR). Compared with conventional NiO nanoparticles, NiO NTs achieve a 11.5-fold increase in mass activity at 1.5 V for the MOR due to nanotubal morphology and abundant non-vacancy defects on the NiO NT surface. Moreover, NiO NTs have a higher electrocatalytic activity for the intermediates of the MOR (such as formaldehyde and formate) than conventional NiO nanoparticles, which also contribute to MOR activity enhancement.

This paper reports a conformal, layer‐by‐layer deposition of Pt atoms on defective Rh nanowires for the faithful replication of surface defects (i.e., grain boundaries) on the Rh nanowires.

The nanocatalysts have been synthesized by the polyol method. The morphology and chemical composition of the synthesized Pd-CeO               2-NR               /C and Pd/C have been determined in a Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FESEM) with an energy dispersive X-Ray detector. The results show a chemical composition close to the nominally expected. Meanwhile, the XRD analysis demonstrates the crystalline nature of the nanocatalysts with crystallite size of Pd-CeO               2-NR               /C and Pd/C of 11.8 and 7.9 nm, respectively.

It has been determined that after accelerated degradation test (ADT, 3000 cycles between 0.6 and 1.0 V/RHE), the ECSA loss of Pd-CeO               2-NR               /C is of around 3 %, clearly smaller compared to 80 % in the case of Pd/C, which suggests a synergic effect between CeO               2-NR               and Pd that stabilizes the metallic nanoparticles. Evaluation by RRDE shows that Pd-CeO               2-NR               /C has a catalytic activity for the ORR similar to Pd/C in terms of onset potential of the ORR (0.98 and 0.94 V/RHE before ADT, respectively; 0.91 and 0.92 V/RHE after ADT, respectively). Nevertheless, Pd-CeO               2-NR               /C delivers higher mass and specific activities than Pd/C, with both nanocatalysts producing about the same amount of H               2               O               2               (around 3 - 4.5 %).

After ADT, the mass current density increased by 1.6 and 1.4 times at Pd-CeO               2-NR               /C and Pd/C, respectively. The results show that Pd-CeO               2-NR               /C is a highly electrochemically stable bifunctional nanocatalysts with high catalytic activity for the ORR and the EOR in alkaline media, which make it a promising candidate for A-DEFCs applications.","2019-09-01","2026-01-08 11:24:09","2026-01-08 11:24:09","2026-01-08 11:24:09","1644-1644","","36","MA2019-02","","Meet.

Moreover, hysteresis diffusion effect induced by lattice distortion in the HEA nanodendrites contributes to their superb ethanol oxidation stability. In situ infrared absorption spectroscopy reveals that the three HEA nanodendrites mainly follow C1 pathway with C−C bond breaking to form CO followed by CO oxidation especially at a wide range of high potentials. Theoretical calculations reveal that among these HEAs, PtIrRhCoFeNiCu possesses the lowest energy barrier for C−C bond scission due to synergy among Pt/Ir/Rh and water dissociation due to synergy among Co/Fe/Ni/Cu. This work provides insights to design unique HEA nanostructures with extraordinary catalytic performances and selectivity compared to conventional nanoparticles.","2025-03-03","2026-01-08 11:23:56","2026-01-08 11:23:56","2026-01-08 11:23:56","e202420752","","10","137","","Angewandte Chemie","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\Administrator\Zotero\storage\XTFFGU5K\Wang 等 - 2025 - Unconventional Interconnected High‐Entropy Alloy Nanodendrites for Remarkably Efficient C−C Bond Cle.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite some encouraging achievements, their activity and selectivity remain unsatisfactory. In this work, it is reported that 2D PtRhPb mesoporous nanosheets (MNSs) with anisotropic structure and surface‐clean metal site perform perfectly for complete EOR electrocatalysis in both three‐electrode and two‐electrode systems. Different to the traditional routes, a selective etching strategy is developed to produce surface‐clean mesopores while retaining parent anisotropy quasi‐single‐crystalline structure without the mesopore‐forming surfactants. This method also allows the general synthesis of surface‐clean mesoporous metals with other compositions and structures. When being performed for alkaline EOR electrocatalysis, the best PtRhPb MNSs deliver remarkably high activity (7.8 A mg               −1               ) and superior C1 product selectivity (70% of Faradaic efficiency), both of which are much better than reported electrocatalysts.

However, the main challenges of EOR are insufficient catalytic activity, high overpotential, and slow kinetics. Active sites on the electrocatalysts surface are occupied by alkali metal ion hydrate clusters by noncovalent interactions, which is considered to be one of the major causes of these challenges.

It is found that OH radicals can be produced from the OH               ads               species adsorbed on the surfaces of Pd atoms led by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect of spiky Au@AuPd NPs under the irradiation of NIR light.

Accordingly, the electrocatalytic performance of spiky Au@AuPd NPs toward EOR under NIR light is greatly improved.

Although 2D metals serve as interesting platforms, further manipulating them in solution with highly penetrated mesopores and ideal crystallinity remains a huge challenge. Here, an easy yet powerful synthesis strategy for manipulating the mesoporous structure and crystallinity of 2D metals in a controlled manner with cetyltrimethylammonium chloride as the mesopore‐forming surfactant and extra iodine‐ion as the structure/facet‐selective agent is reported. This strategy allows for preparing an unprecedented type of 2D quasi‐single‐crystalline mesoporous nanoplates (SMPs) with highly curved morphology and controlled metal composition. The products, for example, PdCu SMPs, feature abundant undercoordinated sites, optimized electronic structures, excellent electron/mass transfers, and confined mesopore environments.

In this study, a one‐pot solution‐phase method to synthesize Pd nanowire networks (NNWs) with very high surface‐to‐volume ratio having numerous twin and grain boundaries is developed. Using the same method, the Pd lattice is further engineered by introducing Ag and Cu atoms to produce AgPd, and CuPd alloy structure which significantly shifts the Pd d‐band center upward and downward, respectively due to strain and ligand effects. Theoretical analysis employing density functional theory (DFT) demonstrates that such modification of the d‐band center significantly influences the adsorption energies of reactants on the catalytic surface. Owing to their notably high surface‐to‐volume ratio and the presence of multiple twin and grain boundaries, Pd NNWs demonstrate significantly enhanced electrocatalytic activity toward EOR, ≈7.2 times greater than that of commercial Pd/C.

The as-prepared Ir-PbO/C catalysts with a mean metallic nanoparticle size of 2.6 ± 0.5 nm can greatly improve the activity, stability, and C1 pathway selectivity of EOR. Specifically, it exhibits superior mass activity of 1150 mA/mgIr in 1 M NaOH solution containing 1 M C2H5OH. Chronoamperometry tests show that the stability of Ir-PbO/C is also significantly improved compared with Ir/C.

In this study, the core–shell Au@Pd pentatwinned decahedral nanoparticles has been synthesized with controlled Pd shell thicknesses, varying in the average number of Pd monolayers over the Au core. This core‐shell configuration promotes the epitaxial growth of Pd atoms with varying degrees of tensile strain. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that increasing tensile strain shifts the d‐band center closer to the Fermi level. Notably, when the Pd shell is three monolayers, the upward shift of the d‐band center is maximum, and this further amplified by the ligand effect from the underlying Au core. The synergistic influence of five twin boundaries, tensile strain, and ligand interactions collectively tunes the d‐band center, resulting in the Au@Pd‐3 catalyst achieving an exceptional mass activity of 25.67 A mg               Pd               −1               and a specific activity of 21.30 mA cm               −2               , representing enhancements of 38.31‐fold and 11.39‐fold, respectively, over commercial Pd/C.

In this work, a series of mesoporous RhPt electrocatalysts (RhPt‐MPS) with different compositions are designed and synthesized toward the ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR). The mesoporous structure of RhPt‐MPS exposes abundant surface sites and channels for mass transfer of ethanol, and thus boosts the catalytic EOR performance. It has been confirmed that Rh not only reduces the oxidation potential of EOR, but also effectively facilitates the breakage of C─C bond. Stemming from structural and compositional advantages of the RhPt               0.6               ‐MPS electrocatalyst, it exhibits the highest activity (2846.0 mA mg               –1               ) for the EOR when compared with other RhPt‐MPS, Rh‐MPS, and Pt‐MPS electrocatalysts.

Herein, to address the deficiencies associated with the commonly used dealloying methods, for example, electrochemical and sulfuric acid/nitric acid treatment, we report an acetic acid‐assisted mild strategy to dealloy Cu atoms from the outer surface layers of CuPd alloy nanoparticles to achieve high‐efficiency electrocatalysis for oxygen reduction and ethanol oxidation in an alkaline electrolyte. The leaching of Cu atoms by acetic acid exerts an additional compressive strain effect on the surface layers and exposes more active Pd atoms, which is beneficial for boosting the catalytic performance of a dealloyed catalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR). In particular, for ORR, the CuPd nanoparticles with a Pd/Cu molar ratio of 2:1 after acetic dealloying show a half‐wave potential of 0.912 V (vs. RHE) and a mass activity of 0.213 A mg               Pd               −1               at 0.9 V, respectively, while for EOR, the same dealloyed sample has a mass activity and a specific activity of 8.4 A mg               −1               and 8.23 mA cm               −2               , respectively, much better than their dealloyed counterparts at other temperatures and commercial Pd/C as well as a Pt/C catalyst.","2023-07","2026-01-06 16:54:15","2026-01-11 16:20:05","2026-01-06 16:54:15","e324","","7","5","","Carbon Energy","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\Administrator\Zotero\storage\XTY7UVUH\Liu 等 - 2023 - Acetic acid‐assisted mild dealloying of fine CuPd nanoalloys achieving compressive strain toward hig.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

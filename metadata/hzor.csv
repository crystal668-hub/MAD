In this work, we design a simple one‐pot chemical method to synthesize a new type of copper clusters. The structures and composition of the clusters are characterized by using various techniques. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry characterizations clearly show that the product is mainly composed of a seven‐copper‐atom core and three thiolate ligands with the formula of Cu               7               (C               7               H               5               O               2               S)               3               −               , together with four‐ and six‐copper‐atom clusters. On the other hand, direct hydrazine fuel cells have attracted extensive research interests and more and more efforts have been devoted into the development of novel catalysts for the electrochemical oxidation and detection of hydrazine. Here, we investigate the electrocatalytic performance of the copper clusters towards the oxidation and detection of hydrazine. Electrochemical studies display that the synthesized cluster compounds supported on activated carbon show an onset potential of −0.42 V and a current density of 20 mA cm               −2               at the potential of 0.36 V for the oxidation of hydrazine. Meanwhile, the copper clusters show a limit of detection of 1.04 μ               m               and a sensitivity of 0.408 mA cm               −2                m               m               −1               in the detection of hydrazine. These studies clearly demonstrate that the as‐synthesized copper clusters exhibit excellent electrocatalytic performance for the oxidation and detection of hydrazine. Notably, the catalytic performance is superior to the previously reported Cu‐based or Ni‐based, and even noble‐metal‐based, catalysts.","2016-08","2026-01-07 12:59:37","2026-01-07 12:59:37","2026-01-07 12:59:37","1266-1272","","8","3","","ChemElectroChem","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\Administrator\Zotero\storage\5FLL8JMU\Gao 等 - 2016 - Copper Nanoclusters on Carbon Supports for the Electrochemical Oxidation and Detection of Hydrazine.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Traditional strategies for constructing CoPx/Co heterostructures took less consideration on the exposure of the active sites. In this study, 3D nanoflower-like nano CoPx/Co heterostructures with highly exposed active sites were obtained on a nickel foam (NF) through a dual-component phosphating strategy, i.e., regulating the relative content of Co and Co(OH)2 with cathodic current density and utilizing the differences in their phosphating behaviors.

However, toxicity and volatility of this compound might prevent the wide spread of direct hydrazine hydrate fuel cells. In this context, hydrazine derivatives such as N, N-diaminourea (DAU) and methyl carbazate would be a possible remedy for this problem. These hydrazine derivatives are solid, and evaporation of them would be suppressed. Unfortunately, conventional metal catalysts such as Ni, Pt, and Co hardly oxidize these hydrazine derivatives.             In this work, we report a metallocomplex-based electrocatalyst for the oxidation of hydrazine derivatives. These catalysts completely differ from conventional metal-based electrocatalysts in that single atoms form active sites, and hence new oxidation activity would be expected.             We examined metalloporphyrin-based electrocatalysts for the oxidation of DAU. These complexes can oxidize DAU to give considerable current, while conventional Pt catalysts cannot oxidize DAU. The catalytic activities depend on the kinds of central metals; Co-, Rh-, Fe-, Ru-porphyrins give high current. The catalytic activity increased with the change in the ligand from porphyrins to phthalocyanines. Especially, Fe phthalocyanine gave high catalytic activity for the oxidation of DAU; the current exceeded 150 mA/cm2 at 0.6 V vs. a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE).             There are two possible pathways of the electro-oxidation of DAU by Fe-PC: (1) DAU is directly oxidized by the electrode (direct pathway) and (2) DAU undergoes hydrolysis to produce hydrazine, and the generated hydrazine is oxidized by the electrode (indirect pathway). HPLC analysis and the dependence of the activity on the concentrations of DAU and hydrazine revealed that the oxidation of DAU proceeds mainly via a direct oxidation pathway.             Finally, we made a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) using Fe-PC as an anode catalyst, and examined the performance of the MEA (cathode catalyst is Pt/C and anion-exchange membrane is A201 (Tokuyama)). The cell gave a considerable power; open circuit potential is close to 0.6 V, and the short-circuit current is 180 mA/cm2 at 80 °C. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a polymer electrolyte fuel cell that uses Fe-PC as an anode catalyst, while the electro-oxidation activity of Fe-PC has been studied for several decades.             The authors are grateful to Tokuyama Corporation for donating an ionomer (AS-4) and A201 membrane.","2016-09-01","2026-01-07 13:00:19","2026-01-07 13:00:19","2026-01-07 13:00:19","2693-2693","","38","MA2016-02","","Meet.

The electrochemical results demonstrate the exceptional dual‐functional activity of the optimized NiCoPt‐10 alloy, effectively catalyzing both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR). Specifically, the NiCoPt‐10 alloy presents a low overpotential of 90 mV at 10 mA·cm               −2               for HER and a small working potential of 0.068 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) at 10 mA·cm               −2               for HzOR.

Our strategy involves electrophoretic deposition (EPD) of graphene oxide (GO) on Au substrate to obtain a uniform layer EPD‐GO, followed by electrochemical reduction of GO to yield high quality graphene ERGO and electrodeposition of monodispersed AuNPs on ERGO (AuNPs/ERGO/Au).

The sensor exhibited an improved catalytic activity with a peak potential of +87 mV (vs. Ag/AgCl) for hydrazine oxidation. The high performance of this hybrid electrode is due to the presence of a synergistic effect between AuNPs and ERGO at their interface.

Herein, we elucidate the dual‐pathway nature of HzOR on cobalt‐based catalysts, involving direct electrooxidation on metallic Co and mediated oxidation via the redox cycle between metallic Co and cobalt hydroxide species. This mechanistic insight moves beyond the traditional focus on solely enhancing the intrinsic activity in the direct pathway. Instead, it highlights the chemical redox reaction between hydrazine and Co(II) as a central process that not only regenerates metallic Co sites for direct pathway but also drives the mediated oxidation route. Guided by this understanding, we designed a defect‐rich cobalt catalyst through a one‐step electrodeposition method, enabling fast chemical reduction of oxidized Co species by hydrazine. As a result, the catalyst delivers superior HzOR performance, reaching a current density of 100 mA cm               −2               at only −79 mV versus reversible hydrogen electrode, along with outstanding long‐term stability.

Owing to their diverse chemical structure, improved mass- and charge-transfer kinetics, and fascinating 2D layered structure, LDHs have emerged to be promising electrocatalysts for water electrolysis. Yet, some limitations, including their low stability and poor conductivity, remain as major obstacles towards the application of LDHs in the field of electrocatalysis. As a result, various LDH-derived nanomaterials, like selenides, sulphides, phosphides,               etc.               , have been employed as effective electrocatalysts towards water splitting. Here in this study, a solvothermal reaction strategy was employed to derive a selenide from NiFe-LDH and the successful selenization resulted in the formation of Fe-doped Ni               3               Se               4               (Fe@Ni               3               Se               4               ) with a 2D microporous structure.

The presence of Fe with a lower valency provided an added advantage over the redox activity and stable structural outcomes, which was confirmed from operando impedance analysis and various other characterizations.

However, the widespread application of H               2               fuel has been limited by the difficulty of storage. In this work, spontaneous electrochemical hydrogen production is demonstrated using hydrazine (N               2               H               4               ) as a liquid hydrogen storage medium and enabled by a highly active Co catalyst for hydrazine electrooxidation reaction (HzOR). The HzOR electrocatalyst is developed by a self‐limited growth of Co nanoparticles from a Co‐based zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF), exhibiting abundant defective surface atoms as active sites for HzOR. Notably, these self‐limited Co nanoparticles exhibit remarkable HzOR activity with a negative working potential of −0.1 V (at 10 mA cm               −2               ) in 0.1                m               N               2               H               4               /1                m               KOH electrolyte.

Revealing noble metal active sites and keeping them in a form of stable and high loading are crucial to improving the catalytic performance and understanding the reaction mechanism. Herein, a feasible preparation method was used to synthesize a Rh-based ultrathin NiFe layered double hydroxide (Rh/NiFe). The detailed study proved that the existence form of Rh atoms is atomically dispersed. Moreover, extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) with theoretical calculation of X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and density functional theory (DFT) were used to identify at the atomic level the precise location and coordination environment of the introduced Rh atoms. It was found that Rh atoms are doped in the LDH layer in a coplanar position with Ni and Fe atoms. With a 5.4 wt% loading amount of Rh, the modified catalyst of Rh/NiFe-5.4 requires 80 mV less than unmodified ultrathin NiFe layered double hydroxide (NiFe) for hydrazine electrooxidation.

Traditional electrolytic water splitting confronts high anode voltage with oxygen generation and the amount of hydrogen produced at cathode depends entirely on the quantity of electric charge input. Herein, excess hydrogen output can be achieved by constructing a spontaneous hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) coupled hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) system. For the hydrazine oxidation‐assisted electrolyzer in this work, both the external input electrons and the electrons produced by spontaneous chemical redox reaction can reduce water, producing more hydrogen than traditional electrolytic water splitting system. The ultrafast kinetics of bifunctional P‐doped Co‐based catalysts plays a key role in the spontaneous feature of HzOR/HER redox reaction and low working voltage of hydrazine oxidation‐assisted electrolyzer (12 mV@100 mA cm               −2               ). Theoretical calculation results and ex situ/in situ spectra demonstrate that doped P could optimize electronic structure, regulate adsorption energy of intermediates, and thus endows catalysts with ultrafast kinetics. This work provides a new pathway for the development of spontaneous oxidation‐assisted hydrogen production, to achieve excess hydrogen output via concurrent electrochemical and chemical redox reactions.","2025-01","2026-01-07 13:11:17","2026-01-07 13:11:17","2026-01-07 13:11:17","2406288","","1","21","","Small","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\Administrator\Zotero\storage\ZILPCFKW\Yao 等 - 2025 - Achieving Excess Hydrogen Output via Concurrent Electrochemical and Chemical Redox Reactions on P‐Do.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, their HER activities are restrained by the poor population of HER activated edge centers, the large area exposed HER inert basal planes, and low conductivity. Fixing these problems on one system is an effective strategy, but it remains a challenge due to the harsh synthetic conditions. Herein, cobalt carbonate hydroxide (CoCH) nanosheets were used as the substrate for preparing a three-dimensional self-supported cross-linked (3DSC) Co-MoS               2               nanostructured HER catalyst, which possesses abundant active centers and fast electronic transfer ability.

Here, we innovatively report high‐entropy alloy nanoflower array (HEANFA) electrodes with optimizable reaction pathways for hydrazine oxidation‐assisted hydrogen production at industrial‐grade current densities. Atomic‐resolution structural analyses confirm the single‐phase solid‐solution structure of HEANFA. The HEANFA electrodes exhibit the top‐level electrocatalytic performance for both the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR). Furthermore, the hydrazine oxidation‐assisted splitting (OHzS) system assembled with HEANFA as both anode and cathode exhibits a record‐breaking performance for hydrogen production. It achieves ultralow working voltages of 0.003, 0.081, 0.260, 0.376, and 0.646 V for current densities of 10, 100, 500, 1 000, and 2 000 mA cm               −2               , respectively, and remarkable stability for 300 h, significantly outperforming those of previously reported OHzS systems and other chemicals‐assisted hydrogen production systems. Theoretical calculations reveal that extraordinary performance of HEANFA for OHzS is attributed to its abundant high‐activity sites and optimizable reaction pathways in HER and HzOR. In particular, HEANFA enables intelligent migration of key intermediates during HzOR, thereby optimizing the reaction pathways and creating high‐activity sites, ultimately endowing the extraordinary performance for OHzS.","2025-02","2026-01-07 13:11:38","2026-01-07 13:11:38","2026-01-07 13:11:38","2416200","","7","37","","Advanced Materials","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\Administrator\Zotero\storage\HFIP53TT\Li 等 - 2025 - High‐Entropy Alloy Nanoflower Array Electrodes with Optimizable Reaction Pathways for Low‐Voltage Hy.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although several operando techniques have been used to monitor the electrocatalytic process, real‐time imaging techniques for observing the surface change on electrode materials are still a challenge and limited to a few stable catalytic systems. Herein, the quasi‐in situ electrochemical transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was carried out to track the morphological and local structure evolution during the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on manganese dioxide (MnO               2               ) for the first time. The α‐MnO               2               nanorods exhibit comparable ORR electrocatalytic activity (half‐wave potential,               E               1/2               : 0.83 vs. 0.85 V vs. RHE; diffusion‐limiting current density,               J               d               : −5.46 vs. −5.52 mA cm               −2               ) and better methanol tolerance than Pt/C. An electrochemical TEM chip assembled with a three‐electrode system was used to perform the electrochemical experiments similar to typical testing procedures. The ex situ and quasi‐in situ TEM images consistently showed that MnO               2               nanorods had undergone surface roughening, and lattice expansion with 0.97% and 1.97% in the               a               and               c               ‐axis, respectively as ORR proceeded.

However, there’re still many technical difficulties and challenges hindering their widespread commercial application, among which the most important ones are high loading (high cost) of Pt [1] and its dissolution [2] during fuel cell operation on the cathode side of fuel cell.             The approach of synthesizing electrocatalysts with a monolayer of Pt provides an effective way of reducing Pt contents while maintaining or even improving their electrochemical activities for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) [3]. However, in addition to have beneficial catalytical influence on Pt shell, the material from which the cores are made, must be stabile in highly oxidative environment of the fuel cell cathode.                            Pt monolayer (Pt               ML               ) catalyst deposited on Pd and Pd-based alloys cores showed higher ORR activity and stability compared to a pure Pt catalyst [2, 4]. Due to the incomplete Pt shell, Pd (a noble metal) shows some instability under the prolonged highly oxidizing conditions that can occur during fuel cell operation. Since Ir is one of the most stable transition metals, some research has been conducted on Pt               ML               catalysts deposited on Ir and Ir-M (M=Fe, Co, Ni, Cu) alloy nanoparticle substrates [5, 6].                                         In this work, low-Pt content catalysts consist of a Pt               ML               on carbon-supported IrPd (IrPd/C) and IrPd-shell Ni-core (IrPd/Ni/C) nanoparticles were examined for ORR activity and stability. IrPd/C nanoparticles, with molar ratio of Ir:Pd=1:4, were prepared using PdCl               2               and (NH               4               )               2               IrCl               6               as metal precursors, citric acid as a complexing agent, and NaBH               4               as a reducing agent. The IrPd/Ni/C nanoparticles were synthesized by first preparing Ni nanoparticles supported on carbon (Ni/C) which were subsequently immersed in solution containing Pd and Ir ions (Ir:Pd=1:4) to form PdIr shell by partially galvanically displacing Ni. After that, IrPd/C and IrPd/Ni/C nanoparticles were filtered and dried in vacuum oven. At the end, they were annealed in pure H               2               atmosphere at 550°C for 2 hours. The Pt               ML               IrPd/C and Pt               ML               IrPd/Ni/C catalysts were prepared by depositing a Pt monolayer onto these particles by displacing a Cu monolayer formed at underpotentials in 0.05 M CuSO               4               and 0.1M H               2               SO               4               solution.                                         The average diameter of IrPd/C nanoparticles is ~ 4 nm (Fig. 1) while for the IrPd/Ni/C nanoparticles is ~ 10 nm (not shown). Polarization curves showed that both the catalysts of interests in this work have better ORR activities than Pt               ML               catalysts deposited on commercial Pd/C (30wt% NE-H) (Pt               ML               Pd/C). The half-wave potentials and initial Pt mass activities of Pt               ML               IrPd/C (882 mV, 1.71 A/mg               Pt               ) and Pt               ML               IrPd/Ni/C catalysts (877 mV, 1.61 A/mg               Pt               ) are much high than those for Pt               ML               Pd/C (854 mV, 0.555 A/mg               Pt               ) (Fig. 2). Moreover, after 5,000 cycles of accelerated durability test, the Pt               ML               IrPd/C still has a relatively high Pt mass activity of 1.16 A/mg               Pt,               while that of Pt               ML               IrPd/Ni/C drops to 0.775 A/mg               Pt               but still exceeds the DOE 2020 technical targets for electrocatalysts for transportation applications [7]. More detailed discussion on the ORR activity and stability of these catalysts will be presented at the meeting.

Each step in the PLS sequence is assessed in detail in terms of related structural properties of resulting carbon catalysts, and their effects on ORR activities are elaborated to confirm the validity of the current synthesis protocol. It is found that as-prepared carbon catalyst exhibits outstanding high catalytic activity in both alkaline and acidic conditions. The carbon catalyst prepared at pyrolysis temperature of 900               o               C (FePPyC-900) shows remarkably high ORR activity with onset potential of 0.96 V (vs. RHE), which is similar to that of Pt/C, whereas the half-wave potential (E               1/2               ) of FePPyC-900 is 0.877 V, which is more positive than that of Pt/C at the same catalyst loading amount in alkaline condition. Furthermore, the FePPyC-900 catalyst also illustrates exceptionally high activity in acidic condition with onset and half-wave potentials, which are almost comparable to those of the state-of-the-art Pt/C catalyst, which is rarely observed for non-Pt based carbon catalyst. In addition, the FePPyC-900 catalyst displays much better stability and methanol tolerance than the Pt/C and exhibits four electron transfer pathway in both alkaline and acidic conditions. Such extraordinary high ORR activity and stability the FePPyC samples can be attributed to the implementation of extra stabilization step in addition to conventional sample preparation steps of pyrolysis and subsequent leaching in current PLS synthesis protocol as well as to the use of highly conducting PPy as a single precursor of carbon and nitrogen in the presence of Fe.","2016-09-01","2026-01-06 11:10:14","2026-01-08 04:55:11","2026-01-06 11:10:14","2670-2670","","38","MA2016-02","","Meet.

Rational modulation of the coordination environment in the second coordination shell of SACs offers an opportunity to improve the intrinsic ORR activity, yet a challenge.

In this study, we have synthesized a series of model electrocatalysts with well‐defined CoN               4               centers and nonplanar symmetric coordination structures. These catalysts were prepared by a sequential process involving the chelation of cobalt salts and 1,10‐phenanthroline‐based ligands with various substituent groups (phen(X), where X=OH, CH               3               , H, Br, Cl) onto covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs).

In particular, the difference in half‐wave potential for ORR relative to commercial Pt/C catalyst is only 50 mV negative in acidic medium, whereas it is 50 mV more positive in alkaline medium. Interestingly, it is found that although the use of iron is necessary for the preparation of highly active nitrogen‐doped ORR carbon catalysts, its presence is not necessary for N‐OMC to be active in the ORR in either alkaline or acidic media.

The combined results of experimental and theoretical investigations indicate that the alloying of Co enables a favorable electronic structure for the formation of the *OH intermediate, while the periodically trimodal‐porous structured carbon matrix structure not only provides highly accessible channels for active site utilization but also dramatically facilitates mass transfer in the catalytic process. As expected, the Fe               0.5               Co@HOMNCP composite catalyst exhibits extraordinary ORR activity with a half‐wave potential of 0.903 V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode), surpassing most Co‐based catalysts reported to date. More remarkably, the use of the Fe               0.5               Co@HOMNCP catalyst as the air electrode in a zinc–air battery results in superior open‐circuit voltage and power density compared to a commercial Pt/C + IrO               2               catalyst. The results of this study are expected to inspire the development of advanced TM‐based catalysts for energy storage and conversion applications.","2022-04","2026-01-06 16:50:45","2026-01-08 04:55:47","2026-01-06 16:50:45","2109605","","17","34","","Advanced Materials","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\Administrator\Zotero\storage\U3K73UBJ\Li 等 - 2022 - Alloying Co Species into Ordered and Interconnected Macroporous Carbon Polyhedra for Efficient Oxyge.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

[1,2]               However, the performance of those devices is hindered by the sluggish kinetics of both OER and ORR, and by the low stability and high cost of the catalysts. Here, we will present our recent studies on the one-dimensional (1D) La, Ni-based metal oxide               [3]               bifunctional catalysts which are characterized by excellent OER and ORR electrocatalytic activity and outstanding stability.

Manganese (Mn)‐based catalysts, known for their reduced toxicity and promising durability, have traditionally exhibited lower ORR activity compared to state‐of‐the‐art iron‐nitrogen‐carbon (Fe‐N‐C) catalysts. In this study, a highly efficient Mn‐N‐C‐S catalyst is presented, engineered through a sulfur‐mediated high‐shell coordinated doping strategy, that markedly enhances ORR activity and stability. The Mn‐N‐C‐S catalyst achieves a record‐high half‐wave potential of 0.94 V in alkaline media, among the highest values reported for Mn‐based catalysts. Additionally, in acidic media, it exhibits a half‐wave potential of 0.80 V, placing it among the top‐performing M‐N‐C catalysts.

Replacement of Pt-based and transition metal-based electrocatalysts with efficient non-precious ORR catalysts is quite challenging so for [3-5]. Single-atom catalysts (SACs) based on first-row transition metals like Fe, Co, Cr have already received significant attention for ORR [6]. In this hunt, we have developed the rarely explored P-block earth abundant aluminium-based efficient and cost-effective ORR single atom catalyst. Nitrogen-doped Aluminium-based single atom catalyst has been synthesised by pyrolyzing aluminium phthalocyanine (AlPc) with dicyandiamide (DCDA) which is the source of carbon and nitrogen at different temperature and characterized by X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy. For comparison, AlPc has been pyrolyzed at 1000 °C without the addition of DCDA. The catalysts are named Al-N-C/T (T = 700 °C - 1000 °C) depending on the pyrolysis temperature. AlPc/1000 showed poor ORR activity with low diffusion-limited current of 0.76 mA/cm               2               (current measured at the potential of 0.3 V vs RHE). The insufficient catalytic activity of AlPc-1000 is due to the strong bonding of aluminium active centers with oxygenated group intermediate. But after the introduction of DCDA, the catalytic activity of Al-N-C/T (T = 700 °C - 1000 °C) has been improved significantly because N-bonded Al atoms have optimal bonding strength with intermediate oxygen species [7]. The coordination environment of Al-N-C plays an essential role in exhibiting excellent catalytic activity towards ORR. The Al-N-C/1000 catalyst exhibits the highest diffusion-limited current (4.49 mA/cm               2               ) as compared to all other Al-N-C/T (T = 700, 800, and 900 °C) based catalysts, along with more positive E               onset               (844 mV vs. RHE) and half-wave potential E               1/2               (749 mV vs RHE) (Figure 1). Electrochemical calculation further ropes the Al-Nx sites as the origin of ORR via an efficient 4-electron transfer pathway in basic medium. Importantly, negligible reduction in current density after 9000 cycles in alkaline medium is far superior to the durability limit set by the US department of energy and overpasses the state-of-the-art Pt/C catalyst (Figure 1). This methodology can be applied to design a variety of other alkaline earth, P block effective electrocatalysts.

Fe-N               x               -Cs are typically synthesized through pyrolysis using iron, nitrogen and/or carbon precursors of diverse nature. However, in general, pyrolysis is a process poorly understood despite recently a couple of manuscripts with in-situ investigations that have been presented [1-2]. The pyrolysis process defines the structural and chemical evolution of the electrocatalyst that ultimately governs its overall electroactivity. Therefore, in this study, the influence of pyrolysis conditions i.e. temperature (200-1000 °C) and atmosphere (Ar or Ar/H               2               ) on the morphological and superficial development of electrocatalyst was elucidated that initially consisted of Iron (II) Phthalocyanine (FePc) mixed with Ketjen Black 600. The morphological and chemical features were then correlated with the electrochemical performance in alkaline and acidic media through a structure-to-property relationship.                                         In-depth analysis showed that pyrolysis conditions significantly affect the nature and proportion of active Fe-based and nitrogen-based moieties that collaboratively determine the pathway and kinetics of the ORR in acid and alkaline media. X-ray diffraction (XRD) showed that reducing atmosphere (Ar/H               2               ) inhibits the crystallographic growth of Fe-containing nanoparticles. In parallel, the neutral atmosphere (Ar) enhanced the aggregation of Fe into oxides as diffraction peaks corresponded to Fe               3               O               4               after a pyrolysis temperature of 600°C. High-resolution-transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) showed the formation of nanoparticles and oxides at temperatures above 600°C. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) revealed multitudinous nitrogen-based moieties with varying proportions in the Fe-N               x               -C electrocatalysts developed under different pyrolysis conditions. Interestingly, the samples pyrolyzed in Ar/H               2               showed an increasing trend of Fe-N               x               with respect to a pyrolysis temperature whereas, in Ar-pyrolysed samples, Fe-N               x               started plummeting after 600°C. On the other hand, graphitic nitrogen increased prominently after 700°C in both pyrolytic conditions.                                         Using a rotating ring disc electrode (RRDE), the dependence of performance parameters on the chemical and structural features that evolved during the pyrolysis was clarified. Particularly, in acidic media (0.5 M H               2               SO               4               ), Fe-N               x               -C synthesized at 600 ºC under both Ar and Ar/H               2               conditions demonstrated higher electrocatalytic activity, with half-wave potentials (E               1/2               ) of                              ≈ 0.70-0.72 V (vs RHE) while maintaining the direct tetra-electronic ORR (low peroxide production). A similar trend was witnessed in an alkaline media (0.1 M KOH) but with relatively higher performance than in acid media. The highest onset potentials and E               1/2               observed in alkaline media were obtained by the Fe-N               x               -Cs pyrolyzed at 600°C and 700 ºC in both atmospheres i.e. Ar (E               1/2               ≈ 0. 89 V vs RHE) and Ar/H               2               (E               1/2               ≈ 0. 87 V vs RHE). A prompt reduction in the performance                              was highlighted at higher pyrolysis temperatures where an increase in peroxide yield might be related to the formation of iron oxide nanoparticles. This work presents a novel insight into the evolution of Fe-N               x               -C electrocatalysts during pyrolysis with optimum performance.

The content of N doping ranges from 2.1 to 6.6 at.% depending on the calcination temperature from 900 to 1050 °C. Compared with commercial Pt/C, the Co-containing nitrogen-doped hollow carbon spheres prepared at 900 °C (CoNHCS-900) as an ORR electrocatalyst shows a half-wave potential shift of only ∆E1/2 = 55 mV, but a superior stability of about 90.2% maintenance after 20,000 s in the O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH at a rotating speed of 1600 rpm. This could be ascribed to the synergistic effects of N-containing moieties, Co-Nx species, and Co nanoparticles, which significantly increase the density of active sites and promote the charge transfer during the ORR process.","2018-02-09","2026-01-06 16:36:09","2026-01-08 04:54:47","2026-01-06 16:36:09","11","","1","4","","C","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\Administrator\Zotero\storage\8KAV4327\Xing 等 - 2018 - Nitrogen-Doped Hollow Carbon Spheres with Embedded Co Nanoparticles as Active Non-Noble-Metal Electr.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In these applications, the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) are a key electrochemical process for commercialization. Also, developing non-noble metal-based electrocatalysts with high electrochemical performance is very important in economic point of view. To address these issues, electrocatalysts based on nanocarbon frameworks such as metal organic frameworks (MOFs) and zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) have been widely investigated as promising alternatives to Pt-based catalysts. In this work, we prepared bi-metallic ZIFs by coprecipitation of zinc and cobalt ions in the presence of 2-methylimidazole, followed by one-step sulfidation and carbonization to synthesize zinc cobalt sulfides supported on N, S co-doped porous carbon. The as-synthesized catalyst maintained inherent dodecahedral particle shape of ZIF. Furthermore, it exhibits outstanding ORR onset-potential (0.96 V vs. RHE) and half-wave potential (0.83 V vs. RHE), which is comparable to commercial Pt/C catalyst in alkaline electrolyte. Such outstanding electrochemical properties are mainly ascribed to the synergistic effect of the chemical composition, high electrochemical active surface area, and abundant active sites of the dodecahedral structure. These findings suggest that the transition metal sulfides on N, S co-doped porous carbon can be a promising alternative for the next generation of energy storage and conversion technologies.","2019-09-01","2026-01-06 16:36:12","2026-01-08 04:54:47","2026-01-06 16:36:12","2371-2371","","54","MA2019-02","","Meet.

However, its high cost and scarcity led to attention to non-precious metal catalysts (NPMCs) with anion exchange membrane [2]. One of the most promising NPMCs is iron and nitrogen co-doped carbon (Fe-N-C). Since nitrogen (N), iron (Fe) and carbon (C) are plentiful on the Earth, the cost of Fe-N-C is much lower than that of Pt-based catalysts. In order to improve the activity of Fe-N-C, various transition metals have been introduced. Among them, the introduction of copper (Cu) is expected to be able to achieve higher performance by imitating the cytochrome-c-oxidase structure [3]. In this study, the effect of different types of Cu precursors on the physical and electrochemical properties of Fe-N-C catalysts was investigated. Copper chloride, nitrate, sulfate, and acetate with different contents were applied to the preparation of Fe-N-C catalysts.                            Cu introduced Fe-N-C catalysts were named as Fe               x               Cu               y               -N-C (x and y are a molar ratio of Fe and Cu, respectively.). FeCu-N-C was synthesized by nano-replication of SBA-15 using iron chloride (FeCl               3               ), 1,10-phenanthroline, and Cu precursors, phosphoric acid and citric acid. For P doping, phosphoric acid was impregnated into silica pores. Citric acid was exploited as a carbon precursor and acid catalyst for polymerization simultaneously. After pyrolysis at 900 ˚C under Ar atmosphere for 3 h, silica was etched by 20 wt.% HF, followed by acid leaching with 0.5 M sulfuric acid at 80 ˚C for 8 h. After dried at 80 ˚C overnight, it was heat treated again under Ar+NH               3               atmosphere at 900 ˚C for 1 h.                                         From X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, N 1s spectra of all catalyst showed that the contents of graphitic N were about 50% due to two heat treatment steps. And amount of pyridinic N was about 30% of entire surface nitrogen. From elemental analysis technique, N content was about to be 3 at.%. During acid leaching and heat treatment most of unwanted iron clusters such as iron oxides and iron carbides with low number of carbon shells were eliminated from the surface. Therefore, less than 0.1 at.% of Fe and Cu were confirmed from Fe 2p and Cu 2p spectra. Hence, there were no obvious peaks from Fe or Cu crystal while only carbon peaks existed in X-ray diffraction pattern. Surface area and porosity of catalysts were investigated by N               2               adsorption and desorption technique. Surface areas were in the range of 1000-1050 m               2               /g, and pore volumes were about to be 1.1 cm               3               /g. Interestingly, with increasing content of citric acid, enlargement of mesopores from 4 to 5 nm was shown and transition of pore shape from slit to cylinder as confirmed by hysteresis of N               2               ads/des isotherm curve. It infers that citric acid can effectively help the nano-replication process by its bifunctional role.                                         With the different molar ratios of Fe and Cu, oxygen reduction activity was measured by a rotating disk electrode technique. Catalyst using CuSO               4               was used since its catalytic activity was superior to those of catalyst which used copper chloride or acetate. The half-wave potential of catalyst with Cu               1.0               was higher than other catalysts (918 mV), which is 16 mV higher than that (902 mV) of Fe-N-C. Cu-N-C had the lowest oxygen reduction activity (824 mV). Therefore, with proper content of Cu and type of precursor, optimized performance could be achieved.

Recently, non-precious metal catalysts (NPMCs) with high volumetric activity, low H               2               O               2               yield, and stability [1-2] have been developed as potential replacements for Pt-based oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts in the PEFC cathode.                                         State-of-the-art NPMCs have typically been synthesized from highly heterogeneous precursors [1,3,4], making understanding of the ORR active site in such catalysts particularly arduous. Catalysts based on graphene and graphene-oxide (GO) are more homogeneous and possess properties such as good chemical stability, excellent conductivity, and more importantly, can potentially be functionalized in a controlled manner [5]. GO inherently has a high defect density and can be modified with various functional moieties,               e.g.               carboxyl, hydroxyl, and epoxy groups using various synthesis techniques such as Hummer’s or Hoffman’s methods. The desire to have a high defect density arises from the possibility that defect sites may serve as niches for the chemical doping of heteroatoms, such as nitrogen (N) that have been proven to play a critical role in the overall performance of NPMCs. Further, the N-doped sites might serve as anchors for the coordination of transition metal atoms such as Fe, leading to the formation of the ORR active sites.                                         In this work, we have synthesized GO using different chemical routes and, subsequently, doped it with ammonia at various temperatures (500               o               C-900               o               C). Figures 1A and 1B display the respective SEM and HR-STEM images of the synthesized N-doped GO. The images indicate the preservation of graphene sheets after N doping, however, some amorphous content can also be seen in the sample. Figure 1C shows the electrochemical performance of the synthesized catalysts in oxygen reduction reaction measured using RDE. In a 0.5 M H               2               SO               4               electrolyte, a half-wave potential of 0.70 V and low peroxide formation were obtained. Conversely, in a 0.1 M NaOH electrolyte a half-wave potential of 0.85 V was observed. The catalyst is relatively stable in acidic conditions over 2000 cycles. A detailed ICP-MS study identified ppm levels of Mn and Fe in the sample, possibly due to the intrinsic GO synthesis method used. Results obtained using other characterization techniques, such as Raman and XPS, will be presented to further understand the role of the metal and nitrogen doping in the performance of GO-based catalysts.                          These first results indicate high performance of GO-based NPMCs in both acidic and alkaline media. Although, we have demonstrated effective oxygen reduction activity and have a better understanding of GO-based catalysts, we are now focusing our efforts on the synthesis of the model GO-based catalysts, free of any metal contaminants.

In this process, the adsorbed Cu ions exchange with Zn nodes in ZIF‐8 under high temperature, resulting in the trapping of Cu atoms within the cavities of the metal−organic framework, and thus forming Cu single‐atom catalysts.

The dealloyed AuNi nanodendrites (AuNi NDs) with tunable composition and uniformly elemental distribution are well developed by the one‐pot strategy. Impressively, the as‐synthesized AuNi NDs exhibit a higher electrochemically active area and definite improvements in electrocatalytic activity for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and borohydride oxidation reaction (BOR) compared to the commercial Pt/C. In particular, the AuNi NDs are 81 mV more positive in half‐wave potential and about 3.1 times higher in specific activity (at 0.85 V) for the ORR than Pt/C, together with excellent stability and methanol tolerance. The superior BOR activity is highly promising compared to the previously reported catalysts. The unique nanodendritic structure with Au‐rich surface and bimetallic electronic effect is the main factor to greatly enhance the bifunctional catalytic performance for the AuNi NDs. Furthermore, such a newly developed facile method is of great significance because it is one of the first examples to effectively engineer dealloyed bimetallic nanostructures via the practical and low‐cost route for electrocatalytic applications.","2017-06","2026-01-06 16:38:23","2026-01-08 04:54:42","2026-01-06 16:38:23","1700260","","23","27","","Adv Funct Materials","","","","","","","","en","http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/termsAndConditions#vor","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\Administrator\Zotero\storage\V6BYNHNY\Wang 等 - 2017 - One‐Pot Synthesis of Dealloyed AuNi Nanodendrite as a Bifunctional Electrocatalyst for Oxygen Reduct.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, previous reports on nitrogen doping have tended to result in a random distribution of nitrogen atoms, which leads to disordered electrostatic potential differences on the surface of carbon layers, limiting further control over the materials' electronic structure. Herein, a gradient nitrogen doping strategy to prepare nitrogen‐deficient graphene and nitrogen‐rich carbon nanotubes encapsulated cobalt nanoparticles catalysts (Co@CNTs@NG) is proposed. The unique gradient nitrogen doping leads to a gradual increase in the electrostatic potential of the carbon layer from the nitrogen‐rich region to the nitrogen‐deficient region, facilitating the directed electron transfer within these layers and ultimately optimizing the charge distribution of the material. Therefore, this strategy effectively regulates the density of state and work function of the material, further optimizing the adsorption of oxygen‐containing intermediates and enhancing ORR activity.

The (FeMn-DA)–N–C catalysts possess ample dual-metal atoms consisting of adjacent Fe-N               4               and Mn-N               4               sites on the carbon surface, yielded via a facile doping-adsorption-pyrolysis route. The introduction of Mn carries several advantageous attributes: increasing the number of active sites, effectively anchoring Fe due to effective electron transfer to Mn (revealed by X-ray absorption spectroscopy and density-functional theory (DFT), thus preventing the aggregation of Fe), and effectively circumventing the occurrence of Fenton reaction, thus reducing the consumption of Fe.

Usually, platinum (Pt) and platinum alloy (Pt alloy) are used in these devices, due to their good catalytic performance such as high oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity and high onset potential. However, Pt is very expensive in comparison with the other metal and non-metal catalysts, which limits commercialization of energy technologies. Cost-effective perovskite structure transition-metal oxide catalysts have shown reasonably high activity for the ORR as well as high electronic and ionic conductivity.[1] Especially, LaMnO               3+δ               exhibits the highest ORR activity value among perovskite catalysts because it satisfies the Sabatier’s principle as possessing approximately 1 electron in               e               g               band of               d               orbital.[2]                                         In the catalytic reaction, nanometer-sized (<10 nm) particles possess a large surface area which leads to a high catalytic efficiency; however, it is hard to achieve nanometer-sized particles from typical chemical reaction synthesis. Laser ablation synthesis in solution (LASiS), which is a simple, fast, and clean process, is suitable to achieve nanometer-sized pure LaMnO               3+δ               particles by controlling laser parameters. In this study, we fabricated the LaMnO               3+δ               catalyst powder which has large surface area for improving catalytic efficiency using LASiS. Also, we compared the ORR efficiency among synthesized LaMnO               3+δ               /GCB powder, LaMnO               3+δ               bulk, and Pt/C through a rotation disk electrode (RDE) method.                                         The LaMnO               3+δ               target for LASiS was prepared using solid state reaction with La               2               O               3               and MnO               2               powder. The powder was put in zirconia jar with isopropyl alcohol (IPA) and zirconia ball, and then mixed using planetary ball mill for 120 minutes. Mixed powder was dried at 100°C in oven and then calcined at 900°C for 12 hours under air atmosphere in furnace. A disk- pellet was made using cold isostatic pressure (CIP) method. The pellets were sintered at 1200°C for 24 hours under the air atmosphere. The target soaked in ethanol was ablated to a Q-switched Nd:YAG pulsed laser source providing a 8-ns pulse width with wavelength of 266 nm with repetition rate of 10 Hz. The laser energy and spot size were around 65 mJ/pulse and 1.5 mm respectively, which corresponded to a laser energy density of 3.67 J/cm               2               . Colloidal solution from LASiS was mixed with 6M HCl treated GCB before drying at 80°C in oven and then obtained powder were annealed at 500°C to 800°C for 30 minutes under the air atmosphere in furnace. We found that the synthesized LaMnO               3+δ               /GCB                              powder annealed at 800°C for 30 minutes shows the highest ORR activity. Its half wave potential value was around 0.83 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (vs. RHE), corresponding to around 150 mV higher than bulk LaMnO               3+δ               . Also, the conventional Tafel plot results indicate that the ORR efficiency of LaMnO               3+δ               /GCB catalyst is similar to that of Pt/C 20 wt%.

The results indicate that the content of the CoNi alloy distributed on the carbon fiber surface increased from 26.7 wt.% to 38.4 wt.% with an increase in the feed speed of the inner axis. However, the excessive precipitation of the CoNi alloy on the carbon fiber surface leads to the segregation of the internal CoNi alloy, which is unfavorable for the exposure of active sites during the electrolytic reaction. The best electrocatalytic performance of the composite was achieved when the rate of the outer axis feed speed was constant (3 mm/h) and the rate of the inner axis was 1.5 mm/h. The initial oxygen reduction potential and half-slope potential were 0.99 V and 0.92 V (VS RHE), respectively.

The samples were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray spectroscopy, adsorption isotherms, inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry, and Raman spectroscopy. The presence of iron and nitrogen in the carbons increases the onset potential toward oxygen reduction in KOH 0.1 mol L−1 by 130 mV (0.83 V), in comparison to carbonized glucose, whereas the reaction mechanism shifts closer to a direct pathway and the formation of HO2− decreases to 25% (3.5 electrons).

The CD‐modified Fe‐SAC (Fe‐SNC‐β‐CD) shows obviously improved activity toward the ORR with 0.90 V, 4.10 and 4.09 mA cm               −2               for               E               1/2               , J               0               and J               k0.9               , respectively. Meanwhile, the Fe‐SNC‐β‐CD shows the excellent long‐term stability against aggressive stress and the poisoning. It is confirmed through electrochemical investigation that modification of β‐CD can, on one hand, regulate the atomic Fe coordination chemistry through the interaction between the CD and FeN               x               moiety, while on the other mitigate the strong adsorption of OH               −               and function as protective barrier against the poisoning molecules leading to enhanced ORR activity and stability for the Fe‐SACs. The molecular encapsulation strategy demonstrates the uniqueness of post‐pyrolysis surface molecular engineering for the design of single‐atom catalyst.","2023-03","2026-01-06 16:45:24","2026-01-08 04:54:38","2026-01-06 16:45:24","e12346","","2","6","","Energy &amp; Environ Materials","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\Administrator\Zotero\storage\8PKIQIIH\Chen 等 - 2023 - Surface Molecular Encapsulation with Cyclodextrin in Promoting the Activity and Stability of Fe Sing.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Platinum‐based catalysts are considered efficient ORR catalysts due to their high activity. However, the degradation of Pt species leads to poor durability of catalysts, limiting their applications in PEMFCs. Herein, a Janus heterostructure is designed for high durability ORR in acidic media.

The flexible Zn-air battery equipping Fe/ZnS-SNC900 affords a higher open-circuit voltage (1.45 V) and power density of 30.2 mW cm−2. Fuel cells assembled with Fe/ZnS-SNC900 as cathodic catalysts deliver a higher power output of 388.3 and 242.8 mW cm−2 in H2-O2 and -air conditions. This work proposes advanced heterostructured ORR electrocatalysts that effectively promote renewable energy conversions.","2023-09-30","2026-01-06 16:48:24","2026-01-08 04:54:36","2026-01-06 16:48:24","2682","","19","13","","Nanomaterials","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\Administrator\Zotero\storage\VD6YABTE\Pei 等 - 2023 - Constructing FeS and ZnS Heterojunction on N,S-Codoped Carbon as Robust Electrocatalyst toward Oxyge.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Herein, a molecular‐atomic coupled catalyst is constructed by integrating iron phthalocyanine (FePc) molecules with Fe‐N               4               atomic sites anchored on nitrogen‐doped carbon nanotubes (FePc‐Fe‐NCNT).

This unique hollow structure endows the catalyst with a high specific surface area as well as more exposed active sites. Also benefited from the synergistic effect between Ni and Co nanoparticles, the Ni–Co@NHC catalyst leads to an outstanding ORR performance of half-wave potential (               E               1/2               , 0.862 V), outperforms that of commercial Pt/C catalyst. Additionally, when Ni–Co@NHC was used in the cathode for the zinc-air battery, the cell exhibits high power density (108 mW cm               −2               ) and high specific capacity (806 mAh g               −1               ) at 20 mA cm               −2               outperforming Pt/C. This work offers a promising design strategy for the development of high-performance ORR electrocatalysts.","2022-02-05","2026-01-06 16:35:29","2026-01-06 16:35:29","2026-01-06 16:35:29","065409","","6","33","","Nanotechnology","","","","","","","","","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\Administrator\Zotero\storage\SKUJB6G4\Zhang 等 - 2022 - ZIF-67-derived N-doped double layer carbon cage as efficient catalyst for oxygen reduction reaction.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The properties of mesoporous carbon materials base on not only the sizes and location of the pore, but the heteroatoms doped into the carbon framework. Abundant experimental studies have certified that chemical doping of mesoporous carbon with foreign atoms, especially nitrogen and sulfur, can improve its electrochemical properties of ORR, as well as lead to new functions               5               . It is believed that the quantity of N-doped and S-doped in carbon will be vastly different if it was annealed at various reaction temperatures               6               .

After dried overnight, the resulting solid was ground to a fine powder, and then calcined at temperatures from 700, 800 and 900℃ to form the different structure for 1h in nitrogen atmosphere. The excess amount of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) was added to vacate the silica and the resulting powder was acid-leached using 0.5 M H               2               SO               4               at 80℃ to remove the unreacted metallic Fe. Then, the catalytic graphitization of the impregnated carbon was subjected heat treatment at 700 to 900℃ for 1h pyrolyzation time again.                          Besed on these method, we obain the mesoporous carbon with high porosity, and the electrocatalytic activity on the it was investigated using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) employing rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE)                            Fig. 1 shows CV responses of Fe-LH-800℃ in N               2               /O               2               saturated 0.1 M KOH solution. In the case of a N               2               -saturated solution, the cyclic voltammogram only presents a featureless quasi-rectangular trace. However, when O               2               is introduced into the solution, a distinct ORR response with the peak potential (E               p               ) at 0.82 V vs. RHE, and the peak current density (I               p               ) of 3.61 mA cm               -2               can be clearly observed, indicating that this Fe-LH-800℃ catalyst has a profound catalytic ORR activity. Fig. 2 shows the polarization curves of the Fe-LH-700℃, Fe-LH-800℃ and Fe-LH-900℃ catalysts.

Furthermore, electrochemical studies show that the O–Co–N/C catalyst retains comparable ORR activity to common M–N–C materials with a half‐wave potential of 0.85 V vs the reversible hydrogen electrode and better OER activity with an overpotential of 0.29 V at the current density of 10 mA cm               −2               . This study provides insights into the development of effective oxygen‐involving electrocatalysts with bifunctional metal active centers coordinated by both nitrogen and oxygen atoms.","2022-06","2026-01-06 17:11:15","2026-01-08 04:53:29","2026-01-07 15:51:22","2200763","","23","32","","Adv Funct Materials","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\Administrator\Zotero\storage\2NQ9R7EA\Zhang 等 - 2022 - Oxygen‐Rich Cobalt–Nitrogen–Carbon Porous Nanosheets for Bifunctional Oxygen Electrocatalysis.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Compared with the direct pyrolysis of polypyrrole@cobalt salt precursor, the incorporation of dicyanodiamide as the CVD source facilitates the diversification and hierarchization of carbon morphology, the reduction of Co particle size, and the increase of the proportion of interfacial Co−N−C and pyridinic‐N.

After calcination, the cobalt ions from Co-bpdc were converted into Co nanoparticles, which were distributed in the graphite carbon layers and MWCNTs to form Co-bpdc/MWCNTs.

This high ORR activity originates from the atomically dispersed Fe coordinated with nitrogen atoms (Fe−N               x               site). However, the rational design that can create abundant active Fe−N               x               site remains an important challenge. In this work, we demonstrate that a silica-coating-mediated synthetic strategy enables the preparation of Fe−N/C catalysts enriched with active Fe−N                                x                              sites while mitigating the formation of less active Fe and Fe               3               C species. The silica coating-mediated strategy was generally applicable to various types of Fe and N precursors, including iron porphyrin, iron acetate/1,10-phenanthroline, and iron chloride/polyaniline. This strategy was also effective in the preparation of Fe−N/C catalysts with various carbon supports and with a wide range of Fe contents and pyrolysis temperatures. The strategy could be further extended to S- or P-doped Fe−N/C catalysts, in which the formation of inactive FeS and Fe               2               P species was suppressed. Significantly, the S-doped Fe−N/C catalyst exhibited very high ORR activity with half-wave potential at 0.91 V (vs. RHE) in alkaline media. In anion-exchange membrane fuel cell tests, the S-doped Fe−N/C based cathode showed a current density of 977 mA cm               −2               at 0.6 V, which is the highest performance among reported AMEFCs with NPMC-based cathodes. The S-doped Fe−N/C-based cathode also demonstrated promising volumetric current density in an acidic proton exchange membrane fuel cell. Thus, the silica-coating-mediated strategy is generally effective in preparing atomically dispersed catalytic entities and may be applicable to other catalytic reactions whereby atomically dispersed catalysts exhibit high catalytic activities.","2019-09-01","2026-01-06 16:52:26","2026-01-08 04:55:44","2026-01-06 16:52:26","1654-1654","","36","MA2019-02","","Meet.

It is essential to identify abundant, active, and stable materials to enable the reliable and cost-efficient use of catalysts in renewable technologies such as fuel cells (FCs) and electrolyzers. Suitable candidates, like nonprecious metals, can be found in the transition metals' first row, where materials like bimetallics, metal oxides, and metal nitrides can be obtained. Recently, these materials have shown high activity toward the Oxygen Reduction Reaction (ORR) and the Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER) in an alkaline medium, which can be related to good performance in FCs and electrolyzers. However, most of the studies do not go further than half-cell reactions. In this study, we explored the synthesis of a metal nitride, Ni               3               FeN, and its application as a cathode material in hydrogen fuel Anion Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells (AEMFC). A one-step ammonolysis synthesis was done to obtain Ni               3               FeN supported on carbon. Various metal loadings were synthesized with nanoparticles sizes of 7 ± 2 nm and 10 ± 4 nm for 40% and 60%, respectively, revealed with Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). High-resolution Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) images and Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) mapping analysis revealed a metal nitride core and a metal oxide shell of ca. 3 nm. The bulk electronic structure was further evaluated using X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS), where the EXAFS modeling suggests a bulk nitride electronic structure. Consequently, cyclic voltammetry (CV) was used to investigate the electrochemical properties and ORR performance of the Ni               3               FeN catalyst in 1 M KOH. The catalyst exhibited a stable electrochemical structure with a slight decrease in E               1/2               of 10 mV (from 0.85 V to 0.84 V) during a 100 K ORR accelerated durability test (ADT). In addition, Levich and Rotating Ring Disk Electrode (RRDE) analyses showed that the number of electrons transferred during the ORR was consistent with a 4-electron pathway. Furthermore, the Ni               3               FeN catalyst was tested as the cathode in an AEMFC, obtaining a power density output of 400 mW/cm               2               , highlighting its potential for alkaline medium fuel cell applications.","2023-12-22","2026-01-06 16:52:22","2026-01-08 04:55:44","2026-01-06 16:52:22","2039-2039","","41","MA2023-02","","Meet.

In this study, we report simple carbonization of evaporation-induced self-assembled iron(III) porphyrin (FeP) layers uniformly coated on carbon black, leading to an unprecedented core/shell structured NPME composed of multi-layered N-doped graphite uniformly coated on carbon black. The thickness of graphite carbon shell can be readily adjusted up to about 7 nm by varying the amount of FeP loaded on carbon black. Interestingly, the obtained NPME exhibited a high ORR activity in both alkaline (half-wave potential of 0.87 V               vs.               RHE) and acidic (half-wave potential of 0.75 V               vs.               RHE) media, which is one of the highest ORR activities of NPMEs in document. In particular, the core/shell structured NPME demonstrated a remarkable durability in acidic conditions suprior to that of commerical Pt/C, which appears to be closely related to the multi-layered graphite shell. It is very likely that after the outermost graphite layer is consumed, the inner one becomes available and thus effectively maintains the original ORR activity. Furthermore, the core/shell NPME displayed nearly direct 4e and indirect 4e process toward ORR in alkaline and acidic media, respectively. This study pointed out a new avenue for the creation of high-performance NPMEs in both alkaline and acidic media by heat-treating self-assembled metallomacrocycles on various substrates, which may have potential applications in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), metal-air batteries, and electrolyzers.","2017-04-15","2026-01-06 16:52:53","2026-01-08 04:55:43","2026-01-06 16:52:53","870-870","","14","MA2017-01","","Meet.

However, their ORR activity is unsatisfactory. Besides, the structure‐activity relationship via tuning the coordination environment of the second coordination shell for transition metal single sites is still elusive. Here, a Mn SAC with O doping in the second‐shell of atomically dispersed Mn centers (MnSAC‐O/C) as highly efficient and stable ORR catalyst is developed. X‐ray absorption spectroscopy combined with theoretical calculations verifies the O doping in the second‐shell of Mn center, and reveals the distortion of local environment of Mn center in the MnSAC‐O/C. The MnSAC‐O/C exhibits high ORR performance with a half‐wave potential of 0.898 V, superior to MnSAC‐C, commercial Pt/C and most reported non‐noble metal‐based SACs. More importantly, MnSAC‐O/C based zinc‐air batteries (ZABs) deliver outstanding durability with stable operation exceeding 930 h.

However, the electrocatalytic activity of heteroatom‐modulated carbon rarely reaches the level of metal‐based electrocatalysts. Here, electron‐rich carbon and abundant pyridinic‐N adjacent to C vacancies decorated with carbon nanosheets (E‐NC‐V) are synthesized and used as the host for boosting efficient oxygen reduction reaction.

Current efforts mainly focus on optimal chemical doping and substituent to tune its electronic structures for enhanced activity. Here, we study its morphology control and elucidate the morphology-dependent catalyst performance for bifunctional oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Three types of NiCo               2               O               4               catalysts with significantly different morphologies were prepared using temple-free, Pluronic-123 (P-123) soft, and SiO               2               hard templates, respectively,               via               hydrothermal methods following by a calcination. While the hard-template yields sphere-like dense structures, soft-template assists the formation of a unique nano-needle cluster and flower-like assembly containing abundant meso- and macro pores.

Meanwhile, remarkable OER activity and stability were achieved with an onset potential of 1.48 V and a current density of 15 mA/cm               2               at 1.6 V, showing no activity loss after 20,000 potential cycles (0 to 1.9 V). The demonstrated stability is even superior to Ir for the OER. The morphology-controlled approach provides an effective solution to create a robust 3D architecture with increased surface areas and enhanced mass transfer. Importantly, the soft template can yield high degree of spinel crystallinity with ideal stoichiometric ratios between Ni and Co, thus promoting structural integrity with enhanced electrical conductivity and catalytic properties. The high performance bifunctional oxide catalyst is carbon free and can eventually overcome the stability issue resulting from carbon corrosion in reversible fuel cells and metal-air batteries.","2018-04-13","2026-01-06 16:53:42","2026-01-08 04:55:41","2026-01-06 16:53:42","1695-1695","","29","MA2018-01","","Meet.

Additionally, the durability of the as‐prepared FeCo−N,S@CNFs catalysts was maintained for 14 h with long‐term stability and high tolerance to methanol stability, accounting for their excellent catalytic ability. Furthermore, Co−N@CNFs, Fe−N@CNFs, and varying Fe and Co ratios were compared with those of FeCo−N,S@CNFs. Synergistic interactions between metals and heteroatoms were believed to play a significant role in enhancing the ORR activity. Owing to their excellent catalytic reduction ability, the as‐prepared FeCo−N,S@CNFs can be widely used in battery‐based systems and replace commercial Pt/C in fuel cell applications.","2023-01-09","2026-01-06 16:54:17","2026-01-08 04:55:41","2026-01-06 16:54:17","e202201528","","1","16","","ChemSusChem","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\Administrator\Zotero\storage\SLFDNRMP\Son 等 - 2023 - N,S‐co‐doped FeCo Nanoparticles Supported on Porous Carbon Nanofibers as Efficient and Durable Oxyge.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Pyridinic‐N‐C is believed to be the most active N group for catalyzing ORR. In this work, using zinc phthalocyanine as a precursor effectively overcomes the serious loss of pyridinic‐N, which is commonly regarded as the biggest obstacle to catalytic performance enhancement upon adopting a second pyrolysis process, for the preparation of a 3D porous N‐doped carbon framework (NDCF). The results show only ≈14% loss in pyridinic‐N proportion in the Zn‐containing sample during the second pyrolysis process. In comparison, a loss of ≈72% pyridinic‐N occurs for the non‐Zn counterpart. The high pyridinic‐N proportion, the porous carbon framework produced upon NaCl removal, and the increased mesoporous defects in the second pyrolysis process make the as‐prepared catalyst an excellent electrocatalyst for ORR, exhibiting a half‐wave potential (               E               1/2               = 0.88 V) up to 33 mV superior to state‐of‐the‐art Pt/C and high four‐electron selectivity (               n               > 3.83) in alkaline solution, which is among the best ORR activities reported for N‐doped carbon catalysts.

Herein, a kind of high‐density iron network‐like sites catalysts are constructed with optimized intermetallic distances on an amino‐functionalized carbon matrix (Fe‐HDNSs).

To address these challenges, an integrated strategy is proposed combining core‐shell heterophase catalytic species with superhydrophobic properties. The H─CoFe─CNT catalyst, featuring carbon nanotube‐grown hollow cubic carbon cages, incorporates metal carbide@metal core‐shell heterophase catalytic species and exhibits superhydrophobicity. The metal carbide@metal core‐shell structure modulates the electronic state of catalytic sites, reduces the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) energy barrier, and enhances catalytic activity. Meanwhile, the superhydrophobic property of the catalyst creates an abundant triple‐phase reaction interface, promotes oxygen accumulation at the air cathode, thereby improving ORR kinetics and boosting the power density of ZABs. The as‐prepared H─CoFe─CNT catalyst demonstrates exceptional oxygen electrocatalytic activity, achieving a high ORR half‐wave potential of 0.909 V and a low oxygen evolution reaction (OER) overpotential of 307 mV. Liquid ZABs assembled with this catalyst exhibit a peak power density of 255 mW cm               −2               , and outstanding durability. Moreover, quasi‐solid‐state ZABs deliver an ultrahigh peak power density of 610 mW cm               −2               , indicating promising practical applicability.

Although iron and nitrogen co‐doped carbon material (Fe–N–C) is a promising alternative to scarce and expensive platinum‐based electrocatalysts, the linear scaling relationships among the intermediates’ adsorption energy limit maximum performance. Herein, we propose a coordination‐adaptive catalyst design to bypass the intrinsic scaling relations through incorporating quasi‐covalent Fe─F bond. Operando experiments and theoretical calculations demonstrate that the cleavage of Fe‐F bond facilitates the activation of O               2               and the formation of OOH*, while the self‐healing of Fe─F bond regulates the binding strength with O* and OH*, thus breaking the OH*‐OOH*/O* scaling relations.

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the SWCNTs surface can be activated by the encapsulated PdMo NWs to achieve the exclusive adsorption of O               2               and the following reduction reaction. In addition, PdMo NWs@SWCNTs demonstrate excellent catalytic performance as the cathode of lithium‐oxygen batteries. The cell can reach a high discharge capacity of over 10 000 mAh g               −1               , better than most of the former reported catalytic electrodes.

However, achieving high‐density Fe‐N               4               active sites while precisely modulating their microenvironment to enhance ORR activity remains a formidable challenge. Here, an S‐mediated strategy is presented for the preparation of Fe single‐atom‐loaded S,N‐doped carbon (FeNSC). This strategy leverages the interactions between S and N during pyrolysis to significantly suppress N loss, thereby achieving a high density of Fe‐N               4               sites. Concurrently, the precise doping of S into the second coordination shell of Fe‐N               4               centers modulates their electronic structure, leading to a significant weakening of               *               O and               *               OH intermediates adsorption during the ORR.

Due to encapsulation of the Fe               3               C nanoparticles inside porous b‐NCNTs, the reported NPMC retains its high ORR activity after around 70 hours in both alkaline and acidic media.","2017-09-07","2026-01-06 17:06:43","2026-01-08 04:55:26","2026-01-06 17:06:43","12125-12130","","50","23","","Chemistry A European J","MOF‐Templated Assembly Approach for Fe<sub>3</sub> C Nanoparticles Encapsulated in Bamboo‐Like N‐Doped CNTs","","","","","","","en","http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/termsAndConditions#vor","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\Administrator\Zotero\storage\X5BUH23N\Aijaz 等 - 2017 - MOF‐Templated Assembly Approach for Fe3 C Nanoparticles Encapsulated in Bamboo‐Like N‐Dop.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To pave the development of this promising power source, the atomically dispersed transition metal‐nitrogen‐carbon (M‐N‐C) materials with low cost and high ORR performance have allured to investigate their ammonia tolerance during the ORR. Herein, it is initially deconvoluted how compositional and structural elements of FeN               4               sites modulate catalyst's performance. Furthermore, ORR catalytic activities of the M‐N‐C (M = Fe, Co or Mn) and Pt/C catalysts are investigated in ammonia‐containing electrolytes, showing that M‐N‐C catalysts have better ammonia tolerance than Pt/C. Among others, the Fe‐N‐C exhibits the best ammonia tolerance with only 4 mV negative shifts of half‐wave potential, 2.7% decrease of current, and negligibly irreversible activity loss. The superior ammonia tolerance of MN               4               sites to Pt (111) surface is further confirmed by density functional theory calculations.

In this work, a facile wet chemical method for synthesizing Pd nanosheets and PdPtNi trimetallic alloy nanosheets is developed. Without the introduction of gaseous CO and pressurized equipment, Pd nanosheets with a thickness of ≈2.85 nm and sizes in the range of 1–2 µm can be obtained.

The catalyst CA‐Fe/MF‐N900 (calcinated at 900 °C) exhibits the best ORR performance. In alkaline electrolyte, the ORR current starts at 0.98 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). The half‐wave potential (E                 1/2                 ) is 0.83 V versus RHE, and the limiting current density reaches 5.3 mA cm                 −2                 . After 1000 cycles, E                 1/2                 merely shifts negatively by 7 mV. The Zn–air battery fabricated with the CA‐Fe/MF‐N900 as the cathode catalyst displays outstanding discharging performance with peak power density of 158 mW cm                 −2                 and long‐term stability. The enhanced catalytic activity can be attributed to the advanced 3D interconnected porous architecture of the Fe–N–C catalyst, which can not only accommodate abundant active sites but also significantly reduce the mass/charge transfer resistance.","2020-06","2026-01-06 17:07:33","2026-01-08 04:55:26","2026-01-06 17:07:33","2000149","","6","8","","Energy Tech","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\Administrator\Zotero\storage\A7MC3ST3\Liu 等 - 2020 - Three‐Dimensional Porous Fe–N–C Derived from Iron‐Citrate‐Functionalized Melamine Foam as a Highly A.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, Zn single-atom catalysts (SACs) were demonstrated as effective oxygen reduction reaction catalysts with high anti-poisoning properties by density functional theory calculation and the Zn SACs anchoring on an N, P-doped carbon substrate (Zn-SAC@PNC) was synthesized by a one-pot strategy.

Inspired by the edge‐rich and ordered tile that facilitates rainwater runoff, an orderly stacked “tile” carbon with highly dispersed SA Fe and doped S is prepared through the morphology‐persistent conversion of a new metal–organic framework with a “tile” assembly. The catalyst exhibits a higher half‐wave potential of 0.91 V in 0.1 M KOH, when compared with that of Pt/C and Fe atoms on a lamellar carbon. This is because the reaction kinetics is accelerated by the “tile” carbon architecture while the doped S weakens the Fe–O interaction, and decreases the *OH binding strength. Importantly, the catalyst, working at the air cathodes, powers the liquid and the solid‐state Zn–air batteries to show high‐power density and remarkable stability, and can effectively charge a mobile phone. This work not only provides an effective catalyst but also highlights the importance of “tile” architecture for developing advanced catalysts.","2025-08","2026-01-06 17:10:57","2026-01-08 04:55:25","2026-01-06 17:10:57","2502834","","34","35","","Adv Funct Materials","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\Administrator\Zotero\storage\2RDNUJ5W\Zhang 等 - 2025 - Orderly Stacked “Tile” Architecture with Single‐Atom Iron Boosts Oxygen Reduction in Liquid and Soli.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Herein, duck blood containing heme (a type of ferriporphyrin) is carbonized and activated to obtain Fe, N doped carbon. The activated carbonized blood (a‐CB) exhibits an extremely high specific surface area of 2655 m               2                g               –               1               .

The onset and half‐wave potentials are 0.95 and 0.77 V vs. RHE, respectively. These values are comparable to those of commercial Pt/C (20 wt.‐%) catalyst.

Compared to artificial porous heteroatom doped carbon materials, this work seeks raw materials from natural biomass waste to obtain efficient carbon substrate with both high porosity and Fe, N self‐doping feature for catalyst applications.","2020-10-31","2026-01-06 17:07:52","2026-01-08 04:55:25","2026-01-06 17:07:52","3869-3876","","40","2020","","Eur J Inorg Chem","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\Administrator\Zotero\storage\GJDM6PBE\Zhang 等 - 2020 - Co3 O4 on Fe, N Doped Bio‐Carbon Substrate for Electrocatalysis of Oxygen Redu.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

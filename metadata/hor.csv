Here, we successfully synthesized alloy electrocatalyst with separated phases, PtRu alloy nanoparticles robustly supported by carbon matrix (PtRu/C), using a convenient two-step solvothermal method. The constructed PtRu/C at different NaOH contents (0–1.25 mmol) were compared and electrochemical activity were evaluated by the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR). In contrast, the homogeneous distribution and minimum average size of Ru and Pt nanoparticles on carbon, appeared at approximately 4 nm, proving that PtRu/C-0.75 possessed abundant accessible active sites. The catalytic activities and the reaction mechanism were studied via electrochemical techniques. PtRu/C-0.75 has excellent activity due to its unique electronic structure and efficient charge transfer, with the largest j               0               value of 3.68 mA cm               −2               in the HOR.","2022-05-31","2026-01-07 12:23:15","2026-01-07 12:23:15","2026-01-07 12:23:15","885965","","","10","","Front.

One significant challenge has been the development of hydrogen catalysts that can be utilized in alkaline environments as the kinetics of hydrogen reactions decrease by two orders of magnitude in alkaline environments compared to acidic               [1,2]               . Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is a conventional tool used in the synthesis of such catalysts               [3,4]               . This presentation discusses the extending work being done using a variant CVD process known as “Poor Man’s” CVD (PMCVD), to further its impact in electrochemical catalyst application               [5]               . PMCVD is utilizes an inexpensive vacuum oven to sublime commercially available metal-organic precursors; lowering synthesis cost while providing increased control of particle size and distribution. This work describes the work done to assess the PMCVD mechanisms as well as its use to develop catalysts for the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline environments.                          Preliminary studies have shown that PMCVD can develop catalysts with highly dispersed nanoparticles on various supports. As depicted in Figure 1, PMCVD synthesized Pt/C and PtRu/C catalysts have shown to have improved kinetics over commercial developed catalysts exhibiting approximately a 40% and 45% increase in average exchange current densities respectively when compared to Tanaka Kikinzoku catalysts of the same loading. An extended function of the PMVCD process is the ability to synthesize alloyed catalysts in a single deposition process. By understanding the parametric effects of temperature and pressure on the deposition process with respect to particle size and distribution, we can optimize the PMCVD process to develop highly active catalysts that can be used in alkaline hydrogen systems.

While significant progress has been made in efficient nonnoble electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction in alkaline media, the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) in the alkaline condition still relies on high platinum loadings to compensate for its sluggish kinetics. Therefore, developing efficient non-noble metal electrocatalysts with Pt-like HOR performances in alkaline electrolytes is highly desired but a great challenge.             The hydrogen binding energy (HBE) has been identified as the primary descriptor for the HOR. Additionally, an unfavorable hydroxide binding energy (OHBE) is considered the rate-determining step in the Volmer reaction to generate water. Therefore, an ideal catalyst for HOR should achieve a balance between HBE and OHBE. However, despite being a promising non-noble metal, nickel exhibits excessively high HBE and lacks active sites for hydroxide adsorption, which hinders its further application in the real fuel cell.                            In this work, NiW was successfully deposited onto Cu to form a ternary Ni-Cu-W alloy catalyst by a chemical reduction method. Through XPS spectra, we found the charge transfer from Ni to W to give Ni a higher valence state, contributing to a weakened hydrogen binding energy. Electrochemical measurements observed Ni-Cu-W exhibit an kinetic activity with 117.9 mA/mg               Ni               at η= 50 mV, which is the highest among the reported platinum group metal-free catalysts. Ni-Cu-W alloy showcased robust stability, with no activity degradation during an accelerated long-term durability test between a low overpotential (-0.1 ~ 0.1 V, vs RHE) with 10,000 cyclic voltammetry scans and only a 5.7% activity loss at η= 50 mV when applying more larger overpotential (-0.1 ~ 0.2 V) with the same cycles. When assembled with this catalyst as anode and Pt/C as cathode, it delivered a peak power density of 289 mW/cm               2               . Both experimental and theoretical studies were conducted to gain insights into the catalyst's enhanced performance. Our findings revealed that the incorporation of Cu into the catalyst significantly weakened the adsorption of hydrogen species, while simultaneously lowering the energy barrier required for the absorption of hydroxide ions. These key observations might shed light on the underlying mechanisms responsible for the catalyst's improved activity and stability.","2024-08-09","2026-01-07 12:25:40","2026-01-07 12:25:40","2026-01-07 12:25:40","2037-2037","","36","MA2024-01","","Meet.

Ni‐Mo alloy and nickel nitride have been proven to improve the Ni‐based activities of HOR but they still can be further enhanced. Because it sacrifices the HBE for enlarging OHBE.

The approach combines high mass transport with a flat, uniform, and homogeneous catalyst deposition process, well suited for studying intrinsic catalyst properties at realistic operating conditions of a polymer electrolyte fuel cell (PEFC). Uniform catalyst layers were produced with loadings as low as 0.16 μg               Pt                cm               -2               and thicknesses as low as 200 nm, Figure 1. Such ultra thin catalyst layers are considered advantageous to minimize internal resistances and mass transport limitations leading to very high performance at low platinum loadings. Modelling of the associated diffusion field suggests that such high performance is enabled by fast lateral diffusion within the electrode. The electrodes operate over a wide potential range with insignificant mass transport losses, allowing the study of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) at high overpotentials. For the HOR, geometric current densities as high as 5.7 A cm               -2               Geo               were experimentally achieved at a loading of 10.15 μg               Pt                cm               -2               at room temperature (561 A mg               Pt               -1               ), which is three orders of magnitude higher than current densities achievable with the RDE. These currents correspond to a specific current densities of 600 ± 60 mA cm               -2               Spec               , although this maximum appears to be related - to the hydrogen adsorption process.

The mass activities of Pt/C catalysts towards the ORR was found to exceed a range of literature PEFC mass activities across the entire potential range.

The primary benefit of AEM systems is the potential ability to use less expensive, non-platinum (Pt) group metal (PGM) catalysts, and the non-PGM stability that the alkaline environment allows. While these systems have had polymer limitations, recent improvements in the chemical stability of alkaline membranes suggest that catalysts will become the limiting factor in the near future.[1, 2]             Catalyst development in AEM systems typically focuses on oxygen reduction and evolution, since the reactions are kinetically orders of magnitude slower than hydrogen oxidation and evolution. Alternatives, however, exist to PGMs in these reactions: silver in oxygen reduction; and nickel and cobalt in oxygen evolution.[3, 4] While hydrogen oxidation and evolution are kinetically faster reactions, they are roughly two orders of magnitude slower on Pt in base compared to acidic environments. Non-PGM catalyst options are also less clear, and generally struggle to justify the AEM cost benefit, producing activities orders of magnitude lower than PGMs at higher overpotentials.[5]             Recently, advanced Pt electrocatalysts have been developed in an effort to thrift the amount of PGMs in AEM fuel cells and electrolyzers. Pt-nickel (Ni) nanowires, previously developed for acidic oxygen reduction, were studied for their activity in hydrogen oxidation and evolution.[6] These materials were formed by spontaneous galvanic displacement, a process that occurs when a metal template contacts a nobler metal cation. At low levels of displacement, small amounts of Pt were deposited to produce high electrochemical surface areas. Subsequent post-synthesis processing was used to integrate the Pt-rich and Ni-rich zones, compressing the Pt lattice and improving its activity for hydrogen oxidation and evolution. Compared to carbon-supported Pt nanoparticles (Pt/HSC), Pt-Ni nanowires produced hydrogen oxidation/evolution exchange current densities 9 times greater.             Figure 1.

Polymer electrolyte fuel cell uses hydrogen as a fuel that only produces water as byproduct which does not cause any pollution. Currently, commercialized Nafion-based polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) applied Pt/C as both cathode and anode catalyst which cause cost inefficiency in manufacturing fuel cell stack.             Anion exchange membrane fuel cell (AEMFC) is being developed to combine advantages of both PEMFC and traditional alkaline fuel cell (AFC). By adopting solid membrane as electrolyte, leakage problem and insoluble salt precipitation could be solved. Furthermore, alkaline condition enhances oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) kinetics which obstructs cell power in PEMFC. However, stability of membrane is still in issue, and hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) kinetics are significantly diminished [1], which leads to higher Pt loading. This research is focusing at slow HOR kinetics and reducing catalyst cost by replacing Pt into non-precious metals such as transition metals.             One of the well-known HOR catalyst for alkaline fuel cell is nickel. Several studies show nickel has catalytic activity of hydrogen oxidation in alkaline media [2,3], but it’s not enough to overcome precious metals such as platinum. Therefore, diverse researches tried to enhance activity of nickel by expanding surface area or doping other elements [4]. However, these catalytic activities were only tested in 6 M KOH, 60~80 ℃ condition, which is identical to real cell operating condition.             NiMo catalyst was synthesized by electrodeposition method which is cost-effective way to produce. Nickel chloride is used for nickel source, and sodium molybdate worked as molybdenum source. Galvanostatic electrodeposition was applied to synthesize NiMo catalyst. Rotating disk electrode (RDE) was used to remove evolved hydrogen efficiently.             HOR activity was measured in hydrogen saturated 0.1 M KOH solution. RDE was used to control diffusion with 1600 rpm speed. Experiment was held at room temperature. To remove capacitive current, steady state polarization method was applied for measuring HOR activity.                            Figure 1 shows HOR current of commercial Pt/C, electrodepositied NiMo, Ni. Adding small amount of Mo in Ni increases HOR current significantly. At overpotential of 20 mV               RHE               , Pt/C shows current density of 1.12 mA/cm               2               , where NiMo has 0.86 mA/cm               2               which is about 77% of Pt/C HOR activity.

The extracted model parameters are compared with those for other forms of platinum electrode, and platinized nickel shows excellent electrocatalytic activity as demonstrated by the exchange current density.  The extracted apparent transfer coefficients for hydrogen evolution and hydrogen oxidation are temperature-dependent, while the apparent Tafel slope of the hydrogen evolution reaction is temperature-independent (approximately 120mV/dec), which is most probably due to two parallel reactions occurring at the interface with different rates and activation energies.

They, however, have been rarely used in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) because of the same reason (               i.e.               moderate               E               M–H               ), which results in poor HER efficiency. In this study, by applying lanthanide contraction and ligand effect, we have successfully lowered the               E               M–H               and substantially boosted the HER activity of Laves intermetallics (RECo               2               and RERu               0.5               Co               1.5               (RE = Pr, Tb, Y and Er)) to outperform those of commercial Pt/C catalyst.

One of them is the carbon support corrosion during fuel cell startup and shutdown (SUSD) cycles [1], for which various mitigations strategies have been considered, based either on system control approaches or materials-based solutions [2, 3, 4]. A promising approach would be the use of a selective anode catalyst, i.e., with high activity for the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) and low activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) [5]. Such a catalyst would eliminate the ORR on the anode electrode during a H               2               /air-front event (i.e., an SUSD event) and thus remove the source for the transient excursions of the cathode electrode to high potentials during SUSD.                                         In this study, we present a promising selective anode catalyst based on iridium. Iridium exhibits not only very high HOR activity (only »3 times lower than Pt [6]), but also has significantly reduced ORR activity compared to Pt. The much lower ORR activity of Ir compared to Pt is shown in Figure 1, where the same noble-metal loading results in a >200 mV lower cell voltage for the ORR on Ir compared to Pt. On the other hand, H               2               -pump experiments showed that the HOR losses for the low-loaded Ir catalyst in Figure 1 only amounted to 14 mV losses at 1.5 A/cm               2               ), in good agreement with theoretical calculated HOR losses [6]. Therefore, Ir shows promise as a possible selective anode catalyst, which might lower SUSD degradation.                                         Figure 1               .

Here, the synthesis of PdO−RuO               2               −C with abundant interfaces/defects was achieved for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR).

A great advantage of this technology is the possibility of replacing PGM catalysts on both anode and cathode and therefore reducing the costs. For example several PGM-free electrocatalysts have demonstrated superior fuel oxidation performance[1]. In AEM electrolysis both Hydrogen [2] and Oxygen Evolution[3] PGM-free catalysts have been demonstrated. In the present work we present unprecedented performance of a Nickel-based Hydrogen Evolution (HER) catalysts that are bifunctional for the Hydrogen Oxidation (HOR) reaction. These Nickel-based catalysts are multifunctional catalytic systems and rely on g alloying and mixed and low-coverage complementary metal oxides to fine tune surface-electrochemical interactions and reactions. While the goal of the work is to create reversible HER/HOR PGM-free catalysts, the efforts to date were focused on making the most active nickel-based bifunctional HER and HOR catalysts. Next reversible electrodes will be developed and catalyst stability under HER/HOR mode switching will be tested. (ARPA-E OPEN 2015 DE-AR0000688)                            A series of nickel-based catalysts were synthesized to create mixed Nickel-alloys and oxides that promote the activation of water and hydroxyl groups on the catalysts. A range of wet-chemical routes was used to produce carbon-supported NiMo, NiCu, and NiMoCu supported on a range of standard and novel Interconnected Mesoporous Carbon™ supports. The materials were characterized through physical parameters such as crystal phase, size, and surface chemistry using XRD, XPS, and Raman Spectroscopy. These materials were evaluated in membrane electrode assemblies [MEAs] using a variety of membranes and ionomers. Unprecedented PGM-free HER performance exceeding 1000 mA/cm               2               @ 1.9V and HOR performance exceeding 300 mA/cm               2               @ 0.65V were achieved.

Ru/WO               2.9               /C displays excellent catalytic activity with mass activity (8.29 A mg               NM               −1               ) and specific activity (1.32 mA cm               NM               −2               ), which are 2.5/3.3 and 21.8/8.3 times that of PtRu/C and Pt/C, respectively. Moreover, Ru/WO               2.9               /C exhibits excellent CO tolerance and operational stability. Experimental and theoretical studies reveal that the improved charge transfer from Ru to WO               2.9               in the metal/metalloid heterostructure significantly tune the electronic structure of Ru sites and optimize the hydrogen binding energy (HBE) of Ru. While, WO               2.9               provides abundant hydroxyl adsorption sites. Therefore, the equilibrium adsorption of hydrogen and hydroxyl at the interface of Ru/WO               2.9               will be realized, and the oxidation of metal Ru would be avoided, thereby achieving excellent HOR activity and durability.","2024-04","2026-01-07 12:32:18","2026-01-07 12:32:18","2026-01-07 12:32:18","2307780","","17","20","","Small","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\Administrator\Zotero\storage\T4Z85TKP\Cheng 等 - 2024 - Optimizing Hydrogen and Hydroxyl Adsorption over RuWO2.9 MetalMetalloid Heterostructure.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These advantages, which are not accessible to acidic proton-exchange membrane fuel cells and water electrolyzers, include the possibility of using stainless steel flow fields and endplates (with the subsequent reduction in costs), more flexibility in the choice of fuels, and the possibility of using cheaper non-platinum-group-metal electrocatalysts for both the hydrogen evolution/oxidation and the oxygen evolution/reduction reactions (1).             However alkaline operation has an important drawback. The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is much more sluggish because of the low concentration of protons in alkaline media and the lower activity of noble metals for this reaction. Pt electrocatalysts show considerable lower HER activity in alkaline conditions than in acidic conditions.             The following mechanism for water electrolysis in alkaline conditions has been proposed:                            a) Volmer: H               2               O+e               -               +* → H               ad               + OH               -                [1]                                         b1) Tafel: H               ad               + H               ad                → H               ad               + 2OH               -               +2* [2]                                         b2) Heyrovsky: H               ad               + H               2               O+e               -               → H               2               + OH               -               + * [3]                           It is generally accepted that the Volmer step is the rate determining step (rds) for the overall reaction. This assumption implies that the presence of a bi-functional catalyst with hydrophilic domains able to stabilize the water in the transition complex will speed up the overall reaction, as observed by several authors for platinum, iridium, ruthenium and nickel electrocatalysts modified by deposition of transition metal hydroxides (i.e. nickel hydroxide) (2, 3).                            In this work, we investigated the HOR/HER kinetics on Pt/C and Pt/C/Ni(OH)               2               bi-functional electrocatalysts. Our objective was to determine the optimum concentration of Ni(OH)               2               required for the best performance of the electrocatalyst for the HER under alkaline conditions. The catalysts were prepared by mixing the required amounts of colloidal dispersions of Ni(OH)               2               with commercial Pt/C catalyst previously dispersed (using ultrasonication) in water. The RDE measurements were done in 0.1M KOH, at temperatures ranging from 0°C to 30°C to extract useful kinetic information such as exchange current densities and activation energies for each catalyst. Kinetic currents were obtained after IR and mass transport corrections. The HOR/HER kinetic current densities (see               Figure 1               ) were fitted using the Butler–Volmer equation to estimate the exchange current densities for each catalyst at each temperature. Arrhenius behavior was observed. The activation energy was the same for all Pt/C and the bi-functional catalysts, at 37.2 kJ/mol, which was in good agreement with previously published value for Pt (4).                                         The highest exchange current densities were obtained for the catalyst containing 10wt% Ni(OH)               2               . Higher Ni(OH)               2               concentrations resulted in a poorer performance due to the coverage of the Pt active sites; a reduction in ECSA was observed.                                         The bi-functional catalysts were also tested in a solid-state alkaline water electrolyzer operated with ultrapure water. The membrane electrode assemblies were fabricated with a commercial anion exchange membrane The anode catalyst was iridium oxide (2.5 mg/cm               2               ). The optimal bi-functional electrocatalyst outperformed Pt/C by 0.1-0.2 V at relevant current densities.

The anion exchange membrane fuel cell (AEM-FC) has been proposed as an alternative in which non-Pt metals may be employed. However, obtaining a high-power density Pt-free AEM-FC has been a challenging task because the Hydrogen Oxidation Reaction (HOR) in the electrocatalysis experiences a slow kinetics at the anode               1–3               . In the present study, with the aim of improving the efficiency of HOR catalysts, various ratios of CeO               x               /Pd catalysts were deposited onto a carbon support using Controlled Surface Reactions (CSR) process. A homogenous distribution of CeO               x               preferentially attached to Pd nanoparticles (NPs) was expected to achieve highly active CeO               x               -Pd/C catalysts for HOR. We present here a comprehensive characterization approach for the synthesized highly active catalyst, and correlate obtained structural/compositional parameters to the performance. The characterization of the catalysts was carried out via Inductively Coupled Plasma-Atomic Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-AES), X-ray Diffraction (XRD), High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HR-TEM), Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) - Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS), Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (EELS), and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) to confirm the bulk composition, phases present, morphology, elemental mapping, local oxidation state and surface chemical states, respectively. The HRTEM images indicated that Pd NPs were uniformly distributed on the carbon support with only some minor agglomeration. Additionally, the achieved high interfacial contact between CeO               x               and Pd acquired on single NPs was, for the first time, segmented and calculated using High-resolution STEM-EDS maps and Image J processing program by measuring the overlap intensities between Pd and Ce NPs; the results clearly showed that CeO               x               NPs were in intimate contact with Pd and their interfacial contact area increased with the addition of CeO               x               , reached a maximum at a ratio 0.38 CeO               x               -Pd/C, then decreased due to the formation of large CeO               x               islands upon the further addition of CeO               x               . The attained interfacial contact area also seems to be much higher than other previously reported Pd-CeO               2               catalysts synthesized by other methods               4–6               , suggesting that the CSR method resulted in a higher selective deposition of CeO               x               on Pd.                                         Moreover, the characterized two strong peaks shape resulting from electron transitions               12               and the intensity ratio               13               of the M               4               to M               5               edge bands of CeO               x               obtained from the highest energy resolution (1.1eV) EELS, suggested that most of the CeO               x               was in the form of CeO               2               and Ce               4+               was predominantly present in CeO               x               . However, the presence of Ce               3+               cannot be ruled out, specially near the surface of the particles               14               . The study also found that the already mentioned interfacial contact area was directly correlated to the electrochemical performance reflected on the HOR activity of the CeO               x               -Pd/C catalysts. From this work, it can be said that when using the CSR method the highest recorded HOR exchange current density, compared to previously reported Pd-CeO               2               catalysts, (51.5 mA mg               –1               Pd               )               4–9               can be achieved. AEMFC performance obtained when using CeO               x               -Pd/C catalyst with Ce/Pd bulk atomic ratio of 0.38 was considerably higher than other cells with analogous HOR catalysts (peak power density of 1169 mW cm               –2               mg               Pd               –1               at 333 K)               4,5,10,11               . This results can be explained by the improved distribution of CeO               x               onto Pd enhancing OH               –               spillover from CeO               x               to Pd, the higher concentration of Pd (IV) sites, and the higher interfacial contact area between CeO               x               and Pd nanoparticles.

A new catalyst for both hydrogen evolution and oxidation, based on a zinc complex, [Zn‐ATSE]               2               , is designed and provided by the reaction of Zn (CH               3               CO               2               )               2               with diacetyl‐2‐(4‐               N               ‐ethyl‐3‐thiosemicarbazone)‐3‐(4‐               N               ‐amino‐3‐thiosemicarbazone) (H               2               ATSE) in our group. Electrochemical investigations show that [Zn‐ATSE]               2               can electro‐catalyze hydrogen evolution from acetic acid with a turnover frequency (TOF) of 64 mol H               2                mol catalyst               −1                h               −1               under an overpotential of 914.6 mV. Moreover, [Zn‐ATSE]               2               also can electro‐catalyze hydrogen oxidation with a TOF of 13.52 s               −1               .

Vacancy engineering is a typical strategy for modulating the catalytic activity of electrocatalysts. However, creating vacancies directly into pure metallic Ru is difficult because of the extremely stringent conditions required and will result in instability because the integrity of the crystal structure is destroyed. In response, a compromise tactic by introducing vacancies in a Ru composite structure is proposed, and vacancy‐rich carbon dots coupled with Ru (Ru@CDs) are elaborately constructed. Specifically, the vacancy‐rich carbon dots (CDs) serve as an excellent platform for anchoring and trapping Ru nanoparticles, thus restraining their agglomeration and growth. As expected, Ru@CDs exhibited excellent catalytic performance with a low overpotential of 30 mV at 10 mA cm               −2               in 1               m               KOH, a small Tafel slope of 22 mV decade               −1               , and robust stability even after 10 000 cycles.

However, it remains a huge challenge to create its inorganic metal-based artificial counterparts. Here, inspired by the formation of biological vesicles, we proposed a novel biomimetic strategy of curling the ultrathin nanosheets into nanovesicles, which was driven by the interfacial strain. Trapped by the interfacial strain between the initially formed substrate Rh layer and subsequently formed RhRu overlayer, the nanosheet begins to deform in order to release a certain amount of strain. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the Ru atoms make the curling of nanosheets more favorable in thermodynamics applications. Owing to the unique vesicular structure, the RhRu nanovesicles/C displays excellent hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) activity and stability, which has been proven by both experiments and DFT calculations. Specifically, the HOR mass activity of RhRu nanovesicles/C are 7.52 A mg(Rh+Ru)−1 at an overpotential of 50 mV at the rotating disk electrode (RDE) level; this is 24.19 times that of commercial Pt/C (0.31 mA mgPt−1).

Detailed experimental results reveal that high concentration of CA retards the growth kinetics and thus leads to the formation of metastable face‐centered cubic (fcc) Ru NAs, while low concentration of CA results in the fast growth kinetics and the preferential formation of Ru NAs with stable hexagonal close packed (hcp) phase.

In this work, single‐atom Co‐N               4               sites are introduced to tailor the interfaces between PtIr alloy clusters and carbonaceous substrates, thereby establishing highly active and stable catalysts toward hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) in alkaline electrolytes and realizing atomically MSIs modulation. The experimental and theoretical results unveil that the formation of robust MSIs at the interfaces with the incorporation of Co single atoms is evidenced by the increased coordination number of Pt‐N/C, which effectively optimizes the adsorption behaviors of H               ad               on Pt/Ir atoms and also tightly immobilizes PtIr clusters on the supports.

This mode of operation depends on the ability to reversibly catalyze hydrogen evolution and oxidation, and ideally using nonprecious catalyst materials. Here we report the synthesis of Ni–Mo catalyst composites supported on oxidized Vulcan carbon (Ni–Mo/oC) and demonstrate the ability to catalyze reversible hydrogen evolution and oxidation. For the hydrogen evolution reaction, we observed mass-specific activities exceeding 80 mA mg               −1               at 100 mV overpotential, and measurements using hydroxide exchange membrane electrode assemblies yielded full cell voltages that were only ∼100 mV larger for Ni–Mo/oC cathodes than for Pt–Ru/C cathodes at current densities exceeding 1 A cm               −2               . For hydrogen oxidation, Ni–Mo/oC films required <50 mV overpotential to achieve half the maximum anodic current density, but activity at larger overpotentials was limited by internal mass transfer and oxidative instability. Nonetheless, estimates of the mass-specific exchange current for Ni–Mo/oC from micropolarization measurements showed its hydrogen evolution/oxidation activity is within 1 order of magnitude of commercial Pt/C. Density functional theory calculations helped shed light on the high activity of Ni–Mo composites, where the addition of Mo leads to surface sites with weaker H-binding energies than pure Ni. These calculations further suggest that increasing the Mo content in the subsurface of the catalyst would result in still higher activity, but oxidative instability remains a significant impediment to high performance for hydrogen oxidation.","2023","2026-01-07 12:28:41","2026-01-08 03:58:12","2026-01-07 12:36:22","1500-1511","","9","2","","Energy Adv.","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\Administrator\Zotero\storage\7V2726DM\Patil 等 - 2023 - Reversible alkaline hydrogen evolution and oxidation reactions using Ni–Mo catalysts supported on ca.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Furthermore, three PtRu               3               /PC nanocatalysts all weaken the hydrogen binding strength relative to the Pt/PC. Remarkably, the Ru‐increased nanocatalyst exhibits up to 38.8‐fold and 9.2‐fold HOR improvement in mass activity and exchange current density, compared with the Pt/PC counterpart, respectively. CO‐stripping voltammetry tests demonstrate the anti‐CO poisoning ability of nanocatalysts, in the sequence of Ru‐increased ≥ PtRu               3               /PC‐300 > Pt‐increased > Pt/PC. From the perspective of engineering a near‐surface structure, this study may open up a new route for the development of high‐efficiency electrocatalysts with a strong electronic effect and oxophilic effect.","2021-02","2026-01-07 12:28:55","2026-01-08 03:58:13","2026-01-07 12:36:59","2006698","","6","17","","Small","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\Administrator\Zotero\storage\XQ627KMG\Zhang 等 - 2021 - Engineering the Near‐Surface of PtRu3 Nanoparticles to Improve Hydrogen Oxidation Activit.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

At present, research in phase engineering of metal materials for electrocatalysis predominantly concentrates on the iron group, platinum group, and coinage group metals with A1‐, A2‐, and A3‐ type structures. However, the investigation of metal phase engineering beyond the above metal group with other types of structures for electrocatalysis is still poorly explored. Herein, using tungsten as a substrate to support iridium, it is shown that iridium‐embedded tungsten with diverse crystal phase structure (referred to as Ir/α‐W for A2‐type structure and Ir/β‐W for A‐15 type structure) exhibits distinct catalytic activity for hydrogen oxidation reactions (HOR) in alkaline medium. Notably, the mass‐normalized exchange current density (j               0, m               ) of noble metal iridium in Ir/α‐W (518.3 A g               −1               Ir               ) is ≈1.8 times and 16.4 times higher than that of Ir/β‐W and Ir/C, respectively. In‐depth mechanistic studies suggest that the enhanced HOR performance on Ir/α‐W is attributed to the enhanced connectivity of the H‐bond network as well as the synergistic optimization of the adsorption binding energies of H and OH intermediate species. This study can inspire more scientific interest on the exploration of metal phase engineering for electrocatalysis.","2025-06","2026-01-07 12:37:03","2026-01-07 12:37:03","2026-01-07 12:37:03","2420633","","24","35","","Adv Funct Materials","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\Administrator\Zotero\storage\M6XA9PMD\Zhao 等 - 2025 - Crystal‐Phase Engineering of Iridium‐Embedded Tungsten for Hydrogen Oxidation Electrocatalysis.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We attribute this remarkable HOR reactivity to an alloy effect that enables optimum adsorption of hydrogen on nickel and hydroxyl on molybdenum (tungsten), which synergistically promotes the Volmer reaction.","2020-09-22","2026-01-07 12:30:11","2026-01-08 03:58:14","2026-01-07 12:37:42","4789","","1","11","","Nat Commun","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\Administrator\Zotero\storage\JR2RWCYV\Duan 等 - 2020 - Bimetallic nickel-molybdenumtungsten nanoalloys for high-efficiency hydrogen oxidation catalysis in.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Herein, a general strategy is proposed to utilize the metalloid properties of supports to trap and stabilize single‐atoms with low‐valence states. A series of single‐atoms supported on the surface of tungsten carbide (M‐WC               x               , M=Ru, Ir, Pd) are rationally developed through a facile pyrolysis method. Benefiting from the metalloid properties of WC               x               , the single‐atoms exhibit weak coordination with surface W and C atoms, resulting in the formation of low‐valence active centers similar to metals. The unique metal‐metal interaction effectively stabilizes the low‐valence single atoms on the WC               x               surface and improves the electronic orbital energy level distribution of the active sites. As expected, the representative Ru‐WC               x               exhibits superior mass activities of 7.84 and 62.52 A mg               Ru               −1               for the hydrogen oxidation and evolution reactions (HOR/HER), respectively.

Here, we break the local symmetry of ultra‐small ruthenium (Ru) nanoparticles by embedding cobalt (Co) single atoms, which results in the release of Ru single atoms from Ru nanoparticles on reduced graphene oxide (Co               1               Ru               1,n               /rGO).

Particularly in recent years, development of new effective separation method is required for the water contaminated by the T. Every day the enormous volume is accumulating in Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant. The water electrolysis, which is the industrially most general separation method, has disadvantage that consume energy is tremendous. To solve this point, we have investigated novel hydrogen isotope separation system named Combined Electrolysis Fuel Cell (CEFC) [1]. In this system, hydrogen and oxygen produced by electrolysis is used for power generation in fuel cell. From this, we can save energy and get further isotope effect by electrochemical reaction in fuel cell. Actually we reported that the D isotope was enriched in water phase by fuel cells with anion or cation conducting polymer [2, 3]. Here, we newly focused on another type of fuel cell, Alkaline Fuel Cell (AFC), and investigated the separation mechanism by several electrochemical methods.                                                                        Experimental                                        The anode was Ru catalyst supported by carbon and the cathode was Pt one. The electrolyte was 30 wt.% KOH solution. Pure H                     2­­                     or D                     2                     gas was supplied to anode and air was did to cathode. The reference electrode was Hg/HgO. Linear sweep amperometry was measured at the scan rate of 20 mA/sec until the cell voltage reached 0.4 V. Simultaneously electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was carried out by frequency analyzer. The frequency range was from 0.1 Hz to 1 x 10                     4                     Hz. The experimental temperature was 50 ºC.                                      3．Results                                        Figure 1 shows the cell voltage-current curves of AFC. The same values of cell voltage at 0 A did not clearly demonstrate that the equilibrium potential of hydrogen oxidation reaction depended on the isotopes. The activation overvoltage, which can be detected as the voltage drop when the current was applied, was about 0.2 V for both gases. On the one hand, the cell voltage decreased linearly until the current reached 1400 mA when H                     2                     gas was used. On the other hand, the voltage of D                     2                     result was remarkably fallen at 1160 mA. The difference of the cell voltage was mainly attributed to the anode potential. This result suggested that the H                     2                     gas transportation in the gas diffusion layer was faster than that of D                     2                     probably. In the meeting, we report the separation factor of the D in a ddition to the EIS results.

Potential pulse technique as well as micropolarization curves with overpotentials of ±10 mV were used in the case of extended nanostructured surfaces to determine the activity. Single Pt particles were investigated in an in situ electrochemical scanning tunneling microscope setup using the STM tip as local sensor. The reactivity obtained on Pt nanostructured Au(111) towards hydrogen reactions were subsidized by single particle reactivity measurements. The specific activity of platinum is enhanced by more than a factor of 1000 as compared to a Pt(111) single crystal.

We investigate the electrochemical behaviour of Pd NPs in the presence of hydrogen over a large range of particle diameters, between 3.8–21.5 nm. The study is carried out in both a three‐electrode setup and a proton pump. A linear relationship between the H/Pd ratios and the NPs diameter is evidenced.

We tested this complex under a wide range of pressures and temperatures, in two different solvents (methanol and water), to determine if simultaneous improvements in rate and overpotential could be achieved. We found that the optimal conditions combined both high temperature (72 °C) and pressure (100 atm H               2               ) in acidic aqueous solution (pH = 1), resulting in the fastest H               2               oxidation reported for any homogeneous electrocatalyst to date (TOF 1.1 × 10               6               s               −1               ) operating at 240 mV overpotential.

MBH is a promising bioelectrocatalyst for bioanode of enzymatic H2–O2 biofuel cells. From the practical viewpoint of electricity production, the H2-depletion near the electrode surface and the oxidative and reversible inactivation called “anaerobic inactivation” of [NiFe]-hydrogenases limit the H2-oxidation at high potentials. We have already proposed a gas-diffusion system to avoid inactivation in our previous study. In this research, we have analyzed the kinetics of the electrochemically induced anaerobic inactivation and the DET bioelectrocatalytic reaction of MBH on electrodes. When the inactivation is considered as a competitive inhibition-like reaction, the maximum value of the apparent Michaelis constant reaches 6.5 mM (at Ketjen Black-modified electrode) as analyzed in our kinetic model. Since the value is larger than the saturated H2-concentration in solution (0.74 mM), we conclude that high-speed H2-supply realized by a gas-diffusion electrode is essential to compete with the inactivation. Furthermore, a gas-diffusion bioanode with MBH can eliminate the H2-depletion near the electrode surface and has reached about 10 mA cm−2 at 0 V (vs. Ag|AgCl|sat.

The Ir‐VN catalyst demonstrates exceptional HOR activity with exchange currents 1.8–4.8 times higher than those of noble metal benchmark catalysts, as well as improved durability and CO tolerance. The unique lattice‐matching effect promotes the directional electron transfer and induces shortened Ir─Ir bonds via the strongly coupled interface, therefore resulting in enhanced anti‐oxidation and anti‐CO capability.

They were shown to be part of a polycistronic operon with other hyp genes. Hydrogenase activity assays of the ΔhypF/hypD mutant showed an almost complete inactivation of the [NiFe]-hydrogenase. Metabolic studies comparing ΔhypF/hypD and wild type (WT) strains in planktonic and sessile conditions indicated the hydrogenase was important for solvent phase metabolism. For the mutant, reabsorption of acetate and butyrate was inhibited during solventogenesis in planktonic cultures, and less ABE was produced. During sessile growth, the ΔhypF/hypD mutant had higher initial acetone: butanol ratios, which is consistent with the inability to obtain reduced cofactors via H2 uptake. In sessile conditions, the ΔhypF/hypD mutant was inhibited in early solventogenesis, but it appeared to remodel its metabolism and produced mainly butanol in late solventogenesis without the uptake of acids. Energy filtered transmission electron microscopy (EFTEM) mapped Pd(II) reduction via [NiFe]-hydrogenase induced H2 oxidation at the extracelluar side of the membrane on WT cells. A decrease of Pd(0) deposits on ΔhypF/hypD comparatively to WT indicates that the [NiFe]-hydrogenase contributed to the Pd(II) reduction. Calculations of reaction potentials during acidogenesis and solventogenesis predict the [NiFe]-hydrogenase can couple NAD+ reduction with membrane transport of electrons. Extracellular oxidation of H2 combined with the potential for electron transport across the membrane indicate that the [NiFe}-hydrogenase contributes to proton motive force maintenance via hydrogen cycling.","2018-07-19","2026-01-07 12:33:59","2026-01-08 03:58:17","2026-01-07 12:40:42","55","","3","4","","Fermentation","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\Administrator\Zotero\storage\57PJC3DY\Germane 等 - 2018 - Hydrogen-Cycling during Solventogenesis in Clostridium acetobutylicum American Type Culture Collecti.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These two steps impose conflicting demands on surface binding strength, making it difficult to optimize both on a single active site. To address this issue, a dual‐site synergistic catalyst is constructed by coupling Ni with a MoBT                                x                              support possessing strong water dissociation ability.

The performance (1000 mA cm               −2               at 1.68 V, 80 °C) and stability (1000 mA cm               −2               , 12 h) of the NiC/NiPt@C electrode were further verified in PEMWE cells, demonstrating its great potential for practical hydrogen production applications.","2025","2026-01-07 12:42:12","2026-01-07 12:42:12","2026-01-07 12:42:12","29070-29078","","35","13","","J.

Among all available electrocatalysts, Ni‐based materials are the only non‐precious‐metal‐based candidates for alkaline hydrogen oxidation, but they generally suffer from low activity. Here, we demonstrate that properly alloying Ni with Mo could significantly promote its electrocatalytic performance. Ni               4               Mo alloy nanoparticles are prepared from the reduction of molybdate‐intercalated Ni(OH)               2               nanosheets. The final product exhibits an apparent hydrogen‐oxidation activity exceeding that of the Pt benchmark and a record‐high mass‐specific kinetic current of 79 A g               −1               at an overpotential of 50 mV. A superior hydrogen‐evolution performance is also measured in alkaline solution. These experimental data are rationalized by our theoretical simulations, which show that alloying Ni with Mo significantly weakens its hydrogen adsorption, improves the hydroxyl adsorption and decreases the reaction barrier for water formation.","2021-03-08","2026-01-07 12:36:54","2026-01-08 03:58:18","2026-01-07 12:42:40","5835-5841","","11","133","","Angewandte Chemie","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\Administrator\Zotero\storage\SMXZ2DYJ\Wang 等 - 2021 - Alloying Nickel with Molybdenum Significantly Accelerates Alkaline Hydrogen Electrocatalysis.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Herein, we develop a facile avenue to design a Pt/Ni(OH)               2               heterojunction on nickel foam (NF) encapsulated by polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) gels with a low Pt content (0.35 wt%).

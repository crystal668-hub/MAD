However, the nascent idea is limited by the energy burden of threshold voltage and the sluggish reaction kinetics involving a six‐electron transfer mechanism. Herein, for the first time, the engineering of electrocatalysts are proposed with simultaneous inclusion of UOR activator and UOR accelerator. Nitrogen‐doped carbon‐decorated Ni‐based Metal Organic Framework (MOF) has been synthesized as the base catalyst material. MoO               2               and rGO with varied loading have been attached to the MOF to get the desired MoO               2               /Ni‐MOF/rGO heterostructure incorporating defects and crystal strain within the materials. Investigations reveal that the invoked lattice strain and atomic defects promote plenteous Ni               3+               active sites. The optimized sample demonstrates extraordinary performance of UOR having the potential value as low as 1.32 V versus RHE to reach the current density of 10 mA cm               −2               and the tafel slope is only 31 mV dec               −1               reflecting very fast reaction kinetics. Here MoO               2               plays the role of UOR activator whereas optimized loading of rGO proliferates the reaction speed. This work, experimentally and theoretically, presents a new insight to enhance electrocatalytic urea oxidation reaction opening an avenue of urea‐based energy‐harvesting technology.","2025-01","2026-01-06 11:49:37","2026-01-08 04:55:10","2026-01-06 11:49:37","2407377","","1","21","","Small","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\Administrator\Zotero\storage\ANZ8MD8M\Acharya 等 - 2025 - Synergistic Inclusion of Reaction Activator and Reaction Accelerator to Ni‐MOF Toward Extra‐Ordinary.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this work, we study Si photoanodes modified with electrodeposited copper‐nickel (CuNi) alloy for OER and UOR. The optimized photoanodes exhibit a low onset potential of 1.15 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and a current density of 6 mA cm               −2               at 1.23 V vs RHE (the thermodynamic potential for water oxidation) for OER. Further, CuNi alloy‐modified photoanodes can drive the UOR at a lower onset potential (1.05 V vs RHE) and generate a higher current density of 31 mA cm               −2               at 1.23 V vs RHE. Importantly, the CuNi alloy can extend the stability for UOR under PEC conditions when compared to a planar Ni film deposited by a vacuum‐based process.

Urea is abundantly present in agricultural waste and in industrial and human wastewater. Besides generating hydrogen, this reaction provides a pathway to eliminate urea, which is a hazard in the environment and to people’s health. In this study, nanosheets of CuCo2O4 grown on nickel foam were synthesized as an electrocatalyst for urea oxidation to generate hydrogen as a green fuel. The synthesized electrocatalyst was characterized using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The electroactivity of CuCo2O4 towards the oxidation of urea in alkaline solution was evaluated using electrochemical measurements. Nanosheets of CuCo2O4 grown on nickel foam required the potential of 1.36 V in 1 M KOH with 0.33 M urea to deliver a current density of 10 mA/cm2.

In this study, nickel foam-supported Ce-doped transition metal phosphide (               i.e.               , Ce-NiP                                x                              /NF) was synthesized using a one-step electrochemical deposition method. The Lewis acidity of the Ce species offered adsorption sites for oxygen-containing substrates, and the electronic structure of Ni could be effectively adjusted due to its variable valence state. In addition, the charge modulation of Ce and P promoted the rapid valorization of Ni, and the escape of P during the reaction formed many oxygen vacancies, which facilitated the adsorption of HMF. The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) required overpotentials of only 116 mV and 276 mV for a current density of 10 mA cm               −2               , respectively.

The ability to use urea reaction of oxidation (UOR) in place of the oxygen/hydrogen evolution process (OER/HER) during water splitting is a significant step toward the production of high‐purity hydrogen with less energy usage. Empirical evidence suggests that the UOR process consists of two stages. First, the metal sites undergo an electrochemical pre‐oxidation reaction, and then the urea molecules on the high‐valence metal sites are chemically oxidized. Here, the use of scandium‐doped CoTe supported on carbon nanotubes called Sc@CoTe/CNT is reported and CoTe/CNT as a composite to efficiently promote hydrogen generation from highly durable and active electrocatalysts for the OER/UOR/HER in urea and alkali solutions. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy indicates that the UOR facilitates charge transfer across the interface. Furthermore, the Sc@CoTe/CNT nanocatalyst has high performance in KOH and KOH‐containing urea solutions as demonstrated by the HER, OER, and UOR (215 mV, 1.59, and 1.31 V, respectively, at 10 mA cm               −2               in 1                m               KOH) and CoTe/CNT shows 195 mV, 1.61 and 1.3 V, respectively.

However, their depletion and role in the development of greenhouse gases, which contribute to global warming and climate change, necessitate the exploration of alternative green energy sources to promote a cleaner environment. Hydrogen, in particular, has emerged as a promising renewable energy fuel for the future. One promising method for producing hydrogen is urea-assisted water splitting, which has the potential to improve both hydrogen production productivity and energy conversion efficiency. However, urea oxidation reaction (UOR) is a complex six-electron transfer process with slow reaction kinetics and unclear mechanisms, which requires a high overpotential. This has led to the need to enhance electrocatalytic reactions. In general, the majority of research has been directed towards the synthesis of robust, efficient, and economically viable catalysts. In recent years, light irradiation has been introduced into an electrochemical system with the aim of enhancing the activities of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and carbon dioxide reduction reaction. Insights into the mechanism demonstrate that external excitation effectively accelerates charge and mass transfer and thus improves the reaction kinetics and thermodynamics. In contrast to previous catalyst modifications, the external field assistance approach allows for greater flexibility in engineering an electrochemical process with facile, continuous, reversible, dynamic, and universal control. However, the utilization of photothermal-assisted urea oxidation reaction has not been reported yet.                            In this research, we report a CuS/WO               3               composite electrocatalyst with a direct Z-scheme system for photothermally-assisted UOR. Upon irradiation with light, the CuS/WO               3               electrode exhibited a reduced overpotential of 308.2 mV, resulting in a UOR current density of 50 mA cm               -2               . Additionally, the CuS/WO               3               electrode achieved a current density of 10 mA cm-2 at a potential of 1.38 V vs. RHE under irradiation. The catalytic activity of the CuS/WO               3               electrode was found to be significantly enhanced, exhibiting a 2.5- and 2.8-fold increase compared to that of CuS and WO               3               , respectively. This enhancement can be attributed to the enhanced redox abilities of charge carriers in the direct Z-scheme system.

By replacing OER with an easier urea oxidation reaction (UOR), developing an HER/UOR coupling electrolysis system for hydrogen production could save a significant amount of energy and money. An Al-doped cobalt ferrocyanide (Al-Co2Fe(CN)6) nanocube array was in situ grown on nickel foam (Al-Co2Fe(CN)6/NF). Due to the unique nanocube array structure and regulated electronic structure of Al-Co2Fe(CN)6, the as-prepared Al-Co2Fe(CN)6/NF electrode exhibited outstanding catalytic activities and long-term stability to both UOR and HER. The Al-Co2Fe(CN)6/NF electrode needed potentials of 0.169 V and 1.118 V (vs. a reversible hydrogen electrode) to drive 10 mA cm−2 for HER and UOR, respectively, in alkaline conditions. Applying the Al-Co2Fe(CN)6/NF to a whole-urea electrolysis system, 10 mA cm−2 was achieved at a cell voltage of 1.357 V, which saved 11.2% electricity energy compared to that of traditional water splitting. Density functional theory calculations demonstrated that the boosted UOR activity comes from Co sites with Al-doped electronic environments. This promoted and balanced the adsorption/desorption of the main intermediates in the UOR process.

Inspired by the “for” loop function in computer programming, this work proposes a dynamic active site strategy to modulate “self‐adaptive” adsorption of OH               −               to achieve a continuous urea‐to‐water electrolysis for the first time, with a highly selective switching from UOR to OER. Specifically, MoO               4               2−               ‐doped NiCo‐based layered double hydroxide (NiCo‐LDH‐MO) is developed as the UOR/OER bifunctional catalyst through the hydrothermal doping and electrochemical reconstruction of Prussian blue analogs. With the aid of density functional theory (DFT) calculation and the in situ characterizations, it suggests that OH               −               is preferentially adsorbed on Co sites to generate CoOOH for UOR in the presence of urea, and then self‐adaptively adsorbs on Ni sites to generate NiOOH for OER after the removal of urea. As a result, the reconstructed electrode exhibits remarkably low potentials of 1.27/1.36 V for UOR at 10/100 mA cm               −2               , respectively, and only 347 mV overpotential for OER at 100 mA cm               −2               .

In a PEC device at least one electrode (here the anode) is semiconducting in order to absorb radiation and generate electron/hole (e/h) pairs; holes are injected from the anode to the electrolyte, carrying out water oxidation, while electrons travel to the cathode, performing hydrogen reduction. In this talk we will discuss two distinct semiconductor photoanodes for solar water oxidation.                            TiO               2               nanotube arrays (NTs) made by electrochemical anodization are stable in operation and feature low cost, but the wide bandgap (3.2 eV) limits the photocurrent, and the low mean free path of the charge carriers increases recombination. In order to improve performance we carried out various modifications to the pristine material, including (i) Li intercalation to limit e/h pairs recombination[1], (ii) addition of electrocatalysts to amplify the water oxidation rate[2], (iii) formation of sub-stoichiometric TiO               2-x               by H               2               annealing to enhance oxygen vacancies as active sites, or annealing in gaseous ammonia to implement nitrogen doping, resulting in visible absorption. All these modifications result in a significant increase in the PEC response, showing a sizeable cathodic shift of the photocurrent onset (~ 100 mV) and up to a 5-fold photoresponse increase at 1.23V               RHE               .                                         Gallium Arsenide (GaAs) on the other hand exhibits a direct bandgap of 1.43eV, resulting in efficient photon-to-electron conversion and excellent PEC performance. GaAs however suffers from fast photocorrosion in aqueous media, leading to semiconductor dissolution or oxidation. Electrodeposition of a thin Ni layer on GaAs using a chemistry that leads to self-terminating growth and affords continuous coverage at few nm thickness[3] provides a passivating layer through which electrons/holes may tunnel. The effect of Ni films of up to 4.4 nm on n-doped GaAs was studied; the dependence of thickness on the deposition time at 10 s and 60 s was observed via X-ray reflectometry, confirming growth inhibition during deposition. Ni-coated GaAs showed enhanced photocorrosion resistance compared to a bare GaAs substrate, while self-limiting Ni films on GaAs retains a high value of photocurrent (8.5mA cm               -2               at 1.23V vs. RHE) compared to non-self-limited deposited sample (6.5 mA cm               -2               at 1.23V vs. RHE), owed to a full coverage of the Ni layer and high photo-transmissivity due to a low coalescence thickness (~3.5nm).

The calculations showed that               1               can lose two protons and one electron readily to produce [LMn               III               (OH)               2               ]               +               (               2               ), which then undergoes two sequential proton‐coupled electron‐transfer processes to afford [LMn               V               OO]               +               (               4               ). The O−O bond formation can occur through direct coupling of the two oxido ligands or through nucleophilic attack of water. These two mechanisms have similar barriers of approximately 17 kcal mol               −1               . The further oxidation of               4               to generate [LMn               VI               OO]               2+               (               5               ), which enables O−O bond formation, has a much higher barrier. In addition, ligand degradation by C−H activation has a similar barrier to that for the O−O bond formation, and this explains the relatively low turnover number of this catalyst.","2017-03-09","2026-01-06 16:02:28","2026-01-08 04:53:49","2026-01-06 16:02:28","903-911","","5","10","","ChemSusChem","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\Administrator\Zotero\storage\QGQDXFWW\Li 等 - 2017 - Mechanism of Water Oxidation Catalyzed by a Mononuclear Manganese Complex.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Investigations of the composition and structure of the screen‐printed films by X‐ray diffraction, X‐ray absorption spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy confirmed that the material was present as the cubic NiO phase. Comparison of the catalytic activity of the microball films to that of films fabricated by using NiO nanoparticles, under similar experimental conditions, revealed that the microball films outperform nanoparticle films of similar thickness owing to a more porous structure and higher surface area. A thinner, less‐resistive NiO nanoparticle film, however, was found to have higher activity per Ni atom. Anodization in borate buffer significantly improved the activity of all three films. X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy showed that during anodization, a mixed nickel oxyhydroxide phase formed on the surface of all films, which could account for the improved activity. Impedance spectroscopy revealed that surface traps contribute significantly to the resistance of the NiO films. On anodization, the trap state resistance of all films was reduced, which led to significant improvements in activity.

Comparative results were obtained from the same setup where an anode without TiO               2               (OTE/Ni-cyclam) was alternatively inserted in the electrolysis cell. Electrolysis experiments were carried out for 2h by applying 1.0V vs. NHE to the OTE/TiO               2               /Ni-cyclam or OTE/Ni-cyclam anodes, where the urea oxidation was predominantly taking place, while the H               2               was continuously evolved from the Pt cathode. During this period of time, urine mineralization and H               2               production were followed by measuring at the same time: the decrement of the total organic carbon (TOC) in the electrolytic solution and the H               2               evolved from the cell. Our results revealed that the H               2               evolution proceeds on Pt cathode when the mineralization of urea contained in urine achieves efficiencies of 53 and 36% on OTE/TiO               2               /Ni-cyclam and OTE/Ni-cyclam electrodes, respectively. Furthermore, it was also observed that urea electrolysis on the OTE/TiO               2               /Ni-cyclam anodes occurs without interference of parasitic reactions, which could be promoted from other chemical components of the synthetic urine (i.e. chloride ions oxidation for producing hypochlorite ions); thus suggesting that the combination of Ni-cyclam with TiO               2               is essential for inhibiting secondary electron transfer processes. These results demonstrate that the OTE/TiO               2               /Ni-cyclam electrodes could be considered as a promising electrochemical technology for aiding to the treatment of wastewaters containing real human urine, which can be accomplished by H               2               generation.","2016-04-01","2026-01-06 16:04:21","2026-01-08 04:53:48","2026-01-06 16:04:21","1138-1138","","21","MA2016-01","","Meet.

Botte and co-workers reported that nickel electrodes exhibited electrocatalytic activity for urea oxidation in basic aqueous solution.               [1]               However further improvement in stability and activity for catalysts is necessary to achieve practical use. Recently we have reported the facile preparation of metal and alloy nanoparticles in ionic liquids without additional stabilizing agents using metal sputter deposition technique.               [2]               The extremely low vapor pressure of ionic liquids enables the sputter deposition of metal species onto the ionic liquids under reduced pressure. Noble metal nanoparticles of several nanometers in size, such as Au, Pd, and Pt, were successfully prepared by sputtering the corresponding metal targets, while simultaneous sputter deposition of different metals produced alloy nanoparticles such as AuPd and AuPt. Alloy nanoparticles exhibited unique physicochemical properties distinct from those of monometallic counterparts, and their catalytic activities could be modified by the control of chemical composition of nanoparticles. Here we report the preparation of Ru-Ni binary nanoparticles by sequential sputter deposition of Ru and Ni onto ionic liquids followed by heat treatment. Furthermore the electrocatalytic activity of thus-obtained nanoparticles is investigated for urea oxidation in alkaline media.                                         Experimental                                         Ru-Ni binary nanoparticles were synthesized by the sequential sputter deposition of Ru and Ni metals onto ionic liquids of 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafuloroborate using a sputter coater (SC-701HMCII, Sanyu Electron). A portion of acetonitrile solution dispersed with carbon black (CB) particles was mixed with thus-obtained ionic liquids, followed by heat treatment at 300 ˚C for 30 min. Thus-obtained Ru-Ni nanoparticles-immobilized CB particle catalyst (Ru-Ni/CB) were isolated by centrifugation. The Ni/Ru ratio in the catalyst was controlled by changing the amount of Ru sputter-deposited in the ionic liquid. Nanoparticles of Ru and Ni, loaded on CB in a similar manner, were also prepared for comparison. The electrocatalytic activity for urea oxidation was investigated with use of grassy carbon electrodes modified with Ru-Ni/CB catalyst particles in 0.1 mol dm               -3               NaOH aqueous solution containing 0.1 mol dm               -3               urea.                                         Results and discussions                                         TEM observation of Ru-Ni/CB revealed that small Ru-Ni binary nanoparticles with average diameter of 3.9 ± 2.1 nm were densely immobilized on the surface of CB particles without formation of large aggregation as shown in the inset of Fig. 1. The chemical condition of particles loaded on CB was investigated by XPS. Ni/CB showed a single peak of Ni 2p at 856.1 eV attributable to Ni               2+               , indicating that Ni was completely oxidized during preparation procedure of catalyst. In contrast, the Ni 2p signals of Ru-Ni/CB appeared at 854.2 and 860.1 eV, which were assigned to Ni               0               and Ni               3+               , respectively. This suggests that Ni oxidation was partially prevented in Ru-Ni/CB probably due to the electronic interaction between Ni and Ru atoms. Figure 1 shows cyclic voltammograms of Ru-Ni/CB, Ni/CB, and Ru/CB for urea oxidation in 0.1 mol dm               -3               NaOH aqueous solution. As reported previously, Ni/CB exhibited the electrocatalytic activity for urea oxidation, in which anodic current for urea oxidation was increased at the potential more positive than 0.5 V vs Ag/AgCl, though no current was observed for Ru/CB. On the other hand, urea oxidation also occurred with use of Ru-Ni/CB at the potential more positive than 0.5 V vs Ag/AgCl, the intensity being about 2 times larger than that of Ni/CB at a constant potential. These results indicated that the electrocatalytic activity for urea oxidation was higher for Ru-Ni binary particles than pure Ni particles, in spite that Ru particles had no activity. The chemical composition of Ru-Ni/CB catalyst was found to influence the catalytic activity: Volcano-type dependence was observed between Ru content in Ru-Ni/CB and the current density at 0.6 V vs. Ag/AgCl. Consequently, we concluded that electrocatalytic activity for urea oxidation of Ni particles was improved by preparing Ru-Ni binary nanoparticles in which Ru and Ni were probably mixed in atomic or nanometer scales.

Here, we propose a structurally defective strategy to prepare a self-assembled ultrathin nanosheet structure by introducing Ga               3+               ions, and               in situ               growth of NiFeGa-LDH@NF on nickel foam (NF) to improve its OER performance. The incorporation of Ga               3+               reduces the average thickness of the nanosheets from 4–5 nm to 1–2 nm, which significantly increases the catalyst activity surface area, and further optimizes its electronic structure causing a significant decrease in the charge transfer resistance. The optimized NiFeGa-LDH@NF provides a high current density of 100 mA cm               −2               at an overpotential of 258 mV, which is 43 mV lower than that of the pure NiFe-LDH@NF. Moreover, the voltage changes by only 1.3% after 72 h at a constant current density of 50 mA cm               −2               , showing its excellent stability. This work presents a new perspective to increase structural defects by the introduction of transition metal ions and demonstrates the effect on OER performance, providing a new line of thought for the development of higher performance OER electrocatalysts.","2025","2026-01-06 16:04:33","2026-01-06 16:04:33","2026-01-06 16:04:33","16241-16249","","21","13","","J.

However, it is still a challenge to enhance the intrinsic and specific activity of SACs. Herein, we present an approach to fabricate a high surface distribution density of iridium (Ir) SAC on nickel-iron sulfide nanosheet arrays substrate (Ir               1               /NFS), which delivers a high water oxidation activity.

The γ-MnOOH structure and morphology are confirmed by X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The γ-MnOOH material, which contains hydroxyl groups and has an average oxidation state of Mn of three as demonstrated by XPS, exhibits excellent electrocatalytic activity towards urea oxidation reaction () compared to bare nickel foam (NF). Specifically, the overpotential at 10 mA/cm2 for γ-MnOOH is found to be 1.05 V, which is significantly lower than that of the NF (i.e., 1.12 V). Notably, the UOR over γ-MnOOH has a potential that is 180 mV lower than observed during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) using the same electrode. These findings suggest that the γ-MnOOH nanorods could serve as a promising electro-catalyst for UOR in various energy storage and conversion applications.           ,","2024-06-30","2026-01-06 15:58:59","2026-01-06 15:58:59","2026-01-06 15:58:59","105-109","","2","12","","Vietnam j. catal. adsorp.","","","","","","","","","https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\Administrator\Zotero\storage\5ZL2APSS\Minh Tuan Nguyen Dinh 等 - 2024 - The synthesis of γ-MnOOH nanorods as an efficient electrocatalyst for urea oxidation.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

High‐temperature treatment, however, leads to significant loss of active sites. To address this, Fe‐MOFs, FeCo‐MOFs, and FeCo‐MOFs/graphene oxide (GO) composites using a one‐pot hydrothermal method are synthesized and annealed at a low temperature of 300 °C. Characterization reveals that FeCo‐MOFs/GO composites possess unique nanowire structures mixed with a small amount of nanoflakes. It is believed that introducing graphene oxide plays a critical role in forming this structure, because the defects in GO provide numerous nucleation sites for nanowire growth. With high specific surface area and good stability, these nanostructures show a low overpotential of 261.5 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm               −               2               and a Tafel slope of 20.47 mV dec               −1               in 1 mol L               −1               KOH alkaline water electrolysis.

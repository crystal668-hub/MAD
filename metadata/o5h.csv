The oxygen evolution reaction is more energetically demanding and kinetically sluggish and represents the bottleneck for a commercial competitiveness of electrochemical hydrogen production from water. Moreover, oxygen is essentially a waste product of low commercial value since the primary interest is to convert electrical energy into hydrogen as a storable energy carrier. We report on the anodic oxidation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to afford the more valuable product 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) as a suitable alternative to the oxygen evolution reaction. Notably, HMF oxidation is thermodynamically more favorable than water oxidation and hence leads to an overall improved energy efficiency for H               2               production. In addition, contrary to the “waste product O               2               ”, FDCA can be further utilized, e.g., for production of polyethylene 2,5-furandicarboxylate (PEF), a sustainable polymer analog to polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and thus represents a valuable product for the chemical industry with potential large scale use. Various cobalt–metalloid alloys (CoX; X = B, Si, P, Te, As) were investigated as potential catalysts for HMF oxidation. In this series, CoB required 180 mV less overpotential to reach a current density of 55 mA cm               −2               relative to OER with the same electrode. Electrolysis of HMF using a CoB modified nickel foam electrode at 1.45 V vs RHE achieved close to 100% selective conversion of HMF to FDCA at 100% faradaic efficiency.","2018-06-13","2026-01-05 13:17:14","2026-01-08 03:58:01","2026-01-08 03:12:56","1436-1445","","","14","","Beilstein J.

Herein, we report a high efficiency for electrocatalytic conversion of 5-(hydroxymethyl)furfural (HMF) to two biobased monomers by pairing HMF reduction and oxidation reactions in a single electrochemical cell. HMF hydrogenation to 2,5-bis(hydroxymethyl)furan (BHMF) was achieved under mild electrolyte conditions (pH 9.2) over a Ag/C catalyst at the cathode. The selectivity and efficiency for Ag-catalyzed BHMF formation were sensitive to cathode potential, owing to competition from HMF hydrodimerization reactions and hydrogen evolution. Moreover, the carbon support of Ag/C was active for HMF reduction and contributed to undesired dimer formation at strong cathodic potentials. As a result, high BHMF selectivity and efficiency was only achieved within a narrow potential range near –1.3 V. At the anode, HMF oxidation to 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) with ~100% efficiency was achieved under the same conditions by a homogeneous redox mediator, 4-acetamido-TEMPO (ACT), together with an inexpensive carbon felt anode. Furtunately, the insensitive selectivity of ACT-mediated HMF oxidation anode potential allows HMF hydrogenation and oxidation reactions to perform together in a single electrochemical cell, which demonstrates high molar yields of BHMF and FDCA (86% and 96%, respectively) and a combined electron efficiency of 187%, which is nearly two-fold enhancement compared to the unpaired cells. Our recent progress in developing porous Ag electrode materials for electrochemical reduction will also be presented.","2019-09-01","2026-01-08 03:13:48","2026-01-08 03:13:48","2026-01-08 03:13:48","1036-1036","","20","MA2019-02","","Meet.

Owing to the balanced competitive adsorption of HMF and OH               −               , the optimized Ni               3               S               2               /NiO                                x                              ‐15 catalyst exhibited remarkable HMF electrocatalytic oxidation performance, with the current density reaching 366 mA cm               −2               at 1.5 V               RHE               and the Faradaic efficiency of the product, 2,5‐furanedicarboxylic acid, reaching 98%.

Coupling the anodic upgradation reaction with industrially important cathodic reactions such as hydrogen generation would increase the energy efficiency in electrochemical water splitting. Herein, we demonstrate the synthesis of a ternary heterostructure based on Ni                                x                              S                                y                              , MoS               2               , and MoC supported on onion-like carbon for anodic HMF valorization.

The anodic valorization is achieved at 190 mV less positive potential with respect to the oxygen evolution reaction, supporting the strong electrocatalytic effect of the heterostructured catalyst. The availability of a large number of active sites due to abundant heterojunctions favors the facile electron transfer kinetics at a favorable potential. The catalyst is highly stable and reusable to deliver 100% yield even after 8 consecutive cycles without any compromise in the FE. The anodic oxidation of HMF is paired with the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction using a cathode electrocatalyst. An observable negative shift (180 mV) in the cell voltage with respect to the oxygen evolution reaction is achieved with the paired electrocatalytic system, demonstrating the excellent activity of the catalyst.","2023","2026-01-05 13:19:05","2026-01-08 03:58:03","2026-01-08 03:14:55","26242-26251","","47","11","","J.

Nickel-based electrocatalysts are viable options owing to their intrinsic redox properties; yet, HMFOR entails many hydroxide ions (OH               −               ) and multi-electron synergistic catalytic mechanisms in alkaline electrolytes.

A significant challenge in the HMFOR lies in elucidating the interaction mechanisms between the active sites and 5‐hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF). However, the unpredictable reconstruction of active sites during the catalytic process complicates the understanding of these mechanisms. In this study, a novel heterojunction (CoSe               2               @NiSe‐CoSe               2               /NF) is synthesized using a straightforward hydrothermal method combined with classical selenization.

The high activity of the heterojunction primarily arises from interfacial electron redistribution. Specifically, Co modulates the band structure of Ni, with Se serving as the intermediary. This modulation increases the adsorption energy of HMF and reduces the energy barrier of the rate‐determining step in HMFOR.

Manganese‐based materials hold promise for HMF oxidation reactions but suffer from low intrinsic conductivity and sluggish kinetics in the formation of high‐valence Mn active species.

However, their preparation has been limited by several factors, not least the synthesis methodology and the radical difference between the crystal structures of the respective monometallic phosphides, where Ni               2               P adopts a hexagonal structure while CoP exhibits an orthorhombic structure. Indeed, conventional synthesis of supported nanostructured TMPs as electrocatalysts often separates nanoparticles, support and ex situ phosphidation steps, which hinders the tailoring of physical and catalytic properties through particle-support, electronic and geometrical interactions. Furthermore, the electrocatalytic conversion/upgrading of organic matters, where the anode reaction of an electrolyzer, e.g. the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), would be replaced by the electro-oxidation of abundant biomass, enables to reduce the cell voltage and, at the same time, to co-produce important renewable chemicals for the manufacture of biopolymers, detergents, food ingredients, and so on. Indeed, due to the high overpotential required to perform OER, a significant part of the energy needed to reduce H               2               O, CO               2               , N               2               or NO               3               −               to fuels or chemicals is consumed by the accompanying OER during HER, CO               2               , NRR, CO2RR.

Specifically, the oxidation of 5-HMF on Ni               2-x               Co               x               P is driven by the Ni               1-x               Co               x               (OH)               2               /Ni               1-x               Co               x               (OOH) redox center during an indirect oxidation mechanism, wherein the presence of P in the electrocatalytic material regulates the electron transfer capacity. Upon the first proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) step of dehydrogenation of 5-HMF molecules, Ni-based active sites are likely to be occupied by organic adducts, while proton species are transferred to neighboring cobalt and phosphorus active sites.

However, achieving both high selectivity and large current density over wide potential window remains a significant challenge, hindering practical applications. In this study, a Ni/Fe dual metal‐atom catalyst is developed for CO               2               reduction, achieving nearly 100 % CO selectivity across an ultra‐wide potential window of 1.6 V, surpassing state‐of‐the‐art catalysts.

Despite the suitable adsorption energy for HMF due to their partially filled d-band electronic structures, Ni- or Co-based oxides/hydroxides still face challenges in insufficient activity and stability. In this study, a porous heterogeneous nickel cobalt oxide/hydroxide growth on nickel foam (NF), which is defined as NF@NiCo-H/O, was developed via immersion in concentrated alkali solution. Compared with the single-component NiCo oxides, the NF@NiCo-H/O catalyst exhibits a lower application potential of only 1.317 V, 1.395 V, and 1.443 V to achieve current densities of 20, 50, and 100 mA cm−2, respectively, in an alkaline solution containing HMF. Additionally, it demonstrates rapid reaction kinetics with a Tafel slope of 27.6 mV dec−1 and excellent cycling stability. Importantly, the presence of more high-valent Ni3+-O species on the catalyst surface contributes to its exceptional selectivity for 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (86.7%), Faradaic efficiency (93.1%), and conversion rate (94.4%).

Replacing the sluggish water oxidation with a bio‐based upgrading reaction can reduce the overall energy cost and allows for the simultaneous generation of high‐value products at both electrodes. Herein, we developed a membrane‐electrode assembly (MEA)‐based electrolysis system for the conversion of 5‐(hydroxymethyl)furfural (HMF) to bis(hydroxymethyl)furan (BHMF) and 2,5‐furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA). With (2,2,6,6‐tetramethylpiperidin‐1‐yl)oxyl (TEMPO)‐mediated electrochemical oxidation (ECO) of HMF at the anode, the unique zero‐gap configuration enabled a minimal cell voltage of 1.5 V at 10 mA, which was stable during a 24‐hour period of continuous electrolysis, resulting in a combined faradaic efficiency (FE) as high as 139 % to BHMF and FDCA. High FE was also obtained in a pH‐asymmetric mediator‐free configuration, in which the ECO was carried out in 0.1 M KOH with an electrodeposited NiFe oxide catalyst and a bipolar membrane.

For the OER, the iron‐doped nickel foam electrode reaches the industrially relevant current density of 500 mA cm               −               2               at 1.473 ± 0.013               V               RHE               (60 °C) and shows no activity decrease over 140 h. The different effects of iron doping are rationalized using methanol probing and in situ Raman spectroscopy. Furthermore, the intrinsic activity is separated from the number of active sites, and, for the organic oxidation reactions, diffusion limitations are revealed. The authors anticipate that the plasma modified nickel foam will be suitable for various (electro)catalytic processes.","2022-10","2026-01-05 13:20:53","2026-01-08 03:58:10","2026-01-08 03:21:26","2202098","","38","12","","Advanced Energy Materials","In‐Liquid Plasma Modified Nickel Foam","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\Administrator\Zotero\storage\SQJ3LXTC\Hausmann 等 - 2022 - In‐Liquid Plasma Modified Nickel Foam NiOOHNiFeOOH Active Site Multiplication for Electrocatalytic.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thus, precisely adjusting the synergistic adsorption among key reactive species, such as HMF and OH               ads               , on the carefully designed catalyst surface is essential for achieving satisfactory catalytic performance for HMF oxidation to FDCA as it is closely related to the adsorption strength and configuration of the reaction substrates. This kind of regulation will ultimately facilitate the improvement of HMF oxidation performance. In this work, Pt nanoparticles modified CuO nanowires (denoted as Pt/CuO@CF) are constructed for the selective electrooxidation of HMF to FDCA under alkaline conditions. The well‐designed Pt/CuO@CF demonstrates highly impressive catalytic performance across a range of HMF concentrations, ranging from the commonly used concentrations to higher levels typically not explored (10, 25, 50, 75, and 100 m               m               ) with high FE               FDCA               (all above 95%) and outstanding long‐term stability (15 cycles). In situ experimental characterizations confirm that the designed heterogeneous interface between Pt and CuO enhances the enrichment of HMF and OH               ads               species on the catalyst surface. Theoretical calculations reveal the anchored Pt nanoparticles reduce the adsorption barrier for HMF and OH               ads               , thereby promoting the highly selective oxidation of HMF to FDCA.","2025-03","2026-01-05 13:21:01","2026-01-08 03:58:11","2026-01-08 03:21:35","2417684","","10","37","","Advanced Materials","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\Administrator\Zotero\storage\RXB8H6AP\Li 等 - 2025 - Synergistically Enhanced Co‐Adsorption of Reactant and Hydroxyl on Platinum‐Modified Copper Oxide fo.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

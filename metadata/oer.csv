This paper synthesized manganese‐iron Prussian blue (MnFe‐PBA@IF) at room temperature, and hexagonal concave structures w ere prepared using a fast‐reducing matrix. Interestingly, MnFe‐PBA@IF has an amorphous structure favorable to exposing more active surfaces. According to Gibbs free energy calculations on MnFe‐PBA, charge depletion of manganese atoms can greatly enhance the adsorption of electron‐rich oxygen‐containing groups on the surface. Furthermore, the overpotential in 1               m               KOH is 280 mV. Also, it can be used as a supercapacitor with a stable operating voltage range of −0.9–0 V and a specific capacity of 1260 F g               −1               . This work provides new insights into the synthesis of OER catalysts for Prussian blue ferromanganese at room temperature. Non‐gold‐bonded adsorption, highly active metal centers and active surfaces are the underlying reasons for the superior performance of supercapacitors. Therefore, Prussian blue with good energy storage performance and high active surface can be used as multifunctional energy storage and conversion electrodes.","2024-02","2026-01-06 11:06:41","2026-01-08 04:55:12","2026-01-06 11:06:41","2303946","","7","20","","Small","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\Administrator\Zotero\storage\AUJGLN69\Wei 等 - 2024 - Unlocking the Potential of Amorphous Prussian Blue with Highly Active Mn Sites at Room Temperature f.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This was thought to arise as a result of the extended electrochemical active surface area and its superaerophilic properties that facilitates the release of oxygen bubbles               [1]               . Herein, we report on a method to decorate the Ni DHBT electrode with Ir atoms via a galvanic replacement (GR) reaction. The resulting electrode has very low loadings of Ir (0.26 atom % as determined by EDX). As shown in Figure 1, micrometer-sized pores are observed at the surface of deposits, with pore walls exhibiting a highly porous cauliflower-like secondary structure, with much smaller pore diameter (typically less than 500 nm). The structure seen in Figure 1 was observed over the entire 0.32 cm               2               geometric surface area of the deposits. The morphology of the Ir-modified electrode is not changed with respect to Ni DHBT electrode, indicating that the GR reaction is occurring only at the surface of the deposit. Voltammetry cyclic tests in 1M KOH solution showed hydrogen adsorption/desorption (H               upd               ) peaks of Ir as well as the redox peaks of Ni(OH)               2               which suggested the coexistence of Ir and Ni content at electrode/electrolyte interface. The activity for the OER of Ni DHBT electrode was further improved by decoration with Ir, resulting in an overpotential of 195mV at 10 mA/cm               2               and a Tafel slope of 46 mV/dec. To the best of our acknowledgment, this is one of the best performing Ni based OER catalysts reported so far. The interaction of oxygen bubbles with the electrode surface will also be assessed using both optical imaging and acoustic emission characterization.                                         [1] M.

Improving the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is focused to overcome the limit efficiency of water electrolysis. Transition metals, especially Ni, are one of the most promising materials for the alkaline OER because of good catalytic activities, stabilities and cost efficiency. Ni based materials, such as Ni oxyhydroxides, hydroxides, phosphides and sulfides, are intensively developed for use as OER catalysts. Recently, the sulfurization of transition metals is introduced as an effective method to improve the intrinsic electrocatalytic activities. The role of S has been summarized in 2 ways. S accelerates the regeneration of transition metals in alkaline media that S is dissolved and exchanged with O species. Mullins et al. reported Nickel oxide derived from Ni-S. It exhibits amorphous and large active surface morphology which is favorable OER. The other role is that remaining S modulates the electronic structures of Ni catalysts reducing the energy barrier for the OER. Wu et al. developed ultrathin Fe-doped Ni               3               S               2               for overall water splitting. Based on density functional theory calculations, the Fe-doped Ni               3               S               2               surface exhibits an optimized energy for water adsorption and dissociation, which enhances the intrinsic activity for the OER. However,               in-situ/operando               experimental studies regarding the effects of residual S are rare.                                         Herein, we report the role of the remaining S in Ni catalysts that exhibit longer Ni-O bonding in the NiOOH phase produced               in-situ               . C-supported Fe- and Co-doped nickel sulfide catalysts (NiFeCo-S/C) is prepared using a simple impregnation method with heating under an H               2               S atmosphere. We tested the electrochemical properties of the NiFeCo-S/C in alkaline media of 1 M KOH. It achieved current density of 10 mA cm               -2               with only overpotential of 267.2 mV. Also, it maintained the OER activities for 24 h at current densities of 10 and 50 mA cm               -2               , respectively. Moreover, the prepared catalyst was analyzed the change of electronic structure and bonding group using in-situ/operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAFS) and surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) under OER condition. Based on these results, we could elucidate the effects of the remaining S during the OER.

Herein, the unexpected activation of all metal sites in HE Cu–Co–Fe–Ag–Mo (oxy)hydroxides for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is reported, and it is found that metal–oxygen d–p hybridization, as an effective descriptor, can indicate the intrinsic activity of each metal site.

The oxygen evolution reaction catalyst (SiC-C@Fe3O4) prepared by chemical deposition exhibits a low overpotential (260 mV), low Tafel slope (56.93 mV dec−1), high electrochemical active surface area (54.92 mF cm−2), and low Rct value (0.15 Ω) at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 in 1 M KOH electrolyte. The produced natural Si-C composite materials overcome the limitations imposed by the intricate internal structure of silicon-rich biomass. The existence of this stable substrate offers a novel avenue for maximizing the utilization of rice-husk-based carbon, and broadens its application field. At the same time, it also provides a theoretical basis for the use of rice husks in the field of hydrogen production by electrolysis of water, thus promoting their high-value utilization.","2023-08-18","2026-01-07 15:42:24","2026-01-08 04:53:46","2026-01-07 15:42:24","6117","","16","28","","Molecules","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\Administrator\Zotero\storage\2GMZE2K8\Li 等 - 2023 - Effectively Controlled Structures of Si-C Composites from Rice Husk for Oxygen Evolution Catalyst.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the poor stability, high cost of the oxygen electrodes, and especially the sluggish kinetics hinder the large-scale applications of metal-air batteries. To enhance the oxygen reaction rate, the high-efficient catalyst, which can accelerate oxygen evolution reaction (OER: 4OH               -               →O               2               +2H               2               O+4e               -               ) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR: O               2               +2H               2               O+4e               -               →4OH               -               ) is urgently required. Among the oxygen electrode catalysts, perovskite oxides with the general formula ABO               3-δ               , in which A is rare-earth or alkaline earth element and B is transition metal, have received significant attention due to high ionic and electronic conductivity as well as the good stability.                                         In recent years, considerable efforts have been devoted to understanding the catalytic mechanism of ABO               3-δ               perovskite oxides to achieve high efficient OER and ORR. It is widely accepted that the OER and ORR processes involve a sequence of intermediates (OH*, O* and OOH*) on the active atoms, which is intimately related to electronic structure (various electron and orbital distribution) and geometric structure of active atoms. The electronic structure is sensitive to the component, valence state of A and B site and particularly the concentration of oxygen vacancies. The oxygen molecules produced during OER process could fill the oxygen vacancies, which could further supply oxygen loss in ORR process. Therefore, the presence of oxygen vacancies can significantly affect the catalytic activity. Besides the electronic structure, the geometric structure of active atom can directly affect the band length and band angle of active atom-intermediates, which could modify the adsorption energy of intermediates. Therefore, the optimization of electron structure and geometric structure plays crucial role in achieving the enhanced electrocatalytic activity of perovskite oxides.                                         Following this strategy, in this work, cerium (Ce) ions are successfully doped into LaCoO               3-δ               , causing the improved catalytic activity by modifying the electronic and geometric structures. The cerium oxides with co-existed +3 and +4 valence state are capable in storing and releasing oxygen (“oxygen self-breathing”) into LaCoO               3-δ               , which is beneficial to improve the electrocatalytic activity. The XPS analysis of Ce 3d shows the characteristic peaks due to the coexistence of Ce               3+               and Ce               4+               ions (Figure 1a), confirming the doping of Ce ions in LaCoO               3-δ               . To further verify the introduction of oxygen vacancies in LaCoO               3-δ               , the O 1s core-level spectrum is shown in Figure 1b. As can be seen, the peak at 528.5 eV corresponds to the lattice oxygen species (O               2-               ). Notably, Ce-doped LaCoO               3-               δ               (La               0.9               Ce               0.1               CoO               3-δ               )                              catalyst possesses the higher O               2-               percentage than that of LaCoO               3-δ               . The electrocatalytic characteristics of the perovskite oxides have been systematically investigated with RDE system in the O               2               -saturated 0.1 M KOH solution. The La               0.9               Ce               0.1               CoO               3-δ               shows the enhanced ORR and OER activities in comparison with LaCoO               3-δ               . As shown in Figure 1(c), the La               0.9               Ce               0.1               CoO               3-δ               shows better ORR performance with the half-wave potential (0.677V) at -3 mA cm               -2               and the onset potential (0.835V) at -2 mA cm               -2               . Meanwhile, La               0.9               Ce               0.1               CoO               3-δ               catalyst also displays better OER performance (Figure 1(d)). Compared with LaCoO               3-δ               catalyst, the over-potential of La               0.9               Ce               0.1               CoO               3-δ               catalyst shifts negatively by 76.8 mV at 10 mA cm               -2               .

Among the iron‐based perovskite oxides (AFeO               3               ), LaFeO               3               stands out as a preferred catalyst for electrocatalytic OER due to its exceptional selectivity in oxygen bonding at the A‐site. The introduction of A‐site substitution and controlled morphological engineering in perovskite structures has proven effective in enhancing the electrical conductivity and intrinsic catalytic activity. Nevertheless, the conventional A‐site substitution approach often involves prolonged high‐temperature calcination, leading to the agglomeration of nanostructures, particularly in two‐dimensional (2D) porous configurations.

This microwave technique capitalizes on the benefits of transient heating and cooling, enabling simultaneous construction of 2D porous morphology and precise regulation of Sr substitution in one step.

Despite substantial efforts having been devoted to tuning the oxygen vacancy concentration in perovskite oxides, the impact of the concomitant altering of oxygen vacancy ordering is often underestimated. In particular, the underlying mechanism of how the ordering and the concentration of oxygen vacancy affect the lattice OER, and how to well balance them still remain inadequately understood.

In hydrometallurgical processes, zinc electrowinning from sulfate-based electrolytes is the last step of zinc extraction in which high purity metallic zinc is electrodeposited from a highly acidic solution on an aluminum cathode. The electrowinning stage is very energy-intensive and responsible for approximately 80% of the power requirement of a zinc refinery (1). Thus, improving the energy efficiency and lowering the operating costs of zinc electrowinning are of primary significance. The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) overpotential on conventional lead-silver (Pb-Ag) anodes contributes to nearly 25% of the total electrowinning cell potential (2). Therefore, the high anodic OER overpotential places a heavy financial burden on zinc refining plants.                            The present study aims to evaluate novel anodic electrocatalysts incorporating MnO                                x                              in order to lower the anodic OER overpotential of the zinc electrowinning process. Anodically electrodeposited MnO                                x                              catalysts on Pb-Ag electrodes were prepared using galvanostatic and potentiodynamic polarizations. The OER catalytic activity and stability of MnO               x               electrodeposited Pb-Ag electrodes were evaluated in 160 g/L sulphuric acid solution with 3 g/L of manganese (II) and in the absence and presence of 0.3 g/L of chloride ion at 35°C, using a standard three-electrode setup. The electrolyte composition and operating conditions were selected such that to be directly applicable to the industrial zinc electrowinning process. The OER activity of the MnO               x               electrodeposited electrodes was investigated through potentiodynamic polarization and 72-hour galvanostatic electrolysis at 50 mA/cm               2               superficial current density. Finally, the activity of MnO               x               electrodeposited Pb-Ag electrodes was explored in a full zinc electrowinning cell through 24-hour galvanostatic electrolysis at 50 mA/cm               2               superficial current density.                                         The OER potential variations of the bare Pb-Ag and MnO                                x                              electrodeposited Pb-Ag anodes during the 72-hour galvanostatic polarization are shown in Fig. 1. In the absence and presence of chloride ions, the three MnO                                x                              electrodeposited Pb-Ag electrodes are observed to reduce the anodic potential by maximum of 150 mV and 90 mV, respectively. Investigation of these novel electrodes in the full-cell zinc electrowinning operation corroborated the half-cell experiments, revealing a maximum of 80 mV reduction in cell potential at 50 mA/cm               2               superficial current density and in the presence of 0.3 g/L of chloride ion.

The spinel structure of ternary transition metal sulfides (TTSs) has gained lots of attention due to their noteworthy electrochemical properties, such as electrical conductivity, surface flexibility, thermal stability, and catalytic activity. The morphologies of nanostructures are critically important for several reasons, as they directly influence the physical, chemical, mechanical, and catalytic properties of the material. Even though the spinel structure intrinsically has a unique framework and specific arrangement of metal ions, which enhances the catalytic performance. This review focuses on the morphology and electrocatalytic activity of recently reported TTS electrocatalysts for OER. Two‐dimensional materials resulted in excellent OER performance due to their improved surface area and catalytically active sites. For example, a recent study reported that the NiCo               2               S               4               /ZnS nanosheets exhibited a low overpotential of 140 mV at 10 mA cm               −2               with a small Tafel slope of 47 mV dec               −1               , highlighting their potential for efficient and stable OER applications. In addition, the heterostructure TTS composite shows greater catalytic activity because it produces interfaces to enhance the OER efficiency.

In this study, screen‐printed electrodes containing ZIF‐67—a zirconium‐based metal–organic framework (Zr‐MOF) composed of trimesic acid, carbon quantum dots (CQDs), and graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs)—were created using a layer‐by‐layer modification process. Increased number of active sites, increased surface area, and improved electron transport were demonstrated in structural and electrochemical testing of hybrid electrocatalyst systems. In comparison to reported electrodes, the ZIF/MOF/GNP‐modified screen‐printed carbon electrode (SPCE) performed significantly better at OER, with a reduced overpotential of 280 mV at 10 mA cm               −2               and a Tafel slope of 40 mV dec               −1               . Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) confirms a significant reduction in charge transfer resistance due to the improved interfacial conductivity. After 18 h of operation, the system displayed excellent performance with little drift, according to chromatopotentiometry testing. Because the MOF framework was made more conductive by the combined effects of conductive GNPs and CQDs, EIS revealed a reduction in charge transfer resistance. These findings suggest that a hybrid system consisting of ZIF, MOF, and GNP might be an effective electrocatalyst for cost‐effective, scalable, and environmentally friendly water splitting applications.

The trace Zn dopants are introduced in advance by a facile and one‐step hydrothermal method, followed by leaching over the electrochemical activation process, which can remarkably reduce the formation potential of NiFeOOH active centers to enable the deeper self‐reconstruction for the formation of abundant highly active centers.

These nanostructures are easily achievable and convenient to prepare using template assisted assembling of building units. Bicontinuous microemulsions were used in this work as soft templates because of its facile preparation and unique disposition made up of continuous intertwined channels, leading to interconnected 3D nanostructures of Pt-Co               3               O               4               in a simple chemical reduction process.

The crystalline nature of the synthesized Pt nanostructures was confirmed by the XRD patterns. The XPS spectra confirmed the presence of cobalt oxides and metallic Pt               0               . From the SEM images, both Pt-Co               3               O               4               and Pt showed interconnected needle-like structure. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements showed the characteristic features of polycrystalline Pt electrode, whereas the same features were not as pronounced in Pt-Co               3               O               4               nanostructure.

The electrochemical measurements in 0.1 M KOH at a scan rate of 1 mV s               -1               gave an onset potential of approximately 1.43 V vs RHE for Pt-Co               3               O               4               , 100 mV lower than Pt which has an onset potential of 1.53 V vs RHE. An early onset potential is an indication for a good OER catalytic activity [2]. The glassy carbon electrode (GCE) showed no catalytic activity. The overpotential at the current density of 10 mA cm               –2               (η               10               ) measured for Pt-Co               3               O               4               nanostructure is 222.6 mV vs RHE.

The OER performance obtained in this work is comparable superior to Pt supported on Ti [3].

Nevertheless, traditional synthetic methods, including calcination and solvothermal, of the electrocatalysts are high‐cost, low‐yield, and energy‐hogging, which limits their industrial application. Herein, an ambient fast synthetic method is developed to prepare terrace‐like Fe/Co bimetal‐organic framework (TFC‐MOF) electrocatalyst materials in gram scale in 1 h. The method in this paper is designable based on coordination chemistry. Fe and Co ions can coordinate with the carboxyl groups on benzene‐1,3,5‐tricarboxylic acid (H               3               BTC) to form a 2D‐MOF structure. Structural characterizations, including SEM, TEM, and XRD are conducted to verify that the TFC‐MOF is a terrace‐like layered structure with uniform‐sized mesoporous, which reduces the adsorption steric hindrance and facilitates the mass and electron transfer efficiency of OER. The TFC‐MOF shows low overpotential, 255 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm               −2               , and a low Tafel slope of 49.9 mV dec               −1               , in an alkaline solution.

The development of high‐performance catalysts has been facing the major hurdles of the sluggish activity in alkaline solution and requesting high energy to stabilize the nanoparticles on their supports, challenging the pH‐universality and the applicability of the supported metallic nanoparticles.

This study proposes a feasible ligand modulation strategy to boost the OER catalytic activity of cobalt‐iron oxyhydroxide ((Fe,Co)OOH). The 2‐methylimidazole (MI) ligand coordination on (Fe,Co)OOH reduces the orbital overlap between the Fe/Co 3d and O 2p, which weakens the adsorption to oxygen‐containing intermediates and thus facilitates the unfavorable O               2               desorption.

CeO2-Ir/CNTs demonstrate remarkable effectiveness as catalysts for acidic OER, achieving 10.0 mA cm−2 at a low overpotential of only 262.9 mV and maintaining stability over 60.0 h.

Recently, experimental studies have shown that the aggregation of metal atoms into small clusters or particles is inevitable during the high temperature pyrolysis, while the influences of metal clusters on the OER activity of single metal atoms in M–N–C are unclear. Herein, taking Ni-based single atom as examples, the interaction characters of NiN               4               doped graphene (NiN               4               -graphene) with different Ni clusters were studied. The modulation effects of Ni clusters to the NiN               4               -graphene were systematically investigated from the geometric configurations, electronic structures, and the OER activity of the Ni single atom. It was found that the OER performance of NiN               4               -graphene can be remarkably improved through the addition of Ni clusters, and the lowest overpotential of 0.43 V is achieved on NiN               4               -graphene with the modification of Ni               13               cluster, which is smaller than that of 0.69 V on NiN               4               -graphene. Electronic properties calculations showed that the charge transfer from Ni clusters to NiN               4               -graphene will alter the density of states of Ni single atom near the Fermi level, which promotes the charge transfer from NiN               4               -graphene to oxygen containing products and optimizes the adsorption strength of oxygen intermediate to close to the ideal adsorption free energy of 2.46 eV by enhancing the hybridization interaction between the O-p orbitals and the Ni-                                d                 xz                              , Ni-                                d                 yz                              orbitals, and finally leading to an enhanced OER activity.

Challenges persist, however, in modulating entropy and understanding the dynamic reconfiguration of high‐entropy sulfides during OER. In this study, an innovative in situ corrosion method is introduced to convert low‐valent nickel on a nickel foam substrate into high‐entropy heazlewoodite (HES/NF), significantly boosting OER performance. By synthesizing a series of low‐, medium‐, and high‐entropy heazlewoodites, the intrinsic factors influence catalyst surface evolution and electrocatalytic activity is systematically explored. Employing a combination of in situ and ex situ characterization techniques, it is observed that HES/NF dynamically transforms into a stable hydroxide oxide (MOOH)‐sulfide composite under OER conditions. This transition, coupled with lattice distortion, optimizes the electrostatic potential distribution, ensuring superior catalytic activity and preventing surface sulfide deactivation through the formation of stable HES‐MOOH species. This synergy enables HES/NF to achieve remarkably low overpotentials: 172.0 mV at 100.0 mA cm               −2               and 229.0 mV at an extreme current density of 300.0 mA cm               −2               .

The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) results showed that the dual-substitution of Fe and Ni atoms not only produced higher valence Co               3+               ions but also generated the more active species Fe               3+               . In addition, the produced metal oxyhydroxides (MOOH, M = Co, Fe, Ni) on the catalyst surface during OER activation could contribute both excellent catalytic activity and ultralong stability.","2023","2026-01-07 15:52:15","2026-01-08 04:53:29","2026-01-07 15:52:15","804-814","","3","10","","Inorg.

The limited availability of traditional fossil fuel demands renewable energy resources. The electrochemical oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reaction are the key processes in energy conversion and storage devices like metal-air batteries. The development of rechargeable metal-air batteries requires efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Traditionally, Pt-, Ru- and Ir-based materials have been used for ORR and OER.               1               The large overpotential due to the slow electron transfer kinetics, high cost and the electrochemical instability of these traditional precious metal-based electrocatalysts demands for active non-precious bifunctional catalysts. Moreover, the use of these traditional catalysts as an oxygen electrode is limited as they are not able to catalyse both the ORR and OER simultaneously. In the recent past, the oxides of transition metals such as Co, Mn, etc. including mixed valence spinel and perovskites have been proposed as alternate catalyst for these reactions.               2               However, the poor electronic conductivity and the recyclability of these oxides limits their potential application.               3               Recently, the hybrid electrocatalyst based on carbon and transition metal catalyst is emergingfor ORR and OER reactions.               4                                         Our group is interested in the development of new functional materials for fuel cell and supercapacitor applications.               2a,5               In continuation of our earlier efforts, herein we demonstrate the synthesis of two types of low-cost transition metal (Co, Fe) based hybrid bifunctional electrocatalyst. The two catalysts cobalt and nitrogen dual-doped carbon (Co-N-C) and reduced graphene oxide-CoFe (rGO-CoFe) were synthesized by chemical method followed by thermal annealing at an optimized temperature. The Co-N-C catalyst was obtained from cobalt tetra-aza macrocycle (Co-TET-A) whereas the rGO-CoFe catalyst was synthesized from multimetal complex, cobalt hexacyanoferrate. Both the catalysts were characterized by analytical techniques including XPS, TEM and XRD. The electrocatalytic response towards ORR and OER was evaluated by hydrodynamic voltammetry. The Co-N-C and rGO-CoFe catalysts show the limiting current density of -4.37 mA/cm               2               and -5.58 mA/cm               2               , respectively and both the catalysts promote the 4-electron pathway for the reduction of oxygen. The OER activity was evaluated by measuring the overpotential at which 10 mA/cm               2               current density was observed. Interestingly both Co-N-C and rGO-CoFe catalysts show the benchmark current density of 10 mA/cm               2               at a low overpotential of 0.28 V and 0.22 V, respectively. The overall oxygen electrode activities were evaluated by calculating the difference in potential (ΔE) between the OER current density at 10 mA/cm               2               and the ORR current density at −3 mA/cm               2               . We could achieve a ΔE of 0.92 V and 0.82 V on Co-N-C and rGO-CoFe catalyst respectively, confirming the efficient bifunctional activity of these catalysts. It is demonstrated that the synergistic effect between the metal and carbon and the porous nature of the catalysts plays an important role in the bifunctional activity. The detailed synthetic and bifunctional activity will be discussed.                                                                                   References:                                         1 (a) S.

The stoichiometry of TMOCs can be adjusted, which enables control of their optical bandgaps and tunability of electrical conductivity by more than eight orders of magnitude. By tuning the chalcogen-to-oxygen ratio along with local atomic structure in TMOCs, it is possible to impart unexpected properties. For example, in contrast to conventional TMDs, the hybrid structure of TMOCs renders them surprisingly stable and electrochemically active in strong acids, allowing them to be used as proof-of-concept catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction at pH ≈ 0.

Nevertheless, efficient and straightforward methodologies to obtain superior and stable electrodes need to be implemented to approach this technology to real applications. Recently, self-supported catalysis emerged as a promising solution. However, catalyst design is still limited by the low chemical tunability and elevated preparation times and costs. Herein, a solution combustion (SC) methodology is described to produce designed self-supported electrocatalysts that excel in the OER and mitigate previous limitations. M-doped NiO-based electrocatalysts (with M = Fe, Co, Mn, and Zn) were self-supported by the SC method on nickel foam, and overperformed analogous benchmarked catalysts prepared by other methods. Notably, in Fe-doped NiO, the overpotential required to drive the OER at 10 mA cm               −2               was found to be 190 mV, the lowest reported so far for metal oxide electrocatalysts at pH 13.

Herein, by means of computational screening based on the density functional theory (DFT), we studied a wide range of transition metal (TM) atoms embedded into the double carbon vacancy of C               3               N monolayers (V               CC               ), denoted as TM-V               CC               (TM = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ir and Pt), as efficient single-atom catalysts (SACs) for OER and ORR.

In this work, we have systematically investigated a series of potentially efficient and stable single late transition metal atom doped phthalocyanines (TM@Pcs, TM = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ir and Pt) as single-atom catalysts (SACs) for applications toward the OER and ORR through a computational screening approach. Our calculations indicate that TM atoms can tightly bind with Pc monolayers with high diffusion energy barriers to prevent the isolated atoms from clustering. The interaction strength between intermediates and TM@Pc governs the catalytic activities for the OER and ORR. Among all the considered TM@Pc catalysts, Ir@Pc and Rh@Pc were found to be efficient OER electrocatalysts with overpotentials               η               OER               of 0.41 and 0.44 V, respectively, and for the ORR, Rh@Pc exhibits the lowest overpotential               η               ORR               of 0.44 V followed by Ir@Pc (0.55 V), suggesting that Rh@Pc is an efficient bifunctional catalyst for both the OER and ORR. Moreover, it is worth noting that the Rh@Pc catalyst can remain stable against dissolution under the pH = 0 condition.               Ab initio               molecular dynamic calculations suggest that Rh@Pc could remain stable at 300 K. Our findings highlight a novel family of two-dimensional (2D) materials as efficient and stable SACs and offer a new strategy for catalyst design.","2020","2026-01-07 03:07:29","2026-01-07 03:07:29","2026-01-07 03:07:29","710-716","","2","2","","Nanoscale Adv.","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\Administrator\Zotero\storage\CFTUVPAK\Zhou 等 - 2020 - Computational screening of transition metal-doped phthalocyanine monolayers for oxygen evolution and.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Stainless steel electrodes for water electrolysis have received attention lately, showing  that they can be a low-cost substrate for water electrolysis. Coating stainless steel with low-cost electrocatalysts can prove beneficial to lower overpotential for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), thereby reducing the overall energy consumption of water electrolysis at an affordable cost.

Post OER characterization indicates that the main active phase of the Co               2               –NiMoO               4               -HNS catalysts toward the OER are amorphous Ni               3+               , Co               3+               , and H–O and the high-valent Mo (+6) can make nickel and cobalt better maintain Ni               3+               and Co               3+               sites. Remarkably, this hierarchical hollow Co               2               –NiMoO               4               -HNS catalyst exhibits a favorable catalytic performance toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with a receivable overpotential of 270 mV achieving a current density of 10 mA cm               −2               and a Tafel slope of 65 mV dec               −1               .

Accordingly, enhancing catalytic activity and stability of the anode catalyst (IrO               2               ), which constitutes a significant portion of the cost of PEMWE, is crucial for its practical commercialization. Notably, recent research has shed light on the pivotal role of Ir-O bond distance in IrO               2               -based electrocatatlysts, where doping or composite formation with foreign atoms influences oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity and stability. Therefore, understanding these Ir-O bond distance is crucial to effectively manipulate the OER activity and stability. Herein, we developed a hybrid-phase of Ti-added IrO               2               electrocatalyst, demonstrating remarkable OER activity of 233.5 mV at 10 mA/cm               2               and stability for over 25 h through fundamental insights into asymmetric interatomic interactions induced by Ti adoption. Our findings reveal that optimizing the multi-phase evolution by introducing Ti into IrO               2               yields compressive strains in IrO               2               motifs reducing the Ir-O bond distance effectively increase the OER activity.

These advancements represent a breakthrough in enhancing the OER activity and stability of IrO               2               , marking a significant milestone in advancing transformative energy shifts toward sustainable and environmentally integral renewable sources.","2024-11-22","2026-01-07 02:47:00","2026-01-08 04:55:35","2026-01-07 02:47:00","2841-2841","","42","MA2024-02","","Meet.

Researchers always prefer to composite TMSs with other functional materials to make up for their deficiency, but rarely focus on the effect of intrinsic structure adjustment on their catalytic activity, especially anion structure regulation. Herein, applying the method of interference hydrolysis and vacancy reserve, new silicate vacancies (anionic regulation) are introduced in cobalt silicate hydroxide (CoSi), named SV‐CoSi, to enlarge the number and enhance the activity of catalytic sites. The overpotential of SV‐CoSi declines to 301 mV at 10 mA cm               −2               compared to 438 mV of CoSi. Source of such improvement is verified to be not only the increase of active sites, but also the positive effect on the intrinsic activity due to the enhancement of cobalt‐oxygen covalence with the variation of anion structure by density functional theory (DFT) method. This work demonstrates that the feasible intrinsic anion structure regulation can improve OER performance of TMSs and provides an effective idea for the development of non‐noble metal catalyst for OER.","2024-05-06","2026-01-07 02:47:23","2026-01-08 04:55:35","2026-01-07 02:47:23","2401394","","","","","Small","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\Administrator\Zotero\storage\PTMLXGJ8\Wang 等 - 2024 - Anion Structure Regulation of Cobalt Silicate Hydroxide Endowing Boosted Oxygen Evolution Reaction.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, while SACs with various coordination environment have become experimentally feasible, knowledge about the structure‐performance relationship of SACs is still very limited, especially for the emerging multiple               p               ‐block element‐doped SACs substrates.

Through spin‐polarized density functional theory calculations with van der Waals corrections, 52 stable single‐atom iron catalysts were identified. To analyze their OER performance, an OER volcano activity model was derived to predict their performance as the function of O* and HO* binding free energies.

Here FeMn@CoNi core–shell PBAs are employed as precursors, together with Se powders, in low‐temperature pyrolysis in an argon atmosphere. This synthesis method enables the partial dissociation of inner FeMn PBAs that results in hollow interiors, Ni nanoparticles (NPs) exsolution to the surface, and Se incorporation onto the PBA shell.

To overcome this critical problem, we synthesized heme-graphene composites (HEME-GO) as catalysts for Li-O               2               batteries. The introduction of graphene produced               π               -               π               interactions with the heme matrix, resulting in a composite with enhanced ORR/OER catalytic activity. The free energy diagram of the redox reaction was calculated using density functional theory (DFT) for HEME-GO based on the four-electron reaction pathway, and it was demonstrated that HEME-GO has the lowest ORR overpotential (0.67 V) and OER overpotential (0.53 V). The catalytic mechanism of HEME-GO was also quantitatively described by calculating the adsorption energy of intermediates in the rate determining step (RDS). In addition, the Li-O               2               batteries with the composite catalyst exhibited better cycling performance, discharge capacity (7770 mAh g               −1               ), and lower overpotential due to the ability of heme to scavenge superoxide radicals and thus protect the electrode.

In this contribution, atomic-scale details of the catalytic active phase will be presented, showing that NiFe LDHs are oxidized under applied anodic potentials from as-prepared α-phase to activated γ-phase.               2               The OER active γ-phase was characterized by operando wide angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) in alkaline electrolytes.               2               The intrinsic activity was then obtained by an electrochemical impedance method through electrochemical surface area (ECSA) normalization.               3               Comparison with other Ni- and Co- based LDHs revealed that NiFe LDH shows the highest intrinsic activity.               4               Our density functional theory (DFT) calculations on a γ-phase atomic model showed that O-bridged Ni-Fe reaction centers (Ni-O-Fe) stabilize OER intermediates that are unfavourable on Ni-O-Ni centers and single Fe sites, fundamentally accounting for the high catalytic activity. Furthermore, our DFT calculations predicts that γ-NiFe LDH is close to, but not on, the top of the OER volcano.               2,4               Strategies to modify the catalytic active site to approach the top of the volcano will be presented, together with preliminary experimental results.

The surface area of thin films increased from 300 °C to 400 °C owing to degradation of the organic template, while the growth of the mesopores from 400 °C to 500 °C resulted in significant decline of the overall (electrochemical) surface area.

In addition, this catalyst also has an excellent intrinsic activity (high mass activity of 162.0 A g               −1               and TOF of 0.063 s               −1               at the overpotential of 350 mV) and remarkable long‐term stability (at least 32 h at a current density of 10 mA cm               −2               ). This study offers a simple and environmentally friendly method to construct highly efficient electrocatalysts for water oxidation.","2021-06-08","2026-01-07 02:56:56","2026-01-08 04:55:33","2026-01-07 02:56:56","2719-2725","","11","13","","ChemCatChem","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\Administrator\Zotero\storage\AAF49HHX\Zhou 等 - 2021 - Simple Construction of Amorphous Monometallic Cobalt‐Based Selenite Nanoparticles using Ball Milling.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As one of the most important half‐reactions for water splitting reactions, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a kinetically sluggish process that will greatly affect the energy conversion efficiency. Therefore, exploring a highly efficient and durable catalyst to boost the OER is of great urgency. In this work, we develop a facile strategy for the synthesis of well‐defined phosphorus and fluorine co‐doped Ni               1.5               Co               1.5               N               hybrid nanorods (HNs) by using ionic liquids (ILs; 1‐butyl‐3‐methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate).

The lyophilization step during the catalyst preparation leads to a uniform dispersion of carbon‐like precursors and avoids the agglomeration of metal particles.

Meanwhile, lattice distortion and the formation of metal vacancies can be observed due to the introduction of metals with different ionic radii and the dissolution of Ca               2+               . Given the stability and abundant active sites of high‐entropy material, the CaCoNiCuZnFe shows good OER performance with an overpotential of 310.7 mV at 10 mA cm               −2               and long‐term stability of 250 h. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that lattice distortion optimizes intermediate adsorption energy by enhancing M─O covalency and metal vacancy activates lattice oxygen by generating non‐bonding oxygen, which synergistically triggers the lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM).

To this end, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) utilising transition metal oxide–carbon composites in alkaline media is considered a robust technology. In many such systems, carbon is used as a conductive additive or support, and the interactions between carbon support materials and the active phase affect the efficiency of the electrocatalyst. Cobalt forms some of the most active and stable electrocatalysts for OER. In carbon-supported systems, the dispersion of the cobalt phase on the carbon surface is a key factor in influencing the catalyst activity in water-splitting reactions. In this study, a low-temperature plasma treatment is used to boost the efficiency of the cobalt active phase by functionalising the carbon support with various oxygen groups. We used a simple deposition–precipitation method to obtain cobalt hydroxide active phase over graphene nanoparticles. The activation of graphene nanoparticles with oxygen plasma allowed us to obtain a catalyst that showed only 317 mV@10 mA·cm−2. More importantly, in the series of plasma-activated samples, the OER activity was very high in a range of cobalt phase loadings, yielding a material with 2.4 wt.% of cobalt and an overpotential of only 327 mV@10 mA·cm−2. The results indicate that plasma activation of GNP support maximises the usage of the transition metal active phase, which allows for an improvement in area-normalised and a dramatic improvement in the mass-normalised OER electrocatalytic activity.","2025-03-29","2026-01-07 02:59:00","2026-01-08 04:55:31","2026-01-07 02:59:00","1522","","7","30","","Molecules","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\Administrator\Zotero\storage\GID2NYUD\Darvishzad和Stelmachowski - 2025 - Maximising the Potential of Reactive Carbon Support with Cobalt Active Phase for the Oxygen Evolutio.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, their self-stacking leads to limited active sites and low conductivity. In this work, a three-dimensional (3D) core–shell architecture with spatially separated active sites has been fabricated based on layered ternary nickel cobalt iron hydroxide (NiCoFe-LTH) nanosheets and cobalt iron Prussian blue analog (CoFe-PBA) on nickel foam (NF) (i.e., CoFe-PBA@NiCoFe-LTH/NF) with CoFe-PBA as self-sacrificial templates that are partially in situ transformed into NiCoFe-LTH nanosheets. The CoFe-PBA@NiCoFe-LTH/NF has a well-defined core–shell 3D flower-like nanostructure in which NiCoFe-LTH nanosheets create the larger shell while CoFe-PBA nanocubes form the small core. This hybrid structure is evaluated as an electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and found to exhibit a low overpotential of 228 mV at 10 mA cm−2, a low Tafel slope of 36 mV dec−1, and good catalytic stability for 72 h in 1.0 M alkaline solution. The strong performance is attributed to the unique 3D core–shell flower-like nanosheet architecture that avoids the stacking of the 2D LTH, provides abundant spatially separated active sites, and enhances electron transport and stability.

Here, the overpotential (η) of Sc(OH)2N3 was 1.03 V; Sc(OH)2N4 had two reaction paths and the η of path 1 was 0.80 V, which was 0.30 V lower than that of path 2. Therefore, Sc(OH)2N4 can be used as a stable and promising OER catalyst with easy desorption of O2 and good cycle performance. The hydroxyl ligand modification of Sc-NxC3−x@SACs and Sc-NxC4−x@SACs provides a method for studying the catalytic performance of other rare earth elements.","2023-03-17","2026-01-07 03:04:25","2026-01-08 04:55:30","2026-01-07 03:04:25","175","","3","9","","Batteries","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\Administrator\Zotero\storage\56CYYDUM\Liu 等 - 2023 - Density Functional Theory Study of Oxygen Evolution Reaction Mechanism on Rare Earth Sc-Doped Graphe.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While it is assumed to be hydrated Cu               2               O               3               at this potential with ∆G = 208.5 kJ/mol, this hypothesis awaits validation. However, our calculations show that bulk CuOOH has ∆G ~209.5 kJ/mol, indicating Cu               +3               possibly in the form of bulk CuOOH. To verify this, we employ a combination of density functional theory (DFT) electronic structure calculations and simulated Raman spectra. This approach allows us to examine the electrocatalytic activity of CuOOH polymorphs, including Cmc21 (β-CuOOH), Pmn21 (γ-CuOOH), and C2/m (δ-CuOOH), for the OER at this potential. Our calculations indicate a presence of stable square planar, non-magnetic γ/δ-CuOOH phase, and the calculated volume Pourbaix diagram highlights γ/δ-CuOOH as the newly discovered active phase governing the OER in alkaline media. This finding is further supported by simulated Raman spectroscopy, revealing distinct features corresponding to Cu               3+               species at 552 and 573 cm               -1               , closely matching experimental data peak at 587 cm               -1               only present under highly oxidizing conditions. Next, we compare the theoretical overpotentials of all CuOOH surfaces with O                              and OH-vacancy at the bridge site as the active site, and the surface-adsorbed OH* on a CuO surface. We find that the (021) surface of CuOOH and the (002) surface of CuOOH are the most active, characterized by an overpotential ranging from 0.36V to 0.50 V. Lastly, we demonstrate that the overpotential of the CuOOH (021) surface can be improved further by surface substitution of Cu by Fe. This finding could explain the experimentally observed enhancement in the OER activity of Fe               y               Cu               1−y               OOH thin films with increasing Fe content.

In developing cost-effective stable materials for the oxygen evolution reaction with high activity, precisely tuning the structure of transition-metal materials in atomic level to obtain ideal chemical properties is urgent while difficult to achieve               1               . In this study, we propose a “dual ligand synergistic modulation” tactics to completely solve the painful compromise between the two conflicted indicators: stability and activity. By substituting S ligand into the adjustable and stable structure of layered hydroxides, which was selected as the start noumenon, we obtain a new class of NiCo               2               (S               x               ·OH               2-x               )               y               with single phase and homogenous composition. The elaborated designed dual-ligand catalyst ideally inherits the excellent activity of the conventional transition metal sulfides and the superior stability of the conventional transition metal hydroxides and even exceeds the predecessors. Impressively, the optimized NiCo               2               (SOH)               x               performs a small overpotential of 0.32 V at 10 mA cm               -2               , and shows no decay after 30h accelerated ageing even at a large current density of 100 mA cm               -2               , both of which have entered the top of all the transition-metal hydroxides and sulfides reported to date and exceeded the commercial RuO               2               and Ir/C benchmarks. Theoretical calculations further disclose that the OH ligands on the surface of NiCo               2               (SOH)               x               could attracts electrons from the antibonding orbital of M-S bonds to M-O bonds, resulting in a strengthened binding energy between metal and S                              and thus enhancing the stability. Meanwhile, the synergy between S ligands and OH groups appropriately tunes the electronic structure of NiCo               2               (SOH)               x               and thus renders it with optimal binding energies for OER intermediates (*OH, *O, and *OOH), which is benefit for facilitate the O               2               evolution proceeding.

Hence, herein, we report the preparation, characterization and application of three composites based on doped, multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT_N6) and three different POMs (Na12[(FeOH2)2Fe2(As2W15O56)2]·54H2O, Na12[(NiOH2)2Ni2(As2W15O56)2]·54H2O and Na14[(FeOH2)2Ni2(As2W15O56)2]·55H2O) as ORR and OER electrocatalysts in alkaline medium (pH = 13). Overall, the three POM@MWCNT_N6 composites showed good ORR performance with onset potentials between 0.80 and 0.81 V vs. RHE and diffusion-limiting current densities ranging from −3.19 to −3.66 mA cm−2. Fe4@MWCNT_N6 and Fe2Ni2@MWCNT_N6 also showed good stability after 12 h (84% and 80% of initial current). The number of electrons transferred per O2 molecule was close to three, suggesting a mixed regime. Moreover, the Fe2Ni2@MWCNT_N6 presented remarkable OER performance with an overpotential of 0.36 V vs. RHE (for j = 10 mA cm−2), a jmax close to 135 mA cm−2 and fast kinetics with a Tafel slope of 45 mV dec−1. More importantly, this electrocatalyst outperformed not only most POM@carbon-based composites reported so far but also the state-of-the-art RuO2 electrocatalyst.

Over the last several years, we have investigated various transition metal oxides as potential candidates for OER for artificial photosynthesis, including CoWO               4               , Li               2               CoGeO               4               and various perovskites.               2-4               It has been revealed that these catalysts were not stable in neutral pH and subjected to degradation either thermodynamically or kinetically.                                         In this presentation, we report a new brownmillerite OER catalyst, Sr               2               GaCoO               5               (SGC), with superior performance and durability. At pH 7.0, the catalyst has a specific activity about 7.8-18.3 times higher than that of IrO               2               at the applied electrode potentials between 1.53-1.73 V vs. RHE. With a catalyst loading of 1 mg/cm               2               , the measured overpotential was only 0.38 V at a current density of 10 mA/cm               2               , which maintained unchanged over the testing period of 72 hrs. A comparative study against Sr               2               AlCoO               5               indicates the excellent stability of SGC is related to the presence of gallium oxide in the crystal structure, which may help prevent SGC from dissolution under the OER operation condition in neutral pH, although detailed mechanistic understanding should be further developed by additional studies in the future. Combining this novel OER catalyst with an anodized silver cathode and a triple junction of GaInP/GaInAs/Ge photovoltaic, the CO               2               reduction system demonstrated a solar-to-CO energy conversion efficiency of 13.9% over a period of 19 hrs with no appreciable performance degradation.               5               This result has shown that artificial photosynthesis can indeed be more efficient than the natural photosynthesis process for CO               2               reduction, and should play an important role in addressing the challenges of global warming and climate change.

The general guideline to design active and efficient catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is to achieve high intrinsic activity and the exposure of more density of the interfacial active sites. The heterointerface is one of the most attractive ways that plays a key role in electrochemical water oxidation. Herein, atomically cluster‐based heterointerface catalysts with strong metal support interaction (SMSI) between WMn               2               O               4               and TiO               2               are designed.

The outstanding performance and long‐term durability are due to SMSI, the exposure of interfacial active sites, and accelerated reaction kinetics.

Herein, we present a facile method for the synthesis of a low-cost Ni-Fe-Co material that efficiently catalyzes the oxygen evolution reaction. A mixed transition metal electrocatalyst was synthesized using a nickel-plated iron substrate and a low concentration cobalt reagent. The catalyst was able to achieve competitive current densities (>130 mA cm               −2               ) and still exhibit a low overpotential of 0.30 V at the benchmark current density of 10 mA cm               −2               . The Ni-Fe-Co catalyst was stable and maintained its activity during 24 h of electrolysis in alkaline media. The catalyst was also stable when maintained in ambient conditions for 90 days. This is the first reported oxygen evolution reaction catalyst that exhibits these competitive characteristics and that was synthesized using an environmentally-conscious, one-step process that can be manufactured on an industrial scale.","2020-01-03","2026-01-07 02:35:12","2026-01-08 04:55:25","2026-01-07 02:35:12","046507","","4","167","","J.

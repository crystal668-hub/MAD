    The user question contains an INPUT_JSON with:

    - metals

    - reaction_type

    - metrics_to_predict (each item is either a metric key string, or an object {key,
    unit_hint})

    - product (only present for CO2RR)


    Follow the task in the question and obey these output rules exactly:

    1) Output ONLY two blocks: <think>...</think> and <answer>...</answer>. Do not
    output any other text.

    2) <answer> MUST be a valid JSON object (dict).

    3) The JSON keys MUST exactly match the metric names in metrics_to_predict (same
    spelling and case).

    4) Output ALL metrics listed in metrics_to_predict; do not miss any and do not
    add extra keys.

    5) JSON values MUST be numbers only (no units, no strings).

    6) Use unit_hint if provided (e.g., faradaic_efficiency expects a 0-1 fraction,
    not a percent).

    7) If you are unsure, still output a reasonable numeric estimate (do not output
    null/NaN).


    When solving problems, you MUST first carefully read and understand the helpful
    instructions and experiences:

    [G0]. Format Compliance: Validate strict format compliance by ensuring output
    includes only <think> and <answer> tags, JSON with exact keys from metrics_to_predict,
    and numeric values without units.

    [G1]. Data Accuracy: Use accurate experimental data or precise, catalyst-specific
    literature values from reliable sources to minimize prediction errors and improve
    numeric quality.

    [G2]. Data Sourcing: Always prioritize using external tools to obtain precise
    experimental data for specific catalysts and reactions before predictions, enhancing
    numeric accuracy and reducing reliance on estimates, while maintaining format
    compliance.

    [G3]. Integrated Compliance and Data Sourcing: Maintain strict format compliance
    with <think> and <answer> tags while prioritizing data-driven validation to balance
    numeric accuracy and formatting correctness.

    [G4]. Value Range Validation: After ensuring strict format compliance, validate
    that predicted values fall within scientifically plausible ranges for the specific
    catalyst and reaction type to improve numeric accuracy and reward alignment.

    [G5]. Catalyst-Specific Reasoning: Refine internal reasoning by explicitly considering
    catalyst-specific factors such as synergistic effects to narrow numeric estimates
    when external data is not available, improving prediction precision.'

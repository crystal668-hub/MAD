Development of electrocatalysts that are capable of efficiently oxidizing biomass-derived 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) into 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) is critically important for production of degradable plastics via non-fossil routes. In this study, a facile and scalable immersion synthetic approach has been developed to grow ultrathin nickel hydroxide nanosheets in situ on commercial nickel foam (Ni(OH)2/NF) as an anode for the electrocatalytic oxidation of HMF to FDCA with complete HMF conversion, 100% FDCA yield, and *>*99% faradaic

efficiency at 1.39 V (vs. RHE) within 90 min. Mechanistic studies reveal that the initial oxidation of HMF takes place at the carbonyl group and FDCA is generated through two further oxidation steps. Impressively, the synthesized Ni(OH)2/NF can also be used to electrocatalytically oxidize other alcohol/ aldehyde-containing compounds to the targeted products in alkaline medium with 100% yield and *>*94% faradaic efficiency under a low oxidation potential of 1.39 V (vs. RHE) within short reaction times.

# **Introduction**

With the sharply increased environmental pollution and rapidly depleted nonrenewable fossil reserves, the search for renewable resources has become an urgency to reduce our reliance on petroleum source and mitigate carbon dioxide emission.[1] In this regard, biomass is the most abundant renewable resources on earth that can be used to replace petroleum for production of biofuels and valuable chemicals.[2] The important platform compound. 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) can be synthesized by dehydration of cellulosic biomass and upgraded to high energy density fuels and chemicals by means of catalytic oxidation, hydrogenation and condensation reactions.[2a,3] Among them, the catalytic oxidation of HMF to produce 2,5 furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) has attracted much attention because FDCA can be used to replace the petroleum-derived monomer for production of the degradable plastic.[2c,4] Conventionally, the oxidation of HMF to FDCA is achieved by bio- and thermocatalytic conversion methods.[5] However, the former encounters long fermentation processes and high costs of the bioreactor, whereas the latter requires the use of precious metal catalysts (e.g., Pd, Au and Pt) and harsh reaction conditions (e.g., high reaction temperature, high O2 or air pressure).[4a,b,5,6] It is therefore highly desirable to develop nonprecious catalysts capable of efficiently converting HMF into FDCA under mild conditions.

Recently, the electrocatalytic oxidation (ECO) of HMF to FDCA has attracted increasing attention due to the advantages of low energy consumption, moderate operation conditions and the use of water as oxygen source.[6] Importantly, the ECO of HMF can be readily combined with hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) to simultaneously generate clean hydrogen fuel that adds not only economic value but also energy efficiency.[7] To date, the reported electrocatalysts for ECO of HMF include Ni3S2, [8] NiO-Co3O4, [9] NiCoFe-LDHs,[1a] Ni*x*B,[7] NiFe-LDH,[10] NiOOH[6] and noble metal catalysts (e.g., Pt,[2b] Au[11]). For instance, Sun and co-workers developed Ni3S2 and Ni2P electrocatalysts through one-step sulfurization and phosphidation of commercial nickel foam (NF), respectively.[4b,8] The obtained catalysts can achieve complete HMF conversion with *>*98% FDCA yields and *>*98% faradaic efficiencies (FEs) under an applied potential of 1.423 V (vs. RHE) in 1.0 m KOH. Recently, Wang and co-workers fabricated a hierarchical nanostructure NiO-Co3O4 electrode with plentiful interfacial defects through a simple hydrothermal-annealing method.[9] Their NiO-Co3O4 electrode possesses excellent electrocatalytic activity toward ECO of HMF to FDCA, achieving a 98% FDCA yield with 96% FE under a low potential of 1.45 V (*vs.* RHE). The reported metal hydroxides-based electrocatalysts for ECO of HMF are of bimetallic and trimetallic LDHs.[1a,10] For example, the bimetallic NiFe LDH nanosheets reported by Liu and co-workers can achieve a 99% HMF conversion with a 98% FDCA yield and 99.4% FE within 10 h under a low applied potential of 1.23 V (vs. RHE).[10] However, up till now, only few single metal hydroxides based electrocatalysts have been reported. The first single metal hydroxide electrocatalyst for ECO of HMF was

reported by Grabowski and co-workers in 1991.[12] They formed Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> on a Ni mesh to yield 71% of FDCA with a FE of 84%. Choi and co-workers recently systematically investigated the ECO activity of NiOOH, CoOOH and FeOOH under strong alkaline conditions. [6] Among the three transition-metal hydroxides electrocatalysts investigated, NiOOH showed the best ECO performance, which can achieve a near 100% HMF conversion within 4.7 h with a 96% FDCA yield and a FE of 96% under an applied potential of 1.47 V (vs. RHE).

Herein, we reported a very simple and scalable immersion synthetic approach to grow ultrathin Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> nanosheets in situ on NF. The resultant Ni(OH)2/NF is used as an anode to electrocatalytically oxidize HMF to FDCA and other alcohol/ aldehyde containing compounds to the targeted oxidation products in alkaline medium. Mechanistic studies were carried out to discern the reaction pathway of ECO of HMF to FDCA.

## **Results and Discussion**

## Synthesis and characterization

The typical synthetic procedure of Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>/NF is briefly illustrated (see the Supporting Information, Figure S1). The commercially supplied NF was firstly treated by hydrochloric acid, ethanol and water to remove surface impurities (Figure S2). The treated NF was then immersed in 40 mL aqueous solution containing 2 mmol NiSO<sub>4</sub>·6H<sub>2</sub>O and 4 mmol urea at room temperature for 12 h to allow the growth of Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> nanosheets on NF (denoted as Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>/NF). The field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) images (Figure 1a) confirm the formation of uniform nanosheets on the surface of NF. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images and the corresponding selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (Figure 1b) indicate that the formed nanosheets are ultrathin amorphous nanosheets. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images and the corresponding height profiles further confirm the ultrathin nature of the nanosheets with approximately 3.6 nm in thicknesses (Figure 1c, d).

The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was employed to examine the surface chemical states of the as-synthesized Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>/NF. Figure 1e shows the high resolution XPS spectrum of Ni2p. The peaks centered at 873.5 and 855.9 eV can be respectively assigned to Ni<sup>2+</sup>2p<sub>1/2</sub> and Ni<sup>2+</sup>2p<sub>3/2</sub>.<sup>[10]</sup> Importantly, a spin-energy separation of 17.6 eV for Ni2p<sub>1/2</sub> and Ni2p<sub>3/2</sub> indicates the formation of Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>.<sup>[13]</sup> The high resolution XPS spectrum of O1s (Figure 1f) can be fitted to two peaks, one is assignable to the formation of Ni-OH (531.0 eV) and another is associated to the absorbed water (532.0 eV).<sup>[14]</sup> As expected, owing to its amorphous nature,<sup>[15]</sup> no diffraction peak of Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> is visible in the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the assynthesized Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>/NF (Figure S3). The above results confirm that the as-synthesized Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>/NF is made of ultrathin amorphous Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> nanosheets on NF.

## **Electrocatalytic oxidation performance**

The ECO performance of the obtained  $Ni(OH)_2/NF$  was evaluated using a H-type electrochemical cell consisting of a standard three-electrode system with a  $1\times1\times0.1$  cm<sup>3</sup>  $Ni(OH)_2/NF$  or bare NF working electrode, a calibrated Hg/HgO reference electrode and a Pt mesh counter electrode. Unless otherwise stated, a 25 mL 1.0 m KOH solution with or without 10 mm HMF was employed.

Figure 2a shows the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves of  $Ni(OH)_2/NF$  and NF in the presence and absence of HMF. In

the absence of HMF, the LSV response of NF is resulted from the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). For Ni(OH)2/NF, the recorded response within the potential window #I can be assigned to the oxidation of Ni<sup>2+</sup> to Ni<sup>3+,[7,16]</sup> while OER takes place within the potential windows #II and #III. Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>/NF and NF require 1.62 and 1.69 V (vs. RHE), respectively, to achieve an anodic current density of 50 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. In the presence of 10 mm HMF, the increased current densities observed from Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>/NF within the potential windows #I and #II are resulted from OER and ECO of HMF. However, after 1.4 V (vs. RHE), the significantly increased current density is mainly attributed to ECO of HMF, indicating an excellent electrocatalytic activity of Ni(OH)2/NF toward HMF. As a control sample, the current density of the NF electrode also increases in the presence of HMF at 1.6 V (vs. RHE), confirming that the oxidation of HMF is also thermodynamically more favorable than water oxidation over the bare NF. However, the Tafel slope of Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>/NF is significantly reduced from 284.9 to 84.1 mV dec<sup>-1</sup> after addition 10 mm HMF (Figure 2b), further indicating that ECO of HMF is more favorable than OER. Figure S4 shows the cyclic voltammetry (CV) responses of Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>/NF and NF in 1.0 M KOH. The pair of redox peaks observed from Ni(OH)2/NF corresponds to the reversible redox reaction of Ni<sup>2+</sup> ⇌Ni<sup>3+,[7,16]</sup> Importantly, within the potential window of 1.3-1.4 V (vs. RHE), the measured current density from Ni(OH)2/NF is much higher than that from NF, implying that Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>/NF possesses much more active sites and/or much larger active surface area than that of NF. Figure S5 shows CV curves of Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>/NF and NF within a

nonfaradaic potential range, which are used to derive the double-layer capacitances ( $C_{\rm dl}$ ) of the corresponding electrodes (Figure 2c). The measured  $C_{\rm dl}$  for Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>/NF is 388.9 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>, which is 45 times of that for NF (8.46 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>), confirming that Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>/NF has a much larger electrochemical surface areas (ECSA) than that of NF. The charge transfer resistance ( $R_{\rm ct}$ ) is an important performance indicator and was therefore measured by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Figure 2d shows the Nyquist plots of Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>/NF in the presence and absence of 10 mm HMF. The significantly reduced  $R_{\rm ct}$  in the presence of 10 mm HMF suggests that Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>/NF possesses a faster charge-transfer kinetics for ECO of HMF than that for OER.

The performance of  $Ni(OH)_2/NF$  toward ECO of HMF was then quantitatively evaluated. For all experiments, the yielded oxidation products were quantified by HPLC (Figure S6). The impact of the applied potential on ECO of HMF was firstly studied under a fixed reaction time of 90 min (Figure 3a and Table S1).

The results reveal an optimal potential of 1.39 V (vs. RHE) for ECO of HMF to FDCA. A set of chronoamperometric experiments were also performed to test whether the NF substrate made a noticeable contribution to the ECO of HMF achieved by Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>/NF. As shown in Figure S7, comparing with the chronoamperometric curve of Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>/NF at 1.39 V (vs. RHE; Figure 3d), the current densities obtained from NF over the five consecutive experimental cycles are much lower (< 15 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>), implying that the effect of NF on the ECO performance of Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>/NF is negligible. In other words, the observed ECO activity of Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>/NF is due mainly to the presence of the ultrathin amorphous Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> nanosheets. The chronoamperometric experiments under a fixed potential of 1.39 V (vs. RHE) were then performed to investigate the effect of reaction time on HMF conversion and the yielded oxidation products. As shown in Figure S8a, due to the consumption of HMF, the current density decreases with the reaction time. Figure S8b shows the HPLC chromatograms recorded at different reaction times and the determined ECO products are plotted against the reaction time (Figure 3b). At 40 min, 95.3% of HMF is electrocatalytically oxidized to yield 80.7% FDCA, and 11.2% 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furan-carboxylic acid (HMFCA) and 3.4% 2-formyl-5-furancarboxylic acid (FFCA) as the reaction byproducts. As the reaction proceeded to 80 min, although a near 100% HMF conversion is achieved, the yielded FDCA is only 93.7%, due to the presence of 4.0% HMFCA and 2.3% of FFCA. At 90 min, the residual HMFCA and FFCA are completely converted into FDCA to achieve a 100% FDCA yield. Such a rapid conversion of HMF can effectively prevent the disproportionation of HMF under strong alkali conditions. [3c] Impressively, a superb FE of > 99% is also achieved. Such ECO performance achieved by Ni(OH)2/NF is comparable to or better than the state-of-the-art electrocatalysts reported to date (Table S2). For comparative purpose, the ECO of HMF by NF was also performed using identical conditions as those used for Figure 3b. After 90 min, NF had only electrocatalytically oxidized 11.6% of HMF with 2.1% FDCA yield (Figure S9), further confirming that the superb ECO electrocatalytic activity achieved by  $Ni(OH)_2/NF$  is due to the presence of ultrathin amorphous  $Ni(OH)_2$  nanosheets.

The kinetic properties of Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>/NF and NF for ECO of HMF to FDCA was also investigated by using data derived from Figures S8 and S9. The plot of  $ln(C_{HMF}/C_o)$  against reaction time (Figure 3c) gives a linear relationship, indicating that the ECO of HMF to FDCA is a first-order kinetic reaction. The kinetic constants (*k*) derived from the slope of  $ln(C_{HMF}/C_o)$  vs. time plots are  $7.6 \times 10^{-2}$  and  $1.05 \times 10^{-3}$  min<sup>-1</sup> for Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>/NF and NF, respectively, confirming that the ECO kinetic process of Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>/NF is > 72 times faster than that of NF.

The durability and reusability are important performance indicators for a catalyst and were therefore investigated. The current-time profiles (Figure 3d) and LSV (Figure S10) curves recorded over the five consecutive reuse cycles show no noticeable characteristic change. The Over 97% of FDCA yield and FE are retained at the end of the test (Figure 3e), signifying the excellent durability and reusability of Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>/NF for ECO of HMF. Such superior ECO stability can be attributed to the structural stability of Ni(OH)2/NF as evidenced by the wellretained morphology after the reuse cycles (Figure 3f). Interestingly, after the reuse cycles, the Raman spectrum peak at 462 cm<sup>-1</sup> corresponding to the vibration band of Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> is found to be vanished (Figure S11a), indicating that Ni<sup>2+</sup> is oxidized to higher valence states.<sup>[17]</sup> This is further confirmed by the positively shifted Ni and O peaks<sup>[17]</sup> in the high resolution XPS spectra of Ni2p and O1s after the reuse cycles (Figure 3g,h). As shown by these spectra, the surface Ni<sup>2+</sup> in the assynthesized Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>/NF can be oxidized to higher valence states when subjected to 1.39 V (vs. RHE) for 10 min. Furthermore, the XRD pattern, TEM image and the corresponding SAED pattern (Figures S11b,c) obtained from Ni(OH)2/NF after durability test confirm the amorphous nature of the formed high valence states Ni. These results confirm that under the electrochemical conditions, a rapid oxidation of Ni<sup>2+</sup> to higher valence states takes place at the beginning stage of ECO and the formed high valence Ni species are highly stable during the subsequent ECO process, suggesting that such in situ electrochemically generated high valence Ni species could be the active species responsible for ECO of HMF to FDCA. [2e,17,18]

# Possible reaction pathway

The oxidation of HMF to FDCA is generally achieved by two different pathways (Scheme 1).<sup>[2d]</sup> One is through an initial carbonyl group oxidation to form the HMFCA intermediate (path #I in Scheme 1), and the other is through an initial hydroxy group oxidation to yield 2,5-diformylfuran (DFF) intermediate (path #II in Scheme 1). Both HMFCA and DFF intermediates can then be further oxidized to yield FFCA intermediate, which is finally oxidized to FDCA.

As demonstrated in Figure 3b, in the presence of 10 mm of HMF, the ECO of HMF to FDCA is proceeded mainly through path #I as evidenced by HMFCA being the main initial intermediate (Figure S8b). [8,19] Figure 4a shows the kinetic fitting plots of Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>/NF from ECO of HMFCA and DFF to FDCA,

known. The purposely designed experiments were therefore carried out to confirm the reaction pathway under a high HMF concentration of 50 mm. Figure S12 shows the HPLC chromatograms recorded at different reaction times, and the determined ECO products concentrations are plotted against the reaction time (Figure 4b). The co-existence of HMFCA and DFF intermediates are observable before the reaction proceeded to 480 min, where the unreacted HMF concentration is  $<\!5$  mm. The content ratio of HMFCA and DFF is found to be increased during the initial reaction period and reached a maximum ratio of around 5 at 180 min. The prolonged reaction leads to a decreased HMFCA/DFF content ratio. These results suggest that

with high HMF concentration, a small fraction of ECO of HMF to FDCA can proceed through path #II.

### Substrate scope

The ECO performance of Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>/NF toward other alcohol/ aldehyde containing compounds including furfural, furfuryl alcohol, benzaldehyde and benzyl alcohol were evaluated. Figure S13 shows the chronoamperometric curves of Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>/ NF recorded from in 25 mL 1.0 M KOH containing 10 mm of substrate under a 1.39 V (vs. RHE) applied potential and the achieved substrate conversions, targeted product yields and corresponding FEs are listed in Table 1. As can be seen, for all cases investigated, 100% conversion of the substrates into the targeted acid products with an essentially 100% yield can be attained. The required reaction times for ECO of furfural, furfuryl alcohol, benzaldehyde and benzyl alcohol are 30, 50, 30 and 90 min, respectively. These results demonstrated a generic applicability of Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>/NF toward ECO of alcohol and aldehyde containing compounds to the corresponding carboxylic containing compounds.

## Conclusion

In summary, we have demonstrated a facile immersion synthetic approach to directly grow ultrathin amorphous nickel hydroxide nanosheets in situ on a commercial nickel foam substrate. The as-synthesized catalyst can be applied as an anode for ECO of HMF to FDCA and other alcohol- or aldehydecontaining compounds to the targeted acid products in alkaline medium with 100% yield for the targeted oxidation products and >94% faradaic efficiency under a low oxidation potential of 1.39 V (vs. RHE) within short reaction times. We also proposed the reaction pathway for ECO of HMF to FDCA. In addition, we proposed and validated that the superb ECO performance of Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>/NF resulted from the higher valence Ni species formed during electrocatalysis.

$$E_{\text{RHE}} = E_{\text{Hg/HgO}} + 0.098 + 0.059 \times \text{pH}$$
 (1)

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed by using a CHI 660 spectrometer.

### **Product analysis**

HMF and oxidation products were quantitatively determined by a HPLC (Waters 1525) equipped with an ultraviolet – visible detector and a 4.6 mm  $\times$  150 mm Shim-pack GWS 5  $\mu m$  C 18 column. A mixture of solvents A and B was used as the mobile phase for elution. Solvents A and B were an aqueous solution containing 5 mm ammonium formate and HPLC grade methanol. Separation and quantification were accomplished by using an isocratic elution of 70% A and 30% B at a flow rate of 0.5 mL min $^{-1}$ . The conversion (%), faradaic efficiency (FE), and yield (%) were calculated according to the Equations (2), (3), and (4), respectively:

Conv. (%) = 
$$[n(HMF consumed)/n(HMF initial)] \times 100$$
 (2)

FE (%) = 
$$[n(FDCA formed)/(charge/(6 \times F))] \times 100$$
 (3)

FDCA yield (%) = 
$$[n(FDCA \text{ formed})/n(HMF \text{ initial})] \times 100$$
 (4)

where, F is the Faraday constant (96485 C mol<sup>-1</sup>), and n is the mol of reactant calculated from the concentration measured by HPLC.

Cu-based catalysts are regarded as promising materials for the electro-oxidation of biomass. However, developing effective strategies to improve the intrinsic activity of Cu-based catalysts is still challenging and rarely reported. Herein, we synthesized a nickel-doped copper oxide catalyst (Ni-CuOx) for 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) electro-oxidation to 2,5 furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA). The Ni-CuOx exhibited a large current density of 199.7 mA cm−<sup>2</sup> at 1.4 V, which is 2.8 fold higher than that of pure CuOx, and exceeds most of the reported Cu-based catalysts. Moreover, the Ni-CuOx also showed high FDCA yield (90.1%) and Faradaic efficiency (98.5%). Physical characterizations and electrochemical analyses demonstrated that Ni doping optimizes the electronic structure of Cu sites, and promoting the adsorption of HMF, contributing to enhanced electrocatalytic activity. This work provides insights into the rational design of copper-based catalysts for biomass electro-oxidation.

#### **1. Introduction**

As a renewable and carbon-neutral resource, biomass has shown great promise in substituting traditional fossil resources for chemical synthesis.[\[1,2\]](#page-7-0) 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), a pivotal C6 platform molecule derived from biomass, features active hydroxymethyl and aldehyde groups and a furan ring.[\[3,4\]](#page-7-0) Therefore, HMF can be readily oxidized into value-added products like 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furancarboxylic acid (HMFCA), 5-formyl-2-furancarboxylic acid (FFCA), and 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA).[\[5–7\]](#page-7-0) Among them, FDCA is of significant interest as it serves as a renewable substitute of petroleum-derived terephthalic acid for polymer synthesis.[\[8–10\]](#page-7-0) Efficient HMF-to-FDCA conversion has thus drown numerous research interest during the past decades.[\[11,12\]](#page-7-0) Compared to traditional catalytic methods, electro-oxidation of HMF offers significant advantages as it operates under ambient conditions without the need of external oxidants.[\[13–16\]](#page-7-0) In pursuit of higher catalytic efficiency and product selectivity, significant research efforts have been directed toward developing efficient catalysts for HMF oxidation reaction (HMFOR).

Non-noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Ni- and Cobased materials, have exhibited high performance in HMFOR, achieving large current densities (*>* 100 mA cm−<sup>2</sup> ), nearly quantitative HMF conversion, and high FDCA yields (*>*80%).[\[17–23\]](#page-7-0) Nevertheless, these catalysts face significant challenges under elevated anode potentials, where oxygen evolution reaction (OER) competes severely with HMFOR, posing a critical limitation for the industrial-scale applications.[\[24,25\]](#page-8-0) In contrast, Cu-based materials generally exhibit inherently lower OER activity, making them promising alternative catalysts for biomass electrooxidation.[\[26–28\]](#page-8-0) For example, Shi et al. compared the OER activities of Cu2O and NiO, revealing that Cu2O requires 106 mV higher potential than NiO to derive a OER current density of 100 mA cm−<sup>2</sup> . [\[29\]](#page-8-0) Moreover, Wang et al. found that CuO not only exhibits lower OER activity than CoOOH and NiOOH catalysts, but also exhibits higher Faradaic efficiency (FE) and productivity for glucose electro-oxidation to formate.[\[26\]](#page-8-0) Nevertheless, Cu-based catalysts remain understudied for biomass electro-oxidation. Although several previous studies reveal that biomass oxidation over Cu-based catalysts proceeds through an "indirect oxidation" pathway mediated by electrogenerated Cu<sup>3</sup><sup>+</sup> species, significant challenges persist in improving the performance, and revealing the structure-performance relationship.[\[30,31\]](#page-8-0) Heteroatom doping has been widely demonstrated as an effective strategy to modulate the electronic structure of catalytically active sites, giving rise to optimized adsorption of reactants. For example, Xia et al. reported a catalyst with Mo doping Co3O4 nanowires.[\[32\]](#page-8-0) Electrochemical results and DFT calculations suggested that the doping of Mo promotes the redistribution of electrons, resulting in a stronger HMF adsorption energy at the Co sites after doping, thereby facilitating the HMFOR and Lu et al. prepared a Co-doped Ni(OH)2 catalyst.[\[33\]](#page-8-0) The doping of Co has adjusted the electronic structure of Ni(OH)2 and the substrate adsorption energy, thereby enhancing the oxidation activity of HMF. It is thus expected that incorporating heteroatoms into the copper

oxide lattice may enhance the electrocatalytic activity. Nevertheless, this strategy remains scarcely explored in the context of copper oxide-based catalysts for HMFOR.

In this work, we prepared heteroatom-doped copper oxide catalyst via ion exchange followed by high-temperature calcination. Among various doped copper oxide catalysts, the Ni-doped copper oxide (Ni-CuOx) exhibits the optimal catalytic performance for HMFOR, deriving a high current density of 199.7 mA cm−<sup>2</sup> at a low potential of 1.4 V, exhibiting a 2.8-fold enhancement in current density compared to the pristine CuOx electrode. Moreover, the Ni-CuOx also showed FDCA yield of 90.1%, and FE of 98.5%, as well as good electrochemical stability. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), open-circuit potential (OCP) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analyses demonstrated that Ni doping optimizes the electronic structure, facilitating HMF adsorption, thereby contributing to significantly enhanced HMFOR activity.

## **2. Results and Discussion**

The synthesis process of Ni-CuOx is schematically illustrated in Figure [1a.](#page-2-0) In the first step, pretreated copper foam (CF) was electro-oxidized in KOH aqueous solution to produce Cu(OH)2 nanowires supported on CF (Cu(OH)2/CF). Subsequently, the resultant Cu(OH)2/CF was immersed in a NiCl2 solution for ion exchange, generating a Ni-doped precursor, which was then calcinated in the air atmosphere to obtain Ni-CuOx. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of Ni-CuOx in Figure [1b,c](#page-2-0) reveal a nanoarray structure, which consists of vertically arranged nanorods with a typical width of approximately 100 nm. Moreover, evident voids exist between these nanorods, which is favorable for the access of electrolyte and the expose of active sites. Moreover, CuOx exhibited a nanorods morphology similar to that of Ni-CuOx (Figure S1a,b), indicating that the doping of Ni does not change the microstructure of CuOx. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) images (Figure [1d,e\)](#page-2-0) further reveal the porous structure of Ni-CuOx nanorods, which is composed of 10–20 nm nanoparticles. The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image of Ni-CuOx in Figure [1f](#page-2-0) exhibits clear lattice fringes, with a lattice spacing of 0.256 and 0.249 nm corresponding to the (002) crystal planes of CuO and the (111) crystal planes of Cu2O, respectively. This result indicates that Ni-CuOx is a mixture of CuO and Cu2O. Similar results were also observed from the HRTEM images of the undoped CuOx (Figure S1c,d), which show the (111) and (11–1) crystal planes of CuO and the (111) crystal plane of Cu2O. In addition, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) elemental mapping (Figure [1g\)](#page-2-0) analysis demonstrated the presence and uniform distribution of Ni, Cu, and O elements in the Ni-CuOx nanorods. Moreover, The EDX spectrum (Figure S2) shows that the atomic ratios of Cu and Ni are 42.35% and 2.18%, respectively, suggesting the successful doping of Ni into CuOx.

The crystal structures of Ni-CuOx and CuOx were investigated using X-ray diffraction (XRD). As show in Figure [2a,](#page-3-0) both of Ni-CuOx and CuOx exhibit four obvious peaks. The two diffraction peaks at 35.2° and 38.5° which match well with the diffraction peaks of CuO (PDF# 48–1548) and the other two peaks at 36.4° and 42.3° correspond to the Cu2O (PDF# 05–0667). The Cu2O is likely formed through a redox reaction between Cu(OH)2 and metallic copper (Cu(OH)2 + Cu → Cu2O + H2O) during the calcination process.[\[34,35\]](#page-8-0) The presence of these peaks indicates that Ni-CuOx is a composite material composing of CuO and Cu2O phases, consistent with the findings from HRTEM analysis. Moreover, three strong peaks at 43.3°, 50.4°, and 74.1° can be attributed to copper from the CF substrate. Specifically, no new diffraction peaks were observed after the Ni doping of CuOx, suggesting that Ni is not present in the form of NiO or Ni0, but is incorporated into the CuOx lattice. Raman spectra (Figure [2b\)](#page-3-0) disclose CuOx exhibited two characteristic peaks in the range of 272 cm−<sup>1</sup> and 320 cm−<sup>1</sup> , which are attributed to Cu─O stretching vibration.[\[36\]](#page-8-0) A newly emerged peak at 532 cm−<sup>1</sup> can be unambiguously observed in Ni-CuOx and it is assigned to the Ni─O stretching vibration.[\[37\]](#page-8-0) This phenomenon indicates the successful introduction of Ni element into CuOx. To investigate electronic structure and valence states of the Ni-CuOx, XPS was performed. Figure S3 displays the XPS survey spectrum of Ni-CuOx, indicating the coexistence of Cu, Ni, and O elements.[\[38\]](#page-8-0) Based on the XPS spectrum, the atomic percentages of Cu and Ni are 32.4% and 6.13%, which is consistent with the EDX results. As show in Figure [2c,](#page-3-0) Cu 2p XPS spectra of CuOx and Ni-CuOx, exhibit 2p3/2 peaks at 932.6 eV, corresponding to Cu/Cu+. Another peak at 933.9 eV is attributed to Cu<sup>2</sup>+, accompanied by broad satellite peaks.[\[39,40\]](#page-8-0) The ratio of Cu/Cu<sup>+</sup> increased from 30% in CuOx to 49% in Ni-CuOx, indicating the introduction of Ni in CuOx reduces the oxidation states and modulates the electronic structure of copper sites. Ni 2p XPS spectra of Ni-CuOx (Figure [2d\)](#page-3-0) exhibit 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 peaks at 855.7 and 873.4 eV, respectively, corresponding to Ni<sup>2</sup>+. [\[41–43\]](#page-8-0) O 1 s XPS spectra (Figure S4) were deconvoluted into three components with peaks at 529.6, 531.5, and 533.2 eV corresponding to lattice oxygen (OLatt), adsorbed oxygen (OAds) and adsorbed H2O groups (OWater), respectively.[\[39,44\]](#page-8-0) The decreased proportion of OLatt from 55% in CuOx to 51% in Ni-CuOx, indicating reduced electron density on OLatt. This suggests that Ni introduction induces electron transfer within the catalyst. Collectively, these results confirm the successful synthesis of Ni-doped copper oxide catalysts via electrochemical oxidation coupled with ion exchange and calcination. The incorporation of Ni regulates the electronic structure of copper sites and promotes electron transfer within the catalyst.

Electrocatalytic HMFOR activity for the catalysts was evaluated in 1 M KOH with 50 mM HMF electrolyte. The linear scanning voltammetry (LSV) curves of Ni-CuOx are shown in Figure [3a.](#page-4-0) The OER onset potential was observed at ∼1.5 V, and the HMFOR shows a significantly lower onset potential (∼1.1 V), suggesting that HMFOR is energetically more favorable than OER. Moreover, in the presence of 50 mM HMF, Ni-CuOx only needs a potential of 1.35 V to achieve a large current density of 100 mA cm−<sup>2</sup> , which is 70 mV lower than CuOx (Figure [3b\)](#page-4-0) and the current density of the Ni-CuOx at 1.4 V is approximately 2.8 times as great as that of CuOx (Figure [3c\)](#page-4-0). The high activity of Ni-CuOx also exceeds most of the previously reported Cu-based catalysts, demonstrate the positive effect of Ni doping on HMFOR activity. In addition, CuOx

catalysts doped with various metal elements such as Co, Ru, and Fe were also prepared. The LSV results (Figure S5) indicated that both Co and Ru doping could enhance HMFOR activity, proving that the strategy of transition metal doping is universally applicable. Subsequently, the effect of NiCl2 solution concentration on HMFOR activity was evaluated (Figure S6). Among various catalysts, the one prepared by using 10 mM NiCl2 demonstrated the highest HMFOR activity.

Figure [3d](#page-4-0) calculates the Tafel slope of the catalyst in a 50 mM HMF solution, the Tafel slope of Ni-CuOx (235.7 mV dec−<sup>1</sup> ) is smaller than that of CuOx (252.6 mV dec−<sup>1</sup> ), indicating that Ni doping accelerates the kinetics of the HMFOR reaction process.[\[45\]](#page-8-0) The catalytic kinetic characteristics of the two catalysts under HMFOR and OER conditions were further analyzed through the Nyquist plots via EIS analyses. Figure [3e](#page-4-0) presents potential-dependent EIS evolutions of CuOx and Ni-CuOx electrodes, along with the equivalent circuit.[\[46\]](#page-8-0) In the diagram, Rs, Rct, and CPE represent the solution resistance, charge transfer resistance, and the constant phase element representing the electric double-layer capacitance, respectively.[\[46\]](#page-8-0) The Nyquist plot of Ni-CuOx demonstrates a semicircle with the smaller diameter compared to CuOx, proving that Ni doping effectively enhances the interfacial charge transfer kinetics, likely due to improved electronic conductivity and optimized surface catalytic activity.[\[47,48\]](#page-8-0) Furthermore, the electrochemical surface area (ECSA) was evaluated through calculation of the electrochemical double-layer capacitance (Cdl) within the nonfaradaic potential region using cyclic voltammetry (Figure S7).[\[49\]](#page-8-0) As depicted in Figure [3f,](#page-4-0) the Ni-CuOx catalyst exhibited a Cdl value of 583.4 mF cm−<sup>2</sup> , significantly exceeding that of pristine CuOx (396.0 mF cm−<sup>2</sup> ). This pronounced enhancement in Cdl indicates that Ni doping effectively increases the accessible electrochemically active surface area of the CuO-based material. After normalizing the LSV curves by the ECSA (Figure S8), the Ni-CuOx requires a

lower applied potential (60 mV) than CuOx to achieve 50 mA cm−<sup>2</sup> ECSA, demonstrating enhanced intrinsic activity after the introduction of Ni.

It was documented that HMFOR in alkaline medium proceeds through two different pathways, as displayed in Figure [4a.](#page-5-0) It was observed that aldehyde group was firstly oxidized into carboxyl group to obtain HMFCA (defined as "path I") or hydroxyl group into the aldehyde group leading to formation 2,5-diformylfuran (DFF, defined as "path II"). Then, both HMFCA or DFF species was oxidized to FFCA and the FDCA, successively.[\[50–52\]](#page-8-0) To investigate the reaction pathway and product distribution during HMFOR over Ni-CuOx, continuous electrocatalysis was carried out at a fixed potential of 1.5 V. The electrolyte was periodically taken out and analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) based on external standard method. The HPLC chromatogram in Figure [4b](#page-5-0) shows that with the increase of passed charge, the signal of HMF gradually weakened while FDCA exhibited an opposite trend.[\[53\]](#page-8-0) This confirms that increasing the passed charge drives continuous consumption of HMF and gradually formation of FDCA. Specifically, HMF conversion of nearly 100% and FDCA yield of 95% were achieved after a passing charge of 60 C (Figure [4c\)](#page-5-0). Moreover, the HPLC chromatograms show the presence of HMFCA and FFCA as the major intermediates, indicating that pathway I is dominant over Ni-CuOx. The performance of the different electrodes was compared in Figure [4d,](#page-5-0) showing that the yield and FE of FDCA on Ni-CuOx are higher than that of CuOx at the same potential. This result further indicates that Ni doping promoted electrocatalytic oxidation of HMF. Furthermore, we investigated the yield and FE of FDCA at different potentials. As show in Figure [4e,](#page-5-0) an optimal FE of 98.5% and a corresponding yield of 90.1% were achieved at 1.5 V and a high FE of 79.62% can be preserved even at a high potential of 1.6 V, highlighting the potential of Ni-CuOx catalyst for HMFOR under industrially relevant current densities. Moreover, five successive HMFOR cycles were carried out at 1.5 V to examine the durability of Ni-CuOx, as show in

Figures [4f](#page-5-0) and S9. The FDCA yield remained at around 90% and that of FE retain over 95% during HMFOR electrolysis with five successive cycles, suggesting that the Ni-CuOx is durable during five HMFOR cycles. TEM and XRD analyses were employed to characterize the catalyst after the stability test, providing further evidence for its stability. As show in Figure S10, two diffraction peaks at 35.2°, and 38.5° were observed, corresponding to CuO (PDF# 48–1548), and no new diffraction peaks were observed. The disappearance of the Cu2O peak in XRD can be attributed to the oxidation of Cu2O during the reaction process to form CuO. Moreover, the TEM image in Figure S11 shows that the catalyst after the reaction still maintains a porous nanorod structure, and lattice spacing at 0.253 nm and 0.231 nm were observed, which correspond to the (002) and (200) crystal plane of CuO, respectively, which are consistent with the XRD results, further demonstrating the excellent structural stability of Ni-CuOx.

To disclose the origin of the improved HMFOR activity over the Ni-CuOx catalyst, electrochemical tests were carried out. Given that the electrogenerated Cu<sup>3</sup><sup>+</sup> sites are deemed as HMFOR active sites, we first evaluated the number of Cu<sup>3</sup><sup>+</sup> active sites of the catalyst using the multipotential step method (Figure S12). As show in the Figure 5a, the concentration of Cu3<sup>+</sup> sites on Ni-CuOx is comparable to CuOx, demonstrating that the enhanced performance of Ni-CuOx originates from improvement in intrinsic activity, rather than more exposed active sites. To evaluate the adsorption behavior of HMF on the catalysts, we performed the OCP measurement, a well-established method that reflects the variation of absorbates in the Helmholtz layer.[\[54,55\]](#page-8-0) As depicted in Figure 5b, upon injecting 50 mM HMF, a noticeably larger decrease (565.8 mV) was observed with the Ni-CuOx electrode than that with CuOx electrode (375.2 mV), suggesting a more pronounced surface adsorption of HMF. This phenomenon may be attributed to the doping of Ni, which regulates the electronic structure of Cu sites and enhances the adsorption of HMF. Furthermore, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out to gain further insight into the effect of Ni doping. As depicted in Figure 5c–e, the adsorption energies (Ead) of HMF on CuOx and Ni-CuOx were calculated to be −2.33 eV and −3.57 eV, respectively. The more negative Ead value on Ni-CuOx suggests that Ni doping significantly enhances the adsorption of HMF, which is consistent with the OCP measurement results. To further analyze the interfacial

<span id="page-7-0"></span>electrochemical behavior during the catalysis process, in situ EIS was employed.[\[24,56\]](#page-8-0) As show in the Bode plots in Figure S13, with the increase of potential, the phase angle of CuOx and Ni-CuOx in the low-frequency region significantly decreases at 1.5 V, suggesting that OER occurs at this potential.[\[57\]](#page-8-0) When HMF was added, the phase angle significantly decreases at 1.1 V, representing that the HMFOR on the catalyst is more advantageous than OER.[\[24\]](#page-8-0) Moreover, in the potential range of the HMFOR, the phase angle value of Ni-CuOx is significantly lower than that of CuOx, which also confirms that the HMFOR reaction rate of Ni-CuOx is faster, further demonstrating that the doping of Ni accelerates the electron transfer on the catalyst.

## **3. Conclusion**

In summary, the Ni-CuOx was synthesized via electrochemical oxidation, ion exchange and calcination process. It exhibits superior HMFOR performance, achieving a high current density of 199.7 mA cm−<sup>2</sup> at 1.4 V, surpassing that of CuOx, alongside a 90% FDCA yield and 98% FE at 1.5 V. Experimental analysis suggests that the enhanced HMFOR performance originates from Ni doping optimizing the electronic structure at Cu sites, thereby facilitating electron transfer during the reaction. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of transition metal doping for modifying copper-based catalysts and highlights the significant potential of doped materials within HMFOR systems.

#### **4. Experimental Section**

*Pretreatment of CF:* A piece of square CF (1 cm × 1.2 cm) was ultrasonically treated in ethanol and dilute hydrochloric acid (H2O: HCl = 2: 1) for 10 minutes, respectively, to remove surface impurities and surface oxide layer. Then rinsed with deionized water.

*Preparation of Cu(OH)2/CF:* The Cu(OH)2/CF was synthesized via an electrochemical oxidation method. Specifically, 16.8 g KOH was dissolved in 40 mL deionized water as an electrolyte. A threeelectrode system was employed, in which a Hg/HgO electrode served as the reference electrode, a graphite rod as the counter electrode, and a pretreated CF as the working electrode. The oxidation potential was −0.075 VHg/HgO, and the oxidation time was 500 seconds. After rinsing with deionized water and drying at 60 °C, the Cu(OH)2/CF electrocatalyst was obtained.

*Preparation of CuOx and Ni-CuOx:* Ni-CuOx was prepared by a method combining ion exchange and calcination. 0.0238 g of NiCl2 (10 mM) was dissolved in 10 mL of deionized water and ultrasonically treated for 10 minutes. Then, the Cu(OH)2/CF was immersed in NiCl2 solution, and subjected to a constant temperature water bath at 25 °C for 3 hours to obtain the Ni-doped precursor. The obtained precursor was then calcined at 200 °C for 1 hour under air atmosphere to synthesize Ni-CuOx. For comparison, undoped CuOx was prepared by the same method without soaking in a metal salt solution and CuOx doped with other metal elements was prepared by substituting 0.0238 g of NiCl2 with 0.0238 g of CoCl2 (10 mM), 0.0162 g of FeCl3 (10 mM), and 0.0208 g of RuCl2 (10 mM), respectively.

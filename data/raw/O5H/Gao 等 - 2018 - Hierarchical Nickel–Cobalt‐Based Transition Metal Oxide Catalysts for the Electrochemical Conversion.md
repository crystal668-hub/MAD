**Abstract:** Biomass upgrading into sustainable and valuable fine chemicals is alternative to the state-of-the-art petrochemicals. Typically, conversion of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) biomass derivative into 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) has been recognized as an economic and green approach to replace current polyethylene terephthalate-based plastic industry. However, this reaction mostly relies on noble-based catalysts for sluggish aerobic oxidation of alcohol groups. In this work, we report a series of hierarchical Ni-Co based transition metal oxide catalysts for HMF oxidation by electrocatalysis. Comprehensive material characterizations and electrochemical evaluations have been performed. 90% FDCA yield, nearly 100% Faradaic efficiency and robust stability were achieved for NiCo2O4 nanowires. As nonprecious catalysts, Ni-Co based transition metal oxide may open up a type of potential materials for highly efficient electrochemical biomass upgrading.

### **Introduction**

Fossil fuel-based fine chemicals are associated with the modern society. For instance, one of the bulk petrochemicals, polyethylene terephthalate (PET) represents state-of-the-art solid basis of plastic industry (~56 million tons/year).[1] However, the key monomer of terephthalic acid is upgraded from fossil fuels so that the frequently discussed issues are the unsustainability and environmental impacts.[2] Biomass is a renewable and abundant carbon resource that has been recognized a promising feedstock to replace traditional fossil fuel for sustainable energy and chemicals.[3] The biomass hydrolysis derivatives, 5 hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) is considered as one of the most attractive platform molecule that can be further transformed into high-value added versatile chemicals.[4] Typically, 2,5 furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) by selective oxidation of HMF, has

been identified as potential substitute for terephthalic acid to produce bio-based plastics instead of PET.[5] The crucial challenge is the sluggish kinetics for selective oxidation of alcohol groups to carboxylic acid [6] .

Electrocatalysis through directly controlling the electron transfer by the applied potential is an effective approach for HMF upgrading at ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure [7] . For example, the Pt/C electrocatalyst was used to oxidize HMF to FDCA where a high selectivity was resulted compared to the heterogeneous catalysis. [2a] The recent progress was achieved by the developed Au/C, Pd/C and bimetallic PdxAuy/C for electrocatalytic oxidation of HMF. [8] The results revealed that Au and Pd played different roles in oxidation of alcohol and aldehyde groups of HMF. The optimized bimetallic catalyst Pd1Au2/C achieved 83% FDCA yield, which is higher than that of individual monometallic catalysts. The significance of this work demonstrated high selectivity originated from AuPd alloys with preferable synergetic effect.

The development of non-precious catalysts deserves priority for many electrocatalysis fields and also the scale-up production of FDCA by the well-established electrolysis technology. The earlyproposed NiOOH in fact exhibited the potential for Ni-based catalysts. [9] Recently discovered Ni- and Co-based sulfides and phosphides (e.g. Ni3S2, Ni2P and CoP) have been employed for HMF electrocatalysis oxidation, [10] which were previously mostly explored for water splitting including hydrogen evolution (HER) and oxygen evolution reactions (OER). These catalysts showed both high FDCA yield and Faradaic efficiency (FE). However, a debate similar to OER lies in how is the stability of these catalysts under oxidation condition. [11] These catalysts were possibly converted to their oxides/hydroxide counterpart during the reaction. The progress in development of transition metal-based compounds opened up the promising prospective towards highly efficient noble-metal substituted electrocatalysts for HMF oxidation.

In this work, we report hierarchical NixCo3-xO<sup>4</sup> catalysts grown vertically on 3D Ni foam (NF), which were fabricated through a low temperature hydrothermal method for electrocatalytic biomass upgrading. Their structures can be controlled from nanosheets to nanowires by tuning the ratio of Ni/Co. All the NixCo3-xO<sup>4</sup> samples exhibit activities toward HMF oxidation, where introduction of Co significantly enhances the activity. Among NixCo3-xO<sup>4</sup> nanostructures, the NiCo2O<sup>4</sup> nanowires is found showing the best performances including both onset potential and current density. Product analysis demonstrates 90% FDCA yield and nearly 100% FE.

Nanostructured  $Ni_xCo_{3-x}O_4$  were prepared on the nickel foam support via a hydrothermal strategy followed by an annealing treatment (see experimental section for details). Their morphologies were examined by the scanning electron microscopy (SEM). As illustrated in Figure 1, distinguished nanostructures for  $Ni_xCo_{3-x}O_4$  were observed, depending on the Ni/Co atomic ratio, which were also found varied in their color (Figure S1). Figure 1a presents a nanosheet structure of NiO,

which vertically grown on the nickel foam (see Figure S2, the controlled experiment revealed a relatively smooth surface for the bare Ni foam substrate). Upon increasing the Co content (Co: Ni =1:2), the edge of nanosheets tend to convert into nanowires (Figure 1b, Ni<sub>2</sub>CoO<sub>4</sub>). While further increasing Co to Co: Ni =1:1, the nanowires become much more apparent at the edge (Figure 1c, Ni<sub>1.5</sub>Co<sub>1.5</sub>O<sub>4</sub>). Fully converted nanowires structure was obtained when the molar content of Co reached 2/3 (Co: Ni =2:1, Figure 1d, NiCo<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>). And the Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> without Ni component shows an assembled nanowire structure (Figure 1e). From the above results, it is speculated that introducing of Co atoms will significantly affect the morphologies of Ni<sub>x</sub>Co<sub>3-x</sub>O<sub>4</sub> nanostructure.

To further examine the compositions and crystal structures of Ni<sub>x</sub>Co<sub>3-x</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, EDS mapping and XRD were applied for material characterizations. Figure 2a discloses the EDS mapping of the representative NiCo2O4, which reveals that all the Ni, Co and O elements are uniformly dispersed in the nanowires. The atomic percentages are 14.6% Ni, 23.8% Co and 61.6% O with an atomic ratio close to 1: 2: 4. Similar results are also observed for the other four Ni<sub>x</sub>Co<sub>3-x</sub>O<sub>4</sub> oxides with stoichiometry of element distribution (Figure S3). Figure 2b depicts the XRD patterns of  $Ni_xCo_{3-x}O_4$ catalysts, where four main diffraction peaks represent to the Ni foam substrate, i.e., Ni (111), Ni (200), Ni (012) and Ni (220). Upon introducing of Co, the intensity of NiO (111) and NiO (220) featured peaks were found gradually weakened till entirely disappeared when "x=0" in Ni<sub>x</sub>Co<sub>3-x</sub>O<sub>4</sub>. The Ni<sub>2</sub>CoO<sub>4</sub> with relatively low Co content exhibits a cubic NiO dominated crystal structure. With the increase of Co content (Ni<sub>1.5</sub>Co<sub>1.5</sub>O<sub>4</sub> and NiCo<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>), the characteristic XRD patterns of spinel structure appear gradually. Typically, the NiCo<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> shows patterns at 19.23°, 30.65°, 36.2°, 44.66° and 64.41° corresponding to spinel-type (111), (220), (311), (400), (511) and (440) planes. [12] Meanwhile, the signals of cubic NiO (111) and (220) disappear apparently, suggesting a conversion of cubic to spinel crystallinity. However, Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> nanowires (Ni was completely replaced by Co) shows welldefined diffraction patterns indexed to (111), (220), (311), (222), (400), (422), (511), and (440) planes, referring to a cubic crystallite.[13] Overall, the above results confirmed the synthesis of the hierarchical Ni<sub>x</sub>Co<sub>3-x</sub>O<sub>4</sub> catalysts series and the ratio of Co/Ni has a significant effect on the crystal structure of the samples.

#### Electrochemical activity of NixCo<sub>3-x</sub>O<sub>4</sub> for HMF oxidation

The electrocatalytic activities of  $Ni_XCo_{3.X}O_4$  for HMF oxidation were firstly explored by a three-electrode system (Figure 3a). The HMF oxidation occurs at the anode (catalyst working electrode) while the HER occurs at the cathode (carbon rod, counter electrode). A porous ceramic was used for separating the two compartments. Figure 3b shows linear sweep voltammogram

(b) The LSV for the  $NiCo_2O_4$  catalysts at a scan rate of 2 mV s<sup>-1</sup> in 0.1 M KOH without and with 10 mM HMF. (c) A comparison of HMF oxidation LSVs at five  $Ni_xCo_{3-x}O_4$  catalysts. (d) A comparison of HMF oxidation current density at the potential between 1.35 and 1.45 V.

(LSV) curves of a representative NiCo<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> catalyst electrode in 0.1 M KOH with and without HMF. It can be seen that the catalyst itself shows a typical redox peak of Ni2+/3+ at 1.38 V (vs RHE, black curve) [14] and the water oxidation starts after 1.55 V. As shown in Figure S4, the other Ni<sub>X</sub>Co<sub>3-X</sub>O<sub>4</sub> catalysts reveal similar electrochemical behavior except Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, whose redox peak can hardly be observed. Upon adding 10 mM HMF, the current increases remarkably at 1.35 V (red curve, Figure 3b) indicating HMF oxidation by the electro-generated Ni3+. The oxidation of water is either suppressed. Subsequently, the catalytic activities for the five Ni<sub>X</sub>Co<sub>3-X</sub>O<sub>4</sub> catalysts were further compared (Figure 3c). It is performed that NiO shows a weak catalytic ability with high onset potential (> 1.45 V) and low catalytic current density (< 5 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>). After introducing of Co, varying degrees of onset potential and oxidation current density increasing occurred, for example Ni<sub>2</sub>CoO<sub>4</sub> exhibits 150 mV improved onset potential and much higher current density (yellow curve). The activity further increases with the increasing of Co content in Ni<sub>X</sub>Co<sub>3-X</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, while decreases dramatically for Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>.

The Tafel slope for HMF oxidation was further examined as shown in Figure S5. The Tafel slopes were determined for NiO (47 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>), Ni<sub>2</sub>CoO<sub>4</sub> (113 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>), Ni<sub>1.5</sub>Co<sub>1.5</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (261 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>), NiCo<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (238 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>) and Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (447 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>). The NiO shows the lowest slope. With decreasing Ni content, the overall trend for the Tafel slope becomes higher, indicating that Ni

species can improve the kinetics (or electron transfer coefficient) for HMF oxidation. This is consistent with the observation of an increase of catalytic current for Ni<sup>2+/3+</sup> redox peak after introduction of HMF (Figure 3b). On the other hand, the onset potential becomes lower with increase of the Co content (Figure 3c), suggesting that the Co is also a key element. The Tafel slope and onset potential indicate that both Ni and Co elements are essential ingredients, which play a significant role to achieve the synergistic catalytic effect.

We further used cyclic voltammetry measurements by extracting electric double layer capacitance to estimate the electrochemically active surface areas (ECSA). As shown in Figure S6, the capacitances of NiO, Ni<sub>2</sub>CoO<sub>4</sub>, Ni<sub>1.5</sub>Co<sub>1.5</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, NiCo<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> and Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> are 1.1 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>, 1.2 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>, 3.6 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>, 16.8 mF cm<sup>-2</sup> and 12.3 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>, respectively. NiCo<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> exhibits the highest ECSA and thus exposes more active sites for HMF oxidation. We will further demonstrates the NiCo<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> shows the lowest charge transfer resistance by impedance in the kinetic analysis section. In Figure 3d, the catalytic current density from 1.30 V to 1.45 V of each Ni<sub>X</sub>Co<sub>3-X</sub>O<sub>4</sub> catalyst was compared, in which NiCo<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> shows the optimal electrochemical performance.

### HMF oxidation products analysis and catalytic routes

Since  $NiCo_2O_4$  was found to exhibit preferable activity than the other  $Ni_xCo_{3-x}O_4$  family members, thus it is chosen for further oxidation product analysis. According to the fundamental inspection shown in Figure 3b, 1.55 V vs RHE was selected since this potential can maintain the maximum oxidation of HMF and the minimum of water oxidation. Based on the calculations, the stoichiometric amount of charge required to completely convert of the given HMF to FDCA was ~35 C (Figure S7). High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used to detect the oxidation products, through which the intermediates of HMFCA, DFF and FFCA as well as the final product of FDCA were determined during the electrolysis (Figure S8). The conversion/yield

according to different charges are shown in Figure 4a. the yield for the final product FDCA is measured up to 90%, and the FE is between 92% and 99% during five continual measurements (Figure 4b). Based on the calibration curves for the stardand products (Figure S9a-e), the actual values of the products were shown in Figure S9f. The optical images in Figure S7 and Figure S10 show the electrochemical system after electrolysis where the yellowed HMF solution disappeared in the working electrode chamber and bubbles can be observed from the counter electrode (H2 production). Additionally, the carbon balance of HMF during the charge passed presented in Figure S11 further proved the high FE of FDCA.

Here two possible well-identified pathways for conversion of HMF to FDCA has been proposed and shown in Figure 4c. One is oxidation of aldehyde group in priority to form HMFCA intermediate, while the other is oxidation of alcohol group to produce DFF intermediate instead. [15] [8] According to the results of HPLC shown in Figure 4a, during the electrolysis only trace DFF was detected while HMFCA showed a much higher concentration. It is identified that the HMFCA intermediate pathway should be considered as the priority mechanism for electrochemical oxidation of HMF.

#### Kinetic analysis

To further investigate the catalytic kinetics regarding to HMF electrochemical oxidation, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were carried out. Figure 5a displays the Nyquist plots of Ni<sub>x</sub>Co<sub>3-x</sub>O<sub>4</sub> catalysts in KOH electrolyte containing HMF at the potential of 1.45 V vs RHE. Typically, each plot shows a semicircle in the high frequency associated with the charge transfer and a linear region in low frequency related to the diffusion behavior. [16] It is observed that NiO only shows a semicircle without diffusion region, which indicates an intrinsic slow kinetic of NiO (inset in Figure 5a). Subsequently, an equivalent circuit was used for fitting the Nyquist plots (Figure 5b), which includes R<sub>s</sub> (series resistance), Rct (charge transfer resistance), Qdl (double-layer capacitance) and Z<sub>w</sub> (Warburg resistance). All the fitted parameters are shown in Figure 5c. It is found that the crucial Rct follows the order:  $NiCo_2O_4 < Ni_{1.5}Co_{1.5}O_4 < Ni_2CoO_4 < Co_3O_4 < NiO$ . This trend is quite consistent with that of HMF oxidation current density (Figure 3d), which demonstrates the fast ET contributed by NiCo<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>. Although a high R<sub>ct</sub> is observed for pure NiO, it decreases remarkably upon the introduction of Co. The results indicate that Co immigrant can greatly improve the charge transfer kinetic of Ni<sub>x</sub>Co<sub>3-x</sub>O<sub>4</sub> catalysts and facilitate the mass transfer. <sup>[17]</sup> However, the R<sub>ct</sub> increased without Ni (see Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>) which further indicates the synergic functions of Ni and Co species.

#### Stability examination

Generally, upon the evaluation of catalytic activity, cycling durability should be regarded as another significant principle assessing the electrochemical performance. Figure 4b exhibits an advisable FE (92-99%) for five successive cyclic electrolysis, which suggested a fair cycling stability for  $\rm NiCo_2O_4$ . To gain more insights of the catalyst nature, variation of compositions and structure of the  $\rm NiCo_2O_4$  catalyst were further examined after five cycle electrolysis tests. SEM images depicted in Figure 6 revealed a preserved nanowire array structure. The elemental mapping further indicated a uniformly distribute of Ni, Co and O elements.

Figure 7. (a-c) XPS spectrum of the Co2p (a, b), Ni 2p (c, d) and O1s (e, f) of NiCo2O4 before and after cyclic electrolysis

The XPS spectroscopy was used to further explore the valence state variation of the NiCo<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> before and after cyclic electrolysis. where high-resolution Co2p, Ni2p and O1s spectrum are mainly examined (Figure 7). The Co2p spectra can be fitted into two types, Co2p<sub>3/2</sub> and Co2p<sub>1/2</sub> both including Co<sup>2+</sup> and Co<sup>3+</sup> species (Figure 7a). There are no apparent differences observed before and after reaction, which suggests the invariability for the Co valence state. Similar to Co2p, the Ni2p spectra can also be fitted mainly into Ni2p<sub>3/2</sub> and Ni2p<sub>1/2</sub> where both Ni<sup>2+</sup> and Ni<sup>3+</sup> are found only exist in the fresh NiCo<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (Figure 7b). However, the Ni<sup>2+</sup> components were not detected after electrolysis, which indicates that all of Ni<sup>2+</sup> were converted into Ni<sup>3+</sup> after electrolysis. This valence state change further suggests that the Ni<sup>3+</sup> or even higher valence state Ni content might serve as the real HMF catalytic site, which has been reported in previous Ni-based electrocatalyst for water oxidation. [10c, 18]

For the O1s spectra, three main components were fitted including O1 band at 529.3 eV, O2 band at 531.1 eV and O3 band at 532.5 eV (Figure 7c). The O1 band is ascribed to metal-oxygen bond and the O2 band represents the oxygen in OH- groups. [19] The O3 band is due to some oxygen ions in low coordination or physi- and chemisorbed water at the surface. [19] It is found that the O1 band decreases significantly while O2 band increases after electrolysis. This result demonstrates that the metal-oxygen bond was converted into metal oxyhydroxide. In combination with the Ni2p spectra, it can be speculated that the Ni-O bond was transformed into Ni-OOH bond, which further supports the active site of Ni<sup>3+</sup> or higher Ni species for oxidation HMF into FDCA. <sup>[20]</sup> It should be noted that Co should play a synergic role associated with Ni toward HMF oxidation although no apparent changes were observed. The introduction of Co might change the electronic structure of Ni, which is similar to the Fe to improve the water oxidation sufficiently for Ni based oxyhydroxides. [21] Overall, these investigations confirmed the favorable stability property of NiCo<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> catalyst. Ni species should act as the active sites while Co plays a synergic function.

### **Conclusions**

In summary, a series of hierarchical  ${\rm Ni_xCo_{3-x}O_4}$  nanostructures have been synthesized and applied as electrocatalysts for HMF oxidation. All the catalysts exhibit considerable activities and the introduction of Co initiated significant improvement in the catalytic kinetics. At the appropriate doping level,  ${\rm NiCo_2O_4}$  nanowires exhibited the best performances of nearly 90% FDCA yield, 100% FE and satisfactory stability. Such Ni-Co based electrocatalysts open a promising prospective for biomass and chemical energy conversion in an economic and green approach.

### **Experimental Section**

### Materials and chemicals

5-Hydroxymethyl-2-furaldehyde (99%), 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furancarboxylic acid (98%) were purchased from Shanghai Shuya Corp. 2,5-Difoemyfuran (98%), 2,5-Furandicarboxylic acid (98%), Ni(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>· 6 H<sub>2</sub>O (98%) and Co(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>· 6 H<sub>2</sub>O (98%) were obtained from Aladdin. CO(NH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub> was bought from Alfa, and NH<sub>4</sub>F was got from Beijing Chemical Reagent Corp. Nickel foam was purchased from Shenzhen Green and Creative Environmental Science and Technology Co., Ltd. Deionized water (DI water, 18 M $\Omega$  cm $^{-1}$ ) was purified through a Millipore system. All the chemicals used in the experiments were at least of analytical grade and were used without further purification.

### Physical characterizations

X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was performed on a at D8 Advance (Bruker) system using Cu K $\alpha$  radiation resource ( $\lambda$ =1.54 angstrom). The chemical states were investigated by the ESCALAB MKII X-ray photoelectron spectrometer using monochromated AI K $\alpha$  X-ray. The morphology was acquired by using an XL 30 ESEM FEG field emission system operating at 10 KV, and an energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) attachment was used to obtain the surface element composition of synthesized samples.

Synthesis of Ni<sub>x</sub>Co<sub>3-x</sub>O<sub>4</sub> catalysts

A facile hydrothermal process was employed for synthesis of NixCo3 <sup>x</sup>O<sup>4</sup> nanostructures with different morphologies on the nickel foam substrate. Typically, Ni foam (1 cm × 3cm) was cleaned by sonication sequentially in acetone, 3 M HCl, DI water, and ethanol for 15 min each before use. Taking NiCo2O<sup>4</sup> nanowires as example, 1mmol of Ni(NO3)2· 6 H2O, 2mmol of Co(NO3)2· 6 H2O, 6 mmol of NH4F and 15 mmol of urea were dissolved into 36 mL of ultra-pure water, followed by vigorous stirring at room temperature for hours until a uniform solution was obtained. Subsequently, the solution and preprocessed Ni foam were transferred into a Teflon-lined stainlesssteel autoclave and kept at 120 <sup>o</sup>C for 12h. After naturally cooled to room temperature, the Ni foam was taken out and rinsed thoroughly with DI water and ethanol successively several times under the assisted of ultrasound. The self-supported NF/NiCo-precursor was then dried in a vacuum oven at 60 <sup>o</sup>C for 8 h, and subsequently annealed at 350 <sup>o</sup>C in Ar atmosphere for 2 h to achieve the final nanostructure. For comparison, a series of NixCo3-xO<sup>4</sup> candidates were synthesized by tuning the feeding molar ration of Ni(NO3)2· 6 H2O and Co(NO3)2· 6 H2O to 1:0, 2:1, 1:1, 1:2 and 0:1, with the corresponding products marked as NiO, Ni2CoO4, Ni1.5Co1.5O4, NiCo2O<sup>4</sup> and Co3O4, respectively.

#### **Electrochemical experimental**

Electrochemical measurements were all performed with a CHI 920e electrochemical analyzer (CH Instruments, Inc, Shanghai). All the tests in the three-electrode cell were carried out in a divided cell with NF/NixCo3 <sup>x</sup>O<sup>4</sup> as working electrode, saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as reference electrode and a carbon rod as the counter electrode, respectively. LSV was measured with the scan rate of 2 mV/s in the electrolyte of 0.1 M KOH with and without 10 mM organic substrate. iR compensation was used to corrected the LSV data, which determined by a CHI 920e via the resistance test. All the data were presented relative to a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). The conversion between potential versus SCE and RHE should refer to the followed equation:

$$E (vs RHE) = E (vs SCE) + 0.059 \times pH$$

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed using a Solartron 1255B Frequency Response Analyzer (Solartron Inc., UK) at a bias potential of 1.45V vs RHE with AC amplitude of 10 mV. The impedance spectra were recorded in a range of frequency from 100 kHz to 0.01 Hz.

#### **HPLC analysis of the oxidation products**

The electrocatalytic oxidation of HMF based on the three-electrode reaction was performed in a divided-cell with a gentle stir under potential of 1.55 V vs RHE. 10 µL of the electrolyte was extracted and diluted to 500 µL with DI water. The sample solution was then analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (Agilent) using a UV detector set at 265 nm and a waters-organic acid column. The analysis was obtained under the following condition: mobile phase 5 mM H2SO4; flow rate 0.5 mL min-1 ; column temperature 333 K. The identification and quantification of the oxidation products were calculated by the external standard

calibration curve method, those standards were pure component with a known concentration. The conversion of HMF (%) and yield (%) of the oxidation products were calculated as following:

HMF consumed (%) = 
$$\frac{\text{mol of } \text{HMF } \text{consumed}}{\text{mol of } \text{initial } \text{HMF}} \times 100$$
  
yield of product (%) =  $\frac{\text{mol of } \text{product formed}}{\text{mol of } \text{initial } \text{HMF}} \times 100$ 

The Faradaic efficiency of FDCA was calculated using the equation:

FE (%) = 
$$\frac{mol\ of\ FDCA\ formed}{total\ charge\ passed/(F\times6)} \times 100$$

where F is the Faraday constant (96,485 C mol-1 ).

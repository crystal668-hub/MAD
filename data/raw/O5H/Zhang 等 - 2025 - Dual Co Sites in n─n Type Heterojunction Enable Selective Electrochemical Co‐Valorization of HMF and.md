**Abstract:** Electrocatalytic oxidation of biomass-derived hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) and electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 into CO are two highly investigated areas. Efficient electrocatalytic system design that combines CO2 valorization with biomass upgrading offers a viable solution to produce high-value chemicals and renewable energy at the same time. Here, we demonstrate an interfacial-engineered CoS/Co─N─C n─n type heterojunction featuring unique dual Co sites and strong built-in electric field (BEF) effects, which enables efficient electrochemical coupling of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation reaction (HMFOR) and CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). The optimized catalyst achieves exceptional performance metrics, i.e., a record-low onset potential of 1.12 V (versus RHE), with 99% selectivity and 98.2% faradaic efficiency (FE) for 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) in HMFOR, coupled with 98.6% CO2─to─CO selectivity and the FE average was retained 98.4% in CO2RR, which outperform the previously reported state-of-the-art electrocatalysts. Moreover, the integrated HMFOR//CO2RR system demonstrates impressive stability over 50 h continuous operation. Through systematic experimental examination and theoretical calculations, we reveal that the BEF boosts the formation of the unique dual Co coordination environments (Co─N4 electron-deficient and Co─S electron-rich configurations) through modulation of charge transport dynamics, facilitating HMF activation through \*OH intermediate stabilization while promoting multi-electron CO2 reduction via charge accumulation. This work establishes a blueprint for developing multi-functional catalytic architectures that address the thermodynamic and kinetic challenges in coupled electrochemical systems, advancing the frontier of sustainable electrosynthesis technologies.

*E*lectrocatalytic oxidation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA), a pivotal monomer for the production of poly(ethylene 2,5 furandicarboxylate) for replacing petroleum-derived polyethylene terephthalate, represents a critical pathway toward sustainable polymer production.[\[1–7\]](#page-10-0) Nevertheless,

sites to simultaneously drive both reactions with high selectivity and durability, thereby unlocking the full potential of this sustainable dual-functional platform.

Heterojunction is an interface structure formed by two or more semiconductor materials with different properties, which not only maintains the inherent advantages of the original components but also introduces or enhances other characteristics, thus showing significant advantages and application potential as a high-performance electrocatalyst in many fields.[31-35] Building heterojunctions allows for the efficient promotion of electron rearrangement at the interface for further increasing electrocatalytic stability and activity. [36,37] Among them, n—n type heterojunction is formed by coupling a semiconductor with another semiconductor, the difference in Fermi level between the semiconductors can boost spontaneous electron migration at the interface.[38,39] Moreover, the n-n type heterojunction with giant builtin electric field (BEF) greatly accelerates electron transfer, and also improves its catalytic performance by generating more active sites with ultrahigh charge migration. [40,41] However, most systems are inefficient, the oxygen-vacancy-rich indium oxyhydroxide (InOOH-O<sub>V</sub>) catalyst reported by Ye's groups<sup>[42]</sup> demonstrates bifunctional catalytic capabilities, its practical implementation remains constrained by suboptimal energy utilization efficiency, and a single active site of some electrocatalysts may not be able to meet both the CO<sub>2</sub>RR and the HMFOR.<sup>[43]</sup> Therefore, designing a novel n—n type heterojunction electrocatalyst with spatially similar dual active sites is an urgent need to realize the effective electrochemical coupling of biomass valorization with CO<sub>2</sub> conversion.

In this article, we report an interfacial-engineered CoS/Co-N-C n-n type heterojunction, which is constructed by loading S-modified Co nanoparticles onto hollow Co-N-C polyhedra, generating a strong BEF that accelerates electron transfer. Combined experimental and theoretical analyses reveal that Co-N<sub>4</sub> sites drive efficient HMF oxidation, while Co–S coordination promotes CO<sub>2</sub> reduction. This synergistic design highlights dual-active-site catalysis through tailored electronic modulation. The catalysts exhibit ultrahigh activity toward HMFOR, reaching 100 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> with a very low onset potential of only 1.12 V (versus RHE), and achieving a FE of up to 98.2% and excellent cycling stability toward HMF at a low voltage of 1.44 V within 2 h. In addition, the catalyst also showed outstanding performance on the reduction side, with 98.6% selectivity for  $CO_2$ -to-CO at -0.54 V. Furthermore, stability test results for 50 h show almost no performance degradation. Inspired by the excellent performance of CO<sub>2</sub>RR and HMFOR, the integrated two-electrode electrolyzer achieves a current density of 50 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> at a low voltage only 1.671 V and a high durability of more than 50 h. This work provides a cuttingedge design solution for the sustainable and high-value utilization of biomass and CO<sub>2</sub>.

CoS/Co-N-C n-n type heterojunction is synthesized by a simple pyrolysis and hydrothermal process (Figure 1a). Through epitaxial growth, ZIF-67 is uniformly deposited on the ZIF-8 surface for forming ZIF-8@ZIF-67 composite. Pyrolysis of the ZIF-8@ZIF-67 composite yields a Co-N-C framework, where metal ions, i.e., Co, are installed in a

nitrogen-doped carbon network, creating highly efficient Co active sites. Then, by introducing S into the system via hydrothermal synthesis, CoS nanoparticles are decorated onto the Co–N–C framework.<sup>[44]</sup> This process achieves the synergistic regulation of sulfides and the nitrogen-doped carbon substrate, further enhancing the structural stability and functionality of the material. The resulting CoS/Co–N–C composite forms an n–n type heterojunction at the interface. The designed CoS/Co–N–C n–n type heterojunction facilitates charge separation by modulating the electron transfer pathway, providing an effective strategy for developing promising electrocatalysts for further integrated CO<sub>2</sub>RR and HMFOR processes.

This study also investigates the interfacial characteristics and spatial charge distribution of the Co-N-C/CoS heterojunction (Figure 1b) through using UV-vis absorption spectroscopy and Mott-Schottky (M-S) analysis. Figure S1 displays positive slopes in M-S plots, confirming the n-type semiconductor behaviors of Co-N-C and CoS, with flatband  $(E_{\rm fb})$  potentials at 0.25 and 0.33 V, corresponding to vacuum energy levels of -4.75 and -4.83 eV. This implies a 0.2 V difference between the conduction band potential  $(E_{\rm c})$  and the Fermi level  $(E_{\rm f})$  in n-type semiconductors.<sup>[45]</sup> The  $E_c$  values were calculated as -4.55 eV for Co-N-C and -4.63 eV for CoS. Tauc plots (Figure S2) revealed that the bandgap ( $E_g$ ) energies of Co-N-C and CoS were 2.63 and 3.07 eV, respectively, and the valence band potentials  $(E_v)$ were determined through the relationship  $E_g = E_c - E_v$ , which gives  $E_v$  7.18 and 7.7 eV, respectively, enabling complete band structure construction. The Fermi level discrepancy  $(\Delta E_{\rm f})$  between Co-N-C and CoS in a non-contact state drives spontaneous electron (e<sup>-</sup>) migration from Co-N-C to CoS, resulting in the formation of Co-N-C holes (h<sup>+</sup>) until Fermi level alignment, inducing interfacial band bending and generating a robust space charge region with BEF. The strong BEF formed between Co-N-C and CoS will improve the conductivity and the electron transfer, and significantly adjust the surface electronic structure of Co-N-C and CoS. The ultraviolet photoelectron spectrometer (UPS) test results of the materials Co-N-C and CoS is shown in Figure S3. The calculated work functions ( $\Phi$ ) of Co–N–C and CoS are 3.83 and 5.01, respectively, leading to electron transfer from Co-N-C to CoS.[46,47] Meanwhile, we also employed advanced Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) and fs-TAS spectroscopy technologies to further explore the electron transfer pathways. The surface potential difference between these materials also directly proves the existence of BEF and illustrates the BEF strength. [48] Under dark conditions, the surface potential difference  $\Delta E$  between the electrocatalytic material Co-N-C and CoS is 40 mV (Figure S4). This phenomenon is caused by the accumulation of electrons on the surface of CoS.[49-52] It is notable that CoS/Co-N-C (19.7 ps) has a shorter lifetime than Co-N-C (21.6 ps). In other words, when CoS/Co-N-C is formed, there are fewer remaining electrons in Co-N-C, resulting in a reduction in the corresponding lifetime (Figure S5). This can be attributed to the interfacial electron transfer from Co-N-C to CoS.[53-55] The above results confirm that the electrons are transferred from Co-N-C to CoS. Moreover, it also enhances

the adsorption of reaction intermediates in the charge active central site. All of these merits are particularly beneficial for improving the electrocatalytic activities of HMFOR and CO2RR.

High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) images (Figures [2a](#page-3-0) and S6) illustrate the heterogeneous crystalline structure of CoS/Co─N─C composites, featuring lattice fringes corresponding to CoS (101) planes, metallic Co (111) and graphitic carbon (002), clear lattice fringes and the interface between CoS and Co─N─C without obvious amorphous area confirmed the formation of heterojunction of CoS/Co─N─C.[\[56\]](#page-11-0) Elemental mapping (Figure [2b\)](#page-3-0) demonstrates homogeneous dispersion of Co, N, and S without aggregation. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns (Figure [2c](#page-3-0) and S7) confirm face-centered cubic metallic Co (PDF#15–0806) and phase-pure CoS (PDF#19–0366), with attenuated Co peaks in CoS/Co─N─C verifying successful composite formation. Raman spectra (Figure S8) exhibit characteristic D/G bands with an elevated ID/IG ratio (0.92) in CoS/Co─N─C compared to CoS (0.82) and Co─N─C (0.84), suggesting an increase in defect density within the carbon framework upon formation of the heterojunction, while the 668 cm−<sup>1</sup> A1g mode confirms CoS integration.[\[57,58\]](#page-11-0) The surface chemical valence states for all elements were investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The survey spectra show the presence of Co, N, C, and S signals (Figure **S9**). The Co 2p high-resolution peaks for located at ≈ 779.2/793.5 eV and 782.1/797.6 eV (Figure [2d\)](#page-3-0) are assigned to Co3<sup>+</sup> and Co<sup>2</sup>+, respectively.[\[59\]](#page-11-0) N 1s spectra (Figure [2e\)](#page-3-0) disclose pyridinic, Co-coordinated, pyrrolic, and graphitic nitrogen species,[\[60\]](#page-11-0) while S 2p signals at 162.2– 163.8 eV confirm S2<sup>−</sup> species with minor surface oxidation (168.95 eV, Figure S10).[\[61–63\]](#page-11-0) As for CoS/Co─N─C, the peaks of both Co3<sup>+</sup> and Co2<sup>+</sup> shift to lower binding energy relative to Co─N─C and CoS (Figure S11), suggesting the injection of electrons from the carbon carrier into Co atoms increases the electron density of Co, and the enhanced shielding effect leads to a decrease in the binding energy.[\[64\]](#page-11-0) These structural and electronic modifications collectively enhance the electrocatalytic performance of the prepared materials.[\[65–67\]](#page-11-0)

To elucidate the atomic-level coordination and electronic configuration of Co species in the CoS/Co─N─C, systematic X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) were 15213757, 2025, 37, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ange.202511448 by University Of Science, Wiley Online Library on [05/01/2026].

exhibited alongside wavelet transform (WT) diagnostics. The normalized Co K-edge XANES profiles (Figure 2f) reveal CoS/Co-N-C exhibits an absorption edge energy intermediate between Co-N-C and divalent CoS (Figure \$12), signifying a mixed oxidation state of Co species, [68] indicative of a strong interaction with electron redistribution between Co-N-C substrates and CoS molecules in CoS/Co-N-C. Strikingly, Fourier transform (FT) k<sup>3</sup>-weighted EXAFS (FT-EXAFS) spectrum (Figure 2g) shows that the peak of the CoS/ Co-N-C sample is located at the main 1.59 Å (due to the existence of Co-N and Co-S coordination), while there is a small peak at 2.68 Å, which is Co—Co coordination. It indicates that there is a small amount of metallic Co in CoS/ CO-N-C, and this result is consistent with the characteristic peak of metallic Co in the XRD pattern of CoS/ CO-N-C. Since the peak of Co-S (1.68 Å) is similar to that of Co–N (1.59–Å) ( $\Delta R = 0.09$  Å), EXAFS fitting (Figure 2h) further quantifies the coordination numbers as 3.8 for Co-N<sub>4</sub> moieties and 5.8 for Co-S linkages (Table S1), revealing Co dual active sites configuration. The wavelet transform (WT) analysis (Figure 2i) provides atomic-scale spatial resolution: Distinct WT maxima at  $K = 7.6 \text{ Å}^{-1}$  (Co–S) and 10.5 Å<sup>-1</sup> (Co-N) in CoS/Co-N-C closer to the 8.1 Å<sup>-1</sup> signature of metallic Co, conclusively demonstrating the simultaneous presence of Co-N<sub>4</sub> sites and Co-S coordination motifs.<sup>[69]</sup> This heterogeneous integration of atomic-scale Co-N<sub>4</sub> centers, S-coordinated Co nodes, and metallic Co nanoclusters establishes a multifunctional catalytic system, where the synergistic interplay between distinct Co active sites, each with tailored electronic (Co-N<sub>4</sub> electron-deficient and Co-S

electron-rich configurations) states enhances electrocatalytic cooperativity.

We used a classical three-electrode system to evaluate the electrocatalytic properties of HMFOR with 1 M KOH and 10 mM HMF electrolyte. Figure 3a displays the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves of the CoS/Co-N-C n-n type heterojunction with and without HMF. The results show that CoS/Co-N-C as a catalyst can reach 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> with 1.14 V in an electrolyte containing 10 mM HMF and reach 100 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> with a small potential of 1.343 V. It should be noted oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is the main competing reaction in HMFOR, and the results of electrolytes without HMF were also analyzed. The results show that 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> at 1.332 V and 100 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> at 1.686 V, which indicate that the oxidation of HMF is much easier than OER. The electrocatalytic oxidation activity of benchmark Co-N-C and CoS was subsequently investigated (Figure 3b). In the electrolyte containing 10 mM HMF, the satisfactory CoS/Co-N-C catalyst exhibits the lowest onset potential (1.12 V), which is much lower than that of the catalyst Co-N-C (1.25 V) and CoS (1.3 V). This is because the unique BEF in CoS/Co-N-C can significantly boost the electron transfer for further improving the electrocatalytic properties. The difference in electrocatalytic performance between CoS/Co-N-C, Co-N-C, and CoS also indicates the structural advantage of BEF in HMFOR. The Tafel slope further reveals the favorable HMFOR dynamics of CoS/Co-N-C, where CoS/Co-N-C shows the lowest Tafel slope (127 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>), which is much lower than Co-N-C  $(149 \text{ mV dec}^{-1})$  and CoS  $(155 \text{ mV dec}^{-1})$  (Figure 3c,d). 1521373, 2025, 37, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/ai/o1/0.1002/mgg.202511448 by University Of Science, Wiley Online Library on [05/01/2026].

Meanwhile, the lower EIS obtained by the equivalent circuit diagram of the impedance (Figure S13) further demonstrates that the intrinsic electric field of CoS/Co—N—C promotes electron transfer (Figure 3e). Electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) can be used to characterize the active sites of catalysts (Figure S14a,b). As shown in Figure 3f, the C<sub>dl</sub> value of CoS/Co—N—C was 21.43 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>, which was greater than Co—N—C (3.23 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>) and CoS (1.9 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>). The results exhibited that the ECSA of CoS/Co—N—C was much larger. This indicates that CoS/Co—N—C catalyst has more active sites than CoS and Co—N—C, and the dual active sites in its interface structure are the key to HMFOR and mainly exist in the coordination form of Co—N<sub>4</sub> and Co—S. For the

convenience of comparison, CoS/Co–N–C catalyst exhibits lower Tafel and higher impedance (Figure S14d,e), larger impedance arc radius, and lower ECSA (Figure S14f) without HMF.

Because hydroxyl and aldehyde groups co-exist in HMF molecules, there are two possible pathways for the HMFOR (Figure \$15). Specifically, different intermediates, 2,5-diformylfuran (DFF) and 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furancarboxylic acid (HMFCA), can be derived from the HMF molecules, and then the DFF or HMFCA is oxidized to 2-formyl-5-furancarboxylic acid (FFCA). Eventually, FFCA is oxidized to FDCA. Potentiostatic electrolysis at 1.44 V versus RHE was conducted to probe the

HMFOR mechanism. Quantitative high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis of periodically sampled electrolytes revealed progressive HMF decrease and FDCA accumulation with increasing charge input (Figure 3g,h). Accurate quantification was guaranteed by calibration curves made from five-point standard solutions (Figure S16). The theoretical charge requirement (69 C) for complete HMFto-FDCA conversion (Figure 3i) aligned with electrolyte decolorization (Figure S17). Notably, while the DFF intermediate remained undetectable, HMFCA species were observed, suggesting FDCA formation proceeds predominantly via HMFCA-mediated pathways. The CoS/Co-N-C catalyst achieved exceptional HMF-to-FDCA conversion with 98% yield, 99% selectivity, and 98.2% FE, surpassing benchmark catalysts in performance metrics (Table S2). Stability tests demonstrated less activity loss over five consecutive electrolysis cycles (Figure 3j), confirming robust operational durability. Comparative analysis revealed its superior catalytic activity to existing systems (Figure 3k), positioning CoS/Co-N-C as one of the most efficient HMFOR catalysts.

Owing to the superior HMFOR characteristics of the catalyst, the cathodic reduction capability of the catalyst was also studied. In a 1 M KOH electrolyte, the synthesized catalyst, Hg/HgO electrode, and platinum sheet electrode served as the working, reference, and counter electrodes, forming a classic three-electrode system to evaluate the electrocatalytic reduction properties of CO<sub>2</sub>. Gas chromatography was employed to detect gaseous products. As illustrated in Figure 4a, to examine the activity of the CoS/Co-N-C catalyst, an adequate amount of CO<sub>2</sub> was introduced into the electrolyzer, and the LSV curve was measured. At potentials of -0.018 and -0.48 V, the current densities reached 10 and 100 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, respectively. Conversely, under air conditions, 0.223 and 0.49 V were necessary to achieve the same current densities. The current density of CoS/Co-N-C in a CO<sub>2</sub> environment was significantly higher than in an Ar environment, suggesting that a high concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> enhances reaction participation, reduces energy input, optimizes the reaction interface microenvironment, and improves reaction efficiency and selectivity. To further validate whether the outstanding anodic activity of the CoS/Co-N-C extends to the cathode, the LSV curves of CoS/Co-N-C, Co-N-C, and CoS in CO<sub>2</sub> were compared (Figure 4b). As depicted in Figure 4c, the CoS/Co-N-C demonstrated the lowest potential ( $\eta_{100 \text{ mA cm-2}} = -0.348 \text{ V}$ ), markedly lower than Co–N–C  $(\eta_{100 \text{ mA cm-2}} = -0.486 \text{ V})$  and CoS  $(\eta_{100 \text{ mA cm-2}} = -0.534 \text{ V})$ . Additionally, CoS/Co–N–C exhibited higher CO<sub>2</sub>RR activity across nearly the entire tested voltage range. Notably, as the voltage decreased, the disparity in their polarization curves widened, indicating a gradual inhibition of HER on CoS/Co-N-C and a preference for electron transport to the CO<sub>2</sub>-reduced Co–S active site for product formation. To delve deeper into the kinetics of electrocatalytic CO<sub>2</sub> reduction to CO, the Tafel curve, representing the relationship between the logarithm of current density and onset potential, was derived from the voltage-current density correlation. A well-performing electrochemical catalyst should exhibit a low Tafel slope and high current density. CoS/Co-N-C had a Tafel slope of 167 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>, substantially lower than Co-N-C (258 mV  $dec^{-1}$ ) and CoS (336 mV  $dec^{-1}$ ), confirming the kinetic superiority of CoS/Co-N-C over Co-N-C and CoS (Figure 4d). The EIS curve of CoS/Co-N-C was smaller due to an internal electric field that accelerated electron transfer (Figure 4e). Subsequently, product analysis was conducted, and the collected gas products were analyzed using gas chromatography (GC). Under E = -0.54 V, the products of CoS/Co-N-C, Co-N-C, and CoS were detected within 2 h in a 1 M KOH solution saturated with CO<sub>2</sub> using the I-T method in an electrochemical workstation. The recorded time-current profile indicated that JCO increased from -204 to -198 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, while FE<sub>CO</sub> remained at 98.4% throughout the testing period (Figure S18). The specific products (CO, CH<sub>4</sub>, and H<sub>2</sub>) obtained in the GC are shown in the Figure 4f. Among these, CoS/Co-N-C achieved the highest CO yield (18.05 mmol  $g^{-1}$ ), which was 1.8 times higher than Co-N-C (10.05 mmol  $g^{-1}$ ) and 2.5 times higher than CoS (7.24 mmol  $g^{-1}$ ). Moreover, CoS/Co-N-C has the highest selectivity of 98.6%, while Co-N-C and CoS have selectivity of 89.7% and 74%, respectively (Figure 4g). GC and ion chromatography confirmed CO as the main carbonaceous product of the reaction (Figure \$19). Consequently, the activity, stability, and selectivity of electrocatalytic conversion CO<sub>2</sub> into CO in CoS/Co-N-C n-n type heterojunction surpass those of the recently reported CO2RR electrocatalysts (Figure 4h and Table S3), which reveals that the welldefined BEF synergizes with the unique Co-S coordination configuration to accelerate electron transport kinetics and optimize the Co-S active sites for cathodic reaction pathways.

Compared with CoS and Co-N-C, the synthesized CoS/Co-N-C shows significantly enhanced HMFOR performance at the same current density, and it also exhibits satisfactory CO<sub>2</sub>RR performance. In addition, in order to reflect the unique interface effect of CoS/Co-N-C, LSV curves (Figure \$20) of the OER, HMFOR, and CO<sub>2</sub>RR of the pure NF and EIS (Figure S21) for synthesize a physical hybrid catalyst named "CoS + Co-N-C under the same conditions was researched, structural characterization and electrochemical analysis reveal that the BEF and the dual Co active sites in the CoS/Co-N-C n-n heterojunction are the origin of its enhanced electrocatalytic performance. Inspired by its excellent HMFOR and CO2RR activity, we then use prepared CoS/Co-N-C catalysts as cathodes and anodes. The combination of two ideal half-reactions into paired electrolysis using an effective catalyst can optimize energy efficiency. As discussed above, CoS/Co-N-C displays unprecedented bi-functional electrocatalytic activity and stability for both HMFOR and CO<sub>2</sub>RR, which inspired us to develop an integrated CO<sub>2</sub>RR//HMFOR dual-electrode battery for simultaneous electrocatalysis of HMF and CO<sub>2</sub>RR. The LSV confirms the advantage of CO<sub>2</sub>RR//HMFOR in reducing battery voltage compared to HMFOR//OER (Figure 5a). Impressively, HMFOR combined with CO<sub>2</sub>RR significantly reduces the battery voltage, by contrast, in CO<sub>2</sub>RR//HMFOR systems, respectively, as low as 1.548, 1.637, 1.67, and 1.697 V can achieve the same 25, 50, 75, and 100 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> current density (Figure 5b). Figure 5c is a schematic diagram of our device for electrolyzing HMFOR and CO<sub>2</sub>RR simultaneously. Based on the above analyses, the dual reaction mechanism

of HMFOR and CO2RR on CoS/Co-N-C is proposed. HMF molecules selectively adsorb on the Co-N<sub>4</sub> activity site, which facilitates HMF activation through \*OH intermediate, then oxidize the hydroxyl and aldehyde groups of HMF to obtain the corresponding HMFCA and FFCA intermediates, FDCA product, and H<sub>2</sub>O (Figure 5d). The same applies to the other path CO2 molecules selectively adsorb on the Co-S activity site, and then reduce CO<sub>2</sub> molecules through the intermediate \*COOH to finally obtain the CO product. More importantly, CoS/Co-N-C showed excellent catalytic stability, with no significant performance loss at 1.671 V for more than 50 h of continuous reaction (Figure 5e). The reaction pathway of HMFOR was explored by in situ IR spectroscopy. Figure 5f shows the in-situ spectra obtained at different electrolysis times with a fixed applied potential of 1.44 V versus RHE. The characteristic vibration bands located at 1232 and 1634 cm<sup>-1</sup> correspond respectively to the C-O and carbonyl functional groups. With the increase of electrolysis time, the first intermediate detected is HMFCA, whose characteristic vibration bands are located at 1337, 1395, 1509, and 1558 cm<sup>-1</sup>. [70] With the further extension of the electrolysis time, the 1466 cm<sup>-1</sup> band associate with FFCA decreased, while the 1362 cm<sup>-1</sup> band connect to FDCA strengthened after 14 min, showing a transformation from

FFCA to FDCA.[71] The in situ IR results, combined with HPLC tests, provide solid evidence to support the occurrence of HMFOR along reaction pathway I (Figure \$15). To further study the oxidation mechanism of CoS/Co-N-C, in situ Raman spectroscopy tests were conducted. For the OER process throughout the electrolysis process (Figure S22a, left), the Raman spectral band at 498 cm<sup>-1</sup> is attributed to the structural defect of Co<sup>2+</sup>-OH or the A<sub>1g</sub> stretching vibration mode.<sup>[72]</sup> When the potential exceeds 1.3 V, the  $E_{\rm g}$  bending vibration mode corresponding to the Co<sup>3+</sup>–O bond in  $Co^{3+}$ —OOH appears in the spectrum at 435 cm<sup>-1</sup>. This observation result indicates that active high-valent Co (oxygen) hydroxide species are constructed and generated on the CoS/Co-N-C surface. During the oxidation reaction of HMF (Figure \$22a and right), no characteristic peak of the corresponding Co<sup>3+</sup>-O bond is observed after 1.2 V, indicating that a dynamic transformation occurred between the Co<sup>3+</sup>-O phase and HMF. For CO<sub>2</sub>RR, results show the pronounced bands at -1520 cm<sup>-1</sup> and bands at -1620 cm<sup>-1</sup> (Figure S22b), which are attributed to (bi)carbonate anion desorption and the  $\delta H_2O$  bending mode of adsorbed water on the electrode surfaces,<sup>[73]</sup> respectively.

The red shift of such band at more negative potentials is caused by the Stark tuning effect.<sup>[74]</sup> In addition, from the in situ Raman spectra (Fig 5g), peaks of electrolyte, CO<sub>2</sub>, CO, and H<sub>2</sub>O can be found. The two peaks of  $HCO_3^-$  at -1010 and  $CO_3^{2-}$  at -1050 cm<sup>-1</sup> are found in the 1 M KOH electrolyte of saturated CO<sub>2</sub> gas, [75] while the peak of  $-1980 \text{ cm}^{-1}$  corresponds to the adsorbed CO.<sup>[76]</sup> These results illustrate the reaction pathway of the catalysts. Moreover, XRD and XPS after HMFOR and CO2RR tests analysis confirms that CoS/Co-N-C retained its original crystal phase throughout the electrocatalytic reaction and slight alterations in the high-resolution XPS spectra of Co indicates that the surface chemical state of CoS/Co-N-C undergo subtle changes, demonstrating robust structural stability (Figure \$23). The demonstrated exceptional activity and operational stability of CoS/Co-N-C catalysts address the critical demand for durable electrocatalytic systems in practical applications.

Theoretical investigations were subsequently performed to clarify the underlying mechanisms responsible for the superior electrocatalytic performance and enhanced durability observed in n-n CoS/Co-N-C heterojunction catalysts.

We further investigate CoS, Co-N-C, and CoS/Co-N-C using density functional theory (DFT) calculation (Figure S24). Charge distribution between different atoms can be observed through the electron density cloud (Figure 6a-c). The majority of the electron clouds are concentrated at the Co point, and the electron cloud surrounding the CoS region is significantly denser than that surrounding the Co-N-C region. This indicates the Co point and the electron migration from Co-N-C to CoS are the primary dual active sites of oxidation and reduction reactions. In addition, electrons are redistributed in blue and purple patches on the CoS/Co-N-C interface, representing electron accumulation and depletion regions, respectively. CoS/Co-N-C exhibits an evidently higher density of states (DOS) near the Fermi level  $(E_F)$ in comparison with pure CoS and Co-N-C (Figure 6d). The enhanced DOS facilitates rapid electron transfer during electrocatalytic oxidation and reduction reactions, corroborating the findings from EIS analysis (Figures 3e and 4e). Figure 6e presents the calculated electrostatic potential<sup>[77]</sup> revealing a greater concentration of electrons on the CoS domain relative to the Co-N-C domain, which promotes electron migration from B<sub>Co-N-C</sub> to A<sub>CoS</sub>. This distribution 1521373, 2025, 37, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/ai/o1/0.1002/mgg.202511448 by University Of Science, Wiley Online Library on [05/01/2026].

suggests the CoS/Co–N–C surface may offer an optimal pathway for electron transfer. The work function values are 4.91 eV for CoS and 3.75 eV for Co–N–C (Figure 6f). Within the CoS/Co–N–C interface structure, an intrinsic electric field exists, directed from Co–N–C to CoS. The presence of BEF accelerates the electron transfer, and the low resistance makes the catalyst CoS/Co–N–C participate in the reaction of HMFOR and CO<sub>2</sub>RR more quickly, thus accelerating the overall reaction which further highlights the advantages of the CoS/Co-N–C n–n type heterojunction.

Considering that the material contains a certain amount of Co metal, we exhibited all possible adsorption structural models (Figure \$25). We choose CoS/Co-N-C with lower adsorption energy as the further discussion of the experiment. The standard free energy diagrams for HMF oxidation on the CoS, Co-N-C, and CoS/Co-N-C are displayed in Figures 6g and S26. The rate-determining step (RDS) for HMF oxidation is HMFCA\* to FFCA\*, with an energy barrier of 2.47 eV for CoS/Co-N-C, both smaller than CoS (3.14 eV) and Co-N-C (3.39 eV, the RDS is HMF\* to HMFCA\*). It is commonly accepted that two protoncoupled electron-transfer (PCET) processes are involved in the synthesis of CO from CO<sub>2</sub>RR: first, COOH\* is formed, and then CO\* is desorbed from the catalyst surface. [78] Also following the reaction pathway of CO2RR to CO on the surface of CoS/Co-N-C may be CO<sub>2</sub> →\*COOH →\*CO →CO (Figure S27).<sup>[79]</sup> Figure 6h shows the free energy diagram of the potential-limiting step (PLS) of the CO<sub>2</sub>RR

reaction system, <sup>[69]</sup> where CoS/Co–N–C overcomes a Gibbs free energy barrier of 0.34 eV, which is much lower than the free energy on CoS (1.25 eV) and Co–N–C (1.94 eV). To make the experiment more rigorous, we also conducted directly verify the role of Co-N $_4$  site in CO $_2$ RR or Co–S site in HMFOR in CoS/Co–N–C (Figure S28). On the CoS/Co–N–C–HMF structure, the RDS energy barrier of the HMF-CoS/Co–N–C structure (3.18 eV). The ( $\Delta G$ ) for PLS (CO $_{2ad}$  to \*COOH) on the CO $_2$ –CoS/Co–N–C structure to be 0.34 eV, lower than that on the CoS/Co–N–C–CO $_2$  (0.66 eV) in the heterostructure. Thus, in this electrocatalytic system, Co–S sites preferentially drive CO $_2$ RR, as well as the Co–N $_4$  sites preferentially drive HMFOR.

Based on the EXAFS analysis results, there is a coordination environment at the CoS/Co—N—C interface with dual Co sites, including Co—N<sub>4</sub> and Co—S, thus we further calculate the Gibbs free energy of pure Co—N<sub>4</sub> (111) and Co—S (101) to reveal the real action of catalyst CoS/Co—N—C on the active sites of HMFOR and CO<sub>2</sub>RR. From the perspective of charge transfer, electron transfer from Co—N—C to CoS leads to electron defects at the Co—N<sub>4</sub> site. More electron defects make the Co—N<sub>4</sub> site more conducive to the adsorption of HMF.<sup>[80]</sup> The  $\Delta G$  of Co—N<sub>4</sub> (111) at the determined rate is 2.39 eV, which is much smaller than Co—S (101)  $\Delta G$  = 2.63 eV, which further validates that the Co—S site is not suitable to participate in HMFOR (Figure S29a). Thus, the Co—N<sub>4</sub> site in CoS/Co—N—C heterojunction acts as the active center

for HMFOR. Moreover, electron defects at the Co-N<sub>4</sub> site will inevitably lead to electron accumulation at the Co-S site, and electron accumulation at the Co-S site can provide more electrons to facilitate CO<sub>2</sub>RR, which is a favorable condition. Therefore, we also calculated the Gibbs free energy (Figure S29b) of the reaction site of CO<sub>2</sub>RR, and Co–S (101) only overcomes  $\Delta G$  of 0.34 eV at PLS, which is much smaller than the  $\Delta G$  of 1.43 eV that Co-N<sub>4</sub> (111) overcomes, and it also verifies that the active site of CO<sub>2</sub>RR is Co–S. It can be intuitively seen that the  $\Delta G$  of Co-N<sub>4</sub> (111) and Co-S (101) dual sites act on \*HMF and \*CO, respectively at different determination rates. Based on the above analysis, the BEF in the CoS/Co-N-C heterojunction effectively facilitates the synergistic interplay of dual Co active sites (Co-N<sub>4</sub> and Co-S) through interfacial charge redistribution. Specifically, the Co-N<sub>4</sub> site serves as the exclusive active center for HMFOR, driving organic oxidation, while the Co-S site governs CO<sub>2</sub>RR with a significantly lower reaction energy barrier ( $\Delta G = 0.34 \text{ eV}$ ). This finding offers critical insights for the design of spatially structured catalysts while effectively addressing the inherent limitation of low catalytic activity in single-site systems.

This study unveils a rationally engineered CoS/Co-N-C heterojunction catalyst with unique dual Co sites and strong BEF that synergistically addresses the thermodynamic and kinetic challenges of coupling biomass upgrading with CO<sub>2</sub> valorization. Through electronic modulation enabled by BEF, dual Co coordination environments are realized, including an electron-deficient Co-N<sub>4</sub> configuration and an electronrich Co-S configuration. These environments synergistically regulate the interfacial charge distribution and adsorption energetics. Moreover, electron defect promotes the activation of HMF by \*OH intermediates and realizes a record low onset potential of 1.12 V with 99% high selective HMF oxidation to FDCA, while charge accumulation is used for efficient CO<sub>2</sub>-to-CO with 98.6% selectivity and 98.4% FE. In addition, exceptional stability over prolonged operation (50 h) sets a new benchmark for coupled electrochemical systems. The design of this material optimizes the charge distribution and interfacial electron transfer, which further reduces the energy consumption during the reaction and provides theoretical support for efficient electrocatalytic high-value conversion applications.

To perform Faradaic efficiency (FE) calculations and quantitative investigation of reaction intermediates and end products, 20 µL electrolyte aliquots were periodically removed during chronoamperometric measurements at 1.44 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). To preserve the stability of the chemical species, the collected samples were quickly diluted with 380 µL of 0.1 M HCL solution. The HPLC used for quantitative analysis had a UV-vis detector (230 nm). Chromatographic separation was conducted at 30 °C using an isocratic elution method with a mobile phase composed of 10 mM ammonium formate aqueous solution (A) and methanol (B) in a 90:10 volume ratio (v/v). The separation process was completed within 20 min at a constant flow rate of 0.6 mL min<sup>-1</sup>. Standard solutions with known amounts of reference substances, including starting materials, hypothesized intermediates, and anticipated final products, were used to create calibration curves for precise measurement.

At each potential, the volume fractions of the generated CO and H<sub>2</sub> from the cathodic chamber were measured by GC every 30 min. The selectivity of CO calculation follows the equation:

Selectivity(CO) = 
$$n(CO)/(n(CO) + n(H_2) + n(CH_4)) \times 100\%$$

where n was the yield of products. The CO and  $H_2$  Faradaic efficiencies (FE) were calculated based on:

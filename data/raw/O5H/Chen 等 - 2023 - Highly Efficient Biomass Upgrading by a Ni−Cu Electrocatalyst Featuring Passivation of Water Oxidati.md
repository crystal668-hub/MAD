**Abstract:** Electricity-driven organo-oxidations have shown an increasing potential recently. However, oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is the primary competitive reaction, especially under high current densities, which leads to low Faradaic efficiency (FE) of the product and catalyst detachment from the electrode. Here, we report a bimetallic Ni Cu electrocatalyst supported on Ni foam (Ni Cu/NF) to passivate the OER process while the oxidation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) is significantly enhanced. A current density of 1000 mAcm <sup>2</sup> can be achieved at 1.50 V *vs.* reversible hydrogen electrode, and both FE and yield keep close to 100% over a wide range of potentials. Both experimental results and theoretical calculations reveal that Cu doping impedes the OH\* deprotonation to O\* and hereby OER process is greatly passivated. Those instructive results provide a new approach to realizing highly efficient biomass upgrading by regulating the OER activity.

#### *Introduction*

Polyethylene terephthalate (PET), derived from the petroleum industry, has reshaped our daily life due to its diverse and extensive utilities in every respect.[1] However, the intricate degradability and white pollution brought by PET impel us to search for new biodegradable substituents.[2] Polyethylene furanoate (PEF), synthesized by 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) and ethylene glycol, is a bio-based polymer featuring excellent biodegradability, gas impermeability, mechanical strength, and thermal properties compared to PET.[3] Despite that, PEF suffers a high cost for large-scale applications by the expensive monomer FDCA, the annual production of which still needs to be improved.[4] Fortunately, electrosynthesis serves as an eco-friendly procedure for biomass upgrading operated under milder conditions.[5] Green electricity from clean energy sources can be harnessed as power with little pollution. Accordingly, the electrooxidation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), derived from lignocellulose, offers us a cost-effective way to obtain FDCA by a benign oxidation route (Scheme 1).[6]

HMF oxidation reaction (HMFOR) exhibits a low theoretical potential compared to oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Yet, realizing HMF oxidation still lacks efficient electrocatalysts, especially under high current densities. Noble-metal-based catalysts (Au, Pd, Ru, Pt, *etc.*) have shown low onset potential for HMFOR,[7] but further largescale application is still impeded by the high cost and limited activity. In recent years, catalytic systems based on nonnoble metals have attracted increasing attention due to the ample catalyst varieties, superb activities, and costeffectiveness.[8] Among non-noble metal HMFOR electrocatalysts, Ni-based materials have been widely investigated. The oxidation of HMF relies on the oxidation of Ni<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup>, the potential of which is generally greater than ~1.35 V *vs.* reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), inevitably making OER the primary competing reaction.[9] As a result, the oxidation of HMF under high current densities (*>* 200 mAcm <sup>2</sup> ) would lead to low apparent Faradaic efficiency (FE, *<*90%). Thus, the activity and potential range of HMF oxidation are greatly restricted.[10] Previous works pointed out that by introducing a dopant metal, such as Fe, Co, Cu, Pt, *etc.*, [11] HMF oxidation kinetics can be accelerated by manipulating the electronic structure of the Ni center. Even so, the performance of the catalyst is far from satisfaction. The poor durability of the electrode that lasts for several runs makes it unavailable for practical scenes. Ni Fe layered double hydroxide (LDH) is considered an ideal catalyst with moderate adsorption energy for the adsorbates and exhibits outstanding theoretical HMF oxidation reactivity.[12] However, the intrinsic superb OER activity by the favored O2-evolving kinetics would cause low FEs of the product with elevating potentials.[13] The generated O2 bubbles over the catalyst could block the active sites and induce the detachment of the catalyst from the electrode,[14] which brings inferior stability under strong oxidative potentials.

To broaden the potential window and improve the durability of the electrode, it is vital to inhibit OER activity during electro-oxidations. In this work, we construct a bimetallic Ni Cu catalyst supported on Ni foam (Ni Cu/ NF) for efficient HMF oxidation, and a current density of 1000 mAcm <sup>2</sup> is achieved at 1.50 V *vs.* RHE. The performance of Ni Cu/NF has surpassed most HMF oxidation catalysts reported so far. The introduction of Cu suppresses

the competitive OER process, and thus FEs of FDCA are kept at *>*95% over a wide range of potentials. Ni Cu/NF presents superior stability for a long-term operation without the destruction brought by O2 bubbles, and gram-scale FDCA product powders can be obtained throughout the stability test. Electrochemical tests and theoretical calculations reveal the sluggish OER kinetics for Ni Cu/NF, in detail, the deprotonation of OH\* to O\* species is unfavoured, hence passivating the water oxidation activity. Our work has provided a practical method for biomass upgrading under industrial-scale current densities. Through passivating the competing OER activity, the potential window for electro-oxidations can be broadened, and thus the Faradaic efficiency of the target products will be improved.

### *Results and Discussion*

The Ni Cu supported on Ni foam (Ni Cu/NF) and the reference Ni Fe/NF catalysts are prepared by a facile electrodeposition method, followed by a two-step activatingaging process in KOH solution (see details in Methods, Scheme S1). Figure 1a presents the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves of Ni Cu/NF and Ni Fe/NF in 1 M KOH with and without 50 mM HMF, respectively. Ni Cu/NF shows a small onset potential at ~1.35 V *vs.* RHE for HMFOR (solid red line), accompanied by the oxidation of Ni<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> to Ni<sup>3</sup><sup>+</sup>. The current density of HMFOR reaches 1000 mAcm <sup>2</sup> at 1.50 V, and the potential to achieve current densities of 200, 500, and 1000 mAcm <sup>2</sup> is reduced by *>*200 mV compared to OER (Figure 1b). By increasing the concentration of HMF to 100 and 200 mM, the potentials to reach 1000 mAcm <sup>2</sup> can be further decreased to 1.43 and 1.41 V, respectively (Figure S1). The activity normalized through a double-layer capacity (*C*dl) shows high HMF oxidation performance of Ni Cu/NF as well (Figure S2). In contrast, Ni Fe/NF exhibits relatively worse activity toward HMF oxidation due to its intrinsic high OER activity. The current density merely increases from ~400 to ~600 mAcm <sup>2</sup> in the presence of HMF at 1.50 V. Figure 1c and d depict the evolution of Faraday efficiency and yield of FDCA with elevating potentials. For Ni Cu/NF, both values are greater than 95% from 1.40 V to 1.55 V through rapid reactivity and suppression effect of OER process. In the same potential range, significant OER activity of Ni Fe/NF hampers effective HMF oxidation, leading to inferior FEs (from 85.35% to 41.34%) and yields (from 29.55% to 93.50%) of FDCA. Under such conditions, a high product yield at a certain given time could simplify the separation procedure and reduce the ultimate production cost of FDCA, while a high FE enables the availability of the input electric power.

In an industrial-scale related scenario, for more practical use, the current densities for electro-oxidations shall be at least 300 mAcm <sup>2</sup> . [15] Ni Cu/NF shows a superior activity of HMFOR than some previously reported works, especially at high current densities (Figure 2a and Table S1).[9b,12a,16] In a single batch reaction set at 1.45 V, FE and yield of FDCA have reached 99.67 (�0.71)% and 99.51 (�0.38)% based on HPLC (High-Performance Liquid Chromatography) results, respectively. The carbon balance and FDCA selectivity remain close to 100% (Figure 2b, Figure S3–5), indicating the high HMF oxidation rate and negligible HMF degradation in alkaline solution.[12b,17] The reaction finishes at around 40 min with 5-hydroxymethylfurancarboxylic acid (HMFCA) and 5-formyl-2-furancarboxylic acid (FFCA) as intermediates instead of 2,5-diformylfuran (DFF) (Figure 2d, Figure S6). In a strong alkaline solution, the aldehyde ( CHO) group is preferred to be oxidized to

Chronoamperometry (CA) result shows that Ni Cu/NF is robust toward OER for over 50 h, with a high overpotential (~270 mV) performed at 10 mAcm <sup>2</sup> (Figure S7). It demonstrates the intrinsic stability but inferior OER activity under such oxidative potential. After introducing 50 mM HMF, the performance remains almost unchanged over 70 successive cycles (Figure 2c). Both FEs and yields of FDCA stay above 95% throughout the whole stability test. Negligible O2 is generated during this process, which prevents the catalyst from detaching from the electrode. In such a case, current densities decay from ~300 mAcm <sup>2</sup> to nearly zero with the depletion of HMF. All CA curves from the 10th, 40th, and 70th cycles exhibit a similar trend (Figure 2e), indicating the exceptional stability of Ni Cu/NF for HMF oxidation. By enhancing the mass transfer with vigorous agitation, current densities for HMF oxidation can be improved to ~480 mAcm <sup>2</sup> at 1.40 V and ~780 mAcm <sup>2</sup> at 1.45 V, and FEs are maintained over 95% when reactions are completed (Figure S8). Moreover, by collecting and acidifying the electrolytes after stability measurement, gramscale FDCA (4.37 g) can be obtained with an overall yield of 98.3% (Figure 2e, Figure S8c).

To investigate the origin of the high efficiency of Ni Cu/ NF catalyst for HMF oxidation, the structure and surface properties of the catalyst are analyzed. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and transmission electron spectroscopy (TEM) images reveal that Ni Cu catalyst is uniformly covered on the surface of Ni foam skeleton (Figure 3a,b, Figure S9). The catalyst structure keeps robust during HMF oxidation and is well preserved after long-term stability measurement (Figure S10). Highresolution TEM (HRTEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mapping indicate the even distribution of Ni, Cu, and O elements, whereas poor crystallinity leads to unobservable lattice fringes (Figure 3c,d). The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern also confirms the amorphous surface structure of Ni Cu/NF (Figure 3b, inset). The atomic ratio of Ni/Cu is 2.23/1 according to the inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS), which agrees well with 2.40/1 from the TEM result (Figure S11).

The strong diffraction intensity of Ni foam weakens the signal of the supported catalyst (Figure S14). Hence, we

conduct a homemade grazing incident X-ray diffraction (GI-XRD) measurement to investigate the shallow surface of the Ni Cu/NF catalyst by decreasing the incident angle to nearly 0°. The catalyst is activated in 50 mM HMF solution first for the complete evolution of the practical catalytical surface. The results point out the long-range disordered structure concerning the very surface of this catalyst during HMF oxidation (Figure 3e,f),[19] while the bulk with certain depth features slightly better crystallinity (Figure S15), which is consistent with the SAED result. The amorphous surface provides abundant active sites for the adsorption and reaction of reactant and intermediates,[20] thus giving the high apparent activity for HMF oxidation. Figure S16 illustrates the high-resolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectrum of Ni Cu/NF pre-oxidized and rested in 50 mM HMF solution. The oxidation states of Ni and Cu are both over 2+ due to the formation of M-OOH when pre-oxidized in HMF solution. After resting the electrode, the decreased binding energy can be assigned to the formation of Ni(OH)2 and Cu(OH)2, [16a,21] which identifies that the metals with a higher oxidation state are engaged in the reaction, and this will be discussed later.

To further clarify the difference in reaction kinetics for OER and HMFOR, operando electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) test is carried out to reveal the interfacial evolution of the catalyst between electrode and electrolyte. For Ni Cu/NF under OER conditions, the peak located in the middle-frequency region (100 –102 Hz) vanishes at 1.35 V by transforming Ni<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> to Ni<sup>3</sup><sup>+</sup> according to LSV and XPS results (Figure 4a). The characteristic signals of OER start to appear at a low-frequency region (10 <sup>1</sup> –100 Hz) since 1.55 V, demonstrating the sluggish kinetics for O2 generation.[16g,22] In contrast, signals for HMF oxidation can only be observed in the middle-frequency region with synchronous formation of Ni<sup>3</sup><sup>+</sup> species (Figure 4b), where signals for OER are not evident. These results unravel the high HMF oxidation activity and sluggish OER kinetics on Ni Cu/NF with a high nickel oxidation state. However, Ni Fe/NF manifests a similar evolution trend of characteristic peaks with and without HMF at low-frequency regions, implying the strong reaction competitiveness of OER (Figure S17). In situ Raman spectroscopy directly discloses the

formation of Ni3<sup>+</sup> OOH for both OER and HMFOR (Figure 4c,d). A pair of Raman signals referring to Ni<sup>3</sup><sup>+</sup> O vibrations appears at 470 cm <sup>1</sup> and 549 cm <sup>1</sup> above 1.35 V,[23] and that strengthens with potential increasing. The periodic electrochemical tests reveal that the generated NiOOH can react with HMF spontaneously without applying a potential (Figure S18, Note S1).[24] When HMF is present throughout the HMFOR process (blue line), after resting the electrode awhile under open-circuit potential (OCP), signals for NiOOH can still be observed, bringing a small reduction current at 1.10 V. The NiOOH species is reduced to Ni(OH)2 with a lifetime of ~10 min in the presence of HMF, while it lasts for over 5 h without the addition of HMF (Figure S19).[16a,25]

All the above results specify the generation of Ni3<sup>+</sup> species during HMF oxidation, and NiOOH is evidenced to be active in converting HMF to FDCA.[26] The introduction of copper inhibits OER activity, reduces O2 generation, and better HMFOR activity and FEs of FDCA are achieved, especially under high current densities (Figure S20). To further explore the passivation mechanism, Ni M/NF (M=Cu, Fe) model catalysts are electrodeposited with a relatively lower loading amount, hence it reflects more on intrinsic catalytic performance (see details in Methods). For easier comparison, model catalysts here are marked as mNi Cu/NF and m-Ni Fe/NF. SEM images show that m-Ni Fe/NF and m-Ni Cu/NF feature similar ultrathin nanosheets structure (Figure S21). The molar proportions of Fe and Cu of total metals for m-Ni M/NF are estimated to be 10.25�0.16% and 6.45�0.43%. Even if m-Ni Cu/NF holds a slightly higher ECSA value, it still manifests a lower ECSA-normalized OER activity (Figure S22e). The Tafel slopes of m-Ni Cu/NF and m-Ni Fe/NF are calculated to be 84.6 and 26.9 mVdec <sup>1</sup> , respectively. Thus, Cu doping brings a slower reaction kinetic toward OER. The potential for m-Ni Cu/NF to reach 5 mAcm <sup>2</sup> is ~50 mV higher than that of m-Ni Fe/NF by a steady-state CP test (Figure S22f). Those results prove that Cu doping leads to obviously poor water oxidation ability.

Deuterium kinetic isotope effects (KIEs) experiments are carried out to reveal the proton transfer behavior for water oxidation reaction, more importantly, elucidating the rate-determining step (RDS) during the catalytic process. The primary KIEs (KIEs*>*1.5) indicate that proton transfer is involved in RDS or acts as one step affecting RDS during water oxidation.[27] As shown in Figure 5b, m-Ni Fe/NF displays excellent OER activity in 0.1 M OH /H2O, while the performance gets significantly lower in the deuterated solution (0.1 M OD /D2O). The KIEs value is calculated to be ~1.9 over the selected potential range, which specifies

that O H bond cleavage is engaged in RDS during water oxidation. The negative shift of the reduction peak for Ni3<sup>+</sup> to Ni2<sup>+</sup> in deuterated solution also reflects the slower cleavage kinetic of the O D bond than O H bond. A similar phenomenon is also observed for m-Ni Cu/NF, and it shows an inferior activity toward OER compared to m-Ni Fe/NF in both deuterated and undeuterated solutions (Figure 5a). The KIEs value is calculated to be ~2.4, larger than that of m-Ni Fe/NF. It demonstrates the higher sensitivity of the deprotonation process during OER, which is likely to be the rate-determining step.

To study the OER kinetics at the very surface of the electrode, ex situ EIS is conducted in 0.1 M OH /H2O and OD /D2O (Figure S23).[16g,28] Both m-Ni Cu/NF and m-

Ni Fe/NF show slower reaction kinetics in 0.1 M OD /D2O than that in OH /H2O solution. The simulated equivalent electric circuit in Figure 5c further illustrates the kinetic behaviors of solvent ions/molecules over the electrode. The m-Ni Fe/NF features a small charge transfer resistance (*R*ct) of 0.02 Ω in OH /H2O solution, lower than that in OD /D2O solution (0.21 Ω). In contrast, m-Ni Cu/NF displays a higher *R*ct (0.11 Ω) in OH /H2O than that of m-Ni Fe/NF, and *R*ct increases to 0.25 Ω in OD /D2O solution (Figure R23). The larger *R*ct reflects the harder dissociation ability of O D than O H during water oxidation, as evidenced by KIEs results. Also, the mass transfer resistance (*R*mt) is much higher for m-Ni Cu/NF in both OH /H2O and OD /D2O solutions. That means a stronger driving force is required for OH transfer and adsorption for subsequent reactions, and such a process is unfavored over m-Ni Cu/NF, which explains the origin of inferior OER activity. After introducing 5 mM HMF, m-Ni Cu/NF shows a slight change in KIEs during EIS test (Figure S24). The surface of the catalyst goes through a slightly slower deprotonation process followed by reacting with HMF molecules. As for m-Ni Fe/ NF, when it is switched to OD /D2O solution from OH / H2O, the impedance takes an obvious increase (Figure S24). These results reflect the competing OER process and thus a much slower reaction kinetic is displayed.

In addition to the KIEs tests and EIS measurements, density functional theory (DFT) calculations are performed for the qualitative analysis of this catalytic system (see details in Methods). According to the DFT results, Ni sites act as the active sites for OER on Ni Cu/NF, while it favors Fe sites on Ni Fe/NF (Figure 5d, Figure S25, Note S2). The deprotonation of OH\* to O\* is the potential-determining step (PDS) for both catalytical systems. And the theoretical overpotential (*η*) of the PDS on m-Ni Cu/NF (1.02 V) is much higher than that on m-Ni Fe/NF (0.16 V), demonstrating the unfavored O2 evolving process over m-Ni Cu/NF, and consistent with the experimental results. As shown in Figure 5e, Ni active sites are also responsible for HMF oxidation, which follows the HMFCA pathway. The oxidation of HMFCA to FFCA is calculated to be the PDS, and it is also proved by the accumulated HMFCA monitored by HPLC (Figure 2d). In contrast, although the m-Ni Fe/NF has optimized free energy for HMF oxidation, the preferred OER process remains the inevitable competition reaction (Figure S26). Thus, m-Ni Cu/NF is considered a suitable catalyst for HMF oxidation with appropriate kinetic reactivity and inferior OER activity. Additionally, m-Ni Cu/NF exhibits a lower adsorption free energy of HMF molecules, which is the initial step during HMF oxidation (Figure S27).[15] The above conclusions are consistent with experimental results, and both have proved that Cu-doping is efficient in OER passivation, which is the origin of the high FEs of FDCA from HMF oxidation.

During OER process, the very surface of the catalyst is positively charged, and OH ions will be specially adsorbed from the electrolyte to form the Helmholtz layer over the electrode (Scheme 2).[29] The introduction of Cu can effectively impede the charge transfer process in Helmholtz layer compared to Fe, as revealed by the EIS results. Thus, the adsorbed OH will go through a slower kinetic for O H bond cleavage to form the subsequent intermediates (O\*/ OOH\*) during water oxidation that involves electron transfer according to KIEs tests and DFT calculations. Instead, Fe doping possesses a low *R*ct and thus charge transfer is greatly enhanced. Consequently, the accelerated deprotonation and charge transfer processes optimize the overpotential during water oxidation for Fe-doping, while Cu-doping

inhibits OER process and thereby a slower kinetic is presented.

## *Conclusion*

In summary, we have successfully developed a bimetallic Ni Cu/NF electrocatalyst for the oxidation of HMF to FDCA under high current densities. By passivating OER activity, both Faradaic efficiency and yield of FDCA are over 95% up to 1.55 V *vs.* RHE. The catalytic durability of Ni Cu/NF can be well maintained for over 70 successive cycles, and gram-scale FDCA has been obtained with an overall yield of ~99%. Subsequently, through operando EIS and in situ Raman analysis, we found that NiOOH acts as the active site for HMF oxidation, and OER exhibits a sluggish kinetic over the catalyst. KIEs tests and DFT calculations further indicate the sluggish kinetics of OH\* deprotonation to O\* with high overpotential and slow charge transfer ability in Helmholtz layer. Our work suggests that the intrinsic activity of OER catalyst can be significantly passivated by regulating the intermediate step, therefore, electrosynthesis can be achieved with a broader potential window. Inspired by this, we could achieve biomass upgrading in a more sustainable and energy-saving way, which has shown great potential in coupling with green electricity-driven H2 production,[30] CO2 reduction,[31] and reductions of organic compounds.[16a,25]

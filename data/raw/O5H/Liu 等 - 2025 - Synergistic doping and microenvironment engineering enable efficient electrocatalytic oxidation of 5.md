# Synergistic doping and microenvironment engineering enable efficient electrocatalytic oxidation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural

The electrocatalytic stabilization of the 5-hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation reaction (HMFOR) alongside hydrogen production offers an effective and cost-efficient approach to attaining a zero-carbon economy. Nickel-based electrocatalysts are viable options owing to their intrinsic redox properties; yet, HMFOR entails many hydroxide ions (OH<sup>-</sup>) and multi-electron synergistic catalytic mechanisms in alkaline electrolytes. The limited OH- capture capacity of nickel-based catalysts results in diminished energy conversion efficiency. Furthermore, the inadequate intrinsic catalytic activity of nickel and its propensity to reorganize into a single hydroxide at elevated potentials result in aggregation. To tackle these issues, we developed a new catalyst (Co-NiO/Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) employing an approach that integrates heteroatom doping and microenvironment engineering. Experimental data indicate that this catalyst attains a faradaic efficiency of 99.2% and a selectivity for 2,5-furan dicarboxylic acid (FDCA) of 99.17%. The doping of cobalt precisely modulates the coordination environment of nickel, whereas Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> serves as a quintessential Lewis acid, with its surface Cr<sup>3+</sup> sites exhibiting a robust ability to receive electron pairs, thereby accumulating hydroxide ions from the solution and establishing a localized basic environment at the active sites. This work presents an innovative and effective HMFOR catalyst while also proposing a new approach for the design and development of catalysts for value-added biomass conversion.

#### 1. Introduction

Given the pressing global demand for sustainable development and carbon neutrality objectives, the effective conversion and high-value usage of biomass resources have emerged as a focal point of research in green chemistry. 5-Hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) is a biomass platform molecule derived from cellulose, and its electrooxidation product, 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA), is regarded as the optimal alternative to petroleum-derived terephthalic acid.¹ FDCA can be utilized to produce entirely bio-based polyester materials (*e.g.*, polyethylene furanoate), demonstrating considerable potential for applications in packaging, textiles, and energy storage. The oxidation of HMF to FDCA entails multi-electron transfer and the formation of complicated intermediates. Conventional thermal catalytic techniques generally depend on precious metal catalysts (*e.g.*, Pt and Au) or extreme reaction conditions (elevated temperature

The contact between the catalyst and the substrate is essential for heterogeneous catalysis since it dictates the overall reaction activity and product selectivity. Nevertheless, the

and high pressure),2 which present challenges including elevated costs, reduced selectivity, and environmental hazards. Conversely, electrocatalytic technology, characterized by mild reaction conditions, adjustable electron transfer pathways, and the capacity to utilize renewable energy, is regarded as an optimal method for the effective conversion of HMF. The 5hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation reaction (HMFOR) combined with hydrogen evolution can circumvent the sluggish oxygen evolution process at the anode while generating commercially viable products at the anode. This is regarded as a promising environmentally friendly synthesis route with considerable commercial viability. Electrocatalytic HMF oxidation to FDCA can occur via two pathways (Fig. 1a):3 the first pathway entails the preferential oxidation of the hydroxyl group on the furan ring's side chain to an aldehyde group, resulting in the formation of 2,5-furandialdehyde (DFF); the second pathway involves the preferential oxidation of the aldehyde group on the furan ring's side chain, yielding 2-hydroxymethyl-5-furancarboxylic acid (HMFCA). The transformation of a single molecule of HMF to one molecule of FDCA necessitates the involvement of 6 molecules of OH<sup>-</sup> (HMF + 6OH<sup>-</sup>  $\rightarrow$  FDCA + 4H<sub>2</sub>O + 6e<sup>-</sup>).

restricted active sites frequently do not adequately equilibrate the competing adsorption of HMF and OH under alkaline conditions. Stronger adsorption of HMF diminishes OHadsorption, and vice versa.4 Increasing the hydroxide anion (OH<sup>-</sup>) content in the electrolyte can facilitate the HMFOR process; however, in excessively alkaline settings, HMF is prone to polymerization into humins,5 which are insoluble corrosive by-products, thereby reducing the conversion rate of HMF. Consequently, the optimization and enhancement of HMFOR performance can be realized by altering the fundamental environment surrounding the active sites of the reactants. OH-, as a potent base, readily interacts with strong Lewis acids in accordance with Lewis acid-base theory, and the introduction of strong acids can swiftly sequester and concentrate OH-, thus creating a localized alkaline microenvironment. Qiao's team deposited Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> onto CoO<sub>x</sub>, leveraging the potent polarization effect of the strong acid ( $Cr^{3+}$ , with a p $K_a$  of 2.05) to dissociate water molecules and sequester a substantial quantity of in situ generated OH surrounding the catalyst, thereby attaining performance in natural seawater comparable to that in alkaline seawater.6 Jiao's team, by incorporating ordered Cr atoms into Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>, effectively prevented the obstruction of active sites and facilitated the accumulation of OH<sup>-</sup> at the charged interface, thus permitting the efficient production of high-value formates with nearly 100% selectivity across a broad potential range.<sup>7</sup> However, Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> demonstrates limited HMFOR activity owing to its pronounced chemical inertness. Nickel-based catalysts facilitate the adsorption and dehydrogenation of HMF via surface-generated NiOOH active species in alkaline environments.8,9 Nonetheless, challenges include inadequate intrinsic

conductivity and the propensity for individual active sites to congregate, leading to sluggish reaction kinetics and inadequate cycle stability.10 Moreover, single-component catalysts in aqueous electrolytes frequently experience significant and unpredictable surface reconstruction,11 resulting in the formation of a single oxide or hydroxide that tends to aggregate, hence causing a reduction in active sites.12 Consequently, achieving equilibrium between the adsorption and conversion of the organic substrate HMF and OH species, while simultaneously augmenting the reaction activity of nickel-based materials for HMFOR, presents a formidable task that warrants thorough investigation. The solution to the aforementioned challenges resides in the selection of suitable modulation techniques. Diverse techniques, such as defect engineering,13 heterojunction engineering, 12,14 doping and alloying, 15,16 are employed to modify the coordination environment of active sites to improve the reaction rate. Co doping has been demonstrated to augment conductivity,17,18 modulate the electronic structure of Ni-based catalysts, 19 and reveal additional active sites. 20 Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> is frequently employed to stabilize active components owing to its exceptional chemical stability and robust metal-support interaction.21,22 Furthermore, the pronounced Lewis acidity of Cr3+ can augment OH- adsorption and establish a localized microenvironment on the catalyst surface.

However, how to densely and stably combine the highly active components with  $Cr_2O_3$  is a significant challenge. To address the above challenge, this study innovatively designed and prepared a novel Co-doped NiO and  $Cr_2O_3$  composite heterojunction catalyst (Co-NiO/ $Cr_2O_3$ ) using a two-step hydrothermal method, achieving efficient synthesis of FDCA

and long-term stable operation in the HMFOR. Experimental results show that the catalyst achieves a FDCA yield of 98.7%, a faradaic efficiency of 99.2%, and a selectivity toward FDCA of up to 99.17% at 1.4 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (vs. RHE), maintaining over 91.0% of faradaic efficiency after 16 cycles, significantly outperforming previously reported similar non-precious metal catalysts. A series of in situ spectroscopic analyses and theoretical computations confirm that the high activity is attributed to Co doping, which regulates the electronic structure of Ni, enhancing the electron transfer rate and increasing the adsorption capacity of active sites for HMF. On the other hand, Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, as a strong Lewis acid, provides a strong microenvironment for the active sites, enhancing the conversion rate of HMF to FDCA. Furthermore, Cr2O3 shows good chemical inertness in alkaline environments and can serve as an electronic barrier for the active sites, inhibiting the aggregation of single active sites and thus improving their stability. Overall, by stepwise regulating the activity and stability of the catalyst, we not only provide a high-performance HMFOR catalyst but also offer a novel approach for the design and synthesis of new catalysts.

The resistivity of ultrapure water is 18.25 M $\Omega$  cm. Nafion (D520) was supplied by DuPont. All chemical reagents were utilized without further purification. Additionally, the nickel foam (NF) used in this experiment was procured from Beijing Ouhe Technology Co., Ltd. and was cleaned with absolute ethyl alcohol and dilute hydrochloric acid prior to use.

#### 2.2. Preparation of electrode materials

**2.2.1 Synthesis of NiO.** In a typical hydrothermal approach,  $Ni(NO_3)_2 \cdot 9H_2O$  (0.987 g, 4 mmol),  $CH_4N_2O$  (1.212 g, 20 mmol), and NH<sub>4</sub>F (0.312 g, 8 mmol) were added to a beaker, and 60 mL of ultrapure water was added. The resulting mixture was then put, together with a piece of nickel foam  $(3 \times 4 \text{ cm})$ , into a 100 mL Teflon-lined autoclave, which was heated at 120 °C for 12 hours in an oven. Upon reaching room temperature, the mixture was thoroughly rinsed with anhydrous ethanol and ultrapure water, followed by drying in a vacuum oven at 60 °C for 12 hours, and then subjected to calcination at 300 °C in a nitrogen environment for 2 hours.

2.2.2 Synthesis of xCo-NiO. In a conventional hydrothermal procedure,  $5 \times (1 - x)$  mmol (where x = 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4,0.5) of Ni(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>·6H<sub>2</sub>O, 5x mmol of Co(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>·6H<sub>2</sub>O, 1.212 g (20 mmol) of CH<sub>4</sub>N<sub>2</sub>O, and 0.312 g (8 mmol) of NH<sub>4</sub>F were introduced into a beaker, followed by the addition of 60 mL ultrapure water. The resulting liquid was subsequently transferred, together with a piece of nickel foam (3 × 4 cm), into a 100 mL Teflon-lined autoclave, which was subjected to heating at 120 °C for 6 hours in an oven. Upon reaching room temperature, the mixture was thoroughly rinsed with anhydrous ethanol and ultrapure water, subsequently dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C for 12 hours, and finally calcined at 300 °C in a nitrogen environment for 2 hours.

2.2.3 Synthesis of Co-NiO/Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.  $Cr(NO_3)_3 \cdot 9H_2O$  (0.202 g, 0.5 mmol) and Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> (0.143 g, 1 mmol) were introduced into a beaker containing 70 mL ultrapure water and subjected to sonication for 10 minutes. Subsequently, the uncalcined xCo-NiO precursor was added into the solution, and the mixture was transferred to a 100 mL Teflon-lined autoclave. The autoclave was subjected to a temperature of 120 °C for a duration of 6 hours in an oven. Upon reaching room temperature, the mixture was thoroughly rinsed with anhydrous ethanol and ultrapure water, followed by drying in a vacuum oven at 60 °C for 12 hours.

#### 2.3. Electrochemical measurement

A CHI 660E electrochemical workstation was employed to conduct measurements through a conventional three-electrode configuration. A Hg/HgO reference electrode and a platinum foil counter electrode were used in the setup. Prior to formal testing. All potentials measured relative to Hg/HgO were converted to the RHE scale using the following equation: E (vs. RHE) = E (vs. Hg/HgO) + 0.098 V + 0.059  $\times$  pH V. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) scans spanning 0.9-1.6 V vs. RHE were performed repeatedly until stable electrode performance was achieved. Distinct electrolyte formulations were prepared for different reaction systems: pure 1 M KOH solution was used for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) analysis, while the HMFOR studies incorporated 10 mM HMF additive in the alkaline medium.

Electrochemical impedance spectra were acquired under AC perturbation conditions (50 mV amplitude) across a broad frequency spectrum ranging from 0.01 Hz to 100 kHz. To evaluate catalyst surface characteristics, non-faradaic region CV scans at multiple rates enabled double-layer capacitance  $(C_{dl})$ determination via a current difference  $(j_a - j_c)$  versus scan rate plot, followed by electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) calculations using:

$$ECSA = \frac{C_{dl}}{C_s} \tag{1}$$

where a standard specific capacitance  $(C_s)$  value of 0.04 mF cm<sup>-2</sup> was applied. All recorded potentials underwent 95% iR compensation correction. Experimental procedures were uniformly conducted under ambient temperature conditions (25 °C).

#### 2.4. Physicochemical characterization

X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained with a Bruker D8 Focus diffractometer (Germany), utilizing Cu Ka radiation at a scanning rate of  $5^{\circ}$  min<sup>-1</sup> within a  $2\theta$  range of 10–80°. Surface chemical states were investigated through X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) on a Thermo Scientific ESCALAB 250XI (USA), with the C 1s binding energy calibrated to 284.8 eV for carbon contamination correction. Morphological evaluation was conducted utilizing two complementary approaches: an S-4800 system (Japan) was used to generate SEM micrographs and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and imaging were performed with a Jeol JEM-F200 device. To analyze the elemental mapping of the prepared sample, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) was performed using an INCA Energy 350 system (OXFORD, England). Raman scattering data were acquired using a Renishaw RM-1000 spectrometer (UK) configured with 532 nm Ar<sup>+</sup> laser excitation. The local atomic environment was analyzed using X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) experiments performed on a Table XAFS-500 instrument, with transmission-mode spectra processed through Demeter's ATHENA software for valence state determination and coordination structure resolution.

#### 2.5. Quantitative analysis of products

Chromatographic quantification of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural derivatives and oxidation products was achieved through a Shimadzu Prominent LC system configured with UV-Vis detection. Analytical separation was carried out on a Durashell C18 reversed-phase column (Agela, 4.6  $\times$  250 mm, 5  $\mu$ m particle size). During electrochemical testing, 1 mL aliquots were periodically withdrawn from the electrolyte, diluted 20-fold with deionized water, homogenized via ultrasonication, and subjected to chromatographic analysis. The mobile phase combined methanol (component A) with 10 mM ammonium formate aqueous solution (component B) at a volumetric ratio of 7:3, delivered isocratically at 0.5 mL min<sup>-1</sup>. The column temperature was maintained at 40 °C throughout the 15-min separation cycle. UV absorption monitoring was performed at 265 nm for optimal compound detection. Quantitative evaluation of conversion efficiency (Conv.), product selectivity (Sel.), and yield relied on pre-established calibration curves generated from standardized solutions of HMF, HMFCA, FFCA, DFF, and FDCA, calculated using the relationships:1

Conv. = 
$$\frac{\text{moles of reacted HMF}}{\text{moles of initial HMF}} \times 100\%$$
 (2)

Sel. = 
$$\frac{\text{moles of oxidation product}}{\text{moles of reacted HMF}} \times 100\%$$
 (3)

$$Yield = \frac{\text{moles of oxidation product}}{\text{mole of inital HMF}} \times 100\%$$
 (4)

The faradaic efficiency (FE) was calculated using the following equation:

$$FE = \frac{\text{mole of FDCA}}{\text{total passed charge}/(6 \times F)}$$
 (5)

#### 2.6. In situ Raman spectroscopy

The electrochemical cell used for *in situ* Raman spectroscopy comprised a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) casing, platinum wire, and Hg/HgO electrodes. The electrolyte was 1.0 M KOH, with or without HMF, used for HMF electro-oxidation and OER testing. Raman measurements were performed using a Raman spectrometer and an Ar ion laser ( $\lambda = 532$  nm) on a Renishaw RM-1000 instrument from the UK. The instrument was equipped with a  $50\times$  objective lens, with each *in situ* spectrum covering a wavelength range of 400 to 2000 cm<sup>-1</sup>. A continuous potential was applied using a CHI 660E.

## 2.7. *In situ* attenuated total reflectance surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR-SEIRAS)

Surface-enhanced infrared detection under an attenuated total reflection configuration was performed on an FEI IS50 FTIR platform (USA) integrating a VeeMax III ATR module (PIKE Technologies) with a mercury cadmium telluride detection unit. Spectroscopic measurements employed a custom-built threeelectrode system comprising a platinum auxiliary electrode and a Hg/HgO reference assembly. Catalytic layers were deposited on Au-modified silicon ATR crystals through pneumatic spraying, serving dual roles as the working electrode and infrared-active substrate. The electrochemical environment consisted of 1 M KOH electrolyte supplemented with 20 mM HMF. To enhance detection sensitivity, the detector underwent 30-minute liquid nitrogen cryogenic stabilization before initiating chronoamperometric HMFOR evaluations. Synchronized spectral recording (4 cm<sup>-1</sup> resolution, 32 co-added scans per spectrum) accompanied potential application, with subsequent spectral processing involving baseline normalization against reference profiles.

#### 2.8. Theoretical calculations

All calculations were implemented in Materials Studio with the DMol $^3$  code. The Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional of the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) was used to calculate the exchange–correlation energy. $^{23}$  The double numerical plus polarization (DNP) was chosen during geometry optimization. The effect of solvent throughout all calculations was considered. The convergence criteria for energy change, maximum force, and maximum displacement were set to  $2 \times 10^{-5}$  Ha, 0.004 Ha  ${\rm \mathring{A}}^{-1}$ , and 0.005 A, respectively. Long-range van der Waals interaction is described using the DFT-D2 approach.

The adsorption energy  $(E_{ads})$  of species is calculated using the following equation:

$$E_{\rm ads} = E_{\rm (system)} - E_{\rm (catalyst)} - E_{\rm (species)}$$

where  $E_{\text{(system)}}$ ,  $E_{\text{(catalyst)}}$ , and  $E_{\text{(species)}}$  are the total energy of the optimized system with adsorbed species, the isolated catalyst, and species, respectively.

The Gibbs free energy change ( $\Delta G$ ) of a gas phase molecule or an adsorbate on the surface was calculated based on Nørskov's computational hydrogen electrode (CHE) method using the following equation:24

$$\Delta G = \Delta E + \Delta E_{ZPE} - T\Delta S$$

where  $\Delta E$  is the total energy change directly obtained from DFT calculations,  $\Delta E_{\rm ZPE}$  is the zero-point energy change,  $\Delta S$  is the entropy correction change, and T is the temperature which is normally estimated at 298.15 K.

#### 3. Results and discussion

Fig. 2a illustrates that a conventional hydrothermal synthesis process is employed to incorporate a suitable quantity of Co into NiO crystals, resulting in the formation of the Co-NiO precursor. Fig. S1 clearly illustrates that as the cobalt content increases, Co-NiO progressively transforms from a sheet-like to a rod-like structure. A spherical nano-petal heterojunction

material (Co-NiO/Cr2O3) with a radius of approximately 500 nm is synthesized through a subsequent hydrothermal process. The XRD pattern verifies the simultaneous presence of NiO and Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> phases (Fig. 2b). The diffraction peaks at approximately 33.7°, 36.1°, 39.1°, and 44.2° (shown by red triangles) correspond to the (104), (110), (006), and (442) crystal planes of  $Cr_2O_3$ (JCPDS: 74-0326). The diffraction peaks at approximately 20.8°, 52.2°, and 61.3° (shown by blue circles) align with the (200), (422), and (440) planes of NiO (JCPDS: 89-5881). All peaks corresponding to NiO in Co-NiO/Cr2O3 exhibit a minor shift to lower diffraction angles, attributed to the lattice expansion of NiO induced by Co doping. SEM reveals that Co-NiO/Cr2O3 exhibits homogeneous nanospheres composed of sheet-like nanosheets (Fig. 2c). HR-TEM yields intricate details regarding crystal planes, with lattice spacings of 0.217 nm and 0.204 nm corresponding to the (113) and (202) planes of Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, and lattice spacings of 0.241 nm and 0.251 nm corresponding to the (222) and (311) planes of NiO. The inset in Fig. 2d illustrates the diffraction pattern acquired using Fourier transform, revealing multiple distinct diffraction spots that signify the presence of numerous randomly oriented grains (or nanocrystals) with varying crystal plane dimensions in Co-NiO/ Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. This verifies the stochastic distribution of both crystals

within the heterojunction material.  $Cr_2O_3$  is dispersed randomly around Co–NiO, establishing a localized alkaline milieu that enhances the HMFOR. High-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) images (Fig. 2e) exhibit atomic contrast proportional to atomic numbers, with nickel (Ni) displaying the most intense contrast owing to its highest atomic number, thus affirming its significant presence in the heterojunction material. EDX imaging (Fig. 2f–i) reveals a uniform distribution of Co, Ni, Cr, and O elements inside the Co–NiO/Cr $_2O_3$  structure, corroborating the previous research.

XPS was further employed to investigate the elemental composition and electronic structure of the synthesized samples. The XPS spectrum of Co–NiO/Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> reveals the coexistence of Cr, Ni, and O elements (Fig. 3a). Due to the minor amount of Co, no strong signal could be detected on the surface, demonstrating that Co is incorporated into the bulk phase of Co–NiO/Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> via atomic doping. Fig. 3b presents the surface valence states of Ni 2p for various samples. In the Co–NiO/Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> sample, the characteristic peaks at 855.5 and 856.7 eV are assigned to Ni<sup>2+</sup> and Ni<sup>3+</sup> in the Ni 2p<sub>3/2</sub> region, while the peaks at 873.3 and 876.4 eV correspond to Ni<sup>2+</sup> and Ni<sup>3+</sup> in the Ni 2p<sub>1/2</sub> region. <sup>25,26</sup> Moreover, two nickel satellite

peaks are observed at binding energies of 880.51 eV and 862.2 eV in the Ni  $2P_{1/2}$  and Ni  $2p_{3/2}$  regions (labeled as 'sat.').<sup>27</sup> It is noteworthy that the Ni 2p peaks of Co-NiO/Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and Co-NiO shift by 0.5 eV toward higher binding energies compared to NiO, indicating that Co doping affects the valence state of Ni. However, the Ni 2p peaks do not exhibit significant shifts between Co-NiO/Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and Co-NiO, implying that the Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> phase does not undergo electron transfer with NiO. The O 1s spectrum can be deconvoluted into two peaks (Fig. S2), with the peak at 530.7 eV assigned to M-O, and the peak at 531.6 eV corresponding to M-OH, which may be due to the catalyst adsorbing moisture from the air.25 The Cr 2p spectrum can be deconvoluted into four peaks (Fig. S3), with the peaks at 576.5 and 586.7 eV assigned to the  $2p_{3/2}$  and  $2p_{1/2}$  of  $Cr^{3+}$ , and the peaks at 577.8 and 588.8 eV corresponding to the  $2p_{3/2}$  and  $2p_{1/2}$ of Cr2+. To acquire more accurate structural information and chemical valence states, XANES analysis was conducted. As illustrated in Fig. 3c, compared to NiO, the Ni K-edge XANES absorption edge shifts to higher energies, indicating an increase in the oxidation state of Ni, consistent with the XPS analysis. Conversely, the Co-NiO/Cr2O3 spectrum shifts to lower energies compared to pure CoO (Fig. 3d), indicating a decrease

in the average oxidation state of Co. Moreover, EXAFS data reveal the existence of Ni-O (1.49 Å) bonds and Ni-O-M (2.53 Å) bonds in Co–NiO/Cr $_2$ O $_3$ ,  $^{28}$  with M denoting either Co or Ni. The Ni-O bond length in the first shell of Ni exceeds that in pure NiO, perhaps due to octahedral distortion induced by Co doping. In addition, as illustrated in Fig. 3c and d, the reduction in the pre-edge peaks of the Ni and Co K-edges in Co-NiO/Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> unequivocally signifies that Co doping results in diminished symmetry around Ni and Co atoms. Similarly, the Fourier transform of the Co-NiO/Cr2O3 Co K-edge in R-space also revealed the presence of Co-O (1.57 Å) and Co-O-M (2.69 Å) bonds (Fig. 3f). 29,30 Wavelet transform analysis also confirms the existence of Ni-O/Co-O and Ni-O-M/Co-O-M contributions around the Ni/Co atoms of Co-NiO/Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> (Fig. 3i and j). Fig. S4a shows the FT  $k^3$ -weighted Cr K-edge EXAFS spectra of Co-NiO/ Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. The dominant peak at 1.56 Å in the spectrum of Co-NiO/ Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> confirms the existence of Cr-O coordination in the first coordination sphere of Cr<sup>3+</sup> that matches well with Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.<sup>31</sup> The wavelet transform of the  $k^3$ -weighted EXAFS spectrum provides consistent information on the coordination structure, showing a single peak of maximum intensity at  $(R + \Delta R)$  1.5 Å, which can be assigned to the Cr-O bond (Fig. S4b). As previously mentioned, Co doping in the NiO lattice results in the formation of Co-O-Ni bonds, and the electron transfer mechanism can be elucidated based on the electronic configuration depicted in Fig. 3k. The electrical configuration of Co<sup>2+</sup> is high-spin dorbitals arranged as  $t_{2g}^5 e_g^2$ , and unpaired electrons in the lower t<sub>2g</sub> energy level, capable of interacting with bridging oxygen via  $\pi$ -electron interaction. The fully occupied  $\pi$ -symmetric ( $t_{2g}$ ) d orbitals of Ni<sup>2+</sup> induce electron repulsion during interactions with the bridging oxygen, resulting in electron transfer from Ni to Co.32 This process simultaneously reduces electron repulsion within the Ni-O bond, thereby facilitating further electron transfer from Ni to Co, which increases the oxidation state of Ni while decreasing that of Co, which is consistent with the XPS and EXAFS results.

The electrocatalytic performance of the synthesized materials was evaluated using an H-type electrochemical cell separated by an anion exchange membrane in a standard threeelectrode system. As shown in Fig. 4a, compared to the OER at the anode (1.23 V vs. RHE), HMFOR exhibits a lower overpotential, indicating its favorable thermodynamic properties. First, electrocatalytic activity tests were performed with Co-NiO/ Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> at varying Co contents in 1 M KOH + 10 mM HMF. As shown in Fig. S5, the doping of Co clearly enhances the performance of  $Co_x$ -NiO/ $Cr_2O_3$  (x = 0.1 to 0.5). The prominent oxidation peak at 1.4 V  $\nu s$ . RHE is attributed to the oxidation of Ni<sup>2+</sup> to Ni<sup>3+</sup>, and the high-valent Ni is generally regarded as the active site for HMFOR.16,33 As the Co content increases, the oxidation peak shows both an increase and a decrease, indicating the existence of an optimal cobalt concentration. The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves reveal that at a Co content of 0.1, the Co<sub>0.1</sub>-NiO/Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> catalyst outperforms the other catalysts with different Co contents. For simplicity, we refer to the best catalyst as Co-NiO/Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. As shown in Fig. 4b, the HMFOR efficiency of Co-NiO/Cr2O3 is noticeably higher than that of pure Co-NiO and pure NiO. Co-NiO/Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> requires

only 1.35 and 1.40 V vs. RHE to achieve current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. In addition, when the current density reaches 150 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, the potential difference with OER is 300 mV, suggesting that HMFOR on Co-NiO/Cr2O3 is much more favorable than OER. The Tafel slopes corresponding to the electron transfer rates of different catalysts were calculated to explore the electrooxidation reaction kinetics. As shown in Fig. 4c, the Tafel slope of Co-NiO/ $Cr_2O_3$  is 24.6 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>, significantly lower than that of Co-NiO (70.4 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>) and NiO (101.2 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>), indicating that Co-NiO/Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> exhibits a faster HMFOR rate. The ECSA was then analyzed based on the  $C_{\rm dl}$ measured from the CV data in the non-faradaic region (Fig. 4d and S6). The results show that the spherical nanoflower structure of Co-NiO/Cr2O3 provides a larger active surface area, which can expose more active sites and thus enhance the HMF oxidation performance. Following this, the LSV curves for HMFOR were normalized using the  $C_{\rm dl}$  values. Fig. 4e demonstrates that Co-NiO/Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> exhibits higher intrinsic activity. Furthermore, Co-NiO/Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> shows better electronic conductivity and faster charge transfer rates during the HMFOR, as confirmed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements (Fig. S7). The adsorption behavior of HMF in the Helmholtz layer of different catalysts was investigated through open-circuit potential (OCP) measurements. By comparing the OCP difference ( $\Delta$ OCP) before and after the addition of 10 mM HMF in a 1.0 M KOH solution, it was observed that Co-NiO/ Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> (230 mV) exhibited a larger decrease than Co-NiO (110 mV) and NiO (77 mV) (Fig. 4f), suggesting that Co-NiO/Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> has a stronger HMF adsorption ability. Furthermore, we conducted electrochemical performance assessments on both pure Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> samples and Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> physically ground with Co-NiO (named Co-NiO@Cr2O3). The LSV results presented in Fig. S8a demonstrate that, owing to the pronounced Lewis acid characteristics of Cr2O3, it displays a persistently low reaction current in both HMF-containing and non-HMF electrolytes, indicating its limited involvement in HMF oxidation. The Co-NiO@Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> sample exhibited an increased reaction current, with similar currents for both the OER and HMFOR. Highperformance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was utilized to detect and quantify the concentration changes of HMF, intermediates, and oxidation products, with the calibration curve provided in Fig. S9. The findings revealed that Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> exhibits a maximum selectivity of 4.5% for HMF oxidation, indicating inadequate catalytic activity for the process (Fig. S8b). The FDCA selectivity for the Co-NiO@Cr2O3 catalyst post-grinding was 73.3% (Fig. S8c), markedly inferior than the 99.2% selectivity observed for Co–NiO/Cr $_2$ O $_3$ . This further substantiates that the superior electrocatalytic oxidation performance of HMF in Co-NiO/Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> is attributable to the interfacial impact rather than simple physical mixing. By applying various potentials, the relationship between HMF conversion efficiency and potential was explored. Fig. S10 demonstrates that the highest faradaic efficiency of 99.2% was achieved at 1.4 V vs. RHE and the yield of FDCA reached as high as 98.7%, outperforming the vast majority of previously reported catalysts (Table S1). Since each HMF molecule requires six electrons to be oxidized into one FDCA molecule, a theoretical charge of 92.63 C is needed to

completely convert 1.6  $\times$  10<sup>-4</sup> mol of HMF (10  $\times$  10<sup>-3</sup> M HMF in 16 mL of electrolyte) into FDCA. As shown in Fig. 4g, when the theoretical charge of 92.63 C is applied, the HMFOR current drops to nearly zero, indicating complete consumption of HMF in the electrolyte, which then changes from its initial orange color to a colorless and transparent state. In addition, we examined the reaction rate constants to further elucidate the cause of the remarkable selectivity of Co-NiO/Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. The oxidation reaction rate constants for HMF, HMFCA, and FFCA on Co-NiO/Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> surpass those on Co-NiO, suggesting that augmenting the catalyst's surface alkalinity can accelerate the oxidation rate of HMF, thus reducing the accumulation of intermediates and enhancing the selectivity for the target product (Fig. S11). Different coulombic electron numbers were applied to investigate the relationship between the reaction products and the number of coulombic electrons. Fig. 4h shows that as the applied electron count increases, HMF decreases approximately linearly, while FDCA increases in a nearly linear

fashion. Furthermore, HPLC detected small amounts of HMFCA and trace levels of FFCA, but no DFF was observed, proving that HMFOR follows the HMFCA pathway (Fig. S12). The stability of the catalyst was subsequently tested, and the faradaic efficiency remained above 91.0% after 16 cycles. SEM analysis of the samples after stability testing revealed that Co-NiO/Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> retained its spherical nanosheet morphology after 16 cycles (Fig. S13). To further substantiate the catalyst's applicability, we conducted 10 000 CV cycles (Fig. S14a) and a 240-hour constant current test (Fig. S14b). As illustrated in Fig. S14c and d, the catalyst preserved its nanosheet form after 10 000 cycles, thereby substantiating its structural stability. Furthermore, during a 10-day period of continuous current testing in an alkaline electrolyte, the catalyst demonstrated merely a 150 mV potential degradation, so reinforcing its applicability in practical scenarios. This is likely due to the fence effect between different components, which prevents the aggregation of

individual components and thereby preserves the high active surface area of the catalyst.34

Potential-dependent EIS measurements were employed to elucidate the structure-activity-potential link, hence providing deeper insights into the features of the reaction interface. The high-frequency range (10<sup>2</sup>-10<sup>5</sup> Hz) of the Bode plot pertains to the internal oxidation of the electrode, whereas the lowfrequency range signifies charge imbalance resulting from interfacial processes. 35,36 The Bode plot in Fig. 5a illustrates that the phase angle of NiO in the high-frequency region remains elevated when the potential increases from 1.10 V to 1.60 V vs. RHE, signifying that NiO exhibits substantial oxidation resistance, resulting in the formation of high-valent NiOOH. In the low-frequency  $(10^{-2} \text{ to } 10^2 \text{ Hz})$  domain, the phase angle declines precipitously and attains a plateau between 1.40 and 1.50 V vs. RHE, with 1.50 V vs. RHE serving as the inflection point. At this juncture, NiO generates an adequate amount of high-valent Ni to engage in HMF oxidation. Conversely, the phase angle in the high-frequency domain of Co-NiO and Co-NiO/Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> attains its minimum at 1.40 V vs. RHE (Fig. 5b and c), signifying the completion of oxidation reconstruction and the formation of Ni in a high oxidation state. This indicates that Co doping reduces the oxidation potential of Ni. Furthermore, in the low-frequency domain, a minimum value is attained at 1.35 V vs. RHE, with an inflection point at 1.40 V vs. RHE,

signifying the initiation of the HMFOR. A novel inflection point emerges between 1.50 and 1.60 V vs. RHE, signifying the onset of competitive OER. Fig. S15 juxtaposes the Nyquist plots of Co-NiO and NiO electrodes at various potentials in 1 M KOH + 10 mM HMF. The Nyquist plot demonstrates that NiO exhibits a nearly vertical line between 1.0 and 1.50 V vs. RHE (Fig. S15b), signifying elevated charge transfer resistance. Upon increasing the applied potential to 1.55 V vs. RHE, a distinct semicircle appears, signifying reduced charge transfer resistance and an augmented charge transfer rate. The Nyquist plot for Co-NiO exhibits a notable decrease in semicircle radius at 1.30 V vs. RHE (Fig. S15a), demonstrating that Co doping improves the electron transfer rate of NiO, consistent with the Bode plot study. To observe the alterations in the catalyst surface during the OER and HMFOR processes, potential-dependent in situ Raman spectroscopy was performed on Co-NiO/Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. Fig. 5d demonstrates that at a potential of 1.40 V vs. RHE, two peaks at 478 and 550 cm<sup>-1</sup> are observed, corresponding to the distinctive characteristic peaks of NiOOH, 37,38 indicating the creation of high oxidation state Ni. A peak at 851 cm<sup>-1</sup> concurrently emerges, attributable to the oxidative dissolution of Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>,<sup>39</sup> resulting in the formation of Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> that adsorbs onto the catalyst surface. At 1.55 V vs. RHE, the Raman peak intensity of Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> decreases due to bubble formation during the OER, which interferes with the adsorption of  $Cr_2O_4^{\ 2-}$  in the solution.

Fig. 5e illustrates the behavior of Co-NiO/Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> in the HMFOR process, where an adsorption peak of Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> is observed at 851 cm<sup>-1</sup>. At elevated potentials, the adsorption peak of Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> remains pronounced, signifying that no substantial gas bubble production occurs on the catalyst surface to influence the adsorption of Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>, thus confirming that HMFOR remains the predominant reaction. The peak at 1520 cm<sup>-1</sup> is primarily related to the stretching vibration of the carboxylate group.40 Co-NiO/Cr2O3 forms an increasing amount of highvalent Ni at high oxidation potentials, thereby increasing the adsorption of HMF. The peak at 1652 cm<sup>-1</sup> presumably corresponds to the C=C stretching vibration of the furan ring.41 As the potential increases, the peak widens, likely attributed to the formation of C=C containing intermediates (HMFCA and FFCA). It is noteworthy that during the HMFOR procedure, no NiOOH peaks were detected at 478 and 550 cm<sup>-1</sup>. This results from the rapid and spontaneous redox reaction between HMF and  $Ni^{3+}$  ( $Ni^{3+}$  + HMF  $\rightarrow Ni^{2+}$  + HMF<sub>ox</sub>). Ni in a high oxidation state is regarded as the active site for HMFOR<sup>2,11</sup> corroborating other previous studies. 33,42

In situ infrared measurements were conducted at varying potentials to further examine the reaction intermediates. Fig. 5f illustrates that peaks at 1095, 1134, 1140, and 1167 cm<sup>-1</sup> correspond to HMF,43 with a rise in potential leading to a corresponding enhancement in their adsorption strength. The peak at 1569 cm<sup>-1</sup> is indicative of the intermediate HMFCA.8 The HMFCA absorption peak is detected at 1.00 V vs. RHE, attributed to the Cannizzaro reaction. 44 The peaks at 1356 cm<sup>-1</sup> and 1386 cm<sup>-1</sup> correspond to FFCA and FDCA, 45 respectively. No peaks associated with DFF were observed, suggesting that the HMFOR of Co-NiO/Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> follows the HMFCA pathway, corroborating the findings from HPLC analysis. Fig. 5g and h present the *in situ* spectra within the region of  $3000-3800 \text{ cm}^{-1}$ . The prominent peak at 3200–3600 cm<sup>-1</sup> signifies the unbound OH<sup>-</sup> in the alkaline electrolyte.<sup>28</sup> The intensity of the broad peak in the Co-NiO/Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> spectrum is approximately tenfold greater than that in the infrared spectrum of pure Co-NiO. Fig. S16 presents a 2D graphic that elucidates the link between surface OH strength and potential more intuitively. As the potential increases, the HMFOR progressively intensifies, resulting in an increased consumption of OH-and a subsequent reduction in surface OH concentration. Nonetheless, surface of Co-NiO/ Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> exhibits a greater concentration of OH<sup>-</sup> compared to the surface of Co-NiO. The robust Lewis acid (Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) in Co-NiO/ Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> has a significant binding affinity for potent Lewis bases, resulting in substantial OH adsorption on the catalytic surface. This imparts localized basicity that facilitates an increase in the HMFOR rate. To comprehensively illustrate the essential function of OH in HMFOR, we evaluated the electrocatalytic performance of NiO under both KOD + HMF and KOD conditions. Fig. S17 illustrates that the onset potentials are almost equal in electrolytes with and without HMF. Moreover, at elevated potentials (>1.80 V vs. RHE), the performance of HMFOR is subpar compared to OER. Specifically, the HMFOR current density reaches 50 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> at 1.78 V vs. RHE in the KOD + HMF electrolyte, markedly more than that in KOH + HMF (1.38 V vs. RHE). Therefore, isotope labeling

investigations further validated the critical function of hydroxide species in the HMFOR. The HMFOR performance of NiO was evaluated in 1 M KOH and 0.1 M KOH to assess the effect of OH<sup>-</sup> concentration on HMFOR. Fig. S18 illustrates that an increased concentration of OH<sup>-</sup> results in a diminished onset potential, while at lower KOH concentrations, HMFOR reached the mass transfer limit at only 1.55 V vs. RHE. The above observation emphasizes the restrictive role of OH<sup>-</sup> throughout the HMFOR process. Hence, increasing the alkalinity of the catalytic active site environment is advantageous for enhancing the HMFOR.

A theoretical analysis utilizing first principles calculations conducted to clarify the factors contributing to the increased electrocatalytic activity of HMF oxidation by Co-NiO/ Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. Table S2 presents the optimized geometric configurations. Previous structural analysis indicates that Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and NiO do not interact. Consequently, independent computations were conducted for the two models to exclude charge redistribution at the interface due to work function differences. The differential charge density map indicates heightened charge accumulation (blue region) around Co atoms (Fig. 6b). Moreover, we conducted Bader charge calculations on the NiO and Co-NiO models and provided representative local charge distribution diagrams (Fig S19a and b). It is evident that after Co doping into the NiO crystal, the Bader charge of the two Ni atoms around Co decreases by 0.023 and 0.011|e| (yellow font). These results are consistent with our previous hypothesis, implying that Co functions as an electron acceptor in the doped NiO crystal, hence elevating the oxidation state of Ni, in accordance with the XPS and EXAFS investigations. Further estimates of the adsorption energy of HMF on Co-NiO and Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> were conducted (Fig. 6c, Table S3). The pronounced Lewis acidity of  $Cr_2O_3$  facilitates the spontaneous adsorption of OH on  $Cr_2O_3$ , with an energy cost of -4.70 eV, surpassing that for HMF adsorption (-2.31 eV), suggesting that Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> can preferentially concentrate OH in the electrolyte. Moreover, the adsorption energy of HMF on Co-NiO is -4.12 eV, signifying its robust capacity for HMF adsorption and excellent HMFOR activity. Furthermore, the impact of the solvent environment on adsorption energy was assessed (Table S4), yielding results that aligned with the aforementioned trend. We computed the projected density of states (PDOS) to obtain additional insights into the electronic structure of the atomic sites. The PDOS of Co-NiO and NiO are shown in Fig. S20a and S20b. Co doping into the NiO lattice causes significant changes in the electronic structure of Co-NiO. Notably, the PDOS of Co-NiO near the Fermi level is much higher than that of NiO, suggesting that Co-NiO exhibits enhanced charge transfer capacity and electrocatalytic kinetics in the HMFOR. Moreover, the  $d_{Ni}$ -band electrons of Co-NiO are positioned nearer to the Fermi level in comparison to those in NiO as illustrated in Fig. 6d, with the  $d_{\rm Ni}$ -band center of Co-NiO shifting 0.31 eV towards the Fermi level relative to NiO. The  $d_{Ni}$ band center hypothesis is employed to elucidate the interaction strength between adsorbates and surfaces, as the energy level of the d-band center influences the occupancy of the antibonding band, hence determining the stability and strength of the adsorption bond. Proximity of the d-band center to the Fermi

level correlates with a reduction in antibonding electrons, hence augmenting the adsorption capacity of oxygencontaining intermediates.<sup>46</sup> Furthermore, the overlap between the p-orbitals of HMF and the d-orbitals of Ni in Co–NiO is approximately double that in NiO, indicating that Co doping in NiO enhances the orbital compatibility between Ni and HMF. The enhanced coupling of d–p orbital electrons improves the bonding (d) with HMF, hence augmenting HMF adsorption. The electronic disparity along the z-axis of the adsorption system was computed. Fig. 6e illustrates that the charge redistribution predominantly occurs on the surface nickel atoms of Co–NiO and the oxygen atoms of the furan ring side chain. Charge accumulation (Dr > 0) is observed on the surface of Co–NiO, whereas electron depletion occurs on the HMF side (Dr < 0), suggesting that Ni serves as an effective active site for the oxidation of HMF. Furthermore, we optimized Co–NiO with adsorbed HMF and conducted Bader charge calculations. Fig. S19c and d show the Bader charge values of the active Ni site before and aer HMF adsorption. It is clear that the Bader charge of Ni increases by 0.479jej aer HMF adsorption, which agrees with the analysis of the average charge density difference of HMF adsorbed on Co-NiO along the vertical z-direction. In addition, we incorporated free energy calculations to assess the influence of various crystal structures on the electrocatalytic oxidation of HMF. Fig. 6f shows the Gibbs free energy diagram for the most energetically favorable pathway. The ratedetermining step (RDS) for HMFOR was identified, with the dehydrogenation from FFCA to FDCA recognized as the RDS on NiO, with a maximum energy change of 1.98 eV. Encouragingly, the RDS on NiO transitioned to the desorption of FDCA upon Co doping, with the maximum energy barrier substantially reduced to 1.36 eV, signifying that Co-doping modulates the electronic structure of NiO crystals and is pivotal in enhancing HMFOR activity. In summary, Cr2O3, functioning as a potent Lewis acid, creates a robust basic milieu around the active sites, whereas Co doping alters the electronic structure of Ni, hence augmenting the interaction with HMF and increasing its oxidation capacity.

#### 4. Conclusion

In conclusion, we developed a highly efficient HMFOR catalyst via a two-step hydrothermal process. Initially, we optimised the electrical configuration of the active sites using Co atom doping, which improved the electron transfer rate of the catalyst and reduced the oxidation potential of Ni. Subsequently, we synthesised the composite catalyst Co-NiO/Cr2O3 through heterojunction engineering, wherein Co-NiO was intimately aligned with the potent Lewis acid Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. The incorporation of Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> established a localized alkaline milieu around the catalytic active sites. Co-NiO/Cr2O3 demonstrated exceptional HMFOR performance, necessitating merely 120 mV of overpotential to attain a reaction current of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, with a faradaic efficiency of 99.2% for FDCA, and it sustained remarkable stability over 16 cycles. This study combines doping microenvironment engineering, resulting in an outstanding HMFOR catalyst and introducing a novel approach for synthesizing electrocatalysts for biomass upgrading.

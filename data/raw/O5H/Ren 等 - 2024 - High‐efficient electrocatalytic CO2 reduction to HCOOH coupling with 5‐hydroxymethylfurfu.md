# Abstract

Among various products from electrocatalytic CO2 reduction (CO2ER), HCOOH is highly profitable one. However, the slow kinetics of anodic oxygen evolution reaction lowers overall energy efficiency, which can be replaced by an electro-oxidation reaction with low thermodynamic potential and fast kinetics. Herein, we report an electrolysis system coupling CO2ER with 5-hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation reaction (HMFOR). A BiOCl–CuO catalyst was designed to sustain CO2ER to HCOOH at partial current density of 500 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> with FEHCOOH above 90% and 700 mA/cm2 with FEHCOOH above 80%. In situ and ex situ x-ray absorption fine structure was used to capture the structure transform of BiOCl–CuO into metallic Bi and Cu during CO2ER process, and the presence of CuO will promote this transformation which are supported by DFT calculations. Coupling HMFOR with CO2ER, we realize both FEHCOOH and FEFDCA above 95% simultaneously, providing new prospects vista for the electrosynthesis of value-added products from paired system.

# 1 | INTRODUCTION

With the rapid consumption of fossil energy and the increasingly serious greenhouse effect caused by the large CO2 emissions, the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction (CO2ER) driven by renewable resource (such as wind and tide energy) has exhibited great development potential for achieving carbon balance and fostering a virtuous cycle of carbon neutrality.[1](#page-9-0)–<sup>7</sup> Products produced by CO2ER including CO, CH4,

HCOOH and C2<sup>+</sup> products are important fuels, chemicals and industrial feedstocks.[8,9](#page-9-0) Currently, HCOOH has been considered as one of the most promising raw materials for industrial development due to its safety, nonflammability, and its further use in formic acid fuel cells or as a hydrogen storage carrier.[10](#page-9-0)–<sup>12</sup> However, the conventional CO2ER system normally consists of CO2 reduction at the cathode and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode, in which OER usually suffered from the sluggish reaction kinetics due to its four electrons transfer process, causing significant energy consumption and greatly Jing Ren, Zixian Li, and Chenjun Ning contributed equally to this study. limiting improvements in electrolysis efficiency.

utilization, replacing OER with organic molecules (such as urea,[13](#page-9-0) methane,[14](#page-9-0) sulfion,[15](#page-9-0) methanol,[16,17](#page-9-0) benzyl alcohol[,18](#page-9-0) polyethylene terephthalate[,19](#page-9-0) glycerol[,20](#page-9-0) and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural [HMF][21\)](#page-9-0) for electro-oxidation to produce high-value-added products has been regarded as a promising alternative and deeply extensively for highlyefficient electrolysis. For example, by using methane reforming reaction to replace the slow OER at the anode, the product CO can be obtained in both anode and cathode with high selectivity.[14](#page-9-0) The coproductions of valuable formate and sulfur can be achieved by coupling CO2ER with sulfion oxidation reaction[.15](#page-9-0) Simultaneous upgrading of polyethylene terephthalate and CO2 to HCOOH has been reported as an effective electrocatalytic waste treatment and valueadded strategy[.19](#page-9-0) It has also been demonstrated that coupling CO2ER with glycerol electro-oxidation could reduce electricity consumption by as much as 53%.[20](#page-9-0) In another study, formate can be obtained by glycerol electro-oxidation at the anode and CO2ER at the cathode, resulting in a total FE value of 130% from both side.[22](#page-9-0) Thus, addressing the challenge of energy consumption and improving catalytic efficiency via CO2ER coupling with thermodynamically favorable oxidation reaction are urgent issues to be solved to further improve current density and electrolysis efficiency for potential industrial application.

Reasonable design and synthesis of electrocatalysts with high electrocatalytic activity is crucial for couple the reduction and oxidation reaction together.[23,24](#page-9-0) Among numerous electrocatalysts for CO2ER into HCOOH, Bi-based catalysts offer advantages of environmental friendliness and abundant earth reserves. Various tactics, including morphology modulation[11,12,25](#page-9-0)–<sup>28</sup> and electron engineering,[29](#page-9-0)–<sup>36</sup> have been widely proposed and explored to improve their catalytic activity and stability.[37,38](#page-10-0) For instance, Li et al.[38](#page-10-0) reported ultrathin bismuth nanosheets constructed from in situ topotactic transformation for efficient CO2ER to HCOOH by virtue of the enlarged surface area and abundant under-coordinated Bi sites. Luo et al.[39](#page-10-0) constructed boron atoms-modified bismuth for boosting the conversion of CO2 into HCOOH. Boron doping could favorably regulate the local electronic structure of Bi, leading to decreased Gibbs free energy barriers during the process. However, deep investigations in the design of Bi-based catalysts for CO2ER reactions at high current densities are relatively lacking, which restrict their potential industry application. To solve the problem of low CO2 solubility and high ohmic resistance caused by large distance between electrodes in traditional H-cell, flow cell have been developed for continuous CO2ER to achieve high current density and product selectivity.[40](#page-10-0)

In this work, BiOCl–CuO was prepared via facile in situ growth method and exhibited efficient catalytic performance for CO2 electroreduction to HCOOH. The FE over BiOCl–CuO exceeding 90% were achieved within the potential range of 1.7 to 2.2 V versus Ag/AgCl in the flow cell and also exhibited excellent stability at the current density of 230 mA/cm2 for 15 h. The performance of CO2RR could be further promoted to 500 mA/cm2 with FEHCOOH above 90% and 700 mA/cm2 with FEHCOOH above 80% via optimizing the reaction conditions, providing a potential exploration strategy for industrial applications. Besides, to mitigate the dynamically slow OER and promote the total electrolysis efficiency, the coupling of CO2ER with HMF oxidation reaction (HMFOR) in flow cell could achieve both FEH-COOH and FEFDCA above 95% simultaneously with the current density of approximately 106 mA/cm2 , presenting a potential strategy for the efficient production of value-added chemicals via electrochemical methods.

# 2 | EXPERIMENTAL SECTION

# 2.1 | Experimental materials and reagents

Bi(NO3)35H2O, Cu(CH3COO)2H2O, HCl, NaOH, C3H6OH, CH3OH, C2H5OH, DMF, KOH, and KHCO3 were from Energy Chemical without further purification.

Synthesis of BiOCl. [41](#page-10-0) Bi(NO3)35H2O (1.86 g) was dissolved in a mixed solution containing 20.0 mL ultrapure water and 10 mL isopropanol under stirring conditions. Next, 25.0 mL of 2.0 M HCl was used to adjust pH of the mixture to 0.03. After that, 20.0 mL of 4 M NaOH was additionally injected dropwise to reaction for 6 h by stirring at room temperature. Finally, the productive BiOCl were obtained via centrifugation and wash by ethanol/water (vol/vol = 1:2) solution and then dried at 60C.

Synthesis of BiOCl–CuO. [42](#page-10-0) 0.65 g of the as-prepared BiOCl and 0.05 g of Cu(CH3COO)2H2O were added into a flask with 50.0 mL DMF and continuously stirred for 15 min. Then the whole flask was transferred to an oil bath kept at 90C for 4.0 h under stirring. After the solution was cooled to room temperature, the product of BiOCl– CuO were washed with water and dried at 60C.

# 2.2 | Characterization

X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were performed with a Bruker D8 diffractometer with Cu-Kα radiation. SEM images and energydispersive x-ray (EDX) analytical data were characterized on a Zeiss Supra55energy equipped with an EDX detector. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images were obtained on a JEOL JEM-2010 transmission electron microscope operating at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) analysis was performed from Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility 1W1B beamline. For in situ XAFS testing, the KHCO3 electrolyte was firstly pre-saturated with N2 or CO2 under open circuit, respectively. Then a suitable reduction potential was selected for CO2ER reaction to collect real-time spectra. It is important to make clear that the maintenance of electrolyte circulation via the peristaltic pump is a crucial need during testing.

# 2.3 | CO2 electroreduction

For CO2ER on BiOCl–CuO and BiOCl in H-cell, the 12 mL 0.5 M KHCO3 electrolyte was pre-saturated with N2 (pH 8.4) or CO2 REN ET AL. AICHE 3 of 12

(pH 7.4) with a flow rate of 20 mL/min, and the electrolysis was performed at a few selected potentials to test their  $CO_2ER$  performance. Flow cell consisted of BiOCl–CuO loaded GDL as the cathode, Nafion 117 as the separator, and Ni foam and Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>@CP as the anode, respectively. The electrolyte in the flow cell was 80 mL 1.0 M KOH solution (pH 13.6) with a flow rate of 20 mL/min, where the anode solution of  $CO_2ER$  coupling HMFOR reaction contained 200 mM HMF. Catalyst (1 mg) was dispersed on 1 cm<sup>-2</sup> of carbon paper to form a working electrode and an Ag/AgCl reference electrode was located inside the cathode compartment.

During the electrolysis, the gaseous product was analyzed by Shimadzu GC-2014 chromatography equipped with both FID and TCD detectors. The FE of gas product was calculated as below<sup>10,12</sup>:

$$FE(\%) = \frac{Q_{\text{gas}}}{Q_{\text{total}}} \times 100\% = \frac{\left(\frac{v}{60 \, \text{s/min}}\right) \times \left(\frac{x}{24,000 \, \text{cm}^3/\text{mol}}\right) \times N \times F}{j} \times 100\%.$$

Liquid products were collected at the conclusion of each electrocatalysis and analyzed by HPLC (Aligent Hi-plex H) with a UV-visible detector (set at 210 nm), and the HPLC eluent was 0.05 M  $\rm H_2SO_4$ . FE of HCOOH was calculated as follows<sup>10,12</sup>:

$$\mathsf{FE}_{\mathsf{HCOOH}}(\%) = \frac{Q_{\mathsf{HCOOH}}}{Q_{\mathsf{total}}} \times 100\% = \frac{n_{\mathsf{HCOOH}} \times \mathsf{N} \times \mathsf{F}}{\mathsf{i} \times \mathsf{t}} \times 100\%.$$

The cathodic energy efficiency (CEE) was calculated as follows<sup>43,44</sup>:

$$CEE = \frac{E_{OER} - E_{HCOOH}}{E_{OER} - E_{applied}} \times FE,$$

in which  $E_{\rm OER}=1.23$  V versus RHE and  $E_{\rm HCOOH}=-0.25$  V versus RHE at standard condition.  $^{45,46}$ 

# 2.4 Density functional theory calculations

The calculations in this work were performed using the CASTEP code in the Materials Studio version 2018 software package (Accelrys Software Inc., San Diego, CA).<sup>47</sup> The spin-polarized DFT + U calculations were performed using a plane wave implementation<sup>48</sup> with the generalized gradient approximation Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof as the exchange-correlation functional.<sup>49</sup> The ultrasoft pseudopotential<sup>50</sup> was applied to describe the ionic cores.<sup>51</sup> k Points was set to be  $3 \times 3 \times 1$  and cut-off energy was set to be 400 eV. The geometry optimization was based on the following points: (1) an energy tolerance of  $1.0 \times 10^5$  eV/atom, (2) a maximum displacement tolerance of  $1.0 \times 10^3$  Å, and (3) a maximum force tolerance of 0.03 eV/Å. The space group of Bi is R-3 mH, BiOCl is P4/nmm, Bi<sub>32</sub>Cl<sub>24</sub>O<sub>24</sub> bulk model was constructed based on the Bi and BiOCl, to simulate experimental results that BiOCl (110) reduction to Bi (012) under reaction voltage, p (4  $\times$  3) supercell model was built to simulate BiOCI (110) and p (1  $\times$  1) cell Bi (012) was put on the top of BiOCl (110) to form Bi (012)/BiOCl (110) structure. Cu atoms randomly replace Bi atoms in Bi (012) to simulate the effect of CuO reduction to Cu under reaction voltage.

By conducting phonon analysis on the geometrically optimized model, the Gibbs free energy (*G*) of reactants, intermediates, and products adsorbed on the catalyst surface can be obtained. The corresponding calculation formula is as follows:

$$G = E + ZPE + \int_{0}^{298.15 \text{ K}} C_{U} dT - TS,$$

where E represents the total electronic energy, ZPE represents the zero point energy, and  $\int_0^{298.15\,\text{K}}$  represents the correction term for Gibbs free energy.

The calculation formula of Gibbs free energy change of elementary reactions ( $\Delta G$ ) is as follows:

$$\Delta G = G_{\text{product}} - G_{\text{reactant}}$$

where  $G_{product}$  represents the sum of Gibbs free energy of the products in the elementary reaction formula, while  $G_{reactant}$  represents the sum of Gibbs free energy of the reactants in the elementary reaction formula

When calculating electrochemical elementary reactions, computational hydrogen electrodes (CHE) $^{52,53}$  were introduced to obtain G for proton electron pairs (H $^+$  + e $^-$ ). In the CHE model, by setting the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) as the reference potential, the energy of (H $^+$  + e $^-$ ) can be considered as half of the energy of H $_2$ .

### 3 | RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The as-prepared BiOCI-CuO electrocatalyst was synthesized via a straightforward in situ growth method. As depicted in Figure S1, the powder XRD patterns exhibited diffraction peaks corresponding to BiOCI-CuO and BiOCI assignable to BiOCI phase, though no any diffraction peaks that attributable to CuO were observed. This absence may be attributed to the low load capacity of CuO on BiOCl. According to scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Figure S2a,b), BiOCI-CuO showed a similar nanosheet structure to that of BiOCI with a lateral size of about 500 nm. Besides, as revealed in HRTEM images analysis (Figure S2c,d), the distinct lattice fringes of 0.28 nm corresponding to (110) planes of BiOCl, along with lattice fringes of 0.23 nm ascribed to (111) planes of CuO, indicating that the successful synthesis of BiOCl and the heterostructure BiOCl-CuO, respectively. Moreover, the energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy mapping (Figure S2e) of BiOCl-CuO confirmed that homogeneous distribution of Bi and Cu elements, with an approximate atomic ratio of Bi to Cu determined to be 12:1.

Moreover, to further obtain the fine structure of the as-prepared BiOCl-CuO, XAFS was conducted. As revealed in the Figure 1A, the energy position of the Bi  $L_3$ -edge of x-ray absorption near-edge

structure (XANES) spectra of BiOCl–CuO shifted to lower energy compared to that of BiOCl, proving a reduction in the Bi valence of BiOCl after CuO loading. According to Figure 1B, the amplitude intensity of Bi L3-edge k<sup>3</sup> χ(k) spectra of BiOCl–CuO was slightly lower than that of BiOCl, indicating a possible slight structure change in BiOCl after the loading of BiOCl. Based on Bi Fourier transformed extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) (Figure 1C), the main peak centered at 1.81 Å could be ascribed to the first Bi–O shell in the BiOCl structure, and the decreased peak intensity of BiOCl–CuO compared with BiOCl demonstrated that the loading of CuO resulted in the generation of O vacancy in BiOCl–CuO[.54](#page-10-0)–<sup>56</sup> Based on Figure 1D, the energy positions of Cu K-edge in the XANES spectra of BiOCl–CuO were the same to those of reference CuO, indicating a Cu valence of +2. The Cu K-edge k<sup>3</sup> χ(k) spectra (Figure 1E) of BiOCl–CuO showed a similar amplitude to that of reference CuO, which differed significantly from the reference Cu foil. According to <span id="page-4-0"></span>the Cu Fourier transformed EXAFS (Figure [1F](#page-3-0)), the main peaks centered at 1.50 and 2.48 Å were ascribed to the Cu–O and Cu–O–Cu shells for BiOCl–CuO and reference CuO, indicating that the presence of Cu in the form of CuO for BiOCl–CuO. Thus, it could be confirmed that the BiOCl–CuO with O vacancy was successfully prepared, which may benefit the promotion of catalytic performance for CO2 electroreduction as discussed below.

The CO2ER performance of BiOCl–CuO and BiOCl was detected in a gas-tight H-type electrochemical cell. According to linear sweep voltammetry curves, BiOCl–CuO showed a more positive onset potential and a larger cathodic current density in CO2-saturated electrolyte compared to that of N2 atmosphere (Figure [S3a](#page-11-0)), attesting to its higher catalytic activity for CO2ER compared to HER. As shown in Figure 2A, in CO2-saturated electrolyte, the BiOCl–CuO electrode exhibited an enhanced total current compared to BiOCl, indicating that the construction of BiOCl–CuO composite via CuO loading benefited the promotion of catalytic activity in CO2 electroreduction. To analyze the specific catalytic activity toward CO2ER in competition with the HER reaction on BiOCl–CuO and BiOCl, electrolysis was further carried out at selected potentials from 1.3 to 1.9 V (V vs. Ag/AgCl) for 1 h (Figure [S3b](#page-11-0)). Product analysis demonstrated that the products were determined to be H2, CO, and HCOOH (Figure [S4\)](#page-11-0). Based on Figure 2B, the FEHCOOH for BiOCl–CuO sharply rose to 90.0% at 1.50 V and maintained >80% over a wide potential range from 1.4 to 1.8 V. In contrast, the FEHCOOH maximum of 83.9% for BiOCl was achieved at 1.4 V, and declined rapidly at more negative

potential accompanied by increased H2 selectivity (Figure [S3c](#page-11-0)). Moreover, the maximum CEE of BiOCl–CuO is about 64%, which is higher than 59% of BiOCl (Figure [S6a](#page-11-0)). According to the Nyquist plots (Figure [S3d](#page-11-0)), charge transfer was promoted via CuO loading. Besides, the double-layer capacitance (Cdl) value of BiOCl–CuO (0.80 mF/cm2 was larger than that of BiOCl (0.38 mF/cm2 ) (Figure [S3e\)](#page-11-0), confirming that the loading of CuO could increase the electrochemical active surface area of BiOCl. Consequently, CuO loading could favorably promote the catalytic activity for CO2ER to HCOOH.

Moreover, the CO2ER performance of BiOCl–CuO was also evaluated in the flow cell, aiming for potential of industrial-scale application to substantially enhance the HCOOH production rate through the significant promotion of current density to ampere level. Based on Figure [2C,](#page-4-0) the cathodic current density of BiOCl–CuO sharply increased and notably surpassed >300 mA/cm2 at 2.4 V vs. Ag/AgCl under CO2 flow (Figure [S3f\)](#page-11-0), indicating excellent CO2 electroreduction activity. And BiOCl–CuO possessed the high FEHCOOH of above 90% across a wide potential range (1.7 to 2.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl) and increased yield of HCOOH, with a maximum FEHCOOH of 98% was reached at 2.1 V (Figure [2D](#page-4-0)). In contrast, the BiOCl catalyst obtained a maximum FEHCOOH of 75% at 1.7 V and decreased rapidly after 1.9 V, accompanied by a decreasing trend in the yield of HCOOH (Figure [S5](#page-11-0)). meanwhile, the highest CEE of BiOCl–CuO in the flow cell can reach about 69%, which is much higher than 58% of BiOCl (Figure [S6b\)](#page-11-0). Besides, during the long-term test, BiOCl–CuO also showed stable catalytic performance (Figure [S3g](#page-11-0)), reaching a current density of approximately 230 mA/cm2 at 2.1 V, with FEHCOOH retaining at about 90% for 15 h without any obvious deterioration. Furthermore, by optimizing the electrolytic cell, there was a further improvement in catalytic performance under different constant current monitoring conditions (Figure [2E](#page-4-0)), the FEHCOOH can be obtained above 90% at 500 mA/cm2 and cathodic current density could reach up to 700 mA/cm2 with FEHCOOH above 80%, while further increasing the current to 900 mA/cm2 , FEHCOOH noticeably decreased to 60% due to intense competition from HER. Such high current density for efficient HCOOH formation outperformed many recently reported Bibased catalysts (Figure [2F](#page-4-0); Table [S1](#page-11-0)), laying the foundation for future exploration of industrial applications of CO2ER to HCOOH. The absence of C2<sup>+</sup> products may be attributed to the large presence of Bi elements in the material, leading to the concentration of the active site of CO2ER reaction at the Bi site in CO2 reduction[.57](#page-10-0)–<sup>59</sup> There have also been reports of CuBi bimetallic CO2ER catalysts, most of which have high Bi content (>10%) for the high selectivity to HCOOH.[28,60,61](#page-9-0)

Furthermore, for a comprehensive examination of catalyst structural during the CO2ER, in situ XAFS was performed (Figure [3](#page-6-0)). According to Figure [3A](#page-6-0), energy position for BiOCl–CuO shifted to a larger energy when CO2 was introduced into KHCO3 electrolyte, while no obvious shift in the energy position of BiOCl could be observed (Figure [3B\)](#page-6-0), illustrating that the rapid adsorption CO2 on BiOCl–CuO compared with BiOCl, facilitating electron transfer from BiOCl–CuO to CO2 molecules. What is more, at a reduction potential of 1.5 V (V vs. Ag/AgCl), the valence of Bi of BiOCl–CuO rapidly decreased, approaching metallic Bi0 at 1.7 V (Figure [3A,](#page-6-0) inset); by contrast, the energy position of Bi for BiOCl only slightly shifted to lower energy, indicating that BiOCl–CuO could be more readily reduced under reduction potential than BiOCl. Besides, as shown in Figure [S8a,](#page-11-0) when the catalyst electrode was applied at 1.5 V in a N2 saturated electrolyte, the valence of Bi for BiOCl–CuO did not substantially decrease compared with that in CO2 saturated electrolyte. This observation, coupled with the similar offset of Bi valence for BiOCl in N2 and CO2 saturated electrolyte (Figure [S8b\)](#page-11-0), infers that the higher catalytic performance of BiOCl–CuO over BiOCl for CO2 electroreduction might be ascribed to the more flexible structure transformation of BiOCl–CuO under reduction potential. As revealed in EXAFS oscillation functions (Figure [S8c,d\)](#page-11-0), there was a significant oscillation transition occurring at reduction potentials for BiOCl–CuO, especially at potentials above 1.5 V, while the oscillation for BiOCl remained almost unchanged during the entire potential range. Further, based on the FT EXAFS (Figures [3C](#page-6-0) and [S8e](#page-11-0)), the peak intensity of the Bi–O shell centered at 1.81 Å for BiOCl–CuO significantly decreased under reduction potential, with a new peak centered at 3.02 Å, which could be assigned to the Bi–Bi shell, clearly observed compared to the reference Bi foil. This result suggests that BiOCl– CuO materials undergo transformation into metallic Bi during the electrocatalytic reduction process, while our team's previous work also proved that electron-rich Bi enhances CO2ER more effectively.[62](#page-10-0) By contrast, there was no significant decrease in the Bi–O shell peak for BiOCl (Figure [3D\)](#page-6-0) along with the appearance of a short peak for Bi–Bi shell, indicating the reduction of a very small amount of BiOCl and the generation of Bi/BiOCl. Consequently, it could be demonstrated that the BiOCl phase in BiOCl–CuO electrode could be more prone to undergo structural transformation into metallic Bi under CO2 electroreduction.

Besides, based on in situ Cu K-edge XANES spectra (Figure [3E\)](#page-6-0), CuO valence of BiOCl–CuO rapidly decreased and approached zero at 1.5 V, and combined with the similar spectra to reference Cu foil in EXAFS oscillation functions (Figure [S8f\)](#page-11-0) and FT EXAFS (Figure [3F\)](#page-6-0), confirming that CuO in BiOCl–CuO was also totally reduced into metallic Cu from the CuO phase under CO2 electroreduction. The XPS results after the CO2 electroreduction also found that the valence states of Cu and Bi in the BiOCl–CuO were lower than prior to the reaction, which indicated that Cu and Bi were reduced in the reaction (Figure [S9](#page-11-0)). In addition, the presence of metallic Bi was found in the BiOCl–CuO after CO2 electroreduction by HRTEM images (Figure [S10\)](#page-11-0). Therefore, the loading of CuO could promote the structure transfer of the heterostructure BiOCl–CuO and the construction of BiCu/BiOCl (Figure [S11\)](#page-11-0) during CO2 electroreduction to further enhance the catalytic activity for efficient generation of HCOOH[.63](#page-10-0)–<sup>65</sup> Thus, the catalytic processes of BiCu/BiOCl and Bi/BiOCl, obtained by in situ transformation of BiOCl– CuO and BiOCl, respectively, will be discussed in the context of CO2ER.

To get further mechanistic analysis of electronic structure of BiCu/BiOCl and Bi/BiOCl as discussed above, DFT calculations were carried out (Figure [4](#page-7-0)). The optimized structures of Bi/BiOCl and BiCu/ BiOCl were depicted in Figure [S12](#page-11-0). Based on the experimental analysis, the structural model of BiCu/BiOCl and Bi/BiOCl experienced in

situ structural transformation during CO2ER. The charge density difference of the BiCu/BiOCl structure was analyzed to show the charge transfer between Cu and surrounding Bi atoms, as shown in Figure [4A](#page-7-0). According to the charge density difference analysis, it can be clearly observed that the charge consumption around Cu atoms and the charge accumulation around Bi atoms in BiCu/BiOCl, indicating electron transfer from Cu to Bi, which is beneficial for the adsorption and activation of CO2 molecules on Bi active sites.[66](#page-10-0) Moreover, to delve deeper into the impact of electron transfer from Cu atoms to Bi atoms on the overall electronic structure, density of states (DOS) analysis (Figure [4B](#page-7-0)) showed that significant electron distribution near the Fermi level for Cu atoms exhibited. The p-band center (εp) of the BiCu/BiOCl structure (0.973 eV) were closer to the Fermi level than that of BiOCl structure (1.116 eV) owing to the presence of Cu and thus promoted the electron donating ability of the BiCu/BiOCl.[67](#page-10-0) To further analysis the effect of Cu on CO2 adsorption, DOS result of the adsorbed CO2 was shown in Figure [4C](#page-7-0). It can be clearly seen that the unoccupied PDOS of adsorbed CO2 molecules in BiCu/BiOCl structure was closer to the Fermi level, which made it easier for electrons to transfer.[32](#page-10-0) According to the Gibbs free energy diagram (Figure [4D\)](#page-7-0), compared to Bi/BiOCl, the active intermediate \*CO2 was more stable on BiCu/BiOCl, and BiCu/BiOCl can significantly reduce

the reaction energy barrier from the decisive step \*CO to \*OCOH in the reaction, from 0.91 eV on Bi/BiOCl to 0.70 eV on BiCu/BiOCl, thereby promoting the generation of HCOOH. Other reaction paths were also calculated to give additional theoretical support for the experiment's reaction selectivity. The previous results reported that the CO pathway competes with the HCOOH pathway, and CO is a crucial intermediate in the production of other products include CH4, C2H4, CH3COOH, and so forth[.3,68,69](#page-9-0) Consequently, the reaction selectivity can be ascertained by calculating the Gibbs free energy changes of the CO and HCOOH pathways. Figure [S13](#page-11-0) illustrates the pathway energy from CO2ER to CO catalyzed by BiCu/BiOCl and Bi/BiOCl is much higher than that of HCOOH, demonstrating the substantially lower selectivity of CO and the following CH4, C2H4, and CH3COOH products, the theoretical calculation results are in good agreement with the experimental results. Besides, the higher reaction energy barrier of HER (Figure [S14](#page-11-0)) on BiCu/BiOCl (1.25 eV) than that of Bi/BiOCl (1.06 eV) indicated the inhibition toward HER of BiCu/ BiOCl. Therefore, it can be concluded that the introduction of Cu in BiCu/BiOCl was beneficial for electron transfer between Cu and Bi, thereby promoting the activation, adsorption, and addition of active

intermediates, leading to the efficient conversion of CO2 reduction to HCOOH with a suppressed HER.

Besides, considering that OER with the sluggish kinetics greatly significantly hinder the generation of high-value-added products at the anode but the evolution of O2, to improve catalytic efficiency of whole electronic reaction, we conducted CO2ER coupled with the HMFOR (Figure [5A\)](#page-8-0) in flow cell. This approach aimed to enhance the overall catalytic efficiency of the electrochemical process by substituting OER with HMFOR. And we selected Ni(OH)2 as the most widely used electrocatalyst for the oxidation reaction[,70](#page-10-0)–<sup>73</sup> based on the XRD pattern (Figure [S15a](#page-11-0)), Ni(OH)2 catalyst was successfully synthesized, which showed a nanosheet structure according to SEM image (Figure [S15b](#page-11-0)). Through applying a wide range of cathode potentials, the products concentration from CO2ER and HMFOR was analyzed using HPLC (Figures [S4b](#page-11-0) and [S16](#page-11-0)). As shown in Figure [5B](#page-8-0), both FEHCOOH and FEFDCA above 95% simultaneously could reach at 1.9 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) with current density of 106 mA/cm2 , and maintain both about 90% within the range of 1.5 to 2.1 V accompanied by the maximum current density of 140 mA/cm2 (Figure [5C\)](#page-8-0). The BiOCl catalyst was also tested for CO2ER coupled HMFOR

reactions, with the highest FEHCOOH and FEFDCA about 73% and 89% at 1.7 V, accompanied by a decline in yield after 2.0 V (Figure [S17](#page-11-0)). Such excellent performance overcomes the challenges of obvious side reaction competition, a narrow voltage window, and low current density in CO2ER coupled anodizing reactions, surpassing the majority of the reported works (Table [S2\)](#page-11-0). The coupling of CO2ER with HMFOR could benefit the exploration of cathode–anode pairing to promote the overall electrolytic efficiency of the flow cell for further potential industrial applications.

# 4 | CONCLUSIONS

In summary, we have reported a BiOCl–CuO structure via a facile in situ growth method and exhibited excellent catalytic activity for CO2ER to HCOOH. The Faradaic efficiencies (FEs) over BiOCl–CuO exceeded 90% within the potential range of 1.7 to 2.2 V versus Ag/AgCl, with the highest FEHCOOH reaching 98% along with good stability of 15 h at the current density of 230 mA/cm2 in flow cell, and the current density could be further promoted to 500 mA/cm2 with FEHCOOH above 90% and 700 mA/cm2 with FEHCOOH above 80% by the optimization of electrolytic cell. In situ XAFS was used to capture the in situ transformation of BiOCl–CuO into BiCu/BiOCl during the CO2ER process. In addition, the DFT calculations indicate that the presence of CuO can accelerate the formation of Bi elements and enhance the electron transfer between the material and CO2, thus promoting the electrocatalytic performance. Furthermore, through replacing OER with HMFOR, the both FEHCOOH and FEFDCA above 95% simultaneously at a current density of approximately 106 mA/cm2 . This work offers a potential strategy for coupling CO2ER with the oxidation of organic molecules for the promotion of energy utilization efficiency.

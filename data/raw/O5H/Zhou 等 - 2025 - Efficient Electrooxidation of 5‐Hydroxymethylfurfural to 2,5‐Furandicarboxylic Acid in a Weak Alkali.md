# **Efficient Electrooxidation of 5-Hydroxymethylfurfural to 2,5-Furandicarboxylic Acid in a Weak Alkaline Medium Enabled by Interfacial OH<sup>−</sup> Enrichment**

**Developing electrooxidation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) in a weak alkaline medium can potentially inhibit HMF degradation to humins and thus mitigate carbon loss that is encountered in strong alkaline media; however, the activity is often compromised under low OH<sup>−</sup> concentration. Herein, by incorporating chromium oxide (CrO***x***) as a hard Lewis acid onto CoO***<sup>x</sup>* **surface (CoO***x***–CrO***x***), HMF electrooxidation activity is largely boosted in a 1 m carbonate buffer (pH 11), including higher FDCA Faradaic efficiency (from 41% to 90%), selectivity (from 33% to 92%), and yield (from 28% to 89%). The electrolysis under the weak alkaline medium can tolerate high HMF initial concentration (100 mm), showing higher carbon balance (97%) compared with that in strong alkali (≈70%). Experimental data reveal that CrO***<sup>x</sup>* **accelerates OH<sup>−</sup> migration from bulk to the electrode surface and enriches OH<sup>−</sup> at the electrode–electrolyte interface, enhancing catalyst reconstruction and reaction intermediate conversion, thus promoting the activity. Furthermore, the interfacial OH<sup>−</sup> enrichment strategy is demonstrated effective for other weak alkaline medium and for other biomass-derived molecule (ethylene glycol and glycerol) electrooxidations. This work demonstrates that hard-Lewis-acid-induced OH<sup>−</sup> enrichment dynamically optimizes interfacial microenvironment, establishing a new design principle for efficient electrocatalytic systems under weak alkaline conditions.**

**1. Introduction**

Biomass resources are abundant and carbon neutral.[\[1\]](#page-10-0) Their effective utilization is critical in sustainable chemical and fuel production as alternatives to fossil fuels,[\[2\]](#page-10-0) with recent advances (e.g., lignin depolymerization, platform molecule functionalization) highlighting the potential of biomass-derived feedstocks for high-value products.[\[3\]](#page-10-0) Among biomass-derived platform molecules, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) from lignocellulosic biomass receives special attention,[\[1b,4\]](#page-10-0) since its oxidation can deliver 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA), serving as an important feedstock to synthesize biomass-based polyethylene furandicarboxylate plastic—a green substitute for fossil-based polyethylene terephthalate plastic with an annual production capacity of over 70 million tons.[\[5\]](#page-10-0) However, traditional thermal catalytic processes require high temperature (≥50 °C) and external O2 with high pressure (≥10 bar), calling for a more sustainable approach to achieve HMF oxidation.[\[6\]](#page-10-0)

Alternatively, electrocatalytic HMF oxidation reaction (HMFOR) in aqueous solution can proceed at ambient temperature and pressure, utilize water as the oxygen source, and be ideally driven by renewable electricity,[\[7\]](#page-10-0) representing a potentially sustainable approach for FDCA synthesis. Up to now, most previous studies

have been performed in strong alkaline systems (such as 1 m KOH). This is because high OH<sup>−</sup> concentration facilitates the generation of reactive oxygen species (for instance, accelerating transition-metal-based hydroxide reconstruction to form oxyhydroxide as the active phase) and promotes hydroxyl/aldehyde

group oxidation in HMF and the corresponding intermediates, collectively contributing to efficient FDCA production (**Figure 1**a).[\[1b,8\]](#page-10-0) However, HMF is unstable in a strong alkaline medium, where it is prone to undergo alkali-catalyzed selfdegradation or polymerization processes to form humins, resulting in severe carbon loss especially under high concentration of HMF.[\[9\]](#page-10-0) This is detrimental to practical applications, because high-concentration HMF, and thus high-concentration FDCA, are demanded for reducing the separation cost. To tackle this issue, we have previously designed a single-pass continuous flow reactor to effectively suppress carbon loss in strong alkaline media, by separately feeding HMF and KOH solution, designing a reactor with high working area/volume ratio and performing single-pass mode.[\[9\]](#page-10-0) Besides the reaction system design suitable for strong alkaline conditions, we envision that conducting the reaction under low alkali concentration is worth exploration, since the material cost of acid (for example, H2SO4) for acidification to separate FDCA might be reduced,[\[10\]](#page-10-0) not to mention the intrinsically lower affinity of HMF degradation. The success of this approach relies on the development of an efficient catalyst. Recently, we reported a single-atom ruthenium supported on cobalt oxide (Ru1–Co3O4) that displayed efficient HMFOR performance in a low concentration of alkaline solution (0.1 m KOH) via enhancing OH<sup>−</sup> adsorption.[\[11\]](#page-10-0) However, HMF still shows instability in 0.1 m KOH during a long-term reaction, and thus the development of catalyst working in nonstrongly alkaline media is urgently required. The challenge lies in the low concentration of OH<sup>−</sup> in nonstrongly alkaline media that results in sluggish active oxygen species generation and reaction intermediate conversion (vide supra) (Figure 1b).

In a nonstrongly alkaline medium, we anticipate that if the OH<sup>−</sup> supply at the electrode–electrolyte interface is strengthened while the bulk pH is unaffected, electrooxidation of HMF at the interface can be enhanced accordingly, while self-degradation of HMF in the bulk phase solution can be effectively mitigated. Microenvironmental modulation of the electrode surface may be an attractive way to regulate interfacial OH<sup>−</sup> supply. It has been reported that Ru-based catalysts with optimized electronic structures can exhibit excellent water dissociation properties to provide abundant OH\*.[\[12\]](#page-10-0) For example, we previously reported a nickel-oxide-supported ruthenium single-atom catalyst (Ru1–NiO) that can selectively electrooxidize HMF to 2,5 diformylfuran (DFF) with 90% selectivity in phosphate buffer solution.[\[12a\]](#page-10-0) We found that the presence of single-atom Ru creates a favorable microenvironment for water dissociation at the electrode–electrolyte interface to afford OH\*, thereby promoting the electrooxidation of HMF. However, limited by the neutral electrolyte environment, Ru1–NiO struggles to further oxidize aldehyde intermediates to FDCA. Recently, Lei et al. reported that the ultradense loading of Ru oxide clusters (pCoHA–Ru) could convert HMF to 5-formyl-2-furoic acid (FFCA) with high selectivity (*>*80%) in a weak alkaline environment at room temperature, but obtaining FDCA required a temperature increase to 60 °C to accelerate the kinetics of FFCA oxidation.[\[13\]](#page-10-0) In addition, Lu et al. reported that the trapping of OH<sup>−</sup>, and thus the oxidation of HMF, could be accelerated by constructing Co3O4 with oxygen-rich vacancies, but the FDCA yield in the weak alkaline medium was less than 30%.[\[14\]](#page-10-0) Despite these advancements, the room-temperature electroconversion of HMF to FDCA in nonstrongly alkaline media remains fundamentally constrained by insufficient interfacial OH<sup>−</sup> supply, which limits the generation of active species and creates kinetic bottlenecks in the deep oxidation of aldehyde intermediates.

According to literature, the introduction of hard Lewis acids (HLAs, e.g., chromium oxide (CrO*x*), TiO*x*) into the electrocatalyst system is expected to modulate the behavior of OH<sup>−</sup> at the electrode–electrolyte interface and promote OH<sup>−</sup>-involved electrochemical reactions.[\[15\]](#page-10-0) For example, Guo et al. successfully constructed a microenvironment conducive to efficient seawater electrolysis in a weak alkaline environment, by anchoring noncatalytically active Cr2O3 on the surface of the active catalyst CoO*x*. [\[15b\]](#page-10-0) In addition, Dinh et al. reported that CrO*<sup>x</sup>* exhibits strong binding energy with OH<sup>−</sup> and can accelerate the electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction in a weak alkaline medium by promoting water dissociation.[\[16\]](#page-10-0) Therefore, we conceive that anchoring HLAs on the catalyst surface may facilitate HMF-to-FDCA conversion in a nonstrongly alkaline medium, where highconcentration OH<sup>−</sup> at electrode–electrolyte interface accelerates HMF conversion, while low-concentration OH<sup>−</sup> in the bulk suppresses non-Faradaic degradation (Figure 1c).

Herein, we developed a HLA-induced interfacial OH<sup>−</sup> enrichment strategy to address dual kinetic challenges in weak alkaline HMF electrooxidation: sustaining active species generation and accelerating aldehyde-to-carboxylate conversion, ultimately enabling energy-efficient FDCA synthesis. To systematically validate this concept, we first designed a CrO*x*-anchored CoO*<sup>x</sup>* nanoarray electrode (CoO*x*–CrO*x*) and identified the critical limitation of pristine CoO*<sup>x</sup>* in carbonate buffer (CB) systems: sluggish electrochemical reconstruction and intermediate conversion due to insufficient interfacial OH<sup>−</sup> supply. By introducing CrO*<sup>x</sup>* as a HLA, we achieved significant interfacial OH<sup>−</sup> enrichment, as evidenced by Laviron analysis, in situ characterization,

and electrochemical analyses. This interfacial OH- enrichment strategy yielded three key advances: 1) dramatically enhanced HMFOR performance in CB with pH 11, with FDCA Faradaic efficiency (FE) increasing from 41% to 90%, selectivity from 33% to 92%, and yield from 28% to 89%; 2) demonstration of universal applicability through successful implementation with TiO<sub>x</sub> as an alternative HLA and extension to phosphate buffer systems; 3) addressing the trade-off between HMFOR stability and efficiency, enabling high carbon balance (97%) even at high HMF initial concentrations (100 mm). Beyond HMFOR, we further validated the strategy's generality by applying it to electrooxidation of ethylene glycol and glycerol. Finally, technoeconomic analysis (TEA) showed that HMFOR in the CB system exhibits profitability. We believe that this work establishes HLA-induced interfacial OH- enrichment as a universal electrocatalyst design paradigm, offering a versatile strategy to overcome kinetic limitations and improve process viability in sustainable electrocatalytic biomass valorization.

### 2. Results and Discussion

## 2.1. Limitation of HMFOR in Weak Alkaline Media

Given that  $CoO_x$  is an appealing material for electrocatalytic HMFOR, [14,17] we used nickel-foam-supported  $CoO_x$  nanoarrays (Figure S1, Supporting Information) as a model material for HMF electrooxidation. The HMFOR performance of  $CoO_x$  in 1 M KOH with 10 and 100 mm HMF was first evaluated.  $CoO_x$  exhibited high HMFOR current density at 1.5  $V_{\rm RHE}$  and achieved >95% FDCA selectivity in the 1 M KOH system (Figure S2a,b, Supporting Information), a performance comparable to that re-

ported in the literature. [17a,18] Then, electrolysis was carried out at a constant potential of 1.5  $V_{RHE}$  and was stopped when the HMF conversion rate reached  $\approx 100\%$ . When the initial HMF concentration was increased from 10 to 100 mm, the carbon balance decreased from 87% to 71%, resulting in a decrease in FDCA yield from 83% to 68% (Figure S2c, Supporting Information). The decrease in carbon balance may be attributed to more intense self-degradation or polymerization of high-concentration HMF in strong alkaline media. [9]

We hypothesize that lowering the solution alkalinity may inhibit the above non-Faradaic processes. The CB solution, a common buffer system, is expected to provide certain economic benefits in FDCA electrosynthesis (see subsequent TEA for details); thus, we chose it as a promising weak alkaline system. Notably, dilute KOH solutions (e.g., 0.001 м KOH, pH 11) were not employed as weak alkaline systems due to their inability to provide effective pH buffering, which significantly compromises reaction efficiency (Figure S3, Supporting Information). To compare the stability of HMF (100 mm) in 1 m KOH (pH 14) and 1 m CB (pH 11), we monitored the changes in the carbon balance of the systems over time (Figures 2a,b and S4 (Supporting Information)). After 50 h, the carbon balance of the 1 м КОН (рН 14) system dropped below 20%, whereas that of the 1 м CB (pH 11) system remained close to 100%, indicating that CB effectively inhibits the self-degradation or polymerization of HMF.

To explore the HMFOR reaction pathway and mechanism of  $CoO_x$  in the 1  $\,\mathrm{M}$  CB (pH 11) system, we performed electrolysis at 1.5  $V_{\mathrm{RHE}}$ . The concentration changes of various substances over time are shown in Figure S5a (Supporting Information), where DFF accumulates more than 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furancarboxylic acid (HMFCA), suggesting that the HMFOR of  $CoO_x$  in the

CB system may follow the DFF pathway. Notably, the accumulation of a large amount of FFCA in the 1 M CB (pH 11) system suggests that FDCA generation in CB may be limited by the conversion of FFCA to FDCA (Figure \$5a, Supporting Information), which is consistent with the literature.<sup>[13]</sup> In addition, since high-valent transition metal species generated by electrochemical oxidation may act as active centers to mediate the oxidation of organic molecules via non-electrochemical reactions, [19] we suspected that high-valent Co species generated by electrooxidation in the CB system may also oxidize the HMF via nonelectrochemical processes (i.e., indirect oxidation mechanism). As shown in Figure S5b,c (Supporting Information), the significant reduction in the required charge for reducing high-valent Co species after 10 mm HMF addition at open circuit indicates the existence of an indirect oxidation mechanism of CoO<sub>x</sub>-catalyzed HMF electrooxidation in the CB system.[19]

Differences in the HMFOR performance of  $\mathrm{CoO}_x$  in weak alkaline media versus strong alkaline media were explored. As shown in Figure 2c, the current density of  $\mathrm{CoO}_x$  at 1.5  $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{RHE}}$  decreased from 52.2 to 22.0 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> when the supporting electrolyte was changed from 1 m KOH (pH 14) to 1 m CB (pH 11). In addition, as shown in Figures 2d and S6 (Supporting Information), the product distribution of  $\mathrm{CoO}_x$  at 1.5  $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{RHE}}$  indicates that changing the supporting electrolyte from KOH to CB led to lower FDCA selectivity (from 97% to 33%) and yield (from 68% to 30%), but higher carbon balance (from 71% to 92%). These results demonstrate that  $\mathrm{CoO}_x$ -catalyzed HMFOR in weak alkaline media effectively mitigates carbon loss, but inevitably suffers from low FDCA selectivity. Consequently, achieving a balance between high carbon balance and high FDCA selectivity remains challenging for  $\mathrm{CoO}_x$ .

The effect of OH<sup>-</sup> supply on the reconstruction of CoO<sub>x</sub> and the transformation of HMFOR intermediates needs to be explored in depth. To eliminate the effect of the different ionic species in the supporting electrolyte on HMFOR, we chose CBs containing the same ionic species (differing only in pH) for the study. To simplify the study and make the difference in OH<sup>-</sup> supply more obvious, CBs at pH 9 and 11 were compared. As shown in Figure S7 (Supporting Information), the FDCA FE, selectivity, and yield of CoO<sub>x</sub> at pH 11 were significantly better than those at pH 9. To investigate the effect of OH<sup>-</sup> on the reconstruction of CoO<sub>x</sub>, we performed in situ Raman characterization. As shown in Figure 2e, in the CB system at pH 11, CoO<sub>x</sub> was reconstructed from Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> to CoOOH under applied potential, and when the potential was restored to a low potential, CoOOH could be reversibly reconstructed to Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>. Importantly, the electrochemical reconstruction of CoO<sub>x</sub> from Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> to CoOOH was more facilitated in the pH 11 system than in the pH 9 system, suggesting that stronger OH<sup>-</sup> supply favored the reconstruction of CoO<sub>x</sub> (Figure S8, Supporting Information). In addition, to determine the HM-FOR rate-determining step (RDS) of CoO<sub>x</sub>, we conducted reaction rate constant measurements. The pseudo-first-order treatment of HMF, HMFCA, DFF, and FFCA oxidations yields a linear  $\ln(c_0/c)$ -time relationship, and the associated slope gives reaction rate constants (k). The elementary step showing the minimum k value was deduced to be the RDS in HMFOR.<sup>[20]</sup> Unlike oxidation of HMFCA to FFCA serving as RDS over CoO, in a strong alkaline system, [14] oxidation of FFCA to FDCA became the RDS in the weak alkaline system (Figures S9 and S10, Supporting Information). It is well-known that hydration of aldehyde

groups is favorably base-catalyzed. Therefore, a stronger OH-supply may help to accelerate the HMFOR RDS of  $CoO_x$ . The higher FFCA oxidation rate constants for  $CoO_x$  in the pH 11 system than in the pH 9 system precisely corroborate the above statement (Figure S10, Supporting Information). From the above, it can be concluded that in a weak alkaline medium, the insufficient OH- supply may limit the reconstruction of the catalyst and the further oxidation of FFCA, thereby affecting the FDCA production (Figure 2f).

#### 2.2. Synthesis and Characterization of CoO, -CrO,

Enhancing the OH $^-$  supply capacity at the electrode–electrolyte interface may be an effective strategy to overcome the limitation of  $CoO_x$  in catalyzing HMFOR in weak alkaline media. Considering the Lewis acid–base interactions between HLA and  $OH^{-,[15b,16]}$  anchoring HLA on the  $CoO_x$  surface may regulate  $OH^-$  distribution at the electrode–electrolyte interface, thereby influencing its HMFOR performance.

 $CrO_x$  is a strongly acidic HLA, <sup>[15b]</sup> and it exhibits negligible activity for HMFOR (Figure S11, Supporting Information); therefore, we anchored  $CrO_x$  on the  $CoO_x$  surface.  $CoO_x$ – $CrO_x$  was prepared via the process shown in Figure S12 (Supporting Information). The Co/Cr atomic ratio was optimized to be 1:0.11, because the corresponding sample had the highest FDCA yield (91%) among all synthesized samples at 1.5  $V_{RHE}$  for 4 h reaction, as shown in Table S1 and Figures S13 and S14 (Supporting Information).  $CoO_x$ – $CrO_x$  in the following text refers to the optimized sample with Co/Cr atomic ratio of 1:0.11.

The structure of CoO<sub>x</sub>-CrO<sub>x</sub> was then characterized. The Xray diffraction (XRD) patterns shown in Figure 3a indicate that the introduction of CrO<sub>x</sub> did not significantly affect the characteristic peaks of CoO<sub>x</sub>, and the main phases of both CoO<sub>x</sub>-CrO<sub>x</sub> and CoO<sub>x</sub> include Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (PDF#43-1003) and Ni (PDF#04-0850, deriving from the nickel foam substrate). No characteristic peaks associated with chromium oxides were observed, suggesting that CrO<sub>x</sub> may exist as an amorphous phase.<sup>[21]</sup> The Raman spectra shown in Figure 3b exhibit characteristic vibrational bands of A<sub>1g</sub> (690 cm<sup>-1</sup>),  $F_{2g}^{(1)}$  (619 cm<sup>-1</sup>),  $F_{2g}^{(2)}$  (523 cm<sup>-1</sup>),  $E_{g}$  (483 cm<sup>-1</sup>), and F<sub>2g</sub><sup>(3)</sup> (192 cm<sup>-1</sup>) corresponding to Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>,<sup>[22]</sup> confirming that CoO<sub>x</sub> is mainly composed of Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, consistent with XRD results. The presence of Cr-O vibration band (792 cm $^{-1}$ ) in CoO $_x$ - ${\rm CrO}_x$  indicates the successful introduction of  ${\rm CrO}_x$ . [21a] The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image shown in Figure 3c reveals that the CoO<sub>x</sub>-CrO<sub>x</sub> nanoarrays are uniformly distributed on the nickel foam surface. The combination of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning TEM-energy dispersive X-ray (STEM-EDX) mapping images shows that  $CoO_x$  has a rod-like morphology, with CrO<sub>x</sub> surrounding it (Figure 3d and Figure \$15 (Supporting Information)). The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image reveals lattice fringes in CoO<sub>x</sub>-CrO<sub>x</sub> attributed to the (311) plane of Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (Figure 3e), consistent with XRD results. A combination of HRTEM, STEM-EDX, and XRD suggests that the amorphous area around Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> shown in Figure 3e may be attributed to the amorphous CrO<sub>x</sub>. Pyridine Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (Py-FTIR) was performed to characterize Lewis acidic sites in  $CoO_x$ – $CrO_x$ . As shown in Figure S16 (Supporting Information), the absorption peaks at 1041 and 1068

cm<sup>-1</sup> correspond to the  $\nu_{12}$  and  $\nu_{18a}$  ring modes of adsorbed pyridine, respectively.<sup>[23]</sup> The ratio of pyridine adsorption peak areas for  $\text{CoO}_x$  to  $\text{CoO}_x$ – $\text{CrO}_x$  is 1:1.79, indicating that  $\text{CrO}_x$  introduction enhances the Lewis acidity of the catalyst.

To investigate whether interfacial electron transfer exists between CoO<sub>x</sub> and CrO<sub>x</sub> in CoO<sub>x</sub>-CrO<sub>x</sub>, we performed X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) characterization. The high-resolution XPS spectra of Co 2p<sub>3/2</sub> for CoO<sub>x</sub> and CoO<sub>x</sub>-CrO<sub>x</sub> are shown in Figure \$17 (Supporting Information), where they are deconvoluted into three peaks corresponding to Co<sup>3+</sup> (779.8 eV), Co<sup>2+</sup> (781.5 eV), and satellite (Sat., 784.5 eV) peaks.<sup>[24]</sup> Notably, the Co  $2p_{3/2}$  XPS peak of  $CoO_x$ – $CrO_x$  remains essentially unshifted compared to CoO<sub>x</sub>, indicating that CrO<sub>x</sub> introduction did not significantly alter the surface Co valence state. In the O 1s XPS spectra (Figure \$18, Supporting Information), CoO<sub>x</sub>-CrO<sub>x</sub> exhibits a relatively higher metal oxyhydroxide (O<sub>M-OH</sub>) component than CoO<sub>x</sub>, which may originate from stronger Lewis acid-base interactions between Cr species and OH-.[15b,16] In the Cr K-edge XANES (Figure \$19, Supporting Information), the K-edge absorption energy of CoO<sub>x</sub>-CrO<sub>x</sub> is significantly higher than that of Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and slightly lower than that of CrO<sub>3</sub>, indicating that the Cr in  $CoO_x$ -CrO<sub>x</sub> is in a higher valence state (>+3). The distinct pre-edge peak at ≈5995 eV further confirms the presence of high-valent Cr species in CoO<sub>x</sub>-CrO<sub>x</sub>, <sup>[25]</sup> consistent with the Cr 2p XPS results in Figure S20 (Supporting Information). Additionally, the Co K-edge XANES of CoO<sub>x</sub>-CrO<sub>x</sub> (Figure 3f) aligns closely with that of CoO<sub>x</sub> and lies between Co<sup>2+</sup> (CoO) and Co3+ (Co2O3) references, confirming the mixed oxidation state of Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> and no significant interfacial electron transfer between  $CoO_x$  and  $CrO_x$ , consistent with the Co  $2p_{3/2}$  XPS results. The higher white line intensity of commercial CoO likely originates from its high-spin octahedral  $Co^{2+}$ -dominated structure, which exhibits more significant  $e_g$  orbital vacancies and higher transition probabilities compared to the mixed-valent  $Co_3O_4$ -like  $CoO_{\nu}$ - $CrO_{\nu}$ . $^{[12b,26]}$ 

### 2.3. HMFOR Performance of CoO, -CrO, in Weak Alkaline Media

The HMFOR activity on  $\text{CoO}_x\text{-CrO}_x$  was first evaluated in 1 M CB (pH 11) + 10 mm HMF. The steady-state LSV curves demonstrated that the introduction of  $\text{CrO}_x$  significantly enhanced the current density across a range of applied potentials, such as 1.5  $\text{V}_{\text{RHE}}$  (from 5.77 to 18.60 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>) (Figure 4a and Figures S21 and S22 (Supporting Information)). In addition, the smaller charge transfer resistance ( $R_{\text{ct}}$ ) of  $\text{CoO}_x\text{-CrO}_x$  (8.34  $\Omega$ ) compared to that of  $\text{CoO}_x$  (24.4  $\Omega$ ) indicates that  $\text{CoO}_x\text{-CrO}_x$  exhibits enhanced charge transfer capability (Figure S23, Supporting Information). As shown in Figure 4b, the Tafel slope of  $\text{CoO}_x\text{-CrO}_x$  for HMFOR is 85.9 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>, which is superior to  $\text{CoO}_x$  (121.6 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>), indicating that the introduction of  $\text{CrO}_x$  can accelerate the HMFOR kinetics.

The effect of  ${\rm CrO}_x$  introduction on the HMFOR reactivity of  ${\rm CoO}_x$  in the weak alkaline medium was explored. As shown in Figure S24 (Supporting Information), the current density of  ${\rm CoO}_x$ – ${\rm CrO}_x$  in the weak alkaline medium approaches that of  ${\rm CoO}_x$  in the strong alkaline medium at 1.5  ${\rm V}_{\rm RHE}$ . In addition, with  ${\rm CrO}_x$  introduction, the onset potential shifts negatively, indicating enhanced catalyst reconstruction propensity, as evidenced by Raman results (Figure S25, Supporting Information). These results demonstrate that  ${\rm CrO}_x$  introduction can significantly enhance the HMFOR reactivity of  ${\rm CoO}_x$  under weak alkaline conditions.

The volume of electrolyte and the initial concentration of HMF in (c)–(f) were 50 mL and 100 mm, respectively.

To investigate the effect of CrO*<sup>x</sup>* introduction on the FDCA production performance, we then performed electrolysis at 1.5 VRHE in 1 m CB (pH 11) + 10 mm HMF. After 0.5 h of electrolysis, the product distributions of CoO*<sup>x</sup>* and CoO*x*–CrO*<sup>x</sup>* are shown in Figure S26a (Supporting Information), where both DFF and HMFCA are present but the DFF component is more abundant, indicating that HMF-to-FDCA conversion follows both DFF and HMFCA pathways, with the DFF pathway predominating (Figure S26b, Supporting Information). The FDCA selectivity of CoO*x*– CrO*<sup>x</sup>* (34%) was higher than that of CoO*<sup>x</sup>* (14%), suggesting that CrO*<sup>x</sup>* introduction facilitated FDCA production. As shown in Figure S27a (Supporting Information), after 4 h of HMF electrolysis at 1.5 VRHE, CoO*x*–CrO*<sup>x</sup>* exhibited higher FE (84% vs 44%) and yield (91% vs 27%) for FDCA production compared to CoO*x*. Moreover, CoO*x*–CrO*<sup>x</sup>* showed higher FDCA selectivity (93%) than CoO*<sup>x</sup>* (35%), indicating that CrO*<sup>x</sup>* introduction may promote the further oxidation of FFCA to FDCA (Figure S27b, Supporting Information). In addition, we performed XAS, TEM, and SEM characterizations of the used CoO*x*–CrO*<sup>x</sup>* (Figure S28, Supporting Information). Co K-edge XANES spectra showed slight increase in the oxidation state of Co (vs the initial catalyst), which could be attributed to surface oxidation under reaction conditions. Whereas, TEM and SEM images of the used CoO*x*–CrO*<sup>x</sup>* confirmed that the nanorod array morphology remained intact without significant changes.

To investigate the applicability of CoO*x*–CrO*<sup>x</sup>* in high-HMFconcentration systems, we increased the HMF concentration to 100 mm. As shown in Figure S29 (Supporting Information), the steady-state LSV curves, electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS), and Tafel slopes indicate that the HMFOR performance of CoO*x*–CrO*<sup>x</sup>* is superior to that of CoO*<sup>x</sup>* even in the 1 m CB (pH 11) + 100 mm HMF system. We then performed electrolysis at 1.5 VRHE for 48 h. The species distribution and consumed charge versus time are shown in Figure 4c. The FE and yield for FDCA production at 48 h are shown in Figure 4d, where CoO*x*–CrO*<sup>x</sup>* exhibits significantly enhanced FDCA production performance compared to CoO*<sup>x</sup>* (FE: 90% vs 41%, yield: 89% vs 28%). In addition, the FDCA productivity increased significantly from 0.019 to 0.062 mmol cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> h<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> after CrO*<sup>x</sup>* was introduced into the CoO*<sup>x</sup>* system (Figure S30, Supporting Information). The product distribution results indicate that the main product of CoO*x*–CrO*<sup>x</sup>* is FDCA (FDCA selectivity: 92%, FFCA selectivity: 8%), while the main product of CoO*<sup>x</sup>* is FFCA (FDCA selectivity: 33%, FFCA selectivity: 63%), suggesting that the presence of CrO*<sup>x</sup>* can still promote the oxidation of FFCA to FDCA in the high-HMF-concentration systems (Figure 4e), similar to that under low-concentration conditions (Figure S27b, Supporting Information). In addition, compared with previous reports on HMFOR in nonstrongly alkaline media (including acidic and weak alkaline media), CoO*x*–CrO*<sup>x</sup>* can be applied to high-HMFconcentration systems and exhibits higher FDCA FE, selectivity, and yield (Table S2, Supporting Information). Notably, as shown in Figure 4f, the electrolysis in 1 m CB (pH 11) can tolerate high HMF initial concentration (100 mm), showing a higher carbon balance (97%) compared to that in 1 m KOH (pH 14) (72%). Moreover, the FDCA selectivity of CoO*x*–CrO*<sup>x</sup>* in the 1 m CB (pH 11) system approaches that in the 1 m KOH (pH 14) system (Figure S31, Supporting Information). Therefore, after introducing inactive CrO*<sup>x</sup>* into the CoO*<sup>x</sup>* system, CoO*x*–CrO*<sup>x</sup>* successfully achieves a balance between high carbon balance (97%) and high FDCA selectivity (92%) in the weak alkaline medium of 1 m CB (pH 11).

# 2.4. Understanding of the Enhanced HMFOR Performance of $CoO_{\nu}$ -CrO $_{\nu}$

Based on the discussion in Section 2.1, it is clear that the low HMFOR reactivity of  $\text{CoO}_x$  in CB stems from the insufficient  $\text{OH}^-$  supply at the electrode–electrolyte interface, which hinders catalyst reconstruction and intermediate conversion. Meanwhile, experimental evidence showed that after  $\text{CrO}_x$  introduction, the FDCA selectivity of the catalyst increased significantly (from 33% to 92%; Figure 4e) at the same reaction potential (1.5  $\text{V}_{\text{RHE}}$ ) and time (48 h). Therefore, we hypothesized that  $\text{CrO}_x$  introduction enhances the HMFOR reactivity of  $\text{CoO}_x$  by modulating  $\text{OH}^-$  supply at the electrode–electrolyte interface.

To investigate the effect of  $CrO_x$  introduction on interfacial OH<sup>-</sup> supply, Laviron analysis was conducted. [27] As shown in Figure S32 (Supporting Information), the redox peak current densities of both  $CoO_x$  and  $CoO_x$ – $CrO_x$  are linearly dependent on the square root of the potential sweep rate, indicating that the rate-limiting step of metal site redox is controlled by the mass diffusion from electrolyte to electrode. [28] The redox of Co sites is usually coupled with the transfer of OH<sup>-</sup>, and the redox constants ( $k_s$ ) can be calculated by the Laviron equation. [29] As shown in Figure 5a,b, the  $k_s$  of  $CoO_x$ – $CrO_x$  (0.146 s<sup>-1</sup>) exceeds that of  $CoO_x$  (0.096 s<sup>-1</sup>), indicating that the presence of  $CrO_x$  promotes OH<sup>-</sup> migration and adsorption to the electrode surface, that is, enhances the interfacial OH<sup>-</sup> supply.

For electrooxidation in CB,  $OH^-$  is primarily provided by the carbonate hydrolysis ( $CO_3^{2-} + H_2O \rightarrow HCO_3^- + OH^-$ ). To reveal the role of carbonate hydrolysis during HMFOR over  $CoO_x$  and

CoO<sub>x</sub>-CrO<sub>x</sub> in the weak alkaline medium, we carried out in situ Raman tests to study the carbonate hydrolysis behavior by monitoring the pH value at the electrode-electrolyte interface. [12a,30] The standard curve of electrode surface pH was established by the peak area ratio of CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup>/HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> (Figure S33, Supporting Information). To make the vibrational bands of CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup> and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> more distinct in the Raman spectra, we used a CB solution at pH  $\approx$ 10 as the supporting electrolyte. As shown in Figure 5c and Figure S34 (Supporting Information), after 640 s of HM-FOR, CoO<sub>x</sub>-CrO<sub>x</sub> exhibited higher surface pH values compared to those of CoO<sub>x</sub> at potentials of 1.4 (9.91 vs 9.80), 1.5 (9.85 vs 9.78), and 1.6  $\ensuremath{V_{\text{RHE}}}$  (9.72 vs 9.57). The above results collectively confirmed that the introduction of CrO<sub>x</sub> enhanced the interfacial OH- supply, attributable to the stronger OH- binding ability of CrO<sub>x</sub>, [15b,16] which facilitates the migration of OH<sup>-</sup> generated from carbonate hydrolysis in bulk solution to the electrode sur-

Based on the above understanding, we postulated that the introduction of  $CrO_x$  might affect the electrochemical reconstruction behavior of  $CoO_x$  (by altering mechanism or improving reactivity). First, in situ Raman confirmed the electrochemical reconstruction of  $CoO_x$ – $CrO_x$  during HMFOR (from  $Co_3O_4$  to CoOOH; Figure S35, Supporting Information). Then, based on the Nernst equation, we found that the introduction of  $CrO_x$  did not affect the reconstruction mechanism of  $CoO_x$  (Figure S36, Supporting Information). [28] To investigate the effect of the enhanced interfacial  $OH^-$  supply on the reconstruction rate of  $CoO_x$ – $CrO_x$ , operando EIS tests were conducted. [31] The equivalent circuit model is shown in Figure S37 (Supporting

Information), where interface 1 responds to catalyst oxidation (reconstruction), which is closely related to OH<sup>−</sup> adsorption, and *R*<sup>2</sup> represents the resistance of catalyst reconstruction. The Bode plots of CoO*x*–CrO*<sup>x</sup>* and CoO*<sup>x</sup>* at a series of potentials are shown in Figure [5d](#page-6-0) and Figure S38 (Supporting Information), respectively, where the arrows emphasize the change in charge transfer associated with catalyst reconstruction with potential. In the potential range of ≈1.4–1.5 VRHE, the variations of the peak phase angle (Figure S39, Supporting Information) and *R*<sup>2</sup> (Figure [5e\)](#page-6-0) for CoO*x*–CrO*<sup>x</sup>* are significantly greater than those of CoO*x*, indicating that the introduction of CrO*<sup>x</sup>* dramatically accelerates the catalyst reconstruction, which is consistent with the experimental results of the apparent activation energy (Figure S40, Supporting Information) and the in situ Co K-edge XANES spectra (Figure S41, Supporting Information). This evidence indirectly reflects that the introduction of CrO*<sup>x</sup>* can accelerate the interfacial OH<sup>−</sup> supply, which is consistent with the Laviron analysis and in situ Raman results discussed above.

Since the apparent activity of a catalyst is usually determined by the number of redox-active sites and intrinsic activity, it is necessary to elucidate the effect of CrO*<sup>x</sup>* introduction on both the number of redox active sites and intrinsic activity of CoO*x*. The amount of redox-active Co sites can be calculated from the linear relationship between the peak current density of Co<sup>2</sup>+/3<sup>+</sup> and the CV scan rate.[\[32\]](#page-10-0) We found that the number of redox active sites increased after CrO*<sup>x</sup>* introduction (Figure S42a–c, Supporting Information). To determine whether the high HMFOR activity of CoO*x*–CrO*<sup>x</sup>* is caused by an increased number of redoxactive sites, we calculated turnover frequencies (TOFs). As shown in Figure S42d (Supporting Information), CoO*x*–CrO*<sup>x</sup>* exhibits higher TOFs than CoO*x*, suggesting enhanced intrinsic HMFOR activity, further supported by the double layer capacitance (*C*dl)– normalized steady-state LSV curves (Figure S43, Supporting Information). Thus, the enhancement of interfacial OH<sup>−</sup> supply not only leads to the generation of more redox active sites, but also to a boosted intrinsic activity.

Given that the hydration of aldehyde groups is correlated with the alkalinity of the system,[\[19b\]](#page-10-0) the enhancement of the interfacial OH<sup>−</sup> supply may accelerate the conversion of HMFOR intermediates. The oxidation reaction rate constants of HMF, HM-FCA, DFF, and FFCA are shown in Figure S44 (Supporting Information), where FFCA has the smallest value (3.03 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>4</sup> s<sup>−</sup>1), indicating that the RDS of HMFOR over CoO*x*–CrO*<sup>x</sup>* in the 1 m CB (pH 11) system is the oxidation of FFCA to FDCA, consistent with that over CoO*<sup>x</sup>* (Figure S10b, Supporting Information). Notably, the FFCA oxidation reaction rate constant increased upon CrO*<sup>x</sup>* introduction (Figure [5f\)](#page-6-0), indicating that the enhanced interfacial OH<sup>−</sup> supply accelerated the kinetics of the HMFOR RDS.

Based on the above results, we have drawn a schematic diagram (Figure S45, Supporting Information) illustrating the enhancement of interfacial OH<sup>−</sup> supply to promote HMFOR. Specifically, in the CB system, carbonate hydrolysis generates OH<sup>−</sup>, and CrO*<sup>x</sup>* acts as the HLA to attract OH<sup>−</sup>, thus enhancing OH<sup>−</sup> supply at the electrode–electrolyte interface, which would facilitate the catalyst reconstruction to form CoOOH and HMFto-FDCA conversion. More specifically, as shown in **Figure 6**, the oxidation of HMF on the CoO*x*–CrO*<sup>x</sup>* surface primarily follows the HMF → DFF → FFCA → FDCA pathway, with the FFCA-to-FDCA step being the RDS. The enhanced interfacial OH<sup>−</sup> supply

**Figure 6.** Schematic representation of the possible mechanism of CoO*x*– CrO*<sup>x</sup>* as a catalyst to catalyze the conversion of HMF to FDCA in the CB system. RDS: rate-determining step.

effectively promotes both the electrochemical reconstruction of CoO*<sup>x</sup>* and the non-electrochemical conversion of FFCA to FDCA, ultimately enabling highly efficient FDCA electrosynthesis in the CB system.

## **2.5. Universality of the Interfacial OH<sup>−</sup> Supply Enhancement Strategy**

Given that the introduction of CrO*<sup>x</sup>* into the CoO*<sup>x</sup>* system can enhance interfacial OH<sup>−</sup> supply, it is worth exploring whether the introduction of other HLAs (e.g., TiO*<sup>x</sup>* [\[15b\]](#page-10-0) ) has a similar effect. We prepared CoO*x*–TiO*<sup>x</sup>* using the same method as the preparation of CoO*x*–CrO*<sup>x</sup>* (Figure S46, Supporting Information), and the synthetic details are shown in the Supporting Information. As shown in Figure S47 (Supporting Information), after the introduction of TiO*x*, CoO*x*–TiO*<sup>x</sup>* exhibited significantly enhanced FDCA production performance, including FDCA FE (from 41% to 79%), selectivity (from 33% to 79%), and yield (from 28% to 76%). Moreover, we observed that the FDCA selectivity of CoO*x*– TiO*<sup>x</sup>* (79%) was inferior to that of CoO*x*–CrO*<sup>x</sup>* (92%). This may be due to the fact that the acidity of CoO*x*–TiO*<sup>x</sup>* is weaker than that of CoO*x*–CrO*<sup>x</sup>* (as evidenced by the Py-FTIR result shown in Figure S48 in the Supporting Information), resulting in a relatively weak OH<sup>−</sup> supply capacity for CoO*x*–TiO*<sup>x</sup>* (as evidenced by the Laviron analysis shown in Figure S49 in the Supporting Information).

To investigate whether the interfacial OH<sup>−</sup> supply enhancement strategy can also promote HMFOR in other weak alkaline media (such as phosphate buffer solution, PB) like in the 1 m CB (pH 11) system, we conducted the following electrolysis experiments. PB was prepared by adjusting the pH to 11 via adding a 1 m KOH solution to a 1 m potassium hydrogen phosphate solution. In the PB system, CoO*x*–CrO*<sup>x</sup>* also exhibited higher FDCA FE (88% vs 44%), selectivity (95% vs 35%), and yield (91% vs 28%) compared to CoO*<sup>x</sup>* (Figure S50, Supporting Information). The above results indicated that CoO*x*–CrO*<sup>x</sup>* is still applicable to the PB system.

The volume of anode electrolyte and the initial concentration of HMF were 16 mL and 100 mm, respectively. The impact of different FEs and current densities on the production cost of FDCA and the FDCA production cost by using CoO*x*–CrO*<sup>x</sup>* in c) 1 m KOH and d) 1 m CB systems. Assuming the cell voltages remain constant at 2.3 and 2.5 V in 1 m KOH and 1 m CB systems, respectively, the FDCA levelized cost of 3175 \$ ton−<sup>1</sup> is obtained from references.[\[35\]](#page-10-0)

The electrooxidation activity of other biomass-derived platform molecules, such as ethylene glycol (EG) and glycerol (GLY), is also related to OH<sup>−</sup>. [\[33\]](#page-10-0) In order to investigate the ability of CoO*x*– CrO*<sup>x</sup>* to efficiently electrooxidize EG and GLY in the weak alkaline medium, we performed LSV and constant potential (1.5 VRHE) electrolysis tests. The LSV curves (Figures S51a and S52a, Supporting Information) showed that the oxidation current densities of EG (from 29.7 to 43.4 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2) and GLY (from 38.6 to 58.0 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2) increased significantly at 1.5 VRHE after the CrO*<sup>x</sup>* introduction. The product distribution results showed that the main products of both EG oxidation reaction and GLY oxidation reaction (GLYOR) were formic acid (FA) (Figures S51b and S52b, Supporting Information). Noteworthy, the introduction of CrO*<sup>x</sup>* contributed to the improvement of FA productivity. Taking GLYOR as an example, the FA productivity increased from 0.047 mmol cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> h<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> (CoO*x*) to 0.070 mmol cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> h<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> (CoO*x*– CrO*x*) (Figure S52b, Supporting Information). The above results suggest that the enhancement of interfacial OH<sup>−</sup> supply may also play an important role in boosting the oxidation activity of EG

and GLY and the production efficiency of FA in the weak alkaline medium.

#### **2.6. Flow Cell and Technoeconomic Analysis**

We assembled a circulated flow cell (the electrolyte was circulated through a peristaltic pump) to evaluate the ability of CoO*x*–CrO*<sup>x</sup>* to continuously produce FDCA. The flow cell was assembled with CoO*x*–CrO*<sup>x</sup>* as the anode, PtRu/C as the cathode,[\[34\]](#page-10-0) and a bipolar membrane (**Figure 7**a). The supporting electrolytes for the anode/cathode chambers were consistent, both being 16 mL of 1 m KOH (pH 14) or 1 m CB (pH 11), and 100 mm HMF was added to the anode electrolyte. The variation of cell voltage over time at a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> for 24 h is shown in Figure S53a (Supporting Information), where the cell voltages of the KOH and CB systems are about 2.3 and 2.5 V, respectively. The product distribution results at 24 h showed that the FDCA selectivity of the KOH system (100%) was higher than that of the

CB system (79%), and the CB system was accompanied by the generation of 21% FFCA (Figure S53b, Supporting Information). Notably, the carbon balance of the CB system (98%) was significantly higher than that of the KOH system (51%) (Figure [7b\)](#page-8-0), resulting in higher FDCA FE (81% vs 54%) and yield (76% vs 51%) for the CB system (Figure S53c, Supporting Information). The above results indicate that the CB system maintains superior carbon balance compared to the KOH system in the flow cell.

Based on the performance of the flow cell and the modeling of electrocatalytic carboxylate production,[\[10\]](#page-10-0) a TEA was performed to assess the economic feasibility. Specific TEA details are provided in the Supporting Information. Figures S54 and S55 (Supporting Information) showed the complete process for the preparation of FDCA by electrooxidation of HMF in KOH and CB systems, respectively. Under the base case scenario, the mass balances of FDCA production in KOH and CB systems are summarized in Figures S56 and S57 (Supporting Information), respectively, where only 1.06 kg of HMF is required to produce 1 kg of FDCA in the CB system, compared to 1.60 kg of HMF in the KOH system. As discussed in the literature,[\[10\]](#page-10-0) product separation from alkaline systems requires acidification, resulting in some inorganic salts by-products formation. In our system, the use of excess KOH and K2CO3 resulted in the production of large amounts of K2SO4 (KOH system) and KHCO3 (CB system), respectively. The calculation of the levelized cost for FDCA (LCFDCA) production accounts for the sales of K2SO4 and KHCO3.

Under the base case scenario, the LCFDCA in the CB system (≈1842 \$ tonFDCA<sup>−</sup>1) was lower than that in the KOH system (≈4347 \$ tonFDCA<sup>−</sup>1), which indicated that the CB system has higher profit potential. Specific LCFDCA calculation details are provided in the Supporting Information. Moreover, the LCFDCA in the CB system is also lower than that (3175 \$ tonFDCA−1) reported in the reference.[\[35\]](#page-10-0) To investigate the reasons for the superiority of the CB system over the KOH system, the composition of the total cost was analyzed. In both systems, material costs dominated (Figures S58 and S59, Supporting Information). This reveals that variations in material prices may have an important effect on LCFDCA, and therefore a sensitivity analysis was performed on the price of each material. LCFDCA in KOH/CB systems (Figures S60 and S61, Supporting Information) is primarily controlled by KOH/K2SO4 and K2CO3/KHCO3 pricing, respectively. In the KOH system model, residual KOH from HMFOR is acidified with H2SO4 to obtain K2SO4, while in the CB system model, residual K2CO3 reacts with CO2/H2O to form KHCO3. To simplify the analysis, for the KOH system, only the consumption of KOH and the production of K2SO4 were considered; for the CB system, only the consumption of K2CO3 and the production of KHCO3 were considered. As shown in Figure S56 (Supporting Information) (the KOH system), consuming 7.12 kg of KOH (0.82 \$ kg<sup>−</sup>1) will produce 9.96 kg of K2SO4 (0.5 \$ kg<sup>−</sup>1),[\[10,34\]](#page-10-0) which will result in a negative profit of −0.86 \$. Similarly, as shown in Figure S57 (Supporting Information) (the CB system), consuming 9.71 kg of K2CO3 (1 \$ kg<sup>−</sup>1) will produce 12.38 kg of KHCO3 (0.8 \$ kg<sup>−</sup>1),[\[10,34\]](#page-10-0) which will result in a positive profit of 0.19 \$. Therefore, the differences in the type, consumption, and price of the supporting electrolyte may be the main reason for the superiority of the CB system over the KOH system.

In addition, considering that current density and FE are two important and correlated parameters of electrocatalysis, a sensitivity analysis was performed to reveal the effects of their variations on LCFDCA. As shown in Figure [7c,d,](#page-8-0) the LCFDCA is less sensitive to current density and more susceptible to FE when the current density is larger than 10 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2. Importantly, for the CB system, when the current density is greater than 10 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> and the FE exceeds 40%, the LCFDCA is generally lower than 3175 \$ tonFDCA<sup>−</sup>1, [\[35\]](#page-10-0) further indicating its potential for profitability.

# **3. Conclusion**

In summary, we incorporated CrO*<sup>x</sup>* as a HLA onto the CoO*<sup>x</sup>* surface and successfully realized the enhancement of OH<sup>−</sup> supply at the electrode–electrolyte interface. The developed CoO*x*– CrO*<sup>x</sup>* catalyst can catalyze HMFOR efficiently in a weak alkaline medium (1 m CB) with pH 11, exhibiting higher FDCA FE (90% vs 41%), selectivity (92% vs 33%), and yield (89% vs 28%) compared to CoO*x*. The electrolysis in 1 m CB can tolerate high HMF initial concentration (100 mm), exhibiting a higher carbon balance (97%) versus that in 1 m KOH (≈70%). Laviron analysis, in situ Raman, in situ EIS, and intermediate oxidation reaction rate constants revealed that the CrO*<sup>x</sup>* introduction enhanced the OH<sup>−</sup> supply at the electrode–electrolyte interface to facilitate the CoO*x*-to-CoOOH reconstruction and HMF-to-FDCA conversion, thus promoting the activity. Furthermore, we validated the universality of the interfacial OH<sup>−</sup> supply enhancement strategy by introducing another HLA, TiO*x*, into the CoO*<sup>x</sup>* system to construct the CoO*x*–TiO*x*, which also demonstrated superior HMFOR performance over CoO*x*. Additionally, CoO*x*–CrO*<sup>x</sup>* was applied to electrooxidation of other biomass-derived molecules (ethylene glycol and glycerol), achieving significant FA productivity enhancement. TEA demonstrated that HMFOR in the CB system exhibits promising profit potential. This work develops a universal microenvironmental regulation strategy at the electrode– electrolyte interface by introducing HLAs, enabling enhanced interfacial OH<sup>−</sup> supply to accelerate the reaction kinetics. The comprehensive understanding and efficient approach established in this work can inspire further research, guiding the development of efficient and sustainable electrocatalysts for wide applications of renewable electricity for biomass valorization.

Electrocatalytic oxidation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMFOR) to 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) using highly efficient electrocatalysts is currently a research hotspot. In this study, nickel foam-supported Cedoped transition metal phosphide (*i.e.*, Ce-NiP<sub>x</sub>/NF) was synthesized using a one-step electrochemical deposition method. The Lewis acidity of the Ce species offered adsorption sites for oxygen-containing substrates, and the electronic structure of Ni could be effectively adjusted due to its variable valence state. In addition, the charge modulation of Ce and P promoted the rapid valorization of Ni, and the escape of P during the reaction formed many oxygen vacancies, which facilitated the adsorption of HMF. The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) required overpotentials of only 116 mV and 276 mV for a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, respectively. For HMFOR, the HMF conversion reached almost 100%, and the FDCA yield and Faraday efficiency were 98.69% and 98.38% at 1.40  $V_{\rm RHE}$ , respectively, and both remained above 95% after 20 cycles. This study presents a facile method for constructing heteroatomic electrodes for electrocatalytic oxidation and reduction and provides a method for designing high-performance electrocatalysts.

### 1. Introduction

In recent years, with the implementation of low-carbon goals, the search for alternatives to traditional petrochemical materials has become a development trend, and biomass energy has developed rapidly and is expected to replace traditional chemical energy sources.<sup>1,2</sup> 2,5-Furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) is one of the 12 most representative bio-based platform compounds identified by the U.S. Department of Energy in 2004 from more than 300 biomass compounds. FDCA consists of a furan ring and two carboxyl groups and has a wide range of applications in polymer manufacturing, fine chemical synthesis, plastics and pharmaceutical manufacturing.<sup>3,4</sup> In particular, FDCA replacing terephthalic acid (TPA) for the preparation of poly(ethylene 2,5-furandicarboxylate) (PEF) is key to developing degradable plastics.<sup>5</sup> Therefore, the synthesis and preparation of FDCA are of great significance. Among them, the preparation of FDCA by the 5-hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation reaction (HMFOR) is a well-established scheme at present.<sup>6</sup> In addition, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) can be obtained from biomass conversion, which is a low-cost and

Paper

Transition metal phosphides (TMPs) have been demonstrated to possess efficient HMFOR properties. 18 Because of the low catalytic activity of the phosphorus (P) element, it does not introduce side-reaction active sites during catalysis. 19,20 When transition metals are combined with P, the metal active sites increase and the electronic structure changes, which promotes variation in the metal valence state and optimizes the adsorption/desorption capacity of the catalysts.<sup>21</sup> Meanwhile, owing to the rich variety of phosphides and easy preparation, researchers can design transition metal phosphides by different methods to achieve different catalytic performances. Song et al. constructed a nanosheet-integrated electrode catalyst, CoNiP-NIE, by etching and phosphorylation.<sup>22</sup> Owing to the charge modulation of P, CoNiP-NIE showed enhanced conductivity and improved FDCA desorption, exhibiting excellent HMFOR capability. Knani et al. loaded the Ni<sub>x</sub>Co<sub>y</sub>P on a carbon nanoweb, where P acted as a negatively charged group to change the electronic properties of positively charged Ni.<sup>23</sup> Moreover, the presence of Co stabilized the overall structure with good catalytic activity, and the FDCA Faraday effect was more than 90%. Although TMPs have shown excellent electrocatalytic ability, they are limited by their low mass transfer capacity and require modification to obtain higher catalytic efficiency.

To design a catalyst structure, researchers usually dope or modify different elements to build heterostructures or introduce heteroatoms to optimize the interfacial electronic configuration and expose more active sites.<sup>24</sup> Cerium has flexible and variable valence states (Ce<sup>3+</sup> and Ce<sup>4+</sup>), which facilitate the transfer of electrons during catalysis and promote charge transfer between materials.<sup>25</sup> Zhang et al. first proposed to phosphorylate Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-CeO<sub>2</sub> and prepared CoP-CeO<sub>2</sub> thin films on titanium mesh, which had excellent long-term HER performance owing to the stabilization ability of CeO<sub>2</sub> for CoP.<sup>26</sup> Jiang et al. designed the core-shell structured CeO2-CoP with increased oxygen vacancies; the heterostructure of CeO2 and CoP changed the Fermi energy level, and the electrons were transferred from CoP to CeO2, achieving only 254 mV OER overpotential at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>.<sup>27</sup> Even though Ce species have been applied to improve the electrocatalytic HMFOR performance of transition metal oxides, 28 transition metal nitrides, 29 MOFs<sup>30</sup> and LDHs, <sup>31,32</sup> there was still a lack of studies on the role of Ce species in transition metal phosphides for electrocatalytic HMFOR.

In this study, we prepared nickel foam-supported Ce-doped  $NiP_x$  (i.e., Ce- $NiP_x/NF$ ) by applying a one-step electrodeposition method as an HMFOR electrocatalytic anode. The formation of Ce-NiP<sub>x</sub>/NF could improve the adsorption capacity of oxygencontaining substances owing to the Lewis acidity of Ce. Moreover, electron transfer between Ce and Ni optimized the

electronic structure of Ce-NiPx/NF, which enabled rapid oxidation and reduction between Ni and NiOOH. In addition, the combination of P and Ni increased the number of reaction sites in Ce-NiP<sub>x</sub>/NF, and the escape of P during the reaction provided a large number of oxygen vacancies. The present study proposes the construction of heteroatom electrocatalysts by applying a simple electrodeposition method. It offers a way to design electrocatalysts with excellent performance in the future.

#### 2. Results and discussion

#### Characterization

Ce-NiP<sub>x</sub>/NF was prepared via one-step electrodeposition (Fig. 1a). For comparison, NiPx/NF and CePx/NF were obtained by electrodeposition without the introduction of Ce or Ni, respectively. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image in Fig. 1b showed that Ce-NiPx/N presented a porous mesh structure that was favorable for the exposure of the active sites. In Fig. S1,† NiPx/NF presented a thin nanosheet-like structure, indicating that the introduction of Ce caused the nanosheets of NiP,/NF to form a thicker and more porous wall-like structure. In contrast, CePx/NF showed a hill-like structure (Fig. S2†), implying that Ce doping into NiP<sub>x</sub>/NF can effectively change the material conformation. As depicted in Fig. 1c, the XRD patterns of the three materials were compared. From these results, it can be found that the three materials had the same three high diffraction peaks at 44.5°, 51.8° and 76.4°, which correspond to the (111), (200) and (220) crystal planes of Ni of the nickel foam substrate, respectively (PDF#04-0850). Additionally, there were no other diffraction peaks for NiP<sub>x</sub>/NF and CePx/NF, implying that the obtained materials are amorphous, as reported in other studies.33,34 The materials were explored by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and selected area electron diffraction (SAED). As shown in Fig. 1d and S3,† Ce-NiPx/NF exhibited an amorphous state. It is reported that the surface amorphous structure promotes electron transfer.<sup>35</sup> In Fig. 1e, the EDX mapping image of Ce-NiP<sub>x</sub>/ NF showed a uniform distribution of Ni, Ce, P, and O elements, and the corresponding EDX elemental profiles (Fig. S4†) showed the content of each element, which illustrated the successful synthesis of Ce-NiPx/NF material. Since the presence of CeO<sub>2</sub> or other Ce-based particles was not observed on the surface of the material and the XRD did not show peaks of Cebased materials, this suggests that Ce was doped into the NiP<sub>x</sub> material. TEM images and SAED images of NiPx/NF and CePx/ NF indicated that the obtained materials had an amorphous structure (Fig. S5 and S6†). Based on EDX elemental profiles and EDX mapping, it can be determined that NiPx/NF and CePx/ NF were successfully prepared. The limited Ni element shown in the EDX mapping of CeP<sub>x</sub>/NF was due to nickel foam.

catalysts. The LSV curves for the three samples are shown in Fig. 2a. All curves were tested with 90% iR compensation. It was found that Ce-NiP<sub>r</sub>/NF had the best HER performance. Further, Ce-NiPx/NF had the lowest potentials, 116 mV and 235 mV, at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> and 100 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> current densities, respectively (Fig. 2b). The Tafel slope was an important kinetic parameter in electrochemistry that described the relationship between the rate of the reaction and electrode potential. During the test, the Tafel slope was obtained using the steadystate timed-current method. As shown in Fig. 2c, the Tafel slope of Ce-NiP<sub>x</sub>/NF was 305.9 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>, which was lower compared to NiP<sub>x</sub>/NF (335.5 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>) and CeP<sub>x</sub>/NF (328.3 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>), implying that Ce-NiP<sub>x</sub>/NF had a faster electrochemical reaction rate. EIS tests were performed to probe the process kinetics of the working electrode during the electrocatalytic reaction. A comparison of the different Nyquist plots in 1 M KOH is shown in Fig. 2d. The equivalent circuit in the inset includes the system resistor  $(R_s)$ , charge transfer resistor  $(R_{ct})$ , and constant phase element (CPE). The R<sub>ct</sub> value of Ce-NiP<sub>x</sub>/ NF was 0.62  $\Omega$ , which was lower than NiP<sub>x</sub>/NF (0.77  $\Omega$ ) and  $\text{CeP}_x/\text{NF}$  (1.01  $\Omega$ ). The lower  $R_{\text{ct}}$  indicated that  $\text{Ce-NiP}_x/\text{NF}$  had better electronic conductivity and a faster charge transfer rate in the HER reaction.<sup>36</sup> The electrochemical surface area (ECSA) test was able to reflect the electrocatalytic activity of the electrode. First, double-layer capacitance  $(C_{dl})$  was obtained by cyclic voltammetry (CV) (Fig. S7 $\dagger$ ). As shown in Fig. 2e, the  $C_{\rm dl}$ value of Ce-NiP<sub>x</sub>/NF was 5.50 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>, which was higher

2Theta (degree)

those of than NiPx/NF (3.76 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>) and CePx/NF (3.95 mF cm $^{-2}$ ). A higher  $C_{\rm dl}$  value indicated that the material had a larger ECSA, which meant more reactive sites. According to the calculated ECSA value shown in Table S1,† Ce-NiPx/NF had the largest ECSA value (11.22 cm<sup>2</sup><sub>ECSA</sub>). The comparison of the ECSA-normalized LSV curves in Fig. 2f showed that Ce-NiP<sub>x</sub>/NF had superior HER performance.

Ni

In situ EIS was used to investigate the interfacial processes between the electrode materials and the substrates. EIS tests were performed at different potentials from -0.05 V to -0.40 Vfor the three materials. The results are shown in Fig. 2g and S8.† With decreasing potential, the diameter of the Nyquist semicircle decreases, indicating that the reaction resistance decreases, the charge transition accelerates, and the HER reaction intensifies. The Bode plot reflects the microscopic process of the material during the reaction. As shown in Fig. S9,† the phase angle peaks of NiPx/NF F, CePx/NF and Ce-NiPx/NF continue to decrease with decreasing potential, indicating the interfacial charge transfer was accelerated with decreasing potential.

The long-time stability of Ce-NiP<sub>x</sub>/NF was verified through a constant current test. As shown in Fig. S10,† Ce-NiPx/NF was kept in 1 M KOH at -0.225  $V_{RHE}$  for  $100\,000$  s. There was a small change in voltage, indicating that Ce-NiPx/NF possesses good HER stability. As depicted in Fig. 2h, when comparing the LSV curves before and after the stability test, it can be found that almost all the curves overlap. In this work, a hydroPaper

gen production test was performed by applying the drainage gas collection method using an H-type electrolytic cell (Fig. S11†). The results are shown in Fig. 2i, and after 40 min of gas collection, the Faraday efficiencies of the HER for Ce-NiP $_x$ /NF were all kept above 97% according to the calculations. The high Faraday efficiency indicated that Ce-NiP $_x$ /NF had great catalytic selectivity in HER. $^{37}$ 

OER was tested in 1 M KOH. The LSV curves are shown in Fig. 3a. Ce-NiP<sub>x</sub>/NF had superior OER performance. The overpotentials of Ce-NiP<sub>x</sub>/NF were 276 and 337 mV at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> and 50 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, respectively, which were smaller than those of NiP<sub>x</sub>/NF and CeP<sub>x</sub>/NF (Fig. S12†). The Tafel slope of the OER process was tested at 1.50 V–1.60 V<sub>RHE</sub>, as shown in Fig. 3b. Compared to NiP<sub>x</sub>/NF (94.9 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>) and CeP<sub>x</sub>/NF (100.9 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>), Ce-NiP<sub>x</sub>/NF had the lowest Tafel slope of 93.9 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>. This indicates that Ce-NiP<sub>x</sub>/NF had a faster reaction rate in the

OER process. The Nyquist plots at the 1.60 V<sub>RHE</sub> were compared, as shown in Fig. 3c, and Ce-NiPx/NF had the smallest semicircle diameter during the OER process. The  $R_{\rm ct}$  value of 0.59  $\Omega$  for Ce- $NiP_x/NF$  was smaller than those of  $NiP_x/NF$  (0.73  $\Omega$ ) and  $CeP_x/NF$ (1.45  $\Omega$ ), meaning that Ce-NiP<sub>x</sub>/NF had faster electron transfer. The  $C_{\rm dl}$  value was obtained by performing CV tests in the non-Faraday interval with different sweeping speeds. As shown in Fig. 3d and S13,† the  $C_{\rm dl}$  value of Ce-NiP<sub>x</sub>/NF was 1.50 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>. which was greater than those of NiP<sub>x</sub>/NF (1.42 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>) and CePx/NF (1.42 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>). This indicated that the actual active areas of the three samples were similar during the OER process. The ECSA values of the three samples in the OER process are listed in Table S1.† The ECSA-normalized LSV curves were compared, as shown in Fig. 3e, and Ce-NiPx/NF had the best OER catalytic activity. Therefore, with a similar active area, Ce had a strong catalytic enhancement ability for NiPx.

In situ EIS tests were performed at 1.10 V-1.65 V<sub>RHE</sub>, as shown in Fig. 3f and S14.† As the potential increased, the reaction resistance decreased continuously and the Nyquist semicircle decreased. The Bode plot of Ce-NiPx/NF (Fig. 3g) showed a phase angle peak in the high-frequency region when the potential was less than 1.30 V<sub>RHE</sub>, which was a change in phase angle caused by the oxidation of the catalyst.<sup>38</sup> At 1.45 V<sub>RHE</sub>, a phase angle peak was observed in the lower frequency region, which coincided with the appearance of the OER process.<sup>31</sup> As the potential continues to increase, the phase angle peak in the low-frequency region decreases and shifts to the high-frequency region, implying that the charge exchanged at the interface was intensified and the OER reaction was accelerated. A similar trend was observed in the Boder plots of  $NiP_x/NF$  and  $CeP_x/NF$  (Fig. S15†).

Long-time stability tests were performed at 1.515 V<sub>RHE</sub> of Ce-NiP<sub>x</sub>/NF (Fig. 3h). After the 100 000 s test, it was found to

be not significantly changed for the LSV curves before and after the test (Fig. S16†), indicating the excellent stability of Ce-NiPx/NF during the OER process. Subsequently, an oxygen production test was conducted in an H-type electrolysis cell (Fig. S17†). As shown in Fig. 3i, the Faraday efficiencies of the OER of Ce-NiP<sub>r</sub>/NF were all calculated to be above 95%, with great OER performance when recorded every 10 min for 40 min.

HMFOR was tested in 1 M KOH with 50 mM HMF. The CV for 60 cycles is shown in Fig. S18a-d.† The 60th CV curves before (NF) and after electrodeposition (NiPx/NF, CePx/NF and Ce-NiPx/NF) were compared, as illustrated in Fig. S18e and S18f.† The redox peaks of NF, NiPx/NF and Ce-NiPx/NF corresponded to the conversion of Ni<sup>2+</sup> and Ni<sup>3+</sup>, and the addition of Ce improved the CV activity.39 CePx/NF showed a larger redox peak, which might be formed by the superposition of the peaks of Ni<sup>2+</sup>-Ni<sup>3+</sup> (from Ni foam) and Ce<sup>3+</sup>-Ce<sup>4+</sup>.

The LSV curves showed that Ce-NiP $_x$ /NF had the best HMFOR performance (Fig. 4a). At 1.40 V $_{\rm RHE}$ , Ce-NiP $_x$ /NF had a maximum current density of 53.8 mA cm $^{-2}$  (Fig. 4b). The LSV curves of Ce-NiP $_x$ /NF in 1 M KOH and 1 M KOH + 50 mM HMF were compared, as depicted in Fig. 4c. It can be found that the potential decreases from 1.506 V $_{\rm RHE}$  (OER) to 1.311 V $_{\rm RHE}$  (HMFOR) at a current density of 10 mA cm $^{-2}$ , a difference of 195 mV. Thus, HMFOR had a lower onset potential compared to OER, so replacing the kinetically slower OER with HMFOR was greatly advantageous in terms of economic efficiency. The Tafel slopes in 1 M KOH + 50 mM HMF were compared, as shown in Fig. S19,† and Ce-NiP $_x$ /NF was found to have the lowest slope, at 61.6 mV dec $^{-1}$ . The  $C_{\rm dl}$  values of the samples were determined through CV tests with different sweep speeds (Fig. S20†), which were then calculated to obtain the ECSA

values (Table S1†). As demonstrated in Fig. 4d, the  $C_{\rm dl}$  of Ce-NiP<sub>x</sub>/NF was 1.60 mF cm<sup>-2</sup> in the alkaline solution containing HMF, which was superior to NiP<sub>x</sub>/NF and CeP<sub>x</sub>/NF (1.28 and 1.33 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>, respectively). The ECSA-normalized LSV curves indicated that Ce-NiP<sub>x</sub>/NF exhibited the best HMFOR performance, as shown in Fig. S21.† Two thousand CV tests were performed to determine the stability of Ce-NiP<sub>x</sub>/NF in HMF-containing bases. As illustrated in Fig. 4e, the comparison of the LSV curves indicated that Ce-NiP<sub>x</sub>/NF had good stability.

Multipotential step curves in 1 M KOH + 50 mM HMF depicted the electrochemical processes occurring for Ce-NiP $_x$ / NF. As shown in Fig. 4f, there was almost no response current before the 1.30 V $_{\rm RHE}$  potential, which occurred when the low potential inhibited the charge transfer. At the instant of different potential steps, there was an instantaneous decrease

in the response current, which was caused by the adsorption of HMF and OH $^{-28}$  As the potential increased, the response current started to appear at 1.35  $V_{\rm RHE}$ , which corresponded to the occurrence of HMFOR. The response current increased significantly at a voltage of 1.40  $V_{\rm RHE}$  when the charge transfer was accelerated, and the substrate underwent oxidation and accelerated substance transfer. At 1.45  $V_{\rm RHE}$ , the decrease in response current with time slowed down possibly due to the oxidation of the electrode. When it was 1.60  $V_{\rm RHE}$ , the response current gradually increased over the timeframe owing to the addition of the competing reaction, OER. The results were consistent with the trend of the LSV curves, suggesting that it was the dominant range for HMFOR at 1.35–1.55  $V_{\rm RHE}$ .

EIS showed the impedance of the material. As shown in Fig. 4g, Ce-NiP<sub>x</sub>/NF had the lowest electrochemical impedance of 3.15  $\Omega$  at 1.40 V<sub>RHE</sub>. In comparison, NiP<sub>x</sub>/NF and CeP<sub>x</sub>/NF impedances were 4.68  $\Omega$  and 7.43  $\Omega$ , respectively. This indicates that Ce-NiP<sub>x</sub>/NF had an optimal kinetic process. 40 Fig. 4h and S22† show the in situ EIS Nyquist plots of NiPx/NF, CePx/ NF and Ce-NiPx/NF. The Nyquist semicircle decreased with increasing potential. The radius of the semicircle was minimized when the potential increased to 1.40 V<sub>RHE</sub>, where HMFOR dominated. Subsequently, the radius of the semicircle became larger and then smaller as the voltage increased and was minimized at 1.65 V<sub>RHE</sub> when OER dominated. Fig. 4i and S23† show that the Bode plots of NiPx/NF, CePx/NF and Ce-NiPx/NF. Ce-NiPx/NF had a broad phase-angle peak in the high-frequency region at 1.10 V<sub>RHE</sub>, which was caused by the oxidation of the material. As the potential increased, a phase angle peak appeared in the low-frequency region at 1.30 V<sub>RHE</sub>, with the peak decreasing with increasing potential. At this moment, HMFOR occurred, accelerating the charge transfer at the interface. At 1.50 V<sub>RHE</sub>, the phase angle peak recurred in the low frequency region. This was the time a competing OER occurred, 41 which was consistent with previous results. As the potential was further increased, the phase angle decreased and shifted towards the high-frequency region, and the response intensified.42 In addition, the peak phase angles of NiPx/NF, CePx/NF and Ce-NiPx/NF were compared, as depicted in Fig. S24.† Ce-NiPx/NF had a lower peak phase angle, suggesting that the doping of Ce can effectively reduce the interfacial resistance between the catalyst and the reactants.<sup>43</sup>

There are two pathways to generating FDCA *via* HMFOR. One is the preferential oxidation of -CHO of HMF to -COOH to produce HMFCA, followed by the oxidation of hydroxyl groups to produce FFCA and FDCA. The other is the preferential oxidation of -OH of HMF to -CHO to produce DFF, followed by oxidation to produce FFCA and FDCA, as shown in Fig. 5a. <sup>44</sup> Electrolysis test of HMF was performed by constant potential electrolysis, and the product was detected by HPLC. The test results were subjected to concentration calculations using standard peak area-concentration curves (Fig. S25†). The potential for electrolysis was set at 1.40 V<sub>RHE</sub>. The transfer of six electrons was involved in the whole HMFOR process. Therefore, the complete conversion of HMF required an amount of electricity of 46.3 C in 8 mL of alkaline solution (1

M KOH) containing 50 mM HMF. The current densities and charges versus the time curves are shown in Fig. S26.† To detect the pathway of the reaction, a sample solution was drawn every 10 C of electricity passed during electrolysis. In the obtained product trace plot (Fig. 5b), it can be observed that as the electrolysis proceeds, the intensity of the HMF peak decreases and the FDCA peak increases. Among them, at the peak-out time of 1.99 min, the generation of intermediate product HMFCA could be observed. Besides, the peaks of DFF and FFCA were not observed. As illustrated in Fig. 5c, the product peaks of each step were integrated to illustrate the intermediates of the reaction more visually. It was noticed that the concentration of HMFCA was volcanic, while DFF and FFCA were not detected, meaning that HMFOR occurred via path 1. Meanwhile, it was inferred that Ce-NiPx/NF promoted the rapid transformation of FFCA. 45 Subsequently, electrolysis experiments were tested at different potentials. The results are shown in Fig. 5d. For Ce-NiPx/NF, the HMF conversion reached 100%, and the FDCA yield and Faraday efficiency were 98.69% and 98.38% at 1.40  $V_{RHE}$ , respectively. As the potential increased, the HMF conversion, FDCA yield, and faradaic efficiency decreased, which was attributed to the incorporation of competing OER. In addition, 20 cycles were performed at 1.40 V<sub>RHE</sub> of Ce-NiP<sub>x</sub>/NF (Fig. 5e), and it was found that the changes in FDCA yield and faradaic efficiency were small and maintained above 95%. As shown in Table S2,† Ce-NiPx/NF was compared with the other materials, confirming that Ce-NiPx/NF had superior performance. A comparison between HER + OER and HER + HMFOR was performed in an H-type electrolytic cell (Fig. S27†) of Ce-NiPx/NF, and the LSV curve is shown in Fig. 5f. After the addition of HMF, the potential was reduced from 1.585  $V_{RHE}$  to 1.413  $V_{RHE}$  at 50 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, with a difference of 172 mV. This proved the potential of Ce-NiP<sub>x</sub>/NF in practical production.

The evolution of the interfacial species of Ce-NiPx/NF in HMFOR was investigated using in situ Raman spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. 5g and h, there was no significant peak change observed at 1.10 V-1.40 V<sub>RHE</sub>. When the potential increased to 1.45 V<sub>RHE</sub>, Raman peaks were observed at 473 cm<sup>-1</sup> and 552 cm<sup>-1</sup>, corresponding to the stretch ( $\delta$ (Ni<sup>3+</sup>-O)) and vibration ( $\nu(Ni^{3+}-O)$ ) of NiOOH, respectively, <sup>46,47</sup> and the intensity of the NiOOH peaks increased as the potential increased. It has been reported that NiOOH is a substance that reacts directly with HMF. 48 In practical experiments, 1.40 V<sub>RHE</sub> was the optimum potential for Ce-NiPx/NF. Since there was no obvious NiOOH peak at 1.40 V<sub>RHE</sub> in the Raman spectra, it was presumed that NiOOH reacted rapidly with HMF and was reduced to Ni(OH)2 immediately after its generation. The oxidation of HMF at a high potential was slower than the generation of NiOOH. At this moment, the competitive reaction OER inhibited HMFOR, 49 which was demonstrated by the accumulation of NiOOH with an elevated peak.

#### 2.3. Atomic structure and electronic interaction

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was applied to analyze the atomic valence states and microscopic interactions. As

shown in Fig. 6a, the Ni 2p spectra of  $NiP_x/NF$  and  $Ce-NiP_x/NF$  before and after the addition of elemental Ce were compared. Among the peaks obtained by back convolution, 855.9 eV and 873.6 eV correspond to  $Ni^{2+}$ , 860.7 eV and 878.2 eV correspond to  $Ni^{3+}$ , as well as two satellites. The Ni  $2p_{3/2}$  spectrum of Ce- $NiP_x/NF$  was back-convolved into four peaks. The new peak of  $Ni^{\delta+}$  (852.1 eV) was characteristic of nickel phosphide species compared with  $NiP_x/NF$ .  $^{40,46}$  The binding energies of both  $Ni^{2+}$  and  $Ni^{3+}$  increased by 0.1 eV compared to  $NiP_x/NF$ . The level of valence change can be reflected by calculating the ratio of the intensities of  $Ni^{2+}$  and  $Ni^{3+}$  in the material. In  $NiP_x/NF$ , the value of  $Ni^{2+}/Ni^{3+}$  was 2.44, which was much lower than the value of  $Ni^{2+}/Ni^{3+}$  in Ce- $NiP_x/NF$  (3.34). This means that the surface Ni of Ce- $NiP_x/NF$  had a much lower valence state,

demonstrating a change in the electronic structure of Ni. As depicted in Fig. 6b, the Ni  $2p_{3/2}$  spectrum of Ce-NiP<sub>x</sub>/NF after HMFOR was back-convoluted into multiple peaks, where 851.9 eV corresponded to Ni<sup>δ+</sup>, 855.5 eV and 873.3 eV to Ni<sup>2+</sup>, and 860.9 eV and 878.8 eV to Ni<sup>3+</sup>. Comparing the results before HMFOR, the Ni<sup>2+</sup> binding energy decreased by 0.5 eV, the Ni<sup>3+</sup> binding energy increased by 0.1 eV, and the value of Ni<sup>2+</sup>/Ni<sup>3+</sup> decreased to 2.81, implying an increase in the content of Ni<sup>3+</sup> species on the surface. <sup>50</sup> Meanwhile, the relative peak intensity of Ni<sup>δ+</sup> was substantially increased, implying a more pronounced nickel phosphide signature. According to the NiP<sub>x</sub>/NF and CeP<sub>x</sub>/NF spectra after HMFOR, as illustrated in Fig. S28,† NiP<sub>x</sub>/NF did not show Ni<sup>δ+</sup> peaks after HMFOR, suggesting the promotion of Ni–P bonding by Ce doping.

(i) XANES spectra of NiP<sub>x</sub>/NF, Ce-NiP<sub>x</sub>/NF and Ce-NiP<sub>x</sub>/NF after HMFOR for Ce K-edge.

The state of Ce-NiP<sub>x</sub>/NF was explored by characterising the material after HMFOR. As shown in Fig. S29,† the XRD of Ce-NiP<sub>r</sub>/NF after HMFOR showed obvious NiP<sub>r</sub> peaks compared to those before the reaction. This is consistent with the XPS results. Besides, the TEM image (Fig. S30a†) of the post-reaction Ce-NiPx/NF showed NiO lattice stripes with a lattice spacing of 0.241 nm corresponding to the NiO (1, 1, 1) crystal plane (PDF#47-1049). This was attributed to the fact that a part of the Ni monoatoms accumulated on the surface during the reaction, which were then oxygenated to become NiO.51 Analysis of the EDX spectrum and EDX mapping (Fig. S30b and S30c†) revealed that the concentration of P on the surface was greatly reduced after the reaction, proving the escape of P in the reaction process.

The Ce 3d spectra of CePx/NF and Ce-NiPx/NF were compared, as depicted in Fig. 6c, and it can be observed that the spectra were formed by two broad peaks and multiple peaks after deconvolution. The peaks of 879.0 eV, 885.0 eV, 896.8 eV, 900.2 eV, 907.9 eV and 915.9 eV corresponded to the Ce<sup>3+</sup>, and the peaks of 881.3 eV and 904.0 eV corresponded to the Ce<sup>4+</sup>. After Ce was doped into NiPx, all peaks were positively shifted. Meanwhile, comparing the value of Ce<sup>3+</sup>/Ce<sup>4+</sup>, it decreased from 1.40 to 1.02, indicating that more Ce4+ appeared and became the electron-withdrawing center. The Ce 3d pattern of Ce-NiP<sub>x</sub>/NF after HMFOR is shown in Fig. 6d. Compared with  $Ce-NiP_x/NF$ , the value of  $Ce^{3+}/Ce^{4+}$  increased from 1.02 to 1.07, noting the increased intensity of Ce3+ on the surface of the material. This implies that Ce<sup>4+</sup> received the electrons, and the

valence decreased. Therefore, combined with the Ni spectroscopy results, it was inferred that during the reaction, electrons were transferred from Ni<sup>2+</sup> to Ce<sup>4+</sup>, and the electronic configuration was optimized.

The spectrum of P 2p is shown in Fig. 6e. After the doping of Ce, the main peak binding energy of P increased by 0.1 eV, indicating the electron transfer of P. The results of the combined Ni and Ce spectra were inferred. The electron transfer between P and Ni resulted in the formation of the Ni-P structure, which optimized the metallic valence state of Ni and the electrical conductivity of Ce-NiP<sub>x</sub>/NF. Simultaneously, P also affected the electron cloud of Ni.<sup>23</sup> Therefore, the co-deployment of Ce and P on Ni promotes the redistribution of the charge structure and regulates the morphology of Ni, so Ce-NiPx/NF has fast electrocatalytic reaction dynamics. The observation that the P peak pattern after HMFOR was undetectable indicated that the P atoms escaped from the surface during HMFOR. This means that numerous oxygen vacancies were added to the surface of the material.<sup>52</sup> This provided many sites for the reaction. Combining with the XRD pattern after HMFOR for Ce-NiP<sub>x</sub>/NF, the NiP<sub>x</sub> peak pattern of Ce-NiPx/NF was prominent, implying that the P escape occurred only at the surface, and the main structure remained intact.

The O 1s spectra are shown in Fig. 6f. The peaks at 530.0, 531.0 and 532.3 eV correspond to metal–oxygen bonding (M–O), lattice oxygen (O-Vacancy,  $O_V$ ) and adsorbed oxygen (O-Absorbed,  $O_A$ ), respectively. For M–O, the peak shifted to the right after doping with Ce, which might be related to the promotion of Ni–P formation by Ce. The M–O peak shifted to the left by 2.0 eV after HMFOR, indicating that Ni was more combined with O owing to the escape of P to form the Ni–O structure. For  $O_V$ , the left shift occurred after the doping of Ce, implying that the addition of Ce increased the strength of the lattice oxygen. The left shift of  $O_V$  by 0.5 eV after HMFOR corresponded to the creation of a large number of oxygen vacancies by P escaping.<sup>53</sup> Many experiments have pointed out that oxygen vacancies can serve as substrate adsorption sites to

optimize substrate adsorption relationships and have direct relevance to promote the reaction.  $^{54,55}$ 

The characterization of oxygen vacancies was tested using electron paramagnetic resonance spectra (EPR). As depicted in Fig. 6g, the signal at a g value of 2.003 illustrates the oxygen vacancies of the material. The oxygen vacancy concentration of Ce-NiPx/NF after HMFOR was higher than that of Ce-NiPx/NF initially and NiPx/NF, which is consistent with the XPS characterization results. X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) provided information about the electronic structure of the material. As shown in Fig. 6h, NiPx/NF, Ce-NiPx/NF and Ce-NiPx/NF after HMFOR had similar white line peaks. The intensity of the edge peak of Ce-NiPx/NF was reduced compared with that of NiPx/NF, which was attributed to the Ce-promoted lowering of the Ni valence state. After the reaction, the intensity of the edge peaks of Ce-NiPx/NF was substantially increased, which corresponded to the increase in Ni<sup>3+</sup> content on the surface. The test results were the same as the XPS results. As illustrated in Fig. S31,† the k-space signals and R-space signals of Ni exhibited similar Ni species environments for the three materials, which may be due to the influence of the nickel foam substrate.30 The XANES of Ce is illustrated in Fig. 6i. The white line peaks of CePx/NF, Ce-NiPx/NF and Ce-NiP<sub>x</sub>/NF after HMFOR were the same as those of CeO<sub>2</sub>, indicating that Ce existed in the +4 valence. However, it was observed that there was a lot of noise in the signal of Ce, so the comparison of the side peak positions was not accurate. This may be due to the low Ce content, and it was only shortrange ordering, suggesting that Ce was in the form of doping to regulate NiPx. This promotes the rapid diffusion of O through short ion diffusion paths with good electron transfer.56

In summary, as shown in Fig. 7, we made inferences. Owing to the Lewis acidity of Ce, oxygen-containing groups  $(H_2O, OH^-, HMF, etc.)$  accumulate at the active sites near Ce, which improves the adsorption capacity of the Ce-NiP<sub>x</sub>/NF surface. Because of Ce's electron-withdrawing ability, it modu-

lates the electronic structure of Ni and promotes the reactions. For HER, H<sub>2</sub>O was adsorbed and dissociated on the Ce site, and the formed H\* was combined with Ni to generate H2 finally.29,57 For OER, the Lewis acidity of Ce increased the acidity of the OH group in the Ni site, which facilitated the rapid generation of OH\* and the combination with OH to form O2. 58,59 For HMFOR, oxygen-containing groups in HMF were enriched towards the Ce-NiPx/NF surface active sites owing to the Lewis acidity of Ce. Because of the electron-withdrawing ability of Ce, electrons were transferred from Ni<sup>2+</sup> to Ce4+ to form NiOOH.44 Subsequently, NiOOH catalyzed HMF and OH to produce FDCA and was reduced to Ni(OH)2.51,60 Then, Ni<sup>2+</sup> tended to convert to Ni<sup>3+</sup> because of the electronic modulation of Ce, so Ni(OH)2 could be reoxidized to NiOOH rapidly by current. The fast conversion between NiOOH and Ni (OH)2 was one of the keys to highly efficient electrocatalytic HMFOR.<sup>61</sup> In addition, the P of Ce-NiP<sub>x</sub>/NF did not possess strong electrocatalytic activity, but it can modulate the electronic structure of Ni and enhance the ability of electron transfer. 62 What is more, Ce-doping also promoted electron transfer between Ni and P to enhance electrical conductivity. Surface P that escaped during the reaction also exposed a large number of reactive sites, which was one of the reasons Ce-NiP<sub>r</sub>/NF performed efficiently.

## 3. Conclusions

In this study, rare earth element-doped nickel phosphide material Ce-NiPx/NF was prepared by applying a one-step electrodeposition method. It was found that Ce-NiPx/NF was able to improve the adsorption capacity of oxygen-containing substances owing to the doping of Ce. Moreover, the strong electron-absorbing ability of Ce optimizes the electronic structure of Ce-NiPx/NF, which enables Ni to change its valence rapidly and thus promotes the reaction. Besides, the electron transfer of P and Ni and the escape of P during the reaction are also responsible for the promotion of the reaction. HER and OER required overpotentials of only 116 mV and 276 mV for a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, respectively. For HMFOR, the potential was only 1.413  $V_{RHE}$  for a 50 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> current density when coupling HMFOR and HER. In the HMF electrolysis experiment, the HMF conversion reached almost 100%, and the FDCA yield and Faraday efficiency were 98.69% and 98.38% at 1.40  $V_{RHE}$ , respectively. Both remained above 95% after 20 electrolysis cycles. This study explores an effective way to prepare rare earth element-doped electrocatalytic materials and provides ideas for the design of electrocatalytic materials with excellent performance afterwards.

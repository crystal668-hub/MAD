#### 1. Introduction

The effective utilization of renewable resources is crucial for addressing the energy crisis. [1-3] 5-Hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), derived from the dehydration of lignocellulosic biomass, serves as a vital intermediary between biomass feedstocks and energy chemistry, acting as a versatile precursor for producing high-value chemicals. [4,9] Among the various products derived from HMF, 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) stands out as the most significant. FDCA is a sustainable alternative for synthesizing functional polymeric materials and has become a leading product for the valorization of HMF. [10] Particularly, polyethylene glycol furandicarboxylate (PEF), produced from FDCA, surpasses industrially manufactured polyethylene terephthalate (PET) in various properties. [11,12]

Traditionally, the production of FDCA from HMF involves thermocatalytic oxidation, which is associated with environmental pollution and significant energy consumption. [13] In contrast, the electrocatalytic oxidation of HMF offers a greener and more efficient approach. This approach relies solely on electronic input from the anode under ambient conditions, eliminating the need for toxic chemical oxidants. [14,15] Conse-

quently, electrocatalytic oxidation of HMF emerges as a promising strategy for biomass conversion.

To date, significant efforts have been dedicated to developing cost-effective and high-performance electrocatalysts for the 5-hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation reaction (HMFOR). Particularly, nickel-based electrocatalysts have received considerable attention owing to their catalytic activity and stability properties. To optimize the electrocatalytic performance of catalysts in electrocatalytical reactions, elemental doping engineering has proven to be an effective approach. Introducing doped elements can significantly modulate the electronic structure of electrocatalysts, and create new active sites, thus enhancing the intrinsic catalytic performance.

Manganese (Mn), adjacent to nickel in the periodic table, is an ideal dopant in Ni-based catalyst due to the minimal difference in their atomic radii. Mn doping has been shown to improve the electrochemical properties of Ni-based materials by facilitating charge transfer, enhancing the formation of active sites, and promoting the stability of the catalyst.<sup>[27]</sup> In the context of Ni-based materials, Mn doping could further optimize the electrocatalytic performance by tuning the electronic structure and improving the overall reaction efficiency. Therefore, we suppose that designing Mn-doped Ni-based materials may result in high-efficiency electrocatalyst for HMFOR. Recently, Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> nanocatalysts have been studied for HMFOR, demonstrating their potential application in HMFOR.<sup>[28]</sup> However, up to date, there is no report on the design and application of Mn-doped Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> for HMFOR.

Herein, we successfully developed Mn-doped Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> nanosheets for the efficient catalytic oxidation of HMF to FDCA. The Mn-doped Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> nanosheets were synthesized using a microwave-assisted deep eutectic solvent (DES) strategy, followed by an alkaline reflux process. The as-synthesized Mn-4Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> nanosheets achieved complete reaction at 1.44 V (vs. reversible

hydrogen electrode, RHE), resulting in 100% HMF conversion, a 99.0% FDCA yield, and a 98.8% Faraday efficiency (FE). Furthermore, we employed X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis, open circuit potential (OCP) measurement, and density functional theory (DFT) calculation to thoroughly investigate the mechanism of Mn-4Ni(OH)<sup>2</sup> electrocatalyst in HMF conversion. This study provides significant insights into the role of Mn doping in Ni(OH)<sup>2</sup> and presents a robust electrocatalyst for HMFOR.

# **2. Results and Discussion**

#### **2.1. Synthesis and Structural Characterization of Mn-Doped Ni(OH)<sup>2</sup> Nanosheets**

Mn-doped Ni(OH)<sup>2</sup> nanosheets were synthesized with a microwave-assisted DES strategy, followed by an alkaline reflux process (Figure 1). In our study, the DES was prepared by a mixture of choline chloride (ChCl) and oxalic acid (OA). After microwave heating of the Mn/Ni salts in DES, Mn/Ni-based precursors formed. The as-synthesized precursors were then refluxed under alkaline conditions, ultimately converting into Mn@Ni(OH)<sup>2</sup> . The as-synthesized catalysts with various Ni/Mn salt ratio were labeled as Mn-xNi(OH)<sup>2</sup> , where ( x) represents the Ni/Mn molar ratio of the initial feed. For comparison, the Ni(OH)<sup>2</sup> nanosheets were also prepared without adding Mn salts.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) was utilized to examine the crystal structure of the prepared Mn-doped Ni(OH)<sup>2</sup> catalysts. From Figure 2a, the XRD results aligned well with the standard pattern of Ni(OH)<sup>2</sup> (JCPDS No. 14-0117). Notably, no diffraction peak associated with a new phase appeared after Mn doping, indicating that Mn atoms were incorporated as dopants into the Mn@Ni(OH)<sup>2</sup> structure. In the enlarged XRD patterns (Figure 2b), the peaks of Mn- Ni(OH)<sup>2</sup> shifted slightly to a higher angle compared to pure Ni(OH)<sup>2</sup> . This shift was ascribed to the substitution of Ni ion by Mn ion, which has smaller radii, leading to lattice contraction.[29]

As shown in the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) in Figure S1, the precursors obtained after microwave heating of DES containing NiCl<sup>2</sup> · 6H2O (with or without Mn(NO<sup>3</sup> )2 · 4H2O) all exhibited a nanoflake morphology. After reflux treatment under alkaline conditions, the products displayed nanosheet morphologies (Figure S2, Figure 2c–2d), indicating that Mn doping had a negligible effect on the morphology. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of Mn-4Ni(OH)<sup>2</sup> further demonstrated the nanosheet structure (Figure 2e). In the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image of Mn-4Ni(OH)<sup>2</sup> nanosheets (Figure 2f), lattice fringe spacing of 0.232 nm was observed, corresponding to the (101) crystallographic planes of Ni(OH)<sup>2</sup> . Elemental mapping images in Figure 2g revealed that the Mn-4Ni(OH)<sup>2</sup> nanosheets contained uniformly distributed Ni, O, and Mn elements, indicating that Mn was successfully doped in Ni(OH)<sup>2</sup> . Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectra (Figure S3) demonstrated the Ni/ Mn atomic ratios of 2.9, 4.0, and 5.2 in the as-synthesized Mn-3Ni(OH)<sup>2</sup> , Mn-4Ni(OH)<sup>2</sup> , and Mn-5Ni(OH)<sup>2</sup> catalysts, closely matching the feed ratios.

The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) specific surface area and pore size distribution of Mn-doped Ni(OH)<sup>2</sup> catalysts were analyzed using N<sup>2</sup> adsorption-desorption experiments (Figure S4–S5). Based on the N<sup>2</sup> adsorption-desorption isotherms, the BET specific surface area of Mn-4Ni(OH)<sup>2</sup> was larger than Mn-3Ni(OH)<sup>2</sup> and Mn-5Ni(OH)<sup>2</sup> .

#### **2.2. X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) Analysis of Mn-Doped Ni(OH)<sup>2</sup> Nanosheets**

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurement provided detailed insights into the surface chemical composition and valence state of the as-prepared catalysts. The XPS survey spectrum of Mn-4Ni(OH)<sup>2</sup> nanosheets confirmed the Ni, Mn, and O elements (Figure 3a). The high-resolution Mn 2p spectrum (Figure 3b) indicated that Mn predominantly existed as Mn<sup>3</sup><sup>+</sup> , with Mn 2p3/2 at 641.5 eV, 637.4 eV and Mn 2p1/2 at 653.3 eV, demonstrating successful Mn doping into Ni(OH)<sup>2</sup> . [30,31] The high-resolution Ni 2p XPS spectrum displayed two pairs of spinorbit doublet peaks, with binding energies at 854.9 (Ni 2p3/2) and 872.5 eV (Ni 2p1/2) ascribed to Ni<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> , and additional nickel satellite peaks (Figure 3c).[32,33] The O 1s spectrum showed three peaks at 531.0 eV, 530.4 eV, and 529.9 eV, corresponding to

adsorbed H2O, M@OH, and M@O, respectively (Figure 3d).[34] In comparison with Ni(OH)<sup>2</sup> , the Ni 2p and O 1s peaks of Mn-4Ni(OH)<sup>2</sup> shifted to lower binding energies by 0.14 eV and 0.36 eV, respectively. The result suggested that Mn doping led to electron transfer from Mn sites to neighboring Ni and O sites, due to the differing electronegativities (O*>*Ni*>*Mn).

#### **2.3. Electrocatalytic Performance of Mn-Doped Ni(OH)<sup>2</sup> Nanosheets for HMF Electrooxidation**

To understand the electrocatalytic performance of the asprepared catalysts for HMF oxidation, linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) tests were performed for the electrodes from Ni(OH)<sup>2</sup> , Mn-3Ni(OH)<sup>2</sup> , Mn-4Ni(OH)<sup>2</sup> , and Mn-5Ni(OH)<sup>2</sup> electrocatalysts in a 1.0 M KOH electrolyte containing 10 mM HMF. All potentials were converted to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). From Figure 4a and Figure S6, Mn-4Ni(OH)<sup>2</sup> demonstrated the lowest onset potential (1.30 V) and the highest current density (89.22 mVcm@<sup>2</sup> ) at the same potential, indicating superior catalytic performance. Additionally, the LSV curves of Mn-4Ni(OH)<sup>2</sup> were compared for the HMF oxidation reaction (HMFOR) in the presence of 10 mM HMF and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in the absence of HMF (a competing reaction for HMFOR). Figure S7 revealed that HMF oxidation was thermodynamically more favorable than water oxidation when using Mn-4Ni(OH)<sup>2</sup> as the catalyst.

To further understand the catalytic kinetics of HMFOR, the Tafel slope was calculated, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was measured for the catalysts. Figure 4b showed that Mn-4Ni(OH)<sup>2</sup> possessed a Tafel slope of 28.14 mVdec@<sup>1</sup> , lower than Mn-5Ni(OH)<sup>2</sup> (29.45 mVdec@<sup>1</sup> ), Mn-3Ni(OH)<sup>2</sup> (35.93 mVdec@<sup>1</sup> ) and Ni(OH)<sup>2</sup> (40.03 mVdec@<sup>1</sup> ). Specifically, the Tafel slope of Mn-4Ni(OH)<sup>2</sup> is only 0.7 times that of Ni(OH)2. The present Tafel slopes were achieved from potentiodynamic LSV data. While the potentiodynamic LSV method is widely used to determine Tafel slopes, we acknowledge its limitations due to the inclusion of non-Faradaic currents.[35–37] The Nyquist plot from EIS measurements was shown in Figure 4c. An optimal circuit model was utilized to fit the EIS data (Figure S8 and Table S1). R<sup>p</sup> (in the high-frequency region) represents the resistance associated with internal electrode oxidation. As shown in Table S1, the R<sup>p</sup> of Mn-4Ni(OH)<sup>2</sup> (0.0086 Ω) is significantly lower than that of NiOH (0.0189 Ω), indicating superior internal electrode oxidation performance. The electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) was assessed to achieve insights into the intrinsic activity of the catalysts. The electrochemical double-layer capacitance (Cdl) values, derived from cyclic voltammetry curves (Figure S9), were used to calculate ECSA (Figure 4d). Results showed that Mn-4Ni(OH)<sup>2</sup>

had the highest ECSA value of 4.0 cm<sup>2</sup> , compared to Mn-5Ni(OH)<sup>2</sup> (3.7 cm<sup>2</sup> ), Mn-3Ni(OH)<sup>2</sup> (2.5 cm<sup>2</sup> ), and Ni(OH)<sup>2</sup> (1.7 cm<sup>2</sup> ). The higher ECSA of Mn-4Ni(OH)<sup>2</sup> suggested more exposed catalytically active sites. Therefore, the Mn-4Ni(OH)<sup>2</sup> catalyst, with its abundant electrocatalytic active sites and enhanced electron transfer capabilities, was utilized for the subsequent electrochemical studies of HMF.

#### **2.4. Electrooxidation Efficiency of Mn-Doped Ni(OH)<sup>2</sup> Nanosheets for Converting HMF to FDCA**

The oxidation of HMF can proceed via two distinct pathways due to the aldehyde and hydroxyl groups in its structure.[38] As illustrated in Figure S10, the first pathway favors the aldehyde group oxidation, resulting in 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furancarboxylic acid (HMFCA) as an intermediate. The second pathway prioritizes the hydroxyl group oxidation, leading to the 2,5 diformylfuran (DFF) as an intermediate. Both intermediates can be further converted to 5-formyl-2-furancarboxylic acid (FFCA) and finally oxidized into FDCA.

To investigate the electrooxidation performance of the Mn-4Ni(OH)<sup>2</sup> catalyst, a solution containing 1.0 M KOH and 10 mM HMF was electrolyzed at 1.44 V. At lower potentials (below 1.44 V), the current response was smaller, indicating lower efficiency, while higher potentials (above 1.44 V) led to visible oxygen formation at the electrode. Thus, we selected a moderate potential of 1.44 V for the electrolysis experiments. The concentration changes of organic compounds during the HMFOR process were monitored by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). As the oxidation of HMF to FDCA requires six electrons, theoretically, 58 C is needed for complete conversion (10 mL, 10 mM HMF). Figure 5a showed that the current density gradually reduced when the passed charge increased. The electrolyte color changed from yellow to colorless during this period, as shown in the inset of Figure 5a. HPLC analysis of the electrooxidation process revealed the presence of HMF, HMFCA, FFCA, and FDCA, with no detection of DFF intermediates (Figure 5b). This indicated that the electrooxidation of HMF by Mn-4Ni(OH)<sup>2</sup> followed pathway 1. Based on the standard HPLC curves (Figure S11), Figure 5c displayed the relationship between the concentration of HMF, intermediates and FDCA during electrolysis and the passing charge. After

passing 58 C, HMF was completely consumed, and FDCA concentration was maximized. The yield of FDCA was calculated to be 99.0%, with a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 98.8%, demonstrating superior HMF electrocatalytic performance compared to most catalysts (Table S2).

Stability is a crucial criterion for evaluating the application potential of electrocatalysts. The Mn-4Ni(OH)<sup>2</sup> electrode's stability was assessed by conducting six consecutive HMF oxidation tests at 1.44 V. As shown in Figure 5d, there was negligible decrease in HMF conversion, FDCA yield, and FE throughout the repeated cycles, demonstrating the excellent durability of Mn-4Ni(OH)<sup>2</sup> catalyst for HMFOR. Further characterization of the Mn-4Ni(OH)<sup>2</sup> electrocatalyst after stability testing was performed using TEM, XRD, and XPS techniques. TEM analysis revealed that the overall morphology of the electrocatalysts retained their nanosheet structure after the HMF electrooxidation reaction (Figure S12a–S12b). Comparing the XRD and XPS patterns before and after HMFOR indicated that the chemical composition of the catalysts remained almost unchanged (Figure S12c–S12f). These results confirmed that Mn-4Ni(OH)<sup>2</sup> is an efficient and stable electrocatalyst.

#### **2.5. Mechanistic Insights into Enhanced HMF Electrooxidation by Mn-Doped Ni(OH)<sup>2</sup> Nanosheets**

To elucidate the efficient catalytic mechanism of Mn-4Ni(OH)<sup>2</sup> in the oxidation of HMF, we performed open-circuit potential (OCP) measurement and density functional theory (DFT) calculation.[39] The OCP method helps evaluate the adsorption of HMF on the catalyst's surface due to changes in the Helmholtz layer caused by ion and adsorbate exchanges. In the OCP test, we used a 50 mM HMF concentration instead of the 10 mM concentration used in other experiments. This was done to enhance the visibility of the OCP changes. Although the results at 10 mM were consistent with those at 50 mM, the higher concentration allowed for more noticeable shifts in OCP. As shown in Figure 6a, introducing 50 mM HMF into the electrolyte resulted in a more significant decrease in the OCP for Mn-4Ni(OH)<sup>2</sup> (0.15 V) compared to Ni(OH)<sup>2</sup> (0.12 V). This larger potential difference suggested that Mn-4Ni(OH)<sup>2</sup> possessed stronger adsorption ability for HMF, contributing to its superior catalytic performance in HMFOR. To further understand the promotion mechanism of Mn doping for Ni(OH)<sup>2</sup> in HMFOR, DFT calculations were performed. The (101) surface of Ni(OH)<sup>2</sup> and Mn-4Ni(OH)<sup>2</sup> was selected to construct the optimal structures for these catalysts (Figure S13, Tables S4-S5). The adsorption of HMF on these surfaces was modeled (Figure S14, Tables S6–S8), and their respective adsorption energies were

calculated (Table S3). The results showed that Mn doping introduced new active sites on the catalyst surface, significantly lowering the adsorption energies of HMF. Specifically, the adsorption energies of HMF on the Mn site (@1.47 eV) and the Ni site (@1.36 eV) of Mn-4Ni(OH)<sup>2</sup> are lower than on the Ni site of Ni(OH)<sup>2</sup> (@1.28 eV) (Figure 6b–6c). This reduced adsorption energy facilitates a higher local concentration of HMF on Mn-4Ni(OH)<sup>2</sup> , enhancing the electrochemical activity in the initial

step of HMF electrooxidation. Through these DFT results, we identified the active sites involved in HMF oxidation on Mn-4Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>: both the Mn and Ni sites serve as key active centers. The Mn site, in particular, plays a significant role due to the electron transfer from Mn to adjacent Ni and O sites, which enhances the adsorption of HMF. Further insights into the catalytic activity were gained from charge density difference plots (Figure 6d). In these plots, yellow regions indicate electron accumulation while cyan regions denote electron depletion. The Mn doping into the Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> structure alters its electronic properties. Electrons are transferred from the Mn sites to adjacent Ni and O sites. This observation agrees with the XPS analysis. The creation of electron holes at the Mn and Ni sites facilitates the adsorption of HMF, thereby accelerating the HMFOR process. Hence, DFT calculations validated that Mn doping played a crucial role in modifying the electronic structure of Ni(OH)2, optimizing HMF adsorption, and creating new active sites for HMF reaction.

#### 3. Conclusions

In summary, this study demonstrates the successful synthesis and application of Mn-doped Ni(OH) $_2$  nanosheets as an efficient electrocatalyst for the electrooxidation of HMF to FDCA. The designed Mn-doped Ni(OH) $_2$  nanosheets demonstrated exceptional catalytic performance, achieving 100% HMF conversion, 99.0% FDCA yield, and 98.8% FE at 1.44 V. The DFT calculations elucidated the role of Mn doping in augmenting the catalytic activity. The key to this enhanced performance is that the Mn doping induces surface charge redistribution and electron hole formation, thereby enhancing HMF adsorption and facilitating its oxidation. This work not only advances the understanding of Mn doping in Ni(OH) $_2$  for biomass conversion but also offers a robust electrocatalyst for HMF electrooxidation.

#### **Experimental**

# Preparation of Choline Chloride/Oxalic Acid (ChCl/OA) Deep Eutectic Solvent (DES)

The deep eutectic solvent (DES) was prepared according to the literature. [40] Typically, ChCl/OA DES was synthesized by stirring equimolar amounts of choline chloride (ChCl) and oxalic acid (OA) at 80 °C until a transparent liquid was achieved.

#### Fabrication of Mn-Doped Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> Nanosheets

Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> catalysts with different Mn doping amount were labeled as Mn-xNi(OH)<sub>2</sub>, where x represents the initial feed atomic ratio of Ni/Mn salt. Typically, for preparation of Mn-4Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> as an example, 0.033 mmol Mn(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>·4H<sub>2</sub>O and 0.133 mmol NiCl<sub>2</sub>·6H<sub>2</sub>O were dissolved in 1 mL ChCl/OA DES and subjected to ultrasonication at 50 °C. The solution was subsequently moved to a microwave oven and microwaved at 100 W for 15 s to obtain the Mn/Ni-based precursors. Then, the precursors were recovered, rinsed with ethanol and dried in vacuum at room temperature overnight.

After that, the dried precursors (100 mg) were dispersed in 2 M KOH solution (15 mL) and refluxed at 100 °C for 2 hours. Finally, the product was recovered by centrifugation and washed with water and ethanol. The recovered product was dried in vacuum to obtain the black Mn-4Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> product. For comparison, the Mn-3Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> and Mn-5Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> were also prepared using the same procedure as above. Additionally, Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> was also synthesized.

#### **Electrochemical Measurements**

Electrochemical testing was conducted on the electrochemical workstation (CHI Model 760E). For preparation of catalyst ink, 4 mg catalyst was first added to the mixture containing Nafion solution (20  $\mu L$ , 5 wt%), ethanol (100  $\mu L$ ), and water (80  $\mu L$ ). The mixture was treated by ultrasound to form a homogeneous suspension. Finally, the catalyst suspension was coated on the carbon paper (1×1 cm², loading of 4 mg cm²²). Saturated Ag/AgCl electrode, carbon rod and catalyst-loaded carbon paper were served as reference electrode, counter electrode, and working electrode. All potentials were normalized to reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) by below formula:

$$E (RHE) = E (Ag/AgCI) + 0.197 + 0.059 \times pH$$
 (1)

The solution of 1.0 M KOH (10 mL, with or without 10 mM HMF) was used as the electrolyte. Electrooxidation performance of the catalysts was studied through chronoamperometry at 1.44 V. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was conducted with 10 mV s $^{-1}$ . 1 Hz to 100 kHz frequencies were used for electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) characterization, and the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) were calculated based on the double layer capacitance ( $C_{\rm cl}$ ) by following equation:

$$ECSA = C_{dl}/C_{s}$$
 (2)

here  $C_{dl}$  values were obtained from cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves, and  $C_s$  was adopted as 40  $\mu F\,cm^{-2}.$ 

#### **Products Analysis**

Specifically, 10  $\mu$ L of electrolyte solution during chronoamperometry at 1.44 V was taken out and diluted to 0.5 mL for high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) characterization. HPLC was equipped with a Welch Xtimate-C18 column (4.6 mm×150 mm, 5  $\mu$ m, 265 nm detection wavelength). The eluent was a mixture of 5 mM ammonium acetate and methanol (7:3) with 0.7 mL min<sup>-1</sup>.

HMF conversion, FDCA yield, and Faraday efficiency (FE) were achieved using below equations.

$$[n (HMF_{consumed})/n (HMF_{initial})] \times 100$$

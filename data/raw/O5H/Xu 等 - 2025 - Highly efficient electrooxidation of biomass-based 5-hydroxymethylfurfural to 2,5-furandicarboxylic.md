High-performance copper/nickel@phytic acid hybrids (Cu-Ni(x)@PA) using plant-originated phytic acid as a building block were constructed for the electrooxidation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural to 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid. The optimized Cu-Ni(2)@PA shows excellent performance with high faradaic efficiency (96.7%) and selectivity (97.5%). The mechanism behind such high efficiency was revealed.

The conversion of renewable biomass resources to high-valueadded chemicals is one of the most promising strategies for a green and sustainable future, and has received increasing attention recently. 5-Hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) derived from the dehydration of C-6 sugars has been regarded as a multi-purpose compound in the field of biorefinery. In particular, upgrading HMF to 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) is one of the most important reactions in the field of biomass-based industry.<sup>2</sup> FDCA is a key intermediate to replace petroleum-based products for the synthesis of biopolymers and energy-related chemicals.<sup>2</sup> Among the various catalytic strategies, the electrooxidation of HMF to FDCA has been recognized as an efficient approach to replace traditional aerobic oxidation.3 The reason is that the process is usually performed under mild conditions (e.g., ambient temperatures and with H<sub>2</sub>O as the oxygen source), avoiding the use of high pressure O2 and toxic oxidants.

In the process of the electrooxidation of HMF to FDCA, two pathways are usually involved (Fig. 1). One pathway involves the oxidation of the HMF alcohol group to diformylfuran (DFF) as the intermediate. The other pathway involves the formation of 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furancarboxylic acid (HMFCA) as

intermediate by the oxidation of the HMF aldehyde group. Therefore, boosting the oxidation of the alcohol or aldehyde groups is very important. Recently, metal-based electrocatalysts, such as metal sulfides, N-doped carbon supported metals, metal oxides, and metal hydroxides, have been explored for HMF oxidation.4 In particular, the Ni-based catalysts are the most promising electrocatalysts for the synthesis of FDCA by HMF oxidation.<sup>5</sup> The reason is that the Ni<sup>2+</sup> species or the in situ formed Ni<sup>3+</sup> species can catalyze the conversion of aldehyde to carboxylic acid and alcohol to aldehyde. 6 However, the oxidation of aldehyde to carboxylic acid is much more difficult than the oxidation of alcohol to aldehyde, 7-9 and single metal-based catalysts still face the disadvantages of insufficient active sites, weak adsorption of HMF, and high oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity, thereby resulting in unsatisfactory performance. Recent studies have revealed that Cu-based catalysts can enhance the conversion of aldehyde to carboxylic acid and weaken the OER activity. 9,10 Inspired by these findings, we can conjecture that constructing bimetallic Cu-Ni synergistical centers might be an effective approach to improve the oxidation performance of HMF.

In recent years, the use of natural resources to construct functional materials has attracted widespread attention in the field of catalysis. Phytic acid (PA) derived from natural resources, such as seeds and grains, is a natural organic acid. Owning to the existence of phosphate groups in its molecular structure (Fig. 2a), it can serve as an adsorbent to remove metal ions in aqueous solution through coordination interaction. 11 In addition, PA contains twelve acidic protons, which can be used as a dopant and

proton carrier to enhance the conductivity of materials, thus accelerating electron transfer. In this regard, constructing functional materials using PA as a dopant for the electrooxidation of HMF to FDCA is highly desirable.

Herein, bimetallic Cu-Ni(x)@PA hybrids (x represents the molar ratio of Cu to Ni) were designed, using PA and copper/nickel salts as the precursors, as highly efficient electrocatalysts for HMF oxidation. The optimized Cu-Ni(2)@PA exhibits excellent performance for the electrochemical oxidation of HMF to FDCA, with high faradaic efficiency (96.7%) and high selectivity (97.5%). Mechanism study reveals that the incorporation of Cu in Cu-Ni(2)@PA can weaken the competitive OER and induce the formation of electrondeficient Ni<sup> $\delta$ +</sup> (2 <  $\delta$  < 3) species, thus promoting the formation of Ni<sup>3+</sup> active species and the adsorption of HMF. Meanwhile, the doping of PA can accelerate electron transfer and enhance the exposure of the active sites, thus boosting the reaction kinetics of HMF oxidation. This study opens a new pathway for the development of high-performance electrocatalysts derived from natural resources for biomass conversion, and provides new insights into the biomass conversion mechanisms.

Cu-Ni(x) a PA hybrids were prepared through a facile coprecipitation method. As depicted in Fig. 2a, a certain molar ratio of copper acetate and nickel acetate was added into an aqueous solution to form a homogeneous solution. Then, a suitable amount of PA was introduced into the mixture. Afterwards, a blue solid was formed through coordination interaction between metal ions and PA. Finally, the resultant solid was dried to obtain Cu-Ni(x) a PA hybrids. By altering the molar ratio of Cu to Ni, several Cu-Ni(x)@PA hybrids including Cu-Ni(2)@PA, Cu-Ni(1)@PA and Cu-Ni(0.5)@PA were obtained. For comparison, the single metal@PA hybrids (Cu@PA and Ni@PA) were also prepared through a similar method. The detailed preparation procedures are described in the ESI.†

The morphology of the Cu-Ni(x) appa hybrids was investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As shown in Fig. 2b and c, Cu-Ni(2)@PA exhibits an irregular agglomerated nanoparticle. Other control samples,

including Cu-Ni(1)@PA, Cu-Ni(0.5)@PA, Cu@PA, and Ni@PA, show a morphology similar to that of Cu-Ni(2)@PA (Fig. S1-S4, ESI†). The energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy mapping patterns of Cu-Ni(2)@PA indicate the uniform distribution of the C, O, Cu, Ni, and P elements in the entire material (Fig. 2d-j). The structural characteristics of the Cu-Ni(x)@PA hybrids were investigated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). As shown in Fig. S5-S9 (ESI†), the Cu-Ni(x)@PA hybrids show the characteristic peaks at 1000-1150 cm<sup>-1</sup> and 1637 cm<sup>-1</sup>, attributable to the phosphate and phosphate hydrogen groups, 12,13 respectively, indicating the presence of PA in Cu-Ni(x) (a) PA. In addition, the peaks at 550-600 cm<sup>-1</sup> are assigned to the linkage between metal and oxygen of PA.14 Furthermore, X-ray diffraction (XRD) was employed to study the crystalline structure of Cu-Ni(x)@PA hybrids. As shown in Fig. S10-S14 (ESI†), broad peaks are observed, indicating an amorphous structure of Cu-Ni(x)@PA hybrids, possibly due to the formation of a complex structure and an aperiodic array of metal and PA ligands. 15 N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms were used to study the porous structure and specific surface areas of the Cu-Ni(x)@PA hybrids (Fig. S15a, S16, and S17, ESI†). The results indicate that the Cu-Ni(x)@PA hybrids display a porous structure and high specific surface areas for Cu-Ni(0.5)@PA (211.6 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>), Cu-Ni(1)@PA (225.9 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>), and Cu-Ni(2)@PA (293.3 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>), respectively (Table S1, ESI†). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was employed to study the elemental valence state of the Cu-Ni(x)@PA hybrids. Taking Cu-Ni(2)@PA as an example, the signals of C 1s, O 1s, Cu 2p, Ni 2p, and P 2p are discerned in Fig. S18 (ESI†). The high-resolution XPS spectrum of Cu 2p in Cu-Ni(2)@PA (Fig. S15b, ESI†) shows two main peaks of 934 eV and 953.6 eV, which are attributed to Cu 2p<sub>3/2</sub> and Cu 2p<sub>1/2</sub> of Cu<sup>2+</sup>, respectively. The peaks at binding energies of 942.1 eV and 962.3 eV can be recognized as the characteristic satellite peaks of Cu<sup>2+</sup>.16 The high-resolution XPS spectrum of Ni 2p in Cu-Ni(2)@PA (Fig. S15c, ESI†) exhibits two main peaks of 856.16 eV and 874.09 eV, corresponding to Ni 2p<sub>3/2</sub> and Ni 2p<sub>1/2</sub>, respectively. Meanwhile, two shakeup satellite peaks of 862 eV and 879.66 eV are deduced to be from Ni  $2p_{3/2}$  and Ni  $2p_{1/2}$ , indicating the existence of Ni<sup>2+</sup>.<sup>17</sup> Fig. S15d (ESI<sup>†</sup>) shows the highresolution spectrum of P 2p, which can be fitted into P 2p<sub>1/2</sub> and P  $2p_{3/2}$ . From Fig. S19 (ESI†), the peaks of C-O, O-P, P=O, O-Ni, and O-Cu can be observed clearly, indicating that the metal is connected to the O of PA.

The electrocatalytic performance of the Cu-Ni(x)@PA hybrids for HMF oxidation was studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV). As shown in Fig. S20-S24 (ESI†), an obvious increase in the current density over Cu-Ni(x)@PA is observed after adding HMF, suggesting the occurrence of HMF oxidation. In addition, the OER, a competitive reaction of HMF oxidation, has a significant effect on the HMF oxidation. Fig. S25 (ESI†) shows that Ni@PA displays the highest of OER current density at 2.2 V vs. RHE among these samples, indicating a strong OER activity. With an increase in the molar ratio of Cu to Ni in Cu-Ni(x)@PA, the current density of the OER reduces, indicating that the incorporation of Cu in Cu-Ni(x)@PA is helpful to weaken the deprotonation of the \*OH species (derived from the water dissociation) to O\* and thereby the OER process is greatly passivated. This phenomenon is similar to the reported ones that Cu contributes to impeding the OER.10 In addition, the Ni3+ species often act as the

active sites of HMF oxidation. 18 Under the same scan number of CV, the oxidation peak position of Ni<sup>2+</sup> → Ni<sup>3+</sup> species decreases with the increase of the Cu content in Cu-Ni(x)@PA (Fig. S25, ESI $\dagger$ ), indicating that the doping of Cu2+ contributes to promoting the oxidation of Ni<sup>2+</sup> species, which is consistent with the results of the subsequent mechanism study (where the introduction of Cu<sup>2+</sup> into Cu-Ni(x)@PA hybrids can induce the formation of electron-deficient  $Ni^{\delta+}$  (2 <  $\delta$  < 3), thus promoting the oxidation of  $Ni^{2+} \rightarrow Ni^{3+}$ ). In addition, due to the similarity in the structure between the Cu-Ni(x)@PA hybrids and the metal organic hybrids, the Cu-Ni(x)@PA hybrids are prone to exposing active metal sites and promoting more contact between metal and O-containing species (e.g., CHO, OH, etc.), 19,20 exhibiting great potential for HMF oxidation. Therefore, utilizing the synergistic effect of bimetallic Cu-Ni active sites and reasonably adjusting the ratio of Cu to Ni in Cu-Ni(x)@PA are expected to enhance the reaction kinetics between HMF and \*OH, and weaken \*OH itself producing O2, and thus can accelerate the oxidation process of HMF.

The effect of applied potential on the HMF oxidation over Cu-Ni(x)@PA was performed (Fig. 3a and Fig. S26–S36, ESI†). The stoichiometric amount of charge required to completely convert 0.27 mmol of HMF to FDCA is 156.2C. In this work, the product analysis was obtained at 156C. As shown in Fig. 3a and b, at a low applied potential (1.9 V), the conversion of HMF can reach 98.4%, while the faradaic efficiency and selectivity of FDCA are lower, at 78.3% and 79.5%, respectively. Meanwhile, a small amount of HMFCA is also obtained with low faradaic efficiency (3.8%) and selectivity (11.7%). When the applied potential increases to 2.1 V, the faradaic efficiency and selectivity of FDCA reach 96.7% and 97.5%, respectively, while the faradaic efficiency of HMFCA is less than 2%, indicating that HMFCA can be converted to FDCA. With a continuous increase in potential, the faradaic efficiency of FDCA decreases to 87%, while the selectivity of FDCA maintains at 97% at 2.3 V vs. RHE. This decrease can be attributed to the acceleration of the competitive OER at higher potentials, 10 thus resulting in the reduced faradaic efficiency of FDCA. Thus, it can be concluded that

2.1 V is an optimal potential for the electrooxidation of HMF to FDCA. For comparison, the catalytic performance of other control samples including Cu-Ni(1)@PA, Cu-Ni(0.5)@PA, Cu@PA, and Ni@PA for HMF oxidation was also evaluated (Fig. S27-S34, ESI†).

Fig. 3c shows the performance comparison of the different Cu-Ni(x)@PA samples for the electrooxidation of HMF at 2.1 V. It can be observed that a low conversion of HMF (45.3%) is obtained over Ni@PA. Meanwhile, poor faradaic efficiency (25.1%) and selectivity (56.8%) of FDCA are observed. In addition, although Cu@PA exhibits a high conversion of HMF (92.9%), the faradaic efficiency and selectivity of FDCA are only 51.6% and 55.5%, respectively. The reason can be attributed to the known instability of HMF in a strongly basic solution that easily induces the production of humin through oxidative polymerization, especially under electrochemical oxidation conditions, where the loss of HMF would be further expedited.<sup>21</sup> With the doping of Cu in the Cu-Ni(x)@PA hybrids, the selectivity of FDCA increases. In particular, Cu-Ni(2)@PA exhibits superior performance with high faradaic efficiency (96.6%) and selectivity (97.5%) of FDCA among the Cu-Ni(x)@PA samples, indicating that the synergistic effect of Cu and Ni as well as their appropriate molar ratio play key roles in boosting the efficiency of FDCA. In addition, the cycling stability of Cu-Ni(2)@PA was also investigated. From Fig. 3d, only a slight decline in the faradaic efficiency and selectivity of FDCA is observed after four catalytic cycles, and high faradaic efficiency (90.8%) and selectivity (93.2%) are retained. FT-IR and XPS spectra were employed to characterize the used Cu-Ni(2)@PA, and the corresponding results are shown in Fig. S37 and S38 (ESI†).

To gain insight into the role of Cu-Ni(2)@PA in the HMF electrooxidation, the local environment of Cu and Ni species in Cu-Ni(2)@PA was investigated. As shown in Fig. 4a and Fig. S39 (ESI†), the binding energy of Ni 2p in Ni-Cu(2)@PA (856.16 eV and 874.09 eV) is higher than that of Ni@PA (854.86 eV and 872.71 eV), but lower than that of Ni3+ (858.6 eV and 875.8),22 indicating the existence of Ni<sup> $\delta$ +</sup> (2 <  $\delta$  < 3). In addition, there is no obvious change in Cu 2p, indicating that the introduction of the Cu element in Cu-Ni(2)@PA can alter the electronic structure of the PA group, thus inducing the formation of an electron-deficient Ni<sup> $\delta$ +</sup> (2 <  $\delta$  < 3). Meanwhile, the Mulliken charge analysis from the electronic density distribution calculation indicates that the electronic density of Ni in Cu-Ni(2)@PA is biased towards the PA ring in comparison to Ni@PA (Fig. 4b). According to the literature, 23 the electrondeficient Ni<sup>δ+</sup> species contribute to enhancing the adsorption of the electron-rich oxygen in the carbonyl group of HMF, thus promoting the HMF oxidation.

To investigate the role of PA, trimesic acid (BTC) and amino tri(methylene phosphonic acid) (ATMP) were selected as control ligands to construct Cu-Ni(2)@BTC and Cu-Ni(2)@ATMP, respectively, for the electrocatalytic oxidation of HMF. The corresponding characterization results are shown in Fig. S40 and S41 (ESI†). From Fig. S42a (ESI†), Cu-Ni(2)@PA exhibits a stronger response for HMF oxidation with a high current density in comparison to those of Cu-Ni(2)@BTC and Cu-Ni(2)@ATMP. Meanwhile, Cu-Ni(2)@PA delivers the best performance with higher faradaic efficiency (96.7%) and selectivity (97.5%) than those of Cu-Ni(2)@BTC (faradaic efficiency: 77.4%; selectivity: 78.6%) and Cu-Ni(2)@ATMP (faradaic

efficiency: 89.2%; selectivity: 92.2%) (Fig. S42b, ESI<sup>+</sup>), indicating that the incorporation of PA contributes to enhancing the activity of the Cu-Ni centers. In addition, Cu-Ni(2)@PA has a lower Tafel slope  $(169.36 \text{ mV dec}^{-1})$  than that of Cu-Ni(2)@BTC  $(337.7 \text{ mV dec}^{-1})$ and Cu-Ni(2)@ATMP (318.94 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>), indicating that the doping of PA is helpful to accelerate the reaction kinetics of the HMF oxidation (Fig. S42c, ESI†). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) shows that Cu-Ni(2)@PA displays the smallest semicircle among these catalysts (Fig. S42d, ESI†), indicating that the incorporation of PA can promote the charge transfer rate at the electrocatalyst/electrolyte interface, which can accelerate the oxidation of HMF. Meanwhile, N<sub>2</sub> adsorption-desorption analysis (Table S2, ESI†) shows that Cu-Ni(2)@PA possesses a higher specific surface area (293.3 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>) in comparison to those of Cu-Ni(2)@BTC  $(81.1 \text{ m}^2 \text{ g}^{-1})$  and Cu-Ni(2)@ATMP (86.8 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>), indicating that the doping of PA can enhance the exposure of the Cu-Ni active sites. The ammonia temperature-programmed desorption analysis (Fig. S43, ESI†) shows that Cu-Ni(2)@PA possesses a stronger Lewis acidity than that of Cu-Ni(2)@ATMP and Cu-Ni(2)@BTC, which is beneficial for the adsorption of the electron-rich carbonyl group of HMF, thus improving the selectivity of FDCA.

In the electrochemical oxidation of HMF to FDCA over Cu-Ni(x)@PA, the HMFCA and DFF intermediates were detected (Fig. S44, ESI†). Therefore, it can be concluded that the electrochemical oxidation of HMF to FDCA involves two pathways (Fig. 1). According to the literature, <sup>2</sup> aldehyde prefers to be oxidized to the carboxylate group in a strong alkaline solution due to its higher reactivity than the hydroxymethyl group. Meanwhile, the experimental results show that HMFCA is observed at a slightly higher concentration than that of DFF, suggesting that the reaction proceeds predominantly via the HMFCA pathway.

In summary, biomass-based Cu-Ni(x)@PA hybrids were constructed using PA as a linkable block, through a simple co-precipitation strategy. The optimized Cu-Ni(2)@PA exhibits an excellent performance for the electrochemical oxidation of HMF to FDCA, with high faradaic efficiency (96.7%) and selectivity (97.5%). Mechanism study unveils that the introduction of Cu in Cu-Ni(x)@PA can weaken the competitive OER and induce the formation of electron-deficient Ni<sup> $\delta$ +</sup> (2 <  $\delta$  < 3) species, thus promoting the formation of Ni<sup>3+</sup> species and the adsorption of HMF. In addition, the doping of PA can accelerate electron transfer and increase active site exposure, thus boosting the reaction kinetics of HMF oxidation. This study

opens a new avenue for the development of high-performance electrocatalysts based on the natural resources for biomass conversion, and provides deep insights into the complex mechanisms of biomass conversion.

*Xin*−*Yu Zhang, Sheng-Song Yu, Jie-Jie Chen,\* Kun Gao, Han-Qing Yu, and Yan Yu\**

**Electrocatalytic biomass conversion offers a sustainable route for producing organic chemicals, with electrode design being critical to determining reaction rate and selectivity. Herein, a prediction-synthesis-validation approach is developed to obtain electrodes for precise biomass conversion, where the coexistence of multiple metal valence states leads to excellent electrocatalytic performance due to the activated redox cycle. This promising integrated foam electrode is developed via acid-induced surface reconstruction to in situ generate highly active metal (oxy)hydroxide or oxide (MOxHy or MOx) species on inert foam electrodes, facilitating the electrooxidation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF) to 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA). Taking nickel foam electrode as an example, the resulting NiOxHy/Ni catalyst, featuring the coexistence of multivalent states of Ni, exhibits remarkable activity and stability with a FDCA yields over 95% and a Faradaic efficiency of 99%. In situ Raman spectroscopy and theoretical analysis reveal an Ni(OH)2/NiOOH-mediated indirect pathway, with the chemical oxidation of 5-HMF as the rate-limiting step. Furthermore, this in situ surface reconstruction approach can be extended to various metal foams (Fe, Cu, FeNi, and NiMo), offering a mild, scalable, and cost-effective method for preparing potent foam catalysts. This approach promotes a circular economy by enabling more efficient biomass conversion processes, providing a versatile and impactful tool in the field of sustainable catalysis.**

# **1. Introduction**

Driven by both energy insecurity and environmental concerns, the need for clean, renewable energy to replace fossil fuels is becoming increasingly urgent.[\[1\]](#page-11-0) Biomass, with its abundance, sustainability, global distribution, and scalability, stands out as a particularly attractive feedstock for this transition.[\[2\]](#page-11-0) Electrocatalytic refineries present a sustainable alternative to traditional fossil-fuel-based refineries by utilizing electricity to directly convert biomass into valuable fuels and chemicals. Electrocatalysis stands out among biomass conversion approaches for its ability to operate under mild conditions, such as ambient temperature and pressure, while allowing precise control over reaction pathways.[\[2c,3\]](#page-11-0) These features make electrocatalytic processes particularly attractive for the efficient and selective transformation of biomass into high-value products.

To achieve high efficiency and selectivity in electrocatalytic reactions, electrodes should exhibit high catalytic activity, operational stability, and efficient electron transfer capabilities.[\[4\]](#page-11-0) Transition metal oxyhydroxides (MOOH)

comprising 3*d* transition metals have emerged as particularly promising electrode materials due to their feasible modulation of the reaction process.[\[5\]](#page-11-0) Specifically, the adsorption energies of intermediate species can be finely tuned by introducing various metal elements that modulate the electronic structure.[\[6\]](#page-11-0) Transition metal-based oxyhydroxides, such as nickel oxyhydroxide (NiOOH) and cobalt oxyhydroxide (CoOOH), are known for their excellent catalytic properties and stability in redox reactions. Particularly, Ni-based catalysts have demonstrated exceptional catalytic activity in the electrocatalytic oxidation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF), a key biomass-derived platform molecule, often achieving near-quantitative conversion to 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA).[\[7\]](#page-11-0) Of all the oxidative derivatives, FDCA is recognized as a benchmark molecule and a potential substitute for terephthalic acid in producing polyesters, polyamides, and polyurethanes.[\[8\]](#page-11-0) Moreover, NiOxHy (Ni(OH)2/NiOOH) has been identified as the predominant active species for 5-HMF oxidation reaction (HMFOR).[\[9\]](#page-11-0) Despite

progress in electrocatalytic biomass conversion, several challenges persist in catalyst design. Achieving high efficiency and selectivity remains a significant hurdle, as it requires precise tuning of catalyst electronic properties and reaction pathways. Multivalent state catalysts, such as Ni<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup>/Ni<sup>3</sup><sup>+</sup>-based systems, exhibit superior catalytic properties. However, their synthesis is often hindered by complex, multistep procedures and harsh conditions, limiting practical applications. Additionally, the scalability of catalyst fabrication poses additional challenges. Traditional powdered catalysts lack durability and integration with electrodes, while scalable methods for fabricating catalyst-integrated electrodes remain limited by high costs and energy-intensive processes.

Understanding the underlying reaction mechanism is crucial for designing superior catalysts. Unlike traditional HMFOR processes, which require high temperatures and oxygen and result in significant environmental and operational challenges (**Figure 1**a), electrocatalysis enables theoretical analysis and precise tuning of catalyst properties (Figure 1b).[\[10\]](#page-11-0) This approach provides deeper insights into the reaction pathways, leading to the development of more effective catalytic systems. Electrocatalytic HMFOR would offer a more efficient, energy-conserving alternative by achieving impressive selectivity and yield under ambient conditions, representing an advancement in sustainable chemical processing and offering a greener and more efficient alternative to traditional methods.[\[11\]](#page-11-0)

In this work, we first used density functional theory (DFT) calculations to evaluate the adsorption and catalytic abilities of different NiOxHy species catalytic sites for 5-HMF. Subsequently, we developed a facile, cost-effective acid-induced method to convert inert Ni foams into highly efficient NiOOH/Ni(OH)2/Ni integrated foam electrodes via surface reconstruction and chemical oxidation (Figure 1c). The resulting electrodes exhibited exceptional performance in the conversion of 5-HMF to FDCA with robust cycling durability and exceptional Faradaic efficiency. Additionally, the underlying reaction mechanism was elucidated via a synergistic approach combining in situ Raman spectroscopy with theoretical calculations. This acid-induced approach proved effective not only with various acids but also in activating different commercial metal or alloy foams to enhance their activity for HMFOR, demonstrating its universality and practicality. Thus, this work provides a new perspective on the catalytic behavior of integrated metal foam electrodes containing multiple valence

states in biomass conversion and lays the foundation for developing efficient and renewable biomass conversion catalysts.

## **2. Results and Discussion**

#### **2.1. Screening HMFOR Catalysts via DFT Calculations**

To investigate the HMFOR at the molecular level, DFT computational screening was employed to expedite catalyst exploration, significantly reducing experimental time by enabling systematic investigations. Here, NiOxHy structures with various valence states of Ni were constructed, and their adsorption capabilities to the substrate, along with their predicted catalytic performances, were compared using DFT calculations. By considering all possible adsorption configurations, we identified six 5- HMF/catalyst combinations for each valence state (**Figure 2**[a–c\)](#page-3-0) and subsequently calculated the adoption energies. As shown in Figure [2d,](#page-3-0) the binding strengths follow the order NiO *>* NiOOH *>* Ni(OH)2 for 5-HMF, which bind via various adsorption patterns. According to the Sabatier theory, the relatively moderate binding affinity of NiOOH for 5-HMF is conducive to make the entire process facile.[\[12\]](#page-11-0)

Next, we simulated the HMFOR process on NiOxHy via proposed pathways via 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furancarboxylic acid (HMFCA) or 2,5-furandicarboxaldehyde (DFF) (Figure S1, Supporting Information). The slab models (A3) in Figure [2a–c](#page-3-0) were adopted as the initial configurations for subsequent pathway evolution analysis in HMFOR. The Gibbs free energy changes (Δ*G*) for the two HMFOR pathways to FDCA are presented in Figure [2e.](#page-3-0) For both pathways, only one step requires additional energy input, indicating that NiOxHy is a promising catalyst for facilitating the oxidation of 5-HMF to FDCA. Specifically, for both NiO and Ni(OH)2, the HMFOR process favors the pathway leading to DFF, with smaller Δ*G* of 1.62 and 1.33 eV, respectively. However, for NiOOH, the HMFOR process prefers an initial aldehyde oxidation to form HMFCA rather than the pathway yielding DFF. Thus, the DFT results predict that the oxidation of 5-HMF to FDCA is thermodynamically more favorable on NiOOH compared to Ni(OH)2 and NiO. Overall, these DFT simulations provide a robust understanding of how the NiOOH catalyst can facilitate adsorption and activation of the 5-HMF, thereby enhancing the HMFOR process to FDCA.

The preference of NiOOH for the pathway leading to HM-FCA suggests a distinct mechanistic route compared to NiO and Ni(OH)2, which favor the formation of DFF. This result highlights the importance of electronic structure of the catalysts in governing the reaction pathway. Furthermore, the lower Δ*G* value associated with NiOOH indicates that the oxidation of 5- HMF to FDCA is more thermodynamically favorable on this catalyst, underscoring its potential for practical applications. Understanding these distinct pathways and energy profiles provides valuable mechanistic insights that can guide the rational design of more efficient catalysts for biomass conversion. Additionally, surface reconstruction under electrochemical conditions generates the real active species, particularly for multivalent Ni and other transition metals.[\[13\]](#page-11-0) Therefore, rationally regulating such reconstruction in a targeted manner is crucial for fabricating highly active catalysts. This aspect is key for enhancing catalytic performance and ensuring the stability and activity of the catalyst over extended operational periods. Consequently, the findings emphasize the need for experimental validation and optimization of NiOOH-based catalysts, as well as exploration of other transition metal oxyhydroxides with similar properties to enhance HM-FOR efficiency. Ultimately, rational regulation of surface reconstruction in electrochemical conditions emerges as a key strategy for preparing highly active catalysts.

### **2.2. Fabrication and Characterizations of NiOxHy/Ni Foam Electrodes**

After screening HMFOR catalysts through DFT calculations, the next step involved fabricating and characterizing Ni-based catalysts in different valence states. This allowed for experimental validation of the computational predictions and further refinement of the catalyst design. To fabricate and characterize NiOxHy/Ni foam electrodes, a simple and cost-effective acidinduced method was employed, facilitating the conversion of inert Ni foams into highly efficient NiOxHy/Ni electrodes via surface reconstruction and chemical oxidation. The process began with the immersion of Ni foams in a 1.0 m H2SO4 solution for 3 h (Figures S2–S4, Supporting Information). Following the acid treatment, the electrodes were dried at a controlled temperature of 60 °C (**Figure 3**[a\)](#page-4-0). This treatment notably altered the surface morphology of the Ni foam. Initial observations via scanning electron microscope (SEM, Figure S5, Supporting Information) revealed a distinct roughening of the previously smooth surface. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Figure [3b\)](#page-4-0) further confirmed these morphological changes. An increase in the oxygen content of the Ni foam was detected post-acid treatment, as shown by energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS, Figures S6 and S7, Supporting Information). To investigate potential crystallographic changes, X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) analysis was conducted (Figure S8, Supporting Information). The XRD patterns for both untreated Ni and NiOxHy/Ni samples corresponded to cubic-phase Ni (PDF#04-0850), illustrating the acid treatment did not change the crystal phase of Ni. Despite this, no discernible diffraction peaks corresponding to NiOxHy were observed for the NiOxHy/Ni sample, suggesting either an amorphous state or minimal loading of NiOxHy species. To confirm the presence of NiOxHy, high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) was used for a more detailed characterization of the acid-treated electrode. The HRTEM images (Figure [3c–e\)](#page-4-0) distinctly revealed the lattice structures associated with the Ni substrate, as well as the NiOOH and Ni(OH)2 species. Specifically, lattice fringes with dspacings of ≈0.179 and 0.203 nm were identified as the (200) and (111) planes of Ni, respectively (Figure [3c\)](#page-4-0). Additionally, lattice fringe spacings of 0.208 and 0.247 nm were consistent with the (210) and (101) planes of NiOOH (Figure [3d\)](#page-4-0), while an interplanar spacing of 0.232 and 0.178 nm was observed for Ni(OH)2 (011) and (111) planes (Figure [3e\)](#page-4-0). Collectively, these findings robustly confirm the successful formation of NiOOH and Ni(OH)2 species (NiOOH/Ni(OH)2) on the surface of Ni electrode, corroborating the efficacy of the acid-induced synthesis approach.

The chemical transformations occurring on the surface of NiOOH/Ni(OH)2/Ni foam electrodes were meticulously investigated using surface-sensitive soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy

(sXAS) under total electron yield (TEY) modes. This analysis revealed profound changes in the chemical environment of the electrode surface. A pivotal observation was the shift in the Ni L3 edge for NiOOH/Ni(OH)2/Ni sample, which displayed a positive shift of ≈0.2 eV compared to the pristine Ni sample. This shift, along with an increase in the intensity of shoulder peaks (Figure S9a, Supporting Information), is indicative of an alteration in the oxidation state of Ni from Ni2<sup>+</sup> to Ni<sup>3</sup><sup>+</sup>. [\[14\]](#page-11-0) Further insights were gleaned from the analysis of the O K-edge spectra (Figure S9b, Supporting Information). A pronounced peak at ≈535 eV, attributable to the interaction between O2*<sup>p</sup>* and Ni3*<sup>d</sup>* orbitals, was significantly more pronounced in the NiOOH/Ni(OH)2/Ni sample than in pristine Ni.[\[15\]](#page-11-0) This observation underscores the partial oxidation of Ni species in the NiOOH/Ni(OH)2/Ni structure. To delve deeper into the valence state changes between the Ni and NiOOH/Ni(OH)2/Ni, high-resolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was employed. The pristine Ni displayed characteristic peaks at 852.4 and 853.8 eV, corresponding to metallic Ni and Ni2<sup>+</sup>, respectively (Figure [3f\)](#page-4-0).[\[16\]](#page-11-0) However, these peaks were conspicuously absent in the NiOOH/Ni(OH)2/Ni spectrum, leaving the signal related to Ni<sup>3</sup><sup>+</sup> at 855.9 eV.[\[17\]](#page-11-0) This finding is consistent with the oxidation of Ni<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> to Ni<sup>3</sup><sup>+</sup> following acid treatment, corroborating the sXAS results. Furthermore, an increase in signals corresponding to O 1*s* was observed in the NiOOH/Ni(OH)2/Ni sample (Figure S10, Supporting Information), reinforcing the notion of surface oxidation of the Ni foam, as suggested by the EDS results (Figures S6 and S7, Supporting Information). Specifically, the O 1*s* spectrum in Figure [3g](#page-4-0) revealed peaks at 532.1, 530.8, and 529.4 eV, corresponding to absorbed H2O (O-H2O), the hydroxyl group (O-Ni(OH)2/NiOOH), and lattice O in metal oxides (O-NiO), respectively.[\[18\]](#page-12-0) The acid treatment led to the disappearance of lattice O peak and the predominance of hydroxyl group signal. In concert with the Ni 2*p* spectra, these findings strongly suggest that NiOxHy species were in situ generated on the Ni surface via H2SO4-induced treatment strategy. This conclusion aligns seamlessly with the observations obtained from HRTEM spectra, offering a comprehensive understanding of the chemical evolution of the NiOOH/Ni(OH)2/Ni foam electrode.

#### **2.3. Electrochemical HMFOR Performance of NiOxHy/Ni Foam Electrodes**

The NiOOH/Ni(OH)2/Ni electrode, once synthesized, was integrated into an H-type electrochemical cell for the evaluation of its HMFOR efficiency in 1 m KOH electrolyte (Figures S11 and S12, Supporting Information). As shown in **Figure 4**[a,](#page-6-0) this electrode exhibited a marked superiority over pristine Ni in terms of 5-HMF conversion, FDCA yield, and Faradaic efficiency (FE). The electrooxidation kinetics of 5-HMF using the NiOOH/Ni(OH)2/Ni at varying potentials were systematically investigated, as shown in Figure [4b.](#page-6-0) Upon escalating the potential from 1.32 to 1.47 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), the FDCA yield plateaued at a potential equal to or greater than 1.37 V versus RHE. Interestingly, FE initially increased, but later declined due to 5-HMF degradation at lower potentials and the onset of competitive oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at higher potentials.[\[19\]](#page-12-0) An optimal electrolysis potential of 1.38 V versus RHE was identified for the NiOOH/Ni(OH)2/Ni electrode, balancing the energy consumption against the HMFOR performance. Under this optimized potential, the 5-HMF conversion, FDCA yield, and FE of the oxidation products as functions of passed charge on the NiOOH/Ni(OH)2/Ni electrode were further analyzed (Figure [4c\)](#page-6-0). Upon reaching a charge of 102.4 C, the electrode achieved an impressive 95.4% yield of FDCA and an FE of 99.1%, underscoring its exceptional HMFOR capability. Additionally, oxidation byproducts such as DFF, HMFCA, and 5-formylfuran-2-carboxylic acid (FFCA) were identified in the HMFOR process. Notably, DFF present in the least concentration, indicating a preferential oxidation of the aldehyde groups in 5-HMF, sequentially yielding HMFCA, FFCA, and ultimately FDCA (Figure S1, Supporting Information). This aligns with the recognized higher reaction activity of aldehydes compared to alcohols in alkaline electrolytes.[\[20\]](#page-12-0) The NiOOH/Ni(OH)2/Ni electrode retained its remarkable HMFOR performance even with increased 5-HMF concentrations (25 or 50 mm) by proportionally extending the electrolysis duration (Table S1, Supporting Information). The electrode also demonstrated exceptional longevity, maintaining consistent 5-HMF conversion, FDCA yield, and FE across 25 consecutive cycles, thus confirming its stability for HMFOR (Figure [4d;](#page-6-0) Figure S13, Supporting Information). However, a moderate performance decline was observed, with 5-HMF conversion and FDCA yield decreasing from more than 95% to less than 90% by the 25th cycle (Figure S14, Supporting Information). To investigate the underlying causes, post-cycled catalyst characterization was conducted using SEM, XRD, and XPS (Figures S15–S17, Supporting Information). These analyses reveal no significant changes in the catalyst's morphology, crystalline structure, or chemical state, suggesting that structural degradation was not responsible for the decline. Instead, the performance decrease may be attributed to the accumulation of surface by-products during prolonged electrolysis, temporarily blocking active sites or altering the local reaction environment. Notably, the activity was fully restored through potentiostatic electrolysis in 1 m KOH solution (Figure S14, Supporting Information), likely due to the removal of surface adsorbates or regeneration of active sites. This highlights the robustness of the catalyst and its capacity for regeneration under optimized conditions. Significantly, when compared to other Ni-based catalysts, the NiOOH/Ni(OH)2/Ni electrode stood out for its catalytic efficacy in HMFOR (Figure [4e;](#page-6-0) Table S2, Supporting Information).

To elucidate the mechanisms underlying the augmented catalytic activity of NiOOH/Ni(OH)2/Ni electrode, the HMFOR process was examined, focusing on the 5-HMF conversion rate. Figure S18 (Supporting Information) illustrates a significant enhancement in the rate constant for NiOOH/Ni(OH)2/Ni (1.81 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>3</sup> s<sup>−</sup>1) compared to bare Ni (3.17 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>5</sup> s<sup>−</sup>1). Such a substantial increase suggests an activation effect attributed to the acid-induced treatment on Ni. In most cases, such enhancement is ascribed to an increase in both the Brunauer–Emmett– Teller (BET) surface area and the electrochemical surface area (ESCA).[\[18a\]](#page-12-0) To substantiate this hypothesis, the BET surface area and ESCA were quantitatively assessed. N2 adsorptiondesorption isotherms were utilized to determine the BET surface area, while cyclic voltammetry techniques were employed to measure the ECSA. As evidenced in Figures S19–S21 (Supporting Information), the BET surface area of NiOOH/Ni(OH)2/Ni

(406.1 cm<sup>2</sup> g<sup>−</sup>1) was ≈11 times greater than that of pristine Ni (34.8 cm<sup>2</sup> g<sup>−</sup>1). Additionally, the ECSA of NiOOH/Ni(OH)2/Ni electrode was found to be roughly triple that of unmodified Ni. These findings suggest that the NiOOH/Ni(OH)2/Ni electrode presented a substantially higher number of active sites. When the rate constants were normalized to both the BET surface area and ECSA, the NiOOH/Ni(OH)2/Ni demonstrated superior performance relative to bare Ni (Figure 4f). This result indicates that the superior activity of NiOOH/Ni(OH)2/Ni was not solely attributed to an increase in surface area but also an enhancement in intrinsic activity, which could be attributed to the in situ formation of NiOxHy on the electrode surface. Therefore, the acid-induced NiOOH/Ni(OH)2/Ni electrode exhibited a remarkable increase in both active sites and intrinsic catalytic activity, leading to great improvements in HMFOR performance, encompassing aspects of activity, selectivity, and stability, thereby outperforming the unmodified Ni electrode.

To explore the superior electrocatalytic performance of NiOOH/Ni(OH)2/Ni electrode, comprehensive electrochemical analyses were conducted. The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves and Tafel slope analysis, presented in Figure [4g,h,](#page-6-0) were instrumental in this exploration. These measurements were performed in a 1 m KOH solution under varying conditions, including with and without the presence of 10 mm 5-HMF, to simulate the OER and HMFOR. During HMFOR, the LSV curves revealed a cathodic shift in the onset potential for NiOOH/Ni(OH)2/Ni compared to bare Ni, signifying an enhanced intrinsic activity of the modified electrode. Additionally, a marked decrease in the Tafel slope for NiOOH/Ni(OH)2/Ni (50.05 mV dec−1) relative to Ni (87.64 mV dec<sup>−</sup>1) was observed. This result suggests that NiOOH/Ni(OH)2/Ni facilitated faster electron transfer rates, underpinning its superior electrocatalytic activity. In scenarios absent of 5-HMF, the primary electrochemical response was attributed to the OER, a potential competitive side reaction in HMFOR. Based on Figure [4g,](#page-6-0) OER onset is observed above 1.55 V versus RHE. The peak observed in the range of 1.35–1.55 V versus RHE is attributed to the oxidation of Ni<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> to Ni<sup>3</sup><sup>+</sup> in both electrodes.[\[5a,21\]](#page-11-0) This aligns well with the selected reaction potential, which falls precisely within the oxidation potential range of Ni2<sup>+</sup> to Ni<sup>3</sup><sup>+</sup>. Notably, for the NiOOH/Ni(OH)2/Ni electrode, an onset potential of 1.58 V versus RHE was required to achieve a current density of 25 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> for OER, whereas a lesser potential of 1.41 V versus RHE sufficed for HMFOR. This indicates that HMFOR was thermodynamically more favorable than OER on NiOOH/Ni(OH)2/Ni electrodes. The Tafel slope analysis (Figure [4h\)](#page-6-0) further corroborates this finding. The Tafel slope for NiOOH/Ni(OH)2/Ni in HMFOR was considerably lower (50.05 mV dec<sup>−</sup>1) compared to that in OER (70.13 mV dec<sup>−</sup>1). This disparity suggests that the interfacial electron transfer with 5-HMF molecule on NiOOH/Ni(OH)2/Ni electrode was more efficient than that with OH<sup>−</sup> species. Corroborating evidence is provided by EIS Nyquist plots (Figures S22 and S23, Supporting Information). The plots revealed smaller semicircle diameters in the presence of 5-HMF, indicating that HMFOR processed faster chargetransfer kinetics compared to OER. Thus, both kinetic and thermodynamic assessments firmly establish the enhanced electrochemical activity of NiOOH/Ni(OH)2/Ni over bare Ni. Moreover, these analyses demonstrate that HMFOR was a more favorable reaction on NiOOH/Ni(OH)2/Ni compared to the competitive OER.

#### **2.4. Mechanism Explorations**

In situ electrochemical Raman was used to gain comprehensive understanding of the HMFOR mechanism on the NiOOH/Ni(OH)2/Ni electrode. This analysis was conducted in a custom-built cell, designed to monitor the dynamic changes in the surface structure of the electrode both in the absence and presence of 5-HMF (**Figure 5**[a;](#page-8-0) Figure S24, Supporting Information). As illustrated in Figure [5b,c,](#page-8-0) The Raman spectra were systematically acquired at open circuit potential (OCP) and over a range of potentials from 1.20 to 1.70 V versus RHE in increments of 0.05 V versus RHE. Notably, a data point at 1.38 V versus RHE was included due to its significance as the working potential in this work. In the absence of 5-HMF, under OER conditions (Figure [5b\)](#page-8-0), characteristic Raman peaks at 473 and 557 cm<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> emerged at an applied potential of 1.35 V versus RHE. These peaks, absent in the spectra of 5-HMF and its oxidation products (Figure S25, Supporting Information), were attributed to the bending and stretching vibrations of NiIII-O, representing typical Raman signatures of NiOOH.[\[22\]](#page-12-0) As the potential was increased to between 1.35 and 1.40 V versus RHE, an intensification of these peaks was observed, indicative of an increased generation of NiOOH species. Beyond 1.40 V versus RHE, the stability of these peaks suggested a plateau in NiOOH formation within this potential range.

In the presence of 5-HMF (Figure [5c\)](#page-8-0), the emergence of NiOOH peaks was delayed until a potential of 1.38 V versus RHE was reached, and their intensities remained constant with further potential increase. This consistency in peak intensity suggests that the HMFOR process consumed NiOOH species. To delve deeper, NiOOH/Ni(OH)2/Ni electrodes were operated at 1.38 V versus RHE for 300 s, followed by a period at OCP for 1800 s. In the absence of 5-HMF, NiOOH-associated peaks appeared during electrolysis at 1.38 V versus RHE with negligible changes in intensity in the subsequent OCP phases (Figure [5d\)](#page-8-0). However, with 5-HMF present, the characteristic NiOOH peaks observed during the initial 300 s of electrolysis rapidly diminished once the applied potential was discontinued (Figure [5e\)](#page-8-0). These findings confirm that NiOOH acted as the active species directly catalyzing HMFOR and the HMFOR proceeded via an indirect oxidation pathway with NiOOH serving as the chemical oxidant. The indirect oxidation mechanism was further corroborated by LSV curves (Figure [4g\)](#page-6-0), where an intensification of the oxidation peak of Ni2<sup>+</sup> to Ni<sup>3</sup><sup>+</sup> was observed in the presence of 5-HMF. Specifically, during the forward scan process, NiOOH was reduced to Ni(OH)2 while concurrently oxidizing 5-HMF. This process led to an increased charge consumption for the oxidation of Ni<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> to Ni<sup>3</sup><sup>+</sup>, resulting in an enhanced peak for Ni<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup>/Ni<sup>3</sup><sup>+</sup> transition.[\[23\]](#page-12-0) Furthermore, the clear detection of NiOOH Raman peaks at the working potential of 1.38 V versus RHE suggests that the regeneration rate of NiOOH surpassed the oxidation rate of 5-HMF. This finding implies that the chemical oxidation of 5-HMF by NiOOH constituted the rate-limiting step in the reaction.

Further investigation demonstrates that NiOOH formation is highly sensitive to pH. Under strongly acidic conditions (e.g., 0.1 m H2SO4), NiOOH formation was suppressed, as confirmed by the absence of Raman peaks even at high potentials (Figure S26a, Supporting Information). In near-neutral conditions (0.5 m K2SO4 in Figure S26b, Supporting Information), NiOOH formation was observed at 2.3 V versus RHE, suggesting that slightly less acidic environments provide a more favorable chemical environment for the Ni<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> to Ni<sup>3</sup><sup>+</sup> transition. In contrast, mildly alkaline conditions (e.g., 0.01 m KOH) significantly facilitated NiOOH formation, with Raman peaks appearing at lower potentials (≈1.40 V versus RHE, Figure S26c, Supporting Information), consistent with enhanced deprotonation of Ni(OH)2. Strongly alkaline conditions (e.g., 1 m KOH) further reduced the energy barrier for the Ni<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> to Ni<sup>3</sup><sup>+</sup> transition, promoting rapid regeneration of NiOOH (Figure S26d, Supporting Information). These findings corroborate literature reports that higher pH accelerates proton abstraction, enhancing the formation of active NiOOH species.

To elucidate the electrocatalytic HMFOR reaction mechanism on NiOOH/Ni(OH)2/Ni electrode, DFT calculations were employed. The computational results encompass Gibbs free energy profiles and the optimized structures of intermediates for both direct and indirect oxidation pathways of HMFOR on a NiOOH surface (Figure [5f,g;](#page-8-0) Figure S27, Supporting Information). The principal distinction between these pathways was the modality of proton abstraction from 5-HMF. In the direct pathway, surface-adsorbed hydroxide ions (OH<sup>−</sup>) extracted the H atom from 5-HMF, yielding H2O and the relevant intermediates.[\[24\]](#page-12-0) Conversely, in the indirect pathway, the NiOOH moiety itself abstracted the H atom, transforming into a Ni(OH)2 species.[\[21b\]](#page-12-0) A critical observation from Figure [5g](#page-8-0) is that the indirect oxidation pathway necessitated a nominal energy input of 0.01 eV only during the dehydrogenation of 5-HMF to HMFCA, which was greatly lower than the substantial 1.98 eV required for OH<sup>−</sup> adsorption in the direct pathway. This disparity suggests a greater likelihood for 5-HMF electrooxidation on NiOOH to follow the indirect route. Additionally, the positive Gibbs free energy change (Δ*G*) of 0.01 eV for the oxidation step from HMFCA to FFCA indicates this step as potentially rate-limiting one. The experimental observations identified the overall rate-limiting process as the chemical oxidation by NiOOH, whereas the theoretical results pinpointed the HMFCA to FFCA oxidation as a potential elementary bottleneck. Together, these findings suggest a consistent reaction mechanism in which the NiOOH-mediated indirect oxidation pathway dominates. This process encompassed two simultaneous reactions (Figure S28, Supporting Information). Initially, the adsorbed 5-HMF molecule was oxidized to its intermediates via dehydrogenation. Concurrently, NiOOH was reduced to Ni(OH)2 via the acceptance of a hydrogen atom from the 5-HMF molecule. In the subsequent phase, Ni(OH)2 underwent reoxidation under the applied anodic potential, regenerating NiOOH. Thus, 5-HMF was gradually oxidized to FDCA via these interrelated processes. The theoretical insights thus provide a molecular-level explanation for the experimental results, emphasizing the importance of combining experimental and theoretical methodologies to achieve a comprehensive understanding of catalytic mechanisms.

#### **2.5. Universality and Utility of the Approach**

To rigorously assess the viability of the acid-induced surface reconstruction strategy, we first investigated the impacts of various acid on Ni foams. This experiment extended beyond H2SO4 to include HCl treatments. A 3-h exposure of Ni foam to HCl (HA3), resulting in NiOxHy/Ni-HA3, notably enhanced the roughness of the surface (Figures S29–S31, Supporting Information). The NiOxHy/Ni-HA3 electrode demonstrated remarkable 5-HMF electrooxidation performance: achieving 99.4% 5-HMF conversion, 95.9% FDCA yield, and 96.6% Faradaic efficiency (**Figure 6**[a,b\)](#page-10-0). These findings align well with the electrochemical results, indicating that NiOxHy/Ni-HA3 exhibited a reduced onset potential, increased active site availability, and enhanced electron transfer rates compared to unmodified Ni foam (Figure S32, Supporting Information). The transformative effect of acid treatment was not limited to H2SO4 and HCl; other acids such as phosphorous acid, acetic acid, and nitric acid also generated highly efficient active NiOxHy substances and greatly improved the catalytic performance (Figure S33, Supporting Information, and Figure [6c\)](#page-10-0).

Also, this strategy proved effective on a variety of commercial metal and alloy foams, including Fe, Cu, FeNi, and NiMo foams. Post-acid treatment, these materials demonstrated a remarkable increase in FDCA yield and Faradaic efficiency, outperforming their untreated counterparts by factors ranging from 1.1 to 16 (Figure [6d;](#page-10-0) Table S3, Supporting Information). XRD analysis (Figure S34, Supporting Information) confirmed the formation of metal oxide phases on these foams as a result of acid treatment, aligning with EDS findings (Figures S35–S39, Supporting Information). SEM images (Figure S40, Supporting Information) further validated an increase in surface roughness following acid treatment, which is advantageous for exposing more catalytically active sites. Additionally, we recognize that the acidinduced reconstruction mechanism generates different metal oxides depending on the specific foam or alloy, which may lead to distinct catalytic pathways. For instance, Cu-based catalysts typically exhibit direct oxidation pathways, while Ni-based materials predominantly follow an indirect oxidation mechanism.[\[21b,24\]](#page-12-0) These variations stem from the unique electronic structures and surface properties of each metal system, as reported in recent studies.[\[4c,25\]](#page-11-0) The findings for Ni-based catalysts provide a foundation for exploring acid-induced surface reconstruction as a general strategy to optimize other metal or alloy systems for catalytic applications.

Moreover, the versatility of the NiOOH/Ni(OH)2/Ni electrode was evaluated through LSV for the electrooxidation of various organic substrates. The selected alcohols and aldehydes, structurally similar to 5-HMF, exhibited enhanced current responses (Figure S41, Supporting Information), demonstrating the electrode's broad applicability to biomass-derived platform molecules and its potential for biomass valorization.

Overall, this acid-induced surface modification technique emerged as a practical and efficient approach for enhancing biomass electrooxidation. It achieved this via a dual mechanism of surface reconstruction and chemical oxidation, applicable across a range of acid and metal foams, thereby offering a promising route for advancing the field of electrocatalysis in biomass conversion. By enabling the efficient conversion of a biomass-derived platform chemical like 5-HMF into a valuable, bio-based alternative like FDCA, this work contributes greatly to the development of sustainable chemical processes. Such processes are vital for reducing our reliance on fossil fuels and addressing the challenges of climate change. This method operates under mild reaction conditions (room temperature and atmospheric pressure) and employs a reusable acid solution to minimize material consumption and waste generation. After repeated use, the acid can be neutralized or recycled using established methods, further reducing its environmental impact.

Moreover, this acid-induced surface reconstruction strategy offers significant potential for integration into existing industrial processes while closely aligning with the principles of advanced materials design, emphasizing functionality, scalability, and sustainability. Its straightforward and scalable nature, coupled with the ability to operate under mild conditions using commercially available metal foam, ensures compatibility with standard electrode fabrication workflows. The structural robustness and

(HA3: immersing in hydrochloric acid solution for 3 h; PA3: immersing in phosphoric acid solution for 3 h; AA3: immersing in acetic acid solution for 3 h; NA1/6: immersing in nitric acid solution for 10 min.).

durability of the resulting electrodes make them particularly wellsuited for industrial reactors operating under dynamic conditions. Notably, these electrodes demonstrate tolerance to impurities commonly found in biomass feedstocks, as evidenced by their stable performance (Figure S42, Supporting Information). This resilience underscores their practical applicability in realworld scenarios. Beyond electrocatalysis, this approach holds potential for applications in energy storage and sensing, where advanced materials with tailored surface properties and redox functionality are critical. Future efforts will focus on optimizing continuous flow systems and assessing long-term electrode regeneration to further support the implementation of this method in industrial biomass conversion processes. By bridging green chemistry principles with advanced materials design, this strategy offers a scalable and sustainable pathway for industrial catalysis.

## **3. Conclusion**

In this work, we developed a cost-effective and straightforward method to transform commercially available Ni foam electrodes into highly active NiOOH/Ni(OH)2/Ni foam catalysts. This transformation is pivotal for the selective electrooxidation of 5-HMF to FDCA. The surface reconstruction and chemical oxidation induced by H2SO4 treatment are instrumental in unveiling numerous NiOOH active sites, consequently reducing the onset potential required for HMFOR. Furthermore, the coexistence of multivalent states within the metal foams, achieved via this process, enhances the catalytic activity and stability of the electrodes. Moreover, outstanding 5-HMF conversion efficiency and high FDCA selectivity are achieved at a modest applied potential in an alkaline environment. Notably, the NiOOH/Ni(OH)2/Ni foam electrode demonstrates remarkable cycling durability, underscoring its potential for practical applications. In situ Raman spectroscopy and DFT studies reveal that the oxidation of 5-HMF predominantly follows an indirect pathway, mediated by the interconversion between Ni(OH)2 and NiOOH. The versatility and effectiveness of this acid-induced surface reconstruction technique extend beyond sulfuric acid and nickel foam. It is applicable to other acids and a variety of metal foams, markedly enhancing their catalytic activities for 5-HMF electrooxidation. This adaptability significantly broadens the scope of potential applications, offering a versatile tool for enhancing various foam-based catalysts. The work provides a new avenue for the design and

The growing demand for sustainable alternatives to fossilderived chemicals has spurred significant interest in biomass valorization, with 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) emerging as a key platform molecule. In this study, an electrochemical synthesis strategy was employed to synthesize a bimetallic Codoped Cu mesh catalyst for the HMF oxidation reaction. It exhibited remarkable electrooxidation activity during a 3-h reaction at 1.6 V versus RHE with 83.2% HMF conversion, 99.4% 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) selectivity, and 87.7% Fara-

day efficiency. X-ray diffraction, in situ surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed that the modified Cu mesh catalyst introduced more Co3O4 species. Additionally, in situ attenuated total reflection surfaceenhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy elucidated that Cu species on the Co-doped Cu mesh can adsorb \*OH and couple with organic molecules during the reaction process. Cu─Co dual active sites enhance the selective electrochemical oxidation of HMF toward FDCA.

# **1. Introduction**

Over the past century, the traditional fossil fuel industry has driven rapid social and economic development, but they have also significantly contributed to greenhouse gas emissions, posing threats to human health and natural ecosystems. The growing demand for sustainable alternatives to fossil-derived chemicals has driven significant interest in biomass valorization, with 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) emerging as a pivotal platform molecule. Electrochemical oxidation of HMF to high-value products such as 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA), a renewable substitute for petroleum-based terephthalic acid in polymer production, represents a promising route to bridge sustainable energy storage and green chemical synthesis. It can be realized under ambient conditions without the need for solvents and oxidizing agents[\[1\]](#page-6-0) Electrochemical systems are modular and scalable, offering significant flexibility. Furthermore, in terms of water electrolysis for H2 production, replacing the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with the thermodynamically favorable HMF oxidation reaction (HMFOR) offers a promising strategy to reduce energy consumption, simultaneously produce H2 and generate high-value chemicals.

Nanostructured electrodes with non-precious metals, such as Mn, Co, and Cu, can achieve near-complete conversion with high efficiency.[\[2,3\]](#page-6-0) Copper-based catalysts are renowned for their cost-effectiveness. Studies indicate that copper-containing compounds exhibit low efficiency in the OER compared to Ni/Cobased catalysts, which is the primary competing reaction during the electrochemical oxidation of HMF in aqueous solutions.[\[4,5\]](#page-6-0) This suggests copper-based catalysts may offer higher selectivity for HMF oxidation. Currently, several Cu-based materials have shown remarkable activity in the HMFOR process. Lie[\[6\]](#page-6-0) et al. reported Co, Ni, and Cu-based Prussian blue analogue electrocatalysts. The results show the Cu-phase outperforms both the Co-phase and Ni-phase, demonstrating strong adsorption of \*OH species, which enhanced the selectivity toward FDCA. Zhu[\[7\]](#page-6-0) et al. prepared graphene-encapsulated CoCu nanoparticles on the hierarchical porous carbon framework, revealing the synergistic promotion of HMFOR by surface Co and neighboring Cu within the sub-nanometer lattice. Nevertheless, these reported catalyst preparation methods are cumbersome, timeconsuming, and potentially hazardous. Electrochemical synthesis enables the efficient fabrication of high-performance catalytic materials by capitalizing on the inherent electrical conductivity of metallic substrates while allowing precise structural control during material design.

In this study, we synthesized a Cu mesh (CM) catalyst using a modified cyclic chronopotentiometry method. The Co-doped CM catalyst synthesized in Co(NO3)2 electrolyte exhibited obvious HMFOR performance, with a lower onset potential and a higher FDCA selectivity than the non-doped CM. X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were performed to reveal the structure of the CuCo catalyst. In situ attenuated total reflection surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR-SEIRAS) and surface-enhanced Raman spec-

troscopy (SERS) further elucidated the synergistic promotion mechanism of Cu and Co species in the CM catalyst.

# **2. Experimental Details**

## **2.1. Chemicals and Materials**

The pieces of customized 6 × 6 cm CM (200 mesh, 0.05 mm wire diameter, 99.99% purity) were purchased from Anping County Chulin Metal Mesh Co., Ltd. Cobalt (II) nitrate hexahydrate (Co(NO3)2·3H2O, 99.99%), potassium hydroxide (KOH, 99.99%), and HMF (>95.0%) were purchased from Shanghai Aladdin Biochemical Technology Co., Ltd. Copper (II) nitrate trihydrate (Cu(NO3)2·3H2O, 98%) was purchased from Sinopharm Inc. Methanol (CH3OH, 99.90%) was purchased from Shanghai Titan Scientific Co., Ltd. Ethanol (C2H5OH, AR) was purchased from Shanghai Wohua Chemical Co., Ltd. All chemicals were used as received without further purification, and deionized water (Millipore, 18.2 Mcm) used for all processes.

#### **2.2. Preparation of Cu Mesh Catalysts**

CM pieces were first cleaned by sonication in deionized water and ethanol for 5 min, respectively. Then, two pieces were electrochemically treated in 0.15 M X(NO3)2 (X = Cu, Co) solution by applying current of ±200 mA (each segment for 40 s) for 400 segments on an electrochemical workstation (CORRTEST CS310X). The samples obtained were immersed in deionized water with 5 min sonication for cleaning.

#### **2.3. Electrochemical Measurements**

A three-electrode setup comprising the as-prepared sample (1 × 1 cm−<sup>2</sup> , working electrode), an Ag/AgCl electrode (reference electrode), and a Pt mesh (1 × 1 cm−<sup>2</sup> , counter electrode) was connected to an electrochemical workstation (CORRTEST CS310H) for the electrochemical characterizations. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed in the frequency range from 105 to 10−<sup>2</sup> Hz.

### **2.4. In Situ Characterization**

In situ ATR-SEIRAS was measured at PerkinElmer spectrum 100 spectrometer equipped with a mercury cadmium telluride (MCT) detector, a variable angle specular reflectance accessory (Jiaxing Puxiang Tech. Ltd.) and cell (Jiaxing Puxiang Tech. Ltd.) including a Pt counter electrode and an Ag/AgCl reference electrode. As the working electrode, the Cu mesh catalyst was in tight contact with the surface of the silica prism. Before electrochemical measurements, the electrolyte (7 mM HMF, 0.1 M KOH) was injected into the cell. A CHI1242C workstation was employed to record the electrochemical response. The spectrum was collected stepwise from open circuit potential (OCP) to 2.0 V versus RHE with a dwell time of 5 min at each potential.

Before electrochemical measurements, the electrolyte (7 mM HMF + 0.1 M KOH) was injected into the cell. An electrochemical workstation (CORRTEST CS310H) was employed to record the electrochemical response. The spectrum was collected stepwise from OCP to 1.17 V versus RHE with a dwell time of 5 min at each potential.

# **3. Results and Discussion**

## **3.1. Synthesis of the Cu Mesh Catalyst and HMF Electrooxidation Performance**

We utilized a cyclic chronopotentiometry method to modify the Cu mesh catalyst.[\[8–10\]](#page-6-0) Two pre-cleaned meshes were placed in a customized electrolytic cell containing metal nitrate electrolyte, alternatively serving as anode and cathode (Figure [1a\)](#page-2-0). At the oxidation voltage, Cu0 is first oxidized to Cu<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> on the surface of CM. Then, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at the reductive voltage increases the electrolyte pH during the cyclic preparation, thereby leading to the formation of metal hydroxides.[\[8,9\]](#page-6-0) Figure [1b,c](#page-2-0) outline the catalyst preparation process. CM substrates were electrochemically treated in Cu(NO3)2 or Co(NO3)2 electrolytes to synthesize CMCu or CMCo catalysts (denoted as CMCu or CMCo), respectively.

The HMFOR performance of the three catalysts was evaluated in a three-electrode H-cell using 7 mM HMF in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curve (Figure [2a\)](#page-3-0) reveals that CMCo requires a lower HMFOR overpotential (1.44 V vs. RHE) than CMCu (1.75 V vs. RHE) and CM (1.96 V vs RHE) at 10 mA cm−<sup>2</sup> . We further optimized the preparation parameters and reaction voltage for CMCu and CMCo (Figures S1 and [2b\)](#page-3-0). Optimal electrochemical parameters include an AC of ±200 mA, 40-s treatment per segment (400 segments in total), combined with a reaction voltage of 1.6 V versus RHE. Besides, there is a small peak in the low-voltage region, which may be due to a change in the valence state of the Co or Cu species, as we will explain further in a later section. Electrochemically active surface areas (ECSAs) were further calculated and provided in Figures S2–S5. CMCo shows a larger ECSA (15.3 cm<sup>2</sup> ) than CMCu (5.2 cm<sup>2</sup> ) and CM (2.8 cm<sup>2</sup> ). Post-reaction electrolytes were analyzed by highperformance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to quantify HMFOR products. As shown in Figure [2c,](#page-3-0) CM shows the lowest HMFOR activity at 1.6 V versus RHE, with an FDCA selectivity of 27.1% and a Faraday efficiency (FE) of only 5.2%. In comparison, the FDCA selectivity and FE of CMCu increased to 52.0% and 66.1%, respectively. CMCo outperforms CM and CMCu with an FDCA selectivity of 99.4% and an FE of 87.7%, representing 1.9-fold and 3.7-fold

increases in selectivity compared to CMCu and CM, respectively. Among the HMFOR catalysts in other articles,[\[11–14\]](#page-6-0) CMCo also shows excellent activity (more details are provided in Figure [2d](#page-3-0) and Table S1).

#### **3.2. Structure Characterization of the Cu Mesh Catalysts**

To investigate the morphology of CM, CMCu, and CMCo, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed (Figures [3a,](#page-4-0) S6, and S7a). The surface of CM shows a smooth and flat morphology. For CMCu, cuboidal morphology emerges. And CMCo exhibits a nanosheet-like deposition layer on the Cu grid. Energydispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) confirms the uniform distribution of O, Co, and Cu in both fresh and post-reaction CMCo catalysts (Figures [3b](#page-4-0) and S7b). Inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES) analysis demonstrates the elemental content of cobalt for CMCo (11.4 wt %).

XRD was employed to analyze the bulk structure of CMCo and CMCu. Figure [3c](#page-4-0) shows the XRD pattern of CMCo and CMCu, indicating the presence of Cu2O (2θ = 36.5°, 42.4°, 61.5°; JCPDS: #75–1531) in both of the two catalysts. For the CMCo catalyst, the pattern reveals peaks at 34.2°, 39.6°, and 57.3°, corresponding to CoO (JCPDS: #42–1300). The peaks at 31.2°, 36.8°, and 65.2° are assigned to Co3O4 (JCPDS: #42–1467). Raman spectroscopy was further conducted to confirm the composition of CMCo and CMCu. As shown in Figure [3d,](#page-4-0) Cu2O and CuO species are detectable on the CMCu catalyst, as evidenced by the characteristic Raman bands at 152, 224, and 421 cm−<sup>1</sup> for Cu2O[\[15\]](#page-6-0) and 323, 637 cm−<sup>1</sup> for CuO.[\[16\]](#page-6-0) In the case of CMCo, it displays Cu2O peak at 164, 410 cm−<sup>1</sup> , CuO peak at 260, 335 cm−<sup>1</sup> , and Cu(OH)2 peak16 at 498 cm−<sup>1</sup> . Besides, the CoO (458 cm−<sup>1</sup> ) and Co3O4 (524, 719 cm−<sup>1</sup> ) can be observed,[\[17\]](#page-6-0) which is in agreement with the XRD results. Notably, CuO phase is absent in the XRD pattern of CMCo. We propose that CuO is highly dispersed in an amorphous state.

(b) Comparison of HMFOR performance for CMCo at different reaction potentials in 0.1 M KOH containing 7 mM HMF. (c) Comparison of HMFOR performance for CMCo, CMCu, and CM at 1.6 V versus RHE in 0.1 M KOH containing 7 mM HMF. (d) Radar plot of HMFOR performance among other catalysts.

The surface structure of CMCu and CMCo catalysts was further investigated by XPS. As shown in Figure S8, the Cu 2p spectra of CMCu reveal weak satellite peaks assignable to Cu<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> in the pre-reaction state, while the Cu LMM Auger spectra indicate a predominantly Cu+-enriched surface. Post-reaction analyses demonstrate a marked increase in Cu<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> content, as evidenced by the increase of Cu<sup>2</sup>+/(Cu<sup>+</sup> + Cu<sup>2</sup>+) ratio (35.6% → 80.6%), confirming the oxidation of surface Cu species during the reaction. For the Co 2p spectrum for CMCo (Figure [3e\)](#page-4-0), the two main peaks at 781.5 and 796.9 eV are assigned to Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2, along with two satellite peaks at 789.2 and 803.5 eV.[\[17\]](#page-6-0) Furthermore, peaks of Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2 can be deconvoluted into Co<sup>3</sup><sup>+</sup> (781.8, 796.5 eV) and Co<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> (785.8, 799.8 eV).[\[18\]](#page-6-0) XPS semi-quantitative analysis indicates a Co3+/(Co<sup>3</sup>++Co<sup>2</sup>+) ratio of 65.5%. Notably, this ratio is increased to 82.8% after the reaction, suggesting the abundant surface Co3O4 species on CMCo catalyst. Besides, Cu LMM Auger spectrum for CMCo (Figure [3f\)](#page-4-0) reveals the peaks at 916.7 and 917.9 eV, assigned to Cu<sup>+</sup> and Cu<sup>2</sup>+, respectively. After the electrooxidation, the XPS semiquantitative analysis indicates that there are more Cu<sup>+</sup> sites (25.5% → 51.8%) on the surface of CMCo.

In previous LSV tests, we noted that CMCo would have a small peak in the low potential interval, and we attributed this to a change in the valence state of the Cu or Co elements. Therefore, in situ SERS was performed to further probe such valence changes for Cu or Co species. As shown in Figure S9, the peak at 524 cm−<sup>1</sup> attributed to Co3O4 becomes more distinct as the applied voltage from OCP to 1.17 V versus RHE, suggesting the increase of Co3<sup>+</sup> sites. We therefore presume that CMCo catalyst undergoes reconstruction by such a redox cycle (Co<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> + Cu<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> ↔ Co<sup>3</sup><sup>+</sup> + Cu+) during the reaction.

## **3.3. Mechanism of HMF Electrooxidation Over the CMCo Catalyst**

Nyquist plots of the electrocatalysts under HMFOR conditions (Figure [4a\)](#page-5-0) reveal distinct charge transfer kinetics. The charge transfer resistance (Rct) of CMCu (28 -) is significantly lower than that of the pristine CM substrate (122 -), indicating enhanced charge transfer efficiency at the electrode-electrolyte interface. This improvement is attributed to the electrochemical activation of the Cu mesh during coating with Cu(NO3)2, which likely optimizes surface conductivity and reduces energy barriers for electron transport. Doping with cobalt further reduces Rct to 22 for CMCo, demonstrating the synergistic effect of Co incorporation. The introduction of Co modulates the electronic structure of the catalyst, likely through the increased Co3<sup>+</sup> active sites and Ov concentration (as evidenced by XPS analysis), both of which enhance interfacial charge transfer and electrical conductivity. To probe the dynamic surface behavior, in situ EIS was performed for CMCu and CMCo (Figures S10 and [4b\)](#page-5-0). The high-frequency region exhibits a signal response attributed to surface reconstruction of CMCo at 1.17 V versus RHE, whereas CMCu has no similar response in this region, suggesting dynamic reorganization of Co and Cu species under opera-

tional conditions. Concurrently, the diminished phase angle in the low-frequency region for both CMCo and CMCu correlates with accelerated Faradaic processes, such as HMF adsorption and oxidation intermediates (e.g., HMFCA/FFCA) conversion.[\[19,20\]](#page-6-0) These observations align with the enhanced catalytic activity of CMCo, where optimized charge transfer and surface reactivity collectively promote HMF electrooxidation.

HMF oxidation to FDCA proceeds via two pathways. Path I involves alcohol group oxidation to form diformylfuran (DFF), while Path II begins with aldehyde group oxidation to gener-

ate 5-hydroxymethylfurfural carboxylic acid (HMFCA).[\[21\]](#page-6-0) In situ ATR-SEIRAS was performed in 7 mM HMF/0.1 M KOH to identify adsorbed reaction intermediates. As shown in Figure 4c, the adsorption of HMF substrate is detected at 1031, 1168, and 1638 cm.−1[\[22\]](#page-6-0) The peaks at 1254 and 1334 cm−<sup>1</sup> are assignable to 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FFCA) and HMFCA.[\[23,24\]](#page-6-0) The upward peak at 1211 cm−<sup>1</sup> is attributed to the formation of FDCA.[\[22\]](#page-6-0) The \*OH species from water molecules can be observed at 3000– 3500 cm.−1[\[25\]](#page-6-0) Only weak peaks of HMF and FFCA are observed on CM catalyst at about 1.8 V versus RHE. However, such an onset voltage decreases to 1.2 V versus RHE for CMCu. It also exhibits weak adsorption peaks of water, HMF substrate, and adsorbed species of HMFOR. In contrast, notable adsorptions of both water and the intermediates of HMFOR are observed on CMCo, while the voltage is increased from OCP to 1.0 V versus RHE, indicating the best performance in this reaction. Integrating these findings, we conclude that Co and Cu species in CMCo undergo dynamic reconstruction via a redox reaction (Co<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> + Cu<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> → Co<sup>3</sup><sup>+</sup> + Cu+) during HMFOR. More Co3O4 species further adsorb with HMF substrate, driving the electrochemical oxidation. Cu species, on the other hand, optimize the electronic state of Co through electronic modulation and structural distortion to enhance reactant adsorption and charge transfer efficiency. Meanwhile, Cu species on the CMCo surface can adsorb \*OH,

leading to efficient coupling with organic molecules and forming HMFCA/FFCA intermediates toward FDCA under high alkali concentration by reaction pathway II.[\[26–28\]](#page-6-0) The synergistic interplay between Cu and Co species endows the CMCo catalyst with exceptional HMFOR activity.

# **4. Conclusion**

The transition from energy-intensive OER to thermodynamically favorable HMFOR represents a pivotal strategy for sustainable energy conversion and biomass valorization. In this study, we developed a Co-doped Cu mesh catalyst via a scalable cyclic chronopotentiometry method, demonstrating exceptional efficiency in the electrooxidation of HMF to FDCA. The CMCo catalyst achieved remarkable FDCA selectivity (99.4%) and FE (87.7%) at 1.6 V versus RHE, outperforming both pristine CM and CMCu. Key mechanistic insights reveal that the synergistic interplay between Co and Cu species drives catalytic enhancement. The incorporation of Co induces a dynamic redox cycle (Co<sup>2</sup>++Cu<sup>2</sup>+→Co<sup>3</sup>++Cu+), increasing the abundance of Co3O4 on the CMCo surface. The Cu species preferentially adsorb \*OH and facilitate their coupling with HMF substrate adsorbed on Co3O4. With the promotion of dual active sites, CMCo cata-

<span id="page-6-0"></span>lyst effectively suppresses competitive water adsorption and steers the reaction toward FDCA via Pathway II (aldehyde group oxidation). In situ spectroscopic analyses (ATR-SEIRAS, SERS) and impedance studies further corroborate the catalyst's reconstructed surface under operational conditions, which optimizes charge transfer kinetics and stabilizes reactive intermediates (e.g., HMFCA/FFCA). The CMCo catalyst's scalability, cost-effectiveness (leveraging copper's low cost), and robust performance underscore its potential for industrial applications in sustainable chemical synthesis. This work not only advances the design of bimetallic electrocatalysts for biomass conversion but also highlights the broader viability of replacing OER with organic electro-oxidation to achieve energy-efficient, valueadded chemical production. Future efforts will focus on optimizing defect engineering and extending this strategy to other renewable feedstock transformations.

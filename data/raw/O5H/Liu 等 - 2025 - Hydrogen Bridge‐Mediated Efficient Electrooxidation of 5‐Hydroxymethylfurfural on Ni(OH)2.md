**Abstract:** Accelerating proton deintercalation and transfer on the catalyst surface is crucial for the electrochemical oxidation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) into the high-value 2,5-furanodicarboxylic acid (FDCA). Herein, we have constructed a Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>–PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3–</sup>/Ni<sub>3</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> heterojunction catalyst that demonstrates exceptional selectivity (97.16%), yield (94.16%), and Faraday efficiency (94.31%) in the selective oxidation of HMF toward FDCA. The incorporation of PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3–</sup> groups triggers the formation of hydrogen bridges and reconfigures the interfacial charge distribution, facilitating the activation and subsequent proton deintercalation of lattice-hydroxyl-groups to generate active Ni<sup>3+</sup>–O catalytic sites (PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3–</sup>····H–O–Ni<sup>2+</sup>  $\rightarrow$  HPO<sub>4</sub><sup>2–</sup> + Ni<sup>3+</sup>–O). Both density functional theory calculations and pH-dependent experiments emphasize the crucial function of these hydrogen bridges as proton ferries, effectively boosting the proton transfer efficiency during HMF oxidation. Theoretical studies unveil that the rate-controlling step for OH adsorption on Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>–PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3–</sup> occurs via the hydrogen bridge connecting the PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3–</sup> group with the  $\alpha$ -C atom in \*HMF-H intermediate (PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3–</sup>···H–O···COR  $\rightarrow$  PO<sub>4</sub><sup>2–</sup>–H···O–COR), significantly reducing the energy barrier for HMF oxidation. This study introduces a novel hydrogen bridge-mediated electrooxidation mechanism that holds great potential for advancing biomass conversion technologies.

Additional supporting information can be found online in the Supporting Information section biomass-based molecules, 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) has been distinguished by the US Department of Energy as one of the 12 most valuable chemicals derived from biomass. Typically, the electrocatalytic oxidation of biomass-derived 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) emerges as a green and efficient route toward the production of FDCA. Tompared to the thermocatalytic reactions, the electrooxidation of HMF utilizes electric energy as the primary driving force, thereby offering advantages such as mild reaction conditions, low energy consumption, and superior safety. To accelerate and optimize the HMF electrooxidation process, the design and synthesis of highly efficient catalysts are of crucial significance.

In recent years, a myriad of transition metal-based electrocatalysts have been investigated for the oxidation of HMF.[12-14] Among them, Ni-based catalysts are extensively explored due to the natural abundance, cost-effectiveness, and exceptional selectivity toward FDCA production.<sup>[15]</sup> In the electrochemical application process of Ni-based catalysts, the emergence of Ni<sup>3+</sup>OOH species on the catalyst surface serves as the genuine active sites for HMF oxidation.[16,17] The widely adopted "electrochemical-chemical" oxidation mechanism offers a potential perspective to analyze the HMF oxidation process on Ni<sup>3+</sup>OOH species, [18,19] which encompasses two pivotal steps: i) Electrochemical step-proton deintercalation of Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>: the lattice-hydroxyl-group of Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> loses a proton at the anode potential, and is oxidized to Ni<sup>3+</sup>OOH (Ni<sup>2+</sup>-O-H - H<sup>+</sup>  $\rightarrow$  Ni<sup>3+</sup>-O). ii) Chemical step—spontaneous dehydrogenation of HMF: the Ni<sup>3+</sup>-O site acting as a chemical oxidizer obtains a hydrogen atom from

 $\alpha$ -C in HMF and is reduced to Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>, meanwhile the hydroxyl or aldehyde group in HMF is oxidized to carboxylic group (Ni<sup>3+</sup>—O + HMF  $\rightarrow$  Ni<sup>2+</sup>—O—H + FDCA). As evident from this reaction mechanism, proton deintercalation and transfer are crucial factors in the electrooxidation of HMF.<sup>[20]</sup> Consequently, delving into the proton evolution process on the catalyst surface holds significant potential for advancing HMF oxidation research.

Previous researches on Ni-based catalysts have predominantly concentrated on regulating the proton deintercalation process in Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>, aiming to yield abundant Ni<sup>3+</sup>OOH active species.<sup>[21–23]</sup> In the domain of proton transfer studies, noteworthy achievements include the discovery that PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3–</sup> groups<sup>[24,25]</sup> and benzoic acid ligands<sup>[26]</sup> significantly enhance proton transfer efficiency during HMF oxidation. Nevertheless, there remains a dearth of studies delving into the intricate dynamics of proton transfer. Moreover, previous studies have focused on the independent exploration of proton deintercalation or the independent analysis of surface proton transfer. The absence of comprehensive studies that integrate both proton deintercalation and transfer has impeded the indepth understanding of the proton evolution mechanisms in the HMF oxidation process.

Herein, we have fabricated a Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>-PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup>/Ni<sub>3</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> heterojunction catalyst for efficient HMF oxidation. Due to the relatively loose and less-ordered structure caused by the bulky PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> polyhedrons, the Ni<sub>3</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> pre-catalyst undergoes surface reconstruction during electrochemical activation, resulting in the construction of Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>-PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup>/Ni<sub>3</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> heterojunction. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the hydrogen bridges and interface charge reconstruction induced by PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> groups facilitate the proton deintercalation of lattice-hydroxyl groups, effectively promoting the formation of Ni<sup>3+</sup>OOH catalytic sites. Additionally, these hydrogen bridges can serve as valid proton ferries, significantly enhancing the proton transfer efficiency. The resultant combined effect of accelerated proton deintercalation and transfer leads to a notable improvement in the HMF oxidation reaction (HMFOR) performance. Consequently, the as-synthesized catalyst exhibits an impressive oxidation current density of 118.00 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> at 1.5 V, representing a 6.7fold improvement over Ni(OH)2. Furthermore, the catalyst achieves remarkable FDCA yield and Faraday efficiency, along with excellent durability.

#### **Results and Discussion**

Theoretical calculations were primarily utilized to investigate the electron configuration and proton deintercalation process on Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>–PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup>. The structural model of Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> integrated with a PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> group on the (001) crystal plane was established and depicted in Figure 1a. The hydrogen atom in Ni<sup>2+</sup>–O–H configuration is observed to form a hydrogen bridge with the adjacent PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> group, which is susceptible to be activated due to the electronic interaction between the two moieties. The differential charge density analysis in Figure 1b,c shows that the PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> group acquires 2.177e from the Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> substrate, accompanied by a 1.30e

depletion from the proximal Ni<sup>2+</sup>-O bond. This phenomenon underscores the PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> group containing robust electronwithdrawing capability, leading to a reconstructed interfacial charge distribution and the emergence of electron-deficient Ni<sup>2+</sup>-O bond. Such electron-deficient Ni<sup>2+</sup>-O bond manifests a diminished affinity for hydrogen atoms, profitable for the proton deintercalation of Ni<sup>2+</sup>-O-H. Thus, the formed hydrogen bridge and electron-withdrawing capability of PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> lead to the O-H bond length in Ni<sup>2+</sup>-O-H increases from 0.97 to 1.03 Å (Figure 1d), revealing a weakened bond strength. The subsequent analysis of dehydrogenation energy changes in Figure 1e confirms that Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>-PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> exhibits a notably lower energy change of 3.92 eV than that of Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> (4.48 eV), which is advantageous for the formation of Ni<sup>3+</sup>OOH species. Figure 1f illustrates the proton deintercalation process occurring on Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>-PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup>. Notably, the formed hydrogen bridges participate in the proton deintercalation process, facilitating the activation and subsequent bond breaking of lattice-hydroxyl-groups, ultimately leading to the generation of Ni<sup>3+</sup>OOH active species  $(PO_4^{3-} - H - O - Ni^{2+} \rightarrow HPO_4^{2-} + Ni^{3+} - O)$ . Moreover, it has been observed that the formed hydrogen bridges function as proton ferries, accelerating the proton transfer rate (HPO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>  $\rightarrow PO_4^{3-} \cdots H^+ \rightarrow PO_4^{3-} + H^+$ ). Thus, DFT calculations underscore the pivotal role of PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> groups in facilitating proton deintercalation and transfer, ultimately enhancing the HMFOR performance.

Motivated by the theoretical calculations, we created the Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>-PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> catalyst through a corrosion-activation strategy, as illustrated in Figure 2a. Initially, the Ni<sub>3</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> pre-catalyst was synthesized through the corrosion process of NF in NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> solution. SEM images in Figure S1 show that the Ni<sub>3</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> pre-catalyst is densely covered with nanospheres with the average size of approximately 300 nm, different from the morphologies of NF and Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> catalysts (Figures S2 and S3). TEM image in Figure 2b further reveals that the grown layers of Ni<sub>3</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> consist of interconnected nanospheres. High-resolution TEM images in Figure \$4 depict an amorphous structure within the nanospheres, characterized by the absence of distinct lattice fringes. EDS elemental mapping images validate the presence and uniform distribution of Ni, O, and P within the Ni<sub>3</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> pre-catalyst (Figure 2c). XRD patterns in Figure S5 indicate that the as-prepared Ni<sub>3</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> and Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> samples exhibit identical peaks aligned with metal Ni, presumably due to the low crystallinity of grown layers. A distinct vibration peak associated with the P-O bond is observable at 1002 cm<sup>-1</sup> in the infrared spectra (Figure S6), offering convincing evidence for the existence of PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> groups on the surface of Ni<sub>3</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>. Furthermore, the XPS spectra in Figures S7 and S8 prove the presence of Ni, O, and P elements in Ni<sub>3</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> pre-catalyst. The P 2p spectrum in Figure S8c reveals a peak of PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> located at 133.5 eV, confirming the formation of Ni<sub>3</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> compound.[27] These findings indicate that the grown layers on Ni<sub>3</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> pre-catalyst are composed of interconnected amorphous Ni<sub>3</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles. In contrast to Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>, which possesses a dense and highly ordered structure consisting of [NiO<sub>6</sub>] octahedrons (Figure S9), Ni<sub>3</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> exhibits a more loose and less ordered framework due to the

incorporation of bulky phosphate anions<sup>[28]</sup> (Figure 2d). Such special structural configuration allows  $OH^-$  ions in the electrolyte to easily penetrate the lattices, thereby facilitating the surface reconfiguration of the  $Ni_3(PO_4)_2$  pre-catalyst.

Subsequently, an electrochemical activation treatment (30-cycle CV test) was employed to transform the Ni<sub>3</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> pre-catalyst into the Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>-PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> electrode. As depicted in Figure \$10, the oxidation peaks observed around 1.42 V correspond to the conversion of Ni<sup>2+</sup> to Ni<sup>3+</sup> species. The current density of the oxidation peaks for both Ni(OH)2 and Ni<sub>3</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> exhibits an initial gradual increase followed by a stabilizing trend (Figure S11). Notably, Ni<sub>3</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> displays more significant changes in the oxidation peak current density compared to Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>, indicating a more intense surface activation and reconstruction process occurring on Ni<sub>3</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>. By comparing the the OER and HMFOR performance of Ni<sub>3</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> before and after activation, it is found that the activation treatment promoted the surface reconstruction of Ni<sub>3</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, thereby enhancing its electrooxidation performance (Figure S12). SEM and TEM images in Figure S13 reveal that the activated Ni<sub>3</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> catalyst retains the nanospheres morphology. The high-resolution TEM image in Figure 2e demonstrates the presence of a thin layer

with distinct lattice fringes formed on the nanospheres. These lattice fringes, with spacings of 0.220, 0.238, 0.247, and 0.262 nm, correspond to the (103), (200), (111), and (110) crystal faces of  $\alpha$ -Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>, respectively. The  $\alpha$ -Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> phase is also confirmed by the TEM images in Figure S14. The element mapping images in Figure S15 display a uniform dispersion of Ni, O, and P atoms across the nanospheres.

Furthermore, XPS depth profile analysis was applied to explore the elemental composition and valence state changes on the Ni<sub>3</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> surface before and after the activation treatment. As illustrated in Figure 2f, both the Ni 2p<sub>1/2</sub> and Ni 2p<sub>3/2</sub> peaks shift toward the higher binding energy direction after activation. The O 1s XPS spectra exhibit a positively shifted P-O-P/P-O-M peak and a newly occurred peak belonging to the lattice  $O^{2-}$  species (Figure 2g), which further substantiates the formation of Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> phases. Notably, the XPS peaks associated with PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> groups can still be detected on the catalyst surface after activation (Figure 2h), suggesting the presence of a Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> structure anchored with PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> groups. The activated Ni<sub>3</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> sample displays a progressive variation in the characteristic peaks from the surface toward the interior, indicative of a gradient alteration in surface reconstruction. These findings confirm the

formation of Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>–PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3–</sup> layers on the amorphous Ni<sub>3</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles, revealing a unique structure composed of Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>–PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3–</sup>/Ni<sub>3</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> heterojunctions (abbreviated as Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>–PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3–</sup>). Therefore, the Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>–PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3–</sup> catalyst is successfully synthesized through the electrochemical activation of the Ni<sub>3</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> pre-catalyst.

Electrochemical performances of HMF oxidation was performed through a three-electrode system in an H-type electrolytic cell. LSV curves in Figure 3a show that the Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>–PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup>, Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>, and NF catalysts all have an oxidation peak after about 1.35 V, which is attributed to the oxidation of Ni<sup>2+</sup> into Ni<sup>3+</sup> species. The prominent oxidation peak proves that Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>–PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> contains more excellent HMFOR activity than NF and Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>. As shown in Figure 3b, Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>–PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> exhibits a onset potential of 1.35 V, which is lower than those of Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> (1.37 V) and

NF (1.39 V). It indicates that the Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>-PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> achieves a significantly lower energy barrier for proton deintercalation, which aligns well with the afore-mentioned DFT calculations. Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>-PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> also obtains a current density of 118.00 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> at 1.5 V, significantly larger than those of Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> and NF (17.50 and 9.09 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>). Besides, the HMFOR and OER properties for  $Ni(OH)_2$ - $PO_4^{3-}$  have been compared in Figure S16. The large increasement of current density from  $16.26 \text{ mA cm}^{-2}$  (OER) to  $118.00 \text{ mA cm}^{-2}$  (HMFOR) at 1.5 V confirms that Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>-PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> is favorable to react with HMF and validly restrict the completing OER. For evaluating the electrocatalytic kinetics, the Tafel slopes are calculated through fitting the relevant polarization curves. As depicted in Figure 3c, Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>-PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> has a Tafel slope of 34.70 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>, which is lower than those of Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>  $(93.77 \text{ mV dec}^{-1})$  and NF  $(190.48 \text{ mV dec}^{-1})$ , indicating a 15213757, 2025, 42, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ange.202509274 by University Of Science, Wiley Online Library on [0501/2026].

more efficient electrocatalytic kinetics.  $Ni(OH)_2$ – $PO_4^{3-}$  also displays a semicircle with the smallest diameter in the Nyquist plots (Figure S17), suggesting a much faster charge transfer capability. The  $C_{dl}$  values of  $Ni(OH)_2$  and  $Ni_3(PO_4)_2$  before and after activation were estimated by recording CV curves at various scan rates (Figures S18 and S19). After activation, both catalysts exhibited an increase in their  $C_{dl}$  values. Specifically, the increase for  $Ni_3(PO_4)_2$  was 4.22 times, which

is greater than the 1.34-fold increase observed for  $Ni(OH)_2$ . This indicates that significant surface reconstruction occurred on the surface of  $Ni_3(PO_4)_2$ . The ECSA values for  $Ni(OH)_2$  and  $Ni_3(PO_4)_2$  after activation were calculated to be 110.75 and 92.00, respectively. The LSV curves for HMF oxidation were normalized by ECSA. As depicted in Figure \$20, the oxidation current density of  $Ni(OH)_2$ — $PO_4^{3-}$  is higher than that of  $Ni(OH)_2$ , further confirming the prominent HMF oxidation

activity of Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>-PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup>. Moreover, the effect of concentrations of NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> reaction solutions on the HMFOR property of catalysts was explored. The Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>-PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> catalyst derived from the 100 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> solution exhibits the highest current density (Figure S21). Excessively low or high concentrations of NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> solutions are not conducive to obtaining a uniformly distributed nanosphere layer (Figure \$22), which in turn affects the electrocatalytic performance. To prove the effectiveness of NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> reaction solution for the enhanced HMFOR of Ni(OH)2-PO43- catalyst, the NF-Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub> and NF-Na<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> control samples are also synthesized from the 100 mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub> and NF-Na<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> solution, respectively. As can be seen from Figure S23, the NF-Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub> and NF-Na<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> samples after activation achieve the current density of 7.32 and 11.50 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> at 1.5 V, quite lower than that of Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>-PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> (118.00 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>). The control experiment reveals that the NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> reaction solution is responsible for the initial formation of Ni<sub>3</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> layers on NF, thus inducing the generation of highly effective Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>-PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> active phases for HMFOR. Moreover, the pH measurements suggest that the corrosion phenomenon of NF in NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> solution belongs to a pH self-adjustment process (Table S1 and Figure S24).

To investigate the electrooxidation products of HMF catalyzed by Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>-PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup>, an i-t measurement was conducted at 1.5 V in an H-type cell (depicted in Figure 3d). Given the presence of hydroxymethyl and aldehyde groups in HMF, there exist two potential reaction pathways for HMF electrooxidation, namely the HMFCA-pathway and the DFFpathway (Figure 3e).[29,30] HPLC analysis was established to provide the accurate quantification of reaction products, and the HPLC standard curves were shown in Figure \$25. The HPLC spectra of oxidation products after the passage of different charges are shown in Figure S26. When the consumed charge reaches the theoretical value of 86.7 C. the HMF reactant almost disappears and the FDCA product reaches the maximum value, suggesting that  $Ni(OH)_2$ - $PO_4^{3-}$ can efficiently promote the conversion of HMF into FDCA. The HPLC analysis reveals the presence of HMFCA and FFCA intermediates, yet no detectable traces of DFF is observed throughout the oxidation process, indicating that the electrooxidation of HMF on Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>-PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> follows the HMFCA-pathway. The i-t curves and charge-time plots in Figure \$27 show that the conversion of HMF on  $Ni(OH)_2$ - $PO_4^{3-}$  takes only 29.3 min to reach 86.7 C. Figure 3f depicts that the HMF conversation rate of 96.91% and FDCA yield of 94.16% are achieved after 86.7 C. Prominent durability is of critical importance for HMFOR catalysts. In seven consecutive cyclic tests (Figure 3g and Table S2), the HMF conversion rate, FDCA yield, selectivity and Faraday efficiency all maintain stable without obvious delay, revealing an excellent HMFOR durability. All seven cycles of HMFOR are accomplished within one hour, with the carbon balance for each individual cycle surpassing 94% (Figure \$28).

For comparison, the oxidation products catalyzed by NF and Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> electrodes were also determined. Figure S29 shows that some HMF molecules are not converted and the FDCA yield values are quite lower after the *i-t* detection of 90 min. Figure 3h shows the kinetic performances of NF,

Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>, and Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>-PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> based on the linear relationship of ln(C<sub>HMF</sub>/C<sub>0</sub>) with time.<sup>[31]</sup> The kinetic constant of  $Ni(OH)_2$ - $PO_4^{3-}$  ( $k = 0.105 \text{ min}^{-1}$ ) is significantly higher than those of NF  $(k = 0.006 \,\mathrm{min^{-1}})$  and Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>  $(k = 0.016 \,\mathrm{min^{-1}})$ , suggesting the excellent reaction kinetic. Moreover, an indepth investigation into the proton transfer dynamics on the Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>-PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> surface was conducted through a pHdependent experiment. A key observation from this analysis is that a catalyst exhibiting a smaller pH dependence typically possesses a higher proton transfer efficiency.[32,33] As illustrated in Figures 3i,j and \$30, Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>-PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> displays notably lower pH-dependent slopes of 0.73 and 0.66 than those of Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> (0.93 and 0.87) in 1 M KOH electrolyte both without and with HMF. Besides, through conducting integration analysis on the reduction peaks of Ni<sup>3+</sup>OOH species (Figures S31 and S32), the TOF data at different pH levels were calculated. As shown in Figure \$33, the TOF slope for Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>-PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> across varying pH levels is determined to be 2.46, which is significantly lower than the slope of 4.92 observed for Ni(OH)2. These observation indicate that the electrocatalytic reaction on Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>-PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> appears to be less sensitive to pH fluctuations compared to Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>. [34] The above results suggest the superior proton transfer efficiency on the Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>-PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> surface, which can be attributed to the PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> induced hydrogen bridges as proton ferries. In addition, the HMFOR property of Ni(OH)2-PO4<sup>3-</sup> exceeds most of the recently reported electrocatalysts (Figure 3k and Table \$3). Even in an electrolyte containing 100 mM HMF, the performance of Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>-PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> is comparable to that of some of the most advanced catalysts (Figure \$34 and Table S4), revealing a promising application perspective.

To evaluate the reaction pathway selectivity of Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>-PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> on HMF, LSV curves for 2-furaldehyde and furfuryl alcohol oxidation were determined, as illustrated in Figure 4a. The current density for 2-furaldehyde oxidation increases in Step I and then decreases gradually in Step II, while the current density for furfuryl alcohol oxidation keeps increasing in the two steps. Different from the 2furaldehyde oxidation, the oxidation product of furfuryl alcohol is 2-furaldehyde that can be further oxidized, leading to a continuously rising current density. Thus, the LSV curves in Step I can availably reflect the oxidation selectivity on hydroxymethyl and aldehyde groups. Notably, the current density of 2-furaldehyde oxidation increase more quickly than that of furfuryl alcohol oxidation, suggesting the preferential oxidation of aldehyde groups on Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>-PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup>. The similar phenomenon is also observed for Ni(OH)2 (Figure S35). Furthermore, the tests in Figures S36 and S37 show that Ni(OH)2-PO43- contains higher current density for 2-furaldehyde and furfuryl alcohol oxidation than those of Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>, demonstrating the prominent oxidation activity on both hydroxymethyl and aldehyde groups.

The in situ Raman spectroscopy was utilized to analyze the HMFOR active species on Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>–PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3–</sup> catalyst. As illustrated in Figure 4b, Raman spectra acquired in 1 M KOH electrolyte reveal the emergence of two distinct peaks at 471 and 550 cm<sup>-1</sup> as the voltage increases to 1.35 V. These peaks are attributed to the  $E_{\rm g}$  bending and A<sub>1g</sub> stretching vibration of Ni–O bonds in Ni<sup>3+</sup>OOH, respectively, confirming the

rapid formation of active Ni3+OOH species through the proton deintercalation of Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> phase. [35] However, the characteristic peaks of Ni<sup>3+</sup>OOH appear for the Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> sample when the potential reaches 1.45 V (Figure \$38), indicating a higher energy barrier for proton deintercalation. Upon introducing HMF into the 1 M KOH solution, a notable decrease in the peak intensity of Ni<sup>3+</sup>OOH is observed for  $Ni(OH)_2$ - $PO_4^{3-}$  (Figure 4c). This decrease is attributed to the consumption of Ni<sup>3+</sup> sites during the reaction between HMF and Ni<sup>3+</sup>OOH.<sup>[36]</sup> Consequently, the Ni<sup>3+</sup>OOH species generated on the Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>-PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> surface emerge as the genuine active sites for the HMFOR, enabling the efficient conversion of HMF to FDCA. To further validate the catalytic active sites, a multi-step potentiostatic test was executed: an i-t measurement was conducted in 1 M KOH electrolyte at a constant potential of 1.5 V, and subsequently 10 mM HMF was added to the solution, and the working potential was adjusted to the open-circuit potential (OCP) for 80 s.[37] As depicted in Figure 4d, the quite higher oxidation and reduction current density of Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>—PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> indicate that more Ni<sup>3+</sup>OOH species are formed. Upon the potential of 1.5 V is applied, a marked reduction in the oxidation currents of both Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>—PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> and Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> is observed, signifying the accumulation of Ni<sup>3+</sup> species. Notably, when HMF is introduced, the reduction current vanishes at OCP, strongly indicating that the accumulated Ni<sup>3+</sup> sites have reacted with HMF, accompanied by the spontaneous proton migration from  $\alpha$ -C of HMF to Ni<sup>3+</sup>. This observation provides compelling evidence for the occurrence of an indirect oxidation process involving high-valence Ni<sup>3+</sup> species during the reaction, further substantiating the active role of Ni<sup>3+</sup>OOH species in facilitating the efficient electrooxidation of HMF.

DFT calculations are further adopted to analyze the Gibbs free energy changes of HMF oxidation pathways on  $Ni(OH)_2$  and  $Ni(OH)_2$ — $PO_4^{3-}$  (Figures 4e, S39 and S40). Notably,

the OH adsorption after the \*HMF-H step is proposed as the rate-controlling step for HMFOR. Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>-PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> displays a quite lower energy barrier of 0.55 eV than that of Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> (1.06 eV), which is profitable for accelerating HMFOR process. To deeply investigate the rate-controlling step, the reaction models of OH adsorption after the \*HMF-H step are presented in Figure 4f.g. It is observed that the OH adsorption on Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> is carried out via the O site in Ni<sup>3+</sup>—O adjacent to the HMF adsorption site. However, the OH adsorption on Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> $-PO_4^{3-}$  is performed through the hydrogen bridge between the  $\alpha$ -C in \*HMF-H and the PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> group. The O atom of the adsorbed OH directly connects with  $\alpha$ -C in \*HMF-H, while the H atom of the adsorbed OH links to the O of PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup>. The interaction of hydrogen bridge significantly improves the adsorption and bond cleavage of OH on Ni(OH)2–PO4 $^{3-}$  (PO4 $^{3-}\cdots$ H–O···COR  $\rightarrow$  PO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>-H···O-COR), thereby promoting the deintercalation of protons from OH and accelerating the formation of \*HMFCA. Notably, the formed hydrogen bridges can also serve as proton ferries to actively participate in the HMF oxidation steps, which is advantageous for decreasing the reaction energy barrier. Consequently, the oxidation of HMF on Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>-PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> demonstrates a distinctive hydrogen bridge-mediated electrooxidation mechanism, offering profound insights into the HMF oxidation process.

Given the effectiveness of the hydrogen bridge-mediated electrooxidation, we have extended its application scope to Co foam (CoF), Cu foam (CuF) and Fe foam (FeF), synthesizing the  $Co(OH)_2-PO_4^{3-}$ ,  $Cu(OH)_2-PO_4^{3-}$  and Fe(OH)<sub>3</sub>-PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> catalysts, respectively. As evidenced in Figure S41, the distinct color changes of Co<sub>3</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, Cu<sub>3</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> and FePO<sub>4</sub> pre-catalysts before and after the corrosion reaction indicate the successful formation of phosphate coatings on the electrode surfaces. Upon undergoing electrochemical activation, the corresponding targeted  $Co(OH)_2 - PO_4^{3-}$ ,  $Cu(OH)_2 - PO_4^{3-}$  and  $Fe(OH)_3 - PO_4^{3-}$ catalysts are achieved, which reveal the largely enhanced HMFOR activity compared to their respective pristine foam substrates (Figure \$42). This observation underscores the remarkable versatility and effectiveness of the hydrogen bridge-mediated electrooxidation. Besides, the LSV curves in Figure S43 establish that Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>–PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3–</sup> surpasses all other catalysts in terms of HMFOR activity, achieving a remarkable current density of 118.00 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> at 1.5 V, much higher than those of  $Co(OH)_2$ – $PO_4^{3-}$  (66.3 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>),  $Cu(OH)_2$ – $PO_4^{3-}$  $(8.28 \text{ mA cm}^{-2})$  and  $Fe(OH)_3-PO_4^{3-}$   $(4.96 \text{ mA cm}^{-2})$ . Further comparison of LSV curves for HMFOR and OER reveals that Co(OH)<sub>2</sub>-PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> and Cu(OH)<sub>2</sub>-PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> exhibit HMFOR activity, Fe(OH)<sub>3</sub>-PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> displays poor HMFOR activity, with the indistinguishable LSV curves for HMFOR and OER (Figure \$44). A comparative assessment of the difference in current density between HMFOR and OER at 1.5 V is depicted in Figure S45. Specifically, Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>-PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> displays a large current density window of 101.74 mA cm<sup>-1</sup>, far exceeding those of Co(OH)<sub>2</sub>-PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> (49.3 mA cm<sup>-1</sup>),  $Cu(OH)_2 - PO_4^{3-}$  (7.06 mA cm<sup>-1</sup>) and  $Fe(OH)_3 - PO_4^{3-}$ (1.55 mA cm<sup>-1</sup>). This large current density window is indicative of a preferred HMFOR activity over OER, a crucial factor in achieving exceptional selectivity for FDCA production. Moreover, the Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>–PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> catalyst is synthesized at room temperature, which eliminates high-energy thermal processes and thereby streamlines scalability for industrial-scale production. A large-size Ni<sub>3</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> pre-catalyst with the size of 8  $\times$  8 cm² is successfully synthesized, and the SEM images confirm the uniformity of the interconnected nanosphere structure (Figure S46). LSV curves in Figure S47 demonstrate that the large-sized Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>–PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> electrode retains a comparable HMFOR activity to its smaller counterpart, underscoring the potential for practical applications.

#### Conclusion

efficient summary, we have synthesized an Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>-PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup>/Ni<sub>3</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> heterojunction catalyst with remarkable HMF oxidation activity through using a corrosion-activation approach. The bulky PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> polyhedrons contribute to a relatively loose and less-ordered structure, enabling the electrochemical transformation of Ni<sub>3</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> pre-catalyst into the highly active Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>-PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> nanolayers. DFT calculations and pH-dependent experiment confirm that the formed hydrogen bridges induced by PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> groups simultaneously facilitate the proton deintercalation and transfer efficiency, acting as effective proton ferries. The rate-controlling step of OH adsorption is performed through the hydrogen bridge between the  $\alpha$ -C in \*HMF-H and the PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> group, significantly reducing the reaction energy barrier. The optimized catalyst exhibits exceptional performance, achieving a high current density of 118.00 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> at 1.5 V, along with a high FDCA yield of 94.16% and Faraday efficiency of 94.31%. Both the FDCA yield and Faraday efficiency remain above 91% even after seven cycles, underscoring the remarkable durability. Furthermore, the universality of the hydrogen bridge-mediated electrooxidation has been validated through extending to other metal foams such as Co foam, Cu foam and Fe foam. This work provides a novel and valuable hydrogen bridge-mediated electrooxidation mechanism for promoting biomass conversion applications.

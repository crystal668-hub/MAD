# Metal sulfide enhanced metal—organic framework nanoarrays for electrocatalytic oxidation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural to 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid†

Yixuan Feng,<sup>a</sup> Kun Yang,<sup>a</sup> Richard L. Smith, Jr <sup>b</sup> and Xinhua Qi <sup>\*</sup>

Electrochemical oxidation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) is an efficient and sustainable way to produce a 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) monomer. In this study, two-dimensional (2D) metal-organic framework (MOF) nanoarrays embedded with Ni/Co/Fe sulfide nanoclusters were employed as electrocatalysts for HMF oxidation. The as-prepared NiCoFeS-MOF catalyst had interlaced structures and achieved 100% HMF conversion, 99% FDCA yields and Faraday efficiencies as high as 99% at 1.39 V vs. RHE driving voltage. Combination of metal sulfide nanoclusters with 2D MOF nanoarrays greatly enlarged the electrochemical active surface area and increased the number of active catalytic sites while improving electron transport. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy indicated that electronic interactions increased the electron density of metal sites and enhanced intrinsic NiCoFeS-MOF electrooxidation performance. Embedding metal sulfide nanoclusters into MOF nanoarrays using the simple one-step solvothermal method proposed in this work greatly expands the scope of electrode materials available for electrochemical upgrading of biomass-related compounds.

# 1. Introduction

The platform chemical 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) can be used for producing a wide range of value-added chemical products.<sup>1,2</sup> In particular, 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA), which can be obtained from the oxidation of HMF, is one of the critical materials used in synthesis of high-performance biobased polymers.3,4 Traditional methods for preparing FDCA from HMF are carried out via thermocatalytic reactions that typically require elevated temperatures and high pressures along with the use of high-cost noble metal (e.g., Au, Pd and Ru) catalysts.5-8 In contrast, methods for selective oxidation of HMF driven by an applied voltage under mild conditions (normal temperature and pressure) have gradually emerged as environmentally friendly alternatives.<sup>9,10</sup> Moreover, in electrocatalytic methods, the six electrons provided by HMF in the anode oxidation reaction to FDCA favor the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at the cathode, thereby enhancing the overall economic efficiency and practicality of the system. 11,12 Generally speaking, FDCA yield and Faraday efficiency (FE) at low potential are two essential criteria used in evaluating the electrooxidative efficiency of HMF.<sup>13</sup> Therefore, in pursuing electrochemical methods for producing FDCA, highly active and robust catalytic electrode materials are necessary.

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), which are highly-ordered crystalline coordination polymers, have been widely applied to the field of electrocatalysis because of their large surface area, customizable structure, and diverse distribution of metal centers. 14,15 Nevertheless, the three-dimensional (3D) structure of MOFs tends to hinder electron transfer at the catalystsubstrate interface, resulting in insufficient mass/charge transport capacity and poor electrocatalytic performance. 16,17 Moreover, hidden micropores in the MOF tend to lower mass transfer by making it difficult for the substrate in the electrolyte to reach active sites.18 Therefore, in situ growth of twodimensional (2D) MOF nanoarrays on conductive scaffolds may provide an effective strategy to address the above inherent limitations of 3D MOFs as electrodes for electrocatalytic applications.19 For example, 2D MOF nanosheets exhibit higher electrocatalytic activity due to exposure of more metal atoms with unsaturated coordination sites, and they have short mass diffusion paths and low transport resistance.20-23 Furthermore, the valence of the metal at the catalytic site favorable for oxidation can be selected via choice of appropriate organic ligands in 2D MOF nanosheets.24,25

Ni-based catalysts are considered the effective active species for the electrooxidation of HMF, and Ni-based materials such as

Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub>/Ni,<sup>12</sup> hp-Ni,<sup>26</sup> NiB<sub>x</sub>@NF,<sup>27</sup> NiCoP<sup>28</sup> and Ni<sub>x</sub>Co<sub>3-x</sub>O<sub>4</sub> alloy<sup>29</sup> have shown high FDCA yields and FE for HMF oxidation. Among them, Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub> stands out due to its high conductivity and unique spatial orientation.30,31 However, Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub> catalysts tend to have few exposed active sites and poor ion transport kinetics which are inherent limitations in electrocatalysis.32,33 Recent studies have shown that embedding metal sulfides into MOFs can produce strong electronic interactions, which effectively modulate the electronic structure of catalytically active atomic sites and improve the electronic conductivity of MOF composites.34,35 Moreover, the interface formed between the metal sulfide and MOF not only provides a continuous channel for electron transport, but also further increases the number of accessible active sites, thus promoting electrocatalytic kinetics.36

Inspired by the above studies and considering the synergistic effect of multi-component catalysts, we prepared a MOFstructured electrocatalyst (NiCoFeS-MOF) embedded with metal sulfide clusters on nickel foam by a simple one-step solvothermal method. The existence of sulfide nanoclusters promotes formation of ultrathin nanosheets in the MOF structure, increases the number of catalytically active sites, and improves the conductivity of the original catalyst, while the sulfide nanoclusters allow optimization of the intrinsic electronic structure of NiCoFeS-MOF that enhances the electrochemical oxidation performance of metal active centers. As a transition metal-based electrocatalyst, NiCoFeS-MOF exhibited excellent performance for HMF oxidation achieving 100% conversion and 99% yields for FDCA with 99% Faraday efficiency. The design strategy of combining one-step embedding of nanoclusters into MOF structure synthesis provides a new approach for improving non-noble metal-based electrocatalysts in the field of sustainable energy conversion and green chemistry transformations.

# 2. Experimental

#### 2.1 Materials

Nickel nitrate hexahydrate (Ni(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>·6H<sub>2</sub>O, 99%) and 2-formyl-5-furancarboxylic acid (FFCA) were purchased from Aladdin Ltd. Cobalt nitrate hexahydrate (Co(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>·6H<sub>2</sub>O, 99%), iron chloride hexahydrate (FeCl<sub>3</sub>·6H<sub>2</sub>O, 99%), terephthalic acid (TPA, 99%), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, 99.5%), 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF, 97%), 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA, 97%), 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furancarboxylic acid (HMFCA, 97%), 2-formyl-5-furancarboxylic acid (FFCA, 97%) and potassium hydroxide (KOH, 95%) were obtained from Macklin Ltd. Thioacetamide (TAA, 99%) was gained from Sinopharm Ltd. All reagents were used without further purification. Ultrapure water (18.2 M $\Omega$ ) was obtained from a Millipore ultra-pure water purification system for all experiments.

# 2.2 Synthesis of NiCoFeS-MOF, NiCoFe-MOF and CoFe-Ni $_3$ S $_2$

NiCoFeS-MOF nanosheet arrays were prepared on nickel foam (NF) by a one-step solvothermal method. Typically, 0.64 mmol

Ni(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>·6H<sub>2</sub>O, 0.16 mmol Co(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>·6H<sub>2</sub>O, 0.16 mol FeCl<sub>3</sub>·6H<sub>2</sub>O, 0.8 mmol TPA and 1.06 mmol TAA were ultrasonically dispersed into 20 mL DMF and 8 mL of ethanol, followed by stirring for 20 min. After this, the resultant solution was transferred into a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave with a piece of pre-cleaned NF ( $2 \times 4 \text{ cm}^2$ ) that had been sonicated sequentially with 3 M HCl, ethanol and deionized water. Then, the autoclave was heated to 150 °C and kept under that condition for 5 h. After completion of the reaction period, the autoclave was cooled to room temperature by natural convection. The reactor was opened and the resulting solid material was washed with deionized water and dried overnight at 60 °C to obtain NiCoFeS-MOF. In the above synthesis process, NiCoFe-MOF was prepared in the absence of TPA and CoFe-Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub> was synthesized in the absence of TPA.

#### 2.3 Synthesis of NiS-MOF, NiCoS-MOF and NiFeS-MOF

The synthesis procedures for NiS-MOF, NiCoS-MOF and NiFeS-MOF were the same as those used for NiFe-MS/MOF@NF except that the metal salt species and proportions were changed (0.96 mmol Ni(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>·6H<sub>2</sub>O for NiS-MOF, 0.64 mmol Ni(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>·6H<sub>2</sub>O and 0.32 mmol Co(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>·6H<sub>2</sub>O for NiCoS-MOF, 0.64 mmol Ni(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>·6H<sub>2</sub>O and 0.32 mmol FeCl<sub>3</sub>·6H<sub>2</sub>O for NiFeS-MOF).

#### 2.4 Material characterization

X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded using an Ultima IV X-ray diffractometer with Cu-K $\alpha$  radiation (Rigaku, Japan). Morphology of samples synthesized on NF was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, ZEISS GeminiSEM 300). Microstructures of ultrasonically exfoliated samples from NF were observed with field-emission transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Talos F200X G2). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was conducted on a Thermo ESCALAB Xi with Al K $\alpha$  radiation and charge correction was carried out using the binding energy of C 1s (284.8 eV) as the energy standard.

#### 2.5 Electrochemical measurements

Electrochemical performance of the materials was assessed with a CHI 660 electrochemical workstation (CH Instruments, Inc., Shanghai) using a three-electrode system at room temperature. The H-type electrolytic cell was divided into anode and cathode chambers with a Nafion 117 proton exchange membrane. The as-prepared catalytic electrode (1 cm $^2 \times$  1 cm $^2$ ), a platinum sheet (1 cm<sup>2</sup> × 1 cm<sup>2</sup>) and Ag/AgCl served as working, counter and reference electrodes, respectively. Electrochemical experiments were conducted with 10 mL 1.0 M KOH electrolyte (pH = 13.6) and 10 mL 1.0 M KOH electrolyte containing 50 mM HMF. Potentials vs. the Ag/AgCl reference electrode were converted to a reversible hydrogen electrode (vs. RHE) with the Nernst equation: E (vs. RHE) = E (vs. Ag/AgCl) +  $0.197 \text{ V} + 0.059 \times \text{pH}$ . All linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) data were recorded at a scan rate of 5 mV s<sup>-1</sup> without iR compensation. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) tests were conducted over a frequency range of 0.1 Hz to 10<sup>5</sup> Hz with 10 mV amplitude at 1.39 V vs. RHE. Double-layer capacitance

 $(C_{\rm dl})$  was evaluated using cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves recorded at scan rates of 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 mV s<sup>-1</sup> in the nonfaradaic region.

#### 2.6 Product analyses

HMF and its oxidation products were analyzed with highperformance liquid chromatography (HPLC, Thermo Fisher Scientific, U3000) equipped with a C18 column and an ultraviolet detector at 278 nm, which is the maximum absorption wavelength of HMF. The HPLC mobile phase was 5% acetonitrile and 95% acetic acid (0.1 wt%) that had a flow rate of 1 mL min<sup>-1</sup> and column oven was maintained at 30 °C. For each analysis, an aliquot of 30 µL sample was extracted from the sample solution and diluted to 1.5 mL with ultrapure water. The above sample was filtered with a strongly acidic ion exchange resin to neutralize the sample and then passed through a 0.22 μm polyethersulfone membrane prior to HPLC analysis.

Calibration curves were constructed to quantify HMF and its oxidation products. HMF conversion, FDCA yield and Faraday efficiency were calculated using the following formulae:

HMF conversion (%) = 
$$\left(1 - \frac{\text{moles of remaining HMF}}{\text{moles of initial HMF loaded}}\right)$$
  
× 100%

FDCA yield (%) = 
$$\frac{\text{moles of FDCA formed}}{\text{moles of initial HMF loaded}} \times 100\%$$

FE (%) = 
$$\frac{\text{moles of FDCA formed} \times 6 \times F}{\text{total charge passed}} \times 100\%$$
 (3)

where F is the Faraday constant (96 485 C  $\text{mol}^{-1}$ ).

#### Results and discussion 3.

Hierarchical NiCoFeS-MOF nanoarrays assembled by multiple metal ions (Co<sup>2+</sup>, Ni<sup>2+</sup> and Fe<sup>2+</sup>), TPA (organic ligands) and TAA (sulfur source) were grown in situ on nickel foam (NF) by a onestep solvothermal method (Fig. 1a). The SEM image (Fig. 1b) shows that the NF electrode was completely covered by densely grown NiCoFeS-MOF nanosheet arrays, and the surfaces of these nanosheet arrays have a hierarchical structure with dense and ultrathin layers. The nanosheets are cross-connected with each other, in which numerous ultrathin small nanosheets are attached to thicker nanosheets, forming a 3D frame with a large amount of void space (Fig. 1b, inset). This open frame structure facilitates mass transfer and provides abundant active sites for electro-oxidation of HMF.37,38 The NiS-MOF and NiFeS-MOF materials exhibit 2D nanosheet morphologies, whereas the NiCoS-MOF material has hierarchical 3D bulk structures (Fig. S1-S3†). The TEM image of NiCoFeS-MOF (Fig. 1c) reveals a hierarchical structure of the nanoarray with no noticeable cracks, indicating mechanical integrity between the components. Additionally, compared with NiCoFe-MOF (Fig. S4†), the ultrathin nanosheets observed on the surface of NiCoFeS-MOF

are found to be CoFe-Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub>, which confirms the interface structure. HRTEM analysis (Fig. 1d) exhibits well-resolved lattice fringes with interplanar distances of 0.234 nm and 0.183 nm, corresponding to the spacings of the (003) and (113) planes of Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub>, respectively.<sup>33,39</sup> SEM-EDS analyses (Fig. S5†) and TEM element mapping (Fig. 1e) of NiCoFeS-MOF reflect the presence of Ni, Co, Fe, C and S in the sample and the uniform distribution of these elements in the nanosheets, while dispersion of the S element further confirms metal sulfides in the sample.

The XRD pattern of NiCoFeS-MOF exhibits a clear diffraction peak near 8.6° (Fig. 1f) corresponding to the (200) plane of simulated 2D Ni-MOF, illustrating that the crystal structure of the MOF is isomorphic in accordance with the previously reported 2D Ni-MOF (no. 985792, space group of C2/m).<sup>25</sup> The crystal structure of 2D NiCoFe-MOF nanosheets illustrated in Fig. S6† shows that the metal ions are octahedrally coordinated with six O atoms, and the resulting 2D metal layers are linked by TPA ligands. Diffraction peaks (Fig. 1f) located at 21.8°, 31.1°, 37.8°, 49.7°, and 55.1° can be well-indexed to Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub> (ICPDS# 44-1418), suggesting the coexistence of Ni-MOF and metal sulfides in the prepared materials. Subsequently, the mechanism of metal sulfide growth in the MOF structure was explored. The S<sup>2-</sup> released by TAA in the absence of TPA combines with metal ions to form pure metal sulfides (CoFe-Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub>, Fig. S7,† pattern a), while NiCoFe-MOF obtained without TAA exhibits only diffraction peaks similar to those of simulated 2D Ni-MOF (Fig. S7,† pattern b). The diffraction peak of metal sulfides in NiCoFeS-MOF is positively correlated with the dosage of TAA under a constant amount of TPA (Fig. S7,† patterns c-e), indicating that the amount of sulfide embedment in the MOF structure can be adjusted by dosage of TAA. SEM images show that vertically growing NiCoFeS-MOF nanoarrays are wellaligned (Fig. S8a and b†), while CoFe-Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub> is composed of ultrathin nanosheets (Fig. S8c and d†). XRD patterns of materials formed at different reaction times (Fig. S9a†) showed that when the reaction time was 2 h, characteristic peaks corresponding to metal sulfides in NiCoFeS-MOF were more evident than those of the MOF. As the reaction time progressed from 2 h to 10 h, MOF diffraction peaks located around 8.6° gradually increased. Thus, it is likely that in the initial stage of NiCoFeS-MOF formation, metal ions in solution reacted with S<sup>2-</sup> released by TAA to form ultrathin sulfide nanosheets, which were then gradually embedded during MOF growth.35

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) of NiCoFeS-MOF shows two main characteristic peaks for Ni 2p<sub>1/2</sub> and Ni 2p<sub>3/2</sub> (Fig. 2a) at binding energies of 873.9 eV and 856.2 eV, respectively, accompanied by two distinct oscillatory satellite peaks at 880.1 eV and 861.6 eV. $^{40}$  For Fe  $2p_{1/2}$  and Fe  $2p_{3/2}$  (Fig. 2b), the corresponding feature binding energies are located at 724.2 eV and 713.3 eV, respectively.41 The fitted Co 2p curve (Fig. 2c) is divided into two spin-orbiting doublets, Co 2p<sub>1/2</sub> and Co 2p<sub>3/2</sub>, and their corresponding satellite peaks of which those at 776.3 eV and 781.9 eV confirmed the existence of Co3+ and Co<sup>2+</sup>.42,43 Compared with NiCoFe-MOF, the binding energies of Ni 2p, Fe 2p and Co 2p in NiCoFeS-MOF have a positive shift of about (0.5 to 0.9) eV. In contrast, the S 2p spectrum of NiCoFeS-

MOF (Fig. 2d) exhibits a negative shift relative to that of CoFe-Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub>. The above observations demonstrate that the introduction of sulfide nanoclusters in NiCoFeS-MOF may produce strong electronic interactions, resulting in higher valence states in negative charge environments for metal ions of S.<sup>35</sup> Furthermore, the increased electron density of Ni, Co and Fe is likely to improve their electrooxidation capacity.<sup>44</sup>

Electrochemical performance of the as-prepared electrodes was evaluated through linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves. The NiCoFeS-MOF electrode prepared using a reaction time of 5 h (Fig. S9b†) possesses the highest oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity among the electrodes prepared at other reaction times. Fig. 3a shows LSV curves of NiCoFeS-MOF in the presence and in the absence of 50 mM HMF in 1 M KOH electrolyte. The hierarchical NiCoFeS-MOF nanoarrays could achieve a current density of 50 mA cm<sup>-1</sup> at 320 mV of overpotential, which is lower than most previously reported MOF-based sulfide catalysts (Table S1†). When 50 mM HMF was added to the system, current density increased, and the onset potential shifted negatively to 1.32 V vs. RHE, indicating that HMF oxidation is more favorable. NiCoFe-MOF and CoFe-Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub> also exhibit a similar tendency (Fig. S10†) to that of the NiCoFeS-MOF electrode. According to the LSV curves shown in Fig. 3b, the NiCoFeS-MOF electrode shows the best electrocatalytic activity for HMF oxidation in alkaline media, with lower onset

potential and higher current density compared with NiCoFe-MOF or CoFe-Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub> electrodes. Compared with NiCoFe-MOF and CoFe-Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub> electrodes, the NiCoFeS-MOF electrode possesses higher current density at a given potential (Fig. 3c). Intrinsic activity of the electrodes was further investigated with Tafel slopes (Fig. 3d) in which NiCoFeS-MOF had the smallest Tafel slope (35.5 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>) among the electrodes fabricated, indicating that the NiCoFeS-MOF electrode should provide the most favorable electrocatalytic oxidation kinetics. NiS-MOF, NiCoS-MOF, and NiFeS-MOF electrodes are also able to achieve HMF oxidation at low potential compared with the OER (Fig. S11a-c†). Although the OER performance of NiS-MOF is poor (Fig. S11a†), the current flow density sharply increased in the electrolyte containing HMF, which shows that Ni species is an efficient catalytic activity center of HMF.26 It can be seen from the LSV curves (Fig. S11d†) and the corresponding Tafel plots (Fig. S11e†) that the electrocatalytic performance of NiCoS-MOF and NiFeS-MOF for HMF is better than that of NiS-MOF, and the doping with Fe is more effective than with Co for improving catalytic efficiency of Ni-based catalysts. However, the catalytic efficiency and kinetics of tri-metal-based catalyst NiCoFeS-MOF for HMF are better than those of bi- and mono-metal-based catalysts, which further reveals that there is a positive synergy between Ni, Co and Fe that became enhanced with an increase in the number of metal elements. Consequently, a simple

parameter study was carried out (molar ratio of Ni, Co, Fe precursors) under the premise that the total molar amount of metal salts was 0.96 mmol. As shown in Fig. S12,† electro-oxidation activity of the catalyst NiCoFeS-MOF on HMF first increases with an increase in Co and Fe doping content, and then decreases. NiCoFeS-MOF prepared with precursors Ni, Co and Fe with a molar ratio of 4:1:1 achieved the best performance among the combinations examined. On considering the influence of the NF on the oxidation experiments (Fig. S13†), it was found that the current density of the bare NF electrode in the electrolyte containing HMF decreased after peaking at around 1.5 V vs. RHE, which shows that the activity of bare NF against HMF oxidation is very low relative to NiCoFeS-MOF.

The intrinsic electrocatalytic properties of the prepared electrodes were evaluated in detail by estimating the electrochemical active surface area (ECSA). The double-layer capacitance ( $C_{\rm dl}$ ) is obtained from cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves measured at scan rates of 10 to 60 mV s<sup>-1</sup> (Fig. S14†), where  $C_{\rm dl}$  is positively correlated with ECSA. NiCoFeS-MOF (Fig. 3e) exhibits a much higher  $C_{\rm dl}$  value (28.1 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>) than NiCoFe-MOF or CoFe–Ni $_3$ S $_2$ , suggesting that NiCoFeS-MOF is able to provide more active sites for electrooxidation of HMF than the other materials. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed (Fig. 3f) to investigate the kinetics of NiCoFeS-MOF, NiCoFe-MOF and CoFe–Ni $_3$ S $_2$  electrodes for HMF

oxidation. An equivalent circuit was used to fit the Nyquist plot and calculate the values of each component (Table S2†) where it was found that NiCoFeS-MOF had the smallest charge transfer resistance ( $R_{\rm ct}$ ) relative to either NiCoFe-MOF or CoFe-Ni $_3$ S $_2$ , which demonstrates its faster electron transfer capability at the electrode/electrolyte interface. The above results manifest that some amount of sulfide nanoclusters loaded into MOF nanoarrays can effectively improve the HMF oxidation activity of NiCoFeS-MOF electrocatalytic electrodes.

In general, HMF oxidation can follow two different pathways (Fig. S15†). In path I, the carbonyl group of HMF is oxidized to form 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furanformic acid (HMFCA), while in path II, the hydroxyl group of HMF is oxidized to form 2,5diformylfuran (DFF). Both of these intermediates (HMFCA or DFF) are oxidized to form FFCA before being further oxidized to form FDCA. Kinetics of electrocatalysis of HMF on the NiCoFeS-MOF electrode was measured with potentiostatic oxidation experiments using 10 mL 1 M KOH with 50 mM HMF in an Hcell at an applied potential of 1.39 V vs. RHE. As the reaction progressed (Fig. S16†), the current density gradually approached zero, which was caused by the consumption of HMF. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used to monitor changes in the concentration of HMF and its oxidation products according to the coulombs transferred (Fig. 4a). As charge was transferred, the HPLC signal of HMF

gradually decreased until it disappeared, while the signal for FDCA gradually strengthened to its maximum. When the charge transfer reached 289 C, complete conversion of HMF was clearly observed and the 100% HMF conversion gave 99% FDCA yield with a Faraday efficiency of 99% (Fig. 4b), which was superior to most reported electrocatalysts (Table S2†). In addition, HPLC analyses showed the presence of the intermediate, HMFCA, rather than DFF, indicating that the electrooxidation route of HMF followed path I (Fig. S15†).

On examining the performance of the different electrodes, it was found that the efficiency of NiCoFeS-MOF for electrocatalytic oxidation of HMF into FDCA was higher than that of NiCoFe-MOF and CoFe-Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub> for the same time period (Fig. 4c), which confirmed that the sulfide nanoclusters embedded in 2D MOF promoted electrocatalytic oxidation of HMF. The NiCoFeS-MOF electrode maintained an FDCA yield of more than 98% after 12 consecutive potentiostatic oxidation cycling tests (Fig. 4d), demonstrating its excellent stability.

Detailed characterization of the used NiCoFeS-MOF electrode was performed (Fig. 5), where it can be seen (Fig. 5a) that the hierarchical nanosheet structures of the NiCoFeS-MOF were well-maintained although the surfaces became roughened compared with fresh NiCoFeS-MOF samples, which can be attributed to surface oxidation of NiCoFeS-MOF during multiple electrolytic processes. In addition, the XRD pattern of used NiCoFeS-MOF (Fig. 5b) shows that the diffraction peak for the

MOF disappears, while the diffraction peak for the metal sulfides remains. The oxyhydroxide formed during electrooxidation of HMF may protect the surrounding metal sulfides from phase transition.35 Nevertheless, although the crystal structure of the MOF in NiCoFeS-MOF changed after the cyclic electrolysis experiment due to a weakened or collapsed structure, the electrode still maintained its high catalytic performance for HMF oxidation, indicating that the electrocatalytic activity of NiCoFeS-MOF was derived from its open skeleton structure.45 XPS was conducted to analyze the chemical valence evolution of the NiCoFeS-MOF electrode (Fig. 5c) after HMF oxidation. The Ni3+ signal appeared in the Ni 2p spectrum (Fig. 5c), demonstrating that NiCoFeS-MOF underwent deep oxidation to form NiOOH, which has been reported to be the direct active substance in HMF catalytic oxidation. 46 Dominant peaks of O 1s (Fig. 5d) from M-O (531.1 eV), the O=C-O group (532.2 eV) and adsorbed H2O molecules (533.6 eV) shifted to a lower binding energy of 531.6 eV from the -OH group, further indicating the formation of oxyhydroxide during HMF oxidation.47-49 As for Co and Fe, no evident changes in their valence states were observed after electrocatalytic oxidation of HMF (Fig. S17†). Therefore, the Ni site in the NiCoFeS-MOF electrode was found to be the core catalytic center in the electrocatalytic oxidation of HMF, 49,50 in which Co and Fe played important synergistic roles with Ni.

## 4. Conclusions

In summary, a one-step solvothermal synthesis strategy using dimethylformamide and ethanol was proposed for preparing NiCoFeS-MOF electrodes on nickel foam. The NiCoFeS-MOF electrode consisted of 2D MOF nanoarrays embedded with metal sulfide nanoclusters. The NiCoFeS-MOF electrode afforded FDCA yields of 99% with Faraday efficiencies of 99% at 1.39 V vs. RHE for complete HMF conversion and it showed stable recycling performance. Metal sulfide nanoclusters in the electrode not only improved conductivity and lowered charge transfer resistance, but also allowed adjustment of the electronic structure of the active sites of catalytic atoms. The concepts presented in this work provide ideas for realizing the construction of transition metal active component electrocatalytic electrodes based on 2D metal-organic frameworks and for efficient upgrading of biomass-derived compounds with electrocatalytic methods.

Electrochemical oxidation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMFOR) to generate high-value chemicals under mild conditions acts as an energy-saving and sustainable strategy. However, it is still challenging to develop electrocatalysts with high efficiency and good durability. Here, nickel foam (NF) supported CoCrCe(7.5%)-LDH (layered double hydroxides) by doping Ce into CoCr-LDH show high 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) conversion (99%), 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) yield (99%), and Faraday efficiency (100%) at 1.4 V<sub>RHE</sub>. The CoCrCe(7.5%)-LDH also exhibits remarkable stability with 97% conversion of HMF after 10 cycles. The X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) and theoretical calculation show that Ce doping into CoCr-LDH is beneficial to the formation of high-valance Co and significantly facilitates the electron transfer, regulates the adsorption behavior of intermediates, reduces the Gibbs free energy barrier and accelerates the reaction rate. This work promotes the use of rare earth elements as electrocatalysts to promote the oxidation of HMF.

such as hydrogen gas not only reduces the dependence on fossil fuels but also is a way to sustainable development.[2-4] However, the anode reaction of water splitting is a four-electron oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which requires a relatively high overpotential and has slow kinetics.<sup>[5,6]</sup> Electrochemical oxidation of biomass instead of OER not only speeds up the reaction kinetics but also produces high-value chemicals.[7] 5-Hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), as a typical C6 biomass platform molecule, [8,9] can be converted to high-value chemicals through oxidation, hydrogenation, aldehyde, and alcohol-based ring-opening reactions. For example, HMF can be oxidized to 2,5-diformylfuran (DFF), 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furancarboxylic acid (HMFCA), 5-formylfurancarboxylic acid (FFCA), and 2,5furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA).[10] Among

them, FDCA is a favorable substrate for the synthesis of polyethylene furanoate (PEF), which can replace petroleum-based polyethylene terephthalate (PET).<sup>[11]</sup> In addition, PEF is an environmentally friendly polymer with recyclable and biodegradable properties, and has better heat resistance, mechanical strength, and gas barrier properties than PET.<sup>[12]</sup>

Currently, noble metal-based catalysts have been extensively investigated for the electrocatalytic oxidation of HMF (HMFOR).[13] However, their low reserves and high prices are obstacles to their applications. Therefore, it is still a challenge to find electrocatalysts with low prices and excellent performance. Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) as a 2D material were composed of metal cations and interlayer anions, [14] with a general form of  $[M_{1-X}^{2+}M_X^{3+}(OH)_2]^{X+}[(A)_{x/n}^{n-}\cdot mH_2O]^{X-}[^{15}]$  The M represents metal cations, and A is the interlayer anions, [16,17] respectively. Due to their special structure, they have a changeable composition and structure and have been widely used as electrocatalysts for HMFOR.[18-20] Yi et al. achieved 94.% conversion of HMF and 98% yield of FDCA at 1.47 V<sub>RHE</sub>.<sup>[21]</sup> Shao et al. achieved 99.4% Faraday efficiency (FE) at 1.52 V<sub>RHE</sub> using CoAl-LDH as electrocatalysts. [22] To further reduce the operating potentials, a doping strategy has been adopted to further improve the performance.<sup>[23]</sup> For example, Zhang et al. significantly reduced the overpotential of NiV-LDHs by doping W, and can achieve a

**Scheme 1.** Schematic of the synthesis process of CoCrCe(7.5%)-LDH.

current density of 193 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> at 1.42 V<sub>RHE</sub>.<sup>[24]</sup> Huang et al. designed Ce-doped NiFe-LDHs to achieve increased yields at low potential.<sup>[25]</sup> Through these reports, it is demonstrated that doping other metal species into LDHs could facilitate the reduction of overpotential and improve the performance of HMFOR.<sup>[26]</sup> Among the various kinds of LDH electrocatalysts, cobalt-based LDH electrocatalysts have been widely used due to their good stability and redox capacity as well as lower cost.<sup>[27,28]</sup> Previous studies have indicated that the content of Co<sup>3+</sup> in Co-based electrocatalysts can effectively decrease the oxidation potential of HMF.<sup>[29,30]</sup> As a resource-rich rare earth element, cerium can promote the formation of oxygen-active species and promote the intrinsic activity of Co-based oxides or hydroxides because of the Ce<sup>3+</sup>/Ce<sup>4+</sup> redox pair.<sup>[31-34]</sup>

Herein, in this work we designed NF-supported CoCrCe-LDH electrocatalysts by doping optimal Ce content into CoCr-LDH to oxidize HMF to FDCA under mild conditions. Typically, CoCrCe(7.5%)-LDH with nanosheet structure achieves a current density of 50.5 mA cm $^{-2}$  at 1.4  $\rm V_{RHE}$ . What's more, the HMF conversion, FDCA yield, and Faraday efficiency can reach more than 99% at 1.4  $\rm V_{RHE}$ . Doping Ce into CoCr-LDH adjusted the electronic structure and coordination environment and facilitated the formation of high-valence cobalt. DFT calculations also indicated that the doping of Ce can reduce the Gibbs free energy of intermediate formation and accelerate reaction kinetics.

#### 2. Results and Discussion

#### 2.1. Characterization of LDHs

CoCrCe(7.5%)-LDH was prepared by a one-step hydrothermal method in Scheme 1. As shown in Figure 1a, Co(OH)2 and CoCr-LDH and CoCrCe(7.5%)-LDH exhibited similar patterns, and the peaks located at 12.1°, 23.2°, 33.50°, 34.5°, 38.9°, 59.9°, and 61.2° belong to the (003), (006), (102), (015), (110), and (113) crystal planes of LDHs,[35] respectively, indicating the successful synthesis of LDHs. The sharp peaks at 44.8°, 52.3°, and 76.7° belong to nickel foam support. The morphologies of as-prepared LDHs were confirmed by SEM. For Co(OH)2, the nanoneedles covered the whole surface of NF (Figure S1a,b, Supporting Information). The CoCr-LDH displayed smooth and dense nanosheet arrays, which were anchored on the surface of NF (Figure S1c,d, Supporting Information). After the introduction of Ce, CoCrCe(7.5%)-LDH can still maintain the nanosheet morphology and structure (Figure 1b,c). The nanosheet structure of CoCrCe(7.5%)-LDH was further confirmed by TEM (Figure 1d). Based on the HRTEM image (Figure 1e), the lattice distance of 0.26 nm was attributed to the (015) crystal planes of LDH. [36] The EDS mapping showed the uniform distribution of Co, Cr, and Ce on the CoCrCe(7.5%)-LDH nanosheets (Figure 1e), further indicating the successful preparation of CoCrCe(7.5%)-LDH. ICPOES was used to detect the loading species on the NF, and the specific Co, Cr, and Ce contents are consistent with theoretical content (Table S1, Supporting Information)

### 2.2. Electrocatalytic Performance

The electrocatalytic performance of these LDHs was evaluated in 1 м КОН or 1 м КОН with 50 mм HMF using a standard threeelectrode system. As shown in the LSV curves (Figure S2, Supporting Information), the overpotentials of Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> for HMFOR and OER at 10 mA cm $^{-2}$  were 1.44 and 1.56  $V_{\rm RHE}$ , respectively. To further improve the performance, CoCr-LDHs (Figures S3, S4, Supporting Information) with different levels of Cr doping were prepared (see Supporting Information for details of the synthesis) and the CoCr-LDHs maintained a dense smooth nanosheet structure. As shown in the LSV curves (Figure S5, Supporting Information), the onset potentials of HMFOR over CoCr-LDHs are lower than that of Co(OH)2, and the same tendency was also shown in the OER, suggesting that Cr doping improved the performance of HMOR and OER. Among these samples, Co<sub>0.7</sub>Cr<sub>0.3</sub>-LDH, which was simply called later as CoCr-LDH, exhibited the best HMFOR performance. On this basis, CoCr-LDH was further modified by different ratios of Ce doping (2.5%, 5%, 7.5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, and 40%, respectively). As shown in the XRD patterns (Figure S6, Supporting Information) and SEM images (Figures S7, S8, Supporting Information), the nanosheet structure of CoCrCe-LDHs was still maintained after doping with Ce. The electrocatalytic performance of Ce-doped CoCr-LDH samples were further tested and CoCrCe(7.5%)-LDH exhibited the best performance (Figure \$9, Supporting Information). As summarized in the LSV curves (Figure 2a) of Co(OH)2, CoCr-LDH and CoCrCe(7.5%)-LDH, CoCrCe(7.5%)-LDH showed lower overpotential only 1.33  $V_{RHE}$  at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, as compared with 1.44  $V_{RHE}$ for  $Co(OH)_2$  and 1.35  $V_{\text{RHE}}$  for CoCr-LDH. The effect of nickel foam is almost negligible. In addition, as shown in Figure 2b, CoCrCe(7.5%)-LDH showed a current density of 50.5 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> at 1.40  $V_{\text{RHE}}$ , which is roughly twice as much as that of CoCr-LDH (26.5 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>) and eight times as much as that of Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> (5.85 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>). As shown in Figure 2c, the Tafel slope of CoCrCe(7.5%)-LDH for HMFOR was determined to be 56.46 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>, much lower than that of CoCr-LDH (99.29 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>) and  $Co(OH)_2$  (234.72 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>), indicating CoCrCe(7.5%)-LDH has a

faster reaction kinetic.[\[37\]](#page-8-0) The electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) was obtained by cyclic voltammetry, which can further illustrate the difference in performance. As shown in Figure S10 (Supporting Information), the CV curves in the non-Faraday region under different sweep speeds, in which the current response is only related to the Cdl. As displayed in Figure [2d,](#page-3-0) the capacitance of Co(OH)2 was 59.32 mF cm<sup>−</sup>2, while the capacitance of CoCr-LDH and CoCrCe(7.5%)-LDH were 4.07 and 14.85 mF cm<sup>−</sup>2, respectively. Compared to Co(OH)2, the Cdl of CoCr-LDH decreased, but the activity increased, proving Cr doping can enhance the intrinsic activity of Co(OH)2. [\[38\]](#page-8-0) Compared to CoCr-LDH, the Cdl of CoCrCe(7.5%)-LDH increased, indicating more active sites were exposed to improve the electrochemical activity. The catalytic kinetics of this electrode during HMF oxidation was revealed by EIS. The oxidation behavior that occurs in the lowfrequency region (10<sup>−</sup>2–101) was at the interface between the electrode and electrolyte, while oxidation within the electrode occurs in the high-frequency region (101–105 Hz).[\[39\]](#page-8-0) The specific equivalent circuit diagrams are shown in Figure S11 (Supporting Information). From the Nyquist plots in Figure [2e,](#page-3-0) the CoCrCe(7.5%)- LDH exhibited a smaller radius in comparison to Co(OH)2 and CoCr-LDH, indicating CoCrCe(7.5%)-LDH has a better charge transfer capability and electronic conductivity.[\[40\]](#page-8-0) After doping with Ce, the potential of CoCrCe(7.5%)-LDH for HMFOR is 217 mV lower than that of OER at 50 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> (Figure [2f\)](#page-3-0). Compared to Co(OH)2, the potential of CoCrCe(7.5%)-LDH for OER and HMFOR decreased by 80 and 110 mV at 10 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2. Since HMF oxidation can take place at lower potentials than OER, HM- FOR can not only reduce energy but also produce high-value products by replacing OER. All these suggested that doping with Cr and Ce can improve the electrocatalytic activity of Co(OH)2 for HMFOR because of the improved intrinsic activity, accelerated charge transfer, and fasted reaction kinetic.

HMF has both an aldehyde group and a hydroxyl group, so there are two pathways for oxidation, one is the oxidation of the hydroxyl group to DFF, and then further oxidation to FFCA. The other one is the oxidation of the aldehyde group to HM-FCA, and then further oxidation of HMFCA to FFCA. The FFCA was oxidized to FDCA with two carboxylic acid groups (**Figure 3**[a\)](#page-4-0).[\[41\]](#page-8-0) Moreover, the calibration curves of HMF, FDCA, and intermediates could be used for quantitative analyses of products during electrolysis (Figure S12, Supporting Information). Figure [3b](#page-4-0) shows the changes in substance concentration as the reaction progressed at 1.40 VRHE, indicating that HMF is completely oxidized to FDCA and no other substances in 2 h, and only a small amount of HMFCA was detected during the reaction, no FFCA or DFF was detected, suggesting that the second pathway occurred in this reaction. Figure [3c](#page-4-0) shows the conversion trend at a low potential of 1.35 VRHE as the reaction process, the HMF is still eventually completely converted to FDCA, suggesting the CoCrCe(7.5%)-LDH has excellent selectivity. Furthermore, durability test was conducted to evaluate the stability of CoCrCe(7.5%)-LDH (Figure [3d\)](#page-4-0). It is clear that the LSV curves before and after 2000 CV cycles largely overlap. Moreover, the CoCrCe(7.5%)-LDH showed a slight decay after 10 h of chronoamperometric test. Recycling experiments were

conducted to assess the recovery ability of CoCrCe(7.5%)-LDH to oxidize HMF at 1.4 VRHE, showing excellent stability after 10 cycles, with the conversion of HMF, yield, and FE of FDCA maintained above 97% (Figure [3e\)](#page-4-0). In comparison to some reported HMFOR catalysts, the HMFOR performance of CoCrCe(7.5%)- LDH in our work is quite competitive, as illustrated in Table S2 (Supporting Information). In addition, a series of characterizations such as XRD, SEM, TEM, XPS, and ICP were done for CoCrCe(7.5%)-LDH after HMFOR. The characteristic peaks of LDH disappeared in XRD (Figure S13, Supporting Information) probably due to the reconfiguration during the reaction process. SEM and TEM results (Figures S14, S15a, Supporting Information) also show that the morphology of the nanosheets is maintained after the reaction, proving the superiority and structural stability of the catalyst. Furthermore, the original lattice fringes of Co(OH)2 disappeared and a new lattice spacing of 0.215 nm appears(Figure S15b, Supporting Information), matching the 102 crystal plane of CoOOH.[\[42\]](#page-8-0) For the XPS after the reaction, there is no change in Cr 2p and Ce 3d. However, the peak (Figure S16, Supporting Information) located at 784.8 eV belongs to Co<sup>3</sup><sup>+</sup> of Co 2p,[\[43\]](#page-8-0) indicating that Co2<sup>+</sup> was oxidized to high valence states, which matches the TEM result. Based on the ICP results after the reaction (Table S3, Supporting Information), it was found that the content of the elements remained essentially unchanged. These experimental results indicated that CoCrCe(7.5%)-LDH is an efficient and stable electrocatalyst for HMFOR.

#### **2.3. The role of Cr and Ce in the Electrochemical Performance**

Different ratios of CoCe-LDHs and CrCe-LDHs were also synthesized using the same method to illustrate the role of Cr and Ce. The XRD and SEM images of these different proportions of CoCe-LDHs and CrCe-LDHs are shown in Figures S17–S19 (Supporting Information). The morphologies of CoCe-LDHs and CrCe-LDHs are nanoneedles and nanosheets, respectively, indicating that Cr plays an important role in modulating the morphological structure. The different ratios of CoCe-LDHs and CrCe-LDHs were tested following the same operation (Figure S20, Supporting Information). Both CoCe-LDHs and CrCe-LDHs showed poor HMFOR performance compared to different ratios of CoCr-LDHs, among which the overpotentials of Co0.7Ce0.3-LDH and Cr0.6Ce0.4-LDH at 10 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> were 1.375 and 1.464 VRHE, respectively. The morphological structure can be modulated by doping Cr, which can expose more active sites, as well as good contact between the electrode and electrolyte, and thus improve the reactivity.[\[44\]](#page-8-0) The XPS results also proved that Cr can adjust the electronic structure. Through the comparison of CoCr-LDHs and CoCrCe-LDHs (Figures S5 and S9, Supporting Information), Ce and Cr both changed their electronic structure, thus the high catalytic performance was achieved. The LSV curves of CoCr-LDHs, CoCe-LDHs, and CrCe-LDHs showed that the main active center is the cobalt site.

In the Co 2p XPS spectra of Co(OH)2 (**Figure 4**[a\)](#page-4-0), the binding energies of Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2 are located at 780.9 and 797.2 eV,

with shakeup satellites peaks located at 787.7 and 802.2 eV, respectively, indicating the presence of Co<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> in Co(OH)2. [\[45\]](#page-8-0) Compared to Co(OH)2, the Co 2p XPS spectra in CoCr-LDH and CoCrCe(7.5%)-LDH were shifted toward higher binding energies by ≈0.44 and 1.02 eV, respectively. However, for the Co 2p XPS spectra of Co0.6Ce0.4-LDH, the peaks were only positive shift 0.23 eV in Figure S21 (Supporting Information). Based on the XPS results of CoCr-LDH and Co0.6Ce0.4-LDH, it can be found that in the bimetallic LDHs both Cr and Ce can modulate the electronic environment of Co, but Cr has a stronger electronic modulation ability than Ce. While in CoCrCe(7.5%)-LDH, Cr and Ce showed much stronger synergy capabilities. For Cr 2p XPS spectra in CoCr-LDH (Figure 4b), the peaks located at 576.25 and 585.84 eV belong to Cr 2p3/2 and Cr 2p1/2 for Cr<sup>3</sup><sup>+</sup>, and peaks at 578.17 and 587.71 eV were assigned to Cr6<sup>+</sup> because some of the Cr<sup>3</sup><sup>+</sup> were oxidized to a higher valence state during the hydrothermal process.[\[46\]](#page-8-0) After Ce doping, the peaks shifted 0.52 eV toward lower binding energy, indicating Ce affected the electronic structure of Cr species. Meanwhile, the Ce 3d XPS spectra of CoCrCe(7.5%)-LDH can be divided into Ce 3d3/2 and Ce 3d5/2 (Figure 4c). The peaks with binding energies of 874.26, 878.88, and 899.11 eV were assigned to Ce3<sup>+</sup>, and the peaks

located at 882.24, 886.24, and 903.73 eV were attributed to Ce4<sup>+</sup>. [\[47\]](#page-8-0) These results indicated that Ce<sup>3</sup><sup>+</sup> is the dominant species in CoCrCe(7.5%)-LDH, with Ce species actinmg as electron acceptor sites and Co and Cr as electron donors, the electrons transfer from Co and Cr to Ce. All these results demonstrated that the introduction of Cr and Ce leads to a change in the electronic structure.

Valence changes are further investigated by X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES). First, The K-edge of CoCr-LDH is similar to that of CoCrCe(7.5%)-LDH, but the edge is closer to that of CoO as compared to Co foil, where CoCrCe(7.5%)-LDH shifted more toward higher binding energies as compared to CoCr-LDH, suggesting that the valence of Co is increased by Ce doping (**Figure 5**a).[\[48\]](#page-8-0) Furthermore, in Figure 5b, the Cr K-edge are more similar to Cr2O3 than Cr foil, where CoCrCe(7.5%)-LDH has a higher binding energy, indicating an increase in the valence of Cr. In general, the shift to higher energies in the Co and Cr K-edge spectra of CoCrCe(7.5%)-LDH suggests that Co and Cr have lost electrons (Figure 5a,b). The shift of the edge position toward lower energies compared toCeO2 suggested that Ce is mainly present as Ce3<sup>+</sup> (Figure 5c), which is consistent with the XPS results.

DFT calculations were further carried out to elucidate the electronic mechanism of Ce-doping to promote HMFOR. The optimized structural models of Co(OH)2, CoCr-LDH, and CoCrCe(7.5%)-LDH are shown in **Figure 6**[a–c.](#page-6-0) The differential charge density of CoCrCe(7.5%)-LDH was calculated to account for the electronic interactions between different atoms. It was found that the electrons are transferred from Co and Cr to Ce in Figure [6d,](#page-6-0) which agrees with the XPS results. Moreover, the electronic density of states (DOS) of CoCrCe(7.5%)-LDH, Co(OH)2, and CoCr-LDH are shown in Figure [6e](#page-6-0) and Figure S22 (Supporting Information). Co(OH)2 exhibited a typical semiconductor property with a bandgap around the Fermi level.[\[49\]](#page-8-0) The bandgap of CoCr-LDH and CoCrCe(7.5%) -LDH decreased and showed a continuous electronic states, which illustrates it is a metallic property.[\[50\]](#page-8-0)

The doping with Cr and Ce can narrow the bandgap and has a high conductivity, facilitating accelerated charge transfer.[\[51\]](#page-8-0) Furthermore, the bonding strengths of OH\* and HMF on the catalyst surface are a key descriptor of the catalytic activity. The adsorption configurations of OH\* and HMF on Co(OH)2, CoCr-LDH, and CoCrCe(7.5%)-LDH in Figures S23, S24 (Supporting Information). As shown in Figure [6f,](#page-6-0) the bonding strengths of OH\* and HMF to Co(OH)2 are −1.26 and −1.84 eV. For CoCr-LDH and CoCrCe(7.5%)-LDH the binding strengths of OH\* are −1.35 and −1.66 eV, and the binding strengths of HMF are −1.94 and −2.24 eV, respectively. Compared with Co(OH)2 and CoCr-LDH, the OH\* and HMF are more easily adsorbed on the CoCrCe(7.5%)- LDH surface, and the open-circuit potential (OCP) curves also showed that CoCrCe(7.5%)-LDH had a stronger surface adsorption capacity for HMF than the other two samples (Figure S25, Supporting Information).[\[52,53\]](#page-8-0) Thus proper adsorption on the catalyst surface can promote the electrocatalytic performance.[\[54\]](#page-8-0) Furthermore, Figure [6g](#page-6-0) shows the free energies step of HMFOR on Co(OH)2, CoCr-LDH, and CoCrCe(7.5%)- LDH. It was found that the rate-determining step (RDS) of Co(OH)2 and CoCr-LDH is HMF to HMFCA, and the energy change of 1.01 and 0.86 eV, respectively. The RDS of CoCrCe(7.5%)-LDH is HMFCA to FFCA, with RDS energy changes of 0.78 eV. These results indicated that the doping of Ce not only modulates the adsorption of intermediates but also reduces the Gibbs free energy of RDS in HM-FOR, thus improving the reaction kinetics and faster charge transfer.

## **3. Conclusion**

In summary, a self-supporting CoCrCe(7.5%)-LDH electrode is successfully prepared by one-step hydrothermal method and used as anode for the selective electrocatalytic oxidation of HMF. CoCrCe(7.5%)-LDH exhibited superior catalytic performance, even after 10 cycles its HMF conversion, FDCA yield, and Faraday efficiency remained at 97%, and the current density of CoCrCe(7.5%)-LDH is roughly two and eight times of the other two samples at 1.4 VRHE. In addition, the nanosheet structure is conducive to increasing the contact between the electrodes and the electrolyte, which promotes mass transfer during the reaction. Furthermore, XPS and XANES also showed that Ce doping regulates the electronic structure of Co and favors the formation of high-valence cobalt. According to the analysis of DFT calculations, the doping of Ce can change the adsorption behavior of the intermediates, reducing the Gibbs free energy barrier, promoting electron transfer, and accelerating the reaction rate. In this work, we designed an efficient rare earth element electrocatalyst for

Technology Co., Ltd. Throughout the experiment, deionized water produced by an ultra-pure purification equipment was used.

Synthesis of  $Co(OH)_2$ : All samples were grown in situ by hydrothermal methods. A clean piece of Ni foam  $(2 \times 4 \text{ cm}^2)$  was taken and sonicated with 2 M HCl, ethanol, and deionized water for 15 min to remove surface oxide species, and then dried at 60 °C for 6 h to finally obtain the pretreated Ni foam.  $Co(NO_3)_2 \cdot 6H_2O$  (3.5 mmol) and urea (11.5 mmol) were dissolved in deionized water (35 mL), and stirred for 30 min at room temperature. The solution and the treated nickel foam were transferred to a 50 mL reactor and reacted at 180 °C for 12 h. The reaction products were ultrasonically cleaned with deionized water for repeated three times and dried at 80 °C for 6 h.

Synthesis of CoCr-LDH:  $Co(NO_3)_2 \cdot 6H_2O$  (2.45 mmol),  $Cr(NO_3)_3 \cdot 9H_2O$  (1.05 mmol) and urea (11.5 mmol) were dissolved in deionized water (35 mL) and stirred for 30 min at room temperature. The solution and the treated nickel foam were transferred to a 50 mL reactor and reacted at 180 °C for 12 h. The reaction products were ultrasonically cleaned with deionized water with three times, and dried at

<span id="page-7-0"></span>80 °C for 6 h. CoCr-LDHs, CoCe-LDHs, and CrCe-LDHs were synthesized according to the same method, but the total amount of metal salts was kept at 3.5 mmol.

*Synthesis of CoCrCe-LDHs*: CoCrCe(7.5%)-LDH was prepared by a onestep hydrothermal method, CoCrCe(%)-LDHs with other Ce doping content were synthesized in one step following the same method, in which %Ce refers to the molar percentage of Ce to the total molar amount of Co(NO3)2·6H2O and Cr(NO3)3·9H2O. The above samples were named as CoCr-LDH, CoCrCe(2.5%)-LDH, CoCrCe(5%)-LDH, CoCrCe(10%)-LDH, CoCrCe(20%)-LDH, CoCrCe(30%)-LDH, and CoCrCe(40%)-LDH.

*Electrochemical Measurements*: The electrochemical measurements were performed in a typical three-electrode cell. A piece of the prepared self-supported catalyst with 1 × 1 cm2, graphite rod, and Ag/AgCl was applied as the working electrode, counter electrode, and reference electrode, respectively. The working electrolytes for OER process and HMFOR process were 1 M KOH (pH 14) and 1 m KOH with HMF (50 mm, pH 14), respectively. According to the Nernst equation (Equation 1), the measured potentials (vs Ag/AgCl) were stated with regard to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale:

$$E (versus RHE) = E (versus Ag/AgCl) + 0.0199 + 0.059 \times pH$$
 (1)

Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves with 90-iR compensation were collected at a scan rate of 5 mV s<sup>−</sup>1. Electrochemical surface area (ECSA) is computed using the following formula (Equation 2):

$$ECSA = C_{dI}/C_{s}$$
 (2)

here, Cdl indicates the double-layer capacitance acquired from CV cycles, Cs is the specific capacitance. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were carried out in the frequency range of 105–10<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> Hz with an AC amplitude of 5 mV.

*Quantitative Analysis of Products*: High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC, Agilent 1260 Infinity Series, USA) with an UV–vis detector and an Agilent Zorbax SB-C18 (150 mm × 4.6 mm, 5 μm) column was used to qualitatively and quantitatively analyze the content of substances. The UV–vis detector had a wavelength of 265 nm. The column temperature was set at 30 °C. HPLC separation was performed using an isocraticelution 5.0 mm ammonium formate solution as mobile phases A and methanol as mobile phases B, with a volume ratio of 7:3. The rate of flow was fixed at 0.6 mL min−<sup>1</sup> and each separation over 10 min. The concentration of HMF and products was detected using the corresponding calibration curves. The HMF conversion, product yield, and Faraday efficiency (FE) value of FDCA were calculated using the following equations ((Equations 3–5):

HMF conversion (%) = [(mole of consumed HMF)

/ (mole of initial HMF] 
$$\times$$
 100 (3)

Product Yield(%) = [(mole of certain formed product)

$$/(\text{mole of initial HMF})] \times 100$$
 (4)

Faradaic efficiency(%) = [(mole of formed FDCA)∕(Charge∕(6 × F))]

×100 (5)

where F is the Faraday constant (96 485 C mol<sup>−</sup>1). The electrochemical oxidation reaction's theoretical charge was calculated to 86.8 C.

*Characterization*: X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were acquired through a diffractometer (D/max-B, Rigaku, Japan) with Cu K radiation ( = 0.15432 Å). The morphology and microstructure were obtained by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, Hitachi SU8010, Japan) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, FEI Talos F200x, USA). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo Scientific K-Alpha, USA) was used to collect information on elements in composite materials. The exact metal contents were conducted by an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES, Agilent 725, ES).

*Computational Methods*: Based on the projection-enhanced wave (PAW) approach, the Vienna Atomic Number Simulation Package (VASP) was used for all spin polarization DFT computations. The electron-ion interaction was described in terms of the conventional PAW potential. The plane wave base set was utilized to increase the wave function's smooth cross-section with a 400 eV cutoff kinetic energy. A variant of the general gradient approximation (GGA), the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) parameterization function was used during the electron-to-electron exchange and correlated interactions. The slab model was used to the surface in order to study the mechanistic chemistry of the surface process. To ensure good separation of periodic images, a sufficiently large vacuum area15 was selected. In determining the properties of the surface, the bottom atoms were fixed in the body position during the geometric optimization process.

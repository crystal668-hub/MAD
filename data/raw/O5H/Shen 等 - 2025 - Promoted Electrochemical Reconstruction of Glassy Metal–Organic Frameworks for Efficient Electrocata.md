**Glassy metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) featured with excellent ionic conductivity and processability have attracted tremendous attention, yet remaining unexplored for electrocatalytic 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) oxidation. Herein, developed as the first example of glassy MOFs for electrocatalytic HMF oxidation reaction (HMFOR), glassy ZIF-CoNi (ZIF-CoNi(g)) is prepared via a ball-milling and melt-quenching two-step process, which is further electrochemically treated by cyclic voltammetry. The obtained surface reconstructed ZIF-CoNi(g) (R-ZIF-CoNi(g)) exhibits excellent HMFOR performance, with 100% HMF conversion, 99.6% 2,5-furandicar-boxylic acid (FDCA) yield, and 98.5% FDCA faradaic efficiency (FE) achieved at 1.48 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). Remarkably, with R-ZIF-CoNi(g) as the anode and Pt/C as the cathode, the integrated membrane electrode assembly (MEA) electrolyzer could reach a current density of 100 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> at 1.68 V for simultaneous HMFOR and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Experimental results and theoretical calculations demonstrate that the disordered Co–N bond arrangement and then the weakened Co–N bond would promote electrochemical reconstruction happened to ZIF-CoNi(g) with abundant CoOOH active sites created, which benefit HMF dynamic adsorption and HMFOR kinetics.

## **1. Introduction**

As derived from sustainable biomass resource, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) has been considered as one of the key bio-based platform molecules to produce diverse value-added chemicals, e.g., 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA), 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furancarboxylic acid (HMFCA) and dialdehyde furfuryl (DFF), via multielectron involved oxidation reactions.[\[1\]](#page-7-0) Among these oxidation products, FDCA could be utilized as the precursor to produce bio-based polymers with broad applications in engineering plastics, medicines, textiles, etc.[\[2\]](#page-7-0) Generally, FDCA could be obtained from HMF via thermochemical oxidation, chemical oxidation and electrocatalytic oxidation. Therein, electrochemical oxidation of HMF to FDCA has been considered as a "green" catalytic process that could be operated at ambient temperature and pressure without need for noble metals and toxic solvents.[\[3\]](#page-7-0) More importantly, electrocatalytic HMF oxidation reaction (HMFOR) could serve as an alternative oxidation half reaction to replace the kinetically sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline water electrolysis,

which could significantly improve the electrocatalytic performance for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER)[\[4\]](#page-7-0) with value-added FDCA obtained as the main oxidation product.[\[5\]](#page-7-0) Nonetheless, challenges still remain for electrocatalytic HMFOR, such as the unsatisfying activity and selectivity as well as the competitive OER.[\[6\]](#page-7-0) It is thus essential to discover electrocatalysts with superior HMFOR kinetics overwhelming the competitive OER, toward high FDCA production activity and selectivity.[\[7\]](#page-7-0) Recently, cost-effective transition metals (e.g., Co, Ni, Mn, Cu, etc.) based oxides and hydroxides have attracted extensive attentions for electrocatalytic HMFOR with superb activities competitive to noble metals contained electrocatalysts.[\[8\]](#page-7-0) For example, some Co-based electrocatalysts have been documented as excellent candidates for HMFOR, with onset potentials much lower than OER.[\[9\]](#page-7-0) As illustrated by in situ spectral investigations, Co-based electrocatalysts would undergo a electrochemical reconstruction process during

HMFOR with CoOOH species generated as active sites.<sup>[10]</sup> In recent years, Co based metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have been suggested to be of great potentials in electrocatalysis, thanks to the tunable and diverse chemical structures<sup>[11]</sup> and morphological properties.<sup>[12]</sup> However, the currently reported MOFs electrocatalysts are still suffered from some intrinsic drawbacks, such as the limited powder processability,<sup>[13]</sup> the difficult exposure of active sites, and the poor electrical conductivity.

Notably, some zeolite imidazole frameworks (ZIFs) with decomposition temperature (T<sub>d</sub>) higher than melting point  $(T_m)$ , such as ZIF-62  $[Zn(Im)_{2-x}(bIm)_x]$  (Im-imidazole, bImbenzimidazole), ZIF-62(Co)  $[Co(Im)_{2-x}(bIm)_x]$ , and ZIF-4 [Zn(Im)<sub>2</sub>],<sup>[14]</sup> were reported to be melted and quenched to the glassy state with identical chemical compositions.[15] In this case, the melting process would enable electrocatalysts to be effectively adhered onto substrates, and thus the problem of difficult processability is expected to be solved for powdery MOFs electrocatalysts, which always require binders for coating on substrates with surface active sites blocked for retarded electrocatalysis. Moreover, glassy ZIFs have been favored with their high potential porosity and excellent ionic conductivity, [14b] and thus be of great potentials in catalysis. Specifically, glassy MOFs hold charge transfer ability superior to crystalline MOFs, [16] with abundant structure defects favoring electrocatalysis.[17] For example, Song et al.[16] introduced glassy ZIF-62(Co) onto various metal oxide photoanodes, which exhibited much improved photoelectrochemical activity for water oxidation. It was evidenced that the glassy ZIF-62(Co) with excellent ionic conductivity could effectively promote charge transfer and separation as well as accelerate OER kinetics. With Fe nodes incorporated ZIF-62(Co) as precursor, Lin et al. successfully prepared Co-Fe bimetallic ZIF-62 glass by melt-quenching, [18] which exhibited significantly enhanced OER activity, thanks to the open active sites and improved interfacial electron transfer between MOFs and substrate after glassification. Despite of very limited examples, these successes would be most assuredly inspiring for us to explore the potentials of glassy ZIFs in electrocatalysis for highly efficient and selective HMF oxidation, with actual active sites generated via further surface electrochemical reconstruction as expected.[19]

In this study, starting with a mixture of nickel acetylacetonate (Ni(acac)<sub>2</sub>) and hydrothermally synthesized ZIF-62(Co) (ZIF-Co), a novel ZIF-CoNi glass (ZIF-CoNi(g)) supported on copper foam (CF) was obtained via a ball-milling and melt-quenching two-step process, which was further electrochemically treated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) with surface reconstruction promoted for efficient electrocatalytic HMFOR. Believed as the first example of glassy MOFs used for electrocatalytic HMFOR, the obtained electrochemically reconstructed ZIF-CoNi(g) (R-ZIF-CoNi(g)) reveals excellent HMFOR activity with current density reaching 70 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> at 1.48 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), much higher than the electrochemically reconstructed ZIF-CoNi (R-ZIF-CoNi) as reference (32 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> at 1.48 V versus RHE). Moreover, R-ZIF-CoNi(g) affords an overall HMFOR performance with 100% HMF conversion, 99.6% FDCA yield, and 98.5% faradaic efficiency (FE) at 1.48 V versus RHE. It is experimentally and theoretically illustrated that the glassification process would induce the disordering of Co-N bond structure with weakened Co-N bond strength, which is evidenced to promote electrochemical reconstruction of ZIF-CoNi(g), with abundant CoOOH active sites created in R-ZIF-CoNi(g), contributing to the improved dynamic HMF adsorption ability and the accelerated reaction kinetics for excellent HMFOR performance. Encouragingly, with R-ZIF-CoNi(g) as the anode and platinum carbon as the cathode, the membrane electrode assembly (MEA) electrolyzer could operate at a cell voltage of 1.68 V to reach a current density of 100 mA cm $^{-2}$  as high for simultaneous HMFOR and HER, with 96.8% FDCA yield and 91.6% FDCA FE.

#### 2. Results and Discussion

In this study, starting with a precursory mixture of ZIF-62(Co) (ZIF-Co) and nickel acetylacetonate (Ni(acac),), glassy ZIF-CoNi (ZIF-CoNi(g)) was coated on the copper foam (CF) through a ball-milling (Step 1) and melt-quenching (Step 2) two-step process, which was then treated via cyclic voltammetry (CV) (Step 3) to obtain electrochemically reconstructed ZIF-CoNi(g), noted as R-ZIF-CoNi(g) (Figure 1a, see Experimental Section for Details in Supporting Information). Specifically, ZIF-CoNi is successfully supported on CF (Figure S1a, Supporting Information) via ball-milling, which exists at an isolated state of granular particles (Figure S1b, Supporting Information) and is then transformed to a smooth and molten state for ZIF-CoNi(g) after melt-quenching (Figure S2, Supporting Information). It is believed that the glassification induced intimate contact between CF and ZIF-CoNi(g) should be beneficial to the interfacial charge transfer for efficient electrocatalysis.[18,20] As supported by X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns (Figure S3, Supporting Information), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) measurements (Figure \$4, Supporting Information), glassification should have happened to ZIF-CoNi supported on CF substrate via melt-quenching, revealing an amorphous structure (Figure S5, Supporting Information),<sup>[21]</sup> with metallic Ni clusters distributed in ZIF-CoNi(g) (Figure 1b and Figure S6, Supporting Information) as identified by the Ni (011) plane with lattice spacing determined to be 0.207 nm (Figure 1c). Despite of the almost unchanged chemical structures as evidenced by liquid-state <sup>1</sup>H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) (Figure S7, Supporting Information) and Fourier transforms infrared (FTIR) spectra (Figure S8, Supporting Information), the FTIR band centered at 335 cm<sup>-1</sup>, attributed to the stretching motion of Co-N bonds, is obviously weakened for ZIF-CoNi(g) relative to ZIF-CoNi, which should be related to the disordered Co-N bond arrangement in the amorphous structure of glassified ZIF framework.<sup>[22]</sup> Moreover, for ZIF-CoNi(g), the Co-N band is shifted to lower wavenumber, indicating the weaker bonds of Co-N groups, which are more vulnerable to the electrochemical reconstruction than those in ZIF-CoNi.[17] Through CV treatment, a significant change in morphology is notable for R-ZIF-CoNi(g) with surface reconstructed to a coarse and flake-like structure (Figure S9, Supporting Information), which would endow R-ZIF-CoNi(g) with abundant active sites at surface for electrocatalysis. Meanwhile, CoOOH phases are formed for R-ZIF-CoNi(g) during electrochemical reconstruction (Figure 1d), as identified by the (003) and (012) planes of CoOOH phase with interplanar distances determined to be 0.442 nm and 0.235 nm, respectively (Figure 1e), which could be also affirmed by the aggregated Co species as revealed in elemental mappings (Figure S10,

Supporting Information). With dynamic electrochemical reconstruction processes happened to both ZIF-CoNi and ZIF-CoNi(g) (Figure S11, Supporting Information), one should further notice the stronger oxidation peaks and the higher current densities in CV curves for ZIF-CoNi(g) than ZIF-CoNi, which suggests that the electrochemical reconstruction could be promoted by the glassification of ZIF framework, with more surface active sites created in R-ZIF-CoNi(g) for electrocatalysis, as evidenced by the increased electrochemical active surface areas (ECSAs) (Figure 1f and Figure S12, Supporting Information).

With CoOOH phases, considered as the electrochemically active sites, created in R-ZIF-CoNi(g) via electrochemical reconstruction, the electrocatalytic activity for HMFOR was evaluated over the obtained R-ZIF-CoNi(g) electrode in a three-electrode system in 1 m KOH electrolyte containing 10 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>3</sup> m HMF. With glassification happened to the ZIF framework, the obtained R-ZIF-CoNi(g) electrode exhibits much improved electrocatalytic activity for HMFOR, as compared to R-ZIF-CoNi (Figure 1g). Note the higher current density obtained for R-ZIF-CoNi(g) than R-ZIF-Co(g) without Ni species introduced (Figure S13, Supporting Information), which could be explained that Ni species, serving as additional active sites, should be beneficial to HMFOR electrocatalysis. By optimizing the feeding ratios of Ni:Co in the precursory mixture of Ni(acac)2 and ZIF-Co, the highest current density could reach 70 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> at 1.48 V versus RHE (Figure S13 and Table S1, Supporting Information), about two times that of R-ZIF-CoNi (Figure 1g). To achieve the current densities of 10, 50, and 100 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> for HMFOR, the applied potentials required for R-ZIF-CoNi(g) are much reduced by 60, 90, 110 mV as compared to R-ZIF-CoNi (Figure S14, Supporting Information), respectively. Moreover, the onset potentials for HMFOR over both R-ZIF-CoNi and R-ZIF-CoNi(g) are remarkably cathodically shifted relative to that for OER (Figure 1g). Especially, R-ZIF-CoNi(g) requires an applied potential of only 1.36 V versus

RHE to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> for HMFOR, about 165 mV lower than that for OER. More encouragingly, in comparison to R-ZIF-CoNi, R-ZIF-CoNi(g) displays much superior overall activity of HMFOR (Figure 1h) at 1.48 V versus RHE as the optimized applied potential (Figure S15, Supporting Information), with HMF conversion, FDCA yield and FE increased from 93.0%, 91.3% and 90.1% to 100%, 99.6% and 98.5%, respectively.

All the above analytic and comparative results demonstrate that glassification could promote the electrochemical reconstruction process with abundant active sites created for the improved electrocatalytic activity, enabling R-ZIF-CoNi(g) to serve as an excellent electrocatalyst for HMFOR. In the following sections, R-ZIF-CoNi(g) of optimized Ni content was thus characterized and analyzed with R-ZIF-CoNi as reference, if without specifically noted. Except for the increased ECSAs as the determinant to the improved HMFOR activity achieved for R-ZIF-CoNi(g) (Figure 1f), the intrinsic contribution of glassified ZIF framework to the charge transfer behaviors was then proposed to be informed from some electrochemical analysis including electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) plots and Tafel slopes. By fitting the Nyquist plots (Table S2, Supporting Information) using an equivalent circuit (Figure \$16, Supporting Information, inset), the bulk charge transport resistance ( $R_{tran}$ ) is observed to be significantly lower for R-ZIF-CoNi(g) (0.48  $\Omega$ ) than R-ZIF-CoNi (1.26  $\Omega$ ), which suggests that the glassified ZIF framework with disordered Co-N bonds and the tight interfacial contact between amorphous ZIF and CF should favor the charge transfer from bulk to surface, contributing to promoted electrochemical reconstruction process. Moreover, the interfacial charge transfer resistance ( $R_{\rm ct}$ ) of R-ZIF-CoNi(g) is much lower than that of R-ZIF-CoNi, indicating the greatly promoted charge transfer process at the interface of R-ZIF-CoNi(g) and electrolyte (Figure S16, Supporting Information). Such significant improvement in charge transfer ability should be responsible to the accelerated HMFOR kinetics for R-ZIF-CoNi(g), as evidenced by its much lowered Tafel slope (99 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>) as compared to that of R-ZIF-CoNi (125 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>) (Figure S17, Supporting Information).

Given that the metallic Ni species observed in ZIF-CoNi(g) (Figures S6 and S18, Supporting Information) would not change the Co chemical states in glassy ZIF framework (Figure S19, Supporting Information), and thereby Ni species serves as the additional active sites to improve HMFOR performance, as previously reported.<sup>[23]</sup> In this study, the underlying effects of glassification on the electrochemical reconstruction and then the electrocatalytic HMFOR performances were explored for further. From the perspective of chemical states, as shown in the Co 2p X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) (Figure 2a), with two peaks of Co 2p<sub>3/2</sub> and Co  $2p_{1/2}$  observed at  $\approx$ 781.0 and 796.3 eV,<sup>[24]</sup> respectively, attributed to Co<sup>2+[25]</sup> for both ZIF-CoNi and ZIF-CoNi(g), it could be deduced that glassification would not significantly change the chemical structure, as previously supported by NMR and FTIR spectra. After electrochemical reconstruction, both R-ZIF-CoNi and R-ZIF-CoNi(g) reveal two new peaks at 780.0 and 795.3 eV, related to the formation of Co<sup>3+</sup> species,<sup>[5a]</sup> recognized as the actual active species for electrocatalysis. Note the molar ratio of Co<sup>3+</sup>/Co<sup>2+</sup> calculated to be much higher for R-ZIF-CoNi(g) (0.71) than R-ZIF-CoNi (0.55), it is affirmative that electrochemical

reconstruction could be promoted by glassification of ZIF framework, with more abundant high oxidation state active species (Co3<sup>+</sup>) created. As noted in the N 1s XPS spectra (Figure [2b\)](#page-3-0), the XPS peak located at ≈399.7 eV, assigned to the metal-N bonds,[\[26\]](#page-8-0) is greatly weakened for both R-ZIF-CoNi and R-ZIF-CoNi(g) after surface reconstruction; especially for R-ZIF-CoNi(g), the Co–N signal is almost invisible. These observations reveal that the glassified ZIF framework with amorphous structure would be vulnerable to deep electrochemical reconstruction, as induced by the disordered Co–N bond arrangement.

To deepen the insights into the glassification promoted electrochemical reconstruction of ZIF framework, the electronic structure evolution was monitored by X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra. Co K-edge XANES spectra (Figure [2c\)](#page-3-0) illustrate that the pre-edge peak located at ≈7709 eV is broadened for ZIF-CoNi(g) as compared to ZIF-CoNi (Figure [2c,](#page-3-0) inset), suggesting the disordering of Co–N bonds after glassification. With electrochemical reconstruction happened to ZIF-CoNi and ZIF-CoNi(g), the pre-edge peak is weakened and the absorption edge is shifted to higher energy, indicating the increase in Co oxidation states for both R-ZIF-CoNi and R-ZIF-CoNi(g). The more positive shift in absorption edge could be noted for R-ZIF-CoNi(g) than R-ZIF-CoNi, implying a higher valence state of Co in glassified ZIF framework after electrochemical reconstruction. Given the linear relation between Co oxidation states and the energy at the highest first-derivative of XANES collected at Co Kedge (Figure S20, Supporting Information),[\[19a,27\]](#page-8-0) the oxidation states of Co species in R-ZIF-CoNi and R-ZIF-CoNi(g) were determined to be +2.19 and +2.42 (Figure [2d\)](#page-3-0), respectively, confirming the deeper electrochemical reconstruction with more Co<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> oxidized into Co<sup>3</sup><sup>+</sup> for R-ZIF-CoNi(g) than R-ZIF-CoNi. These results could be further supported by the change in Co coordination conditions as revealed in Fourier transformed *k*3-weighted EX-AFS spectra (Figure [2e\)](#page-3-0). Two distinct peaks are observed for ZIF-CoNi at ≈1.56 Å and ≈2.39 Å, associated with the Co–N and Co– C scattering paths, respectively.[\[28\]](#page-8-0) Then, the significant decrease in the Co–N peak and the negative shift in the Co–C peak noted for ZIF-CoNi(g) indicate its amorphization of ZIF framework as induced by glassification, which could be further confirmed by EXAFS wavelet transform (WT) (Figure S21, Supporting Information). After electrochemical reconstruction, both Co–N and Co–C peaks are weakened for further for R-ZIF-CoNi, and even could be hardly observed for R-ZIF-CoNi(g), with Co–O and Co– Co peaks instead emerging at ≈1.47 Å and ≈2.45 Å[\[27\]](#page-8-0) (Table S3, Supporting Information), respectively. It could be thus believed that the glassification of ZIF-CoNi(g) would favor the breakage of Co–N bonds in ZIF framework and thus promote its electrochemical reconstruction (Figure [2f\)](#page-3-0), with abundant CoOOH active species created to improve the electrocatalytic activity for R-ZIF-CoNi(g).

To theoretically explain the reasons for glassification promoted electrochemical reconstruction, density functional theory calculations were conducted to explore the electronic structures of ZIF-CoNi and ZIF-CoNi(g),[\[29\]](#page-8-0) with computational models constructed with ordered and disordered Co–N bonds in ZIF frameworks (Figure S22, Supporting Information) based on the above experimental observations. As revealed by the calculated projected density of states (PDOS) (**Figure 3**[a\)](#page-5-0), the Co d-band and N p-band are determined to be positively shifted by 0.09 eV and 0.04 eV, respectively, for ZIF-CoNi(g) as compared to ZIF-CoNi(g). In this case, the band center difference between N porbital and Co d-orbital turns to be obviously increased for ZIF-CoNi(g) relative to ZIF-CoNi, which suggests the weakened Co–N covalent bonding,[\[30\]](#page-8-0) being responsible to the lowered energy barrier for electrochemical reconstruction, contributing to the promoted electrochemical reconstruction of glassified ZIF framework. Then, the dynamic processes for electrochemical reconstruction happened to ZIF-CoNi and ZIF-CoNi(g) were investigated by in situ Raman spectra collected at different applied anodic potentials (Figure [3b,c\)](#page-5-0). For both ZIF-CoNi and ZIF-CoNi(g), the Raman bands located at 250–350 cm<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> should be corresponding to the stretching motion of Co–N bonds in ZIF framework.[\[31\]](#page-8-0) In comparison to ZIF-CoNi, ZIF-CoNi(g) presents much weakened Co–N Raman signals, which should be associated to the amorphization of ZIF framework after glassification. One should further note that, depending on the increasing applied anodic potentials, the Co–N Raman signals are gradually weakened for both ZIF-CoNi and ZIF-CoNi(g), and meanwhile two new Raman bands, assigned to Eg bending and A1g stretching vibrations of Co–O[\[32\]](#page-8-0) in CoOOH, appear at 468 and 581 cm<sup>−</sup>1, respectively. More importantly, with the increasing applied anodic potentials, the decrease in Co–N Raman peak intensity and the increase in Co–O Raman peak intensity are much more significant for ZIF-CoNi(g) than ZIF-CoNi, again evidencing the dynamically promoted electrochemical reconstruction induced by the glassification of ZIF framework.

Consequently, the obtained R-ZIF-CoNi and R-ZIF-CoNi(g) were recorded with in situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in 1 m KOH solution containing 10 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>3</sup> m HMF to evaluate the effect of glassification promoted electrochemical reconstruction on interfacial electrochemical behaviors for electrocatalytic HMFOR (Figure [3d,e\)](#page-5-0). For both R-ZIF-CoNi and R-ZIF-CoNi(g), depending on the increasing applied anodic potentials, the Bode plots without HMF added in electrolyte show significant transition peaks in low-frequency region (Figures S23a and S24a, Supporting Information), with complete semicircles observed for Nyquist plots (Figures S23b and S24b, Supporting Information), suggesting OER happens at the electrodes.[\[33\]](#page-8-0) With HMF added in electrolyte, an additional transition peak could be noted for both R-ZIF-CoNi and R-ZIF-CoNi(g) (Figure [3d,e\)](#page-5-0), along with a semicircular in the Nyquist plots (Figure S25, Supporting Information), confirming that HMFOR happens at electrodes by competing with OER.[\[34\]](#page-8-0) By further examining these transition peaks, both OER and HMFOR could happen at more cathodic potentials for R-ZIF-CoNi(g) (1.50 V versus RHE for OER and 1.30 V versus RHE for HMFOR), as compared to R-ZIF-CoNi (1.55 V versus RHE for OER and 1.35 V versus RHE for HMFOR), in agreement with the analysis in LSV curves. Moreover, the phase angles for HMFOR and OER are much smaller for R-ZIF-CoNi(g) than R-ZIF-CoNi at the same potential, evidencing the accelerated reaction kinetics at the R-ZIF-CoNi(g) electrode with abundant active species created during electrochemical reconstruction. The open-circuit potentials (OCPs) before and after HMF injection were further measured to evaluate the HMF adsorption capacity of different electrodes (Figure S26, Supporting Information). For the R-ZIF-CoNi and R-ZIF-CoNi(g) electrodes (Figure S26a, Supporting Information), the

OCP changes are 6–7 times that of ZIF-CoNi and ZIF-CoNi(g) (Figure S26b, Supporting Information), respectively, indicating that the HMF adsorption could be significantly promoted at the electrodes with abundant active species created by electrochemical reconstruction. Especially, the OCP change is observed to be much larger and the OCP is decreased much faster for R-ZIF-CoNi(g) than R-ZIF-CoNi with HMF injected into the electrolyte, which together suggests that the R-ZIF-CoNi(g) electrode with abundant active sites created during electrochemical reconstruction promoted by glassification would favor dynamic HMF adsorption at surface.[\[35\]](#page-8-0) These theoretical calculations and experimental analyses discover the electronic and structural fundamentals of the glassification promoted electrochemical reconstruction happened to ZIF-CoNi(g), with abundant Co active sites generated at the obtained R-ZIF-CoNi(g) electrode, promoting HMF dynamic adsorption ability and then accelerating reaction kinetics for the significantly improved HMFOR activity.

With glassification promoted electrochemical reconstruction revealed for efficient electrocatalytic HMFOR, the reaction pathways for HMFOR toward FDCA production were then illustrated for R-ZIF-CoNi(g). It has been well documented that two reaction pathways compete for HMFOR, with 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furancarboxylic acid (HMFCA) and dialdehyde furfuryl (DFF) generated as intermediates, respectively, which are subsequently oxidized to 5-formyl-2-furancarboxylic acid (FFCA) and further to FDCA as the final product,[\[12\]](#page-8-0), i.e., HMF → HMFCA → FFCA → FDCA (Path I), and HMF → DFF → FFCA → FDCA (Path II) (**Figure 4**[a\)](#page-6-0). Here, depending on the proceeding HM-FOR, HMFCA and FFCA intermediates are clearly detected, with concentrations determined to be increased and then decreased along with the consumption of HMF and the generation of FDCA, while DFF intermediates could be only detected in trace (Figure [4b](#page-6-0) and Figure S27, Supporting Information). These observations infer that the Path I is dominant for HMFOR over R-ZIFCoNi(g), which could be further theoretically evidenced by the calculated Gibbs free energy changes (Δ*G*) of each step for the two different HMFOR paths. With CoOOH-based computational models reasonably constructed for HMFOR (Figure S28, Supporting Information), a Δ*G* of 0.29 eV is required for the formation of \*HMFCA, i.e., the \*HMF → \*HMFCA step,

which is much lower than that of the \*HMF → \*DFF step (ΔG = 0.65 eV) (Figure 4c). Both experimental and calculation results confirm the HMFOR path by following HMF → HMFCA → FFCA → FDCA, and an excellent overall HMFOR performance (Figure 4d) of 100% HMF conversion, 99.6% FDCA yield, and 98.5% FDCA FE achieved over R-ZIF-CoNi(g) after the accumulated charge of ≈175.6 C in 160 min (Figure 4e). Encouragingly, the obtained R-ZIF-CoNi(g) electrode outperforms most recently reported Co-based electrocatalysts for HMFOR (Table S4, Supporting Information). During seven cycles of electrocatalytic HM-FOR at 1.48 V versus RHE (Figure 4d), HMF conversion, FDCA yield, and FDCA FE remain almost unchanged, indicating the excellent stability of R-ZIF-CoNi(g) served as electrocatalyst for HMFOR.

Given the excellent performance of R-ZIF-CoNi(g) for electrocatalytic HMFOR, a two-electrode flow membrane exchange assembly (MEA) electrolyzer (**Figure 5**[a,b\)](#page-7-0) was integrated with R-ZIF-CoNi(g) coated on CF as the anode and Pt/C sprayed on CF as the cathode (R-ZIF-CoNi(g) ‖ Pt/C) for simultaneous HMFOR and HER. As shown in Figure [5c,](#page-7-0) the cell voltage is ≈240 mV lower for HER/HMFOR than HER/OER at the current density of 100 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> (Figure S29, Supporting Information), suggesting that HER/HMFOR should be a "two birds with one stone" approach alternative to traditional HER/OER water electrocatalysis, with reduced energy consumption for hydrogen production and increased economic value gained for oxidation products. Operating at a cell voltage of 1.68 V, the R-ZIF-CoNi(g) ‖ Pt/C MEA electrolyzer exhibits excellent performance for HER/HMFOR (Figure [5d\)](#page-7-0), receiving 99.7% H2 FE for HER, and 99% HMF conversion, 96.8% FDCA yield and 91.6% FDCA FE for HMFOR after the accumulated charge of ≈470.6 C in 170 min (Figures S30 and S31, Supporting Information). Moreover, the R-ZIF-CoNi(g) ‖ Pt/C MEA electrolyzer could be stably operated for HER/HMFOR, without decay observed in after seven cycles (Figure [5e\)](#page-7-0). In short, R-ZIF-CoNi(g) acting as the anode in MEA electrolyzer owns excellent activity and stability for HMFOR, inferring its great potentials for possible industrial application.

## **3. Conclusion**

In this study, a novel ZIF-CoNi glass (ZIF-CoNi(g)) obtained by a ball-milling and melt-quenching two-step process was electrochemically treated by cyclic voltammetry. With electrochemical reconstruction promoted by the glassification of ZIF framework, the obtained electrochemically reconstructed ZIF-CoNi(g) (R-ZIF-CoNi(g)) exhibits excellent performance for HMFOR with 100% HMF conversion, 99.6% FDCA yield, and 98.5% FDCA FE at 1.48 V versus RHE. As revealed by experimental investigations and theoretical calculations, ZIF-CoNi(g) featured with disordered Co–N bond arrangement and weakened Co–N bond strength in the glassy ZIF framework is prone to the promoted electrochemical reconstruction, with abundant CoOOH active sites created to improve the dynamic HMF adsorption and accelerate the reaction kinetics for excellent HMFOR performance. It is more encouraging that the MEA assembled with R-ZIF-CoNi(g) coated on CF as the anode and Pt/C as the cathode could operate at a cell voltage of 1.68 V to reach a current density of 100 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> as high for simultaneous HMFOR and HER, with 96.8% FDCA yield, 91.6% FDCA FE, and 99.7% H2 FE. This study deepens the insights into fundamentals of glassification promoted electrochemical reconstruction and reveals the structure-activity relations of glassy MOFs for efficient electrocatalysis, which would be guidable to the rational design of glassy

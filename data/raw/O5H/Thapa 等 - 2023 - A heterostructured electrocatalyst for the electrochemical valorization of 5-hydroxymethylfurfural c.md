# A heterostructured electrocatalyst for the electrochemical valorization of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural coupled with the hydrogen evolution reaction†

Loknath Thapa, ‡ Asim Bhaumik, • Swastik Mondal • and C. Retna Raj • \*a

The selective electrocatalytic oxidative upgradation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) is a promising approach to synthesize 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA), an alternative bio-based precursor for the production of polymers. Coupling the anodic upgradation reaction with industrially important cathodic reactions such as hydrogen generation would increase the energy efficiency in electrochemical water splitting. Herein, we demonstrate the synthesis of a ternary heterostructure based on Ni<sub>x</sub>S<sub>v</sub>, MoS<sub>2</sub>, and MoC supported on onion-like carbon for anodic HMF valorization. The heterostructured electrocatalyst efficiently catalyzes the selective oxidation of HMF to FDCA with 100% faradaic efficiency (FE) and yield. The complete conversion of HMF to FDCA is achieved in 65 min. The catalytic activity is evaluated in terms of FE and rate of production of FDCA (0.463 mmol<sub>FDCA</sub> mmol<sub>HMF</sub> $^{-1}$  h $^{-1}$  cm $^{-2}$ ). The anodic valorization is achieved at 190 mV less positive potential with respect to the oxygen evolution reaction, supporting the strong electrocatalytic effect of the heterostructured catalyst. The availability of a large number of active sites due to abundant heterojunctions favors the facile electron transfer kinetics at a favorable potential. The catalyst is highly stable and reusable to deliver 100% yield even after 8 consecutive cycles without any compromise in the FE. The anodic oxidation of HMF is paired with the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction using a cathode electrocatalyst. An observable negative shift (180 mV) in the cell voltage with respect to the oxygen evolution reaction is achieved with the paired electrocatalytic system, demonstrating the excellent activity of the catalyst.

#### 1. Introduction

The rapid depletion of fossil fuels and the growing environmental pollution call for urgent attention to decrease our dependence on fossil fuel derived chemicals. The pursuit of green and sustainable chemical production demands a renewable feedstock.¹ With an annual production of over 120 billion tons of biomass, the conversion of non-edible biomass to valuable chemicals can contribute toward sustainability goals.² The oxidation of lignocellulose derived 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) has gained significant interest. FDCA serves as an important precursor for the

etc. FDCA is analogous to terephthalic acid and is widely recognized as an alternative to petroleum-derived terephthalic acid.3 Moreover, FDCA derived polyethylene 2,5-furandicarboxylate (PEF) is known to have superior physical, mechanical and thermal properties to polyethylene terephthalate (PET).¹ Thus, biomass derived FDCA has huge potential to serve as an important precursor for the synthesis of bioplastics. The traditional route for synthesis of FDCA from HMF involves the use of noble metals (Au, Pt, Pd, Ru, etc.) and hazardous chemical oxidants and it requires high temperature and elevated pressure.4-6 In recent years, the electrochemical valorization of HMF has received significant interest as it does not require precious catalysts and can be performed at room temperature and pressure. 7,8 The electrochemical HMF oxidation reaction (HMFOR) (HMF +  $2H_2O \rightarrow FDCA + 6H^+ + 6e^-$ ,  $E^O = 0.3 \text{ V } \nu s$ . RHE) is a promising and green route for the upgradation of HMF to FDCA which occurs under much milder conditions driven by the applied potential. Moreover, the anodic HMFOR can be coupled with reduction half-reactions, such as the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), N2 reduction reaction (NRR), CO2 reduction reaction, etc. at the cathode to generate

synthesis of a wide range of products such as polymers, drugs,

HMF oxidation to FDCA follows two pathways depending on the pH of the electrolyte. In strongly alkaline solution (pH > 13), the oxidation involves the formation of 5-hydroxymethyl-2furancarboxylic acid (HMFCA) whereas it involves formation of 2,5-diformylfuran (DFF) at pH ≤ 13.16 Both DFF and HMFCA are further oxidized to 5-formyl-2-furancarboxylic acid (FFCA) and finally to FDCA. The major concern with the electrochemical HMFOR in an alkaline medium is that it seriously suffers from the competitive oxygen evolution reaction (OER)  $(4OH^{-} \rightarrow O_{2} + 2H_{2}O + 4e^{-}, E^{O} = 1.23 \text{ V vs. RHE})$ , compromising the FE due to large overpotential. Thus, there should be a sufficient potential gap between the HMFOR and OER for selective HMFOR. The selective oxidation of HMF at low overpotential requires an efficient electrocatalyst. The efficiency of the HMFOR can be evaluated by calculating the FDCA yield and FE. Several attempts have been made to rationally design and develop electrocatalysts to selectively oxidize HMF to FDCA. A wide range of electrocatalysts including noble metal nanoparticles and transition metal (Fe, Ni, Cu, Co, etc.) hydroxides, oxides, phosphides, sulfides, etc. have been explored in the recent past.17-23 Among various electrocatalysts, transition metal sulfides stand out for the HMFOR. The nickel sulfide-based catalyst attracted much attention though the reaction kinetics is rather slow. The development of heterostructured catalytic platforms made of two or more electrocatalysts with nickel sulfide is expected to enhance the FDCA yield and FE. Heterostructured catalytic platforms are known to have exceptional activity compared to their individual components due to the synergistic effect, enhanced electrical conductivity, and multiple active sites.24

Existing studies show that in situ generated M-OOH over the surface of transition metal sulfides/oxides during the anodic potential sweep actually catalyzes the HMFOR. The stabilization of the in situ generated catalyst is essential to achieve stable catalytic performance for extended periods of time or during repeated cycles. The catalyst support plays a crucial role in electrocatalysis and offers a stable platform for the uniform dispersion of the catalyst and control of unwanted aggregation of the catalyst. The catalyst-support interaction often provides additional catalytic features for the catalyst. Herein, we demonstrate the electrocatalytic performance of a ternary heterostructured electrocatalyst made of Ni/Mo sulfides and MoC supported on onion-like carbon (OLC). A heterostructured electrocatalyst with abundant heterointerfaces can have numerous defect rich sites with a tuned electronic structure that facilitates electron transfer for oxidation of HMF to FDCA. The heterostructured electrocatalyst delivers a current density of 50  $\rm mA~cm^{-2}$  at 1.4 V vs. RHE in 10 mM HMF which is 190 mV lower than that of the OER. An FE of 100% is achieved at a potential of 1.4 V and the catalyst is highly recyclable for at least 8 cycles without any compromise in the FE. A paired electrochemical system is designed for the production of FDCA at the anode and hydrogen gas at the cathode.

## **Experimental section**

#### Materials and reagents

Nickel chloride (NiCl<sub>2</sub>·6H<sub>2</sub>O), potassium hydroxide (KOH), sodium molybdate (Na<sub>2</sub>MoO<sub>4</sub>·2H<sub>2</sub>O), and thiourea (CH<sub>4</sub>N<sub>2</sub>S) were purchased from Merck Pvt. Ltd. Pluronic P-123, 5hydroxymethylfurfural and ammonium formate (NH4HCO2) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. 2,5-Furandicarboxylic acid, 5-formyl-2-furancarboxylic acid, 2,5-furandicarboxaldehyde, 5hydroxymethyl-2-furancarboxylic acid, and melamine were obtained from Tokyo Chemicals (India) Pvt. Ltd. Nickel foam was purchased from Hi-Tech Scientific Equipment Co. Ltd. (India). Millipore water (Milli-Q system) was used for all experiments.

#### 2.2 Synthesis of the ternary heterostructured electrocatalyst

2.2.1 Synthesis of the NiMoO<sub>4</sub> precursor. The NiMoO<sub>4</sub> precursor was synthesized via the hydrothermal route. Briefly, Na<sub>2</sub>MoO<sub>4</sub>·2H<sub>2</sub>O (0.96 g), NiCl<sub>2</sub>·6H<sub>2</sub>O, (1.9 g), and Pluronic P-123 (1 g) were dissolved in 60 mL water and stirred for 1 h. The mixture was then transferred to a 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and heated to 120 °C for 6 h. The product was collected by vacuum filtration followed by washing several times with water and finally with ethanol. It was then allowed to dry overnight in a vacuum oven.

2.2.2 Synthesis of the Ni<sub>x</sub>S<sub>y</sub>/MoS<sub>2</sub>/MoC heterostructure. NiMoO<sub>4</sub> (100 mg) was mixed with a required amount of C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>6</sub>H<sub>6</sub> (250 mg) and CH<sub>4</sub>N<sub>2</sub>S (250 mg) in a mortar and pestle. The homogeneous mixture was then annealed at 750 °C for 1 h under an Ar atmosphere at 5 °C min<sup>-1</sup>. For control experiments, Ni<sub>9</sub>S<sub>8</sub>, MoS<sub>2</sub> and MoC were synthesized and characterized (ESI†). The binary catalysts (MoS<sub>2</sub>/Ni<sub>9</sub>S<sub>8</sub> and MoC/Ni<sub>9</sub>S<sub>8</sub>) were obtained by the homogenous mixing of individual components by ultrasonication for 1 h.

#### 2.3 Instrumentation

The X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was performed with a Bruker D8 advance unit using Cu-K $\alpha$  ( $\lambda = 1.54$  Å). The morphology and elemental mapping analysis of the samples was performed using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) (Carl ZEISS-Merlin) analysis. Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis was performed using Quantachrome® ASiQwin™. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high resolution-TEM analysis was performed using a JEOL JEM 2100 HR (80-200 kV). A PHI 5000 Versa Probe III was used for X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.

#### 2.4 Electrochemical measurements

All electrochemical experiments were performed in a threeelectrode cell configuration using a two compartment H-type cell separated by a Nafion 211 membrane. A CHI643B (CH Instruments, USA) electrochemical analyzer was used. The catalyst coated nickel foam working, graphite rod (5 mm) counter, and Hg/HgO (1 M NaOH) reference electrodes were used. All potentials are referred to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) ( $E_{\text{RHE}} = E_{\text{Hg/HgO}} + 0.098 \text{ V} + 0.0591 \text{ pH}$ ). The

required amount of the catalyst (4 mg) was ultrasonically dispersed in a 250  $\mu$ L of 2-propanol, water and nafion (5%) (15:8:2) mixture for 1 h. It was then drop cast onto 2  $\times$  1 cm² nickel foam and dried overnight in a vacuum oven. The electrolyte was purged with Ar for 20 min prior to electrochemical analysis. KOH (1 M, pH = 14) was used as electrolyte in all experiments. For the full cell fabrication, Ni<sub>x</sub>S<sub>y</sub>/MoS<sub>2</sub>/MoC and FeP@NPC (nitrogen and phosphorus dual-doped mesoporous carbonencapsulated iron phosphide) modified onto Ni-foam were used as the anode and cathode, respectively, in an undivided cell with 40 mL (1 M KOH). All other conditions were the same as those for the 3-electrode system.

#### 2.5 HMF and its oxidation product analysis

High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (Thermo Fisher Scientific Vanquish™ Core HPLC system) equipped with an ultraviolet-visible detector set at 265 nm and a 4.6 mm imes250 mm VC-C10-A column was used to monitor the concentration of HMF and its oxidation products. The mobile phase was a mixture of 5 mM HCO<sub>2</sub>NH<sub>4</sub> and methanol (1.4 mL min<sup>-1</sup>). During a run time of 10 min, the methanol fraction was gradually increased from 0 to 20% and the column temperature was maintained at 40 °C throughout the HPLC analysis. For each run, an aliquot of 10  $\mu L$  was extracted from the anodic compartment of the cell and diluted to 500 µL with Milli-Q water. The mixture was then passed through a 0.2 µm PTFE membrane prior to its injection (20 µL) into the instrument for HPLC analysis. Calibration curves were made to quantify HMF and its electrochemically oxidized products (Fig. S1 and S2†). HMF conversion, FDCA yield and FE were calculated according to the following equations:

HMF conversion (%) = 
$$\left(1 - \frac{\text{moles of HMF remaining}}{\text{moles of HMF initially loaded}}\right)$$
  
× 100

FDCA yield (%) = 
$$\frac{\text{moles of FDCA formed}}{\text{moles of HMF initially loaded}} \times 100$$

FE (%) = 
$$\frac{\text{moles of FDCA formed } \times 6 \times F}{\text{total charge passed}} \times 100$$

#### 3. Results and discussion

#### 3.1 Synthesis and characterization

The synthesis of the  $Ni_xS_y/MoS_2/MoC$  heterostructure involves two steps: (i) hydrothermal precipitation of  $NiMoO_4$  using  $Na_2MoO_4$ ,  $NiCl_2$ , and P123 and (ii) thermal annealing of the  $NiMoO_4$  precursor in the presence of melamine and thiourea. In the hydrothermal step, P123 controls the growth of  $NiMoO_4$  with desired morphology. In the subsequent annealing step, the *in situ* generated  $H_2S/CS_2$  by the decomposition of thiourea sulfidates Ni and Mo and yields  $Ni_xS_y$  and  $MoS_2$ ; the thermal

decomposition of melamine affords nitrogen doped OLC. The PXRD analysis of the heterostructure reveals the growth of Ni<sub>x</sub>S<sub>v</sub>, MoS<sub>2</sub>, and MoC. The diffraction profile is indexed to Ni<sub>9</sub>S<sub>8</sub> (04-007-0778), Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub> (04-007-5742), MoS<sub>2</sub> (00-37-1492), and MoC (01-085-8565) (Fig. 1a). The careful examination of the profile shows that the diffraction intensity corresponding to the (002) plane of MoS2 is significantly compromised most likely due to poor stacking of MoS<sub>2</sub> nanosheets<sup>25-27</sup> or due to the presence of defects. Broadening of the diffraction suggests the presence of defects and small crystallites.28 The growth of the heterostructure was further authenticated by XRD refinement (Fig. S3†). The surface morphology of NiMoO<sub>4</sub> and the heterostructured catalyst was examined by FESEM. The precursor NiMoO<sub>4</sub> has nano-wire bundle-like morphology with a diameter of  $\sim$ 200 nm and length of >2  $\mu$ m (Fig. S4†). The thermal sulfidation completely transforms the nanowire morphology into a quasi-spherical nanostructure (Fig. 1b). SEM-EDX elemental mapping shows the uniform distribution of Ni, Mo, S, C, and N throughout the catalyst (Fig. 1c). The Ni<sub>9</sub>S<sub>8</sub> synthesized for control experiments shows characteristic diffraction (04-007-0778) (Fig. S5a†) and FESEM image shows particles of about 500 nm and growth of a tubular carbon structure (Fig. S5b and c†). The Mo-based control samples (MoS<sub>2</sub> and MoC) were also synthesized under similar conditions. MoS2 shows characteristic diffraction (04-025-2557) and the FESEM image shows nano-sheet like morphology (Fig. S6a-c†). The XRD profile of MoC shows characteristic diffraction peaks (00-006-0546) and ill-defined morphology (Fig. S7a-c†). The TEM analysis of the ternary heterostructured electrocatalyst shows that the metal sulfide nanoparticles are supported on carbon (Fig. S8a†). Careful examination of the HR-TEM image shows the growth of the Ni<sub>x</sub>S<sub>y</sub>/MoS<sub>2</sub>/MoC heterostructure over OLC (Fig. 2a). OLC has a fringe spacing of 0.37 nm corresponding to the (002) plane of carbon. The MoS2 nanosheets are poorly stacked and Ni9S8 forms a heterointerface with MoS2 (Fig. 2b). The HRTEM and inverse FFT analyses further demonstrate that the MoS2 sheets are poorly stacked and enriched with defects such as dislocation (Fig. S8b†). The fringes of 0.63 nm and 0.57 nm correspond to the (002) and (111) planes of MoS<sub>2</sub> and Ni<sub>9</sub>S<sub>8</sub>, confirming the formation of a heterointerface. Moreover, the fringes of 0.27 and 0.25 nm correspond to MoS<sub>2</sub> (100) and MoC (100) phases, respectively, supporting the growth of the heterointerface (Fig. 2c). Such formation of heterointerfaces assures the availability of a large number of catalytically active sites for efficient binding of the substrate for promoted electrocatalytic reactions. A closer look at the HRTEM analysis reveals that the heterointerface is largely dominated by Ni<sub>9</sub>S<sub>8</sub> and MoS<sub>2</sub>.

The chemical nature of the heterostructure was examined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic (XPS) analysis. The surface survey scan shows the presence of C, N, O, S, Mo, and Ni (Fig. S9a†). The deconvoluted Mo 3d spectra show peaks at 229.2 and 232.4 eV of  $\mathrm{Mo^{2^+}}$  and 229.6 and 232.8 eV of  $\mathrm{Mo^{4^+}}$  of  $\mathrm{3d_{5/2}}$  and  $\mathrm{3d_{3/2}}$ , respectively (Fig. 3a). The peaks at 232.7 and 235.7 eV corresponding to  $\mathrm{3d_{5/2}}$  and  $\mathrm{3d_{3/2}}$  confirm the presence of high valent  $\mathrm{Mo(v1)}$ . The Ni 2p spectra were deconvoluted into two spin–orbit coupled doublets corresponding to Ni 2p<sub>3/2</sub> and Ni 2p<sub>1/2</sub> and two shakeup satellites (Fig. 3b). The careful

observation of high-resolution Ni  $2p_{3/2}$  and Ni  $2p_{1/2}$  spectra shows peaks at 855.2 and 856.8 eV for  $\mathrm{Ni}^{2^{+}}$  and  $\mathrm{Ni}^{3^{+}}$  of Ni  $2p_{3/2}$ and 872.6 and 875.7 eV for  $Ni^{2+}$  and  $Ni^{3+}$  of Ni  $2p_{1/2}$ , respectively. The presence of Ni<sup>3+</sup> and Mo<sup>2+</sup> species suggests strong electronic interaction by charge transfer from Ni to Mo. The deconvoluted S 2p spectra show the S  $2p_{3/2}$  and  $2p_{1/2}$  at 162.1 eV and 163.3 eV, respectively (Fig. 3c). The peak at higher binding energy corresponds to the oxidized sulfur species.

profile, the peak at 284.8 eV corresponds to the sp²-hybridized graphitic carbon whereas the peak at 286.2 and 288.8 eV corresponds to the C-N bond and O-C=O bond (Fig. 3d). The deconvoluted N 1s spectra show characteristic peaks at 398.9, 400.8 and 401.3 eV corresponding to pyridinic-N (92%), pyrrolic-N (2%), and graphitic-N (6%), respectively (Fig. S9b†). The pore size, pore volume, and specific surface area were obtained from Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis (Fig. S10†) using the nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherm. The electrocatalyst was found to have a specific surface area of 28.496 m² g $^{-1}$  with a pore-size of 11.87 nm and pore-volume of 0.1692 cm³ g $^{-1}$ .

#### 3.2 Electrocatalytic valorization of HMF

The electrochemically active surface area of the heterostructured and  $\rm Ni_9S_8$  catalysts was estimated using cyclic voltammetry from the double capacitance ( $C_{\rm dl}$ ) in the non-faradic potential region according to the established procedures (Fig. S11†).<sup>29</sup> The  $C_{\rm dl}$  was calculated to be 3.9 and 1.8 mF cm<sup>-2</sup> for the heterostructured and  $\rm Ni_9S_8$  catalysts, respectively, suggesting that the former catalyst has a significantly large surface area. The electrochemical HMFOR was evaluated in a 3-

electrode H-type cell with each compartment loaded with 20 mL, 1 M KOH, and separated by a Nafion-211 membrane (Fig. S12†). The linear sweep voltammogram (LSV) in the absence of HMF shows a characteristic peak at 1.42 V corresponding to the reaction of  $Ni^{2+} \rightarrow Ni^{3+}$  (Fig. 4a). It is well established that transition metal sulfides/phosphides/selenides (S<sup>2-</sup>, Se<sup>2-</sup>, P<sup>2-</sup>, etc.) undergo surface reconstruction to M-OOH at high potential in an alkaline medium.30-33 In our case, the ternary heterostructure undergoes surface reconstruction during the positive potential sweep and produces NiOOH species. The surface coverage  $(\Gamma)$  of the catalytically active sites of the heterostructured catalyst was estimated to be 7.74  $\times$ 10<sup>-6</sup> mol cm<sup>-2</sup> by integrating the area under LSV after subtracting the background current (Fig. S13a†). In the case of  $Ni_9S_8$ ,  $\Gamma$  was estimated to be  $1.52 \times 10^{-6}$  mol cm<sup>-2</sup> (Fig. S13b†) which is >5 times lower than that of the heterostructured catalyst, highlighting the availability of a large number of active sites in the heterostructured catalyst. The surface coverage of the binary catalysts MoS<sub>2</sub>/Ni<sub>9</sub>S<sub>8</sub> and MoC/Ni<sub>9</sub>S<sub>8</sub> was calculated to be  $0.94 \times 10^{-6}$  and  $0.83 \times 10^{-6}$  mol cm<sup>-2</sup> (Fig. S13c and d†) which is significantly low compared to that of the ternary

heterostructured catalyst. The heterointerfaces expose sufficient active sites for the facile access of the electrolyte and substrate. The increase in the anodic current density at high positive potential (>1.55 V) corresponds to the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). A current density of 50 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> for the OER is achieved at a potential of 1.59 V. However, on addition of HMF (10 mM), significant enhancement in the current density was observed (Fig. 4a) due to the facile oxidation of HMF. More importantly, 50 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> is achieved at a potential of 1.40 V, which is 190 mV less positive than that of the OER, indicating that the HMFOR is highly favored over the OER. The onset potential for the HMFOR is ~1.35 V which is 170 mV less positive than that of the OER, further supporting that the HMFOR is thermodynamically more favorable than the OER. It is worth mentioning here that 50 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> is achieved at 1.36 V when the voltammogram is corrected for iR, further highlighting the high activity of the ternary catalyst (Fig. S14†). The electrocatalytic reaction involves the in situ electrochemical

generation of NiOOH (vide supra) and the chemical oxidation of HMF to FDCA by NiOOH (Scheme 1). The Ni<sup>2+</sup> generated by the chemical reaction is further electrochemically converted to Ni<sup>3+</sup> for the further oxidation of HMF. The catalytic cycle continues until all the HMF is oxidized to FDCA.

The HMFOR was also performed with Ni<sub>9</sub>S<sub>8</sub>, MoS<sub>2</sub>, MoC, and the binary (MoS<sub>2</sub>/Ni<sub>9</sub>S<sub>8</sub> and MoC/Ni<sub>9</sub>S<sub>8</sub>) catalysts to understand the role of heterointerfaces of the ternary catalyst (Fig. 4b). The Ni<sub>9</sub>S<sub>8</sub> catalyst failed to reach a current density of 50 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> at 1.4 V and could achieve only 30.5 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> for the oxidation of HMF (10 mM) (Fig. 4b and S15†). The performance of MoS<sub>2</sub>, MoC, and the binary catalysts is inferior to that of the ternary and Ni<sub>9</sub>S<sub>8</sub> catalysts (Fig. 4b and S16†). The Tafel analysis was performed for the HMFOR and OER (absence of HMF) with the heterostructured catalyst (Fig. S17a†) and the Tafel slope was calculated to be 35.7 and 190 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>, respectively, indicating the facile electron transfer kinetics for HMF oxidation. The Tafel slope with Ni<sub>9</sub>S<sub>8</sub> was calculated to be 44.4 mV dec<sup>-1</sup> (10 mM HMF) (Fig. S17b†). It may be noted here that unmodified nickel foam does not favor HMF oxidation due to very sluggish electron transfer kinetics (Fig. 4b).

Constant potential electrolysis was performed to quantitatively study the electrochemical oxidation of HMF at a potential of 1.4 V. In the case of the heterostructured catalyst, a theoretically required charge of 115.8 C (20 mL of 10 mM HMF solution) was passed in  $\sim$ 65 min (Fig. 5a). The close examination of the coulometric profile shows that 100 C was consumed in ~20 min, indicating the very fast charge transfer and rapid conversion of HMF to FDCA. The decrease in the concentration of HMF and increase in the concentration FDCA during electrolysis were monitored with HPLC. Analysis of the aliquots extracted from the electrochemical cell at different intervals shows a gradual decrease in the intensity of the HMF signal with a concomitant increase of the FDCA signal (Fig. 5b). The chromatograms obtained at intermediate stages of electrolysis (30, 60 and 90 C) show signals corresponding to HMFCA and

FFCA with no signal for DFF suggesting that the HMFOR proceeds by the HMFCA pathway.16 At 115.8 C, the signal for HMF and other intermediates completely disappeared while the signal for FDCA increased to maximum indicating 100% conversion of HMF to FDCA achieving  $\sim$ 100% FE. It should be highlighted here that the complete conversion of HMF to FDCA is achieved in 65 min implying that the rate of conversion is significantly fast (Table S2†). Fig. 5c shows the change in the concentration of HMF and its oxidation products during electrolysis. The digital photographs (Fig. 5d) taken before and after electrolysis show the visible color change. The <sup>1</sup>H-NMR spectral profile of the precipitate obtained (after acidification) from the anodic compartment showed a signal corresponding to FDCA with no other impurity peak confirming the complete conversion of HMF to FDCA (Fig. S18†). To study the interference from the competitive OER, constant potential electrolysis was performed at 1.45 and 1.5 V in the presence of 10 mM of HMF. The electrolysis at 1.45 V was completed within 68 min with ~98% FE (Fig. S19a-c†). On the other hand, at 1.5 V, the theoretical charge (115.8 C) required for the complete conversion of HMF to FDCA was passed in  $\sim$ 40 min (Fig. S19d†). However, only 92% yield of FDCA was recorded. The complete conversion of HMF could not be achieved and the HPLC chromatogram at 115.8 C shows peaks of HMF and its intermediates (Fig. S19e and f†). To

further highlight the electrocatalytic performance of the heterostructured catalyst, the HMFOR was also examined with Ni<sub>9</sub>S<sub>8</sub> by constant potential electrolysis under identical conditions. In contrast to the heterostructured catalysts, at 1.4 V, it took >3 h to pass the theoretical charge required for the complete conversion (Fig. S20a, d and g†) and only 67 C was transferred in 1 h, supporting the superior performance of the heterostructured catalyst. Moreover, the time required for the complete conversion of HMF even at 1.45 V is higher than that by the heterostructured catalyst (Fig. S20b, e and h†). At 1.5 V, the FE dropped to 90% due to the interference from the OER (Fig. S20c, f and i†). These results unambiguously indicate the outstanding performance of the heterostructured catalyst.

The reusability of the catalyst was tested by subjecting the same electrode to repeated measurements. HMF (10 mM) was consecutively added to the electrochemical cell and the required charge was passed after each addition for its complete conversion to FDCA (Fig. S21a†). The product was analyzed after passing the required charge in each cycle and the FE was calculated. As shown in Fig. 6a, ~100% FE was almost maintained in all 8 cycles without any compromise in the selectivity, demonstrating excellent reusability and stability. The stability of the catalyst during repeated use was further evaluated by recording the voltammogram before and after 8 consecutive i-t

experiments. A characteristic voltammetric signature for the catalytic reaction was observed though a slight shift in the potential and small decrease in the current were noticed (Fig. S21b†). It is reasonable to observe such a shift in the potential as the experiment was performed without changing the electrolyte. The time required for the complete conversion in the last few cycles is  $\sim$ 75 min which is  $\sim$ 10 min more than that in the initial cycles (Fig. S21a†).

The post-consecutive HMFOR XRD analysis of the catalyst does not show any characteristic diffraction suggesting the amorphization of the electrocatalyst (Fig. S22a†). The EDX elemental mapping analysis shows the uniform distribution of Ni, Mo, C, N, S, and O (Fig. S22b and c†). The post-catalytic TEM image further supports the amorphization of the catalyst during electrocatalysis (Fig. S22d†). The EDX spectra recorded after catalytic cycles witness an increase in the atomic% of oxygen due to in situ surface reconstruction (Fig. S22e and f†). Post-HMFOR XPS analysis of the electrocatalyst also shows the signature of Ni, Mo, O, and S though a significant decrease in the intensity of Mo and S was noticed (Fig. S23 and Table S1†). The O 1s signal significantly increased. Theoretically, NiOOH has stronger adsorption for HMF (-1.81 eV) than OH $^-$  (-1.4 eV)and  $H_2O(-0.83 \text{ eV})$ , indicating strong interaction between HMF and NiOOH.33 The in situ generated NiOOH is the active species while the lattice oxygen or adsorbed oxygen is the active site which cleaves the C-H/O-H bonds by harvesting electrons in the nucleophile.34 In a nutshell, the electrochemically generated surface NiOOH chemically oxidizes HMF to FDCA (through the non-electrochemical pathway) while itself getting reduced to Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>. At high oxidation potential, Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> is further oxidized to NiOOH (through the electrochemical pathway), thus forming a catalytic cycle where electrochemically generated NiOOH chemically oxidizes HMF to FDCA by the indirect oxidation pathway.

Traditionally, the electrochemical performance of the catalyst towards the HMFOR is evaluated in terms of (i) HMF conversion (eqn (1)), (ii) FDCA yield (eqn (2)), and (iii) FE (eqn (3)). Most of the existing literature reports HMF conversion  $\sim$ 100%, with FDCA yield and FE  $\sim$ 95–99% (Table S2†), and thus creates a state of confusion among readers while comparing the performance of various catalysts. It may also be noted that the electrode area in the range of 0.2 to 4 cm2 and HMF concentrations varying from 5 to 100 mM have been used. The electrolysis time, surface area, and initial concentration of HMF are not considered while describing the activity. Although a couple of reports describe the activity in terms of FDCA yield per unit time  $(g h^{-1})^{35}$  and conversion of HMF per unit time, <sup>36</sup> it would be more appropriate to describe the activity in terms of a single parameter, the rate of production of FDCA, taking (a) total electrolysis time, (b) the initial concentration of HMF, and (c) surface area of the electrode into consideration as shown in eqn (4).

Rate of FDCA production 
$$= \frac{\text{mmol}_{\text{FDCA}}}{\text{mmol}_{\text{HMF}} \times A \times t}$$
 (4)  
where  $\text{mmol}_{\text{FDCA}} = \frac{\text{FDCA}_{\text{yield}} \times \text{mmol}_{\text{HMF}}}{100}$ ,  $A$  is the surface

area of the electrode, and t is the electrolysis time (h). Such a procedure is well adopted in the case of electrochemical synthesis of ammonia from nitrogen or nitrate, urea from nitrogen and carbon dioxide, etc.37 In our case, the rate of production of FDCA was calculated to be 0.463 mmol<sub>FDCA</sub>  $\text{mmol}_{\text{HMF}}^{-1} \text{ h}^{-1} \text{ cm}^{-2}$  according to eqn (4). This is significantly higher than that by most of the existing catalysts and compares well with that by some of the catalysts, highlighting the high catalytic activity of our heterostructured catalyst. The rate of production of FDCA at other potentials of 1.45 and 1.5 V was calculated to be 0.866 and 1.40 mmol<sub>FDCA</sub> mmol<sub>HMF</sub><sup>-1</sup> h<sup>-1</sup> cm<sup>-2</sup>. Though the rate of the reaction significantly increases while moving to high positive potential, the FE significantly drops to 92%. It is suggested that the rate of production of FDCA should be calculated by considering the initial concentration of HMF, electrolysis time, and area of the electrode at a potential where 100% FE is achieved.

#### 3.3 Paired electrocatalysis

Coupling the anodic reaction with a suitable cathodic reaction to develop a full cell is a promising approach to increase the overall energy efficiency. Encouraged by the outstanding activity of the

heterostructured catalyst towards valorization of HMF, the anode half-cell reaction is coupled with the HER to develop a full cell (Fig. S24†). The iron phosphide-based catalyst (FeP@NPC)30 developed in our lab was used as a cathode catalyst. As shown in Fig. 7a, a current density of 50 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> was achieved at a cell voltage of 1.8 V for overall water splitting. However, on addition of HMF (10 mM), the same current density was achieved at 1.62 V which is 180 mV lower than overall water splitting voltage, demonstrating that coupling the anode reaction indeed increases the energy efficiency of the full cell. Current densities of 10, 25, 50 and 100 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> were achieved at much lower cell voltage in the presence of HMF (Fig. 7a (inset)). A benchmark current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> is achieved at a cell voltage of 1.5 V. Long-term electrolysis was performed at 1.6 V and the electrochemically generated H<sub>2</sub> was collected by the water drainage method. Fig. 7b shows the comparison of measured and theoretically calculated H<sub>2</sub> during the full cell electrolysis at 1.6 V. As can be readily seen, the FE for the HER is 94% with a hydrogen generation rate of 0.22 mmol h<sup>-1</sup>. It may be noted here that paired electrolysis can also be performed at a less positive potential of 1.5 V (10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>). HPLC analysis of the aliquots from the cell shows ~98% FE for FDCA production. The single compartment full cell of the HMFOR coupled HER demonstrates several advantages such as higher energy efficiency, coproduction of valuable chemicals, and membrane free electrolysis.38

#### 4. Conclusion

An electrocatalytically active ternary heterostructure based on  $Ni_xS_y$ ,  $MoS_2$ , and MoC is synthesized and the electrocatalytic valorization of HMF is demonstrated. The electrocatalyst with abundant heterointerfaces provides numerous catalytically active sites with a tuned electronic structure that facilitates efficient binding and electron transfer for oxidation of HMF to FDCA. It shows superior electrocatalytic performance and 100% conversion was achieved in  $\sim$ 65 min at 1.4 V. The catalyst is highly selective towards FDCA and has excellent stability and

retained its superior catalytic performance with  ${\sim}100\%$  FE and selectivity even after 8 consecutive cycles. The high stability is accounted for by the presence of OLC in the heterostructured electrocatalyst. The anodic valorization of HMF is coupled with the cathodic evolution of hydrogen. A significant decrease in the cell voltage with respect to the oxygen evolution reaction is achieved, implying improved overall energy efficiency. This work demonstrates that the heterostructured electrocatalyst based on nickel sulfide is very promising for electrocatalytic valorization for the generation of value-added products.

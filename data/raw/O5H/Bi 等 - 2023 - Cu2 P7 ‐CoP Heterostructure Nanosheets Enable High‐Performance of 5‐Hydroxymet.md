**Abstract:** Electrooxidation of 5-hydroxymethylfural (HMF) into 2,5-furandicarboxylicacid (FDCA) has been regarded as a promising sustainable approach to achieve value-added chemicals. However, it is still impeded by the unsatisfactory performance of electrocatalysts. Here, Cu2P7-CoP heterostructure nanosheets were reported to enable powerful HMF electrooxidation. The Cu2P7-CoP heterostructure nanosheets were fabricated by microwave-assisted deep eutectic solvent (DES) approach, along with subsequent phosphiding. The Cu2P7-CoP heterostructure nanosheets enabled a superb 100% HMF conversion at 1.43 V (vs. RHE) with 98.8% FDCA yield and 98% Faradaic efficiency (FE), demonstrating its promising application in HMF electrooxidation. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis, open-circuit potential (OCP) approach and density functional theory (DFT) calculation uncovered that the electron transfer and redistribution between Cu2P7 and CoP improved the adsorption capacity of HMF and modulated the catalytic performance. This study not only offered a powerful electrocatalyst for HMF electrooxidation, but also provided a conceptually new strategy for the heterostructure catalyst design.

## **Introduction**

With rapid development of economy, human demand for fossil energy is increasing day by day, which needs to be solved urgently.[1] The efficient and rational utilization of biomass energy is expected to be a promising way to solve this issue.[2] Renewable lignocellulosic biomass is an ideal substitute for petrochemical products.[3,4] Among others, the lignocellulose biomass-derived 5-hydroxymethylfural (HMF) is a valuable bio-based C6 platform molecule, which has attracted more and more attention.[5] HMF can be oxidized to various organic substances, among which 2,5-furandicarboxylicacid (FDCA) has a broad application prospect.[6,7] FDCA is listed by the U.S. Department of Energy as the important compound for the establishment of green chemical industry in the future. Particularly, FDCA is an important precursor for producing bio-polymers (polyethylene furandicarboxylate: PEF). Therefore, it is of great significance to develop efficient catalyst that enables powerful performance to convert HMF into FDCA.

The conventional HMF oxidation approach is mainly based on thermal catalysis, which is not in line with the pressure and noble metals are usually involved.[8] In contrast, electrochemical oxidation approach can be performed at room temperature and ambient pressure without additional oxidant, which is an environmentally friendly and lowenergy-consuming method.[9–11] More importantly, the cost of HMF conversion can be reduced by replacing noble metal catalysts with earth-abundant metal-based catalysts in electrochemical oxidation approach.[12] In addition, utilizing HMF electrooxidation reaction as a substitute for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in electrolyzed water anode allows for simultaneous production of high-value products from both the anode (FDCA) and cathode (H2), while also reducing the overall potential of electrolyzed water.[13–15] However, the industrial application of HMF electrooxidation is still hindered by the unsatisfactory performance of electrocatalysts. Therefore, it is urgent to develop non-noble metal electrocatalysts with high selectivity and strong stability.

Heterostructure engineering has received increasing attention in the electrocatalyst design since it enables versatile modulation of electronic feature of the active centers in catalyst for improving the intrinsic electroactivity.[16–19] Moreover, the selective construction of heterostructure can maximize the synergistic effect of different components, which has a broad application prospect in the field of advanced electrocatalysis.[20,21] According to previous study, two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterial catalysts can be synthesized by the structure-directing functions of deep eutectic solvents (DES).[22] Two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials have the unique advantages of large specific surface area, highly exposed catalytic active center and larger contact area with electrolyte, enabling an enhanced electrocatalytic performance in electrochemical process.[23] There-

fore, we suppose that it is of great interest to integrate advantages of heterostructure and 2D structure into single catalyst for HMF electrooxidation.

Cobalt phosphide catalysts (Co-P, [24] Ce-CoP[25] and CoP-CoOOH<sup>[26]</sup>) have been reported for the HMF electrooxidation, demonstrating their promising application potential.[27] However, their intrinsic electroactivity for HMF conversion is still unsatisfactory. Recently, Cu-based materials have gradually attracted attention in HMF electrooxidation because their activity to water oxidation (competitive reaction of HMF oxidation) is usually lower than that of Ni/Co-based materials. [28,29] Until now, there is still a lack of reports on the reasonable combination of Co-based and Cu-based materials to give full play in achieving high-performance electrooxidation of HMF.

Herein, we designed Cu<sub>2</sub>P<sub>7</sub>-CoP heterostructure nanosheets as the electrocatalyst for electrooxidation of HMF into FDCA. The Cu<sub>2</sub>P<sub>7</sub>-CoP nanosheets with heterostructure were achieved from microwave-assisted DES approach, along with subsequent phosphiding. The designed Cu<sub>2</sub>P<sub>7</sub>-CoP electrocatalyst demonstrated outstanding electrooxidation performance, with 100% HMF conversion, 98.8% FDCA yield and 98% Faradaic efficiency (FE) at 1.43 V (versus reversible hydrogel electrode, RHE). The enhanced electrooxidation performance of Cu<sub>2</sub>P<sub>7</sub>-CoP electrocatalyst was unveiled by XPS, open-circuit potential (OCP) method and density functional theory (DFT) calculation. The present work offered a conceptually new DES-based approach for the design of high-performance heterostructure electrocatalyst in HMF electrooxidation.

## **Results and Discussion**

The Cu<sub>2</sub>P<sub>7</sub>-CoP heterostructure nanosheets were prepared via a microwave-assisted choline chloride/oxalic acid (ChCl/OA) DES approach, along with phosphiding process (Figure 1). Firstly, Cu/Co-based precursors were synthesized after micro-

wave heating the DES containing Cu/Co salts. The Cu/Cobased precursors were finally transformed into Cu<sub>2</sub>P<sub>7</sub>-CoP heterostructure nanosheets after calcination with NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>2</sub> as phosphorus source in N<sub>2</sub> atmosphere. The final products with different proportions of initial feeding Cu and Co sources were marked as Cu<sub>2</sub>P<sub>7</sub>-CoP (x:y), where x: y represented the initial feeding atomic ratio of Cu/Co. For comparison, the Cu<sub>2</sub>P<sub>7</sub>-CoP (1: 4, 1:5, 1:6), copper phosphide and cobalt phosphide were all synthesized.

The crystal phase of the as-obtained products was determined via X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis (Figure 2a and Figure S1-S2). The diffraction peaks of cobalt phosphide product could be attributed to crystalline CoP (JCPDS No. 29-0497). The diffraction peaks of Cu<sub>2</sub>P<sub>7</sub>-CoP (1:4), Cu<sub>2</sub>P<sub>7</sub>-CoP (1:5) and Cu<sub>2</sub>P<sub>7</sub>-CoP (1:6) corresponded well to Cu<sub>2</sub>P<sub>7</sub> (JCPDS No. 47-1566) and CoP (JCPDS No. 29-0497), implying the successful integration of Cu<sub>2</sub>P<sub>7</sub> and CoP in the Cu<sub>2</sub>P<sub>7</sub>-CoP products. Interestingly, Figure S2 indicated that the sample prepared by Cu salt was Cu<sub>x</sub>P<sub>y</sub>, where the diffraction peaks were attributed to Cu<sub>3</sub>P (JCPDS No. 71-2261) and CuP<sub>2</sub> (JCPDS No. 18-0452). Because  $Cu_2P_7$  is not as stable as others, [30,31] pure Cu<sub>2</sub>P<sub>7</sub> can't be obtained after phosphating the sole Cubased precursor. However, the copper phosphide in the product is a pure Cu<sub>2</sub>P<sub>7</sub> phase after phosphiding the Cu/Cobased precursor, which indicated there was a strong interaction between Cu<sub>2</sub>P<sub>7</sub> and CoP in the product.

The transmission electron microscope (TEM) was further utilized to characterize the products. Figure S3 showed that the Cu/Co-based precursors synthesized after microwave heating the DES containing Cu/Co salts was in flake morphology. From the TEM image and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image (Figure 2b-2c), the as-prepared Cu<sub>2</sub>P<sub>7</sub>-CoP (1:5) possessed nanosheet structure, in which some nanopores were found on the surface, owing to the strong corrosion during the phosphiding reaction. The unique porous nanosheet structure not only contributes to the facile transport of reactants, but also enables to expose abundant active sites for electrocatalytic reaction. The detail microstructure of the synthesized Cu<sub>2</sub>P<sub>7</sub>-CoP was further characterized by the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). HRTEM image of Cu<sub>2</sub>P<sub>7</sub>-CoP (1:5) clearly demonstrated the distinct interface between Cu<sub>2</sub>P<sub>7</sub> and CoP, where the lattice spacing of 0.355 nm and 0.278 nm, corresponded to (31-2) plane of Cu<sub>2</sub>P<sub>7</sub> and (002) plane of CoP, respectively (Figure 2d, Figure S4). This result thus verified that the Cu<sub>2</sub>P<sub>7</sub>-CoP (1:5) possessed heterostructure with strong interaction between Cu<sub>2</sub>P<sub>7</sub> and CoP. The energydispersive X-ray (EDX) element mapping result indicated the uniform distribution of Cu, Co and P elements in Cu<sub>2</sub>P<sub>7</sub>-CoP (1:5) nanosheets (Figure 2e). The Cu/Co atomic ratios in all samples were further proved by EDX spectra (Figure S5-S7), which agreed well with the initial feeding atomic ratio of Cu/ Co. The morphologies of CoP, Cu<sub>2</sub>P<sub>7</sub>-CoP (1:4) and Cu<sub>2</sub>P<sub>7</sub>-CoP (1:6) were also studied, which showed similar nanosheet structure with that of Cu<sub>2</sub>P<sub>7</sub>-CoP (1:5) (Figure S8-S10). This indicated that the flake precursors recovered from microwave-heated DES could be used as general precursors for conversion into nanosheets.

The electron interaction between Cu<sub>2</sub>P<sub>7</sub> and CoP in the synthesized Cu<sub>2</sub>P<sub>7</sub>-CoP (1:5) heterostructure nanosheets was further studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Figure 3a-3c). For comparison, the synthesized CoP and Cu<sub>x</sub>P<sub>v</sub> were also investigated. In the high-resolution XPS spectra of the synthesized CoP (Figure 3a), the Co 2p<sub>3/2</sub> region showed two peaks at 778.5 eV and 781.6 eV, while the Co 2p<sub>1/2</sub> region exhibited two peaks at 797.8 eV and 793.5 eV.[32] From Figure 3b, the P 2p region of the synthesized CoP exhibited two peaks at 129.2 eV and 130.2 eV, which belonged to P 2p<sub>3/2</sub> and P 2p<sub>1/2</sub>, respectively.<sup>[33]</sup> The binding energy of Co 2p (778.5 eV) showed a positive shift in contrast to Co metal (778.1-778.2 eV) while the P 2p binding energy (129.2 eV) exhibited a negative shift in comparison with elemental P (130.1 eV). [34] Thus, it suggested that the Co in the synthesized CoP possessed a positive charge  $(\delta +)$ while the P possessed a negative charge  $(\delta -)$ . This indicated electron transfer from Co to P in the as-synthesized CoP.[35] Interestingly, compared with the synthesized CoP, the XPS peaks of Co 2p<sub>1/2</sub> and Co 2p<sub>3/2</sub> in the synthesized Cu<sub>2</sub>P<sub>7</sub>-CoP (1:5) moved to higher binding energy in contrast to the synthesized CoP (Figure 3a). Meanwhile, the signals of Cu 2p<sub>1/2</sub> and Cu 2p<sub>3/2</sub> in the synthesized Cu<sub>2</sub>P<sub>7</sub>-CoP (1:5) shifted to higher binding energy in contrast to the synthesized Cu<sub>x</sub>P<sub>v</sub> (Figure 3c).  $^{[36]}$  Moreover, the P  $^{2}P_{3/2}$  and P  $^{2}P_{1/2}$  peaks of the synthesized Cu<sub>2</sub>P<sub>7</sub>-CoP (1:5) moved to a lower binding

energy than the synthesized CoP and Cu<sub>x</sub>P<sub>y</sub> (Figure 3b), which further indicated the existence of strong electron interactions between CoP and Cu<sub>2</sub>P<sub>7</sub> in Cu<sub>2</sub>P<sub>7</sub>-CoP (1:5) heterostructure. Furthermore, the XPS result indicated that electrons were transferred from Co and Cu to P, which thus leaded to the accumulation of electrons on heterogeneous interfaces and P, the generation of holes on CoP and Cu<sub>2</sub>P<sub>7</sub>, and an increase in the number of positively charged Co and Cu centers ( $\delta$  +). The redistribution of surface charges by heterogeneous interface of Cu<sub>2</sub>P<sub>7</sub>-CoP might improve the adsorption performance of active components on catalyst, while the increase in the positivity of Co and Cu could enhance its electrooxidation ability.[37,38] The N<sub>2</sub> adsorption-desorption isotherm (Figure 3d) demonstrated that the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) specific surface areas of the as-prepared CoP,  $Cu_2P_7$ -CoP (1:4),  $Cu_2P_7$ -CoP (1:5) and  $Cu_2P_7$ -CoP (1:6) were 4.04, 8.23, 21.97 and 4.70  $\text{m}^2\text{ g}^{-1}$ , respectively, indicating that Cu<sub>2</sub>P<sub>7</sub>-CoP (1:5) had the largest specific surface area. From TEM images (Figure 2b, Figure S8-10), it can be seen that Cu<sub>2</sub>P<sub>7</sub>-CoP (1:5) nanosheets have more pores than other samples, so Cu<sub>2</sub>P<sub>7</sub>-CoP (1:5) nanosheets have the largest BET comparison area.[39-41] The pore size distribution indicated that the synthesized Cu<sub>2</sub>P<sub>7</sub>-CoP (1:5) nanosheets possessed mesoporous microstructure (Figure S11). Large specific surface area and mesoporous properties enable more active sites and facile electron transfer, which is beneficial to improve the catalytic performance of Cu<sub>2</sub>P<sub>7</sub>-CoP (1:5) nanosheets.

The electrocatalytic properties of the synthesized CoP,  $Cu_2P_7$ -CoP (1:4),  $Cu_2P_7$ -CoP (1:5) and  $Cu_2P_7$ -CoP (1:6) for the oxidation of HMF were further investigated in 1.0 M KOH. As oxygen evolution reaction (OER) was the main competitive reaction of HMF, the polarization curves of Cu<sub>2</sub>P<sub>7</sub>-CoP (1:5), Cu<sub>2</sub>P<sub>7</sub>-CoP (1:4) and Cu<sub>2</sub>P<sub>7</sub>-CoP (1:6) in the electrolyte with or without HMF were studied for comparison (Figure S12). All the potentials were referred to RHE. From Figure S12, the catalytic effect of Cu<sub>2</sub>P<sub>7</sub>-CoP (1:5) in 10 mM HMF only needed 1.27 V to achieve 30 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, which was 300 mV lower than that of OER. This indicated that the HMF oxidation was more favorable than water oxidation in thermodynamics upon using Cu<sub>2</sub>P<sub>7</sub>-CoP (1:5) as the electrocatalyst. [42-44] In order to better compare the catalytic effects of different samples, the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) results of CoP, Cu<sub>2</sub>P<sub>7</sub>-CoP (1:4),  $Cu_2P_7$ -CoP (1:5) and  $Cu_2P_7$ -CoP (1:6) in the electrolyte containing HMF were shown in Figure 4a. The Cu<sub>2</sub>P<sub>7</sub>-CoP (1:5) showed better electrocatalytic oxidation performance for HMF than CoP, Cu<sub>2</sub>P<sub>7</sub>-CoP (1:4) and Cu<sub>2</sub>P<sub>7</sub>-CoP (1:6) because its current density was much higher at same potential. For example, Figure S13a showed that the current density of electrochemical oxidation of HMF catalyzed by Cu<sub>2</sub>P<sub>7</sub>-CoP (1:5) could reach 68.03 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> when the potential was 1.43 V. From Figure 4b, in contrast to CoP  $(266.7 \text{ mV dec}^{-1})$ ,  $Cu_2P_7$ -CoP  $(1:4, 64.3 \text{ mV dec}^{-1})$ , and  $Cu_2P_7$ -CoP (1:6, 209.1 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>), the  $Cu_2P_7$ -CoP (1:5) afforded a smaller Tafel slope of 48.2 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>, which further proved

that the kinetics of electrocatalytic oxidation of HMF by

Cu<sub>2</sub>P<sub>7</sub>-CoP (1:5) was more rapid. To understand the inherent

activity of the synthesized Cu<sub>2</sub>P<sub>7</sub>-CoP (from 1:4 to 1:6), their electrochemical double layer capacitance (C<sub>dl</sub>) in the nonfaradaic region was determined by cyclic voltammetry (CV) to evaluate the electrochemical specific surface area (ECSA) (Figure 4c, Figure S14). As shown in Figure 4c, Cu<sub>2</sub>P<sub>7</sub>-CoP (1:5) showed the largest C<sub>dl</sub> of 1.21 mFcm<sup>-2</sup>, while the CoP,  $Cu_2P_7$ -CoP (1:4) and  $Cu_2P_7$ -CoP (1:6) were with 0.21 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>, 0.49 mF cm<sup>-2</sup> and 0.39 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>, respectively. As a result, the corresponding ECSA values of CoP, Cu<sub>2</sub>P<sub>7</sub>-CoP (1:4), Cu<sub>2</sub>P<sub>7</sub>-CoP (1:5) and  $Cu_2P_7$ -CoP (1:6) were 5.25 cm<sup>2</sup>, 12.25 cm<sup>2</sup>, 30.25 cm<sup>2</sup>, and 9.75 cm<sup>2</sup>. This clearly showed that heterostructure could significantly increase the ECSA of the catalyst. Among them, the Cu<sub>2</sub>P<sub>7</sub>-CoP (1:5) had the highest electrochemical active surface area. The LSV curves were also normalized by ECSA (Figure S13b). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used to investigate the catalytic kinetics of the as-synthesized Cu<sub>2</sub>P<sub>7</sub>-CoP. By comparing the Nyquist plots of CoP and Cu<sub>2</sub>P<sub>7</sub>-CoP at 1.43 V (Figure 4d), it was found that the charge transfer resistance of Cu<sub>2</sub>P<sub>7</sub>-CoP (1:5) was the smallest, indicating that  $Cu_2P_7$ -CoP (1:5) possessed good charge transfer rate and accelerated electrochemical kinetics of HMF oxidation. Therefore, the strong interface effect enabled by the heterostructure in Cu<sub>2</sub>P<sub>7</sub>-CoP (1:5) nanosheets was more beneficial to the fast electron transport. The above result thus verified that Cu<sub>2</sub>P<sub>7</sub>-CoP (1:5) catalyst had abundant active sites and low charge transfer resistance for electrocatalysis, endowing it with better electroactivity than other samples.

There exist two possible paths in the oxidation reaction of HMF to FDCA (Figure 5a), including the initial oxidation into 2,5-diformyl furan (DFF) intermediates (path 1) and 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furan carboxylic acid (HMFCA) intermediates (path 2). Both of DFF and HMFCA are then converted to 2-formyl-5-furancarboxylic acid (FFCA) and FDCA. Based on

the best electroactivity of Cu<sub>2</sub>P<sub>7</sub>-CoP (1:5) from the above result, this product was selected as the typical electrocatalyst for further studying the electrooxidation of HMF in detail. In our study, 10 mL electrolyte of 1.0 M KOH with 10 mM HMF was studied at 1.43 V. For a complete HMF conversion to FDCA, it needs 58 C (theoretical charge). The concentration changes of various compounds in the electrolyte during the reaction were determined via high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (Figure S15, Figure 5b). Figure 5b showed that the HMF concentration decreased gradually along with the increase of FDCA concentration during the reaction. After the total charge became 58 C, the HMF was almost completely converted into FDCA with none detected DFF intermediate, indicating that path 2 played a dominant role in the electrooxidation of HMF. At a constant potential of 1.43 V, the current density of the reaction decreased with the decrease of HMF concentration (Figure 5c). Meanwhile, the color of the electrolyte varied from yellow to the colorless before and after electrolysis (the insert photograph in Figure 5c).

In the process of electrolysis, the concentration of each substance changed with the increase of reaction charge, as shown in Figure 6a. After reaction, the conversion of HMF was 100% while the FDCA yield was 98.8% along with a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 98%. By comparison, it was found that the catalytic performance of Cu<sub>2</sub>P<sub>7</sub>-CoP (1:5) for HMF electroxidation is better than most reported catalysts (Table S1). This clearly proved that the strategy of heterostructure engineering by Cu<sub>2</sub>P<sub>7</sub> could significantly improve the intrinsic activity of CoP for electrooxidation of HMF. The stability of Cu<sub>2</sub>P<sub>7</sub>-CoP (1:5) in eight consecutive electrolytic cycles was verified. Figure 6b showed that the catalytic activity of Cu<sub>2</sub>P<sub>7</sub>-CoP (1:5) had not obviously decreased after eight consecutive electrolytic cycles, demonstrating its

durable HMF conversion ability. After cyclic electrolysis test, the chemical composition and morphology of  $Cu_2P_7$ -CoP (1:5) were further analyzed by TEM, XRD and XPS. The TEM result demonstrated that the  $Cu_2P_7$ -CoP (1:5) still retained the porous nanosheet structure after the cyclic durability test (Figure S16). Meanwhile, the results of XRD and XPS confirmed that the chemical composition of the catalyst almost unchanged (Figure S17 and S18).

In order to unveil the reason of the boosted HMF electrooxidation of  $Cu_2P_7$ -CoP, open-circuit potential (OCP) approach and density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed. The OCP can reflect the organic adsorbent variation in inner Helmholtz layer, enabling to estimate HMF adsorption behavior on catalyst. Upon adding HMF in the electrolyte, the OCP change of  $Cu_2P_7$ -CoP (1:5) was 0.60 V, which was more significant than that of CoP (0.42 V) (Fig-

ure 7a). This result indicated that HMF had stronger surface adsorption on Cu<sub>2</sub>P<sub>7</sub>-CoP (1:5), enabling a better electrocatalytic performance. The DFT calculation results further confirmed it. The optimized structural models of CoP and Cu<sub>2</sub>P<sub>7</sub>-CoP (1:5) were shown in Figure S19, Figure S20 and Table S2–S4. The HMF adsorption energies on CoP and Cu<sub>2</sub>P<sub>7</sub>-CoP (1:5) surfaces were achieved by DFT calculations (Figure S21-S22, Table S5-S6). Figure 7b showed that the HMF adsorption energy on  $Cu_2P_7$ -CoP (1:5) was -1.82 eV, which was lower than the adsorption energy on CoP (-1.32 eV). The result of adsorption energy further demonstrated the more favorable HMF adsorption on Cu<sub>2</sub>P<sub>7</sub>-CoP (1:5), agreeing well with the OCP approach. Such a low adsorption energy enables reduction of reaction barrier, accelerating the electrooxidation of HMF on Cu<sub>2</sub>P<sub>7</sub>-CoP (1:5) surface. To further clarify the electroactivity of Cu<sub>2</sub>P<sub>7</sub>-CoP (1:5), the

difference in charge density was calculated. In Figure 7c, yellow represented the electron accumulation region while blue represented the electron depletion region. The results showed that electron transfer and redistribution occurred between Cu<sub>2</sub>P<sub>7</sub> and CoP due to the formation of heterostructure. Combined with the result of two-dimensional charge difference isosurface (Figure 7d), it indicated that the electron transfer from Co and Cu to P resulted in the accumulation of electrons at the Cu<sub>2</sub>P<sub>7</sub>-CoP heterogeneous interface as well as the generation and accumulation of holes on CoP and Cu<sub>2</sub>P<sub>7</sub>. The results were consistent with those of calculated adsorption energy and XPS analysis. The accumulation of holes in CoP and Cu<sub>2</sub>P<sub>7</sub> was beneficial to the HMF adsorption, thus facilitating the electrooxidation of HMF. Meanwhile, the accumulation of electrons on heterogeneous interfaces enables to promote electron transfer rate and improve catalytic activity. Consequently, the DFT calculation results demonstrated the importance of Cu<sub>2</sub>P<sub>7</sub>-CoP heterostructure in accelerating electron transfer rate, improving HMF adsorption and regulating catalytic activity.

## **Conclusions**

In summary, Cu<sub>2</sub>P<sub>7</sub>-CoP heterostructure nanosheets was designed as the powerful electrocatalyst for electrooxidation of HMF into FDCA. The Cu<sub>2</sub>P<sub>7</sub>-CoP heterostructure nanosheets were achieved via microwave-assisted DES approach, along with subsequent phosphiding. The Cu<sub>2</sub>P<sub>7</sub>-CoP heterostructure nanosheets afforded outstanding electrooxidation performance, with 100% HMF conversion, 98.8% FDCA yield and 98% FE at 1.43 V, exceeding most of the reported electrocatalysts. The enhanced electrooxidation performance of Cu<sub>2</sub>P<sub>7</sub>-CoP heterostructure nanosheets was ascribed to the abundant active sites, rapid electron transfer rate and synergy between Cu<sub>2</sub>P<sub>7</sub> and CoP in the heterostructure, as demonstrated by XPS analysis, OCP method and DFT calculations. Particularly, electron transfer and redistribution occurred between Cu<sub>2</sub>P<sub>7</sub> and CoP, improving the adsorption capacity of HMF and modulating the catalytic performance. The present work afforded a conceptually innovative DESbased strategy for the design of advanced heterostructure electrocatalyst in HMF electrooxidation.

## **Experimental Section**

# Synthesis of Choline Chloride/Oxalic Acid (ChCl/OA) Deep Eutectic Solvent (DES)

The DES was synthesized based on the literature.  $^{[45,46]}$  Oxalic acid and choline chloride were mixed in equimolar amount, and reacted at 80 °C for 30 min by magnetic stirring to obtain ChCl/OA DES.

### Synthesis of Cu<sub>2</sub>P<sub>7</sub>-CoP Heterostructure Nanosheets

The  $Cu_2P_7$ -CoP products with different proportions of initial Cu and Co sources are marked as  $Cu_2P_7$ -CoP (x:y), where x:y is the initial feeding Cu/Co atomic ratio. For the synthesis of  $Cu_2P_7$ -CoP (1:5) product, the Cu/Co-based precursor was first synthesized via a microwave-assisted DES approach. In a typical procedure, 7.2 mg  $C_{10}H_{14}CuO_4$  and 32.8 mg  $CoCl_2 \cdot 6H_2O$  were added in 1 mL ChCl/OA DES under ultrasonication at 45 °C. The as-prepared green liquid was heated by microwave for 15 s at 100 W to achieve Cu/Co-based precursors. Subsequently, the Cu/Co-based precursors were recovered, washed by ethanol for several times, and dried in vacuum at room temperature for 4 h.

Next, the dried Cu/Co-based precursor and the NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>2</sub> were placed downstream and upstream of the corundum tube of the tube furnace, respectively. Then, Cu<sub>2</sub>P<sub>7</sub>-CoP (1:5) product was obtained by heating the Cu/Co-based precursor at 350 °C with 10 °C min<sup>-1</sup> for 2 h in N<sub>2</sub> atmosphere. Finally, the obtained Cu<sub>2</sub>P<sub>7</sub>-CoP (1:5) heterostructure nanosheets were washed by water and ethanol, and then were dried in the vacuum oven.

For contrast,  $Cu_2P_7$ -CoP (1:4) and  $Cu_2P_7$ -CoP (1:6) products were also fabricated based on the above method. The  $C_{10}H_{14}CuO_4$  and  $CoCl_2 \cdot 6H_2O$  used for synthesizing  $Cu_2P_7$ -CoP (1:4) was 8.6 mg and 31.4 mg, respectively, while the amount of  $C_{10}H_{14}CuO_4$  and  $CoCl_2 \cdot 6H_2O$  for synthesizing  $Cu_2P_7$ -CoP (1:6) was 6.2 mg and 33.8 mg, respectively. The CoP product was also prepared by the same procedure without adding  $C_{10}H_{14}CuO_4$ , while the  $Cu_xP_y$  product was synthesized without addition of  $CoCl_2 \cdot 6H_2O$ .

#### **Electrochemical Measurements**

Electrochemical characterizations were tested on a CHI760E workstation. Here, carbon paper-loaded catalysts (working electrode), platinum foil (counter electrode), and saturated Ag/AgCl (reference electrode) were utilized. 1 M KOH (10 mL) solution with or without 10 mM HMF was used as electrolytes.

4 mg catalyst (the synthesized product) in the mixture of ethanol (175  $\mu L)$  and nafion (25  $\mu L$ , 5 wt.%) was sonicated to achieve a catalyst ink. Next, 200  $\mu L$  catalyst ink was put on the carbon paper (1×1 cm²) for preparing working electrode. The LSV test was conducted with 10 mV s $^{-1}$ . The ECSA values were obtained according to ECSA =  $C_{dl}/C_{sr}$ , where  $C_{s}$  is 40  $\mu F$  cm $^{-2}$ . CV experiments were conducted between 0.9 V to 1.0 V. EIS characterization was conducted at 5 mV with 0.1 to  $10^6$  Hz. The potentials in this study were all referenced against the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) by the formula:

$$E (RHE) = E (Ag/AgCI) + 0.197 + 0.059 \times pH$$

### **Product Analysis**

The concentrations of the components in the electrolyte were assayed via high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a 4.6 mm  $\times$  250 mm Zorbax SB—C18 5  $\mu m$  column and an ultraviolet-visible detector. The UV-Vis detector was with a wavelength of 265 nm. HPLC eluents were mixtures of 5 mM aqueous ammonium formate (volume: 70%) and methanol (volume: 30%).

The HMF conversion, selectivity and faradaic efficiency (FE) were achieved according to below equations:

HMF conversion (%) =

[n (HMF consumption)/ n (HMF initial value)]  $\times$  100% (2)

Selectivity (%) =

[n (Product formation)/n (HMF initial value)]  $\times$  100%

Faraday efficiency (%) =

[(n (FDCA formation) 
$$\times$$
 6F)/Q]  $\times$  100%

Where, n is the mole number, Q is the total transferred charge and F is  $96485 \text{ C mol}^{-1}$ .

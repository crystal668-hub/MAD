**Electrochemical oxidation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) using non-precious transition metal catalysts presents a sustainable pathway for producing high-value 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA). Manganese-based materials hold promise for HMF oxidation reactions but suffer from low intrinsic conductivity and sluggish kinetics in the formation of high-valence Mn active species. Herein, a multi-scale engineering strategy to construct a 3D Ag-Mn(OH)2-OV/nickel foam (NF) catalyst by synergistically integrating electrochemical activation-induced MoO4 <sup>2</sup><sup>−</sup> leaching and Ag nanoparticle modification on a pre-synthesized MnMoO4/NF is proposed. Spectroscopic characterizations reveal that this dual-functional modification strategy collectively generates an Ag-Mn(OH)2-OV/NF heterostructure enriched with oxygen vacancies (OV), thereby facilitating the formation of high-valent Mn3<sup>+</sup> active centers. Moreover, the synergistic interplay between OV and Ag nanoparticles not only enhances the adsorption of reactants and reaction intermediates but also optimizes interfacial charge transfer, consequently lowering the overall reaction energy barrier. These cooperative effects collectively drive the superior catalytic performance of the Ag-Mn(OH)2-OV/NF. As a result, the Ag-Mn(OH)2-OV/NF catalyst achieves 100% HMF conversion rate and 98.60% FDCA Faradaic efficiency (FE) at 1.40 V versus. RHE, with its FE significantly higher than those of catalysts Mn(OH)2-OV/NF (70.11%) and Ag/NF (62.02%), and the electrolysis time is approximately halved.**

## **1. Introduction**

2,5-Furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) has emerged as a pivotal biomass-derived platform molecule, demonstrating exceptional versatility in synthesizing various high-value functional materials.[\[1\]](#page-11-0) One important application lies in its role as a sustainable substitute for petroleum-derived terephthalic acid, enabling the production of biodegradable polyesters such as polyethylene furanoate (PEF), a next-generation polymer exhibiting superior reproducibility, mechanical, and gas barrier properties compared to conventional PET.[\[2,3\]](#page-11-0) Industrially, the synthesis of FDCA predominantly relies on heterogeneous thermochemical catalytic oxidation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) using noble metal catalysts (e.g., Pt, Pd, Ru) under energy-intensive conditions.[\[4,5\]](#page-11-0) This route also generates by-products like monoformate derivatives, hindering downstream utilization.[\[6\]](#page-11-0) Alternatively, the selective production of FDCA can

be achieved through the electrocatalytic oxidation of HMF over the non-precious transition metal (hydr)oxides-based catalysts such as Co, Ni, Fe, and their hybrids under mild conditions via renewable electricity, which has attracted growing attention.[\[4,7\]](#page-11-0) For those transition metal (hydr)oxides-based catalysts, the in situ generated high valence metal species have been identified as the catalytic active species through operando characterization techniques.[\[8–11\]](#page-11-0) These species predominantly operate via an indirect oxidation pathway known as the "electrochemical-chemical" (E-C) mechanism, where initial electrochemical oxidation is followed by chemical redox processes.[\[5\]](#page-11-0) Thus, the rational design of catalysts that facilitate the formation and stabilization of highvalence metal active centers is significant.

Previous studies have demonstrated that oxygen vacancies (OV) in metal (hydr)oxides can significantly promote the formation of highly covalent metal-oxygen (M-O) active sites through a series of OH<sup>−</sup> adsorption and lattice hydroxyl groups dehydrogenation steps (M<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup>-O-H⇌M<sup>3</sup><sup>+</sup>-O), benefiting to enhancing electrochemical oxidation activity.[\[12\]](#page-11-0) Besides, the presence of OV also favors the adsorption of reactants and charge transfer. To make good use of these advantages, various engineering strategies, including heteroatom doping, plasma etching, interfacial engineering, and anion leaching, have been developed to optimize OV concentration in transition metal (hydr)oxide-based catalysts.[\[13–15\]](#page-11-0) Of which, the electrochemical-induced anion leaching approach has emerged as a particularly promising strategy due to its capacity to induce substantial structural evolution, thereby generating abundant oxygen vacancies.[\[16\]](#page-11-0) For instance, transition metal molybdate such as CoMoO4, [\[17\]](#page-11-0) and NiMoO4, [\[18\]](#page-11-0) undergo dynamic self-reconstruction under applied potentials via controlled MoO4 <sup>2</sup><sup>−</sup> leaching. This process not only creates defect-rich surfaces but also generates high valence metal active species, thereby significantly accelerating oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics. Notably, MnMoO4 stands out as an ideal candidate for electrocatalytic applications due to its unique phase-transformed derivatives, which exhibit the following critical advantages: 1) the Jahn–Teller distortion in Mn<sup>3</sup><sup>+</sup>-rich phases promotes spontaneous oxygen vacancy generation during structural reconstruction; 2) multi-electron redox flexibility enables versatile reaction pathways; 3) tunable d-band configuration permits optimization of Mn-O covalency to balance adsorption/desorption thermodynamics; 4) relatively low OER activity compared to Co/Ni-based catalysts, which could minimize competitive OER side reactions during 5-hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation reaction (HMFOR). These synergistic properties establish MnMoO4 as an ideal platform for in situ generation of Mn-based catalysts tailored for HM-FOR applications.

Nevertheless, Mn-based materials remain underexplored as primary catalysts for HMFOR. This limitation may stem from their poor intrinsic conductivity and instability of high-valent Mn species.[\[19,20\]](#page-11-0) Consequently, current research predominantly employs Mn as a dopant in composite systems to optimize intermediate adsorption.[\[21–23\]](#page-11-0) To unlock the potential of Mn-based materials in HMFOR, a further rational catalyst design is necessary. Incorporating noble metals offers a promising strategy due to their strong electronic modulation capability. For instance, noble metals including Pt,[\[24\]](#page-11-0) Pd,[\[25,26\]](#page-11-0) Ru,[\[27,28\]](#page-11-0) Ag[\[29\]](#page-11-0) have been demonstrated to enhance adsorption and desorption of reactive intermediates and charge transfer efficiency. Moreover, the strong electronic interaction between noble metal and the metal (hydr)oxides can weaken the M-O bond, resulting in easier-toremove lattice oxygen in the substrate to OV. [\[28\]](#page-11-0) Among them, Ag is worth special concern as its cost-effectiveness and unique C═O group affinity in HMF endow it as the ideal cocatalyst for HMFOR.[\[29\]](#page-11-0) Based on the above, leveraging the synergistic effect between dynamic surface reconstruction and the alteration of electronic structure by noble metals may effectively address catalytic performance limitations in Mn-based materials, a field that merits further exploration.

Herein, we developed a MnMoO4/NF precursor through hydrothermal synthesis of MnMoO4 nanosheets on nickel foam, which was subsequently subjected to cyclic voltammetry (CV) activation and Ag nanoparticle decoration. The resulting Ag-Mn(OH)2-OV/NF catalyst demonstrated exceptional catalytic performance, achieving a low onset potential of 1.2 V versus. RHE and complete HMF conversion rate at 1.40 V versus. RHE with a high current density of 48.50 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> and a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 98.60% for FDCA production, coupled with excellent long-term operational stability. Through comprehensive spectroscopic analysis, we revealed that MoO4 <sup>2</sup><sup>−</sup> leaching primarily induces structural reorganization rather than directly engaging in catalysis, while the in situ generated high-valence Mn<sup>3</sup><sup>+</sup> species serve as the principal active sites. Crucially, both the structural reorganization during CV activation and Ag nanoparticle decoration synergistically promote the formation of OV in the transformed Mn(OH)2 nanosheets, which facilitates the generation and stabilization of catalytically active Mn<sup>3</sup><sup>+</sup> species. Mechanistic studies further demonstrated that the Ag nanoparticles and OV sites cooperatively enhance the adsorption of both reactants and reaction intermediates while optimizing charge transfer efficiency, thereby enabling the efficient cascade oxidation process

## **2. Results and Discussion**

## **2.1. Characterization of Electrocatalysts**

The synthesis of Ag-Mn(OH)2-OV/NF involves a series of hydrothermal, chemical precipitation, and cyclic voltammetry (CV) electrochemical activation steps. As depicted in **Figure 1**[a,](#page-2-0) the MnMoO4 nanosheets were first hydrothermally grown on NF as the precursor. Subsequent electrochemical activation was carried out in the 1 m KOH solution until stabilization of the CV curves was achieved (≈10 min) (Figure S1, Supporting Information), resulting in a phase transformation from MnMoO4 to Mn(OH)2 while simultaneously introducing OV. The OVrich surface was then functionalized with Ag species through a rapid chemical precipitation step, followed by another run electrochemical activation (≈10 min) to Ag-Mn(OH)2-OV/NF (synthesis details are in the Experimental Section). The morphology and microstructure of the synthesized samples were characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). As shown in Figures [1a,b](#page-2-0) and S2–S7 (Supporting Information), samples including MnMoO4/NF, Mn(OH)2-OV/NF, and Ag-Mn(OH)2-OV/NF all exhibited nanosheet array structures. These nanosheets were uniformly and densely anchored on the NF substrate surface. Significantly, upon CV activation, the nanosheets on Ag-Mn(OH)2-OV/NF underwent bending and deformation. Such a structural transformation is conducive to improving the

electrochemical performance of the composite. The crystalline nature of the above-mentioned compounds in each step was then characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD). As revealed in Figure 1c, the hydrothermal-derived precursors exhibited XRD patterns that closely matched the standard reference for Mn(MoO4)(H2O) (PDF#78-0220), verifying the successful preparation of the desired precursor. Notably, distinct phase transformation occurred following the initial electrochemical CV activation, with emerging diffraction peaks corresponding to Mn(OH)2 (PDF#73-1133) and MoO3(H2O)2 (PDF#70-1513). This structural reconstruction suggests significant chemical reorganization during the activation process. Subsequent Ag decorating coupled with additional electrochemical activation induced further structural modifications, as evidenced by the appearance of characteristic Ag diffraction peaks at (111), (200), (220), and (311) crystal planes. These observations collectively confirm the successful integration of Ag species and the formation of the silver-modified Mn(OH)2 composite structure. The morphologies of the prepared materials were initially examined by low-magnification transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Figure S8, Supporting Information). As shown, a thick nanosheet structure of MnMoO4 precursors was observed (Figure S8a, Supporting Information) and then changed to wrinkled nanosheet morphology after the first run CV activation and Ag<sup>+</sup> adsorption (Figure S8b,c, Supporting Information). Then, a thicker nanosheet comprised of small particles appeared in the final CV activation (Figure S8d, Supporting Information). To get a closer look at the material's microstructure and lattice fringes, High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) was further carried out. As shown in Figure 1d, the observed lattice space of 0.557 nm and 0.679 nm on the MnMoO4 nanosheet precursor corresponds to the Mn(MoO4)H2O (010) and (001) phases, respectively. In the case

of Ag-Mn(OH)<sub>2</sub>-O<sub>V</sub>/NF (Figure 1e), a lattice spacing of 0.118, 0.265, and 0.204 nm could be assigned to the (004) plane of Mn(OH)<sub>2</sub>, (004) plane of MoO<sub>3</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>2</sub>, and (200) plane of metallic Ag, respectively. The lattice fringe features of each precursor are consistent with the XRD analysis results. Moreover, the high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) image and corresponding energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mapping of the prepared materials were employed to reveal the distribution and signal intensity of Mn, Mo, O, Ag, or Ni elements throughout the catalyst's surface (Figures S9–S12, Supporting Information). By comparison, the CV-activated precursors exhibited a weaker Mo signal intensity relative to the freshly prepared ones, verifying the dissolution of Mo during the CV process.

To determine the chemical state of the as-prepared samples, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was employed. The full-scan XPS spectra of MnMoO<sub>4</sub>/NF, Mn(OH)<sub>2</sub>-O<sub>V</sub>/NF, Ag-Mn(OH)<sub>2</sub>-O<sub>V</sub>/NF, and Ag/NF are presented in Figure S13 (Supporting Information). The high-resolution XPS spectra of the elements Mn, Mo, O, and Ag are displayed in Figure 2. Figure 2a shows the Mn 2p spectrum of MnMoO<sub>4</sub>/NF. As shown, a pair of Mn 2p<sub>3/2</sub> and 2p<sub>1/2</sub> core-level peaks at the ranges of 636.92–638.33 and 648.46–649.78 eV, together with a satellite peak at 642.9 eV, were observed. The two Mn 2p core-level peaks can be further separately deconvoluted into two more peaks, which are assigned to Mn<sup>2+</sup> and Mn<sup>3+</sup> species, confirming the coexistence of Mn in the +2 and +3 oxidation states in the pristine catalyst. [30] After the first CV activation, the binding energies

of all Mn 2p peaks in Mn(OH)<sub>2</sub>-O<sub>V</sub>/NF were upshifted by  $\approx$ 4.1 eV, and the satellite peak of Mn<sup>2+</sup> disappeared. The change in the chemical state originates from the electrochemical leaching of MoO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>, which partially reconstructs MnMoO<sub>4</sub> into Mn(OH)<sub>2</sub> in the alkaline solution. Thus, the observed Mn 2p binding energy is characteristic of the reconstructed Mn(OH), chemical state. [31,32] Further Ag decoration followed by an additional CV activation did not cause an obvious change of binding energy but significantly altered the Mn<sup>3+</sup>/Mn<sup>2+</sup> ratio. As listed in Table S1 (Supporting Information), the Mn<sup>3+</sup>/Mn<sup>2+</sup> ratio exhibits distinct variations across different catalysts: 1.94 for MnMoO<sub>4</sub>/NF, 1.63 for  $Mn(OH)_2$ -O<sub>V</sub>/NF, and 4.03 for Ag-Mn(OH)<sub>2</sub>-O<sub>V</sub>/NF, exhibiting a trend of initial decrease followed by a substantial increase. These variations can be rationalized by the stabilization effect of Ag nanoparticles in Ag-Mn(OH)<sub>2</sub>-O<sub>V</sub>/NF. Namely, the formed Mn<sup>3+</sup> species can be stabilized by Ag nanoparticles through interfacial electronic interactions, whereas the in situ generated Mn<sup>3+</sup> in Mn(OH)<sub>2</sub>-O<sub>V</sub>/NF underwent a spontaneous reduction to low valence Mn species because it lacks such stabilization capability. For Mo 3d (Figure 2b), the MnMoO<sub>4</sub>/NF shows two peaks at 228.42 and 231.55 eV are assigned to Mo  $3d_{5/2}$  and Mo  $3d_{3/2}$ of Mo<sup>6+ [30]</sup> Similar to the Mn 2p spectrum, successive CV activation induced progressive upshifts in the Mo<sup>6+</sup> species driven by the applied positive potential. The initial activation shifted the characteristic Mo<sup>6+</sup> 3d doublet to 232.13 and 235.28 eV, with a subsequent slight shift to 232.20 and 235.37 eV after the second cycle. The binding energy shift originates from the potentialdriven phase transition from MoO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> to MoO<sub>3</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>2</sub>, yielding

Mo 3d spectra characteristic of this new chemical state. [33,34] In the O 1s XPS region (Figure 2c), the precursors MnMoO<sub>4</sub>/NF exhibited three deconvoluted peaks at 526.56 eV, 527.92 eV, and 529.22 eV, which could be identified as lattice oxygen (O<sub>1</sub>), O<sub>V</sub>, and chemisorbed oxygen ( $O_C$ ), respectively, a typical O 1s peaks characteristics of MnMoO<sub>4</sub>. [30] For Mn(OH)<sub>2</sub>-O<sub>V</sub>/NF and Ag-Mn(OH)<sub>2</sub>-O<sub>V</sub>/NF, the O<sub>1</sub> peaks were shifted to higher binding energies of ≈529.74 and 529.77 eV, corresponding to typical oxygen species in transition metal (oxy)hydroxides.[35,36] This positive binding energy shift can be attributed to the electrochemical reconstruction induced by CV activation. As can be seen, the content of each oxygen species varies in these three catalysts. Thus, a further analysis of the proportion of each oxygen species is needed. As shown in Figure \$14 (Supporting Information), the proportion of O<sub>V</sub> increased from 21.22% in MnMoO<sub>4</sub>/NF to 29.16% in Mn(OH)<sub>2</sub>-O<sub>V</sub>/NF, and ultimately reached 50.27% in Ag-Mn(OH)<sub>2</sub>-O<sub>V</sub>/NF, underscoring the pivotal role of anion leaching and noble metal loading in tuning the formation of O<sub>V</sub>. To further characterize the relative O<sub>V</sub> content in these three catalysts, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) characterization was carried out. As shown in Figure S15 (Supporting Information), all the samples have a strong EPR signal at g = 2.002, which is related to the unpaired electrons of O<sub>V</sub>. By comparing their g signal intensities, the relative amount of oxygen vacancies in different samples follows the sequence Ag-Mn(OH)<sub>2</sub>-O<sub>V</sub>/NF  $> Mn(OH)_2 - O_V/NF > MnMoO_4/NF$ , consistent with the XPS analysis. These results demonstrated that both the leaching of MoO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> and the decoration of Ag nanoparticles disrupted the lattice structure and then weakened the Mn-O bond, thereby facilitating the formation of  $O_V$ . In theory, the Ag-Mn(OH)<sub>2</sub>- $O_V/NF$ with abundant O<sub>V</sub> might reduce the energy barrier to generate high-valence Mn species active sites and enhance the adsorption capacity for reactant molecules, which is significant for improving overall catalytic performance. [36,37] In the case of the Ag 3d spectra (Figure 2d), only two peaks at 368.21 and 374.27 eV were observed in Ag/NF, originating from metallic Ag. In comparison, Ag-Mn(OH)<sub>2</sub>-O<sub>V</sub>/NF exhibited two additional deconvoluted peaks at 367.66 and 373.66 eV, which were assigned to Ag<sup>+</sup> 3d<sub>5/2</sub> and Ag<sup>+</sup> 3d<sub>3/2</sub>, indicating the formation of Ag<sub>2</sub>O-related species. This could be caused by oxidation due to air contact and/or interfacial electron charge transfer from Ag to Mn(OH), substrate.

## 2.2. Electrochemical Property Analysis

The HMF electrochemical oxidation performance of the prepared materials was evaluated using a standard three-electrode system. Initially, linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) tests were first investigated in a 1 M KOH solution with or without 10 mm HMF. In this study, the selection of 10 mm HMF concentration was determined based on optimization experiments of the catalyst's catalytic performance at various concentrations, with detailed information provided in the Supporting Information (Figures S16 and S17, Supporting Information). All potentials mentioned in this work were versus. RHE without iR compensation. As shown in Figure 3a, catalysts Mn(OH)<sub>2</sub>-O<sub>V</sub>/NF and Ag-Mn(OH)<sub>2</sub>-O<sub>V</sub>/NF almost have the same LSV curves in the 1 M KOH electrolyte, indicating the neglected role of Ag in the OER reaction. The strong oxidation peak at the potential range of 1.15–1.35 V could be at-

tributed to the Mn2+ to Mn3+ oxidation reaction, which is usually considered as the formation of real active sites during the electrochemical oxidation.[38] To be noted, both Mn(OH)<sub>2</sub>-O<sub>V</sub>/NF and Ag-Mn(OH)2-OV/NF with Mn(OH)2 showed an enhanced catalytic OER activity compared with their counterpart Ag/NF and bare NF, verifying the good electrochemical catalytic activity of Mn(OH)<sub>2</sub>. Compared with the pure KOH system, the current density of all catalysts increased significantly after the addition of HMF, especially in the potential range of 1.3-1.5 V (Figure \$18, Supporting Information). This directly proves that the current enhancement is mainly due to the HMFOR. Moreover, when using the HMF-containing electrolyte, the differences in current density and onset potential between Mn(OH)<sub>2</sub>-O<sub>1</sub>/NF and Ag- $Mn(OH)_2$ -O<sub>V</sub>/NF became apparent (Figure 3b). As shown, the Ag-Mn(OH)2-OV/NF with additional Ag results in a lower onset potential of 1.2 V and a much higher current density compared with Mn(OH)<sub>2</sub>-O<sub>V</sub>/NF over the whole investigated potential range, underscoring the importance of Ag in improving HM-FOR performance. In particular, the shoulder peak at the range of 1.2-1.4 V of Ag-Mn(OH)<sub>2</sub>-O<sub>V</sub>/NF becomes weaker relative to the Mn(OH)<sub>2</sub>-O<sub>V</sub>/NF, indicating that Ag can reduce the energy for the oxidation of Mn<sup>2+</sup> to Mn<sup>3+</sup>. [39] A more direct comparison can be made by comparing their current density at 1.5 V. As shown in Figure 3c, the current density of Ag-Mn(OH)2-OV/NF was 61.7 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, which is twice as much as the Mn(OH)<sub>2</sub>-O<sub>V</sub>/NF  $(30.6 \text{ mA cm}^{-2})$ , followed by Ag/NF of 13.6 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> and NF of  $6.9 \text{ mA cm}^{-2}$ 

Based on these LSV results, the kinetic characteristics of the four catalysts were investigated. As shown in Figure 3d, the Ag-Mn(OH)<sub>2</sub>-O<sub>V</sub>/NF exhibits the lowest Tafel slope of 57.00 mV  $dec^{-1}$  when compared with Mn(OH)<sub>2</sub>-O<sub>V</sub>/NF of 62.85 mV  $dec^{-1}$ , NF of 156.42 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>, Ag/NF of 160.21 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>, indicating its fastest reaction kinetics among all tested catalysts, consistent with the LSV analysis. The electrochemical surface area (ECSA) of the individual and composite materials was evaluated by measuring the double-layer capacitance (C<sub>dl</sub>) via the cyclic voltammetry method in 1 м KOH with 10 mм HMF electrolyte (Figure S19, Supporting Information). As shown in Figure 3e, Ag-Mn(OH)<sub>2</sub>- $O_V/NF$  shows the largest  $C_{dl}$  value of 4.83 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>, which is 1.24 times higher than that of Mn(OH)<sub>2</sub>-O<sub>V</sub>/NF (3.89 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>), demonstrating the importance of the Ag in Ag-Mn(OH)<sub>2</sub>-O<sub>V</sub>/NF for the increased active sites. Accordingly, their ECSA values were calculated, and ECSA-normalized LSV curves were plotted. As shown in Figure S20 (Supporting Information), the ECSAnormalized current density of Ag-Mn(OH)2-OV/NF remained significantly higher than that of Mn(OH)<sub>2</sub>-O<sub>V</sub>/NF, suggesting that its enhanced catalytic performance might arise from both increased active sites and superior intrinsic electrocatalytic activity. Subsequently, an open-circuit potential (OCP) test was performed to further elucidate the role of Ag on the oxidation reaction by detecting the changes in organic adsorbed species in the Helmholtz layer. As shown in Figures 3f and S21 (Supporting Information), upon the injection of 10 mM reactant HMF and possible reaction intermediates HMFCA and FFCA, the changes in the open-circuit potential of the Ag-Mn(OH)<sub>2</sub>-O<sub>V</sub>/NF catalyst are more pronounced than those of Mn(OH)<sub>2</sub>-O<sub>V</sub>/NF, suggesting enhanced reactant and reaction intermediates adsorption in the Helmholtz inner layer of Ag-Mn(OH)<sub>2</sub>-O<sub>V</sub>/NF, which promotes the following reactions.<sup>[40]</sup> In addition, CV scans were carried out

at the potential range of 0.82–1.07 V in 1M KOH with or without HMF over catalysts Mn(OH)2-OV/NF and Ag-Mn(OH)2-OV/NF. As shown in Figure S22 (Supporting Information), an obvious adsorbed OH<sup>−</sup> (OHads) oxidation peak was observed over Ag-Mn(OH)2-OV/NF compared with Mn(OH)2-OV/NF in both investigated electrolytes, indicating an enhanced adsorption of OHads was achieved due to the incorporation of Ag.

Then, the differences in reaction kinetics between the OER and the HMFOR among catalysts were elucidated by recording their phase angle Bode plots via in situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) over a potential range of 1.1–1.7 V. As shown in Figure 3g, the Ag-Mn(OH)2-OV/NF in pure 1 M KOH exhibited two characteristic phase angle peaks corresponding to its intrinsic electrochemical oxidation and the OER. While in the presence of HMF, the Bode plot of Ag-Mn(OH)2-OV/NF exhibits three distinct peaks. As depicted in Figure 3h, the peak in the high-frequency region (101–105 Hz) is attributed to the electrochemical oxidation of the catalyst itself. The two additional peaks in the low-frequency region (10<sup>−</sup>1–101 Hz) correspond to the HMFOR at 1.3 V and OER at 1.5 V. These results indicate that the optimal potential range for HMFOR is between 1.3 and 1.5 V, which is in agreement with the results obtained from LSV curves. Moreover, the phase angle value of Ag-Mn(OH)2-OV/NF is significantly lower than that of Mn(OH)2-OV/NF in the potential range of 1.3–1.5 V, further confirming that the incorporation of Ag significantly improves the electron-transfer efficiency (Figure S23, Supporting Information). These results provide essential potential reference information for subsequent studies on reaction conditions and mechanisms, facilitating a deeper understanding of the kinetic behaviors of HMFOR and OER on these catalysts. To further assess the intrinsic catalytic activity of the four catalysts, Nyquist plots were obtained via EIS. The EIS

measurements were performed at OCP (0.7 V vs. RHE) in a 1 m KOH solution containing 10 mM HMF. As shown in Figure [3i,](#page-5-0) the comparison of their semicircle radius of the Nyquist plots indicates that relative to Mn(OH)2-OV/NF and Ag/NF, the Ag-Mn(OH)2-OV/NF has a higher electron-transfer efficiency and more efficient HMFOR reaction kinetics which is beneficial for the electrocatalytic process.

#### **2.3. Evaluation of Electrocatalytic HMF Oxidation Performance**

As discussed above, catalyst Ag-Mn(OH)2-OV/NF shows superior catalytic activity than that of its counterparts. Thus, a further insight into potential-dependent HMF conversion rate, product distribution, and FE for the generated products during the electrochemical HMFOR was carried out. Highperformance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was employed for the quantitative and qualitative analysis of electrolysis products. Prior to electrolysis, the concentration-peak area standard curves of reactant HMF and possible reaction products, such as furan-2,5-dicarbaldehyde (DFF), 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furancarboxylic acid (HMFCA), and 5-formyl-2-furancarboxylic acid (FFCA), were plotted (Figure S24, Supporting Information). The following data were determined by these standard curves.

As shown in Figure S25 (Supporting Information), the electrolysis time decreases with the increase of applied potential when passing the same theoretical charge of 289 C. The corresponding HMF conversion rate, FDCA selectivity, and FE of FDCA, as well as the product distribution, have been determined and are presented in **Figures 4**[a](#page-7-0) and S26 (Supporting Information), respectively. As shown, the Ag-Mn(OH)2-OV/NF achieves a good HMF conversion rate and FE for FDCA at the investigated potential range. For instance, a HMF conversion rate of 97.60% and an FE of 94.74% for FDCA were realized at 1.35 V, and then reached a maximum of 100% and 98.60 % at 1.4 V, respectively. At a higher applied potential, although an HMF conversion rate remained above 95% (except 1.45 V), an apparent decrease of FE for FDCA was observed. The decline is primarily attributed to the electrochemical competition between the OER and the HM-FOR (Figures S26–S28, Supporting Information). On the one hand, the activity of OER increases significantly at high potentials, consuming a large amount of charge and preventing HM-FCA from being fully converted to FDCA. On the other hand, the insufficient charge also promotes the conversion of HMF to humins through non-electrochemical pathways, indirectly consuming the raw materials and reducing the yield of the target product. As 1.4 V is the optimal potential for HMFOR, the catalytic performance of Mn(OH)2-OV /NF and Ag/NF at this potential was also collected for comparison. As evidenced in Figure S29 (Supporting Information), much less electrolysis time is needed to fully convert the HMF over Ag-Mn(OH)2-OV/NF compared with Mn(OH)2-OV/NF and Ag/NF, highlighting its superior activity. These results are further corroborated by the comparative analysis in Figure [4b,](#page-7-0) where Ag-Mn(OH)2-OV/NF exhibits the highest HMF conversion rate, FDCA selectivity, and FE, outperforming both control catalysts.

To investigate the reaction pathway and kinetics, we conducted chronoamperometric studies of HMFOR on Ag-Mn(OH)2OV/NF at 1.4 V with controlled charge application. As displayed in Figure [4c,](#page-7-0) the HPLC analysis revealed a progressive decline in HMF peak intensity concurrent with a proportional increase in FDCA signal intensity during the electrochemical process. Notably, only trace quantities of oxygenated intermediates (HMFCA and FFCA) were observed in the chromatograms, while DFF remained undetectable throughout the reaction. Accordingly, the concentrations of HMF, FDCA, HM-FCA, and FFCA were plotted as functions of charge consumption (Q) during the electrochemical process (Figure [4d\)](#page-7-0), providing a quantitative depiction of substrate consumption and product formation dynamics. This distinct product distribution profile strongly supports the predominance of Pathway 2 (consecutive oxidation through alcohol/acid intermediates) over Pathway 1 (ketone-mediated route) (Figure S30, Supporting Information).[\[41\]](#page-11-0) The minimal accumulation of partially oxidized species and absence of detectable DFF further demonstrate the exceptional cascade oxidation efficiency of Ag-Mn(OH)2- OV/NF, suggesting rapid sequential conversion of HMF through HMFCA and FFCA intermediates to ultimately produce FDCA with near-quantitative selectivity. The low detection of intermediates HMFCA and FFCA is attributed to the rapid, continuous 6e<sup>−</sup> oxidation process on Ag-Mn(OH)2-OV/NF, where intermediates are consumed faster than they can desorb and diffuse into the electrolyte. This is enabled by the catalyst's exceptionally strong adsorption of HMF/HMFCA/FFCA (Figure [3f;](#page-5-0) S21, Supporting Information), which accelerates their conversion to FDCA, coupled with enhanced adsorption of reactive OHads species that provide oxygen atoms for direct intermediate oxidation (Figure S22, Supporting Information). Furthermore, the shifted Mn 3d orbital energy toward the Fermi level (Figure [6g\)](#page-9-0) synchronizes intermediate oxidation with electrode charge transfer. This synergistic "strong adsorption-rapid transformation" mechanism minimizes intermediate accumulation while achieving 98.6% FDCA selectivity by suppressing side reactions. Since catalyst Ag-Mn(OH)2-OV/NF shows the most promising catalytic performance toward HMFOR, consecutive electrolysis was conducted at 1.4 V to assess its operational durability. As shown in Figure [4e,](#page-7-0) the system retained complete HMF conversion rate (100%) and sustained FE for FDCA between 96.33% and 98.60% throughout all six cycles, confirming exceptional catalytic stability in the HMFOR. Additionally, SEM and XRD analyses of the catalyst after long-term HM-FOR revealed no significant changes in its morphology and structure. Specifically, the catalyst retained the curved and deformed nanosheet array structure formed through electrochemical reconstruction, with no evident structural collapse or particle aggregation (Figure S31, Supporting Information). The XRD characterization further corroborated the catalyst's stability, as the post-reaction catalyst still exhibited characteristic diffraction peaks of Mn(OH)2 and Ag (Figure S32, Supporting Information), indicating that its primary phase structure remained stable after long-term reaction. These results collectively demonstrate the excellent structural stability of the Ag-Mn(OH)2- OV/NF catalyst. Moreover, compared to previously reported 3D porous conductive substrate-supported metal oxide/hydroxide catalysts for HMFOR, Ag-Mn(OH)2-OV/NF demonstrated excellent catalytic activity in HMFOR (Figure [4f;](#page-7-0) Table S2, Supporting Information).[\[42–48\]](#page-11-0)

#### **2.4. Catalytic Mechanistic Analysis**

In a CV activation for precursors MnMoO4/NF, the color of the anodic solution changed from transparent to purple was observed, and the purple color deepened with prolonged activation time (**Figures 5**[a;](#page-8-0) S33a,b, Supporting Information). This color change is highly likely to be caused by the dissolution of the MoO4 2−. [\[16\]](#page-11-0) To verify this guess, spectroscopic analysis of the purple solution using potassium thiocyanate and stannous chloride methods, as well as lead nitrate precipitation, was carried out, confirming the presence of MoO4 <sup>2</sup><sup>−</sup> and the color change originated from the leaching of MoO4 <sup>2</sup><sup>−</sup> (Figure S33c,d, Supporting Information). These results indicate that the CV activation triggers the leaching of MoO4 <sup>2</sup><sup>−</sup> species from MnMoO4/NF, driving its structural reconstruction into oxygen vacancy-rich Mn(OH)X-OV materials, thereby enhancing the catalytic activity. Figure [5b](#page-8-0) shows the LSV curves after different CV activation times. As can be seen, when the CV activation takes ≥10 min, the LSV curves are stabilized, indicating a saturated catalytic activity. As we discussed above, the Mo-related MoO3(H2O)2 species remained in the Mn(OH)X-OV after 10 min of activation. To see if the residual MoO3(H2O)2 acts as the catalytic sites or not, ICP-MS analysis of the time-dependent leaching process of MnMoO4/NF in 1 M KOH was conducted. As revealed in Figure [5c,](#page-8-0) the Mn: Mo atomic ratio shifts from 1:1 in the pristine material to 6:4 after 10 min of activation, followed by near-complete Mo depletion after 12 h. These findings clarify that MoO4 <sup>2</sup><sup>−</sup> leaching primarily facilitates structural reorganization rather than directly

enhancing catalytic performance. The dissolution of  $MoO_4^{2-}$  disrupts the  $MnMoO_4$  lattice, promoting  $O_V$  formation through lattice oxygen escape, as quantified by XPS (Figure 2c). Furthermore, the activation environment promotes the oxidation of  $Mn^{2+}$  to more active  $Mn^{3+}$  species, ultimately generating  $Mn(OH)_2\text{-}O_V/NF$  with optimized electrocatalytic activity. This mechanism aligns with the known high solubility of Mo species in alkaline media,[49] emphasizing the importance of transient structural modulation in electrocatalyst design. Based on the above structural evolution process, the final catalyst consists of Ag, the main phase of  $Mn(OH)_2$ , and a small amount of residual  $MoO_3(H_2O)_2$ . Although there is residual  $MoO_3(H_2O)_2$ , its impact on catalytic performance is negligible, hence the catalyst is named Ag- $Mn(OH)_2$ - $O_V/NF$  to highlight its dominant active structure.

To further elucidate the catalyst composition-reactivity correlations, we conducted operando Raman spectroscopy to monitor the valence state transitions on Ag-Mn(OH)<sub>2</sub>-O<sub>V</sub>/NF under operational OER and HMFOR conditions across applied potentials.

As shown in Figure 5d, the two peaks observed at 585 and 670 cm<sup>-1</sup> (from OCP to 1.4 V) are characteristic of mixed Mn<sup>2+</sup> and Mn<sup>3+</sup> species in Mn(OH)<sub>2</sub>, exhibiting a peak profile similar to that of Mn<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (Hausmannite).<sup>[50,51]</sup> Upon applying a higher potential (>1.5 V vs RHE), more Mn<sup>2+</sup> species oxidize to Mn<sup>3+</sup>, simultaneously forming MnOOH compounds under alkaline conditions. Consequently, the characteristic Raman peaks shift to 570 and 630 cm $^{-1}$ .[52-55] In contrast, these peaks at 630 cm $^{-1}$ were not observed until the potential reached 1.7 V under the HMFOR condition (Figure 5e). The delayed emergence of Mn<sup>3+</sup> spectral signatures demonstrates a potential-dependent kinetic competition between Mn<sup>3+</sup> generation and consumption mechanisms. At a potential less than 1.7 V, the generated Mn3+ undergoes immediate oxidative consumption via spontaneous redox interaction with HMF, definitively establishing Mn<sup>3+</sup> as the active catalytic phase governing HMFOR kinetics. These results can also be verified by a multi-step potentiostatic analysis. As shown in Figure 5f, the initial polarization in 1 m KOH at 1.5 V for 60 s induced progressive accumulation of high valence Mn<sup>3+</sup>

species in Ag-Mn(OH)2-OV/NF (blue line). After switching to OCP for 60 s, a pronounced cathodic reductive concurrent (−9.38 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2) appeared at 120 s when re-polarization to a more reductive potential of 0.7 V, corresponding to the electrochemical reduction of Mn<sup>3</sup><sup>+</sup> to Mn<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> species. Strikingly, the presence of HMF almost suppressed this reduction signal (green line), revealing instantaneous redox coupling between accumulated Mn<sup>3</sup><sup>+</sup> and HMF before charge transfer detection, corroborated by operando Raman analysis. Based on these findings, we propose that the HMFOR on Ag-Mn(OH)2-OV is predominantly governed by an electrochemical-chemical (E-C) mechanism. Specifically, HMFOR involves two consecutive electron transfer processes: Initially, Mn<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup>-OH is oxidized to Mn3<sup>+</sup>-O through electrochemical means; subsequently, the catalytic mediator Mn<sup>3</sup><sup>+</sup>- O undergoes a chemical reduction by extracting protons and electrons from HMF, thereby driving the oxidation of HMF (Figure [5g\)](#page-8-0).

#### **2.5. Density Functional Theory Calculations**

To elucidate the exceptional catalytic performance of the catalyst Ag-Mn(OH)2-OV /NF and unravel its reaction pathways in the HMFOR, we conducted density functional theory (DFT) calculations.[\[55–57\]](#page-11-0) Three material models, such as MnOOH(010), OV-incorporated MnOOH(010) (MnOOH-OV), and Ag(200) nanoparticles-decorated MnOOH(010)-OV (Ag-MnOOH-OV), were constructed based on the experimentally validated structural features and employed in computational analyses (**Figure 6**a).[\[1\]](#page-11-0) At first, the adsorption configurations of

HMF and OHads on the surfaces of MnOOH, MnOOH-OV, and Ag-MnOOH-OV were modeled and optimized (Figures S34–S37, Supporting Information).[\[36\]](#page-11-0) As demonstrated in Figure [6b,](#page-9-0) vertical adsorption of HMF through the C═O group on pristine MnOOH requires an energy input of 0.95 eV, whereas spontaneous horizontal adsorption configurations dominate on modified surfaces, with binding energies of −0.87 eV for MnOOH-OV and −1.1 eV for Ag-MnOOH-OV. Notably, vertically oriented OHads configurations were identified on all three catalyst surfaces (Figure [6c\)](#page-9-0), though with significant variations in adsorption energetics. The calculated adsorption energies followed the trend: MnOOH (0.72 eV) *>* MnOOH-OV (0.64 eV) *>* Ag-MnOOH-OV (−0.05 eV). The reduced adsorption energies highlight the critical role of structural modifications (OV introduction and Ag incorporation) in enhancing the catalyst's adsorption capacity for HMF and OHads, with Ag-MnOOH-OV exhibiting the most thermodynamically favorable HMF and OHads adsorption, thereby promoting the combination of reactants with OHads and improving the thermodynamics of the reaction.

Then, the projected density of states (DOS) was also analyzed for MnOOH, MnOOH-OV, and Ag-MnOOH-OV. As shown in Figure [6d–f,](#page-9-0) the MnOOH model exhibits typical semiconductor characteristics with a bandgap of 0.70 eV. In contrast, both MnOOH-OV and Ag-MnOOH-OV models with oxygen vacancies display gapless features. This suggests that the incorporation of oxygen vacancies significantly enhances the material's conductivity, facilitating rapid electron transfer during the electrocatalytic process. Further analysis reveals that the total DOS of Ag-MnOOH-OV is positively shifted compared to the other two materials, with its d-band center closer to the Fermi level (Ef) (Figure [6g\)](#page-9-0). This shift increases the electron filling level and significantly enhances the total DOS near the Fermi level, thereby accelerating the reaction kinetics. These results indicate that a higher electron flux can be maintained during the HMF oxidation process, effectively preventing the accumulation of HMFCA and FFCA and further enhancing the selectivity of FDCA. This is highly consistent with the experimental observations of HMF electrocatalysis discussed above, further confirming the significant improvement in catalytic performance due to the introduction of oxygen vacancies and Ag doping, especially in terms of increasing FDCA selectivity and reducing side reaction pathways.

Subsequent energy profile calculations elucidated the distinct reaction pathways for HMF oxidation on MnOOH versus Ag-MnOOH-OV surfaces (Figure [6h,i\)](#page-9-0). Notably, the adsorption of HMF on Ag-MnOOH-OV is spontaneous with a total energy of −0.26 eV, which contrasts sharply with the endothermic adsorption requiring 1.79 eV on pristine MnOOH. This substantial energy difference aligns with electrochemical observations, confirming that dual modification with Ag and OV significantly enhances HMF adsorption. After the successful adsorption of HMF, the free energy for the \*HMF to \*HMFCA pathway on MnOOH is uphill, with an energy change of 0.22 eV, making it the rate-determining step (RDS). In contrast, the Ag-MnOOH-OV catalyst reduces this energy barrier to 0.01 eV, underscoring the synergistic effect of Ag and OV co-decoration. In the subsequent two steps, both MnOOH and Ag-MnOOH-OV exhibit a downhill trend for HMFCA to FFCA and an uphill trend for the FFCA to FDCA pathway. However, the required energy for the final FDCA formation step on the Ag-MnOOH-OV is 0.25 eV which is higher than that of MnOOH (0.09 eV), establishing this reaction pathway as the RDS for the Ag-MnOOH-OV. Overall, the calculations indicate that the incorporation of Ag and OV into the Ag-MnOOH-OV endows it with a stronger exothermic nature in the HMFOR, thereby exhibiting superior HMFOR performance. Furthermore, comparative pathway analysis reveals that HMF oxidation on both MnOOH-OV and Ag-MnOOH-OV is more likely to follow the HMFCA pathway over the DFF route, owing to its greater thermodynamic favorability, consistent with experimental observations.

## **3. Conclusion**

In this work, we developed a synergistic strategy combining electrochemical activation-induced MoO4 <sup>2</sup><sup>−</sup> leaching with Ag nanoparticle decoration to engineer an advanced Ag-Mn(OH)2- OV/NF electrocatalyst based on pre-synthesized MnMoO4/NF nanosheets. The obtained catalyst Ag-Mn(OH)2-OV/NF demonstrated remarkable catalytic performance for the HMFOR, achieving complete HMF conversion rate at 1.40 V versus. RHE with a current density of 48.50 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> and an exceptional 98.60% FE for FDCA production, which is much higher than the pristine Mn(OH)2-OV/NF counterpart. Through integrated spectroscopic characterization and DFT computational analysis, the mechanisms underlying the outstanding HMFOR performance over Ag-Mn(OH)2-OV/NF were elucidated. The CV activationinduced MoO4 <sup>2</sup><sup>−</sup> leaching and Ag nanoparticles decoration collaboratively lead to an OV-enriched Ag-Mn(OH)2-OV/NF, thereby facilitating the formation of abundant Mn<sup>3</sup><sup>+</sup>-O active sites. Moreover, the introduced Ag nanoparticles substantially improved both charge transfer kinetics and reactant (HMF and OH<sup>−</sup>) adsorption capacity. These factors collectively modulate the electronic structure and microenvironment, accelerating the conversion of HMF and enhancing the selective formation of FDCA. This work presents a multi-scale synergistic optimization strategy that effectively overcomes the significant challenges of low conductivity and metastable active sites in Mn-based catalysts, successfully unlocking their potential for HMF electrocatalytic oxidation while achieving exceptional catalytic efficiency and operational stability. Our findings offer new insights into the rational development of efficient electrocatalytic systems for biomass valorization and sustainable chemical synthesis.

Water electrolysis for hydrogen production consumes abundant electronic energy owing to the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER), so the integration of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with thermodynamically more favorable oxidation reactions is a promising strategy for energy-efficient hydrogen production. Herein, we propose the epitaxial confinement of rhodium nanoparticles (NPs) to palladium metallene (Rh/Pd metallene) for hydrogen production assisted by the hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR). The two-dimensional structure of Rh/Pd metallene provides sufficient active sites as well as a rapid charge transfer rate. The interface of Pd metallene with Rh NPs ensembles to modulate the electronic state, thus optimizing the adsorption energy of reaction intermediates. The Rh/Pd metallene exhibits splendid HER and HzOR activities, with overpotentials of 59 and 7 mV at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, respectively. In the two-electrode construction of a hydrazine oxidation-assisted water splitting system, the Rh/Pd metallene only needs a low overpotential of 0.19 V to produce hydrogen at a current density of 100 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. This research offers a viable approach for designing nanosheet/nanoparticle heterojunction as an attractive modular platform for energy-saving hydrogen production.

# Introduction

Hydrogen, as a clean and high-energy-density energy source, has received widespread interest. 1-3 Among various methods for hydrogen production, water electrolysis is considered to be one of the most effective methods. 4-8 However, this method should consume copious electronic energy because of sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER,  $4OH^- \rightarrow O^2 + 2H_2O + 4e^-$ , 1.23 V), limiting its extensive application.9-11 It has been reported that replacing OER with thermodynamically more favorable oxidation reactions of small molecules (e.g. alcohols, sulfide, and hydrazine) can effectively save energy to produce hydrogen. 12-14 Among them, the hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR, N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> +  $4OH^- \rightarrow N_2 + 4H_2O + 4e^-, -0.33 \text{ V}$ ) is a promising candidate due to the ultralow oxidation potential and safe production of  $N_2$ . Therefore, the integration of HzOR with HER is a viable strategy for hydrogen production with low energy consumption and safety.18-20 To this end, designing excellent bifunctional catalysts with high activity is of great importance.

Although palladium-based materials have been demonstrated to be excellent electrocatalysts for HzOR and HER, 21,22

there is still a large room for the improvement of their performance. An effective means of improving the catalytic performance is the adjustment of material morphology.23-25 Twodimensional (2D) materials have high charge mobility, large active surface area, modifiable electronic property, and strong mechanical flexibility, which have received abundant attention in electrocatalytic fields.26-28 Most recently, metallene consisting of atomically thin metals with rich under-coordinated atoms has been reported to provide sufficient catalytic activity centers and fast charge passage.29-33 Moreover, heterointerface engineering is also considered an effective strategy to enhance catalytic performance.34-36 The heterointerface construction enables the strong coupling effect to induce the re-distribution of the charge density and tailor the electronic structure, thereby optimizing the surface adsorption and reducing the reaction energy barrier.37-40 Rhodium with good corrosion resistance and resistance to toxicity is widely used in both HER and HzOR. 41-43 Therefore, the design of Rh/Pd heterogeneous interface structure is highly desired to effectively improve the catalytic performance.

In this work, we confine Rh nanoparticles (NPs) to Pd metallene to design the Rh/Pd interface structure (Rh/Pd metallene). The ultra-thin 2D structure and the interfacial structure of Rh/Pd metallene can provide sufficient active centers, optimize the electronic state, and promote electron transfer. Therefore, Rh/Pd metallene possessed low overpotentials of 59 and 7 mV to drive HER and HzOR at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, respectively. In the overall

hydrazine splitting (OHzS) system, Rh/Pd metallene achieves a high current density of 100 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> for hydrogen production at a low cell voltage of 0.19 V that noticeably outperforms conventional overall water splitting of 2.12 V. This work extends a promising approach for designing 0D/2D heterointerface structures towards energy-efficient hydrogen production.

# **Experimental**

#### Materials and chemicals

Palladium(II) acetylacetonate (Pd(acac)2, 99.0%) and Nafion solution (5 wt%) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Rhodium(III) chloride hydrate (RhCl<sub>3</sub>·xH<sub>2</sub>O, Rh: 38-40%), ruthenium( $_{\text{IV}}$ ) oxide (99.9%), potassium hydroxide ( $\sim$ 85%), ethylene glycol (>99.0%), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, 99.5%), acetic acid (99.5%), isopropanol (99.5%), hydrazine monohydrate (50%) and absolute ethanol were purchased from Aladdin. Tungsten hexacarbonyl (~97%) was purchased from Maclean. Commercial Pt/C (20 wt%) was supplied on order from Alfa Aesar.

#### **Preparation of catalysts**

The Pd metallene was first synthesized by a solvothermal method using previous work.44 First, 10 mg of Pd(acac)2 and 20 mg of W(CO)<sub>6</sub> were ultrasonically dissolved in 8 mL of DMF, followed by adding 2 mL of acetic acid, which was heated to 50  $^{\circ}$ C and reacted for 1 h. The black solution after the reaction was collected and washed several times with ethanol for further use. For the synthesis of Rh/Pd metallene, the above synthesized Pd metallene sample was dispersed in 7.5 mL of ethylene glycol under sonication. Then, 7.5 mL RhCl<sub>3</sub> (0.8 mM) was added to the mixed solution, which was sonicated homogeneously and transferred into a polytetrafluoroethylene-lined reactor and reacted at 180 °C for 2 h. Finally, the product was obtained after washing and centrifugation with ethanol for five cycles. For comparison, control samples were prepared from different amounts of RhCl3 (3.0 and 12 mL) under similar conditions, which were denoted as L-Rh/Pd metallene, H-Rh/Pd metallene. In addition, we synthesized Rh NPs under similar conditions without the addition of Pd metallene.

#### Characterizations

The morphology and structure of the synthesized catalyst were visualized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-2100), scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Zeiss Gemini 500), and atomic force microscopy (AFM, MFP-3D Infinity). X-ray diffraction (XRD, Ultima IV) patterns were recorded with a PANalytical Empyrean powder diffractometer using Cu Ka radiation ( $\lambda = 0.1541$  nm) at 40 kV and 40 mA, which was used to test the crystal structure of materials. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, K-Alpha, Thermo Scientific) was used to characterize the electronic structure of catalysts.

#### **Electrochemical measurements**

Electrochemical tests of HER and HzOR were performed by an electrochemical workstation (CHI 660E) using a three-electrode

system, with a catalyst-wrapped glassy carbon electrode (GCE) as the working electrode, Hg/HgO electrode as the reference electrode, and carbon rod as the counter electrode. The working electrode was obtained by coating 10 µg of catalyst ink (dispersing 2 mg of catalysts in 750 µL of deionized water, 200 μL of isopropanol, and 50 μL of Nafion (0.5 wt%) solution) on the polished GCE. For two-electrode measurements, a working electrode was produced by dropping 0.5 mL of ink onto carbon paper (1.0  $\times$  1.0 cm). All linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves were conducted at a sweep rate of 5.0 mV s<sup>-1</sup>. All potentials were switched to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE,  $E_{RHE} = E_{Hg/}$  $_{\rm HgO}$  + 0.059  $\times$  pH + 0.098). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was recorded from 100 kHz to 0.1 Hz with an amplitude of 5 mV. The electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) was determined by CO stripping experiments in 1.0 M N<sub>2</sub>-saturated KOH solution with a scan rate of 100 mV s<sup>-1</sup> over a potential range of 0 to 1.2 V. The ECSA of various catalysts is computed according to the equation (ECSA =  $Q/(m \times C)$ ), in which the Q represents the charge in the oxidation region for the adsorbed CO, m is the loading of the precious metal, and C (420 μC cm<sup>-2</sup>) is the required charge for the monolayer adsorption of CO on the precious metal surface. The Faraday efficiency of the generated H2 was measured in an H-type electrolytic cell by a drained gas collection method. The Faraday efficiency (FE) of the H2 of the catalyst was calculated according to the formula (FE<sub>H<sub>2</sub></sub> =  $(N_{H_2} \times Z \times F/Q) \times 100\%$ ), where N is the molar amount of the produced hydrogen, Z is the number of transferred electrons for hydrogen production, F is the Faraday constant (96 485 C  $\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$ ), and Q is the total charge during the whole electrolysis.

# Results and discussion

The two-step synthesis process of Rh/Pd metallene with a heterogeneous interface structure is shown in Fig. 1. During the formation of Pd metallene, the CO generated from the thermal decomposition of W(CO)6 serves as reducing and capping agents to facilitate the lateral growth of Pd crystals. It can be clearly observed that Pd metallene is a highly curved nanosheet structure and has an ultrathin thickness of about 1.1 nm (Fig. S1†). Then, Rh precursors are adsorbed onto Pd metallence due to their strong interaction and reduced to Rh NPs via the solvothermal method using ethylene glycol as a reducing agent.

The ultrathin two-dimensional nanostructure of the synthesized Rh/Pd metallene heterojunction material was clearly visualized by TEM and the high-angle annular dark-field

scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) (Fig. 2a and b). Fig. 2c and d clearly demonstrate the uniform dispersion of Rh NPs with a particle size of about 3.6 nm on Pd metallene. As a comparative example, agglomerated Rh NPs are formed in the lack of Pd metallene (Fig. S2†), demonstrating that the strong interaction makes Rh NPs more evenly distributed on Pd metallene. As illustrated in the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image (Fig. 2e), the lattice spacing of 0.232 nm can be attributed to the Pd (111) crystal plane of the sample, which is slightly expanded compared to the standard lattice spacing of Pd (111) plane (0.225 nm) due to the highly curved sheet structure and the strong interaction between Pd and Rh.44 The lattice spacing of 0.220 nm is attributed to the Rh (111) plane of the sample. The synthesized Rh/Pd metallene contains both Pd and Rh elements illustrated by HAADF-STEM image and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) mapping images, with an atomic Rh/Pd ratio of 26/74 (Fig. 2f and S3†). For comparison, the samples with different Rh contents epitaxially confined to Pd metallene were also studied. The TEM images show that L-Rh/Pd metallene has fewer Rh NPs on Pd metallene and H-Rh/Pd metallene possesses more aggregated Rh NPs on Pd metallene; meanwhile, the size of Rh NPs on Pd metallene gradually increases with the increase of Rh amount (Fig. S4†). In addition, the EDX mapping images show the atomic ratios of Rh/Pd (11/89 and 36/64) for L-Rh/Pd metallene and H-Rh/Pd metallene, respectively (Fig. S5†).

The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns show that Pd metallene only has a strong diffraction peak at 40.00° (Fig. 3a), corresponding to the (111) plane of Pd (JCPDS-46-1043), which suggests the ill-developed crystal structure. Compared to the standard baseline for Pd, there is a small negative shift due to the strain effect of the Pd metallene. There is no significant shift in the XRD peaks of the Rh/Pd metallene compared to pure Pd metallene, indicating that the Rh/Pd metallene is not an alloy

phase but a heterogeneous phase. Moreover, no other distinct diffraction peaks are observed in the XRD pattern of Rh/Pd metallene due to the low crystalline nature of the Rh NPs (Fig. S6†). As indicated in Fig. 3b, the elemental composition of Rh/Pd metallene was confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). In the high-definition XPS Pd 3d spectrum, the intense peaks at 340.9 and 335.7 eV correspond to Pd (0) 3d<sub>3/2</sub> and 3d<sub>5/2</sub> orbitals of Rh/Pd metallene, and two minor peaks at 342.3 and 336.8 eV are ascribed to Pd(II) (Fig. 3c), indicating the predominant presence of metallic Pd in Rh/Pd metallene.45 Moreover, the Rh/Pd metallene shows significant positive shifts of the Pd 3d XPS peaks compared with Pd metallene, indicating the electron transfer from Pd to Rh, which can weaken the hydrogen adsorption energy on Pd. 46 The XPS Rh 3d spectrum of Rh/Pd metallene exhibits that the two strong peaks at 312.2 and 307.4 eV are attributed to metallic Rh while two weak peaks at 313.4 and 308.6 eV are ascribed to Rh(III) (Fig. 3d).47 The significant positive shifts in the Rh 3d XPS spectrum are due to the electron transfer from Rh to O, facilitating the adsorption of the reactant molecules on electron-deficient Rh active sites. 36,48

In a typical three-electrode system, we performed HER performance tests of samples in 1 M KOH. The LSV curves display that Pd metallene and Rh/Pd metallene show an obvious hydrogen adsorption peak (Fig. 4a). The overpotential of Rh/Pd metallene (59 mV) is lower than that of Rh NPs (69 mV) and Pd metallene (320 mV) at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, revealing the superior HER activity of Rh/Pd metallene due to the increased active sites and optimized hydrogen adsorption energy barrier. The electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) was then evaluated from CO stripping experiments, in which the ECSA of Rh/Pd metallene (62.7 m $^2$  g $^{-1}$ ) is higher than that of Rh NPs (25.8 m $^2$  g $^{-1}$ ) and Pd metallene (48.8 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>) (Fig. S7†), revealing that the introduction of Rh NPs on the Pd metallene results in the increased active sites. Fig. 4b shows the Tafel slopes for different catalysts. The Rh/Pd metallene has a lower Tafel slope  $(86.7 \text{ mV dec}^{-1})$  than that of Rh NPs  $(99.2 \text{ mV dec}^{-1})$  and Pd

metallene (240.5 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>), reflecting the excellent HER kinetic properties of Rh/Pd metallene. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was further performed to characterize the HER performance of the catalysts (Fig. 4c). The charge transfer resistance of Rh/Pd metallene is lower than that of other comparison samples, indicating a faster charge transfer speed due to the ultrathin curved structure of Pd metallene and the rapid transfer of bridging charges between the Rh NPs and the Pd metallene carriers. In addition, HER measurements of L-Rh/ Pd metallene and H-Rh/Pd metallene were also performed, showing the better HER performance of Rh/Pd metallene (Fig. S8a†). To further explore their differences, we calculated the ECSA of samples (Fig. S8b-d†). The results show that the ECSA of L-Rh/Pd metallene (53.2 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>) and H-Rh/Pd metallene (46.1 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>) is lower than that of Rh/Pd metallene because L-Rh/Pd metallene with less Rh NPs only provides limited active sites, while H-Rh/Pd metallene with aggregated Rh NPs on the surface reduces the active areas. Additionally, the cyclic voltammetry (CV) and chronopotentiometry (V-t) tests were performed to assess the material stability (Fig. 4d). After 2500 CV cycles, the initial LSV curve almost coincides with the post-LSV curve. The V-t curve displays no apparent decay after electrolysis at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> for 20 h. These results indicate that Rh/Pd metallene has good HER stability.

HzOR performance tests of different samples were further conducted in 1 M KOH + 0.1 M N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> (Fig. 5a). The LSV curves show that the Rh/Pd metallene only needs 7 mV to drive achieve HzOR at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, better than Rh NPs (15 mV) and Pd metallene (198 mV). The overpotential of the HzOR is much lower than that of the OER (Fig. S9†), indicating that replacing the OER with HzOR at the anode is a viable method for reducing energy consumption. Moreover, the Tafel slope of Rh/Pd metallene (6.19 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>) is smaller than that of Rh NPs (8.66 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>) and Pd metallene (55.5 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>) (Fig. 5b), demonstrating that the Rh/Pd metallene undergoes more favorable

HzOR kinetics, which is also supported by the EIS analyses (Fig. 5c). Finally, the CV cycling stability and V-t stability of Rh/ Pd metallene were studied (Fig. 5d). After 2500 CV cycles, the LSV curve overlaps with the original LSV curve, and the V-t curve performed at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> for 20 h shows no apparent decay, indicating that Rh/Pd metallene has good stability for HzOR. For comparison, the HzOR performance of L-Rh/Pd metallene and H-Rh/Pd metallene is also significantly poorer than Rh/Pd metallene due to the decreased active sites (Fig. S10†).

For two-electrode measurements, the OHzS was performed in 1 M KOH + 0.1 M N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>. The LSV curves exhibit that the Rh/Pd metallene only requires 0.05 and 0.19 V for hydrogen production at 10 and 100 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, respectively (Fig. 6a), far below overall water splitting (1.687 and 2.12 V). Furthermore, the

OHzS performance is much better than that of the commercial two-electrode Pt/C||RuO2 system (Fig. 6b), which also outperforms many systems reported in the literature (Table S1†). Moreover, the experimentally measured H<sub>2</sub> is in general agreement with the theoretically calculated value, with the Faraday efficiency of close to 100% for H<sub>2</sub> generation (Fig. S11†). For comparison, we tested the OHzS properties of different Rh NPs bound on Pd metallene (Fig. 6c). The L-Rh/Pd metallene and H-Rh/Pd metallene have higher cell voltages for OHzS than Rh/Pd metallene due to their reduced active sites. Finally, we conducted chronopotentiometry measurement to estimate the stability of the two-electrode system for 25 h (Fig. 6d), which exhibits no significant decay. The TEM image shows that the Rh/Pd metallene material retaines its previous morphology (Fig. S12†). These results reveal the excellent stability of Rh/Pd metallene due to the two-dimensional ultrathin metalene structure and strong interaction between Rh and Pd, leading to good electrochemical and structural stability.

The excellent performance of Rh/Pd metallene for hydrazine oxidation-assisted energy-saving hydrogen production can be attributed to the highly curved nanosheet structure and strong interaction between Pd and Rh. On the one hand, the epitaxial growth of Rh NPs on a two-dimensional Pd structure can provide abundant active sites and promote the rapid transfer of charge. On the other hand, the heterojunction surface constructed by Rh NPs and Pd metallene can regulate the electronic structure and optimize the adsorption energy of the reaction intermediates on catalysts, leading to enhanced performance. Finally, the construction of the 0D/2D heterojunction can also inhibit the catalyst aggregation, enhancing stability.

# Conclusions

In summary, we succeed in heterointerface engineering of the epitaxial confinement of Rh nanoparticles to Pd metallene for energy-saving hydrogen production. Due to its unique two-dimensional structure and the synergistic effect, the Rh/Pd metallene possesses abundant electrochemically active centers, outstanding mass transfer/diffusion rate, and strong electronic structure, which possesses superior activity for HER and HzOR, with overpotentials of 59 and 7 mV at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, respectively. In the two-electrode system, the Rh/Pd metallene requires an ultralow voltage of 0.19 V for hydrogen production at 100 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, significantly superior to water splitting (2.12 V). This study offers a viable tactic for designing 0D/2D heterojunction electrocatalysts for energy-saving hydrogen production assisted by the hydrazine oxygen reaction.

### **Abstract**

In this communication, we report the development of cobalt phosphide nanoarray as an efficient and stable catalyst for hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) in alkaline media. Its high hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity enables it a bifunctional catalyst for less energy-intensive electrolytic hydrogen generation by replacing sluggish oxygen evolution reaction with HzOR. The corresponding two-electrode electrolyzer using such nanoarray as both anode for HzOR and cathode for HER only needs a cell voltage of 0.2 V to drive 10 mA cm-2 in 1.0 M KOH with 100 mM hydrazine, 1.45 V less than that for pure water splitting. This electrolyzer also shows strong long-term electrochemical durability with nearly 100% Faradic efficiency for hydrogen evolution.

#### **1. Introduction**

The depletion of fossil fuels and increased environmental concerns have triggered an urgent need for clean and sustainable alternative energy sources. [1,2] Hydrogen has been regarded as an ideal clean energy resource to replace fossil fuel. Water electrolysis converts electricity produced from intermittent renewable energy resources (such as solar energy, wind, wave power) into chemical energy stored by hydrogen fuel. [3] Water splitting includes two half reactions: anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). [3-5] Compared to HER, OER involves multiple steps of proton-coupled electron transfer with sluggish kinetics and high activation energy barrier for O-O bond formation, remaining the major bottle-neck in water splitting process. [6,7] Fortunately, anodic water oxidation can be replaced with the oxidation of other more readily oxidizable species for more energy-efficient electrolytic hydrogen production. [8]

Hydrazine oxidation (N2H<sup>4</sup> + 4OH- → N<sup>2</sup> + 4H2O + 4e- with *E 0* of -0.38 V) proceeds more easily than water oxidation with *E 0* of +1.23 V, [9] offering an ideal alternative to OER for less energy-intensive electrochemical hydrogen production. So far, various catalysts for HzOR have been developed. [10-24] As an interstitial alloy, cobalt phosphide (CoP) has good electrical conductivity with high HER activity, [25-31] but catalytic activity toward HzOR electrocatalysis remains unexplored so far.

In this communication, we demonstrate that CoP nanoarray on Ti mesh (CoP/TiM) behaves as an efficient and stable catalyst for HzOR in alkaline media, with the need of potential of -6 mV to achieve 100 mA cm-2 in 1.0 M KOH with 100 mM hydrazine. A two-electrode electrolyzer using CoP/TiM as both anode for HzOR and cathode for HER requires a cell voltage of only 0.2 V to drive 10 mA cm-2 in 1.0 M KOH with 100 mM hydrazine, 1.45 V less compared with pure water splitting. It also demonstrates remarkable long-term electrochemical durability with nearly 100% Faradic efficiency (FE) for hydrogen evolution.

#### **2. Experimental**

#### *2.1 Reagents and materials*

Co(NO3)2·6H2O, NH4F, NaH2PO2, and urea were purchased from Tianjin Fuyu Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. (China). Pt/C (20 wt% Pt on Vulcan XC-72R) was purchased from Alfa Aesar (China). Ti mesh was provided by Baoji Yunjie Metal Production Co. Ltd. (China). All chemicals were used as received without further purification. The water used throughout all experiments was purified through a Millipore system.

#### *2.2 Preparation of CoP/TiM*

A piece of Ti mesh (2 cm × 3 cm) was carefully pre-treated with concentrated HCl for 15 min to remove the impurity, and then cleaned by deionized water and ethanol. To prepare Co(OH)F/TiM, a solution was made by sonicating the mixture of 1 mmol Co(NO3)2·6H2O, 2 mmol NH4F, and 5 mmol urea in 30 mL water to form a uniform solution. Then the solution was transferred to a 50 mL teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave, into which the pre-treated Ti mesh was immersed. The autoclave was sealed and maintained at 105°C for 5 h in an electric oven. After the autoclave was cooled down to room temperature, the resulting Co(OH)F/TiM was taken out and washed with water and ethanol several times, followed by drying at 60 ºC for 12 h. To prepare CoP/TiM, Co(OH)F/TiM was placed in the hot center of a tube furnace and a porcelain boat containing 300 mg of NaH2PO<sup>2</sup> was placed at the farthest upstream position within the tube furnace. Subsequently, the porcelain boat was heated at 300 °C for 2 h with a heating speed of 2 °C min-1 in Ar atmosphere, then naturally cooled down to ambient temperature. The loading for CoP on Ti mesh was determined to be 0.7 mg cm-2 .

#### *2.3 Characterization*

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurements were performed on a XL30 ESEM FEG scanning electron microscope at an accelerating voltage of 20 kV. Powder X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) data of the samples were collected on Bruker D8 ADVANCE Diffractiometer (λ=1.5418 Å). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements were performed on a HITACHI H-8100 electron microscopy (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan) with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data were acquired on a Thermal ESCALAB 250 spectrometer using an Al Kα X-ray source (1486.6 eV photons).

#### *2.4 Electrochemical measurements*

A conventional three-electrode system was used throughout the electrochemical experiment with a CHI-760D electrochemical workstation (CHI Instruments, Shanghai, China) at room temperature. The as-prepared Ti mesh-based electrodes were served as the working electrodes. A graphite plate and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) were used as the auxiliary and reference electrodes, respectively. In all measurements, the SCE reference electrode was calibrated with respect to reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) in 1.0 M KOH. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) measurements were conducted in 1.0 M KOH with a scan rate of 5 mV s-1 . E (RHE) = E (SCE) + 1.068 V. For two electrode electrolysis, CoP/TiMs were employed as both anode and cathode with a cation exchange membrane (Zhejiang Qianqiu Group Co., Ltd., China.) and an electrochemical workstation were connected in series.

#### *2.5 Fe determination*

The generated gas was confirmed by gas chromatography analysis and measured quantitatively using a calibrated pressure sensor to monitor the pressure change in the cathode compartment of an H-type electrolytic cell. FE was calculated by comparing the amount of measured hydrogen generated by galvanostatic electrolysis with calculated hydrogen based on passed charge.

#### **3. Results and discussion**

CoP/TiM was derived from Co(OH)F/TiM via well-established low-temperature phosphidation reaction. [25] XRD analysis for blank TiM and CoP/TiM (Figure 1a)

shows the formation of orthorhombic CoP (JCPDS No. 29-0497). The SEM images indicate that TiM (Figure S1) was fully covered with Co(OH)F nanoarray (Figure 1b) after hydrothermal treatment. The high-magnification SEM image (Figure 1c) reveals that these nanowires grow vertically on TiM. The resulting CoP still maintains its nanoarray feature (Figure 1d). The energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectrum shows the product has a Co:P atomic ratio of 1:1, as shown in Figure S2. Figure 1e shows the SEM image and corresponding EDX elemental mapping analysis of Co and P for CoP/TiM, revealing the uniform distribution of Co and P elements. The TEM image for one single CoP nanowire suggests it has a diameter about 100 nm with rough surface texture (Figure 1f). The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image taken from the nanowire shows well-resolved lattice fringe with an interplanar distance of 0.28 nm indexed to the (011) plane of CoP. [25] The XPS spectrum in the Co 2p region (Figure 1h) exhibits three peaks and the peaks at 778.6 and 793.5 eV correspond to Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2, respectively. [25,29] For the P 2p spectrum (Figure 1i), the peaks at 128.6 and 129.4 eV reflect the binding energies of P 2p3/2 and P 2p1/2, respectively. [25,29] The peaks at 133.3 and 780.6 eV are assigned to oxidized P and Co species arising from superficial oxidation of CoP due to air exposure. [25,27,32]

We examined the electrocatalytic HzOR activity of CoP/TiM (CoP loading: 0.7 mg cm-2 ) in a typical three-electrode setup with a scan rate of 5 mV s-1 . The ohmic potential drop losses from the solution resistance were applied to all initial data[33] and all potentials were reported on a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale. Figure 2a shows the LSV curves of CoP/TiM toward different concentrations of hydrazine. There is no obvious response for solution without hydrazine. In contrast, the presence of 20 mM hydrazine leads to a sharp rise in anodic current and increased hydrazine concentration causes further increased current density. Figure 2b compares the electrocatalytic HzOR performances of bare TiM, Co(OH)F/TiM, CoP/TiM, and Pt/C on TiM with the same loading (Pt/C/TiM). Both bare TiM and Co(OH)F/TiM show negligible HzOR activity in the measurement potential range. Remarkably, CoP/TiM presents high HzOR activity and it only demands a low potential of -6 mV to drive 100 mA cm-2 , which is even much lower than that of Pt/C/TiM. It also compares favorably to the behaviors of other HzOR catalysts in alkaline media (Table S1). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements (Figure 2c) demonstrate that CoP/TiM has a much lower impedance and thus markedly faster HzOR kinetics. [34,35] Figure 2d shows the multi-step chronopotentiometric curve for CoP/TiM with anodic current density increasing from 0 to 550 mA cm-2 . The potential immediately levels off at -50 mV at the start current value and remains unchanged for the rest 300 s and the other steps also give similar results, demonstrating the excellent conductivity, and mechanical robustness of this catalyst electrode. [36,37] A 10000 s long-term electrochemical electrolysis (at a constant current density of 150 mA cm-2 ) further manifests the superior durability of CoP/TiM towards HzOR (Figure 2e). XRD analysis for CoP/TiM after HzOR electrolysis (Figure 2f) reveals that such nanoarray is still CoP in nature.

We compared the catalytic performances of CoP/TiM electrode for OER and HzOR using a three-electrode system (Figure 3a). Without hydrazine, CoP/TiM exhibits a catalytic onset potential of ~ 1.55 V, while upon the addition of 100 mM hydrazine, the onset potential shifts to -0.05 V with a rapid current density rise. In addition, to achieve 100 mA cm-2 , the potential for HzOR is 1.56 V lower than that for OER. All these observations indicate that the oxidation of hydrazine is significantly easier than OER. To successfully couple HER and HzOR for energy-efficient hydrogen production, the CoP/TiM should maintain its HER performance in the presence of hydrazine due to the inevitable potential permeation of hydrazine across the membrane from the anode compartment to the cathode site. As shown in Figure 3b, the LSV curves of CoP/TiM in 1.0 M KOH before and after the addition of 100 mM hydrazine only exhibit a small cathodic shift of 14 mV to drive 100 mA cm-2 . The durability of this electrode for HzOR and HER was also evaluated by cyclic voltammetric (CV) scanning (Figure S3) in 1.0 M KOH with 100 mM hydrazine. After continuous CV scanning for 500 cycles, the polarization curve shows negligible difference compared with the initial one (Figure 3c), suggesting superior stability of CoP/TiM for both processes. The time-dependent current density curve under a static overpotential of 100 mV (Figure 3d) suggests that CoP/TiM maintains its HER catalytic activity for at least 20 h.

Considering the excellent activity of CoP/TiM toward both HzOR and HER, we made a two-electrode electrolyzer with a membrane as a separator operated in 1.0 M KOH with 100 mM hydrazine, with the use of CoP/TiM as both anode for HzOR and cathode for HER. For comparison, pure water electrolysis was also tested using the same CoP/TiM couple without hydrazine. As shown in Figure 4a, CoP/TiM║CoP/TiM couple needs a cell voltage of 1.65 V to afford 10 mA cm-2 in the absence of hydrazine. The cell voltage to reach the same current density, however, is dramatically reduced to 0.2 V with 100 mM hydrazine. At cell voltages from 0 to 1 V, we observed continuous hydrogen evolution on the cathode (Movie S1). It can be seen from the movie that the small bubbles generate on the cathode at 0.2 V and further positive voltage causes more vigorous hydrogen release. The amount of generated H<sup>2</sup> was further measured quantitatively using a calibrated pressure sensor to monitor the pressure change in the cathode compartments of an H-type electrolytic cell. [25] As shown in Figure 4b, the generated H<sup>2</sup> roughly matches with the calculated one based on passed charge, suggesting a nearly 100% FE. Figure 4c shows the chronopotentiometric curve for CoP/TiM║CoP/TiM couple. As observed, a cell voltage about 0.3 V is required to drive 40 mA cm-2 at the beginning. After 5.5 h, the electrolyte solution was refreshed with the observation of rapid voltage drop, indicating the steadily drops of the cell voltage over the first 5.5 h can be largely attributed to consumption of hydrazine.

#### **4. Conclusions**

In summary, CoP nanoarray has been proven as an efficient and stable non-noble-metal catalyst for hydrazine oxidation in alkaline media. Its high catalytic activity toward HER enables it a bifunctional catalyst for energy-saving electrolytic hydrogen generation by replacing oxygen evolution with hydrazine oxidation and the corresponding two-electrode electrolyzer only needs a cell voltage of 0.2 V to drive 10 mA cm-2 with strong long-term electrochemical durability and nearly 100% FE for hydrogen evolution. The superior catalytic activity and stability for this CoP nanoarray, along with the simple and scalable fabrication process, promise its use as an attractive non-precious metal catalyst electrode toward energy-efficient large-scale electrolytic production of hydrogen fuels for applications. This work also opens an exciting new avenue in exploring the use of transition metal phosphides[38,39] toward less energy-intensive electrochemical hydrogen production.

CoP nanarray on Ti Mesh (CoP/TiM) behaves as a bifunctional catalyst for anodic hydrazine oxidation reaction and cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction in alkaline media. The two-electrode electrolyzer made of CoP/TiM requires a cell voltage of only 0.2 V to attain 10 mA cm-2 in 1.0 M KOH with 100 mM hydrazine, with remarkably high long-term electrochemical durability.

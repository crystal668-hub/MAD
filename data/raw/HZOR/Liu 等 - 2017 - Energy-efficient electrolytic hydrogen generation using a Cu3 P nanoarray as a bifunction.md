Energy-efficient electrolytic hydrogen generation is highly desired but still remains challenging. In this work, we demonstrate that a Cu<sub>7</sub>P nanoarray on copper foam (Cu<sub>7</sub>P/CF) behaves as a high-performance electrocatalyst for hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) in alkaline electrolytes. A full electrolytic system employing Cu<sub>3</sub>P/CF as both an anode for HzOR and a cathode for hydrogen evolution reaction drives 100 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> at a voltage of 0.72 V in 1.0 M KOH aqueous solution with 0.5 M hydrazine. It also demonstrates high long-term stability.

Rising global energy demands and associated climate changes have prompted an urgent search for clean and renewable energy solutions.<sup>1,2</sup> Molecular hydrogen produced from water splitting is regarded as a potential candidate for future energy supply.3 Active electrocatalysts however must be implemented to overcome the large water splitting overpotential making the process more energy-efficient.4 Great progress has been achieved during the past few years in developing non-precious metal catalysts with high activity for the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER)<sup>5-12</sup> and anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER).13-16 Of the two half reactions, OER is more kinetically sluggish owing to a multistep proton-coupled electron transfer process, which greatly impedes the overall water splitting efficiency.<sup>17</sup> As such, replacing OER with oxidation of more favorable species like methanol, ethanol, urea and glycerol<sup>18-21</sup> leads to a significantly reduced potential for anodic reaction, thus lowering the voltage required for hydrogen production.

energy density and environmentally friendly products (only water and nitrogen). 22,23 The performance of DHFCs significantly depends on the electrocatalysts for the anodic hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR). Compared with the aforementioned oxidizable species, hydrazine can be oxidized under a lower oxidation potential due to its strong reducing power, meaning its significant application to less energy-intensive hydrogen production in water splitting. Noble metals, such as Pt and Pd, 24,25 show catalytic activity and stability for HzOR, but the scarcity hinders their commercial applications. Thus, developing cheap and efficient non-noble-metal catalysts for HzOR is desirable and important. Recently, Cu-based catalysts have emerged as potentially low-cost and efficient candidates for catalyzing HzOR.26-30 The metalloid characteristics and good electrical conductivity of transition metal phosphides31,32 provide good benefit for enhanced electrochemical properties. Recent studies have indeed shown that Cu<sub>3</sub>P nanostructures are effective HER catalysts in acids.33,34 To the best of our knowledge, however, their use for HzOR electrocatalysis has not been demonstrated before.

Herein, we report that the Cu<sub>3</sub>P nanoarray on copper foam (Cu<sub>3</sub>P/CF) is an efficient electrocatalyst for HzOR with superior activity over its Cu(OH)2/CF precursor in alkaline media. When used as a bifunctional catalyst electrode for both anodic HzOR and cathodic HER, its two-electrode system needs a voltage of only 0.72 V to drive 100 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> in 1.0 M KOH with 0.5 M hydrazine. This system, however, delivers only 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> water-splitting current at 1.85 V in the absence of hydrazine.

The Cu(OH)2 nanoarray was directly grown on commercial CF via a room-temperature wet-chemical reaction route, and the subsequent low-temperature phosphidation converts the resulting Cu(OH)<sub>2</sub>/CF to Cu<sub>3</sub>P/CF (see the ESI† for details). The

Recently, direct hydrazine fuel cells (DHFCs) have attracted much attention with their high theoretical voltage, superior

CF changes in color from reddish brown to blue after surface oxidation with ammonium peroxodisulfate under alkaline conditions, with a color change to black after phosphidation. Fig. 1a presents the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns for the Cu(OH)<sub>2</sub>/CF precursor and Cu<sub>3</sub>P/CF. The precursor shows diffraction peaks characteristic of Cu(OH)<sub>2</sub> (ICPDS no. 35-0505). Meanwhile, the diffraction peaks at 36.7°, 39.3°, 42.3°, 45.5°, 46.8°, 48.2°, 53.8°, 67.1°, 68.9°, 71.3°, 77.3° and 78.7° for the phosphided product can be indexed to the (112), (202), (211), (300), (113), (212), (104), (214), (321), (322), (412) and (314) planes of the Cu<sub>3</sub>P phase (JCPDS no. 71-2261), respectively. The strong peaks at 43.5°, 50.7° and 74.6° originate from the CF substrate (JCPDS no. 03-1018). Fig. 1b presents the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of Cu(OH)<sub>2</sub>/CF, showing the full coverage of CF by arrayed Cu(OH)2 nanowires with diameters of about 100-300 nm and lengths of up to several micrometers. The Cu<sub>3</sub>P/CF still maintains its nanoarray feature (Fig. 1c). Fig. 1d and e show the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of one-single Cu(OH)2 and Cu3P nanowire, respectively, suggesting that the smooth surface of Cu(OH)<sub>2</sub> becomes rough after phosphidation. The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image obtained from Cu<sub>3</sub>P (Fig. 1f) reveals well-resolved lattice fringes with an interplanar distance of 2.0 Å corresponding to the (300) plane of Cu<sub>3</sub>P. The scanning TEM (STEM) image and the corresponding energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) elemental mapping images of Cu and P for Cu<sub>3</sub>P

are presented in Fig. 1g, revealing the uniform distribution of both Cu and P elements.

The electrocatalytic HzOR activity of Cu<sub>3</sub>P/CF was examined in a typical three-electrode setup with a scan rate of 5 mV s $^{-1}$ . All the potentials were reported on a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale. Fig. 2a shows the electrochemical performance of the Cu<sub>3</sub>P/CF in 1.0 M KOH with and without hydrazine. As observed, there is no anodic current within the investigated potential window for the solution without hydrazine. In contrast, the presence of 0.1 M hydrazine gives a sharply risen anodic current which increases with increased concentrations of hydrazine from 0.1 to 0.5 M. It suggests that Cu<sub>3</sub>P/CF is efficient for catalyzing the HzOR. Fig. 2b and S1† compare the electrocatalytic HzOR behavior of Cu<sub>3</sub>P/CF, Cu(OH)<sub>2</sub>/CF, Cu<sub>3</sub>P film, and bare CF in 1.0 M KOH with 0.5 M hydrazine. Both bare CF and Cu<sub>3</sub>P films have poor HzOR activity with a fairly low current density while Cu(OH)2/CF is efficient to catalyze HzOR with a need for a potential of 149 mV to drive 50 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. Remarkably, the Cu<sub>3</sub>P/CF electrode demonstrates greatly enhanced HzOR activity and only demands a low potential of 98 mV to drive the same current density, comparing favorably to the behaviors of previously reported Cu-based catalysts, including Cu films on Cu foam ( $\eta \approx 358$  mV at 50 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>), <sup>28</sup> porous Ni–Cu alloys ( $\eta \approx 128$  mV at 50 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>)<sup>29</sup> and Cu nanowire arrays ( $\eta \approx 310$  mV at 50 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>).<sup>30</sup> The Tafel slopes (Fig. 2c) are about 60 and 80 mV dec<sup>-1</sup> for Cu<sub>3</sub>P/CF and Cu(OH)<sub>2</sub>/CF, respectively, suggesting more favorable catalytic kinetics of Cu<sub>3</sub>P/CF for HzOR. To investigate the durability of the catalyst, we carried out hydrazine electrolysis experiment at a constant current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> for 3 h. The result (Fig. 2d) shows that the potential only increases by 50 mV after electrolysis, revealing the prominent stability of Cu<sub>3</sub>P/CF.

To estimate the electrochemically active surface areas of Cu<sub>3</sub>P/CF and Cu(OH)<sub>2</sub>/CF, we measured the capacitances of the double layers at solid/liquid interfaces of both electrodes. Fig. 3a and b show the cyclic voltammograms (CVs) collected in the region of 0.068 to 0.168 V, where the current response should be only due to the charging of double layers. The capacitances of Cu<sub>3</sub>P/CF and Cu(OH)<sub>2</sub>/CF are estimated as 31.4 and 7.1 mF cm<sup>-2</sup> (Fig. 3c), respectively, indicating that Cu<sub>3</sub>P/CF has a much higher surface roughness and thus exposes more active sites for HzOR than Cu(OH)2/CF. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) plots for Cu<sub>3</sub>P/CF and Cu(OH)<sub>2</sub>/CF are shown in Fig. 3d. It suggests that  $Cu_3P/CF$  has a smaller  $R_{ct}$ , indicative of more rapid catalytic kinetics for HzOR.

Although Cu<sub>3</sub>P is active for HER in acidic media,<sup>34</sup> our present study further reveals that it also performs efficiently in an alkaline environment. Fig. 4a shows the polarization curve of Cu<sub>3</sub>P/CF for simultaneous HER and HzOR in 1.0 M KOH with 0.5 M hydrazine using a three-electrode system (from -0.53 to 0.23 V). This electrode needs potentials of -496 and 152 mV to achieve a current density of 100 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> in HER and HzOR processes, respectively, suggesting its potential application as a bifunctional catalyst for electrolytic hydrogen generation. Thus, we constructed a two-electrode electrocatalytic system by using Cu<sub>3</sub>P/CF as both a cathode and anode (Cu<sub>3</sub>P/CF||Cu<sub>3</sub>P/CF) in 1.0 M KOH with 0.5 M hydrazine. This system shows superior performance capable of delivering 100 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> at a voltage of 0.72 V (Fig. 4b). Additionally, vigorous generation of gas bubbles occurs on both electrode surfaces (H2 through HER) and (N2 through HzOR) at a voltage of 1.0 V (Movie S1†). For comparison, full water splitting was also tested using Cu<sub>3</sub>P/CF as both a cathode and anode in 1.0 M KOH. Even to drive 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> water-splitting current,

it demands a much larger voltage of 1.85 V (Fig. 4c). These results indicate that replacing OER with HzOR in the anode is quite effective for energy-saving electrolytic hydrogen generation. Additionally, a 3 h chronopotentiometry experiment conducted at a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> in 1.0 M KOH with 0.5 M hydrazine (Fig. 4d) demonstrates that the voltage increases by less than 43 mV.

In conclusion, the Cu<sub>3</sub>P nanoarray on copper foam has been demonstrated to be a high-activity bifunctional catalyst electrode for energy-efficient electrolytic hydrogen production in alkaline media via replacing OER with HzOR. The corresponding two-electrode electrolytic system offers 100 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> at a voltage of 0.72 V with high long-term stability in 1.0 M KOH with 0.5 M hydrazine. This work would open an exciting new avenue in exploring the use of Cu<sub>3</sub>P and other transition metal phosphide35 nanostructures as attractive nonnoble-metal catalysts toward electro-oxidation of small molecules for energy-saving electrochemical production of hydrogen fuels.

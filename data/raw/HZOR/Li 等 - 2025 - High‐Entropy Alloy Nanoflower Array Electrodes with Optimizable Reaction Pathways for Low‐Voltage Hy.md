**Developing sufficiently effective non-precious metal catalysts for large-currentdensity hydrogen production is highly significant but challenging, especially in low-voltage hydrogen production systems. Here, we innovatively report highentropy alloy nanoflower array (HEANFA) electrodes with optimizable reaction pathways for hydrazine oxidation-assisted hydrogen production at industrialgrade current densities. Atomic-resolution structural analyses confirm the single-phase solid-solution structure of HEANFA. The HEANFA electrodes exhibit the top-level electrocatalytic performance for both the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR). Furthermore, the hydrazine oxidation-assisted splitting (OHzS) system assembled with HEANFA as both anode and cathode exhibits a record-breaking performance for hydrogen production. It achieves ultralow working voltages of 0.003, 0.081, 0.260, 0.376, and 0.646 V for current densities of 10, 100, 500, 1 000, and 2 000 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2, respectively, and remarkable stability for 300 h, significantly outperforming those of previously reported OHzS systems and other chemicals-assisted hydrogen production systems. Theoretical calculations reveal that extraordinary performance of HEANFA for OHzS is attributed to its abundant high-activity sites and optimizable reaction pathways in HER and HzOR. In particular, HEANFA enables intelligent migration of key intermediates during HzOR, thereby optimizing the reaction pathways and creating highactivity sites, ultimately endowing the extraordinary performance for OHzS.**

# **1. Introduction**

Electrocatalytic overall water splitting (OWS) driven by renewable electricity is widely regarded as one of the most sustainable and eco-friendly methods for producing high-purity hydrogen.[\[1–6\]](#page-8-0) Nevertheless, OWS currently accounts for only 4% of the global hydrogen production due to the slow kinetics of anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER, 1.23 V vs RHE),[\[7–10\]](#page-8-0) which requires a relatively high input voltage (*>*1.6 V) to attain the industrial-grade current density (1 000 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2), thereby resulting in high electricity costs.[\[11–13\]](#page-8-0) Furthermore, the heavy reliance on precious metal-based catalysts, with their limited availability and high cost, further constrains the large-scale implementation of OWS technology.[\[14,15\]](#page-8-0) To date, significant efforts have been dedicated to exploring non-precious metal catalysts for OWS.[\[16–21\]](#page-8-0) Although these alternatives seem promising, their relatively poor intrinsic activity and lifespan still cannot satisfy the necessary requirements for large-current-density hydrogen production in practical applications.[\[22–24\]](#page-8-0)

The substitution of the anodic OER in OWS system with the thermodynamically more favorable hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR, −0.33 V vs RHE) has been demonstrated as a highly effective strategy for achieving low-voltage, high-efficiency hydrogen production.[\[25–28\]](#page-8-0) Compared to conventional OWS, the overall hydrazine oxidation-assisted splitting (OHzS) system can reduce electricity consumption by more than half and improve safety, as it generates nitrogen (N2) as a byproduct instead of oxygen (O2).[\[29–31\]](#page-9-0) Moreover, the OHzS system also demonstrated promising potential applications in the fields of hydrogen production from electrolytic seawater[\[32,33\]](#page-9-0) and industrial wastewater.[\[34,35\]](#page-9-0) However, the OHzS hydrogen production technology is still a nascent field, and the current bifunctional electrocatalysts that this technique relies on are suffering from some inherent limitations, such as simple composition and structure, along with limited intrinsic activity. Consequently, it remains a substantial challenge to catalyze the cathodic and anodic reactions simultaneously and efficiently. Until now, few reports have achieved an industrial-grade current density of 1 000 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2, [\[29,36,37\]](#page-9-0) let alone 2 000 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2. In addition, the existing research on OHzS mechanisms mainly focuses on only one or two reaction pathways, failing to reflect the full complexity and reality of the reaction process. In light of these challenges, it is imperative to develop more advanced catalysts and conduct more in-depth mechanism studies to accelerate the research and practical application in the field of OHzS.

High-entropy alloy (HEA) catalysts have garnered significant attention for their remarkable catalytic properties.[\[38–42\]](#page-9-0) However, current research predominantly focuses on powder HEA catalysts, which must be coated onto conductive substrates for use in catalytic reactions.[\[38–40,42–44\]](#page-9-0) These powder materials often detach from the substrates, particularly under industrialgrade current densities, leading to an obvious decrease in catalytic performance.[\[45,46\]](#page-9-0) In contrast, self-supported array electrodes constructed by in situ growth of catalysts on conductive substrates not only ensure a tight contact between the catalyst and substrate, preventing catalyst detachment during the electrocatalytic process, but also promote rapid charge transfer and provide a larger specific surface area and abundant active sites.[\[47–50\]](#page-9-0) Further, porous array electrodes can also facilitate the diffusion of electrolytes and the rapid release of generated gases, thereby improving the overall mass transfer efficiency of the catalyst.[\[51–53\]](#page-9-0) Nonetheless, precisely fabricating HEA into nanosheet or nanoflower array structures and achieving uniform elemental distribution remain a big challenge, due to the complex nucleation and growth kinetics of different metals in HEAs. To the best of our knowledge, HEA nanosheet and nanoflower array electrodes with a single-phase structure have been rarely reported.

Here, we originally construct NiCoMoZnCu HEA nanoflower array (HEANFA) electrodes by an in situ conversion reduction method on Co foam substrates. The as-prepared HEA nanoflowers consist of 2D nanosheet structures exposing (111) facets. Atomic-resolution structural characterizations confirm their single-phase solid-solution structure. Benefiting from a large electrochemical active area and a superaerophobic surface, the HEANFA electrodes display the top-level performances for both alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and HzOR. Furthermore, a two-electrode OHzS system using HEANFA as both anode and cathode exhibits unprecedented performance for hydrogen production, achieving only 0.260, 0.376, and 0.646 V working voltages to drive industrial-grade current densities of 500, 1 000, and 2 000 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2, respectively, significantly outperforming those of other reported OHzS systems and OWS systems. Theoretical calculations reveal that the exceptional performance of HEANFA for OHzS can be ascribed to its abundant high-activity sites and optimizable reaction pathways in HER and HzOR. Notably, the tunable atomic configuration of HEANFA facilitates intelligent migration of key intermediates during HzOR, thereby creating new high-efficiency pathways and converting non-active sites into high-activity ones, ultimately endowing exceptional performance. The exceptional performance on OHzS provides powerful evidence for HEANFA as a sufficiently effective catalyst for large-current-density hydrogen production in lowvoltage systems.

## **2. Results and Discussion**

#### **2.1. Synthesis and Characterization**

Precisely fabricating nanoscale HEAs with defined morphologies and dimensions remains a great challenge due to the vast difference in physicochemical properties of the mixed metals. In particular, HEA nanosheets and nanoflower arrays are rarely reported. In this work, NiCoMoZnCu HEANFA was successfully prepared using an in situ conversion reduction method (details provided in the Experimental Section). Representative scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images at different magnifications (**Figures [1](#page-2-0)**a and S1, Supporting Information) reveal that the NiCoMoZnCu HEANFA has a rough surface, with nanoflowers interconnected through an internal network to form a stable array structure. Notably, after sufficient ultrasonic treatment, the dense nanoflower array remained intact, indicating a tight bonding between the HEANFA and the substrate. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) characterization (Figure [1b\)](#page-2-0) further confirms the flower-like morphology, where each nanoflower is composed of multiple 2D nanosheets, forming a 3D porous structure with a large surface area. The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image (Figure [1c\)](#page-2-0) reveals a lattice spacing of 2.07 Å, corresponding to the (111) plane of NiCoMoZnCu HEAs, consistent with the peak observed at 43.9° in the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns (Figure [1d\)](#page-2-0).[\[54\]](#page-9-0) This consistent lattice spacing across other nanoflowers implies that NiCoMoZnCu HEAs possess (111) basal planes (Figure S2, Supporting Information).

To eliminate the influence of the substrate, the HEA nanoflowers were scraped off for XRD analysis. The diffraction peaks at 43.9°, 51.0°, and 75.2° correspond to the (111), (200), and (220) planes of the face-centered-cubic (fcc) structure, confirming the successful preparation of fcc-phase NiCoMoZnCu HEAs. The valence electron concentration (VEC) exerts a decisive role in ascertaining the crystal structure of HEAs.[\[55–57\]](#page-9-0) Notably, a large VEC (≥8) is favorable for the formation of the fcc structure. The VEC of the NiCoMoZnCu HEAs was calculated to be 9.25, thus it prefers to form the fcc structure. Compared to pure Co, Ni, Mo, Zn, and Cu, NiCoMoZnCu HEAs exhibit noticeable shifts in diffraction peaks, indicating the formation of a solid-solution alloy structure. Experimental characterizations revealed that the formation of the NiCoMoZnCu HEANFA first underwent the

in situ dehydration of the high-entropy oxide precursor containing crystal water, then experienced the reduction of the oxides, and finally formed the single-phase solid-solution alloy structure (Figures S3 and S4, Supporting Information). As shown in Figure 1e and Figures S5 and S6 (Supporting Information), the energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) mapping and line scanning data of NiCoMoZnCu HEA nanoflowers confirm the uniform distribution of all five metal elements without segregation. Additionally, inductively coupled plasma (ICP) analysis revealed a Ni:Co:Mo:Zn:Cu molar ratio of 27:59:7:5:2 in NiCoMoZnCu HEANFA. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) further examined the surface chemical environment of the nanoflowers. XPS analysis (Figure S7, Supporting Information) further verified the presence of all five elements in the HEA nanoflowers. The zerovalent spectra of Co, Ni, Mo, Zn, and Cu indicate their metallic states within the HEA, while the high-valent species are attributed to the surface oxide layer formed during air exposure in the XPS tests.

Aberration-corrected high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) imaging technique, combined with atomic-resolution EDS mapping, was further employed to elucidate the atomic structure and precise elemental distribution in NiCoMoZnCu HEAs. Figure 1f displays a characteristic atomic-resolution image of the HEAs, along with the corresponding atomic-resolution elemental mapping. The uniform dispersion of Co, Ni, Mo, Cu, and Zn atoms within the bright sublattices clearly confirms the formation of a singlephase solid-solution structure, also demonstrating the homogeneous distribution of the five metals across the alloy.

#### **2.2. Electrocatalytic Performance for HER and HzOR**

The electrocatalytic performance of NiCoMoZnCu HEANFA electrodes for both HER and HzOR was evaluated in a standard three-electrode system at room temperature, with several control samples (NiCoZnCu array, NiCoMoZn array, NiCoMoCu array, NiMoZnCu array, CoMoZnCu array, NiCoZn array, NiCo array, commercial Pt/C, and Co foam (CF) substrates) examined under identical conditions for comparison. Both the HER (Figure S8, Supporting Information) and HzOR (Figure S9, Supporting Information) results showed that the NiCoMoZnCu HEANFA on Co foam achieves significantly higher catalytic activities than that on other foams. Thus, Co foam was selected as the final substrate for further investigations. **Figure [2](#page-3-0)**a illustrates the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves for HER in a 1.0 m KOH solution. Notably, HEANFA demonstrated superior electrocatalytic activity for HER, requiring ultrasmall overpotentials of just 242.9 and 307.5 mV to achieve industrial-grade current densities of 500 and 1 000 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2, respectively, outperforming NiCoZnCu (334.5 and 379.6 mV), NiCoZn (359.4 and 391.7 mV), NiCo (406.6 and 433.5 mV), Pt/C (365.5 and 437.5 mV), and CF (635.2 and 684.9 mV) (Figure S10, Supporting Information). Aside from Pt/C, HEANFA exhibited a relatively low Tafel slope of 61.4 mV

dec<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> (Figure 2b), indicating fast reaction kinetics for HER. The Tafel slope range of 40–120 mV dec<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> suggests that HER on HEANFA proceeds via the Volmer–Heyrovsky pathway.[\[58\]](#page-9-0) The prominent HER kinetics of HEANFA was further corroborated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), which revealed a significantly lower charge transfer resistance (Rct) compared to other electrodes (Figure 2c), indicating faster reaction kinetics at the electrolyte/catalyst interface. In addition, the whole activity of HEANFA is superior to those of NiCoZnCu, NiCoMoZn, NiCoMoCu, NiMoZnCu, and CoMoZnCu, indicating that the Mo, Cu, Zn, Co, and Ni elements in HEANFA are all effective active elements for HER (Figure S11, Supporting Information). Especially, the Mo plays an important role in boosting HER activity.

To further elucidate HEANFA's splendid HER activity, the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) was estimated using the double-layer capacitance (Cdl) derived from cyclic voltammetry (CV) (Figure S12, Supporting Information). As shown in Figure 2d, HEANFA exhibited an exceptionally high Cdl value of 268.8 mF cm<sup>−</sup>2, significantly exceeding that of the control samples, confirming its ultrahigh electrochemically active surface area. The gas release behavior during HER was also observed using optical microscopy to investigate bubble dynamics on HEANFA's rough surface. Compared to Pt/C electrodes (Figure S13, Supporting Information), HEANFA generated smaller H2 bubbles, which detached rapidly, allowing continuous exposure of active sites in time and promoting efficient mass transfer, demonstrating the electrode's superaerophobic properties. Stability is a crucial parameter for electrocatalysts in practical applications, and HEANFA's long-term durability was assessed using chronopotentiometry method (Figure 2e). After 55 h of continuous testing, HEANFA maintained 98.2% of its initial current density, significantly outperforming commercial Pt/C, which retained only 73.4% after 15 h (Figure S14, Supporting Information). This remarkable stability underscores HEANFA's potential for sustained performance in industrial applications. Post-HER characterizations (Figure S15, Supporting Information) reveal that the nanoflower array structure and composition of HEANFA are well preserved, further underscoring its exceptional stability. This remarkable stability can be attributed to the high-entropy stabilization effect,[\[39,44,59\]](#page-9-0) which enhances corrosion resistance. Additionally, the selfsupported array structure of HEANFA ensures strong adhesion between the nanoflowers and the substrate, preventing detachment during electrocatalysis and contributing to its outstanding stability. Finally, to further assess HEANFA's catalytic activity level for HER, its performance was compared with other recently reported advanced catalysts. As shown in Figure 2f and Table S1 (Supporting Information), HEANFA exhibits the lowest overpotentials at 500 and 1 000 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2, ade-

quately demonstrating the top-level performance of HEANFA for HER.

The electrocatalytic performance of HEANFA for HzOR was evaluated in 1.0 m KOH with varying hydrazine concentrations. Figure S16 (Supporting Information) demonstrates that current density increases with higher hydrazine concentrations, indicating that HEANFA has an efficient catalytic activity for HzOR. Meanwhile, Figure S17 (Supporting Information) also revealed that all five elements in HEANFA were effective active elements for HzOR. **Figure 3**a fully substantiates the extremely outstanding activity of HEANFA for HzOR, as it significantly outperforms the other samples in terms of the current density growth rate. Moreover, HEANFA's Tafel slope of 33.2 mV dec<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> (Figure 3b) is the lowest among all samples, further verifying its superior current density increase during HzOR. At a potential of + 0.05 V (vs RHE) (Figure 3c), HEANFA achieves an unprecedented current (1480.0 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2), which is 2.3, 3.0, 4.3, and 4.9 times higher than that of NiCoZnCu (654.5 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2), NiCoZn (493.5 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2), NiCo (345.6 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2), and Pt/C (302.1 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2), respectively. HEANFA also demonstrated the lowest Rct among the samples, as shown in Figure 3d, confirming its excellent charge transfer kinetics. The superaerophobic properties of HEANFA during HzOR were also validated through gas release records (Figure S18, Supporting Information). Likewise, HEANFA exhibited exceptional stability, maintaining 96.8% of its initial current density after 50 h of continuous testing, while Pt/C retained only 65.6% after 7 h (Figure S19, Supporting Information). Post-HzOR characterization conducted by SEM indicated that HEANFA retained its nanoflower morphology and uniform element distribution (Figure S20, Supporting Information). The XRD pattern and lattice spacing of the HEANFA after HzOR test exhibited no noticeable change (Figures S21 and S22, Supporting Information), revealing that HEANFA still maintained its original crystal structure. In addition, XPS analysis (Figure S23, Supporting Information) and in situ electrochemical Raman spectra (Figure S24, Supporting Information) confirmed that the HEANFA was not oxidized and no electrochemical reconstruction occurred in the HEANFA during HzOR process. Finally, the HzOR performance of HEANFA was compared with other stateof-the-art catalysts (Figure 3f and Table S2, Supporting Information). Impressively, HEANFA achieved the smallest potentials of −18.6 and 16.9 mV to reach industrial-grade current densities of 500 and 1 000 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2, respectively, which are record-breaking performances to date.

#### **2.3. Electrocatalytic Performance for OHzS System**

Replacing the anodic OER in OWS system with the thermodynamically more favorable HzOR is considered a highly promising and innovative strategy for achieving low-voltage, high-efficiency hydrogen production. As shown in Figure S25

<span id="page-5-0"></span>**Figure 4.** Electrochemical performance of the two-electrode OHzS electrolyzer using HEANFA as both anode and cathode. a) Polarization curves of OHzS in 1.0 m KOH/0.2 m N2H4 and OWS in 1.0 m KOH, using HEANFA as bifunctional electrodes. b) Quantitative comparison of cell voltages at 500 and 1 000 mA cm−<sup>2</sup> based on HER coupling with various anodic reactions in the recent literatures. The SOR, EGOR, FOR, UOR, BAOR, AAOR, HMFOR, GOR, and COR refer to oxidation reaction of sulfion, ethylene glycol, formaldehyde, urea, benzyl alcohol, ascorbic acid, 5-hydroxymethyl furfural, glycerol, and cyclohexanone, respectively. c) Polarization curve comparison of the HEANFA and Pt/C for OHzS in 1.0 m KOH solution with 0.2 m N2H4. d) Stability test of HEANFA conducted in two-electrode OHzS electrolyzer for 300 h. e) Quantitative comparison of cell voltages at different current densities for OHzS using HEANFA and other reported advanced materials as bifunctional electrodes/catalysts.

(Supporting Information), the LSV curve comparison of HEANFA for HzOR and OER clearly demonstrates the overwhelming advantages of HzOR electrolysis. Given the exceptional HER and HzOR performance of HEANFA, an overall hydrazine oxidation-assisted splitting (OHzS) two-electrode system was constructed, with HEANFA serving as both the cathode and anode, as schematically illustrated in Figure S26 (Supporting Information). Notably, this OHzS system achieved a notable improvement in low-voltage hydrogen production. **Figures 4**a and S27 (Supporting Information) show that the OHzS system only requires minimal working voltages of 0.003, 0.081, 0.260, 0.376, and 0.646 V to achieve current densities of 10, 100, 500, 1 000, and 2 000 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2, respectively, considerably lower than the voltages required by the OWS system at the same current densities. To further validate the superiority of the OHzS system for low-voltage hydrogen production, its performance was compared with other reported small-molecule-oxidationassisted hydrogen production technologies at industrial-grade www.advancedsciencenews.com

current densities. As illustrated in Figure 4b and Table S3 (Supporting Information), the OHzS system using HEANFA electrodes outperforms all others, exhibiting the lowest working voltages at industrial-grade current densities of 500, 1 000, and 2 000 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. Moreover, to further demonstrate HEANFA's extremely high intrinsic activity for OHzS, the performance of commercial Pt/C was evaluated under the same conditions (Figure 4c and Figures S28 and S29, Supporting Information). Notably, the OHzS system with HEANFA achieved an ultrahigh current density of 2 000 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> at a cell voltage of 0.646 V in 1.0 м КОН solution with 0.2 м hydrazine, whereas the system with Pt/C only reached 623 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> at the same voltage, confirming HEANFA's ultrahigh intrinsic activity for OHzS. Stability is a critical factor for practical catalyst applications, particularly in two-electrode electrolyzers. However, stability tests for OHzS reported in the literature have rarely surpassed 150 h, and most were conducted at low current densities (below 200 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>). In this study, the long-term stability of HEANFA was tested at large current densities in the OHzS system. As shown in Figure 4d and Figure S30 (Supporting Information), HEANFA maintained operation for 300 h, which was superior to other non-high-entropy samples, indicating a significant highentropy stabilization effect of HEANFA. Nonetheless, HEANFA still showed a certain degree of activity degradation during the stability test. Subsequent characterizations (Figures S31-S33, Supporting Information) revealed that the activity degradation of HEANFA during the stability test was associated with the decline in its ECSA caused by the morphology alterations under large current densities. Finally, to further emphasize the advantages of HEANFA as a bifunctional electrode in the OHzS system, its performance was compared with that of recently reported state-of-the-art electrocatalysts and electrodes used in OHzS electrolyzers (Figure 4e and Tables S4 and S5, Supporting Information). It can be observed that few reports have achieved industrial-grade current densities of 1 000 and 2 000 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> to date. Furthermore, among all the reported electrocatalysts and electrodes for OHzS systems, HEANFA exhibits the lowest working voltages for achieving current densities of 10, 100, 500, 1 000, and 2 000 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, adequately demonstrating the record-breaking performance of HEANFA for OHzS.

#### 2.4. DFT Calculation and Analysis

To comprehensively elucidate the origin of the extraordinary performance of NiCoMoZnCu HEANFA for both cathodic HER and anodic HzOR in OHzS system, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed. Reasonably constructing the structural models of HEA catalysts is critical for uncovering their actual catalytic mechanisms. Therefore, ten potential structural models of NiCoMoZnCu HEAs were initially simulated (Figure S34, Supporting Information), and the one with the lowest surface energy was selected for further optimization. Once the XRD patterns of the optimized model aligned completely with the experimental XRD patterns of NiCoMoZnCu HEANFA (Figure S35, Supporting Information), the structural model was determined, as depicted in Figure 5a. A pure Pt model was also constructed for comparison (Figure S36, Supporting Information). The HER catalytic mechanism of HEANFA was first investi-

gated. As noted above, the HEANFA mainly followed a Volmer-Heyrovsky pathway. Figure 5b and Figure S37 and Table S6 (Supporting Information) present the H<sub>2</sub>O adsorption energies (E<sub>2d</sub>) on various sites of the HEANFA (111) surface and the pure Pt (111) surface. It was found that H<sub>2</sub>O molecules show a greater tendency to adsorb on the HEANFA surface compared to the Pt surface. Moreover, all energy barriers for H2O dissociation at the Co (0.51 eV), Mo (0.43 eV), Cu (0.76 eV), Ni (0.61 eV), and Zn (0.39 eV) sites of the HEANFA surface were significantly lower than those at the Pt site on the pure Pt surface (0.95 eV) (Figure 5c), suggesting that the HEANFA surface facilitates the dissociation of H<sub>2</sub>O into H\* during the Volmer step. Subsequently, the free energies for the Heyrovsky step  $(H^* + H_2O)$  $\rightarrow$ H<sub>2</sub> + OH\*) at different sites on the HEANFA (111) surface were investigated. As shown in Figure 5d and Table S7 (Supporting Information), the free energies for the Heyrovsky step at all HEANFA surface sites were markedly lower than at the Pt site on the Pt surface (0.23 eV), indicating that the reaction of H\* with H2O to form H2 during the Heyrovsky step was more favorable for HEANFA. In addition, it is generally accepted that the hydrogen-adsorption free energy ( $\Delta G_{H^*}$ ) is a crucial descriptor for assessing the HER activity, and an ideal catalyst should have  $\Delta G_{H^*}$  that is close to zero.<sup>[60]</sup> Thus,  $\Delta G_{H^*}$  was calculated for 17 representative sites on the HEANFA (111) surface (Figure \$38, Supporting Information). As demonstrated in Table \$8 (Supporting Information) and Figure 5e, most sites (13 in total) on the HEANFA (111) surface exhibited smaller absolute  $\Delta G_{H*}$  values compared to the Pt site on the Pt surface, suggesting that most HEANFA surface sites serve as effective active sites, favoring both H<sup>+</sup> adsorption and H<sub>2</sub> desorption during HER. In conclusion, HEANFA possesses abundant high-activity sites, providing numerous high-efficiency pathways and thereby contributing to its ultrahigh activity for HER.

The catalytic mechanism of HEANFA for HzOR was also thoroughly investigated. It should be pointed out that most current studies on the HzOR mechanism are limited to one or two sites or pathways, which fail to reflect the full complexity and reality of the reaction process. To address this limitation, 12 representative sites on the HEANFA surface were selected for the HzOR mechanism analysis in this study (Figure \$39, Supporting Information). The adsorption energy results demonstrate that all 12 sites on the HEANFA surface exhibit more favorable N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> adsorption compared to the Pt site on the pure Pt surface (Table \$9, Supporting Information), facilitating the occurrence of HzOR on the HEANFA surface. Subsequently, the four-electron dehydrogenation process of  $N_2H_4$  molecule  $(N_2H_4 \rightarrow N_2H_3 \rightarrow N_2H_2 \rightarrow$  $N_2H \rightarrow N_2$ ) was included as the main calculation path, which is consistent with previous reports. [61,62] The calculated free energy values for the stepwise dehydrogenation process on the 12 representative sites of the HEANFA surface and the Pt site of the Pt (111) surface are summarized in Table \$10 (Supporting Information). Notably, 4 sites (HzOR-7, 9, 11, and 12) exhibited significantly lower energy barriers (0.15, 0.20, 0.25, and 0.23 eV, respectively) in the rate-determining step (RDS) compared to the Pt site (0.35 eV), as shown in Figure 5f. This indicates that these 4 sites are all high-activity sites, contributing high-efficiency reaction pathways for boosting the HzOR.

In further investigations, an unanticipated catalytic property on HEANFA surface was unveiled. Specifically, the tunable

The migration of the \*N2H2 intermediate from HzOR-6 to the nearby HzOR-10 site for dehydrogenation significantly reduces the RDS energy barrier, thereby creating a new highefficiency pathway at HzOR-(6 + 10) site. h) Calculated free energy profiles for the HzOR process between HzOR-3, HzOR-4, and HzOR-8 sites on HEANFA (111) surface. Intelligent migration of key intermediates resulted in two new high-efficiency pathways at HzOR-(4 + 8) and HzOR-(3 + 4 + 8) sites.

atomic configuration of HEANFA enables intelligent migration of key intermediates during HzOR, thereby optimizing reaction pathways and converting non-active sites into high-activity sites. As depicted in Figure 5g, the RDS of the HzOR-6 site is \*N2H2- \*N2H, with a high energy barrier of 0.36 eV, indicating an nonactive or low-activity pathway on the HzOR-6 site. However, the \*N2H2 intermediate can migrate to the adjacent HzOR-10 site, where it undergoes dehydrogenation to form \*N2H with a much lower barrier of 0.23 eV, thereby creating a new high-efficiency pathway, as illustrated on the HzOR-(6 + 10) site. Similarly, the HzOR-4 and HzOR-3 sites are also non-active or low-activity sites, featuring RDS energy barriers of 0.42 and 0.41 eV, respectively, higher than that of pure Pt site (0.35 eV). Whereas, after intelligent migration of key intermediates, the new pathways on both HzOR-(4 + 8) and HzOR-(3 + 4 + 8) sites achieve much lower RDS energy barriers (0.16 eV) (Figure 5h and Table S11, Supporting Information), significantly optimizing the reaction pathways and creating high-activity sites for HzOR.

Overall, the extraordinary performance of HEANFA for the overall OHzS system is attributed to its abundant high-activity sites and optimizable reaction pathways in HER and HzOR. In particular, the tunable atomic configuration of HEANFA facilitates intelligent migration of key intermediates during HzOR, thereby creating new, high-efficiency pathways and converting non-active sites into high-activity sites, ultimately contributing to the extraordinary performance for OHzS. Furthermore, the

catalytic mechanisms of optimizing reaction pathways and creating high-activity sites proposed here can provide a new paradigm to unveil other unique catalytic mechanisms of high-entropy catalysts in energy-related fields.

# **3. Conclusion**

In summary, we first constructed NiCoMoZnCu HEANFA electrodes with abundant high-activity sites and optimizable reaction pathways for low-voltage hydrogen production at industrial-grade current densities. The HEANFA was composed of 2D nanosheet with exposed (111) facets. Atomic-resolution structural characterizations confirmed the single-phase solid-solution structure of the HEANFA. With a large electrochemical active area and a superaerophobic surface, the HEANFA electrodes afforded the top-level performances for both alkaline HER and HzOR. When integrated into a two-electrode OHzS system, where HEANFA served as both anode and cathode, the system exhibited unprecedented performance for hydrogen production, achieving only 0.260, 0.376, and 0.646 V to drive industrial-grade current densities of 500, 1 000, and 2 000 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2, respectively, and remarkable stability for 300 h, significantly outperforming those of other reported OHzS systems and OWS systems. DFT calculations revealed that the extraordinary performance of HEANFA for OHzS was ascribed to its abundant high-activity sites and optimizable reaction pathways in HER and HzOR. Notably, the tunable atomic configuration of HEANFA facilitated the intelligent migration of key intermediates during HzOR, thereby creating new high-efficiency pathways and converting non-active sites into high-activity sites, ultimately endowing the extraordinary performance of HEANFA for OHzS. This work not only constructs HEANFA as sufficiently effective electrodes for large-current-density hydrogen production in low-voltage systems but also provides a reference for unveiling other unique catalytic mechanisms of high-entropy catalysts in energy-related fields.

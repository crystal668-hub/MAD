**Abstract:** The traditional technologies for industrial and agricultural effluent treatment are often energy-intensive. Herein, we suggest an electrochemical redox strategy for spontaneous and simultaneous decontamination of wastewater and generation of both fuels and electricity at low cost. Using hydrazine and nitrate effluents as a demonstration, we propose a hydrazinenitrate flow battery (HNFB) that can efficiently purify the wastewater and meanwhile generate both ammonia fuel and electricity with the assistance of our developed bimetallic RuCo precatalyst. Specifically, the battery delivers a peak power density of 12 mWcm <sup>2</sup> and continuously operates for 20 h with an ammonia yield rate of ca. 0.38 mmolh <sup>1</sup> cm <sup>2</sup> under 100 mAcm <sup>2</sup> . The generated electricity can further drive a hydrazine electrolyzer to produce hydrogen fuel. Our work provides an alternative pathway to purify wastewater and generate high value-added fuels at low cost.

### *Introduction*

Water pollution is a serious issue that has aroused global concern in recent years.[1] The direct discharge of industrial and agricultural effluents would threaten the ecological system, and thus they have to be treated and decontaminated before being discharged. The traditional wastewater treatment methods include biological metabolism, physical

multi-effect evaporation crystallization process, and chemical Fenton reaction, etc.[2] These processes often involve complicated separation steps, high energy consumption, and extra chemical use, which require high capital investment. Accordingly, it is imperative to develop new sewage treatment methods to lower the cost.

Herein, we propose a general electrochemical redox strategy for spontaneous and simultaneous decontamination of wastewater and generation of both fuels and electricity. We use nitrate (NO3 ) and hydrazine (N2H4) sewage as a demonstration (the former is a common pollutant in industry and agriculture, while the latter is a widely used feedstock that can be obtained from the pharmaceutical, dyestuff, rubber and metal recycling industries by collecting the residual wastewater),[3] we show that both electricity and ammonia (NH3) fuel can be generated by delicately coupling the anodic hydrazine oxidation reaction (N2H4 4e +4OH !N2+4H2O, HzOR) and cathodic nitrate reduction reaction (NO3 +8 e +6H2O!NH3 +9OH , NtrRR). The standard electrode potential of the former is 1.16 V vs. standard hydrogen electrode (SHE), and is 0.12 V vs. SHE for the latter (see the Pourbaix diagram in Figure S1). The combination of these two half reactions, therefore, would generate a high theoretical discharge voltage of 1.04 V (NO3 +2N2H4!NH3 +2N2+2H2O+OH ), along with ammonia fuel production upon wastewater purification. It is noted that other electrochemical systems by coupling urea oxidation with CO2 reduction, HzOR with hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), or Zn oxidation with small molecules (e.g., C2H2, CO2/N2) reduction have been explored to deliver electricity along with producing high valueadded products.[4] However, the proposed hydrazine-nitrate system involves different reactions and mechanisms, and thus different catalyst requirements and design principles.

We for the first time designed a hydrazine-nitrate flow battery (HNFB, Scheme 1) to verify the feasibility of our strategy. The hydrazine and nitrate effluents are flowed into the anodic and cathodic chambers of the HNFB, respectively, which are separated by a proton exchange membrane. On site electricity generation can be realized once the two electrodes are connected. Although this concept is theoretically feasible, the greatest challenge lies in electrocatalysts that need to catalyze both the HzOR and NtrRR with minimized overpotentials and thus to maximize the output voltage. Compared with HzOR, the NtrRR involves eightelectron transfer and thus is more kinetically sluggish.[5]

*Scheme 1.* Illustration of the design of a HNFB for simultaneous wastewater purification as well as electricity and ammonia generation.

While many catalysts have been developed towards the HzOR with decent activity (e.g., Ni3N-Co3N catalyst requires only 0.088 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) at 10 mAcm <sup>2</sup> ),[6] there lacks of efficient catalysts that can drive the NtrRR at sufficiently high potentials so as to couple with the HzOR to form a galvanic cell.[7]

In this work, we developed a bimetallic RuCo precatalyst (which will be in situ reconstructed into RujCo(OH)2 heterostructures during the electrocatalysis) that can efficiently catalyze both the HzOR and NtrRR. Specifically, the resulting RujCo(OH)2 catalyst delivers only 0.031 and 0.161 V vs. RHE at �100 mAcm <sup>2</sup> for the HzOR and NtrRR in 1 M KOH/0.1 M N2H4 and 1 M KOH/0.1 M KNO3, respectively. More importantly, the assembled HNFB can achieve a peak power density of 12 mWcm <sup>2</sup> and continuously operate for 20 h with an ammonia yield of ca. 0.38 mmolh <sup>1</sup> cm <sup>2</sup> under 100 mAcm <sup>2</sup> . The HNFB can also spontaneously drive a hydrazine electrolyzer to produce hydrogen fuel.

### *Results and Discussion*

The synthesis of bimetallic RuCo precatalyst self-supported on cobalt foam (CF) substrate is illustrated in Figure 1a (also see details in Supporting Information). The Co(OH)2 nanorods (Figure S2) were first synthesized by a hydrothermal method, followed by a cation exchange to form the Ru loaded Co(OH)2 precursor (Figure S3), which was finally annealed under a reductive atmosphere to produce the

bimetallic RuCo catalyst. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images show that the bimetallic RuCo nanorods vertically grow on CF (Figures 1b and S4). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-angle annular darkfield scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM) images as well as the corresponding elemental maps indicate that Ru nanoparticles are densely anchored on the surface, especially the edge regions of Co nanorods, (Figures 1c, d and Figure S5). The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image (Figure 1e) and the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (Figure 1f) further confirms the existence of the diphase Ru and Co metals. To avoid the interference of CF, we ultrasonically stripped the bimetallic RuCo precatalyst from the CF substrate to conduct X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements. The XRD pattern reveals the diffraction peaks of *hcp* Co metal (Figure 1g). While we did not observe the diffraction peaks of Ru metal, which can be ascribed to its significantly lower mass loading (ca. 0.1461 mg cm <sup>2</sup> ), compared to that of Co metal (ca. 1.27 mg cm <sup>2</sup> ). The XPS result also confirms the presence of metallic Ru and Co elements on the surface, along with the corresponding oxides because of the exposure to air (Figure S6). The above evidence supports that we have successfully synthesized the bimetallic RuCo precatalyst.

To evaluate the electrocatalytic performance of the bimetallic RuCo, we first carried out the HzOR tests in a 1 M KOH/0.1 M N2H4 electrolyte (Figure S7). For comparison, we also prepared commercial 5% Ru/C, Co, and Ru metals as well as Co(OH)2 on CFs (see details in Supporting Information). Impressively, the bimetallic RuCo displays the lowest potential ( 0.031 V vs. RHE, after *iRs* correction, also see the raw data in Figure S8) to reach 100 mAcm <sup>2</sup> (Figure 2a), meaning that it possesses the highest geometric activity among the investigated catalysts. In addition, the RuCo exhibits the highest specific surface area normalized activity (Figure S9) and Ru mass activity (Figure S10), which indicates that the difference in surface area or Ru mass cannot fully account for the disparity of the electrocatalytic activity between RuCo and other catalysts, while the strong metal-support interactions also significantly contribute to the high activity of RuCo, as will be discussed later. Moreover, the bimetallic RuCo possesses the lowest Tafel slope (derived from geometric polarization curves, 45.72 mVdec <sup>1</sup> , Figure 2b), suggesting its fastest HzOR kinetics among the studied catalysts. This is further confirmed by electrochemical impedance spectra (Figure 2c), where the bimetallic RuCo displays the smallest charge transfer impedance at 0.05 V vs. RHE. We also found that the HzOR potential becomes more negative as the hydrazine concentration increases, especially at high currents (Figure S11), which means that the mass transfer greatly affects the HzOR efficiency. Notably, the activity of the bimetallic RuCo under high currents is better than or at least comparable to that of recently reported high-performance HzOR catalysts (Table S1). Besides the high activity, the bimetallic RuCo also shows outstanding stability with a negligible potential decay under high current densities from 100 to 400 mAcm <sup>2</sup> (Figure 2d), along with ca. 100% Faradaic efficiencies towards N2 at the corresponding current densities (Figures 2e and S12).

Post characterizations after the long-term HzOR stability test reveal the formation of RujCo(OH)2 nanosheets on the surface of the RuCo precatalyst (Figures S13–S15), due to the in situ surface reconstruction of the RuCo catalyst under strongly oxidative and alkaline conditions. We also found that the surface reconstruction could be quickly completed even after a 1 h of chronopotentiometry test at

300 mAcm <sup>2</sup> (Figure S16), and thereafter the reconstructed RujCo(OH)2 heterostructures serve as the real active sites for the HzOR to deliver a stable HzOR performance. It is further noted that the Ru 3p XPS peaks of the RuCo precatalyst after the HzOR positively shift by 0.2 eV (Figure S15c), suggesting the formation of electron-deficient Ru sites and thus the strong interactions between interfacial Ru and Co(OH)2.

In order to investigate the origin of HzOR activity of the bimetallic RuCo precatalyst after the surface reconstruction, we conducted the density functional theory calculation (DFT) using the RujCo(OH)2 heterostructure for modeling (Figure S17, see details in Supporting Information). We first investigated the electron distribution by charge density difference analysis (Figure S18). The result reveals that the interfacial Ru atoms exhibit the electron-deficient state, while the adjacent Co atoms are electron-enriched, suggesting the strong interactions of Ru and Co(OH)2, well in line with the Ru 3p XPS analysis (Figure S15c). We then studied the HzOR energetics of both the surface and interfacial metal sites (Figure S19), and found that the desorption of the \*N2 intermediate to N2 is the potential determining step (PDS) for all metal sites, wherein the interfacial electrondeficient Ru site requires the lowest desorption free energy of 0.439 eV, followed by the interfacial Co (0.509 eV), surface Ru (0.605 eV) and surface Co (1.327 eV) sites. Indeed, the interfacial electron-deficient Ru site displays the smallest *d* band center value of 1.79 eV (calculated from the projected density of states diagrams, Figure S20), furthest away from the Fermi level among the four metal- \*N2 desorption configurations, suggesting the most favorable release of the \*N2 intermediate. It is also noted that the HzOR energetics of the individual Ru and Co(OH)2 catalysts is almost identical to that of surface Ru and Co sites in RujCo(OH)2 heterostructures, respectively (Figure S21). This result demonstrates that the RujCo(OH)2 heterostructure, especially the interfacial electron-deficient Ru sites are critical in achieving the superior HzOR activity.

We then conducted the NtrRR tests in a 1 M KOH/ 0.1 M KNO3 electrolyte (Figure S7). As shown in Figure 3a, the bimetallic RuCo displays the most positive potential (0.161 V vs. RHE, after *iRs* correction, also see the raw data in Figure S22) at 100 mAcm <sup>2</sup> and the lowest Tafel slope (78.17 mVdec <sup>1</sup> , Figure 3b), suggesting the highest NtrRR activity and fastest kinetics. The highest intrinsic activity and mass activity of the bimetallic RuCo precatalyst are further confirmed by both the specific surface area and Ru mass loading normalized polarization curves (Figures S23 and 24). It is worth noting that the bimetallic RuCo would not catalyze the competing HER even at a high cathodic current density of 400 mAcm <sup>2</sup> (Figure 3a), and the NtrRR activity remarkably surpasses other reported catalysts (Table S2). All the investigated catalysts exhibit the nearly unity Faradaic efficiencies of ammonia production (determined by ion chromatography, IC, Figure S25), and the corresponding yield rates are ca. 1.39 mmolh <sup>1</sup> cm <sup>2</sup> under 300 mAcm <sup>2</sup> except for the 5% Ru/C (Figures 3c and S26), which suffers from the competing HER since numerous bubbles were observed during the electrolysis. Similar to the HzOR, the efficiency of the NtrRR also largely relies on the mass transfer of nitrate in the electrolyte (Figure S27). In addition, we found that the NtrRR Faradaic efficiencies of ammonia and nitrite (NO2 ) production (determined by IC, Figure S25) of the bimetallic RuCo highly depend on the reaction conditions (Figure S28). Specifically, more negative potentials or larger cathodic currents are beneficial to weakening the adsorption ability of the nitrite intermediate and thus accelerating the subsequent kinetics towards ammonia. 15N-isotope labeled nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) test further confirms that the produced ammonia

originates from nitrate in the electrolyte, and thus the effect of the environmental ammonia is negligible if there is any (Figure S29). Moreover, the bimetallic RuCo can be operated for several tens of hours under the cathodic current densities from 100 to 400 mAcm <sup>2</sup> (Figure 3d), along with high ammonia Faradaic efficiencies of more than 95% (Figures 3e and S30).

Similar to what we have observed in HzOR, the post characterizations of the bimetallic RuCo after the NtrRR also reveal that its surface morphology has changed. Specifically, the surface of bimetallic RuCo is reconstructed into RujCo(OH)2 heterostructures (Figures S31–S33), which are supposed to be the real active components for the NtrRR. It is noted that the reconstruction of Co species during the NtrRR can be attributed to the redox between the catalyst and nitrate in the alkaline electrolyte.[9] We also found that the thorough reconstruction process can be quickly realized even after a 1 h of chronopotentiometry test under 300 mAcm <sup>2</sup> (Figure S34). The XPS analysis reveals a positive shift of 0.15 eV for the Ru 3p peaks after the NtrRR (Figure S33c), indicating the formation of electrondeficient Ru atoms at the RujCo(OH)2 heterointerfaces and thus the strong interactions between Ru and Co(OH)2 species (Figure S18).[8]

In order to further explore the activity origin of the reconstructed RujCo(OH)2 catalyst, we also conducted the DFT calculations. Different from the single-site adsorption model of hydrazine molecules, we found that the NtrRR preferably proceeds through a dual-sites model. We evaluated three most possible active sites configurations (i.e., surface Ru dual-sites, interfacial Ru and Co sites, and surface Co dual-sites) for the NtrRR energetics calculation (Figure S35). The result reveals that the PDSs of three models are all the final desorption of the \*NH3 intermediate. Of note, the optimal desorption metal sites for three models are surface Ru, interfacial Ru, and surface Co atoms, and the corresponding desorption free energies are 1.841, 0.969, and 2.844 eV, respectively. This result suggests that the interfacial Ru and Co sites are likely the active sites for NtrRR. The PDOS diagram also shows that the metallic *d* band center of Ru \*NH3 model is further away from the Fermi level than that of the surface Co \*NH3 model (Figure S36), suggesting the favorable desorption ability of the former. However, we found that the *d* band centers of surface and interfacial Ru desorption sites are almost identical. To further distinguish their desorption ability, we evaluated the *d-p* orbital hybridization of the surface and interfacial Ru \*NH3 configurations (Figure S36). Specifically, the overlapped area between the *d* orbital of the interfacial electron-deficient Ru site and the *p* orbital of the adjacent N ligand is significantly smaller than that of the surface Ru N counterpart. Meanwhile, the overall peak location of *p* orbital of the former is much closer to the Fermi level than that of the latter. These results point to a weakened *d-p* orbital hybridization of the interfacial Ru \*NH3 model,[10] which would accelerate the release of the \*NH3 adsorbate and thus achieves a higher NtrRR activity. It is also noted that the NtrRR energetics of the individual Ru and Co(OH)2 catalysts is almost identical to that of the surface Ru and Co sites in the RujCo(OH)2 heterostructure, respectively (Figure S37). This again confirms the important role of the RujCo(OH)2 heterostructure, and essentially the interfacial Ru sites.

In view of the excellent HzOR and NtrRR performance of the bimetallic RuCo precatalyst (Figure S38), we further assembled a HNFB (Scheme 1). The open circuit voltage (OCV) is close to 0 V when 1 M KOH was used as the electrolyte (Figure 4a). However, after the addition of hydrazine and nitrate sewage, even at a low concentration of only 1 mM, the OCV sharply rises to 0.94 V. This strongly verifies the feasibility of the proposed HNFB. In order to further evaluate the operating efficiency of the HNFB, we plotted the polarization curves by steady-state chronopotentiometry. As shown in Figure 4b, the HNFB performance highly depends on the wastewater concentration. Specifically, the discharging power density gradually increases from 2.82 to 16.8 mWcm <sup>2</sup> (after *iR* correction, see details in Figure S39) with the sewage concentration from 1 to 1000 mM, respectively. This suggests that high sewage concentration would improve the mass transfer and thus the HNFB performance. It is noted that even when the wastewater concentration is only 1 mM, the HNFB is still practically feasible despite the relatively low operating efficiency (Figure S39h), showing a great potential for wastewater decontamination. The power densities of the HNFB outperform the vast majority of pollutant-type batteries including Zn-nitrate batteries, Zn-nitrite batteries, Zn-NO batteries, and Zn-C2H2 batteries, etc. (Figure S40 and Table S3).

Considering ammonia is a value-added byproduct in the HNFB, we also measured ammonia Faradaic efficiencies under 100 mAcm <sup>2</sup> (Figure S41), which is a universal current density to reach the peak power densities when the hydrazine and nitrate sewage reaches relatively high concentrations (�0.1 M). The result indicates that the HNFB can achieve a high ammonia Faradaic efficiency of ca. 90% when the wastewater concentration is 0.05 M (Figure 4c). Nonetheless, the ammonia Faradaic efficiency gradually decreases to ca. 67% as the wastewater concentration increases to 1000 mM due to the substantial accumulation of nitrite and the short reaction time. Even so, the ammonia production efficiency of the HNFB is still higher than that of those N-containing pollutant-type batteries (Table S3). It is worth mentioning that the low wastewater concentration (e.g., 0.05 M) cannot support the continuous and steady operation of the HNFB and thus would reduce the output power densities (Figure S41). We further carried out a longterm stability test in the 0.1 M sewage. The HNFB can continuously operate for 20 h, along with the ammonia Faradaic efficiencies around 81% and the ammonia yield rates of ca. 0.38 mmolh <sup>1</sup> cm <sup>2</sup> under 100 mAcm <sup>2</sup> output (Figure 4d). The slight voltage decay might be ascribed to the peeling off of catalyst powder (Figure S42) and the electrolyte depletion, while the latter can be effectively recovered by renewing electrolytes. The produced ammonia fuel was subsequently collected in the distilled water to gain the final high purity ammonia solution via an air stripping technology (Figure S43).[11] As a result, the concentration of the obtained ammonia solution is ca. 0.62 M without other

foreign ions (determined by IC, Figure S44). It is also noted that although the traditional Haber-Bosch process displays a much higher ammonia production efficiency than the HNFB, it suffers from intense energy consumption and extensive greenhouse gases emission from fossil fuel combustion.[12]

To confirm the efficacy of the electricity supply of the HNFB, we also assembled a low-voltage-driven anion exchange membrane hydrazine electrolyzer (AEMHE), which used the bimetallic RuCo as both the anode and cathode for the HzOR and HER, respectively (Figure S45). The electrolyzer requires only a cell voltage of 0.229 V to reach 50 mAcm <sup>2</sup> , along with an outstanding stability for hydrogen production (after *iR* correction, Figure S46). Impressively, two tandem HNFBs can spontaneously drive the AEMHE with a H2 production rate up to 0.35 mmolh <sup>1</sup> cm <sup>2</sup> , corresponding to an 18.76 mAcm <sup>2</sup> output current density (Figures 4e and f, Movie S1). This result shows that the HNFB possesses great potential in electricity generation.

# *Conclusion*

In summary, we have proposed a general strategy to decontaminate wastewater and at the same time to generate both value-added fuels and electricity. Using hydrazine and nitrate effluents as a demonstration, we proposed a HNFB device that can deliver a peak power density of 12 mWcm <sup>2</sup> and continuously operate for 20 h under 100 mAcm <sup>2</sup> , accompanied with an ammonia yield rate of ca. 0.38 mmolh <sup>1</sup> cm <sup>2</sup> . Our work suggests an alternative green approach to wastewater purification and high value-added fuels production at low cost.

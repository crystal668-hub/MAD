## ABSTRACT

Direct hydrazine‐hydrogen peroxide fuel cells (DHzHPFCs) offer unique advantages for air‐independent applications, but their commercialization is impeded by the lack of high‐performance and low‐cost catalysts. This study reports a novel dual‐site Co‐Zn catalyst designed to enhance the hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) activity. Density functional theory calculations suggested that incorporating Zn into Co catalysts can weaken the binding strength of the crucial N2H3\* intermediate, which limits the rate‐ determining N2H3\* desorption step. The synthesized p‐Co9Zn1 catalyst exhibited a remarkably low reaction potential of −0.15 V versus RHE at 10 mA cm−<sup>2</sup> , outperforming monometallic Co catalysts. Experimental and computational analyses revealed dual active sites at the Co/ZnO interface, which facilitate N2H3\* desorption and subsequent N2H2\* formation. A liquid N2H4‐H2O2 fuel cell with p‐Co9Zn1 catalyst achieved a high open circuit voltage of 1.916 V and a maximum power density of 195 mW cm−<sup>2</sup> , demonstrating the potential application of the dual‐site Co‐Zn catalyst. This rational design strategy of tuning the N2H3\* binding energy through bimetallic interactions provides a pathway for developing efficient and economical non‐precious metal electrocatalysts for DHzHPFCs.

## 1 | Introduction

Direct hydrazine‐hydrogen peroxide fuel cells (DHzHPFCs) have long been recognized as unique power sources, particularly suitable for air‐independent applications in space and underwater environments [[1, 2](#page-7-0)]. Especially, employing hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as an oxidant resulted in a simplified internal structure of fuel cells [3[–](#page-7-1)5]. Given the higher theoretical electrode potential and kinetics of the hydrogen peroxide reduction reaction (HRR, 1.8 V vs. RHE) over those of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) [[6](#page-7-2)], using H2O2 as an alternative fuel to oxygen elevates the theoretical open circuit voltage (OCV, 2.13 V for DHzHPFC) of a single fuel cell and its power output [\[2, 3\]](#page-7-3).

While platinum (Pt) has been acknowledged as an active catalyst for both hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) [\[7, 8](#page-7-4)] and HRR [\[9, 10](#page-7-5)], its scarcity poses challenges for large‐scale applications in DHzHPFCs. Cobalt‐based catalysts have emerged as a viable alternative due to their low cost and decent catalytic activity in HzOR [\[11](#page-7-6)–14]. Previous studies have shown that the desorption of the N2H3\* intermediate and formation of N2H2\* is the rate‐determining step for HzOR on Co catalysts [[11, 15\]](#page-7-6). The relatively strong adsorption of N2H2\* on Co represents one

of the major energy barriers for the HzOR process. Dual-site catalysts, featuring distinct active sites tailored for different reaction steps, represent an effective strategy to improve electrocatalytic activity [16]. Constructing heterostructures [17, 18], designing diatomic catalysts [19, 20], introducing heteroatoms [21], or forming alloys [22, 23] are promising approaches to create dual active sites that can synergistically improve activity and selectivity.

In the present study, we aim to boost the activity of cobalt-based catalysts by optimizing the adsorption of the key reaction intermediate on dual-site catalysts for HzOR in DHzHPFCs. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that Zn exhibits a lower adsorption energy of the key intermediate N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub>\* than Co, which might help to accelerate the HzOR process on Co [15]. Guided by the theoretical prediction, dual-site Co-Zn catalysts were synthesized through plasma reduction of CoZn hydroxides. The assynthesized p-Co<sub>9</sub>Zn<sub>1</sub> catalyst demonstrated a remarkable overpotential of -0.15 V versus RHE at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, surpassing the monometallic p-Co(OH)2 catalyst. This enhanced intrinsic HzOR activity in p-Co<sub>9</sub>Zn<sub>1</sub>, attributed to the incorporation of Zn, is in line with the reduced energy barrier of HzOR manifested by theoretical calculations. Finally, we successfully demonstrate DHzHPFCs with a high OCV of 1.916V and a maximum power density of 195 mW cm<sup>-2</sup> at 80°C, highlighting the potential application of the Co-Zn catalyst.

#### 2 | Results and Discussion

## 2.1 | Theoretical Screening of Metallic Catalysts for HzOR

To search for Co-based catalysts with high activity, we conducted DFT calculations to assess the adsorption energies of  $N_2H_3^*$  on various metal surfaces (corresponding configurations displayed in Supporting Information S1: Figures S1 and S2). The adsorption energy of  $N_2H_3^*$  serves as a crucial parameter, facilitating the comprehension and comparative analysis of whether the incorporation of various elements into cobalt-based catalysts can effectively enhance the catalytic activity in HzOR [11, 15]. Figure 1 illustrates that the adsorption energies of  $N_2H_3^*$  on Zn  $(-2.0\,\text{eV})$  and Zr  $(-1.03\,\text{eV})$  were significantly lower than that on Co  $(-2.63\,\text{eV})$  (Supporting Information S1: Table S1). This observation suggests that incorporating Zn or Zr into Co catalysts

might mitigate the strong adsorption of  $N_2H_3^*$  on the Co surface, thus decreasing the reaction barrier of HzOR. Considering the substantial disparity in atomic radii and coordination structure between Zr and Co, incorporating Zn would be an experimentally feasible approach to modulate the activity of Co for HzOR.

# 2.2 | Synthesis and Structural Characterizations of Co-Zn Catalysts

To validate the theoretical predictions, we systematically synthesized Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> and CoZn hydroxides with varying ratios of Co and Zn (denoted as Co<sub>x</sub>Zn<sub>y</sub>, where x:y refers to the feed molar ratio of Co to Zn) as precursors using an electrosynthesis method, followed by H<sub>2</sub> plasma reduction (denoted as p-Co<sub>x</sub>Zn<sub>v</sub>). The layered hydroxide [24, 25] with ordered and uniform distribution of Co and Zn cations in the 2D layer ensures the homogeneous incorporation of Zn and Co (refer to Methods in Supplementary Information for details). Subsequently, linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) (Supporting Information S1: Figure S3) was employed to assess the HzOR performance of catalysts with different Zn/Co ratios. Among the catalysts, p-Co<sub>9</sub>Zn<sub>1</sub> exhibited the lowest onset potential and highest current density, affirming that the addition of Zn effectively enhances the HzOR performance of Co-based catalysts. The subsequent HzOR tests and characterizations of Co-Zn catalysts will focus on the sample synthesized with feeding Co:Zn molar ratio of 9:1.

The Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> and Co<sub>9</sub>Zn<sub>1</sub> hydroxide precursors exhibit similar X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns as depicted in Supporting Information S1: Figure S4a,b. Both patterns align closely with the standard pattern of  $\alpha$ -Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> (PDF# 51-1734). During the electrosynthesis, the Co<sub>9</sub>Zn<sub>1</sub> nanosheet arrays are formed as illustrated in Supporting Information S1: Figure S5a. Remarkably, following H<sub>2</sub> plasma reduction, p-Co<sub>9</sub>Zn<sub>1</sub> retains its nanosheet structure (Figure 2A). Transmission electron microscope (TEM) images and corresponding selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns of Co<sub>9</sub>Zn<sub>1</sub> and p-Co<sub>9</sub>Zn<sub>1</sub> are presented in Supporting Information S1: Figure S5b,c and Figure 2B-D. Both Co<sub>9</sub>Zn<sub>1</sub> and p-Co<sub>9</sub>Zn<sub>1</sub> nanosheets exhibit a polycrystalline structure. The high surface area of the nanosheet structure could increase the accessibility and exposure of active sites, thus improving the overall catalytic activity. Additionally, the open nanosheet architecture may facilitate mass transport of reactants and products, reducing diffusion limitations. High-resolution TEM (HRTEM) analysis of Co<sub>9</sub>Zn<sub>1</sub> (Supporting Information S1: Figure S5d) reveals its poor crystallinity. Notably, the high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) image, along with corresponding elemental mapping images of Co<sub>9</sub>Zn<sub>1</sub> (Supporting Information S1: Figure S5e,f), indicates a uniform distribution of Co and Zn elements throughout the nanosheet. The results from inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) analysis of Co<sub>9</sub>Zn<sub>1</sub> reveal mass fractions of 20% for Zn and 33.3% for Co. This observation underscores a notable Zn content in the Co-based catalysts. The difference between the feeding ratio and the measured ICP-MS ratio of Co and Zn in the electrodeposited catalysts can be attributed to the distinct chemical properties of each metal and the specific electrodeposition conditions employed. Upon plasma reduction, the phase undergoes transformation

to cobalt (PDF# 15-0806) and zinc oxide (PDF# 65-0523) (Supporting Information S1: Figure S4c). The crystallinity of p-Co $_9$ Zn $_1$  is improved (Figure 2E–G), revealing clear lattice fringes with interplanar distances of 0.098, 0.123, 0.106, and 0.106 nm, corresponding to ZnO (331), ZnO (222), Co (311), and Co (311) planes, respectively. Such polycrystalline array structure exhibits high surface area, offering abundant catalytic active sites. Furthermore, the homogeneous distribution of Zn, Co, and O elements throughout the entire nanosheet confirms the successful construction of a heterostructure composed of metallic Co and ZnO (Figure 2H,I).

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was employed to probe the changes in the chemical states of  $Co(OH)_2$ ,  $p\text{-}Co(OH)_2$ ,  $Co_9Zn_1$ , and  $p\text{-}Co_9Zn_1$ , as illustrated in Figure 3. Distinct  $Co^{2+}$  signals are observed in the XPS spectra of  $Co(OH)_2$ , whereas dominant signals of  $Co^0$  are evident in  $p\text{-}Co(OH)_2$  (Figure 3A). The peak positions align with the  $Co\ 2p_{3/2}$  signals of  $Co^{2+}$  (781.1 eV) and  $Co^0$  (777.9 eV) species. An additional  $Co\ 2p_{3/2}$  peak in  $p\text{-}Co(OH)_2$  at a lower binding energy (780.4 eV) originates from the surface oxidation of  $Co\$ in the air. The primary  $Co\$ 1 speak at 531.4 eV (Figure 3B) corresponds to metal hydroxides (531–532 eV). After plasma reduction, the  $Co\$ 1 speaks at 533.0, 531.4, and 529.38 eV are attributed to adsorbed water molecules, residual hydroxyl groups, and zinc oxide, respectively (Figure 3B,D). The change in valence states for  $Co\$ 6 (Figure 3C)

and O (Figure 3D) in  $\text{Co}_9\text{Z}\text{n}_1$  and p- $\text{Co}_9\text{Z}\text{n}_1$  is basically consistent with the variations observed in  $\text{Co}(\text{OH})_2$  and p- $\text{Co}(\text{OH})_2$ , affirming the transformation of the  $\text{Co}^{2+}$  in  $\text{Co}_9\text{Z}\text{n}_1$  to  $\text{Co}^0$  in p- $\text{Co}_9\text{Z}\text{n}_1$ , consistent with the XRD results.

Concerning the valence states of Zn, analysis employing Zn 2p and Auger Zn LMM XPS spectra was conducted. The XPS spectra of Zn 2p generally remain unaltered after plasma treatment (Figure 3E). Auger electron spectroscopy of Zn (Figure 3F) reveals that  $\text{Co}_9\text{Zn}_1$  exhibits only  $\text{Zn}^{2+}$  signals, while p- $\text{Co}_9\text{Zn}_1$  shows both  $\text{Zn}^{2+}$  and  $\text{Zn}^0$  signals. However, the XRD pattern exclusively indicates the existence of the ZnO phase, implying that the Zn<sup>0</sup> in p- $\text{Co}_9\text{Zn}_1$  results from the reduction of a small proportion of surface Zn atoms. The XPS results elucidate that the surface composition of p- $\text{Co}_9\text{Zn}_1$  predominantly comprises  $\text{Co}^0$ ,  $\text{Zn}^0$ , and  $\text{Zn}^{2+}$ .

## 2.3 | Electrochemical Performance of Catalysts for HzOR

The HzOR performances of the synthesized catalysts were meticulously assessed using a standard three-electrode configuration, with a Hg/HgO electrode as the reference electrode and a graphite rod as the counter electrode, immersed in a 1.0 M KOH electrolyte containing 0.1 M  $N_2H_4$ . LSV curves, presented in Figure 4A, were measured to evaluate the electrocatalytic

activity towards HzOR, and the corresponding Tafel plots are depicted in Figure 4B.

In this electrode configuration, the Ni foam substrate exhibited negligible catalytic activity, while Pt/C catalyst displayed a relatively high overpotential for HzOR ( $10\,\text{mA}\,\text{cm}^{-2}$  at  $\sim$   $-0.003\,\text{V}$  vs. RHE). Intriguingly, both  $\text{Co(OH)}_2$  and  $\text{Co}_9\text{Zn}_1$  demonstrated a lower overpotential than Pt/C ( $10\,\text{mA}\,\text{cm}^{-2}$  at  $\sim$   $-0.07\,\text{V}$  vs. RHE). However, they exhibited lower current density at high overpotential, which is probably attributed to the suboptimal conductivity and insufficient active sites inherent in hydroxide-based catalysts. Note that hydrazine hydrate in the electrolyte would simultaneously reduce hydroxides to certain

degree, thus the LSV curves of  $Co(OH)_2$  and  $Co_9Zn_1$  do not fully reflect their intrinsic catalytic activity.

Remarkably, after plasma treatment, p-Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> and p-Co<sub>9</sub>Zn<sub>1</sub> exhibited a notable improvement in catalytic activity. Specifically, p-Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> displayed a overpotential of  $-0.1\,V$  (vs. RHE at  $10\,\text{mA}\,\text{cm}^{-2}$ ) and a lower Tafel slope (30.04 mV dec $^{-1}$ ) compared to Co(OH)<sub>2</sub>. In the case of p-Co<sub>9</sub>Zn<sub>1</sub>, the overpotential shifted significantly to a negative value of  $-0.15\,V$  (vs. RHE) at  $10\,\text{mA}\,\text{cm}^{-2}$ , and the anodic current density rapidly increased to sub-ampere per cm² as the overpotential rose. An exceptionally small Tafel slope of  $15.65\,\text{mV}\,\text{dec}^{-1}$  was obtained, indicating rapid HzOR kinetics on p-Co<sub>9</sub>Zn<sub>1</sub>. The superior

performance of p-Co<sub>9</sub>Zn<sub>1</sub> than p-Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> underscores the pivotal role of Zn incorporation and plasma reduction in generating catalytically active sites for HzOR, revealing the significance of these factors in optimizing electrocatalytic activity.

The HzOR activities of the p-Co<sub>9</sub>Zn<sub>1</sub> electrode in electrolytes with varying hydrazine concentrations are presented in Figure 4C. The recorded LSV curves in different electrolyte concentrations overlap at low overpotential ( $-0.15 \sim -0.1 \, \text{V}$ ), indicating comparable reaction kinetics under small current densities irrespective of hydrazine concentration. However, at higher overpotential, the p-Co<sub>9</sub>Zn<sub>1</sub> electrode in electrolytes with high hydrazine concentrations exhibited significantly enhanced

current density, which suggests the mass-transfer limitation of HzOR at high current densities exceeding  $50\,\mathrm{mA\,cm^{-2}}$ .

To evaluate the intrinsic catalytic activity of the catalysts, the electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) was determined by measuring the double-layer capacitance ( $C_{\rm dl}$ ), as shown in Figure 4D and Supporting Information S1: Figure S6. Notably, the  $C_{\rm dl}$  of p-Co<sub>9</sub>Zn<sub>1</sub>/NF (34.56 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>) is substantially higher than that of Co<sub>9</sub>Zn<sub>1</sub>/NF (15.51 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>). Similarly, p-Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> also exhibits a higher  $C_{\rm dl}$  (52.33 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>) compared to Co (OH)<sub>2</sub> (6.66 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>), probably due to the formation of porous structure during the plasma treatment. The large  $C_{\rm dl}$  of Pt/C is likely attributed to the high specific surface area of carbon

support. The ECSA-normalized current density, displayed in Supporting Information S1: Figure S7, highlights the superior intrinsic electrocatalytic performance of  $p\text{-}Co_9Zn_1$  among the investigated catalysts. Hence, the  $H_2$  plasma treatment and the incorporation of Zn are pivotal factors in constructing abundant highly active catalytic sites for HzOR.

The stability of p-Co<sub>9</sub>Zn<sub>1</sub> electrode was systematically assessed through a chronopotentiometry test conducted at a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, as depicted in Figure 4E. Following a continuous 30-hour measurement, a small potential drop of 30 mV was observed, indicative of the decent stability of the electrode. After electrolysis, the XPS spectra of p-Co<sub>9</sub>Zn<sub>1</sub> (Supporting Information S1: Figure S8a,b) unveiled a subtle shift in the Co 2p<sub>3/2</sub> peak. This shift implies a minor oxidation of Co on the surface, leading to the formation of Co(OH)<sub>X</sub>/CoO<sub>X</sub> during the HzOR [26, 27]. Notably, the valence states of O and Zn in p-Co<sub>9</sub>Zn<sub>1</sub> remained unchanged after long-term test. The loss of catalytic active Co<sup>0</sup> species as well as detachment of active component from the electrode might be the main reason for the performance degradation.

When compared with previously documented HzOR catalysts (see Figure 4F and Supporting Information S1: Table S2), p-Co<sub>9</sub>Zn<sub>1</sub>/NF demonstrates notably superior characteristics. Notably, it displays the lowest onset potential at  $10\,\mathrm{mA\,cm^{-2}}$  (-0.15 V vs. RHE), as well as a low overpotential at  $200\,\mathrm{mA\,cm^{-2}}$  (-0.02 V vs. RHE), coupled with a remarkable electrolysis stability. The outstanding performance of the Co-Zn bimetallic catalyst underscores the effectiveness of our catalyst design strategy.

## 2.4 | Mechanistic Insights of Co-Zn Catalysts for HzOR

We conducted comprehensive DFT calculations to elucidate the HzOR process on Co-Zn electrocatalysts. Two pathways, namely alternating (path 1) and distal (path 2) configurations of adsorbed  $N_2H_2^*$ , were considered in our simulations. Experimental results reveal the presence of  $Zn^{2+}$  and  $Zn^0$  on the surface of p-Co<sub>9</sub>Zn<sub>1</sub> catalyst, both of which might participate in forming the catalytic active sites. Considering the dominant ZnO phase in the catalyst, a simplified model is used to represent the structure of p-Co<sub>9</sub>Zn<sub>1</sub> for theoretical calculations, where a ZnO (111) surface with a cobalt cluster was constructed

and denoted as Co/ZnO (see computational model in Supporting Information S1: Figure S9a,b). For comparison, DFT calculations of the HzOR process were also performed on Co (111) and Pt (111) surfaces (see computational model in Supporting Information S1: Figure S10a,h).

The complete free energy diagrams for the HzOR were calculated to investigate the reaction thermodynamics on dual-site Co-Zn catalyst (Figure 5A). Supporting Information S1: Tables S3 and S4 provide the free-energy changes of the elementary reactions, while Supporting Information S1: Figures S9 and S10 present the configurations of intermediates on catalyst surfaces. Notably, the intermediate species were found to bond with both Co and Zn atoms on the dual-site Co/ZnO surface. Our results indicate that Co/ZnO exhibits a preference for the alternating pathway, Pt (111) favors the distal pathway, and Co (111) demonstrates similar overpotential for both pathways. The dehydrogenation of N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub>\* is identified as the potential-determining step on both Co/ZnO and Pt (111), with energy barriers of 0.28 and 0.48 eV, respectively. As for Co (111), the dehydrogenation of N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub>\* and N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>\* exhibits identical energy barriers of 0.44 eV. Thus, Co/ZnO with the lowest energy barrier for the dehydrogenation of N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub>\* emerges as the most active catalyst for HzOR. The comparison between theoretical and experimental onset potential, presented in Figure 5B, confirms the reliability of our simulations. The theoretical onset potential of Co/ZnO at -0.05 V (vs. RHE) is lower than that of both Co (111) and Pt (111), consistent with our experimental results. This discrepancy in onset potential arises from the varying energy barriers of dehydrogenation of N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub>\* on different surfaces.

The  $N_2H_3^*$  adsorption energy on Co/ZnO was calculated as  $-2.51\,\text{eV}$ , lower than that on Co (111) ( $-2.63\,\text{eV}$ ) and ZnO (111) ( $-3.23\,\text{eV}$ ). This aligns with our hypothesis that the incorporation of Zn in Co-based catalysts could attenuate the strong bonding between Co and  $N_2H_3^*$ . Importantly, the strong adsorption energy of  $N_2H_3^*$  on ZnO (111) excludes the possibility of HzOR active sites on the surface of ZnO. The differential charge density in Supporting Information S1: Figure S11 further indicates a significant electron transfer between Co and Zn at the interface, optimizing the adsorption energy of  $N_2H_3^*$ . The adjacent ZnO sites then modify the desorption of the  $N_2H_3^*$  intermediate of Co sites with a significant electron transfer between Co and ZnO at the interface. In contrast, on a pure metal catalyst, the adsorption and desorption of the  $N_2H_3^*$  intermediate could be more challenging. Our Gibbs energy

calculations elucidate that the dual-site Co-Zn sites at the Co/ZnO interface serve as the active sites for HzOR, with an optimal  $\rm N_2H_3^*$  adsorption energy. The consistency of experimental and calculated results validates our catalyst design strategy and prediction, opening avenues for the development of highly active catalysts.

## 2.5 | Assembly and Performance of DHzHPFC

The as-developed  $p\text{-}Co_9Zn_1$  catalyst was further used to assemble DHzHPFC for the demonstration of practical applications. The electrode reactions and working mechanism of the DHzHPFC are schematically shown in Figure 6A. During the

<span id="page-6-1"></span>oxidation of  $N_2H_4$  to  $N_2$ ,  $H_2O_2$  is concurrently reduced to  $H_2O$ . As electrons transfer from the anode to the cathode,  $K^+$ —the primary charge carrier—moves in the opposite direction through a Nafion membrane [28]. The anodic, cathodic, and overall cell reactions are described by Equations (1)–(3).

Anode: 
$$N_2H_4 + 4OH^- \rightarrow N_2 + 4H_2O + 4e^-$$
  
 $E^0 = -0.33 \text{ V vs. RHE}$  (1)

Cathode: 
$$2H_2O_2 + 4H^+ + 4e^- \rightarrow 4H_2O$$
  
 $E^0 = 1.8 \text{ V vs. RHE}$  (2)

<span id="page-6-2"></span>Total: 
$$N_2H_4 + 2H_2O_2 \rightarrow N_2 + 4H_2O$$
  $E = 2.13 V$  (3)

DHzHPFC was assembled using p-Co<sub>9</sub>Zn<sub>1</sub>/NF as the anode and Pt/C-coated carbon paper as the cathode. Pt/C was also tested as the anode catalyst for comparison (see Methods for preparation of electrodes). In these experiments, mixtures of (0.5 M  $H_2SO_4 + 2.0 \text{ M } H_2O_2$ ) and  $(2.0 \text{ M } \text{KOH} + 1.0 \text{ M } \text{N}_2H_4)$  served as the catholyte and anolyte, respectively. Current-voltage (I-V) characteristics at different operation temperatures were shown in Figure 6B and Supporting Information S1: Figure S12, illustrating temperature-dependent variations. Notably, the open-circuit voltage (OCV) of DHzHPFCs remained consistent at different temperatures, while the power density increased with rising temperature. This behavior is attributed to enhanced kinetics of anodic and cathodic reactions and improved electrolyte conductivity at higher temperatures [29, 30]. The OCV of the cell using p-Co<sub>9</sub>Zn<sub>1</sub> (1.916 V) exceeded that of Pt/C (1.64 V), highlighting the high intrinsic activity of p-Co<sub>9</sub>Zn<sub>1</sub>. At 80°C, p-Co<sub>9</sub>Zn<sub>1</sub> exhibited a significantly higher maximum power density (195 mW cm<sup>-2</sup>) compared to Pt/C (106 mW cm<sup>-2</sup>), indicating superior reaction activity and kinetics for p-Co<sub>9</sub>Zn<sub>1</sub>-assembled DHzHPFC.

To assess the electrochemical stability of the p-Co<sub>9</sub>Zn<sub>1</sub>assembled DHzHPFC, the cell output voltage was investigated over time at 25 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> and 50°C (Figure 6C). The results showed fluctuations in the cell potential due to the production of oxygen and hydrogen from H2O2 and N2H4 decomposition in the cathodic and anodic compartments, respectively. The output voltage of the DHzHPFC remains generally stable with slight degradation during the operation. The polarization and power density curves revealed a decrease in maximum power density from 102 to 95 mW cm<sup>-2</sup> (50°C) after over 4 h of stability test (Figure 6D). While acknowledging the need for further investigation and improvement in the long-term durability of the as-prepared catalyst and DHzHPFCs, our results suggest that the catalytic activity of p-Co<sub>9</sub>Zn<sub>1</sub> for N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> electrooxidation remains relatively stable in DHzHPFCs.

Comparisons with literature reports of DHzHPFCs operated under similar conditions (Figure 6E and Supporting Information S1: Table S6), our work demonstrates the excellent performance of the DHzHPFC assembled with a  $p\text{-}Co_9Zn_1$  electrode, particularly in terms of OCV and maximal power output. The OCV of our  $p\text{-}Co_9Zn_1$ -assembled DHzHPFC surpasses previously reported DHzHPFCs, indicating the excellent intrinsic HzOR activity of our  $p\text{-}Co_9Zn_1$  catalyst.

#### 3 | Conclusion

This study presents a rational catalyst design strategy for enhancing the HzOR activity in DHzHPFCs. Guided by DFT calculations, zinc was incorporated into cobalt-based catalysts to weaken the binding strength of the critical  $N_2H_3^{\ast}$  intermediate, which limits the rate-determining  $N_2H_3^{\ast}$  desorption step. The synthesized p-Co<sub>9</sub>Zn<sub>1</sub> catalyst exhibits the optimal performance, displaying a remarkably low overpotential of  $-0.15\,V$  (vs. RHE) at  $10\,\text{mA}\,\text{cm}^{-2}$  and an impressive Tafel slope of  $15.65\,\text{mV}$  dec $^{-1}$ . Experimental and computational analyses suggest that both Zn and Co atoms on the Co/ZnO interface serve as catalytically active sites for HzOR. The successful incorporation of Zn plays a pivotal

role in balancing the adsorption energy of  $N_2H_3^*$ . DHzHPFC using p-Co<sub>9</sub>Zn<sub>1</sub> as anode catalyst achieved an exceptional open circuit voltage of 1.916 V, underscoring the intrinsic activity of Co-Zn catalyst. This work validates the strategy of tuning the  $N_2H_3^*$  binding energy through dual-site interactions, advancing the fundamental understanding of hydrazine electrooxidation on cobalt catalysts.

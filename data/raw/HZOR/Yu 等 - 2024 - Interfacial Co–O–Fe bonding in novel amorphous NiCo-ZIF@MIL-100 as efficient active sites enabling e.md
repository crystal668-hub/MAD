# Interfacial Co-O-Fe bonding in novel amorphous NiCo-ZIF@MIL-100 as efficient active sites enabling electrocatalytic water oxidation†

Tianhao Yu,<sup>a</sup> Peng Gao,<sup>a</sup> Hong Du<sup>b\*ab</sup> and Ling Dong\*a

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have recently been reported as promising catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Hence, we chose hydroxyl-rich 2,5-dihydroxyterephthalic acid as the ligand to prepare a novel MIL-100 and wrapped it on the NiCo-ZIF-67 surface to obtain an amorphous hollow material (NiCo-ZIF-67@Fe-MIL-100, denoted as NiCo-ZIF@MIL). The composite material presents a low overpotential ( $\eta \approx 139$  mV @ 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>), a small Tafel slope (119 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>) and great stability for the OER in 1 M KOH solution. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations show that the hydroxyl-rich structure, which accelerates OH<sup>-</sup> transfer and promotes the formation of the Co-O-Fe bridge, effectively reduces the reaction energy barrier (from 2.67 eV for NiCo-ZIF-67 to 2.08 eV for NiCo-ZIF@MIL). This work provides an important reference for the development of double-MOF materials.

#### Introduction

In order to address the environmental issues and energy crises brought on by the excessive use of fossil fuels, people have begun to look for clean energy sources, and hydrogen energy is a great substitute for fossil fuels.1 An effective means of converting energy is through electrochemical decomposition of water.2 Anodic oxygen evolution (OER) and cathodic hydrogen evolution (HER) are both components of the water electrolysis reaction.<sup>3</sup> The OER is crucial for storing and converting energy. The complicated OER reaction steps limit the total reaction rate of electrochemical water decomposition.4 Due to the slow transfer of multi-step proton-coupled electrons, the fourelectron transfer process of the anodic OER (4OH $^- \rightarrow 2H_2O +$ O<sub>2</sub> + 4e<sup>-</sup>) requires a large overpotential.<sup>5</sup> Currently, traditional noble metal oxides (e.g., RuO2 and IrO2) exhibit high OER catalytic activity. However, due to their exceedingly high price, instability, and rarity, the widespread applicability of these metals is constrained.7 Therefore, it is of vital significance to develop economical, efficient, abundant, and stable OER catalysts.8 In general, transition metal oxides,9 sulfides,10 and phosphides11 are effective catalytic materials for the OER. As a promising new electrochemical material, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have been widely studied in recent years. They feature a large surface area, tunable pores, large number of redox-active metal centers, and a variety of uses (such as drug-

sustained release, molecular separation, and gas storage).12 The MOF series is mainly divided into isoreticular metalorganic frameworks (IRMOFs), zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs), and Materials Institute Lavoisier (MILs). Among them, ZIF series materials can give rise to a variety of ZIF structures simply by adjusting the types of metal ions and ligands. ZIFs have a microporous structure and a huge specific surface area, which make this kind of material highly stable.13 In recent years, the Yaghi group reported the synthesis of ZIFs by the solvothermal method and obtained dozens of caged ZIF materials with different topological structures.14 Guo et al. synthesized ZIF-67 using a room-temperature static method with excellent catalytic performance. At a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, the overpotential was 408 mV and the Tafel slope was 128.2 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>.15 Wang et al. effectively produced ZIF-67 by a co-precipitation technique with an overpotential of 530 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. The catalytic performance of single ZIF materials is not satisfactory and different attempts have been made to improve the catalytic performance of the materials, such as metal cation doping and construction of heterojunctions. After doping ZIF-67 with Cu element, A. Parkash synthesized Cu-ZIF-67 catalysts showing excellent catalytic performance. At the current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, the overpotential was 370 mV.17 Li et al. designed the core-shell heterostructure Co-LDH@ZIF-67 ( $\eta_{10} = 187$  mV), which exhibited excellent OER catalytic activity and stability due to the interaction of ZIF-67 with the heterogeneous interface of Co-LDH, the porous structure, and large specific surface area.18 Zhu et al. coated a molecule with  $\pi$ -orbital conjugation on the pristine ZIF-67 via a solvothermal method. Due to the conductivity of the  $\pi$ -orbital coupled molecules, the composites exhibited

remarkable electron transfer capability and excellent redox activity. The obtained composite presented an excellent lower overpotential (238 mV) and Tafel slope 104 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>.19 Li et al. reported the synthesis of polyoxometalate (POM) nanoparticles coated with ZIF-67, denoted as ZIF-67@POM. The overpotential and Tafel slope of the ZIF-67@POM sample were only 287 mV and 58 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>, respectively at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> due to the high specific surface area and synergistic effect between ZIF-67 and POM.20

Fe-MIL-100, constructed using 1,3,5-benzene tricarboxylic acid and octahedral FeO6, not only possesses the porous structure of the MOF materials but also exhibits high stability and excellent catalytic ability due to the existence of highvalence metal ions.21 Li et al. synthesized Fe-MIL-100 on threedimensional nickel foam (NF) by a solvothermal process. The overpotential of the obtained Fe-MIL-100/NF was 420 mV with the Tafel slope value of 53.3 mV dec<sup>-1</sup> at the current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>.<sup>22</sup> Zhao et al. reduced the overpotential by 52 mV after anchoring Ag nanoparticles (NPs) to MIL-100/NF. The high OER catalytic activity was due to the enhanced charge transfer and exposing more active sites after loading Ag NPs.23 Compared to single MOF materials, dual-MOF materials tend to exhibit higher catalytic activity, due to the fact that the multiphase structure of the double-MOF composites exposes more active sites, and the synergistic interaction between the composites enhances the charge transfer ability, optimizes the conversion of oxygen-containing intermediates, and reduces the free energy, thus improving the catalytic performance of the materials.24-27 In general, MIL-100 is synthesized with benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylic acid as a ligand. Since the hydroxyl group could construct defects and modify the active sites to promote the adsorption of OH and oxygen-containing intermediates, which improves the OER activity, 28 we chose a hydroxyl dimer as the ligand to prepare Fe-MIL-100.

Hence, we used a hydrothermal method to grow Fe-MIL-100 with 2,5-dihydroxyterephthalic acid (H<sub>4</sub>DODBC) as a ligand in situ on the surface of NiCo-ZIF-67 to obtain the double MOF heterostructure NiCo-ZIF-67@Fe-MIL-100 (denoted as NiCo-ZIF@MIL). The overpotential was as low as 139 mV and the Tafel slope was 125 mV dec<sup>-1</sup> at a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. LSV time-current curves before and after 1000 cycles demonstrate the superior stability of NiCo-ZIF@MIL. The excellent OER activity of NiCo-ZIF@MIL could be ascribed primarily to the synergistic effect between Fe and Co sites. According to experimental investigation and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the charge redistribution around Fe and Co induced the adsorption of reaction media containing oxygen on the Co-O-Fe bridge structure, thus enhancing the catalytic OER properties. The utilization of double MOF materials as potential catalysts for advancing research on energy conversion devices will be made possible by this work.

# Experimental section

#### Materials and reagents

Cobalt nitrate hexahydrate (Co(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>·6H<sub>2</sub>O, AR), iron nitrate nonahydrate (Fe(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>·9H<sub>2</sub>O, AR), nickel nitrate hexahydrate

(Ni(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>·6H<sub>2</sub>O, AR), 2-methylimidazole (2-MIM, AR), methanol (CH<sub>3</sub>OH, AR), ethanol (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OH, AR), H<sub>4</sub>DODBC (AR), polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP, AR), potassium chloride (KCl, AR), potassium hydroxide(KOH, AR) and Nafion solution (5 wt%) were bought from Aladdin (Shanghai, China).

#### Preparation of NiCo-ZIF-67

Solution A was obtained by mixing Co(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>·6H<sub>2</sub>O (0.5821 g, 2 mmol) with Ni(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>·6H<sub>2</sub>O (0.1454 g, 0.5 mmol) plus 50 mL of methanol. Solution B was obtained by dissolving 2-MIM (1.6222 g, 19.75 mmol) in 50 mL of methanol. Solution A was poured into solution B. Stirring of the liquid mixture was continued for 0.5 h. After standing for 24 h, the solution was washed five times with methanol by centrifugation and dried in an oven at 60 °C for 16 h to obtain NiCo-ZIF-67.

#### Synthesis of NiCo-ZIF@MIL composites and Fe-MIL-100 (MIL)

In a typical process,  $Fe(NO_3)_3 \cdot 9H_2O$  (0.0316 g, 0.08 mmol), H<sub>4</sub>DODBC (0.0396 g, 0.2 mmol), NiCo-ZIF-67 (0.0315 g, 0.14 mmol), PVP (0.003 g) and ethanol (14 mL) were mixed in a 25 mL glass container and the mixture was stirred to form a homogeneous solution. Subsequently, the reaction mixture was placed in a 25 mL autoclave and heated to 100 °C for 12 h. After cooling down to room temperature, the product was washed three times with ethanol and dried at 60 °C for 12 h to obtain NiCo-ZIF@MIL, denoted as NiCo-ZIF@MIL (1:2). The ratios of  $n(\text{NiCo-ZIF-67}): n(\text{Fe}(\text{NO}_3)_3 \cdot 9\text{H}_2\text{O} + \text{H}_4\text{DODBC})$  were adjusted to 2:1, 1:1 and 1:3 to prepare different ratios of materials. Fe-MIL-100 (MIL-100) was prepared by the same method as NiCo-ZIF@MIL, but NiCo-ZIF-67 was absent.

#### Characterization and measurement

The X-ray diffraction patterns (XRD) were recorded on an X'Pert PRO MPD X-ray powder diffractometer to characterize the samples' crystal structures. The morphology and composition of samples were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi Regulus 8100), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM, 100I Tecnai F20). Xray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, EscaLab 250 Xi) was used to analyze the chemical composition and surface electronic structure of the materials. The structures and properties of the functional groups of materials were characterized by Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and Raman spectroscopy (Raman, LabRAM HR Evolution). Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA, PerkinElmer STA 6000) were carried out in a nitrogen atmosphere with a heating rate of 10  $^{\circ}\mathrm{C}\ \mathrm{min^{-1}}$  and a maximum temperature of 800 °C.

The electrochemical measurements in this study were carried out on an electrochemical workstation (CHI660E) using a three-electrode system with N2 saturated 1 M KOH. In the three-electrode system, a glassy carbon electrode, a platinum electrode, and an Ag/AgCl electrode were used as the working electrode, the counter electrode, and the reference electrode, respectively. The electrocatalyst dispersion was prepared as follows: 0.0065 g of sample was added to 1 mL of ethanol and sonicated for 20 min, then 100 µL of Nafion (5 wt%) was added

and sonicated for 1 h to obtain a homogeneously dispersed mixture. Finally, 10  $\mu$ L of the solution was dropped on a glassy carbon electrode and dried naturally at room temperature. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves of all samples were measured at a sweep rate of 10 mV s<sup>-1</sup>. The electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) was measured in the voltage range of 1.48–1.57 V and in the sweep rate range of 20–100 mV s<sup>-1</sup>. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements of all electrocatalysts were performed at open circuit voltage. The stability of the LSV curve of the sample was investigated by conducting CV (1000 cycles) in 1 M KOH at a scanning rate of 10 mV s<sup>-1</sup>. And the time–current curve of the sample was measured for 10 h.

#### Calculation method

In the CP2K code, we carried out spin-polarized density functional theory (DFT) calculations using mixed Gaussian and plane wave basis sets. The core-electron and the exchangecorrelation functional were described by norm-conserving Goedecker-Teter-Hutter pseudopotentials and the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional, respectively. The Brillouin zone integration is performed using a 1  $\times$  1  $\times$  1  $\Gamma$ -centered Monkhorst-Pack-mesh. The cut-off energy is 360 eV and vacuum layer thickness is 15 Å. All configurations were investigated by employing the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BGFS) algorithm with the SCF convergence criterion of 1.0  $\times$ 10<sup>-6</sup> au. We simulated the OER process by considering 4-step adsorption of intermediates. The Gibbs free reaction energy  $(\Delta G)$  was calculated from the binding strengths between the catalyst and the OER intermediates ( $\Delta G = \Delta E + \Delta ZPE - T\Delta S$ ), where  $\Delta E$  is the DFT calculated adsorption energy of the intermediate;  $\Delta$ ZPE is the zero-point energy;  $\Delta$ S is the change in entropy.

#### Results and discussion

A schematic illustration of the synthetic process of the NiCo-ZIF@MIL heterostructure is provided in Scheme 1. In brief, the synthesis of NiCo-ZIF@MIL was carried out *via* a two-step approach, involving a stewing method in methanol solution and hydrothermal synthesis (as illustrated in Scheme 1). The specific synthesis process and details are given in the Experimental section.

The XRD patterns of NiCo-ZIF, MIL-100, and NiCo-ZIF@MIL (1:2) are shown in Fig. 1a. The XRD graph of NiCo-ZIF@MIL

(1:2) shows that the peaks at 7.32°, 10.36°, 12.68°, 14.69°, and 16.36° are attributed to NiCo-ZIF, and those at 25.66° and 28.86° are attributed to MIL-100, which proves that the composite material was successfully prepared by combining NiCo-ZIF and MIL-100.29,30 The standard card of NiCo-ZIF (JCPDS: 671073) and the simulation card of MIL-100 are shown in ESI Fig. S1.† The TG analyses of NiCo-ZIF, MIL-100, and NiCo-ZIF@MIL (1:2) are shown in Fig. 1b. NiCo-ZIF exhibits a slight mass loss below 500 °C, which may be due to the removal of solvent and physically adsorbed water. Further increase in temperature leads to structural collapse of NiCo-ZIF. The DTG peak for the decomposition of the NiCo-ZIF skeleton is 519.64 °C, which is lower than that of ZIF-67 (ESI, Fig. S2a†).31 This indicates that the doping of Ni in ZIF-67 could accelerate the decomposition. The stable residue mass of NiCo-ZIF is 47.62%. MIL-100 has a three-stage weight loss phase. From room temperature to 155 °C, dissociation of solvent and adsorbed water resulted in a mass loss of 11.40%. From 155 °C to about 520 °C, there is a sustained mass loss of 42.05%, which could be attributed to the decomposition of H<sub>4</sub>DODBC. As shown in ESI Fig. S2b,† the DTG peak at 240.42 °C for the decomposition of H<sub>4</sub>DODBC is similar to that of the literature.<sup>32</sup> The loss of material due to the complete collapse of the MIL-100 framework is 17.94% from 520 °C to 800 °C. The DTG peak for this step is 563.11 °C, which is higher than that of the conventional MIL-100,33,34 suggesting that the bonding of Fe with the H<sub>4</sub>DODBC ligand results in better stability. The residue weight of MIL-100 is 28.60%. For NiCo-ZIF@MIL (1:2), there are three main stages of weight loss. Firstly, the free water and solvent loss in the material is 16.40% when the temperature rises to about 190 °C. Second, from 190 °C to 390 °C, the mass loss is 22.08% due to the pyrolysis of H<sub>4</sub>DOBDC. Finally, between 390 °C and 800 °C, the structural collapse of NiCo-ZIF@MIL (1:2) results in a dramatic decrease in mass fraction with a loss of 31.6%. As shown in ESI Fig. S2c,† the DTG for the decomposition of H<sub>4</sub>DODBC was elevated to 312.99 °C, 32,34 which is higher than that of bare MIL-100, suggesting that NiCo-ZIF and MIL-100 samples interact with each other. The residue mass of NiCo-ZIF@MIL (1:2) is 30.02%.

Fig. 2a shows the FT-IR spectrum, providing more detailed information about the synthesized structure. The peaks of NiCo-ZIF are consistent with those reported in the literature, further indicating the successful synthesis of NiCo-ZIF. <sup>35,36</sup> For MIL-100, the peak at 1649 cm<sup>-1</sup> corresponds to the stretching vibration of the C=O acid ligand, suggesting that the carboxyl

The peaks are assigned as follows: 1 represents the stretching vibration of C=O; 2 represents the framework vibration of benzene ring; 3 and 4 represent the stretching vibration of C-O; 5 and 6 represent the out-ofplane bending vibration of C-H on the benzene ring.

group in H<sub>4</sub>DODBC is deprotonated and then coordinated with Fe<sup>3+</sup> to form Fe-MIL-100.<sup>37</sup> In the FT-IR spectrum of NiCo-ZIF@MIL (1:2), the disappearance of characteristic peaks of NiCo-ZIF may be due to the coating with MIL-100. The stretching vibration of C=O, the framework vibration of the benzene ring, the stretching vibration of C-O, and the out-ofplane bending vibration of C-H on the benzene ring were attributed to MIL-100.38 The variation in the intensity of these peaks may be due to the interaction between MIL-100 and NiCo-ZIF. The appearance of the Co-O peak (581 cm<sup>-1</sup>) further indicates a strong interaction of double MOF.32 The Raman graphs of NiCo-ZIF, MIL-100, and NiCo-ZIF@MIL (1:2) are shown in Fig. 2b. The distinct vibrational peaks of NiCo-ZIF are consistent with the published literature, indicating its successful synthesis.39 The peaks of NiCo-ZIF@MIL (1:2) and MIL-100 are highly similar, which may be due to the uniform coating of MIL-100 on NiCo-ZIF. However, in the Raman spectrum of NiCo-ZIF@MIL (1:2), the negative shift of the benzene ring vibration (573 cm<sup>-1</sup>) and the C=O stretching (1286 cm<sup>-1</sup>), the positive shift of -COO<sup>-</sup> (1447 cm<sup>-1</sup>) and the C=C vibration (1612 cm<sup>-1</sup>), and the appearance of the Co-O bond (813 cm<sup>-1</sup>)

may be due to the interaction between NiCo-ZIF and MIL-100,40-42 which is consistent with the FTIR results.

From the SEM images, it can be seen that NiCo-ZIF presents a uniform dodecahedral morphology with a smooth surface (Fig. 3a). After compounding with MIL-100, the NiCo-ZIF@MIL (1:2) sample exhibits polyhedral morphology with a rough surface due to the deposition of MIL-100 particles on the surface of NiCo-ZIF (Fig. 3b). The rough surface not only facilitates electrolyte penetration but also avoids the aggregation of catalysts during the catalysis process, which is advantageous for the catalytic properties.43 Comparison of the morphology of NiCo-ZIF and NiCo-ZIF@MIL (1:2), as shown in Fig. 3c and d, shows that NiCo-ZIF@MIL (1:2) still retains the morphology of NiCo-ZIF, but the angles are no longer distinct and there are particles attached, suggesting that MIL-100 grows on the surface of NiCo-ZIF. It could be observed that a clear interface formed between NiCo-ZIF and MIL-100 as seen in the HRTEM image (Fig. 3e), which proves that the NiCo-ZIF@MIL (1:2) heterostructure was successfully prepared. However, no lattice fringes are found, indicating that the composite is amorphous. The amorphous materials could expose much more atoms

acting as active sites for catalysis than their crystalline counterparts at the same mass, leading to the higher catalytic performance of the amorphous materials.<sup>44</sup> The corresponding elemental mapping images (Fig. 3f) show that C, N, O, Co, Ni, and Fe elements are uniformly distributed throughout the particles.

As shown in Fig. 4a, the full XPS spectrum of NiCo-ZIF@MIL (1:2) proves that the heterogeneous structure consists of C, N, O, Fe Co, and Ni elements, which is in agreement with the elemental mapping results. The full XPS spectra of NiCo-ZIF

and MIL-100 are presented in ESI Fig. S3a.† In the XPS pattern of C 1s, the peaks situated at 284.16, 285.43 and 287.58 eV could correspond to the C-C, C-N, and O-C=O bonds, respectively (Fig. 4b).  $^{23,24}$  In addition, the peak at 290.63 eV refers to the  $\pi$ - $\pi$ \* satellite peak due to the presence of a large number of  $\pi$ -electrons in the aromatic ring.  $^{45}$  Compared with ESI Fig. S3b,† the characteristic peaks at 287.87 eV (O-C=O) of MIL-100 and 285.76 eV (C-N) of NiCo-ZIF remain in the NiCo-ZIF@MIL (1:2) as shown in Fig. 4b, which indicates that MIL-100 and NiCo-ZIF had been incorporated successfully. As

shown in Fig. 4c of the O 1s XPS spectrum, it could be shown that the dominant peaks of NiCo-ZIF@MIL (1:2) originate from the O-H (532.3 eV), C-C=O (531.16 eV), and O-M (530.48 eV).23,27 Additionally, this interaction between NiCo-ZIF and MIL-100 affects the coordination environment of O, which leads to obvious shifts of binding energies (compared with ESI Fig. S3c†). Fig. 4d exhibits the N 1s XPS spectra, the binding energies of 398.86 eV and 400.49 eV represent typical imidazole-N and C=N signals in NiCo-ZIF@MIL (1:2), respectively. The characteristic peaks at 398.62 eV (imidazole-N) and 399.85 eV (C=N) of NiCo-ZIF are slightly offset in NiCo-ZIF@MIL (1:2), which may be caused by the interaction of NiCo-ZIF and MIL-100.25 As shown in Fig. 4e, the results in the case of NiCo-ZIF@MIL (1:2) prove the co-existence of Co3+ (780.55 eV and 796.19 eV) and Co<sup>2+</sup> (782.43 eV and 797.62 eV) by indicating double spin-orbit for  $2p_{3/2}$  and  $2p_{1/2}$ . The peaks at 785.07, 788.26, 800.76, and 803.68 eV of NiCo-ZIF@MIL (1:2) are attributed to the satellite peaks of Co. The Fe region in Fig. 4f features double spin-orbit at 710.39 eV and 723.08 eV for Fe<sup>2+</sup>  $2p_{3/2}$  and  $2p_{1/2}$  and the peaks at 713.16 eV and 725.94 eV correspond to the Fe<sup>3+</sup>  $2p_{3/2}$  and  $2p_{1/2}$  in NiCo-ZIF@MIL (1:2), respectively. The peaks at 716.20, 719.20, 728.76, and 729.45 eV of NiCo-ZIF@MIL (1:2) are attributed to the satellite peaks of Fe. In addition, the peak positions of Co 2p in NiCo-ZIF@MIL (1:2) exhibit an obvious negative shift compared to NiCo-ZIF, implying a high charge density around Co. In comparison to MIL-100, the peaks of Fe 2p in NiCo-ZIF@MIL (1:2) reveal a positive shift, which suggests a lower charge density surrounding Fe. It is obvious that the combination of MIL-100 and NiCo-ZIF may lead to Fe 2p acting as electron donating sites and the electrons will be transferred from Fe 2p sites to the Co 2p sites. This further proves that MIL-100 and NiCo-ZIF would form a heterogeneous interface, which is advantageous to modify the electronic structure to enhance the catalytic

performance when electron transfer happens at the heterogeneous interface.26 The change of binding energy of Co and Fe reveals the interaction between MIL-100 and NiCo-ZIF. The results further prove the successful preparation of the NiCo-ZIF@MIL heterostructure.

As shown in Fig. 5a and ESI Fig. S4a,† all NiCo-ZIF@MIL electrodes exhibit a lower overpotential compared with that of bare NiCo-ZIF (~439 mV) and bare MIL-100 (~475 mV) at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, owing to the rich interfaces illustrated by the structural characterization studies. Typically, NiCo-ZIF@MIL (1:2) exhibits the lowest  $\eta_{10}$  of 139 mV and outperforms commercial RuO<sub>2</sub> (366 mV), which is better than that of many reported OER electrocatalysts, as exhibited in Table S1 in the ESI,† indicating that NiCo-ZIF@MIL (1:2) exhibits superior OER catalytic performance. Additionally, the Tafel slope is a key kinetic parameter describing the electrochemical reaction process.46 The corresponding Tafel curves are shown in Fig. 5b and ESI Fig. S4b.† The NiCo-ZIF@MIL (1:2) electrode achieves a low Tafel slope of 122 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>, which is much lower than that of bare NiCo-ZIF ( $\sim$ 200 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>) and bare MIL-100 ( $\sim$ 250 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>), and even lower than that of commercial RuO<sub>2</sub> (130 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>), further suggesting that NiCo-ZIF@MIL (1:2) could display higher OER catalytic kinetics. The results of EIS (Fig. 5c and ESI Fig. S4c†) show the smallest charge-transfer resistance ( $R_{ct}$ ) of the NiCo-ZIF@MIL (1:2), indicating a swift charge movement at electrode/electrolyte interfaces. This swift charge transfer implies that NiCo-ZIF@MIL (1:2) could accomplish a faster charge transfer rate, which is also in line with the above results of LSV curves and Tafel plots. The fast charge movement enhances the intrinsic activity and facilitates the improvement of its electrocatalytic performance, conforming to the synergy between NiCo-ZIF and MIL-100.47 The  $C_{\rm dl}$  value of the electrochemical active surface area is further investigated by calculation in accordance with the measured capacitance of the double layer (ESI Fig. S5†).

As shown in Fig. 5d and ESI Fig. S4d,† NiCo-ZIF@MIL (1:2) exhibits a larger specific capacitance ( $C_{\rm dl}$ ) value of 5.32 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>, which is significantly superior to that of NiCo-ZIF (2.82 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>), MIL-100 (0.14 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>), NiCo-ZIF@MIL (2:1) (2.87 mF  $cm^{-2}$ ), NiCo-ZIF@MIL (1:1)  $(3.56 mF cm^{-2})$ , and NiCo-ZIF@MIL (1:3) (2.60 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>). The enhanced  $C_{dl}$  may be due to the additional exposure of active sites on the interface of the dual MOF structure. 48 The activity and stability of NiCo-ZIF@MIL (1: 2) is examined by 1000 CV scanning cycles and I-T curve (Fig. 5e and f). After 1000 cycles, the overpotential of  $\eta_{10}$  is almost unchanged. The catalytic activity could be maintained for at least 24 h, further indicating the outstanding catalytic activity of the NiCo-ZIF@MIL (1:2) catalyst. In addition, we explored the dissolution behaviour of the catalysts during the alkaline OER process and used ICP-OES to quantify the elemental dissolution in the KOH electrolyte (Table S2†). The measured results showed that the dissolved amounts of Fe, Co, and Ni in the alkaline electrolyte after 24 h stability test were 0.059, 0.019 and 0.006 mg L<sup>-1</sup>, respectively, which demonstrated the excellent stability of the NiCo-ZIF@MIL(1:2) catalyst.49

In order to further investigate the superior stability and excellent catalytic activity of the NiCo-ZIF@MIL (1:2), XRD,

Scheme 2 Proposed reaction mechanisms for the OER

XPS, ICP, HRTEM and Raman were employed after the OER (Fig. S6, Table S2†). The results of XRD, ICP and HRTEM suggest the stability of the structure and morphology. In addition, the XPS and Raman results after the OER indicate that there is a strong synergistic interaction between Co and Fe during the OER process, which promotes the formation of Co–O–Fe bridge bonds and accelerates the adsorption of OH<sup>-</sup>, thus lowering the energy barrier. Notably, we could clearly observe plenty of bubbles produced from the electrode (inset in Fig. 5f).

#### Theoretical calculations

To obtain insight into the mechanism of improved OER properties, DFT calculations were introduced to study the reaction pathways of NiCo-ZIF, MIL-100, and NiCo-ZIF@MIL. In an alkaline solution, the OER steps are proposed as follows, 50 where \* represents the active site of the catalyst, and OOH\*, O\*, and OH\* represent the intermediates (Scheme 2).

The geometric configurations of NiCo-ZIF@MIL, NiCo-ZIF, and MIL-100 are shown in Fig. 6a, and S7 and S8 in the ESI.† Previous studies have shown that intrinsic activity is estimated from the maximum standard Gibbs free energy differences in the rate-determining step (RDS) of the OER. $^{51}$  In Fig. 6b, Gibbs energy diagrams at zero potential are given. The four reaction steps for MIL-100 have values of +1.37, +0.37, +3.11, and +0.07 eV, respectively. The calculations show that the RDS of MIL-100 is the formation of OOH\* through the reaction of adsorbed O atoms and  $H_2O$  molecules (step 3), with an energy requirement of 3.11 eV, which indicates that the bond strength between OOH\* and the surface of MIL-100 is weak. The values for the four reaction steps of NiCo-ZIF are +0.08, +1.07, +1.1, and +2.67 eV. The RDS of NiCo-ZIF is the process of generating  $O_2$

molecules (step 4) with a Gibbs energy change of 2.67 eV. The RDS of NiCo-ZIF@MIL is the formation of OOH\* through the reaction of adsorbed O atoms and H<sub>2</sub>O molecules (step 3), requiring an energy of only 2.08 eV. The OER reaction begins with the adsorption of OH\*, which starts the OER reaction at the Co-Fe bimetallic bridge site. Afterwards, the adsorbed OH\* is deprotonated to O\*, and then OOH\* is formed at the Co-Fe bimetallic bridge site. Finally, OOH\* is deprotonated to form O2, and the reaction can be repeated.52 Based on the RDS analysis, NiCo-ZIF@MIL exhibits optimal theoretical OER properties, thus the most favorable OER mechanism is proposed (Fig. 6c). The above theoretical calculation results suggest that the strong synergistic effects, derived from the heterostructure NiCo-ZIF@MIL, could decrease the activation energy barrier for the OER by rearranging the charge around Fe and Co, which improves the adsorption of OH<sup>-</sup> on the Co-O-Fe bridge structure, thus leading to the improved OER performance in comparison to the bare NiCo-ZIF and MIL.53 We deduced that the charge transfer through the Co-O-Fe bridge structure moderates the adsorption of OH\* intermediates and reduces the energy barrier of the OER process.

To further explore the reasons for the excellent activity of NiCo-ZIF@MIL, we performed Bader charge analysis (Table 1). The Bader charge at the Co site in NiCo-ZIF and at the Fe site in MIL-100 are 1.140 and 1.481, respectively. In NiCo-ZIF@MIL, the Co site gains electrons, the Bader charge is 1.015, and the gained charge is 0.125|e|; the Fe site loses electrons, the Bader charge becomes 1.626, and the lost charge is 0.145|e|. Therefore, we infer that electrons can be transferred from Fe to Co,54 in agreement with the results of XPS analysis. Combined with XPS analysis, it can be further proved that the electrons could be transferred from Fe to Co to realize the regulation of the electronic structure. This increased electron state density around NiCo-ZIF is beneficial for the process of deprotonation. Furthermore, according to the Sabatier principle, the moderate redistribution of electrons is beneficial to optimizing the bond energy of active sites and oxygen-containing intermediates,55 thus improving the catalytic OER properties.

#### Conclusions

In summary, we have designed and synthesized a highly active and robust NiCo-ZIF@MIL catalyst through constructing diatomic Fe-Co sites and amorphization for enhanced alkaline

OER properties. In particular, NiCo-ZIF@MIL (1:2) presented prominent activity for OER electrocatalysis, which was much superior to that of RuO2. The excellent OER activity of NiCo-ZIF@MIL (1:2) could be due to the following perspectives: (1) the hydroxyl group of H<sub>4</sub>DOBDC could construct a large number of defects and modify the active sites more to promote the adsorption of OH of the solution and oxygen-containing intermediates, which improves the OER activity; (2) the amorphous structure might afford numerous localized defects, expose a large number of active sites and thus improve the catalytic performance. (3) DFT calculations reveal the spontaneous adsorption of OH<sup>-</sup> to Fe and Co sites to form a strong Co-O-Fe bridge structure, suggesting that the charge rearrangement in the NiCo-ZIF@MIL plays a crucial role in the adsorption of reaction media. The findings in this work are expected to give a better understanding of the mild synthesis of highly active electrocatalysts and the enhancement of their electrocatalytic properties through the formation of a Co-O-Fe bridging bond.

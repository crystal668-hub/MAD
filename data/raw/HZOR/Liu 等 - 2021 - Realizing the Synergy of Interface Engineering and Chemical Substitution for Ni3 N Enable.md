*Yi Liu, Jihua Zhang, Yapeng Li, Qizhu Qian, Ziyun Li, and Genqiang Zhang\**

**Hydrazine oxidation assisted water electrolysis offers a unique rationale for energy-saving hydrogen production, yet the lack of effective non-noble-metal bifunctional catalysts is still a grand challenge at the current stage. Here, the Mo doped Ni3N and Ni heterostructure porous nanosheets grow on Ni foam (denoted as MoNi3N/Ni/NF) are successfully constructed, featuring simultaneous interface engineering and chemical substitution, which endow the outstanding bifunctional electrocatalytic performances toward both hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), demanding a working potential of −0.3 mV to reach 10 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> for HzOR and −45 mV for that of HER. Impressively, the overall hydrazine splitting (OHzS) system requires an ultralow cell voltage of 55 mV to deliver 10 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> with remarkable long-term durability. Moreover, as a proof-of-concept, economical H2 production systems utilizing OHzS unit powered by a waste AAA battery, a commercial solar cell, and a homemade direct hydrazine fuel cell (DHzFC) are investigated to inspire future practical applications. The density functional theory calculations demonstrate that the synergy of Mo substitution and abundant Ni3N/Ni interface owns a more thermoneutral value for H\* absorption ability toward HER and optimized dehydrogenation process for HzOR.**

fuels in the near future.[2] Challengingly, currently dominant hydrogen production strategy relies on steam reforming involving fossil energy sources including natural gas, oil, and coal,[3] which is accompanied by severe carbon emission and tremendous energy consumption. In this context, electrochemical water splitting has recently attracted tremendous attention as a promising alternative, owing to its unique advantages of zerocarbon emission, high hydrogen purity, and feasible integration with renewable energy utilization techniques.[3,4] However, this process contains two half-reactions, that is, cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), among which the sluggish kinetics of OER become the bottleneck issue responsible for the required high cell voltages, mainly due to the associated multi-proton-coupled-electron-transfer steps.[5] Therefore, developing advanced techniques that allow to concur the ther-

modynamic limitation of water splitting, has been desired and triggered flourishing research focus.

In recent years, electrochemical oxidation of some thermodynamically favorable molecules or economically attractive reactants has been proposed to replace sluggish OER in water splitting, such as urea,[6] methanol,[7] ethanol,[8] tetrahydroisoquinolines,[9] primary amines,[10] nitrogen,[11] and hydrazine,[12] which holds great potential to achieve much lower cell voltage for hydrogen production or produce value-added products. Among these, hydrazine oxidation has attracted extraordinary attention due to the significantly lower theoretical oxidation potential (HzOR, N2H4 + 4OH<sup>−</sup> → N2 + 4H2O + 4e−, −0.33 V vs RHE)[13] and the advantage of well adaptiveness to separatorfree electrolyzer as N2 is the only byproduct.[14] Hence, utilizing HzOR to replace OER could potentially embrace bright prospect of energy-saving H2 production, where inspiring progress has been made in some pioneering works. For examples, Fe–CoS2 nanosheets developed by Ding et al. exhibited robust HER and HzOR performance, where only 129 mV was needed to reach 100 mA cm–2 for HzOR and −40 mV to deliver 10 mA cm–2 for HER;[15] Xia group reported an ordered Co3Ta intermetallic compound, which exhibited praiseworthy HzOR performance with

a current density of 25.2 mA cm–2 at merely 0.06 V.[16] Despite those exciting achievements, several unprecedented challenges still remain to be addressed. First, it is still necessary to explore advanced electrocatalysts in order to further push forward the electrochemical catalytic activity toward HzOR, especially for delivering violent hydrogen evolution at low potential considering the thermodynamic potential. Then, high-performance bifunctional materials toward both HzOR and HER are highly attractive since it would simplify the catalytic electrode design/ construction and reduce the cost, while it is quite difficult to achieve favorable material system due to the involved distinct active species. In addition, theoretical understandings on the underlying catalytic mechanisms of HzOR catalytic process for the new materials would undoubtedly contribute to unravel the active sites and thus further promote the development of designing advanced catalysts.

As known, constructing heterojunction interface could be a powerful strategy to design efficient electrocatalysts thanks to the mutual promoted action of two components, which can boost the electron transfer, modulate the adsorption/desorption behavior, and finally improve the catalytic performance.[17] For instance, Fan et al. reported Co–Ni3N heterostructure array, whose enhanced HER capacity may be attributed to the interface transfer effect.[18] The Cu1Ni2-N system reported by Mai et al. exhibited bifunctional activity with an overpotential of 71.4 mV at 10 mA cm–2 for HER in 1.0 m KOH and a working potential of 0.5 mV for HzOR in 1.0 m KOH/0.5 m N2H4, which may stem from the rich Cu4N/Ni3N interface.[12] On the other hand, heteroatom substitution has been demonstrated as an alternative promising strategy to achieve impressive bifunctional activity toward HzOR and HER, such as the aforementioned Fe doped CoS2 nanosheets and P, W co-doped Co3N nanowires.[19] These encouraging progresses have stimulated continuous pursuit to construct an advanced nanostructured system that integrates both heterostructure interfaces and heteroatom substitution, aiming to build the top notch bifunctional catalysts for hydrazine electrooxidation assisted energy saving hydrogen generation, which is meaningful while has rarely been reported.

Herein, we realize the synergy of interface engineering and chemical substitution by constructing Mo doped Ni3N and Ni heterostructure porous nanosheets grown on Ni foam (denoted as Mo–Ni3N/Ni/NF) that can act as superior bifunctional electrocatalysts toward both HzOR and HER in alkaline condition. Specifically, for HzOR, the required working potentials to obtain the current density of 10, 200, and 600 mA cm–2 are mere −0.3, 75, and 148 mV (vs RHE) in 1.0 m KOH/0.1 m N2H4, respectively, which is comparable to best results of recent literatures;[1c,16,19,20] for HER, Mo-Ni3N/Ni/NF only needs a low overpotential (*η*) of 45 mV to reach 10 mA cm–2 in 1.0 m KOH. Impressively, the two-electrode overall hydrazine splitting (OHzS) system using Mo-Ni3N/Ni/NF as both anode and cathode can achieve an ultralow cell voltage of 55 mV at 10 mA cm–2, and more importantly, can reach a high current density of 300 mA cm−<sup>2</sup> with a cell voltage of 0.423 V in 1.0 m KOH/0.1 m N2H4. Furthermore, we explored the economical H2 production systems as extended applications to exploit the ultralow cell voltage advantage of OHzS via using a waste AAA battery, a commercial solar cell, and a home-made direct hydra-

zine fuel cell (DHzFC) as power source to drive OHzS unit, where decent H2 evolution rates can be obtained. Importantly, density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the synergy of Mo substitution and abundant Ni3N/Ni interface can not only effectively modulate H\* adsorption/desorption behavior but also simultaneously decrease the energy barrier of ratedetermining dehydrogenation step during HzOR. This work demonstrates a unique strategy to develop a high-performance yet low-cost bifunctional electrocatalyst, which could shed light on energy-saving hydrogen production beyond direct electrochemical water splitting.

### **2. Results and Discussion**

The formation process of Mo–Ni3N/Ni/NF can be illustrated in **Scheme 1**, which is through a facile hydrothermal reaction using nickel nitrate hexahydrate, ammonium fluoride, and urea as reagents, and sodium molybdate dihydrate as the dopant source, followed by the vapor phase nitridation process. Specifically, during the hydrothermal process, the added urea will first hydrolyze as a function of precipitator to provide an alkaline environment,[21] which then allows the nucleation and crystal growth of the metal hydroxide precursor nanosheets array.[22] Afterward, in light of the reactivity with NH3 [23] and the poor thermal stability of Ni3N,[24] there will be partial metallic Ni phase formed upon high temperature nitridization process to form the final product of Mo–Ni3N/Ni-NF (see details in the Experimental Section and in Supporting Information). The morphological and structural information of as-prepared materials were examined by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). **Figure 1**A,B presents the FESEM images of Mo–Ni3N/Ni/NF, which clearly show that nanosheets are densely and uniformly growing on Ni foam, with a lateral size of ≈600 nm and a thickness of ≈20 nm. The enlarged view (Figure 1C) and the TEM image (Figure 1D) provided the direct evidence that the nanosheets possess porous networklike structure assembled by numerous interconnected coarse nanoparticles with an average diameter of about 20 nm, which may be inherited from phase transformation during annealing process yet different from the relatively smooth surface of precursor (Figure S1, Supporting Information) and undoped

Ni3N/Ni/NF (Figure S2, Supporting Information). The porous structure may be able to offer more exposed active sites and is beneficial for mass and charge transfer.[25] The XRD patterns of the as-prepared Mo–Ni3N/Ni/NF and Ni3N/Ni/NF can both be well indexed to the mixed phases of cubic Ni (JCPDS card no.70-1849) and hexagonal Ni3N (JCPDS card no.89-5144) (Figure S3, Supporting Information). Moreover, several detected circles of bright dots from the selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of Mo–Ni3N/Ni/NF can be assigned to crystal planes of both Ni3N and Ni (Figure S4, Supporting Information), further identifying the co-existence of Ni3N and Ni phases. In the HRTEM image of Mo–Ni3N/Ni/NF (Figure 1E), randomly distributed phases of Ni and Ni3N can be observed, which leads to abundant interfaces. Figure 1F,H presents the enlarged views of Figure 1E, where the (111) and (002) planes of Ni3N and the (200) plane of Ni can be detected. Notably, a representative interface between Ni and Ni3N within a single particle (Figure 1H) suggests the ubiquitous interfacial contact between Ni and Ni3N. In addition, the HAADF-STEM image and corresponding elemental mapping results (Figure 1I) reveal that the Mo, Ni, and N elements are homogeneously distributed. It should be noted that the mixed phases of Ni and Ni3N could only be observed at the annealing temperature of 420 °C (Figure S5, Supporting Information), while lower temperature (350 °C) leads to the formation of pure Ni3N and higher temperature (500 °C) may cause the decomposing of Ni3N accompanying the increase of Ni phase, attributing to the low thermal stability of Ni3N as we mentioned above.[24] The water contact angle measurement of Mo–Ni3N/Ni/NF was further applied to assess the ability of electrolyte penetration (Figure S6 and Movie S1, Supporting Information), where a superhydrophilic nature with a very small contact angle of nearly 0° can be observed, guaranteeing the sufficient contact between the active species and electrolyte. Different doping levels can be obtained via different dopant ratios with similar morphology (Figure S7, Supporting Information).

The X-ray photoelectron spectrum (XPS) was then performed to verify the surface chemical states of as-prepared materials. The survey spectrum (Figure S8, Supporting Information) confirms the co-existence of Mo, Ni, and N elements in Mo–Ni3N/ Ni/NF with no detectable Mo signal in Ni3N/Ni/NF. As shown in **Figure 2**A, six peaks can be deconvoluted for Ni 2p spectra of Mo–Ni3N/Ni/NF at 852.7, 855.8, 861.3, 870.0, 873.9, and 880.1 eV, respectively. The peaks at 852.7 and 870.0 eV for Ni 2p3/2 and Ni 2p1/2 can be assigned to metallic nickel or nickel nitrides, respectively,[26] since the binding energy of Ni in Ni3N is close to metallic nickel and hard to be distinguished.[26a,b,27] The peaks at 855.8 and 873.9 eV can be assigned to Ni2+ with the corresponding satellite peaks at 861.3 and 880.1 eV, which are possibly derived from the surface oxidation.[28] Moreover,

the binding energy of Ni in Mo–Ni3N/Ni/NF shifts toward higher with a value ≈0.1 eV compared to that in Ni3N/Ni/NF, implying the electron transfer between Mo and Ni. Figure 2B exhibits N 1s spectrum of Mo–Ni3N/Ni/NF, where the main peak at 397.2 eV can be assigned to metal-N bond while those at 399.0 and 394.7 eV correspond to the NH groups and Mo 3p species, respectively.[26a,29] Compared with Ni3N/Ni/NF, the binding energy of metal-N in Mo-Ni3N/Ni/NF shifts toward lower energy with ≈0.5 eV. The fitting curve of the Mo 3d spectrum shown in Figure 2C could be deconvoluted to three oxidation states, that is, +3, +4, and +6. The absence of Mo0 (usually at ≈228 eV)[30] and the existence of MoN bond (Mo3+, 228.8 and 231.8 eV)[31] verified that Mo atoms are indeed doped into Ni3N. The high oxidation state for Mo (+4 and +6) is likely attributed to the surface oxidation.[32] To further exclude the possible impact of the high oxidation states from the adsorbed surface oxygen, the XPS spectra of MoNi3N/Ni/NF after Ar ion etching was conducted, where the Ni 2p spectrum is shown in Figure 2D, revealing that the peaks assigned to metallic Ni and Ni3N become dominant and the Ni<sup>2</sup>+ signals vanished. Given that metallic Ni species are not able to produce shakeup satellites,[33] the existence of satellite peaks also imply the entity of Ni3N.[34] Similarly, in the N 1s spectrum (Figure 2E), the peaks attributed to metal-N bond and Mo 3p signals also indicate the formation of metal nitride and the presence of Mo dopants. Figure 2F shows the Mo 3d spectrum after Ar<sup>+</sup> etching, where the Mo<sup>3</sup>+ signal and the deficiency of Mo0 further suggest that Mo element may be doped into Ni3N phase.

In order to evaluate the synergistic effect of heterostructure interface and chemical substitution, the hydrazine oxidation performance of MoNi3N/Ni/NF in alkaline media was subsequently investigated using a typical three-electrode system (graphite rod as counter electrode and Hg/HgO as reference electrode). It should be noted that the pKa of hydrazine is 8.10,[35] so that the pH value change of 1.0 m KOH with the addition of N2H4 is negligible[1c] (Figure S9, Supporting Information). The set of electrodes with varied Mo ratios and different annealing temperatures were tested toward HzOR (Figures S10–S12, Supporting Information), and the catalyst named Mo-Ni3N/Ni/NF refers to the sample with a dopant concentration of 0.05 mmol and annealed at 420 °C that possesses the best HzOR activity unless specified. Figure S13, Supporting Information presents that no detectable anodic current in the experimental potential window can be observed in the absence of hydrazine addition. Notably, the presence of 0.05 m N2H4 addition will cause a sharp rise of anodic current, which keeps increasing with the increase of hydrazine concentration from 0.05 to 0.15 m. **Figure 3**A compares the LSV curves of several control samples for HzOR in 1.0 m KOH/0.1 m N2H4 electrolyte, where Mo–Ni3N/Ni/NF exhibits the best performance toward HzOR with a working potential of −0.3 mV to reach 10 mA cm–2, and also comparable among the recently reported values (Table S1, Supporting Information). Even for the high current density of 200 mA cm–2, only an ultrasmall working potential of 75 mV is needed, superior to Ni3N/Ni/NF (146 mV), demonstrating the positive effect of heteroatom substitution on the

HzOR catalysis. Besides, as shown in Figure 3B, MoNi3N/Ni/ NF displays a smaller Tafel slope value (48 mV dec–1) compared with Ni3N/Ni/NF (92 mV dec–1), NNi foam (127 mV dec–1), Ni foam (198 mV dec–1), and MoNi3N/Ni precursor (366 mV dec–1), revealing the most favorable catalytic kinetics for HzOR. These results are also in accordance with the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) tests, where MoNi3N/Ni/NF electrode shows the smallest charge transfer resistance (*R*ct) of 2.9 Ω cm<sup>2</sup> (Figure S14, Supporting Information). Moreover, when the scan rate was increased from 10 to 100 mV s–1, the LSV curves of MoNi3N/Ni/NF show little changes, as evidenced in Figure S15, Supporting Information, suggesting efficient mass and charge transport in catalytic process.[36] The stability of MoNi3N/ Ni/NF is assessed by a repeated CV scanning test (5K cycles), as shown in Figure 3C, where only slight changes in current density can be observed. Simultaneously, the corresponding Tafel slope value slightly increases from 48 to 54 mV dec–1, in accordance with EIS results (Figure S16, Supporting Information). In addition, the XRD pattern of MoNi3N/Ni/NF after HzOR reaction (Figure S17A, Supporting Information) shows identical peaks indexing to cubic Ni (JCPDS card no.70-1849) and hexagonal Ni3N phase (JCPDS card no. 89–5144) without impurities, demonstrating the robust stability of electrode. Moreover, the XPS spectra of MoNi3N/Ni/NF after HzOR stability test (Figure S17B,C, Supporting Information) also suggeststhe existence of obvious metallic Ni, NiN, and MoN bond, further supporting the promising durability toward HzOR. We also conducted *i–t* test for MoNi3N/Ni/NF at an initial current density of ≈40 mA cm–2 (Figure 3G), and the electrolyte was changed every 22 h to exclude the effect of decreased hydrazine concentration during reaction. The electrode shows outstanding catalytic stability after electrolysis for 110 h, suggesting the robustness toward HzOR catalysis.

Besides the impressive HzOR catalytic ability, our Mo–Ni3N/Ni/NF also exhibits promising performance for hydrogen evolution catalysis in alkaline media. Similarly, we first screened samples with varied Mo ratios and annealing temperatures (Figures S18 and S19, Supporting Information) and it was found that the sample possessing the best HER activity was the same one with that of HzOR. Figure 3D

shows the comparing LSV curves of different samples toward HER, where MoNi3N/Ni/NF only needs an overpotential (*η*) of mere 45 mV, superior to Ni3N/Ni/NF (122 mV), NNi foam (193 mV), Ni foam (210 mV), and MoNi3N/Ni precursor (173 mV), and also outstanding compared with recently reported transition metal nitrides (Table S2, Supporting Infor mation).[12,29b,32a,37] The smallest Tafel slope for MoNi3N/Ni/ NF (45 mV dec–1) shown in Figure S20, Supporting Information and the minimal *R*ct (2.3 Ω cm2 , Figure S21, Supporting Information) further suggest the most profitable kinetics for MoNi3N/Ni/NF toward HER. The top-notch HER activity of MoNi3N/Ni/NF can be intuitively demonstrated by the Bubble + Color Mapped graph (Figure 3E) comparing different materials, where the biggest bubble exhibits the best performance considering both *η*@10 mA cm–2 and Tafel slope value. The double layer capacitance (*C*dl) values, which are proportional to the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA)[38] calculated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurement shown in Figure S22, Supporting Information, are presented in Figure S23, Supporting Information. The *C*dl value of MoNi3N/Ni/NF is 2.26 times that of Ni3N/Ni/NF (4.3 mF cm–2) and much greater than NNi foam, Ni foam, and MoNi3N/Ni-precursor, demonstrating the exposure of more accessible active sites. Moreover, the TOF value of ≈0.06 s–1 (Figures S24 and S25, Supporting Information) can be achieved in MoNi3N/Ni/NF at an overpotential of 50 mV, superior to that of Ni3N/Ni/NF (≈0.02 s–1), suggesting the improved intrinsic activity. Interestingly, the HER activity of MoNi3N/Ni/NF is very stable under repeated 5K-cycle CV scanning test (Figure 3F) with mild changes. Specifically, the overpotential at 10 mA cm–2 exhibited only 4 mV decay (the inset of Figure 3F) and the corresponding Tafel slope value was changed to 47 mV dec–1 with a mere 4.44% increasing rate besides the mild change in the EIS semi-circle (Figure S26, Supporting Information). The chronoamperometry process running continuously for 110 h (Figure 3G) delivers an excellent current density retention rate of 90%, suggesting great stability of MoNi3N/Ni/NF.

To guarantee the ability of the hydrogen generation of MoNi3N/Ni/NF in alkaline electrolyte with hydrazine, we compare the LSV curves of MoNi3N/Ni/NF for HER/HzOR and HER/OER couples in 1 m KOH with and without 0.1 m hydrazine in a three-electrode system (**Figure 4**A; Figure S27, Supporting Information). It is clear that the HER process has not changed much and the anodic current can be extremely high even in a low potential under alkaline electrolyte with 0.1 m hydrazine, further confirming the feasibility of next hydrogen production with MoNi3N/Ni/NF as bifunctional electrocatalyst for catalyzing H2 generation via OHzS. The OHzS system, as schematically shown in Figure 4B, utilizes MoNi3N/Ni/ NF as both the anode and the cathode in 1 m KOH with 0.1 m hydrazine under ambient temperature. Figure 4C shows the LSV curves of OHzS and overall water splitting (OWS), revealing the outstanding thermodynamic and kinetic advantages of OHzS. Specifically, OHzS only needs cell voltages of 0.055, 0.187, 0.265, and 0.423 V to achieve current densities of 10, 50, 100, and 300 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> , respectively, yet relatively higher cell voltages of 1.54, 1.90, 2.10, and 2.74 V are needed for OWS (Figure S28, Supporting Information). As observed in Figure 4D, for OHzS, the chronoamperimetric curve delivers 50 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> in the beginning and remains stable for 10 h with no observable

current density decay at the cell voltage of 0.19 V, exhibiting the prominent durability. Besides, the experimental hydrogen production amount generated by cathodic electrode displays a good agreement with theoretically calculated value, suggesting a near 100% Faraday efficiency (Figure S29, Supporting Information). The Faraday efficiency of nitrogen production was also studied (Figure S30, Supporting Information); unsurprisingly, the value of experimental nitrogen production well matches the theoretical calculation.

The outstanding thermodynamic and kinetic advantages of OHzS unit based on Mo-Ni<sub>3</sub>N/Ni/NF inspire us to further explore the practicability of economical H2 production for future applications. First, a single waste AAA battery with the open circuit voltage of 1.182 V (taken from the remoter of air-conditioner) is utilized as power supply for the OHzS unit using Mo-Ni<sub>3</sub>N/Ni/NF as both anode and cathode (**Figure 5**A), where vigorous H<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub> gas bubbles can be observed (Movie S2, Supporting Information) and a decent H2 production rate of 0.73 mmol h<sup>-1</sup> can be achieved (Figure S31, Supporting Information), which upgrades disregardful power into high-value H<sub>2</sub> fuel and meets the requirement of carbon-neutral economy. Besides, the low cell voltage of the OHzS unit makes it suitable for H<sub>2</sub> production powered by a commercial solar cell with an output voltage of ≈0.588 V (Figure 5B; Figure S32 and Movie S3, Supporting Information). Upon measurement, an outstanding H<sub>2</sub> production rate of 1.04 mmol h<sup>-1</sup> can be achieved through this solar cell driven OHzS system (Figure 5C), which extends the future practical applications. Moreover, we built an integrated H<sub>2</sub> production system by driving the OHzS with a home-made direct hydrazine fuel cell (DHzFC) as power supply (Figure 5D). The DHzFC was set up by coupling Mo-Ni<sub>3</sub>N/Ni/NF anode and commercial Pt/C cathode, by which N2H4 was oxidized to N<sub>2</sub> through HzOR and O<sub>2</sub> was reduced to H<sub>2</sub>O.<sup>[39]</sup> Specifically, our home-made DHzFC possesses an open-circuit voltage of 0.96 V (Figure S33, Supporting Information), and can deliver a maximum power density of 37.8 mW cm<sup>-2</sup> at a current density of 98.0 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> in 1.0 M KOH/0.5 M  $N_2H_4$  electrolyte at room temperature (Figure 5E), which is outstanding comparable to recently reported results under similar working conditions. [39b,40] Vigorous gas bubbles (Figure S34 and Movie S4, Supporting Information) can be observed and a promising H2 production rate of 0.76 mmol h<sup>-1</sup> can be achieved (Figure 5F).

The DFT calculations were then performed for both HER and HzOR process in order to reveal the synergy effect on catalytic activity by interface engineering and chemical substitution. A few layers of Mo doped is used to model the Mo doped Ni<sub>3</sub>N and Ni heterostructure, while the model system with the lowest energy surface of Ni<sub>3</sub>N (001) and Ni<sub>3</sub>N (001) slab located on the Ni (111) surface is considered for a comparison, as shown in Figure 6A. For HER process, many previous works have confirmed that the free energy of adsorbed H ( $\Delta G_{H^*}$ ) is the key descriptor for HER and the ideal result should be close to zero.[4d,41] Ten different sites were first considered to infer the most possible hydrogen adsorption site for Mo-Ni<sub>3</sub>N/Ni (Figure S35, Supporting Information). The results indicate that the site with the smallest distance between H and the nearest neighboring N of Mo atom possesses the most suitable  $\Delta G_{H^*}$ value (close to zero), which tends to be the most suitable site for hydrogen adsorption. Comparing with the Ni<sub>3</sub>N (-0.56 eV) as illustrated in Figure 6B, after constructing Ni<sub>3</sub>N/Ni interface, the  $\Delta G_{H^*}$  value becomes -0.4 eV slightly favorable compared to Ni<sub>3</sub>N, yet the strong H adsorption could result in poor HER performance. Importantly, after the introduction of Mo atoms into Ni<sub>3</sub>N/Ni, it exhibits optimal hydrogen evolution kinetics with a much closer thermoneutral value of 0.06 eV, which is responsible for the superior HER activity, and demonstrates that the synergy of Mo doping and interface engineering can jointly improve the intrinsic activity for HER. The density of states (DOS) for Ni<sub>3</sub>N, Ni<sub>3</sub>N/Ni, and Mo-Ni<sub>3</sub>N/Ni were further calculated as presented in Figure 6C. After forming hybrid structure, the DOS of Mo-Ni<sub>3</sub>N/Ni at the Fermi level is distinctly increased, which implies that more charge carriers are involved in the catalytic reaction, thus may significantly boost the catalytic performance.<sup>[42]</sup> In addition, the increased DOS at the Fermi level in the hybrid structure also reveals better electrical conductivity with improved charge-transfer kinetic. Moreover, the d-band center analysis indicates that the d-band center of Mo-Ni<sub>3</sub>N/Ni (-1.38 eV) is lower than that of Ni<sub>3</sub>N/Ni (-1.34 eV) and pure Ni<sub>3</sub>N (-1.11 eV), which implies poorer hydrogen adsorption and better hydrogen desorption ability, corresponding to the more optimal  $\Delta G_{H^*}$  value. The charge density difference analysis (Figure 6D) shows that the impact of Mo dopant on Ni atoms could also be revealed, where clear charge depletion (cyan color) in Ni atoms in both Ni layer and Ni<sub>3</sub>N layer could be observed. Moreover, the charge redistribution is dominantly restricted on the heterostructure interface and the charge transferred from the Ni<sub>3</sub>N to the Ni layer, which may potentially enhance the catalytic activity of Mo-Ni<sub>3</sub>N/Ni compared to Ni<sub>3</sub>N.<sup>[43]</sup>

The DFT calculation of HzOR processes for Mo-Ni<sub>3</sub>N/ Ni, Ni<sub>3</sub>N/Ni, and Ni<sub>3</sub>N were further conducted, which may be more valuable to decipher the possible origins of high catalytic activity, especially in this early stage. Figure 6F illustrates the Gibbs free energy profiles for the stepwise dehydrogenation process from N2H4 to N2 with solvent interactions on Mo-Ni<sub>3</sub>N/Ni, Ni<sub>3</sub>N/Ni, and Ni<sub>3</sub>N, respectively, and the detailed values of each step are summarized (Table S3, Supporting Information). Interestingly, the absorption of N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> is both thermodynamically favorable on the surface of Mo-Ni<sub>3</sub>N/Ni (-0.71 eV), Ni<sub>3</sub>N/Ni (-0.78 eV), and Ni<sub>3</sub>N (-0.74 eV). Notably, dehydrogenation of \*NH2NH to \*N2H2 is the rate determining step (RDS) for Ni<sub>3</sub>N surface toward HzOR. Comparing Ni<sub>3</sub>N/Ni and Ni<sub>3</sub>N, constructing interface exhibits negligible change to the dehydrogenation process, and the rate determining steps are both dehydrogenation of \*NH2NH to \*N2H2. However, when we introduce Mo into Ni<sub>3</sub>N/Ni, the dehydrogenation of \*N<sub>2</sub> to N<sub>2</sub> becomes the rate determining step, and the energy barrier is reduced (+0.6 vs +0.68 eV for Ni<sub>3</sub>N), demonstrating the high impact of Mo dopant on facilitating the thermodynamic behavior of dehydrogenation process.

#### 3. Conclusion

In summary, we have constructed Mo doped  $Ni_3N$  and Ni heterostructure porous nanosheets grown on Ni foam (denoted as Mo $-Ni_3N/Ni/NF$ ) that can act as superior bifunctional electrocatalysts toward both HzOR and HER in alkaline condition,

Specifically, it can reach the current density of 10 mA cm–2 at the working potential of mere −0.3 mV toward HzOR and the overpotential of 45 mV toward HER, respectively. As both the anode and cathode in 1.0 m KOH/0.1 m N2H4, efficient hydrogen production via OHzS can

due to the outstanding HzOR and HER performance, the integrated economical H2 production system was assembled to explore the possible future applications by utilizing a waste

AAA battery, a commercial solar cell, and a home-made DHzFC to power OHzS unit, which can deliver a promising H2 production rate. The DFT calculations unravel that MoNi3N/Ni/NF could own a more thermoneutral *ΔG*H\* value, and negatively shifted d-band center for HER process, as well as reducing the activation energy of the dehydrogenation process for HzOR. This work is expected to provide a new perspective to develop low-cost bifunctional catalysts toward HzOR and HER aiming for energy-saving hydrogen production beyond direct electrochemical water splitting.

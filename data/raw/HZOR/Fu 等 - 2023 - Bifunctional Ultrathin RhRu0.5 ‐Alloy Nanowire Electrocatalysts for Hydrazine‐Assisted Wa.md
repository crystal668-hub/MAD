# **1. Introduction**

Hydrazine-assisted water electrolysis can greatly lower the required voltage and energy consumption for green hydrogen production by replacing the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in conventional water electrolysis with the hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR). Hydrazine is widely employed in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries,[1] and waste water containing hydrazine is carcinogenic and toxic.[2–3] Therefore, hydrazine-assisted water electrolyzers can allow the conversion of hydrazine into molhydrogen and nitrogen, thus offering a potential pathway for hazard removal while at the same time achieving green hydrogen production. Although catalytic hydrazine decomposition has also been studied,[4–5] the hydrazine-assisted water electrolyzer offers the advantage of producing hydrogen

in the cathode compartment without the need for nitrogen separation, and has attracted considerable recent interests.[6]

Since the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is essentially the same as that of the common water electrolysis, the anodic HzOR represents the key reaction for hydrazine-assisted water splitting. In particular, a complete electrooxidation is essential, not only for the efficient utilization of hydrazine, but also for preventing the potential generation of harmful byproducts (e.g., NH3) rather than the environmentally friendly N2. Although many electrocatalysts based on less costly metals (e.g., Ni,[7] Co,[8–9] Ru,[10–11] etc.) have been explored for HzOR to date, they are generally unable to achieve the total electrooxidation of hydrazine[12] and produce NH3 as an undesired byproduct[13] from differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS) and rotation disk electrode (RDE) study,[12] which is consistent with the theoretical study that suggests some non-noble metals (e.g., Ni) could facilitate both N–H cleavage and N–N cleavage and lead to incomplete hydrazine oxidation.[14]

On the other hand, noble metals (e.g., Rh, Pt, and Pd) have been shown capable of facilitating the complete oxidation of hydrazine with a charge transfer number of four.[12] Among them, Rh exhibits the lowest half wave potential for HzOR,[12] and therefore represents a primary choice of electrocatalyst. Considering the scarcity and high cost of the noble metal based electrocatalysts, it is essential to develop highly effective electrocatalysts

with high mass activity (MA) to lower the required mass loading. Ru typically exhibits lower onset and half wave potential for HzOR but cannot achieve the total electrooxidation based on the previous RDE studies.[14] Thus, alloying Ru with Rh based electrocatalysts may bring synergistic benefits to lower the overpotential while simultaneously achieve complete oxidation of hydrazine.[12] RhRu-based alloy has also been explored as electrocatalysts for the HER,[15–16] OER[17–18] and nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR).[19] Nonetheless, its potential application for HzOR has not been explored to .

The HER on the cathode side is also important for the electrolysis and RhRu alloy has also been visited as a good HERelectrocatalyst,[15–16] with the proposed mechanism that Ru site favors the dissociative adsorption of -OH to facilitate the – H adsorption on Rh sites, while at the same time weakens the binding with Had to boost HER performance.

The electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) is also an essential factor in determining the MA. Ultrathin wavy nanowires have been shown to exhibit high ECSA,[20–21] rich surficial defects and potentially catalytic sites thanks to the wavy surface and good charge transport thr the 1D nanostructure.[20,22–23]

Herein, we report the design and synthesis of ultrathin RhRu0.5-alloy wavy nanowires as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for both HzOR and HER. The introduction of Ru considerably lowers the overpotential of the HzOR and thus greatly enhances the performances with an ultrahigh MA of 60.4 ± 6.2 A mg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> at 0.20 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) from the tests on carbon paper, which nearly doubles that of the Rh wavy nanowires (37.6 ± 2.1 A mg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> at 0.20 V vs RHE) and is over one order of magnitude higher than that of the commercial Pt on graphitized carbon (Pt/GC). RDE tests reveal an electron transfer number of four, proving the total oxidation of hydrazine to environmentally friendly nitrogen gas. In addition, the RhRu0.5-alloy wavy nanowires also exhibit better HER performance than Rh wavy nanowires and commercial Pt/GC electrocatalysts. Together, by using the RhRu0.5-alloy wavy nanowires as both HzOR and HER electrocatalysts, the hydrazine-assisted water electrolyzer delivers a current density of 100 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> at a very low overpotential of 54 mV and a high current density of 853 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> at 0.6 V. Chronopotentiometry (CP) tests also demonstrate robust long-term stability over the 80-hour testing period.

# **2. Results and Discussion**

### **2.1. Characterization**

TEM imaging reveals the ultrafine wavy nanowire morphologies for the resulting RhRu0.5 (average diameter: 2.6 ± 0.5 nm) and Rh nanocatalysts with highly jagged surface (**Figure 1**A,B; Figure S1A, Supporting Information). High-resolution TEM (HRTEM) imaging reveals a lattice spacing of 0.22 nm, which is consistent with the (111) facet (Figure 1C). In contrast, the monometallic Ru synthesized under this condition exhibits a nanoparticle morphology (Figure S1B, Supporting Information). The ultrathin diameter with highly jagged surface could contribute to increased surface active sites and lead to ultrahigh ECSA, and the 1D morphology can benefit the charge transport to and from the surface active sites, which is essential for efficient electrocatalysis.

The STEM image (Figure 1D) and the corresponding EDX mapping images for Rh and Ru (Figure 1E,F) demonstrate uniform distribution of Rh and Ru elements in the nanowire structures. A quantification of EDX signal gives an Rh:Ru atomic ratio of 66.5%:33.5% (Figure S2, Supporting Information), which agrees well with the ICP-AES (Ru:Rh = 0.529 ± 0.033:1) results. The XRD study (Figure 1G) demonstrates very similar pattern for the RhRu0.5 wavy nanowires and the Rh wavy nanowires with face centered cubic (FCC) (JCPDS No. 05-0685) crystal structure with peaks corresponding to the characteristic (111), (200), (220), and (311) crystal planes. Meanwhile, the Ru nanoparticle synthesized under the same condition demonstrates hexagonal closepacked (HCP) (JCPDS No. 06-0663) crystal structure, indicating the formation of the alloy phase in RhRu0.5 wavy nanowires promotes the growth of Ru into the FCC lattice. Similar phenomenon has also been reported in the previous literatures regarding RhRu alloys as well.[15] XPS studies reveal the binding energy of Rh in RhRu0.5-alloy wavy nanowires is slightly downshifted by ≈0.05 eV from that of Rh wavy nanowires (Figure 1H); while the binding energy of Ru is upshifted by 0.30 eV from that of monometallic Ru nanoparticles (Figure 1I), indicating the slight charge transfer from Ru to Rh. Such a charge transfer is consistent with the electronegativity difference between Ru (2.20) and Rh (2.28). XPS analysis also reveals a surficial atomic ratio of Rh:Ru is 2.19:1.00, which is similar to the ICP-AES and EDS results. AFM studies confirm a nanowire network morphology (Figure S3A, Supporting Information) with the line profile showing the nanowire thickness of ≈2 nm (Figure S3B, Supporting Information), which is consistent with the TEM studies.

#### **2.2. Electrochemical Study**

The electrochemical performance of the nanowire catalysts was first studied via CV to determine the ECSAHUPD (**Figure 2**A). Significantly, the RhRu0.5 wavy nanowires exhibit an ultrahigh ECSA of 101.3 ± 3.1 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>−</sup>1, thanks to the ultrathin diameter and highly jagged electrochemically accessible surface. Similarly, the Rh wavy nanowires also demonstrate a high ECSA of 101.0 ± 1.3 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>−</sup>1.

The CV studies show that the peaks for hydrogen adsorption and desorption of the RhRu0.5 nanowires shift to lower potential in comparison with Rh nanowires, indicating weakened hydrogen desorption upon the introduction of Ru, which can potentially benefit HER and similar phenomenon has also been reported for the PtRu based nanomaterials.[24]

The preliminary HzOR catalytic activity test was conducted in the electrolyte of 1.0 m KOH and 0.010 m hydrazine. The LSV curve demonstrates a current plateau (Figure 2B), indicating a diffusion limited current ≈7.4 mA for the RhRu0.5-alloy wavy nanowires, which is similar to that of the Rh wavy nanowires. The current plateau shows notable fluctuations, which is attributed to the generation of N2 gas during the reaction. Importantly, the RhRu0.5-alloy wavy nanowires demonstrate improved performances for HzOR with much lower halfwave potential of 19 mV and open circuit potential of −51 mV compared with the Rh wavy nanowires (halfwave potential of 119 mV and open circuit potential of −6 mV).

It is important to evaluate the electron-transfer number to determine complete or incomplete oxidation. To this end, we have conducted RDE studies at different rotation rate. The linear fitting between the diffusion limited current at different rotation rate and the square root of the corresponding rotation rate according to the Levich equation was carried out as shown below:[12]

$$I_{\rm DL} = 0.201 nFA D_{\rm R}^{2/3} v^{-1/6} C \omega^{1/2}$$

The values of the coefficients from the literature:[12] *v* = 1.07 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> cm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>−</sup>1, *F* = 96 500 C mol<sup>−</sup>1, *A* = 0.196 cm2, *D*<sup>R</sup> = 1.40 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>5</sup> cm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>−</sup>1, and *C* = 0.010 mol L<sup>−</sup>1. The linear fitting demonstrates a good linear correlation (*R*<sup>2</sup> *>* 0.99) and yields electron-transfer numbers of 4.02 ± 0.12 for RhRu0.5 wavy nanowires and 4.08 ± 0.08 for Rh wavy nanowires, confirming the complete electrooxidation of hydrazine on Rh-based electrocatalysts.[12] In contrast, the Ru nanoparticles are unable to achieve the complete electrooxidation of hydrazine with a lower electron transfer number of 3.37 ± 0.11, (Figure 2C; Figure S4, Supporting Information), consistent with the previous literature,[12] which negates the advantages of low halfwave potential and open-circuit potential.

We next carried out electrochemical tests on the carbonpaper electrode to explore the practical performance of our catalysts. Carbon-paper electrodes are attractive since the porous nanostructures can greatly facilitate the nitrogen gas removal during the hydrazine electrooxidation process. Importantly, the RhRu0.5-alloy wavy nanowire catalysts on carbonpaper electrode deliver a high MA of 60.4 ± 6.2 A mg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> at 0.20 V vs RHE, which nearly doubles that of Rh nanowires (37.6 ± 2.1 A mg<sup>−</sup>1) and is more than one order of magnitude higher than commercial Pt/GC (5.42 ± 0.24 A mg<sup>−</sup>1). In general, the RhRu0.5-alloy wavy nanowires also demonstrate one order of magnitude higher MA than the previously reported noblemetal-based electrocatalysts, including PtCu/C,[25] Au@Rh core– shell nanowires,[26] NiO*x*-Pt,[27] Ni@Pt/RGO,[28] Pd@Rh[29] electrocatalysts (Figure 2E). In addition, very high geometric current density (60.4 ± 6.2 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> at 0.20 V vs RHE) is also achieved for the RhRu0.5-alloy wavy nanowires at 0.20 V vs RHE, which is also comparable with the results from the literature even with one order of magnitude lower noble metal loading on the electrode,[25–29] which will be highly beneficial for practical device development. In addition, the CA tests were carried out (Figure S5, Supporting Information) and the RhRu0.5-alloy wavy nanowires can also maintain the optimized current density at 0.20 V vs RHE after 1 hour of test.

We have further conducted theoretical studies to explore the role of Ru in facilitating HzOR. Our density functional theory (DFT) calculations of the projected densities of states (PDOS) reveal that the d-band center of the surface Rh atoms in the RhRu0.5 alloy was downshifted from the Fermi level by 0.26 eV in comparison with Rh (**Figure 3**A), which weakens the interaction with adsorbates and facilitates the N2 desorption step of HzOR (Figure 3B), leading to improved activity. In addition, although the N–N bond cleavage is thermodynamically favorable, N–H bond cleavage is more kinetically favorable with the assistance of adsorbed –OH group, with a lower energy barrier of 0.17 eV (and 0.36 eV for –OH migration) than that for N–N bond cleavage (0.59 eV) or that for the non OH-assisted N–H bond cleavage (Figure 3C,D). This underlines the key role of co-adsorbed –OH groups on the reaction selectivity.

The HER performance study was also carried out and the RhRu0.5-alloy nanowires exhibited a MA of 1.89 A mg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> at −0.07 V vs RHE, which outperforms the Rh nanowires (1.11 A mg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> at −0.07 V vs RHE) and the commercial Pt/GC (0.57 A mg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> at −0.07 V vs RHE) (Figure 2F). In addition, a lower Tafel slope was also observed (107.1 mV dec<sup>−</sup>1) for RhRu0.5 alloy nanowires, indicating more favorable kinetics (Figure S6, Supporting Information). CP studies also demonstrate comparably better long-term performance than the Rh nanowires and commercial Pt/GC electrocatalysts during 10 hour of testing (Figure S7, Supporting Information). The improved HER performance in RhRu0.5 alloy can be attributed to the facilitated hydrogen desorption (Figure 2A). Additionally, our DFT studies

indicate that, for the RhRu0.5 alloy, the terrace hollow site (2Ru and 1Rh as shown in Figure S8, Supporting Information) has an optimized△*G*H\* value of −0.23 eV, which is more favorable than the counterpart in Rh electrocatalysts (Figure S8, Supporting Information), indicating more facilitated hydrogen desorption and thus boosting HER performance upon the introduction of Ru.

#### **2.3. Hydrazine-Assisted Water Electrolysis Study**

Together, we have further assembled the full electrolyzer with RhRu0.5 nanowires on carbon paper as both the anodic HzOR and cathodic HER electrocatalysts. Significantly, at a low mass loading of 0.20 mg cm<sup>−</sup>2, the electrolyzer with RhRu0.5-alloy wavy nanowires delivers a high current density of 100 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> at an ultralow voltage of 54 mV, and delivers an ultrahigh geometric current density of 853 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> at 0.6 V without any IR correction (Rs ≈0.5 Ohm in Figure S9, Supporting Information), which outperforms the electrolyzers employing Rh wavy nanowires (100 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> @165 mV, 586 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2@0.6 V) and commercial Pt/GC (100 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2@296 mV, 298 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2@0.6 V) (**Figure 4**A), and exhibits improved CP performance with much lower cell voltages (Figure 4B). EIS studies (Figure S9, Supporting Information) reveal a smaller charge transfer resistance for RhRu0.5-alloy nanowires (0.65 Ω) than that of Rh nanowires (1.38 Ω), which is consistent with the improved activity observed for the electrolyzer with RhRu0.5-alloy nanowires. The overall performance also notably outperforms all previously reported hydrazine-assisted water electrolyzers (**Table 1**). In addition, with the assistance of hydrazine, electrolyzer can work at a much lower voltage than typical water electrolyzer without hydrazine. For example, 1.53 V was lowered in the Pt/GC||Pt/GC and 1.59 V was lowered in the RhRu0.5-alloy wavy nanowire||RhRu0.5-alloy wavy nanowire electrolyzers (Figure 4C).

The electrolyzer employing RhRu0.5-alloy wavy nanowires also show excellent long-term performance with a stable lower cell voltage maintained for 10 hour at current density 100 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2. Importantly, although there is apparently an ≈30–50 mV

voltage increases after each 10 hour test, the voltage increase can be partially attributed to the consumption of hydrazine during long-term electrolysis. Indeed, the performance can be largely recovered by refreshing the electrolyte with the original hydrazine concentration. Overall the electrolyzer can work at 100 mA cm $^{-2}$  for 80 hour sho little irrperformance decay (Figure 4D; Figure S10, Supporting Information) with only 15.3 mV increase from the 1st to 8th 10 hour test cyc(Figure 4E).

We have further characterized the electrocatalysts on anode and cathode after CP test. The TEM studies show that wavy nanowire morphology was generally retained after CP test (Figure S11, Supporting Information). XRD studies reveal that the alloy phase remains after the CP test (Figure S12, Supporting Information). EDS studies also confirm the elemental distribution and elemental ratio show little change after CP test (Figures S13 and S14, Supporting Information). XPS studies further confirm the binding energy and the elemental ratio remain similar (Rh:Ru = 2.13:1.00 for cathode electrocatalysts and 2.18:1.00 for anode electrocatalysts, as shown in Figures S15 and S16, Supporting Information). ICP-MS also confirms that there is negligible electrocatalyst dissolution after CP test (<0.5% of the initial loading). These post reaction characterizations confirmed the robustness of our electrocatalysts. We also collected and measured the hydrogen gas produced from cathode compartment during the electrolysis via the water displacement method. The hydrogen measured experimentally is similar to the theoretical value (Figure S17, Supporting Information) and the Faradaic efficiency is calculated as 94.1%. In addition, we also carried out the characterization for the potential byproduct ammonia via spectrometry method, and detect any ammonia production from the electrolysis process (Figure S18, Supporting Information), which indicates nitrogen gas as the only detectable product and confirms the complete electrooxidation of hydrazine, consistent with 4-electron oxidation process determined from RDE studies.

In comparison with the conventional catalytic hydrazine decomposition for hydrogen production. Our system demonstrates a turnover frequency (TOF) value of 1009  $h^{-1}$  (calculated based on 100 mA current and detail is in the Supporting Information) at a negligible amount of electricity input (<0.1 V). In addition, by lowering the electrocatalyst loading to 0.10 mg (Figure S19, Supporting Information), we obtained the current of 80.2 mA at cell voltage of 54 mV, corresponding to a higher TOF value of  $1618 \, h^{-1}$ , which is much higher compared with the previously reported catalysts for hydrazine decomposition operating at room temperature (298–303 K) (Table 2).

#### 3. Conclusion

We developed RhRu $_{0.5}$ -alloy wavy nanowires via a facile solvothermal method. Thanks to the ultrahigh ECSA as well as the lowered d-band center in the RhRu $_{0.5}$  alloy, the resulting nanowire catalysts demonstrate an exceptional performance for electrocatalytic HzOR with ultrahigh MA and low overpotential in addition to the capability to achieve complete electrooxidation of the hydrazine, greatly outperforming the previously reported noble metal based electrocatalysts. Good HER performances were also observed, which together lead to the hydrazine-assisted water electrolyzer with unprecedented performance

(54 mV@100 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, 853 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>@0.6 V) as well as excellent long-term performances, which exceeds all the previously reported hydrazine-assisted water electrolyzers. Our study could open a pathway for efficiently converting the hazardous hydrazine into environmentally friendly products.

#### 4. Experimental Section

Chemicals: Sodium hexachlororhodate (III) (Na $_3$ RhCl $_6$ , analytical grade), ruthenium chloride hydrate (RuCl $_3$ ·xH $_2$ O, 38.0–42.0% Ru basis), sodium iodide (NaI, ACS reagent,  $\geq$ 99.5%), poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP, MW  $\approx$ 55 000), sodium ascorbate (NaAA, crystalline,  $\geq$ 98%), hydrazine solution (35 wt% in water), and commercial Pt/GC (20%) were all purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Carbon paper (Freudenberg H27) and anion exchange membrane (AEM) (FAS-50) were purchased from the fuelcell store. The electrolyzer device and the electric pump were purchased from Xi'an Yima Optoelec Co., Ltd.

Synthesis of RhRu<sub>0.5</sub>-Alloy Wavy Nanowires: The synthesis was carried out via a polyol method modified from the previous research. [22–23] 40 mg NaAA, 160 mg PVP, and 75 mg Nal were mixed with 1.00 mL aqueous solution of Na<sub>3</sub>RhCl<sub>6</sub> (10.0 mg mL<sup>-1</sup>), 0.333 mL aqueous solution of RuCl<sub>3</sub>·xH<sub>2</sub>O (10.0 mg mL<sup>-1</sup>, 40–42% metal basis) and dissolved after ultrasonication followed by adding 5.0 mL of ethylene glycol (EG). Then the vial was heated at 210 °C for 4 hours and the post-synthetic treatment were carried out by washing/centrifuging with ethanol/acetone and ethanol/hexane. The final products were re-dispersed in ethanol. For comparison, the Rh wavy nanowire and Ru nanoparticles were synthesized at the same conditions with the addition of individual noble metal precursor only.

Structural Characterizations: The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was carried out on FEI T12 transmission electron microscope operated at 120 kV. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) was carried out on a Panalytical X'Pert Pro X-ray powder diffractometer with Cu-K $\alpha$  radiation. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out with Kratos AXIS Ultra DLD spectrometer. The scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) imaging and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) mapping were

carried out on a JEOL Jem-300CF (Grand Arm) operated at 300 kV. The inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) was carried out to determine the elemental ratio and loading of the electrocatalysts.

*Electrochemical Measurements*: The electrochemical tests were carried out in a three-electrode cell system. The working electrode was an RDE with a geometric area of 0.196 cm<sup>2</sup> and the counter electrode was a Pt coil. The reference electrode was Hg/HgO (1.0 m KOH) and the potentials are converted against reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) after calibration. The homogeneous ethanol dispersion of the electrocatalysts was drop-cast onto the RDE surface and dried under room temperature with Rh loading of 1.0 μg (5.1 μg cm<sup>−</sup>2) for the RhRu0.5 and Rh wavy nanowire, and Ru loading of 1.00 μg (5.1 μg cm<sup>−</sup>2) for the Ru nanoparticle. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed in Ar-saturated 1.0 m KOH electrolyte with a scan rate of 50 mV s−<sup>1</sup> ranging from 0.05 to 1.10 V vs RHE to determine the electrochemically active surface area (ECSAHUPD). HzOR tests were carried out in Ar-saturated electrolyte of 1.0 m KOH, 0.010 m hydrazine via linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) at a series of rotation rates of 225, 400, 625, 900, 1225, and 1600 rppm, with potential scan rate of 20 mV s−<sup>1</sup> to study the electron transfer number. To probe the potential for real world applications, the HzOR tests were also carried out on the carbon-paper electrode with the loading of 1.0 μg cm−<sup>2</sup> in the electrolyte of 1.0 m KOH, 0.10 m hydrazine via LSV. The chronoamperometry (CA) tests were carried out at 0.20 V vs RHE for 1 hour. The HER performances were tested on RDE with loading of 1.0 μg (5.1 μg cm<sup>−</sup>2) via LSV in 1.0 m KOH electrolyte and the long-term performance was studied via CP at geometric current density of 10 mA cm−<sup>2</sup> for 10 h.

*Hydrazine-Assisted Water Electrolysis Test*: Membrane electrode assembly process was employed with AEM sandwiched between two carbonpaper electrodes with size of 1 cm<sup>2</sup> along with the PTFE gaskets and the electrocatalysts loading were 0.20 mg (Rh or Pt) for both anode and cathode. Electric pumps were employed to circulate the anolyte (1.0 m KOH + 1.0 m hydrazine) and catholyte (1.0 m KOH) at the flow rate of ≈120 mL min<sup>−</sup>1. LSV was carried out from −0.1 to 0.6 V at 2 mV s−<sup>1</sup> to obtain the polarization curves and CP at 100 mA cm−<sup>2</sup> was employed to probe the long-term performances of the electrolyzer. In order to detect the potential byproduct ammonia, 5% (w/v) Na3PO4 solution was used as buffer, 1.875 g phenol were dissolved in 3 mL methanol as phenol stock. Reagent A was prepared by mixing 3 mL phenol stock, 4 mL 1.0 mg mL−<sup>1</sup> sodium nitroprusside, and 13 mL water. Reagent B was prepared by mixing 12 ml commercial bleach (3.5% Cl) and 28 mL 27% NaOH. 0.1 mL sample was taken out from the catholyte and anolyte, respectively, and mixed with 0.4 mL buffer, 1 mL Reagent A, 0.5 mL Reagent B, and 3 mL water and then incubated under room temperature.

*Computational*: The Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) was used to carry out all the periodic DFT calculations. The Perdew–Burke– Ernzerhof (PBE) parametrization of the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) of the exchange-correlation functional was employed,[49] along with the dDsC dispersion correction to account for van der Waals interaction.[50] The cut off energy is 400 eV. The interactions between the atomic cores and electrons were described by the projector augmented wave (PAW) method.[51] All structures were optimized until the force and energy on each atom was less than 0.02 eV Å−<sup>1</sup> and 10−<sup>6</sup> eV, respectively. A dipole correction in the *z* direction was used for surface calculations. The transition state search was conducted with the climbing image nudged elastic band (CI-NEB) method, followed by the dimer method to converge the saddle point within 0.05 eV Å<sup>−</sup>1.

The calculations of Gibbs free energies include thermal effects, zeropoint energies, and entropic contributions, where translational, rotational, and vibrational degrees of freedom were taken into account for gaseous species. For surface species, the harmonic oscillator (HO) approximation was used and only vibrational contributions were considered. Using this approximation, the internal energy (*U*) and entropy of the adsorbate can be calculated as follows:

$$U(T) = E_{\text{elec}} + E_{\text{ZPE}} + \sum_{i}^{\text{harm DOF}} \frac{\epsilon_{i}}{e^{\epsilon_{i}/k_{\text{B}}T} - 1}$$
 (2)

$$S = k_{\rm B} \sum_{i}^{\rm harm\ DOF} \left[ \frac{\epsilon_{i}}{k_{\rm B}T \left( e^{\epsilon_{i}/k_{\rm B}T} - 1 \right)} - \ln \left( 1 - e^{-\epsilon_{i}/k_{\rm B}T} \right) \right] \tag{3}$$

where *ϵ<sup>i</sup>* are the harmonic energies for the adsorbate atoms.

The Helmholtz free energy (*F*) can hence be calculated as:

$$F(T) = U(T) - TS(T)$$
(4)

Assuming that the pV term in *H* = *U* + pV is negligible, the Helmholtz free energy can be used as an approximate for the Gibbs free energy since *G* ≈*F*. In total, four-layer (4×4)-RhRu(111) and four-layer (4×1)-RhRu(211) slabs were used in the calculations. For (211) surface, the most stable configuration was sampled for RhRu in the top two layers as a ratio of Rh:Ru as 2:1. The most stable one (Figure S20, Supporting Information) was chosen for further calculation. For these periodicities, the Brillouin zone was sampled using (5 ×5×1), (3×5×1) Gamma-point-centered K-meshes for (111) and (211) surfaces, respectively. The bottom two layers are fixed while the upper two layers were relaxed during optimization. The formation free energy (*G*f) of the hydroxylated surface shown in Figure S21 (Supporting Information) is calculated as:

$$G_{f} = G (RhRu(OH)_{x}) + x\mu (H) - G (RhRu) - xG (H_{2}O)$$

$$= G (RhRu(OH)_{x}) + x (1/2G (H_{2}) - eU - ln10 k_{B}T pH)$$

$$- G (RhRu) - xG (H_{2}O)$$
(5)

where *U* is the electrode potential at SHE scale. The pressures of H2 and H2O are set as 1 atm.

# High-Entropy Rare-Earth-Doped Pt Alloy Concave Nanocubes with High-Index Facets for Hydrazine Oxidation Electrocatalysis

Lu Wei,\* Jiayin Guo, Wanwan Wu, Panyan Chen, Heng Bian, Weiwei Li, and Xinsheng Zhao\*

High-entropy doping of multicomponent alloy nanocrystals enclosed by high-index facets (HIFs) is a great challenge due to the high surface energy from HIFs and their distinct standard reduction potential and atom sizes between different metals. Herein, a novel non-aqueous system, choline chloride-urea-based deep eutectic solvent, is proposed as a versatile medium to design a high-entropy rare-earth-doped Pt alloy PtYLaNdSmEuGdTbDyHoEr (HERED-Pt) concave nanocube with HIFs by the electrochemical method. Thanks to the high-index faceted characteristics and the high-entropy rare-earth-doped elemental synergy, the as-synthesized HERED-Pt concave nanocubes exhibit remarkable electrocatalytic performance for hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) with high current density (170.58 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>) and low on-set potential of 369.2 mV, which is superior than the quinary rare-earthdoped Pt alloy PtNdSmGdTbDy (QRED-Pt), single rare-earth-doped Pt alloys (PtY, PtLa, PtNd, PtSm, PtEu, PtGd, PtTb, PtDy, PtHo, PtEr), monometallic Pt concave nanocubes and commercial Pt/C catalyst, representing a state-ofthe-art electrocatalyst for HzOR. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the HERED-Pt(510) stepped plane can effectively reduce the energy barrier and exhibits higher electrocatalytic performance than that of QRED-Pt(510), single rare-earth-doped PtTb(510), and monometallic Pt(510) stepped planes for HzOR. This study provides a feasible high-entropy doping strategy to effectively achieve a highly efficient electrocatalyst for HzOR.

#### 1. Introduction

Direct hydrazine fuel cells (DHFCs) have attracted intensive interest in recent years, due to their high theoretical cell voltage of 1.61 V (higher than  $H_2/O_2$ -FCs, HCOOH/ $O_2$ -FCs, and  $CH_3OH/O_2$ -FCs), exceptional power density of 5.4 kW·h  $L^{-1}$  (significantly higher than hydrogen, 1.3 kW·h  $L^{-1}$ ), zero carbon dioxide ( $CO_2$ ) emission, and avoided electrocatalyst poisoning from

carbon monoxide (CO).<sup>[1]</sup> Although progress has been made on DHFCs, the actual open-circuit voltages (OCVs) outputted by most of them are still below their theoretical OCVs, which is attributed to the anodic hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR), which possesses an inherently large activation barrier and thus consumes a large quantity of energy.<sup>[2]</sup> Thus, it is highly desired to develop efficient HzOR electrocatalysts that can reduce this activation barrier and boost hydrazine electrooxidation efficiently at the anode in DHFCs.

Since the DHFCs were developed in the 1960s, the HzOR electrocatalysts have been extensively studied, including the noble metal (Pt, Pd, Ir, etc., and their alloys) and transition metal-based catalysts (Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, etc., and their alloys), as well as metal-free materials.[3] Among these advanced electrocatalysts, Ptbased catalysts have been excellent candidates and have been widely used as the anode catalysts for HzOR.[4] Moreover, the structure sensitivity of the electrocatalytic hydrazine oxidation on Pt electrodes indicates that the electrocatalytic activity of basal planes (i.e., low-index planes) increases in the order of Pt(110) > Pt(100) > Pt(111). [4b]

This is because the (111) and (100) planes are flat surfaces with closely packed atoms, while the (110) plane is an accidented surface with step atoms. These step atoms have lower coordination numbers than the flat atoms on (111) and (100) planes, which can easily interact with reactant molecules or intermediates and serve as active sites. Thus, introducing step atoms on the surfaces of catalysts generally promotes their electrocatalytic activity. It is well-known that high-index facets (HIFs), denoted by a set of Miller indices (hkl) with at least one index being larger than unit, are open-structure surfaces, which possess a high density of step atoms. In recent years, extensive efforts have focused on improving the electrocatalytic activity over the nanocrystals (NCs) bounded by HIFs.<sup>[5]</sup> It was found that among many electrocatalytic reactions, such as carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO<sub>2</sub>RR), <sup>[6]</sup> oxygen reduction reaction (ORR)/oxygen evolution reaction (OER),[7] nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR),[8] and small

organic molecules oxidation reactions,<sup>[9]</sup> the high-index faceted nanocatalysts exhibited excellent electrocatalytic activity.

Except for surface atomic structures, the composition of catalysts (i.e., electronic structures) also plays a crucial role in heterogeneous catalysis, via alloying or doping to adjust the adsorption strength of reactant molecules and intermediates.<sup>[10]</sup> Rareearth (RE) elements have a unique outer electronic structure and are generally introduced into Pt-based alloys to accelerate the electrocatalytic activity.[11] For example, binary PtRE alloys (PtSc, PtY, PtLa, PtCe, PtSm, PtGd, PtTb, PtDy, PtTm, etc.) exhibited superior electrocatalytic activity to that of monometallic Pt catalysts for ORR, NRR, and ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR).[12] Recently, high-entropy strategies (high-entropy alloy and highentropy doping) have been proven as an efficient method to improve electrocatalytic activity of HzOR due to their multi-element mixing brings up a diverse range of adsorption sites and a nearcontinuous binding energy distribution pattern.[13] The highentropy doping is usually achieved by introducing more than three kinds of atoms to replace the original atoms. Inspired by this idea, multi RE elements by high-entropy doped into the highindex faceted Pt-based alloy nanocrystals are quite promising for designing a novel catalyst with unexpected performance toward electrocatalytic HzOR. However, the synthesis of high-entropy RE-doped Pt-based alloys covered by HIFs is still a great challenge because of high surface energy from HIFs, and obvious differences in standard reduction potentials (as listed in Table S1, Supporting Information, the standard reduction potentials of RE are much more negative than that of Pt) and atomic sizes between Pt and RE metals.

Deep eutectic solvents (DESs), a new class of ionic liquid (IL) analogues, are formed from a eutectic mixture of quaternary ammonium salts (such as choline chloride) and hydrogen-bond donors (HBDs) (e.g., acids, amides, alcohols) with a constant molar ratio.[14] Compared with conventional ILs, DESs possess several advantages, such as their ease of preparation, easy availability from relatively inexpensive components, as well as being less chemically inert. Particularly, these liquids have a wide electrochemical window and the characteristic adsorption of urearelated species, which have been proven to be a versatile medium in electrochemically controlled synthesis of noble metal and their alloy nanocrystals.[12b,15] Herein, a choline chloride-urea (ChCl-U) based DES was proposed as a medium to design a HERED-Pt concave nanocube bounded with HIFs by the electrochemical method. The as-synthesized HERED-Pt concave nanocubes exhibit much enhanced electrocatalytic performance for HzOR, due to the high-index faceted characteristics and the high-entropy RE-doped elemental synergy.

#### 2. Results and Discussion

The HERED-Pt concave nanocubes were synthesized by the electrochemical method from a ChCl-U based DES, as a schematic shown in **Figure 1a**. In a typical preparation, the HERED-Pt concave nanocubes were deposited on a glassy carbon electrode (GCE) by electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV) with the scanning potential range from -0.20 to -1.50 V (vs Pt quasi-reference electrode) at 50 mV s<sup>-1</sup> at 80  $\pm$  2 °C for 60 cycles. The molar percentage ratio of the precursor Pt/Y/La/Nd/Sm/Eu/Gd/Tb/Dy/Ho/Er is

80/2/2/2/2/2/2/2/2/2. The electrodeposition behaviors of HERED-Pt on GCE in ChCl-U based DES are shown in Figure \$1 (Supporting Information). The CV profile of the HERED-Pt precursor solution resembles that of monometallic Pt, which can be explained by the predominant Pt content (80%). When the molar percentage ratio of the precursor Pt/Y/La/Nd/Sm/Eu/Gd/Tb/Dy/Ho/Er is 70/3/3/3/3/3/3/3/3/3, the concave nanocube structure is difficult to form, as shown in Figure S2 (Supporting Information). This is primarily attributed to the atomic size difference between Pt and RE atoms.[12b] With the increase of RE doping content, the lattice expansion is serious form the large RE atomic sizes, leading to the concave nanocube structure maintain difficulty. Therefore, the precursor solution with a molar composition of Pt/Y/La/Nd/Sm/Eu/Gd/Tb/Dy/Ho/Er = 80/2/2/2/2/2/2/2/2/2 was consequently chosen for highentropy doping implementation. To elucidate the effect of urea HBD on the formation of a concave nanocube, a choline chloride-ethylene glycol (ChCl-EG) based DES was selected as a candidate medium. As shown in Figure \$3 (Supporting Information), amorphous HERED-Pt nanoparticles were obtained when the urea HBD was replaced by ethylene glycol HBD, indicating that urea HBD plays a key role in the formation of concave nanocubes. The effect of urea HBD on the formation of a concave nanocube has been confirmed in our previous work.[16] Briefly, urea and ureylene (HNCONH), adsorbed at Pt(100) via two nitrogen atoms, are the most likely urea-derived complexes. Urea acting as an HBD stabilizes the {100} seed faces and inhibits growth along the <100> axis. Additionally, on small nanocubes, site reactivity follows corner > edge > facet. Newly generated Pt and RE atoms preferentially deposit at corners and edges, resulting in enhanced growth along the <111> and <110> directions. The synergistic interaction of these two factors promotes concave nanocube formation. To improve scalability and cost-effectiveness, HERED-Pt concave nanocubes were deposited onto carbon paper via electrodeposition. Figure S4 (Supporting Information) demonstrates that the resulting HERED-Pt concave nanocubes are highly monodisperse and feature a low Pt loading (0.35 wt.%), as listed in Table S2 (Supporting Information).

The morphology of the as-synthesized HERED-Pt nanoparticles has been confirmed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) as shown in Figures 1b and S5a (Supporting Information). The electrodeposited products comprise monodisperse, uniform nanocubes with an average size of 35.58  $\pm$  2.96 nm, as determined by the statistical histogram shown in Figure S5b (Supporting Information). Notably, the high-magnification SEM image (displayed in the insets at the top left of Figure 1b) reveals that the central position of each face of the cubes is a depression, indicating that the surface of the as-prepared HERED-Pt nanoparticles is a concave structure. Concave cube surfaces stabilize {hk0} high-index facets (HIFs) instead of {100} low-index facets (LIFs). [7c,9d,12b,15d] The scanning TEM energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (STEM-EDS) elemental mapping images (Figure 1c) show that all elements are homogeneously distributed throughout the whole nanoparticle, demonstrating that the RE elements are high-entropy doped into the whole concave nanocube. The composition of HERED-Pt concave nanocubes was further estimated by inductively

coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), as listed in Table S3 (Supporting Information). The result indicates that the molar percentage of Pt/Y/La/Nd/Sm/Eu/Gd/Tb/Dy/Ho/Er in the as-prepared HERED-Pt sample is 79.80/4.24/ 1.16/2.91/1.41/0.82/1.83/1.83/1.50/2.50/2.00. Similar to the mixing entropy of high-entropy alloy, the doping entropy (Δ*Sdoping*) is calculated by Equation (1). The calculated Δ*Sdoping* of the as-prepared HERED-Pt concave nanocubes is 2.2*R* (*>*1.5*R*), indicating HERED-Pt with a high-entropy doping structure.

$$\Delta S_{doping} = -R \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i \ln(x_i)$$

where *R* is the molar gas constant, *xi* is the molar percentage of the *i*th doping element in the total of doping elements.

To determine the Miller index (*hkl*) of the exposed surface, the as-synthesized HERED-Pt concave nanocubes were carefully characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Figure 1d shows a representative TEM image of an individual concave nanocube viewed along the [001] zone axis. Figure 1e displays a high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image recorded from the boxed area in Figure 1d. The surface of the concave nanocube exhibits a high-index {510} facet structure, comprising a periodic arrangement of five (100) sub-facets and one (110) sub-facet (Figure 1f). This result demonstrates convincingly that the surface of the as-synthesized HERED-Pt concave nanocubes mainly consists of high-index {510} facets, together with some other vicinal {410}, {310}, and {810} facets. The calculation result shows that these HIFs have a high density of step atoms (e.g., {510}: 2.55 × 1014 cm<sup>−</sup>2) with a coordination number of 6, which generally constitute active sites of electrocatalysts.[[17\]](#page-10-0) In addition, there is a single-crystal structure with well-defined fringes and a lattice spacing of 0.196 nm (Figure 1e), which can be assigned to the distance between two Pt(100) planes of the face-centered-cubic (*fcc*) structure of Pt.

The Miller index (*hkl*) of the exposed surface of HERED-Pt concave nanocubes is also identified by measuring the projected angles of the concave nanocube along the [001] zone axis (**Figure 2**[a1\)](#page-3-0) that was determined from the SAED pattern (as inset in Figure [2a1\)](#page-3-0). The projection angles were measured and listed in Figure [2a2.](#page-3-0) In comparison with the measured and theoretical values (listed in Table S4, Supporting Information), it can be determined that the as-synthesized HERED-Pt concave nanocubes are principally bounded by {510} HIFs, as well as vicinal {410} HIFs. The result is highly consistent with the HRTEM characterization (Figure 1d). Similarly, the surface structures of single REdoped Pt alloys (PtY, PtLa, PtNd, PtSm, PtEu, PtGd, PtTb, PtDy,

PtHo, PtEr) and monometallic Pt concave nanocubes (the corresponding SEM images are shown in Figures S6–S16, Supporting Information) were identified by this measure (as shown in Figure 2b1, 2–l1, 2), indicating that the surface of single RE-doped Pt alloys and monometallic Pt concave nanocubes are {510} HIFs and vicinal {410} HIFs. The corresponding atomic models of HIFs are exhibited in Figure 2a3–l3. In addition, all SAED patterns with the [001] zone axis (as inset in Figure 2a1–l1) display a square lattice, indicating that all as-synthesized concave nanocubes have a single-crystal structure.

Electrochemical cyclic voltammetry is also a powerful method to probe the surface structures of NCs of platinum group metals such as Pt, Pd, and Rh.[\[18\]](#page-10-0) **Figure 3**[a](#page-4-0) displays the CV curves recorded on the as-synthesized HERED-Pt and monometallic Pt concave nanocubes in 0.5 m H2SO4 solution at a scan rate of 50 mV s<sup>−</sup>1. It can be clearly observed that two pairs of quasi-reversible peaks recorded at ≈0.19 and 0.097 V (vs RHE) on the positive-going sweep (at ≈0.18 and 0.076 V (vs RHE) on the negative-going sweep) are attributed to hydrogen adsorption/desorption on Pt{100} and Pt{111} surfaces,

respectively. The {100} facets originate in the {100} sub-facets of high-index {*hk*0} facets, implying the as-synthesized HERED-Pt and monometallic Pt concave nanocubes bounded by high-index {*hk*0} facets,[\[12b,18c\]](#page-10-0) which is in agreement with the TEM results (Figures [1e](#page-2-0) and [2\)](#page-3-0). For {111} facets, they are derived from the imperfect and irregular nanoparticles. In addition, the electric charge density of oxygen adsorption from 0.90 to 1.30 V (vs RHE) on HERED-Pt concave nanocubes is much larger than that on monometallic Pt, indicating that the introduction of RE (Y, La, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er) on the Pt step surface can promote the oxygen adsorption. This result demonstrates that the HERED-Pt HIFs have a high affinity for oxygen species, which contribute to the promotion of the electrooxidation reaction.[\[18b,c\]](#page-10-0)

The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns (Figure 3b) indicate that three diffraction peaks at 40.0° 46.5°, 67.9° and 81.5° obtained from both HERED-Pt concave nanocubes and monometallic Pt samples match well with Pt(111), (200), (220) and (311) planes (JCPDS, No. 01-1194),[\[19\]](#page-11-0) respectively, except for the diffraction peak (marked with triangle) at 43.3° originating from the electrode substrate. Notably, the enlarged XRD shows that the negative shifts of the peak of the (111) facet in XRD patterns confirmed the lattice expansion after high-entropy RE doping (Figure 3c).[\[20\]](#page-11-0) The electronic structure and chemical nature of the samples were further analyzed by using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). As is shown in Figure 3d, the XPS result shows a high content of metallic Pt in both HERED-Pt and monometallic Pt samples. Significantly, the Pt 4f binding energy of the HERED-Pt concave nanocubes is blue-shifted in comparison with the monometallic Pt sample. The positions of Pt 4f7/2 are 71.54 and 70.87 eV for HERED-Pt concave nanocubes and monometallic Pt samples, respectively, which may imply electron transfer from RE (Y, La, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er) to Pt, forming highentropy doping. Significantly, the blue shift of the binding energy indicates an upshift of d-bands with respect to the Fermi level, which is closely related to the adsorption and desorption capability of reaction species over the catalyst.[\[21\]](#page-11-0) Figure S17 (Supporting Information) reveals the presence of Y 3d, La 4d, Nd 3d, Sm 3d, Eu 3d, Gd 4d, Tb 3d, Dy 3d, Ho 4d, and Er 4d, demonstrating the successful doping of RE elements into the Pt crystal lattice and forming the high-entropy doping structure.

The inset is the steady-state current density at 3000 s.

Further, X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) is carried out to determine the electronic and coordination structures of Pt atoms in HERED-Pt concave nanocubes. As shown in the X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) (Figure [3e\)](#page-4-0), the line intensity of the Pt L3-edge of HERED-Pt concave nanocubes is slightly higher than Pt foil but much lower than that of PtO2, demonstrating that the Pt species in HERED-Pt concave nanocubes are mainly in a metallic state. The extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) reveals that Pt in HERED-Pt displays three metal coordination, Pt─Pt, with a bond length of 2.2 Å; Pt─RE1 with a bond length of 2.5 Å, and Pt─RE2 with a bond length of 2.9 Å, which is likely caused by the mutual interaction of multiple elements for HERED-Pt (Figure [3f\)](#page-4-0). Wavelet transforms (WTs)-EXAFS spectrum was further carried out to confirm the atomic configuration of the HERED-Pt concave nanocubes. Figure [3g](#page-4-0) displays the WT-EXAFS contour plots of HERED-Pt, Pt foil, and PtO2, respectively, where the intense Pt─RE, Pt─Pt, and Pt─O coordination are illustrated by red color. Pt─Pt and Pt─RE coordination are observed at the radial distances of 2.3 and 2.7 Å (Y axis), respectively, in HERED-Pt concave nanocubes. Then, Pt─Pt (2.3 Å) and Pt─O (1.3 Å) coordination can be observed in the Pt foil and PtO2, which is in agreement with the EXAFS result.

The HERED-Pt concave nanocubes/GCE acted as the anode catalyst for evaluating the electrocatalytic performance of HzOR. To investigate the role of high-index faceted characteristics and the high-entropy RE-doped elemental synergy in HzOR, the single RE-doped Pt alloys (PtY, PtLa, PtNd, PtSm, PtEu, PtGd, PtTb, PtDy, PtHo, PtEr), monometallic Pt concave nanocubes, and commercial Pt/C catalyst were selected as control catalysts. **Figure 4**<sup>a</sup> exhibits the CV curves of the as-synthesized HERED-Pt concave nanocubes and control catalysts in 0.5 m H2SO4 + 50 mm NH2NH2 solution.

sured from the electric charge of hydrogen adsorption-desorption on Pt surfaces (Figure \$18, Supporting Information). As shown in Figure 4a, a distinct anodic peak is observed in all cases, which corresponds to the four-electron oxidation of hydrazine to N<sub>2</sub>.<sup>[22]</sup> Significantly, the absence of detectable ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>) byproducts during the HzOR<sup>[23]</sup> demonstrates exceptional selectivity for complete oxidation to N<sub>2</sub> (Figure S19, Supporting Information). Note that among all the test samples, the electrocatalytic activity of HzOR on HERED-Pt concave nanocubes increases significantly. To evaluate the catalytic performance of various catalysts and probe the origin of HzOR activity, the current density of HzOR on various catalysts at 0.94 V (vs RHE) in the positivegoing potential scan was summarized in Figure 4b. Obviously, the monometallic Pt concave nanocubes bounded by HIFs vield a higher current density of HzOR (32.66 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>) than that of the commercial Pt/C catalyst (5.87 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>), suggesting that the HIFs have enhanced electrocatalytic activity for HzOR. This is attributed to the HIFs with a high density of step atoms that serve as active sites. When RE (Y, La, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er) was solely doped to Pt HIFs, the single RE-doped Pt alloys (PtY: 45.56 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, PtLa: 57.55 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, PtNd: 56.66 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, PtSm: 54.89 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, PtEu: 46.65 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, PtGd: 52.20 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, PtTb: 55.28 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, PtDy: 46.39 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, PtHo: 56.31 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, PtEr: 34.14 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>) exhibit superior electrocatalytic activity of HzOR to that of monometallic Pt concave nanocubes (32.66 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>). Notably, when 10 RE (Y, La, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er) were simultaneously introduced to Pt HIFs, the HERED-Pt concave nanocubes exhibit the highest electrocatalytic activity (170.58 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>) for HzOR. Figure 4c summarizes the effect of RE doping on electrocatalytic HzOR performance, indicating that all doped RE elements exhibit an enhancing effect on the electrocatalytic HzOR. After single-metal doping with Y, La, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, and Er, the electrocatalytic HzOR performance of single RE-doped Pt-based alloys concave nanocubes show enhancements of 40%, 76%, 74%, 68%, 43%, 60%, 69%, 42%, 72%, and 5%, respectively, compared to that of undoped monometallic Pt concave nanocubes. Significantly, when 10 RE elements (Y, La, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er) were subjected to high-entropy doping, the electrocatalytic HzOR performance of the HERED-Pt was enhanced by 422%. However, when the number of doped elements was reduced from 10 to 5, the electrocatalytic HzOR performance of the catalyst correspondingly declined, but remained higher than that of single RE-doped Pt alloys. As shown in Figure S20 (Supporting Information), the electrocatalytic HzOR performance of HERED-Pt, QRED-Pt, and single RE-doped PtTb followed the order: HERED-Pt > QRED-Pt > PtTb. These results suggest that the high-entropy RE-doped elemental synergy on Pt HIFs is more favorable for electrocatalytic HzOR. Additionally, the HzOR on-set potential ( $E_{onset}$ ) of HERED-Pt concave nanocubes and the reference catalysts was compared in Figure 4d. In this work, the  $E_{\text{onset}}$  is set as the potential at the current density of 1 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. It can be clearly seen that the  $E_{\text{onset}}$  (369.2 mV) of HERED-Pt concave nanocubes is reduced compared with all control catalysts, including the single REdoped Pt alloys (PtY, PtLa, PtNd, PtSm, PtEu, PtGd, PtTb, PtDy, PtHo, PtEr), monometallic Pt concave nanocubes, and commercial Pt/C catalyst, which results from the favorable NH2NH2 adsorption and dehydrogenation ability on the HERED-Pt concave nanocubes. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy

(EIS) was employed to investigate the electrical conductivity and the kinetics of charge transfer at the electrode/electrolyte interface. Nyquist plots performed at a potential of 0.7 V (vs RHE) for the sample electrode are presented in Figure S21 (Supporting Information). Compared to the monometallic Pt sample, the HERED-Pt exhibits a significantly reduced charge transfer resistance ( $R_{\rm ct}$ ), indicative of enhanced charge transfer kinetics during the HzOR process on HERED-Pt surfaces. In addition, the solution resistance ( $R_{\rm S}$ ) of HERED-Pt (4.92  $\Omega$ ) is lower than that of the monometallic Pt sample (24.22  $\Omega$ ), suggesting that the electrical conductivity of the HERED-Pt sample was significantly enhanced after high-entropy RE doping.

The electrocatalytic stability is also an important parameter to characterize electrocatalytic performance for HzOR. Figure 4e compares the potentiostatic curves of HzOR on various catalysts at 0.64 V (vs RHE). Notably, the steady current density of HERED-Pt concave nanocubes stably stayed at 1.26 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> during the 7200 s test, which is significantly higher than that of the monometallic Pt concave nanocubes (0.55 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>) and commercial Pt/C catalyst (0.87 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>). In addition, the long-term cycling stability of HERED-Pt was further assessed via CV over 500 consecutive cycles. Figure 4f presents a comparative analysis of the initial and 500th cycle CV profiles for the HzOR catalyzed by the HERED-Pt. The result demonstrates negligible degradation in oxidation current density following 500 consecutive electrochemical cycles. The superior stability of HERED-Pt is primarily attributed to its robust structural integrity. As shown in Figure S22 (Supporting Information), the SEM and TEM characterization results reveal that after stability testing, the HERED-Pt retains its concave cubic morphology, with the surface predominantly composed of {510} HIFs and adjacent {410}, {610} HIFs. Molecular dynamics simulations have shown that nanocrystals enclosed by HIFs also exhibit good thermodynamic stability in their surface structural configurations.<sup>[24]</sup> Figure S23 (Supporting Information) shows that the as-prepared HERED-Pt retains a well-defined concave cubic structure, and no degradation in HzOR performance (175.26 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> at 0.94 V vs RHE) was observed after being stored under ambient conditions for one

To explore the influence of the supporting electrolyte, the electrocatalytic HzOR was further performed under alkaline conditions. Figure 4g displays the CV curves recorded on the HERED-Pt concave nanocubes and control catalysts (monometallic Pt concave nanocubes and commercial Pt/C catalyst) in a 0.1 м NaOH + 50 mm NH<sub>2</sub>NH<sub>2</sub> solution. Obviously, the HzOR activity of HERED-Pt concave nanocubes is higher than that of monometallic Pt and commercial Pt/C catalyst. The current density at 0.90 V (vs RHE) in the positive-going potential scan and  $E_{\text{onset}}$  on various catalysts were compared in Figure 4h. The HzOR current density of HERED-Pt concave nanocubes is 63.45 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, which is approximately twice and fourfold higher than that of monometallic Pt (31.69 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>) and commercial Pt/C catalyst (13.65 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>), respectively. Additionally, the  $E_{\text{onset}}$  of HERED-Pt concave nanocubes (174.9 mV) is lower than that of monometallic Pt (220.9 mV) and commercial Pt/C catalyst (254.9 mV). After chronoamperometry test, a superior steady current density can be observed for HERED-Pt concave nanocubes (0.58 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>) than that obtained on the monometallic Pt (0.38 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>) and commercial Pt/C catalyst (0.13 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>) (Figure 4i),

indicating that the HERED-Pt concave nanocubes exhibit good stability of HzOR. Based on the results in acidic and alkaline media (Figure [4\)](#page-5-0), it is concluded that the HzOR on the HERED-Pt concave nanocubes is more favorable in acidic media than in alkaline media. Notably, the as-synthesized HERED-Pt concave nanocubes exhibit higher electrocatalytic HzOR activity than most reported catalysts across both acidic and alkaline media (Table S5, Supporting Information).

DFT calculations were carried out to probe into the HzOR mechanism on the HERED-Pt high-index step surface. The computational details could be found in the Experimental section. The electronic structures of HERED-Pt(510), QRED-Pt(510), single RE-doped PtTb(510), and monometallic Pt(510) were first studied by DFT in **Figure 5**[a–d.](#page-7-0) The d-band centers of Pt in Pt(510), PtTb(510), QRED-Pt(510), and HERED-Pt(510) are −3.19, −3.02, −2.96, and −2.83 eV (vs Fermi level), respectively, indicating the upshift of d-bands of Pt after the high-entropy doping, which is consistent with the XPS result (Figure [3d\)](#page-4-0). The d-bands of Pt occur upshift, suggesting the electron transfer from RE (Y, La, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er) to Pt. Bader charge analysis[\[25\]](#page-11-0) was conducted to elucidate the distinct electronic contributions of individual rare earth elements. As illustrated in Figure [5e,](#page-7-0) the calculated electron depletion values of doped rare-earth elements in HERED-Pt(510) are 1.45, 1.30, 0.87, 1.08, 1.57, 1.23, 1.29, 1.36, 1.39, and 1.43 |e|/atom for Y, La, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, and Er, respectively, while Pt exhibits an electron accumulation of 0.32 |e|/atom. To investigate the effect of high-entropy doping on the activity of HzOR, the QRED-Pt(510), PtTb(510), and Pt(510) planes were considered as the control group. The optimized lattices of unit cells are 4.01 Å for HERED-Pt(510), 3.96 Å for QRED-Pt(510), 3.97 Å for PtTb(510), and 3.93 Å for Pt(510), indicating the lattice expansion after RE high-entropy doping. This result is also consistent with analyses by the XRD (Figure [3b\)](#page-4-0). The corresponding unit cells are shown in Figure S24 (Supporting Information). In this work, the Pt─Pt bridge site on HERED-Pt(510) stepped surface was considered as active sites for an alternating HzOR mechanism.[\[13\]](#page-10-0) The calculated Gibbs free energies of elementary steps for electrocatalytic HzOR on HERED-Pt(510), QRED-Pt(510), PtTb(510), and Pt(510) surfaces were listed in **Table 1**, and the Gibbs free energy profiles were plotted in Figure [5f.](#page-7-0) The optimized intermediates were displayed in Figure S25 (Supporting Information). It was identified that the initial activation of \*N2H4 to yield \*N2H3 on the surface, \*N2H4 <sup>→</sup> \*N2H3 <sup>+</sup> <sup>H</sup><sup>+</sup> <sup>+</sup> <sup>e</sup><sup>−</sup>, was the ratedetermining step with the reaction energy of 0.456 eV on Pt(510). For HERED-Pt(510), QRED-Pt(510), and PtTb(510), however, the rate-determining step is \*N2H3 → \*N2H2 + H<sup>+</sup> + e<sup>−</sup> elementary step with the reaction energy of 0.187, 0.226, and 0.275 eV, respectively. It can clearly be realized from the energy profile that the HERED-Pt(510) is more active than QRED-Pt(510), PtTb(510), and Pt(510) toward HzOR with lower energy barriers. This result indicates that multi RE metals introduced to the Pt step surface can effectively accelerate the HzOR process with the high-entropy RE-doped elemental synergy, which also explains why the good electrocatalytic performance of HzOR on the HERED-Pt concave nanocubes (Figure [4\)](#page-5-0). Based on the preceding analysis, a plausible HzOR mechanism on the HERED-Pt(510) stepped surface can be described as follows: Initially, hydrazine (N2H4) molecules adsorb preferentially at the Pt step sites through the formation of Pt─N coordination bonds. This chemisorption process is subsequently followed by sequential dehydrogenation steps, during which hydrogen atoms are progressively removed from the adsorbed N2H4 species. Ultimately, the complete dehydrogenation pathway results in the liberation of N2 as the final reaction product, as schematically illustrated in Figure [5g.](#page-7-0)

## **3. Conclusion**

In conclusion, a ChCl-U-based DES was proposed as a medium to design HERED-Pt concave nanocubes bounded with HIFs by the electrochemical method. The HERED-Pt concave nanocubes enclosed by {510} HIFs were obtained through this route for the first time. It was found that urea HBD plays a key role in the formation of the concave nanocube. Thanks to the high-index faceted characteristics and the high-entropy RE-doped elemental synergy, the as-synthesized HERED-Pt concave nanocubes with HIFs exhibit superior electrocatalytic performance of HzOR to that of the QRED-Pt, single RE-doped Pt alloys (PtY, PtLa, PtNd, PtSm, PtEu, PtGd, PtTb, PtDy, PtHo, PtEr), monometallic Pt concave nanocubes, and commercial Pt/C catalyst. In addition, the HERED-Pt exhibits a significantly reduced *R*ct, indicative of enhanced charge transfer kinetics during the HzOR process on HERED-Pt surfaces. DFT calculations reveal that the d-band center of Pt upshifts observably after the high-entropy doping, and the rate-determining step of HzOR on HERED-Pt(510) stepped surface is \*N2H3 to \*N2H2. Cooperating with multi RE metals, HERED-Pt(510) exhibits higher electrocatalytic activity of HzOR than that of QRED-Pt(510), single RE-doped PtTb(510), and monometallic Pt(510) planes. This work highlights the importance of electrochemically controlled synthesis of high-entropy RE-doped Pt-based alloy concave nanocubes enclosed by HIFs and unveils the high-index stepped surface with

RE high-entropy doping for enhanced electrocatalytic activity of HzOR.

Millipore water (18.0 M $\Omega$  cm) was provided by a Milli-Q Lab apparatus (Nihon Millipore Ltd.)

Preparation of Deep Eutectic Solvent: The ChCl-U based DES was prepared by mixing ChCl and urea with a constant molar ratio of 1:2 in a round-bottomed flask. [15,18a,c] Then, the mixture was constantly stirred at 900 rpm at 80  $^{\circ}\text{C}$  until forming a uniformly colorless liquid, called ChClurea based DES. The choline chloride-ethylene glycol (ChCl-EG) based DES was prepared at room temperature, under otherwise identical conditions with ChCl-U based DES.

Synthesis of HERED-Pt Concave Nanocubes: The HERED-Pt concave nanocubes were electrodeposited on GCE by CV method with scanning potential range between -0.20 and -1.50 V at 50 mV s<sup>-1</sup> at  $80 \pm 2$  °C for 60 cycles in ChCl-U based DES solutions containing K2PtCl6 (8 mm) and ten rare earth nitrate (concentration of each rare earth nitrate is 0.2 mm, rare earth nitrate:  $Y(NO_3)_3$ ,  $La(NO_3)_3$ ,  $Nd(NO_3)_3$ ,  $Sm(NO_3)_3$ ,  $Eu(NO_3)_3$ ,  $Gd(NO_3)_3$ ,  $Tb(NO_3)_3$ ,  $Dy(NO_3)_3$ ,  $Ho(NO_3)_3$ ,  $Er(NO_3)_3$ ). The identical precursor solution was used for all batches during synthesis. All electrodeposition experiments were carried out in a standard three-electrode cell with a platinum wire counter electrode and a platinum quasi-reference electrode. The working electrode was a glassy carbon electrode (GCE,  $\Phi$ = 6 mm) that was polished mechanically by using alumina powders with sizes of 1.0 and 0.3  $\mu m,$  respectively. The HERED-Pt concave nanocubes were electrodeposited onto carbon paper under the same conditions as those employed for deposition onto a GCE. The dimensions of the carbon paper were  $10 \text{ mm} \times 5 \text{ mm}$ .

Synthesis of Single RE-Doped Pt Alloys Concave Nanocubes: Single REdoped Pt alloys (PtY, PtLa, PtNd, PtSm, PtEu, PtGd, PtTb, PtDy, PtHo, PtEr) concave nanocubes were synthetized in ChCl-U based DES solutions containing 8 mm of  $\rm K_2PtCl_6$  and 0.2 mm of  $\rm Y(NO_3)_3$ ,  $\rm La(NO_3)_3$ ,  $\rm Nd(NO_3)_3$ ,  $Sm(NO_3)_3$ ,  $Eu(NO_3)_3$ ,  $Gd(NO_3)_3$ ,  $Tb(NO_3)_3$ ,  $Dy(NO_3)_3$ ,  $Ho(NO_3)_3$ , Er(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>), respectively, at the other conditions remain unchanged.

Synthesis of Quinary RE-Doped Pt Alloy Concave Nanocubes: Quinary RE-doped Pt alloy (PtNdSmGdTbDy) concave nanocubes were synthetized in ChCl-U based DES solutions containing K<sub>2</sub>PtCl<sub>6</sub> (8 mm) and five rare earth nitrates (concentration of each rare earth nitrate is 0.2 mm, rare earth nitrate:  $Nd(NO_3)_3$ ,  $Sm(NO_3)_3$ ,  $Gd(NO_3)_3$ ,  $Tb(NO_3)_3$ ,  $Dy(NO_3)_3$ ), at the other conditions remain unchanged.

Synthesis of Monometallic Pt Concave Nanocubes: Monometallic Pt concave nanocubes were synthesized in ChCl-U based DES solutions containing 8 mm of K<sub>2</sub>PtCl<sub>6</sub>, while the other conditions remain unchanged.

Preparation of Commercial Pt/C Catalyst Electrode: The preparation steps are as follows: 5 mg of the commercial Pt/C catalyst and 10  $\mu$ L Nafion solution (5 wt.%) were mixed with 5 mL ultrapure water/absolute ethanol mixed solution (the volume ratio of ultrapure water to absolute ethanol is 1:2), then dispersed by ultrasonic treatment for 10 min. Then, take 8 µL of the treated commercial Pt/C catalyst ink and drip it onto the GCE surface and dry using infrared. The Pt loading of the as-synthesized commercial Pt/C catalyst electrode was 8 μg.

Materials Characterization: Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained on a SU8010 electron microscope. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), elemental mapping, and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) measurements were performed by using a FEI Tecnai-F20 electron microscope at an operating voltage of 200 kV. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected using an X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku D/MAX 2500 v/pc, Japan) with a Cu Ka radiation source ( $\lambda = 1.5406 \text{ Å}$ ). The surface electronic structure was analyzed by using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) on an ESCALAB 250Xi spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, USA). All measured values of the electron binding energy were calibrated with respect to the principal peak of C 1s at 284.5 eV as the internal standard. The alloy composition of samples was quantified by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS, Thermo ICAP-QC).

X-Ray Absorption Spectroscopy Measurement and Analysis: The XAS samples were electrodeposited on carbon paper. The Pt L3-edge EXAFS and XANES spectra were measured at the 14W1 beamline of Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF), China. All XAS data were processed by the ATHENA module of the Demeter software packages. [26] Wavelet transformation (WT) spectra were also employed using the software package developed by Funke and Chukalina and the Morlet wavelet with  $\kappa = 10$  and

Electrocatalytic HzOR Measurements: The electrochemical tests of HzOR were performed in a three-electrode cell. Pt foil and saturated calomel electrode (SCE) were used as counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively. Prior to each electrochemical measurement, the electrolyte solution was deoxygenated by bubbling high-purity N2 for 30 min. The CV measurements of HzOR were conducted in 0.5 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> + 50 mм NH<sub>2</sub>NH<sub>2</sub> and/or 0.1 м NaOH + 50 mм NH<sub>2</sub>NH<sub>2</sub> solutions, respectively, scan rate: 50 mV s<sup>-1</sup>, temperature: 25 °C. All electrochemical results were presented against the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). The conversion between potentials versus SCE and versus RHE is performed using the following equation:

$$E(RHE) = E(SCE) + 0.2438 + 0.059 * pH$$
 (2)

Indophenol Blue Indicator Measurements: Byproducts NH<sub>3</sub> were detected by the indophenol blue indicator method. [27] In brief, take 1 mL of the solution after electrocatalytic oxidation of hydrazine solution, then add 2 mL solution containing 1 M sodium hydroxide, 5 wt.% sodium citrate, and 5 wt.% salicylic acid, 1 mL NaClO solution, and 0.2 mL nitrofuran solution, respectively. The absorbance at 656 nm was measured after 1 h at room temperature.

DFT Calculations: The theoretical calculations were performed using density functional theory (DFT), as implemented in the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP).[28] The projector-augmented wave method (PAW)[29] was used to describe the ion-electron interaction. The plane wave cut-off of 450 eV was used as the basis set. A 3  $\times$  3  $\times$  1  $\Gamma$ -centered Monkhorst-Pack grid was to sample the Brillouin zone for geometry optimization. The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE)[30] functional was used to describe the interacting electron exchange-correlation energy, with an electronic convergence criterion of  $10^{-5}$  eV and an ionic convergence criterion of  $10^{-2}$  eV Å<sup>-1</sup>. Six elementary reaction steps are considered:

$$* + N_2 H_4 \rightarrow * N_2 H_4 \tag{3}$$

$$* N_2 H_4 \rightarrow * N_2 H_3 + H^+ + e^-$$
 (4)

$$* N_2 H_3 \rightarrow * N_2 H_2 + H^+ + e^-$$
 (5)

$$* N_2 H_2 \rightarrow * N_2 H + H^+ + e^-$$
 (6)

$$* N_2 H \rightarrow * N_2 + H^+ + e^-$$
 (7)

$$* N_2 \rightarrow * + N_2 \tag{8}$$

<span id="page-10-0"></span>The free energy (*G*) of each adsorbed intermediate is calculated from the total DFT ground state energy (*E*DFT) corrected by the zero-point energy (*E*ZPE), entropy effect (*TS*), and applied potential (*U*) according to the equation:

$$G = E_{DFT} + E_{ZPE} - TS - eU$$
 (9)

The correction of entropy and ZPE items was taken from vibrational contribution using a finite differences approach. The proton energy was determined to be half that of the H2 molecule. Bader charge analysis[\[25\]](#page-11-0) was performed to clarify the individual effect of each rare earth element.

**The hydrazine-assisted water splitting (HzAWS) is promising for energy-saving hydrogen production. However, developing efficient bifunctional catalysts that exert hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) at industrial-grade current densities remains challenging. Here, RuC-NiCoP catalyst, ruthenium clusters (RuC) immobilized onto NiCoP, is developed to elucidate the superior performance of RuC in enhancing bifunctional electrocatalytic activity over ruthenium single atoms (RuSA). The RuC-NiCoP achieves current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> for HER and HzOR with working potentials of −10 and −89 mV, respectively, outperforming RuSA-NiCoP (−16 and −65 mV). During HzAWS, a cell voltage reduction of 1.77 V at 300 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> is observed compared to overall water splitting. Density functional theory calculations reveal that RuC improves the adsorption energy for H2O and N2H4, optimizes the H\* intermediate desorption, and reduces the dehydrogenation barrier from \*N2H3 to \*N2H2. Additionally, the direct hydrazine fuel cell with a RuC-NiCoP anode delivers an impressive power density of 226 mW cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> and enables a self-powered hydrogen production system, achieving an unprecedented hydrogen production rate of 4.9 mmol cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> h<sup>−</sup>1. This work offers a new perspective on developing efficient sub-nanoscale bifunctional electrocatalysts and advancing practical energy-saving hydrogen production techniques.**

**1. Introduction**

Replacing the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with the hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) is a promising energy-saving strategy for improving the efficiency of electrocatalytic water splitting for green hydrogen (H2) production.[\[1–5\]](#page-10-0) Additionally, the highly theoretical voltage (1.56 V) and impressive theoretical power density (5.42 Wh g<sup>−</sup>1) of direct hydrazine fuel cells (DHzFCs)[\[6\]](#page-10-0) have inspired efforts to develop self-powered H2 production systems. These systems combine a DHzFC with a hydrazine-assisted water splitting (HzAWS) device, making them ideal for mobile applications, field activities, emergencies, and off-grid areas.[\[7–15\]](#page-10-0)

HzOR prefers to operate in alkaline media, while hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is energy-intensive under these conditions due to the sluggish hydrolysis.[\[16\]](#page-10-0) Therefore, developing highly efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts is imperative to simultaneously achieve exceptional performance for both HzOR and HER in the HzAWS process.[\[17\]](#page-10-0) This would reduce costs and enhance benefits of selfpowered hydrogen production systems. Transition metals,[\[18\]](#page-10-0) their alloys,[\[19–21\]](#page-10-0) sulfide,[\[22\]](#page-10-0) selenide,[\[23,24\]](#page-10-0) nitrides,[\[13,25\]](#page-10-0) and phosphides[\[26,27\]](#page-10-0) have shown favorable

activity toward HzOR. However, their inferior HER activity limits their performance in self-powered H2 evolution systems. Researchers have attempted to enhance the bifunctional electrocatalytic activity of these catalysts through various strategies,

including heterostructure interface fabrication, [13,28,29] element doping,[30-32] noble metal incorporation,[16,33] and hierarchically nanostructure construction.[34,35] Noble metals such as Ru, Ir, Pd, and Rh are especially sought after due to their exceptional HER activity and significant HzOR performance, [36-38] making them ideal candidates for enhancing the bifunctional electrocatalytic activity of transitions metal-based catalysts. Efforts have been devoted to achieving atomic-level dispersion of these noble metals to maximize their utilization efficiency and costeffectiveness.[39-42] Among these noble metals, Ru has gained much attention for its cost-effectiveness and comparable adsorption and desorption capacity for H\* intermediates to Pt.[16,43] Recent studies have shown that integrating Ru single atom (Ru<sub>SA</sub>) with support catalysts can enhance HER and HzOR. [9,16,40] However, developing catalysts that meet industrial-scale requirements for energy-efficient green H2 production remains challenging. It has been reported that the ruthenium cluster (Ru<sub>C</sub>) displays a superior contribution to both the alkaline HER and OER in overall water splitting (OWS) compared to Rusa due to its improved H<sub>2</sub>O dissociation capability.[10,44-48] In addition, clusters with multiple sites could provide enhanced flexibility in electronic modulation, resulting in multifunctional active sites with varied electronic properties. These inspired high expectations for the excellent bifunctional electrocatalytic activity toward both HzOR and HER of Ruc-decorated transition metal-based catalysts.

In this work, the Ru<sub>C</sub>-NiCoP catalyst was synthesized via electrodepositing Ru<sub>C</sub> species on a 3D porous flower-like NiCoP for bifunctional HER and HzOR. Rusa-NiCoP catalyst obtained through a similar method was used for comparison. The comparison investigation was executed to elucidate the distinct contributions of Ru<sub>C</sub> and Ru<sub>SA</sub> toward bifunctional electrocatalytic activity, as well as to analyze the underlying mechanism. As a result, Ru<sub>C</sub> outperforms Ru<sub>SA</sub> in enhancing the bifunctional electrocatalytic activity of the support NiCoP catalyst. Specifically, the  $Ru_c$ -NiCoP requires ultralow working potentials of -10and -89 mV to achieve 10 and 100 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> for HER and HzOR, respectively, outperforming the Ru<sub>SA</sub>-NiCoP (-16 and -65 mV). Moreover, a two-electrode electrolyzer with Ru<sub>C</sub>-NiCoP as both anode and cathode catalysts exhibited a cell voltage drop of 1.77 V for HzAWS compared to OWS when generating a current density of 300 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, demonstrating remarkable efficiency in energy-saving H<sub>2</sub> production. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the electrodeposited Ru<sub>C</sub> enhances surface charge distribution, resulting in improved interfacial charge transfer ability. Ru<sub>C</sub> also improves the adsorption energy for H<sub>2</sub>O and N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> molecules, optimizes the desorption of H\* intermediates, and reduces the energy barrier of the rate-determining dehydrogenation step from \*N2H3 to \*N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>, leading to enhanced bifunctional electrocatalytic activity for HER and HzOR. Additionally, the DHzFC equipped with a Ru<sub>c</sub>-NiCoP anode exhibits a peak power density of 226 mW cm<sup>-2</sup>. Our self-powered H<sub>2</sub> production system attained an unprecedented H<sub>2</sub> yield rate of 4.9 mmol cm<sup>-2</sup> h<sup>-1</sup> (120 mL cm<sup>-2</sup> h<sup>-1</sup>). This study provides insights into balancing cost control and performance requirements in using noble metals for green H<sub>2</sub> production and advances practical self-powered H2 production systems.

### 2. Results and Discussion

#### 2.1. Materials Characterization

Porous nickel foam (PNF, Figure S1, Supporting Information), prepared by dynamic hydrogen bubble template electrodeposition, is used as the substrate. The Ru<sub>C</sub>-NiCoP catalyst was then synthesized on the PNF by phosphating nickel-cobalt doublelayer hydroxide (NiCoLDH) precursor and subsequently electrodepositing Ru clusters, as schematically shown in Figure 1a. Briefly, NiCoLDH nanosheets (Figure S2, Supporting Information) were grown on the PNF via a facile electrodeposition process. Subsequently, the NiCoLDH nanosheets array was calcined with NaH2PO2 as a P source to form the NiCoP nanosheets (Figure S3, Supporting Information). Then, the Ru<sub>C</sub>-NiCoP was obtained through the electrodeposition of Ru<sub>C</sub> onto the surfaces of the NiCoP nanosheets. The Rusa-NiCoP catalyst was synthesized by a similar electrodeposition method except for varying the current density and the feeding amount of RuCl<sub>3</sub>. The Ru<sub>C</sub>-NiCoP (Figure 1b,c; Figure S4, Supporting Information) and Rusa-NiCoP (Figure S5, Supporting Information) catalysts both exhibit 3D porous flower-like structures, closely resembling the microstructure of the NiCoP catalyst. This unique architecture offers significant advantages in terms of augmenting the specific surface area of the catalysts, consequently increasing its electrochemical active surface area. Moreover, this well-designed morphology facilitates the efficient release of surface gas products, thereby expediting mass transfer during electrochemical reactions. [6,49] The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images (Figure S6, Supporting Information) reveal the presence of CoP and NiCoP phase in the crystal regions of the NiCoP nanosheets, indicating the formation of Ni-doped CoP species. The corresponding energy dispersion spectra (EDS) confirms a uniform distribution of Co, Ni, and P elements within the NiCoP nanosheets. Furthermore, the crystal texture observed in both Ru<sub>C</sub>-NiCoP (Figure 1d,e) and Ru<sub>SA</sub>-NiCoP (Figure S7, Supporting Information) is consistent with that observed in the pristine NiCoP catalyst. Additionally, the high-angel annular dark-field scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM) images in Figure 1f,g enable clear discrimination of the randomly and uniformly distributed states of Ru<sub>C</sub> or Ru<sub>SA</sub> on the surfaces of NiCoP nanosheets. By overlapping a rapidly scanned Ni map onto the HAADF-STEM image of Ruc-NiCoP (Figure 1h), it is evident that the brighter Ru<sub>C</sub> spots are precisely situated within the voids of the Ni distribution. Moreover, EDS mapping images (Figure 1i-l) reveal a homogeneous distribution of the Ru element on the surface of Ru<sub>C</sub>-NiCoP. The element composition results from the EDS mapping presented in Figure S8 (Supporting Information) demonstrate that the Ru<sub>C</sub>-NiCoP contains significantly higher levels of Ru (3.2 wt%) compared to Ru<sub>SA</sub>-NiCoP (0.9 wt%). The aforementioned observations suggest that the process of Ru electrodeposition does not induce any alteration in the micromorphology and crystal texture of the support NiCoP.

The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the as-prepared samples are presented in **Figure 2a** to gain further insights into their compositions. All the samples exhibit three prominent diffraction peaks at 44.5°, 51.8°, and 76.4°, which can be attributed to the nickel foam (NF) skeleton structure. After electrodeposition

of NiCoLDH, only a few weak and broad peaks at 10.4°, 21°, and 34.4° are observed on the NiCoLDH pattern in comparison to that of PNF. Following phosphorization treatment, however, distinct diffraction peaks at 31.6°, 35.3°, 36.3°, and 48.1° corresponding to the (011), (200), (111), and (211) planes of CoP (JCPDS No. 29–0497) are observed on the NiCoP pattern. [7,9] Combined with SEM and TEM observations, it can be inferred that the NiCoLDH nanosheets underwent phosphorization process leading to the formation of Ni-doped CoP species. Moreover, the diffraction patterns of Ru<sub>C</sub>-NiCoP and Ru<sub>SA</sub>-NiCoP closely resemble that of NiCoP without any observable peaks attributed to the presence of Ru crystal, suggesting that the size of Ru<sub>C</sub> particles is below the detection limit of XRD analysis.

The X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were employed to analyze the surface chemical bonding states of Ru<sub>C</sub>-NiCoP, Ru<sub>SA</sub>-NiCoP, and NiCoP. As shown in Figure 2b, the Ru 3p spectrum of the Ru<sub>SA</sub>-NiCoP exhibits two peaks centered at 463.38 and 486.08 eV, providing compelling evidence for the presence of positively charged valence state Ru atoms.<sup>[9]</sup> In comparison, the Ru 3P spectrum of the Ru<sub>C</sub>-NiCoP reveals two distinct peaks centered at 461.98 and 484.08 eV, suggesting the existence of metallic Ru atoms within Ru<sub>C</sub> species.<sup>[44,45,50]</sup> Moreover, the prominent peak centered at 280.18 eV on the Ru 3d spectrum (Figure S9a, Supporting Information) of the Ru<sub>C</sub>-NiCoP can be attributed to Ru  $3d_{5/2}$  of Ru<sup>0</sup>, providing evidence for the presence of Ru-Ru bonding within Ru<sub>C</sub> species.<sup>[10,16]</sup> Additionally, an enhanced

intensity is observed for the peak centered at 282.28 eV corresponding to Ru  $3d_{5/2}$  of Ru<sup> $\delta+$ </sup> on the Ru 3d spectrum of the Ruc-NiCoP compared to that of Rusa-NiCoP, indicating an improved interaction between Ru<sub>C</sub> species and the NiCoP support. Figure 2c shows the high-resolution of Co 2P spectra. Specifically, the NiCoP spectrum demonstrates two distinct peaks at 778.98 and 793.88 eV, corresponding to  $2p_{3/2}$  and  $2p_{1/2}$  of  $Co^{\delta+}$  (where  $\delta$  is close to 0) in the Co-P bond.<sup>[7]</sup> The peaks at 781.28, 782.88, and 798.18 eV, along with two broad shakeup satellite peaks at 785.88 and 801.68 eV, are indexed to the  $2p_{3/2}$  and  $2p_{1/2}$  of  $Co^{2+}$ in Co-PO<sub>x</sub> (derived from the surface oxidation of NiCoP). [51] After Ru<sub>SA</sub> electrodeposition, the spin-orbit peaks of Co<sup>2+</sup> 2p<sub>3/2</sub> in the spectrum of the Ru<sub>SA</sub>-NiCoP exhibit a noticeable positive shift, accompanied by a slight negative shift for the peaks of  $Co^{\delta+}$   $2p_{3/2}$ . This observation suggests an electron transfer from Rusa species to surrounding Co atoms, thereby modulating the interfacial electronic distribution state and facilitating interfacial charge transfer. In comparison, following Ruc electrodeposition, the peak of Co<sup>2+</sup> 2p<sub>3/2</sub> at 782.88 in the spectrum of the Ru<sub>C</sub>-NiCoP exhibits enhanced broadening, while the peak of  $Co^{\delta+}$   $2p_{3/2}$  demonstrates a significant increase in intensity and a slight negative shift. These findings suggest that, in comparison to Rusa, Ruc exerts a more pronounced modulatory effect on the electron environment. Similarly, as shown in Figure S9b (Supporting Information), the Ni 2p spectra reveal that peaks located at 857.88 and 874.48 eV can be associated with  $2p_{3/2}$  and  $2p_{1/2}$  of Ni<sup>2+</sup>, respectively, which display a significant negative shift after the electrodeposition of Ru<sub>C</sub> or Ru<sub>SA</sub>. This observation signifies the electron charging state of Ni atoms and also underscores the electron-donating role exerted by Ru<sub>C</sub> and Ru<sub>SA</sub>. Figure 2d exhibits the high-resolution P 2p spectra. The peaks observed at 129.38 and 130.38 eV on the NiCoP spectrum correspond to P 2p<sub>3/2</sub> and P 2p<sub>1/2</sub> spin-orbit in P-M bonds of metal phosphides, respectively.<sup>[9]</sup> The broad peak at 134.38 eV is ascribed to oxidized phosphorus species resulting from surface oxidation of NiCoP nanosheets. After electrodeposition of  $Ru_C$  or  $Ru_{SA}$ , the intensities of the peaks corresponding to P  $2p_{3/2}$  and P  $2p_{1/2}$  demonstrate a noticeable enhancement, indicating a strengthened bonding P-M affected by either Ru<sub>C</sub> or Ru<sub>SA</sub>. Evidently, the impact induced by Ru<sub>C</sub> is more pronounced.

The valence state and coordination mode of the Co element in NiCoP were initially confirmed through the X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and Fourier-transformed extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectra (EXAFS) of the Co K-edge, as shown in Figure S9c,d (Supporting Information). The absorption edge energy of Co K-edge in NiCoP lies between that of Co foil and CoO, suggesting an average valence state of Co is between 0 and +2, which aligns with the XPS results. The peak at 1.72 Å in the EXAFS of NiCoP is attributed to the Co-P bond, distinct from the Co-O bond (1.5 Å) in CoO and the Co-Co bond (2.17 Å) in Co foil, confirming the presence of CoP species. Furthermore, the X-ray absorption fine structure spectra (XAFS) were employed to further compare the local coordination environment and chemical valence state of electrodeposited Ru<sub>C</sub> and Ru<sub>SA</sub> on the surface of the NiCoP support. According to the normalized XANES spectra of the Ru K-edge shown in Figure 2e, it can be observed that the absorption edge energy of the Ru Kedge in the Ru<sub>SA</sub>-NiCoP closely approximates that of RuO<sub>2</sub>, indicating a predominant average oxidation state of +4 for the Ru

atoms within the Ru<sub>SA</sub> species.<sup>[9,16]</sup> This implies that Ru<sub>SA</sub> exhibits electron deficiency and acts as the electron donor to its surrounding atoms, thereby confirming its coordination with these atoms. In comparison, the adsorption edge energy of the Ru Kedge in the Ru<sub>C</sub>-NiCoP catalyst lies between that of Ru foil and RuO2, suggesting that the average valence state of Ru atoms in the Ru<sub>C</sub> species is between 0 and 4.[10,44] This validates the robust immobilization of Ruc by its surrounding atoms and further indicates variations in chemical valence states for Ru atoms within the Ru<sub>C</sub> species. The EXAFS are plotted in Figure 3f. In the Ru<sub>SA</sub>-NiCoP spectrum, a prominent peak is observed at 1.47 Å, consistent with the position of the Ru-O bond observed in the RuO<sub>2</sub> spectrum. However, there is no discernible peak evident at 3.18 Å corresponding to the Ru–O–Ru bond in RuO<sub>2</sub>. These findings strongly support that surface-bound Ru atoms on Rusa-NiCoP nanosheets predominantly exist as isolate atoms. [9] The Ru<sub>C</sub>-NiCoP spectrum, in comparison, exhibits a distinct peak at 2.4 Å, which can be attributed to the presence of metallic Ru and is indicative of the formation of Ru clusters. Furthermore, the Ru<sub>c</sub>-NiCoP spectrum also shows an intense peak at 1.47 Å, indicating the robust anchoring effect of NiCoP supporter on Ru clusters. [44,45] Additionally, the coordination environment of Ru<sub>SA</sub> and Ruc was further clarified through wavelet transform (WT) analysis. As shown in Figure 2g, the Rusa -NiCoP exhibits an obvious contour intensity maximum at 5.4  $Å^{-1}$ , which aligns with the scattering path of Ru—O in RuO<sub>2</sub>. This observation indicates the presence of a Ru-O coordination structure between Ru<sub>SA</sub> species and NiCoP nanosheets, as well as an isolated dispersion state for the Ru<sub>SA</sub> species. In contrast, the Ru<sub>C</sub>-NiCoP displays a predominant contour intensity maximum at 8.9 Å<sup>-1</sup> and a secondary contour intensity at 5.4  $Å^{-1}$ , corresponding to scattering paths involving both Ru—Ru and Ru—O bonding respectively, suggesting the coexistence of both Ru-Ru and Ru-O coordination environment within the Ru<sub>C</sub> species.<sup>[52]</sup>

#### 2.2. Electrochemical Performance

The alkaline HER capability of the as-prepared catalysts was evaluated in a 1.0 м KOH solution saturated with Ar. Figure 3a presents the linear sweep voltammogram (LSV) curves, referenced to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), while Figure \$10a (Supporting Information) shows the corresponding data without IR compensation. The pristine NiCoP catalyst shows significantly inferior performance compared to commercial Pt/C and Ru/C. However, upon electrodeposition of Ru<sub>SA</sub> species onto the NiCoP surface, a remarkable enhancement in HER performance is observed for the resulting Ru<sub>SA</sub>-NiCoP. Furthermore, when Ru<sub>C</sub> species are electrodeposited onto NiCoP, an even more pronounced improvement in HER performance is achieved for the obtained Ru<sub>C</sub>-NiCoP compared to the Ru<sub>SA</sub>-NiCoP. These findings demonstrate that immobilization of either Ru<sub>C</sub> or Ru<sub>SA</sub> on NiCoP surfaces promotes alkaline HER activity and highlights that Ru<sub>C</sub> outperforms Ru<sub>SA</sub>. Specifically, as shown in Figure 3c, the Ru<sub>C</sub>-NiCoP requires ultralow overpotentials of 10, 66, and 207 mV to achieve  $\boldsymbol{H}_2$  evolution current densities  $(j_{\text{HER}})$  of 10, 100, and 600 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, respectively. These values are significantly lower than those observed for the Ru<sub>SA</sub>-NiCoP (16, 99, and 278 mV) and the commercial Pt/C (11, 79, and 290 mV). The

corresponding Tafel slope fitting data are illustrated in Figure 3b. Among all the tested catalysts, the  $Ru_C$ -NiCoP possesses the most favorable Tafel slope (39.5 mV dec $^{-1}$ ), leading to its highest rate of increase in  $j_{\rm HER}$  and suggesting that the Tafel step governs the overall reaction kinetics. Figure \$10b (Supporting Information) depicts the Nyquist plots, while Table \$1 (Supporting Information) presents the corresponding fitting data. Notably, compared to  $Ru_{\rm SA}$ -NiCoP (0.58  $\Omega$ ) and Pt/C (0.41  $\Omega$ ), the  $Ru_C$ -NiCoP (0.37  $\Omega$ ) displays a lower charge transfer resistance ( $R_{\rm ct}$ ), further highlighting its superior kinetic behavior for HER.  $^{[8]}$  Moreover, as presented in Figure 3d and Table \$2 (Supporting Information), the HER performance of the  $Ru_C$ -NiCoP surpasses that of nearly all previously reported transition metal-based catalysts and even

rivals many catalysts incorporating Ru clusters or Ru nanoparticles.

The electrocatalytic activity of  $Ru_C$ -NiCoP for HzOR was assessed using a three-electrode system in 1.0 m KOH containing  $N_2H_4$ . As depicted in Figure S11a (Supporting Information), the LSV results demonstrate that even at an extremely low concentration of  $N_2H_4$  (0.01 m),  $Ru_C$ -NiCoP exhibits remarkable HzOR performance. Moreover, it achieves optimal performance with increasing concentration of  $N_2H_4$  up to 0.2 m. Subsequently, all prepared catalysts were compared for their HzOR activity in a 1.0 m KOH electrolyte containing 0.2 m  $N_2H_4$ . The LSV results, with and without IR compensation, were displayed in Figure 3e and Figure S11b (Supporting Information), respectively. Despite the

superior HzOR activity exhibited by the NiCoP catalyst compared to Ru/C, Pt/C, and PFN, electrodeposited Ru<sub>C</sub> or Ru<sub>SA</sub> further enhances HzOR activity; with a more significant contribution from Ru<sub>C</sub>. Specifically, the Ru<sub>C</sub>-NiCoP (Figure S11c, Supporting Information) requires significantly lower working potentials of -89, -64, and -41 mV to achieve current densities of 100, 300, and 600 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> respectively compared to the Ru<sub>sa</sub>-NiCoP (-65, -12, and 47 mV) and NiCoP (-50, 7, and 75 mV). Furthermore, as shown in Figure 3f, the Tafel slope for the Ru<sub>C</sub>-NiCoP (9.6 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>) is significantly lower than that of the Ru<sub>SA</sub>-NiCoP (31.4 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>) and NiCoP (39.3 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>), indicating that the electrodeposition of Ru<sub>C</sub> facilitates enhanced catalytic kinetics for HzOR. The charge transfer resistance (R<sub>ct</sub>) values for HzOR of all prepared catalysts were obtained by fitting Nyquist plots shown in Figure S11d (Supporting Information) using an equivalent circuit mode with R(QR). The Ru<sub>C</sub>-NiCoP possesses a significantly lower  $R_{ct}$  value of 0.1  $\Omega$  (Table S3, Supporting Information) compared to the Ru<sub>SA</sub>-NiCoP (0.22  $\Omega$ ) and NiCoP (0.26  $\Omega$ ), suggesting that electrodeposited Ru<sub>C</sub> is more efficient in facilitating electron transfer at the catalyst-electrolyte interface. Moreover, the synthesized Ru<sub>C</sub>-NiCoP catalyst in our study exhibits superior HzOR performance compared to the majority of previously reported findings, as shown in Figure 3g and Table S4 (Supporting Information).

In addition, to further understand the impact of electrodeposited Ru<sub>C</sub> and Ru<sub>SA</sub> on the intrinsic activity for HER and HzOR, we compared the electrochemical surface area (ECSA) of Ru<sub>C</sub>-NiCoP, Ru<sub>SA</sub>-NiCoP, and NiCoP through evaluating their electrochemical double-layer capacitance (C<sub>dl</sub>), which was determined by analyzing the cyclic voltammetry curves at non-faradic potential using varying scan rates (Figure S12, Supporting Information). After electrodeposition of Ru<sub>C</sub> or Ru<sub>SA</sub>, the C<sub>dl</sub> value increases to 16.43 mF cm $^{-2}$  for the Ru<sub>C</sub>-NiCoP and 14.73 mF cm<sup>-2</sup> for the Ru<sub>SA</sub>-NiCoP, compared to 11.45 mF cm<sup>-2</sup> for the NiCoP, indicating an augmentation in active sites and intrinsic activity facilitated by immobilized Ru<sub>C</sub> or Ru<sub>SA</sub>. [7] Furthermore, according to the ECSA normalized LSV curves of HER and HzOR (Figure S12e,f, Supporting Information), it can be inferred that Ru<sub>C</sub> contributes more to the intrinsic activity toward HER and HzOR compared to  $Ru_{SA}$ , particularly for HzOR.

The chronopotentiometry test was employed to assess the long-term durability of Ru<sub>C</sub>-NiCoP and Ru<sub>SA</sub>-NiCoP for HER and HzOR at working current densities of -100 and 100 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, respectively, over 80 h. As shown in Figure 3h, after continuous operation for 80 h, both Ru<sub>C</sub>-NiCoP and Ru<sub>SA</sub>-NiCoP demonstrate a slight increase in HER working potential, indicating their exceptional robust stability during alkaline HER. On the other hand, compared to Ru<sub>SA</sub>-NiCoP, the working potential increase for HzOR is significantly lower in the case of Ru<sub>C</sub>-NiCoP, indicating its superior stability during prolonged HzOR. Figures \$13-\$16 (Supporting Information) present the SEM images of Rusa-NiCoP and Ruc-NiCoP after durability tests for HER or HzOR, respectively. Despite undergoing obvious nanoscale surface reconstruction, both Ru<sub>SA</sub>-NiCoP and Ru<sub>C</sub>-NiCoP still maintain a well-preserved 3D porous structure at the micrometer level, ensuring their long-term stability in alkaline HER. In comparison with the alkaline HER, prolonged HzOR results in more pronounced nanoscale surface reconstructions on both Ru<sub>SA</sub>-NiCoP and Ru<sub>C</sub>-NiCoP. This worsened reconstruction phenomenon during HzOR is likely induced by the redox cyclic reactions between the oxidation behavior of the catalysts under a relatively high working potential and the reducing action resulting from the strong chemical reducibility of N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> molecules.<sup>[7]</sup> The surface of Ru<sub>SA</sub>-NiCoP underwent substantial restructuring, resulting in the obstruction of its 3D porous structure, concealment of active sites, and a reduction in electrochemical surface area, as depicted in Figure S15 (Supporting Information). Consequently, this leads to a decline in its HzOR performance. Surprisingly, despite evident nanoscale surface reconstruction observed for the Ru<sub>C</sub>-NiCoP (Figure S16, Supporting Information), it effectively maintains its 3D porous structure at the micrometer level. The comparative result underscores the advantageous impact of electrodeposited of Ruc on the long-term HzOR stability. Additionally, Ru-Kedge XANES spectra, corresponding Ru-K-edge in R-spacing, and Wavelet transform graphs of Ru<sub>C</sub>-NiCoP are shown in Figure \$17 (Supporting Information). No discernible variations in chemical valence state and coordination structure are observed, thus confirming the robust stability of Ru<sub>C</sub> species during HER and HzOR.

To assess the potential application of the  $Ru_C\text{-NiCoP}$  catalyst for energy-conservation  $H_2$  production, a single-chamber electrolyzer (SEC) was constructed with two  $Ru_C\text{-NiCoP}$  electrodes serving as the anode and cathode, respectively. The SEC was filled with either a 1.0  $\,\mathrm{m}$  KOH solution or a 1.0  $\,\mathrm{m}$  KOH containing 0.2  $\,\mathrm{m}$   $N_2H_4$  for OWS or HzAWS, respectively. Figure 3i compares the polarization curves without IR compensation between HzAWS and OWS. On the LSV curve of HzAWS, a significant reduction in cell voltage by 1.69 and 1.77 V is observed compared to that of OWS at  $H_2$  evolution current densities of 100 and 300 mA cm $^{-2}$ , respectively, indicating substantial savings in electric energy.

#### 2.3. Mechanism Investigation

DFT calculations were conducted to gain deeper insights into the mechanism underlying the enhancement of both HER and HzOR activity induced by electrodeposited Ru<sub>C</sub> or Ru<sub>SA</sub>, as well as to elucidate the reasons for the superior contribution of Ru<sub>C</sub> compared to Ru<sub>SA</sub>. The optimized structure models of NiCoP, Ru<sub>SA</sub>-NiCoP, and Ru<sub>C</sub>-NiCoP catalysts, along with their corresponding Bader charge analysis results, are depicted in Figure 4a. In the Ru<sub>SA</sub>-NiCoP model, the Ru atom exhibits an electrondeficient state, indicating charge transfer from the Ru atom to the NiCoP support. [9] Consequently, this leads to a transition of Bader charge values toward a neutral state for certain adjacent Co, Ni, and P atoms surrounding Ru<sub>SA</sub>. In the case of the Ru<sub>C</sub>-NiCoP model, an enhanced charge transmission from interfacial Ru atoms within the Ru<sub>C</sub> species to the NiCoP support results in a deviation in Bader charge value for a greater number of surrounding Co, Ni, and P atoms adjacent to the Ru<sub>C</sub>. Importantly, the Ruton within Ruc species displays a state of charge enrichment, indicating the formation of novel active sites. These findings suggest that the electrodeposited Ru<sub>C</sub> arouses a more pronounced modulation effect on the surface charge distribution of NiCoP supporter, in comparison to Ru<sub>SA</sub>. Moreover, as shown in Figure 4b, the electrodeposited Ru<sub>C</sub> leads to a more significant enhancement of the continuity of the density of states (DOS) near

the Fermi level compared to RuSA. The improved DOS continuity facilitates surface electron migration and reduces Rct for electrocatalytic reaction, thereby accelerating reaction kinetics.[\[53–55\]](#page-10-0)

In alkaline HER, the adsorption of H2O molecules on the catalyst surface and subsequent desorption of H\* intermediates play a pivotal role.[\[16,56\]](#page-10-0) Figure 4c illustrates the optimized adsorption energies of H2O molecules on these three models while their corresponding adsorption structure models are presented in Figure S18a (Supporting Information). Compared to NiCoP (−0.53 eV), both RuC-NiCoP and RuSA-NiCoP demonstrate increased water adsorption energies of −0.98 and −0.68 eV, respectively, indicating their enhanced affinity toward H2O molecules, particularly the RuC-NiCoP. Figure 4d presents the Gibbs free energy of the H\* intermediate adsorption/desorption (ΔGH\*) on the optimized active sites of these three catalyst models (Figure S18b, Supporting Information). It is evident that NiCoP exhibits a strong affinity toward the H\* intermediate, impeding its desorption along with H2 formation, resulting in sluggish HER kinetics. In comparison, the much negative d-band center (d) of the RuC-NiCoP (−1.722 eV), induced by RuC electrodeposition, compared to the RuSA-NiCoP (−1.641 eV) and NiCoP (−1.662 eV) implies a higher occupancy of antibonding states and a more favorable environment for the adsorption and desorption for the H\* intermediates,[\[57\]](#page-10-0) thereby resulting in a more thermoneutral ΔGH\* (−0.21 eV) and accelerating the kinetics of HER.

For HzOR, the adsorption energies of the N2H4 molecule on optimized sites of these three catalysts are compared in Figure 4e,

while the corresponding adsorption structure models are presented in Figure S19 (Supporting Information). Remarkably, the Ruton site of Ruc-NiCoP (-0.77 eV) exhibits a significantly enhanced adsorption energy for the N2H4 molecule compared to Ru<sub>SA</sub>-NiCoP (−0.395 eV) and NiCoP (−0.449 eV), underscoring its exceptional suitability as the optimal active site for HzOR. Figure 4f illustrates the calculated free energies of adsorbed intermediates and dehydrogenation steps on NiCoP, Rusa-NiCoP, and Ru<sub>C</sub>-NiCoP surfaces. On the NiCoP surface, both dehydrogenation steps from  $N_2H_4$  to  $N_2H_3$  and from  $N_2H_3$  to  $N_2H_2$  are thermodynamically endothermic with energy barriers of 0.035 and 0.786 eV, respectively, indicating that the rate-determining step is the dehydrogenation from \*N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub> to \*N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub>.<sup>[56]</sup> In comparison, on the Rusa-NiCoP surface, the dehydrogenation step from \*N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> to \*N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub> becomes a spontaneous thermodynamic exothermic reaction, and the conversion from \*N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub> to \*N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> (0.537 eV) exhibits a reduced energy barrier. Moreover, the energy barrier for this rate-determining dehydrogenation step on the Ru<sub>C</sub>-NiCoP surface further declines to 0.495 eV, indicating significantly enhanced dehydrogenation kinetics compared to that of the Rusa-NiCoP. Consequently, the enhanced adsorption energy for N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> molecules, coupled with the decreased energy barrier of the rate-determining dehydrogenation step, contributes to the superior HzOR performance on the Ru<sub>C</sub>-NiCoP catalyst. In summary, Ru<sub>C</sub> outperforms Ru<sub>SA</sub> in enhancing the bifunctional electrocatalytic activities for HER and HzOR.

## 2.4. DHzFC and Self-Powered $\rm H_2$ Production System Performance

In view of the excellent electrocatalytic activity and remarkably low oxidation potential exhibited by the Ru<sub>C</sub>-NiCoP and Ru<sub>SA</sub>-NiCoP for HzOR, a custom-designed DHzFC was assembled employing either a Ru<sub>C</sub>-NiCoP or Ru<sub>SA</sub>-NiCoP anode for HzOR while utilizing a commercial Pt/C cathode for O<sub>2</sub> reduction. A 1.0 м KOH containing varying concentrations of  $N_2H_4$  was directed through the anode passageway at 60 ml min<sup>-1</sup>, whereas moistened O2 flowed through the cathode track at 50 standard cubic centimeters per minute. The constructed DHzFCs operated under ambient temperature conditions. The discharge polarization curves, along with their corresponding peak power densities, are shown in Figure 5a-c. Notably, the DHzFC equipped with a Ru<sub>C</sub>-NiCoP anode achieves prominent peak power densities of 226, 239, and 255 mW cm<sup>-2</sup> at N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> concentrations of 0.2, 0.4, and 0.6 м, respectively, representing a significant improvement of approximately 35-45% compared to the DHzFC equipped with a Ru<sub>SA</sub>-NiCoP anode; thus highlighting the superior performance offered by using the Ru<sub>C</sub>-NiCoP as the anode in DHzFC. The continuous discharge capability of the as-prepared DHzFCs was evaluated at 100 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> through a chronopotentiometry test (Figure 5d). After an uninterrupted power generation period of 15 h, the output voltages show a marginal decline of 69 or 92 mV when utilizing  $Ru_{C}\mbox{-NiCoP}$  or  $Ru_{SA}\mbox{-NiCoP}$  catalyst as anode, respectively, suggesting the superior robust stability of the Ru<sub>C</sub>-NiCoP as the anode in DHzFC.

Considering the excellent bifunctional electrocatalytic activity of the  $Ru_C$ -NiCoP catalyst for both HER and HzOR, we constructed a flow cell electrolyzer (FCE) equipped with two 1.0 cm<sup>2</sup>

pieces of Ru<sub>C</sub>-NiCoP electrodes as both anode and cathode to evaluate its potential application for energy-saving H<sub>2</sub> generation. As depicted in Figure 5e,f, the FCE only requires cell voltages of 0.07, 0.51, and 1.0 V to achieve H<sub>2</sub> evolution current densities of 100, 500, and 900 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> with 0.2 m N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>. Furthermore, an increase in N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> concentration results in a slight discrepancy in the H<sub>2</sub> evolution current value at cell voltages below 0.5 V, while a significant disparity is observed at relatively higher cell voltages, indicating the outstanding electrochemical oxidation efficiency of N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> at the anode.

Building upon the impressive performance of the assembled DHzFCs and the exceptionally low driving potential of HzAWS reaction, a self-powered H<sub>2</sub> production system can be readily accomplished by employing a DHzFC as a power source to drive a HzAWS electrolyzer. The DHzFC-HEC system is constructed by integrating a DHzFC with a H-type double-chamber electrolytic cell (HEC). As shown in Figures \$20 and \$21 (Supporting Information), the loop current value was determined to be only 34.9 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> when utilizing a Ru<sub>SA</sub>-NiCoP anode due to the high solution resistance in the HEC, whereas it increased to 44.9 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> when employing a Ru<sub>C</sub>-NiCoP anode. Moreover, the generated H<sub>2</sub> from the cathode of the HEC device was collected using the water drainage method, yielding  $\approx$ 16 and 20.6 ml cm<sup>-2</sup> h<sup>-1</sup> when employing Ru<sub>SA</sub>-NiCoP and Ru<sub>C</sub>-NiCoP anode respectively. Consequently, the Ru<sub>C</sub>-NiCoP catalyst significantly enhances the  $H_2$  generation rate in the self-powered  $H_2$  production system. To further evaluate the practical application potential of the selfpowered H<sub>2</sub> generation system, we assembled a DHzFC-FEC system by connecting a DHzFC with a FEC in series, as depicted in Figure 5g and Figure S22 (Supporting Information). The anode of the DHzFC and both electrodes of the FEC were equipped with the Ru<sub>c</sub>-NiCoP catalysts. Due to the significantly lower solution resistance in the FEC compared to that in the HEC, we acquired a substantial increase in measured H2 production current values, reaching 154 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> at anode electrolyte concentration of 0.2 м N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>. Furthermore, we collected generated H<sub>2</sub> from the cathode of the FEC using a water drainage method (Figures \$23 and \$24, Supporting Information; Figure 5h). Remarkably high H<sub>2</sub> yield rates were achieved, measuring at 4.9 mmol cm<sup>-2</sup> h<sup>-1</sup>  $(120 \text{ mL cm}^{-2} \text{ h}^{-1})$  and 5.7 mmol cm<sup>-2</sup> h<sup>-1</sup>  $(140 \text{ mL cm}^{-2} \text{ h}^{-1})$ when flowing an anode electrolyte containing 0.2 or 0.4 M  $N_2H_4$ through the FEC, respectively, surpassing most recently reported findings (Figure 5i; Table S5, Supporting Information).

#### 3. Conclusion

In conclusion,  $Ru_C$  exhibits superior to  $Ru_{SA}$  in improving HER and HzOR bifunctional electrocatalytic activity of NiCoP catalyst. Specifically, the  $Ru_C$ -NiCoP requires ultralow overpotentials of 10 and 207 mV to achieve 10 and 600 mA cm $^{-2}$  for alkaline HER, respectively. Moreover, it achieves 100 and 600 mA cm $^{-2}$  at exceptionally low working potentials of -89 and -41 mV for HzOR, respectively. Compared to OWS, the HzAWS employing a  $Ru_C$ -NiCoP anode exhibits a remarkable cell voltage drop of 1.77 V at 300 mA cm $^{-2}$ , showcasing its exceptional efficiency in energy-saving  $H_2$  production. DFT calculations unveil the superior ability of  $Ru_C$  in modulating surface charge distribution and reducing  $R_{ct}$  of HER and HzOR. Furthermore, these calculations elucidate that  $Ru_C$  outperforms  $Ru_{SA}$  in enhancing

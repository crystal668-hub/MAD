# **Co–N–C/C Bifunctional Electrocatalyst for Dual Applications in Seawater Electrolysis and Catalyst in Hydrazine Fuel Cells**

*Snehanjali Behera,\* Chetansinh Chauhan, and Biswajit Mondal\**

**The convergence of water electrolysis and alkaline fuel cells offers captivating solutions for sustainably harvesting energy. The research explores both hydrazine-assisted seawater electrolysis (hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) and hydrogen production reaction (HER)), as well as alkaline hydrazine fuel cell reactions (HzOR and Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR)) by using a bifunctional cobalt polyaniline derived (Co PANI/C) catalyst. The catalyst shows excellent performance for hydrazine-assisted seawater electrolysis in harsh seawater environments to produce H2 as fuel with nearly 85% Faradaic efficiency and during alkaline HzOR, the bifunctional catalyst generates H2 with 95% Faradaic efficiency by acting as both anode and cathode side catalyst. Also, the same catalyst requires only a potential of 0.34 V versus RHE and 0.906 V versus RHE for HzOR and ORR, respectively, in 1 m KOH, which makes this overall process useful for a Hz/O2 fuel cell.**

## **1. Introduction**

Global energy demand and fossil fuel-generated pollution have set thrives for renewable and clean energy. H2 fuel can be considered as an alternative green energy source. Currently, industries follow steam reforming and coal gasification processes for largescale H2 production, which eventually generates CO2, a greenhouse gas.[\[1\]](#page-5-0) Therefore, small-scale production of H2 fuel by electrochemical water splitting can be considered as an alternative defensible strategy. Out of the two crucial reactions involved here HER and OER, the latter suffers from torpid kinetics and higher overpotential requirement.[\[2\]](#page-5-0) The OER one can be replaced by different substrate oxidation reactions like HMF, urea, etc. to enhance the overall hydrogen production rate.[\[3,4\]](#page-5-0) Alternatively, hydrazine a non-carbon-based high-energy content small molecule can be used as a replacement for OER owing to its ultra-low standard potential (*E*<sup>0</sup> N2H4/N2 = −0.33 V), which ultimately facilitates the H2 production kinetics.[\[5,6\]](#page-5-0) Again, hydrazine-assisted seawater electrolysis affords a huge abundant source of energy without any reliance on limited freshwater resources. Seawater often contains high chloride concentration and during

anodic oxidation, it releases toxic and corrosive species like Cl2, ClO<sup>−</sup> which ultimately leads to a shorter life span of the anode and hence affects the efficiency and sustainability of the electrochemical cell. Hydrazineassisted seawater electrolysis provides the most favorable way to overcome the challenging, competitive chlorine oxidation reaction (ClOR) and suppresses ClOR due to its lesser standard potential compared to ClOR (1.7 V).[\[7\]](#page-5-0) Hydrazine can also be considered a high-energy-carrying liquid fuel.[\[2\]](#page-5-0) To proficiently extract the stored chemical energy, hydrazine fuel cells can be employed. The products formed (N2, H2O) in the fuel cell reactions are neither hazardous nor carbon-containing. The theoretical standard equilibrium hydrazine cell potential is 1.56 V (Equation (3)) which

is superior to conventional hydrogen fuel cell, whose theoretical standard equilibrium potential is 1.23 V.[\[8\]](#page-5-0) This electrochemical method will also help in faster hydrazine elimination from industrial manure without any hazardous oxidant requirement. Therefore, hydrazine fuel will help maximize the energy output and cost-effectiveness of the alkaline hydrazine fuel cell for future environmental sustainability.

So far platinum has been reported as the best catalyst for HzOR, HER, ORR. Mostly expensive metal-based electrocatalysts like Pd, Au, and Ag have also been utilized for the purpose as they work at lesser overpotential which hinders their further application in real-life fuel cells (**Figure [1](#page-1-0)**).[\[9–19\]](#page-5-0)

There have been enduring efforts going on to design nonnoble metal catalysts for alkaline hydrazine fuel cells. Where the anodic reaction is HzOR and the cathodic reaction is ORR. M-N-C (M = Fe, Co) catalysts are well-known for cathodic ORR due to their greater stability, high active surface area, and good conductivity.[\[20–27\]](#page-6-0) Additionally, a few Co-based M-N-C catalysts

as well as atomically dispersed SeC4 catalysts have also been reported for alkaline HzOR.[\[28–30\]](#page-6-0) Recently, we have reported Fe-PANI/C as an efficient catalyst for electrochemical and aerobic N-N bond formation.[\[31\]](#page-6-0) Combining cobalt with other non-noble transition metal catalysts like CoNiP@ N-doped, Fe-Co oxide, and Co-doped MnPSe3 has resulted in promising activity in seawater electrolysis.[\[32–35\]](#page-6-0) Cobalt has also proved its efficacy as a bifunctional catalyst for hydrazine-assisted seawater electrolysis.[\[36\]](#page-6-0) Also, multi-metallic nanoalloys like Nickel/molybdenum or tungsten have also shown high efficiency for overall hydrazineassisted seawater splitting.[\[37\]](#page-6-0)

In this study, we report an energy-saving i) hydrazine-assisted alkaline seawater electrolysis, HzOR/HER to promote faster H2 production ii) HzOR/ORR in an alkaline medium for applications in hydrazine fuel cell using a bifunctional M-N-C/C catalyst, Co PANI/C. Co PANI/C is a very good catalyst for acidic ORR. It is demonstrated that the ORR with Co PANI/C is equally good in an alkaline medium in terms of overpotential. Also, HzOR has a different pH-dependence slope at the alkaline region (Figure 1b) with Co PANI/C. Together both reactions can be effectively done in an alkaline medium with Co PANI/C as a catalyst making it a suitable candidate for bifunctional catalysts in alkaline hydrazine fuel cells. Thus, this study will be eventually helpful in exploring the existing state-of-the-art ORR catalysts for electrocatalytic HzOR and HER.

# **2. Results and Discussion**

The Co PANI/C was synthesized by following a reported synthesis procedure,[\[38\]](#page-6-0) where the Co metal was incorporated in a nitrogen-doped carbon structure prepared by polymerization of aniline precursor for carbon, nitrogen backbone. For metalation (CH3COO)2 Co. 4H2O was added by annealing at 850 °C followed by acid wash. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results (**Figure 2**[a,b;](#page-2-0) Figure S18, Supporting Information) revealed the chemical state of doped N and Co elements in the Co PANI/C catalyst. The Co 2p3/2 peaks of the Co PANI/C material are located at 781.69 and 779.46 eV, confirming the existence of Co2+ and Co3O4 in the catalyst structure.[\[39\]](#page-6-0) The N 1s XPS spectrum comprises three different peaks at 399 eV, 400.5 eV can be assigned to pyridinic-N, and pyrrolic-N, respectively, and the peak at 404.7 eV is for the terminal N─O bonding. The O 1s spectrum contains two different regions at 533.4 eV for surface-bound water or OH at 530.8 due to Co─O.[\[40\]](#page-6-0) The surface morphology was determined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), which suggests having a typical polymer-like feature with an irregular granular structure. The presence of all the elements Co, N, and C was further confirmed from energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) (Figure [2c;](#page-2-0) Figure S1, Supporting Information). Also, the PXRD of the as-prepared sample confirms the crystallinity of the sample. A broad peak at 24.8° arises due to the [0 0 2] hexagonal plane of graphite and a weak diffraction at 43.8° is observed, for the [1 0 0] plane of graphitic sheet structure resulting from the pyrolysis of polyaniline. The peak of ≈30° (29.9°) is due to some phase transfer of carbon during pyrolysis at higher temperatures (46–0945). Further, two weak peaks at 31.2° and 36.7° presumably arise due to the presence of small amount of Co3O4, and peaks at 44.4° and 52.0° arise due to the incorporation of Cobalt in the N─C/C structure (Figure [2d\)](#page-2-0).[\[41–43\]](#page-6-0) The TEM images (Figure S2, Supporting Information) suggest crystalline PANI layered-globular structures for Co PANI/C. The HAADF-STEM mapping shows the presence of all elements C, N, Co, and O.

The electrochemical HzOR in 1 m KOH with the optimized Co PANI/C catalyst (Co2.625) deposited on a glassy carbon electrode shows an early catalytic onset potential at 0.34 V versus RHE (**Figure 3**[a;](#page-3-0) Figure S3, Supporting Information) reaching a peak having a current density of ≈12 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> at ≈0.65 V. Co2.625, among the other Co PANI/C catalysts prepared with different Co content shows the best electrocatalytic HzOR and hence further studies are performed with this sample. Please note that the hydrazine oxidation process produces N2 bubbles, which cause spikes in the CV as it disrupts the electrochemical circuit.[\[44\]](#page-6-0) The turnover frequency (TOF) at 0.45 V versus RHE is calculated to be 0.057 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>3</sup> s<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> using Equation S4 (Supporting Information). The Tafel slope at the kinetic region is determined to be 150 mV dec<sup>−</sup>1, suggesting a single electron transfer (Equation S8, Supporting Information) in the rate-determining step (RDS) (Figure [3b\)](#page-3-0). The catalytic current at 0.45 V versus RHE increases steadily with increasing hydrazine concentration from

<span id="page-2-0"></span>**Figure 2.** Characterization of Co PANI/C: a,b) XPS spectra of N, Co in Co PANI/C, respectively, c) SEM image, and d) XRD of the synthesized sample Co PANI/C.

0 to 60 mm and then slowly tends to reach saturation. When the catalytic current density is plotted against the concentration of hydrazine, a linear plot is obtained suggesting a first-order dependence of kinetics with respect to hydrazine concentration (Figure [3c;](#page-3-0) Figure S4, Supporting Information). The catalytic onset potential shows a gradual cathodic shift with increasing pH and when *E*onset is plotted against pH, two distinct pH-dependent regions are obtained: one having slope of 30 mV pH<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> in the pH range 7–10 indicates a 1H<sup>+</sup>/ 2e<sup>−</sup> process, and for pH 11– 14 a slope of ≈105 mV pH<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> suggests a 2H<sup>+</sup>/ 1e<sup>−</sup> pathway in the potential determining step (Figure [3d;](#page-3-0) Figure S5, Supporting Information).

The electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) of the catalyst after deposition on a glassy carbon electrode was determined from Cdl measurement by plotting current density at the non-Faradaic region with varying scan rates ranging from 10 to 100 mV s<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> and was found to be 310.17 cm<sup>2</sup> (**Figure 4**[a;](#page-4-0) Figure S6 and Equation S3, Supporting Information). The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (ESI) was recorded under an N2 atmosphere with a frequency range of 0.1–105 Hz and an amplitude of 0.01 at 0.475 V versus RHE. This revealed a lesser charge transfer resistance of 13.9 Ohm (Rct) after the addition of hydrazine but nearly unchanged solvent resistance (Rs) of 6 Ohm after the addition of hydrazine (Figure [4b\)](#page-4-0). It means that hydrazine addition enhances the charge transfer kinetics. Further to explore the long-term durability of the catalyst, the catalyst was dropcasted on a 1 × 1 cm<sup>2</sup> carbon cloth electrode. The microanalysis of the asdeposited electrode was examined by SEM and EDS. The irregular granular, flake-like structure was observed with a uniform distribution of all the elements (Figure S7, Supporting Information). For Faradaic efficiency determination, constant current electrolysis at 5 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> was performed at least for 10 h with seawater having hydrazine (Figure [4c\)](#page-4-0). Again, this is particularly essential for seawater electrolysis where the water contains a considerable amount of chloride, and chloride oxidation to chlorate species can compete with the OER causing anode corrosion and decreased efficiency in terms of long-term operation and Faradaic yield. Thus, Hz-assisted water splitting to afford hydrogen from seawater is an economically viable option that addresses all the challenges discussed earlier. The catalyst was stable throughout with a slight increase in potential of 100 mV. This may be partially attributed to substrate (Hz) consumption. The Faradaic efficiency was calculated to be 85% for N2 and H2 (the reaction product at the counter electrode) (Figure [4d;](#page-4-0) Figure S8, Supporting Information). Additionally, the surface SEM reveals the surface morphology was retained even after the electrolysis experiment with the uniform distribution of each element (Co, N, C) (Figure S9, Supporting Information) as confirmed by EDS. Although there are catalysts reported for electrochemical HzOR to assist water splitting, for cathodic reaction, Pt is used to produce hydrogen

<span id="page-3-0"></span>**Figure 3.** Electrochemical hydrazine oxidation (HzOR): a) CV of 100 mm hydrazine oxidation in 1 m KOH, b) Tafel plot of HzOR measured in the kinetic region, c) Plot of HzOR catalytic current density versus concentration of Hydrazine, and d) *E* versus pH plot.

which makes the overall process cost ineffective. Thus, a catalyst needs to be developed that can perform alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) as well so that Hz-assisted seawater electrolysis can be made easy in operation with economic viability. Thus, to test the HER activity of the catalyst, electrocatalysis is performed in 1 m KOH, where the HzOR activity is maximum with the same catalyst. The catalyst shows an onset potential of 200 mV with a Tafel slope of 140 mV dec<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> implying one electron transfer in the rate-limiting step. The EIS was measured keeping all parameters the same as in the case of HzOR and a charge transfer resistance of 4.26 Ohm is observed suggesting a facile charge transfer kinetics at the electrode-electrolyte interface (Figure S10, Supporting Information). The HER activity remains unchanged in the presence of hydrazine (Figure S11, Supporting Information). Encouraged by the results from both cathodic HER and anodic HzOR half-reactions individually in 1 m KOH, electrolysis with Co PANI/C as both anode and cathode side catalyst for Hz-assisted water splitting was accessed in 1 m KOH replacing Pt as a counter electrode. The catalyst was found to be stable for *>*8 h with a slight increase in potential of ≈100 mV at constant current electrolysis of 5 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> (Figure S12a, Supporting Information). Product analysis and quantification during electrolysis revealed the formation of N2 and H2 with a Faradaic efficiency of 95% (Figure S12b, Supporting Information). Thus, Co PANI/C is demonstrated to be a bifunctional catalyst for alkaline HER and HzOR and taken together Hz-assisted water splitting can be enabled with this. Using Co PANI/C as both the cathode and anode, a constant current seawater electrolysis was also performed for 8

h. Based on the time-dependent GC experiment, the Faradaic efficiency was found to be 87% for N2 and 93% for H2 production (Figure S13, Supporting Information).

As the Co PANI/C is found to be active for HzOR with considerably lower onset potential, it can be a good catalyst for Hzfuel cells where the anodic reaction is HzOR and the cathodic reaction is the ORR. M─N─C (M═Fe, Co) catalysts are already reported as good ORR catalysts. Co PANI/C also shows good activity for ORR with a low onset potential of 0.906 V versus RHE and 0.929 V versus RHE in 1 m KOH and 0.1 m KOH, respectively (**Figure 5**[a;](#page-5-0) Figure S14a, Supporting Information). From rotating disk electrochemistry (RDE), the product selectivity of Co PANI/C toward 4H<sup>+</sup>/4e<sup>−</sup> reduction of O2 to H2O was investigated. The no. of electrons involved here was calculated to be 4 for 1 m KOH and 3.18 for 0.1 m KOH from the slope of the Koutecky– Levich equation (K–L plot) using the Equation S5 (Supporting Information) at potential 0.6 and 0.64 V versus RHE, respectively (Figure [5b;](#page-5-0) Figure S14b, Supporting Information). The results obtained from RDE were also in good agreement with the rotating ring–disk electrochemistry (RRDE) data. The %H2O2 and no. of electrons involved were revealed from RRDE using Equations S6 and S7 (Supporting Information) to be 9.82% and 3.87 for 1 m KOH and 9.59% and 3.85 for 0.1 m KOH at potential 0.57 and 0.61 V versus RHE, respectively (Figure [5c;](#page-5-0) Figure S14c, Supporting Information). The n value remains close to 4 against a range of potential (Figure S15, Supporting Information). This suggests a direct 4 electron pathway is involved in the ORR process with higher energy conversion efficiency. When the *E*

versus pH graph was plotted by taking the potentials at the onset, it follows proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) with 1 H<sup>+</sup>/ 1 e<sup>−</sup> in the potential determining step with a near Nernstian slope of 50 mV pH<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> (Figure [5d;](#page-5-0) Figure S16a, Supporting Information). The EIS was measured under an N2 atmosphere as well as in an O2-saturated environment with a frequency range of 0.1– 10[\[5\]](#page-5-0) Hz and amplitude of 0.01 at a potential of 0.723 V versus RHE. During ORR, the charge transfer kinetics becomes faster at the electrode-electrolyte interface and becomes only 1.41 Ohm, an order of magnitude lesser compared to in the N2 atmosphere (Figure S16b, Supporting Information). The downward slope of the ORR LSV curves is due to the charging current in the background as seen in Figure S17 (Supporting Information).[\[45,46\]](#page-6-0)

The activity of the Co PANI/C was compared with the activity of Pt/C for HzOR, ORR and HER (Figures S19 and S20, Supporting Information). The onset for HzOR by Pt/C is at 0.188 V whereas, for Co PANI/C is at 0.341 V versus RHE with a potential difference of 153 mV. Similarly for ORR, the onset for Pt/C is at 0.936 V versus RHE, and for Co PANI/C is at 0.929 V versus RHE with a potential difference of 70 mV. For HER, the onset for Co PANI/C starts at −0.033 V versus RHE whereas, the onset for Co PANI/C is at −0.205 V versus RHE with a potential difference of 172 mV.

Thus, a combination of HzOR anode and ORR cathode operative under alkaline conditions can be constructed to afford a Hz/O2 fuel cell. The Hz/O2 fuel cell should theoretically yield 1.56 V. considering the overpotential requirement for HzOR (≈670 mV) and ORR (324 mV), with Co PANI/C catalyst a maximum of 0.566 V can be obtained. As there is a lack of inexpensive catalysts for anode side hydrogen oxidation in a conventional H2/O2 fuel cell, Hz/O2 fuel cell constructed with Co PANI/C as a bifunctional catalyst could be an impressive alternative.

## **3. Conclusion**

In conclusion, the hydrazine-assisted alkaline seawater electrolysis with a polyaniline-based Co PANI/C as a bifunctional catalyst was successfully explored with efficacious generation of chlorinefree energy saving hydrogen fuel with nearly 85% Faradaic yield. Also, the promising activity of the catalyst was expolored during HzOR/ HER in 1 m KOH as well as in 1 m seawater KOH, where the Faradaic efficiencies for H2 production was nearly 95% and 93%, respectively with stability for *>*8 h. Again, the durability and bifunctionality of the same catalyst were investigated for applications related to alkaline hydrazine fuel cells. In terms of catalytic onset for HzOR, the catalyst shows comparable activity whereas, for alkaline ORR, it displays outstanding performance (Tables S1–S4, Supporting Information).[47-54] The study shows the promise of Co PANI/ C as a multifunctional catalyst that may enable the use of hydrazine as a high-energy carrier for hydrogen fuel production from seawater as well as power generation via alkaline fuel cells to fulfill the ongoing energy demand for future applications.

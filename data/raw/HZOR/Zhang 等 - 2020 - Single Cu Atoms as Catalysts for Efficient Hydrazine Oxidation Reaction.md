**Abstract:** The development of cost-effective electrocatalysts is vital for promoting the practical application of hydrazine as a viable energy carrier. However, the catalytic performance of the singleatom Cu catalyst has not been evaluated with regard to the hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR). Herein, single Cu atoms anchored on the surface of the P-doped C3N<sup>4</sup> substrate (Cu-SA/PCN) have been synthesized using a simple method that involved pyrolysis and phosphorization. The as-obtained Cu-SA/PCN catalyst is observed to demonstrate a suitable efficiency for the electrocatalytic hydrazine oxidation at the anode in an alkaline aqueous solution. Remarkably, the catalyst exhibits an excellent electrolytic activity and strong durability for 30 h. Further, it displays a current density of 100 mA cm-2 at a low applied potential of 0.336 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode. Therefore, this study provides a strategy to manufacture single atom catalysts for an efficient HzOR in alkaline media.

#### **Introduction**

The use of electrochemical water splitting to produce hydrogen has received widespread attention for manufacturing clean energy carriers; however, this technique necessitates a significant consumption of expensive electrical energy, which has limited its use.[1,2] The hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) can replace the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) to achieve a more energy-efficient electrolytic hydrogen production; this is because it has a significantly lower standard potential than that of OER.[3–8] Therefore, there is a need to develop a catalyst that effectively reduces the reaction potential of HzOR.

Cu-based catalysts have attracted significant attention due to their high conductivities, low costs, and great catalytic activities.[9–17] The nano-sized Cu-based catalyst even showed a better catalytic performance than that of Pt/C.[7, 10-11] Single-atom metal catalysts exhibit high atom utilization efficiencies, unique electronic structures, and excellent catalytic performances. [18–23] Therefore, the single-atom Cu catalyst is used in various reactions, such as CO oxidation,[24] oxygen reduction,[25] and carbon dioxide reduction. [26,27] Therefore, when the size of Cu is reduced from the nanoscale to the atomic level (single-atom Cu catalyst), the electronic state of the Cu atoms will appear,[28] giving unique properties for HzOR. However, this catalyst has not been applied to HzOR thus far.

C3N<sup>4</sup> exhibits a conjugated network structure with the highest nitrogen content. It is covalently bonded between carbon and nitrogen via a π-conjugated structure,[29–32] owing to which it demonstrates various advantageous properties such as a universal catalytic performance, high thermal and chemical stabilities, and a large specific surface area.[33,34] These characteristics render C3N<sup>4</sup> suitable for loading metals to obtain more effective catalysts.[35,36] However, the low conductivity of C3N<sup>4</sup> limits its utilization for a wide range of applications, and its conductivity has been observed to improve by doping P.[37,38] At the same time, the doped P atoms can also modulate the electronic properties of Cu in this catalyst to optimize the catalytic reaction kinetics and activity.[39,40]

In this study, single Cu atoms anchored on the surface of the P-doped C3N<sup>4</sup> substrate (Cu-SA/PCN) were prepared to function as catalysts. By studying the catalytic performance of HzOR, it was determined that Cu-SA/PCN has excellent catalytic activity and great durability for the HzOR occurring in alkaline electrolytes. This elucidated that Cu-SA/PCN can be used as a highly efficient and durable catalyst for HzOR. In 1.0 M KOH with 100 mM hydrazine, the required potential for achieving 100 mA cm-2 of current density was observed to be 0.336 V. This research provides new insights for the development of high-performance metal single-atom catalysts for HzOR.

#### **Results and Discussion**

As shown in Figure 1a, the synthesis of the Cu-SA/PCN catalyst was performed via pyrolyzing and phosphorizing the mixture of Cu precursors and urea. Further, P-doped C3N<sup>4</sup> (PCN) was also prepared using the same method; however, in this case, CuCl<sup>2</sup> was not added. The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the samples are shown in Figure 1b. The diffraction peaks at 13.0° and 27.4° were the typical (100) and (002) interlayer stacking-peaks obtained from g-C3N4, respectively.[41,42] However, no diffraction peaks of Cu were identified, this could be due to its low loading content of 1.25 wt.%, which was determined by using inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES). This result also ruled out the presence of large Cu particles or aggregates.

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed that both Cu-SA/PCN (Figure 1c and Figure S1) and PCN (Figure S2d) exhibited a uniform lamella structure without any evidence of a granular structure. Moreover, there were no observable Cu nanoclusters or nanoparticles in the TEM image, which was consistent with the XRD analysis results. Aberration corrected high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscope (HAADF-STEM) measurements were employed to observe the atomic dispersion of Cu atoms. As shown in Figure 1d, the aberration-corrected HAADF-STEM image of Cu-SA/PCN with an atomic resolution elucidates the small bright dots that are homogeneously distributed on the g-C3N<sup>4</sup> substrate. Some single Cu atoms were marked by red circles for better observation. Moreover, the HAADF-STEM image (Figure 1e) and the corresponding energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) mapping (Figure 1f) confirmed the homogeneous distribution of C, N, P, and Cu elements on the surface of the PCN substrate. Moreover, based on the results of EDS analysis, the atomic ratio of C and N is closed to 3:4. These results demonstrated that the g-C3N<sup>4</sup> in the Cu-SA/PNC has a good crystallinity.

(f) Corresponding EDX elemental mappings of C, N, P, and Cu in the Cu-SA/PCN sample.

The electronic structure and coordination configuration of Cu species in the Cu-SA/PNC sample were investigated by Xray absorption fine structure (XAFS). [43] As shown in Figure 2a, the X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectrum in the Cu *k*-edge spectra of Cu-SA/PCN shows that the near-edge spectra of Cu-SA/PNC are located between those of Cu foil and CuO, implying that the valence of the Cu single atom is situated between that of Cu<sup>0</sup> and Cu2+ . The Fourier transformed (FT) *k* 2 -

weighted extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectrum of Cu-SA/PCN displayed one prominent peak at 1.60 Å for the Cu−N coordination (Figure 2b). In contrast, Cu foil shows a typical Cu-Cu pair at 2.24 Å, and the Cu–O interaction of CuO sits around 1.53 Å. Based on these analysis results, it could be concluded that Cu atoms are atomically dispersed on the Cu/PCN catalyst. According to EXAFS fitting results (Figure 2c), the local structure of Cu-SA/PCN involves coordination by two N atoms (Figure 2d).

In addition, the surface chemical states of Cu-SA/PCN were further examined by using the high-resolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra. As revealed in the Cu 2p2/3 XPS spectrum in Figure S3a, the peak at 932.2 eV and 951.8 eV were ascribed to Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2 in Cu<sup>+</sup> . [44] The 2p peak of P located at 133.7 eV was attributed to the P-N bonds (Figure S3b). [45] As shown in Figure S3c, the highresolution N 1s XPS spectrum was observed for five peaks at 398.3, 398.9, 400.1, 401.0, and 404.3 eV, which could be assigned to pyridinic-N, Cu-N, pyrrolic-N, graphitic-N, and O-N, respectively.[46,47] The C 1s XPS spectrum of Cu-SA/PCN suggests the existence of C-C (284.8 eV), C-NH<sup>2</sup> (286.3 eV), and N-C=N (288.0 eV) bonds.[48]

The hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) performances of the Cu-SA/PCN were evaluated in a typical three-electrode configuration, wherein the Hg/HgO electrode and graphite rod are used as the reference and counter electrodes, respectively; further, an aqueous solution of 1 M KOH with different concentrations of hydrazine is used. Unless otherwise specified, the ohmic potential loss due to the solution resistance will be applied to all initial data.[49] Moreover, all potentials are calculated on a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale. Firstly, the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) with a scan rate of 5 mV s-1 was used to investigate the electrocatalytic properties for HzOR. Figure 3a shows the LSV curves that reveal the electrolytic performance of Cu-SA/PCN, PCN, and commercial Pt/C in 1 M KOH with 0.1 M N2H<sup>4</sup> aqueous electrolyte. The Cu-SA/PCN electrode displays a significantly better electrocatalytic activity than those of PCN, Pt/C, and other previously reported copper-based HzOR catalysts (Table S1).[7,10-11] In other words, the onset potential of the Cu-SA/PCN electrode is 0.16 V vs. RHE, which is almost equal to that of commercial Pt/C (0.13 V vs. RHE).[50] The Cu-SA/PCN electrode delivers the anodic current density of 10, 100, 200 mA cm−2 at 0.209, 0.336, and 0.413 V vs. RHE, respectively, indicating a more negative value than those of the PCN (0.329 V vs. RHE) and commercial Pt/C (0.185, 0.343, and 0.458 V vs. RHE) electrodes. The corresponding Tafel plot of the Cu-SA/PCN in Figure 3b showed that the Tafel slope of Cu-SA/PCN (142 mV dec−1 ) is significantly lower than that of PCN (209 mV dec−1 ), suggesting its favorable electrocatalytic kinetics toward HzOR.

**Figure 3. Electrocatalytic performance of Cu-SA/PCN for HzOR.** (a) HzOR polarization curves for Cu-SA/PCN, PCN, and the commercial 20 wt.% Pt/C in 1 M KOH with 0.1 M N2H<sup>4</sup> and (b) the corresponding Tafel plots. (c) The HzOR polarization curves of the Cu-SA/PCN catalyst in 1.0 M KOH with different concentrations of hydrazine and (d) the plots and corresponding linear fit of In j vs. In CN2H4 from (c) at 0.4 V vs. RHE. (e) Chronoamperometric curve of the Cu-SA/PCN catalyst with a constant potential of 0.3 V vs. RHE. (f) The HzOR polarization curve of the Cu-SA/PCN catalyst before and after 5,000 cyclic voltammetry tests.

To understand the superior HzOH activity of the Cu-SA/PCN as compared to that of PCN, the electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) analyses were carried out for both these catalysts by calculating the electrochemical double-layer capacitance (*C*dl), which was derived from the cyclic voltammograms (CV) under different scan rates.[51] Based on the results in Figure S4, the *C*dl value of Cu-SA/PCN (14.4 mF cm−2 ) was significantly higher than that of PCN (1.0 mF cm−2 ), indicating a greater number of electrochemically active sites of Cu-SA/PCN for HzOR than that of PCN. In addition, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was utilized to provide further insight into the electrochemical conductivity of the catalysts. As depicted in Figure S5, the Cu-SA/PCN electrocatalyst exhibits a significantly smaller charge transfer resistance than that of PCN, which leads to a highly efficient and rapid electron transport during the HzOR in the Cu-SA/PCN electrode. These results are in accordance with the smaller Tafel slope and superior HzOR kinetics of the Cu-SA/PCN catalyst.

Moreover, to elucidate the intrinsic nature of the catalytic activity of Cu-SA/PCN towards HzOR, the LSV curves with different concentrations of hydrazine were measured. As shown in Figure 4c, it can be observed that Cu-SA/PCN provides a negligible anodic current within the tested potential window of 0~0.5 V vs. RHE without hydrazine. In contrast, the anodic current density significantly increases with a rise in the hydrazine concentrations from 25 mM to 100 mM. By obtaining the relationship between the logarithm of the current density and the concentration of N2H<sup>4</sup> at 0.4 V vs. RHE from Figure 3c, the reaction sequence of N2H<sup>4</sup> can be obtained.[52] The plot of In *j* vs. In *C*N2H4 is a straight line with a slope of 1.03, which is approximately equal to 1 (Figure 3d). The reaction order obtained in this experiment by linear fitting is approximately 1, which is consistent with the stoichiometric coefficient of N2H<sup>4</sup> in equation (1); this result indicates that the catalytic reaction is consistent with the first-order kinetics of N2H<sup>4</sup> in the solution, implying that this is a basic reaction. The mechanism scheme of Cu-SA/PCN for catalyzing HzOR is shown in Figure S6. These observations prove that Cu-SA/PCN is an effective catalyst electrode for HzOR.

Further, the electrochemical stability of Cu-SA/PCN is evaluated by the chronoamperometric test at an applied potential of 0.3 V vs. RHE for 30 h. As shown in Figure 3e, there is an insignificant change in catalytic current after long-term electrolysis has been carried out. Additionally, HAADF-STEM imaging confirms the persistence of single Cu atoms on Cu-SA/PCN (Figure S7), suggesting the high stability of the Cu-SA/PCN electrode. Moreover, after performing the voltammetry scanning of 5,000 cycles (Figure 3f), the HzOR activity of the Cu-SA/PCN electrode was retained well with a small increase of only 19 mV, 31 mV and 21 mV at the current densities of 10, 100 and 200 mA cm-2 , respectively; this implied the effective charge and mass transfer of the HzOR catalytic process.[53,54] These results indicate that Cu-SA/PCN exhibits better catalytic performance for HzOR in alkaline media, which should be attributed to the high utilization rate of atomic Cu.[24, 55-57]

#### **Conclusion**

In summary, we successfully synthesized single Cu atoms that were anchored on the P-doped g-C3N<sup>4</sup> substrate. Further, we demonstrated that the single atom catalyst possessed excellent electrocatalytic performances for the hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) in the alkaline electrolyte under ambient conditions. Remarkably, the catalyst provides the current density of 10, 100, and 200 mA cm−2 at the low working potential of 0.209, 0.336, and 0.413 V vs. RHE, respectively, for HzOR in 1 M KOH and an aqueous solution of 0.1 M hydrazine. Notably, it also demonstrated excellent long-term electrocatalytic durability. **COMMUNICATION**

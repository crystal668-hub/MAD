**The current study presents a quick and simple method for synthesizing Ir nanoclusters decorated on an N-doped carbon (NC) matrix via pulsed laser ablation in liquid, followed by pyrolysis. The resulting Ir–NC material acts as a dual-functional electrocatalyst, efficiently facilitating hydrogen generation through the hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline seawater. The optimized Ir–NC-2 catalyst exhibits a low operating potential of 23 mV versus the reversible hydrogen electrode for HzOR and a remarkably low overpotential of 24 mV for HER, achieving a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> in alkaline seawater, surpassing the performance of the Pt/C catalyst. Notably, the Ir–NC-2 catalyst also demonstrates superior dual-functionality in overall hydrazine-assisted seawater splitting, requiring only 0.1 V at 10 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> while maintaining stability. Moreover, density functional theory calculations reveal that the strong electronic interaction between the Ir nanoclusters and the NC matrix enhances mass transfer and electron conductivity, significantly boosting HER activity and accelerating the kinetics of hydrazine dehydrogenation. Consequently, the Ir–NC-2 catalyst performs efficiently in a Zn–hydrazine battery, achieving high energy efficiency of 95.5% and demonstrating excellent stability for 120 h (360 cycles), indicating its potential for practical applications.**

## **1. Introduction**

Hydrogen (H2) is considered an ideal energy source due to its zero emissions and high energy density of 142.351 MJ kg<sup>−</sup>1, making it a promising alternative to conventional fossil fuels in the pursuit of a carbonfree society.[\[1,2\]](#page-14-0) Electrochemical water electrolysis is widely regarded as an economical and environmentally friendly method for enhancing renewable energy use and facilitating large-scale H2 production.[\[3,4\]](#page-14-0) Currently, most water electrolysis systems rely on freshwater as the electrolyte. However, the limited availability of freshwater worldwide poses a significant challenge to largescale industrial H2 generation.[\[5,6\]](#page-14-0) Seawater, which accounts for 96.5% of the global water supply, offers a sustainable solution for large-scale H2 production without exacerbating freshwater scarcity.[\[7\]](#page-14-0) Nonetheless, the high chloride ion concentration (≈0.5 m) and the presence of hypochlorite in seawater can activate the chlorine oxidation reaction (ClOR) at industrially relevant current densities on the anode, which

competes with the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), thereby diminishing the efficiency of seawater electrolysis and accelerating electrode corrosion.[\[8,9\]](#page-14-0) This challenge can be overcome by replacing the OER with a thermodynamically favorable small molecule electro-oxidation reaction, coupled with the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Among these, the hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) stands out due to its significantly lower potential (−0.33 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)) and the generation of harmless products.[\[10,11\]](#page-14-0) Furthermore, hydrazine is extensively used as a raw material in various chemical and pharmaceutical industries, making the development of efficient methods to degrade hydrazine wastewater critical for environmental protection. Therefore, pairing HzOR with seawater electrolysis offers multiple advantages: it reduces the voltage required for H2 generation, mitigates ClOR, and eliminates harmful hydrazine from industrial wastewater without the need of additional oxidants, effectively addressing three challenges simultaneously. Recent research has focused on the innovative rechargeable zinc-hydrazine (Zn–Hz) battery, which has demonstrated efficient hydrogen production and separation through decoupled hydrazine splitting,

utilizing two distinct cathodic reactions: HER during discharge and HzOR during charge. This method presents a decoupled approach to self-sustaining hydrogen production.[\[12,13\]](#page-14-0) It is important to note that the anodic HzOR process plays a crucial role in ensuring efficient hydrogen generation in both electrolyzer and Zn–Hz battery systems.

Discovering exceptional and steady electrocatalysts for bifunctional activities is essential for developing energy conversion systems including OER, HzOR, HER, and Zn–Hz batteries. Noble metal-based catalysts have demonstrated remarkable potential for bifunctional activity owing to their outstanding reaction kinetics and intrinsic catalytic efficiency.[\[14,15\]](#page-14-0) Particularly, iridium (Ir)-based electrocatalysts are excellent candidates for the bifunctional catalytic performance of energy conversion because they sit near the top of both volcano plots and exhibit outstanding performance.[\[16,17\]](#page-14-0) However, Ir is an exceptionally scarce noble metal, leading to high costs that restrict its large-scale industrial use. Moreover, Ir-based electrocatalysts are prone to electrolyte corrosion during electrochemical processes, resulting in reduced working lifetime and low stability of the catalysts. These factors pose major obstacles to the utilization of Ir-based electrocatalysts in bifunctional activities. To address these issues, researchers have developed strategies to combine small amounts of Ir with robust and cost-effective support materials. This approach reduces the catalyst costs while enhancing catalytic performance and stability, making Ir-based electrocatalysts more suitable for large-scale industrial applications.[\[18,19\]](#page-14-0) Recent studies have highlighted the considerable size-dependent effects of nanoclusters on catalysis compared to their bulk materials due to their high ratio of low-coordination atoms to high-coordination atoms and strong binding energy between reactants and metal catalysts.[\[20,21\]](#page-14-0) Additionally, the bifunctional activity of Ir is significantly influenced by the properties of its nanoclusters, including their distribution, crystallinity, cluster size, and the nature of the supporting materials.[\[22,23\]](#page-14-0)

Nanoclusters can be supported on various materials, including different types of carbon, metal carbides, sulfides, oxides, hydroxides, and phosphides.[\[24–26\]](#page-14-0) Among these, carbon-based materials, particularly N-doped carbon (NC) derived from metal– organic frameworks (MOFs), have demonstrated exceptional electrical conductivity and are highly effective for electrochemical bifunctional activity. Recently, zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIF-8) have emerged as promising precursors for synthesizing NC materials due to their high nitrogen content, which facilitates self-doping without the need of additional nitrogen sources. In addition, ZIF-8 is cost-effective and features a large cavity volume, an ordered porous structure, extensive surface area, and versatile metal nodes.[\[27,28\]](#page-14-0) Typically, ZIF-8 is synthesized using methods such as co-precipitation and hydrothermal approaches.[\[29,30\]](#page-14-0) However, ZIF-8 can be produced in a more environmentally friendly and simplified manner. Pulsed laser ablation in liquid (PLAL) has been identified as an ecologically sustainable and straightforward method for synthesizing ZIF-8, requiring only a ligand source and a Zn metal rod.[\[31,32\]](#page-14-0) The advantages of this technique include time efficiency and the elimination of reducing agents or surfactants. As a result, materials synthesized under the non-equilibrium conditions of PLAL exhibit superior performance in energy and environmental applications compared to those produced using conventional methods.[\[33–35\]](#page-14-0) Inspired by the unique attributes of the PLAL method, the synthesis of ideal Ir nanoclusters with abundant active surface atoms is crucial to achieving outstanding bifunctional catalytic performance for energy-efficient hybrid water electrolysis in alkaline seawater, while also minimizing costs.

Motivated by these approaches, ZIF-8 was synthesized through the PLAL method and then utilized as the precursor to design an NC matrix decorated with Ir nanoclusters (Ir–NC). The resulting Ir–NC catalysts demonstrated superb dual-functional electrocatalytic performance for HzOR and HER in alkaline seawater electrolysis. Electrochemical investigations revealed that the optimized Ir–NC-2 catalyst displayed an extremely low operating potential of 23 mV (vs RHE) for HzOR and a minimal overpotential of 24 mV for HER to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> in an alkaline seawater solution. The catalysts demonstrated great electrocatalytic activity of both HzOR and HER than the benchmark Pt/C in alkaline seawater. This remarkable dual-functional catalytic activity of the Ir–NC-2 is attributed to the beneficial interaction between the highly porous NC matrix and the highly active Ir nanoclusters. Notably, the Ir–NC-2 catalyst was employed for overall hydrazine-assisted seawater splitting to attain energyeffective H2 generation in a two-electrode system. In this configuration, the catalyst exhibited an ultra-low cell voltage of 0.1 V at a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2, along with excellent stability. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further confirmed that the strong interaction between the Ir nanoclusters and the NC matrix enhances both mass transfer and electronic conductivity, significantly improving the HER performance and hydrazine dehydrogenation kinetics. In addition, the practical application of the dual-functional activity of the Ir–NC-2 electrocatalyst was showcased by integrating it into a Zn–Hz battery, reaching a remarkably high energy efficiency of 95.5%. This underscores its important potential for practical applications. This study introduces an attractive technique for developing minimal Ir nanoclusters embedded within the NC matrix, positioning it as an excellent option for energy-efficient H2 generation in alkaline seawater.

## **2. Results and Discussion**

#### **2.1. Morphology and Structural Investigation**

As illustrated in **Figure 1**[a,](#page-2-0) Ir nanoclusters were synthesized on an NC matrix using a simple and rapid PLAL, followed by simultaneous pyrolysis. The initial step involved the synthesis of ZIF-8 via the ablation of a high-purity Zn metal target with a monochromatic laser beam in the presence of 2-methylimidazole in an alkaline KOH solution. During the PLAL process, Zn metal ions were generated from the ablation of the Zn target under the focused laser beam, which subsequently coordinated with 2 methylimidazole. The addition of KOH to the synthesis medium created an alkaline environment that facilitated the deprotonation of 2-methylimidazole, enhancing its interaction with Zn ions and promoting the formation of the ZIF-8 framework. This was followed by carbonization of ZIF-8 at 900 °C and acid etching, leading to the formation of the NC matrix. Then, the NC matrix was soaked in an aqueous solution of IrCl3·*x*H2O and heated at 85 °C for 5 h to absorb Ir precursors into the NC matrix. Subsequently, pyrolysis at 400 °C under an N2 atmosphere led to the

development of Ir nanoclusters anchored on the surface of the NC matrix. To explore the effect of varying Ir content on catalytic performance, a series of Ir-NC catalysts were synthesized by adjusting the amount of IrCl3·xH2O to 2.5, 5.0, and 7.5 mg. The resulting Ir-NC catalysts were designated as Ir-NC-1, Ir-NC-2, and Ir-NC-3, respectively, for clarity and ease of identification. The morphology and microstructure of the as-synthesized catalysts were observed by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) characterization. As displayed in Figure S1a,b (Supporting Information), the FE-SEM image of the ZIF-8 synthesized using the PLAL process demonstrates a rhombic dodecahedron shape with an average diameter of 250 nm. Then direct heated of ZIF-8 at 900 °C, the resultant Zn–NC and NC retained their original rhombic dodecahedron shapes, but

**[www.advancedsciencenews.com](http://www.advancedsciencenews.com) [www.small-journal.com](http://www.small-journal.com)**

the surfaces became notably rougher than that of ZIF-8, as shown in Figures S2a,b (Supporting Information) and Figures 1b,c, respectively. Likewise, varying amounts of Ir nanoclusters were attached on the NC matrix surface while retaining identical morphological shapes of the nanoclusters, as illustrated in Figure [1d,e](#page-2-0) and Figures S4a,b,S5a,b (Supporting Information). Moreover, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and highresolution TEM (HR-TEM) characterization were performed to analyze both the surface morphology and crystalline structure of the as-synthesized catalysts. TEM images of ZIF-8 demonstrate a smooth surface within the rhombic dodecahedron shape, as illustrated in Figure S6a,b (Supporting Information). In contrast, as displayed in Figure [1f–g](#page-2-0) and Figure S6d,e (Supporting Information), TEM images of the NC matrix and Zn–NC exhibit irregular shapes with a micropore-dominated structure, attributed to the evaporation of Zn and organic ligand during high-temperature processes and acid etching of Zn–NC and the NC matrix. HR-TEM images in Figure S6c,f (Supporting Information) and Figure [1h](#page-2-0) show no distinct lattice fringes for ZIF-8, Zn–NC, and NC matrix, demonstrating their amorphous nature. In Figure S7a,b (Supporting Information), TEM images of the Ir–NC-1 catalyst indicate no Ir nanoclusters on the NC matrix surface, probably owing to minimal Ir content, suggesting Ir may be doped inside the NC matrix. In contrast, the Ir–NC-2 catalyst exhibits evenly distributed Ir nanoclusters on the NC matrix surface, with an average Ir particle size of 4– 5 nm, as displayed in Figure [1i,j.](#page-2-0) This arrangement boosts electron and mass transfer kinetics during electrochemical reactions, thereby enhancing electrocatalytic activity for HER and HzOR. With increased Ir content, the Ir–NC-3 catalyst reveals Ir forming both nanoclusters and nanoparticles decorating the NC matrix supports, with an average nanoparticle size of 10–15 nm, as illustrated in Figure S7d,e (Supporting Information). To further verify the HR-TEM evaluation, no lattice fringes were observed in the Ir–NC-1 catalyst, indicating Ir doping within the NC matrix, as displayed in Figure S7c (Supporting Information). HR-TEM analysis of the Ir–NC-2 and Ir–NC-3 catalysts revealed an interplanar distance of 0.217 nm, ascribed to the (111) planes in the face-centered cubic (*fcc*) structure of Ir nanoclusters, as illustrated in Figure [1k–l](#page-2-0) and Figure S7f (Supporting Information), which was further confirmed through XRD analysis. Energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) mapping outcomes for the ZIF-8 catalyst, displayed in Figure S1c (Supporting Information), reveal even dispersion of Zn, N, C, and O within the rhombic dodecahedron structure of ZIF-8. Particularly, the weight percentage of Zn in ZIF-8 is 9.30%. Upon carbonization of ZIF-8 to form Zn–NC, the weight percentage of Zn reduces to 4.22% owing to Zn evaporation during the pyrolysis process (Figure S2c, Supporting Information). Subsequent acid washing to eliminate the remaining Zn reduces the Zn weight percentage in the NC matrix to only 0.19%, as illustrated in Figure S3 (Supporting Information). Moreover, the EDS mapping analysis presented in Figure [1m](#page-2-0) and Figures S4c,S5c (Supporting Information) clearly reveals different loading contents of Ir on the NC matrix. The investigation illustrates 2.87, 6.42, and 9.56 wt.% of Ir evenly distributed within the NC matrix for Ir– NC-1, Ir–NC-2, and Ir–NC-3, respectively. This comprehensive evidence confirms the effective synthesis of the Ir-decorated NC matrix.

The phase and crystal structure nature of the synthesized catalysts were characterized through powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD). The XRD patterns of the synthesized ZIF-8, NC, and Ir–NC catalysts are shown in Figure S8 (Supporting Information) and **Figure 2**[a.](#page-4-0) ZIF-8 demonstrated excellent alignment with distinctive peaks corresponding to (011), (002), (112), (013), and (222) planes at 2 values of 7.25°, 10.4°, 12.5°, 16.7°, and 18°, respectively (CCDC no.602542)[\[36\]](#page-14-0) (Figure S8a, Supporting Information). The XRD pattern of the NC matrix demonstrated characteristic peaks solely for the graphitic carbon (002) crystal plane at 23.6°, with no observable peaks from monomeric Zn, indicating primarily carbon-based materials resulting from pyrolysis (Figure [2a\)](#page-4-0). Moreover, upon incorporation of the NC matrix with various amounts of Ir nanoclusters, distinct diffraction peaks appeared at 40.8° and 47.2° in the XRD patterns of Ir– NC catalysts, corresponding to the (111) and (200) planes of Ir nanoclusters, indicative of a *fcc* metallic crystal structure (JCPDS no. 06–0598).[\[37\]](#page-14-0) These findings reveal the effective incorporation of Ir nanoclusters into the NC matrix. Furthermore, the intensity of Ir diffraction peaks increases with rising Ir content, implying a corresponding enhancement in peak intensity. Raman spectroscopy was utilized to explore the structural characteristics of the synthesized catalysts, as displayed in Figure S8b (Supporting Information) and Figure [2b.](#page-2-0) The Raman spectra of the ZIF-8 demonstrated several peaks at 1501, 1460, 1165, 1142, and 686 cm<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> (Figure S8b, Supporting Information), ascribed to vibrational modes of the 2-methylimidazole ligand.[\[38\]](#page-14-0) Following the carbonization of the NC matrix and the decoration of Ir on the surface of the NC matrix catalysts, Raman spectroscopy was used to identify fundamental defects and the degree of graphitization in these carbon-based catalysts.[\[39\]](#page-14-0) In Figure [2b,](#page-4-0) all catalysts show distinct peaks at 1580 cm<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> (G band) and 1338 cm<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> (D band), which correspond to graphitic carbon and defective carbon, respectively. The ratio of the intensities of the D and G band (*I*D/*I*G) is a widely used metric to assess defect density and the degree of graphitization in carbon-based materials. Notably, the *I*D/*I*<sup>G</sup> ratio decreases from 1.08 in the NC matrix to 1.01 in the Ir–NC-3 catalyst, indicating that an increase in Ir content in the NC matrix enhances the graphitic carbon content. This improvement suggests better electrical conductivity, which is expected to enhance the electrochemical performance of HER and HzOR.[\[40\]](#page-14-0)

The valence states and surface elemental composition of the synthesized catalysts were estimated via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). As illustrated in Figure S9 (Supporting Information), the XPS full survey spectra of ZIF-8, Zn–NC, NC matrix, and Ir–NC-2 catalysts show the existence of Ir, Zn, N, and C consistent with the FE-SEM elemental mapping results discussed earlier. As displayed in Figure [2c,](#page-4-0) the high-resolution XPS C 1*s* spectra of synthesized ZIF-8 display two separate peaks at 285.9 and 284.6 eV, assigned to the C─N and C═C bonds, respectively.[\[41\]](#page-14-0) The high-resolution C 1*s* spectra of Zn–NC, NC matrix, and Ir–NC-2 catalysts show three resolved peaks at 284.4, 286.2, and 288.4 eV, attributed to C═C, C─N, and C═O, respectively.[\[42,43\]](#page-14-0) The detection of C─N bonds at 286.2 eV demonstrates N doping in all catalysts following carbonization. In Figure S10a (Supporting Information), the high-resolution N 1*s* spectra show that the ZIF-8 catalyst reveal two separate peaks at 400.5 and 398.8 eV, corresponding to C–N and Zn–N, respectively.[\[44\]](#page-14-0) In contrast, the Zn–NC, NC

matrix, and Ir–NC-2 catalysts demonstrate three peaks at 402.4, 399.6, and 398.1 eV, corresponding to graphitic N, pyrrolic N, and pyridinic N, respectively.[\[45,46\]](#page-14-0) Pyridinic and pyrrolic N are considered exceptionally active sites in electrochemical performance owing to their abundant lone pairs of electrons. In addition, the existence of graphitic N may boost electrical conductivity, potentially leading to the greater catalytic performance of the Ir–NC-2 catalyst, which exhibits both enhanced performance and conductivity.[\[47,48\]](#page-14-0) Additionally, a peak ≈405.1 eV, corresponding to oxidized nitrogen species (particularly

nitrogen–oxygen bonds) is observed. This may result from surface oxidation or the adsorption of nitrogen-containing species during synthesis.[\[49\]](#page-14-0) In the Zn 2*p* high-resolution XPS spectrum of the ZIF-8 catalyst, the peaks were deconvoluted into a pair at 1021.6 and 1044.6 eV, attributed to the spin orbitals of Zn<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> for Zn 2*p*3/2 and Zn 2*p*1/2, correspondingly (Figure S10b, Supporting Information).[\[50\]](#page-14-0) The intensity of the Zn 2*p* XPS peak was reduced in the Zn–NC catalyst owing to Zn evaporation during pyrolysis. Furthermore, the NC and Ir–NC-2 catalysts demonstrated no discernible peaks in the Zn 2*p* XPS spectrum, indicating the effective removal of Zn during acid washing. These results indicate that the Ir–NC-2 catalyst has minimal Zn content, potentially enhancing its electrochemical performance. As displayed in Figure [2d,](#page-4-0) the high-resolution XPS spectrum of Ir 4*f* in the Ir–NC-2 catalyst reveals distinct peaks. Specifically, the peaks detected at 63.4 and 61.1 eV are ascribed to the metallic state of Ir, while peaks observed at 64.7 and 62.2 eV indicate the existence of Ir<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup>, likely due to surface oxidation of the Ir metal.[\[22\]](#page-14-0) No Ir peaks were detected in the ZIF-8, Zn–NC, and NC matrix. These XPS outcomes reveal the effective synthesis of NC derived from ZIF-8 employing the advanced pulsed laser method and the decoration of Ir nanoclusters on the surface of the NC matrix through a wet chemical approach.

Furthermore, a detailed investigation of the chemical state and coordination structure of the Ir species in the Ir–NC-2 catalyst was conducted using X-ray absorption spectroscopy. The X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) at the Ir *L*3-edge for the Ir–NC-2 catalyst was analyzed and compared with reference samples, including Ir foil and IrO2, as shown in Figure [2e.](#page-4-0) The results indicate that the white line intensity at the *L*3-edge for Ir in the Ir–NC-2 catalyst is higher than that of the Ir foil, suggesting a slightly increased valence state of Ir, likely due to partial surface oxidation.[\[51\]](#page-14-0) To further examine the fine structure and coordination environment of the Ir species in the Ir– NC-2 catalyst, Fourier transform extended X-ray absorption fine structure (FT-EXAFS) analysis was performed, as presented in Figure [2f.](#page-4-0) The spectra show the presence of shorter Ir─C bonds at ≈1.81 Å, which may be attributed to a reduction in the Ir─Ir bond length and a decrease in the coordination number of Ir in the Ir─Ir bonds compared to Ir foil. This observation suggests the formation of a strong coordination environment between the NC matrix and the surface-decorated Ir nanoclusters in the Ir–NC-2 catalyst.[\[39,52\]](#page-14-0) In addition, wavelet transform EX-AFS analysis was conducted to further confirm the Ir–C coordination in the Ir–NC-2 catalyst, as shown in Figure [2g.](#page-4-0) The Ir–NC-2 catalyst exhibits a single prominent signal at 7.1 Å<sup>−</sup>1, corresponding to Ir–C coordination, while signals corresponding to Ir–O and Ir–Ir coordination are absent. In contrast, the reference samples, Ir foil, and IrO2, predominantly display signals related to Ir–Ir and Ir–O coordination in their wavelet transform EXAFS spectra. This analysis indicates that the Ir nanoclusters in the Ir–NC-2 catalyst is strongly coordinated with carbon, which reduces the electron density at the Ir sites. This electronic modulation is expected to enhance the electrocatalytic performance of the Ir–NC-2 catalyst toward both HER and HzOR. FE-SEM, EDS, XRD, Raman, and XPS intruements housed within the Core-Facility Center for Photochemistry & Nanomaterials, Gyeongsang National University, South Korea, were used for the characterization.

#### **2.2. Electrochemical Performance of Ir–NC Catalyst for HER**

The electrocatalytic HER activity of the synthesized catalysts and benchmark Pt/C for comparison was determined in a 1 M KOH solution utilizing an established three-electrode configuration. As illustrated in the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves in **Figure 3**[a,](#page-6-0) the HER efficiency of ZIF-8 and NC matrix is very poor activity. However, incorporating Ir nanoclusters on the NC matrix surface greatly improves the HER activity. The HER performance demonstrates that the Ir–NC-2 catalyst demands a minimal overpotential of 26 and 114 mV to attain current densities of 10 and 50 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2, correspondingly, which are higher compared to the other as-synthesized catalysts: Ir–NC-1 (89 and 237 mV), Ir–NC-3 (40 and 160 mV), and benchmark Pt/C (37 and 148 mV). Despite having a lower Ir content, the Ir–NC-2 catalyst exhibited superior catalytic efficiency compared to Pt/C. In contrast, the decreased HER performance of the Ir–NC-3 catalyst is attributed to the excessive Ir content on the NC matrix surface, leading to the formation of both nanoclusters and nanoparticles. This excess Ir reduces the effective surface area and limits the number of accessible active sites, ultimately impairing the HER performance. On the other hand, the Ir-NC-2 catalyst displayed a more uniform distribution of Ir nanoclusters across the NC matrix, which facilitates ions and electron transfer and increases the number of active sites, thereby enhancing its electrocatalytic performance for HER. To better understand the enhanced HER activity, the Tafel slopes of the catalyst were estimated,[\[53\]](#page-14-0) as illustrated in Figure [3b.](#page-6-0) The calculated Tafel slope results are 173.1, 170.5, 86.6, 53.6, 53.8, and 54.1 mV dec<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> for ZIF-8, NC matrix, Ir–NC-1, Ir–NC-2, Ir–NC-3, and Pt/C, respectively. Among all the synthesized catalysts, Ir–NC-2 demonstrates the lowest Tafel slope value, suggesting a more rapid charge transfer kinetic process. This low Tafel slope value implies the dominance of the Volmer–Heyrovsky reaction mechanism in the electrochemical HER process using the Ir–NC-2 catalyst. The histogram shown in Figure [3c](#page-6-0) reveals a consistent improvement in electrocatalytic efficiency and Tafel slope compared with those of the Pt/C. Additionally, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) investigations were conducted to evaluate the charge transfer rates of the synthesized catalysts. As displayed in Figure [3d,](#page-6-0) the Nyquist plot of the Ir–NC-2 catalyst illustrates a small semicircle at an applied voltage of 100 mV versus RHE. The calculated charge transfer resistance (*R*ct) is 0.55 Ω, which is considerably lower than that of ZIF-8 (123.5 Ω), NC matrix (60.1 Ω), Ir–NC-1 (5.85 Ω), Ir–NC-3 (0.63 Ω), and Pt/C (1.03 Ω). This low *R*ct value indicates enhanced electron charge transfer kinetics at the interface within the electrolyte on the Ir–NC-2 catalyst.[\[54\]](#page-14-0) Furthermore, the onset position in the low-frequency region of a Nyquist plot can be used to determine the internal resistance of a catalyst. Herein, the addition of the NC matrix improves electrical conductivity and reduces the internal resistance of Ir nanoclusters.[\[55\]](#page-14-0)

Turnover frequency (TOF) and mass activity (MA) were measured to elucidate the intrinsic efficiency of the synthesized catalysts in the electrochemical HER process. TOF was estimated by analyzing the number of active sites, among all the synthesized catalysts, Ir–NC-2 exhibited the highest TOF value across different potentials, as illustrated in Figure [3e.](#page-6-0) At an overpotential of 100 mV, the TOF value of the Ir–NC-2 catalyst reached 1.30 s<sup>−</sup>1, higher than that of Ir–NC-1 (0.31 s<sup>−</sup>1), Ir–NC-3 (0.79 s<sup>−</sup>1), and

<span id="page-6-0"></span>**Figure 3.** Electrochemical HER performance: a) LSV plots, b) Tafel slopes, c) comparison of overpotential with the achieved current density and Tafel slopes, d) Nyquist plots at 50 mV versus RHE, e) turnover frequency, f) MAs, g) double-layer capacitance of various catalysts, h) LSV plot comparison in different electrolyte solutions, and i) HER stability test of the Ir–NC-2 catalyst.

Pt/C (2.25 s<sup>−</sup>1). This indicates that the Ir–NC-2 catalyst markedly enhanced the rate of H2 production per active site during the HER process. Figure 3f shows the MA of the synthesized catalysts within overpotential ranges from 50 to 100 mV versus RHE. The Ir–NC-2 catalyst exhibited an impressive MA of 42.25 A g<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> at 100 mV versus RHE, higher than that of Ir–NC-1 (11.92 A g<sup>−</sup>1), Ir–NC-3(39.3 A g<sup>−</sup>1), and Pt/C (32.7 A g<sup>−</sup>1). Furthermore, the overall electrode performance is directly influenced through the number of active sites on the surface of the electrode and their intrinsic performance. Consequently, the electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) was assessed by determining the electrochemical double-layer capacitance (*C*dl) from the non-Faradaic CV region, using scan rates ranging from 10 to 100 mV s<sup>−</sup>1, as displayed in Figure S11a–d (Supporting Information). As displayed in Figure 3g, the Ir–NC-2 catalyst displayed a *C*dl value of 46.3 mF cm<sup>−</sup>2, considerably greater than other synthesized catalysts: Ir–NC-1 (17.1 mF cm<sup>−</sup>2), Ir–NC-3 (37.7 mF cm<sup>−</sup>2), and Pt/C (35.1 mF cm<sup>−</sup>2). Afterward, the ECSA value for Ir–NC-2 was determined to be 0.53 cm<sup>−</sup>2, notably larger than that of Ir–NC-1 (0.19 cm<sup>−</sup>2), Ir–NC-3 (0.42 cm<sup>−</sup>2), and Pt/C (0.39 cm<sup>−</sup>2). This finding suggests that the Ir–NC-2 possesses the greatest number of available active surface sites for boosting the electrocatalytic HER performance. Likewise, to analyze the intrinsic activity of the catalysts, the current density was normalized to ECSA, as illustrated in Figure S11e (Supporting Information). Notably, the intrinsic performance of Ir–NC-2 is higher than that of the other synthesized catalysts. The higher TOF, MA, and ECSA values noticed in the Ir–NC-2 catalyst collectively suggest that the Ir nanoclusters enhance the intrinsic electrocatalytic activity for HER owing to their optimal amount decorated on the NC matrix surface.

Based on the superior HER activity of the Ir–NC-2 in a freshwater alkaline electrolyte solution, we proceeded to assess its electrocatalytic performance in alkaline seawater (Seawater with 1 m KOH) and simulated seawater (0.5 m NaCl with 1 m KOH). As illustrated in Figure 3h and Figures S12,S13 (Supporting

Information), the Ir–NC-2 catalyst consistently displays excellent HER catalytic efficiency in both simulated seawater and alkaline seawater. It requires merely 23 and 109 mV overpotential to attain current densities of 10 and 50 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2, respectively, in alkaline simulated seawater and 24 and 112 mV in alkaline seawater. In addition, it demonstrates small Tafel slope values of 55.9 and 54.5 mV dec<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> (Figures S12b,S13b, Supporting Information) and low *R*ct of 0.51 and 0.60 Ω (Figures S12d,S13d, Supporting Information) for alkaline simulated seawater and alkaline seawater, respectively. Stability is another crucial factor for assessing electrocatalysts for practical applications. To estimate the stability of the Ir–NC-2 catalyst, chronoamperometry (*v*–*t*) analysis was conducted at a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> in an alkaline seawater electrolyte, and the corresponding outcomes are demonstrated in Figure [3i.](#page-6-0) Following 50 h of continuous evaluation, only minimal activity decay was noticed of the Ir–NC-2, suggesting high stability over extended durations in HER processes. Several characterizations were performed to examine any modifications in the Ir–NC-2 catalyst following the stability test. The XRD patterns of the Ir–NC-2 catalyst illustrated no major changes before and after the stability test in alkaline seawater electrolyte solution, as shown in Figure S14 (Supporting Information). SEM images showed that the rhombic dodecahedron morphological structure remained largely intact, with only slight agglomeration observed after the HER stability test, which is likely due to the continuous hydrogen generation at the electrode surface. EDS mapping confirmed the uniform distribution of Ir, O, N, and C elements in the Ir–NC-2 catalyst before and after the HER stability test (Figures S15,S16, Supporting Information). The electronic state of the Ir–NC-2 catalyst after the HER stability test was investigated employing XPS characterization, as displayed in Figure S17 (Supporting Information). The Ir 4*f* XPS spectra after the HER stability test demonstrate that the Ir 4*f* state remains unchanged under alkaline seawater circumstances, as shown in Figure S17 (Supporting Information). These findings highlight the extraordinary HER stability and structural integrity of the Ir–NC-2 catalyst, indicating its robustness as an effective HER catalyst in alkaline seawater electrolytes. Additionally, the HER activity of the Ir–NC-2 catalyst was related with that of previously discovered HER catalysts in different electrolyte solutions, as illustrated in Table S1 (Supporting Information). This outcome shows that the Ir–NC-2 catalyst is among the most effective catalysts for electrocatalytic HER under different electrolyte conditions. The HER performance tests reveal that the HER properties of the NC matrix are markedly improved by decorating it with Ir nanoclusters. The strongly graphitized NC matrix, efficient mass/charge transfer of polyhedral array structure, and well-dispersed Ir active sites of Ir-NC-2 catalyst collectively contribute to exceptionally improved electrocatalytic reaction kinetics, boosted electrocatalytic efficiency, and outstanding stability in the HER process. Impressively, the Ir– NC-2 catalyst demonstrates higher HER catalytic activity in alkaline, alkaline seawater, alkaline simulated seawater and conditions associated to the Pt/C. This superiority can be ascribed to the beneficial contact among the NC matrix and Ir nanoclusters. Consequently, the Ir–NC-2 catalyst proves to be an outstanding HER catalyst for alkaline seawater across a wide range of current densities, revealing its suitability for industrial-scale HER catalysis.

#### **2.3. Electrochemical Performance of Ir–NC Catalyst for HzOR**

The electrocatalytic HzOR activity of the synthesized catalysts was explored under conditions identical to the HER performance, with the addition of hydrazine to 1 m KOH solution. The HzOR performance of the Ir–NC-2 catalyst was assessed in 1 m KOH using various hydrazine concentrations (0 to 0.5 m), as illustrated in Figure S18 (Supporting Information). The Ir–NC-2 catalyst demonstrated a sharp rise in current as the hydrazine concentration was raised. The gradual current increase with elevated N2H4 amounts suggests that the current correlates with the concentration of the reactive substance in the solution. However, when the N2H4 concentration reached 0.5 m, the oxidation current peaked, indicating that additional hydrazine could not be immediately oxidized owing to the limited active sites on the Ir–NC-2 surface. **Figure [4](#page-8-0)**a shows that the Ir–NC-2 catalyst achieved minimal operating potentials of 120 mV (vs RHE) at a current density of 50 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> in 0.5 m N2H4 with 1 m KOH electrolyte solution. In contrast, the slow OER requires 1.72 V (vs RHE) to reach a similar current density level in 1 m KOH electrolyte. This notable decrease in anode potential is extremely advantageous for H2 production at a low energy cost. To recognize the active phase for HzOR, the activity of various regulated as-synthesized catalysts, such as ZIF-8, NC matrix, Ir–NC-1, Ir–NC-2, Ir–NC-3, and benchmark Pt/C catalysts, was examined under the same conditions, as displayed in Figure [4b.](#page-8-0) The ZIF-8 and NC matrix were inactive during HzOR. Among the as-synthesized catalysts assessed, the Ir–NC-2 catalyst demonstrated the best catalytic performance for hydrazine oxidation, requiring an extremely small operating potential of 10 mV versus RHE at 10 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2. This is considerably lower than the potential needed for Ir–NC-1 (126 mV at 10 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2) and Ir– NC-3 (21 mV at 10 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2), confirming its superior hydrazine catalysis capacity. Furthermore, the required potential of the Ir– NC-2 at 10 and 100 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> is remarkably more negative than benchmark Pt/C (68 and 316 mV vs RHE), which further supports the high HzOR efficiency of the Ir–NC-2 catalyst. The reaction kinetics of the as-synthesized catalysts for HzOR were studied through Tafel slope values. As depicted in Figure [4c,](#page-8-0) the Tafel slope values of the Ir–NC-2 catalyst was only 47.4 mV dec<sup>−</sup>1, significantly lower than that of Ir–NC-1 (87.9 mv dec<sup>−</sup>1), Ir–NC-3 (48.6 mv dec<sup>−</sup>1), and Pt/C (64.2 mv dec<sup>−</sup>1). This implies that the Ir–NC-2 catalyst demonstrates the fastest hydrazine oxidation reaction kinetics on the electrode, as demonstrated by its lowest Tafel slope value. Figure [4d](#page-8-0) contrasts the HzOR working potential at a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> with the Tafel values for the as-synthesized catalysts, highlighting that Ir–NC-2 surpasses the other as-synthesized catalysts. These results emphasize that the Ir nanoclusters decorated onto the NC matrix drastically raise the reaction kinetics, thus substantially enhancing the HzOR performance. Likewise, the *R*ct values of the as-synthesized catalysts in HzOR were assessed via EIS, as depicted in Figure [4e.](#page-8-0) The *R*ct of the Ir–NC-2 catalyst was 0.57 Ω, notably smaller than that of those other as-synthesized catalysts, such as Ir–NC-1, Ir–NC-3, and Pt/C (4.98, 0.62, and 1.94 Ω, respectively). The minimal *R*ct delivers additional support for the fastest HzOR kinetics of the Ir–NC-2 catalyst.

As an alternative for industrial applications, the HzOR efficiency of the developed Ir–NC-2 catalyst was further analyzed

in 0.5 m N2H4 + seawater + 1 m KOH (alkaline seawater) and 0.5 m N2H4 + 0.5 m NaCl + 1 m KOH (alkaline simulated seawater) electrolyte solutions. As displayed in Figure 4f, the LSV polarization curves of the Ir–NC-2 catalyst maintain an excellent HzOR activity in simulated seawater, the same to that found in 1 m KOH solution. A slight decrease in activity is noted in alkaline seawater, likely owing to electrode fouling caused by organic pollutants (e.g., microorganisms, bacteria, and small particles) and the high concentration of divalent cations (e.g., Mg2<sup>+</sup> and Ca2<sup>+</sup>) on the anode surface.[\[56\]](#page-14-0) Despite these challenges, the Ir– NC-2 catalyst maintains of 50, 100, and 200 cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> current densities at working potentials of 125, 242, and 456 mV, respectively. These values are specifically lower than the triggering potential for ClER, implying its distinctive selection for HzOR even in alkaline seawater. As displayed in Figures S19,S20 (Supporting Information), the Ir–NC-2 catalyst continues to demonstrate remarkable HzOR catalytic efficiency, characterized by its ultralow working potential, small Tafel slope, and low *R*ct value compared to the other as-synthesized catalysts while also surpassing the benchmark Pt/C catalyst under alkaline seawater and alkaline simulated seawater conditions. This enhancement demonstrates the benefits of effectively decorating the NC matrix with an optimized weight percentage of Ir nanoclusters, leading to highly efficient electrocatalytic HzOR performance in both freshwater and seawater electrolyte solutions. Furthermore, the stability of the Ir–NC-2 in HzOR was evaluated through chronopotentiometry in 0.5 m N2H4 + seawater + 1 m KOH solution, as illustrated in Figure 4g. The working potential remained stable during the initial 25 h of constant HzOR at a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2. Nevertheless, across the extended 50-h electrolysis period, a decrease in working potential was observed. Notably, after refreshing the electrolyte solution, the working potential swiftly recovered, suggesting that the decay was owing to the depletion of N2H4 concentration. To further emphasize the outstanding stability of the Ir–NC-2 catalyst, we conducted comprehensive characterization post-stability tests, including XRD, XPS,

and SEM with EDS analyses. As illustrated in Figures S21–S23 (Supporting Information), the crystalline structure, morphology, and chemical composition of the Ir–NC-2 catalyst remained unchanged, confirming its robust stability. This finding also indicates the absence of electrochemical reconstruction in the Ir nanoclusters throughout the HzOR process. Moreover, the activity of the Ir–NC-2 catalyst was compared with previously described electrocatalysts for HzOR across different electrolytes, as shown in Figure [4h](#page-8-0) and summarized in Table S2 (Supporting Information). These comparisons show that the Ir–NC-2 catalyst ranks among the top catalysts for electrocatalytic HzOR across various electrolyte solutions. Collectively, these results reveal the amazing catalytic activity of the synthesized Ir–NC-2 catalyst in both HER and HzOR for alkaline, alkaline simulated seawater, and alkaline seawater solutions. Consequently, the Ir–NC-2 catalyst emerges as a greatly effective electrocatalyst for practical industrial seawater electrolysis applications.

#### **2.4. Dual-Functional Performance of Ir–NC-2 Catalyst for OHzS in Alkaline Seawater**

Considering the outstanding HER and HzOR performance of the Ir–NC-2 catalyst, we investigated its performance in OHzS and overall water splitting (OWS). A two-electrode electrolyzer was constructed with Ir–NC-2 catalysts serving as both cathode and anode (Ir–NC-2(−)ǀǀIr–NC-2(+)), alongside IrO2 and Pt/C serving as the anode and cathode (Pt/C(−)ǀǀIrO2(+)), correspondingly, for comparison. The performance of this system was assessed in 0.5 M N2H4 + 1 m KOH solution for OHzS and 1 M KOH solution for OWS. **Figure [5](#page-10-0)**a illustrates that the existence of hydrazine substantially decreases the potential window for the cell voltage, as observed in the LSV polarization curves of OHzS and OWS. This substantial decrease confirms OHzS as an energyefficient design. Particularly, in the OHzS system, cell voltages of only 0.12, 0.37, and 0.64 V are needed to attain the 10, 50, and 100 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> of current densities, respectively. However, the OWS system needs cell voltages of 1.71, 2.21, and 2.63 mV to reach similar current densities, as displayed in Figure [5b.](#page-10-0) Based on the exceptional efficiency of hydrazine-assisted H2 production, investigations were conducted on seawater electrolysis to validate the efficiency of emission-free and green hydrogen technologies. Figure S24 (Supporting Information) depicts the use of alkaline seawater and simulated seawater instead of alkaline freshwater electrolyte solutions for OHzS execution. This strategy not only provides insights into key aspects of seawater electrolysis but also optimizes structural productivity in incorporating hydrazine waste with H2 production, thereby transforming waste into a valuable resource. As displayed in Figure [5c,](#page-10-0) testing with (0.5 m N2H4 + 0.5 m NaCl + 1 m KOH consistently showed efficient activity similar to that in alkaline freshwater electrolytes. Conversely, in the existence of 0.5 m N2H4 + seawater + 1 m KOH electrolyte, the potential of the electrolyzer exhibited a slight increase, possibly owing to naturally occurring minerals in seawater. Subsequently, the OHzS activity of the Ir–NC-2(−)ǀǀIr–NC-2(+) electrolyzer notably surpassed that of the Pt/C(−)ǀǀIrO2(+) electrolyzer across different electrolytes, as shown in Figure S25 (Supporting Information). Notably, the electrocatalytic stability of the developed Ir–NC-2(−)ǀǀIr–NC-2(+) electrolyzer was examined at 10 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> in alkaline seawater solution via chronopotentiometry tests, as illustrated in Figure [5d.](#page-10-0) The results reveal only a slight rise in cell voltage following a 50-h stability test, ensuring the potential application of the Ir–NC-2 catalyst in industrial OHzS systems. Additionally, the constructed Ir–NC-2(−)ǀǀIr– NC-2(+) electrolyzer demonstrated excellent OHzS performance compared to previously developed electrocatalysts, as indicated in Table S3 (Supporting Information). To assess its potential for practical applications, the Ir–NC-2 catalyst was tested in a solardriven alkaline seawater OHzS electrolyzer using a commercial Si solar cell under natural sunlight. The solar cell provided an open-circuit potential of ≈0.513 V, enabling a high current density of ≈150 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> for hydrogen generation (Figure [5e\)](#page-10-0). Continuous bubbling at both the cathode and anode confirmed the feasibility of solar-energy-driven hybrid water splitting using the Ir-NC-2 catalyst. Based on the HER and HzOR findings, the underlying mechanism of the Ir-NC-2 catalysts is schematically represented in Figure [5f.](#page-10-0) For HER, the catalytic process occurs at the cathode, primarily following a two-electron reaction pathway to produce hydrogen. For HzOR, the adsorbed hydrazine on the catalyst surface undergoes a four-electron reaction pathway, resulting in nitrogen formation in the electrolyte solution. This combined process presents a promising strategy for developing an energy-efficient hydrogen production system by integrating hydrazine oxidation with water splitting.[\[57,58\]](#page-14-0)

#### **2.5. DFT Calculations of Ir–NC for HER and HzOR**

To elucidate the underlying reaction mechanisms of the anodic HzOR and cathodic HER, DFT calculations were performed to investigate the Ir–NC catalyst. **Figure 6**[a–d](#page-11-0) presents the DFT-optimized geometric structural models and corresponding charge density difference plots of the NC matrix and Ir–NC catalyst. Figure [6a](#page-11-0) shows the top and side views of the NC matrix, where N atoms are doped into the carbon structure by replacing C sites. The charge density difference of the NC matrix (Figure [6b\)](#page-11-0) reveals electron transfer from N atoms to C atoms. In Figure [6c,](#page-11-0) the DFT-optimized geometric crystal structure of the Ir–NC catalyst illustrates the effective attachment of Ir nanoclusters onto the NC matrix surface, facilitated by interactions with C atoms. The charge density difference plot in Figure [6d](#page-11-0) reveals significant charge redistribution within the NC matrix, caused by electronic interactions between the Ir nanoclusters and the NC matrix.[\[59\]](#page-14-0) This charge redistribution, resulting from the coupling of the NC matrix with the Ir nanoclusters, enhances the adsorption energy levels of key reaction intermediates, thereby improving the catalytic performance for both HzOR and HER.

As illustrated in Figure [6e](#page-11-0) and Figure S26 (Supporting Information), the partial density of states (PDOS) for Ir–NC catalyst, NC matrix, and Ir nanoclusters indicate contributions from the p orbitals of N and C and the d orbitals of Ir. Figure [6f](#page-11-0) displays the total density of states (TDOS) for the NC matrix, Ir nanoclusters, and Ir–NC catalyst. The Ir–NC catalyst displays a broader TDOS distribution within the Fermi level compared to both the NC matrix and Ir nanoclusters, indicating that the incorporation of Ir nanoclusters enhances the electrical conductivity of the Ir–NC catalyst by modifying the electronic structure of the NC matrix.

These modifications facilitate the charge transfer between active sites and surface-adsorbed intermediates, contributing to the exceptional catalytic activity of the Ir–NC catalyst in both the HzOR and HER processes. To assess the HER activity, the Gibbs free energy of hydrogen adsorption ( $\Delta G_{\rm H^*}$ ) on the electrocatalyst surface was calculated.  $^{[60]}$  A  $\Delta G_{\rm H^*}$  value close to zero suggests a more favorable hydrogen adsorption/desorption process. As shown in Figure 6g, the Gibbs free energy diagram reveals that the  $\Delta G_{\rm H^*}$  of the Ir–NC catalyst is -0.29 eV, which is closer to zero than the  $\Delta G_{\rm H^*}$  of the Ir nanocluster (-0.57 eV). This indicates that the Ir–

NC catalyst exhibits excellent  $H^*$  adsorption/desorption kinetics, enhancing HER performance. [61]

The HzOR mechanism was also investigated using DFT calculations. As depicted in Figure 6h, the stepwise Gibbs free energy diagram for hydrazine dehydrogenation, from  ${}^*N_2H_4$  to  ${}^*N_2({}^*N_2H_4 \rightarrow {}^*NHNH_2 \rightarrow {}^*NHNH \rightarrow {}^*NNH \rightarrow {}^*N_2)$ , was calculated for both the Ir nanoclusters and Ir–NC catalyst. [62] The adsorption energy of  ${}^*N_2H_4$  on the Ir–NC catalyst is more negative at -0.55 eV compared to -0.47 eV for the Ir nanocluster, indicating improved adsorption of hydrazine molecules and subsequent

catalytic oxidation upon the incorporation of Ir species. The ratedetermining step for the Ir–NC catalyst is the dehydrogenation from \*NNH→\*N2, which requires a lower activation energy barrier of 0.50 eV compared to 0.73 eV for the Ir nanocluster. This finding demonstrates the critical role of Ir sites in enhancing the HzOR performance of the Ir–NC catalyst. Overall, these findings clearly demonstrate that incorporating Ir nanoclusters onto the NC surface significantly enhances the anodic HzOR and cathodic HER activities of the Ir–NC catalyst.

#### **2.6. Zn–Hydrazine Battery Performance**

Inspired by the exceptional dual-functionality of the Ir–NC-2 catalyst in both HER and HzOR and its effectiveness in hydrazineassisted seawater electrolysis, we employed it to develop a Zn– Hz battery. In this setup, the Ir–NC-2 catalyst served as the cathode, while the Zn foil acted as the anode, separated by an anion-exchange membrane. The Zn–Hz battery performs as a hydrazine-assisted energy conversion device, producing H2 via HER during discharge and generating N2 through hydrazine electro-oxidation at the cathode during charging. Concurrently, Zn undergoes oxidation to Zn2<sup>+</sup> and reduction to Zn metal, facilitating electron transfer during both discharge and charge processes. The Ir–NC-2 catalyst was placed in a combined solution of 0.5 M hydrazine + 1 m KOH, while the Zn foil was dipped in a paired solution of 0.2 m zinc acetate + 1 m KOH, as shown in **Figure 7**[a.](#page-12-0) The open circuit voltage remained steady at 0.398 V for 1 h, illustrating the stability of the developed Zn–Hz device (Figure [7b\)](#page-12-0). Additionally, the performance efficiency of the

<span id="page-12-0"></span>**Figure 7.** Zn–Hz battery efficiency of Ir–NC-2 catalyst: a) schematic illustration of Zn–Hz battery, b) open circuit potential, c) galvanostatic discharge profiles measured at various current densities, d) polarization curves, and e) galvanostatic charge–discharge long-term cyclic stability test.

Zn–Hz battery was examined at distinct current densities from 0 to 15 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2, as displayed in Figure 7c. The findings reveal that the Zn–Hz battery is capable of sustaining constant discharge rated even at high current density. Furthermore, the Zn–Hz battery demonstrated beneficial rechargeability even after long-term discharge, demonstrating effective recharging capability. With a discharge voltage of 0.302 V and a charge voltage of 0.316 V at 0.4 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2, the energy effectiveness of the constructed Zn– Hz battery is estimated to exceed 95.5%. In Figure 7d, the robust feasibility of the Zn–Hz battery is further supported by minimal voltage gaps observed in the charge and discharge polarization curves, confirming its outstanding rechargeability. As shown in Figure S27 (Supporting Information), during discharge and charge investigations at constant current density, the discharge voltage gradually drops while the charge voltage increases with elevated currents, further demonstrating the feasibility of the rechargeable Zn–Hz battery. In addition, a cyclic stability efficiency evaluation of the Zn–Hz battery was conducted. The Zn– Hz battery indicates exceptional cyclic stability over 360 cycles (120 h) at 5 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> with minimal voltage shifts, as depicted in Figure 7e. These findings demonstrate superb cyclic stability of Zn–Hz battery under the applied conditions. Subsequent studies on the cyclic stability of the Ir–NC-2 catalyst were also conducted, as displayed in Figures S28–S30 (Supporting Information). XRD, SEM with EDS, and XPS studies reveal that the Ir–NC-2 catalyst maintains its crystal structure, original rhombic dodecahedron morphology, and chemical composition effectively, suggesting its exceptional long-term stability in the Zn–Hz battery application. The OHzS performance revealed that the Ir– NC-2 catalyst exhibited high hydrogen production when powered by an external source, such as an electrochemical workstation. However, relying on external power sources poses challenges for practical outdoor applications. To address this, we integrated the OHzS system with the Zn–Hz battery, creating a self-powered

hydrogen production system. In this system, hydrazine acts as both the energy source for the Zn–Hz battery and the reactant for OHzS. As shown in Figure S31 (Supporting Information), during the operation of this integrated system, hydrogen and nitrogen are continuously generated at the OHzS cathode and anode, respectively. This demonstrates the potential of the Zn–Hz battery to function effectively in a self-powered hydrogen production system, offering a promising solution for sustainable energy applications.

# **3. Conclusion**

Herein, a dual-functional catalyst containing Ir nanoclusters anchored on the NC matrix surface was rationally designed, revealing outstanding efficiency and long-term stability for alkaline seawater-assisted hydrazine splitting. The synthesized catalyst offers several advantages, including greater electrical conductivity, porous structure, high nitrogen content, and more active metal sites, which collectively enhance its electrocatalytic activity. Consequently, the ideal Ir–NC-2 catalyst demonstrates exceptional catalytic performance. It achieves an ultra-small operating potential of 23 mV versus RHE to achieve 10 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> in HzOR and shows remarkable HER efficiency with an extremely minimal overpotential of 24 mV at 10 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2, surpassing that of the benchmark Pt/C catalyst. As an effective dual-functional catalyst for energy-efficient electrolytic H2 production, the integrated hybrid seawater electrolysis, combining HER and HzOR using Ir–NC-2 as both cathode and anode electrodes, requires only a cell voltage of 0.37 V to accomplish 50 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> for OHzS. This is 2.28 V lower than that required for the corresponding OWS, showcasing its reliable stability for 50 h at 10 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2. DFT calculations reveal that anchoring Ir onto the NC matrix significantly optimizes the ΔGH\* for HER and reduces the free energy barrier for HzOR, thereby enhancing the catalytic activity for both reactions. Furthermore, the dual-functional Ir–NC-2 catalyst has been employed in hydrazine-assisted energy conversion devices, such as the Zn–Hz battery, achieving an ultrahigh energy efficiency of 95.5%, along with superb long-term cyclic stability demonstrated over 360 cycles at 5 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2, underscoring its practical application potential. This study provides an effective method for synthesizing and establishing highly active and stable catalysts for energy-efficient H2 generation through seawater electrolysis.

## **4. Experimental Section**

*Material and Chemicals*: Zinc rod (Zn, 99.99%), Pt/C (20 wt.% platinum on carbon black), and 2-methylimidazole (C4H6N2, 97%) were found from Alfa Aesar, USA. Potassium hydroxide (KOH, extra pure flakes, 93%), sodium chloride (NaCl, 99%), and ethyl alcohol (C2H5OH, HPLC grade, 99.9%) were bought from Daejung Chemicals, South Korea. Furthermore, 5 wt.% Nafion, hydrazine hydrate (N2H4·H2O, 50%–60%), and iridium(III) chloride hydrate (IrCl3·*x*H2O) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, USA. The seawater utilized in this study was collected from Haeundae Beach (Busan, South Korea). All the chemicals were utilized without further purification.

*Synthesis of ZIF-8*: The ZIF-8 material was synthesized using a rapid and simple PLAL approach. In this process, the authors utilized 2 methylimidazole as the organic ligand and a cleaned Zn metal rod as the metal source. The monochromatic laser Nd: YAG (Surelite-II) was employed in the PLAL approach with the following laser parameters: pulse duration of 7 ns, laser wavelength of 1064 nm, pulse repetition rate of 10 Hz, output energy of 100 mJ, and the distance between the focusing lens and Zn metal rod was ≈30 mm. Typically, 1.0 m 2-methylimidazole was well mixed with 10 mL of 1.0 m KOH solution in a 20 mL glass vial, and the Zn metal rod was immersed in this solution. Afterward, the Zn metal rod was ablated with a laser beam for 10 min, producing Zn ions and nanosized Zn particles within a plasma plume. These Zn ions reacted with the 2-methylimidazole solution mixture, producing a white colloidal suspension containing ZIF-8. The ZIF-8 colloidal suspension was washed and centrifuged with deionized water and ethanol to eliminate impurities. Finally, the obtained ZIF-8 material was dried at 60 °C for 12 h.

*Synthesis of NC Matrix*: The pyrolysis approach was utilized to synthesize the NC matrix. The as-synthesized ZIF-8 material was transferred into a ceramic boat, which was then inserted into a tube furnace. The material was subsequently heated to 900 °C at a rate of 5 °C min−<sup>1</sup> and maintained at this temperature for 3 h in an N2 atmosphere. Then, it was allowed to cool to room temperature. The resulting material was next rinsed with 3 m nitric acid at 100 °C for 1 h to eliminate any residual Zn species. Afterward, the material was several times washed with deionized water until the pH reached 7. Finally, the NC material was dried at 60 °C for 12 h.

*Synthesis of Ir-Decorated NC Matrix*: The Ir–NC catalyst was synthesized via a wet chemical method. First, 10 mg of NC matrix were ultrasonically dispersed in 10 mL of ethanol for 15 min in a 20 mL glass vial. Subsequently, various amounts of IrCl3.*x*H2O (2.5, 5, and 7.5 mg) were incorporated to the NC dispersion. The resulting mixture was after that heated at 85 °C for 5 h. The attained black material was collected, washed many times with ethanol, and dried at 60 °C for 12 h. Then, the resultant material was heated to 400 °C at a rate of 5 °C min<sup>−</sup>1, held at this temperature for 1 min in an N2 atmosphere, and then cooled to room temperature to obtain the Ir–NC catalyst.

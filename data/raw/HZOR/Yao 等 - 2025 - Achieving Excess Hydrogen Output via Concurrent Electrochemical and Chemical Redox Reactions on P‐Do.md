**Electrolytic hydrogen production is of great significance in energy conversion and sustainable development. Traditional electrolytic water splitting confronts high anode voltage with oxygen generation and the amount of hydrogen produced at cathode depends entirely on the quantity of electric charge input. Herein, excess hydrogen output can be achieved by constructing a spontaneous hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) coupled hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) system. For the hydrazine oxidation-assisted electrolyzer in this work, both the external input electrons and the electrons produced by spontaneous chemical redox reaction can reduce water, producing more hydrogen than traditional electrolytic water splitting system. The ultrafast kinetics of bifunctional P-doped Co-based catalysts plays a key role in the spontaneous feature of HzOR/HER redox reaction and low working voltage of hydrazine oxidation-assisted electrolyzer (12 mV@100 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2). Theoretical calculation results and ex situ/in situ spectra demonstrate that doped P could optimize electronic structure, regulate adsorption energy of intermediates, and thus endows catalysts with ultrafast kinetics. This work provides a new pathway for the development of spontaneous oxidation-assisted hydrogen production, to achieve excess hydrogen output via concurrent electrochemical and chemical redox reactions.**

**1. Introduction**

Hydrogen is an optimal clean energy resource on account of its advantages such as high energy density and zero-carbon content.[\[1\]](#page-11-0) Compared to other hydrogen production methods, electrolytic water splitting is the most environmentally friendly and sustainable strategy to generate green hydrogen.[\[2\]](#page-11-0) Unfortunately, high electricity consumption leads to high cost of electrolytic hydrogen production, hindering the commercial application.[\[3\]](#page-11-0) For traditional electrolytic water splitting, the sluggish four-electron oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at anode not only needs high-voltage input, but also generates O2 which might be mixed with H2 and results in explosion hazard.[\[4\]](#page-11-0) To reduce the cost of electrolytic hydrogen, excess hydrogen production is another effective strategy besides voltage reduce. The hydrogen yield at cathode completely depends on the amount of external input electrons, which needs 2 mole of electrons to get 1 mole of hydrogen according to the HER reaction equation.[\[5\]](#page-11-0) It means that obtaining more electrons for hydrogen generation with the same even low electricity consumption is one of the ways to reduce the cost of electrolytic hydrogen production.

Hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) attracts extensive research attention due to the ultralow theoretical and practical potentials.[\[6\]](#page-11-0) It is worth noting that HzOR (-0.33 V vs RHE) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER, 0 V vs RHE) can construct a

Scheme representation of b) conventional water electrolysis, c) hydrazine-assisted water electrolysis, d) spontaneous hydrazine-assisted H2 production (Electron transfer from the spontaneous chemical redox reaction of HzOR/HER results in the production of H2), and e) energy-saving hydrazine-assisted H2 production with excess yield (Concurrent electrochemical and chemical redox reactions lead to excess H2 output).

thermodynamic spontaneous system theoretically, owing to the negative potential gap with a value of -0.33 V. In other words, for an electrolytic hydrazine-assisted hydrogen evolution system, not only the external input electrons can generate hydrogen, but also electron transfer resulting from the spontaneous chemical redox reaction of HzOR/HER can be used for excess hydrogen generation (**Scheme 1**a). However, the above characteristic has not been integrated into electrolytic water splitting to promote hydrogen production. The fundamental reason is that the activities and reaction kinetics of catalysts are unsatisfactory. Due to the sluggish kinetics of catalysts, the thermodynamic spontaneous reaction of HzOR/HER cannot be carried out in practice. Consequently, developing high-activity catalysts with ultrafast kinetics is the precondition to exploit the unique advantages of spontaneous HzOR/HER system.

Up to now, various catalysts have been developed for HzOR and HER, including noble metals (Pt, Pd) and non-noble metal (Fe, Co, Ni, Cu) based catalysts.[\[3,4,7\]](#page-11-0) However, limited by the inappropriate electronic structure and improper adsorption energies of intermediates, the catalytic kinetics is still unsatisfied and the catalytic activity needs to be improved. Besides, designing efficient bifunctional catalysts for HzOR and HER through a facile and scalable synthetic method is significant to the practical application, while remains a challenge. Heteroatom doping has been considered as an effectual strategy to enhance the catalytic activity.[\[8\]](#page-11-0) Phosphorus is considered as a promising candidate to promote the electrochemical performance, which is widespread in nature.[\[9\]](#page-11-0) The physicochemical properties and electronic structure of catalysts can be modified after introducing P atoms, which further influences adsorption energies of intermediates.[\[8a,10\]](#page-11-0) Besides, it is believed that doped P can improve the reactivity of catalysts, which may meet the demand for faster reaction kinetics.[\[11\]](#page-11-0) However, the specific mechanism of P doping, as wells as the influence of doping on reaction kinetics need to be further explored.

Herein, P-doping Co-based composites were developed by facile electrodeposition and anodic oxidation methods as effective HER and HzOR catalysts, with low potentials of -81 and - 91 mV versus RHE at 100 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2, respectively. Remarkably, overall hydrazine splitting (OHzS) only requires -45 and 12 mV to reach 10 and 100 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2, superior to most reported catalysts. A flow electrolyzer with anion-exchange membrane confirms the potential for high current applications in industry (0.334 mV@0.5A cm<sup>−</sup>2). DFT calculations elucidate that the doped P can regulate electronic structure of active sites and optimize adsorptions of H and H2O, contributing to superior HER activity. In situ spectra results illustrate the excellent HzOR kinetics of P-Co/Co3O4/Co(OH)2 with the blue shift and intensity change of characteristic peaks. Thanks to the ultrafast kinetics of P-doped Co-based catalysts, a unique spontaneous hydrazine oxidationassisted electrolyzer is constructed successfully. Particularly, excess hydrogen can be produced due to the concurrent electrochemical and chemical redox reactions, which has never been reported in hydrazine oxidation-assisted water splitting. The Pdoping Co-based catalysts can also be applied to seawater electrolysis without chlorine-containing byproducts and other energysaving hydrogen production systems.

### **2. Results and Discussion**

### **2.1. Characterization of Catalysts**

The P-doped Co-based catalysts were in-situ grown on nickel foam (NF) substrate through facile electrodeposition methods.

P-Co/Co3O4 and P-Co/Co3O4/Co(OH)2 are used as HER and HzOR catalysts, respectively. P doping facilitates H2O adsorption and optimizes Gibbs free energy change of H (ΔGH\*). Due to the ultrafast kinetics of catalysts, a hydrazine oxidation-assisted electrolyzer with electrochemical process and spontaneous chemical redox can be successful constructed (Scheme [1a\)](#page-1-0), exporting more hydrogen than traditional electrolytic water splitting (Scheme [1e\)](#page-1-0).

To identify the components of HER catalyst, X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern and Raman spectrum were collected. **Figure 1**a,b reveals the existence of Co (JCPDS NO. 05–0727) and amorphous Co3O4. There are no characteristic peaks of phosphides and phosphates, implying that P was doped in the catalyst. Inductively coupled plasma (ICP) test further reveals that the mass ratio of P/Co in P-Co/Co3O4 is ≈4.15%, proving the existence of P element in catalyst (Table S1, Supporting Information). Fieldemission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements were performed to study microstructure of P-Co/Co3O4. As shown in Figures 1c,d, and S2 (Supporting Information), P-Co/Co3O4 is composed of numerous microparticles. Noticeably, the significantly different morphology of P-Co/Co3O4 and Co/Co3O4 (Figure S3, Supporting Information) suggesting the successful doping of P in P-Co/Co3O4. HzOR catalyst of P-Co/Co3O4/Co(OH)2 was fabricated by a sample electrochemical anodic oxidation strategy based on P-Co/Co3O4-100. XRD pattern in Figure 1a shows new diffraction peaks besides Co phase, which can be indexed to Co(OH)2 (JCPDS NO. 30–0443). ICP result demonstrates that the mass ratio of P/Co in P-Co/Co3O4/Co(OH)2 is ≈4.91%, which is close to that of P-Co/Co3O4 (Table S1, Supporting Information). FESEM (Figure 1e) and TEM (Figure 1f) images illustrates that there are abundant sheets after anodic oxidation, which

are the typical structures of hydroxide.[\[12\]](#page-11-0) Moreover, the highresolution TEM (HRTEM) images elucidate the formation of Co(OH)2. As shown in Figure [1g,h,](#page-2-0) the lattice fringe of 4.55 Å is matched with the (001) plane of Co(OH)2. To investigate the distribution of elements in P-Co/Co3O4/Co(OH)2, scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and corresponding elemental mapping images were collected. As shown in Figure [1i](#page-2-0) and Figure S6 (Supporting Information), the Co, O, and P elements uniformly distribute over the block region which is considered as P-Co/Co3O4, while the sheets structure considered as Co(OH)2 on the upper left corner has almost no distribution of P. Figure S7a–e (Supporting Information) are the enlarged STEM and elemental mapping images of the sheets structure, which are coincident with the above results. Besides, the energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) of the sheets structure exhibits that the ratio of Co/O is 1/2 approximately, similar to the chemical formula of Co(OH)2 (Figure S7f–h, Supporting Information).

To reveal the surface chemical composition and valence states of catalysts, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses were performed. The full survey XPS spectrum of P-Co/Co3O4 in Figure S8a (Supporting Information) shows the existence of Co, P, and O. For the high-resolution Co 3d spectrum (**Figure 2**a), peak at 777.44 eV agrees with Co0. [\[13\]](#page-11-0) Besides, the characteristic peaks of Co<sup>3</sup><sup>+</sup> and Co<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> can be observed as well, coincident with the results of XRD and Raman spectrum.[\[14\]](#page-11-0) In the O 1s spectrum (Figure S8b, Supporting Information), peak at 532.90 eV is assigned to the hydroxyl species of adsorbed H2O, and the peaks at 528.90 and 531.02 eV are attributed to the lattice O<sup>2</sup><sup>−</sup>, which face two different environments in Co3O4. [\[15\]](#page-11-0) The highresolution P 2p spectrum exhibits a typical peak of P-Co bonding mode at 129.33 eV (Figure S8c, Supporting Information).[\[10b\]](#page-11-0)

Interestingly, the characteristic peak of Co0 in P-Co/Co3O4 shows negative shifts compared with that of Co/Co3O4 (Figure [2a\)](#page-3-0), suggesting the strong electron manipulation effect after P doping, which can optimize the electronic structure and regulate the adsorption energy of intermediates.[\[16\]](#page-11-0) Besides, the XPS spectra of P-Co/Co3O4/Co(OH)2 were collected as well. In the Co 3d spectrum of P-Co/Co3O4/Co(OH)2, there are no typical peaks of Co0 by direct detection (Figure S10b, Supporting Information), while the peaks at 777.73 and 792.56 eV assigned to Co° can be detected after etching (Figure S11b, Supporting Information). The abovementioned results imply that the surface of catalyst is covering by Co(OH)2 after electrochemical anodic oxidation process. To investigate the orbital transition and electronic structure of P-Co/Co3O4/Co(OH)2, soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy (sXAS) was conducted. Figure [2b](#page-3-0) exhibits the O K-edge sXAS spectra of P-Co/Co3O4/Co(OH)2 and Co/Co3O4/Co(OH)2. The peaks could be attributed to O 2p orbital hybridized with Co 3d orbital.[\[17\]](#page-11-0) Obviously, the lower peaks intensity for P-Co/Co3O4/Co(OH)2 illustrates an increased electron occupation of Co 3d state, suggesting that the electrons of Co are more abundant after P doping.[\[18\]](#page-11-0) Besides, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) results are exhibited in Figure [2c.](#page-3-0) Compared with Co/Co3O4/Co(OH)2, the valence band is shifted away from the Fermi level after P doping, indicating the electronic regulation in d states which is beneficial to intermediates adsorption/desorption.[\[19\]](#page-11-0)

To conduct in-depth study of the electronic and structural properties of catalysts, X-ray absorption fine spectroscopy (XAFS) was adopted. Figure [2d](#page-3-0) shows the Co K-edge X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectra of P-Co/Co3O4 and P-Co/Co3O4. Noticeably, P-Co/Co3O4 exhibits a lower absorption edge than that of Co/Co3O4, suggesting that the oxidation state of Co element decreases after P doping. The Fourier transform extended X-ray absorption fine structure (FT-EXAFS) results with k3-weighted of Co K-edge are shown in Figure [2e.](#page-3-0) According to the fitting results in Table S2 (Supporting Information), the intense scattering peak of Co K-edge for P-Co/Co3O4 corresponds to the scattering path of Co-Co. Specially, the Co-Co scattering distance and the coordination number of P-Co/Co3O4 are smaller than those of Co/Co3O4 and Co foil, confirming the effect of doping on catalyst structure. In addition, P-Co/Co3O4/Co(OH)2 and Co/Co3O4/Co(OH)2 have the similar results as above (Figure [2f,g;](#page-3-0) Table S2, Supporting Information). Figure [2h](#page-3-0) shows the contour plots of Co K-edge wavelet transform EXAFS (WT-EXAFS), illustrating the main component of catalysts is Co metal. The XAFS results agree with XPS and sXAS spectra, indicating that the doped P can regulate electronic structure of active sites, thus can optimize adsorption energy of intermediates and enhance catalytic performance.

#### **2.2. Electrocatalytic HER Performance**

The electrochemical HER performance was measured in 1.0 M KOH by a traditional three-electrode system. The electrodeposition time of P-Co/Co3O4 was determined to be 900 s due to the optimum HER activity (Figure S19, Supporting Information). The HER polarization curves in **Figure [3](#page-5-0)**a demonstrate that P-Co/Co3O4 has the most superior HER activity. To reach the current density of 10 and 100 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2, P-Co/Co3O4 requires ultralow overpotentials of -13 and -81 mV, which are lower than that of Co/Co3O4 (-210 and -249 mV), NF (-259 and -377 mV), and benchmark Pt/C (-36 and -91 mV). Besides, P-Co/Co3O4 exhibits the smallest Tafel slope of 43 mV dec<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> as shown in Figure [3b,](#page-5-0) indicating the favorable HER kinetics via Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism. Furthermore, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) tests were carried out and transfer resistances (*R*ct) of P-Co/Co3O4 and Co/Co3O4 were calculated to be 8 and 41 Ω cm<sup>−</sup>2, respectively (Figure [3c;](#page-5-0) Figure S20, Supporting Information). The smaller *R*ct suggests the important effect of P doping in accelerating the charge transfer kinetics. Stability was evaluated by chronopotentiometry test. As shown in Figure [3d](#page-5-0) and P-Co/Co3O4 can stably catalyze for 120 h while benchmark Pt/C shows apparent performance degradation. Meanwhile, the XRD pattern, Raman result, SEM images, XPS spectra, and XAFS results (Figures S21–S24, Supporting Information) for P-Co/Co3O4 after HER test remain unchanged, implying that the electrocatalyst has great composition and structural.

#### **2.3. Electrocatalytic HzOR Performance**

HzOR electrocatalyst P-Co/Co3O4/Co(OH)2 was obtained through a partial electrochemical oxidation method for P-Co/Co3O4-100. The electrochemical HzOR performance was evaluated in 1.0 M KOH and 0.33 M N2H4. Impressively, the potentials of P-Co/Co3O4/Co(OH)2 at 10 and 100 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> are -108 and -91 mV versus RHE, respectively, which are much lower than that of P-Co/Co3O4-100 (-84 and -74 mV versus RHE), Co/Co3O4/Co(OH)2 (-3 and 40 mV versus RHE), Co/Co3O4-100 (-55 and 7 mV versus RHE), NF (705 and 970 mV versus RHE), and RuO2 (584 and 753 mV versus RHE) (Figure [3e\)](#page-5-0). The OER polarization curve of P-Co/Co3O4/Co(OH)2 in 1.0 M KOH was recorded in Figure S26 (Supporting Information). Benefiting from the favorable theoretical oxidation potential of HzOR and the outstanding HzOR activity of P-Co/Co3O4/Co(OH)2, the potential at 100 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> sharply drops by 1.733 V after adding N2H4 in electrolyte. The results demonstrate that the replacement of OER with HzOR and the development of active HzOR catalyst are beneficial to achieving ultralow anode potential. As shown in Figure [3f,](#page-5-0) the corresponding Tafel slope of P-Co/Co3O4/Co(OH)2 is only 15 mV dec<sup>−</sup>1, indicating the excellent HzOR reaction kinetics. Specifically, the electrocatalytic activity of P-Co/Co3O4/Co(OH)2 is superior to other reported HzOR electrocatalysts (Figure [3g;](#page-5-0) Table S3, Supporting Information). To our knowledge, P-Co/Co3O4/Co(OH)2 exhibits lowest HzOR potential under alkaline condition in lager current density (≥100 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2). A smaller *R*ct for P-Co/Co3O4/Co(OH)2 with the value of 0.32 Ω cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> demonstrates the importance of P doping in facilitating charge transfer (Figure S27, Supporting Information). The SCN<sup>−</sup> poison tests show that Co3O4 and Co(OH)2 are the important active components for alkaline HzOR (Figure S28, Supporting Information).[\[20\]](#page-11-0) Chronopotentiometry test was carried out to study the stability of P-Co/Co3O4/Co(OH)2 at a constant current density of 100 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> (Figure [3h\)](#page-5-0). Due to the gradual depletion of N2N4, the original electrolyte was replaced every 20 h with a fresh electrolyte (1.0 M KOH + 0.33 M N2H4). In each cycle, the HzOR potentials increase due to the consumption of N2H4 rather than the deactivation of catalyst. It

is obvious that the HzOR potentials can restore after changing new electrolyte and the catalyst can operate over 80 h. The unchanged XRD pattern, Raman result, SEM image, XPS spectra, and XAFS results (Figures S29–S33, Supporting Information) indicate that P-Co/Co3O4/Co(OH)2 is durable in HzOR process.

#### **2.4. Electrocatalytic OHzS Performance**

Considering the excellent HER and HzOR performance of the obtained electrocatalysts, a hydrazine oxidation-assisted hydrogen production electrolyzer was assembled using P-Co/Co3O4 and P-Co/Co3O4/Co(OH)2 as cathode and anode in a singlechamber electrolytic cell. The OHzS system of P-Co/Co3O4|| P-Co/Co3O4/Co(OH)2 only requires -45 and 12 mV to reach 10 and 100 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2, which is superior to Co/Co3O4|| Co/Co3O4/Co(OH)2 (24 and 425 mV) and benchmark Pt/C || RuO2 (330 and 930 mV) in **Figure 4**[a.](#page-6-0) Noticeably, the outstanding OHzS activity of P-Co/Co3O4|| P-Co/Co3O4/Co(OH)2 is significantly superior to those of reported electrocatalysts in Figure [4b](#page-6-0) and Table S4 (Supporting Information). Figure [4c](#page-6-0) shows the comparation of OHzS and OWS. A distinct activity improvement of 1.695 V at 100 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> can be observed, illustrating the superiority of the hydrazine oxidation thermodynamics. Moreover, Figure [4d](#page-6-0) exhibits that the P-Co/Co3O4 || P-Co/Co3O4/Co(OH)2 couple have stable catalysis ability over 80 h. The radar chart in Figure [4e](#page-6-0) distinctly highlights the remarkable activity of Pdoped Co-based catalysts. The remarkable electrocatalytic performance of P-Co/Co3O4|| P-Co/Co3O4/Co(OH)2 could be attributed to the electron manipulation and ultrafast catalytic kinetics due to P doping. To further evaluate the practical significance of P-doped Co-based catalysts with ultrafast kinetics, two-electrode flow electrolyzer with anion-exchange membrane was constructed (Figure [4f\)](#page-6-0), using P-Co/Co3O4 and P-Co/Co3O4/Co(OH)2 as cathode and anode, respectively. Figure [4g](#page-6-0) demonstrates that two-electrode flow electrolyzer requires about 0.334 and 0.538 V to reach 500 and 800 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2, respectively. Besides, a 225 h stability test at 500 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> without *iR*

correction shows the durability of two-electrode flow electrolyzer (Figure [4h\)](#page-6-0). Subsequently, the electricity expense of two-electrode flow electrolyzer coupled with HzOR and HER using P-doped Cobased catalysts is calculated and the value is only 0.80 kWh per m<sup>3</sup> H2@500 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2. Noticeably, the corresponding electricity expense in this work is lower than the theoretical limit of OWS, which is at least 2.94 kWh per m3 H2. [\[4b\]](#page-11-0) The aforementioned results elucidate the possibility of P-doped Co-based catalysts in practical applications.

### **2.5. Electrocatalytic Mechanism**

To investigate the influence of P doping on catalytic activity, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were conducted. As can be seen in the charge density difference analysis of P-Co/Co3O4, the doped P demonstrates an obvious tendency to lose electrons and the delocalized electrons accumulate around adjacent Co-P bonds, which is different from Co/Co3O4 (**Figure 5**[a\)](#page-8-0). Besides, there are redistribution of electrons between the interface of Co and Co3O4. The strong electron manipulation is favorable for P-Co/Co3O4 to interact with H atom, which has unsaturated electrons in 1s orbital.[\[21\]](#page-11-0) Moreover, ΔGH\* was calculated to study the adsorption/desorption ability of intermediate for active sites. As shown in Figure [5b,](#page-8-0) compared with Co3 site of Co/Co3O4 (- 0.67 eV), Co3 site of P-Co/Co3O4 exhibits the closest ΔGH\* to zero (-0.31 eV), indicating that P doping can alleviate the excessive H adsorption energy and benefits to the desorption process. To further study the effect of P in HER, ΔGH\* on P site of P-Co/Co3O4 was calculated and the value is 1.01 eV, much bigger than that of Co3 site, implying the deficient H adsorption ability. As shown in the projected density of states (PDOS) of active sites (Figure [5c\)](#page-8-0), there are more abundant electrons near the Fermi level (EF), indicating the electronic structure regulation of P doping. The above results indicate that the doped P is not the direct active site for H adsorption, but plays an important role electron manipulation to optimize the H adsorption energy. In alkaline electrolyte, water absorption is the precondition of HER due to the insufficiency of H<sup>+</sup>. [\[22\]](#page-11-0) Figure [5d](#page-8-0) shows that P-Co/Co3O4 (-0.46 eV) has a larger water adsorption energy than that of Co/Co3O4 (-0.31 eV). Besides, the Co-O bond length between Co site in catalyst and O atom in absorbed water of P-Co/Co3O4 and Co/Co3O4 is 2.16 and 2.22 Å, respectively, proving the stronger water adsorption ability after P doping. DFT calculation results suggest that the doped P can not only regulate the electronic structure as illustrated in XPS results, but also optimize ΔGH\* and facilitate water adsorption, resulting to the acceleration of HER kinetics (Figure [5e\)](#page-8-0).[\[16,23\]](#page-11-0)

HzOR process on P-Co/Co3O4/Co(OH)2 was analyzed by a serious of in-situ techniques. As in situ Raman spectra shown in Figure [5f,](#page-8-0) several peaks at about 190, 470, 510, and 670 cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> are detected, which can be assigned to the F2g, Eg, F2g, and A1g phonon modes of Co3O4. [\[14,24\]](#page-11-0) These typical peaks of Co3O4 exist at different potentials, suggesting the excellent stability of catalyst during HzOR. Specially, compared to the initial state, pronounced blue shifts of Raman signals occurs with the change of potentials, implying the fast response of catalyst to voltage (Figure [5f,g;](#page-8-0) Figure S34, Supporting Information). According to the previous studies, blue shift usually represents lattice contraction, charge redistribution, or crystallinity decrease.[\[24,25\]](#page-11-0) Consequently, the in situ Raman results with blue shifts indicate the fast and continuous interaction between catalyst and intermediates under voltage. It is worth noting that no obvious Raman peak shifts can be detected for Co/Co3O4/Co(OH)2 (Figures S37 and S38, Supporting Information). Besides, a decrease of A1g mode can be observed after OCP in Figure [5h,](#page-8-0) implying the weak disorder of structure.[\[26\]](#page-11-0) The amorphous character of Co3O4 might be conducive to the flexible regulation of the active structure during catalytic process, resulting to the favorable reaction kinetics.[\[27\]](#page-11-0) Moreover, in situ surface-enhanced infrared (SEIR) spectroscopy was carried out to explore the evolution of intermediates. The real-time SEIR spectra and corresponding contour plot shown in Figure [5i,j](#page-8-0) illustrate that several peaks at 1338, 1509, 1544, and 1680 cm<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> are detected, which can be ascribed to NH2, -H-NH, -NH, and N-H modes of HzOR intermediates on the surface of P-Co/Co3O4/Co(OH)2. [\[28\]](#page-11-0) At first, the intensity of peaks becomes stronger with the increase of time, meaning the accumulation of reaction intermediates during HzOR process. During the test, the HzOR process tended to be stable gradually. Therefore, the peak strength remained relatively constant during the late stages of the test. The in situ SEIR spectra at various voltages exhibit the similar results as shown in Figure S39 (Supporting Information), which confirms our above analysis. Additionally, in situ EIS measurements (Figure S40, Supporting Information) were conducted to study the catalytic process. Bode plots of P-Co/Co3O4/Co(OH)2 have smaller phase peak angle in the low-frequency region than that of Co/Co3O4/Co(OH)2, proving the superior interaction between catalyst and electrolyte, as well as the more favorable charge transfer process after P doping.[\[29\]](#page-11-0) Besides, the smaller charge transfer resistance of P-Co/Co3O4/Co(OH)2 indicates the faster adsorption kinetics during HzOR.[\[29a\]](#page-11-0) The above in situ spectral results show that the P-doped catalyst has great HzOR activity. In addition, the HzOR activity of P-Co/Co3O4/Co(OH)2 is superior than that of P-Co/Co3O4-100, which may due to the nanoscale restructuring. As shown in Figure [1c–f,](#page-2-0) abundant nanosheets were formed on the surface of the sample after electrochemical anodic oxidation process, which were confirmed to be Co(OH)2. The Brunauer-Emitter-Teller (BET) results (Figure S41, Supporting Information) suggest that P-Co/Co3O4/Co(OH)2 has larger specific surface area than P-Co/Co3O4-100. Contact angle measurements (Figure S42, Supporting Information) were performed to evaluate the hydrophilia of catalysts. The contact angle of P-Co/Co3O4-100 is 27.4°. While for P-Co/Co3O4/Co(OH)2, the water drops immersed immediately, demonstrating the remarkable wettability after the formation of Co(OH)2 on surface. The structural transformation from particles with smooth surfaces to nanosheets on surface can increase the surface area and optimize the hydrophilia of catalysts, leading to the enhancement in current density.[\[30\]](#page-11-0)

#### **2.6. Spontaneous Chemical Redox and Excess Hydrogen Output**

The advantages of a spontaneous hydrazine oxidation-assisted electrolyzer with excess hydrogen output via concurrent electrochemical and chemical redox are illustrated in **Figure 6**[a.](#page-9-0) Theoretical analysis and experimental evidence are demonstrated as follow. Theoretically, there is a negative potential gap with the

value of -0.33 V between HzOR and HER even in the electrolyte with same pH (Figure [6b\)](#page-9-0).[\[31\]](#page-11-0) Thanks to the excellent catalytic active and ultrafast reaction kinetics of P-doped Co-based catalysts, a negative potential gap of -108 mV is existed practically between alkaline HzOR and HER, which is shown in the red highlight region of Figure [6c.](#page-9-0) Even at the current density of 100 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2, the potential of HzOR is still more negative than that of HER (the potential gap is -7 mV), while the OER potential is much higher than that of HER on account of the sluggish kinetics (the positive potential gap is 1.693 V). According to the above theoretical and

experimental results, a unique spontaneous hydrazine oxidationassisted electrolyzer with concurrent electrochemical and chemical redox reactions can be constructed due to the contribution of the negative potential gap.

Consequently, P-Co/Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> and P-Co/Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> were integrated into a two-electrode flow cell, as shown in Figure S43a (Supporting Information). As shown in Figure S43b (Supporting Information), the open circuit potential (OCP) is  $\approx 0.22 \text{ V}$  of HzOR/HER system. The polarization curve and corresponding power density curve with the maximum power density of 2.2 mW cm<sup>-2</sup> (Figure S44a, Supporting Information) verify the feasibility of thermodynamic spontaneous HzOR/HER system. Besides, a Zn-H<sub>2</sub>O battery was assembled with a maximum power density of 6.3 mW cm<sup>-2</sup> (Figure S44b, Supporting Information), owing to the excellent HER performance of P-Co/Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>. In order to further verify the spontaneity of the proposed HzOR/HER system, i-t tests at 0 V were carried out in a H-type electrochemical cell separated by anion-exchange membrane. As shown in Figure 6d, there is a continuous current output with the range of 4.5–2.5 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, using P-Co/Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> in 1.0 M KOH and 0.33 M N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> as anode compartment and P-Co/Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> in 1.0 M KOH as cathode compartment. The decrease of current density is due to the consumption of N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>. Besides, the bubbles on both anode and cathode electrodes prove that the reaction occurs spontaneously (Inserts in Figure 6d; Video S1, Supporting Information). However, the current almost disappears when the

P-Co/Co3O4/Co(OH)2 is replaced by carbon rod or without N2H4 in anode compartment (Figure [6e\)](#page-9-0). The above results demonstrate that P-doped Co-based catalysts with ultrafast reaction kinetics can successfully achieve a spontaneous chemical redox process, which can produce hydrogen without external electrons input.

The unique spontaneity of this system suggests that chemical redox process could concurrently occur when electrolyzed. Consequently, the produced hydrogen comes not only from electrolysis, but also from spontaneous chemical redox reactions. In order to prove the increase in hydrogen production, the hydrogen produced at cathode chamber of OHzS and OWS systems was measured by drainage method in a H-typy electrochemical cell separated by anion-exchange membrane (Figure S45, Supporting Information). As shown in Figure [6f,g,](#page-9-0) the slope of fitted curve is the ratio of hydrogen production to time. Apparently, the slope of OHzS is larger than that of OWS, suggesting the larger hydrogen production. An shown in Figure S46 (Supporting Information), faradaic efficiency of OHzS and OWS are 104.1% and 97.5%, respectively. The Faradaic efficiency of OHzS is higher than that of traditional OWS, indicating the excess hydrogen output due to the spontaneous chemical redox reaction of OHzS in this work, which are consistent with the results in Figure [6f,g.](#page-9-0) Notably, for traditional electrolytic water splitting, Faraday efficiency over 100% is abnormal. However, although the homemade gas collection setup may have air tightness issues, the Faradaic efficiency for hydrogen production of OHzS is still over 100%, which indicates the presence of concurrent electrochemical and chemical redox reactions in this OHzS.

Importantly, the spontaneous chemical redox reaction is not affected by electrochemical process, which means that the excess hydrogen can be produced even at industrial current densities of electrolytic water splitting. The high current density is the premise of promoting the industrialization of electrolytic hydrogen production. Second, the spontaneous chemical redox reaction produce hydrogen at cathode, which is on the same side as hydrogen produced by electrolytic water splitting. Therefore, the excess hydrogen can be easily collected and used. The above characteristics make the strategy of excess hydrogen output proposed in this paper suitable for practice.

#### **2.7. Energy-Saving Electrolytic Hydrogen Production**

High energy consumption is the main issue of electrolytic hydrogen production.[\[4a\]](#page-11-0) Fortunately, the ultrafast kinetics and excellent HER and HzOR catalytic performance allow P-doped Cobased catalysts to reduce the cost of hydrogen production through multiple ways. Seawater electrolysis is a promising and long-term technology instead of freshwater electrolysis due to the water distribution and resource shortage issues.[\[32\]](#page-11-0) However, some difficulties hinder the practical development of seawater electrolysis such as the toxic chlorine oxidation reaction (ClOR) under high potential.[\[2a,33\]](#page-11-0) Fortunately, given the excellent catalytic performance and ultralow electrolytic potential, ClOR is expected to be avoided in seawater electrolysis using P-doped Co-based catalysts.[\[34\]](#page-11-0) Consequently, 1.0 M KOH simulated seawater and 1.0 M KOH + 0.33 M N2H4 simulated seawater were used as cathodic and anodic electrolyte, respectively. Figure S48a,b (Supporting Information) exhibit that Cl<sup>−</sup> will not interfere the HER catalytic performance of P-Co/Co3O4.

As shown in Figure S48c,d (Supporting Information), the HzOR polarization curve of P-Co/Co3O4/Co(OH)2 in alkaline simulated seawater is consistent with that without NaCl, with the potential of -106 and -92 mV at 10 and 100 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2, as well as a Tafel slope of 11 mV dec<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> (Figure S48e, Supporting Information). Moreover, a two-electrode electrolyzer in alkaline simulated seawater was assembled using P-Co/Co3O4 as cathode and P-Co/Co3O4/Co(OH)2 as anode. The OHzS polarization curve is unchanged after adding NaCl in electrolyte. Figure S48f (Supporting Information) also exhibits that the catalytic activity of P-Co/Co3O4 || P-Co/Co3O4/Co(OH)2 couple is superior to that of benchmark Pt/C || RuO2 couple. Apparently, attributing to the excellent performance of the obtained electrocatalysts, the OHzS system can reach the high current density at a potential much lower than that of chlorine oxidation, which is expected to be applied to the industrial electrolytic seawater. Thanks to the ultralow operating voltage of P-Co/Co3O4 || P-Co/Co3O4/Co(OH)2-based OHzS system, spent AA battery could be utilize to assemble with this hydrogen production electrolyzer. As shown in Figure S49 and Video S2 (Supporting Information), a spent AA battery with an operating voltage of 1.17 V can readily drive the OHzS system and a large number of bubbles can be observed around the electrodes, not only contributing to economic hydrogen production, but also affording the possibility to recycle the spent battery with low voltage. Besides, the OHzS system can also be drove by a commercial solar panel with 1.5 V operating voltage in the sunlight (Figure S50 and Video S3, Supporting Information). This solar cell-powered hydrogen production system realizes the conversion of solar energy to hydrogen energy with low energy consumption.

## **3. Conclusion**

In this work, electrolytic voltage reduction and excess hydrogen output are realized simultaneously to reduce the cost of electrolytic hydrogen. Excellent bifunctional P-doped Co-based catalysts were fabricated with low HER overpotential of -81 mV and HzOR potential of -91 mV versus RHE at 100 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2. The OHzS only needs 12 mV to reach 100 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2, exceeding the previous reported catalysts. Impressively, thanks to the ultrafast catalytic kinetics, a spontaneous hydrazine oxidation-assistance electrolyzer can be constructed. The spontaneous chemical redox process occurs simultaneously when electrolyzed, giving excess hydrogen output. Experimental results and DFT studies demonstrate that P doping can manipulate electronic structure and optimize adsorption energy of intermediates, contributing to the outstanding catalytic activity. This work helps to understand the effect of doping on catalytic activity, and paves a new avenue for electrolytic water splitting to produce excess hydrogen owing to the spontaneous chemical redox process.

# Behavior of Palladium Nanoparticles in the Absence or Presence of Cobalt Tetraaminophthalocyanine for the Electrooxidation of Hydrazine

Audacity Maringa[a] and Tebello Nyokong\*[a]

Abstract: We report on the electrodeposition of palladium nanoparticles (PdNPs) on a glassy carbon electrode (GCE) and onto a poly-CoTAPc-GCE (CoTAPc=cobalt tetraamino phthalocyanine) surface. The electrodes are denoted as PdNPs-GCE and PdNPs/poly-CoTAPc-GCE, respectively. PdNPs/poly-CoTAPc-GCE showed the best activity for the oxidation of hydrazine at the lowest potential of -0.28 V and with the highest currents. The results were further supported by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) which showed that there was less resistance to charge transfer for PdNPs/poly-CoTAPc-GCE compared to PdNPs-GCE. The catalytic rate constant for hydrazine oxidation was 6.12 -108 cm3mol-1 s <sup>1</sup> using PdNPs/poly-CoTAPc-GCE.

## 1 Introduction

Metal nanoparticles play an important role in improving the electrochemical detection of analytes [1–10]. This is due to their unique physical and chemical properties. These properties can be enhanced by controlling the size, shape, the nature of the surface and distance between nanoparticles during the synthesis process. Electrochemical synthesis is the method of choice since it is simple and reproducible.

Metal nanoparticles have been immobilized in polyaniline [1, 11–13] resulting in improved electrocatalytic activity. Palladium nanoparticles (PdNPs) are employed in this work since they are readily electrodeposited on glassy carbon electrode (GCE) [14], and they show high catalytic activity towards hydrazine oxidation [15–22]. This work reports on the improvement in the oxidation potential and detection limits for the detection of hydrazine when PdNPs are combined with phthalocyanines.

Metallophthalocyanines (MPcs) are excellent electrocatalysts due to their high thermal and chemical stability, coupled with their extensive redox chemistry [23]. MPcs however catalyze hydrazine oxidation at high potentials. Thus when both MPcs and PdNPs are employed to modify electrodes, an improvement in the electrocatalysis is expected due to synergistic effect. In this work, cobalt tetraaminophthalocyanine (CoTAPc) was chosen because it readily electropolymerizes on GCE [24] to form poly-CoTAPc-GCE. CoTAPc is a well-known electrocatalyst [24]. Pd nanoparticles (PdNPs) were then electrodeposited onto poly-CoTAPc-GCE to form PdNPs/poly-CoTAPc-GCE. PdNPs deposited on the bare electrode were also explored and the electrode is represented as PdNPs-GCE. Scheme 1 shows a summary of the modification of the glassy carbon electrode. Metal nanoparticles such as gold have been stabilized with thiol or amino phthalocyanines, and used to modify electrodes for detection of analytes such as bisphenol A, hydrazine or cytochrome c [25–27]. In the reported work, the nanoparticles were synthesized by chemical methods, and then chemically linked to phthalocyanines, followed by adsorption of the conjugates onto the electrodes. In the current work, the PdNPs are formed by electrodeposition onto a glassy carbon electrode instead of making them separately using the chemical methods. The CoTAPc will then be electropolymerized onto the glassy carbon electrode (poly-CoTAPc-GCE) followed by electrodeposition of PdNPs (PdNPs/poly-CoTAPc-GCE). Even though phthalocyanines have been used in the presence of gold nanoparticles, the use phthalocyanine in the presence of PdNPs for detection of analytes is reported for the first time in this work.

Hydrazine was employed as the test analyte because it is a carcinogenic and hepatotoxic substance which affects the liver and the brain glutathione [28].

from Merck. Aqueous solutions were prepared using Millipore water from Milli-Q-Water Systems (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA, USA). A solution of 1 mM hydrazine was prepared in Millipore water. A pH 8 buffer solution was prepared from KH2PO4 and K2HPO4. CoTAPc was synthesized as reported in literature [29].

#### 2.2 Equipment

Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images were obtained using a JOEL JSM 840 scanning electron microscope. Glassy carbon plates (GCP, Goodfellow, UK) of 1 - 1 cm and 2 mm thick were used as substrates for SEM. XPS analysis was done using an AXIS Ultra DLD, with Al (monochromatic) anode equipped with a charge neutralizer, supplied by Kratos Analytical.

All electrochemical experiments were performed using Autolab potentiostat PGSTAT 302 (Eco Chemie, Utrecht, The Netherlands) driven by the general purpose Electrochemical System data processing software (GPES, software version 4.9). A three electrode electrochemical cell comprising a glassy carbon electrode (GCE) as working, platinum wire (Pt) as counter and (AgjAgCl, 3 M KCl) reference electrodes was employed.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements were performed using Autolab FRA software, between 0.1 Hz and 10 kHz, with signal amplitude of 10 mV, in 2 mM ferricyanide solution containing 1 mM KCl, at the half-wave potential of 0.21 V. A nonlinear least squares (NNLS) method based on the EQUIVCRT program was used for automatic fitting of the obtained EIS data

### 2.3 Electrode Preparation and Modification

The glassy carbon electrode surface was polished using silicon carbide grinding paper (grit 1200) followed by polishing on a Buehler-felt pad using alumina (0.05 mm). Between each polishing step, absolute ethanol was used to remove any impurity by sonicating for 5 min. The electrode was then rinsed with Millipore water and dried under N2 stream.

Electropolymerization (50 cycles) was used to modify the glassy carbon electrode (GCE) with CoTAPc, following literature methods [30], denoted as poly-CoTAPc. Separately palladium nanoparticles were electrodeposited on to the GCE using cyclic voltammetry scanning from -0.4 V to 0.6 V in a deaerated solution containing 1 mM PdCl2 (0.1 M HCl) at a scan rate of 50 mV/s for 10 scans, using modified literature procedure [31]. The electrode is denoted as PdNPs-GCE. PdNPs were also electrodeposited on top of the poly-CoTAPc and the electrode is denoted PdNPs/poly-CoTAPc-GCE. In summary, the electrodes employed in this work are poly-CoTAPc-GCE, PdNPs-GCE, and PdNPs/poly-CoTAPc-GCE, Scheme 1.

# 3 Results and Discussions

# 3.1 Characterization of the Modified Electrodes

Electrodes where CoTAPc was electropolymerized on PdNPs-GCE gave irreproducible results hence are not included in this work as observed for other nanoparticles [32]. The electropolymerization of CoTAPc was carried out as reported in literature [30, 33, 34].

# 3.1.1 SEM

Figure 1 shows the SEM images of PdNPs and PdNPs/ poly-CoTAPc. PdNPs can be clearly seen on Figure 1 a, showing that the PdNPs are not well dispersed and they have agglomerated. When the PdNPs are deposited on top of the poly-CoTAPc (Figure 1 b), there is more evidence of more isolated nanoparticles compared to agglomerated ones. Figure 1 b Inset shows isolated PdNPs.

#### 3.1.2 XPS

XPS was also used to confirm the existence of poly-CoTAPc and PdNPs on the glassy carbon plate. Figure 2a shows the wide scan XPS spectra of poly-CoTAPc, PdNPs and PdNPs/poly-CoTAPc. All the spectra have C (1s) peak from the glassy carbon plates. Main peaks on the XPS spectra for poly-CoTAPc are Co (2p) and N (1s) which confirms that the electropolymerization of CoTAPc was achieved. The oxygen peak at 532 eV is also visible on the poly-CoTAPc. The peak originates from the oxygen adsorbed on the surface of poly-CoTAPc. PdNPs and PdNPs/poly-CoTAPc do not show the oxygen peaks as the Pd (3p) has dominant peaks in the region where the oxygen peaks are located. Co (2p) and N (1s) peaks were also observed on the PdNPs/poly-CoTAPc. XPS spectra of PdNPs and PdNPs/poly-CoTAPc showed the characteristic features of palladium at 1159 eV (Pd MNNa), 672 eV (Pd 3s), 560 eV (Pd 3p), 533 eV (Pd 3p), 336 eV (Pd 3d), 88 eV (Pd 4s) and 52 eV (Pd 4p). The chloride peak is from the PdCl2 used for the formation of PdNPs.

High resolution XPS spectra were carried out at Pd 3d peak for PdNPs and PdNPs/poly-CoTAPc. Figure 2b shows peaks at 335.4 eV and 340.6 corresponding to Pd 3d<sub>5/2</sub> and Pd 3d<sub>3/2</sub> respectively for both PdNPs and PdNPs/ poly-CoTAPc. This indicates that most of the Pd ions have been reduced to Pd<sup>0</sup> as reported in literature [35,36]. However, there are some noticeable peaks at the binding energies of 337.8 eV and 343.0 eV. They correspond to the Pd2+ ions which have not been reduced. In the case of PdNPs/poly-CoTAPc it is possible that nitrogen atoms (from the peripheral amino groups on the Pc) are coordinatively bonded to palladium ions [37], hence not in the Pd<sup>0</sup> state. To prove if there are any bonds formed between nitrogen atoms and palladium ions, a high resolution XPS was carried out at the N 1s energy levels. Figure 2c and 2d show the N 1s spectra of poly-CoTAPc and PdNPs/poly-CoTAPc. The peaks at binding energy of around 398 eV and 400 eV are observed and are attributed to imine (=N-) and amine (-NH-), respectively [35,36]. The latter has shifted to higher energies for PdNPs/poly-CoTAPc due to the presence of Pd. The peak at binding energy of 402.5 eV is attributed to charged nitrogen species [35,36] and it is not observed on the PdNPs/poly-CoTAPc. This may suggest that it have been involved in forming a bond with palladium ions.

## 3.1.3 Cyclic Voltammetric Characterization of the Modified Electrodes

The anodic and cathodic peak separation  $(\Delta E_p)$  for modified electrodes (in 2 mM ferricyanide containing 0.1 M KCl) for bare GCE, PdNPs-GCE, poly-CoTAPc-GCE and PdNPs/poly-CoTAPc-GCE are 83 mV, 100 mV, 78 mV and 88 mV, respectively at a scan rate of 100 mV/s, Table 1. In terms of electron transfer efficiency the order poly-CoTAPc-GCE> bare GCE > PdNPs/poly-CoTAPc-GCE > PdNPs-GCE. Of interest is the fact that in the presence of poly-CoTAPc, the  $\Delta E_p$  for PdNPs-GCE (100 mV) changed to 88 mV for PdNPs/poly-CoTAPc-GCE.

The surface roughness factor for the modified electrodes were determined using [Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>3-/4-</sup> redox system and applying Randles-Sevcik Equation 1 for reversible systems [38]:

$$I_p = 2.69 \times 10^5 n^{\frac{3}{2}} A C D^{\frac{1}{2}} v^{\frac{1}{2}}$$
 (1)

where  $I_p$ , n, A, C, D and v are the peak current, the number of electrons involved, the surface area, the concentration of [Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>3-/4-</sup>, the diffusion coefficient of  $[Fe(CN)_6]^{3-/4-}$  and the scan rate, respectively. From the D value for  $K_3[Fe(CN)_6] = 7.6 \times 10^{-6} \text{ cm}^2 \text{ s}^{-1}$  [39] and n = 1, the surface roughness factors (ratio of  $I_{pa}$  experimental/ $I_{pa}$ theoretical) of the electrode were found to be 1.08, 1.33

and 1.46 for PdNPs-GCE, poly-CoTAPc-GCE and PdNPs/poly-CoTAPc-GCE, respectively. Corresponding to a real electrode areas {(roughness factor × theoretical surface area  $(=0.071 \text{ cm}^2)$ } of  $0.077 \text{ cm}^2$  for PdNPs-GCE, 0.094 for poly-CoTAPc-GCE and 0.10 cm<sup>2</sup> for PdNPs/ poly-CoTAPc-GCE.

Using the effective area of the electrode, the surface coverage was calculated using Equation 2 [40], and the cyclic voltammograms for modified electrodes in pH 8 buffer (Figure 3).

$$\Gamma = Q/nFA \tag{2}$$

where  $\Gamma$  is the film surface coverage, n is the number of transferred electrons, F is the Faraday constant, and A is the effective area of the electrode area. The values of the surface coverages were found to be  $1.8 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{mol cm}^{-2}$ for PdNPs-GCE,  $6.1 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{mol cm}^{-2}$  for poly-CoTAPc-GCE and  $1.9 \times 10^{-9} \,\mathrm{mol \, cm^{-2}}$  PdNPs/poly-CoTAPc-GCE, Table 1. Thus, higher surface coverages are obtained in the presence of both poly-CoTAPc and PdNPs.

Figure 3 shows the cyclic voltammograms of bare GCE, poly-CoTAPc-GCE, PdNPs-GCE and PdNPs/poly-CoTAPc-GCE recorded in pH 8 buffer at a scan rate of 50 mV/s. pH 8 buffer was used since hydrazine analysis

will be carried out at this pH. The bare GCE showed no peak. Poly-CoTAPc-GCE showed peaks though they were not well pronounced. The inset on Figure 3 shows that there are two processes occurring at the electrode. Process labeled I at E1/2=-0.20 V is attributed to CoII/ Co<sup>I</sup> (though the assignment is still controversial [33]). Process II at E1/2=0.15 V is attributed to the CoIII/CoII [33, 41–43]. Both peaks are not well resolved as has been observed before [33]. Increasing the number of scan for polymer formation was reported not to improve resolution of these peaks [33]. The peak near 0.8 V (Figure 3, insert) is associated with the oxidation of the amino group [44]. Palladium nanoparticles undergo oxidation to give different types of oxides, processes 2a and 3a (Figure 3) [14, 45, 46] which are reduced at 3c. The redox couple labelled 1a/1c is also associated with PdNPs redox processes [14, 45].

#### 3.1.4 Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS)

The bare and the modified electrodes were examined by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in 2 mM ferricyanide containing 0.1 M KCl and the results are shown in Figure 4a and b. Figure 4a shows the Nyquist plot for the various electrodes that were used in this study. The plots are composed of semi-circles and straight line portions, representing charge transfer (Rct) and diffusion controlled processes, respectively. The Randles equivalent circuit for this process is shown as an inset in Figure 4a. The equivalent circuit is composed of R<sup>s</sup> (the resistance of the electrolyte), in series connection with parallel elements of Cdl (double layer capacitance), Rct (resistance to charge transfer) and Z<sup>w</sup> (Warburg impedance). Such circuits have been observed in other studies [47]. The Rct values as determined by the diameter of the semi-circle were found to be 202.4 W, 251.0 W, 9.6 W and

17.4 Ω, for bare GCE, PdNPs-GCE, poly-CoTAPc-GCE and PdNPs/poly-CoTAPc-GCE respectively, Table 1. The bare electrode and PdNPs-GCE have larger semi-circles than for the rest of the electrodes, showing that poly-CoTAPc-GCE and PdNPs/poly-CoTAPc-GCE have better conductivity. This has been observed before for carbon nanotubes/FePc composite electrode [20]. Also PdNPs/poly-CoTAPc-GCE offers limited resistance to charge transfer (compared to PdNPs-GCE) hence promoting very fast electron exchange rate.

The Bode plot (phase angle  $(\theta)$  versus log frequency) for the various electrodes is shown in Figure 4b. On a Bode plot, the Warburg impedance exhibits a phase angle below 45°. The Bode plots confirm the structural differences between the modified and the bare GCE. The slight changes in the phase angle and frequencies confirmed that oxidation processes were taking place at the modified surfaces rather than on the bare GCE.

#### 3.2 Hydrazine Detection

#### 3.2.1 Cyclic Voltammetry

Figure 5a shows the cyclic voltammograms of bare and poly-CoTAPc modified GCE recorded in 1 mM hydrazine. The bare electrode had a broad peak for hydrazine at 0.45 V. Modifying the electrode with CoTAPc caused a shift of potential to 0.14 V. The hydrazine oxidation peak was observed at -0.20 V and -0.28 V (in 1 mM hydrazine) on PdNPs-GCE (Figure 5b) and PdNPs/poly-CoTAPc-GCE (Figure 5c), with background corrected currents of 36 µA and 60 µA, respectively. Both show larger currents than poly-CoTAPc-GCE alone with currents of 16 µA. PdNPs/poly-CoTAPc-GCE shows the largest currents for hydrazine oxidation of 60 µA. The peaks between 0.4 and 0.6 V are due to the oxidation of PdNPs. Peaks due to hydrazine oxidation (for PdNPs-GCE and PdNPs/poly-CoTAPc-GCE, shown by arrows) increased with increase in concentration in Figure 5b and 5c confirming that they are due to the analyte. Increasing the concentration of hydrazine resulted in the shift of its oxidation potential to more positive values. The hydrazine peak is observed at -0.28 V (1 mM hydrazine) in this work, which is more negative than PdNPs and Pc alone, but also more negative than reported on similar electrodes in the literature, Table 2. Thus combining Pc with PdNPs offers an advantage for the detection of hy-

The overall reaction for hydrazine is represented by Equation 3.

$$N_2H_4 \to N_2 + H^+ + 4e^-$$
 (3)

This mechanism has been proposed for the oxidation of hydrazine on PdNPs [16]. The oxidation of hydrazine on CoTAPc is in the range of Co<sup>II</sup>/Co<sup>I</sup> couple of CoTAPc, hence this couple is involved in the mechanism. The mechanism for oxidation of hydrazine on MPc complexes has been reported in literature [48].

## 3.2.2 Kinetic Studies of Hydrazine Oxidation on PdNPs/ Poly-CoTAPc-GCE

PdNPs/poly-CoTAPc-GCE was employed in this section due to its high electrocatalytic activity for hydrazine detection compared to the other electrodes. When the scan rate was increased from 50 mV/s to 300 mV/s, the hydrazine oxidation peak shifted towards positive potentials as shown in Fig. 6a. This is an indication of irreversibility of the redox reaction. Figure 6b and 6c shows linear plots of current versus root of scan rate and the plot of peak potential versus log scan rate for hydrazine oxidation, respectively. The plots in Figure 6b confirm that the catalytic oxidation of hydrazine is diffusion controlled. The relationship between peak potential and scan rate for an irreversible diffusion-controlled process is given by Equation 4) [40]

$$E_p = \frac{2.3 RT}{2(1-\alpha)n_a F} \log \nu + K \tag{4}$$

where  $\alpha$  is the transfer coefficient,  $n_{\alpha}$  is the number of electrons involved in the rate determining step, v is the scan rate, K is a constant, R is the universal gas constant and T is the temperature (298 K). The plot of  $E_p$  versus log v (Figure 6c) gave a linear relationship and the Tafel slope was 204 mV decade<sup>-1</sup>. Tafel slopes larger than 30-120 mV decade<sup>-1</sup> have been associated with chemical reactions coupled to electrochemical steps [49] or to substrate-catalyst interactions in a reaction intermediate [50].

## 3.2.3 Chronoamperometric Studies

Chronoamperometry data were used to determine catalytic rate constant for the oxidation of hydrazine. Figure 7a shows the chronoamperometric evolutions on polarized PdNPs/poly-CoTAPc-GCE (as an example). The inset shows a linear relationship between current and concentration and the slope of this plot represent the sen-

sitivity of electrode towards the analyte. The limits of detection (LOD) of  $9.6 \times 10^{-6} \,\mathrm{mol}\,\mathrm{L}^{-1}$  for poly-CoTAPc,  $5.7 \times 10^{-6} \text{ mol L}^{-1}$  for PdNPs-GCE and  $1.3 \times 10^{-6} \text{ mol L}^{-1}$  for PdNPs/poly-CoTAPc-GCE, using the  $3\delta$ /slope ratio notation (where  $\delta$  is the standard deviation of the plot) were obtained, Table 2. Thus the lowest detection limit was observed for PdNPs/poly-CoTAPc-GCE, showing the importance of combining the two electrocatalysts. The detection limit for hydrazine oxidation on PdNPs-GCE is comparable to that obtained on PdNPs/carbon black-GCE, Table 2. The LOD obtained for hydrazine oxidation on PdNPs/poly-CoTAPc-GCE is smaller than when a self-assembled monolayer of FePc was employed, but larger than when using CoPc carbon paste electrode. However PdNPs/poly-CoTAPc-GCE has the advantage of a very low oxidation potential compared to the rest of the electrodes in Table 2.

Figure 7b shows the plots of  $(I_{cat}/I_{buf})$  versus  $t^{1/2}$  (Equation 10) for hydrazine oxidation. The catalytic current  $(I_{cat})$  is dominated by the rate at which hydrazine is oxidized on PdNPs/poly-CoTAPc-GCE. Similar plots were obtained when poly-CoTAPc-GCE and PdNPs-GCE were employed. The slopes of the plot of  $(I_{cat}/I_{buf})$  versus t<sup>1/2</sup> were used to calculate the rate constant according to Equation 5 [51].

$$\frac{I_{\text{cat}}}{I_{\text{buf}}} = \gamma^{\frac{1}{2}} \pi^{\frac{1}{2}} = \pi^{\frac{1}{2}} (k_{\text{cat}} C t)^{\frac{1}{2}}$$
 (5)

where  $I_{\text{cat}}$  and  $I_{\text{buf}}$  are currents in the presence and absence of hydrazine, respectively,  $k_{\rm cat}$  is the catalytic rate constant, C is the concentration of hydrazine and t is the time elapsed in seconds. The plots of the square of slopes obtained from Figure 7b versus concentration of hydrazine were done (figures not shown). Linear relationships were observed and represented by Equation 6 for PdNPs/ poly-CoTAPc-GCE.

where the slope of this plot is equal to  $\pi k$  and the value of k was found to be  $6.12 \times 10^8 \,\mathrm{cm^3 mol^{-1} \,s^{-1}}$  for PdNPs/ poly-CoTAPc-GCE. The catalytic rate constants for poly-CoTAPc-GCE and PdNPs-GCE were found to be 2.86×  $10^8 \,\mathrm{cm^3 \,mol^{-1} \,s^{-1}}$  and  $5.54 \times 10^8 \,\mathrm{cm^3 \,mol^{-1} \,s^{-1}}$  respectively. This shows the superiority of the combining poly-CoTAPc and PdNPs. The catalytic rate constants obtained for hydrazine detection in literature are 4.7×  $10^7 \,\mathrm{cm^3 \,mol^{-1} \,s^{-1}}$  and  $4.1 \times 10^7 \,\mathrm{cm^3 \,mol^{-1} \,s^{-1}}$  for gold nanoparticles-choline film and gold nanoparticles-polypyrrole nanowire, respectively [52,53]. The high catalytic rate constant for PdNPs/poly-CoTAPc-GCE shows the effectiveness of the electrocatalyst for the oxidation of hydrazine.

#### 4 Conclusions

The PdNPs were successfully deposited on the bare GCE and on the poly-CoTAPc. The combination of poly-

CoTAPc and PdNPs in PdNPs/poly-CoTAPc-GCE resulted in improved electrocatalytic activity towards hydrazine. PdNPs/poly-CoTAPc-GCE was the best electrocatalyst with hydrazine detection at -0.28 V. Further analysis using EIS showed that there is less resistance on PdNPs/ poly-CoTAPc-GCE than PdNPs-GCE for electron transfer with Rct values of 17.4 W and 251 W, respectively. Chronoamperometric studies also confirmed that PdNPs/ poly-CoTAPc-GCE is the best with catalytic rate constant of 6.12 - 10<sup>8</sup> cm3mol-1 s -1 .

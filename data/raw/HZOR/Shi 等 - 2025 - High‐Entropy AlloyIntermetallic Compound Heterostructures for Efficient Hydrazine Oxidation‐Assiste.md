Configuring integrative catalytic heterostructures is an efficient strategy to circumvent the universal linear scaling relationships for accelerating multiple-intermediate redox reactions. Here this study reports nonprecious metal-based high-entropy alloy/intermetallic compound heterostructure with a 3D nanoporous architecture as a high-performance electrocatalyst for hydrazine oxidation reaction. By making use of strain engineering of hexagonal close-packed multicomponent intermetallic compound core, high-entropy NiFeCoCuCrMn alloy surface is comprised of multiple active centers with undulatory adsorption energies, which enable \*N2H2 intermediate spillover to adjust rate-determining step and lower kinetic barriers. As a consequence of nanoporous architecture endowing abundant multiple active surfaces, this heterostructure mediates hydrazine electrooxidation of as high as ampere-level current densities at >0.08 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, showing genuine potential to replace sluggish oxygen evolution reaction for hydrogen production via water electrolysis. Its hydrazine oxidation-assisted water electrolyser delivers 500 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> at ultralow cell voltage of 0.87 V, and maintains exceptional stability for 1000 h.

power sources (e.g., solar, or wind) is an environmentally friendly scheme for largescale green hydrogen production.[3,4-6] Nevertheless, OWS technologies including alkaline water electrolyser, hydroxideexchange-membrane water electrolyser and proton-exchange-membrane water electrolyser are far from widespread implementation due to their insufficient operating efficiencies primarily caused by anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with high thermodynamic potential (1.23 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE) and sluggish kinetics.[4,5,7-10] No matter basic or acidic OER efficiently mediated by precious or nonprecious metal-based electrocatalysts, they usually require high cell voltages (>1.6 V) to achieve industrial current densities of >500 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, resulting in excessive energy consumption.[7-9,11-14] Such dilemma highlights urgent demands for developing more cost-effective hybrid water electrolysis (HWE) that makes

use of thermodynamically favorable electrooxidation reactions of small molecules to substitute anodic OER.[15-21] Among many innovative HWE systems, hydrazine (N2H4) oxidation-assisted water electrolysis shows genuine potential to replace traditional OWS for high-efficiency hydrogen production because of exceptionally low theoretical oxidation potential of hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR, -0.33 V vs RHE) and nontoxic, stable and safe N<sub>2</sub> byproduct, which promises significant electricity save and avoids explosive H<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>2</sub> mixtures, respectively.[15-17,21-24] Initial strides have been made to construct hydrazine oxidation-assisted water electrolysers (HAWEs), [25-28] but few HAWEs can satisfy the standards of high current density and long lifetime required for industrial hydrogen production due to insufficient activity and durability of state-of-the-art HzOR electrocatalysts.<sup>[25,28]</sup> Therein, most electrocatalysts are made of single-site platinum-group metals (e.g., Pd, [15] Pt, [29] Ru, [30] etc.) or nonprecious transition-metal compounds (e.g., Ni<sub>2</sub>P,<sup>[31]</sup> Ni<sub>3</sub>N,<sup>[32]</sup> Co<sub>3</sub>N,<sup>[33]</sup> etc.), which usually encounter the universal linear scaling relationships (LSRs) governing incongruous adsorption/desorption of multiple intermediates during the HzOR. In view that the electrocatalytic HzOR involves the \*N2H4 adsorption, successive \*N2H2 intermediate

dehydrogenation, and final nitrogen desorption, [15–17] it is of high desire to design versatile electrode materials that not only possess robust architecture to guarantee electron and ion transport pathways but also endow abundant multi active centers to overcome LSRs and efficiently mediate the successive dehydrogenation of \*N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>x</sub> intermediates.

Here we report nonprecious metal-based high-entropy alloy/intermetallic compound (HEA/HEI) heterostructures with a bicontinuous and nanoporous architecture as self-supported robust electrocatalytic materials for high-efficiency HzOR. Specifically, the nanoporous HEA/HEI heterostructures are composed of high-entropy NiFeCoCuCrMn alloy surface in-situ forming on hexagonal close-packed (hcp) multicomponent intermetallic compound of  $Al_3$  (NiFeCoCuCrMn)<sub>2</sub>. As a result of mutative dband distributions from high-energy Cr and Mn to moderateenergy Fe and Co, and then low-energy Ni, Cu, there forms a undulatory adsorption surface with multiple active centers on the NiFeCoCuCrMn HEA shell. Meanwhile, the strain engineering of hcp intermetallic compound regulates their adsorption energies to facilitate the initial adsorption of \*N2H4 on Cr-Mn pair sites, and successive dehydrogenation of \*N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>x</sub> intermediates along with the adsorption shift from Cr-Mn-Fe to Cr-Mn-Ni-Fe hollow sites for the final generation of N2 on Ni-Fe pair sites. The \*N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>x</sub> intermediate spillover adjusts rate-determining step (RDS) and lowers kinetic barriers. By virtue of bicontinuous nanoporous architecture facilitating electron transfer and electrolyte/gas mass transportation along interconnective metallic skeleton and interpenetrative pores, as well as endowing abundant multiple active sites, the self-supported HEA/HEI heterostructure of NiFeCoCuCrMn/Al<sub>3</sub>(NiFeCoCuCrMn)<sub>2</sub> exhibits exceptional HzOR electrocatalysis, with ultralow onset potential (-0.038 V vs RHE) and Tafel slope ( $\approx 12 \text{ mV dec}^{-1}$ ). It achieves current density of as high as  $\approx 1.1$  A cm<sup>-2</sup> at 0.1 V versus RHE. Besides, this HEA/HEI heterostructure also shows outstanding hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalytic activity and durability. In the H-type cells with nanoporous HEA/HEI heterostructure electrodes as the anode and the cathode, the symmetric HAWEs exhibit highly efficient hydrogen production in KOH||KOH-N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>, alkaline or neutral seawater||KOH-N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> electrolytes. The current density can reach 500 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> at  $\approx$ 0.87 V, ≈1.4 V lower than OWS in 1 M KOH electrolyte. Furthermore, they maintain excellent stability for over 1000 h.

### 2. Results and Discussion

The self-supported nanoporous NiFeCoCuCrMn/Al<sub>3</sub>(NiFeCoCuCrMn)<sub>2</sub> HEA/HEI heterostructure electrode is prepared by a facile and scalable alloying/dealloying procedure (**Figure 1a**). Briefly, the precursor alloy of quasi-eutectic-composition Ni<sub>15</sub>Fe<sub>3</sub>Co<sub>3</sub>Cu<sub>3</sub>Cr<sub>3</sub>Mn<sub>3</sub>Al<sub>70</sub> (at%) is firstly produced by arcmelting pure Al, Ni, Fe, Co, Cu, Cr and Mn metals, followed by directional solidification in an argon atmosphere (Figure S1, Supporting Information). During the solidification process, there forms a multiphase structure mainly composed of intermetallic Al<sub>3</sub>(NiFeCoCuCrMn)<sub>2</sub>, [34,35] Al<sub>3</sub>Ni, [35,36] Al<sub>13</sub>Fe<sub>4</sub>, Al<sub>9</sub>Co<sub>2</sub>, Al<sub>2</sub>Cu, Al<sub>13</sub>Cr<sub>2</sub> and Al<sub>6</sub>Mn, in addition to a little  $\alpha$ -Al (Figures S2 and S3, Supporting Information). When chemically dealloyed in KOH solution, selectively etching  $\alpha$ -Al phase and less-noble Al component from these intermetallic compounds

gives rise to the formation of Al<sub>3</sub>(NiFeCoCuCrMn)<sub>2</sub> skeleton with high-entropy NiFeCoCuCrMn alloy surface. Owing to the ratio of more-noble alloy compositions and less-noble Al in Al<sub>3</sub>(NiFeCoCuCrMn)<sub>2</sub> exceeding the parting limit, [37] there does not further occur dealloying process when forming NiFeCoCuCrMn/Al<sub>3</sub>(NiFeCoCuCrMn)<sub>2</sub> HEA/HEI heterostructure. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis verifies the presence of Ni, Fe, Co, Cu, Cr, Mn and Al (Figure S4, Supporting Information), with atomic ratio of 38:8:8:8:4:3:31 according to X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) (Figure S5, Supporting Information). X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of nanoporous HEA/HEI heterostructure electrode display one set of diffraction peaks at  $2\theta = 25.3^{\circ}$ ,  $31.3^{\circ}$ ,  $44.7^{\circ}$ ,  $45.1^{\circ}$ ,  $48.6^{\circ}$  and 65.3° corresponding to the (100), (101), (110), (102), (111) and (202) planes of hcp Al<sub>3</sub>Ni<sub>2</sub> (JCPDS 14-0648) (Figure 1b), [34,38] confirming the multicomponent Al<sub>3</sub>(NiFeCoCuCrMn)<sub>2</sub> intermetallic compound skeleton. Relative to those of nanoporous NiCu/Al<sub>3</sub>(NiCu)<sub>2</sub> heterostructure composed of binary NiCu alloy shell on intermetallic Al<sub>3</sub>(NiCu)<sub>2</sub> core, the peak positions of nanoporous HEA/HEI heterostructure shift to higher angles, indicating the partial substitution of Ni sublattice in the Al<sub>3</sub>Ni<sub>2</sub> by Fe, Co, Cr and Mn atoms in addition to Cu (Figure 1c) in view of their similar atomic radius and bonding energies. According to the (110) diffraction peak position, the lattice parameter of nanoporous HEA/HEI heterostructure is calculated to be ≈2.03 Å, lower than that of NiCu/Al<sub>3</sub>(NiCu)<sub>2</sub> ( $\approx 2.05$  Å). Different from nanoporous NiFeCoCuCrMn HEA with a face-centered cubic (fcc) crystallographic structure (fcc-HEA), there do not observe characteristic fcc diffraction peaks on the HEA/HEI heterostructure probably due to the epitaxial growth of surface NiFeCoCuCrMn HEA along the hcp crystallographic structure of Al<sub>3</sub>(NiFeCoCuCrMn)<sub>2</sub> (Figure 1c). Figure 1d shows a representative scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) image of nanoporous HEA/HEI electrode, where a bicontinuous nanoporous architecture is of the characteristic length of 3–5 nm (Figure S6, Supporting Information). In the STEM image and the corresponding EDS elemental mappings (Figure 1e), all elements including Ni, Fe, Co, Cu, Cr, Mn and Al uniformly distribute along the interconnective ligament of HEA/HEI heterostructure. High-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) image illustrates the HEA/HEI heterostructure to be composed of hcp Al<sub>3</sub>(NiFeCoCuCrMn)<sub>2</sub> core and NiFeCoCu-CrMn shell (Figure 1f), which is further verified by argon ion sputtering-assisted XPS characterization. As shown in Figure \$7 (Supporting Information), the argon-ion-etched nanoporous HEA/HEI heterostructure displays higher Al 2p XPS intensity than the pristine one.

**Figure 2a** shows high-resolution Cu  $2p_{3/2}$ , Ni  $2p_{3/2}$ , Co  $2p_{3/2}$ , Fe  $2p_{3/2}$ , Mn  $2p_{3/2}$  and Cr  $2p_{3/2}$  XPS spectra of nanoporous NiFeCoCuCrMn/Al<sub>3</sub>(NiFeCoCuCrMn)<sub>2</sub> HEA/HEI heterostructure. These elements are primarily in metallic states, except for little oxidized species due to inevitable surface oxidation or adsorption of hydroxyl groups during dealloying process (Figure S8, Supporting Information). [39–43] As a result of synergic effect of HEA/HEI heterostructure and multicomponent on the chemical states, these Cu<sup>0</sup>  $2p_{3/2}$ , Ni<sup>0</sup>  $2p_{3/2}$ , Co<sup>0</sup>  $2p_{3/2}$  and Fe<sup>0</sup>  $2p_{3/2}$  peaks shift to lower binding energies relative to those of nanoporous individual fcc-HEA and NiCu/Al<sub>3</sub>(NiCu)<sub>2</sub> (Figure 2b). Compared with the contribution of HEA/HEI heterostructure, the

incorporation of Fe, Co, in particular less electronegative Cr and Mn gives rise to more charge transfer to Cu and Ni, as illustrated by more positive peak shift of  $Cu^0 2p_{3/2}$  and  $Ni^0 2p_{3/2}$  in nanoporous NiCu/Al<sub>3</sub>(NiCu)<sub>2</sub> than in nanoporous individual fcc-HEA (Figure 2b). While for the Mn<sup>0</sup>  $2p_{3/2}$  and Cr<sup>0</sup>  $2p_{3/2}$  XPS spectra of nanoporous HEA/HEI heterostructure (Figure S9, Supporting Information), they display negative shifts relative to those in fcc-HEA. These are further demonstrated by representative Kedge X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectra of Ni in HEA/HEI, individual fcc-HEA and NiCu/Al<sub>3</sub>(NiCu)<sub>2</sub>. As shown in Figure 2c, all XANES profiles lie between the Ni foil and NiO to attest the metallic state. [44,45] The near-edge energies with the order of HEA/HEI < fcc-HEA < NiCu/Al<sub>3</sub>(NiCu)<sub>2</sub> reveal their different accumulation of electrons on the Ni atoms due to strain effect and ligament effect via the formation of Ni-M coordination.[46,47] As illustrated by the wavelet transform (WT)-EXAFS contour plots (Figure 2d), the HEA/HEI heterostructure shows one intensity maximum value for Ni-M coordination at ≈2.36 Å in R space, resulting in local tensile strain compared with individual fcc-HEA (≈2.12 Å) and NiCu/Al<sub>3</sub>(NiCu)<sub>2</sub> (≈2.29 Å).[46,48,49] Figure 2e shows the Fourier transformed K-edge extended X-ray absorption fine structure (FT-EXAFS) spectra of Ni, Fe, Co, Cu, Mn and Cr in the HEA/HEI heterostructure. All transition metals in the first shell are of similar radial distances

and amplitudes, suggesting that they are in a consistent local atomic environment due to fully random mixing distribution in the HEA/HEI heterostructure.[50,51]

To evaluate HzOR electrocatalysis, all self-supported nanoporous electrodes are directly used as the working electrodes for electrochemical measurements in a three-electrode setup. Figure 3a shows the initial linear scanning voltammetry (LSV) curves of nanoporous HEA/HEI electrode within a wide potential window of -0.05-1.75 V versus RHE in 1 M KOH solution without (KOH) and with 0.1 M N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> (KOH-N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>). In the KOH-N2H4 electrolyte, the nanoporous HEA/HEI electrode exhibits distinct voltammetric behaviors in two potential regions: the hydrazine oxidation in -0.05 < E < 0.8 V and the surface oxidation reconstruction to further mediate OER in E > 0.8 V, in contrast with its blank voltammetry in the N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>-free KOH solution, where the nanoporous HEA/HEI electrode undergoes direct surface oxidation. To verify these different electrochemical processes, in-situ Raman measurements are carried out to demonstrate the surface species changes of nanoporous HEA/HEI electrode at various applied potentials (Figure \$10, Supporting Information). Despite inevitable surface oxidation or adsorption of hydroxyl groups during the dealloying process, there does not observe characteristic Raman bands of M-OOH species except for the one at ≈790 cm<sup>-1</sup> assigned to

the N─H stretching modes of adsorbed \*N2H4 in KOH-N2H4 solution at open circuit potential (OCP) probably because of N2H4 triggered electroless reduction of M─OOH species to metallic states (Figure [3b\)](#page-4-0).[\[52,53\]](#page-10-0) In 0 *< E <* 0.15 V, there appears neoformative Raman band at ≈1640 cm<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> corresponding to the N─H bending modes of \*N2H*<sup>x</sup>* intermediates,[\[52,54\]](#page-10-0) of which the relative intensity increasing dramatically with the potential (Figure [3b\)](#page-4-0). As the potential increases from 0.15 to 0.8 V, there are less and less \*N2H4 and \*N2H*<sup>x</sup>* intermediates to be adsorbed on nanoporous HEA/HEI heterostructure until its complete deactivation caused by surface oxidation reconstruction at *E >* 0.8 V. While in the N2H4-free KOH solution (Figure [3c\)](#page-4-0), there observe Raman bands at ≈478, ≈580, ≈620, ≈680 cm<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> assigned to the M─O vibrations of M─OOH in addition to the one at ≈800 cm<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> for the \*O intermediates,[\[55,56\]](#page-10-0) attesting the formation of surface oxides on nanoporous HEA/HEI. No matter in KOH-N2H4 or in N2H4-free KOH solution, the nanoporous HEA/HEI heterostructure undergoes surface oxidation reconstruction for the subsequent OER at higher potential regions. As a consequence, the nanoporous HEA/HEI heterostructure with surface oxides does not show evident hydrazine-oxidation current response in KOH-N2H4 during the subsequent LSV probably due to their poor activity toward HzOR (Figure S11, Supporting Information). These facts indicate the significant role of metallic HEA/HEI heterostructure in mediating electrocatalytic HzOR.

Evidently, the nanoporous HEA/HEI electrode not only has ultralow onset potential of −0.038 V but also delivers ampere-level HzOR current densities at *E >* 0.08 V, surpassing the nanoporous fcc-HEA and NiCu/Al3(NiCu)2 electrodes.

spectroscopy (EIS) analysis further demonstrates the enhanced kinetics of nanoporous HEA/HEI heterostructure for electrocatalytic HzOR. In the Nyquist plot (Figure 3f), the EIS spectra show two characteristic semicircles in the middle- to low-frequency range, corresponding to the charge transfer resistance ( $R_{\rm CT}$ ) and the pore resistance ( $R_{\rm P}$ ) in parallel with the constant phase elements (CPEs), while the intercept on the real axis at the high frequencies represents the intrinsic resistance ( $R_{\rm I}$ ) of both electrode and electrolyte. [36,57] Based on the equivalent circuit (inset of Figure 3f), the  $R_{\rm CT}$  value of nanoporous HEA/HEI electrode is evaluated to be as low as  $\approx$ 0.8  $\Omega$ , much lower than those of fcc-HEA ( $\approx$ 1.3  $\Omega$ ), NiCu/Al $_3$ (NiCu) $_2$  ( $\approx$ 6.3  $\Omega$ ) and Pt/C/Ni ( $\approx$ 9.3  $\Omega$ ) (Table S1, Supporting Information).

In order to reveal individual role of Cu, Fe, Co, Cr or Mn in improving electrocatalysis of HEA/HEI heterostructure, five more nanoporous HEA/HEI heterostructure electrodes without the incorporation of Cu, Fe, Co, Cr or Mn are fabricated by the same alloying/dealloying precedure. Except for the Cufree one that is in fcc crystallographic structure (fcc-HEA-Cu), the other nanoporous electrodes without Fe (HEA/HEI-Fe), Co (HEA/HEI-Co), Cr (HEA/HEI-Cr) and Mn (HEA/HEI-Mn) are in HEA/HEI heterostructure (Figure \$12, Supporting Information). Obviously, these nanoporous electrodes without the incorporation of Cu, Fe, Co, Cr or Mn component exhibit inferior HzOR electrocatalysis relative to the nanoporous HEA/HEI of NiFeCoCuCrMn/Al<sub>3</sub>(NiFeCoCuCrMn)<sub>2</sub> (Figure S13, Supporting Information), highlighting the synergic effect of Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni and Cu in boosting HzOR. Figure 3g compares the specific activities of all nanoporous electrodes, where their electrochemical surface areas (ECSAs) are determined by the reduction peaks of surface Ni(OH), in the corresponding cycling voltammetry curves (Figure S14, Supporting Information), with the charge density of 514  $\mu$ C cm<sub>Ni</sub><sup>-2</sup>. [58] The specific activity of NiFeCoCuCrMn/Al<sub>3</sub>(NiFeCoCuCrMn)<sub>2</sub> HEA/HEI heterostructure is as high as  $\approx 0.335$  mA cm<sub>ECSA</sub><sup>-2</sup> at 0.1 V,  $\approx 4.2$ -,  $\approx 3.8$ -,  $\approx$ 2.3-,  $\approx$ 2.3- and  $\approx$ 2.0-fold higher those of nanoporous HEA/HEI-Cr ( $\approx 0.080 \text{ mA cm}_{ECSA}^{-2}$ ), HEA/HEI-Mn ( $\approx 0.089 \text{ mA cm}_{ECSA}^{-2}$ ), HEA/HEI-Fe ( $\approx 0.143$  mA cm<sub>ECSA</sub><sup>-2</sup>), HEA/HEI-Co ( $\approx 0.145$  mA  $cm_{ECSA}^{-2}$ ) and fcc-HEA-Cu ( $\approx 0.165$  mA  $cm_{ECSA}^{-2}$ ) electrodes (Figure \$15, Supporting Information), respectively, indicating the different ligand effect of Cu, Fe, Co, Cr or Mn on HzOR electrocatalysis of HEA/HEI heterostructure. While for the fcc-HEA made of the same elements, the specific activity is only a quarter of the intrinsic activity of NiFeCoCuCrMn/Al<sub>3</sub>(NiFeCoCuCrMn)<sub>2</sub> HEA/HEI heterostructure, reflecting the strain effect of hcp intermetallic compound of Al<sub>3</sub>(NiFeCoCuCrMn)<sub>2</sub> to optimize the undulatory adsorption energies and accelerate the reaction kinetics of multiple-step HzOR. These impressive electrochemical properties allow the nanoporous HEA/HEI heterostructure electrode to outperform state-of-the-art HzOR electrocatalysts, including low-dimensionally nanostructured highentropy alloys with/without noble metals, intermetallic compounds, nitrides and phosphides (Figure 3h; Table S2, Supporting Information). [24,25,28-31,59-62] Figure S16 (Supporting Information) shows the Faradaic efficiency (FE) of nanoporous HEA/HEI heterostructure electrode for the HzOR, which is measured at a current density of 0.5 A cm<sup>-2</sup>. Therein, the FE is determined by comparing the amount of gas produced experimentally with the theoretically calculated value. [26,27] The almost coincidence of both values ( $\approx$ 98% FE) indicates that there take place negligible side reactions during the HzOR.

Density functional theory (DFT) simulations are conducted to investigate HzOR electrocatalytic mechanism of HEA/HEI heterostructure, which is constructed by combining NiFeCoCu-CrMn HEA layer with hcp intermetallic Al<sub>3</sub>Ni<sub>2</sub> (HEA/Al<sub>3</sub>Ni<sub>2</sub>) for simplification (Figure S17, Supporting Information), in contrast with NiCu binary alloy layer on Al<sub>3</sub>Ni<sub>2</sub> (NiCu/Al<sub>3</sub>Ni<sub>2</sub>) and fcc-HEA NiFeCoCuCrMn (Figures S18 and S19, Supporting Information). Considering the random distributions of Ni, Fe, Co, Cu, Cr and Mn in the HEA, all DFT calculations are performed on the most stable atomic configurations in Figure 4a. No matter in HEA/Al<sub>3</sub>Ni<sub>2</sub> or fcc-HEA, there take place electron transfers from the lowly electronegative Cr and Mn to the highly electronegative Ni, Fe, Co and Cu on the NiFeCoCuCrMn HEA surface, as illustrated by their charge density difference mappings (Figure S20, Supporting Information). Such electron redistributions endow an undulatory adsorption surface as a result of mutative d band distributions from the high-energy Cr and Mn, to the moderateenergy Fe and Co and then the low-energy Ni, Cu. As shown in the projected density of states (PDOS) (Figure 4b), the *d* orbitals of Cr and Mn broaden and cross the Fermi level ( $E_E$ ), which give rise to high adsorption energy sites at Cr-Mn pairs. While for Fe, Co and Ni, Cu, the d orbitals occupy the bands near  $E_F$  and below  $E_{\rm F}$ , respectively, resulting in moderate and low adsorption energy sites. Owing to the strain effect imposed by intermetallic Al<sub>3</sub>Ni<sub>2</sub> core, there observe the evident downshifts of *d* bands for Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni and Cu on HEA/Al<sub>3</sub>Ni<sub>2</sub> relative to on the fcc-HEA, weakening the adsorption energies of NiFeCoCuCrMn surface. To elucidate the molecular orbital (MO)-level mechanism governing N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> adsorption on Cr-Mn pairs, the corresponding PDOS analysis is performed on HEA/Al<sub>3</sub>Ni<sub>2</sub> and fcc-HEA (Figure 4c). The distinct orbital hybrid states between p orbitals of N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> and d orbitals of Cr and Mn atoms confirm the initial adsorption of N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> thermodynamically taking place on the bridge site of Cr-Mn (Figure S21, Supporting Information). The hybrid states of HEA/Al<sub>3</sub>Ni<sub>2</sub> are narrower than that of fcc-HEA, indicating that the adsorption energy on HEA/Al<sub>3</sub>Ni<sub>2</sub> is weaker than that on fcc-HEA. Figure 4d shows the charge density difference of \*N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> that thermodynamically prefers to adsorb on Cr-Mn pair sites of HEA/Al<sub>3</sub>Ni<sub>2</sub>. There appears evident electron accumulation on N atoms and depletion around H atoms. The crystal orbital Hamilton population (COHP) analysis of N-H bond in the \*N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> demonstrates that the electron transfer from the Cr-Mn sites enlists the antibonding states of  $*N_2H_4$  to cross the  $E_F$  for the activation of N-H bond for dehydrogenation (Figure 4e). Compared with that on the fcc-HEA (Figure S22, Supporting Information), the slightly lower adsorption energies of HEA/Al<sub>3</sub>Ni<sub>2</sub> lead to a more positive integral COHP (ICOHP) value of \*N2H4, suggesting the enhanced dehydrogenation reaction kinetics. While on the NiCu/Al<sub>3</sub>Ni<sub>2</sub>, the \*N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> prefers to adsorb at Ni-Ni sites (Figure \$23, Supporting Information), which undergo a low activation capability of N-H bond with the exceptionally negative ICOHP.

Figure 4f shows the reaction Gibbs free energy ( $\Delta G$ ) profiles for the successive dehydrogenation processes of  ${}^*N_2H_4$  on HEA/Al $_3Ni_2$ , fcc-HEA and NiCu/Al $_3Ni_2$ . Obviously, they suffer from different RDS due to their distinct adsorption capability of  ${}^*N_2H_x$  intermediates. When mediated by the

NiFeCoCuCrMn HEA surface with undulatory adsorption energies on HEA/Al3Ni2, there spontaneously takes place the dehydrogenation of \*N2H4 to form \*N2H3 intermediate, accompanied by the adsorption shift from Cr-Mn pair sites to Cr-Mn-Fe hollow sites. During the subsequent dehydrogenations, there produce \*N2H2 and \*N2H1 intermediates to adsorb on Cr-Mn-Ni-Fe hollow sites and then \*N2 on Ni-Fe pair sites for the final generation of N2. Therein, the dehydrogenation of \*N2H1 to form \*N2 encounters the highest energy barriers of ≈0.2 eV, acting as the RDS during the HzOR. This is different from the RDSs on NiCu/Al3Ni2 with the same intermetallic Al3Ni2 core (the dehydrogenation of \*N2H4 to generate \*N2H3, Δ*G*RDS = ≈0.35 eV) and fcc-HEA with the same NiFeCoCuCrMn surface (the dehydrogenation of \*N2H3 to form \*N2H2, Δ*G*RDS = ≈0.32 eV), indicating the synergic effect of compressive strain and multicomponent ligand in modulating the undulatory adsorption energies to boost the reaction kinetics of HzOR. In view that there generate hydrogen protons during the dehydrogenation of \*N2H4, the superior electrocatalysis of HEA/HEI heterostructure is also reflected by the strongest pH dependence of HzOR current density (Figure 4g; Figure S24, Supporting Information).[\[63,64\]](#page-10-0)

The nanoporous NiFeCoCuCrMn/Al3(NiFeCoCuCrMn)2 HEA/HEI heterostructure electrode also exhibits outstanding HER electrocatalysis in 1 M KOH solution or alkaline seawater (**Figure 5**a; Figure S25, Supporting Information). To demonstrate alkaline HER mechanism, DFT calculations are also carried out on HEA/Al3Ni2 (Figure S26, Supporting Information), fcc-HEA (Figure S27, Supporting Information) and Pt. Figure S28a (Supporting Information) shows the alkaline HER reaction pathways on HEA/Al3Ni2, fcc-HEA and Pt, following a Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism. When mediated by HEA/Al3Ni2 heterostructure, H2O molecules prefer to first adsorb on Cr top site for water dissociation into \*H and \*OH with an energy barrier of ≈0.46 eV (Figure S26a,b, Supporting Information), which is lower than the values on fcc-HEA (≈0.58 eV, Figure S27a,b, Supporting Information) and Pt (≈1.16 eV). By virtue of multicomponent HEA enabling undulatory adsorption surface, there takes place \*H intermediate spillover from initial adsorption on Cr-Ni-Cu to Cu-Mn-Cu hollow site, bridged by Mn-Ni-Cu, for the generation of H2 molecule, with the lowest energy barrier of ≈0.22 eV (Figure S28b, Supporting Information). Although there also occurs \*H intermediate spillover on fcc-HEA (from initial adsorption on Cr-Mn-Ni to Cr-Fe-Cu hollow site to generate H2, bridged by Cr-Ni-Cu), the energy barrier is of as high as ≈0.32 eV (Figure S28c, Supporting Information).

H-type double-chamber HAWEs are assembled with nanoporous HEA/HEI electrodes as electrocatalysts for cathodic HER in alkaline seawater/1 M KOH and anodic HzOR in KOH-N2H4 solution, respectively, separated by an anion exchange membrane. The separation design can obtain highpurity H2 at cathode by avoiding the pollution of N2H4 to the cathode solution. Figure 5b compares the LSV curves of HAWEs based on nanoporous HEA/HEI electrodes. In the system of KOH||KOH-N2H4, where there takes place alkaline HER on the cathode and HzOR on the anode, respectively, the HAWE delivers a current density of 500 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> at 0.87 V, ≈1.4 V lower than the corresponding OWS with HER and OER in the **[www.advancedsciencenews.com](http://www.advancedsciencenews.com) [www.advmat.de](http://www.advmat.de)**

KOH||KOH electrolyte. Even though the HER usually suffers from sluggish reaction kinetics in alkaline or neutral seawater probably due to inevitable side reactions caused by dissolved inorganic salts (e.g., Mg<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup>, Ca2<sup>+</sup>, Cl<sup>−</sup> and SO4 <sup>2</sup><sup>−</sup>), organic molecules or living microscopic organisms,[[27,65\]](#page-10-0) the HAWE in the alkaline seawater||KOH-N2H4 or neutral seawater||KOH-N2H4 electrolyte can reach ≈300 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> or ≈150 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> at 0.87 V, respectively (Figure [5b;](#page-7-0) Figure S29, Supporting Information). Furthermore, these HAWEs exhibit impressive electrochemical stability during the long-term durability tests for 1000 h. As shown in Figure [5c,](#page-7-0) there do not observe evident current-density fluctuations, except for current-density reductions of 3% and 6%, in KOH||KOH-N2H4 at 0.25 V and in alkaline seawater||KOH-N2H4 at 0.9 V, respectively. STEM image of nanoporous HEA/HEI heterostructure and its corresponding EDS mappings of all components demonstrate that it still maintains the initial nanoporous structure after the HzOR electrocatalysis for 1000 h (Figure S30, Supporting Information). This is also confirmed by XRD characterizations on nanoporous HEA/HEI heterostructure after the stability test, where it displays the almost same diffraction patterns as that of the pristine one (Figure S31, Supporting Information). The outstanding electrochemical durability of nanoporous HEA/HEI electrode is further reflected by ICP-OES analysis of electrolyte, in which negligible Ni, Fe, Co, Cu, Cr, Mn and Al ions are to be detected (Table S3, Supporting Information). These excellent electrochemical behaviors enlist the HAWEs based on nanoporous HEA/HEI heterostructure electrodes to outperform some of the best ones reported previously (Figure [5d;](#page-7-0) Table S4, Supporting Information)[.24,25,29,31,33,52,61](#page-10-0) The energy consumption is estimated to be 6.7 kWh kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> H2 in HAWE (Note S1, Supporting Information), which is a seven-fold reduction relative to OWS (45.6 kWh kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> H2)[.25,31](#page-10-0) When powered by harvestable solar energy via commercially available photovoltaic cells, the HAWEs can realize zero-carbon emission for highpurity H2 production (Figure S32, Supporting Information). More noticeably, the nanoporous HEA/HEI heterostructure electrode can serve as the anode and couple with the Pt/C/Ni cathode to construct a direct hydrazine fuel cell (DHzFC) (Figure S33a,b, Supporting Information), which exhibits an open-circuit voltage of 1.01 V and delivers a maximum power density of ≈62 mW cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> at a cell voltage of 0.45 V at room temperature. This enables a self-powered H2 production system by integrating HAWE with DHzFC devices (Figure [5f;](#page-7-0) Figure S33c, Supporting Information).

# **3. Conclusion**

In summary, we have developed an interface engineering strategy to configure high-entropy alloy/intermetallic compound heterostructure (HEA/HEI) heterostructure electrocatalyst featuring hexanary NiFeCoCuCrMn HEA layer in-situ formed on interconnective multicomponent intermetallic Al3(NiFeCoCuCrMn)2 network, which acts as a bifunctional electrocatalyst toward both HzOR and HER for high-purity hydrogen production via hydrazine oxidation-assisted water electrolysis. By making use of strain effect imposed by hexagonal close-packed intermetallic Al3(NiFeCoCuCrMn)2 core, the NiFeCoCuCrMn HEA surface is composed of multiple active centers with undulatory adsorption energies to endow \*N2H*<sup>x</sup>* intermediate spillover during the successive dehydrogenation, where the rate-determined step is the dehydrogenation of \*N2H1 to form \*N2 with the barrier energy of as low as ≈0.2 eV, substantially boosting the HzOR kinetics. At the potential of 0.1 V versus RHE, the specific activity of nanoporous HEA/HEI heterostructure reaches ≈0.335 mA cmECSA<sup>−</sup>2. By virtue of 3D nanoporous architecture that endows abundant multi-site surface and facilitates electron transfer and reactant species transportation, this nanoporous HEA/HEI heterostructure electrocatalyst exhibits exceptional HzOR electrocatalysis in the mixture of 1 M KOH and 0.1 M N2H4, along the ultralow onset potential (−0.038 V vs RHE) and Tafel slope (≈12 mV dec<sup>−</sup>1). It only requires 0.1 V to obtain high current density of ≈1.1 A cm<sup>−</sup>2, outperforming some of the best HzOR electrocatalysts reported previously. While working as the HER electrocatalyst, the nanoporous HEA/HEI heterostructure electrode can obtain ampere-level current density at the overpotential of as low as ≈140 mV. These electrocatalytic properties enlist HAWEs based on nanoporous HEA/HEI heterostructure electrodes to exhibit highly efficient hydrogen production in KOH||KOH-N2H4, alkaline or neutral seawater||KOH-N2H4 electrolytes. In the Htype cells, the HAWE can reach 500 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> at ≈0.87 V, ≈1.4 V lower than OWS in 1 M KOH electrolyte. During the hydrogen production at high current densities, they can maintain outstanding stability for over 1000 h. A self-powered H2 production system can be constructed by integrating HAWEs to DHzFC. This work paves a way for developing high-performance multicomponent alloy catalysts with undulatory adsorption surface to boost multiple-intermediate reactions in various energy conversion devices via an unusual catalytic mechanism of intermediate spillover.

# **4. Experimental Section**

*Preparation of Nanoporous Electrocatalysts*: Self-supported nanoporous high-entropy alloy/intermetallic compound heterostructure electrodes were prepared by facile and scalable alloying/dealloying procedures. Precursor alloys of Ni30<sup>−</sup>*v*−*w*−*x*−*y*−*z*Fe*v*Co*w*Cu*x*Cr*y*Mn*z*Al70 (*v*, *w*, *x*, *y*, *z* = 0 or 3, at%) were first fabricated by arc melting pure Ni and Al metals with/without the addition of Fe, Co, Cu, Cr or/and Mn in Ar atmosphere. The alloy ingots were directional solidified into columnar alloys with a stretch speed of 100 μm s−<sup>1</sup> under the protect of Ar. After being cooled to room temperature, the columnar alloys were cut into sheets with a thickness of ≈400 μm and then chemical dealloyed in N2-saturated 6 M KOH solution at 70 °C until there were no bubbles. After rinsing in ultrapure water to clean residual chemicals in nanopores, the as-dealloyed nanoporous alloys were directly used as electrocatalytic electrode materials for HzOR/HER electrochemical measurements. Pt/C electrode supported by nanoporous Ni was prepared by uniformly mixing commercially available Pt/C (20 wt.%, Johnson Matthey) into isopropanol aqueous solution containing proper Nafion (0.05 wt.%, Sigma–Aldrich) with ultrasonication treatment and then dropping onto nanoporous Ni collector with the loading mass of 2 mg cm<sup>−</sup>2.

*Physicochemical Characterizations*: X-ray diffraction measurements were conducted on a Rigaku Smartlab diffractometer at a power of 9 kW with a monochromated Cu K radiation to characterize the phase composition of precursor alloys and nanoporous alloys. Microstructures and chemical composition of nanoporous electrodes were performed by a field-emission scanning electron microscope (JSM-7900F, 5 kV) and a fieldemission transmission electron microscope (JEOL JEM-2100F, 200 kV) equipped with X-ray energy-dispersive spectroscopy. Chemical states of elements were analyzed via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (Thermo EC-SALAB 250) with an Al anode by correcting charging effects according to

<span id="page-9-0"></span>the C 1 s peak (284.8 eV). Nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms at 77 K were obtained on a micromeritics ASAP 2020 system to assess the surface area by the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method, as well as the pore size distribution from density functional theoretic (DFT) models. The metal ion concentrations of tested electrolyte were measured by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES, Thermo electron). The X-ray absorption spectra (XAS) measurements were performed on a laboratory device (easyXAFS300).

Electrochemical Measurements: Electrochemical measurements for HzOR and HER were conducted in a classic three-electrode configuration, where self-supported nanoporous electrodes were directly used as the working electrode, a graphite rod as the counter electrode and an Ag/AgCl electrode as the reference electrode. All potentials were iR-corrected and calibrated relative to RHE according to the equation  $E_{\rm RHE} = E_{\rm Ag/AgCl}$  + 1.016 – iR in 1 M KOH with/without 0.1 M N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>. The polarization curves of nanoporous electrodes were collected at a scan rate of 1 mV s<sup>-1</sup> at 25 °C. Electrochemical impedance spectra were obtained in the frequency range from 10 mHz to 100 kHz with 5 mV amplitude at the potential of 0 V for HzOR and -0.1 V for HER. Cyclic voltammetry curves were measured in the potential range from 0 to 1.4 V versus RHE at a scan rate of 2 mV s<sup>-1</sup> in 1 M KOH to evaluate the electrochemical surface area of these nanoporous electrodes. The hydrazine oxidization coupled hybrid water splitting electrolysers were conducted by nanoporous HEA/HEI electrodes as the anode and the cathode, using 1 M KOH with 0.1 M N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> and neutral seawater/alkaline seawater/1 M KOH solution as the electrolytes, respectively. The polarization curves of the electrolysers were collected at a scan rate of 1 mV s $^{-1}$  at 25 °C. The N $_2$ H $_4$  fuel cells were assembled by nanoporous HEA/HEI or Pt/C/Ni electrodes as the anode and Pt/C/Ni as the cathode at 25 °C.

DFT Simulation: All the spin-polarized DFT calculations were performed based on the DMol3 code of the Materials Studio 2024 software. The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional was applied to describe the exchangecorrelation effects, combining with the double numerical plus polarization (DNP) basis set. The DFT semi-core pseudopotentials (DSPP) was adopted to deal with relativistic effects and the Grimme method (DFT-D) was selected to describe the Van der Waals interactions. The model of (111) terminated CrMnFeCoNiCu HEA slab of a face-centered cubic crystal structure was constructed by 4 × 4 supercell with four atomic layers, and the lattice parameter was set to be the average one of all the six elements. The model of HEA/Al<sub>3</sub>Ni<sub>2</sub> heterostructure was constructed by combing a two-layer HEA plane with a two-layer Al<sub>3</sub>Ni<sub>2</sub>(110) plane using  $2 \times 1$  supercell. To determine the most possible preferred models, 20 models of NiFeCoCuCrMn HEA and 10 models of HEA/Al<sub>3</sub>Ni<sub>2</sub> were built based on the Atom Simulation Environment (ASE) package, and the total energy of different models were compared. The atomic distributions of different elements were arranged randomly with a vacuum in the z direction of 15 Å, and the atomic ratios were determined by experimental results. During the geometry optimizations, the bottom two layers of the models were fixed. The k-point samplings of the Brillouin zone were set to  $3 \times 3 \times 1$ , and the real-space global orbital cutoff radius was set to 4.8 Å. The convergence criteria of energy change, gradient and displacement were set to be 1.0  $\times$  10<sup>-5</sup> Ha, 2.0  $\times$  10<sup>-3</sup> Ha Å<sup>-1</sup> and 5.0  $\times$  10<sup>-3</sup> Å, respectively. The reaction Gibbs free energy ( $\Delta G$ ) was determined by:  $\Delta G = \Delta E + \Delta ZPE - T\Delta S$ , where  $\Delta E$ ,  $\Delta ZPE$  and  $\Delta S$  were corresponding to the change of total energy, zero-point energy and entropy, respectively.

#### Abstract

Replacing the slow oxygen evolution reaction with favorable hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) is a green and efficient way to produce hydrogen. In this work, we synthesize amorphous/crystalline RhFeP metallene via phase engineering and heteroatom doping. RhFeP metallene has good catalytic activity and stability for HER and HzOR, and only an ultralow voltage of 18 mV is required to achieve 10 mA cm−<sup>2</sup> in a two-electrode hydrazine-assisted water splitting system. The superior result is mainly ascribed to the co-doping of Fe and P and the formation of amorphous/crystalline RhFeP metallene with abundant phase boundaries, thereby adjusting electronic structure and increasing active sites.

# 1. Introduction

As an environmentally friendly emerging energy, H2 is expected to replace fossil energy and become an important energy source in the future energy system [[1](#page-5-0)–[4](#page-5-0)]. Hydrogen production through water splitting has a good application prospect [[5](#page-5-0)–[8](#page-5-0)]. However, the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER, 4OH– → O2 + 2H2O + 4e– , 1.23 V) is a slow four-electron reaction, which requires a large amount of energy and restricts its wide application. Therefore, it highly desired to use the thermodynamically more favorable oxidation reaction to instead the OER for energy-efficient hydrogen production [[9](#page-5-0)–[13](#page-5-0)]. The hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR, N2H4 + 4OH– → N2 + 4H2O + 4e– , −0.33 V) possesses low theoretical potential and fast reaction kinetics, and is expected to be promising in combination with HER for energy-efficient hydrogen production.

Rh has similar physical and chemical properties to Pt, which has good corrosion resistance to electrolyte and excellent catalytic activity for HER and HzOR [[14](#page-5-0)–[18](#page-5-0)]. Recently, the structural engineering and heteroatom doping can improve atom utilization rate and tailor electronic structure, which further improve the catalytic activity for HER and HzOR [[19](#page-5-0)–[23](#page-5-0)]. As a graphene-like material, metallene has a large specific surface area and high atom utilization rate, which has good catalytic performance [[24](#page-5-0)–[27](#page-5-0)]. The incorporation of heteroatoms can optimize electronic structure of catalysts, thereby affecting hydrogen adsorption of catalysts [[28](#page-5-0)–[31](#page-6-0)]. In addition, the amorphous phase can expose abundant active sites, and the heterogeneous crystalline/ amorphous structure can further optimize adsorption energy of intermediates, thus showing superior performance [[32](#page-6-0)–[34](#page-6-0)].

Inspired by the above progress, we propose phase engineering and heteroatom doping strategies to synthesize RhFeP metallene with ultrathin and crystalline/amorphous heterostructure. Thanks to the heterogeneous crystalline-amorphous structure and co-doping of Fe and P, RhFeP metallene can exposes more active sites and optimized adsorption energy of intermediates, exhibiting superior HER and HzOR performance to Rh metallene and Pt/C, RhFeP metallene. By coupling HER with HzOR, RhFeP metallene displays exceptional catalytic activity, requiring only 18 mV to reach 10 mA cm−<sup>2</sup> .

#### 2.1. Chemicals and materials

Rhodium(III) acetylacetonate (Rh(acac)<sub>3</sub>, 99%) was obtained from Bide Pharmatech Ltd Nafion (5%) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Sodium borohydride (NaBH<sub>4</sub>, 98%), polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP, M.W.  $\approx$ 40 000), hydrazine monohydrate (N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>·H<sub>2</sub>O, 80%), isopropanol (IPA,  $\geqslant$ 99.5%), potassium hydroxide (KOH, 85%), nickel chloride hexahydrate (NiCl<sub>2</sub>·6H<sub>2</sub>O), nickel chloride hexahydrate (FeCl<sub>3</sub>·6H<sub>2</sub>O), cobalt chloride hexahydrate (CoCl<sub>2</sub>·6H<sub>2</sub>O) and sodium hypophosphite (NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>2</sub>) were obtained from Aladdin. Formaldehyde (HCHO) and benzyl alcohol (BA, AR,  $\geqslant$  99%) were obtained from Macklin. Pt/C (20 wt%) was ordered from Alfa Aesar.

## 2.2. Synthesis of RhFeP metallene

The Rh metallene was prepared based on previously reported work [35]. Briefly, Rh(acac)<sub>3</sub> (10 mg) and PVP (120 mg) were dissolved in BA (3 ml) and HCHO (3 ml). Next, the mixed solution was transferred to a 10 ml reactor, followed by solvothermal reaction at 180 °C for 8 h. After that, Rh metalleen was gathered through centrifugation six times with acetone and ethanol. Then, Rh metallene (4 mg) was dispersed into deionized water (2 ml), followed by adding NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>2</sub> (8 mg) and FeCl<sub>3</sub> solution (200  $\mu$ l, 20.0 mM) with vigorous stir. Subsequently, 2 ml of NaBH<sub>4</sub> (0.1 M) was added dropwise at room temperature under stirring for 20 min. Finally, RhFeP metallene was obtained after alternate wash with water and ethanol six times.

#### 2.3. Characterizations

Field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, Zeiss G500) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, TalosS-FEG) equipped with energy dispersive x-ray (EDX) spectroscopy was used to characterize morphology and microstructure of samples. The crystalline of catalysts was analyzed by x-ray powder diffraction (XRD, Ultima IV, Rigaku, Japan). x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, K-Alpha) was used to analyze surface elemental composition and electronic structure of catalysts. The surface topographic height of samples was measured via atomic force microscopy (AFM, Bruker).

#### 2.4. Electrochemical measurements

All electrochemical tests were carried out on the CHI660E instrument. Three-electrode system, including catalyst-coated glassy carbon electrode (GCE,  $0.071~\rm cm^2$ ) as working electrode, graphite rod as counter electrode and Hg/HgO (1.0 M KOH) electrode as reference electrode, was used for HER and HzOR measurements. To prepare working electrode, RhFeP metallene was ultrasonically dispersed in a mixed solution containing deionized (DI) water and isopropanol (H<sub>2</sub>O/isopropanol/Nafion = 6/3/1) to form homogeneous ink, which was dropped onto polished GCE. Linear sweep

voltammetry (LSV) curves of HER and HzOR were tested in 1 M KOH and 1 M KOH + 0.1 M N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>, respectively. All potentials were converted to a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) with iR compensation. The OHzS tests were tested using a two-electrode system, and the working electrode was carbon paper (CP) loaded with catalyst. In brief, 5 mg RhFeP metallene was dissolved in 1 ml deionized water, isopropanol and Nafion (5 wt%) mixed solution (H<sub>2</sub>O/isopropanol/Nafion = 6/3/1) to form homogeneous solution, which was coated on the treated carbon paper (1 cm<sup>2</sup>), dried to form the working electrode. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was recorded from 100 kHz to 0.1 Hz.

#### 3. Results and discussion

The synthesis of RhFeP metallene via a two-step approach is shown in figure 1. First, Rh metallene were synthesized by a solvothermal method under the assistance of PVP (figure S1), in which the decomposition of HCHO produces CO that adsorbs on the (111) plane of Rh, thus limiting its growth along the [111] direction [35]. Then, in NaBH<sub>4</sub>-added aqueous solution,  $H_2PO_2^-$  can be generated with hydrogen radicals or hydrogen radical anions to produce monomeric P, which is co-doped with reduced Fe to Rh metallene [36].

The crystal structures of RhFeP metallene and Rh metallene were studied by XRD. The RhFeP metallene and Rh metallene show clear XRD diffraction peaks consistent with the typical structure of face-centered cubic (fcc) Rh (JCPDS No. 05–0685) (figure 2(a)). As expected, the diffraction peaks of RhFeP metallene appear a slight negative shift because of the incorporation of Fe and P atoms, indicating lattice expansion. The surface valence state of RhFeP metallene were investigated by XPS. The XPS full spectrum of RhFeP metallene shows clear characterization peaks of Rh, Fe, and P elements (figure S2). For fine XPS spectrum of Rh 3d (figure 2(b)), two major peaks at 312.00 and 307.00 eV can be ascribed to Rh<sup>o</sup>, and two minor peaks at 313.00 and 308.00 eV correspond to Rh<sup>3+</sup> [37, 38]. The Rh  $3d_{5/2}$  peak of RhFeP metallene shifts to the lower binding energy by 0.28 eV compared with that of Rh metallene, indicating the existence of strong electronic interactions between Fe, P and Rh elements. The negative shift of XPS peaks can cause an upshift of the d-band center of Rh, and thus optimize the adsorption of active hydrogen on the catalyst, leading to improved catalytic activity [35, 39]. In the XPS spectrum of Fe 2p, two peaks at 723.90 and 711.00 eV are attributed to Fe<sup>2+</sup>, and two peaks at 728.40 and 715.50 eV are attributed to Fe<sup>3+</sup> (figure 2(c)) [40, 41]. Furthermore, two peaks of P 2p spectrum at 133.30 and 131.30 eV can be attributed to P<sup>5+</sup> and P°, respectively (figure 2(d)) [42, 43].

The morphology of RhFeP metallene was characterized by TEM. The RhFeP metallene shows ultrathin nanosheet with bends and wrinkles (figures 3(a)-(c)), and the AFM image determines the thickness of RhFeP metallene to about 1.50 nm (figure 3(d)). The metallene structure is conducive to providing a large surface area and facilitated channels for adsorption and activation of reactants. As shown in highresolution TEM (HRTEM) image (figure 3(e)), the RhFeP metallene has some amorphous regions, and the crystalline/ amorphous interface can be observed. The fast Fourier transform (FFT) pattern further confirms the co-existence of crystalline and amorphous phases in RhFeP metallene. Amorphous phases with substantial lattice disorder can provide abundant active sites. The clear lattice fringes with the lattice spacing of 0.225 nm correspond to fcc Rh crystals (figure 3(f)). The high-angle annular dark field-scanning transmission electron microscope (HAADF-STEM) and EDX

elemental mapping images of RhFeP metallene show the presence of Rh, Fe, and P, with the atomic ratio of 79.5/11.7/8.8. (figures 3(g) and S3). Using the same method, we can synthesize RhCoP metallene and RhNiP metalene from CoCl<sub>2</sub> and NiCl<sub>2</sub>, respectively (figure S4). The RhCoP metallene and RhNiP metalene retain the morphology of ultrathin nanosheets. The element content of RhCoP metallene and RhNiP metallene is similar to that of RhFeP metallene, which verifies the universality of the method (figure S5).

The HER tests of samples were tested in 1.0 M KOH using a three-electrode system. Figure 4(a) displays LSV curves of samples, and the RhFeP metallene has superior HER performance. The overpotential of RhFeP metallene is 28 mV at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> ( $\eta_{10}$ ), much lower than that of Rh metallene (89 mV) and Pt/C (44 mV) (figure 4(b)). In addition, we compared the HER performance of RhMP (M = Fe, Co, Ni) metallemes. It can be clearly seen that the  $\eta_{10}$  of RhFeP metallene is lower than that of RhCoP metallene (52 mV) and RhNiP metallene (80 mV) (figure S6). Above results demonstrate that the co-doping of transition metal M (M = Fe, Co, Ni) and P improves HER activity, and the codoping of Fe and P improves the HER performance more significantly. In order to study the reaction kinetic of samples, Tafel curve was obtained from LSV curve (figure 4(c)). The Tafel slope of RhFeP metallene is 38.74 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>, lower than that of control samples, indicating that RhFeP has better reaction kinetics and HER process follows Volmer-Heyrovsky pathway. In addition, the HER reaction kinetics can be further understood by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Among all samples, the RhFeP metallene has the smallest semicircle, indicating its best electron transfer capability (figure S7). The electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) was estimated from electrochemical double-layer capacitance  $(C_{\rm dl})$  derived from cyclic voltammogram (CV) curves. The ECSA of RhFeP metallene is 21.01 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>. larger than that of Rh metallene (5.24 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>) and Pt/C (3.53 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>), indicating that RhFeP metallene has higher

active sites (figure S8). In addition, the ECSA of different doping elements was compared, and the results show that RhFeP metallene has the largest ECSA (figure S9). RhFeP metallene has a faster electron transfer rate and more active sites, which is beneficial to improve the HER performance. We evaluated the stability of the catalyst by chron-opotentiometry (V-t) over a long period of time. After 24 h test, the catalytic activity of RhFeP metallene has no significant decay, showing good long-term stability (figure 4(d)).

The HzOR tests of samples were tested in 1.0 M KOH + 0.1 M N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>. The LSV curves of samples reveal that RhFeP metallene exhibits more excellent HzOR electrocatalytic performance (figure 5(a)). The RhFeP metallene only needs a low overpotential of 15 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> (figure 5(b)), much better than that of Rh metallene (122 mV) and Pt/C (190 mV). Importantly, the HzOR performance of RhFeP metallene is better than that of OER (322 mV), indicating that HzOR can replace OER for assisted hydrogen evolution (figure S10). The respective Tafel slope of RhFeP metallene is 21.85 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>, much lower than that of Rh metallene (39.19 mV  $dec^{-1}$ ) and Pt/C (30.40 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>) (figure 5(c)), suggesting that RhFeP metallene has faster catalytic kinetics in the HzOR process. In addition, a long-term stability test was performed on RhFeP metallene. After 2000 cycle test, RhFeP metallene still maintains good catalytic activity for HzOR (figure 5(d)).

Due to the excellent HER and HzOR performance of RhFeP metallene, two-electrode overall hydrazine splitting (OHzS) system was constructed for the energy-efficient production of  $\rm H_2$  using RhFeP metallene as a bifunctional catalyst, which was conducted in 0.1 M KOH + 0.1 M N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> (figure 6(a)). As shown in figure 6(b), compared with the LSV curve of OWS in 0.1 M KOH, the LSV curve of OHzS has a significant negative shift, indicating that alternative to OER with HzOR can significantly diminish the potential for hydrogen production from water electrolysis. Surprisingly,

RhFeP metallene only needs a low voltage of 18 mV to achieve the current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> for the OHzS. In addition, the voltages of RhFeP metallene at different current densities of 50, 100, and 200 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> for OHzS system are 76, 130, and 292 mV, respectively, much lower than those of OWS system (figure 6(c)). The cell voltage of RhFeP metallene is also smaller than that of reported electrocatalysts for OHzS. Additionally, long-term stability test for 24 h is shown in figure 6(d), in which RhFeP metallene maintains good catalytic activity and structure during the stability test, confirming the good stability (figure S11).

# 4. Conclusions

In summary, we synthesize RhFeP metallene with crystalline/amorphous structure for efficient H<sub>2</sub> generation in hydrazine-assisted water splitting. The RhFeP metallene only needs overpotentials of 28 and 15 mV at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> for HER and HzOR, respectively. RhFeP metallenellRhFeP metallene two-electrode system has good catalytic activity for OHzS under alkaline conditions, and only needs 18 mV to reach 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. The co-doping of Fe and P can optimize electronic structure, and ultra-thin morphology and heterogeneous structure endow RhFeP metallene with rich active sites and excellent mass transfer ability, thus displaying excellent catalytic performance. This work proposes the phase engineering and heteroatom doping strategies for the synthesis excellent electrocatalysts for efficient H<sub>2</sub> production via hydrazine-assisted water splitting.

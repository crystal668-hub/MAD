A hybrid heterostructure eletrocatalyst supported on Ni foam is facilely synthesized as a high-performance OER electrocatalyst for alkaline water electrolysis. Compared to their pristine NiV-LDH counterpart, the self-made NiV-LDH@FeOOH heterostructures exhibit an extremely low overpotential of  $\sim\!297$  mV at 100 mA cm $^{-2}$  current output, and excellent long-term durability.

With the increase of global population and rapid economic development, the demand for energy continues to rise. Traditional fossil fuels not only promote economic development, but also bring a lot of climate and environmental problems. It is extremely urgent to develop clean renewable energy. Electrochemical water splitting is an efficient and green approach to produce hydrogen energy, which provides a promising and environmentally friendly approach for the conversion and storage of clean and renewable energy.1 Electrochemical water splitting consists of two half-reactions: oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at the cathode, respectively. OER involves complex four electron transfer processes that greatly limit the overall efficiency of water splitting because of the high activation barrier and sluggish kinetic process.<sup>2</sup> Numerous research efforts have been devoted to developing efficient electrocatalysts to reduce the overpotential and improve the efficiency of the reaction. Currently, precious metal oxides (RuO<sub>2</sub> and IrO<sub>2</sub>) are proven to be the most effective OER catalysts,3 however, their high cost and scarcity seriously hinder their practical applications. In recent

Among these materials, transition metal-based layered double hydroxides (LDHs) have attracted tremendous attention due to their earth abundance, tunable chemical composition, 10 remarkable catalytic activity and easy preparation. In particular, Ni-based LDHs such as CoNi-LDH, NiFe-LDH, and NiV-LDH have been extensively studied as OER catalysts in alkaline media.11 Unfortunately, the OER electrocatalytic reaction performance of LDHS is severely limited by their intrinsically poor conductivity due to easy aggregation, and narrow electrochemically active area, and by their inability to meet practical applications. 11d,e In order to further improve their OER catalytic activity, considerable efforts have been made including interface engineering, defect engineering and composition optimization. Interface engineering aims at adjusting the properties of the material surface so that it has the appropriate adsorption energy for the reaction intermediate, neither strong nor weak. Optimizing the adsorption energy of the intermediates on the surface of materials is key to improving OER catalytic performance. Recently, Li and his colleagues reported a NiTe/NiS heterojunction catalyst consisting of NiS nanodots strongly coupled with NiTe nanowires grown in situ on Ni foam. The experimental results and DFT calculations showed that the construction of a NiTe/NiS heterojunction led to the redistribution of charge density of NiTe, which optimized the binding energy of the catalyst to the intermediate, thus improving the OER performance of the catalyst.<sup>12</sup>

Enlightened by the above viewpoints, herein, a nanoarray heterojunction electrocatalyst on Ni foam substrate with NiV-LDH nanosheet arrays coupled with FeOOH nanospindles is fabricated through a straightforward one-step hydrothermal process followed by an ultrafast interfacial reaction. The OER performance of this hetero-interface structure nanoarray electrode in an alkaline environment is further investigated.

years, tremendous interest has been focused on exploiting earthabundant non-precious metal-based catalysts, including transition metal oxides, hydroxides, layered double hydroxides, chalcogenides, phosphides, carbides and nitrides.

Fig. 1 Schematic of the process of NiV-LDH@FeOOH/NF heterostructure

Experimental analysis shows that the NiV-LDH@FeOOH/NF catalyst demonstrates remarkable OER activity in alkaline medium, which requires an overpotential of 297 mV to drive the current density of 100 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. Moreover, the catalyst possesses robust long-term durability in alkaline medium for at least 20 h. This work provides a simple and useful strategy for the design of low cost, highly active and robust OER electrocatalysts for water splitting, and they can also be used in other fields of energy conversion.

The Ni foam (NF) was selected as a substrate because of its excellent electrical conductivity, 3D macroporous structure (Fig. S1, ESI†), and various electrochemical features towards our application. The high purity Ni foam with a dimension of  $1 \text{ cm} \times 4 \text{ cm}$  was used as a substrate with some porosity. Fig. 1 illustrates a schematic representation of the NiV-LDH@FeOOH electrocatalyst on a Ni foam substrate using a two-step method. Initially, the NiV-LDH nanosheet arrays on the Ni foam were synthesized by a low-temperature hydrothermal method. In the second step, NiV-LDH@FeOOH/NF was constructed by an ultrafast interfacial reaction process. The detailed processes are presented in the Experimental section of the ESI.†

The structural information and morphology of the synthesized catalysts were characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Fig. 2a displays the typical SEM image of NiV-LDH/NF, which reveals that NiV-LDH nanosheets can vertically and uniformly grow on the surfaces of the Ni substrate. Furthermore, an

enlarged TEM image shows that these nanosheets were interconnected with each other, forming a network-like array structure with obvious ripples and corrugations, and revealing a smooth surface (Fig. 2b). As shown in Fig. 2c, the TEM image could further display the distinct sheet-like structure of NiV-LDH/NF. The corresponding high-resolution TEM image demonstrated the clear layer spacing. The SEM image (Fig. S2, ESI†) shows that the resulting NiV-LDH@FeOOH/NF retained the nanosheet array structure of NiV-LDH/NF. However, under higher magnification (Fig. 2d), the surface of the nanosheets are shown to be distinctly rough indicating that some nanoparticles were immobilized on the NiV-LDH surface. As revealed by the TEM image of NiV-LDH@FeOOH/NF (Fig. 2e), numerous FeOOH nanospindles were homogeneously anchored on the NiV-LDH nanosheet surface. The high-resolution TEM image in Fig. 2f revealed wellresolved lattice fringe spacing with an interplanar distance of 0.203 nm, corresponding to the (510) plane of the FeOOH species. Interestingly, the visible interfaces in NiV-LDH@FeOOH/NF can be clearly observed (marked by a red line). The interface of the two components plays a key role in the catalytic process. The corresponding energy-dispersive X-ray spectrum (EDX, Fig. S3, ESI†) result validates the formation of the NiV-LDH@FeOOH/NF hybrid with Ni, V, Fe and O as the precomputed elemental components (Fig. S4, ESI†). Moreover, element mapping analysis was further applied to verify the spatial distribution of every element on the Ni foam substrate. As shown in Fig. 3, the elemental distributions of Ni, V, Fe and O were highly uniform, indicating the homogeneous distribution of NiV-LDH nanosheet arrays on Ni foam and the uniform distribution throughout of FeOOH nanospindles on the LDH nanosheet surface.

The electrocatalytic OER activities of the as-obtained sample have been measured in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte using a standard three-electrode system (Fig. S5 and S6, ESI†). For comparison, the reference catalysts including bare Ni foam, NiV-LDH/NF, and NF supported RuO<sub>2</sub> (RuO<sub>2</sub>/NF) were also studied under the same conditions. Fig. 4a and Fig. S7 (ESI†) show the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves for OER of synthesized catalysts with a scan rate of 5 mV s<sup>-1</sup>. The NiV-LDH @FeOOH/NF catalyst exhibits a smaller OER onset potential of 1.49 V vs. RHE compared to bare Ni foam (the onset potential of 1.60 V), NiV-LDH/NF (the onset potential of 1.58 V, vs. RHE) and RuO<sub>2</sub>/NF (the onset potential of 1.55 V, vs. RHE).

As demonstrated in Fig. 4b, to obtain a specific catalytic current density of 100 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, the overpotential of NiV-LDH @FeOOH/NF 297 mV was needed, which was much lower than those of, NiV-LDH/NF (472 mV), RuO<sub>2</sub>/NF(467 mV) and bare Ni foam (528 mV). The results indicate that the NiV-LDH @FeOOH can be used as an electrocatalyst to efficiently catalyze OER, and the OER performance is apparently superior to most of the reported non-noble metal-based OER catalysts, such as NiFe LDH/graphene of 325 mV overpotential at 100 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, FeOOH/Co/FeOOH of 308 mV overpotential at 100 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, NiCo LDH/CFP of 370 mV overpotential at 100 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, and Ni<sub>3</sub>FeAl<sub>x</sub>-LDH/NF of 304 mV overpotential at 50 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, if the details are shown in Tables S1 and S2, ESI†).

The Tafel plots of the samples are shown in Fig. 4c, which can reflect the catalytic kinetics of the catalysts. NiV-LDH@FeOOH/NF presents the lowest Tafel slope value of 57.3 mV per decade for OER in contrast to those of bare Ni foam (104.4 mV per decade), NiV-LDH/NF (193.7 mV per decade), and IrO<sub>2</sub>/NF (101.3 mV per decade), respectively, indicating the excellent kinetics ability of the NiV-LDH@FeOOH/NF catalyst in the OER process. In addition, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis was also evaluated to study the charge transfer kinetics of all the synthesized catalysts.14 As the Nyquist plots show in Fig. 4d and Fig. S8, S9 (ESI†), NiV-LDH@FeOOH/NF has the smallest charge transfer resistance ( $R_{\rm ct}$ ) of 0.85  $\Omega$ , as compared to the bare Ni foam (67.9  $\Omega$ ), NiV-LDH/NF (4.3  $\Omega$ ), and RuO<sub>2</sub>/NF (13.8  $\Omega$ ), suggesting a faster electron transfer process, which contributed to the modification of the FeOOH species (Table S3, ESI†). At the same time, the integrated electrode of the growth catalyst has very good hydrophilicity, which guarantees the full penetration of the electrolyte and gas diffusion (Fig. S10, ESI†). The preparation time for FeOOH was adjusted to optimize the material properties. The final results show that when the time is 40 seconds, the resulting catalyst has the highest current output and the best

electron transfer capability (Fig. S11a and b, ESI†). Too much or too little catalyst is not conducive to performance optimization.

Electrocatalytic stability is another important criterion for evaluating catalysts. 15 Besides the high intrinsic activity, NiV-LDH@FeOOH/NF also affords remarkable long-time stability. For comparison, the long-time durability of RuO<sub>2</sub>/NF was also investigated in 1 M KOH. The current density of RuO2/NF quickly decays 56% within 20 h, while for NiV-LDH@FeOOH/ NF 95% current density can still remain after 20 h, implying its good durability for OER under alkaline conditions (Fig. 5a). The multi-potential and multi-current step tests also demonstrated the high durability of the catalyst (Fig. 5b and Fig. S12, ESI†). There are no appreciable differences in current deactivation and electron transfer capacity before and after 500 CV cycles (Fig. 5c and d) demonstrating the good stability of NiV-LDH@ FeOOH/NF. The morphological structure and electronic structure of NiV-LDH@FeOOH/NF, after the durability tests, were perfectly preserved (Fig. S13-S15, ESI†). The consistent high-resolution peak position of the Ni 2p XPS spectra for the NiV-LDH@FeOOH/Ni hybrid electrode before and after OER test indicate that the catalyst has good stability.

In order to study the mechanism of interfacial electronic transformation between FeOOH nanospidles and NiV-LDH nanosheets, XPS was used to analyze the surface compositions of the electrocatalysts for NiV-LDH/NF and NiV-LDH@FeOOH/NF. The two peaks of Ni 2p<sub>3/2</sub> and Ni 2p<sub>1/2</sub> for the NiV-LDH/NF electrode, located at 855.84 and 873.26 eV, respectively, are the characteristic features of Ni<sup>2+</sup>, accompanied by two shakeup satellite peaks at 861.38 and 879.80 eV. <sup>16</sup> Compared to the NiV-LDH/NF electrode, the characteristic peaks of the optimal composite electrode have obvious positive shifts (Fig. 6a). The results indicate the synergistic electronic interactions between NiV-LDH and FeOOH, so the introduced FeOOH moiety has a strong influence on the electronic structure of NiV-LDH@FeOOH/NF. <sup>17</sup>

Interestingly, this is not the case for V 2p XPS spectra. After the formation of NiV-LDH@FeOOH dual interface structure, the position of the peaks did not change, and thus demonstrated that the electronic structure of V species was maintained. Meanwhile, the position of high-resolution Ni 2p, V 2p and O 1s XPS spectra of the NiV-LDH/Ni and NiV-LDH powder samples have not changed, showing that the electron transfer of the NiV-LDH@FeOOH system is not affected by the Ni foam substrate (Fig. S16, ESI†). The XPS spectra of the NiV-LDH@FeOOH reflect a strong interfacial interaction, which could be very beneficial to the electrocatalytic OER correlated process.

In summary, we fabricated a composite of NiV-LDH and FeOOH on Ni foam through a facile two-step process. The catalyst exhibits extraordinarily high activity for OER in alkaline solution, which ranks top among the transition metal electrodes under alkaline conditions so far and is comparable to the state-of-the-art RuO2 catalyst. The excellent OER activity mainly stems from the roles of interface engineering for improving the electrical conductivity, optimizing the electronic structure and speeding up the mass transfer of gas released through the array architecture.

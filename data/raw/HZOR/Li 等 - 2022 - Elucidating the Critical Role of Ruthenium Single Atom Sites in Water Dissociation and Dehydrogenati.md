**Hydrazine oxidation (HzOR)-assisted overall water splitting (OWS) provides a unique approach to energy-efficient hydrogen production (HER). However, there are still major challenges in the design of bifunctional catalysts and gain deep insight into the mechanism of both water dissociation and dehydrogenation kinetics triggered by the same active species during HzOR-assisted OWS. Here, ruthenium single atoms (Ru SAs) anchored onto sulphur-vacancies of tungsten disulphide (WS2) are prepared by a sulfidation and facile galvanostatic deposition strategy. The WS2/Ru SAs act as a bifunctional catalyst and outperforms commercial platinum (Pt) catalysts for both HzOR and HER. Ultralow potentials of −74 and −32.1 mV at 10 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> are achieved for HzOR and HER, respectively. Two-electrode electrolyzer using WS2/Ru SAs as both anode and cathode reaches 10 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> with cell voltage of only 15.4 mV, which is far below that of most electrocatalysts including commercial Pt. Density functional theory calculations unravel the critical role of Ru SAs in WS2, where the sluggish dissociation of water in HER can be promoted on Ru sites, and the sulfur sites of WS2 exhibit a more thermoneutral behavior for hydrogen intermediate adsorption. Moreover, Ru sites are also active centers for stepwise hydrazine dehydrogenation during HzOR.**

## **1. Introduction**

The electrochemical water splitting system for high-purity hydrogen production is hindered by the more kinetically sluggish anodic reaction, oxygen evolution reaction (OER, 4OH<sup>−</sup> = O2 + 2H2O + 4e<sup>−</sup>, 1.23 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)) because of the high thermodynamic potential of multiproton-coupled-electron-transfer steps, which is considered as a bottleneck for the strategic development of hydrogen economy.[1,2] Although some extraordinary electrocatalysts were developed, it still needs to apply more working potential (higher than 1.5 V) for overall water splitting (OWS).[3–5] In this regard, replacing anodic OER with more thermodynamically favorable small-molecule oxidation reactions has been desired and triggered flourishing research focus.

Scheme 1. Schematic illustration of the proposed alkaline HER and HzOR mechanism on Sv-WS2, Sv-WS2@Ru NPs, and Sv-WS2/Ru SAs.

OERs such as methanol, [6] urea, [7] 5-hydroxymethylfurfural, [8] benzyl alcohol, [9] and hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR)[1,2] holds great potential to achieve ultralow cell voltage of OWS or produce value-added products. Among which the HzOR has attracted extraordinary attention because of the significantly low theoretical oxidation potential ( $N_2H_4 + 4OH^- \rightarrow$  $N_2 + 4H_2O + 4e^-$ , -0.33 V vs RHE) and produce hydrogen with low energy consumption. In addition, the only byproduct of nitrogen during HzOR is eco-friendly and much safer than the mixture of hydrogen and oxygen.[10] Some pioneering works have achieved the robust viability regarding the HzOR-assisted OWS, and have cut a notable Figure toward hybrid OWS.[1,2,11-13] For example, Liu et al. presented simultaneous interface engineering and chemical substitution to construct Mo-Ni<sub>3</sub>N/Ni/ NF and showed superior catalytic activity toward HzOR of -0.3 mV to achieve 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. A low cell voltage of 55 mV for HzOR-assisted OWS was obtained at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. [2] Zhang et al. reported anodic HzOR in water electrolysis based on bifunctional tubular CoSe2 nanosheet electrode and demonstrated appreciable superior HzOR activity of -17 mV working potential. The CoSe<sub>2</sub> also achieved low cell voltage of only 164 mV to deliver 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>.[13] Despite these progress, several key challenges remained still need to be solved as it is at the infant stage. First, the HzOR activity of the state-of-the-art catalysts is unsatisfying because the applied working potential is still much higher than theoretical value, which consequently induces high cell voltage of HzOR-assisted OWS. A large space is left to promote the HzOR performance by constructing advanced electrocatalysts for HzOR. Second, the exploration of bifunctional electrocatalysts toward both HzOR and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is quite difficult since the key active intermediates during HER and HzOR are different, and the modulation of rate-determining step (RDS) of water dissociation and dehydrogenation kinetics in alkaline HER and HzOR both need to be taken into account, which requires smart and precise catalysts design strategies.<sup>[1,11]</sup>

Extensive efforts have been invested in the design and synthesis of cost-effective noble metal-free catalyst including iron, nickel, cobalt, and their derivatives, but the catalytic performances do not outperform "incomparable" platinum (Pt) benchmark catalysts.<sup>[14,15]</sup> Among Pt-group metals, ruthenium

(Ru) has been regarded as a competitive alternative to the Pt, as it is cost-effective (4% that of Pt) and exhibits similar hydrogen bond energy to that of Pt (65 kcal mol<sup>-1</sup>). [14-17] More importantly, the Ru sites with rich electron in the hybrid electrocatalysts benefit the alkaline HER process with low water dissociation energy, which means the Ru-based catalysts represents potential in the advanced electrocatalysts for alkaline HER.[18,19] On the other hand, Ru sites can stabilize the HzOR intermediates and lower the energy barrier of RDS, implying that the Ru sites could be the active species to catalyze HzOR. [1,20] Taking advantages of promoting both water dissociation in alkaline HER and dehydrogenation kinetics in HzOR, the Ru species are expected to be the potential bifunctional centers in replacing Pt for HzOR-assisted OWS, which is underdeveloped. In order to further improve the electrochemical performance and reduce the content of precious metal catalysts, the size of Ru active species are reduced to atomic scale to form single-atom catalysts (SACs), which expose all the active metal atoms on the surface and thus can reach up 100% efficiency of atomic utilization.[21] Unfortunately, few reports were presented on the Ru SACs toward HzOR-assisted OWS, let alone the deep insight into the water dissociation and dehydrogenation kinetics mechanism on the Ru SACs, which is yet of great importance during the HzOR-assisted OWS.

Based on the above concept, in this work, the Ru single atom site (SAs) immobilized onto sulphur-vacancy (Sv) of tungsten disulfide nanosheets (WS2 NSs) was first prepared by facile galvanostatic deposition strategy and grown on conductive carbon cloth (CC@WS2/Ru SAs). The defective WS2 NSs were involved in the system as the metal-support interaction (MSI) induced by Ru SAs and edge-S sites of WS2, the electron transfer modulates the *d*-band structure of the hybrid structure and optimizes adsorption energy of reaction intermediates.<sup>[22,23]</sup> Besides, high surface free energy of Ru SAs makes their aggregation easy, the isolated Ru SAs should be better immobilized onto the vacancies of the WS<sub>2</sub> to stabilize Ru SAs.<sup>[24]</sup> Additionally, the structure of layered WS2 was reported similar as active sites of bioenzymes in nature that can boost the recombination of hydrogen intermediates (H\*) to form H2 molecules (Heyrovsky/Tafel step).[25] Therefore, the hypothesis was proposed and shown in Scheme 1. The synergy between Ru SAs and S-edges sites

in WS2/Ru SAs took placed during alkaline HER, the water molecules were adsorbed preferentially on Ru sites and dissociated to OH<sup>−</sup> and H\* with a low energy barrier, and combine another H\*(or H2O) and electrons into H2 molecules at a nearly thermodynamic potential on S-edges sites neighboring Ru sites. Meanwhile, at the other half-cell HzOR, the dehydrogenation process could be promoted by Ru SAs active sites and decrease the free energy of RDS of HzOR. Finally, a remarkable ultralow cell voltage of HzOR-assisted HER was expected to obtained. For comparison, the HER and HzOR kinetics on Sv-WS2 were sluggish because of the high energy barrier of water dissociation in HER and weaker adsorption of dehydrogenation in HzOR originating from the unsuitable orbital orientation, the absence of hydrophilic and high oxidation state of Ru SAs, and the repulsive interaction of N sites in hydrazine and edge-S sites in Sv-WS2. [22,26] While the aggregated Ru NPs in Sv-WS2 supported Ru nanoparticles (Sv-WS2@Ru NPs) exposed limited active sites and hindered water dissociation and dehydrogenation kinetics. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed as a proof-of-concept to disclose the water dissociation and dehydrogenation kinetics mechanism of the superior bifunctional activity on WS2/Ru SAs.

## **2. Results and Discussion**

## **2.1. Morphological and Structural Characterizations for the As-Prepared CC@WS2/Ru SAs**

The strategy of WS2/Ru SAs on CC is shown in **Figure 1**a. First, the WO3 nanowires grown on the CC (CC@WO3 NWs) as the precursor were fabricated by hydrothermal and calcining process. Then, the CC@WS2 was prepared by high-temperature sulfidation process under sulfur vapor atmosphere. The sulfur powder acts as sulfidation reducer of WO3, the excess of sulfur ensures the conversion from WO3 to WS2 completely and prevents the decomposition of WS2 at the same time.[27] In addition, more Sv were introduced during the one-pot sulfidation method due to the atomic diffusion.[28] Subsequently, a facile and fast galvanostatic deposition strategy was used to controllably immobilize Ru SAs onto the Sv of WS2. The cathodic electrochemical deposition strategy can precisely control the mass loading and nuclear of Ru SAs on the WS2 to ward off the aggregation of Ru SAs to clusters and abandon several weaknesses brought by the conventional SAC preparing methods including high-temperature pyrolysis, employment of toxic reductant, and suffer from a trial-and-error process induced by chemical vapor deposition, wet chemistry, atom trapping, etc.[29]

The morphological characterization of the samples was preliminarily performed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). As shown in Figure 1b,c, dense of WO3 nanowires are vertically covered on the CC. Following sulfidation, cross-linked nanosheets instead of nanowires could be observed in the SEM images of CC@WS2 (Figure 1d,e). After the galvanostatic deposition of Ru on the Sv of WS2, the CC@WS2/Ru-450 (the deposition time of Ru SAs is 450 s as noted) have similar structures with individual WS2 NSs, and no stacking phenomenon between layers of the WS2 nanosheet structure is observed, indicating the deposition of Ru on WS2 does not affect the morphology of WS2 (Figure 1f,g).[30] It is noted that the morphological changes during the high-temperature sulfidation process is attributed to the structural property of WS2. [27] As shown in Figure 1h, with the sulfidation reaction temperature rising, sublimed sulfur vapor reacts with surface WO3 to form SWS bonds, and small size of WS2 nanosheets form at the first reaction stage, as evidenced by the SEM images in Figure S1 of the Supporting Information, in which nanowires and nanosheets are coexistence in CC@WS2 at the sulfidation time of 0.5 h. Subsequently, the sublimed sulfur vapor further reacts with more WO3 nanowires and breaks the WO bonds, the WS2 nanosheets gradually grow large and stack perpendicular because of the formed lattice layers induced by weak van der Waals gap.[31] The WS2 nanosheets growth mechanism follows the Frankvan der Merwe principle, where small WS2 nuclei are formed and followed by selectively attaching additional atoms on the edges of the nuclei, resulting in the growth of 2D WS2 nanosheets.

The morphology and structure of samples were further characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). **Figure 2**a,b shows the nanowires of WO3 with some defects (within the dotted line circle) and the diameter is ≈40 nm. The distance between crystal planes of WO3 NWs is 0.38 nm, which can be assigned to the (002) facet of hexagonal WO3 (Figure 2d). The high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) image and elemental mappings of WO3 NWs reveals the uniform distribution of W and O elements in the WO3 (Figure 2c). After the sulfidation reaction, an effective replacement of O by S to form a new crystalline phase of WS2. As shown in Figure 2e,f, the morphology of nanosheets instead of nanowires are formed, the magnified TEM image noticeably shows that WS2 consists of homogeneously distributed 2D ultrathin nanosheet structure. The HAADF-STEM elemental mappings of W and S elements and corresponding energy disperse spectroscopy (EDS) spectrum (Figure S2, Supporting Information) confirm the successful formation of WS2 NSs (Figure 2g). The WS2/Ru-450 displays a similar structure with WS2, demonstrating the deposition of Ru in WS2 does not change the inherent morphology of WS2 (Figure S3, Supporting Information).[30] The microscopic atomic arrangement of Ru SAs in WS2 was further characterized by the spherical aberration correction (AC) HAADF-STEM, as shown in Figure 2i. The hexagonal structure can be clearly observed in the 2H phase of WS2 where the yellow and blue balls represent S and W atoms, respectively. The corresponding fast Fourier transform (FFT) analysis of HAADF-STEM image in Figure 2j further confirms the expected hexagonal structure characteristic of 2H-WS2 (Figure 2h,l).[32] In addition, the lattice spacing of 0.276 nm with intersection angle of 60° is indicative of the (100) plane for WS2/Ru-450 which implies that the immobilization of Ru SAs onto WS2 could not change the structure of WS2. [32,33] Furthermore, EDS pattern and elemental mappings indicate the uniformly distributed of the W, S, and Ru elements in the entire nanosheets, revealing the homogeneous isolation of Ru SAs onto the WS2 NSs (Figure 2k; Figures S4 and S5, Supporting Information). The existence of atomic Sv in WS2 was demonstrated by electron paramagnetic resonance **www.advancedsciencenews.com www.afm-journal.de**

(EPR) analysis. As shown in Figure S6 of the Supporting Information, compared to the weaker EPR signal (*g* = 1.996) of CC@WS2, the slightly intensified and broadened resonances are observed in CC@WS2/Ru-450, indicating the increased concentration of Sv in CC@WS2/Ru-450, which may due to the electrochemical etching during the galvanostatic deposition of Ru SAs process.[34,35]

X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of CC@WS2/Ru-450 was performed to further support the phase transformation from WO3 to WS2 and isolation of Ru SAs on WS2. As shown in **Figure 3**a, the XRD pattern of CC@WO3 displayed the diffraction peaks at 2*θ* values of 14.1°, 23.0°, 24.4°, 27.0°, 28.3°, 33.8°, and 36.8° can be indexed to the (100), (002), (110), (102), (200), (112), and (202) planes of hexagonal WO3 (JCPDS no. 85–2460), respectively. After the sulfidation reaction, apart from the broadest peak of 21.8° that assignable to the CC substrate, the peaks located at 14.3°, 28.8°, 33.3°, 39.2°, and 49.1° of CC@WS2 are assigned to the (002), (004), (101), (103), and (105) planes of 2H phase of WS2 (JCPDS no. 08–0237), respectively. The CC@WS2/Ru-450 displays similar characteristic diffraction peaks location as CC@WS2. It is noted that the deposition of Ru SAs onto the WS2 does not introduce any diffraction peaks of metallic or oxidized Ru due to the atomic scale of Ru in WS2 and small amount of Ru SAs loading (0.6 wt%).[36]

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were performed to analyze the changes of the surface chemical states of the samples. The XPS survey spectra in Figure S7 of the Supporting Information approves the existence of W, O, C in CC@ WO<sub>3</sub> and W, S, C in CC@WS<sub>2</sub>. Except for the W and S elements, Ru 3p signal with weak intensity appears at around 463 eV in CC@WS2/Ru-450, suggesting the successful introduction of Ru element in WS<sub>2</sub>. Figure 3b shows the high-resolution W 4f spectra of the samples, two typical characteristic peaks at 35.7 and 37.8 eV are attributed to W<sup>6+</sup> species of the W 4f orbital in  $CC@WO_3.^{[37]}$  The O 1s signal of  $CC@WO_3$  in Figure S8 of the Supporting Information could be deconvoluted into two group of species, which are assigned to W-O-W bonds (530.3 eV) and adsorbed hydroxy species on the surface (531.5 eV). After the sulfidation reaction, the W 4f spectrum of CC@WS2 are deconvoluted into two main peaks located at 32.8 and 34.9 eV, corresponding to the  $4f_{7/2}$  and  $4f_{5/2}$  peaks of W<sup>4+</sup> state from WS<sub>2</sub>, respectively.<sup>[38]</sup> Compared with CC@WS<sub>2</sub>, W 4f spectrum of CC@WS<sub>2</sub>/Ru-450 exhibits a shift of 0.15 eV toward lower binding

energy, which may due to the combined effect of the work function change and electron configuration of W and S in CC@WS<sub>2</sub>/ Ru-450.<sup>[30]</sup> Another two peaks at 35.8 and 37.9 eV are W<sup>6+</sup> species resulting from the partial surface oxidation of CC@WS<sub>2</sub>/Ru-450. The XPS spectra in Figure 3c shows an S 2p<sub>3/2</sub>-S 2p<sub>1/2</sub> doublet peaks at 162.4 and 163.6 eV, respectively, are characteristic peaks of S<sup>2-</sup> species in WS<sub>2</sub>. [39] Compared with CC@WS<sub>2</sub>, the S 2p XPS spectra of CC@WS2/Ru-450 also show a negative shift (≈0.10 eV), which mainly because of the same combined effect as those of in W 4f spectra (Figure 3b). [30] Figure 3d presents three typical characteristic peaks at 286.2, 284.6, and 282.0 eV which are assigned to the C-O, C-C (partially overlapping with the Ru  $3d_{3/2}$ ) species in C 1s orbital, and Ru<sup> $\delta$ +</sup> with oxidation state in Ru 3d<sub>5/2</sub> signal for CC@WS<sub>2</sub>/Ru-450, respectively.<sup>[40,41]</sup> Moreover, high-resolution XPS spectrum of Ru 3p signal for CC@WS<sub>2</sub>/Ru-450 was performed to further support the atomic scale of Ru in CC@WS<sub>2</sub>/Ru-450. As shown in Figure S9 of the Supporting Information, the peaks located at 463.1 eV (Ru  $3p_{3/2}$ ) and 485.4 eV (Ru  $3p_{1/2}$ ) are ascribed to the form of Ru $^{\delta+}$

[43] However, the Ru SAs tends to aggregate to nanoclusters when the deposition higher than 450 s as evidenced by the Ru 3d signal for CC@WS<sub>2</sub>/Ru SAs with different deposition time (110, 225, 450, 900, and 1800 s) (Figure S10, Supporting Information), where the Ru<sup>0</sup> signal appears at the deposition time of 900 and 1800 s. The Raman spectroscopies are also conducted to analyze the influences of Ru-doping on the bonding natures of 2H-WS<sub>2</sub>. As shown in Figure 3e, the similar Raman spectra of CC@WS<sub>2</sub>/Ru-450 with that of the CC@WS<sub>2</sub> imply that the 2H-structured WS2 is well retained after singleatom Ru decoration, as evidenced by the typical peaks located at

348.8 ( $E_{2g}^1$ ) and 418.2 cm<sup>-1</sup> ( $A_{1g}$ ). While two weak peaks centered at 321.8 and 397.0 cm<sup>-1</sup> are evolved as the small fraction of J<sub>2</sub> and J<sub>3</sub> vibrations for 1T phase of WS<sub>2</sub>. [44,45] Additionally, a positive shift by 2 cm<sup>-1</sup> is detected in the A<sub>1g</sub> mode of CC@WS<sub>2</sub>/Ru-450, which may due to the structural changes caused by stress during the isolation of Ru SAs in Sv of WS2. [44] The defect-rich structure and electron configuration of WS2/Ru SAs could significantly increase the exposure of S-edges and Ru SAs active sites to the maximum extent and improve electrocatalytic intrinsic activity. The atomic coordination structures of CC@WS2/Ru-450 and CC@WS2 were determined by X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy to further support the Sv and atomic scale of Ru SAs in CC@WS<sub>2</sub>/Ru-450. Figure 3f displays the W L<sub>3</sub>-edge XANES spectra for CC@WS<sub>2</sub>/Ru-450, CC@WS<sub>2</sub>, and W-foil. The absorption-edge of CC@WS2/Ru-450 located

between W-foil and CC@WS2, indicating that the immobilization of Ru SAs in WS2 could induce the electronic configuration between Ru and W, which is agreement with the XPS result. Fourier-transformed (FT) EXAFS shows two peaks at 2.06 and 2.98 Å are assigned to the W-S, and W-W species, respectively for CC@WS2 (Figure 3g).[46] The FT-EXAFS spectrum for CC@ WS<sub>2</sub>/Ru-450 exhibits the weaker W-S peak intensity than that of CC@WS<sub>2</sub>, indicating the formation of more Sv in CC@WS<sub>2</sub>/ Ru-450, which agrees well with EPR result. [43,47] Figure 3h shows the Ru K-edge XANES spectra of CC@WS2/Ru-450, Ru-foil, and RuO<sub>2</sub>, indicating the oxidized valence of Ru in CC@WS<sub>2</sub>/Ru-450 that is situated between R<sup>0</sup> and Ru<sup>4+</sup>, which is in accordance with the XPS results.<sup>[48]</sup> FT-EXAFS analysis at Ru K-edge are performed to elucidate the local coordination environment of the Ru in WS<sub>2</sub>. As shown in Figure 3i, a prominent peak at Ru–W can be recognized at 1.63 Å, a weak peak located at around 2.2 Å could be assigned to the Ru-S (W bridge) interaction. The Ru-Ru peak at 2.33 Å and Ru–O–Ru peak at 3.19 Å disappeared, thus ruling out the existence of metallic Ru and RuO2. [49] The bestfitting of the Ru K-edge EXAFS curves for CC@WS2/Ru-450 shows the Ru bonding coordination number of 3.2  $\pm$  0.5 (Ru–W scattering) (Table S1, Supporting Information), indicating the Ru SAs are immobilized onto the Sv of WS2 and coordinated by three W atoms (Figure S11a, Supporting Information). The wavelet transform (WT) analysis was conducted to further verify the coordination conditions of Ru atoms. The WT intensity maximum of about 3.9 and 10.2  $\mbox{Å}^{-1}$  are assigned to Ru–W and Ru–S (W bridge) coordination, respectively (Figure S11b, Supporting Information). Whereas the intensity maximum at near 8.9 and 5.4 Å<sup>-1</sup> associated with the Ru-Ru and Ru-O coordination in Ru-foil and RuO2, respectively, are not detected (Figure S11c,d, Supporting Information). The above XAS results verify the atomically dispersed of Ru anchored onto the Sv of WS<sub>2</sub> surface and came into interact with W atoms to form stable structure.

#### 2.2. Investigation of Electrochemical HER Performance

The electrochemical HER performance of the samples was tested in 1.0 KOH. A typical three-electrode system was employed with Pt wire and Pt/C as the reference sample. The HER activity of the samples was first performed by the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV). As expected, the CC@WS<sub>2</sub>/ Ru-450 shows the lowest overpotential (32.1 mV) among CC@ WS<sub>2</sub> (205.5 mV) and CC@WO<sub>3</sub> (368.5 mV), and even better than commercial Pt wire (34.2 mV) to reach 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> ( $\eta_{10}$ ) (Figure 4a). This superiority could be larger when increasing the current density, with a low overpotential of only 107.3 mV for CC@WS2/Ru-450, which is much lower than Pt wire (121.9 mV) and Pt/C loaded on CC (CC@Pt/C, 151.8 mV) to deliver the current density of 100 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> ( $\eta_{100}$ ) (Figure S12, Supporting Information). The control tests preliminary confirm the synergy effect of WS2 and Ru SAs in CC@WS2/Ru-450. This performance is superior to many recently reported Ru- or W-based HER electrocatalysts (Table S2, Supporting Information). It should be noted that the sulfidation temperature has a great influence on the HER activity of CC@WS2. As shown in Figure S13 of the Supporting Information, the CC@WS2-700 (sulfidation temperature of 700 °C as noted) shows the lowest  $\eta_{10}$  of 205.5 mV, which is much lower than those of CC@WS<sub>2</sub>-600 (374.9 mV), CC@WS<sub>2</sub>-800 (334.0 mV), and CC@WS<sub>2</sub>-900 (342.6 mV). The SEM images in Figure S14 of the Supporting Information shows that nanosheets and nanowires are coexistence in the CC@WS<sub>2</sub>-600. Compared with 2D nanosheets, the limited exposed active sites on 1D nanowires severely decrease the HER activity. As for CC@WS<sub>2</sub>-800 and CC@WS<sub>2</sub>-900, the sluggish activity mainly comes from the aggregation effect and restacked of nanosheets to larger bulk structures induced by higher-temperature of sulfidation reaction, which blocks many of the active sites and hinders hydrogen production.

The electrocatalytic kinetic rate of HER for the samples were evaluated by Tafel slope, which is obtained by the extrapolation of the linear region of  $\eta$  versus log  $i^{[50]}$  As shown in Figure 4b, Tafel slopes of 53.2, 164.6, 662.6, and 53.1 mV dec<sup>-1</sup> are obtained for CC@WS2/Ru-450, CC@WS2, CC@WO3, and Pt wire, respectively. The CC@WS2/Ru-450 possesses the smallest Tafel slope and closes to the Pt wire, indicating faster kinetics and the Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism dominates the HER process.<sup>[16]</sup> Noting that the Tafel slope of CC@WS<sub>2</sub> is much higher than 120 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>, suggesting the sluggish water adsorption/dissociation process (Volmer) controls the reaction kinetic rate.<sup>[51]</sup> Impressively, the isolation of Ru SAs in WS<sub>2</sub> to form WS<sub>2</sub>/Ru SAs could significantly decrease the Tafel slope to 53.2 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>, implying the sluggish Volmer kinetic of WS<sub>2</sub> may be accelerated by the Ru SAs sites. The faster HER kinetic for CC@WS2/Ru-450 was also assessed by the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and presented in Figure 4c. The charge transfer resistance ( $R_{ct}$ ) of CC@WS<sub>2</sub>/Ru-450 (3.21  $\Omega$ ) is much smaller than that of CC@WS<sub>2</sub> (66.6  $\Omega$ ) and Pt wire (6.29  $\Omega$ ), confirming that the CC@WS<sub>2</sub>/Ru-450 has a fast electron transfer and HER kinetic at the electrolyte/electrocatalyst interface.

The capability of alkaline HER activity for CC@WS<sub>2</sub>/Ru SAs with various amount of anchored Ru atoms were evaluated by simply controlling the deposition time (110, 225, 450, 900, and 1800 s). As shown in Figure 4d, the loading of Ru SAs on WS<sub>2</sub> has a great impact on the HER performance. As expected, the CC@WS<sub>2</sub>/Ru-450 shows the lowest  $\eta_{10}$  of 32.1 mV compared with those of CC@WS<sub>2</sub>/Ru-110 (67.6 mV), CC@WS<sub>2</sub>/Ru-225 (61.5 mV), CC@WS<sub>2</sub>/Ru-900 (63.7 mV), and CC@WS<sub>2</sub>/Ru-1800 (109.5 mV). The increased amount of isolated Ru atoms in WS2 could introduce more active Ru sites to improve the electrochemical HER activity. However, an excess of Ru loading (deposition time higher than 450 s) induces the aggregation of Ru SAs to larger nanoclusters, which, on the contrary, blocks some of the active sites and leads to the HER activity degradation, as evidenced by the XPS analysis (Figure S10, Supporting Information). [52] In addition, the isolated Ru SAs trapped onto the Sv of WS2 even exhibits much higher catalytic activity than the aggregated Ru particles. As shown in Figures S15 and S16 of the Supporting Information, the CC@WS2@Ru NPs possess the  $\eta_{10}$  of 63.3 mV, which is twice higher than that of CC@ WS<sub>2</sub>/Ru-450. The better activity of Ru SAs immobilization rather than Ru NPs loading in the WS2 is due to the synergy effect of the combination of Ru SAs and the WS2 host as well as higher atomic utilization of Ru SAs.[53] The electrochemical surface area (ECSA) is in direct proportion to the electrochemical double-layer capacitance ( $C_{\rm dl}$ ), which was obtained from

the corresponding cyclic voltammetry curves at non-faradic potential with various scan rates (Figure S17, Supporting Information).<sup>[54]</sup> CC@WS<sub>2</sub>/Ru-450 shows the largest C<sub>dl</sub> value of 81.4 mF cm<sup>-2</sup> among all samples, which is about 1.3-, 2-, and 16-fold higher than CC@WS2@Ru NPs (60.9 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>), CC@ WS<sub>2</sub> (39.0 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>), and CC@WO<sub>3</sub> (5.0 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>), respectively (Figure 4e; Figure S17, Supporting Information). This result reveals that the CC@WS2/Ru-450 possesses the largest ECSA, and owning the largest amount of available active sites. The ECSA normalized LSV curves of HER for CC@WS2/ Ru-450 also exhibits higher activity than the reference samples, with a special current density of  $-0.04~\text{mA}~\text{cm}_{\text{ECSA}}^{-2}$ , is about 1.4- and 20-fold that of CC@WS2@Ru NPs and CC@WS2 respectively at 0.2 V, indicating the superior intrinsic activity (Figure S18, Supporting Information). The intrinsic activity of the samples was further evaluated by mass activity normalized with the mass of Ru (the calculation details was provided in the Supporting Information). At the overpotential of 200 mV, CC@WS2/Ru-450 manifests the highest mass activity of

10.4 A  $mg_{Ru}^{-1}$ , which is much higher than that of CC@WS<sub>2</sub>@Ru NPs (5.6 A  $mg_{Ru}^{-1}$ ), demonstrating that the immobilization of single-atom Ru on WS<sub>2</sub> can significantly enhance intrinsic HER activity (Figure 4f).

The stability of samples was measured by chronopotentiometry (CP) test. As shown in Figure 4g, the CP curves of CC@WS<sub>2</sub>/Ru-450 exhibits almost no change of the potential for 100 h at the current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. Despite a slight downtrend is observed, an ultrasmooth potential curves can be obtained over 100 h. The LSV curves obtained after CP test shows only a slight activity attenuation (Figure S19, Supporting Information). By contrast, the reference sample of Pt wire shows an obvious voltage decrease. The content of Ru in CC@WS<sub>2</sub>/Ru-450 were determined to 0.49 wt% based on the inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) analysis after the HER stability tests. The analysis of morphological and structural changes for the CC@WS<sub>2</sub>/Ru-450 was next carried out. XRD and SEM tests indicate that the morphology and structure of CC@WS<sub>2</sub>/Ru-450 have no obvious

change, as evidenced by the well-defined WS<sub>2</sub> phase without the metallic or oxidized Ru, and almost identical cross-linked nanosheets as before (Figure S20a-c, Supporting Information). High-resolution XPS spectrum of Ru 3d signal and TEM/HRTEM images further demonstrate that the Ru valence and the morphology of the catalyst did not change, respectively (Figure S20d-f, Supporting Information). The corresponding HAADF-STEM image and elemental mappings exhibit homogeneous distribution of W, S, and Ru elements on the WS2/Ru (Figure S20g, Supporting Information). These results well demonstrate the structural and morphological stability of CC@WS2/Ru-450 after the long-term CP test of HER. Interestingly, the drastic fluctuation is detected in the LSV curve of CC@WS2@Ru NPs at high current density, which may due to the "bubble shielding effect" (Figure S16, Supporting Information). [16] Because of the sluggish gas releasing capacity of the non-3D structure of CC@WS2@Ru NPs, the produced  $H_2$  is adsorbed on the surface and block the consequent reaction. Impressively, the freestanding 3D-structured CC@WS2/Ru-450 shows smooth LSV curves at large current density, which may take the advantages of the surfacial hydrophilicity to create a low-ohmic-resistive path at the interfaces of electrode/electrolyte, as well as superaerophobic property to facilitate the faster removal of gas bubbles, further promoting the cycling stability of CC@WS $_2$ /Ru-450.[55,56]

#### 2.3. Investigation of Electrochemical HzOR Performance

The electrochemical performance of CC@WS<sub>2</sub>/Ru-450 for HzOR was then evaluated by three-electrode system in N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>/KOH medium. **Figure 5a** shows LSV curves of HzOR for CC@WS<sub>2</sub>/Ru-450 in 1.0  $\,$ M KOH containing various concentrations of hydrazine. A sharp increase of response current is observed when constantly increasing the concentrate of hydrazine in the electrolyte. Specifically, the CC@WS<sub>2</sub>/Ru-450 exhibits a pretty low working potential of –74 mV to achieve the current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> in 0.5  $\,$ M N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> + 1.0  $\,$ M KOH solution. As a sharp contrast, this value is far lower than those of CC@WS<sub>2</sub>@Ru NPs (–60 mV), CC@WS<sub>2</sub> (0.187 V), CC@WO<sub>3</sub> (0.329 V), Pt wire (0.168 V), and even CC@Pt/C (96 mV) (Figure S21,

Supporting Information), indicating the significantly improved HzOR activity by doping Ru SAs in WS2, which implies the important role that Ru atoms take in the HzOR and Ru sites may be the main active centers for HzOR (Figure 5b). The attractive working potential of HzOR for CC@WS2/Ru-450 outperforms the other recently reported counterpart catalysts such as Mo-Ni<sub>3</sub>N/Ni/NF (-0.3 mV)<sup>[2]</sup> and Ni NCNAs (-26 mV)<sup>[57]</sup> (Figure 5g), etc. The detailed working potentials for each catalyst are provided in Table S3 of the Supporting Information. The ECSA normalized LSV curves of HzOR for CC@WS<sub>2</sub>/Ru-450 was evaluated and shown in Figure S22 of the Supporting Information. As expected, at 0.1 V, the CC@WS2/Ru-450 shows a special current density of 0.042 mA cm<sub>ECSA</sub><sup>-2</sup>, which is about 1.6- and 620-fold that of CC@WS2@Ru NPs and CC@WS<sub>2</sub> respectively, confirming the superior intrinsic HzOR activity of CC@WS2/Ru-450. The kinetic rate of HzOR for the samples was evaluated by Tafel slope. As shown in Figure 5c, the corresponding Tafel slope of CC@WS<sub>2</sub>/Ru-450 is 42.2 mV  $dec^{-1}$ , much lower than CC@WS<sub>2</sub>@Ru NPs (77.9 mV  $dec^{-1}$ ),  $CC@WS_2$  (87.1 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>),  $CC@WO_3$  (134.1 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>), and Pt wire (51.8 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>), revealing its faster HzOR kinetic. Moreover, the EIS spectra of CC@WS2/Ru-450 displays the smallest  $R_{ct}$  (1.25  $\Omega$ ) compared with all the samples including CC@WS<sub>2</sub>  $(13.87 \Omega)$ , CC@WO<sub>3</sub>  $(23.85 \Omega)$ , and Pt wire  $(5.37 \Omega)$  (Figure 5d), which resulting from the fast electron transfer kinetics of the CC@WS2/Ru-450 and electrolyte interface. Excitingly, the comparison of HzOR and OER activities for CC@WS2/Ru-450 are performed and shown in Figure 5e. It requires much higher potential of 1.62 V in OER than that of in HzOR (-74 mV) to deliver 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, demonstrating the kinetic advantages of HzOR catalysis and has a great potential to replace OER part for HzOR-assisted OWS. Furthermore, the durability of CC@ WS<sub>2</sub>/Ru-450 was conducted by recording the CP curves at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. Although a slight activity decay is detected at the initial electrolysis (Figure S23, Supporting Information), the working potential value remains basically unchanged over 100 h, which is in striking contrast with the commercial Pt wire with a considerable stability deactivation (Figure 5f). The content of Ru in CC@WS<sub>2</sub>/Ru-450 was determined to 0.46 wt% by the ICP-OES after the HzOR stability test. These results confirm the robust stability of CC@WS2/Ru-450 for HzOR. The morphological and structural characterizations of the CC@WS<sub>2</sub>/ Ru-450 after CP test were performed by SEM, XRD, XPS, TEM, and HAADF-STEM and shown in Figure S24 of the Supporting Information. As shown in Figure S24a of the Supporting Information, only the peaks of 2H-WS<sub>2</sub> are found on the XRD curves and no other Ru related species are detected, preliminarily confirming the atomic scale of Ru SAs in CC@ WS<sub>2</sub>/Ru-450 after the long-term CP test of HzOR. SEM and XPS are further conducted and shown in Figure S24b-d of the Supporting Information. The morphology of CC@WS<sub>2</sub>/Ru-450 remains stable and no other metallic Ru is detected based on the XPS results. Moreover, TEM and HRTEM show nanosheets morphology of WS2 without the agglomerated metallic Ru nanoclusters on the surface of WS2 nanosheets (Figure S24e,f, Supporting Information). The corresponding HAADF-STEM and elemental mappings exhibit homogeneous distribution of W, S, and Ru elements on the WS<sub>2</sub>/Ru (Figure S24g, Supporting Information).

## 2.4. Investigation on the HzOR-Assisted OWS Performance in a Two-Electrode System

Considering the superior HER and HzOR performance of CC@WS2/Ru-450, a two-electrode cell employing CC@WS2/ Ru-450 as a bifunctional catalyst for both anode and cathode for HzOR-assisted OWS was employed and schematically presented in Figure 6a. For comparison, the pure OWS without the addition of N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> for CC@WS<sub>2</sub>/Ru-450 and HzOR-assisted OWS using commercial Pt wire//Pt wire, CC@Pt/C//CC@ Pt/C, and CC@WS2@Ru NPs//CC@WS2@Ru NPs were also measured. Digital photograph of H-type two-electrode electrolyze toward HzOR-assisted OWS during operation is shown in Figure 6b and the vigorous evolution of N2 and H2 gas can be clearly observed. For HzOR-assisted OWS, the two-electrode electrolyzer utilizing Pt wire//Pt wire and CC@Pt/C//CC@ Pt/C electrodes requires much larger cell voltage of 0.34 V and 140 mV to achieve 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> in 0.5 M  $N_2H_4 + 1.0$  M KOH, respectively (Figure S25, Supporting Information). While the CC@WS2/Ru-450//CC@WS2/Ru-450 delivers an ultralow cell voltage of only 15.4 mV at the same current density and requires low voltage of 0.31 V to achieve high current density of 200 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. For pure OWS without N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>, a much higher cell voltage of 1.72 V is obtained for CC@WS2/Ru-450//CC@ WS<sub>2</sub>/Ru-450, illustrating the distinctly reduced electric power using HzOR-assisted OWS system (Figure 6c). The remarkable activity of CC@WS2/Ru-450 outperforms CC@WS2@Ru NPs//CC@WS<sub>2</sub>@Ru NPs (86.6 mV), benchmark Pt catalysts, CC//CC substrate, and most of the recently reported robust electrocatalysts for OWS-assisted OWS such as Ni<sub>3</sub>N-Co<sub>3</sub>N (71 mV)<sup>[12]</sup> and RuP<sub>2</sub> (23 mV)<sup>[1]</sup> (Figure 6e). For comprehensive comparison, more details are provided in Table S4 of the Supporting Information. Besides, the two-electrode HzOR-assisted OWS of CC@WS<sub>2</sub>/Ru-450//CC@WS<sub>2</sub>/Ru-450 presents a ultralong robust durability with a negligible deactivation over 100 h at the current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, whereas Pt wire//Pt wire suffers severe activity decay and curve fluctuation at the initial electrolysis, revealing the excellent gas release capacity and durability of CC@WS2/Ru-450, as evidenced by the contact angle test (only 16° as noted) (Figure 6d). Moreover, the Faradic efficiency of the hydrogen production on CC@WS<sub>2</sub>/ Ru-450 during HzOR-assisted OWS was evaluated and shown in Figure S26 of the Supporting Information. The theoretical amount of H2 matched well with that of experimentally generated during the HzOR-assisted OWS process, revealing near 100% Faradic efficiency for hydrogen production in HzORassisted OWS system. The extraordinary HzOR-assisted OWS performance of CC@WS2/Ru-450 illustrates the feasibility for potential practical applications.

#### 2.5. Investigation of the Critical Role of Ru SAs in HER and HzOR

To unravel the possible roles of Ru SAs and WS $_2$  sites for both alkaline HER and HzOR and explain the details of the MSI effect on CC@WS $_2$ /Ru SAs bifunctional catalyst, DFT calculations were further performed. The optimized 2H-WS $_2$  (002) with one Sv (Sv-WS $_2$ ) and one Ru atom anchored onto Sv of Sv-WS $_2$  (Sv-WS $_2$ /Ru SA) were used as the active surfaces (**Figure 7**a).

The corresponding stability of the proposed Sv-WS<sub>2</sub>/Ru structure was supported by subtracting the sum of energies of the free Sv-WS<sub>2</sub> surface and the isolated Ru atom from the energy of Sv-WS<sub>2</sub>/Ru, is as low as –4.85 eV, implying a stable structure of Sv-WS<sub>2</sub>/Ru and indicating strong chemical interaction between the Ru single atom and the Sv-WS<sub>2</sub> surface, accounting for its robust stability observed experimentally (Figure S27,

Supporting Information).<sup>[58]</sup> This result is in accordance with the report that the single metal atoms could readily moves to the Sv of 2D metals disulfides with much lower adsorption energy and form stable structure.<sup>[58]</sup> Since the electron configuration is closely connected with the H\* adsorption capacity during HER, the electron density differences of Sv-WS<sub>2</sub> and Sv-WS<sub>2</sub>/Ru SA were first investigated. As shown in Figure 7b, the red

region indicates charge accumulation and blue region indicates charge loss. With the creation of Sv in WS2, the residual electrons restrained at the Sv prefer to flow toward the surrounding W atoms. With single-atom Ru anchored onto the Sv of WS2, the MSI induces a strong redistribution of the charge density near the Ru atom, and the electrons are lost in Sv and accumulate around the Ru atom (Figure 7b). The localized structural polarization induced electron-rich Ru sites environment benefits for boosting the water dissociation kinetic to cleavage of OH bond.[18] The electron redistribution induced by MSI effect in Sv-WS2/Ru SAs affects the partial density of states. Accordingly, the *d*-band center (*ε*d) is utilized to unravel the interaction between intermediate species and active centers. Compared with *ε*d of Sv-WS2 (−3.206 eV), the s–p orbital of S atoms (adjusted to Ru) in Sv-WS2/Ru SAs possesses the lower *ε*d position of −4.303 eV (Figure 7c). Based on the *d*-bond center theory, the downshift of *ε*d manifests that Sv-WS2/Ru SAs has a weaker interaction with the intermediate adsorbates.[59] To further reveal the HER efficiency, the Gibbs free energy of H\* (Δ*G*H\*) is introduced as a descriptor to evaluate HER activity and an ideal catalyst should have an optimized Δ*G*H\* to thermoneutrality (Δ*G*H\* = 0).[60] The difference of electronic structure in Sv-WS2 and Sv-WS2/Ru SAs may alter the hydrogen absorption capacity. Therefore, a series of Δ*G*H\* were calculated and shown in Figure 7d. The corresponding H\* adsorption model structures are provided in Figure S28 of the Supporting Information. The Δ*G*H\* of Sv-WS2 on Sv site is as low as −0.74 eV, which means that its strong adsorption strength of H\* would block the active sites. After the immobilization of Ru atoms, the Sv-WS2/Ru SAs exhibits improved Δ*G*H\* of −0.64 eV on the Ru site. Impressively, the S site (adjusted to Ru) of Sv-WS2/ Ru SAs exhibits the most optimized Δ*G*H\* with more moderate adsorption energy of −0.21 eV, indicating the S sites in Sv-WS2/ Ru SAs are inclined to promote Heyrovsky step. Actually, the

water adsorption and dissociation (Volmer) reaction are considered as critical RDS in alkaline HER,[61] and the Volmer pathway of water dissociation on Sv-WS2 and Sv-WS2/Ru SAs were then calculated. The corresponding adsorption models of H2O, OH<sup>−</sup>, and H\* species are listed in Figure S29 of the Supporting Information. As shown in Figure 7e, the energy barrier of HOH cleavage in adsorbed water molecular on Sv site of Sv-WS2 is 2.42 eV, such a relatively high barrier induces sluggish Volmer reaction. Whereas the activation barrier of Ru site in Sv-WS2/Ru SAs is reduced to 2.02 eV. This reveals that the Ru atoms sites in Sv-WS2/Ru SAs are more favorable for the dissociation ability of water molecule to H\*. Based on the above results, the active Ru sites could substantially facilitate the dissociation of water to OH<sup>−</sup> and H\* in Volmer reaction. Meanwhile, the MSI effect induced localized structural polarization achieves favorable H\* adsorption on S sites (adjusted to Ru) in Heyrovsky step to promote alkaline HER.

Considering the limited researches on the HzOR activity for Ru SAs-based catalysts, it is more meaningful to gain deep insight into the fundamental mechanism of dehydrogenation kinetics in Sv-WS2/Ru SAs via DFT calculations. Based on the AC HAADF-STEM result, the dehydrogenation steps of hydrazine were analyzed over (002) plane of Sv-WS2/Ru SAs and Sv-WS2. The experimental results reveal that the Sv-WS2 with the absence of Ru SAs exhibits the dramatical decrease of HzOR activity (Figure 5b), implying that the Ru SAs may be the active centers to promote HzOR. As a proof-of-concept, the free energy profiles of stepwise dehydrogenation processes of hydrazine over Ru site of Sv-WS2/Ru SAs and Sv site of Sv-WS2 were investigated (Figure 7f; Figure S30, Supporting Information). Specifically, the absorption energy of N2H4 on the Ru site of Sv-WS2/Ru SAs (−2.20 eV) is lower than that of Sv-WS2 (−1.19 eV), indicating the more adsorption capacity of N2H4 on Ru site. The much larger distance (3.05 Å) between H atom in hydrazine and nearest S site in Sv-WS2 than that of Sv-WS2/Ru SAs (2.28 Å) between Ru and N atoms further suggests more thermodynamically favorable adsorption of hydrazine on Ru sites. The calculation results propose that the dehydrogenation from \*N2H4 to \*N2H3 is the RDS over Ru site on Sv-WS2/Ru SAs with a limiting barrier of 0.46 eV, which is 0.50 eV smaller than that of Sv site in Sv-WS2 (0.96 eV), revealing that the Ru atom is the active site in Sv-WS2/Ru SAs for fulfilling the multistep dehydrogenation reaction of HzOR. This conclusion is in line with the experimental observation. Overall, these results manifest that the immobilization of Ru SAs onto the Sv of WS2 could significantly promote both alkaline HER and HzOR, as the Ru atoms could be bifunctional active centers to reduce the barrier of key RDS for Volmer reaction in alkaline HER and dehydrogenation reaction in HzOR, thus facilitates the thermodynamics and dynamics behaviors of both HER and HzOR (Figure 7g).

## **3. Conclusion**

In summary, our experimental observations and DFT calculations indicated that the catalytic performances of alkaline HER and HzOR for 2H-WS2 surface can be significantly promoted by homogeneous immobilization of Ru SAs onto the Sv of WS2

via facile galvanostatic deposition strategy. Specifically, it can deliver a low *η*10 of only 32.1 mV with a small Tafel slope of 53.2 mV dec<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> in the presence of hydrazine. The CC@WS2/Ru SAs exhibits excellent activity that is far beyond the commercial Pt, as evidenced by ultralow working potential of −74 mV for the HzOR in 0.5 m N2H4 + 1.0 m KOH medium. As the efficient bifunctional catalyst, the assembled HzOR-assisted OWS electrolyzer system using CC@WS2/Ru SAs as both anode and cathode electrodes merely requires a remarkable low cell voltage of 15.4 mV to achieve 10 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> , and maintains stable hydrogen production over 100 h. DFT calculations reveal that the precise location of Ru atoms in Sv in WS2 as the bifunctional active species can lower the barrier of critical RDS of both Volmer reaction in alkaline HER and dehydrogenation reaction in HzOR. This work provides a deeper insight into the mechanistic understanding of SACs as bifunctional active species toward HzOR and HER, and sheds new lights on precise materials design strategies for advanced HzOR-assisted OWS system.

Typically, the as-prepared CC@WS $_2$  was used as working electrode, high-purity graphite rod was counter electrode. The Ru SAs deposition was conducted in the electrolyte containing RuCl $_3$ :xH $_2$ O (3 × 10<sup>-3</sup> м) and NH $_2$ SO $_3$ H (30 × 10<sup>-3</sup> м) at a current density of –0.2 mA cm $^{-2}$ . [16] The mass loading of Ru SAs in WS $_2$  was controlled by regulating the deposition time (110, 225, 450, 900, and 1800 s).

Preparation of CC@WS2@Ru NPs: The WO3 powder was prepared by the same method as CC@WO3 without the addition of CC. Then the sulfidation process was performed with the similar procedure as CC@ WS<sub>2</sub> and the only difference is the absence of CC in this section. After the sulfidation reaction, the black WS<sub>2</sub> powder was obtained. The WS<sub>2</sub>@ Ru NPs was prepared by chemical reduction method. WS<sub>2</sub> powder was dispersed in 15 mL aqueous solution containing  $6.0 \times 10^{-3}$  M RuCl<sub>3</sub>·xH<sub>2</sub>O and sonicating for 30 min. Then 5.0 mL NaBH<sub>4</sub> aqueous solution (5.0 mg mL<sup>-1</sup>) was dropped slowly in the above WS<sub>2</sub>/Ru<sup>3+</sup> suspension and stirred overnight. The resultant WS2@Ru NPs solid was filtered and washed with ethanol and deionized water several times and dried in vacuum oven for 3 h. Then the WS2@Ru NPs was redispersed in ethanol solution containing Nafion binder, a piece of cleaned CC was then put at the bottom of the WS2@Ru NPs suspension and dried at 60 °C overnight, the loading of Ru NPs and WS2@Ru NPs on CC was controlled the same as CC@WS<sub>2</sub>/Ru SAs.

Preparation of CC@Pt/C: The commercial 20% Pt/C powder was dispersed in the solution containing ethanol and Nafion binder and spin-coating on the CC homogeneously. Then the obtained CC@Pt/C was dried in the vacuum oven overnight.

Materials Characterizations: The morphological images of the samples were obtained by using SEM (Hitachi, SU8010). The crystal structures of samples were characterized by XRD (Bruker D8 Advance). TEM and HRTEM images were obtained by FEI Talos F200X. HAADF-STEM, EDS, and elemental mappings were conducted by FEI Themis Z and Titan Cubed Themis G2300. The elemental valance and coordination environment of Ru SAs, W, and S were determined by XPS (Thermo Scientific Nexsa), the binding energy of XPS spectra were calibrated based on the C 1s peak energy located at 284.6 eV. [22] Raman spectra were captured by a Thermo Dxr 2Xi. The Sv of the samples were detected by EPR (Bruker, E500-9.5/12). The content of Ru SAs in the samples was measured by (ICP-OES, PerkinElmer, Optima 2100DV). The contact angle test was conducted by contact goniometer (JY-82B Kruss DSA).

Electrochemical Characterizations: All the electrochemical tests were conducted by CHI760E electrochemical workstation. The alkaline HER and HzOR measurements were performed with a three-electrode system at ambient temperature. The as-prepared freestanding samples were working electrode, high-purity graphite rod and Hg/HgO (1.0 M KOH filler) were counter and reference electrodes, respectively. The electrochemical tests were conducted in 1.0  $\,\mathrm{M}$  KOH for HER or 1.0  $\,\mathrm{M}$  $KOH + N_2H_4$  with various concentrations (0.05, 0.1, 0.3, and 0.5 M) in HzOR. The LSV measurements were performed at a sweep rate of 2.0 mV  $s^{-1}$ . The stability test was tested by the CP method with iRcorrection at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. EIS was carried out from 100 kHz to 0.1 Hz at an overpotential of 200 mV. All the potential was iR corrected and converted into RHE based on the equation: E(RHE) = E(Hg/HgO) +0.095 + 0.059 pH. The HzOR-assisted OWS experiments were performed in a H-type two-electrode cell, the AEM was used to divide anode and cathode and allows anion to transfer. The as-prepared samples were both anode and cathode and filled with 1.0 m KOH + 0.5 m  $N_2H_4$  and 1.0 m KOH, respectively.

Theoretical Calculations: DFT calculations were performed using Dmol³ package of Materials Studio program.  $^{[62]}$  The exchange correlation interactions were treated by generalized gradient approximation function employed by the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof correlation function. The real-space global orbital cutoff was set to 4.9 Å. The geometrical optimization of the structures was performed with a convergence criterion of  $10^{-5}$  Hartree. Self-consistent field procedure was conducted on all atoms until the change of energy was  $>10^{-6}$  Hartree. A vacuum region of 15 Å was set to eliminate negligible interaction between WS $_2$  and its periodic images. The Brillouin zone was sampled by a  $2\times2\times1$  k-points generated

within the Monkhorst–Pack scheme. The surface adsorption model of WS $_2$  (002) plane with one Sv, and one Ru atom dopant in Sv of WS $_2$  were used to present the Sv-WS $_2$  and Sv-WS $_2/Ru$  SAs, respectively. Linear Synchronous Transit/Quadratic Synchronous Transit transition state search was applied and the transition state confirmation calculation was conducted to validate the transition state. Gibbs free energy of hydrogen atom adsorption ( $\Delta G_{H^*}$ ) on the surface was calculated by the equation:  $\Delta G_{H^*} = E[\text{surface} + H^*] - E[\text{surface}] - 1/2E[H_2] + \Delta E_{ZPE} - T\Delta S_H$ , where the  $E[\text{surface} + H^*]$  is the total energy of slab with adsorbate, [surface] is the energy of slab,  $E[H_2]$  represents total energy of H $_2$  gas phase,  $\Delta E_{ZPE}$  is the zero-point energy, and  $-T\Delta S_H$  is entropy at 298 K. The  $\Delta E_{ZPE} - T\Delta S_H$  can be simplified as 0.25 eV. Gibbs Information.

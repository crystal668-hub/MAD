# **Electrocatalytic Behavior of Manganese and Cobalt Porphyrins Attached to Graphene Quantum Dots: Applied in the Oxidation of Hydrazine**

Mbulelo Jokazi,[a] Lekhetho S. Mpeta,[a] and Tebello Nyokong\*[a]

**Abstract:** Manganese and cobalt metalated 5, 10, 15 tris(aminophenyl)-20-(4-carboxyphenyl) porphyrins (ClMnTA3CPP and CoTA3CPP) were synthesized and attached to graphene quantum dots (GQDs) via π-π interaction and electrostatic interaction. The electrochemical oxidation of hydrazine was performed via cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry. The CoTA3CPP showed good electrocatalytic activity towards the oxidation of hydrazine in terms of catalytic rate constants and limits of detection (LoD). ClMnTA3CPP showed lower overpotential 0.60 V. The introduction of GQDs improved the electrocatalytic ability when combined with CoTA3CPP and ClMnTA3CPP with the lowest LoD (0.0025 mM CoTA3CPP–GQDs) followed by ClMnTA3CPP–GQDs with 0.0033 mM.

## **1 Introduction**

Metallo porphyrins containing paramagnetic central metals are widely employed for electrocatalysis for both reduction and oxidation reactions [1–5]. Good electrocatalysts should lower the redox potential, increase sensitivity and selectivity, and should show good stability [6, 7]. Metallo porphyrin complexes have many advantages which include good stability at various pHs, are cheap and easy to synthesize, and they lower overpotentials and increase currents [4, 5]. During electrocatalysis metallo porphyrin complexes can change their oxidation state but retain their stability and molecular structure [1]. Moreover, they enhance the electron transfer kinetics of several electroactive species [4]. In this work we employ asymmetrically substituted Co and Mn porphyrins, containing three NH2 (push) and one COOH (pull). Pairing electron-donating groups with electronwithdrawing groups often induces a push-pull effect which has been reported to enhance electron delocalization, thus electron transfer properties of complexes [8], hence a push-pull system is employed in this work. A Mn teraaminophenyl porphyrin (MnTAPP) has been employed in the presence of graphene oxide for electrocatalysis [9]. We have recently reported on the electrocatalytic activity of a symmetric MnTAPP in the presence of graphene quantum dots (GQDs) [10]. In this work we employ asymmetric Co and Mn porphyrins since asymmetry is known to improve electrocatalysis in porphyrin-type complexes [11,12]. The asymmetrical porphyrins are assembled onto GQDs in this work.

GQDs are small graphene fragments which contain a diverse range of oxygen containing groups [13]. GQDs are similar to graphene oxide, but have particular properties like photoluminescence [14]. Recent studies have shown that GQDs have a potential to improve electrocatalytic activity and bring high speed electron transport when applied to electrochemistry (sensing) [15,16]. GQDs, as with other graphene-based nanostructures, have been proven to improve conductivity, increase surface area, provide stability and retain the catalytic activity of the molecules they are linked to [17], hence they are employed in this work to improve the electrocatalytic activity of the asymmetrical porphyrins.

Hydrazine is a highly toxic inorganic compound which is one of the most analyzed in the industrial and environmental samples owing to its toxic effect on humans [18,19]. The maximum recommended level of hydrazine in effluents is 1 ppm, however industrial workers in close contact with hydrazine during routine maintenance tasks can be exposed to levels higher than the exposure limit [18,20]. For these reasons, a sensitive method is required for reliable measurements.

In this study, manganese and cobalt metalated 5, 10, 15-tris(aminophenyl)-20-(4-carboxyphenyl) porphyrin (ClMnTA3CPP and CoTA3CPP) are prepared and attached to GQDs via π-π stacking to give ClMnTA3CPP– GQDs and CoTA3CPP–GQDs, respectively and are employed for hydrazine detection.

#### 2.3.2 Graphene Quantum Dots

GQDs were synthesized using the well-known hydrothermal method taken from literature [22]. Briefly, 4.2 g (1 mmol) citric acid and 2.4 g (3 mmol) NaOH were dissolved in 100 mL water. The solution was transferred into a 400 mL Teflon lined stainless autoclave and heated to  $160\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  for 4 h. The final product was precipitated in ethanol and centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 15 min. The solid was re-dispersed into water and was dialyzed for two days using dialysis membrane (MW 1.5 kDa) to remove excess salts

## 2.3.3 Incorporation of Porphyrins to GQDs

The attachment of the synthesized ClMnTA<sub>3</sub>CPP and CoTA<sub>3</sub>CPP to GQDs Scheme 1(B) was through  $\pi$ - $\pi$  interaction following the method reported in our previous study [10]. Briefly the porphyrins (19.0 mg, 0.023 mmol for ClMnTA<sub>3</sub>CPP, and 19.2 mg, 0.025 mmol for CoTA<sub>3</sub>CPP) were dissolved in DMF (3 mL), followed by addition of GQDs solution (15 mg/3 mL) in water. The mixtures were sonicated for 4 h at room temperature and then stirred for 24 h. The products were precipitated with ethanol and washed several times with chloroform and water, followed by drying to give porphyrin–GQDs (Scheme 1B). The amino groups of the substituents on the porphyrins are capable of acquiring positive charges at

physiological pH [23]. Thus, due to the presence of carboxylic and hydroxylic groups on the surface of GQDs and the positively charged amino groups on the porphyrin, there is a possibility of the formation of porphyrin–GQDs hybrid due to the electrostatic interaction between the negatively charged GQDs and the positively charged porphyrin. Therefore, the incorporation of porphyrin to GQDs was achieved through  $\pi$ - $\pi$  and electrostatic interaction.

#### 2.4 Electrode Modification

The glassy carbon electrode (GCE) was used as a working electrode, platinum wire as a counter electrode and silver silver chloride (3 M KCl) as the reference electrode. The GCE was polished to a silver mirror on a Buehler felt pad using alumina ( $<10 \,\mu$ m) and washed with Millipore water and then sonicated in water for 5 min to remove impurities. The electrode was modified using the dropand-dry method. The modification of electrodes was as

follows:  $5 \,\mu\text{L}$  (1 mg/mL, all in DMF except GQDs alone, which was in water) each of GQDs, ClMnTA<sub>3</sub>CPP, CoTA<sub>3</sub>CPP, ClMnTA<sub>3</sub>CPP–GQDs, and CoTA<sub>3</sub>CPP–GQDs, were dropped on the GCE and dried at  $70\,^{\circ}\text{C}$ . All the modified electrodes were then used to perform cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and chronoamperometry. Solutions for electrochemical experiments were deaerated by bubbling argon gas prior to the experiments and the electrochemical cell was kept under argon atmosphere throughout the experiments.

#### 3 Results and Discussion

analysis, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). Molecular ion peak for CoTA<sub>3</sub>CPP was observed at m/z=761.36 in the mass spectrum. For ClMnTA<sub>3</sub>CPP, was observed at m/z = 756.75 corresponding to the loss of the axial ligand, Figure S1, Supporting Information. IR spectra are shown in Figure S2. In CoTA<sub>3</sub>CPP the stretching vibration peaks around 3310, 1647, and 1105 cm<sup>-1</sup> are due to OH, C=O and C-O, respectively, of the carboxylic group. The stretching peak at 3220 is attributed to N-H of the pyrrole ring of the porphyrin. The stretching vibration at 1633, and 1380 cm<sup>-1</sup> correspond to C-H, and C-N respectively. Similarly, ClMnTA<sub>3</sub>CPP showed peaks at 3326, 1617, 1096 cm<sup>-1</sup> which are attributed to OH, C=O and C-O, respectively, of the carboxylic group carboxylic group. The N-H, C=C, and C-N peaks appeared at 3214, 1460, and 1380 respectively [24–26].

EDS characterization was conducted to determine the elemental composition of the metallo porphyrins alone and when with GQDs, Figure S3. The results obtained showed the expected elements. The attachment of porphyrins to GQDs via non-covalent attachment is represented in Scheme 1B, with the possibility of electrostatic attraction.

#### 3.1.1 UV-Vis

The metalated products were confirmed by UV-vis spectroscopy Figure 1. and Figure S4 (Supporting Information). The free base porphyrin TA<sub>3</sub>CPP showed an absorption band at 422 nm (Soret band) and four bands at 515, 549, 588, and 642 nm (Q bands) which is a characteristic of a free base porphyrin, Table 1 [27]. After metalation, the Soret band shifted to the red and a collapse of four Q bands of free base to two of metallated porphyrins was observed [28]. In addition, ClMnTA<sub>3</sub>CPP showed charge transfer transition peaks at 426, 384 and 352 nm which are typical of Mn porphyrins [29]. GQDs showed an absorption band at 332 nm similar to the reported GQDs [30]. The attachment of metal porphyrin to GQDs resulted into blue shift of the Soret band (Table 1) which is an indication of a strong interaction between GQDs and metal porphyrin [31].

#### 3.1.2 XRD

XRD patterns of the samples are shown in Figure 2. The sharp peaks between  $2\theta = 12^{\circ}$  and  $2\theta = 50^{\circ}$  in CoTA<sub>3</sub>CPP and ClMnTA<sub>3</sub>CPP are a representation of the crystallinity of the metal porphyrins. For XRD experiment, two drops of DMF were added onto the porphyrins to make a paste. Solvation of porphyrins results in aggregation which may in turn result in self assembled aggregation. Porphyrins

normally show amorphous peaks [32] however solvated porphyrins have elements of crystallinity [33]. GQDs displayed a broad peak at  $2\theta = 22^{\circ}$  corresponding to (002) plane [34,35]. The sharp peaks from CoTA<sub>3</sub>CPP and ClMnTA<sub>3</sub>CPP were still observed after combining them with GQDs but reduced in intensity, indicating the presence of both GQDs and CoTA<sub>3</sub>CPP. The broad (002) peak of GQDs shifted to lower angles after combining with porphyrin. This relates to the widening of the interlayer distance in GQDs, due to porphyrin intercalation [36].

#### 3.1.3 DLS and TEM

Dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements were carried out to determine the hydrodynamic sizes of the metal porphyrins, GQDs and conjugates Figure 3. The hydrodynamic sizes for CoTA<sub>3</sub>CPP and ClMnTA<sub>3</sub>CPP were found to be 1.29 nm and 1.12 nm, respectively. The hydrodynamic size for GQDs was found to be 6.50 nm. The presence of oxygen functionalities such as carboxyl and hydroxyl groups on the graphene sheets alters the Van de Waals interaction between the layers and make them hydrophilic, as a result GQDs form stable colloidal dispersion in water [37,38]. Hence GQDs were dissolved in water for DLS measurements. After combining the metal porphyrin with GQDs, the size increased to 18.20 nm for CoTA<sub>3</sub>CPP-GQDs and 15.70 nm for ClMnTA<sub>3</sub>CPP-GQD. The increase in size could be due to aggregation [39]. The aromatic groups in the GQDs sheets induce a homogeneous distribution of porphyrin over the

GQDs surface through  $\pi$ - $\pi$  stacking however, there is a preferential distribution of porphyrin through electrostatic interactions between the carboxylic groups at the edges of GQDs structure and the positively charged groups (as discussed above) of the porphyrin forming a hybrid [40]. The strong interaction between porphyrin and GQDs results in an aggregated colloid. However, the electrostatic repulsion between the negatively charged carboxyl groups of GQDs and the COOH group of the porphyrin recovers colloidal stability and prevents further aggregation [41]. TEM images and size distribution of GQDs and their combination with metal porphyrin are shown in Figure 4. The TEM average size for GQDs was found to be 4.28 nm with a circular shape, there was a size increase after combining with metal porphyrins. DLS sizes are normally larger in comparison to those determined by TEM since DLS tends to be skewed towards larger particles [42].

## 3.2 Characterization of Modified Electrode

#### 3.2.1 Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) and EIS in Ferricyanide

Cyclic voltammetric studies were performed for bare and modified electrodes in 1 mM  $[Fe(CN)_6]^{3-/4-}$  in 0.1 M KCl, Figure 5. The anodic and cathodic peak potential separation ( $\Delta$ Ep) values are shown in Table 2. The  $\Delta$ Ep closer to the Nernstian value 58 mV indicates good electron transfer kinetics. The obtained  $\Delta$ Ep are in the order 68 mV < 124 < 150 mV < 187 mV < 231 mV < 276 mV for bare, ClMnTA<sub>3</sub>CPP–GQDs, ClMnTA<sub>3</sub>CPP, CoTA<sub>3</sub>CPP–

GQDs, CoTA<sub>3</sub>CPP, and GQDs respectively. The value of  $\Delta$ Ep for bare GCE was found to be the closest to 58 mV indicating their good charge transfer kinetics for the  $[Fe(CN)_6]^{3-/4-}$ . The observed changes for the modified electrodes confirm change on the GCE surface. Moreover  $\Delta$ Ep of both CoTA<sub>3</sub>CPP and ClMnTA<sub>3</sub>CPP decreased after attachment to GQDs confirming improved charge transfer ability. We also noted that ClMnTA<sub>3</sub>CPP has

better electron transfer ability than CoTA<sub>3</sub>CPP when alone or in the presence of GQDs.

The active area of the electrode was calculated using the Randles-Sevcik Eqn. 1, and using  $[Fe(CN)_6]^{3-/4-}$  in 0.1 M KCl.

$$I_p = 2.69 \times 10^5 n^{3/2} \ ACD^{\frac{1}{2}} \ v^{1/2} \tag{1}$$

where  $I_p\!=\!is$  the peak current,  $A\!=\!the$  effective surface area,  $C\!=\!concentration$  of  $[Fe(CN)_6]^{3-/4},~D\!=\!diffusion$  coefficient  $7.6\!\times\!10^{-6}\,cm^2\!/s$  of  $[Fe(CN)_6]^{3-/4}$  [43],  $n\!=\!the$  number of electrons involved, and v=scan rate. The calculated effective surface areas from Eqn. 1 were found to be 0.097 cm², 0.085 cm², 0.076 cm², 0.069 cm², 0.061 cm² for ClMnTA\_3CPP, CoTA\_3CPP, CoTA\_3CPP–GQDs, GQDs, and ClMnTA\_3CPP–GQDs respectively.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was carried out to study the charge transfer kinetics occurring at the electrode. The Nyquist plots provided in Figure 6 are used to study the impendence behavior [44]. Electron

transfer resistance ( $R_{ct}$ ) can be determined from Nyquist plots. High  $R_{ct}$  signifies that the electrode has low conductivity and/or surface composition that reduces the charge transfer. The  $R_{ct}$  values obtained via Randles model are as follows, bare (1.61 K $\Omega$ ), ClMnTA<sub>3</sub>CPP-GQDs (3.99 K $\Omega$ ), ClMnTA<sub>3</sub>CPP (7.28 K $\Omega$ ), CoTA<sub>3</sub>CPP-GQDs (8.02 K $\Omega$ ), CoTA<sub>3</sub>CPP (9.45 K $\Omega$ ), and GQDs (13.0 K $\Omega$ ), Table 2. ClMnTA<sub>3</sub>CPP showed better conductivity than CoTA<sub>3</sub>CPP. Of all the modified electrodes, ClMnTA<sub>3</sub>CPP-GQDs showed the best charge transfer kinetics with the lowest  $R_{ct}$ . Moreover, introduction of

GQDs to CoTA<sub>3</sub>PP and ClMnTA<sub>3</sub>CPP lowered the R<sub>ct</sub>. The non-covalent functionalization of GQDs and porphyrin combine their properties without interrupting their physical properties [36], this includes improved wettability due to the functional groups on the surface of GQDs [45].

#### 3.2.2. Cyclic Voltammetry in 0.1 M NaOH

The CV scans in 0.1 M NaOH of bare and modified electrodes are shown in Figure 7. The peaks appearing at 0.13 V and -0.35 V in CoTA<sub>3</sub>CPP are due to the

porphyrin ring based and the Co(ll)/Co(l) redox processes, respectively [46]. In ClMnTA<sub>3</sub>CPP we observed a peak at 0.43 V attributed to the porphyrin ring and another peak at -0.12 due to Mn(lll)/Mn(ll) processes [47]. These peaks were also observed in the presence of GQDs but were reduced in intensity due to the covering of the metal porphyrin by GQDs since the latter are of much larger size. In addition, GQDs alone showed a near -0.4 which was expected for GQDs [48]. This peak is due to the reduction of the oxygen containing groups on the GQDs surface [49,50]. Compared to GQDs alone CoTA<sub>3</sub>CPP-GQDs and ClMnTA<sub>3</sub>CPP-GQDs show slightly lower capacitance, in Figure 7. The decrease could be due to restacking of graphene sheets as reported in literature [51]. The peaks observed at the negative potentials between -0.30 V and -0.4 V were employed for the determination of surface coverage Eqn. 2,

$$\Gamma = \frac{Q}{nE\Delta} \tag{2}$$

where Q is the integrated charge, n the number of electrons transferred, F the Faraday constant (96,485 Cmol<sup>-1</sup>), A is the effective surface area obtained from Eqn. (1) and Γ is the surface coverage. The surface coverage values are presented in Table 2. CoTA<sub>3</sub>CPP showed higher surface coverage compared to ClMnTA<sub>3</sub>CPP. Surface coverage values are reduced after introducing GQDs in both CoTA<sub>3</sub>CPP–GQDs and

ClMnTA<sub>3</sub>CPP-GQDs indicating that GQDs is negatively affecting the electron transfer rate.

### 3.3 Hydrazine Detection

#### 3.3.1 Cyclic Voltammetry

Figure 8. shows the cyclic voltammetry response of all probes in 0.1 M NaOH containing 1 mM Hydrazine. Table 3. provides a summary of the results obtained during the electro-oxidation of hydrazine. For all probes we observed only the anodic peak was observed with no evidence of a cathodic peak, which is an indication of an irreversible behavior [52]. Comparing the oxidation peak potential of ClMnTA<sub>3</sub>CPP (0.60 V) to the previously studied Mn tetraaminophenyl porphyrin (MnTAPP) at 0.65 V [10], Table 3, we could conclude that the lowering of the oxidation peak potential is due to the presence of electron withdrawing and electron donating groups on the metal porphyrin.

In terms of the anodic peak current, CoTA<sub>3</sub>CPP showed the higher current compared to ClMnTA<sub>3</sub>CPP. This could be due to the high active surface area of the electrode and the catalytic ability of CoTA<sub>3</sub>CPP. In the presence of GQDs we observed a decrease in anodic peak current in CoTA<sub>3</sub>CPP–GQDs compared to CoTA<sub>3</sub>CPP, corresponding to a decrease in surface coverage. However, the current was increased for ClMnTA<sub>3</sub>CPP–GQDs compared to ClMnTA<sub>3</sub>CPP, even though there was a decrease in surface coverage. The introduction of GQDs

is known to increase the catalytic current [10], we can attribute the decrease in anodic peak current to aggregation as observed in TEM Figure 4.

The mechanism for the oxidation of hydrazine for Mn porphyrin is similar to the one reported for Mn phthalocyanines [53], as follows, equations 3–5.

$$Mn(lll)TAPP + N_2H_4 \rightarrow [Mn(ll)TAPP]^- ... [N_2H_4]^+$$
 (3)

$$[Mn(ll)TAPP]^{-}...[N_{2}H_{4}]^{+} + OH^{-}$$
  

$$\leftrightarrow Mn(lll)TAPP...N_{2}H_{3} + H_{2}O + e^{-}$$
(4)

$$Mn(lll)TAPP \dots N_2H_3 + OH^-$$

$$\rightarrow$$
 H<sub>2</sub>O + Mn(lll)TAPP + N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> + e<sup>-</sup>

Equation (5) is rate determining step.

It has been reported that  $N_2H_2$  further decomposes rapidly via two one-electron steps to give  $N_2$  which is the final product and also that Mn(lll)TAPP/Mn(ll)TAPP mediate the electrocatalysis of hydrazine [53]. This peak was observed in the supporting electrolyte NaOH, Figure 7.

The proposed mechanism for hydrazine oxidation is similar to the reported for Co porphyrins [54] as follows, equations 6–9

$$[Co(l)TA_3CPP]^- \leftrightarrow [Co(ll)TA_3CPP] + e^-$$
(6)

$$[\text{Co}(\text{II})\text{TA}_3\text{CPP}] + \text{N}_2\text{H}_4 + \text{OH}^-$$

$$\rightarrow [\text{Co(l)TA}_3\text{CPP} \dots \text{N}_2\text{H}_3]^- + \text{H}_2\text{O}$$
 (7)

$$[Co(1)TA_3CPP...N_2H_3]^- \rightarrow [Co(1)TA_3CPP]^- + N_2H_3$$
 (8)

$$N_2H_3 + 3OH^- \rightarrow N_2 + 3e^- + 3H_2O$$

Eqn. 8. Is the rate determining step. Co(ll)TA<sub>3</sub>CPP can be regenerated from Co(1)TA<sub>3</sub>CPP, allowing the repetition of the mechanism process [54].

In order to confirm the mechanism, the oxidation state of metal center in the porphyrin before and after electrocatalysis was determined using XPS (using CoTA<sub>3</sub>CPP-GQDs as an example). Figure 9a) shows the Co 2p XPS spectrum of CoTA<sub>3</sub>CPP-GQDs before and after electrocatalysis. Before electrocatalysis, two peaks at binding energies of 795.01 eV and 779.14 eV corresponding to Co  $2p_{1/2}$  and Co  $2p_{3/2}$  along with the characteristic satellite

peaks at 800.30 eV and 783.30 eV, respectively, were observed. Co(II) is known to show satellite peaks due to the shake up processes [55,56]. The 16 eV splitting between Co  $2p_{1/2}$  and Co  $2p_{3/2}$  is typical of Co(II) [56]. However, after electrocatalysis an increase in binding energy of 2p<sub>1/2</sub> (796.66 eV) and Co 2p<sub>3/2</sub> (781.19 eV) was observed confirming the change in oxidation state of cobalt. No satellite peaks were observed after electrocatalysis which is also likely associated with the change in oxidation state [56]. This is in agreement with the proposed mechanism which shows the reduction of Co(II)

porphyrin to Co(I) by hydrazine undergoing oxidation. Figure 9b) shows a wide scan of  $CoTA_3CPP$ –GQDs before and after electrocatalysis. The spectra indicate that the sample is composed of C, N, Co, and O before and after electrocatalysis demonstrating the stability of  $CoTA_3CPP$ –GQDs.

#### 3.3.2 Kinetic Studies of Hydrazine Detection

Cyclic voltammetry experiments were performed to determine the influence of the different scan rates (10–100 mVs<sup>-1</sup>) (CoTA<sub>3</sub>CPP–GQDs as an example in Figure 10a) in 1 mM hydrazine concentration. An increase in

the oxidation currents and a shift in peak potential to the more positives potentials was observed which indicates that the reaction is irreversible during oxidation of hydrazine on the modified electrode surface. The effect of scan rates was monitored by the plots of anodic peak current vs. square root of the scan rate Figure 10b. The anodic peak current found is directly proportional to square root of the scan rate indicating a diffusion-controlled reaction. Figure 10c shows a linear plot of Ep vs. log v obtained and was used to determine Tafel slope using Eqn. 10.

$$E_p = \frac{b}{2}\log v + K \tag{10}$$

where Ep is the potential, b is the Tafel slope, v is scan rate, and K is a constant. The Tafel slopes obtained were all higher than the normal Tafel slope range (60–120 mV/decade) Table 3. indicating the complications in the reaction mechanism due to the presence of various reactive species on the electrode surface [57].

Since Tafel slope values were all higher than the normal theoretical value 120 mV/decade. We employed the adsorptive linear sweep voltammetry technique to investigate their degree of adsorption (CoTA<sub>3</sub>CPP–GQDs was used as an example in Figure 11). Figure 11a shows linear sweep voltammetric evolution obtained at different concentrations of hydrazine. The linear sweep voltammetry was analyzed using the Langmuir adsorption isotherm theory [58].

$$\frac{[N_2 H_4]}{I_{cat}} = \frac{1}{\beta I_{max}} + \frac{[N_2 H_4]}{I_{max}} \tag{11}$$

where  $I_{cat}$  is catalytic peak current in Figure 11a for different concentrations at the peak potentials,  $I_{max}$  is maximum current obtained from the slope of  $[N_2H_4]/I_{cat}$  Vs.  $[N_2H_4]$  in Figure 11b and  $\beta$  is the adsorption equilibrium constant which is related to electrochemical Gibbs free energy change  $(\Delta G \theta^{\circ})$  by Eqn. 12 [58].

$$\Delta G^{\circ} = -RT \ln \beta \tag{12}$$

where R is the ideal gas constant, T is the absolute temperature. From the slope and the intercept in Figure 11b, the  $\beta$  value was obtained and then used to estimate the  $\Delta G^{\circ}$  value. The  $\Delta G^{\circ}$  value was found to be  $-16.70~kJ\,\text{mol}^{-1}$ . The negative value indicates that the adsorption of hydrazine on CoTA\_3CPP–GQDs is spontaneous which justifies the larger Tafel slopes [59]. It has been reported that hydrazine readily binds to the metal in N4 macrocyclic compounds [60], suggesting that metal of porphyrin is partially exposed in the presence of GQDs.

#### 3.3.3 Chronoamperometric Studies

Chronoamperometry was used to determine the rate constants and limits of detection (LoD) of the complexes and conjugates. Figure 12a shows chronoamperometric scans of  $CoTA_3CPP$ –GQDs as an example. The plots of  $I_{cat}/I_{buf}$  vs. square root of time within rapid decay region (2 s) were linear with varying slopes Figure 12b. The rate constant was determined using the Eqn. 13.

$$\frac{I_{cat}}{I_{but}} = \gamma^{\frac{1}{2}} \pi^{\frac{1}{2}} = \pi^{\frac{1}{2}} (kCt)^{\frac{1}{2}}$$
(13)

where  $I_{cat}$  and  $I_{buf}$  currents on the modified electrodes in the presence and absence of hydrazine, k is the catalytic rate constant, C is the bulk concentration of hydrazine, and t the time elapsed in seconds. The slopes obtained from the plots in Figure 12b were plotted against concentration of hydrazine Figure 12c. The slope is equal to  $\pi k$  where k is rate constant. The linear relationships of the plots in Figure 12c are represented by equation 14a–e.

#### CoTA<sub>3</sub>CPP

$$y = 826.17 [N_2H_4] (\frac{s^{-1}}{mM}) + 344.34 s^{-1}, R^2 = 0.9681 (14a)$$

#### CoTA<sub>3</sub>CPP-GQDs

$$y = 2006.6 [N_2H_4] (\frac{s^{-1}}{mM}) + 740.65 s^{-1}, R^2 = 0.9509 (14b)$$

#### ClMnTA<sub>3</sub>CPP

$$y = 153.77 [N_2H_4] (\frac{s^{-1}}{mM}) + 45.661 s^{-1}, R^2 = 0.9497 (14c)$$

## CIMnTA<sub>3</sub>CPP-GQDs

$$y = 257.08 [N_2H_4] (\frac{s^{-1}}{mM}) + 18.563 s^{-1}, R^2 = 0.9382$$
 (14d)

#### **GODs**

y = 37.145 [N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>] 
$$(\frac{s^{-1}}{mM})$$
 + 3.6941 s<sup>-1</sup>, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.9605 (14e)

The catalytic rate constants obtained are presented in Table 3. CoTA<sub>3</sub>CPP–GQDs showed the highest catalytic rate constant followed by CoTA<sub>3</sub>CPP. This suggest that Co produces high catalytic rate constant, in addition the introduction of GQDs improved the catalytic rate constant as expected [15]. The ClMnTA<sub>3</sub>CPP–GQDs showed higher catalytic rate constant than ClMnTA<sub>3</sub>CPP but still lower when compared to CoTA<sub>3</sub>CPP alone.

The limits of detection (LoD) were calculated using Eqn. 15.

$$LoD = \frac{3\sigma}{slope} \tag{15}$$

where  $\sigma$  represents the standard deviation, the slope was obtained from the calibration curve, Figure 12a (insert). The CoTA<sub>3</sub>CPP-GQDs showed the lowest LoD, Table 3. GQDs also improved the LoD after combining with ClMnTA<sub>3</sub>CPP and CoTA<sub>3</sub>CPP. In terms of metal porphyrins alone, CoTA<sub>3</sub>CPP showed better LoD than ClMnTA<sub>3</sub>CPP, this is due to the higher anodic peak currents for the former, Table 2.

#### 4 Conclusions

The synthesis of CoTA<sub>3</sub>CPP and ClMnTA<sub>3</sub>CPP and their combination with GQDs was successful. CoTA<sub>3</sub>CPP showed good electronic properties and showed good catalytic activity. The presence of both NH<sub>2</sub> and COOH groups improved the oxidation peak potential. When compared to ClMnTA<sub>3</sub>CPP, CoTA<sub>3</sub>CPP showed better catalytic properties in terms of catalytic rate constants and LoD. However ClMnTA<sub>3</sub>CPP showed better oxidation peak potential compared to CoTA<sub>3</sub>CPP. The introduction of GQDs improved the catalytic ability of both ClMnTA<sub>3</sub>CPP and CoTA<sub>3</sub>CPP.

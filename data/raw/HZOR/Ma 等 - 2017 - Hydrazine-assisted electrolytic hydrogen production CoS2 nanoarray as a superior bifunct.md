The sluggish kinetics of oxygen evolution reaction has severely hindered the energetic convenience of electrolytic water splitting. In this communication, we demonstrate that CoS<sub>2</sub> nanoarray on Ti mesh (CoS<sub>2</sub>/TiM) behaves as an efficient and durable catalyst for hydrazine oxidation reaction in 1.0 M KOH with 100 mM hydrazine, with the need of potential 125 mV to achieve 100 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. The high hydrogen-evolving activity for CoS<sub>2</sub>/TiM makes it a bifunctional catalyst for energy-saving electrolytic hydrogen generation by replacing water oxidation with hydrazine oxidation. To drive 100 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, its two-electrode electrolyzer demands a low cell voltage of only 0.81 V, with remarkable long-term electrochemical durability and nearly 100% Faradic efficiency for hydrogen evolution.

The exploitation of hydrogen, a clean, reliable and sustainable energy carrier, has been widely advocated to meet the increasing threat of global climate change and energy crisis.<sup>1,2</sup> Among the different ways for hydrogen production, electrochemical water splitting has drawn increasing attention due to the clean and highly efficient energy conversion to produce hydrogen.<sup>3-6</sup> However, as a half reaction, the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) significantly hinders the overall efficiency of water splitting for its high activation energy barrier for O-O bond formation. 7-9 Encouragingly, such issue can be solved by replacing electrooxidation of water at anode with oxidation of more readily oxidizable species, such as alcohols, urea, and ammonia, 4,10-15 but all these works suffer from the involvement of noble metal catalysts or limited catalytic currents. On the other hand, using bifunctional catalysts for such anodic reaction and cathodic hydrogen

The standard potential for hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) is -0.38 V which is much lower than that of OER (+1.23 V). 16 In addition, HzOR only releases nitrogen and water, without generation of catalyst-poisoning species. 17-19 Since hydrazine is widely used in industry, 20 it is considerable by replaceing OER to HzOR for more energy-efficient electrolytic hydrogen production. Efficient electrocatalysts are required to lower the reaction potential. Co has emerged as an interesting transition metal with catalytic power toward HzOR and Cobased catalyst materials have been reported, including Co complex<sup>21,22</sup> and metallic Co.<sup>23,24</sup> CoS<sub>2</sub> possesses remarkable electrical conductivity,<sup>25</sup> which is of great benefit for enhanced electrochemical performances. Indeed, considerable recent research has focused on its utilization as electrode material for lithium ion battery<sup>25,26</sup> and supercapacitor<sup>27</sup> as well as catalyst mateial for sensitized solar cell, 28,29 oxygen reduction reaction<sup>30</sup> and HER.<sup>31,32</sup> To the best of our knowledge, however, no attention has been paid on its use for HzOR electrocatalysis and as a bifunctional catalyst for less energyintensive electrochemical hydrogen production.

In this letter, we describe our recent effort in developing  $CoS_2$  nanoarray on Ti mesh  $(CoS_2/TiM)$  as a durable non-noblemetal catalyst for HzOR with the need of potential of 125 mV to achieve 100 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> in 1.0 M KOH with 100 mM hydrazine. The high HER activity for  $CoS_2/TiM$  makes it an attractive bifunctional catalyst for hydrogen generation by replacing OER with HzOR. The corresponding two-electrode electrolyzer employing  $CoS_2/TiM$  for simultaneous  $H_2$  and  $N_2$  production only requires a cell voltage of 0.81 V to drive 100 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, 1.07 V less compared to pure water splitting, with remarkable long-term electrochemical durability with nearly 100% Faradic efficiency (FE) for hydrogen evolution.

evolution reaction (HER) have additional advantages of simplying the sytem and lowering the fabrication cost. As such, it is highly attractive but still remains a key challenge to develop energy-saving electrolytic hydrogen production systems based on earth-abundant bifunctional catalysts efficient for both reactions.

CoS<sub>2</sub> nanoarray was developed on TiM via topotactic precursor<sup>33</sup> conversion from its Co(OH)F on (Co(OH)F/TiM). After hydrothermal reaction, the color of the TiM substrate changed from dark grey to pink and turned to black after sulfidation (Fig. S1). Fig. 1a shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of substrate, precursor and catalyst. The hydrothermal product exhibits peaks corresponding to Co(OH)F (JCPDS 50-0827) and Ti mesh (JCPDS 44-1294), consist with previous reports.<sup>33</sup> And after sulfidation process, it shows diffraction peaks at 32.5°, 36.5°, 38.6°, 46.6° and 55.2° indexed to the (200), (210), (211), (220) and (311) planes of CoS<sub>2</sub>, respectively (JCPDS No. 41-1471), other peaks originate from the Ti substrate. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis indicates that TiM (Fig. 1b) was completely covered with Co(OH)F nanowires array (Fig. 1c and 1d) after hydrothermal treatment. After sulfidation, the product still maintains its integrated feature and morphology but with rougher surface (Fig. 1e). As shown in Fig. 1f, the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of one single CoS<sub>2</sub> nanowire suggests that it is about 60 nm in diameter. The highresolution TEM (HRTEM) image taken from the CoS<sub>2</sub> nanowire reveals well-resolved lattice fringes with an interplanar distance of 0.226 nm corresponding to the (211) plane of CoS<sub>2</sub> phase (inset of Fig. 1f). Fig. 1g presents the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) image, several bright rings are made up of discrete spots, which can be indexed to the planes of CoS<sub>2</sub> perfectly. Fig. 1h shows the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectrum in the Co 2p region. The peaks at binding energies (BEs) of 800.0 and 783.5 eV are assigned to Co 2p<sub>1/2</sub> and Co 2p<sub>3/2</sub> respectively, accompanying with two satellite peaks (identified as "Sat.") at 803.0 and 787.0 eV. 34 As for S region (Fig. 1i), the peaks at 164.2 and 163.1 eV reflect the BEs of S  $2p_{1/2}$  and S  $2p_{3/2}$ , respectively, which are typical to metal-sulphur bonds. 35,36 And the peak at 169.7 eV can be assigned to S-O species arising from surface oxidation.<sup>37</sup>

(f) Chronopotentiometric curve of CoS<sub>2</sub>/TiM with constant current density of 50 mA cm<sup>2</sup>. All experiments were carried out in 1.0 M KOH.

We studied the HzOR activity of CoS<sub>2</sub>/TiM using a typical three-electrode setup with a scan rate of 5 mV s<sup>-1</sup> in alkaline media. The ohmic potential drop losses from the solution resistance were applied to all initial data<sup>38</sup> and all potentials were reported on a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale unless specifically stated. Fig. 2a shows the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves of CoS2/TiM toward different concentrations of hydrazine. As observed, there is no anodic current response within the investigated potential window in 1.0 M KOH. In sharp contrast, the addition of 20 mM hydrazine leads to sharp rise in anodic current and an increase in hydrazine concentration gives higher current density. These observations suggest that CoS2/TiM is an efficient catalyst electrode for HzOR. Fig. 2b compares the HzOR performances of CoS<sub>2</sub>/TiM, Co(OH)F/TiM, bare TiM and platinum foil (Pt), suggesting that TiM is not active for HzOR and Co(OH)F/TiM has poor HzOR activity. Remarkably, CoS<sub>2</sub>/TiM electrode is highly active for HzOR and only demands a low potential of 125 mV to drive 100 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, which is even lower than that of Pt  $(\eta_{100 \text{ mA cm}}^{-2} = 229 \text{ mV})$  and other catalysts (Table S1), implying CoS<sub>2</sub>/TiM is superior for electrochemical HzOR catalysis. The HzOR kinetics was also studied by comparing their Tafel plots (Fig. 2c). Tafel slope of 48 mV dec<sup>-1</sup> for CoS<sub>2</sub>/TiM is much lower than that of Pt (63 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>), suggesting its more favorable catalytic kinetics for HzOR. Fig. 2d shows the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data, revealing CoS2/TiM has a lower charge-transfer resistance (R<sub>ct</sub>) and thus a higher reaction rate and more rapid catalytic kinetics than Co(OH)F/TiM.39 Moreover, the lower

series resistance ( $R_s$ ) indicates  $CoS_2/TiM$  (4.43 $\Omega$ ) has better electrical conductivity than Co(OH)F/TiM (14.05Ω).<sup>32</sup> Fig. 2e presents the LSV curves for CoS<sub>2</sub>/TiM at different scan rates. This CoS<sub>2</sub>/TiM electrode only shows slight changes with the increase of scan rates from 5 to 50 mV s<sup>-1</sup>, also suggesting efficient charge and mass transport for the HzOR catalytic processe. 9,13 A 10 h long-term electrolysis at a constant current density of 50 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> further manifests the superior durability of CoS<sub>2</sub>/TiM towards HzOR (Fig. 2f). XRD analysis indicates that this catalyst is still CoS<sub>2</sub> in nature (Fig. S2). These results reveal the prominent durability and stability of CoS<sub>2</sub>/TiM electrode.

We further evaluated the HzOR and OER performances for CoS<sub>2</sub>/TiM electrode. As shown in Fig. 3a, this electrode demands 1.67 V to 150 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> for OER electrocatalysis, 1.5 V more than that needed for HzOR, suggesting HzOR is much more energy-efficient than OER. To successfully couple HER and HzOR for energy-efficient H<sub>2</sub> production, the CoS<sub>2</sub>/TiM electrode should maintain excellent HER performance in the presence of hydrazine. In Fig. 3b, the HER LSV curves of CoS<sub>2</sub>/TiM in 1.0 M KOH before and after the addition of 100 mM hydrazine overlay almost exactly with each other, implying the presence of 100 mM hydrazine has negligible influence on HER performance of CoS2/TiM. It needs overpotential of 178 mV to drive 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, comparing favorably to the behaviors of other HER catalyst like cattieritetype  $CoS_2$  ( $\eta_{10~mA~cm}^{-2}$  = ~244 mV) $^{40}$  and  $CoS_2$  nanopyramid ( $\eta_{10}$  $_{\text{mA cm}}^{-2}$  = ~250). <sup>41</sup> A detailed comparison is shown in Table S2. The time-dependent current density curve under a static overpotential of 270 mV (Fig. 3c) suggests that CoS<sub>2</sub>/TiM maintains its HER catalytic activity for at least 20 h. And the accompany XRD pattern of the catalyst after HER also consist with the pristine catalyst shown in Fig. S2. Also shows robust of CoS<sub>2</sub> nanoarray.

**Fig. 3.** (a) LSV curves of CoS<sub>2</sub>/TiM at a scan rate of 5 mV s<sup>-1</sup> for HzOR (1.0 M KOH with 100 mM hydrazine) and OER (1.0 M KOH). (b) LSV curves of CoS<sub>2</sub>/TiM for HER at a scan rate of 5 mV s<sup>-1</sup> in 1.0 M KOH with and without 100 mM hydrazine. (c) Time-dependent current density curve of CoS<sub>2</sub>/TiM for HER under static overpotential of 270 mV for 20 h.

Above results show the potential of using CoS<sub>2</sub>/TiM as an efficient and durable bifunctional catalyst for HzOR and HER toward energy-saving electrolytic hydrogen production. To this end, we made a two-electrode electrolyzer using CoS<sub>2</sub>/TiM as both cathode for HER and anode for HzOR. As shown in Fig. 4a

and 4b, CoS<sub>2</sub>/TiM CoS<sub>2</sub>/TiM couple needs cell voltages of 0.49, 0.63 and 0.81 V to achieve 20, 50 and 100 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, respectively, in 1.0 m KOH with 100 mM hydrazine. To drive the corresponding current densities, however, required much larger voltages of 1.55, 1.73 and 1.89 without the presence of hydrazine. This observation demonstrates that replacing OER with HzOR in anode offers a quite effective way to lower the potential needed and attain higher current density. Fig. 4c shows the chronopotentiometric curve for CoS<sub>2</sub>/TiM CoS<sub>2</sub>/TiM couple. As observed, a cell voltage of 0.52 V is required to maintain 25 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> for 20000 s. At a cell voltage of 0.8 V, vigorous gas evolution occurs on both electrodes (Movie S1). The amount of generated H<sub>2</sub> was further measured quantitatively using a calibrated pressure sensor to monitor the pressure change in the cathode compartments of an Htype electrolytic cell.<sup>33</sup> As shown in Fig. 4d, the generated H<sub>2</sub> roughly matches the calculated result based on passed charge suggesting a nearly 100% FE.

(b) Comparison of the voltages to achieve current densities of 20, 50 and 100 mA cm<sup>-1</sup> in electrolyte with and without 100 mM hydrazine. (c) Chronopotentiometric curve for CoS<sub>2</sub>/TiM || CoS<sub>2</sub>/TiM couple with constant current density of 25 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. (d) The amount of hydrogen theoretically calculated and experimentally measured vs. time for CoS<sub>2</sub>/TiM || CoS<sub>2</sub>/TiM electrolyzer. All experiments were carried out in 1.0 M KOH.

In summary, CoS<sub>2</sub> nanoarray has been proven as an efficient and stable non-noble-metal catalyst for HzOR in alkaline media. Its high HER activity enables it as a bifunctional catalyst for energy-saving electrolytic hydrogen generation by replacing OER with HzOR and the corresponding two-electrode system only needs a cell voltage of 0.81 V to drive 100 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> with strong long-term electrochemical durability and nearly 100% FE for hydrogen evolution. The superior catalytic activity and stability for this CoS<sub>2</sub> nanoarray, along with its scalable and low-cost fabrication process, promise its future usage as an attractive earth-abundant 3D catalyst electrode toward economical and large-scale hydrazine-assisted hydrogen generation for applications. 39,42-44

 $CoS_2$  nanoarray on Ti mesh acts as an efficient and durable catalyst for hydrazine oxidation reaction and it only needs 0.81 V to attain 100 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> in 1.0 M KOH with 100mM hydrazine for its two-electrode electrolyser.

**Abstract:** Electrochemical water splitting for H<sup>2</sup> production is limited by the sluggish anode oxygen evolution reaction (OER), thus using hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) to replace OER has received great attention. Here we report the hierarchical porous nanosheet arrays with abundant Ni3N-Co3N heterointerfaces on Ni foam with superior hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and HzOR activity, realizing working potentials of -43 and -88 mV for 10 mA cm-2 , respectively, and achieving an industry-level 1000 mA cm-2 at 200 mV for HzOR. The two-electrode overall hydrazine splitting (OHzS) electrolyzer requires the cell voltages of 0.071 and 0.76 V for 10 and 400 mA cm-2 , respectively. The H<sup>2</sup> production powered by direct hydrazine fuel cell (DHzFC) and a commercial solar cell are investigated to inspire future practical applications. DFT calculations decipher that heterointerfaces simultaneously optimize the hydrogen adsorption free energy (∆GH\*) and promote the hydrazine dehydrogenation kinetics. This work provides a rationale for advanced bifunctional electrocatalysts, and propels the practical energy-saving H<sup>2</sup> generation techniques.

#### **Introduction**

The growing concerns for the energy crisis and environmental issues due to the fossil fuel utilization have triggered more research attention on the clean and renewable energy resources.[1] Owing to the high gravimetric energy density and environmental friendliness nature, hydrogen (H2) is regarded as the most significant alternative energy carrier to the conventional fossil fuels.[2] Compared with the industrial-scale hydrogen production through steam reforming, water electrolysis

has been considered as one of the most promising methods to generate high purity H<sup>2</sup> in the future.[3] Nevertheless, the overall energy conversion efficiency of water splitting is largely suppressed by the sluggish kinetics of the electrode reactions, especially the high theoretical potential of anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER, 4OH<sup>−</sup> → O<sup>2</sup> + 2H2O + 4e<sup>−</sup> , 1.23 V *vs*. RHE). [4] Despite advanced bifunctional electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and OER have been extensively reported, the input cell voltage of overall water splitting (OWS) in practical electrolyzers still requires 1.6 to 2.0 V.[5] Recently, hydrazine-assisted H<sup>2</sup> production via replacing OER with thermodynamically favorable hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR, N2H<sup>4</sup> + 4OH- → N<sup>2</sup> + 4H2O + 4e- , -0.33 V *vs*. RHE), has been proposed as an alternative energy-saving approach with bright prospect.[6] Besides the much lower cell voltage in overall hydrazine splitting (OHzS), the membrane-free electrolyzer could be adaptable in future practical applications since the only by-product at the anode is the inert nitrogen (N2) instead of the explosive H2/O<sup>2</sup> mixture in the OWS system.[7] Unfortunately, most efforts have been focused on the design of advanced and low-cost electrocatalysts for HER, while the development of electro-active non-noble metal materials for HzOR has been far behind, let alone the bifunctional electrocatalysts for both HER and HzOR.

Recently, some pioneering works have demonstrated that constructing heterostructure interfaces could be an effective strategy to realize the simultaneous modulations of the electronic structure and active sites of catalysts.[8] These features can not only preserve the intrinsic catalytic activities of the each component, but also endow the novel or enhanced electrochemical performances attributed to the interfacial synergy effect, which have been demonstrated in the development of advanced electrocatalysts for hydrogen and oxygen catalysis.[9] For example, Sun and co-workers reported that the Ni3N/Ni heterostructures exhibited exceptional HER/HOR activities in aqueous electrolytes since the existence of Ni3N/Ni interfaces can facilitate both the original adsorption and the subsequent dissociation of water on the catalyst surface. [9b] In a most recent study, Hu's group successfully synthesized NiSe2/CoSe2-T heterostructure nanohybrid with the optimized binding energy of oxygenated species and accelerated the reaction kinetics, which exhibits outstanding performance for reversible oxygen electrocatalysis (OER/ORR).[9c] On the other hand, transition metal nitrides (TMNs) have recently gained extraordinary attention as electrocatalysts due to their unique features of low cost, promising activty and physicochemical stability. For instance, Chou *et al.* synthesized a hierarchical Ni-Fe-Mo trimental nitride nanotubes (NTs) with excellent catalytic activity toward both the HER and OER, and can drive 10 mA cm-2 at a cell voltage of 1.513 V.[10] Inspiringly, this class of material also exhibits great potential for hydrazine oxidation electrolysis according to the recent literatures including PW-Co3N,[7a] Cu1Ni2-N[11] and Ni3N/Ni,[12] thus it is expected to explore a new bifunctional TMNs-based heterostructure catalyst to boost the efficiency of both HER and HzOR, which has rarely been achieved. Moreover, to decipher the underlying mechanism of heterointerfaces towards HER and HzOR catalytic activity is of great significance for the design of high-efficient bifunctional catalysts towards hydrazine-assisted H<sup>2</sup> production, which is yet underdeveloped.

Herein, we present the in-situ growth of hierarchical porous nanosheet arrays with abundant Ni3N-Co3N heterointerfaces on Ni foam (denoted as Ni3N-Co3N PNAs/NF), which can exhibit superior bifunctionality towards both hydrogen evolution and hydrazine oxidation catalysis in alkaline electrolyte. Outstandingly, it can achieve a current density of 10 mA cm-2 at a low overpotential (η) of 43 mV with a small Tafel slope of 35.1 mV dec-1 for HER in 1.0 M KOH. Meanwhile, for HzOR, it only requires an ultralow working potential of -88 mV (*vs*. RHE) to reach 10 mA cm-2 in 1 M KOH/0.1 M N2H<sup>4</sup> electrolyte, and more impressively, can reach an ultrahigh current density of 1000 mA cm-2 at a small working potential of 200 mV (*vs*. RHE). Furthermore, in the two-electrode electrolyzer for OHzS utilizing the Ni3N-Co3N PNAs/NF electrodes as bifunctional electrocatalysts, the record-low cell voltages of 0.071 and 0.76 V can drive 10 and 400 mA cm-2 , respectively, which suggests the great potential for energy-saving H<sup>2</sup> production compared to OWS system. Inspired by the superior performance, a proof-ofconcept self-powered H<sup>2</sup> production system is integrated by using a home-made direct hydrazine fuel cell (DHzFC) with the Ni3N-Co3N PNAs/NF anode as the power sources to drive OHzS system, where a decent H<sup>2</sup> evolution rate of 0.65 mmol h−1 can be achieved in alkaline electrolyte with a relatively low hydrazine concentration (0.5 M for DHzFC and 0.1 M for OHzS). Additionally, when powered by a commercial solar cell with an open circuit voltage of 1.0 V, this hybrid water electrolyzer presents a splendid OHzS performance enabling a current density of 214 mA cm-2 . The density function theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the interfacial electron transfer between Ni3N and Co3N heterointerfaces could simultaneously result in a more thermo-neutral hydrogen adsorption free energy (∆GH\*) and promote the hydrazine dehydrogenation kinetics compared with pure Ni3N or Co3N counterpart. Our work demonstrates the possibility to develop practicable electrocatalysts based on transition metal nitrides with delicate nanostructure engineering, and more importantly, stimulates the advancement of energysaving H<sup>2</sup> production for future applications.

#### **Results and Discussion**

The hierarchical Ni3N-Co3N PNAs/NF electrode is synthesized by a facile two-step process, as schematically illustrated in Figure 1a. Firstly, the Ni-Co precursor nanosheet arrays were directly grown on the Ni foam (denoted as NiCo-Pre NAs/NF) through a simple hydrothermal process according to previous literature with minor modifications.[13] The final product of Ni3N-Co3N PNAs/NF can be spontaneously formed upon the controllable thermal treatment under the NH<sup>3</sup> atmosphere (see

the Experimental Section for details). The morphological characterizations of the NiCo-Pre NAs/NF were firstly performed by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As can be seen, the Ni-Co precursor nanosheets uniformly grown on Ni foam exhibit smooth surfaces (Figure S1). After annealing treatment at 450 <sup>o</sup>C for 2 h under the NH<sup>3</sup> atmosphere, the dense and uniform nanosheets morphology of precursor can be well retained (Figure 1b, c), while the nanosheet exhibits the porous structure composed of interconnected nanoparticles (Figure 1d). The porosity of the hierarchical porous Ni3N-Co3N nanosheets were characterized by N<sup>2</sup> sorption analysis, from which the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) specific surface area of Ni3N-Co3N nanosheets was determined to be 10.93 m<sup>2</sup> g -1 and the average pore diameter was approximately 20 nm (Figure S2). The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the as-prepared samples scraped from Ni foam substrate (Figure 1e) shows that the Ni-Co precursor contains the mixed phases of Ni(OH)<sup>2</sup> (JCPDS No. 38-0715) and Co(OH)<sup>2</sup> (JCPDS No. 02-0925), which would ensure the valid transformation of mixed hybrid hydroxides to nitride heterostructures upon annealing treatment. Obviously, the new diffraction peaks after nitridation can be easily indexed to the Ni3N phase (JCPDS No. 10-0280) and Co3N phase (JCPDS No. 06-0691), respectively. In addition, Raman spectra provide further evidence of the nitride formation (Figure 1f), where typical vibration modes of the nickel/cobalt nitride phases appear at 474, 520, and 663 cm-1 , [14] accompanying with the disappearance of three Raman peaks at 461, 498, and 524 cm-1 related to the vibrations of Co-O/Ni-O bonds in the precursor.[15] The high-angle annular dark-field scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mapping results (Figure 1g) display the homogeneous distribution of Ni, Co, and N elements throughout the whole nanosheet, suggesting the successful fabrication of metal nitrides. The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) analyses (Figure 1h, i) reveal that the heterointerface structure exsits on the porous nanosheets, and the interfaces between Ni3N and Co3N marked with red dotted line can be clearly observed. In the enlarged HRTEM region, the nanoparticle displays two different domains of Ni3N and Co3N, in which the lattice fringe spacings of 2.20 and 2.07 Å correspond to the (002) and (101) planes of Co3N, and the interplanar spacings of 2.13 and 2.03 Å can be indexed to (002) and (111) planes of Ni3N, in agreement with the XRD results. By carefully matching the lattice fringes of both sides of the interface, an interface between the (002) planes of Ni3N and Co3N can be observed (Figure 1j). Importantly, this Ni3N-Co3N heterointerface structure can be universally detected in the nanosheets (Figure S3), which further confirms the formation of the Ni-Co-based nitride heterostructure. The pure Ni3N and Co3N porous nanosheet arrays on the Ni foam (denoted as Ni3N PNAs/NF and Co3N PNAs/NF) were also successfully prepared by the similar method for comparison (Figure S4). Meanwhile, the Raman spectrum (Figure S5) of Ni3N-Co3N PNAs/NF also shows typical characteristic peaks of the single counterparts, further suggesting the presence of the Ni3N and Co3N phases. To obtain the optimized nitride heterostructures, the annealing temperatures are varied from 350 to 500 <sup>o</sup>C (Figure S6). It is noted that the Ni3N and Co3N

phases can steadily exist only when the temperature is lower

than 500 °C, which may due to the low thermal stability of nitrides at high temperature.[9b]

The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were conducted to gain insights into the surface chemical states and electronic interactions. The comparing XPS survey spectra (Figure 2a) can clearly identify the coexistence of Ni, Co, and N elements in Ni3N-Co3N PNAs/NF. The highresolution Ni 2p spectra of Ni3N-Co3N PNAs/NF (Figure 2b) contain three different types of nickel species, indicating the multiple chemical states of Ni. Specifically, the deconvoluted peaks at 852.1 and 869.4 eV can be assigned to the Ni 2p3/2 and Ni 2p1/2 of the metallic Ni,[16] while the peaks centered at 854.9 and 872.4 eV are attributed to the Ni-N bonds. [17] The presence of metallic state of nickel could originate from the partial reducing effect during the thermal treatment with NH3, implying the possibility of superior electrical conductivity. Meanwhile, the other two peaks at 855.4 and 873.3 eV can be assigned to Ni-O bonds,[11] which is likely due to the adventitious surface oxidation when exposed to air before measurement. Similarly, the highresolution of Co 2p spectra (Figure 2c) could also be deconvoluted into three kinds of peaks corresponding to the metallic cobalt (778.0 and 794.3 eV),[18] Co-N (780.2 and 795.9 eV),[18-19] and Co-O (781.9 and 797.3 eV),[5b, 7a] respectively. The N 1s XPS spectra of Ni3N-Co3N PNAs/NF (Figure 2d) show three peaks at 397.3, 399.3, and 402.6 eV, which are ascribed to metal-N, N-H, and N-O, further confirming the formation of nitride.[7a, 17, 20] It should be noted that the Ni-N peak in Ni3N-Co3N PNAs/NF exhibits a negative shift compared to that in Ni3N PNAs/NF, while the Co-N bonds positively shift relative to that in Co3N PNAs/NF, demonstrating the partial reduction of Ni and partial oxidation of Co in the Ni3N-Co3N heterostructures compared with the corresponding single component. Such interfacial electronic interaction could further promote electrochemical performances, in which the higher charge density of Ni species could optimize of the H2O and H\* absorption energies, thus improve the catalytic activity towards

HER activity,[8a] whereas the electron-deficient region on Co sites would favour the adsorption of N2H<sup>4</sup> molecule,[21] endowing the possible bifunctionality. Besides, in comparison with N 1s spectra of Ni3N and Co3N, the binding energy of metal-N in Ni3N/Co3N has an evident negative shift, which indicates the electron redistribution in the heterostructures. These analysis reveals that the electronic interaction between Ni3N and Co3N owing to the establishment of coupling interfaces in Ni3N-Co3N PNAs/NF. The surface wettability of electrode could have a significant influence on electrocatalytic performance, and Ni3N-Co3N PNAs/NF exhibits a superhydrophilic property with nearly 0 o for water contact angle (Figure S7 and Movie S1), indicating the favourable contact between electrode surface and electrolyte.

The electrocatalytic activity for HER of the as-synthesized samples were investigated in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte with a typical three-electrode system. Before the measurements, all the reference electrode potentials were calibrated with respect to reversible hydrogen electrode (Figure S8). The effect of nitridation temperature and duration toward HER performance were firstly studied (Figure S9), where the NiCo-Pre NAs/NF annealed at 450 °C for 2h shows the best catalytic activity (denoted as Ni3N-Co3N PNAs/NF throughout the text). Figure 3a compares the linear sweep voltammograms (LSV) curves of Ni3N-Co3N PNAs/NF, Ni3N PNAs/NF, Co3N PNAs/NF, bare Ni foam, and commercial 20 wt.% Pt/C, among which the Ni3N-Co3N PNAs/NF possesses an exceptional electrocatalytic activity for HER (Figure 3b), exhibiting an ultrasmall overpotential of 43 mV to achieve 10 mA cm-2 , which is slightly higher than the benchmark Pt/C (31 mV), but much lower than Ni3N PNAs/NF (88 mV), Co3N PNAs/NF (104 mV) and bare Ni foam (252 mV). Inspiringly, the activity of Ni3N-Co3N PNAs/NF even surpasses the commercial Pt/C when current density beyond the 150 mA cm-2 , which is also better than the most reported non-noble metal based catalysts (Table S1). The corresponding Tafel slope (Figure 3c**)** was calculated to be 35.1 mV dec-1 , which is close to that of benchmark Pt/C (30.0 mV dec-1 ), and much smaller than Ni3N PNAs/NF (70.5 mV dec-1 ), Co3N PNAs/NF (73.0 mV dec-1 ), and Ni foam (148.6 mV dec-1 ), suggesting the favorable reaction kinetics of Ni3N-Co3N PNAs/NF. Moreover, to further understand the splendid activity, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) were also investigated (Figure 3d and Figure S10, S11), among which the Ni3N-Co3N PNAs/NF electrode possesses a lower charge transfer resistance (Rct) and larger ECSA, consistent with its superior HER performance. According to the LSV curves normalized by the ECSA, the Ni3N-Co3N PNAs/NF electrode still shows the highest catalytic performance (Figure S12). To further assess the intrinsic specific activities of Ni3N-Co3N PNAs/NF, the exchange current density (j0) and turnover frequency (TOF) were also investigated (Figure S13-15). The calculated j<sup>0</sup> of Ni3N-Co3N PNAs/NF was 1.03 mA cm-2 , which was 1.14, 2.51, and 1.24 times than that of Ni3N PNAs/NF, Co3N PNAs/NF, and Pt/C, respectively. Meantime, when η was 150 mV, the Ni3N-Co3N PNAs/NF possesses the largest TOF value of 1.06 s-1 . These results imply that the Ni3N-Co3N heterostructure can remarkably enhance the intrinsic activity, thus endows superior HER activity of the Ni3N-Co3N PNAs/NF. Long-term stability is also very important for the practical applications of the electrocatalyst, which is evaluated through different techniques. Firstly, it can be observed that the LSV curves and Nyquist plots of Ni3N-Co3N PNAs/NF after 5000 and 10000 cycles remain nearly unchanged compared with the initial one (Figure 3e and Figure S16), demonstrating the remarkable stability. In addition, the chronoamperometry test at the overpotential of 105 mV was conducted, where the current density could be maintained at 25 mA cm-2 for 40 h without obvious decay (Figure 3f). Meanwhile, the post-HER characterizations (Figure S17, S18) prove that the hierarchical porous feature of the Ni3N-Co3N heterostructure nanosheets can be well retained after HER test, revealing a

robust durability of Ni3N-Co3N PNAs/NF electrode during HER process.

The electrochemical performance of Ni3N-Co3N PNAs/NF electrode for HzOR were then evaluated via three-electrode system in KOH/N2H<sup>4</sup> electrolyte. The Ni3N-Co3N PNAs/NF electrode annealed at 450 °C for 2 h also displays the best catalytic activity toward HzOR (Figure S19). Intuitively, the catalytic activity toward HzOR can be reflected by the comparing LSV curves under different concentrations of N2H<sup>4</sup> in 1.0 M KOH (Figure S20). Notably, there is no obvious anodic response current in the potential window without the addition of N2H4, while it will sharply rise along with the increase of hydrazine concentrations, implying the outstanding HzOR catalytic activity. Figure 4a further compares the electrocatalytic HzOR performances for Ni3N-Co3N PNAs/NF, Ni3N PNAs/NF, Co3N PNAs/NF, bare Ni foam, and commercial Pt/C (20 wt.%) in 1.0 M KOH/0.1 M N2H<sup>4</sup> electrolyte, in which the Ni3N-Co3N PNAs/NF exhibits excellent catalytic property. The working potentials at current density of 10 and 1000 mA cm-2 for Ni3N-Co3N PNAs/NF are merely -88 and 200 mV (*vs*. RHE), which are much lower than that of other catalysts especially at high current densities, suggesting the significantly improved HzOR activity by constructing heterointerfaces. The corresponding Tafel slope (Figure 4b) of Ni3N-Co3N PNAs/NF is 21.6 mV dec-1 , much lower than Ni3N PNAs/NF (35.9 mV dec-1 ), Co3N PNAs/NF (37.5 mV dec-1 ), bare Ni foam (178.9 mV dec-1 ), and Pt/C (43.3 mV dec-1 ), which indicates its faster HzOR kinetics. The remarkable HzOR activity of Ni3N-Co3N PNAs/NF also exceeds most of the recently reported nonprecious metal-based catalysts (Table S2). Moreover, the Ni3N-Co3N PNAs/NF shows the smallest Rct among all the prepared catalysts (Figure 4c), which can be attributed to the fast interfacial electron transfer kinetics of the heterointerface structure. Noticeably, the analysis on the j<sup>0</sup> values and respective ECSA normalized LSV curves indicates that the Ni3N-Co3N PNAs/NF still delivers superior specific activity than other catalysts for HzOR (Figure S21, S22). As shown in Figure S23, there is negligible current change when the scan rates are varied from 10 to 100 mV s-1 , indicating the efficient charge and mass transport during HzOR catalytic process.[6] Excitingly, the comparison of LSV curves for HzOR and OER of the Ni3N-Co3N PNAs/NF electrode demonstrates the great kinetic advantages of HzOR electrolysis (Figure 4d). It only requires the working potentials of -9, 28.6, 54.8, 76.8, 98.6, and 118.5 mV (*vs*. RHE) for HzOR to reach the current densities of 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, and 600 mA cm-2 , respectively, whereas OER needs much higher values of 1613, 1698, 1774, 1847, 1917, and 1986 mV (*vs*. RHE) (Figure 4e). The stability of Ni3N-Co3N PNAs/NF is firstly evaluated by successive CV scan,

where the current densities remain stable after 5000 and 10000 cycles compared to the initial curve (Figure 4f), along with a slight increase of Rct (Figure S24). Furthermore, a multi-step chronoamperometric curve with working potential increasing from -0.074 to 0.326 V (*vs*. RHE) was conducted to investigate the overall features of the elctrode (Figure S25). As can be seen, the current density immediately levels off at 8 mA cm-2 at the start potential and remains unchanged for the remaining 300 s, and all steps show similar current responses, revealing the excellent conductivity, mass transportation, and mechanical robustness of Ni3N-Co3N PNAs/NF.[22] Finally, the current density can be stabilized at ~ 25 mA cm-2 over 40 h operation under chronoamperometry test at the working potential of -0.04 V (*vs*. RHE) (Figure 4g). In addition, the post-catalytic analysis (Figures S26-S28) also demonstrates that there are no obvious changes of structure can be deteced after the long-term HzOR test, which further confirms the satisfactory stability of the electrode.

Considering the superior catalytic performance of the Ni3N-Co3N PNAs/NF for both HER and HzOR, as well as the excellent long-term stability, a home-made two-electrode OHzS electrolyzer was assembled using the bifunctional Ni3N-Co3N PNAs/NF as both cathode and anode. The influence of hydrazine addition in electrolyte on the HER activity were firstly investigated (Figure S29, S30), where negligible decay can be observed, further indicating the feasibility of the HzOR assisted H<sup>2</sup> production. Figure 5a shows the comparing LSV curves of OHzS and OWS, which can ntuitively observe the significant activity improvement. As shown in Figure 5b, the OHzS system only needs small overpotentials of 0.668, 0.825, 0.964, and 1.09 V to drive the current densities of 100, 200, 300, and 400 mA cm-2 , respectively, which are considerably lower than that of OWS at the same current density. By eliminating the influence of ohmic drop (Figure S31), the corresponding cell voltages can be further reduced. Impressively, the catalytic activity of Ni3N-Co3N PNAs/NF electrode in OHzS system also outperforms the benchmark Pt/C couple (Figure S32). Moreover, the amount of experimentally generated H<sup>2</sup> matches well with the theoretically calculated amount during the hydrazine electrolysis process (Figure 5c), indicating the nearly 100% Faradic efficiency for H<sup>2</sup> production in OHzS. More importantly, the Ni3N-Co3N PNAs/NF couple shows remarkable long-term durability with 92.8% current density retaining rate after the continuous electrolysis over 20 h (Figure 5d). Noticeably, the OHzS performance of Ni3N-Co3N PNAs/NF in two-electrode hydrazine electrolyser is superior to those of recently reported bifunctional catalysts for both HER and HzOR (Table S3).

To illustrate the feasibility of Ni3N-Co3N PNAs/NF for potential practical applications, a self-powered H<sup>2</sup> production system was demonstrated by integrating a home-made direct hydrazine fuel cell (DHzFC) with an OHzS unit using Ni3N-Co3N PNAs/NF (Figure 6a) as the bifunctional catalyst. Hydrazine as sole consumable in our self-powered H<sup>2</sup> production system not only provides more convenience, but also its electrooxidation possesses high energy and power densities, as well as no greenhouse gases production. In addition, it should be noted that hydrazine is a toxic and instable chemical, thus the safe handling and storage technique have been proposed to address this problem.[23] Then, we assembled a DHzFC by using Ni3N-Co3N PNAs/NF as the anode containing 1.0 M KOH/0.5 M N2H<sup>4</sup> electrolyte, and the Pt/C loaded on carbon paper as cathode containing 1.0 M KOH electrolyte. The DHzFC exhibits a stable open-circuit voltage (OCV) of ~1.0 V at room temperature (Figure S33), implying its possible capability to power HzOR assisted H<sup>2</sup> production. Figure 6b depicts the discharge polarization curve and the corresponding power density curve, in which a peak power density of 60.3 mW cm-2 can be achieved at the output voltage of 0.495 V, comparable to those of the stateof-the-art values.[7a, 24] As a proof-of-concept, a self-powered H<sup>2</sup> production system was developed by integrating the OHzS unit with DHzFC (Figure 6c), where can observe vigorous generation of gas bubbles from the two electrode surfaces (Movie S2). Moreover, without external powers supplies, the amount of H<sup>2</sup> production at the cathode was further measured by gas chromatography analysis, as shown in Figure 6d. The H<sup>2</sup> yield shows a good linear relationship with electrolysis time, and the production rate is calculated to be 0.65 mmol h-1 , further demonstrating its prospects as efficient electrocatalysts for practical applications in renewable energy storage and conversion. Finally, the capability of the Ni3N-Co3N PNAs/NF catalyst for solar driven OHzS was also conducted using a commercial polycrystalline silicon solar cell under AM 1.5G simulated sunlight (Figure 6e). The solar cell provides an open circuit voltage of about 1.0 V (Figure S34), which could further achieve a high current density of ~214 mA cm-2 for H<sup>2</sup> generation (Figure 6f). Continues bubbling can be observed at both anode and cathode (Figure 6g and Movie S3), suggesting the feasibility of the solar-energy-driven hybrid water splitting on Ni3N-Co3N PNAs/NF electrode.

To disclose the possible origins of the superior bifunctional activity of Ni3N-Co3N PNAs/NF, the density functional theory (DFT) calculations were further performed. According to the HRTEM analysis, the Ni3N (001)/Co3N (001) surfaces are selected as the optimized model of Ni3N-Co3N heterostructure with small interfacial strain (Figure 7a). As comparison, the theoretical models of pure-phase Ni3N and Co3N were also illustrated (Figure S35). It is generally accepted that the Gibbs free energy of hydrogen absorption (∆GH\*) on the catalyst surface is a key parameter to evaluate the HER performance, where a near thermoneutral ∆GH\* value (∆GH\* ≈ 0 eV) could facilitate the hydrogen adsorption/desorption processes.[25] The optimized models for H\* adsorption on the Ni3N, Co3N, and Ni3N-Co3N heterointerface were presented in Figure S36. As

shown in the free-energy diagram (Figure 7b), the ∆GH\* of Ni3N-Co3N heterostructure (-0.04 eV) is much closer to the ideal ∆GH\* of 0 eV than that of Ni3N (-0.56 eV) and Co3N (-0.68 eV), which indicates the favorable H\* adsorption kinetics on Ni3N-Co3N toward the HER. Moreover, the charge density difference of the Ni3N-Co3N heterointerfaces (Figure 7c) suggests that the apparent electron accumulation on N atoms because of its high electronegativity, and the Ni sites are a relatively electron-rich state compared with the Co sites, which is probably due to the electronic interaction between Ni3N and Co3N, agreeing well with the above XPS analysis. This electron redistribution behavior on their coupling interfaces could optimize the reaction intermediates absorption energies and thus contributes to the enhanced catalytic activity. In addition, the total and partial density of states (DOS) for the Ni3N, Co3N, and Ni3N/Co3N (Figure S37) show that all the nitrides are continuous near the Fermi level (EF), indicating their metallic nature.[11, 26] Meanwhile, the d-band center (Ed) were calculated to be -1.67, -1.39, and - 1.44 eV for Ni3N, Co3N, and Ni3N-Co3N, respectively, in which the moderate E<sup>d</sup> value of Ni3N-Co3N could promote the most delicate balance between the adsorption and desorption, thus enabling the excellent bifunctional activity of the heterostructure.[27]

For the HzOR, the DFT calculations on the relationship

between the nitrides heterostructures and catalytic activity are still at the infant stage, thus it is particularly meaningful to decipher the underlying electrochemical reaction mechanism. It is known that the hydrazine oxidation process usually involves the adsorption hydrazine molecule and four consecutive dehydrogenation steps (N2H<sup>4</sup> → N2H<sup>3</sup> → N2H<sup>2</sup> → N2H → N2).[21a, 28] Therefore, we calculated the free energy of the adsorption hydrazine molecule and each dehydrogenation step on the Ni3N (001), the Co3N (001) and Ni3N (001)/Co3N (001) surfaces, respectively, as shown in Figure 7d. It should be noted that the adsorption of N2H4 on the Co site of Ni3N-Co3N surface is exothermic by 0.77 eV, lower than that of Ni site of Ni3N surface (0.66 eV) and Co site of Co3N surface (0.72 eV), indicating the electron-deficient Co species on the Ni3N/Co3N interface would facilitate the adsorption of the hydrazine molecule.[21] Further, the calculation results reveal that the rate-determining step (RDS) for Ni3N is the dehydrogenation from \*NH2NH to \*NHNH, while the dehydrogenation of \*NHNH to \*N2H is the RDS for Co3N, in which the free energy difference values for Ni3N (0.53 eV) is lower than that for Co3N (1.4 eV). More importantly, the RDS for Ni3N-Co3N heterostructure is also the formation of \*N2H with a minimum free energy change of 0.19 eV, which is consistent with higher HzOR activity of Ni3N-Co3N than single Ni3N and Co3N. These results demonstrate that the introduction

of Ni3N-Co3N heterointerface could effectively modulate the electronic structure of the nitrides, thus facilitates the thermodynamic behavior of both hydrogen adsorption for HER and dehydrogenation process for HzOR, and ultimately achiving the delicate reaction kinetics for superior bifunctionality.

#### **Conclusion**

In summary, we have developed a hierarchical porous nanosheet array electrode with abundant Ni3N-Co3N heterointerfaces on Ni foam (denoted as Ni3N-Co3N PNAs/NF) as highly active and robust electrocatalysts for both HER and HzOR under alkaline condition. Specifically, it can achieve the current density of 10 mA cm-2 at a low overpotential (η) of 43 mV with a small Tafel slope of 35.1 mV dec-1 for HER in 1.0 M KOH. For HzOR, Ni3N-Co3N PNAs/NF electrode only requires an ultralow working potential of -88 mV (*vs*. RHE) to reach 10 mA cm-2 in 1 M KOH/0.1 M N2H<sup>4</sup> electrolyte, and an ultrahigh current density of 1000 mA cm-2 can be reached at a potential of 200 mV (*vs*. RHE). Impressively, a two-electrode electrolyzer for overall hydrazine splitting (OHzS) utilizing the Ni3N-Co3N PNAs/NF electrodes as the bifunctional electrocatalysts can deliver current densities of 10 and 400 mA cm-2 at record-low cell voltages of mere 0.071 and 0.76 V, significantly outperforming its performances to that of overall water splitting (OWS). To prove the promising practical applications, the hydrazine-assisted electrolysis system can be directly driven by a home-made direct hydrazine fuel cell (DHzFC) and a commerical solar cell with a voltage of 1.0 V, and achieve decent H<sup>2</sup> production rates. Importantly, the DFT calculations suggest that interfacing Ni3N and Co3N could effectively modulate the electronic structure, further decreasing the free energy of the RDS for HzOR process, along with a more favorable ∆GH\* for HER. This work not only provides a deeper mechanistic understanding of heterostructured metal nitrides towards HER and HzOR catalytic activity, but also sheds new lights on the design and synthesis of advanced catalytic materials through surface and interface engineering.

An efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst toward hydrazine-assisted H<sup>2</sup> production was designed by constructing the Ni3N-Co3N heterointerfaces on Ni foam (Ni3N-Co3N PNAs/NF). The obtained catalyst can achieve energy-saving hydrogen production in an overall hydrazine splitting (OHzS) unit, showing its potential for practical applications.

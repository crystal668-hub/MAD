# **MoCx/CoP Janus Structure Embedded Carbon Frame for Boosting Hydrazine Oxidation and Hydrogen Evolution Reactions**

**The integration of hydrazine electrooxidation (HzOR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) presents an efficient pathway for high-purity hydrogen production. However, developing bifunctional catalysts remains challenging for the demands of multiple active-centers and tailored electronic properties. Here, a unique Janus nano-catalysts of MoCx/CoP embedded on carbon frameworks (MoCx/CoP@C) is introduced, featuring dual electronic states (depletion and accumulation)driven by charge redistribution within MoCx/CoP, acting as dual active-sites (DAS) for both HER and HzOR. Theoretical analysis reveals these independent DAS in MoCx/CoP significantly enhance catalytic activity for both HER and HzOR. Specifically, accumulated electrons at MoCx/CoP interfaces weaken the bonding strength of N-H in N2H4, thereby decreasing dehydrogenation energy barrier while electronic-deficient Mo sites within MoCx accelerate H\* desorption, thus promoting HER kinetics. This catalyst exhibits ultra-low potential of −73 mV at 10 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> for anodic HzOR, comparable to noble catalysts and low overpotential of 95 mV at 10 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> for cathodic HER. When employed in an overall hydrazine splitting (OHzS) system, MoCx/CoP@C shows promising commercial potential, with low energy consumption (0.16 V), high Faradaic efficiency (95.4%) and long-term stability. This study underscores the feasibility of designing independent DAS catalysts and elucidates the mechanistic origins of bifunctional activities.**

### **1. Introduction**

Hydrazine (N2H4) is commonly used in the pharmaceuticals, chemical industries, and propellant for aerospace. Due to its volatility and toxicity, hydrazine poses risks to water, soil, air, and living organisms. The U.S. EPA sets the occupational exposure limit at 10 ppb.[\[1,2\]](#page-7-0) Especially, the wastewater generated in the pharmaceutical industry often contains a very high concentration of hydrazine (≥30 g L<sup>−</sup>1), while many oxidation treatment technologies are only suitable for low-concentration hydrazine wastewater (≤1000 ppm) with additional oxidants (e.g., Fenton's reagent).[\[3,4\]](#page-7-0) Therefore, efficient technologies are highly desired to treat high-concentration hydrazine wastewater. The overall hydrazine splitting (OHzS), wherein thermodynamically favorable hydrazine oxidation (HzOR, N2H4 + 4OH<sup>−</sup> → N2 + 4H2O + 4e<sup>−</sup>, −0.33 V vs RHE) substitutes oxygen evolution reaction (OER) featuring sluggish kinetics and high energy consumption, offers an energy-effective and faster-kinetics alternative of traditional overall water splitting (OWS).[\[5–14\]](#page-7-0) Furthermore, hydrazine

oxidation-assistant HER benefits for the production of sustainable high-purity hydrogen gas (H2), the safe disposal of hydrazine and preventing the formation of harmful byproducts such as NH3 (3N2H4 → N2 + 4NH3 or N2H4 + OH<sup>−</sup> → 1/2N2 + NH3 + H2O + e<sup>−</sup>).[\[15–25\]](#page-8-0) Consequently, OHzS exhibits significant potential for clean energy conversion and environmental sustainability, spurring extensive research into cost-effective, bifunctional catalysts that are capable of driving both HzOR and HER.[\[26–28\]](#page-8-0)

The bifunctional electrocatalysts including the Pt-based noble metal and transition-metal-based catalysts have been extensively investigated. Among these, molybdenum carbides (MoCx) are promising active sites in electrocatalytic reactions due to their broadened *d*-band induced by carbon and adjustable density of states (DOS) near the Fermi level.[\[29–32\]](#page-8-0) However, their further developments in bifunctionally electrocatalyst are hindered by restrictive HER kinetics on account of the strong Mo─H bond and poor oxidation ability caused by limited oxidation state of Mo.[\[30,33\]](#page-8-0) Hence, the electronic engineer of MoCx via constructing

heterostructure with other transition metals for efficient bifunctional activities has been extensively explored. For example, Hu et al. developed an interface engineering of N-doped carbon nanoboxes encapsulated with Co/MoC nanoparticles, wherein the bifunctional activities were promoted by charge redistribution at the interfaces of MoC and Co.[\[34\]](#page-8-0) Additionally, Deng et al. synthesized Mo2C-CoO@*N*-CNFs film and utilized the synergistic effect of -Mo2C and CoO to moderate the hydrogen adsorption and improve the oxidation ability.[\[35\]](#page-8-0) Despite substantial progress, the rational design of bifunctional catalysts for higher performance is fundamentally constrained by the activity and selectivity trade-offs between different reactions and elusive active sites of both redox reactions, respectively. Therefore, engineering independent active sites on nanomaterials offers a promising approach to overcoming the challenges associated with bifunctional electrocatalysts.

Here, we synthesized MoCx/CoP@C Janus catalysts by growing MoCx/CoP anisotropic nanoparticles that dispersed on hollow carbon frameworks to form MoCx/CoP Janus structure with independent, dual active sites. This Janus catalyst only requires −73 mV overpotential for HzOR and −95 mV for HER at 10 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2, significantly outperforming commercial noble Pt/C at high current densities (*>*200 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2). When utilized as bifunctional catalysts in an OHzS system, MoCx/CoP@C requires only 0.16 V overpotential to achieve 10 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2, much lower than conventional overall water splitting (1.72 V). Furthermore, the MoCx/CoP@C catalyst maintains high activity for over 48 h for N2H4 conversion with a high Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 95.4%. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the bifunctional characteristics arise from the dual electronic states of MoCx/CoP Janus structure. The integrating of MoCx and CoP not only promotes the electron depletion at Mo sites of MoCx, wherein the H\* adsorption/desorption (ΔGH\*≈−0.15 eV) achieve an optimal equilibration at the cathode, but also facilitates the charge accumulation at the MoCx and CoP interface, thereby increasing DOSs around Fermi and accelerating the adsorption and dehydrogenation of N2H4 at the anode. In summary, the MoCx/CoP@C Janus catalyst presents greatly enhanced bifunctional activities, ascribed to the independent, dual electronic characteristics driven by the charge redistribution of MoCx/CoP Janus structure, thereby providing applicable active sites for both HER and HzOR.

# **2. Results and Discussion**

#### **2.1. Synthesis and Characterization**

MoCx/CoP@C Janus catalysts were synthesized by using surface coordination, carbonization and phosphorylation methods, as illustrated in **Figure 1**[a.](#page-2-0) First, ZIF-67 nano-cubes (ZIF-67 NCs) were synthesized as the substrate using a reported method (Figures S1a and S2, Supporting Information).[\[36–38\]](#page-8-0) PMo12 is connected to the Co species on the surface of ZIF-67NCs through the ligand (2-methylimidazole), resulting in Mo mainly concentrating on the surface edge of ZIF-67NCs, without changing the crystal structure of ZIF-67NCs (as shown in XRD patterns of Figure S1a, Supporting Information). The uniform dispersion of Mo on the ZIF-67 frames shown in EDX mappings (Figure S3, Supporting Information) verified the successful introduction of Mo element. As for the P element, due to 12 MoO42<sup>−</sup> groups being attached around PO43<sup>−</sup> in the structure of sodium phosphomolybdate and the P─O bond being relatively stable in aqueous solution, P is more difficult to install on the surface of ZIF-67NCs compared with Mo. Moreover, Subsequent carbonization in H2/N2 atmosphere at 800 °C yielded m-MoCx/Co@C, characterized by the XRD diffraction peaks of Co (PDF#15-0806) in Figure S1b (Supporting Information), Electronic Microscopy images (Figures S4–S8, Supporting Information) and ICP-OES (Table S1, Supporting Information). Thus, the P element in PMo12 has almost no impact on the subsequent material synthesis. Stepwise phosphorylation with NaH2PO2 under an N2 atmosphere yielded the final catalysts MoCx/CoP@C, characterized by SEM (Figure S9, Supporting Information) and XRD (Figure S10, Supporting Information). It's worth mentioning that the XRD diffraction peaks of MoCx/CoP@C coincide with those of CoP (PDF#29-0497). According to the ICP-OES results in Table S1 (Supporting Information), the Mo element content is too low (only 1.4 wt.%), and the MoCx particles in the Janus structure are too small (no more than 5 nm) as shown in the subsequent TEM characterization, resulting in the inability of XRD to detect the peaks related to MoCx. On the other hand, the absence of MoCx diffraction peaks also proves that MoCx does not aggregate to form larger nanoparticles but combines with CoP to form a Janus structure. Pure MoCx@C and CoP@C were also synthesized using the same method as reference catalysts (Figures S11–S16, Supporting Information).

To investigate the chemical states and electronic structures of the as-prepared MoCx/CoP@C, XPS measurements were performed (Figure S17a, Supporting Information). In the Mo 3d spectra Figure [1b\)](#page-2-0), the peaks at 228.46 and 231.61 eV are attributed to Mo<sup>+</sup> (0 *<<* 4) species, corresponding to the Mo─C bond, while the peaks at 229.81/232.96 and 232.61/235.76 eV are assigned to Mo4<sup>+</sup> and Mo6<sup>+</sup>, likely due to surface oxidation.[\[34,39–42\]](#page-8-0) Compared with MoCx@C, the Mo 3d peaks in MoCx/CoP@C shift to higher binding energies, indicating electron transfer from Mo to the adjacent CoP in the MoCx/CoP@C. Additionally, compared with CoP@C, the binding energies of Co-P and Co-POx in MoCx/CoP@C shift slightly from 778.83/793.88 to 778.98/794.03 eV and from 781.17/796.22 to 781.84/796.89 eV, respectively (Figure [1c\)](#page-2-0).[\[26,43,44\]](#page-8-0) The XPS spectra of non-metals were also analyzed. In the P 2p spectrum of MoCx/CoP@C (Figure [1d\)](#page-2-0), the P-Co (129.58 and 130.38 eV) and P-O (134.32 eV) peaks exhibit a negative shift of ≈0.2 eV compared to those in CoP@C.[\[38,45\]](#page-8-0) In the C 1s spectrum (Figure S17b, Supporting Information), the metal-C peak in MoCx/CoP shows a slight upward shift compared to MoCx@C.[\[34,36,46\]](#page-8-0) The N 1s spectrum (Figure S17c, Supporting Information) confirms the presence of pyridinic-N, pyrrolic-N, and graphitic-N dopants.[\[46\]](#page-8-0) Collectively, these results demonstrate charge transfer from MoCx to CoP through the MoCx/CoP interface, leading to electron depletions in MoCx part and electron accumulations on the surface of MoCx/CoP interface.

To further investigate the structures of the as-prepared catalyst, aberration-corrected high-annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDXs) mappings were conducted. Largefield view of STEM images reveals the hollow cubic structure of

High-magnification STEM image (Figure 2b) of an individual MoC<sub>x</sub>/CoP@C nanocube shows the coexistence of MoC<sub>v</sub> and CoP nanoparticles as demonstrated by EDX mappings of Molybdenum (Mo), Cobalt (Co) and Phosphorus (P) elements in Figure 2c. Intriguingly, high-resolution STEM images unravel the Janus structure of MoC<sub>v</sub>/CoP in MoC<sub>x</sub>/CoP@C. As shown in Figure 2d,f and Figures S18-S20 (Supporting Information), abundant Janus particles formed by the partial MoC<sub>v</sub> and larger CoP nanoparticles can be clearly distinguished from the CoP nanoparticles with lattice constant of 1.89 nm (211), 0.20 nm (210), and MoC<sub>x</sub> with lattice spacing of 0.251 nm and 0.224 nm, assigned to the (100) planes of MoC and (101) planes of Mo<sub>2</sub>C, respectively. [46] The plentiful interfaces formed by MoC<sub>v</sub> and CoP nanoparticles can be further testified by the Mo and Co element dispersions from the corresponding EDX mappings (Figure 2e,g; Figure S20, Supporting Information), which contribute to numerous active sites for electrocatalytic reactions. Further atomic-resolution STEM images (Figure 2h,i) show the atomic morphologies of MoC<sub>v</sub> on CoP nanoparticles. On the other hand, these MoC<sub>x</sub> and CoP interfaces on the hollow carbon frame contribute to a larger specific surface area (156.55 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>) as well as abundant mesopores according to the BET test

(Figure S21, Supporting Information), thus provide numerous active sites for bifunctionally electrocatalytic performance even with limited Mo loading.

#### 2.2. Electrocatalytic Performances

The electrocatalytic performances of as-prepared catalysts were assessed in 0.5 м hydrazine/1.0 м КОН electrolyte via the threeelectrode system with Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode and a graphite rod as the counter electrode. The catalytic activities of HzOR were first evaluated with the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves (Figure 3a; Figure S24, Supporting Information), MoC<sub>x</sub>/CoP@C features substantially low potentials of -73 and 38 mV (vs RHE) to achieve current density of 10 and 100 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, tremendously outcompeting the performance of MoC<sub>v</sub>@C, CoP@C, CoP@C/MoC<sub>v</sub>@C and other reported catalysts (Table S2, Supporting Information). The rapid reaction kinetics of MoCx/CoP@C for HzOR is further evidenced by the exceptional Tafel slope (40 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>) in Figure 3b, which significantly superior to that of MoC<sub>v</sub>@C (71 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>), CoP@C (52 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>), Pt/C (55 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>) and CoP@C/MoC<sub>x</sub>@C (53 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>). The greater exchange current density J<sub>0</sub> during the equilibrium proves the enhanced activity of MoC<sub>x</sub>/CoP@C

(Figure S25, Supporting Information). The excellent charge transfer efficiency of MoCx/CoP@C has been revealed by the lowest charge transfer resistance (Rct) value (≈ 3.5 Ω) from the Nyquist curves of EIS (Figure [3c\)](#page-4-0) and the LSV curves of HzOR under varied scan rates (Figure S26, Supporting Information). Furthermore, its high electrochemically active surface areas (ECSAs) (Figures S27 and S28, Supporting Information) are demonstrated by the larger electrochemical double-layer capacitance (Cdl) of MoCx/CoP@C (63.06 mF cm−2), in compari-

son to that of MoCx@C (12.39 mF cm<sup>−</sup>2) and CoP@C (27.15 mF cm<sup>−</sup>2). Additionally, the outstanding catalytic efficiencies of MoCx/CoP@C catalysts are confirmed by an exceptional turnover frequency (TOF) value of 10.58 s<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> at 0.1 V (vs RHE, Figures S29 and S30, Supporting Information) and ultrahigh Faradaic efficiencies (FE = 95.4%) of hydrazine conversion (Figure [3d;](#page-4-0) Figure S31, Supporting Information). In aspect of energy saving, it only requires the working potentials of−73, 38, and 90 mV (vs RHE) to reach the current density of 10, 100, and 200 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> for HzOR,

respectively, while OER needs much higher potentials of 1.53, 1.61, and 1.65 V (vs RHE) to drive the same current density as shown in Figure 3e,f and Figure S32 (Supporting Information). The superiority in dynamics and thermodynamics of HzOR provides the possibility of HzOR-assisted OHzS with MoC<sub>v</sub>/CoP@C. Additionally, the admirable catalytic stability of MoC<sub>x</sub>/CoP@C was demonstrated via the constant current density at 15 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> within 48-h chronoamperometry (CA) test (Figure \$33, Supporting Information) and a slight increase of overpotential at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> ( $\Delta \eta \approx 50$  mV) after 7000 and 14 000 cycles of CV (inset in Figure \$33, Supporting Information). The morphology and phase exhibited negligible changes after the stability test (Figures \$34-\$36, Supporting Information), also verifying the long-term catalytic performances of MoC<sub>v</sub>/CoP@C in HzOR.

Hydrogen evolution performance was also investigated in an alkaline solution (1.0 m KOH) with the same three-electrode system. The LSV polarization curves with 98% IR compensation in Figure 4a manifest that the performance of MoC<sub>v</sub>/CoP@C exhibits a noticeable improvement than CoP@C and MoC, @C. The MoC<sub>v</sub>/CoP@C catalyst presents low overpotentials of 95 and 195 mV (vs RHE) for achieving 10 and 100 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, respectively (Figure 4b), wherein CoP@C, MoC<sub>x</sub>@C, CoP@C/MoC<sub>x</sub>@C (Figure \$37a,b, Supporting Information) and most reported Co or Mo based electrocatalysts (Table \$3, Supporting Information) are not comparable. Notably, MoC<sub>v</sub>/CoP@C displays excellent activity after a large current density (>200 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>), surpassing

the state-of-the-art 20% Pt/C catalyst, suggesting its superior conductivity. As shown in Figure 4c, the Tafel slope of MoC<sub>v</sub>/CoP@C (71 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>) reveals much faster reaction dynamics with increasing potential, which is far more ahead of MoC<sub>x</sub>@C (136 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>), CoP@C (119 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>) and CoP@C/MoC<sub>x</sub>@C (123 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>, Figure S37c, Supporting Information). Meanwhile, such Tafel slope suggests the faster HER route occurred on MoC<sub>v</sub>/CoP@C follows a Volmer–Heyrovsky mechanism (H<sub>2</sub>O +  $e^{-} + * \rightarrow H^{*} + OH^{-}, H^{*} + H_{2}O + e^{-} \rightarrow H_{2} + OH^{-}$ ) and the RDS is the desorption of hydrogen. Moreover, the greater exchange current density (j<sub>0</sub>) of MoC<sub>x</sub>/CoP@C reflects the favorable intrinsic electrocatalytic activity (Figure S38, Supporting Information). The associated Nyquist plots are shown in Figure 4d, among the obtained materials, MoC<sub>v</sub>/CoP@C exhibits a smaller charge transfer resistance ( $R_{ct}$ ) of 2.4  $\Omega$ , which represents the faster electron transport rate at the interface between the electrolyte and catalyst. Besides, the exceptionally intrinsic catalytic activity of MoC<sub>x</sub>/CoP@C catalyst was manifested by a high TOF values  $(0.545 \text{ s}^{-1})$  at the overpotential of 100 mV (vs RHE), greatly surpassing CoP@C (0.288 s<sup>-1</sup>), MoC@C (0.355 s<sup>-1</sup>) and other catalysts (Figure S39, Supporting Information). The excellent stability of MoC<sub>x</sub>/CoP@C catalysts was shown in the long-term durability test with steady current density of 20 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> in 30-h CA (Figure 4e) and negligible change of polarization curve after 14 000 cycles CV (inset Figure 4e). In addition, the characterizations of the STEM (Figure \$40, Supporting Information), XRD (Figure S41, Supporting Information), and XPS (Figure S42,

Supporting Information) reveal the morphology and phase of MoCx/CoP@C keep stable after catalytic reaction. Based on the excellent catalytic performance of MoCx/CoP@C toward HER and HzOR, it was applied as catalysts for both anode and cathode electrodes in a two-electrode OHzS system. As shown in Figure 4f, compared with the voltages of 1.72 and 1.92 V at 10 and 100 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> in the OWS system, the OHzS only requires much lower voltages of 0.16 and 0.51 V to reach the same current density, indicating a significant improvement in performance. Meanwhile, the catalytic activity of MoCx/CoP@C in OHzS can be comparable to that of a two-electrode unit driven by Pt/C//Pt/C in Figure S43 (Supporting Information). Moreover, the MoCx/CoP@C couple shows satisfactory long-term durability with an almost unattenuated current density after 48-h contin-

uous electrolysis (Figure 4g), credited to the independently dual active sites of MoCx/CoP Janus structure. In brief, the results collectively suggest that the MoCx/CoP@C catalyst has potential for commercial OHzS applications because of its cost-effectiveness, remarkable efficiency, and stability.

#### **2.3. Theoretical Investigations**

To shed light on the role of MoCx/CoP Janus structure and intrinsic active sites in electrocatalytic mechanism, DFT calculations including HER and HzOR processes have been conducted (details can be seen in Supporting information). The optimized model of MoCx/CoP Janus structure was constructed with MoC

<span id="page-6-0"></span>**Figure 5.** Investigation of catalytic origin over MoCx/CoP Janus structure. a) Theoretical model of MoCx/CoP Janus structure. b) The charge density difference of MoC-CoP structure with the green (orange) region represents the charge accumulation (deletion) and the iso surface value is 0.003 eÅ<sup>−</sup>3.

(100) plane and CoP (211) plane (**Figure 5**a). As comparison, the pure-phase MoC and CoP models were illustrated as well (Figure S44, Supporting Information). First of all, charge density difference of MoC/CoP structure was calculated to elucidate the electronic interaction between MoC and CoP. As shown in Figure 5b, the charge redistribution is represented by the orange region (electronic depletion) and green region (electronic accumulation) respectively. The electron depletion at Mo atom sites of MoC and charge accumulation at the surface of MoC and CoP interface reveal an apparent charge transfer from MoC to CoP, stemming from the electronegativity of P, which demonstrates the dually electronic characteristics of MoC/CoP Janus

structure. Furthermore, the total and partial density of states (DOSs) of MoC/CoP, MoC and CoP were investigated (Figure 5c), respectively. Noticeably, the MoC/CoP structure present larger DOSs than MoC and CoP around the Femi level, reflecting relatively higher conductivity and electron-transfer efficiency upon MoC/CoP interface.[\[40\]](#page-8-0) The d-band center value of MoC/CoP (−0.41 eV of Mo and −1.19 eV of Co) is relatively moderate to Femi level compared with those of MoC (−0.55 eV) and CoP (−1.28 eV), reflecting the advantages for binding strength of reactants.[\[47,48\]](#page-8-0)

To clarify the insight of dual reaction centers in MoCx/CoP Janus structure, the catalytical mechanism probing including

<span id="page-7-0"></span>HER and HzOR is conducted. For HER kinetics, the adsorption behavior of water and further hydrogen adsorption/desorption equilibrium process are both evaluated. First, the water adsorption energy in Figure [5d](#page-6-0) and Figure S45 (Supporting Information) displays a more negative value of MoC/CoP interfaces (−0.98 eV) relative to MoC (−0.71 eV) and CoP (−0.87 eV). The lower *d*-band center of Mo and Co contributes to decreasing the filling of antibonding states formed with *d* bands of metals and renormalized (by bonding to the metal *sp*-states) O 2*p*, thereby facilitating the adsorption of water at the reaction centers of MoC/CoP interfaces and formation of H\* (Volmer reaction).[\[44,49\]](#page-8-0) Additionally, the hydrogen adsorption free energy (ΔGH\*) of different reaction sites were analyzed to evaluate chemical desorption of adsorbed H\* (Heyrovsky reaction or Tafel reaction). Intriguingly, electronic-depletion site (Mo atom) in MoC/CoP (MoC/CoP (ED), −0.15 eV) demonstrates more neutral ΔGH\* than these of electronic-accumulation site (MoC/CoP (EA), −0.85 eV), MoC (−0.83 eV) and CoP (−0.28 eV) in Figure [5e](#page-6-0) and Figure S46 (Supporting Information). We speculate that the adsorbed H\* is driven by the surface micro-electric field formed with charge difference in such MoC/CoP Janus configuration, thus migrates from interface to Mo[\[50\]](#page-8-0) site, which is preferable for desorption. Therefore, the electronic redistribution in MoC/CoP Janus moderates the electronic states of MoCx for preferential adsorption of water at electron-rich interfaces and thermodynamical desorption of hydrogen at electron-deficient Mo sites, thereby boosts its electrocatalytic activity of HER.[\[40,50\]](#page-8-0) Besides, the mechanism of HzOR was investigated by calculating free energy of N2H4 adsorption and consecutive dehydrogenation steps from adsorbed NH2-NH2 \* to N2. Consequently, when the interfaces of MoC/CoP were chosen as the active sites, a more negative adsorption energy of N2H4 on the interface of MoC/CoP (−3.19 eV) than MoC (−2.93 eV) and CoP (−2.71 eV) was obtained (Figure [5e;](#page-6-0) Figure S47, Supporting Information). This superiorly spontaneous adsorption of N2H4 arising from electronic accumulations at the MoC/CoP interface, which undoubtedly is beneficial for HzOR.[\[26\]](#page-8-0) Furthermore, the free energies of intermediates during dehydrogenation processes (Figure [5g;](#page-6-0) Figure S48, Supporting Information) reveal that the potential-determining step (PDS) for MoC, CoP, and MoC/CoP is the dehydrogenation from \*N2H2 to \*N2H. In MoC/CoP system, the electronic doping from MoC/CoP interfaces weakens the strong interaction between N atom and H atom in N2H4, resulting in a notably lower Gibbs free energy barrier of 0.31 eV, wherein MoC and CoP need 0.90 and 0.69 eV to overcome the energy barrier, respectively. These results reveal that the electronic-accumulation sites of MoC/CoP interface promote both thermodynamics (more negative adsorption energy of N2H4) and kinetics (lower barrier energy) of HzOR. The above theoretical investigations corroborating our analysis identify the mechanistic origins of the efficiently bifunctional activities of MoCx/CoP@C Janus catalyst.

**3. Conclusion**

We employed ion exchange and calcination methods to synthesize MoCx/CoP Janus structure on carbon frames to develop a bifunctional catalyst with separately dual active sites. This MoCx/CoP@C catalyst featuring anisotropic Janus structure with dual electronic states exhibits both ultra-low potentials of HzOR (−73 mV at 10 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2) and HER (−95 mV at 10 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2) in alkaline conditions, attributed to the dual active sites of the electronic depletion part from MoCx and the electronic accumulation of MoCx/CoP interfaces, respectively. DFT calculations suggest that the alloying of MoCx and CoP promotes electron redistribution, wherein the electron-deficient Mo sites within MoCx facilitate H\* desorption, thereby accelerating HER kinetics, while the electron-rich MoCx/CoP interfaces weaken the N─H bond in N2H4, lowering the dehydrogenation energy barrier. Therefore, this type of Janus nano-catalysts with DAS emerges as promising, cost-effective, bifunctional catalysts with remarkable activity, high efficiency, and excellent stability for overall OHzS.

Abstract: Hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) represents a promising low-energy pathway for sustainable hydrogen production, yet mechanistic ambiguities and catalyst instability hinder its practical implementation. Herein, we elucidate the dual-pathway nature of HzOR on cobalt-based catalysts, involving direct electrooxidation on metallic Co and mediated oxidation via the redox cycle between metallic Co and cobalt hydroxide species. This mechanistic insight moves beyond the traditional focus on solely enhancing the intrinsic activity in the direct pathway. Instead, it highlights the chemical redox reaction between hydrazine and Co(II) as a central process that not only regenerates metallic Co sites for direct pathway but also drives the mediated oxidation route. Guided by this understanding, we designed a defectrich cobalt catalyst through a one-step electrodeposition method, enabling fast chemical reduction of oxidized Co species by hydrazine. As a result, the catalyst delivers superior HzOR performance, reaching a current density of 100 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> at only -79 mV versus reversible hydrogen electrode, along with outstanding long-term stability. Combined electrochemical and density functional theory (DFT) analyses reveal that defect engineering significantly promotes the dual-pathway HzOR on Co-based catalysts. This work provides mechanistic understanding of HzOR electrocatalysis and highlights a general strategy for designing efficient, durable non-noble metal electrocatalysts.

#### Introduction

Hydrogen, a zero-carbon and high-energy-density energy carrier, plays a crucial role in the global pursuit of carbon neutrality.<sup>[1]</sup> Among various production pathways, electrochemical water splitting is especially attractive due to its compatibility with renewable energy sources such as solar and

wind.<sup>[2]</sup> However, its practical implementation is hindered by the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER,  $4OH^- \rightarrow$  $O_2 + 2H_2O + 4e^-$ ), which features a high thermodynamic potential (1.23 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE) and sluggish four-electron transfer kinetics.<sup>[3,4]</sup> To overcome the limitations of OER, the anodic oxidation of alternative small molecules such as urea,<sup>[5]</sup> alcohols,<sup>[6]</sup> aldehydes,<sup>[7]</sup> and hydrazine<sup>[8,9]</sup> has gained considerable attention. Among these alternatives, the hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR,  $N_2H_4 + 4OH^- \rightarrow N_2 + 4H_2O + 4e^-$ ) possesses a much lower theoretical potential (-0.33 V versus RHE) and offers distinct advantages.[10,11] Specifically, HzOR-coupled hydrogen production yields only N<sub>2</sub> as a by-product, eliminating the risk of H<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>2</sub> mixing and explosion, thereby enabling the design of membrane-free electrolyzers.[12,13] Moreover, integrating HzOR with water electrolysis presents an attractive strategy for the simultaneous production of hydrogen and treatment of hydrazine-containing industrial wastewater.[14,15] Despite these benefits, HzOR remains a kinetically demanding multistep process, which requires high overpotentials under practical conditions. Therefore, the development of anodic electrocatalysts with high activity and long-term durability is essential to realize the full potential of HzOR-assisted hydrogen production.

Among various candidates for HzOR electrocatalysts, 3d transition metal cobalt has emerged as a particularly promising material with remarkable HzOR activity.[16,17] Notably, the catalytic performances of Co-based catalysts can surpass those of benchmark noble-metal catalysts such as Pt under certain conditions.<sup>[18,19]</sup> However, the fundamental mechanisms of HzOR on Co-based catalysts remain elusive, particularly regarding the dynamic surface reconstruction of Co species during HzOR. Specifically, increasing the applied anodic potential induces the in situ oxidation of Co(0) to Co(II), primarily in the form of Co(OH)<sub>2</sub>.<sup>[20]</sup> Conversely, lower potentials favor the reduction of Co(II), while the reductive hydrazine in the electrolyte persistently provides a driving force for cobalt regeneration. This redox process involves a complex interplay of factors, and a comprehensive understanding of its mechanisms and the influence of catalyst reconstruction on HzOR activity remains lacking. Gaining in-depth mechanistic insights into these aspects is essential for rational catalyst design and the practical deployment of HzOR technologies.

Current studies on electrocatalytic HzOR typically regarded it as a direct electrooxidation process<sup>[21,22]</sup> (Scheme 1a), where the reactants are oxidized through

direct electron transfer on the anodic catalyst surface, without significant changes in the active phase. Accordingly, catalyst design strategies for HzOR have largely focused on optimizing the intermediate adsorption on as-prepared catalysts. For example, Zhang et al. significantly lowered the dehydrogenation barrier of \*NH2NH2 on Co3N nanowires through dual doping with P and W, thereby boosting catalytic performance.[\[23\]](#page-11-0) Yang et al. designed a bifunctional Mn@Ni3N–Co3N/NF catalyst, in which Mn modulates interfacial charge redistribution, enabling an industrial-level current density of 500 mA cm−<sup>2</sup> at only 0.49 V.[\[24\]](#page-11-0) Notably, in addition to direct electrooxidation, the mediated pathway is also extensively identified in electrochemical oxidation reactions.[\[25\]](#page-11-0) In such cases, redoxactive mediators are electrochemically oxidized on the anode and subsequently undergo nonelectrochemical redox reactions with the reactant (Scheme 1b). This mechanism has been widely demonstrated in the oxidation of small organic molecules such as glucose and aldehydes. For example, Wang et al. employed a Cu(I)/Cu(II) redox cycle to mediate glucose oxidation, achieving 100 mA cm−<sup>2</sup> at an input voltage as low as 0.92 V.[\[26\]](#page-11-0) As discussed above, under operating potentials of HzOR, metallic Co(0) can be oxidized to Co(II), while hydrazine serves as a chemical reductant to regenerate Co(0) from Co(II). This establishes the possibility of a redoxmediated indirect pathway based on a Co(0)/Co(II) redox couple. Therefore, both direct and mediated pathways may coexist during HzOR on cobalt-based catalysts. Elucidating this dual-pathway behavior, alongside designing catalysts with consideration of the Co(0)/Co(II) redox cycle, could enable new opportunities for further enhancing the performance of Co-based HzOR electrocatalysts.

Inspired by these insights, we systematically unveil the coexistence of dual pathways in Co-catalyzed HzOR. Specifically, hydrazine is oxidized either directly at metallic Co sites or indirectly via a mediated pathway involving redox cycling between Co(0) and Co(II) species. In this dual-pathway process, the coupled redox step involving the chemical oxidation of hydrazine and the reduction of Co(II) to Co(0) is central to the overall mechanism, as it not only drives the mediated process but also regenerates the active metallic Co sites for direct oxidation. Guided by this mechanistic understanding, we designed a defect-rich cobalt catalyst on carbon cloth (D-Co/CC), which preserves abundant surface defects even after oxidation. These defects facilitate rapid redox reactions between Co(II) and hydrazine, enabling continuous regeneration of catalytically active Co(0) sites. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the introduction of defects lowers the energy barrier of the chemical reduction of Co(II) by hydrazine while also enhancing the intrinsic activity of Co(0) for the direct pathway. As a result, D-Co/CC exhibits outstanding HzOR performance in 1.0 M KOH/0.5 M N2H4 electrolyte, reaching current densities of 100, 200, and 500 mA cm−<sup>2</sup> at ultralow potentials of −79, −51, and −10 mV versus RHE, respectively, along with excellent operational stability over 150 h. When integrated into a hydrazine-assisted water splitting system, the D-Co/CC||Pt/C electrolyzer operates at cell voltages of just 93 and 189 mV to drive 100 and 200 mA cm−2, respectively, marking a substantial advance over previously reported systems. These results highlight the effectiveness of mechanism-guided design strategies for electrocatalysts.

#### *Results and Discussion*

#### *Structural Characterizations*

The defect-rich D-Co/CC catalyst was synthesized via a simple one-step electrodeposition method (see details in Supporting Information). As shown in the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image (Figure [1a\)](#page-2-0), D-Co/CC exhibits a uniform layer of interconnected nanosheets covering the entire CC substrate. Similar morphologies are observed for catalysts prepared under different electrodeposition potentials (Figure S1), indicating good morphological reproducibility. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis in Figure [1b](#page-2-0) further verifies the nanosheet structure, while the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (inset of Figure [1b\)](#page-2-0) reveals diffraction rings matching the (101) and (201) planes of metallic Co. High-resolution TEM (HRTEM, Figure [1c\)](#page-2-0) characterization shows lattice fringes with a spacing of 2.06 Å, corresponding to the Co (111) plane. This nanosheet architecture is expected to enhance charge and mass transport while enabling efficient bubble release from the catalyst surface. The formation of metallic Co is also verified by

X-ray diffraction (XRD, Figure S2). Diffraction peaks at 41.7°, 44.7°, 47.5°, 62.7°, 75.9°, and 84.1° are indexed to the (100), (002), (101), (102), (110), and (103) planes of metallic cobalt (JCPDS No. 05-0727), respectively. To facilitate subsequent structure–activity relationship analysis, a Co/CC catalyst with few defects was prepared by hightemperature hydrogen reduction of cobalt hydroxides. XRD analysis (Figure S2), together with TEM and HRTEM images (Figure S3), confirms that Co/CC also possesses a metallic Co phase with similar crystallographic features.

The elemental composition and chemical state information of the catalysts are then investigated. Elemental mapping (Figure 1d) demonstrates the homogeneous distribution of Co and O within the D-Co/CC nanosheets, with the presence of oxygen likely originating from the surface oxidation upon exposure to air. The surface oxidation is further confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), which shows the predominance of Co2<sup>+</sup> on the surface of D-Co/CC (Figure S4).[\[27,28\]](#page-11-0) After argon ion etching, metallic Co species in the bulk region of the catalyst can be detected by XPS. As shown in Figure 1e, the Co 2p spectrum of D-Co/CC displays two peaks at 777.9 and 792.9 eV, corresponding to Co0, along with peaks at 780.3 eV (Co 2p3/2) and 796.1 eV (Co 2p1/2) attributed to Co<sup>2</sup>+, as well as satellite features at 785.2 and 802.2 eV.[\[29,30\]](#page-11-0) Control experiments on Co(OH)2 (containing only Co<sup>2</sup>+) show negligible changes in Co 2p binding energies

before and after sputtering (Figure S5), confirming that the observed metallic Co signal in D-Co/CC originates from the intrinsic catalyst state rather than sputtering-induced reduction. Notably, the Co/CC control sample exhibits nearly identical Co 2p binding energy positions compared with D-Co/CC. These results collectively indicate that D-Co/CC and Co/CC possess similar crystalline phases and cobalt valence states.

To further probe the local electronic structure and coordination environment, X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectroscopy was conducted at the Co K-edge. In the normalized X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra (Figure [1f\)](#page-2-0), the absorption edge energies for both D-Co/CC and Co/CC closely align with that of a Co foil reference, indicating that the average oxidation state of Co in both samples is close to zero, in agreement with analyses discussed above. Furthermore, the oscillation function curves of all samples at the *k* range of 0–10 Å−<sup>1</sup> show good consistency, except for the notably reduced oscillation amplitude in D-Co/CC (Figure S6), implying its distinct local coordination environment around Co centers.[\[31\]](#page-11-0)

To obtain more detailed structural information, extended XAFS (EXAFS) was obtained by the Fourier transformation (FT) from the above XAFS data. Both D-Co/CC and Co/CC display a strong peak at 2.18 Å, corresponding to Co─Co coordination (Figure [1g\)](#page-2-0). Notably, the Co─Co peak intensity in D-Co/CC is markedly lower than that in Co/CC. Quantitative fitting (Figure S7 and Table S1) reveals a significantly reduced Co─Co coordination number for D-Co/CC relative to both Co foil and Co/CC, indicating an unsaturated metallic-Co environment and a higher defect concentration in D-Co/CC. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy further supports this conclusion, with D-Co/CC exhibiting a pronounced Co-vacancy signal at *g* = 2.004 (Figure S8).[\[32,33\]](#page-11-0) Wavelet-transform (WT) analysis of the Co K-edge EXAFS shows that all samples exhibit *k*-space peaks centered around ∼7.5 Å−<sup>1</sup> (Figure [1h–j\)](#page-2-0), corresponding to Co─Co bonding, further verifying their consistent metallic cobalt structure. Taken together, structural characterizations demonstrate that while D-Co/CC and Co/CC share nearly identical phase structures and Co valence states, D-Co/CC uniquely features a more unsaturated Co coordination environment, reflecting its defect-rich nature.

#### *Electrocatalytic HzOR Performance*

The electrocatalytic HzOR activity was evaluated in a standard three-electrode setup using a mixed electrolyte of 1.0 M KOH and 0.5 M N2H4, with a Hg/HgO reference electrode and a graphite rod counter electrode. The optimal electrodeposition potential for D-Co/CC was first identified (Figure S9). The sample prepared at −2.0 V delivers the highest catalytic performance and is thus selected for further investigation.

Figure [2a](#page-4-0) shows the *iR*-corrected linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves at a scan rate of 5 mV s−<sup>1</sup> (noncorrected data are presented in Figure S10). D-Co/CC requires a potential of only −153 mV (versus RHE, the same below unless otherwise noted) to achieve 10 mA cm−2, far lower than Co/CC (−70 mV) and commercial Pt-C/CC (12 mV). Impressively, D-Co/CC maintains negative working potentials of only −79, −51, and −10 mV even at higher current densities of 100, 200, and 500 mA cm−2, respectively. Corresponding Tafel plots (Figure [2b\)](#page-4-0) reveal a low Tafel slope of 18.3 mV dec−<sup>1</sup> for D-Co/CC, greatly smaller than those of Co/CC (58.6 mV dec−1) and Pt-C/CC (37.2 mV dec−1), indicating significantly accelerated HzOR kinetics. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) further attributes this outstanding performance to a greatly reduced charge-transfer resistance (*R*ct). In the equivalent circuit model (inset of Figure [2c\)](#page-4-0), *R*<sup>s</sup> denotes the solution resistance, *R*ct the chargetransfer resistance, and *Q*CPE the constant-phase element at the electrode/electrolyte interface.[\[34\]](#page-11-0) Fitted values (Table S2) confirm that D-Co/CC exhibits the lowest *R*ct among the samples, validating its superior charge-transfer kinetics. To evaluate the intrinsic catalytic activity of the catalysts, the electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) was estimated from the double-layer capacitance (*C*dl) values (Figure S11). D-Co/CC exhibits a *C*dl of 30.7 mF cm−2, which is substantially higher than that of Co/CC (12.2 mF cm−2) (Figure S12), likely due to its defect-rich structure, which enhances electrolyte contact. Notably, even after ECSA normalization, D-Co/CC still possesses a markedly superior current density compared with Co/CC (Figure S13), demonstrating its outstanding intrinsic activity toward HzOR.

LSV measurements with varying N2H4 concentrations reveal a monotonic increase in anodic current density (Figure S14), pointing to hydrazine oxidation as the primary contributor to the observed current response. Moreover, changing LSV scan rates in the range of 10–50 mV s−<sup>1</sup> leads to negligible variation in the HzOR performance of D-Co/CC (Figure [2d\)](#page-4-0), suggesting efficient charge/mass transport during HzOR.[\[35\]](#page-11-0) To illustrate the energy-saving advantage of HzOR, Figure [2e](#page-4-0) compares the HzOR performance of D-Co/CC with the OER performance in 1.0 M KOH catalyzed by NiFe layered double hydroxides (NiFe-LDH), a widely recognized high-performance non-noble-metal catalyst for OER. D-Co/CC reaches 200 mA cm−<sup>2</sup> at just −51 mV, whereas NiFe-LDH requires 1.72 V to deliver the same current density, demonstrating that replacing OER with HzOR can drastically reduce the energy input for hydrogen production. Furthermore, the overpotential at 10 mA cm−<sup>2</sup> and Tafel slope of D-Co/CC surpass those of most reported non-noble-metal catalysts (Figure [2f](#page-4-0) and Table S3). Chronoamperometry test at an initial current density of 100 mA cm−<sup>2</sup> (Figure [2g\)](#page-4-0) shows that D-Co/CC retains 98.8% of its initial value after 150 h, while Co/CC deactivates severely within just 5 h (inset: actual experimental setup). Accelerated durability tests (ADTs) over 5000 and 10 000 cycles (Figure [2h\)](#page-4-0) induce negligible performance degradation, further corroborating its excellent stability. Post-stability XRD (Figure S15) and SEM (Figure S16) analyses reveal that the phase structure and morphology of D-Co/CC remain essentially unchanged, underscoring its robust structural integrity. These results highlight the excellent HzOR activity and durability of D-Co/CC. To gain a deeper understanding of these properties, the following sections focus on the

underlying catalytic mechanism and origin of this superior performance.

#### Mechanistic Insights into Cobalt-Catalyzed HzOR

To elucidate the origin of the remarkable HzOR performance of D-Co/CC, we systematically investigated the reaction mechanism. The oxidation of hydrazine may proceed through direct and mediated pathways. For the direct electrooxidation pathway, previous reports have identified metallic cobalt as the active phase, [30,35,36] and our experiments also confirm that cobalt hydroxide synthesized through a hydrothermal method (denoted as H-Co(OH)<sub>2</sub>/CC) exhibits negligible HzOR activity (Figure S17). These findings support that direct hydrazine oxidation occurs on metallic Co sites rather than on high-valent cobalt species, as illustrated in Path 1 of Figure 3a. The mediated pathway contains the electrooxidation of Co(0) to Co(II) and the redox reaction between hydrazine and

Co(II), as shown in Path 2 of Figure 3a. The Co(OH) $_2$ /Co equilibrium potential ( $\sim$ 0.08 V), higher than HzOR equilibrium potential ( $\sim$ 0.08 V) and within the experimental potential range, ensures the thermodynamic feasibility of this mediated pathway. [20,37] Overall, these analyses suggest that the hydrazine oxidation on cobalt catalysts follows a dual-pathway mechanism, involving both direct oxidation on metallic Co and mediated oxidation through Co(II)/Co(0) redox cycling, as summarized in Figure 3a.

A chronoamperometry test was performed on D-Co/CC at 0.25 V in 1.0 M KOH to validate the proposed dual-pathway mechanism (Figure 3b). The current exhibits an initial anodic response that gradually declined to near zero, indicating the complete oxidation of D-Co/CC, and the catalyst in oxidized state is denoted as D-Co(OH)<sub>2</sub>/CC. Upon the injection of 0.1 M N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> at 100 s, a pronounced increase in anodic current was observed, confirming that Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> can chemically react with hydrazine to regenerate metallic cobalt, even under applied oxidative potential. This finding provides evidence for

the mediated oxidation pathway during HzOR. Additionally, if the reaction was governed solely by the mediated pathway, the current would stabilize immediately after hydrazine introduction. Instead, the experimentally observed progressive current increase implies the growing involvement of direct oxidation as the regeneration of metallic Co. These results strongly support a dual-pathway mechanism involving both direct and mediated oxidation on cobalt catalysts.

Lowering the hydrazine concentration allowed clearer differentiation between the two pathways by suppressing the reaction rate. Therefore, cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed on D-Co/CC in 1.0 M KOH with 0–40 mM N2H4 (Figure 3c). All CV data were collected after five initial scans at 5 mV s−<sup>1</sup> to ensure surface stabilization (Figure S18). In blank 1.0 M KOH, the CV curve exhibits an anodic peak due to the surface oxidation of Co(0) to Co(II) in this potential region. Upon adding N2H4, the oxidation peak grows larger, and a current plateau emerges at high potentials, attributable to hydrazine oxidation. In the proposed dual-pathway model, the direct oxidation current catalyzed by Co(0) increases exponentially with potential, assuming stable surface conditions. Meanwhile, the mediated pathway contains a nonelectrochemical reaction between hydrazine and Co(II), which is potential-independent. As potential rises, surface Co(0) is oxidized faster than it can be regenerated by hydrazine, gradually reducing the contribution of the direct pathway. This transition is reflected by the current peak. When metallic Co is fully consumed, only the mediated pathway remains active, with the chemical redox reaction as the rate-determining step, leading to a steady-state current plateau.

Figure 3c reveals a concentration-dependent increase in current over the full potential range, which can also be well explained by the dual-pathway mechanism. Based on the second equation of Path 2 in Figure 3a, which describes the redox reaction between hydrazine and Co(II), the plateau current density *j*plateau is given by Equation (1), derived from the classical EC' (electrochemical–chemical) mechanism[\[38](#page-11-0)] :

$$r = kc^{\alpha} \left( N_2 H_4 \right) = \frac{j_{\text{plateau}}}{nF} \tag{1}$$

where *r* is the surface-normalized reaction rate of hydrazine/Co(II) redox reaction, *k* is the rate constant, *c*(N2H4) is the concentration of N2H4, α is the reaction order, *n* is the electron transfer number, and *F* is the Faraday

constant. The plateau current densities extracted from Figure [3c](#page-5-0) are fitted as a function of *c*(N2H4) (Figure S19), suggesting an approximate first-order reaction behavior and further supporting the mediated pathway as the origin of the plateau current. Moreover, increasing *c*(N2H4) also leads to higher peak currents and the positive shifts in peak potentials. This can be attributed to the accelerated Co(0) regeneration prolonging the direct pathway contribution and delaying the decline in catalyst activity. These findings suggest that a fast redox reaction between hydrazine and Co(II) is favorable to both direct and mediated pathways, thereby enhancing overall HzOR performance.

Based on the dual-pathway mechanism, Co(OH)2 catalysts should in principle enable HzOR via the mediated route. However, as previously noted, the H-Co(OH)2 we synthesized by a conventional hydrothermal method is nearly inactive (Figure S17). This can be explained by its poor redox reactivity with hydrazine. The slow Co(II) reduction not only limits the mediated process but also fails to generate enough Co(0) for direct oxidation. To verify this hypothesis, H-Co(OH)2 was immersed in 0.1 M N2H4 for extended periods (30, 60, and 90 min). The resulting 30 min-H-Co(OH)2/CC, 60 min-H-Co(OH)2/CC, and 90 min-H-Co(OH)2/CC samples exhibit progressively stronger direct oxidation currents in 1.0 M KOH + 0.1 M N2H4 electrolyte (Figure [3d\)](#page-5-0), indicating the slow but feasible reduction of Co(II). Moreover, despite the prolonged immersion, the plateau current density remains low (∼4 mA cm−2), comparable to that of D-Co/CC at just one-tenth the hydrazine concentration, further demonstrating the low Co(II) reduction rate. As a result, the HzOR current drops markedly in subsequent scans (Figure S20), revealing the essential role of rapid hydrazine/Co(II) redox kinetics in maintaining catalytic activity. At low potentials below the Co(0)/Co(II) equilibrium, where the direct oxidation pathway dominates, the insufficient recovery of Co(0) after highpotential operation results in a shortage of active sites, thus leading to poor catalytic performance. These behaviors, in contrast to D-Co/CC, also highlight the importance of the catalyst's intrinsic properties in regulating the hydrazine/Co(II) redox process and the HzOR performance. To understand the structure–activity relationship, we next investigate the structural origins of the enhanced hydrazine oxidation activity on D-Co/CC.

#### *Origin of High HzOR Activity in D-Co/CC*

As previous studies have primarily focused on enhancing the direct oxidation of hydrazine, most structural strategies aim to improve the catalyst's intrinsic activity toward this pathway. Our Tafel slope and EIS analyses in Figure [2b,c,](#page-4-0) conducted in the potential region where the direct pathway dominates, also support this enhancement in D-Co/CC. Nevertheless, considering the importance of the hydrazine/Co(II) redox step revealed in our mechanistic analysis, it is also essential to identify the structural features that can facilitate this critical process. Literature reports suggest that defect-rich Co(OH)2 is more readily reduced to metallic Co compared to its defectfree counterpart.[\[39\]](#page-11-0) The slower reduction kinetics observed for H-Co(OH)2/CC in our study may be attributed to its lower defect density and more ordered local coordination structure, which limit the accessibility of coordinatively unsaturated sites for hydrazine-induced redox reactions. Furthermore, a Co(OH)2/CC catalyst prepared by electrodeposition (E-Co(OH)2/CC) exhibits a higher oxygen vacancy concentration than H-Co(OH)2/CC (O 1s XPS spectra, Figure S21) and superior HzOR activity (Figure S22), further suggesting the importance of defects in Co-based HzOR catalysts. Building on this, we propose that the defective structure of D-Co/CC facilitates the fast regeneration of metallic Co, thereby contributing to its exceptional HzOR performance. This hypothesis is examined through a combination of structural characterization, electrochemical analysis, and theoretical calculation.

To probe the structural evolution and redox behavior, D-Co/CC and Co/CC were subjected to prolonged cyclic voltammetry (CV) oxidation in 1.0 M KOH to obtain D-Co(OH)2/CC and Co(OH)2/CC, respectively (Figure S23). XPS was employed to determine their valence states and compositions. As shown in the Co 2p XPS spectra (Figure S24), both D-Co(OH)2/CC and Co(OH)2/CC exhibit only Co(II) signals, with no detectable Co(0), confirming complete surface oxidation. In the O 1s spectra (Figure [4a\)](#page-7-0), the deconvoluted peaks at 530.0, 531.3, and 532.4 eV are attributed to lattice oxygen, surface oxygen species, and oxygen vacancies (OV), respectively.[\[40,41\]](#page-11-0) D-Co(OH)2/CC exhibits a higher concentration of oxygen vacancies compared to Co(OH)2/CC, suggesting its defective structure even after oxidation. XANES and EXAFS analyses were further conducted to gain detailed insights into the valence state and coordination environment. As shown in Figure [4b,](#page-7-0) both D-Co(OH)2/CC and Co(OH)2/CC exhibit average valence states lower than that of CoO, indicating the largely unchanged bulk lattice during surface oxidation. In the Fourier-transformed EXAFS spectra (Figure [4c\)](#page-7-0), two prominent peaks at approximately 1.5 and 2.1 Å correspond to the Co─O and Co─Co bonds, respectively. Remarkably, the peak intensities for D-Co(OH)2/CC are substantially weaker compared to those of Co(OH)2/CC, indicative of a higher density of oxygen and cobalt vacancies, implying that D-Co/CC remains rich in defects throughout the catalytic cycle.

Given the defect-rich nature of D-Co/CC after oxidation, its role in facilitating the hydrazine-induced redox process is thereafter examined. To assess the kinetics of hydrazineinduced reduction, open-circuit potential (OCP) measurements were performed. Variations in the catalyst valence state alter the interfacial composition at the electrodeelectrolyte boundary, thus shifting the equilibrium potential, which can be tracked by monitoring OCP changes.[\[42\]](#page-11-0) After introducing 0.1 M N2H4 in 1.0 M KOH, D-Co(OH)2/CC exhibits a rapid and pronounced OCP shift of 0.28 V within 30 s, while Co(OH)2/CC shows a smaller shift of 0.17 V over the same period (Figure [4d\)](#page-7-0), highlighting the faster spontaneous reduction kinetics of D-Co(OH)2/CC. This faster reduction of defective catalysts is also reflected in the electrochemical reactivation test shown earlier in Figure [3b,](#page-5-0) where D-Co(OH)2/CC rapidly regains its activity within ∼350 s after N2H4 addition.

same condition, it requires a substantially longer duration of  $\sim\!1200$  s to reach a steady current (Figure S25), reinforcing a faster regeneration of Co(0) on the defect-rich catalyst. Moreover, D-Co(OH)\_2/CC and Co(OH)\_2/CC were immersed in 0.1 M N\_2H\_4 solution for 2 min, followed by XPS analysis (Figure S26). A clear Co(0) signal appears in the spectrum of D-Co(OH)\_2/CC-2 min, while no detectable Co(0) species are observed in Co(OH)\_2/CC-2 min. Together with HRTEM images showing the disappearance of Co(OH)\_2 (111) fringes (0.46 nm) and the emergence of Co (111) fringes (0.21 nm) in D-Co(OH)\_2/CC-2 min (Figure S27), these results provide direct evidence of more efficient hydrazine-induced reduction on the defect-rich catalyst.

In situ Raman spectroscopy was then employed to track the valence state evolution of the catalysts during electrocatalysis. In 1.0 M KOH + 20 mM  $N_2H_4$ , both D-Co/CC and Co/CC exhibited negligible Raman signals at OCP, consistent with the Raman-inactive nature of Co(0). Upon increasing the potential, a broad band at ~495 cm<sup>-1</sup>, characteristic of Co(OH)<sub>2</sub>, emerged at ~0.4 V for D-Co/CC (Figure 4e) but appeared at ~0 V for Co/CC (Figure 4f), indicating that the promoted hydrazine-induced regeneration of Co(0) in D-Co/CC delays its oxidation to Co(II). After holding at 0.8 V, the potential was removed and spectra were recorded every 5 min. The Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> band of D-Co/CC disappeared within 10 min, whereas Co/CC still displayed this feature even after 30 min, confirming the faster redox kinetics of D-Co(OH)<sub>2</sub>/CC.

To further quantify the kinetic advantage of defect-rich structures during the hydrazine/Co(II) redox process, we calculated the apparent rate constants (k) for both D-Co/CC and Co/CC catalysts at different temperatures using Equation (1). The electrochemical measurements were performed in water baths at 25, 35, and 45 °C, with corresponding measured temperatures of 25.9, 34.6, and 43.0 °C (Figure \$28). To obtain reliable values of  $j_{plateau}$ , a series of CV curves at varying temperatures and hydrazine concentrations were recorded (Figures \$29 and \$30), from which the steady-state current densities were extracted. The resulting rate constants are shown in Figure S31 for D-Co/CC and Co/CC, respectively. Arrhenius plots of ln(k) versus 1000/T yield good linear relationships for both catalysts (Figure 4g). According to the fitting results, D-Co/CC displays a lower activation energy of 22.9 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>, in contrast to 49.6 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup> for Co/CC, confirming that defect engineering substantially reduces the energy barrier for the hydrazine-induced reduction of Co(II). These findings provide direct kinetic support for the critical role of defects in accelerating redox regeneration of metallic Co, which promotes both direct and mediated HzOR pathways.

The impact of the experimentally evidenced fast Co(0) regeneration on catalytic stability was then examined. After CV tests performed in 1.0 M KOH + 20 mM N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> (Figure S32), D-Co/CC maintains nearly constant activity across cycles, with only a slight decrease after the first scan. In contrast, Co/CC displays a progressive decline in activity with each cycle, in line with its slower ability to regenerate active metallic Co during HzOR. Consistent with this, D-Co/CC also retains high activity after deliberate over-oxidation. As shown in Figure 4h, its LSV curve in 1.0 M KOH + 0.1 M

 $N_2H_4$  before and after CV oxidation in 1.0 M KOH remains nearly unchanged. By comparison, Co/CC suffers a significant activity loss under the same conditions (Figure 4i), consistent with previous reports. This exceptional stability of D-Co/CC is ascribed to its high density of structural defects, which facilitate the regeneration of Co(0) by hydrazine and effectively preserve active sites for the direct pathway of HzOR. This regeneration process is particularly important, as metallic Co tends to be oxidized upon air exposure, as evidenced by XPS (Figure S4), as well as under potential fluctuations during start—stop operations and extended anodic polarization. The rapid regeneration of Co(0) by hydrazine is thus essential to sustain the direct HzOR pathway and ensure long-term catalytic activity.

To summarize the above findings, Figure 4j presents a schematic illustration highlighting the critical role of defects in enabling rapid reduction of oxidized Co sites. In accordance with the dual-pathway mechanism, the hydrazine/Co(II) redox process plays a dual role in HzOR: it regenerates Co(0) as the active site in the direct pathway at low potentials and serves as the rate-limiting step in the mediated pathway at high potentials. Structural defects in D-Co/CC significantly accelerate this step, thereby enabling high activity and long-term operational stability across a wide potential window.

DFT calculations were carried out to support the experimental findings and elucidate the origin of the superior dual-pathway activity of D-Co/CC in the HzOR. Four models were constructed: cobalt with two vacancies (D-Co), pristine cobalt (Co), cobalt hydroxide with two Co vacancies and one O vacancy (D-Co(OH)<sub>2</sub>), and stoichiometric  $Co(OH)_2$ . The optimized structures are shown in Figure 5a. To investigate the kinetics of the key hydrazine/Co(II) redox reaction, the activation energy for the reaction between the oxidized catalyst and hydrazine  $(2Co(OH)_2 + N_2H_4 \rightarrow 2Co + 4H_2O)$ was calculated based on the reaction pathway illustrated in Figure 5b, with the transition-state structure depicted in Figure S33. As presented in Figure 5c, D-Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> exhibits a significantly more negative adsorption free energy for N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> (-0.20 eV) than  $Co(OH)_2$  (0.12 eV), suggesting stronger hydrazine adsorption and favorable thermodynamics for subsequent steps. A stepwise dehydrogenation mechanism of hydrazine was then modeled, including interactions between intermediates and surface hydroxyls. On Co(OH)2, the ratedetermining step (RDS) requires an energy barrier of 1.32 eV, which decreases to 1.11 eV on D-Co(OH)2, indicating that defects significantly accelerate the nonelectrochemical redox kinetics. These results are consistent with experimental observations and suggest that defect introduction lowers the energy barrier for hydrazine-induced reduction of oxidized cobalt species. To further understand the adsorption behavior of intermediates, density of states (DOS) and d-band center  $(E_{\rm d})$  analyses were performed. As shown in Figure 5d, the  $E_{\rm d}$ of D-Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> is located at -0.41 eV, notably higher than that of  $Co(OH)_2$  (-0.97 eV), consistent with stronger binding of intermediates on the defective surface.

Gibbs free energy diagrams were also constructed to compare the direct-pathway HzOR energetics on all four models (Figure 5e). For D-Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> and Co(OH)<sub>2</sub>, the RDS corresponds to the dehydrogenation from  $*N_2H_4$  to  $*N_2H_3$ ,

with *G* values of 0.71 and 0.67 eV, respectively. In contrast, the RDS on metallic Co and D-Co involves the desorption of \*N2 to N2, with lower barriers of 0.43 and 0.39 eV, respectively. These results corroborate the experimentally supported conclusion that metallic Co serves as the active site for direct HzOR. Notably, D-Co exhibits the lowest energy barrier, indicating that defect engineering modulates the electronic structure of Co and enhances the thermodynamics of the HzOR dehydrogenation steps. Overall, these results demonstrate that defect introduction not only promotes the nonelectrochemical reduction of oxidized cobalt species but also improves the intrinsic catalytic activity of metallic Co, offering a mechanistic basis for the enhanced dual-pathway performance of D-Co/CC. Coupled with experimental evidence, these findings identify structural defects as the primary origin of the remarkable HzOR behavior of D-Co/CC.

#### *Hydrazine-Assisted Hydrogen Production Performance*

Considering the excellent electrocatalytic performance of D-Co/CC for HzOR, an H-type two-compartment electrolyzer was assembled using D-Co/CC as the anode and commercial Pt/C as the cathode catalyst for overall hydrazine splitting (OHzS). The electrolyzer employs 1.0 M KOH + 0.5 M N2H4 as the anolyte and 1.0 M KOH as the catholyte, separated by a cation-exchange membrane to effectively prevent N2H4 crossover and enable high-purity H2 collection at the cathode. Impressively, the D-Co/CC-based OHzS electrolyzer delivers ultralow cell voltages of 0.022, 0.093, and 0.189 V at current densities of 50, 100, and 200 mA cm−2, respectively (Figure [6a\)](#page-10-0). Such low voltages far outperform those of the Pt-based OHzS system (0.42, 0.61, and 0.80 V). Moreover, in comparison with a wide range of reported OHzS electrocatalysts, D-Co/CC achieves substantially reduced cell voltage at 100 mA cm−<sup>2</sup> (Figure [6b\)](#page-10-0), placing it among the most efficient non-noble metal catalysts currently available for hydrazine-assisted hydrogen production. Additionally, the conventional overall water splitting (OWS) electrolyzer with RuO2 and Pt/C catalysts requires significantly higher voltages of 2.049, 2.201, and 2.498 V to achieve 50, 100, and 200 mA cm−2, respectively, highlighting the thermodynamic advantage of hydrazine-assisted hydrogen generation. To assess the practical benefits of the hydrazine-assisted hydrogen production system, we calculated the electricity consumption and economic gain based on the LSV data. As shown in Figure S34, the D-Co/CC-driven system requires only 0.41 kWh m−<sup>3</sup> H2 at 200 mA cm−2, achieving an overall economic gain of USD ∼1.83 m−<sup>3</sup> H2 compared with conventional alkaline water electrolysis.[\[43\]](#page-11-0)

The volumes of generated N2 and H2 were quantified using a standard water displacement method (Figure S35).

The N<sub>2</sub>/H<sub>2</sub> volume ratio at all measured time points closely matches the theoretical value of 1:2, and the calculated Faradaic efficiencies for both the anode and cathode approach 100% (Figure 6c). The slightly elevated anodic Faradaic efficiency may result from spontaneous hydrazine decomposition, which produces additional N<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub> beyond the electrochemical contribution. Gas chromatography analysis further confirms that the anodic gas consists predominantly of  $N_2$ , with only a small amount of  $H_2$  detected (Figure S36), excluding the occurrence of other side reactions at the anode, such as ammonia or nitrogen oxide formation. The long-term durability of the OHzS system is confirmed by a chronoamperometric test at 100 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, showing only an 8% decrease in current density after continuous operation for over 65 h (Figure 6d). To demonstrate the practical applicability of the system, the electrolyzer was powered by a commercial solar cell under simulated sunlight using a xenon lamp (Figure 6e). Vigorous bubble formation at both the cathode and anode confirms that D-Co/CC can efficiently drive hydrogen production at low voltages, underscoring its strong potential for real-world applications.

#### Conclusion

This study provides a comprehensive mechanistic understanding of hydrazine oxidation over cobalt-based electrocatalysts, uncovering the coexistence of direct and mediated pathways. Notably, we identify the chemical redox reaction between hydrazine and Co(II) as a previously overlooked but essential process that governs both the regeneration of metallic Co active sites for direct oxidation and the operation of mediated oxidation. This insight enables a new direction for catalyst optimization beyond the prevailing focus on solely enhancing

the intrinsic activity of metallic Co sites. As a validation, we synthesized a D-Co/CC catalyst with defect-rich cobalt surfaces, which facilitates the hydrazine/Co(II) redox reaction while simultaneously improving the direct oxidation kinetics. Consequently, D-Co/CC exhibits benchmark hydrazine oxidation performance, delivering a current density of 100 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> at only -79 mV, maintaining this performance for over 150 h, and driving hydrazine-assisted hydrogen production at a remarkably low cell voltage of 93 mV when paired with Pt/C. These findings move beyond conventional performance optimization and establish a mechanistic framework for rational catalyst design. Looking forward, this dualpathway model offers a conceptual basis for exploring other small-molecule electrooxidation reactions and may inspire broader applications in energy-saving hydrogen production and wastewater remediation.

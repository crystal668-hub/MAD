# **Electrocatalysis Using Cobalt Porphyrin Covalently Linked with Multi-Walled Carbon Nanotubes: Hydrazine Sensing and Hydrazine-Assisted Green Hydrogen Synthesis**

*Mohammad Tasleem, Varsha Singh, Ananya Tiwari, Vellaichamy Ganesan,\* and Muniappan Sankar\**

**Acid-treated multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) covalently functionalized with cobalt triphenothiazine porphyrin (CoTriPTZ-OH) A3B type porphyrin, containing three phenothiazine moieties (represented as MWCNT-CoTriPTZ) is synthesized and characterized by various spectroscopic and microscopic techniques. The nanoconjugate, MWCNT-CoTriPTZ, exhibits a pair of distinct redox peaks due to the Co2<sup>+</sup>/Co3<sup>+</sup> redox process in 0.1 M pH 7.0 phosphate buffer. Further, it electrocatalytically oxidizes hydrazine at a low overpotential with a high current. This property is advantageously utilized for the sensitive determination of hydrazine. The developed electrochemical sensor exhibits high sensitivity (0.99 μAμM<sup>−</sup>1cm<sup>−</sup>2), a low limit of detection (4.5 ppb), and a broad linear calibration range (0.1 μM to 3.0 mM) for the determination of hydrazine. Further, MWCNT-CoTriPTZ is exploited for hydrazine-assisted green hydrogen synthesis. The high efficiency of hydrazine oxidation is confirmed by the low onset potential (0.45 V (vs RHE)) and 0.60 V (vs RHE) at the current density of 10 mA.cm<sup>−</sup>2. MWCNT-CoTriPTZ displays a high current density (77.29 mA.cm<sup>−</sup>2) at 1.45 V (vs RHE).**

of global warming.[\[1\]](#page-11-0) These problems have urged researchers to find alternative clean and sustainable energy sources. In this regard, fuel cells have emerged as a promising option. Accordingly, molecules like urea,[\[2\]](#page-11-0) methanol,[\[3\]](#page-11-0) ethanol,[\[3\]](#page-11-0) hydrazine,[\[4\]](#page-11-0) etc. are being considered as the fuel applicants. In this context, hydrazine has been applied in direct hydrazine fuel cells owing to its remarkable properties viz., easy to store, no harmful emission on electro-oxidation, and no electrode poisoning.[\[5\]](#page-11-0) Interestingly, the electro-oxidation of hydrazine occurs at a much lower voltage than water oxidation making hydrazine as the key to producing hydrogen at lower potentials when the two reactions (oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrazine oxidation) are combined.[\[6\]](#page-11-0) The combination of OER and hydrazine oxidation produces a substantial amount of H<sup>+</sup> at low potentials, which can be utilized at the cathode side of fuel cells to produce electricity.[\[6\]](#page-11-0) When compared

to other fuel candidates like ethanol and methanol, hydrazine produces N2 as the by-product, which is environmentally benign and, at the same time, has faster kinetics also.[\[6,7\]](#page-11-0) Hydrazineassisted water splitting has been reported by many groups with different catalysts.[\[8\]](#page-11-0) For example, Zhang et al. studied the oxidation of hydrazine using cobalt perselenide nanosheets,[\[9\]](#page-11-0) Wang et al.[\[10\]](#page-11-0) exploited NiS2 nanosheets for efficient hydrazine oxidation, Liu et al.[\[7\]](#page-11-0) sulfurized the Cu-Ni-Co nanosheets for hydrazineassisted hydrogen production. Subrahmanyam and his co-worker have synthesized heterostructure between carbon nitride and Co3O4 and through chronoamperometry sense to hydrazine with high sensitively (819.52 μA mM<sup>−</sup>1) and low limit of detection (3.14 μM).[\[11\]](#page-11-0)

On the other hand, hydrazine is one of the prominent pollutants as hydrazine and its derivatives are accumulated in water sources because of their extensive use in various industries.[\[12–18\]](#page-11-0) Though hydrazine is not highly fatal, prolonged consumption of low levels of hydrazine causes multiple health issues in human beings like irreparable depreciation of the nervous system, and abnormalities of the brain, liver, and blood.[\[14,16,18\]](#page-11-0) Accordingly, the United States Environmental Protection Agency classified it as a pollutant and recommended 10 ppb as the permissible concentration. Therefore, sensing of hydrazine present in

water sources to such a very low amount (ppb levels) becomes essential. Atta et al. have synthesized an electrochemical sensor using carbon nanotubes, Nafion, 15-crown-5, and gold nanoparticles and amperometrically sense to hydrazine in wastewater with a detection limit (0.132 nM).[\[19\]](#page-11-0) Various types of materials such as modified poly(dicyandiamide),[\[20\]](#page-11-0) selenium nanoparticle deposited graphitic electrode,[\[21\]](#page-11-0) graphene oxide and PDOT:PSS composite[\[22\]](#page-11-0) and pyrroloquinoline quinone functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT)[\[23\]](#page-11-0) have been used for hydrazine detection.

To realize the oxidation of hydrazine, a variety of porphyrins are used as efficient electrocatalysts. Some monomer pushpull porphyrins have been used in dye-sensitized solar cells.[\[24\]](#page-11-0) fused porphyrins polymeric layers are used as electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER)[\[25\]](#page-11-0) and a porphyrinimmobilized MWCNT matrix is used as a catalyst for the hydrogenases.[\[26\]](#page-11-0) In this work, electrochemical sensing of hydrazine and hydrazine-assisted hydrogen production have been studied using MWCNT covalently functionalized with cobalt triphenothiazine porphyrin (CoTriPTZ-OH) via ester coupling, containing three electron-rich phenothiazine moieties (represented as MWCNT-CoTriPTZ, for the structure, refer **Scheme 1**) in 0.1 M pH 7.0 phosphate buffer. The MWCNT-CoTriPTZ nanoconjugate shows efficient catalytic activity towards the hydrazine oxidation and superior properties for the determination of hydrazine compared to the individual counterparts, MWCNT- COOH and CoTriPTZ-OH and many other related materials. The presence of MWCNT is expected to enhance the electron transfer rate and electrochemically active surface area. CoTriPTZ-OH moiety may facilitate the oxidation of hydrazine at a very low potential.

# **2.3. Synthesis of 5-(4′-Hydroxyphenyl)−10,15,20-tris(10-butyl-3-phenothiazine) porphyrin (TriPTZ-OH)**

The experimental procedure of formylated phenothiazine (PTZ-CHO) has been given in Scheme S1 (Supporting Information). The synthetic scheme to synthesize CoTriPTZ-OH has been shown in Scheme S2 (Supporting Information). Formylated phenothiazine (PTZ-CHO) (1000 mg, 3.53 mmol), 4 hydroxybenzaldehyde (144 mg, 1.17 mmol), and pyrrole (32 mL, 4.72 mmol) were dissolved in dry CHCl3 and purged with Ar gas for 30 min. followed by the addition of 0.1 mL boron trifluoride etherate to the reaction mixture and stirring for 3 h in the dark. After that, 2.5 equivalent of *p*-chloranil was added and stirred overnight. After completion of the reaction, the solvent was evaporated by vacuum, and the desired porphyrin was purified by silica gel column CHCl3 as solvent. The 1H-NMR spectrum of TriPTZ-OH has been shown in Figure S3 (Supporting Information). Yield: 5% (250 mg, 0.215 mmol), UV/vis. (CHCl3): max (nm): 424, 524, 563, 597, 653. 1H NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3) (ppm): 7.98 (s, 8H, -H), 8.83-8.02 (d, 4-H, *meso*-*o*-*Ph*-H), 7.97-6.98 (m, 21H, phenothiazine), 4.10-4.07 (t, 6H, -CH2-H), 2.05-1.99 (m, 6H, -CH2-H), 1.65-1.58 (m, 6H, -CH2-H), 1.08-1.05 (t, 9H, -CH3-H).

# **2.5. Synthesis of Nanoconjugate (MWCNT-CoTriPTZ) of CoTriPTZ-OH and Acid-Functionalized MWCNT[\[28,29\]](#page-11-0)**

MWCNT-COOH (100 mg) and 70 mg of N, Ndicyclohexylcarbidiimide (DCC) were mixed with 15 mL DMF and sonicated for 15 min.[\[30\]](#page-11-0) To activate the carboxylic group the above reaction mixture was refluxed for 24 h. After that, 30 mg (0.024 mmol) of CoTriPTZ-OH and 3 mg (0.024 mmol) of 4-dimethylaminipyridyne (DMAP) were added and left the reaction mixture on a stirrer for 72 h at room temperature. After the completion of ester coupling, the reaction mixture was centrifuged and washed with CHCl3 and DMF to remove any unreacted precursors. The synthesized MWCNT-CoTriPTZ nanoconjugate was dried in a vacuum oven for 6 h. The synthetic methodology has been shown in Scheme [1.](#page-1-0)

#### **2.6. Fabrication of Working Electrode**

Electrochemical studies were done using glassy carbon electrodes (GCEs) of a geometrical surface area of 0.071 cm2. The GCEs were cleaned prior to the electrochemical studies by wiping with ethanol, polishing on a wet Buehler-felt pad with 0.05 micron alumina powder, washing with triple distilled water, and finally sonicating for 2 min in an ultrasonic cleaner. After the sonication, the GCE was washed again with triple distilled water and left to dry in the air. A suspension of 1% or 0.1% of the respective materials (MWCNT-COOH, CoTriPTZ-OH, and MWCNT-CoTriPTZ nanoconjugate) was prepared in DMF by sonicating for 30 min. To explore the electrochemistry of the materials and for the electrochemical sensing studies, 10 μL of 0.1% suspension was coated on the clean and dry GCE and used after air drying. The resulting electrodes were abbreviated as MWCNT-COOH-ESP, CoTriPTZ-OH-ESP, and MWCNT-CoTriPTZ-ESP, where ESP stands for the electrochemical sensing platform. For hydrazine-assisted hydrogen production studies, 5 μL of 1% suspension was coated and allowed to dry. These electrodes were referred to as GCE/MWCNT-COOH, GCE/CoTriPTZ-OH, and GCE/MWCNT-CoTriPTZ. Nitrogen gas was purged for 15 min through the supporting electrolyte solution prior to the electrochemical studies related to sensing. Reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) potentials were calculated based on the observed potentials using equation (1).

# **3. Results and Discussion**

# **3.1. UV–vis Absorption Spectroscopy**

To confirm the conjugation of CoTriPTZ-OH on MWCNT-COOH through ester coupling, the UV-vis absorption spectrum

<span id="page-3-0"></span>**Figure 1.** a) The UV–vis. absorption spectra, b) The FT-IR spectra, c) Thermogravimetric analysis and d) The X-rays diffraction pattern of CoTriPTZ-OH, MWCNT-CoTriPTZ, and MWCNT-COOH.

was recorded. The Soret band of CoTriPTZ-OH is observed at 430 nm and the Q-bands are found at 537 and 602 nm in DMF. The absorption spectra of the MWCNT-CoTriPTZ, CoTriPTZ-OH, and MWCNT-COOH were compared in DMF and found that the Soret band of nanoconjugate is broadened and redshifted by 9 nm due to the covalent immobilization of CoTri PTZ-OH porphyrin on MWCNT-COOH. As expected, the noncovalently functionalized porphyrin on MWCNT does not show any shift in the Soret band.[[31\]](#page-11-0) The absorption intensity of porphyrin is suppressed when it is conjugated with MWCNT due to electron transfer from porphyrin to MWCNT as shown in **Figure 1**a. [\[32\]](#page-11-0)

#### **3.2. FTIR Spectroscopy**

To confirm the conjugation between CoTriPTZ-OH porphyrin and acid-treated MWCNT, the FTIR spectrum has been recorded. The peak observed at 3433 cm<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> is due to the stretching vibration of the OH group present due to atmospheric moisture. The C-H asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrational peaks are present at 2955 and 2862 cm<sup>−</sup>1. The presence of another peak in CoTriPTZ-OH at 1591 cm<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> (C = C), 1457 cm<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> (C = N), 1352 cm<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> (C-N), 1248 cm<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> (C-OH), and 1002 cm<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> (Co-N) gives the evidence of porphyrin skeleton.[\[33\]](#page-11-0) In Figure 1b, the MWCNT-COOH shows carbonyl peaks (C = O) at 1805 cm<sup>−</sup>1, while this peak in MWCNT-CoTriPTZ-OH shifted to 1791 cm<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> due to carboxylate ion.[\[34–36\]](#page-11-0) The peak observed around 1630 cm<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> and 1387 cm<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> in MWCNT-COOH is assigned to the C = C stretching and C-C bending in the carbon nanotube skeleton.[\[37\]](#page-11-0) The peak observed around 1383 cm<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> in MWCNT-CoTriPTZ-OH is attributed to the C-C/C-N group due to porphyrin immobilization.

#### **3.3. Thermo Gravimetric Analysis (TGA)**

To know the temperature stability of materials and the degree of conjugation of porphyrin on the MWCNT-COOH, thermogravimetric analysis has been performed in the N2 atmosphere. Figure 1c depicts that the weight loss observed in MWCNT-CoTriPTZ nanoconjugate as compared to MWCNT-COOH is mainly due to the conjugation of CoTriPTZ-OH porphyrin on MWCNT-COOH and nanoconjugate is more stable than the free porphyrin. From Figure 1c, it can be seen that 60% weight loss occurs in the temperature range of 150−600 °C for porphyrin while only 6% weight loss occurs for nanoconjugate in the same temperature range.[\[38\]](#page-11-0) At 600 °C, only 2% weight loss occurs in the oxidized MWCNT-COOH, whereas 7% and 63% weight loss are observed for MWCNT-CoTriPTZ and CoTriPTZ-OH porphyrin, respectively. Taking MWCNT-COOH weight loss as the reference, the weight loss in nanoconjugate after functionalization of CoTriPTZ-OH porphyrin is found to be 5%. The number of porphyrin molecules functionalized on MWCNT-COOH; the ratio of porphyrin weight loss is found to be 8% (5% / 63%). **[www.advancedsciencenews.com](http://www.advancedsciencenews.com) [www.small-journal.com](http://www.small-journal.com)**

See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License

Accordingly, the number of carbon atoms per porphyrin molecule was calculated as 1167 [(92%×1218)/(8%×12)].[\[38–41\]](#page-11-0)

#### **3.4. X-Ray Diffraction Analysis**

To know the crystalline nature of synthesized materials, the XRD analysis has been recorded for MWCNT-COOH, MWCNT-CoTriPTZ, nanoconjugate, and CoTriPTZ-OH porphyrin shown in Figure [1d.](#page-3-0) The XRD graph of pristine MWCNT−COOH shows two main characteristic diffraction peaks at 2 of 25.8° and 43° correspond to miller indices (002) and (100) for graphitic planes of MWCNT-COOH. After the conjugation of MWCNT-COOH with CoTriPTZ-OH porphyrin, the intensity of the (002) peak decreased and the peak position shifted toward a higher diffraction angle as compared to pristine MWCNT-COOH.[\[42–45\]](#page-11-0) In MWCNT-CoTriPTZ, all the peaks of CoTriPTZ-OH porphyrin remain the same and prove the interaction between MWCNT-COOH and CoTriPTZ-OH.[\[46\]](#page-11-0)

#### **3.5. Electron Microscopy Analysis**

The TEM and SEM are utilized to investigate surface morphology such as the size, shape, and structure of prepared materials (in **Figure [2](#page-5-0)**). The TEM images of bare MWCNT-COOH at various resolution scales have been shown in Figure [2a,a-1–a-3.](#page-5-0) The TEM images of bare MWCNT look smooth, regular, and clean with no sign of an extra adsorbent *i.e* porphyrin molecule on the surface of bare MWCNT while TEM images of nanoconjugates MWCNT-CoTriPTZ in Figure [2b–b-6](#page-5-0) show the presence of some black spot on the surface of MWCNT. It is due to the adsorption of porphyrin molecules on MWCNT. The black spot in an image (b-2) looks bright in the dark field image (b-3). The HR-TEM images of nanoconjugate in Figure [2b-4,b-5](#page-5-0) also confirm the same.[\[47,48\]](#page-11-0) Figure 2b-5′ to b-5′″ are FFT (fast Fourier transform) diffraction patterns, FFT mask, and line profiles of HRTEM images while Figure [\(2b-6\)](#page-5-0) is inverse FFT (IFFT) images due to porphyrins.

The surface morphology, texture, and elemental composition of materials are determined by SEM technique. In Figure [2c,](#page-5-0) the SEM image of MWCNT-COOH looks uniform with the EDAX spectrum (Figure [2c-1\)](#page-5-0) confirming the presence of C and O as a compositional element having appropriate percentages. Figure [2c-4](#page-5-0) shows elemental mapping which confirms the uniform distribution of elements. Similarly, Figure [2d](#page-5-0) shows an SEM image of nanoconjugates with increased surface roughness and elements due to the functionalization of CoTriPTZ-OH porphyrin on MWCNT-COOH. The EDAX spectrum of MWCNT-CoTriPTZ (Figure [2d-1\)](#page-5-0) also shows the presence of two extra elements N and Co in addition to the C and O with appropriate elemental composition. The elemental mapping of nanoconjugate in Figure [2d-2–d-7\)](#page-5-0) shows a uniform distribution of elements. So the analysis of SEM and EDAX images supports the conjugation of CoTriPTZ-OH porphyrin on MWCNT-COOH.[\[49\]](#page-11-0)

# **3.6. Raman Spectroscopy**

The Raman spectra of acid-treated multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNT-COOH) and their complexes with CoTriPTZ-OH were recorded using a 532 nm laser wavelength.[\[50\]](#page-11-0) The Raman spectra of MWCNT-COOH, nanoconjugate MWCNT-CoTriPTZ, and CoTriPTZ-OH porphyrin have been shown in **Figure [3](#page-6-0)**. The unique characteristic peak of carbon nanotubes is found at 1340 and 1573 cm<sup>−</sup>1, corresponding to D and G bands, which arise due to the structural defect and graphitic character of carbon nanotubes, respectively. The first overtone of the D-band is called G'-band and is usually observed at 2692 cm<sup>−</sup>1. The intensity ratio of the D to G-band (ID/IG) of carbon nanotubes gives evidence regarding defect and hybridization in graphitic carbon atoms of side walls due to the functionalization of carbon nanotubes. Usually, carbon nanotubes are composed of hexagonal *sp2* hybridized carbon atoms, but the increase in the D band intensity in nanoconjugate shows the modification in *sp<sup>2</sup>* carbon of MWCNT-COOH to *sp3* carbon atom. After functionalization of CoTriPTZ-OH porphyrin on MWCNT−COOH, the ID/IG ratio of MWCNT-CoTriPTZ (1.06) slightly increases as compared to MWCNT−COOH (0.95) so the increment in the ID/IG ratio of MWCNT-CoTriPTZ confirms the functionalization between MWCNT−COOH and CoTriPTZ-OH porphyrins.[\[51,52\]](#page-11-0) Raman spectroscopy is a powerful tool to investigate the vibrational frequency of various groups. In Figure [3,](#page-6-0) the peak at 386 cm<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> for CoTriPTZ-OH is characteristic of the Co-N vibrational bond.[\[53–55\]](#page-11-0) The band at 997 cm<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> is attributed to the pyrrolic vibrational breathing and the stretching mode of phenyl. The intense band that appears at 1556 cm<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> and 1496 cm<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> was attributed to − stretching mode and phenyl vibration. The remaining peaks from 1100 to 1400 cm<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> are assigned to − /−N stretching mode.[\[56\]](#page-11-0) We noticed all characteristic peaks of cobalt porphyrin (CoTriPTZ-OH) in nanoconjugate due to conjugation between CoTriPTZ-OH and MWCNT.

# **3.7. X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS)**

To know about the elemental composition and electronic information of the materials, XPS has been performed with a slow scan. **Figure [4](#page-7-0)**a depicts the XPS survey spectra of MWCNT−COOH, MWCNT-CoTriPTZ, and CoTriPTZ-OH respectively. The XPS spectrum of MWCNT−COOH shows C 1s and O 1s peaks while the XPS survey spectrum of MWCNT-CoTriPTZ shows new elements such as N 1s, S 2p, and Co 2p which confirms the presence of CoTriPTZ-OH porphyrin molecules on MWCNT-CoTriPTZ nanoconjugate.[\[38,57\]](#page-11-0) The highresolution C 1s (C = C/C-C/C-H, C-O-C, OH-C = O) and O 1s (C = O, C-O) spectra of MWCNT-COOH depict all possible bonding peaks between elements (C, H, O).[\[58,59\]](#page-11-0) The highresolution C 1s (C = C/C-C/C-H, C-N/C-O, C = N, and O = C-O) spectra of MWCNT-CoTriPTZ nanoconjugate shows the presence of new peaks (C-N, C = N) which gives the evidence regarding the functionalization of CoTriPTZ-OH porphyrin on MWCNT−COOH. Similarly, in high-resolution C 1s spectra of CoTriPTZ-OH (Figure [4d\)](#page-7-0), all bonding is present except the carboxylate ion peak (O-C = O). The N 1s high-resolution spectra in Figure [4c-1,d-1](#page-7-0) shows three peaks for N = C, N-Co, and N-C. Similarly, in the high-resolution of O 1s, the presence of a carboxylate ion peak for MWCNT-CoTriPTZ (Figure [4c-2\)](#page-7-0) is due to the ester linkage between porphyrin and MWCNT. Highresolution spectra of S 2p (Figure [4c-3,d-3\)](#page-7-0) show two peaks

# **4. Electrochemistry of MWCNT-CoTriPTZ**

To study the electrocatalytic properties of the developed electrochemical sensing platforms (ESPs), cyclic voltammetry (CV) is utilized. The MWCNT-CoTriPTZ-ESP is scanned continuously for 5–10 CV cycles at 20 mVs<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> between −0.4 to 0.4 V (vs SCE) in 0.1 M pH 7.0 phosphate buffer until a constant current response is achieved within the two sequential cycles. On attaining a constant current, the scanning of the electrode is stopped and used for further experiments with fresh electrolytes. This procedure is applied to all the electrodes for the stabilization. The CV response of MWCNT-CoTriPTZ-ESP is shown in **Figure 5**[A.](#page-7-0) The anodic (*E*pa) and cathodic (*E*pc) peak potentials at the MWCNT-CoTriPTZ-ESP are −0.038 and −0.204 V (vs SCE), respectively providing an ∆Ep value of 166 mV and *E*1/2 value of 121 mV at a scan rate 200 mVs<sup>−</sup>1. The ratio of anodic peak current (Ipa) to cathodic peak current (Ipc) is found to be 0.85. These results suggest the one-electron reversible redox reaction of Co<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup>/Co3<sup>+</sup>. The linear dependency of Ipa and Ipc against the scan rate (Figure [5B\)](#page-7-0) specifies that the redox processes are surface-confined.[\[62,63\]](#page-12-0)

#### **4.1. Electrocatalytic Oxidation and Subsequent Determination of Hydrazine**

The CV responses of different ESPs in the presence and absence of the analyte, i.e., 1.0 mM hydrazine are shown in Figure S5 (Supporting Information), ESI. CoTriPTZ-OH-ESP doesn't show any characteristic peaks in the absence as well as in the presence of 1.0 mM hydrazine (inset of Figure S5a,a', Supporting Information). In the presence of hydrazine, the CoTriPTZ-OH-ESP shows a slight increase in anodic current due to the oxidation of hydrazine (inset of Figure S5, Supporting Information). The MWCNT-COOH-ESP shows no redox peaks in the absence of hydrazine as it has no redox active species (Figure S5b, Supporting Information). On the addition of 1.0 mM hydrazine, the MWCNT-COOH-ESP (Figure S5b', Supporting Information) shows a slight increase in the anodic current at high positive potentials due to the oxidation of hydrazine. In the absence of hydrazine, MWCNT-CoTriPTZ-ESP shows characteristic redox peaks owing to the Co2<sup>+</sup>/Co3<sup>+</sup> redox process (Figure S5c, Supporting Information) as discussed earlier. In the presence of 1.0 mM hydrazine, it shows the oxidation peak at 0.159 V (vs SCE) with a high anodic current (55 μA) and a small reduction current (20 μA) at −0.250 V (vs SCE) (Figure S5c', Supporting Information). The presence of a reduction peak at −0.250 V may be attributed to the reduction of small amounts of hydrazineoxidized product N2H3, adsorbed on the MWCNT surface. The high oxidation current indicates the efficient electrocatalytic oxidation of hydrazine at the MWCNT-CoTriPTZ-ESP. The presence of MWCNT may enhance the electrocatalytic surface area *(vide infra)*[\[64\]](#page-12-0) and the electron transfer process. The CoTriPTZ-OH moiety may favor the oxidation of hydrazine at a less positive potential (0.159 V (vs SCE)).

The amperometric measurements were done to obtain the analytical parameters of the hydrazine determination at MWCNT-CoTriPTZ-ESP as shown in **Figure 6**[A.](#page-8-0) It is performed with successive additions of hydrazine in a continuously stirred electrolyte solution of 0.1 M pH 7.0 phosphate buffer at a fixed potential of 0.2 V. The addition of hydrazine is started at 300 s and at regular intervals of 50 s, hydrazine was added. A rapid and sensitive response for each addition of hydrazine is observed and the observed current is used for the construction of the calibration plot (Figure [6B\)](#page-8-0). Two-segmented linear calibration range is observed from 0.1 to 700 μM and from 0.7 to 3.0 mM. Twosegmented calibration curve indicates a low kinetics at the higher concentrations of hydrazine probably due to the competition for the active sites by the analyte. The current responses obtained for hydrazine oxidation show that MWCNT-CoTriPTZ-ESP could be used for the electrochemical sensing of hydrazine in real water samples. The sensitivity and limit of detection (based on the 3S of the blank, where S is the standard deviation) for the hydrazine determination at the MWCNT-CoTriPTZ-ESP is calculated to be 0.99 μAμM<sup>−</sup>1cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> and 4.5 ppb, respectively. The analytical parameters of the MWCNT-CoTriPTZ-ESP for hydrazine oxidation are compared with the other reported work[\[12,14,16,17,65–73\]](#page-11-0) and are shown in Table S2 (Supporting Information). The comparison clearly shows a lower detection limit with a large linear range for the suggested MWCNT-CoTriPTZ-ESP in comparison with the other reported works. It clearly shows the outstanding functioning of the MWCNT-CoTriPTZ-ESP for hydrazine oxidation.

#### **4.2. Interferences/Selectivity Studies**

To assess the selectivity of the suggested ESP for hydrazine detection, the amperometric response of 0.1 mM hydrazine in the presence of several possible interfering species with similar concentrations is noted and shown in Figure S6 (Supporting

Information). The study shows that there are negligible changes in the amperometric current responses even after the addition of possible interferences such as KCl, glucose, oxalic acid, urea, NaNO2, NaNO3, and H2O2 concluding that the proposed ESP can be selectively used for the hydrazine determination in various real samples.

#### **4.3. Electrocatalytic Oxidation of Hydrazine toward the Green Hydrogen Production**

The electrocatalytic oxidation of hydrazine was performed in 0.1 M pH 7.0 phosphate buffer in the presence of 0.16, 0.32, and 0.64 M hydrazine and it is found that the hydrazine oxidation is a diffusion-controlled process (for details Figure S7, Supporting Information and the corresponding discussion). Figure S8A–C in Supporting Information represent the CV curves of GCE/MWCNT-COOH, GCE/CoTriPTZ-OH, and GCE/MWCNT-CoTriPTZ recorded at the scan rate of 20 mVs<sup>−</sup>1. Incremental additions of hydrazine increase the current density values as shown in Figure S8A–C (Supporting Information), ESI for MWCNT-COOH, CoTriPTZ-OH, and MWCNT-CoTriPTZ nanoconjugate, respectively. Due to the excessive bubble formation at the GCE/CoTriPTZ-OH and GCE/MWCNT-CoTriPTZ electrodes in the presence of hydrazine, the CV curves are attenuated as observed in Figure S8A,C (Supporting Information) respectively in ESI. In the absence of hydrazine, no

The inset of A shows the expanded view at low concentrations of hydrazine.

such high current is observed at these three electrodes. Onset potentials for the oxidation of hydrazine (0.64 M) are measured from the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves. The LSV curves of GCE/MWCNT-COOH, GCE/CoTriPTZ-OH, and GCE/MWCNT-CoTriPTZ at a scan rate of 10 mVs<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> under the hydrodynamic conditions are shown in Figure S8D,F (Supporting Information). The onset potentials and the potential at the current density of 10 mA.cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> (j10) are chosen to assess the efficiency of hydrazine oxidation at these electrodes. GCE/MWCNT-CoTriPTZ shows the onset potential at 0.45 V (vs RHE) and achieves j10 at 0.60 V (vs RHE), while GCE/MWCNT-COOH and GCE/CoTriPTZ-OH show the onset potentials at 0.51 and 0.66 V (vs RHE) and reaches j10 at 0.72 and 1.30 V (vs RHE), respectively. The lowest onset potential for the hydrazine oxidation is achieved at GCE/MWCNT-CoTriPTZ due to the covalent attachment of CoTriPTZ-OH moiety with the MWCNT-COOH. A better onset potential for MWCNT-COOH than the CoTriPTZ-OH is observed owing to the high electrochemically active surface area (EASA, *vide infra*) and conductive nature of MWCNT-COOH. LSV responses at different concentrations of hydrazine (0.16, 0.32, and 0.64 M) are also recorded. GCE/MWCNT-CoTriPTZ shows current density values of 44.6, 57.8, and 77.3 mA.cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> at 1.45 V (vs RHE) in the presence of 0.16, 0.32, and 0.64 M hydrazine, respectively. GCE/MWCNT-COOH also showed a similar response, however, with low current density values (21.7, 42.9, and 53.9 mA.cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> respectively, in the presence of 0.16, 0.32, and 0.64 M hydrazine). GCE/CoTriPTZ-OH shows the lowest current density values (1.9, 7.4, and 14.0 mA.cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> respectively, in the presence of 0.16, 0.32, and 0.64 M hydrazine). Distorted LSV curves can be observed in the cases of GCE/MWCNT-CoTriPTZ and GCE/MWCNT-COOH due to the extensive bubble formation at the electrode. The reaction kinetics of hydrazine oxidation is further analyzed by Tafel's plots using the LSV responses obtained in the presence of 0.64 M hydrazine (Figure 7A,B). The Tafel's slope values of 72, 86, and 193 mV dec<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> are observed respectively, at GCE/MWCNT-CoTriPTZ, GCE/MWCNT-COOH, and GCE/CoTriPTZ-OH (Figure 7A,B). The smallest value of Tafel's slope in the case of MWCNT-CoTriPTZ indicates the facilitated kinetics of hydrazine oxidation at the surface of MWCNT-CoTriPTZ which is also supported by the low charge transfer resistance (Rct) *(vide infra*).

The EASA of MWCNT-COOH, CoTriPTZ-OH, and MWCNT-CoTriPTZ are determined by recording the CV in the nonfaradaic region at different scan rates (10 to 100 mVs<sup>−</sup>1) (Figure S9A–C, Supporting Information). The slope obtained by plotting the oxidation current density against the scan rate gives the double layer capacitance (Cdl) value (Figure S9D–F), Supporting Information), and the Cdl value of bare GCE

is taken as 0.02 mF.cm<sup>−</sup>2. The EASA is calculated using equation (2).

$$EASA = C_{dl(material)} / C_{dl(bare GCE)}$$
(2)

The EASA of MWCNT-COOH, CoTriPTZ-OH, and MWCNT-CoTriPTZ are found to be 120, 0.30, and 47 cm<sup>−</sup>2. The decrease in EASA of the composite (MWCNT-CoTriPTZ) compared with the MWCNT-COOH can be attributed to the integration of CoTriPTZ-OH on the surface of MWCNT-COOH, nevertheless, the activity of nanocomposite remains superior owning to the harmony between CoTriPTZ-OH and MWCNT-COOH system which facilitates better charge transfer resulting in improved kinetics and activity.

To further study the effect of hydrazine concentration, chronoamperometry was performed for 1000 s at GCE/MWCNT-CoTriPTZ with continuous stirring to get rid of the bubbles and to provide an active surface to the electrode (**Figure 8**A). Upon increasing the concentration of hydrazine (0.16, 0.32, and 0.64 M), an increase in the current density values with distorted responses is observed indicating a faster kinetics at the electrode surface. Figure 8B represents the CV responses recorded in 1.0 M KCl in the presence of ferricyanide/ferrocyanide (0.005 M each) at a scan rate of 20 mVs<sup>−</sup>1. The impedance spectroscopy responses in the range of 0.1 Hz to 100 kHz at the GCE/MWCNT-COOH, GCE/CoTriPTZ-OH, and GCE/MWCNT-CoTriPTZ are shown in Figure 8C. The faster kinetics at the GCE/MWCNT-CoTriPTZ can be attributed to the lower value of Rct (calculated by fitting the Nyquist plot with R(QR)(QR) circuit,[\[74\]](#page-12-0) 124.7 Ω) when compared to the GCE/MWCNT-COOH (534.7 Ω) and GCE/CoTriPTZ-OH (2628 Ω).

The stability of GCE/MWCNT-CoTriPTZ is studied using an amperometry technique for 3600 s at a fixed potential of 0.95 V (vs RHE) in the presence of 0.64 M hydrazine (Figure S10, Supporting Information). There is no discernible change in current density, indicating that the GCE/MWCNT-CoTriPTZ is durable for the hydrazine oxidation process.

The activity of MWCNT-CoTriPTZ towards hydrazine oxidation in the neutral medium is compared with the previous reports (**Table 1**). The hydrazine oxidation efficiency of MWCNT-CoTriPTZ is significantly better than all other materials mentioned in Table 1, except the (AgAuPdPtCu) high entropy alloys.[\[6\]](#page-11-0)

#### **4.4. The Plausible Mechanism for Hydrazine Oxidation**

The probable mechanism for the hydrazine electro-oxidation (low concentrations) can be explained as follows (Equations 3–5), the catalyst (MWCNT-CoTriPTZ) and N2H4 form an adduct ((MWCNT-CoTriPTZ(N2H4)) first which is subsequently oxidized to form [MWCNT-CoTriPTZ(N2H4)]**·<sup>+</sup>**. This is further oxidized rapidly to generate N2 and H2 which are final products of hydrazine oxidation.[\[78\]](#page-12-0)

MWCNT − CoTriPTZ( N2H4 )]<sup>⋅</sup><sup>+</sup> → MWCNT − CoTriPTZ +N2 + 4H<sup>+</sup> + 3e<sup>−</sup> (5)

The hydrazine-assisted water oxidation in the neutral medium can be understood in the following manner. Noticeably in the absence of hydrazine, no water oxidation is observed even at high potentials at different concentrations (Figure S8, Supporting Information) indicating that hydrazine assists water oxidation. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of NH2NH2 is a \* orbital, which can readily overlap with the *d*xz and *d*yz orbitals of the active site (Co, in this case).[\[79\]](#page-12-0) Adsorbed \*NH2NH2 intermediate gives electrons back to the surface of the catalyst, as indicated by the antibonding nature of its HOMO.[\[80\]](#page-12-0) At the same time for H2O, HOMO is non-bonding in nature. Thus, both H2O and NH2NH2 give electrons to the surface of the catalyst.[\[6\]](#page-11-0) Following the adsorption of NH2NH2, a transition occurs to \*NHNH2, which tends to accept electrons from the surface.[\[6\]](#page-11-0) This electron transfer decreases the electron density at the surface, consequently lowering the energy of the Fermi level and narrowing the gap between it and the HOMO of H2O. Consequently, during the experiment, in the absence of NH2NH2 OER is not observed. Following the transformation into \*NHNH2, it subsequently evolves into \*NHNH. With an increased ability to attract electrons, \*NHNH achieves greater stability on the surface compared to \*NHNH2, aided by the electron-donating influence of H2O.[\[6\]](#page-11-0) Consequently, NH2NH2 oxidation is facilitated by mutual assistance between OER and NH2NH2 oxidation on the catalyst surface.[\[6\]](#page-11-0)

# **4.5. Stability of Nanoconjugate After Catalysis**

The XRD pattern, Raman spectroscopy, TEM, and SEM images of nanoconjugate were recorded after catalysis. The XRD pattern, Raman spectra and surface morphology of nanoconjugate remains almost same before and after catalysis. The XRD spectra of MWCNT-CoTriPTZ coated indium tin oxide (ITO) and bare ITO plate have been recorded and shown in Figure S11a, Supporting Information. After catalysis, no change in the XRD spectrum of MWCNT-CoTriPTZ was observed due to agglomeration. The crystalline nature of nanoconjugate preserves after hydrazine oxidation, supporting the stability of nanoconjugate. The presence of peaks at 25.5° (002) and 40.5° (100) confirms the presence of nanoconjugate on the ITO glass. Similarly, we have recorded the Raman spectra of the bare ITO plate and nanoconjugate coated ITO plate shown in Figure S11b, Supporting Information. The Raman spectrum of the bare ITO plate does not show any significant peaks (only very low intense peaks appear at 579 and 1084 cm<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> which do not match with any peak of nanoconjugate).[\[81\]](#page-12-0) The Raman spectrum of nanoconjugate coated on an ITO plate shows three characteristic peaks at 1340 (D-band), 1570 (G-band), and 2674 cm<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> (G'-band) which are identical to Figure [3.](#page-6-0) The presence of weak peaks in nanoconjugate is indicative of porphyrin.[\[82\]](#page-12-0)

The TEM images and corresponding EDAX spectrum of nanoconjugate after catalysis show MWCNT's rope-like structure without agglomeration and breakage. The black spot in a red circle shows the presence of porphyrin on MWCNT after catalysis. Additionally, some buffer material can be seen on the surface. The elemental composition of nanoconjugate also supports the same (Figure S12a, a-1, Supporting Information). Similarly, the SEM image and corresponding EDAX spectrum of the nanoconjugate (MWCNT-CoTriPTZ) coated ITO plate have been shown in Figure S12b, b-1, Supporting Information. After catalysis, the SEM image of the nanoconjugate shows CNT strands and the elemental composition of the nanoconjugate also confirms the presence of C, N, O, S, and Co as constituents. The elemental mapping also confirms the uniform distribution of elements.[\[83\]](#page-12-0)

# **5. Conclusion**

The covalent binding of CoTriPTZ-OH moieties onto the surface of MWCNT-COOH is realized through the ester linkages and characterized through various techniques such as UV-Vis., FTIR, TGA, TEM, SEM, Raman, XPS spectroscopy. The presence of the characteristic feature of the porphyrin Soret band which is red-shifted in nanoconjugate confirms the covalent conjugation between CoTriPTZ-OH and MWCNT-COOH. In the FTIR spectrum, the presence of a carbonyl peak and in TGA analysis higher weight loss observed in nanoconjugate compared to MWCNT-COOH also confirm the presence of porphyrin in MWCNT-CoTriPTZ. The Raman spectrum of nanoconjugate shows an increment in ID/IG ratio suggesting the formation of defects in MWCNT-COOH due to covalent conjugation. The XPS analysis also confirms the presence of nitrogen, sulfur and cobalt, giving evidence regarding conjugation between MWCNT and porphyrin. The MWCNT-CoTriPTZ nanoconjugate shows the best hydrazine oxidation activity (onset potential: 0.42 V (vs RHE)) than the individual components of the nanoconjugate, *viz*. MWCNT-COOH and CoTriPTZ-OH in a neutral medium, which can be attributed to the high charge transfer kinetics, improved surface area, and synergy between the CoTriPTZ-OH moiety and MWCNT-COOH. The Hydrazine sensitivity and limit of detection for nanoconjugate are calculated as 0.99 μAμM<sup>−</sup>1cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> and 4.5 ppb, respectively. This work may further open the pathways in which the overpotential of oxygen evolution reaction can be reduced by the assistance of hydrazine oxidation in a neutral medium. Further, efficient generation of hydrogen at the counter electrode is witnessed which can be used in fuel cells and hydrogen-based energy production devices.

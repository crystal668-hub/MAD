**Hydrazine oxidation (HzOR) assisted hydrogen production offers a promising alternative to energy-intensive and sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER), improving its efficiency. However, its practical implementation demands the development of advanced electrocatalysts capable of overcoming intrinsic kinetic and charge transfer limitations. Herein, the study reports a hybrid catalyst by anchoring a -ketoenamine linked covalent organic framework (TpPa-1) on vertically aligned Co-doped MoS2 cuboids, enabling enhanced hydrazineassisted hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The molecularly engineered heterostructure leverages interfacial electronic synergism to enhance charge delocalization and interfacial conductivity, thereby improving electrocatalytic performance. The hybrid catalyst exhibits low overpotentials of 43 mV for the HER and 88 mV for the HzOR at 10 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2. Combined experimental and theoretical analyses reveal that Co doping activates MoS2, while TpPa-1 integration enhances charge delocalization and interfacial conductivity through electronic synergism. This work presents a robust strategy for molecular-level interface engineering to enable efficient, bifunctional hydrogen production, establishing a foundation for the broader application of hybrid electrocatalysts.**

## **1. Introduction**

Electrochemical water splitting is a promising approach for generating clean hydrogen, a potential key player in the future energy landscape.[\[1,2\]](#page-10-0) However, its widespread deployment is impeded by the sluggish kinetics and high thermodynamic barrier (1.23 V vs RHE) of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which significantly increases overall energy consumption and introduces safety concerns related to oxygen gas generation. To overcome these limitations, a growing body of research has explored the substitution of OER with the oxidation of small molecules, thereby lowering the anodic potential and enhancing system efficiency.[\[3\]](#page-10-0) Among the alternatives, the hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) has attracted particular attention. Owing to its highly favorable thermodynamics (-0.33 V vs RHE), rapid reaction kinetics, and generation of inert

nitrogen byproducts, HzOR presents an oxygen-free and energyefficient route for hydrogen production when paired with the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).

To date, the most active HER and HzOR catalysts rely on noble metals such as platinum and rhodium.[\[4\]](#page-10-0) However, their high cost, scarcity, and poor long-term stability limit their practical applicability. In response, earth abundant, noble metalree alternatives have been extensively explored. Among them, MoS2 has emerged as a promising HER electrocatalyst, owing to its earth abundance, moderate hydrogen binding energy, and tunable electronic structure.[\[5\]](#page-10-0) Despite these advantages, pristine MoS2 suffers from several intrinsic drawbacks such as low conductivity, limited edge-site density, and structural degradation that constrain its catalytic efficiency, especially under multielectron oxidation reactions such as HzOR.[\[6,7\]](#page-10-0) Transition metal doping has proven effective in modulating the electronic structure of MoS2 to address these limitations. In particular, Co doping has been shown to introduce localized electronic states, alter charge density distribution, and activate additional catalytic sites within the MoS2 framework.[\[8\]](#page-10-0) Yet, even Co-doped MoS2 (CoMoS2) remains limited by interfacial charge transfer bottlenecks,

electronic heterogeneity, and poor anodic activity due to inefficient electron delocalization and mismatched energy levels between active sites and the conductive support.<sup>[9]</sup>

To overcome these limitations, attention has turned to hybrid architectures that couple  $CoMoS_2$  with conductive materials to engineer more favorable electronic pathways. Among these, covalent organic frameworks (COF) offer an especially attractive platform. With their extended  $\pi$ -conjugation, crystallinity, and chemical tunability, COF supports directional charge transport and enables the molecular anchoring of catalytic centers, offering new opportunities to design well-defined heterointerfaces that facilitate both HER and HzOR. Despite this promise, the mechanistic principles by which COF modulates electronic coupling and interfacial charge dynamics in hybrid electrocatalysts remain underexplored. It particular, the potential for interfacial electronic synergism arising from the coupling between doped semiconductors and  $\pi$ -conjugated COF has yet to be fully understood.

In this work, we report the rational design of a hybrid electrocatalyst composed of Co-doped MoS<sub>2</sub> interfaced with the  $\beta$ ketoenamine-linked COF TpPa-1, immobilized on nickel foam. This architecture is deliberately engineered to achieve strong electronic communication at the interface, promote charge delocalization, and align Fermi levels to reduce carrier scattering. Through a combination of electrochemical measurements, structural analysis, and density functional theory (DFT) simulations, we elucidate the mechanisms by which the hybrid structure facilitates synergistic charge redistribution under HER and HzOR conditions. The resulting system exhibits low overpotentials and high current densities, demonstrating the efficacy and scalability of this approach. Our findings offer critical insights into the interfacial engineering of hybrid electrocatalysts, opening new avenues for efficient and sustainable hydrogen production via hydrazine-assisted pathways.

#### 2. Results and Discussion

## 2.1. Synthesis and Structural Characterizations

The synthesis of the TpPa-1-CoMoS $_2$  hybrid is schematically illustrated in Figure 1a involving a stepwise growth process designed to establish molecular-level interfacial integration. Vertically aligned CoMoS $_2$  cuboids were first hydrothermally grown on nickel foam (NF), followed by an in situ solvothermal polymerization of TpPa-1, forming coupled interface. The resulting electronic interaction between CoMoS $_2$  and TpPa-1 is probed using ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS), as shown in Figure 1b,c. The work function ( $\Phi$ ) was determined from the UPS spectra using the following equation: [13]

$$\Phi = hv - (E_{\text{cutoff}} - E_{\text{f}}) \tag{1}$$

where hv is the photon energy used to probe the band structure (21.22 eV for He I),  $E_{\rm cutoff}$  is the secondary electron cutoff, and  $E_{\rm f}$  is the Fermi edge. The UPS spectra show an increase in  $\Phi$  from 4.15 eV (CoMoS<sub>2</sub>) to 4.87 eV upon hybrid formation, evidencing electron transfer from CoMoS<sub>2</sub> to TpPa-1 due to Fermi level equilibration. Concurrently, the valence band maximum (VBM) shifts from 3.90 to 1.00 eV below the vacuum level,

suggesting a relative energy level organization of ≈2.90 eV at the interface (Figure S1, Supporting Information), which may reflect band bending induced by interfacial electronic coupling. To further dissect the electronic band alignment, vacuum referenced band diagram was constructed (Figure S2, Supporting Information), showing a strong interfacial electronic coupling that promotes efficient charge delocalization and lowers the activation barrier for redox transformations. Moreover, the vacuum referenced band alignment (Figure 1d) illustrates a favorable energetic gradient for directional electron migration from CoMoS<sub>2</sub> to TpPa-1 under electrochemical bias, consistent with interfacial charge redistribution and redox acceleration during HzOR. This process is further illustrated in Figure 1e, which shows the redistribution of electrons from CoMoS<sub>2</sub> to TpPa-1 upon hybrid formation. Charge density difference analysis (Figure 1f) reveals clear electron accumulation on TpPa-1 and corresponding depletion on CoMoS<sub>2</sub>, showing interfacial charge polarization and strong electronic coupling.

To gain microscopic insights into the origin of enhanced electrocatalytic activity, we conducted a series of conductive atomic force microscopy (c-AFM) experiments under ambient, bias applied dry conditions (Figure 2a). To establish a comparative foundation, topographic Z-height maps of CoMoS<sub>2</sub> and TpPa-1-CoMoS<sub>2</sub> were first acquired and presented in Figure S3 (Supporting Information). Both materials exhibit vertically aligned cuboids, where the surface of TpPa-1-CoMoS<sub>2</sub> appears notably rougher, an indicator of TpPa-1 framework integrating with CoMoS<sub>2</sub> domains. Subsequently, Z-height current images (Figure 2b,f) captured under a DC bias reflect the topography correlated conductivity across the scanned surfaces, with TpPa-1-CoMoS<sub>2</sub> showing a more spatially uniform and widespread current response.

Current maps under forward and reverse bias (Figure 2c,g) further highlight the differences in conduction behavior of the materials.  $CoMoS_2$  shows bias-asymmetric and isolated conductive spots, whereas  $TpPa-1-CoMoS_2$  presents a more continuous current distribution, indicative of robust and interfacial transport networks established by TpPa-1 incorporation. The IV characteristics at selected points for  $CoMoS_2$  (Figure 2d,e) and  $TpPa-1-CoMoS_2$  (Figure 2h,i) show significantly improved slope and symmetry in the hybrid, reflecting enhanced charge injection behavior and reduced local hysteresis.

To decouple the intrinsic contribution of the COF component, c-AFM measurements were also performed on pristine TpPa-1 films (Figure S4, Supporting Information). The topography (Figure S4a, Supporting Information) reveals a fibrous, low-relief morphology typical of polymeric COF layers. The corresponding current maps (Figure S4b,c, Supporting Information) and IV characteristics (Figure S4d,e, Supporting Information) show low current values across the full bias range.

Figure 3 summarizes the morphological and structural evolution of the TpPa-1-CoMoS<sub>2</sub> hybrid. The schematic in Figure 3a illustrates the atomic model of TpPa-1-CoMoS<sub>2</sub> hybrid, providing structural context for the material transformation. The bare NF substrate (Figure 3b) exhibits a porous, interconnected 3D framework, serving as a mechanically robust scaffold. In the absence of cobalt, MoS<sub>2</sub> forms disordered, flake like aggregates with poor long-range order (Figure S5, Supporting Information). By contrast, Co incorporation induces a significant morphological shift

(Figure [3c\)](#page-4-0), resulting in vertically aligned CoMoS2 nanocuboids uniformly anchored to the substrate. This anisotropic structure, likely influenced by Co-mediated modulation of nucleation and crystal orientation, enhances edge-site exposure and promotes electrolyte accessibility.[\[14\]](#page-11-0) Subsequent in situ polymerization of TpPa-1 onto CoMoS2 results in a conformal coating (Figure [3d\)](#page-4-0), in contrast to the irregular, aggregated domains observed when pristine TpPa-1was synthesized without the CoMoS2 substrate (Figure S6, Supporting Information). To assess morphological sensitivity to COF loading, TpPa-1-CoMoS2 hybrids were synthesized at varying ratios (Figure S7, Supporting Information). The cuboidal architecture remained intact across all samples, though increased TpPa-1 content, especially at the 3:7 ratio, led to visibly denser surface coverage. This templated hybridization establishes a structurally coherent interface, driven by –d orbital interactions, which ensures intimate contact between the inorganic core and organic shell.

The morphological and structural characteristics of the TpPa-1-CoMoS2 hybrid were further examined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Figure [3e–g\)](#page-4-0). Low magnification TEM (Figure [3e\)](#page-4-0) confirms the uniform, elongated CoMoS2 nanocuboids conformally coated by the TpPa-1 layer, consistent with the SEM observations. High resolution TEM (HRTEM) images (Figure [3f,g\)](#page-4-0) reveal distinct lattice fringes of 0.28 and 0.31 nm, assigned to the (100) and (102) planes of CoMoS2, validating the crystalline integrity and intimate hybrid interface.[\[15\]](#page-11-0)

To better contextualize these results, Figures S8–S10 (Supporting Information) compare the pristine materials. Figure S8 (Supporting Information) shows vertically aligned CoMoS2

nanocuboids with lattice fringes of 0.28 nm, consistent with its (100) plane, while Figure \$9 (Supporting Information) reveals MoS<sub>2</sub> disordered stacked-layer morphology with a characteristic interplanar distance of 0.62 nm, matching the (002) reflection.[16] The TpPa-1 material alone (Figure \$10 Supporting Information) exhibits aggregated nanodomains with  $\beta$ -ketoenamine linked frameworks. Notably, when TpPa-1 is hybridized with CoMoS<sub>2</sub>, the interfacial contact is significantly more intimate and structurally coherent compared to the loosely aggregated TpPa-1 alone. Moreover, TEM analysis across different CoMoS<sub>2</sub>: TpPa-1 ratios (Figure S11, Supporting Information) reveals consistent structural integrity of the hybrid architecture, with no observable morphological deviations. Elemental distribution within the TpPa-1-CoMoS<sub>2</sub> hybrid was further validated by TEM-EDS mapping (Figure 3h), which confirms the homogeneous dispersion of Co, Mo, S, C, and N across the nanostructure, reinforcing the successful conformal growth of the COF layer over the CoMoS<sub>2</sub> scaffold. To provide a comparative perspective, the SEM EDS mapping images (Figure S12, Supporting Information) detail the individual material components, showing the incorporation of the required elements.

The XRD patterns in Figure 3i reveal the distinct crystalline features of MoS<sub>2</sub>, CoMoS<sub>2</sub>, and the TpPa-1-CoMoS<sub>2</sub> hybrid. Pristine MoS₂ displays characteristic reflections at ≈14.2°, 32.6°, and 58.3°, corresponding to the (002), (100), and (110) planes, respectively, indicative of its layered hexagonal structure.[17] Upon Co incorporation, the CoMoS<sub>2</sub> pattern shows slight peak broadening and subtle shifts, reflecting lattice distortion due to Co substitution within the MoS2 matrix. Notably, the TpPa-1-CoMoS2 hybrid retains the diffraction features of CoMoS2 alongside broad, low intensity reflections below 10°, characteristic of the TpPa-1, confirming successful hybrid formation.[18] This confirms successful hybrid formation and interfacial integration without compromising the integrity of the inorganic phase. The minor shifts and changes in peak shape further imply strong interfacial interaction. The diffraction patterns remain reproducible across different CoMoS<sub>2</sub>/TpPa-1 ratios (Figure S13, Supporting Information), confirming the robustness of the hybridization process.

The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses presented in Figure 3j,k provides detailed insight into the chemical states of the materials. In the Mo 3d region, pristine MoS<sub>2</sub> exhibits characteristic doublets at  $\approx 232.8$  eV (Mo  $3d_{5/2}$ ) and  $\approx 236$  eV (Mo  $3d_{3/2}$ ), consistent with Mo<sup>4+</sup> in MoS<sub>2</sub> environment.[19] Upon Co doping, these peaks shift slightly downward to ≈232 eV and ≈235 eV, indicating partial electron donation from Co dopants to the Mo centers. In the TpPa-1-CoMoS<sub>2</sub> hybrid, the Mo 3d peaks revert closer to  $\approx$ 232 eV (Mo 3d<sub>5/2</sub>) and  $\approx$ 236 eV (Mo 3d<sub>3/2</sub>), reflecting a re-equilibration of the Mo oxidation environment, likely due to interfacial electron withdrawal by the  $\pi$ -conjugated TpPa-1 layer. The S 2p spectrum further corroborates this behavior. Pristine MoS<sub>2</sub> shows typical doublets at  $\approx$ 162.2 eV (S 2p<sub>3/2</sub>) and  $\approx$ 163.4 eV (S 2p<sub>1/2</sub>). With Co doping, CoMoS<sub>2</sub> exhibits a modest positive shift of  $\approx 0.3$  to 0.5 eV, suggesting increased electron deficiency at the sulfur sites due to Co induced lattice distortion and charge redistribution. In the TpPa-1-CoMoS<sub>2</sub> hybrid, the S 2p peaks shift slightly back toward lower binding energy (≈162.1 and ≈163.3 eV), indicating partial electron back donation attributed to  $\pi$ -d orbital interactions.

The high-resolution Co 2p XPS spectra of CoMoS<sub>2</sub> and TpPa-1-CoMoS<sub>2</sub> (Figure S14, Supporting Information) exhibit two prominent peaks centered at  $\approx$ 780.2 eV (Co 2p<sub>3/2</sub>) and  $\approx$ 796.5 eV (Co 2p<sub>1/2</sub>), accompanied by broad satellite features, which are indicative of a mixed-valence state involving both Co<sup>2+</sup> and Co<sup>3+</sup> species. These features reflect the partially oxidized electronic environment of Co arising from lattice substitution and possible surface hydroxyl coordination. In the TpPa-1-CoMoS<sub>2</sub> hybrid, the Co 2p peaks exhibit a subtle positive shift (≈0.2 eV) relative to CoMoS<sub>2</sub>, suggesting electron withdrawal from the Co centers. Such charge redistribution points to strong  $\pi$ –d orbital hybridization and reinforces the formation of an electronically coupled heterojunction that facilitates charge delocalization across the interface. The survey XPS spectrum (Figure S15, Supporting Information) confirms the successful incorporation of all expected elements, including C, N, Mo, Co, and S, with no extraneous signals. High-resolution scans of the C 1s and N 1s regions (Figure S16, Supporting Information) further validate the chemical fidelity of the TpPa-1 framework in the hybrid composite, showing well-resolved peaks at  $\approx$ 284.8 eV and  $\approx$ 399.4 eV, respectively, consistent with the  $\beta$ -ketoenamine linkage. [20] The Co 2p spectrum (Figure \$17, Supporting Information) confirms uniform Co incorporation, with no evidence of phase segregation or metallic Co. For comparison, the pristine TpPa-1 spectrum (Figure S17, Supporting Information) displays similar C 1s and N 1s features, confirming that the COF retains its molecular structure upon hybridization. These XPS results collectively establish the successful formation of a chemically integrated hybrid and directly support the proposed interfacial electronic synergism.

The FTIR spectra (Figure \$18, Supporting Information) provide compelling vibrational fingerprints validating the successful formation of the TpPa-1-CoMoS<sub>2</sub> hybrid. For pristine MoS<sub>2</sub> and CoMoS<sub>2</sub>, weak absorption features are observed in the 450– 500 cm<sup>-1</sup> region, corresponding to Mo-S stretching vibrations within the MoS<sub>2</sub>.<sup>[21]</sup> These bands affirm the retention of the inorganic lattice across Co doping. In contrast, TpPa-1 exhibits prominent vibrational bands characteristic of its  $\beta$ -ketoenaminelinked framework, including sharp peaks at ≈1620 cm<sup>-1</sup> (C = N stretching),  $\approx 1500$  cm<sup>-1</sup> (aromatic C = C stretching), and  $\approx$ 1260 cm<sup>-1</sup> (C-N stretching), corroborating its well-ordered  $\pi$ conjugated structure.[22] The hybrid TpPa-1-CoMoS<sub>2</sub> spectrum shows both the Mo-S modes and TpPa-1 signature peaks, albeit with noticeable broadening and redshifts ( $\Delta v \approx 5-15$  cm<sup>-1</sup>). These shifts reflect interfacial  $\pi$ -d orbital interactions, suggesting partial electronic coupling at the heterointerface. Such spectral modulation indicates a strong molecular-level integration, rather than mere physical mixing. Moreover, the FTIR profiles across varying CoMoS2/TpPa-1 ratios (Figure S19, Supporting Information) remain spectrally consistent, further affirming the chemical robustness of TpPa-1 under solvothermal hybridization and the reproducibility of the hybrid formation process.

To gain quantitative insights into the structural and textural architecture of the materials, N<sub>2</sub> adsorption-desorption isotherms and the corresponding pore size distribution profiles were evaluated (Figure S20, Supporting Information). TpPa-1-CoMoS2 exhibits a characteristic type-IV isotherm with a well-defined hysteresis loop, signifying the presence of disordered mesopores, whereas CoMoS2 and MoS2 display less developed adsorption profiles, reflecting limited porosity and surface accessibility.<sup>[23]</sup> The BET surface area of TpPa-1-CoMoS2 is significantly enhanced, showing more than three times higher than that of CoMoS<sub>2</sub> or MoS<sub>2</sub>, due to the intrinsic microporosity of the TpPa-1 and Co-doping induced mesopores. This is corroborated by the pore size distribution, which reveals that TpPa-1-CoMoS<sub>2</sub> features a dual pore regime centered around 2–5 nm, corresponding to mesopores originating from the CoMoS2 nanocuboids, along with sub-nanometer micropores arising from the TpPa-1 framework. This hierarchical pore structure, combining both microporosity from the organic framework and mesoporosity from the inorganic scaffold, enhances ion diffusion kinetics by reducing transport resistance, and maximizes interfacial surface area for catalytic accessibility.

#### 2.2. Investigation of Electrochemical HER Performance

The HER performance of the synthesized catalysts is comprehensively evaluated (Figure 4), highlighting the superior electrocatalytic efficiency of the TpPa-1-CoMoS<sub>2</sub> hybrid. As shown in the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves (Figure 4a), the TpPa-1-CoMoS<sub>2</sub> composite exhibits a markedly lower overpotential to reach a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> compared to MoS<sub>2</sub> and CoMoS2, underscoring the synergistic contribution of both components in facilitating HER kinetics. To evaluate the compositional influence on HER activity, hybrids with CoMoS<sub>2</sub>/TpPa-1 ratios of 2:8, 6:4, and 7:3 were compared (Figure S21, Supporting Information). Among them, the 6:4 ratio exhibited the lowest overpotential and highest current density, indicating optimal interfacial charge transfer and catalytic site accessibility at this composition. The bar chart in Figure 4b highlights the overpotential trends at different current densities. Across the range (10, 50, and 100 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>), TpPa-1-CoMoS<sub>2</sub> exhibited the lowest overpotentials compared to MoS<sub>2</sub> and CoMoS<sub>2</sub>. Tafel slope analysis (Figure 4c) provides mechanistic insight into the HER pathway. The reduced Tafel slope (32.4 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>) for TpPa-1-CoMoS<sub>2</sub> indicates that the reaction follows a Volmer–Heyrovsky mechanism, where electrochemical desorption becomes the ratedetermining step. This improved kinetics relative to CoMoS<sub>2</sub>

(40.08 mV dec<sup>−</sup>1) suggests that the integration with TpPa-1 facilitates faster charge-transfer steps through -conjugated pathways, reducing activation barriers.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements (Figure 4d) further validate the enhanced interfacial conductivity of the hybrid. The smallest semicircle diameter in the Nyquist plot for TpPa-1-CoMoS2 reflects the lowest charge-transfer resistance (Rct), confirming rapid electron mobility across the hybrid interface. This is consistent with earlier UPS and charge-density analysis, highlighting the formation of an interfacial dipole that drives efficient charge separation and tunneling. Figure 4e presents the double-layer capacitance (Cdl) values, which serve as a proxy for electrochemically active surface area (ECSA), determined from non-faradaic cyclic voltammetry measurements at various scan rates (Figure S22, Supporting Information).

TpPa-1-CoMoS2 demonstrates the highest Cdl among the tested samples, suggesting a high density of accessible catalytic sites, likely originating from the mesoporous structure of TpPa-1 and the enhanced interfacial area provided by the uniformly distributed CoMoS2 nanocuboids. When benchmarked against state-of-the-art non-noble metal HER catalysts (Figure 4f), TpPa-1-CoMoS2 falls into a competitive region, combining low overpotential and high stability, marking it as a promising alternative to noble metal-based systems. The long-term operational durability of the hybrid is evaluated by chronopotentiometry at 100 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> (Figure 4g), showing negligible potential drift over extended testing, confirming excellent structural and chemical stability under continuous operation. Furthermore, post-stability LSV curves (Figure 4h) show minimal degradation in catalytic activity, demonstrating the robustness of the hybrid interface and the chemical integrity of both CoMoS2 and TpPa-1 frameworks after prolonged electrolysis.

ing the multifunctionality of the TpPa-1-CoMoS2 hybrid beyond HER. Figure 5a reveals the concentration-dependent catalytic response of TpPa-1-CoMoS2 toward hydrazine oxidation. The pronounced increase in current density with increasing hydrazine concentration highlights the excellent substrate affinity and catalytic sensitivity of the hybrid interface, which is essential for real-world applications in selective anodic reactions. The comparative LSV curves (Figure 5b) confirm that TpPa-1-CoMoS2 exhibits the lowest overpotentials at all tested current densities in a 1 m KOH + 0.5 m N2H4 electrolyte, outperforming pristine MoS2 and CoMoS2. These findings are quantitatively summarized in Figure 5c, where the hybrid shows a remarkably low overpotential of ≈94 mV at 10 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2, demonstrating a distinct advantage over conventional HzOR catalysts and underscoring the importance of interfacial electronic modulation. Figure 5d presents the Tafel plots, indicating the kinetic behavior of HzOR across the different materials. The TpPa-1-CoMoS2 hybrid yields a notably low Tafel slope of 27.3 mV dec<sup>−</sup>1, suggesting accelerated electron transfer and a favorable reaction pathway. This enhancement is attributed to the synergetic effect of Co doping, which modulates the MoS2 electronic structure, and the -conjugated TpPa-1 matrix, which establishes an extended charge delocalization network that accelerates interfacial redox kinetics. EIS in Figure 5e supports this interpretation by demonstrating that TpPa-1-CoMoS2 has the smallest charge-transfer resistance among the tested samples. The reduced impedance at the catalyst-electrolyte interface is consistent with UPS and charge-density results discussed earlier, confirming the role of interfacial band alignment in improving HzOR kinetics. To further validate catalytic reversibility and kinetic control, LSV scans at various rates (Figure 5f) show a consistent increase in current density, indicating diffusion-controlled HzOR behavior with

rapid kinetics. This feature is essential for high turnover applications such as direct hydrazine fuel cells (DHzFC) or hybrid electrolysis systems. Long-term stability, a crucial parameter for practical catalyst deployment, is confirmed in the chronopotentiometry test (Figure 5g). The negligible change in potential over extended operation at 100 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> confirms the robustness of the hybrid framework. Post-stability LSV curves (Figure 5h) remain nearly identical to the initial profiles, reflecting excellent chemical and structural durability of both CoMoS<sub>2</sub> and TpPa-1 under HzOR conditions.

Furthermore, post-stability characterization using XRD, XPS, and SEM (Figures S23–S25, Supporting Information) was conducted to assess structural and chemical retention of the catalyst following prolonged stability operation. These post-electrolysis characterizations collectively confirm that the TpPa-1-CoMoS<sub>2</sub> hybrid maintains its structural morphology, crystallographic features, and surface chemical states, underscoring the material's robustness and interfacial stability under extended operation.

## 2.4. Investigation of HzOR Assisted HER Dual Electrode Performance

To demonstrate the practical viability of TpPa-1- $CoMoS_2$  as a bifunctional catalyst, **Figure 6** explores its performance in a two-electrode configuration. The LSV curve in Figure 6a showcases the low cell voltage required for overall hydrogen production when pairing the HER and HzOR half-reactions using TpPa-1- $CoMoS_2$  at both electrodes. The minimal voltage difference between the HER and HzOR onset potentials (0.41 V) indi-

cates high thermodynamic favorability and catalytic compatibility within the same material platform. Such near-symmetric electrochemical behavior is rarely observed in non-noble metal systems, emphasizing the unique dual-functionality enabled by electronic synergism across the TpPa-1-CoMoS2 interface. A comparative analysis of the two-electrode performance for HzOR versus the OER is shown in Figure 6b. The system utilizing hydrazine oxidation (1 M KOH + 0.5 M  $N_2H_4$ ) exhibits drastically improved current density at any given voltage relative to the O2 evolution-based setup (1 M KOH), confirming the superior kinetics of HzOR. Figure 6c quantitatively illustrates this advantage at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> where the hydrazine-based system requires only  $\approx 0.22$  V, while OER exceeds 1.60 V underscoring an ≈87% reduction in energy input for the same hydrogen output. This voltage gap reaffirms the strategic replacement of OER with HzOR as a viable pathway for sustainable, energy-efficient hydrogen production.

The schematic in Figure 6d presents a conceptual design of a self-powered hydrogen production unit, integrating a DHzFC with an electrochemical water-splitting system. The left cell operates as a DHzFC, harvesting chemical energy from hydrazine oxidation and directly powering the right-side water-splitting unit to drive HER. This tandem architecture eliminates the need for external power sources and mitigates issues of explosive H<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>2</sub> mixtures, given that nitrogen is the only anodic byproduct. Such configurations represent a crucial step toward decentralized, grid-independent hydrogen production technologies. Finally, the discharge polarization and power density plots in Figure 6e validate the energy output of the DHzFC. The open-circuit voltage exceeds 0.8 V, and the system achieves a maximum power density over 100 mW cm<sup>-2</sup>, ranking competitively among

reported DHzFCs based on non-noble metal catalysts. These metrics reflect the excellent electronic conductivity and catalytic activity of TpPa-1-CoMoS<sub>2</sub>, which enables efficient energy conversion across both anodic and cathodic processes. By leveraging interfacial electronic engineering, the TpPa-1-CoMoS<sub>2</sub> hybrid not only excels in HER and HzOR kinetics but also enables functional device architectures for sustainable hydrogen production under ambient conditions. This integrative approach marks a critical advancement toward next-generation electrochemical energy systems that are both efficient and environmentally benign.

#### 2.5. Theoretical Calculation

To elucidate the fundamental mechanisms governing the enhanced electrocatalytic performance of the  $TpPa-1-CoMoS_2$  hy-

brid, DFT calculations were performed for both the HER and HzOR. Guided by HRTEM and XRD data, the heterointerface was modeled using the energetically favorable CoMoS2 (002)/TpPa-1 configuration (Figure 7a). Given the crucial role of water adsorption in alkaline catalysis, the adsorption energies ( $E_{ads}$ ) of  $H_2O$  molecules on representative active sites were calculated.[24] As shown in Figure 7b and Figure S26 (Supporting Information), pristine MoS<sub>2</sub> exhibits a water adsorption energy of 3.6 eV at the Mo site. Upon Co incorporation, the adsorption energies are reduced to 2.9 eV at Mo and 2.1 eV at Co sites in CoMoS<sub>2</sub>, reflecting improved water affinity. Strikingly, the TpPa-1-CoMoS<sub>2</sub> heterostructure further reduces the  $E_{ads}$  to 1.1 eV at the Co site, evidencing significantly enhanced water binding. This thermodynamic preference indicates stronger interaction with water, which facilitates initial steps in HER and HzOR under alkaline conditions.<sup>[25]</sup> To probe HER kinetics, the Gibbs free energy of hydrogen adsorption ( $\Delta G_{H*}$ ) was computed, as an ideal

<span id="page-10-0"></span>catalyst exhibits a  $\Delta G_{H*}$  close to zero, enabling balanced adsorption and desorption. [26] As illustrated in Figure 7c and Figures S27 and S28 (Supporting Information),  $\Delta G_{H^*}$  values for MoS<sub>2</sub> and CoMoS2 are 0.38 eV (Mo site) and 0.19 eV (Co site), respectively. The hybrid TpPa-1-CoMoS2 exhibits an even more optimal  $\Delta G_{H^*}$  of 0.09 eV at the Co site, approaching thermoneutrality. This enhancement is attributed to interfacial electronic coupling and efficient charge redistribution across the hybrid, which modulates local electronic environments and facilitates proton reduction.

To further understand the improved conductivity, density of states (DOS) profiles were analyzed (Figure 7d-f). MoS<sub>2</sub> shows a typical semiconducting character with a bandgap of  $\approx$ 2.01 eV. Co doping into MoS<sub>2</sub> significantly reduces the bandgap to  $\approx 0.57$  eV, enhancing charge transport. Integration with TpPa-1 induces further DOS delocalization and electronic hybridization near the Fermi level, confirming the formation of conductive heterointerfaces. These findings underscore the pivotal role of interface engineering and chemical modulation in promoting both thermodynamic and kinetic aspects of catalytic reactions.<sup>[27]</sup>

Furthermore, to elucidate the internal driving forces behind the improved electrocatalytic behavior observed in the TpPa-1-CoMoS<sub>2</sub> heterostructure, we calculated the work functions of the individual components. The  $\Phi$ , defined as the energy difference between the vacuum level  $(E_{vac})$  and the Fermi energy  $(E_F)$ , was computed as:[28]

$$\Phi = E_{vac} - E_F \tag{2}$$

As shown in Figure 7g,h, CoMoS2 exhibits a work function of 5.11 eV, while TpPa-1 shows a significantly higher value of 6.21 eV. This disparity in work function promotes spontaneous electron migration from CoMoS<sub>2</sub> to TpPa-1 upon hybrid formation until Fermi-level equilibration is achieved, establishing an internal electric field across the interface. To further probe the electrocatalytic origin of the superior HzOR activity, we modeled the complete hydrazine oxidation pathway on MoS<sub>2</sub>, CoMoS<sub>2</sub>, and TpPa-1-CoMoS<sub>2</sub> surfaces. As illustrated in Figure S29 (Supporting Information), the reaction mechanism involves hydrazine adsorption followed by sequential dehydrogenation steps  $(N_2H_4 \rightarrow N_2H_3 \rightarrow N_2H_2 \rightarrow N_2H \rightarrow N_2)$ , consistent with previously reported pathways.<sup>[29]</sup> The computed Gibbs free energy diagrams (Figure 7i) identify the  ${}^*N_2H_3 \rightarrow {}^*N_2H_2$  transition as the potential determining step (PDS) for all catalysts. Remarkably, TpPa-1–CoMoS<sub>2</sub> displays the lowest energy barrier ( $\Delta G =$ 0.29 eV) for this step, compared to CoMoS<sub>2</sub> (0.43 eV) and pristine MoS<sub>2</sub> (0.56 eV), indicating more favorable reaction kinetics.

#### 3. Conclusion

In summary, we report a rationally engineered hybrid electrocatalyst comprising Co-doped MoS<sub>2</sub> integrated with a TpPa-1 framework for bifunctional HER and HzOR. The heterostructure demonstrates excellent catalytic activity, marked by low overpotentials, fast kinetics, and robust stability. Systematic characterization and DFT calculations reveal that interfacial electronic coupling driven by work function disparity and Fermi-level equilibration facilitates directional charge transfer from CoMoS<sub>2</sub> to TpPa-1, enhancing charge delocalization and active site accessibility.

The catalyst delivers remarkably low overpotentials for both HER and HzOR, indicating its high intrinsic activity and efficiency. Integration into a two-electrode system further highlights its potential for efficient, low-energy hydrogen production. This work provides a versatile platform for advancing molecular-level interface design in high-performance, noble-metal-free electrocatalysis.

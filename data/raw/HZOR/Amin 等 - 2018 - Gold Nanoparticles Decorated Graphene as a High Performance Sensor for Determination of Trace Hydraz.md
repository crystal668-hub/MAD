Abstract: Electrochemical sensors provide a selective, sensitive and an easy approach to detect hazardous substances such as hydrazine. Herein, we investigate a facile route for the fabrication of a nanostructured composite based on Au nanoparticles (AuNPs) decorated graphene and present its sensing performance towards hydrazine. Our strategy involves electrophoretic deposition (EPD) of graphene oxide (GO) on Au substrate to obtain a uniform layer EPD-GO, followed by electrochemical reduction of GO to yield high quality graphene ERGO and electrodeposition of monodispersed AuNPs on ERGO (AuNPs/ERGO/Au). The modified AuNPs/ ERGO/Au electrode was characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) techniques. The sensor exhibited an improved catalytic activity with a peak potential of +87 mV (vs. Ag/AgCl) for hydrazine oxidation. The high performance of this hybrid electrode is due to the presence of a synergistic effect between AuNPs and ERGO at their interface. Insights into the mechanism and kinetics of hydrazine oxidation are withdrawn from varying the voltage scan rate as the reaction is fully irreversible and diffusion-controlled. The proposed hydrazine sensor showed suitability for nanomolar detection (detection limit of 74 nM), high selectivity in the presence of common ions and efficiency for application in water samples.

## 1 Introduction

Hydrazine is a widely used substance in various industrial, agricultural and military applications. It is used as a reducing agent, corrosion inhibitor, antioxidant, emulsifier and fuel in rocket propulsion systems. Furthermore, it is used as a starting material in the production of some insecticides, herbicides, pesticides, dyestuffs, explosives and in the preparation of several pharmaceutical derivatives [1]. Also, hydrazine is recognized as a carcinogenic substance, which causes damage of the liver, kidneys and central nervous system in human upon acute exposure [2]. Therefore, determination of hydrazine is of practical importance. Among several methods that have been reported for determination of hydrazine, voltammetric method possesses many advantages such as high sensitivity, wide linear range, good selectivity, rapid response and simple operating procedure [3].

Hydrazine exhibits an irreversible oxidation which requires a high overpotential at conventional electrodes. Therefore, several approaches have been investigated in an attempt to minimize this high overpotential and to improve the sensor response. Chemically modified electrodes provide advantages in the design of electrochemical sensors. A variety of chemically modified electrodes has thus been developed for detection of hydrazine including phthalocyanines [4], hexacyanoferrates [5] and polypyrrole [6]. Metal nanoparticles NPs have also been used to enhance the electron transfer rate [3a, 7]. For instance, PdNPs [3a, 8] and multi-metallic NPs [7] were reported for this purpose. Due to the beneficial properties of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) as good conductivity, useful electrocatalytic activity and biocompatibility, they have been widely used in electrochemical sensors and biosensors [9]. AuNPs dispersed on a variety of substrates such as carbon nanotubes [9], carbon paste electrode [10], self-assembled monolayer [11] and polymers [12] have been reported. For example, AuNPs modified carbon nanotubes electrode exhibited an outstanding catalytic activity towards hydrazine oxidation [35].

The discovery of graphene has opened up a new era of two-dimensional (2D) fundamental science and modern technology [13]. Graphene, the thinnest material in the universe [14], has attracted a tremendous attention in the last two decades because of a few intriguing characteristics; fast electron transfer, high thermal conductivity, excellent mechanical stiffness and good biocompatibility[15], which makes it a promising candidate in numerous

applications as bioelectronics [16], solar cells [17], supercapacitors [15] and electrochemical sensors [18].

The preparation of high-quality reduced graphene oxide (RGO) sheets is a crucial step in the production of graphene-based devices. Solution-based deposition methods, including membrane filtration [19], dip coating [20], layer-by-layer [21], spray coating [22] and spin coating [23] have been reported for graphene thin films preparation. In addition, chemical reduction of graphene oxide is a commercially used route for large scale production of graphene [24]. However, on one hand the reducing agents employed in these processes are carcinogenic and could contaminate the resulting materials and on the other hand, oxygenated species that cannot so far be fully removed by chemical treatment will heavily influence the electronic properties and thus limits graphene applications. Recently, green methods including laser scribing [25] or using flash of light [26] have been applied to produce highly interconnected and flexible graphene sheets. Alternative approach is the electrophoretic deposition (EPD), which is a well-developed and economical method that has been successfully applied for the deposition of graphene films [27]. EPD method provides high deposition rate, good thickness controllability, good uniformity and simplicity of scale up [27]. Therefore, EPD step followed by electrochemical reduction step offers an effective and facile approach for the synthesis of high quality graphene nanosheets. This approach has significant advantages: It is fast and green procedure and no toxic solvents are used and thus it avoids contamination of the product. Furthermore, the applied high negative potential can overcome the energy barriers for the reduction of oxygen functionalities. Thus, the exfoliated GO can be efficiently reduced [28].

By combining the aforementioned advantages of graphene with those of nanostructured metals, a synergistic interaction is expected in their hybrid, leading to unusual electronic properties and improvement in their catalytic properties. Several graphene-based metal nanocomposites have been used as an electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction [29], glucose oxidation [30], catechol oxidation [31]; as sensors for mercury [32] and dopamine [33] and for supercapacitors [34].

Recently, some reports discussed the use of AuNPsgraphene composite for hydrazine sensing. However, they require either high temperature [36] or a more complex synthesis procedure [37]. Few reports demonstrated the application of Au-modified graphene electrodes for trace detection of hydrazine; however they revealed higher overpotentials [37–38]. Therefore, fabrication of an efficient and highly sensitive electrode for hydrazine detection is still highly desirable.

In this work, an environmentally friendly procedure was applied to fabricate AuNPs/ERGO nanocomposite. A high quality graphene was prepared by EPD method followed by an electrochemical reduction and the produced film of ERGO was then utilized as a platform for electrodeposition of monodispersed AuNPs. The novelty lies in: first; the use of a facile and sustainable synthetic strategy for the fabrication of a high quality AuNPs/ ERGO nanocomposite, second; precise control over the particle size of AuNPs and formation of a layer of monodispersed particles which consequently led to an improvement in the kinetics and performance towards hydrazine oxidation (i. e. one of the lowest overpotentials reported, detection limit down to level of 0.07 mM and a wide linear range 4–8000 mM). The prepared AuNPs/ ERGO/Au electrode is well characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) techniques. Due to the possible contamination of drinking water with hydrazine, we successfully tested this electrode as an efficient sensor for hydrazine, as an example, in real water samples. The remarkable activity and stability of AuNPs/ERGO/Au electrode suggests a synergistic effect between AuNPs and ERGO film, thus this material may be considered as an effective approach in the practical assessment of hydrazine.

# 2 Experimental

## 2.1 Chemicals

Graphite powder (<20 mm particle size) and HAuCl4 · 3H2O (-99.9%) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, USA and were used as received. Hydrazine (99%) was obtained from PANREAC QUIMICA SA, Spain. All other chemicals were of analytical grade and were used without further purification. The 0.1 M phosphate buffer solutions (PBS) at various pH values were prepared from NaH2PO4 and Na2HPO4. Doubly distilled water was used to prepare all solutions.

# 2.2 Instrumentation

All electrochemical measurements were conducted using BAS-100B potentiostat (BAS Inc., USA) connected to a personal computer. Electrophoretic deposition process was carried out in a two-electrode glass cell equipped with a regulated direct current (DC) power supply. A threeelectrode one-compartment glass cell was used for all other electrochemical experiments: Au electrode or modified Au electrode as the working electrodes, Ag/ AgCl (4 M KCl) as the reference electrode and platinum wire as the counter electrode. All experiments were carried out at ambient temperature. All potentials in this paper were reported versus Ag/AgCl electrode. SEM images were collected using JOEL 6700, Philips XL 30 instrument. For SEM imaging, the ERGO film was deposited on a Cu substrate and in this case AuNPs were deposited from 0.2 mM HAuCl4 solution. FT-IR spectroscopy was performed with a JASCO FT/IR-4100.

# 2.3 Fabrication of GO by Electrophoretic Deposition and its Electrochemical Reduction to Graphene Nanosheets

Graphene oxide (GO) was prepared from graphite powder adopting a modified Hummers method [39]. The procedure was as follows: 4 g of graphite powder was added into cold (08C) concentrated H2SO4 (100 mL) solution. Then, 15 g KMnO4 was added gradually under stirring and the temperature of the mixture was kept bellow 108C for 1 h. The mixture was then stirred at 358C for one hour. Afterwards, it was cooled down in an ice bath and subsequently, diluted by 200 mL deionized water (DI), stirred for 2 h and then further diluted by adding 200 mL DI. Afterwards, 40 mL of 30% H2O2 was added to the mixture to reduce the residual KMnO4. Large amount of bubbles was released and the color of mixture changed into brilliant yellow. Finally, the mixture was filtered and washed with 5% aqueous HCl solution (300 mL) and followed by DI (two or three times). The resulting solid was dried at 608C for 24 h to obtain the dark brown powder of GO.

For electrophoretic deposition (EPD), GO was dispersed in DI and sonicated for 2 hours at ambient temperature. Prior to use, Au electrode was mechanically polished with different abrasive papers and then with Alumina (2 mm)/water slurry on BUEHLER pads, rinsed thoroughly with distilled water and then sonicated in distilled water for 5 minutes. A concentration of GO of 2 mgmL<sup>1</sup> and an applied voltage of 10 V were used for EPD. During EPD, GO film was deposited on Au electrode (anode) which was separated by 3 mm from the Pt electrode (cathode) in a single-compartment cell. Figure 1 shows a schematic illustration of the stepwise hybrid sensor fabrication process. A smooth and homogeneous GO layer was obtained after 15 minutes of deposition. High quality electrochemically reduced graphene oxide (ERGO) nanosheets were prepared by electrochemical reduction of EPD-GO at 1.3 V in 0.1 M PBS for 15 minutes. The color of the prepared ERGO film was black.

#### 2.4 Preparation of AuNPs/ERGO/Au Modified Electrode

Further modification of ERGO/Au electrode with AuNPs was achieved by applying 0.4 V constant potential in 0.1 M KNO3 solution containing 6 mM HAuCl4 for 5 minutes. After thoroughly rinsed with water, the AuNPs/ ERGO/Au modified electrode was ready to be tested as a sensor for hydrazine.

# 3 Results and Discussion

# 3.1 Characterization of ERGO and AuNPs/ERGO Nanocomposites

The morphology of AuNPs on ERGO layer was characterized by SEM. The effect of the electrodeposition conditions on the morphology of AuNPs was examined for two different electrodeposition methods: Potentiostatic electrodeposition from 0.2 mM HAuCl4 solution at 0.4 V for two different times (2.5 and 5 minutes) and potentiodynamic cycling for 60 cycles. The potential applied here (0.4 V) for the electrodeposition of AuNPs has previously been proved to form metallic Au(0) deposits and this applied potential is sufficiently negative to reduce any gold oxide [40]. Figure 2 shows the SEM images of AuNPs on ERGO/Cu substrate at different magnifications. First, it is clear that the ERGO layer is intrinsically corrugated and wavy, see Figure 2a, d, g. Second, the AuNPs were successfully grown on the surface of ERGO film with a quasi-spherical shape. From the zoom-in images (Figure 2c, f, e), the ordered monodispersed AuNPs are clearly visible and an influence of the preparation conditions on the size of the deposited AuNPs is observed. The particles formed under the aforementioned conditions have a narrow size distribution and the average size of AuNPs is 50 nm for the particles deposited for 2.5 minutes and is 40 nm for those deposited for 5 minutes, but the particles deposited by cyclic voltammetry CV of 60 cycles are larger (80 nm) and start to nucleate as double particles Figure 2i.

FT-IR spectroscopy was also used to investigate the quality of the produced graphene and to assess the extent

of removing the oxygen-containing groups from ERGO films, which can be used as a measure of the quality of the prepared ERGO films. Figure 3 shows the FT-IR absorption spectra of (a) the as-synthesized GO, (b) the electrophoretically deposited GO (EPD-GO), (c) the electrochemically reduced GO (ERGO) and (d) the AuNPs/ ERGO surfaces. The oxygen-containing functional groups of GO were revealed by the bands at 1225, 1390, 1750 and 3150–3250 cm<sup>1</sup> , which correspond to CO stretching vibrations (epoxy or alkoxy), COH peak (carboxyl), CO stretching peak and OH broad coupling of COOH groups, respectively [28]. The peak at 1620 cm<sup>1</sup> can be assigned to the skeletal vibrations of unoxidized graphitic domains. All these signals of the oxygen-containing functional groups are observable in the FT-IR spectrum of GO and they decrease in EPD-GO, indicating that there is still functionalization of the GO, Figure 3a and b. As EPD-GO is electrochemically reduced, the absorption bands of oxygen functionalities almost disappear (Figure 3c); demonstrating that high quality ERGO is

achieved by using the electrochemical approach. Also, when AuNPs were deposited on ERGO film, all peaks of oxygen-containing groups are vanished (Figure 3d).

## 3.2 Electrochemical Behavior of AuNPs/ERGO/Au Electrode towards Hydrazine Oxidation

The electrocatalytic oxidation of hydrazine at different modified electrodes based on graphene and AuNPs has been investigated using cyclic voltammetry. Figure 4 shows the electrochemistry of 5 mM hydrazine/0.1 M PBS/pH 8 at different working electrodes AuNPs/ERGO/ Au, AuNPs/Au, ERGO/Au and bare Au. At bare Au electrode (curve a), the electrooxidation of hydrazine requires a large overpotential (+0.461 V) and results in a low anodic current (96.9 mA) with absence of a cathodic peak, indicating an irreversible heterogeneous charge transfer in this system. The oxidation peak is rather broad due to the slow electron transfer kinetics. The CV obtained at AuNPs/Au electrode (curve b) exhibited a lower overpotential (peak potential of 0.210 V) with a negative shift of 0.251 V and a higher current of 163 mA (1.7-fold increase) compared to bare Au electrode. This might be attributed to the uniform distribution and large surface area of AuNPs deposited onto Au substrate and to their electrocatalytic activity. When Au substrate is modified with ERGO film, 1.6-fold increase in the oxidation current compared to bare Au electrode is observed. A remarkable negative shift of potential of 0.354 V compared to bare Au electrode is noticed (peak potential is 0.107 V and peak current is 151 mA), as shown in curve c. This proves that the unique planar structure of ERGO plays a key role in the catalytic improvement at the ERGO/Au electrode. The interesting remarkable performance of ERGO/Au electrode towards hydrazine oxidation may be also correlated with the high quality of

the sp<sup>2</sup> conjugated bonds in the carbon lattice which leads to a highly conductive ERGO film. Also, the unusual density of electronic states of ERGO affects its electrochemical reactivity [41]. The interaction between the nonbonding electrons of hydrazine and the p-electrons of ERGO made the electron transfer process faster.

Further modification of ERGO/Au electrode was achieved by electrodeposition of AuNPs onto the outermost ERGO layer. A well-defined sharp oxidation peak for hydrazine was observed at lower potential of 0.087 V on AuNPs/ERGO/Au modified electrode with a negative potential shift of 0.380 V and two-fold increase in peak current compared to the bare Au electrode, as shown in curve d. The increase of current response is probably due to enhanced electron transfer kinetics and it may also be generated from surface accumulation of electroactive species [42]. Also, it is observed that the electrocatalytic activity of AuNPs/ERGO/Au modified system is higher than that of AuNPs/Au system. This is due to the homogenous distribution of AuNPs on the flat ERGO film which made a considerable decrease of the peak potential to +87 mV. Furthermore, the synergistic interaction between AuNPs and ERGO enhanced the electrocatalytic activity of the proposed AuNPs/ERGO/Au sensor towards hydrazine oxidation.

The possible origins of the enhanced performance and catalytic activity of the AuNPs/ERGO/Au modified electrode are summarized in the following points: i) The planar geometry of ERGO film provides large amount of anchoring active sites for electrodeposition of AuNPs onto it, preventing the aggregation of nanosized gold particles. ii) The uniform distribution of AuNPs on the surface of ERGO film creates more active sites through their direct integration with ERGO at the phase boundaries where the catalytic reaction preferably occurs [30]. iii) The highly conductive ERGO allows excessive active sites for AuNPs nucleation, increasing the electron transfer rate significantly, which would greatly increase the electrocatalytic activity of the AuNPs/ERGO/Au modified electrode.

#### 3.3 Effect of Solution pH

The impact of the pH of the supporting electrolyte on the electro-oxidation of hydrazine is explored at AuNPs/ ERGO/Au in 5 mM hydrazine/0.1 M PBS with different pH values of 5 to 11. The results indicate that the anodic peak current (Ipa) increases remarkably with increasing the pH from 5 to 8 and then the peak current decreases with increasing the pH from 8 to 11, as shown in Figure 5B. It is also noticed that the anodic peak potential is shifted positively along with the decrease of pH, as shown in Figure 5A, indicating a higher oxidation overpotential occurred at lower pH values. Since the pKa of hydrazine is 7.9, the decrease in peak current at pH values lower than the pKa is attributed to the protonation of hydrazine. The protonated form in solutions with pH values lower than 8 is subjected to a similar electrical field

at the positively charged electrode surface. At pH near pKa, the neutral form of hydrazine predominates, leading to an increase of the peak current. However, at pH values above the pKa, the peak current decreases due to the deprotonation of hydrazine. Thus, pH 8 in PBS was chosen for the determination of hydrazine.

# 3.4 Elucidation of the Mechanism and Kinetics

To get an insight into the mechanism of hydrazine oxidation, the influence of potential scan rate is investigated. The scan rate is varied from 10 to 400 mV s<sup>1</sup> using CV in a solution containing 5 mM hydrazine/0.1 M PBS at AuNPs/ERGO/Au modified electrode, as depicted in Figure 6A. The results show that the peak current Ipa is proportional to the square root of scan rate (n1/2) in the range of 10–400 mV s<sup>1</sup> , Ipa(A)=2.86 <sup>3</sup> 10<sup>5</sup>+3.40 <sup>3</sup> 10<sup>4</sup> n1/2 (V1/2 s 1/2), (R<sup>2</sup>=0.997), suggesting a diffusion-controlled kinetics, as shown in Figure 6C. Additionally, the oxidation peak potential (Epa) is shifted to more positive

Fig. 6. (A) CVs obtained at AuNPs/ERGO/Au electrode in 0.1 M PBS (pH 8) containing 5 mM hydrazine at various scan rates of 10 (a), 20 (b), 30 (c), 50 (d), 70 (e), 150 (f), 200 (g), 250 (h), 300 (i), 350 (j), 400 (k) mV s<sup>1</sup> , (B) Plot of Ep versus log n and (C) Plot of Ipa versus n1/2.

potentials as the scan rate increases. Also, a linear relationship between Epa and log (n) is obtained (Figure 6B), indicating that the oxidation of hydrazine is a totally irreversible electrode process. In order to get more information on the rate determining step, a plot of Epa versus log (n) is constructed. The results of this plot show a straight line with a slope (b) of 162 mV/decade, b= 2.3RT/(1a) naF, (R2=0.953), (assuming na=1 and a= 0.52) [42], suggesting that the rate determining step in hydrazine oxidation reaction is a one-electron transfer process. Our results and conclusions on the mechanism and kinetics of hydrazine oxidation are in excellent agreement with different modified electrodes mentioned in literature [43].

The number of electrons transferred (n) in the overall reaction is obtained according to the following equation for a totally irreversible diffusion-controlled processes [44].

$$I_p = 3.01 \times 10^5 \ n [(1{-}\alpha) \, n_\alpha]^{1/2} A C_h D^{1/2} \ \nu^{1/2}$$

Where A=0.0177 cm<sup>2</sup> is the electrode surface area, Ch=5 <sup>3</sup> 10<sup>6</sup> mol cm<sup>3</sup> is the hydrazine concentration and D is the diffusion coefficient. Taking D=2.5 3 10<sup>5</sup> cm<sup>2</sup> s 1 , a=0.52 [42] and from the slope of the plot of Ipa vs. n1/2, the total number of electrons (n) involved in the oxidation of hydrazine is four.

Although the mechanism of hydrazine oxidation depends significantly on the electrolyte solution and the nature of the electrode, the following mechanism was previously suggested: [3b]

$$N_2H_4 + H_2O \rightarrow N_2H_3 + H_3O^+ + e^-$$
 (slow)

$$N_2H_3 + 3 H_2O \rightarrow N_2 + 3 H_3O^+ + 3 e^-$$
 (fast)

The rate determining step is the first one-electron transfer process, which is followed by a three-electron transfer process yielding N2 as the final product. Therefore, the overall hydrazine oxidation reaction leads to the formation of environmentally friendly products as N2 and water as follows:

$$N_2H_4 + 4~H_2O \rightarrow N_2 + 4~H_3O^+ + 4~e^-$$

## 3.5 Analytical Performance for Detection of Hydrazine

Under the optimum conditions, the oxidation peak currents of various hydrazine concentrations at the AuNPs/ERGO/Au modified electrode were recorded by differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) in static solutions, as shown in Figure 7. Well-defined voltammograms were obtained. The anodic peak currents increased with increasing hydrazine concentration from 0.8– 8000 mM (from curve a to curve p). The inset of Figure 7 shows the plot of Ipa versus hydrazine concentration (Ch). This plot

DPVs obtained at AuNPs/ERGO/Au electrode in various hydrazine concentrations in 0.1 M PBS (pH 8) (a p): 8 3 10<sup>7</sup> , 2 3 10<sup>6</sup> , 4 3 10<sup>6</sup> , 6 3 10<sup>6</sup> , 1 3 10<sup>5</sup> , 8 3 10<sup>5</sup> , 1 3 10<sup>4</sup> , 2 3 10<sup>4</sup> , 4 3 10<sup>4</sup> , 6 3 10<sup>4</sup> , 8 3 10<sup>4</sup> , 1 3 10<sup>3</sup> , 2 3 10<sup>3</sup> , 4 3 10<sup>3</sup> , 6 3 10<sup>3</sup> , 8 3 10<sup>3</sup> M.

consists of two linear segments with different slopes. A sensitivity of 26 mAmM<sup>1</sup> in the range of 0.8– 1000 mM and a sensitivity of 2.79 mAmM<sup>1</sup> in the range of 2000– 8000 mM were observed. Two slopes were previously reported [42], which may be attributed to the change in the surface catalytic reaction conditions arising from generation of N2 bubbles on the active sites or different adsorption rates. At low hydrazine concentrations, the formed N2 bubbles are not sufficient to completely hinder the diffusion of hydrazine towards the electrode surface. While when hydrazine concentration increases, N2 evolution is rather vigorous at the active sites such that it reduces the rate of diffusion, resulting in a decrease in current signal.

The linear response obtained at low hydrazine concentrations is used to construct a hydrazine sensor. The limit of detection (LOD) of hydrazine by this sensor is 74 nM as calculated from the relation, LOD=3 3 SD/slope, where SD is the standard deviation of the current response values. The performance and figures of merits for AuNPs/ERGO/Au sensor are compared with previously reported modified electrodes for determination of hydrazine, as shown in Table 1. The proposed modified electrode shows excellent performance and sensing characteristics. It can be seen that the AuNPs/ERGO/Au modified electrode exhibits a lower or comparable detection limit, high sensitivity and wide concentration range, suggesting the suitability of the proposed sensor for nanomolar detection of hydrazine with high performance. Although some previous reports claimed a lower detection limit [45], their values were derived from the signal/ noise ratio of 3 method, which is based on the background signal rather than the analyte signal, neglecting issues related to detectable Faradaic currents of the analyte at

very low concentrations for example multiple peaks [3c]. The high performance of the AuNPs/ERGO/Au modified electrode can be attributed to the synergistic effect between the nano-structured ERGO sheets and the monodispersed AuNPs, as discussed before. The whole volume of ERGO is probably exposed to surface adsorbates, maximizing their surface concentration and thus resulting in a higher current. In addition, ERGO is highly conductive and can effectively transfer electrons between Au electrode and AuNPs and thus increases the rate of charge transport and prevents the electrode from fouling.

## 3.6 Stability and Reproducibility of the Sensor

The stability of AuNPs/ERGO/Au modified electrode was also examined by monitoring the current response after successive cycling of the modified electrode in the potential range of 0.3 V to +0.9 V in 5 mM hydrazine in PBS (pH 8). It was found that the peak current for hydrazine oxidation retained 93.7% of its initial value and no obvious shift in potential was observed after 65 successive cycles. The storage ability of the modified electrode was also tested. It was found that the sensor retained about 76% of its initial response after daily use for 4 days and stored in 0.1 M PBS at 10 8C when it is not in use. Therefore, this sensor can be reused for long time. The reasonable stability of the modified electrode might be related to the graphene matrix which increases the effective surface area for assembling and enhancing the activity of gold nanoparticles.

To investigate the reproducibility of the proposed sensor, four similar and independently fabricated electrodes were used in 5 mM hydrazine. A relative standard deviation (RSD) of the current responses was 7.2%. Thus, the present sensor exhibits reasonable stability, antifouling ability and reproducibility for hydrazine detection.

#### 3.7 Interference Studies

The effect of various substances, as potential interference compounds, on the determination of hydrazine was studied. Nitrogen-containing compounds such as nitrate often accompany with hydrazine in the nitrogen cycle process and also in a variety of industrial processes. Possible interferences for the determination of 10<sup>4</sup> M hydrazine in PBS (pH 8) at the proposed sensor were investigated by adding various foreign species to the solution. The results showed that no interference was observed with common cations and anions (100-fold quantities of K<sup>+</sup>, Na<sup>+</sup>, Ca2<sup>+</sup>, Mg2<sup>+</sup>, NO3 , CO3 <sup>2</sup>, SO4 2 and Cl) and 100-fold quantities of tartaric acid, citric acid, oxalic acid, acetic acid and succinic acid. The deviation of the determination was within 6%, indicating the good selectivity of the sensor.

# 3.8 Application to Real Sample Analysis: Spiked Water

In order to evaluate the validity of the proposed method for the determination of hydrazine in real samples, tap water samples were tested. Contamination of drinking water with hydrazine can originate from wastewater treatment plant effluents and industrial waste. In particular, hydrazine can be formed in drinking water under certain conditions as a by-product of the chloramination process, which is used in some water treatment plants and its potential formation under conventional chlorination techniques is not excluded [46]. Therefore, detection of hydrazine in real drinking water samples is of environmental and health importance. Here, three tap water samples were spiked with different concentrations of hydrazine and were analyzed using the proposed electrode. The results are shown in Table 2. The recovery results are satisfactory and prove that the proposed sensor may be a potential candidate for the determination of hydrazine in real samples.

# 4 Conclusions

In summary, a green and fast electrochemical approach to the synthesis of high quality graphene nanosheets is reported: The as-synthesized GO was deposited on the electrode surface by EPD method and then was electrochemically reduced to yield high quality ERGO film. This method is simple and does not result in contamination of the produced graphene. Monodispersed AuNPs were deposited on ERGO film by electrodeposition method and the modified electrode was characterized by SEM and FT-IR techniques. The electrochemical sensor based on AuNPs/ERGO/Au electrode was successfully tested for nanomolar detection of hydrazine. The AuNPs/ERGO/Au electrode showed high electrocatalytic activity towards hydrazine oxidation with remarkably lower overpotential of 87 mV, which is due to the synergistic effect between graphene and AuNPs. A reasonable low detection limit of 74 nM, wide linear range of detection, anti-interference ability, good stability and repeatability make this composite as a potential candidate for the future development of hydrazine sensors. Also, the proposed fabrication strategy is useful for preparing other high quality graphene-based nanocomposites and electrocatalysts and thus it provides a simple approach that may be used in several fields such as catalysis, sensors, fuel cells and batteries.

**Hydrazine oxidation reaction coupled with hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is an effective strategy to achieve low energy water splitting for hydrogen production. In order to realize the application of hydrazine-assisted HER system, researchers have been focusing on the development of electrocatalysts with integrated dual active sites, while the performance under high current density is still unsatisfying. In this work, hierarchical Ohmic contact interface engineering is designed and used as a bridge between the NiMo and Ni2P heterojunction toward industrial current density applications, with the charge transfer impedance greatly eliminated via such a pathway with low energy barrier. As a proof-of-concept, the importance of charge redistribution and energy barrier at the Ohmic contact interface is investigated by significantly reducing the voltage of overall hydrazine splitting (OHzS) at high current density. Intriguingly, the NiMo/Ni2P hierarchical Ohmic contact heterojunction can drive current densities of 100 and 500 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> with only 181 and 343 mV cell voltage in the OHzS electrolyzer with high electrocatalytic stability. The proposed hierarchical Ohmic contact interface engineering paves new avenue for hydrogen production with low energy consumption.**

**1. Introduction**

Water splitting electrocatalysis is one of the most efficient methods for producing high-purity "green hydrogen."[\[1–3\]](#page-10-0) However, the high thermodynamic potential (1.23 V) of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) results in high energy consumption of water splitting, which limits its further application. Intense attempts have been attracted to replace the anodic

OER with small molecule oxidation by combining with hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), such as the oxidation reactions of urea,[\[4–6\]](#page-10-0) glycerol,[\[7–9\]](#page-10-0) methanol,[\[10–12\]](#page-10-0) 5-hydroxymethylfurfural,[\[13\]](#page-10-0) xylose,[\[14\]](#page-10-0) and glucose, thus reducing the overall operating voltage of the electrolyzer.[\[15\]](#page-10-0) Among them, hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) has a significantly lower theoretical oxidation potential (−0.33 V).[\[16\]](#page-10-0) Moreover, the only production of hydrazine oxidation is N2, which is nontoxic and stable,[\[17\]](#page-10-0) demonstrating its unique advantages in high efficiency and security.

Generally, electrocatalysts for hydrazineassisted HER mainly focuses on the development of dual-functionality. For instances, by integrating MoNi4 and NiCo with large amounts of active sites for HER and HzOR, respectively, Zhang et al. achieved a high current density of 250 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> driven at a cell voltage of 0.63 V.[\[18\]](#page-10-0) Huang et al. used the interfacial electric field to simultaneously couple nucleophilic sites for

HER and the electrophilic sites for HzOR together within the heterojunction, and drove the current density of 10 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> at a voltage of 0.037 V.[\[19\]](#page-10-0) Bifunctional catalysts have promoted the application of hydrazine-assisted HER, but up to date, they have seldom reached the standard of high current density required for industrial hydrogen production (≈500 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2).[\[20\]](#page-10-0) More satisfying performance should be achieved for bifunctional electrocatalysts applied at large current density. To achieve this target, first, fast electron transfer and high catalytic activity of the electrocatalysts at high current density should be maintained. Second, the stability and robustness of the catalysts should be satisfied during long term operation. Finally, rapid bubble desorption is expected to be obtained to prevent active sites being covered from quantity gas production.[\[21,22\]](#page-11-0)

In order to address the above issues, different active sites have been integrated at the Ohmic contact interface to drive large current density of hydrazine-assisted HER at low voltage. In metalsemiconductor (M–S) junctions, the low interfacial energy barrier induced by Ohmic contact can greatly eliminate the resistance of charge transfer in the catalysis process,[\[23,24\]](#page-11-0) thus creating high-speed transfer paths for charges without additional energy loss.[\[25,26\]](#page-11-0) The low energy barrier is one of the most unique properties that distinguishes Ohmic contact from the other form of contact in the M–S junction, that is, the Schottky contact. The **[www.advancedsciencenews.com](http://www.advancedsciencenews.com) [www.advmat.de](http://www.advmat.de)**

built-in electric field (BIEF) and local charge concentration due to the rectifying interface make Schottky contact widely used in electrocatalysts. However, the reverse BIEF might weaken the effective injection of electrons, which can be inferred from the rectification effect. Moreover, the synergy brought by high energy barrier might introduce the competitive effects in electrocatalysis process, since the large energy barrier may weaken the contribution of Gibbs free energy to catalytic activity.[\[27,28\]](#page-11-0) Therefore, Ohmic contact with low energy barrier is more suitable for acting as a bridge to integrate the active sites, which will effectively promote the further application of hydrazine-assisted HER catalysts. Whereas, the applications of Ohmic contact in heterojunction electrocatalysts are rarely reported and limited to single half reactions.

In this work, to further explore the properties and application of Ohmic contact engineering, a 3D hierarchical Ohmic contact heterojunction is fabricated by hydrothermalphosphating-electrodeposition method. NiMo alloy works as the metallic phase, while Ni2P is the n-type narrow-bandgap semiconductor,[\[29,30\]](#page-11-0) which function as active sites for HER and HzOR, respectively. Herein, an Ohmic contact interface of NiMo- Ni2P heterojunction with the following advantages is constructed: i) The 3D hierarchical structure exposes a large number of active sites, ii) the optimized surface properties and nanoarry structure promote electrolyte penetration and bubble desorption, respectively, iii) charge redistribution and interfacial electron accumulation are driven by work function differences, resulting in optimized free energy and enhanced charge transfer. To this end, the reasonably designed NiMo/Ni2P Ohmic contact heterostructure reveals excellent performances in both HER and HzOR. For HER, the potentials at 10 and 500 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> correspond to −15 and −195 mV, respectively. As for HzOR, it requires only −17 and 114 mV to drive current densities of 10 and 500 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2. When it is integrated into a two-electrode electrolyzer, it can drive large current density water splitting at very low operating voltage with excellent durability. Typically, at current densities of 100 and 500 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2, the overall hydrazine splitting (OHzS) requires cell voltages of only 181 and 343 mV, providing reliable insights for the design of Ohmic contact electrocatalysts, paving the avenue for the application of OhzS in the near future.

#### **2. Results and Discussion**

The Ohmic contact is constructed by matching the electronic structures, including energy band positions and work functions of metal, semiconductor and M–S junction. A multistep synthesis method was adopted to establish a clear heterojunction interface, which is shown in **Figure 1**[a.](#page-2-0) The contrast samples were pure Ni2P nanosheet arrays (NSAs), NiMo alloy directly grown on nickel foam, NiMo alloy grown on Ni2P NSAs and pure NiMo deposited at the same voltage (Figure S1, Supporting Information). As shown in Figure [1b,](#page-2-0) the electronic structures of NiMo and Ni2P were characterized by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS). The curve at low energy onset regions verifies the metallic properties of NiMo, while Ni2P shows semiconducting properties. The intercept with the binding energy axis indicates that the valance band edge of Ni2P is 1.9 eV away from the Fermi level. Furthermore, the work functions of Ni2P and NiMo were determined according to the secondary electron cutoff edge at high energy onset regions. The binding energies corresponding to the cutoff edges of Ni2P and NiMo is 16.7 and 17.1 eV, respectively. The position of work function relative to the vacuum level was calculated according to the formula of *W*<sup>f</sup> = 21.22-*E*cutoff. As a result, the work function of NiMo is −4.12 eV(vs Vac.), while that of Ni2P is −4.52 eV (vs Vac.). It turns out that charge redistribution occurs when the contact is formed between NiMo and Ni2P, and the driving force is the difference of work functions (ΔΦ).[\[31\]](#page-11-0) ΔΦ induces the electrons spontaneously transferring from the low work function medium to the higher one,[\[32\]](#page-11-0) until Fermi level on both sides of the heterojunction moves to a consistent equilibrium position and stabilizes the system energy.[\[33\]](#page-11-0) Herein, ΔΦ triggers electron transfer from NiMo to Ni2P side, and band bending occurs on the semiconductor surface due to the injection of major carriers. Band bending before and after charge transfer is investigated through Mott−Schottky curve and XPS valence band spectrum. Mott−Schottky curve of pure Ni2P (Figure [1c\)](#page-2-0) and NiMo/Ni2P (Figure S2, Supporting Information) are tested in 0.5 m Na2SO4. In Figure [1c,](#page-2-0) the intersection of the fitted plots under different frequencies is −0.62 V (V vs Ag/AgCl), where the conduction band position can be calculated as −4.31 eV (vs Vac.). Moreover, all the fitted plots show positive slopes, reflecting that Ni2P is an n-type semiconductor,[\[34\]](#page-11-0) which can also be deduced from the position of Fermi level tested through UPS spectra. Figure [1d](#page-2-0) displays the changes of flat band potential before and after heterojunction formation. There is a shift compared with the curve of pure Ni2P, which can also be observed in XPS valence band spectrum (Figure S3, Supporting Information), indicating the energy band bend downward due to the interaction of NiMo alloy and Ni2P.[\[35\]](#page-11-0)

According to the work function and conduction valence band characterized above, a reliable band structure model is established before contact in Figure [1e,](#page-2-0) where the band structure of Ni2P is in proximity to that of the already reported Ni2P semiconductor.[\[30\]](#page-11-0) When NiMo is loaded with Ni2P, the ΔΦ causes the charge transfer and energy band bending. The model is converted to classic Ohmic contact illustrated in Figure [1f.](#page-2-0) [\[36\]](#page-11-0) The accumulated electrons on the Ohmic contact interface cause the resistance of the surface to be much lower than that of the semiconductor itself, creating a pathway with low barrier for the electrons moving in any direction without the influence of rectification effect. In addition, NiMo and Ni2P have demonstrated excellent performances in HER[\[37\]](#page-11-0) and HzOR,[\[38\]](#page-11-0) respectively. Through the integration at the Ohmic contact interface, NiMo and Ni2P are expected to realize bifunctionality, as shown in Figure [1g.](#page-2-0)

The morphologies of NiMo, Ni2P, and NiMo/Ni2P were presented by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The pure NiMo coating is formed by compact packing of NiMo alloy particles, and only the active sites on the coating surface are exposed (**Figure 2**[a\)](#page-3-0). Figure [2b](#page-3-0) shows the Ni2P NSAs, whose morphology is inherited from its precursor (Figure S4, Supporting Information). In Figure [2c,](#page-3-0) Ni2P is used as substrate for nucleation and growth of NiMo alloy particles. The NiMo particles are uniformly loaded on the Ni2P NSAs by electrodeposition under the same conditions. A hierarchical structure is fabricated on the basis of the 3D Ni2P NSAs. X-ray diffraction (XRD) shows that Ni2P remains the same after loading NiMo particles (Figure S5, Supporting Information) and the diffraction signal of NiMo alloy is not

observed in XRD patterns. This is probably due to the fact that Mo exists as a solid solution in the lattice of Ni,[\[39\]](#page-11-0) which is covered by the strong signal of nickel foam substrate. The formation of heterostructure was further verified via high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). It shows the interplanar crystal distances of 0.20 and 0.34 nm corresponding to Ni (111) crystal planes (Figure [2d\)](#page-3-0) and Ni2P (001) planes (Figure [2e\)](#page-3-0). Moreover, different crystal planes appear simultaneously on both sides of the heterojunction surface corresponding to NiMo and Ni2P, respectively (Figure [2f\)](#page-3-0). The elemental mapping presented by high-angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF–STEM) showed that Ni, Mo, and P existed simultaneously on the surface of the nanosheet, which confirmed the successful growth of NiMo on the surface of Ni2P (Figure [2g\)](#page-3-0). In order to eliminate the influence of Ni species in Ni2P, after separating the phosphide and alloy by acid treatment, the ratio of Ni and Mo is measured by Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometry (ICP-OES), which is determined to be 3:1 (Table S1, Supporting Information).

The chemical composition and valence states of each element were further analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). As shown in Figure S6 (Supporting Information), XPS survey

spectrum shows that NiMo/Ni2P contains typical Ni 2p, Mo 3d, and P 2p peaks, which proves the growth of NiMo on the Ni2P surface. O 1s peak indicates the formation of P─O bonds or amorphous oxide layers at strong oxyphilic sites in phosphates,[\[40\]](#page-11-0) while C 1s peak indicates the adsorption of foreign carbon. The high-resolution Ni 2p spectrum in NiMo/Ni2P is deconvolved by several prominent peaks, as shown in Figure 2h. The two signals at 852.31 and 869.48 eV correspond to Ni<sup>0</sup> 2p3/2 and Ni<sup>0</sup> 2p1/2, respectively, while the Ni2<sup>+</sup> peaks are observed at 856.07 and 873.75 eV. The Ni<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> signals are co-contributed by NiMo and Ni2P as they can also be observed separately in comparing samples, indicating the presence of surface oxidation states of Ni in both NiMo[\[41\]](#page-11-0) and Ni2P.[\[42\]](#page-11-0) The Ni<sup>3</sup><sup>+</sup> peak appear at 860.00 and 877.29 eV, accompanied by a pair of wide satellite peaks.[\[43\]](#page-11-0) It can be deduced that Ni3<sup>+</sup> peaks appeared in NiMo/Ni2P are all contributed by Ni2P according to Ni 2p signals. It is worth

noting that the Ni 2p signal in the heterojunction has different extent of binding energy shift compared with the pure component. NiMo moves toward the high binding energy direction, while Ni2P toward the opposite direction, indicating a continuous charge transfer at the interfaces, and electrons transfer from NiMo to Ni2P. Besides, The Ni0 signal is also observed in Ni2P. It is supposed to be contributed by nickel foam, since no Ni0 signal is found when removing the substrate (Figure S7, Supporting Information). As to Mo 3d, the deconvolution peaks at 227.07 and 230.31 eV correspond to Mo0, while the signals at 228.24 and 234.86 eV are attributed to Mo4<sup>+</sup>, and the remaining two peaks are derived from Mo<sup>6</sup><sup>+</sup>. Similar high-resolution spectrum is only observed in NiMo, while no Mo signal appears in Ni2P, which further indicates that all the signal of Mo 3d is from NiMo alloy, and the high valence signal can be attributed from oxidation state in air.[\[44\]](#page-11-0) Binding energy shift also occurs in Mo 3d orbit, and the peak intensity of high-valence signal increases, which also confirms that the alloy side is losing electrons. The deconvolution peak of P 2p can be fitted to P 2p3/2, P 2p1/2, and P─O bond at 128.63, 129.53, and 133.88 eV, respectively. The P 2p orbit signal is provided by Ni2P independently with the charge transfer occurring at the P site. It is summarized from previous results that an Ohmic interface introduces electron transfer from NiMo to Ni2P, and there is a strong interface coupling interaction between them.

The electrochemical properties of hydrogen evolution were investigated in a three-electrode system with a saturated calomel electrode (SCE), a graphite rod as the reference electrode and counter electrode. The loading mass of NiMo/Ni2P catalyst was 1.02 mg cm<sup>−</sup>2. The Ohmic contact heterojunction demonstrates the best HER performance at 1 m KOH. As shown in **Figure 3**a, the HER overpotentials of NiMo/Ni2P are 15, 81, and 195 mV, corresponds to current densities of 10, 100, and 500 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2, respectively. Low overpotential is also maintained at high current density, such as 282 mV under 1000 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> (Figure S8, Supporting Information). Compared with Ni2P and NiMo, the performance of Ohmic contact heterojunction with interface effect is significantly improved. The overpotential of NiMo/Ni2P is very close to that of commercial Pt/C at low current densities and much better than that at high current densities. The direct effect of introducing heterogeneous interfaces is to increase the number of exposed active sites, which can be verified through **[www.advancedsciencenews.com](http://www.advancedsciencenews.com) [www.advmat.de](http://www.advmat.de)**

capacitance of double layer (*C*dl) calculated according to cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves (Figure S9, Supporting Information). Figure [3b](#page-4-0) shows a large electrochemical active area of pure NiMo, and the calculated *C*dl of NiMo is 34.61 mF cm<sup>−</sup>2. The existence of heterojunction activated or produced more active sites, which can be judged from the increasing of *C*dl in NiMo/Ni2P. It reaches 47.82 mF cm<sup>−</sup>2, which is larger than any comparing samples. However, the contribution of Ni2P to the active area is almost absent since the *C*dl of Ni2P is only 6.61 mF cm<sup>−</sup>2. The electrochemical surface area (ECSA) of NiMo and NiMo/Ni2P were further calculated, and the polarization curves were normalized, as shown in Figure [3c.](#page-4-0) For both the ECSA-corrected LSV curve and initial one, the NiMo/Ni2P requires lower overpotential to obtain the same current density, indicating that the intrinsic activity of the active site was also improved.

The Tafel slope was measured to characterize HER kinetics. By fitting the linear part of the Tafel plots, as shown in Figure [3d,](#page-4-0) the Tafel slope of NiMo/Ni2P is determined to be 29.45 mV dec<sup>−</sup>1, which is close to that of commercial Pt/C. In this case, its possible mechanism is Volmer–Tafel one.[\[45\]](#page-11-0) Furthermore, it is much smaller than the 87.54 and 79.11 mV dec<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> corresponding to Ni2P and NiMo. Moreover, Tafel slope around 100 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> is also collected (Figure S10, Supporting Information), and NiMo/Ni2P shows smaller slope even though compared to Pt/C, which means better kinetics of Ohmic contact under large current density. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) spectra at the same potential are collected in Figure [3e.](#page-4-0) The high charge transfer resistance (*R*ct) of Ni2P indicates larger charge transfer impedance, while the *R*ct of NiMo/Ni2P is significantly reduced. In other words, ΔΦ drives charge redistribution at the active site. The charge redistribution introduced a low barrier Ohmic contact interface, optimized electronic structure and rapid electron transfer, thus leading to an improved catalytic activity. The fitted EIS spectra and its equivalent circuit is shown in Figure S11 (Supporting Information). On the contrary, NiMo loaded directly on nickel foam still results a large impedance since the metal–metal contact interface between NiMo and Ni shows tiny ΔΦ and lacks additional interfacial electron accumulation. It is important to note that the overpotential, Tafel slope, and impedance of NiMo alloy for comparison, are close to those of reported NiMo alloy prepared by electrodeposition.[\[46\]](#page-11-0)

NiMo/Ni2P in 1 m KOH displays satisfying stability, as no decline can be observed between the polarization curves tested before and after 5000 cycles of repeated CV scanning (Figure [3f\)](#page-4-0). The long-time operation durability was further investigated through multistep chronopotentiometry in Figure [3g.](#page-4-0) The samples maintained high stability at the cathodic current densities of 10, 100, and 500 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2, with almost no attenuation being observed during 60 h of continuous testing. The improved surface properties and nanoarry structure ensure the robustness of electrocatalyst at high current density due to rapid bubble releasing. As shown in Figure S12 (Supporting Information), compared with independent NiMo alloy, there are no obvious large volume bubbles attached to the surface of NiMo/Ni2P. The reduced bubble size and weakened bubble attachment can be attributed to the improved surface properties.[\[47\]](#page-11-0) Deduced from the contact angle test results (Figure S13, Supporting Information), NiMo/Ni2P has a hydrophilic and gasophobic surface. Compared with NiMo sample, NiMo/Ni2P shows excellent hydrophilicity and better gasophobicity, which leads to rapid penetration of electrolyte and weaker adhesion of gas production, respectively.[\[39\]](#page-11-0) In addition, due to the existence of nanoarry structure, the bubbles released faster at high current density.[\[22\]](#page-11-0) In conclusion, the improved surface properties and nanoarry structure give NiMo/Ni2P with rapid bubble releasing and dynamic contact between electrolyte and catalyst surface.

The hydrazine oxidation was carried out under the same condition with HER, except that 0.5 m N2H4 was added into 1 m KOH. Ni2P is one of the earliest electrocatalysts used for hydrazine oxidation, so the optimized hydrazine concentration in reported work was selected for comparison.[\[48\]](#page-11-0) Polarization curves of NiMo/Ni2P and comparing samples were tested, as shown in **Figure 4**[a.](#page-6-0) The corresponding potentials of NiMo/Ni2P at 10, 100, and 500 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> are −17, 32, and 114 Mv, respectively. The current density of NiMo/Ni2P at around 100 mV is doubled than that of Ni2P, which means Ohmic contact interface also promotes the HzOR compared with NiMo and Ni2P without heterojunction. Under large current density of 1000 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2, NiMo/Ni2P only requires a low potential of 212 mV (Figure S14, Supporting Information). Importantly, NiMo alloy also contributes to HzOR according to reported works.[\[18,49\]](#page-10-0) Here, NiMo alloy also shows certain catalytic activity, which is similar to the commercial Pt/C, but more inert than Ni2P. Therefore, the excellent HzOR performance can be inferred from the formation of heterogeneous interfaces. This also proves the possibility of integrated bifunctional catalysts to further improve the HzOR performance with the presence of heterogeneous interfaces.

Figure [4b](#page-6-0) shows the difference between HzOR and OER. At the same current density, the activity of NiMo/Ni2P in HzOR is significantly improved in contrast to that in OER, since the theoretical oxidation potential of hydrazine is much lower than OER. Therefore, replacing OER with HzOR can significantly reduce the overall voltage and achieve the effect of low voltage coupling hydrogen production. The HzOR kinetics was then analyzed by Tafel slope. As shown in Figure [4c,](#page-6-0) Ni2P and NiMo have similar Tafel slopes, both lower than those of commercial Pt/C catalysts. However, NiMo/Ni2P has the smallest slope of 35.24 mV dec<sup>−</sup>1, indicating faster reaction kinetics at the heterogeneous interface. Tafel slope around 100 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> also shows the best kinetic of NiMo/Ni2P among contrast samples (Figure S15, Supporting Information). The EIS spectra of the catalyst in 1 m KOH+0.5 m N2H4 were also collected in Figure [4d.](#page-6-0) NiMo/Ni2P has the smallest *R*ct, indicating that the property of rapid charge transfer still exists at the anode. The impedance of NiMo in HER and HzOR is similar. However, the *R*ct of Ni2P in HzOR are significantly smaller than HER, which means that Ni2P is hard to obtain both satisfying HER and HzOR performances. The fitted results and corresponding equivalent circuit is shown in Figure S16 (Supporting Information). Figure [4e](#page-6-0) shows that LSV curve of HER in the electrolyte containing N2H4 is basically consistent with that without N2H4, which proves that the addition of N2H4 is harmless to the reduction process but only promotes the oxidation activity. It also provides the possibility of the bifunctional integrated catalyst. Finally, the stability of NiMo/Ni2P for HzOR was investigated. After 5000 cycles of repeated CV scanning, the polarization curve remained almost the same (Figure [4f\)](#page-6-0). Then, in Figure [4g,](#page-6-0) the chronopotentiometry method was used to test the stability at the current densities of 10, 100, and 500

mA cm<sup>−</sup>2. The curve remained stable in the first 40 h. However, there is an apparent increase of voltage, which can be observed at 500 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2. The inset in Figure 4g shows that refreshing the electrolyte at 50 h quickly returns the voltage to its initial state, indicating that the attenuation at high current density is due to the depletion of hydrazine in the electrolyte. If the electrolyte is not refreshed and the test is carried out at a high current density for a long time, the voltage will slowly increase and quickly change, at which point N2H4 is completely exhausted and OER dominates the anode reaction (Figure S17, Supporting Information).

NiMo/Ni2P is assembled as a symmetric electrolytic cell simultaneously as the cathode and anode. The current density of 500 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> was obtained at a very small voltage, which is much lower than the voltage required for Pt/C couple. NiMo/Ni2P can obtain current densities of 100 and 500 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> at 181 and 343 mV, confirming the feasibility of being a bifunctional electrocatalyst for hydrazine-assisted hydrogen production (**Figure 5**[a\)](#page-7-0). The chronopotentiometry curve shows that the overall stability of the electrolyzer is similar to that of HzOR. The voltage increases slowly due to the rapid consumption of hydrazine, and quickly returns to the initial state after refreshing the electrolyte, revealing that NiMo/Ni2P can also maintain stability during long-time operation in the two-electrode electrolyzer (Figure [5b\)](#page-7-0).

Regardless of HER or HzOR, the XRD patterns of the sample before and after the stability test remain consistent (Figure S18, Supporting Information). The surface morphology of the sample after the catalytic reaction was further observed by SEM. Another nanosheet coating appeared on the initial hierarchical arrays, uniformly covering the surface of NiMo/Ni2P. Such a phenomenon of surface reconstruction similarly appeared in HER (Figure S19, Supporting Information) and HzOR (Figure S20, Supporting Information). In the position where NiMo particles and Ni2P nanosheets can be clearly distinguished, it is found that there are uniformly coated fine nanosheets on the surface of both particles and nanosheets (Figures S19d and S20d, Supporting Information). Therefore, the reconstructed substance may be mainly hydroxide or oxidation of metal species.[\[18\]](#page-10-0) XPS

shows that after HER/HzOR durability test (Figures S21 and S22, Supporting Information), signals of Ni0 and Mo0 in NiMo/Ni2P disappears, where only the high valence peaks are left. Moreover, the peaks of P 2p disappeared, indicating that the reconstruction basically occurred on the surface of metal species, and the signal of P 2p is covered by the nanosheet layer. Above all, it can be inferred that Ohmic contact still exists under the reconstruction layer, and excellent charge transfer within the hierarchical catalyst can be maintained during the stability test without obvious attenuation. Hence, the sputtering XPS was conducted to verify the existence of NiMo (Figures S23 and S24, Supporting Information). Each sputtering etching depth was 10 nm (The depth of etching is converted relative to the standard sample, which is not

the true depth of the sample), and a total of three times of etching were conducted. It is noticed that the Ni0 and Mo0 signals significantly enhanced after etching. The Ni<sup>3</sup><sup>+</sup> signal can also be observed after etching in Ni 2p orbit, which can be inferred to come from Ni2P. The same results were found in both the sample after HER and HzOR stability test, which proves the reservation of Ohmic contact structure.

In general, the electrocatalytic performance of NiMo/Ni2P in hydrazine-assisted HER electrolyzer is excellent and superior to the recently reported bifunctional electrocatalysts (Figure 5c; and Table S2, Supporting Information). Additionally, NiMo/Ni2P also shows excellent HER/HzOR performances compared with recently reported electrocatalysts (Figure S25, Tables S3 and S4,

Supporting Information). The radar map further reveals the superior performance brought by Ohmic contact interface, as shown in Figure [5d.](#page-7-0) The larger the area of the closed loop is, the better the comprehensive electrocatalysis performance is. Obviously, the evaluation criteria of NiMo/Ni2P in HER, HzOR, and OHzS from thermodynamic and kinetic perspectives all show that the Ohmic contact interface plays a significant role in improving the comprehensive catalytic performance. NiMo/Ni2P was furthermore applied for practical occasions, as shown in Figure [5e.](#page-7-0) Commercial solar cell was connected with the electrolyzer with one solar radiation intensity simulated by xenon lamp power. The output voltage of commercial solar cell was only 0.63V, and the lighted bubbles could be seen in the digital photograph. In addition, the formation of bubbles on the surface can also be observed by connecting the self-made lemon battery to the electrolyzer (Figure S26, Supporting Information). Therefore, it is proved that NiMo/Ni2P can drive hydrogen production in elec-

trolyzer under relatively low voltage, which is feasible in practical application.

To unveil the roles of Ohmic contact in promoting HER and HzOR, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were further performed. The electrostatic potential in the heterogeneous structure is shown in **Figure 6**a, which can reflect the ΔΦ between two components. The potential difference indicates the work function of NiMo is higher than that of Ni2P, which is consistent with the UPS results. The charge density diagram in Figure 6a shows that charges are significantly concentrated at the interface. It is confirmed that charge transfer occurs from NiMo to Ni2P and accumulates on the interface, which is in agreement with the result of the binding energy shift of each element in the XPS spectrum. The electrostatic potential difference and electron density distribution can explain the charge redistribution at the interface, and also affect the electronic structure, which is one of the most important factors affecting the Gibbs www.advancedsciencenews.com

free energy ( $\Delta G$ ) of reaction processes. Electron density differences calculation is carried out for identifying active sites. The uneven electron density in NiMo/Ni<sub>2</sub>P is caused by the difference in electronegativity.<sup>[50]</sup> (Figure S27, Supporting Information). Ni atoms in NiMo exhibit the characteristics of electron-rich sites, which can be used as nucleophilic sites to adsorb thermally neutral hydrogen intermediates, [51] while the most electron-lacking Ni atoms in Ni<sub>2</sub>P can be used as electrophilic points, thus promoting the dehydrogenation kinetics of HzOR.<sup>[19]</sup> Therefore, the large electronegativity difference gives NiMo/Ni<sub>2</sub>P the possibility of acting as HER/HzOR bi-functional electrocatalyst, which is consistent with the original hypothesis and experimental results. As shown in Figure 6b, Gibbs free energy diagrams of typical HzOR processes for NiMo, Ni<sub>2</sub>P, and NiMo/Ni<sub>2</sub>P, mainly includes hydrazine molecule adsorption and consecutive dehydrogenation steps ( ${}^*N_2H_4 \rightarrow {}^*N_2H_3 \rightarrow {}^*N_2H_2 \rightarrow {}^*N_2H \rightarrow {}^*N_2$ ). The side view of the adsorption model of different intermediates on the NiMo/Ni<sub>2</sub>P surface is shown at the bottom. It is noteworthy that the adsorption of N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> at all Ni sites is exothermic. The adsorption energy of NiMo/Ni<sub>2</sub>P is 0.352 eV, which is higher than Ni<sub>2</sub>P (0.132 eV) but lower than NiMo (0.512 eV), indicating that the charge redistribution regulates the adsorption strength of hydronium on the catalyst surface. Such a moderate bonding strength between the hydrazine molecule and the catalyst surface benefits the subsequent dehydrogenation step.<sup>[19]</sup> Besides, the \*N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> to \*N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub> process is the rate-determining step (RDS) of the NiMo, which has an energy barrier of 0.257 eV (marked with red), while the RDS at the Ni<sub>2</sub>P surface is determined by the \*N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> to \*N<sub>2</sub>H process, which has an energy barrier of 0.354 eV (marked with green). However, as to NiMo/Ni<sub>2</sub>P, the energy barriers of both processes are significantly reduced (0.205 eV for  ${}^*N_2H_4 \rightarrow {}^*N_2H_3$ , 0.135 eV for  ${}^*N_2H_2 \rightarrow {}^*N_2H$ ). Therefore, it can be determined that the Ohmic contact interface optimizes the Gibbs free energy of HzOR, while the moderate adsorption strength with intermediates and the easier dehydrogenation processes result in higher HzOR activity of the heterojunction. As to HER, the Gibbs free energy of hydrogen intermediates ( $\Delta G_{H^*}$ ) at the active site is one of the criteria to measure HER performance. The closer to zero the  $\Delta G_{\mathrm{H}^*}$  is, the more favorable the hydrogen adsorption/desorption process is, [52] thus showing enhanced reaction kinetics and improved catalytic performance. In Figure 6c, the  $\Delta G_{H^*}$  on NiMo surface is -0.452 eV, indicating that the adsorption of hydrogen on the surface is too strong. After the formation of heterojunction, charge redistribution leads to the decrease of electron density at the active site, thus weakening the adsorption strength. The  $\Delta G_{H*}$  of NiMo/Ni<sub>2</sub>P is the closest to zero, leading to the best HER performance.

Moreover, the DFT calculations were also conducted on reconstructed NiMo/Ni<sub>2</sub>P to further illustrate the synergy in Ohmic contact. As shown in Figure 6b, the hydroxide is suspended on the surface of the metal site according to the previous characterization. The Gibbs free energy of HzOR reaction pathways shows that the RDS is still the  $^*N_2H_4 \rightarrow^*N_2H_3$  process, the same with NiMo/Ni<sub>2</sub>P model, but the energy barrier of this step is slightly increased. Besides, the reconstructed NiMo/Ni<sub>2</sub>P also displays a moderate bonding strength between the  $N_2H_4$  and the catalyst surface. The free energy of hydrogen intermediate adsorption on reconstructed NiMo/Ni<sub>2</sub>P is in proximity to the initial model, because the hydroxides generally promoted dissociation of water

rather than the hydrogen intermediate adsorption.  $^{[53,54]}$  In summary, according to the results of calculations and experiments, it is believed that the excellent performance of NiMo/Ni $_2$ P comes from the free energy optimization brought about by Ohmic contact. The calculation results and stability tests show that the presence of the reconstruction layer does not significantly affect the free energy optimized by Ohmic contact.

The simulation results show that the improvement of catalytic performance comes from the synergy of heterojunction interface optimizing the  $\Delta G$  at the adsorption site. In fact, contribution of  $\Delta G$  to catalytic activity can be strongly affected by energy barrier. Only when energy barrier in electron injection pathway is low enough, can catalytic activity be significantly promoted by optimized  $\Delta G$ . Therefore, the Ohmic contact interface ensures a fast electron transfer and the contribution of  $\Delta G$  to catalytic performance, which can all be attributed to its low energy barrier properties.

To further demonstrate the effect of barrier on electron transfer, the Pt/Ni<sub>2</sub>P heterojunction for comparison was prepared. Pt and NiMo have similar electronic structures. [55] The difference is that Pt metal has a fairly high work function, which is higher than Ni<sub>2</sub>P demonstrated from simulation results (Figure S28, Supporting Information). Similar measurement of *I*–*V* curve was tested to identify Ohmic and Schottky contact characteristic according to reported work. [56,57] Ni<sub>2</sub>P was spin-coated on Pt foil and Ni foil deposited with NiMo alloy, the structure of the devices and I-V curve was shown in Figure \$29 (Supporting Information). Pt/Ni<sub>2</sub>P shows nonlinear *I*–*V* characteristic and NiMo/Ni<sub>2</sub>P shows typical Ohmic behavior, indicating the possible interfacial barrier difference between the prepared NiMo/Ni<sub>2</sub>P and Pt/Ni<sub>2</sub>P electrocatalysts. The energy band structure of M–S junction formed by Pt and Ni<sub>2</sub>P is shown in the diagram (Figure 6d), which is different from that of NiMo/Ni<sub>2</sub>P. Furthermore, direction of electrons transfer between Pt and Ni<sub>2</sub>P is opposite to that of NiMo/Ni<sub>2</sub>P determined from XPS binding energy shift (Figure \$30, Supporting Information). The loss of electrons in the n-type Ni<sub>2</sub>P semiconductor is equivalent to the injection of holes, thus forming the surface positive charge space region. Here, the carriers' types on both sides of the contact interface are different, so the BIEF is generated and the direction points from Ni<sub>2</sub>P toward Pt (Figure S31, Supporting Information). In the cathodic HER reaction, electrons are transferred from the electrode to the surface active sites in the same direction as the BIEF.[58] The accelerated electron transfer promotes the combination of electrons and target species, and HER performance is further improved (Figure S32, Supporting Information). On the contrary, electrons migrate in the opposite direction in anodic HzOR, and the rectification effect of the barrier layer brings a higher energy barrier for electron transfer, resulting in additional energy loss and reduced performance. It can be observed directly with the EIS spectra. As shown in Figure S33 (Supporting Information), the  $R_{ct}$  of Pt/Ni<sub>2</sub>P in HER reaction is the lowest among all samples, while its  $R_{ct}$  is higher than Ni<sub>2</sub>P in HzOR.

Schottky electrocatalysts derived from metal-semiconductor contact play an important role in HER, OER, and other electrocatalytic reactions because of their strong BIEF. However, the effect of the BIEF depends on the direction of electron transfer. BIEF in the opposite direction of electron flow leads to an additional energy loss, [32] just as the restricted performance of

Pt/Ni2P for HzOR. This is why reducing the Schottky barrier between a semiconductor catalyst and a current collector with high work function can significantly improve catalytic activity.[\[59\]](#page-11-0) On the metal-semiconductor interface, Ohmic contact is opposite to Schottky contact, but both of them can drive charge redistribution on the interface through ΔΦ. The difference is that Ohmic contact avoids to introduce the rectification effect. Therefore, it is a low energy barrier interface that allows rapid electron transfer in both cathode and anode reactions (Figure [6d\)](#page-8-0). Driven by the external electric field, the direction of electron movement on cathode and anode is opposite. Only Ohmic contact without rectification effect can provide a low energy barrier channel in both paths of electron movement. The NiMo/Ni2P demonstrates advantages of such a channel according to the improved bifunctional electrocatalytic performances. The origin of low barrier interface can be revealed from the perspective of energy band structure. When Ohmic contact is established, the n-type semiconductor acquires electrons, leading to downward bending of energy band. As a result, an inversion layer is formed with high density of electrons accumulation. Hence, the interface has a high conductivity and there is no obvious energy barrier in any direction of electron mobility. When applied in a catalytic reaction, the interface ensures the rapid transfer of electrons, thus eliminating the charge transfer impedance. If Ohmic contact is used as a bridge connecting HER and HzOR active sites, the path with low barrier should also be bidirectional. Therefore, the integrated active sites on the Ohmic contact interface can maximize effect of optimized free energy, thus promoting the robust operation of HER and HzOR under high current density. In conclusion, the influence of energy barrier on electron transfer can be verified. Compared with Schottky contact, Ohmic contact is more suitable as a bridge connecting different active sites, and the existence of low barrier pathway is more conducive to realizing the "win-win" effect of dual active sites.

#### **3. Conclusion**

In summary, Ohmic contact based NiMo/Ni2P bifunctional electrocatalyst for efficient hydrazine-assisted hydrogen production were prepared. The synergistic effect generated by the hierarchical heterojunction improves the catalytic performance of HER and HzOR, and the low energy barrier of the Ohmic contact interface significantly reduces the electron transfer impedance, so the OHzS with high current density can be driven stably at very low battery voltage in the two-electrode electrolyzer. This study highlights the significant role of Ohmic contact as a bridge connecting dual active sites and provides new strategies for the design of heterojunction electrocatalysts. The as prepared NiMo/Ni2P Ohmic contact heterostructure displays excellent OHzS performances, which can drive 100 and 500 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> current density with 181 and 343 mV. It is expected that the heterojunction designing idea approach based on Ohmic contact will also be useful for other electrochemical applications.

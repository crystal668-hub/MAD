# Atomically dispersed Rh-doped NiFe layered double hydroxides: precise location of Rh and promoting hydrazine electrooxidation properties

Noble metal-based catalysts have sparked huge attention owing to their intriguing activity and selectivity. Revealing the noble metal active sites and keeping them in a form of stable and high loading are crucial to improving the catalytic performance and understanding the reaction mechanism. Herein, a feasible preparation method was used to synthesize a Rh-based ultrathin NiFe layered double hydroxide (Rh/NiFe). The detailed study proved that the existence form of Rh atoms is atomically dispersed. Moreover, extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) with theoretical calculation of X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and density functional theory (DFT) were used to identify at atomic level the precise location and coordination environment of the introduced Rh atoms. It was found that Rh atoms are doped in the LDH layer in a coplanar position with Ni and Fe atoms. With 5.4 wt.% loading amount of Rh, the modified catalyst of Rh/NiFe-5.4 shows an 80 mV lower than unmodified ultrathin NiFe layered double hydroxide (NiFe) towards hydrazine electrooxidation. The XAFS fitting revealed that the doping of Rh atoms results in the distortion of the laminate and then introduces certain defects, which may be contributed to electron transport and thus endows exceptional electrocatalytic performance.

# Introduction

As a key role in the modern chemical industry, heterogeneous catalysts with high performance drive so many important reactions in the process of sustainable energy development and fuel cells<sup>1-3</sup>, such as water-gas shift (WGS) reactions<sup>4</sup>, carbon monoxide oxidation<sup>5</sup>, hydrazine oxidation reaction<sup>6</sup>, *etc.* Noble metals possessing unique electronic structure are widely used in these catalytic reactions, but they still suffer tough issues of scarce reserves and low atomic utilization. To reduce the usage of noble metals, supported noble metal catalysts have attracted considerable interest. In addition, the catalytic activity of some catalysts is also improved due to the synergistic electronic effect and some defects after introducing the noble metals<sup>7-9</sup>. Therefore, combining noble metals with non-noble metals in the right way has been and still is a topic of intensive research to improve the catalytic efficiency and the reaction selectivity.

Metal oxides are proved to be an excellent substrate for supporting noble metals on account of their abundant metal or oxygen vacancies and surface OH groups, which can help to stabilize noble metals <sup>10</sup>. To date, various noble metals were loaded on different oxides such as Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub><sup>11</sup>, FeO<sub>x</sub><sup>4, 5, 12</sup>, SiO<sub>2</sub><sup>13-15</sup>, TiO<sub>2</sub><sup>16, 17</sup> and ZnO<sup>18, 19</sup> by various methods. Layered double

hydroxides (LDHs) are a class of lamellar 2D clays with feature of tunable chemical composition and rich OH groups<sup>20-22</sup> Besides, trivalent metal ions in each layer of LDHs are highly dispersed by divalent metal ions due to the electrostatic repulsion, and this feature is likely to prevent the aggregation of noble metal atoms<sup>23</sup> (Fig. S1). These characteristics endow LDHs great potential as noble metal support materials. Currently, researchers reported a great variety of noble metalbased LDHs catalysts<sup>24-27</sup>. Among them, by involving Pd and Ru into the LDHs using the same synthetic method, we found they have showed very different location, in which the Ru atoms are precisely located above the trivalent Fe site of the NiFe LDHs layer in the single atoms format<sup>28</sup> (Fig. **S2a**), while the Pd was demonstrated to be located on the layer of CoAl LDH in the form of nanoparticles<sup>29</sup> (Fig. **S2b**). To the best of our knowledge, no studies on exploring the accurate location has been carried out when Rh atoms are effectively introduced into LDHs. As such, it is desirable to gain a better understanding of the exact coordination and thereby the defects and electronic structure of Rh containing LDHs.

Herein, as a continuation of our previous efforts, we synthesized ultrathin NiFe with regular-distributed Rh atoms (denoted as Rh/NiFe-x) by a one-step method (Scheme 1). Then theoretical calculation of XANES with fine structure characterization unveiled that Rh atoms were dispersed in the NiFe layers and substituted Fe atoms. Also, hydrazine electrooxidation was carried out as a probe reaction to estimate the catalytic performance of NiFe and Rh/NiFe-x (x = 1.2, 5.4). With the doping of Rh atoms, the Rh/NiFe-x 4 needed a potential of 1.38 eV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. In comparison, NiFe and Bulk-NiFe needed 1.46 eV and 1.52 eV **Scheme 1** The one-step synthetic route and the local structure of Rh/NiFe-x as obtained.

under the same test condition, respectively. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) studies, XAFS fitting and DFT confirmed that the improvement in performance can be attributed to more facile electronic transmission and defects effects caused by structural distortion.

The nitrate used in this article were all purchased from Energy Chemical and  $N_2H_4$ · $H_2O$  (80%) was purchased from Beijing Chemical Reagents Company. The details of preparation method of NiFe, Bulk-NiFe, Rh/NiFe were presented in the supporting information.

#### **Electrochemical performance tests**

The electrochemical performances were tested using a CH760e electrochemical workstation. Then a Pt sheet, an Ag/AgCl electrode and a work electrode were assembled in a one-apartment glass cell to form a three-electrode system. A method of preparing a work electrode is used as follow: 15 mg catalyst was dispersed in 3ml ethanol followed by 30 min of ultrasonication to form a suspension. Then suspension of 210  $\mu L$  of the sample was dropped onto a carbon paper with a pipette gun (1cm  $\times$  1cm). In the hydrazine oxidation reaction, the LSV technique was employed at a scan rate of 5 mV s<sup>-1</sup> after twenty CV scans. The stability tests were operated through a continuously scanning CV measurement.

#### Characterization

The main paragraph text follows directly on here.

Bruker D8 Advance (Cu-K $\alpha$ ) was used to performed XRD analysis. The FT-IR data were recorded to analyze interlayer anions species with a Bruker Vector 22 infrared spectrometer. The accurate loading of Rh and the chemical composition were measured using ICP-AES on a Shimadzu ICPS-7500 instrument.

HRTEM images were collected on a JEOL JEM-2010 electron microscope. XPS was explored with a PHI Quantera SXM. Rh K-edge XAFS measurements were collected at Beamline BL14W1 station in SSRF, Ni and Fe K-edge XAFS measurements were taken at Beamline 1W1B in BSRF. The  $N_2$  and  $H_2$  of the electrocatalytic reactions were detected by Shimadzu GC 2014C-TCD.

#### Structural Properties of Rh/NiFe-x

Ultrathin NiFe-x with different loading amounts of Rh was prepared by one-pot method<sup>30</sup>. By controlling the amount of RhCl<sub>3</sub>, we successfully fabricated a series of catalysts named Rh/NiFe-x (x = 0, 0.5, 1.2, 2.7, 5.4), x corresponded to the mass fraction for the loading amount of Rh, which was tested by the ICP-AES analysis. The powder XRD was first employed to prove the layered structure of LDHs and the results were presented in Fig. 1a. A series of broad Bragg reflections can be observed at  $2\theta \sim 11.4^{\circ}$ ,  $23^{\circ}$  and  $60.8^{\circ}$  (diffraction by (003), (006) and (110) facets), respectively. These characteristic peaks indicate the successful synthesis of LDH. The Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra for Rh/NiFe-x (x = 0, 0.5, 1.2, 2.7, 5.4,Fig. S3) shows the stretching band at 1355 cm<sup>-1</sup>, which is characteristic vibration of CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup> anions in the restricted area of the LDH<sup>31</sup>. To characterize the distribution of Rh element, highresolution TEM (HRTEM) image and corresponding elemental mapping of Rh/NiFe-5.4 nanosheets were collected. In Fig. 1b and Fig. S4, it was shown that Rh element distributed uniformly in the layer of LDH and no obvious particles and clusters can be observed. To determine the thickness of the Rh/NiFe-5.4

nanosheets precisely, atomic force microscopy (AFM) was performed at multiple locations across the sample (Fig. **1c-d**). The Rh/NiFe-5.4 nanosheets were detected a highly average size with a height of 4.5-5nm (about 5-6 layers), and such an ultrathin structure can increase the area in contact with the reactant, and further facilitate the catalyst performance.

To further elucidate the local structural information, the K-edge XANES of Rh in the Rh/NiFe-x nanosheets were collected. Taking Rh/NiFe-5.4 and Rh/NiFe-1.2 as example, the XANES

shows that the Rh K-edge energy of Rh/NiFe-1.2 (23233 eV) and Rh/NiFe-5.4 (23233eV) are the same and both are higher than Rh foil (23220 eV), suggesting that the Rh atoms are electropositive on average (Fig. 2a). The EXAFS k-space spectra of Rh ions in Rh/NiFe-1.2 and Rh/NiFe-5.4 are similar but different from Rh foil and Rh<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> in all oscillation amplitudes interval, which can be attributed to the different electronic structures (Fig. 2b). As shown in Fig. 2c, the first coordination sphere of Rh/NiFe-1.2 and Rh/NiFe-5.4 shows the Rh-O bond of 1.59 Å, while the second coordination c the Rh-M bond of 2.73 Å. The former one is the same as the Rh-O bond of Rh<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, but the latter one can be attributed to neither Rh-Rh bond of Rh foil nor that of Rh<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. To verify the coordination in the second shell of Rh/NiFe-1.2 and Rh/NiFe-5.4, comparison of K-edge of Ni and Fe in NiFe was carried out and presented in Fig. S5, exhibiting a similar distance of M-M shell of the four, which certifies the M of Rh-M bond can be Ni or Fe. Meanwhile, the wavelet transform (WT) analysis of Rh/NiFe-5.4 and NiFe were tested to prove this result. As illustrated by the WT plots of NiFe (Fig. **S6**), the maximum of the transform of NiFe at 6.5 Å<sup>-1</sup> and 8.0 Å<sup>-1</sup> corresponds to the Fe-O and Fe-Ni bond, respectively. By comparing the second shell of Rh/NiFe in Fig. 2d, we can clarify that the maximum at 8.2 Å-1 of Rh/NiFe-5.4 corresponds to the Rh-M bond.

Based on the above characterization, we propose four possible models for the precise location of Rh (Fig. 3a)) here we conducted a theoretical calculation of XANES spectra to further clarify the exact position of Rh. The atomic parameters of four models were given as input to the FDMNES code to obtain the Rh K-edge XANES in a full multiple scattering approach<sup>32</sup>. Comparing the experimentally collected for Rh/NiFe-5.4 and calculated for Model 1, Model 2, Model 3 and Model 4 (Fig. 3b), we found the oscillation of Rh/NiFe-5.4 and Model 1 are of

similarity in the white line, from which we can infer that each Rh ion in Rh/NiFe-x resides as a RhO<sub>6</sub> motif of Model 1. In addition, EXAFS curve fitting was conducted with two backscattering paths of Rh-O and Rh-Ni from model 1 as considered (Fig. 3c and Table S1), unveiling that each Rh atom is coordinated with 5.91 oxygen atoms. This result is in good consistency with the inference obtained by theoretical calculation. Using density functional theory (DFT), we calculated the total energy of the system at different substitution sites of Rh and found that the total energy of Rh atom at Fe sites is 1.36 V lower than that at Ni sites (Fig. S7). Taken together with HRTEM, theoretical calculation of XANES, EXAFS and WT analysis, we can conclude that Rh atoms are doped in the laminate at a coplanar position with other metal ions with the coordination number close to six and replaced partial of Fe atoms.

Moreover, the doped metal has a certain impact on the laminate structure of LDHs. From the FT-EXAFS curve for Rh/NiFe-x (Fig. **S8c**, **f**), it can be observed that the M-O shell at ~2.05 Å<sup>-1</sup> shows little difference among the three LDH samples, but the second M-M shell has a slight reduction. To explain the conclusion quantitatively, the EXAFS fitting of Ni was carried out and the fitting curves and the parameters were exhibited in

Fig. **S9** and Table **S2**. Based on the sequence of coordination number (N) of Ni-O shell (NiFe (5.77) > Rh/NiFe-1.2 (5.66) > Rh/NiFe-5.4 (5.54)) and the Debye-Waller factors, it can be seen that the doping of Rh leads to the distortion of the laminate to some extent.

To further understand the chemical compositions and electronic structure of the electrocatalysts, XPS experiments were performed to verify surface composition and the results were shown in Fig. **S10**. There was no obvious change of the

photoemission feature of Ni 2p and Fe 2p after loading different amounts of Rh atoms and can be assigned to Ni<sup>2+</sup> and Fe<sup>3+</sup> respectively (Fig. **S10a-b**). The Rh/NiFe shows the binding energy of Rh 3d<sub>3/2</sub> and 3d<sub>2/5</sub> at 314.5 eV and 309.7 eV, indicating the existence of Rh<sup>3+</sup> state for Rh atoms<sup>33</sup> (Fig. **S10c**). Besides, a 0.3 eV downshift of O 1s photoemission peaks proves the transmission of the electron from Rh atoms to O atoms (Fig. **S10d**).

#### Electrochemical Activity of NiFe, Bulk-NiFe, Rh/NiFe-5.4

The electrochemical performance of NiFe, Bulk-NiFe, Rh/NiFe-5.4 and carbon paper for hydrazine electrooxidation was measured using a three-electrode system and normalized by surface area (1mg·cm<sup>2</sup>). The structural geometric characterization of Bulk-NiFe was collected and shown in Fig. S11. The LSV curves in Fig. 4a displays that the potential at 10 mA·cm<sup>-2</sup> of Rh/NiFe-5.4 is 1.38 V, lower than those of NiFe (1.46 V), Bulk-NiFe (1.52 V) and carbon paper. Meanwhile, the Tafel slopes of the three are shown in Fig. 4b. Among them, the Rh/NiFe-5.4 has a Tafel slope of 181 mV·dec<sup>-1</sup>, which is slightly lower than 190 mV·dec-1 for NiFe, suggesting a similar reaction mechanism<sup>34</sup>. Moreover, the Nyquist plots of all samples were tested at 1.43 V and exhibited in Fig. 4c, suggesting that the doping of Rh in NiFe can reduce the charge transfer resistance between catalyst and solution. Also, we lobtain an aradaic efficiency close to 95% toward hydrazine electrooxidation by volumetric measurements of the evolved N<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub> (Fig. S12). From Figure S13-14, relative improvement can be observed when the loading amount less than 5.4 wt%. And then we further

loaded more amount of Rh and found that NiFe with more Rh loading shows a lower current increase. Since stability is

essential for electrode material, Rh/NiFe-5.4 was tested in the same solution at the same potential range which exhibited no obvious decline in activity after 1000 cycles (Fig. 4d). The test above showed that the doping of Rh in NiFe promotes the performance of hydrazine electrooxidation with good stability.

To gain further understanding of the activity of the electrocatalyst doping Rh atoms, first principles DFT calculation was performed to explore the metal-support interactions for the Rh/NiFe. The conductivity of electrocatalysts affects a lot on their catalytic activity. For LDHs, the conductivity is negatively correlated with the band gap width. As shown in Fig. 5a, 5c and S12b, the NiFe has a direct band gap of 1.268 eV at Z point, which is consistent with the previous report<sup>35</sup>. After loading Rh atoms, the band gap was obviously narrower than the former (the band gap of Rh/NiFe is 0.623 eV), which indicates that Rh/NiFe was easy to transfer electrons (Fig. 5b-c and S15d). Partial electronic densities of states (PDOS) analysis was also collected and shown in Fig. S16-S17. Around the Fermi level, the PDOS of NiFe are mainly contributed by the Fe 3d electrons and O 2p electrons (Fig. S16). Also, the PDOS of Rh/NiFe are mainly contributed by Rh 3d electrons, Fe 3d electrons and O 2p electrons. Furthermore, the electron density on the O is increased, which is in line with the XPS analysis. It thus can be concluded that doping of Rh leads to further improved electrochemical performance by participating the composition of the valence band and increase the electron cloud density of O 2p orbitals.

Above all, the excellent electrocatalytic activity and durability of Rh/NiFe may result from the following factors: (I) This catalyst synthesized by adjusting the crystallization time has an ultrathin layered structure, which can expose more active sites than the bulk structure. (II) The doping of Rh atoms regulated the overall conductivity of the catalyst and promoted electron

transport, which can be confirmed by the Nyquist plots (Fig. 4c) and the results of DFT calculation. (III) The uniformly dispersed metal ions in LDH layers prevent the aggregation of Rh atoms and catch them by six O atoms, which prevent the precipitation of Rh during the catalytic process.

#### **Conclusions**

In summary, we demonstrate a strategy to synthesize the atomically dispersed Rh atoms modified NiFe layered double hydroxide using a one-step coprecipitation method. With the experimental and theoretical poofs, we identified four possible positions of Rh atoms and finally confirmed that the Rh atoms exist in the layers in a form of RhO<sub>6</sub>. The NiFe with 5.4 wt% loading of Rh atoms exhibits the highest hydrazine electrooxidation performance with the potential of 1.38 V to drive the current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. Besides, the EXAFS fitting reveals that the degree of distortion of the layer and the defect content rise along with the increase of the doping amount of Rh. Hence, our work has clarified the exact structure of the Rh-based LDHs, which is helpful to the design of the noble metal-based catalysts and the understanding of the reaction mechanism. The morphological differences on noble metalbased LDHs synthesized by the same one-step method can likely be addressed in our future work.

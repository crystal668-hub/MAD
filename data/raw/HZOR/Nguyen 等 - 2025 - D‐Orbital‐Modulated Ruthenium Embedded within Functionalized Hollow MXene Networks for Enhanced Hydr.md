**Electrochemical green hydrogen production via water splitting is an attractive and sustainable pathway; however, the sluggish kinetics of anodic oxygen evolution reaction is still a critical challenge. In this study, an effective electrocatalyst engineering approach is demonstrated by preparing an innovative hybrid of ruthenium d-orbitals-regulated nanoclusters embedding within functionalized hollow Ti3C2 MXene networks (Ru0.91Ni0.09-N/O-Ti3C2) to promote the hydrazine-assisted hydrogen production. A specific charge redistribution is revealed, locally concentrating at interfaces derived from stable Ru(Ni)-N/O-Ti coordination and** *d***–***p* **orbital hybridization. The charge transfer effect from Ni to Ru within Ru0.91Ni0.09 structure and Ru0.91Ni0.09 to N/O-Ti3C2 tailors electronic features of Ru sites to enable reasonable adsorption/desorption toward reactant intermediates. The Ru0.91Ni0.09- N/O-Ti3C2 requires an overpotential of only 29.3 mV for cathodic hydrogen evolution and a low potential of −29.9 mV for anodic hydrazine oxidation to reach 10 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2, showing excellent stability. The hydrazine-assisted hydrogen production system based on Ru0.91Ni0.09-N/O-Ti3C2 electrodes delivers small cell voltages of 0.02 V at 10 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> and 0.92 V at industrial current level of 1.0 A cm<sup>−</sup>2. This work may open a new electrocatalysis strategy from lab scale to industry for robust and efficient green hydrogen production.**

## **1. Introduction**

Water electrolysis has been realized as an ideal technology for sustainable green hydrogen production. Unfortunately, commercialization of this technique still faces several challenges caused by sluggish kinetics and high energy barriers of anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which requires a high-voltage input (1.6–2.0 V)[\[1–3\]](#page-10-0) and consumes ≈90% energy supply during the electrolysis process. In addition, a membrane is necessary to minimize the O2 crossover effect, which raises safety concerns caused by the formation of an explosive O2 + H2 mixture.[\[4,5\]](#page-10-0) Therefore, developing an effective electrocatalysis strategy with a favorable thermodynamic without a negative influence of OER is highly desirable to achieve high efficiency, safety, and environmental friendliness toward hydrogen production. In this sense, coupling cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and anodic electro-oxidation of small organic molecules, for instance, urea, ethanol, or hydrazine (Hz), has been

emerging as potential solutions.[\[6–8\]](#page-11-0) Among them, Hz oxidation reaction (HzOR, N2H4 + 4OH<sup>−</sup>↔N2 + 4H2O + 4e<sup>−</sup>) has attracted a lot of interest due to its low theoretical overpotential of −0.33 V (vs RHE) to significantly reduce energy consumption and fast reaction kinetics.[\[9,10\]](#page-11-0) The Hz reaction generates non-toxic N2 product release as its by-products, much safer and more eco-friendly than urea oxidation reaction (which produces CO2/N2 gases).[\[11\]](#page-11-0) Moreover, hydrazine is widely used in various industrial fields, for instance, rocket fuel, medical drugs, herbicides and synthesis of foaming agents, which often results in highly toxic hydrazine in sewage.[\[4\]](#page-10-0) Therefore, coupling Hz reaction with water splitting is beneficial for producing high-purity H2 while maintaining environmental sustainability. Recent findings have noted that metallic ruthenium (Ru) displays an extraordinary HER and HzOR performance owing to its high intrinsic activity, tunable d-orbitals, and cost-effectiveness compared to Pt-based electrocatalysts. However, the strong binding energy with H on Ru surface certainly limits its HER performance.[\[12\]](#page-11-0) The over-strong coupling hybridization of N-p and Ru-d orbitals also leads to excessive adsorption energies of Hz reaction

intermediates on Ru surface, thereby blocking dehydrogenation and desorption steps.<sup>[5,13]</sup> It has been realized that incorporating a small portion of foreign atoms from 3d transition metal groups can adjust local electron density and d-band centers of Ru due to charge density redistribution and *d-d* orbital coupling.[14,15] Similar electronic effects could also be observed toward Ru-based active structures since they are immobilized on functionalized supporting materials.<sup>[15]</sup> Although high-conductivity and chemicalresistance carbon allotropes can effectively support catalysts from being agglomerated, [16,17] their chemical inertness often results in poor interfacial interactions and fails to properly regulate and tailor electronic structures of active guests, thus limiting electrochemical functions. In contrast, MXenes, a new class of 2D inorganic compounds, have recently been viewed as promising alternatives owing to their unique layered structure with large surface area, high electrical conductivity, and hydrophilicity.<sup>[18,19]</sup> Abundance of negatively charged O-terminated groups favorably functionalizes MXene's surface to easily attract positively charged metal ions and then secures a uniform dispersion of the resulting active catalyst. In particular, those groups can greatly influence d-band centers of active catalysts through strong interfacial interactions caused by M-O-Ti bridges with a d-p orbital coupling effect.[20,21] Partial substitution of high-electronegative Oterminated groups with N-terminated counterparts to form Ndoped MXene (N/O-MXene) could further effectively tailor local microenvironments at the surface to exhibit high oxidation resistance and accelerate charge transfer.[22-24] Adding certain N dopants into the surface has been demonstrated to reduce van der Waals forces between MXene nanosheets, thereby minimizing the stacked layer effect due to self-aggregation to effectively increase the interlayer spacing of Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>y</sub> and creating highly porous structures, which not only can improve accessible active centers but also can facilitate rapid diffusion and transmission of electrolyte ions, thereby enhancing electrochemical performance.[25-27]

Motivated by the merits of these above-mentioned materials, in this study, we developed an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst by well-dispersing Ru-rich alloy ( $Ru_{0.91}Ni_{0.09}$ ) nanoclusters on porous N/O-MXene (N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>) support ( $Ru_{0.91}Ni_{0.09}-N/O-N/O-N/O-N/O-N/O-N/O-N/O-N/O-N/O-N/O$ 

 $Ti_3C_2$ ) for simultaneously catalyzing both HER and HzOR. The presence of a minor Ni portion in Ru-rich alloy structures and the modified surface chemistry of N/O-Ti $_3C_2$  endowing unique interfacial Ru(Ni)-N/O-Ti interactions effectively improved electronic redistribution and adjust d-band centers of Ru, thereby optimizing binding strength and adsorption energies of reaction intermediates to promote electrochemical reactions, overperforming most electrocatalysts previously reported. For the overall Hz-assisted electrolysis process, the Ru $_{0.91}$ Ni $_{0.09}$ -N/O-Ti $_3$ C $_{2(+,\cdot)}$  achieved industrial-level current densities of 0.5 A cm $^{-2}$  and 1.0 A cm $^{-2}$  at low potentials of 0.52 and 0.92 V, respectively. It also showed a dramatic reduction in energy consumption (0.35 kWh m $^{-3}$  H $_2$ ) compared to conventional water splitting (5.37 kWh m $^{-3}$  H $_2$ ) at 150 mA cm $^{-2}$ .

### 2. Results and Discussion

Figure 1 schematically illustrates the highly porous Ru<sub>0,91</sub>Ni<sub>0,09</sub>-N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> preparation via melamine formaldehyde (MF) templating method with a subsequent chemical reduction process. Briefly, a few-layered Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> MXene suspension was initially synthesized using HCl/LiF etching and exfoliation method (Figure S1, Supporting Information), as described in our earlier reports.[28,29] A sacrificial template step was then applied to obtain negatively charged Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> nanosheets-wrapped positively charged melamine nanospheres via electrostatic interactions (Figure S2, Supporting Information).[27] Through a subsequent pyrolysis process, melamine was decomposed to active NH<sub>3</sub> vapor beneficial for N-doping, leaving a well-defined porous N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> hollow framework (Figure S3, Supporting Information). Benefiting from a negatively charged surface, N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> could easily adsorb positive Ni<sup>2+</sup>/Ru<sup>3+</sup> ions, which were crystallized during thermal treatment at 350 °C in H<sub>2</sub>/Ar atmosphere to form Ru-richen alloys of  $Ru_{0.91}Ni_{0.09}$  with stabilization secured via strong metal-support interactions. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the Ru<sub>0.91</sub>Ni<sub>0.09</sub>-N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> in Figure 2a displays its unique porosity with homogeneous dispersion of numerous inner voids covered by outer shells of thin nanosheets caused by the removal of MF nanosphere template.

Ru-N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> and Ni-N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> materials also exhibited identical porous structures, as shown in Figures S4 and S5 (Supporting Information), respectively. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image conducted at the Center for Universitywide Research Facilities (CURF), Jeonbuk National University (JBNU), shown in Figure S6 (Supporting Information), verified the thin nature of exfoliated Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> sheets, which appeared to be a lattice fringe of an interlayer spacing of 1.05 nm, which could be attributed to Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> MXene structure comprised of 3-4 layers. [26-27] High-resolution TEM images further revealed the presence of abundant nanoclusters uniformly distributed on N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> surface without observable aggregates (Figure 2b). High-angle annular dark-field scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM) image exhibited an average size distribution of ≈2.1 nm for the Ru<sub>0.91</sub>Ni<sub>0.09</sub> clusters (Figure 2c). Observation into the structure of a nanocluster revealed a lattice fringe of 0.203 nm, corresponding to the (101) facet of  $Ru_{0.91}Ni_{0.09}$  (Figure 2d,e). This value is slightly smaller than the original lattice fringe of Ru (101) (≈0.206 nm) due to a low atomic radius of incorporated Ni atoms, which could interject between Ru atoms and lead to a shrinking effect of crystalline structures (Figure 2f).[30,31] STEM-energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) analysis of a Ru<sub>0.91</sub>Ni<sub>0.09</sub>-N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> sheet showed uniform color mapping images of Ru, Ni, Ti, C, N, and O elements (Figure 2g), indicating a homogeneous distribution over the entire sample. The formation of Ru<sub>0.91</sub>Ni<sub>0.09</sub> alloy was further confirmed by the EDS-line scanning profile (Figure 2h), which indicated the concentration of Ni and Ru signals over the structure of selected clusters. A much higher Ru signal intensity compared to Ni was approximately consistent with a corresponding atomic ratio of 0.91:0.09 (Figure S7, Supporting Information). Inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) technique quantitively verified a Ru mass loading of 6.5 wt.% in Ru<sub>0.91</sub>Ni<sub>0.09</sub>-N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> material. The crystalline structure of the Ru<sub>0.91</sub>Ni<sub>0.09</sub>-N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> sample was examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Figure 2i), which showed a dominant facet of Ru<sub>0.91</sub>Ni<sub>0.09</sub> (101) at 44.1° together with several typical peaks at  $2\theta$  of 38.4 and 42.3°, consistent with its (100) and (002) crystal planes, respectively (JCPDS No. 85–4795). Characteristic peaks of Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> MXene were also clearly observed, indicating the successful introduction of Ru<sub>0.91</sub>Ni<sub>0.09</sub> over N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> substrate. Interestingly, immobilization of abundant Ru<sub>0.91</sub>Ni<sub>0.09</sub> clusters on MXene surface led to a reduction of  $Ti_3C_2$  (002) intensity. This implies that the Ru<sub>0.91</sub>Ni<sub>0.09</sub> clusters can promote the exfoliation state of MXene nanosheets via a self-restacking barrier effect, as demonstrated by early reports, [32,33] in good agreement with the enhanced BET specific surface area (47.16 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>), which is 3.54 times higher than that of a pristine  $Ti_3C_2T_x$  MXene (13.34 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>) (Figure S8, Supporting Information). To understand electronic states of the Ru<sub>0.91</sub>Ni<sub>0.09</sub>-N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> triggered by alloying and N doping effects, density functional theory (DFT) was studied to gain insights into electronic configuration at interfaces and d-band center. Atomic models of  $Ru_{0.91}Ni_{0.09}$ -N/O- $Ti_3C_2$ ,  $Ru_{0.91}Ni_{0.09}$ -O- $Ti_3C_2$ , Ru-N/O- $Ti_3C_2$ ,  $Ru_{0.91}Ni_{0.09}$  and  $N/O-Ti_3C_2$  structures were constructed in Figures S9 and S10 (Supporting Information) according to the basis of experimental results. The charge density difference clearly indicated an electron cloud substantially occurring at the interface between Ru<sub>0.91</sub>Ni<sub>0.09</sub> and N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> (Figure 2j), suggesting the strong chemical interactions between d-orbitals of Ru/Ni and p-orbital of N/O in N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> structure, consistent

with an efficient formation of Ru(Ni)-N/O-Ti bridges. Interestingly, inserting N-terminated group dopant produced a charge transfer number of 2.64 |e| from Ru<sub>0.91</sub>Ni<sub>0.09</sub> to N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>, larger than 2.59 |e| from  $Ru_{0.91}Ni_{0.09}$  to O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> in  $Ru_{0.91}Ni_{0.09}$ -O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>, (Figure \$11, Supporting Information), implying a significant regulation contribution by N doping effect to improve stability, conductivity, and thermodynamic energy barrier toward electrocatalytic reactions.[20] The electron localization function (ELF) of Ru<sub>0.91</sub>Ni<sub>0.09</sub>-N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> also verified the robust localization of electrons at interfaces (Figure 2k; Figure S12, Supporting Information), thus facilitating the charge transfer process. Calculation of projected density of states (PDOS) indicated that Ru-3d and Ni-3d orbitals in Ru<sub>0.91</sub>Ni<sub>0.09</sub>-N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> demonstrated the most contributions at near Fermi level, implying their crucial roles in defining electrical conductivity and metallic behavior of the material. The N-2p and O-2p orbitals unveiled substantial overlap with Ru-3d, Ni-3d, and Ti-3d orbitals, confirming strong p-d orbital hybridization and subsequently improving the site-to-site electron transfer (Figure S13, Supporting Information). Interestingly, there was solid evidence of electron reconfiguration for Ru and Ni in Ru<sub>0.91</sub>Ni<sub>0.09</sub>-N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> since their d-band center was significantly modified by unique Ru(Ni)-N/O-Ti coordination (Figure 21). As shown in Figure 2m and Figure S14 (Supporting Information), d-band centers of Ru and Ni were found to be -1.81 and -1.44 eV, respectively, which were more negative than those of Ru (-1.79 eV) and Ni (-1.43 eV) in  $Ru_{0.91}Ni_{0.09}$ -O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>, although they were relatively comparable with than those of Ru (-1.67 eV) and Ni (-1.60 eV) in bulk  $Ru_{0.91}Ni_{0.09}$  material. However, these d-band values, especially the Ru d-band, were close to the theoretical d-band center of Pt (-2.186 eV), an optimal indicator to obtain the most favorable hydrogen binding energy toward H<sub>2</sub> production. [34] Therefore, the unique interfacial coupling effect between  $Ru_{0.91}Ni_{0.09}$  and  $N/O-Ti_3C_2$  can well promote the conductivity, electronic structure, and stability of the resulting catalyst. A highly structural disorder of the MXene by hybridizing Ru<sub>0.91</sub>Ni<sub>0.09</sub> clusters compared to pristine one was revealed by Raman analysis (Figure S15, Supporting Information), which showed a notable shift of  $E_g$  and  $A_{1\,g}$  vibrational modes.

We performed X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) to further investigate the electronic properties of the Ru<sub>0.91</sub>Ni<sub>0.09</sub>-N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> material. Ru K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra showed that the Ru oxidation state in  $Ru_{0.91}Ni_{0.09}$ -N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> was close to that in Ru foil of Ru<sup>0</sup> (Figure 3a), suggesting a near-metallic state of Ru. Notably, a slight shift of the absorption edge was observed in Ru<sub>0.91</sub>Ni<sub>0.09</sub>-N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> relative to Ru-N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>, suggesting that the Ru gained some charge when Ni was incorporated in the Ru<sub>0.91</sub> Ni<sub>0.09</sub>-N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> material. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra of Ru<sub>0.91</sub>Ni<sub>0.09</sub>-N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> indicated a dominant peak at 2.39 Å associated with Ru-Ru/Ni coordination (Figure 3b).[30,35] A minor peak at 1.40 Å resulted from Ru-N/O coordination; however, no obvious Ru-based oxides were noticed for the Ru<sub>0.91</sub>Ni<sub>0.09</sub>-N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> material, as evidenced by the specific wavelet transform for k3-weighted Ru K-edge EXAFS signals (Figure 3c). A slightly shorter bond length for the Ru-Ru/Ni coordination shell was observed in Ru<sub>0.91</sub>Ni<sub>0.09</sub>-N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> compared to the Ru-Ru coordination shell in Ru-N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>, likely due to the smaller atomic radius of Ni incorporated in Ru<sub>0.91</sub>Ni<sub>0.09</sub>. N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>. As shown in Figure 3d, Ni K-edge XANES spectra

revealed a white line intensity of  $Ru_{0.91}Ni_{0.09}\mbox{-}N/\mbox{O-Ti}_3\mbox{C}_2$  and Ni-N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> located between those of Ni foil and NiO. The Ni oxidation state in the Ru<sub>0.91</sub>Ni<sub>0.09</sub>-N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> sample was estimated to be +1.26, higher than that of Ni-N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> (+1.13) (Figure S16, Supporting Information), indicating that Ni lost some charge when Ru was present in the material. Thus, elaborating the results from both Ru K-edge and Ni K-edge XANES analyses indicated an occurrence of charge transfer from Ni to Ru within the Ru<sub>0.91</sub>Ni<sub>0.09</sub> nanostructure. Ni K-edge EXAFS spectrum of Ru<sub>0.91</sub>Ni<sub>0.09</sub>-N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> showed a greater bond length for the first coordination shell than that observed in Ni-N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>, which can be attributable to the incorporation of Ni in  $Ru_{0.91}Ni_{0.09}$ -N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>, where Ru exhibited a larger atomic radius than Ni. Moreover, the presence of Ni-N/O and Ni-Ni/Ru coordination at 1.63 and 2.32 Å, respectively, implied a strong interfacial interaction between Ru<sub>0.91</sub>Ni<sub>0.09</sub> structure and N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> through Ni-N/O bridges (Figure 3e). This was well supported by wavelet transform (WT) Ni K-edge EXAFS shown in Figure 3f.[36] To quantitatively

determine the local coordination configurations of Ru and Ni atoms within the Ru<sub>0.91</sub>Ni<sub>0.09</sub>-N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> catalyst, we performed the fitting results of the EXAFS curves (Figure S17 and Table S1,S2, Supporting Information) and their results were further verified the formation alloy structure. The reliable evidence supporting the manipulated electronic structure of Ru and Ni within Ru<sub>0.91</sub>Ni<sub>0.09</sub> in Ru<sub>0.91</sub>Ni<sub>0.09</sub>-N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> was obtained by performing X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) at Korea Basic Science Institute (KBSI), Jeonju Center. Survey XPS spectra (Figure \$18, Supporting Information) showed the existence of respective elements on the surface of materials. High-resolution XPS spectra of (C 1s + Ru 3d) binding energies exhibited peaks of 279.6 and 283.8 eV assigned to Ru  $3d_{5/2}$  and Ru  $3d_{3/2}$ , respectively (Figure 3g).[37] Four peaks centering at binding energies of 280.6, 284.3, 286.2, and 298.2 eV corresponded to C-Ti, C-C, C-N, and C-O species, respectively.[38] Impressively, the Ru 3d signal in the  $\rm Ru_{0.91}Ni_{0.09}\text{-}N/O\text{-}Ti_3C_2$  material was slightly negatively shifted as compared to that of the Ru-N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>, indicating a reduced

oxidation state of Ru within Ru<sub>0.91</sub>Ni<sub>0.09</sub> caused by charge donation from a low electronegative Ni to a high electronegative Ru. [39] As shown in Figure 3h, high-resolution XPS Ni 2p spectra of the Ru<sub>0.91</sub>Ni<sub>0.09</sub>-N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> material revealed the existence of peak doublets at (9852.1 and 868.4) eV, (855.1 and 872.7) eV, and (860.8 and 879.5) eV associated with binding energies of Ni<sup>0</sup>, Ni<sup>2+</sup>, and its corresponding satellite, respectively.[31,39] The Ni 2p spectrum of Ru<sub>0.91</sub>Ni<sub>0.09</sub>-N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> was positively shifted to a higher binding energy than that of Ni-N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>, further evidencing the formation of electron-deficient Ni and electron-rich Ru states within  $Ru_{0.91}Ni_{0.09}$  structures. Surface chemistry of the  $Ru_{0.91}Ni_{0.09}$ -N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> was also verified by binding energies of N 1s with Ti-N (397.0 eV), pyridinic-N (397.9 eV), and pyrrolic-N (399.5 eV), [38,40] binding energies of O 1s with Ti/Ru(Ni)-O (529.3 eV), C-Ti-OH (530.8 eV), and N-O (532.1 eV), [40,41] and binding energies of (Ti 2p + Ru 3p) with Ti-N (454.8 and 462.2 eV), Ti-C (456.1 and 463.2 eV), and Ti-O (457.8 and 464.1 eV) (Figure S19, Supporting Information).[26,38] Interestingly, such N 1s and O 1s binding energies in Ru<sub>0.91</sub>Ni<sub>0.09</sub>-N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> exhibited negative shifts compared to bare N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> (Figure S20, Supporting Information), aligning well with charge difference occurred at the interfacial area caused by charge transfer from Ru<sub>0.91</sub>Ni<sub>0.09</sub> to N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>. To further understand the effectively manipulated electronic structure in  $Ru_{0.91}Ni_{0.09}$ -N/O-Ti $_3C_2$ , the work functions of components were studied. Results shown in Figure 3i revealed a higher work function of N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> (6.32 eV) than  $Ru_{0.91}Ni_{0.09}$ (4.02 eV), suggesting charge migration from  $Ru_{0.91}Ni_{0.09}$  to N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>, which was similarly observed in recently reported nanohybrid systems.<sup>[42,43]</sup> The potential difference at interfaces might have caused internal polarization field effects that are beneficial for regulating local microenvironments of active sites, thereby improving overall electrochemical reactions (Figure 3j).[44,45]

Electrocatalytic HER performances of Ru<sub>0.91</sub>Ni<sub>0.09</sub>-N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> and other materials were evaluated by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) in an aqueous alkaline solution (1.0 M KOH). To investigate the effect of Ni content, we varied Ru:Ni (2:1, 3:1, and 6:1) weight percentage and assessed its electrocatalytic activity. As shown in Figure S21 (Supporting Information), the ratio of Ru:Ni = 3:1 exhibited the best HER catalytic activity, indicating the optimal amount of Ni doping on Ru lattices. The  $Ru_{0.91}Ni_{0.09}-N/O-Ti_3C_2$  catalyst delivered a small overpotential ( $\eta$ ) of 29.3 mV to reach 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> with a low Tafel slope of  $55.4 \,\mathrm{mV}\,\mathrm{dec^{-1}}$ , surpassing its counterparts such as Ru-N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>  $(\eta_{10} = 53.8 \text{ mV}, 89.2 \text{ mV dec}^{-1})$ , Ni-N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>  $(\eta_{10} = 268.2 \text{ mV},$ 153.1 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>), and N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> ( $\eta_{10} = 434.8$  mV, 292.3 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>), unveiling its faster reaction kinetics (**Figure 4a**,b). Notably, its catalytic behavior was slightly better than that of the state-of-the-art Pt/C catalyst ( $\eta_{10} = 32.5 \text{ mV}$ , 59.8 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>). It was even superior to those of recently reported Ru/Ni-based HER electrocatalysts in alkaline media (Table \$3, Supporting Information). Tafel slope of Ru<sub>0.91</sub>Ni<sub>0.09</sub>-N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> was close to 40 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>. This suggests that its HER mechanism follows a Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism, in which Volmer is the rate-determining step during the reaction.<sup>[46]</sup> Intrinsic activities of as-prepared catalysts were assessed in Figure 4c, in which turnover frequency (TOF) plotted against overpotential (Figures S22 and S23, Supporting Information) also confirmed superior catalytic properties of the Ru<sub>0.91</sub>Ni<sub>0.09</sub>-N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>. Specifically, a TOF value of 0.486 H<sub>2</sub> h<sup>-1</sup> was observed for  $Ru_{0.91}Ni_{0.09}$ -N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> at  $\eta$  of

200 mV, which was 1.0, 1.5, 21.3, or 32.4 times higher than that of Pt/C (0.485  $H_2$   $h^{-1}$ ), Ru-N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> (0.307  $H_2$   $h^{-1}$ ), Ni-N/O- $Ti_3C_2$  (0.022  $H_2$   $h^{-1}$ ), or N/O- $Ti_3C_2$  (0.014  $H_2$   $h^{-1}$ ), respectively. In addition, the highest current exchange density (j<sub>0</sub>) of 2.88 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> was found for Ru<sub>0.91</sub>Ni<sub>0.09</sub>-N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> catalysts among all surveyed candidates, such as Ru-N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> (2.04 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>), Ni- $N/O-Ti_3C_2$  (0.34 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>), and  $N/O-Ti_3C_2$  (0.27 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>). These achievements suggest that the Ru<sub>0.91</sub>Ni<sub>0.09</sub>-N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> catalyst has remarkable intrinsic HER activities toward HER. In another aspect, we estimated the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) of catalysts, which is consistent with the corresponding C<sub>dl</sub> value measured by CV at different scan rates (Figure S24, Supporting Information). The Ru<sub>0.91</sub>Ni<sub>0.09</sub>-N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> showed a larger ECSA than Ru-N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>, Ni-N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>, and N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> (Figure \$25, Supporting Information), suggesting its greater enhancement of accessible active center density for catalyzing the HER process. Accordingly, the specific activity (SA) derived from the ECSA-normalized LSV response of Ru<sub>0.91</sub>Ni<sub>0.09</sub>-N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> was much better than those of other materials (Figure S26, Supporting Information). Remarkably, Ru<sub>0.91</sub>Ni<sub>0.09</sub>-N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> material possessed a SA value of 0.56 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> at  $\eta$  value of 200 mV,  $\approx$ 1.75 times higher than that of Pt/C (0.32 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>). Furthermore, mass activity (MA) and price activity (PA) as crucial parameters informing the performance-cost relationship indicated that  $Ru_{0.91}Ni_{0.09}\text{-N/O-Ti}_3C_2$  could deliver an MA of 0.628 A  $mg_{\mbox{\tiny R}1}^{-1}$  and a PA of 257.46 A dollar<sup>-1</sup>, as shown in Figure 4d and Figure S27 (Supporting Information), which were 3.5 and 20.8 times higher than those of Pt/C (0.179 A  $mg_{Pt}^{-1}$  and 12.33 A dollar<sup>-1</sup>) at  $\eta$  of 200 mV, respectively, intriguingly proving its great cost-effective promise for industrial application. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used to assess charge transfer properties and reaction kinetics of materials. As shown in Figure S28 (Supporting Information),  $Ru_{0.91}Ni_{0.09}$ -N/O-Ti $_3C_2$  had a smaller semicircle diameter than its counterparts, suggesting that its better charge transfer properties were due to a unique internal polarization field between interfaces of its components. The operando EIS tests (Figure 4e,f) clearly showed lower phase angles in Bode plots of  $Ru_{0.91}Ni_{0.09}$ -N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> than N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> at identically applied potentials, suggesting that its dominant charge state was involved in the HER process. Additionally, Ru<sub>0.91</sub>Ni<sub>0.09</sub>-N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> also exhibited a rapid decrease of phase angle with increasing overpotential (Figure \$29, Supporting Information). This further confirms that Volmer is the rate-determining step for HER in an alkaline medium. [47,48] The exceptional performance of Ru<sub>0.91</sub>Ni<sub>0.09</sub>-N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> was also demonstrated by its excellent durability for long-term HER operation. Time-dependent current response (jt) shown in Figure 4g indicated satisfactory retention rates of 97.0% and 92% for Ru<sub>0.91</sub>Ni<sub>0.09</sub>-N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> during 50 h of continuous working at 10 and 50 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, respectively. Impressively, the morphology and structure of post-HER Ru<sub>0.91</sub>Ni<sub>0.09</sub>-N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> were retained well as shown in Figures S30 and S31 (Supporting Information), showing that Ru<sub>0.91</sub>Ni<sub>0.09</sub> nanostructures were still uniformly interspersed on the surface of porous N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> sheets. Excitingly, no obvious change of surface chemistry was observed by XPS analysis (Figure S32, Supporting Information), supporting the stability of  $\rm Ru_{0.91}Ni_{0.09}\text{-}N/O\text{-}Ti_3C_2$  material for long-term HER in an alkaline medium. An overall comparison of HER performances of Ru<sub>0.91</sub>Ni<sub>0.09</sub>-N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> and its counterparts in Figure 4h further reflects the greatest loop area

of  $Ru_{0.91}Ni_{0.09}$ -N/O- $Ti_3C_2$  for achieving superior electrocatalytic performance.

Coupling HER with anodic HzOR for green hydrogen production is an energy-efficient and eco-friendly technology caused by the advantages of HzOR over OER in terms of thermodynami-

cally favorable oxidation reactions and low energy consumption. Therefore, catalytic performances of synthesized materials toward HzOR were also studied. LSV curves of  $Ru_{0.91}Ni_{0.09}\cdot N/O$ - $Ti_3C_2$  in Figure S33 (Supporting Information) showed an enhanced current response with increasing  $N_2H_4$  concentration,

inferring its high efficiency was satisfactory for HzOR. Distinct from OER, the required HzOR potential was greatly reduced as shown in Figure 4i. In addition, Ru<sub>0.91</sub>Ni<sub>0.09</sub>-N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> needed only -29.9 mV (vs RHE) to reach a current density of 10 mA  $cm^{-2}$  in 1.0 M KOH + 0.5 M  $N_2H_4$ , outperforming Ru-N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> (2.24 mV), Ni-N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> (411.0 mV), N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> (412.7 mV), and commercial Pt/C (134.7 mV), revealing its superior HzOR kinetics (Figure 4j). The HzOR behavior of Ru<sub>0.91</sub>Ni<sub>0.09</sub>-N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> was also highly comparable to the most recently reported HzOR electrocatalysts (Table S4, Supporting Information). As shown in Figure 4k, Ru<sub>0.91</sub>Ni<sub>0.09</sub>-N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> had a Tafel slope of 40.6 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>, which was significantly smaller than those of  $Ru-N/O-Ti_3C_2$  (87.6 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>),  $Ni-N/O-Ti_3C_2$  (168.8 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>), N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> (196.5 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>), and Pt/C (102.1 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>), implying a fast kinetics of Ru<sub>0.91</sub>Ni<sub>0.09</sub>-N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> toward HzOR. This was effectively supported by EIS analysis, which displayed a more rapid charge transfer of  $Ru_{0.91}Ni_{0.09}$ -N/O-Ti $_3C_2$  catalyst than others (Figure \$34, Supporting Information). In addition,

excellent intrinsic activities of catalysts for HzOR were explored by measuring TOF (Figure S35, Supporting Information) and

SA (Figure \$36, Supporting Information). Furthermore, the sta-

bility of Ru<sub>0.91</sub>Ni<sub>0.09</sub>-N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> toward HzOR was also evalu-

ated in Figure S37 (Supporting Information), exhibiting high-

performance retention rates of ≈92.5% and 90.0% at current den-

sities of 10 and 50 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, respectively, over 50 h of operation.

SEM and XRD analyses of the post-HzOR sample indicated no

significant change in morphology or crystallinity (Figures \$38

and \$39, Supporting Information). The chemical states of the

post-HzOR sample were also well intact, same as its initial state (Figure S40, Supporting Information), evidencing the structural

stability of Ru<sub>0.91</sub> Ni<sub>0.09</sub>-N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> during HzOR. Interfacial water on the surface of electrocatalysts is an interesting factor influencing their catalytic behavior. Therefore, the role of interfacial water was evaluated for N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> and Ru<sub>0.91</sub>Ni<sub>0.09</sub>-N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> by performing operando Raman analysis at varied applied potentials ranging from open circuit voltage (OCP) to -1.4~V (vs Ag/AgCl). The  $Ru_{0.91}Ni_{0.09}\text{-N/O-T}i_3C_2$  and N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> showed a board peak located from 3000 to 3900 cm<sup>-1</sup>, corresponding to the O-H stretching mode of water (Figure 5a,b). The O-H stretching mode could be fitted into three vibrational modes of 4-coordinate hydrogen-bonded water (4-HBW, ≈3200 cm<sup>-1</sup>), 2-coordinate hydrogen-bonded water (2-HBW, ≈3400 cm<sup>-1</sup>), and dangling O-H bonds of free water ( $\approx$ 3600 cm<sup>-1</sup>).<sup>[49,50]</sup> The first two peaks, 4-HBW and 2-HBW, occupied a considerable proportion, suggesting the enrichment and accumulation of H<sub>2</sub>O molecules on the surface. Meanwhile, dangling O-H bonds of free water are found to be inactive water toward HER.[51,52] As the HER was going on, the peak intensity of interfacial water was rapidly decreased on the surface of Ru<sub>0.91</sub>Ni<sub>0.09</sub>-N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>, implying consumption and conformation of interfacial water. Intriguingly, when the potential was reversed to OCP, the interfacial water signal was immediately recovered, suggesting timely surface replenishment and recovery of interfacial water on Ru<sub>0.91</sub>Ni<sub>0.09</sub>-N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>. For the dangling O-H bond known as inactive water, its proportion on Ru<sub>0.91</sub>Ni<sub>0.09</sub>-N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> was fast downward, indicating highly capable of cleaving H-OH bonds (Figure 5c). Meanwhile, its unchanged proportion on N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> during the HER process indicated poor interfacial water utilization and resistance to H-OH

cleavage. Therefore, it can be concluded that the introduction of Ru<sub>0.91</sub>Ni<sub>0.09</sub> NCs on N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> MXene substrates could basically induce rapid enrichment and consumption of interfacial H<sub>2</sub>O, subsequently improving Volmer step and HER kinetics. To verify the above hypothesis and the theoretical effect of interfacial water structure, we performed ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations. Representative snapshots of interfacial water on the surface of N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> and Ru<sub>0.91</sub>Ni<sub>0.09</sub>-N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> are presented in Figure 5d,e. The location of interfacial water was relatively far from the surface of N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> than Ru<sub>0.91</sub>Ni<sub>0.09</sub>-N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>, suggesting that Ru<sub>0.91</sub>Ni<sub>0.09</sub> structure ultimately accounted for H<sub>2</sub>O adsorption and dissociation, leading to remarkable HER activity in alkaline medium. Specifically, the average number of H-bonds in interfacial water was found to be 25 for N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> and 17 for Ru<sub>0.91</sub>Ni<sub>0.09</sub>-N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> (Figure 5f), indicating disruption of the H-bond network to enhance H<sub>2</sub>O adsorption on Ru<sub>0.91</sub>Ni<sub>0.09</sub>-N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> surface.<sup>[53]</sup> Furthermore, DFT calculation was studied to gain insight into the catalytic properties of Ru<sub>0.91</sub>Ni<sub>0.09</sub>-N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>. Total DOS manifested a higher occupied state of Ru<sub>0.91</sub>Ni<sub>0.09</sub>-N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> at Fermi level than Ru-N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> or Ru<sub>0.91</sub>Ni<sub>0.09</sub>-O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> counterparts (Figure 5g), indicating its enhanced electrical conductivity and high electron density at interfaces caused by strong interactions between Ru<sub>0.91</sub>Ni<sub>0.09</sub> and N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> (Figure S41, Supporting Information). Since the water dissociation step is typically considered a rate-determining step (RDS) for the alkaline HER process, we initially assessed water adsorption energy with different catalyst structures (Figure 5h). The Ru<sub>0.91</sub>Ni<sub>0.09</sub>-N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> possessed a stronger H<sub>2</sub>O adsorption energy (-0.93 eV) than N/O-Ti $_3$ C $_2$  (-0.16 eV), suggesting that active sites of Ru<sub>0.91</sub>Ni<sub>0.09</sub>-N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> favorably attracted H<sub>2</sub>O molecules, well consistent with AIDM simulations and water contact angle results (Figure S42, Supporting Information). In contrast, the extremely negative adsorption energy of Ru-N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> (-1.9 eV) might have caused a much stronger adsorption capacity toward H<sub>2</sub>O, thus hindering H-OH cleavage in the next Volmer step.<sup>[54]</sup> In alkaline HER, the reaction pathway typically follows four steps: initial H<sub>2</sub>O contact/adsorption, H<sub>2</sub>O dissociation, formation of H\* intermediates, and H2 release. The Gibbs free energy differences between the first and second steps,  $\Delta GH_2O$ , and between the third and fourth steps,  $\Delta G_{H^*}$ , are widely employed to assess its electrocatalytic activity. [55] As shown in Figure 5i, the N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> demonstrated an uphill energy barrier of 1.59 eV, thus hindering H<sub>2</sub>O dissociation and resulting in sluggish HER kinetics. Meanwhile, the Ru<sub>0.91</sub>Ni<sub>0.09</sub>-N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> and Ru-N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> showed thermodynamically favorable water dissociation process with negative free energies of -0.71 and -0.18 eV, respectively. The more negative value indicated the easier water dissociation step, thus supplying sufficient hydrogen intermediates for the next Heyrovsky/Tafel steps.<sup>[54,56]</sup> Besides water dissociation ability,  $\Delta G_{H^*}$  is another crucial descriptor for the HER process.<sup>[57]</sup> In the subsequent step, the Ru-N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> and N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> exhibited more negative  $\Delta G_{H^*}$  values of -0.27 and −0.38 eV, respectively, than Ru<sub>0.91</sub>Ni<sub>0.09</sub>-N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>, inferring excessive strong H binding energy to allow its recombination and release of  $H_2$ . Meanwhile, an optimal  $\Delta G_{H^*}$  value of -0.17 eV for Ru<sub>0.91</sub>Ni<sub>0.09</sub>-N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>, which was close to the thermoneutral value, indicated neither too weak nor strong H\* adsorption energy. Furthermore, among all possible active sites on the  $Ru_{0.91}Ni_{0.09}$ -N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> model, the Ru site with  $\Delta G_{H^*}$  of -0.17 eV

was primarily accounted as the main active center for catalyzing the HER process, followed by O (-0.24 eV), N (-0.30 eV), and Ni (-0.40 eV) sites (Figure 5j). Considering the HzOR, as reported by previous studies,[58,59] this process consists of four elementary steps, in which the final N<sub>2</sub> gas is formed via the dehydrogenation step ( ${}^*N_2H_4 \rightarrow {}^*N_2H_3 \rightarrow {}^*N_2H_2 \rightarrow {}^*N_2H \rightarrow$ \*N2). Free energy diagrams of HzOR (Figure S43, Supporting Information) showed that adsorption energies of Ru<sub>0.91</sub>Ni<sub>0.09</sub>-N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>, Ru-N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>, and N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> for N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> molecules were  $\approx$  -0.83, -1.95 and -2.70 eV, respectively. More negative values of Ru<sub>0.91</sub>Ni<sub>0.09</sub>-N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> and Ru-N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> indicate a stronger adsorption ability on their surfaces, which is thermodynamically

beneficial for subsequent dehydrogenation reactions. The dehydrogenation of \*N2H3 with energy barriers of 0.89 and 0.58 eV was the RDS on N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> and Ru<sub>0.91</sub>Ni<sub>0.09</sub>-N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>, respectively, while the release of \*N2 with an energy barrier of 0.77 eV was the RDS for Ru-N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>. Caused by the pivotal role of Ni in adjusting the electronic structure of Ru atoms to balance the binding energies of reaction intermediates, the Ru<sub>0.91</sub>Ni<sub>0.09</sub>-N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> achieved the lowest energy barrier. Thus, it was the most active catalyst toward HzOR. From the above-mentioned results, the well-designed Ru<sub>0.91</sub>Ni<sub>0.09</sub>-N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> material with secured unique electronic configuration regulated Ru d-band center, and directionally fast electron transfer not only well

accelerated H<sub>2</sub>O activation/dissociation to offer adequate proton source and favorable  $H_{\ast}$  adsorption energy, but also excellently boosted the sluggish HzOR kinetics, thereby acting as an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for promoting the performance of hydrazine-assisted hydrogen production.

Encouraged by prospective HER and HzOR outputs, we constructed a symmetric two-electrode cell (in the inset of Figure 6a) utilizing Ru<sub>0.91</sub>Ni<sub>0.09</sub>-N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> catalyst as cathode and anode to produce green hydrogen in an electrolyte medium of  $1.0 \text{ M KOH} + 0.5 \text{ M N}_2\text{H}_4$ . Due to the concurrent potential occurring between HER and HzOR region, the Ru<sub>0.91</sub>Ni<sub>0.09</sub>-N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2(+,-)</sub> system could simultaneously occur without any external sources (Video S1, Supporting Information). However, there was an insignificantly negative effect on HER activity due to an overlapping potential between HER and HzOR regions (Figure S44, Supporting Information). The Ru<sub>0.91</sub>Ni<sub>0.09</sub>-N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2(+,-)</sub> cell demonstrated a higher hydrazine-assisted hydrogen production performance than  $Pt/C_{(+,\cdot)}$  cell. It required a small cell potential of 0.02, 0.05, and 0.1 V to reach 10, 50, and 100 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, much smaller than those of  $Pt/C_{(+,\cdot)}$  (0.33, 0.57, and 0.79 V) (Figure 6b) and highly comparable to recently reported bifunctional overall hydrazine splitting (OHzS) electrocatalysts (Figure 6c; Table S5, Supporting Information). The OHzS activity of Ru<sub>0.91</sub>Ni<sub>0.09</sub>. N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2(+,-)</sub> outperformed the overall water splitting (OWS)

<span id="page-10-0"></span>(Figure 6d; Figure S45, Supporting Information), thus achieving superior energy efficiency as shown in Figure \$46 (Supporting Information). Specifically, the electricity expense of the OHzS required only 0.17 and 0.35 kWh m<sup>-3</sup> H<sub>2</sub> at 70 and 150 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, respectively, representing reductions of 4.65 and 5.01 kWh m<sup>-3</sup> H<sub>2</sub> compared to conventional OWS (Figure 6e). This suggests a significantly decreased energy consumption for hydrogen production caused by HzOR assistance instead of sluggish OER kinetics. The Faradaic efficiency of  $Ru_{0.91}Ni_{0.09}$ -N/O-Ti $_3C_{2(+,\cdot)}$  cell was found to be 97.6% and 96.9% for  $\rm H_2$  and  $\rm N_2$  gases, respectively, by the water replacement method (Figure 6f; Figure S47, Supporting Information). Chronoamperometric measurement exhibited a robust durability of Ru<sub>0.91</sub>Ni<sub>0.09</sub>-N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2(+,-)</sub> with a high current retention rate of 85.0% over 60 h of continuous operation at 50 mA cm  $^{-2}$ , whereas the Pt/C $_{(+,\cdot)}$  system showed a rapid decay after 35 h of operation (Figure 6g). The Ru<sub>0.91</sub>Ni<sub>0.09</sub>-N/O- $Ti_3C_{2(+,\cdot)}$  system toward OHzS at quasi-industrial aspects was demonstrated since it could operate at industrial-level current densities of 0.5 and 1.0 A cm<sup>-2</sup> with required potentials of 0.52 and 0.92 V, respectively (Figure 6h), pushing forward its practical application. Moreover, the cell exhibited fair stability under industrial-current density despite a refreshing requirement for the electrolyte medium to maintain hydrazine concentration (Figure 6i).

#### 3. Conclusion

In this work, we developed a highly efficient and robust electrocatalyst derived from Ru<sub>0.91</sub>Ni<sub>0.09</sub> nanoclusters uniformly confined on an N/O-terminated Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> platform for boosting both HER and HzOR in an alkaline medium. The featured Ru<sub>0.91</sub>Ni<sub>0.09</sub>-N/O-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> structure provides a distinctive porous hierarchical framework exposing rich-accessible active centers and accelerating fast electrolyte/electron transfer. Experimental and theoretical results verified the internal polarization field at the interface with a favorable free energy profile, facilitated electron transfer, and regulated d-band centers, all of which are highly beneficial for effectively accelerating HER and HzOR performances. The  $Ru_{0.91}Ni_{0.09}$ -N/O-Ti $_3C_2$  catalyst exhibited an exceptional OHzS activity via required cell voltages of 0.02 and 0.92 V to reach 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> and 1.0 A cm<sup>-2</sup>, respectively, surpassing recently reported catalysts. This work is expected to provide an efficient approach to designing robust and active electrocatalysts for hydrazine-assisted hydrogen production in alkaline media toward green and clean energy applications.

Preparation of Porous N/O- $Ti_3C_2$  Material: First, a stable  $Ti_3C_2T_x$  MX-ene colloid was prepared following our previous reports<sup>[28,29]</sup> and stored in a fridge before use. Melamine formaldehyde (MF) spheres were synthe-

sized according to a published method.  $^{[26]}$  To prepare porous nitrogendoped  $\text{Ti}_3\text{C}_2\text{T}_x$  MXene, a stable colloid of  $\text{Ti}_3\text{C}_2\text{T}_x$  MXene (10 mg mL $^{-1}$ ) was mixed with MF sphere dispersion at a mass ratio of 1:8 and stirred for 20 min at room temperature. A dark green flocculation immediately occurred due to electrostatic attractions. Solid precipitation was then collected via centrifugation and freeze-drying steps. The collected sample was then annealed at 550 °C to remove MF for 2 h at a ramping rate of 2 °C min $^{-1}$  in Ar atmosphere. The obtained material was denoted as N/O-Ti $_3\text{C}_2$ .

Preparation of  $Ru_{0.91}Ni_{0.09}$ -N/O- $Ti_3C_2$  Material: First, 50 mg of asprepared N/O- $Ti_3C_x$  materials were dispersed into 25 mL DI water under ultrasonication for 30 min. After that, 5 mL DI water containing a mixture of 5 mg Ni(OCOCH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> and 15 mg RuCl<sub>3</sub>×xH<sub>2</sub>O was added into the above suspension under vigorous stirring for 5 h. The suspension was then freeze-dried for at least 48 h. The obtained powder was further placed in a quartz boat in the middle of a tube furnace and pyrolyzed at 350 °C for 2 h at a ramp of 2 °C min<sup>-1</sup> under Ar/H<sub>2</sub> (9:1) atmosphere, forming  $Ru_{0.91}Ni_{0.09}$ -N/O- $Ti_3C_2$  material. For comparison, Ru-N/O- $Ti_3C_2$  and Ni-N/O- $Ti_3C_2$  materials were synthesized using the same method without the addition of Ru and Ni sources, respectively.

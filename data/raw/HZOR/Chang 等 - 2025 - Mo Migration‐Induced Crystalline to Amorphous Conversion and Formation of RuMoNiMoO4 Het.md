**Abstract:** Manipulating the atomic structure of the catalyst and tailoring the dissociative water-hydrogen bonding network at the catalyst-electrolyte interface is essential for propelling alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR), but remains a great challenge. Herein, we constructed an advanced a-RuMo/NiMoO<sub>4</sub>/NF heterogeneous electrocatalyst with amorphous RuMo alloy nanoclusters anchored to amorphous NiMoO4 skeletons on Ni foam by a heteroatom implantation strategy. Theoretical calculations and in situ Raman tests show that the amorphous and alloying structure of a-RuMo/ NiMoO<sub>4</sub>/NF not only induces the directional evolution of interfacial H<sub>2</sub>O, but also lowers the d-band center (from -0.43 to -2.22 eV) of a-RuMo/NiMoO<sub>4</sub>/NF, the Gibbs free energy of hydrogen adsorption ( $\Delta G_{H*}$ , from -1.29 to -0.06 eV), and the energy barrier of HzOR  $(\Delta G_{N2(g)} = 1.50 \text{ eV} \text{ to } \Delta G_{N2^*} = 0.47 \text{ eV})$ . Profiting from these favorable factors, the a-RuMo/NiMoO<sub>4</sub>/NF exhibits excellent electrocatalytic performances, especially at large current densities, with an overpotential of 13 and 129 mV to reach 10 and 1000 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> for HER. While for HzOR, it needs only -91 and 276 mV to deliver 10 and 500 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, respectively. Further, the constructed a-RuMo/NiMoO<sub>4</sub>/NF | a-RuMo/NiMoO<sub>4</sub>/NF electrolyzer demands only 7 and 420 mV to afford 10 and  $500 \text{ mA cm}^{-2}$ .

#### Introduction

Electrochemical overall water splitting (OWS) is one of the most promising strategies for highly-efficient production of renewable hydrogen sources,<sup>[1]</sup> but the slow reaction kinetics and high theoretical potential (1.23 V vs. RHE) of its anode

oxygen evolution reaction (OER) limit the practical application of OWS technology. [2] Although diverse OER electrocatalysts have been developed, the cell voltage of OWS in actual electrolyzer is still unsatisfactory. [3] Recently, electrocatalytic oxidation of thermodynamically more favorable small molecules (such as alcohols, amines, sulfoxide, and hydrazine) has been proposed as a promising alternative to OER. Among them, the hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR,  $N_2H_4+4OH^-=N_2+4H_2O$ ) has attracted extensive attention because of its low theoretical potential (-0.33 V vs. RHE) and the higher safety of the products. Moreover, the only by-product of HzOR is inert  $N_2$  (rather than  $O_2$ , which is at risk of exploding when mixed with  $H_2$ ), so the HzOR can further couple with hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) for application in membrane-free electrolyzers. Therefore, the utilization of HzOR-assisted water splitting can effectively enhance H<sub>2</sub> production, minimize energy consumption, [4] and consume hydrazine in industrial waste water, thereby enhancing economic efficiency and reducing environmental pollution.<sup>[5]</sup> So far, various electrocatalysts have been explored, but most of them exhibit attractive performance exclusively in HzOR or HER, and operate only at small current densities. [6] Actually, industrial-scale water splitting prefers bifunctional electrocatalysts that can operate stably at high current densities (~500 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>), to ensure low operating cost and high H<sub>2</sub> yield. Therefore, the development of advanced bifunctional HER and HzOR electrocatalysts with large current for hydrazine-assisted overall water splitting is highly desired.

Essentially, the initiation of electrocatalytic HER/HzOR and the evolution of reaction intermediates both occur at the surface of a given catalyst, so the surface atomic structure is crucial for propelling these reactions, and may directly determine the absorption/desorption energies of certain key intermediates.<sup>[7]</sup> Besides, in alkaline environments, reactant water molecules may be attracted to the hydrogen bonding network of interfacial water, forming 4-coordinated hydrogen bonded water (4-HBW) and 2-coordinated hydrogen bonded water (2-HBW).[8] This intrinsic interaction prevents the water molecules from reaching the catalyst surface and the diffusion of intermediates into the bulk solution, which in turn leads to the deactivation of the catalyst surface active sites.<sup>[9]</sup> Therefore, the rational design of the surface atomic structure of the catalyst and the microenvironment of the interfacial water is vital. Recent studies have shown that amorphization design

can relax the inherent bonding between atoms to form unique atomic arrangements and tailored coordination environments, thus rationally altering their intrinsic physicochemical properties as well as the microenvironment of interfacial water molecules to significantly enhance catalytic activity. For instance, amorphous Ru-based materials possess a more flexible and disordered atomic arrangement when compared to the crystalline Ru, which can provide multiple pathways for ion/water molecule migration.[10] Meanwhile, it also has a large number of dangling bonds which can serve as trap sites for trapping electrons/water molecules, and abundant coordination-unsaturated surface atoms which can serve as active sites to enhance the intrinsic catalytic activity.[11] Therefore, by forming amorphous Ru, not only more catalytically active sites can be released, but also the interfacial water molecules can be directional evolved, thereby promoting the efficient operation of catalytic reactions. So far, several amorphous structures have been constructed, but the reported works are focused on transition metal compounds,[12] while the amorphization of noble metals has rarely been reported and is much more difficult due to their stronger metallic bonds.

Among the various amorphization strategies, such as rapid cooling/reduction, low-temperature reaction, plasma treatment and ball-milling methods,[13] the heteroatom implantation strategy exhibits a particular charm because of its great controllability over the size and morphology of the catalyst and does not require special reagents, devices, and equipment.[14] As for Ru, it was reported that it has a strong affinity for Mo, so the introduction of Mo may disturb the nucleation, growth and directional arrangement of Ru atoms, thereby contributing to irregular atomic sequence and amorphous Ru nanostructure.[15] In particular, although the metal Ru, with its unique electronic structure, exhibits excellent electrocatalytic properties in numerous catalytic reactions such as HER and HzOR, it still shows somewhat weak water dissociation ability and catalytic stability in alkaline environments. While Mo, as an oxyphilic metallic element, exhibits relatively strong Mo-water binding.[16] Previous work also reported that introducing Mo atoms into metal nanoclusters can promote the rapid and spontaneous adsorption of H2O molecules to Mo sites, thereby effectively reducing the Gibbs free energy of the subsequent dissociation process.[17] Therefore, the integration of Ru and Mo may not only modulate the atomic sequence of Ru, but is also expected to optimize the electronic structure of Ru, and thus achieve excellent electrocatalytic performance.

Inspired by these investigations, herein, we report a new type of heterogeneous catalyst integrating amorphous and alloyed structures, i.e., amorphous RuMo alloy nanoclusters embedded on the surface of amorphous NiMoO4 hollow nanorods (labelled as a-RuMo/NiMoO4/NF), via a heteroatom implantation strategy. Systematic comparative experiments and characterizations show that this unique structure mainly comes from the migration and segregation of Mo atoms in NiMoO4 during programmed annealing process,[18] which are then implanted into the Ru lattice on the surface of NiMoO4, thus resulting in the amorphous RuMo nanoclusters and amorphous NiMoO4 hollow nanorod structure. Benefiting from this special structure, the a-RuMo/NiMoO4/ NF only needs overpotentials of 13 and 129 mV to reach 10 and 1000 mAcm <sup>2</sup> for HER. While for HzOR, it also only requires 91 mV and 276 mV to reach 10 and 500 mAcm <sup>2</sup> Except for activity, it can operate stably for 100 h at a high current density of 500 mAcm <sup>2</sup> without significant attenuation for both HER and HzOR, indicative of its long-term electrocatalytic stability. When further assembled to hydrazine-assisted overall water splitting, the constructed a-RuMo/NiMoO4/NFj j a-RuMo/NiMoO4/NF requests only 7 and 420 mV to deliver 10 and 500 mAcm <sup>2</sup> , confirming the remarkable electrocatalytic bifunctionality and hydrazineassisted overall water splitting ability of the a-RuMo/ NiMoO4/NF catalyst. In situ Raman spectroscopy tests and density functional theory (DFT) calculations collectively reveal that such superiority should mainly result from the amorphous construction and formation of RuMo alloy for the a-RuMo/NiMoO4/NF. Specifically, the amorphous structure of a-RuMo/NiMoO4/NF breaks the network of the interfacial water layer and induces the directional transformation of 4-HBW into interfacial free water molecules. This allows the free water molecules to act as "co-catalysts" to effectively accelerate the Volmer process of HER. Moreover, compared to the crystalline RuMo cluster on crystalline NiMoO4 (i.e., c-RuMo/NiMoO4) and amorphous Ru cluster on amorphous NiMoO4 (i.e., a-Ru/NiMoO4), the a-RuMo/NiMoO4 shows increased electron transfer from the RuMo nanoclusters to the NiMoO4 skeleton (3.04 e vs. 2.18 e for the a-Ru/NiMoO4 and 2.17 e for the c-RuMo/ NiMoO4), and down-shifted position of d-band center ( 2.22 eV vs. 0.43 eV for the a-Ru/NiMoO4 and 1.99 eV for the c-RuMo/NiMoO4). This implies an increase in the filling of electrons in the antibonding orbitals, which would improve the adsorption/desorption behavior of the catalytic sites. Consequently, reduced Gibbs free energy of hydrogen adsorption (ΔGH\*, 0.06 eV vs. 1.29 eV for the a-Ru/ NiMoO4 and 0.70 eV for the c-RuMo/NiMoO4) and energy barrier of HzOR (0.47 eV vs. 1.50 eV for the a-Ru/NiMoO4 and 0.95 eV for the c-RuMo/NiMoO4) are realized, finally contributing to the remarkable hydrazine-assisted water splitting performance for the a-RuMo/NiMoO4/NF.

#### *Results and Discussion*

Figure 1a displays the schematic diagram of the synthesis process of a-RuMo/NiMoO4/NF. Firstly, NiMoO4 nanorod array was grown in situ on the nickel foam skeleton (labelled as NiMoO4/NF) using nickel foam as the nickel source by a hydrothermal method (Figure S1). In this process, part of Mo6<sup>+</sup> was reduced to Mo5<sup>+</sup> by ethanol, resulting in abundant vacancies. This provided favorable conditions for the subsequent adsorption of Ru<sup>3</sup><sup>+</sup> on the surface of NiMoO4 nanorods via electrostatic interactions (Figure S2). Thus next, Ru<sup>3</sup><sup>+</sup>/NiMoO4/NF can be obtained by impregnating NiMoO4/NF in RuCl3 solution. Finally, the Ru<sup>3</sup><sup>+</sup>/ NiMoO4/NF was reduced at 350 °C for 2 h under reducing atmosphere to obtain the a-RuMo/NiMoO4/NF. Figure 1b shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the NiMoO4/

NF, Ru<sup>3</sup><sup>+</sup>/NiMoO4/NF and a-RuMo/NiMoO4/NF. It can be seen that the initial NiMoO4/NF and Ru3<sup>+</sup>/NiMoO4/NF show obvious diffraction peaks belonging to NiMoO4 (JCPDS 13-0128), indicative of their goodish crystallinity. However, no diffraction peak was detected after annealing treatment, signifying an amorphous structure for the

a-RuMo/NiMoO4/NF. To elucidate the morphology and microstructure features of the a-RuMo/NiMoO4/NF, we performed further characterization. Figure 1c and 1d give the scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the a-RuMo/NiMoO4/ NF, and it can be clearly seen that the a-RuMo/NiMoO4/NF has a three-dimensional (3D) nanorod array morphology and the nanorod has a hollow structure. Moreover, there are large voids between these nanorods (Figure S3). This unique 3D nanorod array structure may promote charge/mass transfer and facilitate the rapid desorption of bubbles from the catalyst surface. Furthermore, wettability studies show that the pure Ni foam is hydrophobic with a contact angle of 74.9°, whereas the a-RuMo/NiMoO4/NF has a super hydrophilic surface with a contact angle of 0° (Figure 1e), which can help to enhance the affinity and penetration of the electrolyte.

Further spherical aberration-corrected high-angle annular dark-field scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM) images in Figure 1f and Figure S4 reveal an amorphous state for the a-RuMo/NiMoO4/NF, with large quantities of amorphous nanoclusters anchored onto the surface of the amorphous substrate. The corresponding Fast Fourier transform (FFT) analysis in the inset of Figure 1f verifies this amorphous state. Figure 1g displays the structural model of a-RuMo/ NiMoO4. By further line-scan analyses of the magnified STEM image, the bright spots in the nanoclusters are identified as Ru and Mo (Figure 1h and i), suggesting that it is RuMo nanoclusters that are anchored onto the surface of the nanorods. Further evidence comes from EDS line-scan analysis. As shown in Figure 1j–l, compared to Ni and O, Mo and Ru show a more forward starting point and higher content, indicating that Mo and Ru elements are distributed on the surface of the nanorods. Based on the analyses above, the nanorod should be NiMoO4 with RuMo nanoclusters loaded on its surface, and both of which are amorphous. Figure 1m displays the elemental mapping images of the a-RuMo/NiMoO4/NF, which exhibits the uniform distribution of Ru, Mo, Ni, and O elements, with an obvious hollow structure. By inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) test, the atomic percent of Ru is estimated to be 8.3 at%. These characterizations validate the successful preparation of heterogeneous and amorphous a-RuMo/NiMoO4/NF hollow nanoroad arrays.

To probe the electronic environment of different atoms in the a-RuMo/NiMoO4/NF, we performed X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) analyses. Figure 2a shows the Ru K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra of the a-RuMo/NiMoO4/NF, Ru foil, and RuO2. It can be seen that the absorption energy (*E0*) of Ru in the a-RuMo/NiMoO4/NF is close to that of the Ru foil, indicating that the Ru atoms exist mainly in a metallic state in the a-RuMo/NiMoO4/NF. To further analyze the local structure of Ru, the k2 -weighted extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra of Ru K-edge were obtained by Fourier transform. As shown in Figure 2b, the peak located at 2.42 Å is attributed to Ru Ru coordination and the peak at 1.44 Å originates from Ru O bond. The a-RuMo/ NiMoO4/NF exhibits a main peak at 2.39 Å, which should be affiliated to Ru Ru coordination. While the slightly negative offset position for the a-RuMo/NiMoO4/NF may be attributed to the influence of the Mo.[19] In other words, Ru Mo coordination is formed. By data fitting, the coordination number of Ru Ru/Mo was calculated to be 7.2 (Table S1). Further bonding information of Ru is vividly demonstrated by the small wavelet transformation, where the a-RuMo/ NiMoO4/NF shows a strong Ru Ru/Mo peak and a weak Ru O peak, confirming that the Ru exists mainly in metallic state in the a-RuMo/NiMoO4/NF (Figure 2c). Except for Ru, Figure 2d and e present the Mo K-edge XANES and EXAFS spectra, respectively. From Figure 2d, it can be seen that the *E0* of Mo in a-RuMo/NiMoO4/NF lies between Mo foil and MoO2, indicating the Mo in a-RuMo/NiMoO4/NF is present in a slightly oxidized state. This is reasonable since the Mo atoms in a-RuMo/NiMoO4/NF exist in both NiMoO4 (oxidation state) and Mo Mo/Ru (metallic state). This can be further confirmed by EXAFS spectra. As displayed in Figure 2e, the peak at 1.53–1.63 Å is attributed to Mo O coordination while the peak at 2.42 Å is affiliated to Mo Mo. The a-RuMo/NiMoO4/NF shows both of these two peaks, suggesting the presence of both Mo O bond and metallic Mo, in good consisting with the slightly oxidized state of Mo above. Specially, both of these two peaks show a slight positive shift, which should result from its amorphous structure and the effect of Ru, respectively.[15,20] Further EXAFS fitting data in Table S2 and small wavelet transformation images in Figure 2f verify the co-existence of Mo Mo/Ru and Mo O bonds in the a-RuMo/NiMoO4/NF. Further X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses in Figure 2g, 2 h and Figure S5 confirms the successful synthesis of amorphous RuMo clusters coupled to the amorphous NiMoO4 (see Figure S5 for details).

So far, heterogeneous catalysts integrating amorphous and alloyed structures have been rarely reported. To investigate the formation mechanism, we conducted some comparative experiments (Figure 3a). Firstly, to investigate the effect of Ru on the growth process, the NiMoO4 skeleton (without adsorbed Ru<sup>3</sup><sup>+</sup>) was annealed directly in reducing H2 atmosphere, and amorphous Ni/NiO/MoO3 x/NF was obtained (Figure S6). Secondly, to ascertain the effect of annealing atmosphere on the formation of the amorphous structure, the Ru<sup>3</sup><sup>+</sup>/NiMoO4/NF precursor was annealed in inert N2 atmosphere, and crystalline RuO2/NiMoO4/NF was obtained (Figure S7). Obviously, both the introduction of Ru and the reducing annealing atmosphere play crucial roles in the formation of amorphous a-RuMo/NiMoO4/NF structure. According to the literature, NiMoO4 is susceptible to the Kirkendall effect at high temperatures in reducing atmosphere and undergoes atomic migration and precipitation.[18,21] Therefore, when NiMoO4/NF was annealed directly in H2 atmosphere, Ni atoms migrated outward and precipitated continuously, which would disturb the atomic sequence of NiMoO4/NF, so amorphous Ni/NiO/ MoO3 x/NF was obtained. When Ru<sup>3</sup><sup>+</sup>/NiMoO4/NF was annealed in N2 atmosphere, there was no atomic migration and precipitation, so the crystalline RuO2/NiMoO4/NF was obtained. In particular, when Ru<sup>3</sup><sup>+</sup>/NiMoO4/NF was annealed in H2 atmosphere, Mo atom migrates outward

continuously, disturbing the crystal structure of NiMoO4 and affecting the nucleation/growth of Ru atoms, thus obtaining a-RuMo/NiMoO4/NF. As for the reason that Ni migrates outward when NiMoO4/NF is annealed but Mo migrates outward when Ru<sup>3</sup><sup>+</sup>/NiMoO4/NF is annealed (in reducing atmosphere), this may be attributed to the affinity effect between Ru and Mo atoms.[15,22] In other words, Ru atoms induce the outward migration of Mo atoms, as confirmed by the Ru Mo coordination in XAS analyses. Figure 3b schematically illustrates the formation mechanism of a-RuMo/NiMoO4/NF. That is, the introduction of Ru induces the outward migration of Mo in NiMoO4 during annealing, which interferes with the atomic sequence of NiMoO4 and thus leads to amorphous NiMoO4. Meanwhile, the external Mo atoms disturb the directional atomic sequence of Ru, so that amorphous RuMo alloy nano-

clusters are obtained. Increasing the annealing temperature to 450 and 550 °C, similar amorphous structures were obtained, confirming above atomic migration mechanism (Figure S8).

Additionally, as comparison, we also prepared crystalline RuMo/NiMoO4/NF (c-RuMo/NiMoO4/NF). The HRTEM, HADDF-STEM and XRD characterizations in Figure S9, S10 and S11 confirm the construction of crystalline RuMo and crystalline NiMoO4. Further XPS analyses show that compared to the c-RuMo/NiMoO4/NF, more electrons are transferred from RuMo alloy to NiMoO4 substrate in the a-RuMo/NiMoO4/NF (Figure S12a–c), which may result from the amorphous structure of RuMo alloy. That is, the amorphous RuMo alloy is more easily to supply electrons due to its nonlinear atomic arrangement.[23]

To explore the hydrazine-assisted water splitting performance of the a-RuMo/NiMoO<sub>4</sub>/NF, we performed HER and HzOR tests in N<sub>2</sub>-saturated 1.0 M KOH and 1.0 M KOH+0.5 M N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> electrolytes, respectively. Before formal tests, the content of Ru<sup>3+</sup> was optimized (Figure S13), and a-RuMo/NiMoO<sub>4</sub>/NF-8.3 was designated as the typical sample for subsequent tests. Figure 4a exhibits the HER polarization curve of the a-RuMo/NiMoO<sub>4</sub>/NF (i.e., a-RuMo/NiMoO<sub>4</sub>/NF-8.3), and compared to that of the c-RuMo/NiMoO<sub>4</sub>/NF, NiMoO<sub>4</sub>/NF, Ru/C/NF and commercial 20 % Pt/C/NF catalysts. It can be seen that the a-RuMo/NiMoO<sub>4</sub>/NF has the optimal catalytic activity, requiring an overpotential of only 13 mV to reach 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> (η<sub>10</sub>), while the NiMoO<sub>4</sub>/NF shows the worst activity (156 mV) (Figure 4b), Meanwhile, the c-RuMo/NiMoO<sub>4</sub>/NF requests only

31 mV, suggesting that the incorporation of Ru and formation of amorphous RuMo nanoclusters significantly boosted the HER electrocatalytic activity of the a-RuMo/NiMoO<sub>4</sub>/NF. Notably, even at larger current densities of 500 and 1000 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, the a-RuMo/NiMoO<sub>4</sub>/NF also requires smaller overpotentials (96 and 129 mV) than those of the NiMoO<sub>4</sub>/NF (372 and 438 mV), c-RuMo/NiMoO<sub>4</sub>/NF (111 and 156 mV), Ru/C/NF (147 and 216 mV) and commercial 20 % Pt/C/NF(117 and 176 mV), as well as many of recently-reported electrocatalysts (Figure S14 and Table S3). Meanwhile, the a-RuMo/NiMoO<sub>4</sub>/NF still demonstrates smaller Tafel slope (32 mVdec<sup>-1</sup>) than that of the NiMoO<sub>4</sub>/NF (167 mVdec<sup>-1</sup>), c-RuMo/NiMoO<sub>4</sub>/NF (60 mVdec<sup>-1</sup>), Ru/C/NF (46 mVdec<sup>-1</sup>) and 20 % Pt/C/NF (39 mVdec<sup>-1</sup>) (Figure 4c), indicative of fast HER kinetics for the a-RuMo/

NiMoO4/NF. These results fully justify its potential for commercial HER application with low overpotential, rapid reaction kinetics and large current density. Apart from HER, the a-RuMo/NiMoO4/NF also possesses excellent electrocatalytic HzOR performance. Considering that the concentration of N2H4 has a certain effect on the catalytic activity of HzOR, we first performed a concentration optimization test, and 0.5 M N2H4 was designated as the reaction concentration ultimately (Figure S15). Figure 4d gives the polarization curves of these five catalysts, which clearly shows that the a-RuMo/NiMoO4/NF possesses a large current, whereas NiMoO4/NF has a tiny anodic current. Moreover, the a-RuMo/NiMoO4/NF only needs a small potential of 91 mV to reach 10 mAcm <sup>2</sup> . This value is remarkably superior to the NiMoO4/NF (23 mV), c-RuMo/NiMoO4/NF ( 81 mV), Ru/C/NF ( 59 mV), 20% Pt/C/NF ( 46 mV), and most of the reported electrocatalysts so far (Figure S16 and Table S4), meaning the outstanding HzOR electrocatalytic performance of the a-RuMo/NiMoO4/NF. Remarkably, to deliver larger current densities of 100 and 500 mAcm <sup>2</sup> , the a-RuMo/NiMoO4/NF requires only 20 (*η*100) and 276 mV (*η*500), respectively, outperforming the c-RuMo/NiMoO4/NF, Ru/C/NF and 20% Pt/C/NF (Figure 4e). Moreover, the a-RuMo/NiMoO4/NF also possesses the optimal Tafel slope (23 mVdec <sup>1</sup> ) among these five catalysts, signifying fast HzOR kinetics for the a-RuMo/NiMoO4/NF (Figure 4f).

Considering the practical applications and the abundance of seawater on earth, we further investigated the electrocatalytic HER and HzOR performance of the

a-RuMo/NiMoO4/NF in alkaline simulated seawater (1.0 M KOH+0.5 M NaCl for HER, and 1.0 M KOH+0.5 M N2H4 +0.5 M NaCl for HzOR) and natural seawater (1.0 M KOH +seawater for HER, and 1.0 M KOH+0.5 M N2H4+seawater for HzOR). Pleasingly, the a- RuMo/NiMoO4/NF shows almost constant electrocatalytic HER and HzOR activity in alkaline simulated seawater and natural seawater when compared with those in 1.0 M KOH, indicating the goodish application potential of the a-RuMo/NiMoO4/NF in seawater (Figure 4g and S17). In addition to electrocatalytic activity, we further explored the electrocatalytic stability of the a-RuMo/NiMoO4/NF for both HER and HzOR (considering the continues consummation of N2H4 during stability test, a circulation device was used to maintain the N2H4 concentration (Figure S18). As shown in Figure 4h, there is hardly potential deterioration in up to 100 h of testing at a large current density of 500 mAcm <sup>2</sup> , indicating the longterm electrocatalytic stability of the a-RuMo/NiMoO4/NF. One step forward, to characterize the structural stability of the catalyst, we performed SEM, XRD, XPS, and Raman characterizations on the a-RuMo/NiMoO4/NF catalyst after stability test. SEM images showed that the a-RuMo/ NiMoO4/NF retained its nanorod arrays morphology (Figure S19 and Figure S20). While XRD patterns indicated that it was still in an amorphous state (Figure S21a and S22a). Nevertheless, XPS and Raman results showed that some Mo atoms was oxidized and etched, along with the formation of Ni(OH)2 (see Figure S21–S23 for details). Importantly, its NiMoO4 skeleton remains, and the surface chemical states of Ru and Ni are basically preserved. So no obvious attenuation was observed during long-term stability test.

To ascertain the reasons for the remarkable electrocatalytic bifunctionality of the a-RuMo/NiMoO4/NF, we performed mass activity (MA) (Figure S24), electrochemical double-layer capacitance (Cdl) (Figure S25), turn over frequency (TOF) (Figure S26) and impedance spectroscopy (EIS) (Figure S27 and S28) calculations and tests firstly. The results show that compared to the NiMoO4/NF, c-RuMo/ NiMoO4/NF and 20% Pt/C/NF, the a-RuMo/NiMoO4/NF also has the largest MA, Cdl value, TOF value and the smallest charge transfer resistance (Table S5 and S6), indicating that the a-RuMo/NiMoO4/NF has higher number of active sites, intrinsic catalytic activity and faster interfacial charge transfer capability, thus contributing to the significant reaction kinetics superiority of the a-RuMo/NiMoO4/ NF.

Particularly, to elucidate the effect of the amorphous structure on the conversion behavior of interfacial water molecules, we performed in situ Raman tests. As shown in Figure 5a and Figure S29, the observed peak located between 2800 and 3800 cm <sup>1</sup> is the O H stretching modes of water molecules.[24] Then by means of Gaussian fitting, the O H stretching band can be deconvoluted into three different stretching vibrational modes: 4-HBW, 2-HBW, and free water.[25] Of these three kinds of water, the free water on the catalyst surface can act as a "co-catalyst" in HER, effectively accelerating the Volmer process of HER, and is therefore more favorable. For c-RuMo/NiMoO4, the population of free water remains essentially constant with the enhancement of the negative electric field (Figure 5b). While for a-RuMo/NiMoO4, the population of free water increases from 5.8% to 13.3%, and the population of 4-HBW decreases from 48.0% to 39.4%. Such dynamic evolution of 4-HBW to free water may be attributed to the disordered arrangement of atoms on the surface of the a-RuMo/NiMoO4 and the presence of a large number of dangling bonds (Figure 5c). Consequently, remarkable electrocatalytic performances are achieved for the a-RuMo/

NiMoO4. To further investigate the effect of amorphous configuration and RuMo alloy on electrocatalytic HER and HzOR performance, we performed DFT calculation. Three structure models, i.e., crystalline RuMo cluster on crystalline NiMoO4 (i.e., c-RuMo/NiMoO4), amorphous RuMo cluster on amorphous NiMoO4 (i.e., a-RuMo/NiMoO4) and amorphous Ru cluster on amorphous NiMoO4 (i.e., a-Ru/ NiMoO4), are constructed. The optimized structures of these three models are shown in Figure S30. By differential charge density analysis, it can be seen that there is obvious electron transfer between the clusters and NiMoO4 substrate, and the electron flows from the cluster to the substrate (Figure 5d). Further, the a-RuMo/NiMoO4 shows an electron transfer number of 3.04 e , significantly larger than that of the a-Ru/ NiMoO4 (2.18 e ) and c-RuMo/NiMoO4 (2.17 e ), suggesting that both the amorphous structure and the formation of RuMo alloy promote electron transfer. This redistribution of interfacial electrons may affect the d-band centers and adsorption/desorption behaviors of corresponding catalysts. To check this issue, the partical density of states (PDOS) and d-band center of these catalysts are calculated. As shown in Figure 5e, a gradual downward shift of the d-states is observed, from 0.43 eV for the a-Ru/NiMoO4, 1.99 eV for the c-RuMo/NiMoO4, to 2.22 eV for the a-RuMo/ NiMoO4. Consequently, the free energy of adsorption H (ΔGH\*) was significantly weakened, from 1.29 eV for the a-Ru/NiMoO4 to 0.70 eV for the c-RuMo/NiMoO4, and to 0.06 eV for the a-RuMo/NiMoO4, indicating that the amorphous construction and formation of RuMo alloy greatly optimized the HER process of the a-RuMo/NiMoO4 (Figure 5f). As for HzOR, Figures 5g and h display the geometry of N2Hx adsorption and the Gibbs free energy profiles for the stepwise dehydrogenation process from N2H4 to N2, respectively. It can be seen that the dehydrogenation of \*HNN to \*N2 is the rate-determining step (RDS) for the a-RuMo/NiMoO4, with an adsorption-free energy of 0.47 eV. Whereas the RDS on the c-RuMo/NiMoO4 and a-Ru/NiMoO4 is \*N2 to N2, with an adsorption free energy of 0.95 eV and 1.50 eV, respectively. Clearly, the a-RuMo/ NiMoO4 possesses the lowest RDS energy barrier among these three catalysts, thereby contributing to the remarkable HzOR electrocatalytic performance of the a-RuMo/ NiMoO4. Based on the above calculations and in situ Raman tests, the introduction of Mo and the induced amorphous RuMo alloy significantly improved the adsorption/desorption behaviors of HER and HzOR intermediates as well as the directed evolution of 4-HBW into interfacial free water, thereby contributing to the outstanding electrocatalytic bifunctionality for the a-RuMo/NiMoO4.

Inspired by the excellent electrocatalytic HER and HzOR bifunctionality of the a-RuMo/NiMoO4/NF, we further assembled a hydrazine-assisted water splitting electrolyzer, with the a-RuMo/NiMoO4/NF as both the anode and cathode (Figure 6a). Impressively, the constructed a-RuMo/NiMoO4/NFj j a-RuMo/NiMoO4/NF device requires only 0.007 V to drive 10 mAcm <sup>2</sup> in 0.5 M N2H4+1.0 M KOH solution, far less than that of the commercial 20% Pt/ C/NFj j 20% Pt/C/NF (0.026 V) (Figure 6b). To reach larger current density of 100 and 500 mAcm <sup>2</sup> , the a-RuMo/ NiMoO4/NFj j a-RuMo/NiMoO4/NF electrolyzer needs only 0.12 and 0.42 V, outperforming the commercial 20% Pt/C/ NFj j 20% Pt/C/NF (0.29 and 1.29 V), highlighting the outstanding electrocatalytic ability of the a-RuMo/NiMoO4/NF. Additionally, as a comparison, we also tested the overall water splitting performance of the a-RuMo/NiMoO4/NF in an electrolyte without N2H4. As shown in Figure 6c–d, the required voltages are obviously larger than those tested in an electrolyte with N2H4, indicating that the introduction of N2H4 significantly reduced energy consumption. Figure 6e compares the cell voltage (at 10 mAcm <sup>2</sup> ) of the a-RuMo/ NiMoO4/NFjja-RuMo/NiMoO4/NF electrolyzer with some recently reported catalysts (Table S7), and it can be clearly seen that the a-RuMo/NiMoO4/NFjja-RuMo/NiMoO4/NF has the smallest cell voltage, confirming its remarkable hydrazine-assisted water splitting ability. Further stability test shows that the a-RuMo/NiMoO4/NFjja-RuMo/NiMoO4/ NF electrolyzer also owns robust electrocatalytic stability, with relevant voltage decay slightly after 100 h of chronopotentiometry (CP) test at 500 mAcm <sup>2</sup> (Figure 6f). To further evaluate the hydrogen production efficiency of the a-RuMo/ NiMoO4/NFjja-RuMo/NiMoO4/NF electrolyzer, the experimentally generated H2 and N2 were collected. As shown in Figure 6g and Figure 6h, the collected values closely match the theoretical ones, with corresponding Faraday efficiencies approaching 100%, confirming the promising application

prospect of the a-RuMo/NiMoO $_4$ /NF for hydrazine-assisted water splitting.

#### Conclusion

In summary, this work reports an advanced atomic migration activated electrocatalytic strategy, and achieves remarkable electrocatalytic HER, HzOR and hydrazine-assisted water splitting performances. Such superiority mainly results from the combined effect of the following factors: (1) the amorphization of RuMo alloy endow the catalyst with disordered surface atomic arrangement, reduces the coordination number of surface atoms, and improves the interfacial charge distribution, thereby boosting the number of active sites and electron transfer kinetics. (2) the amorphous construction and formation of RuMo alloy simultaneously promotes electron transfer from the RuMo nanoclusters to the NiMoO $_4$  skeleton, and optimizes the d-band center of

the a- RuMo/NiMoO<sub>4</sub>/NF, thereby reducing the Gibbs free energy of hydrogen adsorption and the energy barrier of HzOR. (3) the amorphous structure facilitates the directed evolution of 4-HBW to interfacial free water, which can act as a "co-catalyst" to efficiently accelerate the Volmer process of HER.

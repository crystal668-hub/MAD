**Alternate electrocatalytic reactions can turn pollutants into green fuels, offering an energy-efficient approach. Coupling hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR), with 4-nitrophenol hydrogenation (4-NPHR) is especially promising. Here, we report a bifunctional electrocatalyst composed of defect-rich Fe–Ru alloy clusters uniformly anchored on vanadium carbide (Fe**─**Ru**─**VC), synthesized via scalable ball milling and thermal annealing. Fe**─**Ru**─**VC exhibits excellent electrocatalytic activity toward both HzOR and 4-NPHR, requiring a low overpotential of 145 mV at 10 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> and a favorable Tafel slope of 68.9 mV dec<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> for HzOR, with stability exceeding 90 h in 1M KOH. For 1 mM 4-NPHR, superior Fe-Ru-VC performance is achieved −7.2 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> at 100 mV, highlighting its high efficiency. Furthermore, a paired H-cell electrolyzer (HzOR||4-NPHR) operates at only 200 mV to deliver 40 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2, underscoring its low energy demand. In situ Raman spectroscopy confirms the formation of Fe**─**Ru(OOH) as active sites, UV–Vis analysis confirms rapid 4-NP degradation, and DFT calculations demonstrate enhanced electronic interactions at the Ru**─**Fe junction, consistent with experimental observations. The outstanding activity is attributed to synergistic Fe-Ru interactions, the presence of zigzag edge defects, and the excellent conductivity of the VC support.**

## **1. Introduction**

The escalating demand for clean energy, propelled by rising petroleum use and deteriorating global pollution, has heightened the pursuit of renewable energy sources and alternative fuels. Hydrogen (H2) has emerged as a sustainable alternative fuel owing to its low CO2 emissions and high energy density (33.3 kWh kg<sup>−</sup>1), making it a great contender for sustainable energy applications and cleaner transportation.[\[1\]](#page-13-0) Although H2 production via water electrolysis has been practiced for over two centuries, its widespread integration with fuel cell technology for energy-efficient, cleaner transportation is significantly constrained by the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which relies on a kinetically sluggish four-electron transfer mechanism (4OH<sup>−</sup> → O2 + 2H2O + 4e<sup>−</sup>) that requires a high overpotential (1.23 V vs RHE).[\[2,3\]](#page-13-0) However, industrial-scale H2 production can be enabled by lowering the

voltage input (*<*1.7 V) and cost (*<*\$4 kg<sup>−</sup>1) via replacing OER with the thermodynamically favorable electrooxidation reactions of small molecules like urea, glucose, alcohols, ammonia, and hydrazine.[\[4,5\]](#page-13-0) Among them, the hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) in alkaline media proceeds rapidly and presents a promising strategy for improving the energy efficiency of electrochemical systems.[\[6,7\]](#page-13-0) Hydrazine (Hz), known for its high energy density (5.40 kW h L<sup>−</sup>1, 1 atm), finds its use as a rocket propellant. It is highly toxic and corrosive, posing serious risks to human health and the environment.[\[8\]](#page-13-0) Consequently, remediation of wastewater is essential from a sustainability perspective. Depending on system conditions, Hz can undergo either chemical decomposition (HzOR, N2H4 + 4 OH<sup>−</sup> → N2 + 2H2) or electrochemical oxidation (N2H4 + 4OH<sup>−</sup> → N2 + 4H2O + 4e<sup>−</sup>).[\[9\]](#page-13-0) Hz-assisted alkaline electrolysis offers dual benefits. It enables simultaneous wastewater treatment and tandem production of H2 and N2. Replacing the conventional OER with HzOR significantly reduces the operating voltage and energy consumption, improves overall system efficiency, and allows for the cathodic synthesis of valuable chemicals.[\[10,11\]](#page-13-0) Notably, HzOR exhibits a much lower theoretical thermodynamic oxidation potential (−0.33 V vs RHE) compared to OER (1.23 V vs RHE), resulting in a lower overpotential and enhanced H2/N2 co-generation. Therefore, the development of efficient and robust electrocatalysts for HzOR is vital for realizing low-energy hydrogen production and advancing sustainable energy technologies.[\[12,13\]](#page-13-0)

4-Nitrophenol (4-NP), a hazardous pollutant with carcinogenic and teratogenic properties, is a serious environmental threat due to its persistence and rapid accumulation in soil, leading to devastating ecological consequences.[\[14,15\]](#page-13-0) Its degradation remains a significant challenge in environmental chemistry, requiring innovative and sustainable solutions. The catalytic reduction of 4-NP to 4-aminophenol (4-AP), a crucial intermediate for pharmaceuticals like paracetamol, not only addresses its toxicity but also enables the green synthesis of valuable compounds.[\[16\]](#page-13-0) The practical application of electrocatalytic systems for 4-NP and Hz remediation is often hindered by their dependence on external power sources.[\[17\]](#page-13-0) A promising solution lies in coupling the HzOR with the electrochemical reduction of 4-NP to 4-AP, enabling autonomous, energy-efficient operation. This integrated approach not only addresses environmental concerns by degrading hazardous pollutants but also generates high-purity H2 and value-added products such as 4-AP and N2, offering a sustainable pathway for simultaneous wastewater treatment and clean energy production. Unlike traditional reduction methods that rely on precious metal catalysts and chemical reductants like NaBH4, electrocatalytic 4-NP hydrogenation (4-NPHR) utilizes water as a hydrogen source, which can be driven by electrical energy or renewable electricity.[\[18\]](#page-13-0) Despite its potential, this strategy faces key challenges, including high overpotentials, unwanted side reactions, and the absence of efficient bifunctional catalysts capable of facilitating both anodic (HzOR) and cathodic (4-NPHR) reactions.[\[19\]](#page-13-0) Overcoming these obstacles is crucial for advancing integrated electrochemical systems that unify environmental remediation with sustainable energy generation.

While noble metals like Pt[\[20\]](#page-13-0) Pd,[\[21\]](#page-13-0) Ru,[\[22\]](#page-13-0) Ir,[\[23\]](#page-13-0) and Rh[\[24\]](#page-13-0) exhibit excellent catalytic performance for the HzOR, their high cost, scarcity, and limited stability in alkaline media hinder largescale application.[\[25\]](#page-13-0) To address these challenges, integrating noble metals with transition metals like Fe, Co, Ni, and Mo has emerged as a promising approach.[\[26,27\]](#page-13-0) This combination not only reduces noble metal loading but also introduces synergistic effects that enhance catalytic activity, stability, and electron transfer kinetics.[\[28,29\]](#page-13-0) For instance, Ru, with moderate Ru─H bond strength and near-zero free energy for hydrogen adsorption, is highly active for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).[\[30,31\]](#page-13-0) When combined with transition metals, these hybrid catalysts exhibit optimized electronic structures and improved structural stability, facilitating both HzOR and HER.[\[32\]](#page-13-0) Among transition metals, Fe (same group metal with Ru) is preferred for its abundance, affordability, and versatile electronic structure, although its lower Fe─H bond energy compared to Co or Ni is balanced by strong hydrogen adsorption.[\[33\]](#page-13-0) However, Fe-based catalysts are prone to corrosion and agglomeration under alkaline conditions, limiting electron transport and active site availability.[\[34,35\]](#page-13-0) Bimetallic nanoparticles show superior electrocatalytic activity and durability over monometallic catalysts by synergistically tuning adsorption energies, accelerating charge transfer, and enhancing corrosion resistance, while reducing reliance on precious metals.[\[36\]](#page-13-0) The development of efficient, durable, and costeffective bifunctional electrocatalysts, supported by innovative device engineering, is essential for promoting HzOR and stable H2 production. Given that the noble metal loading is minimal with respect to its transition metal counterpart, noble metal– transition metal composites represent a cost-effective and efficient platform for advancing Hz-assisted water splitting and sustainable hydrogen generation.

Herein, inspired by the above viewpoints, we have developed a green and scalable synthesis strategy for fabricating defectrich Fe–Ru alloy clusters uniformly in situ anchored onto vanadium carbide (Fe─Ru─VC) via ball milling followed by thermal annealing. This Fe─Ru─VC bifunctional electrocatalyst synergistically combines the cost-effectiveness of earth-abundant Fe and the high intrinsic activity of Ru in sub-nanometer alloy clusters, while multiple types of edge-defects (curved, sharp, and zig-zag edges) are introduced into the VC support at sub-nanometer levels, with tunable defect density to optimize catalytic performance. The conductive, defect-rich VC matrix not only provides abundant active sites but also enhances charge transfer and stabilizes the alloy clusters during prolonged operation.

Operating in an alkaline medium (1 M KOH), our catalyst efficiently drives the selective four-electron hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) to N2 and H2O at a significantly reduced anodic overpotential, thus lowering energy input by approximately tenfold compared to conventional water electrolysis, while simultaneously enabling concurrent degradation of hazardous 4 nitrophenol at a reduced cathodic overpotential. Our electrocatalyst demonstrates excellent durability over 90 h of continuous use, and mechanistic insights from in situ Raman spectroscopy and DFT simulations reveal the critical roles of alloying and edgedefects in enhancing catalytic activity, stability, and selectivity. Collectively, the six key advantages of our approach, including, i) scalable synthesis, ii) engineered defect-rich VC support with tunable defect density, iii) synergistic Fe–Ru alloy clusters, iv) enhanced conductivity and stability, v) alkaline selective reaction pathway, and vi) remarkable durability underscore the superior performance and practical potential of our Fe─Ru─VC system

## **2. Results and Discussion**

#### **2.1. Synthesis and Characterization of Fe**─**Ru**─**VC Composites**

**Figure 1**<sup>a</sup> presents the schematic illustration of the synthesis process for the Fe─Ru─VC catalyst. Initially, 200 mg of VC was dispersed in 50 mL of ethanol under magnetic stirring for 60 min, followed by sonication to ensure uniform dispersion. While continuously stirring the VC suspension, precursor solutions of Fe and Ru were added dropwise. To optimize the Fe─Ru to VC weight ratio for enhanced electrochemical performance, 250 mM stock solutions of RuCl3·3H2O (in ethanol) and FeCl3·6H2O (in deionized water) were prepared. The effects of various Fe: Ru mole ratios (4:1, 2:1, and 1:1) were explored by mixing appropriate volumes of these stock solutions. Subsequently, 50 mg of choline chloride was introduced into the mixture as a nitrogen source and structure-directing agent. During the carbonization step, choline chloride decomposes to enable nitrogen doping into the carbon matrix, which enhances electrical conductivity and generates additional catalytically active sites. After 30 min of additional stirring, the mixture was transferred into a stainless-steel jar containing 250 g of ZrO2 balls (0.5 and 1 mm in diameter) and subjected to high-energy ball milling at 500 rpm for 2 h. The

ball milling process ensured uniform mixing of the metal precursors with VC and facilitated the formation of nanoscale interactions among components, promoting homogeneity and active site generation. The obtained product was collected via centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 15 min, thoroughly washed with ethanol and deionized water, and dried at 60 °C. Finally, to improve its conductivity and catalytic activity, the dried Fe─Ru─VC powder was carbonized at 800 °C for 3 h under an argon atmosphere with a heating rate of 5 °C min<sup>−</sup>1. The Ru─VC and Fe─VC samples were synthesized following the same procedure, with either Ru or Fe precursors, respectively. HR-SEM and HR-TEM measurement were employed to investigate the micro (nano) structural and morphological characteristics of VC, Ru─VC, Fe─VC, and Fe─Ru─VC composites. HR-SEM images of VC (Figure [1b\)](#page-2-0) revealed layered surface textures stacked one on the other that resulted in spherical morphology. In Fe─VC (Figure [1c\)](#page-2-0), the Fe particles were evenly distributed on the VC nanosheets. In Ru─VC (Figure [1d\)](#page-2-0), Ru exhibited homogeneous spherical morphology that was uniformly distributed over the VC sheets. The Fe─Ru─VC composite (Figure [1e\)](#page-2-0) demonstrated a uniform distribution of Fe and Ru nanoparticles on the surfaces and edges of VC frameworks, indicative of a cohesive and structurally integrated material. HR-SEM images with different magnifications of VC, Ru─VC, Fe─VC, and Fe─Ru─VC composites are displayed in Figure S1 (Supporting Information). As marked by the yellow guidelines in Figures S1b,d (Supporting Information), Ru─VC and Fe─Ru─VC resembled raspberry and cauliflowerlike, with rough and zig-zag edges. As it is known that kinks and edges are more active,[\[37\]](#page-13-0) we expect such kinks and zig-zag edges in Fe─Ru─VC to play dominant roles in their performance. HR-TEM images of VC revealed interwoven graphitic nanosheets, with an interplanar spacing of 0.97 nm corresponding to the (002) plane of VC (Figure [1f\)](#page-2-0). The magnified HR-TEM images taken at the edges of VC reveal that nanosheet edges are rough and sharp, resembling those of interconnected thorn-like structures (Figure S2a,b, Supporting Information). Sharp edges and zig-zag edges of VC nanosheets can enhance electrolyte accessibility. Whereas, graphitic networks interconnect to form conducting channels, which can accelerate electron mobility and charge transport (Figure S2c, Supporting Information). The HR-TEM image of Fe─VC displays homogeneous encapsulation of Fe nanoparticles within wrinkled VC nanosheets, with a lattice spacing of 0.202 nm attributed to the (200) plane of Fe (Figure [1g;](#page-2-0) Figure S3, Supporting Information). The inter-surface connectivity of Fe nanoparticles encapsulated within VC sheets had improved due to extensive contact of their surfaces with the surfaces of rod-like structures that were peripherally positioned lengthwise. Such unique inter-surface connectivity can enhance electrolyte circulation and improve electronic transport within the built structural frameworks of Fe─VC. The HR-TEM images of Ru─VC confirmed uniform attachment of Ru nanoparticles to the VC nanosheets, with a lattice spacing of 0.236 nm corresponding to the (111) plane of Ru (Figure [1h;](#page-2-0) Figure S4, Supporting Information). Ru nanoparticles had better interconnectivity with rod-like structures that created robust interwoven networks. HR-TEM and SAED patterns validated the presence of Fe and Ru nanoclusters (5–20 nm) on the VC surface (Figure [1i;](#page-2-0) Figure S5, Supporting Information). SAED patterns further confirmed Ru is present in Fe─Ru─VC and is polycrystalline, aligning with XRD results. Elemental mapping confirmed the homogeneous distribution of C, V, O, Fe, Ru, and N within the Fe─Ru─VC framework (Figure [1j\)](#page-2-0). The line scan analysis from the TEM image also confirms the uniform distribution of Fe and Ru (Inset of Figure [1j\)](#page-2-0). EDX spectra further corroborated the presence of Fe and Ru elements, in agreement with high-resolution TEM data (Figure S5, Supporting Information). ICP-OES analysis determined Fe and Ru loadings in Fe─Ru─VC to be 9.20 and 7.34 wt.%, respectively, which is critical for enhancing catalytic activity and stability in energy and environmental applications.

## **2.2. Structural and Surface Chemical Analyses**

XPS was employed to investigate the oxidation states and chemical composition of the catalysts. As illustrated in **Figure 2**[a,](#page-4-0) the XPS spectrum of Fe─Ru─VC reveals six distinct peaks at binding energies of 280, 284, 400, 516, 530, and 714 eV, corresponding to Ru3d, C1s, N1s, V2p, O1s, and Fe2p, respectively. The high-resolution Ru 3d XPS spectrum (Figure [2b\)](#page-4-0) shows two prominent peaks at 280.8 and 284.6 eV, attributed to Ru 3d5/2 and Ru 3d3/2, confirming the presence of metallic Ru° in the Fe─Ru─VC catalyst. The deconvoluted high-resolution C 1s XPS spectrum displays (Figure [2c\)](#page-4-0) six peaks at binding energies of 280.6, 281.8, 284.6, 285.6, 286.5, and 288.6 eV, which are assigned to Ru─O, V─C, C─C, C─N, C─O, and O─C═O groups, respectively. The N1s spectrum reveals four peaks at 398.7, 399.8, 400.8, and 401.7 eV, associated with pyridinic-N, pyrrolic-N, graphitic-N, and oxidized-N, respectively (Figure [2d\)](#page-4-0). The V 2p spectrum shows two primary peaks at 516.5 and 523.4 eV, corresponding to V 2p3/2 and V 2p1/2 (Figure [2e\)](#page-4-0), respectively. The O 1s peak likely arises from physically adsorbed oxygen (Figure S6, Supporting Information). The Fe 2p spectrum indicates the coexistence of Fe0 and Fe2<sup>+</sup>/3<sup>+</sup> oxidation states, with peaks at 706.8, 711.4, and 724.8 eV corresponding to Fe°, Fe 2p3/2, and 2p1/2, respectively (Figure [2f\)](#page-4-0).

XRD analysis was systematically performed to determine the crystalline purity and phase composition of the synthesized materials across different formulations (Figure [2g\)](#page-4-0). XRD pattern of VC revealed five prominent diffraction peaks at 2 values of 37.3, 43.4, 63.2, 75.8, and 79.6° corresponding to the (222), (400), (440), (622), and (444) crystal planes of VC (JCPDS No. 01-089-1096). For Fe-VC, characteristic peaks were observed at 2 values of 44.3, 65.2, and 82.2°, attributed to the (200), (220), and (222) planes of Fe (JCPDS No. 00-002-1237). The XRD pattern of Ru-VC exhibited peaks at 2 values such as 37.4°, 43.5°, 63.3°, and 76.0°, corresponding to the (111), (200), (220), and (311) planes of the Ru with face-centered cubic (fcc) structure (JCPDS No. 01-081-2132). XRD analysis of Fe─Ru─VC (Figure [2g\)](#page-4-0) confirmed the presence of peaks associated with both crystalline Ru and Fe, demonstrating the successful formation of fcc Fe–Ru particles on the VC surface. Notably, the diffraction peaks corresponding to Ru in Fe─Ru─VC were relatively weak, which overlapped with the VC peak, likely due to the low Ru content in the composite.

FTIR spectroscopy analysis was employed to investigate the surface functionalities over the spectral range of 400-4000 cm<sup>−</sup>1, offering insights into their structural and chemical characteristics with all possible interactions. As shown in Figure [2h,](#page-4-0) the FTIR spectrum of VC exhibits distinct vibrational peaks at 3450,

1663, 1382, 988, and 522 cm<sup>−</sup>1, corresponding to O─H, C═O, C═C, V═O, V─C bonds, respectively. These features highlight the diverse functional groups present on the VC surface, which play a pivotal role in modulating its electronic and catalytic properties. In Fe-VC, additional peaks in the 480–630 cm<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> range are observed, attributed to the stretching vibrations of Fe─O bonds within the crystalline Fe lattice. This confirms the successful incorporation of Fe into the VC matrix, which is expected to enhance its catalytic activity by introducing additional active sites and improving charge transfer kinetics. For Ru─VC, the FTIR spectrum shows a characteristic peak at 1119 cm<sup>−</sup>1, indicating the presence of Ru<sup>3</sup><sup>+</sup> species on the VC surface. The reduced band intensities compared to pure VC suggest strong interactions between Ru<sup>3</sup><sup>+</sup> and the VC framework, supporting the effective integration of Ru into the matrix. Such interactions are known to improve the material's catalytic performance by optimizing its electronic structure and enhancing the stability of the active sites. The FTIR spectrum of Fe─Ru─VC reveals peaks corresponding to both Fe and Ru interactions with VC, with red shift in V═O and V–C peaks, corroborating the XRD results discussed above, confirming the formation of the Fe–Ru composite within the VC framework. The combination of electroactive Fe and Ru facilitates synergistic interactions, which are critical for improving the catalytic efficiency and durability of the material under operational conditions.

Raman spectroscopy was employed to elucidate the chemical modifications and defect structures in VC, Ru─VC, Fe─VC, and Fe─Ru─VC, which we believe can provide new insights into their structural dynamics and catalytic sites (Figure 2i). The Raman spectrum of VC exhibited characteristic peaks at 289 and 409 cm<sup>−</sup>1, corresponding to the E1g and A1g vibrational modes, which represent the in-plane and out-of-plane vibrations of

V-atoms, respectively. The peaks at 520 and 684 cm<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> correspond to the in-plane A1g vibrations of the V-atom model in VC and VCO(OH), respectively. The peak at 985 cm<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> is attributed to the V═O stretching vibration, while the peak at 861 cm<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> represents the V─C bond vibrations, suggesting surface oxy-hydroxyl functionalization is a critical factor that enhances the catalytic activity by introducing additional active sites. Comparative Raman analysis (Figure [2i\)](#page-4-0) revealed that Ru─VC, Fe─VC, and Fe─Ru─VC predominantly retained peaks associated with Fe and Ru phases. The Fe─O peak appeared at 723 cm<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> on the VC surface. In the Fe─Ru─VC, the intensity of the Ru–O peaks and peaks corresponding to Ru or Fe on the VC matrix were observed at 741, and 821 cm<sup>−</sup>1, respectively. Importantly, the Fe─Ru─VC composite displayed unique vibrational peaks attributed to the V─N mode, indicating the formation of a VC-N phase at 673 cm<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> due to the use of choline chloride. The Raman spectra highlighted defect structures associated with Fe and Ru atoms anchored at vanadium sites within the Fe─Ru─VC framework. Defect engineering plays a pivotal role in optimizing the electronic structure, enhancing charge transfer kinetics, and improving the material's catalytic efficiency under operational conditions.[\[38\]](#page-13-0) This structural transformation enhances electronic conductivity and catalytic activity, making the material highly suitable for energy conversion, toxic pollutants degradation, and environmental remediation applications. The disruption of V─C bonds and the emergence of Ru and Fe further confirmed the successful intercalation of Ru and Fe into the VC lattice. These strong chemical in-

teractions between the dopant atoms and the vanadium lattice are crucial for stabilizing the active phase, reducing catalyst degradation, and ensuring the uniform distribution of active sites.

#### **2.3. Electrocatalytic Performance of Fe**─**Ru**─**VC**

LSV curves were recorded at a scan rate of 5 mV s<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> with 95% iR compensation. The electrocatalytic performances of Fe-Ru─VC, Ru─VC, Fe─VC, and VC for the HzOR were systematically evaluated in an aqueous electrolyte comprising 1 M KOH and 0.2 M N2H4, using a standard three-electrode setup. The Fe─Ru─VC catalyst achieved a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> at an exceptionally low overpotential of 145 mV, surpassing the performance of Ru─VC and Fe─VC, which required overpotentials of 420 and 476 mV, respectively (**Figure 3**a; Figure S7a, Supporting Information). These results indicate a significant reduction in overpotential for Hz oxidation by replacing the OER with HzOR. The Fe─Ru─VC catalyst demonstrated exceptional electrocatalytic activity for the HzOR, as evidenced by the low Tafel slope value of 68.9 mV dec<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> (Figure 3b; Figure S7b, Supporting Information). The low Tafel slope underscores the catalyst's superior intrinsic electron-transfer kinetics (Figure S7b, Supporting Information). This enhanced activity is attributed to the synergistic effects of Fe and Ru, which improved conductivity and catalytic efficiency, thereby promoting efficient N2 production via HzOR. The Fe─Ru─VC catalyst's outstanding HzOR

performance is further linked to its significantly reduced electrochemical resistance (Figure 3c; Figure S8, Supporting Information). As shown in the equivalent circuit (Figure 3c),  $R_s$ ,  $R_f$ , and  $R_{ct}$  denote the solution resistance, film resistance (linked to the high-frequency semicircle), and charge transfer resistance, respectively. A constant phase element  $(Q_{CPF})$  was used as a circuit element to fit the double-layer capacitance formed at the catalyst/electrode/electrolyte interfaces. EIS results reveal that the Fe—Ru—VC catalyst exhibited the lowest  $R_{ct}$  (Figure S8a, Table S1, Supporting Information), where  $\approx$ 7.5-fold and  $\approx$ 5.2-fold reductions of R<sub>ct</sub> values compared to VC and Fe–VC are attributed to the nanostructured catalyst's enhanced efficient adsorption and oxidation of N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> molecules at the gas-solid-liquid triple-point interface, while the conductive interface created by the functional VC support incorporated with bimetal sites facilitates rapid electron transfer between the resultant nanostructured catalyst surface and the conductive GCE. The Nyquist plots confirmed improved charge transfer kinetics and superior electrical conductivity. The analysis of Bode plots provided insights into the electron lifetime  $(\tau_e)$  from the frequency peak  $(f_{max})$  at a fixed potential of 0.3 V versus RHE (Figure S8b, Supporting Information). The Fe-Ru-VC catalyst exhibited the shortest relaxation time ( $\tau_e = 0.63$  ms), significantly outperforming Fe–VC (19 ms) and Ru-VC (9.77 ms). This indicates faster electron transfer and enhanced HzOR activity for Fe-Ru-VC compared to other catalysts. ECSA, which can be correlated with double-layer capacitance  $(C_{dl})$ , was estimated from CV curves (Figure S9, Supporting Information). The calculated C<sub>dl</sub> values for Fe—Ru—VC, Ru—VC, and Fe-VC were 38, 21, and 19 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>, respectively, indicating that Fe-Ru-VC offers a greater number of accessible electroactive sites (Figures \$9,\$10, Supporting Information). Such key performance metric estimations for Fe-Ru-VC, Ru-VC, and Fe-VC are compared in the spider plot in Figure 3d, confirming that Fe-Ru-VC (1:1) exhibits superior performance compared to the other catalysts.

#### 2.4. Mechanistic Insights into Alkaline HzOR

The Fe-Ru-VC catalyst exhibited optimal HzOR performance by loading 764 µg cm<sup>-2</sup> of suspension, balancing active site availability and charge transfer efficiency in 0.2 M N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> containing 1 M KOH (Figure S11, Supporting Information). Lower (101-764 µg cm<sup>-2</sup>) and higher (≥1273 µg cm<sup>-2</sup>) catalyst loadings led to activity loss due to less availability or aggregation of active sites. To further assess the catalytic performance, the Fe—Ru—VC catalyst was tested under high Hz concentrations. As shown in Figure 3e, increasing Hz concentration (20-200 mM) broadened the potential window and enhanced the current density. The rise in Hz concentration reduced the overpotential required to sustain a given current density, highlighting the catalyst's superior efficiency to effectively catalyze HzOR under high substrate concentrations without any deterioration of active sites. The improved catalytic activity is attributed to the facilitated mass transport of the substrate (Hz) and electrolyte (KOH) at different edges, including curved, zig-zag, and sharp edges as schematized (Figure S2c, Supporting Information). In tandem, the graphitic layers and the nanonetworks helped with the electron transport, which led to high current density. [39] The

long-term stability of the Fe—Ru—VC catalyst was evaluated via chronoamperometry. Over 40 h of continuous HzOR operation at 40 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, the catalyst exhibited minimal performance decay, retaining 91% of its initial current density (Figure 3f). The TOF of HzOR was calculated to be 0.097 s<sup>-1</sup>. Post-stability analyses (Fe—Ru—VC-used) showed no significant changes in phase structure, composition, or morphology, as confirmed by XPS spectra and TEM images (Figures S12,S13, Supporting Information). These findings affirm the excellent durability and structural stability of the Fe—Ru—VC catalyst, making it a promising candidate for sustainable HzOR in advanced electrochemical systems.

#### 2.5. Screening of Catalysts for Hydrogenation of 4-NP

HzOR generates protons, necessitating their effective consumption through a cathodic process to enhance active site utilization and energy efficiency. Using the Fe-Ru-VC catalyst as a hydrogen donor, the hydrogenation of 4-NP to 4-AP was selected as a model reaction. This process involves three sequential twoelectron and two-proton transfer steps, which collectively define the electrocatalytic hydrogenation pathway. We aim to investigate the hierarchical Fe-Ru-VC electrode's efficiency as a cathode for electrocatalytic hydrogenation of 4-NP. The electrocatalytic performance was evaluated in a conventional three-electrode configuration using N<sub>2</sub>-saturated 1 M KOH containing 1 mM 4-NP. LSV measurements were conducted at a scan rate of 5 mV s<sup>-1</sup>, where all steady-state polarization curves were recorded with 95% iR compensation (Figure 4a). The Fe-Ru-VC catalyst demonstrated exceptional activity, attaining higher current densities at 110 mV versus RHE. Control experiments using GCEs without 4-NP revealed a flat anodic wave between 0.40 and -0.2 V versus RHE (Figure 4a). Remarkably, the onset of 4-NP reduction at the Fe-Ru-VC is 215 mV, which is 49, 38, 30, and 20 mV lower than the onset values observed with Fe–VC, Ru–VC, Fe–Ru–VC (4:1), and Fe-Ru-VC (2: 1), respectively. This shows that the Ru to Fe ratio of 1:1 is optimal for achieving the best catalytic activity. The Fe-Ru-VC catalyst with the optimal Ru-Fe ratio (1: 1) demonstrated superior catalytic activity, characterized by rapid H\* desorption and efficient hydrogenation, outperforming other catalysts. These results underscore the superior electrocatalytic efficiency of the Fe—Ru—VC electrode for hydrogenation processes, highlighting its potential to provide a transformative solution to pressing energy and environmental challenges in advanced catalytic systems where the degradation of toxic pollutants with minimum energy input is strategically targeted (Figure 4b). The electrocatalytic activity of Fe-Ru-VC as a function of 4-NP concentrations was evaluated at the scan rate of 5 mV s<sup>-1</sup> as displayed in Figure 4c. We can see that no obvious cathodic current was observed in this potential window without 4-NP. However, with a solution containing 1 mM 4-NP, a significant increment in the cathodic current was observed, which is a typical electrochemical characteristic of 4-NPHR. Furthermore, the current density increases with increasing 4-NP concentration, indicating that the Fe—Ru—VC (1:1) is highly efficient for the catalytic reduction of 4-NP. The linear regression equation from 3.3 to 313.5 nM, characterized by a correlation coefficient of  $R^2 = 0.992$ , is articulated as  $I_{pc} = 10.24c - 0.208$  for Fe–Ru–VC (1:1) (Figure 4c; Figure S14,

Supporting Information) and pc =7.121c−1.059 with <sup>2</sup> =0.994 for Fe─Ru─VC (2:1) (Figure S15, Supporting Information). The exceptional catalytic reduction performance is attributed to i) the efficient anchoring of Fe–Ru species that improved van der Waals interactions with the VC matrix, ii) the VC functions as a strong structural support, inhibiting the clustering of Fe–Ru particles and maintaining a significant level of surface accessibility for the active sites, and iii) well-exposed zig-zag, sharp and curved edges increases exposure of active sites to the electrolyte, enhancing 4-NP transport toward the catalytic interface (Figures S1c,S2c, Supporting Information). The excellent synergy of bimetals (Fe and Ru), coupled with the enhanced electroactive surface area, guarantees excellent sensitivity and efficiency toward the catalytic degradation of 4-NP. We conducted chronoamperometry measurement with 50 mM 4-NP at a fixed potential of 110 mV (vs. RHE). At the start of the 30-minute test, the current was slightly decreased, likely due to 4-NP adsorption on the electrode. The current then remained stable without a notable decrease throughout the measurement (Figure 4d). This shows the good alkaline stability of the Fe─Ru─VC catalyst. Moreover, the degradation of 4-NP in the electrolyte is evident with the color change, where the electrolyte solution is deep yellow prior chronoamperometry measurement (above undivided cell in Figure 4d) and it turned into vivid yellow after 2 h of chronoamperometry measurement (below undivided cell in Figure 4d), revealing excellent catalytic efficiency of our catalyst toward degrading the toxic pollutant, 4- NP. There is still some less intense yellow color seen in the divided cell displayed below, which is likely due to the residual existence of the 4-NP. Thus, it may still need a small extension of electrolysis time for complete color disappearance. Note that 4- NP was degraded at a fixed potential, electrochemically, without any NaBH4 addition. Such reasonably good degradation performance without any support from the reductant (NaBH4) shows that Fe─Ru─VC can be effectively utilized in wastewater treatment. The hydrogenation of 4-NP was marked by a gradual color change from yellow to colorless, achieving ≈100% conversion with a Faradaic efficiency of 96.8% (Figure 4d–f). TOF of 4-NP at 100 mV and current density of 25.33 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> was calculated as 0.0366 s<sup>−</sup>1.

The catalytic performance of the Fe─Ru─VC catalyst was assessed via the reduction of 4-NP using sodium borohydride (NaBH4) by UV–Vis spectroscopy (Figure S16, Supporting

Information). 4-AP in aqueous solution exhibited absorption peaks at 230 and 298 nm. In a 1 M KOH solution, 4-NP shifted from pale yellow to vivid yellow, when the characteristic absorption peak exhibited a notable red shift (81 nm) from 319 to 400 nm in water, which is caused by the formation of nitrophenolate ions in an alkaline environment (pKa of nitrophenolate = ≈7.15 at 25 °C).[\[40,41\]](#page-13-0) Strongly alkaline conditions favored the dissociation of nitrophenolate ions, where their concentration increase in the solution, speeding up the dissociation process. For accurate quantification, calibration curves for 4-NP were constructed (Figure S17, Supporting Information). These findings highlight the excellent electrocatalytic performance of Fe-Ru-VC for 4-NP reduction. HPLC monitoring revealed 49% conversion of 4-NP to 4-AP after 45 min, with 4-AP detected as a potential intermediate (Figure [4f;](#page-7-0) Figure S18, Supporting Information).

Single-cell electrolysis using a divided H-type cell holds great promise for sustainable wastewater treatment applications, where two toxic pollutants can be degraded at the same time, yielding non-toxic chemicals. For instance, we can effectively reduce 4-NP cathodically to 4-AP at low overpotential (100 mV), which is coupled with the anodic reaction involving the conversion of Hz to N2 at a low overpotential (145 mV). The catalytic performance was evaluated using an H-type electrolytic cell with a Nafion 115 proton exchange membrane, where 100 mM 4-NP was added to the catholyte and 200 mM Hz was added to the anolyte (Figure [4g\)](#page-7-0). A single cell was assembled with Fe─Ru─VC serving as the anode for nitrogen production in Hz presence and the Fe─Ru─VC cathode for 4-NP degradation in 4-NP presence and for hydrogen generation in 4-NP absence at a relatively higher overpotential (200 mV) in 1 M KOH. In the paired HzOR and 4-NPHR reactions, LSV achieves a current density plateau of 40 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> at 200 mV (Figure [4h;](#page-7-0) Figure S19, Supporting Information), demonstrating superior energy efficiency and environmental remediation compared to the HER. The chronoamperometric curve indicated stable operation with a cell voltage of 200 mV at 40 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> for 90 h (Video S1, Supporting Information). Fe─Ru─VC, functioning as a bifunctional electrocatalyst, exhibited lower overpotentials for 4-NPHR and HzOR than for HER and OER. Within three hours, 4-NP signals faded, 4-AP signals intensified, and the solution color changed significantly, confirming the complete conversion of 4- NP to 4-AP with 100% faradaic efficiency (Figure S19, Supporting Information). The assembled device was further evaluated in a practical scenario using seawater containing both Hz and 4- NP as the pollutants. When integrated with a solar panel as the power source, the system successfully operated under real-world outdoor conditions and delivered low cell voltage (≈730 mV), demonstrating its potential for real-time environmental remediation and sustainable energy conversion applications (Figure S20, Video S2, Supporting Information). The superior performance of the Fe─Ru─VC catalyst is attributed to its bimetallic structure and VC nanosheet morphology with multiple defects, which optimized intermediate adsorption, enhanced active site availability, and improved electron and charge transport. These features position Fe─Ru─VC as a highly promising material for electrochemical energy and environmental applications.

## **2.6. In Situ Raman Analysis Using the Fe**─**Ru-VC Catalyst to Elucidate the Reaction Pathways of HzOR and 4-NPHR**

In situ Raman analysis was utilized to investigate the real-time structural and compositional changes in the Fe─Ru─VC catalyst under operating conditions (**Figure 5**[a\)](#page-9-0). By analyzing so we will be able to provide valuable insights into the catalytic mechanisms responsible for 4-NPHR and HzOR. A broad vibrational band near 400 cm<sup>−</sup>1, and 704 cm<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> attributed to Ru─Ox bonds, was observed, indicating the formation of RuOx species, a key component for catalytic activity (Figure [5b;](#page-9-0) Figure S21, Supporting Information).[\[42\]](#page-13-0) This transformation is potential-dependent, as evidenced by the emergence of a new peak at 1020 cm<sup>−</sup>1, which corresponds to the Ru–Ox stretching mode (Figure [5b;](#page-9-0) Figure S21, Supporting Information). The peak's intensity increases with higher applied voltages, accompanied by the attenuation of RuOx features, confirming the structural transition from Fe─Ru─VC to Fe-RuOx-VC. In the Raman spectra, the peaks appeared at 526 and 677 cm<sup>−</sup>1, attributed to the vibration mode of FeOOH. The Fe─Ru─VC surface displayed distinct vibrational signatures at 1116 and 1598 cm<sup>−</sup>1, corresponding to the N─H stretching and N─N bending modes of \*NH2NH2 and \*NH2 intermediates, respectively, upon the addition of 10 mM N2H4 to the electrolyte.[\[23,42\]](#page-13-0) These findings suggest the active participation of Hz in stabilizing the catalytic surface by reducing oxidized species (Fe-RuOx-VC) back to active RuOx under reaction conditions. This regeneration mechanism maintains the surface activity and stability of the catalyst, essential for HzOR. Interestingly, at voltages exceeding 0.2 V, the \*NH2 peak intensifies, indicating the accumulation of \*NH2 intermediates and suggesting an alternative HzOR pathway. This reaction pathway involves the adsorption of N2H4 into \*NH2NH2, followed by the cleavage of N─N bonds into \*NH2 groups, which subsequently dehydrogenate to form N2, an environmentally benign byproduct. These results highlight the dual catalytic pathways in HzOR, reflecting the interplay between associative and dissociative mechanisms and underscoring the dynamic adaptability of the Fe─Ru─VC catalyst under varying electrochemical conditions. We also performed EIS analysis by changing potentials in the presence of 10 mM of N2H4. When we applied the potential near the onset of HzOR, the onset of electron transport at the electrode occurred, which was well reflected in the lower resistance values. (Figure [5c,d\)](#page-9-0). The diameter of the semi-circle arc corresponding to the resistance for charge transfer at the electrocatalytic interface decreased significantly from −0.10 to 0.35 V, supporting the improved charge transport as a result of an effective Hz oxidation pathway. A down-shift of phase angle () from 80° to 60° when the potential was increased from −0.1 to 0.35 V indicates the increased Hz oxidation process, which is similar to the phase angle down shift noted for oxygen evolution under alkaline conditions by Wei et al.[\[43\]](#page-13-0)

We also monitored the reduction of 4-NP in real-time using in situ Raman spectroscopy, a valuable tool for studying catalytic mechanisms in electrochemical energy and environmental applications. Electrocatalytic reduction of 10 mM of 4-NP was performed in a custom-designed electrochemical cell, which revealed a distinct reduction peak at 0.15 V versus RHE in LSV on Fe─Ru─VC films, indicating its conversion to 4-AP (Figure [5e\)](#page-9-0).

The worth noting Raman signal intensity drop off and eventual disappearance of Raman peak at 1324 cm<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> (NO2 stretching) with more negative potentials is direct support evidence that the NO2 group in 4-NP is sequentially reduced (Figure S21b, Supporting Information).[\[44\]](#page-13-0) Characteristic peak shifts from 1170 and 1217 cm<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> (O─C) to 1158 (C─H) and 1198 cm<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> confirm the reduction of 4-NP to 4-AP. Raman spectra of 4-NP (Figure 5e) exhibit key peaks at 1100, 1170, 1217, 1283, 1325, and 1530 cm<sup>−</sup>1, linked to C─C ring deformation, C─H bending, O─C stretch, C─H bending, NO2 stretching, and NO2 antisymmetric stretch, respectively.[\[44,45\]](#page-13-0) These results demonstrate the high electrocatalytic and in situ Raman performance of Fe─Ru─VC films, making them a promising dual-functional platform for real-time electrocatalytic process monitoring in energy and environmental applications. EIS data was collected by applying the potentials (Figure 5f,g), the data showed that by moving to less positive potentials (0.40 to 0.15 V) in terms of a gradual switch from the onset potential of 4-NPHR to the peak maxima, the resis-

tance of the electrode was reduced, showing the 4-NP to 4-AP conversion.

#### **2.7. Mechanical Insights from DFT Calculations**

To evaluate the interaction to evaluate the Hz with the VC surface, adsorption energy calculations were performed for two distinct regions: the middle (bulk-like) and the edge. The adsorption energy on the bulk-like region was found to be –0.87 eV, whereas the edge site exhibited a much stronger adsorption energy of –2.29 eV. This significant difference highlights the edge as a highly favorable site for hydrazine adsorption, suggesting that catalytic activity is likely enhanced at the edge, and potentially it is the more active surface (Figure S22, Supporting Information). **Figure [6](#page-10-0)** provides an atomistic insight into the electronic properties and interactions at the Ru–Fe junction, with significant implications for catalysis and electrocatalytic applications.

<span id="page-10-0"></span>**Figure 6.** a) Local electron density represented in terms of energy levels for Fe─Ru and Ru catalysts. b) Density of electronic states as a function of energy levels for the Fe─Ru catalyst. c) Potential profile across the Fe–Ru interface. d) Surface electron density distribution of the Fe─Ru catalyst. e,f) Path 1 and path 2 of the energy levels of transition states for the HZOR on the Fe─Ru catalyst (blue) and Ru catalyst (red). g) Energy levels of transition states for the nitrophenol reduction reaction on the Fe─Ru catalyst (blue) and Ru catalyst (red). h) Steady state changes of intermediate reactants, i) The primary crystal structure of Fe─Ru.

Figure 6a compares the local density of states (LDOS) of pure Ru and the Ru–Fe junction, showing a clear reduction in LDOS at the Ru–Fe interface, particularly in the valence band. This change is attributed to the strong hybridization between Ru and Fe atoms, leading to charge redistribution and localized states that modify the electronic structure.[\[46\]](#page-13-0) The diminished LDOS in the conduction band region, observed for both pure Ru and the Ru–Fe junction, suggests limited electronic activity above the Fermi level. These findings highlight the substantial impact of hybridization on the electronic structure, influencing the material's potential for catalytic applications. As shown in Figure 6a, the electron density in the Fe–Ru and Ru becomes closer as the energy level increases. As a result, it can be predicted that the performance of the Fe–Ru and Ru will be similar at higher energy levels and different at lower energy levels. Further analysis can better explain this phenomenon. The projected Density of States (DOS) data in Figure 6b further support hybridization on the electronic structure. Also, the Ru–Fe junction exhibits a reduced DOS near the Fermi level, reflecting electron density os-

cillations at the interface due to hybridization effects. This reinforces the notion that the Ru–Fe junction's electronic properties are significantly altered compared to pure Ru, with potential consequences for catalysis performance. In fact, fluctuations in electron density and properties near the interface between Fe and Ru could be the main factor in improving the catalytic properties of Fe–Ru compared to Ru.[\[47\]](#page-13-0)

Figure 6c delves into the potential profile across the Fe–Ru interface, showing a pronounced potential drop at the junction's center, which signifies strong electronic interactions and charge redistribution between Fe and Ru. This validates the synergistic effect between Ru and Fe, where the improved electronic effects and charge transport play significant roles in the catalytic mechanisms involved. The symmetric nature of the potential profile indicates a balanced electronic transition between the two materials, while the oscillatory behavior observed in the inset graph suggests localized electronic variations, possibly due to quantum interference or charge density waves. These potential changes are crucial for understanding the charge transport properties of

the Fe-Ru junction and highlighting its significant roles in the underlying catalytic and pollutant degradation pathways in this study. Figure 6d shows the electron density at the catalyst surface and throughout the simulation box. [48] Moreover, Figure 6d highlights the charge transfer effects at the Fe-Ru junction, with Fe attracting electrons from Ru, making Ru more electrondeficient and Fe more electron-rich. This redistribution enhances Ru's catalytic reactivity by making it more susceptible to adsorption and chemical reactions, while Fe stabilizes the system by maintaining higher electron density. This dual role of Ru and Fe enhances the functionality of the junction for catalytic applications, with Ru acting as the reactive site and Fe providing stabilization. Together, these results illustrate how the Ru-Fe junction's electronic structure is altered through hybridization effects. charge redistribution, and localized electronic variations. These modifications are essential for tailoring the material's properties for applications in catalysis and electronic devices, where controlling the electronic environment at the interface is crucial for optimizing performance. The electrocatalytic performances of the Fe-Ru catalyst and the Ru catalyst mediated by the two pathways of Hz oxidation and 4-NP reduction were studied by DFT. The energy levels of the transition states for the Hz oxidation (Figure 6e,f) reactions and 4-NP reduction (Figure 6g) are shown in Figure 6e-i. As is clear from the graphs, the difference in the energy levels between the reactants and products in the 4-NP reduction using Fe—Ru is approximately similar to that of Ru. However, in the HzOR, the overall energy difference as well as the activation energy of the reaction on the Fe-Ru catalyst is lower than that of Ru. Figure 6e,f demonstrates that the Fe-Ru catalyst enhances HzOR by lowering the activation energy and increasing the reaction rate. This difference and improvement in catalytic effect can be related to the difference in electronic properties, especially at the Ru: Fe interface, which was mentioned in the previous analyses.

## 3. Conclusion

This work introduces a scalable and effective strategy for fabricating defect-rich Fe-Ru alloy clusters anchored on VC using ball milling and thermal annealing. The resulting Fe-Ru-VC catalyst demonstrates excellent bifunctional electrocatalytic performance for both the HzOR and 4-NPHR, two critical reactions for energy-efficient nitrogen production and pollutant degradation. Specifically, the catalyst exhibited a low overpotential of 145 mV at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> and a Tafel slope of 68.9 mV dec<sup>-1</sup> for HzOR, maintaining stable activity over 90 h. For 4-NPHR (1 mM), it achieved an overpotential of 100 mV at -7.2 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, highlighting its high efficiency in environmental remediation. In a dualfunction H-cell setup (HzOR | 4-NPHR), the Fe-Ru-VC catalyst required only 200 mV to reach 40 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, underlining its exceptional energy-saving capability. The superior catalytic performance is attributed to the synergistic interaction between Fe and Ru, the prevention of nanoparticle agglomeration, high surface area, exposed edge defects, and the enhanced electronic conductivity. In situ Raman analysis confirmed the dynamic formation of Fe—Ru(OOH) active species is primarily responsible for the efficient 4-NP degradation. Experimental results were further supported by DFT calculations, which revealed that the Ru-Fe junction, and that too specifically, the edge sites compared to the bulklike region, exhibits enhanced electronic interactions and favorable adsorption characteristics, consistent with the observed catalytic behavior. These findings establish Fe—Ru—VC as a promising multifunctional catalyst for sustainable energy applications and wastewater treatment, offering a practical path toward integrated sustainable electrochemical systems for environmental and energy technologies.

## 4. Experimental Section

Chemicals: p-Nitrophenol (p-NP, 4-NP, 98%), p-aminophenol (p-AP, 98%), nitric acid (HNO $_3$ , 65–68%), potassium hydroxide (≥93%, KOH extra pure flakes), iron(III) chloride hexahydrate (FeCl $_3$ ·6H $_2$ O), hydrazine hydrate (>98%, N $_2$ H $_4$ ·H $_2$ O), Nafion perfluorinated resin solution (5 wt.%), ruthenium chloride trihydrate (RuCl $_3$ ·3H $_2$ O, ≥98%), sodium borohydride (NaBH $_4$ , ≥98%), and choline chloride (≥98%) were procured from Aldrich Chemical Co. (Shanghai, China). Vanadium carbide powder (VC, 99.5%, <2 µm) and nickel foam (NF, purity > 99.9) were sourced from MTI Corporation Co., Ltd. The NF featured a thickness of 0.2 mm and a surface density of 346 g m $^{-2}$ .

Characterizations: Nanostructure features and morphologies of Fe-Ru-VC were examined using a high-resolution scanning electron microscope (HR-SEM, Hitachi SU-8010) operated at 15 kV and an HR-TEM (JEOL JEM-2100F) operated at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. Selective area electron diffraction (SAED) with a 40 µm aperture and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) were used for elemental distribution and metal composition analyses. The crystalline phases of Fe-Ru-VC were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectroscopy using a PANalytical X'Pert Pro MRD instrument equipped with a Cu K $\alpha$ source ( $\lambda = 1.5406$  Å). The analysis employed a scan rate of 5 min<sup>-1</sup> over a diffraction angle ( $\theta$ ) in the range of 5°-80°. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was conducted with a Thermo Kalpha spectrometer to determine the oxidation state and elemental composition of Fe-Ru-VC. An Al K $\alpha$  (1486.6 eV) X-ray served as the excitation source, with ion source energy ranging from 100 V to 3 kV with a spot size of 3-4 μm. XPS spectra were calibrated to the standard C 1s peak at 284.6 eV. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) of the synthesized Fe-Ru-VC catalysts was performed using a JASCO FT/IR 6600 spectrometer, with spectra acquired after 600 scans in the range of  $4000-400 \text{ cm}^{-1}$  at a resolution of  $4 \text{ cm}^{-1}$ . In situ Raman spectroscopic analysis was carried out using a NOST Co. Ltd. (FEX) spectrometer equipped with a 20x microscope objective and a 532 nm excitation laser. Raman spectra were collected with an exposure time of 20 s, and each spectrum was averaged over 15 exposures. The Ru and Fe contents in the electrocatalysts were quantified using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES; Optima 7300 DV, PerkinElmer, USA). The catalytic activity of Fe-Ru-VC was evaluated by monitoring the reduction of 4-NP at a constant temperature of 25 °C using a UV-vis spectrophotometer (JASCO V-770) and 1 cm quartz cell over a wavelength range of 200-800 nm.

Electrochemical Measurements: The electrocatalytic performance of the Fe-Ru-VC was evaluated using an IviumSoft electrochemical workstation with a standard three-electrode configuration at 25 °C. The setup included a Fe—Ru—VC-modified glassy carbon electrode (GCE, diameter: 5 mm, geometric surface area: 0.196 cm<sup>2</sup>) as the working electrode, a Hg/HgO (1 M KOH) reference electrode, and a platinum wire and/or graphite auxiliary electrode as needed for the cell assembly (undivided or divided configurations). All potentials in the study were converted to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and corrected for 95% iR compensation. All potentials measured against the Hg/HgO reference electrode were converted to the RHE scale using the formula:  $E(_{calculated \ vs \ RHE}) = E$  $(_{\rm measured\ vs\ Hg/HgO}) + E^{\circ}_{\rm\ (Hg/HgO)} + 0.059 \times {\rm pH}, \ {\rm where}\ E^{\circ}_{\rm\ (Hg/HgO)} \ {\rm is\ con}$ sidered as 0.098 V versus RHE and the pH of the electrolyte (1 M KOH) used is determined to be 14. Homogeneous catalyst ink of Fe-Ru-VC was prepared by ultrasonically dispersing 5 mg of catalyst in 0.39 mL isopropyl alcohol, 0.6 mL deionized water (18.2 M $\Omega$  cm), and 10  $\mu$ L Nafion (5 wt.%). Aliquots of 15  $\mu L$  of the ink were pipetted onto pre-cleaned GCE and

allowed to dry at room temperature. Homogeneous inks of electrocatalysts (controls) were prepared using the same protocol as that for Fe-Ru-VC. LSV curves were recorded at a scan rate of 5 mV s<sup>-1</sup> in 1 M KOH electrolyte with 95% iR compensation unless specified otherwise. For stability tests, a 1 cm × 1 cm NF electrode was used as the working electrode, with the catalyst uniformly sprayed onto its surface at an optimal catalyst loading of 2 mg cm<sup>-2</sup>. Prior use of the nickel foam, it was sequentially cleaned via ultrasonication in 0.1 M HNO<sub>3</sub>, ethanol, and deionized water for 15 min in each solution, followed by drying in an oven at 60 °C. This process ensured the effective removal of surface oxides and other contaminants and improved hydrophilicity. Long-term stability of the electrocatalysts was assessed using chronoamperometric measurements, maintaining a fixed current density of 50 mA  $\,\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$  while monitoring potential changes over 90 h in both three and two-electrode configurations. Charge transfer characteristics of the Fe-Ru-VC-modified GCE were analyzed using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in a 1 M KOH electrolyte. The EIS measurements were conducted with an AC amplitude of 10 mV over a frequency range of 0.1 to 10<sup>5</sup> Hz at various potentials (vs. RHE). The analysis of Bode plots provided insights into the electron lifetime  $(\tau_e)$  from the frequency peak  $(f_{max})$  at a fixed potential, which was calculated using the relation  $\tau_{\rm e}=1/(2\pi f_{\rm max})$ . Tafel slopes were calculated using the equation:  $\eta = b \log j + c$ , where  $\eta$  is the overpotential, j is the current density, b is the Tafel slope, and c is the interception. Overpotential ( $\eta$ ) was determined using the formula:  $\eta = E$  (vs. RHE) - 1.23 V (thermodynamic potential).

Calculation of the Electrochemical Surface Area: The double-layer capacitance  $(C_{dl})$  of the electrocatalyst surface was utilized to determine the ECSAs of all samples. The non-Faradic region related to double-layer charging and the sweep rate dependence of CV was utilized to determine C<sub>dl</sub>, which ranges from 1.15 to 1.35 V versus RHE. The CV scans were conducted at various sweep rates, from 10 to 100, with 10 mV s<sup>-1</sup> increments per sweep. The C<sub>dl</sub> was calculated as the slope derived from the linear fitting of current and sweep rate at a constant overpotential of 21 mV (vs. RHE), with the current  $(\Delta i/2 = (i_a - i_c)/2)$  acquired from the CV curves being directly proportional to the sweep rate. The EC-SAs of the electrocatalysts were determined from the C<sub>dl</sub> using the formula: ECSA =  $C_{dl}/C_s$ , where  $C_s$  is 0.022 mF cm<sup>-2</sup> in 1 M KOH.<sup>[49]</sup> The electrolytes were pre-purged with oxygen gas for at least 20 min before HzOR measurements.<sup>[50]</sup> The turnover frequency (TOF) of the HzOR and 4-NOHR was calculated by TOF =  $I/nF\Gamma A$ . In which the I is the measured steady-state current (mA cm<sup>-2</sup>), n is the number of electrons transferred per molecule (n = 4 for HzOR: and n = 6 for 4-NP), F is Faraday's constant (96 485 C mol<sup>-1</sup>),  $\Gamma$  is surface site density (mole cm<sup>-1</sup>),  $(1.2 \times 10^{-6} \text{ mol cm}^{-2} \text{ based on ICP data})$ , and A is the electrode surface area (cm<sup>2</sup>).

DFT Calculations: DFT calculations were performed using QuantumATK to investigate the adsorption energies of Hz and 4-NP on Ru (001) and Ru (001)/Fe (111) junctions. The Ru (001) surface was modeled as a four-layer slab, with the two bottom layers constrained to represent bulk properties and the top two layers relaxed to simulate the surface. A vacuum region of 10 Å was added along the y-axis to prevent interactions between periodic images. The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof exchange-correlation functional was employed, along with Grimme's DFT-D3 dispersion corrections to account for van der Waals interactions. The basis set used was double-zeta polarized (DZP) with norm-conserving pseudopotentials, and the density mesh cutoff was set to 80 Hartree for improved accuracy. A Monkhorst-Pack k-point grid of  $6 \times 1 \times 4$  was used for Brillouin zone sampling, and the relaxation criteria included a force tolerance of 0.04 eV  $\rm \mathring{A}^{(-1)}$  and a stress tolerance of 0.01 GPa. The surface energy ( $\gamma$ ) of Ru (001) was calculated using the formula:

$$\gamma = E_{slab} - N \times E_{bulk} \tag{1}$$

where  $E_{slab}$  is the total energy of the slab,  $E_{bulk}$  is the energy per atom in the bulk structure, N is the number of bulk-equivalent atomic layers in the slab. To study the Ru (001)/Fe (111) junction, Ru (001) was interfaced with Fe (111), ensuring that the Ru surface was prepared as described above

while the Fe layers were optimized. For the junction, a k-point grid of 5  $\times$  1  $\times$  2 was used with identical computational settings, including the density mesh cutoff, dispersion corrections, and relaxation criteria. Adsorption energies ( $E_{ads}$ ) of Hz and 4-NP were calculated on both Ru (001) and Ru (001)/Fe (111) surfaces using the formula:

$$E_{ads} = E_{total} - (E_{slab} + E_{molecule}) \tag{2}$$

where  $E_{total}$  is the total energy of the slab with the adsorbed molecule,  $E_{slab}$  is the energy of the clean slab, and  $E_{molecule}$  is the energy of the isolated molecule in the gas phase. The energies of isolated Hz and 4-NP molecules were calculated with a force tolerance of 0.001 eV Å<sup>(-1)</sup> and a stress tolerance of 0.01 *GPa* to ensure high accuracy.

In addition to Ru-based surfaces, adsorption studies were also carried out on VC. Two types of VC regions were considered: the middle (bulk-like) and the edge. For simulating reactions in the middle region, a VC slab was modeled using a  $7 \times 1 \times 3$  mesh with a vacuum along the y-axis to eliminate inter-slab interactions. For edge region simulations, a  $7 \times 1 \times 1$  mesh was employed, with vacuum regions added along both the y- and z-axes. The surface energy was calculated by treating the top two layers as the surface and the remaining layers as bulk. Adsorption energies for Hz on VC were also calculated for both the middle and edge regions. All calculations were performed with energy convergence criteria set to  $10^{-5}$  eV. The adsorption geometries, interaction energies, and their implications for catalytic behavior were systematically analyzed to provide insights into the role of Ru and Ru-Fe junctions in reactions involving Hz and 4-NP, as well as the role of VC (middle and edge regions) in reactions involving hydrazine. DFT calculations revealed that these defects facilitate charge delocalization, effectively lowering the catalyst's electrical resistance and reducing the overpotential for hydrazine oxidation (HzOR).

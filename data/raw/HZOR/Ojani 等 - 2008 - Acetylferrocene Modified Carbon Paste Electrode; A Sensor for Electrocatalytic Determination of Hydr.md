#### Abstract

The electrocatalytic oxidation of hydrazine at a carbon paste electrode spiked with acetylferrocene as a mediator was studied by cyclic voltammetry, differential pulse voltammetry, and chronoamperometry. In contrast to other ferrocenic compounds, acetylferrocene exhibits a chemical irreversible behavior, but it can act as an effective mediator for electrocatalytic oxidation of hydrazine, too. The heterogeneous electron transfer rate constant between acetylferrocene and the electrode substrate (carbon paste) and the diffusion coefficient of spiked acetylferrocene in silicon oil were estimated to be about  $3.45 \times 10^{-4}$  cm s<sup>-1</sup> and  $4.45 \times 10^{-9}$  cm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. It has been found that under the optimum conditions (pH 7.5) the oxidation of hydrazine occurs at a potential of about 228 mV less positive than that of an unmodified carbon paste electrode. The catalytic oxidation peak current of hydrazine was linearly dependent on its concentration and the obtained linear range was  $3.09 \times 10^{-5}$  M  $-1.03 \times 10^{-3}$  M. The detection limit (2 $\sigma$ ) has been determined as  $2.7 \times 10^{-5}$  M by cyclic voltammetry. Also, the peak current was increased linearly with the concentration of hydrazine in the range of  $1 \times 10^{-5}$  M  $-1 \times 10^{-3}$  M by differential pulse voltammetry with a detection limit of  $1 \times 10^{-5}$  M. This catalytic oxidation of hydrazine has been applied as a selective, simple, and precise new method for the determination of hydrazine in water samples.

Hydrazine is a small, difunctional and reactive molecule with good reducing capabilities and can enter into diverse reactions in numerous applications. Hydrazine is used for water treatment, agriculture, pharmaceuticals chemical blowing agents and a wide variety of other applications. The electroanalytical techniques have been shown to provide a selective and sensitive approach, based on electrooxidation of hydrazine. The direct oxidation of hydrazine at bare electrode is not suited for analytical application due to slow electrode kinetics and high overpotentials required for redox reactions of hydrazine on many electrodes. For this reason, redox mediators have been widely used in order to decrease the overpotential and increasing the electron transfer kinetics. Different electron transfer mediators such as, metal phthalocyanine [1, 2], tetra-aza-annulenes [1], cobaltpentacyanonitrosyl ferrate [3] have been used for determination of hydrazine.

Although metals such as Pt, Au and Ag are very active in anodic oxidation of hydrazine. They are too expensive for practical applications. The construction of electrode by incorporating an electroactive substances into a carbon paste matrix until now for the determination of trace amounts of some substances [4,5], as electrochemical sensor for the analysis of biologically important compounds [6] and for electrocatalysis [7, 8] has been reported. Some advantages of carbon paste electrode (CPE) over all other solid electrodes are the ease and fast preparation and of obtaining

a new reproducible surface, the low residual current, porous surface and low cost of carbon paste.

On the other hand, previously we have reported the suitability of ferrocene and some ferrocene derivatives for the mediated oxidation and determination of some important analytes such as ascorbic acid, sulfite, cysteine [7-12]. According to our knowledge, there is not any report on the suitability of the ferrocene or ferrocene derivatives for the mediated oxidation of hydrazine. Also, all ferrocene and ferrocene derivatives that were previously used for electrocatalysis purposes has exhibited chemical reversibility together with the electrochemical reversibility in the absence of substrate. But in the present work, in spite of the fact that the acetylferrocene modified carbon paste electrode (AFMCPE) does not exhibit a chemical reversibility in the absence of substrate at the experimental condition for electrocatalysis, we will report for the first time the electrocatalytic properties for acetylferrocene (as mediator with chemical irreversible behavior) modified carbon paste electrode toward the electrocatalytic oxidation of hydrazine using various electroanalytical procedures (Scheme 1).

Figure 1A shows the cyclic voltammograms of AFMCPE at the various scan rates. The voltammograms obtained for the acetylferrocene modified electrode revealed that only a single anodic wave in a low scan rate can be observed; hence, the oxidation of acetylferrocene appeared to be irreversible

over the potential range studied. But in a higher potential scan rate, reverse peak was slowly increased. These observations are completely different with respect to electrochemical behavior of ferrocene or some other its derivatives having reversible behaviors. Results show the existence of a coupled follow up chemical reaction with the acetylferrocene electrooxidation, resulting chemical irreversibility for it and no electrochemical irreversibility. However, for the determination of hydrazine involving mediated processes, anodic response is more important than the cathodic response because the magnitude of the former current is expected to increase during electrocatalysis, bearing this in mind the behavior of the oxidation waves was investigated during the reminder of this study [13, 14]. We propose two proofs for it. The first point is autooxidation (between ferricinium and acetyl group) of this ferrocene derivative because of former observations. Also some articles are spoken about polymerization of this compound [15, 16]. Finally, cyclic voltammograms were used to examine the variation of peak current versus the potential scan rates. The plot of anodic currents against the scan rates (Fig. 1B) shows that the  $I_{pa}$  values were linear with  $v^{1/2}$ , and indicate that the reaction is diffusion controlled.

One of the methods to calculate the heterogeneous electron transfer rate constant was given by Nicholson [17]. This method was based on cyclic voltammetry procedure and potential difference between peaks ( $\Delta E_{\rm p}$ ). They presented a working curve that n  $\Delta E_{\rm p}$  vs.  $\Psi$  was defined. Also  $\Psi$  was as follow:

$$F = k^0 (RT)^{1/2} / (nFD\pi v)^{1/2}$$

From this working curve for a scan rate of 200 mV s<sup>-1</sup> the value of  $\Psi$  can be calculated as 0.350. By diffusion coefficient of acetylferrocene in silicon oil determining by chronoamperometry ( $D_{\rm app} = 4.45 \times 10^{-9} \, {\rm cm}^2 \, {\rm s}^{-1}$ ) and related equation, the  $k^0$  value was calculated as  $3.45 \times 10^{-4} \, {\rm cm} \, {\rm s}^{-1}$ .

The electrochemical behavior of hydrazine is dependent on the pH value of aqueous solutions. We studied the electrochemical behavior of hydrazine in buffered solutions with different pH values  $(5 \le pH \le 9)$  at the surface of AFMCPE by cyclic voltammetry. Cyclic voltammograms obtained with AFMCPE for solutions containing hydrazine in strongly acidic media (e.g.,  $pH \le 3$ ) showed that hydrazine did not couple catalytically with the acetylferrocene. Variation in electrolyte pH shows variations in the formal potential of hydrazine. Consequently, the thermodynamic driving force for the catalysis will vary with pH, making the different peak currents of cyclic voltammograms at the different pH values. The pH 7.5 was chosen as optimum pH for the electrocatalysis of hydrazine at the surface of the AFMCPE because the anodic peak current in this pH is larger than another pH values.

carbon paste electrode (curve b) in the presence of 1 mM hydrazine at the same pH, demonstrates that electrooxidation of hydrazine can be catalyzed by acetylferrocene as a mediator. This catalytic process, according to EC' catalytic mechanism can be expressed as follow:

$$CpFeCp \rightleftharpoons CpFe^+CP + e^-E$$

$$4CpFe^+Cp + N_2H_4 \rightarrow N_2 + 4H^+ + 4CpFeCp C$$

The results show that oxidation of hydrazine at the surface of AFMCPE occurs at a potential about 228 mV less positive than at the bare carbon paste electrode. The electrocatalytic peak current of hydrazine at the surface of AFMCPE was linearly dependent on the hydrazine concentration and the range of this linearity depends on the amount of mediator in the electrode. The mediated oxidation peak current of hydrazine at the surface of 1% Acetylferrocene modified carbon paste electrode was proportional to the concentration of substrate within the range of  $3.09 \times 10^{-5} - 1.03 \times 10^{-3}$  M with a correlation coefficient of 0.998 (n = 9) (Fig. 3A). The detection limit  $(2\sigma)$  was  $2.7 \times 10^{-5}$  M (Fig. 3B).

Also, the catalytic oxidation of hydrazine by AFMCPE was studied by chronoamperometry. These method measurements in the absence and presence of different hydrazine concentrations are depicted in Figure 4A. Chronoamperograms show an increase in hydrazine concentration accompanied by increasing in anodic currents obtained when the potential step (0.8 V) is applied. Therefore, the results

B) Cottrell curve for AFMCPE from the chronoamprogram of part (A).

obtained show that the oxidation of hydrazine can be catalyzed by the mediator at the surface of the AFMCPE. Diffusion coefficient can be obtained by using of electrochemical data based on the curve from Figure 4A and Cottrell's law:

$$I = nFAD^{1/2} \pi^{-1/2} t^{-1/2} C$$

Where D (cm² s<sup>-1</sup>) is the diffusion coefficient of spiked acetylferrocene in silicon oil and C (mol cm<sup>-3</sup>) is the concentration of acetylferrocene dissolved in silicon oil. A is the geometric area of acetylferrocene modified carbon paste electrode and was calculated according to  $(\pi(d/2)^2)$ . The D value for acetylferrocene was calculated from the slope of the I vs.  $t^{-1/2}$  plot (Fig. 4B) using n=1, F=96485 c mol<sup>-1</sup>,  $A_g=0.07$  cm² and the corresponding C value (0.146 M), and was found to be  $4.45 \times 10^{-9}$  cm² s<sup>-1</sup>.

Subsequently, the determination of hydrazine concentration at the surface of AFMCPE was performed with DPV (Fig. 5A). The oxidation peak currents of hydrazine were measured in optimum conditions and plotted against the bulk concentration of hydrazine (Fig. 5B). The dependence of peak currents on the concentration of hydrazine is a linear relationship in the range of  $1 \times 10^{-5} - 1 \times 10^{-3}$  M. The linear regression equation is expressed as  $I_p$  ( $\mu$ A) = 26.66 C (mM) + 51.94. The detection limit ( $2\sigma$ ) is  $1 \times 10^{-5}$ . In order to test the reliability of prepared modified electrode, it was applied to determine hydrazine in water sample. It was made by the standard addition procedure, because of unknown matrix of sample. These results are shown in

Table 1. Results of recoveries are close to 100%, indicating that there are no interferences in it. Also relative standard deviation is reported in Table 1 and accuracy was examined by comparison of data obtained from this method with standard method (Spectrophotometer method) [18]. The results from statistical calculations indicate good agreement between mean values (t-test) and precision (F-test) for two methods (p ¼ 0.05). Finally proposed method is a simple, selective and inexpensive technique for determination of hydrazine in water samples and gave satisfactory results.

# Experimental

The solvent used for the electrochemical studies was twice distilled water. Potassium Chloride from Fluka was used as the supporting electrolyte. Acetylferrocene and hydrazine monohydrochloride were from Fluka and were used without further purification. Buffer solutions were prepared from ortho phosphoric acid and its salts in the pH range (5 – 9). Silicon oil, from Fluka was used as the pasting liquid for the carbon paste electrode. A 1% (w/w) acetylferrocence spiked carbon powder was made by dissolving the given quantity of acetylferrocene in diethylether and hand mixing with 100 times its weight of graphite powder with a mortar and pestle. The solvent was evaporated by stirring.

A 1 :1 (w/w) mixture of 0.99% acetylferrocene and carbon powder and silicon oil was blended by hand-mixing and resulting paste was then inserted in the bottom of a polypropylene tube. A carbon paste electrode without acetylferrocene was used as blank to determine background current.

The electrochemical experiments were carried out using a potentiostat/galvanostat (BHP 2061- C Electrochemical Analysis system, Behpajooh, Iran) coupled with a Pentium II personal computer connected to HP laser jet 6L printer, and experiments were preformed in a three-compartment glass cell one for each of the electrode :the working electrode, acetylferrocene modified carbon paste electrode (A ¼ 0.07 cm<sup>2</sup> ), the reference electrode, saturated Ag j AgCl, to which all the potential are quoted, and the counter electrode, a Pt coil, also a pH meter (Ion Analyzer 250, Corning) was to read the pH of the buffered solutions.

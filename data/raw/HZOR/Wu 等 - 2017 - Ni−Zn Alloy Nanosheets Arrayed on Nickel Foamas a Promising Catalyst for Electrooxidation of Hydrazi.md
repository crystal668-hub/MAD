**Abstract:** The development of cost-effective electrocatalyst is a key issue in promoting the practical application of hydrazine as a viable energy carrier. Herein, a nickel foam-supported Ni–Zn alloy catalyst is synthesized by the electrodeposition and anodic dissolution methods. The developed catalyst with an open nanowall network structure and robust adhesion exhibits high activity and good durability for [electrooxidation of hydrazine](http://jes.ecsdl.org/content/162/14/F1415.short) in alkaline medium. For example, a current density of 300 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> at 0.40 V and an onset potential of –0.15 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode are achieved in a 0.10 M hydrazine and 1.0 M NaOH solution at 30 °C. The phase and structure analysis by XRD, SEM, and XPS is conducted to gain insight into the excellent catalytic performance of the Ni–Zn alloy catalyst. Such understanding is of important directive significance to design efficient non-precious catalysts.

#### **1. Introduction**

Hydrogen is a clean, renewable and highly efficient energy carrier that ensures a secure and sustainable energy future, but commercial application of hydrogen-powered fuel cell is severely impeded by the lack of efficient means for production, storage and transportation of hydrogen.[1–5] In this context, considerable efforts have been directed to hydrogen-rich chemical hydrides as potential liquid fuels, including methanol, sodium borohydride, formic acid, and hydrazine (N2H4).[6] Among the chemical hydrides of interest, hydrazine is an attractive fuel candidate because of its low cost, abundance and relatively simple synthesis.[6–10] Although hydrazine is poisonous and probably even mutagenic, its solid polymers with carbonyl or amide groups can be safely stored.[9] Hydrazine can be released on addition of the solvents when required, and the polymer can be reused. Direct hydrazine fuel cells (DHFCs) possess many advantages, such as high theoretical cell voltage of 1.56 V, high power density (5.4 KWh L<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> ), moderate operation temperatures, and no greenhouse gas emission.

development of the DHFC was led by the Daihatsu Motor Co. Ltd. in the 1970s as an alternative means of vehicle propulsion. [10] The electrochemical reactions in a DHFC employing oxygen as oxidant in alkaline medium can be represented by the Eqs. (1)–(3). The performances of DHFCs greatly depend on the electrocatalysts. Noble metals, such as Pt, Pd, Ag and Au,[11–18] exhibit excellent catalytic activity towards hydrazine oxidation. However, high cost of noble metals and the problem of fuel crossover in acidic environment have hindered the commercial application for DHFCs.[19] Over the past decades, it was recommended that anion exchange polymer membrane can be used in place of proton exchange membrane in DHFCs.[6–11,20,21] In alkaline environment, the electrode reaction kinetics has been observed to be higher than those in acid medium, and non-noble metal catalysts in such medium exhibit better stability.[9,19–22] Up to date, a number of non-noble metals and their alloy[s for](http://jes.ecsdl.org/content/162/14/F1415.short)  [hydrazine oxidation](http://jes.ecsdl.org/content/162/14/F1415.short) have been investigated, including Co, [9,21–23] Cu,[24–26] Ni [9,21,22,27] and binary and/or ternary Ni-based metal catalysts (Ni–M, M = Co, Cu, Fe, Zn, B and S).[28–35] Among these catalysts reported, the performance of Ni–Zn alloy due to alloying effects stands out as the top level of anode catalysts in DHFCs.[31–33] As exemplified, Daihatsu Motor Co. Ltd. displayed successfully a hydrazine hydrate fueled electric vehicle using this Ni–Zn alloy as an anode catalyst on the Tokyo Motor Show in 2013.[32] However, these electro-catalysts are in the form of powder, which are prepared by the spray pyrolysis, high-energy ball-mill, and impregnation procedures.[31–33] For the powdery materials, a conductive agent and a polymer binder are commonly used during the preparation of electrodes, which not only increases contact resistance of the electrodes but also inevitably reduces the performance of fuel cells.[36] Recently, the binder-free electrode was widely adopted to address this problem.[23–27,34]

In the present study, Ni foam was selected as a support material and current collector for its porous structure, low density, good electrical conductivity, and high thermal/chemical stability under alkaline medium. Importantly, Ni foam itself exhibits a moderate activity for hydrazine oxidation. Herein, a Ni–Zn alloy nanosheets arrayed on three-dimensional Ni foam (denoted as the Ni–Zn/Ni foam) was prepared using an electrodeposition process, and followed by anodic dissolution of Zn from the deposited alloy. Remarkably, the as-prepared Ni–Zn alloy catalyst with an open nanowall network structure and robust adhesion manifests excellent activity and good cycling stability for oxidation of hydrazine, making it a promising anode electrocatalyst for DHFCs.

#### **2. Results and Discussion**

The Ni foam-supported Ni–Zn alloy catalyst was prepared by a two-step electrochemical procedure, that is, electrodeposition of Ni–Zn alloy from a modified Watts type bath, followed by electrochemical leaching of Zn from the alloy. Figure 1a shows the

**Figure 1.** (a) Cyclic voltammetry (CV) profiles of as-deposited Ni–Zn/Ni foam precursor during electrochemical dealloying in a 1.0 M NaOH solution at 30 °C from – 0.3 to + 0.6 V at a scanning rate of 40 mV s–1; (b) Compositional change of the as-plated Ni–Zn alloy film during electrochemical dissolution.

voltammetric characteristics during the electrochemical dissolution of dealloying process. The first cycle shows that Zn dissolution peaks appeared at 0.16 V and stretched to 0.34 V. With the cycle number increasing, the Zn dissolution peaks decreases further in intensity, and becomes gradually a single peak. After 200 cycles, the peak current has dropped to nearly zero, indicating that the dissolution of Zn is absent resulting in a stable Ni-like CV profile. The compositional change of the Ni–Zn alloy during electrochemical dissolution was monitored by ICP-AES analysis, as shown in Figure 1b. After 10 and 200 cycles, the Ni content of the alloy increases from initial 55.62 mol% to around 82.65 and 85.48 mol% of Ni, respectively. The result suggests that Zn is not completely leached from the bulk alloy but dissolved preferentially from the surface sites such terraces or steps, [37] and Ni atoms should accumulate on the surface and locally block further dissolution. The harvested catalyst is a Nirich Ni–Zn alloy (as stated below). One possible reason is that a passive Ni-rich layer during the dissolution process is formed on the surface.[38] This passive layer of Ni is formed due to the strong interaction between the OH– and the Ni2+ ions which are exposed after removal of Zn from the surface. This layer may prevent further penetration of OH– ions into the bulk of the alloy.

The crystal structures of the catalyst samples were characterized by XRD analyses. As shown in Figure 2, three strong diffraction peaks in the deposited Ni film sample can be observed with 2*θ* values of 44.70, 52.05, and 76.57°, corresponding to (111), (200), and (220) planes of fcc Ni (PDF no. 01-070-0989), respectively. In the Ni–Zn alloy samples before and after electrochemical leaching, however, all the characteristic peaks of metallic Ni are observed to slight shift towards a lower angle, indicating to formation of a Ni–Zn alloy.

Based on the Ni–Zn alloy phase diagram,[39] this alloy is a Ni-rich α-NiZn (~0–27 mol% Zn) or Zn-rich β-NiZn (~50 mol% Zn) phase, and is formed by the substitution of smaller Ni atoms with larger Zn atoms while retaining the Ni fcc crystal structure, resulting in a negative shift of characteristic peaks of Ni. In addition, the minimal traces of ZnO and NiO as well as the Ni– Zn alloy phases (JCPDS No. 03-065-2880 and 01-075-0197) were also detected in as-deposited Ni–Zn/Ni foam sample, but the β-NiZn alloy phase almost disappeared after the electrochemical leaching of Zn. This result indicates that the dealloying occurs a transformation from (α+β)- to α-NiZn alloy phase. In comparsion with the Ni film, the Ni–Zn alloy film samples present weak and wide peaks of Ni. According to the Scherrer equation, *τ* = 0.90*λ*/*β*cos*θ*, where *τ*, *λ*, *β*, and *θ* is the mean size of grain size, the [X-ray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray) [wavelength](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavelength), the line broadening at half the maximum [intensity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensity_(physics)), and the [Bragg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bragg_diffraction) angle, respectively, the crystallite sizes of the as-deposited Ni and Ni–Zn alloys before and after leaching were estimated to be around 28.4, 20.5, and 19.8 nm, respectively. Clearly, the addition of Zn into Ni inhibited the crystal growth of Ni nanocrystallites. This could be caused by the anomalous codeposition occurred over the electrodeposition of Ni–Zn alloy.[40]

Figure 3 gives the SEM images and corresponding profiles of EDX for the Ni, the as-plated Ni–Zn alloy and leached Ni–Zn alloy film samples. It can be seen that the Ni and as-plated Ni– Zn films are composed of a large number of irregular spheres with the particle diameters in the range of about 150 to 400 nm. In contrast, a significant change can be clearly observed in the morphology for the leached Ni–Zn alloy film. As shown in Figure 3c, the film has an open nanowall network structure composed of interconnected nanosheets, and each nanosheet, with a thickness of about 45 nm (which is determined by the SEM image of inset of Figure 3c), is randomly grown on the sub-film.

Based on the results of EDX analyses, the Zn content is reduced markedly after electrochemical leaching, and the Ni/Zn molar in Ni-Zn alloys before and after electrochemical leaching is 1.23 and 6.04, respectively, corresponding to Ni<sub>55.16</sub>Zn<sub>44.84</sub> and Ni<sub>85,78</sub>Zn<sub>14,20</sub>. This result is basically in accordance with the ICP-AES analysis. The skeletal Ni catalysts with micro-cracks or micro-porous structure were usually obtained by selectively chemical or electrochemical dissolution of Zn from the electrodeposited Ni-Zn alloys. [38,39] In the present work, the mechanism of the formation of nanosheets in the dealloying process has remained unclear. This could be associated with the preparation of conditions. It was observed that there exist two layers at the Ni foam subtract by a close examination of SEM image (Figure 3b); the top layer consists of some irregular spheres. These spheres after the electrochemical dissolution become the open nanosheets, and there exist some microcracks (the inset of Figure 3c) at the bottom layer, similar to what is known for the Ni-Zn alloy after chemical leaching in the alkaline solution. [37] The results imply that this electrochemical leaching does not equally affect the deposited layer over its full depth; the incompletely leached alloy at the bottom probably plays a key role in guaranteeing the adhesion of the active layer to the substrate. The as-prepared Ni-Zn alloy catalyst with the open nanowall network structure should allow the full access of reactants to the surface active sites of the catalyst, thereby ensuring a favorable catalytic performance from a structural point of view.

Before the usage, the developed Ni–Zn/Ni foam was activated to minimize the influence of its thin passive film in a 3.0 M  $N_2H_4\cdot H_2O$  and 1.0 M NaOH solution at 30 °C for 5 min, and then the electrocatalytic property for hydrazine oxidation was examined and compared with the Ni/Ni foam and pure Ni foam catalysts. As shown in Figure 4, the Ni foam itself is observed to have a moderate activity for hydrazine oxidation under the applied operating conditions. It presents a current density of 168.3 mA cm $^{-2}$  at 0.40 V and an onset potential of about 0.00 V. After Ni deposition, the current density of resulting Ni/Ni foam increased about 30% than that of the pure Ni foam, and the onset potential was found to be a negative shift of 57 mV. Among the three electrocatalysts examined, the developed Ni–Zn foam catalyst exhibits the best catalytic performance for

hydrazine oxidation in terms of the current density at 0.40 V and onset potential, which are observed at about 300 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> and – 0.15 V, respectively. Remarkably, the property of Ni/Ni foam electrode was significantly improved with Zn addition. The onset potential agreed well with the current state of the art Ni<sub>0.87</sub>Zn<sub>0.13</sub> powder, which was reported by Martinez et al. in their study of catalyzing hydrazine oxidation.<sup>[31]</sup> The low onset potential of hydrazine oxidation will offer high cell efficiency. In summary, the performance of developed catalyst towards hydrazine oxidation compares favorably with the catalysts reported to date, which is superior to the commercial Pt/C catalyst reported, as seen in Table 1.

The catalyst durability is another important factor that determines its effectiveness in the long-term operation of fuel cells. The stability of developed Ni-Zn/Ni foam electrode is first investigated by chronoamperometry (CA) (Figure 5a). The result shows that the developed electrode can steadily remain its initial activity of 75.4% after 2000 s. In contrast, the Ni foam and Ni/Ni foam can only reach the initial activity of 42.3% and 35.6%, respectively. The stability of this binder-free electrode was also evaluated by monitoring the change of current density in a cyclic usage (Figure 5b). The Ni-Zn/Ni foam showed excellent stability for hydrazine oxidation, with only 8.4% loss of the initial current density after 1000 cycles, but the Ni/Ni foam and Ni foam can only retain the initial activity of 32.8% and 14.5%, respectively. The reason for excellent stability of the Ni-Zn/Ni foam is that the extremely high oxophilicity of the Zn metal could help in preventing passivation of Ni and extend its durability.

Employment of electrodeposition and alloying strategies have yielded a high-performance binder-free electrode, which displays excellent activity and good cycling stability towards hydrazine oxidation reaction. As stated above, the addition of Zn into Ni induced reduction of the Ni nanocrystallite size, which should be a factor contributing to high electrocatalytic activity. The surface area caused by the morphology difference is considered to be another factor, since the large area could provide more active sites for hydrazine oxidation, and further results in an efficient catalytic reaction. Based on the ratio values of differential double-layer capacitance of the measured and the pure Hg electrodes (20 μF cm–2) (Figure 6a), the electrochemical surface area (ESAs) of Ni foam, Ni/Ni foam and leached Ni–Zn/Ni foam were 28.5, 66.1, and 295.8 cm2 , respectively. The trend is consistent with that of the catalytic activity, implying that the ESA was a key factor leading to different catalytic activities. Figure 6b gives the Nyquist diagrams of pure Ni foam, Ni/Ni foam, and Ni−Zn/Ni foam in 0.10 M N2H4·H2O and 1.0 M NaOH solution. It can be observed that all the Nyquist diagrams display a pronounced semicircle arc in the measured frequency region. The semicircle diameter of Ni−Zn/Ni foam is much smaller than that of pure Ni foam and Ni/Ni foam, indicating low reaction resistance on the Ni−Zn/Ni foam electrocatalyst and ensuring a very faster electron-transfer rate.

On the other hand, our study found that Zn film was nearly inactive for the oxidation of hydrazine, but the catalytic performance of Ni/Ni foam was significantly improved with addition of appropriate Zn. It is well-known that Zn-doping can improve the catalytic property of Ni.[31,32] Similarly, our obtained results suggest that the high activity observed for the Ni−Zn/Ni foam could be closely associated with the Ni alloying with Zn. A DFT calculation of hydrazine adsorption on Ni suggested that the binding energy of hydrazine to Ni in the presence of Zn is much lower than that of [monometallic](https://www.baidu.com/link?url=qFjsp0FYKFp4Rz-yW72AphBgBxjhgtpQSe9TXKDarR-bUmZGb7gJGNpKiDks2q-qnYMidKRhEKL_ToXYmsD4DgYYdG1G5aikHh8yJxrYzk7&wd=&eqid=dea3c19d000521a600000003583a3bf1) Ni.[31] This implies that the contribution of Zn is to weak the strength of Ni−N bond such that

hydrazine can be easily oxidized to N2 and H2O step by step via N−H bond cleavage in an alkaline medium. In order to gain insight into the Zn-induced modification of catalytic activity, we introduced XPS analysis to probe the electronic states of the catalysts. As shown in Figure 7, the metallic Ni0 (Ni 2p3/2 852.37 eV) and Zn<sup>0</sup> (Zn 2p3/2 1021.17 eV) exit along with oxide states (NiO/Ni(OH)2, Ni 2p3/2 855.53 eV and ZnO, Zn 2p3/2 1022.05 eV) in the Ni−Zn/Ni foam. The presence of Ni and Zn oxides is due to the preparation procedure and atmospheric exposure. The Ni0 2p3/2 peak of Ni–Zn/Ni foam manifests a negative shift of 0.18 eV relative to that of Ni/Ni foam, indicating modification of the electronic structure of Ni in response to the Ni alloying with Zn. Hence, the Zn acts as an electron donor and its incorporation results in an increase of electron density of Ni active center. As a consequence, back electron donation from Ni to the antibonding orbital of N2H4 could be enhanced, leading to a destabilization of the Ni–N2H4 interaction and weaker N–H bond, which induces higher activity. This consideration may roughly explain the activity enhancement.

#### **3. Conclusion**

A Ni foam-supported Ni–Zn alloy catalyst was prepared by the electrodeposition of Ni–Zn alloy and subsequent dealloying in an alkaline solution, which was composed of α-NiZn alloy phase. The resultant Ni–Zn/Ni foam with the open nanowall network structure, taking advantage of high electrical conductivity of Ni foam, and strong adhesion between the film and substrate endowed by the electrodeposition process, presents high catalytic activity and good cycling stability towards the hydrazine oxidation in alkaline medium. In addition, this performance advantage should be understood as combined effects of Zntailored electronic structure of Ni as well as enhanced ESA of the catalyst and reduced reaction resistance [of hydrazine](http://jes.ecsdl.org/content/162/14/F1415.short) oxidation. The developed binder-free highly efficient of Ni–Zn/Ni foam catalyst is of clear significance for the application in DHFCs in the future.

### **4. Experimental Section**

*Chemicals and preparation of the catalysts:* All chemicals were of analytical grade and were used as received without any further treatment. Distilled water was used throughout the study and all glass wares were washed with HCl solution and distilled water in succession and dried in an oven before usage. The Ni foam (INCO ATM Co. Ltd., 1.85 mm in thickness) has an open pore structure with an area density of about 650 g m<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> , and an average pore size of 0.25–0.80 mm. Before usage, the Ni

foam was cleaned by sonicating in ethanol for 10 min, followed by immersing in a 1.0 M HCl solution to remove surface oxide for 1 min. The Ni and Ni–Zn alloy films were prepared by an electrodeposition process in a modified Watts type bath. The bath composition and operating conditions used was shown in Table 2. To prepare for the target catalyst, the above as-prepared Ni−Zn alloy/Ni foam was electrochemically dealloyed to leach off Zn. Here, the dealloying protocol involved a voltammetric experiment in a 1.0 M NaOH solution at room temperature from –0.3 to +0.6 V vs. the RHE at pH 14 with a scanning rate of 40 mV s–1. The catalyst loading was determined by measuring the weight of the Ni foam before and after plating. The loading for Ni and Ni–Zn/Ni foam catalyst samples was 2.76 and 2.04 mg cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> , respectively. The resultant Ni–Zn/Ni foam was dissolved in 35 wt% HNO3, and the Ni and Zn contents in the Ni–Zn coating were determined using an inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES, Iris Intrepid) after subtracting the Ni content of substrate.

*Electrochemical measurement:* The electrochemical experiments were carried out in a three-electrode glass cell connected to an electrochemical workstation (Princeton applied research, PARSTAT MC 2000). A Pt sheet and Hg/HgO immersed in 1.0 M NaOH solution were used as a counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively, and the pure Ni foam, Ni and Ni–Zn/Ni foam with a geometric area of 1.0 cm<sup>2</sup> were used as the working electrodes. All potentials were reported with respect to the RHE at pH 14. Cyclic voltammetry (CV), linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and chronoamperometry (CA) measurements were performed to study the activity, stability, and electrochemical surface area (ESA). Alternating-current impedance measurements were carried out in the same configuration at the open circuit potential from 103 to 0.1 Hz. The electrolyte solution was deoxygenated by bubbling Ar gas for at least 15 minutes before each measurement.

*Characterization:* The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku D/max-2500, Cu Kα radiation) was employed to analyze the crystal structures of catalyst samples. The morphology of catalyst samples were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, MERLIN) that was equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis unit (Oxford). The surface elements and their electronic states of the catalysts were analyzed using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ESCALAB 250, Al Kα X-ray source). All the binding energies were calibrated using the C1s peak at 284.6 eV of the adventitious carbon as an internal standard. The curve fitting was performed by XPS PEAK 4.1 software.

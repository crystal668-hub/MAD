**Herein, the construction of a heterostructured 1D/3D CoN-Co2N@NF (nickel foam) electrode used for thermodynamically favorable hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR), as an alternative to sluggish anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in water splitting for hydrogen production, is reported. The electrode exhibits remarkable catalytic activities, with an onset potential of −0.11 V in HzOR and −71 mV for a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Consequently, an extraordinary low cell voltage of 53 mV is required to achieve 10 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> for overall hydrazine splitting in a two-electrode system, demonstrating significant energy-saving advantages over conventional water splitting. The HzOR proceeds through the 4e<sup>−</sup> reaction pathway to release N2 while the 1e<sup>−</sup> pathway to emit NH3 is uncompetitive, as evidenced by differential electrochemical mass spectrometric measurements. The X-ray absorption spectroscopy, in situ Raman spectroscopy, and theoretical calculations identify cobalt nitrides rather than corresponding oxides/(oxy)hydroxides as catalytic species for HzOR and illustrate advantages of heterostructured CoN-Co2N in optimizing adsorption energies of intermediates/reagents and promoting catalytic activities toward both HzOR and HER. The CoN-Co2N@NF is also an excellent supercapacitive material, exhibiting an increased specific capacity (938 F g<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> at 1 A g<sup>−</sup>1) with excellent cycling stability (95.8%, 5000 cycles).**

development of sustainable and low-carbon energy is key to solving these issues.[1–6] Hydrogen, with a high energy density of 142.351 MJ kg<sup>−</sup>1, has emerged as a promising, renewable, and pollution-free energy carrier for storing intermittent solar and wind energies.[7] The electrocatalytic water splitting is a promising method for producing hydrogen.[8–12] However, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER, 4OH<sup>−</sup> → O2 + 2H2O + 4e<sup>−</sup>, 1.23 V vs RHE) as the anodic half-reaction has a high thermodynamic potential and is kinetically sluggish due to the 4H<sup>+</sup>/4e<sup>−</sup> transfer process. This not only results in large energy consumption but also significantly limits largescale applications for the high cost associated with the use of precious metal-based electrocatalysts.[13–19] Therefore, alternative strategies are urgently required to minimize the anodic energy consumption.

Recent studies have demonstrated that the barrier to sluggish OER can be overcome by using thermodynamically more favorable electro-oxidation of small molecules, such as glycerol,[20] benzyl alcohol,[21] urea,[22] 5-hydroxymethylfurfural,[23] and hydrazine.[24] The oxidation

of these molecules not only upgrades them into high-value chemicals or degrades them into pollution-free substances, but also greatly reduces the cell voltage for hydrogen production.[25] Among these alternative half reactions, the hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR, N2H4 + 4OH<sup>−</sup> → N2 + 4H2O + 4e<sup>−</sup>) exhibits an ultralow oxidation potential (−0.33 V vs RHE), as shown in **Scheme 1**. [26–28] Moreover, the concurrent production of ecologically friendly N2 in anodic HzOR and H2 in cathodic HER (i.e., overall hydrazine splitting, OHzS) is much safer than explosive O2/H2 mixture produced by water splitting.[29,30] The use of HzOR instead of OER thus also adds benefits of degrading toxic hydrazine residues in industrial wastewater.[31] Hydrazine is widely used as a deoxidizer in power plant feedwater, high energy fuels, and raw material industries, and its production, utilization, and disposal can seriously endanger human safety, health, and ecosystems.[32] Pioneering researches have led to significant advances in hydrazine-assisted hydrogen production. For instance, Zhang et al. developed bifunctional P, W co-doped Co3N

nanowire (NW) arrays with exceptional catalytic activities toward both HzOR and HER, which required a low cell voltage of 28 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> in a two-electrode setup, representing one of best OHzS performances achieved to date.[33] Xie et al. constructed novel dual nanoislands on Ni/C hybrid nanosheet arrays for OHzS, which exhibited excellent activity with an ultrasmall cell voltage of 0.2 V to achieve a current density of 50 mA  $cm^{-2}$ .[34]

Supercapacitors have gained great attention in the energy storage field because of their fast charge and discharge rates, adaptability to harsh environments, and excellent safety, making them one of the most promising technologies to date. [35–37] To increase their energy/power outputs, the material designing should consider physical morphologies, surface properties, elemental compositions, and inherent electrical conductivities. In general, the material (Faradaic redox properties) electrodes prepared from transition metal oxides/hydroxides and sulfide compounds have good redox properties and high theoretical capacitance values, but these electrodes usually exhibit low rate properties and poor cycling capacity. Therefore, it is urgent to develop new composites with synergistic properties and rich electrochemical properties, which is conducive to the development of high-performance supercapacitors.[38,39]

Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) have gained significant attention in various applications due to their low cost, adjustable lamellar structures, intrinsic catalytic activity, and durability. [40,41] In addition, metal hydroxides can be readily grown on various substrates, making them widely used as a general platform for fabricating hierarchical structures. However, the limited porosity, insulation, and small surface areas of LDH-based catalysts impede their catalytic performance and widespread use. In contrast, Prussian blue analogues (PBAs), a class of metal-organic framework (MOF) with the general formula  $A_x M_1^{I}[M_2^{II}(CN)_6]_v \cdot nH_2O$ (A represents alkali metal ion and M<sub>1</sub> and M<sub>2</sub> are transition metals), possess open frameworks consisting of M<sub>1</sub>I-CN-M<sub>2</sub>II. [42-44] The large surface area, intrinsic porosity, excellent electrical conductivity, as well as structural diversity of PBAs make them suitable materials for electrochemical applications.<sup>[45,46]</sup> However, PBAs tend to aggregate during high-temperature pyrolysis for conversion to various functional nanomaterials, especially in the powder form, resulting in unsatisfactory electrochemical performance. The fabrication of multidimensional nanostructures,

e.g., including integrated LDHs and PBAs in the process may benefit from advantages of individual materials while eliminate their disadvantages, which however remains a significant challenge.

Herein, we have developed a synthetic strategy for constructing multi-dimensional nanostructure CoN-Co2N@NF catalytic electrode that combines the advantages of integrated LDHs and PBAs as precursors, exhibiting an outstanding performance for both HzOR and HER. First, we grew 1D Co(OH), nanowires on conductive nickel foam (NF). Then, we successfully converted partial 1D Co(OH)2 nanowires into 3D PBA nanocubes, forming a 1D/3D CoPBA/Co(OH), @NF hybrid structure. After a thermal ammonolysis process, we obtained the final 1D/3D CoN-Co<sub>2</sub>N@NF heterogeneous assembling body, which maintained the morphology and structure of the precursor. Such design is beneficial because 3D PBA nanocubes can be arranged regularly and grown on the surface of 1D Co(OH), nanowires to form expected heterostructure. In 1.0 m KOH/0.1 m N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> solution, the CoN-Co2N@NF electrode exhibits an ultralow onset potential of -0.11 V (vs RHE) toward hydrazine oxidation. As a bifunctional electrocatalyst, it also delivers a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> for the HER at a low overpotential of 71 mV. When used as both anode and cathode in a two-electrode electrolyzer for OHzS, the CoN-Co2N@NF catalysts resulted in an extraordinary low cell voltage of only 53 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, with high long-term durability. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the CoN-Co<sub>2</sub>N heterogeneous assembling body can not only largely decrease the free-energy change of the dehydrogenation of adsorbed N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> (\*NH<sub>2</sub>NH<sub>2</sub>), but also make the free energy change of adsorbed H ( $\Delta G_{H^*}$ ) more thermoneutral compared to individual CoN and Co2N. The integrated CoN-Co2N@NF is also an excellent supercapacitive material, delivering an enhanced specific capacity (938 F g<sup>-1</sup> at 1 A g<sup>-1</sup>) with exceptional capacity retention of 95.8% following sequential 5000 cycles at 15 A g<sup>-1</sup>. The high performances of CoN-Co<sub>2</sub>N@NF are attributed to the unique multi-dimensional nanostructures with a large surface area, high conductivity, and synergistic effect of 1D/3D heterointerfaces. This work provides an encouraging inspiration for rationally designing efficient catalytic and capacitive materials toward hydrazine-assisted H<sub>2</sub> production and energy storage.

## **2. Results and Discussion**

#### **2.1. Morphological and Structural Characterizations**

A facile three-step process is used to synthesize the 1D/3D CoN-Co2N@NF heterogeneous assembling body, as illustrated in **Figure 1**a. First, 1D Co(OH)2 nanowire arrays are in situ grown on nickel foam using a low-temperature hydrothermal approach. Next, well-dispersed CoPBA nanocubes are further grown on the 1D Co(OH)2 nanowires with the addition of K3Co(CN)6, where the Co(OH)2 nanowires act as a self-sacrificial template. The final product CoN-Co2N@NF is obtained by thermal annealing at 400 °C for 2 h in an NH3 atmosphere. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images show the morphologies of Co(OH)2@NF (Figure 1b), CoPBA/Co(OH)2@NF (Figure 1c), and CoN-Co2N@NF (Figure 1d), respectively. The average size of nanowires and nanocubes is about 60 nm (inset of Figure 1b) and 500 nm (inset of Figure 1c), respectively. The CoN-Co2N@NF heterogeneous assembling body features nanocube-on-nanowire hybrid structure, which is generally unaltered during the phase transformation upon annealing. Notably, the resulting material exhibits a porous sponge-like morphology, which is key to enhancing electrocatalytic performance. The TEM image (Figure 1e) shows that the nanowire is covered by numerous nanocubes. The HRTEM image (Figure 1f) shows clear lattice fringes with interplanar distances of 2.12 and 2.17 Å, associated with the (111) and (002) planes of the hexagonal Co2N phase, respectively, while the lattice distance of 2.48 Å can be attributed to the (111) plane of the CoN phase. The energy-dispersive Xray (EDX) elemental analysis (Figure 1g) exhibits a homogeneous distribution of Co and N elements throughout the entire structure.

Figure 2. SEM morphological evolution of  $Co_2N@NF$ . The  $CoPBA/Co(OH)_2@NF$  as the precursor electrode was prepared by different reaction times and it was then annealed at different nitridation temperatures.

To investigate the growth mechanism of PBA, we varied the reaction time from 0.5 to 6 h, as presented in Figure S1 (Supporting Information). In the growth process,  $Co^{2+}$  ions are released from the surface of  $Co(OH)_2$  nanowires in the weak acidic  $K_3Co(CN)_6$  solution, predominantly at the top of the nanowires. At the solid-liquid interface,  $Co^{2+}$  ions dissolved from  $Co(OH)_2$  nanowires are coordinated with  $Co(CN)_6^{3-}$  ions, resulting in an interfacial growth of PBA nanocubes. The ion exchange of  $Co^{2+}$  ions with  $K^+$  enables the CoPBA nanocubes to form scaffolds on  $Co(OH)_2$  nanowires, while  $OH^-$  ions released cause a progressive increase in pH value, note the below equation

$$Co(OH)_2$$
 (s) +  $K_3Co(CN)_6$  (aq)  $\rightarrow K_xCoCo(CN)_6$  (s) +  $2OH^-$  (aq) +  $(3-x)K^+$  (1)

With the size and quantity of PBA nanocubes increased, the covering of nanowires and the increase of solution pH gradually inhibit the interfacial reaction, reaching an equilibrium in PBA growth. This reaction is reversible, as it has been reported that PBA can be converted back to form Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> under alkaline conditions.<sup>[47]</sup> The crystal structure and corresponding (hkl) in-

dex parameter of CoPBA nanocubes are shown in Figure S2 (Supporting Information).

To probe the morphological and structural evolution of CoN-Co<sub>2</sub>N@NF, we prepared a set of samples with different reaction times from 0.5 to 6 h and at various ammonolysis temperatures from 300 to 500 °C. The SEM images of samples prepared by these orthogonal experiments are shown in Figure 2. In general, the reaction time >2 h produces excessive CoPBA nanocubes and consumes most Co(OH), nanowires, while the ammonolysis temperature >400 °C causes structural collapse. The results thus suggest that reaction time of 2 h and ammonolysis temperature of 400 °C are the optimized experimental conditions for synthesis of CoN-Co<sub>2</sub>N@NF in terms of morphological features. For comparison, Co(OH), nanowires were also annealed at different temperatures in a NH3 atmosphere, as shown in Figure S3 (Supporting Information). As the temperature increased, the morphology of nanowires gradually collapsed, ultimately forming nanoparticles. A CoN@NF electrode prepared by direct nitridation of Co(OH), @NF at 400 °C was prepared as a contrast sample for electrocatalytic test below.

Figure S4a (Supporting Information) shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of CoPBA/Co(OH)<sub>2</sub>@NF by different reaction times. Aside from the diffraction signals of Ni substrate at

44.5° and 51.8° (JCPDS: 04-0850), the peak at 35.5° is attributed to the (111) plane, which is indexed with Co(OH)2 (JCPDS: 50- 0827). By increasing the reaction time, the intensity of the diffraction peak of Co3[Co(CN)6]2 (JCPDS: 89-3737) at around 17.4° gradually increases, indicating the growth of CoPBA nanocubes on Co(OH)2 nanowires. The effect of thermal annealing temperature on the material crystal structure was also explored. It is found that the low-temperature annealing at 300 °C tends to produce the less hexagonal CoN, while elevating the temperature to 500 °C results in formation of the cubic Co2N phase (Figure S4b, Supporting Information). This is consistent with the decrease in nitrogen content along with the increase in reaction temperature. Similarly, the EDX mapping of CoN-Co2N@NF at different temperatures (Figure S5 and Table S1, Supporting Information) reveals the coincident observation. These results indicate that the

ammonolysis temperature plays a significant role on the morphology and composition of final products.

**Figure 3**a shows XRD pattern of CoN-Co2N scraped off from the nickel foam. Two diffraction peaks are observed at 36.2° and 61.3°, which are attributable to (111) and (220) crystallographic planes of CoN (JCPDS: 16-0116). In addition, four characteristic peaks at 39.1°, 41.5°, 42.7°, and 44.5°, corresponding to (020), (002), (111), and (021) planes of the Co2N (JCPDS: 72-1368) are also observed, indicating the successful synthesis of the CoN-Co2N heterogeneous assembly body. For the FTIR and Raman spectra shown in Figure 3b,c, the typical characteristic peak for the cyano bridge (C≡N) at around 2180 cm<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> is observed for CoPBA and CoPBA/Co(OH)2@NF, suggesting the generation of PBA on the surface of Co(OH)2. This peak disappears in CoN-Co2N, indicating that PBA has been completely converted to

cobalt nitrides. To demonstrate the effect of nitration treatment, the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface areas and Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) pore sizes of CoPBA/Co(OH)<sub>2</sub>, Co<sub>2</sub>N, and CoN-Co<sub>2</sub>N were investigated. BET curves in Figure 3d demonstrate a IV-type shape, revealing a much higher specific surface area of CoN-Co<sub>2</sub>N (64.96 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>) than Co<sub>2</sub>N (14.4 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>) and CoPBA/Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> (5.74 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>). In addition, CoN-Co<sub>2</sub>N has distinct pore distribution in the range of 3-10 nm. Based on BET and BJH results, the CoN-Co<sub>2</sub>N electrode has much higher mesoporous surface area and pore volume, providing more active sites and improving electrochemical performance.

To further examine the surface valence state of CoN-Co<sub>2</sub>N@NF, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were carried out. Figure S6 (Supporting Information) exhibits the overall spectrum of CoN-Co<sub>2</sub>N@NF, indicating the existence of Co and N elements, which coincides with the above EDX results. The high-resolution Co 2p XPS of CoN-Co<sub>2</sub>N@NF is present in Figure 3e. The signals at 780.2 and 795.8 eV are attributed to the Co-N bond in the CoN phase, with satellited peaks at 786.5 and 802.7 eV.[33] These bingding energies are located between those for CoN@NF and Co2N@NF. The two spin-split peaks at 782.3 and 797.9 eV are associated with the surface oxidation. [48,49] The N 1s XPS (Figure 3f) can be deconvoluted to metal-N (397.5 eV) and N-H (399.6 eV) peaks, respectively, confirming the formation of metal nitrides and the presence of a large amount of N-H species on the surface of the catalyst.<sup>[50]</sup> Figure S7 (Supporting Information) shows a comparison of XPS spectra of CoN-Co2N@NF at different temperatures. At the elevated temperature, the content of Co element increases, while the content of N element gradually decreases. These XPS results indicate the formation of CoN and Co<sub>2</sub>N composite with electronic interaction at the coupled

To investigate the coordination environment of CoN-Co<sub>2</sub>N@NF, we conducted further characterization using X-ray absorption near-edge structure (EXNES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS). In Figure 3g, the Co K-edge XANES spectra of CoN-Co<sub>2</sub>N (powder scratched off from nickle foam), CoO, Co $_2$ O $_3$ , and Co foil are shown. The absorption edges of CoN-Co<sub>2</sub>N is situated between those of CoO and Co<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, suggesting a Co valence between +2 and +3, consistent with the Co 2p XPS results. The Fourier transform (FT) of the Co K edge EXAFS spectrum in Figure 3h reveals coodination environments of cobalt. Two characteristic peaks in R space correspond well with the first coordination shells of ordinary Co-N (≈1.4 Å) and Co—Co (≈2.2 Å). FT-EXAFS fitting, as depicted in Figure S8a (Supporting Information), provides additional insights into CoN-Co<sub>2</sub>N, indicating a coordination number of  $\approx 3$  for the central Co atom with the surrounding N atoms, and a coordination number of around 4 for the Co-Co (second shell) interactions. Detailed fitting results can be found in Table S1 (Supporting Information). To further enhance the clarity of the coordination environment in CoN-Co<sub>2</sub>N, we employed wavelet transform (WT) on the EXAFS oscillation of the Co K edge because of the high resolution of the K and R spaces. The WT contour line plots confirm the presence of typical Co—Co bonds ( $\approx 10.5 \text{ Å}^{-1}$ ) and Co–N bond (centered at  $\approx 9.5 \text{ Å}^{-1}$ ) in CoN-Co<sub>2</sub>N (Figure 3i). For Co foil, the WT plot (Figure S8b, Supporting Information) reveals a Co—Co bond ( $\approx$ 7.5 Å<sup>-1</sup>).

#### 2.2. Electrocatalytic OER/HzOR and HER Performances

The electrocatalytic performance toward the HzOR was evaluated in a typical three-electrode configuration in a 1.0 м КОН/0.1 м N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> solution. The catalytic activity of CoN-Co<sub>2</sub>N@NF was optimized in Figure S9 (Supporting Information), where the sample with a PBA reaction time of 2 h followed by annealing at 400 °C exhibits the best catalytic activity. From linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves in Figure 4a, the CoN-Co2N@NF exhibits a remarkable catalytic activity toward the HzOR compare to the OER. The catalytic onset occurs at a very negative potential of -0.11 V, and an ultralow potential of -0.026 V is required to deliver a high current density of 100 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. In stark contrast, the OER achieves the same current level at 1.603 V. The decrease of anode potential is crucial for achieving the low-cost hydrogen production. To determine the active component toward HzOR, we evaluated the performances of Co(OH), @NF, CoPBA/Co(OH)2@NF, CoN@NF, Co2N@NF, CoN-Co2N@NF, and Pt/C coated on nickel foam under the identical conditions (Figure 4b). Co(OH), @NF and CoPBA/Co(OH), @NF are found to be inactive for HzOR. The 1D/3D CoN-Co2N@NF heterogeneous assembly has better HzOR activity than individual CoN@NF and Co2N@NF thanks to the synergistic effect between 1D nanowires and 3D nanocubes. The high porosity of the 3D porous nanocubes skeleton provide a huge accessible center for the insertion and extraction of OH- ions and hydrazine hydrate, thus expanding the interface contact area, facilitating the release of the resulting gases and bubbles, and accelerating the electron/proton transfer rate. It is indicated that the construction of such nanostructure is of great significance to improve the electrochemical performance. The CoN-Co<sub>2</sub>N@NF also outperforms most reported materials, such as  $Cu_1Ni_2-N$  (0.5 mV@10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>), [27] Fe-CoS<sub>2</sub> (129 mV@100 mA  $cm^{-2}$ ),<sup>[51]</sup>  $Ni_2$ P/Ni foam (-25 mV@50 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>),<sup>[32]</sup> and  $Ni_x$ P/Ni foam (100 mV@172 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>).[52] The CoN-Co<sub>2</sub>N@NF shows a smaller Tafel slope (42 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>) than CoN@NF (81 mV  $dec^{-1}$ ),  $Co_2N@NF(45 \text{ mV } dec^{-1})$ , and Pt/C (58 mV  $dec^{-1}$ ), indicating more favorable catalytic kinetics toward HzOR, as shown in Figure 4c. To test the intrinsic activity of CoN-Co2N@NF toward HzOR, we measured LSV curves at different hydrazine concentrations (Figure 4d). The catalytic current density increases sharply by adding 0.05 м hydrazine, and it continues to increase until the concentration of hydrazine reaches 0.4 м. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was applied to study the catalytic kinetics during the HzOR. From the Nyquist curves in Figure 4e, the CoN-Co<sub>2</sub>N@NF has the smaller charge transfer resistance ( $R_{ct}$ ) compared to the CoN@NF and Co<sub>2</sub>N@NF, suggesting faster charge transfer and more favorable HzOR kinetics. The long-term stability of CoN-Co2N@NF was evaluated by the chronoamperometry test at -0.08 V for 20 h (Figure 4f). The slight current decrease is presumably caused by the gradual consumption of the reagent. The LSV curve after continuous cyclic voltammetry (CV) scan of 2000 cycles shows negligible attenuation, demonstrating excellent stability.

The HER activity of CoN-Co<sub>2</sub>N@NF was also examined in 1.0 м KOH and compared to those of contrast samples, as shown in Figure 4g. The CoN-Co2N@NF requires an overpotential of 71 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. Notably, the performance of CoN-Co<sub>2</sub>N@NF is better than that

of commercial Pt/C as the current density exceeds 100 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, and it is also superior over recently reported HER catalysts based on transition metal nitrides, like NiCoN/C nanocages (103 mV)<sup>[53]</sup> and Co-Ni<sub>3</sub>N (194 mV).<sup>[54]</sup> To probe the electrode kinetics, the corresponding Tafel plots were further analyzed (Figure 4h), where a much smaller Tafel slope of 84 mV dec<sup>-1</sup> is obtained compared to that of Co(OH)<sub>2</sub>@NF (140 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>), CoN@NF (112 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>), Co<sub>2</sub>N@NF (140 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>),  $CoPBA/Co(OH)_2@NF$  (56 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>), and Pt/C (56 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>). These results suggest that the dual components of the CoN-Co<sub>2</sub>N@NF catalyst and the synergy effect between 1D nanowires and 3D nanocubes play a critical role in the HER process compared to individual CoN@NF and Co2N@NF. In addition, CoN-Co<sub>2</sub>N@NF also shows satisfied long-term durability, as signified by the chronoamperometric test for 20 h (Figure 4i) along with chemical and morphological characterizations (Figure S10, Supporting Information).

To rationalize the intrinsic catalytic activity of the catalysts, we measured electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) of different catalysts by obtaining the  $C_{\rm dl}$  (double-layer capacitance) (Figure S11, Supporting Information). The C<sub>dl</sub> of CoN-Co<sub>2</sub>N@NF (36.6 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>) is significantly larger than that of Co(OH)<sub>2</sub>@NF (1.02 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>) and CoPBA/Co(OH)<sub>2</sub>@NF (1.09 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>). In addition, the CoN-Co2N@NF annealed at 400 °C shows the highest ECSA among samples of different ammonolysis temperatures, accounting for the best intrinsic electrocatalytic performance toward the HzOR. Therefore, selecting the appropriate ammonolysis temperature is essential for constructing the highperformance electrocatalyst.

To further identify the active species in the HzOR, we performed in situ Raman spectroscopic measurements on the CoN-Co<sub>2</sub>N@NF. Typically, in the OER process, a broad peak of oxyhydroxide between 500 and 600 cm<sup>-1</sup> is observable associated with the transformation of metal nitrides to metal

oxyhydroxides.[54–56] By contrast, the peaks for CoN-Co2N@NF remain unchanged by increasing the applied potential to 0.9 V versus RHE, as shown in **Figure 5**a, indicating little surface modification during the HzOR under the condition. Hence, it can be considered that the metal nitride itself is the true active component for the HzOR, and few metal oxyhydroxides are formed during the catalytic process. The SEM image (Figure S12a,b, Supporting Information) shows that the 1D/3D nanowires and nanocubes are well-preserved after the HzOR process, while the XRD pattern of the post-HzOR catalyst retains nearly unchanged (Figure S12c, Supporting Information). Furthermore, the XPS spectra of CoN-Co2N@NF after a 20-h chronoamperometry test confirm the presence of Co and N (Figure 5b,c) with insignificant change in the Co 2p and N 1s peaks, further supporting the high stability of the CoN-Co2N@NF during the HzOR.

On-line differential electrochemical mass spectroscopy (DEMS) was utilized to monitor the gaseous products during the HzOR by CoN-Co2N (Figure 5d,e). At the open-circuit potential (OCP), the absence of current density indicates no gaseous products from HzOR under this condition. However, when an oxidation potential of 0 and 0.3 V versus RHE is applied, there is a significant increase in N2 (*m*/*z* = 28) with only trace NH3 detected during HzOR. There is also signal for H2 (*m*/*z* = 2) as increases the potential, which is presumably from H2 generated in the counter electrode during the HzOR. In general, the HzOR in alkaline media typically follows the below pathways [reactions (2) and (3), electrochemical decomposition; reaction (4), chemical decomposition] to produce N2 and NH3. [30]

$$N_2H_4 + 4OH^- \rightarrow N_2 + 4H_2O + 4e^-$$
 (2)

$$N_2H_4 + OH^- \rightarrow 1/2N_2 + NH_3 + H_2O + e^-$$
 (3)

$$3N_2H_4 \rightarrow N_2 + 4NH_3 \tag{4}$$

In alkaline media, hydrazine undergoes complete oxidation to N2 and H2O through a 4e<sup>−</sup> electrochemical reaction (1). In addition, incomplete dehydrogenation of hydrazine through 1e<sup>−</sup> electrochemical oxidation (2) or a dissociation reaction (3) often yields a small amount of NH3. The absence of mass signals at m/z 30 (NO), 44 (N2O), and 46 (NO2) detected by the DEMS indicates the absence of oxygen intermediates in the HzOR process. Moreover, the absence of any gasous products rules out the possibility of the chemical decomposition of N2H4 into NH3 through reaction (3). Therefore, the above results suggest that the electrochemical oxidation of hydrazine on CoN-Co2N parimarily occurs through reaction (1), with a minor contribution from reaction (2).

#### **2.3. Evaluation of CoN-Co2N@NF as a Bifunctional Catalyst for OHzS**

Building upon the superior bifunctional HzOR and HER performances of CoN-Co2N@NF, we explored its potential application for electrocatalytic H2 production via overall hydrazine splitting (OHzS) in a two-electrode electrolyzer of CoN-Co2N@NF||CoN-Co2N@NF, in 1.0 m KOH/0.1 m N2H4. The LSV curves of OHzS and overall water splitting (OWS) in 1.0 m KOH are compared in **Figure 6**a. The results show that hydrazine oxidation-assisted H2 production significantly enhances energy efficiency, requiring a cell voltage of only 53 mV to reach a current density of

**Figure 6.** a) LSV curves for OHzS in 1.0 m KOH/0.1 m N2H4 and OWS in 1.0 m KOH using the CoN-Co2N@NF as both anode and cathode. b) Voltages for different current densities in OHzS and OWS. c) Comparison of cell voltages of CoN-Co2N@NF//CoN-Co2N@NF at 10 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> with previously reported state-of-the-art catalysts for OHzS. d) The amounts of hydrogen theoretically calculated and experimental measured for OHzS. e) *j*–*t* curve of OHzS recorded at an applied cell voltage of 0.22 V for 50 h.

10 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> in the OHzS system (Figure 6b). This value is superior over most of the state-of-the-art catalysts reported for OHzS in alkaline media (Figure 6c and Table S2, Supporting Information). The Faradaic efficiency (96%) for H2 evolution in OHzS (Figure 6d) is close to unit, indicating the high efficiency of the two-electrode setup. In addition, this OHzS system can sustain a current density of 50 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> at an extraordinary low cell voltage of 220 mV with satisfied durability considering the reagent consumption during a 50-h test (Figure 6e).

#### **2.4. Mechanism Investigation**

DFT calculations were conducted to investigate the correlation between catalytic activity and material structure. To account for the structural stability and the superiority of heterostructure, three theoretical models were created: CoN, Co2N, and CoN-Co2N, as shown in **Figure 7**a–c. Figure 7d displays the density of states (DOS) for CoN, Co2N, and CoN-Co2N. CoN-Co2N exhibits a higher DOS near the Fermi level (73.5 eV) compared to CoN (32.4 eV) and Co2N (29.7 eV), indicating that the CoN-Co2N heterostructure possesses higher electronic conductivity. The increased conductivity is beneficial for enhancing electrocatalytic performance. Figure 7e illustrates that the D-band center of the CoN-Co2N heterostructure (Ed) shifts positively from −1.55 eV (CoN) and −1.52 eV (Co2N) to −1.48 eV, bringing it closer to the Fermi level. Notably, the intermediate Co adsorbed sites of CoN and Co2N were positioned near the heterogeneous interface, indicating that the interfacial coupling induces this apparent phase synergy, as shown in Figure 7f. The charge density difference

of heterostructured CoN-Co2N supports this claim. Electrons are found to accumulate in the interface region of CoN-Co2N, significantly altering the electronic structure. The electron redistribution at the interface promotes the synergistic effect of CoN and Co2N phases, enhancing the performance of HER and HzOR.

To gain insight into the high activity of CoN-Co2N@NF heterogeneous assembling body for HER and HzOR, we conducted DFT calculations to analyze the energy barriers of intermediate adsorption. The HER process consists of three states: the initial H<sup>+</sup> and e<sup>−</sup>, the intermediate H adsorption product (H\*), and the final product of 1/2H2. The hydrogen adsorption free energy (Δ*G*H\*) is an important descriptor to evaluate the HER performance of the electrocatalyst, and a promising catalyst should have a moderate Δ*G*H\* (|Δ*G*H\*| = 0).[57] As shown in Figure 7g, CoN-Co2N exhibits a more appropriate Δ*G*H\* (−0.37 eV) for HER compared to Co2N (−0.49 eV) and CoN (−0.62 eV).

Compared to the HER process, there has been relatively less theoretical research on the HzOR process. We performed DFT calculations of N2H4 adsorption (Δ*G*N2H4\*) and stepwise dehydrogenation of N2H4\* to N2 on CoN, Co2N, and CoN-Co2N surfaces after adsorption, as shown in Figure 7h. The results indicate that CoN-Co2N exhibits a more negative Δ*G*N2H4\* of −0.34 eV compared to CoN (−0.24 eV) and Co2N (−0.13 eV), indicating more favorable N2H4 adsorption that is essential for subsequent catalytic oxidation. According to the comparative calculation results of the free hydrogenation steps, the rate-determining step (RDS) is the dehydrogenation from \*N2H3 to \*N2H2 for CoN, Co2N, and CoN-Co2N, where the free energy barrier for CoN-Co2N (0.47 eV) is lower than that for CoN (0.72 eV) and Co2N (0.68 eV). These results indicate that the CoN-Co2N heterostructure optimizes the electronic structure and adsorption energy of reagents/intermediates, promoting the catalytic behaviors of both HER hydrogen sorption and HzOR dehydrogenation.

#### **2.5. Supercapacitive Performances**

The supercapacitive behaviors of as-prepared materials were measured with a three-electrode system in 3 m KOH electrolyte. **Figure 8**a shows CV curves of Co(OH)2@NF, CoN@NF, CoPBA/Co(OH)2@NF, and CoN-Co2N@NF at a scan rate of 5 mV s<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> from 0 to 0.6 V. Among the four materials, the CoN-Co2N@NF exhibits a higher capacitive current response and integrated CV profile area, implying that it has a higher charge

**Figure 8.** Supercapacitive performance of  $Co(OH)_2@NF$ ,  $CoPBA/Co(OH)_2@NF$ , CoN@NF, and  $CoN-Co_2N@NF$  electrodes in 3 M KOH electrolyte with a three-electrode configuration. a) CV curves at 5 mV s<sup>-1</sup>. b) GCD curves at 1 A g<sup>-1</sup>. c) Plots of specific capacity. d) CV profiles of the  $CoN-Co_2N@NF$  at different scan rates. e) EIS curves. f) Cyclic performance and capacity retention of the CoN-Co<sub>2</sub>N@NF over 5000 GCD times at 15 A g<sup>-1</sup>.

storage capacity. Figure 8b shows the galvanostatic chargedischarge (GCD) curves for as-prepared electrodes at 1 A g<sup>-1</sup>, scanned in the range of 0–0.45 V versus Hg/HgO. Compared to the contrast electrodes, the CoN-Co2N@NF shows longer charge and discharge time, consistent with the CV data. The highest areal capacitance achieved was 938 F g<sup>-1</sup> for CoN-Co<sub>2</sub>N@NF at 1 A  $g^{-1}$ , which is much larger than the values for Co(OH)<sub>2</sub>@NF (511 F  $g^{-1}$ ), CoN@NF (503 F  $g^{-1}$ ), and CoPBA/Co(OH)<sub>2</sub>@NF  $(665 \text{ F g}^{-1}).$ 

Typically, the capacitance decreases with increasing current density due to a diffusion effect. However, as shown in Figure 8c, the capacitance of CoN-Co<sub>2</sub>N@NF remained at 86% when the current density was increased from 1 to 10 A g<sup>-1</sup>, signifying remarkable rate capability. Figure 8d shows CV curves for the CoN-

 $Co_2N@NF$  at scan rates from 5 to 100 mV s<sup>-1</sup>. Although the absence of narrow redox peaks and the high degree of symmetry between the charge and discharge portions of each curve suggest a major capacitive mechanism, the CV curve shape is not an ideal rectangle, indicating a charge contribution from a pseudocapacitance mechanism.<sup>[58]</sup> By increasing the scan rate, the redox peaks are gradually separated, while the shape of the CV curve remains unchanged, indicating Faradaic pseudocapacitance behavior, excellent reversibility, and faster charge transfer. [59] Additional GCD and CV data for the above electrodes at diverse current densities are shown in Figures S13 and S14 (Supporting Information), respectively.

The kinetics of as-fabricated electrodes were investigated by EIS measurements, as shown in Figure 8e. The EIS curves

consist of a semicircle at the high frequency, which represents charge transfer resistance (*R*ct), and a diagonal line at the low frequency, which represents the Warburg impedance. The EIS results indicate a pseudocapacitance impedance, and the Warburg resistance of CoN-Co2N@NF is smaller than that of other electrodes, indicating better pseudocapacitance performance.

The cyclic stability of the CoN-Co2N@NF electrode at 15 A g<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> was also evaluated. As shown in Figure 8f, the electrode maintains 95.8% of its initial capacitance after 5000 cycles. The improved capacitive performance of CoN-Co2N@NF can be attributable to its unique 3D-on-1D structure, which not only widens the active contact area but also provides abundant heterojunctions. Moreover, the porous nature of the material facilitates multiple OH<sup>−</sup> and mass transmission channels, further enhancing its electrochemical performance. These findings intuitively demonstrate that the supercapacitive performance of the CoN-Co2N@NF exceeds that of previous reports.[60,61]

## **3. Conclusions**

In summary, we have demonstrated that the CoN-Co2N@NF heterogeneous assembling body, integrated with 1D and 3D nanostructures, possesses excellent electrocatalytic activities toward both hydrogen evolution and hydrazine oxidation. Specifically, the CoN-Co2N@NF exhibits an ultralow onset potential of −0.11 V for HzOR in 1.0 m KOH/0.1 m N2H4 solution. It also exhibits remarkable activity for the HER with a low overpotential of 71 mV for reaching 10 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> in 1.0 m KOH electrolyte. When employed as bifunctional electrocatalysts for overall hydrazine splitting in a two-electrode alkaline system, the CoN-Co2N@NF requires only 53 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2, superior over the state-of-the-art electrocatalysts. The XAS spectroscopy, in situ Raman spectroscopy and DFT calculations identify cobalt nitrides instead of oxides/(oxy)hydroxides as the catalytic species for HzOR and point out advantages of heterostructured CoN-Co2N in optimizing adsorption energies of intermediates/reagents and promoting catalytic activities toward both HzOR and HER. As a supercapacitor electrode, the CoN-Co2N@NF exhibits a specific capacitance of 938 F g<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> at 1 A g<sup>−</sup>1, with remarkable rate capability and cycle stability (95.8% capacity maintained after 5000 cycles). Thus, the work seeks out a fabulous strategy for constructing 1D/3D heterogeneous assembling body of cobalt nitrides for high-performance energy conversion and storage applications.

## **4. Experimental Section**

*Pretreatment of Nickel Foams*: To remove the oxide layer on their surface, the commercial Ni foams (2 cm × 3 cm) were sequentially ultrasonicated in 1 m hydrochloric acid, DI water, and ethanol for 15 min each. Afterward, they were dried overnight in an oven at 60 °C for further use.

*Syntheses of Co(OH)2@NF*: The Co(OH)2@NF NWs were synthesized via a one-pot hydrothermal reaction. In this process, 2 mmol of Co(NO3)2·6H2O, 10 mmol of urea, and 8 mmol of NH4F were dissolved in 35 mL of DI water and sonicated for 5 min to form a clear solution. After the solution was transferred to a 50 mL Teflon autoclave reactor, the cleaned Ni foam was immersed in the solution in an inclined manner, which was kept at 120 °C for 6 h. After cooling to ≈30 °C, the pink Co(OH)2@NF was obtained, and washed with DI water and ethanol for several min, respectively. Finally, the material was dried in an oven at 60 °C overnight.

*Syntheses of CoPBA/Co(OH)2@NF*: The CoPBA/Co(OH)2@NF nanocomposite was synthesized by the following procedure. In a typical experiment, 150 mg K3[CoIII(CN)6] was dissolved in 30 mL DI water in a 50 mL Teflon-lined autoclave, and a piece of Co(OH)2@NF was subsequently immersed into the autoclave and heated at 100 °C for several hours. After cooling down to room temperature, the CoPBA/Co(OH)2@NF was washed with DI water and ethanol and dried at 60 °C overnight. To investigate the morphology evolution, Co(OH)2@NF electrodes were immersed for different durations of 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 6 h.

*Syntheses of CoN-Co2N@NF*: To convert as-obtained CoPBA/Co(OH)2@NF into corresponding metal nitrides, the precursor electrode was placed in a porcelain boat and heated in NH3 atmosphere. The ramp rate was set at 5 °C min<sup>−</sup>1, and the precursor electrode was maintained at 400 °C for 2 h to yield CoN-Co2N@NF. In addition, to investigate the influence of calcination temperature on the nanostructure and catalytic activity, nitridation was also carried out at 300 and 500 °C, while keeping other parameters constant.

*Syntheses of CoN@NF*: CoN@NF was obtained using a similar procedure, except that Co(OH)2@NF was utilized as the precursor.

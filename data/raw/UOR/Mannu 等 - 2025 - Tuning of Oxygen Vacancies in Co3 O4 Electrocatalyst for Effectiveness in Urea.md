**The development of an excellent multifunctional electrocatalyst that is based on non-precious metal is critical for improving the electrochemical processes of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) in alkaline media. This study demonstrates that incorporating Mo into Co3O4 facilitated the formation of rich oxygen vacancies (Vo), which promotes effective nitrate adsorption and activation in urea electrolysis. Subsequently, in situ/operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy is used to explore the active sites in Mo-Co3O4-3 under OER, indicating the oxygen vacancies are first filled with OH• in Mo-Co3O4; facilitated the pre-oxidation of low-valence Co, and promoted the reconstruction/deprotonation of intermediate Co-OOH•. Mo-Co3O4-3 electrocatalysts show impressive HER, OER, and UOR with low overpotentials of 141 mV, 220 mV, and 1.32 V, respectively, at 10 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> in an alkaline medium. Furthermore, in situ/Operando Raman spectroscopy results reveal the importance of CoOOH active sites for enhanced electrochemical performance in Mo-Co3O4-3 compared to the pure Co3O4. The urea electrolyzer with Mo-Co3O4 electrocatalysts acts as an anode and the cathode delivers 1.42 V at 10 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2. A viable approach to creating effective UOR electrocatalysts involves synergistic engineering exploiting doping and oxygen vacancies.**

## **1. Introduction**

The energy crisis is a global concern that has arisen from population growth, industrialization, and modern civilization.[\[1\]](#page-11-0) Hydrogen is a well-known energy carrier with several important properties, including high energy density, high purity, non-toxicity, carbon-free emission, and recyclability.[\[2\]](#page-11-0) Therefore, the renewable and clean hydrogen that is produced by the electrocatalytic water splitting method is favored to replace conventional fossil fuels.[\[3\]](#page-11-0) Among various H2 production methods, water electrolysis is a simple and effective technique with high-capacity density and zero greenhouse gas emissions that provides high-purity H2 and no harmful byproducts.[\[4\]](#page-11-0) Electrocatalytic water splitting typically involves a hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and an oxygen evolution reaction (OER); the latter kinetically hinders the anodic reaction, comprising multiple transfers of electrons.[\[5\]](#page-11-0) Therefore, an alternative anodic reaction with lower potential is required in place of the OER to accelerate

H2 production.[\[6\]](#page-11-0) Among several anodic reactions, the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) requires a low thermodynamic potential of 0.37 V, allowing for the conservation of energy during the electrochemical reaction.[\[7\]](#page-11-0) Additionally, urea is a widely available, costeffective, energetic, and highly stable molecule, which is a distinctive resultant of biological discharges, and industrial and sanitary wastewater.[\[8\]](#page-11-0) Therefore, the oxidation of urea has a twofold application in hydrogen production and wastewater treatment. Consequently, the UOR assists as an effective substitute for the slow anodic OER, to be combined with the cathodic HER in urea electrolysis.[\[9\]](#page-11-0)

Presently, noble metal oxides such as RuO2/IrO2 are considered to be standard catalysts for the OER/UOR but their high cost and scarcity limit their widespread application.[\[10\]](#page-11-0) Recently, non-precious metal-based (such as sulfides,[\[11\]](#page-11-0) oxides,[\[12\]](#page-11-0) phosphides,[[12,13\]](#page-11-0) nitrides,[\[14,15\]](#page-11-0) and selenides[\[16\]](#page-11-0) ) electrocatalysts have been extensively investigated. However, transition metals (Co, Fe, Ni, etc.) are low-cost and abundant, and they have tunable oxidation states, high stability, and activity, enabling them to play an important role in improving electrocatalytic performance.[\[17,18\]](#page-11-0) Specifically, the transition metal-based oxide, cobalt oxide (Co3O4), can have a huge impact on the sluggish OER/UOR due to its superior intrinsic activity, abundance, cost-effectiveness, anti-corrosion properties, and high structural stability.[\[19\]](#page-11-0) Furthermore, Co3O4 contains Co2<sup>+</sup> with three unpaired d electrons and Co3<sup>+</sup> ions with all paired d electrons, leading to a covalent character in the ionic bonds between cobalt and oxygen.[\[20\]](#page-11-0) However, pristine Co3O4 exhibits poor electrical conductivity and few active sites, limiting its otherwise superior catalytic performance.[\[21\]](#page-11-0) Additionally, the feeble adsorption of H2O by Co3O4 and the associated slow kinetics in water dissociation inhibits the formation of hydrogen-free radicals (H\*) and their activity in the HER.[\[22\]](#page-11-0) Moreover, various design strategies have been implemented to enhance electrocatalytic performance. For instance, Li et al. investigated a series of transition metal single-atom embedded in N-doped carbon nanosheets (M-N4/G, where M = Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn). Their study revealed the V-N4/G showed superior sulfur reduction reaction capabilities, attributed to the d-p coupling between V-N4/G and lithium polysulfides.[\[23\]](#page-11-0) In a subsequent study, Li et al. explored dual-atom doping on M/C9N4 (M = Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn) and found that Zn−V/C9N4 demonstrated enhanced electrocatalytic decomposition of lithium polysulfides.[\[24\]](#page-11-0) Additionally, Wen et al. reported the multiphase nanosheets composed of CeO2 nanowires and NiCo-phosphide, where the heterointerface exhibited rich catalytically active sites, resulting in improved performance for both the HER and OER.[\[12\]](#page-11-0)

As stated above, highly active and durable multifunctional electrocatalysts for overall water and urea splitting are sought for the advancement of an operative electrolyzer. Several approaches have been employed to enhance electrocatalytic performance including the exploitation of the morphological effect,[\[25\]](#page-11-0) doping,[\[26\]](#page-11-0) defect structure,[\[27\]](#page-11-0) interface engineering,[\[28\]](#page-11-0) and others.[\[29\]](#page-11-0) Among them, doping with transition metal can relocate the valence electrons and alter the electronic structure of a catalyst, leading to superior catalytic performance.[\[30\]](#page-11-0) Doping with transition metal can relocate the valence electrons and alter the electronic structure of a catalyst, leading to superior catalytic performance.[\[31\]](#page-11-0) Doping with molybdenum (Mo) metal can enhance the electrochemical properties of the catalysts by improving its concentration of free electrons, conductivity, and stability; rearranging valence electrons, and modulating its electronic structure.[\[32\]](#page-11-0) Specifically, the inclusion of Mo can accelerate the electrochemical activity of a catalyst by modifying its crystal structure and generating active sites.[\[33\]](#page-11-0) Additionally, the formation of heterostructures in the catalysts through doping can provide synergistic effects between the different components and facilitate faster electron diffusion, thereby effectively enhancing the catalytic activity.[\[34\]](#page-11-0) Recent studies have reported that introducing oxygen vacancies into the lattice of catalysts is an effective approach to modifying electronic configurations, thereby enhancing OER in alkaline media for Co3O4. [\[35\]](#page-11-0) Available reports also suggest that doping engineering can facilitate the creation of these vacancies, leading to positive outcomes[\[31,32,33\]](#page-11-0) Consequently, incorporating oxygen vacancies into Co3O4 catalysts to modulate hydrogen adsorption capacity presents a promising strategy for improving the HER performance. Furthermore, oxygen vacancies have the potential to alter the surface electronic states of Co3O4, adjusting its adsorption behavior during the OER/HER processes. This modification may result in enhanced OER catalytic activity and electrocatalytic mechanism. Hence, there is a clear need to advance highperformance, multifunctional, non-noble metal catalysts for overall water and urea splitting. Such advancements are crucial for opening the new avenues in water electrolysis technology. Based on the aforementioned details, it is evident that Mo-doped Co3O4 could enhance performance in overall water splitting and urea oxidation.

Various techniques have been employed to fabricate metal oxides and nanostructured materials, including hydrothermal synthesis, chemical reduction, electrochemical deposition, spin coating, and chemical vapor deposition.[\[36\]](#page-11-0) Among these methods, the hydrothermal process stands out for its ability to facilitate crystal growth and self-assembly in an aqueous environment. This approach offers several advantages, including low cost, mild reaction conditions, and ease of process control. The physical and chemical properties of the resulting materials can fine-tuned by adjusting experimental parameters such as pressure, temperature, reaction medium, and duration. These adjustments can influence surface area, particle size, morphology, and structure, ultimately enhancing the overall electrochemical performance of the material.[\[37\]](#page-11-0) Based on the aforementioned facts, Co3O4 and Mo-doped Co3O4 electrocatalysts are synthesized using a hydrothermal process for use in electrocatalytic water oxidation. The as-prepared heterostructure samples with different weight percentages on Mo were denoted as Mo-Co3O4 -1 (Mo-5% (0.009 M), Mo-Co3O4 -2 (Mo-10% (0.0125 M), and Mo-Co3O4 -3 (Mo-15% (0.0225 M)). The optimized catalyst (Mo-Co3O4-3) exhibited excellent OER/HER catalytic performance in an alkaline medium due to its rich oxygen vacancies (Vo), favoring nitrate adsorption and activation in urea electrolysis. Furthermore, the Mo-Co3O4- 3 sample exhibits rapid kinetics, low charge transfer resistance, high activity, and exceptional durability. A urea electrolyzer that uses Mo-Co3O4-3 electrocatalyst acts as the anode and the cathode delivers 1.42 V at 10 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2. Further, in situ/o*perando* Raman and EXAFS results provide evidence of the surface dynamic evolution process of defective electrocatalysts and identify the active sites during the electrocatalytic process.

## **2. Results and Discussion**

#### **2.1. Structural Characterization of the Active Catalysts**

**Figure [1](#page-2-0)**a represents a schematic illustration of the fabrication method of pure Co3O4, Mo-Co3O4-1, Mo-Co3O4-2, and Mo-Co3O4-3 electrocatalysts. The microstructures and morphologies of the prepared catalysts were examined using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM). The FESEM image shows that a flower-like nanostructure was formed by layering a bundle of Co3O4 nanoneedles over a bud (Figure [1b,c\)](#page-2-0). The nanoneedles (Figure [1d–g\)](#page-2-0) were completely converted to nanoflakes in 15% Mo-containing Co3O4, as observed in Figure [1h,i.](#page-2-0) As shown in Figure [1j,](#page-2-0) the HRTEM image reveals the Mo-Co3O4-3 catalysts in the form of nanoflakes were assembled with a spherical structure. The lattice fringes with interplanar spacings of 0.29 nm and 0.2 nm corresponded to the (311) and (111) planes of Co3O4, respectively (Figure [1k1,k2\)](#page-2-0).[\[38\]](#page-11-0) The 16136829, 2025, 4, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smll.202403744 by University Of Science, Wiley Online Library on [06/01/2026].

energy-dispersive spectroscope (EDS) elemental mapping images confirm the uniform distributions of Mo, Co, and O in the Mo-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-3 catalysts (Figure 11).

The crystal structures and phases of Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> and Mo-doped Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> were confirmed using X-ray diffraction spectroscopy (XRD). As shown in Figure 2a, the diffraction pattern of  $Co_3O_4$  included peaks at 19°, 31.37°, 36.94°, 38.68°, 44.86°, 55.75°, 59.49°, and 65.36°, which are indexed to the (111), (220), (311), (222), (400), (422), (511), and (440) planes of the spinel cubic structure, respectively.[39,40] The XPS survey spectra confirm the presence of Mo, Co, and O elements in Mo-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-3 electrocatalysts (Figure S1a, Supporting Information). As shown in Figure 2b, the high-resolution Co 2p spectrum exhibits four peaks at 779.88, 781.57, 794.74, and 796.53 eV, which correspond to  $Co^{3+}$  ( $2p_{3/2}$ ),  $Co^{2+}$   $(2p_{3/2})$ ,  $Co^{3+}$   $(2p_{1/2})$ , and  $Co^{2+}$   $(2p_{1/2})$ , respectively, [41] and two satellite peaks were observed at 789.55 and 804.51 eV. The binding energies of Mo-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> were shifted toward higher energy  $(\Delta = 0.33 \text{ eV})$  and doping with Mo modified the electronic structure of Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, improving the electrocatalytic performance.<sup>[42]</sup> The  $Co^{3+}/Co^{2+}$  ratio of Mo-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-3 (1.29) exceeded that of pristine Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (0.55), indicating that more Co<sup>3+</sup> species were exposed on the surface of the Mo-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-3 catalyst, potentially providing active sites for electrocatalytic activity. [43] In Figure 2c, the binding energies of 231.95 and 235.18 eV were ascribed to the Mo  $3d_{5/2}$  and Mo  $3d_{3/2}$  orbitals of Mo<sup>6+</sup>, respectively.<sup>[44]</sup> The signals of Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> and Mo-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> in the O 1s spectra (Figure 2d) can be deconvoluted into three peaks - 529.87 eV (M-O), 531.18 eV (Ov), and 532.51 eV (chemisorbed oxygen). [45] The Ov peak from Mo-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-3 is significantly more intense than that from pristine Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, and the peak percentage ratio (Vo/M-O) of Mo-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-3

(0.75) is much higher than that of pristine Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (0.66) (Table S1, Supporting Information), revealing that Mo induced the propagation of oxygen vacancies. [46] The binding energy of the Mo-doped Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> was shifted upward, suggesting that the charge transfer that was caused by oxygen vacancies considerably altered the electronic structure of Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>.[47]

To further examine the formation of oxygen vacancies among the prepared catalysts, the electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy was employed. As displayed in Figure S1b, Supporting Information, the ESR response in these materials is primarily attributed to oxygen vacancies with unpaired electrons. The Mo-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-3 sample exhibits a higher intensity with the g-factor of 2.003 compared to other samples, indicating a greater concentration of oxygen vacancies resulting from Mo doping into Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>. [48] Moreover, the ESR spectrum of Mo-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-3 displays a marked increase in signal intensity. This variation in signal intensity further corroborated the difference in oxygen vacancy concentration, which is consistent with the XPS results.

#### 2.2. X-Ray Absorption Spectroscopic Studies

X-ray absorption near edge structures (XANES) and extended Xray absorption fine structures (EXAFS) are highly sensitive to the local electronic and geometric structures, making them effective tools for determining the active species in the catalysts.<sup>[49]</sup> A weak pre-edge peak is detected for both Mo-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-1 and Mo-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-3 catalysts (Figure 3a) and the absorption edge was similar to that of the MoO<sub>3</sub> standard reference, revealing the presence of octahedral geometry of Mo<sup>6+</sup> species with Mo in the

oxidation state 6+. [\[50–52\]](#page-11-0) The Fourier transform FT-EXAFS spectra (Figure 3b) at the Mo K-edge show two predominant coordination peaks at 1.29 Å and 2.98 Å, which correspond to the Mo-O and Mo-Mo bonds in Mo-Co3O4-1, respectively. The noticeable downshift in the lengths Mo-O bond and Mo-Mo bond in Mo-Co3O4-3 compared to those in Mo-Co3O4-1 indicates the presence of more cationic (molybdenum/cobalt) vacancies. Further, Figure S3a, Supporting Information shows similar EXAFS oscillations for all Mo-Co3O4-1 and Mo-Co3O4-3 catalysts and is comparable to the MoO3, indicating the local coordination geometries around the Mo sites.

To determine the valence state of Co, Co K-edge XANES spectra were obtained. The pre-edge peak feature of the Co K-edge of both Mo-Co3O4-1 and Mo-Co3O4-3 is similar to that of Co3O4, suggesting an average valence state of Co2<sup>+</sup>/Co3<sup>+</sup> (Figure 3c). From the Co K-edge XANES spectra, the absorption edge position of Mo-Co3O4-3 was slightly shifted to higher energy compared to that of Mo-Co3O4-1, revealing a more positive oxidation state of Co (LS Co3<sup>+</sup>) in Mo-Co3O4-3.[\[53,54\]](#page-11-0) The Co R-space FT-EXAFS spectra of Mo-Co3O4-1 show two distinct peaks at ∼1.50 and ∼2.50 Å, which are assigned to the Co-O and Co-Co coordination, respectively (Figure 3d). Notably, the bond lengths of Co-O reduced from 1.50 to 1.47 Å in the Mo-Co3O4-3 electrocatalyst specify the presence of more oxygen/cationic vacancies.[\[55\]](#page-11-0) Figure S3b, Supporting Information shows similar EXAFS oscillations for all of the catalysts, however, a reduction in the oscillation amplitude in Mo-Co3O4-3 indicates the presence of more disordered octahedrons.

edge shifts to higher energy at 1.45 V compared to those in Mo-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-3 at the OCP or an applied potential of 1.35 V, demonstrating an increase in the Co valence state. The analysis of the Co K-edge EXAFS fitting results further evidence that the coordination number (CN) of Co-O (3.89) was higher at the applied potential at 1.45 V compared to the CN of Co-O (3.58) at the open circuit potential (OCP) or 1.25 V (3.66), as shown in Figure S6

potential at 1.45 V compared to the CN of Co-O (3.58) at the open circuit potential (OCP) or 1.25 V (3.66), as shown in Figure S6 and Table S2, Supporting Information. This change in the CN of Co-O at a higher potential could be due to the oxygen vacancies. The oxygen vacancies and metal vacancies seemingly coexisted, as evidenced by the observed variation in coordination number for the Co-O first shell with an applied voltage, which also exhibits a similar trend for the Co-Co second shell. Therefore, Co sites are assumed to be the most active sites among these elements, since the measured results suggest an extensive change in the CN of Co-O. Cobalt tends to change the local structural rearrangement and sustain the spinel structure in the existence of

oxygen or metal vacancies.[20,59]

An increase in Co valence is assumed to originate from the deprotonation process on the reconstructed surface of the catalysts.<sup>[60]</sup> Once the anode potential increases and the surface charge cannot oxidize Co (IV) to a higher valence state, electrons are removed from the surface oxygen, causing an escape of oxygen that is accompanied by structural reconstruction.<sup>[61]</sup> Li et al., reported that due to the stronger attraction of the Co sites for the  $O_{2n}$  electrons at a high anode potential, the deprotonation reaction of the medium OH-(M-OH\*) proceeds reasonably easily. [62] Subsequently, owing to the improved electrophilicity of the exposed cobalt sites, Vo is expected to promote the adsorption of the OH ions on the active Co sites to form adsorbed M-OH\* species and subsequently prompt the deprotonation process at a low potential (1.45 V) to form active oxygen species (Co-OOH\*) on the surface, accounting for the enhanced OER activity.[62-65] Therefore, the surface interaction of V<sub>O</sub> in Mo-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-3 is more easily changed by reconstruction from the oxide into Co-OOH\* intermediate species. [66,67] The Co-OOH is generally considered the most active species in many Co-based oxide catalysts for the OER. [68] Moreover, the V<sub>O</sub> would promote surface reconstruction and thereby the development of active oxyhydroxide.

Figure S6, Supporting Information presents the fitting results of Co K-edge k<sup>3</sup>-weighted EXAFS analysis and the FT-EXAFS spectra for Mo-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-3 to obtain quantitative information about the structural parameters around Co atoms (Figure S5, Supporting Information). The first peak at ~1.50 Å corresponds to single scattering paths of the Co-O bonds. Another two peaks ~2.50 and  $\sim 3.10$  Å are associated with the radial distances of  $Co_{Oh}$  (Co at octahedral sites) and Co<sub>Td</sub> (Co at tetrahedral sites) to their neighboring metal atoms, respectively (Figure 3f). Figure S7, Supporting Information presents changes in various local coordination environments around cobalt sites in a crystal structure during the OER process. The coordination number (CN) of Co-O for Mo-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-3 increases significantly upon immersion in the electrolyte at 1.25 V and increases further with the applied electrode potential (Figure S7 and Table S2, Supporting Information). The largest CN was found at the onset of the OER at 1.45 V. Results concerning the CN reveal the important role of oxygen vacancies in cobalt pre-oxidation and structural reconstruction in the OER process. In light of the XPS and XANES results, given the regulation of the surface electronic structures of the catalysts by oxygen

Furthermore, Figure S4a, Supporting Information presents the Mo  $M_{3,2}$ -edge ( $M_3$  ( $3p_{3/2}$ ) and  $M_2$  ( $3p_{1/2}$ )) XAS spectra of MoCo<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-1 and Mo-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-3. The peak position and shape of these samples' Mo 3p XAS spectra are very similar. The obtained Mo 3p XAS spectra of Mo-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-1 and Mo-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-3 are consistent with the earlier report and similar to that of MoO<sub>3</sub>, which reveals a double-peak structure for  $M_3$  ( $3p^{3/2}$ )-edge. The key difference between hexavalent (Mo<sup>6+</sup>) and tetravalent (Mo<sup>4+</sup>) is in their line shapes: the Mo 3p XAS spectrum of hexavalent MoO<sub>3</sub> exhibits a double-peak structure, while that of tetravalent MoO<sub>2</sub> exhibits a single, broad structure. Therefore, the Mo ions are expected to be hexavalent (Mo<sup>6+</sup>) with the configuration of  $4d^0$  ( $t_{2g}^0$ ). The Mo-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-3 catalyst exhibits higher absorption intensity than the Mo-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-1 catalyst, further confirming the higher Mo<sup>6+</sup> content

Figure S4b, Supporting Information displays the Co L-edge spectra of the Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, Mo-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-1, and Mo-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-3 catalysts. Generally, transition-metal L<sub>3,2</sub>-edge spectra strongly depend on the multiplet structure, local crystal fields, and the hybridization with O 2p ligands; they are therefore very sensitive to electronic structure and spin state. As a result of orbital splitting, the Co L-edge spectra include L<sub>3</sub> and L<sub>2</sub> regions ~780 and 795 eV, respectively. Notably, the absorption peaks at ~779.10 and ~780.80 eV correspond to the high spin (HS) Co<sup>2+</sup> and low spin (LS) Co<sup>3+</sup> states, respectively.<sup>[56]</sup> A small peak ~783.00 eV is associated with metal-to-ligand charge transfer. Even though all the samples have mixed HS Co2+ and LS Co3+ states, the relative intensity of the peak at ~780.10 eV for Mo-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-3 is higher than that for Mo-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-1 (Figure S4b, Supporting Information), signifying the dominance of the LS Co<sup>3+</sup> state, which is consistent with the earlier reports on  $\text{Co}_3\text{O}_4.^{[53,54]}$  Furthermore, the deconvoluted Co-L<sub>3</sub> edge spectra show two dominant features: a and b for the Mo-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-1 and  $a_1$  and  $b_1$  for the Mo-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-3, as shown in Figure S4c,d, Supporting Information. Features a and b are associated with the LS Co<sup>3+</sup> ( $t_{2g}^{5}e_{g}^{0}$ ) and HS Co<sup>2+</sup> ( $t_{2g}^{4}e_{g}^{2}$ ) states in octahedral coordination.<sup>[54,57,58]</sup> However, a higher  $a_{1}/b_{1}$  was observed in Mo-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-3 than in Mo-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-1, revealing the presence of more  $Co^{3+}$ . Similarly, the high intensity of feature  $b_1$  in Mo-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-3 demonstrated the dominance of the high-valent LS  $Co^{3+}$  state  $(t_{2\sigma}^{5}e_{\sigma}^{0})$  (Figure S4b, Supporting Information). The efficient OER of the Mo-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-3 catalyst was consistent with the supremacy of the octahedrally coordinated  $\mathrm{Co^{3+}}$  states.

#### 2.3. In Situ XAS Analysis in OER Reaction

To determine the catalytic activity of the Co, the in situ XANES and EXAFS spectra of the Co K edge for Mo-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-3 catalyst were obtained. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed to record the pre-oxidation process to understand the catalytic kinetics of the OER on Mo-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-3 (Figure S2, Supporting Information). Figure 3e,f and Figure S5, Supporting Information display the in situ XANES and FT-EXAFS spectra of the Co K edge at different applied potentials. The absorption edge and main absorption peak position at the Co K edge are considerably shifted upward as the applied voltage is increased from the open circuit potential (OCP) to 1.65 V, suggesting an increase in the oxidation state of Co under the OER environment (Figure 3e). Notably, the Co ions in Mo-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-3 undergo faster oxidation as the absorption

vacancies, the cobalt sites in defective cobalt oxides (Mo-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>) more effectively adsorb oxygen species (OH\*) and are easily oxidized and reconstructed. As the applied potential increases to 1.55 V, the CN of the Mo-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-3 begins to decrease. This phenomenon probably influences the evolution of oxygen species (M-OOH\*), in which the electrons are removed from the surface M-OOH\* to remove protons, causing oxygen to escape. Consequently, because of the regulation of surface Co sites by oxygen vacancies, Mo-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-3 requires a lower potential to achieve deprotonation and oxygen evolution.

The CN of the tetrahedral-related cobalt sites (Co-Co<sub>Td</sub>) in the Mo-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-3 (Figure S7c, Supporting Information) increased sharply during OER pre-oxidation (from OCP to 1.25 V), consistent with the change of the CN of Co-O, indicating the rapid filling of oxygen species (OH\*) and the oxidation of Co sites. Therefore, the defect-regulated Mo-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-3 correlated more to the oxygen tetrahedrally coordinated with cobalt. In conclusion, the oxygen vacancies significantly influence the formation of surface Co-OOH before and during the OER process, enhancing OER activity. [69] Xiao et al., Peng et al., and Li et al. reported the theoretical calculations of the effect of oxygen vacancies to suggest that oxygen defects would reduce the band gap, increase the Fermi and HOMO levels of the metal (hydro)oxide (MO or MOOH), and promote the continuation of the reaction by increasing the binding strength of O<sup>o</sup> and OOH<sup>o</sup> intermediates.<sup>[68,70,71]</sup> To further explain the reconstruction of the Mo-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-3 with/without oxygen vacancies during the OER process, the reaction mechanism was proposed based on the above operando results to understand the structural evolution and simulate the OER process.<sup>[72]</sup> The unique influence of V<sub>O</sub> on the surface of Mo-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-3 is proposed to regulate the adsorption energy of OH<sup>-</sup> at Co sites and act as a significant intermediary for OOH transfer, thereby catalyzing the OER on Mo-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>.<sup>[73]</sup> The oxygen defects on Mo-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-3 were more readily filled with OH\*, facilitating the preoxidation of Co sites and the reconstruction/deprotonation of intermediaries (M-OOH\*), as shown in Figure S14a,b, Supporting

Electrochemical in situ Raman spectroscopy was performed to explore the dynamics of structural reconstruction during the OER process and elucidate its mechanism. Raman spectra of fresh catalysts were recorded under successively increasing potential from 1.25 to 1.65 V (versus RHE) with a 0.10 V step (Figure 3g,h). In the dray state (pristine-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>) in Figure 3g, the Raman bands at ~482, ~526, and ~684 cm<sup>-1</sup> are assigned to the  $E_{2\sigma}$ ,  $F_{2\sigma}$ , and  $A_{1\sigma}$  phonon modes of typically structured  $Co_3O_4$ , respectively. The band at  $\sim$ 684 cm<sup>-1</sup> corresponds to A<sub>1g</sub> of octahedral sites (CoO<sub>6</sub>), associated with Co<sup>3+</sup>–O<sup>2-</sup> Raman vibration, which was used to monitor the evolution of trivalent octahedral sites of Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> during OER. No obvious impurity phase was detected during OER. The sample is immersed in 1M KOH for 15 min (OCP) to understand the effect of solvation on the structural reconstruction on the Mo-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-3 catalyst surface. As seen in Figure 3g, the sample undergoes surface restructuring upon immersion in the electrolyte solution without applied potential bias, indicating that the as-prepared sample acts as a precatalyst in this reaction. The Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (E<sub>2g</sub>, F<sub>2g</sub>) peaks transform into the CoOOH (Eg) peaks when Mo-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-3 is dipped in 1M KOH solution under OCP condition. The band at ~685 cm<sup>-1</sup> (Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>) becomes less intense, while the sharp band at 505 cm<sup>-1</sup>, characteristic of CoOOH formation, starts to evolve. [75,76] This indicates that the surface is reconstructed from spinal Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> to the oxyhydroxide (Co<sup>3+</sup>) structure.

Concurrently, a band at 684 cm<sup>-1</sup> exhibits a blue-shift with reduced intensity compared to the pristine sample. The evolution of a minor amount of surface spinel phase upon immersion in 1 м KOH should be considered. The absence of a sharp peak ~420 cm<sup>-1</sup>, typically originating from the A<sub>1g</sub> vibration mode of Co(OH)2, indicates that the Co(OH)2 phase remains undetected.<sup>[75]</sup> At an applied potential of 1.25 V, the band at ~505  $cm^{-1}$  (E<sub>g</sub>) intensifies while the peak intensity of A<sub>1g</sub> diminishes. Further increasing in the potential to 1.35 V leads to the formation of additional bands at ~470 and ~572 cm<sup>-1</sup>, attributed to  $CoO_2$  (E<sub>g</sub>) and  $CoO_2$  (A<sub>10</sub>), respectively. These bands, predicted to correspond to CoO<sub>2</sub>, continue to evolve from 1.35 to 1.65 V.<sup>[76]</sup> At an applied potential of 1.45 V, the peak intensity of the  $\sim$ 470 cm<sup>-1</sup> band becomes more pronounced, while the intensity of E<sub>g</sub> (CoOOH) decreases. Simultaneously, the A<sub>1g</sub> peak intensity decreases and exhibits a significant blue shift from ~694 to ~697 cm<sup>-1</sup> compared to the OCP condition after 15 min. Notably, at an applied potential of 1.55 V, the intensities of both CoO<sub>2</sub> (E<sub>o</sub>) and CoO<sub>2</sub> (A<sub>1g</sub>) peaks become more pronounced, while the Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>  $(A_{1g})$  peaks further decrease in intensity.

The observed transformation of Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> with increasing applied potential under an alkaline medium largely aligns with electrochemical thermodynamic theory. [77,78] These analytical results suggest that CoO<sub>2</sub>, along with CoOOH, serve as the active sites of pure Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> for the OER. On the other hand, for the Mo-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-3, the CoO<sub>2</sub> species were not detected in the in situ/operando Raman spectrum (Figure 3h). Under OER conditions, the Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (A<sub>10</sub>) peak was observed along with the CoOOH (E<sub>o</sub>) peak for the Mo-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-3 catalyst. This observation suggests that CoOOH is the most stable phase of Mo-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-3 in an alkaline solution. Even as the applied potential increased to 1.65 V for Mo-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-3 sample, only the CoOOH peak was detected, demonstrating that CoOOH acts as the primary active site for high OER activity by serving as a fast-active site. [64,79] Consequently, CoOOH (E<sub>o</sub>) is proposed to be the main active intermediate for the OER in Mo-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-3. The  $E_g$  (CoOOH) peak is more pronounced with applied bias in the Mo-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-3 sample compared to pristine Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (where the CoO<sub>2</sub> peak is more prominent and CoOOH less pronounced with applied bias up to 1.65V). This difference highlights the significance of CoOOH (fast active sites) for enhanced OER activity in Mo-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-3. It is well established that oxyhydroxide species are anticipated to be the intermediate active phase for OER. This discrepancy could also explain the lower activity of spinel structures in catalyzing OER compared to  $Mo-Co_3O_4-3$ .

Similar to the pristine Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> sample, a band at ~686 cm<sup>-1</sup> in Mo-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-3 exhibits a blue shift with increasing applied bias up to 1.65 V versus RHE, accompanied by asymmetric broadening. This observation provides insight into surface modification close to the OER onset potential, as evidenced by changes in the  $A_{1\sigma}$  band position and peak shape ~680–697 cm<sup>-1</sup>, corresponding to the Co<sup>3+</sup>-O vibration mode in the octahedral sites of spinel structure. As displayed in Figure 3h, the  $A_{\rm 1g}$  band exhibits asymmetric broadening and can be attributed to decreased crystallinity of the material. This effect may result from the randomizing influence of oxygen vacancies, the formation of

amorphous surface species, or surface bond contraction in the asformed distorted spinel phase. Additionally, blue shifts in Raman bands specify the lattice distortion due to bond compression and charge redistribution.<sup>[80]</sup> Considering the proposed mechanism (Figure S14, Supporting Information), the in situ Raman results suggest that Mo-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-3 catalyst undergoes surface reconstruction during the OER process. The influence of  $V_{\Omega}$  on the surface of Mo-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-3 is proposed to regulate the adsorption energy of OH- at Co sites and act as a significant intermediary for OOH. transfer, thereby catalyzing the OER.<sup>[73]</sup> The oxygen defects on Mo-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-3 were more readily filled with OH•, facilitating the pre-oxidation of Co sites and the reconstruction/deprotonation of intermediaries (M-OOH\*), as shown in Figure \$14a,b, Supporting Information. Moreover, oxygen defects or vacancies are expected to play a major role in enhanced OER activity of Mo-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-3, which is consistent with ESR and XPS analyses.

The possibility of generating Co<sup>4+</sup> intermediates in Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> for Mo-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-3 cannot be excluded, despite their potential undetectability due to limitations in the sensitivity of in situ/operando Raman spectroscopy. Such transformation may occur only in specific atomic layers, potentially eluding detection. The observed pronounced phase transition from Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> to CoOOH in the present work aligns with observations by Yeo et al. on cobalt oxides-based materials. [67,81] The in situ/operando Raman spectroscopy results are consistent with the in situ XANES observations. As shown in Figure 3e, the in situ/operando XANES absorption peak position of Mo-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-3 exhibits a positive shift as the applied potential increases up to 1.65 V (versus RHE). This shift toward higher energy indicates a phase transition of Co at the surface, confirming that the Mo-doped Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> maintains a stable phase (CoOOH) under OER condition. The combined in situ/operando XAS and Raman results corroborate the proposed OER reaction mechanism in this work, elucidating the structural evolution and simulating the OER process (Figure S14, Supporting Information).

Based on previously reported density functional theory (DFT) simulations on  $V_O$ -Mo $_x$ Co $_{3-x}O_4$ , the adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM) and oxide path mechanism (OPM) have been proposed for the OER.[35] Considering the analytical results in this work, we propose reaction thermodynamics and explore the dynamics of structural reconstruction during the OER process to elucidate the mechanism for Mo-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-3, given its similarity to the previous report. The AEM pathway is expected to be more prevalent than the OPM in our prepared Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> and Mo-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-3 catalysts. Generally, the OER process on the surface of electrocatalysts via the AEM pathway involves the adsorption and transformation of three key reaction intermediates: \*OH, \*O, and \*OOH, as depicted in Figure \$14a, Supporting Information. The Gibbs free energy diagrams of the OER through the AEM pathway reveal that Mo-doped Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> is expected to have a lower free energy compared to that of pure Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, suggesting enhanced activity via the AEM. The transformation of \*O into \*OOH is suggested to be the potential determining step (PDS), according to the scaling relationship.[82]

To gain further insight into the electronic structure modification of Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> and Mo-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-3, the density of states (DOS) and band centers of Co 3d and O 2p orbitals were inferred from available reports. Below the Fermi level, a downward shift in the Co

3d band and an upward shift in the O 2p band are expected when compared with Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, suggesting a more significant overlap of Co 3d and O 2p orbitals.[83] This modification is likely to reinforce the metal-oxygen bonds in the lattice, consequently dipping the possibility of the lattice-oxygen-mediated mechanism (LOM) occurring on the surface of Mo-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-3.<sup>[84]</sup> The downward shift of the Co 3d band is posited to promote the hybridization of its Co 3d-t2g orbitals with unbounded O 2p orbitals, facilitating the adsorption of hydroxyl groups and their subsequent deprotonation to form \*O.[85] Furthermore, owing to the appropriate distance between the closest octahedral Co atoms in Mo-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-3, neighboring adsorbed oxygen species tend to directly couple for the formation of O-O radicals.[86] The introduction of oxygen vacancies by doping Mo appears to favorably shift the thermodynamic equilibrium of the OER and decreases the free energy increase of the PDS, ultimately lowering the overpotential of the OER process. This electronic structure modification provides a mechanistic explanation for the enhanced catalytic activity of Mo-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-3 compared to pristine Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>.

#### 2.4. Electrocatalytic Performance

The catalytic performance of prepared materials was investigated in a standard three-electrode system in 1 m KOH. Figure 4 plots the linear scanning voltammetry (LSV) polarization curve of prepared materials and commercial Pt/C catalysts with a scan rate of 5 mV s<sup>-1</sup>. As shown in Figure 4a, the LSV polarization curve of HER using Mo-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-3 electrocatalysts required an overpotential of 141 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, which is lower than  $Co_3O_4$  (321 mV), Mo- $Co_3O_4$ -1 (230 mV), and Mo-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-2 (191 mV). The Tafel slope of Mo-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-3 (102 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>) was lower than those of catalysts Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (128 mV  $dec^{-1}$ ), Mo-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-1 (137 mV  $dec^{-1}$ ), and Mo-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-2 (154 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>), indicating the faster reaction kinetics with Mo-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-3 catalysts (Figure 4b). The chronopotentiometry test for HER demonstrates that Mo-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-3 catalysts exhibit good stability over 55 h at -10 mA (Figure 4c). Furthermore, the LSV curve of Mo-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-3 (after the stability test (55 h)) reveals that the HER activity had only marginally declined (Figure S8, Supporting Information).

The catalytic performance of Mo-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> in the OER was measured under the same conditions. As displayed in Figure 4d, Mo-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-3 catalysts exhibited an overpotential of 220 mV at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, which was lower than those of Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (490 mV), Mo-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-1 (230 mV), Mo-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-2 (290 mV), and RuO<sub>2</sub> (260 mV). Generally, pure Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> catalysts undergo significant chargeaccumulation surface reconstruction (Co<sup>III</sup>Co<sup>IV</sup> ↔ Co<sup>IV</sup>Co<sup>IV</sup>) at  $\approx$ 1.60 V, around the onset potential for OER. The Co<sup>IV</sup> species produced during this process are stabilized and do not participate in rapid OER turnover, suggesting that this peak is associated with a surface capacitive process.<sup>[87]</sup> Therefore, this redox feature of Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> corresponds to a 2 e<sup>-</sup>/3 H<sup>+</sup> surface capacitive process of  $Co^{III}Co^{IV} \leftrightarrow {}^{IV}Co^{IV}$ , consistent with the reported structural modifications.  $^{[79]}$  Moreover, this prominent 2  $e^-/3$   $H^+$  redox feature of Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> indicates that the dimeric Co<sup>IV</sup>Co<sup>IV</sup> intermediate is relatively stabilized and consequently cannot undergo the rapid catalytic turnover process to generate O2 and return to the lower valence resting states, [88] therefore resulting in an increased

overpotential to drive the catalytic reaction. [89] Furthermore, the Tafel slope of Mo-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-3 (108 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>) catalysts was smaller than those of Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (153 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>), Mo-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-1 (140 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>), Mo-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-2 (130 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>), showing faster OER kinetics (Figure 4e). As illustrated in Figure 4f, Mo-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-3 maintains a nearly constant potential at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> during a 55h durability test. Furthermore, the LSV curve of after stability result revealed negligible changes in overpotential after 55 h (Figure S9, Supporting Information. As illustrated in Figure 4g,h and Figure S10, Supporting Information, Mo-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-3 exhibited a higher doublelayer capacitance (C<sub>dl</sub>) of 2.59 mF cm<sup>-2</sup> and electrochemical surface area (ECSA) of 64.72 cm $^{-2}$  than those of Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (1.12 mF cm<sup>-2</sup> and 28.01 cm<sup>-2</sup>), Mo-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-1 (1.18 mF cm<sup>-2</sup> and 47.03 cm<sup>-2</sup>), and Mo-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-1 (2.43 mF cm<sup>-2</sup> and 60.75 cm<sup>-2</sup>). As displayed in Figure 4i, the charge transfer resistance (Rct) of Mo- $Co_3O_4$ -3 is 36.4  $\Omega$  cm<sup>-2</sup>, which is lower than those of  $Co_3O_4$  (96.8  $\Omega$  cm<sup>-2</sup>), Mo-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-1 (56.8  $\Omega$  cm<sup>-2</sup>), and Mo-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-2 (52.9  $\Omega$ cm<sup>-2</sup>), demonstrating the improved charge transfer rate in Mo-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> catalysts.<sup>[7,90]</sup>

To understand the changes in the morphology and surface electronic states of the Mo-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-3 electrocatalyst, FESEM, and XPS were used after a stability test in the alkaline medium. The post-OER FESEM image of Mo-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-3 shows the flake-like structure after a 55-h stability test (Figure S11, Supporting Information). The XPS full survey spectra also disclose the retention of Co, O, and Mo elements in Mo-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-3 electrocatalysts (after the stability test) and the generation of no new phase (Figure S12a, Supporting Information). As shown in Figure S12b, Supporting Information, the binding energies of Co 2p shifted downward and the Co<sup>3+</sup>/Co<sup>2+</sup> ratio increased, suggesting that the solubility and oxidation of Co may have contributed to the decline in the OER performance.<sup>[91,92]</sup> Moreover, the intensity of the Mo 3d peaks declined slightly after the stability test (Figure S12c, Supporting Information). As displayed in Figure S12d, Supporting Information, a decrease in the height of the Ov peak is accompanied by opposite changes in the intensities of the lattice oxygen and hydroxyl oxygen peaks, possibly due to interface effects of the catalysts.

#### 2.5. UOR Electrolysis

Figure 5a plots the LSV polarization curve of Mo-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-3 with 0.3 м urea + 1 м KOH and 1 M KOH alone. The LSV curve of the Mo-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-3 catalyst demonstrates that the potential was reduced from 1.45 V for 1 M KOH alone to 1.32 V for 0.3 M urea + 1 M KOH. Furthermore, the UOR potentials of Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, Mo-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-1, and Mo-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-2 were 1.51, 1.41, and 1.37 V, respectively at a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> (Figure 5b,c). The excellent electrocatalytic performance of Mo-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-3 was compared with Cobased materials (Table S3, Supporting Information). As shown in Figure 5d, the  $R_{ct}$  value of Mo-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-3 (2.18  $\Omega$  cm<sup>-2</sup>) is smaller than  $Co_3O_4$  (4.3  $\Omega$  cm<sup>-2</sup>), Mo- $Co_3O_4$ -1 (3.84  $\Omega$  cm<sup>-2</sup>), and Mo- $\text{Co}_3\text{O}_4$ -2 (2.35  $\Omega$  cm<sup>-2</sup>). Furthermore, a chronopotentiometry test for UOR revealed that the Mo-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-3 catalyst retained its full activity over 55 h (Figure 5e). Additionally, the small potential variation (0.05 V) between the LSV curves of fresh Mo-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-3 and that after the stability test demonstrates its good long-term durability (Figure 5f).

## 2.6. Overall Water Splitting and Urea Electrolysis

The remarkable HER, OER, and UOR electrocatalytic activities of the Mo-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-3 catalyst have encouraged a study of its possible electrocatalytic activity in the processes of urea electrolysis and water splitting. As displayed in **Figure 6a** and S13, Supporting Information (digital photograph of two-electrode configuration for HER//UOR electrolyzer), the cathode and anode in this configuration are constructed of Mo-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-3 catalysts. The polarization cure of urea electrolysis (1.42 V) required a lower potential than water electrolysis (1.53 V) at a current density of 10 mA

cm<sup>-2</sup> (Figure 6b). The long-term stability of the catalyst in electrochemical total water splitting was also evaluated and presented in Figure 6c. The catalyst's exceptional stability for electrochemical total water-splitting is confirmed using the fabricated Mo-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-3// Mo-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-3 electrode, which exhibited almost no change in potential even after 24 h of continuous operation. The Mo-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-3 catalyst demonstrated excellent catalytic performance as an UOR electrocatalyst, exhibiting high efficiency and durability. Its performance surpassed that of some recently reported Cobased electrocatalysts (Figure 6d and Table S4, Supporting Information). The mechanistic understanding of urea decomposition during the oxidation process has been elucidated by density functional theory (DFT), as proposed by Daramola et al.[93] Three probable pathways are identified, all sharing identical initial steps of urea molecule adsorption and final steps of CO<sub>2</sub> desorption. Among these pathways, CO<sub>2</sub> desorption from the active site surface was identified as the rate-determining step due to its large free energy change. Based on these insights, [93] it is suggested that the Mo-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-3 catalyst follows a similar mechanism, producing CO<sub>2</sub> and potentially other value-added products during the UOR process.

#### 3. Conclusion

In summary, the prepared Mo-Co $_3$ O $_4$ -3 electrocatalyst exhibited excellent multifunctional electrocatalytic performance with required overpotentials of 141 and 220 mV for the HER and the OER, respectively, at a current density of 10 mA cm $^{-2}$  in an alkaline medium. The Mo-Co $_3$ O $_4$ -3 electrocatalyst exhibited superior UOR performance with a required potential of 1.32 V at 10 mA cm $^{-2}$  in 0.3 Mm urea and 1 M KOH solution. Additionally, when a two-electrode system with Mo-Co $_3$ O $_4$ -3 electrocatalyst, cell

voltages of 1.53 and 1.42 V were required to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> for total water and urea splitting. XPS and ESR results indicate a higher concentration of oxygen vacancies in Mo-Co3O4-3. In-situ/*Operando* Raman spectroscopy reveals the significance of CoOOH as fast active sites, contributing to enhanced OER activity in Mo-Co3O4-3 compared to pure Co3O4. In-situ/*Operando* EXAFS spectroscopy demonstrates the dynamic evolution of the surface species in the defective Mo-Co3O4-3 electrocatalyst under OER. This analysis indicates that the oxygen vacancies in Mo-Co3O4 are initially filled with OH• facilitating the pre-oxidation of low-valence Co and promoting the deprotonation of intermediate Co−OOH• at a lower potential. Notably, the incorporation of Mo into Co3O4 changes the local electronic structures and generates a more favorable local bonding environment, resulting in significant surface reconstruction, consequently improving the alkaline OER activity of Mo-Co3O4- 3. Given that oxygen vacancies in Co3O4 have been established as highly efficient for OER, this study offers an effective strategy for rationally fabricating and modifying nanostructures with efficient electrocatalytic activity.

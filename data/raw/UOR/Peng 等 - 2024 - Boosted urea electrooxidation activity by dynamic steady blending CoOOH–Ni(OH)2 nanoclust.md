Electrochemical urea oxidation reaction (UOR) is a promising alternative to the oxygen evolution reaction for reducing the overall potential of the hydrogen evolution reaction during water electrolysis. The theoretical potential for the UOR is only 0.37 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). However, the kinetics of the six-electron transfer process involved in the UOR are inherently sluggish, resulting in high overpotential during the reaction. This study designed an active catalyst with a lower kinetic barrier in the UOR by fabricating blending CoOOH-Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> nanoclusters through the structural transformation of amorphous Co-Ni hydroxide films. This structural transformation was investigated using high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy, corresponding energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and in situ X-ray absorption spectra. The blending CoOOH-Ni(OH)2 nanoclusters exhibited superior electrocatalytic activity in the UOR in an alkaline environment, achieving a low onset potential of 1.24 V (vs. RHE) in 1 M KOH with 0.5 M urea. We employed the CoOOH-Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> nanoclusters as anodic electrocatalysts in a two-cell electrolyzer for asymmetric electrocatalysis. Hydrogen could be produced at a remarkable current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> at a low applied potential of only 0.45 V. Density functional theory calculations revealed that blending CoOOH-Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> nanoclusters with more oxygen vacancies exhibited a lower Gibbs free energy for the intermediate reaction pathway of NCONH<sub>2</sub>  $\rightarrow$  NCONH, compared with the fine structure of CoNiO<sub>x</sub> (x = 2-3). This study lays down a novel pathway for developing new blending electrocatalysts to be used in electrochemical reactions.

#### Introduction

Electrocatalytic water splitting<sup>1-7</sup> stands out as a highly promising strategy for producing hydrogen fuel, thus representing a crucial technique that facilitates the sustainable advancement of clean and renewable energies.<sup>8</sup> This technology is centered on improving the kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction

(OER) by developing efficient catalysts. The OER involves the oxidation of water, resulting in the generation of oxygen molecules in the electrolytic anodic cell. The electrolysis of water is costly and energy intensive due to the need to overcome the sluggishness of the kinetics of the OER. An alternative approach is to substitute the OER with more thermodynamically favorable reactions at the anode, such as oxidation reactions of ammonia,9-12 alcohol,13-16 glucose,17-20 hydrazine,21-25 and urea.26-30 This substitution can enable water electrolysis with lower overpotential and energy input. Among these reactions, the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) has attracted considerable attention because it offers the dual benefits of remediating urine-rich water and facilitating hydrogen production. The electrochemical UOR is a complex multistep process that includes urea adsorption, electrochemical preoxidation, and product desorption. The complete UOR involves six consecutive proton-coupled electron transfer steps in the presence of hydroxyl groups. The final products of the UOR are nitrogen and carbon dioxide, with an ideal equilibrium potential of 0.37 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), which is lower than the theoretical potential of water splitting (1.23 V vs. RHE).

general UOR is represented as follows:  $CO(NH_3)_{2(aq)} + 6OH^- \rightarrow$  $N_{2(g)} + 5H_2O_{(aq)} + CO_{2(g)} + 6e^-$ . The efficiency of the UOR can be enhanced by developing highly efficient catalysts or adjusting the electrolytic conditions of the reaction. Therefore, considerable research has been dedicated to exploring diverse electrode materials, with the aim of enhancing the kinetics of urea electro-oxidation.

Several types of catalysts have been developed for the UOR, such as noble metals,31-34 transition metal oxides,35-40 metal sulfides, 41,42 and metal selenides. 43-46 However, these catalysts still resulted in higher overpotential in driving the UOR, relative to the ideal potential of 0.37 V (vs. RHE). In contrast to the OER, the UOR involves the adsorption and desorption of numerous intermediates, which results in intricate reactions with sluggish kinetics. A composite comprising nickel oxide encapsulated within nitrogen-doped carbon (NiOx/CNx) has been used to catalyze the UOR in a solution of 1 M KOH and 0.33 M urea using a three-electrode system.47 For the UOR, the onset potential is approximately 1.36 V versus RHE, and the potential at a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> is 1.378 V versus RHE. Moreover, metal sulfides grown on carbon cloth yielded an operation potential of 1.36 V for the UOR in a solution of 1.0 M KOH with 0.5 M urea, corresponding to a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. Recent studies have reported that nickel- or cobaltbased catalysts with an oxidation state of 3+ demonstrated better electrochemical activity in the UOR. Ni-based oxide or oxyhydroxide catalysts composed of multiple transition elements also exhibited superior catalytic activity compared with their single-element counterparts because of synergistic effects and the tunable electronic structure of the active sites on the surface. The use of high-valent Ni species lowers the Gibbs free energy of the UOR, resulting in the tuning of the binding strength of the active sites with the \*COO reaction intermediate.48,49 For example, nickel tungsten oxyhydroxides formed from the oxidation of Ni/W<sub>5</sub>N<sub>4</sub> exhibited catalytic activity in the UOR with a potential of only 1.34 V (vs. RHE) at a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>.50 However, Ni-based catalysts are associated with an overpotential that is still much higher compared with the ideal equilibrium potential of the UOR. Although many studies have focused on improving the catalytic activity and reducing the overpotential of this reaction, designing novel active electrocatalysts for countering the sluggish kinetics of the six-electron transfer process in the UOR remains a formidable challenge.

The engineering of cation or oxygen vacancies in metal oxides has emerged as a promising approach for enhancing the electrocatalytic performance in the UOR. This strategy offers several advantages: (1) the geometric arrangement of coordinated atoms can be altered by introducing cation or oxygen vacancies; (2) the adsorption ability of reactants and intermediates can be enhanced; (3) the exposure of catalytically active surfaces can be significantly increased, resulting in the redistribution of charge density on metal sites. Therefore, amorphous layered metal oxides, hydroxides, or oxyhydroxides are believed to provide optimal electrocatalytic conditions for investigating structure-activity relationships in rational catalyst development because an amorphous structure lacking longrange order is associated with a lower coordination number of metal and oxygen atoms, compared with a crystalline structure. In other words, an amorphous structure affords a high number of cation or oxygen vacancies. Moreover, nanostructures with a size < 5 nm provided a high surface area per unit volume, resulting in a higher number of active sites on the surface and enhanced catalytic activity.

Aiming to design an active catalyst with a higher number of vacancies, we prepared a blending CoOOH-Ni(OH)2 nanocluster from an amorphous Co-Ni hydroxide film using a twostep process, involving the electrochemical deposition of amorphous Co-Ni hydroxide at high potential and structural transformation to obtain CoOOH-Ni(OH)2 nanoclusters in alkaline electrolyte. We found that the blending CoOOH-Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> nanoclusters, with a size < 5 nm, exhibited enhanced catalytic activity in the UOR in an alkaline environment, achieving a low onset potential of 1.24 V (vs. RHE) in a solution of 1 M KOH with 0.5 M urea. A current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> could be achieved by applying a slightly higher potential of 1.28 V. Furthermore, the CoOOH-Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> nanocluster has been utilized as an anodic electrocatalyst in the design of a twoelectrode electrolyzer for asymmetric electrocatalysis. The strategies of asymmetric electrocatalysis have been applied for direct seawater electrolysis for green hydrogen production. Asymmetric electrolyte feeds enhance the performance of seawater electrolyzers and prevent the unwanted alkalinization of seawater.51-54 Therefore, This design used in the UOR system achieved a remarkable current density of 50 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> at a low applied potential of 0.56 V, outperforming the efficiency of hydrogen evolution on the cathode. The structural transformation of Co-Ni hydroxide into blending CoOOH-Ni(OH)2 nanoclusters under the application of different potentials was analyzed using high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM), corresponding energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and in situ X-ray absorption spectra (XAS). Density functional theory calculations revealed that the blending CoOOH-Ni(OH)2 nanocluster with more surface vacancies yielded a lower Gibbs energy for the NCONH<sub>2</sub> → NCONH reaction pathway, compared with finestructure  $CoNiO_x$  (x = 2-3). Our findings elucidate the intricate structural transformations involved in the conversion of amorphous Co-Ni hydroxide to CoOOH-Ni(OH)2 nanoclusters, which serve as active catalysts in the UOR. Our findings aid the design of efficient and sustainable electrochemical systems.

#### Result and discussion

An electrochemical deposition method was employed to fabricate as-prepared binary Co-Ni hydroxide grown on carbon fiber paper (Co-Ni hydroxide/CFP). Two Co-Ni hydroxide/CFP samples were prepared with growth times of 300 s and 1800 s, and their structures in the amorphous phase were verified using X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, XAS, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (see ESI, Fig. S1-S3†). To investigate the electrocatalytic activity of the Co-Ni hydroxide/CFP samples in the UOR, a three-electrode electrochemical reaction system was set up in a cell, consisting of a working electrode (Co-Ni hydroxide/CFP samples), a reference electrode, a counter electrode (Pt wire), and an electrolytic solution of 1 M KOH and 0.5 M urea (Fig. 1(a)). Fig. 1(b) shows linear scan voltammetry curves for various materials in relation to the UOR, with a scan rate of 10 mV s<sup>-1</sup>. The results demonstrated that Co-Ni hydroxide/CFP (300 s) exhibited the lowest onset potential of approximately 1.24 V (vs. RHE), surpassing the onset potentials of Co-Ni hydroxide/CFP (1800 s) (1.31 V vs. RHE), Ni hydroxide/ CFP (1.31 V vs. RHE), and Co hydroxide/CFP (1.33 V vs. RHE). Fig. 1(c) shows the corresponding Tafel plots of the aforementioned samples in the UOR. Co-Ni hydroxide/CFP (300 s) exhibited better activity in the UOR with a Tafel slope of 37.2 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>, which was much lower than the Tafel slopes of Co-Ni hydroxide/CFP (300 s) (65.3 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>), Ni hydroxide/CFP (59.6 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>), and Co hydroxide/CFP (61.5 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>). Our designed catalysts demonstrated superior electrocatalytic activity in the UOR compared with previously reported catalysts (see Table S1†).

A homemade electrolyzer of a two-electrode system separated by a Nafion membrane was arranged in an asymmetric electrocatalysis system to perform the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the UOR, separately (Fig. 2(a)). Pt wire and

Co-Ni hydroxide/CFP (300 s) served as the cathode and anode, which were operated in 0.5 M  $H_2SO_4$  (pH = 0.3) and 0.5 M urea/ 1 M KOH (pH = 13.3), respectively. Using different electrolytes with a pH gradient likely induces changes in the operation potential.55 In a forward asymmetric electrocatalysis system, the reaction potential can be reduced according to the Nernst equation (see ESI†). Moreover, using a Nafion membrane separator enables the separation of products generated from the anodic (OER) and cathodic (HER) reactions. Our previous study<sup>56</sup> demonstrated the formation of a liquid junction at the Nafion membrane separator in a two-electrode system. Therefore, two electrodes during the electrochemical operation were placed at the closest distance from each other (approximately 25 μm), which was derived from the thickness of the Nafion membrane. Fig. 2(b) shows representative linear scan voltammetry curves of Co-Ni hydroxide/CFP (300 s) and Ni hydroxide/ CFP in the designed electrolyzer. The lowest potential of Co-Ni hydroxide/CFP (300 s) used as an anodic catalyst to initiate the HER and UOR in an asymmetric electrocatalysis system was found to be 0.45 V, corresponding to a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. To date, this is the lowest measured potential for the HER in an asymmetric electrocatalysis system (Table S2†). Ni

hydroxide/CFP (300 s) exhibited a higher onset potential of 0.51 V for the HER and UOR. Fig. 2(c) illustrates the stability of Co-Ni hydroxide/CFP (300 s) over a period of 24 hours in a twoelectrode system. The electrochemical reaction potential remained constant despite the electrolyte being changed every 6 hours, highlighting the stability of Co-Ni hydroxide/CFP (300 s) in facilitating the UOR. To investigate the structural stability of Co-Ni hydroxide/CFP (300 s), linear scan voltammetry curves for the UOR were obtained before and after the reaction. Only a slight change in potential was observed after the reaction, implying that Co-Ni hydroxide maintains good stability in the UOR.

In situ XAS analysis was conducted on representative Co-Ni hydroxide/CFP (300 s) samples during the UOR to further explore the chemical environment of Co and Ni within Co-Ni hydroxide catalysts during electrochemical reactions. Fig. 3(a) and (b) depict the in situ Co K-edge and Ni K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra for pristine Co-Ni hydroxide, pristine Co-Ni hydroxide in KOH, Co-Ni hydroxide at different potentials during the UOR, and two reference materials (Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> and CoOOH). The results showed that under the initial conditions, the Co K-edge and Ni K-edge XANES spectra of pristine Co-Ni hydroxide were attributed to Co<sup>2+</sup> and Ni<sup>2+</sup>, similar to the near-edge spectra of Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> and Ni(OH)2, respectively. Also, the white line of the Co K-edge (Fig. 3(a)) was observed to dramatically decrease when pristine Co-Ni hydroxide was immersed in KOH, but the pre-edge position remained unchanged relative to that of the pristine one. After the UOR was initiated, the XANES of the Co K-edge shifted toward a higher energy, signifying a transition in Co species from lower to higher oxidation states. At 0.8 V, because the spectra resembled that of the reference CoOOH, Co species were confirmed to transform into CoOOH with a 3+ oxidation state. Subsequently, at 1.6 V, the pre-edge of the Co K-edge surpassed that of the reference CoOOH, indicating a vigorous oxidation reaction transpiring within the catalyst itself. Conversely, Ni species within the catalyst (Fig. 3(b)) maintained a stable oxidation state resembling that of Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>, even after immersion in KOH and after applying a potential as high as 1.6 V. Furthermore, Fourier transform extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) analysis of the Co and Ni K-edge was performed to elucidate the fine structural transformations of Co and Ni within Co-Ni hydroxide during the UOR (Fig. 3(c) and (d)). In the Co K-edge EXAFS spectra (Fig. 3(c)), pristine Co-Ni hydroxide exhibited a peak at 1.6 Å, indicative of the contribution of the nearest neighbor (Co-O bond) without a Co-Co

metal bond, suggesting an amorphous structure. Aer immersing in KOH, an additional peak appeared at 2.7 Å, which could represent the contribution of the Co–Co bond in Co(OH)2, suggesting a conspicuous structural transformation from amorphous to crystalline form. As the potential increased from zero to 0.8 V, the peak of the Co–Co bond shied to 2.3 Å,

implying that the Co structure was modified again to that in CoOOH. The intensity of the Co-Co bond of CoOOH increased with an increase in potential from 0.8 to 1.6 V. The EXAFS spectra of the Ni K-edge (Fig. 3(d)) revealed a peak at 1.5 Å, corresponding to the Ni-O bond within the pristine Co-Ni hydroxide, with no Ni-Ni bond detected. When immersed in KOH, the Ni-Ni bond appeared at 2.7 Å, indicating that Ni species in Co-Ni hydroxide underwent structural transformation from the amorphous to the crystalline form, similar to that in Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>. However, when the UOR was initiated and the potential was continuously increased, the fine structure of Ni species in Co-Ni hydroxide remained similar to that in Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>. Overall, these results indicate the evolving structure of Co-Ni hydroxide during the UOR, involving the formation of CoOOH and Ni(OH)2 phases within the catalyst.

High-resolution transmission electron microscopy was used to further investigate the structural morphology of Co-Ni hydroxide/CFP after the UOR (Fig. 4(a)). The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy images indicated that Co-Ni hydroxide with a large area (represented in pink) was grown along with graphite materials (represented in green) contributed to by CFP. No obvious lattice was observed for Co-Ni hydroxide at this magnification, but only the lattice distance of graphite materials with 3.4 Å were shown. Furthermore, HAADF-STEM equipped with EDS element mapping was applied to gain more insight into the detailed morphology of Co-Ni hydroxide catalysts after the UOR. The HAADF-STEM images revealed the presence of small nanoclusters (less than 5 nm in size) with an obvious lattice in the Co-Ni hydroxide part (Fig. 4(b)). The lattice distance was estimated to be approximately 2.5 Å (Fig. 4(c)), which is close to the (101) and (100) facets of CoOOH and Ni(OH)2, respectively. The HAADF-STEM and corresponding EDS element mapping images of C, O, Co, and Ni, as well as a merged image are shown in Fig. 4(d). The

results demonstrated that Co (pink), Ni (red), and O (cyan) were homogeneously distributed among the nanoclusters (merge) grown on carbon substrate (green). Element analysis using EDS established that the quantitative ratio of Co, Ni, and O in Co-Ni hydroxide nanoparticles was approximately 1:1:2.5. The results of in situ XAS analysis and HAADF-STEM with EDS mapping revealed that the amorphous structure of Co-Ni hydroxide was transformed to a crystalline form after the UOR, accompanied by the formation of blending CoOOH-Ni(OH)2 nanoclusters, which could be attributed to the phenomenon of Ostwald ripening. Compared with previously reported catalysts, the blending CoOOH-Ni(OH)2 nanocluster exhibited superior UOR activity, likely because these nanoclusters with less crystallinity possess more defect cation vacancies. This is first report to demonstrate an ultra-small blending CoOOH-Ni(OH)2 nanocluster with high dispersion on the conductive substrate. Density functional theory simulations can provide more insights into the structural transformation of Co–Ni hydroxide with fine crystal structure into blending CoOOH–Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> nanoclusters during the UOR.

To further clarify the interaction between these surfaces and urea, we employed charge difference contours to analyze the electronic behaviors between the substrates and adsorbates (Fig. 5(a)). The cyan and yellow regions represent charge depletion and accumulation, respectively. The charge difference graph indicates that the charge transfers between  $(OH_{sur})_7O_v$ – $CoNiO_x(100)$  and urea were much stronger than with the other two surfaces, implying that the adsorption energy of urea was the largest on  $(OH_{sur})_7O_v$ – $CoNiO_x(100)$ . Next, the plausible mechanistic steps involved in urea oxidation were computationally explored by considering the various dehydrogenated intermediates on the  $CoNiO_x(100)$  and  $(OH_{sur})_7O_v$ – $CoNiO_x(100)$ 

surface. The relative free energies  $(\Delta G)$  with respect to the minimum geometries (all marked as 0 eV) at each dehydrogenation stage were labeled in Fig. 5(b). Our calculations indicate that urea can be preferentially reduced to NCONH2 on these two surfaces; thus, after NCONH2 generation, the subsequent competitive reaction paths should be further considered: (I)  $NCONH_2 \rightarrow NCONH \rightarrow N_2 + CO$ ; and (II)  $NCONH_2 \rightarrow NNH +$  $CO \rightarrow N_2 + CO$ . Compared with the NCONH<sub>2</sub>  $\rightarrow$  NNH + CO step, the  $NCONH_2 \rightarrow NCONH$  step is more feasible the on  $(OH_{sur})_7O_v$ -CoNiO<sub>x</sub>(100) surface. By contrast, the NCONH<sub>2</sub>  $\rightarrow$ NNH + CO intermediate is thermodynamically more favorable on the CoNiO<sub>x</sub>(100) surface. Notably, regardless of path I or path II, the (OH<sub>sur</sub>)<sub>7</sub>O<sub>v</sub>-CoNiO<sub>x</sub>(100) surface is more advantageous for the UOR than the CoNiO<sub>x</sub>(100) surface. Therefore, compared with crystalline Co(OH)2 or Ni(OH)2, blending CoOOH-Ni(OH)2 nanoclusters with less crystallinity possess more oxygen vacancies, which can enhance urea absorption ability, resulting in a lower kinetic barrier and enhanced electrocatalytic activity in the UOR.

#### Conclusions

An active electrocatalyst for the UOR was fabricated using a novel strategy involving the structural transformation of CoOOH and Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> into blending nanoclusters with more oxygen vacancies, thus facilitating urea absorption and catalysis on the catalyst surface. Therefore, the blending CoOOH-Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> nanocluster exhibits superior and stable electrocatalytic activity in the UOR, with an onset potential only 0.01 V higher than the thermodynamic OER potential (1.23 V vs. RHE). In an asymmetric electrolyzer, the corresponding two-electrode system can achieve a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> at a cell potential of 0.45 V, which substantially reduces energy consumption for hydrogen production through the electrolysis of water. The construction of a blending CoOOH-Ni(OH)2 nanocluster to control oxygen vacancy for achieving superior electrocatalytic activity provides us with a new strategy for exploring other types of novel catalysts for electrocatalytic applications.

# **Experiment section**

#### **Materials**

CoSO<sub>4</sub>·5H<sub>2</sub>O, NiSO<sub>4</sub>·6H<sub>2</sub>O and KOH were obtained from Fisher. CO(NH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Carbon fiber paper (CFP) was procured from CeTech Co., Ltd. and used as a substrate. Deionized water (DI water) was used throughout the experiments. All chemicals were used without further refinement.

#### Synthesis of the Co-Ni oxide@CFP precursor

The Co-Ni@CFP composite was synthesized via an electrochemical method. Initially, the carbon fiber paper was cut into 1  $\times$  5 cm<sup>2</sup>. Subsequently, a area 1  $\times$  1 cm<sup>2</sup> segment of the CFP was immersed in a metal salt solution containing 2 M CoSO<sub>4</sub> and 2 M NiSO<sub>4</sub> and connect it in two-electrode electrochemical

system. To deposite Co-Ni hydroxide on CFP, a constant current of 50 mA was applied for 300 and 1800 seconds, respectively. after the electrodeposition process, the samples were rinsed with deionized (DI) water and then dried at 100 °C.

#### Characterizations

The morphologies of the samples were examined by Field emission scanning electron microscopy (JEOL JSM-7800F). The structure analysis was performed by using an X-ray diffraction instrument (Rigaku Miniex 600). Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the sample were recorded by an XRD instrument (Rigaku Miniflex 600). The HRTEM images and HAADF-STEM with EDS mapping of the sample were captured by JEM-ARM300F2. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) measurements were collected at the beamline (TPS 44A) of the National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center.

#### **Electrochemical measurements**

A conventional three-electrode system (utilizing a CHI-660 electrochemical analyzer) was employed for investigating the electrochemical reaction. In this setup, the as-prepared samples deposited on the CFP substrate served as the working electrode, while a standard calomel electrode (SCE) functioned as the reference electrode, and platinum (Pt) wire acted as the counter electrode for assessing OER activity and durability. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was conducted at a scan rate of 10 mV s<sup>-1</sup> with 95% IR compensation in an electrolyte comprising 1 M KOH and 0.5 M urea. All potentials in this study were referenced to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) via the Nernst equation conversion.

Quantum-chemical calculations. All calculations were performed with the DFT plane-wave method utilizing the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP).57-60 We used the projectoraugmented-wave method (PAW)61,62 in conjunction with generalized gradient-approximation (GGA) calculation, and Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE)63 exchange-correlation functional was applied. To allowed us to proceed with a series of catalytic reactions, we used the  $p(2 \times 2)$  for CoNiO<sub>3</sub>(100) surface to ensure that the distance between the adsorbates are greater than an effective distance of van der Waals force. To ensure the structure of the catalyst used in the simulation was as consistent as possible with the experiment, we removed part of the oxygen atoms in the CoNiO3 and further optimized it to form the most stable  $CoNiO_{x (x=2-3)}$ .

The detailed structure for  $CoNiO_{x}$  (x=2-3) (100) surface is shown in Fig. X1(a).† During these calculations the bottom atomic layer of surfaces were kept frozen, whereas the remaining layers were fully relaxed. For the DFT calculations, we chose the cutoff energy at 500 eV with  $8 \times 8 \times 8$  and  $3 \times 3 \times 1$  k-point mesh for bulk and surfaces models, respectively. All of the calculations performed in this study are spin-polarized and dipole corrected. The electronic convergences criteria are set by 10<sup>-5</sup> eV, and the width of second order Methfessel-Paxton smearing is applied with value of 0.1 eV. All geometries are fully relaxed and the energies are converged satisfying criterion of 5  $\times$  10<sup>-2</sup> eV Å<sup>-1</sup> for maximal components of forces. The bottom

atomic layer kept frozen with the remaining layers fully relaxed for these calculated slabs. In all cases, the slab calculations included a vacuum region of thickness greater than 15 Å, large enough to ensure no interaction between the two slabs. The adsorption energies were calculated based on the following equation,

$$\Delta E_{\text{ads}} = E[\text{slab} + \text{adsorbate}] - (E[\text{slab}] + E[\text{adsorbate}])$$

in which  $E[{\rm slab} + {\rm adsorbate}]$ ,  $E[{\rm slab}]$ , and  $E[{\rm adsorbate}]$  were the calculated electronic energies of adsorbed species on the above surfaces, clean surfaces and free molecules, respectively. The solvation effects were considered with an implicit solvation model as implemented in VASPsol.<sup>64</sup> The implicit solvent effect of water was adopted the dielectric constant of 78.355.

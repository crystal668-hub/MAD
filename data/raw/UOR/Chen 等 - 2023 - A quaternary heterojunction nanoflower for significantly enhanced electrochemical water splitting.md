Designing highly-efficient, cost-effective, and stable electrocatalysts for water splitting is essential to producing green hydrogen. In this work, a nanoflower quaternary heterostructured Ni(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(OH)<sub>4</sub>/Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>/Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub>/NiFe-LDH electrocatalyst is successfully synthesized by two-step hydrothermal reactions. The sulfur in the electrocatalyst induces higher valence state metal atoms as active sites to accelerate the formation of O<sub>2</sub>. As expected, benefiting from the unique structural features and solid electronic interactions, Ni (NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(OH)<sub>4</sub>/Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>/Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub>/NiFe-LDH exhibits remarkable oxygen evolution reaction performance with a low overpotential of 223 mV at a current density of 100 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, a slight Tafel slope of 65.4 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>, and outstanding stability in alkaline media. Attractively, using Ni(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(OH)<sub>4</sub>/Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>/Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub>/NiFe-LDH as both a cathode and an anode, the alkaline electrolyzer delivers a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> only at a cell voltage of 1.67 V, accompanied by superior durability. This work provides a facile method for the rational design of high-performance quaternary electrocatalysts.

#### 1. Introduction

Hydrogen has been deemed the most sustainable, environmentally-friendly and cleanest energy carrier to replace traditional fossil fuels. Nowadays, electrochemical water splitting driven by electricity from sustainable energy sources is the primary method for producing high-purity hydrogen with a zero-carbon footprint.<sup>1-4</sup> However, the efficiency of hydrogen production during water splitting is highly dependent on the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) occurring on the anode, which is kinetically sluggish due to the high energy barrier involved in the four-electron transfer steps.<sup>5-10</sup> IrO<sub>2</sub> and RuO<sub>2</sub> are regarded as the state-of-the-art OER catalysts because of their high efficiency in a wide pH range. However, their widespread adoption and usage are hindered by their high cost and low abundance.<sup>11-15</sup> In recent years, many efforts have been devoted to exploring cost-efficient and Earth-abundant OER

Although LDH has tremendous advantages in energyrelated applications, there are still some inherent drawbacks, such as low electrical conductivity and structural collapse during the exfoliation process, which results in hectic OER kinetics and inferior long-term usage.21-23 In order to overcome these disadvantages, researchers have recently developed various strategies, including anion exchange, coupling with conductive substrates, designing heterojunctions and creating vacancies.24-28 Among these, the engineering of heterogeneous interfaces consisting of two or more active building blocks is a feasible and increasingly popular approach. The heterogeneous interfaces can increase the material hierarchy and provide more active sites by improving their surface area, which is essential for both the OER and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Additionally, this approach can effectively optimize the atomic configuration and electronic structure of the catalyst. Furthermore, the strong interactions at the interface can also significantly modulate the energy band of the counterparts to promote charge transfer, thus accelerating the HER and OER. 29-32 For instance, Liang and her co-workers designed an FeOOH/NiFe-LDH heterojunction for a highly

electrocatalysts with high activity and stability. By far, transition-metal compounds and/or composites, such as oxides, hydroxides, nitrides, phosphides, sulfides, and selenides, have been developed to achieve efficient OER catalysis. <sup>16–20</sup> Therein, NiFe-LDH has attracted particular attention due to its superior OER activities. <sup>21–28</sup>

efficient OER, because this unique heterostructure extends the solid–solid interface and strengthens the electronic interaction. Let and co-workers constructed a NiFe-60/Co $_3$ O $_4$ @NF core–shell structure, which exhibited excellent electrocatalytic activity due to the facilitated electron transfer at the heterointerface. Li and her co-workers prepared a NiFe-LDH@Ni $_x$ Co $_y$ Se $_2$ /NF nanosheet heterojunction, which exposed large electrocatalytically active sites and constructed an efficient electronic transmission channel by eliminating contact resistance, thus achieving an overpotential of 265.5 mV at a current density of 100 mA cm $^{-2}$ . The research on heterojunctions mainly focuses on binary and ternary heterojunctions, while quaternary heterojunctions receive less attention.

In this research study, we have designed and manufactured an integrated Ni<sub>3</sub>(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(OH)<sub>4</sub>/Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>/Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub>/NiFe-LDH heterojunction catalyst supported on nickel foam through two-step hydrothermal reaction processes. By adjusting the hydrothermal reaction temperature (120 °C, 130 °C, and 140 °C), three electrocatalysts Ni<sub>3</sub>(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(OH)<sub>4</sub>/Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>/Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub>/NiFe-LDH120 (denoted Q-NiFe120), Ni<sub>3</sub>(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(OH)<sub>4</sub>/Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>/Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub>/NiFe-LDH130 (denoted as Q-NiFe130), and Ni<sub>3</sub>(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(OH)<sub>4</sub>/Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>/Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub>/ NiFe-LDH140 (denoted as Q-NiFe140) were obtained, where the Q-NiFe130 electrocatalyst exhibited optimal bifunctional performance in an alkaline solution with an overpotential of 223 mV for the OER at a current density of 100 mV cm<sup>-2</sup> and 173 mV for the HER at a current density of 10 mV cm<sup>-2</sup>. Apparently, a symmetric two-electrode cell using Q-NiFe130 as both the cathode and anode provides a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> at a cell voltage of only 1.67 V, which is superior to most electrocatalysts for water splitting. Due to its high electrocatalytic activity and stability, as well as its low cost, the Q-NiFe130 electrocatalyst holds significant promise for water splitting under alkaline conditions.

## 2. Experimental

# 2.1 Fabrication of Ni $_3(NO_3)_2(OH)_4/Ni(OH)_2/Ni_3S_2$ (T-Ni) nanosphere arrays

Firstly, 1.5 g of Ni(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>·6H<sub>2</sub>O and 0.0543 g of L-cysteine were dissolved in 30 mL of H<sub>2</sub>O and stirred for 30 minutes to form a homogeneous solution. Then the solution was transferred into a 50 mL autoclave. Subsequently, nickel foam (NF, 2 × 3 cm²) was placed into the solution as a conductive substrate and heated at 180 °C for 6 h. After cooling to room temperature, black ternary Ni<sub>3</sub>(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(OH)<sub>4</sub>/Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>/Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub> (denoted as T-Ni) nanosphere arrays were obtained. The average mass loading was about 0.95 mg cm<sup>-2</sup>.

#### 2.2 Fabrication of Q-NiFe130 nanoflower arrays

Firstly, 0.1515 g of Fe(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>·9H<sub>2</sub>O and 0.45 g of urea were dissolved in 30 mL of H<sub>2</sub>O and stirred for 3 hours. Then the solution was transferred into a 50 mL autoclave. Subsequently, T-Ni was placed into the solution as a conductive substrate and heated at 130 °C for 12 h. After cooling to room temperature, black-green Q-NiFe130 nanoflower arrays were obtained.

The average mass loading was about 1.31 mg cm<sup>-2</sup>. Similarly, Q-NiFe120 and Q-NiFe140 were also prepared by adjusting the reaction temperature to 120 °C and 140 °C, respectively.

#### 2.3 Preparation of Pt/C and IrO2 electrodes

1.31 mg of commercial Pt/C (IrO<sub>2</sub>) powder was dispersed in a mixture of 60  $\mu$ L of ethanol, 180  $\mu$ L of ultrapure H<sub>2</sub>O and 50  $\mu$ L of Nafion (5 wt%). After 30 min of sonication, the suspension was applied to NF (1 × 1 cm<sup>2</sup>) and dried in an oven.

#### 2.4 Electrochemical measurements

All electrochemical measurements were performed on an electrochemical workstation (CHI660E) with a three-electrode system consisting of a prepared sample (working electrode with an area of  $1 \times 1$  cm<sup>2</sup> immersed in the electrolyte), Hg/ HgO (reference electrode), platinum wire and graphite rod (counter electrode) and 1 mol L<sup>-1</sup> KOH (pH 14). The measured potential was converted using the formula E (RHE) = E (Hg/ HgO) + (0.098 + 0.0592 pH) V.<sup>29</sup> Linear scanning voltammetry (LSV) was performed at a speed of 2 mV s<sup>-1</sup> and the iR correction rate for all LSV curves was manually corrected. The overpotential  $(\eta_{\text{HER/OER}})$  was obtained from  $\eta_{\text{HER/OER}} = E_{\text{RHE}} - E_{iR}$ . A series of cyclic voltammetry (CV) cycles (20, 40, 60, 80 and 100 mV s<sup>-1</sup>) were performed in the non-Faraday potential region to calculate the electrochemical double layer capacitance  $(C_{dl})$ , which was calculated to be proportional to the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA). Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were obtained at an open circuit potential of  $10^5$ – $10^{-3}$  Hz. Time potential measurements were performed at a current density of 100 mA to check the longterm durability.

#### 3. Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows a schematic illustration of the formation process of Q-NiFe130, which mainly involves a simple two-step hydrothermal reaction. The sulfhydryl group in L-cysteine provides a source of sulfur and the amino group decomposes at high temperature and combines with water to provide a basic environment; meanwhile a large amount of Ni(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>·6H<sub>2</sub>O is involved in the hydrothermal reaction to grow ternary T-Ni

nanospheres on nickel foam.<sup>36</sup> Subsequently, NiFe-LDH was introduced into T-Ni to form quaternary heterojunctions by hydrothermal reactions.

The prepared samples were characterized morphologically by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). From the SEM images of the T-Ni samples (Fig. 2a), it can be seen that T-Ni nanospheres with rough surfaces and a diameter of 3.60 µm were grown on the NF substrate, forming a three-dimensional interconnected nanosphere array, which can be used as an ideal conductive support for subsequent NiFe-LDH nanosheet growth. After the hydrothermal reaction, Q-NiFe130 presents a nanoflower structure with a smooth surface and a diameter of 6.80 µm on the NF substrate (Fig. 2b and c). The multicomponent heterostructure not only provides a larger surface area and more active sites for redox reactions, but also has an open porous structure that facilitates fast mass transport and electrolyte penetration, thus conferring a high electrocatalytic performance to the electrode.

TEM analysis further confirmed the nanoflower structure of O-NiFe130. And the hierarchical nanoflower heterojunction is constructed by three-dimensional cross-linking nanosheets (Fig. 2d-f). This structure with abundant interfaces can provide more exposed active sites and thus improve the cata-

lytic activity. The lattice stripes of 0.217 nm and 0.272 nm in Fig. 2g correspond to the (102) crystal plane of Ni<sub>3</sub>(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(OH)<sub>4</sub> and the (100) crystal plane of Ni(OH)2, respectively. The 0.203 nm lattice stripe in Fig. 2h is assigned to the (020) crystal plane of Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub> and the 0.197 nm lattice stripe in Fig. 2i corresponds to the (018) crystal plane of NiFe-LDH. The energy dispersive X-ray energy spectroscopy and elemental mapping images (Fig. 2j) show that Fe, S, Ni, O and C elements are uniformly distributed throughout Q-NiFe130.

The XRD spectra of as-prepared T-Ni and Q-NiFe130 are shown in Fig. S1.† Owing to the strong diffraction intensity of the NF substrate compared with the weak peak signals of the electrocatalyst material, the powder was scraped from NF and then measured at the same time. For T-Ni, the diffraction peaks can be well indexed to the lines of Ni(OH)2 (JCPDS No. 14-0117), Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub> (JCPDS No. 85-1802) and Ni<sub>3</sub>(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(OH)<sub>4</sub> (JCPDS No. 22-0752). 36-38 Compared with T-Ni, only the diffraction peak of NiFe-LDH (JCPDS No. 51-0463) of the Q-NiFe130 sample was increased, and no other impurity phases were found. The XRD measurements provide unarguable evidence for the successful preparation of the desired samples. Fig. S2† shows the Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra of T-Ni and Q-NiFe130. The FT-IR spectra reveal the existence of -OH stretching vibrations (~3641 cm<sup>-1</sup>), NO<sub>3</sub> vibrations

To further investigate the chemical states and electronic structures, the samples of Q-NiFe120, Q-NiFe130, Q-NiFe140, and T-Ni were analysed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Fig. 3 and Fig. S3†). In Fig. 3a, the signal peaks of Ni 2p<sub>1/2</sub> and Ni 2p<sub>3/2</sub> are observed at binding energies of 873.8 and 856.2 7 eV, respectively, accompanied by two adjacent satellite peaks at 879.5 and 861.5 eV. 39-41 In Fig. 3b, the two main peaks of Fe 2p are located at binding energies of 724.7 eV and 711.9 eV, corresponding to Fe  $2p_{3/2}$  and Fe  $2p_{1/2}$ , respectively. 42,43 In the XPS spectra of S 2p, binding energies of 162.3 eV and 163.4 eV are ascribed to S  $2p_{3/2}$  and S  $2p_{1/2}$ , and the two peaks at binding energies of 168.3 eV and 879.9 eV belong to the satellite peaks (Fig. 3c). 44-46 In the N 1s spectrum, the peaks at binding energies of 162.3 eV and 163.4 eV can be assigned to N 2p<sub>3/2</sub> and N 2p<sub>1/2</sub> with two satellite peaks at binding energies of 168.3 eV and 879.9 eV (Fig. 3d).47 It is noteworthy that the binding energies of Fe 2p and Ni 2p are positively shifted for T-Ni, while the binding energies of S 2p and N 1s are negatively shifted for T-Ni. The above evidence not only demonstrates the successful assembly of Q-NiFe120, Q-NiFe130 and Q-NiFe140, but also indicates strong electronic interactions that induce higher valence state metal atoms as active sites to accelerate the formation of O<sub>2</sub>. In particular, Q-NiFe130 has the highest degree of shift compared to Q-NiFe120 and Q-NiFe140, which proves that Q-NiFe130 has stronger electronic interactions, making it the most suitable electrocatalyst of choice for the synthesis temperature. 45

The OER performance of the catalysts was evaluated in an alkaline solution (1 mol L<sup>-1</sup> KOH) by using a three-electrode system. As depicted in Fig. 4a, Q-NiFe130 exhibits an overpotential of 227 mV at 100 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, which is significantly lower than that of Q-NiFe120 (278 mV@100 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>), Q-NiFe140 (282 mV@100 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>), T-Ni (342 mV@100 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>) and

commercial IrO2 (373@100 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>). The OER activity of Q-NiFe130 is comparable to other reported NiFe-LDH heterojunctions (Table S1†). The overpotentials of different samples are listed in Fig. 4b, suggesting that Q-NiFe130 possesses the highest OER activity. Furthermore, the Tafel slope of the Q-NiFe130 catalyst is 65.4 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>, which is significantly smaller than that of Q-NiFe120 (77.2 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>), Q-NiFe140  $(76.1 \text{ mV dec}^{-1})$ , and T-Ni  $(162.4 \text{ mV dec}^{-1})$ , suggesting a much faster OER process (Fig. 4c). The steady-state polarization curve of the activated and activity stabilized electrocatalyst was constructed by sampling OER current density at the 100th second of chronoamperometry responses (Fig. S4†) acquired at various overpotentials in the catalytic turnover region with a regular interval of 0.025 V. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was also performed to further investigate the dynamics of the electrode and electrolyte interface during the OER. The semicircle in the high-frequency region represents the charge-transfer resistance  $(R_{ct})$ , which is related to the electrocatalytic performance, and a smaller value indicates a faster electron transfer rate. As shown in Fig. 4d, Q-NiFe130 exhibits a much smaller  $R_{ct}$  than that of Q-NiFe120, Q-NiFe140 and T-Ni, further demonstrating faster electron transport and higher OER activity. In addition, the corresponding electrochemical double-layer capacitances  $(C_{dl})$  are also measured by a cyclic voltammetry (CV) method (Fig. S5†). As displayed in Fig. 4e, Q-NiFe130 exhibits the largest  $C_{dl}$  value (12.09 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>), which means that Q-NiFe130 has a larger catalytically active area, i.e., more accessible catalytic sites. The long-term stability of Q-NiFe130 was determined by chronopotentiometric measurements performed sequentially at a current density of 100 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> (Fig. 4f). Due to the robust structure of Q-NiFe130 nanoflowers, only negligible potential elevation can be observed even after 100 h of continuous testing at 100 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, and after OER cycling, the flower-like nanostructure can still be maintained (Fig. S6†), showing the excellent durability of Q-NiFe130 at a large current density. In the multistep CP curve with an increment of 20 mA per cm<sup>2</sup> per hour, all the potentials remain almost unchanged during the corresponding 1 h test, indicating facilitated mass transport and high conductivity (Fig. S7†).

As depicted in Fig. 5, the HER performance of the catalysts was evaluated in an alkaline solution (1 mol L<sup>-1</sup> KOH) using an electrochemical three-electrode system. As shown in Fig. 5a, Q-NiFe130 exhibited an overpotential of 175 mV at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, which was much lower than that of Q-NiFe120 (198 mV@10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>), Q-NiFe140 (178 mV@10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>) and T-Ni (228 mV@10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>). Additionally, the Tafel slope of the Q-NiFe130 catalyst was 87.8 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>, which was significantly smaller than that of Q-NiFe120 (119.4 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>), Q-NiFe140 (117.7 mV  $dec^{-1}$ ), and T-Ni (170.8 mV  $dec^{-1}$ ). This indicates a much faster HER process (Fig. 5b). The steady-state polarization curve of the activated and activity stabilized electrocatalyst was constructed by sampling OER current density at the 100th second of chronoamperometry responses (Fig. S8†) acquired at various overpotentials in the catalytic turnover region with a regular interval of 0.010 V. The long-term stabi-

lity of Q-NiFe130 was determined by chronopotentiometric measurements performed sequentially at a current density of 20 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> (Fig. 5c). Due to the stabilization effect of Q-NiFe130 nanoflowers, only negligible potential elevation could be observed upon continuous testing at 20 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> for 100 h. This indicates the excellent durability of Q-NiFe130 at a large current density. In the multistep CP curve with an increment of 20 mA per cm<sup>2</sup> per hour (Fig. 5d), all the potentials remained almost unchanged during the corresponding 1 h test, indicating facilitated mass transport and high conductivity.

Considering the excellent electrocatalytic performance of Q-NiFe130 for both the OER and HER, we further evaluated its

performance for overall water splitting by fabricating a two-electrode system with Q-NiFe130 as both the cathode and anode. The results show that the device requires only a small cell voltage of 1.67 V to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, which is better than the commercial catalyst  $Pt/C||IrO_2|$  (Fig. 6a). In addition, the durability tests at a fixed current of 20 mA show that the electrolyzer could operate well for 100 h without a significant decrease in cell voltage (Fig. 6b).

The faradaic efficiency of the Q-NiFe130 electrocatalyst was determined by comparing the amount of experimentally quantified gas with theoretically calculated gas. The experimentally generated gas (H2 and O2) was quantitatively measured through a water drainage method in an H-type electrolytic cell with a separate anode and cathode. As shown in Fig. 6b, the H-type electrolytic cell for overall water splitting was separated by a piece of Nafion membrane. The quantity of O2 and H2 generated at 20 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> was measured by recording the dial of the measuring cylinder every ten minutes. As depicted in Fig. 6c, the experimentally quantified gas was exactly in line with the theoretical values, revealing nearly 99.3% faradaic efficiency for both the OER and HER. Fig. 6d and f show the digital images of the measuring cylinders and the volume ratio of O<sub>2</sub> to H<sub>2</sub> was close to 0.5 at 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 min, respectively. The above results demonstrate that Q-NiFe130 is indeed a promising candidate for water electrolysis with prominent activity and remarkable stability.

In addition, the crystal structure and valence states of the elements of the Q-NiFe130 electrode (on the anode side) after overall water splitting were characterized by XRD, XPS, and Raman spectroscopy. The XRD results show that the crystalline phase of Q-NiFe130 is totally retained and no additional XRD

diffraction peaks are observed, which demonstrates its superior stability for water splitting (Fig. 7a). As shown in the Raman spectrum of Fig. 7b, the Raman bands of Q-NiFe130 shifted from 463 cm and 530 cm to 476 cm and 559 cm after the OER, which is attributed to the formation of NiOOH after

the OER.  $^{48,49}$  The formation of NiOOH is also demonstrated in the XPS spectrum of Ni 2p in Fig. 7c and Fig. S8.† In addition, inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) was performed to measure the release of S from the electrodes and the results are shown in Table S2.†

The excellent bifunctional OER and HER activities and stabilities of the as-prepared Q-NiFe130 nanoflower structure can be ascribed to the following factors: (i) the strong electronic interaction between T-Ni and NiFe-LDH enhances the electrocatalytic efficiency, (ii) the nanoflower structure provides abundant accessible active sites and forms close contact with electrolytes, which is beneficial for ion diffusion and gas release, and (iii) the direct growth on Ni foam not only guarantees good electrical conductivity, thus favoring fast electron transport, but also enables good mechanical adhesion, thereleading to excellent electrocatalytic activities and stabilities. 50,51

#### Conclusions

In conclusion, through the experiments we have done, we developed a novel quaternary heterogeneous electrocatalyst with a nanoflower structure for water splitting in alkaline solutions, which exhibits excellent bifunctional activities and stabilities for the OER and HER. The high activity of the electrocatalyst is attributed to the strong synergistic effect of T-Ni and NiFe-LDH, as well as the typical 3D interconnected architectures. These factors can contribute to fast charge transfer and mass transport and optimize the binding energies of the reaction intermediates, thus enhancing the catalytic performance. Moreover, the cell voltage was only 1.67 V at a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> by using Q-NiFe130 as both the cathode and anode. Given the high electrocatalytic activity and stability, as well as the low cost and natural abundance of LDH materials, it is expected that the as-presented Q-NiFe130 electrocatalyst will have great potential for practical alkaline overall water splitting. The synergistic effect on the catalysts still needs to be explored more deeply using in situ characterization and density functional theory calculations.

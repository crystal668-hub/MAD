# Electronic modulation of $Co_2P$ nanoneedle arrays by the doping of transition metal Cr atoms for a urea oxidation reaction $\dagger$

Xinyu Li,<sup>a</sup> Xiaoqiang Du and Xiaoshuang Zhang<sup>b</sup>

Urea electrolysis is of great interest for energy-related applications, but it is limited by a complex six-electron transfer process with slow kinetics. Herein, the *in situ* growth of Cr-doped Co<sub>2</sub>P homogeneous nanoneedle arrays on nickel foam substrates (Cr-Co<sub>2</sub>P/NF) was reported for the first time by a typical hydrothermal and low-temperature phosphorization process. The appropriate amount of Cr doping was found to promote the electronic modulation of active centers and the expansion of the specific active surface area, resulting in the superior performance of the urea oxidation reaction (UOR). It is noteworthy that  $Cr_{0.4}$ -Co<sub>2</sub>P/NF exhibited a superior performance of the UOR at an onset potential of 1.290 V and a cell voltage of 1.333 V at 50 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> in 1 M KOH containing 0.5 M urea, which is one of the best catalytic activities reported so far. The experimental results demonstrate that the enhanced catalytic activity can be attributed to favorable electronic regulation, an improved charge transfer rate and increased exposure to active sites. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation indicates that the appropriate doping of Cr effectively regulates and controls the adsorption energy of urea and the conductivity of the  $Co_2$ P material itself. This work provides new ideas for the development of robust catalysts for the electrolysis of urea through doping strategies.

# 1. Introduction

In the information age, many problems such as energy shortages and environmental pollution are becoming increasingly prominent, and are major bottlenecks limiting the development of society. <sup>1–5</sup> It has been found by scientific research that the global greenhouse effect is occurring due to carbon dioxide produced by the combustion of fossil energy. This phenomenon has caused widespread concern and reflection on the future development and power sources of society. <sup>6–10</sup> Hydrogen is widely recognized as a renewable and durable energy source, which can help to overcome the increasingly serious crisis of energy depletion. Hydrogen production *via* the electrolysis of water is an environmentally friendly and highpurity hydrogen-production method. <sup>11–16</sup> However, hydrogen production *via* the electrolysis of water has not yet been developed enough to achieve large-scale industrial production. <sup>17–20</sup>

This bottleneck is mainly assigned to the inevitable high overpotential and slow kinetics of anodic water oxidation during electrolytic hydrogen production, which requires highly active catalysts to reduce the overpotential of the reaction.<sup>21–25</sup>

Easily oxidizable nucleophilic reagents such as urea, CH<sub>3</sub>OH and C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OH can achieve cathodic hydrogen production at a lower voltage during electrolysis, which can save energy, protect the environment to a certain extent and obtain faster anodic reaction kinetics.<sup>26-29</sup> Among them, urea has the advantages of green characteristics, abundant storage, easy oxidization and convenient transportation, while urea electrolysis releases a large amount of hydrogen and purifies wastewater, etc. The development of urea electrolysis provides a new direction for energy conservation and purification.30-32 It is noteworthy that oxide, phosphide and selenide catalysts of precious metals like Ru, Ir, etc. are difficult to use on a wide scale because of their high price and scarce resources. In contrast, oxides, phosphides and selenides of transition metals such as Co, Cr, Fe and Mn have the advantages of low price, abundant reserves and superior performance for overall electrocatalytic water splitting. The catalytic performance and stability of the catalyst can be improved by adjusting the composition and structure through the optimization strategy of heterogeneous element doping into transition metal compounds. 33-35 Yuan and coworkers verified that the S-dopant-induced electronic

structure modulation of the catalytic site in S-Co<sub>2</sub>P@Ni<sub>2</sub>P contributes to the accelerated catalytic kinetics of the UOR.<sup>36</sup> Xu et al. found that the strong synergy of components and the adjustment and control of structures of the Ru-dopant and N-doped C composites promoted an excellent UOR performance of Ru-Co<sub>2</sub>P/N-C/NF.<sup>37</sup> Transition metal phosphides exhibit superior OER and UOR performance as catalysts for the electrolysis of urea and water. However, the poor stabilization of cobalt-based phosphates restricts their use for the electrolysis of urea and water, and further improvements of the catalysts are needed. The electronegativity of Cr (1.66) is lower than that of Co (1.88), and it may be a dopant for optimizing the electronic structure of cobalt-based phosphides.<sup>38,39</sup> In addition, Cr<sup>3+</sup> has a particular electrical conformation (t<sup>3</sup><sub>2g</sub>e<sup>0</sup><sub>g</sub>), which contributes to the charge translation and electronic trapping in electrocatalytic processes. 40,41 Based on the above characteristics, it can be concluded that chromium-doped cobalt-based phosphates exhibit promising activities for electrocatalytic urea electrolysis. How the active sites of the catalyst change after the Cr doping of cobalt-based phosphides needs to be studied.

In this study, the in situ growth of Cr-doped Co<sub>2</sub>P homogeneous nanoneedle arrays on nickel foam substrates (Cr-Co<sub>2</sub>P/NF) via a typical hydrothermal and low-temperature phosphorization process is reported for the first time. The appropriate amount of Cr doping was found to promote the electronic modulation of active centers and the expansion of the specific active surface area, resulting in a superior performance of the urea oxidation reaction. It is noteworthy that Cr<sub>0.4</sub>-Co<sub>2</sub>P/NF exhibits a superior performance of the UOR at an onset potential of 1.290 V and a cell voltage of 1.333 V at 50 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> in 1 M KOH containing 0.5 M urea, and this is one of the best catalytic activities reported so far. The experimental results demonstrate that the enhanced catalytic activity is attributed to favorable electronic regulation, an improved charge transfer rate and increased exposure to active sites. Density functional theory calculations indicate that the appropriate doping of Cr effectively regulates and controls the adsorption energy of urea and the conductivity of the Co<sub>2</sub>P material itself. This work provides new ideas for the development of robust catalysts for the electrolysis of urea through doping strategies.

# **Experimental section**

#### 2.1 Synthesis of Cr-Co precursors/NF materials

Nickel foams (NF) (3 cm × 7 cm) were washed with 3 M HCl and acetone in sequence for 15 min in order to remove contaminants like oxides from the surface of the NF. In detail, cobalt nitrate hexahydrate (3.6 mmol), chromium nitrate nonahydrate (0.4 mmol), ammonium fluoride (16 mmol) and urea (20 mmol) were added to 60 mL of DI water in order to produce a mixed solution under magnetic stirring at 550 rpm. The abovementioned solution was transferred into an 80 mL Teflon-lined and stainless steel autoclave, then one slice of the

above preconditioned NF was inserted in the abovementioned solution, and the autoclave was hermetically sealed and set at 120 °C for 6 h, then cooled to ambient temperature. Finally, the resulting Cr-Co (CO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>0.5</sub>(OH)/NF precursors were cleaned with deionized water and alcohol and then dried at 60 °C for 12 h. The molar amounts of the doped Cr<sup>2+</sup> ions were varied to 0 mmol, 0.3 mmol and 0.5 mmol respectively, and electrodes with different contents of Cr were prepared according to the same method.

#### 2.2 Synthesis of Cr<sub>x</sub>-Co<sub>2</sub>P on nickel foam

Cr<sub>x</sub>-Co<sub>2</sub>P/NF and Co<sub>2</sub>P/NF were prepared using a low-temperature phosphidation process. The details of the synthesis are as follows: 1 g NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>2</sub> and the obtained Cr-Co precursor were placed separately in crucibles and transferred to the upstream and the downstream of a tubular stove, respectively. After that, the above obtained substances in the tubular stove were calcined at 300 °C for 2 h with a temperature rate of 2 °C min<sup>-1</sup> under a N<sub>2</sub> atmosphere with a flow rate of 300 sccm to obtain Cr<sub>0.4</sub>-Co<sub>2</sub>P/NF. For comparison, Co<sub>2</sub>P/NF, Cr<sub>0.3</sub>-Co<sub>2</sub>P/NF and Cr<sub>0.5</sub>-Co<sub>2</sub>P/NF with different Cr contents were prepared under identical conditions. The loading amount of Cr<sub>0.4</sub>-Co<sub>2</sub>P was  $2.86 \text{ mg cm}^{-2}$ .

#### 2.3 Material characterization

X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a Philips 1130 X-ray diffractometer (40 kV, 30 mA, Cu KR radiation,  $\lambda$  = 1.5418 Å) to determine the phase composition. The morphology of the Cr-Co-M (M = O and P) material was characterized using SEM images (Hitachi S-4800). TEM images were recorded on a JEM-2100 with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The chemical composition and elemental states were analyzed using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Axis Ultra DLD) using 60 W monochromated Mg Ka radiation as the exciting source.

#### 2.4 Electrochemical tests

Electrochemical performance testing of all prepared materials was done using an electrochemistry workstation (CHI 660E) at room temperature in a mixture of 0.5 M urea and 1 M potassium hydroxide. In the three-electrode system, the obtained Cr<sub>0.4</sub>-Co<sub>2</sub>P/NF, Co<sub>2</sub>P/NF, Cr<sub>0.3</sub>-Co<sub>2</sub>P/NF and Cr<sub>0.5</sub>-Co<sub>2</sub>P/NF were employed directly as the working electrode, a graphite rod was employed as the counter electrode and a Ag/AgCl electrode was employed as the reference electrode. Unless otherwise indicated, all of the potentials obtained in the electrochemical test were transformed to the invertible hydrogen electrode potential using the following equation: E(RHE) = E(Ag/AgCl) + 0.197+ 0.059 × pH. In this paper, every working electrode was electrochemically activated by measuring twenty cycles in cyclic voltammetry (CV) experiments with a scan rate of 100 mV s<sup>-1</sup>. Then, the LSV measurements were performed with a mixture of 0.5 M urea containing 1 M KOH at a scan rate of 5 mV s<sup>-1</sup> with iR compensation. The Tafel slope was derived from the linear fitting of the Tafel diagrams according to the Tafel equation  $(\eta = a + b \log(j))$ , where b is the Tafel slope. The

electrochemical double-layer capacitance ( $C_{\rm dl}$ ) was determined from the CV curves measured at different scanning speeds (20, 40, 60, 80 and 100 mV s<sup>-1</sup>). The electrochemical impedance spectrum (EIS) recordings were made over a frequency scale from 0.1 Hz to  $10^5$  Hz at an open circuit potential with 50 mV

#### 3.1. Characterization studies of electrocatalysts

The Cr-Co<sub>2</sub>P/NF nanoneedle arrays were prepared using a hydrothermal process, followed by a low-temperature stream phosphorization process with  $NaH_2PO_2$  under a  $N_2$  atmosphere at 300 °C, as mentioned in Scheme 1.

The SEM images of  $Cr_{0.4}$ - $Co_2P/NF$  (Fig. 1a and b) show that the disordered and dense 3D nanoneedle arrays homogeneously covered the surface of the Ni foam skeletons. The SEM images of  $Co_2P/NF$  (Fig. 1c and d) show that disordered clustered nanoneedle arrays homogeneously grow on the surface of the Ni foam. Compared with  $Co_2P/NF$ , it is indicated that the active sites on the surface of the Ni foam can be increased by doping with Cr, and the nanoneedle arrays attached on the top of the Ni foam are not tightly bound into a flower shape, which makes its specific surface area increase, thus exposing more active sites of the catalyst and improving the UOR performance of the catalyst.

As shown in Fig. 1e–h, it was found that the morphology of the material changed significantly with changing the molar amount of Cr doping. The density of the nanoneedle array loaded on the Ni foam decreased with the decrease in the molar amount of the doped Cr for  $\rm Cr_{0.3}$ - $\rm Co_2P/NF$  (Fig. 1e and f). With the increase in the molar amount of the doped Cr, the nanoneedle arrays loaded on the Ni foam gradually transformed into irregular mixed arrays of nanosheets and nanoneedles in  $\rm Cr_{0.5}$ - $\rm Co_2P/NF$  (Fig. 1g and h). Only  $\rm Cr_{0.4}$ - $\rm Co_2P/NF$  catalysts prepared with 0.4 mmol of Cr doping had a distinctive nanostructure that provided a larger number of active centers and a bigger active surface region. The EDS spectra show the distribution of elements and the molar amount of every atom in the  $\rm Cr_{0.4}$ - $\rm Co_2P/NF$  catalyst (Fig. S1 and

Table S1 $\dagger$ ). The experimental results suggest that Cr can be doped into the Co<sub>2</sub>P/NF material in the form of metal ions.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) is an outstanding characterization technique that is used to analyze the chemical composition qualitatively. Among the XRD peaks of Cr<sub>0.4</sub>-Co<sub>2</sub>P/NF, Co<sub>2</sub>P/NF, Cr<sub>0.3</sub>-Co<sub>2</sub>P/NF and Cr<sub>0.5</sub>-Co<sub>2</sub>P/NF, three significant peaks at 44.51°, 51.85° and 76.37° are ascribed to the Ni foam substrate (PDF no. 04-0850). The diffraction peaks located at 40.84° and 48.38° can be attributed to the (111) and (120) crystal planes of Co<sub>2</sub>P (PDF no. 54-0413), respectively. Because of the poor crystallinity of Cr<sub>x</sub>-Co<sub>2</sub>P/NF, some diffraction peaks may not appear. The diffraction peaks located at 39.53° and 47.33° can be assigned to the (231) and (340) crystal planes of Co  $(CO_3)_{0.5}(OH)$  (PDF no. 48-0083), 42 indicating that a small amount of the Co(CO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>0.5</sub>(OH) precursor was not completely phosphorylated on the prepared sample of Cr<sub>0.5</sub>-Co<sub>2</sub>P/NF. The diffraction peak of the catalyst is not obvious because the peak of the nickel foam is too strong. We also tried to scrape the catalyst off the nickel foam, but we failed because the catalyst loading was too low.43 It is noteworthy that the crystal structures of Cr<sub>x</sub>-Co<sub>2</sub>P with different Cr doping degrees were characPaper **Dalton Transactions** 

terized by XRD, in which the same diffraction peaks were found with a different shifted angle. The peaks in the XRD characterization were further calculated using the Scherrer equation  $(Dhkl = k\lambda/(\beta\cos\theta))$ , and after calculating the grain size of Cr<sub>x</sub>-Co<sub>2</sub>P, it was found that the grain size of Cr<sub>0.4</sub>-Co<sub>2</sub>P was the smallest (0.108 nm), while the grain sizes of Co<sub>2</sub>P, Cr<sub>0.3</sub>-Co<sub>2</sub>P and Cr<sub>0.5</sub>-Co<sub>2</sub>P were 0.251 nm, 0.138 nm and 0.175 nm, respectively. The results show that the different grain sizes of Crx-Co2P indicate different degrees of offset. These key phenomena indicate that Cr with a large atomic radius was successfully doped into the Co<sub>2</sub>P lattice in Cr<sub>x</sub>-Co<sub>2</sub>P materials (Fig. 2).44

The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was utilized to determine the elemental valence state of the electrocatalyst surface, and the elements of Co, Cr, P, and O were revealed with no other impurities (Fig. 3a). As displayed in Fig. 3b, the XPS peaks at 781.8 eV and 797.9 eV were indexed to Co 2p<sub>3/2</sub> and Co 2p<sub>1/2</sub>, respectively, with the satellite peaks of 786.7 eV and 803.4 eV.

The fitting characteristic peaks at binding energies of 781.5 eV and 782.5 eV are assigned to Co 2p<sub>3/2</sub> and the fitting characteristic peaks at binding energies of 797.4 eV and 798.5 eV are attributed to Co 2p<sub>1/2</sub>. The result indicates that Co has two oxidation states in the Cr<sub>0.4</sub>-Co<sub>2</sub>P/NF catalyst. The XPS peaks at 778.5 eV and 793.3 eV are assigned to the Co-P bonds. 45 The XPS peaks at 577.84 eV and 587.70 eV were assigned to Cr 2p<sub>3/2</sub> and Cr 2p<sub>1/2</sub>, respectively, with the satellite peak of 580.65 eV. There is no characteristic peak for the Cr-P bond, which proves that the prepared catalyst is a chromium-doped Co<sub>2</sub>P electrocatalyst<sup>46</sup> (Fig. 3c). The characteristic peaks of P 2p at 129.20 eV and 130.04 eV are attributed to P 2p3/2 and P 2p<sub>1/2</sub>, respectively. And the third P 2p peak at about 134.20 eV can be assigned to the surface-oxidized P-O bond (Fig. 3d). The three peaks of deconvolution (labeled Oa, Ov, and Om) appear in the high-resolution O 1s spectra of Cr<sub>0.4</sub>-Co<sub>2</sub>P/NF

Fig. 2 XRD diagram of Cr<sub>0.4</sub>-Co<sub>2</sub>P/NF, Co<sub>2</sub>P/NF, Cr<sub>0.3</sub>-Co<sub>2</sub>P/NF and Cr<sub>0.5</sub>-Co<sub>2</sub>P/NF.

Fig. 3 XPS spectrum of the prepared Cr<sub>0.4</sub>-Co<sub>2</sub>P/NF, Co<sub>2</sub>P/NF, Cr<sub>0.3</sub>-Co<sub>2</sub>P/NF and Cr<sub>0.5</sub>-Co<sub>2</sub>P/NF. (a) Fully scanned spectra, (b) Co 2p, (c) Cr 2p, (d) P 2p, (e) O 1s.

(Fig. 3e). The Oa peak at 533.38 eV is considered to be due to the physicochemical water that is adsorbed on the material surface, the Ov peak at 532.57 eV is considered to be an oxygen vacancy, and the Om peak at 531.36 eV is considered to be a metallic-oxygen bond. The XPS characterization further proved the successful preparation of the Cr<sub>0.4</sub>-Co<sub>2</sub>P/NF electrode. The XPS spectra of Co, Cr, P and O of the four samples were analyzed to explain the differences in the electronic structures because the fully scanned spectra were not obvious to the naked eye. Taking Co<sub>2</sub>P/NF as the benchmark, it is easy to find that the XPS peak of Cr<sub>0.4</sub>-Co<sub>2</sub>P/NF, Cr<sub>0.3</sub>-Co<sub>2</sub>P/NF and Cr<sub>0.5</sub>-Co<sub>2</sub>P/NF doped with Cr has an obvious shift, and the degree of shift is different with different doping amounts of Cr. The doping of Cr causes the XPS peak of Co to shift to the right, which redistributes the electron cloud density of Co and reduces the positive charge of Co ions in Cr<sub>0.4</sub>-Co<sub>2</sub>P, which is conducive to electron interaction and electron transfer, thus improving the activity. Similarly, the negative charges of P and O are also appropriately reduced, indicating that the doping of Cr can well regulate the electron density of the catalyst, thus improving the activity. With the increase in the doping amount, the XPS summit gradually shifts to the left, leading to a decrease in the negative charge, electron interaction and electron transfer.

The microstructure of Cr<sub>0.4</sub>-Co<sub>2</sub>P/NF was further investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As illustrated in Fig. 4a and b, clear TEM images of 100 nm and **Dalton Transactions** Paper

20 nm of Cr<sub>0.4</sub>-Co<sub>2</sub>P/NF are shown. The detailed lattice surfaces of Cr<sub>0.4</sub>-Co<sub>2</sub>P/NF were determined via high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM). The lattice spacing of this Cr<sub>0.4</sub>-Co<sub>2</sub>P/NF material is 0.188 nm, which is related to the (1 2 0) face of Co<sub>2</sub>P (Fig. 4c). The corresponding EDS elemental mapping results show that Cr, Co and P elements are present and uniformly distributed in the obtained Cr<sub>0.4</sub>-Co<sub>2</sub>P/NF catalysts (Fig. 4d). All these findings indicate that Cr was successfully incorporated into Cr<sub>0.4</sub>-Co<sub>2</sub>P/ NF.

#### 3.2. Electrocatalytic UOR performances of the materials

The UOR performance of the synthesized electrocatalyst was studied in a conventional three-electrode device in a mixture of 0.5 M urea and 1 M KOH at a scan rate of 0.005 V s<sup>-1</sup>. For the elimination of the effect of the Ni foam on the electrocatalytic performance, the UOR performance of the bare Ni foam was examined. By comparing the LSV curves of Cr<sub>0.4</sub>-Co<sub>2</sub>P/NF, Co<sub>2</sub>P/NF, Cr<sub>0.3</sub>-Co<sub>2</sub>P/NF, Cr<sub>0.5</sub>-Co<sub>2</sub>P/NF and the bare Ni foam, the catalytic performance of different materials could be acquired immediately (Fig. 5a). As displayed in Fig. 5a, it was found that the activity of the blank nickel foam was better than that of the Co<sub>2</sub>P/NF catalyst without Cr<sup>2+</sup> doping, while the activity of the catalyst with Cr2+ doping was better than that of the blank nickel foam. The activation of Crx-Co2P/NF with different Cr2+ ratios was measured using LSV, which revealed Cr<sub>0.4</sub>-Co<sub>2</sub>P/NF to be the best one. Cr<sub>0.4</sub>-Co<sub>2</sub>P/NF displays a low potential (1.333 V), which is smaller than those of  $Co_2P/NF$  (1.409 V),  $Cr_{0.3}$ - $Co_2P/NF$  (1.371 V),  $Cr_{0.5}$ - $Co_2P/NF$ (1.350 V) and the bare NF (1.382 V) to drive the 50 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> current density. And Cr<sub>0.4</sub>-Co<sub>2</sub>P/NF displays a low potential (1.362 V), which is smaller than those of Co<sub>2</sub>P/NF (1.514 V), Cr<sub>0.3</sub>-Co<sub>2</sub>P/NF (1.402 V), Cr<sub>0.5</sub>-Co<sub>2</sub>P/NF (1.392 V) and the bare NF (1.492 V) that can be driven with a current density of 100 mA cm $^{-2}$  (Fig. 5b). In Fig. S2,† it can be seen that the performance of the OER for Cr<sub>0.4</sub>-Co<sub>2</sub>P/NF is much lower than the performance of the UOR. During the water separation process, the cell voltage can be reduced by 0.206 V through the auxiliary anode of the UOR. The catalytic activity of all the acquired

materials decreased in the order  $Cr_{0.4}$ - $Co_2P/NF > Cr_{0.3}$ - $Co_2P/NF$  $> Cr_{0.5}-Co_2P/NF > NF > Co_2P/NF$ . The reaction dynamics of the catalysts was evaluated using Tafel diagrams calculated from LSV curves,  $^{47,48}$  and the following equation:  $\eta = a + b \log j$ . As illustrated in Fig. 5c, the Tafel slope of Cr-Co<sub>2</sub>P/NF is 128.8 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>, which is smaller than those of Co<sub>2</sub>P/NF (516.7 mV  $dec^{-1}$ ),  $Cr_{0.3}$ - $Co_2P/NF$  (191.1 mV  $dec^{-1}$ ) and  $Cr_{0.5}$ - $Co_2P/NF$ (211.6 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>), indicating that the Cr<sub>0.4</sub>-Co<sub>2</sub>P/NF electrode showed a promoted reaction dynamics, an enhanced charge rate of transfer and improved catalytic performance. The longterm stability test of the UOR for the Cr<sub>0.4</sub>-Co<sub>2</sub>P/NF catalyst was carried out using chronoamperometry. As illustrated in Fig. 5d, the current density remained almost constant with slight fluctuations after 12 hours, indicating that the activity of the UOR for the Cr<sub>0.4</sub>-Co<sub>2</sub>P/NF electrocatalyst was relatively stable. To further investigate the effect of the degree of Cr doping on the electrocatalytic activity, the electrocatalytically active surface area of the electrodes was studied using the double-layer capacitance method (Fig. S3†). According to the literature, the more the catalytic centers on the outer surface of the electrocatalyst were exhibited, the more reactive species were adsorbed and the greater the performance of the electrode was. The larger the electrocatalytically active surface area

Paper **Dalton Transactions** 

was, the more the catalytic centers were exposed and the better the electrochemical activity of the catalyst was. As shown in Fig. 5e, the  $C_{\rm dl}$  of  $Cr_{0.4}$ - $Co_2P/NF$  shows a relatively high capacitance of 5.12 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>, which is much more than the 0.36 mF cm<sup>-2</sup> for Co<sub>2</sub>P/NF, 2.41 mF cm<sup>-2</sup> for Cr<sub>0.3</sub>-Co<sub>2</sub>P/NF and  $4.35~\mathrm{mF~cm}^{-2}$  for  $\mathrm{Cr_{0.5}\text{-}Co_2P/NF}$ . This indicates that the doping of Cr leads to more electrochemically active sites, resulting in a much larger electrocatalytically active surface area of Cr<sub>0.4</sub>-Co<sub>2</sub>P/NF nanoarrays. Accordingly, the analysis of the experimental results indicates that the excellent UOR activity of the Cr<sub>0.4</sub>-Co<sub>2</sub>P/NF catalyst can be ascribed to the fast electron transfer rate, increased electrocatalytic active surface area, greater exposure of active sites, and concerted catalytic effect of Cr doping. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was employed to analyze the electrical conductivity of these materials, as depicted in Fig. 5f. The charge transfer resistance measured at 0.3 V for Cr<sub>0.4</sub>-Co<sub>2</sub>P/NF is obviously much lower than those of Co<sub>2</sub>P/NF, Cr<sub>0.3</sub>-Co<sub>2</sub>P/NF and Cr<sub>0.5</sub>-Co<sub>2</sub>P/NF, which provides further confirmation of the increased electrocatalytic dynamics of Cr<sub>0.4</sub>-Co<sub>2</sub>P/NF, which also indicates that the Cr<sub>0.4</sub>-Co<sub>2</sub>P/NF material has excellent metallic properties and great electrical conductivity. In addition, a comparison with the disclosed efficient electrolytic urea materials is presented (Fig. S4†), and the results suggest that the Cr<sub>0.4</sub>-Co<sub>2</sub>P/NF electrode may exhibit the most optimal electrocatalytic activities reported so far in the electrolysis of urea.

#### Stability analysis of Cr<sub>0.4</sub>-Co<sub>2</sub>P/NF

The stability of the prepared material is one of the important indicators for judging the performance of electrocatalysts. In order to further investigate the stability of Cr<sub>0.4</sub>-Co<sub>2</sub>P/NF in the electrolysis of urea, SEM, XRD and XPS tests were performed on the Cr-Co<sub>2</sub>P/NF catalysts after 12 h of electrochemical testing. As can be seen from the SEM images, after 12 h of electrochemical testing, the shape of the catalyst changed marginally under the corrosion effect under alkaline conditions, and the nanoneedle array underwent a partial detachment (Fig. S5c and d†). From the XRD images, it was found that no new diffraction peaks appeared in the XRD of the catalyst after 12 hours of electrochemical testing, and there was no significant change in the intensity of the diffraction peaks and no formation of new material (Fig. 6). It can be seen from the XPS images that the Cr<sub>0.4</sub>-Co<sub>2</sub>P/NF catalyst was employed in the truly active state in the decomposition of urea. As illustrated in Fig. 7a, the decrease in the strength of the characteristic peak due to the loss of some active components after the 12 h stability test indicates that a slight change in the catalyst occurs only in terms of the ingredient content and not in terms of the chemical composition. In the XPS spectra of Co 2p (Fig. 7b), the characteristic peak moves towards the direction of low binding energy, and the characteristic peak of Co-P bond changes significantly. This same phenomenon has been found in previously published studies of transition metal phosphides for the electrocatalytic decomposition of water, 49,50 and the transition metal phosphorus bond (Co-P) may be related to the catalytically active center. For both fresh and recovered Cr

2p (Fig. 7c), the doped Cr was shed during the decomposition of urea, resulting in a decrease in the intensity of its characteristic peak. In the XPS spectrum of P 2p (Fig. 7d), the characteristic peaks of P 2p<sub>1/2</sub> and 2p<sub>3/2</sub> disappeared, demonstrating that the Cr<sub>0.4</sub>-Co<sub>2</sub>P/NF catalyst was fully oxidized during the electrolysis of urea. As shown in the XPS spectra of O 1s (Fig. 7e), the peak intensities of Oa and Om decrease and the peak intensity of Ov increases, indicating that the metaloxygen bond gradually disappears with the electrolysis of urea

and leaves some oxygen vacancies. For the reasons mentioned above, some slight changes will not affect the superior activity of the UOR.

#### 3.4 Density functional theory calculation

**Dalton Transactions** 

For the sake of revealing the mechanism of electrolysis of urea for Cr-doped Co<sub>2</sub>P materials, the energy of urea adsorption  $(\Delta G_{\text{urea}^*}$  for urea adsorption in an alkaline medium) was calculated using density functional theory. Fig. 8a-c show the ball and stick models for Cr<sub>0.3</sub>-Co<sub>2</sub>P, Cr<sub>0.4</sub>-Co<sub>2</sub>P and Cr<sub>0.5</sub>-Co<sub>2</sub>P. It is obvious from Fig. 8a-c that individual urea molecules are adsorbed on the surface of each material and are strongly adsorbed on the surface of Cr active sites. A continuous substitution of the Cr site was performed to calculate the adsorption energy for urea. However, the adsorption model that replaced the four chromes was unstable, resulting in the failure of the calculation. The urea adsorption energy of each material is shown in Fig. 8d. The urea adsorption energy of Cr<sub>0.4</sub>-Co<sub>2</sub>P was -1.42 eV, which was higher than those of  $Cr_{0.3}$ - $Co_2P$  (-1.28 eV) and Cr<sub>0.5</sub>-Co<sub>2</sub>P (-0.99 eV), respectively, indicating that Cr<sub>0.4</sub>-Co<sub>2</sub>P showed the best adsorption energy of urea in the electrolysis of urea. Moreover, as shown in Fig. 8e, the density of states (DOS) around the Fermi energy level of Cr<sub>0.4</sub>-Co<sub>2</sub>P was higher than those of Cr<sub>0.3</sub>-Co<sub>2</sub>P and Cr<sub>0.5</sub>-Co<sub>2</sub>P, indicating that the Cr<sub>0.4</sub>-Co<sub>2</sub>P material has a better conductivity in electrocata-

lysis, which also proves that the  $Cr_{0.4}$ - $Co_2P$  material will exhibit excellent catalytic activity. In addition, Fig. S6† shows the partial density of states per atom in the  $Cr_{0.3}$ - $Co_2P$ ,  $Cr_{0.4}$ - $Co_2P$  and  $Cr_{0.5}$ - $Co_2P$  materials. It is worth noting that the main electron cloud distribution of  $Cr_{0.3}$ - $Co_2P$ ,  $Cr_{0.4}$ - $Co_2P$  and  $Cr_{0.5}$ - $Co_2P$  consists of Co-d orbitals, P-p orbitals and Cr-d orbitals. According to the above analysis, the moderate doping of Cr modulates the electronic structure and increases the conductivity and urea adsorption energy, thus significantly improving the urea oxidation performance of the electrode.

# 4. Conclusion

To sum up the above, Cr-doped Co<sub>2</sub>P nanoneedle arrays were successfully synthesized on 3D porous Ni foam substrates by a hydrothermal process and a low-temperature phosphorization process. The prepared Cr<sub>0.4</sub>-Co<sub>2</sub>P/NF exhibited an efficient UOR activity requiring only a low cell voltage of 1.333 V to provide a current density of 50 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> in 1 M KOH containing a 0.5 M urea alkaline medium. The analysis of the experimental results indicated that the comparatively greater activity of Cr<sub>0.4</sub>-Co<sub>2</sub>P/NF materials is attributed to the more active site exposure, larger active surface area, fast reaction kinetics and a moderate amount of Cr doping that significantly modulates the electronic structure of the electrocatalyst. DFT shows that the generated Cr<sub>0.4</sub>-doped Co<sub>2</sub>P has the best urea sorption energy as compared with Co2P, which is a guide for the industrialization of the electrolysis of urea. It also provides guidance for the reasonable design of 3D, inexpensive, and highly efficient electrode materials.

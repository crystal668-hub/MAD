Replacing the high theoretical potential of anodic water decomposition (oxygen evolution reaction) with the low theoretical potential of urea oxidation reaction (UOR) is an urgent need for hydrogen energy storage and conversion. Cobalt nitride nanoflakes, high-performance bifunctional catalysts supported on nickel foam ( $Co_{5.47}N$  NF/NF), were synthesized by hydrothermal and calcination method. The morphology and composition of the catalyst were studied by XRD, XPS, SEM, TEM, HRTEM and elemental analysis. In order to conduct electrochemical performance and stability, a two-electrode electrolyzer composed of  $Co_{5.47}N$  NF/NF as both anode and cathode materials is constructed ( $Co_{5.47}N$  NF/NF)| $Co_{5.47}N$  NF/NF). Only a voltage of 1.687 V is needed to complete 100 mA  $\cdot$  cm<sup>-2</sup>. It is much lower than the voltage of Pt/C||IrO<sub>2</sub> (1.816 V), because of which it is believed that this work provides a valuable route for the design of inexpensive and efficient urea electrolysis-assisted hydrogen generation.

Keywords: Bifunctional; urea; hydrogen; energy storage.

### 1. Introduction

The rapid depletion of fossil fuel resources gives rise to a big demand for clean and renewable energy.<sup>1–4</sup> As a kind of green energy (high energy without secondary pollution), hydrogen energy is widely considered as an ideal energy to replace fossil energy.<sup>5–9</sup> Recently, the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) of water electrolysis has been considered as the most effective hydrogen production method.<sup>10–12</sup> But, the anode of water electrolysis to produce hydrogen is oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which has a high theoretical oxidation potential, which greatly limits the generation of hydrogen.<sup>13–15</sup> So, it is of great significance for

hydrogen economy to select urea oxidation reaction (UOR) with lower potential theoretically. 10,12

Meanwhile, urine-caused water pollution has become a challenging environmental issue. <sup>16,17</sup> Urine includes urea, and it can be converted into ammonia and nitrogen compounds, which will cause pollution to the atmospheric environment. <sup>18</sup> Theoretically, urea has a standard potential of 0.37 V at the anode relative to reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) [Eq. (1)]. Water is reduced at the cathode at 0 V versus RHE [Eq. (2)] in alkaline media. Then a lower theoretical potential for urea electrolysis under standard conditions is obtained [Eq. (3)]. <sup>19–21</sup> The wastewater-urea pollution issues can be

<span id="page-1-0"></span>effectively solved by electrolysis. Therefore, urea electrolysis has become of interest in recent years due to its advantages in energy and the environment.<sup>18,22–24</sup> It is feasible in wastewater treatment and is also significant for efficient and energy efficient hydrogen production.

However, the six-electron transfer process severely limits the kinetic reaction of anodization. Urea electrolysis still faces challenges of high potential and low activity. Currently, the most advanced electrocatalysts for UOR include Pt and Rh.<sup>25,26</sup> However, the cost of the precious metal catalyst used is too high, which largely limits the commercialization of urea electrolysis technology. Therefore, it is necessary to find low-cost, nonpolluting, high UOR activity and stability of nonprecious metals to replace precious metals. In this study, high-performance nonnoble metal Co<sub>5.47</sub>N nanoflakes were prepared on Ni foam (Co<sub>5.47</sub>N NF/ NF). In the first step, precursor CoO nanoflakes on Ni foam (CoO NF/NF) were successfully synthesized by hydrothermal method. The second step is the synthesis of  $Co_{5.47}N$  NF/NF. I obtained the final product by placing CoO NF/NF in a tube furnace for calcination. Thanks to the regular array of nanostructures, high activity of UOR with potentials of only 1.431 V and  $100 \,\mathrm{mA}\cdot\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$  is obtained. More importantly, this  $Co_{5.47}N$  can be used as a bifunctional catalyst for UOR and HER for largescale hydrogen production, and only 1.348 V is required to realize  $10 \,\mathrm{mA}\cdot\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$ . As shown in Fig. 1,

the prepared catalyst is used as an electrode, which is an array of nanoflakes grown on a Ni foam substrate. During electrolysis, nitrogen and carbon dioxide will be released as urea is absorbed and diffused.

### 2. Experimental

### 2.1. Reagents

Cobalt (II) chloride hexahydrate ( $CoCl_2 \cdot 6H_2O$ ), potassium hydroxide (KOH), urea and hexamethylenetetramine are all purchased from Sinopharm chemical reagent co., ltd (www.sinoreagent.com). 20 wt.% Pt/C and 20 wt.% iridium were purchased from Shaanxi Kaida Chemical Engineering Co., Ltd. Nickel foam was purchased from Shenzhen Green Creative Environment Technology Co., Ltd. All chemicals are used as is without further purification.

# 2.2. Synthesis of $Co_{5.47}N$ nanoflakes on nickel foam $(Co_{5.47}N NF/NF)$

In a typical procedure, 4 mmol CoCl<sub>2</sub> · 6H<sub>2</sub>O and 12 mmol hexamethylenetetramine were dissolved in 50 mL distilled water and stirred to form a clear solution. Then the above solution and a piece of cleaned NF  $(2 \, \text{cm} \times 3 \, \text{cm})$  were transferred to a 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and maintained at 100°C for 10 h. After the autoclave cooled down naturally, the resulting NF was taken out and washed with distilled water and ethanol, followed by drying 2 h at 60°C to obtain CoO NF/ NF. To prepare Co<sub>5.47</sub>N NF/NF, CoO NF/NF was placed in a tube furnace, and heated at 350°C for 2 h with a heating speed of 1°C min<sup>-1</sup> in NH<sub>3</sub> atmosphere, and then naturally cooled to ambient temperature under NH<sub>3</sub>. Finally, the black Co<sub>5 47</sub>N NF/ NF were collected for further characterization.

## <span id="page-2-0"></span>2.3. Characterization

Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images were taken from JEOL 7001 SEM instruments at 3 kV. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) images were obtained from Sitecna aig2t20 at 200 kv. The sample preparation method is to scrape o® the Ni foam directly. On Bruker D8 ADVANCE ECO powder X-ray apparatus, X-ray di®raction (XRD) patterns were obtained using copper K radiation ( ¼ 0:15418 nm) in the range of 2 from 25 to 70 with a scanning step size of 0.01. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were made using an electron spectrometer.

## 2.4. Electrochemical measurements

Electrochemical measurements were performed on a CHI 660E electrochemical workstation with a standard three-electrode system. The prepared electrode material is directly used as a working electrode. The reference electrode was HgO/Hg (MOE) and the counter electrode was graphite rod. The electrolyte of water-urea electrolysis system is 1 M KOH with 0.5 M urea. All of the measured potentials were converted to RHE according to the Nernst equation (ERHE ¼ EHg=HgO þ 0:098þ 0:059 pH). Electrochemical tests were conducted at a scanning rate of 5 mV/s under infrared compensation. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is performed at a frequency of 1–1,000,000.

### 3. Results and Discussion

Figure 2(a) displays the XRD of Co5:47N NF/ NF. The di®raction peaks at 43.62, 50.77 and 74.86 correspond to (111), (200) and (220) lattice, respectively, belong to Co5:47N (JCPDS 41-0943). The peaks at 44.47, 51.79 and 76.59 correspond to Ni (JCPDS 04-0850), which is due to the substrate. No additional peaks were found, which means high purity Co5:47N NF/NF. The peak value of CoO NF/NF can also be well indexed by the standard card in Fig. [S1](#page-8-0). The surface composition and electron binding energy of Co5:47N NF/NF were

<span id="page-3-0"></span>characterized by XPS. Figure [2\(](#page-2-0)b) shows two characteristic peaks of CO2 at 779.5 eV and 795.1 eV, which can be designated as Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2.[27](#page-8-0) The peak of N1 is shown in Fig. [2](#page-2-0)(c). Obviously, the peaks of 397.5 eV and 399.9 eV are related to nitrogen-cobalt and nitrogen-oxygen.[28,29](#page-8-0) And the chemical composition of Co5:47N was measured in Table [S1](#page-9-0). The at.% of C, N and Co were 23.77%, 11.92% and 64.31%, respectively.

The morphology of the catalyst was observed by SEM. From the low magni¯cation [Fig. 3(a)], we can clearly observe that the nanosheet array is regularly and evenly distributed on the surface of the nickel foam substrate [Fig. [S2\(](#page-9-0)a)]. From the high magni¯cation [Fig. 3(b)], we can see that the layers are °u®y and °exible. SEM images of CoO NF/NF show that the Ni foam is completely covered by the CoO nanosheet array in Fig. [S2](#page-9-0)(b). Figure 3(c) shows the TEM images of individual sheets of Co5:47N NF/NF. Meanwhile, its loose sheet-array morphology is observed. Figure 3(d) displays highresolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) of Co5:47N NF/NF, which reveals highresolution lattice fringes with plane spacings of 0.18 nm and 0.21 nm corresponding to Co5:47N NF/ NF (200) and (111). The resulting spacing values are consistent with that of the XRD. Element mapping reveals that cobalt [Fig. 3(e)] and nitrogen

[Fig. 3(f)] are uniformly distributed in the sheet electrocatalyst. This means that cobalt nitride nanoflakes are successfully prepared on Ni foam.

Based on these observations of physical characterization, I focused our study on the catalytic UOR activities of  $Co_{5.47}N$  NF/NF (loading: 0.23 mg/cm<sup>2</sup>) by electrochemical experiments. The commercial IrO<sub>2</sub> (20 wt.%) was also evaluated for comparison and the most suitable urea concentration is screened as 0.5 M (Fig. S3). Figure 4(a) displays LSV of Co<sub>5,47</sub>N NF/NF in different electrolytes. At  $100 \,\mathrm{mA \cdot cm^{-2}}$ , only a potential of 1.431 V is required to drive a current density of  $100 \,\mathrm{mA}\cdot\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$ in 1 M KOH with 0.5 M Urea (UOR). While a potential of OER (in 1 M KOH) is 1.763 V. Obviously, the potential of UOR is lower than that of OER, which indicates that UOR activity is better than OER activity. At  $10 \,\mathrm{mA}\cdot\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$ , the potentials of Co<sub>5.47</sub>N NF/NF, CoO NF/NF, IrO<sub>2</sub> and NF are 1.345 V, 1.366 V, 1.576 V and 1.602 V, respectively. It is clear that the potential of Co<sub>5,47</sub>N NF/NF is the lowest, indicating that UOR activity of Co<sub>5 47</sub>N NF/ NF is better than other substances from Fig. 4(b). The Tafel curve can be used to explain the catalytic kinetics of the electrode.<sup>21</sup> The Tafel slopes of  $\text{Co}_{5.47}\text{N}$  NF/NF, CoO NF/NF and IrO<sub>2</sub> are  $47 \,\mathrm{mV} \cdot \mathrm{dec^{-1}}$ ,  $60 \,\mathrm{mV} \cdot \mathrm{dec^{-1}}$  and  $78 \,\mathrm{mV} \cdot \mathrm{dec^{-1}}$ , respectively [Fig. 4(c)]. It is clear that the Tafel slope of  $Co_{5.47}N$  NF/NF is the lowest, which means that it has fast kinetics and excellent UOR catalytic activity. 30 At the same time, the stability of Co<sub>5 47</sub>N NF/NF was also evaluated in this study. A multistep chronopotentiometric curve of Co<sub>5 47</sub>N NF/NF was obtained [Fig. 4(d)]. A staircase potential is applied to Co<sub>5.47</sub>N NF/NF electrode from 1.35 V up to  $1.46\,\mathrm{V}$  with an increment of  $11\,\mathrm{mV}\cdot\mathrm{per}\ 2\,\mathrm{h}$ . At the starting current value, the potential immediately levels off and remains constant for the remaining 2 h, especially at higher current. The fast chronopotentiometric response implies excellent mass transport. The photograph [inset in Fig. 4(d)] shows the escaping of massive small bubbles from

the electrode, indicating easy release of  $N_2$  and  $CO_2$  from the catalyst surface. These results indicate that  $Co_{5.47}N$  NF/NF has excellent mass transportation, conductivity and mechanical robustness (inward diffusion of OH and outwards diffusion of bubbles and fast response to current density in each potential change step),<sup>31,32</sup> and the current density after 3000 CV cycles was 93.8% of the original (Fig. S4). At the same time, the peak value of XRD is almost the same as that before 3000 CV cycles, and it matches well with the standard card (Fig. S5). These results show that it has excellent stability.

I further studied the electrochemical performance of  $\mathrm{Co}_{5.47}\mathrm{N}$  NF/NF on the cathode HER for urea electrolysis. Figure 5(a) displays LSV of  $\mathrm{Co}_{5.47}\mathrm{N}$  NF/NF in different electrolytes. At the same current density, the potential difference between the electrolyte containing urea and the electrolyte without urea is very small. The results show that with or without urea in the potassium hydroxide solution has no effect on HER activity. Figure 5(b)

shows LSV of the prepared catalyst. To require  $10 \,\mathrm{mA \cdot cm^{-2}}$ , the potentials of  $\mathrm{Co}_{5.47}\mathrm{N}\ \mathrm{NF/NF}$ , CoO NF/NF, Pt/C and NF are 116 mV, 211 mV, 39 mV and 248 mV, respectively. The overpotential of Co<sub>5.47</sub>N NF/NF is closest to the overpotential of Pt/C. The overpotential of bare NF was the worst, and the overpotential of  $Co_{5.47}N$  NF/NF was close to Pt/C, indicating that the catalytic activity of Co<sub>5 47</sub>N NF/NF was close to Pt/C and the EIS of prepared catalysts also shows the same phenomenon (Fig. S6). The Tafel slopes of Pt/C, Co<sub>5,47</sub>N NF/ NF, CoO NF/NF and NF are  $45 \,\mathrm{mV} \cdot \mathrm{dec}^{-1}$  $122 \,\mathrm{mV} \cdot \mathrm{dec^{-1}}$ ,  $163 \,\mathrm{mV} \cdot \mathrm{dec^{-1}}$  and  $196 \,\mathrm{mV} \cdot \mathrm{dec^{-1}}$ , respectively [Fig. 5(c)]. Obviously, the Tafel slope of  $Co_{5.47}N$  NF/NF is the closest to Pt/C, which demonstrates that it performs efficiently for HER and the route following the Heyrovsky mechanism  $(H_2O + H * + e^- \rightarrow H_2\uparrow + OH^-)$ , where H\* represents hydrogen atom adsorbed on the surface of the catalyst.<sup>33,34</sup> In addition, the chronoamperometric response of  $Co_{5.47}N$  NF/NF was measured at  $10 \,\mathrm{mA \cdot cm^{-2}}$  and  $50 \,\mathrm{mA \cdot cm^{-2}}$  [Fig. 5(d)]. All

duration tests show that it has excellent stability for at least 22 h.

Based on the excellent thermal stability and UOR performance of  $\mathrm{Co}_{5.47}\mathrm{N}$  NF/NF electrode, its applicability as a bifunctional urea electrolysis catalyst was determined. Therefore, an electrolytic having  $\mathrm{Co}_{5.47}\mathrm{N}$  NF/NF as anode and cathode

(Co<sub>5.47</sub>N NF/NF||Co<sub>5.47</sub>N NF/NF) was conducted in 1.0 M KOH with 0.5 M urea. Iridium dioxide was used as cathode and platinum carbon as anode (Pt/C||IrO<sub>2</sub>) for comparison. Figure 6(a) represents LSVs of Co<sub>5.47</sub>N NF/NF||Co<sub>5.47</sub>N NF/NF. The voltage of Co<sub>5.47</sub>N NF/NF||Co<sub>5.47</sub>N NF/NF in 1 M KOH with 0.5 M urea is 1.687 V at 100 mA  $\cdot$  cm<sup>-2</sup>.

<span id="page-7-0"></span>While that in 1 M KOH is 2.006 V. It is clearly that the voltage of urea electrolysis is lower than that of water electrolysis, which implies that urea electrolysis has a higher catalytic activity than that of water electrolysis. Figure 6(b) displays LSVs of  $Co_{5.47}N NF/NF||Co_{5.47}N NF/NF and Pt/C||IrO_2.$ Co<sub>5.47</sub>N NF/NF||Co<sub>5.47</sub>N NF/NF requires voltages of 1.597 V and 1.687 V to obtain  $50 \,\mathrm{mA}\cdot\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$  and  $100\,\mathrm{mA\cdot cm^{-2}}$ . While  $\mathrm{Pt/C}||\mathrm{IrO_2}|$  requires higher voltages of 1.681 V and 1.816 V. The results show that Co<sub>5,47</sub>N NF/NF||Co<sub>5,47</sub>N NF/NF electrolyzer has better performance than Pt/C||IrO<sub>2</sub> electrolyzer. At the same time, comparing the electrochemical activity of materials in recent literature,  $Co_{5.47}N$  NF/NF is better than other materials (Table 1). In addition, the timing current measurement under 1.69 V in urea electrolysis indicates that Co<sub>5.47</sub>N NF/NF||Co<sub>5.47</sub>N NF/NF can continue electrolysis for at least 20 h at a higher current density  $[100 \,\mathrm{mA \cdot cm^{-2}}; \,\mathrm{Fig.} \,6(c)], \,\mathrm{which} \,\mathrm{demon-}$ strates its high stability. The inset of Fig. 6(c) shows the fluctuation of current density around the 15th hours, which may be caused by the accumulation and release of the remaining bubbles on the electrode surface. 35,36

#### 4. Conclusion

In this paper, a simple and low-cost method was used to synthesize high-performance nonnoble metal nickel nitride electrocatalyst supported on nickel foam (Co<sub>5,47</sub>N NF/NF) for high-efficiency urea electrolysis-assisted hydrogen generation and exhibits excellent UOR performance. When the current density is  $10 \,\mathrm{mA}\cdot\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$ , the potential reaches  $1.345\,\mathrm{V}$ . This  $\mathrm{Co}_{5.47}\mathrm{N}$  NF/NF also shows high activity to HER, requiring only 116 mV at  $10\,\mathrm{mA\cdot cm^{-2}}$  due to the Heyrovsky mechanism. This indicates that Co<sub>5.47</sub>N NF/NF is an excellent bifunctional catalyst for overall urea electrolysis. Therefore, the two-electrode electrolyzer was conducted to explore catalytic characteristics. Only needs  $1.348 \,\mathrm{V}$  to drive  $10 \,\mathrm{mA} \cdot \mathrm{cm}^{-2}$ , which is  $0.2 \,\mathrm{V}$ lower than water electrolysis, and can continue electrolysis for at least 20 hours at a higher current density (100 mA  $\cdot$  cm<sup>-2</sup>). Therefore, the Co<sub>5.47</sub>N NF/NF electrode has excellent performance in a complete urea electrolysis. It has great potential in replacing precious metals with high activity and stability and effectively treating industrial wastewater containing urea. There comes a promising strategy for environmentally compatible flexible urea conversion and energy storage applications.

# Three-dimensional cross-linked Co-MoS<sub>2</sub> catalyst on carbon cloth for efficient hydrogen evolution reaction<sup>†</sup>

Yan Xiao, Jing Yao, Tianze Zhang, Xinzhi Ma, Dexin Xu and Hong Gao 🗅 \*

MoS<sub>2</sub>-Based materials are promising hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalysts. However, their HER activities are restrained by the poor population of HER activated edge centers, the large area exposed HER inert basal planes, and low conductivity. Fixing these problems on one system is an effective strategy, but it remains a challenge due to the harsh synthetic conditions. Herein, cobalt carbonate hydroxide (CoCH) nanosheets were used as the substrate for preparing a three-dimensional self-supported cross-linked (3DSC) Co-MoS<sub>2</sub> nanostructured HER catalyst, which possesses abundant active centers and fast electronic transfer ability. In addition, Co activates the basal-plane sulfur atom in MoS<sub>2</sub> to be the HER reactive center effectively. Benefiting from these advantages, 3DSC Co-MoS<sub>2</sub> electrode integrated on carbon cloth (CC) shows that it can drive the current density of 10 and 100 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> with only 40 and 119 mV overpotentials, respectively, which is superior to other MoS<sub>2</sub>-based HER catalysts reported recently. This research provides a facile strategy for the improvement of efficient HER electrocatalysts.

## Introduction

With the development of human society, the increase in energy consumption has brought about a scarcity of nonrenewable resources, accompanied by environmental problems such as global warming.1-3 Hydrogen energy has broad development prospects due to its cleanliness, renewability, and high gravimetric energy density characteristics.<sup>4,5</sup> Electrochemical water splitting is the first choice for largescale clean hydrogen production among many hydrogen production methods because of its direct and clean fashion.<sup>6-8</sup> Choosing a suitable catalyst can make the process more efficient. However, as the best-performing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalyst, Pt-based is expensive and has small reserves, severely restricting industrial hydrogen production's extensive application. 9,10 Therefore, it is necessary to develop highly efficient and inexpensive electrocatalysts to satisfy universal applications.

In recent years, researchers have been working to find highly efficient, durable non-precious metal electrocatalysts, such as transition metal phosphides, 11 sulfides, 12,13 car-

bides,  $^{14}$  nitrides,  $^{15}$  and oxides.  $^{16,17}$  Among these catalysts, transition metal sulfides have been extensively studied in HER due to their abundant resources, low prices, and unique electronic structures.  $^{18}$  In particular, molybdenum disulfide (MoS<sub>2</sub>) has acquired tremendous interest because the hydrogen adsorption Gibbs free energy ( $\Delta G_{\rm H}$ ) at the edge sites of MoS<sub>2</sub> nanosheets is very close to that of adsorption and conversion of hydrogen-related substances, which makes it an ideal HER catalyst to substitute precious-metal catalysts.  $^{19,20}$  However, compared with fewer edge sites, the larger exposed basal planes of the MoS<sub>2</sub> material are HER inert, and the conductivity is unsatisfactory, which together hinder its practical applications.  $^{21-24}$ 

To develop an advanced MoS<sub>2</sub>-based HER catalyst, it is highly desired to expose many active centers, and create new reactive centers by activating the inactive sites.<sup>25</sup> Based on these considerations, researchers mainly focus on the following three optimization strategies: (1) Boosting the intrinsic catalytic activity of the catalyst. The results of many studies show that the doping of transition metal elements can effectively change the electronic structure to improve the HER activity of the material.<sup>26–30</sup> Liu *et al.* constructed a theoretical physical model, where Fe, Co, Cu, and Ni atoms were employed as single dopants. They demonstrated that the doped transition-metal atoms can connect themselves with S atoms, and this S atom is the most active site for hydrogen bonding, thus contributing to the activation of the inert basal planes in MoS<sub>2</sub>.<sup>31</sup> Attanayake's group confirmed the correct-

ness of this view by both theoretical and experimental results. They found that introducing Co (Ni) in the inert plane of MoS<sub>2</sub> can reduce the  $\Delta G_{\rm H}$  and promote water separation. These advantages endow MoS2 excellent HER activity in the alkaline medium.<sup>32</sup> Therefore, the introduction of transition metals can improve the limitation of inert substrates toward the intrinsic activity of MoS2. (2) Augmenting the number of superior active centers on the edges. The three-dimensional (3D) structure is advantageous for increasing the exposed edge sites, such as nanospheres, nanoclusters, nanotubes, and nanoflowers. Li et al. developed MoS2 nanoflowers with 210-470 nm diameter constructed by small nanosheets. The catalyst exhibited enhanced catalytic activity and was superior to commercial MoS<sub>2</sub>.<sup>33</sup> The classical structure allows MoS<sub>2</sub> to expose a lot of unsaturated sulfur edges, 33 which are closely related to the HER performance. Based on this advantage, Ho's team designed an architectural MoS2 nanotubes array. This strategy maximizes the per unit geometric area, which contributed to the exposure of a large number of active centers on the edges.<sup>34</sup> Therefore, the construction of 3D structures has become the primary strategy to synthesize nanostructures with a high density of the active edges. (3) Establishing easy electron transfer system. The self-supported electrode structure is more attractive than the traditional coated powdery modality because it can provide a facile pathway for electron transfer and a more robust mechanical capability. These advantages make it an ideal electrode with better kinetics and stability.<sup>35</sup> Also, a self-supported electrode system can also afford the integration of various catalytic centers.35,36 For example, Tang's group developed a unique self-supported hierarchical MoS<sub>2</sub>/ CoS<sub>2</sub> nanotubes array, wherein the classical hierarchical and nanotube array structure endowed the electrode with a low Tafel slope of 34 mV dec<sup>-1</sup> and excellent durability of more than 72 hours.<sup>37</sup> Though these strategies have been employed individually or in combination for preparing high efficiency MoS<sub>2</sub>-based HER catalysts, the integration of three approaches in one system has been less reported, which may be due to the harsh synthetic environment. Thus, an electrode that meets the overall needs of excellent catalytic ability, several reactive centers, good electrical conductivity, and a robust structural integrity can be achieved by purposefully adjusting only the morphology.

Herein, a 3D self-supported cross-linked (3DSC) Co-contained  $MoS_2$  (Co- $MoS_2$ ) nanostructured HER catalyst was synthesized on carbon cloth (CC) via a hydrothermal method, followed by an in situ grafting process. Benefiting from the unique structure,  $MoS_2$  nanosheets obtain rivets and uniformly disperse, thus exposing abundant active centers on the edges and resulting in a more suitable environment for ion transfer and bubble release. On the other hand, the unique structure also strengthens the durability and accelerates electron transfer by direct bonding with CC. In addition, the Co element in  $MoS_2$  improves the overall conductivity to provide an easy path for electron transfer and successfully activates the adjacent S sites to respond to HER. As a result, the 3DSC Co- $MoS_2$ -4/CC prepared using the cobalt carbonate hydroxide

(CoCH) nanosheets prepared with 4 mmol reagent as the basis shows the most significantly improved HER response and durability. It needs only 40 and 119 mV overpotential to drive the current density of 10 and 100 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> in 1 M KOH, respectively. In addition, it can drive the current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> for 24 hours without any structural changes. This work provides a facile strategy for integrating the exposure of the active centers, conductivity improvement, and durability in one system.

## Experimental

#### Synthesis of the CoCH/CC nanosheet

Before synthesis, CC (WOS1009) was dipped in a 3 M HNO<sub>3</sub> aqueous solution and placed in a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave, which was treated in an oven at 90 °C overnight. All the CoCH precursor nanosheets were collectively referred to as CoCH/CC.  $\text{Co(NO_3)}_2\text{·}6\text{H}_2\text{O}$  (1 mmol; 4 mmol; 8 mmol) and urea (5 mmol; 20 mmol; 40 mmol) were dissolved in 25 mL DI water and stirred for 30 min. A 2 × 2 cm² piece of CC and the pink solution were transferred into a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and treated at 120 °C for 360 min. The prepared sample was washed with DI water and dried under vacuum overnight. They were named as CoCH-1/CC, CoCH-4/CC, and CoCH-8/CC, respectively.

#### Synthesis of the Co-MoS<sub>2</sub>/CC composites

All samples introduced with Co elements are collectively referred to as Co-MoS<sub>2</sub>/CC. Firstly,  $(NH_4)_6Mo_7O_{24}\cdot 4H_2O$  (0.6 mmol) and thiourea (18.7 mmol) were dissolved in 25 mL DI water and stirred vigorously for 0.5 h. Subsequently, the mixture and prepared CoCH/CC samples were transferred to a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave. After heating to 200 °C and maintaining for 480 min, the autoclave was cooled to room temperature naturally. The resulting product was alternately rinsed, and then dried in a vacuum overnight. Finally, the products were annealed for 90 min at 350 °C under a 100 sccm Ar atmosphere with a heating rate of 5 °C min<sup>-1</sup> to obtain the Co-MoS<sub>2</sub>-1/CC, Co-MoS<sub>2</sub>-4/CC, and Co-MoS<sub>2</sub>-8/CC samples.

#### Characterization

X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns (D/max 2600, Rigaku, Japan) were used to characterize the material's crystal structure. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi SU70, Japan) was employed to study the morphology. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) was used to attain the elemental mapping images of the materials. The interior structure of the catalysts was studied using transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Tecnai TF20, FEI). A confocal Raman spectrometer was employed for Raman measurement (HORIBA Jobin Yvon LabRAM HR800 Evolution). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermofisher Scientific Company) was used to analyze the surface chemical state of the substances. The binding ener-

gies were calibrated according to the C 1s binding energy (284.8 eV).

#### **Electrochemical measurements**

All electrochemical tests were performed under a standard three-electrode set up using a VMP3 (France) electrochemical workstation, wherein Hg/HgO (1 M KOH) was used as the reference electrode, and 1 × 1 cm<sup>2</sup> Co-MoS<sub>2</sub>-4/CC and graphite rod were used as the working and counter electrodes, respectively.

Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was measured to study the HER performance at the rate of 2 mV s<sup>-1</sup> in 1 M KOH electrolyte. All the measured potentials were converted into reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) potential using the following formula.

$$E_{(RHE)} = E_{(Hg/HgO)} + 0.098 + 0.059 \times pH$$

The Tafel slopes were acquired from the LSV plots. The stabilities of these catalysts were assessed by carrying out cyclic voltammetry (CV) for 2000 cycles at a scan rate of 100 mV s<sup>-1</sup>. Chronopotentiometry tests were conducted at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> in HER condition. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was carried out at a polarization voltage of -200 mV vs. RHE in 1 M KOH electrolyte in the frequency range from 10 mHz to 100 kHz using the bias voltage of 10 mV. The electrochemical double-layer capacitance  $(C_{dl})$  was calculated from the CV curves. The CV plots were measured in the scan rate range of 5 to 30 mV s<sup>-1</sup> in the non-faradaic potential range of 0.364-0.464 V vs. RHE. The electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) can be obtained by dividing the  $C_{\rm dl}$  by the specific capacitance  $(C_{\rm s})$ ;  $C_{\rm s}$  was assumed to be 0.04 mF cm<sup>-2</sup> in this study.

## Results and discussion

The preparation procedure of 3DCS Co-MoS<sub>2</sub>/CC can be divided into two steps. As shown in Fig. 1, CoCH nanosheets grow on CC through a hydrothermal method in the first step. The color of the CC changed from grey to pink after the growth process of the CoCH nanosheets. In the first hydrothermal step, urea is a very weak Brønsted base ( $pK_b = 13.8$ ), which can be converted to ammonium cyanate when dissolved in aqueous solution. Ammonium cyanate can be rapidly hydrolyzed to produce ammonia (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>) and carbonate (CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup>). NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> and CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup> undergo double hydrolysis, and CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup>

absorbs more hydrogen ions in water because of the large degree of hydrolysis, making more OH than H in water. NH<sub>4</sub> plays a role in the reaction to regulate the pH. CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup>, OH<sup>-</sup>, and Co<sup>2+</sup> co-precipitate to form the CoCH nanosheets.

$$CO(NH_2)_2 \rightleftharpoons NH_4CNO$$

$$H_2O + NH_4CNO \rightleftharpoons 2NH_4^+ + CO_3^{2-}$$
 (2)

In the second step, through the hydrothermal and annealing reaction at the selected temperature, Co-MoS<sub>2</sub>/CC were obtained using Co elements as the rivet points. The color of the CC turned black.

The microstructure and morphology of the CoCH/CC and Co-MoS<sub>2</sub>/CC samples were revealed by the SEM images (Fig. 2). In Fig. 2a-c, it can be observed that the two-dimensional CoCH nanosheets are homogeneously grown on the CC. As the amount of synthetic CoCH chemicals increases, these nanosheets become compact and the corresponding thickness gradually increases (Fig. S1†). The large surface area of the CoCH nanosheets provides abundant rivet sites for MoS<sub>2</sub> nucleation. After the second hydrothermal process, these MoS<sub>2</sub> nanosheets are arranged vertically and form a 3D structure (Fig. 2d-f). An Ar annealing treatment is subsequently conducted to improve the crystallinity of the material. The Co-MoS<sub>2</sub>-4/CC sample displays a 3DSC electrode architecture, thereby maximally exposing the edge sites and making the binding of the substrates and catalytic materials more intimate and stable (Fig. 2e). In contrast, pure MoS<sub>2</sub> synthesized without CoCH only forms flat nanosheets on the CC, exposing relatively few active edges (Fig. S2†). In Fig. 2d, MoS2 nanosheets are observed to be agglomerated, which may be because a small amount of the CoCH nanosheet structure is not enough to support a large amount of MoS2. In Fig. 2f, many stacking structures are unable to clearly distinguish the independent CC shape due to the increase in CoCH, which leads to the connection of more MoS<sub>2</sub> nanosheets, causing the nanosheets to grow too tightly. In addition, the EDX elemental mapping images show the homogeneous distribution of Co, S,

and Mo elements (Fig. 2g), which can indicate that the Co element is uniformly dispersed in MoS2.

TEM measurement is carried out to further inquire into the microstructure of Co-MoS<sub>2</sub>-4/CC. As observed in Fig. 3a, the nanosheet morphology of the material is further revealed. The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image shown in Fig. 3b shows that the visible lattice fringes with an interplanar spacing of 0.63 nm agrees closely with the d-spacing of the (002) planes of MoS<sub>2</sub>.<sup>38</sup> The well-defined diffraction rings of the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) can correspond to the spacing of the (110), (100), and (103) planes of MoS<sub>2</sub> (inset in Fig. 3b).<sup>39</sup> The crystalline structure of the as-prepared Co-MoS2-4/CC samples was determined by XRD, as shown in Fig. 3c. It is easy to identify several characteristic diffraction peaks located at 14.0°, 33.5°, 39.5°, and 59.1°, which correspond to the (002), (101), (103), and (110) planes of hexagonal MoS<sub>2</sub> (PDF# no. 75-1539).<sup>38</sup> This result is in agreement with the HRTEM images. Compared with pure MoS<sub>2</sub>, the XRD peaks of Co-MoS<sub>2</sub> do not change significantly. However, with the increase in the annealing temperature, the crystallinity of the materials gradually increased, and a clear diffraction peak of cobalt sulfide appeared in the MoS<sub>2</sub> phase, inferring that Co elements may exist in the form of Co-S bonds in Co-MoS2-4/ CC (Fig. S4†). In Fig. 3d, the Raman peaks appearing at 383 and 407 cm<sup>-1</sup> correspond to the  $E_{2g}^1$  (in-plane) and  $A_{1g}$  (outof-plane) vibrational modes of MoS<sub>2</sub>, respectively.<sup>8,26,40</sup> This indicates that the introduction of Co elements has no effect on the phase structure of MoS<sub>2</sub>.<sup>7</sup>

XPS was conducted to determine the chemical valence composition of the Co-MoS<sub>2</sub>-4/CC catalyst. Based on high-resolution XPS analysis, the presence of Mo, S, and Co elements can be easily identified (Fig. 4a), which are identical to the above EDX result. The spectrum of Mo 3d of the Co-MoS<sub>2</sub>-4/CC catalyst can be assigned to four peaks (Fig. 4b). The peak located at 226.7 eV corresponds to S 2s in MoS<sub>2</sub>. Two significant peaks

at 229.6 and 232.8 eV belong to Mo  $3d_{5/2}$  and Mo  $3d_{3/2}$  components of Mo<sup>4+</sup> in MoS<sub>2</sub>, respectively, consistent with previous reports. 41 Furthermore, the peak at 236.1 eV comes from MoO<sub>3</sub>, which may be due to the slight oxidation of the sample on the surfaces. The S 2p spectrum of Co-MoS<sub>2</sub>-4/CC shown in Fig. 4c displays that the two characteristic peaks at 162.4 and 163.5 eV consist of S 2p<sub>1/2</sub> and S 2p<sub>3/2</sub>, respectively. In Fig. 4d, the Co 2p spectrum could be divided into six peaks at 779.8, 781.3, 786.2, 794.7, 796.2, and 803.2 eV. The peaks located at 779.8 and 794.7 eV are derived from Co3+, and the peaks at 781.3 and 796.2 eV are attributed to Co<sup>2+</sup>, certifying the formation of the Co-S bonds.<sup>23</sup> The S atom connected to the Co atom becomes the most active site for hydrogen binding, which activates the inert base surface of MoS2 to enhance its intrinsic activity.26

The HER performances of the Co-MoS2, CC, CoCH, and MoS<sub>2</sub> catalysts were evaluated by electrochemical testing in 1 M KOH. Fig. 5a presents the LSV curves of these materials. Co-MoS<sub>2</sub>-4/CC only requires an overpotential of 40 mV to supply a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> compared with that of CC (530 mV), CoCH-4/CC (203 mV), MoS<sub>2</sub>/CC (177 mV), Co-MoS<sub>2</sub>-1/CC (62 mV), and Co-MoS<sub>2</sub>-8/CC (53 mV). To demonstrate the superiority of the annealing temperature used in this experiment, electrochemical tests were performed on the materials annealed at different temperatures (Fig. S6†). It is worth noting that annealing at 350 °C can get the best performance of the catalyst. The Tafel slope is used to evaluate the reaction kinetics of the catalysts, and its differences usually show changes in the reaction mechanism. 42 As shown in Fig. 5b, the Tafel slope of the Co-MoS<sub>2</sub>-4/CC electrode is 65.6 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>, which is close to the theoretical value of the Volmer-Heyrovsky reaction pathway (40 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>). The rate determining step is the electrochemical desorption of H<sub>2</sub> molecule. 43 By comparison, for Tafel slopes close to 120 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>, the primary water dissociation step becomes the rate-limiting step. The Tafel slopes of Co-MoS<sub>2</sub>-8/CC, Co-MoS<sub>2</sub>-1/CC, pure MoS<sub>2</sub>/CC,

CoCH-4/CC, and CC increase as 78.8, 93.6, 113.6, 131.0, and 138.5 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>, respectively, demonstrating that the reaction mechanism of Co-MoS2-4/CC is different from that of pure MoS<sub>2</sub>. <sup>19</sup> The transformation of the HER mechanism is because the introduction of Co elements can enhance hydrogen ion adsorption and promote hydrolysis.31 In addition, the HER performance of Co-MoS<sub>2</sub>-4/CC exceeds that of most MoS<sub>2</sub>-based electrocatalysts reported recently (Fig. 5c); thus, it has competitive practical applications. 8,15,20,23,32,33,38,40,43,44

To explore the catalytic mechanisms of these catalysts, the active surface area, intrinsic activity, and conductivity of the catalyst were systematically studied. The  $C_{\rm dl}$ , which is directly related to the ECSA, was derived from the CV curves at different scan rates (Fig. S7 $\dagger$ ). Fig. 5d indicates that the  $C_{\rm dl}$ values are 0.013 F cm<sup>-2</sup> for CoCH-4/CC, 0.11 F cm<sup>-2</sup> for MoS<sub>2</sub>/ CC, 0.52 F cm<sup>-2</sup> for Co-MoS<sub>2</sub>-1/CC, 0.83 F cm<sup>-2</sup> for Co-MoS<sub>2</sub>-4/ CC, and 0.57 F cm<sup>-2</sup> for Co-MoS<sub>2</sub>-8/CC. Compared with pure MoS<sub>2</sub>, Co-MoS<sub>2</sub>-4/CC possesses a larger ECSA. In addition, the intrinsic activity of the catalyst was revealed by the area-normalized LSV curves and turnover frequency (TOF). Among the four electrocatalysts, Co-MoS2-4/CC demonstrates the largest specific current density in the high potential region, as shown in Fig. S8.† The TOF value of Co-MoS<sub>2</sub>-4/CC is 0.32 s<sup>-1</sup>, which is larger than that of  $MoS_2/CC$  (0.03 s<sup>-1</sup>), Co- $MoS_2$ -1/CC (0.15

 $s^{-1}$ ), and Co-MoS<sub>2</sub>-8/CC (0.21  $s^{-1}$ ) at an overpotential of -100 mV (Fig. S9†). It reveals that Co-MoS<sub>2</sub>-4/CC has a higher intrinsic HER activity than MoS2. In addition, an EIS test was further performed to study the conductivity property of the electrocatalysts. The Nyquist plot for determining the charge transfer resistance  $(R_{ct})$  is shown in Fig. 5e, with the equivalent circuit shown in the inset. The Co-MoS<sub>2</sub>-4/CC (0.36  $\Omega$ ) exhibits a smaller  $R_{ct}$  than Co-MoS<sub>2</sub>-1/CC (0.89  $\Omega$ ), Co-MoS<sub>2</sub>-8/CC (0.39  $\Omega$ ), MoS<sub>2</sub>/CC (3.32  $\Omega$ ), and CoCH/CC (3.35  $\Omega$ ), indicating that Co-MoS<sub>2</sub>-4/CC improves the charge-transfer ability at the interface between the electrodes and the electrolytes. This lowering of charge transfer is consistent with the improved HER kinetics. The above measurement results reveal the multiple functions of introducing Co elements in MoS<sub>2</sub>: increasing the catalytic sites, enhancing the intrinsic catalytic performance, and improving the electronic conductivity. Furthermore, the electrochemical stabilities of Co-MoS<sub>2</sub>/CC were measured (Fig. 5f), wherein the LSV curve of the Co-MoS<sub>2</sub>/CC catalysts showed imperceptible change after 2000 cycles. The long-term electrochemical stability test of Co-MoS2/CC was implemented at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> for 24 h in HER condition (inset in Fig. 5f). Remarkably, the overpotential of the Co-MoS2-4/CC catalyst experiences a slight decline, showing excellent electrochemical stability. In Fig. 6, the SEM, XRD, and XPS results of Co-MoS<sub>2</sub>-4/CC after testing were unchanged after HER, indicating that the catalyst has excellent structural and chemical stability.

The active centers of the Co-MoS<sub>2</sub>/CC catalyst are higher than those of MoS<sub>2</sub>/CC. Since Co elements can provide abundant rivet sites for the nucleation of MoS2, this becomes an effective tactic to enhance the number of active edges for the HER catalytic activity. This is similar to the report on MoS<sub>2</sub>/ CoS<sub>2</sub> nanotubes<sup>37</sup> and Co-MoS<sub>2</sub> nanoflowers.<sup>45,46</sup> Therefore, selecting the CoCH nanosheet with a large surface area as a substrate for further growth and dispersion of MoS2 is the basis for establishing the 3D structure and developing abundant active sites. The H atoms tend to bind to the S atoms

close to the Co atoms; thus, the catalytic activity of the S-side in the MoS<sub>2</sub> basal plane is activated.<sup>26</sup> Co and Mo can establish a continuous channel by sharing S atoms to realize charge redistribution, thus increasing the catalytic activity and conductivity of the material to more favorable values. 47,48 Therefore, due to the introduction of Co element, the catalytic activity and conductivity of the catalyst were markedly improved. In addition, pure MoS2 nanosheets have a weaker HER kinetic ability under alkaline conditions. The Co introduced MoS<sub>2</sub> can help optimize the  $\Delta G_{\rm H}$  and promote water separation to improve the catalytic effects of the active sites. 27,32 In addition, traditional powdered electrocatalysts are cast on the current collector using polymer binders, which will cover the active sites, increase the electrical resistance, and inhibit mass transport. However, the self-supported structure enables direct bonding between the catalytic material and the substrate without additional binders, and seamless contact ensures rapid charge transfer. Tight integration can prevent the catalyst from falling off so that the material has excellent stability.35 In this study, the Co-MoS2 catalyst on CC was constructed to form a 3DSC structure, enhancing the kinetics and stability. The rational design and preparation based on MoS<sub>2</sub> meet the overall requirements of self-supported nanostructures, abundant active sites, enhanced catalytic activity, improved conductivity, and excellent stability.36 Therefore, compared with a single-phase, the catalytic performance of the entire system is greatly enhanced. The structural synergy pro-

## Conclusions

**Dalton Transactions** 

In summary, a 3DSC Co-MoS<sub>2</sub>/CC catalyst was designed and synthesized by ingenious nanostructure engineering. Firstly, CoCH nanosheets provide abundant rivet and diffusion sites for MoS<sub>2</sub> nucleation. The rough established structure reduces the adhesion of bubbles and accelerates the movement of electrolytes and bubbles. Secondly, forming the Co-S bonds activates the inert basal planes to improve its catalytic activity and provides a continuous electron transfer path to improve the conductivity of materials. Finally, the unique sheet-crosslinked structure has excellent stability and ensures fast charge transfer by bonding with CC. The significant increase in the active sites and the formation of Co-S bonds lay the foundation for the substantial improvement of the hydrogen evolution performance. It is worth mentioning that 3DSC Co-MoS<sub>2</sub>-4/CC requires only 40 and 119 mV overpotentials at 10 and 100 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, respectively. The catalyst is superior to most of the nonprecious electrocatalysts reported. This work provides a simple integration method and a new strategy for advancing inexpensive and high-performance electrocatalysts.

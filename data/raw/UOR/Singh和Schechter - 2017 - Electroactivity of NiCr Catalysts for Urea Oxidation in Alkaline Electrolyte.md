# Electroactivity of NiCr Catalysts for Urea Oxidation in Alkaline Electrolyte

[Ramesh](http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5718-8938) Kumar Singh and [Alex](http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3464-1936) [Schechter](http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3464-1936)\*[a]

Inexpensive Ni-based catalysts have shown comparable urea oxidation activity to that of precious metals in an alkaline electrolyte. We investigated the urea oxidation on binary NiCr catalysts supported on a carbon matrix in 1m KOH and 0.33m urea. The amount of Cr was optimized in the catalyst layer, and it was found that the catalyst with 40% Cr (Ni60Cr40/C) exhibits the highest urea oxidation activity of 2933 mAmgNi @1 at 0.55 V; with an onset potential of 0.32 V vs. Ag/AgCl. Chro-

noamperometry curves of NiCr catalysts show stability over 2000 s in oxidizing urea. A lower charge-transfer resistance of 3.3 Wcm<sup>2</sup> at 0.40 V was calculated on Ni60Cr40/C compared to that on Ni/C (13 Wcm<sup>2</sup> ). The exceptionally high mass activity of Ni60Cr40/C is attributed to its improved charge-transfer kinetics, enhanced surface coverage of NiII/NiIII redox center, better dispersion of Ni nuclei, and a low-Tafel slope.

## Introduction

Growing demands for energy and global-warming concerns inspire the development of renewable abundant energy sources. Direct urea fuel cells (DUFCs) are regarded as a clean energy conversion device. DUFCs have recently gained significant attention because urea is used as an alternative fuel to hydrogen, which mitigates problems associated with hydrogen production, storage, and transportation.[1–3] However, the power density of DUFCs is lower than that of polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells, owing to the sluggish urea oxidation kinetics at the anode. Urea oxidation on Ni-based catalysts was first reported by G. G. Botte's group in an alkaline solution. [4] They proposed a direct mechanism of urea oxidation on Ni, on which a nickel oxyhydroxide (NiOOH) intermediate initiates urea oxidation in a sequence of electrochemical steps. Density functional theory calculation suggests an indirect path of urea oxidation, in which urea reacts with NiOOH to form its final product in a chemical step.[5] Thereafter, the NiOOH intermediate was probed by in situ surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy[6–8] and in situ X-ray diffraction (XRD).[9] To further improve urea oxidation on Ni catalysts, a variety of binary and ternary Ni-based catalysts, such as Ni–Rh,[10] Ni–Co,[11,12] Ni–Zn–Co,[13] Ni/WC,[14] and Ni/Sn[15] were reported. Most of the catalysts used for urea oxidation were prepared by an electrodeposition method, with which the yield is limited.[4,6,12,16] NiCo2O<sup>4</sup> , [17] Ni1.5Mn1.5O<sup>4</sup> , [18] and LaNiO<sup>3</sup> [19] with improved performance towards urea oxidation prepared by a chemical synthesis method were recently reported. The mechanism on these catalysts is similar to that of Ni.[6,16] Xu et al. critically reviewed various aspects of urea oxidation on a variety of Ni surfaces.[20] Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy investigation of urea oxidation on Ni suggests both a direct and an indirect mechanism path. [21] To date, Ni-based catalysts remain the state of the art for the urea oxidation reaction in alkaline electrolyte.

A NiCr catalyst was recently used in the anode of an alkaline polymer electrolyte fuel cell to improve cell performance.[22] It was suggested that Cr helps modify the electronic structure of the d band by weakening the Ni–O interaction.[22] The NiCr/C catalyst also appears more resistant to inhibition by quaternary ammonium functional group. [23] The enhanced methanol oxidation[24] and hydrogen evolution[23] activities of bimetallic NiCr catalysts in the alkaline medium were reported.

In this article, urea oxidation on NiCr/C catalysts is reported for the first time. Rigorous chemical and electrochemical analyses of the NiCr ratios were performed to identify the most active composition of this catalyst. The highest urea oxidation activity of Ni60Cr40/C catalysts is correlated with the chargetransfer kinetics, particle dispersion, and surface coverage of the NiII/NiIII redox system by using a broad range of analytical methods.

## Results and Discussion

The chemical compositions of the NiCr catalysts were verified by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP–OES) on the acid-dissolved sample and are in good agreement (less than 1%) with the nominal sample composition expected from the reactant ratio (Supporting Information, Table S1).

XRD patterns of NiCr/C powder are shown in Figure 1. For comparison, Ni/C and Cr/C XRD patterns are also included. The peak at 2q=258 is ascribed to the Vulcan XC-72 carbon-support. The peak observed at 33.78 is assigned to Ni(OH)<sup>2</sup> , the

peak at 448 arises from Ni(10 1), which indicates the formation of metallic Ni, and the peak at 60.28 is attributed to the hexagonal structure of Ni.[11] With the incorporation of Cr, the XRD peaks' intensity decreases sharply, and they almost disappear above 40 at.% Cr. Pure Cr depicts almost no crystalline peaks. Moreover, Cr peaks are completely missing from the XRD pat-

tern. It thus appears that Cr increases the amorphization of NiCr particles with no direct evidence of NiCr alloy formation. It is, therefore, concluded that chromium controls the Ni crystallite growth by promoting Ni(OH)<sup>2</sup> formation up to 40 at.% Cr. Above 40 at.% Cr, the Ni(10 1) peak is apparent. The crystallite size estimated from the peak broadening of Ni(10 1) is shown in Table S2. The presence of Ni and Cr was verified from ICP–OES, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) elemental mapping results are given in Figure 2, which presents a typical SEM image of a carbon-supported Ni60Cr<sup>40</sup> catalyst. The morphology of the catalysts is shown in Figure 2(a) and the corresponding energy-dispersive spectroscopic (EDS) analysis of the encircled region in Figure 2(a) is shown in Figure 2(b). A selected-area SEM image is shown in Figure 2(c), and the corresponding elemental-mapping distributions of Cr and Ni are shown in Figure 2(d) and (e), respectively, which could indicate the formation of segregated phases of Ni and Cr. Atomic per-

centages of Ni and Cr obtained from EDS are in good agreement with the ICP–OES results.

Overlaid steady-state cyclic voltammograms (CVs) of NiCr/C catalysts are shown in Figure 3. CVs of Ni/C and Cr/C are included for comparison. The CVs show the typical redox feature of Ni as reported in the literature.[4, 6,16] A featureless voltammogram of Cr/C suggests that it is electrochemically inactive. The anodic peak at &0.38 V is ascribed to the oxidation of NiII(OH)<sup>2</sup> /NiIIIOOH, and the cathodic peak is attributed to the reversible reduction of NiIIIOOH to NiII(OH)<sup>2</sup> . Electrochemical parameters from Figure 3 are given in Table S3. NiCr/C catalysts

show a shift in redox peaks to the negative potentials. This shift is assigned to the lower redox potential of the CrII/CrIII couple than the redox potential of NiII/NiIII, which may shift the overall redox potential of NiCr compared to that of bare Ni. An increase in the anodic peak current is observed with the increase in Cr content up to 40%. Above 40%, the peak current decreases gradually with the further increase in Cr content to 80%. The redox-peak separation potential decreases gradually from 140 to 60 mV with the increase in Cr content from 0 to 80% (Table S3). An observed peak separation of only 60 mV is seen in 80% Cr, which suggests high reversibility of NiII/NiIII redox. This redox-peak separation is close to the theoretical reversible mixed-diffusion controlled process (59 mV for singleelectron transfer).[25] The electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) is calculated from the integration of the charge under the redox peaks using a constant of 514 mC cm @2 for Ni surfaces.[26] A higher ECSA of 285 m<sup>2</sup>gNi @1 is observed in Ni60Cr40/C compared to 123 m <sup>2</sup>gNi @1 of Ni/C, which result supports the better dispersion of smaller Ni nuclei. Thus, the sharp redox features and small peak separation observed on NiCr electrodes point to better charge-transfer kinetics.

The urea oxidation activity of NiCr/C catalysts was measured in 0.33m urea and 1m KOH (Figure 4(a)) and the CVs of Ni/C and Cr/C are included for comparison. In the presence of urea, the anodic current sharply increases in accordance with urea oxidation facilitated by NiIII formation (Figure 3). The oxidation

onset potential exactly overlaps that of Ni in KOH solution, suggesting that the reaction is governed by the NiII/NiIII redox system (Supporting Information, Figure S1). The cathodic peak, assigned to the reduction of NiOOH that was not chemically reduced by urea, serves as an indication that the chemical step (discussed below) is slower than NiOOH formation. At a slow scan rate of 1 mV s@<sup>1</sup> , the cathodic peak current is minute, resulting from the almost complete urea reduction of NiOOH as well as the competitive adsorption of hydroxide and urea to the remaining NiIII sites. However, the cathodic charge on Ni/C (1 mC) is significantly lower in the presence of urea than that in a urea-free solution (5.5 mC) of the same electrode and suggests that most of the generated NiOOH react with urea. As seen from Figure 4(a), Cr/C displays very low currents, which suggests that it is inactive towards urea oxidation. Electrochemical parameters derived from Figure 4(a) are listed in Table S4. With the increase in Cr content, a decrease in onset potential is observed up to 40% Cr, and it increases gradually with the increase in Cr content above 40% (Figure 4(b) and Table S4). A significantly low onset potential of 0.32 V is observed with 40% Cr in NiCr catalysts (Figure 4(b)). This value is among the lowest reported compared with 0.29 V,[18] 0.34 V,[15] and 0.35 V [21] under similar conditions. Figure 4 (c) displays the current densities at selected potentials of 0.40, 0.45, 0.50, and 0.55 V as a function of atomic Cr %, which shows a volcanoshape behavior. A similar trend in current density is seen at all potentials, with the highest current at 0.55 V.

The highest mass activity of 2933 mAmgNi @1 at 0.55 V was calculated for Ni60Cr40/C and is 3.6-fold larger than for Ni (800 mAmgNi @1 ). Ni1.5Mn1.5O<sup>4</sup> was recently reported to exhibit enhanced activity towards urea oxidation,[18] for which the maximum current of 7 mA cm@<sup>2</sup> at 0.50 V is observed compared to 65 mAcm@<sup>2</sup> at 0.50 V in Ni60Cr40/C under identical conditions. A fivefold increase in mass activity was observed with Ni60Cr40/C compared to LaNiO<sup>3</sup> [19] (371 mAmgoxide @1 ) in 0.33m urea and 1m KOH solution.

Tafel slopes of NiCr/C catalysts in the presence of urea are given in Table 1. A Tafel slope of 16 mVdecade@<sup>1</sup> was observed on Ni60Cr40/C, which is lower than that of Ni/C (30 mVdecade@<sup>1</sup> ), suggesting a sharp increase in the current of NiCr catalysts compared to that of Ni. The similar Tafel slope of 28 mVdecade@<sup>1</sup> was reported on Ni film.[16] The addition of Cr thus decreases the Tafel slope by a factor of 2 on Ni60Cr40/C.

CVs of Ni60Cr40/C were recorded at various scan rates with and without urea in 1m KOH electrolyte (Figure 5). In the light of the high activity of the Ni60Cr40/C electrode, it was selected for this analysis. Figure 5(a) shows CVs recorded at various scan rates in 1m KOH solution. Although the NiII/NiIII peak current increases, the anodic and cathodic peak potentials do not change much with the scan rate (u), in line with a redox reversible reaction. A plot of cathodic current density as a function of u shows linear behavior and indicates a surface-confined redox system (inset to Figure 5(a)). This behavior is in line with that reported by Zhang et al., for which the peak current density (I<sup>p</sup> ) proportional to the scan rate below 0.1 V s@<sup>1</sup> is attributed to a surface-confined redox system, and above 0.1 V s@<sup>1</sup> , it becomes proportional to the square root of the scan rate of a dominant diffusion process.[27] The surface coverage of the NiII/NiIII redox system is estimated from Equation (1).[27]

$$I_{p} = n^{2}F^{2}vA\Gamma/(4RT) \tag{1}$$

in which I<sup>p</sup> : peak current, n: number of electrons transferred, F: Faraday constant, u: scan rate, A: geometrical electrode area, G: surface coverage of NiII/NiIII redox system, R: universal gas constant, and T: temperature.

From the slope of the Ipc versus u plot, the surface coverage of the NiII/NiIII redox sites was estimated to be 7.5V 10@<sup>7</sup> mol cm@<sup>2</sup> , which is higher than that for Ni/C (5.0V 10@<sup>7</sup> mol cm@<sup>2</sup> ) and in agreement with the activity and better dispersion of the Ni active sites.

Voltammograms of Ni60Cr40/C as a function of the scan rate in a urea solution are shown in Figure 5(b). An increase in anodic current density is observed with a scan rate at a potential above 0.45 V. With the increase in scan rate from 1 to 10 mVs @1 , the current at 0.55 V changes by 40%, from 62 to 87 mAcm@<sup>2</sup> . The increase in the cathodic peak current with the scan rate is moderate. This is attributed to the sluggish urea oxidation reaction rather than the electrooxidation of Ni(OH)<sup>2</sup> to NiOOH [Eq. (3)].

The fact that the cathodic current is low compared to the Ni redox current is an indication of a slower chemical step [Eq. (3)] than that of NiOOH formation [Eq. (2)].

$$E: \ 6\,Ni(OH)_2(s) + 6\,OH^- \leftrightarrow 6\,NiOOH(s) + 6\,H_2O(I) + 6\,e^- \quad (2)$$

$$\begin{split} C: & CO(NH_2)_2(aq.) + 6\,NiOOH(s) + H_2O(I) \rightarrow \\ & N_2(g) + 6\,Ni(OH)_2(I) + CO_2(g) \end{split} \tag{3} \label{eq:3}$$

in which E: electrochemical step and C: chemical step, as reported in the literature.[6] The oxidation products of urea are N<sup>2</sup> and CO<sup>2</sup> .

A similar increase in cathodic current with scan rate was reported by Boggs et al. in the presence of urea.[4] The fact that the increase in urea oxidation current is not proportional to the scan rate, contrary to the situation in 1m KOH, further supports the claim that the urea oxidation reaction is not purely electrochemical and that it proceeds by an electrochemical– chemical (EC) mechanism. [6] Importantly, no change in the voltammogram was observed above 0.45 V, indicating that no water oxidation takes place.

Chronoamperometric experiments of NiCr catalysts were performed to evaluate the stability of the catalysts for urea oxidation (Figure 6). A stable current persists during a measurement time of 2000 s in oxidizing urea. The higher current observed with Ni60Cr40/C, with respect to other NiCr and Ni electrodes, is in line with the voltammetric results (Figure 4(a)). The noise in the chronoamperometric curves is caused by the formation of N<sup>2</sup> and CO<sup>2</sup> bubbles on the electrode surface with time.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was performed to further probe the urea oxidation reaction on NiCr/C catalysts.

Typical Nyquist plots of NiCr/C catalysts at potentials of 350 and 400 mV are shown in Figures 7(a) and (b), respectively. The charge-transfer resistance (Rct) proportional to the semicircle diameter decreases by one order of magnitude with the in-

crease in potential from 350 to 400 mV. The Rct of NiCr catalysts is given in Table S5. At 350 mV, the charge-transfer resistance of Ni/C is 95 Wcm<sup>2</sup> and decreases sharply to 13 Wcm<sup>2</sup> at 400 mV. The lowest charge-transfer resistance of only 6 and 3.3 Wcm<sup>2</sup> at the potential of 350 and 400 mV, respectively, was calculated on Ni60Cr40/C (Table S5). Thus, the Ni60Cr40/C catalyst exhibits excellent charge-transfer kinetics towards urea oxidation.

A plot of charge-transfer resistance as a function of Cr at.% at potentials of 350 and 400 mV is shown in Figure 8. The enlarged region of the plot is shown in the inset to reflect differences in charge-transfer resistance. The choice of these potentials reflects the sharpest change in charge-transfer resistance, above these potentials the differences among the catalyst resistance are minute. At 350 mV, the resistance decreased drastically from 95 to 12 Wcm<sup>2</sup> with an increase in Cr content from 0 to 10%, in which the lowest resistance of 6 Wcm<sup>2</sup> was observed with 40% Cr. Above 40% Cr, an increase in chargetransfer resistance was observed at both potentials. At 400 mV, the resistance does not change sharply with Cr content, and the lowest resistance of 3.3 Wcm<sup>2</sup> was observed at 40% Cr. The charge-transfer corresponds to the current recorded in the

voltammetric results (Figure 4(a)). The metallic chromium itself has a high charge-transfer resistance of 7890 Wcm<sup>2</sup> at 400 mV, which means that it is inactive in urea oxidation. Ni(OH)<sup>2</sup> / NiOOH is thus the active part in Ni:Cr. We, therefore, believe that the mechanism of urea oxidation with NiCr/C catalysts is similar to that reported by Botte's group, in that NiOOH mediates the preferential oxidation of urea to its products.[5,6,16] In addition, the adsorption of urea on the Ni surface is facilitated through the urea carbon center as based on the theoretical calculation by Daramola et al.[5] As reported by Lu et al., the modification of Cr oxide on the Ni(111) surface decreases the density of state of the d-band by the weakening of the Ni@O bond, which gives convincing evidence for the tuning of the electronic property of Ni.[22] We believe that the electronic effect of Cr on Ni surfaces is seen from the volcano shape of the current density plot (Figure 4(c)).

## Conclusions

Various compositions of NiCr/C were synthesized by direct borohydride reduction at room temperature. The composition of NiCr catalysts was studied, and it was found that 40% Cr, 60% Ni exhibits the highest urea oxidation activity of 2933 mAmgNi @1 at a potential of 0.55 V with an onset potential of 0.32 V vs. Ag/AgCl. This urea oxidation activity value is 3.6 times higher than for Ni/C. However, bare Cr is electrochemically inactive towards urea oxidation. With the increase in Cr content, the amorphous phase of the catalyst was observed from the XRD patterns and the reversibility of NiII/NiIII redox increases. Cr seems to have the dispersion effect to Ni nuclei. The lowest charge-transfer resistance of Ni60Cr40/C reflects improved urea charge-transfer kinetics. The exceptionally high mass activity of Ni60Cr40/C is attributed to the improved charge-transfer kinetics, better dispersion of Ni nuclei, high surface coverage of the NiII/NiIII redox center and low Tafel slope.

## Experimental Section

#### Materials

Chromium (III) chloride hexahydrate (CrCl<sup>3</sup> ·6H2O, 98%), potassium hydroxide (KOH), and sodium borohydride (NaBH<sup>4</sup> , 98%) from Acros Organics; urea (NH2CONH<sup>2</sup> : 99.0–100.5%) from Alfa Aesar; nickel (II) nitrate hexahydrate (Ni(NO<sup>3</sup> )2 ·6H2O: 99.99%) from Strem Chemicals; Nafion (5 wt% solution in aliphatic alcohol) from DuPont; isopropyl alcohol from Frutarom Ltd., Israel, were used as received. High-purity (18.2 MW) de-ionized water (DIW) was used for the syntheses.

#### Synthesis of various compositions of NiCr/C

The experimental conditions for catalyst synthesis are presented in Table S6. In a typical catalyst synthesis, salts of Ni (Ni(NO<sup>3</sup> )2 ·6H2O) and Cr (CrCl<sup>3</sup> ·6H2O) were mixed in the required atomic ratio in an argon-purged solution. The required amount (160 mg) of Vulcan XC-72R carbon was added to maintain a 20 wt% loading of the catalyst on the carbon support, and the solution was stirred for another 1 h. The resultant solution was reduced by drop-wise addition of freshly prepared 4 wt% NaBH<sup>4</sup> while stirring. After reduction, the black solution was centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 10 min to collect the solid product. The black powder was washed 3 times with DIW, re-dispersed in isopropyl alcohol and dried at 708C overnight. Bare Ni/C was synthesized by a similar procedure, without the addition of chromium salt.

#### Electrode fabrication

The glassy carbon disk electrodes were coated by catalyst ink. For the typical preparation of catalyst ink: catalyst (25 mg), isopropyl alcohol (2 mL), water (1 mL), and Nafion (100 mL) were sonicated for 30 min to form a homogeneous suspension of the catalysts ink. Then, a 6 mL volume of the catalyst suspension was drop-cast on the glassy carbon disk electrode to maintain a metal loading of &50 mg cm@<sup>2</sup> .

## Instrumentation

The metal loading and atomic composition of NiCr/C samples were verified by a Varian 710-ES ICP-OES. The NiCr samples were further analyzed by XRD using the Rigaku SmartLab X-ray diffractometer employing Bragg–Brentano optics (BB/PSA). The X-ray generator was operated at 40 kV and 30 mA with Cu<sup>K</sup><sup>a</sup> radiation (l=1.54 a). SEM measurements were performed on an ESEM Quanta FEG 250 system. The images were collected by using secondary electron imaging and backscattered electron detectors equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscope from AMETEK, FEI Quanta 200/400. Electrochemical studies were performed in three-electrode configurations, with a Biologic potentiostat (VSP, Biologic Science Instruments). The catalyzed glassy carbon disk electrode served as a working electrode (from Pine Instruments), Ag/AgCl as a reference electrode (Metrohm), and Pt wire as a counter electrode. The area of the glassy carbon disk electrode was 0.196 cm<sup>2</sup> . Electrochemical impedance spectroscopic measurements were performed by using an AC amplitude of 10 mV in the frequency range of 10 kHz to 50 mHz. Impedance patterns were fitted by the complex non-linear least square fit using ZsimpWin software from Biologic.

Terephthalic acid is conventionally synthesized through the AMOCO process under harsh conditions, making milder electrosynthesis routes desirable. Electrooxidation of p-xylene has been demonstrated but the degree of oxidation is limited, resulting in low terephthalic acid yields. Here, we demonstrate a process with two electrochemical steps enabling the complete oxidation of p-xylene into terephthalic acid. The first electrochemical step achieves C-H activation of p-xylene using electrochemically generated bromine as a mediator, while the second electrochemical step does alcohol oxidation of 1,4-benzenedimethanol into terephthalate on NiOOH. The divided cell in the first step simultaneously generates acid and base that are utilized subsequently, negating the need of external acid and base addition and thus offering a cost competitive synthesis route. The competing bromide oxidation in the second step is suppressed by using constant voltage electrolysis at 0.50 V, where an optimal yield of terephthalic acid of 81% is achieved.

Terephthalic acid (TPA) is of great significance in the polymer industry as a fundamental building block for polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic, which has widespread applications in packaging and textiles. The major industrial synthesis route for TPA is the Amoco process (Scheme 1a), which is the oxidation of p-xylene (PXY) catalyzed by a Co/Mn/Br catalyst in acetic acid solvent.<sup>2-6</sup> The high conversion (>98%) and yield (about 95%) makes the Amoco process widely adopted.<sup>4,5</sup> Nevertheless, the process is typically operated at 175 to 225 °C and under 1.5 to 3.0 MPa of oxygen.<sup>5</sup> These rigorous conditions arise from the difficulty of C-H activation of the intermediate p-toluic acid due to the electronwithdrawing nature of the carboxylic group. 4 Economically, the high temperature and pressure coupled with the corrosive properties of acetic acid solvent and bromide necessitates the use of corrosionresistant but costly materials like titanium.<sup>5</sup> Further considerations, such as solvent loss through burning, flammable organic-oxygen mixtures and the generation of toxic methyl bromide motivate the search for safer synthesis routes.<sup>4</sup>

Many alternative reaction media have been explored to overcome these limitations. Supercritical  $CO_2$ , supercritical water solvents to reduce the flammability hazard. Various catalysts, including both heterogeneous ( $CeO_2$ , AuPd/C, AuPd/MIL-101 and homogeneous catalysts (N-hydroxyphthalimide (NHPl) and Guanidine have been developed to transition to milder conditions, often at the expense of reduced yields. Moreover, the high cost of ionic liquids and noble metal containing catalysts, coupled with the poor stability of organic mediators limits their feasibility.

In contrast to thermochemical approaches, electrochemical synthesis employs electrical potential as the driving force for reactions, eliminating the need for high temperature and pressure and limiting the corrosive nature of reagents and solvents. <sup>21–24</sup> Mild conditions coupled with the decreasing cost of renewable electricity sources make the electrification and decarbonization of chemical processes promising, <sup>25,26</sup> with industrially mature syntheses such as chloralkali process already the incumbent technology. <sup>27</sup> This success has motivated large research expenditures into lab scale organic electrosynthesis pathways in recent years, <sup>28–32</sup> with PXY electrooxidation a focus of many studies (Scheme 1b). <sup>33–38</sup> Loyson et al.

performed electrooxidation of PXY in methanol solvent to produce ether and acetal products. That are also et al. performed the electrooxidation of PXY with Co and Cu catalysts in methanol to make a series of methoxylation products. Balaganesh, et al. employed nitrate as a mediator to convert PXY into p-tolualdehyde in an emulsion electrolysis system. Thasan et al. achieved methyl group bromination or chlorination of PXY in a biphasic undivided cell. Among those studies of PXY electrooxidation, the typical products are ethers, alcohols, aldehydes, or halides, with one notable case of carboxylic acid formation by Lv et al. using MoO<sub>2</sub>/MoP/Nickle foam anode and achieving 77% Faradaic efficiency (FE) toward terephthalic acid in 1 M KOH electrolyte. A significant drawback to this approach is that terephthalic acid is present in the form of terephthalate anion in alkaline, requiring expensive isolation by reacting with acid.

Considering the challenges in direct electrooxidation of PXY to TPA, an approach with two electrochemical steps is considered here: (1) Oxidation of PXY to an intermediate with both methyl groups functionalized; (2) Oxidation of the difunctionalized intermediate to TPA (Scheme 2a). Functionalization of both methyl groups at the beginning is important as further oxidation occurs preferentially on the functionalized methyl group rather than the unfuctionalized one due to the relative difficulty of C-H activation, <sup>39</sup> resulting in oxidation resistant p-toluic acid as the final product.<sup>5</sup> Functionalization of both methyl groups has been reported by Thasan et al. using bromination in a biphasic undivided cell.<sup>36</sup> Despite the limited FE, the 1,4-bis (bromomethyl)benzene is produced as the major product.<sup>36</sup> This compound is readily hydrolyzed in alkaline solution, yielding 1,4-benezenedimethanol.<sup>40</sup> Furthermore, this compound has further been oxidized with MOOH type electrodes (M = Ni) as reported in the literature. 41–44 The resulting product is actually terephthalate (TPA<sup>2</sup>-) necessitating addition of stoichiometric quantities of acid to obtain terephthalic acid (TPA). The current market price of 1 kmol PXY is \$90 and 1 kmol TPA is \$171, for a \$81 profit, though the consumption of 2 kmol NaOH and 1 kmol H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, \$66 and \$15 respectively, undermines the economic viability. 45 Therefore, performing the electrolysis in a basic electrolyte leads to the additional cost of acid and base that are added externally and continuously. The problem could be solved by either using an acidic electrolyte or producing the acid and base inside the process. In this study, we developed a process with two electrochemical steps and one hydrolysis step to achieve the production of TPA without the need of external acid and base.

A divided cell is employed in the first step oxidation, which provides two advantages: (1) Stoichiometric quantities of acid and base are generated in the anode and cathode compartments respectively; (2) FE of bromination is improved since the cation exchange membrane (CEM) blocks bromine crossover, preventing bromine reduction on cathode.<sup>27,46</sup> Sodium bromide solution is introduced into both compartments, and the substrate dissolved in chloroform solvent is introduced to the anode as the organic phase, as shown in Scheme 2b. Chloroform is the lower phase because of its higher density. During electrolysis, the anode is kept above the phase boundary and PXY never directly contact with the anode surface to avoid the possible formation of ring substitution products.<sup>36</sup>

During the first step electrooxidation, the anodic reactions are:

$$4~Br^- \rightarrow 2~Br_2 + 4~e^-;$$
 (Aqueous phase)  $2~Br_2 + H_3C\text{-}Ar\text{-}CH_3 \rightarrow BrH_2C\text{-}Ar\text{-}CH_2Br + 2~H^+ + 2~Br^-;$  (Organic phase)

Here Ar is a benzene ring, and  $H_3C$ -Ar- $CH_3$  is PXY. A series of bromination products were detected are denoted as nBr ( $1 \le n \le 6$ ), with the number representing the number of bromine atoms in the molecule. (Scheme 2c). The 2Br\_geminal has one methyl group substituted by two bromine atoms and one methyl group unsubstituted. Here we use 2Br (Br $H_2C$ -Ar- $CH_2Br$ ) as an example.

The overall anodic reaction is:

$$2 Br^{-} + H_{3}C-Ar-CH_{3} \rightarrow BrH_{2}C-Ar-CH_{2}Br + 2 H^{+} + 4 e^{-};$$

While the cathodic reaction is the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER):

$$4 \text{ H}_2\text{O} + 4 \text{ e}^- \rightarrow 2 \text{ H}_2 + 4 \text{ OH}^-;$$

With initial n moles of PXY, after electrolysis the anolyte is acidic with 2n mol proton and the catholyte is basic with 4n mol of hydroxide. By mixing the product with catholyte, the hydrolysis occurs and consumes 2n mol of hydroxide, generating 1,4-benzene-dimethanol (BDM, HOH<sub>2</sub>C-Ar-CH<sub>2</sub>OH):

$$BrH_2C$$
- $Ar$ - $CH_2Br + 2 OH^- \rightarrow HOH_2C$ - $Ar$ - $CH_2OH + 2 Br^-$ ;

The post-hydrolysis solution then undergoes the second step electrooxidation in an undivided cell, where BDM is oxidized into  $TPA^{2-}$  ( $^{-}OOC$ -Ar- $COO^{-}$ ) on NiOOH anode:

$$\mathrm{HOH_2C\text{-}Ar\text{-}CH_2OH} + 10~\mathrm{OH^-} \rightarrow \mathrm{^-OOC\text{-}Ar\text{-}COO^-} + 8~\mathrm{H_2O} + 8~\mathrm{e^-}$$
:

While on the cathode, HER occurs:

$$8 \text{ H}_2\text{O} + 8 \text{ e}^- \rightarrow 4 \text{ H}_2 + 8 \text{ OH}^-;$$

The generation of OH on cathode ensures the sufficient supply of OH for anodic reaction. The overall reaction of the second step electrooxidation is:

$$HOH_2C$$
-Ar- $CH_2OH + 2 OH^- \rightarrow ^-OOC$ -Ar- $COO^- + 4 H_2$ 

Therefore, after the second step electrooxidation, the remaining 2n mol of hydroxide is consumed. Subsequently, the anolyte from the first step electrooxidation is added into the solution after the second step electrooxidation to protonate the  $TPA^{2-}$ , terephthalic acid (TPA, HOOC-Ar-COOH) will precipitate due to its poor solubility in water:

$$^{-}$$
OOC-Ar-COO $^{-}$  + 2 H $^{+}$   $\rightarrow$  HOOC-Ar-COOH (s)

And the overall reaction of the whole process is:

$$H_3C\text{-Ar-CH}_3+4$$
  $H_2O\to HOOC\text{-Ar-COOH}$  (s)  $+$  6  $H_2$  or PXY  $+$  4  $H_2O\to TPA$   $+$  6  $H_2$ 

The overall reaction equation only consists of PXY reactant, TPA product, water co-feed and H<sub>2</sub> co-product. If carefully operated, pure hydrogen gas could be collected as another product. After isolating the TPA, the liquid phase contains the same molarity of sodium bromide, enabling it to be recycled after the second step electrolysis and reused in the first step. The process is illustrated in Scheme 2d.

In this study, we investigated the PXY electrooxidation using the configuration with two electrochemical steps as discussed earlier,

demonstrating improved Faradaic efficiency using a divided cell in the first step electrooxidation compared with the electrolysis in an undivided cell. The quantities of acid and base in the anolyte and catholyte from the first step electrolysis were determined by titration, proving the separation effectiveness of the cation exchange membrane and its ability to prevent undesirable oxidation of bromide. The nearperfect efficiency of hydrolysis by the base in the catholyte from the first step electrolysis is shown. The NiOOH/Carbon paper (NiOOH/CP) electrode was prepared and used to catalyze the second step alcohol oxidation. In the presence of bromide, the constant potential setup was employed to selectively oxidize alcohol and prevent undesirable oxidation of bromide. Finally, the recyclability of sodium bromide was demonstrated, providing a favorable economic motivation for the demonstrated PXY electrochemical oxidation process.

#### **Experimental**

The first step electrolysis.—An H-cell (10 ml  $\times$  2, AliExpress) was used as the electrolyzer for the first step electrolysis. In the anode compartment, 5 ml 1 M sodium bromide (99%, Fisher Scientific) aqueous solution was prepared as the aqueous phase and 5 ml 0.1 M PXY (99%, Fisher Scientific) in chloroform (99.9%, Fisher Scientific) solution was prepared as the organic phase. In the cathode compartment, 10 ml 1 M sodium bromide (99%, Fisher Scientific) aqueous solution was prepared as electrolyte. A sodium cation exchange membrane was prepared by treating a Nafion N-117 membrane (Fuel Cell Store) with sodium hydroxide following the method described by Cao et al. 48 A 10 cm long platinum wire (0.25 mm diameter 99.9%, Alfa Aesar) was used as the anode, a  $1 \text{ cm} \times 1 \text{ cm} \times 1 \text{ mm}$  platinum foil (Shanghai Yueci Electronic) was used as the cathode to make the surface area of the cathode higher than the anode, and a saturated calomel electrode (Sci Electronic Store) was used as the reference electrode. Electrolysis was controlled through a potentiostat (Princeton Applied Research PAR-1000 and PAR-200 model). A constant current density of 30 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> (calculated using the surface area of the anode) was applied for all experimental runs, and an example of anode potential change during the electrolysis is shown in Fig. S3. The electrolysis was terminated once a predetermined amount of charge had been passed. After the electrolysis, the stirring is continued to allow the complete consumption of Br<sub>2</sub>, which is indicated by the disappearance of the brownish color in both phases.

Hydrolysis of 2Br.—The organic phase in the cathode compartment was transferred into a 50 ml round bottom flask and heated to 70 °C to evaporate all solvent. Incomplete evaporation of solvent may lead to excessive consumption of base due to hydrolysis of chloroform in basic condition. The basic catholyte was then added and the mixture was further heated to 80 °C and a condensation tube with water cooling was installed to the top of the flask to enable the reflux. For 4.5 F mol<sup>-1</sup> products, all solids were dissolved after 6 h, and a clear aqueous solution was obtained. The resulting solution is used for the second step electrolysis. For 8 F mol<sup>-1</sup>, even after 14 h, there were still significant insoluble solids.

Titration of anolyte and catholyte after the first step electrolysis.—The acid and base molarities in the analyte and catholyte respectively after the first step electrolysis were determined by titration. For titration of anolyte, one drop of phenolphthalein solution (0.5 w.t.%, Sigma Aldrich) was added prior to titration. Standard sodium hydroxide solution with known mass fraction was prepared as the titrant. The titrant was added dropwise into the titrate until the titrate solution turned red. The masses of the titrant before and after the titration were recorded to determine the mass of the titrant added. Similarly, for titration of catholyte, one drop of phenolphthalein solution (0.5 w.t.%, Sigma Aldrich) was added prior to titration. Standard sulfuric acid solution with known mass fraction was prepared as the titrant. The titrant was added dropwise into the titrate until the red color of the titrate solution faded. The masses of the titrant before and after the titration were recorded to determine the mass of the titrant added.

The second step electrolysis.—The solution after hydrolysis or a 10 ml standard solution was transferred into a 20 ml glass electrochemical cell with a PTFE cap (BioLogic). The standard solution contains 0.1 M BDM, 0.2 M NaOH, with or without 1 M NaBr. A 1 cm × 1 cm × 1 mm platinum foil (Shanghai Yueci Electronic) was used as the cathode, and a saturated calomel electrode (Sci Electronic Store) was used as the reference electrode. The working electrode (anode) was prepared by electrochemically depositing NiOOH onto a carbon paper (Sigracet 39 AA, 1 cm × 1 cm, fuel cell store). The deposition was achieved through the electrochemical oxidation of Ni (II), using the method developed by Schafer et al. <sup>49</sup> The current density or potential was controlled by the same potentiostat mentioned above. The constant current density electrolysis was terminated once 4 mF charge had been passed. The constant potential electrolysis was terminated once the current density fell below 0.1 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. In the simulating experiments, the post-electrolysis mixture was directly taken for analysis, while in the real second step electrolysis performed using the products from the first step electrolysis, the acidic anolyte of the first step electrolysis was added to convert TPA<sup>2-</sup> into TPA. The resulting suspension was filtered, and the filtration residue was dried and then analyzed. Excess sulfuric acid was added into the filtrate, if no more precipitation and no color change are observed, and the full conversion of TPA<sup>2-</sup> to TPA and insignificant bromide oxidation can be confirmed.

Analysis of electrolysis products.—The first step electrolysis product was analyzed qualitatively by gas chromatography with a mass spectrometry detector (Agilent 5977B GC-MS, HP-5 MS column). For quantitative analysis,  $10~\mu l$  organic phase was taken and diluted in 1 ml acetonitrile (99.9%, Fisher Scientific) for analysis by a gas chromatography with a flame ionization detector (Agilent 7890 GC-FID, HP-5 column). 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene (99.9%, Fisher Scientific) was used as the internal standard and pre-added to the organic phase. The response factors of 1 Br and 2 Br were determined through calibration using the standard material purchased from Fisher Scientific. The response factors of other species were estimated using the effective carbon number described by Scanlon et al.  $^{50}$  The example GC-MS chromatograms are shown in

Fig. S1. The hydrolysis products as well as the second step electrolysis products were analyzed by quantitative proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H qNMR) using an AV III 400 MHz NMR spectrometer. For water soluble products, deuterium oxide (D<sub>2</sub>O, 99.9% D, Sigma Aldrich) was used as the solvent and sodium acetate (99.9%, Fisher Scientific) was used as the internal standard; for water insoluble products, specifically TPA, deuterated dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO-d<sub>6</sub>, 99.9% D, Sigma Aldrich) was used as the solvent and 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane (99.5%, Sigma Aldrich) was used as the internal standard. The quantification results were presented using selectivities, FEs, or yields (specifically for TPA), they are defined as:

$$Selectivity = \frac{Moles\ of\ product\ produced}{Moles\ of\ PXY\ consumed}$$

$$FE = \frac{n \times F \times Moles \ of \ product \ produced}{Q}$$

$$Yield of TPA = \frac{Moles of TPA or TPA^{2-} produced}{Initial Moles of PXY or BDM}$$

Where Q is the amount of charge passed, n is the moles of electrons per mole of product, F is Faraday constant, 96485 C mol<sup>-1</sup>.

Recyclability test.—After the second electrolysis, the filtrate from the suspension after adding anolyte was washed by chloroform twice to remove residue organics and then boiled to remove residue hydrogen bromide. The resulting solution was diluted with water to achieve a volume of 15 ml, which was ready to reuse in the first step electrolysis. The process was repeated twice and the yields of TPA were compared with those obtained using fresh sodium bromide. After the second recycling, the final filtrate was analyzed to determine the bromide quantity. 20 ml 1 M silver nitrate (99%, Fisher Scientific) was added to the filtrate, creating a yellow suspension, which was filtered and the filtration residue, silver bromide, was dried and weighed.

Full consumption of bromine was achieved after the brownish color of both phases completely faded. Constant current density of 30 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> were used in all experimental runs. Aqueous phase in anode compartment: 5 ml 1 M NaBr, organic phase in anode compartment: 5 ml 0.1 M PXY in chloroform, cathode compartment: 10 ml 1 M NaBr. Triplicates were performed for all divided cell experiments and error bars represent the standard errors.

#### **Results and Discussion**

The first step electrolysis—bromination of PXY.—In the biphasic electrolytic system with NaBr in aqueous phase and PXY in organic (chloroform) phase in an undivided cell. The cyclic voltammetry of this system showed distinct features of bromine evolution and bromine reduction (Fig. S2). In this undivided cell, we observed an over 70% carbon balance throughout the 10 F mol-1 electrolysis process (Fig. 1a), but the total FE (or electron balance) remained below 40% (Fig. 1b), which agrees with the literature observation. After 10 F mol<sup>-1</sup>, the organic phase remained brown, indicating incomplete consumption of bromine. After stirring the mixture for 18 h, the brown color faded, and a higher degree of bromination was achieved. The nonideal FE in such an undivided cell can be attributed to the cathodic reduction of bromine. A significant fraction of bromine generated on the anode diffused to and underwent reduction on cathode rather than entering the organic phase to react with PXY.

In order to suppress the bromine reduction, a divided cell configuration was employed. Due to imperfect FE, 4.5 F mol<sup>-1</sup> rather than  $4\,\mathrm{F}\,\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$ , which is the theoretical amount of charge needed for converting PXY to 2Br, is used as the condition for 2Br production. After 4.5 F mol<sup>-1</sup> and full consumption of residue bromine, 100% conversion of PXY was achieved. The selectivity of 2Br and 3Br were 64% and 17% respectively. The FEs of 2Br and 3Br were 57% and 23% respectively. Less than 5% FEs were attributed to 1Br and 2Br\_geminal, suggesting that most of the PXY had undergone activation on both methyl groups (Fig. 1c). The carbon gap could be attributed to the formation of a series of minor products, including ring bromination products and dimerization or oligomerization products of PXY. The formation of ring bromination products is disfavored relative to methyl bromination products, which agrees with the literature.<sup>51</sup> If the electrolysis was terminated at 8 F mol<sup>-1</sup>, which is the theoretical amount of charge needed for 4Br formation, the carbon balance and electron balance became worse (Fig. 1d), indicating more undesired side reactions. The selectivities toward 3Br and 4Br were 39% and 38% respectively, while their FEs were 29% and 38%. Interestingly, extending the electrolysis duration further did not lead to a higher degree of bromination. No 5Br and 6Br could be detected even after 15 F mol<sup>-1</sup> (Fig. S4) electrolysis, where significant gaps in carbon and electron balances were observed. Therefore, to optimally achieve activation on both methyl groups, while maintaining decent carbon and electron balances, a charge passage of 4.5 F mol<sup>-1</sup> was chosen as the termination point for the first step electrolysis.

Hydrolysis of bromination products.—The hydrolysis of products from the first step electrolysis was performed by mixing the organics with the alkaline catholyte. Chloroform must be removed through evaporation to prevent the hydrolysis of chloroform. Loss of chloroform undermines the economic benefit, therefore, recycling the chloroform through condensation is necessary to reduce the cost. Hydrolysis rate at room temperature was slow, leading to negligible conversion of organic bromides. However, heating to 80 °C significantly accelerated the hydrolysis. For 4.5 F mol<sup>-1</sup> products, full conversion of organic bromides was achieved after 6 h (Fig. 2a). The hydrolysis products 1,4-benzenedimethanol (BDM) and 4-formylbenzyl alcohol (FBA) showed a similar distribution as that of the corresponding organic bromides (2Br, 3Br) (Figs. 1c, 2a), indicating a near-perfect hydrolysis. The resulting solution was clear and colorless, with no insoluble solid suspended. However, the hydrolysis of 8 F mol<sup>-1</sup> products was challenging. While FBA was detected with minor loss compared to 3Br quantity in 8F molpost-electrolysis mixture, there was no terephthalaldehyde, the theoretical hydrolysis product of 4Br, detected. After 14 h reaction, significant amounts of insoluble solid particles were still present. The poor efficiency of hydrolysis of 8 F mol<sup>-1</sup> products is explained by the low solubility of terephthalaldehyde,<sup>52</sup> which covers the surface of 4Br particles and inhibits further reactions. More rigorous

conditions or different solvents are possible solutions for this, though further  $8\,\mathrm{F\,mol}^{-1}$  investigations are beyond the scope of this study, given the desirable methyl group activation at  $4.5\,\mathrm{F\,mol}^{-1}$ . The post-hydrolysis mixture of  $4.5\,\mathrm{F\,mol}^{-1}$  products was transferred into the second electrolyzer for the second step electrolysis.

Titration of anolyte and catholyte after the first step electrolysis.—Aside from improved FE, the divided cell also produces acid (HBr) and base (NaOH) in anolyte and catholyte respectively. Assuming 0.5 mmol PXY (5 ml, 0.1 M) in the organic phase, and passing 4.5 F mol<sup>-1</sup> of charge during the first electrolysis, there should be 1.125 mmol HBr in anolyte and 2.250 mmol NaOH in catholyte. Acid-base titration was performed to determine the real quantity of acid in anolyte and base in catholyte (Table I).

The measured acid concentration in analyte was 1.184 ± 0.004 mmol, which is 5.2% higher than the theoretical quantity. This could be attributed to the concurrent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on the anode, which generates 1 proton for every 1 electron, while bromination generates 1 proton for every 2 electrons. Given a fixed amount of charge, the process involving bromination and OER is expected to generate more protons than only bromination. Another possible effect is the reaction between Br<sub>2</sub> and water, which generates HBr and hypobromous acid (HOBr), followed by the decomposition of HOBr into HBr and O2, generating 1 proton for every 1 electron. The base molarity in catholyte was measured to be  $2.121 \pm 0.010$  mmol, 5.7% lower than the theoretical quantity. This discrepancy is attributed to proton crossover through CEM. Considering the amount of base needed for hydrolysis is 0.951 mmol (calculated using the data in Fig. 1c, 1.170 mmol of base will enter the second step electrolysis together with 0.430 mmol aromatics (calculated using the data in Fig. 2a), making the base quantity sufficient to complete the second step electrolysis.

Electrooxidation of BDM on NiOOH/CP.—Given the literature on alcohol electrooxidation over MOOH (M = Ni, Co, Fe, Cu) we deposited NiOOH onto carbon paper taking advantage of both the intrinsically more active catalyst, as well as to improve the surface area over traditional planar electrodes. Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) images before and after deposition (Figs. 3a, 3b) coupled with Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) mapping of Ni (Fig. 3c) confirm successful deposition. The SEM image after electrolysis (Fig. 3d) still showed the presence of NiOOH on the CP substrate. The BDM oxidation performance of NiOOH/CP electrodes was evaluated with 0.1 M BDM standard solution at a constant current density at 5 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> (calculated based on the geometric surface area, which is 2 cm<sup>2</sup>). Clean CP (no deposition) demonstrated poor conversion (28%) of BDM and yield (20%) of TPA<sup>2-</sup>, disintegrating during electrolysis, whereas NiOOH/CP electrodes achieved an 88% conversion of BDM and an 86% yield of TPA<sup>2-</sup> (Fig. 3e, column 1, 2). The 2% carbon gap could be explained by incomplete oxidation, leading to the formation of small quantities of precursors of TPA<sup>2-</sup>. Testing of NiOOH/CP electrode in the presence of 1 M NaBr was performed to assess electrode compatibility and durability.

Electrooxidation of hydrolysis products on NiOOH/CP.—Given its established BDM oxidation effectiveness, NiOOH/CP was incorporated into the cell with the post-hydrolysis mixture containing BDM and FBA (second electrolysis step). Electrolysis was terminated after 4 mF of charge was passed, equivalent to 8 F mol<sup>-1</sup> assuming 0.5 mmol aromatics. After electrolysis, the anolyte from the first step electrolyzer was added to convert TPA<sup>2-</sup> into TPA (Scheme 2d). After electrolysis at 5 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> the insoluble TPA precipitate was isolated by filtration with an overall TPA yield of only 24% (Fig. 4a, column 1). The filtrate was analyzed, displaying significant amounts of terephthalate. Adding excess sulfuric acid into the filtrate resulted in additional precipitation, and a color change from colorless to yellow, indicating the presence of bromine. Combining the precipitation before and after the addition of excess acid resulted in an overall TPA yield of 58% (Fig. 4a, column 2). Despite this improved TPA yield, the addition of excess acid counters the fundamental goal of not introducing external acid. The yellow color after addition of excess acid is a clear indicator of bromide oxidation, possibly to hypobromite (BrO<sup>-</sup>):

$$Br^- + 2 OH^- \rightarrow BrO^- + H_2O + 2 e^-;$$
  
With excess acid added:

 $BrO^{-} + Br^{-} + 2 H^{+} \rightarrow Br_{2} + H_{2}O;$ 

The generation of Br<sub>2</sub> causes the color change.

The bromide oxidation consumes 1 OH $^-$  per 1 e $^-$ , while BDM oxidation consumes 1.25 OH $^-$  per 1 e $^-$ . Therefore, bromide oxidation may lead to retained OH $^-$ , thereby requiring more acid. Furthermore, the pKa(8.7) of HOBr is much higher than the pKa<sub>1</sub>(3.5) and pKa<sub>2</sub>(4.8) of TPA,  $^{53.54}$  thus, enough acid must be added to first protonate the BrO $^-$  before converting the TPA $^{2-}$  into TPA.

Using  $Na_2SO_4$  as the catholyte in the first step electrolysis can reduce  $Br^-$  concentration in the second step electrolysis as bromide only comes from the hydrolysis process, making the theoretical quantity of bromide 0.951 mmol (calculated using the data in Fig. 1c) rather than 10 mmol. The resulting overall TPA yield of 47% demonstrated improvement without the need for excess acid (Fig. 4a, column 3), though still far from ideal.

The bromide oxidation could also be avoided by controlling anode potential. The standard electrode potential of NiOOH/Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> is 0.490 V v.s. SHE, while the standard electrode potential of BrO<sup>-</sup>/Br<sup>-</sup> is 0.761 V v.s. SHE.<sup>55</sup> The 0.271 V gap provides a range of operating potential where BDM oxidation on NiOOH is feasible, but bromide oxidation is suppressed. The CV (Fig. 4c) shows two oxidation peaks, which could be attributed to Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> oxidation and bromide oxidation. According to the CV, the optimal potential should be higher than but not far from the onset

potential of oxidation.  $0.45~V,\,0.50~V$  and 0.55~V were chosen as the potentials to investigate.

The 0.45 V electrolysis suffered from prolonged low current densities (Fig. 4d, blue trace) below 2 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> and stopped after 2.38 mF of charge due to reaching the cutoff current density of 0.1 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> and achieved only a 50% overall TPA yield (Fig. 4b, column 1). The 0.50 V electrolysis showed constantly higher current density (Fig. 4d, green trace), passing 3.09 mF of charge out of a theoretical maximum of 3.25 mF (calculated using the data in Fig. 2a from the second electrolysis step starting mixture of BDM and FBA), achieving 81% overall yield of TPA. Using 0.55 V constant potential setup further increased the current density (Fig. 4d, purple trace), and 3.18 mF charge was passed. The overall yield of TPA was only slightly lower at 77%, but when excess acid was added into the filtrate, the color changed to yellow, indicating bromide oxidation at 0.55 V. Therefore, 0.50 V was chosen as the potential for the second step electrolysis.

Recyclability test of NaBr.—After filtration to separate insoluble TPA, the filtrate should contain only NaBr. The NMR of filtrate (Fig. S5) confirmed minimal presence of organics. The acidity of filtrate was confirmed by a pH strip test, indicating the presence of residue acid. Before performing the recyclability test, the filtrate was washed with chloroform twice to thoroughly extract and remove the residue organics, then boiled to remove the residue acid. The resulting solution was clear, colorless, and close to neutral. Such solution was diluted to 15 ml, introduced into the divided cell (10 ml into the cathode compartment and 5 ml into the anode compartment) and used in the first step electrolysis. 5 ml freshly prepared 0.1 M PXY solution in chloroform was introduced into the anode compartment.

The whole process was repeated with the same conditions as described earlier, and TPA yield was measured at the end of each cycle. The first and second recycling resulted in a TPA yield of 82% and 80% respectively (Figure 5a), both within the uncertainty range of the 0.50 V constant potential electrolysis result in Fig. 4b, indicating a high degree of reusability of NaBr for at least two more cycles. After the second recycling test (i.e., the third cycle), the resulting filtrate was mixed with 20 ml 1 M AgNO<sub>3</sub> solution to test the remaining bromide quantity. Yellow solids believed to be AgBr were precipitated and isolated by filtration. The AgBr solid was dried and measured to be 13.95 mmol (Figure 5b).

The 7% decrease from the theoretical quantity (15.00 mmol) could be attributed to several factors: (1) Loss due to transfer-of-vial; (2) A slight excess of acid in the anolyte, which causes a loss of HBr during the boiling of filtrate; (3) The presence of bromide oxidation, albeit minor, during the 0.50 V s step electrolysis can cause HOBr formation, which decomposes to Br<sub>2</sub> and evaporates after boiling of filtrate; and (4) Possible reactions between Br<sub>2</sub> and CHCl<sub>3</sub>. The loss due to (2) and (3) could be mitigated by carefully collecting the HBr or Br<sub>2</sub> during the boiling of the filtrate, while the loss due to (4) might be avoided by using more inert solvents like CCl<sub>4</sub>, although

the environmental hazard of CCl<sub>4</sub> would be a concern. <sup>56</sup> Despite some loss of recyclability, the high yield of TPA demonstrated earlier and possible improvements to be made in the future justify the validity of the process.

#### **Conclusions**

In this study, we designed a synthesis route for producing TPA from PXY under much milder conditions than the industrial Amoco process through two electrochemical oxidation steps. In the first step, PXY is oxidized into 2Br using electrochemically generated Br<sub>2</sub> by electrochemical oxidation of NaBr in a divided cell. The divided cell not only prevents undesired bromine reduction on cathode, but also generates base for the hydrolysis and the second step electrolysis, along with the acid needed for converting the TPA<sup>2-</sup> into TPA. 2Br is readily hydrolyzed into BDM, which is further oxidized electrochemically into TPA<sup>2-</sup> on NiOOH/CP anode in the second electrolyzer. TPA<sup>2-</sup> is then converted to TPA by combining with the acid in the anolyte after the first step electrolysis (Scheme 2d). This process not only achieves a good (81%) yield of TPA, but also avoid the cost of external acid and base. The acid and base are generated and consumed within the process, negating the need to purchase and externally introduce the acid and base. The recyclability of NaBr also significantly reduces the need for NaBr, only a minor amount of NaBr is needed to compensate for the gradual loss of bromide.

The current process also provides opportunities for expansion into many similar types of oxidation reactions, including the oxidation of 2,5-dimethylfuran to make 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid or oxidation of toluene to make benzoic acid. The Br<sub>2</sub>/Br- mediated C-H activation in the first step electrolysis could also be realized by Cl<sub>2</sub>/Cl- system, which has lower cost and higher oxidation power, although the Cl<sub>2</sub> might be more difficult to handle. Other electrochemical alcohol oxidation systems, such as using other types of MOOH anode or organic mediators like N-Hydroxyphthalimide or guanidine, are worthwhile to explore. Incorporating thermocatalytic systems within the framework of our described process also holds promise for future research and development.<sup>57</sup> These expansions can broaden the scope of applications and enhance the versatility of the electrochemical synthesis process described in this study.

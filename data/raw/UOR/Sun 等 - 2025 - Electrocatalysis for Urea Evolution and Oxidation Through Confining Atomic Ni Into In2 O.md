**Urea, a highly sought-after fertilizer, is conventionally manufactured through the energy-intensive Haber–Bosch process but is frequently encountered as a pollutant in wastewater. Thus, achieving sustainable urea production under ambient conditions and the potential to recycle urea from wastewater represent significant eco-economic advancements. In this study, a novel Ni-confined In2O3 (Ni-In2O3) electrocatalyst demonstrating outstanding capabilities in both the urea evolution reaction (UER) from nitrate and carbon dioxide and the highly efficient urea oxidation reaction (UOR) for waste urea utilization is introduced. Computational data and in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) analysis demonstrate that the unique Ni-oxygen vacancy (Ni-Vo) local structure effectively modulates the electronic configuration of neighboring In and Ni atoms. This structural refinement results in a significantly reduced energy barrier for the potential-determining steps (PDS) in both UER (\*COOHNH2** → **\*CONH2) and UOR (\*CO(NH2)2** → **\*CONHNH2). Consequently, the optimized catalysts achieve a urea evolution faradic efficiency of 19.6%, accompanied by remarkable UOR performance, attaining a 100 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> anodic current density at a potential of 1.35 V. This work not only offers a sustainable route to urea production but also highlights the potential for efficient urea oxidation, contributing to a greener and more economically viable future for the nitrogen cycle.**

# **1. Introduction**

Urea, CO(NH2)2, is known as the most widely used fertilizer worldwide. Currently, extreme conditions (150–200 °C, 150– 250 bar) are required to realize the commercial manufacture of urea by coupling ammonia (NH3) with carbon dioxide (CO2).[\[1\]](#page-10-0) Meanwhile, the industrial synthesis of NH3 still relies on the Haber-Bosch process, which calls for intensive energy input. Annually, 2% of the world's energy is consumed to fabricate NH3, leaving heavy carbon footprints.[\[2\]](#page-10-0) Thus, realizing ambient conditions NH3 synthesis, and even further C─N coupling to manufacture urea is of great significance to a sustainable ecoeconomy. In this regard, electrocatalytic nitrate (NO3 <sup>−</sup>) reduction has been explored as a highly desirable approach to realize mild NH3 generation.[\[3\]](#page-10-0) Since NO3 <sup>−</sup> possesses a much lower dissociation energy (204 kJ mol<sup>−</sup>1) than that of the dinitrogen molecule (941 kJ mol<sup>−</sup>1),[\[4\]](#page-10-0) it may be considered as a more practicable raw material for NH3 synthesis. This technology also provides a sustainable way to denitrify the NO3 <sup>−</sup> contained wastewater, which causes

severe eutrophication. Enlightened by this point, there is great promise in integrating the electroreduction of NO3 <sup>−</sup> into the urea synthesis processes.[\[5\]](#page-10-0) However, since the urea evolution reaction (UER) demands the simultaneous reduction of both NO3 − and CO2 before the effective C─N coupling reaction, this leads inevitably to drastic side reactions and by-products, such as H2, NO2 <sup>−</sup>, and CO, etc.[\[6\]](#page-10-0) Recent research has shown that defectengineered indium-based catalysts hold the potential to enhance surface C-N coupling by modulating intermediate adsorption.[\[7\]](#page-10-0) However, significant challenges persist, primarily related to the implantation of effective reaction active sites to facilitate efficient C─N coupling and suppress by-product formation.

Given the high demand for urea in agriculture, substantial amounts of urea-containing wastewater are annually released, exacerbated by growing human populations generating urineladen wastewater.[\[8\]](#page-10-0) This triggers severe urea-induced eutrophication, alongside potential health risks from elevated urea concentrations in water. As the average molar concentration of urea in human urine is about 0.33 m,[\[9\]](#page-10-0) while wastewater concentrations surpass these levels,[\[10\]](#page-10-0) developing effective urea removal

methods is imperative. Up to now, various strategies, such as hydrolysis, enzymatic decomposition, biological degradation, oxidation, adsorption, and catalytic decomposition, have been explored for urea removal.[\[10\]](#page-10-0) Current challenges in urea synthesis and oxidation include the high energy requirements of traditional synthesis methods, environmental concerns related to nitrous oxide emissions,[\[11\]](#page-10-0) the need for more efficient and eco-friendly catalysts, and the efficient treatment of urea in wastewater. Addressing these challenges involves developing innovative production techniques such as electrochemical processes, advancing green catalysis, integrating urea synthesis with CO2 capture, and employing advanced oxidation processes for wastewater treatment. These strategies aim to enhance sustainability, reduce environmental impact, and improve the efficiency of urea-related processes. Electrocatalytic urea oxidation is gaining traction due to its ability to address the drawbacks in other methods, offering efficiency and avoiding secondary eutrophication by producing N2 and CO2 as oxidation products.[\[10\]](#page-10-0) Nonetheless, urea oxidation reactions (UOR) typically face substantial overpotentials due to complex multi-electron transfer processes. This sluggish reaction kinetics emphasizes the need for high-performance UOR catalysts.

Therefore, an intriguing avenue involves integrating efficient urea synthesis and oxidation into a single electrolyzer to create a closed nitrogen cycle and provide chemical feedstocks simultaneously (**Figure 1**). Designing bifunctional catalysts capable of both UER and UOR becomes pivotal. Various catalysts, including noble metal (Pt, Ir, Ru) and non-noble metal catalysts, have been explored to address sluggish urea oxidation kinetics.[\[12\]](#page-10-0) Among non-noble metals, Nickel (Ni)-based catalysts have shown efficacy for UOR, with the active NiOOH phase facilitating oxidation due to its unique oxophilic termination.[\[13\]](#page-10-0) Doping with transition metals holds greater research value and practical significance due to their affordability, abundant availability, and competitive catalytic activity. From a UER standpoint, Ni species are also promising for promoting nitrate protonation.[\[14\]](#page-10-0) Apparently, it remains a great challenge to combine surface vacancy/defect engineering with rationally planted active Ni species to synergistically promote both UER and UOR at the same time while encapsulating the nitrogen cycle.

In this study, we present a novel bifunctional catalyst composed of Ni-confined In2O3 nanosheets (Ni-In2O3), which effectively enables the direct UER from CO2 and nitrate, alongside high-performance UOR. This capability allows for the

integration of urea production and degradation processes within a single system, creating a closed-loop nitrogen cycle. This integration is crucial for the sustainable management of nitrogen resources. Utilizing a combination of computational calculations and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), we elucidate the unique Ni-oxygen vacancy (Ni-VO) structure in Ni-In2O3 with tunable local electronic properties. Our theoretical model highlights the significant role of this unique Ni-VO structure in reducing the energy barriers for the potential-determining steps (PDS) of both UER and UOR. In situ XAS studies further reveal that the synergistic effects stemming from the unique Ni-VO structure greatly facilitate the interaction between the catalyst and key intermediates. Consequently, the optimized catalysts demonstrate a urea yield rate of 668 μg h<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> gcat<sup>−</sup>1, accompanied by a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 19.6%. Additionally, this catalyst exhibits an exceptional UOR anodic current density of 100 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2, achieved at a bias of only 1.35 V versus RHE. The stability and durability of the catalyst under operating conditions further support its practical application. Moreover, by reducing energy consumption, utilizing waste streams, and achieving efficient nitrogen management, this bifunctional catalyst provides a sustainable method to simultaneously produce valuable urea and reduce the load of various pollutants present in wastewater, and its application can bring significant environmental and economic benefits.

## **2. Results and Discussion**

#### **2.1. Catalyst Modelling and DFT Calculations**

To design a bi-functional catalyst, we focus on previous research on the UER and UOR catalysts. Among various UER catalysts, when indium was incorporated, the urea yield was high near the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) potential (Table S1, Supporting Information).[\[1,7,15\]](#page-10-0) Through defect engineering (oxygen vacancy, VO), the energy barrier for the protonation of the CO2NH2 intermediate can be lower which is considered a potential determining step.[\[7\]](#page-10-0) Also, via doping, interface, or adopting two different metals, the researcher can redistribute the electronic structure to boost the UER.[\[7,15\]](#page-10-0) On the other side, Ni-based catalysts are widely used as a UOR catalyst. Like the UER case, surface VO can facilitate the UOR reaction because of the larger active surface area.[\[16\]](#page-10-0) By introducing extrinsic chemical elements as dopants, it is possible to modulate the energy barrier of the intermediates during UOR.[\[16b,17\]](#page-10-0) Considering all these factors, we model the Ni dopants in the bixbyite In2O3 structure which is considered the most well-studied structure for indium oxide. Given that the In atom usually exhibits a 3+ oxidation state, and the Ni atom a 2+ oxidation state, VO is expected to exist to achieve charge neutrality when Ni dopants are introduced in In2O3.

To investigate the Ni-doped In2O3 catalyst surface, we performed density-functional theory (DFT) periodic slab calculations. We chose the In2O3(111) surface because it has the lowest surface energy.[\[18\]](#page-10-0) In order to explore the effect of doping density, we generated 3 different surface slabs, namely In2O3(111), Ni-In2O3-1(111), and Ni-In2O3-2(111) (**Figure 2**[a–c\)](#page-3-0). Especially for Ni-doped In2O3 surfaces, the presence of VO is also considered, and we found that the VO formation near the Ni atom is thermodynamically most favorable (Figure S3, Supporting Information).

We have also calculated the projected crystal orbital Hamilton population (pCOHP) and analyzed the chemical bond strength between specific metal and oxygen atoms (Figure [2d\)](#page-3-0). This allows us to address the chemical bond character modification upon Ni substitution and oxygen vacancy creation. From the pCOHP calculations, one can determine the bonding, non-bonding, and anti-bonding state characters of the metal–oxygen bonds via the integration of pCOHP (i.e., the IpCOHP).[\[19\]](#page-10-0) We note that it is customary to report the negative of these values and the larger the -IpCOHP values, the stronger the chemical bond strength.[\[20\]](#page-10-0) From our slab models, we can find that the Ni─O bonds are weaker than the In─O bonds. This indicates that when the VO is created, Ni─O bonds are deemed most likely to break in preference to In─O bonds to accommodate the VO nearby and this corroborates well with our vacancy formation energy results (Figure S3, Supporting Information). In another word, the VO is more likely to be generated adjacent to the Ni substituent, leading to the formation of a unique Ni─VO structure. We have also inspected other metal–oxygen bonds away from the Ni substituent and found they show very similar -IpCOHP values, and hence having similar bond strength and characteristics regardless of their proximity to either the Ni substituent or VO.

The confinement of Ni atoms within the lattice of In2O3 leads to the formation of adjacent VO, resulting in a unique Ni-VO local structure. To investigate their synergistic effects on both UER and UOR, we performed DFT-based Gibbs free energy calculations. As previously reported, the UER involves several complex steps, including the separate reduction of CO2 and NO3 <sup>−</sup> and the C–N coupling reaction. Lv et al. revealed that within these steps, the potential determining step (PDS) for the overall reaction is the protonation of \*CO2NH2 (\*CO2NH2 → \*COOHNH2), when the catalyst was InOOH.[\[7\]](#page-10-0) In our case, when we use In2O3 as the catalyst, the PDS is determined as the dehydroxylation of \*COOHNH2 (\*COOHNH2 → \*CONH2), as shown in Figures [2e](#page-3-0) and S4 (Supporting Information). Therefore, it is crucial to elucidate the influence of the Ni-VO structure on this key step. In our optimized model (Figure S5, Supporting Information), we observed distinct adsorption tendencies for In2O3 and Ni-In2O3. In the case of In2O3, the oxygen atoms from reaction intermediates directly bond to the In atoms. However, with the introduction of Ni dopants, the oxygen atoms from reaction intermediates flexibly bond with Ni atoms, and not only with the In atoms. This different adsorption mode leads to a noticeable difference in the calculated Gibbs free energy. Comparing the Gibbs free energy calculations for this PDS of UER on In2O3 and Ni-In2O3-1, we find that the Gibbs free energy on In2O3 (1.86 eV) is significantly higher than that on Ni-In2O3-1 (1.67 eV). The favored PDS on Ni-In2O3-1 can thus be attributed to the presence of Ni within the In2O3 lattice. Our -IpCOHP results support this difference, showing that the In─O bond is stronger than the Ni─O bond, requiring more energy (i.e., a higher energy barrier) to break during the dehydroxylation of the O atom. However, it's worth noting that excessive Ni substitution is not always more beneficial. When too many Ni atoms are substituted, the catalyst's surface struggles to stabilize the COOHNH2 molecule, resulting in a weak physical bond between the surface and the molecule. This is evident from the Ni-In2O3-2 surface (i.e., the surface model with a higher Ni dopant concentration), where the \*COOHNH2 molecule exhibits a stretched Ni─O bond length 12% longer than

that in NiO (Figure S6c, Supporting Information). Additionally, charge density difference plots indicate no significant electronic interaction between the Ni and O atoms (Figure S7, Supporting Information), and the calculated adsorption energy of COOHNH $_2$  is +0.44 eV (i.e., endothermic in nature). In conclusion, the Ni-V $_0$  local structure plays a pivotal role in the urea

generation process by significantly promoting the PDS. However, this synergistic enhancement is only achieved when a small amount of Ni atoms is confined within the  $\rm In_2O_3$  lattice. [22]

Turning our attention to the UOR, it may seem analogous to the reverse reaction of UER, but as previously elucidated, the PDS of UOR differs significantly. In the UOR, the critical step

**[www.advancedsciencenews.com](http://www.advancedsciencenews.com) [www.afm-journal.de](http://www.afm-journal.de)**

involves the deprotonation process of \*CO(NH2)2 (\*CO(NH2)2 → \*CONHNH2).[\[23\]](#page-10-0) In the case of In2O3 as the catalyst, the symmetric structure of \*CO(NH2)2 results in strong hydrogen bonding within the amino group, rendering the deprotonation of \*CO(NH2)2 exceedingly challenging.[\[16b\]](#page-10-0) The N─C bond lengths in this scenario are 1.44 and 1.46 Å (Figure S8a, Supporting Information), and the Gibbs energy for this deprotonation step reaches a high value of 0.72 eV. However, when Ni-In2O3-1 catalysts are considered, \*CO(NH2)2 is found to be thermodynamically favoured for adsorption on both Ni and In atoms, yielding a substantially lower Gibbs energy of −0.2 eV. In this configuration, N─C bond lengths measure to be 1.42 Å (adjacent to In) and 1.45 Å (adjacent to Ni) (Figure S8, Supporting Information). The difference charge density plot reveals that N atoms interact strongly with In atoms while interacting weakly with Ni atoms (Figure S10, Supporting Information). Notably, the subsequent \*CONHNH2 intermediates exhibit rather dissimilar N─C bond lengths of 1.51 and 1.29 Å (Figure S9b, Supporting Information). Ni-In2O3-1 appears capable of disrupting the symmetry of structure and electronic structure of UOR intermediates, in contrast to both In2O3 and Ni-In2O3-2 (Figures S9 and S10, Supporting Information). The reason behind Ni's significant facilitation of the UOR process is believed to be attributed to the synergy effect between Ni and VO species. VO formation induces electron delocalization, rendering surrounding metal atoms electron-rich.[\[16a\]](#page-10-0) The enriched electrons can be transferred from the N─Ni bonds to the other bonds during deprotonation. With an increase in Ni concentration, the reaction Gibbs energy rises to 0.2 eV. Under these conditions, N atoms from \*CO(NH2)2 prefer to adsorb simultaneously on two adjacent Ni atoms rather than coupling with one Ni atom and one In atom. In summary, our DFT results demonstrate that due to the synergistic effect of the Ni-VO structure, Ni-In2O3 with optimal concentration could greatly promote the PDS of both UER (\*COOHNH2 → \*CONH2) and UOR (\*CO(NH2)2 → \*CONHNH2).

#### **2.2. Synthesis and Characterization**

Expanding on the aforementioned discoveries, we embarked on the synthesis of three distinct types of nanosheet catalysts: pristine In2O3, Ni-In2O3-a with a lower concentration of confined Ni, and Ni-In2O3-b with a higher concentration of confined Ni, guided by the established theoretical model.

The synthesis process for Ni-confined In2O3 nanosheets (Ni-In2O3) is outlined in **Figure [3](#page-5-0)**a and involves a simple two-step methodology. Initially, Ni-confined In(OH)3 (Ni-In(OH)3) was synthesized through a base-supported hydrothermal procedure. Subsequent exposure to elevated temperatures in an air atmosphere resulted in the formation of Ni-In2O3. Varying the concentration of the Ni precursor allowed for the production of Ni-In2O3 samples with differing Ni ratios.

As evident from the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns displayed in Figure [3b,](#page-5-0) pristine In2O3 exhibits the characteristic cubic bixbyite structure (JCPDS No.06-0416). Following Ni confinement, there are no additional diffraction peaks corresponding to a secondary phase, indicating the successful incorporation of Ni atoms within In2O3 and the prevention of nickel oxide formation. A significant observation emerges when examining the magnified XRD pattern of the (222) peak, where Ni-In2O3-a (with a Ni/In ratio of 8.2%) exhibits a positively shifted trend. This deviation aligns with Bragg's equation, signifying a reduced lattice constant (as shown in Table S2, Supporting Information). This lattice contraction can be attributed to the replacement of In by Ni at lattice points, considering the ionic radii of In3<sup>+</sup> and Ni<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> are 81 and 69 Å,[\[24\]](#page-10-0) respectively. Moving to Ni-In2O3-b with a higher Ni/In ratio, the (222) peak displays a more pronounced positive shift (Figure S11, Supporting Information), signifying a further lattice contraction due to the increased number of Ni atoms incorporated within the In2O3 lattice. Survey X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) curves of In2O3, Ni-In2O3-a, and Ni-In2O3 b are presented in Figure S12 (Supporting Information). Ni 2p peaks are observed in Ni-In2O3-a and Ni-In2O3-b, confirming the presence of confined Ni atoms. Ni-In2O3-b exhibits significantly higher Ni peak intensity due to its elevated Ni concentration. Based on these findings, the Ni/In ratios for Ni-In2O3-a and Ni-In2O3-b are determined to be 8.2% and 27.7%, respectively.

In accordance with insights from the theoretical model, a detailed investigation focusing on Ni-In2O3-a is conducted to gain a comprehensive understanding of its intricate local structure. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images confirm the presence of a uniform nanosheet structure in Ni-In2O3-a (Figure S13, Supporting Information). Notably, Figure [3c](#page-5-0) reveals prominent nanocaves on the nanosheet's surface, resulting from the dehydration process of In(OH)3. These nanocaves are expected to facilitate the adsorption of reactant species. Upon closer examination of the magnified image (Figure [3d\)](#page-5-0), the marked lattice distance aligns well with the (222) facet of In2O3. Elemental mapping images of Ni-In2O3-a, obtained using Energydispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), demonstrate a homogeneous distribution of Ni species across the In2O3 surface (Figure S14, Supporting Information). Further validation is provided by the EDS line scanning image of Ni-In2O3-a (Figure S15, Supporting Information), which confirms the uniform distribution of Ni species within the nanosheet. Employing high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) and annular bright-field (ABF) STEM, we obtain a comprehensive insight into the fine structure of Ni-In2O3 a. In Figure [3e,f,](#page-5-0) the presence of a confined Ni atom within the lattice of In2O3 is discerned, highlighted by the marked orange circle in the HAADF-STEM image. This observation is corroborated by the corresponding intensity profiles, which illustrate the Z-contrast between In and Ni elements. Focusing on the (222) plane, the ABF-STEM image provides further clarity on the local structure of Ni-In2O3-a (Figure [3g\)](#page-5-0). As shown in Figure [3h,](#page-5-0) the magnified image reveals the presence of Vo, indicated by the marked yellow circle. The corresponding intensity profile confirms the substantial reduction in intensity due to the absence of an oxygen atom (Figure [3i\)](#page-5-0).

In the quest to deepen our understanding of the local structure, we delved into the chemical states of Ni-In2O3. To this end, we examined the core-level XPS spectra of In2O3, Ni-In2O3-a, and Ni-In2O3-b. In the case of pristine In2O3, as depicted in Figure S16a (Supporting Information), the O 1s spectrum exhibited distinct signals attributed to the O─In bond, VO, and surfaceadhered oxygen-containing functional groups. In contrast, the Ni-In2O3-a/b samples displayed O─Ni bonds in their O 1s spectra (Figure S16b,c, Supporting Information), signifying the bonding

interaction between the confined Ni atoms and the In2O3 lattice. Notably, we observed that an increased O─Ni bond ratio corresponds to a higher VO concentration. This observation aligns with the DFT predictions that introducing Ni will induce the formation of VO. The rationale behind this trend lies in the strain introduced by a higher Ni concentration (Figure S10, Supporting Information magnified XRD), leading to more pronounced lattice distortion. Consequently, the O─Ni bond is disrupted, ultimately generating VO to alleviate the induced strain. The variation in VO concentration is also evident in electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy (Figure S17, Supporting Information).[\[25\]](#page-10-0) Thus, the complex interplay between O─Ni bonds, oxygen vacancies, and strain-induced effects underscores the intricate nature of the chemical environment in Ni-In2O3. Moreover, examining the core-level Ni 2p spectra of In2O3 (Figure S18, Supporting Information), no Ni species-related signals were detected. However, in the case of Ni-In2O3-a and Ni-In2O3-b samples, distinct Ni─O signals were evident, indicating a Ni oxidation state of 2+ (Figure S18, Supporting Information).[\[26\]](#page-10-0)

To gain a deeper understanding of the synergistic effect of Ni-Vo species on the local chemical environment within In2O3, we conducted a comparative analysis of the core-level Ni 2p and In 3d spectra of Ni-In2O3-a and Ni-In2O3-b, juxtaposed with pristine NiO and In2O3, respectively. In Figure S20a (Supporting Information), a comparison of the Ni 2p spectra of Ni-In2O3-a and Ni-In2O3-b with pristine NiO reveals a distinctive negative shift in the peaks for both catalysts. This shift indicates an increased electron density surrounding the Ni atoms.[[27\]](#page-10-0) This observation is in line with the theoretical model. Similarly, the In 3d spectra of Ni-In2O3-a and Ni-In2O3-b exhibit a negative shifting trend compared to pristine In2O3 (Figure S20b, Supporting Information), pointing to an enhanced electron density surrounding the In atoms. These observed shifts in the Ni 2p and In 3d peaks can be attributed to the influence of VO, which induces the presence of delocalized electrons. These electrons subsequently diffuse to neighboring metal atoms, rendering those atoms electronriching. Furthermore, as the Ni confinement concentration increases, both the Ni 2p and In 3d peaks display further negative shifts. This observation supports the notion that an increasing presence of Ni-VO structure directly contributes to the electronrich nature of the Ni and In atoms, aligning with our theoretical model.

To gain further insights into the local structure of Ni-In2O3, we conducted XAS of the Ni and In K-edges for Ni-In2O3-a/b species and the reference samples. The X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) curves shown in Figure S21 (Supporting Information) reveal a noticeable negative shift in the white line edges of Ni-In2O3-a/b compared to NiO and In2O3. This shift suggests that the incorporation of Ni atoms into In2O3 leads to a significant change of the valence state owing to the lattice rearrangement. Consequently, both In and Ni sites experience a regulation to a higher charge density state, which can be attributed to the electron dislocation induced by VO as suggested by our theoretical model.[\[16a,28\]](#page-10-0) The formation of VO resulting from the incorporation of Ni incorporation is further elucidated in the subsequent section by extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EX-AFS) analysis. Analyzing the wavelet transform (WT) plots of the In K-edge for In2O3 (Figure S22a, Supporting Information), two maxima at approximately (4.0 Å<sup>−</sup>1, 1.6 Å) and (6.5 Å<sup>−</sup>1, 3.4 Å) were assigned to the In-O and In-In scattering paths, respectively. However, in comparison, the second maxima of both Ni-In2O3 a/b shifted to higher k values in the WT plots (Figure S22b,c, Supporting Information). This shift can be attributed to the doping effect of Ni and the overlap of the In-Ni scattering.[\[29\]](#page-10-0) In the case of NiO WT plots (Figure S22d, Supporting Information), two maxima at around (4.5 Å<sup>−</sup>1, 1.5 Å) and (5.6 Å<sup>−</sup>1, 2.5 Å) were assigned to the Ni─O and Ni─Ni scattering paths. In Figure S22e (Supporting Information), strong Ni─O scattering intensity is evident from Ni-In2O3-a, while the Ni─Ni intensity is relatively low, indicating a low concentration of adjacent Ni atoms, consistent with the previous DFT model. In contrast, the second maximum intensity observed in Ni-In2O3-b is notably higher than that in Ni-In2O3-a (refer to Figure S22f, Supporting Information), suggesting a greater concentration of adjacent Ni atoms in Ni-In2O3 b. To further investigate the local atomic structures of the catalysts, Figure S22a (Supporting Information) presents the Fouriertransformed (FT) k2-weighted EXAFS spectra at In K-edge. All the spectral profiles are similar, indicating that doping Ni does not significantly alter the crystal structure of In2O3. However, a slight modification of the local atomic structure can be observed. As depicted in Figure S23a (Supporting Information), the first peak at ≈1.6 Å corresponds to In─O scattering, while the second peak at 3.4 Å can be attributed to In-In scattering. The FT-EXAFS fitting results (Table S5 and Figure S24, Supporting Information) evident that with an increase in Ni concentration from Ni-In2O3-a to Ni-In2O3-b, the In─O distance exhibits a gradual increase. Moreover, as illustrated in Figure S22b (Supporting Information) and its corresponding fitting results in Table S6 and Figure S25 (Supporting Information), a similar trend is observed in the Ni─O bond length. Additionally, the coordination number of the first shell of In-O and Ni─O is reduced with the incorporation of Ni, suggesting the formation of Vo, which is consistent with the analytical findings from above XANES at Ni and In Kedge. Therefore, it can be inferred that when Vo is present, the bond length decreases due to fewer coordinating oxygen atoms around the In or Ni atoms.

However, the Ni─O interaction experiences a more pronounced reduction, which is expected to enhance the formation of VO in the Ni-In2O3 catalyst, in line with our DFT model.[\[29a\]](#page-10-0)

#### **2.3. Electrochemical Performance**

We proceeded with electrochemical measurements of In2O3, Ni-In2O3-a, and Ni-In2O3-b to assess their performance in both UER and UOR, aiming to validate the influence of the unique Ni-Vo local structure of these catalysts on their catalytic performance. For the UER reaction, we utilized a CO2-saturated KNO3 electrolyte. The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves in **Figure [4](#page-7-0)**a reveal that the Ni-In2O3-a sample achieved the highest current density. A comparison with the LSV curve in the presence of 0.1 m NO3 <sup>−</sup> indicates that the reduction current decreases in the absence of NO3 <sup>−</sup> can likely be attributed to the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) (Figure S26, Supporting Information).[\[30\]](#page-10-0) Using 0.5 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> as a benchmark, we calculated the onset potentials for In2O3, Ni-In2O3-a, and Ni-In2O3-b to be −0.29, −0.22, and −0.31 V versus RHE, respectively. Notably, Ni-In2O3-a displayed enhanced current density in the CO2-saturated electrolyte

compared to the Ar-saturated one, indicating improved net current density for UER with the concurrent reduction of CO2 and NO3 <sup>−</sup> compared to sole NO3RR (Figure 4b).[\[15c,31\]](#page-10-0) To assess the catalysts' conductivity, we conducted electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and analyzed the Nyquist plots and equivalent circuit (Figure S27, Supporting Information). Ni-In2O3-a exhibited the smallest charge transfer resistance. However, with a further increase in Ni doping concentration in Ni-In2O3-b, the charge transfer efficiency decreased.[\[32\]](#page-10-0) It may be caused by the excessive defects within Ni-In2O3-b, which would block the electron channel and deactivate the catalyst surface.[\[33\]](#page-10-0) We also examined the electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) of the catalysts, a factor believed to contribute to catalytic activity.[\[7\]](#page-10-0) For this purpose, we measured the double-layer capacitance (*C*dl) of all samples (Figure S28, Supporting Information). Remarkably, the ECSA of the three synthesized catalysts was nearly identical. Consequently, this evidence suggests that the enhanced reaction performance is not attributed to their electrochemical adsorption capability but rather to the intrinsic properties of the catalysts, stemming from the regulation of their local atomic structure.[\[34\]](#page-10-0)

Knowing the catalytic performance is dominated by the local structure of the catalysts, we further examined the UER performance with different biases (Figure 4c). It could be seen that among the tested three samples, Ni-In2O3-a samples obtained the largest urea yield rates, while the yield rate increased the bias increasing. Interestingly, sample In2O3 also obtains a higher urea yield rates compared to Ni-In2O3-b. As a result, the urea yield rates increase with the trend of Ni-In2O3-b *<* In2O3 *<* Ni-In2O3-a, which is well aligned with the DFT calculation results (Figure [2e\)](#page-3-0). Since it is demonstrated that, comparing with In2O3, the introduction of the low amount of Ni atom will obviously promote the PDS (\*COOHNH2 → \*CONH2) due to the unique Ni- VO local structure. However, high Ni doping concentrations led to adjacent Ni─Ni structures will greatly reduce the interaction between the catalyst and the intermediates, which is more like a physical interaction.[\[21\]](#page-10-0) This will consequently diminish the reaction processing. Therefore, from both experiment and theoretical modeling, it could be demonstrated that the unique Ni-VO local structure is of great importance for the urea generation process by facilitating the key reaction step. Moreover, as shown in Figure S29a (─), the higher urea Faradic efficiency is obtained −0.4 V versus RHE of 19.6%, which will decrease with the bias increase.

Shifting our focus to the UOR aspect, all samples were evaluated in an electrolyte containing 1 m KOH and 0.33 m urea, closely resembling a natural urea solution.[\[35\]](#page-11-0) Using Ni-In2O3-a as an example, we observed that Ni-In2O3-a achieved significantly higher UOR current density compared to OER (Figure 4d), indicating that UOR is more favorable than OER under these conditions. The Tafel slopes of Ni-In2O3-a in UOR and OER were calculated to be 15 and 49 mV dec<sup>−</sup>1, respectively, demonstrating that UOR is more kinetically favorable than OER (Figure S30, **[www.advancedsciencenews.com](http://www.advancedsciencenews.com) [www.afm-journal.de](http://www.afm-journal.de)**

Supporting Information). Considering all three samples, Ni-In2O3-a outperformed In2O3 and Ni-In2O3-b (Figure [4e\)](#page-7-0). Specifically, at a benchmark current density of 25 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2, Ni-In2O3 a required a bias of 1.31 V versus RHE, while In2O3 and Ni-In2O3-b demanded biases of 1.7 and 1.32 V versus RHE, respectively, to achieve the same current density. Notably, Ni-In2O3-a achieved a maximum current density of 200 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> with a bias of only 1.42 V versus RHE. The UOR Tafel plots (Figure S31, Supporting Information) also indicated that Ni-In2O3-a exhibited the smallest slope. To the best of our knowledge, this performance is comparable to or even better than some of the most recent reported works (Figure S32, Supporting Information).[\[36\]](#page-11-0) These results highlight the exceptional UOR performance of Ni-In2O3 a and underscore its potential as a promising catalyst for urea electrooxidation.

To determine whether the performance enhancement is influenced by variations in the electrochemical adsorption capability of the catalysts, we re-evaluated the ECSA of all three catalysts under UOR conditions (Figure S33, Supporting Information). The ECSA for all three catalysts remained very similar. This suggests that differences in the electrochemical surface area do not significantly contribute to the enhancement in catalytic performance, and instead, the improved performance is primarily attributed to the optimized local structure of the catalysts.[\[36f,37\]](#page-11-0) We also evaluated the reaction conductivity of the three catalysts through EIS (Figure S34, Supporting Information). The obtained curves were fitted with an equivalent circuit, which comprises resistances for solution resistance (*R*s), catalyst bulk resistance (*R*1), and electrode-electrolyte interfacial migration resistance (*R*2).[\[38\]](#page-11-0) It is evident that the introduction of a small amount of Ni in the Ni-In2O3-a sample led to an increase in both *R*<sup>1</sup> and *R*<sup>2</sup> compared to In2O3. However, with a higher Ni concentration in Ni-In2O3-b, both R1 and R2 increased once again. This indicates that changes in the local structure result in varied charge transfer resistance, which ultimately impacts the catalyst's performance.

To assess the stability of the best catalyst, Ni-In2O3-a, we conducted stability tests for both UER and UOR reactions. As depicted in Figure [4f,](#page-7-0) after a 12 h UER reaction, the current remained stable without any noticeable drop, demonstrating the catalyst's stability during UER. Similarly, in the UOR reaction with a refreshed electrolyte, the UOR can keep a stable anodic current density (≈20 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2) for more than 39 h, indicating the catalyst's ability to maintain stability during UOR. The overall UOR performance of Ni-In2O3-a is higher than that of most of the recorded Ni-based catalysts (Figure S32, Supporting Information). The XRD patterns of the used catalysts for both the UER and UOR reactions (Figure S35, Supporting Information) did not show any obvious second-phase peaks apart from the major peaks from the catalysts and substrate. Figure S36 (Supporting Information) displays the XPS spectra of the Ni-In2O3 a catalyst following the stability test. In Figure S36a,d (Supporting Information), the deconvoluted peaks correspond to lattice oxygen, oxygen vacancies, and adsorbed oxygen species, highlighting the stability of oxygen vacancies under electrocatalytic conditions. Figure S36b (Supporting Information) and e show the characteristic peaks of Ni<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup>, confirming the presence of active nickel oxidation states. Figure S36c,f (Supporting Information) present the binding energy associated with In3<sup>+</sup>, demonstrating the retention of the In2O3 structure after the stability test, thereby confirming the structural integrity and durability of the catalyst. The SEM image depicts the surface morphology of the Ni-In2O3-a catalyst after long-term electrolysis (Figure S37, Supporting Information). The catalyst maintains a nanostructured morphology with well-defined cubic or polyhedral-like particles. The image shows that the overall structural integrity of the catalyst is retained after extended electrochemical use, with no significant signs of agglomeration or surface degradation, suggesting the stability of the catalyst under operational conditions. This preservation of nanostructure is critical for sustaining catalytic activity over prolonged periods. This further supports the conclusion that Ni-In2O3-a exhibits excellent stability in both UER and UOR reactions.

#### **2.4. In Situ XAS Analysis**

To further gain insight into the unique Ni-VO local structure on the catalytic process of both UER and UOR, the in situ XAS was measured under working conditions to study the local environment changes of In2O3, Ni-In2O3-a, and Ni-In2O3-b. As for the UER measurement, the applied bias varied from open circuit voltage (OCP) to −0.6 V versus RHE. **Figures [5](#page-9-0)**a and S38a (Supporting Information) show the in situ K-edges XANES of Ni-In2O3-a and Ni-In2O3-b, respectively. As for the sample Ni-In2O3-b, it could be seen that the absorption onset position at various biases shows almost no change. However, from Figure [5a,](#page-9-0) it can be seen that the absorption onset shows some negative shift with the bias increase. This could be better evidenced by the 1st derivative curves of the in situ K-edges XANES, as shown in Figures [5c](#page-9-0) and S38b (Supporting Information). A similar phenomenon could also be evidenced from the In K-edge of In2O3, Ni-In2O3-a, and Ni-In2O3-b, while the 1st derivative Kedges XANES curves of Ni-In2O3-a show the most apparent shifting compared with other two samples (Figures S39–S41, Supporting Information). This result suggests that a Ni-VO structure with proper Ni concentration will greatly promote the efficient delocalized electron transfer to the Ni and In caused by the formation of VO, which then participates in the UER reaction.[\[39\]](#page-11-0) Taking a look at that interface between the catalyst and the \*COONH2 which is one of the key intermediates, such delocalised-electrons enriched the electron near the M (M refers to Ni and In) atoms could significantly contribute to the adsorption of the O atoms from \*COONH2, and therefore promote the following hydrogenation processes (Figure [5g,h\)](#page-9-0). Such an enhanced adsorption process is also evidenced by the shrunken distance of the M– O shell with various biases (as shown in Figures [5d](#page-9-0) and S38c, Supporting Information). Compared with In2O3 and Ni-In2O3 b, Ni-In2O3-a shows the most apparent shrinking. Since the adsorption of \*COONH2 on M atoms will extract electrons from M atoms to form new M–O interactions, it will reduce the electron density with the original M─O shell, causing a shrunken M-O distance.[\[39–40\]](#page-11-0) The coordination number (CN) can also support this conclusion since the Ni─O and In─O CN of Ni-In2O3-a are enlarged compared with the other two samples, indicating the unique Ni–Vo local structure could greatly promote the PDS of UER.

In the context of the UOR, it is evident that, compared to Ni-In2O3-b, the Ni-In2O3-a sample exhibits a more pronounced

positively shifted onset energy, as observed from both the in situ XANES and their corresponding 1st derivatives (Figures 5b and S44, Supporting Information). This observation suggests that under UOR conditions, the Ni-In2O3-a sample still facilitates betterlocalised charge transfer compared to the other samples. Turning our focus to the catalyst-interface interaction during UOR, as shown in Figure 5i, it is apparent that, unlike UER, the critical intermediate \*CO(NH2)2 adsorbs to the catalysts through the newly formed M-N interaction. This interaction subsequently transfers electrons to the N─H bond for the deprotonation process. The in situ XAS results further support this process. Figures 5f and S42 (Supporting Information) show that under working conditions, as the bias increases, both the In─O and Ni─O shells shrink, indicating a decrease in electron density. This suggests that during the UOR process, electrons are extracted from the originally electron-rich M─O shell. This effect is induced by the unique Ni–VO local structure. However, in the case of In2O3 and Ni-In2O3-b (Figures S43–S45, Supporting Information), such processes are much weaker compared to Ni-In2O3-a. This leads to an unsatisfactory reaction performance in those samples. The enhanced M-N interaction is further supported by the significantly decreased M-O coordination number of Ni-In2O3-a compared to the other two samples. Consequently, it can be concluded that constructing Ni-In2O3 with a unique Ni-VO local structure is crucial for achieving a catalyst suitable for both UER and UOR. Most importantly, optimizing the Ni-In2O3 catalyst with an appropriate Ni-VO concentration is vital to trigger efficient intermediates' adsorption and catalytic processes, thus maximizing catalytic performance.

### **3. Conclusion**

In summary, we successfully fabricated a bi-functional Ni-In2O3 catalyst with excellent activity for both the UOR and simultaneous UER using a facile hydrothermal method. This catalyst exhibited an outstanding UOR anodic current density of 100 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2, achieved at a low bias of 1.35 V versus RHE. Additionally, it demonstrated a urea yield rate of 668 μg h<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> gcat<sup>−</sup>1, coupled with a faradic efficiency of 19.6%. In addition, the catalyst displayed outstanding stability for both UER and UOR. Leveraging computational assistance, it offers an efficient approach to control the local electronic structure of Ni-In2O3 to align with the requirements of both UER and UOR. Studies of the mechanism by collaborating in situ XAS technologies reveal that the highly enhanced electrochemical performance originates from the synergistic effect of the unique Ni-VO structure. Furthermore, our DFT results showed that when optimized in concentration, the Ni-Vo structure substantially reduced energy barriers for both processes. This work offers a novel perspective on developing efficient electrocatalysts, utilizing computational insights to drive sustainable urea production and electrooxidation processes. These findings hold significant promise, carrying profound eco-economic implications for future urea production and electrochemical technologies applications.

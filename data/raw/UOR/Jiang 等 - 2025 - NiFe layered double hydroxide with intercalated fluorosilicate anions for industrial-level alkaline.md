Seawater electrolysis for hydrogen production is efficient and promising, but chloride ions (Cl $^-$ ) cause severe anode corrosion, limiting its potential. In this study, we present the intercalation of fluorosilicate anions into NiFe layered double hydroxide nanosheet arrays on Ni foam (SiF $_6^{2-}$ -NiFe LDH/NF) as an industrial-level alkaline seawater oxidation catalyst. SiF $_6^{2-}$ -NiFe LDH/NF achieves a current density of 1000 mA cm $^2$  at an overpotential of 371 mV and maintains good stability for 1000 h. It also exhibits robust stability at higher current densities of 1.5 and 2 A cm $^2$ . In situ Raman spectroscopy confirms that SiF $_6^{2-}$  promotes the generation of  $\gamma$ -NiOOH and repels Cl $^-$ , demonstrating excellent tolerance under extreme conditions.

Hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) is considered a highly promising and environmentally friendly substitute for fossil fuels.<sup>1-3</sup> Water electrolysis is a technology that uses freshwater and renewable electricity to produce high-purity and green H<sub>2</sub>, serving as a cleaner substitute for traditional industrial methods.<sup>4-11</sup> However, it requires the consumption of freshwater resources, which undoubtedly aggravates global freshwater scarcity. Seawater, being the most abundant resource on Earth, holds great potential as a sustainable long-term feedstock for H<sub>2</sub>

production. <sup>12–20</sup> Despite its great potential, seawater electrolysis still faces a major challenge of poor stability caused by chloride ion (Cl $^-$ ) corrosion, which seriously limits its widespread application. The chlorine evolution reaction (CER) is bound to occur even in alkaline seawater owing to the high concentration of Cl $^-$  and high overpotential ( $\eta$ ). This reduces the faradaic efficiency (FE) of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and causes the production of more harmful hypochlorite. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop efficient and Cl $^-$ repelling anodic catalysts performing stably at ampere-level j.

NiFe-layered double hydroxide (NiFe LDH) is a highly promising material that has attracted much attention owing to its exceptional activity and low cost, making it an ideal alternative to noble-containing materials for seawater electrolysis. 14,21-25 During the alkaline seawater oxidation (ASO) process, NiFe LDH will generate high-valent Ni species (e.g.,  $\gamma$ -NiOOH), which serve as the true active site of the catalyst. However, the abundance of Cl and active chlorine species can cause corrosion, leading to catalyst deactivation and compromising its stability. Recently, considerable efforts have been undertaken to explore oxygen-containing anions with large ionic radii, such as MoO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>, C<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>, PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup>, W<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub><sup>2-</sup>, CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup>, WO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> and SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>, as modifiers for LDH to effectively inhibit the corrosion caused by Cl via electrostatic repulsion, leading to enhanced stability during the ASO process.<sup>26-32</sup> Fluorinated anions possess substantially large ionic radii and, thus, are promising for use in ASO catalysis, but very limited efforts have been undertaken to investigate their effect in improving the stability of anodic catalysts in alkaline seawater. Our research has shown that the intercalation of  $TaF_7^{2-}$  and SbF<sub>6</sub> into layered double hydroxides can exhibit strong stability and OER activity in alkaline environments, especially in the application of anode catalysts. 33,34

Herein, we describe our recent efforts in this direction in developing fluorosilicate anion-intercalated NiFe LDH nanosheet arrays on Ni foam (SiF $_6^{2-}$ -NiFe LDH/NF) for ASO. *In/ex situ* spectroscopic analyses indicate that SiF $_6^{2-}$  not only

promotes the formation of γ-NiOOH but also prevents the adsorption of Cl<sup>-</sup>. SiF<sub>6</sub><sup>2-</sup>-NiFe LDH/NF achieves a j of 1000 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> at a low  $\eta$  of only 371 mV to accomplish and maintain stable operation for 1000 h with negligible activity degradation. It also remains stable for 500 h at higher j (1.5 and 2 A cm<sup>-2</sup>). This study offers a promising strategy for improving the stability of NiFe LDH toward seawater oxidation electrocatalysis.

Fig. 1a illustrates the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of SiF<sub>6</sub><sup>2</sup>-NiFe LDH/NF, showing obvious peaks characteristic of NiFe LDH/NF (JCPDS No. 40-0215).35 For the (003) plane of SiF<sub>6</sub><sup>2-</sup>-NiFe LDH/NF, the corresponding peak is shifted by 0.2° as compared with NiFe LDH/NF in Fig. 1b, suggesting an enlargement of the layer spacing and no generation of new material.<sup>36,37</sup> According to the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images, the NF (Fig. S1†) substrate achieves full surface coverage through the growth of vertically aligned NiFe LDH nanosheets (Fig. S2†), and SiF<sub>6</sub><sup>2-</sup>-NiFe LDH/NF (Fig. 1c) retains the characteristics. SEM and the corresponding energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) elemental mapping images of SiF<sub>6</sub><sup>2-</sup>-NiFe LDH/NF (Fig. 1d) illustrate the distribution of the elements Ni, Fe, O, F, and Si.38 The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image (Fig. 1e) also demonstrates that SiF<sub>6</sub><sup>2</sup>-NiFe LDH/NF maintains the morphology of the nanosheets. The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image (Fig. 1f) exhibits a lattice stripe spacing (0.295 nm), which is

very close to the (101) plane of NiFe LDH. A comprehensive analysis of these test results confirmed that SiF<sub>6</sub><sup>2-</sup> has been successfully adsorbed on NiFe LDH nanosheet arrays.

Fig. 2a shows the XPS spectra of the Ni 2p region (Fig. 2a) of SiF<sub>6</sub><sup>2-</sup>-NiFe LDH. The two trace peaks at 854.9 and 873.6 eV are related to Ni 2p<sub>3/2</sub> and Ni 2p<sub>1/2</sub>, belonging to Ni<sup>2+</sup>; the shoulder peaks are observed at 856.9 and 876.1 eV, corresponding to Ni<sup>3+</sup>. The binding energies at 862.4 and 880 eV are related to satellite peaks (denoted as "Sat."). 39,40 The Fe 2p spectra (Fig. 2b) show the  $Fe^{3+} 2p_{1/2}$  (725.6 eV) and  $Fe^{3+}$ 2p<sub>3/2</sub> (712.4 eV) regions, and the binding energies of 718.9 and 706.8 eV related to  $\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$   $2p_{1/2}$  and  $\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$   $2p_{3/2}$ . The peaks at 714.3 and 727.3 eV also belong to Sat. peaks. Notably, the SiF<sub>6</sub><sup>2-</sup>-NiFe LDH is shifted to higher binding energies by 0.32 and 0.38 eV in the Ni 2p and Fe 2p spectra, respectively. The O 1s spectrum (Fig. 2c) exhibits three different peaks at 532.8, 531.3, and 529.7 eV associated with adsorbed oxygen (O<sub>ad</sub>), metal-OH, and metal-O in SiF<sub>6</sub><sup>2-</sup>-NiFe LDH, respectively. 44,45 In the F 1s region (Fig. 2d), the characteristic peak observed at 686 eV indicates the influence of the Si-F bond, while the peak located at 688 eV is associated with organic fluoride. 46-48

We first tested the OER activity of SiF<sub>6</sub><sup>2-</sup>-NiFe LDH/NF in 1 M KOH electrolyte. The linear scanning voltammetry (LSV) curves (Fig. 3a) show that SiF<sub>6</sub><sup>2-</sup>-NiFe LDH/NF outperforms other catalysts. The  $\eta$  of SiF<sub>6</sub><sup>2</sup>-NiFe LDH/NF at a j of 100 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> is 266 mV, which exhibits a lower requirement compared to 273, 329, and 490 mV needed for other comparative electrodes. SiF<sub>6</sub><sup>2-</sup>-NiFe LDH/NF exhibits the highest activity (LSV curves without iR compensation are shown in Fig. S3†). Notably, the Tafel slope of SiF<sub>6</sub><sup>2</sup>-NiFe LDH/NF was measured to be 27.79 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>, which is lower than the previous comparison samples. This demonstrates faster reaction kinetics and higher OER activity for SiF<sub>6</sub><sup>2-</sup>-NiFe

LDH/NF (Fig. 3b). 49,50 Furthermore, we tested the effects of different Na2SiF6 concentrations and immersion times on the OER performance; the best OER activity was observed at 0.05 M at an immersion time of 10 minutes (Fig. S4†). Electrochemical impedance tests (Fig. 3c) show that SiF<sub>6</sub><sup>2-</sup> NiFe LDH/NF has a smaller semicircle, indicating it has lower resistance, faster charge transfer rate, and greater OER kinetics. The Nyquist and Bode plots in the voltage range of 1.42 to 1.72 V (Fig. S5†), SiF<sub>6</sub><sup>2-</sup>-NiFe LDH/NF exhibit a smaller phase angle, so that SiF<sub>6</sub><sup>2</sup>-NiFe LDH/NF can polarize more easily than LDH/NF. Besides, the  $R_{ct}$  for  $SiF_6^{2-}$ -NiFe LDH/NF and the comparison sample are 3.28 and 4.27  $\Omega$ , respectively, indicating that SiF<sub>6</sub><sup>2-</sup>-NiFe LDH/NF has higher electron conduction efficiency and more favorable charge transfer resistance (Table S1†). Compared with NiFe LDH/NF (5.32 mF cm<sup>-1</sup>), the  $C_{\rm dl}$  value of SiF<sub>6</sub><sup>2-</sup>-NiFe LDH/NF (6.93 mF cm<sup>-1</sup>) is larger (Fig. 3d and S6†), suggesting a larger effective surface area. The LSV curves of SiF<sub>6</sub><sup>2</sup>-NiFe LDH/NF and NiFe LDH/NF, normalized by the electrochemically active surface area (Fig. S7†), demonstrate that the OER performance of SiF<sub>6</sub><sup>2-</sup>-NiFe LDH/NF surpasses that of NiFe LDH/NF. According to the multistep chronopotentiometric curve of SiF<sub>6</sub><sup>2-</sup>-NiFe LDH/NF in Fig. S8,† it can maintain basic stability at different j, demonstrating its excellent mechanical stability mass transfer.<sup>51</sup> We also verified that after 5000 turns of cyclic voltammetry (CV) activation, the LSV curve of SiF<sub>6</sub><sup>2-</sup>-NiFe LDH/NF is not much different from the one measured at the beginning, which further proves its excellent stability (Fig. S9†). We calculated the turnover frequencies (TOF) and also proved that SiF<sub>6</sub><sup>2-</sup>-NiFe LDH/NF has high intrinsic catalytic activity (Fig. 3e and S10†). The calculated electrochemical activation energy value of SiF<sub>6</sub><sup>2-</sup>-NiFe LDH/ NF is 41.89 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>, which is lower than that of the comparison sample (Fig. 3f and S11†), indicating its excellent electrical conductivity and catalytic activity.

In Fig. 4a, overpotentials with different j are shown under different electrolyte conditions, with the minimum  $\eta$  required to achieve the specified current density in 1 M KOH. The OER activity of NiFe LDH/NF is enhanced after the intercalation of SiF<sub>6</sub><sup>2-</sup> (Fig. S12†). We compared the mass activity (MA) of SiF<sub>6</sub><sup>2-</sup>-NiFe LDH/NF and NiFe LDH/NF in Fig. S13;† SiF<sub>6</sub><sup>2</sup>-NiFe LDH/NF has higher mass activity, suggesting that it has better catalytic performance. Furthermore, during the ASO process, in situ Raman spectroscopy was performed to investigate the structural evolution. The spectra reveal peaks at 462 and 532 cm<sup>-1</sup> for  $SiF_6^{2-}$ -NiFe LDH/NF, and at 456 and 529 cm<sup>-1</sup> for NiFe LDH/ NF, which are indicative of v(Ni<sup>2+</sup>-O) vibrations.<sup>52</sup> With increasing applied potential, the LDH underwent oxidation, leading to the formation of a catalytically active γ-NiOOH phase. Fig. 4b and c show the observed shift in Raman peaks to higher wavenumbers; this phase is characterized by  $\delta(\text{Ni}^{3+}-\text{O})$  and  $\nu(\text{Ni}^{3+}-\text{O})$  vibrations. 53,54 Notably, SiF<sub>6</sub><sup>2-</sup>-NiFe LDH/NF exhibited an earlier peak shift (at 1.5 V) compared to the comparison sample (at 1.6 V), indicating that SiF<sub>6</sub><sup>2-</sup> is beneficial for the formation of  $\gamma$ -NiOOH. Most importantly, SiF<sub>6</sub><sup>2-</sup>-NiFe LDH/NF shows superior stability and can operate stably at j of 1000 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> for up to 1000 h (Fig. 4d). Moreover, it is stable for 500 h at higher j of both 1.5 and 2 A cm<sup>-2</sup> (Fig. S14†). In contrast, NiFe LDH/NF begins to decline after 130 h at 1000 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. We also synthesized several other LDHs (e.g., CoFe LDH/NF and NiCo LDH/NF) and the corresponding SiF<sub>6</sub><sup>2-</sup>-intercalated samples to demonstrate that boosting the stability of LDHs via SiF<sub>6</sub><sup>2-</sup> intercalation should be a general route. As illustrated in Fig. S15,† both SiF<sub>6</sub><sup>2-</sup>-CoFe LDH/NF and SiF<sub>6</sub><sup>2-</sup>-NiCo LDH/NF exhibit excellent long-term stability, maintaining operation for 500 h at 1000 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, thereby suggesting the effectiveness of SiF<sub>6</sub><sup>2-</sup> in inhibiting the detrimental chlorine electrochemistry. In addition, SiF<sub>6</sub><sup>2-</sup>-NiFe LDH/NF exhibits relatively higher activity with lower  $\eta$  compared to many reported OER catalysts in Fig. 4e and Table S2.† After performing drainage testing, we found that the amount of O2 gas manufactured by SiF<sub>6</sub><sup>2-</sup>-NiFe LDH/NF in alkaline seawater is very close to the calculated amount of O2 gas (Fig. S16†). The FE is about 97.4%, demonstrating that SiF<sub>6</sub><sup>2-</sup>-NiFe LDH/NF is highly selective. We measured the active chlorine content in the electrolyte using the DPD method55 and obtained the UVvisible calibration curve of chlorine (Fig. S17 and S18†). After

the test of stability, the active chlorine concentration of SiF<sub>6</sub><sup>2-</sup>-NiFe LDH/NF was relatively lower, indicating the importance of SiF<sub>6</sub><sup>2-</sup> intercalation. After the durability test, the SEM images of SiF<sub>6</sub><sup>2</sup>-NiFe LDH/NF (Fig. S19†) were obtained, which further confirmed the stability of its structure, and the XRD patterns indicated that the peaks of SiF<sub>6</sub><sup>2-</sup>-NiFe LDH/NF (Fig. S20†) had disappeared. ICP-MS analysis of the electrolyte composition demonstrated minimal leaching of Ni, Fe, and Si from the  $SiF_6^{2-}$ -NiFe LDH/ NF (Table S3†), confirming its enhanced structural stability compared to NiFe LDH/NF (Table S4†). The increased content of high valent Ni3+ and Fe3+ suggests that Ni and Fe are highly oxidized in the ASO process (Fig. S21†). To investigate the oxygen evolution reaction pathways on the catalytic systems, we analyzed two distinct mechanistic frameworks, namely, the adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM) and the lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM) (Fig. 4f and S22†). Computational analysis revealed that SiF<sub>6</sub><sup>2-</sup>-NiFe LDH demonstrates distinct mechanistic preferences; the kinetic bottleneck in the AEM pathway occurs during the \*OH to \*O deprotonation step ( $\Delta G = 2$  eV), while the LOM pathway encounters greater energetic challenges during oxygen molecule formation ( $\Delta G = 2.58$  eV). This establishes AEM as the predominant OER pathway for SiF<sub>6</sub><sup>2-</sup>-NiFe LDH, and the overpotential is 0.77 V.14 Similarly, for NiFe LDH, its OER is also carried out through the AEM pathway, with an overpotential of 0.83 V. Therefore, SiF<sub>6</sub><sup>2-</sup>-NiFe LDH exhibits higher OER catalytic performance due to its lower SiF<sub>6</sub><sup>2-</sup>-NiFe LDH overpotential through AEM. The demonstrated a substantially weaker \*Cl binding affinity  $(E_{\rm ads} = -0.45 \text{ eV})$  compared to its unmodified counterpart ( $E_{\rm ads}$  = -2.41 eV). This marked difference in adsorption strength quantitatively confirms the enhanced chlorine resistance of the SiF<sub>6</sub><sup>2-</sup>-NiFe LDH, as visualized in the supporting electrochemical characterization data (Fig. 4g). The attenuated \*Cl adsorption capacity synergistically contributes to the catalyst's operational stability in chloridecontaining environments. Corrosion polarization curves (Fig. 4h) and the corresponding corrosion potential diagram (Fig. S23†) show that the corrosion potential of  ${\rm SiF_6}^{2-}$ -NiFe LDH/NF (342 mV) is higher than the comparison sample (298 mV), indicating that the former has stronger resistance to chloride-induced corrosion.

To assess the industrial viability of the catalyst, we assembled a membrane-based electrolysis cell integrating Pt/C/NF electrodes and an anion exchange membrane (AEM) as a testing platform. As shown in Fig. S24a,† SiF<sub>6</sub><sup>2-</sup>-NiFe LDH/NF||Pt/C/NF exhibits lower cell voltages compared to RuO<sub>2</sub>/NF||Pt/C/NF. Moreover, the SiF<sub>6</sub><sup>2-</sup>-NiFe LDH/NF||Pt/C/NF electrolyzer demonstrates stability at 300 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> for 150 hours, whereas the latter electrolyzer operated for only 70 hours (Fig. S24b†), providing strong evidence that the incorporation of SiF<sub>6</sub><sup>2-</sup> enhances stability and supports its industrial viability.

In summary,  ${\rm SiF_6}^{2-}$  intercalation can greatly enhance the corrosion resistance of NiFe LDH in alkaline seawater.  ${\rm SiF_6}^{2-}$ -NiFe LDH/NF achieves an industrial-grade j of 1000 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> with a low  $\eta$  of 371 mV and operates stably for 1000 h in alkaline seawater. Moreover, it is also capable of maintaining long-term stability at higher j (1.5 and 2 A cm<sup>-2</sup>). This work is important because it offers an earth-abundant ASO catalyst for applications and provides a new hexafluoro anion as a catalyst modifier  $^{33,34}$  or electrolyte additive  $^{56}$  for effective Cl<sup>-</sup> repulsion.

[Niteesh Kumar,](https://orcid.org/0009-0007-9563-6499) Lalita Wagh, Sajid Mehmood, [Apurba K. Das,](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8141-6854) and [Tanmay Kumar Ghorai\\*](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8758-7956)

Developing resilient and robust electrocatalysts devoid of noble metals is vital for facilitating the generation of O2/H2 from water electrolysis, particularly in catalyzing oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR), respectively. Nickelbased catalysts have attracted as part of global efforts to produce hydrogen from urea-rich wastewater due to their high reaction rates and favorable long-term stability. Two new mononuclear NiII-embedded complexes, namely, [C26H38NiN4O4] (Complex 1) and [C24H32NiF2N4O2] (Complex 2), are explored as a bifunctional catalyst for the OER and UOR herein. Complexes 1 and 2 crystallize in triclinic and monoclinic with space group

P1 (2) & P 21/c (14), respectively. The OER outcomes of Complex 1 exhibit excellent performance, featuring a lower overpotential of 220 mV and reduced Tafel slope value of 82 mV dec<sup>1</sup> at a benchmarking current density of 10 mA cm<sup>2</sup> in 1 M KOH compared to Complex 2. Additionally, the results of UOR indicate that Complex 1 only requires 1.30 V potential to achieve the same current density which is significantly lower than other counterparts and most reported materials. Chronopotentiometry analysis reveals that Complex 1 is stable up to a longer period of 100 and 20 h in 1 M KOH and alkaline urea electrolyte, respectively.

# 1. Introduction

The exploration of green and renewable energy sources is a significant endeavor aimed at addressing environmental challenges and global energy demands. The electrocatalytic reaction for water splitting has emerged as an auspicious method for generating hydrogen in the context of alternative, clean energy technologies.[1–3] Within the two key processes of water splitting, namely O2 evolution at the anode and H2 evolution at the cathode, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) process encounters difficulties due to a slow four-electron transfer mechanism and elevated overpotential. These challenges contribute to the intricacy and sluggishness of the reaction pathway.[4–6] Hence, there is an immediate need for an efficient method that surpasses the constraints of OER by incorporating readily oxidizable sacrificial molecules. The electrochemical UOR is gaining significant interest for its application in the treatment of wastewater. UOR is particularly fascinating due to its remarkably low decomposition voltage (0.37 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)), a notable contrast to the higher voltage required for electrocatalytic water splitting (1.23 V vs. RHE). This characteristic enables an impressive 70% theoretical energy saving, and more importantly, the urea

oxidation reaction (UOR) possesses the capability to synergistically address pollution concerns while concurrently producing hydrogen energy.[7–9] Considering this understanding, waterbased electrolysis has been suggested for the treatment of urea-rich wastewater, comprising oxidation of urea at the anode while H2 generation at the cathode. Urea undergoes electrocatalytic oxidation at the anode, resulting in the oxidation of urea to nitrogen and conversion to carbon dioxide. Concurrently, a typical H2 evolution occurs at the cathode, as described in reaction equations.[10,11]

Anode: 
$$CO(NH_2)_2 + 6OH^- \rightarrow 5H_2O + N_2 + CO_2 + 6e^-$$

Cathode: 
$$6H_2O + 6e^- \rightarrow 3H_2 + 6OH^-$$
 (2)

Overall reaction: 
$$CO(NH_2)_2 + H_2O \rightarrow 3H_2 + N_2 + CO_2$$
 (3)

It is important to mention that the UOR involves a transfer of six electrons, and its reaction kinetics remain considerably sluggish.[12–14] Primarily, noble metals, like Pt, Ru, and Ir, stand out as the most efficient electrocatalysts for the electro-oxidation of urea.[15,16] RuO2 and IrO2 were widely used for OER.[17] The limited availability and high production costs of these catalysts make them economically less viable for practical implementation in OER and UOR. Hence, it is pivotal to establish inexpensive and flexible electrocatalysts enabling cost-effective OER and UOR. 3d transition metals are extensively employed to enhance OER activity due to the relatively weak bond strength of the intermediates formed during the reaction. This characteristic significantly improves the kinetics and efficiency of the electrocatalyst. Generally, HO─M2<sup>þ</sup> bond strength typically follows the sequence Mn > Fe > Co > Ni. The diminished bond strength of HO─Ni in intermediates (MOOH) arises from elevated electronelectron repulsion.[18,19] Generally, weaker bond strength is associated with a higher performance of the electrocatalysts. Many of the reported non-noble electrocatalysts, including coordination complexes and metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), demonstrate significant OER and UOR.[13,20–23]

In the past few years, nickel-based electrocatalysts have risen as surprising candidates due to their exceptional activity and stability for OER and UOR.[3,4,24,25] Maoxiao et al. reported Ni2P/Ni0.96S heterostructured electrocatalysts for urea oxidation at the anode and H2 evolution at the cathode.[10] Zhang and his group reported a bifunctional electrocatalyst, namely [NiFe(OH)x/Ni3N] for OER (overpotential = 260 mV at 10 mA cm<sup>2</sup> ) and UOR (Potential = 1.36 V at 10 mA cm<sup>2</sup> ).[26] Geng et al. reported Ni foam-supported [Ni2Fe(CN)6] catalyst which drives the UOR with an enhanced reactivity and better stability.[7] Pan et al. developed hydrophilic electrocatalysts of carbon-encapsulated nickel nanoparticles with better activity and stability against UOR.[27] Han's group reported a highly stable MOF{Ni12}, it exhibits 342 mV overpotential to attain a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>2</sup> in a basic solution.[28] Anthony and co-workers reported Ni-MOF and Ni-C for their excellent electrocatalytic activity toward OER by converting to nickel hydroxides/oxyhydroxides during electrolysis.[29] The development of electrocatalysts utilizing NiII complexes is still underway, and the role of active sites in the initiation of catalytic activity with 3d elements remains unclear. Primary goal of our research is to create affordable transition metal complexes designed as dual and efficient electrocatalysts for OER and UOR.

Our research group focused on the synthesis of coordination materials that have multifunctional activity toward electrochemical reactions. Recently, we have reported Cu2 II and Mn2 III complexes as an electroactive material for HER and OER in acidic and alkaline medium, respectively.[30] Based on the strategic design, we adopt a facile and simple slow evaporation approach to prepare single crystals of two mononuclear NiII complexes, with two different Schiff bases (N2O donor). Both complexes underwent characterization using various standard techniques along with single X-ray crystallography. Further, we wish to report the electrocatalytic OER and UOR activity of NiII complexes in an alkaline medium. Complex 1 displays superior electrocatalytic activity with a small overpotential of 220 mV and a lower Tafel value of 82 mV dec<sup>1</sup> at 10 mA cm<sup>2</sup> for OER. Additionally, Complex 1 also delivers 10 mA cm<sup>2</sup> at 1.30 V versus RHE for UOR. Finally, our study outlines a comprehensive method for assessing the efficacy of synthesized mononuclear nickel complexes as novel electrocatalysts exhibited better OER and UOR activity by getting low overpotential value, particularly in alkaline electrolytes.

# 2. Results and Discussion

### 2.1. Synthesis and Characterization

Mononuclear nickel complexes were synthesized through a single-pot reaction. 3-methoxy-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (O-vanillin), 3-(dimethylamino)-1-propylamine and nickel chloride hexahydrate was dissolved in methanol in the ratio of 2:2:1 to produce mononuclear Complex 1. Similarly, for the synthesis of Complex 2, we used 5-fluorosalicylaldehyde instead of O-vanillin, while all other conditions remained constant. Elemental analysis, Fouriertransform infrared (FTIR), and UV–visible spectroscopy indicated the formation of complexes. Molecular structure determination via single-X-ray diffraction further validated the design of two mononuclear nickel complexes. The synthetic route map of Complex 1 and Complex 2 is depicted in Scheme 1.

refinement particulars for both complexes are documented in Table S1, Supporting Information. Critical bond distances and bond angles for both mononuclear nickel complexes are listed in Table S2 and S3, Supporting Information, respectively.

Ligand 2-(((3-(dimethylamino)propyl)imino)methyl)-6-methoxyphenol (HL<sup>1</sup> ) and 2-(((3-(dimethylamino)propyl)imino)methyl)- 4-fluorophenol (HL<sup>2</sup> ) have been used to grow two nickel complexes Complex 1 and Complex 2, respectively, by simple slow evaporation methods in methanol. Notably, Reza and co-workers reported the structural determination of some new NiII complexes containing tridentate N2O and ONO Schiff base ligand.[31] Recently Liu and his group reported Schiff basecontaining NiII-complex with their crystal structure and antimicrobial activity.[32] Figure 1 and 2 provide a perspective depiction of molecular structure showcasing a partial atom numbering scheme of Complex 1 and Complex 2, respectively. Complex 1 is a centrosymmetric mononuclear nickel complex in which one nickel center is connected via two phenolate oxygen (O1 and O1') atoms of two deprotonated Schiff base ligand units (L1 ). Nitrogen atoms N1 and N2, as well as N1' and N2', coordinated with the Ni1 atom. The distorted octahedral geometry of hexa-coordinated nickel(II) ion with N2O donor of two Schiff's base ligand molecules was confirmed by X-ray crystallography. Recently, Narcis and his co-workers developed single crystals of two new hexacoordinated nickel complexes using the Schiff base in the presence of triethylamine for their magnetic studies.[33] The crystallographic structure of Complex 1 revealed that Ni atom occupied the octahedron's equatorial plane. Furthermore, the basal plane consisted of two nitrogen atoms of the azomethine group and two phenolic oxygen atoms from the O-vanillin moiety. The axial positions of the distorted octahedron were occupied by the nitrogen atoms containing dimethyl groups in the Schiff base. The axial bond lengths such that Ni1─N2 and Ni1─N2' were observed for Complex 1 to be 2.305(3) Å. Moreover, a bond length of 2.054(2) Å was determined for the equatorial bonds Ni─N1 and Ni─N1', indicating a greater bond length than the equatorial

Ni—O1 and Ni—O1' bonds (2.009(2) Å) in Complex 1. In Complex 1, the *cis* angles O1—Ni1—N1 and O1'—Ni1—N1' are present at 87.86 (10)°, whereas the *trans* angles, N2—Ni1—N2', N1—Ni1—N1', and O1—Ni1—O1' are seen to be at 180°. The octahedral geometry of the nickel(II) complex exhibits a minor deformation as seen by the cis angles of Complex 1 that vary from 90°. The two Schiff base ligands linked with the nickel atom in Complex 1 form the chair conformation.

The crystal structure of Complex 2 showed a six-coordinated nickel(II) ion with N<sub>2</sub>O donor of two units of ligand HL<sup>2</sup> in an octahedral geometry. Complex 2 is also symmetrical in which one Ni<sup>II</sup> ion coordinated with four nitrogen atoms (N1, N2, N3, and N4) and two phenolate oxygen (O1 and O2) atoms of two deprotonated Schiff base ligand units (L<sup>2</sup>). The two fluorinated Schiff base ligands linked with nickel atom in Complex 2 to form the chair conformation. Complex 2 showed that the Ni<sup>II</sup> ion was positioned within the equatorial plane of the octahedron, as well as two phenolic and two azomethine groups at the basal plane. Nitrogen atoms constituting the dimethyl group in HL<sup>2</sup> occupy an axial position of the deformed octahedron. The axial bond lengths such as Ni1-N2 and Ni1-N4 were found to be 2.316 (3) and 2.307 (3) Å, respectively. Equatorial bonds Ni—N1 and Ni—N3 in Complex 2 were found to have lengths of 2.055 (3) and 2.046 (3) Å, respectively, which exceed the lengths of equatorial Ni-O2 and Ni-O1 bonds, measured at 2.016 (2) Å.

In Complex 2, the *cis* angles O1–Ni1–N1 and O2–Ni1–N3 are present at 87.81 (11)° and 88.47 (11)°, respectively. *Trans* angles N1–Ni1–N3, O1–Ni1–O2, and N2–Ni1–N4 are present at 179.96 (16)° 179.30 (10)°, and 179.43 (11)° respectively. The *cis* and *trans* angles of Complex 2 deviate from 90° and 180°, indicating a modest contortion in the octahedral geometry of the Ni<sup>II</sup> center.

Figure S1a,b, Supporting Information depict the unit cell diagram of Complex 1 and Complex 2. Complex 1 exhibits an asymmetric unit, as depicted in Figure S2, Supporting Information, while, Complex 2 has no asymmetric unit. Perspective views of the molecular packing structures of Complex 1 and Complex 2, along with the different crystallographic axes, are displayed in Figure S3 and S4, Supporting Information, respectively. Oxidation states of the Ni<sup>II</sup> center in Complex 1 and Complex 2 were found using bond valence sum (BVS) methods.<sup>[34]</sup> According to the estimated BVS data, the oxidation state of the nickel atom in Complex 1 as well as Complex 2 is +2 (Table 1). Oxidation states of both Ni<sup>II</sup>-complexes 1 and 2 were also confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) investigation (Figure S5, Supporting Information for Complex 1 and Figure S6, Supporting Information for Complex 2).

## 2.3. Electronic Spectral Analysis of Complex 1 and Complex 2

The absorption spectral data of both Ni<sup>II</sup> complexes were investigated in freshly prepared acetonitrile solution in the 1100–190 nm range (Figure S7, Supporting Information). In the UV region of Complex 1 (1.05 × 10<sup>-4</sup> M) and Complex 2 (1.1 × 10<sup>-4</sup> M), peaks were observed between 220 and 250 nm attributed to the  $\pi \to \pi^*$  (C=N) transition originating from the Schiff base ligand. From the UV–vis absorption of Complex 1 and Complex 2, one broad/shoulder peak at 378 and 383 nm, respectively, this peak likely corresponds to ligand–to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) transition. Nickel center present in both complexes has a + 2-oxidation state, which is a 3 $d^8$  octahedral system, and  ${}^3F_{4}$  is the ground-state term. It splits into  ${}^3A_{2g}$ ,  ${}^3T_{2g}$ , and  ${}^3T_{1g}$  energy states. Here,  ${}^3A_{2g} \to {}^3T_{1g}$  (P) is the only allowed transition that gives lower energy at 378 & 383 nm due to LMCT for Complex 1 and Complex 2, respectively.

## 2.4. Optical Properties of Complex 1 and Complex 2

The optical properties of isolated complexes 1 and 2 were computed using the Tauc formula to explain the conductivity of the complexes, according to Equation (4).<sup>[30]</sup>

$$(\alpha h v)^n = K(h v - E_q) \tag{4}$$

where  $\alpha$  stands for absorption coefficient, this is evaluated as  $\alpha=(2.303\,$  absorption)/t, where t is the cuvette thickness (1 cm); K is constant. Highest occupied molecular orbital–lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (HOMO–LUMO) gap is denoted by  $E_{\rm g}$ . The exponent n is determined by the nature of transition, where h stands for Planck's constant. Figure S8a,b, Supporting Information depicts the HOMO–LUMO gap of the catalysts, determined by extrapolating the linear portion of the curve to  $(\alpha h v)^2=0$ . The HOMO–LUMO gap of Complexes 1 and 2 was 2.79 and 2.86 eV, respectively. The lower HOMO–LUMO gap values suggest that the isolated complexes have semiconducting properties.

## 2.5. Powder X-ray Diffraction (PXRD) of Complexes 1 and 2

Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) experiments were performed on PAN analytical X pert<sup>3</sup> Pro instrument with Bragg-Brentano geometry. Intensity data were collected using an X'Celerator detector, and  $2\theta$  scans were performed in the range of 5–50°. During the experiment, the powdered sample was subjected to Cu Ka ( $\lambda = 1.5418 \,\text{Å}$ ) radiation. The PXRD patterns of the as-synthesized crystalline product Complexes 1 and 2 were recorded in order to examine its phase purity by comparing them to the corresponding simulated spectra measured from the single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD) data. The close agreement of the different peak positions between the simulated and as-synthesized (27 °C) PXRD patterns indicates the high phase purity of the compounds. Figure S10 and S11, Supporting Information show the phase purity of complexes 1 and 2, respectively, which was recorded by the PXRD pattern of the bulk sample and indexed to the simulated pattern.

### 2.6. XPS Analysis of Complexes 1 and 2

The chemical composition and oxidation states of the metal ions in Complexes 1 and 2 was also confirmed using XPS spectra. The XPS signals of Ni are present at (Figure S5a, Supporting Information) 853.5 eV (Ni  $2p_{3/2}$ ) and 870.6 eV (Ni  $2p_{1/2}$ ) in Complex 1. The binding energies of  $Ni2p_{1/2}$  and  $Ni2p_{3/2}$  indicate that the nickel atom is characteristic of a +2 oxidation state in Complex 1.[19] The XPS profile of other atoms in complex 1, that is, C 1s (Figure S5b, Supporting Information) displays the deconvoluted points at 282.4 and 283.9 eV attributed to the existence of C—C/C—N and C=C/C=N bonding interactions. High-resolution O 1s (Figure S5c, Supporting Information) profile shows the presence of peaks at 528.6 and 529.2 eV accredited to the presence of Ni-O and Ni-O-C/H bonding interactions, respectively. N 1s spectrum illustrated three notable peaks located at 396.6, 397.3, and 398.8 eV, representing -C=N, C-N, and Ni-N bonds in Complex 1 which are displayed in Figure S5d, Supporting Information. [19,21,25] The XPS spectra of Ni 2p in Complex 2 (Figure S6a, Supporting Information) can be fit into three peaks at 855.2, and 872.1 eV, which are assigned to Ni<sup>2+</sup> ( $2p_{3/2}$ ), and Ni<sup>2+</sup>  $(2p_{1/2})$ , respectively. The XPS profiles of N 1s and O 1s are exposed in Figure S6b,c, Supporting Information, separately. The highresolution XPS F 1s spectrum (Figure S6d, Supporting Information) exhibits two prominent signals at 684.1 and 684.8 eV, attributed to the presence of C-F bonding.[30]

### 2.7. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) Analysis

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was employed to investigate the morphological behavior of freshly prepared  $[C_{26}H_{38}NiN_4O_4]$  (Complex 1) and  $[C_{24}H_{32}NiF_2N_4O_2]$  (Complex 2) in the solid-state configuration. The morphology of both synthesized nickel(II) complexes appeared like irregular particles. **Figure 3**a,b depicts the SEM images of Complex 1, whereas Figure 3c,d depicts the SEM images of Complex 2 at different magnifications. The SEM images revealed the crystalline nature of the complexes.

### 3. Electrochemical Reaction

## 3.1. Electrocatalytic Performance Toward OER

The performance of Complex 1 and Complex 2 (fabrication of the electrodes discussed in supportive information) in OER was tested in a freshly prepared 1 M KOH electrolyte using a three-electrode setup. An Ag/AgCl was used as the reference electrode and a Pt wire served as the counter electrode. The efficiency of these electrodes was evaluated using various techniques such as linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), Tafel slope, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). LSV curves were plotted at a scan rate of 2 mV s<sup>-1</sup>. The potential values

in this study were stated relative to a RHE using Equation S(1), Supporting Information.

Bare carbon paper (CP), Complex 1, Complex 2, and commercially available  ${\rm RuO_2}$  were all tested under similar conditions for a comparative study. **Figure 4**a displays that bare CP exhibits poor catalytic activity toward OER.  ${\rm RuO_2}$ , on the other hand, shows outstanding activity and only requires a small overpotential of 230 mV at 10 mA cm $^{-2}$  current density. Complex 1 displays high efficiency with a low overpotential value of 220 mV, while Complex 2 requires a higher overpotential of 270 mV to achieve the same current density. Furthermore, this performance matches or even surpasses that of other newly developed OER electrocatalysts (**Table 2**).

The Tafel plots are used in deciphering the catalytic activity and kinetics of OER. The LSV polarization curve was used

to generate these Tafel plots (Figure 4b).  $^{[35,36]}$  The Tafel slope was measured to be  $82\,\mathrm{mV}\,\mathrm{dec^{-1}}$  for Complex 1. On the other hand, the Tafel slope of  $\mathrm{RuO_2}$  was calculated to be  $84\,\mathrm{mV}\,\mathrm{dec^{-1}}$ . However, the Tafel slope value is  $103\,\mathrm{mV}\,\mathrm{dec^{-1}}$  for Complex 2 which is slightly higher than Complex 1. A lower Tafel slope value for Complex 1 signifies its exceptional efficiency, faster OER kinetics, and rapid migration of ions and electrons within the electrolyte during electrochemical measurements.

Figure 4c displays the EIS to analyze the  $R_{\rm ct}$  (charge transfer resistance) and solution resistance ( $R_{\rm s}$ ) for Complex 1 and Complex 2. The small semicircle radius in the Nyquist plot for Complex 1 suggests a small  $R_{\rm ct}$  and high catalytic activity toward the OER. The fitted  $R_{\rm ct}$  values are 6.55 and 16.8  $\Omega$  for

Complex 1 and Complex 2, respectively, at an applied potential of 0.45 V. Small values of Rct and Rs for Complex 1 indicate fast movements of ions and electrons during the electrochemical measurements.[37]

Further, the durability of Complex 1 was examined by conducting a cyclic stability test employing a higher scan rate of 100 mV s<sup>1</sup> for 500 cycles in an alkaline solution. Figure 4d illustrates the cycling study of Complex 1, which suggests a slight increase in overpotential from 220 to 290 mV at 10 mA cm<sup>2</sup> current density. This small increase in overpotential after cyclic study reveals that the electrocatalyst is stable and long-lasting. To access the long-time stability of Complex 1, chronopotentiometry was employed by applying a constant current density of 10 mA cm<sup>2</sup> in 1 M KOH electrolyte. Figure 4e represents the chronopotentiometry results of Complex 1, showing that there is a negligible change in activity even after 100 h, showcasing the remarkable durability of the electrocatalyst. Furthermore, we have performed the stability test of Complex 2 in 1 M KOH for up to 20 h (Figure S12a, Supporting Information).

Moreover, the durability of Complex 1 was further evaluated with the help of multistep chronopotentiometry analysis at fixed intervals of 1200 s. This analysis encompassed a current density range spanning 10–160 mA cm<sup>2</sup> . The potential of Complex 1 remains constant for up to 1200 s at different applied current densities (Figure 4f ). This analysis demonstrates the robust and durable nature of the electrocatalyst in various electrocatalytic applications.

The turnover frequency (TOF) is a kinetic parameter that indicates how fast the electrocatalysts can catalyze an electrochemical reaction at a defined overpotential. The TOF was calculated by using the cyclic voltammetry (CV) curve to determine the linear slope between the scan rate and oxidation peak, using Equation S(3) and S(4) (Figure S13, Supporting Information) at an overpotential of 320 mV. The calculated TOF values for Complex 1 and Complex 2 are 0.269 and 0.196 s<sup>1</sup> , respectively. The Complex 1 electrocatalyst exhibits a higher TOF value and electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) (Table S4, Supporting Information), as compared to Complex 2.

The exchange current density (J0) is a crucial criterion for assessing the effectiveness of electrocatalysts. Equation S(5) was used to calculate the J<sup>0</sup> for Complex 1 and Complex 2. Table S1, Supporting Information shows that the calculated J<sup>0</sup> value is higher for Complex 1 (0.98 mA cm<sup>2</sup> ) compared to Complex 2 (0.382 mA cm<sup>2</sup> ). The higher J<sup>0</sup> value for Complex 1 indicates faster kinetics of OER and more electrocatalytic active sites during the electrocatalytic measurements.

Additionally, before and after conducting electrochemical tests, we performed SEM study of the working electrode Complex 1. The deposition of Complex 1 and Complex 2 on CP is shown in Figure S14a,c, Supporting Information. The fiber of the bare CP is smooth (see the inset of Figure S14a, Supporting Information). In order to examine the stability of the material, we took SEM pictures of the working electrodes once more after doing a long-term stability investigation for 100 h. Figure S14b, Supporting Information shows that the electrocatalyst (Complex 1) does not leach out in the 1 M KOH electrolyte after 100 h of stability. The SEM pictures show that the catalyst is extremely robust and stable, which is advantageous for its practical applications. Similarly, Figure S14d, Supporting Information shows that the complex 2 is stable for up to 20 h in alkaline medium.

Figure S15a,c, Supporting Information displays the CV of Complex 1 and Complex 2 at different scan rates. These CV curves were utilized to calculate the ECSA of the material using Equation S(6). The calculated Cdl value for Complex 1 is 0.00319 mF cm<sup>2</sup> , and the ECSA is 0.079 cm<sup>2</sup> (Figure S15b, Supporting Information). For Complex 2, the calculated Cdl value is 0.00121 mF cm<sup>2</sup> , and the ECSA is 0.030 cm<sup>2</sup> (Figure S15d, Supporting Information).

The comprehensive results of the electrochemical analyses show that Complex 1 performs better than Complex 2 in terms of activity and efficiency for OER. Complex 1 has a lower overpotential, a lower Tafel slope, a lower Rct value, a higher TOF, and a larger electrochemically active surface area. These positive

The electrochemical reactions that occur on the surface of the electrode are a complex, multistep process. In general, the accepted OER reaction pathways comprise four successive proton and electron transfers. In OER, the following steps are involved in alkaline electrolytes.[38]

an alkaline electrolyte, the O2 evolution reaction at a metal center happens through the formation of M─OH and M─OOH intermediate.[4,19,39,40] The mechanistic pathway of OER catalyzed by nickel(II) complexes in an alkaline electrolyte is depicted in Scheme 2. [41]

## 3.3. Electrocatalytic Performance Toward UOR

In addition to OER, the electrocatalytic UOR is a highly significant combined process that synergistically achieves energy conversion and wastewater treatment. We were inspired by the excellent activity of the material in OER to evaluate the activity of Complex 1 and Complex 2 toward UOR in 1 M KOH and 0.5 M urea electrolyte. The electrocatalytic performance of bare CP, Complex 1, and Complex 2 was tested under identical conditions at room temperature. Figure 5a displays that bare CP has negligible activity for UOR, while Complex 1 reveals outstanding performance, achieving a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>2</sup> with a significantly lower overpotential of 1.30 V. However, to achieve the same current density, Complex 2 requires a higher overpotential of 1.41 V. These results confirm that the use of urea is efficient in reducing the oxidation potential. Furthermore, this performance is comparable to or even better than that of other recently developed UOR electrocatalysts (Table 3).

In addition, the corresponding Tafel plot by converting the LSV depicted in Figure 5b was obtained to investigate the UOR catalytic behavior and dynamic response of the prepared samples. The Tafel slope was calculated to be 40 mV dec<sup>1</sup> for Complex 1 and 71 mV dec<sup>1</sup> for Complex 2. Lowering the Tafel slope value of Complex 1 compared to Complex 2 validates its exceptional efficiency and accelerated UOR kinetics.

The EIS data were collected to analyze the charge transfer property of UOR on both NiII-based materials. Figure 5c presents the fitted Nyquist plot for Complex 1 and Complex 2 in an alkaline–urea electrolyte. The Nyquist plot indicates that when a potential of 0.3 V is applied, the Rct value for Complex 1 (1.11 Ω) is lower than that of Complex 2 (4.82 Ω) (Table S5, Supporting Information). This finding suggests that rapid charge transport occurs during the electrocatalytic UOR.

The stable behavior of nickel(II) complexes over a longer time was examined using chronopotentiometry analysis by maintaining a persistent current density of 10 mA cm<sup>2</sup> in an electrolyte solution containing 1 M KOH and 0.5 M urea. The chronopotentiometry results of Complex 1 (Figure 5d) indicate a negligible change in activity after 20 h, demonstrating good durability of the complex. Moreover, the stability test of Complex 2 is given in Figure S12b, Supporting Information in alkaline–urea electrolyte.

Furthermore, we carried out an SEM analysis of the working electrode Complex 1 and Complex 2 prior and after electrochemical testing. Figure S16a,c, Supporting Information depicts the growth of Complex 1 and Complex 2 on CP. As shown in the inset of Figure S16a, Supporting Information, the bare CP fiber is smooth. After conducting a 20 h stability test, we once again took SEM images of the functioning electrodes to assess the stability of

material. Figure S16b, Supporting Information demonstrates that the electrocatalyst (Complex 1) does not leach out in the electrolyte. Moreover, the SEM analysis of Complex 2 after stability is also given in Figure S16d, Supporting Information.

To rationalize the higher electrocatalytic activity of the electrodes (Complexes 1 and 2), the ECSAs were calculated utilizing the electrochemical double-layer capacitances (Cdl). The Cdl can be measured through CV and calculated using Equation S(6).[42] Figure S17a,c, Supporting Information presents the CV results of Complex 1 and Complex 2 at different scan rates (from 10 to 50 mV s<sup>1</sup> ). A Cdl value of 0.0172 mF cm<sup>2</sup> and an ECSA value of 0.43 cm2 for Complex 1 are derived from Figure S17b, Supporting Information. Similarly, for Complex 2, the calculated Cdl value (Figure S17d, Supporting Information) is 0.00351 mF cm<sup>2</sup> with an ECSA of 0.087 cm2 . Moreover, the ECSA of Complex 1 is larger, indicating that it has a greater number of electrocatalytically active sites exposed during electrochemical applications. The merge data of OER and UOR is given in S18.

The results obtained from electrochemical analyses show that Complex 1 performs more effectively and efficiently in UOR compared to Complex 2. The lower overpotential value, low Rct, and greater ECSA value are all beneficial for the efficient activity of the material, making it a promising candidate for energy conversion applications.

## 3.4. Plausible Urea Oxidation Reaction (UOR) Mechanism Under Alkaline–Urea Electrolyte

The oxidation of urea takes place on the surface of the anode. In a catalyst regeneration mechanism, urea is oxidized into gas products, namely, N2, CO2, and H2O, while the catalyst is regenerated.[43–45]

$$6Ni(OH)_2 + 6OH^- \rightarrow 6NiOOH + 6H_2O + 6e^-$$
 (6)

$$6NiOOH + CO(NH_2)_2 + H_2O \rightarrow N_2 + CO_2 + 6Ni(OH)_2$$
 (7)

During the UOR, OH coordinates with the NiII center, forming Ni─OH. In an alkaline environment, Ni─OH undergoes oxidation to its active state, NiOOH (nickel oxyhydroxide), under a certain applied potential. The active NiOOH surface then facilitates the adsorption of urea molecules through the establishment of O─C and Ni─O coordination, which is driven by electrostatic interaction.[46] Consequently, urea undergoes oxidation, leading to the reduction of NiOOH to Ni─OH, thereby completing the catalytic cycle. The resulting Ni─OH then reacts with OH to repeat the cycle.[47,48]

# 4. Conclusion

In summary, this study described two mononuclear NiII-based complexes with similar N2O donor ligands. These complexes were characterized using various standard methods. SCXRD analysis disclosed that Complex 1 and Complex 2 crystallized in triclinic (space group P1 (2)) and monoclinic (space group P 21/c (14)) crystal systems. Both of these NiII complexes showed distorted octahedral geometry and were stable at room temperature. The detailed electrochemical investigations showed that these bifunctional electrocatalysts (Complexes 1 and 2) were sustainable and efficient for OER and UOR in alkaline solutions. The outstanding performance of Complex 1 in the OER required a small overpotential of 220 mV, while for the UOR, an overpotential of 1.30 V was needed to attain a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>2</sup> . Complex 1 remained highly stable up to 100 and 20 h at a constant current density of 10 mA cm<sup>2</sup> in 1 M KOH and alkaline urea electrolyte, respectively. Moreover Complex 2 is also stable up to 20 h in both the electrolytes. ECSA of Complex 1 (0.079 cm2 in OER, and 0.43 cm2 in UOR) is higher than Complex 2 (0.030 cm2 in OER, and 0.087 cm<sup>2</sup> in UOR) revealed by the CV study. These findings suggest that the electrocatalyst exhibits a greater abundance of active sites. The use of Schiff base containing catalysts in energy-efficient water oxidation electrocatalysis presents a new approach to designing affordable and efficient materials for future energy prospects.

# Synthesis of Nickel(II) Complexes: Synthesis of $[C_{26}H_{38}NiN_4O_4]$ (Complex 1)

Method A: A dried round bottom flask (RBF) containing nickel chloride hexahydrate (118.5 mg, 0.5 mmol) dissolved in methanol (8 mL); after that, a solution of O-vanillin (152 mg, 1 mmol) separately dissolved in methanol (8 mL) which was added to the prepared metal solution at room temperature with constant stirring. After 30 min of stirring, the amine base, 3-(dimethylamino)-1-propylamine (126 µL, 1 mmol), was added to the prepared reaction mixture. Subsequently, the reaction mixture was stirred for an additional 3 h at room temperature until a solution displaying a clear green coloration was observed. At the end, the green-colored solution was filtered, and the obtained filtrate was placed at rest. In 10 days, we got a good yield of high-quality rhombus-shaped reddish brown single crystals. After that, the crystals of Complex 1 (same crystallographic structure but a different synthetic process reported by Lin's group in 2008)<sup>[49]</sup> were separated by filtration and washed with diethyl ether (DEE) (two to four times) before drying under vacuum. Yield: 192 mg, 72% (based on nickel). Anal. Calcd for [C<sub>26</sub>H<sub>38</sub>NiN<sub>4</sub>O<sub>4</sub>]: C, 59.00; H, 7.24; N, 10.58%. Found: C, 59.05; H, 7.20; N, 10.58%. Selected FTIR data in cm<sup>-1</sup>: 445 (m), 490 (m), 615 (m), 729 (s), 856 (m), 1033 (m), 1218 (s), 1340 (m), 1440 (s), 1617 (s), 2340 (b), 2902 (b), [s = strong, m = medium, b = broad]. (For more details see Figure S9a, Supporting Information).

**Method B:** O-vanillin was dissolved in 2 mL of methanol within a 10 mL single-neck RBF. Subsequently, under nitrogen atmosphere and at room temperature, 3-(dimethylamino)-1-propylamine was added dropwise to the solution. After stirring the reaction mixture at room temperature for 1 h, solid nickel chloride hexahydrate was introduced to the mixture in an open atmosphere. Within 15 min, a yellow precipitate formed. The resulting reaction mixture was stirred for an additional hour to encourage further precipitation. The yellow precipitate was filtered, rinsed with methanol (many times), dried in high vacuum, and recrystallized in (chloroform: acetonitrile) (1:1) solvent mixture to obtain reddish brown crystals in a few days.

## Synthesis of [C<sub>24</sub>H<sub>32</sub>NiF<sub>2</sub>N<sub>4</sub>O<sub>2</sub>] (Complex 2)

The development of a single crystal of Complex 2 followed a similar procedure, except for the substitution of 5-fluorosalicylaldehyde (140 mg, 1 mmol) for 2-hydroxy-3-methoxy benzaldehyde, while keeping all other conditions constant. In a week, high-quality rhombus-shaped reddish brown single crystals were obtained in high yield from slow evaporation. The crystals underwent filtration and were subsequently rinsed with DEE (two to four times) before drying under vacuum. Yield: 170 mg, 67% (based on nickel). Anal. Calcd for [ $C_{24}H_{32}NiF_2N_4O_2$ ]: C, 57.06; H, 6.38; N, 11.09%. Found: C, 57.01; H, 6.42; N, 11.05%. Selected FTIR data in cm<sup>-1</sup>: 462 (m), 558 (m), 665 (b), 793 (s), 813 (m), 1038 (b), 1130 (m), 1233 (b), 1383 (m), 1464 (s), 1532 (b), 1624 (s), 2340 (b), 2972 (b), [s = strong, m = medium, b = broad]. (For more details see Figure S9b, Supporting Information).

### **Characterization Techniques**

The UV-visible absorbance measurements were carried out on a UV-vis spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-1800) across a scanning range of 190–900 nm with a resolution of 2.0. Solid-state FTIR

measurements were performed on a Bruker Tensor-27 FTIR spectrophotometer over a scanning range of 4000–400 cm<sup>-1</sup> at a resolution of 4.0. ZEISS EVO 18 special edition instrument was used to take the SEM images of the synthesized complexes. Elemental analysis and single-crystal XRD were performed for the confirmation of ligand binding toward metal complexes using Thermo Scientific Flash 2000 (formerly the flash EA1112) elemental analyzer and Bruker D8 venture diffractometer system, respectively.

#### Crystallographic Data Collection and Refinement

Suitable single crystals of Complex 1 (crystal size  $0.04 \times 0.03 \times 0.02$ mm) and Complex 2 (crystal size  $0.02 \times 0.02 \times 0.01$  mm) were mounted for manipulation and selection after being moved from mother liquor to paraton oil. One of these crystals was put on a nylon loop that was attached to the goniometer-D8 Venure head and gradually chilled with a cold stream of nitrogen gas to 100 K. The first crystal inspection and data collection were carried out using the software APEX2.[50] The Bruker APEX II diffractometer utilized a sealedtube monochromated emitting MoKa radiation at a wavelength of 0.71073 and was equipped with a charge-coupled device (CCD) detector (PHOTON). Both complexes had intensity measurements and unit cell measurements performed at 296 K. The structure of the complexes was solved using SHELXT for both Complex 1 and Complex 2.[51] The absorption adjustment was performed using the program SADABS, and crystal structure refinement of both complexes was done with the SHELXL<sup>[50]</sup> refinement package by putting into use least squares minimization. Every nonhydrogen particle was refined using an anisotropic thermal parameter. The hydrogen carbon atoms were placed into precise geometric places and given warm parameters 1 and 2 that matched the molecule to which they were connected. An initial search indicated that both Complex 1 and Complex 2 were crystallized in triclinic with space group  $\overline{P}1$  (2) and monoclinic with space group P21/c (14), respectively.

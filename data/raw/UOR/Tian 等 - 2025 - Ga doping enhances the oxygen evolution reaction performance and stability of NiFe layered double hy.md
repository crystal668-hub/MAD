Ga doping enhances the oxygen evolution reaction

performance and stability of NiFe layered double

NiFe layered double hydroxide (NiFe-LDH), as a promising non-precious metal oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst, suffers from the inherent limitations of poor conductivity and insufficient exposure of active sites, coupled with the phenomenon of activity decline at high current densities, which severely restricts its application in the OER. Here, we propose a structurally defective strategy to prepare a self-assembled ultrathin nanosheet structure by introducing Ga<sup>3+</sup> ions, and *in situ* growth of NiFeGa-LDH@NF on nickel foam (NF) to improve its OER performance. The incorporation of Ga<sup>3+</sup> reduces the average thickness of the nanosheets from 4–5 nm to 1–2 nm, which significantly increases the catalyst activity surface area, and further optimizes its electronic structure causing a significant decrease in the charge transfer resistance. The optimized NiFeGa-LDH@NF provides a high current density of 100 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> at an overpotential of 258 mV, which is 43 mV lower than that of the pure NiFe-LDH@NF. Moreover, the voltage changes by only 1.3% after 72 h at a constant current density of 50 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, showing its excellent stability. This work presents a new perspective to increase structural defects by the introduction of transition metal ions and demonstrates the effect on OER performance, providing a new line of thought for the development of higher performance OER electrocatalysts.

## 1. Introduction

With the continuous growth of global energy demand, many countries and regions are facing energy shortages.1 Green, efficient, and renewable energy systems have received a great deal of attention from researchers,2 and the electrolyzed water system provides a solution for storing zero-carbon and nonpolluting energy sources such as light, wind, and tidal energy.3,4 The production of hydrogen via electrolysis of water represents a more efficient and environmentally benign approach compared to traditional industrial methods such as steam reforming of hydrocarbons. 5-7 However, the slow reaction kinetics of the OER due to the fact that it involves more protoncoupled electron transfers than the HER results in the need for higher overpotentials to overcome the reaction energy barriers.<sup>8,9</sup> Unfortunately, the existing noble metal catalysts such as IrO2 and RuO2 are limited by the scarcity of resources and high cost for large-scale commercial applications. 10,11 Therefore, the development of efficient and cost-effective nonprecious metal catalysts is urgently needed. 12,13

See DOI:  NiFe-LDHs with a unique layered structure and special electron distribution have emerged as promising OER electrocatalysts under alkaline conditions. However, the limited number of active sites, poor conductivity, and tendency to stack and aggregate affect the exposure of active sites and electron transfer process, which greatly limits their OER activity. In order to solve these problems, several schemes have been proposed and demonstrated so that they can achieve better performance in the OER process.

On the one hand, a reliable strategy is the construction of multilevel structured nanosheets by a hydrothermal method. 18,19 For example, Zhang *et al.* coupled ultrathin NiFe LDH with NiCoP nanowires *via* a three-step hydrothermal-phosphorylation-hydrothermal process, and successfully prepared 3D hierarchical heterostructured NiFe LDH@NiCoP/NF electrodes on nickel foam through special interfacial engineering and synergistic interactions. A voltage of only 1.57 V is required to reach 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> when used as the cathode and anode for overall water decomposition. 20 Wang *et al.* designed an edge-enriched (EE) NiFe-LDH nanoarray with abundant coordination unsaturated sites using metal-organic skeleton (MOF) nanosheet arrays as a structure-guided template. 21

On the other hand, the synergistic effect of doping polymetallic ions has attracted extensive research interest due to their high activity.<sup>22</sup> Sun *et al.* fabricated and synthesized

ultrathin rhodium-doped NiFe-layered double hydroxide nanosheets using a glycol-assisted *in situ* growth strategy. The prepared NiFeRh-LDH catalysts exhibited excellent HER and OER activities compared to the pristine NiFe-LDH.<sup>23</sup> Liao *et al.* doped Ce<sup>3+</sup> ions into the lattice of NiFe-layered double hydroxides grown *in situ* on carbon paper, and successfully prepared NiFe-LDH@CP catalysts enriched with structurally perturbed and significantly distorted lattices and defects, which exhibited excellent OER activity.<sup>24</sup>

Here, we successfully prepared NiFeGa-LDH ultrathin nanosheet structures on NF by a simple one-step hydrothermal method utilizing the blocking property possessed by the fluoride ions in ammonium fluoride. The vertically dispersed and uniformly distributed ultrathin nanosheets strongly improved the electronic charge transfer and provided a larger electrochemical specific surface area. The optimised NiFeGa-LDH has a good OER electroactivity with an overpotential of 258 mV at 100 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. At a high current density of 50 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, only a slight decay occurs after 72 h with good stability.

## 2. Experimental section

## 2.1. NiFeGa-LDH@NF preparation

Ferric nitrate nonahydrate (Fe(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>·9H<sub>2</sub>O, AR), potassium hydroxide (KOH, AR), ethanol, and acetone were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Nickel nitrate hexahydrate (Ni(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>·6H<sub>2</sub>O, AR) and gallium nitrate hydrate (Ga(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>·xH<sub>2</sub>O, AR) were purchased from Aladdin Reagent. Urea (CO(NH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, AR) and ammonium fluoride (NH<sub>4</sub>F, AR, 98%) were purchased from Shanghai Macklin Biochemical Co. NF was purchased from SCI Materials Hub (99.9%, bore diameter 200–250  $\mu$ m, thickness 0.3 mm). All the chemical reagents were of analytical grade and could be used without further purification. The experiments were carried out with deionized water.

First, in order to remove surface impurities, the NF (1  $\times$  2 cm<sup>2</sup>) was pretreated by sequential ultrasonication using acetone, anhydrous ethanol, deionized water and 3 M HCl for 15 min, respectively, and dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C. After that, 1.2 mmol of  $Ni(NO_3)_2 \cdot 6H_2O$ , 0.6 mmol of  $Fe(NO_3)_3 \cdot 9H_2O$ , 0.09 mmol of  $Ga(NO_3)_3 \cdot xH_2O$  and 6.5 mmol of urea were dissolved in 45 mL of ultrapure water under continuous stirring for 15 min, and then the precursor solution with the acid-washed nickel foam was transferred to a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) reactor and 1 mmol of NH<sub>4</sub>F was added. The reactor was heated in an oven at 120 °C for 9 h. After cooling, it was washed several times with ultrapure water and ethanol to remove the residues. Finally, it was dried under vacuum for 12 h. The mass of the catalyst loaded was obtained by weighing the difference in the mass of the foamed nickel before and after the hydrothermal treatment, which was about 2.5-3 mg. The product was named NiFeGa-LDH@NF. For the sake of comparison, NiFeGa-LDH@NF with different Ga3+ ion doping ratios and NiFe-LDH@NF without the Ga<sup>3+</sup> ion precursor were prepared in the same way by varying only the added  $Ga(NO_3)_3 \cdot xH_2O$  content. The products were named NiFe-LDH@NF, NiFeGa<sub>0.08</sub>-LDH@NF, NiFeGa<sub>0.1</sub>-LDH@NF and NiFeGa<sub>0.12</sub>-LDH@NF.

The RuO<sub>2</sub> catalyst was prepared according to the literature by dispersion. 3 mg of RuO<sub>2</sub> was dropped onto NF (1  $\times$  1 cm<sup>2</sup>) and the product was named RuO<sub>2</sub>@NF.

#### 2.2. Material characterization

The surface microstructure of NiFeGa-LDH@NF was characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Quanta 600F) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, FEI Talos F200x), and the crystalline phases and chemical composition of the samples were investigated using X-ray diffraction (XRD, D8 ADVANCE, Bruker) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo Scientific K-Alpha,  $h\nu=1486.6$  eV).

### 2.3. Electrochemical measurements

The electrochemical tests were performed on a CHI 760E electrochemical workstation (Shanghai Chenhua). The electrochemical tests were performed using a conventional three-electrode battery system for cyclic voltammetry (CV), linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements, where NiFeGa-LDH@NF, mercury/mercury oxide electrode (Hg/HgO), and Pt foil were used as the working, reference and counter electrodes, respectively, and 1 M KOH (pH = 14) was used as the electrolyte. The area of the working electrode in contact with the electrolyte was strictly controlled to be 1  $\times$  1 cm². The experiments were carried out at room temperature and in an air atmosphere.

LSV curves were recorded using a scan rate of 5 mV s<sup>-1</sup> and IR compensation of 90%. EIS curves were obtained at a constant potential of 0.6 V ( $\nu s$ . Hg/HgO) and over a frequency range of 0.01 Hz to 100 kHz. Stability tests were performed by constant current chronopotentiometry at constant current densities of 50 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, 100 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, and 200 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> for long periods of time. The conversion of the RHE based on the simplified theoretical Nernst equation leads to errors in assessing the electrocatalytic activity<sup>25</sup> (Fig. S1 $\dagger$ ). Electrochemical surface area (ECSA), potential shift, overpotential and turnover frequency were calculated using eqn (1)–(4), respectively:

$$ECSA = C_{dl}/C_{s} \tag{1}$$

$$E \text{ (vs. RHE)} = E \text{ (vs. Hg/HgO)} + 0.931$$
 (2)

$$\eta = E \text{ (vs. RHE)} - 1.23 \text{ V}$$
 (3)

$$TOF = j \times N_A / (n \times F \times \Gamma)$$
 (4)

where  $C_{\rm s}$  represents the capacitance of the electrode (F cm<sup>-2</sup>),  $C_{\rm dl}$  represents the capacitance of the double layer electrode (F cm<sup>-2</sup>), j represents the current density (mA cm<sup>-2</sup>),  $N_{\rm A}$  is Avogadro's constant (6.023  $\times$  10<sup>23</sup> mol<sup>-1</sup>), n is the number of electrons required to produce one  $O_{\rm 2}$  molecule (in the OER reaction, n=4), F is Faraday's constant (96 485.3 C mol<sup>-1</sup>), and  $\Gamma$  is the surface concentration or the exact number of active sites catalyzing the reaction.

#### Results and discussion 3.

The XRD patterns of the prepared samples are shown in Fig. 1a. The four typical characteristic peaks at 11.4°, 22.97°, 34.4°, and 38.99° can be attributed to the (003), (006), (012) and (015) planes of NiFe-LDH (PDF # 40-0215), respectively. In addition. the diffraction peaks at 44.5°, 51.8°, and 76.4° can be attributed to the (111), (200) and (220) planes of the NF (PDF # 04-0850) substrate.26 The diffraction peaks of NiFeGa<sub>0.08</sub>-LDH@NF (12.1°), NiFeGa<sub>0.1</sub>-LDH@NF (11.9°) and NiFeGa<sub>0.12</sub>-LDH@NF (11.8°) are shifted compared to the 11.4° peak corresponding to the (003) plane of NiFe-LDH@NF, confirming that the Ga<sup>3+</sup> ion was successfully doped into NiFe-LDH and did not change its layered structure.

The presence of Ni, Fe, and Ga elements in NiFeGa-LDH was confirmed based on XPS spectra, and the chemical valence changes of the samples were further analyzed to understand the effect of Ga<sup>3+</sup> ion introduction on the charge distribution in NiFe-LDH. As shown in Fig. 1b, the Ni 2p XPS spectrum reveals that the peaks located at 859.1 eV and 877.1 eV belong to Ni<sup>3+</sup> and the peaks located at 855.9 eV and 874.2 eV belong to Ni<sup>2+</sup>. The Ni 2p<sub>3/2</sub> peaks in NiFeGa<sub>0.1</sub>-LDH are blueshifted with respect to NiFe-LDH, shifting to a higher electronic energy level by 0.7 eV. It can be seen that the percentage of Ni<sup>3+</sup> in NiFeGa<sub>0.1</sub>-LDH has increased, indicating that Ga<sup>3+</sup> ion doping has altered the electrical density of the Ni ion and improved the high valence state of the Ni ion, resulting in more Ni<sup>3+</sup> sites with higher activity.<sup>27</sup> As shown in Fig. 1c, in the Fe 2p spectra of NiFeGa<sub>0.1</sub>-LDH, NiFe-LDH, two broad peaks appeared at 712.05 eV and 722.33 eV, which are related to Fe 2p<sub>3/2</sub> and Fe

2p<sub>1/2</sub> respectively, indicating the presence of Fe<sup>3+</sup>. As shown in Fig. 1d, the peaks of Ga  $2p_{3/2}$  and Ga  $2p_{1/2}$  are located at 1121.05 eV and 1147.73 eV, respectively, which are derived from Ga<sup>3+</sup> in GaOOH.<sup>28</sup> It is noteworthy that after the introduction of Ga<sup>3+</sup> into NiFe-LDH, the two peaks of Fe<sup>3+</sup> show a redshift phenomenon to the lower electron energy level by 0.7 eV, which seems to indicate the existence of synergistic electronic interactions among Ni, Fe and Ga cations.

The schematic of the synthesis of NiFeGa-LDH@NF is shown in Fig. 2a, as an ultrathin nanosheet/flower structure grown in situ on nickel foam by a self-assembly process using Ni(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>- $6H_2O$ ,  $Fe(NO_3)_3-9H_2O$ ,  $Ga(NO_3)_3-xH_2O$ , urea and  $NH_4F$  as precursors. Fig. 2b and c show SEM images at different scales, which show that NiFeGa-LDH is uniformly distributed on the NF substrate. Surprisingly, the thickness and size of the nanosheet structures revealed at a scale of 500 nm appear significantly thinner compared to NiFe-LDH (Fig. 2d). The EDSmapping data in Fig. 2e analyze the surface, and the four elements Ni, Fe, Ga, and O are likewise distributed in a very homogeneous state in the nanosheet structure. These results confirm that the Ga element was successfully and uniformly doped into the NiFe-LDH material without agglomeration.

The nanosheet morphology of NiFeGa-LDH was further revealed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images (Fig. 3a), and was in line with the SEM images discussed above. Both NiFeGa-LDH and NiFe-LDH exhibit vertically aligned interconnected 3D nanosheet structures. In addition, analysis of the HRTEM images in Fig. 3b and d indicates that the images show clear long-range ordered lattice fringes. The surface of the EDS-mapping data analyzed in Fig. 3e shows that the

distribution of the four elements, Ni, Fe, Ga, and O, in the ultrathin nanosheet structure is also very uniform, which coincides with the SEM data. Surprisingly, in comparison with the nanosheets composed of NiFeLDH (Fig. 3c), the average thickness of individual nanosheets of NiFeGa-LDH decreased from 4-5 nm to 1-2 nm (Fig. 3a). And this ultra-thin nanosheet structure can significantly increase the active surface area of the catalyst, thus providing more active sites. Benefitting from this, the charge transfer path can be reduced and the interstructural charge transfer efficiency can be improved, which further reduces the electrochemical impedance and helps to improve the intrinsic activity and reaction rate of the catalyst. Meanwhile, the lattice stripe spacings shown in the HRTEM images in Fig. 3b and d are 0.214 nm and 0.197 nm, respectively, which

are attributed to the d spacing of the (018) plane of NiFe-LDH. As expected, the doping of Ga<sup>3+</sup> increased the *d*-spacing of the (018) plane by 0.017 nm, which might be attributed to the lattice distortion caused by the ionic radius of Ga<sup>3+</sup> (62 pm) being larger than that of Fe<sup>3+</sup> (55 pm). In addition, the introduction of Ga<sup>3+</sup> may change the lattice parameters and produce a series of crystal defects such as lattice distortions and dislocations, which is reflected in the fast Fourier transform (FFT) analysis plots in the insets of Fig. 3b and d. The disorder of the lattice indicates that the introduction of Ga<sup>3+</sup> has changed the crystal structure of the original subject. These defects can be used as active sites to further enhance the electrocatalytic performance of the catalyst.

In order to explore the effect of Ga<sup>3+</sup> doping on OER activity, linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) measurements were carried out by using 1 M KOH with a typical three-electrode system and compared with a commercial benchmark RuO2 catalyst. As shown in Fig. 4a, the overpotentials at 10 and 100 mA cm $^{-2}$  were significantly reduced at different levels of Ga<sup>3+</sup> doping ratios. At the optimized Ga3+ doping level of 0.09 mmol, NiFeGa0.1-LDH@NF achieved current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> with minimum overpotentials of 224 and 258 mV, respectively, which were much lower than those of NiFe-LDH@NF (251 and 338 mV), RuO<sub>2</sub>@NF (375 and 446 mV) and NF (377 and 495 mV) (Fig. 4b). In addition, data that have not been IR corrected are placed in the ESI for the reader's reference (Fig. S2†). Importantly, NiFeGa<sub>0.1</sub>-LDH@NF also showed a clear superiority in OER activity compared to other catalysts reported so far, validating the key role of Ga atoms in improving the OER performance of NiFe-LDH@NF. Moreover, NiFeGa<sub>0.1</sub>-LDH@NF only needs an overpotential of 271 mV to reach a high current density of 200 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, which makes it valuable for high current density applications. In addition, Tafel plots confirmed the fast reaction kinetics of the OER. As shown in Fig. 4c, among NiFe-LDH@NF (90.6 mV  $dec^{-1}$ ), RuO<sub>2</sub>@NF (57.5 mV  $dec^{-1}$ ) and other corresponding catalysts, NiFeGa<sub>0.1</sub>-LDH@NF has the smallest Tafel slope of 35.4 mV dec-1, indicating that the reaction kinetics were significantly enhanced by the introduction of Ga<sup>3+</sup>. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used to investigate the charge transfer capability at the electrocatalyst interface. NiFeGa<sub>0.1</sub>-LDH@NF exhibits the smallest curve radius, corresponding to the lowest charge transfer resistance of 0.38  $\Omega$ , which matches very well with its lowest Tafel slope, and also corresponds to the above analysis of the thickness of the nanosheets in the SEM image.

Fig. 4e shows the Bode plot corresponding to the Nyquist plot, where a decreasing trend in peak frequency from NiFe-LDH@NF (1.212 Hz) to NiFeGa<sub>0.1</sub>-LDH@NF (0.316 Hz) is observed, which suggests that the electrons exhibit longer lifetimes in the catalysts, and the peak frequency in the Bode plot can be used to compute the lifetime of the electrons  $\tau$ , which is calculated by applying the equation  $\tau = 1/(2\pi f(peak))$ . This shows an enhancement of the electron lifetime from 131 ms before doping to 505 ms, which may be attributed to the optimal electron filling state created by the doped Ga3+ into NiFe-LDH@NF, and likewise suggests a great enhancement in the rate of charge transfer between the catalytic site and the oxygen-containing adsorbate.29 Moreover, the Cdl values obtained from CV in Fig. 4f reveal the intrinsic OER activity of the electrocatalysts.  $^{30,31}$  The  $C_{\rm dl}$  of NiFeGa-LDH@NF is 34.1 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>, which is significantly larger than that of the other control samples, indicating that NiFeGa-LDH@NF has a larger ECSA, the presence of more active sites.32

The TOF (turnover frequency) of NiFeGa<sub>0.1</sub>-LDH@NF was acquired by calculating the intrinsic activity of NiFeGa<sub>0.1</sub>-LDH@NF *versus* NiFe-LDH@NF as OER catalysts, and the number of active sites was determined from the area under the oxidation peak of the CV curve. As shown in Fig. 5a, the introduction of Ga<sup>3+</sup> enabled NiFeGa<sub>0.1</sub>-LDH@NF to have higher TOF values at different overpotentials compared to NiFe-LDH@NF, and NiFeGa<sub>0.1</sub>-LDH@NF was able to catalyze the reaction more efficiently as an OER catalyst under the same conditions.<sup>30,33</sup> In order to investigate the long-term operational

stability of NiFeGa<sub>0.1</sub>-LDH@NF catalysts, constant current chronopotentiometry (CP) was performed at high current densities of 50 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, 100 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> and 200 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. It was found that the OER process causes dramatic bubbling on the surface of NiFeGa<sub>0.1</sub>-LDH@NF. The NiFeGa<sub>0.1</sub>-LDH@NF electrode has an amazing stability retention rate, which allows it to retain the OER electrocatalytic activity without significant decay after 72 h (Fig. 5b), and the voltage change at the end of the test was only elevated by 1.3% of the pre-test voltage. This is supported by the LSV curves before and after the stability test (Fig. 5c). Meanwhile, the comparison of the XPS orbital peak plots of Ga 3d before and after the test shows the retention of the Ga element after a long period of testing (Fig. S3†), which is a remarkable piece of evidence of improved stability. Impressively, it also worked continuously for 24 h at high current densities of 100 and 200 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> with only 0.2-0.3% voltage increase (Fig. 5d), which could be attributed to NiFeGa<sub>0.1</sub>-LDH@NF's unique vertically grown nanosheets as well as the 3D structured stacked nanoflowers formed by the threedimensional structure, which facilitate the rapid release of bubbles at high current densities.

As can be seen from the above analysis, the introduction of gallium contributes significantly to the enhancement of both the electrocatalytic activity and OER stability of NiFe-LDH. Compared with the doping of other transition metal ions (Table S1†), the introduction of Ga<sup>3+</sup> makes the stability enhancement of NiFe-LDH at high current densities to be significant and have good catalytic activity. We believe that this is a unique advantage that Ga has. The reason for this can be understood as the following. Primarily, the introduction of gallium induces lattice distortion and significantly optimizes the thickness of NiFe-LDH to form an ultrathin nanosheet structure with more surface defects (Fig. 6a and b). Benefitting from this, its charge transfer capability is greatly enhanced while more active sites are exposed on the surface, and which consequently leads to a lower overpotential and higher OER stability of NiFeGa-LDH.

#### 4. Conclusions

In this work, NiFe layered double hydroxides of Ga-doped NiFe grown in situ on nickel foam for use in the electrocatalytic OER were successfully prepared as highly catalytically active NiFeGa-LDH@NF catalysts with significantly distorted lattice defects. Thanks to the ultrathin 3D nanosheet structure with lattice defects, the optimal NiFeGa<sub>0.1</sub>-LDH@NF exhibits excellent OER activity, requiring only 258 mV overpotential at 100 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, which is 80 mV lower than that of the pure NiFe-LDH@NF, and is in a better position than its counterparts. It also exhibits relatively good long-term stability over 72 h. A series of characterization studies indicate that the lattice distortion and morphology modulation strategy induced by doped transition metal ions is an effective and feasible strategy to enhance the OER catalytic activity of NiFe-LDH. This study provides a promising strategy for the construction of defect-rich and efficient OER electrocatalysts.

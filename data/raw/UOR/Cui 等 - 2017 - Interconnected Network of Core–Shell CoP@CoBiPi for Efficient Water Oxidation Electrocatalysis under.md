Developing earth-abundant electrocatalysts for efficient and stable water oxidation under near neutral conditions is of great importance but still remains a key challenge. Herein, we demonstrate the development of an interconnected network of core–shell CoP@CoBiPi through anodic polarization of a CoP nanoarray in potassium borate aqueous electrolyte (KBi). This 3D CoP@CoBiPi exhibits high catalytic activity for water oxidation at pH 9.2 and needs an overpotential (h) of only 410 mV to drive a geometrical catalytic current density of 10 mAcm@<sup>2</sup> , with a high turnover frequency of 819 h @1 at an overpotential of 610 mV. Remarkably, this catalyst also demonstrates high long-term electrochemical stability with its activity being maintained for at least 27 h in KBi. This study provides us an attractive earth-abundant 3D catalyst electrode for water-splitting devices toward efficient and stable water oxidation under benign conditions.

Global energy crisis and environmental concerns caused by increased consumption of fossil fuels have sparked tremendous research attention in exploring alternative energy-storage and conversion systems.[1,2] Hydrogen is a clean, economical, and sustainable fuel and has been considered as such an ideal candidate.[3,4] Water splitting is a promising way to produce pure hydrogen.[5] However, a key step in the electrocatalytic watersplitting process is the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which

is kinetically sluggish and requires a minimum potential of 1.23 V (vs. reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE).[6–8] Effective OER electrocatalysts are necessary to attain high current densities at low overpotential (h).[9–11] Noble and non-noble metal oxides have been optimized as efficient OER catalysts,[12–17] but these systems typically utilize costly materials and/or operate under extreme conditions (pH<1 or pH >14), limiting the types of electrodes and cell components that can be used and preventing their widespread use.[18–21] Therefore, the development of inexpensive and efficient OER catalytic systems that operate under simple conditions is highly desirable.

Co-based compounds are an important class of materials with wide applications for water oxidation electrocatalysis under benign conditions.[22–30] Among them, Co phosphate (CoPi) and Co borate (CoBi) are of particular interest as they exhibit high activity in neutral or near neutral electrolyte. Moreover, they can self-heal by reversing catalyst corrosion at open circuit potential upon re-application of an anodic potential.[22,30,31] Such catalysts were usually electrodeposited on planar electrodes as films from Co<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> ions in aqueous potassium phosphate (KPi) or potassium borate (KBi) solutions.[22–34] From a point view of material preparation, it is also highly desired but still a key challenge to develop such Co-based OER catalysts with new strategies for highly efficient and stable water oxidation under near neutral conditions.

Herein, we demonstrate the construction of CoP@CoBiPi on a Ti-mesh current collector (CoP@CoBiPi/Ti) by anodic polarization of a CoP nanoarray (CoP NA/Ti) in 0.1m KBi (pH 9.2). In contrast to Nocera's work,[33] CoP was used as both Co and P sources and the resulting CoP@CoBiPi/Ti has an interconnected network with a core–shell structure. As a 3D catalyst electrode, CoP@CoBiPi/Ti was highly active for water oxidation and required overpotentials of only 370 and 410 mV to deliver geometrical current densities of 5 and 10 mAcm@<sup>2</sup> , respectively. In addition, a high turnover frequency (TOF) of 819 h @1 at an overpotential of 610 mV was achieved. Notably, this 3D catalyst also demonstrated high long-term electrochemical stability with its activity being maintained for at least 27 h.

Anodic polarization of CoP NA/Ti in borate aqueous electrolyte leads to increased current density, indicating the formation of more active sites (Figure S1 in the Supporting Information, see Experimental Section for preparation details). Figure 1 a shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of bare Ti mesh, CoP NA/Ti, and the resulting CoP@CoBiPi/Ti. The diffraction peaks at 31.6, 36.3, 36.7, 46.2, 48.1, and 56.78 can be indexed to the (011), (111), (102), (112), (211), and (301) planes of CoP, respectively (JCPDS No. 29-0497).[34] After anodic polarization,

the resulting material only shows decreased peak intensities characteristic of CoP, implying the formation of an amorphous phase on the CoP surface.[30] Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP–MS) analysis of the sample shows an atomic ratio of 1.01:1.20:0.46:7.32 for Co/B/P/O, similar to the energydispersive X-ray (EDX) results (Figure S2), suggesting the formation of a CoBiPi phase.[28,30] Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images demonstrate that the CoP nanoarray was converted into an interconnected 3D network structure with a rough surface (Figure 1 d, e). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis further reveals the successful conversion of CoP nanowires. Figure 1 f shows a single CoP nanowire (ca. 100 nm in diameter) with a smooth surface and a crystalline spot pattern (inset). TEM image for CoP@CoBiPi shows the formation of a new shell layer on the CoP surface (Figure 1 g) with increased diameter (ca. 140 nm). High-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images also confirms the core–shell nature of CoP@ CoBiPi consisting of crystalline CoP as core and amorphous CoBiPi as shell (Figure 1 h). Figure 1 i presents the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of CoP@CoBiPi. The spot pattern for the crystalline core phase can be clearly seen, but weak diffuse rings from the amorphous CoBiPi shell are also observed.[35]

Figure S3 shows the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) survey spectrum of CoP@CoBiPi, suggesting the presence of Co, B, P, and O elements. The binding energies (BEs) at 191.6 eV for B 1s (Figure 2 a), 133.4 eV for P 2p (Figure 2 b), and 530.8 eV for O 1s (Figure 2 c) reveal the formation of borate and phosphate depositions.[36,37] Figure 2d shows the XPS spectrum of Co 2p, and the 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 peaks at 780.5 and 795.5 eV are in a range typical of Co<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> or Co<sup>3</sup><sup>+</sup> bound to oxygen.[22,37] All these observations confirm that CoP is successfully converted into CoBiPi by anodic polarization. A possible formation mechanism of CoP@CoBiPi structure is briefly presented as follows: Co and P atoms at CoP surface are first oxidized into Co<sup>3</sup><sup>+</sup> and P 5+ which are then deposited in situ with borate and hydroxide, forming CoBi, CoPi, Co oxide, and Co oxyhydroxide, namely the CoBiPi phase. Such deposition process can proceed repeatedly until the CoP nanowire is fully covered with CoBiPi phase, finally leading to

an interconnected network of core–shell 3D CoP@ CoBiPi.[33]

The electrocatalytic OER performance of CoP@ CoBiPi/Ti (CoP@CoBiPi loading: 1.2 mgcm@<sup>2</sup> ) was tested in 0.1m KBi (pH 9.2) using a typical threeelectrode setup with a scan rate of 1 mV s@<sup>1</sup> . RuO<sup>2</sup> on Ti mesh (state-of-the-art catalyst, RuO<sup>2</sup> /Ti, RuO<sup>2</sup> loading: 1.2 mgcm@<sup>2</sup> ), CoP NA/Ti, and bare Ti mesh were also evaluated for comparison. As the as-measured reaction currents do not directly reflect the intrinsic behavior of catalysts owing to the effect of ohmic resistance, we applied an iR (uncompensated resistance correction to all original data for further analysis.[38] Figure 3 a shows the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves on the RHE scale. Bare Ti mesh shows no OER

activity. The activated precursor (cobalt hydroxide) requires an overpotential of 770 mV to reach 10 mAcm@<sup>2</sup> . CoP NA/Ti is active for OER electrocatalysis requiring an overpotential of 530 mV to approach 10 mA cm@<sup>2</sup> . In contrast, CoP@CoBiPi/Ti shows RuO<sup>2</sup> /Ti-like OER activity and only requires a lower overpotential of 410 mV to reach 10 mAcm@<sup>2</sup> . This overpotential compares favorably to the behavior of reported non-noble metal-borate OER catalysts in KBi electrolytes, including CoBi (h1 mA cm@<sup>2</sup> =390 mV),[28] NiBi (h1 mA cm@<sup>2</sup> =540 mV),[39] NiBi film (h1 mA cm@<sup>2</sup> =384 mV),[40] FeBi (h1 mA cm@<sup>2</sup> =490 mV),[41] and CuBi (h<sup>10</sup> mA cm@<sup>2</sup> =801 mV).[42] The required overpotential of CoP@Co-BiPi/Ti was also much lower than other reported non-noble-

metal OER catalysts in near neutral media (Table S1). Figure 3 b presents a plot of the current density as a function of overpotential (Tafel plots). RuO<sub>2</sub>/Ti had a Tafel slope of 215 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>. CoP@CoBiPi/Ti (159 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>) showed a decrease in the slope value compared to CoP NA/Ti (217 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>), which could be owed to the difference in catalytic structure, resistance of materials, and charge transfer on the surface. [43] Both the higher exchange current density and lower Tafel slope of CoP@CoBi-Pi/Ti suggest more favorable catalytic kinetics for OER than for CoP NA/Ti. Figure 3 c shows the cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of CoP@CoBiPi/Ti at different scan rates in the non-faradaic region (0.94-1.04 V) in KBi electrolyte. Figure 3 d presents the corresponding capacitive current at 0.99 V as a function of scan rate, giving a double-layer capacitance  $(C_{di})$  of 150 μF cm<sup>-2</sup>. This result is larger than that of the electrodeposited film catalyst  $(60-94 \mu F cm^{-2})$ , [44] reflecting a higher surface area/roughness and more catalytically active sites for CoP@Co-BiPi/Ti. Moreover, the large open spaces in the 3D interconnected network also facilitate the diffusion of the electrolyte and evolved oxygen gas. All the above-mentioned features contribute to the high activity of the catalyst.

The OER activity of a catalyst can also be expressed in terms of TOF, which is calculated as the number of  $O_2$  molecules formed per active site at a constant overpotential. We quantified the active sites from the oxidation peak in the LSV cure of CoP@CoBiPl/Ti and the integrated charge should be

proportional to the total number of active sites. Assuming a one-electron process for oxidation of Co center in CoBiPi, [^{24,25,48]} the upper limit of active sites was calculated to be 0.569  $\mu$ mol cm $^{-2}$ . TOF was determined to be 819 h $^{-1}$  for CoP@CoBiPi/Ti at an overpotential of 610 mV ( $j=50~{\rm mA\,cm}^{-2}$ ). This value compares favorably to the behavior of many other reported OER catalysts in near neutral medium, such as NiBi/ITO (36 h $^{-1}$ ,  $\eta=610~{\rm mV}$ , ITO: indium-doped tin oxide), [^{39]} FeBi/ITO (612 h $^{-1}$ ,  $\eta=600~{\rm mV}$ ), [^{41]} NiOx/FTO (39.6–54 h $^{-1}$ ,  $\eta=610~{\rm mV}$ , FTO: fluorine-doped tin oxide), [^{44]} and CoW/FTO (36 h $^{-1}$ ,  $\eta=640~{\rm mV}$ ). The high TOF of CoP@CoBiPi/Ti toward OER could be attributed to the combination of several factors including the enrichment of active Co $^{4+}$  ions on the surface, high conductivity of the CoP core, larger surface area, and facile diffusion of the reactants and products. [^{32,50-52]}

Stability is another critical factor that defines the performance of catalyst. We investigated the stability of CoP@ CoBiPi/Ti by CV scans between 1.1 and 1.5 V at an accelerated scan rate of 100 mV s<sup>-1</sup>. As shown in Figure 3 e, after continuous 1000 CV cycles, CoP@CoBiPi/Ti showed negligible decrease of current density. The long-term stability test by bulk electrolysis at a fixed overpotential of 480 mV ( $j = 20 \text{ mA cm}^{-2}$ ) indicates that this catalyst maintains its OER activity for at least 27 h, as shown in Figure 3 f. Further SEM analysis suggests that the CoP@CoBiPi/Ti also maintained its interconnected feature (Figure S5), confirming its long-term stability. Figure S4 shows a multi-step chronopotentiometric curve for CoP@CoBiPi/Ti with the current starting at 2 and increasing up to 36 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> (2 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> for the first step and 4 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> for others). The potential immediately leveled off at 1.69 V at the initial current value and remained unchanged for 500 s, indicating the outstanding conductivity, mass transport, and mechanical robustness of the electrode. [53] All these results reveal that CoP@ CoBiPi/Ti is a robust and efficient OER catalyst under near neutral conditions.

The Faradaic efficiency (FE) of CoP@CoBiPi/Ti was measured by gas chromatography (GC) analysis and measured quantitatively with the use of a calibrated pressure sensor to monitor the pressure change in an anode compartment of the H-type electrolytic cell. Figure 4 shows the amount of oxygen produced at 1.64 V in 0.1 M KBi. We can observe that the volume

of oxygen increases during continuous electrolysis, and nearly 30  $\mu$ mol of oxygen evolve after 30 min of electrolysis. The FE was calculated to be 96.2% by comparing the amount of experimentally quantified oxygen (dot) with the theoretically calculated oxygen (line).

In summary, anodic polarization proved as an effective strategy to convert a CoP nanoarray into an interconnected network of core—shell CoP@CoBiPi in borate solution. As a 3D electrode, CoP@CoBiPi/Ti showed superior OER catalytic activity in KBi electrolyte and required an overpotential of 410 mV to deliver a geometrical current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, with a high turnover frequency of 819 h<sup>-1</sup> at an overpotential of 610 mV. The catalyst also demonstrated good long-term electrochemical stability. This work not only offers us an attractive material for efficient and stable water oxidation electrocatalysis under near neutral conditions but would also open up new horizons for in situ electrochemical fabrication of 3D catalyst electrodes for applications.

# **Experimental Section**

#### Materials

Ti mesh was provided by Hangxu Filters Flag Store, Hengshui, P. R. China. NH<sub>4</sub>F, NaOH, and  $K_2B_4O_7\cdot 4H_2O$  were purchased from Beijing Chemical Corp.  $RuCl_3\cdot 3H_2O$ ,  $Co(NO_3)_2\cdot 6H_2O$ ,  $NaH_2PO_2$ , and urea were purchased from Aladdin Ltd. (Shanghai, P. R. China). Nafion (5 wt%) was purchased from Sigma–Aldrich. All reagents were used as received. The water used throughout all experiments was purified through a Millipore system.

### Preparation of CoP NA/Ti

A piece of Ti mesh  $(2\times3 \text{ cm})$  was carefully pretreated with concentrated HCl for 10 min to remove impurities of the surface, and then deionized water and ethanol were used several times to ensure the surface of the Ti mesh was well cleaned. After drying, the weight of each treated Ti mesh was recorded.

Synthesis of hydroxide precursor:  $Co(NO_3)_2 \cdot 6H_2O$  (3 mmol),  $NH_4F$  (8 mmol), and urea (15 mmol) were dissolved in deionized water (50 mL) to form a transparent pink solution by constant stirring. Then, the solution was transferred into a 50 mL polytetrafluoroethylene Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave. The pretreated Ti mesh was immersed in the solution, sealed and kept at 120 °C for 6 h.

**Synthesis of CoP Na/Ti**: the hydroxide precursor on Ti mesh and NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>2</sub> were put at two separate positions in a porcelain boat with NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>2</sub> (0.5 g) at the upstream side of a furnace. After flushing with Ar, the temperature at the center of the furnace was elevated to 300 °C at a ramping rate of 2 °C min<sup>-1</sup> and held at this temperature for 120 min, and then naturally cooled to ambient temperature under Ar. The loading of CoP on Ti mesh was calculated to be 0.8 mg cm<sup>-2</sup>.

#### Preparation of CoP@CoBiPi/Ti

To obtain CoP@CoBiPi/Ti, the CoP NA/Ti electrode  $(0.5 \times 0.5 \text{ cm})$  was used as the working electrode, Pt wire as auxiliary electrode and Ag/AgCl as reference electrode and polarized at 1.2 V (vs. Ag/

AgCl) in  $0.1\,\mathrm{M}$  KBi (pH 9.2) until the current density reached a plateau

#### Synthesis of RuO<sub>2</sub>

Typically,  $RuCl_3\cdot 3\,H_2O$  (0.01 mol) was added into distilled water (100 mL), and NaOH (1.0 m) was added to adjust the pH to 7. The mixed solution was stirred for 45 min at 100 °C and then centrifuged for 10 minutes and filtered. The precipitate was collected and washed with water several times. Finally, the product was dried at 80 °C overnight and annealed at 350 °C in air for 1 h. The as-prepared  $RuO_2$  powder (0.04 g) was dispersed into a solution of Nafion, ethanol, and water with a volume ratio of 20:480:500 by sonication, and deposited onto Ti mesh with a loading of 1.2 mg cm $^{-2}$ .

#### **Electrochemical measurements**

Electrochemical measurements were performed using a CHI 660E electrochemical analyzer (CH Instruments, Inc., Shanghai) in a conventional three-electrode cell system with Ag/AgCl (3  $\rm M$  KCl) as reference electrode. CoBi/Ti and Pt wire were used as working and counter electrodes, respectively. Overpotentials ( $\eta$ ) were calculated by the following equation:  $\eta\!=\!E$  (vs. RHE) $\!=\!E$  (vs. Ag/AgCl)+(0.197+0.059 pH) [V]. Polarization curves were obtained using LSV with a scan rate of 1 mV s $^{-1}$  in 0.1  $\rm M$  KBi electrolyte. All experiments were performed at room temperature (298 K).

#### Characterizations

Powder XRD data of the samples were collected with a Bruker D8 ADVANCE diffractiometer ( $\lambda = 1.5418$  Å). SEM measurements were performed on a XL30 ESEM FEG system at an accelerating voltage of 20 kV. TEM measurements were performed on a HITACHI H-8100 system (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan) with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. XPS measurements were collected with a Thermal ESCALAB 250 spectrometer using an AIK $_{\alpha}$  X-ray source (1486.6 eV photons). ICP–MS analysis was performed on Thermo Scientific iCAP6300.

#### Double-layer capacitance measurements

To measure the electrochemical double-layer capacitance ( $C_{\rm ell}$ ), the potential was swept from 0.94 to 1.04 V five times at five different scan rates (20, 60, 100, 140, and 180 mV s<sup>-1</sup>) with the assumption of double-layer charging in that potential range. The capacitive currents at 0.99 V were measured and plotted as a function of scan rate. A linear fit was used to determine  $C_{\rm ell}$  to be 150  $\mu \rm F \, cm^{-2}$ .

#### **TOF** calculations

The TOF  $(h^{-1})$  was calculated following equation [Eq. (1)]:

$$TOF = \frac{3600 \times I}{4nF} \tag{1}$$

Here *I* is current (A) during the LSV measurement in  $0.1 \,\mathrm{m}$  KBi, *F* is the Faradic constant (96485 Cmol<sup>-1</sup>), and *n* is the number of active site, which was calculated by the integrated charge over the oxidation peak of the CoP@CoBiPi at  $1.36 \,\mathrm{V}$  as shown in Figure 3 a.

# Communications

## Determination of FE

Under oxidative conditions, quantitative oxygen production experiments were performed with the CoP@CoBiPi/Ti as the working electrode. The generated gas was confirmed by GC analysis and measured quantitatively using a calibrated pressure sensor to monitor the pressure change in the cathode compartment of an H-type electrolytic cell. The number of moles of oxygen was calculated by the equation of PV=nRT, where V is the volume (m<sup>3</sup> ) for the equipment, R is 8.314 Jmol@<sup>1</sup> K @1 , T is 298 K, and P (Pa) is the pressure of the produced gas obtained from the pressure sensor. The theoretical amount of oxygen was calculated by assuming that all the charge passed through the working electrode was 4 e@ oxidation of water by Faraday's Law.

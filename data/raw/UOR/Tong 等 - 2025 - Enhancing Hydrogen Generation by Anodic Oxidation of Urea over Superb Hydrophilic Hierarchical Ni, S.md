Surface wettability are of great significance to electrocatalysts for various electrochemical reaction. In this work, Ni, S co-doped Co3(PO4)2 nanosheets on Ni foam (Ni-S-Co3(PO4)2 NSs) with high hydrophilicity and hierarchical structure are synthesized. The doping of S is the key factor to achieve an ultrahigh hydrophilic surface, identified by the contact angle measurement. As except, the as-prepared Ni-S-Co3(PO4)2 NSs display prominent activity for urea oxidation reaction (UOR), which reach the current density of 10 mA cm−<sup>2</sup> at a low potential of 1.28 V (vs. reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE) with excellent stability. Remarkably, when paired with Ni-Mo electrode to fabricate overall urea electrocatalysis device, a cell potential of mere 1.33 V is required to afford the current density of 10 mA cm−<sup>2</sup> , making the Ni-S-Co3(PO4)2 NSs an outstanding UOR electrocatalyst for efficient hydrogen production.

# **1. Introduction**

Electrochemical water splitting has been widely explored for sustainable hydrogen production.[\[1–3\]](#page-5-0) Nevertheless, a high equilibrium potential of 1.23 V is needed to overcome the sluggish anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in water splitting, which severely lowers energy conversion efficiencies.[\[4\]](#page-5-0) To address this, a more favorable oxidized reaction is demanded to enhance energy efficiency. The urea oxidation reaction (UOR), with a low equilibrium potential of 0.37 V (vs. RHE) and high hydrogen generation efficiency, has emerged as a promising alternative.[\[5–7\]](#page-5-0) Beyond its energy output, UOR offers environmental benefits by treating urea-rich wastewater from fertilizer and animal excreta.[\[8\]](#page-5-0) In spite of this, efficient electrocatalysts are still highly desired to overcome the sluggish kinetics of the primary step of UOR (CO(NH2)2 + 6OH- → N2 + CO2 + 5H2O + 6e- ). Although, Pt/Ru-based electrocatalysts can efficiently boost UOR process, their exorbitant price and scarcity necessitate the development of efficient and non-noble metal alternatives.[\[9\]](#page-5-0) As a result, transition metal-based electrocatalysts, including hydroxides,[\[10–12\]](#page-5-0) oxides,[\[13,14\]](#page-5-0) sulfides,[\[15,16\]](#page-5-0) and et al. have been widely studied.

Surface wettability plays a crucial role in the heterogeneous catalysis and significant impacts the electrocatalytic performance.[\[17\]](#page-5-0) As a result, achieving a hydrophilic surface is essential for the electrochemical reaction process in aqueous solution. Generally, hydrophilicity can be enhanced by doping heteroatoms into the electrocatalysts.[\[18\]](#page-6-0) Heteroatom-oxygencontaining groups, such as phosphate[\[19–21\]](#page-6-0) and sulfate,[\[22\]](#page-6-0) can greatly improve the hydrophilicity of electrocatalysts. Notably, metal phosphates demonstrate remarkable hydrophilicity and exhibit promising electrochemical properties. Consequently, they have been widely applied to catalyze electrochemical reactions, including water splitting,[\[23\]](#page-6-0) oxygen reduction reaction,[\[24\]](#page-6-0) and UOR.[\[25,26\]](#page-6-0) However, conventional synthesis for metal phosphates often involved heat treatment, which is time-consuming and complex.[\[27,28\]](#page-6-0) This hinders their wide-scale application potential. Consequently, it is highly desired to develop facile and efficient method for metal phosphate synthesis.

Among the phosphate-based materials, nickel phosphate has been recognized as an efficient electrocatalyst for UOR due to its tunable electronic and morphological structure.[\[29–31\]](#page-6-0) Similarly, cobalt phosphate has structural and functional similarities to the oxygen-evolving complex in photosystem II, where the phosphate species functioned as proton acceptors, enabling self-repairing capabilities to the catalyst.[\[32\]](#page-6-0) As a result, cobalt phosphate-based materials have attracted significant attention for water oxidation.[\[33\]](#page-6-0) However, their application in UOR remains limited and warrants further exploration. Additionally, element doping has proved to be an effectively approach for modulating the electronic structure of these materials, which in turn influences the adsorption of urea molecules and enhances UOR performance.

Hierarchical nanostructures have attracted significant attention due to their merits in exposing abundant reaction sites and facilitating bubble release.[\[34,35\]](#page-6-0) In this study, a one-pot

immersing process was proposed to synthesize hierarchical Ni, S-co-doped Co3(PO4)2 nanosheets (denoted as Ni-S-Co3(PO4)2 NSs) for UOR. Featuring a hierarchical structure and exceptional hydrophilicity, the prepared Ni-S-Co3(PO4)2 NSs exhibit attractive UOR activity with low onset potential, small Tafel slop, high electrocatalytic active surface areas (ECSA) and durability. Furthermore, when paired with Ni-Mo electrode, the integrated electrolysis system displays achieve a low cell voltage of 1.33 V to drive a current density of 10 mA cm−<sup>2</sup> . This highlights its potential for efficient hydrogen production.

# **2. Results and Discussion**

The formation process of Ni doped cobalt phosphate (denoted as Ni-Co3(PO4)2 electrode) and hierarchical Ni-S-Co3(PO4)2 NSs on Ni foam is illustrated in Figure 1. During the reaction, the nickel foam undergoes gradual etching by H<sup>+</sup> ions with the assistance of the dissolved O2. This facilitates a straightforward redox reaction at room, leading to the release of Ni2<sup>+</sup> ions. Concomitantly, the concentration of phosphate radicals increases because of the decompose of hydrogen phosphate ion under elevated pH conditions, which promote the deposition of cobalt phosphate. Meanwhile, the released Ni<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> ions participate in the coprecipitation process to produce Ni-doped cobalt phosphate. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurement confirmed this process. As shown in Figure S1, the diffraction peaks can be well indexed to monoclinic Co3(PO4)2·8H2O (JCPDS card No. 79– 0731). Furthermore, field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) images (Figure S2) reveal a rough surface, suggesting the successful deposition of Co3(PO4)2 on Ni foam. In sharp contrast, only flat surface is observed for pristine Ni foam substrate (Figure S3). Building upon this method, hierarchical Ni-S-Co3(PO4)2 NSs were synthesized by adding Na2S2O3·5H2O into the reaction solution with a similar procedure to that used for Ni-Co3(PO4)2 electrode.

The morphology of the as-prepared Ni-S-Co3(PO4)2 NSs was characterized using FESEM. As shown in Figure [2A,](#page-2-0) the three-dimension macroscopic structure of the Ni foam is well preserved after the reaction, which endows favorable mass transport and gas evolution. Magnified FESEM images reveal an interconnected nanosheet network (Figure [2B,C\)](#page-2-0). Such kind of structure ensures abundant active sites and improves efficient gas-bubble release that are both critical for electrochemical reactions.[\[36,37\]](#page-6-0) The hierarchical interconnected nanosheet structure was further confirmed by TEM image (Figure [2D\)](#page-2-0). The magnified TEM image (Figure [2E\)](#page-2-0) clearly reveals that these nanosheets are assembled from numerous interconnected nanoparticles. These sulfur-doped metal phosphate nanoparticles are believed to have abundant edge sites because of their small sized, which facilitates the absorption of OH- species.[\[38\]](#page-6-0) The crystal structure of the prepared NSs was analyzed using XRD and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM). XRD pattern (Figure S1) confirms that the NSs can be indexed to monoclinic Co3(PO4)2·8H2O (JCPDS card No. 79–0731). The observed lattice fringes with an interplanar spacing of 0.22 nm in HRTEM image (Figure [2F\)](#page-2-0) correspond to the (241) plane of Co3(PO4)2·8H2O. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurement (Figure S1) further indicates that the NSs can be indexed to monoclinic Co3(PO4)2·8H2O (JCPDS card No. 79–0731). The spatial distribution and presence of different elements within the NSs were proved by FESEM elemental mapping (Figure S4A–F). The results illustrate a homogeneous distribution of Ni, Co, P, O and S elements in the selected area. Finally, the chemical structure of the hierarchical Ni-S-Co3(PO4)2 NSs was elucidated through Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy.[\[39\]](#page-6-0) As shown in Figure S5, the FT-IR spectrum exhibits absorption peaks similar to those of the sulfur-free one, suggesting that the molecular-level structure of the cobalt phosphate is well retained after sulfur doping.

XPS measurements were carried out to determine the surface chemical compostion and oxidation state of Ni-S-Co3(PO4)2, Ni-Co3(PO4)2, and S-Co3(PO4)2, and the XPS binding energies were calibrated by the carbon energy of 284.80 eV. For Ni-S-Co3(PO4)2, the molar fraction of Ni, S and Co is approximately 1.7:1:8.3. The high-resolution Co 2p spectrum (Figure S6A) shows a clear spin-obit doublet centered at 781.4 and 797.2 eV, which

corresponds to the Co species in the cobalt phosphate.[\[40\]](#page-6-0) The P 2p spectrum exhibits a prominent peak at about 133.4 eV (Figure S6B), suggesting the formation of cobalt phosphate.[\[39\]](#page-6-0) In the O 1s XPS spectrum (Figure S6C), two peaks are observed. The one at about 531.2 belongs to the phosphate specie, and another one at 533.2 eV is the water of crystallization and adsorbed oxygen species.[\[41\]](#page-6-0) Doped atoms were also detected and analyzed. The peaks at 855.8 and 873.4 eV in Ni 2p spectrum are attributed to the Ni<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> species (Figure S6D).[\[42,43\]](#page-6-0) Additional peaks at 861.3 and 879.3 eV represent typical satellite peak for Ni species. The absence of metallic Ni peaks is obviously distinct from the nickel foam (Figure S6F), implying that the nickel foam was successfully etched. The S 2p spectrum (Figure S6E) displays peaks at 162.9 and 164.1 eV, corresponding to S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2 states, which are attributed to the metal-sulfur bonds in the sample. The peak at higher energy suggests the presence of oxidized sulfur species.[\[44\]](#page-6-0) These oxidized sulfur components are believed to impart hydrophilic properties to the electrocatalysts, which plays a vital role in enhancing the electrochemical performance.[\[22\]](#page-6-0) Interestingly, the doping of atoms trigger the shift of binding energy. The binding energies of the elements for Ni-Co3(PO4)2 are determined to be positive, because of the lower electronegativity for S atoms compared to O atoms. Furthermore, a negative shift of binding energies was found for S-Co3(PO4)2, resulting from the higher electronegativity of Ni atoms than Co atoms. The shifts in binding energies indicate a redistribution of electron density within the sample, leading to an influence on the urea adsorption energy. As shown in Figure S7, the Ni-S-Co3(PO4)2 possesses the greatest urea adsorption energy (−1.39 eV), implying its favorable adsorption and activation for urea molecule.[\[10,45\]](#page-5-0)

**Figure 3.** Contact angle of the as-prepared electrocatalysts changing with time: (A) Ni-Co3(PO4)2 electrode and (B) hierarchical Ni-S-Co3(PO4)2 NSs.

To have a deep insight into wettability of the as-obtained electrocatalysts, contact angle measurements over time were conducted. The pristine Ni foam substrate exhibits a large contact angle (Figure S8), implying its hydrophobic nature. In contrast, the wettability obviously improves for the Ni-Co3(PO4)2 electrode. As can be seen in Figure 3A, a much smaller contact angle is observed, and the water droplet spreads within 0.16 s, demonstrating that the Ni-Co3(PO4)2 electrode exhibits a hydrophilic surface. Remarkably, after doping sulfur into Co3(PO4)2, the water droplet spreads rapidly and is absorbed entirely upon contact with the surface (Figure 3B). This showcases the superb hydrophilic property of Ni-S-Co3(PO4)2 NSs. The enhanced wettability ensures sufficient contact between the electrolyte and electrocatalyst, thus promoting interfacial mass transfer and electron transport,[\[46\]](#page-6-0) which is crucial for efficient electrochemical reactions.

UOR measurements were conducted in a conventional threeelectrode cell at room temperature. Initially, the effects of reaction time on the UOR activity were investigated. The polarization curves in Figure S9 indicate that optimal UOR performance was achieved with a reaction time of 5 h. As expected, the hierarchical Ni-S-Co3(PO4)2 NSs demonstrated superior UOR activity compared to Ni-Co3(PO4)2 electrode and pristine nickel foam substrate (Figure 4A). For the hierarchical Ni-S-Co3(PO4)2 NSs, the potential to deliver the current density of 10 and 100 mA cm−<sup>2</sup> was determined to be 1.28 and 1.38 V (vs. RHE). However, the required potential was observed to be 1.33 and 1.57 V for Ni-Co3(PO4)2 electrode. The nickel foam substrate delivered negligible activity, with potential of 1.38 to achieve current density of 10 mA cm−<sup>2</sup> . Moreover, the UOR activity of RuO2 was also tested and found to be inferior to that of Ni-S-Co3(PO4)2 NSs (1.35 and 1.46 V at 10 and 100 mA cm−<sup>2</sup> ). Remarkably, the hierarchical Ni-S-Co3(PO4)2 NSs outperformed most of the documented UOR electrocatalysts (Table S1). The excellent UOR activity of the NSs can be attribute to their remarkable hydrophilicity and hierarchical structure, which endow them with high ECSA (Figure S10) and favorable gas-bubble detachment (Figure S11). To have a deep understand of the intrinsic activity of the electrocatalysts, current density was normalized to ECSA. As demonstrated in Figure S12, the hierarchical Ni-S-Co3(PO4)2 NSs still deliver higher normalized current density than that of Ni-Co3(PO4)2 electrode, highlighting their outstandingly intrinsical activity. Additionally, Figure 4B displays the polarization curves of hierarchical Ni-S-Co3(PO4)2 NSs for UOR and OER. As can be seen, the broad oxidation peak in the OER curve (1.21 to 1.55 V vs. RHE) is ascribed to the oxidation of Ni(II) to Ni(III) and Co(II) to Co(III) and Co(IV) species.[\[47,48\]](#page-6-0) In contrast, the anodic current density for UOR rapidly increase upon adding urea, accompanied by the vanishment of the oxidation peak. This reveals their highly efficient UOR. Moreover, the UOR process triggered at the potential where high-valence metal cations appear, consistent with the previous studies.[\[49\]](#page-6-0) During the UOR process, the Ni(II) and Co(II) species are readily to be oxidized at a high potential. Then, the urea molecules are tended to be oxidized with the presence the high-valence Ni and Co species.[\[50\]](#page-6-0)

The outstanding electrocatalytic activity of Ni-S-Co3(PO4)2 NSs is further evidenced by the low Tafel slop (90 mV dec−<sup>1</sup> ), while which is as high as 133 mV dec−<sup>1</sup> for Ni-Co3(PO4)2 electrode (Figure 4C). Furthermore, EIS tests were carried out to elucidated the charge-transfer abilities. The Nyquist plots are fitted to an equivalent electronic circuit (Figure S13), including a series solution-spreading resistance, a change-transfer resistance (Rct), and a constant phase-element (CPE). Ni-S-Co3(PO4)2 NSs have a lower charge-transfer resistance (8.56 -) compared to the Ni-Co3(PO4)2 (20.80 -). The small Rct for Ni-S-Co3(PO4)2 NSs indicates its fast electron transfer rate and favorable faradaic process.[\[50\]](#page-6-0) This is favorable for UOR activity. Longterm durability, one of the most crucial evaluation criteria for electrocatalyst, is of great necessity to be assessed. As the multi-current curve recorded in Figure 4D, the potential can immediately level off and maintain stability, once the current is changed. Such rapid response further verifies advantageous

mass transfer property and structural robustness for hierarchical Ni-S-Co3(PO4)2 NSs.[\[51,52\]](#page-6-0) Meanwhile, the chronopotentiometry measurement at a constant current density of 100 mA cm−<sup>2</sup> with negligible change on potential over 40 h provides the solid evidence to prove the stability of the hierarchical Ni-S-Co3(PO4)2 NSs toward UOR (Figure [4E\)](#page-3-0). Additionally, the decline of potential to drive a current density of 10 mA cm−<sup>2</sup> is only 20 mV after the long-term durability (polarization curves in Figure [4F\)](#page-3-0), further suggesting its remarkable electrochemical stability. Poststructural characterizations of FESEM (Figure S14) and TEM images (Figure S15) demonstrate that the interconnected network, hierarchical structure and microstrucutre can be well preserved after the durability test, further implying the good robustness of the as-prepared electrocatalyst. To investigate the effect of Ni species on the UOR activity, the Ni-free electrode was also prepared by using Co foam as substrate with similar strategy to that of Ni-S-Co3(PO4)2 NSs. FESEM images (Figure S16) and XRD pattern (Figure S1) confirm that the as-obtained Ni-free product (S-Co3(PO4)2) are monoclinic Co3(PO4)2·8H2O with shape in nanosheet. The polarization curves and the corresponding Tafel plots of Ni-S-Co3(PO4)2 NSs and S- Co3(PO4)2 are displayed in Figure S17. The potential to drive the current density of 10 mA cm−<sup>2</sup> is close for Ni-S-Co3(PO4)2 NSs and S-Co3(PO4)2 NSs, but the difference of the potential become larger at a higher current density. This result suggests that the Ni species in Ni-S-Co3(PO4)2 NSs play an important role in boosting the kinetics of UOR process, confirmed by the smaller Tafel slope of Ni-S-Co3(PO4)2 NSs (Figure S17B).

Furthermore, the overall urea electrolyzer was fabricated by using the as-prepared hierarchical Ni-S-Co3(PO4)2 NSs as anode and Ni-Mo electrode as cathode (Figure 5A). With potential applied, gas bubbles can be clearly seen at both anode and cathode. The Ni-Mo electrode was synthesized through a facile electrodeposition strategy according to the literature[\[53\]](#page-6-0) (detailed in Experiment Section). FESEM images indicate that Ni-Mo electrode was successfully prepared with shape in aggregated particles (Figure S18). The selection of Ni-Mo electrode as cathode in this system is attributed to its low cost, convenient synthesis, and extremely outstanding HER activity with a low overpotential of 33 mV at 10 mA cm−<sup>2</sup> . Expectedly, the voltage required to drive a current density of 10 mA cm−<sup>2</sup> in this urea electrolysis cell is merely 1.33 V, which is almost 90 mV lower than that in the water electrolysis cell (Figure 5B), clearly confirming its prominent efficiency of urea electrolysis and hydrogen generation. Notably, the assembled urea electrolyzer can be smoothly operated for at both low current density and high current density for 20 h (Figure 5C). Moreover, the polarization curves of the initial and post-UOR electrocatalysts are almost overlap (Figure S19). These results confirm the UOR durability of Ni-S-Co3(PO4)2 NSs.

# **3. Conclusion**

In summary, we demonstrate that incorporating sulfur into Ni-Co3(PO4)2 significantly enhances its hydrophilicity and serves as an effective strategy to develop an advanced electrocatalyst for UOR. Compared to the sulfur-free counterpart, the hierarchical Ni-S-Co3(PO4)2 NSs exhibits excellent UOR performance, with a low potential of 1.28 V (vs. RHE) to drive a current density of 10 mA cm−<sup>2</sup> . Furthermore, when paired with cathodic Ni-Mo electrode, the electrolysis system illustrated excellent activity. This work highlights a simple yet effective approach to enhance the hydrophilic properties of metal phosphates, offering promising insights for the construction of UOR electrocatalysts.

# **4. Experimental Section**

## **4.1. Synthesis of Hierarchical Ni-S-Co3(PO4)2 NSs**

All chemical reagents were analytical grade and used as received without further purification. The Ni foam with size of 3 <sup>×</sup> 4 cm<sup>2</sup> was first cleaned by ethanol and hydrochloric acid solution (3 M). Typically, 2.5 mmol of Na2S2O3·5H2O and 5 mmol of Co(NO3)2·6H2O were dissolved into 20 mL of PBS solution (pH = 4) to deliver a clear solution, then the pre-treated Ni foam was dipped into the above solution for 5 h. Subsequently, the Ni foam was washed with deionized water and anhydrous ethanol for several times to obtain hierarchical Ni-S-Co3(PO4)2 NSs.

### 4.2. Synthesis of Ni-Co<sub>3</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> Electrode

#### 4.3. Synthesis of S-Co<sub>3</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> Electrode

The Ni-free electrode was prepared via a similar strategy with that of the hierarchical Ni-S-Co<sub>3</sub>(PO4)<sub>2</sub> NSs by using Co foam as substrate.

#### 4.4. Synthesis of Ni-Mo Electrode

A facile electrodeposition process was carried out similar to the reported work. [53] Typically, the electrolyte was obtained by dissolving 10.5 mmol of NiCl<sub>2</sub>·6H<sub>2</sub>O, 1 mmol of (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>6</sub>Mo<sub>7</sub>O<sub>24</sub>·4H<sub>2</sub>O, 21 mmol of sodium citrate tribasic dehydrate and 21 mmol of NaCl into 70 mL of deionized water. The pH of the solution was adjusted to about 8 by adding ammonia. The electrochemical deposition of Ni-Mo was performed in a conventional two-electrode cell at room temperature for 1000 s with pre-treated Cu foam (0.5  $\times$  1 cm²) as working electrode and Pt wire as counter electrode. Subsequently, the Cu foam was washed with deionized water to obtain Ni-Mo electrode.

#### 4.5. Materials Characterizations

FESEM images were recorded through a Hitachi S-4800 field emission scanning electron microscope. TEM and HRTEM measurements were performed on a Philips CM200 with the acceleration voltage of 160 kV. XPS analysis was carried out using Thermo Scientific Al K-Alpha<sup>+</sup> X-ray photoelectron spectrometer. The XPS binding energies were calibrated by the carbon energy of 284.80 eV. Contact angle was determined by a Dataphysics DCAT21 goniometer.

## 4.6. Electrochemical Measurements

The electrochemical tests were conducted in a conventional three-electrode or two-electrode cell using an electrochemical workstation at room temperature (CHI 660E). The as prepared electrodes  $(0.5 \times 1~\text{cm}^2)$  were directly utilized as working electrode. The counter electrode was carbon rod and the reference electrode was saturated calomel electrode (SCE). The 1 M KOH with 0.33 M urea and 1 M KOH electrolyte were selected as the electrolyte for UOR and OER tests, respectively. All the potentials were calibrated to RHE according to the Nernst equation ( $E_{RHE} = E_{SCE} + 0.059 pH + 0.242$ ). The impedance data were obtained through electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) tests at 1.36 V vs. RHE in the range of  $10^5$ -0.01 Hz with 5 mV sinusoidal perturbations. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were conducted at a scan rate of 5 mV s $^{-1}$ .

## 4.7. Computational Methodology

Theoretical calculations were conducted on CP2K 2022.2 package. [54] Self-consistent field was set to be  $1 \times 10^{-5}$ , with DIAGONALIZATION, UKS, BROYDEN\_MIXING (ALPHA = 0.1, NBROYDEN = 24), and SMEAR applied. Cut-off energy were 500 Ry, with REL\_CUTOFF of 50. The pseudopotential was double- $\xi$  basis set Goedecker-Teter-Hutter and

exchange interaction was Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof.<sup>[55–59]</sup> A vacuum layer of 15 Å was applied for all boxes. Energy changes are determined as follows:

$$\Delta E_{\rm ads} = E_{\rm adsorbate/slab} - E_{\rm adsorbate} - E_{\rm slab}$$

# Controlled synthesis of M doped NiVS (M = Co, Ce and Cr) as a robust electrocatalyst for urea electrolysis†

Chao Wang, a Qirun Wang, a Xiaoqiang Du \* a and Xiaoshuang Zhang b

Urea electrolysis can be used to treat wastewater containing urea and alleviate the energy crisis, so it is one of the best ways to solve environmental and energy problems. This paper reports the synthesis of M doped NiVS (M = Co, Ce and Cr) composites by a simple hydrothermal process for the first time. What is noteworthy is that the Ce-NiVS material as a catalytic electrode requires only 141 mV overpotential for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and 1.291 V potential for the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) at a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> in 1.0 M KOH and 0.5 M urea mixed alkaline solution. Using Ce-NiVS/NF as both the anode and cathode for urea electrolysis, a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> is driven by a voltage of only 1.55 V, which is better than most previous catalysts. Experimental results demonstrate that the excellent catalytic activity of Ce-NiVS materials is due to the formation of a large number of active sites and the improvement of conductivity due to doping with Ce. Density functional theory calculation shows that the VS<sub>4</sub> material has a small Gibbs free energy of hydrogen adsorption, which plays a major role in the hydrogen production process, and Ce-NiS has a higher density of states (DOS) near the Fermi level, indicating that Ce-NiS has better electronic conductivity. The synergistic catalysis of VS<sub>4</sub> and Ce-NiS promoted the hydrogen production performance of the Ce-NiVS material. This work provides guidance for the optimization and design of low-cost electrocatalysts to replace expensive precious metal-based electrocatalysts for overall urea electrolysis.

## 1. Introduction

In order to solve the environmental problems caused by the large consumption of traditional fossil energy for a long time and the problem of the energy crisis, focusing on the availability of clean and renewable hydrogen energy can be one of the best answers. <sup>1-4</sup> Electrochemical water decomposition using the electrical energy generated by wind, solar and other renewable energy sources is a highly anticipated method to achieve sustainable hydrogen regeneration and optimize the energy structure. <sup>5-9</sup> In order to further enhance the environmental cleaning capacity and reduce the need for fresh water for electrochemical water decomposition, electrochemical water decomposition combining the electricity generated from renewable energy with seawater and domestic wastewater con-

tageous, but the same challenge arises in the need for efficient bifocal catalysts to accelerate the urea electrolysis process. <sup>10–15</sup> Among existing catalysts, precious metals such as platinum,

taining urea to obtain purified hydrogen is more advan-

ruthenium and their derivatives have excellent catalytic activity, but their high price and scarce reserves limit their large-scale application in industry. 16-19 So finding an efficient and stable non-precious metal catalyst is now a more valuable challenge.20-22 Recently, non-precious metal catalysts have received attention mainly focused on sulfides,<sup>23</sup> phosphides, 24,25 oxides/hydroxides, 19 nitrides, 26 etc. What is noteworthy is that sulfides have the advantages of low price and high electrocatalytic efficiency.<sup>27-29</sup> However, the performance of monomeric sulfides is still not comparable to that of noble-metal catalysts, so the electrocatalytic activity can be improved by constructing the heterogeneous structure of bimetallic sulfides and doping with other metal atoms, and combining the advantages of the two methods to improve the electronic structure and microstructure.  $^{30-35}$

bridging S22- can act as both an active site and an electron acceptor for HER, which is conducive to enhancing the overall catalytic activity. 39-41 It is important to construct the heterogeneous structures of Ni and V bimetallic sulfides for the electrochemical study of non-noble metal sulfides. 42-44 It has been proved that it is feasible to adjust the electronic structure by introducing other metal elements into the catalyst, and the catalytic performance of a single metal catalyst is more obvious. 45-48 In addition to transition metals, rare-earth elements (such as Ce, Pr, etc.) have a unique 4f electron, which can significantly improve the catalytic efficiency when combined with other active catalysts. 49-51 As an important rareearth element, Ce also has a mixed electron/ionic conductivity due to the redox action between Ce<sup>3+</sup> and Ce<sup>4+</sup>, which shows a significant improvement in performance compared with that of the original catalyst. 50-53 It is worth noting that although researchers have done a lot of work, both activity and stability are still a long way from practical industrial applications. Our goal is to improve the activity and stability of the catalyst by

means of doping and constructing heterogeneous interfaces. In this paper, the synthesis of M doped NiVS (M = Co, Ce and Cr) composites was completed by a simple hydrothermal process for the first time. Upon adjusting the heterostructure and introducing Ce doping, Ce-NiVS exhibits both superior hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR) activities, and its stability performance is also satisfactory. Analyses such as characterization tests showed that the improved performance was due to the generation of a large number of active sites and the improvement of the material conductivity. The highly efficient heterostructure composed of Ce doped VS4 and NiS self-supported on Ni foam also has a good urea splitting performance in a two-electrode system. When Ce-NiVS is used as the anode and cathode at the same time to assemble an alkaline electrolyzer, Ce-NiVS shows a low application potential of 1.55 V to stimulate urea decomposition at a voltage of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> and maintains good catalytic stability. In addition, the construction strategy of such nanostructures in our work can be extended to the development of novel electrocatalytic urea electrolysis functional materials for preparation.

# 2. Experimental

## 2.1 Chemicals and reagents

Urea  $(CO(NH_2)_2)$  was purchased from Tianjin Damao Chemical Reagent Factory. Cobalt nitrate hexahydrate  $(CO(NO_3)_2 \cdot 6H_2O)$ , ammonium fluoride  $(NH_4F)$  and sodium sulfide  $(Na_2S)$  were purchased from Sinopod Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Vanadium chloride  $(VCl_3)$  was purchased from Tianjin Fengchuan Chemical Reagent Technology Co., Ltd. Potassium hydroxide was purchased from Tianjin Beichen Founder Reagent Factory. Concentrated hydrochloric acid  $(HCl, 12 \text{ mol } L^{-1})$  was purchased from Chengdu Colon Chemical Co., Ltd. Cerium nitrate  $(CeN_4O_{12})$  and chromium nitrate  $(CeN_3O_9 \cdot 9H_2O)$  were purchased from Shanghai Macklin

Biochemical Technology Co., Ltd. Nickel foam (NF, 0.5 mm thick) was obtained from Suzhou Kesheng Metal Materials Co., Ltd. In addition, deionized water (DIW) is purified using a water purification system.

#### 2.2 Preparation of precursors

In order to eliminate the oxides and impurities attached to the surface of nickel foam, it is necessary to pretreat nickel foam firstly. Nickel foam (size: 3 × 6 cm) was ultrasound-treated with hydrochloric acid and acetone for 15 min, and then washed with ethanol and deionized water to obtain pure nickel foam. The precursor was prepared by dissolving 0.63 g VCl<sub>3</sub>, 0.59 g NH<sub>4</sub>F, and 1.2 g CO (NH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub> in 60 mL DIW. The resulting solution and the pre-treated nickel foam (3 × 6 cm) are then transferred to a stainless-steel Teflon-coated autoclave with a volume of 80 mL. Subsequently, the hydrothermal reaction was conducted for 12 h at 150 °C. After natural cooling to room temperature, the Ni foam was rinsed three times with deionized water and ethanol. The precursor of NiV was obtained after vacuum drying at 60 °C. The precursor of NiV doped with different metal elements was obtained by adding 0.1 mmol cerium nitrate, cobalt nitrate or chromium nitrate.

#### 2.3 The preparation of Ce-NiVS/NF

0.48 g Na $_2$ S was dissolved in a solvent mixed with 30 mL methanol and 30 mL deionized water, and the precursor obtained in the previous step and the prepared solutions were transferred again to a stainless-steel Teflon-coated autoclave with a volume of 80 mL. Subsequently, the hydrothermal reaction was conducted for 5 h at 120 °C. After natural cooling to room temperature, the material was rinsed three times with deionized water and ethanol. Ce-NiVS and other control samples were obtained after vacuum drying at 60 °C.

#### 2.4 Characterization and electrochemical test

X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were acquired using the Rigaku D/max-2200 V diffractometer with Cu K $\alpha$  radiation. The morphology of the samples was studied by infrared emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM) on a Sigma-300 microscope. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed on the Axis Ultra DLD Kratos AXIS SUPRA X-ray photoelectron spectrometer. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements were performed on an FEI-Tecnai F20 microscope.

All electrochemical measurements were performed at room temperature using an electrochemical workstation (CHI 760E) for UOR and HER tests with a typical three-electrode setup. In 1.0 M KOH and 0.5 M urea electrolyte, a Hg/HgO electrode was used as the reference electrode, a graphite rod was used as the counter electrode, and the resulting catalyst with 1 × 1 cm<sup>2</sup> module was used as the working electrode. When testing and processing electrocatalytic data, all recorded potentials are corrected according to the formula  $E_{\rm RHE} = E_{\rm Hg/HgO} + 0.098 + 0.059$  × pH (1 M KOH, pH = 13.6). All electrochemical data are IR compensated with 70%.

# 3. Results and discussion

**Dalton Transactions** 

The preparation process of the Ce-NiVS electrode is shown in Fig. 1. It can be prepared through a simple two-step hydrothermal process. The first step is to control the morphology and electronic structure by controlling the type of doping element in the hydrothermal process. The addition of ammonium fluoride is to adjust the morphology of the material. During the heating process, urea will release hydroxide and carbonate ions, which will be complexed with metal ions to form precipitation and play the role of a precipitating agent. In the second hydrothermal phase, sodium sulfide is used as a sulfur source to vulcanize the precursor of NiV. Sulfur ions diffuse inwards on the surface of the material and hydroxide and carbonate ions diffuse outwards, and they exchange with each other to form the sulfide.

#### 3.1 Characterization results

As shown in Fig. 2a, it can be seen by X-ray diffraction (XRD) that the diffraction peaks of the Ce-NiVS electrode match those of NiS (PDF# 02-1280) and VS<sub>4</sub> (PDF# 14-0179), and the crystal phase of the Ce-NiVS electrode is analyzed. The characteristic peaks of Ce-NiVS hybrid electrodes are located at 30.17°, 34.74°, 46.03°, 53.55°, and 60.89°, which correspond to the (100), (101), (102), (110), and (103) surfaces of NiS (PDF# 02-1280), respectively. The characteristic peaks at 24.23°, 28.49°, 31.58°, 39.67°, and 40.60° correspond to the (310), (-202), (-231), (312), and (-422) faces of VS<sub>4</sub> (PDF# 14-0179), respectively. It is worth noting that three distinct strong peaks at 44.58°, 53.67°, and 76.60° correspond to the (111), (200) and (220) faces of Ni foam. Because the peak of nickel foam is too strong to cover the diffraction peak of the material, we tried to scrape the material off the nickel foam, but because the load is too small, we failed. The XRD results also show that Ce-NiVS been successfully prepared on nickel foam. Characterization of control materials is also provided in Fig. S1-3.† In order to further verify the microcrystalline structure and surface information of Ce-NiVS electrode materials,

transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) were used to observe them (Fig. 2b). HR-TEM results are shown in Fig. 2c. In high-resolution images, a distinct heterostructure was observed between NiS and VS<sub>4</sub>, with lattice fringes of a spacing of 0.29 nm, which corresponds to the (100) face of NiS. The lattice fringe of 0.29 nm can be attributed to the (310) face of VS<sub>4</sub>, which corresponds to the results of XRD. With the formation of a heterogeneous structure, a clear interface is formed, which may have a large amount of charge distribution and abundant catalytic active sites, thus improving the electrocatalytic performance of Ce-NiVS materials.

The structure and morphology of the catalyst were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). As shown in Fig. 3, the morphology of the prepared electrode is also different due to the doping of different elements. In the absence of the addition of doping elements, it can be seen in Fig. 3a that NiVS presents a layered growth structure of nanocubes, indicating the formation of a layered structure. After the addition of doping elements, the nanocubes appear to collapse in different forms and degrees to reconstitute the polymer nanospheres. The surface of the Ce-NiVS electrode (Fig. 3c) was rougher than that of the Co-NiVS electrode (Fig. 3b), which may bring a larger catalytic interface and contain more catalytic active sites. What is noteworthy is that the Cr-NiVS electrode exhibits a microsphere structure composed of nanosheets (Fig. 3d). The SEM-energy dispersion

Paper **Dalton Transactions** 

spectrum (SEMEDS) (Fig. 3e and Fig. S4, 5†) shows the element composition and dispersion, and we can see that Ce, Ni, V and S elements coexist uniformly in Ce-NiVS. The results show that doping of different ions will lead to the different morphologies of the Co-NiVS, Ce-NiVS and Cr-NiVS materials.

The surface chemical structure and electronic coordination of the prepared Ce-NiVS were further studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Fig. 4a shows the Ce 3d region; the peaks near 881.2 and 873.5 eV are attributed to Ce<sup>4+</sup> and  $\text{Ce}^{3+}$ , pointing to the Ce  $3d_{5/2}$  region. Peaks near 904.2 eV and 894.0 eV also belong to  $Ce^{4+}$  and  $Ce^{3+}$ , pointing to the Ce  $3d_{3/2}$ region. It is suggested that Ce<sup>3+</sup> and Ce<sup>4+</sup> coexist in Ce-NiVS, which may lead to more flexible redox reactions.<sup>54</sup> Fig. 4b shows the spectrum of Ni 2p; the characteristic peaks at 873.8 eV and 855.4 eV point to Ni 2p<sub>1/2</sub> and Ni 2p<sub>3/2</sub>, respectively. The partial vulcanization of the nickel foam matrix can be proved by the change of nickel base state of the nickel foam itself. The V 2p spectrum of Fig. 4c shows that the peaks of V  $2p_{3/2}$  and V  $2p_{1/2}$  at 516.97 eV and 524.03 eV belong to V(IV), with the characteristics of V<sup>4+</sup>, confirming the formation of the VS<sub>4</sub> phase in Ce-NiVS.<sup>39</sup> In the S 2p spectrum of Fig. 4d, the characteristic peak at 169.0 eV is attributed to S-O, and the S 2p<sub>3/2</sub> and S 2p<sub>3/2</sub> peaks are observed at 162.41 eV and 163.61 eV, respectively. Fig. 4e shows the common Ni, V, S, C, and O elements in NiVS and Ce-NiVS, and the Ce element in Ce-NiVS. It is worth noting that compared with the NiVS material, the position of each spectral characteristic peak is shifted to a certain extent due to the introduction of the Ce element, which proves that there is an interface and electron transfer between NiVS and Ce-NiVS materials.

#### 3.2 Catalytic performance of materials

Based on the characterization results, in order to evaluate the electrocatalytic performance of the catalyst, the polarization curves were obtained by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) in 1.0 M KOH and 0.5 M urea. The catalytic activity of samples prepared with different doping elements was evaluated, and the UOR activity of Ce-NiVS was significantly better than those of NiVS, Co-NiVS and Cr-NiVS (Fig. 5a). Similarly, Fig. 5b shows the potentials of the four catalysts prepared at current densities of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> and 100 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. At current densities of

10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> and 100 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, Ce-NiVS only requires potentials of 1.291 V and 1.34 V, showing the excellent catalytic activity of Ce-NiVS. By calculating and analyzing the Tafel slope (Fig. 5c), the Tafel slope of the Ce-NiVS sample is 43.53 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>, which is much smaller than those of NiVS  $(71.2 \text{ mV dec}^{-1})$ , Co-NiVS  $(85.19 \text{ mV dec}^{-1})$  and Cr-NiVS (65.52 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>), indicating that the electron transfer efficiency of Ce-NiVS is faster in the process of UOR catalysis; that is, the reaction kinetics of Ce-NiVS is faster. In addition, according to CV curves measured at different scanning rates (Fig. S6 $\dagger$ ), the electrochemical double layer capacitance ( $C_{\rm dl}$ ) was obtained, as shown in Fig. 5d, and the ECSA value was positively correlated with  $C_{\rm dl}$  to reveal the intrinsic activity of the catalyst. Ce-NiVS has a larger  $C_{\rm dl}$  value (18.98 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>), which is much higher than NiVS (1.98 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>), Co-NiVS (1.99 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>) and Cr-NiVS (1.88 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>). This means that larger ECSAs have more available active sites. Their charge transfer kinetics was characterized using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) (Fig. 5e), and Ce-NiVS still has the smallest semicircle diameter and therefore exhibits the smallest charge transfer resistance  $(R_{ct})$ , thus exhibiting a

**Dalton Transactions** Paper

faster electron transfer rate in the UOR electron transfer step, which is consistent with the high activity of Ce-NiVS. When comparing the potential at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> (Fig. 5f and Table S1†), the Ce-NiVS catalyst is superior to other recently reported UOR catalysts.

Similarly, the activity of the Ce-NiVS catalytic material in HER is also superior to that of NiVS, Co-NiVS and Cr-NiVS (Fig. 6a). Fig. 6b shows the potentials of the four catalysts prepared at current densities of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> and 50 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. At current densities of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> and 50 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, Ce-NiVs only require overpotentials of 141 mV and 219 mV, indicating that the introduction of the Ce system helps in improving the activity. Through calculation and analysis of the Tafel slope (Fig. 6c), the Tafel slope of the Ce-NiVS sample was 114.67 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>. It is much smaller than that of NiVS (136.78 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>), Co-NiVS (150.37 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>) and Cr-NiVS (165.25 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>), indicating that the electron transport efficiency of Ce-NiVS in the HER catalytic process is also faster. The small Tafel slope means that H<sub>2</sub> production increases rapidly with increasing overpotential. When comparing  $C_{\rm dl}$  (Fig. 6d and Fig. S7†), Ce-NiVS has a larger  $C_{\rm dl}$  value (9.09 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>) than NiVS (0.66 mF

cm<sup>-2</sup>), Co-NiVS (0.58 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>) and Cr-NiVS (1.05 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>). The larger  $C_{dl}$  of Ce-NiVS represents a larger ECSA value. The results of the EIS curve show (Fig. 6e) that the electron transfer process of Ce-NiVS in HER is much faster than that of NiVS, Co-NiVS and Cr-NiVS in HER, indicating that Ce-NiVS has excellent electronic conductivity and therefore has faster reaction kinetics during electrocatalysis of HER. Compared with the potential of other catalysts at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> (Fig. 6f and Table S2†), the Ce-NiVS catalyst still shows a superior performance. The electrocatalytic performance of Ce-NiVS as a catalyst in the UOR and HER two-part reactions was tested. The results showed that Ce-NiVS has strong competitiveness as a bifunctional urea splitting catalyst.

#### 3.3 Urea electrolysis and stability test

Ce-NiVS, as an excellent bifunctional electrocatalyst for UOR and HER, was assembled in an alkaline electrolytic cell as both the anode and cathode for urea electrolysis using a dual electrode structure at 1 M KOH and 0.5 M urea (Fig. 7d). A current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> is driven by a voltage of only 1.55 V, which is comparable to or better than some other dualfunction catalysts for urea electrolytic cells of the same type (Fig. 7b and Table S3†). The electrocatalyst showed good stability in a durability test at a constant voltage of 1.55 V for 15 hours (Fig. 7c). The digital photo inserted in Fig. 7d clearly shows that CO2, N2, and H2 bubbles are created on the electrode surface during the splitting process. The slight improvement in performance after stability tests in Fig. 7a and c may be due to the redox interaction between Ce<sup>3+</sup> and Ce<sup>4+</sup>, which has mixed electron/ion conductivity and speeds up the reaction kinetics. In addition, we investigated the performance of

the Ce-NiVS catalyst in an alkaline seawater environment and an alkaline seawater and urea environment (Fig. S8 and S9†).

In this paper, XRD, XPS and other characterization methods were used to investigate the difference between the physical and chemical properties of the catalyst after the stability test and the fresh catalyst, so as to determine whether the target catalyst is metamorphic. After the stability test for 15 h, the XRD pattern showed that no new impure peaks appeared in the XRD images except for slight changes in the peak intensity, and the peak location of the catalyst before and after the test was the same (Fig. S10†), indicating that the subtle changes of the material only occurred in the component content, but not in the chemical composition. The XPS investigation of fresh and recovered Ce-NiVS showed no significant difference in the XPS spectra of Ce, Co, S, and V elements compared to those of the catalyst before the test (Fig. 8a-e), indicating that the electronic environment in which these elements were tested did not obviously change after the stability test. It is worth noting that the signal of sulfate is much stronger after the reaction, which proves that in situ oxidation occurs on the surface of the catalyst (Fig. 8d). The SEM image of Fig. 8f shows that, compared with fresh Ce-NiVS, the morphology basically maintains its initial shape, and a certain degree of etching occurs on the surface of the nanosphere.

The role of the prepared Ce-NiVS electrode's composition in the catalytic process was investigated by density functional theory so as to better explore the mechanism of the Ce-NiVS electrode in HER. Fig. S11a and b† show a ball-and-stick model constructed by splitting the Ce-NiVS electrode into two parts, Ce-NiS and VS<sub>4</sub>. The reaction kinetics of HER, i.e. the hydrogen evolution reaction rate of the catalyst, is largely determined by the interaction strength of the catalytic active center H\*, expressed by the Gibbs free energy ( $\Delta G_{H^*}$ ). When  $\Delta G_{\mathrm{H}^*}$  is close to 0, the adsorption and desorption of H are more likely to occur; that is, it is conducive to electron transfer, and the value of  $\Delta G_{H^*}$  can be used to measure the HER activity of the catalytic material. Fig. S11c† shows the Gibbs free energy of Ce-NiS and VS<sub>4</sub> materials for H\*. It is noteworthy that the Gibbs free energy of VS<sub>4</sub> ( $\Delta G_{H^*} = 0.31$  eV) is closer to 0 than that of Ce-NiS ( $\Delta G_{H^*} = 0.92 \text{ eV}$ ), indicating that VS<sub>4</sub> has a

faster adsorption and desorption reaction to H\*. This suggests that VS<sub>4</sub> plays a real catalytic role in the catalytic reaction. As can be seen from Fig. S11d,† the density of states (DOS) of Ce-NiS near the Fermi level is higher than that of VS<sub>4</sub>, indicating that Ce-NiS has better electronic conductivity, and rapid electron transfer is conducive to improving HER electrochemical activity. The results showed that Ce doping made Ce-NiS have better electronic conductivity and further improved the kinetics of urea electrolysis reaction. In addition, the projected densities of states (PDOS) of Ce-NiS and VS4 atoms are shown in Fig. S12 and S13.† The total state density of Ce-NiS comes mainly from the d orbitals of Ce, the d orbitals of Ni and the p orbitals of S, while the total state density of VS<sub>4</sub> comes mainly from the d orbitals of V and the p orbitals of S. In summary, Ce-NiS and VS<sub>4</sub> work together to improve electron conductivity and accelerate electron transfer, thus increasing the H\* adsorption energy and electron distribution of Ce-NiVS electrodes, and the optimized scheme can significantly improve the catalytic activity of HER.

## 4. Conclusion

In summary, we report the rational design and synthesis of M doped NiVS (M = Co, Ce and Cr) nanoarrays grown on nickel foam, which alter the morphology of the catalyst by changing the doped elements. The optimized Ce-NiVS has an enhanced ECSA, lower  $R_{ct}$  and good stability. The Ce-NiVS catalyst has significant electrocatalytic activity for HER, UOR and overall urea electrolysis. The results show that Ce-NiVS as a catalytic electrode requires only an overpotential of 141 mV for HER and a potential of 1.291 V for UOR to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> in a mixed alkaline solution of 1.0 M KOH and 0.5 M urea. Using Ce-NiVS/NF as both the anode and cathode to achieve urea electrolysis, the current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> is driven by a voltage of only 1.55 V. Density functional theory calculation shows that the VS4 material has a small Gibbs free energy of hydrogen adsorption, which plays a major role in the hydrogen production process, and Ce-NiS has a higher density of states (DOS) near the Fermi level, indicating that Ce-NiS has better electronic conductivity. The synergistic catalysis of VS<sub>4</sub> and Ce-NiS promoted the hydrogen production performance of the Ce-NiVS material. This work provides a general method for producing electrocatalysts with high activity and stability for urea electrolysis.

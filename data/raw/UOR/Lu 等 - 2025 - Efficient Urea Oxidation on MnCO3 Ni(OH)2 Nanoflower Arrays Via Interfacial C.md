Nan Lu,[a, c] Hao Guo,[a] Fozia Sultana,[a] Jie Zhang,[a] Xiaoqing Yan,\*[b] and [Renhong Li\\*](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8327-5506)[a]

The electrochemical urea oxidation reaction (UOR) presents an energy-efficient alternative to the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER), operating at a substantially lower thermodynamic potential and thereby reducing the energy input for hydrogen production by approximately 70%. Simultaneously, UOR facilitates wastewater remediation, offering dual environmental and energy benefits. In this work, we report a MnCO3/Ni(OH)2 heterostructured nanoflower array directly grown on conductive carbon cloth that exhibits outstanding UOR catalytic activity and stability. The catalyst achieves remarkably low overpotentials of 90 mV at 10 mA·cm−<sup>2</sup> and 167 mV at 200 mA·cm−<sup>2</sup> , along with excellent long-term durability under continuous operation. Comprehensive characterization and mechanistic analysis reveal that the enhanced performance originates from interfacial electronic redistribution at the MnCO3/Ni(OH)2 junction. This electronic interaction promotes the stabilization of highly-valent Ni active species and improves electrode wettability, thereby facilitating efficient charge transfer and mass transport. This study underscores the critical role of heterointerface engineering and compositional modulation in developing robust and high-performance UOR electrocatalysts, providing valuable insights for their practical deployment in sustainable hydrogen generation and environmental remediation.

## **1. Introduction**

The accelerating global energy crisis and the alarming levels of environmental pollution caused by the excessive combustion of fossil fuels have intensified the demand for clean and sustainable energy technologies.[\[1\]](#page-11-0) Among various alternatives, hydrogen (H2) has emerged as a promising carbon-neutral energy vector owing to its high gravimetric energy density and environmentally benign combustion by-product—water.[\[2\]](#page-11-0) Electrochemical water splitting is considered a highly efficient and scalable method for green hydrogen production; it involves two halfreactions—namely, the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), which exhibits fast kinetics and proceeds at relatively low overpotentials, and the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), a thermodynamically uphill and kinetically sluggish fourelectron process with a high theoretical potential of 1.23 V versus RHE, which significantly limits the overall energy conversion efficiency.[\[3\]](#page-11-0) This kinetic mismatch results in high energy input requirements and reduced overall system efficiency. To overcome this bottleneck, considerable research has been devoted to developing alternative anodic reactions with more favorable thermodynamics and simpler reaction pathways.[\[4\]](#page-12-0) One such alternative is the electrochemical urea oxidation reaction (UOR), which not only offers a significantly lower theoretical potential of 0.37 V versus RHE but also enables the simultaneous treatment of urea-rich wastewater—a prevalent by-product of agricultural runoff and industrial effluents.[\[5\]](#page-12-0) By substituting OER with UOR, the overall cell voltage for hydrogen production can be reduced by up to 70%, offering a dual benefit of energysaving hydrogen production and environmental remediation through the oxidation of urea to nitrogen and carbon dioxide.[\[6\]](#page-12-0) This dual-functionality is particularly relevant in addressing nitrogen pollution, which is increasingly recognized as a major contributor to eutrophication and groundwater contamination.[\[7\]](#page-12-0)

Despite the favorable thermodynamics of the urea oxidation reaction (UOR), the reaction still suffers from inherently sluggish kinetics due to the complex six-electron transfer process involved in breaking the C─N bond in urea molecules.[\[8\]](#page-12-0) Therefore, the use of high-performance electrocatalysts remains essential to lower the activation energy, accelerate reaction rates, and improve the overall efficiency of hydrogen production in UORassisted electrolysis systems. Noble metal-based catalysts, such as Pt, Ir, and Ru and their oxides, have demonstrated excellent catalytic activity toward UOR owing to their optimal adsorption energies and high electronic conductivity.[\[9\]](#page-12-0) However, their high cost, scarcity, and susceptibility to poisoning by urea or its intermediate species significantly limit their scalability and longterm durability under practical operating conditions.[\[10\]](#page-12-0) These drawbacks have spurred intensive research into identifying costeffective and earth-abundant alternatives. In this context, transi-

tion metal (TM)-based electrocatalysts, particularly those based on Fe, Co, Mn, and Ni, have emerged as promising candidates due to their tunable redox properties, structural versatility, and relatively low cost.[\[11\]](#page-12-0) These materials can undergo reversible oxidation and reduction during electrocatalysis, allowing for dynamic modulation of active sites. In addition, their catalytic activity can be further enhanced by heterostructure formation, defect engineering, or doping strategies that optimize charge transfer and surface adsorption processes.

Among TM-based candidates, nickel-based materials stand out as the most effective and widely studied electrocatalysts for UOR in alkaline media. This is primarily due to their favorable redox transition (Ni2+/Ni3+), which plays a central role in urea activation and oxidation, and their strong chemical stability under alkaline conditions.[\[12\]](#page-12-0) Furthermore, nickel-based hydroxides, oxides, phosphides, and sulfides have shown remarkable UOR performance and can be synthesized via scalable and low-cost methods. Nevertheless, two critical challenges persist that hinder the practical application of nickel-based UOR catalysts: (i) Selectivity issues, wherein over-oxidation of urea leads to undesirable by-products such as NO2 <sup>−</sup> and NO3 instead of the desired inert N2, compromising energy efficiency and introducing environmental hazards;[\[13\]](#page-12-0) and (ii) structural instability, particularly of the active NiOOH phase, which tends to undergo surface passivation or degradation under prolonged electrolysis, resulting in a gradual decline in current density over time.[\[14\]](#page-12-0) To overcome these limitations, researchers have focused on rational catalyst design strategies that combine nickel with secondary transition metals or functional supports to modulate the local electronic structure, stabilize high-valent Ni species, and enhance mass and charge transport properties.[\[15\]](#page-12-0) One promising strategy is the construction of heterostructured interfaces, where synergistic interactions between two or more components can lead to electronic redistribution, improved reactant adsorption, and enhanced electrocatalytic durability.

Herein, we report the design and in situ fabrication of a MnCO3/Ni(OH)2 heterostructured nanoflower array directly grown on conductive carbon cloth (CC) for highly efficient and stable UOR. The unique nanostructure features interconnected petals that maximize electrochemically active surface area, while the engineered heterointerface between MnCO3 and Ni(OH)2 promotes favorable electronic redistribution. The resulting catalyst exhibits outstanding UOR performance, delivering ultralow overpotentials of 90 mV at 10 mA·cm−<sup>2</sup> and 167 mV at 200 mA·cm−<sup>2</sup> , along with excellent long-term durability (>94.5% current retention over 45 h of continuous operation). Mechanistic investigations via XPS, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and in situ Raman spectroscopy reveal that the MnCO3/Ni(OH)2 heterointerface facilitates the generation and stabilization of high-valent Ni3+/Ni4<sup>+</sup> active sites, which are crucial for UOR. Moreover, the improved surface hydrophilicity enhances reactant accessibility and product desorption, further contributing to the exceptional catalytic performance. This work demonstrates the power of interfacial engineering and compositional modulation in overcoming the key challenges associated with Ni-based UOR electrocatalysts and provides valuable insights for the development of next-generation energy-efficient and environmentally sustainable electrochemical systems.

## **2. Results and Discussion**

#### **2.1. Structural, Morphological, and Electronic Characterization of MnCO3/Ni(OH)2@CC**

The MnCO3/Ni(OH)2@CC composite was synthesized via a sequential hydrothermal method followed by a controlled calcination under a H2/Ar atmosphere, as schematically illustrated in Figure [1a.](#page-2-0) Equimolar aqueous solutions of manganese(II) nitrate tetrahydrate and nickel(II) nitrate hexahydrate were used to impregnate carbon cloth, which was then subjected to hydrothermal treatment at 120 °C for 10 h. Subsequent calcination at 300 °C under reductive atmosphere promoted the formation of the heterostructured MnCO3/Ni(OH)2 nanoflower array directly on the carbon substrate, enabling strong interfacial integration. The crystalline structure, morphology, and electronic properties of the MnCO3/Ni(OH)2@CC electrocatalyst were comprehensively investigated to elucidate the formation and synergistic integration of its constituent phases.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis (Figure [1b](#page-2-0) and Figure S1) confirms the presence of both rhombohedral MnCO3 (JCPDS no. 44-1472) and hexagonal Ni(OH)2 (JCPDS no. 73-1520) phases along with characteristic reflections of the carbon cloth substrate.[\[16\]](#page-12-0) Diffraction peaks at 31.5 °, 37.7 °, 41.6 °, 45.4 °, 51.7 °, and 51.9 ° correspond to MnCO3 crystal planes (104), (110), (113), (202), (108), and (116), while peaks at 19.2 °, 33.2 °, 38.8 °, and 52.9 ° match Ni(OH)2 planes (001), (100), (011), and (012). Additionally, the powder sample labeled S1, obtained by centrifugation of the precipitated bottom fraction during synthesis, exhibits a similar XRD pattern, further confirming the coexistence and phase purity of MnCO3 and Ni(OH)2 in the composite material. Phasepure MnCO3@CC and Ni(OH)2@CC reference samples (Figures S2 and S3) validate the selective formation of each component and preservation of the substrate. The critical selection of H2/Ar mixed gas as the calcination atmosphere stems from its reducing properties. In contrast, thermal treatment under inert N2 conditions leads to high-temperature decomposition of the precursor, yielding Mn3O4 and NiO phases (Figure S4). This atmospheric dependency highlights the necessity of reductive environments for preserving target carbonate/hydroxide structures during calcination.

Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy (Figure [1c\)](#page-2-0) provides complementary chemical insights. The characteristic FTIR absorption bands at 2850, 1600, 1350, and 1100 cm−<sup>1</sup> correspond to the stretching vibrations of C─H, C═C, C═O, and C─C bonds inherent to the carbon cloth substrate, respectively.[\[17\]](#page-12-0) The retention of these spectral features across all samples confirms the structural integrity of the carbon cloth backbone, indicating that the synthetic modifications selectively introduced active phases without compromising the substrate framework. In the Ni(OH)2@CC composite, a prominent absorption peak at 3600 cm−<sup>1</sup> is assigned to O─H stretching vibrations of hydrogen-

bonded hydroxyl groups within the nickel hydroxide matrix, while the broad band spanning 2901–3736 cm−<sup>1</sup> arises from O─H stretching vibrations of physically adsorbed water molecules on the composite surface. Additionally, the distinct peak at 620 cm−<sup>1</sup> corresponds to Ni─OH bending vibrations, confirming the presence of structurally integrated hydroxide species in the Ni(OH)2 phase.[\[18\]](#page-12-0) In MnCO3-modified carbon cloth, characteristic peaks at 1792 and 726 cm−<sup>1</sup> are attributed to the C═O stretching vibrations of anionic carbonate groups and Mn─O stretching vibrations within the manganese carbonate phase, respectively.[\[19\]](#page-12-0) The MnCO3/Ni(OH)2@CC electrocatalyst simultaneously exhibits the absorption features of both MnCO3 and Ni(OH)2, confirming their successful codeposition and intimate electronic coupling on the carbon cloth substrate.

Morphological characterization via scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Figure [2a–c\)](#page-3-0) reveals that the initially smooth carbon cloth substrate is uniformly coated with densely packed nanoflower-like arrays composed of MnCO3–Ni(OH)2 composite nanoflakes. These hierarchical nanostructures exhibit pronounced surface roughness and increased surface area at the nanoscale, generating abundant catalytic active sites that are essential for enhanced electrochemical performance. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images (Figure [2d\)](#page-3-0) corroborate the SEM observations, and at higher magnifications (inset Figure [2d\)](#page-3-0), clearly resolve the distinct interface between Ni(OH)2 and MnCO3 phases. High-resolution TEM (HRTEM) analysis (Figure [2e](#page-3-0) and Figures S5–S6) identifies lattice fringes with interplanar spacings of 0.269 and 0.200 nm, corresponding respectively to the (100) plane of Ni(OH)2 and the (202) plane of MnCO3, confirming the epitaxial growth and intimate heterostructural integration of the two components.[\[20\]](#page-12-0) Selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns (Figure [2f\)](#page-3-0) further substantiate the polycrystalline nature of the MnCO3/Ni(OH)2@CC heterostructure, with diffraction rings characteristic of both MnCO3 and Ni(OH)2 phases, consistent with the HRTEM observations. Moreover, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mapping (Figure [2g\)](#page-3-0) demonstrates a homogeneous spatial distribution 1861471x, 2025, 21, Downloaded from https://aces.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asia.202500828 by University Of Science, Wiley Online Library on [06/01/2026].

of Ni, Mn, O, and C throughout the heterostructure, confirming the uniform integration of MnCO3 and Ni(OH)2 phases at the nanoscale. This uniform elemental dispersion facilitates effective electronic coupling and charge transfer between the catalytic sites and the conductive carbon cloth substrate, which is critical for the observed enhanced catalytic activity.

Building upon the morphological and structural insights, xray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was employed to elucidate the chemical states and interfacial electronic interactions among the constituent elements in the MnCO3/Ni(OH)2@CC electrocatalyst. The survey spectrum (Figure S7) displays distinct signals corresponding to Ni 2p, Mn 2p, O 1 s, and C 1 s orbitals, affirming the coexistence of Ni(OH)2, MnCO3, and the carbon cloth substrate within the hybrid structure. High-resolution Ni 2p spectra (Figure [3a\)](#page-4-0) for the Ni(OH)2@CC sample reveal multiple oxidation states. The peaks at 852.5 eV (Ni 2p3/2) and 870.2 eV (Ni 2p1/2), accompanied by satellite features, are indicative of metallic Ni0 species. The dominant peaks at 855.9 and 873.6 eV correspond to Ni2+, while additional peaks at 857.4 and 875.1 eV suggest the partial presence of Ni<sup>3</sup>+, implying dynamic redox behavior under electrochemical conditions.[\[21\]](#page-12-0) Although the peak area ratios between Ni 2p3/2 and Ni 2p1/2 show slight inconsistencies due to multiplet splitting and satellite effects—common in Ni-based compounds—this does not affect the reliability of oxidation state assignments. Furthermore, the 1.5 eV binding energy separation between Ni2<sup>+</sup> and Ni3<sup>+</sup> highlights the moderate electronic interaction between these states, which is crucial for promoting redox transitions during catalysis.[\[22\]](#page-12-0) Similarly, the Mn 2p spectrum of MnCO3@CC (Figure S8a) exhibits peaks at 641.5 and 643.0 eV, attributed to Mn<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> and Mn<sup>3</sup><sup>+</sup> species, respectively. The presence of these mixed oxidation states is a result of partial surface oxidation of MnCO3 during synthesis and is beneficial for generating unsaturated coordination environments that enhance catalytic reactivity. The binding energy separation of 1.5 eV between Mn<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> and Mn<sup>3</sup><sup>+</sup> further confirms electronic interactions between manganese species that facilitate redox cycling.

Upon heterostructure formation, significant electronic redistribution is observed. In the MnCO3/Ni(OH)2@CC sample, the Ni 2p3/2 peak shifts toward higher binding energy relative to Ni(OH)2@CC, indicating a decrease in electron density around Ni2<sup>+</sup> due to electron withdrawal by the adjacent MnCO3 phase. This is complemented by a corresponding negative shift in the Mn 2p3/2 peak (641.9 eV), suggesting electron donation from Mn to Ni sites (Figure [3b\)](#page-4-0). Notably, the emergence of a peak at 638.2 eV (Mn 2p3/2) in MnCO3/Ni(OH)2@CC confirms the

<span id="page-4-0"></span>**Figure 3.** XPS spectra of MnCO3/Ni(OH)2@CC (a) Ni 2p, (b) Mn 2p, (c) O 1 s, and (d) C 1 s.

presence of metallic Mn<sup>0</sup> species, indicative of localized electron accumulation and the formation of electron-rich domains at the heterointerface. This bidirectional electron transfer between MnCO3 and Ni(OH)2 facilitates modulation of their respective dband centers, enhancing the binding energies of intermediates and lowering the activation barrier for Ni oxidation to highvalence active species. This interfacial charge redistribution accelerates electron transport across the catalyst and substrate interface, thereby boosting the overall kinetics of the UOR. Further evidence is provided by the C 1 s spectrum (Figure 3c), which displays three major components: a peak at 284.7 eV corresponding to C─C bonds in the carbon cloth, a shoulder at 286.07 eV attributed to C─O functionalities, and a peak at 288.2 eV assigned to carbonate (CO3 <sup>2</sup>−) species originating from MnCO3. The O 1 s spectrum (Figure 3d) reveals three distinct environments with binding energies at 529.5, 531.2, and 533.6 eV, corresponding to lattice M─O bonds (M <sup>=</sup> Mn/Ni), M─OH species at the heterointerface, and C═O groups within the carbon matrix, respectively.

Collectively, these spectroscopic findings confirm the successful synthesis of MnCO3/Ni(OH)2 hybrid nanoflowers in situ on conductive carbon cloth, forming a well-integrated heterointerface that promotes efficient electron transport and favorable catalytic site activation. The hierarchical nanoarchitecture and intimate electronic coupling between MnCO3 and Ni(OH)2 synergistically optimize charge transfer and active site accessibility, laying a strong foundation for enhanced electrochemical performance in UOR applications.

#### **2.2. Electrochemical Urea Oxidation Activity Evaluation**

Building upon the structural and electronic characterizations that confirmed the successful synthesis and interfacial integration of MnCO3 and Ni(OH)2 within the hierarchical nanoflower array, the electrocatalytic performance of MnCO3/Ni(OH)2@CC was systematically assessed for the UOR. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) measurements were performed using a conventional

three-electrode setup in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte with and without 0.5 M urea to elucidate the catalyst urea oxidation activity. As illustrated in Figure 4a, the MnCO3/Ni(OH)2@CC catalyst demonstrates a significant enhancement in electrochemical performance under urea-containing conditions, delivering a current density of 100 mA·cm−<sup>2</sup> at a notably low potential of 1.37 V versus RHE. In contrast, a potential of 1.61 V is required to drive the same current density for the OER in urea-free 1.0 M KOH. This substantial 240 mV reduction in required potential highlights the energy-saving advantage of UOR over OER, thereby enhancing the overall efficiency of hydrogen production via urea-assisted electrolysis. The comparative UOR activity of various control samples is presented in Figure 4b, where MnCO3/Ni(OH)2@CC outperforms its individual components— Ni(OH)2@CC and MnCO3@CC—as well as the bare carbon cloth (CC) substrate. Specifically, MnCO3/Ni(OH)2@CC achieves ultralow overpotentials of 90 and 167 mV at current densities of 10 and 200 mA·cm−<sup>2</sup> , respectively. These values are significantly lower than those of Ni(OH)2@CC, which requires 156 and 272 mV for the same current densities. In contrast, MnCO3@CC and bare CC exhibit negligible activity, underscoring the synergistic advantage conferred by the heterostructure. The electrochemical performance metrics exhibit significant advantages over previously reported Ni-based catalysts (Table S1). Moreover, Figure S9 confirms the superior OER activity of MnCO3/Ni(OH)2@CC compared to its monometallic counterparts, further demonstrating its bifunctionality.

To gain mechanistic insight, cyclic voltammetry (CV) was conducted in 1.0 M KOH to probe the redox behavior of the catalysts (Figure 4c). A prominent redox couple centered

around 1.15–1.50 V versus RHE, corresponding to the Ni<sup>2</sup>+/Ni3<sup>+</sup> transition, was observed for all nickel-based catalysts. However, MnCO3/Ni(OH)2@CC exhibited a more cathodic onset potential and a markedly higher anodic peak current than Ni(OH)2@CC. This behavior is indicative of facilitated Ni<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> oxidation, attributed to the electronic coupling between MnCO3 and Ni(OH)2. MnCO3 likely acts as an electron acceptor, stabilizing high-valent Ni3<sup>+</sup> species through interfacial electronic redistribution and orbital hybridization. The increased abundance of Ni3<sup>+</sup> species—known to serve as active sites for UOR—accounts for the enhanced mass-specific activity of the heterostructured catalyst. Furthermore, this modulation of the electronic environment favors improved adsorption and activation of urea molecules, thereby promoting the overall electrooxidation process.

To evaluate the reaction kinetics, Tafel slope analysis was performed using the LSV data (Figure [4d\)](#page-5-0). The MnCO3/Ni(OH)2@CC heterostructure exhibits the lowest Tafel slope of 45.3 mV·dec−<sup>1</sup> signifying superior catalytic kinetics compared to Ni(OH)2@CC (93 mV·dec−<sup>1</sup> ), MnCO3@CC (318 mV·dec−<sup>1</sup> ), and bare CC (339 mV·dec−<sup>1</sup> ). This lower Tafel slope implies a more favorable charge transfer process during the UOR, likely stemming from the coherent heterointerface and optimized d-band center alignment within the MnCO3/Ni(OH)2 system. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) further supports this conclusion. As illustrated in Figure [4e,](#page-5-0) MnCO3/Ni(OH)2@CC displays the smallest charge-transfer resistance (Rct) among all investigated catalysts, highlighting its superior interfacial conductivity and enhanced electron transport efficiency. The consistent trends observed across Tafel analysis and EIS measurements reinforce the beneficial role of the heterostructure in accelerating electrochemical kinetics and reducing energy barriers for the UOR. Collectively, these electrochemical evaluations validate that the MnCO3/Ni(OH)2@CC heterostructure enables efficient urea electro-oxidation through synergistic modulation of electronic structure, redox activity, and interfacial charge transport. This optimized catalytic interface plays a pivotal role in enhancing energy efficiency, making it a promising candidate for practical urea-assisted hydrogen production technologies.

To further elucidate the origin of the enhanced electrocatalytic activity, the electrochemical double-layer capacitance (Cdl) was measured as a proxy for electrochemically active surface area (ECSA). CV was performed at varying scan rates within the non-Faradaic potential window (−0.15 to −0.05 V vs. Ag/AgCl) in 1.0 M KOH and 0.5 M urea electrolyte to calculate Cdl values for MnCO3/Ni(OH)2@CC and comparative samples. As shown in Figures [4f](#page-5-0) and S10, the MnCO3/Ni(OH)2@CC heterostructure exhibits a markedly higher Cdl of 36.9 mF·cm−<sup>2</sup> , significantly surpassing that of Ni(OH)2@CC (3.65 mF·cm−<sup>2</sup> ), MnCO3@CC (4.96 mF·cm−<sup>2</sup> ), and bare carbon cloth (1.76 mF·cm−<sup>2</sup> ). This enhanced capacitance reflects a substantial increase in the number of accessible active sites, which can be attributed to the hierarchical nanoflower morphology and the synergistic interfacial integration of MnCO3 and Ni(OH)2. The intimate heterojunction facilitates more efficient charge accumulation and transfer, while the porous architecture ensures high surface accessibility for reactants. These structural and electronic features jointly contribute to the superior catalytic kinetics and lower overpotential requirements previously discussed. To comprehensively optimize the reaction parameters and further understand structure– activity relationships, systematic investigations were conducted on urea concentration, Ni/Mn precursor molar ratio, and calcination conditions. As summarized in Figure S11, these experimental parameters significantly influence catalytic performance. At urea concentrations below 0.5 M, the OER dominates, as indicated by higher onset potentials (Figure S11a). This observation suggests kinetic limitations due to insufficient surface coverage by urea molecules, impeding effective UOR initiation. However, upon increasing the urea concentration to 0.5 M, a distinct shift in electrochemical behavior is observed, with the UOR becoming thermodynamically and kinetically favorable. Beyond 0.5 M, additional urea does not yield further performance enhancement, implying saturation of active sites and completion of adsorptionlimited steps, particularly the \*CO(NH2)2 intermediate binding. Additionally, the precursor molar ratio of Ni to Mn was found to be critical in achieving optimal catalytic synergy. As shown in Figure S11b, the 1:1 Ni:Mn ratio delivers the best electrocatalytic response, likely due to balanced phase distribution, optimal heterointerface formation, and electronic modulation that promotes active Ni<sup>3</sup><sup>+</sup> species stabilization. Deviations from this stoichiometry disrupt the cooperative effect, either by reducing conductivity (excess Mn) or diminishing redox-active Ni centers (excess Ni). Calcination temperature and duration also exert profound effects on crystallinity and catalytic activity. As evidenced in Figure S11c–d, under-calcination leads to poorly crystalline or amorphous phases with suboptimal catalytic sites, whereas over-calcination promotes grain growth and particle agglomeration, reducing surface area and disrupting heterointerfaces. The selected calcination condition of 300 °C for 2 h under H2/Ar effectively balances these competing effects, yielding a well-defined MnCO3/Ni(OH)2 nanoflower heterostructure with maximized structural integrity and interfacial synergy.

,

In addition to high catalytic activity, operational durability is paramount for electrocatalysts intended for practical urea electrolysis applications. The long-term electrochemical stability of the MnCO3/Ni(OH)2@CC heterostructure was systematically investigated under continuous operation. Chronoamperometric measurements were conducted at a constant potential of 1.37 V (vs. RHE) in 1.0 M KOH containing 0.5 M urea to evaluate its time-dependent performance. As illustrated in Figure [4g,](#page-5-0) the catalyst sustains over 94.5% of its initial current density after 45 h of continuous UOR operation, underscoring its outstanding electrochemical robustness. The slight decline in current density over time can be primarily attributed to gradual urea depletion and electrolyte evaporation rather than irreversible catalyst degradation. Notably, the MnCO3/Ni(OH)2@CC electrode also displays excellent operational endurance under OER conditions for 40 h, further attesting to its structural and electrochemical resilience in dual-function environments. To assess postoperational integrity, the electrocatalyst was subjected to fresh linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) measurements after the 45-h UOR test. As presented in Figure [4h,](#page-5-0) the post-test polarization curve nearly overlaps with the pretest curve, demonstrating near-complete retention of its catalytic activity. Structural and phase stability were further confirmed by postelectrolysis characterization. The

XRD pattern of the spent catalyst (inset of Figure [4h\)](#page-5-0) reveals no discernible shift or broadening in the diffraction peaks associated with MnCO3 and Ni(OH)2, confirming preservation of the crystalline phases. SEM analysis (Figure S12) indicates that the hierarchical nanoflower morphology remains largely intact after prolonged electrolysis, although minor localized deformation and collapse of individual nanosheet subunits are observed. These subtle morphological changes likely account for the marginal activity loss but do not compromise the overall electrode architecture. Importantly, no evidence of carbon corrosion or substrate delamination was detected, confirming that the conductive carbon cloth maintains mechanical integrity and effective electrical contact throughout extended operation.

Collectively, these results demonstrate that the MnCO3/Ni(OH)2@CC heterostructure not only delivers superior electrocatalytic activity due to its interfacial electronic synergy and hierarchical architecture, but also retains structural and functional stability over prolonged electrolysis. This combination of high performance and durability underscores the potential of this heterostructured material as a promising bifunctional electrode for energy-efficient urea-assisted hydrogen production.

#### **2.3. Mechanistic Insights into Urea Oxidation Catalysis**

To elucidate the interfacial charge transfer behavior and kinetic evolution during the UOR, operando electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed under varying applied potentials. Nyquist and Bode plots of MnCO3/Ni(OH)2@CC were recorded in both 1.0 M KOH and 0.5 M urea-containing alkaline electrolyte, as presented in Figure [5.](#page-8-0) In 1.0 M KOH (Figure [5a\)](#page-8-0), the Nyquist plots exhibit a progressive decrease in semicircle diameter as the potential increases from 1.3 to 1.5 V versus RHE, indicative of reduced charge transfer resistance (Rct). This trend is attributed to the activation of Ni(OH)2 species and their gradual phase transformation into conductive NiOOH under anodic polarization. The corresponding Bode plot (Figure [5b\)](#page-8-0) further confirms this behavior, showing a substantial decline in phase angle at low frequencies beyond 1.40 V, which is associated with the onset of the OER and improved electron mobility due to Ni oxidation. This transition reflects a shift from kinetically sluggish Ni(OH)2 to catalytically active and more conductive NiOOH, thereby facilitating OER kinetics. In the presence of 0.5 M urea (Figure [5c\)](#page-8-0), a similar decline in semicircle diameter is observed in the Nyquist plot as the potential increases, with a marked inflection at ∼1.3 V versus RHE, suggesting the onset of UOR. This behavior is corroborated by the Bode phase plot (Figure [5d\)](#page-8-0), where a distinct lowfrequency peak emerges at 1.3 V, indicative of charge transfer processes associated with urea oxidation intermediates. As the potential rises from 1.3 to 1.46 V, both the circuit resistance and phase angle decline sharply, confirming that UOR becomes the dominant electrochemical process within this potential window. Beyond 1.46 V, the impedance response begins to converge with the behavior observed in the OER regime (Figure [5b\)](#page-8-0), suggesting competitive adsorption and reaction kinetics between UOR and OER pathways. Collectively, these operando EIS measurements reveal that the MnCO3/Ni(OH)2 heterostructure facilitates dynamic modulation of interfacial electron transfer properties through potential-dependent electronic restructuring. The MnCO3 phase plays a critical role in regulating the oxidation state of Ni, promoting the formation of high-valent Ni<sup>3</sup>+/Ni4<sup>+</sup> species necessary for UOR while preserving conductive pathways via optimized heterointerface integration. These findings align with the XPS observations (Figure [3a–b\)](#page-4-0) and electrochemical performance trends (Figure [4a–f\)](#page-5-0), affirming that the hierarchical MnCO3/Ni(OH)2 architecture not only enhances intrinsic catalytic activity but also ensures efficient charge transfer under operational conditions.

Furthermore, postelectrolysis XPS characterization was conducted to investigate the evolution of surface chemical states after prolonged urea oxidation operation. As shown in Figure S13a, the MnCO3/Ni(OH)2@CC electrocatalyst exhibits a notable increase in the proportion of high-valent Ni3<sup>+</sup> species, accompanied by a marked decrease in metallic Ni° contributions. This shift in valence state distribution affirms the electrochemical transformation of Ni(OH)2 into catalytically active NiOOH under anodic polarization during UOR. Importantly, the Mn 2p spectrum (Figure S13b), in conjunction with prereaction spectra (Figure [3b\)](#page-4-0), demonstrates minimal changes in the oxidation state of Mn species, indicating that MnCO3 remains largely redoxinert under UOR conditions. This result is consistent with the operando EIS observations (Figure [5\)](#page-8-0), where potential-induced modulation of Ni redox states was identified as the key kinetic driver for enhanced UOR activity. The relatively stable Mn valence state suggests that MnCO3 serves a vital electronic and structural stabilizing function, facilitating the formation and retention of high-valent Ni3<sup>+</sup> species through interfacial electron redistribution, as previously discussed. This synergistic catalytic mechanism, wherein MnCO3 supports and modulates the redox behavior of Ni without undergoing significant oxidation itself, underpins the superior charge transfer characteristics and longterm stability of the MnCO3/Ni(OH)2@CC heterostructure during UOR. The collective evidence thus reaffirms that while Ni-based species act as the primary active sites, the MnCO3 phase plays a crucial auxiliary role in sustaining catalytic performance through electronic interaction and phase stabilization.

Furthermore, the electrocatalytic UOR proceeds through a complex triphase interface involving gas–solid–liquid interactions, wherein the surface wettability and aerophobicity of the electrocatalyst critically influence mass transport and reaction kinetics.[\[23\]](#page-12-0) As demonstrated in Figure [6a,](#page-9-0) contact angle (CA) measurements were performed to systematically evaluate the wetting behavior of the MnCO3/Ni(OH)2@CC electrocatalyst compared to its counterparts. The pristine carbon cloth (CC) substrate exhibits a high-water contact angle of 139.7 °, indicative of its intrinsic hydrophobic character. Upon the deposition of Ni(OH)2, the surface becomes moderately more hydrophilic, with the CA reduced to 121.8 °, attributed to the introduction of hydroxyl-rich functional groups. Notably, the binary MnCO3/Ni(OH)2 hybrid structure results in a dramatic enhancement of hydrophilicity, as evidenced by the water contact angle of 20.8 °, demonstrating the material's superhy-

drophobic nature. This transition arises from the hierarchical nanoarchitecture and synergistic interfacial integration between MnCO3 and Ni(OH)2 phases, which expose a high density of polar sites and active surface terminations that promote effective electrolyte penetration. In contrast, the gas-phase (bubble) contact angle measurements reveal an inverse trend, with values increasing from 116.5° for CC to 142.4° for Ni(OH)2@CC and further to 146.7° for MnCO3/Ni(OH)2@CC, indicating progressively enhanced aerophobicity. This dual modulation of wettability superhydrophilicity toward electrolyte and aerophobicity toward gaseous products—plays a pivotal role in optimizing the electrocatalytic interface. The engineered surface effectively promotes reactant accessibility while simultaneously facilitating the rapid detachment of gas bubbles (e.g., N2 and CO2) generated during UOR, thereby minimizing bubble-induced blockage and ensuring continuous access of urea molecules to active sites. This behavior is consistent with the previously observed enhancement in electrochemical kinetics (Figure [4\)](#page-5-0) and the operando EIS results (Figure 5), which collectively demonstrate reduced charge transfer resistance and accelerated interfacial processes. Thus, the strategic tuning of triphase interface properties via heterostructure formation represents a crucial design principle for maximizing the intrinsic activity and practical durability of electrocatalysts in alkaline urea electrooxidation systems.

To further elucidate the mechanistic pathways of urea oxidation and the role of heterointerfacial synergy, in situ Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was conducted on MnCO3/Ni(OH)2@CC, Ni(OH)2@CC, and MnCO3@CC electrodes under electrochemical operating conditions. This technique provided real-time vibrational evidence of reaction intermediates and enabled direct evaluation of catalytic enhancements conferred by the bimetallic heterostructure. As shown in Figure [6b,](#page-9-0) under open-circuit potential, a broad absorption band spanning 2500–3200 cm−<sup>1</sup> was detected for all catalysts, attributed to overlapping O─H stretching of surface-adsorbed hydroxyls and N─H symmetric stretching of urea molecules. The presence of a distinct C─N stretching vibration at 1478 cm−<sup>1</sup> confirmed effective urea adsorption at the catalytic interface, particularly

<span id="page-9-0"></span>**Figure 6.** (a) Surface wettability characterization of CC, Ni(OH)2@CC, and MnCO3/Ni(OH)2@CC electrocatalysts: liquid-phase contact angles (top) and underwater gas-phase bubble contact angles (bottom), demonstrating hydrophilic and aerophobic modulation.

for MnCO3/Ni(OH)2@CC, owing to its superior hydrophilicity and favorable surface chemistry (consistent with wettability data in Figure 6a). Upon applying an anodic bias of 0.5 V versus Ag/AgCl, the intensity of N─H vibrational bands decreased and exhibited a notable blue shift, indicating progressive oxidation of ─NH2 groups and the onset of urea activation. Simultaneously, attenuation of the C─N stretching band and emergence of a new band at 1720 cm−<sup>1</sup> , corresponding to carboxylcontaining intermediates (COOH\*), provided direct evidence of urea dehydrogenation and C─N bond cleavage—a key step in the UOR mechanism. Notably, these spectral transformations were more prominent and occurred at lower overpotentials for MnCO3/Ni(OH)2@CC relative to the single-component systems, affirming the heterostructure's superior ability to facilitate intermediate conversion via electronic coupling and optimal adsorption energetics. The appearance of a metal ─OOH vibra-

tional feature at ∼1096 cm−<sup>1</sup> , as highlighted in Figure S14, further confirms the formation of oxygen-bridged species (M─OOH), signifying the stabilization of high-valent Ni species essential for the rate-determining steps of urea oxidation to CO2 and N2. This finding aligns with earlier operando EIS and postreaction XPS analyses (Figure [5](#page-8-0) and Figure S13), which highlighted the role of MnCO3 in modulating the electronic structure of the Ni active centers and enhancing the formation and stability of Ni3<sup>+</sup> species under reaction conditions. For comparison, the Ni(OH)2@CC electrode displays similar but less intense spectral features under polarization. At open circuit, the weaker O─H and C─N vibrational signatures (Figure [6b\)](#page-9-0) suggest inferior surface hydrophilicity, resulting in reduced reactant preconcentration at the catalytic interface. Although polarization beyond 0.5 V versus Ag/AgCl triggers spectral changes analogous to the heterostructure, the overall signal intensity and intermediate conversion rate remain significantly lower, indicating sluggish reaction kinetics and less effective electron transfer.

In contrast, the MnCO3@CC electrode exhibits minimal spectral activity under identical conditions. As shown in Figure S15, discernible changes in vibrational features only appear at higher potentials (≥0.6 V vs. Ag/AgCl), and even then, the spectral intensity remains weak throughout the reaction window. This delayed and diminished response reflects the intrinsic catalytic limitations of MnCO3, which lacks redox-active Ni sites necessary for efficient urea electro-oxidation. Collectively, the in situ FTIR findings, in conjunction with Figures [6b,](#page-9-0) S14, and S15, provide compelling evidence for a synergistically enhanced dual-site mechanism in the MnCO3/Ni(OH)2@CC system. The heterostructured interface not only promotes effective urea adsorption and activation via MnCO3 but also facilitates the generation and stabilization of Ni─OOH active species critical for highperformance urea oxidation catalysis.

In situ FTIR spectroscopy further provides compelling mechanistic insight into the complete electro-oxidation of urea over MnCO3/Ni(OH)2@CC electrodes. The observed spectral evolution directly validates the proposed six-electron reaction pathway:

$$CO(NH_2)_2 + 8OH^- \rightarrow CO_3^{2-} + N_2 + 6H_2O + 6e^-$$
 (1)

At elevated potentials, the progressive attenuation and ultimate disappearance of organic vibrational features—including N─H and C─N stretching bands—confirm the full conversion of urea to inorganic end products. The emergence of a strong, well-defined vibrational band assigned to carbonate species (CO3 <sup>2</sup>−) at higher potentials serves as direct spectroscopic evidence for complete mineralization of urea (as supported in Figure S14), reinforcing the reaction pathway's terminal step. Importantly, the MnCO3/Ni(OH)2@CC heterostructure exhibits markedly faster intermediate conversion kinetics compared to both Ni(OH)2@CC and MnCO3@CC, as evidenced by the earlier onset and higher intensity of COOH intermediates and CO3 2− product signals under identical electrochemical conditions. This enhanced reaction progression is a direct consequence of the synergistic electronic interactions between MnCO3 and Ni(OH)2, which modulate the surface electronic structure and facilitate stabilization of high-valence Ni species, crucial for urea activation and oxidation.

Notably, the heterostructured catalyst achieves complete urea electro-oxidation at significantly lower overpotentials relative to its monometallic counterparts (as previously discussed in Figure [4](#page-5-0) and supported by in situ FTIR in Figure [6b\)](#page-9-0), underscoring its superior catalytic efficiency and enhanced pathway selectivity. These findings, consistent with the previously discussed redox modulation and charge transfer acceleration enabled by MnCO3 integration, conclusively demonstrate the role of MnCO3/Ni(OH)2 heterointerfaces in promoting efficient urea decomposition and optimizing multielectron reaction pathways for energy-efficient electrochemical applications.

## **3. Conclusion**

In this study, we have successfully developed a hierarchical MnCO3/Ni(OH)2@CC heterostructured electrocatalyst via a sequential hydrothermal–calcination strategy, enabling in situ growth of intimately interfaced MnCO3 and Ni(OH)2 nanoflakes on conductive carbon cloth. Comprehensive structural and surface analyses confirm the formation of a coherent heterointerface that facilitates substantial electronic redistribution between Mn and Ni centers. This interfacial modulation stabilizes highvalence Ni3<sup>+</sup> species and enhances charge transfer kinetics, as evidenced by XPS and operando EIS measurements. Simultaneously, the unique nanoarchitecture significantly improves surface wettability and aerophobicity, promoting effective electrolyte infiltration and rapid gas product desorption, thereby optimizing triphase reaction kinetics. Electrochemical evaluation reveals that MnCO3/Ni(OH)2@CC exhibits remarkable urea oxidation activity, achieving a current density of 100 mA·cm−<sup>2</sup> at a low potential of 1.37 V versus RHE, with a small Tafel slope (45.3 mV·dec−<sup>1</sup> ) and minimal charge transfer resistance. These metrics significantly outperform the monometallic Ni(OH)2@CC and MnCO3@CC counterparts. In situ FTIR spectroscopy further confirms accelerated intermediate formation and complete urea mineralization to CO3 <sup>2</sup><sup>−</sup> and N2 via a six-electron pathway, enabled by the synergistic interaction of the bimetallic interface. Stability tests demonstrate >94.5% retention of catalytic activity over 45 h of continuous operation, affirming the structural and electrochemical robustness of the heterostructure. Collectively, these findings underscore the dual role of MnCO3 as both an electronic promoter and structural modulator, which enhances the intrinsic activity of Ni-based active sites and facilitates efficient urea oxidation. This work offers critical insights into rational heterointerface design for non-noble-metal-based electrocatalysts and highlights MnCO3/Ni(OH)2@CC as a promising candidate for energy-efficient urea-assisted hydrogen production systems.

## **4. Experimental Section**

#### **4.1. Materials Synthesis**

All reagents were of analytical grade and used without further purification. The MnCO3/Ni(OH)2 heterostructured composite supported on carbon cloth (MnCO3/Ni(OH)2@CC) was prepared via a two-step synthesis involving hydrothermal deposition followed by

<span id="page-11-0"></span>a mild calcination process. As illustrated in Figure [1a,](#page-2-0) equimolar amounts of manganese(II) nitrate tetrahydrate (Mn(NO3)2·4H2O, 0.126 g, 0.001 mol) and nickel(II) nitrate hexahydrate (Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, 0.238 g, 0.001 mol) and urea (CO(NH2)2, 0.240 g, 0.004 mol) were dissolved in 50 mL of deionized water under magnetic stirring to form a homogeneous precursor solution. A precleaned carbon cloth (1 <sup>×</sup> 1 cm2) was immersed in the precursor solution and subjected to ultrasonic treatment for 30 min to ensure uniform dispersion and precursor infiltration. The mixture was then transferred into a 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and maintained at 120 °C for 10 h. After naturally cooling to room temperature, the carbon cloth was retrieved, rinsed thoroughly with deionized water and ethanol, and dried at 60 °C. The resulting product was thermally treated under a reducing H2/Ar atmosphere (5 vol% H2 in Ar) at 300 °C for 2 h using a tubular furnace to form the final MnCO3/Ni(OH)2@CC heterostructure.

To explore compositional effects, a series of samples with varying Mn-to-Ni ratios were synthesized by adjusting the relative concentrations of Mn(NO3)2 and Ni(NO3)2 precursors. For comparison, control samples including MnCO3@CC, Ni(OH)2@CC, and bare carbon cloth were synthesized by introducing only one metal precursor or omitting metal salts entirely while keeping all other synthesis parameters unchanged. Additionally, to obtain the powdered version of the MnCO3/Ni(OH)2 catalyst for characterization independent of the support, the same synthesis procedure was followed without adding carbon cloth.

#### **4.2. Materials Characterization**

The crystallographic structure of the catalysts was investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Bruker D8-AVANCE, Germany) using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å). Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy was performed using a Nicolet iS10 FT-IR spectrometer to identify functional groups and bonding configurations. The surface morphology and microstructure of the catalysts were examined using field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, Zeiss Sigma 300, Germany) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) including high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) imaging on a FEI Talos-S system. Surface elemental composition and oxidation states were analyzed via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, VG ESCALAB Mark II), with binding energies calibrated to the C 1 s peak at 284.8 eV. Wettability of the catalyst surface was assessed through static water contact angle measurements using a Dataphysics OCA20 goniometer under ambient conditions. In-situ structural evolution and reaction intermediates during electrocatalysis were monitored via in-situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) using a Bruker TENSOR II FT-IR spectrometer integrated with a PIKE VeeMAX III variable angle ATR module. A custom ECIR electrochemical cell (Linglu Instruments) was employed, using a platinum wire as the counter electrode and an Ag/AgCl electrode as the reference. The electrolyte consisted of 1.0 M KOH with 0.5 M urea. Spectra were collected under varying applied potentials (0–0.9 V vs. Ag/AgCl) using chronopotentiometry, with the background spectrum recorded at open-circuit voltage (OCV).

#### **4.3. Electrochemical Measurements**

Electrocatalytic measurements were carried out on a CHI 760E electrochemical workstation using a standard three-electrode configuration. The synthesized MnCO3/Ni(OH)2@CC and control electrodes were directly used as the working electrodes. A graphite rod and Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl) electrode served as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively. All reported potentials were converted to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale using the following equation:

$$E_{RHE} = E_{Ag/AgCI} + 0.059 \times pH + 0.197V$$
 (2)

The UOR was evaluated in an electrolyte containing 1.0 M KOH and 0.5 M urea using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) techniques at a scan rate of 5 mV·s−<sup>1</sup> . The geometric area of the electrode was used to normalize the current density. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed at 1.5 V versus RHE in the frequency range from 100 kHz to 0.1 Hz with an AC amplitude of 5 mV to analyze charge transfer characteristics and electrode/electrolyte interface behavior. The results were presented in both Nyquist and Bode plots. Longterm electrocatalytic stability was evaluated by chronoamperometry at a fixed potential corresponding to a current density of 100 mA·cm−2. The electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) was estimated by calculating the double-layer capacitance (Cdl) through CV in the non-Faradaic region. CV curves were recorded at various scan rates (20–120 mV·s−<sup>1</sup> ), and the Cdl values were extracted by plotting the average current density difference (i = ia − ic) at the mid-potential versus scan rate (ʋ), using the following equation:

$$C_{dl} = 1/2\Delta (ia - ic)/\Delta v$$

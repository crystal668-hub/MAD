# Efficient water oxidation using flower-like multiphase nickel hydroxide with Fe doping

Xinyue Zhang, Yanling Qiu, Wenxiu Zhang, Xuqiang Ji\* and Jingquan Liu 10 \*

Ingeniously designing a water-oxidation catalyst with advantages of a large surface area, multicomponent synergy, and optimized electronic structure, especially utilizing a one-step reaction system to achieve these dominant characteristics is pivotal to high-performance electrochemical water splitting. Here, flower-like multiphase nickel hydroxide catalysts doped with Fe (Fe- $\alpha$ , $\beta$ -Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>) are fabricated through a one-pot solvothermal-coordination methodology. The resulting Fe-α,β-Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> presents excellent oxygen production activity. An overpotential of 267 mV is required to drive a current density of 30 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. Fe- $\alpha$ , $\beta$ -Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> achieves stable operation for over 20 h. The considerable OER performance should result from the unique bionic flower structure, large surface area, and Fe-doping as well as the unique phase interfaces between the  $\alpha$ - and  $\beta$ -Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> components. Our study provides a new trial of combining several favorable structural features into one material system that benefits efficient OER catalysis based on earth-abundant Fe and Ni elements.

## Introduction

Excessive dependence on fossil fuels for economic development has triggered serious energy crisis and environmental problems,1-4 motivating intensive research on clean energy technologies. Among them, the electro-driven water decomposition route has attracted abundant attention due to the sustainable supply of pure hydrogen with high energy density via the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at the cathode and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode.<sup>5-8</sup> Nevertheless, the OER course usually greatly restrains water splitting efficiency due to sluggish multiple proton-coupled electron transfer processes that necessitate large overpotentials. To improve the OER rate and decrease related energy requirement, IrO2 and RuO2 nanomaterials were verified as the best-performing OER

catalysts, whereas their scale-up applications are immensely plagued by their scarcity and high-price.9-11 Therefore, exploiting low-cost catalysts toward excellent OER catalysis becomes the focus of intensive research studies.

At present, transition-metal-based materials including oxides, 12-14 phosphides, 15,16 selenides, 17,18 sulfides, metalorganic frameworks, 19,20 layered double hydroxides, 21 and (oxy) hydroxides1,12-24 are extensively studied as alternatives for OER catalysis with advantages of abundant reserves, low prices and good catalytical activities. Thereinto, nickel hydroxide has attracted great attention by virtue of its hydrotalcite-like structure. Associating their layered properties with anion-exchange capacity makes such nanomaterials promising for technical applications in many electrochemical fields. Despite its great potential, the practical deployment of nickel hydroxide in water splitting is severely limited by its insufficient OER activity.<sup>22,25</sup> To enhance intrinsic OER activity for better catalytical performance, Lv et al.26 regulated the local electronic structure of Ni(OH)2 nanosheets by introducing Mn and F alien atoms, and the doping strategy indeed presented impressive effectiveness in enhancing the OER process. Fe3+ partially replacing the Ni2+ in the Ni(OH)2 lattice was also achieved to optimize the electronic state.27 Although the heteroatom-doping method is valid in constructing active catalysts, it is usually achieved by lattice engineering at the atomic scale which is often hard to control. By comparison, morphology design and multicomponent synergy strategies can be easily applied to fabricate excellent electrocatalysts. Zhao and coworkers28 assembled the FeOOH layer over Ni(OH)2 hollow nanorods to achieve strong electron interactions between FeOOH and Ni(OH)2. For geometricstructure establishment, various sophisticated morphologies such as nanosheets,29-31 nanotubes,8,32 nanowires,12,33,34 nanorods, 35-37 nanofibers, 38-40 hollow micro/nanospheres, 17,41 etc. have been achieved to effectively catalyze the OER. Developing unique biomimetic nanostructures with multiple advantages of large surface areas, and multicomponent synergy as well as the optimized electronic structure through heteroatom doping, particularly via a one-step methodology, toward high-efficiency OER catalysis is interesting and significantly essential for commercial applications.42

Here, flower-like multiphase nickel hydroxide doped with Fe (Fe-α,β-Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>) with a great number of active centers and good electronic conductivity was fabricated through a one-step solvothermal-coordination reaction. The multiphase interface between  $\alpha$ - and  $\beta$ -Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> is of great benefit for rapid reaction kinetics. Fe-α,β-Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> exhibits excellent OER electrocatalytic activity. A current density of 30 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> can be realized by applying an overpotential of 267 mV and the Tafel slope is low (66 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>) in the presence of 1 M KOH solution. Fe- $\alpha$ , $\beta$ -Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> also exhibited outstanding durability and stability.

### Results and discussion

The Fe-α,β-Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> catalyst with a unique flower-like bionic morphology was synthesized by a facile one-step hydrothermal reaction as illustrated in Fig. 1a. Briefly, Fe(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>·9H<sub>2</sub>O and NiCl<sub>2</sub>·6H<sub>2</sub>O were dissolved in ethanol and then mixed with an aqueous solution containing NaNO3 and NaF. Subsequently, the obtained mixture was transferred into a Teflon-lined autoclave for the solvothermal reaction at 100 °C for 5 h to afford the expected product, Fe-α,β-Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> (details in the Experimental section). To investigate the morphology and structure of asfabricated Fe- $\alpha$ , $\beta$ -Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were acquired. As shown in Fig. 1b and c, Fe- $\alpha$ , $\beta$ -Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> exhibits a three-dimensional flower-like structure with  $\it ca.~2~\mu m$ in diameter, assembled by thin nanosheets with a lateral size of 300 nm. Clearly, such a flower-like bionic structure can expose more active sites, which greatly benefits high electrocatalytic activity. On the basis of the TEM image (Fig. 1d), it is worth noting that the nanoplatelets of Fe-α,β-Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> are highly transparent, unveiling its ultrathin characteristic. Such an ultrathin feature not only gifts more electrochemical active

sites, but also ensures rich gas and electron diffusion pathways. The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image of Fe-α,β-Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> in Fig. 1e-h presents 0.46 nm and 0.26 nm lattice fringes, corresponding to the (001) lattice plane of β-Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> and the (012) lattice plane of  $\alpha$ -Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>, respectively, which is consistent with XRD results (Fig. 2a). Hexagonal symmetry and crystallized properties were uncovered by the Fourier transform (FFT) mode (Fig. 1i). As evidenced by the energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) element mapping images (Fig. 1j) of Fe-α,β-Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>, Ni, Fe, and O elements are uniformly distributed on the whole structure. According to the mass ratio of Fe to Ni elements from EDX mapping data, and the fact that Ni only exists in Ni(OH)2, the mass percent of Fe in Fe-α,β-Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> can be calculated to be 7.81%.

XRD was utilized to investigate the crystalline phases and compositions of Fe- $\alpha$ , $\beta$ -Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>. As shown in Fig. 2a, the diffraction peaks at 44.5°, 51.8°, and 76.3° can be observed, which correspond to the (111), (200), and (220) planes of the Ni foam (NF) (JCPDS card no. 70-1849). The XRD spectrum of  $Ni(OH)_2$  can be labeled as hexagonal  $\beta$ - $Ni(OH)_2$  (JCPDS card no. 14-0117) with typical diffraction peaks at 19.3°, 33.1°, and 38.5°, which can be indexed to the (001), (100), and (101) planes. 43 In the XRD pattern of Fe- $\alpha$ , $\beta$ -Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>, the characteristic peaks of  $\alpha$ -Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> (JCPDS card no. 38-0715) and β-Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> (JCPDS card no. 14-0117) were all observed. The peaks at  $11.4^{\circ}$ ,  $22.8^{\circ}$ ,  $34.4^{\circ}$ , and 38.8° should correspond to the (003), (006), (012), and (015) crystal faces of α-Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>, respectively. The characteristic peak at  $19.3^{\circ}$  is attributed to the (001) lattice plane of  $\beta$ -Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>. Clearly, there is no XRD signal of Fe, indicative of the successful doping of Fe into the Ni(OH)2 lattice. 44,45 The presence of Fe, Ni, and O elements in the prepared samples is confirmed by the XPS survey spectrum (Fig. 2b). As shown in the high-resolution Ni 2p spectrum (Fig. 2c), the spin-orbit doublets at 854.6 eV correspondto Ni  $2p_{3/2}$  and 872.2 eV to Ni  $2p_{1/2}$  which fully indicates the existence of Ni<sup>2+</sup>, <sup>19</sup> while the spin-orbit doublets at 856.1 eV for Ni  $2p_{3/2}$  and 873.5 eV for Ni  $2p_{1/2}$  are characteristic of Ni<sup>3+</sup> which should be attributed to air oxidation of

catalysts.<sup>36,46</sup> The shake-up satellite (Sat.) peaks can be observed at 860.9 and 878.8 eV.<sup>47-49</sup> As is shown in Fig. 2d, the fitting peaks of Fe 2p at 724.5 and 711.4 eV agree well with Fe  $2p_{1/2}$  and

Fe  $2p_{3/2},$  respectively, which fully proved the existence of  ${\rm Fe}^{3^+,50,51}$ 

The OER process in alkaline solution is a four electronproton coupling reaction for oxygen gases generation which takes place at the catalyst surface. It involves four steps: OH - + \*  $\rightarrow$  HO\*, HO\* + OH<sup>-</sup>  $\rightarrow$  O\* + H<sub>2</sub>O, O\* + OH<sup>-</sup>  $\rightarrow$  HOO\* + e<sup>-</sup>,  $\mathrm{HOO}^* + \mathrm{OH}^- \rightarrow * + \mathrm{O}_2 + \mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}$  where \* is the active site. The thermodynamic kinetics of the OER is critical for a highefficiency water-splitting device, determining the speed of oxygen evolution. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was used to study the OER catalytic performance of Fe-α,β-Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>. The OER activity of RuO2 was also measured for comparison. As illustrated in Fig. 3a, Fe- $\alpha$ , $\beta$ -Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> shows the most prominent OER activity with an overpotential of 267 mV at a current density of 30 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, which is superior to that of Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> ( $\eta_{30} = 350$ mV), NF ( $\eta_{30} = 434$  mV), and RuO<sub>2</sub> ( $\eta_{30} = 380$  mV). The OER activity of Fe- $\alpha$ , $\beta$ -Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> outperforms that of most recently reported electrocatalysts (Table 1). The better catalytic performance for Fe-α,β-Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> than pure nickel hydroxide is attributed to the important role of the Fe dopant in adjusting the electronic structure of nickel hydroxide, thus resulting in the significant enhancement of catalytic activity. From the inset in Fig. 3a, we also find that  $Fe-\alpha,\beta-Ni(OH)_2$  shows impressive electrocatalytic OER performance in 30 wt% KOH with 230 mV overpotential for a current density of 100 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. A Larger alkaline electrolyte concentration is helpful for faster reaction kinetics. Tafel slope is of great significance in evaluating catalytic performance. The lower the Tafel slope, the faster the reaction kinetics. In order to further illuminate the OER reaction kinetics, the Tafel slopes of these catalysts were obtained. The corresponding Tafel slope curves are fitted by the wellknown Tafel equation  $(\eta = b \log j + a)$ , where  $\eta$  is the overpotential, j is the current density and b is the Tafel slope). As shown in Fig. 3b, the Tafel slope of Fe-α,β-Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> is 66 mV  $dec^{-1}$ , which is less than those of Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> (141 mV  $dec^{-1}$ ), RuO<sub>2</sub>

(133 mV  $dec^{-1}$ ), and NF (156 mV  $dec^{-1}$ ); the results show that Fe-α,β-Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> has rapid OER kinetics.

The long-term durability and stability of the electrocatalyst is a critical factor for commercial applications. Fig. 3c shows a multistep chronopotentiometry curve of Fe- $\alpha$ , $\beta$ -Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>. The current density increases from 10 to 42 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> with an increment of 4 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> per 500 seconds. The required potential for each current can be kept stable for 500 seconds. In Fig. 3d, after cyclic voltammetry (CV) cycling of 1000 cycles, Feα,β-Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> shows only a slight attenuation in catalytic current density. When flower-like Fe-α,β-Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> operated for a longterm durability test (Fig. 3e) of 30 h, the catalytic current retained approximately 90% of the beginning current, which proves the good catalytic stability of Fe-α,β-Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>. The chronopotentiometry curve of Fe- $\alpha$ , $\beta$ -Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> at a current density of 30 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> (Fig. 3f) exhibits very small fluctuation, which also verifies the good OER durability of Fe-α,β-Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>.

# **Experimental**

#### **Materials**

Nickel foam was obtained from Kunshan Guangjiayuan New Material Co., Ltd. Ethanol and hydrochloric acid (HCl) were offered by Tianjin Fuyu Fine Chemical Co., Ltd. Ammonium fluoride (NH<sub>4</sub>F) was purchased from Shanghai Wokai Biotechnology Co., Ltd. Potassium hydroxide (KOH, AR), iron ferric nitrate (Fe(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>·9H<sub>2</sub>O), sodium nitrate (NaNO<sub>3</sub>) and nickel chloride hexahydrate (NiCl<sub>2</sub>·6H<sub>2</sub>O) were purchased from Shanghai Aladdin Biochemical Technology Co., Ltd. Analytical grade reagents were used in this experiment without further purification.

#### Synthesis of Fe- $\alpha$ , $\beta$ -Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> on NF

Fe- $\alpha$ , $\beta$ -Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> was synthesized in the presence of NF by a feasible hydrothermal reaction. Firstly, the oxide layer on the surface of NF is removed as follows: NF (2  $\times$  3 cm) was cleaned in 5 wt% HCl with the assistance of ultrasonication for several minutes; the prepared samples were rinsed with deionized water and absolute ethyl alcohol, and then dried at 60 °C.  $NiCl_2 \cdot 6H_2O$  (0.023 g) and  $Fe(NO_3)_3 \cdot 9H_2O$  (0.16 g) were dispersed in ethanol (5 ml), and subsequently mixed with 20 ml aqueous solution containing NaNO<sub>3</sub> (1.7 g) and NH<sub>4</sub>F (0.011 g). The mixtures were kept in a 50 ml Teflon-lined autoclave, maintained at 100 °C for 5 h. Then the samples were collected to be washed in ultrapure water, dried at 60 °C.

#### Structural characterization

A scanning electron microscope (SEM, ZEISS) with 5 kV potential and a transmission electron microscope (TEM, a JEOL2011 microscope) were utilized to characterize the morphology of the obtained materials. The relevant EDS elemental mapping images were gathered on a JEOL JSM-6700F scanning electron microscope at 20 kV voltage. To reveal the unique crystal structure and composition of the synthesized sample, highresolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) analysis was performed. X-ray diffraction (XRD) results were

obtained from an XRD system (D/Max2000, Rigaku, Japan) with Cu-K $\alpha$  radiation ( $\lambda = 1.54056$  Å). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed on a Thermo ESCALAB 250XI analyzer.

#### **Electrochemical measurements**

Electrochemical experiments were performed via a threeelectrode electrochemical measurement system, in an electrochemical workstation (model: CHI 760E). Fe-α,β-Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> on NF is the working electrode, platinum foil is the counter electrode and a Hg/HgO electrode is the reference electrode. The equation: E (RHE) = E (Hg/HgO) + (0.098 + 0.0591 pH) V was used to convert the potential. The polarization curves of the prepared sample and the corresponding Tafel slope diagram were all corrected for iR using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) tests. We applied 5 mV AC voltage accompanied by amplitude in a frequency range from 0.01 Hz to 100 kHz at an open circuit potential to obtain the EIS measurement result. The long-time durability of the prepared samples was evaluated by the chronovoltage method at a fixed current density.

## Conclusions

All in all, the Fe- $\alpha$ , $\beta$ -Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> hybrid with a bionic flower nanostructure, large surface area, and low cost has been successfully constructed and exhibits wonderful electrocatalytic performance and stability towards the OER, and needs 267 mV overpotential to stably drive 30 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> in 1 M KOH solution. Under continuous catalysis for over 20 h Fe-α,β-Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> presents excellent durability. Moreover, the small Tafel slope of the catalyst is 66 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>. The bionic flower structure, interface, and surface engineering could be able to enhance the exposure and reactivity of active species which determined the high OER activity. We believe that this novel design for fabricating a flower-like 3D structural electrocatalyst with excellent electrocatalytic activity via a simple synthesis route based on earthabundant Fe and Ni elements would help us envision promising commercial applications in water decomposition in the near future.

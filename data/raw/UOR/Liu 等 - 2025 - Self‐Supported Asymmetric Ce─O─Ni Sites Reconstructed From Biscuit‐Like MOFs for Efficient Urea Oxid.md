**Designing asymmetric active sites with tailored electronic structures is crucial for improving the sluggish kinetics of the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) in energy conversion systems. Herein, a unique biscuit-like Ce-doped Ni-MOF (Ce**─**Ni**─**BDC) directly grown on nickel foam is synthesized through solvothermal coordination and ion exchange. The self-supported electrode achieves exceptional UOR activity, requiring only 1.408 V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), VRHE) at 100 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2, outperforming undoped Ni-BDC, RuO2, and Pt/C benchmarks. When applied in a time-decoupled Zn-Urea battery, the system delivers a peak power density of 2.32 mW cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> along with hydrogen production.** *Operando* **studies reveal that asymmetric Ce**─**O**─**Ni sites facilitate reconstruction into Ce--NiOOH at potentials 150 mV lower than conventional -NiOOH formation, and the density functional theory calculations demonstrate that Ce3d-O-Ni2p orbital hybridization evaluates d-band center to −1.359 eV, which stabilizes the \*CO intermediate while reducing the energy barrier for \*COOH formation by 0.27 eV. This work provides a facile MOF-derived route to engineer asymmetric metal sites, mechanistic insights into reconstruction dynamics and orbital interactions, and a practical demonstration in renewable energy storage systems.**

## **1. Introduction**

Excessive reliance on fossil fuels has led to severe issues such as energy depletion and environmental pollution, prompting an urgent need for sustainable energy storage solutions.[\[1\]](#page-9-0) Harvesting "green hydrogen" by electrocatalytic water splitting using decentralized or off-peak electricity is a promising and environmentally sustainable energy storage method.[\[2\]](#page-9-0) A remarkable challenge is that the paired anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) often requires higher potentials (*>*1.7 V vs RHE), which accounts for ∼90% of energy losses in conventional electrolyzers.[\[3\]](#page-9-0) Urea oxidation reaction (UOR) (CO(NH2)2 + H2O → N2 + 3H2 + CO2) emerges as a compelling alternative, with a thermodynamic potential of just 0.37 V versus RHE, enabling simultaneous hydrogen production and wastewater purification when integrated into time-decoupled electrochemical systems.[\[4\]](#page-9-0) However, the practical adoption of UOR faces two critical challenges: (i) the sluggish kinetics of multi-step electron-proton transfers, and (ii) the structural instability of

powder-based catalysts at industrial-relevant current densities (*>* 100 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2).

Non-precious transition metal Ni-based materials are widely regarded as highly durable and efficient catalysts for UOR, owing to their abundance of d-electrons and vacant orbitals resulting from the loss of outer-shell electrons.[\[5\]](#page-9-0) The in situ generated NiOOH species on the catalyst precursor during UOR are generally recognized as the crucial active sites.[\[6\]](#page-9-0) However, the formation of NiOOH from the reconstruction of inorganic Ni-based precursors such as NiS, NiSe, and NiOx typically occurs at relatively high potentials, thereby limiting their UOR catalytic efficiency.[[7\]](#page-9-0) In light of this, porous Nibased metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with abundant exposed unsaturated Ni<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> sites and easily-permeable electrolyte in Ni-MOFs might enable facile formation of NiOOH during UOR and serve as high-performance UOR electrocatalysts.[\[8\]](#page-9-0) However, although the Ni-MOFs have been widely investigated as efficient OER catalysts, Ni-MOF-based electrocatalysts

for UOR are scarcely reported especially in the form of selfsupported structures.[\[9\]](#page-9-0) The limited electron transport properties in Ni-MOFs still hinder the rapid in situ formation of NiOOH species at lower potentials, while it is necessary to further boost the intrinsic UOR activity of the in situ generated NiOOH.

The incorporation of a secondary metal could promote electron transfer in Ni-MOFs and accelerate NiOOH generation during UOR.[\[10\]](#page-9-0) In particular, Ce with partially filled 4f orbitals has been demonstrated to serve as an electron reservoir through its flexible Ce3<sup>+</sup>/Ce4<sup>+</sup> redox transitions, thereby enhancing the catalytic activity of the host by facilitating electron transfer processes.[\[11\]](#page-9-0) For example, Ce has served as an effective vacancy-inducing dopant in Ce-doped Ni3N nanosheets on carbon cloth, which significantly lowers OER operating potential to 1.31 V at a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2. [\[12\]](#page-9-0) Ce in the CeO2@CoSe2 interfacial structure facilitates the transport of OH<sup>−</sup> ions to CoSe2, thereby accelerating the in situ formation of CoOOH and improving OER activity.[\[13\]](#page-9-0) Considering these findings, doping Ce into self-supported Ni-MOFs would facilitate the rapid formation of active Ce-doped NiOOH at a lower potential and generate high active Ce─O─Ni sites for UOR, but these still remain largely unexplored.

In the present work, an asymmetric Ce─O─Ni site strategy was developed to construct high-performance, self-supported electrocatalysts for UOR. Specifically, Ce3<sup>+</sup>/Ce4<sup>+</sup> was doped into a biscuit-like Ni-benzene-1,4-dicarboxylic acid metal-organic framework on nickel foam (NF) (denoted as Ce─Ni─BDC@NF) (**Figure 1**). The incorporation of Ce<sup>3</sup><sup>+</sup> into the fluffy biscuitlike Ni-BDC architecture led to the formation of asymmetric Ce─O─Ni sites in Ce─Ni─BDC@NF. As a self-supported anode, Ce─Ni─BDC@NF exhibited superior UOR performance, requiring an overpotential of only 1.408 V (vs RHE) to achieve a current density of 100 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2, outperforming both pristine Ni-BDC@NF and commercial RuO2 and Pt/C catalysts. The selfsupported Ce─Ni─BDC@NF electrode also demonstrated efficient UOR performance in a time-decoupled Zn-Urea battery with a power density of 2.32 mW cm<sup>−</sup>2, along with the production of pure hydrogen. The Ce─O─Ni sites in Ce─Ni─BDC@NF faciliated the in situ reconstruction formation of Ce--NiOOH at lower potential than of Ni-BDC@NF to -NiOOH. The d-p orbital hybridization of Ce─O─Ni sites in Ce--NiOOH also elevated its d-band center to ≈-1.359 eV, more positive than - NiOOH. As a result, the UOR rate-determining step (RDS) energy barrier of \*CO → \*COOH on Ce--NiOOH with Ce─O─Ni sites was ≈0.27 eV lower than that on un-doped -NiOOH,

contributing to the high UOR electrocatalytic performance of Ce─Ni─BDC@NF.

### **2. Results and Discussion**

#### **2.1. Morphology and structure of Ce**─**Ni**─**BDC@NF**

The Ce─Ni─BDC@NF was synthesized via sequential coordination and ion exchange to form a self-supported structure (**Figure 2**a). In the synthesis, the Ni-BDC was first grown on NF by solvothermal coordination using Ni<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> and BDC as raw materials (See details in Experimental Section). The prepared Ni-BDC nanosheets with uniformly Ni, C, and O distribution on the Ni foam exhibited a fluffy, biscuit-like morphology with abundant interlayers of ≈25 nm (Figure 2b,c; Figures S1a,b and S2, Supporting Information). These interlayers were favorable for the infiltration and ion exchange of Ce3<sup>+</sup> in Ni-BDC@NF. After Ni-BDC@NF soaked in Ce(NO3)3 solution underwent a solvothermal process, the ion exchange between Ce3<sup>+</sup> and Ni<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> led to the formation of Ce─Ni─BDC@NF. The as-synthesized Ce─Ni─BDC@NF retained the original biscuit-like structure on the Ni foam substrate (Figure 2d,e; Figure S1c,d, Supporting

Information). High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) clearly resolved well-ordered lattice fringes corresponding to the (020) facet of Ce─Ni─BDC with an interplanar spacing of 3.55 Å (Figure [2f,g\)](#page-2-0). The uniform contrast degree indicated the absence of larger CeO2 particles. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mapping further confirmed the even distribution of Ni, O, and Ce elements across the whole structure (Figure [2h\)](#page-2-0). The prepared Ni-BDC and Ce─Ni─BDC series samples mechanically detached from the NF substrate, were observed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectroscopy (**Figure 3**a,b). The XRD pattern of Ni-BDC revealed diffraction peaks at 9.42°, 11.99°, 12.44°, 15.77°, 18.47°, 18.83°, 23.95°, 28.33° and 29.30°, which matched well with the (100), (010), (1-10), (10-1), (2-10), (200), (020), (-121) and (12-1) planes of the reported Ni-BDC crystalline structures.[\[14\]](#page-9-0) After doping Ce3<sup>+</sup>, the XRD peak corresponding to the (100) plane of Ce─Ni─BDC exhibited a clear shift to 9.02°, compared to 9.42° of Ni-BDC. In addition, the XRD pattern exhibited a systematic shift of several diffraction peaks toward lower 2 angles, indicative of lattice expansion upon Ce incorporation. Meanwhile, no reflections corresponding to CeO2 or other Ce-based crystalline phases were observed, confirming that Ce3<sup>+</sup> was successfully incorporated into the Ni-BDC framework rather than forming separate oxide phases. Raman spectra of Ni─BDC and Ce─Ni─BDC exhibited characteristic peaks at 816, 864, and 892 cm<sup>−</sup>1, attributing to the C─H out-of-plane bending vibrations of benzene rings. An enhanced Raman signal at 633 cm<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> was observed in Ce─Ni─BDC, which might be associated with local structural distortion induced by Ce incorporation and the possible formation of Ce─O─Ni sites.[\[13,15\]](#page-9-0)

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was conducted to characterize the valence states and electronic structures of elements. The XPS survey spectra confirmed the existence of C, O, and Ni in Ni-BDC and an additional Ce element in Ce─Ni─BDC (Figure S3, Supporting Information). The corresponding atomic

percentages were determined as 53.41 at.% for C, 35.40 at.% for O, 10.05 at.% for Ni, and 1.14 at.% for Ce, further evidencing the successful doping of Ce. Another independent batch of Ce─Ni─BDC@NF was synthesized under identical conditions, in which XPS analysis gave atomic percentages of 53.93 at.% for C, 34.67 at.% for O, 9.94 at.% for Ni, and 1.46 at.% for Ce. These results indicated the consistent elemental composition across batches. Regarding the O 1s spectra, the characteristic peaks of M─O, M─OH, and H2Oad in Ce─Ni─BDC were observed at 531.3, 531.8, and 533.2 eV, respectively (Figure [3c\)](#page-3-0).[\[16\]](#page-9-0) Compared to Ni-BDC, the observed 0.64 eV negative shift of the O 1s peak and the significant enhancement of the Ni─O peak together indicated the formation of asymmetric Ce─O─Ni sites.[\[17\]](#page-9-0) Owing to the lower electronegativity of Ce, the formation of Ce─O or Ce─OH contributed to the negative shift in the O 1s XPS signals. In the Ni 2p spectra, the Ni 2p3/2 XPS peak located at ≈856 eV indicated a Ni<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> valence state in both Ni-BDC and Ce─Ni─BDC. It could be clearly observed that the XPS signal exhibited a shift from 856.96 eV in Ni-BDC to 856.3 eV in Ce─Ni─BDC (Figure [3d\)](#page-3-0).[\[18\]](#page-9-0) This phenomenon was attributed to electron transfer from Ce3<sup>+</sup> sites to Ni<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> sites via bridging oxygen atoms, further highlighting the electronic interaction between Ce and Ni within the structure. In the Ce 3d XPS spectrum, the main characteristic peaks at 903.6, 900.1, 880.8, and 877.5 eV were assigned to Ce3<sup>+</sup> species, while two much smaller peaks at 915.8 and 897.4 eV corresponded to Ce4<sup>+</sup> species, indicating a partial electron transfer from Ce<sup>3</sup><sup>+</sup> to Ni<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> sites (Figure [3e\)](#page-3-0). These observations further confirmed the successful incorporation of Ce3<sup>+</sup> into the Ni-BDC framework and the probable electron transfer on Ce─O─Ni sites.[\[19\]](#page-9-0)

X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) analysis was also performed to investigate the local structure and coordination environment of Ni and Ce in Ce─Ni─BDC. The normalized Ni Kedge X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) data revealed that the Ni K-edge position of Ce─Ni─BDC was slightly lower than that of Ni-BDC, locating between those of Ni foil and NiO (Figure [3f\)](#page-3-0).[\[20\]](#page-9-0) This shift indicated a lower valence state of Ni in Ce─Ni─BDC than Ni-BDC.[\[21\]](#page-9-0) Consistent with the XPS results, it suggested the electron transferring from Ce3<sup>+</sup> to Ni<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> by Ce─O─Ni bridges. Moreover, two white-line (WL) Ce K-edge XANES peaks in Ce─Ni─BDC were located at lower energies when compared with standard CeO2 (IV) (Figure [3g\)](#page-3-0).[\[22\]](#page-9-0) This indicated that Ce in Ce─Ni─BDC predominantly existed in the +3 oxidation state with a minor presence of Ce<sup>4</sup><sup>+</sup>, in agreement with the Ce XPS results.

The detailed atomic coordination environments of Ni and Ce in Ce─Ni─BDC were further elucidated through Fouriertransformed extended X-ray absorption fine structure (FT-EXAFS)spectra.[\[23\]](#page-9-0) As observed in Ni K-edge FT-EXAFS (Figure [3h;](#page-3-0) Figures S4,S5, and Table S1, Supporting Information), two prominent peaks were identified at 1.59 and 2.82 Å in the spectrum of Ce─Ni─BDC, corresponding to Ni─O and Ce─O─Ni affinity, respectively. The Ni─O bond length in Ce─Ni─BDC was longer than that in Ni-BDC (1.56 Å), which could be attributed to the formation of asymmetric Ce─O─Ni sites resulting from Ce doping. Electron transfer from Ce3<sup>+</sup> to Ni<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> lowered the average valence of Ni2<sup>+</sup> and thus weakened the bond strength of Ni─O in Ce─Ni─BDC. A similar increase in bond distance was also observed for the Ce─O─Ni coordination in Ce─Ni─BDC compared to that in Ni-BDC. This suggested the expansive lattice size of Ce─Ni─BDC crystal with doping Ce3<sup>+</sup> in Ni-BDC, consistent with the observed shift to lower angles in the (100) XRD diffraction peaks. The Ce-O bond distance was ≈1.87 Å in the Ce─Ni─BDC spectrum (Figure [3i;](#page-3-0) Figure S6, and Table S2, Supporting Information). It was ≈0.04 Å longer than Ce─O bond distance in standard CeO2 (IV), due to the weaker bond strength of Ce-O in Ce─Ni─BDC. Moreover, the Ni coordination number for Ni─O was calculated to be 6.3 ± 0.5 in Ce─Ni─BDC, higher than 6 in pristine Ni-BDC. The changes in coordination number of Ni further confirmed the successful partial substitution of Ni<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> site with Ce3<sup>+</sup> site and formed the asymmetric Ce─O─Ni sites in Ce─Ni─BDC.

#### **2.2. Electrocatalytic UOR Performance**

The electrocatalytic performance of asymmetric Ce─O─Ni site in Ce─Ni─BDC was initially evaluated using linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) in a 1 M KOH + 0.5 m urea solution. As shown in **Figure 4**[a,](#page-5-0) UOR occurred preferentially in the presence of urea to achieve a current density of 100 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2. Backward scans were employed to minimize interference from the Ni<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup>/Ni<sup>3</sup><sup>+</sup> redox peak. This remarkable negative shift toward lower potentials suggested the efficient UOR performance of Ce─Ni─BDC@NF electrode. Notably, Ce─Ni─BDC@NF exhibited the lowest onset potentials for UOR at 1.261 VRHE (10 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2), 1.327 VRHE (50 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2), and 1.408 VRHE (100 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2), respectively (Figure [4b,c\)](#page-5-0). These potential values were more negative than those obtained on Ni-BDC@NF, demonstrating that doping Ce3<sup>+</sup> into Ni-BDC@NF significantly enhanced UOR activity through the formation of asymmetric Ce─O─Ni site. The UOR overpotentials on Ce─Ni─BDC@NF was also negative than commercial RuO2 and Pt/C electrocatalysts, which bestowed it as one of best UOR elecrocatalysts among other reported advanced materials (Figure [4i;](#page-5-0) Table S3, Supporting Information).

The enhanced UOR kinetics of Ce─Ni─BDC@NF were further confirmed by the Tafel plots. As shown in Figure [4d,](#page-5-0) Ce─Ni─BDC@NF exhibited a Tafel slope of 44.33 mV dec<sup>−</sup>1, which was significantly lower than that of Ni-BDC@NF (73.32 mV dec<sup>−</sup>1). Similarly, Ce─Ni─BDC@NF also revealed a lower interface-exchange impedance than Ni-BDC@NF, confirming by its smaller semicircles in electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) (Figure [4e\)](#page-5-0). In addition, as shown in Figure [4f](#page-5-0) and Figure S7 (Supporting Information), Ce─Ni─BDC@NF exhibited a larger double-layer capacitance (2.25 mF cm<sup>−</sup>2) compared to Ni-BDC@NF (1.43 mF cm<sup>−</sup>2), suggesting an increased electrochemically active surface area (ECSA). The ECSA-normalized LSV curves also demonstrated that Ce─Ni─BDC@NF exhibited a high normalized current density (Figure [4g\)](#page-5-0). This trend was consistent with the original UOR LSV results, confirming the superior intrinsic catalytic performance of Ce─Ni─BDC@NF. These findings further confirmed that the formation of asymmetric Ce─O─Ni site through Ce doping accelerated the charge transfer kinetics and facilitated the electron transportation and exchange during the UOR process, thereby delivering a high intrinsic electrocatalytic activity. In addition, Ce─Ni─BDC@NF exhibited

superior UOR durability during a 20 h continuous stability test (Figure 4h). The catalyst retained its initial biscuit-like morphology after prolonged UOR operation (Figure S8a, Supporting Information). XPS analysis revealed no significant changes in the chemical states of Ce or Ni during the UOR electrolysis test. (Figure S8b, Supporting Information). However, it should be noted that the Ni sites might undergo electrochemical reconstruction during UOR under operating conditions, which would be elaborated in the following section. [24]

#### 2.3. Origin of high UOR performance on Ce-Ni-BDC@NF

The origin of high UOR performance over Ce—Ni—BDC@NF was also investigated. First, the true active components of Ce—Ni—BDC@NF during UOR were examined by in situ Raman spectroscopy and corresponding 2D mapping (Figure 5a-d).

In Ce—Ni—BDC, a characteristic peak at 625 cm<sup>-1</sup> appeared from the open-circuit potential (OCP) below 1.3 V, which was attributed to the bending vibration of the Ce—O—Ni species (Figure 5a,c). A similar Ni—O signal was also observed at 627 cm<sup>-1</sup> for Ni-BDC (Figure 5b,d). The slightly lower vibration energy of Ce-doped Ni—O in Ce—Ni—BDC@NF suggested a weakened Ni—O bond strength due to the formation of Ce—O—Ni sites, agreeing well with XPS and XANES observation results. The slight shift of peak positions compared with the ex situ signals could be ascribed to the different measurement conditions (e.g., voltage and sample preparation).<sup>[25]</sup>

Two new characteristic peaks attributed to Ce- $\gamma$ -NiOOH at 460 and 578 cm<sup>-1</sup> were observed at potentials  $\geq$  1.3 V for Ce—Ni—BDC@NF, together with the disappearance of Ce—O—Ni signals in Ce—Ni—BDC@NF. The remarkable decreased C—H out-of-plane bending vibration signals at 855 cm<sup>-1</sup> in BDC were

also observed at the same time. It indicated the occurrence of in situ reconstruction of Ce─Ni─BDC to Ce--NiOOH at ≥ 1.3 V. In Ni-BDC@NF without Ce doping, the onset foramtion potential of -NiOOH was observed at ≈1.45 V and characterized by the emergence of peaks at 460 and 563 cm<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> together with the disappearance of Ni─O and C─H vibrations at 627 and 855 cm<sup>−</sup>1. This indicated a slower reconstruction process from Ni-BDC to -NiOOH than Ce─Ni─BDC to Ce--NiOOH, consistent with lower UOR potentials on Ce─Ni─BDC@NF. This might be ascribed to the electron transfer from Ce3<sup>+</sup> to Ni<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> via asymmetric Ce─O─Ni site, which decreased the Ni─O bond strength and facilitated the reconstruction formation of Ce--NiOOH. The appearance of Ce- -NiOOH containing asymmetric Ce─O─Ni sites corresponded to higher UOR performance in LSV test, confirming the significant impact of Ce─O─Ni sites. Moreover, the in situ Raman peak corresponding to the symmetric C-N stretching vibration of urea at 1009 cm<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> could be observed from 1.2 to 1.7 V. This confirmed the stable and efficient adsorption and transport of urea molecules on catalysts surface.

To further investigate the role of Ce─Ni─BDC in the formation of asymmetric Ce─O─Ni sites, Ce─Ni─BDC was subjected to carbonization at 450 °C, yielding Ce-doped Ni species (Figure S9a, Supporting Information). Notably, the UOR potential was 86 mV higher than that of the original Ce─Ni─BDC@NF (Figure S9b, Supporting Information), suggesting the superiority of Ce─Ni─BDC in the reconstruction formation of active asymmetric Ce─O─Ni sites. Moreover, a site-blocking experiment was conducted by immersing Ce─Ni─BDC@NF into an EDTA solution (pH 4.5) for 4 h to chelate the accessible Ce and Ni centers. As shown in Figure S10 (Supporting Information), the EDTAtreated electrode exhibited a pronounced decrease in catalytic current density compared with the pristine sample. These results collectively provided compelling evidence that the asymmetric Ce─O─Ni sites were the genuine active sites responsible

for the superior UOR activity.[\[26\]](#page-9-0) Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were also conducted to elucidate the origin of enhanced UOR performance in Ce─Ni─BDC@NF. -NiOOH and Ce--NiOOH as key active species were selected as the corresponding theoretical models (Figure S11, Supporting Information). The projected density of states (PDOS) revealed that the PDOS of -NiOOH near the Fermi level was primarily dominated by the Ni 2p orbitals. On the other hand, the PDOS of Ce--NiOOH in this region arose from the combined contributions of Ni 2p and Ce 3d orbitals. Only a slight overlap between Ni 2p and O 2p orbitals was observed in -NiOOH, while Ce--NiOOH exhibited a significant overlap among Ni 2p, Ce 3d, and O 2p orbitals. The d-p orbital hybridization across the asymmetric Ce─O─Ni site lowered the energy barrier of electron transfer and enhanced the electron delocalization in Ce-- NiOOH. As shown in Figure [5e,f,](#page-6-0) the calculated d-band center of

Ce--NiOOH was ≈-1.359 eV, more positive than that of - NiOOH (−2.647 eV). This shift brought d-band center of Ce-- NiOOH closer to the Fermi level. Differential charge density analysis revealed the charge density of −1.85 |e| for Ce3<sup>+</sup>, 0.59 |e| for O and 0.12 |e| for Ni<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> (Figure [5g;](#page-6-0) Figure S12, Supporting Information). Thus, both theoretical analysis and XPS/XANES results consistently demonstrated the presence of electron transfer from Ce to Ni, corroborating the formation of asymmetric Ce─O─Ni sites. It provided the convenient conditions to promote the electron transfer between asymmetric Ce─O─Ni site in Ce--NiOOH (Figure [5h\)](#page-6-0). As a result, the electron redistribution after doping Ce3<sup>+</sup> into -NiOOH facilitated the enhancement of UOR electro-

catalytic performance. The free energy profiles and corresponding structural configurations for activating UOR on the surfaces of -NiOOH and Ce--NiOOH were systematically investigated (Figure [5i;](#page-6-0) Figures S13 and S14, Supporting Information).[\[5a\]](#page-9-0) UOR on - NiOOH or Ce--NiOOH could be generally divided into a series of key steps. Generally, in the initial step, urea molecules were adsorbed onto the Ni sites by Ni─O-urea coordination bond. (Ni\* + CO(NH2)2 → \*CO(NH2)2). Then \*CO(NH2)2 underwent a stepwise dehydrogenation reaction on the Ni sites (\*CO(NH2)2 → \*CO(NH2NH) → \*CONHNH → \*CONHN → \*CONN). The \*CONN underwent a N-N coupling reaction to give nitrogen as products (\*CON2 → \*CO + N2). Finally, \*CO underwent stepwise desorption on the Ni sites in the presence of OH- (\*CO → \*COOH →\*CO2 → CO2). For the UOR activation on -NiOOH, the rate-determining step (RDS) was the stepwise dehydrogenation process (\*CO(NH2)2 → \*CON2H3) with a high energy barrier of 1.07 eV. After doping Ce<sup>3</sup><sup>+</sup> the stepwise dehydrogenation energy barrier on Ce--NiOOH was lowered to 0.69 eV. When considering the desorption process of \*CO → CO2, it could be found that \*CO → \*COOH was the RDS on Ce--NiOOH with an energy barrier value of 0.80 eV, significantly lower than RDS energy barrier value of 1.07 eV on -NiOOH. It contributed to the faster UOR kinetics on Ce--NiOOH.

#### **2.4. Time-Decoupled Zn-Urea Battery Performance**

Typically, a time-decoupled Zn-Urea battery was constructed using a zinc foil as the anode while the cathode consisted of Ce─Ni─BDC@NF/commercial Pt/C as bifunctional UOR/HER eletrocatalysts (**Figure 6**[a\)](#page-7-0).[\[4c,d,27\]](#page-9-0) During discharging, zinc underwent oxidation at the anode to form Zn<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup>, whereas water was reduced at the cathode to generate pure hydrogen. During charging, the urea in the catholyte was oxidized at the cathode, while Zn<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> ions in the anolyte were reduced and electrodeposited back onto the zinc anode. The Zn-Urea battery efficiency was evidenced by the fact that the open circuit voltage of 1.22 V remained stable for more than 60 min (Figure [6b\)](#page-7-0). The charge and discharge polarization curves further demonstrated the practical applicability of the Zn-Urea battery (Figure [6c\)](#page-7-0). The rechargeability of this Zn-Urea battery was evaluated through constant current charge-discharge profiles (Figure [6d\)](#page-7-0). These measurements were conducted at various discharge current densities ranging from 1 to 9 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2, followed by recharging at a fixed current density of 5 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> after each discharge cycle. Furthermore, the Zn-Urea battery achieved a maximum power density of 2.32 mW cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> (Figure [6e\)](#page-7-0), demonstrating its promising energy output capability.

Long-term operational stability was confirmed by continuous cycling over 150 h at a current density of 5 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> without significant voltage fluctuations, indicating an excellent electrochemical durability (Figure [6f\)](#page-7-0). In addition, the Zn-Urea battery was able to operate stably for more than 24 h at a higher current density of 10 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2, further demonstrating the robustness of the system under high-rate conditions (Figure S15a, Supporting Information). Post-cycling SEM and XPS analyses revealed no obvious changes in morphology or surface chemical states of the electrode, corroborating the structural integrity during prolonged operation (Figure S15b,c, Supporting Information). In contrast, a single Pt/C electrode exhibited markedly inferior stability under identical conditions, underscoring the superiority of the composite design (Figure S16, Supporting Information). Furthermore, when tested in artificial urine, the battery could still operate stably for 50 h, delivering a maximum power density of 0.82 mW cm<sup>−</sup>2(Figure S17, Supporting Information). Nevertheless, a decrease in peak power density was observed, which might be attributed to the electrode surface fouling or side reactions from the complex composition of artificial urine (e.g., creatinine and uric acid). These results highlighted the potentials and challenges of catalyst in practical applications for wastewater treatment and hydrogen production.

### **3. Conclusion**

In summary, we have demonstrated that constructing asymmetric Ce─O─Ni sites in the self-supported Ce─Ni─BDC@NF simultaneously modulated electronic structures and reconstruction pathways to achieve breakthrough UOR performance. By doping Ce3<sup>+</sup> into Ni-BDC to form the asymmetric Ce─O─Ni site, directional electron transfer from Ce3<sup>+</sup> to Ni<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> was facilitated, thereby promoting the reconstruction formation of Ce--NiOOH active species during UOR. The Ce─O─Ni site also elevated the d-band center of in situ formed active Ce--NiOOH, leading to a reduction in the energy barrier of RDS from 1.07 eV on pure - NiOOH to 0.80 eV on Ce--NiOOH. This electronic optimization enables record-low UOR potentials (1.408 V@ 100 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2) and powers Zn-Urea battery to 2.32 mW cm<sup>−</sup>2. These findings establish a generalizable design principle for hybrid organic-inorganic electrodes, with implications for diverse multi-step electrochemical reactions where precise control of active site geometries and electronic states is crucial. This work provides both fundamental insights into d-p orbital hybridization effects and a practical pathway toward sustainable energy-electrochemical systems.

**Exploring single-atom (SA) catalysts in hybrid urea-assisted water electrolysis offers a viable alternative to both Hydrogen (H2) generation and polluted water treatment. However, the unfavorable electronic stabilization, low SA content, intrinsically slow kinetics, and imbalanced adsorption-desorption steps are the bottleneck for its scale-up implementation. Herein, a rare-earth Terbium single atom (TbSA) is topologically stabilized on defect-rich Co3O4 (TbSA@d-Co3O4) by Tb**─**O co-ordination for urea oxidation reaction (UOR) and H2 evolution reaction (HER). Benefitting from the strong TbSA interaction with the d-Co3O4, the TbSA@d-Co3O4 achieves a 10 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> current density at 1.27 V and −35 mV for UOR and HER, respectively. Remarkably, when TbSA@d-Co3O4 is applied as a bi-functional catalyst in a two-electrode system, it merely requires 1.22 V to acquire 10 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> with excellent operational stability for 100 h. The hybrid electrolyzer can be successfully empowered by the triboelectric nanogenerator, AA battery, and solar panel with a nominal potential of 1.5 V. The mechanistic investigation predicts "TbSA" insertion in d-Co3O4 lowered the potential determining step, attributed to balanced reaction energetics for adsorption-desorption of intermediates and favorable charge transfer characteristics for UOR. This work offers a new paradigm to explore the catalytic properties of rare-earth "***f***-block" elements to create advanced electrocatalysts via structural modulation.**

## **1. Introduction**

The decentralized consumption of artificial fertilizers and non-renewable fossil fuels is contributing to a worldwide ecological and economic imbalance. Hence, the development of renewable, economic, and green approaches is highly demanding to cope with the intensive energy demand and pandemic pollution concerns. However, switching from fossil-fuel technology to green renewable hydrogen (H2) energy without harming the ecosphere, required advances in energy storage technology. Electrocatalytic water splitting (WS) to generate H2 by using renewable electricity is a viable and eco-friendly substitute to convert electrical energy into chemical energy.[\[1\]](#page-12-0) Only 4% of the global H2 generation can be coped by electrochemical WS. The sluggish anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with a significant thermodynamic potential (1.22 V) and a high kinetic barrier is acclaimed as the bottleneck in the commercialization of water electrolysis.

The slow O2 production rate at the anodic side and potential explosion of H2/O2 gas, amplify the cost of the water electrolyzer.[\[2\]](#page-12-0) Additionally, the use of scarce freshwater reservoirs as an electrolyte for WS and the poor economic worth of O2 than H2 seems an unrealistic approach to accomplish commercial needs. In this context, substituting sluggish OER with wastewater or biomass resources (devour strong oxidizing propensity) via a hybrid electrocatalytic approach offers a significant direction to circumvent both ecological and energy concerns.[\[3\]](#page-12-0) 80% of globally produced wastewater (≈2200 billion tons) is estimated to be discharged directly into natural waterbodies, which severely contaminate the underground aquifers and cause serious threats to aquatic life.[\[4\]](#page-12-0) Electrochemical urea oxidation reaction (UOR, CON2H4 + 6OH<sup>−</sup> → CO2 + N2 + 5H2O + 6e<sup>−</sup>) is of great significance as it offers a much lower thermodynamic cell potential of 0.37 V than OER and significantly enhances H2 generation by supplying 6e<sup>−</sup> at once. Besides, UOR-based fuel cells have a great energy density (3000 Wh kg<sup>−</sup>1), are cost-free, have natural abundance and environmental benignity that offers a safe route to achieve the two goals in one shot.[\[5\]](#page-12-0) Despite the lower thermodynamic potential, the UOR kinetics suffer from sluggish 6 proton-coupled electron transfer, several adsorption-desorption intermediates, competing OER, and inferior catalyst stability. The adsorption of urea and stability of key intermediates (CO\* and NH\*) is also a substantial factor for selective UOR.[\[6\]](#page-12-0) Though, several developments have been made (CoFeCr-LDH, CoMn/CoMn2O4, 2D CoMn-LDH, CoS2/ MoS2heterostructures, metallic Pt, CoNi3S2, Rh-Co3S4/CoOx), yet there is still much room for UOR activity improvement to the satisfactory level.[\[7\]](#page-12-0) Moreover, a simple catalyst system that possessed UOR assisted H2 evolution reaction (HER) by using the same active bifunctional redox electrocatalyst is quite challenging.[\[8\]](#page-12-0) Considering these facts into account, it is possible to design an efficient bifunctional UOR catalyst for energy-saving H2 generation, but it is still challenging. In the past few decades, transition-metals-based single-atom catalysts (SACs) have gained emerging attention in electrocatalysis, due to maximal exposed active centers, unique electronic configuration, and 100% atom-utilization efficiency. It is reported that strong SA-support interaction due to degenerate d-orbitals results in a spin-orbit coupling that changes the d-band center for selective redox reactions.[\[9\]](#page-12-0) However, the overall catalytic performance of SACs is severely hampered due to isolated atoms and a weak coordination environment that may lead to leaching or agglomeration of SA during electrocatalysis.[\[10\]](#page-12-0) Owing to this concept the rareearth elements (RE) have more degenerate "f" orbitals, which can afford unexpectedly strong coordination bonds with support. The large atomic radii and unique electromagnetic nature of RE, form strong co-ordination with anions on the support, promoting high loading of SA.[\[11\]](#page-12-0) The strong coordination environment is beneficial to immobilize the SA during cyclic catalytic reactions, thus resulting in high durability and extended lifetimes than those of metal-based SACs. Additionally, the delocalization is amplified by overlapping with lighter elements on the substrate (e.g., oxygen), which leads to covalent bonding. Hence, the oxide-based substrate can form a very stable coordination linkage with the RE-based SA. Compared to transition metals, RE-based SACs catalysts have rarely been explored for UOR or other electrocatalytic applications (OER/ HER/ CO2/ N2 reduction reactions).[\[12\]](#page-12-0) The transition metal oxides especially spinel Co3O4 have weak metal-

oxygen bonding that facilitates surface modification via defects modulation (doping or oxygen vacancies), which has been extensively studied in UOR electrocatalysis.[\[13\]](#page-12-0)

Inspired by the aforesaid conversation, we propose an electrophilic RE "Terbium" single atom (TbSA) stabilized on the surface of a defect-rich Co3O4 (denoted as TbSA@d-Co3O4) support as effective UOR. The defect-rich Co3O4 substrate accelerates the water dissociation kinetics along with suppressed OER. The obtained TbSA@d-Co3O4 manifested remarkable UOR performance, requiring an ultralow potential of 1.27 and 1.30 V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode) at 10 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> in alkaline and acidic electrolyte, respectively. The catalytic UOR performance of TbSA@d-Co3O4 surpasses the Pt-C/RuO2 and is the best among all reported catalysts. The TbSA@d-Co3O4 catalysts exhibit superior bifunctional electrocatalytic performance and require −35 mV versus RHE to output the current density of 10 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> for HER in alkaline media. The theoretical investigation further confirmed that the incorporation of "Tb" in d-Co3O4 lowered the energy barrier for UOR. The constructed pH universal TbSA@d-Co3O4 catalyst expresses long-term stability for 200 h (100 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2) and durability toward UOR and HER. The assembled 2-electrode alkaline urea electrolyzer using TbSA@d-Co3O4 as cathode and anode acquired a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> at 1.22 V with exceptional stability for 100 h, standing out as one of top-notch UOR electrocatalysts documented to date. The assembled electrolyzer can be successfully empowered by the triboelectric nanogenerator, commercial battery (1.5 V), and solar panel, highlighting its adaptability across various renewable energy sources. The RE-based SA catalyst offered a new avenue to develop an industrial-scale effective hybrid fuel electrolyzer by green and energy-efficient approaches.

## **2. Result and Discussion**

#### **2.1. Synthesis and Structural Characterization**

The homogeneously isolated RE "Tb" element was stabilized on the pristine and defect-rich Co3O4 nanoplate substrate selfsupported on the Ni-foam. First, the pristine Co3O4 nanoplate was grown on the Ni-foam via hydrothermal reaction followed by an annealing process illustrated in **Scheme [1](#page-2-0)**. The platelets-like morphology can be seen in (Figure S1a, Supporting Information) field emission scanning electron microscopic image (FESEM). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of Co3O4 (**Figure 1**[a\)](#page-3-0), have distinct diffraction peaks of the highly crystalline FCC phase of Co3O4 (JCPDS 74–1657) grown on the Ni substrate.[\[14\]](#page-12-0) The correspondingenergy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mapping in Figure S2 (Supporting Information) further confirms the presence of respective elements without any impurity. The defects in the pristine Co3O4 nanoplate have been induced by quenching with the NaBH4 to obtain a d-Co3O4. The morphology and crystallinity of the Co3O4 FCC phase still endured after the etching (Figure S1b, Supporting Information). The lattice distortion in the pristine Co3O4 has been created as a result of quenching indicated in the shift of the [311] plane in Figure [1a.](#page-3-0) [\[15\]](#page-12-0) The Co3O4 and d-Co3O4 were dipped in the "Tb" solution, followed by air annealing at 250 °C to stabilize the "Tb" at the substrate. The morphology as well as the lattice parameters of Co3O4 and d-Co3O4 persisted after "Tb" insertion. However, the [311] plane

was slightly red-shifted than the  $d\text{-}\mathrm{Co_3O_4}$ , denoting the successful insertion of "Tb".[13b] The EDS mapping (Figure S2, Supporting Information) along with inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) analysis further confirmed a higher loading of "Tb" on the d-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (Table S1, Supporting Information). It confirmed that the defect-rich sites at the d-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> surface are favorable for strong coordination and stabilization of a high amount of RE "Tb" element. The bulk and surface elemental analysis confirmed that "Tb" is topologically coordinated at the d-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> substrate. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of Tb<sub>SA</sub>@d-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> confirmed the establishment of defect sites in Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> due to NaBH<sub>4</sub> quenching (dotted area in Figure 1b). The aberration-corrected HRTEM in Figure 1c identifies the existence of isolated "Tb" as bright spots highlighted with blue circles provide visual evidence of Tb<sub>SA</sub> sites. The isolated "Tb" is abundantly stabilized at the defective sites on the d-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>. The existence of "Tb" is further corroborated by the intensity profiles collected on the line scan mapping of lines 1 and 2 (Figures 1d,e; Figure S3, Supporting Information). The HAADF-STEM image and corresponding EDS mapping further confirmed the spatial distribution of "Tb" on the Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>.

#### 2.2. Spectroscopic Characterization

The variation in structural as well as chemical composition after inducing defects followed by doping with RE element was analyzed by X-ray photon spectroscopy (XPS). The wide XPS in Figure S4 (Supporting Information) confirms the existence of basic elements. The high-resolution O1s spectra in Figure 2a show the 3 peaks associated with the defective oxygen species (related

to oxygen vacancies, OD), lattice oxygen species (related to oxygen bound to the metal, O<sub>1</sub>), and hydroxyl oxygen species (related to adsorbed moisture, Hydroxyl-O) at 531.9, 529.7, and 533.8 eV, respectively. The higher O<sub>D</sub>/O<sub>I</sub> ratio of d-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> and Tb<sub>SA</sub>@d-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> than the Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> certifies the construction of abundant oxygen defect sites in the d-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> after NaBH<sub>4</sub> quenching.<sup>[16]</sup> The relative content of Co<sup>3+/</sup>Co<sup>2+</sup> species in the Co 2p XPS spectra (Figure 2b) reduced in d-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> and Tb<sub>SA</sub>@d-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> compared to Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>. The decline in the Co<sup>3+/</sup>Co<sup>2+</sup> ratio indicates a minor decrease in the valance state of surface Co due to quenching as well as interaction with the RE element.[17] The results of electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) provide additional support related to the defect generation in pristine Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> via chemical quenching, followed by RE doping to tailor the electronic structure for specific electrocatalytic redox reactions (Figure S5, Supporting Information). The Tb 3d XPS spectra of Tb<sub>SA</sub>@d-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> in Figure 2c confirms the +3 oxidation state of "Tb".[18] The O 1s and Co 2p XPS spectra of Tb<sub>SA</sub> @Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> were analogous to P-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, whereas, the "Tb" 3d spectra were parallel to Tb<sub>SA</sub>@d-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> as shown in Figure S6 (Supporting Information). To confirm the local coordination of "Tb", the high-resolution "Tb" 4d XPS of Tb<sub>SA</sub> @d-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> was compared with Tb<sub>SA</sub> @Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>. Both of the samples represent a single peak above 150 eV (representing Tb<sup>+3</sup>) and confirm the slight electropositive charge on "Tb" due to interaction with the substrate. In the case of Tb<sub>SA</sub>@d-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>. the peak is further red-shifted to 0.5 eV, due to a decrease in the local electron cloud density of isolated "Tb" as a result of binding with the defective substrate (d-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>) (Figure S7, Supporting Information). [18c] The defects/vacancies in Tb<sub>SA</sub>@d-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> were further probed by synchrotron X-ray absorption spectroscopy. The Co K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES)

spectra for d-Co3O4 and TbSA@d-Co3O4 both display downward shifts within the pre-edge domain in contrast to pristine Co3O4 (Figure [2d\)](#page-4-0). These shifts designate a reduction in average oxidation states of Co due to treatment with NaBH4 solution.[\[16\]](#page-12-0) The local coordination environment of Co was delved by extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) analysis. As depicted in Figure [2e,](#page-4-0) the two peaks located at 1.5 and 2.5 Å were attributed to the closest Co─O bond and the nearest Co─Co bonds in the octahedral sites of spinel Co3O4, respectively. The minor elongation in Co─Co and Co─O bonds in the Co K-edge FT-EXAFS spectra of for d-Co3O4 and TbSA@d-Co3O4 indicates the successful integration of defects via quenching along with "Tb" doping.[\[16,19\]](#page-12-0) The Co-k edge FT analysis and corresponding 3D-Wavelet transform-EXAFS (WT-EXAFS) in Figure S8

(Supporting Information) indicated the distortion in Co3O4 and weaker interaction between Co and O, which further support the XPS and XRD analysis. The localized structural features of "Tb" in TbSA@d-Co3O4 were probed by XAFS analysis in Figure [2f.](#page-4-0) The Tb L3-edge XANES profile of TbSA@d-Co3O4 was significantly located at higher white line intensity than that of terbium oxide, indicating a substantial abundance of vacant valance orbital states.[\[20\]](#page-12-0) Tb L3-edge FT-EXAFS spectra of TbSA@d-Co3O4 depicted in Figure [2g](#page-4-0) aimed to investigate the coordination environment of "Tb". The dominant peak at ≈1.8 Å was attributed to the Tb─O coordination. There was no Tb─Tb coordination peak analyzed at 3.5 Å, strongly confirming the dispersion of isolated "Tb" on the d-Co3O4 substrate and excluding the aggregation of "Tb" particles at the surface.[\[21\]](#page-12-0) WT-EXAFS was used to reinforce the above findings, as a prominent tool for discriminating backscattering atoms and its high resolution in R as well as k space.[\[22\]](#page-12-0) As displayed in Figure [2h](#page-4-0) the strong signal at the Tb─O co-ordination observed in both TbSA@d-Co3O4 and Tb2O3 confirming the existence of Tb─O bonding. The WT-EXAFS signals of TbSA@d-Co3O4 exhibit an obvious distinction from those of Tb2O3, providing additional evidence for the absence of Tb─Tb and the presence of Tb─O bonding.[\[21b\]](#page-12-0) The structural and spectroscopic aspects confirmed the stabilization of isolated "Tb" on the d-Co3O4 substrate via O coordination. This crucial finding was expected to significantly boost the electrocatalytic performance.

#### **2.3. Electrocatalytic UOR Performance**

The electrocatalytic UOR (H2O + CO(NH2)2 → NH3 + CO2) is an ideal substitute for the sluggish OER reaction using the wastewater in the urea fuel cell for green H2 production along with environmental remediation. Encouraged by the low content of *f*block metal (Tb) in SA catalyst having stable coordination with the defect-rich Co3O4 substrate, we first evaluated the electrochemical OER activity of TbSA@d-Co3O4 in alkaline electrolyte (1 m KOH). The Hg/HgO was used as a reference electrode and carefully calibrated in the H2 saturated electrolyte (Figure S9, Supporting Information). As shown in **Figures [3](#page-6-0)**a and S10 (Supporting Information) the linear sweep voltammetery (LSV) polarization curve is shifted to lower potential after adding the 0.5 m urea solution in 1 m KOH. The TbSA@d-Co3O4 required 150 mV lower overpotential for UOR to achieve a current density of 50 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> than the conventional anodic OER in an alkaline medium. The lower anodic potential is proportional to generate the efficient H2 at the cathode. The UOR activity of TbSA@d-Co3O4 is also compared with the TbSA@Co3O4, d-Co3O4, and Co3O4. The TbSA@d-Co3O4 exhibit a superior UOR performance than the TbSA@Co3O4, d-Co3O4, and Co3O4 affirming that the defects in Co3O4 along with the insertion of RE 'Tb' played a synergetic role to enhance the UOR activity. The defect-rich d-Co3O4 with the doping of "TbSA" (TbSA@d-Co3O4) desired a record-low potential of 1.27 V to mount a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2. Surprisingly, the TbSA@d-Co3O4 and TbSA@Co3O4 outperform the state of art RuO2 and Pt/C as shown in Figure [3b.](#page-6-0) The enhanced UOR kinetics could also be confirmed by the determined Tafel plots. As revealed in Figure [3c](#page-6-0) the TbSA@d-Co3O4 has the minimum Tafel slope of 32 mVdec<sup>−</sup>1, against the TbSA@Co3O4 (−35 mVdec<sup>−</sup>1), d-Co3O4 (55 mVdec<sup>−</sup>1), Co3O4 (100 mVdec<sup>−</sup>1), RuO2 (58 mVdec<sup>−</sup>1), and Pt/C (48 mVdec<sup>−</sup>1). The UOR activity of TbSA@d-Co3O4 was initially optimized by varying the loading concentration of "Tb" during the synthesis. The LSV trend in Figures S11a,b (Supporting Information) confirmed that the 8 mg "Tb" solution shows the best UOR activity. Furthermore, the defects in the substrate were optimized for 8 mg Tb@Co3O4 via varying the NaBH4 concentration and etching time to obtain the best activity for UOR as shown in Figures S11c,d (Supporting Information). The LSV results confirmed that grown Co3O4 etched with 4 mm NaBH4 and dipped in 8 mg "Tb" solution for 15 min (denoted as TbSA@d-Co3O4) devour best UOR performance. To clarify the best performance results via 8 mg ml<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> solution of "Tb", the 12 mg ml<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> "Tb" solution doped Tb@d-Co3O4 was examined under high-resolution TEM. The results confirmed that the Tb@d-Co3O4 prepared from the 12 mg ml<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> "Tb" solution exhibits aggregation of a single atom at the surface along with isolated "Tb" atoms. This aggregation results in a nonhomogeneous distribution of rare-earth metal, which tends to decrease the conductivity of the catalyst and alter the surface environment of the electrocatalyst. Furthermore, the ICP results indicate that the TbSA@d-Co3O4 prepared via dipping in 8 mg ml<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> of Tb solution has the maximum saturation of Tb. Upon further increasing the Tb solution concentration the atomic % of metal almost remained unchanged. The Tb is going to aggregate at the surface. The EXAFS spectra elucidated the emergence of the Tb─Tb co-ordination peak. Hence, TbSA@d-Co3O4 prepared with 8 mg "Tb" solution possessed the best activity due to the maximum saturation of a single atom on the substrate (Figure S12, Supporting Information). Similarly, the effect of increasing the quenching time and concentration destroyed d-Co3O4 nanoflakes-like morphology, as shown in the SEM images in Figure S13 (Supporting Information). The optimum defects and the RE single atom both are crucial for the electrocatalytic efficiency of TbSA@d-Co3O4 in terms of enhancing stability and conductivity. All the electrocatalytic measurements were conducted by following the optimized protocols. The TbSA@d-Co3O4 exhibits superior catalytic activity in terms of rare metal mass loading than the commercial RuO2 and Pt/C. The outstanding activity with respect to rare metal loading implicit the role of TbSA sites for improved UOR performance than commercial Pt/Ru (Figures S11e,f, Supporting Information). The electrocatalytic UOR activity trend of all prepared catalysts is followed as TbSA@d-Co3O4 *>* TbSA@Co3O4 *>* d-Co3O4 *>* Co3O4. The activity trend elucidates that the introduction of defects in Co3O4 via etching increases the conductivity of pristine Co3O4 and the "Tb" doping modifies the electronic environment to promote urea adsorption. To get a more comprehensive evaluation of electrocatalyst oxidation activity, the performance was also measured in an acidic solution (0.5 m H2SO4). For the acidic electrolyte, the TbSA@d-Co3O4 was fabricated on the carbon cloth (CC). The structural and morphological analysis of TbSA@d-Co3O4 on CC is displayed in Figure S14 (Supporting Information). The electrocatalytic LSV trend switched toward the lower potential after adding the urea in the acidic medium as shown in Figure [3e.](#page-6-0) It confirmed the promising UOR activity of TbSA@d-Co3O4 over the OER in an acidic medium. The TbSA@d-Co3O4 only required a voltage of 1.27 V versus RHE to gain 10 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> (Figure S15a, Supporting Information). The small lest Tafel slope (29 mVdec<sup>−</sup>1) means higher

exchange current density followed by faster UOR kinetics (Figure S15b, Supporting Information). It seems that Tb<sub>SA</sub>@d-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> exhibited one of the best pH-universal UOR catalysts with a recordlow voltage among the reported UOR catalysts (Figure 3f and Table S2, Supporting Information). The Nyquist plots displayed in Figure \$16 (Supporting Information) also confirm the smallest charge transfer resistance for Tb<sub>SA</sub>@d-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, clarifying the fast charge transfer kinetics during the urea oxidation process. The enhanced electron mobility and minimized recombination losses are essential for efficient charge transfer in catalytic materials. To confirm the improved electron mobility via defects modulation and RE single atom doping on Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> substrate, photoluminescence (PL) and transient photocurrent analysis were done. The decrease in PL intensity generally indicates a minor recombination of charge carriers, signifying the improved charge transfer. The PL intensity decreases in the order of Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, d-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, Tb<sub>SA</sub>@Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, to Tb<sub>SA</sub>@d-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>. It confirmed that the defects and dopant both play a critical role in improving the reaction kinetics in Tb<sub>SA</sub>@d-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>. Conversely, the highest photocur-

rent observed for Tb<sub>SA</sub>@d-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> signifies the enhanced electron transfer phenomenon (Figure \$17a, Supporting Information). The observation of higher photocurrent in Tb<sub>SA</sub> @d-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> is consistent with improved electron transfer. The effective electron transport kinetics, further support the idea of enhanced kinetics for redox reaction (Figure \$17b, Supporting Information). To elucidate the reason for the improved electrochemical activity of Tb<sub>SA</sub>@d-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, the electrochemical surface area (ECSA) of the fabricated samples was assessed by testing the C<sub>dl</sub> in the non-Faradic region. The CV curves in Figure \$18 (Supporting Information) displayed that the currents of Tb<sub>SA</sub>@d-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> are higher than those of its counterpart at constant scan rates, signifying the maximum C<sub>dl</sub> for Tb<sub>SA</sub>@d-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>. These findings highlight that Tb<sub>SA</sub>@d-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> achieves a significantly larger ECSA, indicating enormous exposed active sites relative to analogous materials. This aspect emerged as a critical parameter in boosting the catalytic efficiency during the UOR. The ECSA standardized LSV polarization curves also assured the remarkable intrinsic catalytic activity of Tb<sub>SA</sub>@d-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> toward UOR (Figure S19a,

Supporting Information). The rich SA sites, highest electrocatalytic active surface area (ECSA), and lower charge transfer resistance further signify the fast electron-transfer kinetic in TbSA@d-Co3O4 to boost up UOR. The long-term chronoamperometric test was carried out at 100 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> to further elucidate the electrocatalytic activity of TbSA@d-Co3O4 toward UOR. As expected, the current density was smoothly maintained till 200 h with a retention of 89.5% in an alkaline medium. Whereas, the chronoamperometric analysis at 25 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> for 12 h showed a sustainability of 86%, certifying the incredible stability of TbSA@d-Co3O4 in acidic electrolytes (Figure [3h\)](#page-6-0). The incredible durability of TbSA@d-Co3O4 in the alkaline and acidic electrolyte further proclaims the preservation of active sites along with notable catalytic performance after prolonged testing. (insets in Figure [3h\)](#page-6-0). Besides the excellent activity and stability for UOR, achieving the high selectivity for the complete decomposition of urea into N2 and CO2 without byproduct formation is crucial for environmental safety. The % selectivity analysis for N2 formation at various potentials confirmed that the TbSA@d-Co3O4 achieved an N2 selectivity exceeding 85% (Figure S19b, Supporting Information).

The morphology and electronic structure of TbSA@d-Co3O4 were examined after the UOR stability tests in acidic and alkaline electrolytes. The SEM image and TEM image in Figures S20b,c (Supporting Information) revealed the persistence of the original morphology signifying the substantial operational stability in alkaline medium. The XRD (Figure S20a and XPS Figures S20d–f (Supporting Information) also affirmed the durable nature of TbSA@d-Co3O4. The elemental mapping and ICP analysis showed a negligible metal dissolution in the electrolyte corroborating its potential for practical applications (Figure S20g, Table S1, Supporting Information). The post-stability XRD analysis of TbSA@d-Co3O4 on CC in acidic electrolyte confirms the preservation of the main peaks of Co3O4. However, the morphology of TbSA@d-Co3O4 has been deformed due to a harsh acidic environment as shown in Figure S21 (Supporting Information).

#### **2.4. Mechanistic Study for Enhanced UOR Activity**

The superior electrocatalytic UOR mechanism of TbSA@d-Co3O4 is uncovered by in situ Raman analysis in the potential range of 1.1–1.6 V versus RHE for water and urea oxidation as depicted in **Figure 4**. The schematic illustration, details of the experimental setup, and analysis parameters are explained in the Supplementary Information and Figure S22a (Supporting Information). It is evident from the analysis that the standard peaks for www.advancedsciencenews.com

Tb<sub>SA</sub>@d-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> are retained by increasing the potential during the OER and UOR confirming the enhanced stability of the catalyst due to defect insertion and "Tb" doping. The addition of urea affirmed the faster oxidation kinetics than the OER. This disparity among reaction rates heightened the experimental noise in data for UOR as obvious in Figures 4a,b. A clear peak emerged  $\approx$ 1042 cm<sup>-1</sup> for urea adsorption on the catalyst surface (Figure 4c; Figure \$22b, Supporting Information). The peak is gradually elongated and shifted (symmetric C-N stretching) due to the adsorption of urea on the catalyst surface by increasing the potential from 1.3 to 1.6 V.[23] A vibration band at 1166 cm<sup>-1</sup> started to appear at 1.3 V, referring the HCO<sub>3</sub>- intermediate formed during to urea decomposition. In addition, a faint Raman peak was observed at ≈2110 indicating the formation of CO\* intermediates species (Figure S22c, Supporting Information) during the UOR.[24]

To further elucidate the specific UOR pathways governed by the Tb<sub>SA</sub> @d-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, an in situ fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy study was conducted as shown in Figure S23 (Supporting Information). The FTIR spectra of Tb<sub>SA</sub>@d-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> at various applied voltages exhibit distinct negative and positive peaks, reflecting the dissipation and accumulation of reactants on the catalyst surface at specific potentials. An absorption band at  $v = 2921 \text{ cm}^{-1}$  corresponds to the N-H stretching vibration of \*N=NH<sub>2</sub>+. The vibration peak at  $v = 2168 \text{ cm}^{-1}$  is attributed to \*C-NO<sup>-</sup> intermediate. The pronounced increase in the vibrational peak of \*C-NO<sup>-</sup> intermediate with increasing potential, indicates the fast reaction kinetics of Tb<sub>SA</sub>@d-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>. A weak negative band at  $v = 1470 \text{ cm}^{-1}$  represents the cleavage of the C-N bonds of urea adsorbed at the catalyst surface. The vibrational peak at  $v = 1160 \text{ cm}^{-1}$  is associated with N-H stretching in the urea molecule (amide -CONNH). The weak absorption peaks  $\approx v = 1380 \text{ cm}^{-1}$  and  $v = 2370 \text{ cm}^{-1}$  representing the CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup> and CO<sub>2</sub> in the electrolyte, respectively. Furthermore, the absence of NO<sup>-</sup> vibrational peak ( $v = 2168 \text{ cm}^{-1}$ ) in the in situ FTIR spectra of Tb<sub>SA</sub> @d-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> across all potentials corroborates the catalyst's high selectivity for N2 formation via urea decomposition. The potential dependent in situ FTIR spectroscopy reveals that the underlying UOR mechanism of Tb<sub>SA</sub>@d-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> is operated via direct pathways, with possible adsorption intermediates including NH<sub>2</sub>-CO-NH<sub>2</sub>, \*NH-CO-NH<sub>2</sub>, CO(\*N-NH<sub>2</sub>), \*NCO(HN), \*N—CO—N, CO\*, \*COOH and \*CO<sub>2</sub>.[25]

To investigate the role of Tb-doping on the catalytic performance of d-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, we utilized density functional theory (DFT) calculations to evaluate the reaction pathways and charge transfer characteristics for UOR. As depicted in Figure 4c, the UOR process is thermodynamically spontaneous and follows the sequence: \*  $\rightarrow$  \*CO(NH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>  $\rightarrow$  \*NHCONH<sub>2</sub>  $\rightarrow$  \*NCONH<sub>2</sub>  $\rightarrow$ \*NCONH  $\rightarrow$  \*NCON  $\rightarrow$  \*CO + N<sub>2</sub>(g)  $\rightarrow$  \*COOH  $\rightarrow$  \*CO<sub>2</sub>(g). [24b] The comparison of potential energy surface plots for UOR on d-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> and O-deficient Tb<sub>SA</sub> @d-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> catalysts reveals significant insights into the impact of "Tb" doping. The DFT calculations show that while the Gibbs free energy of urea adsorption is slightly more favorable on the undoped d-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> surface compared to Tb-doped Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, the critical enhancement in catalytic activity arises from the improved reaction kinetics due to "Tb" doping. The potential determining step (PDS) for the Odeficient  $Tb_{SA}@d-Co_3O_4$  catalyst (NCONH<sub>2</sub>  $\rightarrow$ NCONH) has a significantly lower energy barrier of 1.44 eV compared to the

PDS for the d-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> catalyst (NHCONH<sub>2</sub>  $\rightarrow$  NHCONH), which is 1.93 eV. This lower energy barrier indicates that "Tb" doping enhances the reaction kinetics, and accelerates the dissociation of urea intermediates, making the overall UOR process more efficient on the Tb-doped catalyst. The Gibbs free energy profile shows that the intermediate states and their transitions are more energetically favorable on the Tb-doped d-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> surface. Specifically, the energy barriers for key steps are consistently lower on Tb<sub>SA</sub>@d-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, facilitating smoother transitions between intermediates and ultimately leading to improved catalytic performance. The transition from NCONH2 to NCON on the Tb<sub>SA</sub> @d-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> catalyst exhibits a lower energy barrier compared to the same transition on the Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> catalyst. This indicates that "Tb" effectively stabilizes certain intermediates and lowers the overall energy requirement for the UOR process. In addition to the energy barriers, charge transfer analysis provides further insights into the catalytic performance. As shown in the accompanying charge density difference plots (Figures S24a-d, Supporting Information), the charge accumulation on the urea molecule adsorbed on Tb<sub>SA</sub>@d-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> is significantly reduced  $(-0.15e^{-})$  compared to that on  $Co_3O_4$   $(-1.17e^{-})$ . This reduction in charge transfer indicates a weaker interaction between the urea molecule and the Tb-doped surface, facilitating easier desorption of products. The bond length of the Tb-N bond (2.63 Å) is longer than that of the Co-N bond (2.18 Å), confirming that "Tb" doping alters the charge distribution on the surface and enhances the desorption process. The first step of urea adsorption also shows more balanced energy between adsorption and desorption on the O-deficient Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> catalyst compared to Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>. This balanced energy profile supports the protonation of the reaction process, further contributing to the improved catalytic performance of the Tb-doped catalyst. Therefore, the Tb<sub>SA</sub> @d-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> electrocatalyst demonstrates significant advantages in the UOR process, attributed to optimized reaction energetics and favorable charge transfer characteristics. The reduced energy barriers for potential determining steps and improved desorption dynamics due to "Tb" doping underscore the enhanced catalytic performance. This study highlights the potential of Tb<sub>SA</sub>@d-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> as an efficient catalyst for UOR, emphasizing the importance of tailored doping strategies in the design of high-performance catalysts.

These DFT findings are well supported by the XPS and XANES data, which confirm the introduction of oxygen vacancies improves the conductivity of Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>. This enhancement is further corroborated by the lower charge transfer resistance observed in EIS measurements, indicating faster electron transport in the defect-rich catalyst. Thus, the superior catalytic performance of Tb<sub>SA</sub>@d-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> results from a synergistic combination of improved conductivity from defect engineering and accelerated reaction kinetics due to "Tb" doping.

under identical experimental conditions as UOR, demonstrated the best HER performance. The negligible change in HER performance is observed after adding the 0.5 м urea solution in 1 м КОН (Figure 5a). It guaranteed that the addition of urea in the electrolyte has negligible impact on the HER activity of Tb<sub>SA</sub>@d-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>. The Tb<sub>SA</sub>@d-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> displayed a superior HER activity, requiring an overpotential of -35 mV to obtain a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. The HER performance of Tb<sub>SA</sub>@d- $Co_3O_4$  is identical and superior to the traditional Pt/C and RuO<sub>2</sub>, respectively (Figures 5b,c). The noble metal mass normalized HER of Tb<sub>SA</sub>@d-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> was much superior than the Pt/C signifying an admirable intrinsic activity of "Tb" over the noble metal Pt (Figure S25d, Supporting Information). The outstanding HER performance of Tb<sub>SA</sub>@d-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> is comparable with the reported catalyst in Table S3 (Supporting Information). This observation elucidates that Tb<sub>SA</sub> played a pivotal role in enhancing the HER performance by offering maximal exposed active centers. The superior HER reaction Kinetics was further corroborated by the smallest Tafel slope value of 32 mVdec<sup>-1</sup> than the Tb<sub>SA</sub>@Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, d-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, and commercial Pt/C. Based on these consequences, the Volmer–Heyrovsky mechanism is the suggested HER mechanism for Tb<sub>SA</sub>@d-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (Figure 5d). The lowest Charge transfer resistance further confirms the remarkable HER activity of Tb<sub>SA</sub>@d-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>. The stability of the catalysts is also a considerable factor. The Tb<sub>SA</sub>@d-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> also displayed remarkable HER stability at  $-100~\text{mA}~\text{cm}^{-2}$  for 100 h with no apparent decay in the activity (Figure S26, Supporting Information). The post-stability analysis (XRD, SEM, XPS, and EDS in Figure S27 (Supporting Information) further confirm the maintenance of the original structure and chemical state signifying superb chemical stability of Tb<sub>SA</sub>@d-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>.

#### 2.6. Mechanistic Study for Enhanced HER Activity

The impressive HER performance of  $Tb_{SA}@d-Co_3O_4$  can be attributed to the favorable water adsorption and efficient watersplitting kinetics introduced by "Tb" single-atom doping (Figure S28, Supporting Information). The DFT calculations reveal that the free energy of  $H_2O$  adsorption on  $Tb_{SA}@d-Co_3O_4$  is

significantly lower at −0.80 eV compared to −0.31 eV on the d-Co3O4 surface. This stronger adsorption facilitates the cleavage of H2O molecules, allowing for easier dissociation into H\* and OH\* intermediates. The Gibbs free energy differences between these intermediates and H2O\* are also notable, with values of −0.67 eV for and 0.1 eV for H\*\_OH\*, indicating that Tb-doping promotes favorable energetics for water dissociation.

The kinetic energy barrier, which is considered a critical factor in HER under alkaline conditions,[\[26\]](#page-13-0) is substantially reduced with "Tb" doping. The Nudged Elastic Band (NEB) method shows that the kinetic barrier for water dissociation on TbSA@d-Co3O4 is only 0.84 eV, significantly lower than the 1.53 eV barrier observed on d-Co3O4, as shown in Figures S29a,b (Supporting Information). This reduction in the activation energy highlights the catalytic superiority of TbSA@d-Co3O4, making it a more efficient catalyst for HER. These insights collectively demonstrate that "Tb" doping not only enhances water adsorption but also lowers the kinetic barrier for the water-splitting process, explaining the superior HER activity of TbSA@d-Co3O4 over the undoped counterpart.

#### **2.7. Electrocatalytic Bi-Functional Overall Urea Electrolysis**

The outstanding UOR and HER activity of TbSA@d-Co3O4 encouraged us to move a step closer toward practical application by constructing a bifunctional catalytic urea electrolyzer for energysaving H2 production. Hence, we assembled a device using TbSA@d-Co3O4 as a cathode and anode for observing the overall performance as a bifunctional catalyst in alkaline media. As shown in Figure [5e](#page-9-0) urea electrolysis has a significant advantage as compared to water electrolysis in terms of H2 generation. The overall urea electrolysis system required 260 mV less voltage than the water electrolysis system to attain a current density of 50 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2. The urea electrolysis needed an operating voltage of 1.22, 1.44, and 1.53 V to attain a current density of 10, 50 and 100 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2, respectively as shown in Figure S30 (Supporting Information). The bi-functional TbSA@d-Co3O4-based urea electrolyzer significantly saves ≈16% more energy for H2 production than the water electrolyzer. The TbSA@d-Co3O4 (+) ║ TbSA@d-Co3O4 (−) based urea electrolyzer outperforms the traditional noble metal based RuO2 (+) ║ Pt/C (−) electrolyzer. The cell voltage of a mere 1.22 V at 10 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> competes with the recently reported urea electrolyzer (Figure [5f](#page-9-0) and Table S4, Supporting Information). The chronoamperometric analysis (Figure [5h\)](#page-9-0) at 50 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> confirms the excellent long-term stability of assembled TbSA@d-Co3O4 (+) ║ TbSA@d-Co3O4 (−) with 93% retention after 100 h. The overlapping LSV curves after the long-term stability affirm the exceptional durability of TbSA@d-Co3O4 (inset Figure [5h\)](#page-9-0). The urea electrolyzer continuously produces the H2 during the stability. Moreover, the H2 production of the urea electrolyzer is much higher than the water electrolyzers, with a faradaic efficiency of 97.5% compared to the water electrolyzer at 1.6 V (inset Figure [5h](#page-9-0) middle). The urea electrolyzer exhibited an excellent UOR faradaic efficiency of ≈94% as detailed in Figure S31 (Supporting Information). The urea concentration has no negative impact on the overall electrolyzer activity as observed in 100 h of continuous stability operation, deliberating its significance for sustainable fuel production.

### **2.8. Sustainable Energy-Driven Alkaline Urea-Assisted Water Electrolysis**

Although urea-assisted electrolysis offers clean H2 production along with environmental remediation, it is still subjected to relies on external electrical consumption which can be regulated. Recently several sustainable methods including 1.5 V batteries, triboelectric nanogenerators, and solar cells, have been integrated with electrolysis to develop self-powered electrolyzer systems on a small scale. Motivated by the concept of a renewable and self-sustaining system, we integrated the fabricated urea-assisted water electrolyzer with a triboelectric module, battery assembly, and solar to obtain clean H2, as shown in **Figure [6](#page-11-0)**. A triboelectric setup integrated with the TbSA@d-Co3O4 (+) ║TbSA@d-Co3O4 (−) urea-assisted water electrolyzer is shown in Figures [6a,c.](#page-11-0) Constant mechanical force is applied, to generate a voltage of ≈1.8 V (±0.1 V), to drive the urea-based water electrolyzer. Also, the commercial battery setup (1.5 V) was assembled with the TbSA@d-Co3O4 (+) ║TbSA@d-Co3O4 (−) urea-assisted water electrolyzer to provide a chemically renewable input for driving the urea-assisted electrolyzer as shown in Figures [6b,d.](#page-11-0) In both scenarios, the H2 evolution and the urea oxidation with bubbles were monitored and recorded on the surface of the electrodes (Supplementary Movie). The commercial photovoltaic module was applied to power the TbSA@d-Co3O4 (+) ║TbSA@d-Co3O4 (−) urea-assisted water electrolyzer as shown in Figures [6e,f.](#page-11-0) The plenteous bubbles have been generated at the surface of the cathode and anode, indicating the capability of the electrocatalysts under the solar system. Based on this, it is concluded that a TbSA@d-Co3O4 (+) ║TbSA@d-Co3O4 (−) electrode could effectively assist urea-based water electrolysis using a sustainable, self-powered, and renewable input. This highlights a promising and commercially viable method for scaling up green H2 generation along with biological remediation.

## **3. Conclusion**

In summary, we developed a self-supported defect-rich d-Co3O4 topologically doped with rare earth single atom "Tb" (TbSA) by oxygen coordination. Benefitting from the strong coordination of Tb with d-Co3O4, the TbSA@d-Co3O4 exhibited excellent stability for electrocatalytic H2 evolution reaction (HER) and Urea oxidation reaction (UOR). Moreover, the catalyst merely required a voltage of 1.27 and −35 mV to attain a current density of 100 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> during UOR and HER, respectively. The mechanistic studies revealed that "TbSA" doping reduced energy barriers for potential determining steps, favorable charge transfer characteristics for UOR, improved desorption dynamics, and underscored the enhanced catalytic performance. The assembled 2 electrode urea assisted hybrid electrolyzer, the TbSA@d-Co3O4 outputs a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> at 1.22 V. The assembled UOR electrolyzer can be successfully driven by the triboelectric nanogenerator, commercial battery (1.5 V), and solar panel, signifying its execution in terms of various renewable energy sources. This work not only offers a perspective insight into energy-saving H2 generation via hybrid electrolysis but also opens a new avenue to uncover the undiscovered properties of RE metal-based catalysts for various energy conversion applications.

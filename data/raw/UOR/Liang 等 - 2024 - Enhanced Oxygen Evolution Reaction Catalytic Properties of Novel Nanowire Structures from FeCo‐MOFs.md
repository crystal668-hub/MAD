# Enhanced Oxygen Evolution Reaction Catalytic Properties of Novel Nanowire Structures from FeCo-MOFs/GO via Low-Temperature Annealing

Hao Liang, Yangbo Lv, Kui Tang, Yuxin Chai, Yu Yang, Zhi Yang, Yuyang Liu, and Jianping Sun\*

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) often suffer from poor stability, making them suitable precursors for metal oxides/porous carbon catalysts in the oxygen evolution reaction via pyrolysis. High-temperature treatment, however, leads to significant loss of active sites. To address this, Fe-MOFs, FeCo-MOFs, and FeCo-MOFs/graphene oxide (GO) composites using a one-pot hydrothermal method are synthesized and annealed at a low temperature of 300 °C. Characterization reveals that FeCo-MOFs/GO composites possess unique nanowire structures mixed with a small amount of nanoflakes. It is believed that introducing graphene oxide plays a critical role in forming this structure, because the defects in GO provide numerous nucleation sites for nanowire growth. With high specific surface area and good stability, these nanostructures show a low overpotential of 261.5 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> and a Tafel slope of 20.47 mV dec<sup>-1</sup> in 1 mol L<sup>-1</sup> KOH alkaline water electrolysis. Density functional theory calculations further indicate that the synergistic effect of Fe and Co atoms enhances the catalytic activity.

#### 1. Introduction

In the past few decades, the overconsumption of fossil fuels has led to increasingly severe global warming and environmental pollution problems. To address these issues, people have made efforts to develop new clean energy resources as alternatives to traditional fossil fuels. Hydrogen is considered the best replacement due to its high calorific value (142 MJ kg $^{-1}$ ), low density (0.089 g L $^{-1}$ ), and environmental friendliness. For hydrogen production, H $_2$  from water electrolysis driven by renewable energy sources such as solar energy, wind energy, geothermal energy, etc. is an ideal method for industrial-scale hydrogen production. However, suitable catalysts are necessary to reduce the overpotential ( $\eta$ ) of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at the cathode. Compared to the two-electron transfer HER reaction, the four-electron proton-coupled OER reaction has higher energy

barriers, slower dynamics, and lower efficiency. [6,7] Currently, noble metal-based catalysts such as Ir/Ru are still the most widely used OER catalysts, but their limited reserves and high cost hinder their largescale application. [8,9] Therefore, developing stable and highly efficient OER catalysts for large-scale production at low costs is a key factor for the industrial breakthrough of water electrolysis technology.[10,11] Recently, transition metals (such as Fe. Co, and Ni) and their oxides have garnered significant attention in the field of electrocatalysis due to their unique d electron configurations and abundant Earth reserves. [12,13] Some transition metal hydroxides show higher OER properties in alkaline media. However, the catalytic activities of most transition metal catalysts are still too low compared to precious metals.

In order to further improve their activities, bimetallic electrocatalysts have also been studied.  $^{[14]}$ 

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are organic-inorganic hybrid crystalline materials formed by metal cations and organic ligands through coordination bonds. [15] Due to their advantages of diversified structure, adjustable pore height, large specific surface area, and ease of preparation, they have been extensively studied as promising catalysts in the field of water electrolysis. [16,17] Janiak et al. adopted a simple one-step hydrothermal method to synthesize nickel-based columnar MOFs, which demonstrated excellent OER catalytic performance and stability under alkaline conditions. The synergistic effect of the bimetallic nickel-iron MOF with the conductive mKB additive enhanced the catalytic activity of the MOF/mKB composite material. The Biradha group and others applied a simple and convenient in situ solvent-thermal method, through which they directly grew a newly synthesized Mn(II)-based carboxylate original MOF (Mn-MOF) on the conductive substrate of nickel foam (NF), preparing a self-supported, binder-free 3D electrode (Mn-MOF/NF). The synergistic action of two redox-active metal center (Mn2+ and Ni2+), along with the excellent supporting surface of the NF, which prevented the self-aggregation of active sites, played a decisive role in enhancing the OWS catalytic performance. [18,19]. In fact, as heterogeneous catalysts, MOFs possess some characteristics of homogeneous catalysts, such as a very high density of uniformly dispersed metal active atoms.

Additionally, the large specific surface area and porous structure not only expose a large number of active sites but also contribute to the rapid transport of the electrolyte solution, thereby further enhancing catalytic performance. [20-22] However, the poor conductivity and stability of MOFs limit their practical application in the field of electrocatalysis. Therefore, a common strategy to increase stability and electrical conductivity is to utilize MOFs as precursors to prepare metallic compounds/porous carbon materials through pyrolysis. [23,24] Nevertheless, during this process, the pyrolysis of ligands and the subsequent sintering of metal particles inevitably lead to a substantial loss of active sites due to structural changes, resulting in a deterioration of catalytic performance. [25] Therefore, it is of great significance to enhance the stability of MOF catalysts while minimizing the impact on their catalytic performance during heat treatment. Pariyar et al. obtained pure porous α-Mn2O3 composite materials (PSKU-1 and PSKU-2) through heat treatment at 600 °C of hydrothermally synthesized [Mn2(DOT)(H2O)2]n (Mn-SKU-1) and [Mn2(DOT)2(BPY)2(THF)]n (Mn-SKU-2) (DOT = 2,5-dihydroxyterephthalate; BPY = 4,4'-bipyridine). These materials have advantages such as low cost, ease of use, high stability, and higher recyclability compared to Pt/C. [26]

As the first discovered 2D material, graphene possesses excellent chemical stability, superb mechanical properties, and unique electrical and optical properties. Graphene and graphene-derived materials have been extensively studied in the fields of electronics, supercapacitors, lithium-ion batteries, and more. [27,28] However, due to its chemical inertness, intrinsic graphene does not exhibit catalytic activity. Therefore, its application as a catalyst typically requires doping or using it as a substrate to construct composite structures. The combination

of MOFs and graphene-derived materials can harness the advantages of both. [29] In particular, graphene oxide (GO), which contains a large number of defects and oxygen-containing functional groups, allows MOFs to anchor onto its functional groups. The epoxy groups and hydroxyl groups on the surface of GO can chelate with metal ions in MOFs, thereby enhancing conductivity and electrocatalytic activity.[30-32]

In this study, two inexpensive and readily available transition metals, Fe and Co, were chosen to prepare three distinct MOF structures (Fe-MOF, FeCo-MOF, FeCo-MOF/GO) using a onepot hydrothermal method. To minimize the structural changes caused by heat treatment, the samples were annealed at 300 °C, and their suitability for OER electrolysis was examined. Experimental characterizations revealed that the bimetallic catalyst (FeCo-MOF/GO) derived from the composite of MOFs and GO exhibits unique 1D nanowire structures, which increase the specific surface area and accelerate mass/charge transfer. Electrochemical tests demonstrated that the overpotential required to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> is only 261.5 mV, with a Tafel slope of 20.47 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>. Additionally, it exhibits good stability in a  $1 \text{ mol } L^{-1}$  KOH solution. Furthermore, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were employed to investigate the underlying mechanism.

300 to 500 nm. The FeCo-MOF particle sizes range from 50 to 100 nm. Compared with Fe-MOF, the FeCo-MOF particle sizes are smaller, and the specific surface area of the samples is increased, resulting in more exposed active sites as OER catalysts. Notably, Figure 1c,d shows that, after the addition of GO, the prepared FeCo-MOF/GO sample primarily consists of novel 1D nanowire structures mixed with a small amount of nanoflakes. The well-crystallized nanowires have a high aspect ratio and well-defined morphology, and they grow in a preferentially oriented manner. Figure 1d shows that the diameter of the nanowires falls within the range of 40–60 nm. In this case, GO plays a critical role in the growth of nanowires, which can be attributed to the nucleation effect of oxygen-containing functional groups.[33,34] These unique structures not only retain a high specific surface area but also can accelerate mass/charge transfer, boosting the reaction kinetics of catalysts, which is beneficial for catalytic applications.

Figure 1e,f displays TEM images of FeCo-MOF/GO. As shown in Figure 1e, FeCo-MOF/GO exhibits a nanowire structure with a diameter of 40–60 nm, which is consistent with the SEM test results. Figure 1f shows a high-magnification image that

indicates the amorphous nature or the presence of only very weak crystals in the FeCo-MOF/GO material treated at 300 °C. This is confirmed by XRD data. MOFs with high crystallinity often exhibit slow electron transfer and limited active sites, which hinder the improvement of catalytic activity. However, the disordered atomic arrangement and aperiodic structure resulting from low crystallinity provide the catalyst with abundant defects, which is beneficial for charge transfer and reducing the reaction barrier.

Figure 1g shows the energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) image of FeCo-MOF/GO, and Figure 1h–k shows the corresponding element mappings, demonstrating the uniform distribution of Fe, Co, O, and C elements in the sample. These results confirm the successful preparation of Fe and Co elements combined with FeCo-MOF/GO.

Figure 2a illustrates the Fourier spectra of Fe-MOF, FeCo-MOF, and FeCo-MOF/GO catalysts. The three samples exhibit similar spectra and demonstrate comparable coordination structures. The broad peak observed at 3000–3700 cm<sup>1</sup> is associated with bound water present in the samples and arises from the stretching vibration of OH-.[35] In all three products, the peak

at 1578 cm<sup>-1</sup> is attributed to the asymmetric stretching vibration of the carboxylic group. [36,37] The peak at 1396 cm<sup>-1</sup> is caused by the CO- vibration resulting from the deprotonation of the hydroxyl group after coordination. The characteristic bands of the undissociated hydroxyl and carboxylic groups of the ligand are not detected in the final product, indicating the strong interaction between the ligand and metal ions. The infrared spectra confirm the successful preparation of Fe-MOF, FeCo-MOF, and FeCo-MOF/GO composites.

Figure 2b presents the XRD spectrum of FeCo-MOF/GO after hydrothermal synthesis at 100 °C and two simulated patterns from the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Center, which are MOF-74 (CCDC no. 985 792) and Co-MOF (CCDC no. 153 067) respectively. As shown in the Figure, at low diffraction angles  $2\theta$ , peak 1 (11.7°) and peak 4 (6.8°) correspond exactly to the two main peaks of MOF-74, as reported by Zhao et al. [38] while peak 2 (17.8°) and peak 3 (8.8°) match exactly the two main peaks of Co-MOF (Co<sub>2</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub>C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>4</sub>O<sub>4</sub>).<sup>[39]</sup> As shown in Figure 1c–e, the nanowires grow in a preferentially oriented manner and are well crystallized. This accounts for the reason why in Figure 1, peak 1 is very strong while peak 4 is very weak. In general, except for noise signals, all the peaks can be attributed to these two phases. Consistent with the SEM images shown in Figure 1, we believe that our samples are mainly FeCo-MOF-74 nanowires mixed with a certain amount of other MOF  $(Co_2(OH)_2C_8H_4O_4)$  nanoflakes. This result is similar to the previously reported MOF-74, [38–40] confirming the successful preparation of FeCo composite MOFs. As shown in Figure 2c, after low-temperature heat treatment, the low-angle characteristic peak in the XRD spectrum of FeCo-MOF/GO disappears, indicating the characteristic of amorphous materials, which is consistent with the TEM results. Upon annealing at 400 °C, the characteristic peaks at  $2\theta = 30.5^{\circ}$  and  $36.1^{\circ}$  are attributed to the (140) and (202) crystal planes of Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> (JCPDS No. 33-0665), respectively. The characteristic peak at  $2\theta = 63.4^{\circ}$  corresponds to the (300) crystal plane of Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> (JCPDS No. 33-0664), indicating that the MOFs undergo pyrolytic carbonization and develop toward a metal compound/porous carbon structure at 400 °C.[41]

Figure 3a shows the XPS spectra of FeCo-MOF/GO. As depicted in Figure 3a, the Co 2p spectra of FeCo-MOF/GO exhibit distinct bands of Co  $2p_{3/2}$  and Co  $2p_{1/2}$  at 780.4 and 795.9 eV, respectively. The separation between the two bands is  $15.5 \, \text{eV}$ , indicating that Co is mainly in the +2 valence state. [42,43] The Fe  $\bar{2}p$  peaks in FeCo-MOF/GO (711.0 and 724.6 eV) and their corresponding satellite peaks (715.9 and 734.5 eV), as well as peaks (712.8 and 726.4 eV) and their corresponding satellite peaks (715.9 and 739.4 eV), demonstrate the existence of Fe<sup>2+</sup> and Fe<sup>3+</sup>, respectively. [44,45] Figure 3b presents a comparison of the Fe 2p XPS spectra of Fe-MOF and FeCo-MOF/GO. In Fe-MOF, the peaks (710.7 and 724.3 eV) and their corresponding satellite peaks (712.9 and 732.6 eV) indicate that Fe primarily exists in the state of Fe<sup>2+</sup>. After the bimetal combination, some valence states of Fe changed, suggesting that the iron atom loses electrons.[46,47]

#### 2.2. The Catalytic Performance of Catalysts

In a 1 M KOH electrolyte, a catalyst-loaded nickel foam was utilized as the working electrode to evaluate the OER performance of the samples, while a blank nickel foam without catalyst was tested for comparison. All data were adjusted using an 85% IR compensation curve. Figure 4a illustrates the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves of the blank foam nickel (NF), Fe-MOF/ NF, FeCo-MOF/NF, and FeCo-MOF/GO/NF. The results indicate that Fe-MOF, FeCo-MOF, and FeCo-MOF/GO require different overpotentials of 330, 296, and 261.5 mV, respectively, to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. The NF necessitates an overpotential of 346 mV to reach the same current density. It is evident that FeCo-MOF exhibits a lower overpotential compared to Fe-MOF, while FeCo-MOF/GO exhibits the lowest overpotential. As shown in Figure 4b, the Tafel slopes for NF, Fe-MOF/NF, FeCo-MOF/NF, and FeCo-MOF/GO/NF are 43.7, 32.2, 24.58, and 20.47 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. A lower Tafel slope is advantageous for catalyst applications since it implies that OER performance can be enhanced by slightly increasing the overpotential. Thus, it can be concluded that FeCo-MOF/GO exhibits the lowest Tafel slope.

In order to further investigate the OER properties of the catalysts, cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves were measured at different scanning rates in the non-Faraday region. The fitting slope ( $C_{\rm dl}$ ) can provide information about the size of the electrochemically active area. [48] This study plotted the scanning rate-current density difference graphs and obtained the fitting slopes, as shown in Figure 4c. The C<sub>dl</sub> values for NF, Fe-MOF, FeCo-MOF, and FeCo-MOF/GO are 13.36, 13.97, 14.11, and 20.86 mF cm<sup>-2</sup> respectively.

In summary, among the OER catalysts, FeCo-MOF exhibits superior performance compared to Fe-MOF, and FeCo-MOF/ GO demonstrates the best performance. This can be attributed to two reasons. First, as confirmed by DFT calculations, the synergistic effect of the FeCo bimetal enhances the catalytic activity of the active sites. Second, as depicted in Figure 1a,b, the formation of the FeCo composition results in a reduction in the size of the catalyst particles, thereby increasing the specific surface area and density of active sites. Regarding FeCo-MOF/GO, as shown in Figure 1c, it exhibits a novel hierarchical nanowire structure. This structure possesses a very high specific surface area, and the open architecture of the hierarchical nanowires facilitates mass transport during the catalytic process. Additionally, the addition of GO improves conductivity, which is beneficial for electron transfer.

Durability and stability are crucial factors for evaluating catalyst performance. This study conducted *I-T* curve testing of the catalysts in a 1 M KOH solution for 6 h, and the results are presented in Figure 4d. Throughout the test, the current density remained stable, indicating the excellent stability of FeCo-MOF/GO in an alkaline environment. After 6 h, no significant decrease in catalytic current density was observed.

## 2.3. DFT Calculations

In order to further investigate the synergistic effect of bimetallic FeCo-MOF, we calculated the changes in Gibbs free energy for the single-metal Co-MOF/G and bimetallic FeCo-MOF/G during the OER process. Figure 5 illustrates the difference in catalytic activity between Co-MOF/G and FeCo-MOF/G, investigated using DFT calculations based on VASP package. [49] The OER process is commonly known as a four-coupled proton-electron transfer step involving three adsorption intermediates. [50] The adsorption configurations were examined, adsorption energies of different oxygen-containing intermediates during OER were calculated, and the free energy variations of the four fundamental reaction steps were plotted. Figure 5a,b shows the OER process of Co-MOF/G and FeCo-MOF/G, respectively. In the OER

process with various oxygen-containing intermediates, the Fe and Co metal atoms on the MOF surface initially combine with ionized OH- in water to form \*OH, which is then deprotonated to form \*O. Subsequently, \*O combines with ionized OH- in water to form \*OOH, which decomposes into \*OO and eventually evolves into gaseous  $O_2$  escaping from the metal surface. At U = 0 V, the Gibbs free energy for each step is shown in Figure 5c,d. For Co-MOF/G and FeCo-MOF/G, the changes in free energy ( $\Delta G$ ) of the OER reaction at each step are greater than zero, indicating that every step of the OER reaction on Co-MOF/G and FeCo-MOF/G requires energy absorption to complete. In Figure 5c, the OER reaction process of Co-MOF/G exhibits a  $\Delta G_{\text{max}}$  of 2.25 eV, while in Figure 5d, the OER reaction process of FeCo-MOF/G shows a  $\Delta G_{\text{max}}$  of 2.21 eV. This suggests that the largest energy barrier required for the OER reaction can be reduced through the interaction between Fe and Co metal atoms, thus confirming the experimental findings. It is observed that the bimetallic FeCo-MOF/G lowers the energy required for the reaction and improves the conductivity compared to the monometallic Co-MOF/G. Generally, the synergistic effect between the two metal atoms optimizes the reaction kinetics and enhances the reactivity.

#### 3. Conclusions

In summary, this study successfully synthesized Fe-MOFs, FeCo-MOFs, and FeCo-MOFs/GO composites through a one-pot hydrothermal method followed by annealing at 300 °C. While The Fe-MOF and FeCo-MOF samples are composed of particles, the FeCo-MOF /GO shows unique nanowire structures, which can be attributed to the nucleation effect resulting from GO. The 1D nanowire structures not only have large specific surface area, but also possess enhanced thermal stability because of its resistance to sintering. Electrochemical tests show that, compared with Fe-MOF and FeCo-MOF, the FeCo-MOF/GO exhibits much improved catalytic properties. When the current density reaches 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, OER overpotential is 261.5 mV and Tafel slope is 20.47 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>. In addition, stability is an important characteristic for OER catalysts, no significant decrease in current density was observed in FeCo-MOF/GO during the 6 h I-T curve test. Furthermore, DFT calculations show that compared with single-Fe active sites, the FeCo bimetallic active sites are beneficial to H<sub>2</sub>O breaking step in OER reaction. Therefore, large specific surface area and higher catalytic sites account for the enhanced catalytic properties of FeCo-MOF/GO. These results highlight the potential of FeCo-MOFs/GO composites as efficient and stable OER catalysts for electrocatalytic applications.

purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. Nickel foam (NF) was purchased from Guangshengjia New Materials Co. Ltd. All chemicals were used directly without being further purified.

Synthesis of MOFs: Typically, 1.452 g (6 mmol) Fe(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>·9H<sub>2</sub>O, 1.746 g (6 mmol) Co(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>·6H<sub>2</sub>O, 0.396 g (2 mmol) DOBDC were added to 150 mL ( $V_{DMF}$ :  $V_{anhydrous\ ethanol}$ :  $V_{H2O} = 1:1:1$ ) solution. After magnetic stirring for 30 min, the above solution was poured in a Teflon-lined hydrothermal kettle and heated in a blowing drying oven at 100 °C for 24 h. The products were collected and cleaned with anhydrous ethanol and DMF for several times, and the materials were heat treated at 300 °C. The obtained product was noted as FeCo-MOF. The preparation process of Fe-MOF was similar to FeCo-MOF, but without adding cobalt nitrates. Similar to the above method, 150 mg GO was added along with cobalt nitrates and iron nitrates, while the other treatments were unchanged, and the product was denoted as FeCo-MOF/GO.

Materials Characterization: X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was performed on a D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer (Bruker, Germany). The instrument used Cu K $\alpha$  radiation ( $\lambda = 0.1541$  nm; 40 KV; 40 mA) to scan the  $2\theta$  range of 5°-90° at a scanning rate of 10°/min. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was conducted by MIRA4 field-emission SEM (TESCAN, Czech). The samples were sprayed with gold to enhance the conductivity and directly glued to the conductive adhesive for testing. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) tests were performed using FEI Tecnai F20 transmission electron microscope (Panaco, The Netherlands). A small amount of sample was dispersed in ethanol by ultrasound, and appropriate amount was added to TEM observation and characterized by copper net. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was obtained on a Scientific K-Alpha X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (Thermo, USA). Monochromatic Al K $\alpha$  ( $h\nu=1486.6\,\mathrm{eV}$ ) was used as the radiation source, and C 1s (284.8 eV) was used to correct the electron binding energies of all elements. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was tested on a Scientific Nicolet iS20 Fourier Transform infrared spectrometer (Thermo, USA), with a tablet preparation method and a test range of  $400-4000 \, \text{cm}^{-1}$ .

Electrochemical Measurements: The nickel foam (NF) was cut into square sheets with a size of  $1\times1\,\text{cm}$ , cleaned with hydrochloric acid, deionized water, and C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OH three times, respectively, and dried at room temperature. 2 mg sample catalysts were added to the mixed solution (100  $\mu$ L of deionized water, 100  $\mu$ L of C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OH, and 5  $\mu$ L of 5% Nafion solution). The mixed solution was ultrasonically dispersed for 30 min. After that,  $50\,\mu L$  drops were moved each time with a pipette gun to the pretreated  $0.5 \times 1$  cm nickel foam. After catalysts loading, the NF was dried at room temperature for later use.

Electrochemical tests of the samples were carried out at room temperature using CHI660E electrochemical workstation (Chenhua, Shanghai). A standard three-electrode electrolytic cell was used: saturated calomel electrode (SCE) was used as reference electrode; graphite rod electrode was used as counter electrode; catalyst-loaded nickel foam electrode was used as working electrode. 1 mol L<sup>-1</sup> KOH solution was used as electrolyte solution, and it was ensured that the catalysts-loaded area totally immersed into the solution.

Before each test, 50 cycles of CV curve scanning were carried out at the scanning rate of 100 mV s<sup>-1</sup> to fully activate the electrode material, and electrochemical test was carried out after the performance was stable. All data were corrected with 85% IR compensation curve. We calibrated the electrode following the strategy proposed by Niu et al.  $^{[51]}$  It was found that the correction value of the SCE electrode potential relative to the RHE electrode potential was 1.05 V (in 1 M KOH electrolyte, 25 °C). Therefore, all curve potentials measured were calibrated with respect to reversible hydrogen electrode ( $E_{RHE} = E_{SCE} + 1.05 \text{ V}$ ), where  $E_{SCE}$  is the potential measured with SCE as reference electrode. The Tafel slope was obtained by the formula  $(\eta = \text{blog } (j) + a)$ , where b is the Tafel slope and j is the current density.

DFT Calculation: All calculations in this article were based on DFT and were implemented using the PBE form of generalized gradient approximation<sup>[52]</sup> in Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package (VASP). [53,54] In this article, a 500 eV truncation energy was used to expand the plane wave of electron wave on monolayer graphene. When sampling Brillouin region using Monkhorst-Pack K network, [55] the value of point K was  $3 \times 3 \times 1$ . In the relaxation calculation, the convergence accuracy of force was 0.01 eV A<sup>-1</sup>, the convergence accuracy of energy was 10<sup>-4</sup> eV, and a vacuum layer of 30 Å was added in the Z direction to avoid the interlayer interference caused by the periodic repetition of the 2D structure in the adsorption process. The calculation showed that there is no spin polari-

zation, so spin polarization was not considered. The calculation of DFT-D2<sup>[56,57]</sup> dispersion correction method needed to consider van der Waals interaction (vdWs), which was usually used to calculate monolayer structures. In this article, the monolayer graphene structure adopted  $3 \times 3 \times 1$ supercell (24 carbon atoms).

**The metal-metalloid materials have received a massive interest as oxygenevolving catalysts due to their ability for charge transfer between different elements and modified electronic structures lowering the kinetic energy barriers of the electrochemical processes. Herein, a facile and systematic preparation of metal borides by chemical reduction is reported, with morphologies ranging from nanoparticles to nanosheets which is driven by a careful selection of metal salts solution. The iron doping in cobalt boride nanosheets is found to be an effective approach to further tune the water oxidation activity. The as-prepared catalyst exhibited superior oxygen evolution performance in 1.0 m KOH as the optimized ternary CoFe boride needs an overpotential of 265 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> at a mass loading of 0.3 mg cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> .**

Electrochemical energy conversion and storage devices including metal-air batteries, regenerative fuel cells, and watersplitting cells are critical to satisfy the future energy demand of human society. Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is the key reaction in these technologies and accounts for the major performance loss due to its sluggish kinetics. Precious metal-based catalysts are used predominantly, but the scarcity and low stability limit their application at large scale.[1] As a consequence, intensive efforts have been devoted to developing cost-effective catalysts with superior oxygen-evolving activity and stability.[2]

Earth-abundant metal chalcogens, pnictogens, and metalloids have emerged as potential materials for water oxidation in

alkaline electrolytes.[3] Despite an intensive interest in metal chalcogens and pnictogens over the past years, metal-metalloids such as amorphous metal boride nanostructures has aroused a new interest as efficient earth-abundant oxygen-evolving material.[4] Especially, the transition metals materials including cobalt-based catalysts have a potential application to replace precious metal-based electrocatalyst towards OER.[5] For example, large aggregates of amorphous cobalt boride (Co-B) were found to afford an oxygenevolving current density of 10 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2 at an overpotential of 380 mV.[4a] In addition to their relatively better electrical conductivity than metal oxides/hydroxides, the in

situ transformation of boride to oxyhydroxide during the water oxidation results in rougher surface and more accessible active sites, and as a result, they often exhibit better electrocatalytic activity compared to corresponding metal oxides/hydroxides synthesized directly.[6]

On contrary to time- and cost- consuming synthesis of many other electrocatalysts, the metal boride synthesis by chemical reduction in aqueous media is facile and fast. However, the obtained nanostructures are usually in the form of nanoparticles which could undergo severe aggregation and limit the exposure of active sites.[4a,7] The synthesis of metal boride nanosheets may overcome such limitation, with the additional advantage of enhancing mass transfer.[8] The knowledge of morphological regulation toward nanosheets can provide insights into developing a robust catalyst for a specific application. In the literature, several metal borides or metal-boron based materials are prepared by using different metal salts, however the effect of specific anions on the product morphology is unclear. Thus, it is of paramount importance to unveil the metal borides morphology manipulation and tuning the electrocatalytic performance of metal boride materials.

In this work, we developed a simple chemical reduction process to prepare cobalt boride nanosheets and we further boost the OER activity by Fe doping and using carbon nanotubes as substrate (FexCoy-B/CNT hybrid). It is found that the choice of metal precursor has a critical influence on the resulting morphology. The optimized ternary Fe3Co7-B/CNT hybrid exhibited exceptionally high activity for water oxidation and prominent stability in a 1.0 m KOH electrolyte. An overpotential of 265 mV was needed to achieve the current density of 10 mA cm−<sup>2</sup> , which is much better than 354 mV needed of commercial IrO2

catalyst at the same loading. In addition to the boost in activity from iron doping, the nanosheet borides integrated with CNT provided improved conductivity to enhance the electrocatalytic activity.

The metal boride materials were synthesized by a facile chemical reduction in an ice-bath and argon environment. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image (**Figure 1**a) of pristine Co-B prepared by using cobalt nitrate shows a 2D nanosheet morphology. In contrast, the pristine Co-B (Figure 1b) prepared by using cobalt chloride (Co-B(Cl)) shows aggregated nanoparticle morphology with a core/shell nanostructure of around 25 nm diameter which agrees with the literature.[7b] We also prepared two other Co-B by using cobalt sulfate and cobalt acetate [Co-B(S) and Co-B(Ac), respectively] while maintaining other conditions the same. It is observable that the Co-B(S) was predominantly aggregated nanoparticles mixed with large nanosheets, while the Co-B(Ac) showed severe aggregated nanoparticles (Figure S1, Supporting Information). From this observation, it suggests that the anions have an impact on the growth of Co-B precipitate in the solution. By considering two samples with extreme morphology (chloride vs nitrate for nanoparticles vs nanosheets, respectively), the difference in morphology can be attributed to a phenomenon where nitrate suppresses the fast reduction of metal ions which leads to 2D cobalt boride nanosheets formation while Cl− promotes fast reduction reaction to form 3D nanoparticles. During the synthesis, there is another reaction (instantaneous hydrolysis of the metal salt), in competition with the reduction reaction. Some conditions have been reported favoring a significant amount of metal hydroxide formation such as uncontrolled temperature in the reaction vessel, the addition of aged reducing reagent in the presence of a strong alkali.[9] The preparation conditions must be controlled to promote metal boride formation and suppress the secondary reaction. Otherwise, the obtained sample would contain a substantial amount of hydroxide (Figure S2, Supporting Information). The incorporation of Fe doping and CNT does not seem to affect the nanosheet morphology. As shown in Figure 1c,d and Figure S3, Supporting Information, a rippled silk nanosheets morphology was observed for binary boride/ CNT hybrids suggesting an ultrathin feature. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (The inset Figure 1d) shows only a weak reflection halo, suggesting an amorphous nature of the boride.[10] Various hybrid FexCoy-B/CNT catalysts (in which *x/y* represents the molar ratio of Fe/Co) were then prepared using cobalt nitrate as a metal precursor. The high-resolution TEM images and SAED patterns of FexCoy-B/CNT (Figure 1e and Figure S4, Supporting Information) show the nanosheets morphologies and the absence of lattice fringe, implying the porous and amorphous nature. After the OER testing (Figure S5, Supporting Information), the nanosheets morphology was maintained which implies that the in situ transformation could ensure larger surface areas.[11]

The as-prepared metal boride hybrids and CNT as a control sample were further characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), and the patterns are shown in Figure 1f. The XRD pattern of CNT shows two peaks at 26° and 42°, which were indexed to the (002) and (101) reflections of hexagonal graphite, respectively (JCPDS, Card No. 75- 1621). The pristine Fe3Co7-B

shows no significant peak, which reveals the amorphous state of the metal boride material prepared by chemical reduction in aqueous solution.[4c,10] On the other hand, the XRD pattern of Fe3Co7-B/CNT and binary boride/CNT (Figure S6a, Supporting Information) show no obvious peaks from CNT which implies hybrid material. The as-prepared hybrid material showed a large specific surface area of about 4.8 times compared to the pristine catalyst (Figure S6c, Supporting Information). The BET surface area of Fe3Co7-B/CNT hybrid was 181.1 m2 g<sup>−</sup>1 while it was 37.6 m2 g−1 for the pristine catalyst. Both pristine and ternary hybrid catalysts exhibit a type H3 hysteresis loop, indicating mesoporous structure. The amorphous state implies large surface areas and hence, more likely to exhibit enhanced OER performance.[12] On the contrary, the XRD pattern of Co-BRT showed peaks corresponding to Co hydroxides (Figure S6b, Supporting Information) which agree with the observed color change in Figure S2, Supporting Information.

The wide scan X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectrum of the Fe3Co7-B/CNT material (**Figure 2**a) showed peaks corresponding to Fe, Co, B, C, and O with atomic percentages 2.6, 5.4, 3.4, 64.2, and 24.4%, respectively. The ΣFe/(Fe<sup>+</sup>Co) was around 0.3, showing an efficient synthesis method for the incorporation of a transition metal in binary metal boride. The high-resolution XPS (HRXPS) spectrum of C 1s (Figure 2b) exhibits four peaks at 284.5, 285.2, 286.2, and 288.9 eV BE for CC (sp2 ), CC (sp<sup>3</sup> ), CO, and C O, typical of C 1s spectrum of graphitic carbon which is from CNT. Figure 2c shows the HRXPS spectrum of B 1s, which can be deconvoluted into two sub-peaks located at 187.9 and 191.9 eV BE, ascribed to the BM and BO bond mainly due to B2O3 and other boron-oxo species, respectively.[13] The former reflects the interaction of B and metal, while the latter is from oxidized B due to exposure to air.[14] The presence of B interacting with metals which are catalytic active sites implies electron transfer to the d bands of the transition metal from B as revealed by a positive shift in BE compared to elemental B (187.2 eV),[10a] and as consequence, metal atoms are electron-rich which makes them highly active for catalytic reactions.[7b,15] Consistently, the BCo (Figure S7a, Supporting Information) and BFe (Figure S7b, Supporting Information) interaction were present in binary boride/CNT hybrid. As shown in Figure 2d,e, the Fe and Co-exist in both elemental (BM) and oxidized (OM) states (M<sup>2</sup>+/3<sup>+</sup>, where M refer to Fe and Co) such as metal oxides and hydroxides due to prolonged air exposure, respectively.[4b,11] This agrees with the literature that metal borides undergo severe oxidation, and hence, the presence of metal oxides and hydroxides is unavoidable.[11] The O 1s XPS spectrum in Figure 2f shows no peak at BE of lattice O, instead, the peaks at 531.6 and 533.4 eV ascribed to surface O and adsorbed O,[16] respectively, were observed emphasizing the predominance of oxidized species on the surface.[13]

The OER performance of the as-prepared materials was tested using a standard three-electrode setup in 1.0 m KOH. All potentials reported are referenced to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE).[17] As revealed in **Figure 3**a and Figure S8, Supporting Information, the Fe3Co7-B/CNT catalyst activity exceeds those of Fe3Co7-B, binary Co- or FeB, and IrO2. Only an overpotential (η10) of 265 mV was required to afford a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2 (Figure 3b). In contrast, the Fe3Co7-B and IrO2 delivered the same *J*10 at 282 and 354 mV, respectively. By doping iron at ΣFe/(Fe+Co) = 0.3 the onset potential reduced from 277 to 232 mV (Figure 3b). This implies the synergistic effect of transition metals in ternary metal

borides.<sup>[4c,18]</sup> The high activity of the Fe3Co7-B/CNT is comparable or exceeds the activities of many cobalt-based OER electrocatalysts (see Table S1, Supporting Information).

The Tafel plot in Figure 3c shows that the slope of Fe3Co7-B/ CNT is 30 mV dec<sup>-1</sup> which is smaller compared to Fe3Co7-B, Co-B/CNT, Fe-B/CNT, and even IrO2 catalyst. Owing to the presence of metalloid element (B) with higher electronegativity, the electron transfer and modified electronic configuration would facilitate the electrochemical reactions which explain better kinetics for water oxidation of metal boride leading to reduced overpotentials losses.<sup>[19]</sup> The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) technique was then performed to understand the large increase of current density at a low potential compared to IrO2. As shown in Figure 3d, the Fe3Co7-B/CNT displayed a smaller semicircle diameter compared to Fe3Co7-B, Co-B/ CNT, and Fe-B/CNT. The amount of CNT was found to have an influence on the activity (Figure 3e and Figure S9, Supporting Information). At optimized ratio, the hybrid material showed smaller series resistance  $R_s$  (5.2  $\Omega$ ) and charge transfer resistance  $R_{ct}$  (2.1  $\Omega$ ) compared to Fe3Co7-B ( $R_s$  of 7.2  $\Omega$ ) and  $R_{ct}$  of 4.4  $\Omega$ ). This reveals that the CNT greatly affects the conductivity and charge transfer kinetics of the catalyst film.

We next assessed the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) measured by the double layer capacitance ( $C_{\rm dl}$ ) method on the basis of cyclic voltammetry (CV). The calculated  $C_{\rm dl}$  doubled from 2.9 mF cm<sup>-2</sup> for Co-B/CNT to 6.0 mF cm<sup>-2</sup> for Fe3Co7-B/CNT (Figure S10, Supporting Information and Figure 3f). Additionally, the mass activity calculated at a  $\eta$  of 320 mV, increased from 3.5 to 123 A g<sup>-1</sup>. To evaluate the intrinsic activity due to iron doping and morphology, the current density was normalized by ECSA (Figure S11, Supporting Information). At 300 mV the current density was 0.007 and

0.12 mA ECSA<sup>-1</sup> for Co-B/CNT and Fe3Co7-B/CNT hybrid, respectively. This further implies the synergistic effect of doping iron in cobalt boride/CNT hybrid.

The effect of iron doping level in cobalt boride was investigated and the iR-corrected LSV curves are shown in **Figure** 4a. The Fe3Co7-B/CNT exhibited the highest activity (Figure 4b and Figure S12–S14, Supporting Information). The  $\eta_{10}^{[20]}$  are 338, 275, 265, 270, and 287 mV for FexCoy-B/CNT with 0:1, 2:8, 3:7, 5:5, and 7:3, respectively (Figure 4b). This decrease and the positive shift in redox peaks in Figure S12, Supporting Information reflect the synergistic effect to boost the activity of binary boride catalyst observed in Figure 3b. Another criterion to investigate the intrinsic catalytic properties is the turnover frequency (TOF). [20] By assuming all the metal sites were involved in the electrochemical reaction, the Fe3Co7-B/CNT showed the highest TOF of 0.43 s<sup>-1</sup> calculated at 300 mV among all the FexCoy-B/CNT hybrids (Table S2, Supporting Information), further supporting the highest OER activity of Fe3Co7-B/CNT in this study.

The stability of earth-abundant electrocatalysts is a critical factor for their practical applications in electrochemical devices. In 1.0 M KOH, the stability of the optimized Fe3Co7-B/CNT hybrid catalyst was investigated by CV under continuous 1000 cycles. The iR-corrected LSV curves and the semicircle diameter in the Nyquist plot almost overlapped in Figure 4c. Additionally, the Tafel plot in Figure S15, Supporting Information showed similar Tafel slope. These observations and the negligible change of OER potential on the chronopotentiometric curve on Figure 4d suggest good stabilities for the as-prepared hybrid catalyst. The prominent stability benefits from the nanosheet morphology and metal-metalloid covalent bonding nature. The advanced electrocatalytic properties are first attributed to the amorphous state of metal borides

nanosheets capable of providing large surface area and accessibility of more active sites for water oxidation. Secondly, the iron doping contributed to improved intrinsic activity to optimize the performance. Thirdly, the in situ transformation into metal oxyhydroxides ensures exposed sites and better charge transfer assisted by highly conductive carbon nanomaterial substrate.

In summary, we investigated morphology control of metal borides by simply selecting appropriate metal salts in aqueous solution. In an effort to boost the water oxidation performance, the iron doping and hybridization of metal borides with CNTs were found to be efficient methods. Owing to the in situ transformation of metal boride to corresponding metal oxyhydroxides during water oxidation operation, the as-prepared materials showed superior activity. The optimized hybrid of ΣFe/(Fe+Co) = 0.3 showed superior activity compared to the other Fe/CO ratio, binary iron- or cobalt boride, and IrO2, with a small overpotential (ca. 265 mV), low Tafel slope (ca 30 mV dec<sup>−</sup>1), and enhanced stability. Its excellent performance was attributed to its unique morphological and structural features, a synergetic effect, and better charge transfer.

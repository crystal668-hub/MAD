Herein, a sandwich-like hybrid that comprises a cobalt–iron alloy core coated with porous N-doped carbon shells (CoFe@NC) anchored on wrinkled reduced graphene oxide (rGO) sheets is synthesized by the one-step in situ pyrolysis of a metal organic framework. The optimized sandwich-like CoFe@NC/rGO achieves superior OER activity, requires a low overpotential of 278 mV to drive 10 mA cm $^{-2}$  and maintains a robust durability. The excellent OER performance is ascribed to the 3D sandwich-like architecture, strongly anchored alloy and N-doped carbon shell, and abundant mesopores, which can enable fast electron transfer, ion diffusion, and  $O_2$  release.

The high-efficiency energy conversion and storage systems, such as rechargeable metal-air batteries and solar/electricitydriven water splitting, urgently need the development and application of high-performance electrocatalysts. 1-3 Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) for these electrocatalysts is important because it needs a higher driving overpotential due to the sluggish kinetics of four electron and proton transfer steps.<sup>4</sup> The application of the state-of-the-art noble metal-based catalysts (e.g. Ru, Ir, and their oxides) is also restricted due to their scarcity and high cost. Thus, it is of urgent importance to develop alternative and efficient anode catalysts to accelerate the OER kinetics. Currently, lots of 3d-row transition metal compounds, including oxides/hydroxides,<sup>5-8</sup> chalcogenides,<sup>9,10</sup> free metal,<sup>11</sup> phosphides, 12,13 and alloy nanoparticles, 14,15 have been developed and designed for electrocatalyzing water oxidation. The modulation of the structures and compositions plays an important role in enhancing the activity and durability of non-noble metal-based catalysts. With the use of 2D/3D conductive carbon substrates, such as rGO sheets, carbon nanotubes (CNTs), and carbon shells, the electron transfer and charge rearrangement ability of electrocatalysts can be enhanced and the carbon substrate can prevent active nanomaterials from falling off during the operation. 16,17 For example, single layer graphene encapsulated FeNi alloy coupling with CNTs promoted the electron transfer from the encapsulated metals to the graphene surface.<sup>14</sup> The formation of a 3D conductive network consisting of Ni nanoparticles and N-doped graphene can enhance OER activity.<sup>18</sup> However, the detailed interactions between metal/metal oxide and carbon have not been explored thoroughly. Further enhancement of the electrochemical performance for OER needs more rational and clever design tricks.

Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) are good precursors/templates to form specific composites, including alloys (or metal oxides) and carbon, owing to the coexistence of metal, C, N or S in one compound.<sup>19</sup> Prussian blue analogues, one kind of MOF, can create carbon-confined 3d-metal alloy nanomaterials for HER<sup>20,21</sup> and OER by *in situ* annealing.<sup>16</sup> The recent studies also point out that carbon-confined NiFe nanoparticles possess excellent OER performance due to multi-compositional synergism from the *in situ* annealing of NiFe MOFs.<sup>22,23</sup> However, how the interactions between the metal alloy and carbon affect the performance remains to be further clarified.

Herein, we prepared a sandwich-like CoFe@NC/rGO *via* the one-step annealing treatment of as-obtained MOF precursors of Co<sub>2</sub>[Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub>] and graphene oxide (GO). Such microstructure shows high electrical conductivity due to the formation of a 3D conductive network and enhances the running stability of the catalyst. Scheme 1 shows the synthesis process of CoFe@NC/rGO. In this hybrid, the 3D conductive network (as an electron collector) assembled by CoFe@NC and rGO sheets favors the electron transfer between them. Besides, the N-doped carbon shells in CoFe@NC served as a 'glue' to strongly anchor the CoFe alloy with the wrinkled rGO sheets, which is apt to expose more active sites of the core–shell nanospheres, enlarge the electron transfer capacity, and ensure their stability.

The phase purities of Co<sub>2</sub>[Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub>]/GO and CoFe@NC/rGO were measured by X-ray diffraction (XRD), as depicted in Fig. 1a. The Co<sub>2</sub>[Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub>]/GO sample possesses five main characteristic peaks located at 17.6, 24.9, 35.4, 39.5, and 43.5°,

Two characteristic peaks for the sandwich-like CoFe@NC/rGO located at 44.9° and 66.5° are closely consistent with the (110) and (200) diffraction planes of the cobalt-iron alloy (CoFe, PDF No. 49-1568). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to show the morphology of CoCF/GO and CoFe@NC/rGO. As shown in Fig. 1b, S1b and S1a,† Co<sub>2</sub>[Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub>]/GO is transformed into a sandwich-like architecture after annealing, which consists of uniform nanospheres and rGO sheets. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images (Fig. 1c and S2†) also confirm the uniform structural features of CoFe@NC/rGO, while CoFe nanoalloys are closely encapsulated in carbon shells. As shown in Fig. 1d, the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image clearly shows a carbon-confined CoFe alloy sphere with a porous carbon shell. Fig. 1e and f show the lattice fringes with d-spacings of 0.201 and 0.340 nm assigned to the (110) diffraction plane of the CoFe alloy and the (200) diffraction plane of carbon, respectively, which are consistent with the XRD results. Fig. 1g shows a STEM image of one core-shell CoFe@NC nanosphere. The metallic Co and Fe form a homogeneous nanoalloy core without the presence of phase segregation (Fig. 1h and i); the carbon elements (Fig. 1j) are derived from rGO sheets and carbon shells; and the nitrogen elements (Fig. 1k) are concentrated in the carbon shells. The CoFe@NC sample and rGO sheets were also synthesized and their structure analysis results are provided in Fig. S1(c and d) and S2a.†

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurement was conducted to further investigate the surface chemical composition and element valence. Fig. 2a shows the XPS survey spectrum of the sandwich-like CoFe@NC/rGO. Specifically, the corresponding high-resolution XPS Co and Fe 2p spectra (Fig. 2b and c) contain  $2p_{1/2}$  and  $2p_{3/2}$  parts due to spin-orbit splitting. For Co 2p<sub>3/2</sub>, the peak is located at 782.5 eV, which represents the Co2+ species.20 Similarly, the two peaks of Fe

 $2p_{3/2}$  at 709.1 and 712.9 eV are assigned to the Fe<sup>2+</sup> and Fe<sup>3+</sup> species, respectively. 15,24 The high valence metal can originate from the surface metal-oxygen species via a partial-chargetransfer activation effect between the alloy and the carbon shell.<sup>23</sup> The O 1s spectrum (Fig. 2d) is deconvoluted into four peaks located at 529.9 eV for the oxygen atoms in the metaloxygen species, at 531.4 eV for the oxygen in the defective sites, at 532.4 eV for the oxygen of the functional groups (e.g. C=O and C-O-C) within the carbon shell or rGO sheets, and at 533.9 eV for the absorption of H<sub>2</sub>O.<sup>24</sup> The above results confirm that the metal-oxygen species were created on the surface of the CoFe core, which is possibly due to the stronger interactions of the alloy species with the oxygen-containing groups in the carbon shell. The formation of a chemical bond between the metal and oxygen can affect their physical-chemical properties. 25-28

The OER catalytic performances of as-synthesized CoFe@NC/rGO nanomaterials were studied using a three-electrode cell in 1.0 M KOH aqueous solution at room temperature. Fig. 3a shows the polarization curves of various samples. The sandwich-like CoFe@NC/rGO presents the highest activity with the requirement of the lowest overpotential of 278 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, surpassing RuO<sub>2</sub> (317 mV) and CoFe@NC (360 mV). Besides, the OER catalytic activity of

the sandwich-like CoFe@NC/rGO can also compare favorably with some reported alloys and/or hybrids, such as FeNi LDH,8 FeNi@NC/CNTs,14 NiFe@NC,15 NiCo/PFC,16 Ni<sub>2</sub>Co<sub>1</sub>@Ni<sub>2</sub>Co<sub>1</sub>O<sub>x</sub>, <sup>29</sup> CCS Ni-Co NWs, <sup>30</sup> CoNi(20:1)-P-NS, <sup>31</sup> FeCoMo, 32 Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/rGO, 33 FeCoNi, 34 Ni-Co mixed oxides, 35 and Ni-P, 36 as shown in Table S1† and Fig. 3b. The corresponding Tafel plots also indicate that the sandwich-like CoFe@NC/rGO supports the fastest OER kinetics (Fig. 3c) among all samples tested.

The electrochemical active surface area of the catalyst was estimated from the double-layer capacitance  $(C_{dl})$  determined from the CV curves at different scan rates at a potential range of 0-0.1 V vs. SCE (Fig. S3†). The large active surface areas can produce high  $C_{\rm dl}$  values. <sup>6,37,38</sup> As shown in Fig. 3d,  $C_{\rm dl}$  can be determined as half of the gradient of  $\Delta i$  extracted from the CV curves vs. the scan rate. The CoFe@NC/rGO catalyst displayed the highest double layer capacitance of 51 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>, confirming that it has the highest electrochemical active surface area. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) shows that the sandwich-like CoFe@NC/rGO has the lowest charge transfer and contact impedance (Fig. 3e and f), which can enhance the electron transfer ability. The 3D conductive network consisting of rGO and a carbon shell indeed enhances the conductivity of the catalysts.

To explore the reasons for the superior catalytic performance of the sandwich-like hybrid, we studied the annealed Co<sub>2</sub>[Fe (CN)<sub>6</sub>]/GO samples at different annealing temperatures. The polarization curves demonstrate that the OER performance of the sandwich-like CoFe@NC/rGO obtained at 800 °C is superior to those of other catalysts obtained by annealing at 600, 700, and 900 °C (Fig. S4†). High annealing temperatures did not trigger the phase transformation and shift (Fig. S2b†). Raman spectroscopy (Fig. 4a) was then conducted to prove the behaviors of the D (1350 cm<sup>-1</sup>) and G bands (1580 cm<sup>-1</sup>) of the rGO sheets and/or carbon shells. The lower  $I_D/I_G$  intensity ratio suggests that the sandwich-like CoFe@NC/rGO possesses a higher graphitization degree<sup>20</sup> and lesser defect numbers,<sup>21</sup> thus leading to the lower resistivity.<sup>39</sup> Table S2† shows the conductivity data from the four point probe measurement of different annealing samples. The conductivity increases from 6.43 to 92.85 S cm<sup>-1</sup> with the increase of the annealing temperature from 600 to 900 °C. With the increase of the annealing temperature, the  $I_D/I_G$  ratios and resistivities of CoFe@NC/rGO decrease, indicating that high annealing temperatures are favorable to obtain low-defect rGO and superior conductivity. High conductivity often results in a low overpotential and fast OER.

In order to find the detailed reason, TEM, SEM, BET and TGA were performed. Fig. 4b-d and S5† show that the sizes of the nanoparticles decrease with the increase of the annealing temperature and carbon-confined CoFe core-shell spheres were clearly observed at higher annealing temperatures. Fig. 4e shows a schematic of different sandwich-like structures formed at different annealing temperatures. The N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms (Fig. S6a-d†) were further studied to estimate the surface area and pore size distribution of CoFe@NC/rGO at different annealing temperatures. As shown

Fig. 4 (a) Raman spectra, (b-d) TEM images of the sandwich-like CoFe@NC/rGO prepared at different annealing temperatures: (b) 600, (c) 700 and (d) 900 °C, and (e) schematic diagrams of different sandwich-like structures

in Table S3,† compared to the lower annealing temperatures (600 and 700 °C), the sandwich-like CoFe@NC/rGO annealed at 800 and 900 °C have a larger surface area because the production of new mesopores stemmed from the further pyrolysis of CoFe@NC/rGO. Therefore, CoFe@NC/rGO obtained at 800 and 900 °C has a lower overpotential than that obtained at 600 and 700 °C. According to Raman spectroscopy, conductivity and BET results, CoFe@NC/rGO obtained at 900 °C should have a lower overpotential than that obtained at 800 °C. However, CoFe@NC/rGO obtained at 800 °C displays the lowest overpotential. As shown in Fig. S6c and d,† compared with 800 °C, the sandwich-like CoFe@NC/rGO at 900 °C lose the 5 nm mesopores, which may be bad for the absorption of OH on active sites and/or the release of O2. The TGA curve (Fig. S7†) shows an obvious weight loss around 800 °C. From 850-1000 °C, a steady weight loss occurs. Further annealing treatment can enable the repair of the carbon defect, which also induces a loss of some active sites.

This intensive OER performance for the sandwich-like CoFe@NC/rGO can be thus attributed to the following factors: (a) building the 3D sandwich-like architecture exposes the most active sites and offers a lower charge-transfer impedance; (b) generating N-doped carbon shell favors the electron transfer from wrinkled rGO sheets to the surface of the CoFe alloy; and (c) forming the dispersive and uniform core-shell nanospheres with abundant mesopores facilitates the absorption of OH and/or the release of O<sub>2</sub> on the active sites.

The stability of the sandwich-like CoFe@NC/rGO was evaluated by cyclic voltammetry and i-t measurement. As shown

Fig. 5 Long-term stability of the CoFe@NC/rGO: (a) OER polarization curves before and after 1000 cycles; (b) i-t testing curve at an overpotential of 280 mV.

in Fig. 5a, the overpotential of the sandwich-like CoFe@NC/ rGO remains constant initially and after 1000 cycles. As shown in Fig. 5b, the current density of the sandwich-like CoFe@NC/rGO at an overpotential of 280 mV can remain at around 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> before and after running 8 h, while the CoFe@NC free sample shows a sharp degradation (Fig. S8a†). Furthermore, the i-t testing of the sandwich-like CoFe@NC/rGO at overpotentials of 320 and 350 mV also displays OER durability, as shown in Fig. S8b.† Both CV and i-t testing confirm that the sandwich-like CoFe@NC/rGO offers more durable stability. During OER, the catalyst is under an oxidation electrical field; thus the in situ produced M-O(OH) can be found on the surface of the CoNi alloy. Phase transformation from CoFe to CoFeOOH may occur, while Fe incorporation promotes the conversion of Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> into CoOOH.39

#### Conclusions

In summary, the metal-organic-framework derived sandwichlike CoFe@NC/rGO achieves superior OER activity and durability. The excellent OER performance originates from the 3D sandwich-like architecture, facile electron transfer between CoFe@NC and wrinkled rGO sheets, and formation of dispersive and uniform core-shell nanospheres with abundant mesopores. Our work provides a general strategy to design and modulate the structure of the metal and the conducting agent for high-performance electrocatalysts using water splitting and rechargeable metal-air batteries.

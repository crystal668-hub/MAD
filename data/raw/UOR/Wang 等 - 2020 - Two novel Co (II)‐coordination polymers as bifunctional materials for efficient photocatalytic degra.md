The investigation of the photo-degradation methyl blue and methyl violet (MB, MV) properties of CPs 1–2 demonstrates that CP 1 shows great performance for the degradation of MB, and CP 2 could efficiently degrade MB/MV. Meanwhile, the possible photo-degradation mechanism has been proposed and explored. Simultaneously, electrochemistry studies show that both CPs 1 and 2 can catalyze water oxidation under an alkaline condition at the potential around 1.20 V vs. NHE with relatively low overpotential of 330–510 mV vs. NHE.

### 1 | INTRODUCTION

Coordination polymers (CPs) are composed of organic linkers and inorganic metal ions.<sup>[1]</sup> Current research on CPs has focused on ordered crystal states, noncrystalline or amorphous MOFs are attracting attention for applications in, e.g., ion conductivity and molecular encapsulation.<sup>[2]</sup> Due to their adjustable porous structure, large surface area<sup>[3]</sup> and ease of preparation,<sup>[4]</sup> CPs have been widely used in many fields such as gas adsorption and separation,<sup>[5]</sup> luminescence,<sup>[6]</sup> magnetism,<sup>[7]</sup> sensing,<sup>[8]</sup> and catalysis.<sup>[9]</sup>

Emissions of hard-dealt organic wastewater generated in the textile, paper, and plastic industries affect both

human health and the ecological environment, as well as the shortage of freshwater resources. [10] Therefore, adsorption, [11] flocculation, [12] methods such as ultrafiltration,[13] biodegradation, [14] ozonation,[15] photocatalysis, [16] etc. are widely used to exclude organic dyes from wastewater. In recent years, photocatalytic degrading dyes in wastewater has received extensive attention.<sup>[17]</sup> Moreover, future energy supplies are bound to shift to clean energy, [18] and electrochemical decomposition of water to produce hydrogen is considered one of the most promising ways to get clean energy from renewable sources.<sup>[19]</sup> As a half-reaction of splitting water,<sup>[20]</sup> water oxidation, could produce electrons and protons for H<sub>2</sub> evolution, which is considered as a vital part for this

reaction. [21] However, in previous research, most effective catalysts for OER (oxygen evolution reaction) are precious metals based CPs such as Ir, Ru CPs, etc. [22] But because precious metal electrocatalysts are not conducive to large-scale production applications, development of non-precious metal-based catalysts has become the current focus. [23] In addition, the overpotentials of heterogeneous electrocatalytic water oxidation by non-precious metal CPs are generally high. [24] Moreover, the overpotentials for some CPs such as cobalt-based materials also very high. [25] Therefore, designing and synthesizing inexpensive, stable and effective electrocatalysts remains a huge challenge.

For the reasons above, herein, we report the synthesis and structures of two new CPs, namely [Co (bcpo) $_{0.5}$ (tib)  $(H_2O)_2]_n$  and [Co (bcpo) $_{0.5}$ (bidpe) $(H_2O)_2]_n$  (bcpo = 2,5-bis(4-carboxylpheny)-1,3,4-oxadiazole, tib = 1,3,5-tirs(1-imidazolyl)benzene, bidpe = 4,4'-bis (imidazolyl)diphenyl ether). The photodegradation capability of dyes and electrocatalytic reactivity for water oxidation of CPs **1–2** have been also thoroughly investigated.

# 2.1 | Materials and physical measurements

All reagents and solvents were purchased from Jinan Henghua Sci. & Tec. Co. Ltd, and were used without further purification. Chemicals used were: 2,5-bis(4carboxylpheny)-1,3,4-oxadiazole, 1,3,5-tirs(1-imidazolyl) benzene, 4,4'-bis (imidazolyl) diphenyl ether. Infrared spectra were tested on the Nicolet 170SX spectrometer in the 4000-400 cm<sup>-1</sup>. Region by using KBr pellets. Elemental analyses of C, H, N were performed in a model 2400 Perkin-Elmer analyzer. TG analyses were measured on a PerkinElmer TGA-7 thermogravimetric analyzer under nitrogen conditions from room temperature to 900 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C·min<sup>-1</sup>. The X-ray power diffractions (PXRD) were collected on an Enraf-Nonius CAD-4 X-ray single crystal diffractometer with Cu-Kα radiation. Topological analysis was performed and confirmed by the Topos program and the Systre software.

properties of CPs 1-2 in an alkaline condition is Linear Sweep Voltammetry (LSV), which was carried out in a single-chamber three-electrode electrolytic cell in which Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl solution) was used as a reference electrode; a platinum wire electrode was used as a counter electrode; a F-doped tin oxide (FTO) conducting glass substrates (1 cm  $\times$  1 cm, active surface area was 1.0 cm<sup>2</sup>) was used as a working electrode (The working electrode should be washed alternately with absolute ethanol and deionized water, and dried); 0.1 mol·L<sup>-1</sup> of NaOAc was used as the electrolyte solution. Controlled-potential electrolysis (CPE) were performed with FTO glass electrode as the working electrode, which was obtained from Zhuhai Kaivo Optoelectronic Corp. They were pretreated by dipping it in 5 wt% NaOAc in ethanol for several hours, then cleaning with water, ethanol, and water successively, and dried. A mixture of CP 1-2 (10 mg) and 3-4 drops of Nafion-ethanol (v/v = 1:9) was placed in a centrifuge tube, sonicated for 30 min, then applied to the FTO glass electrode surface. Before each experiment the

solution was purged with high purity argon for 30 min. All the tests were carried out at room temperature. An Ocean Optics NeoFox-GT oxygen probe was adopted to quantify the generated oxygen concentration in the solution and in the headspace. However, after electrolysis, the concentration of headspace oxygen was below the detection limit of the sensor.

## 3.1 | Structure description

## 3.1.1 | Structure description of 1

Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis result shows that **1** crystallizes in orthorhombic space group  $Pca2_1$ . The asymmetric unit contains one Co (II) center, a half bcpo ligand, a tib ligand and two water molecules. There is also a free acetonitrile molecule in the structure. The

bond lengths of the Co-O bond and the Co-N bond are 2.048(4)-2.152(3) Å and 2.120(3)-2.136(4) Å, respectively. Each Co (II) center is in six-coordinate mode, forming an octahedron coordination geometry, three oxygen atoms (O1, O2 and O3) from two individual water molecules and a bcpo ligand, and three N atoms (N1, N4a and N6) from three individual tib ligands (Figure 1a). The bond angles around Co (II) ions range from 80.10(14) to 178.11 (15)-. Each tib ligand is linked to its adjacent six tib ligands by three Co (II) ions to form a reticulated 2D planar structure, and the bcpo ligand is suspended from the network by Co (II) ions (Figure 1b). Topologically, the framework of 1 could be simplified as a 6-connected net with the point symbol of[9c] which belongs to the hxl topology (Figure 1c).

# 3.1.2 | Structure description of 2

Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis result shows that 2 crystallizes in orthorhombic space group Pca21. The asymmetric unit contains a Co (II) center, a bcpo ligand, two bidp ligands and two water molecules. There are also three free water molecules in the structure. The bond lengths of the Co-O bond and the Co-N bond are 2.063 (4)-2.228(3) Å and 2.068(4)-2.090(4) Å, respectively. Each Co (II) center is a six-coordinate mode, forming an octahedron coordination geometry, passing through four oxygen atoms from two individual water molecules and a bcpo ligand, and two N atoms from two individual bidp ligands, the disordered atoms are also delete (Figure 2a). The bond angles around Co (II) ions range from 59.83 (11) to 174.25(13)-. The bidp ligand and the bcpo ligand are sequentially linked by Co (II) ions and have a 1D chain structure (Figure 2b).

# 3.2 | Thermal analyses

To examine the thermal stability of CPs <sup>1</sup>–2, TG curves are shown in Figure S1. The samples were heated up to 900 -C in a N2 atmosphere with a heating rate of 10 -C·min−<sup>1</sup> . The TG curve indicates that 1 loses weight

gradually from 30 °C to 175 °C, which could belong to the volatilization of acetonitrile molecules and coordination water molecules in the crystal lattice (calc.15.40%). The whole structure starts to collapse at ca. 340 °C as a result of the thermal decomposition and the remaining residue is CoO. As for **2**, it loses weight at 30 °C–150 °C, which may be caused by the volatilization of the coordination water molecule. When the temperature reaches 350 °C, the organic ligands begin to decompose. The total mass loss is 91.0%, which is approximately equivalent to the removal of organic matter (calc. 90.1%).

## 3.3 | Photocatalytic properties

The specific steps of the photocatalytic experiment were as follows: 10 mg of 1 or 2 were dispersed in 50 ml of MB (6 mg·L $^{-1}$ ) and MV (6 mg·L $^{-1}$ ) solutions (MB = Methylene blue, MV = Methyl violet), respectively. The mixture was stirred in the dark for 30 min

until the equilibrium of adsorption and desorption was reached, and then the Hg lamp (125 W) was turned on. After centrifuging the sample, took the supernatant for UV test.

As shown in Figure 3a, the photocatalytic ability of 1 for MV degradation was relatively low with a rate of 55.3% in 120 min by UV irradiation, whereas 1 showed significant photocatalytic ability for MB degradation (Figure 3b), with a degradation rate of 91.0% in 120 min Compared with some reported MOFs based photocatalysts, such as ZnO@ZIF-8,[27] CP 1 also has advantages. The same amount of photocatalyst (10.0 mg) has similar degradation effect in a shorter time. While the degradation rate of 2 for MV and MB in 120 min is as high as 73.7% and 79.1% (Figure 3c-3e, respectively). The photocatalytic studies indicate that 1 can be a good candidate for the photocatalytic degradation of MB. In order to study the stability of CPs 1-2 for ultraviolet photocatalytic degradation of MB and MV, the solid powder samples were collected by centrifugation after the

corresponding experiments, and PXRD tests were performed. From Figure S2, we can see that the structures of CPs **1–2** do not change significantly before and after the ultraviolet photocatalytic reaction, which could prove the two CPs are stable catalysts.

# 3.4 | Degradation mechanism

The photocatalytic mechanism<sup>[28]</sup> can be explained by the fact that when a semiconductor is exposed to as many photons with energy larger than the forbidden band width energy, electrons can transit from the valence band (VB) to the conduction band (CB), generating electronhole pairs (h<sup>+</sup>-e<sup>-</sup>). As for transition metal CP, the corresponding process can be described as transferring an electron from the highest occupied orbit (HOMO) to the lowest unoccupied orbital (LUMO) of the central metal ion when irradiated with ultraviolet light. This process is

called OMCT, i.e. charge transfers from the 2p orbital of the oxygen to the d orbital of central metal ion. The HOMO orbital that loses electrons needs an electron to return to its steady state, so it continues to react with oxygen or water molecules to generate a large number of free radicals. The free radicals that normally present as a catalyst are  $\cdot$ OH and  $\cdot$ O<sup>2-</sup>. These free radicals can effectively destroy organic dyes during the photocatalytic process. As for CPs 1 and 2, the corresponding process could be described as transferring an electron from the highest occupied orbit (HOMO) to the lowest unoccupied orbital (LUMO) of the central metal Co (II) ion when irradiated with ultraviolet light. This process is called OMCT, i.e. charge transfers from the 2p orbital of the coordinated oxygen atom to the d orbital of central Co (II) ion. The HOMO orbital that loses electrons needs an electron to return to its steady state, so it continues to react with oxygen or water molecules to generate a large number of free radicals. The free radicals that normally present as a

catalyst are  $\cdot$ OH and  $\cdot$ O<sup>2-</sup>. These free radicals can effectively destroy organic dyes during the photocatalytic process.

In order to confirm the proposed mechanism, we carried out a free radical trapping experiment to detect the main oxide species in the photocatalytic process, <sup>[28]</sup> while, isopropanol (IPA) as a capture agent for the ·OH radical was added to the reaction solution. As shown in the Figure 4, after adding IPA, the photocatalytic effect of 1 on both MB and MV dyes is significantly inhibited, after photocatalytic degradation for 120 min, the degradation rate decreases by 62.5% and 20.2%, respectively. The degradation rate of 2 decreases by 24.4% and 38.0%, respectively. These results indicate that ·OH radical is the main active substance in the photocatalytic reaction system.

# 3.5 | Electrochemical water oxidation catalytic studies

In order to investigate the electrochemistry water oxidation reactivity of CPs 1 and 2, linear scan voltammetry (LSV) were recorded in 1.0 M sodium acetate buffer solution prepared by distilled water over the pH values range of 9.45–11.98 at the scan rate of 100 mV·s<sup>-1</sup> (Figure 5). The current values rise up at the potential of about

1.10 V (all potentials vs. NHE) for both CPs 1 and 2 with the pH increase 9.45-11.98. In addition, many oxygen bubbles produced at this point are observed on the FTO electrode surface (Figure S3), which is detected by an Ocean Optics NeoFox-GT oxygen sensor. All of these suggest that the two complexes can catalyze water oxidation around 1.10 V. Besides, the onset potentials of catalytic water oxidation for both CPs 1 and 2 show linear pH dependences with the slopes of  $-41 \text{ mV} \cdot \text{pH}^{-1}$  (1) and  $-48 \text{ mV} \cdot \text{pH}^{-1}$  (2), respectively, indicating that it could be a PCET (proton-coupled electron transfer) electrocatalytic process for 1 and 2. Moreover, the electrocatalytic process for the two complexes were also investigated at the scan rates of 20, 60, 100, 200 and 300 mV·s<sup>-1</sup>, which reveals good linear relationships between the peak currents at 1.2 V with the square root of scan speeds (Figure 6) indicates that the processes for 1 and 2 are both diffusion controlled.

Based on the half peak potential of the CVs defined by equation 7 and 8, the overpotentials ( $\eta$ ) for **1** and **2** where the electrocatalytic water oxidation happens in the pH range of 9.45–11.98 are at 330–510 mV, which is relatively low compared to other reported Co-based materials (Table S3).

To assess the electrocatalytic activity of CPs 1-2 for water oxidation, controlled potential electrocatalysis (CPE) experiments were employed at the potential of 1.2~V and pH=11.98 in a gas-tight cell under the same condition with the electrocatalytic CV measurements. Meanwhile, for verifying and quantifying the generated oxygen, the oxygen concentration in the solution was recorded in situ by the oxygen sensor (The concentration of the headspace oxygen was below the detection limit of the sensor.) with CP 1 or 2 in the system. Over an electrolysis period of 30 min at the applied potential of 1.2~V,

it can be seen from the Figure 7a that the detected dissolved  $O_2$  concentration got to 147.2  $\mu M$  and 286.6  $\mu M$ . As shown in Figure 7b, the current density for CPs 1 and 2 are 1.63 mA·cm<sup>-2</sup> and 2.25 mA·cm<sup>-2</sup>, respectively, suggesting that CPs 1–2 are the potential electrocatalysts for water oxidation under these situations. The current densities for CPs 1–2 are both stabilized during 30 min electrolysis period, indicating that catalysts 1 and 2 remained stable in solution throughout the catalytic process.

### 4 | CONCLUSIONS

In summary, two novel coordination polymers [Co  $(bcpo)_{0.5}(tib)(H_2O)_2]_n$  (1), [Co  $(bcpo)_{0.5}(bidpe)$  $(H_2O)_2|_{n}$  (2) were synthesized under solvothermal conditions. Structural differences in CPs 1-2 indicate that nitrogen-donor ligands play an important role in the coordination mode and in the final structure. 1 shows high-efficiency degradation of MB under UV irradiation. 2 displays efficient photodegradation of MV/MB. The mechanism research indicates that the main active component is •OH. It can be concluded that CPs 1-2 can be used as potential photocatalysts. Electrochemical studies show that CPs 1-2 can both catalyze water oxidation at the low overpotential of 330-510 mV in an alkaline system. Therefore, CPs 1-2 not only exhibits potential photocatalytic prospects, but can also be used as an excellent water oxidation electrocatalyst.

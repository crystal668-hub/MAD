**Urea electrolysis can convert urea from urea-rich wastewater to hydrogen for environmental protection and sustainable energy production. However, the sluggish kinetics of urea oxidation reaction (UOR) requires valence-variable sites that are generally active at high anodic overpotentials. Herein, a robust ceramic coating is constructed with coupled tungsten nitride (WN)/nickel carbide (Ni3C) nanoparticles to achieve valence-stable catalytic sites with outstanding UOR performance. Various characterization results indicate strong interfacial electron transfer from WN to Ni3C in coupled nanoparticles, which enables reservation of Ni2<sup>+</sup> sites without self-oxidation during UOR, quite distinct from the kinetically slow Ni3<sup>+</sup>OOH-catalyzed UOR pathway. Theoretical calculations show that the coupled effect in WN/Ni3C leads to enhanced electron transfer from catalytic sites to adsorbed urea, and W sites are thermodynamically favorable for UOR. This efficiently lowers the barrier of rate-determining step (RDS: \*CO-N2** → **\*CO·OH), thus enabling fast UOR kinetics and a low potential of 1.336 V at 100 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2, which identifies this ceramic coating as one of the best UOR electrocatalysts. This work opens a new avenue for design of stable and active sites in ceramics coatings toward advanced electrocatalytic applications.**

**1. Introduction**

Ceramic coatings, existing on the surface of substate, have been employed to enhance the wear resistance, thermostability, and corrosion resistance, while maintaining the structural strength of the substate materials.[1] They are composed of a vast array of inorganic nonmetallic materials, such as oxides,[2] carbides,[1a] and nitrides,[3] possessing the thickness of *<*1 mm. The utilization of ceramics as heterogeneous catalysts and catalytic supports becomes a burgeoning research topic. The modification of chemical reactivity of ceramics coatings is expected to enhance the interaction with adsorbed reactive species, thus improving the activity and stability of ceramics catalysts. Especially, the compositions and defect structures are of crucial importance in determining catalytic activity and selectivity, and surface redox behavior.[4] The practical ceramic catalysts are typically complex compounds containing at least two different cations, which offer enormous compositional flexibility and potential catalytic properties.[5]

Among many ceramic materials, Wand Ni-based ceramics exhibit promising activity and structure stability in the field of catalysis, especially under harsh conditions.[6] A new-type Ni-W composite coating reinforced by introducing ceramic nanoparticles (ZrO2, TiN, BN, and Si3N4)

has been reported to optimize the corrosion-resistant and antiwear capability of the electrode.[7] A nanocomposite with a minor NiO phase on the major perovskite surface, was also used as cathode of protonic ceramic fuel cell with high power density and excellent stability.[8] The major perovskite phase promotes the proton conduction, while NiO boosts surface oxygen exchange process. Moreover, W- or Ni-based ceramics show a high photocatalytic activity toward removal of organic molecules. For example, MnWO4 nanostructures as photocatalytic substances, manifest high removal rate and good stability to eliminate organic contamination in 50 min under visible radiation during the photocatalytic process.[9] Porous CoxNi1-xTiO3 ceramics nanorods show nearly complete degradation (92%) of ethyl paraben after 5 h solar irradiation.[10] Inspired by the interaction of ceramic materials with organic contaminants,[11] rational design of advanced ceramic coating materials to catalyze the oxidation reaction of urea molecules,[12] could lower the overpotential and energy input, further producing economic benefits during the purification of wastewater enriched with urea.[13]

Urea oxidation reaction (UOR, CO(NH2)2 + 6OH<sup>−</sup> → N2 + CO2 + 5H2O + 6e<sup>−</sup>) has been regarded as an important alternative to oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in green H2 production via electrocatalytic water splitting, owing to considerably low thermodynamic equilibrium potential (0.37 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)). During the UOR, the bonds formed between transition metal sites and oxygen have been reported to promote the adsorption of OH<sup>−</sup>, and thus optimizing the kinetics of UOR due to the electron-withdrawing ability of metal sites. Ni-based materials such as Ni0.9Fe0.1Ox and NiWO4 have been reported as candidates to catalyze the UOR. Usually, they could undergo a self-oxidation process to grow up Ni<sup>3</sup><sup>+</sup>OOH species as the catalytic sites. In contrast, a distinctive situation is that Ni<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> and other elements cooperate to catalyze the UOR process. A typical example is the intermediate ammonia production with the UOR on Ni2Fe(CN)6. The Ni2<sup>+</sup> sites and adjacent Fe sites in Ni2Fe(CN)6 could cooperatively promote the decomposition of intermediate ammonia to N2. However, the activity and stability of single component Ni-based electrocatalysts toward UOR are still poor. Therefore, it is highly desirable and possible to accurately design composite components of ceramic materials with rich interfaces to achieve high catalytic activity and structural stability toward UOR.

Herein, we construct a structural ceramic coating enriched with coupled WN and Ni3C hetero-nanoparticles (WN/Ni3C) on Ni foam through a high-temperature pyrolysis route, showing outstanding activity and long-term stability for UOR due to protection and stabilization of active sites in structural ceramics coatings. The electrochemical test confirms the as-prepared WN/Ni3C ceramics coating only needs 1.315 and 1.336 V to achieve the current density of 10 and 100 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2, respectively, superior to the state-of-the-art Ni-based electrocatalysts toward UOR at present. Various in situ and ex situ characterizations show the electron transfer at the hetero-structured interface from WN to Ni3C nanocomponents could stabilize Ni2<sup>+</sup> sites without self-oxidation to Ni<sup>3</sup><sup>+</sup>, thus optimizing the binding energy of urea molecule adsorbing on the electrocatalyst. Theoretical calculation indicates that urea could be adsorbed at W site during the process of UOR, and the constant valence of Ni2<sup>+</sup> promotes the activity of W sites. The synergistic interaction between two nanocomponents in this ceramic coating optimizes the process of adsorption, activation, and oxidation of urea. This work enlightens the design and practical applications of electrocatalysts based on advanced ceramics coatings.

### **2. Results**

#### **2.1. Synthesis and Structural Characterization of WN/Ni3C Ceramic Coatings and Control Samples**

Schematic illustration of synthesizing NiWOx and WN/Ni3C coating is shown in **Figure 1**a. NiWOx oxide coating was prepared on nickel foam (NF) by a hydrothermal method. The transformation of NiWOx to WN/Ni3C ceramic coating was performed by pyrolysis with urea as carbon and nitrogen source. As shown in Figure 1b, the XRD peaks of NiWOx are well assigned to Ni4W6O21(OH)2·4H2O phase (PDF#47-0143). After pyrolysis of NiWOx with urea, the resulting ceramic coating contains two phases, that is, WN (PDF#75-1012) and Ni3C (PDF#06-0697). The utilization of a single precursor of Ni and W results in the formation of the WN/Ni3C nanocomposite with expectable coupling effect. Furthermore, pure WN and N3C were also prepared as the reference electrocatalysts to highlight the advantages of coupled WN/Ni3C nanoparticles in ceramics coating toward the UOR over single-phase materials.

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) reveals the thickness and morphology of NiWOx and WN/Ni3C ceramics coatings. As shown in Figure 1c, the resulting NiWOx shows a compact and fracture-free coating with uniform thickness of ≈5.7 μm on NF. Due to the external mechanical force applied for cutting samples, the inevitable gap appears between coating and substrate (Figure S1, Supporting Information). The microstructure of NiWOx oxide coating shows the stacking feature of micro-meter-sized polyhedral particles (Figure 1d). EDS mapping images of NiWOx reveal the uniform distribution of Ni, W, and O with atomic percentage of 20.39, 14.29, and 65.32 at.%, respectively (Figures S2 and S3a, Supporting Information). After pyrolysis of NiWOx with urea, the thickness of WN/Ni3C ceramic coating is slightly lower than that of NiWOx precursor due to ammonia etching at high temperature (Figure 1e). The relatively smooth surface of WN/Ni3C coating is decorated with spherical and worm-like particles (Figure 1f), which is different from that of NiWOx oxide coating. This implies efficient transformation of NiWOx by high-temperature ammonia pyrolysis. EDS mapping images reveal uniform distribution of Ni, C, W, and N elements throughout the WN/Ni3C ceramic coating (Figure 1g). The measured atomic ratio of Ni:W:C:N is 19.27:20.78:25.03:34.92 at%, respectively, except for the existence of tiny oxygen content (Figure S3c, Supporting Information).

The microstructure of pure Ni3C ceramics coating was also analyzed. SEM images shows an interconnected lamellar structure with abundant surface particles in Ni3C coating (Figure S4, Supporting Information). Transmission electron microscope (TEM) image in Figure S5 (Supporting Information) further confirms the layer structure with fine nanoparticles. High-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image reveals that the lattice spacing of Ni3C is 2.09 Å, which is consistent with Ni3C (006) plane and the result of SAED pattern (Figure S5b, Supporting Information). EDS mapping image of Ni3C reveals that Ni, C, O and N are distributed

uniformly (Figure S6, Supporting Information). The atomic ratio of Ni:C:N:O content is 56.77:35.16:6.60:1.46 (Figure S3b, Supporting Information). Interestingly, a small amount of N has been introduced by urea pyrolysis, and the content N of Ni3C is far below that of WN/Ni3C, which gives a strongly evidence that N originating from urea prefers to coordinating with W sites rather than Ni sites. It is worth mentioning that Ni in Ni3C may exist in Ni metal (Ni0), while Ni in WN/Ni3C exists in Ni ions (Figures S3b,c and S6, Supporting Information). The electronegativity of N element is higher than that of O and C element, and the hexavalent W possesses the higher reducibility. It was also reported that W tends to coordinate with N rather than C to form the new compound.[14] The outermost electronic structure of Ni atom is 3d8. The eight unpaired electrons make Ni have the tetrahedral coordination ability to form chemical bonds with four ligands. The binding ability of Ni with C atom mainly depends on small radius of Ni, positive electronegativity, and the flexible va-

lence state. Therefore, when NiWO4 reacted with urea at high temperature, N prefers to coordinate with W rather than Ni, and Ni prefers to be bonded with C to form WN/Ni3C nanocomposites.

The detailed morphology and micro-structure of WN/Ni3C were further revealed by angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (ADF-STEM). As shown in **Figure 2**a, the bright area in the frame line corresponds to WN/Ni3C ceramic particles, which is uniformly distributed on the carbon substrate derived from catalysis growth. Figure 2b corresponds to the enlarged area in the red frame of Figure 2a. The Ni3C nanoparticles with a diameter of 15 nm were coupled to WN with a laminate structure. High magnification ADF image in Figure 2c provides direct evidence to reveal the distinct interface of WN and Ni3C. The clear atomic facets with two orientations are assigned to Ni3C and the lattice spacing of 2.10 Å corresponds to Ni3C (006) plane, while the evident layered

alignment of atoms with a lattice spacing of 2.54 Å is attributed to WN (111) plane. The interface formed between Ni<sub>3</sub>C and WN could generate the interaction and electron transfer between two parts. Electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) of WN/Ni<sub>3</sub>C in Figure 2d–f shows obvious C–K, N–K, Ni–L, and W–M edge, which further demonstrates the high purity of WN/Ni<sub>3</sub>C. Furthermore, the corresponding EDS-mapping images (Figure 2g) also reveal uniform distribution of W, N, Ni, and C in the WN and Ni<sub>3</sub>C components, which demonstrate the ceramic coating composed of coupled WN and Ni<sub>3</sub>C nanoparticles has been synthesized successfully.

#### 2.2. Evaluating the UOR Activity of WN/Ni3C Ceramics Coating

The electrochemical test of these as-synthesized electrocatalysts were measured by using a standard three-electrode method. All the electrochemical curves of OER were evaluated in 1  $\,\mathrm{M}$  KOH electrolyte, while the performance of UOR was recorded in 1  $\,\mathrm{M}$  KOH with 0.33  $\,\mathrm{M}$  urea electrolyte. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of WN/Ni $_3$ C, Ni $_3$ C, and WN at different scan rates were measured in 1  $\,\mathrm{M}$  KOH with 0.33  $\,\mathrm{M}$  urea electrolyte. The logarithm of absolute value of anode peak current ( $j_c$ ) is directly proportional to the logarithm of different scan rates, suggesting

that three electrocatalysts are related to a mixed control of diffusion and capacitive process during the UOR (Figure 3a-c). As shown in Figure 3a-c and Figure S7 (Supporting Information), the results show that WN has a larger slope value (0.730) than WN/Ni<sub>3</sub>C (0.563) and Ni<sub>3</sub>C (0.549), which suggests that WN is beneficial for promoting the diffusion rate during UOR. The reduction peak at  $\approx 1.2$  V was indeed assigned to N<sup>3+</sup> to Ni<sup>2+</sup>. The WN/Ni<sub>3</sub>C structural ceramic coating was formed on the NF. During the electrochemical CV process, the NF substrate could occur partial oxidization. In the cathodic process, the peak located at 1.2 V appears due to the reduction of partially oxidized NF. The double-layer capacitance (C<sub>dl</sub>) of WN/Ni<sub>3</sub>C is 18.4 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>, higher than  $Ni_3C$  (16.3 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>),  $NiWO_x$  (13.2 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>), and WN (1.4 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>). This indicates WN/Ni<sub>3</sub>C has the largest electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) toward UOR (Figures S8 and S9, Supporting Information), which is favorable for the exposure of active sites. It is noteworthy that Ni<sub>3</sub>C also has large C<sub>d1</sub>, only slightly smaller than WN/Ni<sub>3</sub>C, but WN has the smallest value. This suggests that Ni<sub>3</sub>C plays an important role in increasing active sites of WN/Ni<sub>3</sub>C, while WN favors fast diffusion (as illustrated by the slope in Figure 3a-c). WN/Ni<sub>3</sub>C ceramic coating combines the advantages of both components, which would bring out good performance of UOR. In addition, the CV curves with different scan rates of WN/Ni<sub>3</sub>C, Ni<sub>3</sub>C and WN were also

evaluated in O2 saturated 1 m KOH electrolyte (Figure S10, Supporting Information). The logarithm of absolute value for anode peak current (*j* c) is also directly proportional to the logarithm of different scan rates during the OER process (Figure S10, Supporting Information), but the slope for WN/Ni3C is 0.475, higher than those of WN (0.465) and Ni3C (0.431). These values are very close to 0.5, illustrating a diffusion-controlled process. This further confirms that the combination of WN and Ni3C is beneficial for improving the kinetics of OH<sup>−</sup> due to the introduction of W sites.

In order to further evaluate the possibility of UOR substituting for anodic OER toward water splitting, the overpotential at the current density of 50 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> toward UOR and OER was measured by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV). Surprisingly, the potential only requires 1.33 V versus RHE for UOR to achieve the current density of 50 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2, which is 230 mV lower than OER at the same current density (Figure 3d). During the OER process, an obvious self-oxidation peak of Ni2<sup>+</sup>/Ni<sup>3</sup><sup>+</sup> occurs at 1.36 V versus RHE, indicating the generation of high valance Ni<sup>3</sup><sup>+</sup> species. In contrast, during the UOR process, the current density of WN/Ni3C sharply rises at the potential before the occurrence of oxidation of Ni<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup>. This phenomenon provides strong evidence that NiOOH species have not been produced during the UOR process, thus reducing the binding energy of COO\* adsorption at the Ni site. Compared to WN/Ni3C, Ni3C demonstrates slightly decreased UOR activity, which could be caused by abundant Ni2<sup>+</sup> sites but lack of assistance from WN. The polarization curves of WN and NiWOx electrocatalyst appear the obvious oxidation peak, corresponding to oxidation state of Ni<sup>3</sup><sup>+</sup> to catalyze UOR.[15] During the OER and UOR process, both Ni2<sup>+</sup> sites in NiWOx could undergo a self-oxidation process to form Ni<sup>3</sup><sup>+</sup> species as the active sites. Many studies have reported that a competition for adsorption of OH\* at Ni3<sup>+</sup> sites between the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which

gives a current cut-off during the electrocatalytic process. Such competition is essentially ascribed to insufficient surface concentration of Ni $^{3+}$  sites. For WN electrocatalyst, the adsorption of excess urea molecules at W active sites causes insufficient adsorption of OH $^-$  species, which gives a current cut-off during the UOR process (Figure 3e). The polarization curves of WN/Ni $_3$ C and the as-prepared other electrocatalysts without iR-correction in 1  $_{\rm M}$  KOH with 0.33  $_{\rm M}$  urea for UOR, and O $_2$ -saturated 1  $_{\rm M}$  KOH for OER were shown in Figure S11 (Supporting Information), respectively.

In addition, the potential of WN/Ni<sub>3</sub>C to drive the current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> only requires 1.315 V versus RHE, superior to the state-of-the-art electrocatalysts toward UOR reported recently (Figure 3f). We have compared the UOR activity of ceramics coatings with those reported in the literatures. And we summarized the recently reported results about the UOR electrocatalysts in Table S5 (Supporting Information), which involved the detailed information about the types of electrocatalysts, electrolyte, and UOR performance at the same current density (100 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>). Moreover, as shown in Figure 3g, WN/Ni<sub>3</sub>C has much lower Tafel slope (20 mV  $dec^{-1}$ ) than Ni<sub>3</sub>C (24 mV  $dec^{-1}$ ), WN (56 mV  $dec^{-1}$ ), and NiWO<sub>v</sub> (39 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>), revealing the fast kinetics of UOR. WN/Ni<sub>3</sub>C also exhibits a much lower electron-transfer resistance (R<sub>ct</sub>) than Ni<sub>3</sub>C, WN, and NiWO<sub>x</sub> (Figure 3h). The electrontransfer resistance of WN/Ni<sub>3</sub>C ( $R_{ct}$ ) is 1.23  $\Omega$ , which is smaller than that of Ni<sub>3</sub>C (1.52  $\Omega$ ), NiWO<sub>x</sub> (2.25  $\Omega$ ), and WN (5.80  $\Omega$ ) during the evaluation of the UOR performance. The equivalent circuit and fitted results are shown in Figure S12 (Supporting Information). To evaluate the practical application of WN/Ni<sub>3</sub>C, the long-term stability test has been carried by chronopotentiometry. The result of the chrono-potential curve reveals that the overpotential slightly increased within 3 h and stabilized after 3 h (Figure 3i). After long-term stability test for 20 h, the potential of WN/Ni<sub>3</sub>C increases from 1.330 V to 1.346 V versus RHE, and the percentage of potential increase is only 1.2%. Although the overpotential has slightly increased during the 20 h test, it is still lower than other reported state-of-the-art electrocatalysts at the current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> (Figure 3f,i). This phenomenon can be explained by the characterization of SEM and XPS. As shown in Figure S13 (Supporting Information), the bulges on the surface of WN/Ni<sub>3</sub>C become larger, which originates from surface reconstruction to a certain degree. This process could cause the overpotential of UOR to slightly increase within 3 h. During the UOR process for 3 h, the interaction between WN and Ni<sub>3</sub>C interface gradually becomes stable, and the bulges no longer grow. The overpotential also keeps stable. Furthermore, as shown in Figure 5i, W element could dissolve during the construction of a fitted interface, which also causes the slightly increased overpotential. The used WN/Ni<sub>3</sub>C ceramic coating after long-term UOR testing was further studied by SEM. The morphology and microstructure of WN/Ni<sub>3</sub>C after long-term test of UOR slightly

A water-electrolysis device was established by coupling Pt/C and WN/Ni $_3$ C as cathode and anode to evaluate the performance of H $_2$  production and urea electrooxidation, respectively. The urea electrolyzer only needs the driving voltage of 1.38, 1.44, 1.53, 1.61, and 1.70 V to achieve the density of 10, 25, 50, 75, and 100 mA cm $^{-2}$ , which is 0.12, 0.21, 0.25, 0.28, and 0.29 V lower than that of overall water splitting to achieve the same current

Adv. Energy Mater. 2023, 13, 2302452

density, respectively (Figure 3j,k). By comparing the electricity expense for the water electrolysis in 1 m KOH with or without 0.33 m urea to generate one cubic meter of hydrogen gas, the electricity expense of urea electrolyzer was calculated to be 3.30, 3.43, 3.65, 3.85, and 4.05 kWh for generating 1 m³  $\rm H_2$  at the current density of 10, 25, 50, 75, and 100 mA cm $^{-2}$ , respectively, which are much lower than that of overall water splitting (3.55, 3.90, 4.17, 4.40, and 4.59 kWh) (Figure 3l).

#### 2.3. Electronic Structure Analyses of WN/Ni3C Ceramics Coating

To understand the high UOR activity for WN/Ni<sub>2</sub>C ceramics coating, the interface electronic interaction and coordination environment in WN/Ni<sub>3</sub>C ceramic coating were conducted using Xray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray adsorption spectroscopy (XAS). As shown in Figure 4a, high-resolution Ni 2p spectra of both WN/Ni<sub>3</sub>C and Ni<sub>3</sub>C can be deconvoluted into two remarkable peaks corresponding to Ni  $2p_{1/2}$  and Ni  $2p_{3/2}$ , showing the existence of two different valance states of Ni (i.e., Ni<sup>0</sup> and Ni<sup>2+</sup>). The higher content of Ni<sup>2+</sup> peak displays a dominant valance state of Ni(II) in WN/Ni<sub>3</sub>C and Ni<sub>3</sub>C.<sup>[16]</sup> Typically, the peaks located at 855.39 and 872.99 eV are assigned to Ni<sup>2+</sup> of Ni  $2p_{3/2}$  and Ni  $2p_{1/2}$  in WN/Ni<sub>3</sub>C.<sup>[16,17]</sup> And the binding energy shows positive shifts of 0.2 and 0.6 eV, compared with those of Ni<sub>3</sub>C, respectively. The high-resolution spectra of W 4f in WN/Ni<sub>3</sub>C and WN can be deconvoluted into two remarkable peaks of W  $4f_{5/2}$  and W  $4f_{7/2}$ , which are attributed to W-N and W-O bonds (Figure 4b). The binding energy of W-O bond in WN/Ni<sub>3</sub>C presents positive shift compared to that of WN, while the W-N bond shifts by 0.4 eV toward the direction of high binding energy (Figure 4b). [18] Interestingly, although the structure of WN is well indexed to the crystalline phase of WN (PDF card 75-1012), many W sites still coordinate with O to form W-O bonds. And both the percentages of W-O and W-N peaks in WN/Ni<sub>3</sub>C are higher than those of WN, indicating that the coupling of two components of WN and Ni<sub>3</sub>C increases the surface activity.

The high-resolution N 1s spectra of both WN and WN/Ni<sub>3</sub>C are deconvoluted into four main bonds corresponding to graphitic N, pyrrolic N, pyridinic N and M-N (M = Ni or W), respectively (Figure S14a, Supporting Information).[18] The contents of pyrrolic N and pyridinic N in WN/Ni<sub>3</sub>C are more than those of WN, indicating the interface enriches the coordination environment due to the increased types of atoms. Furthermore, the content of oxygen vacancy in WN/Ni<sub>3</sub>C is much higher than that of WN, which could also originate from the interface of WN and Ni<sub>3</sub>C (Figure S14b, Supporting Information). For the C 1s spectra of WN/Ni<sub>3</sub>C and Ni<sub>3</sub>C (Figure 4c), the remarkable peaks at 287.99, 285.99, and 284.79 eV are assigned to C-O, C-N, and C-C bonds, respectively, and the binding energy of C-O bond in WN/Ni<sub>2</sub>C positively shift by 0.4 eV relative to that of Ni<sub>3</sub>C. The high-resolution O 1s spectra of WN/Ni<sub>3</sub>C and Ni<sub>3</sub>C are shown in Figure S15 (Supporting Information). The peak at ≈530.60 eV corresponds to lattice oxygen (i.e., Ni–O or W–O bond) in WN/Ni<sub>3</sub>C and Ni-O bond of Ni<sub>3</sub>C. Another peak corresponding to the higher binding energy at 531.6–531.8 eV originates from the surface adsorbed oxygen (i.e., oxygen-deficient (O and O2)), and the peak at the highest binding energy of

O 1s is ascribed to water species.[19] The ratio of absorbed oxygen/lattice oxygen has been reported to reflect the amount of oxygen vacancy (Vo).[19] The higher content of oxygen vacancy for WN/Ni3C than that of Ni3C suggests that the introduction of WN modifies the interface structure of electrocatalyst. The results clearly reveal the evident electron interaction and valence modulation at the structural interface between two components, which facilitate the fast UOR kinetics.

To obtain more insights into the coordination information and explore the muti-interface effect on the electrocatalysts, the Ni Kedge of WN/Ni3C, Ni3C, NiO and Ni foil were tested by X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra. As shown in Figure 4d, the absorption edge of WN/Ni3C shows the similar characteristics to that of NiO, but the pre-edge of WN/Ni3C negatively shifts toward lower binding energy than that of NiO. The white line of Ni3C is very similar to that of Ni foil, but the absorption edge of Ni3C positively shifts a little toward higher energy, which demonstrates higher valance state of Ni in Ni3C than zero-valence Ni in Ni foil. The pre-edge energy of WN/Ni3C is between NiO and Ni3C (Figure 4d), indicating that the valence state of Ni is between 0 and +2, which is consistent with XPS results. As shown by the normalized W L3-edge XANES spectra of WN/Ni3C, the oxidation state of W locates between 0 (W powder) and +6 (WO3), even higher than that of WN (Figure 4g). The peaks of WN/Ni3C at the radial distance of 2.1 and 2.6 Å correspond to N─C and Ni─Ni bond, respectively, as shown in the X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra (Figure 4e). And the fitting results of XANES spectra of Ni K-edge in R space for WN/Ni3C and Ni3C were recorded in Tables S1 and S2 (Supporting Information). The fitted results reveal that the Ni─C bond

length in WN/Ni<sub>3</sub>C is significantly extended after introducing another phase (WN), which would cause electron redistribution at the interface. The radial distance of W=O and W-N is  $\approx$ 1.8 and 2.0 Å, respectively, nearly the same as those of WN (Figure 4h), which suggests that the interaction between Ni<sub>3</sub>C and WN has more important influence on the Ni sites than W sites. The fitting results of XANES spectra of W L3-edge in R space for WN/Ni3C and WN were recorded in Tables S3 and S4. To evaluate the detailed atomic bond information of Ni K-edge and W-L<sub>2</sub> edge, EX-AFS wavelet transform was carried out. The maximum intensity of WN/Ni<sub>3</sub>C and Ni<sub>3</sub>C located at ≈2.1 and 2.6 Å is ascribed to NiC and Ni-Ni bond, respectively. Compared with that of Ni<sub>3</sub>C, the maximum intensity of WN/Ni<sub>3</sub>C decreases to 2.1 Å, which possibly arises from the existence of Ni—W bond (Figure 4f). The maximum intensity of WN/Ni<sub>3</sub>C and WN located at 2.0 and 1.8 Å, is ascribed to W-N and W-O bond, respectively. Compared with WN, the shift of the maximum intensity located at 2.0 Å in WN/Ni<sub>3</sub>C is possibly caused by the formation of W-Ni bond (Figure 4i).

# 2.4. Origin of High UOR Activity Investigated Using In Situ and Ex Situ Experiments

To further reveal the catalytic process of WN/Ni<sub>3</sub>C toward UOR in situ Raman spectroscopy was carried out (Figure 5a-c). Specifically, WN/Ni<sub>3</sub>C has not been activated before OER test, because an obvious pair of peaks corresponding to Ni<sup>3+</sup> directly appeared after 40-cycle activation (Figure S16, Supporting Information). Note that the characteristic peak at 1000 cm<sup>-1</sup> under open-circuit potential (OCP), which is assigned to H<sub>2</sub>N-C-NH<sub>2</sub>, presents a redshift with the increase of the applied potential during the UOR process. The redshift phenomenon implies that the bond of H<sub>2</sub>N-C-NH<sub>2</sub> has been extended, which is helpful for adsorption and oxidation of urea molecular on the WN/Ni<sub>3</sub>C. Furthermore, in many Ni-based electrocatalysts, a pair of characteristic peaks at 475 and 560 cm<sup>-1</sup> usually appear, which are assigned to Ni<sup>3+</sup> species as the active site during the UOR process, but such Ni3+ species are not conducive to the desorption of the key intermediate CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup> toward UOR. In contrast, there are no Raman peaks emerged at 476 and 562 cm<sup>-1</sup> for WN/Ni<sub>3</sub>C, which suggest that no Ni<sup>3+</sup> species are produced during the UOR process. This would optimize the adsorption energy of COO\* intermediate, thus reducing the reaction barrier of UOR. In situ Raman test for WN/Ni<sub>3</sub>C during the OER process was also conducted. At the OCP potential, obvious peaks at 897 and 930 cm<sup>-1</sup> were assigned to  $[WO_4]$  unit and  $WO_4{}^{2-}$  stretch band. $^{[20]}$  With the increase of the applied potential to 1.4 V versus RHE, and a pair of characteristic peaks emerge at 476 and 562 cm<sup>-1</sup>, which could be well assigned to the Ni3+ site in WN/Ni3C (Figure 5c). Furthermore, the signal tested by in situ Raman is different from electrochemical CV curve. The region irradiated by in situ Raman laser completely belongs to the WN/Ni<sub>3</sub>C structure ceramic coating, rather than the NF area. Because Ni2+ in WN/Ni3C ceramic coating does not suffer an oxidation process to produce Ni<sup>3+</sup> species, in situ Raman spectroscopy cannot detect the Ni<sup>3+</sup> signal.

The adsorption behavior of urea molecules on these asprepared electrocatalysts could be effectively measured by

Helmholtz adsorption curve of reactants at the open circuit. First, the open circuit potentials of WN/Ni<sub>3</sub>C, Ni<sub>3</sub>C and WN were recorded in 1 м KOH with 0.33 м urea. After a while, highconcentration urea solution was injected into maintain the concentration of mixture solution and the open circuit potentials were recorded again (Figure 5d). WN/Ni<sub>3</sub>C shows a larger OCP difference (0.226 V) than Ni<sub>3</sub>C (0.224 V) after injecting urea solution, which proves that WN/Ni<sub>3</sub>C has the stronger adsorption for urea molecules (Figure 5d).[21] The adsorption strength of the reactant toward UOR and OER on the WN/Ni<sub>3</sub>C, Ni<sub>3</sub>C and WN was measured by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), respectively (Figure 5e,f; Figures S17, and S18, Supporting Information). The potential at 1.27 and 1.37 V was chosen as the non-Faraday region and Faraday region during the UOR process, respectively. The result shows the phase angles of these three catalysts in the low frequency region decrease rapidly during the UOR process.[22] During the OER process, the potential at 1.37 and 1.57 V versus RHE was chosen as non-Faraday region and Faraday region, respectively. WN/Ni<sub>3</sub>C indicates the smallest phase angles than other electrocatalysts during the UOR and OER (Figure 5e,f), which demonstrates strong adsorption for the reactant OH<sup>-</sup> and urea molecule.<sup>[22]</sup> These results suggest that WN/Ni<sub>3</sub>C composite structure has the optimized interface structure, which could achieve the fast kinetics of UOR and OER (Figure 5f).

To further analyze the fast kinetics of WN/Ni<sub>3</sub>C during UOR, we studied the dependence of electrocatalytic performance on electrochemical impedance for electrocatalysts. Comparing with the Nyquist plots of these as-prepared electrocatalysts during OER and UOR, it is found that the Nyquist plot of WN/Ni<sub>3</sub>C shows the smallest semicircle during the UOR process, indicating that WN/Ni<sub>3</sub>C has faster electronic conductivity and chargetransfer rate (Figure S17, Supporting Information). Furthermore, the semicircle of WN/Ni<sub>3</sub>C shows a rapid decrease trend among these electrocatalysts, suggesting that WN/Ni<sub>3</sub>C was easily polarized during the UOR process to facilitate electron transfer and absorption of hydroxyl groups and other intermediates (Figure S17, Supporting Information).[23] And the adsorption behavior of these as-prepared electrocatalysts can be studied on the Bode diagram (Figure S18, Supporting Information; Figure 5e,f). Interestingly, compared with WN/Ni<sub>3</sub>C, the frequency values of WN move faster with the potential increase, which suggests that WN could has a stronger UOR reactant adsorption behavior.<sup>[23]</sup> This result gives another evidence to prove W site as the active site in WN/Ni<sub>3</sub>C during the UOR process (Figure S18, Supporting Information).

The temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) measurements were performed to evaluate adsorption behavior of function groups on WN/Ni<sub>3</sub>C, Ni<sub>3</sub>C, and WN. Urea molecule contains two typical functional groups, that is, one carbonyl group (C=O bond) and two amino groups (-NH<sub>2</sub>). The TPD experiments were carried out in CO and NH<sub>3</sub> atmosphere, respectively, to reveal the preferred adsorption sites (Ni or W) on WN/Ni<sub>3</sub>C. As shown in Figure S19 (Supporting Information), WN/Ni<sub>3</sub>C shows much higher adsorption temperature (291 °C) than those of Ni<sub>3</sub>C (277 °C) and WN, while indicates a lower desorption temperature (263 °C) than those of Ni<sub>3</sub>C (270 °C) and WN (323 °C). This suggests that the enhanced urea adsorption could be ascribed to the function group of C=O bond rather than -NH<sub>2</sub>. Based on the

above results, it is speculated that the C═O function group of urea could directly adsorb on the interface of WN/Ni3C, and the adsorption energy of urea molecule could be optimized by the modulated interface structure.

Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was also performed to detect the adsorption behavior on the as-prepared electrocatalysts by comparing the spectra before and after immersing these electrocatalysts into 1 m KOH with 0.33 m urea for 1 h (Figure 5g). Noted that four peaks of urea molecules at 1683, 1625, 1465, and 1153 cm<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> correspond to the functional groups of C═O, N─H, C─N, and H─N─H, respectively.[13] After the adsorption of urea molecules, the peaks of N─H and C─N in WN/Ni3C were broadened compared with those before the adsorption, indicating the urea molecules were successfully adsorbed on the WN/Ni3C. However, FTIR reveals that there are no characteristic peak corresponding to the function groups of urea molecules adsorbed on the Ni3C and WN, indicating the weaker adsorption capacity than that on WN/Ni3C. The above FTIR results also suggest that the WN/Ni3C composite could optimize the urea adsorption and bring out the high UOR activity for WN/Ni3C (Figure 5g).

The valence changes of Ni and W sites could help to clarify the mechanism of WN/Ni3C electrocatalysts after the UOR and OER process by high-resolution XPS spectra. The spectrum of Ni 2p is deconvoluted into Ni<sup>0</sup> and Ni<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> before the electrocatalytic reaction. After the OER, an obvious peak ascribed to Ni<sup>3</sup><sup>+</sup> appears clearly, while after the UOR, the peak assigned to Ni<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> in Ni 2p3/2 only shifts toward the higher binding energy (Figure 5h). This also indicates that most of Ni sites are oxidized to Ni<sup>3</sup><sup>+</sup> during the OER, while most of Ni sites keep the valence of Ni<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> during the UOR. The spectrum of W 4f is deconvoluted into the bond of W─O and W─N, and the strength of these two bonds significantly decrease, which may originate from the dissolution of W element after the OER. However, the binding energy of W─O bond downshifts by 0.6 eV after UOR, giving strong evidence of electron transfer between WN and Ni3C (Figure 5i). It is noted that the binding energy of Ni and W moves in opposite direction after UOR. The peak assigned to Ni<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> downshifts by 0.5 eV toward lower binding energy, and the peak of Ni0 disappeared. The energy level of W─O upshifts by 0.2 eV after UOR, revealing the electron transfer from W site to Ni site (Figure 5h,i). This is favorable for remaining the valance of Ni2<sup>+</sup>. Furthermore, the high-resolution XPS of C 1s for WN/Ni3C after UOR and OER stability test were shown in Figure S20 (Supporting Information). The C 1s spectrum is deconvoluted into three remarkable peaks corresponding to C─O, C─N, and C─C, respectively. The binding energy of C─O bond downshifts by 0.5 and 0.6 eV after UOR and OER, respectively, indicating C element as the electron acceptor is helpful to maintain the valance of Ni sites (Figure S20, Supporting Information). Notably, the intensity of W 4f peaks after OER/UOR test is evidently decreased, because W element may dissolve into the electrolyte to form WO4 <sup>2</sup><sup>−</sup> during the UOR and OER, respectively. Many studies have been reported the highvalance traditional metal (W, Mo, and Cr) could dissolve during the electrocatalysis process.[14] The in situ Raman and XPS spectra also prove this result. In the Raman spectrum, the signal of the [WO4] unit and WO4 <sup>2</sup><sup>−</sup> stretch band becomes weak when applied the potential to drive the UOR and OER. This could be ascribed to two reasons: one is the bubbles on the electrode surface to block Raman signals, and the other is the WO4 <sup>2</sup><sup>−</sup> dissolution. The XPS statistical results also confirm the W element dissolution. The atomic ratio of Ni to W changes from 1:1 to 9:1 for UOR and to 13:1 for OER, respectively.

#### **2.5. DFT Calculation**

To further reveal the underlying mechanism of interaction between WN and Ni3C on improving the UOR activity, density function theory (DFT) calculations were carried out. As shown in **Figure 6**a and Figure S21 (Supporting Information), considering the multiple sites at the interface of WN/Ni3C, the adsorption energy of urea at different sites was screened, including the W site, Ni1 site (close to W site) and Ni2 site (far from W site), while the adsorption site on Ni3C and WN is only Ni and W site, respectively. The adsorption energy of W, Ni1 and Ni2 at WN/Ni3C is −1.48, 1.46, and 0.82 eV, respectively, which indicates the urea molecules prefer to be adsorbed on the W site.

The adsorption energy of Ni site on Ni3C (−0.56 eV) and W site on WN (−0.54 eV) is larger than those of WN/Ni3C, indicating that urea molecule has stronger adsorption at WN/Ni3C, which is consistent with the experiment results. The above results show the interface between WN and Ni3C could help to modify the adsorption behavior of urea molecules at WN/Ni3C, which optimize the electrolysis for urea molecule.

In addition, Gibbs free energy profiles along the UOR reaction pathway on WN/Ni3C, Ni3C, and WN electrocatalyst were calculated, respectively (Figure 6b). Among three electrocatalysts, urea molecule first adsorbs on the corresponding active sites and then four H atoms are removed in proper order to form \*CONN. The free energy of \*CONN intermediate transforming to \*CO─N2 through C─N bond breakage and N─N coupling is negative (Figure 6b,c), implying this is spontaneous. Compared to Ni3C/WN ceramics coatings, the adsorption energy of \*CO─N2 intermediate on single-phase Ni3C and WN show stronger adsorption, thus inhibiting the follow-up steps on the surface of catalysts. The process of \*CO─N2 intermediate to \*CO·OH shows the largest barrier during the whole UOR, regarded as the rate determining step (RDS). On WN/Ni3C, this RDS occurring on the W sites has lower energy barrier than those of as-prepared electrocatalyst with the single phase, indicating the abundant interfaces between Ni3C and WN could optimize the adsorption and desorption of the key intermediates during the UOR process (Figure 6b,c).

Furthermore, the density of states (DOS) of electrocatalyst was calculated before and after the adsorption of urea molecule on WN/Ni3C, Ni3C, and WN, respectively, to reveal the electron transfer between urea and electrocatalyst (Figure 6d–f). Based on the calculated results, the electron transfer from the WN/Ni3C to urea molecule (0.094 e) is larger than those of Ni3C (0.075 e) and WN (0.045 e), proving strong interaction between the electrocatalyst and urea molecule (Figure 6d–f). The number of electron transfer between WN and Ni3C was also calculated by making a statistic for the atoms with the most significant charge changes before and after adsorption of intermediates. After adsorbing intermediates, the number of electron transfer of Ni site is 0.0576 eV, while the electron

transfer of C site is only 0.0006 eV, which is ascribed to the indirect bonds of C with another WN component (Figure S22a,b, Supporting Information). The number of electron transfer of N site is 0.0011 eV, while the electron transfer of W site is 0.0107 eV. The small amount of electron change at the N site suggests that N could promote electron transfer between interfaces via W-N and Ni─N bond, thus providing high UOR activity for W site and stabilizing the valence state of Ni (Figure S22c,d, Supporting Information).

# **3. Discussion**

In summary, an advanced ceramic coating of WN/Ni3C has been successfully prepared via high-temperature pyrolysis, which shows superior UOR activity to the state-of-art Ni-based electrocatalysts. The characterization results imply the strong interfacial interaction of WN/Ni3C, thus maintaining bivalent Ni sites by transporting electrons from WN to Ni3C during the UOR process. The resultant electron transfer modulated by two counterparts in ceramic coating optimizes the adsorption energy of key intermediate of \*CO─N2 and finally lowers the barrier of RDS (\*CO─N2 → \*CO·OH). Both the experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that the electronic interaction between two components in WN/Ni3C could enhance the adsorption energy of urea molecule and OH<sup>−</sup>. The results emphasize the importance of unique two-phase nanocomposites, which could optimize the interface structure, and reserve the valence of Ni site, thus improving the UOR activity. This work inspires the rational design and development of advanced ceramics coatings for high-performance electrocatalysis applications.

((NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>6</sub>W<sub>7</sub>O<sub>24</sub>·6H<sub>2</sub>O) was obtained from Alfa Aesar. Urea was purchased from Tokyo Chemical Industry Co. Ltd. Nickel foam (NF) was purchased from Xinyi Metal Materials Co., Ltd. Argon (Ar) used for urea pyrolysis was of high purity. All the chemical reagents were used directly without further purification.

Pretreatment of Nickel Foam (NF): Nickel foam ( $\approx 2 \times 4 \text{ cm}^2$ ) was carefully pretreated with 1 m HCl to remove the NiO $_{\times}$  layer in the ultrasound bath. It was then immersed into deionized water and ethanol with 1:1 volume ratio for 20 min to remove HCl. Finally, the treated NF was dried in an oven at 60 °C for 1 h, followed by storage in ethanol at room temperature before utilization.

Preparation of NiWO $_{\rm x}$  on NF (NiWO $_{\rm x}$ /NF) and Ceramics Coating WN/Ni $_3$ C on NF (WN/Ni $_3$ C/NF): Typically, NiWO $_{\rm x}$  was synthesized on NF by using a hydrothermal process as follows. Ni(NO $_3$ ) $_2$ ·6H $_2$ O (1.60 mmol) and (NH $_4$ ) $_6$ W $_7$ O $_2$ 4·6H $_2$ O (0.12 mmol) were dissolved in a beaker under magnetically stirring for 30 min. After the addition of the clean NF (2 × 4 cm $^2$ ), it was transferred into a 50 mL Teflon-line stainless-steel autoclave and heated at 160 °C for 6 h to obtain the NiWO $_{\rm x}$ /NF. The as-synthesized NiWO $_{\rm x}$ /NF was washed by using an appropriate amount of deionized water and ethanol for three times. Then, it was dried overnight in an oven at 60 °C. For the preparation of WN/Ni $_3$ C/NF, NiWO $_{\rm x}$ /NF was mixed with 50 mmol of urea, followed by pyrolysis at 460 °C for 2 h to form WN/Ni $_3$ C ceramic coating on NF.

Preparation of WN: Na $_2$ WO $_4$  (10 mmol) was dissolved into 100 mL deionized water under continuously stirring, followed by injection of 2 m HCl to form a yellow precipitate. After adding 3.5 mmol oxalic acid into the above mixture solution and subsequently heating at 90 °C for 3 h, the as-prepared WO $_x$  powder was washed using the appropriate amount of deionized water and ethanol for three times. Then, WO $_x$  (1 g) was placed into a tubular furnace, and heated at 700 °C for 3 h at a rate of 5 °C min $^{-1}$  under ammonia atmosphere to obtain the WN powder.

Preparation of  $Ni_3C$  Coating on NF:  $Ni_3C$  was synthesized on NF by using a simple two-step method as follows. First,  $Ni(NO_3)_2 \cdot 6H_2O$  (1.60 mmol),  $NH_4F$  (4 mmol), and urea (10 mmol) were dissolved in a breaker under magnetically stirring for 30 min. The clean NF (2×4 cm²) was added into a 50 mL Teflon-line stainless-steel autoclave and heated at 160 °C for 6 h to obtain the  $Ni(OH)_2/NF$ . Next,  $Ni_3C/NF$  was prepared by mixing  $Ni(OH)_2/NF$  with 50 mmol of urea, followed by pyrolysis at 460 °C for 2 h to obtain  $Ni_3C$  on NF.

Materials Characterization: STEM images were collected by using JEOL TripleC#3, an ARM200F-based ultra-high vacuum microscope equipped with a JEOL delta corrector and a cold field emission gun operating at 60 kV. The ADF probe current was 15 pA, and the convergence halfangle and internal acquisition half-angle were 37 and 76 mrad, respectively. The EELS core loss spectrum and mapping were acquired by 2D array with an exposure time of 0.2 s per pixel and recorded with a Gatan Rio CMOS camera optimized for low voltage operation. The microstructures of the as-prepared electrocatalysts were analyzed by the field emission scanning electron microscope (SEM) on a FEI Magellan 400L XHR. The elemental composition and valence states were carried out by the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements on a Thermo ESCALAB250Xi electron spectrometer. The Al  $K_{\alpha}$  source (1486.6 eV) was used as the radiation source. First, WN/Ni<sub>3</sub>C and other compared samples were cut into  $1 \times$ 1 cm<sup>2</sup> square pieces. Second, a vacuum treatment was conducted to remove surface adsorbed impurities as much as possible. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the as-prepared samples were collected on a D8 AD-VANCE X-ray diffractometer. Temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) test was carried on a BelCate II, Japan. The X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectra of all samples were carried out on Taiwan Photon Source, Beamline 44A. The Ni K-edge XAFS was measured in transmission mode and the W L3-edge XAFS was measured in fluorescence mode. All data were analyzed by using the Demeter XAFS data analysis system. [24] For the Ni K-edge, the R-space EXAFS signal was obtained by k<sub>3</sub>-weighted Fourier transform of the EXAFS signal  $\chi$  (k) over a k-range from 3.0 Å $^{-1}$  to 14.0 Å $^{-1}$ . Two Ni paths, Ni-C and Ni-Ni was constructed to fit the R-space spectrum of Ni<sub>3</sub>C at a range from 1 to 3.1 Å. For WN/Ni<sub>3</sub>C, a third Ni-W path was included within the same R range. At the W L<sub>3</sub>-edge, the k-range used was from 3.0 to 12.5  $Å^{-1}$ . The fitting was performed over the R-space at a range of 1 Å - 2.7 Å. Three paths were used for WN/Ni $_3$ C, which are W-O, W-N, and W-Ni, respectively.

In Situ Raman Experiments: In situ Raman experiments were tested on a Renishaw inVia Reflex Raman spectrometer with excitation wavelengths of 532 nm under controlled potentials by CHI 760 workstation. WN/Ni<sub>3</sub>C synthesized on NF was directly used as a working electrode, while a Pt wire and Hg/HgO were used as a counter electrode and reference electrode. The in situ Raman curves were studied at the different potentials by chronoamperometry in 1 m KOH with 0.33 m urea electrolyte, respectively.

Electrochemical Measurements: The electrochemical tests of all the electrocatalysts were performed through a standard three electrode system on the CHI 760E at 25 °C. The OER test was carried out in a O2saturated 1 m KOH electrolyte, while the UOR test was measured in 1 м КОН with 0.33 м urea electrolyte (the selection of concentration was based on human urine containing 2%-2.5% urea). The as-prepared WN/Ni<sub>3</sub>C ceramic coating, carbon rod and Hg/HgO were used as the working electrode, counter electrode, and reference electrode, respectively. All the potentials were converted to standard hydrogen electrode (RHE) based on the formula:  $E_{RHE} = E_{Hg/HgO} + 0.098 + 0.059 *pH$ . CV curves were obtained in 1 m KOH (toward OER) and 1 m KOH with 0.33 m urea (toward UOR), respectively. All the linear scan voltammetry (LSV) curves with 90% iR compensation were collected in the corresponding electrolyte. The potential range was from 1.028 to 1.728 V versus RHE depended on different electrolytes at the scan rate of 5 mV  $s^{-1}$ . EIS spectra were obtained at a particular potential, corresponding to the current density during the LSV test without iR correction at 10 mA  $cm^{-2}$  (0.412 V vs SCE). And the potential range of the in situ EIS spectra tests was set from 1.120 to 1.720 V versus RHE for OER, while the potential range was from 1.120 to 1.470 V versus RHE for UOR. The electricity expense of hydrogen production in the two-electrode water splitting system was calculated by the

$$W_{H2} = \frac{IUT}{Q_{H2} \times 10^3} \tag{1}$$

where  $W_{H2}$  (kWh m<sup>-3</sup>) represents the direct electricity consumption, I (A) and U (V) are direct current and voltage of two-electrode system, respectively, Q represents the hydrogen production during the detection period, and T is detection time.

And the actual electricity expense for electrolyzing water was calculated by the equation:

$$W = QU = 2 \times 6.023 \times 10^{23} \times 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \times EOP$$
 (2)

where EOP represents actual operating voltage for electrolyzing water in a two-electrode electrolyzer.

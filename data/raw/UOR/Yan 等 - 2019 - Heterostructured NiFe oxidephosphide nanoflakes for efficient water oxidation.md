To realise the gradual replacement of noble metal-based materials for electrocatalytic energy conversion, numerous studies need to be focused on the compounds based on inexpensive 3d transition metals (such as Fe and Co). For achieving energetic electrocatalysis, elaborately designed nanostructures are urgently desired. Here, we reported a facile approach for the preparation of a NiFe oxide/phosphide ( $Ni_{2/3}Fe_{1/3}O/Ni_{4/3}Fe_{2/3}P$ ) heterostructure with a 2-dimensional (2D) nanoflake-like morphology. Based on the combined advantages of composition and structure, the 2D  $Ni_{2/3}Fe_{1/3}O/Ni_{4/3}Fe_{2/3}P$  nanoflakes were characterized to exhibit a high activity for the electrocatalytic water oxidation, surpassing that of individual  $Ni_{2/3}Fe_{1/3}O$  or  $Ni_{4/3}Fe_{2/3}P$  nanoplates. This result may offer a great possibility of delicatedly designing nanostructures for highly efficient electrochemical energy conversion.

## Introduction

With the rapidly increasing global energy demand and deterioration of the environment, there is a pressing demand to develop clean and sustainable energy. 1-3 Due to clean combustion and renewability, efficient hydrogen generation from the electrolysis of water is considered a potential candidate as a renewable energy resource. Regarding the large-scale preparation of hydrogen the sluggish kinetics of oxygen evolution reaction, involving multiple proton-coupled electron transfer in the overall water splitting process, have been regarded as the technical hurdle. It is challenging to develop high-activity catalysts for electrocatalytic water oxidation.<sup>4,5</sup> Currently, typical electrocatalysts used in the water splitting reactions are mainly based on platinum group metals and/or their oxides, such as IrO2 and RuO2.6-8 However, the high cost and scarcity of these noble metal elements make it difficult for the industrial-grade applications. Therefore, exploiting costeffective and high-activity catalysts for efficient OER is becoming a crucial target.

Due to their redox-active characteristics, 3d transition metal-based compounds, such as Ni-, Co- and Fe-containing materials, have been reported as OER electrocatalysts. 9-18 Among these 3d transition metal-based species, oxides are considered as a kind of promising electrocatalysts on the account of their structural and electrochemical stabilities during the continuous electrocatalysis processes. 19 However, transition metal oxides usually suffer from relatively low activity; thus, there exists a great potential to improve their electrocatalytic performance. Therefore, considerable efforts have been made for the enhancement of the activity. It has been confirmed that for unary metal oxides, the selective introduction of another metal content (i.e., designing bimetallic oxide) can effectively improve the electrocatalytic activity since some introduced guest ions can promote the stable existence of the high-oxidation-state metal ions, such as Ni<sup>4+</sup>, or optimize the electronic structures of the catalysts and thus the adsorption/desorption of the reaction intermediates.20 Moreover, another composition tuning strategy, i.e., constructing heterostructures, has also been demonstrated as an efficacious approach to enhance the electrocatalytic performance. For heterostructures, in addition to inheriting the inherent physicochemical advantages of parent materials, some other novel characteristics ascribed to the synergetic effects can also be observed at the heterointerfaces, giving rise to higher activity in electrocatalysis. Hwang et al. verified that because of the synergetic effects originating from the interaction of fundamental MoS2 and NiFe layered double hydroxide (LDH) phases, the MoS<sub>2</sub>/NiFe LDH heterostructure showed an ultrahigh activity in the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution process, markedly overpassing that of the individual MoS<sub>2</sub> or the NiFe

LDH material.<sup>21</sup> In addition, compared with bulk counterparts, elaborately designed nanostructures, which have more catalytic sites and show better electron and/or mass transfer, can substantially bring about high performance in electrocatalytic reactions.<sup>22</sup> In contrast with 0-dimensional (0D), 1-dimensional (1D) and 3-dimensional (3D) structures, 2D nanoarchitectures have been demonstrated to promote the exposure of active interfaces, thus providing more electrocatalytic sites. Moreover, the internal structural strain of 2D morphology can contribute to the enhanced electrocatalytic performance.<sup>23</sup>

Enlightened by the above-mentioned strategies, in this study, a bimetallic Ni<sub>2/3</sub>Fe<sub>1/3</sub>O/Ni<sub>4/3</sub>Fe<sub>2/3</sub>P heterostructure with a 2D nanoflake-like morphology was prepared *via* a step-by-step evolution of the nickel-iron LDH precursor. When Ni<sub>2/3</sub>Fe<sub>1/3</sub>O/Ni<sub>4/3</sub>Fe<sub>2/3</sub>P nanoflakes were characterized as catalysts for electrocatalytic water oxidation, the anodic current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> at a low overpotential of 273 mV accompanied by a small Tafel slope of 79 mV dec<sup>-1</sup> was achieved, which was superior to those of the pure NiFe oxide or phosphide nanostructures, thus providing a strong evidence for the synergetic effects of heterostructures.

## **Experimental section**

All the chemicals in this study were of analytical grade and were directly used without further purification. Both hydrated nickel chloride (NiCl $_2$ ·6H $_2$ O) and anthraquinone-2-sulfonic acid sodium salt monohydrate (AQS) were purchased from the Aladdin Industrial Corporation (Shanghai, China). Hydrated ferrous chloride (FeCl $_2$ ·4H $_2$ O) was purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Industrial Ltd (Japan). Hexamethylenetetramine (HMT) was purchased from Alfa Aesar (Tianjin, China). NaH $_2$ PO $_2$ ·H $_2$ O was purchased from Sinopharm Group Co. Ltd (Shanghai, China).

### Synthesis of Ni<sub>2/3</sub>Fe<sub>1/3</sub> LDH

Ni $_{2/3}$ Fe $_{1/3}$  LDH platelets were synthesized according to a previously reported topochemical oxidation method. Typically, NiCl $_2$ ·6H $_2$ O (1.25 mmol), FeCl $_2$ ·4H $_2$ O (0.625 mmol), AQS (1.25 mmol) and HMT (15 mmol) were dissolved in 250 mL of deionized water with continuous agitation. The solution was then refluxed at 120 °C for 6 h under N $_2$  protection. After cooling naturally, the precipitate was washed using deionized water and ethanol for several times. Then, the precipitate was dried at 60 °C and Ni $_{2/3}$ Fe $_{1/3}$  LDH nanoflakes were obtained.

#### Synthesis of 2D Ni<sub>2/3</sub>Fe<sub>1/3</sub>O nanoflakes

 $Ni_{2/3}Fe_{1/3}$  LDH nanoflakes were placed into a crucible and heated at 500 °C in air for 4 h. After cooling naturally,  $Ni_{2/3}Fe_{1/3}O$  nanoflakes were obtained.

#### Synthesis of 2D Ni<sub>2/3</sub>Fe<sub>1/3</sub>O/Ni<sub>4/3</sub>Fe<sub>2/3</sub>P heterostructure

To obtain a 2D Ni $_{2/3}$ Fe $_{1/3}$ O/Ni $_{4/3}$ Fe $_{2/3}$ P composite, NaH $_2$ PO $_2$ ·H $_2$ O and Ni $_{2/3}$ Fe $_{1/3}$ O with a designed mass ratio (2, 5 or 10) were put into two separate quartz boats with NaH $_2$ PO $_2$ ·H $_2$ O at the

upstream side. Subsequently, the boats were kept at 400 °C for 120 min in a steady Ar flow with a heating rate of 1 °C min<sup>-1</sup>. The obtained composites were noted as  $Ni_{2/3}Fe_{1/3}O/Ni_{4/3}Fe_{2/3}P$ ,  $Ni_{4/3}Fe_{2/3}P$ -1 and  $Ni_{4/3}Fe_{2/3}P$ -2, according to the mass ratio of  $NaH_2PO_2$  to  $Ni_{2/3}Fe_{1/3}O$  precursor of 2, 5, and 10, respectively.

#### Structural characterization

The phase compositions of the as-prepared samples were confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku D/max 2500) utilizing the Cu K $\alpha$  radiation. The morphological and microstructural details were studied using a scanning electron microscope (SEM, FEI Helios Nanolab 600i) and a transmission electron microscope (TEM, FEI Tecnai G2 F20). The chemical compositions of the samples were analyzed using energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) coupled with a TEM instrument and inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ESCALAB250Xi) was used to establish the valence states.

#### **Electrochemical measurements**

5 mg portion of the catalyst powder was dispersed in a mixed water-propanol solution (1 mL, v/v = 1), and then Nafion solution (5 µL, 10 wt%) was added. The suspension was treated with an ultrasonic bath for 30 min to obtain a homogeneous ink. The working electrode was prepared by dripping the catalyst ink onto a glassy carbon electrode (diameter = 3 mm) to reach a catalyst loading of 0.17 mg cm<sup>-2</sup>, and subsequently it was dried at 120 °C for 12 h. All electrochemical measurements were performed on a CHI 760E electrochemical workstation in a standard three-electrode system using Hg/HgO as the reference electrode and coiled Pt wire as the counter electrode. All potentials in this study were calibrated with respect to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). 20 cycles of cyclic voltammetry (CV) scan were used to activate the catalysts. The polarization curves were tested at a scan rate of 3 mV s<sup>-1</sup> by 95% iR correction with a rotation rate of 1600 rpm to remove the generated oxygen gas. Electrochemical impedance spectra were investigated at 1.53 V vs. RHE in the frequency range of 0.1-10 000 Hz with an AC voltage amplitude of 5 mV.

## Results and discussion

A NiFe oxide/phosphide composite was prepared by the partial phosphorization of the corresponding oxide, which was obtained by calcining the AQS ions-intercalated hydroxide nanoflakes, as illustrated by the scheme in Fig. 1. The AQS ions-intercalated hydroxide precursor was attained *via* an oilbath process using FeCl<sub>2</sub>·4H<sub>2</sub>O, NiCl<sub>2</sub>·6H<sub>2</sub>O, AQS and HMT as starting materials. In the oil-bath procedure, AQS played a crucial role as an *in situ* oxidizer to transform ferrous anions (Fe<sup>2+</sup>) into ferric anions (Fe<sup>3+</sup>) as well as a simultaneous anion-type intercalator into the interlayers to balance the positive charge of the NiFe hydroxide host layers.<sup>24</sup> Fig. S1a† displays the XRD pattern of the oil-bath product. A series of reflections strongly indicate the typical α-type hydroxide phase with an

interlayer spacing of ~2.0 nm, which is similar to our previous study, revealing the successful preparation of AQS ions-intercalated NiFe hydroxide. Fig. 2a displays the XRD patterns of products after the calcination and/or phosphorization. The black pattern could match well with the cubic NiO phase (JCPDS no. 89-7130). The calcined product was therefore speculated to be Ni<sub>2/3</sub>Fe<sub>1/3</sub>O. After a partial phosphorization treatment, *i.e.*, when the molar ratio of NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>2</sub>·H<sub>2</sub>O to oxide precursor was 2, as can be seen from the red trace, the product turned out to be the Ni<sub>2/3</sub>Fe<sub>1/3</sub>O/Ni<sub>4/3</sub>Fe<sub>2/3</sub>P composite. In addition, the comparison of the XPS patterns of monometallic Ni<sub>2</sub>P/NiO and the Ni<sub>4/3</sub>Fe<sub>2/3</sub>P products, as shown in Fig. S2,† further confirmed

the partial substitution of Ni by Fe atoms. With the further increase in the NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>2</sub>·H<sub>2</sub>O/Ni<sub>2/3</sub>Fe<sub>1/3</sub>O molar ratio to 5, as indicated by the blue pattern, no peaks of oxide was detected, suggesting that the composite was entirely transformed into the hexagonal Ni<sub>4/3</sub>Fe<sub>2/3</sub>P phase. The morphologies of the asprepared products were investigated using SEM. Fig. 2b shows a typical SEM image of NiFe LDHs, by which hierarchical flower-like microspheres assembled by 2D nanoflakes with a lateral size of  $\sim$ 500 nm could be seen. After a calcination process, as depicted in Fig. 2c, the hierarchical structure was well maintained. When the Ni<sub>2/3</sub>Fe<sub>1/3</sub>O was further treated by NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>2</sub>·H<sub>2</sub>O at 400 °C, no obvious changes could be seen for

the nanoflake-like morphology. However, for an entire phosphide product, the morphology, as shown in Fig. S3a,† was still of a hierarchical flower-like microsphere assembled by nanoflakes of similar size. On the account of the above observations, it could be concluded that after the calcination process and following phosphatization treatment, the 2D structure of the initial NiFe LDH nanoflakes remained.

To further probe the microstructure, the Ni<sub>2/3</sub>Fe<sub>1/3</sub>O/ Ni<sub>4/3</sub>Fe<sub>2/3</sub>P was studied using TEM. Fig. 3a shows a typical TEM image of the Ni<sub>2/3</sub>Fe<sub>1/3</sub>O/Ni<sub>4/3</sub>Fe<sub>2/3</sub>P composite, further confirming the morphology as nanoflakes. Three distinct diffraction rings were observed in the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern, as indicated in Fig. 3b, corresponding to the (200) and (310) reflections of the  $Ni_{2/3}Fe_{1/3}O$  phase and

The spacings for the marked lattice fringes are about 0.243 nm and 0.497 nm (Fig. 3c), corresponding to the (111) plane of hexagonal  $Ni_{4/3}Fe_{2/3}P$  and the (100) plane of cubic  $Ni_{2/3}Fe_{1/3}O$ . This observation provides a strong evidence for the co-existence of the  $Ni_{2/3}Fe_{1/3}O$  and  $Ni_{4/3}Fe_{2/3}P$  phases. The elemental mapping of an individual  $Ni_{2/3}Fe_{1/3}O/Ni_{4/3}Fe_{2/3}P$  nanoflake, as displayed in Fig. 3d, shows that the nanoflake was composed of Ni, Fe, P

and O elements. In addition, it is worth noting that all of Ni, Fe, P and O are homogenously dispersed over the  $Ni_{2/3}Fe_{1/3}O/Ni_{4/3}Fe_{2/3}P$  nanoflake, revealing the continuous distribution of  $Ni_{2/3}Fe_{1/3}O$  and  $Ni_{4/3}Fe_{2/3}P$  phase, *i.e.* a homogenous phosphatization reaction for the  $Ni_{2/3}Fe_{1/3}O$  precursor. The EDS result, as shown in Fig. S4,† further confirmed the co-existence of Ni, Fe, P and O elements. Moreover, the Ni/Fe molar ratio is detected as 2, which is equal to the feed ratio.

XPS was used to investigate the surface chemical information of the as-prepared  $Ni_{2/3}Fe_{1/3}O/Ni_{4/3}Fe_{2/3}P$  composite.

The high-resolution Ni 2p spectrum, as displayed in Fig. 4a, shows a typical fluctuant profile of the Ni-based compounds. Two peaks at 856.2 and 874.2 eV correspond to the two spinorbit doublets of Ni 2p<sub>3/2</sub> and Ni 2p<sub>1/2</sub>, while those at 881.3 and 862.7 eV are ascribed to two shake-up satellites (identified as "sat.").25 These characteristic peaks were assigned to the oxidation state of Ni in  $Ni_{2/3}Fe_{1/3}O$ . Moreover, the peaks at around 853.9 and 871.9 eV were attributed to the Ni-P connection in the Ni<sub>2/3</sub>Fe<sub>1/3</sub>O/Ni<sub>4/3</sub>Fe<sub>2/3</sub>P composite. The binding energy of Ni-P was about 1.7 eV positive to that of Ni metal (852.2 eV). This shift was mainly attributed to the partial electron transfer between Ni and P in the phosphide, indicating that the valence of Ni in the Ni-P bond was more positive than that of Ni metal and less than that of Ni(II) for the Ni-O bond. 26,27 In the Fe 2p spectrum (Fig. 4b), two peaks with binding energies of 711.6 and 724.7 eV accompanied by the satellite peaks at 715 and 729 eV, respectively, were attributed to the Fe(III)-O species.<sup>28</sup> The binding energies at 707.1 and 720.0 eV can be assigned to the Fe-P species generated on the catalyst surface. 29,30 The high-resolution P 2p spectrum, as can be seen in Fig. 4c, displays two peaks with binding energies of 129.7 and 130.4 eV, which can be referred to as P 2p<sub>3/2</sub> and P 2p<sub>1/2</sub>, respectively, indicating the binding between P and Ni or Fe. Furthermore, the O 1s spectra can be divided into two characteristic peaks at 530.2 and 531.5 eV, as indicated in Fig. 4d. These two peaks can be ascribed to both the lattice oxygen and absorbed oxygen.

The OER performances of the as-prepared samples were measured in a N2-saturated 1 M KOH solution. Fig. 5a shows the steady-state linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curve of the Ni<sub>2/3</sub>Fe<sub>1/3</sub>O/Ni<sub>4/3</sub>Fe<sub>2/3</sub>P composite compared with those of the Ni<sub>2/3</sub>Fe<sub>1/3</sub>O and Ni<sub>4/3</sub>Fe<sub>2/3</sub>P catalysts. Obviously, the Ni<sub>2/3</sub>Fe<sub>1/3</sub>O/ Ni<sub>4/3</sub>Fe<sub>2/3</sub>P nanoflakes showed the highest activity among these electrocatalysts. It is notable that the current density (e.g. 92.0 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> at 1.6 V vs. RHE) achieved by the Ni<sub>2/3</sub>Fe<sub>1/3</sub>O/ Ni<sub>4/3</sub>Fe<sub>2/3</sub>P composite is larger than the sum of those of the individual  $Ni_{2/3}Fe_{1/3}O$  and  $Ni_{4/3}Fe_{2/3}P$  materials (61.5 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>). This difference may be ascribed to the synergistic effects originating from the heterointerface, by which the energetic barrier for each step of the water oxidation was reduced.<sup>31</sup> In addition, it is found that further increase in the mass ratio of NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>2</sub> to Ni<sub>2/3</sub>Fe<sub>1/3</sub>O precursor up to 10, the as-attained Ni<sub>4/3</sub>Fe<sub>2/3</sub>P-2 showed unexpectedly lower activity than Ni<sub>4/3</sub>Fe<sub>2/3</sub>P-1. The excess phosphorus source may lead to the deposition of phosphate on the catalyst. In addition, it is observed that the 2D nanoflake-like morphology of the asattained Ni<sub>4/3</sub>Fe<sub>2/3</sub>P-2 is almost destroyed, which has adverse effect on the electrocatalytic activity (Fig. S3b).† Fig. 5b shows the overpotential values of these electrocatalysts reaches the current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> (equivalent to the transformation efficiency in artificial photosynthesis). Ni<sub>2/3</sub>Fe<sub>1/3</sub>O/ Ni<sub>4/3</sub>Fe<sub>2/3</sub>P composite exhibits a lower overpotential of 273 mV than  $Ni_{2/3}Fe_{1/3}O$  (310 mV),  $Ni_{4/3}Fe_{2/3}P-1$  (352 mV) and Ni<sub>4/3</sub>Fe<sub>2/3</sub>P-2 (360 mV). Fig. 5c shows the corresponding Tafel plots, which were calculated from the Tafel equation  $\eta = a +$  $b \log j$  (wherein  $\eta$  is the overpotential, j represents the current

density, a stands for a constant and b is the Tafel slope). The Tafel slope of Ni<sub>2/3</sub>Fe<sub>1/3</sub>O/Ni<sub>4/3</sub>Fe<sub>2/3</sub>P is 79 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>, which is close to 77 mV dec<sup>-1</sup> of Ni<sub>2/3</sub>Fe<sub>1/3</sub>O and significantly smaller than that of  $Ni_{4/3}Fe_{2/3}P-1$  (85 mV  $dec^{-1}$ ) and  $Ni_{4/3}Fe_{2/3}P-2$ (93 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>), thus revealing favorable reaction kinetics. It is well known that the electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) of the electrocatalyst could be represented by twice of the double-layer capacitance (2  $\times$   $C_{
m dl}$ ). Fig. 5d shows the current density difference as a function of the scan rate, while the CV curves are depicted in Fig. S5.† The ECSA was therefore calculated to be 21.17 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>, which was much larger than 5.74 mF cm<sup>-2</sup> for Ni<sub>2/3</sub>Fe<sub>1/3</sub>O and 2.43 mF cm<sup>-2</sup> for Ni<sub>4/3</sub>Fe<sub>2/3</sub>P, thus revealing accessibility to more active sites. This result coincided with the activity order of the as-prepared electrocatalysts, indicating that ECSA might be the crucial factor for the high activity of the Ni<sub>2/3</sub>Fe<sub>1/3</sub>O/Ni<sub>4/3</sub>Fe<sub>2/3</sub>P composite. Fig. 5e depicts the Nyquist plots of the as-prepared electrocatalysts. The superior OER activity of Ni<sub>2/3</sub>Fe<sub>1/3</sub>O/Ni<sub>4/3</sub>Fe<sub>2/3</sub>P composite can be proved by the smallest charge transfer resistance ( $R_{\rm ct}$  = 19.6  $\Omega$ ), which may be related to the electronic structure modulation originating from the Ni<sub>2/3</sub>Fe<sub>1/3</sub>O/Ni<sub>4/3</sub>Fe<sub>2/3</sub>P heterointerfaces. Moreover, long-term durability has been considered as another indispensable indicator for high-performance electrocatalysts. Fig. 5f indicates a chronopotentiometric curve of the Ni<sub>2/3</sub>Fe<sub>1/3</sub>O/ Ni<sub>4/3</sub>Fe<sub>2/3</sub>P heterostructure at a constant current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. The potential showed no obvious change at  $\sim$ 1.49 V vs. RHE in a continuous water oxidation process up to 10 h, revealing a rather stable durability for the Ni<sub>2/3</sub>Fe<sub>1/3</sub>O/Ni<sub>4/3</sub>Fe<sub>2/3</sub>P composite.

## Conclusions

In conclusion, a low-cost and highly efficient  $Ni_{2/3}Fe_{1/3}O/Ni_{4/3}Fe_{2/3}P$  heterostructure with a well-defined 2D nanoflake-like morphology was successfully synthesized by the low temperature phosphidation of the corresponding Ni–Fe oxide precursor. Based on the elaborately designed structure and composition, the 2D  $Ni_{2/3}Fe_{1/3}O/Ni_{4/3}Fe_{2/3}P$  composite yielded the current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> at a low overpotential of 273 mV with a small Tafel slope of 79 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>, superior to that of  $Ni_{2/3}Fe_{1/3}O$  and  $Ni_{4/3}Fe_{2/3}P$  nanoflakes. This study has uncovered the significance of elaborately designing nanostructured electrocatalysts for efficient electrochemical energy conversion.

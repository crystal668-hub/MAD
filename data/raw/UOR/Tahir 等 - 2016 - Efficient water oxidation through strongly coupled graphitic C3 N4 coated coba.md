The development of low cost and durable electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) for water splitting remains a great challenge. Here, we developed strongly coupled hybrid nanowires (NWs) of anion (Cl<sup>-</sup> and CO<sup>-</sup>) doped cobalt hydroxide coated with nanosheets of graphitic carbon nitride (Co(OH)<sub>2</sub>@g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>) through an *in situ* hydrothermal method. With 5% g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> added in the synthesis, we obtained perfectly coated Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> by g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> nanosheets with an overall diameter of ~110 nm and a coating layer of ~10 nm. The structural and compositional analyses confirm the strong interaction between g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> and Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> that makes the hybrid highly effective for the OER. As a result Co(OH)<sub>2</sub>@g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> NWs exhibit an excellent over-potential of 0.32 V at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> as well as extraordinary stability, which are better than those of the state-of-the-art noble metals (IrO<sub>2</sub> and RuO<sub>2</sub>) and most reported Co- and C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>-based electrocatalysts although both Co(OH)<sub>2</sub>@g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> and Pt/C delivers a current density of 80 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> at 1.9 V for overall water splitting.

## Introduction

Oxygen electrocatalysis is a fundamental reaction in various energy conversion/storage applications such as electrochemical water splitting. Among various oxygen reactions, oxygen evolution reaction (OER) got tremendous attention due to its challenging sluggish reaction kinetics induced by the multistep proton coupled electron transfer. A good design of electrocatalyst for the OER is highly desirable to overcome the limitation of practical usage of water splitting. Noble metal oxides *e.g.* IrO<sub>2</sub> and RuO<sub>2</sub> are used for industrial applications although they have disadvantages of high cost, low abundance and poor stability. <sup>1-6</sup> Efforts have been undertaken to replace the Ir- and Ru-based catalysts with low cost metals or metal free catalysts, but complicated synthesis methods and structural disintegration are the main issues especially with metal oxides.

Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>) has recently garnered tremendous attention due to its excellent stable electrochemical properties, low cost and morphology tailoring.7-10 However, due to low surface area and inherent low electrical conductivity, g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> is mainly restricted to the OER. Therefore, it is more than ideal and highly desirable to enhance its efficiency in order to make it practically applicable. One of the possible ways is to increase or create more active sites for the OER. Co-based materials got tremendous attention due to their fascinating physical and chemical properties. It is well known that Co<sup>2+</sup> and Co3+ are the active sites for the OER.11-26 Thus, combining g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> and Co-based materials into a hybrid structure to get the advantages of their respective active sites is an ideal way to lower the energy barrier for oxygen evolution. Furthermore, it may also result in a new active site of Co-N that will boost up the OER activity with higher efficiency.<sup>27</sup> In order to realize the aforementioned concept, the construction of the hybrid with an intact interface between g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> and Co-based materials and their easy access are very critical. Along with this, developing nanostructures containing aqueous ions to increase the electrode wettability improves the ionic conductivity and enhances the redox activity which are also very helpful for the OER.<sup>22-28</sup> Thus, it is believed that such a hybrid nanostructure with unique characteristics has great potential to replace expensive and scarce noble metals for the OER.24-30

Here, we have developed a distinctive catalyst for the OER based on chloride and carbonate anions containing cobalt hydroxide (for simplicity we used Co(OH)<sub>2</sub>) nanowires (NWs)

coated by g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> layers (Co(OH)<sub>2</sub>@g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>) through a facile hydrothermal process. Surprisingly the resultant hybrid shows excellent OER activity that is attributed to the strong coupling of Co(OH)2 and g-C3N4, although the individual materials show very low activity. Co(OH)2@g-C3N4 exhibits an overpotential of 0.32 V at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> in 1 M KOH, and surpasses noble metal catalysts (e.g., IrO2 and RuO2) and most reported Co- and C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>-based electrocatalysts. Furthermore, Co(OH)2@g-C3N4 exhibits excellent stability and a high efficiency of 98.9% after 36 000 s for the OER. Thus, these results prove that Co(OH)<sub>2</sub>(a)g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> hybrid NWs are strong candidates for the OER and will open up an avenue for the development of new catalyst materials.

## **Experimental**

#### Fabrication of g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> nanosheets

g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> nanosheets were prepared by the pyrolysis of urea.<sup>2,7</sup> Typically, 5.0 g of urea were ground into a powder and calcined at 550 °C for 4 h at a heating rate of 5.0 °C min<sup>-1</sup> in air. After cooling, the yellow solids were obtained and crushed into powders for further processing.

### Fabrication of Co(OH)2@g-C3N4 hybrid NWs

In order to synthesize Co(OH)<sub>2</sub>@g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> hybrid NWs, 714 mg of CoCl<sub>2</sub>·6H<sub>2</sub>O, 180 mg of CO(NH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub> and a desired amount of g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> nanosheets were mixed together in 20 mL of deionized H<sub>2</sub>O. The mixture was sonicated for 1 h, then transferred to a 50 mL autoclave and heated at 100 °C for 12 h. The obtained product was washed with water and ethanol and then dried at 60 °C for 24 h. Co(OH)2 NWs are also synthesized by a similar method without adding g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> nanosheets. Furthermore, a mixture is fabricated by simple physical mixing of 5% g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> nanosheets with Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> NWs. The names of the samples are given according to the amount of g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>; for example, Co(OH)<sub>2</sub>@g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>-5 NW means that 5% g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> nanosheets are added during the fabrication of Co(OH)2 NWs, whereas Co(OH)<sub>2</sub>/g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> means that the sample is fabricated through simple physical mixing (Table S1†).

#### OER test

All the electrochemical measurements were conducted using an IVIUMSTAT work station (Ivium Technologies BV, Netherlands) in a typical three-electrode setup with an electrolyte solution, a graphite rod as the counter electrode and Hg/HgO as the reference electrode. A glassy carbon electrode with a diameter of 3 mm covered by a thin catalyst film was used as the working electrode. Typically, 4 mg catalyst was suspended in 1 mL ethanol and 15 µL Nafion solution to form a homogeneous ink. Then 5 µL of the ink was spread onto the surface of the glassy carbon electrode by a micropipette and dried at room temperature. Electrochemical measurements were conducted in 1 M KOH. For Linear Sweep Voltammetry (LSV) measurements, the scan rate was 5 mV s<sup>-1</sup>.

#### Overall water splitting test

For overall water splitting we used a Co(OH)2@g-C3N4-5 NW hybrid as the OER electrode and Pt/C as the HER (hydrogen evolution reaction) electrode. The as-prepared homogeneous ink of Co(OH)2@g-C3N4-5 NW hybrid and Pt/C are pasted at 1 × 1 cm Ni foam. The Ni foam was previously washed with water and ethanol, and dried overnight. 1 M KOH was used as the electrolyte.

#### Characterizations

X-ray diffraction (XRD) was recorded with a Bruker D8 Focus operating at 40 kV and 40 mA equipped with nickel-filtered Cu Kα radiation ( $\lambda = 1.54056 \text{ Å}$ ) and operating in a  $2\theta$  range of 10-90° at a scanning rate of 0.02° per step. Field emission-scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) images were obtained using a Hitachi S-4800 SEM. TEM images were obtained using a JEM-2100F transmission electron microscope at 200 kV. The BET surface area was determined using N2 adsorption/desorption isotherm measurements at −196 °C on a Micrometrics TriStar 3000 equipment. The surface composition and chemical states were analyzed using a PHI-1600 X-ray photoelectron spectroscope (XPS) equipped with Al Ka radiation.

## Results and discussion

The in situ coating of g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> nanosheets on Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> is done through a simple and scalable hydrothermal method as shown in Scheme 1. In the first step, g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> nanosheets were produced through thermal annealing and in the next step the in situ growth of Co(OH)2@g-C3N4 NWs was carried out through the hydrothermal process using cobalt salt and urea as the starting precursors. The structures of the as-synthesized products were characterized using X-ray diffraction spectroscopy as shown in Fig. 1a. The clear and sharp peak at 26° confirms the high graphitization degree of the as-prepared g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> nanosheets.<sup>2,8</sup> Similarly, the XRD spectrum of Co(OH)2 NWs confirms its purity and crystallinity as all the peaks are well-matched with the standard card of  $Co(CO)_{0.35}Cl_{0.20}(OH)_{1.10}$  (JCDPS 38-0547).<sup>31</sup> The XRD spectrum of  $Co(OH)_2$ @g- $C_3N_4$  is similar to that of pure Co(OH)2 NWs. However, no peak of g-C3N4 is found in the hybrid due to its good dispersion. Furthermore, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) is employed to determine the exact amount of g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> in various Co(OH)<sub>2</sub>(a)g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>. The TGA curves of  $Co(OH)_2$ ,  $Co(OH)_2@g-C_3N_4-2$ ,  $Co(OH)_2@g-C_3N_4-5$  and Co(OH)<sub>2</sub>(a)g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>-7 are given in Fig. 1b and the weight losses of 24, 26, 29 and 31% are observed, respectively. These weight

Fig. 1 (a) XRD spectra of  $g-C_3N_4$ , Co(OH)<sub>2</sub>, Co(OH)<sub>2</sub>@ $g-C_3N_4$  NWs and Co(OH)<sub>2</sub>/ $g-C_3N_4$ ; (b) TGA curves of Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> and Co(OH)<sub>2</sub>@ $g-C_3N_4$  NWs.

losses are consistent with the amount of g- $C_3N_4$  added in the synthesis as the hybrid shows 2, 5 and 7% g- $C_3N_4$  when the weight loss of pure  $Co(OH)_2$  is subtracted. The larger weight loss in pure  $Co(OH)_2$  is because of the removal of anions and water molecules.

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to characterize the morphological aspects of the as-synthesized materials. From Fig. 2a, it is obvious that g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> possesses a sheet like morphology with overall nanoscale dimensions. Fig. 2b represents the wire like morphology of pure Co(OH)2 with a high aspect ratio. The HRTEM image of Co(OH)2 NWs is shown in Fig. S1,† where the NWs are grown in a quasi-single crystalline pattern of Co and the inter-planar distance of 0.499 corresponds to 17.44° according to standard card no. JDPS 38-0547. The hybrids constructed with different concentrations of g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> nanosheets are shown in Fig. 2c and d and 3. It can be seen that the NWs of Co(OH)<sub>2</sub>@g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>-2 being partially coated with g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> nanosheets (Fig. 2c and S2†) might be due to the lower concentration of nanosheets (2%). However, the coating of g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> nanosheets on the NWs is confirmed by HRTEM analysis (inset of Fig. 2c). To attain better uniformity of the nanosheet coating on the NWs the concentration of the nanosheets is increased to 5% (Co(OH)<sub>2</sub>@g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>-5). Well-coated NWs, as presented in Fig. 3, appear without any individual

nanosheets or/and as bare NWs. Whereas further increase in the amount of g- $C_3N_4$  nanosheets up to 7% results in several separated nanosheets (Fig. 2d). For an additional comparative analysis a physical mixture of nanosheets and NWs was also prepared. Individual nanosheets and NWs are found in the TEM image (Fig. S3†), and HRTEM studies depict that there is no coating of nanosheets on NWs as only a well-crystalline NW surface can be observed (Fig. S4†).

To further confirm the uniformity of coating and surface features of Co(OH)2@g-C3N4-5 detailed TEM analyses were performed as delineated in Fig. 3. The Co(OH)2@g-C3N4-5 possesses features similar to those of the pure one but interestingly with a rough surface because of the g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> coating on their surface (Fig. 3a). The NWs with a diameter of  $\sim$ 110 nm are grown in one dimension and confirm the presence of quasisingle-crystalline cobalt, which is well-aligned through the entire NWs. The high magnification TEM image clearly shows the coating of g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> nanosheets with the thickness of 5-10 nm (Fig. 3b). HRTEM studies were also performed to confirm the structure and the nature of NWs as shown in Fig. 3c. It clearly shows the existence of an amorphous coating on the surface which corresponds to g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> and confirms the homogeneous and complete coverage of full NWs. The elemental line profile and the STEM image were recorded to further confirm the homogeneity of the coating as shown in Fig. 3d and S5,† respectively. The elemental distribution lines for C (red) and Co (black) confirm that the hybrid NWs have a consistent chemical composition throughout the entire NWs with higher carbon at the edges and the Co rich core of NWs. Therefore, the higher concentration of carbon at the edges proves that g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> is homogeneously coated on the NWs. The surface area and the pore radius play a critical role in determining the electrocatalytic activity and thus Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) and BJH adsorption analyses were performed as shown in Fig. S6 and S7.† The surface areas of Co(OH)2, Co(OH)2@g-C3N4-2,  $Co(OH)_2@gC_3N_4$ -5 and  $Co(OH)_2@g-C_3N_4$ -7 NWs are 5, 16, 18 and 22 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. The increased surface area assures the better access of redox sites and the easy penetration of the electrolyte.

In order to evaluate the nature of chemical bonding and the composition of the as synthesized materials XPS studies were conducted (Fig. 4). The full scan XPS spectra of Co(OH)2@g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>-5 NWs disclose the presence of the core levels of C, N, Cl, O

Fig. 4 (a) Full-scan XPS spectra of Co(OH)<sub>2</sub>@g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>-5, high-resolution; (b) C 1s of  $g-C_3N_4$  and  $Co(OH)_2@g-C_3N_4-5$ ; (c) N 1s of  $g-C_3N_4$ and  $Co(OH)_2@g-C_3N_4-5$ ; and (d) Co 2p spectra of  $Co(OH)_2$  and  $Co(OH)_2@g-C_3N_4-5$ 

and Co (Fig. 4a). Fig. 4b clearly shows the existence of graphitic C=C (~283.7 eV) and C-N=C bonds (~288.4 eV) for both Co(OH)<sub>2</sub>@g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>-5 and g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> while one extra peak at  $\sim$ 284.8 eV (C-O) for Co(OH)<sub>2</sub>@g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>-5 only.<sup>30,31</sup> The presence of the C-O bond assures that the g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> coating has strong interaction with Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> NWs. As shown in Fig. 4c, there is one extra peak at 399.0 eV corresponding to Co-N in Co(OH)2@g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>-5. Three peaks corresponding to pyridinic-N, N-C and quaternary-N according to their binding energies of 397.8, 398.4 and 400.0 eV, respectively are present in both g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> and Co(OH)<sub>2</sub>(a)g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>-5.<sup>5,30,32</sup> The presence of Co-N further confirms the strong interaction between g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> nanosheets and Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> NWs by the formation of the coating. And these nitrogen centers are very effective towards the OER and especially the existence of the Co-N bond will benefit with a faster redox process.30 Fig. 4d presents the high resolution spectrum of Co 2p, from which it is clear that cobalt exists in multiple oxidation states of Co<sup>2+</sup> and Co<sup>3+</sup> as confirmed by the larger binding energy gap than 15.0 eV (peaks appeared at 780.3 and 796.9 eV) and merged satellite peaks in Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> and Co(OH)<sub>2</sub>@g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>-5. Furthermore there is an additional shoulder peak around 781.5 eV corresponding to the Co-N bond in Co(OH)2@g-C3N4-5,32-34 which again indicates the strong chemical coupling among the components of the hybrid. In contrast, pure g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> does not have such a N-Co bond and pure Co(OH)2 does not have the Co-N bond. Thus the existence of Co-N and N-O bonds in the hybrid confirms that it is not just a physical mixture but has strong chemical interactions and these chemical interactions create additional active sites for OER.

Co(OH)2@g-C3N4 hybrid NWs were tested as catalysts for the OER in a 1 M KOH aqueous solution. Fig. 5a and S8† show the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves of g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>, Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> NWs and  $Co(OH)_2 \otimes g - C_3 N_4$  hybrid NWs with 2, 5 and 7% of  $g - C_3 N_4$ , which show the onset potentials of 1.65, 1.65, 1.48, 1.47 and 1.49 V, respectively. From Fig. 5a, it is clear that both the individual g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> and Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> NWs deliver high onset potential and poor current densities, but when they are combined in the hybrid structure better catalytic activity results. It is also found that by increasing the content of g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> the hybrid delivers better performance. However, an excessive increase in g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> lowers the performance which might be due to the higher thickness resulting in slower ionic transport or limiting the free electrolyte penetration. In addition, both at higher and lower concentrations there is existence of extra sheets and bare NWs that affect the synergy of hybrid nanostructures. To further confirm the synergy of g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> and Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> NWs, their physical mixture was also tested and it performs a little better than the individual components but exhibits lower performance than the hybrid structure. Thus, the higher performance of the hybrid is attributed to the strong electrochemical coupling between g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> and Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> NWs that creates new active sites along with the integral active sites (Co-N, pyridinic N, quaternary N, Co2+ and Co3+). Also the engineered structure and composition of Co(OH)2@g-C3N4 hybrid NWs with discrete spaces enable easy access of the redox sites. Furthermore, the coating with g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> nanosheets leads to faster electron transfer from the redox sites to the electron collector and vice versa,

Fig. 5 (a) LSV curves of  $g-C_3N_4$ ,  $Co(OH)_2/g-C_3N_4$ ,  $Co(OH)_2$  and  $Co(OH)_2@g-C_3N_4$  NWs; (b) LSV curves of  $Co(OH)_2@g-C_3N_4-5$ ,  $RuO_2$ ,  $IrO_2$  and Pt/C.

which results in overall improved electronic conductivity of the hybrid.

Fig. 5b and S9† present the LSV curves of Co(OH)<sub>2</sub>@g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>-5, RuO2 and IrO2, in which the over-potentials needed to reach 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> are 1.55, 1.58 and 1.65 V respectively, whereas Pt/C does not reach the required current density. Fig. S10† shows the over-potential values at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, from which it is clear that the hybrid possesses the smallest over-potential of 320 mV compared to those of RuO<sub>2</sub> (350 mV) and IrO<sub>2</sub> (420 mV). Table S2† presents the comparison of over-potentials at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> for all samples and Table S3† provides the comparison of the over-potential at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> of Co(OH)<sub>2</sub>@g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>-5 and the recently reported best results. It is worth-mentioning that Co(OH)<sub>2</sub>@g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>-5 delivers the best performance compared to the noble metal and recently reported Co- and g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> based catalysts for the OER. These results clearly show that the hybrid exhibits exceptional OER activity and outperforms the state-ofthe-art noble metals or/and metal oxides.

To further explore the advantages of hybrid structure and OER kinetics, the Tafel slope was determined as shown in Fig. 6a.  $Co(OH)_2@g-C_3N_4-5$  shows the Tafel slope value of 59 mV  $dec^{-1}$  that indicates the favorable kinetics for the OER. Even

Fig. 6 (a) Tafel slope of  $Co(OH)_2@g-C_3N_4-5$ ,  $RuO_2$ ,  $IrO_2$  and Pt/C; (b) stability and efficiency of  $Co(OH)_2@g-C_3N_4-5$  at 10 mA cm $^{-2}$ .

 ${\rm Co(OH)_2@g\text{-}C_3N_4\text{-}5}$  possesses a better Tafel slope value (59 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>) than the noble catalysts such as  ${\rm IrO_2}$  (65 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>) and  ${\rm RuO_2}$  (90 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>), which confirms that the hybrid has better ionic and electronic conductivities to facilitate the oxygen catalysis in a better way. From the Nyquist plots, it is obvious that the hybrid offers the lowest charge transfer resistance as it bears the smallest semicircle compared to all other samples (Fig. S11†). Furthermore, it is also clear that only a strong chemical connection between g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> and  ${\rm Co(OH)_2}$  NWs will bring an improvement in their electrocatalytic properties, not a simple mixture of these two components.

The long term stability and corresponding efficiency of an electrocatalyst are highly important for its practical applications. Therefore the longevity of Co(OH)<sub>2</sub>@g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>-5 was measured at the potential value where it can achieve the current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> for 36 000 s as shown in Fig. 6b. It is obvious that the Co(OH)<sub>2</sub>@g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>-5 hybrid NWs do not show any notable change in the potential values and bear a high efficiency of 98.9%, which confirms that the hybrid is a very stable and efficient electrocatalyst for the OER in an alkaline solution.

To further analyze the importance of the  $Co(OH)_2@g-C_3N_4-5$  electrocatalyst for practical applications, complete water-splitting was done as shown in Fig. 7. A two electrode system is designed by using  $Co(OH)_2@g-C_3N_4-5$  as the anode and Pt/C as

Fig. 7 Overall water splitting using Co(OH)<sub>2</sub>@g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>-5 as the OER catalyst and Pt/C as the HER catalyst.

the cathode due to their excellent OER and HER activities, respectively. The electrolysis of water to oxygen and hydrogen is done with an excellent current density of 80 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> at 1.9 V, which proves that Co(OH)2@g-C3N4-5 has great potential for commercial use to generate the energy from water-splitting. Furthermore, a low potential value of 1.56 V to attain 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> is observed, which further emphasizes that the hybrid has the ability to replace the expensive rare earth metal catalysts to commercialize the water-splitting electrolyzer more efficiently.

## Conclusions

In summary, we have successfully fabricated g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> coated anion-containing Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> NWs for the OER through a simple and industrial acceptable in situ hydrothermal method. The perfect coating structure builds a strong synergy between Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> NWs and g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> nanosheets. The formation of new active sites (Co-N) between g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> and Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> boosts up the electrocatalytic activity of the hybrid. Co(OH)<sub>2</sub>@g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>-5 hybrid NWs exhibit an excellent onset-potential of 1.47 V and show an over-potential of 0.32 V at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> as well as extraordinary stability as an electrocatalyst for OER which are even better than those of the state-of-the-art noble metal species (IrO2, RuO2 and Pt/C) along with recently reported Co- and g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> based catalysts. Furthermore, Co(OH)2@g-C3N4-5 hybrid NWs deliver a current density of 80 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> at 1.9 V as the OER catalyst for overall water splitting.

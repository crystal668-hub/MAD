# Hierarchical Fe-doped Ni<sub>3</sub>Se<sub>4</sub> ultrathin nanosheets as an efficient electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction†

Jing Du, (10 \*a,b Zehua Zou, a Chen Liuc and Cailing Xu\*a

Developing highly efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts is critical to the cost-effective generation of clean fuels. Transition-metal selenides have been proposed to be OER catalyst alternatives to noble metal based catalysts, but generally exhibit limited electrocatalytic activity. We here report hierarchical Fe-doped Ni<sub>3</sub>Se<sub>4</sub> ((Ni,Fe)<sub>3</sub>Se<sub>4</sub>) ultrathin nanosheets as an efficient electrocatalyst for OER in alkaline electrolytes. The preparation involves a solvothermal synthesis and a topotactic conversion process. The prepared hierarchical (Ni,Fe)<sub>3</sub>Se<sub>4</sub> ultrathin nanosheets show abundant and accessible catalytically active sites, facile charge transfer and a high specific surface area. Relative to the Ni<sub>3</sub>Se<sub>4</sub> nanosheets, the as-prepared (Ni,Fe)<sub>3</sub>Se<sub>4</sub> ultrathin nanosheets show a higher current density and a lower Tafel slope towards the OER. Remarkably, hierarchical (Ni,Fe)<sub>3</sub>Se<sub>4</sub> ultrathin nanosheets supported on Ni foam exhibit an electrocatalytic OER with a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> at a low overpotential of 225 mV and a small Tafel slope of about 41 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>. This study establishes (Ni,Fe)<sub>3</sub>Se<sub>4</sub> ultrathin nanosheets as an efficient electrocatalyst for the OER that can be used in the fields of metal-air batteries and water splitting for hydrogen production.

## Introduction

Achieving efficient catalysis of the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) plays a key role in various devices of electrochemical energy storage and conversion including artificial photosynthesis, rechargeable metal–air batteries and water splitting for hydrogen production. <sup>1–5</sup> Precious metal electrocatalysts such as IrO<sub>2</sub> and RuO<sub>2</sub> are known to exhibit the best overall catalytic performance for the OER, but their limited availability and high price prohibit them from mass applications. <sup>6</sup> Thus, extensive research efforts have been dedicated to developing alternative catalysts based on non-noble elements for catalyzing the OER. Innumerable materials based on transition metal oxides, <sup>7–9</sup> phosphides, <sup>10,11</sup>

chalcogenides, 12-14 nitrides, 15,16 and two-dimensional layered

Despite the recent excellent performances toward the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction reported for nickel-based selenide nanosheets, <sup>25–29</sup> systematic investigations on the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction by Ni<sub>3</sub>Se<sub>4</sub> ultrathin nanosheets have to the best of our knowledge rarely been reported. <sup>30</sup> Importantly, it has been reported that the electrochemical performance of mixed transition-metal-based materials can often be favorably superior to the single-metal counterparts in metal oxides, sulfides and phosphides in the area of OER. <sup>31,32</sup> The improved electrochemical activity is related to the enhanced charge transfer between the foreign

double hydroxides  $^{17-19}$  have demonstrated their potential as efficient OER catalysts. Among them, nickel-, cobalt-, and ironbased two-dimensional ultrathin materials have attracted much attention as cost-effective alternatives to precious metal based catalysts.  $^{13,20,21}$  The advantage of these ultrathin 2D-layered sheets is their nanometer/sub-nanometer planar thickness, which facilitates the accessibility of exposed active "edge sites" and increases accessible surfaces to promote the contact between the electrolyte and active sites on their surfaces.  $^{22,23}$  It is reported that  $\rm NiCo_2O_4$  ultrathin nanosheets (thickness of 1.6 nm) show a current density that is approximately 3 times larger than that of the bulk sample,  $^{24}$  which further confirms the key role of the ultrathin 2D nanosheet structure in the catalytic performance.

elements and host and the increased number of active sites by modulating the local electronic structures of the host materials. 11,31 Previously, the enhanced OER performances of nickel selenides have been reported by introducing another transition metal. For example, porous (Ni<sub>0.75</sub>Fe<sub>0.25</sub>)Se<sub>2</sub> nanosheets on carbon fiber cloth deliver improved OER activity with fast charge transportation, exhibiting a small overpotential of 255 mV at 35 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> and a low Tafel slope of 47.2 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>, <sup>28</sup> which can be attributed to the Fe incorporation. (Ni, Co)<sub>0.85</sub>Se nanotube arrays on a carbon fabric collector exhibit a low overpotential of 255 mV at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> and a Tafel slope of 79 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>. 33 NiFe-Se/C composite nanorod supported on Ni foam needs an overpotential of 240 mV to drive the current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> for OER in 1.0 M KOH.<sup>34</sup> Amorphous Fe-NiSe nanowires on Ni foam require an overpotential of 233 mV to drive the current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> and show a low Tafel slope of 48 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>.35 In the previous work, the most reported bimetal based nickel selenides are NiSe and NiSe<sub>2</sub>. In this study, we focus on the different stoichiometry of nickel selenide (Ni<sub>3</sub>Se<sub>4</sub>). The Ni<sub>3</sub>Se<sub>4</sub> attracted our attention because of its higher electrical conductivity than other nickel selenides such as NiSe and NiSe2.36-38 Moreover, seldom studies have been focused on the OER performance of the chemically doped Ni<sub>3</sub>Se<sub>4</sub>.

Herein, we demonstrate the solvothermal synthesis of Ni<sub>3</sub>Se<sub>4</sub> and (Ni,Fe)<sub>3</sub>Se<sub>4</sub> with an ultrathin nanosheet morphology for highly efficient oxygen evolution reaction. The prepared selenide nanosheet exhibits a layered structure with a lateral size of several hundred nanometers and a thickness about 2.5 nm. Benefiting from the increased accessible surfaces, more active sites, large surface area of 75 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>, and enhanced mass/charge transfer, the (Ni,Fe)3Se4 ultrathin nanosheets exhibited higher OER catalytic activity than the undoped Ni<sub>3</sub>Se<sub>4</sub>, featured by the overpotential of 225 mV at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> and a small Tafel slope of 41 mV dec<sup>-1</sup> for (Ni, Fe)<sub>3</sub>Se<sub>4</sub> in alkaline solution. Using (Ni,Fe)<sub>3</sub>Se<sub>4</sub> ultrathin nanosheets as a bifunctional electrocatalyst, the overall-watersplitting performance in basic media with a low voltage of 1.60 V at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> and long-term stability was achieved, which is comparable or even superior to those reported for transition-metal based materials.

# **Experimental section**

### Material synthesis

Chemical reagents ferrous nitrate, nickel chloride, trisodium citrate, urea, sodium tetrahydroborate, and selenium were used without any additional purification. Iridium oxide (IrO<sub>2</sub>), ethanol (99.9%) and Nafion (5% in a mixture of lower aliphatic alcohols and water) were purchased from Alfa Aesar.

Synthesis of the NiFe based nanosheet precursor (NiFe-LDH): The NiFe-LDH nanosheet precursor was prepared by a hydrothermal method.<sup>32</sup> In a typical synthesis, the precursor was first synthesized by adding 1.45 mL nickel chloride aqueous solution (1 M) and 0.145 mL ferrous nitrate aqueous

solution (1 M) in 70.8 mL deionized water. Subsequently, 5.6 ml of 0.5 M urea and 2 ml of 0.01 M trisodium citrate aqueous solution were added and the resulting solution was vigorously stirred for 0.5 h. The obtained mixture solution was transferred to a 100 mL Teflon-lined autoclave. The autoclave was placed in an oven at 150 °C for 24 h. After being cooled and depressurized, the obtained suspensions were centrifuged, washed and vacuum-dried.

Synthesis of NiFe based selenide nanosheets: Se powder (0.059 g) was added into deionized water (1.5 mL) containing NaBH<sub>4</sub> (0.065 g). After ultrasonic dissolving for 5 minutes, a clear NaHSe solution was obtained. Then, 40 mg of NiFe precursor was dispersed into 30 ml of ethanol, followed by the addition of the freshly prepared NaHSe solution under a N2 flow. Thereafter, the mixture was transferred into a Teflonlined stainless steel autoclave, which was subsequently heated at 140 °C for 16 h. After the autoclave was cooled down to room temperature, the sample was centrifuged, washed and vacuum-dried. And then the (Ni,Fe)3Se4 nanosheets were obtained.

In comparison, Ni<sub>3</sub>Se<sub>4</sub> nanosheets were also prepared by the same synthetic method without adding ferrous nitrate aqueous solution.

#### Material characterization

The crystal structure of the prepared samples was characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku D/max 2400 X-ray generator, Cu K $\alpha$  radiation,  $\lambda = 1.5406$  Å) at a scanning rate of 6° min<sup>-1</sup> from 10 to 80°. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed on a Hitachi S-4800 microscope (operating voltage, 7 kV). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high resolution TEM (HRTEM) were carried out on a Philips Tecnai F20 operated at 200 kV. The atomic force microscopy (AFM) sample was prepared by dropping the catalyst suspension onto a silicon wafer and was characterized using NanoScope. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data were collected on a PHI-5702 instrument. The stoichiometric ratio of Ni/Fe/Se in the (Ni,Fe)<sub>3</sub>Se<sub>4</sub> sample was measured by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (IRIS ER/S, Thermo Jarrell-Ash Corp). Nitrogen adsorption-desorption measurements were recorded on a BEL-Mini adsorption analyzer.

#### **Electrochemical tests**

All electrochemical measurements were conducted using a computer-controlled CHI 760E electrochemistry workstation at room temperature. A standard three electrode system consisting of a working electrode, a saturated calomel electrode (SCE), and a graphite rod counter electrode was used for the OER and HER tests. The working electrode was a glass carbon electrode (5.0 mm in diameter) coated with a thin layer of catalyst, which was prepared by ultrasonically mixing 5.0 mg of the as-prepared catalyst with 500 µL of ethanol and 30 µL of Nafion solution for 25 min in order to form a homogeneous slurry. Then, 14.0 µL of the prepared slurry was loaded onto the surface of a glass carbon electrode using a micropipette.

Finally, the electrode was allowed to dry for 10 h under ambient conditions to form a thin catalyst film. Catalyst loading is approximately 0.673 mg cm<sup>-2</sup> on the glass carbon electrode. For comparison, the electrocatalytic activity of the benchmark IrO2 was also investigated under the same conditions. Ni foam  $(1 \times 1 \text{ cm})$  was also utilized as the working electrode to reach a high catalyst loading and investigate the electrocatalytic performance. 150 µL of the above prepared slurry was dropped on Ni foam and left to dry at room temperature. The catalyst loading is about 1.5 mg cm<sup>-2</sup> on the Ni foam electrode. Linear sweep voltammetry was carried out at a scan rate of 5 mV s<sup>-1</sup> in 1.0 M aqueous KOH electrolyte. All the polarization curves have been iR-corrected. Unless otherwise stated, all potentials were converted to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) potential in all measurements. In 1.0 M KOH solution, the potential of SCE was calibrated as +1.06 V with respect to RHE. Electrochemical impedance spectra were obtained over a frequency range of 100 kHz to 10 mHz at a direct-current bias potential of 1.50 V at room temperature. Chronopotentiometry was carried out under a constant current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> in 1.0 M KOH solution to evaluate the catalyst durability. Overall water splitting was performed in a single compartment, two electrode cell using nickel foam electrodes with dimensions of  $1.0 \times 1.0 \text{ cm}^2$  (geometric area = 1.0 cm<sup>2</sup>) modified with (Ni,Fe)<sub>3</sub>Se<sub>4</sub> or Ni<sub>3</sub>Se<sub>4</sub> ultrathin nanosheets with a loading of approximately 1.0 mg cm<sup>2</sup> as the catalysts for both the anode and the cathode.

#### Calculation method

The electrochemical double-layer capacitance  $(C_{dl})$  was estimated by plotting the difference between the anodic and cathodic current densities ( $\Delta j = j_a - j_c$ ) at 1.11 V vs. RHE against the scan rate. The resulting linear slope is twice the  $C_{\rm dl}$ . The ECSA can be calculated according to the following equation:

$$ECSA = C_{\rm dl}/C_{\rm s} \tag{1}$$

 $C_{\rm s}$  is the specific capacitance and reported to be between 0.022 to 0.130 mF cm<sup>-2</sup> in alkaline solution. In this study, we use the value of  $C_s$  to be 0.040 mF cm<sup>-2</sup> based on previously reported Ni-based OER catalysts.<sup>29</sup>

The turnover frequency (TOF) value is calculated according to the following equation:

$$TOF = (J \times A)/(4 \times F \times n) \tag{2}$$

in which J is the current density at a given overpotential of 300 mV, A is the surface area of the electrode (0.196 cm<sup>2</sup>), the number 4 represents 4 electrons per mol of O2, F is the Faraday constant (96 485.3 C  $\text{mol}^{-1}$ ), and n is the number of moles of metal ions in the prepared samples. In this work, all metal ions in (Ni,Fe)<sub>3</sub>Se<sub>4</sub> and Ni<sub>3</sub>Se<sub>4</sub> nanosheets were assumed to be catalytically active no matter whether they are accessible to the electrolyte or not. So, the calculated TOF value represents the lower limit. <sup>39,40</sup> At  $\eta = 300$  mV, the (Ni,Fe)<sub>3</sub>Se<sub>4</sub> electrode generates a high current density of 70.4 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> (compared to 7.6 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> by the Ni<sub>3</sub>Se<sub>4</sub> electrode at the same overpotential). The TOF of (Ni,Fe)<sub>3</sub>Se<sub>4</sub> electrodes at  $\eta$  = 300 mV can be calculated as follows:

TOF = 
$$(0.0704 \text{ A cm}^{-2} \times 0.196 \text{ cm}^{2})/(4 \times 96 \text{ 485.3 C mol}^{-1} \times 0.132 \times 10^{-3} \text{ g} \div 484 \text{ g mol}^{-1} \times 3)$$
  
=  $4.4 \times 10^{-2} \text{ s}^{-1}$ 

# Results and discussion

A two-step procedure was used to synthesize (Ni,Fe)3Se4 ultrathin nanosheets. First, a NiFe based layered double hydroxide nanosheet precursor was hydrothermally prepared according to a previously reported method, 32 followed by converting NiFe LDH nanosheets into (Ni,Fe)<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>4</sub> nanosheets with a similar morphology by a topotactic conversion reaction (see the Experimental section for details). To investigate the composition and crystallinity of the NiFe LDH precursor and selenized samples, we first employed X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. The XRD pattern of the LDH precursor is shown in Fig. S1.† The diffraction peaks of the LDH precursor are ascribed to the standard hexagonal α-Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> (JCPDS 38-0715) and β-Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> (JCPDS 14-0117). As shown in Fig. 1a, the XRD pattern of the Ni<sub>3</sub>Se<sub>4</sub> nanosheets could be readily indexed to the monoclinic phase of Ni<sub>3</sub>Se<sub>4</sub> (JCPDS no. 18-890, I2/m space group). No crystalline impurity was detected. The unit cell of monoclinic metal selenide is shown in Fig. 1b. The diffraction

peaks of the  $(Ni,Fe)_3Se_4$  nanosheets were shifted to higher angles compared with their counterparts in the  $Ni_3Se_4$  sample, which is due to the substitution of Fe for  $Ni.^{32}$  The XRD results confirm the successful conversion of NiFe LDH to  $(Ni,Fe)_3Se_4$ . Inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) analysis revealed that the Ni/Fe/Se ratio of the product is very close to 10:1:15.

The morphologies of the as-prepared samples were first characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). As shown in Fig. 2, all prepared samples displayed a hierarchical microstructure, with a nanosheet-assembled flower-like morphology. At the microscale, Ni<sub>3</sub>Se<sub>4</sub> and (Ni<sub>5</sub>Fe)<sub>3</sub>Se<sub>4</sub> inherited the morphology of Ni- and NiFe-based nanosheet precursors (Fig. 2a-h). In contrast to the smooth surfaces of the Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> and NiFe LDH nanosheet precursor (Fig. 2a-d), the Ni<sub>3</sub>Se<sub>4</sub> and (Ni,Fe)3Se4 nanosheets are porous with rough surfaces (Fig. 2e-h). The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image further revealed the hierarchical nanosheet morphology of Ni<sub>3</sub>Se<sub>4</sub> and (Ni<sub>5</sub>Fe)<sub>3</sub>Se<sub>4</sub> (Fig. 3a and c and Fig. S2†). Fig. 3b depicts the high resolution TEM (HRTEM) image of a Ni<sub>3</sub>Se<sub>4</sub> nansheet, in which the clear lattice fringe of 0.27 nm corresponds to the (-112) plane of Ni<sub>3</sub>Se<sub>4</sub>. The HRTEM image of (Ni,Fe)<sub>3</sub>Se<sub>4</sub> in Fig. 3d shows the lattice fringes of the (-112) plane, which corresponds to d = 0.26 nm, slightly smaller than that of Ni<sub>3</sub>Se<sub>4</sub> due to the substitution of Fe for Ni. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns (inset of Fig. 3b and d) also verify the structure of Ni<sub>3</sub>Se<sub>4</sub> and (Ni<sub>4</sub>Fe)<sub>3</sub>Se<sub>4</sub> samples. As illustrated in Fig. 3e-h, the high-angle annular dark-field scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM) elemental mapping figures obtained during the TEM measurements confirm an atomically uniform distribution of Ni, Fe, and Se elements in the ultrathin (Ni,Fe)<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>4</sub> nanosheets. The corresponding energy dispersive X-ray analysis (Fig. S3†) obtained from the selected square in the image as displayed in Fig. 3c further verified the existence of Ni, Fe, and Se and revealed an Fe/Ni atomic ratio of  $\sim 1/10$ , consistent with the ICP result. The thickness of (Ni,Fe)<sub>3</sub>Se<sub>4</sub> nanosheets measured by atomic force microscopy (AFM) was about 2.5 nm (Fig. 3i-k), in good accord with the TEM findings. The AFM image also shows that the prepared selenide nanosheets exhibit a layered structure with a lateral size of several hundred nanometers.

The specific surface area and the porous structure of the prepared hierarchical porous (Ni,Fe) $_3$ Se $_4$  ultrathin nanosheets were characterized using the nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms. The isotherm (Fig. S4 $\dagger$ ) shows the porous features, in line with the SEM results. The determined Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area of the porous (Ni,Fe) $_3$ Se $_4$  ultrathin nanosheet catalyst is calculated as 75 m $^2$  g $^{-1}$ . The large specific surface area and porous structure possibly supply more exposed active sites and accessible channels for electrocatalysis. $^{41}$ 

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed to further obtain the elemental bonding configuration and surface chemical composition of (Ni,Fe) $_3$ Se $_4$ . As shown in Fig. 4, the spectrum of Ni 2p (Fig. 4a) consists of two pairs of spin–orbit doublets arising from  $2p_{3/2}$  and  $2p_{1/2}$  signals and two shakeup satellites. The peak at 853.3 eV in the Ni  $2p_{3/2}$  spectra has a binding energy between nickel metal (852.6 eV) and nickel oxides (853.7–855.9 eV). These binding energies indicate the presence of metal selenides. In the Fe 2p XPS spectrum (Fig. 4b), the binding energy peaks at 706.3 and

Fig. 4 XPS spectra of the (a) Ni 2p, (b) Fe 2p, and (c) Se 3d peaks of  $(Ni,Fe)_3Se_4$  nanosheets.

712.7 eV are attributed to  $Fe^{2+}$   $2p_{3/2}$  and  $Fe^{3+}$   $2p_{3/2}$  signals, <sup>28</sup> respectively. In addition, the peak fitting of Se 3d shows that the peak at 55.2 eV corresponds to Se  $3d_{5/2}$  (Fig. 4c). The peak at 59.5 eV is attributed to Se-O bonding structures which confirm the surface oxidation of Se species (SeO<sub>2</sub>).<sup>25</sup>

For the electrochemical characterization in 1 M KOH solution, a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) and a graphite rod counter electrode were used as reference and counter electrodes, respectively. The OER catalytic performance of (Ni,Fe)<sub>3</sub>Se<sub>4</sub> was first evaluated by typical polarization curves. As shown in Fig. 5a, the (Ni,Fe)<sub>3</sub>Se<sub>4</sub> nanosheet supported on Ni foam affords a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> at a low overpotential of 225 mV, which is lower than that of recently reported nonprecious metal based electrodes such as amorphous Fe-NiSe nanowires (233 mV), 35 NiFe-Se/C composite nanorods (240 mV),<sup>34</sup> (Ni,Co)<sub>0.85</sub>Se nanotube arrays (255 mV),<sup>33</sup> NiFe<sub>3</sub>N nanoparticles (280 mV), 15 amorphous CoFe-H nanosheets (280 mV), 41 graphene supported Co-Bi nanosheets (290 mV), 42 nickel foam supported Ni<sub>3</sub>Se<sub>2</sub> (315 mV), 43 Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>@Co<sub>9</sub>S<sub>8</sub>/rGO (320 mV), 44 and Mn-Co oxyphosphide particles (370 mV). 45 As observed in Fig. 5b, when (Ni,Fe)<sub>3</sub>Se<sub>4</sub> is loaded on GC, it exhibits a significantly larger current density than the commercial IrO<sub>2</sub> and Ni<sub>3</sub>Se<sub>4</sub>. The (Ni,Fe)<sub>3</sub>Se<sub>4</sub>, commercial IrO<sub>2</sub> and Ni<sub>3</sub>Se<sub>4</sub> required overpotentials of 250, 280 and 320 mV (Fig. 5c), respectively to achieve the current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. It is shown that a catalyst often shows a much smaller overpotential when measured with a Ni foam than a glassy carbon electrode, which is consistent with the previous literature. 44,46 Moreover, at  $\eta = 300$  mV, (Ni,Fe)<sub>3</sub>Se<sub>4</sub> nanosheets showed a turnover frequency (TOF) value of 0.044 s<sup>-1</sup>, and an OER mass activity of 109 mA mg<sup>-1</sup> (Fig. 5d and e), respectively. The former is 9.4 times that of Ni<sub>3</sub>Se<sub>4</sub>, and 2.6 times that of IrO<sub>2</sub>, while the latter is 9.2 times that of Ni<sub>3</sub>Se<sub>4</sub>, and 3.7 times that of commercial IrO2, respectively. We believe that the high OER activity results from the rich active sites of ultrathin nanosheets as well as the synergetic effects of the bi-transition metals.<sup>28</sup>

Fig. 6 Tafel plots of Ni<sub>3</sub>Se<sub>4</sub>, (Ni,Fe)<sub>3</sub>Se<sub>4</sub> nanosheets and IrO<sub>2</sub> derived from the OER voltammograms.

The corresponding Tafel slopes were determined to evaluate the OER kinetics. As shown in Fig. 6, the measured Tafel slope for IrO<sub>2</sub> is about 71 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>, close to the reported values. 47 The Tafel slope of Ni<sub>3</sub>Se<sub>4</sub> is around 140 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>, which is further decreased to 41 mV dec<sup>-1</sup> for (Ni,Fe)<sub>3</sub>Se<sub>4</sub>. As far as we know, this value is comparable to or even smaller than that of many NiFe-LDH based OER catalysts. 48 A smaller Tafel slope indicates more effective kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction, as the enhancement of current densities is more rapid with the increase of overpotentials. The fast electrode kinetics of (Ni,Fe)<sub>3</sub>Se<sub>4</sub> is made more evident by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Fig. 7a shows the Nyquist plots of (Ni,Fe)<sub>3</sub>Se<sub>4</sub> and Ni<sub>3</sub>Se<sub>4</sub> nanosheets at the overpotential of 270 mV. The EIS data demonstrate a much smaller charge transfer resistance of the (Ni,Fe)3Se4 electrode than that of Ni<sub>3</sub>Se<sub>4</sub>, indicating much faster electron transfer and thus better OER electrocatalytic performance. This is benefitted from the higher electrical conductivity and the unique hierarchical porous ultrathin nanosheet architecture, which are in favor of charge and mass transport, and a fast diffusion and reaction at the electrolyte-electrode interface. 9,49 The electrochemically active surface areas (ECSAs) of (Ni,Fe)3Se4 and Ni<sub>3</sub>Se<sub>4</sub> were estimated from the electrochemical double layer capacitance  $(C_{dl})$ . From Fig. 7b, it is clear that the  $C_{dl}$  of (Ni,Fe)<sub>3</sub>Se<sub>4</sub> at 5.94 mF cm<sup>-2</sup> is about two times higher than that of Ni<sub>3</sub>Se<sub>4</sub> (2.74 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>). The value of ECSA of (Ni,Fe)<sub>3</sub>Se<sub>4</sub>

(148.5 cm<sup>2</sup>) was much larger than Ni<sub>3</sub>Se<sub>4</sub> nanosheets

(68.5 cm<sup>2</sup>), suggesting that (Ni,Fe)<sub>3</sub>Se<sub>4</sub> nanosheets had more exposed catalytically active sites during the OER.

Besides the mass activity, specific activity is also another key indicator to evaluate the performance of electrocatalysts.<sup>39</sup> Consequently, we also calculated the mass and specific activities of different potentials with respect to the catalyst's loading mass and the estimated ECSA, respectively. (Ni,Fe)<sub>3</sub>Se<sub>4</sub> was found to outperform Ni<sub>3</sub>Se<sub>4</sub> in terms of both mass and specific activities (Fig. 5e and Fig. S6†). The obtained high mass and specific activities of (Ni,Fe)<sub>3</sub>Se<sub>4</sub> indicate that (Ni,Fe)<sub>3</sub>Se<sub>4</sub> may have an intrinsic OER activity higher than Ni<sub>3</sub>Se<sub>4</sub>. This result suggests that the introduction of iron may change the electronic structure of Ni<sub>3</sub>Se<sub>4</sub> and obtain felicitous electronic environments that enhance the OER catalytic activity.<sup>28</sup> To clarify the molecular and electronic origin of the OER activity difference between (Ni,Fe)<sub>3</sub>Se<sub>4</sub> and Ni<sub>3</sub>Se<sub>4</sub>, further theoretical investigation may be needed.

The durability of electrocatalysts is a crucial criterion to consider for practical applications. Hence, the long-term stability of (Ni,Fe)<sub>3</sub>Se<sub>4</sub> during the electrocatalysis of OER was evaluated with chronopotentiometry at a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. As shown in Fig. 8, upon application of the anodic current, the potential fleetly increases to 1.49 V within 1 min and only goes up to 1.51 V after 26 h long continuous operation. Additionally, the polarization curve of the electrocatalyst after 26 h remained very similar to the original one with merely little deterioration (inset of Fig. 8), exhibiting excellent electrocatalytic stability for the OER.

In order to verify the composition of the material at the electrode surface after OER measurements, we further conducted a XPS and TEM investigation on (Ni,Fe)3Se4 nanosheets. As shown in Fig. S7a,† the Ni 2p3/2 peak was shifted from 853.5 eV to 855.7 eV, indicating the formation of NiFeO<sub>x</sub>. 25 The intensity of the Se 3d peak reduced, and the intensity of O 1s peak was very strong (Fig. S7b and c†). The main peak at 530.5 eV of the O 1s spectrum can be attributed to Ni-OH or Fe-OH. 25,50 The HAADF-STEM image (Fig. S8a†)

showed that the material after electrolysis retained their original morphology. Elemental mapping was also used to examine the change of composition after OER measurements. The analysis revealed that Ni, Fe and Se remained uniformly distributed, while oxygen was incorporated (Fig. S8b-e†). The HRTEM image (Fig. S9†) showed lattice fringes of the material after electrolysis, which were different from the original (Ni, Fe)<sub>3</sub>Se<sub>4</sub> nanosheets. The inter-planar distance of 0.24 nm was indexed to the (101) planes of metal hydroxides (for example, LDH or Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>).<sup>25,51</sup> Considering all of the above results, the (Ni,Fe)<sub>3</sub>Se<sub>4</sub> nanosheets were partially oxidized during the OER, forming highly active Ni-Fe oxide/hydroxide species on the surface. This is similar to other metal doped Ni-based sulfide and phosphide OER electrocatalysts in previous studies. 52,53 Ni-Fe oxide/hydroxide species are thought to be the active catalytic sites for the OER process. 25,52,53 Meanwhile, (Ni, Fe)<sub>3</sub>Se<sub>4</sub> is responsible for maintaining the electronic conductivity between the electrode and active hydroxide layer and thus provides fast charge transport.54

Besides its electrocatalytic property for OER in alkaline media, the electrocatalytic performance of (Ni,Fe)<sub>3</sub>Se<sub>4</sub> for HER in basic solutions was also investigated. This was carried out in 1 M KOH solution, again using a three-electrode cell. (Ni,Fe)<sub>3</sub>Se<sub>4</sub> was found to require an overpotential of 173 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> (Fig. S10†). Given the bifunctional catalytic activities of the (Ni,Fe)<sub>3</sub>Se<sub>4</sub> electrode for OER and HER, an electrolyzer was constructed for overall water splitting in 1.0 M KOH solution using (Ni,Fe)<sub>3</sub>Se<sub>4</sub> as both the anode and cathode. For comparison, a control electrolyzer comprising pure Ni<sub>3</sub>Se<sub>4</sub> and bare nickel foams (NF) were also fabricated. Fig. 9a shows the polarization curves of (Ni,Fe)<sub>3</sub>Se<sub>4</sub>/ NF, Ni<sub>3</sub>Se<sub>4</sub>/NF and bare NF electrolyzers measured in a twoelectrode configuration. The (Ni,Fe)<sub>3</sub>Se<sub>4</sub> electrolyzer only needs a cell voltage of 1.60 V to afford a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. On the other hand, voltages of 1.74 V and 1.90 V are required for the Ni<sub>3</sub>Se<sub>4</sub> and bare NF, respectively, to achieve the same current density. Moreover, the voltage of the (Ni, Fe)<sub>3</sub>Se<sub>4</sub> electrolyzer is close to that of the commercial catalysts (Pt/C and IrO2) modified Ni foam with the same loading

(b) Long-term catalytic stability chronopotentiometric test of the (Ni,  $Fe)_3Se_4$  nanosheet electrolyzer at 20 mA cm $^{-2}$ . Inset shows the multistep chronopotentiometric curve of the (Ni,Fe)<sub>3</sub>Se<sub>4</sub>/CF electrolyzer at varying current densities. All experiments were conducted in 1.0 M KOH at room

(Fig. S11†) and those of Ni-based materials. 11,26,43 After 155 h of electrolysis, the electrolyzer still exhibited high activity for overall water splitting, indicating its high stability in electrochemical processes over long time periods (Fig. 9b). Furthermore, the capability of the (Ni,Fe)<sub>3</sub>Se<sub>4</sub> electrolyzer operating at different current densities was investigated (inset of Fig. 9b). The steady-state cell voltages of the (Ni,Fe)<sub>3</sub>Se<sub>4</sub> electrolyzer are 1.60, 1.73, 1.85, 2.00, and 2.08 V, respectively, for delivering 10, 20, 40, 80, and 100 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>.

Based on the experiments and structural analysis, the exciting catalytic activity and stability of the (Ni,Fe)3Se4 ultrathin nanosheets can be mainly attributed to several aspects. First, the ultrathin nanosheets have rich and accessible catalytically active sites. Second, (Ni,Fe)<sub>3</sub>Se<sub>4</sub> nanosheets own a high specific surface area and a felicitous electronic environment of the bitransition metal system that enhance the OER catalytic performance. Third, the mixed transition metal and the porous ultrathin nanosheet structure hasten charge transfer and cause a fast diffusion and reaction at the electrolyte-electrode interface.

# Conclusion

In summary, we show that hierarchical (Ni,Fe)<sub>3</sub>Se<sub>4</sub> ultrathin nanosheets are ideal OER electrocatalysts in alkaline solutions, exhibiting a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> at a low overpotential of 225 mV, a small Tafel slope of 41 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>, and longterm stability. What is more, the hierarchical (Ni,Fe)<sub>3</sub>Se<sub>4</sub> ultrathin nanosheets showed a promising bifunctional OER/HER catalytic ability for overall water splitting. The overall-watersplitting with 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> at a low voltage of 1.60 V was achieved using the (Ni,Fe)3Se4 electrode as both anode and cathode. The excellent activity is due to the accessible catalytically active sites, the high specific surface area, and the improved charge transfer. To our knowledge, this is the first study on Ni<sub>3</sub>Se<sub>4</sub> based bi-transition metal materials with an ultrathin nanosheet morphology as an OER catalyst, exhibiting a remarkable electrocatalytic activity and opening up a promising route to achieve highly efficient and long-term stability electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution.

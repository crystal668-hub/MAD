**The urea oxidation reaction (UOR) is a promising approach for replacing the oxygen evolution reaction in hydrogen production, offering lower energy consumption. However, the kinetics of Ni-based catalysts for UOR are hindered by the high formation potential of NiOOH and its repeated transition with Ni(OH)2. In this study, a local microenvironment featuring electron-deficient N-vacancies (VN) paired with adjacent electron-rich Ni-sites on Ni3N (Ni3N-VN) to enhance UOR kinetics is constructed. The electron-rich Ni-sites significantly reduce the energy barrier for NiOOH formation and promote the conversion of Ni(OH)2 to NiOOH. Meanwhile, the VN sites induce low charge transfer resistance in Ni3N, facilitating efficient electron transfer and boosting UOR performance while ensuring the stability of the active NiOOH phase. The VN sites promote the adsorption of the urea N atom at the active site, favoring the reaction pathway toward "NCO<sup>−</sup>" formation without requiring complete urea dissociation. This pathway alleviates the NiOOH/Ni(OH)2 conversion cycle, lowers charge transfer resistance, and improves reaction kinetics. Ni3N-VN demonstrates excellent UOR activity (low potential of 1.46 V at 1000 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2) and industrial prospects (integrating into an anion exchange membrane flow electrolyzer with 20% Pt/C, producing 600 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> at 1.84 V), highlighting its potential for practical applications.**

## **1. Introduction**

The paradox of increasing energy demand and decreasing fossil fuel urges humankind to search for technologies to develop sustainable and clean energy sources.[\[1\]](#page-9-0) The use of water electrolysis to obtain green hydrogen has been considered the most promising hydrogen energy technology.[\[2\]](#page-9-0) However, the anode half-reaction (oxygen evolution reaction, OER) of water splitting suffers from the intrinsically sluggish kinetics and a large thermodynamic potential of 1.23 V.[\[3\]](#page-9-0) These problems result in the high energy consumption of hydrogen production from water electrolysis. Using the thermodynamically advantageous urea oxidation reaction (UOR) with a small theoretical barrier (only 0.37 V) to replace the OER offers a promising strategy to reduce the energy consumption of hydrogen production from water electrolysis.[\[4,5\]](#page-9-0) Hence, it is of urgent significance to pursue efficient UOR catalysts.

Nickel (Ni)-based materials such as nickel oxide,[\[6\]](#page-9-0) nickel hydroxide,[\[7\]](#page-9-0) nickel sulfide,[\[8\]](#page-9-0) nickel phosphide,[\[9\]](#page-9-0) and nickel nitride,[\[10\]](#page-9-0) etc. are identified as excellent UOR catalysts due to their ability to dissociate C─N bonds of urea. In most cases, the basic principle of Ni-based catalysts for UOR is believed to the indirect oxidation mechanism proposed by Botte et al. in 2013,[\[11\]](#page-9-0) the mechanism mentioned above can be represented as follows:

$$6\text{Ni(OH)}_2 + 6\text{OH}^- \rightarrow 6\text{NiOOH} + 6\text{H}_2\text{O} + 6\text{e}^-$$
 (1)

$$6\text{NiOOH} + \text{CO}(\text{NH}_2)_2 + \text{H}_2\text{O} \rightarrow 6\text{Ni}(\text{OH})_2 + \text{N}_2 + \text{CO}_2$$
 (2)

In this reaction pathway, the surface of Ni-based catalyst is oxidized to Ni<sup>3</sup><sup>+</sup> state (NiOOH), which serves as the active catalysis site for UOR. Then the urea is adsorbed on NiOOH through C or O atom and transforms into CO2 and N2 with 6e<sup>−</sup> transfer, along with the reduction of NiOOH back to Ni(OH)2. [\[12\]](#page-9-0) Actually, complete dissociation of urea to CO2 and N2 is not ideal for boosting UOR kinetics, since the electron transfer of UOR depends on the conversion of Ni(OH)2 to NiOOH back and forth. The 6e<sup>−</sup> conversions of Ni(OH)2/NiOOH in UOR require to overcome a high energy barrier, leading to a large charge transfer resistance (Rct), which impacts the reaction rate and overpotential by influencing the reaction kinetics.[\[13–15\]](#page-9-0) Therefore, the kinetics of UOR is significantly determined by the generation and regeneration of NiOOH species, particularly the regeneration process. Conversely, partial dissociation of urea such as NCO<sup>−</sup>, does not require as many electrons to participate in the reaction as complete dissociation species do.[\[16\]](#page-9-0) This greatly alleviates the reduction of NiOOH and thus leads to a lower Rct and fast kinetics.

The establishment of urea adsorption configurations plays a key role in the control of UOR intermediate products, that is, the number of electron transfers. For instance, in most cases, the adsorption of C/O atom requires the transfer of 6e<sup>−</sup> for one Ni-site (complete dissociation: formation of CO2 and N2). However, the adsorption of N atom of urea is beneficial for partial dissociation: the generation of NCO<sup>−</sup> and \*NH with 1e<sup>−</sup> transfer, while the oxidation of \*NH at the active site to the final product NO2 <sup>−</sup> also requires only 4e<sup>−</sup> transfer.[\[16–18\]](#page-9-0) This means that the N adsorption configuration is more conducive to reducing electron transfer, thereby reducing the reduction of NiOOH, which in turn lowers the impact of high Rct caused by NiOOH reduction on the kinetics. According to the principles of thermodynamic adsorption, surface electron-deficient region of the catalyst tends to adsorb the electron-donating group (-NH2) of urea, making the N atom of urea readily bind to the active sites to optimize UOR reaction pathway.[\[5,18,19\]](#page-9-0) Additionally, the initial generation of active NiOOH is seriously affected by the coordination environment of Ni-sites,[[20,21\]](#page-9-0) the Ni-sites with lower oxidation state have a relatively large number of electrons in the d orbital, and these electrons are relatively easy to lose, which makes it easier for the Ni sites to oxidize to high oxidation state NiOOH.[\[21,22\]](#page-9-0) Therefore, an ideal Ni-based UOR electrocatalyst should have both electrondeficient regions and electron-rich Ni sites to favor the generation and regeneration of active NiOOH species.

Herein, we introduced nitrogen-vacancy (VN) into Ni3N grown on nickel foam (without or with VN are denoted as Ni3N/NF and Ni3N-VN/NF, respectively) to modulate the local microenvironment of VN and adjacent Ni-site. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and experimental characterization proved that the electron-rich state of Ni sites lowers the energy barrier for their transition to NiOOH and reduces the formation potential of NiOOH. At the same time, VN enables Ni3N-VN/NF to have a small charge transfer impedance, ensuring the charge transfer for boosting UOR, while ensuring the stability of active NiOOH. Moreover, the electron-deficient VN enhances the adsorption of an N atom of urea on the catalyst, which was conducive to the occurrence of incomplete urea dissociation into NCO<sup>−</sup>, alleviates the reduction of NiOOH, and thus reduces the charge transfer resistance, and enables Ni3N-VN/NF exhibits faster reaction kinetics and superior UOR performance. The optimal Ni3N-VN/NF shows exceptional UOR activity (a potential of just 1.46 V at a current density of 1000 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2), significantly lower than that of Ni3N/NF (1.60 V). The anion exchange membrane (AEM) flow electrolyzer combined with Ni3N-VN/NF(M) anode and 20% commercial Pt/C cathode required only 1.84 V to achieve 600 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2.

# **2. Result and Discussion**

#### **2.1. Prediction of UOR Mechanism via DFT Calculations**

To predict the effect of the local microenvironment of VN and adjacent Ni sites with the introduction of VN on the UOR, DFT calculations were performed. Firstly, Models of Ni3N with and without VN (Ni3N-VN and Ni3N) were constructed (Figure S1, Supporting Information) for study the change of the electronic state of Ni3N after introducing VN. Since VN is formed by the loss of N atoms from Ni3N, it is widely distributed on the catalyst surface and all VN sites are identical, the Ni3N-VN model is constructed by randomly replacing N atoms in Ni3N with VN. Charge density calculations show that VN changes the electronic state of the Ni3N-VN, creating the local microenvironment of VN and adjacent Ni sites (**Figure 1**[a\)](#page-2-0). The Bader charge analysis (Figure [1b\)](#page-2-0) reveals the electron transfer propensity, the average charge of Ni atoms near the VN in Ni3N-VN is−0.1387 |e|, which is much lower than the average charge of Ni atoms in the same positions in Ni3N (−0.3979 |e|). This indicates that the Ni atoms near VN in Ni3N-VN are electron-rich compared to those in Ni3N. This further confirms that introducing VN causes electron delocalization at the vacancy center to form an electron-deficient regions. Concurrently, it reduces the electron removal from Ni atoms near VN, creating electron-rich regions at the Ni sites. Second, the adsorption of urea molecules on Ni3N-VN (or Ni3N-VN/NiOOH) and Ni3N (or Ni3N/NiOOH) was discussed. The adsorption of N atom on the catalyst is stronger than that of C/O atom, suggesting that urea tends to be adsorbed on the catalyst by N atom. The slightly stronger adsorption of urea molecules on Ni3N-VN (or Ni3N-VN/NiOOH) compared to Ni3N (or Ni3N/NiOOH) indicates that electron-deficient VN optimize urea adsorption (Figures S2 and S3, Supporting Information; and Figure [1c\)](#page-2-0). Thirdly, the process of Ni sites transforming into NiOOH was discussed. Gibbs free energy calculations revealed that compared to Ni3N (4.34 eV), Ni3N-VN (3.30 eV) has a lower energy barrier for NiOOH generation (Figure [1d\)](#page-2-0).

The partial density of states (PDOS) analysis showed that compared to Ni3N, the d-band center of Ni sites in Ni3N-VN is closer to the Fermi level, facilitating easier electron excitation to higher

energy states favorable for NiOOH formation (Figure 1e).[13,23] This suggests that the introduction of V<sub>N</sub> optimizes the local electron distribution, generates electron-rich Ni sites, and promotes the transformation of Ni sites to NiOOH. In addition, after the generation of NiOOH on Ni<sub>3</sub>N-V<sub>N</sub>, the local microenvironment of V<sub>N</sub> and adjacent Ni sites remained in the original state (Figure S4, Supporting Information; and Figure 1f), which was conducive to the stability of UOR. Fourthly, the advantages of Ni<sub>3</sub>N-V<sub>N</sub> for the "NCO" pathway were explored. By comparing the differential charges of Ni<sub>3</sub>N-V<sub>N</sub>/NiOOH and Ni<sub>3</sub>N/NiOOH adsorbent urea, Differential charge diagrams clearly demonstrate significant electron exchange around the C-N bond of urea adsorbed on Ni<sub>3</sub>N-V<sub>N</sub>/NiOOH (Figure S5, Supporting Information; and Figure 1g). Bader charge analysis (Figure S6, Supporting Information) provides more intuitive evidence: the charge on

the N atom of the C-N bond adsorbed on Ni<sub>3</sub>N-V<sub>N</sub>/NiOOH (1.14 |e|) is higher than that on Ni<sub>3</sub>N/NiOOH (1.07 |e|). The increased electronegativity disrupts the original charge transfer balance, facilitating C-N bond dissociation. The lower dissociation potential (1.73 eV) of the C-N bond on Ni<sub>3</sub>N-V<sub>N</sub> is also much lower than that of Ni<sub>3</sub>N (2.28 eV) (Figure 1d). This confirms the predominated "NCO" pathway occurs on the Ni<sub>3</sub>N-V<sub>N</sub> catalysts. Finally, the stability of NCO⁻ in the system is analyzed. By comparing the dissociation energies of the C=N bond in NCO<sup>-</sup> adsorbed on the catalyst (2.68 eV) with the C-N bond in urea adsorbed on the catalyst (1.73 eV), it was found that breaking the C=N bond requires a higher barrier than breaking the C-N bond (Figure S7, Supporting Information). Therefore, in the presence of urea, it is difficult for NCO- to further oxidize at the active site, which ensures the stability of NCO- in

#### 2.2. Synthesis and Characterization of Ni<sub>3</sub>N/NF and Ni<sub>3</sub>N-V<sub>N</sub>/NF

Based on the above forecast, the  $Ni_3N-V_N/NF$  catalyst was prepared, and the synthesis process was shown in **Figure 2a**. First,  $Ni(NO_3)_2 \cdot 6H_2O$ , urea, and  $NH_4F$  were dissolved in water and placed together with nickel foam in an autoclave at 120 °C for 6 h to obtain the  $Ni(OH)_2$  precursor grown on nickel foam  $(Ni(OH)_2/NF)$ . Subsequently,  $Ni(OH)_2/NF$  was annealed in am-

monia atmosphere at 380 °C to obtain Ni $_3$ N/NF. And then, NaBH $_4$  was used as a reducing agent to reduce Ni $_3$ N. During the reaction, the H $^-$  ions generated by the NaBH $_4$  solution attack the Ni—N bonds, resulting in the removal of some N atoms from the lattice and introducing V $_N$  into Ni $_3$ N. By controlling the reduction time, Ni $_3$ N-V $_N$ /NF with low, medium, and high V $_N$  density (Ni $_3$ N-V $_N$ /NF(L), Ni $_3$ N-V $_N$ /NF(M), and Ni $_3$ N-V $_N$ /NF(H)) were obtained. The lower V $_N$  density would not enhance the electrochemical performance sufficiently, and the too high V $_N$  density would lead to vacancy aggregation, resulting in structural instability and affect the electron distribution and migration ability. Only when the V $_N$  density is moderate, the number of

active sites and the stability of the catalyst reach a balance point, thus showing the best catalytic performance.<sup>[24]</sup> The crystal structures of the catalysts were performed by X-ray diffraction (XRD). For all catalysts (Figure 2b; Figure S8, Supporting Information), the peaks at 38.9°, 42.1°, 44.5°, 58.5°, and 70.6° belong to the (110), (002), (111), (112), and (300) planes of Ni<sub>3</sub>N (JCPDS No. 10–0280),[25-29] confirming that  $V_N$  does not affect the crystal structure of Ni<sub>3</sub>N. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image shows that the Ni<sub>3</sub>N-V<sub>N</sub>/NF(M) displays a flower-like porous structure composed of interconnected nanosheets (Figure S9d-f, Supporting Information), which inherits from the Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>/NF and Ni<sub>3</sub>N/NF samples (Figures S9a-c; S10, Supporting Information). This structure ensures a large contact area between the electrolyte and the catalyst, facilitating electrolyte penetration and gas release. The powder samples (Ni<sub>3</sub>N-V<sub>N</sub>) scraped from Ni<sub>3</sub>N-V<sub>N</sub>/NF were used for transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) characterization. The TEM and HRTEM images exhibit the lattice spacings of 0.203 and 0.214 nm of Ni<sub>3</sub>N-V<sub>N</sub> (Figure S11, Supporting Information; and Figure 2c), corresponding to (111) and (002) planes of Ni<sub>3</sub>N (JCPDS NO. 10-0280). [26,29,30] The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern exhibits a poly-crystalline structure of  $Ni_3N-V_N$ , with (112), (111), (002), and (110) planes (Figure S12, Supporting Information). High-angle annular dark field scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM) and energy dispersive X-ray elemental mapping unravel the uniform distribution of Ni and N elements in Ni<sub>3</sub>N-V<sub>N</sub> (Figure 2d). Figure 2e,f show the filtered image of orange square in Figure 2c and the normalized intensity variations of the tagged columns. In the normalized intensity images, the intensity distribution is proportional to the atomic weights passing through the corresponding atomic column along the beam distribution direction. The varied diffracted intensity clearly indicates the change in the atomic column distribution in Ni<sub>3</sub>N-V<sub>N</sub> (Figure 2e,f), possibly due to  $V_{\scriptscriptstyle N}.^{[31]}$ 

The electronic states of V<sub>N</sub> and adjacent Ni sites in Ni<sub>3</sub>N-V<sub>N</sub> were studied. The V<sub>N</sub> of Ni<sub>3</sub>N-V<sub>N</sub>/NF was characterized by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). Compared with Ni<sub>3</sub>N/NF, Ni<sub>3</sub>N-V<sub>N</sub>/NF has a distinct EPR signal (g value 2.004), and the signal strength increases with the increase of the reduction time (Figure S13, Supporting Information; and Figure 3a), indicating that V<sub>N</sub> is successfully introduced into Ni<sub>3</sub>N-V<sub>N</sub>/NF. The surface charge states of catalysts were investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Figure S14, Supporting Information). The high-resolution XPS spectrum of N 1s shows peaks for Ni–N bond and  $V_N$ . [27,32] The surface  $V_N$  concentrations (based peak area ratio of XPS) of Ni<sub>3</sub>N/NF, Ni<sub>3</sub>N-V<sub>N</sub>/NF(L), Ni<sub>3</sub>N-V<sub>N</sub>/NF(M), and Ni<sub>3</sub>N-V<sub>N</sub>/NF(H) are 1.8% (due to the reducibility of NH<sub>3</sub>), 29.7%, 42.5%, and 62.6%, respectively, which also supports the EPR results (Figure 3b; and Figure S14b,c, Supporting Information).[32] For the Ni 2p high-resolution XPS spectra of Ni<sub>3</sub>N/NF, peaks at 852.6 and 870.1 eV correspond to Ni<sup>0</sup> from the nickel foam, while peaks at 855.2 and 873.4 eV correspond to  $2p_{3/2}$  and  $2p_{1/2}$  of Ni<sup>2+</sup> (Figure 3c). [28,29] The Ni 2p signal of Ni<sub>3</sub>N- $V_N/NF(M)$  is reduced by  $\approx 0.27$  eV compared with Ni<sub>3</sub>N/NF, indicating that Ni in Ni<sub>3</sub>N-V<sub>N</sub>/NF(M) is electron-rich relative to Ni in Ni<sub>3</sub>N/NF. [28,30] The electronic states of Ni<sub>3</sub>N-V<sub>N</sub>/NF was further studied using X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectroscopy. X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) analyses

of Ni<sub>3</sub>N and Ni<sub>3</sub>N-V<sub>N</sub>(M) are compared with control samples of Ni foil and NiO (Figure 3d). To avoid the influence of NF, the powder samples (Ni<sub>3</sub>N and Ni<sub>3</sub>N-V<sub>N</sub>(M)) were synthesized and characterized by the same method. The XANES shows that the Ni K-edge absorption energies of Ni<sub>3</sub>N and Ni<sub>3</sub>N-V<sub>N</sub>(M) are between those of Ni foil and NiO, suggesting the average valence state of Ni atoms in Ni<sub>3</sub>N and Ni<sub>3</sub>N-V<sub>N</sub>(M) is between 0 and +2. Specifically, the valence state of Ni in Ni<sub>3</sub>N-V<sub>N</sub>(M) is closer to 0, further indicating V<sub>N</sub> makes the nearby Ni appear electron-rich. The extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectrum of Ni<sub>3</sub>N exhibits peaks at 1.13 and 2.23 Å for Ni-N and Ni-Ni bonds (Figure 3e).[29,30] In Ni<sub>3</sub>N-V<sub>N</sub>(M), the Ni-N bond is located at 1.35 Å, which is 0.22 Å to the right of the Ni-N bond in Ni<sub>3</sub>N. This indicates that the introduction of  $V_N$  alters the local coordination environment, affecting the interactions between atoms. As a result, Ni atoms tend to form stronger metallic bonds with neighboring Ni atoms, leading to the shortening of Ni-Ni bonds. At the same time, the Ni-N bonds are stretched, and the electrondonating ability of Ni is weakened, which results in the formation of electron-rich Ni sites in  $Ni_3N-V_N(M)$ . The EXAFS curve fitting results further clarify the above structural transformation, and the reduction in the coordination number of Ni-N bonds also provides evidence for the successful incorporation of  $V_N$  (Figure 3f; and Table S1, Supporting Information).[33]In the wavelet transform of the EXAFS spectrum (Figure 3g-i) obtained from the K-space data (Figure S15, Supporting Information), Ni<sub>3</sub>N displays signals at 4.7 and 6.2 Å<sup>-1</sup> in the K-space for Ni-N and Ni-Ni bonds, respectively. Ni<sub>3</sub>N-V<sub>N</sub>(M) shows the Ni-N bond signal and the Ni-Ni bond signal shift to 2.1  $\mbox{Å}^{-1}$  and 6.6  $\mbox{Å}^{-1}$  in Kspace, respectively. [29] This change further confirms that  $V_N$  modulates the electronic environment in Ni atom, which is consistent with DFT calculations. In other words, by introducing  $V_N$ , the local microenvironment of V<sub>N</sub> and adjacent Ni sites is adjusted to form a pairing of electron-rich Ni sites and electron-deficient

#### 2.3. Electrocatalytic UOR Performance

The OER and UOR performance of prepared catalysts were evaluated in a three-electrode system. The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves in 1 M KOH + 0.33 M urea showed Ni<sub>3</sub>N-V<sub>N</sub>/NF(M) outperformed Ni<sub>3</sub>N-V<sub>N</sub>/NF(L), Ni<sub>3</sub>N-V<sub>N</sub>/NF(H), Ni<sub>3</sub>N/NF, nickel foam, and most reported Ni<sub>3</sub>N-based catalysts (Figure 4a; Table S2, Supporting Information). Specifically, Ni<sub>3</sub>N-V<sub>N</sub>/NF(M) achieves current densities of 20/1000 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> at low potentials of 1.33/1.46 V, outperforming  $Ni_3N/NF$  ( $E_{20/1000} = 1.34/1.60 V$ ) (Figure 4b). Notably, Ni<sub>3</sub>N/NF and Ni<sub>3</sub>N-V<sub>N</sub>/NF(M) show poor OER activity (Figure \$16a, Supporting Information). After repeated cyclic voltammetry (CV) cycles, the activity of Ni<sub>3</sub>N-V<sub>N</sub>/NF(M) shows an increasing trend, while the activity of Ni<sub>2</sub> N/NF remains relatively stable. This might be related to the in situ transformation of active sites into NiOOH, followed by the consumption and accumulation of NiOOH (Figure S16b,c, Supporting Information). Tafel slopes (Figure 4c) derived from LSV and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) (Figure 4d) were used further to investigate the UOR reaction kinetics of the catalysts. Ni<sub>3</sub>N-V<sub>N</sub>/NF(M) shows a lower Tafel slope (32.1 mV  $dec^{-1}$ ) compared to Ni<sub>3</sub>N/NF (40.6 mV  $dec^{-1}$ ).

The Nyquist diagram displays a smaller semicircular radius than Ni<sub>3</sub>N/NF, indicating lower R<sub>ct</sub>. All these indicate that Ni<sub>3</sub>N-V<sub>N</sub>/NF(M) enhances the reaction kinetics due to its unique electronic structure. Additionally, double-layer capacitance (C<sub>dl</sub>) was calculated via CV to assess its intrinsic catalytic activity, which is highly correlated to the electrochemically active surface area (Figure S16d,e, Supporting Information). Ni<sub>3</sub>N-V<sub>N</sub>/NF(M) exhibits a large  $C_{\rm dl}$  value of 15.50 mF cm<sup>-2</sup> compared to Ni<sub>3</sub>N/NF (14.53 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>), indicating a larger electrochemical surface area and more exposed active sites (Figure 4e). In addition, Ni<sub>3</sub>N-V<sub>N</sub>/NF(M) maintains a current density of 100 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> at a constant voltage in UOR for 50 h and still maintains the initial 87.72%, showing good stability (Figure S17, Supporting Information). Furthermore, its industrial feasibility was tested in an AEM electrolyzer with Ni<sub>3</sub>N-V<sub>N</sub>/NF(M) anode and 20% commercial Pt/C cathode (Figure \$18, Supporting Information; and Figure 4h). The catalyst achieves a current density of 600 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> at 1.84 V with urea assistance (Figure 4f), which is better than water electrolysis without urea and exceeds the performance of other reported AEM electrolyzers for urea-coupled hydrogen production (Figure 4g; and Table S3, Supporting Information). The system operates stably for 14 h at 2 V (constant current: 1 A cm<sup>-2</sup>), demonstrating good stability (Figure 4h). As an important factor showing the economic efficiency of the electrolyzer, the price per gasoline-gallon equivalent H<sub>2</sub> is as low as \$ 0.96 according to the calculations in Supporting Information (Note S1, Supporting Information), much lower than the target of U.S. DOE by 2026 (\$ 2.00).

#### **2.4. UOR Mechanism Analysis**

To determine the roles of the the local microenvironments of VN and adjacent Ni sites in the UOR process and confirm the prediction of DFT, we performed a series of characterizations, starting with the potential-resolved in situ Raman tests were performed to reveal the true active site in the structure evolution of the Ni3N-VN/NF catalysts during UOR process. As shown in **Figure 5**[a,b,](#page-7-0) at open circuit potential (OCP) and initial potential, the Raman spectra of both catalysts show only the urea peak (1004 cm<sup>−</sup>1) due to the adsorption of urea onto the catalyst surface.[\[34,35\]](#page-9-0) When the applied potential increases to 1.35 V (vs RHE), Ni3N-VN/NF(M) firstly exhibits peaks of NiOOH (475 and 560 cm<sup>−</sup>1), which is ascribed to the reconfiguration of the surface Ni-sites into NiOOH species.[\[34–36\]](#page-9-0) Furthermore, Ni<sup>3</sup><sup>+</sup> (857.2 and 874.8 eV) appeared in the XPS spectra of Ni3N-VN/NF(M) after the reaction (Figure [5e\)](#page-7-0) also supports the formation of NiOOH.[\[29\]](#page-9-0) For Ni3N/NF, it takes a higher voltage of 1.4 V to form the NiOOH species (Figure [5b\)](#page-7-0). The time-resolved in situ Raman is also performed at 1.35 V to confirm the stability of NiOOH, which is generated by Ni3N-VN reconstruction, and Ni3N never reconstructs to NiOOH at 1.35 V (Figure S19, Supporting Information). This means that electronrich Ni sites can promote the conversion of Ni species to NiOOH species, because the lower state of Ni has a more suitable dband center to promote the formation of NiOOH.[\[13\]](#page-9-0) With the voltage returning to 1.4 V, the NiOOH peaks in Ni3N-VN/NF(M)

gradually accumulate, indicating that indirect oxidation occurred and more NiOOH is generated than consumed. However, when the voltage returns to 1.4 V, the Raman peak of NiOOH of Ni3N/NF is not significant. Apparently, the electron-deficient VN are crucial to stabilizing the formed NiOOH species. The same conclusion is also drawn from the EIS, where the EIS data of Ni3N-VN/NF(M) and Ni3N/NF were recorded at 1.3 V, 1.5 V, and back to 1.3 V to observe the changes in Rct. For Ni3N/NF, during the process from 1.3 to 1.5 V and back to 1.3 V, the Rct first decreases and then increases. For Ni3N-VN/NF(M), the Rct decreases and then remains unchanged. This is consistent with the in situ Raman results, reflecting the process where Ni3N/NF generates NiOOH during the indirect oxidation reaction, and NiOOH is subsequently consumed, while for Ni3N-VN/NF(M), NiOOH is generated and remains stable (Figure S20, Supporting Information). In situ Raman data for Ni3N-VN/NF(M) in 1 <sup>M</sup> KOH were also recorded (Figure S21, Supporting Information). In 1 <sup>M</sup> KOH, NiOOH appears at 1.4 V and cannot remain stable, demonstrating the superior performance of Ni3N-VN/NF(M) in UOR. In addition, the reconstruction of NiOOH and electron transfer of the catalysts during UOR were further studied by recording the EIS at different potentials. The Bode plots describe two electrochemical processes on the Ni3N/NF and Ni3N-VN/NF(M) electrodes (Figure 5c,d), showing the phase angle in the high-frequency region for internal resistance of the electrode, and the phase angle in the low-frequency region for electron transfer from the electrolyte to the catalytic layer. For Ni3N-VN/NF(M), the appearance of phase angle in the highfrequency region at above 1.35 V is derived from the abundant low-conductivity NiOOH, which indicates the more stability of the true NiOOH active site in Ni3N-VN than that of Ni3N.[\[37\]](#page-10-0) Simultaneously, the phase angle of Ni3N-VN/NF(M) in the low-frequency region between 1.25–1.35 V decreases faster than that of Ni3N/NF, resulting in the generation of NiOOH at low potential for Ni3N-VN, which consists with the Raman results. Moreover, the smaller phase angle in the low-frequency of Ni3N-VN compared with Ni3N indicates the fast charge transfer, which benefits the UOR kinetics.[\[37,38\]](#page-10-0) These results strongly demonstrate that the phase transition energy barrier and electron transfer barrier for Ni3N-VN/NF(M) are lower than those for Ni3N/NF, resulting in faster reaction kinetics.

microenvironments reduce the formation potential of NiOOH and guarantee fewer NiOOH/Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> conversion, thereby synergistically optimizing the UOR overpotential and kinetics of Ni<sub>3</sub>N-V<sub>N</sub>/NF(M). The stability of catalyst structure is the key to its electrochemical stability. Ni<sub>3</sub>N-V<sub>N</sub>/NF(M) was characterized after 50 h i-t test. XPS (Figure S22, Supporting Information; and Figure 5e) show the presence of Ni<sup>3+</sup>, indicating the formation of NiOOH. The main phase of the catalyst is Ni<sub>3</sub>N after the i-t test (Figure S23a, Supporting Information). In addition, the EPR (Figure S23b, Supporting Information) spectra of Ni<sub>3</sub>N-V<sub>N</sub>/NF(M) showed no significant changes, which was consistent with the conclusion of DFT, indicating the local microenvironments of V<sub>N</sub> and Ni sites remain on the Ni<sub>3</sub>N-V<sub>N</sub>/NF(M) catalyst after UOR.

Then we analyzed the UOR products and first detected the intermediates and liquid-phase products of UOR on Ni<sub>3</sub>N/NF and Ni<sub>3</sub>N-V<sub>N</sub>/NF(M). The reaction intermediates of Ni<sub>3</sub>N-V<sub>N</sub>/NF(M) at different potentials were investigated using in situ FTIR spectroscopy (Figure 5f).[15] Compared with the FTIR spectra at OCP, higher potentials show positive peaks at ca. 1630 ( $\delta$ (HNH) vibrations), 1460 ( $\nu$ (CN) vibration), and 1150 cm<sup>-1</sup> ( $\rho$ (NH<sub>2</sub>) vibration), which is assigned to urea consumption. The strongest  $\delta(HNH)$ vibration peak indicates that the urea is adsorbed on the catalyst by N atoms. As the intensity of the urea consumption peak increases, three negative-pointing absorption peaks appear at ca. 1230, 1380, 2160, and 2360 cm<sup>-1</sup>, which can be attributed to the formation of NO2-, CO32-, NCO-, and CO2, respectively. For Ni<sub>3</sub>N/NF, the intensity of the peak corresponding to NCO- is relatively weak (Figure S24, Supporting Information), indicating that the proportion of NCO- in the UOR product of Ni<sub>3</sub>N/NF is lower than that of Ni<sub>3</sub>N-V<sub>N</sub>/NF(M). Chronoamperometric tests were conducted on Ni<sub>3</sub>N/NF and Ni<sub>3</sub>N-V<sub>N</sub>/NF(M) at 1.5 and 2.0 V (vs RHE). After a significant decrease in current, the electrolytes were collected and analyzed using ion chromatography and <sup>13</sup>C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, at which point urea was almost completely consumed in both electrolytes. The data reveal that the primary UOR products of Ni<sub>3</sub>N/NF and Ni<sub>3</sub>N- $V_N/NF(M)$  are  $NO_x^-$ ,  $NCO^-$ ,  $NH_4^{+}$ , and  $CO_3^{2-}$  at both low and high voltages (Figure 5g,h; Figure S25, Supporting Information; and Table S4, Supporting Information). Considering the results obtained here and prior literature, [35,39] we proposed a combined "NCO" and "NH<sub>3</sub> + CO<sub>2</sub>" UOR reaction pathway of Ni<sub>3</sub>N-V<sub>N</sub> and Ni<sub>3</sub>N. Specifically, urea is firstly adsorbed on the surfaces of Ni<sub>3</sub>N-V<sub>N</sub> and Ni<sub>3</sub>N through the N atom of one -NH<sub>2</sub> group at the OCP. As the reaction progresses, the Ni sites on the catalyst surface gradually transform into NiOOH at higher potentials. In situ Raman spectroscopy (Figure S21, Supporting Information) confirms that NiOOH forms in 1  $_{\rm M}$  KOH even in the absence of urea. However, the presence of urea stabilizes the NiOOH phase by modulating the local microenvironment, which enhances the UOR kinetics. In the "NH<sub>3</sub> + CO<sub>2</sub>" pathway (Figure S26, Supporting Information), the C-N bond adjacent to the unadsorbed -NH<sub>2</sub> group of urea (the distal C-N bond) was first broken and converted to NH<sub>4</sub>+. Subsequently, the adsorbed C-N bond (the proximal C-N bond) dissociates to release CO2 and thus to form CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup> in solution. However, if the proximal C—N bond (adjacent to the adsorbed -NH2 group of urea) breaks first, a very different "NCO" pathway occurs (Figure 5i; Figure S27, Supporting Information). In other words, the proximal C-N bond decomposes

into NCO<sup>-</sup>, while the distal C-N bond of the NCO<sup>-</sup> species could not be further catalyzed to decompose, and the retained NCOcan be used as a precursor to produce isocyanate. In both the "NCO" and "NH<sub>3</sub> + CO<sub>2</sub>" pathways, any remaining \*NH adsorbed on the surface is further oxidized to NO<sub>v</sub> (if the adjacent binding site is unavailable for N) or undergoes N-N coupling to form N<sub>2</sub> (if the adjacent binding site is available for N). It should be noted that for the UOR process involving Ni<sub>3</sub>N/NF, the nitrogen content in NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> in the product is similar to that of NCO<sup>-</sup>, indicating that the "NCO" pathway holds an equivalent status to the "NH3+CO2" pathway. However, for the UOR process in which Ni<sub>3</sub>N-V<sub>N</sub>/NF(M) participated, the proportion of NCO<sup>-</sup> increases significantly compared to NH<sub>4</sub>+ (Table S4, Supporting Information), suggesting that the "NCO" pathway predominates. This is due to that the local microenvironment of  $V_N$  and Ni sites increase the electron transfer of the proximal C-N bond adsorbed on  $Ni_3N-V_N$ , reduce the energy barrier of  $Ni_3N-V_N$  to break the proximal C-N bond, and finally promote the dissociation of the proximal C-N bond.

#### 3. Conclusion

In summary, we developed a nitrogen-vacancy engineering strategy to construct electron-rich Ni sites and electron-deficient V<sub>N</sub> local environments in the Ni<sub>3</sub>N-V<sub>N</sub>/NF UOR electrocatalyst. This unique microenvironment guides the reaction along the "NCO-" pathway and promotes the formation of NiOOH. Due to the dominance of the "NCO" pathway on Ni<sub>3</sub>N-V<sub>N</sub>/NF, the UOR process undergoes minimal NiOOH/Ni(OH), conversion during the indirect oxidation reaction, significantly reducing the charge transfer resistance (R<sub>ct</sub>). Furthermore, the electron-rich Ni sites facilitate the formation of NiOOH, contributing to fast reaction kinetics. The optimized Ni<sub>3</sub>N-V<sub>N</sub>/NF(M) catalyst demonstrates exceptional UOR performance, achieving a low potential of 1.46 V at 1000 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, a remarkable Tafel slope of 32.1 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>, and robust stability. When integrated into a practical anion exchange membrane (AEM) electrolyzer, it achieves a current density of 600 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> at a cell voltage of 1.84 V with high stability, showcasing its potential for industrial applications. The "NCO" pathway minimizes NiOOH/Ni(OH)2 conversion because the electron-deficient  $V_{\scriptscriptstyle N}$  sites preferentially adsorb the electron-donating -NH2 group of urea, while the electron-rich Ni sites promote the dissociation of proximal C-N bonds. Additionally, the electron-rich Ni sites exhibit d-band centers closer to the Fermi level, which lowers the energy barrier for NiOOH formation, enabling Ni<sub>3</sub>N-V<sub>N</sub> to generate NiOOH at low potentials. This work not only provides a novel strategy for designing UOR catalysts with enhanced activity and stability but also offers new insights into the urea electrooxidation pathway on nickelbased catalysts. These findings pave the way for the development of efficient and sustainable electrocatalysts for energy conversion applications.

# The synthesis of W-Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub>/NiS nanosheets with heterostructure as a high-efficiency catalyst for urea oxidation†

Han Zhao, Min Liu, Xiaoqiang Du to \*a and Xiaoshuang Zhang \*b

The development of efficient and stable non-precious-metal-based electrocatalysts is essential for practical water splitting applications. The electrolysis of water for hydrogen production is a green and efficient method, while urea electrolysis can improve energy conversion efficiency. In this paper, W-Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub>/NiS catalysts with heterogeneous structures were synthesized via a one-step hydrothermal method using a W-doping-induced phase transition strategy. The doping of W modulates the morphology of the catalyst, which can form uniform nanorod arrays and improve the activity of the electrocatalyst. In an alkaline solution of 1 M KOH and 0.5 M urea, W-Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub>/NiS requires a potential of only 1.309 V to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. An electrolyzer containing urea with W-Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub>/NiS as both the cathode and anode can drive a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> with a potential of only 1.569 V and has relatively good stability after testing for 20 h. Experimental results show that the improvement in the catalytic activity is due to the rapid charge transfer, exposure of more active sites and better conductivity. Density functional theory calculations show that the W-Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub> material exhibits higher urea adsorption energy, indicating that urea is preferentially adsorbed on its surface. The NiS material shows more state density near the Fermi level, indicating that the introduction of this material enhances the conductivity of the W-Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub>/NiS material. The synergistic catalysis of the two materials promoted the improvement of the catalytic activity. This work provides new ideas for the development of highly efficient and stable catalysts by means of doping and interface construction.

### 1. Introduction

With the consumption of fossil fuels and the increase of environmental pollution, the exploration of renewable and sustainable energy sources has been encouraged and supported. Hydrogen energy is regarded as the "ultimate energy" in the 21st century because of its high energy density, zero pollution and zero carbon emissions. Hat energy sources a method that can be powered by renewable energy sources such as wind and solar, which is one of the key strategies for hydrogen production. Water splitting consists of two main half-reactions: the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at the cathode. In electrolytic water splitting, higher energy is required because of the slow kinetics for the OER with a

theoretical voltage of 1.23 V, but the final value of  $O_2$  produced is low.  $^{11-13}$  In order to reduce energy consumption, it is feasible to use other reactions to replace the OER.  $^{14-16}$  It is worth noting that methanol, glucose, urea and other oxidation reactions have a lower theoretical potential to replace the anode reaction. Among these reactions, the theoretical voltage for the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) is only 0.37 V.  $^{17-20}$  After the UOR, urea decomposes into inert  $N_2$  and  $CO_2$ .  $^{21,22}$  It also has the advantages of being harmless, low cost, and stable, and is considered one of the most promising alternatives to the OER.  $^{23,24}$  Replacing the OER with the UOR for electrocatalytic hydrogen production can effectively solve the problem of slow kinetics and improve energy conversion efficiency.  $^{25}$ 

UOR involves the transfer of six electrons, so the actual reaction process requires more energy to drive the UOR and HER than the ideal state of urea electrolysis and requires a catalyst to overcome the slowdown in reaction kinetics. According to the research, precious metals such as Ru and Pt are greatly restricted in terms of large-scale utilization and practical application due to their excessive price and scarcity, 26-28 and the development of low-cost and catalytically active non-precious metal catalysts is highly desirable. Due to the diversity, stability and theoretically high catalytic activity of

transition metals, recent research has focused on transitionmetal-based electrocatalysts. 29-31 It has been shown that nickel sulfide, 32,33 especially its composites with other metal sulfides, has superior UOR properties. For example, Liu et al. prepared catalysts with efficient UOR catalytic activity via in situ growth of multistage nickel sulfide composites on nickel foam with a potential of only 1.343 V at a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>.34 In addition, Zhou et al. prepared a Mo-NiS catalyst that exhibited excellent UOR/HER performances by introducing Mo<sup>4+</sup> with empty d orbitals into NiS nanoflowers with a cell voltage of 2 V at a current density of 1 A cm<sup>-2</sup>. 35 It is worth noting that Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub> is a typical representative of metal sulfides in transition metal dihalide compounds.36,37 In the crystal structure of Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub>, a continuous Ni triangle network is formed by its Ni-Ni bond connection, which causes Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub> to have remarkable metallic properties and excellent electrical conductivity, which is favorable for electrochemical reactions.  $^{38-40}$  Therefore, Ni $_3$ S $_2$ has good electrochemical stability and high electrical conductivity, and has great potential for industrial applications. 41-43 However, theoretical calculations and experimental results conducted by related scholars have shown that the low refractive index surface exposed causes Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub> to have low catalytic activity under alkaline conditions. 44,45 Therefore, it is urgent and necessary to improve the intrinsic catalytic activity of Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub> using various strategies. Among the various strategies, ion doping has been shown to be an effective way to increase the intrinsic activity and density of the active site. 46-48 Heteroatom doping can be used to change the electronic structure of the substrate material through orbital modulation or charge redistribution without changing the desired intrinsic characteristics, structure or composition of the substrate material.49-51 Doping with W is one of the effective ways to improve the catalyst activity, mainly by enhancing the interaction of the catalyst with intermediates during the reaction. Meanwhile, W doping can change the electronic structure of the catalyst and improve the electron conductivity and transmission efficiency.

In the present work, we report a strategy for W-dopinginduced structural transformation to construct nickel foam (NF)-supported W-Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub>/NiS heterojunction nanorod arrays. By controlling the amount of W doping to induce partial conversion of Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub> to NiS, W-Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub>/NiS electrodes with heterostructures were constructed to exhibit excellent UOR activity in a KOH electrolyte containing 0.5 M urea while requiring only 1.309 V at a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. In an electrolyzer containing urea, the electrode acts as both cathode and anode, and a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> can be obtained with a potential of only 1.569 V. Experimental results show that the improvement of the catalytic activity is due to the rapid charge transfer, exposure of more active sites and better conductivity. Density functional theory calculations show that the W-Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub> material exhibits higher urea adsorption energy, indicating that urea is preferentially adsorbed on its surface. The NiS material shows more state density near the Fermi level, indicating that the introduction of this material enhances the conductivity of the W-Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub>/NiS material. The synergistic catalysis

of the two materials promoted the improvement of catalytic activity.

#### **Experimental section** 2.

#### Pretreatment of nickel foam

Nickel foam (3 × 7 cm<sup>2</sup>) was sonicated in 3 M HCl and acetone for 15 min to remove the oxide layer and impurities on its surface, and rinsed with deionized water and ethanol several times alternately. The rinsed nickel foam was placed into a vacuum drying oven for four hours at 60 °C.

#### 2.2. Preparation of W-Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub>/NiS

Using an analytical balance, 0.25 g of thioacetamide (TAA, CH<sub>3</sub>CSNH<sub>2</sub>), 0.495 g of sodium tungstate (Na<sub>2</sub>WO<sub>4</sub>) and 0.04 g of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) were accurately weighed out, dissolved in 60 mL of deionized water and magnetically stirred for 30 min to obtain a clear and transparent solution. The above solution and the treated nickel foam were placed in a 100 mL autoclave, tightened and reacted at 160 °C for 12 h. After the reaction was completed and had cooled naturally to room temperature, the product was rinsed with deionized water and ethanol alternately and dried in a vacuum drying oven at 60 °C for 4 h to obtain the W-Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub>/NiS catalyst.

#### 2.3. Preparation of W-Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub>

Using an analytical balance, 0.25 g of TAA, 0.0355 g of Na<sub>2</sub>WO<sub>4</sub> and 0.04 g of PVP were accurately weighed out, dissolved in 60 mL of deionized water and magnetically stirred for 30 min to obtain a clear and transparent solution. The above solution and the treated nickel foam were placed in a 100 mL autoclave, tightened and reacted at 160 °C for 12 h. After the reaction was completed and had cooled naturally to room temperature, the product was rinsed with deionized water and ethanol alternately and dried in a vacuum drying oven at 60 °C for 4 h to obtain the W-Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub> catalyst.

#### 2.4. Preparation of Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub>

Use an analytical balance, 0.25 g of TAA and 0.04 g of PVP were accurately weighed out, dissolved in 60 mL of deionized water and stirred magnetically for 30 min to obtain a clear and transparent solution. The above solution and the treated nickel foam were placed in a-100 mL autoclave, tightened and reacted at 160 °C for 12 h. After the reaction was completed and had cooled naturally to room temperature, the product was rinsed with deionized water and ethanol alternately and dried in a vacuum drying oven at 60 °C for 4 h to obtain the Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub> catalyst.

#### Results and discussion 3.

The W-Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub>/NiS catalyst was prepared as shown in Scheme 1. The target catalyst was obtained by growing Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub>/NiS on an NF substrate using a one-step hydrothermal method, and the Sulfuration

formed W–Ni $_3$ S $_2$ /NiS has a heterogeneous structure, which can significantly improve the catalytic activity of the material. The thioacetamide in the reactants provides the S source, and PVP acts as a binder; its solubility and dispersibility are enhanced by dissolving it in ethanol alone. The 3D porous NF has a large specific surface area, which is conducive to the adhesion of the precipitate and acts as both a reaction substrate and a partial Ni source in the reaction. After the reaction, the color of the NF changes from silvery gray to dark black.

Fig. 1a shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra of W-Ni $_3$ S $_2$ /NiS. Comparison with the standard cards indicates that W-Ni $_3$ S $_2$ /NiS consists of a mixture of Ni $_3$ S $_2$  (PDF#71-1682) and NiS (PDF#01-1286). Three distinct strong peaks at 44.6°, 51.6° and 76.8° correspond to the (111), (200) and (220) diffraction plane of nickel foam. The additionally five peaks at 22.6°, 31.5°, 37.6°, 50.6° and 55.8° were indexed to the (101), (110), (003), (113) and (330) diffraction planes of the Ni $_3$ S $_2$  material. The other three peaks at 69.8°, 73.6° and 78.8° were indexed to the (511), (312) and (232) diffraction planes of the NiS material. The XRD characterization of W-Ni $_3$ S $_2$  and Ni $_3$ S $_2$  (Fig. 1b) matches the standard card Ni $_3$ S $_2$  (PDF#71-1682). No diffraction peak of the NiS material was observed for W-Ni $_3$ S $_2$  and Ni $_3$ S $_2$ , proving that the amount of tungstate can affect the composition of the material.

The SEM of W–Ni $_3$ S $_2$ /NiS at different magnifications is shown in Fig. 2a and b. It can be seen that the nanorods are uniformly arranged on the nickel foam, forming a beautiful mesh structure, increasing the open space and increasing the surface contact area between the catalyst and the electrolyte. Fig. S1 $^{\dagger}$  shows the SEM of W–Ni $_3$ S $_2$  at different magnifications, and a mesh structure with wire formation can be observed. The SEM of Ni $_3$ S $_2$  at different magnifications is shown in

Fig. S2,† in which most of the surface is corroded and only a few scattered nanorods are arranged. Fig. 2c shows the elemental mapping image of W-Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub>/NiS, in which S, W, and Ni are uniformly distributed on the catalyst surface, indicating the successful doping of W into the target sample. Further investigation of the microstructure and lattice information of W-Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub>/NiS with excellent catalytic oxidation performance was performed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The result reveals that the (3 2 1) crystal plane of NiS is closely connected with the (0 2 1) crystal plane of Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub>, forming a unique W-Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub>/NiS material with heterostructure (Fig. 2d and e). The presence of heterojunctions facilitates the rearrangement of local electrons, thus accelerating the charge transfer rate of the catalyst. As shown in Fig. 2e, the lattice spacing of 0.235 nm is in better agreement with the (0 2 1) plane of Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub>, and the lattice spacing of 0.167 nm is in good agreement with the (3 2 1) plane of NiS, which proves that the target sample contains the substances Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub> and NiS.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was further used to analyze the chemical composition and electronic state of the sample surface. The measured XPS spectra in Fig. S3a† show the presence of the elements Ni, S, and W in the target sample. In Fig. 3a, the peaks at 35.14 eV and 37.48 eV could correspond to W  $4f_{7/2}$  and W  $4f_{5/2}$  of W-Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub>/NiS, respectively, <sup>52,53</sup> which is attributed to W<sup>6+</sup>. Ni plays an important role in electrocatalysis; in Fig. 3b, for W-Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub>/NiS, the peaks at 855.47 eV and 856.95 eV and their corresponding satellite peaks are attributed to the Ni  $2p_{3/2}$  orbit, <sup>54,55</sup> while the

peaks at 855.47 eV and 856.95 eV are attributed to Ni<sup>2+</sup> and Ni<sup>3+</sup>, respectively, and the peaks at 873.21 eV and 875.21 eV and their corresponding satellite peaks are attributed to the Ni 2p<sub>1/2</sub> orbital, with the peaks at 873.21 eV and 875.21 eV being attributed to Ni<sup>2+</sup> and Ni<sup>3+</sup>, respectively. For Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub>, <sup>56,57</sup> the peaks at 855.36 eV and 856.56 eV and their corresponding satellite peaks belong to the Ni 2p<sub>3/2</sub> orbitals, while the peaks at 855.36 eV and 856.56 eV are attributed to Ni<sup>2+</sup> and Ni<sup>3+</sup>, respectively, and the peaks at 873.01 eV and 874.99 eV and their corresponding satellite peaks are attributed to Ni 2p<sub>1/2</sub> orbitals, of which the peaks at 873.01 eV and 874.99 eV are attributed to Ni<sup>2+</sup> and Ni<sup>3+</sup>, respectively. In the XPS spectrum of the S 2p region (Fig. 3c) for W-Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub>/NiS, the peak at 168.82 eV corresponds to the S-O bond, which is formed due to oxidation by exposure to air. The characteristic peaks located at 164.91 eV and 162.76 eV correspond to the S 2p<sub>1/2</sub> orbital and the S 2p<sub>3/2</sub> orbital, and the S 2p peak of Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub> is slightly positively shifted relative to that of W-Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub>/NiS, indicating that the S 2p in the W-Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub>/NiS with heterostructure caused the W configuration to have a lower binding energy. Fig. 3d shows the XPS pattern of O 1s; for W-Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub>/NiS, the peak O1 at 532.02 eV represents the water molecules adsorbed on the catalyst surface and the peak O2 at 531.06 eV is associated with metal-oxygen bonds. Compared to the O 1s orbitals of Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub>, the introduction of W significantly increases the area of O2 in Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub>, which is favorable to improve the electrocatalytic activity.

#### 3.1. Performance testing of W-Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub>/NiS

The UOR performance of the W–Ni $_3$ S $_2$ /NiS electrode was evaluated using linear scanning voltammetry (LSV). LSV curves for all samples were obtained by back-scanning in order to

exclude the effect of oxidation peaks on the catalytic potential of the material at low current densities. The catalytic performance was evaluated at a scan rate of 10 mV s<sup>-1</sup> in an electrolyte of 1 M KOH and 0.5 M urea using a standard three-electrode system. All potentials were iR-corrected and converted to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale by calibration with a reference Hg/HgO placed at the glassy carbon electrode. In comparison, the W-Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub>/NiS electrode has the most prominent UOR activity. In order to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, the optimized W-Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub>/NiS requires a relatively low potential, as can be clearly seen in Fig. 4a, in which the potential for W-Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub>/NiS is the lowest. Fig. 4b shows the voltage comparisons of NF, Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub>, W-Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub> and W-Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub>/NiS at current densities of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> and 50 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, respectively, and it can be clearly seen that W-Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub>/NiS shows the lowest voltages. Tafel plots (Fig. 4c) were used for the preliminary evaluation of the reaction kinetics for the UOR, in which the smaller the Tafel slope is, the better the reaction performance is. The results showed that the Tafel slope of W-Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub>/NiS is 22.86 mV, and the Tafel slopes of W-Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub>, Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub> and NF are 36.91 mV, 47.96 mV and 90.33 mV, respectively, which are all larger than that of W-Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub>/NiS, indicating that W-Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub>/NiS has the best reaction kinetics. Electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) is one of the important indicators to evaluate the

performance of electrocatalysts; it reflects the effective area of the electrochemical reaction. The double-layer capacitance  $C_{\rm dl}$ of the material in the UOR process was calculated using cyclic voltammetry curves (Fig. S4a and b†). It can be observed in Fig. 4d that W-Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub>/NiS has the largest  $C_{\rm dl}$  value of 16.06 mF cm<sup>-2</sup> and that the  $C_{\rm dl}$  values of W-Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub>, Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub> and NF are 13.96 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>, 5.286 mF cm<sup>-2</sup> and 1.546 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>, all of which are smaller than the C<sub>dl</sub> values of W-Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub>/NiS, indicating that W-Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub>/NiS had more active sites. Fig. 4e shows the impedance diagram, the smaller the radius of the curve is, the lower the charge transfer resistance is and the faster the electron transfer rate is. It can be seen that W-Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub>/NiS has the smallest radius and the smallest impedance. In the analog circuit, CPE is the constant phase element,  $R_1$  is the solution diffusion resistor, and  $R_2$  is the charge transfer resistor ( $R_{ct}$ ). Table S1† shows the charge transfer resistance of the catalyst calculated from the circuit model, and it can be seen that W-Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub>/NiS has the smallest curve radius with a charge transfer resistance value of 0.895 Ω. Our W-Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub>/NiS catalyst also exhibits better UOR performance compared to some recently reported catalysts (Fig. 4f and Table S2†).

Further performance tests were performed on the target samples to observe their stability. Fig. 5a shows the UOR stability test of W-Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub>/NiS in KOH electrolyte containing 0.5 M urea; its current density was stable at 20 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> after 20 h of operation at 1.45 V. Fig. 5b shows the LSV curves of W-Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub>/ NiS under the same conditions before and after the *i-t* test. The potential increased significantly after the i-t test at a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, probably because the W content attached to NF in electrolysis decreased (Fig. 6a), causing a reduction in the active sites of W-Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub>/NiS. From Fig. 5c, it can be seen that W-Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub>/NiS requires only 1.309 V to achieve the urea oxidation reaction at a current density of

10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. It is worth noting that under the same conditions, W-Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub>/NiS requires 1.537 V to achieve the same current density for the water oxidation reaction in 1 M KOH electrolyte without urea. Based on this superior UOR performance, a monolithic urea electrolyzer was assembled using W-Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub>/NiS with a heterogeneous structure in an electrolyte of 1 M KOH and 0.5 M urea, and its electrochemical performance was investigated. The lower potential of W-Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub>/NiS//W-Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub>/ NiS can be clearly observed in Fig. 5d.

The morphology of W-Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub>/NiS after the *i-t* test is shown in Fig. S5.† It can be seen that there is no significant change in the morphology, and the slight corrosion on its surface is caused by OOH\*. The catalyst surface was corroded under alkaline conditions for a long time for stability testing, which is presumed to be one of the main reasons for the decrease in stability. Fig. S6† shows the X-ray diffraction spectra (XRD) before and after the i-t test, and according to comparison with the standard cards, the W-Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub>/NiS after the *i-t* test consists of a mixture of Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub> (PDF#71-1682) and NiS (PDF#01-1286), which shows no significant change after i-t test. The XPS (Fig. 6a-d) results further demonstrate the stability of W-Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub>/NiS with a slight decrease in W 4f and S 2p. In Fig. 6d, the peak (O2) located at 530.77 eV in the O 1s spectrum after the reaction indicates an enhancement of metal-oxygen bonding, the presence of which implies a slight oxidation of the catalyst surface. Fig. S7† shows a comparison of the full spectrum before and after the i-t test, and the S and W contents were reduced. In addition, the structure of the material was changed by controlling the content of W. W-Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub> was synthesized using W-doping amounts of 0.5 mmol and 1.0 mmol. The experimental results show that changing the dopant content is important for the UOR (Fig. S8†).

The adsorption energies of W-Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub> and NiS on urea molecules were calculated using density functional theory (DFT). As shown in Fig. 7a and b, we optimized the ball-and-stick model for an adsorbed urea molecule on W-Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub> and NiS, and the corresponding urea adsorption energy histogram is shown in Fig. 7c. It is noteworthy that W-Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub> (-1.31 eV) adsorbs urea better than NiS (-0.83 eV), indicating that W-Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub> plays a major role in the catalytic decomposition of urea. In addition, as shown in Fig. 7d, the density of states (DOS) distribution of NiS near the Fermi energy level is higher than that of W-Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub>, indicating that the NiS electrode exhibits better metallic properties. Notably, Fig. S9 and S10† give the projected density of states (PDOS) for each atom of W-Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub> and NiS. The theoretical results show that the total density of states of W-Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub> mainly comes from the d-orbital of Ni, the p-orbital of S and the f-orbital of W. The total density of states of NiS comes mainly from the d-orbital of Ni and the p-orbital of S. In addition, comparing the PDOS of Ni in W-Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub> and NiS, a significant shift in the center of the d-band can be seen, indicating that W-doping can modulate the electronic structure and accelerate the electron transfer to improve the UOR activity.58 Further, the combination of Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub> and NiS was used as a model to research the mechanism using DFT (Fig. S11a and b†). It is noteworthy that the combination of the two materials enhances the adsorption of urea (-1.45 eV). Solvation effects were included in the calculation (Fig. S11c and d†). According to the theoretical analysis and calculation, NiS provides better electron conductivity and W-Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub> provides excellent urea adsorption energy, which together cause the W-Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub>/NiS catalyst to exhibit excellent UOR electrocatalytic activity.

## Conclusion

In summary, this work presents the W-doping-induced synthesis of W-Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub>/NiS nanorod arrays, and the W-Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub>/NiS

catalysts obtained using the primary hydrothermal method have good UOR activity with a potential of only 1.309 V at a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. The catalyst has abundant active sites and excellent electrocatalytic performance. The W-Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub>/NiS//W-Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub>/NiS electrolyzer requires cell voltages of only 1.569 V at a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> and exhibits relatively good stability. Experimental results show that the improvement of the catalytic activity is due to the rapid charge transfer, exposure of more active sites and better conductivity. Density functional theory calculations show that the W-Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub> material exhibits higher urea adsorption energy, indicating that urea is preferentially adsorbed on its surface. The NiS material shows more state density near the Fermi level, indicating that the introduction of this material enhances the conductivity of the W-Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub>/NiS material. The synergistic catalysis of the two materials promoted the improvement of catalytic activity. The present work provides new insights to study the practical applications of using atomic doping for inducing structural phase transitions to improve hydrogen production performance in electrolyzers using urea as the electrolyte.

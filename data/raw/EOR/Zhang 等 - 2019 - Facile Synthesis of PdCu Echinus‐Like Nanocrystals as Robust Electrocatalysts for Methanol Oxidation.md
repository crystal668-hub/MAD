#### **INTRODUCTION**

According to the World Health Organization, headache disorders are the most common disorders of the nervous system.<sup>1</sup> It is also generally accepted that headache is the most common chief complaint in neurology clinical practice. Regardless of whether a trainee elects to sub-specialize or to enter general practice, it is essential for every neurologist to have a solid foundation in headache medicine. There are only a small proportion of neurology residency programs in the country that have a mandatory headache rotation for their adult neurology residents. In a 2016 crosssectional study assessing the status of headache didactics and clinical training in 133 adult neurology residency programs in the United States, it was found that 19 programs (26% of the 72 programs that responded)

had a mandatory headache rotation as a graduation requirement for neurology residents.<sup>2</sup>

In our residency program, adult neurology PGY-2 residents spend 1 half day of clinic each week in headache clinic, during their 2-4 weeks of sub-specialty clinic rotation. Headache faculty perceived a knowledge gap in procedural training and the ability of residents to diagnose and manage uncommon headache disorders. According to the ACGME Neurology Milestone project, level 4 in the headache milestones corresponds with the ability of a resident to "diagnose and manage uncommon headache syndromes" and is the target for graduation.<sup>3</sup> Yet, there was confidence among residents that they already knew what they needed to know about headache management, despite the lack of general awareness of the actual diagnostic criteria and treatment options for even the most common primary headache disorders. It was clear that there was a need for better, more formalized headache education. In 2017, we worked to convince our department's education committee to establish a mandatory headache rotation for all adult neurology residents.

#### **CHALLENGES**

There are a number of expressed biases against establishing a required headache rotation in residency programs. In 2 studies, it was shown that program directors feel that the overwhelming majority of their residents are already adequately trained in the management of headache.4,5 In Ahmed and Faulkner's paper from 2016, it was found that 96% of program directors believed their residents were adequately prepared to diagnose and treat headache disorders.2 The authors suspected that there was non-response bias which could have resulted in overrepresentation of headache education in neurology residency.

At academic centers, there is a growing trend toward an inpatient heavy rotation schedule, especially during the earlier half of adult neurology residency training. As an example, at our institution, adult neurology residents in the class of 2015 had 9 weeks of elective during PGY-2 year which were typically devoted to outpatient rotations. Seven years later, the class of 2022, will have had 3 weeks of elective during PGY-2 year. As a result, residents are less likely to have exposure to rotations such as headache and other primarily outpatient sub-specialties in the early part of their training which is critical in laying the foundation for the rest of residency. Every sub-specialty would like to have a required rotation, but in the setting of an inpatient heavy rotation schedule, it is challenging for neurology residency program directors to accommodate every request for a required rotation.

Finally, resistance can also come from current residents. There is the perception by some residents that the elective rotation is a way to figure out which fellowship to do, rather than a part of a broad and well-rounded education. In the setting of limited elective time during the first year of neurology residency, residents would prefer to have freedom to choose how they spend that elective time. In addition, residents may feel they see plenty of headache cases in other clinical settings and do not see the value in training additionally with headache specialists.

#### **APPROACH TO THE EDUCATION COMMITTEE**

At many academic programs, decisions about which rotations to include as mandatory versus elective are made by a committee with that specific charge. At our institution, that is the Education Committee.

**Step 1. Demonstrating a Need.—**Our program was in the situation that Ahmed and Faulkner described, wherein headache specialists were not directly involved in neurology residency education. It is important for a faculty member who can accurately assess and communicate headache-related knowledge gaps to be a part of the Clinical Competency Committee. At our institution, this was a headache faculty member who was asked to be on the committee in 2017, which was the first time that the headache faculty was represented on the committee. The presence and input of the headache faculty helped to prevent potential overinflation of headache medicine milestone scores by other faculty on the committee who are not headache specialists. Based on this input from headache faculty who have had direct interactions with residents, it was made clear that there was an unmet need for better training in diagnosis and management of uncommon headaches, as recommended by the ACGME, as well as, in procedures.

Resident feedback and support of the rotation was also an integral component of demonstration of need. We interviewed the most recent class of adult neurology residency graduates on this topic. To be inclusive, we also interviewed the most recent class of pediatric neurology residency graduates. With only 2 pediatric neurology residents available to respond, we did not feel we could generalize the interview responses to the pediatric program. We chose this particular class because they had experienced neurology residency in its entirety but were not too distant from it either. We expected this sample to give honest and candid answers because they all had set fellowship positions in sub-specialties outside of headache. Only 2 out of 8 had chosen to do a headache elective during residency, and any changes or repercussions from this interview that would alter the rotation schedule would not affect them. Individual emails were sent to each of the residents informing them that the headache division and the residency program directors were considering a mandatory headache rotation in the residency schedule, likely during PGY-2 of PGY-3 year. The specific questions we asked included:

*Headache* 3

• In retrospect, do you think it would have been helpful to have a mandatory headache rotation?

- Is 2 weeks too short or too long?
- Should this rotation take place during PGY-2 or PGY-3 year?
- Do you have any other suggestions for how we can improve headache education during residency?

In summary, there was a 100% response rate (8/8 residents responded). Seven out of 8 residents answered that a mandatory headache rotation during residency would have been helpful and that they supported establishing such a rotation. They reported a need for more teaching of uncommon headache disorders and more procedure teaching. The 1 resident who did not think such a rotation would be helpful nor necessary reported, "I felt comfortable with managing headache with all the patients we already see in other settings so I didn't feel a headache elective would be that helpful to me." All residents answered that 2 weeks would be the best length of time. Only 1 out of 8 residents thought it would be feasible to have the rotation during PGY-2 year. All other residents answered that it would not be feasible to have the rotation during PGY-2 year because the residents already have so little elective time and that they should have the freedom to choose what they want to do with the little remaining elective time.

**Step 2. Presenting the Remedy.—**There are a number of approaches to addressing the need for better, more formalized headache education in neurology residency. For some programs, ensuring that headache neurologists staff general neurology services, resident continuity clinics, or inpatient services could bring headache expertise to settings that frequently involve management of headache disorders. In an institution with an active headache program, we did not have the resources to consistently send headache faculty to the general neurology clinics and inpatient services. Thus, our approach was to establish a mandatory headache rotation.

An important step was to demonstrate to the Education Committee that the purpose of the rotation was not to turn residents into headache specialists, but rather to focus on gaps in the residents' knowledge and skill set, and to provide a well-rounded education to all residents. We proposed that 2 weeks would lay the foundation for what they must know and allow them to see the gaps in their knowledge, such that they could better assess when to seek headache expert support. Headache commonly arises as a primary or secondary issue for patients that residents see throughout residency, so it is extremely helpful to train with the headache team and lay the groundwork for understanding proper management of headache patients. Continuity clinic and hospital attendings do not share the expertise of the headache specialists. This knowledge and skill set will help them throughout residency and will be an invaluable asset for them regardless of whether they sub-specialize or enter general practice. From a programmatic standpoint, rotation through essential sub-specialty clinics helps our residents reach ACGME milestones.

We proposed a 2-week, high-yield rotation, taught by headache specialists from the Division of Headache Medicine, that focused on diagnosis of common and uncommon headache disorders, medical management (with a multidisciplinary team), and an introduction to procedural skills. We presented a formal syllabus that detailed goals, expectations, clinical duties, didactic assignments, reading list, and ample opportunity for feedback.

### **THE ROTATION**

After a formal presentation to the Education Committee, the decision was put to a vote. The Committee voted to approve a mandatory headache rotation for all Adult Neurology PGY-3 residents. The new rotation began in the fall of 2018. For the first year of the rotation, we designed an orientation that included teaching of history and exam skills, using electronic medical record Smart phrases as a teaching tool, and hands-on teaching of procedures. Specifically, we taught residents how to take a headache history and do a thorough head and neck exam, in addition to the neurological exam. The introduction didactic on Smart phrases was a way to give the residents a broad but concise tour of headache clinical practice ranging from explanation of migraine pathophysiology for patients, to headache medication dosing, to resources and patient counseling on pain psychology, acupuncture, biofeedback, and the myriad of treatment strategies available to patients. This has become one of the most useful and lasting tools for residents after they complete the 4 *Month 2019*

rotation. These phrases are disseminated among nonneurology residents, medical students, and attending physicians outside of headache clinic. The procedures that were taught included injection of onabotulinum toxin A for chronic migraine, occipital nerve blocks, and trigger point injections. Residents first practiced on a mannequin, then watched the attending perform the procedure. This was followed by the resident performing 1 portion of the procedure, and then performing a procedure in its entirety. For the rest of the rotation, residents worked with 5 different attendings in a total of 16 half days of clinic over 2 weeks (about a quarter of the times was spent on procedures). Residents were also required to attend weekly headache didactics with our fellows. In addition, residents were asked to present at weekly case conference, as well as, present 1 journal club during the rotation.

A total of 7 adult neurology PGY-3 residents completed the rotation during the 2018-2019 academic year. We received written feedback at the end of the year. We asked the residents to rate their overall educational experience on a 5-point Likert scale, with 1 being "Poor and not relevant at all" and 5 being "Excellent and highly relevant." The overall rating of the rotation was "Excellent and highly relevant." The strengths of the program included learning diagnosis and management of common and uncommon headache disorders, exposure to useful resources for patients, discussions about the pros and cons of emerging therapeutics, the opportunity to learn procedures, and attentive teaching by faculty. The areas in which the residents suggested improvement included more guidance on expectations for journal club, more procedure teaching, and more formal teaching, based on topic, during clinic sessions. One of the residents eloquently summarized the rotation in the following comments:

"I think this is a key resource for me, both from an academic, as well as, practical standpoint. It allowed the chance to learn nuanced history taking techniques, counseling techniques, and practical recommendations for my own continuity clinic patients. I think this rotation can significantly expand the unique aspect of procedure technique (either with more practice with patients in the clinic, or with dedicated simulation sessions). Understanding the variety of lifestyle, medical and procedural therapeutics for headache makes this an invaluable rotation for any resident preparing to be generalized (or specialized) neurologist."

For next steps, we would ideally schedule this rotation during PGY-2 year. Early exposure to headache medicine would lay the foundation of headache knowledge for the rest of residency, and it would facilitate a more balanced and informed decision as residents decide on a subspecialty. Residents who choose to use their elective time during PGY-2 year for the headache rotation, should be exempt from the PGY-3-year headache rotation if they wish. For education outcome studies, our faculty should develop an adequate pre- and post-rotation written exam that measures progress toward reaching ACGME milestones. In addition, we should consider surveying residents after residency to determine if they still hold the view that it was beneficial to have a mandatory headache rotation during residency.

#### **CONCLUSION**

Among neurology educators, no consensus has been reached on the optimal amount of headache education that is needed during neurology residency; however, most educators do agree that current headache education is underrepresented in neurology residency. The ACGME Milestones initiative, which was introduced into neurology residency programs in 2014 may provide objective data that could be helpful. In our program, there was an unmet need for mandatory headache education. A well-orchestrated campaign to bring awareness to the Education Committee resulted in approval of a mandatory headache rotation. The first year of this rotation has been a success, with excellent feedback. We hope our experience can help other headache programs in their efforts toward establishing such a rotation for their residents.

Boron-doped carbon nanocage (BC-2) was used as carrier to anchor palladium nanoparticles and enhanced the catalytic performance for the ethanol oxidation reaction. The BC-2 was synthesized via thermal treatment the predesigned compound containing cobalt and boron at 900 °C with the help of hydrogen and acid washing process. Palladium nanoparticles can be loaded on the BC-2 supports (Pd/BC-2) for ethanol oxide reaction (EOR). The BC-2 support has the following character-

istics: (i) The hollow structure contains highly order nanoporous to offer more channel and space in catalysis process; (ii) boron-doped carbon structures can supply abundant activity sites for stabilizing palladium nanoparticles; (iii) the unique three-dimensional architecture can prevent the agglomeration and inactivation of metal catalysts. The Pd/BC-2 catalyst displays higher catalytic activities 3614.11 mA mg<sup>-1</sup> toward the peak current density compared to that of Pd/C (804.39 mA mg<sup>-1</sup>).

#### 1. Introduction

Fuel cell is one type of energy conversion device that used the chemical energy stored in the fuel to convert it to electrical energy without combustion process.<sup>[1]</sup> Direct ethanol fuel cells (DEFCs) serving as classical fuel cells are potential power supply for mobile phones, automobile owing to their superior theoretical power density, inexpensive alcohol fuel, non-toxic to the environment, and rapid start-up under low temperaturez.[2-7] The high cost, sluggish kinetics and limited reserve of platinum based electrocatalysts are the main hinder for the development and businesslike applications of DAFCs. [8-9] Therefore, the development of other novel catalysts with high electrocatalytic activity and stability for ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) has aroused sustained attentions. So far, palladium (Pd) catalysts have been proved to be a kind of promising electrocatalysts of EOR for lower cost, higher electrocatalytic property in the alkaline solution.[10-16] The stabilities and performance to EOR principally relay on carriers and active components of electrocatalysts.[17-21] For palladium based catalysts, it is imperative to explore other electrocatalyst carriers with specific structure and component characteristic.

Among these substrates, carbon supports are the main carriers of fuel cell catalysts.<sup>[22]</sup> In consequence, various carbon based carrier materials of palladium based catalysts are investigated, including carbon nanotubes, carbon black, graphene, fullerene, carbon nanocage, etc.[23-29] The unique carbon electrocatalyst substrates with large electrical conductivity, high surface area and pore volume can anchor metal nanoparticles (NPs) uniformly via abundant active sites of supports, which are beneficial to chemical reagent  $transmission.^{\tiny{[30-31]}}\ In\ these\ carbon\ carriers,\ heteroatom\ doped$ carbon is one kind of candidate electrocatalyst support to highly enhance fuel oxide reaction by prior theory and experiment research.[32-34] Boron could math with the carbon space lattice extremely when carbon substance is doped by B atom, because the atomic diameter of boron resembles the one of carbon atom.[33] Furthermore, boron is less electronegative than carbon and can act as an electron-withdrawing site when entering carbon lattice.[34-35] Boron-doped carbon material can be used in strengthening the interaction between metal nanoparticles and boron active site, [36-37] which maybe has an impact on the stability, dispersion and chemical properties of surface metal nanoparticles. Accordingly, it has been observed that Bdoped carbonaceous material efficiently improved the Pd-based catalytic performances compared with undoped carbon catalyst support in several catalytic processes.[34,38-40]

As support for fuel cell reaction process, hollow boron-doped carbon materials had aroused great attention, due to its several superiorities, such as unique hollow architecture, large special surface area and abundant B-doped active site. Hence, hollow boron-doped carbon architecture can anchor metal nanoparticles, prevent aggregation of metal NPs, and promote electrolyte permeation and charge transmission to improve the catalytic performance. Most B-doped porous carbon is manufactured by CVD, hard-templating approach, organic-organic coassembly synthesis method. [41-43] However, few studies focus on

**Scheme 1.** Representation of fabrication of BC-2 and Pd/BC-2.

the synthesis of hollow B-doped carbon by the high-temperature pyrolysis metal organic compound.

In this work, the B-doped carbon nanocage was synthesized via pyrolysis of the predesigned compound containing cobalt and B (named Co-BA compound) at 900°C with the help of H2 and acid washing Process. The formation of Metallic Cobalt nanoparticles and acid etching process caused the hollow inner and porous outer structure, meanwhile the high content B was doped into carbon lattice. Moreover, the morphology and construction properties of the BC platforms could also be adjusted by the heat treatment temperature. The suitable temperature for formation of BC-2 was 900°C. The unique hollow inner and porous outer structure can provide larger pore volume and special surface to control the aggregation of catalysts. Besides, more grappling sites from boron-doped into carbon lattice can be supplied to favorably stabilize Pd NPs. Then, we manufactured hollow B-doped carbon nanocage-like supported Pd catalysts (denoted as Pd/BC-2) for EOR in an alkaline environment via an effective route. Compared to the general boron-doped carbon (BC-1, BC-3) and C, the borondoped hollow structure with larger surface area and more active site improved the electrocatalytic activity of Pd NPs to EOR. Regarding as electrocatalytic carrier, BC-2 doped by high boron content is beneficial to anchoring Pd NPs, owing to the doped boron can afford plentiful activity sites. Furthermore, BC-2 with hollow inner and porous outer structure can also be favorable for chemical reagent and charge transmission in catalysis process. Therefore, the hollow B-doped carbon nanocage can serve as a support candidate toward direct ethanol fuel cells.

# **2. Results and Discussion**

#### **2.1. Structure and Morphology**

As shown in Scheme 1, firstly, a compound containing cobalt and B (named Co-BA compound) was produced by coordination between 5-boronoisophthalic acid (5-bop) and Cobalt (II) acetate tetrahydrate in methanol solution at room temperature. Secondly, the B-doped carbon nanocage was synthesized via Co-BA compound pyrolysis at 900°C with the help of H2 and acid washing Process. Palladium nanoparticles (Pd NPs) were adorned on the porous BC serving Na2PdCl4 as the Pd raw material with dihydrate trisodium citrate reduction. The Co2<sup>+</sup> was easily with benzene dicarboxylic acid to from metal organic coordination compound.[44–45] Similarly, we produced the Co-BA compound via coordination between Co2<sup>+</sup> and 5-bop containing M-phenyl dicarboxylic acid. As shown in Figure S1 (A), the SEM image of Co-BA compound is amorphous complex. Figure S1 (B) recorded the Fourier transform infrared spectra (FTIR) spectra of 5-bop and Co-BA compound. The C=O stretching vibration (νC<sup>=</sup>O) peak of 5-bop was at 1715 cm <sup>1</sup> , but could not be found in Co-BA compound. As a result, carboxylic groups coordinated to Co2<sup>+</sup> to form compound. The B O absorption peak is observed at 1373 cm <sup>1</sup> in both 5-bop and Co-BA compound, indicating that the boron element was found in the compound. The Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) carried on Co-BA compound revealed this compound good thermal stability **(**Figure S1C**)**. The TGA graphs show a gradual weight-loss step of 28.7% (25–420°C) and a stable platform (300–420°C).

Both Figure 1A and 1B display the SEM images of porous BC-2. It reveals that the porous BC nanocage-like appearance with the size between 50~300 nm. The formation of Metallic Cobalt nanoparticles with the help of H2 in the heat treatment procedure leads to the morphology of open voids.[46] The SEM image of high magnification **(**Figure 1B**)** can be observed that

some pores (*<*50 nm) on the out wall of the hollow BC microspheres. This porous BC nanocage structure can facilitate the ion diffusion and be beneficial to improving the electrocatalytic ethanol oxidation activity. Figure 1C, D shows the SEM images of Pd/BC-2, the Pd NPs is evenly decorated on the surface of BC. The hollow BC-2 structure is furtherly observed by TEM (Figure 2). Figure 2A, B verifies the unique porous outer

wall and nanocage-like structure with sufficient open voids of BC-2 in accordance with the SEM view. This unique structure furnishes enough space for the catalysis. Therefore, the innumerable Pd nanoparticles are uniformly loaded with both external and internal walls of the BC-2 nanocage (Figure 2D). Pyrolysis temperature is the key of the BC nanocage structure formation. No BC nanocage can be observed when the heat temperature is 800°C, while only a spot of broken BC nanocage produced at 1000°C can be seen (Figure S1). The 900°C is suitable for forming B-doping porous BC nanocage-like material.

Furthermore, the high-magnification TEM analysis (HRTEM) also was applied to observing the microscopic structure. As shown in Figure 3A, B, the boron-doped carbon support has a crude appearance, which is suitable of deposition of Pd NPs. As observed in Figure 3C, the BC-2 frameworks can tightly grapple the Pd NPs with homogeneous dimensions. The mean measurement of Pd nanoparticles dimension is 3.64�0.81 nm, according to the numerical statement from a quantity of 100 selected clear Pd NPs (Figure 3C insert). The interplanar spaces for BC-2 and Pd NPs are surveyed from two distinct crystal lattice stripes as 0.341, 0.219 nm (Figure 3D), respectively, and accordance with the past reports.[47] The 0.341 nm crystal lattice stands for the exhibit graphite structure, indicating that the Co-BA compound has turn into B-doped graphitized carbon material. As displayed in Figure 3 E, the elements of C, O, B and Pd are covered over the whole BC-2 support homogeneously from the elemental mapping patterns.

The XRD patterns of Pd/BC-2, BC-2, BC-1, BC-3 were generalized in Figure 4A, B. For Pd/BC-2 nanocomposites, XRD

peak can be assigned to the Face Center Cubic crystal of palladium [JCPDS no. 46-1043]. Figure 4B reveals the structure characteristic of three BC samples with different pyrolysis temperatures. The broad peak around 26° (2 θ) of BC-1, BC-2, BC-3 shows a typical graphitic carbon (002) diffraction peak. It also testifies that the Co element was removal after acid etchant and the Co-BA coordination compound was changed into porous B-doping carbon materials via thermal treatment. BC-2 has lower graphitic carbon than the other two samples, according to the much wider XRD (002) peak of BC-2 than that of the BC-1and BC-3. To explore the BC crystal feature, the Raman spectra of BC-1, BC-2, BC-3 was lastly investigated, and shown in Figure 4 **C**. The two distinct Raman shift peaks of three BC samples are correspond with the typical D and G band of graphitic carbon, which can be seen at 1335, 1587 cm <sup>1</sup> , [48] separately. The D band of 1335 cm <sup>1</sup> is from the breathing modes of the of sp2 C atom, which express the shortcoming of graphitic crystal plane and the heteroatom doping of carbon lattice.[49–50] Meanwhile, the G band intensity (�1587 cm <sup>1</sup> ) relies on the degree of carbon atoms sp2 hybridization. Therefore, the intensity rate (*I*D/*I*G) can indicate the defect degree, which is positively correlated. It can be seen the *I*D/*I*<sup>G</sup> of BC-1, BC-2 and BC-3 are 1.13, 1.27 and 1.20, respectively. Obviously, the *I*D/*I*<sup>G</sup> of BC-2 is higher than other BC samples. It is potentially attributed to the imperfection caused by certain B-doping degree and unique hollow structures.[51–52]

The N2 adsorption/desorption experiment was carried out to analyze the surface and pore structure. As shown in Figure 5, the invertible curves of N2 adsorption/desorption for three BC

are all type IV isotherms with hysteresis loops H4, proving that the three samples mainly include the middle pore structure. Table S1 summarized the special surface area and pore volume distributions of BC-1, BC-2 and BC-3. The surface area of BC-2 is tested to be 859.15 m2g <sup>1</sup> , which is larger than those of BC-1, BC-2 (842.25, 497.21 m2g <sup>1</sup> , respectively). Such similar trends of pore and mesoporous volume could be observed. The pore diameter distribution was calculated by BJH (Barret-Joyner-Halenda) method. For BC-2, the pore diameter distributions is mainly about 2~4, 20~40 nm (Figure 5D), which corresponds to middle pore. The pore diameter distributions of BC-1 has similar curve as BC-2 (Figure S4A).The BC-3 also include the middle pore structure with the pore diameter distribution of 2~ 4 nm (Figure S4B). This abounded perforated structure of BC-2 can remarkably improve the catalytic ability of EOR to supply more active sites and spaces.

The surface situation and boron doping carbon properties in the BC-1, BC-2, BC-3 and Pd/BC-2 were employed via XPS measurement. Figure 6A, B displays the three typical peaks, which binding energies are 284.3 (C 1s), 530.0 (O 1s), and 191.0 (B 1s) eV.[53] The O1s peak in these B-doped porous carbon materials is observed possibly due to the superficial adsorbed oxygen.[54] The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy bight of Pd/ BC-2 and BC-2 is charted in Figure 6A. It reveals that the 336.7 eV binding energy of Pd/BC-2 matched with representational Pd 3d signal peak. As displayed in Figure 6 C, Pd 3d spectrum of Pd/BC-2 can be decomposed into Pd 3d5/2 and Pd 3d3/2 doubles, which are matched with two electronic states of Pd.[55] The binding energy of Pd (0) appears at 336.1 eV (Pd 3d5/ 2) and 341.45 eV (Pd 3d3/2), while these of Pd (II) state can be seen at 336.9 eV (3d5/2) and 342.4 eV (3d3/2).[56] The Pd (0) has more comparative valence than Pd (II) state in the Pd/BC-2 on

account of the cumulative strength ratio. Compared to binding energy (188.0 eV) of the pure boron, the higher shift of the B 1s signal reveals that the sp2 carbon lattice exists boron.[53] The atomic percentages of B are of important significance of Bdoping porous carbon materials. The compositions of the three BC specimen were classified in the Table S2. The B/C rate of BC-2 is 0.038, which is 1.73 times that of BC-1 and 1.12 times the one of BC-3. The elementary analysis by XPS also suggests a correspondingly high level of boron (3.32%) in BC-2.[57] The B1s spectrogram including the BC-1, BC-2 and BC-3 samples **(**Figure 6D, 6E, 6F**)** can be generally deconvoluted into two peaks, which are agreement with B C (191.3 eV) and B O (192.5 eV) bonds.[58] The ratio of B C to B O content of the three BC materials is 3.16, 5.83, 4.00, suggesting that the BC-2 has the most highest ratio of B C bond in the BC-1, BC-2 and B C-3 supports. The apparently more higher-load of B–C bond

in BC-2 demonstrates that the special boron-doped carbon nanocage produced at 900°C has an advantage for the B C bond formation.

## **2.2. Electrocatalytic Property of EOR**

The electrocatalytic activity and secular endurance were carried out to observe the electrochemical catalysis performance of the Pd/BC catalysts toward EOR, and a commercial Pd /C were taken as contrast **(**Figure 7**)**. Meanwhile, the particular data was recorded in Tables 1. In order to quantitative comparison of electrocatalytic active sites, the electrochemical surface area (ECSA) was analyzed on the basis of the PdO reduction coulombic charge.[38] The ECSA was estimated by Equation S1. The computed ECSA of Pd/BC-2 is 67.0 m2g <sup>1</sup> , which is higher

than that of Pd/BC-1 (62.7 m $^2$ g $^{-1}$ ) and Pd/BC-3 (47.8 m $^2$ g $^{-1}$ ) and is about 2.5 times as large as commercial Pd/C (27.0 m $^2$ g $^{-1}$ ). The generally agreed mechanism of EOR on Pd in alkaline solution includes the following four steps with the acetate ions as the major products. While a small amount of CH $_3$ CO $_{ads}$  species was decomposed to CH $_x$  and CO fragments, which can be further oxidized to CO $_2$ .

$$OH^- \rightarrow OH_{ads} + e^- \tag{2}$$

$$CH_3CO_{ads} + OH_{ads} \rightarrow CH_3COOH$$
 (3)

$$CH3COOH + OH- \rightarrow CH3COO- + 3H2O$$
 (4)

The larger ECSA of Pd/BC-2 is probably owing to the special hollow structure and B-doping, which offers more active sites for Pd NPs to anchor and well disperse on the BC-2 support. [27,34]

Figure 7B presents the electrocatalytic activity from CV curves of EOR in a mixture of 1 M EtOH and 1 M KOH. The vertical coordinates of current density are standardized via the Pd chemical mass loading. Obviously, all CV curves display two peaks. One is the peak current density in the forward anodic scan  $(j_f)$  and another is the peak current density in the backward scan  $(j_r)$ . Therefore, the  $j_f$  can be used to assess the electrocatalytic properties. For Pd/BC-2, the  $j_{\rm f}$  is 3614.11 mA mg<sup>-1</sup>, which gains the advantage over the values for the Pd/BC-1  $(3026.92 \text{ mA mg}^{-1})$ , Pd/BC-3  $(2502.84 \text{ mA mg}^{-1})$ , and Pd/C (804.39 mA mg<sup>-1</sup>) catalysts (Table 1). Therefore, the  $i_f$  is about 3.5-fold larger than the one of Pd/C. The EOR electrocatalysis activities of Pd/BC catalysts are higher, compared with various reports in prevenient literature about ECSA value and peak current density of Pd-based electrocatalysts on EOR (Table S3). Besides, j, represents the Pd oxide is reduced to zero-valence Pd and the active sites would be recovered. [20] Furthermore, the ratio of  $j_t/j_t$  can be expressed to evaluate the poisoning tolerance of carbonaceous species for as produced catalysts. [59] The  $j_{\epsilon}/j_{\epsilon}$  of Pd/BC-1, Pd/BC-2, Pd/BC-3 and Pd/C is 1.02,1.02,1.05, 0.63 (Table 1), indicating that the three Pd/BC catalysts have more superior performance than Pd/C. Simultaneously, the onset potential ( $E_{onset}$ ) of the Pd/BC-2 sample is the more negative than another one, which demonstrates an accelerated kinetics to EOR on Pd/BC-2.[25] The CVs of the Pd/BC-2 with different KOH concentrations were examined at 1.0 M EtOH. The  $j_f$  firstly has a great increased current density with increasing the KOH concentrations from 0.1 to 1.0 M and

**Figure 8.** (A) Linear sweep voltammetric curves of Pd/BC-1, Pd/BC-2, Pd/BC-3 and Pd/C in KOH /EtOH 1.0 M solution, the inset is the Tafel slopes; (B) COstripping curved lines in KOH solution (1 M, scan rate: 50 mVs 1 ).

gradually decreases when further increasing the KOH concentrations from 1.0 to 2.0 M. This confirms that the increasing OH can facilitate the electrocatalytic oxidation of ethanol in low KOH concentration, and the excessive OH can inversely inhibit the electrocatalytic reaction of ethanol. Figure S5 obviously displays that the peak potential has a negative shift with increasing KOH concentration, indicating an easier electrocatalytic oxidation of alcohol molecules with increased OH concentration. The above analysis indicate the enhanced catalytic activity and fast kinetics of Pd/BC-2 for EOR in 1.0 M KOH/ EtOH solution.

Chronoamperometric (CA) projects were carried out to investigate the durableness of these composites in 1.0 M KOH /EtOH liquors for 4000 s at 0.4 V, and the CA curved shapes can be seen in Figure 7C. The current density (*j*c) of Pd/BC-2 is much higher than *j*<sup>c</sup> of Pd/BC-1, Pd/BC-3 and Pd/C throughout the testing procedure. The CV cycling experiments of the synthetical catalysts were explored for 1000 cycles also in 1.0 M KOH /EtOH solution. Figure 7D displays the *j*<sup>f</sup> - cycle number drawing. The *j*<sup>f</sup> increases until the maximum at about the 40th cycle and then decreases gradually with the number increasing. The *j*<sup>f</sup> of Pd/BC-2 is much superiority than that of other two Pd/ BC materials and Pd/C, confirming its advantage on durability and electrocatalytic activity. The TEM images of Pd/BC-2 after 1000 cycle durability tests were shown in Figure S6. The borondoped carbon nanocage morphology was observed clearly and the innumerable Pd nanoparticles are loaded with a slight reunite. It demonstrates the stable nanocage structure of BC-2 after 1000 cycle electrocatalytic tests. Given the above results, the porous B-doping Pd/BC-2 nanocage maybe a promising catalyst toward EOR with superior electrocatalytic active and good durableness.

Figure 8A shows the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) of the four Pd-based catalysts. The kinetic activity was furtherly investigated by the Tafel slope obtained by the LSV curve. The Tafel slope of Pd/BC-2 is 184.2 mVs 1 , which is lower than that of Pd/BC-1 (190.1 mVs 1 ), Pd/BC-3 (194.8 mVs 1 ) and Pd/C (195.0 mVs 1 ). The lower Tafel slope of Pd/BC-2 indicates the faster charge-transfer kinetics to the EOR.[43] The results confirm fast kinetics and more easily achieved of the Pd/BC-2 to EOR. The superior anti-CO poisoning ability of Pd/BC-2 was confirmed by the CO-stripping (1 M KOH) displayed in Figure 8B. The peak potential (*E***<sup>c</sup>** °**f**) and onset potential (*E*<sup>c</sup> °onset) were applied to evaluating the CO poisoning tolerance of the electrocatalysts. The peak of oxidation CO adsorbed on the catalyst surface can be seen at about 0.180 V, and the Pd/BC-2 has the most negative peak potential among the four Pdbased catalysts. Moreover, the *E*<sup>c</sup> °onset of Pd/BC-2, Pd/BC-1 and Pd/BC-3 are shifted negatively by 24, 19, 18 mV comparing with Pd/C, and Pd/BC-2 also has the most negative onset potential (Table 2). The result indicated the Pd/BC-2 catalysts have the advance resistance of CO poisoning performance.[60–61]

As suggested previously, the Pd/BC-2 has the advance electrocatalytic activity, stability and anti-CO poisoning performance compared with those of Pd/BC-1, Pd/BC-3 and Pd/C. The excellent electrochemical behavior toward ethanol oxide reaction mainly attributes to the unique hollow architectural structure and B-doped of Pd/BC-2.

# **3. Conclusions**

Using the predesigned Co-BA compound as precursor, hollow boron-doped carbon has been successfully synthesized by hightemperature pyrolysis process in H2/Ar atmosphere. The special hollow structure can be formed in the pyrolysis process without other templates. High content boron atom can be welldistributed introduced into carbon lattice in the pyrolysis process because of the precursor with the predesigned Co-BA compound. This is a potential effective route to produce hollow carbon- doped nanomaterial with high boron atom content uniformly. B-doped carbon nanocage can act as an efficient electrocatalytic carrier for the stability of Pd nanoparticles. The Pd/BC-2 electrocatalysts display excellent electrocatalytic activities of the peak current density (3614.11 mAmg <sup>1</sup> ), lower Tafel slope (184.2 mVs 1 ), stability and anti-CO poisoning toward EOR in basic environment among the produced four electrocatalysts. These results illustrate the improvement on ethanol electrocatalytic oxidation performance, which can be credited to the special hollow nanocage construction features and borondoping, producing large surface area and space, more active site and stable dispersion of Pd NPs. For the above conclusion, boron-doped carbon nanocage could be looking forward to having potential application of lithium battery, supercapacitors and electrolysis of water.

# **Experimental Section**

## **Materials and Methods**

Disodium tetrachloropalladate (Na2PdCl4, 98%) and 5-boronoisophthalic acid (5-bop, 97%) were obtained from the Aladdin Co., Ltd., China. Cobalt (II) acetate tetrahydrate (99.9%) was obtained from Shanghai Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd, China. Nafion solution (5 wt %) was purchased from the Sigma-Aldrich Co., USA. Nitric acid (HNO3, 65–68%), dihydrate trisodium citrate (99.0%), isopropyl alcohol (99.7%), potassium hydroxide (KOH, 85.0%) and ethanol (EtOH, 99.7%) were purchased from the Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd., China. Commercial Pd/C was acquired from the Shanghai River Sen Electric Co., Ltd, China. Ultrapure water (18.25 MΩcm <sup>1</sup> ) was used in all experiments.

## **Preparations of Electrocatalysts**

#### *Synthesis of Co-BA Compound*

In a typical process, 5-bop (1.00 g,) was firstly dissolved in methanol solution (250.0 mL) under vigorous stirring for 2 h. The same volume Cobalt (II) acetate tetrahydrate (1.0 g) solution of methanol was added dropwise under continued stirring. After that, the mixture was furtherly stirred for about 1 h and kept undisturbed for 24 h at room temperature. The pink sediment was purified with methanol three times by centrifugation. The pink powder was collected after dried at 60°C, named Co-BA compound.

#### *Synthesis of Boron-Doped Carbon (BC) Materials*

A 0.75 g amount of Co B-MOF powder was placed in alundum boats. The temperature was first heated to 350 °C and maintained for 2 h, then was raised to 800, 900, and 1000 °C for 3 h at a heating rate of 2°Cmin <sup>1</sup> . The process was worked in a mix gas of H2/Ar (H2:5% in volume ratio) flow. The black powder was dipped in 2 M HNO3 solution for two days. After repeatedly washed with water by centrifugation and dried at 60°C, the resulting black product was collected, and named BC-1, BC-2, BC-3, respectively.

## *Synthesis of Electrocatalysts Pd/BC*

The Pd/BC catalysts were prepared according to the former report with a little modification, using BC as carbon source instead of ZGxC.[62] The catalysts are named Pd/BC-1, Pd/BC-2, Pd/BC-3, with supports BC-1, BC-2, and BC-3.

#### **Characterization Techniques**

The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were captured by a SU8010 instrument (Hitachi, Japan). X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) was carried out on a D8 Advance diffractometer (Bruker Ltd, Germany) with Cu Kα radiation and operating on 5 kV. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were recorded using a JEM-1011 instrument (Japanese Electronics Co. Ltd, Japan, 100 kV). Raman spectra were carried on a LabRam HR800 (Horiba Jobin Yvon, Japan) with 632 nm lasers. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed using a STA 449 F3 Jupiter instrument (NETZSCH, Germany) at a heating speed of 10°Cmin <sup>1</sup> under N2 flow. The N2 adsorption and desorption isotherms were recorded by the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method, and specific surface areas and pore structure of the samples were characterized by an ASAP 2020 instrument (Micromeritics, USA). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) experiments were performed by a K-Alpha instrument (ThermoFisher, USA) with monochromatic Al Kα X-ray radiation.

## **Electrochemical Test**

The electrochemical measurements were carried out with a conventional three-electrode system On a CHI 760E (Shanghai CH Instrumental Co.) electrochemical workstation. A platinum sheet was used as the aided electrodes, and the saturated calomel electrode (SCE) was applied to a reference electrode. A glassy carbon electrode (GCE) coated by a thin film of catalyst was used as the working electrode. The working electrodes were manufactured as follows: 4.0 mg carbon materials were dispersed in a 4.0 mL isopropyl alcohol, water, 0.5% Nafion mixture solution (volume ratio= 1:1:0.025, respectively) by ultrasonication. The modified electrodes were coated by 10 μL the produced catalyst ink and dried at room temperature. Hence, a 2.0 μg weight of Pd was loaded on the GCE by assuming that Pd2<sup>+</sup> is 100% reduced. The electrochemical experiments were conducted in a 1.0 M KOH with or without ethanol (EtOH, 1.0 M) solution via a 50 mVs <sup>1</sup> sweep rate at the potential range from 0.7 to +0.2 V (vs SCE). Chronoamperometry (CA) curve was recorded at 0.4 V (vs SCE). The electrolytes were blown with 99.99% nitrogen for 40 minutes before to the electrochemical testing.

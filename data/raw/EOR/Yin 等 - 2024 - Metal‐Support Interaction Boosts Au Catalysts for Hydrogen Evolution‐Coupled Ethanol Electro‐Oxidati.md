Electrochemical hydrogen and acetate cogeneration from ethanol is a promising green hydrogen production technique with low hydrogen production energy consumption and high profitability. However, the poor catalytic stability of the anodic ethanol electro-oxidation reaction (EOR) retards the device application. We adopted a metal support interaction strategy to reinforce small-sized Au active sites using cuprous sulfide supports. The Au—Cu<sub>2-x</sub>S/C showed a superior activity of

1055 mAmg<sub>Au</sub><sup>-1</sup> at 1.1 V vs. RHE and retained the high activity in the chronopotentiometric test, surpassing the Au/C catalyst. It was demonstrated that the  $Cu_{2-x}S$  support facilitated the formation of Au–OH and prevented the gold sites from aggregation, leading to high activity and stability for EOR. Finally, an electrochemical cogeneration electrolyzer assembled with the Au– $Cu_{2-x}S/C$  anodic catalyst continuously ran for over 100 hours, suggesting the device's applicability.

#### Introduction

Green hydrogen production, which is powered by renewable energy-generated electricity, encompasses a sustainable energy and resource network to supply the future society by avoiding heavy uses of fossil fuels and mitigating greenhouse gas emissions.<sup>[1]</sup> To confront the burgeoning demand for hydrogen, it is essential to develop diverse competitive green hydrogen production techniques. Water electrolysis is the primary method for green hydrogen production, but it is subjected to high energy consumption, high cost, and potential risk of explosion. [2] Alternatively, electrochemical hydrogen and chemical cogeneration (EHCC), which substitutes anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with organics electro-oxidation reactions, lowers the equilibrium potential, increases the added value of anodic products, and avoids the oxygen permeation, as compared with water electrolysis.[3] It has been demonstrated that most of the EHCC routes are financially profitable, and ethanol electro-oxidation reaction (EOR) to acetate acid coupled with hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) shows the largest market size and the highest overall profit by the simplified market and technique assessments.<sup>[4]</sup>

EOR has a lower equilibrium potential than OER, i.e., 0.1 V vs. 1.23 V, which contributes to the low energy consumption of hydrogen production for EHCC. However, multi-electron transfer reaction path, various byproducts, and poisoning/passivation intermediates (e.g., CO, CH<sub>x</sub>, oxide, etc.) retard EOR performance (activity, selectivity, and stability) in kinetics, which requires effective catalysts for the fast reaction follows the targeted paths.<sup>[5]</sup> As compared with the commonly used Pt or Pd catalysts, gold catalysts have their edges on the selectivity to acetate and the stability owing to the non-adsorption reaction mechanism. [6] Kwon et al. demonstrated that the alcohol electro-oxidation performance depended on either the nature of the substrates (i.e.,  $pK_a$ ) or the ability of the electrode to abstract H from alcoholate (i.e., formation of adsorbed Au-OH).[7] A high propensity to form surface oxide would lower the maximum permissible current density and stability. Consequently, the ability to generate surface oxidative species plays a tradeoff between the activity and the stability of the goldcatalyzed EOR, and thus, a favored reaction barrier to generate adsorbed hydroxides rather than surface oxides is highly desired for the long-term active EHCC based on the current studies.

The rational design of metal-support interfaces provides a valid way to optimize the activity and stability of the catalysts by tuning the metal-support interaction (MSI), which refers to the chemical bonding and charge transfer between catalysts and supports. By selecting appropriate supports, the electronic structure of the catalyst can be optimized to enhance the activity, and the stabilized catalytic centers can also retain the structural features (e.g., size, morphology, etc.) during the reaction to achieve long-term stability. Duan et al. adopted a

nickel hydroxide-supported gold electrocatalyst for the selective electro-oxidation of glycol to lactic acid and ethylene glycol. The Au/Ni(OH)2 interface facilitated the formation of OH on Au and improved the performance of the catalyst.[9] Xiang et al. constructed a "Card-house" structure Pt3Sn loaded NiFe-layered double hydroxide for the efficient EOR.[10] The support enhanced the activity and stability by improving the antitoxicity of Pt3Sn. Kepeniene et al. reported a microwave-assisted synthetic method to prepare a AuCeO2/C electrocatalyst for the alcohol electro-oxidation reaction.[11] The probable interaction between Au and CeO2 enhanced the electro-catalytic activity.

Cu2S is a typical functional support that shows strong interactions with noble metals, and the composites have been widely applied in electrocatalysis, photocatalysis, and biotherapy.[12] In this work, we adopted a nanosized Cu2–xS support to promote both the activity and stability of Au catalysts for EOR. A gold-nanobowl-loaded Au Cu2–xS/C catalyst with an enlarged electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) was synthesized by optimizing the synthetic parameters, e.g., loading weight, reaction temperature, etc. The Au Cu2–xS/C showed enhanced activity and stability for EOR as compared with the Au/C catalyst. Experiments demonstrated that the support accelerated the formation of Au OH via the probable charge transfer. The strong chemical bonding between gold and sulfur prevented the Au particles from aggregation and thus elevated the stability. An effective EHCC device was finally assembled using the Au Cu2–xS/C as the anodic catalyst.

#### **Results and Discussion**

As illustrated in Figure S1a, monodispersed Cu31S16 nanoparticles (NPs) (14.4�1.6 nm) were prepared by a classical wetchemical synthetic method.[12] The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern (Figure S1b) suggested that the as-obtained Cu31S16 NPs were in a hexagonal phase. Then, Au Cu2–xS heterostructures were acquired by adding HAuCl4 into the Cu31S16 NPs dispersion, as shown in Figure 1a. Figure S2 shows the ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectrum of the Au Cu2–xS catalyst, and the broadband absorption in the visible and near-infrared region was possibly due to the localized surface plasmon resonances, suggesting the potential photocoupling properties. As shown in Figure 1b, the catalyst, i. e., Au Cu2–xS/C, was obtained by carbon-loading and annealing under an air atmosphere for further characterization and electrochemical measurements. In this recipe, the key synthetic parameters, i. e., reaction temperature and loading weight, were optimized to achieve high utilization of Au, as shown in Figure 1a–1b and Figure S3. The as-obtained Au Cu2–xS NPs were named "Au Cu2–xS Y Z", where Y represented the Au loading weight (10 for 10%, 20 for 20%, and 30 for 30%), Z represented the reaction temperature (40 for 40°C, 60 for 60°C, 80 for 80°C, 100 for 100 °C, and 120 for 120°C).

Ethanol electro-oxidation reaction (EOR) performance evaluation was conducted in a typical three-electrode system in advance to find the optimal synthetic conditions and the representative references. A Au/C catalyst was also prepared via a similar wet-chemical method. Figure S4 shows the trans-

mission electron microscopy (TEM) image of the Au/C catalyst with an average size of 9.0 nm. The catalyst loading was kept the same in the EOR tests. Figure S5 shows the polarization curve of Cu2S/C in the ethanol solution, suggesting that the support was inactive in below 1.4 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). The tiny oxidation peaks might be attributed to the oxidation of Cu2S, and the rising curve above 1.4 V might result fromOER. Figure 2a shows the polarization curves of Au Cu2–xS/C with different reaction temperatures in the 1.0 mol L <sup>1</sup> ethanol and 1.0 mol L <sup>1</sup> KOH electrolyte, and the activity sequence is as follows: Au Cu2–xS–20–80/C*>* Au Cu2–xS–20–100/C*>*Au Cu2–xS–20–60/C�Au Cu2–xS–20– 120/C*>*Au/C*>*Au Cu2–xS–20–40/C. Similarly, Figure 2b shows the polarization curves of Au Cu2–xS/C with different gold loadings in the 1.0 mol L <sup>1</sup> ethanol and 1.0 mol L <sup>1</sup> KOH electrolyte, and the activity sequence is as follows: Au Cu2–xS–20–80/ C*>*Au Cu2–xS–30–80/C*>*Au Cu2–xS–10–80/C*>*Au/C. The activity evaluation indicated that 20% of gold loading and the

reaction temperature of 80°C were the optimal synthetic parameters, i.e., Au Cu2–xS–20–80/C was the optimal catalyst. The Au Cu2–xS catalysts could be divided into three categories according to the TEM images: Au Cu2–xS–20–40 (Figure S3a) and Au Cu2–xS–10–80 (Figure S3i) were single particle-loaded heterostructures; Au Cu2–xS–20–60 (Figure S3c), Au Cu2–xS–20– 80 (Figure 1a), and Au Cu2–xS–20–100 (Figure S3e) were multiple particles-loaded heterostructures; segregated Au particles were observed in Au Cu2–xS–20–120 (Figure S3g) and Au Cu2–xS–30–80 (Figure S3k). Hence, Au Cu2–xS–20–40, Au Cu2–xS–20–120, Au Cu2–xS–10–80, and Au Cu2–xS–30–80 were selected as the references for the in-depth mechanism study.

Figure 1c shows the XRD pattern of the Au Cu2–xS/C. The XRD pattern shows the characteristic diffraction peaks of gold at the 2θ angle of 38.1°, 44.1°, 64.8°, and 77.4° (JCPDS No. 01– 1172), confirming the formation of gold NPs in the Au Cu2–xS heterostructures. The other diffraction peaks contributed from the orthorhombic Cu2S support (JCPDS No. 02–1294) were quite different from the Cu31S16 NP precursors (Figure S1b, JCPDS No. 34–0660), suggesting that the loading of gold altered the Cu31S16 support structure via the probable redox and ionexchange reactions. Figure 1d shows the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image of the Au Cu2–xS-20-80/C. The high contrast areas show the characteristic lattice fringe of Au (111) planes (0.23 nm), and the low contrast areas show that of Cu2S (0.27 nm), suggesting the formation of the Au Cu2–xS/C heterostructures. High-angle annular dark field scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM) and the corresponding energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS) scanning were adopted to confirm the heterostructure. Figure 1e–1f show the HAADF-STEM image, EDS line-scan profile, and EDS mapping profiles of the Au Cu2–xS–20–80/C. Both the high contrast areas in the STEM image and the segregated Au signals in the EDS line-scan and mapping profiles confirmed that the multiple small-sized Au particles on the Cu2–xS support (Figure 1a) converted into a thin Au nanobowl on the Cu2–xS surface (Figure 1b, 1e, and S6). As shown in Figure S6, the average size of the Au nanobowl was 2.8 nm in thickness and 5.5 nm in width, suggesting the optimal size of Au amongst the Au Cu2–xS/C samples. It was deduced that the multiple gold particles coalesced into single nanobowl during the annealing post-treatment procedures, and the strong interaction between Cu2–xS and Au retained the high dispersity of Au on the Cu2–xS surface.

ECSAs, estimated by the reduction peaks of AuO, were adopted to evaluate the dispersity of Au.[13] As shown in Figure S7 and Table S1, the optimal synthetic conditions, i. e., 80°C and 20% of Au loading weight, contributed to the highest ECSA of 8.3 m2g <sup>1</sup> Au for the Au Cu2–xS/C catalysts. Inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) results showed that the actual Au loading amounts were 6%, 21%, and 21% for the Au Cu2–xS/C catalysts prepared at 40°C, 80°C, and 120°C, respectively, suggesting the incomplete reduction of Au(III) in the 30 mins' reaction at 40°C. The HAADF-STEM images of the two references in Figure S8 confirmed the probable origins of the low ECSAs. As shown in Figure S8a, the initial-reacted gold species might diffuse into the lattice of the Cu2–xS support and not contribute to the ECSA, leading to the lowest ECSA for the Au Cu2–xS–20–40/C. Large and segregated Au NPs with large sizes were formed at 120°C (Figure S3h and S8b), resulting in the low ECSA of the Au Cu2–xS–20–120/C. Similar explanations could be made for the Au Cu2–xS–10–80/C and Au Cu2–xS–30–80/C. It also indicated that the gold loading capacity of the Cu2–xS was estimated to be 20%. The aforementioned high-resolution characterization results suggested the high dispersity of Au for the Au Cu2–xS–20–80/C. The ECSA values in Table S1 also suggested that the specific surface area of Au reached the plateau at 20%, and further increment of Au loadings would lead to the loss of the Au utilization. The high ECSA was one of the probable reasons for the superior EOR activity of the Au Cu2–xS–20–80/C. Hence, with the fine control of synthetic parameters, a heterostructured Au Cu2–xS/C catalyst with a high Au dispersity was prepared via the facile synthetic method.

To further reveal the reinforcement mechanism, we used the mass activity and specific activity at 1.1 V vs. RHE (between the onset potential and peak potential) as the activity evaluation criteria for EOR, as shown in Figure 2c and Table S1. As shown in Figure 2a and 2b, the catalysts shared similar EOR onset potentials close to 0.8 V vs. RHE, which were determined by the p*K*a value of the alcohol substrates and correlated to the deprotonation for the first step of gold-catalyzed EOR as demonstrated by Kwon et al.[7] As illustrated in Figure 2c, the Au Cu2–xS–20–80/C exhibited the highest mass activity of 1055 mAmgAu <sup>1</sup> at 1.1 V amongst all the tested samples. For the ECSA-normalized specific activity, the activity of the Au Cu2–xS/ C catalysts prepared at different temperatures followed the sequence as Au Cu2–xS–20–40/C*>*Au Cu2–xS–20–80/C*>* Au Cu2–xS–20–120/C*>*Au/C, and the activity of the Au Cu2–xS/

C catalysts prepared with different Au loadings followed the sequence as Au Cu2–xS–10–80/C*>*Au Cu2-xS-20-80/C*>* Au Cu2–xS–30–80/C*>*Au/C. The sequence of the specific activity was quite different from that of the mass activity, suggesting that ECSA played a key role in the EOR overall activity. The difference in the specific activity was attributed to the intrinsic activity difference from the different active sites. Given that the Au Cu2–xS/C catalysts consisted of two types of Au sites, i. e., the Au site and the Au Cu2–xS interfacial site, the size of the Au particle increased with the increment of reaction temperature according to the structural characterizations, leading to the decreased proportion of the Au Cu2–xS interfacial sites. Hence, the specific activity sequence indicated that the Au Cu2–xS interfacial site probably possessed a higher EOR activity than the Au site. Because the mass activity is determined by both the specific activity and the ECSA, the Au Cu2–xS–20–80/C showed the highest mass activity due to the highest ECSA and the high proportion of the Au Cu2–xS interfacial sites. However, the Au Cu2–xS–20–40/C and Au Cu2–xS–10–80/C with higher specific activity showed lower mass activity due to the low ECSA. As shown in Figure 2b, 2c, and Table S1, the EOR activity sequence of the Au Cu2–xS/C catalysts with different Au loadings indicated a similar rule: the Au Cu2–xS–10–80/C with the lowest loading showed the highest specific activity due to the highest proportion of the Au Cu2–xS interfacial site; the limited loading capacity and the low proportion of the Au Cu2–xS interfacial site for the Au Cu2–xS–20–120/C and Au Cu2–xS–30–80/C contributed to the inferior mass activity than the Au Cu2–xS–20–80/C. Hence, the Au Cu2–xS–20–80/C exhibited the highest mass activity in all the Au Cu2–xS/C catalysts owing to the highest ECSA and the superior activity of the Au Cu2–xS interfacial site.

To get insight into the high EOR activity of the Au Cu2–xS interfacial site, we conducted X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) on the four catalysts. Figure 3a shows the corresponding Au 4f core-level spectra. For the Au Cu2–xS/C catalysts, the Au 4f7/2 peak centered at 84.6 eV, and the Au 4f5/2 peak centered at 88.3 eV, which could be assigned to the Au(I) species.[14] For the Au/C reference, the Au 4f peaks shifted to the low binding energy by ca. 0.2 eV, indicating that the Au/C catalyst consisted of Au (0) and Au (I). The Au 4f spectra suggested the probable facilitated charge transfer from Au to the Cu2–xS supports for the Au Cu2–xS/C catalysts. The positively charged interfacial Au sites probably facilitated the formation of Au OH, leading to the superior EOR activity of the Au Cu2–xS/C catalysts than the Au/C catalyst.[15] For the Cu 2p spectra in Figure 3b, the peaks at 932.7 were assigned to the Cu 2p3/2, while the 952.6 were assigned to the Cu 2p1/2. No significant peak shift was observed for the Cu 2p spectra of the three Au Cu2–xS/C catalysts, and neither for the Au 4f spectra, suggesting a similar surface chemical status for the Au Cu2–xS/C catalysts.

Electrochemical in situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) experiments were then performed to monitor the adsorbed surface species. As shown in Figure S9, a potential step method with time durations of 54.4 s was applied to acquire the in situ FTIR spectra from 0.68 to 1.48 V vs. RHE. Figure 3c–d show the in situ FTIR spectra of the Au/C and

Au Cu2–xS/C toward EOR. The characteristic bands in the alkaline EOR were observed in the spectra as in the previous reports.[16] The positive bands at 1410 and 1520 (1540) cm <sup>1</sup> were ascribed to the FTIR bands of acetate ions, while there were no significant bands of CO3 <sup>2</sup> and CO2 at 1390 and 2430 cm <sup>1</sup> respectively, suggesting that both the gold catalysts followed a general partial oxidation reaction path to acetaldehyde or acetate without the cleavage of C C bonds. The bands of acetate ions appeared at 0.88 V for the Au/C (Figure 3c) and 0.78 V for the Au Cu2–xS/C (Figure 3d), which was consistent with the onset potential of the polarization curves. The peak positions of the acetate ions were kept unchanged with the variation of applied potentials, indicating a weak interaction between the acetate product and the catalysts. The two bands showed the highest intensities at about 1.38 V, consistent with the potential of the maximum permissible current density in Figure S9. It was also indicated that the partial oxidation path dominated the overall electrochemical reaction. An extra band at 3720 cm <sup>1</sup> appeared from 0.98 V, which might be attributed to the formation of surface hydroxide, confirming the formation of Au OH.

Figure 4a shows the stability tests using chronopotentiometry at the current density of 200 mAmgAu <sup>1</sup> . The applied potential was less than 1.0 V vs. RHE during the one-hour test for the Au Cu2–xS/C, whereas the Au/C deactivated at 50 mins, demonstrating that the Cu2–xS enhanced the catalytic stability of gold for EOR. As shown in Figure 4b–c, the TEM images of the catalysts after the stability tests also revealed that the Au/C catalyst aggregated severely from 9.0 to 13.8 nm while the Cu2–xS support maintained the dispersity of gold during the reaction. The average size of Au Cu2–xS/C reduced from 16.3 to 11.9 nm, probably due to the recrystallization of the Cu2–xS

support during the reaction, and there was no obvious Au agglomeration in Figure 4c. Hence, the Au Cu2–xS/C outperformed the Au/C on both activity and stability owing to the MSI between Au and Cu2–xS.

Hence, the experiments mentioned above demonstrated that the charge transfer from Au to Cu2–xS facilitated the formation of Au OH, resulting in the activity enhancement of the Au Cu2–xS site. Strong chemical bonding between Au and Cu2–xS ensured the high dispersity of Au in the synthesis and the catalysis, contributing to the high ECSA and robust stability. Additionally, a large Cu2–xS support with an average size of 15.4 nm (named L Cu2–xS) was prepared by prolonging the reaction time, as shown in Figure S10a. No segregated Au particles were observed for the Au L Cu2–xS–20–80/C and Au L Cu2–xS–30–80/C, as shown in Figure S10b and 10c. The EOR polarization curves of the Au L Cu2–xS–20–80/C and Au L Cu2–xS–30–80/C (Figure S10d) almost overlapped and exhibited similar mass activity values of 1286 and 1301 mAmgAu <sup>1</sup> respectively, surpassing that of the Au Cu2–xS– 20–80/C. The high mass activity of the large-sized support probably originated from the high loading capacity of the L Cu2–xS support. Further optimizations could be conducted by the design of the Cu2–xS support.

A flow-cell electrolyzer was finally assembled using the Au Cu2–xS–20–80/C as the anodic catalyst to demonstrate the device's applicability for EHCC. As illustrated in Figure 5a, a membrane-less flow-cell configuration was adopted in the electrolyzer setup: commercial 20 wt.% Pt/C ink was sprayed onto the carbon paper as the cathode; the Au Cu2–xS/C ink was sprayed onto the carbon paper as the anode; the electrolyte containing 1 M KOH and 1 M ethanol was kept at 50°C using a water bath and cycled through the chambers using a peristaltic

pump. As shown in Figure 5b, the electrolyzer displayed a current density of 38 mAcm <sup>2</sup> at the voltage of 1.2 V, demonstrating the feasibility of EOR-coupled electrochemical hydrogen production operated at a lower applied potential than the water electrolyzer. As shown in Figure 5c, the electrolyzer continuously ran at the current density of *>*10 mAcm <sup>2</sup> in the 100-hour stability test, surpassing the device stability of the AuCu catalyst in our previous report.[4]

## **Conclusions**

In sum, we adopted a MSI strategy to stabilize gold-loaded EOR nanocatalysts by constructing the Au Cu2–xS heterostructure for application in EHCC devices. By optimizing the synthetic parameters, the Au Cu2–xS heterostructure with a loading weight of 20%, which was the Cu2–xS NP loaded with Au nanobowls, showed the highest ECSA and mass activity toward EOR. Further characterizations suggested that the positively charged Cu2–xS-supported Au sites facilitated the formation of Au OH, leading to superior EOR activity for the Au Cu2–xS catalysts. In situ FTIR experiments demonstrated the high selectivity to acetate and confirmed the formation of Au OH species. The stability tests also confirmed the Cu2–xS support prevented the gold sites from aggregation and retained the EOR activity in the prolonged reaction time, outperforming the Au/C reference. An EHCC electrolyzer equipped with the Au Cu2–xS catalysts, which integrated the cathodic HER with the anodic EOR, retained a current density of *>*10 mAcm <sup>2</sup> at the applied voltage of 1.2 V in the 100-hour operation.

R.) were purchased from Shanghai Aladdin Biochemical Technology Co., Ltd. High-purity nitrogen and hydrogen were purchased from Air Liquide. Carbon cloth (HCP-330 N) was purchased from Shanghai Hesen Electrical Co., Ltd. The water used in all experiments was deionized (18.2 MΩ· cm, Millipore). All reagents were used as received without further purification.

*Synthesis of Cu31S16 NPs.* 160 mg of anhydrous copper acetate, 16 mL of dodecanethiol, and 8 mL of dodecane were added to a 50 mL three-necked flask. N2 was purged into the flask at room temperature for 10 min. Then, the flask was heated to 230 °C and kept for 20 min under the protection of N2 atmosphere. After cooling down to room temperature, the product was precipitated by adding ethanol, and the precipitates were washed three times using the mixture of ethanol and cyclohexane. At last, the asobtained Cu31S16 NPs were dispersed in cyclohexane for further use.

*Synthesis of Au Cu2*–*xS NPs.* 0.2 mL of the cyclohexane solution containing the as-prepared Cu31S16 NPs (approximately 25 mg) was mixed with 8 mL of oleylamine in a three-necked flask. 25 mg of HAuCl4 dissolved in ethylene glycol was added into the solution and kept at 80°C for 30 mins under the protection of N2 atmosphere. After the reaction, the product was precipitated by

adding ethanol, washed three times using the mixture of ethanol and cyclohexane, and dispersed in cyclohexane for further use.

*Carbon support loading.* 20 mg of carbon black (Vulcan XC-72, Cabot) was dispersed in 150 mL of cyclohexane and sonicated for 20 min. Then, the cyclohexane solution of Au Cu2–xS NPs was added dropwise to the carbon dispersion. The mixture was sonicated for 30 min and magnetically stirred overnight. The loaded catalyst was separated by centrifugation and washed with ethanol. After drying at 60°C, the catalyst powder was calcinated at 180 °C for 3 hours under an air atmosphere to remove the capping agents. The samples after carbon support loading were named "Au Cu2–xS/ C".

*Physical Characterizations.* The morphology of the catalysts was characterized by TEM using a Hitachi HT7700 with an accelerating voltage of 100 kV and a maximum magnification of 200 K. HRTEM and EDS were conducted on a JEOL JEM-2010F transmission electron microscope. The HRTEM samples were prepared by loading the catalysts on ultra-thin Ni grids. The crystalline structures were characterized by XRD using a 2500 VB2+PC diffractometer equipped with Cu Kα radiation (λ=0.154 nm) operating at 40 kV and 40 mA, and the diffraction angle of the test samples ranged from 30 to 80°. The scanning rate was 10° min <sup>1</sup> . The UV-Vis characterization was conducted on a Shimadzu UV-3600i Plus spectrophotometer. The XPS spectra of the catalysts were recorded on a Thermo Fisher ESCALAB 250Xi XPS system with a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source. The binding energies were calibrated to the C 1s at 284.8 eV. The elemental composition analyses were conducted by a Thermo-Fisher ICAP 6300 ICP-OES instrument.

*Electrochemical Measurements.* The electrochemical performance tests were carried out in a three-electrode system. The catalyst ink was prepared by dispersing 2 mg of the catalysts into a mixture containing 250 μL of water, 10 μL of Nafion solution (5%, DuPont), and 740 μL of isopropanol under ultrasonic treatment. The working electrode was prepared by dropping the catalyst ink solution onto a glassy carbon rotating disk electrode (RDE), ensuring that a uniform catalyst film with catalyst loading of 0.1 mgcm <sup>2</sup> formed on the RDE. A carbon rod was used as the counter electrode, and a saturated calomel electrode was used as the reference electrode. The reference electrode was calibrated before each test using the RHE. All the potentials were converted to RHE in this work. Both the RDE system and the liquid-flow electrolytic cell were measured using electrochemical workstations (CHI 760, CH Instruments Ins.). The EOR evaluations were conducted in the alkaline electrolyte containing 1 M of KOH and 1 M of ethanol. Before the tests, N2 was purged into the solution to saturation for 30 mins. The cyclic voltammetry curves were scanned at a sweep speed of 50 mVs <sup>1</sup> at 1600 rpm. The steady positive-scanning polarization curves were used to compare the activity. Stability tests were conducted using chronopotentiometry. The ECSA was evaluated by the reduction peak of AuO as follows:

$$ECSA(cm^2 mg^{-1}_{Au}) = Q/(m \times C)$$
(1)

where *Q* is the electric quantity of the AuO reduction peak at ca. 1.1 V vs. RHE, *C* is the specific electric quantity constant of the AuO reduction, i. e., 390 μCcm <sup>2</sup> , and *m* is the mass of gold in the catalysts.

*Electrochemical in situ FTIR experiments.* The FTIR experiments were conducted on the Nicolet iS50 IR spectrometer equipped with an MCT detector cooled with liquid nitrogen. An *in situ* FTIR thin-layer cell with a calcium fluoride window was applied in the test. The working electrode was a catalyst-coated glassy carbon electrode against the calcium fluoride window. A Pt wire and a saturated calomel electrode were used as the counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively. The electrolyte is 1 M KOH with 1 M ethanol. The reference spectrum was collected at 0.58 V vs. RHE. The *in situ* EC-IR spectra under a series of potentials were acquired using a potential step method. To subtract the signals from the background, the spectrum at each potential was normalized by the reference spectrum as follows:

Absorbance 
$$(E_S^i) = -\log(R(E_S^i)/R(E_R))$$
 (2)

*R*(*E*R) and *R*(*E*<sup>S</sup> ) were the single beam spectra at reference potential and tested potential, respectively.

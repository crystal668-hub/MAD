FeCoNilrPtPd/NCNT exhibits 3.4- and 1.6-fold higher levels of mass activity than does commercial Pt/C in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR), respectively.

The exploitation of sustainable energy sources is recognized as the most effective method to mitigate the energy crisis and environmental pollution.<sup>1,2</sup> Direct alcohol fuel cells (DAFCs) constitute one of the supplements for hydrogen-based polymer electrolyte fuel cells (PEMFCs).<sup>3,4</sup> The utilizations of methanol and ethanol as fuel are safer and less expensive than is the utilization of hydrogen, which requires a hydrogen tank for storage. When compared to methanol, ethanol has its typical merits of lower toxicity and fuel crossover over the Nafion membrane to reduce the cell voltage.  $^{5,6}$  However, the sluggish ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR), a 12e<sup>-</sup> reaction, and poisoning by the generated CO impede the industrialization of direct ethanol fuel cells (DEFCs).7,8 Due to the high C-C bond cleavage energy, the faradaic efficiency of the conversion of ethanol to CO<sub>2</sub> product is below 8%;<sup>9,10</sup> therefore, development of a high-performance EOR electrocatalyst is highly desirable. More importantly, as mentioned above, CO is normally generated during the EOR via incomplete oxidation and it will strongly adsorb onto the Pt atoms, diminishing their EOR activity. 11,12 The anti-CO-poisoning property of an EOR electrocatalyst should also be seriously considered.

Enhancing CO tolerance and activity can be achieved by introducing a secondary active center to Pt.13,14 Similar to the MOR electrocatalyst, alloying Ru atom or construction of active site with good water dissociation nearby Pt atoms is the effective method to alleviate CO poisoning. 15,16 However, the utilization of Ru faces the problem of rapid electrochemical dissolution; thus, how to stabilize Ru in the electrocatalyst becomes the key point for such EOR electrocatalysts. 17,18 Many efficient strategies have been reported for stabilizing Ru, like alloying and deploying confinement effects. 19-22 The catalytic activity of Pt is regulated by its electronic configuration, and a high-performance high-entropy alloy (HEA) has recently been reported to be used for various electrocatalyses via the adjustments in its morphology and elemental composition. 23-27 Similar to EOR catalysts, a robust HER electrocatalyst can be achieved by weakening the otherwise strong binding between active sites and hydrogen atoms to reach a balance point. 28,29 In this regard, using an HEA is also suitable for achieving efficient HER catalysis. However, enveloping HEA with carbon or other materials to improve its stability has not yet been reported to the best of our knowledge.

Thus, in this work, we have synthesized HEA nanoparticles with 6 elements, namely Fe, Co, Ni, Pd, Pt, and Ir, and further embedded them into nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (NCNT) via a method involving high-temperature pyrolysis. In a TEM analysis, it was found that Fe, Co, Ni, Pd, Pt and Ir contributed to the composition of the HEA nanoparticles and were confined by the NCNT. According to an EOR test, FeCo-NiIrPtPd/NCNT showed an impressive catalytic activity, 1.6-fold higher than that of commercial Pt/C, due to a better CO tolerance as evidenced by the results of a CO stripping voltammetry test; importantly, a stable EOR performance was achieved for FeCoNiIrPtPd/NCNT over the course of 1000 cycles, ascribed to the protection provided by the NCNT. Moreover, the HER performance of FeCoNiIrPtPd/NCNT was better than that of Pt/C, requiring 20 mV and 30 mV, respectively, of overpotential to attain a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. The boosted HER activity originated from the lattice distortion in the HEA nanoparticle.

Similarly, the NCNT confinement contributed to structural stability during the HER.

As shown in Fig. 1a, the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of FeCoNiIrPtPd/NCNT exhibited distinct dominant diffraction peaks at 43.7°, 50.8° and 74.7°, differing from the patterns for metallic Pt (JCPDS: 01-1190), Ir (JCPDS: 01-1216), Co (JCPDS: 01-1255), Ni (JCPDS: 01-1260) and Pd (JCPDS: 65-6174). The diffraction peaks did resemble those of metallic Fe (ICPDS: 52-0513) and were observed to be slightly positively shifted relative to those of Pd, Pd, Ir and Fe, but negatively shifted compared to those of Co and Ni. Thus, the strain effect was distinctly observed in high entropy alloys (HEAs). Moreover, the diffraction peaks were assigned to (111), (200) and (220) crystal planes. A moderately strong peak was also observed at 26°, which was from the C (002) facet of the NCNT. Weaker diffraction peaks appeared with the dominant peaks, indicative of lattice mismatch in the HEA nanoparticles.30 The lattice mismatch was estimated, using the equation  $\varepsilon = \frac{\Delta d}{d} = -\Delta \theta \frac{\cos \theta B}{\sin \theta B}$ , to be 0.37%, 0.33% and 0.04% for the three dominant diffraction peaks, respectively.

As shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†), the C 1s region of the X-ray photoelectron spectrum (XPS) of FeCoNiIrPtPd/NCNT showed a peak centered at 284.5 eV. As shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†), an N 1s signal was clearly observed, suggesting the successful doping of nitrogen atoms from dicyandiamide into the CNT. Moreover, the nitrogen content was 3.3 wt% in FeCoNiIrPtPd/NCNT based on a quantitative analysis of the XPS data. The N 1s signal was fitted by peaks at 395.3 eV, 396.5 eV, 397.9 eV and 399.9 eV, attributed to pyridinic N, pyrrolic N, graphitic N and oxidized N, respectively. As shown in Fig. 1b, the fitting of the signal in the Fe 2p region of the spectrum indicated the co-existence of Fe<sup>2+</sup> and Fe<sup>0</sup> species in the HEAs.<sup>31</sup> The signals in the Co region of the spectrum were also deconvoluted, specifically fitted by peaks at 797.5 eV, 795.4 eV, 781.4 eV and 779.7 eV, corresponding to  $\text{Co}^{2+} 2p_{1/2}$ ,  $\text{Co}^{0} 2p_{1/2}$ ,  $\text{Co}^{2+} 2p_{3/2}$  and  $\text{Co}^{0}$ 2p<sub>3/2</sub> (Fig. 1c).<sup>32</sup> The Ni 2p signals were fitted by peaks at 853.5 eV, 855.3 eV, 870.1 eV and 872.7 eV, attributed to  $Ni^0$   $2p_{3/2}$ ,  $Ni^{2+}$  $2p_{3/2},\,Ni^0$   $2p_{1/2}$  and  $Ni^{2+}$   $2p_{1/2}$  (Fig. 1d).  $^{33}$  That is, oxidized Ni was,

not surprisingly, indicated to have been present in in the HEAs. Similarly, a high-valence state of Ir was observed stemming from deconvoluting the signals in the Ir 4f region to peaks at 63.8 eV, 63.1 eV, 60.9 eV and 60.4 eV, attributed to  $Ir^{3+} 4f_{5/2}$ ,  $Ir^{0} 4f_{5/2}$ ,  $Ir^{3+} 4f_{7/2}$ and Ir<sup>0</sup> 4f<sub>7/2</sub>, shown in Fig. 1e.<sup>34</sup> Analysis of the Pt 4f region of the spectrum, displayed in Fig. 1f, showed peaks at 79.6 eV, 78.2 eV, 77.1 eV and 75.7 eV, attributed to  $Pt^{2+} 4f_{5/2}$ ,  $Pt^{0} 4f_{5/2}$ ,  $Pt^{2+} 4f_{7/2}$  and  $Pt^{0}$  $4f_{7/2}$ . As shown in Fig. 1g, deconvolution of the data in the Pd 3d region yielded peaks at 347.4 eV, 343.9 eV, 341.1 eV and 336.3 eV, attributed to  $Pd^{2+} 3d_{3/2}$ ,  $Pd^{0} 3d_{3/2}$ ,  $Pd^{2+} 3d_{5/2}$  and  $Pd^{0} 3d_{5/2}$ . The oxidation states of all six metal atoms were due to their different electronegativities (Fe: 1.83; Co: 1.88; Ni: 1.91; Ir: 2.20; Pt: 2.28; Pd: 2.20); moreover, the donated electrons were transferred to the oxygen, nitrogen and carbon atoms at the metal-NCNT heterointerface.

As displayed in Fig. S3 (ESI†), Raman spectroscopy performed on FeCoNiIrPtPd/NCNT showed a distinct peak at 1365 cm<sup>-1</sup>, demonstrating defect sites on the NCNT due to the oxygen and nitrogen hetero-dopants. Additionally, the N2 isothermal curves acquired, shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†), indicated a specific surface area for FeCoNiIrPtPd/NCNT (47.2 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>) decreased by 73% compared to that of bare NCNT (175 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>), attributed to the introduction of HEA nanoparticles. The pore size was 3.6 nm for FeCoNiIrPtPd/NCNT, which was favorable for the diffusion of reactants and subsequent product formation during electrocatalysis. Based on the ICP-MS test that was performed, 5.2 wt%, 4.9 wt%, 3.9 wt%, 4.5 wt%, 4.1 wt% and 3.3 wt% of FeCoNiIrPtPd/ NCNT consisted of Fe, Co, Ni, Ir, Pt and Pd, respectively.

The NCNT sample examined showed the expected nanotube diameter of 400 nm (Fig. S5, ESI†). The FeCoNiIrPtPd/NCNT material studied showed a diameter calculated to be 500 nm for its nanotube structure (Fig. S6, ESI† and Fig. 2a), with this increased diameter due to the presence of Fe, Co and Ni contributing to the formation of its NCNT. Additionally, as shown in Fig. 2b, the HEA nanoparticle was enveloped by NCNT, and the HR-TEM image acquired (Fig. 2c) showed a vivid lattice spacing of 0.21 nm originating from the (111) facet, indicating a face-centered cubic (fcc) structure. The C, N and O elements were well dispersed over the entire architecture; in addition, Fe, Co, Ni, Ir, Pt and Pd were enriched in the HEA nanoparticle according to an EDS mapping test (Fig. 2d).

The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) for FeCoNiIrPtPd/ NCNT in 0.5 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> electrolyte was characterized. As shown in Fig. 3a, superior HER activity was observed for FeCoNiIrPtPd/NCNT, needing only 20 mV of overpotential to attain a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, which was better than the commercial Pt/C (30 mV overpotential for 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>). FeCoNi/NCNT required 135 mV of overpotential to attain 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> and NCNT showed inconspicuous HER activity, indicating that the superior HER performance was due to the presence of the noble metals Ir, Pt and Pd. Due to the low levels of contribution of the Fe, Co and Ni elements to the catalytic activity, the mass activity was calculated based on the dosage of the noble metals (Ir, Pt, Pd). As shown in Fig. 3b, at -0.05 V vs. RHE, the mass activity reached 26.1 A mg<sub>noble metal</sub><sup>-1</sup> for FeCoNiIrPtPd/NCNT, which was 3.4 times higher than that for commercial Pt/C. To quantitatively analyze the active sites, doublelayer capacitance  $(C_{\rm dl})$  was evaluated from cyclic voltammetry curves

(Fig. S7, ESI $^{\dagger}$ ). The  $C_{\rm dl}$  value reached 52.2 mF cm $^{-2}$  for FeCoNiIrPtPd/NCNT, which was 1.6-fold higher than that for Pt/C (33.6 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>). Additionally, compared to the commercial Pt/C, more active sites were found for FeCoNiIrPtPd/NCNT and its specific activity was also better (Fig. S8, ESI†), illustrating a higher HER catalytic activity due to the adjusted electronic configurations.<sup>38</sup> Besides, as shown in Fig. S9 (ESI†), the charge-transfer resistance  $(R_{\rm ct})$  was 9  $\Omega$  for FeCoNiIrPtPd/NCNT, lower than that for Pt/C and hence contributing to a better HER performance. Tafel slopes for FeCoNiIrPtPd/NCNT and Pt/C were determined from the plots in Fig. 3c to be 27.7 mV dec<sup>-1</sup> and 30.9 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>, respectively, indicative of faster kinetics under HER conditions for FeCo-NiIrPtPd/NCNT. 39,40 As shown in Fig. 3d, the overpotential for Pt/C at 50 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> increased from 73 mV to 141 mV over the course of 2000 cycles, indicative of the inferior stability of Pt/C, attributed to the loss of active sites (Fig. S10, ESI†). In contrast, for FeCoNiIrPtPd/NCNT, due to the confinement effect, the  $C_{d1}$

(Fig. S11, ESI $^{\dagger}$ ) associated with  $R_{\rm ct}$  (Fig. S12, ESI $^{\dagger}$ ) showed only a slight change over the course of 10 000 cycles; thereby, a stable HER performance was achieved for FeCoNiIrPtPd/NCNT as shown in Fig. 3e. Moreover, as shown in Fig. S13 (ESI $^{\dagger}$ ), the Tafel slope of FeCoNiIrPtPd/NCNT was also similar to the initial value, highlighting the exceptional stability. Additionally, the i-t test conducted, shown in Fig. 3f, provided evidence for the high stability of FeCoNiIrPtPd/NCNT and lower stability of Pt/C.

As shown in Fig. 4a, cyclic voltammetry curves were recorded for FeCoNiIrPtPd/NCNT and Pt/C. The ECSA values calculated from the hydrogen adsorption peaks were 105.1 m<sup>2</sup> g<sub>Pt</sub><sup>-1</sup> and 89.6 m<sup>2</sup> g<sub>Pt</sub><sup>-1</sup> for FeCoNiIrPtPd/NCNT and Pt/C, respectively. Moreover, the potential for the cathodic peak of FeCoNiIrPtPd/ NCNT was 0.63 V vs. RHE, which was negatively shifted relative to that of Pt/C (0.70 V vs. RHE), illustrating the better capability of FeCoNiIrPtPd/NCNT for water dissociation, which is favorable for the elimination of CO poisoning during ethanol oxidation via Pt(OH)<sub>ads</sub> intermediates. 41,42 As shown in Fig. 4b, the EOR performance was estimated and two oxidation peaks were observed, representing the EOR (forward peak,  $I_{\rm f}$ ) and CO oxidation (backward peak,  $I_{\rm b}$ ) peak, respectively. <sup>14,43</sup> Notably, the mass activity reached  $0.91~\mathrm{A~mg_{noble~metal}}^{-1}$  for FeCoNiIrPtPd/NCNT, 1.6 times higher than that for commercial Pt/C (0.58 A mg<sub>Pt</sub><sup>-1</sup>). NCNT and FeCoNi/NCNT exhibited an ignorable EOR performance, underscoring the robust EOR activity that originated from the presence of Ir, Pt and Pd (Fig. S14, ESI†). In addition, FeCoNiIrPtPd/NCNT outperformed FePt/ NCNT with regards to EOR activity, which also highlighted the strain effect in FeCoNiIrPtPd nanoparticles having enhanced the catalytic performance. In addition, the  $I_f/I_b$  ratio was calculated to be 1.8 for FeCoNiIrPtPd/NCNT, which was larger than that of Pt/C (1.2) suggesting a better CO anti-poisoning capability, in accordance with the CV analysis.44 Additionally, as shown in Fig. S15 (ESI†), the specific activities of FeCoNiIrPtPd/NCNT and Pt/C were measured to be 0.08 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> and 0.06 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, respectively, revealing a higher catalytic activity of FeCoNiIrPtPd/NCNT towards the EOR. To confirm the apparent superiority of the CO tolerance of FeCoNiIrPtPd/ NCNT, a CO stripping voltammetry curve was recorded as shown in Fig. 4c. The CO oxidation peak of FeCoNiIrPtPd/NCNT was observed to be located at 0.86 V vs. RHE, with this value negatively shifted by 46 mV relative to that for Pt/C, indicating that the adsorbed CO was

easily to be oxidized on FeCoNiIrPtPd/NCNT, due to the high water dissociation capability caused by Ir atoms. 45 The CO oxidation peak of FePt/NCNT was observed to be located at 0.865 V vs. RHE, suggesting that the presence of Ir and Pd was beneficial for enhancing CO tolerance. The strain effect in the tested HEA nanoparticles contributed to the modulation of their electronic configurations; therefore, the strength of the binding between Pt and CO was also changed, as proved using a CO stripping voltammetry test. Due to a better CO tolerance, the EOR performance of FeCoNiIrPtPd/NCNT was enhanced. As shown in Fig. S16 (ESI†), EOR curves with different scan rates were recorded. As plotted in Fig. 4d, a linear relationship was noted for peak current density vs. scan rate<sup>1/2</sup>, suggesting that the diffusion of reactant and product controlled the EOR catalysis. 16,46 As shown in Fig. 4e, the EOR as well as  $I_f/I_b$  ratio showed ignorable degradation over the course of 1000 cycles, ascribed to the confinement effect induced by the NCNT; this confinement effect with its suppression of nanoparticle movement and electrochemical dissolution was an efficient strategy to promote the stability of electrocatalyst.47 Meanwhile, the slope was also similar to the initial value (Fig. S17, ESI†), underscoring the superior stability of FeCo-NiIrPtPd/NCNT. As shown in Fig. 4f, FeCoNiIrPtPd/NCNT exhibited a better *i-t* stability; this result was due to its higher CO tolerance.

In summary, we have newly synthesized six-element high-entropy alloy nanoparticles encapsulated into nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (FeCoNiIrPtPd/NCNT). This FeCoNiIrPtPd/NCNT showed a promising HER electrocatalytic activity with an overpotential of 20 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> and a mass activity 3.4 times that of commercial Pt/C; moreover, due to the NCNT confinement effect, a superior stability was recorded. In addition, the ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) was also efficiently catalyzed by FeCoNiIrPtPd/NCNT, and exhibited an activity 1.6 times higher than that of commercial Pt/C, ascribed to a better CO tolerance.

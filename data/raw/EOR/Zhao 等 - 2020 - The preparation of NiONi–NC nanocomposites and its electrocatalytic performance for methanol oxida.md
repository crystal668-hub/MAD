Abstract: Direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs) have been extensively studied 1979/DONJO2045A developing a new non-precious metal catalyst to replace commercial platinum catalysts, due to its expensive cost and easy to CO poisoning. In this work, nickel oxide/nickel supported by N-doped carbon nanocomposites (NiO/Ni-N/C) were prepared through hydrothermal method and further carbonization at different temperature. The surface morphology and composition of the NiO/Ni-N/C nanocomposites were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS). Through electrochemical experiments, the NiO/Ni-N/C nanocomposites modified glassy carbon electrode (NiO/Ni-N/C/GCE) exhibits highly electrocatalytic activity to methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) in alkaline solution. Among them, the NiO/Ni-N/C carbonization at 500 °C (NiO/Ni-N/C<sub>500</sub>) displays the highest mass activity (1043 mA·mg<sub>Ni</sub>-1) at 0.73 V (vs Ag/AgCl), which much higher than that of the Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>/N-C and the NiO/Ni-N/C carbonization at other temperature (400, 600, 700 °C). In addition, the catalytic activity of the NiO/Ni-N/C<sub>500</sub> is 2.12 times that of the commercial Pt/C. The NiO/Ni-N/C<sub>500</sub>/GCE also possesses fast kinetics, excellent stability and CO tolerance. Therefore, the NiO/Ni-N/C<sub>500</sub> nanocomposites have great application potential as MOR catalyst.

The extensive use of fossil energy has brought serious pollution to the environment and threatened human health, so it's unsustainable energy.[1, 2] To reduce the continuing pollution of the environment and protect human health, green and sustainable energy conversion systems are urgently needed.[3, 4] Direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs) (a kind of proton membrane fuel cells) have been regarded as a promising energy conversion system due to its strong advantages in the past decades.[4-6] Methanol combustion is second only to hydrogen in energy density. Moreover, methanol possesses the advantages of cheaper, more abundant, renewable, easy to store and transport safely compared to hydrogen. The core reaction of DMFCs is methanol oxidation reaction (MOR). Methanol is oxidized to CO<sub>2</sub>, H<sup>+</sup> and e<sup>-</sup> by anode catalyst in the presence of H<sub>2</sub>O, according to the following equation (1):

Anode reaction: 
$$CH_3OH + H_2O \rightarrow CO_2 + 6 H^+ + 6 e^-$$
 (1)

DMFCs still face significant challenges of slow kinetics and CO poisoning in the MOR.[5] It has been proved that MOR kinetics in alkaline medium is faster than that in acidic medium.[7] Besides, both challenges can be addressed by developing efficient anode catalysts. So far, the best MOR catalyst is platinum; however, its expensive cost and easy to CO poisoning limit its widely application.[8, 9] Therefore, it is urgent need for developing low-platinum and non-platinum catalysts as an alternative one.[5]

Notably, nickel-based material is an excellent choice as a non-platinum catalyst for the MOR, because of its inexpensive cost, its stability to electrochemical process and its tolerance to poisoning.[10, 11] Positive nickel ions (Ni<sup>2+</sup> and Ni<sup>3+</sup>) will provide a stable ladder for electron transfer during the MOR.[10, 11] Recently, many efforts have been made on nickel-based materials.[12-16] Wu et al. used a simple one-pot method to prepare a unique Cu-Ni alloy electrocatalyst, and the mass activity (MA) for MOR reached 867.1 mA·mg<sub>metal</sub>-1 in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte with 1.0 M methanol.[12] Pieta et al. embedded the nickel heterostructure in the ultra-thin

two-dimensional (2D) g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> by a one-pot hydrothermal method, and obtained 3a/DONJO2045A Ni/CN with better MOR performance under visible light irradiation.[13] Noor et al. prepared NiO-MOF/rGO composites by hydrothermal method and studied its electrocatalytic activity for MOR in alkaline medium.[14] Arunachalam et al. prepared Ni/NiO catalyst and Meso Ni-Co-O-3 catalyst by microwave reaction method, and showed the methanol oxidation mass activities of 275 mA·mg<sup>-1</sup> and 750 mA·mg<sup>-1</sup> respectively.[15, 16] No matter how, it is still very necessary to develop novel nickel-based materials for further studying the MOR kinetics and improving its electrocatalytic activity.

Carbon materials have been widely used in the field of catalyst because of their good conductivity, excellent performance and low cost.[17] Some studies have shown that the metal active center was aggregated to some extent during electrochemical experiments.[18, 19] Some researches have demonstrated that carbon materials (graphene, porous carbon or carbon nanotubes) embrace the active metal or metallic compound nanoparticles (NPs) [20-26] not only can improve their electrical conductivity and activity, [23, 26, 27] but also effectively protect the nanoparticles from the influence of bad environment and weaken the nanoparticle corrosion/aggregation in the process of electrochemical measurement to enhance its durability. In addition, recent works have proved that N-doped carbon materials could avoid the aggregation of composite through electronic effect of the nitrogen, thus enhancing their stability.[28, 29] Therefore, nitrogen-doped carbon materials are beneficial to the comprehensive properties of composites. It is hoped that the electrocatalytic activity, kinetics and CO tolerance of such catalysts will be further enhanced by doping nitrogen into carbon materials which used to embrace the active centers of transition metals.

In this work, the nickel hydroxide composites were firstly synthesized by one-step hydrothermal method, and then were carbonized into nickel-oxide/nickel based nitrogen-doped carbon nanocomposites (NiO/Ni-N/C). The NiO/Ni-N/C

nanocomposites were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron/DONJO2045A microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS). The effect of carbonization temperature on the electrochemical and electrocatalytic properties of NiO/Ni-N/C was also studied. The results demonstrate that the nanocomposites carbonized at 500 °C (NiO/Ni-N/C<sub>500</sub>) exhibit the highest electrocatalytic activity for MOR. The NiO/Ni-N/C<sub>500</sub>/GCE also displays fast kinetics, excellent stability and CO tolerance.

In a typical procedure, Ni(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>·6H<sub>2</sub>O (0.5595 g) was dissolved in 15 mL methanol to form a clear solution, which was subsequently injected into 15 mL of methanol containing 0.6160 g 2-MI under ultrasonic for 10 min at room temperature. Then, this fresh mixed solution was heated at 120 °C for 4 h in an autoclave (Teflon lined). The precipitates were centrifuged and washed with ethanol three times and dried in vacuum at 70 °C for overnight. The green powder was ground evenly in agate mortar and denoted as nickel hydroxide supported by N-doped carbon nanocomposites (Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>/N-C).

The Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>/N-C was placed in a tube furnace, then heated to 400 °C, 500 °C 600 °C and 700 °C, respectively, for 3 h at the heating rate of 5 °C/min under flowing N<sub>2</sub> gas, and then naturally cooled to room temperature to obtain the NiO/Ni-N/C samples. The as-prepared products were directly used without any post-treatment.

The synthesis process of these NiO/Ni-N/C nanocomposites are shown in **Scheme 1**. During the carbonization process, the nickel atoms of the Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>/N-C catalyst are partially reduced to pure nickel and gradually reunite or partial oxidize to form nickel-oxide/nickel particles, while the structure of the composite partially During the carbonization process, the nickel atoms of the Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>/N-C catalyst are partially reduced to pure nickel and gradually reunite or partial oxidize to form nickel-oxide/nickel particles, while the structure of the composite partially sintering.

# 2.4. Preparation of the modified electrode

A catalyst ink was prepared through mixing of the synthesized materials (1 mg) or 10% Pt/C (1 mg), ultrapure water (990  $\mu$ L) and Nafion (10  $\mu$ L, 5 wt % solution), and ultrasound for 30min. Before modification, the GCE was successively polished with different size of alumina powder (1.0  $\mu$ m, 0.3  $\mu$ m and 0.05  $\mu$ m). The polished GCE were then alternating ultrasonic cleaning for three times by ultrapure water and ethanol, and then nitrogen blow-dried for further using. 5  $\mu$ L as prepared catalyst ink was deposited on the GCE by micropipette, and dried at room temperature. The obtained modified electrodes are named as the Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>/N-C/GCE and the NiO/Ni-N/C/GCE, respectively.

## 3. Results and discussion

The morphology of the different Ni-based nanocomposites was investigated by SEM. As shown in **Fig. 1A** and **Fig. 1B**, the Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>/N-C exhibits a unique sheet structure and interlaces with each other between the different sheets. After carbonization at 400 °C, the obtained NiO/Ni-N/C<sub>400</sub> (**Fig. 1C**) can basically maintain the morphology of the Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>/N-C. However, with the increase of carbonization temperature, the two-dimensional structure gradually appears different degrees of

sintering, as shown in Fig. 1D of NiO/Ni-N/C<sub>500</sub>, Fig. 1E of NiO/Ni-N/C<sub>600</sub> and  $\mathbf{Fig}^{\text{View Article Online}}$ 

**1F** of NiO/Ni-N/C<sub>700</sub>. Among them, the NiO/Ni-N/C<sub>500</sub> nanocomposites only occur slight structural sintering. In addition, the content of Ni was determined by ICP-OES analysis, and the results demonstrate that the Ni content of each catalyst (from Fig. 1B to Fig. 1F) was 53.55 wt. %, 82.73 wt. %, 89.43 wt. %, 98.66 wt. % and 98.64 wt. %, respectively.

The structure and composition of the different Ni-based nanocomposites were investigated by XRD. The XRD pattern shows that the Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>/N-C has a crystal structure similar to that of the Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> (JCPDS No.38-0715), as shown in **Fig. 2A**.[30] The sharp diffraction peaks at 11.16° can be ascribed to the addition of the like-GO carbon (001) and the Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>.[31] This demonstrates the formation of the Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>/N-C. The XRD patterns of the NiO/Ni-N/C carbonization at different temperature are shown in **Fig. 2B and 2C**. The diffraction peaks of **Fig. 2B** at 44.46°, 50.80° and 76.34° can be indexed to (111), (200) and (220) planes of pure Ni with *fcc*-structure (JCPDS No.01-087-0712).[18] As shown in **Fig. 2C**, the broad peak at 25.7° can be attributed to graphene-like carbon (d(002), JCPDS No.41-1487).[32, 33] Combined with the diffraction peak of the Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>/N-C and the NiO/Ni-N/C nanocomposites, it can be concluded that like-GO carbon is converted into

The Raman spectrum of the Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>/N-C is shown in **Fig. 3A**. The peak at 440 cm<sup>-1</sup> should be assigned to the Ni-OH stretching mode.[37] The peak at 1038 cm<sup>-1</sup> is due to the adsorbed nitrate anions, which indicates that the Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>/N-C contains the intercalated nitrate anions.[38] The peak at 3664 cm<sup>-1</sup> is related to the stretching vibration of the hydroxyl groups.[37, 39] The peaks at 698, 1157, 1451 and 2905 cm<sup>-1</sup> can be assigned to the  $\nu$ (CCH<sub>3</sub>),  $\rho$ (CH<sub>3</sub>),  $\delta$ (CH<sub>3</sub>) and  $\nu$ (CH<sub>3</sub>) modes of

2-methylimidazole groups, respectively.[40] The peaks at 976, 1277 and  $2797 \, ^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$   $^{12}$

The surface morphology and composition of the NiO/Ni-N/C<sub>500</sub> was further studied using TEM and elemental mapping, as shown in **Fig. 4** and **Fig. S1**. It can be clearly observed the cross-connected structure of the NiO/Ni-N/C<sub>500</sub> from TEM images in **Fig. 4A-B**. The enlarged TEM images of the NiO/Ni-N/C<sub>500</sub> are shown in **Fig. 4C-F**, and the lattice spacing of the NiO/Ni-N/C<sub>500</sub> is also presented by scientific measurement and calculation. In the **Fig. 4D** and **Fig. 4E**, the lattice spacing is about 0.206 nm and 0.205 nm, which is very close to the standard value of pure Ni (111) plane with *fcc*-structure (JCPDS No.01-087-0712).[18] In the **Fig. 4E** and **Fig. 4F**, the lattice spacing is about 0.242 nm, which is very close to the standard value of NiO

(111) plane (JCPDS No.47-1049).[34] In addition, the lattice spacing about 0.210 http://donio.com/ in Fig. 4F should be attributed to (200) plane of NiO (JCPDS No.47-1049).[34] The corresponding fast Fourier transform (FFT) pattern viewed from the [101] direction of the partially marked area in Fig. 4F is shown in Fig. 4G, which also present the NiO (111) and NiO (200) planes.[43] The lattice spacing and FFT pattern of the NiO/Ni-N/C500 nanocomposites are consistent well with the XRD pattern, which can further prove the formation of nickel (partially oxidized) nanoparticles. Fig. 4H-L display the HAADF-STEM and the elemental mapping images of the NiO/Ni-N/C<sub>500</sub> nanocomposites, in which reveals the homogeneous distribution of the four elements in the NiO/Ni-N/C<sub>500</sub> nanocomposites. Notably, such microscopic pore structure can provide a large contact area between the catalyst and electrolyte solution, which will be beneficial for electrocatalytic reactions. [44, 45] In addition, the special structure of the nickel nanoparticles embraced by the carbon is shown in Fig. S1. This structure can not only improve the conductivity of the catalyst, but also protect the metal active center from the aggregation of nanoparticles, so as to improve the stability of the MOR process.[27, 46]

**Fig. 5.** XPS spectra of C 1s (A), N 1s (B), O 1s (C) and Ni 2p (D) of the NiO/Ni-N/C<sub>500</sub> nanocomposites

The surface chemical composition and the oxidation states of the as-prepared materials were characterized by XPS. As shown in the XPS survey spectra of the NiO/Ni-N/C<sub>500</sub> in **Fig. S2**, it can be clearly observed C, O and Ni signals, and also the weak N characteristic peak. Meanwhile, the contents of C, N, O and Ni elements were calculated as 41.52, 2.4, 34.5 and 21.58 %, respectively. As shown in **Fig. 5A**, the high-resolution C 1s XPS spectrum of the NiO/Ni-N/C<sub>500</sub> appears three small peaks, which can be classified as C=C sp<sup>2</sup> (284.7 eV), C-C sp<sup>3</sup>/C=N sp<sup>2</sup> (285.6 eV) and C=O/C-N (288.6 eV). From the N 1s XPS spectrum in **Fig. 5B**, it can be found the presence of pyridinic N (399.3 eV) and pyrrolic N (400.2 eV), but haven't found Graphitic N and Oxidized N. This result strongly proves a certain number of N atoms doped into the carbon framework. The high-resolution O 1s XPS spectrum of the NiO/Ni-N/C<sub>500</sub> nanocomposites exhibit a clear peak (529.2 eV) for the metal-oxygen bond (**Fig. 5C**), indicating the existence of NiO. The other two characteristic peaks in

<del>√</del>16

the O1s spectrum can be attributed to O-C=O/C=O (531.1 eV) and C-O (532.5 eV). The O1s spectrum can be attributed to O-C=O/C=O (531.1 eV) and C-O (532.5 eV). addition, a weak peak at 529.0 eV may correspond to the Ni-O bond in nickel hydroxide (Fig. S3C).[47] As to the Ni 2p XPS, the two typical peaks of Ni are located at 855.6 eV and 873.5 eV, belonging to the spin-orbit splitting of 2p<sub>3/2</sub> and 2p<sub>1/2</sub>, respectively (Fig. 5D). In addition, the two peaks centered on 861.0 eV and 879.4 eV belong to the Ni 2p<sub>3/2</sub> and 2p<sub>1/2</sub> vibration peaks, respectively. Furthermore, two fitting peaks appear in the XPS spectrum of Ni 2p, located at the binding energy of 853.5 eV and 871.5 eV (Fig. 5D), which should be attributed to Ni(0).[19, 48] However, there is no peak corresponding to Ni(0) in the high-resolution Ni 2p XPS spectrum of Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>/N-C nanocomposites (Fig. S3E). The Ni 2p XPS results suggest that nickel atoms should be in the form of Ni<sup>0</sup> and Ni<sup>2+</sup> in the NiO/Ni-N/C<sub>500</sub> nanocomposites. The XPS results of C1s and O1s also exhibit a large number of oxygen-containing functional groups which expose to the surface of the NiO/Ni-N/C<sub>500</sub> nanocomposites.[49] Thus, the XPS results prove nickel atoms exist in the metallic phase of the NiO/Ni-N/C<sub>500</sub> nanocomposites as the form of Ni(0) and NiO, which is consistent with the XRD results.

Some studies suggest that the electrocatalytic activity of nickel-based materials to methanol oxidation is due to unpaired d-electrons or d-vacant orbitals in NiOOH.[50, 51] These unpaired d-electrons and empty d-orbitals could form chemical bonds with the absorbed material.[50, 51] The electrooxidation mechanism of methanol over NiO/Ni-N/C catalyst could be assumed as following:[34, 52]

$$Ni + 2OH^{-} \rightarrow Ni(OH)_{2} + 2e^{-}$$
 (2)

$$NiO + OH^- \rightarrow NiOOH + e^-$$
 (3)

$$Ni(OH)_2 + OH^- \rightarrow NiOOH + H_2O + e^-$$
 (4)

$$NiOOH + CH_3OH \rightarrow Ni(OH)_2 + products$$
 (5)

As shown in equations (3) and (4), the formation of NiOOH is an important step in the electrooxidation process of methanol based on nickel-based materials.[18] Thus, before the electrocatalytic activity tests, Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>/N-C/GCE and the NiO/Ni-N/C/GCE

were pretreated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) over 50 cycles at a scan rate of 200/DONJ02045A mV·s<sup>-1</sup> and 20 cycles at a scan rate of 50 mV·s<sup>-1</sup> in 1.0 M KOH in order to enrich hydroxide, which will increase the thickness of the electrocatalytic layers.[18, 34]

**Fig. 6.** The ECSA of (a) the Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>/N-C/GCE, (b) the NiO/Ni-N/C<sub>400</sub>/GCE, (c) the NiO/Ni-N/C<sub>500</sub>/GCE, (d) the NiO/Ni-N/C<sub>600</sub>/GCE and (e) the NiO/Ni-N/C<sub>700</sub> /GCE in 1.0 M KOH

The electrochemical activity specific surface area (ECSA) is an important parameter to measure the catalytic active of materials.[30, 53, 54] Herein, the ECSA of the Ni-based materials were calculated by CV in non-Faradaic potential region. As shown in **Fig. S4A-E**, CV curves were taken in potential range from -0.15 V to -0.05 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) at various scan rates of 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 mV·s<sup>-1</sup> in 1.0 M KOH solution. **Fig. S4A'-E'** are the capacitive current ((I<sub>a</sub>-I<sub>c</sub>)/2) at -0.1 V vs Ag/AgCl as a function of various scan rates, in which the double capacitance (C<sub>dl</sub>) are equal to the slopes. The C<sub>dl</sub> of the Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>/N-C/GCE, NiO/Ni-N/C<sub>400</sub>/GCE, NiO/Ni-N/C<sub>500</sub>/GCE, NiO/Ni-N/C<sub>600</sub>/GCE and NiO/Ni-N/C<sub>700</sub>/GCE are 7.01×10<sup>-3</sup>, 12.19×10<sup>-3</sup>, 10.05×10<sup>-3</sup>, 9.27×10<sup>-3</sup> and 7.32×10<sup>-3</sup> mF, respectively. According to formula (6):

$$ECSA = C_{dl} / (C_s \times 1)$$

The results demonstrated that the carbonization process can increase the ECSA of the /DONJ02045A Ni-based materials, which could be mainly attributed to the formation of nickel nanoparticles. In addition, the ECSA decreases continuously with the increase of carbonization temperature, possibly due to the sintering of materials.

The Nyquist plots of the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were recorded at an applied potential of 0.6 V (vs Ag/AgCl) over a frequency range of 1 to 100000 Hz to preliminary understand the MOR kinetics, as shown in Fig. S5.[56, 57] Obviously, the Nyquist diagram shows a semicircle shape, indicating that the electrode reaction is controlled by dynamic charge transfer process. The Nyquist plots are fitted by the equivalent circuit model (Fig. S5), which includes a solution resistance (R<sub>s</sub>), constant phase element (CPE) and a charge transfer resistance (R<sub>ct</sub>) for the electrochemical reaction. Due to the possible defects (such as kinks and charge inhomogeneities) of the catalyst surface, CPE was used instead of C<sub>dl</sub> between the electrode modification material and the electrolyte interface. [12, 57, 58] The R<sub>ct</sub> of the (Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>/N-C, NiO/Ni-N/C<sub>400</sub>, NiO/Ni-N/C<sub>500</sub>, NiO/Ni-N/C<sub>600</sub> and NiO/Ni-N/C<sub>700</sub>) are calculates as 771, 101, 68, 143 and 177  $\Omega$ , respectively. The R<sub>ct</sub> of the carbonized NiO/Ni-N/C is all much lower than that of the Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>/N-C, suggesting that carbonization process is helpful to reduce resistance and increase conductivity. Among them, the NiO/Ni-N/C<sub>500</sub> nanocomposites have the best conductivity and the MOR kinetics. In addition, compared with the reported NiO-MOF/rGO 5 wt% (R<sub>ct</sub> = 252.5 Ω) methanol oxidation catalyst, the NiO/Ni-N/C<sub>500</sub> nanocomposites possess better electrical conductivity.[14] Therefore, it can be predicted that the NiO/Ni-N/C<sub>500</sub> would exhibit good catalytic performance based on its higher ECSA and smaller resistance.

electrocatalytic properties of the Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>/N-C/GCE The the NiO/Ni-N/C/GCE were tested by CV at 50 mV·s<sup>-1</sup> in 1 M KOH with 3 M CH<sub>3</sub>OH. As shown in the CV curves of Fig. 7A, it can be found that the NiO/Ni-N/C500/GCE displays the best electrocatalytic activity to MOR at 0.73 V than the other modified electrodes. The lower catalytic activity of the NiO/Ni-N/C carbonized at 600 or 700 °C may be related to more severe sintering. MA (normalized by mass of catalyst) and specific activity (SA, normalized by ECSA of catalyst) of five catalysts are calculated and the histogram are shown in Fig. 7B, which we can observed the NiO/Ni-N/C<sub>500</sub>/GCE displays the highest MA (1043 mA·mg<sub>Ni</sub>-1) and SA (18.57 mA·cm<sup>-2</sup>). The well catalytic performance of the NiO/Ni-N/C<sub>500</sub>/GCE may be resulted in the coefficient of the partially oxidized nickel atoms and the formation of nickel

nanoparticles.[35, 36] Although the ECSA of the NiO/Ni-N/C<sub>500</sub>/GCE is photo the /DoNJ02045A largest one, it has the best conductivity, which may be the decisive reason for its highest catalytic activity. At the same time, an obvious anodic peak appears in the reverse scanning because of the oxidation of the adsorbed intermediate formed in the forward scanning, indicating that these catalysts possess good anti-poisoning performance.[59-61] We also compared the performance of the Ni-based nanocomposites with some reported catalysts, as shown in **Table S1**. It can be found that the NiO/Ni-N/C<sub>500</sub> nanocomposites exhibits better electrocatalytic activity.

The onset potential is an important criterion to evaluate the performance of catalysts, the lower onset potential means easier oxidation process on catalysts surface.[62, 63] As shown in **Fig. 7A**, the onset potentials for methanol electrooxidation of Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>/N-C (a), NiO/Ni-N/C<sub>400</sub> (b), NiO/Ni-N/C<sub>500</sub> (c), NiO/Ni-N/C<sub>600</sub> (d) and NiO/Ni-N/C<sub>700</sub> (e) are at 0.376 V, 0.385V, 0.379 V, 0.380 V and 0.394 V, respectively. The lower onset potential of the NiO/Ni-N/C<sub>500</sub> also can demonstrate its well electrocatalytic activity for MOR.

**Fig. 8.** (A) Tafel Plots and (B) I-t curves (for 10000s at 0.6 V vs Ag/AgCl) of (a) the Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>/N-C/GCE, (b) the NiO/Ni-N/C<sub>400</sub>/GCE, (c) the NiO/Ni-N/C<sub>500</sub>/GCE, (d) the NiO/Ni-N/C<sub>600</sub>/GCE and (e) the NiO/Ni-N/C<sub>700</sub>/GCE. All electrochemical tests were performed at 1.0 M KOH containing 3.0 M CH<sub>3</sub>OH

Electrochemical reaction kinetics can be described by Tafel plots. Generally, a smaller Tafel plot slope implies faster electrochemical kinetics and higher catalytic activity.[56, 64, 65] The Tafel slopes of the five samples (Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>/N-C, NiO/Ni-N/C<sub>400</sub>, NiO/Ni-N/C<sub>500</sub>, NiO/Ni-N/C<sub>600</sub> and NiO/Ni-N/C<sub>700</sub>) are 53.58, 29.70, 27.68, 32.07 and 34.40 mV·dec<sup>-1</sup>, respectively (**Fig. 8A**). The NiO/Ni-N/C<sub>500</sub> displays the lowest Tafel slope, which demonstrate the fastest MOR electrochemical reaction kinetics and the highest catalytic activity.[56, 64, 65] The Tafel slope of the NiO/Ni-N/C<sub>500</sub> is much smaller than that of the reported Ni-Co-2 material (159 mV·dec<sup>-1</sup>),[16] which indicates that the NiO/Ni-N/C<sub>500</sub> possesses fast kinetics characteristics. The stability of the modified electrodes was studied under chronoamperometric conditions by recording the current at 0.6 V (vs Ag/AgCl) in a 1.0 M KOH containing 3.0 M methanol. Chronoamperometry curves show that all the

**8B**). Among them, the NiO/Ni-N/C<sub>500</sub>/GCE maintains the highest current density, indicating that the NiO/Ni-N/C<sub>500</sub> has the strongest resistance to carbon monoxide poisoning. Finally, the catalytic activity and stability of the NiO/Ni-N/C<sub>500</sub> and the commercial Pt/C were compared. As shown in curve c of **Fig. 7A** and **Fig. S6A**, the catalytic activity of the NiO/Ni-N/C<sub>500</sub> is about 2.12 times that of the commercial Pt/C; additionally, its stability is much higher than that of the commercial Pt/C (**Fig. S6B**).

#### 4. Conclusion

In conclusion, we synthesized the NiO/Ni-N/C nanocomposites by means of hydrothermal and high-temperature annealing method. The NiO/Ni-N/C nanocomposites were characterized by XRD, SEM, TEM and XPS. Through electrochemical experiments, the NiO/Ni-N/C nanocomposites exhibit highly electrocatalytic activity to MOR under alkaline conditions, in which the NiO/Ni-N/C<sub>500</sub> possesses the best electrocatalytic performance with highly mass activity up to 1043 mA·mgNi<sup>-1</sup>. The NiO/Ni-N/C<sub>500</sub>/GCE also displays fast kinetics, excellent stability and good anti-toxicity. Therefore, this NiO/Ni-N/C<sub>500</sub> nanocomposites have great potential applications as MOR catalyst and should be of great significance in sustainable energy and environmental applications.

The nickel oxide/nickel supported by N-doped carbon nanocomposites (NiO/Ni-N/C) were prepared through hydrothermal method and further carbonization at different temperature. The NiO/Ni-N/C<sub>500</sub> displays the highest mass activity (1043 mA·mg<sub>Ni</sub><sup>-1</sup>) and specific activity (18.57 mA·cm<sup>-2</sup>) for methanol oxidation reaction.

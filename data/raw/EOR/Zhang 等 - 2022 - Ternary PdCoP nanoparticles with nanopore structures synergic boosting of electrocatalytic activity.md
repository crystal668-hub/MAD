# Ternary PdCoP nanoparticles with nanopore structures: synergic boosting of electrocatalytic activity for ethanol oxidation†

PdCoP nanoparticles (PdCoP NPs) with nanopore structures were synthesized by a facile one-pot solvothermal approach. Due to their unique geometric structures and the electronic and synergistic effects among multiple components, the optimized PdCoP NPs (PdCoP-NPs-1) show superior mass activity (5.97 A mg<sub>Pd</sub><sup>-1</sup>) for the ethanol oxidation reaction under alkaline conditions.

Direct ethanol fuel cells (DEFCs) have been recognized as a promising energy conversion device with high energy density and environmental friendliness.1 The performance of DEFCs mainly depends on the efficiency of the anodic ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR). However, the development of EOR is seriously impeded by the deficiency of anode electrocatalysts with optimal performance.<sup>2</sup> So far, platinum (Pt)-based and palladium (Pd)based materials have been widely researched as the anode electrocatalysts for the EOR.3 Compared with Pt, Pd-based materials are attractive alternative catalysts toward the EOR in alkaline environments because of low cost and high abundance.<sup>4</sup> Unfortunately, Pd-based electrocatalysts still suffer from sluggish kinetics and poisonous effects of carbonaceous intermediates in the EOR, which hinders their further utilization in DEFCs.<sup>5</sup> The improvement of the electrocatalytic performance of the Pd-based catalytic system for the EOR comes true by integrating different components or altering the phase structure.<sup>6</sup>

Recent studies have shown that heteroatom doping provides a promising strategy to improve the catalytic activity and durability by tuning the electronic structure of the catalysts.<sup>7</sup>

It has been demonstrated that P-modified Pd-based catalysts could greatly improve the alcohol electrooxidation process.8 The introduction of P in Pd-M (M: non-noble metal) catalysts shortens the distance between Pd and M active sites.9 The narrow distance of active sites can promote the formation of OH radicals and accelerate the combination of OH and CH<sub>3</sub>CO radicals, thereby promoting the adsorption/desorption for carbonaceous poison intermediates. 9b Yu et al. recently described a general two-step synthetic route to prepare phosphorusdoped Pd<sub>2</sub>Sn nanorods, where the catalytic activity is drastically enhanced by weakening the OH adsorption energy. 10 In addition, alloying Pd with oxophilic elements can optimize the electronic structure and change the d-band centre of Pd, which improves the tolerance of toxic intermediates and activity of catalysts. 11

The structures and dimensions of catalysts also have an imperative influence on their catalytic performance. Compared with other nanostructures, the open nanopore structures have the advantages of abundant active sites and high atom utilization, which are beneficial to enhance the catalytic performance for the electrocatalysts. 12 The Pd nanoparticles with nanopore structures are commonly prepared to acquire more accessible active sites and reduce the amount of Pd. Moreover, the porous catalysts with large specific surface area by engineering the porosity of nanoparticles show superior stability and high current density. 13 Accordingly, precise construction of structures at the atomic level endows another effective means for the rational design of the remarkable electrocatalysts.14

Herein, we reported a one-pot synthetic strategy for the fabrication of ternary PdCoP nanoparticles (PdCoP NPs). CO was used as the reductant and structure-directing agent to construct PdCoP NPs with nanopore structures during the synthesis. Due to the special structure of nanoparticles with nanopores, the PdCoP NPs possess large specific surface area and many active sites, which can accelerate electron and mass transfer. The introduction of oxophilic metal Co and nonmetal P would significantly improve the performance of the EOR through the synergistic and electronic effects. Consequently,

the optimized PdCoP NPs (PdCoP-NPs-1) show a high mass activity of 5.97 A mg<sub>Pd</sub><sup>-1</sup>, which is 8.41 times higher than that of commercial Pd/C (0.71 A mg<sub>Pd</sub><sup>-1</sup>).

Fig. 1a and Fig. S1 (ESI†) present the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the Pd<sub>31</sub>Co<sub>44</sub>P<sub>25</sub> NPs (the compositions were determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy, ICP-OES) with the average diameter of about 20 nm. The characteristics of structure for the Pd<sub>31</sub>Co<sub>44</sub>P<sub>25</sub> NPs were revealed by high resolution TEM (HRTEM) and fast Fourier transform (FFT).

The FFT patterns of the selected-regions of the Pd<sub>31</sub>Co<sub>44</sub>P<sub>25</sub> NPs display discrete spots and visible amorphous rings, proving the simultaneous existence of the crystalline and amorphous structures (Fig. 1b and c and Fig. S2, ESI†).8b,15 From the white dashed box in Fig. 1c, lattice fringes with distances of 0.214 nm and 0.195 nm can be observed, corresponding to the (111) and (200) planes of the face-centred-cubic (fcc) PdCoP nanocrystals. The corresponding FFT patterns from the red dashed box in Fig. 1c and Fig. S2b (ESI†) further demonstrate the amorphous structures. The elemental mapping images display the uniform distribution of Pd (blue), Co (green) and P (red) elements in the nanoparticles (Fig. 1d-h). Notably, the line-scan analysis data depict that the central region of the Pd<sub>31</sub>Co<sub>44</sub>P<sub>25</sub> NPs exhibits a small number of element vacancies, which well illustrates the formation of the nanopores (Fig. 1i).

The adoption of surfactants or capping agents during synthesis can hinder the exposure of catalytically active sites. 16 Therefore, it is necessary to remove impurities to achieve the goal of surface cleanliness. 17 Here, we simply treated the Pd<sub>31</sub>Co<sub>44</sub>P<sub>25</sub> NPs with a mixed solution of acetic acid and ethanol (named PdCoP-NPs-1) without affecting the structure and size of the nanocatalysts. Fig. 1j shows the powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns of

PdCoP NPs with different atomic ratios after acetic acid treatment. The diffraction peaks of the as-synthesized PdCoP-NPs-1, PdCoP-NPs-2 and PdCo-NPs-3 located at  $40.49^{\circ}$ ,  $40.48^{\circ}$  and  $40.40^{\circ}$ correspond to the (111) planes of fcc Pd (JCPDS: 46-1043).18 Obviously, the peak positions positively shift to higher angles compared with that of Pd metal (40.11°), which originates from the doping of Co and P atoms into the lattice of Pd. The TEM and FFT images in Fig. S3a and b (ESI†) demonstrate that the PdCoP-NPs-1 still consisted of crystalline and amorphous phases. Compared with Pd31Co44P25 NPs, the EDS mapping images of PdCoP-NPs-1 show that the number of Co atoms in the samples decreased after acetic acid treatment (Fig. S3c-g, ESI†). The atomic ratio of PdCoP-NPs-1 was measured by ICP-OES, and confirmed that the Pd/Co/P atomic ratio is 49/26/25. The chemical composition of PdCoP-NPs-1 characterized by energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) (Fig. S4b, ESI†) matches well with the result of ICP-OES (Table S1, ESI†).

The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis measurements were further conducted to investigate the surface electronic bonding states and elemental constituents of the PdCoP-NPs-1. The XPS survey spectrum shows the presence of Pd, Co and P elements in the samples (Fig. S5a, ESI†). Major Pd(0) and minor Pd(II) are observed from the Pd  $3d_{5/2}$  and  $3d_{3/2}$ spectra, indicating that Pd primarily exists in the metallic state (Fig. S5b, ESI†). The binding energy of Pd 3d<sub>5/2</sub> (335.48 eV) in PdCoP-NPs-1 positively shifts by 0.28 eV compared with metal Pd (335.20 eV) reported previously. The Co 2p<sub>3/2</sub> spectrum is split into three peaks. The binding energy of Co(0) (778.05 eV) (Fig. S5c, ESI†) in PdCoP-NPs-1 is negatively shifted by 0.25 eV compared with metal Co (778.30 eV) reported in the literature.<sup>19</sup> For the P 2p spectrum, the strong peak located at 133.59 eV can be ascribed to oxidized phosphorus species, whereas other peaks located at 130.29 eV  $(2p_{1/2})$  and 129.46 eV  $(2p_{3/2})$  could be assigned to P(0) species (Fig. S5d, ESI†).20 In addition, the binding energies of P 2p<sub>3/2</sub> and P 2p<sub>1/2</sub> display negative shifts compared to red phosphorus (130.40 eV).21 Such results indicate that strong electronic interactions have occurred among Pd, Co, and P in PdCoP-NPs-1.

To better investigate the growth mechanism of Pd<sub>31</sub>Co<sub>44</sub>P<sub>25</sub> NPs, intermediates were extracted at different temperatures and further collaboratively characterized by TEM and PXRD. The schematic illustration highlights the intuitive structural evolution of the Pd<sub>31</sub>Co<sub>44</sub>P<sub>25</sub> NPs (Scheme 1). At the incipient reaction stage (at 130 °C), the nanosheet structures were clearly observed by TEM (Fig. S6a, ESI†). The PXRD patterns (Fig. S6d, ESI†) indicate that the distinct sharp peaks of the samples correspond to pure Pd (JCPDS: 46-1043). The results indicate

that Pd nanosheets are first generated and Co and P are not involved in the reaction process at 130 °C. When the temperature ramped to 220 °C, nanoparticles were detected and nanopores appeared on these nanoparticles (Fig. S6b, ESI†). In the stage of temperature elevating, nanosheets were prone to transition to nanoparticles due to their larger specific surface area and unstable geometry at a higher temperature. The nanoparticles possess a thermodynamically stable structure because of their lower surface energy. Simultaneously, the Co atoms and P atoms combine with Pd nanocrystals, and create favourable growth sites for conformal growth. The XPS spectra testify to the existence of Pd, Co and P elements at 220 °C (Fig. S7, ESI†). Pd nanocrystals react with two species of Co and P at the interface. When the outward diffusion of Pd goes faster than the inward diffusion of Co and P, nanopores are formed in the PdCoP NPs.<sup>22</sup> Nanoparticles with larger particle size (Fig. 1a) were formed when the temperature was raised to 270  $^{\circ}$ C. Fig. S6d (ESI†) shows that the measured PXRD peaks of the samples are shifted to higher angles with an increase in the reaction temperature, demonstrating that crystal lattices can be constricted. The results also imply that a growing number of Co and P atoms participate in the entire phase transformation process with an

In order to explore the effect of CO on the structure during the synthesis of PdCoP NPs, we synthesized a nanomaterial by removing CO without changing the reaction conditions. As revealed in Fig. S6c (ESI†), nanoparticles with a size of about 5.50 nm can be observed. Compared with Pd<sub>31</sub>Co<sub>44</sub>P<sub>25</sub> NPs, the shape and size of the as-prepared nanoparticles without CO are in noticeable variation. The result of PXRD also shows that these nanoparticles exhibit a peak at 40.11°, which can be well indexed to the (111) planes of Pd (Fig. S6d blue line, ESI†).<sup>23</sup> The results show that the introduction of CO may foster the combination of Co atoms and P atoms with Pd, enabling the generation of PdCoP NPs with nanopores. Meanwhile, the introduction of gas has a good effect on bubbling and accelerating the mutual diffusion of atoms, which promotes the formation of nanopore structures in the kinetically controlled growth of the reaction.24

To evaluate the electrocatalytic properties of the catalysts, the cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of the as-prepared PdCoP NPs catalysts, commercial Pd/C and PdCo alloy (Fig. S12b, ESI†) were obtained in N<sub>2</sub>-saturated 1.0 M KOH solution at a scan rate of 50 mV s<sup>-1</sup> (Fig. 2a). The electrochemically active surface areas (ECSAs) of the catalysts are an important parameter to assess the behaviours of the EOR. The ECSA values of PdCoP-NPs-1, PdCoP-NPs-2, PdCoP-NPs-3, PdCo and commercial Pd/C are calculated to be 33.00, 30.27, 30.02, 26.70 and 19.70 m $^2$  g<sub>Pd</sub> $^{-1}$ , respectively. As shown in Fig. 2b, the EOR performances of the PdCoP-NPs-1, PdCoP-NPs-2, PdCoP-NPs-3, PdCo and commercial Pd/C catalysts were evaluated in 1.0 M KOH and 1.0 M C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OH solution at a scan rate of 50 mV s<sup>-1</sup>. The mass activities (normalized to the content of Pd) of PdCoP-NPs-1 (5.97 A mg<sub>Pd</sub><sup>-1</sup>), PdCoP-NPs-2 (5.25 A  $mg_{Pd}^{-1}$ ), PdCoP-NPs-3 (4.57 A  $mg_{Pd}^{-1}$ ) and PdCo (2.82 A mg<sub>Pd</sub><sup>-1</sup>) are 8.41, 7.40, 6.44 and 3.97 times greater than

that of commercial Pd/C (0.71 A  $mg_{Pd}^{-1}$ ), respectively. Apparently, PdCoP-NPs-1 exhibit the best mass activity (MA) among these catalysts. Moreover, compared with previously reported Pd-based catalysts, the PdCoP-NPs-1 exhibits competitively high mass activities for the EOR in alkaline media (Table S2, ESI†). The specific activities of PdCoP-NPs-1 (18.21 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>), PdCoP-NPs-2 (17.34 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>), PdCoP-NPs-3 (15.23 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>) and PdCo (10.55 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>) are 5.02, 4.78, 4.20 and 2.91 times higher than that of commercial Pd/C (3.63 mA cm $^{-2}$ ) (Fig. 2c). The decay of the current over time was measured by means of chronoamperometry (CA) (Fig. 2d). The mass activity of PdCoP-NPs-1 is still higher than that of other catalysts after 2000 s, reflecting that PdCoP-NPs-1 has a superior stability. After the electrochemical stability test, the TEM images reveal that the PdCoP-NPs-1 still maintains nanopore structures, indicating that it possesses great stability of the structure (Fig. S8, ESI†). To further elucidate the enhanced catalytic activity of PdCoP-NPs-1 toward the EOR, the Tafel slope was used to analyse the electrochemical kinetic process. As revealed in Fig. S9 (ESI†), PdCo-NPs-1 has the smallest Tafel slope of 0.173 V dec<sup>-1</sup> compared with other synthesized catalysts and Pd/C, demonstrating a conducive EOR kinetic process. The CO stripping experiments were performed to explore the tolerance of the catalyst to toxic intermediates (particular CO<sub>ads</sub>).<sup>25</sup> Fig. S10 (ESI†) presents that the CO oxidation peak potential of PdCoP-NPs-1 (0.686 V vs. RHE) is negatively shifted compared with that of commercial Pd/C (0.777 V vs. RHE), indicating that PdCoP-NPs-1 possesses a better ability to oxidize CO. These results show that the incorporations of oxophilic metal Co and nonmetal P lead to the facile adsorption of OH<sub>ads</sub>, thereby significantly promoting the removal of toxic intermediates. 10 The unique geometric structures provide Communication ChemComm

sufficient active sites to further promote the electrooxidation of intermediates.  $^{9a}\,$ 

In order to investigate the effect of crystallinity and phase structure on electrocatalytic performance, the obtained Pd<sub>31</sub>Co<sub>44</sub>P<sub>25</sub> NPs are further annealed at 300 °C for 2 h under gas (95%N<sub>2</sub>/5%H<sub>2</sub>) atmosphere to yield Pd<sub>31</sub>Co<sub>44</sub>P<sub>25</sub>-300 nanomaterials. As shown in Fig. S11a (ESI†), the corresponding FFT pattern of Pd<sub>31</sub>Co<sub>44</sub>P<sub>25</sub>-300 NPs still presents the co-existence of both crystalline spots and amorphous rings after annealing treatment. Nevertheless, the random region (Fig. S11b, ESI†) in Pd<sub>31</sub>Co<sub>44</sub>P<sub>25</sub>-300 NPs introduces better crystallinity than Pd<sub>31</sub>-Co<sub>44</sub>P<sub>25</sub> NPs. When the annealing temperature was increased to 375 °C, the phase composition turned into phosphide (Fig. S12a, ESI†). However, the mass activities of PdCoP-NPs-1-300  $(4.14 \text{ A mg}_{Pd}^{-1})$  and PdCoP-NPs-1-375  $(2.94 \text{ A mg}_{Pd}^{-1})$  are lower than that of the PdCoP-NPs-1 (Fig. S13, ESI†). The results indicate that the increase of crystalline regions and the change in phase structure after annealing are not conducive to the improvement of the EOR performance.

In summary, PdCoP NPs with superior EOR activity have been successfully synthesized via a facile one-pot solvothermal method. The study of the growth mechanism proves that PdCoP NPs are transformed from Pd nanosheets. Moreover, the introduction of CO as the reductant and structure-directing agent is demonstrated to be the decisive key for the successful synthesis of PdCoP NPs with nanopore structures. The mass and specific activities of PdCoP-NPs-1 are 5.97 A mg<sub>Pd</sub><sup>-1</sup> and 18.21 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, which are 8.41 and 5.02 times those of commercial Pd/C, respectively. In addition, the mass and specific activities of PdCoP-NPs-1 also significantly outweigh those of PdCo alloy catalysts. The improvement of EOR performance relies on the electronic and synergistic effects among Pd, Co and P atoms and the unique geometric structures. This research demonstrates a practical method of incorporation of nonmetal and non-noble metal into noble metal-based materials to enhance the EOR performance.

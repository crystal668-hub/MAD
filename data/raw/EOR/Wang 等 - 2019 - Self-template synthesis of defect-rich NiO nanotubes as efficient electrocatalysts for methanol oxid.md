# Self-template synthesis of defect-rich NiO nanotubes as efficient electrocatalysts for methanol oxidation reaction†

Tian-Jiao Wang,<sup>a</sup> Hao Huang,<sup>b</sup> Xin-Ru Wu,<sup>a</sup> Hong-Chang Yao,<sup>c</sup> Fu-Min Li, b \*b Pei Chen,<sup>a</sup> Pu-Jun Jin,<sup>a</sup> Zi-Wei Deng and Yu Chen \*b \*a

Developing robust and inexpensive non-noble metal based anode electrocatalysts is highly desirable for alkaline direct methanol fuel cells (ADMFCs). Herein, we successfully develop a facile self-template synthetic strategy for gram-grade porous NiO nanotubes (NTs) by pyrolyzing a nanorod-like Ni-dimethylglyoxime complex. The pyrolysis temperature highly correlates with the morphology and crystallinity of NiO NTs. The optimal NiO NTs exhibit a large electrochemically active surface area, a fast catalytic kinetics, and a small charge transfer resistance, which induce an outstanding electrocatalytic activity for the methanol oxidation reaction (MOR). Compared with conventional NiO nanoparticles, NiO NTs achieve a 11.5-fold increase in mass activity at 1.5 V for the MOR due to nanotubal morphology and abundant non-vacancy defects on the NiO NT surface. Moreover, NiO NTs have a higher electrocatalytic activity for the intermediates of the MOR (such as formaldehyde and formate) than conventional NiO nanoparticles, which also contribute to MOR activity enhancement. Given the facile synthesis and enhanced electrocatalytic performance, NiO NTs may be promising anode electrocatalysts for ADMFCs.

#### Introduction

The sharp contradiction between energy demand and environmental issues has prompted humans to develop sustainable green energy conversion technologies, including photovoltaic systems, biomass energy, fuel cells and so on. Among them, benefiting from a compact structure, high energy fuel (methanol), and long duration, alkaline direct methanol fuel cells (ADMFCs) are considered as one of the excellent portable energy supply devices. <sup>1–5</sup> Nevertheless, the commercialization of ADMFCs still has considerable obstacles. In particular, the methanol oxidation reaction (MOR), the proprietary anode reaction of ADMFCs, often exhibits a slow kinetics, resulting in a low power density. <sup>1–5</sup> Platinum (Pt)-based precious metal

which greatly increases the cost of ADMFCs. Therefore, a lot of research studies have focused on the development of efficient and cost-effective non-noble metal MOR electrocatalysts.<sup>6,7</sup>

As a candidate for Pt-based materials, inexpensive nickel

nanomaterials are conventional electrocatalysts for the MOR,

As a candidate for Pt-based materials, inexpensive nickel (Ni)-based (metallic Ni or nickel oxide) electrocatalysts have been confirmed to have a certain electrocatalytic activity for the MOR. 8-24 For example, Cui *et al.* achieved the synthesis of several hierarchically structured Ni–Cu alloy networks, in which Ni<sub>0.75</sub>Cu<sub>0.25</sub> revealed the best electrocatalytic activity for the MOR due to the unique structure. Luo and co-workers fabricated oxygen vacancy-enriched ultrathin NiO nanosheets with a high MOR activity, in which the two-dimensional structure and defects were responsible for the remarkable MOR performance. Thus, unique morphology and abundant defect sites may be crucial for the design and synthesis of highly efficient Ni-based MOR electrocatalysts.

Recently, one-dimensionally (1D) hollow nanostructures, such as nanotubes (NTs), have become a desirable morphology for electrocatalysts. <sup>25-41</sup> In particular, the superior 1D structure can endow nanomaterials with a high flexibility, high conductivity, and inherent anisotropic morphology. <sup>42</sup> And, the hollow structure also enhances the utilization and specific surface area of nanomaterials. <sup>43</sup> For example, Zhu and co-workers synthesized a series of Ir–Ag NTs by chemical etching, which exhibited an excellent electrocatalytic activity for overall water

splitting.<sup>26</sup> By alkaline-etching and annealing, Chou and coworkers developed the synthesis of Fe-Ni-Mo nitride porous NTs as highly efficient electrocatalysts for Zn-air batteries and full water splitting.<sup>27</sup> Classically, the template method is a common approach for synthesizing 1D hollow structures, which can be divided into hard template, soft template, and self-template methods in detail. 26-41,44-46 Among them, the self-template strategy is the most desirable due to the following advantages. 44-48 First of all, the products can be obtained directly without further processing. Secondly, the synthesis process generally does not require a surfactant, which ensures that the electrocatalyst has a clean outer surface that is favourable for electrocatalysis. Finally, the products tend to have a rough surface due to the assembly process of secondary nanoparticles, resulting in abundant defect sites with a high activity. 49 Therefore, a self-template strategy for synthesizing NiO NTs that can achieve morphology control and defect introduction is still highly desirable.

Herein, we successfully synthesized well-defined NiO NTs by pyrolysis of a special precursor (Ni-dimethylglyoxime complex, Ni(DMG)<sub>2</sub>). The rod-like Ni(DMG)<sub>2</sub> complex plays a decisive role in obtaining tubular products through a self-template pyrolysis process. Surprisingly, abundant grain boundaries and atomic steps exist on the NiO NT surface, which have a high reactivity. Benefiting from these structural advantages, NiO NTs exhibit robust electrocatalytic performance for the MOR in alkaline media.

## Experimental

#### Reagents and chemicals

Nickel(II) nitrite hexahydrate  $(Ni(NO_3)_2 \cdot 6H_2O)$ , (CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>OH), methanol (CH<sub>3</sub>OH), and formaldehyde (HCHO) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Potassium hydroxide (KOH) and potassium formate (HCOOK) were obtained from Alfa Aesar (China) Chemicals Co., Ltd. Dimethylglyoxime (DMG) was purchased from Xi'an Chemical Reagent Factory, and ultrapure water (resistance >18 M $\Omega$  cm<sup>-1</sup>) was prepared using a Milli-Q system (Millipore Co., USA).

#### Synthesis of Ni(DMG)<sub>2</sub>, NiO NTs-350, NiO NTs-400, NiO NRs-450, and NiO NPs-400

For the preparation of Ni(DMG)<sub>2</sub>, 0.1 M DMG ethanol solution (4 mL) was poured into 0.1 M Ni(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>·6H<sub>2</sub>O aqueous solution (2 mL) at room temperature. Then, the mixture was shaken for five minutes. After centrifugation and washing with ethanol, Ni(DMG)<sub>2</sub> was dried using a vacuum oven at 60 °C.

The NiO nanostructures were prepared by the pyrolysis of Ni(DMG)<sub>2</sub> at different temperatures (350, 400 and 450 °C) in the air for 2 h at a heating rate of 2 °C min<sup>-1</sup>, which were named as NiO NTs-350, NiO NTs-400, and NiO nanorods (NiO NRs-450). The conventional NiO nanoparticles (NPs) were prepared by the pyrolysis of Ni(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>·6H<sub>2</sub>O at 400 °C, which were named as NiO NPs-400.

#### Characterization

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images and element distribution images were taken using a SU-8020 scanning electron microscope with an energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) detector. Thermal gravimetric (TG) analysis was conducted with a STA449F5 synchronous thermal analyzer. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were detected using a DX-2700 power X-ray diffractometer with a Cu Ka radiation source. The electronic structure of Ni was investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Kratos Analytical Ltd). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images, high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) images and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern were taken using a TECNAI G2 F20 transmission electron microscope. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra were obtained using an E500 electron paramagnetic spectrometer.

#### **Electrochemical measurements**

Cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectrum (EIS) analysis and chronoamperometry tests were conducted using a CHI 660 C electrochemical workstation using a standard three-electrode system at 30  $\pm$  1 °C, in which a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) was used as the reference electrode, an electrocatalyst-modified glassy-carbon electrode as the working electrode, and a carbon rod as the counter electrode. The electrocatalyst ink was prepared by adding 10 mg NiO nanomaterials to a solution consisting of deionized water (2.0 mL), isopropanol (0.5 mL) and 5 wt% Nafion (10 µL) under ultrasonic dispersion. The working electrodes were prepared by dropping 5 µL of the electrocatalyst ink on glassycarbon electrodes and dried at room temperature. The electrolytes consisted of 1 M KOH, or 1 M KOH with 0.5 M CH<sub>3</sub>OH, or 1 M KOH with 0.5 M HCHO, or 1 M KOH with 0.5 M HCOOK, respectively. All electrode potentials were converted to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) by  $E_{RHE} = E_{SCE} + 0.242 \text{ V} +$ 0.059 pH.

#### Results and discussion

#### Synthesis and characterization of Ni(DMG)<sub>2</sub> complex precipitate

As a reaction precursor, the Ni(DMG)<sub>2</sub> complex was prepared via a simple mixture of Ni(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> aqueous solution and DMG ethanol solution. This coordination process between Ni(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> and DMG can occur quickly and generate a red Ni(DMG)2 complex precipitate (Fig. S1†). XRD test results showed that the diffraction peaks of the red precipitate were consistent with those of the Ni(DMG)<sub>2</sub> complex reported in the literature (Fig. 1A). 50,51 SEM and TEM were performed to probe the structural characteristics of the Ni(DMG)2 complex. Surprisingly, the obtained Ni(DMG)2 complex exhibited a uniform rod-like structure (Fig. 1B and C). Furthermore, the uniform distribution of Ni, C, N and O was revealed by SEM-EDX analysis, proving the successful preparation of the rod-like Ni(DMG)2 complex (Fig. 1D).

#### Synthesis and characterization of NiO NTs

To convert the Ni(DMG)2 complex to NiO, the coordination bond between Ni<sup>2+</sup> and DMG needs to be replaced by a Ni-O covalent bond. Considering that air is a good oxygen-rich environment and DMG will decompose or oxidize at a high temperature, the Ni(DMG)2 complex may be converted into NiO by a pyrolysis process in air. To determine the appropriate pyrolysis temperature, TG analysis of the Ni(DMG)<sub>2</sub> complex was performed. The TG curve shows that the Ni(DMG)2 complex has a significant weight loss at approximately 290 °C and reaches a new stage at approximately 320 °C (Fig. 2A). To ensure complete reaction, the pyrolysis temperature is set to 350 °C for NiO NTs synthesis. After 2 h of pyrolysis, the gray

product is obtained (Fig. S2†), which is significantly different from the red Ni(DMG)2 complex. The XRD pattern of the gray product is then recorded, and the analysis result suggests a phase of NiO (PDF#65-2901, Fig. 2B). Moreover, the broadened XRD diffraction peaks imply that the product is nano-sized NiO materials (i.e., NiO nanostructures). Then, two higher pyrolysis temperatures, including 400 °C and 450 °C, are set to synthesize NiO. The XRD patterns of these products suggest that they are all NiO nanostructures (Fig. 2B). To excavate more correlation between pyrolysis temperature and product, more XRD patterns in the small measurement range (40-47°) are recorded. With an increase of pyrolysis temperature, the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the (200) diffraction peak decreases, suggesting an elevated crystallinity (Fig. 2C and D). In general, the crystallinity of the nanomaterials highly correlates with conductivity and defects. So the XRD analysis of these NiO nanostructures also predicts their different catalytic performance, especially the electrocatalytic activity. In addition, the electronic structure of Ni in NiO nanostructures obtained at 400 °C was investigated by XPS as a representative. The corresponding Ni 2p XPS spectrum shows a set of doublet peaks derived from Ni<sup>2+</sup> together with a set of satellite peaks, further confirming the successful preparation of NiO nanostructures (Fig. S3†).

The morphological information of the NiO products was revealed and recorded by SEM. Amazingly, all products obtained under different pyrolysis temperatures still maintain the original 1D structure, and the interior is empty at the pyrolysis temperatures of 350 °C and 400 °C, suggesting the successful preparation of NiO NTs (Fig. 3A, B and D, E). In the wet chemical self-template synthetic method, the formation mechanism of hollow nanomaterials is generally explained by the inside-out Ostwald ripening. 52,53 Considering that both gas and liquid are fluids, they should have similar dynamic properties as reaction media. Thus, inside-out Ostwald ripening is also responsible for the generation of NiO NTs in our synthesis. In detail, the surface of the Ni(DMG)2 complex first decomposes into NiO grains, and then the internal components are decomposed and diffused onto the formed NiO grains to finally obtain NiO NTs. When the pyrolysis temperature is 450 °C, the pyrolysis rate is very high, but the mass transfer does not match. So, although the product still maintains the 1D structure, most of the products are solid (Fig. 3C and F), that is, NiO nanorods (i.e., NiO NRs-450). Furthermore, the HR-SEM images indicate that these products are composed of NiO nanocrystals and the surface is rough (Fig. 3D-F). Such structures generally result in a large specific surface area and abundant defects with a high catalytic activity. 54,55 Elemental mapping images recorded by SEM-EDX show that Ni and O are evenly distributed on single nanostructures, which also confirms the successful synthesis of NiO nanotubes or nanorods (Fig. 3G-I). To obtain detailed structural information about the size of these NiO nanocrystal subunits, TEM images were collected and analyzed. After measurement and statistics, the size distribution histograms show that the average sizes of the

NiO nanocrystals on NiO NTs-350, NiO NTs-400, and NiO NRs-450 are 9.4, 17.6, and 29.4 nm, respectively (Fig. 3J-L). Obviously, the mean size of the NiO nanocrystal subunits increases with the pyrolysis temperature, which is in agreement with the XRD results. Careful observation of these TEM images shows that the accumulation of these NiO nanocrystals is not dense, and the bright regions between the NiO nanocrystals also reveal a porous structure (Fig. 3] and K). This structure allows the NiO NTs to expose more active sites and accelerate mass transfer during the catalytic process.<sup>55</sup> These electron microscopy analyses demonstrate that the Ni(DMG)<sub>2</sub> complex-assisted self-template method can efficiently synthesize porous NiO NTs under the appropriate pyrolysis temperature. Additionally, since the synthesis method is simple and easy to handle, the gram-grade NiO NTs can also be obtained easily by increasing the amount of DMG and Ni(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>·6H<sub>2</sub>O reaction precursor (Fig. S4†).

#### MOR performance of different NiO nanostructures

Prior to the MOR performance test, the electrochemical properties of these NiO nanostructures modified electrodes were determined by CV in 1 M KOH solution. All CV curves show a clear pair of redox peaks among 1.2–1.5 V, which stem from the Ni<sup>2+</sup>/Ni<sup>3+</sup> redox process (Fig. 4A). Considering that Ni<sup>2+</sup>/Ni<sup>3+</sup> redox species highly correlate with the MOR activity, their surface coverage ( $\Gamma^*$ ) on these NiO nanostructures modified electrodes is investigated by the following equation:  $\Gamma^* = j_p$ /

Among them, NiO NTs-400 have the biggest  $\Gamma^*$ , predicting the best electrochemical reactivity.  $^{8,56}$ 

The MOR activity of the NiO NTs was investigated in 1 M KOH + 0.5 M methanol solution. As the pyrolysis temperature increases, the oxidation current at 1.5 V ( $j_{1.5v}$ ) and onset oxidation potential ( $E_{\rm onset}$ ) of the MOR on the corresponding NiO nanostructures modified electrodes exhibit a volcano-like correlation (Fig. 4B and C). The top electrocatalysts are NiO NTs-400 ( $j_{1.5v}$  = 24.3 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> and  $E_{\rm onset}$  = 1.33 V), which is consistent with the prediction of CV results, revealing the optimal pyrolysis temperature. In particular, the MOR activity of NiO NTs-400 has exceeded many reported Ni-based electrocatalysts (Table 1).<sup>8-11,14,23,57,58</sup> According to the physical characterization above, the pyrolysis temperature highly correlates with the crystallinity and morphology of these NiO nanostructures,

which in turn determine their electrocatalytic properties. As a control test, NiO nanoparticles (NiO NPs-400) were synthesized by direct pyrolysis of Ni(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> at 400 °C. The successful acquisition of NiO NPs-400 was determined by XRD and SEM (Fig. S5†). The MOR activity of NiO NPs-400 is much lower than that of NiO NTs-400 (Fig. 4B and C), highlighting the superior 1D porous hollow nanostructures of NiO NTs-400. In detail,  $j_{1.5v}$  of MOR on NiO NTs-400 is 11.5 times that on NiO NPs-400, and E<sub>onset</sub> of NiO NTs-400 is negatively shifted by 70 mV from that of NiO NPs-400. As a necessary characteristic parameter, the electrochemically active surface areas (ECSAs) of these catalysts should be determined. For NiO-based materials, ECSA is generally estimated by recording the nonfaradaic current at different scan rates, namely the doublelayer capacitance ( $C_{\rm dl}$ ) method (Fig. S6†). The fitted line based on the CV curves show that  $C_{\rm dl}$  of NiO NTs-350, NiO NTs-400, NiO NRs-450, and NiO NPs-400 is 0.29 mF, 0.26 mF, 0.15 mF, and 0.025 mF, suggesting the corresponding ECSA of 36.25 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>, 32.5 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>, 18.75 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>, and 3.125 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>, respectively (Fig. 4D). It is worth noting that ECSA of NiO NTs-400 is 10.4-fold bigger than NiO NPs-400, which is attributed to the superior 1D porous hollow nanostructure of NiO NTs. These ECSA values are in good agreement with the SEM results and also partially explain the different MOR activities of these electrocatalysts.

The MOR kinetics and electron transfer processes on these NiO nanostructures were further investigated by Tafel plots and EIS. The Tafel plots were obtained from the corresponding CV curves of the MOR. By linear fitting, Tafel slopes of the MOR on NiO NTs-350, NiO NTs-400, NiO NRs-450, and NiO NPs-400 are obtained as 113 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>, 82 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>, 149 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>, and 301 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>, respectively (Fig. 4E). The smallest Tafel slope on NiO NTs-400 implies the optimal MOR reaction kinetics. 59,60 The EIS test results show that the charge transfer resistance  $(R_{ct})$  of the MOR on these NiO nanostructures follows the order of NiO NTs-400 (129  $\Omega$ ) < NiO NTs-350 (153  $\Omega$ ) < NiO NRs-450 (339  $\Omega$ ) < NiO NPs-400 (593  $\Omega$ ), which is consistent with the order of Tafel slopes and electrocatalytic activity (Fig. 4F). Therefore, the enhanced MOR electrocatalytic activity on NiO NTs-400 can be attributed to a large ECSA, the fast catalytic kinetics, and a small  $R_{ct}$ .

#### Electrocatalytic activity of NiO NTs-400 for the intermediates of MOR and activity enhancement mechanism

During the MOR process in alkaline solution, methanol will be gradually oxidized to the final product, carbon dioxide, and both formaldehyde and formate may be intermediates. Therefore, investigating the electrooxidation behavior of formaldehyde and formate on catalysts is helpful to understand the corresponding MOR activity. The formaldehyde and potassium formate oxidation reactions (FOR and PFOR) on NiO NTs-400 and NiO NPs-400 were tested in 1 M KOH + 0.5 M formaldehyde and 1 M KOH + 0.5 M potassium formate solution by CV, respectively. The recorded CV curves show that  $j_{1.5v}$  of FOR and PFOR on NiO NTs-400 is 16.5 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> and 5.3 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, which is 7.2 times and 9.8 times higher than that on NiO NPs-400 (2.3 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> and 0.54 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>), respectively (Fig. 5A and B). In addition, the MOR, FOR, PFOR activity on NiO NTs-400 is gradually reduced, indicating that methanol can be oxidized stepwise to carbon dioxide by NiO NTs-400

(Fig. 5B). However, the FOR activity on NiO NPs-400 is superior to their MOR activity (Fig. 5B). This result reveals that it is difficult to oxidize methanol to formaldehyde on NiO NPs-400, which restricts the MOR activity. In contrast, the intrinsic activity for the MOR has greatly improved on NiO NTs-400.

To explain this breakthrough, defects and fine structures of NiO NTs-400 were investigated by EPR and HR-TEM. The EPR spectrum can sensitively detect unpaired electrons in the sample, which in turn reflects the vacancy defect. 61-63 However, the recorded EPR spectra of NiO NTs-400 and NiO NPs-400 do not show typical symmetry signals, revealing that neither NiO NTs-400 nor NiO NPs-400 contains vacancy defects (Fig. 5C). 61-63 Fortunately, the HR-TEM analysis reveals some critical structural information. Unlike the perfect continuous lattice of NiO NPs-400, the HR-TEM image of NiO NTs-400 shows abundant grain boundaries and atomic steps (Fig. 5D and S7†). The SAED pattern of NiO NTs-400 also shows the discrete dot-ring, revealing a polycrystalline structure (Fig. S8†). In particular, grain boundaries usually have lots of distorted atoms with altered electronic structures that exhibit special catalytic activity.<sup>64</sup> For atomic steps, their coordinating-unsaturated atoms can form stronger adsorption with reactants (i.e., methanol) and activate them, thus enhancing the catalytic activity. 65,66 Therefore, besides the 1D porous hollow structures, rich non-vacancy defects have also made important contributions to improving the electrocatalytic activity of NiO NTs-400 for the MOR.

#### Electrocatalytic durability of NiO NTs-400 for the MOR

The electrocatalytic stability of materials is also a crucial criterion for evaluating their MOR performances. Chronoamperometry tests of the MOR on NiO NTs-400 and NiO NPs-400 were carried out in 1 M KOH + 0.5 M methanol solution with an applied potential of 1.5 V for 10000 s. Compared with NiO NPs-400, the recorded curves on NiO NTs-400 exhibits higher current and slower decay, demonstrating the enhanced electrocatalytic stability of NiO NTs-400 (Fig. 6A). The SEM image indicates that NiO NTs-400 still maintains a 1D hollow structure after the chronoamperometry test (Fig. 6B). Therefore, the superior structural stability of NiO NTs-400 is responsible for good electrocatalytic stability.

### Conclusion

In summary, we developed a Ni(DMG)2 complex-assisted selftemplate method and successfully applied to the synthesis of gram-grade NiO NTs. The pyrolysis temperature of the Ni (DMG)<sub>2</sub> complex determines the morphology and crystallinity of NiO nanostructures. Among them, NiO NTs-400 exhibit the best MOR electrocatalytic activity, benefiting from a large ECSA, the fast catalytic kinetics, and a small  $R_{ct}$ . Compared with NiO NPs-400, the enhanced MOR activity of NiO NTs-400 has been proved to be induced by their superior 1D porous hollow structure and rich non-vacancy defects. In addition, NiO NTs-400 also have an excellent electrocatalytic stability for the MOR due to the superior structural stability, indicating costeffective and robust anodic electrocatalysts for ADMFCs.

# **Optimizing the Size of Rhodium Nanoparticles to Accelerate Alkaline Methanol Oxidation Reaction**

*Yan Guo and Xili Tong\**

**Effectively designing highly efficient and durable electrocatalysts toward the alkaline methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) is of significance for the development of commercial direct methanol fuel cells. However, the choice of Pt-free catalysts is highly pursued to overcome the relatively low activity and stability of Pt nanomaterials for the MOR. In this issue, Rhodium (Rh) nanoparticles dispersed on carbon support with controllable sizes are prepared by a versatile solvothermal synthesis via the CoP bridge to act as a promising candidate alternative to Pt. The Rh nanoparticles exhibited a size effect for the MOR, and the one with the average size of ≈2.83 nm showed exceptional mass activity of 609 mA mg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> due to the fast electronic transfer and efficient active surface area, far surpassing most of the reported Rh-based catalysts. In addition, this Rh catalyst displayed significantly enhanced anti-CO poison ability compared to commercial Pt/C.**

#### **1. Introduction**

Direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs) have played an important role in model energy conversion technology due to their unique advantages, including high energy density, convenient transportation, and low pollution.[\[1\]](#page-6-0) Unfortunately, the sluggish reaction kinetics of the methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) in the anode severely hinders the commercialization of DMFCs.[\[2–4\]](#page-6-0) Although Pt-based materials are considered state-of-the-art MOR electrocatalysts, the high oxidation potential and easy poisoning by CO-related intermediates lead to the fast deterioration of catalytic performance.[\[5–7\]](#page-6-0) Therefore, the development of Pt-free MOR catalysts with high performance is of great significance but a great challenge.

Recently, Rhodium (Rh) has attracted attention based on its brilliant oxygen affinity to promote the adsorption of OH species compared with Pt, which is very beneficial for dehydrogenation

in the MOR as well as CO removal.[\[8–12\]](#page-6-0) For example, hierarchical porous Rh nanosheets (HP-Rh NSs) exhibited a mass activity of 333 A g<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> at 0.63 V, which is 5.8 times higher than that of commercial Pt black (57.4 A g<sup>−</sup>1).[\[13\]](#page-6-0) However, due to the high cost and low mass activity of Rh, it is crucial to further improve the MOR activity and atomic utilization for the Rh-based electrocatalysts. In this respect, the simple and controllable preparation of highly active Rh nanomaterials is still very desirable. In general, the electrocatalytic process is closely related to the surface of the catalysts. Enlarging the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) by modulating the particle size is a straightforward strategy to improve intrinsic catalytic activity

and decrease the cost.[\[14,15\]](#page-6-0) When the size of the nanoparticles is reduced to the nanoscale, even to the single-atom atom-level, the proportion of highly electrochemically active crystal planes would decrease significantly, which results in the decline of catalytic activity.[\[16–18\]](#page-6-0) Furthermore, too small a size may cause the nanoparticles to aggregate or dissolve, resulting in a serious deterioration. On the other hand, the large particle size would reduce the effective active atom quantity of catalysts, thus playing an adverse role in catalytic activity. Therefore, it is crucial to precisely regulate the size of Rh nanoparticles and investigate their influence on the methanol oxidation.

In this present work, Rh nanoparticles (Rh NPs) uniformly dispersed on carbon support were successfully synthesized through the induction of CoP as the medium, in which CoP provided the nucleation site of Rh3<sup>+</sup> ions. The size of Rh NPs was precisely regulated by the addition ratio of Rh3<sup>+</sup> and Co2<sup>+</sup> precursors. Electrochemical measurements suggested Rh NPs exhibited the volcano-plot size effect toward the MOR, and Rh NPs with the particle size of ≈2.83 nm exhibited a remarkable MOR performance, which surpassed the MOR activity of most reported Rh nanoparticles,[\[19–21\]](#page-6-0) even exhibited a superior overpotential to classic Pt-based catalysts.[\[22–24\]](#page-6-0)

## **2. Results and Discussion**

#### **2.1. Synthesis and Structural Characterization of Catalysts**

Size-controllable Rh NPs were synthesized by a simple solvothermal synthesis coupled with a calcination method, as shown in **Scheme 1**[.](#page-1-0) In the first step, Co was directly deposited on carbon

support using NaBH4 as a reducing agent, also called as Co/C. Then, CoP/C was obtained by a simple phosphating treatment for the Co/C. Finally, Rh NPs uniformly grew on the surface of CoP/C, in which CoP acted as the nucleation site of Rh3<sup>+</sup> but disappeared by oxidation and dissolution at high temperature. The carbon supported Rh NPs with different particle sizes were prepared by regulating the mass ratio of Co2<sup>+</sup>/Rh<sup>3</sup><sup>+</sup> to be 5, 3, and 1, which were named as Rh-1/C, Rh-2/C, and Rh-3/C, respectively.

The morphology and structure of the samples were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As evidenced by the TEM image, cobalt phosphides (CoP) nanoparticles were loaded on the surface of carbon support (**Figure 1**a). High resolution TEM (HRTEM) image of the CoP/C (Figure 1b) indicated several typical lattice fringe spacings, in which the lattice distances of 0.247, 0.254, and 0.283 nm correspond to the (111), (200), and (011) planes of CoP, respectively. When Rh was directly loaded on carbon support, the nanoparticles appeared to be agglomerated (Figure S1a, Supporting Information). Interestingly, when the CoP/C was used as an active site for the deposition of Rh<sup>3</sup><sup>+</sup>, the acquired Rh NPs would exhibit a small

size and uniform distribution on carbon support (Figure [1c;](#page-1-0) Figure S1b,c, Supporting Information). In addition, these NPs presented 0.219 nm of the lattice spacing of Rh (111), verifying the successful synthesis of the Rh NPs (Figure [1d\)](#page-1-0). Note that the size of Rh NPs can be modulated by changing the feed mass ratio of Co(CH3COO)2·4H2O and RhCl3·3H2O.

The statistical histograms of 100 nanoparticles measured in the TEM random regions showed that average diameters of the Rh-1/C, Rh-2/C, Rh-3/C, and Rh/C samples were 1.44 ± 0.25, 2.83 ± 0.41, 8.96 ± 1.08, and 16.97 ± 2.07 nm and with a narrow size distribution, respectively (**Figure 2**), indicating the addition amount of CoP plays a key role in controlling the size on carbon support. The element composition of different samples was evaluated by the energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) (Figure S2, Supporting Information). Co and P elements only occurred in Rh-1/C, and the content of CoP was less than 3.3% in mass, attributed to the higher Co2<sup>+</sup>/Rh<sup>3</sup><sup>+</sup> feed ratio. As a result, CoP had almost disappeared for Rh catalysts except Rh-1/C. Based on the EDS analysis, the Rh loading amounts of Rh-1/C, Rh-2/C, Rh-3/C, and Rh/C catalysts were calculated to 9, 13, 24, and 25 wt.%, respectively. In addition, the loading amounts of Rh for these catalysts were further evaluated by using an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES), and the Rh contents were 11.26, 14.03, 21.40, and 18.02 wt.%, respectively.

The crystalline phases of the samples were further examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD). As shown in **Figure 3**[a,](#page-3-0) the XRD pattern of the CoP/C exhibited characteristic diffraction peaks of CoP (JCPDS No. 29–0497).[\[25\]](#page-6-0) As for Rh-n/C samples, their spectra were all similar to that of the Rh/C sample (Figure [3b\)](#page-3-0). Specifically, the representative diffraction peak at ≈24.5° was attributed to (110) graphitic plane of the carbon support.[\[26\]](#page-6-0) Between 30° to 90°, the peaks of the Rh-2/C at 41.1°, 47.8°, 69.9°, and 84.4° were assigned to the cubic Rh (111), (200), (220), and (311) planes (JCPDS No. 05–0685), respectively.[\[27\]](#page-6-0) These data were highly consistent with the above TEM results. Moreover, Raman spectra of CoP/C and carbon black were displayed in Figure S3 (Supporting Information). It can be seen that two bands appear at 1342 and 1588 cm<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> corresponding to the D band and G band, respectively. The degree of disorder in the CoP/C was calculated by the intensity of the D and G bands.[\[28\]](#page-6-0) The intensity ratio of ID/IG was 1.01 for CoP/C, larger than that of the pristine carbon black (0.92), illustrating that the degree of carbon defects was significantly enhanced after loading CoP nanoparticles. X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) was further used to analyze the surface electronic states of samples. The survey spectrum exhibited the presence of Rh, C, and O in the Rh-1/C, Rh-2/C, Rh-3/C, and Rh/C samples (Figure [3c\)](#page-3-0). As shown in Figure [3d,](#page-3-0) the Rh 3d spectra of all samples showed the binding energies of Rh0, Rh3<sup>+</sup>, and satellite peaks were located at 307.7/312.5 eV, 308.5/313.5 eV and 310.4/315.4 eV, respectively,[\[29\]](#page-6-0) indicating that there was no observed change in the surface electronic state for these Rh samples.

#### **2.2. Electrocatalytic Methanol Oxidation**

The catalytic performance for the MOR was further detected in alkaline media. Based on the cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of Rh-2/C and its counterparts (**Figure 4**[a\)](#page-4-0), the specific

<span id="page-3-0"></span>**Figure 3.** XRD patterns of the CoP/C (a), Rh-1/C, Rh-2/C, Rh-3/C, and Rh/C b) samples. XPS survey spectra c) and Rh 3d XPS spectra d) of the Rh-1/C, Rh-2/C, Rh-3/C, and Rh/C samples.

electrochemical surface areas (ECSAs) were measured through the hydrogen absorption-desorption regions in the forward scanning from the CV profiles.[\[30\]](#page-6-0) Thus, the ECSA values of the Rh-1/C, Rh-2/C, Rh-3/C, and Rh/C were calculated to 41, 52, 36, and 26 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>−</sup>1, respectively (Figure [4b\)](#page-4-0). The highest ECSA value of Rh-2/C was attributed to its optimal Rh size with a more appropriate surface structure. The surface of Rh-1/C with the smallest size may be covered by the residual CoP, which made the ECSA smaller. From the CVs for MOR measurements, all samples exhibited similar plots except Rh-1/C, which showed the additional oxidation peaks of CoP at ≈1.04 V versus RHE. In addition, the mass activity of Rh-2/C was 609 mA mg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> on the basis of the peak current density based on the ICP result, which was 1.6, 1.7, and 2.7 times larger than that of Rh-1/C (375 mA mg<sup>−</sup>1), Rh-3/C (356 mA mg<sup>−</sup>1), and Rh/C (223 mA mg<sup>−</sup>1), respectively (Figure [4c\)](#page-4-0), verifying the greater Rh utilization efficiency of Rh-2/C catalyst and surpassing the MOR activity of most reported Rh-based catalysts (Table S1, Supporting Information). Notably, the specific activity of pure CoP/C was further tested (Figure S4, Supporting Information), which exhibited a much lower current density and a more positive oxidation peak compared to these Rh-based catalysts; thus, the influence of CoP in Rh-1/C on the MOR performance could be negligible. When the activity was normalized by the ECSA (Figure [4d\)](#page-4-0), the corresponding specific activity of Rh-2/C was 1.17 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2, still larger than the Rh-1/C (0.91 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2), Rh-3/C (0.99 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2), and

Rh/C (0.86 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2), manifesting its highest potential intrinsic activity.

To investigate the kinetics of MOR, CV curves at different scan rates were obtained. As the scan rate increased, the mass activity significantly increased, and the peak potential was negatively shifted (Figure S5, Supporting Information). By plotting the square root of the scan rate (*v*1/2) and the peak mass activity (**Figure 5**[a\)](#page-5-0), it was observed that all samples showed a positive linear relationship, confirming that the MOR process followed the diffusion-controlled mechanism.[\[31–33\]](#page-6-0) It's worth noting that Rh-2/C had a higher slope value of 0.052 compared to Rh-1/C (0.027), Rh-3/C (0.026), and Rh/C (0.013), revealing the great improvement of MOR kinetics. Additionally, the difference in electrocatalytic reaction kinetics was further studied by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). As depicted in Figure [5b,](#page-5-0) the Nyquist plot revealed that the Rh-2/C catalyst had the lowest charge transfer resistance (*R*ct) of 658 Ω in comparison with Rh-1/C (687 Ω), Rh-3/C (763 Ω), and Rh/C (1660 Ω) catalysts, demonstrating a superior charge transfer ability and thus enhancing the MOR kinetics. In addition, the reaction pathway was analyzed by the rotating disk electrode (RDE) method. As shown in Figure S6 (Supporting Information), no obvious current change was observed between the stationary and rotating state for the Rh-2/C and Rh/C catalysts, indicating the MOR process followed a CO pathway, thus CO2 could be speculated as the main product.[\[34\]](#page-6-0)

Rh mass normalized CV curves c) and ECSA normalized CV curves d) of catalysts in 1.0 M KOH with 1.0 M CH3OH at 50 mV s<sup>−</sup>1.

To assess the CO antipoisoning capability during the methanol oxidation process for practical application, the CO stripping experiments were executed. As shown in Figure [5c,](#page-5-0) the peak potential of the commercial Pt/C toward CO oxidation was 0.70 V, while the Rh-2/C catalyst obviously decreased the peak potential to 0.62 V, demonstrating that the Rh-2/C can obviously promote the electro-oxidative removal of CO and thus lead to a better capability of CO resistance.[\[35,36\]](#page-6-0) In addition to the high intrinsic catalytic activity, long-term stability was also indispensable for the practical application of MOR electrocatalysts. The electrocatalytic durability of the as-prepared catalysts was first evaluated through multiple CVs test (Figures S7 and S8, Supporting Information). The Rh-2/C catalyst remained the highest in the forward scan peak mass activity after 500 CVs than its counterparts, which was attributed to the excellent CO resistance as well as the appropriate size producing better comprehensive effect toward the interaction between Rh NPs and carbon support to reduce Rh dissolution. The MOR durability was further measured by chronoamperometric curves at a fixed potential of 0.6 V for 4000 s (Figure [5d\)](#page-5-0). At the end of the test, the mass activity of the Rh-2/C catalyst was markedly higher than that of the Rh-1/C, Rh-3/C, and Rh/C catalysts, proving its significant increase in stability. In addition, the stability of the Rh-2/C catalyst was also tested by the *i–t* curve coupling multiple CVs scanning as the reactivation step. As shown in Figure S9 (Supporting Information), the mass activity of the Rh-2/C catalyst was reduced in the first 800 s. Note that the mass activity rapidly recovered to the initial activity after a reactivation. After five continuous i-t tests for 800 s, combining with the reactivation process, the mass activity of Rh-2/C catalyst was well maintained and even slightly improved, which revealed that the decrease of its activity may be due to the surface poisoning of Rh. The nanoparticles of Rh-2/C were basically uniformly dispersed, and the particle size was slightly larger (2.97 ± 0.40 nm) after the stability test (Figure S10, Supporting Information), which could be attributed to the Ostwald ripening effect.

#### **3. Conclusion**

In summary, Rh NPs were uniformly loaded on carbon support with a high dispersion via CoP bridge in solvothermal synthesis, and their particle sizes were adjusted by the addition of mass of precursors. These samples exhibited the size effect toward the MOR, and the Rh-2/C with the particle size of ≈2.83 nm showed a much better activity for MOR relative to the Rh-1/C, Rh-3/C, and Rh/C catalysts, also outperforming most recently reported Rh-based catalysts. Furthermore, the Rh-2/C also displayed good stability and CO resistance. This work offers an attractive strategy for controllable synthesizing carbon supported metal nanoparticle catalysts for various applications.

#### **4. Experimental Section**

*Synthesis of Size-Controlled Rh/C Nanoparticles*: 50 mg of carbon support and 75 mg of cobalt (II) acetate tetrahydrate (Co(CH3COO)2·4H2O) were added to a flask containing 20 mL of ethylene glycol (EG) with strong

stirring. When the temperature was raised to 120 °C, 5 mL of 0.1 m sodium borohydride (NaBH4) solution was slowly added. After 1 h of reaction, the mixture was cooled down naturally to room temperature, followed by centrifugation and washing several times with deionized water and ethanol. The product was dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C for 8 h. Subsequently, the product was placed in a tubular furnace for the heat treatment at 300 °C for 2 h in an Ar atmosphere by using NaH2PO2 as the phosphorus source. In the next step, the obtained product and 15 mg rhodium (III) chloride hydrate (RhCl3·nH2O) were added to 20 mL of EG for Rh deposition on the carbon support at 150 °C for 3 h. The final product was obtained by centrifugation and drying, which was denoted as Rh-1/C. Altering the amount ratio of Co(CH3COO)2·4H2O/RhCl3·nH2O to 3:1 and 1:1 while other conditions remain unchanged, Rh-2/C and Rh-3/C were prepared, respectively. For comparison, Rh/C was acquired through directly depositing Rh on carbon support using the same reducing agent.

*Structural Characterization*: Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution (HRTEM) images were obtained on a JEM-2100F. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded by a D8 ADVANCE A25 diffractometer with Cu K radiation in the 2 range from 10° to 90°. Xray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were conducted on a scanning X-ray microprobe with Al K radiation. Raman spectra were measured by the LabRAM HR Evolution Raman instrument with a 532 nm Ar ion laser as the excitation source.

*Electrochemical Measurements*: Before the electrochemical tests, the catalysts need to be processed. First of all, 5 mg of each catalyst was dispersed in a mixture solution composed of 0.5 mL of DI water, 0.5 mL of ethanol, and 20 μL of 5 wt.% Nafion solution. Then, the catalyst ink (5 μL) was dropped on a working electrode and dried at room temperature. Electrochemical investigations were carried out with a CHI 760E electrochemical analyzer (Chenhua Co. Ltd) using a standard three electrode cell, where a glassy carbon electrode (GCE, 5 mm in diameter), a saturated calomel electrode, and a Pt plane were regarded as the working, reference, and counter electrodes, respectively. The electrocatalytic methanol oxidation was operated in 1.0 M KOH and 1.0 M CH3OH mixed solution at a scan rate of 50 mV s<sup>−</sup>1. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) spectra were tested by a Zahner work station at 0.5 V in the frequency range of 100 kHz-0.01 Hz with the amplitude of 5 mV.

The potentials in this study were converted to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) by the following Equation 1:

$$E ext{ (versus RHE)} = E ext{ (versus SCE)} + E_{SCE} ext{ (0.242 V)} + 0.0592 \times pH$$
 (1)

The electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) values of catalysts were estimated by integrating the hydrogen adsorption peaks and calculated based on the following Equation 2: [\[20,21\]](#page-6-0)

$$ECSA = Q_H / (Cm)$$
 (2)

where QH indicates the charge of hydrogen adsorption/desorption, m is the mass of Rh on the electrode, and C represents the hydrogen adsorption constant (CRh = 220 μC cm<sup>−</sup>2).[\[13,9\]](#page-6-0)

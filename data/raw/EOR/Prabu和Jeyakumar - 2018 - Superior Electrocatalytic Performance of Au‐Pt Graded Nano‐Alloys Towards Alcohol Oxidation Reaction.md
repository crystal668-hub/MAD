The electro-oxidation of methanol, ethanol and glycerol on Au100-xPtx/C ('x'=7.0-86) graded nano-alloy modified glassy carbon electrode was investigated at cyclic voltammetry. Prepared Au77Pt23/C alloy showed highest electrocatalytic activity, with mass activity of 572 mAmg <sup>1</sup> of Pt for methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) and high mass activity of 750 mAmg <sup>1</sup> of Pt for ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR). Au69Pt31/C alloy exhibited higher mass activity of 221 mAmg <sup>1</sup> of Pt for glycerol oxidation reaction (GOR). The results indicate that the surface enrichment of Pt in Au100-xPtx/C graded nanoalloy enhanced the alcohol oxidation. We also tested the Au100 xPtx/C anode catalyst for full cell direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC). While using the low amount of Au60Pt40/C anode catalyst (1 mg cm <sup>2</sup> ) in DMFC that exhibited maximum power density of 30 mWcm <sup>2</sup> at 70°C, which is comparable to Pt Ru/ C anode catalyst. This remarkable electro-catalytic performance of Au100-xPtx/C graded nano-alloy will make alternate materials for commercial Pt Ru/C catalysts.

# **Introduction**

Direct alcohol fuel cells (DAFCs) have increased attention in recent years due to low emission, easy availability, simple fabrication and operation.[1–3] Mostly used liquid fuels are small organic molecules such as methanol, ethanol, glycerol and formic acid in DAFCs[4–8] due to high theoretical energy density, easy storage, transportation, and distribution of liquid fuel, and the elimination of fuel reformer and humidifiers.[9–10] Especially, direct methanol fuel cell has only used in portable electronic devices such as a laptop, mobile phone, digital camera, etc.[8–12] It has a theoretical capacity of 6100 Wh/Kg with open cell potential of 1.2 V is 15 times more than a lithium-ion battery.[4] Ethanol and glycerol fuel cells cannot be utilized even they having the same energy density as methanol due to inferior electro-oxidation reaction and extremely low power output.[5] There are also still major unresolved drawbacks with the DAFCs: a poisoning of anode catalyst owing to carbonaceous intermediates[6] and the high energy required for the C C cleavage, mixed potential generation at the cathode due to liquid fuel crossover through Nafion® electrolyte membrane and sluggish reaction kinetics of oxygen reduction reaction. Further it caused to reduce the fuel cell performance to one third of the theoretical value and increase the cost of the DAFCs. Numerous attempts have been made to overcome them. For example, Pt Ru/C catalyst has been found to exhibit high electrocatalytic activities towards the methanol oxidation reaction (MOR).[7–10] It has noted that abundance of Ru is scarce on Earth's crust[11,12] and sluggish MOR. The structural effects of Pt Ru has also influence the efficiency of the MOR.[13,14] Hence, usage of more abundant elements with enhanced efficiency towards alcohol oxidation reaction kinetics and effective utilization of Pt are necessary. In this case replacement of Ru to some other elements with the specific properties of less OH adsorption potential and less affinity to carbonaceous products like CO, CO2 etc.

The detailed description of synthesis and characterization of Au Pt graded nano-alloy NPs of different compositions have been previously published.[15] Detailed analysis of Au Pt NPs formation and its surface characteristics indicates the graded nano-alloy formation and its annealing effects conclude the surface enrichment of Pt during synthesis and phase segregation occurs upon annealing the materials. The surface activation on annealing the materials was not proper way to study the real behaviour of the catalytic nanomaterials. S. Park and their co-workers have reported the formation of vertical arrays of Au hollow nanotubes (NTs) and the fine structures on the wall of Au NTs. These type of materials have high surface area, easy transport of reactants and can be fine-tuned the intrinsic catalytic activities.[16] Various supporting matrix of the nanoparticles are attempted for the efficiency improvement of the catalyst.

H. K. Hassan and their co-workers have attempted different supports like graphene, graphene oxide and reduced graphene oxide matrix for the catalyst preparation and evaluated the performance of the catalyst for MOR.[17] Elena Pastor[18] and their co-workers reported carbon supported Pt electrode towards EOR and the analysis with electrochemical mass spectrometry to confirmed the three different products formed during ethanol oxidation process on Pt surface. Lovic[19] was reported that Pd Ni electrodeposited electrodes was evaluated the performance of methanol and ethanol, the bimetallic material has higher activity than Pd metal in 1 M NaOH electrolyte. Most of the reports deal with half-cell studies only

in alkali electrolyte, especially Pt based transition metal catalysts (Pt Ni, Pt Fe, etc.).[20,21]

Quintero Pulido[22] and their co-workers are studied the Au electrode in the combination of Zn, Cu and Ag metals towards glycerol oxidation reaction in alkaline medium and concluded that the availability of Au with Zn has higher catalytic activity on GOR. Garcia and their co-workers attempted the influence of Bi on Pt sites like decoration of Bi nanoparticles towards glycerol oxidation impacts on the change in the product formation. The Bi surface on Pt(111) has complete shift in the selectivity from glyceraldehyde to dihydroxyacetone as the product on glycerol oxidation process.[23] The alcohol oxidation reaction results in the generation of H<sup>+</sup> at the anode/electrocatalyst interface, which makes these catalysts unstable over a period of time.

Rostami and co-workers[24] attempted Pt Ru catalyst for MOR with 4 M alkaline electrolyte, they concluded half-cell studies are not comparable with the DMFC performance.[25] Surampidi et al.[26] studied the effect of temperature and methanol concentration on liquid feed DMFC. The performances were measured at 30°C, 60°C and 90°C, respectively, and the results showed a remarkable change in performance with increase in temperature. The methanol concentrations of 0.5, 2.0 and 4.0 M were used and the results showed the highest voltage and power density was obtained with 2.0 M methanol. Jung et al. studied the effect of operating temperature (60-120°C) and methanol concentration (0.5-4.0 M) of a single cell DMFC.[27–29]The anode flow rate was 9 ml/min and pure oxygen at a flow rate of 105 sq.cm. They concluded that better DMFC performance achieved at 2.5 M methanol concentration.

This research article aims to evaluate MOR employing Au100 xPtx/C catalysts ('x'=7.0 to 83) by CV studies. It was observed that Au100-xPtx/C, 'x'=23, 31 & 40 were better performance for MOR. It was further evaluated on ethanol and glycerol oxidation reaction. The single cell DMFC performance was studied in Au100-xPtx/C as anode catalyst by varying cell temperature, methanol concentration and flow rate of the methanol.

# **Results and discussion**

The Synthesis and characterization of Au100-xPtx/C materials were already reported by us.[15] Briefly, the protocol involves coreduction of precursors to form Au100-xPtx NPs in aqueous medium which was supported on Vulcan XC-72 carbon. The actual metal loading in the carbon supported catalyst was in the range of 10 wt% for x=7, 14 & 23 and 20 wt% for x=31, 40, 86. Au100-xPtx/C materials have been extensively characterized using spectroscopic and electrochemical methods and the details are reported in the previous publication.[15]

The GC electrode modification with catalyst was explained detail in supporting information. The CVs of as-formed Au100 xPtx/C (10-20 wt% of metal) coated GC electrodes in 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte have been reported and the surface characteristics were discussed at length in our earlier publication. The relative electrochemical surface ratio for Au100-xPtx/C was calculated from Au O and Pt O reduction peaks and was observed the following, with increase in x values amount of Pt on the surface get increased. There was surface excess of Pt with increase in x values, when x *>*40 the surface is predominantly Pt.

## **Electrochemical oxidation of methanol on Au100-xPtx/C**

The Au100-xPtx/C (10-20 wt% of metal) coated GC electrodes were evaluated on MOR with 0.5 M methanol in 0.5 M H2SO4 as a background electrolyte. Commercial Pt/C (20 wt%) was also studied for comparative purpose. The CVs obtained for MOR using Au100-xPtx/C ('x'=7.0, 14, 23, 31, 40, 51, 62, 73 and 86) catalysts coated electrodes are presented in Figure S1.

The Figure 1 shows that during the forward scan methanol oxidation takes place at around 0.268 V and the reverse scan also oxidation takes place at around 0.089 V *vs.* MMS reference electrode. This behaviour is well established for MOR on Pt surface (in Pt/C as well as Pt Ru/C electro-catalyst).[30] The forward oxidation peak is due to the oxidation of methanol and the reverse current is attributed to the oxidation of adsorbed carbonaceous species.

The methanol oxidation activity of Au69Pt31/C material with different concentration of methanol in 0.5 M H2SO4 as background electrolyte was shown in Figure S2. The peak current was increases when increasing the methanol concentration, the oxidation potential was slightly increases to the positive direction when increasing the concentration of the methanol. A perusal of figure1 reveals the following, When 'x'=7.0, the methanol oxidation current is not clearly seen, the methanol oxidation activity was influenced by the Electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) ratio of the Au100-xPtx/C material.

The Au93Pt7/C material has rich Au surface, (87.87%) and Pt (12.13%). It is well established that Au surface is a poor catalytic surface for MOR.[31] Hence, MOR was not clearly seen for this material. However, for Au86Pt14/C the electrochemical active surface area of Pt has increased to 22.5% and the methanol oxidation peak was found to increase significantly. With the increase in the 'x' values, the methanol oxidation peak current values were found to increase. In the case of Au77Pt23/C dramatic increase in MOR was observed as evidenced from the higher current values.

The increase in the oxidation peak current is more than four times than that observed for Au86Pt14/C material. This is due to the increase in Pt ECSA by three times than Au86Pt14/C. Subsequently, with the increase in the 'x' values that Pt surface coverage is nearly 100% and hence, the increase in the methanol oxidation current values was not found to be proportional with amount of Pt in the NPs. There was marginal increase in the oxidation current values for 'x'=31, 40 & 51 after increasing 'x' values the MOR peak current value decreased marginally (Figure 1). It is pertinent to point out that the peak current value for methanol oxidation using commercial Pt/C is lower than Au100-xPtx/C ('x'=23, 31 & 40), indicating the synergistic effect towards MOR over Au Pt surface. The specific concentration of Au available on the surface was improves the methanol oxidation catalytic active sites in the Au Pt materials. This is further manifested in the reduction of

**Figure 1.** MOR current density of Au100-xPtx/C coated on GC electrode using 0.5 M methanol in 0.5 M H2SO4 using MMS as the reference electrode with different 'x' values of (A) 7.0 – 40.0, (a) 7.0, (b) 14, (c) 23, (d) 31, (e) 40, (f) Pt/C (commercial catalyst) (B) 51–86, (g) 51, (h) 62, (i) 73 and (j) 86 [geometric area used for current density].

the reverse peak current (ib), that arises essentially due to the absorbed carbonaceous materials. The surface availability of Au NPs is essential for the conversion of CO to CO2; because of Au has less OH adsorption potential than Pt. These are the main reasons for the MOR activity of the middle composition of the Au100-xPtxmaterials.

It is worthy to point at the juncture that the ratio of forward oxidation peak current (if ) to the reverse oxidation peak current (ib) can be correlated to the poisoning of the catalyst surface.[32] Higher the if/ib value would indicate lowering of poisoning effect.

The if/ib values for all Au100-xPtx/C catalysts were calculated and plotted as a function of 'x' (Figure 2). It can be seen that

**Figure 2.** Peak current and if/ib was plotted against 'x' value.

the if /ib values were *>*1 for Au100-xPtx for 'x'=7.0-32, compared to 'x'=23, but more than that of commercial Pt/C and ∼1 for higher values of 'x'. The ip value and if /ib ratio of Au77Pt23 is around 6.8 inspite of surface excess of Pt. The mass activities of these catalysts were calculated from the methanol oxidation current values and are shown in Figure 3. It can be seen from Figure 3 that the mass activity for MOR is maximum for Au77Pt23/C catalyst followed by Au69Pt31/C and Au60Pt40/C. It may be noted that the oxidation current for MOR is not proportional to the Pt concentration. This observed trend arises due to the surface excess of these materials. The ECSA for these materials are 71.7%, 81.10% and 95.6% respectively. In the case of 'x'= 31 and 40, Pt sublayer materials may not take part in MOR and may be responsible for lower mass activities when compared to Au77Pt23/C. Similar trend has been observed for 'x'=51 to 86 where the surface coverage Pt ∼100% and the same trend for'x' =100, Pt/C catalyst as well, due to non-contribution inactive sublayer of Pt towards MOR. The if /ib values were also found to increase with decreasing 'x' values.

The mass activity of MOR was found to be maximum for 'x'=23. This is due to the maximum coverage of Pt on the surface (∼ 75%) for 23% content of Pt in the catalyst. Subsequently, the mass activity decreased for 'x'=31, 40 and 51 when catalyst. This observation is also due to enriched Pt on the surface. Hence, the utilization of Pt towards MOR is higher than Pt/C commercial material. In the commercial Pt/C material the core Pt atoms do not contribute to MOR and hence the mass activity per mg of Pt was found to be lower than 'x'=23, 31, 40 and 51.

The enhanced mass activities for 'x'=23, 31 & 40 along with less poisoning for MOR essentially arise due to the synergistic effect of Au & Pt in Au100-xPtx/C catalyst. It may be noted that relative abundance of Au on the surface in Au100 xPtx/C material decreased with the increase in the 'x' value. For 'x'=23, 28% of Au is present and is decreased to 19.0% & 4.4%

**Figure 3.** MOR mass activity of Au100-xPtx/C coated on GC electrode using 0.5 M methanol in 0.5 M H2SO4 using MMS as the reference electrode with different 'x' values (A) 7.0–40.0, (a) 7.0, (b) 14, (c) 23, (d) 31, (e) 40, (f) Pt/C (Hi-spec 20 wt%) (B) 51–86, (g) 51, (h) 62, (i) 73 and (j) 86.

for 'x'=31 and 40 respectively. Hence, the if /ib value changes from 6.8 to 2.9 and 2.4 for 'x'=23, 31 & 40 respectively. Then for higher 'x' values of 'x' *>*51 the value is at around 1.0 as in the case of commercial Pt/C catalyst. J. Zhang and co-workers [33,34] has synthesized nanoporous gold decorated with different concentration of Pt and confirms the surface excess of Pt with minimum amount of Au resulted in similar behaviour. The availability of surface Au plays the role of improvement in the if /ib ratio.

It is well established that Au and Pt in have miscibility gap in bulk, but in nanoscale formation of nano-alloy have been reported and in the present case graded nano-alloy formation.[35–38] However, on thermal annealing migration of Pt from Surface to core and Au from core takes place. This results in Au enriched surface as Pt has migrated to the core. At higher temperature, ie. 600°C the process continued leading to phase segregation of Au&Pt crystallites. This has been confirmed from XRD data of the sample annealed at 600°C. The peak at around 38.4° observed for as-formed product was found to split into two peaks corresponding to Au and Pt lines. Similarly the other peaks were also found to split/broaden depending on the 'x' values. For intermittent 'x' values the split was prominent.

The relative electrochemical surface ratio of Au & Pt for 'x'= 23, 31, 40 & 51 in as-formed and annealed at 250°C, 400°C & 600°C are clearly seen that the relative ECSA ratio of Pt decreased on annealing and extend of decrease depends on the 'x' value. The changes in ECSA ratio with respect to 'x' values are explained in detail are shown in the previous publication.[15]

Au100-xPtx/C materials ('x'=23, 31 & 40) annealed at 250°C, 400°C and 600°C were employed for electrochemical MOR. CVs obtained for the electrochemical MOR ofAu100-xPtx/C materials for 'x'=23, 31 respectively. A closure examination of Figure 4 reveals that the peak current values decreased gradually for Au77Pt23/C material. It may be noted that the current values for the reverse peak also decrease sequentially. The current value for [Au77Pt23/C]600° <sup>C</sup> was incidentally found to be comparable to that obtained for [Au86Pt14/C]as-formed, both of which have similar ECSA of Pt.

Similarly, in the case of Au69Pt31/C material annealed also exhibit similar behaviour. The peak current values of MOR decrease with increase in annealing temperature. It may be noted that the peak current value of [Au69Pt31]250 ° <sup>C</sup> is almost similar to [Au77Pt23]as-formed shown in Figure 5. This may be attributed to ECSA of Pt of both these samples are similar. In this case also the reverse oxidation current values were also found to decrease with the increase in the annealing temperature. Hence, the synergistic effect between the Au & Pt centres is the reason for lower poisoning effect in these materials. In contrast, the decreases in the MOR current value suggest that Pt centres are the catalytic centres for MOR in Au100-xPtx/C materials.

In the same way Au60Pt40/C material annealed at different temperatures (Figure 6) also follows similar trend as 'x'=23 and 31 materials. The MOR activity was decreased significantly, the peak current was 50–60% decrease from as-formed to 250°C heat-treated materials. The extreme change in the peak current was because of the decrease in the surface concentration of Pt on annealing. The ECSA values of [Au69Pt31]400 and [Au60Pt40]600 are more or less equal. But the peak current values are two third decreases in [Au60Pt40]600 because, in the case of 600°C annealed material the surface Pt centers are less catalytic centers. The annealed materials of higher 'x' values are having less Pt catalytic centers in the surface. In this case also the reverse oxidation current values were also found to decrease with the increase in the annealing temperature. Hence, the synergistic effect between the Au & Pt centres is the reason for lower poisoning effect in these materials.

The higher 'x' values of 'x'=62, 73 and 86 also follows the same trend of annealed materials MOR. Au100-xPtx NPs ('x'=23, 31 and 40) were found to be an efficient catalysts for MOR.

Hence, these materials have been evaluated for their catalytic oxidation on ethanol and glycerol.

#### **Electrochemical oxidation of ethanol on Au100-xPtx/C**

Au100-xPtx/C ('x'=23, 31 and 40) modified electrode were studied using 0.5 M ethanol and 0.5 M H2SO4 as background electrolyte. The CVs are presented in figure 7 along with that obtained for commercial Pt/C catalyst.

It can be seen from the Figure 7, there are two prominent oxidation peaks at around 0.28 V and 0.64 V *vs.* MMS for all these catalysts as well as Pt/C material. During the reverse scan there is an oxidation peak are around 0.1 V *vs.* MMS. These peaks correspond to the oxidation of ethanol to acetaldehyde and further oxidation to acetic acid. Further, the current values for the oxidation vary as Au69Pt31/C *>* Au77Pt23/C *>* Au60Pt40/C *>* Pt/C. It can be noted that Pt/C has the lowest peak current value when compared to the other materials suggest that Au Pt centres have synergistic effect towards EOR. These centres are responsible for the reduction in the reverse peak current arising from the carbonaceous intermediates as in the case of MOR studies.

Theoretically ethanol can be oxidized completely to H2O and CO2 through 12e process.[39]

$$\mathsf{CH_3CH_2OH} \rightarrow \ \mathsf{CH_x} + \ \mathsf{CO} \ \rightarrow \ \mathsf{CO_2} + \ \mathsf{12e^-} = \mathsf{12e^-}$$

However unlike methanol oxidation, ethanol oxidation involves C C bond cleavage. Hence, complete oxidation of ethanol will not take place on Pt surface. The most accepted mechanism of EOR is through acetaldehyde and then acetic

Figure 6. MOR of  $Au_{60}Pt_{40}/C$  coated on GC electrode using 0.5 M methanol in 0.5 M  $H_2SO_4$  using MMS as the reference electrode with different annealing temperatures (A) without methanol (B) with methanol.

$$CH_3CH_2OH

ightarrow CH_3COOH + 2e^- + 2Hetharpel- to acetic acid through acetaldehyde on Pt centers.$$

However, Antolini and co-workers have reported that EOR stops at acetaldehyde formation.  $^{[40]}$  To confirm this oxidation of acetaldehyde and acetic acid were carried out using  $Au_{77}Pt_{23}/C$  catalyst (Figure 8). It can be seen that acetaldehyde undergoes oxidation at around 0.220 V vs. MMS in 0.5 M  $H_2SO_4$ . This peak is similar to that observed for EOR. Further, there are peaks at around 0.54 V & 0.76 V essentially arising due to Au–O and Pt–O formation. In the reverse direction there are peaks at around 0.45 V and -0.05 V vs. MMS that arise due to the reduction of Au–O and Pt–O formed during the forward scan. In addition, there in reverse oxidation peak at around -0.1 V

similar to that observed for EOR. This suggests that the first peak observed during EOR, probably arises the conversion of wethanal to acetic acid through acetaldehyde on Pt centers.

When acetic acid was used instead of acetaldehyde<sup>[41]</sup> the prominent peak at around 0.2 V was not present. The other peaks corresponding to formation of Au—O, Pt—O and reduction peaks were observed. The reverse oxidation peak is also not seen, suggesting acetic acid is not further oxidised. These observations suggest EOR lead to the formation of acetic acid.

The mass activity of electrochemical EOR was shown in Figure 9. Au<sub>77</sub>Pt<sub>23</sub>/C material was higher peak current of 750 mA mg<sup>-1</sup> of Pt, after that decreased with increasing the 'x' value. It is well established that gold centres do not oxidize ethanol. However, the electrochemical studies indicate gold centers in Au<sub>100-x</sub>Pt<sub>x</sub>/C contribute to EOR as seen from the mass activity. The commercial Pt/C material also following same

mechanism of Au100-xPtx/C material and the current values were much lower compared to Au100-xPtx/C materials. This is due to the inert sub-surface Pt's non-contribution of EOR.

#### **Electrochemical oxidation of glycerol on Au100-xPtx/C**

The chemical name of glycerol is 1, 2, 3 – trihydroxy propane and is available in plenty as a by-product in soap industries.[42] The electrochemical oxidation of glycerol is not well established. Schnaidt co-workers have studied the oxidation of glycerol by in-situ IR spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry.[43] More than10 products have been identified during GOR. As in the case of ethanol complete oxidation is seldom feasible.[44] GOR was carried out electrochemically using Au77Pt23/C, Au69Pt31/C and Au60Pt40/C materials coated on GC electrode. Typically 0.25 M glycerol in 0.5 M H2SO4 was used. The CVs are provided in Figure 10, glycerol undergoes oxidation at around

**Figure 10.** Mass activity of glycerol oxidation reaction of Au100-xPtx/C coated on GC electrode using 0.25 M glycerol in 0.5 M H2SO4 using MMS as the reference electrode with different x values (a) 23, (b) 31, (c) 40, (d) Pt/C.

0.22 V for Au77Pt23/C material during the forward scan and during the reverse scan it gave raise to oxidation at around 0.03 V vs. MMS reference electrode. When the Pt content was more, the oxidation peak shifted to lower potentials at around 0.18 V and 0.16 V vs. MMS for Au69Pt31/C and Au60Pt40/C materials respectively. The reverse peak was very broad and the shift is significantly not seen. Pt/C material gave raise to the GOR peak at around 0.15 V and the reverse peak at around 0.1 V vs. MMS.[26] The Au69Pt31/C was higher mass activity of 221 mAmg <sup>1</sup> Pt, and decreases with increase in 'x' values (Figure 10).

## **DMFC performance of Au100-xPtx/C materials**

Membrane electrode assembly (MEA) was fabricated using pretreated[37,38] Nafion® membrane sandwiched with catalyst coated electrodes detailed procedure of MEA fabrication was showed in supporting information Au100-xPtx/C ('x'=23, 31 & 40) as catalyst for MOR (anode catalyst) and commercial Pt/C for oxygen reduction (cathode catalyst). The catalyst loading in the anode side was 1.0 mg Pt cm <sup>2</sup> and 2.0 mg Pt cm <sup>2</sup> for the cathode with parallel flow field for anode and serpentine flow field for cathode. Gold coated copper plates were used as current collector. The catalyst coated GDLs (anode and cathode) were placed on either side of Nafion® 117 membrane and hot-pressed at 120°C in 20 Kg cm <sup>2</sup> load. The MEA thus obtained was assembled in 4.0 cm<sup>2</sup> DMFC single stack. Methanol (2.0 M) was passed through the anode compartment at a flow rate 2.0 mlmin <sup>1</sup> and cathode side with oxygen at 300 mlmin <sup>1</sup> . The cell was allowed to equilibrate for one hour and kept on standby for activation of the catalyst. After activation, fuel cell performance was evaluated at varying operation temperature and methanol concentration. It is pertinent to note that 2.0 mlmin <sup>1</sup> of methanol solution flow has been reported to be the optimal flow rate and hence the same was used in this study.

The cell was discharged from OCV to 100 mV and discharge process was repeated for five cycles. The cell was operated at 50°C, 60°C & 70°C (� 2.0°C). The complete assembly of the cell and other setup for the performance evaluation was showed in Figure 11. The DMFC performance of Au100-xPtx/C ('x'=23, 31 & 40) at different temperature (60 & 70°C was shown in Figure 12.

When methanol concentration was 2.0 M at a flow rate of 2.0 ml/min at 60°C, the Voc of the cell was found to be 0.630 V. During evaluation, initially there was a sudden drop of the potential for lower current load due to activation controlled process. Then there was slow decrease of cell voltage as the current load was increased. The current density at 100 mV cell voltage was Au77Pt23/C *<* Au69Pt31/C *<* Au60Pt40/C at 75 mAcm <sup>2</sup> , 165 mAcm <sup>2</sup> and 185 mAcm <sup>2</sup> respectively. The power outputs were calculated and are provided in Table 1.

However, in the case of cell performance at 70°C, the current density at 100 mV was Au77Pt23/C *<* Au60Pt40/C *<* Au69Pt31/C. The power output values have been improved at 70°C when compared to 60°C, indicating the performance is better at 70°C.

In both operating temperature 'x'=23 was lower performance of 8.0 mWcm <sup>2</sup> and16 mWcm <sup>2</sup> for 60°C & 70°C respectively than 'x'=31 & 40. In 'x'=31 material performance was improving from 16 mW to 22 mWcm <sup>2</sup> on varying operation temperature. The better performance at 70°C may be due to the lowering of the poisoning effect of the catalysts.

The performance of 'x'=40 shows marginal increase in the current density as well as power density of 19.8 mWcm <sup>2</sup> to 20.2 mWcm <sup>2</sup> for 60°C and 70°C. However, it may be noted that among the series 'x'=7.0 to 86, in the half cell studies 'x'= 23 has the best performance for MOR, but the full cell studies 'x'=40 has the maximum power density in 2.0 M methanol concentration and 2.0 mlmin <sup>1</sup> at 70°C. The difference in the performance may be due to the complete utilization of the catalyst in DMFC. The 'x'=23 has the maximum metal loading of 10 wt% in the catalyst, in DMFC test anode loading is 1.0 mg cm <sup>2</sup> . Hence, the thickness of the anode coating was more for Au77Pt23/C material that will affect the utility of the catalyst during MOR process in DMFC. The above results confirmed that 70°C was better operating temperature, so further experiments are performed in 70°C operation temperature.

The methanol concentration inducement the performance of the catalyst, the performance of different concentration of methanol was analysed at 2.0 ml flow rate and 70°C operating temperature and 300 ml/min oxygen flow rate on cathode side. The performance of 'x'=23, 31 and 40 was 18, 22 & 30 mWcm <sup>2</sup> respectively on 3.0 M concentration of methanol, this was fine improvement when compare to 2.0 M methanol. Higher concentration of methanol favours the activity enhancement, because the higher concentration reduces the mass transport loss and to increases the operation time.

The continuous feed of higher concentration of methanol increases the cell temperature, which also enhances the DMFC performance.[6] Upon varying methanol concentration experiments 3.0 M methanol has better performance on 'x'=40 shown in Figure 13.

The comparative study of the catalyst loading and the cell resistance with the cell performance shows the perfect view of the DMFC studies, because the thickness of the catalyst coating in the membrane electrode assembly reflects the cell resistance. The cell resistance was higher the performance was reduced comparatively. Table 2 shows the comparative study

#### **Conclusions**

The  $Au_{100-x}Pt_x/C$  materials of 'x'=23, 31, 40 and 51 were evaluated for MOR, EOR and GOR. The MOR activity of Au<sub>77</sub>Pt<sub>23</sub>/ C materials was performed well compared with commercial Pt/ C catalyst with a mass activity of 560 mA mg<sup>-1</sup> of Pt and i<sub>f</sub>/i<sub>b</sub> ratio of 6.8 in 0.5 M methanol. The heat treated materials of all the four compositions are followed same trend of decrease in MOR activity upon increase in annealing temperature. The EOR results showed that Au<sub>77</sub>Pt<sub>23</sub>/C have higher mass activity of  $750\; mA\, mg^{-1}$  of Pt with less cathodic over potential than commercial Pt/C material in 0.5 M ethanol. The EOR takes place through acetaldehyde pathway, and was confirmed by the individual oxidation of acetaldehyde and acetic acid oxidation with Au<sub>77</sub>Pt<sub>23</sub>/C modified GC electrode. The Au<sub>69</sub>Pt<sub>31</sub>/C material has enhanced catalytic activity than commercial Pt/C catalyst on electrochemical oxidation of glycerol with mass activity of 210 mA mg<sup>-1</sup> of Pt in 0.250 M glycerol. The mechanism of oxidation is not clear at this stage. The MEA were prepared by  $Au_{100-x}Pt_x/C$  of 'x' = 23, 31 & 40 (20 wt%) materials of 1.0 mg loading as anode catalyst and Hi-Spec Pt/C (20 wt%) of 2.0 mg loading as cathode catalyst for evaluating the DMFC performance in different operation conditions. The full cell results confirm that thickness of the catalyst layer also plays a key role on its performance. The power density of  $Au_{60}Pt_{40}/C$  material was 30 mWcm $^{-2}$  in 70 °C, which is similar to commercial Pt–Ru/C catalyst.

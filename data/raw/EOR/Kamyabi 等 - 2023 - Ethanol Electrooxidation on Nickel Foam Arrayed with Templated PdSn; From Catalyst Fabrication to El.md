# Ethanol Electrooxidation on Nickel Foam Arrayed with Templated PdSn; From Catalyst Fabrication to Electrooxidation Dominance Route

Mohammad Ali Kamyabi,\*[a] Salma Jadali,[a] and Taher Alizadeh[b]

In the present work, the performance of templated Pd-based catalysts (TPL.Pd<sub>1</sub>Sn<sub>x</sub>/NF) with different atomic ratio on the alkaline electrooxidation of ethanol was investigated. The superb mass activity (3246.6 mA mg $^{-1}$   $_{\rm Pd}$  compared with 289.9 mA mg $^{-1}$   $_{\rm Pt}$  for state of the art commercial Pt/C) as well as preferable long time stability, anti-poisoning property, and conductivity of the optimum structure (TPL.Pd<sub>1</sub>Sn<sub>20</sub>/NF) towards

electrooxidation of ethanol were proved by electrochemical experiments. The comparative study of electrocatalytic oxidation of acetaldehyde on the surface of TPL.Pd $_1\mathrm{Sn}_{20}/\mathrm{NF}$  and TPL.Pd/NF exhibited that the presence of tin in the structure of TPL.Pd $_1\mathrm{Sn}_{20}/\mathrm{NF}$  not only substantially promoted C1 pathway but also appreciably prevented the aldol condensation and deactivation during the electrooxidation of ethanol.

#### Introduction

The limited availability of fossil fuels and their biological effects, and the global economic crisis demand to embrace the substitute clean energy sources with high efficacy. In this context, fuel cell technologies that produce electricity via chemical energy of a wide range of fuels are generally recognized as the favorite energy sources in many wide range of applications. Traditionally, hydrogen, hydrogen-rich gases, and small organic molecules are widely investigated as a fuel. Ethanol is especially recognized as an appreciable fuel in respect of low toxicity, biochemically production, low or even zero carbon emissions, facile storage and transportation and high theoretical energy density.<sup>[1,2]</sup> Two different pathway are accounted for electrocatalytic oxidation of ethanol that can result in various products including acetaldehyde, acetic acid, and carbon dioxide. The C2 pathway that confronts with lower energy barrier results in acetaldehyde or acetic acid products without C-C bond cleavage [Eqs. (1) and (2)]. The complete oxidation of ethanol with 12 electron transfer occurs in C1 pathway with production of carbon dioxide [Eq. (3)]. However, the breakage of C–C bonds is hard so the most electrocatalysts derive incomplete ethanol oxidation reaction to C2 pathway. [3-6]

$$\mathsf{C_2H_5OH} \to \mathsf{CH_3CHO} + 2\mathsf{H}^+ + 2\mathsf{e}^- \tag{1}$$

$$C_2H_5OH + H_2O \rightarrow CH_3COOH + 4H^+ + 4e^-$$
 (2)

$$C_2H_5OH + 3H_2O \rightarrow 2CO_2 + 12H^+ + 12e^-$$

As platinum (Pt) has been exhibited the best electrocatalytic performance towards oxidation of small organic molecules, the electrocatalytic oxidation of ethanol has been generally investigated on Pt-based catalysts in acidic medium.[1,7] A major limiting factor of Pt-based catalysts is the difficulty in the C-C bond breakage. So these most efficient catalysts up to now, tend to oxidize ethanol through incomplete C2 pathway and produce acetate.[8] However the reactional media rich in OH species present the improvement in the ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) and permit the employment of less noble and cheaper metals for catalyzing of EOR. [1,3,9] Although remarkable efforts are therefore being carried out to design new non-noble catalytic structures for EOR, the activity and stability of nonnoble metal electrocatalysts are not still satisfactory compared with those of rare metals. Previous studies indicated that palladium (Pd)-based catalysts are promising structures for EOR in alkaline media.[10] The EOR considerations in the alkaline media have exhibited that Pd/C in comparison to Pt/C catalysts present slightly better performance on C-C bond cleavage of ethanol in strong alkaline media. In addition, a higher abundance of Pd in earth's crust, compared to Pt, provides further motivation to exploit Pd-based catalysts. As such, Pd and Pd-based catalysts have received increased attention for EOR in alkaline media. [8] Although the recent researches focus on Pd-based catalysts, it is necessary to reduce the amount of Pd since its expense even compared with Pt. [3,11] The addition of the transition metals as the assisted element is one of the most competent approach to promote electrocatalytic performance

The porous nanostructures have been considered as the highly desired electrocatalysts that present the superb activity for EOR due to high surface area, superior charge and mass diffusion properties. A significant proportion of noble metal atoms with porous structure are located on the surface that are exposed to the electrocatalytic reactions. These nanostructures not only decrease the noble metal loading, but also increase the utilization efficiency of noble metals.<sup>[32-34]</sup> In this regard, several groups have reported the superb performance of mesoporous structure for EOR. For instance, Iqbal et al. synthesized the uniform mesoporous Pd films by using a nonionic surfactant, triblock copolymer poly (ethylene oxide)-bpoly(propylene oxide)-b-poly(ethylene oxide), as a pore-directing agent.[35] They also described a distinct method to create 3D spherical PdCu alloy nanoparticles having large-sized mesopores using PSb-PEO block copolymers micelles as pore directing agents and sacrificial templates.[36] In the other work, their group successfully synthesized mesoporous palladium nanocrystals (MPNs) that possessed various degrees of curvature through an approach that relies on a facile polymeric micelle assembly approach.[37] Li et al. synthesized mesoporous Pd nanoparticles with tunable porous constructions by using polymeric micelle-assembled structures as templates. [38] Lv et al. reported a general "dual"-template synthesis methodology for the formation of multimetallic hollow mesoporous nanospheres (PdAgCu HMSs) with an adjustable interior hollow cavity and cylindrically opened mesoporous shell as a highly efficient electrocatalyst for EOR.[39] They also reported one-pot softtemplating method relies on the "dual-template" to fabricate nanosized bimetallic PdAg hollow mesoporous nanospheres (HMSs) for electrocatalytic ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR).[40] In other work, Lv group reported a facile soft-templating strategy to precisely engineer porous architectures of multicomponent PdCuBP mesoporous nanospheres (MSs) by using the surfactants with different amphiphilic features.[41] They also described the first synthesis of Pd-B alloy mesoporous nanospheres (MNSs) by using dimethylamine borane and boric acid as both the reducing agents and boron sources and amphiphilic dioctadecyldimethylammonium chloride (DODAC) as the surfactant template. The Pd-B MNSs generated exceptional electrocatalytic performance for the EOR under alkaline conditions. [42] Chen et al. synthesized three dimensional (3D)-hollow Au microspheres (HNPs-Au) as a support for the Pd monolayer (HNPs-Au@Pd) by using a simple template method and galvanic replacement reaction.<sup>[43]</sup> Wang et al. successfully fabricated the mesoporous nanoparticles assembled PdNi/Ni nanotubes (mPdNi/Ni NTs) using nickel nanowires as sacrificial template. The synthesized mPdNi/Ni NTs exhibited superior ethanol oxidation performance to mesoporous Pd nanotubes and commercial Pd black.<sup>[44]</sup>

Different synthetic techniques including emulsion route and soft and hard template approach have been investigated to prepare porous nanostructures. Furthermore the most successful approach for the synthesis of the porous structure are the hard template method by using silica nanostructure such as silica nanoparticles and thin layer mesoporous silica as the sacrificial template.[39] The continuing popularity of silica nanostructures in the hard templates method relies on the unique features including low cost, high uniformity, widely tunable size, and so on. [45] The electro-assisted self-assembly (EASA) method combining electrochemical method and so-gel process can facilely produce the mesoporous silica thin film onto conductive solid surface. Briefly, it involves applying a suitable cathodic potential to an objective substrate immersed in a hydrolyzed sol solution. This cathodic potential results in production of hydroxide ions at solid/liquid interfaces that induced the self-assembly of surfactant-templated silica thin films on the electrode surface. the removal of the surfactant template generates the mesopores silica thin film with channels oriented perpendicular to the solid surface. [46,47]

The supporting materials are recognized as a pronounced factor affecting electrocatalytic activity through significant impact on morphology, stability, and electronic properties. As a result, the using of the support that can immobilize the metallic nanoparticles without polymer binders or carbonaceous materials is the competent approach encounter any blockage of the active sites and weakening of the catalysts. In this regard, threedimensional metal foams are introduced as the excellent catalyst support. [48,49] So, in the present study, the nickel foam (NF) substrate is used and designed with nanostructure of PdSn by using the mesoporous silica thin film as the sacrificial template. The identification of the composition and morphology of the designed NF are performed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), and energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS). The different electrochemical techniques including cyclic voltammetry (CV), chronoamperometry (CA), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) investigated the electrocatalytic activity of designed structures towards EOR in alkaline solutions. In order to explore dominance route of EOR and the role of acetaldehyde in the poisoning phenomena, acetaldehyde oxidation reaction (AOR) was also studied through electrochemical methods on the surface of the designed catalysts.

## **Results and Discussion**

#### Surface characterization

Diffractograms of TPL.Pd $_1$ Sn $_{20}$ /NF are shown in Figure 1. Two cubic crystal systems including Ni and Ni $_2$ SiO $_4$  are observed for

NF substrate. The cubic crystal system of Ni substrate is proved by high intense peaks at 44.83°, 52.25°, and 77.02° angles correspond to (111), (002), and (022) planes according to the reference code of 96-901-1604. Additionally, the diffraction peaks at 19.12°, 45.12°, and 65.73° verify (111), (004), and (044) planes of the cubic crystal systems of Ni<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub> on the report of 96-900-0731 reference code. [50] The confirmation of (001), (002), (110), and (111) planes of tetragonal crystal system of PdO is provided by appearance of diffraction peaks located at 17.04°, 34.47°, 42.58°, and 46.18° according reference code of 96-101-1330. [51] The reference code of 96-720-6471 predicts (013) and (031) planes of tetragonal crystal system of SnO with the diffraction peaks at 20 values of 61.71° and 76.73°. [52] The reference patterns of predictive phases are exhibited in Figure 1.

The morphological investigations of the NF covered with mesoporous silica thin film exhibit some overlying aggregates as low as 20 s electrodeposition times at low and high magnified FESEM images (Figures 2b, e). [53,54] The low magnified FESEM image of the TPL.Pd<sub>1</sub>Sn<sub>20</sub>/NF (Figure 2c) indicates that it is comprised of many nanoflakes that aggregation of these nanoflakes can be observed in Figure 2f. [53]

The EDS analysis was carried out to discover the elemental dispersion and composition of TPL.Pd<sub>1</sub>Sn<sub>20</sub>/NF as the EDS mapping and EDS spectrum are displayed in Figures 3a–f and Figure. 3 g respectively. The individual elemental mapping (Figures 3d, e) and EDS spectrum (Figure 3g) demonstrate TPL.Pd<sub>1</sub>Sn<sub>20</sub>/NF embraces higher amount of Pd than Sn while it was electrodeposited from a bath solution with Pd:Sn male ratio of 1:20. However their redox standard potential with patently difference resolves this contradiction.<sup>[54]</sup> The relatively high distribution of O atoms in Figure 3c is in agreement with

# **Electrochemical studies**

The base voltammograms of the NFs modified by different nanoparticles in 0.1 M NaOH solution are exhibited in Figures 4a, c. The cyclic voltammograms of Pd-based catalysts containing Sn does not show redox characteristic peaks of Sn in the scan potential range due to the inactivity of Sn within the electrochemical window where Pd is electrocatalytically active the more negative oxidation potential of Sn. [55–57] It should be remarked that Sn atoms are responsible for the nucleation of OH<sub>ads</sub> species. The marked influence of Sn on the electrochemical performance of the electrocatalysts can be also observed in the oxygen region as has been expressed in previous reports. [58] The base voltammograms at Figure 4a, c exhibit the important electrochemical features including underpotentially ad(b)sorption/ desorption of hydrogen (-0.96 to -0.52 V), double-layer charging/ discharging region (-0.5 to

-0.45 V), and formation/ reduction of PdO (-0.45 to 0.3 V) respectively. [55,59,60] A prepeak (a') appeared at -0.38 V in the anodic scan before the main Pd surface oxidation process commenced, which corresponds to oxidation at favorable sites

on the palladium surface as described elsewhere. Although a small prepeak (a') is appeared on CV curve of TPL.Pd/NF, the appearance of an intense prepeak (a') in the TPL.Pd<sub>1</sub>Sn<sub>20</sub>/NF in Figure 4c explains the synergy of the electronic interaction between two metals which resulted into a higher oxidation of the favorable sites of TPL.Pd<sub>1</sub>Sn<sub>20</sub> bimetallic nanoparticles compared to that of Pd alone.[57] As Figure 4c exhibits the thickest double-layer regions is related to the TPL.Pd<sub>1</sub>Sn<sub>20</sub>/NF. Commonly, Pt or Pd-based catalysts combining with semiconductor oxophilic metals such as Sn exhibit the broad profile of double-layer charging/discharging as the result of the increased capacitance of the catalysts.<sup>[59]</sup> In the field of electrochemical capacitors, the behavior of electrode materials MO<sub>x</sub> (M is transition metal) that have the electrochemical signature of a capacitive electrode, i.e., a linear dependence of the charge stored with changing potential within the window of interest named "pseudocapacitance" but in which charge storage originates from electron-transfer mechanisms (faradaic in origin) which involve the electrochemical interconversion between  $M^{n+}$  and  $M^{m+}$  in the solid, and corresponding insertion of cations from the electrolyte, rather than simply relying on the accumulation of ions in the electrochemical double layer. [61,62] In contrast, the thinnest profile of the double-layer charging/ discharging region is obtained for commercial Pt/C.[59] In the case of carbon supported electrodes, their electrochemical signature is mainly attributed to double-layer capacitance arising from the potential-dependence of the surface density of charges stored electrostatically (i.e., non-faradaically) at the interfaces of the capacitor electrodes. [61,62] additionally the high porosity of modified NF due to NF substrate and templating method can be resulting in the maximization of the total capacitance. [63-65] The electrochemical active surface areas (ECSA) is an important parameters that can be calculated from the Pd-O reduction charge in the base CV curve and according to Equation (4).[2,14,59] The parameters of this equation are introduced as the following.  $Q_{red}^0$ , the coulombic charge in the unit of  $\mu C$  and is determined by integrating of PdO reduction peak.  $Q_{red MI}^0$ , the conversion factor identified as the requisite charge for the reduction of Pd-O monolayer and is equal to 405  $\mu$ C cm<sup>-2</sup> in the alkaline media.  $L_{Pd}$ , the amount of Pd loading in the unit of mg. So the ECSA in a unit of  $m^2g^{-1}_{Pd}$  can be quantified by Equation (4) with a simple alteration unit (10 in the denominator).

The values of ECSAs for modified NFs with TPL.Pd<sub>1</sub>Sn<sub>20</sub>, Pd<sub>1</sub>Sn<sub>20</sub>, and TPL.Pd are respectively calculated to be about 53.70, 23.18, and 60.47 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup><sub>Pd</sub> that are much higher than that of commercial Pt/C (8.99 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup><sub>Pt</sub>).<sup>[2]</sup>

The EOR activity of TPL.Pd $_1$ Sn $_x$ /NF catalysts were investigated by recording of CV curves in a solution of 0.1 m NaOH containing 0.5 m EtOH. The lower EOR activity for TPL.Pd $_1$ Sn $_{10}$ /NF and TPL.Pd $_1$ Sn $_{40}$ /NF in comparison with TPL.Pd $_1$ Sn $_{20}$ /NF displayed in Figure 4b can be respectively justified as insufficient Sn and Pd active sites.

oxidative removal of the adsorbed intermediates while the latter deeply affect the amount or strength bonding between Pd atoms and alcohols. [66-69] The great participation of Sn in the decline of the EOR overpotential is confirmed by 0.06 V negative shifts at the onset potential of TPL.Pd<sub>1</sub>Sn<sub>20</sub>/NF compared to that of TPL.Pd/NF (Figure 4d). The mass activities of TPL.Pd<sub>1</sub>Sn<sub>20</sub>/NF (3246.6 mA mg<sup>-1</sup><sub>Pd</sub>) is much higher than that of TPL.Pd/NF (1267.9 mA mg<sup>-1</sup><sub>Pd</sub>). Sn or its oxides, can supply surface oxygen-containing species for the oxidative removal of CO-like species strongly adsorbed on adjacent Pd active sites while the CO does not prefer to bind with Sn surface atoms. As a consequence, the Sn surface sites are always free to adsorb OH<sup>-</sup> species and these oxygen containing surface species are necessary for the oxidation of adsorbed CO-like intermediates. This is the so-called bifunctional mechanism and explains partially the enhanced effect of the second metal on the Pd. [67,69-72]

Figure 4d exhibits that the TPL.Pd<sub>1</sub>Sn<sub>20</sub>/NF possesses the best EOR activity which can achieve 11.2 times higher compared to the state of the ate commercial Pt/C.[73] Although the superior EOR performance of TPL.Pd<sub>1</sub>Sn<sub>20</sub>/NF compared with commercial Pt/C can result from the composition and morphological effect, the effective role of NF as the excellent substrate can't be ignored. While the NF substrate cannot directly affect EOR at low potentials region, as a transition metal can offer oxygenated species in the alkaline medium at low potentials to promote the oxidative removal of the adsorbed CO intermediate. Besides the bifunctional effect, the 3D porous frameworks of NF facilitate the mass diffusion which is also beneficial for the continuous large current harvest.[74] The electrochemical parameters obtained from CV curves are compared with some Pd-based catalysts in Table 1. The long-time stability of TPL.Pd<sub>1</sub>Sn<sub>20</sub>/NF and comparative catalysts during EOR were studied by recording of chronoamperometry (CA) curves at -0.1 V. Figure 5a displays the recorded normalized current (J/J<sub>0</sub>%) during continuously working of 3600 s. The normalized current exhibiting retention of current after continuously working is the ratio between retained current at each time and the initial current. The initial rapid decline in the EOR activity occurs due to the poisoning of catalyst surface with the carbonaceous intermediate and the partial dissolution of the electrocatalysts. However, the slowest decay and proper maintenance of EOR activity are the important factors in introducing the most

durable catalysts. In this respect, TPL.Pd<sub>1</sub>Sn<sub>20</sub>/NF exhibited the best electrocatalytic durability among the counterparts.<sup>[22]</sup> Figure 5b compares the CV curves of the TPL.Pd<sub>1</sub>Sn<sub>20</sub>/NF before and after CA test. Clearly, the negative and positive potential shift in the onset and forward peak potentials are respectively seen.<sup>[2]</sup>

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is recognized as a powerful technique for investigation of the resistance against the charge and mass transfer. The plotting imaginary against real impedance yields a graph with two semicircles in high and low frequency identified as the Nyquist plot. The fast reactions having the low resistance against charge and mass transfer generate Nyquist plots with the small semicircle diameter. As Figure 6a exhibits, the semicircular diameter of the modified NFs with bimetallic catalysts (TPL.Pd<sub>1</sub>Sn<sub>20</sub> and Pd<sub>1</sub>Sn<sub>20</sub>) are smaller than that of TPL.Pd, indicating a smaller chargetransfer resistance and faster reaction rate due to the rapid transport of the active species and electrons.<sup>[78]</sup> Overall, the best EIS behavior of TPL.Pd<sub>1</sub>Sn<sub>20</sub>/NF attributed to the simultaneous contribution of composition and morphology conforms to the best activity in CV and CA experiment results.[75] The comparative EIS results in Figure 6a exhibit extremely large semicircular for commercial Pt/C in comparison with modified NFs due to very poor electrical conductivity. This comparison can credit the role of NF substrate in the accelerated electron transfer. Such 3D macroporous metallic skeleton can serve as a desirable substrate that enhanced EOR performance as the result of the excellent conductivity.[79] Figure 6b exhibits the Nyquist plot of

This Figure exhibits that the semicircle diameter of TPL.Pd<sub>1</sub>Sn<sub>20</sub>/NF decreases as well as potential increases up to  $E_{1/2}$  due to the oxidative removal of carbonaceous intermediates at higher potential.<sup>[75]</sup> Although the Nyquist plot at the  $E_{1/2}$  presents the smallest semicircle, the formation of the inactive PdO species at higher potentials worsens the surface conductivity. [75,80]

The respective Bode plots (Figure 6c, d) show a maximum at low frequency ranges as the frequency of this deviation  $(f_0)$ depends on the potential as well as the frequency. [78,79] Figure 6c exhibits the highest f<sub>o</sub> value for TPL.Pd<sub>1</sub>Sn<sub>20</sub>/NF implying the highest EOR activity for the this catalyst. [81] As Figure 6d exhibits, the exponentially increase in  $f_0$  value and the decrease in maximum phase angle occur with increasing electrode potential up to E<sub>1/2</sub> due to enhancement of electrocatalysis at higher potentials within the tested potential range.[82]

To study the final products of EOR and composition effect on these products, the electrocatalytic activity of TPL.Pd<sub>1</sub>Sn<sub>20</sub>/ NF and TPL.Pd/NF towards EtOH, AAL, and AA oxidation in 0.1 M NaOH solution were considered. Figure 7a,b display no oxidation current for AA oxidation suggesting acetate is a dead end product during EOR. As Figure 7 exhibits, the current in the hydrogen adsorption/desorption region in the presence of sodium acetate is higher than that in blank solution.

This phenomenon can be explained by hydrogen-bonding interaction between carbonyl of undissociated acetate and inner layer water molecules.[83] The highest mass activity is obtained during acetaldehyde oxidation reaction (AOR) indicating AAL is an active intermediate for the EOR in counterpart with previous studies.<sup>[84]</sup> The onset potential of AOR on TPL.Pd<sub>1</sub>Sn<sub>20</sub>/NF is lower than that of EOR in contrast with

Figure 7. CV curves during oxidation of 0.1 M EtOH, AAL, and AA in 0.1 M NaOH at a scan rate of 0.05 Vs<sup>-1</sup> for TPL.Pd<sub>1</sub>Sn<sub>20</sub>/NF (a) and TPL.Pd/NF (b).

TPL.Pd/NF. This can be explained by different between polarity and adsorption process of AAL and EtOH. [85]

The fast deactivation of the surface during EOR in alkaline media is generally attributed to aldol condensation of acetaldehyde because CO would have been entirely oxidized at the upper potential limit. This phenomenon seriously impairs efficiency due to EOR cessation by exchange of 2 electrons. [8,86,87] To define the role of AAL in poisoning phenomenon during EOR on the surface of TPL.Pd<sub>1</sub>Sn<sub>20</sub>/NF, several consecutive CV curves in 0.1 M NaOH containing 0.2 M ethanol and 0.2 M acetaldehyde were carried out. After a rinsing step, the CV curves of the poisoned catalysts were recorded in blank electrolyte and compared with that of a newly catalyst surface. Figure 8b exhibits a small peak (star peak) in enough negative potentials for the poisoned catalyst during EOR (Figure 8a). The comparison between shape of the voltammograms of the poisoned catalyst before and after consecutive CV curves in blank electrolyte (Figure S1) suggests that the surface of the electrodes is fully recovered. Thus this star peak can be related to CO species as the EOR products that are even oxidized in double layer region.[58,88-90] However the implementation of same experiments for AOR demonstrate more intense surface poisoning during AOR than that of EOR (Figure S2a). Figure S2b less intensely displays the star peak while proves more production of poisoning species probably acetate with enormous capability for occupation of the surface oxide (inset of Figure 7a). The comparison between Figure S2b and Figure S3

Figure 8. The consecutive CV curves of TPL.Pd<sub>1</sub>Sn<sub>20</sub>/NF during EOR (a) and refreshing in blank electrolyte (b) at a scan rate of 0.05 V s<sup>-1</sup>.

proves that AOR effects no aldol condensation products. So EOR on the surface of TPL.Pd<sub>1</sub>Sn<sub>20</sub>/NF proceeds to C1 pathway as the dominant rout with 12 electron transfer. According to the AOR studies, even though EOR is carried out through C2 pathway with AAL production as the active intermediate isn't broken off with 2 electron transfer. The effect of composition on the EOR mechanism and the poisoning species were studied by same experiments on the surface of TPL.Pd/NF (Figure S4ad). Although the results demonstrate any CO species as the final product of EOR or AOR, they manifest the moderate decline after initial growth in EOR activity contrary to AOR. So the dominant EOR rout on the surface of TPL.Pd/NF is presented C2 pathway with acetate as the final product.[86] This is the enormous capacity of Sn to promote EOR performance of Pd catalyst. For the purpose of illustration, the dominant EOR mechanism on the surface of TPL.Pd<sub>1</sub>Sn<sub>20</sub>/NF and TPL.Pd/NF are shown in Scheme 1.

# Conclusion

To summarize, we have precisely modified NF substrate with TPL.Pd<sub>1</sub>Sn<sub>x</sub> nanoparticles with controlled-shapes and provided a platform for the research of the relationship between EOR activity and composition and morphology. The evaluation of EOR activity in the alkaline media exhibited that the TPL.Pd<sub>1</sub>Sn<sub>20</sub>/NF shows nearly 11.2 times enhancement in catalytic activity compared with state of the art commercial Pt/C. The consideration of AOR on the surface of TPL.Pd<sub>1</sub>Sn<sub>20</sub>/NF and TPL.Pd/NF proved that presence of tin in the structure of TPL.Pd<sub>1</sub>Sn<sub>20</sub>/NF can appreciably promote the electrooxidation of ethanol through C1 pathway and prevent the aldol condensation and so efficiency decline during C2 pathway.

# **Experimental Section**

#### Chemicals and instrumentation

All of the materials including PdCl<sub>2</sub>, SnCl<sub>2</sub>, NaNO<sub>3</sub>, tetraethoxysilane (TEOS), cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), NaOH, HCl, ethanol (EtOH), acetaldehyde (AAL), sodium acetate (NaOAc), and acetone were purchased from Merck, Sigma-Aldrich, and Fluka companies with analytical grade and used without further purification. The double distilled water was gotten for preparation and dilution of solutions or wherever. Nickel foam (NF, 90–98% porosity) and fuel cell grade commercial Pt/C (Platinum on Vulcan xc 72) were respectively purchased from Liyuan Co (Changsha, China) and Sainergy Tech company (USA).

The X-ray diffraction spectroscopy (XRD, PW 1730, PHILIPS, Netherlands), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, TESCAN MIRA3, Czech Republic), and energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS, TESCAN MIRA3, Czech Republic) were employed to study crystallography, morphology, and elemental composition of the designed catalyst. The inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES, Varian Vista-PRO, Germany) was used for determination of metal loading on the surface of NF. An electrochemical workstation (ZIVE LAB with Smart Manager 6.6.4.0 software guidance) with three-electrode setup (The reference, counter, and working electrodes were respectively saturated Ag/AgCl, Pt wire, and the modified NF) was used to perform the electrochemical tests.

#### Preparation of catalyst

#### The formation of the mesoporous silica thin film

Firstly, the sol precursor containing 13.6 mmol TEOS, 20 ml ethanol, 20 ml aqueous solution of 0.1 m NaNO<sub>3</sub> and 10<sup>-3</sup> m HCl, and 4.35 mmol CTAB was aged for 2.5 hours under moderate stirring. Secondly, a piece of clean NF was immersed in the aged sol precursor and the formation of the silica thin film was performed by applying 20 s EASA method at a constant potential of -1.2 V.<sup>[47,91]</sup> The overnight drying along with aging of the electrodeposited surfactant-templated silica thin film in an oven of 130 °C changed the color of the modified NF to white. Thirdly, the using of an 0.1 m HCl ethanolic solution and 5 min modest stirring of the covered NF in this solution resulted in the extraction of the surfactant template and achievement in the mesoporous silica thin film. [47,91]

# Electrochemical synthesis of metallic nanoparticles

The electrodeposition of  $Pd_1Sn_x$  (x=10, 20, and 40 respectively) bimetallic catalysts were performed by immersion of NF covered with mesoporous silica thin film and applying 20 s cathodic potential of -0.8 V in an acidic solution of  $PdCl_2$  containing  $SnCl_2$  with  $Pd^{2+}:Sn^{2+}$  mole ratio of 1:10, 1:20, and 1:40 for x=10, 20, and 40 respectively. The effective role of Sn atoms in the electrocatalytic activity was examined by electrodeposition of monometallic Pd catalyst from a solution of 0.5 mm  $PdCl_2$  on the covered NF with mesoporous silica thin film. To investigate the profitability of templating method, the electrodepotion of bimetallic catalyst from an acidic solution of  $PdCl_2$  and  $SnCl_2$  with the mole ratio of 1:20 was carried out by applying the same condition on the bare NF. This catalyst was denoted as  $Pd_1Sn_{20}/NF$ .

### Template removal

Eventually, the achievement in NF covered with mesoporous mono or bi metallic catalysts were carried out by removal of mesoporous silica thin films as the sacrificial template. This process was implemented by recording of 2 consecutive cyclic voltammograms between -1 to 0.5 V in a saturated NaOH solution at a scan rate of  $0.02 \, \text{V} \, \text{s}^{-1} \, ^{[49,91-93]}$  After this step, the designed NFs with bimetallic and mono metallic catalysts were labeled as TPL.Pd<sub>1</sub>Sn<sub>x</sub>/NF and TPL.Pd/NF.

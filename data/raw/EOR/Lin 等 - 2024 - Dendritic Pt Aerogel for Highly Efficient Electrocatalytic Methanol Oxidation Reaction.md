# Dendritic Pt Aerogel for Highly Efficient Electrocatalytic Methanol Oxidation Reaction

Shuai Lin, [a] Lingwei Wang, [b] Xia Liu, [a] Chen Cai, [a] and Bin Cai\*[b]

Metallic aerogels, as featured by high surface area, porosity, and self-supported metal skeleton, are regarded as an ideal platform for developing next-generation electrocatalysts. However, the precise adjustment of their skeleton nanostructure to enhance catalytic properties remains significantly underexplored. Herein, inspired by the impact of the metal atoms' coordination number on their reactivity, we devised and prepared dendritic

Pt aerogels (DPAs) via a facile sol-gel method. The synergy of aerogel structure and coordinatively distinct catalytic sites from dendritic morphology enables DPAs to exhibit markedly improved electrocatalytic activity and stability for methanol oxidation reaction. The mass activity and specific activity of DPAs are  $1.28 \, \mathrm{Amg_{pt}}^{-1}$  and  $1.5 \, \mathrm{mA\,cm_{pt}}^{-2}$ , which are  $4.1 \, \mathrm{and} \, 3.2$  times higher than those of commercial Pt/C, respectively.

## Introduction

Metallic aerogels combine the distinct properties of metals and aerogels, rendering them highly desirable functional materials across various applications.[1] Particularly in electrocatalysis, their metallic framework, large specific surface area, high porosity, and self-supporting nature enhance electron transfer, create abundant active sites, facilitate mass transport, and improve structural stability and durability. [2] These features make metallic aerogels as an ideal candidate for the development of next-generation electrocatalysts aimed at the next wave of energy storage and conversion solutions, including fuel cells and water electrolyzers.[3] To date, utilizing the structural modulation strategies from the field of nanoscience, a variety of metal aerogels featuring complex nanostructures, such as coreshells<sup>[4]</sup>, hollow structures, <sup>[5]</sup> and alloys, <sup>[6]</sup> have been synthesized, each demonstrating remarkable electrocatalytic efficiency. However, such advancements remain limited to a few examples, highlighting the ongoing desirability for synthesizing metallic aerogels with sophisticated nanostructures to boost their catalytic performance.

The coordination environment of surface sites in metal catalysts significantly influences their binding behavior to adsorbates and reaction intermediates. Consequently, each coordinatively distinct catalytic site can exhibit unique reactivity due to its specific local structural environment. An important corollary of this concept is that defective surfaces, characterized by varying coordination numbers, can disrupt the scaling relationships be-tween reaction intermediates, thereby accelerating the rate of multiple electrocatalytic reactions.

behavior has been experimentally verified across various reactions, including oxygen reduction reaction, hydrogen evolution reaction, and methanol oxidation reactions (MOR), among others.

In this work, we synthesized dendritic Pt aerogels (DPAs) using a facile sol-gel method. The abundance of edge, corner, and defect atoms resulting from the dendritic structure offers diverse catalytic sites with distinct coordination numbers, exhibiting potential for various electrocatalytic reactions. As illustrated by MOR, the DPAs demonstrate exceptional activity, with a mass activity of 1.28 Amg<sub>Pt</sub><sup>-1</sup> and a specific activity of 1.5 mAcm<sub>Pt</sub><sup>-2</sup>, significantly outperforming commercial Pt/C (0.31 Amg<sub>Pt</sub><sup>-1</sup> and 0.46 mAcm<sub>Pt</sub><sup>-2</sup>, respectively). Moreover, the self-supported structure of DPAs effectively prevents the agglomeration process commonly observed in nanocatalysts, thereby ensuring high structural and activity durability.

## **Experimental Section**

## Materials

Ascorbic acid (AA, 99.5%),  $K_2PtCl_4$  (98%),  $H_2SO_4$  (95–97%, puriss. p.a.), Pluronic F-127 (99.9%), and Nafion solution (5 wt.%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Ace-tone (ACS, ISO, Reag. Ph Eur), ethanol (ACS, ISO, Reag. Ph Eur), and formic acid (98%) were purchased from Merck. NaCl (99.8%) and methanol (99.9%) was supplied by Iso-commerz and Alfa Aesar, respectively. All chemicals were used as received without further purification.

### Synthesis of Dendritic Pt Nanoparticles (DPNs)

A block copolymer-mediated synthetic strategy was employed for the synthesis of DPNs.<sup>[13]</sup> Specifically, 6 mL of 20 mM K2PtCl4 aqueous solution containing 60 mg (0.794 mM) Pluronic F127 was placed in a small beaker, followed by the rapid addition of 6 mL of 100 mM AA. The resulting mixture solution was then subjected to a 40 °C ultrasonic bath operating at a frequency of 56 kHz for 5 min. As the growth proceeded, the color of the reaction solution was gradually changed from transparent light brownish yellow to brown and then to opaque black (Figure S1). Subsequently, ultra-

filtration centrifugation was employed for purification, yielding a final volume of 3 mL of concentrated DPNs solution.

#### Synthesis of Dendritic Pt Aerogels (DPAs)

The salting-out effect was employed to destabilize the concentrated DPNs solution and facilitate the assembly of DPNs into gels. <sup>[14]</sup> To initiate this process, a NaCl solution (final concentration 30 mM) was added to the concentrated DPNs solution, which was then stirred for 30 minutes and left at room temperature for 2 days. Subsequently, the DPN hydrogels were formed. After undergoing a CO<sub>2</sub> supercritical drying process, as described previously, <sup>[15]</sup> the resulting hydrogels were transformed into the final DPAs.

#### Characterizations

Power X-ray diffraction (PXRD) was carried out with a Rigaku SmartLab 9 KW diffractometer equipped with a Cu-sealed tube (wavelength,  $\lambda\!=\!1.5418$  Å) at 45 kV and 200 mA. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data were collected with a Thermo Fisher ESCALAB XI+ using monochromatic AI  $K\alpha$  radiation (1,486.6 eV) and the binding energy of the C 1 s peak at 284.6 eV was used as a reference. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) experiments were conducted on a Tecnai G2 20 (FEI) micro-scope at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. High-resolution (HR)-TEM experiments were performed on a Titan 80–300 (FEI) microscope operated at an accelerating volt-age of 300 kV.

#### **Electrochemical Measurements**

All electrochemical measurements were conducted using a threeelectrode con-figuration at room temperature with a CHI 760E workstation (Shanghai Chenhua Instrument Corporation, China). A modified glassy carbon electrode (GCE, 3 mm in diameter) served as the working electrode, a saturated mercurous sulfate electrode was used as the reference electrode, and Pt foil acted as the counter electrode. Inks containing different catalysts were prepared by dispersing catalysts (0.5 mg and 2.0 mg for DPAs and Pt/C, respectively) in a mixture of 495 µL water, 495 µL isopropanol, and 10  $\mu$ L Nafion solution and sonicating for 30 min. Subsequently, 2  $\mu$ L of the prepared inks were deposited onto the GCE and dried under ambient conditions. Cyclic voltammogram (CV) tests were first performed in N2-saturated 0.5 M H2SO4 at a sweep rate of 100 mV s<sup>-1</sup> until a steady state was achieved, followed by recording a stable CV curve at a sweep rate of 50 mV s<sup>-1</sup>. MOR performance was evaluated by conducting CV tests at a scan rate of 50 mV s<sup>-1</sup> in N<sub>2</sub>-saturated 0.5 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> solution containing 1 M methanol. To investigated the durability of catalysts, chronoamperometry tests were per-formed at a constant potential of 0.8  $V_{RHE}$  in  $N_2$ -saturated 0.5 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> solution containing 1 M methanol.

## **Results and Discussion**

The synthesis of DPAs was carried out by a facile bottom-up method. Briefly, DPNs, which serve as building blocks, were synthesized by a block copolymer mediated synthetic strategy. The colloidal solutions of DPNs were concentrated to reach a "meta-stable state" and then were destabilized by adding NaCl solutions, resulting in the assembly of DPNs into gel. After washing and CO<sub>2</sub> supercritical drying, self-supported monolithic DPAs can be obtained.

The SEM and TEM images reveal an extensive 3D porous network structure in the resulting DPAs (Figure 1a and b). A magnified view of the skeleton demonstrates the highly branched structure of the DPAs, consistent with that of the DPNs, indicating the preservation of DPNs integrity during the gelation and drying processes (Figures 1c and S2). We next employed XPS to analyze the surface electronic structures and chemical states of DPAs, focusing on the Pt 4f signal. As shown in Figure S3, deconvolution revealed two sets of doublets at 71.3 eV and 74.6 eV, and 72.4 eV and 75.7 eV, respectively, corresponding to the  $Pt^0$  and  $Pt^{2+}$  valence states. [10b,16] The notably higher intensity of the Pt<sup>0</sup> peaks relative to the Pt<sup>2+</sup> peaks suggests that Pt in DPAs primarily exists in the metallic state with a minor degree of oxidation. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of DPAs exhibits characteristic diffraction peaks of face-centered cubic (fcc) Pt structure (Figure S4), with peaks at 39.8°, 46.2°, 67.4°, 81.3°, and 85.7° corresponding to the (111), (200), (220), (311), and (222) planes, respectively. HR-TEM was further employed to investigate the crystalline properties of DPAs. Figure 1d shows regular lattice fringes of fcc Pt throughout several branches and grain boundaries highlighted by white dashed lines, suggesting the poly-crystalline nature of DPAs, as supported by the fast Fourier transform (FFT) pattern. Additionally, it is important to note that numerous lattice dislocations and stacking faults are visible near grain boundaries. These defective atoms, along with edge, corner, and step sites, can demonstrate distinctive reactivity because of their differing coordination numbers.

As a proof-of-concept, MOR was selected to investigate the catalytic properties of the DPAs. The CV curves of DPAs, DPNs/C and Pt/C were initially recorded in 0.5 M  $H_2SO_4$ . As shown in Figure S5, all catalysts display CV curves characteristic of polycrystalline platinum, featuring a region of underpotential deposited hydrogen ( $H_{upd}$ ) adsorption/desorption between 0.05  $V_{RHE}$  and 0.4  $V_{RHE}$  as well as a region associated with the formation/reduction of oxygenated species above 0.55  $V_{RHE}$ . The electrochemically active area (ECSA) can be estimated by integrating the oxidation charge of  $H_{upd}$  and assuming a specific charge of 210  $\mu$ C cm $_{Pt}$   $^{-2}$ . The DPAs show an ECSA of 84.7  $m^2$   $g_{Pt}$  higher than that of DPNs/C (71.3  $m^2$   $g_{Pt}$  and Pt/C (67.4  $m^2$   $g_{Pt}$ ), indicating that the gel structure with a highly dendritic skeleton can generate more active sites.

Figure 2a shows Pt-mass-normalized CV curves acquired in  $0.5 \text{ M H}_2\text{SO}_4$  and 1 M methanol solution. The peak current for MOR of DPAs ( $1.28 \text{ Amg}_{\text{Pt}}^{-1}$ ) is  $2.1 \text{ and } 4.1 \text{ times higher than that of DPNs/C } (0.61 \text{ Amg}_{\text{Pt}}^{-1})$  and Pt/C ( $0.31 \text{ Amg}_{\text{Pt}}^{-1}$ ), respectively, while the onset potential is lower on DPAs than on Pt/C by ~0.1 V. Additionally, normalizing the methanol oxidation current to ECSA, we found that the specific activity of DPAs ( $1.5 \text{ mAcm}_{\text{Pt}}^{-2}$ ) remains  $1.5 \text{ and } 3.2 \text{ times greater than that of DPNs/C } (1.0 \text{ mA cm}_{\text{Pt}}^{-2})$  and Pt/C ( $0.46 \text{ mA cm}_{\text{Pt}}^{-2}$ ), respectively (Figure 2b). These observations reveal a significantly enhanced MOR activity in DPAs, attributable to the increased exposure of catalytic sites and intrinsically improved kinetic rates on its defective surface, characterized by varying co-ordination numbers. The superior performance of DPAs in MOR surpasses that of many previously reported Pt-based nanocatalysts and is

comparable to that of reported Pt-atom-on-Ru single-atom catalyst (Figure 2c and Table S1).

Catalyst durability is a crucial parameter to consider for practical energy conversion devices, alongside activity. Unfortunately, nanocatalysts often agglomerate due to particle migration and Oswald ripening, driven by their relatively high surface energy. This process results in the loss of their initially designed structure and ECSA. In contrast, metallic aerogels assembled from nano-building blocks can be considered as an "aggregated state", with their self-supported skeleton providing enhanced stability. As shown by chronoamperometry test, DPAs experience significantly slower current decay compared to DPNs/C and Pt/C, indicating its improved stability (Figure 3a). Given that a substantial portion of the current decay results from the poisoning effect of MOR intermediates (e.g., CO), we subsequently calculated the ECSAs following the stability tests of DPAs and Pt/C. The DPAs essentially maintain the same ECSA level after stability test, while the DPNs/C and Pt/C show substantial drops of 12.2% and 29.3%, respectively, in ECSA (Figure S6). TEM characterization confirms that the highly dendritic skeleton of DPAs remains well-preserved after stability test (Figure 3b). Furthermore, a long-term chronoamperometry test, during which the DPAs could easily recover its activity by refreshing the electrolyte, further validates the excellent structural stability and active durability of DPAs (Figure 3c).

# **Conclusion**

In conclusion, we synthesized DPAs via a NaCl-induced destabilization and assembly process of DPNs. The distinct reactivity of coordinatively distinct catalytic sites, originating from highly dendritic structure, along with high surface area (facilitating active site exposure), porosity (enhancing mass transfer), and metallic skeleton (enabling rapid electron transfer), positions DPAs as highly promising electrocatalysts. As the proof-of-concept demonstration, we have decoded that the DPAs show superior electrocatalytic activity toward MOR, surpassing that of commercial Pt/C and many previously reported Pt-based nanocatalysts. Moreover, the self-supported structure of DPAs effectively prevents the agglomeration process commonly observed in nanocatalysts, thereby ensuring high structural and activity durability.

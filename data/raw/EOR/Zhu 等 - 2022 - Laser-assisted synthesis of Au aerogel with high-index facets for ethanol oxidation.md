#### Abstract

Gold (Au) can be used as an ideal metal electrocatalyst for ethanol and glucose oxidation reactions due to its high performance-to-cost ratio. In this paper, the Au aerogel with high-index facets was synthesized by using the laser ablation in liquid technology, which can improve the electrocatalytic activity of Au. The as-prepared Au aerogel showed excellent mass activity and specific activity toward ethanol oxidation reaction, which are 4.6 times and 2.1 times higher than Au/C, respectively. The 3D porous nature and rich defect of the Au aerogel provide more active sites. In addition, the high-index facets with under-coordinated atoms enhance the adsorption of ethanol and glucose molecules, thus improving the intrinsic catalytic activity of Au aerogel. The effect of high-index facets has also been investigated by density functional theory calculations. Furthermore, the Au aerogels also show good electrocatalytic activity and stability toward glucose oxidation reaction. These results are conducive to promote the practical application of Au in electrocatalysis.

#### 1. Introduction

Direct liquid fuel cell (DLFC), as an emerging energy conversion device, can directly convert chemical energy to electrical energy. Due to its advantages of high-power generation efficiency and low environmental pollution, DLFC has been regarded as an alternative to traditional fossil energy sources and received more and more extensive research in recent years [[1](#page-7-0), [2](#page-7-0)]. Ethanol [[3](#page-7-0)–[6](#page-7-0)] is widely used reactant in fuel cell oxidation reactions. However, the slow kinetics and high over-potentials of the anodic oxidation reactions remain challenges to the commercialization of the DLFC [[7](#page-7-0), [8](#page-8-0)]. Electrocatalysts with high activities are required to accelerate the kinetics of electrode reactions. Pt-based materials are commonly used electrocatalyst materials [[9](#page-8-0)–[11](#page-8-0)]. But the high cost and scarcity of Pt metals limit its wide application. Moreover, the strong adsorption of intermediates (such as acetaldehyde, or carbon monoxide) will cause the rapid declination of catalyst activity [[12](#page-8-0)–[15](#page-8-0)]. Compared with Pd, Pt and Ru, Au has a relatively low price and higher reserves.

But bulk Au has long been considered as catalytically inert due to its weak adsorption toward reactants. Recently, researchers discover that nano-scaled Au (less than 6 nm in diameter) can improve its catalytic activity toward some oxidation and reduction reactions, which is attributed to the under-coordinated atoms on the surface [[16](#page-8-0)–[18](#page-8-0)]. In these

cases, only a small part of surface atoms serves as active sites [[19](#page-8-0)]. High-index facets as a highly open surface structure, can be represented by a set of Miller indices {hkl} with at least one index larger than unity [[20](#page-8-0)]. The structures with highindex facets contain a high density of surface steps and kinks which can expose more under-coordination atoms [[21](#page-8-0)–[24](#page-8-0)]. Thus, Au nanostructures with high-index facets have been considered for further promoting the catalytic activity of Au. However, it remains a challenge to prepare Au nanostructures with high-index facets. In common, Au nanostructures tend to grow along low-index facets according to thermodynamics or kinetics. Only few papers show the preparation of Au nanocrystals with high-index facets by conventional chemical preparation methods [[25](#page-8-0)–[27](#page-8-0)].

Besides, rational modification of the geometric structure of Au, such as forming aerogel, can also effectively improve the catalytic activity of Au [[28](#page-8-0)]. The unique 3D porous structure of Au aerogels exhibits excellent structural stability and helps to expose more active sites [[29](#page-8-0)]. Traditional sol-gel method for Au material usually utilizes chloroauric acid as a precursor and prepares gels by using dopamine [[30](#page-8-0)] or sodium borohydride [[31](#page-8-0)]. The laser ablation in liquid (LAL) technology, originated in the nineteen-nineties, can avoid the expensive chloroauric acid, thus producing high-purity metal nanoparticles [[32](#page-8-0)]. In addition, the unique local high-temperature and high-pressure plasma and rapid quenching facilitate the formation of defects (grain boundaries, stacking faults, twins, etc) [[33](#page-8-0)] and highindex facets on the Au aerogel surface.

Here, we have acquired self-supported Au aerogel with rich defect and high-index facets by using LAL technology. The as-prepared Au aerogel exhibit remarkable electrocatalytic activity toward ethanol and glucose oxidation. The improvement of catalytic activity is mainly ascribed to the defect structure (stacking faults, twins, grain boundaries) and under-coordinated atoms at the high-index facets, which expose more active sites and provide higher intrinsic catalytic activity. This work paves a way for improving the catalytic performance of Au material.

The setting of laser beam is listed as following: wavelength of 1064 nm, pulse width of 7 ns, single pulse energy of 120 mJ, repetition rate of 10 Hz. The ablation time is 6 min. The gelation of Au colloid was initiated by adding 150 μl 0.05 M dopamine solution to the colloid. One hour later, the black precipitate was collected and washed four times with copious amounts of deionized water. Then, it was washed twice with acetone and four times with deionized water. Finally, the Au aerogel was obtained by freeze drying.

Under continuous stirring, 0.25 ml HAuCl4 (15 mM) was added to 19 ml NaCA (0.3 wt%) solution, freshly prepared 0.76 ml NaBH4 (32 mM) was added quickly. The solution was stirred for 5 min and left at room temperature for about 6 h. The black precipitate was collected, washed, and freezedried. The transmission electron microscope (TEM) and high resolution TEM (HRTEM) images of prepared S-Au aerogel are shown in figure S1 (available online at [stacks.iop.org](http://stacks.iop.org/NANO/33/225404/mmedia)/ NANO/33/225404/[mmedia](http://stacks.iop.org/NANO/33/225404/mmedia)).

## 2.4. Preparation of Au/C catalyst

Carbon black of 6.2 mg was mixed with 38.5 ml water, followed 1 h ultrasonic treatment to obtain a uniform carbon black dispersion. Then 0.7 ml chloroauric acid solution (5 mM) was added and stirred for 10 min, then 0.8 ml freshly prepared NaBH4 (0.1 M) was added quickly and followed with continuous stirring for 2 h, and then let it stand. When the solution becomes clear, the sample was collected and washed with deionized water, and dried overnight in a vacuum oven at 60 °C. The SEM, TEM and HRTEM images of prepared Au/C are shown in figure S2.

and then 1  $\mu$ l Nafion (0.5 wt%) was dropped. Underpotential deposition of lead (Pb-upd) was carried out in 0.1 M NaOH + 1 mM Pb (NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> electrolyte at a scan rate of 5 mV s<sup>-1</sup>. Ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) or glucose oxidation reaction (GOR) was tested in 1 M KOH and 1 M KOH + reactant (1 M ethanol solution or 0.01M glucose solution) at a scan rate of 50 mV s<sup>-1</sup>.

# 2.7. Calculation method and model density functional theory (DFT)

DFT calculations were performed with the Vienna *ab initio* simulation package (VASP), using the projector augmented wave (PAW) pseudopotential with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) of exchange correlation function based on generalized gradient approximation (GGA). The Gibbs free energy (G) is calculated by the following:  $G = H - TS = E_{DFT} + E_{ZPE} + E_{H} - TS$ , where  $E_{DFT}$ ,  $E_{ZPE}$ ,  $E_{H}$  and TS represent the total energy given by DFT, the zero-point energy correction, the enthalpy contribution, and the entropy contribution, respectively. The ideal gas approximation and the harmonic approximation were used for the molecules and the adsorbates. All thermodynamic energies were calculated at a temperature of 298.15 K and a pressure of 1 atm.

## 3. Results and discussion

As shown in figure 1(a), the Au aerogel was prepared via a two-step method. Firstly, the Au colloid was acquired by laser ablation Au target in NaCA solution (figure 1(b)). The acquired Au NPs were coated with NaCA, which simultaneously generates electrostatic and spatial repulsion [34]. The

two repulsive interactions are balanced with van der Waals forces to stabilize the Au NPs with size of  $4.3\pm0.8$  nm [35]. After adding dopamine, the balance was disrupted due to the strong affinity between dopamine and Au NPs [36]. The NaCA molecules around the Au NPs are stripped out by dopamine. The Au NPs began to collide and connect. The gelation process was initiated. Three minutes later, Au NPs began to attach and connect with each other (figure 1(c)). The diameters of the short wires are in the range of  $4.6\pm0.9$  nm. Finally, a 3D network structure was formed with an average ligament size of  $4.9\pm0.9$  nm after 1 h (figure 1(d)). Competitive adsorption-induced gelation of NPs has been used to synthesize aerogel [30, 34, 37].

The gelation process was also monitored by UV-vis absorbance spectroscopy (figure 2(a)). The surface plasmon resonance (SPR) peak of Au NPs with size of ~5 nm is typically located at 518 nm. After the addition of dopamine, the SPR peak of the Au colloid broadens and exhibits a significant red shift (from 518 nm to 540 nm), which indicate that the Au NPs have grown into larger nanostructures [38, 39]. The absorbance gradually decreases in the nearinfrared regime with time, which corresponds to the sedimentation of the 3D porous Au aerogel structure. This is consistent with the TEM image of the L-Au formation shown in figure 1.

According to the XPS result (figure 2(b)), it can be seen that the surface composition of L-Au aerogel is dominated by metallic Au, but other elements (such as O, C, and N) are also detectable. The N 1s signal at 400.0 eV and the C 1s signal at 284.8 eV come from dopamine on the sample surface. The Au 4f spectrum of L-Au aerogel (figure 2(c)) contains two peaks of 87.4 eV and 83.7 eV, which correspond to Au  $4f_{5/2}$  and Au  $4f_{7/2}$ , respectively. As shown in the SEM image (figure 2(d)),

<span id="page-4-0"></span>**Figure 2.** Characterizations of L-Au aerogel.

the L-Au aerogel has a typical 3D porous structure. The surface area and porosity of the L-Au aerogel are demonstrated by N<sub>2</sub> physisorption isotherm (figures 2(e), (f)). The calculated specific surface area is about 59.0 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup> by fitting the data with the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) isotherm, which is much higher than other porous Au materials and Au aerogel [40]. The adsorption isotherm is the combination of a type IV and a type II curve, indicating the wide-spread presence of both micropores and mesopores within the aerogel structures. The most micropores are distributed at 6 nm (figure 2(f)). According to a rough estimate after measuring the volume and weight of several pieces of L-Au aerogel, the measured average density of our prepared L-Au aerogel is  $0.039 \pm 0.002 \,\mathrm{g \, cm^{-3}}$ , which is in line with the density range of typical aerogel (0.003–0.500 g cm<sup>-3</sup>) [41]. Besides, the surface area and porosity of S-Au aerogel and Au/C are also characterized (figures S5 and S6).

Figure 3(a) shows the TEM image of the prepared L-Au aerogel. The XRD pattern of the L-Au aerogel shown in figure 3(b) confirms the face-centered cubic (fcc) crystalline structure. The strongest diffraction peak appears in  $2\theta \approx 38.4^\circ$ , which belongs to the (111) facet of fcc Au. The polycrystalline structure of Au is further indicated by the SAED result shown in figure 3(c). All crystal planes measured by XRD are presented in SAED, and the brightness ratio of different crystal planes corresponds to the peak intensity ratio in XRD. Besides, higher-order crystal planes, such as (422) ( $2\theta \approx 135.4^\circ$ ), exceeding the XRD diffraction ability, are still visible in the SAED pattern.

Some typical structural defects such as twins, stacking faults and grain boundaries are observed in the high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) images (figures 3(d), S7(a)), which attributes to the LAL technology. During the gelation process of Au NPs, these defect structures

still retained, which has been reported in previous work [42]. The surface structure of L-Au aerogel was further investigated by HRTEM image and Fast Fourier transform (FFT) pattern shown in figure 3(e), which are along the  $[01\overline{1}]$  orientation. The (111) and (100) planes are marked according to the measured lattice spacing and the FFT pattern. The high-index facets can also be described as stepped form based on microfacet notion theory. For instance, the high-index facets (311) can be expressed as 2 (111)  $\times$  (100), including a terrace in two atomic widths of (111) and monatomic step of (100). Similarly, (422) and (533) facets can be expressed as 3  $(111) \times (100)$  and 4  $(111) \times (100)$ , respectively. The stepped structures on the L-Au aerogel surfaces composed of (111) and (100) planes have been observed in figure 3(e). More high-index facets are shown in figure S7(b). The direction and orientation of the high-index facets are random. Figure 3(f) also shows the existence of twin crystals and high-index facets structures (422) and (533), which are retained during the subsequent gel growth process [42]. The high-index facets are brought by the LAL technology. Classical molecular dynamics simulations have confirmed that a large number of under-coordinated Au atoms will be generated on the surface of Au NPs under a high-temperature environment and then form high-index facets [43]. But the high-index facets generated in high-temperature environments are metastable structures, which are usually difficult to maintain at room temperature. The LAL technology can provide localized high temperature (thousands of kelvins) [44]. The formation of L-Au NPs undergoes a rapid quenching process due to the large temperature difference between the high-temperature plasma and the liquid phase environment, so that the metastable structure of high-index facets can be preserved [44, 45]. In addition, the presence of twins and grain boundaries can make dislocations and other defects more stable [46, 47].

Pb-upd can be used to further characterize the surface structure of Au aerogels, since the Au surface facets are sensitive to the Pb-upd peak potentials of stripping waves. Figures 3(g) and (h) present the voltammetric profiles of S-Au and L-Au aerogels, respectively. The voltammetric profile of L-Au aerogel has a small peak at -0.48 V, which corresponds to the surface step/kink sites. This peak also shows two small characteristic peaks, indicating that the L-Au aerogel surface has at least two different high-index facets [48]. The peaks located at -0.34 V and -0.18 V correspond to the Au (111) and Au (110) facets, respectively, while the peak belonging to the Au (100) facet should be located at -0.23 V. The proportions of different surface facets in the L-Au and S-Au aerogels are calculated by integrating the peak areas (figure 3(i)) [49]. We found that the L-Au aerogel has significant surface step twist structures (high-index facets) than the S-Au aerogel.

Herein, EOR was selected to probe the electrocatalytic performance of the L-Au aerogel catalyst. The cyclic voltammogram (CV) curves of L-Au aerogel, S-Au aerogel, and Au/C were recorded in  $N_2$  saturated 1 M KOH solution

(figure 4(a)). The electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) of L-Au aerogel, S-Au aerogel, and Au/C were calculated based on the charge transfer during the reduction of AuO monolayer in the cathode scan [50], which are  $31.58 \text{ m}^2 \text{ g}^{-1}$ , 19.65 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>, and 9.36 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. Then, the mass activity (MA) of each catalyst was measured in a mixed solution (1 M KOH + 1 M ethanol) with  $N_2$  gas (figure 4(b)). The MA of L-Au aerogel reaches 665 mA mg<sup>-1</sup>, which are 1.7 times of S-Au aerogel (391 mA mg<sup>-1</sup>) and 4.6 times of Au/C (146 mA mg<sup>-1</sup>). The specific activity (SA) represents the intrinsic activity of the catalyst. The SA (normalized by ECSA) of L-Au aerogel  $(21.37 \text{A m}^{-2})$  is 1.1 times of S-Au aerogel  $(19.65 \text{ A m}^{-2})$  and 2.1 times of Au/C (10.32 A  $m^{-2}$ ). Besides, two EOR oxidation peaks appeared during the CV cycle (figure 4(b)), which correspond to the oxidation of ethanol through C2 pathway. This indicates that the final oxidation product is acetic acid [20]. The L-Au aerogels are compared with the representative Au catalysts in recent years (table 1). Although the forward/backward current density ratio  $(I_f/I_h)$  of the L-Au aerogel is not outstanding, the excellent ESCA and MA demonstrate the great catalytic activity of the L-Au aerogel for EOR. The lower  $I_{\rm f}/I_{\rm b}$  is due to the

acceleration of the reaction rate which results in more intermediates (such as CHCHO).

We visually compare the activities of the three catalysts in the histogram (figure 4(c)). The excellent electrocatalytic performance of L-Au aerogel is attributed to the rich defects and high-index facets, which can expose more active sites to improve MA, and increase the intrinsic activity. The durability of a catalyst is another important indicator to evaluate its catalytic performance. As shown in figure 4(d), after 3600 s chronoamperometric (CA) test at a voltage of 0.24 V, the MA of the L-Au aerogel still retains 108 mA mg<sup>-1</sup>, but that of S-Au aerogel is only 47 mA mg<sup>-1</sup> and the Au/C is almost no activity. Thus, the L-Au aerogel with high-index facets shows better stability. The atoms located at the high-index crystal planes have more dangling bonds, which may

help increase the adsorbability of catalyst. This will be further investigated in the next electrocatalytic experiment and DFT calculations.

The L-Au aerogel also provides excellent activity and stability for GOR (figures S8(a), (b)). GOR is the anode reaction of a glucose biofuel cell, which has been widely used in biology, medical and other fields. The electrochemical test shows that L-Au aerogel has a widespread catalytic application, and this benefits from the special structure of the aerogel, especially the high-index facets.

To further investigate the effect of high-index facets of L-Au aerogel on the promotion of catalytic activity, we constructed the Au (111) and the high-index facets Au (311) to implement DFT calculations based on the HRTEM image of L-Au aerogel shown in figure 3(e). The cut-off energy was set as 450 eV, and Monkhorst Pack grid of  $3 \times 3 \times 1$ was used for Brillouin zone sampling. The geometric structures were optimized with the convergence criterion of  $10^{-5}$  eV total energy and 0.01 eV·Å<sup>-1</sup> force on each atom. The unit cell of Au was optimized and the lattice constant was 4.17 Å. The four-layer Au (111) and Au (311) surface were cleaved with a vacuum layer of 20 Å to avoid the interaction among the slab mirrors. All the atoms in the models were enabled to relax. DFT-D3 van der Waals correction was used. More details about DFT simulation can be found in the tables S1-S3. The simulation results demonstrated in figure 5 shows that the adsorption of CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>OH on Au (311) is exothermic, while that on Au (111) is

endothermic, which means that ethanol adsorption is thermodynamically stable on Au (311). The dehydrogenation process on Au (311) in the subsequent reaction is enhanced. In addition, it can also be proved that the high-index facets improve the adsorption of Au by calculating the density of states of Au atoms at different positions (figures S9, S10). The d-band center of Au<sub>20</sub> on Au (311) in the outermost layer is higher than that of Au<sub>19</sub> and Au<sub>18</sub> in the inner layers, which indicates Au<sub>20</sub> atomic positions have the strongest adsorption. However, the d-band centers of Au atoms at different positions on the (111) plane are almost the same and lower than that on the (311) plane. This demonstrates that the Au (111) has weaker adsorption, which is consistent with the free energies in EOR of Au (111) shown in figure 5(a). Thus, the under-coordinated atoms on Au (311), such as Au<sub>20</sub>, contribute to the change on the ethanol reaction kinetics [53]. This improves the weaker Au adsorption of reactants so that the catalytic activity of Au can be optimized. Although the strong adsorbability of Au (311) makes the desorption energy barrier of acetic acid higher, this is acceptable because the adsorption of acetic acid on Au is originally much weaker than that of Pt, Pd metals [54].

#### 4. Conclusions

In conclusion, we have obtained Au aerogel catalyst with rich defects and high-index facets by using LAL technology, which performs excellent catalytic activity in the EOR and GOR. The 3D porous structure and the rich defects of the aerogel provide more active sites. In addition, the undercoordinated atoms on the high-index facets can further enhance the adsorption of ethanol and glucose. The present work may facilitate the development of Au-based catalysts.

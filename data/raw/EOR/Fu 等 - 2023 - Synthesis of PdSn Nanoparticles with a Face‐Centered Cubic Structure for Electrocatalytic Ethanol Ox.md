Owing to the advantages of large energy density, excellent conversion efficiency, and safety for storage, direct ethanol fuel cells (DEFCs) possess an extensive range of applications in alkaline mediums. In this study, we successfully synthesize the PdSn nanoparticles (NPs) with a different molar ratio of Pd/Sn by a simple one-step method. The alloyed PdSn NPs present higher electrocatalytic activity and better stability than that of the commercial Pd/C toward ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR). Especially, the PdSn@NP-2 displayed the best electrocatalytic performance among the as-prepared samples, the current density for EOR in the alkaline condition of which can even approach 2463.8 mAmg <sup>1</sup> , approximately 3.6 times of the commercial Pd/C (700 mAmg <sup>1</sup> ). Meanwhile, on the base of the electrochemical measurement, it is also observed that increasing temperature and concentrations of KOH/C2H5OH for PdSn NPs positively affect on the current density of the above samples.

## **Introduction**

Direct ethanol fuel cells (DEFCs), an advisable portable power source, hold the advantages of large energy density, excellent conversion efficiency, and storage safety among different kinds of fuel cells.[1–6] Although pure palladium (Pd) is extensively considered as an excellent anode catalyst, the disadvantages of low storage, high cost, and poor anti-toxic property still obstruct its large-scale utilization.[7–9] Therefore, Pd-based bimetallic alloy naturally becomes popular because it incorporates the two atoms and fully uses them.[10–12] Also, the inherent electron structures of Pd surfaces and interfaces can be changed by forming the alloy.[13–15] In addition, introducing atoms with different radii than Pd atoms will change the unit cell size, and this may weaken the adsorption of intermediates such as CO molecules, thereby improving the electrocatalytic performance.[16–18] Nowadays, lots of efforts have been conducted to search for suitable alternative elements, for example, Pd/Cu,[19] Pd/Bi,[20] Pd/Sn,[21,22] and Pd/Ag.[10,23] Herein, the Sn element is introduced to form the alloy, and they show greatly better-promoting effects on EOR and bring the crystal expansion effect and electronic effect.[24–27]

PdSn NPs have attracted widespread attention since they exhibited better catalytic activity than the pure Pd.[28,29] The morphologies of the material are crucial to their activity performance.[30–32] Nowadays, researchers have made efforts to search for alloys along with different morphologies, such as nanoparticles, nanosheets, nanonetworks, and so on.[33,34] The NPs often possess regular arrangement, free-standing structure, outstanding catalytic performance, and have even more promising prospects than other morphologies.[26,35–37] In general, the nano-scaled PdSn NPs exposed large enough surface/ interface areas and provided lots of electrochemically active sites, which is beneficial to the reaction on the catalysts.[9,21,38,39]

In this paper, a simple one-step method was used to synthesize PdSn nanoparticles with a zero-dimension bimetallic structure. In this study, SnCl2 ·2H2O works as the precursors, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) as a surfactant, and glucose as the reducing agent. The molar ratio of Pd/Sn is varied from 3:1 to 1 :1, controlled by changing the mass of SnCl2 ·2H2O under a certain amount of PdCl2. The PdSn@NP-2 has an excellent electrocatalytic activity for ethanol oxidation reaction with a current density of 2463.8 mAmg <sup>1</sup> , which is much higher than that of PdSn@NP-1, PdSn@NP-3 NPs, and commercial Pd/C corresponding to 2250, 1800 and 700 mAmg <sup>1</sup> , respectively. Moreover, the mechanisms of PdSn NPs for EOR are further analyzed in detail by changing the electrocatalytic temperature, and OH /ethanol concentrations and a positive effect is observed between the current density and the above factors.

## **Results and discussion**

Figure 1. TEM images (a–c), HRTEM images (d-f), and SAED patterns (insets of (d–f)) of the (a and d) PdSn@NP-1, (b and e) PdSn@NP-2, and (c and f) PdSn@NP-2

results show that the atomic ratio of Pd/Sn is measured to be 85/15, 80/20, and 71/29 for PdSn@NP-1, PdSn@NP-2, and PdSn@NP-3, respectively. The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images in Figure 1d–f display that the Pd (111) plane is 2.26, 2.34, and 2.38 Å for PdSn@NP-1, PdSn@NP-2, and PdSn@NP-3, respectively. The (111) plane increases as the tin elements' content increases since the tin atoms possess slightly larger atomic radii than the palladium atoms counterparts, and this would lead to lattice expansion. [40,41] The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns in Figure 1d–f show there are several

diffraction rings from inside to outside, corresponding to (111), (200), (220), and (311) planes. The brightness rings indicate the excellent crystallinity of the PdSn@NPs.<sup>[22]</sup>

HADDF-STEM images of the PdSn@NP-2 (Figure 2) show that the palladium and tin elements are distributed in the NPs uniformly, indicating a binary alloy is generated.<sup>[34]</sup>

The crystal structures of the PdSn@NPs can be determined by XRD patterns (Figure 3a), where the (111), (200), (220), and (311) faces of crystalline Pd [JCPDS no. 46-1043] correspond from the diffraction peaks of PdSn@NP-2 at about 39.14, 45.42,

66.94 and 80.22 degrees, respectively. In addition, the peaks shifted negatively to smaller angles as the doping content of Sn increased. The (111) peaks are 39.36, 39.14, and 39.00 for PdSn@NP-1, PdSn@NP-2, and PdSn@NP-3, respectively. This is because the incorporation of Sn atoms with relatively smaller radii into Pd atoms would lead to crystal expansion.

XPS techniques are carried out on the inherent electron structures of palladium atoms and tin atoms within the alloyed Pd—Sn NPs (Figure 3b, c). The Pd elements exist mainly in Pd (0) state but few of them exist in Pd (II) state due to oxidation in the air. The binding energy of Pd 3d<sub>5/2</sub> for PdSn@NP-1, PdSn@NP-2, and PdSn@NP-3 are 335.8, 335.7, and 335.6 eV, respectively, and their values shifted to a negative value as more Sn doping.<sup>[27,43]</sup> The compressive strain introduced to the doping of Sn atoms with larger radii would enlarge the *d*-bandwidth since the overlay of the *d* states between neighboring Pd atoms would increase. Therefore, the *d*-band center would shift to a negative value relative to the Fermi level to keep the fixed *d* occupancy.

The CV method is conducted to investigate and study the electrochemical properties of the PdSn@NPs, where the associated CV curves in aqueous 0.5 M  $\rm H_2SO_4$  solution and 1.0 M KOH solution are shown in Figure 4a, and b, respectively. A pair of peaks corresponding to adsorption and desorption (eq. 1) can be observed between -0.35 and -0.15 V in acidic medium and -0.90 and -0.70 V in alkaline medium, respectively. During the forward scanning, the hydroxide would absorb on the Pd (eq. 2). The Pd was oxidated to Pd–O (eq. 3) at a positive

potential at a relative potential, and then Pd–O can be reduced to Pd (eq. 4) during the backward scanning. The electrochemically active surface areas (ECSAs) value can be calculated by the coulometric charge (ECSAs =  $Q/(405\mu\text{C/cm}^{-2}\text{ mg}_{Pd})$ ) in the area of reduction of Pd–O. The ECSAs value is 42.38, 59.80, and 37.67 for PdSn@NP-1, PdSn@NP-2, and PdSn@NP-3, respectively, which is 2.81, 4.04, and 2.54 times higher than that of commercial Pd/C (Figure 4c). Among them, the PdSn@NP-2 presents the highest ECSAs value that would be favorable for the oxidation of ethanol.

To evaluate the electrocatalytic activity and stability of the as-made PdSn@NPs, the catalysts are measured in an aqueous 1.0 M KOH/1.0 M  $C_2H_3OH$  solution (Figure 4d). The on-set potential ( $E_0$ ) and the forward current density ( $j_f$ ) are the two key parameters to evaluate the electrocatalytic activity of the as-prepared PdSn@NPs. The order of the catalytic current is PdSn@NP-2 > PdSn@NP-1 > PdSn@NP-3 > Pd/C. PdSn@NP-2 with the largest negative onset potential has the highest current density, indicating that PdSn@NP-2 exhibits the best

electrocatalytic mass activity (2463.8 mA mg<sup>-1</sup>) among PdSn@NPs.

The ideal process for EOR undergoes a 12-electron pathway ( $C_1$  pathway). In this way, ethanol molecules would oxidate to carbonate or carbon dioxide (eq. 5). However, the  $C_2$  pathway takes place more often because of the difficult breakdown of the C–C bond. Therefore, ethanol would oxidate to acetic acid through four electrons (eq. 6).

The ethanol and hydroxide molecular (eq. 7) would absorb on the Pd. The Pd-CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>OH<sub>ads</sub> would quickly oxidate to Pd-CH<sub>3</sub>CO<sub>ads</sub> (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OH $\rightarrow$ CH<sub>3</sub>CHOH $\rightarrow$ CH<sub>3</sub>CHO $\rightarrow$ CH<sub>3</sub>CO) during forwarding scanning (eq. 8). Afterward, the Pd-CH<sub>3</sub>CO<sub>ads</sub> would react with Pd-OH<sub>ads</sub> to form Pd-CH<sub>3</sub>COOH (eq. 9, 10). During the reverse scan, the C<sub>2</sub> intermediate can be further removed and new Pd atoms are exposed, leading to an increase in the current density. The ratio of  $j_{\rm f}$  to  $j_{\rm br}$  that is  $j_{\rm f}/j_{\rm br}$ , can be used to compare the anti-toxicity of the PdSn@NPs. The value of  $j_{\rm f}/j_{\rm br}$  is 1.27, 1.16, 0.96, and 0.73 for PdSn@NP-1, PdSn@NP-2, PdSn@NP-3, and commercial Pd/C, respectively.

Tafel slopes are used to compare the energy barrier of the PdSn@NPs (Figure 5). The lower Tafel slope indicates the better

kinetics of the electrocatalysts. The order of the Tafel slope is PdSn@NP-2 < PdSn@NP-1 < PdSn@NP-3 < Pd/C. This indicates that the PdSn@NP-2 has the lowest reaction barrier, resulting in the highest electrocatalytic activity that is consistent with the CV analysis above.<sup>[44]</sup>

To find out the kinetics of EOR, the CV curves (Figure 6a) are conducted at varied scanning speeds. A clear linear relationship between  $j_f$  and  $v_{1/2}$  (Figure 6b) can be obtained and this means that diffusion controls the kinetics for EOR.

Long-term stability is an indispensable parameter for evaluating the electrochemical properties of the PdSn@NPs and the corresponding long-termed CV curves are presented in Figure 6c. [36,41] The current density of the PdSn@NP-2 rises in the first few cycles and reaches the peak (2463.8 mAmg<sup>-1</sup>) in the 14<sup>th</sup> cycle. It can maintain 65% of the maximum value after long-term cycling (Figure 6d), which is 21.9 times that of the commercial Pd/C counterpart. [44] The PdSn@NP-2 always possesses the highest value of the mass activity, indicating the best long-term stability of the PdSn@NPs. The electrocatalytic mass activity of the PdSn@NPs is much better than the commercial Pd/C counterpart. In summary, the PdSn@NP-2 has the best electrocatalytic mass activity, anti-toxic properties, lowest energy barrier, and long-term stability.

The catalytic media and temperature are very sensitive to the electrocatalytic activity toward EOR. In Figure 7a, the mass activity of the PdSn@NP-2 raised from 202 mA mg<sup>-1</sup> to 2463 mA mg<sup>-1</sup>, and the relationship between the mass activity and the  $C_{\text{KOH}}$  is shown in Figure 7c. The increase of the hydroxide can be favorable for each step of oxidation of C2 products to acetic acid. The reaction order vs. KOH can be determined by the slope of current density and  $C_{KOH}$ , which is calculated to be 0.925, -0.962, and -0.968, at the potential of -0.3, -0.2, and -0.1 V, respectively. In addition, the mass activity of the PdSn@NP-2 raised from 230 mA mg<sup>-1</sup> to 2463 mA mg<sup>-1</sup> (Figure 7b), and the relationship between the mass activity and the  $C_{\rm C2H5OH}$  is shown in Figure 7d. The ethanol molecule is the reactant of EOR. Therefore, the increase of  $C_{C2H5OH}$  can be favorable for each step of oxidation of ethanol. The reaction order vs. ethanol is 0.429, 0.518, and 0.641, at the potential of -0.4, -0.3, and -0.2 V, respectively.

In Figure 7e, the mass activity rises from 2463 mA mg<sup>-1</sup> to 3237 mA mg<sup>-1</sup> when the temperature change from 30 °C to 60 °C, and the Arrhenius plots are shown in Figure 7f. More active sites would expose as the electrocatalytic temperature rises, leading to the rise of electrocatalytic current density. The mass activity of PdSn@NPs was improved under the conditions of higher catalytic temperature and higher KOH or ethanol concentration (Figure 8 and Table S2).

The chronoamperometric (CA) curves further show the long-term stability of the PdSn@NPs (Figure 9). Obviously, PdSn@NP-2 always maintains the highest mass activity, which is much higher than PdSn@NPs-1, PdSn@NP-2 and Pd/C, further indicating that PdSn@NP-2 has significantly enhanced electrocatalytic activity and stability. In summary, the PdSn@NP-2 has the best electrocatalytic mass activity, anti-toxic properties, lowest energy barrier, and long-term stability.

### Conclusion

PdSn nanoparticles with specific structures were synthesized by a facile one-step method using glucose as the reducing agent. The electronic structure of palladium within the surface and interfaces of the PdSn NPs was adjusted by changing the doping content of tin atoms. It is worth noting that the introduction of Sn into PdSn NPs affected the morphology and structure and enhanced the electrocatalytic activity for EOR. The PdSn@NP-2 possesses an excellent catalytic current of 2463.8 mAmg<sup>-1</sup> among all the samples. Furthermore, when increasing the temperatures or concentrations of KOH/ethanol, the current density of all the as-prepared rise as well. These results provide adequate information for designing and preparing more efficient and stable Pd-based bimetallic nanostructured catalysts for fuel cells with a wide range of potential applications.

#### **Experimental section**

#### **Materials and Reagents**

Palladium (II) chloride (PdCl $_2$ , 99%), tin (II) chloride dihydrate (SnCl $_2 \cdot 2H_2O$ , 98.0%), glucose, hydrochloric acid (HCl), N, N-dimethylformamide (DMF), potassium hydroxide (KOH), hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), and absolute ethanol (C $_2H_5OH$ ) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd.

#### Preparation of PdSn@NPs.

Taking the PdSn@NP-2 NPs as an example,  $SnCl_2 \cdot 2H_2O$  (11.28 mg), hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB, 100 mg), and glucose (200 mg) were mixed in a 50 mL beaker with 15 mL DMF as the solvent. This mixture was stirred for 30 mins at 80 °C. Then 17.7 mg of PdCl<sub>2</sub> was dissolved by abundant hydrochloric acid and injected into the precursor solution, kept heating for 3 h at 90 °C, and finally obtained PdSn@NP-2. The masses of  $SnCl_2 \cdot 2H_2O$  for PdSn@NP-1 and PdSn@NP-3 are 7.52 mg and 20.57 mg, respectively.

#### **Material Characterization**

The morphologies and structures of the samples were analyzed by a JEOL JSM-7800F scanning electron microscope (SEM) and a JEOL JEM-2100 plus transmission electron microscope (TEM). The crystallographic information and composition were performed by a Rigaku Ultima IV X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Cu K $\alpha$  radiation  $\lambda=0.15418$  nm). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) technique was used to record the valence structure of the prepared through an ESCALab220i-XL electronic spectrometer using 300 W A K $\alpha$  radiation

#### **Electrochemical Measurements**

All of the electrochemical measurements were performed by a CHI660 electrochemical station with a typical three-electrode system at a fixed temperature. [10] A platinum foil worked as the counter electrode and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) in acid solution or a Hg/HgO electrode in alkaline condition as the reference electrode.

# Electrochemical Oxidation of Formic Acid on PdM (M=Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, and Ag) Alloy Nanoparticles with Low M Content: A Comparative Study

Azar Gharib<sup>[a]</sup> and Ali Arab<sup>\*[a]</sup>

PdM (M=Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, and Ag) alloy nanoparticles with low M content were prepared using a chemical method and characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), energy dispersive X-ray (EDX), EDX mapping, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses. The electro-oxidation of formic acid on these samples was investigated by linear sweep voltammetry, cyclic voltam-

metry, and chronoamperometry in  $H_2SO_4$  solution. The PdAg electrocatalyst demonstrated superior electrocatalytic activity toward the oxidation of formic acid with the mass activity of 1980 mA mg $^{-1}$ <sub>Pd</sub> which was significantly higher than the mass activity of commercial Pd/C electrocatalysts. Additionally, the PdAg electrocatalyst had the best CO poisoning tolerance as well as the best stability in the considered solution.

#### Introduction

Renewable liquid fuels can play a pragmatic role in combatting vast greenhouse gas emissions and increasing energy dependency in many countries. Direct liquid fuel cells (DLFCs) are the desired source of renewable energy, driven via formic acid, methanol, hydrogen, or other chemicals, owing to their minimal emission of toxin materials, high energy density, and efficiency.[1-3] In recent years the direct formic acid fuel cell (DFAFC) has attracted more attention compared to the other types of DLFCs because of its low fuel crossover, excellent fuel flexibility, low-temperature dependence, and low environmental impact. In comparison with hydrogen, FA is a safer and more environmentally friendly fuel, and it is also easier to store and handle FA.[4-7] Palladium-based materials are now considered attractive electrocatalysts for usage in DFAFCs due to their outstanding anti-poisoning capacity and lower oxidation overvoltage. With the advancement of experimental methodologies, a better understanding of the mechanism for formic acid oxidation reaction (FAOR) has emerged. [8,9] The FA oxidation reaction occurs in two separate ways including dehydrogenation (direct) and dehydration (indirect) paths.[10-13] Direct oxidation of FA is accompanied by a dehydrogenation reaction that produces CO<sub>2</sub> via one or more active intermediates  $(HCOOH \rightarrow CO_2 + 2H^+ + 2e)$ . The dehydration of FA to  $CO_{ads}$ intermediate is involved in the indirect reaction pathway. CO<sub>ads</sub> intermediates may poison the electrode or be oxidized to produce CO<sub>2</sub> depending on the applied electrode potential  $(HCOOH \rightarrow CO_{ads} + H_2O \rightarrow CO_2 + 2H^+ + 2e)$ . When compared to the indirect pathway, the direct pathway requires less overpotential and occurs in more negative potentials. Pt and Pd metals are both excellent catalysts for FA electro-oxidation. [14-16] The indirect pathway of FA oxidation on Pt is limited by producing CO intermediates that accumulate on the Pt surface and block active sites, while oxidation of FA on the surface of Pd occurs in the direct dehydrogenation pathway to form CO<sub>2</sub>. [17] Because Pd has a good catalytic performance and a high tolerance against poisoning with CO-like intermediates, it is regarded as a promising electro-catalyst for FA oxidation. Furthermore, other parameters such as the extent of the catalyst, morphology of the catalyst, and carbon-supporting material all have an impact on the performance of Pd-based catalysts. [17-24]

Pd electrocatalytic properties can be improved by doping or alloying with foreign elements. Foreign elements can cause defects and increase the number of FAOR surface-active sites.

Various Pd-based electrocatalysts, such as Cu, $^{[25-42]}$  Cd, $^{[43-45]}$  Ni, $^{[46-53]}$  Au, $^{[54-58]}$  Cr, $^{[59]}$  Co, $^{[60-65]}$  Zn, $^{[66]}$  Fe, $^{[67-72]}$  Ag, $^{[73-76]}$  Sn, $^{[77-84]}$  Ru, $^{[85-89]}$  Pb, $^{[90-92]}$  Bi, $^{[93-97]}$  Fe, $^{[98-101]}$  Pt, $^{[102-105]}$  and P $^{[106]}$  have been studied so far. Second-element doping can improve not only the FAOR activity of Pd through electronic and structural effects but also the catalytic durability due to changes in surface physicochemical properties. $^{[107-109]}$ 

In our previous studies<sup>[43–45]</sup> we investigated FA oxidation on bimetallic Pd-Cd samples with different Pd to Cd ratios and we observed that bimetallic Pd-Cd samples are more reactive for FA oxidation compared to the pure Pd sample. Therefore, in the present study, we consider other metals including Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, and Ag to investigate their effects on the Pd sample toward FA oxidation. The main goal of the present study is to investigate the effects of the addition of small amounts of these metals to Pd. The activity of prepared samples for FA oxidation as well as their stability in the sulphuric acid solution is investigated using different electrochemical techniques at room temperature (25 °C).

# **Results and Discussion**

#### **Electrocatalysts characterization**

Figure 1 presents SEM images along with the size distribution histograms of the prepared PdAg, PdNi, PdFe, PdCr, PdCo, and PdMn alloy nanoparticles. All of the samples have circular particles with a cauliflower structure that can be observed in some of the samples. The particle size distribution and average diameter were determined in Digimizer software by considering about 700 particles in arbitrarily selected areas. Table 2 shows the average particle size along with the corresponding standard deviations derived from SEM analysis where for all prepared samples the particle size is lower than 100 nm. The smallest average particle size (52 nm) is related to the PdAg sample.

Figure S1 of supplementary material shows the EDX analyses of the prepared samples. The atomic content (%) of the additive metal (M) was obtained 5.9, 6.8, 6.3, 7.8, 3.2, and 4.7, for PdAg, PdNi, PdFe, PdCr, PdCo, and PdMn samples

respectively. Therefore, the content of the second metal compared to Pd is low for all the prepared PdM samples. The EDX mapping of electrocatalysts is also depicted in Figure S2 of supplementary material where the uniform distribution of elements is visible on the surface of electrocatalysts. Figure 2 shows the XRD pattern of Pd, PdAg, PdNi, PdFe, PdCr, PdCo, and PdMn samples, which can be used to investigate the samples' structural features. PdAg (JCPDS No. 96-150-9120), PdNi (JCPDS No. 96-152-3344 and No. 96-231-0170), PdFe (JCPDS No. 96-152-3258), PdCr (JCPDS No. 96-152-5147), PdCo (JCPDS No. 96-152-4901), and PdMn (JCPDS No. 96-152-2755) have all been crystallized in the Fm <sup>3</sup> m space groups in the face-centered cubic (fcc) structure. The distinct diffraction peaks and X-ray results that confirm alloy formation for all samples are also obvious in Figure 2. Additionally, Figure 2 depicts the diffraction peaks that emerged for all samples. Equation 1 can be used to calculate the crystallite size (*D*) [110]

$$D = \frac{0.9 \ \lambda}{\beta \cos \theta} \tag{1}$$

In this equation, λ is the wavelength of X-ray (λ=1.5406 Å), *θ* is the angle of (111) peak, and b is the width (in radians) of (111) peak at half height.

The obtained values of average crystallite size are presented in Table 2 where the PdAg sample has the smallest particle size in good agreement with the SEM results.

Typical TEM micrographs and size distribution histograms of PdAg, PdNi, PdFe, PdCr, PdCo, and PdMn electrocatalysts are shown in Figure 3. On the carbon support, the metal particle distribution is heterogeneous, with some agglomerates forming over the carbon particles. The particles in the examined samples had a quasi-spherical shape and various size distributions, as seen in Figure 3. By selecting more than 100 particles at random from the matching TEM picture, the particle size distribution for

each catalyst can be evaluated. The particle sizes of all catalysts as well as the corresponding standard deviations are reported in Table 2. As demonstrated in Figure 3 and Table 2, the measured particles in all samples had a diameter of less than 100 nm. According to these measurements, it is clear that the average size of all samples is in the same range (40 to 50 nm). The PdAg sample with an average particle size of 41 nm has the smallest average size and the PdMn sample with an average particle size of 49 nm has the largest nanoparticle size which is in good agreement with the results obtained using SEM and XRD analyses.

#### **Formic acid oxidation**

In the absence and presence of 0.5 M formic acid (FA), cyclic voltammograms of prepared samples in H2SO4 (0.5 M) solution are recorded and the obtained results are shown in Figure 4. In addition to the considerable increase in anodic current density in the presence of FA, two oxidation peaks (A1, and A2) are detected in the anodic direction for all of the considered electrocatalysts. The first peak (A1) around 0.30–0.55 V/RHE is related to the direct FA oxidation (*HCOOH* ! *CO*<sup>2</sup> þ 2*H*<sup>þ</sup> þ 2*e*).[43,111–114] The second peak (A2), which is less intense than the A1 peak and occurs around 0.6– 0.8 V/RHE, is related to the indirect oxidation of FA and the production of adsorbed CO intermediates (*HCOOH* ! *COads* þ *H*2*O* ! *CO*<sup>2</sup> þ 2*H*<sup>þ</sup> þ 2*e*).[43,111–114]

In the reverse (cathodic) scan the oxidation of FA is continued with lower intensity because of probable poisoning of the surface by adsorbed CO intermediates produced from incomplete oxidation of FA.

The cyclic voltammograms of all samples in the presence of formic acid are compared in Figure 5. The largest value of

anodic peak current density (1980 mA mg $^{-1}_{Pd}$ ) is associated with the PdAg sample, showing that this sample is more reactive for FA oxidation than the others.

The effect of CO poisoning was also investigated for prepared electrocatalysts. For this purpose, the solution containing  $0.5 H_2SO_4 + 0.5 M$  FA was saturated with the CO for 20 min and then cyclic voltammetry (CV) experiments were recorded. Figure 6 shows these CV plots for PdAg, PdNi, PdFe, PdCr, PdCo, and PdMn electrocatalysts. For comparison, the CV plots in a similar electrolyte without CO were also presented. Table 3 summarizes the peak current density of FA oxidation in the presence and absence of CO, as well as its variations. The results display that the PdAg sample shows the minimum reduction of current density in the presence of CO, while the PdMn sample shows the maximum reduction. As a result, the PdAg sample appears to be the most effective sample against poisoning with adsorbed CO intermediate. Additionally, According to this table, the poisoning of samples with CO intermediate can be ordered as PdAg < PdCo < PdNi < PdFe < PdCr < PdMn.

Table 4 summarizes the values of peak potential ( $E_{\rm pa}$ ), onset potential ( $E_{\rm onset}$ ), and peak current density (mass activity) corresponding to the A<sub>1</sub> peak. The calculated values of electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) are also collected in Table 4. The ECSA values are calculated by two different

methods including 1. The integration of the CV peak corresponds to palladium oxide reduction (Figure 4) and 2. The integration of linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) peak corresponding to CO oxidation in the CO stripping experiment (Figure 7). The details of these methods are completely explained in our previous study.[45] Table 4 indicates that all bimetallic samples have larger ECSA than the Pd sample and the largest value of ECSA is related to the PdCo sample. The values of peak current density related to the A1 peak were normalized using the Pd content of samples and the obtained results (mass activity) are reported in Table 4. The largest value of the mass activity (1980 mAmg <sup>1</sup> Pd) is related to the PdAg sample while the PdAg sample has the smallest value of ECSA. For a better understanding of this matter, we calculated the amount of Pd on the surface of electrocatalysts as described by Bergeret and coworkers.[115] In this regard, the dispersion (*D*) which is the fraction of surface atoms is calculated and the results are presented in Table 4. The values of mass activity normalized using the surface Pd amount are reported in the last column of Table 4 where the PdAg sample still has the maximum value of the mass activity. Considering the results of Table 4 indicate that the value of Pd on the surface of the PdAg sample is larger than the other sample and perhaps it causes the larger mass activity of this sample.

The effect of potential scan rate on the behavior of the cyclic voltammograms of prepared electrocatalysts in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution containing FA (0.5 M) is presented in Figure S3 of supplementary material. The potential of the A1 peak moves to increasingly positive values as the scan rate rises indicating irreversible oxidation of FA on the studied samples. For example, the anodic peak potential values of A1 for PdAg range from 0.330 V/RHE to 0.372 V/RHE, PdNi range from 0.328 V/RHE to 0.367 V/RHE, PdFe range from 0.322 V/RHE to 0.349 V/RHE, PdCr range from 0.322 V/RHE to 0.347 V/RHE, PdCo range from 0.322 V/RHE to 0.342 V/RHE, and PdMn range from 0.327 V/RHE to 0.337 V/RHE. The influence of H2SO4, as well as FA

concentration on the LSV of the prepared sample's reactivity toward FA oxidation, is also examined. The obtained results are presented in Figures. S4 and S5 of supplementary material, respectively. The concentrations of H2SO4 in the 0.25 M to 1.00 M range are examined and for all of the studied samples, the greatest anodic current density is detected at 0.5 M concentration of H2SO4. As a result, the optimum H2SO4 concentration for PdAg, PdNi, PdFe, PdCr, PdCo, and PdMn samples is 0.5 M.

The concentration of FA in the 0.1 M to 0.5 M range was studied at the optimum concentration of sulfuric acid. It is observed that raising the FA concentration in the region of 0.1 M to 0.5 M continually increases the anodic current density. The reaction order for the FA is also determined from the slope of log *i*pa versus log *C* plot, as shown in Figure S5 of supplementary material. The obtained values are 0.37, 0.61, 0.69, 1.05, 0.99, and 0.94 for PdAg, PdNi, PdFe, PdCr, PdCo, and PdMn samples respectively.

Table 5 compares the results of the current investigation with those of earlier studies. The highest mass activity (1980 mAg <sup>1</sup> Pd) obtained for the PdAg sample in this work is higher than that of the Pd/xCuO-CNT,[17] Pd6.3Cd,[45] ordered Pd3Fe/C,[99] PdFe alloy,[100] CuPd@Pd,[109] Twisted Pd-Cu nano chain,[116] PdCu Nanocatalysts,[117] Pd/rGO,[118] Pd NCNs,[119] Pd@N-C NFs,[120] Pd30La70/rGO,[121] Ni@Pd0.06 core-shell nanocrystals,[122] and Pd/GA[123] samples. Furthermore, the mass activity of the PdAg sample is larger than the commercial Pd/C values of 0.49 Ag <sup>1</sup> Pd, [36] 0.3 Ag <sup>1</sup> Pd, [95] 0.53 Ag <sup>1</sup> Pd, [109] and 0.24 Ag <sup>1</sup> Pd. [116]

Figure 8 presents the obtained chronoamperograms (CAs) at a potential of 0.33 V/RHE for PdAg, PdNi, PdFe, PdCr, PdCo, and PdMn samples. The potential of 0.33 V/RHE is near the peak potential related to the A1 peak for all samples. From this figure, it is clear that the PdAg sample has a higher steady-state current density compared to the PdNi, PdFe, PdCr, PdCo, and PdMn samples. As a consequence, the PdAg sample is more stable than the other samples under FA oxidation conditions, which is consistent with the CV results. Additionally, the CA experiments were done after different immersion times (0 h to 96 h) of the samples in the considered solution. Figure 9 presents the obtained results for the PdAg sample while for other samples the obtained results are presented in Figure S6

of supplementary material. The steady-state current densities of all studied samples are collected in Table 6 for different immersion times. The results of Table 6 confirm that the PdAg sample is more stable compared to the other samples because of the lower variation of steady-state current density.

## **Conclusions**

In this work, we synthesized bimetallic PdM (M=Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, and Ag) electrocatalysts using a simple chemical method. Different techniques including FE-SEM, EDX, EDX mapping, XRD, and TEM were employed for the characterization of prepared samples. The analyses showed that the particle sizes in all samples are less than 100 nm and all prepared samples have a low content of M (less than 5% w/w). The formation of the alloy was also observed in the XRD analyses. The FA electrooxidation on the prepared samples in H2SO4 solution was investigated using different electrochemical techniques. The results of the present study showed that all PdM samples had better electrocatalytic activity for the oxidation of formic acid compared to the pure Pd sample. The highest electrocatalytic activity was observed for PdAg electrocatalyst with the mass activity of 1980 mAmg <sup>1</sup> Pd which was significantly larger than the mass activity reported for commercial Pd/C electrocatalyst.

# Ethanol Oxidation via 12-Electron Pathway on Spiky Au@AuPd Nanoparticles Assisted by Near-Infrared Light

Mengmeng Zhang, Xiang Zhang, Min Lv, Xinru Yue, Zhaoke Zheng,\* and Haibing Xia\*

In this work, ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) via 12-electron (C1-12e) pathway on spiky Au@AuPd nanoparticles (NPs) with ultrathin AuPd alloy shells is achieved in alkaline media with the assistance of the near-infrared (NIR) light. It is found that OH radicals can be produced from the OH<sub>ads</sub> species adsorbed on the surfaces of Pd atoms led by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect of spiky Au@AuPd NPs under the irradiation of NIR light. Moreover, OH radicals play the key role for the achievement of EOR proceeded by the desirable C1-12e pathway because OH radicals can directly break the C-C bonds of ethanol. Accordingly, the electrocatalytic performance of spiky Au@AuPd NPs toward EOR under NIR light is greatly improved. For instance, their mass activity can be up to 33.2 A mg<sub>pd</sub><sup>-1</sup> in the 0.5 M KOH solution containing 0.5 M ethanol, which is about 158 times higher than that of commercial Pd/C catalysts (0.21 A mg<sub>pd</sub><sup>-1</sup>) and is better than those of the state-of-the-art Pd-based catalysts reported in literature thus far, to the best of our knowledge. Moreover, their highest mass activity can be further improved to 118.3 A  $mg_{pd}^{-1}$  in the 1.5 M KOH solution containing 1.25 M ethanol.

1. Introduction

Currently, the development of direct ethanol fuel cells (DEFCs) is mainly hindered by low oxidation efficiency and slow kinetics of ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) on their anodes. [1-4] Pd-based catalysts as one of the most promising anode catalysts used in DEFCs have been widely studied. [5-9] To improve the energy efficiency of DEFCs, it is desirable to achieve the occurrence of a complete oxidation process of ethanol into CO2 with the transfer of 12 electrons and the cleavage of the C-C bond (C1-12e pathway, Equation 1), instead of partial oxidation process of ethanol into acetate involving four electrons transfer without the cleavage of C-C bond (C2-4e pathway, Equation 2).[10-15] However, EOR catalyzed by most Pd-based catalysts still mainly proceeds in C2-4e pathway, instead of expected C1-12e pathway. [3,16-20] And the main strategy for improving performance of Pd-based catalysts toward EOR is to improve the selection of C1-12e pathway by rational design of Pd-based catalysts (such as metallic alloys or transition metal oxide

hybrids).<sup>[21–25]</sup> Despite great efforts made in past decades, it is still a great challenge to achieve an efficient C–C bond cleavage.

It is known that OH radicals can promote the cleavage of C–C bonds in organic molecules to generate CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O finally because of its strong oxidation ability. In addition, OH radicals can be easily generated from OH<sup>-</sup> ions at the interface between metals and semiconductors with the assistance of plasmon or photo-enhanced processes.<sup>[26–28]</sup> However, it is rather tough to generate OH radicals from OH<sup>-</sup> ions at Au–Pd interfaces. Fortunately, the active OH<sub>ads</sub> species, which

are derived from OH<sup>-</sup> ions and adsorbed on the surfaces of Pd-based catalysts,<sup>[29,30]</sup> may be converted into OH radicals under the further assistance of an external light source. Therefore, it is possible that the EOR catalyzed by Pd-based catalysts in alkaline medium can proceed via the C1-12e pathway with the help of an external light source.

Nanostructured Au have attracted much attention because of their surface plasmon resonance (SPR) property. Thus, they can be used as plasmonic promoters to assist the production of OH radicals. In addition, by virtue of well-known merits of Au in the Pd-based catalysts (such as electronic effect and CO antipoison ability<sup>[17,31,32]</sup>), nanostructured Au can be introduced into them as the cores. Moreover, nanostructured Au with a SPR absorption band in the near-infrared (NIR) region is desirable because NIR light has a lower energy which would not destroy the stability of the whole system. Bear these in mind, spiky Au nanoparticles (NPs) reported in our previous work may be one of proper candidates due to their advantages such as high electron transfer efficiency, good structural stability, and strong SPR absorption in the NIR region. Consequently, in view of the SPR effect of Au cores and electronic effect between Au and Pd for the enhancement in EOR performance, core-shell (CS) structured Au-Pd NPs with ultrathin AuPd alloy shells would be preferable.[33,34] And to reduce the ratio of photothermal effect led by the big size of spherical cores in the spiky Au NPs, spiky Au NPs with a small-sized core have to be prepared.

In this context, small-sized spiky Au NPs with six spikes and small-sized cores were firstly prepared by reducing the

dimension (length × width) of Au nanorods (NRs) as seeds from 45 × 15 nm to 21 × 7 nm, followed by epitaxy growth of Pd atoms on the as-prepared spiky Au NPs as cores for fabrication of spiky Au@AuPd NPs with ultrathin AuPd alloy shells. Then, the size, composition, and structure of the as-prepared spiky Au@AuPd NPs were investigated in detail by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), cyclic voltammetry (CV), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS), and CO stripping voltammetry. Next, the electrocatalytic performance of spiky Au@AuPd NPs toward EOR in alkaline media was investigated with the assistance of NIR light. Finally, a possible mechanism for the 12-electron oxidation of ethanol on spiky Au@AuPd NPs assisted by NIR light is proposed on the basis of the results of a series of control experiments.

## **2. Results and Discussion**

#### **2.1. Synthesis and Characterization of Spiky Au@AuPd NPs**

On the basis of our previously reported method,[35] high quality small-sized spiky Au NPs with six spikes were firstly prepared in high yield (Scheme S1, Supporting Information). It is noted that the whole dimension of spiky Au NPs with six spikes (Scheme S1b, Supporting Information) is greatly reduced because the dimensions (length × width) of Au NRs as seeds were reduced from 45 × 15 nm to 21 × 7 nm (Scheme S1a, Supporting Information). After that, spiky Au@AuPd NPs with ultrathin AuPd alloy shells (**Figure 1**; Scheme S1c, Supporting Information) were fabricated by epitaxial growth of Pd atoms on the preformed spiky Au NPs under the optimal reaction conditions, especially adjusting the pH of the reaction media to about ≈3.4.[36]

Figure 1a shows the typical TEM image of the as-prepared spiky Au@AuPd NPs, in which they show a narrow distribution in shape and size. Each spiky Au@AuPd NP consists of a spherical core and six spiky branches on average, which render them have a large specific surface area. Moreover, the average size of spherical cores, the length and the width of spiky branches are 28 ± 4, 32 ± 5, 13 ± 2 nm, respectively. Accordingly, the overall size of each spiky Au@AuPd NP is about 80 ± 10 nm. In the high magnification TEM image of one individual spiky Au@AuPd NP (Figure 1b), four spikes with different dimensions on the spherical core are obviously observed, instead of six spikes. This is because the TEM image is two-dimensional (2D) image, in which some spikes can be hidden due to the tilting angle of the spiky Au@AuPd NPs on the copper grids.[35] The different regions of different spikes on the as-prepared spiky Au@AuPd NP, which were highlighted by red boxes and indicated by red arrows (Figure 1b), were further investigated by high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) imaging (Figure 1c-e). One can clearly see that the surfaces of the as-prepared spiky Au@AuPd NPs are rather smooth after the conformal growth of Pd. And there is no obvious contrast between the AuPd alloy shells and the cores of spiky Au NP because the atomic numbers of Au and Pd are rather close and the thickness of AuPd alloy shells is rather ultrathin. Moreover, the lattice fringe

distances are about 0.236 and 0.204 nm in the center parts of spikes of spiky Au@AuPd NPs, which are well consistent with those of the {111} planes and the {100} planes of fcc gold, respectively. In addition, the lattice spacing at the edge regions of spikes is 0.235 nm (Figure 1c,e), which is located between the (111) plane of pure Au and the (111) plane of pure Pd. These results further indicate that Pd layers on the surfaces of spiky Au NP cores are so thin that they have hardly any impact the crystal plane structure of the Au cores. However, the difference between spiky Au@AuPd NPs and spiky Au NPs can be distinguished from their extinction spectra (Figure S1, Supporting Information). It is known that the extinction spectrum of Au NPs is easily impacted by the change of the dielectric constant around them.[37,38] Thus, the variation in the extinction spectra of spiky Au@AuPd NPs indicates the formation of Pd on the surfaces of spiky Au NPs. Fortunately, the intensity of SPR peak located in the NIR region (around 1010 nm) of spiky Au@AuPd NPs just slightly decreases. Thus, spiky Au@AuPd NPs still can be harnessed as SPR promoter to assist EOR.

Moreover, high-angle annular dark field-scanning transmission electron microscopy-energy dispersive spectroscopy (HAADF–STEM–EDS) images of an individual spiky Au@AuPd NP were further used to investigate its core–shell structure. It is found that the spiky Au@AuPd NP is composed of elemental Au and Pd (Figure 1f,g). And it can be clearly seen that both elemental Au and Pd exhibit blurry spiky shape and the whole area of elemental Pd is slightly larger than that of elemental Au. These results indicate the formation of the ultrathin Pd shell onto the spiky Au core. In addition, the overlapped image of elemental Au and Pd (Figure 1h) indicates the formation of the core–shell structure. Moreover, its cross-sectional compositional line profile (Figure 1i) means the possible formation of the ultrathin Pd shell on the surfaces of Au cores.

The structure and composition of the resulting spiky Au@AuPd NPs were further characterized by XRD (Figure S2, Supporting Information). The diffraction peaks of spiky Au@AuPd NPs are well matched with those of pure fcc-structured Au and are all slightly shifted about 0.2–0.8° (Figure S2b, Supporting Information), possibly due to the high percentage of Au in the spiky Au@AuPd NPs. Thus, these peaks can be attributed to the (111), (200), (220), (311), and (222) planes of face-centered cubic Au. In addition, compared with pure Au, the peak position of the Au (222) planes of the as-prepared spiky Au@AuPd NPs is shifted to 81.9° (Figure S2b, Supporting Information), which is located between the (222) planes of Au (81.7°) and the (311) planes of pure Pd (82.1°), indicating that Pd atoms are doped into the Au lattice in the spiky Au@AuPd NPs.[39]

Depending on the amount of Pd precursor, spiky Au NPs can evolve from spiky Au@AuPd NPs with AuPd shells (Pd content of 1.7%) to spiky Au@Pd NPs with Pd shells (Pd content of 3.5%) (Table S1, Supporting Information). However, the difference between spiky Au@Pd NPs and spiky Au@AuPd NPs is so tiny that they cannot be distinguished from each other (Figure 1 and Figure S3, Supporting Information). The obvious differences in the center position and the intensity of the SPR peaks (indicated by dotted lines) in their extinction spectra (Figure S1, Supporting Information) indicate the difference in the composition of their outer shells. In addition, the slight difference in their surface composition was further investigated by CV (**Figure 2**, Figure S4, Supporting Information), since CV has been widely used to characterize the surface facets of nanostructured "fingerprints" of gold.[40–42] A series of spiky Au-Pd NPs (spiky Au@AuPd NPs, spiky Au@AuPd NPs with more Pd coverage, and spiky Au@Pd NPs) were prepared, respectively. According to their surface atomic ratios obtained by the calculations (Figure S4A, Supporting Information), they are also named as spiky Au@Au65.4Pd34.6 NPs (spiky Au@AuPd NPs), spiky Au@Au9.2Pd90.8 NPs (spiky Au@AuPd NPs with a more Pd coverage), and spiky Au@ Pd NPs, respectively, for better comparison. It is clearly seen that with the increasing Pd precursor, the atomic ratio of Pd on the surfaces of spiky Au-Pd NPs is increased from 0% to 34.6%, 90.8%, and 100% while that of Au is decreased from100% to 65.4%, 9.2%, and 0% (black curve, Figure 2a and FigureS4B-a, Supporting Information). In addition, the intensity of reduction peak of Au oxides (around 0.09 V) and PdO (around −0.15 V) in the spiky Au@Au65.4Pd34.6 NPs (red curve in Figure 2b and Figure S4B-b, Supporting Information) is stronger and weaker than those (around 0.1 and −0.16 V) in spiky Au@Au9.2Pd90.8 NPs (blue curve, Figure 2c and Figure S4B-c, Supporting Information), respectively. The presence of the reduction peak of Au oxides in them indicates that spiky Au NPs in the spiky Au@Au65.4Pd34.6 NPs and spiky Au@Au9.2Pd90.8 NPs are not completely covered by Pd layer. Thus, the outermost layer of spiky Au@Au65.4Pd34.6 NPs and spiky Au@Au9.2Pd90.8 NPs are both Au-Pd alloy shells. Moreover, the reduction peak of Au oxides almost disappears while the position of the reduction peak of PdO in spiky Au@ Pd NPs is obviously shifted from −0.16 to −0.22 V (pink curve, Figure 2d and Figure S4B-d, Supporting Information). The result indicates that spiky Au NPs in the spiky Au@Pd NPs have been completely covered

All of CV curves were normalized according to the intensity of their reduction peaks of PdO.

by Pd layer. Accordingly, spiky Au NPs would evolve to spiky Au@AuPd NPs, spiky Au@AuPd NPs with more Pd coverage, and spiky Au@AuPd@Pd NPs (abbreviated as spiky Au@Pd NPs) with the increasing Pd precursor. In our case, the position (−0.16 V) of the reduction peak of PdO of spiky Au@Pd NPs is still away from that (−0.35 V) of commercial Pd/C catalysts (green curve, Figure 2e and Figure S4B-e, Supporting Information). The result also indicates the formation of ultrathin Pd layer, instead of thick Pd layer according to our previous work.[43]

XPS was used to investigate the valence states of elements and surface composition of the as-prepared spiky Au@AuPd NPs. For better comparison, spiky Au@Pd NPs were also investigated. Compared with the binding energies (BEs) of Pd 3d5/2 and Pd 3d3/2 signals of pure Pd NPs (335.0 and 340.2 eV), those of spiky Au@AuPd NPs (334.8 and 340.0 eV) are shifted by about −0.2 eV while those of spiky Au@Pd NPs (335.4 and 340.6 eV) are shifted by about +0.4 eV (**Figure 3**; **Table 1**). However, the BEs of Au 4f7/2 and Au 4f5/2 signals of spiky Au@AuPd NPs (83.6 and 87.3 eV) and spiky Au@Pd NPs (83.5 and 87.2 eV) both are shifted by about −0.2 and −0.3 eV, respectively, compared with those of spiky Au NPs (83.8 and 87.5 eV) (Figure S5, Supporting Information; Table 1). The different variations in the shift of Pd and Au in spiky Au@AuPd NPs and spiky Au@Pd NPs indicate that surface composition and structure of spiky Au@AuPd NPs and spiky Au@Pd NPs are indeed different due to the different Pd content. For instance, the simultaneously negative shift in BEs of Pd and Au signals of spiky Au@AuPd NPs means the formation of AuPd alloy shells on the spiky Au NPs.[44,45] In addition, the positive shift in BEs of Pd and the negative shift in BEs of Au signals of spiky Au@Pd NPs means the formation of core–shell structure in the spiky Au@Pd NPs.[33] Moreover, the peak-area ratios of Pd 3d5/2 to Pd 3d3/2 signals in the spiky Au@AuPd NPs (8.9 : 1) and spiky Au@Pd NPs (5.2 : 1) are far higher than that (the normal ratio of 3:2) of the pure Pd NPs, according to the peak areas of Pd 3d signals obtained in their deconvoluted XPS spectra. The peak position of Au 4d5/2 signal is located at about 334.9 eV.[46] In addition, the peak position of Pd 3d5/2 signal is located at about at 335.0 eV. Therefore, the overlapping of Au 4d5/2 signal and Pd 3d5/2 signal is highly possible, which is also demonstrated by the survey XPS spectra of spiky Au@AuPd NPs and spiky Au@Pd NPs (Figure S6, Supporting Information). Thus, the increase in the intensities of the Pd 3d5/2 signals in spiky Au@AuPd NPs and spiky Au@Pd NPs results from the contribution of the Au 4d5/2 signals.[47] In addition, the larger contribution of the Au 4d5/2 signals of spiky Au cores to Pd 3d5/2 signals of outermost Pd layer in the spiky Au@AuPd NPs further indicates the formation of ultrathin AuPd shells on the surfaces of spiky Au NPs. Accordingly, the strong interaction between Pd and Au would also impact absorption and desorption ability of Pd located at outermost surfaces. The negative shift in BEs of Pd 3d signal of spiky Au@AuPd NPs would improve the interaction between the adsorbate states and the metal d states.[48,49] In our case, the adsorption capacity of intermediates would be reduced, which render them to may have excellent catalytic performance.

CO stripping voltammogram was used to further investigate the differences among spiky Au NPs, spiky Au@AuPd NPs,

spiky Au@Pd NPs and commercial Pd/C catalysts (**Figure 4**; Figure S7, Supporting Information). As expected, there is no obvious sharp peak observed in the CO stripping curve of spiky Au NPs (Figure 4a), while one typically sharp peak around 0.73 V (versus Ag/AgCl) is observed in the CO stripping curve of commercial Pd/C catalysts (Figure 4b). Compared with spiky Au NPs and commercial Pd/C catalysts, one rather broad peak ranging from 0.85 to 1.1 V (versus Ag/AgCl) is observed in CO-stripping curve of spiky Au@AuPd NPs, which is composed of one main peak center at about 0.96 V and one weak shoulder peak center at about 0.88 V (Figure 4c), indicating the presence of the strong electronic interaction between Pd and

The BEs of Pd 3d and Au 4f signals of pure Pd NPs and spiky Au NPs are also investigated for comparison.

Au.[50] The result also indicates that the thickness of Pd layer on the cores of spiky Au@AuPd NPs is rather ultrathin. Moreover, the absence of sharp peaks further confirms that the outermost layer of spiky Au@AuPd NPs is indeed an AuPd alloy shell. In contrast, in the CO-stripping curves of spiky Au@Pd NPs (Figure 4d), one rather broad peak ranging from 0.7 to 1.1 V (versus Ag/AgCl) is also observed. However, this peak is composed of one main sharp peak center at about 0.78 V and one shoulder peak center at about 0.92 V. The presence of sharp peaks further confirms the outermost layer of spiky Au@Pd NPs is pure Pd layer, instead of AuPd alloy shells. In addition, the thickness of Pd layer on the cores of spiky Au@Pd NPs is thicker than that of spiky Au@AuPd NPs. Last but not the least, the obvious difference in Hupd region (hydrogen adsorption-desorption region) of spiky Au@AuPd NPs, spiky Au@Pd NPs and commercial Pd/C catalysts (Figure S7, Supporting Information) indicates that Pd atoms on the surfaces of spiky Au@AuPd NP are highly dispersed by Au atoms because the occurrence of Hupd region at least requires Pd dimers.[51,52]

#### **2.2. Electrochemical Activity of Spiky Au@AuPd NPs**

According to CVs measured in the KOH solution (**Figure 5**A), one typical reduction peak in spiky Au@AuPd NPs is visible at around −0.2 V, derived from the transformation of PdO into Pd. Compared with the spiky Au@AuPd NPs, spiky Au@Pd NPs exhibit two cathodic peaks centered at about −0.2 and −0.3 V, which are attributed to reduction peaks of PdO, and dehydrated PdO or palladium hydroxide, respectively.[53] The electrochemically active surface areas (ECSAs) of spiky Au@AuPd NPs, spiky Au@Pd NPs and commercial Pd/C catalysts were calculated.[54,55] The ECSA value of the as-prepared spiky Au@AuPd NPs is 133.8 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> , which is 1.25 and 4.25 times higher than that of spiky Au@Pd NPs (106.9 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> ) and commercial Pd/C catalysts (31.5 m2 g<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> ), respectively. The result indicates that the formation of thinner AuPd shells indeed greatly improves the Pd utilization. And spiky Au@AuPd NPs are expected to exhibit better EOR performance due to the larger ECSA value.[56] In addition, a NIR laser with a wavelength of 1064 nm was employed as the light source to assist EOR catalyzed by spiky Au@AuPd NPs, according to the position of the SPR peak in the NIR region of spiky Au@AuPd NPs. Accordingly, the electrocatalytic performance of spiky Au@AuPd NPs, spiky Au@Pd NPs, and commercial Pd/C catalysts toward EOR were investigated in 0.5 m KOH containing 0.5 m ethanol in the absence and presence of the NIR light (Figure 5B,C), and the data were summarized in **Table 2**.

In the absence of NIR light (Figure 5B), the mass-normalized current density (used as mass activity for simplicity in later parts) of spiky Au@AuPd NPs is 13.7 A mgPd<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> , which is 1.7 times and 65 times higher than that of spiky Au@Pd NPs (7.8 A mgPd<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> ) and commercial Pd/C catalysts (0.21 A mgPd<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> ), respectively. Compared with commercial Pd/C catalysts, the introduction of spiky Au NPs as cores indeed can greatly improve the electrocatalytic activity of spiky Au@AuPd NPs and spiky Au@Pd NPs due to the electronic effect between Au and Pd.[57,58] Moreover, the mass activity of spiky Au@AuPd NPs is higher than that of spiky Au@Pd NPs because of the following reasons: i) It is discussed above that the electronic effect between Au and Pd in the spiky Au@AuPd NPs is stronger than that in spiky Au@Pd NPs; and ii) the higher Pd utilization led by the thinner Pd shells in spiky Au@AuPd NPs.

It has been discussed above that there is obvious difference in the outermost surfaces between spiky Au@AuPd NPs and spiky Au@Pd NPs. Thus, spiky Au@AuPd NPs and spiky Au@Pd NPs can be regarded as heterostructured and homogeneous structured SPR promoter due to the difference in surface coverage by Pd atoms, which can lead to surface charge heterogeneity and surface charge homogeneity, respectively, thus leading to the different catalytic ability. The oxidation potentials of commercial Pd/C catalysts and spiky Au@Pd NPs toward EOR are the nearly same due to full coverage of Pd atoms while that of spiky Au@AuPd NPs is obviously positively shifted due to partial coverage of Pd atoms, which are −0.194, −0.197, and −0.152 V, respectively. In addition, the results also indicate that the selectivity of C1-12e pathway in the whole oxidation pathway of spiky Au@AuPd NPs toward EOR may be improved, which also may be responsible for the enhancement in their mass activity.

Cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves (A–C) of the GCEs modified by commercial Pd/C catalysts (a), spiky Au@AuPd nanoparticles (NPs) (b), and spiky Au@Pd NPs (c) measured in 0.5 M KOH solutions in the absence (A) and presence of ethanol (B,C), and their corresponding CVs measured in 0.5 M KOH solutions containing ethanol without (B) and with (C) the assistance of near-infrared (NIR) irradiation, histograms (D,E) of their mass and specific activities, and their corresponding Tafel plots (F) without (a–c) and with (a1–c1) NIR irradiation. For better comparison, the values of commercial Pd/C catalysts are expanded by 10 times in the (B–E).

In contrast, in the presence of the NIR light with a power density of 120 mW cm<sup>-2</sup> (Figure 5C), the mass activity of commercial Pd/C catalysts under NIR light irradiation (defined as NIR-commercial Pd/C catalysts) just increased from 0.21 to  $0.25 \text{ A mg}_{Pd}^{-1}$  (Figure 5D). The increase of about 19.0% in the mass activity (Figure S8, Table S2, Supporting Information) can be mainly attributed to the heat of direct absorption from the NIR light (called as heat effect), since the heat from the conversion of light energy by the SPR effect of Pd and carbon black is rather weak. In addition, the increase in the mass activity of the NIR-mixture of commercial Pd/C catalysts and spiky Au NPs is 58.3% (Figure S9, Table S2, Supporting Information). Accordingly, the contribution of plasmon-induced thermal effect (called as photothermal effect) of spiky Au cores to the total mass activity is about 39.3%, since the electronic interaction between Au of spiky Au NPs and Pd of commercial Pd/C catalysts in the NIR-mixture of commercial Pd/C catalysts and spiky Au NPs is rather weak and can be negligible. (Figure S10, Supporting Information).

Moreover, the mass activity of NIR-spiky Au@Pd NPs increased from 8.0 to15.8 A mg<sub>Pd</sub><sup>-1</sup> (Figure 5D). The increase of about 97.5% in the mass activity can be attributed to the heat effect, photothermal effect, and photoelectric effect of spiky

Au cores under the irradiation of the NIR light, [59,60] which are determined to be about 19.0%, 39.3%, and 39.2%, respectively (Figure S11, Table S2, Supporting Information). Note that the contribution of photoelectric effect to the total the mass activity of NIR-spiky Au@Pd NPs toward EOR is not remarkable. This is possibly because the thicker Pd shell on spiky Au NPs weakens their SPR effect.

More significantly, the mass activity of NIR-spiky Au@AuPd NPs is as high as up to 33.2 A mg<sub>Pd</sub><sup>-1</sup>(Figure 5D), which is 2.4, 2.1, and 133 times higher than that of spiky Au@AuPd NPs (13.7 A mg<sub>Pd</sub><sup>-1</sup>) (red curve in Figure 5B), NIR-spiky Au@Pd NPs  $(15.8 \text{Amg}_{Pd}^{-1})$ , and NIR-commercial Pd/C catalysts  $(0.25 \text{Amg}_{Pd}^{-1})$ , respectively. In addition, the mass activity of NIR-spiky Au@AuPd NPs is improved to142.2%, which can be attributed to heat effect (19.0%), photothermal effect (39.3%), and photoelectric effect (83.9%) induced by SPR effect of spiky Au cores under the NIR irradiation, respectively (Figure S12, Table S2, Supporting Information). Moreover, as shown in Figure 5E, NIR-spiky Au@AuPd NPs show the highest specific activity (24.8 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>), which are better than those of spiky Au@AuPd NPs without the assistance of NIR irradiation (10.2 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>), spiky Au@Pd NPs with and without the assistance of NIR irradiation (14.8 and 7.5 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>), and commercial Pd/C catalysts

with and without the assistance of NIR irradiation (0.66 and 0.79 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>). Furthermore, the performance of NIR-spiky Au@AuPd NPs toward EOR is higher than that reported in literature so far (Table S3, Supporting Information).

Meanwhile, NIR-spiky Au@AuPd NPs exhibit the most negative onset potential (inset of Figure 5C), indicating a better oxidizing ability and the decreased activation barrier for EOR.[61] In addition, the oxidation potentials of NIR-commercial Pd/C catalysts, NIR-spiky Au@Pd NPs, and NIR-spiky Au@AuPd NPs toward EOR are -0.191, -0.145, and -0.072 V, which are positively shifted about 3, 49, and 122 mV, compared with that of commercial Pd/C catalysts. The variation in their oxidation potentials toward EOR also mean that the selectivity of C1-12e pathway in the whole oxidation pathway is improved. And the largest positive shift of 122 mV in the oxidation potential of NIR-spiky Au@AuPd NPs toward EOR implies that C1-12e pathway may dominate. Moreover, the stability of NIR-spiky Au@AuPd NPs toward EOR is much better than that of commercial Pd/C catalysts with and without NIR light (Figure S13, Supporting Information).

Their Tafel slopes at low potential range were measured to reveal their kinetic process toward EOR (Figure 5F). The Tafel slope of commercial Pd/C catalysts is 142.6 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>, which is rather higher than that of spiky Au@Pd NPs (113.6 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>) and spiky Au@AuPd NPs (110.9 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>) (a-c in Figure 5F). Since the main pathway of commercial Pd/C catalysts toward EOR is C2-4e pathway, the selectivity of C1-12e pathway in the whole pathway of spiky Au@Pd NPs and spiky Au@AuPd NPs toward EOR are improved. In contrast, the Tafel slopes of NIR-commercial Pd/C catalysts, NIR-spiky Au@Pd NPs, and NIR-spiky Au@AuPd NPs toward EOR (a1-c1 in Figure 5F) are all smaller than those in the absence of NIR irradiation (a-c in Figure 5F). For instance, their Tafel slopes are changed from 142.6 to 125.3 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>, from 113.6 to 93.7 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>, and from 110.9 to 84.2 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. These results indicate that the charge and mass transfer kinetic process of these catalysts toward EOR become faster after the introduction of NIR light, compared with that of commercial Pd/C catalysts in the absence of NIR irradiation. Accordingly, the selectivity of C1-12e pathway in the whole pathway toward EOR should be improved. In view of the large difference in the Tafel slopes between commercial Pd/C catalysts toward EOR (142.6 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>) and NIR-spiky Au@AuPd NPs toward EOR (84.2 mV  $dec^{-1}$ ), the ratelimiting step during EOR catalyzed by NIR-spiky Au@AuPd

NPs should be totally different.<sup>[62]</sup> That is, the C1-12e pathway may dominate during EOR catalyzed by NIR-spiky Au@AuPd NPs.

The typical character of C1-12e pathway during EOR is the occurrence of C-C bond cleavage, which would produce quite a lot of CO2. Since EOR in our case is conducted in alkaline media, the generated CO2 should be dissolved in the electrolyte solution (CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup> ions). Thus, the presence of CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup> ions in the electrolyte solution may assist to roughly tell the occurrence of C1-12e pathway during EOR. Accordingly, four batches of transparent Ca(OH)2 solutions of the same volume were added into four pieces of electrolyte solutions (Figure 6A) after EOR catalyzed by commercial Pd/C catalysts (a in Figure 6A), the mixture of commercial Pd/C catalysts and spiky Au NPs (b in Figure 6A), spiky Au@AuPd NPs (c in Figure 6A), and NIR-spiky Au@AuPd NPs (d in Figure 6A), respectively. One can clearly see that the turbidity degree of the corrsponding solutions gradually increases. Since the turbidity degree of the solutions are induced by the formation of CaCO<sub>3</sub> precipitates led by the reaction between Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup> ions (dissolved CO<sub>2</sub> in the electrolyte solution), the volume of production of CO2 during EOR catalyzed by NIR-spiky Au@AuPd NPs is the highest among them; spiky Au@AuPd NPs comes second; there is hardly any change in the solutions for the mixture of commercial Pd/C catalysts and spiky Au NPs, and commercial Pd/C catalysts. The results indicate that the degree of cleavage of C-C bonds in EOR catalyzed by NIR-spiky Au@AuPd NPs is rather high, combined with the results mentioned above (including their highest mass activity, the largest positive shift in the oxidation potential, and the smallest Tafel slope) at the same time. Thus, it is highly possible that C1-12e pathway dominates during EOR catalyzed by NIR-spiky Au@AuPd NPs.

As discussed above, the catalytic performance of spiky Au@AuPd NPs toward EOR is highly dependent on NIR irradiation (including heat effect, photothermal effect, and photoelectric effect). Among them, photoelectric effect is related to the generation of charge carriers via the SPR effect<sup>[63,64]</sup> led by the cores of spiky Au NPs in spiky Au@AuPd NPs in our case, which can modulate the nature and kinetics of electrochemical reactions occurring at the interface. [65] Thus, the variation in the power density of the NIR light should impact the selectivity of the oxidation pathway of EOR and the corresponding catalytic performance. As expected, when the power density of the NIR light increases from 0 to 40, 80, and 120 mW cm<sup>-2</sup>, the oxidation potentials of spiky Au@AuPd NPs toward EOR (Figure 6B) gradually shifts from -0.16 to -0.13, -0.10, and -0.08 V, respectively. These results suggest that the main oxidation pathway of EOR gradually varies from a C2-4e to C1-12e pathway. Accordingly, their mass activity increase from 13.4 to 19.7, 26.1, and 32.3 A mg<sub>Pd</sub><sup>-1</sup>. In addition, their mass activity is also linearly dependent on the power density of the NIR light, indicating that the catalytic performance of NIR-spiky Au@AuPd NPs toward EOR is indeed closely associated with photoelectric effect, which can assist the breaking of the C-C bonds by the charge transfer promoted by SPR effect of the cores of spiky Au NPs.<sup>[66]</sup>

It is known that in the traditional C2-4e pathway of EOR catalyzed by commercial Pd/C catalysts, the limiting step is the desorption of the intermediates on the surfaces of catalyst, [67] which

B) cyclic voltammetry (CVs) of NIR-spiky Au@AuPd NPs toward EOR under various power density; C,D) plots between mass activity versus the scan rate (*V*) for commercial Pd/C catalysts (C) and versus square root of the scan rate (*V*1/2) for NIR-spiky Au@AuPd NPs (D).

is a surface-controlled reaction. Since the scan rate can impact the kinetics and performance of EOR, CV curves of commercial Pd/C catalysts and NIR-spiky Au@AuPd NPs toward EOR were further investigate in 0.5 m KOH solutions containing 0.5 m ethanol at different scan rates (Figure S14, Supporting Information). It is found that their mass activities both increase with the scan rate increasing. Moreover, their mass activities were further plotted versus the scan rate (*V*) for commercial Pd/C catalysts (Figure 6C) and the square root of the scan rate (*V*1/2) for NIR-spiky Au@AuPd NPs (Figure 6D). One can clearly see the good linear relationship between the mass activity and *V* for commercial Pd/C catalysts, and the mass activity and *V*1/2 for NIR-spiky Au@AuPd NPs. The results indicate that EOR catalyzed by commercial Pd/C catalysts is indeed a surfacecontrolled reaction while that by NIR-spiky Au@AuPd NPs is a diffusion-controlled reaction.[68–71] Therefore, EOR catalyzed by NIR-spiky Au@AuPd NPs may undergo an C1-12e pathway, different from C2-4e pathway catalyzed by commercial Pd/C catalysts. In brief, the breaking of C–C bonds during EOR catalyzed by NIR-spiky Au@AuPd NPs is highly possible. And the production of OH radicals may play the key role during the EOR because only OH radicals can effectively break C–C bonds in our case, when everything has been considered. Consequently, the 3,3″,5,5″- tetramethylbenzidine (TMB), one common rad-

ical scavenger, is used to evaluate the production of OH radicals in the solution.

As expected, the mass activity of NIR-spiky Au@AuPd NPs toward EOR indeed decreases after the addition of TMB into the electrolyte solution (**Figure 7**a). Since TMB can capture the OH radicals produced in the electrolyte solution, the decrease in the mass activity is due to the reduction of OH radicals produced by SPR effect of NIR-spiky Au@AuPd NPs, thus reducing the probability of C–C bond cleavage during the EOR.

Since there is much difference in the pathway and kinetics of EOR between NIR-commercial Pd/C catalysts and NIR-spiky Au@AuPd NPs, their electrocatalytic behavior were investigated in detail for comparison (Figures S15–19, Supporting Information). As expected, the variation in the plots of their mass activity versus *C*Ethanol or versus *C*KOH is indeed different in the same range of ethanol (Figure 7b,c) and KOH concentration (Figure 7d,e). For instance, at the fixed KOH concentration (Figure 7b,c), the mass activity of NIR-commercial Pd/C catalysts toward EOR firstly linearly increases with ethanol concentration in the range from 0.15 to 0.75 m and then slowly increases with the ethanol concentration in the range from 0.75 to 1.25 m. However, the mass activity of NIR-spiky Au@AuPd NPs always linearly increases with ethanol concentration in the range from 0.15 to 1.25 m. The appearance of

the inflection point (highlighted by a red circle) in the plot of NIR-commercial Pd/C catalysts suggests that there is still the adsorption balance between ethanol and OH− ions during the EOR catalyzed by NIR-commercial Pd/C catalysts in the current range of *C*Ethanol, which is in agreement with those reported in literature.[29,72,73] However, when the *C*Ethanol (or *C*KOH) is further bigger than that at the inflection point, the mass activity of commercial Pd/C catalysts toward EOR is decreased[29,73] while that of NIR-commercial Pd/C catalysts toward EOR is slowly increased (Figure 7b,d). The slight difference in the variation trend in the plots of their mass activity versus *C*Ethanol (or CKOH) is due to the fact that the introduction of NIR light may slight vary the reaction kinetics of EOR catalyzed commercial Pd/C catalysts. In current case, it is possible that heat effect led by NIR light may accelerate the desorption of intermediates and products, which in turn accelerate the adsorption and desorption of ethanol and OH− ions on active sites. Accordingly, the conversion rate of ethanol molecules into products would be more rapid than that in the absence of NIR light. This is also why the mass activity of NIR-commercial Pd/C catalysts in the presence of NIR light can be improved (Table 2).

Moreover, the concentration of ethanol at the inflection point in the plot of NIR-commercial Pd/C catalysts (Figure 7b) is 0.75 m, which is rather lower than that (1.25 m) of NIR-spiky Au@AuPd NPs (Figure S16, Supporting Information). Accordingly, the delay in the appearance of the inflection points for them further confirm that reaction kinetics of EOR catalyzed by NIR-spiky Au@AuPd NPs (diffusion-controlled reaction) may be different from that catalyzed by NIR-commercial Pd/C catalysts.

It is known that the further increase in the concentration of ethanol or OH− ions would reduce the mass activity of EOR in general because the adsorption sites of OH− ions or ethanol molecules on the surfaces of catalysts are not sufficient and occupied by the increasing ethanol molecules or OH− ions (surface-controlled reaction). Obviously, when the concentration of ethanol is bigger than 0.75 but lower than 1.25 m (the inflection point), the variation in the mass activity toward EOR of NIR-spiky Au@AuPd NPs is different from that of NIRcommercial Pd/C catalysts. Therefore, these results indicate that the conversion rate of ethanol molecules into products during EOR catalyzed by NIR-spiky Au@AuPd NPs toward EOR is faster than that by NIR-commercial Pd/C catalysts. However, the decrease in the amount of OHads species have to be compensated by the rapid consumption and adsorption of OHads species (diffusion-controlled reaction). In our case, it is highly possible that the adsorbed OHads species on spiky

Au@AuPd NPs are rapidly transformed into OH radicals under NIR irradiation, which are further consumed rapidly by oxidation of intermediates into products. Accordingly, some active sites on spiky Au@AuPd NPs can be rapidly released, which can meet the rapid adsorption of OHads species (evolution from surface controlled to diffusion-controlled reaction). However, when the concentration of ethanol is bigger than 1.25 m (the inflection point), most of active sites would be occupied by the increasing ethanol molecules. Under this situation, the released active sites by the rapid consumption of OHads species also cannot make up the decrease in the amount of OHads species due to the predominant occupy of ethanol molecules. Accordingly, their mass activity starts to decrease (Figure S16, Supporting Information).

Likewise, at the fixed ethanol concentration (0.5 m), the mass activity of NIR-commercial Pd/C catalysts toward EOR firstly linearly increases with KOH concentration in the range from 0.25 to 1.0 m and then slowly increases with the KOH concentration in the range from 1.0 to 1.5 m (Figure 7d). In contrast, the mass activity of NIR-spiky Au@AuPd NPs still always linearly increases with KOH concentration in the range from 0.25 to 1.5 m (Figure 7e). Obviously, the concentration of KOH at the inflection point in the plot of NIR-commercial Pd/C catalysts (Figure 7d) is 1.0 m, which is also rather lower than that (1.5 m) at the inflection point in the plot of NIR-spiky Au@AuPd NPs (Figure S18, Supporting Information). Similarly, when the concentration of KOH is bigger than 1.0 m but lower than 1.5 m (the inflection point), the variation in the mass activity toward EOR of NIR-spiky Au@AuPd NPs is also different from that of NIR-commercial Pd/C catalysts. Therefore, these results indicate that more OHads species can contribute to the rapid conversion of ethanol into products during EOR catalyzed by NIR-spiky Au@AuPd NPs. However, the decrease in the amount of adsorption sites of ethanol also have to be compensated. As mentioned above, when some active sites on spiky Au@AuPd NPs are rapidly released due to the rapid consumption of OHads species, which may make up for the decrease in the amount of adsorption sites of ethanol molecules. Similarly, when the concentration of KOH is bigger than 1.5 m (the inflection point), OHads species would predominantly occupy most of active sites. Under this situation, the decrease in the amount of adsorption sites of ethanol molecules cannot be compensated by the released active sites from rapid consumption of OHads species. Accordingly, their mass activity starts to decrease when the concentration of KOH is higher than 1.5 m (Figure S18, Supporting Information).

Briefly, the introduction of NIR light into EOR catalyzed spiky Au@AuPd NPs can assist the formation of OH radical, which can result in the change in reaction pathway of EOR (from C1-12e to C2-4e pathway) and reaction kinetics (from surface controlled to diffusion-controlled). In addition, the absorption kinetics of both ethanol and OH− ions are simultaneously improved. Consequently, at the optimal concentrations of ethanol (1.25 m) and OH− ions (1.50 m), the mass activity of NIR-spiky Au@AuPd NPs can be as high as 118.3 A mgPd<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> (Figure 7f and Figure S19, Supporting Information), which is higher than those reported in literature thus far, to the best of our knowledge.

#### **2.3. Possible Mechanisms of NIR-Spiky Au@AuPd NPs Toward EOR**

In general, CS spiky Au@Pd NPs with an intact Pd shell are considered to exhibit charge homogeneity due to their uniform outer Pd shell (Scheme S2, Supporting Information), and the dense Pd shell layer would largely shield the SPR effect of Au. Accordingly, the recombination of hot electrons and holes in spiky Au@Pd NPs led by the SPR effect in the presence of NIR would also rapidly occur,[74,75] which is just slightly slow than that of pure Au NPs. Compared with spiky Au@Pd NPs, the outermost layer of spiky Au@AuPd NPs is that Pd atoms are highly dispersed in the Au atomic layer. Thus, SPR effect of spiky Au@AuPd NPs can promote the electron transfer from Pd to Au on such heterostructured AuPd surfaces due to the electronegativity difference between Au and Pd,[76] thus realizing surface charge heterogeneity.[77,78] Therefore, the recombination of hot electrons and holes on the surface of spiky Au@AuPd NPs will be slower than that on the spiky Au@Pd NPs and the spiky Au NPs. Accordingly, the recombination of hot electrons and holes on their surfaces would be slower than that on spiky Au@Pd NPs and spiky Au NPs.

To investigate surface charge heterogeneity of spiky Au@AuPd NP in the presence of NIR irradiation, the interfacial interaction between spiky Au NPs and Pd was explored by singleparticle photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. For better comparison, the PL intensities of 10 individual NPs (including spiky Au NPs and spiky Au@AuPd NPs) were randomly monitored (**Figure 8**a). Each spiky Au NP exhibits a distinct PL feature, confirming its strong capability to light absorption. Remarkably, the PL intensity of each spiky Au@AuPd NPs is drastically reduced, compared with that of each spiky Au NP,

**Figure 8.** a) Photoluminescence (PL) intensity of individual spiky Au nanoparticles (NPs) and spiky Au@AuPd NPs randomly monitored. b) The comparison of PL intensity of single spiky Au NPs and spiky Au@AuPd NPs. c) Schematic representation of the conversion of OHads species into OH radicals on spiky Au@AuPd NP in the presence of nearinfrared (NIR) irradiation.

indicating that the PL property of spiky Au NPs is quenched by Pd atoms. Figure 8b provides a visualized comparison for two representative NPs while their corresponding PL images are presented in Figure S20 (Supporting Information). The PL intensity of spiky Au@AuPd NPs is significantly lower than that of spiky Au NPs. This is because when some Pd atoms are deposited onto the surfaces of spiky Au NPs, electron transfer between Au and Pd would occur, which can lead to the formation of charge separation state. This process would compete with their SPR emission, and result in the damping in their PL. In contrast, PL intensities of spiky Au@Pd NPs with a full Pd coverage are too low to be detected. Consequently, these results reveal that electron transfer between Au and Pd of spiky Au@AuPd NPs is more effective than that of spiky Au@Pd NPs. In addition, spiky Au@AuPd NPs exhibit surface charge heterogeneity, and thus improves the catalytic activity[77,79,80] while spiky Au@Pd NPs indeed exhibit charge homogeneity.

Bear these in mind, the possible mechanism of EOR catalyzed by NIR-spiky Au@AuPd NPs was proposed (Figure 8c) on the basis of our results mentioned above. When the NIR light is introduced, the separation of hot electrons and holes would occur the surfaces of spiky Au@AuPd NPs. Then, holes would appear on the surfaces of active Pd sites.[81] Subsequently, the produced holes would oxidize the OHads species (instead of OH− ions) adsorbed on the surfaces of Pd atoms into OH radicals, followed by the cleavage of the C–C bond of neighboring ethanol molecules absorbed on the surfaces of Pd atoms by reacting with OH radicals because of its extremely strong oxidative ability.[82,83] Moreover, partial electrons transferring from Pd to Au atoms and continuous consumption of holes can in turn effectively inhibit the recombination of hot electrons and holes. Therefore, the electrocatalytic performance of NIR-spiky Au@AuPd NPs-NIR toward EOR is greatly improved. Briefly, the unique heterogeneous structure and SPR effect of spiky Au@AuPd NPs result in their enhanced electrocatalytic performance of EOR when the NIR light is introduced. And our preliminary results provide one humble step to cleave C–C bonds in organic molecules.

## **3. Conclusions**

In summary, the electrocatalytic performance of spiky Au@AuPd NPs with ultrathin AuPd alloy shells toward EOR are greatly improved by introducing the NIR light with a wavelength of 1064 nm, which can result in the transformation of the EOR pathway from C2-4e to C1-12e pathway. Accordingly, their mass activity can be up to 33.2 A mgpd<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> in the 0.5 m KOH solution containing 0.5 m ethanol, which is about 158 times higher than that of commercial Pd/C catalysts (0.21 A mgpd<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> ) and is better than those of the state-of-the-art Pd-based catalysts reported in the literature thus far, to the best of our knowledge. Moreover, their highest mass activity can be further improved to 118.3 A mgpd<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> in the 1.5 m KOH solution containing 1.25 m ethanol. Their superior electrocatalytic performance toward EOR under NIR light is attributed to the following reasons: 1) The cores of spiky Au NPs enable them act as good plasmonic promoters in the NIR range; 2) the presence of ultrathin AuPd alloy shells can delay the recombination of hot electrons and holes led by SPR effect due to charge heterogeneity and partial electrons transferring from Pd and Au atoms; 3) the produced holes can result in the formation of OH radicals, which then can directly break the C–C bond of neighboring ethanol molecules on the surfaces of Pd atoms. Our preliminary results may provide one humble step to break C–C bonds in other organic molecules with OH radicals by constructing Au-based NPs as plasmonic promoters for the production of OH radicals from the active OHads species.

## **4. Experimental Section**

*Synthesis of Spiky Au NPs with Core Size of 28* ± *4 nm and Spikes of 32* ± *5 nm*: Spiky Au NPs with small dimensions was synthesized according to the previous procedure with modifications. Firstly, GSHfunctionalized Au21<sup>×</sup><sup>7</sup> NRs were obtained by mixing the as-prepared Au21×<sup>7</sup> NRs (1 mL) with one glutathione (GSH) solution (0.01 m, 500 µL) for 2 h under stirring. Next, a growth solution was prepared by consecutive addition of CTAC solution (0.04 m, 5 mL), HAuCl4 solution (0.025 m, 50 µL), and AgNO3 solution (0.001 m, 30 µL) into one 10 mL conical flask under stirring. Then, an aqueous solution of ascorbic acid (AA) (0.10 m, 80 µL) was added into the flask, which resulted in an immediate color change in the mixture solution from light yellow to colorless. Next, the resulting GSH-functionalized Au21<sup>×</sup><sup>7</sup> NRs (60 µL) was quickly injected into the conical flask under vigorous stirring. After about further stirring of 5 min, the flask was transferred to a water bath at 28 °C and left undisturbed 5 h, ensuring the formation of high quality spiky Au NPs. Eventually, the spiky Au NPs were collected and washed with Milli-Q water with the aid of centrifugation (at 7000 rcf for 8 min). The resulting spiky Au NPs were concentrated two times and dispersed in the CTAC solution (50 × 10−<sup>3</sup> m, 2 mL) for further use.

*Synthesis of Spiky Au@AuPd NPs*: The synthetic procedure for spiky Au@AuPd NPs with ultrathin AuPd shells by epitaxial growth of Pd atoms onto the as-prepared spiky Au NPs as cores was as follows. The aqueous solutions of HCl (1 m, 10 µL), Na2PdCl4 (1 × 10−<sup>3</sup> m, 40 µL), and AA (0.1 m, 80 µL) were consecutively added to the aqueous dispersions of the as-prepared spiky Au NPs (2 mL) under stirring, followed by incubation of 3 h at room temperature. Finally, spiky Au@AuPd NPs were obtained with the aid of centrifugation (at 7000 rcf for 8 min).

*Testing for the Amount of CO*2 *Produced After EOR*: The aqueous solution of Ca(OH)2 was firstly prepared. After standing of about 10 h, the supernatant was collected and sealed for storage. Then, clear Ca(OH)2 solutions with the same volume (500 µL) were added to the electrolyte solutions after the EOR catalyzed by commercial Pd/C catalysts, mixture of spiky Au NPs and commercial Pd/C catalysts, spiky Au@AuPd NPs, and spiky Au@AuPd NPs in the presence of NIR irradiation, respectively.

*Verification of the Generation of OH Radicals*: The generation of OH radicals during the spiky Au@AuPd NPs under NIR irradiation was verified by introducing TMB into the electrolyte since TMB is one type of radical scavengers. Firstly, the ethanol solution of TMB (0.01 m) was prepared by dissolving TMB powder in ethanol. And 60 µL of the resulting ethanol solution of TMB (0.01 m) was added into 0.5 m KOH solution containing 0.5 m ethanol. Eventually, the EOR performance of spiky Au@AuPd NPs in the presence NIR irradiation were measured in the resulting electrolyte (0.5 m KOH solution containing 0.5 m ethanol) with TMB.

Abstract: The future of fuel cells technology will require porous or very organized multicomponent catalytic layers that can be prepared by thin film growth methods. Reducing the cost of these energy systems will also necessitate that the catalytic layers to be binderless and contain low amount of the noble catalyst at least until more efficient non-noble catalysts are discovered. To address these requirements, mono layered SnO2, Pt and Rh, bi-layered Pt/SnO2 and Rh/Pt and novel tri-layered Rh (various thicknesses)/Pt/SnO<sub>2</sub> catalysts supported on carbon paper have been synthesized at room temperature via a plasma technique that is the pulsed laser deposition. The catalysts are evaluated for their catalytic performance for the ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR), durability and tolerance to CO-poisoning. All the Rh/Pt/SnO2 catalysts produce high CO-tolerance, high EOR catalytic activity and durability as compared to pure Pt. The possible mechanism by which SnO2 and Rh atoms facilitate the observed enhanced performance is also considered herein, and we conclude an optimal  $Rh/Pt/SnO_2$ structure having a 10 nm thickness of Rh layer offers a promising anode catalyst for direct ethanol fuel cells. Notably, the onset potential for CO oxidation is extraordinarily 430 mV more negative than on Pt, and the specific mass activity for ethanol oxidation and durability were respectively 2.25 and 4.2 times higher than on Pt.

# 1. Introduction

S. Ramachandran and U. Stimming published an interesting analysis of low carbon alternatives such as electricity, hydrogen and biofuels in the transport sector for reducing the green house gas emissions and providing a sustainable future. <sup>[1]</sup> The analysis reports that the Food and Agricultural Organisation has estimated that one third of the edible part of the food is wasted globally which amounts to 1.3 billion tons per year. A total amount of 106.2 billion litres per year of bio-ethanol could be produced from it. <sup>[1]</sup> Within the low carbon alternatives, ethanol is appealing as a green fuel with high theoretical energy density

(8.0 kW h kg<sup>-1</sup>) and can be produced from biomass such as algae, food waste, agricultural waste and wood waste (including wood chips) and by that it will not compete with the food chain. This could make direct ethanol fuel cells (DEFCs) advantageous low GHG power sources. Indeed, a DEFC converts the chemical energy from ethanol directly into electrical energy and by that eliminating the requirement of a separate intermediate reformation step. In addition to having high theoretical energy density, the high volumetric energy density of ethanol renders the DEFC system compact and simple.<sup>[2]</sup>

Yet, the commercialization of DEFCs is mainly hindered by the incomplete oxidation of ethanol to CO2 due to the low actual anode catalyst activities. Platinum, which is the most, commonly used catalyst for the application of fuel cells reactions does not permit the complete oxidation of ethanol to CO2 but rather catalyzes the ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) to generate acetic acid or acetaldehyde. [3] The key challenge in developing catalysts for EOR is to find systems that facilitate several processes, which are dehydrogenation, C-C bond cleavage and oxidation of adsorbed CO that poisons the electrode surface. [4-5] Furthermore, water activation at low electrode potentials is essential since it generates oxygen-containing species such as OH for the subsequent oxidation of adsorbed CO on the Pt surface. [6-8] A large number of studies have indicated that PtSn system as the most effective catalyst for EOR in acidic media. [9] <sup>10]</sup> Nevertheless, in situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (in situ FTIRS) and differential electrochemical mass spectroscopy (DEMS) investigations revealed that PtSn catalysts did not completely oxidized ethanol into CO2, rather acetaldehyde and acetic acid were the dominant products during the EOR.[11] The use of metal oxides (MnO2, WO3, MoO3, and CeO<sub>2</sub>) as supports or as promoters of Pt electrocatalyst has been shown to enhance EOR. [12-22] Among all metal oxides studied, SnO2 has prevailed the literature in this area, which demonstrated the best catalytic contribution to platinum. [22-27] In light of this literature, it is generally agreed that metal oxide

species stabilize Pt nanoparticle dispersions, and they are prone to adsorption of higher number of OH adsorbed species at lower potentials (bifunctional effect), a mechanism that facilitates the CO electrooxidation process during the EOR. Rhodium is until now the only metal believed to be capable in accomplishing a C–C bond cleavage at low temperatures during the EOR.<sup>[28-35]</sup>

There have been few attempts to synthesize the ternary Pt-Rh-SnO<sub>2</sub> using different methods. Kowal et al. synthesized an active PtRhSnO<sub>2</sub>/C ethanol electrocatalysts using a multistep process electrochemical underpotential deposition (UPD) of Pt and Rh atoms on carbon-supported SnO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles. [36] Later on, the same author and his co-workers reported a set of Pt-Rh-SnO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticle catalysts and suggested twinned Pt-Rh and SnO<sub>2</sub> crystallites with an optimal Pt/Rh/Sn = 3:1:4 ratio.[37-38]. Spinacé et al. reported PtSnRh/C electrocatalysts synthesized via an alcohol-reduction process using ethylene glycol. [39] Du et al. presented the preparation of carbonsupported PtRhSnO<sub>2</sub> nanoclusters with simultaneous reduction of the precursor salts [40] Nina Erini et al. prepared a variety of ternary Pt-Rh-Sn nanoparticle catalysts by varying the sequence in which each metal component entered the synthetic process of the final catalyst material. [41-42]

According to the literature, a consensus is emerging that the catalytic activity of tri-components Pt, Rh, Sn (or SnO<sub>2</sub>) materials is generally superior to that of their binary combinations. Rh is however one of the rarest and most expensive precious metals; therefore, to optimize and reduce Rh content and ultimately to substitute Rh is of great significance in designing practical EOR electrocatalysts. In addition, the arrangement of each element in the electrode structure or architecture strongly influences the catalytic activity towards EOR and only a few papers have discussed that issue. [36-37,41,43]. The reason is probably related to the methods of synthesis of the ternaries, which does not make it possible to control or vary the arrangement of the three constituents in the catalytic layer as long as most of these ternaries have been prepared in the form of a mixture. It should also be added that these mixtures are then put into the form of a composite electrode requiring the addition of a binder (Nafion solution) and conductivity enhancers such as carbons, all which further complicate the electrode structure

Fuel cells technology necessitates porous or very organized layers that can be obtained by thin film growth methods. [44] Plasma techniques, such as pulsed laser deposition (PLD), are increasingly attracting attention as novel routes for the synthesis of nanostructured materials for catalysis and energy materials. Indeed, PLD permits to grow high-quality functional thin films with accurately controlled composition by using pure target materials under controlled inert atmosphere in the deposition chamber<sup>[45-47]</sup>. Therefore, in the grown materials no impurities can be introduced or other additives that can influence the results. In addition, PLD as an on-substrate deposition avoids the use of Nafion and other binders in the catalyst layer, dramatically cutting the cost and the number of manufacturing steps. Moreover, by controlling the number of laser pulses, a reasonable control of film thickness can be attained, which is a benefit over other thin film deposition techniques. Furthermore, since only pure target materials are used under controlled inert atmosphere, the stoichiometry of the target can be retained and no impurities can be introduced in the deposited films. Finally, it is possible to tailor the surface

morphology from smooth to porous by varying the background pressure and the nature of the gas in the deposition chamber. Recently, we have synthesized and characterized several Rh films onto carbon paper substrate (CP) by means of PLD.[48] Thicknesses of ~10 nm, 20 nm, 40 nm and ~200 nm of the Rh films were fabricated by varying the number of laser pulses for the ablation of the Rh target. These films were further studied and compared to Pt for the electrochemical performance towards the tolerance of CO poisoning examined with anodic stripping voltammetry (ASV). These studies revealed that Rh is more tolerant to CO poisoning than Pt. In a subsequent publication, we employed the cross-beam pulsed laser deposition and synthesized and characterized vertically aligned shrub-like porous PtxRh100-x thin film alloys uniformly coating a carbon paper substrate with atomic ratios close to nominal values. [49] The as-grown PtxRh100-x alloys were assessed for tolerance to CO poisoning and for their catalytic activity towards

In this continuity, we present a direct growth on substrate of free-standing (binderless) nanoscale films ternary  $PtRhSnO_2$  materials synthesized for the first time by PLD technique. These films are characterized and evaluated for their electrocatalytic activity and durability capabilities for the oxidative removal of CO and electrooxidation of ethanol. Apart from the synthesis method, which is different from those already reported in the literature, the approach followed here also differs concerning the composition and the structural arrangement of Pt, Rh and  $SnO_2$  in the catalyst layer. To maximize the catalytic activity the following arrangements were studied:

- (i) The substrate chosen is the carbon paper (CP) (standard substrate in fuel cells), which possesses an electronic conductivity lower than other nanostructured carbon materials, such as carbon nanotubes, graphene or other type of activated carbon used in composite electrodes. Like this, all the structural properties and electrochemical performances will reflect the behaviour of PtRhSnO<sub>2</sub> materials in neat form, *i.e.*, no eventual interference of the substrate on the current catalytic activities.
- (ii) In order to investigate the effect of each component on the electrochemical performance in correlation with the physicochemical properties, various catalyst architectures are considered, namely, mono layers of Pt, Rh, SnO<sub>2</sub>, bi-layers of Pt/SnO<sub>2</sub>, Rh/Pt and tri-layers of Rh/Pt/SnO<sub>2</sub> (**Scheme 1**).
- (iii) Since Rh is an expensive metal, the effect of the thickness of Rh film on the electrochemical performance is further considered. The thickness of the Rh film was changed by varying the number of laser pulses during the ablation of the Rh target (Scheme S1).

**Scheme 1.** The different catalyst arrangements studied in this work

The results of these investigations will help gaining understanding on how each component (Pt, Rh,  $SnO_2$ ) affects the whole catalyst structure towards electroactivity and sheds light on the designing of highly active PLD-prepared electrocatalyst for CO and ethanol electrooxidation.

# 2. Results and Discussion

## 2.1. Physico-chemical characterization

Figure 1 reports the cross-section SEM images of the different catalysts, and the top surfaces SEM images are shown in Figure S1. As seen in Figure 1, all the films are vertically aligned on the CP substrate. Figure 1a shows that SnO<sub>2</sub> film has a smooth and very dense morphology, whereas Pt film (Figure 1b) presents a coarse surface. A clear demarcation between the layers of Pt and SnO<sub>2</sub> can be observed with the Pt/SnO<sub>2</sub> sample (Figure 1c). Conversely, in *bi*-layered Rh/Pt and *tri*-layered Rh/Pt/SnO<sub>2</sub> (Figure 1d-h) the boundary line between Pt and Rh layers are not easy to distinguish. Regarding the thickness of Rh layer in these Rh-based catalysts, this was estimated and reported in our previous publication where the thicknesses of for Rh<sub>5</sub>, Rh<sub>10</sub>, Rh<sub>20</sub> and Rh<sub>50</sub> were ca.10 nm, 20 nm, 40 nm and 200 nm, respectively. [48]

Figure 2 corresponds to the XRD patterns of CP, SnO<sub>2</sub>/CP, Pt/CP, Pt/SnO<sub>2</sub>/CP, Rh/Pt/CP and Rh/Pt/SnO<sub>2</sub>/CP samples. The diffraction peaks of the CP substrate are identified with (\*) in the patterns. As can be seen from Figure 2a, XRD pattern of Pt/CP had diffraction peaks at ca. 39.7°, 46.2°, 67.5°, 81.3° and 85.7°, which could be indexed respectively to (111), (200), (220), (311) and (222) planes (JCPDS PDF No. 04-0802) of a face centered cubic (fcc) structure. No SnO2 diffraction peaks could be observed, which indicated that SnO2 existed in the form of very small nanoparticles or as an amorphous phase. XRD patterns of the pure Rh<sub>5</sub>, Rh<sub>10</sub>, Rh<sub>20</sub> and Rh<sub>50</sub> films grown on CP substrate are discussed elsewhere. [48] Briefly, the patterns did not reveal any visible Rh diffraction peaks in Rh<sub>5</sub>, Rh<sub>10</sub> and Rh<sub>20</sub> films, which was ascribed to either to a highly dispersed (low content of Rh) or in amorphous nanoparticles. Only the Rh<sub>50</sub> displayed a weak diffraction peak Rh (111) at  $2\theta = 40.8^{\circ}$ . Similarly, no Rh diffraction peaks were detected in bi-layered Rh/Pt and tri-layered Rh/Pt/SnO<sub>2</sub> samples (Figure 2b-c). But the existence of SnO<sub>2</sub> and Rh could be evidenced by XPS analysis hereafter.

The most intensive peak is Pt (111), hence it was used to estimate the average crystallite size (CS) and the lattice constant a by Debye-Scherrer equation and Bragg's law, respectively. The corresponding results are summarized in Table S1. It can be seen that individual Pt/CP (benchmark sample) had a CS of 75.23 Å, a=3.923 Å and positioned at  $2\theta$  of 39.84 degrees. While CS of Pt in the bi-layer Pt/SnO2 decreased, there were no significant changes in a and  $2\theta$ . The decrease of the CS can be explained by the fact the SnO2 provided better dispersion of the Pt nanoparticles, which might increase the active surface area of the catalyst and its better utilization for the electroactivity. Similarly, CS decreased in Rh/Pt/CP and Rh/Pt/SnO<sub>2</sub>/CP materials. Compared with Pt/CP, the lattice parameters of the Rh<sub>5</sub>/Pt/CP and Rh<sub>5</sub>/Pt/SnO<sub>2</sub>/CP catalysts were slightly larger and the corresponding Pt (111) peak shifted to lower  $2\theta$ . These variations might have been due to the decrease in particle size that brings about lattice strain, resulting in lattice expansion.

XPS measurements were conducted to further characterize the chemical compositions and valence states of the surface catalysts. The survey scans of the different structures as-prepared catalysts are reported displayed in Figure S2-S3. As shown in the survey scans of the SnO<sub>2</sub>/CP, it revealed that Sn, C and O were the only three elements existing on the surface (Figure S2). Whereas in Pt/SnO<sub>2</sub>/CP, only Pt, C and O were detected, indicating that the Pt film homogenously coats the SnO<sub>2</sub> film (Figure S2). In the survey of Rh<sub>5</sub>/Pt and Rh<sub>5</sub>/Pt/SnO<sub>2</sub> catalysts, C, O, Rh and weak intensity of Pt can be found (Figure S2 and S3). Nevertheless, when  $\textit{M}_{\rm IP,Rh} > 5000$ , no Pt signal can be noticed, which suggested that Rh film fully coated the beneath Pt layer.

The typical high-resolution XPS of the Sn 3d, Pt 4f, and Rh 3d core level spectra are shown in Figure 3. The core-levels of Sn 3d in SnO<sub>2</sub>/CP and Pt/SnO<sub>2</sub>/CP could be satisfactorily deconvoluted into one doublet, which located at 486.85 eV (Sn 3d<sub>5/2</sub>) and 495.20 eV (Sn 3d<sub>3/2</sub>) with a spin-orbit splitting of 8.40 eV, revealing tin was in oxidized state (Sn<sup>4+</sup>).<sup>[50]</sup> In addition, the SnO<sub>2</sub> phase could also be confirmed by analyzing the O 1s spectrum (not shown here). The O 1s spectrum could be fittingly deconvoluted into two peaks, the first one centered at high binding energy (BE) (532.6 eV), was ascribed to "chemisorbed oxygen" on the surface, and the low BE positioned ca. 530.5 eV, which was assigned to Sn4+-O bond.[51] The Pt 4f core level in the Pt/CP could be satisfactorily fitted by a single component with an asymmetric profile exhibiting a doublet at low BE (Pt  $4f_{7/2}$ ) of 71.43 eV and at high BE (Pt  $4f_{5/2}$ ) of 74.73 eV, with the typical spin-energy separation of ca. 3.3 eV. The 3.3 eV BE difference between the Pt  $4f_{7/2}$  and Pt  $4f_{5/2}$  is in accordance with Pt being in a metallic state. [52] The Pt 4f<sub>7/2</sub> position in the Pt/SnO<sub>2</sub>/CP shifted to higher BE by 0.30 eV compared to the mono metallic Pt/CP. Despite this shift, the BE difference

between Pt  $4f_{7/2}$ and Pt  $4f_{5/2}$  remains the same as 3.3 eV signifying no change in the electronic structure of Pt grown onto the SnO<sub>2</sub> layer. One effect stemming from these interactions would be the reduction of the Pt particle size by SnO<sub>2</sub> as observed with XRD analysis. The *BE*s of the Pt  $4f_{7/2}$  peaks in Rh<sub>5</sub>/Pt and Rh<sub>5</sub>/Pt/SnO<sub>2</sub> were lower than that of the bare Pt/CP (Table S2).

Figure 3 and Figure S4 display the typical high-resolution XPS Rh 3d core level obtained at all the Rh-containing catalysts and Table S2 summarizes the relevant parameters of these spectra. The position of the Rh 3d<sub>5/2</sub> and Rh 3d<sub>3/2</sub> and the BE separation between them indicated that Rh, in all cases, was in metallic state. Table S2 further shows the atomic ratio of Rh and Pt in the catalysts. The [Rh]/[Pt] in Rh<sub>5</sub>/Pt/CP, Rh<sub>10</sub>/Pt/CP and Rh<sub>5</sub>/Pt/SnO<sub>2</sub>/CP are 5, 14.6 and 20.3, respectively. As can be seen, no clear trend is observed in the BEs of the Rh 3d<sub>5/2</sub> peak in the bi and tri-layered catalysts. However, compared to the corresponding monometallic Rh<sub>5</sub>/CP (307.43 eV), Rh<sub>10</sub>/CP (307.35 eV), Rh<sub>20</sub>/CP (307.30 eV) and Rh<sub>50</sub>/CP (307.26 eV), [48] the Rh 3d<sub>5/2</sub> in these former shift towards higher binding energies. Fang et al prepared  $Rh_x/5\%$  Pt/Graphite with 0 < x < 2monolayer equivalents and studied their performance as catalysts for CO electrooxidation. [53] The authors noticed that the BE of the Pt  $4f_{7/2}$  peak did not change as x increased, concluding that emission from the underlying Pt phase is not influenced by Rh deposition. Hence, they asserted that no intermixing of Rh with Pt took place at room temperature. On the other hand, upon annealing the Rh adlayers at 700 K, the authors noticed a small shift of 0.1 eV to higher binding energies of the Pt 4f and concluded that an RhPt alloy phase had been formed following thermal treatment. However in our PLDsynthesized catalysts, the core levels of Pt and Rh shifted in opposite directions with respect to their bulk counterparts for Rh<sub>5</sub>/Pt/CP, Rh<sub>10</sub>/Pt/CP and Rh<sub>5</sub>/Pt/SnO<sub>2</sub>/CP. This cannot be explained by the difference in the electronegativity since both Pt and Rh have similar electronegativity of 2.28 on the Pauling scale. Thus, neither XRD nor XPS suggest the formation of PtRh alloy. Instead, it suggests that with a very small thickness of Rh, a strong interaction exists between the metals, with possible formation of strongly linked structure morphology between Rh and Pt. As to bigger thicknesses of Rh, XPS confirms that the Rh is growing via a simple layer-by-layer mechanism (which is confirmed from the deductions of the electrochemical studies below).

#### 2.2. Electrochemical characterization

Figure 4 shows the CVs profiles of the synthesized catalysts in  $0.5 \text{ M H}_2\text{SO}_4$  solution at the scan rate 50 mV s<sup>-1</sup>. As can be seen from Figure 4a, the current density of  $\text{SnO}_2/\text{CP}$  was very small, signifying that  $\text{SnO}_2$  has less or no contribution for hydrogen adsorption/desorption ( $\text{H}_{\text{ads/des}}$ ). As for the Pt/CP and

Pt/SnO<sub>2</sub>/CP electrodes, there are the well-known hydrogen adsorption (Hads) and desorption (Hdes) peaks in the potential region of hydrogen region (ca. -0.2 to -0.05 V), indicating the contributions of various Pt (hkl) facets. [54-56] It also reflects that SnO<sub>2</sub> does not modify the electronic structure of Pt. On the contrary, with the addition of SnO2 to Pt, the Pt/SnO2/CP has higher H<sub>ads/des</sub> current density, which means Pt/SnO<sub>2</sub>/CP has higher surface area than that of Pt/CP. The higher surface area denotes lower particle size, confirming by that SnO2 improved the dispersion and utilization of the Pt nanoparticles, which is in line with the XRD analyses. Besides, the addition of SnO2 to Pt also results in higher capacitive current in double layer region (0.05 - 0.5 V), which can be ascribed to the hydrophilic nature of SnO<sub>2</sub>. In the oxygen region (0.5 -1.0 V), the onset potential of surface oxidation formation shifts negatively in PtSnO2/CP when compared with Pt/CP. It implies that SnO2 can provide oxygeneous species at lower potentials, which will facilitate the removal of CO-like intermediates and accelerate EOR.

As displayed in Figure 4b and 4c of Pt-Rh-based electrodes, the Hads/des peaks become ill-defined and the double layer and oxygen region are overlapped. At the tri-layered Rh/Pt/SnO<sub>2</sub> catalysts (Figure 4c), the current densities were all increased compared to bi-layered Pt/SnO2 (Figure 4a) and Rh/Pt catalysts (Figure 4b). It is observed that the CV profiles of Rh<sub>5</sub>/Pt, Rh<sub>10</sub>/Pt, Rh<sub>5</sub>/Pt/SnO<sub>2</sub> and Rh<sub>10</sub>/Pt/SnO<sub>2</sub> are in between the Pt/CP and Rh/CP, where characteristics of both Pt and Rh can be seen. However, as the Rh thickness increased, Rh20/Pt/SnO2 and Rh<sub>50</sub>/Pt/SnO<sub>2</sub> exhibited the typical CV behavior of pure Rh, which indicates Rh is the main species on the surface, which is in agreement with XPS results. The CVs of pure Rh thin films Rh<sub>5</sub>, Rh<sub>10</sub>, Rh<sub>20</sub> and Rh<sub>50</sub> films grown on CP substrate in 0.5 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> recorded with 50 mV s<sup>-1</sup> scan rate are presented and discussed in our previous publication.<sup>[48]</sup> It can be further noticed that the onset potential for the oxide formation and its corresponding reduction peak on Pt-Rh-based electrodes shifted to negative values, which is attributed to oxophilic character of

Figure 4. Cyclic voltammograms in 0.5 M  $\rm H_2SO_4$  solution recorded with a scan rate of 50 mV s<sup>-1</sup>.

The electrochemically active surface area ( $ESA = Q_H/(Q_{ref})$ ) for each Pt-containing catalyst was evaluated from the electric charge for the hydrogen desorption ( $Q_H$ ) wave associated with a monolayer hydrogen adsorbed on polycrystalline platinum ( $Q_{ref} = 210 \,\mu\text{C cm}^{-2}$ ). The area specific activity ( $ASA = Q_H/(Q_{ref} \times m_{Pt} \times A_g)$ ) to generate mass activity and the roughness factor ( $RF = ESA/A_g$ ) were also calculated. Here  $m_{Pt}$  and  $A_g$  represent the Pt loading (120  $\mu$ g cm<sup>-2</sup>) and the geometric electrode area (cm<sup>2</sup>), respectively. As calculated ESA, ASA and RF are gathered in Table S3, which shows that the tri-layered catalysts displayed electroactivity significantly greater than the bi-layered ones. ESAs calculated considering a monolayer of hydrogen adsorbed on polycrystalline Rh ( $Q_{ref} = 221 \,\mu\text{C cm}^{-2}$ ) are also reported in Table S3 for referencing, where we can see that there is no significant difference with ESAs normalized to Pt.

#### 2.2.1. Electrocatalytic Ethanol Oxidation Activity

Figure 5 shows LSVs corresponding to EOR recorded with a scan rate of 5 mV s<sup>-1</sup> in 0.5 M  $H_2SO_4+$  1 M  $C_2H_5OH$  solution. With the exception of SnO2 and pure Rh (Rh alone is less capable than Pt for the dehydrogenation of ethanol), which are known not to be active towards the oxidation of ethanol, all other catalysts displayed characteristic EOR waves.[58-59] In order to evaluate the electrocatalytic activity of the different catalysts towards EOR, several relevant experimental parameters extracted from the LSVs of Figure 5 are reported in Table 2. E<sub>onset</sub> is defined here as the potential at which the anodic current due to EOR begins to flow. E<sub>onset</sub>@5 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> is an arbitrary criterion selected to compare the current catalytic activity at potentials lower than the peak potential.  $E_p$  and  $j_p$  are respectively the anodic peak potential and its corresponding peak current density, whereas SMA is the specific mass activity (peak current divided by the Pt loading). From Table 2, we observed no significant difference in E<sub>D</sub> and E<sub>Onset</sub>@5 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> values for all the catalysts. However, Pt/SnO<sub>2</sub>/CP and Rh<sub>5</sub>/Pt/SnO<sub>2</sub>/CP displayed the lowest E<sub>onset</sub> of about 64 mV negative than that of Pt/CP. As the EOR progressed, it was clear to see that the current density activity of the  $Rh_5/Pt/SnO_2/CP$  outperformed the other catalysts both at 0.45 V and 0.6 V. The  $Rh_5/Pt/SnO_2/CP$  showed the highest SMA of 179.4 mA  $mg^{-1}_{Pt}$ , which was 2.25 and

1.12 times higher than that those of Pt/CP and Pt/SnO $_2$ /CP, respectively.

Chronoamperometric (CA) experiments were conducted to examine the catalytic performance and catalysts stability at 0.6 V for an extended period of 1 hour. In Figure 6, one can observe that with the exception of pure Rh, the current decay for the EOR on the other catalysts is significantly slower than that on the bare Pt/CP. After 3600 s, the steady-state current density ( $j_{ss}$ ) is also much higher than that of Pt/CP. As can be seen in Table 3, obviously, the Rh<sub>5</sub>/Pt/SnO<sub>2</sub>/CP is superior the other catalysts. Like observed in the LSV performance, Pt/SnO<sub>2</sub>/CP is second to Rh<sub>5</sub>/Pt/SnO<sub>2</sub>/CP in terms of current density or specific mass activity. The poisoning rates ( $\delta$  % s<sup>-1</sup>) on the different architectured catalysts were calculated on the basis of equation 1:<sup>[59]</sup>

$$\delta = \frac{100}{I_0} \times \left(\frac{dI}{dt}\right)_{t > 500s} (\% \ s^{-1}) \tag{1}$$

where  $(dl/dt)_{t>500s}$  is the slope of the linear portion of the current decay and  $l_0$  is the current at the start of polarization back extrapolated from the linear current decay. The calculated poisoning rate  $\delta$  values are presented in Table 3. It is evident that catalysts with very thin layers of Rh best control the poisoning effect of EOR and this is concurrent with the results of the voltammetric experiments. It is interesting to notice that the Pt/SnO<sub>2</sub>/CP, which has demonstrated one of the best voltammetric activities, shows one of the highest poisoning rates among all the catalysts. For catalysts having thick layers of Rh, their poisoning rates attain those of Pt/CP and Pt/SnO<sub>2</sub>/CP probably due to the corrosion of Rh.

#### 2.2.2. Electrocatalytic CO Oxidation Activity

In order to further comprehend the EOR durability and high steady-state current observed with chronoamperometry, the CO stripping experiments were utilized for evaluating  $\mathsf{CO}_{\mathsf{ads}}$ poisoning tolerance capability of the PLD grown catalysts. The CO-ASVs of Rh<sub>5</sub>, Rh<sub>10</sub>, Rh<sub>20</sub> and Rh<sub>50</sub> films grown by PLD on CP substrate are reported and discussed in our previous publication. [48] The CO-stripping initiates at 0.52 V (Rh<sub>5</sub>/CP),  $0.48 \text{ V } (Rh_{10}/CP), 0.47 \text{ V } (Rh_{20}/CP) \text{ and } 0.46 \text{ V } (Rh_{50}/CP)$ negative than that of Pt<sub>50</sub>/CP (0.6 V). This was interpreted on the basis that Rh as an oxophilic metal d-band center (-1.73 eV) lower than that of Pt (-2.25 eV) can provide oxygenic or OH species at potentials lower than that of Pt, which also concurred the observations in CO-free electrolyte. [48] Figure S5 reports the two CV cycles recorded during and after anodic oxidation of adsorbed CO at all catalysts considered in this work. The hydrogen profile region in the second CV cycle is similar to that recorded before CO adsorption indicating that the entire adsorbed CO was totally oxidized and stripped from the electrode surface throughout the first cycle. Figure 7 presents only the CO anodic stripping profiles and their relevant characteristics reported in Table 4. It can be seen that SnO<sub>2</sub> has no active for CO oxidation. Compared to Pt/CP, all the other catalysts delivered lower onset (E<sub>onset-CO-ox</sub>) and peak potentials  $(E_{p-CO-ox})$  of CO oxidation, demonstrating a better CO-poisoning tolerance, especially in Pt/SnO<sub>2</sub>/CP and Rh<sub>5</sub>/Pt/SnO<sub>2</sub>/CP exhibiting the most significant shift. We can also see that  $E_{\text{p-CO-ox}}$ moved towards positive values as the Rh thickness increased in the tri-layered catalysts. Based on the assumption of 0.420 □C cm<sup>-2</sup> surface charges for linearly adsorbed CO, ESA<sub>CO-ox</sub> and ASA<sub>CO-ox</sub> were calculated from to the CO stripping peak (Table 4).

# 3. Discussion

Because different synthetic methods can generate multicomponent catalysts with different compositions, interactions and structures, we stress that our interpretations are based only on the catalyst structures developed here by the PLD method and may differ with few other observations for the same materials synthesized by other methods. With the PLD technique, the film thickness can be controlled by varying the number of laser pulses  $(N_p)$ . [60] A very low  $N_p$  generates a deposition of disperse nano/micro-particles on the substrate surface. Slightly increasing  $N_{lp}$  produces islands of material or intimately connected nanoparticles (Scheme S1). Upon increasing  $N_{\rm p}$ , the substrate is covered by a continuous thin film and even thicker with 50000 N<sub>ID</sub>. [61] Thus, based on our experimental observations, the Scheme 2 below illustrates our mechanistic interpretations with regard to CO and EOR processes according to the arrangement of the component catalysts as synthesized by PLD.

**Scheme 2.** CO electrooxidation (top panel) and EOR (bottom panel). *Monolayers*: (a) pure Pt, (a') pure Rh. *Bi-layers*: (b) Pt/SnO<sub>2</sub>, (b') low content of Rh and (b") high content of Rh. *Tri-layers*: (c) low content of Rh and (c") high content of Rh.

#### 3.1. CO-tolerance mechanism (Scheme 2, top panel)

It is clear that between Rh and Pt, the electrooxidation of adsorbed CO initiates at lower potentials at the former catalyst. Therefore, it can be assumed that on both pure Pt and Rh surfaces, the commonly admitted Langmuir-Hinshelwood. [62] mechanism applies (Eq. 2 through 5) with the only difference that Rh provides more oxygen-containing species than Pt for the electrooxidation of CO to CO<sub>2</sub>. The high  $ESA_{CO-Ox}$  values delivered by Rh<sub>50</sub> clearly demonstrate that it is 4 times tolerant than Pt synthesized with similar  $N_{ID}$  of 50000.

(a) Single-layered catalysts

-On pure Pt (Scheme 2a):

$$H_2O + *Pt \rightarrow OH_{ads,Pt} + H^+ + e^-$$
 (2)

$$CO_{ads,Pt} + OH_{ads,Pt} \rightarrow CO_2 + H^{\dagger} + e^{-} + 2^*Pt$$
 (3)

- On pure Rh (Scheme 2a'):[47]

$$H_2O + *Rh \rightarrow OH_{ads,Rh} + H^{\dagger} + e^{-}$$
 (4)

$$CO_{ads,Rh} + OH_{ads,Rh} \rightarrow CO_2 + H^{\dagger} + e^{-} + 2 *Rh$$
 (5)

i.e. with the participation of two adsorbed species, where the adsorbed CO reacts with adsorbed hydroxide issued from water dissociative adsorption ("\*" indicates the edge sites).

(b) Bi-layered catalysts

- On Pt/SnO<sub>2</sub> (Scheme 2b)

As observed in Figure 7a and Figure S5a,  $SnO_2$  has no catalytic activity towards CO electrooxidation and thus does not have any affinity toward CO adsorption. However, when used as a support,  $SnO_2$  had a direct influence on the electrochemical properties of Pt judging from  $E_{onset-CO-ox}$  and  $E_{p-CO-ox}$  (Table 4). This early onset of CO oxidation on the Pt/ $SnO_2$  catalyst as compared to Pt

signifies that a certain amount of oxygenated species are already adsorbed on the Pt surface at quite low potentials in the double-layer region (Figure 7a) and this is a clear observation of the promotion of CO electrooxidation by a bifunctional mechanism. [63] Indeed, the CO stripping voltammogram splits into two peaks (P1 at 0.5 V, and P2 at 0.58 V in Figure 7a) instead of one voltammetric peak as observed with Pt catalyst (Figure 7a). The two-peak voltammetric behavior has been observed with PtRu electrodes, [64] and with Pt/CeO2/CNT catalyst. [65] This behavior was considered to reflect the existence of two kinds of CO species: CO species adsorbed at either Ru (or CeO<sub>2</sub>) sites or at Pt sites neighboring in Ru (or CeO<sub>2</sub>) sites and CO species adsorbed at Pt sites far away from Ru (or CeO<sub>2</sub>) sites. CO oxidation at the former sites takes place under lower potential than at the later sites. The slow CO diffusion between these two kinds of sites results in a two-peak behavior. Therefore, by analogy to the PtRu and Pt/CeO<sub>2</sub> systems, [64-65] we may describe the happening of the split peaks by the involvement of hydroxyl groups on SnO2. SnO2 adjacent to Pt sites mainly provides the oxygen-containing species. The reaction equations may be expressed as:

$$H_2O + *SnO_2 \rightarrow OH_{ads,SnO_2} + H^+ + e^-$$
 (6)  
 $CO_{ads,Pl} + OH_{ads,SnO_2} \rightarrow CO_2 + H^+ + e^- + *Pt + *SnO_2$  (7)

### - On Rh/Pt (Scheme 2b'-b")

Both  $E_{\text{onset-CO-ox}}$  and  $E_{\text{P-CO-ox}}$  at the Rh/Pt are negative than those at Pt. However, this potential shift towards lower values is not as significant as that observed with Pt/SnO<sub>2</sub> (Table 4) indicating a different CO electrooxidation mechanism with the Rh/Pt system. This is also further confirmed by the absence of split peak. In addition, the  $E_{\text{p-CO-ox}}$  at Rh/Pt is close to P2 position observed in Pt/SnO<sub>2</sub> catalyst. Therefore, for the Rh/Pt system, the CO electrooxidation mechanism can be thought of as a competition between Pt and Rh, i.e., Rh, as a more oxophilic transition metal than Pt, initiates water dissociation at lower potentials than Pt, suggesting a faster and higher supply in OH<sub>ads</sub> (higher  $ESA_{\text{CO-ox}}$ ), and the reaction mechanism would most likely be the same as reactions (4) and (5).

### (c) Tri-layered catalysts (Scheme 2c-c')

For the tri-layered catalysts, the CO tolerance is strongly influenced by the thickness of Rh laver (Table 4). As the thickness of Rh layer increased, both Eonset-CO-ox and Eo-CO-ox shifted to positive values approaching those of pure Rh. Interestingly, the CO oxidation reaction takes place in a broad potential region at Rh<sub>5</sub>/Pt/SnO<sub>2</sub> (Figure 7c and S5f), with an  $E_{\text{onset-CO-ox}}$  and  $E_{\text{p-CO-ox}}$  very close to those of Pt/SnO<sub>2</sub> catalyst. However the former catalysts exhibited higher ESA<sub>CO-ox</sub> than the latter. These seem to indicate that the three constituents (Pt. SnO<sub>2</sub> and Rh) participate in the mechanism of CO electrooxidation (Scheme 2c). On the other hand, with the thickness of Rh becoming thicker (Scheme 2c'), the surface of the tri-lavered catalyst is fully covered with Rh and thus CO mechanism will be as same as reactions (4) and (5). Even though all Rh/Pt/SnO<sub>2</sub> catalysts produced ESA<sub>CO-ox</sub> values greater than those of Pt and Pt/SnO<sub>2</sub>, E<sub>onset-CO-ox</sub> of CO electrooxidation remains the decisive factor for low temperature fuel cell applications, since CO adsorbs at lower potentials.

#### 3.2. EOR (Scheme 2, bottom panel)

The EOR is a complex mechanism, which can proceed through different reaction pathways. [66] The main EOR pathway, known as the complete EOR, involves the generation of 12 electrons and the production of CO2 as final reaction product. Pure platinum electrodes are quickly poisoned by the EOR intermediates like  ${\rm CO_{ad}}$  and  ${\rm CH_{x,ad}}^{[17]}$  leading to slow EOR kinetics and low potential efficiencies. Addition of SnO2 to Pt electrocatalyst leads to a negative shift of the EOR onset potential (Table 2). However, SnO<sub>2</sub> is unable to facilitate the C-C bond cleavage, it will thus only improve the selectivity of the EOR towards acetic acid formation, due to its capability of providing adsorbed OH-species at low potentials. [3,54,67] The onset potentials of EOR at Rh/Pt catalysts are very close to that on Pt (Table 2). Nevertheless, the EOR current densities and mass activities on the former catalysts are higher than on Pt, probably because Rh presents the ability to enhance the cleavage of the C-C bond. However, the electroactivity performance of the Rh/Pt catalyst is lower than that of the Pt/SnO<sub>2</sub>. A significant distinction that should be taken into account between Rh and SnO2 is that the latter does not have any affinity towards CO adsorption whereas the reaction proceeds easily on Rh, which suggests that Pt/Rh and Pt/SnO<sub>2</sub> should be considered as completely different electrocatalysts towards EOR. On the contrary, great enhancements in the current densities are observed with the tri-layered catalysts Rh/Pt/SnO<sub>2</sub> (Table 2). It is interesting to note that only Rh<sub>5</sub>/Pt/SnO<sub>2</sub> has shown a similar onset potential with Pt/SnO<sub>2</sub> catalyst but the former's current activities were greater than the latter. Since a low oxidation potential of CO and a high current activity at these potentials are indicative of high-performing catalyst towards EOR, then within the catalysts developed here by PLD technique, Rh<sub>5</sub> (~10 nm thickness)/Pt/SnO<sub>2</sub>/CP is the optimum formulation of the catalyst architecture. It can thus be assumed that a low thickness (small amount) of Rh promotes the cleavage of the C-C bond, SnO<sub>2</sub> provides OH-species at low potential and frees Rh (and Pt) from the hydroxide adsorbates. It is understood that spectroscopic techniques such as FTIR or PM\_IRRAS will be needed to analyze in-situ the intermediates and the products formed upon electrooxidation of ethanol at the catalysts developed here, and by that would help to reveal the reaction mechanisms and kinetics of EOR, and the impact either negative or positive brought by each component of the electrocatalysts towards the complete oxidation of ethanol to CO<sub>2</sub>. Such studies are planned for the near future.

#### 4. Conclusion

In this study, by means of the pulsed laser deposition method, we prepared Pt, bi-layered Pt/SnO<sub>2</sub>, Rh/Pt and tri-layered Rh/Pt/SnO<sub>2</sub> electrocatalysts with various thicknesses of the Rh layer. Their physicochemical properties were characterized by SEM, XRD and XPS. In addition, CO, EOR activity and durability for the as-PLD grown catalysts were evaluated. The obtained results are summarized as follows:

-In H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> electrolyte, the oxide region on Rh- and SnO<sub>2</sub>-based electrocatalysts, *i.e.* on Rh/CP, Rh/Pt/CP, Pt/SnO<sub>2</sub>/CP, Rh/Pt/SnO<sub>2</sub>/CP, starts at much lower potentials than on Pt/CP, which may be ascribed to the oxophilic character of rhodium and tin oxide. The oxide reduction also starts at lower potentials on

Rh- and SnO<sub>2</sub>-based electrocatalysts, showing the higher oxides stability on the electrocatalysts.

-The problem is inherent in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) and DEFCs (in the present case) where the practical operating low temperatures and potentials hinder the electrooxidation of strongly adsorbed carbon monoxide. A comparison between Pt/CP and on Rh- and SnO2-based electrocatalysts shows that the electrooxidation of CO initiates at lower potentials on the latters than on the former. The presence of two oxophilic materials SnO2 and Rh, likely suggests a faster (more efficient at low potential) supply in OHads-species, which helps the oxidation of adsorbed CO.

-In Pt/SnO<sub>2</sub>/CP, SnO<sub>2</sub> is never covered by CO<sub>ads</sub>-species and can provide OHads all along the stripping voltammogram, which explains the enhancement of EOR displayed by the Pt/SnO<sub>2</sub>/CP against Pt/CP, Rh/Pt/CP and the high thickness of Rh in the trilayered electrocatalysts. However, a tri-layered electrocatalyst with the lowest thickness of Rh (lower amount) displayed best durability and the highest electrocatalytic activity towards EOR at low potentials and specific mass activity about 2.25 and 1.12 times higher than the Pt/CP and Pt/SnO2/CP catalysts, respectively. These results might indicate that the C-C bond can be activated with a small amount of Rh. It is believed that the Rh<sub>5</sub>/Pt/SnO<sub>2</sub>/CP thus provides a promising EOR catalyst for DEFC. In addition, the thin film growth method presented here will be important for fuel cell technology or energy storage systems that will inevitably be to require porous and binderless very organized multicatalytic layers.

# 5. Experimental Section

#### 5.1. Chemicals and materials

In this project, the substrate is the untreated CP (Toray), which also acts as the current collector. High purity PLD-targets  ${\rm SnO_2}$  (99.99%), Rh (99.8%) and Pt (99.99%) were purchased from Kurt J. Lesker Co. Sulfuric acid (96% purity) and ethanol (100% purity) solutions were acquired from Agros Organics and Commercial Alcohols Inc., respectively. These chemicals were used as received.

#### 5.2. Synthesis

PLD was carried out at room temperature and ablating the pure targets by means of a pulsed KrF excimer laser ( $\lambda = 248$  nm, pulse width  $\Box = 17$ ns and repetition rate = 50 Hz) using Helium as background gas. Prior to synthesis, the pressure in a stainless-steel ultra-high vacuum chamber was pumped to a base pressure of  $4 \times 10^{-5}$  Torr by a turbo bump. Then the chamber was filled with high-purity He (Helium N5.0, Praxair) at the established He background pressure. The substrate-to-target distance was set to 5 cm. More information regarding the working principle of the PLD can be found elsewhere [45-47] We synthesized mono-layered catalysts SnO2, Pt and Rh; bi-layered Pt/SnO2, Rh5/Pt and Rh10/Pt; trilayered catalysts Rh<sub>5</sub>/Pt/SnO<sub>2</sub>, Rh<sub>10</sub>/Pt/SnO<sub>2</sub>, Rh<sub>20</sub>/Pt/SnO<sub>2</sub> and Rh<sub>50</sub>/Pt/SnO<sub>2</sub>. In Rh-based catalysts, the numbers of laser pulses of Rh  $(N_{10},Rh)$  of 5000, 10000, 20000, and 50000 are denoted as Rh<sub>5</sub>, Rh<sub>10</sub>, Rh<sub>20</sub> and Rh<sub>50</sub>, respectively. The deposition parameters of the corresponding targets are listed in Table 1.

#### 5.3 Material characterization

The surface morphology of the as-prepared samples was examined by means of a scanning electron microscope (SEM, JEOL, JSM 7401 F apparatus). The measurements were performed in a working pressure of 8 x10<sup>-6</sup> mbar with an accelerating voltage of 10 kV, and the working distance was 10 mm. The crystalline structure of all samples was determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer equipped with a Cu K $\alpha$  source ( $\lambda$  = 1.5406 Å). The tube current was 40 mA with a tube voltage of 40 kV. All diffractograms were acquired in the Grazing Incidence Diffraction (GID) scan mode with a low incident angle of  $2^{\circ}$  and a  $2\theta$  angular step size of  $0.04^{\circ}$  with an acquisition time of 4 s per step in the range of 20-90°.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were carried out via a VG Escalab 220i-XL set with Al Kα source (1486.6 eV). The anode was operated at 10 kV and 20 mA. The pass energy of the analyzer was fixed at 20 eV. The base pressure of the system was 10-9 mbar. All samples were analyzed with a spot size of 250×1000 µm located approximately in the center of the sample. A survey spectrum ranging from 0 to 1350 eV was first acquired, followed by the higher resolution multiplex scan spectra (Pt 4f, Sn 3d, Rh 3d, O 1s, and C 1s core levels) were obtained. Quantification of the elements was performed with Casa XPS software version 2.3.23 Pr 1.0 (Casa Software Ltd.) by fitting the core level spectra after a Shirley background removal. The metallic components of the Pt 4f and Rh 3d region were fitted using a Gaussian/Lorentzian asymmetrically modified line shape, and symmetrical Gaussian/Lorentzian were used to fit other components. The C 1s core level peak at 284.6 eV, resulting from hydrocarbon contaminants at the surface, was taken as an internal reference binding energy for charge correction.

#### 5.4. Electrochemical measurements

#### 5.4.1. Electroactivity and durability towards EOR

The electrocatalytic characterizations were evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) in a three-compartment electrochemical cell. A platinum coil worked as the counter electrode, the synthesized samples as working electrodes and the Ag/AgCl, 4M NaCl as reference electrode. Before each test, dissolved oxygen was removed from the solution by bubbling argon for 30 min. Where after, the working electrode was put into the solution for 30 CV cycles at a sweep rate of 50 mV s<sup>-1</sup> within the potential range of -0.2 to 1.0 V (vs Ag/AgCl). Therefore, a clean and completely activated surface of working electrodes was obtained. Afterwards, the deaerated solution of 0.5 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> + 1 M C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OH was bubbled with argon for 15 minutes before setting up electrode-activation and EOR experiment. The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was conducted at the potential range of  $0 \le E \le 1 \text{ V}$  with guasi-steady state potential scan rate of v = 5 mV s<sup>-1</sup>. The electrochemical data acquisition was recorded by a computer-controlled potentiostat-galvanostat (Autolab, PGSTAT 20, GPES). All the currents are normalized by the geometric area of the working electrode (0.308 cm<sup>2</sup>) and are given in unit of (mA cm<sup>-2</sup>). The experiments were performed at ambient temperature (22 ± 0.5 °C). The Pt loading in all cases was 120 μg cm<sup>-2</sup> (measured by neutron activation analysis, NAA). The durability studies were conducted by chronoamperometry (CA) in the solution of 0.5 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> containing 1 M C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OH at an anodic potential of 0.6 V for 3600 seconds.

#### 5.4.2. Tolerance to CO poisoning

To evaluate resistance to CO poisoning on the catalysts during EOR, CO stripping tests were investigated by ASV technique. After 30 min N<sub>2</sub> bubbling in the 0.5 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> solution, the electrode surface was activated by potential cycling to steady state for 30 cycles with  $v = 50 \text{ mV s}^{-1}$  within -0.197 to 1.03 V vs Ag/AgCl under continuous flow of N2. Afterwards, pure CO (99.5%) was bubbled into the 0.5 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> solution at a polarized potential of 0 V vs Ag/AgCl for 30 min to allow adsorption of CO onto the surface of the working electrode. Subsequently, the potential being maintained constant, pure N<sub>2</sub> was bubbled for 30 min to eliminate residual dissolved CO in the solution. Finally, ASVs were recorded between -0.2 to 1 V at 50 mV s<sup>-1</sup> for two cycles. The first ASV cycle served to calculate the total charge of CO oxidation, while the second cycle aided to confirm that the adsorbed CO was completely removed from the electrode surface.

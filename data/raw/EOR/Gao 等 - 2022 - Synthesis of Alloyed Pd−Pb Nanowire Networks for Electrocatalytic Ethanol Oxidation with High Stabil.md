**Abstract:** Nowadays, with the importance of energy problems, alloyed palladium-based electrocatalysts in low-dimension have become more and more popular in electrocatalysis. Here Pd Pb nanowire networks (NNWs) were synthesized hydrothermally with different Pd/Pb molar ratios from 8 :1 to 3:1 and they exhibited excellent electrochemical performance toward ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR). Pd6Pb1 NNW presented the network structure along with the smallest diameter and exhibited a high catalytic activity, excellent stability and great toxicity resistance toward EOR in alkaline conditions. The catalytic current density of the Pd6Pb1 NNW for EOR under alkaline conditions was 2344 mAmg <sup>1</sup> , while 2174, 1936 and 1728 mAmg <sup>1</sup> for Pd8Pb1, Pd4Pb1 and Pd3Pb1 NNWs, respectively. It was worth mentioning that Pd6Pb1 NNW had a low activity loss and ended with 92.9% of its own maximum current density after 300 cycling, much better than that of commercial Pd/C. The positive correlation effects of catalytic temperatures and concentrations of KOH and/or ethanol concentrations for Pd Pb NNWs were observed and discussed based on the electrochemical measurements.

# **Introduction**

Direct ethanol fuel cells (DEFCs) are excellent alternative power sources proposed to deal with the world-wide serious problems such as the shortage of fossil energy and the greenhouse effect.[1–9] There are many advantages for DEFCs, such as high energy conversion efficiency and non-/low-toxic features.[10,11] DEFCs output electricity converted from chemical energy. However, the dynamic process of ethanol oxidation reaction is limited by high activation energy of the intermolecular fracture.[12] Consequently, it is urgent to find an efficient catalyst to lower the activation energy of the reaction to make the fuel cell better applied.[13–16] Although Pt was confirmed as an excellent electrocatalyst, it is not suitable for large-scale use owing to its low storage.[17–20] Great efforts have transferred to seek for other alternative catalysts, like Pd, the same family as Pt, which has attracted great interests in recent years.[21–26]

Aiming to improve the catalytic ability, a large number of experiments have been conducted to find stable alloyed palladium-based binary nanostructured catalysts (Pd Au,[27–31] Pd Co,[32–34] Pd Ni,[35,36] Pd Cu,[37–40] Pd Ag,[41–45] etc.) with excellent performance and long-term use. Firstly, the addition of a second metal usually reduces the cost of the catalyst. Secondly, the added metal may oxidize the toxic carbon-containing intermediate into the final product adsorbed on Pd by adsorbing hydroxide ions in the alkaline medium and then release the active sites of Pd.[25,43,46–48] Finally, the prepared alloy can increase the filling degree of the antibonding orbital by changing the d-band center of Pd, thereby weakening the bonding force between Pd and the toxic carbon intermediate.[4,49–57] In spite of many environmental problems, lead remains a metal with great potential in EORs.[57,58] In this paper, we reported a simple hydrothermal method to synthesize Pd Pb alloys and compared the electrocatalytic properties of the prepared Pd Pb NNWs with different compositions by a variety of electrochemical testing methods. It can be concluded that the electrocatalytic activity of the Pd6Pb1 NNW nanocatalyst is the highest among these alloy catalysts, reaching 2344 mAmg <sup>1</sup> under alkaline conditions, which is a promising excellent electrocatalyst.

## **Results and Discussion**

Figure 1 displayed the XRD patterns of the above samples. The four dominant diffraction peaks appear at 39.1°, 45.2°, 66.1° and 79.2° in each pattern corresponding to the (111), (200), (220) and (311) facets of face-centered cubic (*fcc*) Pd phase, respectively, indicating the formation of Pd Pb nanonetwork without any other observable crystalline impurity. For four peaks of Pd Pb NNWs, the 2θ value shifts slightly because there exists Pb in the alloy compared with pure Pd and the substitution of Pb with a larger atomic radius into Pd lattice. It's seen that the peak positions of Pd8Pb1, Pd6Pb1, Pd4Pb1 and Pd3Pb1 NNWs are located between Pd (blue) and Pb (yellow) peaks, further indicating the successful synthesis of Pd Pb alloys.

The SEM images of Pd Pb NNWs (Figure 2a–d) show that the as-prepared bimetallic structures are sponge-like clusters. The morphologies of the as-prepared samples are uniform and the Pd6Pb1 NNW possesses the most regular structure, which exposes a greatly large surface area. Pd Pb NNWs may provide a lot of active sites for the electrocatalysis, thereby improving

the catalytic activity of the samples. This shows that the formation of binary PdPb alloy plays a significant effect on the morphologies of Pd-Pb NNWs with adjustable molar ratios of Pd/Pb.

TEM images (Figure 3a-d) further proved all the bimetallic Pd-Pb NNWs showed obvious network structures. It can be reasonably conjectured that the more exposed surface of nanonetworks, the more active sites of ethanol oxidation reaction are provided, which can greatly improve the catalytic activity of the prepared samples. In addition, due to the presence of a variety of bumps and stacking faults on the nanonetwork, a lot of lattice defects should be generated in the Pd<sub>6</sub>Pb<sub>1</sub> NNW. They may enhance the catalytic activity of the samples by providing a great quantity of active sites for the electrocatalysis of ethanol.

The diameters of nanowires in Pd<sub>8</sub>Pb<sub>1</sub>, Pd<sub>6</sub>Pb<sub>1</sub>, Pd<sub>4</sub>Pb<sub>1</sub> and Pd<sub>3</sub>Pb<sub>1</sub> NNWs were measured to be about 8.61, 8.30, 8.73 and 8.95 nm, respectively. HRTEM analyses (Figure 3e-h) were also applied to investigate the crystal structures of the Pd-Pb NNWs. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns of Pd<sub>8</sub>Pb<sub>1</sub>,

 $Pd_6Pb_1$ ,  $Pd_4Pb_1$  and  $Pd_3Pb_1$  NNWs in the upper right corner of Figure 3e–h exhibited continuous diffraction rings, proving that the prepared Pd–Pb NNWs have good crystallinity. And the lattice spacings in the nanonetwork structure are measured to be around 2.14, 2.30, 2.36 and 2.40 Å for  $Pd_8Pb_1$ ,  $Pd_6Pb_1$ ,  $Pd_4Pb_1$  and  $Pd_3Pb_1$  NNWs, respectively. It is clear that the lattice spacing expands slightly with the increase of Pb content. Similarly, it is reasonable to speculate that the radius of Pb atom is larger than Pd atom and Pb enters the Pd lattice and replaces part of Pd atoms so as to increase the cell size when Pb and Pd form the alloys. Therefore, the crystalline plane spacing expands along with the gradual involvement of Pb atoms.

The elemental distributions of the Pd and Pb in  $Pd_6Pb_1$  NNWs were characterized by HAADF-STEM technique, as shown in Figure 4 (where the Pd in red, Pb in green and the combined in yellow), confirming that the Pd and Pb elements distributed uniformly in  $Pd_6Pb_1$  NNW, proving the successful formation of the homogeneous alloy.

In order to better understand the subtle differences of valence structures of various Pd-Pb NNWs, the XPS technique was used. The diagrams of Pd<sub>8</sub>Pb<sub>1</sub>, Pd<sub>6</sub>Pb<sub>1</sub>, Pd<sub>4</sub>Pb<sub>1</sub> and Pd<sub>3</sub>Pb<sub>1</sub> NNWs were depicted in Figure 5 and further revealed the surface chemical composition of Pd-Pb NNWs. Figure 5a shows that the Pd 3d XPS diagram of Pd-Pb NNWs is composed of Pd (II) and Pd (0), with Pd (0) as the main component. The XPS images of Pb 4f are shown in Figure 5b and the two peaks belong to two different species. In addition, it can be clearly found that with the increase of the molar ratio of Pb/Pd in the binary Pd-Pb alloy, the binding energy (BE) of Pd 3d in the alloy moves negative first and positive later, noted that the binding energy of Pd 3d in Pd<sub>6</sub>Pb<sub>1</sub> NNW is the lowest among all Pd-Pb alloys. The shifts of binding energy in the alloys suggested that the electronic structure of Pd in the alloy has been changed. Since the electronegativity of Pb is higher than that of Pd, the d-band center of the Pd atom will change due to the transfer of electrons from Pd to Pb during the formation of the alloy, which would weaken the adsorption of toxic intermediates on the catalyst surface and thus lead to the enhancement of the activity of electrocatalytic oxidation of ethanol.  $^{[59-63]}$  In general, the introduction of lead leads to the change of electronic structure of palladium, which increases the catalytic activity of the alloy. [57]

The electrocatalytic activities of Pd-Pb NNWs were evaluated by electrochemical measurements. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of the prepared nanocatalysts and the commercial Pd/C were measured in 0.5 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> solution, as shown in Figure 6a. For Pd-Pb NNWs, there is a pair of peaks corresponding to the hydrogen adsorption process at approximately -0.3 V and hydrogen desorption process between -0.2and -0.05 V. There are two obvious peaks of Pd-Pb NNWs in two regions with large integral area. The peak of oxidation from Pd to Pd-O appears ranging from 0.3 to 0.4 V. In addition, compared with commercial Pd/C, the reduction peak potential of Pd in Pd-Pb NNWs shifts negative, indicating that the bimetallic alloy has a higher surface activity and stronger oxidation ability, which was presumably attributed to the Pd-Pb electron transfer caused by the interaction between Pd and Pb in NNWs.

The comparison of the electrocatalytic activity under alkaline conditions can be achieved by measuring the CV curves of Pd-Pb NNWs and commercial Pd/C in 1 M KOH solution (Figure 6b). The results were similar to above measurements, as shown in Figure 6a. For commercial Pd/C, the potential peak located at  $-0.9 \sim -0.8 \text{ V}$  corresponds to the peak of hydrogen desorption or adsorption and a weak peak appears at  $-0.4 \,\mathrm{V}$ , which may be due to the formation of Pd-O during forward scanning. The reduction peak of the compound appeared at a slightly higher potential of -0.3 V, indicating that Pd-0 was reduced to Pd. For Pd-Pb alloy, there is no obvious hydrogen adsorption or hydrogen desorption peak in the CV curve, confirming that the introduction of Pb can effectively inhibit hydrogen adsorption and desorption. The electrochemical activity of each Pd-Pb NNW sample can be seen more directly by measuring the electrochemically active surface areas (ECSAs) value of the oxidation peak (eq. 3-1).

$$ECSAs = Q/(m \times C) \tag{3-1}$$

where m is the loading mass of Pd on the electrode, Q is the amount of electron transfer during the reduction of Pd oxide and C is the amount of charge required for the reduction of Pd oxide, the corresponding value is  $405 \,\mu\text{C}\,\text{cm}^{-2}$ .

The ECSAs values represent the electrocatalytic activity of the catalyst material and a higher ECSA value helps to increase

the EOR activities, thereby improving the overall fuel cells performance. As depicted in Figure 6c, the ECSAs values of the  $Pd_8Pb_1$ ,  $Pd_6Pb_1$ ,  $Pd_4Pb_1$ ,  $Pd_3Pb_1$  NNWs and commercial Pd/C are calculated to be about 42.6, 50.8, 32.5, 26.3 and 11.6 m<sup>2</sup>g<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. The ECSA value of the  $Pd_6Pb_1$  NNW is the largest, 4.38 times of Pd/C counterpart.

Figure 6d shows the CV curve of Pd-Pb NNW in 1 M KOH+1 M CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>OH solution. Two distinct peaks were observed from the CV curves with different compositions. One is the forward scan of the ethanol oxidation peak in the potential range of -0.1 to 0.1 V, representing the direct oxidation of ethanol molecules. The other peak appears at  $-0.2 \,\mathrm{V}$  in the negative scan, which is related to the removal of carbonaceous intermediates caused by the incomplete oxidation of ethanol in the positive scan. The accumulation of toxic carbonaceous intermediates can lead to severe catalyst poisoning, thereby reducing the catalytic activity of Pd-Pb NNWs for EOR. It should be noted that the maximum current density of each alloy sample showed a volcanic trend with the increase of Pb content, that is, it first increased and then decreased. The peak current density of Pd<sub>6</sub>Pb<sub>1</sub> NNWs is higher than any other samples, about 3.82 times of commercial Pd/C. In addition, the onset potentials of the five samples were -0.60, -0.73, -0.75, -0.71 and -0.70 V, corresponding to Pd/C, Pd<sub>8</sub>Pb<sub>1</sub>, Pd<sub>6</sub>Pb<sub>1</sub>, Pd<sub>4</sub>Pb<sub>1</sub> and Pd<sub>3</sub>Pb<sub>1</sub> NNWs, respectively. Pd<sub>6</sub>Pb<sub>1</sub> NNW has the highest electrocatalytic activity and the most negative onset potential, indicating that Pd<sub>6</sub>Pb<sub>1</sub> NNW has the kinetic rate of promoting the electrocatalytic oxidation of ethanol in all samples.

Figure 6e compared the  $I_t/I_b$  values of Pd–Pb NNWs and commercial Pd/C, where  $I_f$  was the peak current density of binary alloy catalyst for ethanol oxidation and  $I_b$  was the peak current density corresponding to the removal of the carbonaceous intermediates. Owing to incomplete reaction, large quantities of carbonaceous intermediates generated in the electrocatalytic reaction would occupy the active sites of Pd on the alloy surface and further prevent the adsorption and oxidation of ethanol molecules, resulting in the decline of electrocatalytic performance of the catalyst. The value of  $I_t/I_b$ 

can be used to evaluate the resistance of electrocatalyst to carbonaceous intermediates. The nanocatalysts with higher  $I_t/I_b$  values possess better toxicity resistance. It can be clearly seen from Figure 6e that the  $I_t/I_b$  value of the  $Pd_3Pb_1$  NNWs is the largest, about 2.25 times than that of Pd/C. This indicated that the addition of Pb can improve the anti-toxicity through the oxidation of carbonaceous intermediates because of the adsorption of Pb to hydroxyl ions. Therefore, the  $Pd_3Pb_1$  NNW has the best anti-toxicity by reason of the maximum oxidation of carbonaceous intermediates. Comprehensive analysis shows that among the five samples prepared,  $Pd_6Pb_1$  catalyst has the best electrocatalytic activity for EOR, the highest kinetic rate of electrocatalytic oxidation of ethanol as well as the most excellent toxicity resistance.

Figure 6f revealed the Tafel plots measured for the Pd–Pb NNWs. The Tafel curves of Pd–Pb NNWs and the commercial Pd/C remain linear within the voltage range of  $-0.350 \sim -0.125$  V. The Tafel slopes of all alloy samples are lower than that of the commercial Pd/C and Pd<sub>6</sub>Pb<sub>1</sub> NNW is the lowest (259 mV dec $^{-1}$ ) among them. The interaction between Pb and electrolyte can be optimized by adding appropriate amount of Pb and generates oxygen-containing species (e.g., OH $_{\rm ads}$ ), which is conducive to the oxidation of reaction intermediates adsorbed on Pd and accelerates the charge transfer kinetics, thus promoting the electrooxidation reaction of ethanol.

To evaluate the long-term stability of Pd–Pb NNWs, the CV tests were carried out in 1 M KOH+1 M CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>OH solution for 300 cycles, as shown in Figure 7a and Figure S1a-b, which revealed that the peak current densities of all catalysts increased first and then decreased as the experiment proceeded. After the long-term cycling, the Pd–Pb alloys maintained a relatively high activity and the activity of Pd<sub>6</sub>Pb<sub>1</sub> remained 2178 mAmg<sup>-1</sup> after 300 cycles. The CV curves during cycle test can also be used to evaluate the electrocatalytic stability of the prepared catalysts. In Figure 7b, the activity of commercial Pd/C decreased rapidly, only 24.6% of its highest activity after 300 cycles, while the Pd–Pb NNWs were relatively stable and the residual activities of them were about 80% of the maximum values after 300 cycles, the Pd<sub>6</sub>Pb<sub>1</sub> NNWs still

remained 92.9% of its maximum value, especially. Figure S3 shows the SEM (a) and TEM (b) imagines of  $Pd_6Pb_1$  NNW before (a) and after (b) stability test and the atomic ratio of  $Pd_6Pb_1$  NNW before/after stability test was shown in Table S2.

The CA curves exhibited the electrocatalytic stability of Pd-Pb alloys for 5000s. As shown in Figure 8, at the beginning of the electrochemical test, a rapid decrease in all types of catalyst confirmed that carbonaceous intermediates might poison active sites of the catalysts, thus weaken the electrooxidation of ethanol. The result indicated that the current density of Pd-Pb NNWs after 5000s is larger than that of the commercial Pd/C and finally the current density remained stable in the order of  $Pd_6Pb_1 > Pd_8Pb_1 > Pd_4Pb_1 > Pd_3Pb_1 > Pd/C$ . The final activity of Pd<sub>6</sub>Pb<sub>1</sub> NNWs with the highest stability is about 870 mA mg<sup>-1</sup>, 145 times higher than that of Pd/C (about 6 mA mg<sup>-1</sup>). Comprehensive analysis shows that the electrochemical durability of Pd<sub>6</sub>Pb<sub>1</sub> is much higher than other samples, including commercial Pd/C. Therefore, Pd<sub>6</sub>Pb<sub>1</sub>, which has the best stability and highest activity, possesses the best catalytic performance and is a promising excellent EOR electrocatalyst.

As shown in Figure 9a, the electrocatalytic performance of  $Pd_6Pb_1$  NNWs in 1 M KOH + 1 M  $CH_3CH_2OH$  solution was tested under different scanning rates, indicating that the catalytic current density went up when the scanning rate increased. As the scanning rate varied from 5 mV s<sup>-1</sup> to 100 mV s<sup>-1</sup>, the peak current density value also rose from 1761 mA mg<sup>-1</sup> to 2697 mA mg<sup>-1</sup>, in the meanwhile the peak potential gradually shifted negative. Figure 9b indicates that the peak current density has a positive linear correlation with  $v^{1/2}$ , which can be concluded that the scanning rate plays a positive effect on Pd—Pb NNWs for EOR in alkaline medium.

Figure 10a showed that the peak current density of Pd<sub>6</sub>Pb<sub>1</sub> NNW increased gradually from about 2344 mA mg<sup>-1</sup> to 3702 mAmg<sup>-1</sup> when the temperature increased from 30°C to 60 °C. At even higher temperature, Pd<sub>6</sub>Pb<sub>1</sub> NNWs catalyzed EOR with higher current density in a wide voltage range. We speculate reasonably that increasing temperature may accelerate the oxidation of carbonaceous intermediates and the adsorption and oxidation of ethanol molecules by increasing the reaction speed of the rate-determining step and weakening the poisoning process of the catalyst, which improves the catalytic performance of the catalyst. A linear fitting of the relationship between the peak current density value at different temperatures and the reciprocal of temperature (1/T) was shown in the inset of Figure 10a. It is a linear curve with a negative slope, indicating that the peak current density value increases gradually with the rise of temperature.

Figure 10b shows the CV curve of  $Pd_6Pb_1$  NNWs, where the ethanol concentration is 1 M and the KOH concentration varies from 0.1 M to 1 M. As depicted in the figure, the peak current density enhanced greatly with the increase of KOH concentration. Two reasons may explain the phenomenon: first, the increase in  $OH^-$  concentration leads to the promotion in the

formation of Pb-OH<sub>ads</sub>, so that more toxic carbonaceous intermediates are oxidized, thereby releasing more Pd active sites and more ethanol molecules are adsorbed and oxidized on the metal surface, which helps to accelerate the EOR process. Second, OH<sup>-</sup> participates in every step of the oxidation of  $Pd-C_2H_5OH_{ads}$  to  $Pd-CH_3CO_{ads}$  and combines with  $Pd-OH_{ads}$  to form Pd-CH<sub>3</sub>COOH<sub>ads</sub>. This is the rate-determined step of EOR and increasing the OH<sup>-</sup> concentration in turn helps to increase the reaction speed of EOR and gain a higher peak current density. The above analysis reveals that the kinetics of Pd-Pb NNWs for ethanol oxidation should be controlled by diffusion process. The equations (eq. 3-2 to eq. 3-5) below may introduce these two reasons more clearly.

$$CH_3CH_2OH + M \rightarrow CH_3CH_2OH_{ads} - M \tag{3-2}$$

$$OH^{-} + M \rightarrow OH_{ads} - M + e^{-}$$
 (3-3)

$$CH_3CO_{ads} + OH_{ads} \rightarrow CH_3COOH (r.d.s.)$$
 (3-4)

$$CH_3COOH + OH^- \rightarrow CH_3COO^- + H_2O$$
 (3-5)

Then the concentration of CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>OH is changed under the condition of constant 1 M KOH concentration, as shown in Figure 10c. The peak current density also increased gradually with the rise of ethanol concentration. When the concentration of ethanol increases, the coverage of ethoxy groups will increase and speed up the charge transfer rate. It may speed up the oxidation reaction of ethanol because more ethanol molecules were adsorbed and oxidized on the metal surface with the increase of ethanol concentration.

The effects of KOH and ethanol concentrations on electrocatalytic performance can be observed more intuitively in Figure S2a. The relationship between current density and ethanol concentration is consistent with the above result (Figure S2b). To sum up, the electrocatalytic performance of Pd-Pb NNWs for EOR can be improved by increasing the concentration of KOH or ethanol. Figure 10d and Table S1 showed that the catalytic activity increases with the rise of temperature, concentrations of KOH and ethanol, thus promoting the ethanol oxidation reaction.

## Conclusion

Pd-Pb NNWs with different compositions were successfully synthesized by a hydrothermal method. As demonstrated by XRD, TEM, SEM and XPS analysis, the Pd-Pb alloys are composed of nanowire-based networks. The electrocatalytic activity and stability of Pd-Pb NNWs were measured by CV and CA methods and the Pd<sub>6</sub>Pb<sub>1</sub> NNW shows the best electrocatalytic performance with the peak catalytic current density of

2344 mA mg<sup>-1</sup> as well as excellent long-term stability toward EOR among all the samples. In addition, it is found that temperature, KOH and ethanol concentrations are positively correlated with the electrocatalytic activity, which provides powerful information support for exploring the available conditions of Pd—Pb alloy catalysts.

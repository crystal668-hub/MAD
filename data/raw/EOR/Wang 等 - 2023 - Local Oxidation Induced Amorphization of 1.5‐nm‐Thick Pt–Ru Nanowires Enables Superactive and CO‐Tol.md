**Low-dimensional amorphous metallic nanomaterials provide great possibility for creating high-performance electrocatalysts owing to their conspicuous reacting merits derived from the flexible coordination structures, but remain extremely challenging in synthesis. Herein, this work reports a facile synthesis of carbon-loaded amorphous 1.5-nm-thick Pt–Ru nanowires (NWs) through a local oxidation induced amorphization process. During annealing premade crystalline Pt–Ru NWs/C in air, a local-oxidation of the oxyphilic Ru generates abundant random Ru–O bonds and disturbs the order bimetallic lattices. The as-prepared amorphous Pt53Ru47 (a-Pt53Ru47) NWs/C exhibits an extremely high activity (13.7 A mg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> at 25 mV overpotential) and an excellent CO-tolerance for alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) electrocatalysis, drastically outperforming the crystalline counterpart and commercial benchmarks. Mechanism studies indicate the Pt–Ru bimetallic effects as well as the rich disordered "Pt–Ru–O" and/or "Pt–O–Ru" atomic heterojunctions can weaken the \*H binding energy and inversely strengthen the \*OH adsorption, thus promoting the alkaline HOR kinetics. More uniquely, the small interatomic spaces derived from the disordered bond nets present a H2/\*H-selected permeability, which spatially obstruct the relatively larger CO molecules to poison the internal catalytic sites during HOR. The CO-shielded internal catalytic sites and the enriched surface \*OH jointly upgrade the CO-tolerance of the a-Pt53Ru47 NWs/C catalysts.**

# **1. Introduction**

Hydrogen-oxygen fuel cells (HOFCs), as a class of promising energy conversion devices with zero-carbon emission,[1–3] show a great prospect for civil application. With the rapid development of anion exchange membrane technology,[4–6] alkaline anion exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs) are receiving dramatic attentions. Under alkaline conditions, the cathode oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) are kinetically accelerated on a richer variety of catalysts that can be composed by nonprecious elements, and endowed with improved stabilities compared to the acid scenarios.[7–10] However, the anode hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) is severely repressed in alkaline conditions even by the state-ofthe-art Pt and/or its derived electrocatalysts, presenting ≈2 orders of magnitude lower activities than that in acidic media.[11] More fatally, these catalysts tend to be poisoned by trace CO in H2 supply and deactivate rapidly.[3,12] To date, exploring efficient and durable electrocatalysts toward alkaline HOR remains pivotal for impelling the commercialization of AEMFCs.

The inferior electrocatalytic rate of alkaline HOR can be primarily attributed to the strengthened binding of adsorbed H (\*H) on Pt sites, which makes the following oxidative removal of \*H from the catalyst surfaces (i.e., the Volmer step: \*H + OH<sup>−</sup>/\*OH → H2O + e<sup>−</sup>) more difficult.[13–16] Meanwhile, the high concentration of hydroxyl groups (OH<sup>−</sup>) also play nonnegligible roles in above rate-determining step by competing with \*H to reduce the available Pt sites[17] or uncompetitively adsorbing on a secondary site to promote the oxidation of adjacent \*H.[18] Following the Sabatier principle[19] and bifunctional mechanism,[20–22] integrating Pt with more oxophilic metal species, such as Ru, Ni, and their oxides,[23–26] are emerging as a feasible method to boost alkaline HOR by virtue of optimizing both the binding energies of \*H and \*OH (HBE and OHBE). For example, Markovic et al.[27] reported the Pt0.1Ru0.9 and Ni(OH)2/Pt(111) dual-site catalysts were both more active than their single Pt counterparts. The oxophilic species nearby Pt sites can serve as auxiliary catalytic sites for OH<sup>−</sup> adsorption and thus facilitate the oxidative removal of

neighboring \*H. In the wake of these studies, crystalline Pt–Ru bimetallic alloys are considered as the benchmark HOR electrocatalysts owing to their superior performances.[20,28–29] Even so, their electrocatalytic kinetics and anti-CO poisoning capacities are still far from meeting the actual expectations. More sophisticated structural design strategies need to be further developed for Pt–Ru nanomaterials toward improving the alkaline HOR electrocatalysis in both activity and CO-tolerance.

Recently, amorphous nanomaterials have attracted increasing attentions in catalysis community due to their polytype available sites, flexible atomic-coordinations, selective permeability for light elements, improved corrosion resistance, etc.[30,31] Compared to their crystalline counterparts, these merits are instrumental in electrocatalytic reactions. If the amorphous structure further couple with ultrathin/ultrafine characteristics, an ultimate atom-utilization efficiency and greatly improved electrocatalysis capacity can be expected. For example, 1-nm-thick amorphous PtSex exhibited an electrocatalytic performance for hydrogen production rivalling that of pure noble metals, along with a high atom-utilization efficiency.[32] Amorphous PdCu nanowires (NWs) with an average thickness of ≈2.4 nm delivered a much higher mass activity in formic acid oxidation than the crystallinity counterparts.[33] However, the successful synthesis of low-dimensional amorphous alloys is always restricted by structural instability, that is, the metal atoms with non-oriented metal bonds are easy to crystallize through oriented translational motion.

In this work, we demonstrate a local oxidation induced amorphization strategy for preparation of carbon-loaded amorphous ≈1.5 nm Pt–Ru NWs (a-PtRu NWs/C) which can be applied as an excellent electrocatalyst for alkaline HOR. Though simply annealing premade crystalline Pt–Ru NWs/C (c-PtRu NWs/C) in air, the strong oxophilicity of Ru[34] arouses partial local oxidation to generate Ru–O bonds which then disturb the order bimetallic lattices, resulting in a phase-transformation from crystalline to amorphous. The glassy a-PtRu NWs/C can provide more accessible sites as well as abundant oxide/metal atomic heretojunctions[35–37] to simultaneously regulate the \*H and \*OH binding strengths and thus promote the alkaline HOR electrocatalysis. Specifically, the as-prepared a-Pt53Ru47 NWs/C delivers an ultrahigh mass activity (13.7 A mgPGM<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> at 25 mV overpotential), which attains 65- and 7-fold higher than the commercial Pt/C and PtRu/C benchmarks, respectively. More significantly, the internal catalytic sites inside the amorphous NWs are accessible for hydrogen but unreachable for CO. This selective permeability forms a physical barrier to CO and thus dramatically improves the CO-tolerance for the a-Pt53Ru47 NWs/C during alkaline HOR. This study sheds light on low-dimensional amorphous Pt-based materials for creating effective and anti-CO electrocatalysts toward alkaline HOR.

#### **2. Results and Discussions**

**Figure 1**a shows the synthetic process for the carbon-supported amorphous ultrafine Pt–Ru alloy NWs (a-Pt53Ru47 NWs/C) and the crystalline counterparts (c-Pt53Ru47 NWs/C). Typically, with platinum(II) acetylacetonate (Pt(acac)2) as the precursor, cetyltrimethyl ammonium chloride (CTAC) as the surfactant, and Mo(CO)6 as the reductant, superfine Pt NWs were initially generated as a morphology template in an oleylamine solution (Figure S1, see experimental section in Supporting Information for details). Later, 22 mg of Ru3(CO)12 was fed into the reaction solution, which then decomposed to provide zero-valent Ru atoms for further growth and then create crystalline Pt53Ru47 NWs (c-Pt53Ru47 NWs). High-angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF–STEM) images indicate, at this stage, the obtained freestanding c-Pt53Ru47 NWs are highly crystalline with a diameter around 1.5 nm (Figure 1b,c, and Figure S2, Supporting Information). From the atomic-resolution HAADF–STEM image, lattice distances of 0.224 nm belonging to the (111) plane of the face-center-cubic (fcc) phase of PtRu alloy can be distinctly measured. The corresponding energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) verifies the NWs are composed by Pt and Ru (Figure 1h). By inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS) measurements, the Pt/Ru atomic ratio is detemined to be 53:47 (Table S1, Supporting Information).

The c-Pt53Ru47 NWs were then loaded on carbon black (20 wt% of total metals on Vulcan XC-72 carbon) to form c-Pt53Ru47 NWs/C (Figure 1d,e). The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) and corresponding fast Fourier transform (FFT) pattern indicate, after loading on the carbon supports, the Pt–Ru NWs are well dispersed and still in crystalline phase. Subsequently, the c-Pt53Ru47 NWs/C was calcined at 200 °C in air for 2 h. After these treatments, the Pt–Ru NWs well maintain the 1D ultrafine feature without visible change in diameter (Figure 1f and Figure S2, Supporting Information). However, the HRTEM and corresponding FFT show no order lattice information (Figure 1g), implying the Pt–Ru NWs become glassy. This crystalline-to-amorphous transformation can be directly verified by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD). As shown in Figure 1i, the c-Pt53Ru47 NWs/C exhibits a typical fcc crystalline phase with diffraction peaks corresponding to (111), (220), and (311), while the annealed a-Pt53Ru47 NWs/C has no signal peak. Thus, the c-Pt53Ru47 NWs can be facilely transferred from crystalline to amorphous phase and generate ultrafine glassy a-Pt53Ru47 NWs simply by this heating treatment.

This annealing-induced amorphization is conflicting with conventional cognition, as a heating treatment is commonly conducive to the enhancement of crystallinity for metallic materials.[38,39] To illuminate the roots for this interesting phenomenon, we also implemented the synthetic procedure on carbon-loaded pure Pt NWs and bimetallic Pt–Ru NWs with other atomic ratios, i.e., Pt73Ru27 and Pt88Ru12 NWs (Figures S3–S5, Table S1, Supporting Information), respectively. After 200 °C annealing in air, we find this crystalline-to-amorphous transformation also occurred on Pt73Ru27 and Pt88Ru12 NWs as all the XRD diffraction peaks vanished (Figure S5, Supporting Information), while pure Pt NWs inversely exhibited an enhanced crystallinity (Figure S6, Supporting Information). These results imply that incorporation of Ru element in the bimetallic NWs is the pivotal factor leading to the amorphization process. More interestingly, if we heat these Pt–Ru bimetallic NWs in argon, they can maintain the crystallinity to a certain extent (Figure S7, Supporting Information). Based on these experimental basis, we infer that a local oxidation of the oxyphilic Ru atoms during the annealing process of the Pt–Ru NWs should contribute to this unusual amorphization phenomenon by creating new Ru–O bond and disrupting the original order metal–metal bonds.

We then conducted X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) detection to verify the above deduction and compare the composition and electronic properties between the a-Pt53Ru47 and c-Pt53Ru47 NWs/C. As shown by the wide spectra (**Figure 2**a,b), a-Pt53Ru47 NWs/C shows an obviously higher signal of O 1*s* compared to c-Pt53Ru47 NWs/C, confirming the annealing treatment can introduce more oxygen element into the NWs. The Pt 4*f* highresolution spectra show four deconvolved peaks at around 71.9, 73.5, 75.3, and 76.8 eV, which can be assigned to Pt0 4*f* 7/2, Pt2<sup>+</sup> 4*f* 7/2, Pt0 4*f* 5/2, and Pt2<sup>+</sup> 4*f* 5/2, respectively (Figure 2c). Analogously, for Ru 3*p* (Figure 2d), four deconvolved peaks located at around 462.4, 465.2, 484.7, and 487.5 eV are assigned to Ru<sup>0</sup> 3*p*3/2, Ru*<sup>x</sup>*<sup>+</sup> 3*p*3/2, Ru0 3*p*1/2, and Ru*<sup>x</sup>*<sup>+</sup> 3*p*1/2, respectively. It is worth noting that the oxidation states of Pt and Ru in a-Pt53Ru47 NWs/C are both increased significantly, in particular an obviously larger extent from 19.7% to 41.8% for more oxytropic Ru. The increased oxidized Pt states imply that the oxidation of Ru could also derive the neighboring Pt to react with oxygen to a certain extent. Therefore, the existence of Ru/Pt–Ru–O and/or Pt–O–Ru species in the a-Pt53Ru47 NWs can be speculated. These results are well in line with the O 1*s* spectra, which show the a-Pt53Ru47 NWs have a higher content of lattice oxygen than that of c-Pt53Ru47 NWs/C (51.7% versus 37.6%) (Figure 2e). Hereto, we evidentially prove that the annealing process causes a local oxidation of the bimetallic Pt–Ru NWs due to the oxytropism of Ru. With the ultrathin feature (≈1.5 nm, only about 7 atomic-layer thin), these oxygen involved species disrupt the bimetallic order lattice, arousing the amorphization of the entire Pt–Ru bimetallic NWs (Figure 2f).

X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) was then conducted on the a-Pt53Ru47 NWs/C to demystify the Ru atomic-coordination structures with Ru foil and RuO2 as references. The Ru K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra show the absorption energy of a-Pt53Ru47 NWs/C is between that of Ru foil and RuO2 (**Figure 3**a), indicating the average valent state of Ru atoms in a-Pt53Ru47 NWs/C is between 0 and +4, which is well consistent with the XPS results. The corresponding Fouriertransformed extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EX-AFS) spectra further reveal the a-Pt53Ru47 NWs/C exhibits two

major peaks centered at 1.48 and 2.65 Å, which should be respectively ascribed to Ru−O and Ru−Ru/Pt bonds according to the RuO2 and Ru foil references (Figure 3b). Notably, the peak intensity of Ru−Ru/Pt bonds in a-Pt53Ru47 NWs/C is significantly weaker than that in Ru foil, suggesting less coordination numbers for Ru−Ru/Pt in a-Pt53Ru47 NWs/C due to the rich oxidized states and its low-dimensional amorphous structure. The wavelet transforms (WTs) were further carried out to clearly show the coordination structures of Ru atoms (Figure 3c–e). The WT maximum intensities at 10.4 and 8.4 Å<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> belong to the Ru−Ru/Pt bonds for Ru foil and a-Pt53Ru47 NWs/C, respectively, while the WT maximum intensities at 6.3 and 4.7 Å<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> can be allocated to the Ru−O bonds of RuO2 and a-Pt53Ru47 NWs/C, respectively. The corresponding EXAFS fitting parameters are provided in Table S2 (Supporting Information). The lower *k* values of both the Ru−O and Ru−Ru/Pt bonds for a-Pt53Ru47 NWs/C is probably due to the locally distorted atomic structures.[40–42] The hybrid of Ru−O and Ru−Ru/Pt bonds in the a-Pt53Ru47 NWs/C can create rich oxide/metal atomic heterojunctions,[35–37] such as Ru/Pt–Ru–O and/or Pt–O–Ru species, which can provide dualfunction catalytic sites and electronically regulate the reactivity of adjacent sites.

The HOR electrocatalysis of the as-prepared a-Pt53Ru47 NWs/C catalyst was examined by a standard three-electrode system with c-Pt53Ru47 NWs/C, calcined-Pt NWs/C, commercial PtRu/C, and Pt/C as comparisons. Their cyclic voltammetry (CV) tests were first conducted in a N2-saturated 0.1 m KOH solution. For calcined-Pt NWs/C and Pt/C, the CV curves present two characteristic peaks within the hydrogen underpotential deposition (*H*upd) regions between 0.05 and 0.45 V (versus reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE) (**Figure 4**a). In contrast, the a-Pt53Ru47 NWs/C, c-Pt53Ru47 NWs/C, and PtRu/C all show distinctly lower potentials for the desorption of \*H. This result verifies that inserting Ru atoms into Pt lattice can effectively weaken the surface \*H binding energy (HBE). Figure 4b shows the HOR polarization curves recorded in an H2-saturated 0.1 m KOH solution at a rotating speed of 1600 rpm. The apparent HOR activities of a-Pt53Ru47 NWs/C, c-Pt53Ru47 NWs/C, and PtRu/C are much higher than that of calcined-Pt NWs/C and Pt/C, manifesting that PtRu alloy catalysts with weakened HBE can deliver substantially faster HOR kinetics than monometallic Pt catalysts. Their rotate rate-dependent HOR polarizations from 2500 to 625 rpm were also measured (Figures S8–S12), where the plateau current decreases with the rotating speed, indicating the electrocatalytic reaction is mainly controlled by the mass transfer of H2. Based on the Koutecky–Levich (K–L) plots constructed by the plateau currents and corresponding rotating speeds, the slopes of a-Pt53Ru47 NWs/C, c-Pt53Ru47 NWs/C, calcined-Pt NWs/C, PtRu/C, and Pt/C are calculated to be 4.72, 4.59, 4.84, 4.82, and 4.83 cm<sup>2</sup> mA<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> s<sup>−</sup>1/2, respectively, well consistent with the reported theoretical value (4.87 cm<sup>2</sup> mA<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> s<sup>−</sup>1/2).[43] To diminish the impact of mass transfer, the kinetic current densities (*j* k) were further calculated according to the K–L equation to qualitatively compare their activities. The Tafel plots of *j* <sup>k</sup> versus potential definitely demonstrate that a-Pt53Ru47 NWs/C exhibits the fastest HOR electrocatalytic kinetics, indicating the low-dimensional amorphous structure is beneficial to the alkaline HOR electrocatalysis (Figure 4c). We notice that, at 50 mV overpotential (), the apparent current density of the a-Pt53Ru47 NWs/C is already as high as approaching the plateau current (Figure 4b). As thus, to present the real kinetic activity, we chose the *j* <sup>k</sup> at = 25 mV for further calculations. After normalized with the total metal mass, a-Pt53Ru47 NWs/C exhibits an extremely high mass activity (*j* k,m = 13.7 A mgPGM<sup>−</sup>1) at = 25 mV, which is 4.1, 47.2, 7.2, and 65.2 times that of c-Pt53Ru47 NWs/C, calcined-Pt NWs/C, PtRu/C, and Pt/C, respectively (Figure 4d and Table S3, Supporting Information). Among those-prepared carbon-loaded amorphous bimetallic NW catalysts with various Pt/Ru mole ratios, the a-Pt53Ru47 NWs/C represents the highest HOR activity (Figure S13, Supporting Information). This value is even significantly superior to those of recently reported alkaline HOR catalysts derived at = 50 mV (Figure 4f and Table S4, Supporting Information). For determining the specific activities (*j* k,s) for the inspected catalysts, CO stripping tests were further conducted to calculate the electrochemically active surface areas (ECSAs) (Figure S14, Supporting Information). The ECSA values of a-Pt53Ru47 NWs/C, c-Pt53Ru47 NWs/C, calcined-Pt NWs/C, PtRu/C, and Pt/C are calculated to be 93.4, 91.4, 50.9, 72.8, and 45.3 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>−</sup>1, respectively (Table S3, Supporting Information). The corresponding ECSA-normalized kinetic current density (*j* k,s) results show that a-Pt53Ru47 NWs/C exhibits the highest specific activity (*j* k,s = 14.7 mA cmECSA<sup>−</sup>2) as expect, achieving 4.0, 24.5, 5.6, and 27.2 fold-enhancements in comparison with that of c-Pt53Ru47 NWs/C, calcined-Pt NWs/C, PtRu/C, and Pt/C, respectively (Figure 4d).

Chronoamperometry tests were subsequently conducted at = 50 mV for 6 h in H2-saturated 0.1 m KOH solution to inspect their durabilities for alkaline HOR. As shown in Figure S15 (Supporting Information), the current density of a-Pt53Ru47 NWs/C only descended by 17%, while the c-Pt53Ru47 NWs/C, PtRu/C, and Pt/C show severe 39%, 72%, and 64% deteriorations, indicating the superior alkaline HOR stability of the a-Pt53Ru47 NWs/C electrocatalysts. The increase in durability owes to the better corrosion resistance of amorphous phase NWs,[44] which can be verified by comparing the TEM images of the reacted a-Pt53Ru47 and c-Pt53Ru47NWs/C catalysts (Figure S16, Supporting Information). For anode HOR catalysts, the CO-tolerance is an important indicator for real HOFCs applications.[3,45] The CV curves of the CO stripping (Figure S14, Supporting Information) indicate the a-Pt53Ru47 NWs/C shows an relatively negative peak potential compared to other electrocatalysts, implying an improved anti-CO poisoning capacity. We further implemented chronoamperometry tests for the catalysts at = 50 mV in an H2/1000 ppm CO-saturated 0.1 m KOH solution to evaluate their long-term COtolerance during alkaline HOR electrocatalysis (Figure 4e). Impressively, the a-Pt53Ru47 NWs/C only lost 13% of initial activity after continuously testing for 2000 s, while c-Pt53Ru47 NWs/C suffered from an 80% loss, and the PtRu/C and Pt/C were even almost completely inactivated. Overall, compared to the crystalline counterpart (i.e., c-Pt53Ru47 NWs/C), the glassy a-Pt53Ru47 NWs/C possesses significantly improved alkaline HOR performances in terms of reaction kinetics, stability, and CO-tolerance.

For Pt–Ru electrocatalysts, the weakened HBE is admittedly considered as a significant factor for promoting the HOR kinetics.[46] This argument is also validated by the obvious negative potentials for \*H desorption on the CV curves for the a-Pt53Ru47 and c-Pt53Ru47 NWs/C (Figure 4a and Figure S17, Supporting Information). As clarified by the XPS and XAS characterizations, a mass of disordered "Pt–Ru–O" and/or "Pt–

O–Ru" matrixes exist in the amorphous Pt–Ru NWs. These atomically chaotic oxide/metal atomic heterojunctions can electronically regulate the reactivates of catalytic sites by accumulating partial charges from the metal atoms.  $^{[35-36,47]}$  Detailed XPS analysis shows that the Pt  $4f_{7/2}$  binding energy of a-Pt<sub>53</sub>Ru<sub>47</sub> NWs/C is 0.16 eV up-shifted compared to that of c-Pt<sub>53</sub>Ru<sub>47</sub> NWs/C (Table S5, Supporting Information). The electron-deficient Pt sites are unfavorable for the adsorption of \*H to some extent and thus weaken the HBE.  $^{[48,49]}$  On the other hand, the enriched and disordered Ru–O species are especially beneficial for the adsorption of \*OH,  $^{[50]}$  endowing enriched \*OH on the surface of a-Pt<sub>53</sub>Ru<sub>47</sub> NWs/C. As proved by the measured zeta potentials (**Figure 5**a), the values of a-Pt<sub>53</sub>Ru<sub>47</sub> NWs/C measured either in H<sub>2</sub>O or 0.1 M

KOH solutions are distinctly more negative than the c-Pt<sub>53</sub>Ru<sub>47</sub> NWs/C and the calcined-Pt NWs/C. Moreover, through the ultraviolet photoelectron spectra (UPS), the a-Pt<sub>53</sub>Ru<sub>47</sub> NWs/C shows a higher surface *d*-band center than that of c-Pt<sub>53</sub>Ru<sub>47</sub> NWs/C, implying a strengthened OHBE (Figure 5b). Following the bifunctional mechanism,  $^{[18,20,21]}$  the significantly enriched \*OH and strengthened OHBE both are favorable for the oxidative removal of the neighboring \*H and thus accelerate the Volmer step of alkaline HOR.

Beyond this, the amorphous coordination virtues should also be considered as another enhancing factor for the great elevations in both HOR activity and CO-tolerance of a-Pt<sub>53</sub>Ru<sub>47</sub> NWs/C compared to its crystalline counterpart (i.e., c-Pt<sub>53</sub>Ru<sub>47</sub> NWs/C).

An outstanding advantage of low-dimensional amorphous phases in catalysis is the permeability of interatomic spaces, resulting from the chaotic structure, to small elements. We can speculate the special ultrafine 1D amorphous nanostructure is favorable for flexible H2 diffusion or \*H spillover inside the interatomic spaces. It is interesting that the ECSA of a-Pt53Ru47 NWs/C calculated by the CV *H*upd region shows a remarkable enlargement comparted to that of c-Pt53Ru47 NWs/C (56.9 versus 47.2 m<sup>2</sup> gPGM<sup>−</sup>1, Figure 5c), indicating the interior metal sites are accessible for hydrogen. Therefore, the as-prepared a-Pt53Ru47 NWs/C can supply more active sites for \*H, which further contribute to the HOR enhancements. Understandably, molecules with a relatively larger size, such as CO, might not be able to reach the internal catalytic sites. As verified, the ECSA of a-Pt53Ru47 NWs/C determined by CO stripping only shows a slight increase compared to that of c-Pt53Ru47 NWs/C (93.4 versus 91.4 m<sup>2</sup> gPGM<sup>−</sup>1), which may be caused only by the surface disordering and roughness after amorphization. This result suggests that the interior metal sites can be shielded away from the CO molecules due to the extremely small interatomic spaces and the oversized CO molecules, as the schematic diagram illustrated (Figure S18, Supporting Information). Therefore, all through the HOR electrocatalysis, the inner active sites can avoid CO-poisoning and maintain high reactivity. As for the CO adsorbed on the superficial sites, the stronger ability of a-Pt53Ru47 NWs/C toward adsorbing OH species is also conducive for their oxidation and removal from the surface.[12,51,52] Therefore, the successful isolation of internal catalytic sites away from CO and the enriched surface \*OH bindings drastically improve the anti-CO poisoning ability of the a-Pt53Ru47 NWs/C catalysts. Figure 5d schematically presents the evolutionary merits from crystalline Pt NWs to crystalline Pt–Ru NWs and to amorphous Pt–Ru NWs for alkaline HOR. In short, the local oxidation induced amorphization of the ultrafine Pt–Ru NWs endows the catalysts a series of advantages, including weakened HBE, enriched \*OH, amplified accessible catalytic sites, H2/\*H-selected permeability, and CO-shielded interior sites, which work together to achieve the outstanding HOR activity and excellent CO-tolerance in alkaline media.

# **3. Conclusions**

In summary, we demonstrate the preparation of carbon-loaded amorphous ≈1.5 nm Pt–Ru NWs through a local oxidation induced amorphization process. For alkaline HOR electrocatalysis, the as-prepared amorphous a-Pt53Ru47 NWs/C delivers extremely high activity (13.7 A mgPGM<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> at = 25 mV) and outstanding CO-tolerance, substantially outperforming the crystalline counterpart and the Pt/C and PtRu/C benchmarks. Our mechanism studies indicate the bimetallic alloy effects and the electronic effects derived by the disordered "Pt–Ru–O" and/or "Pt–O–Ru" atomic heterojunctions can simultaneously regulate the \*H and \*OH binding strengths and thus promote the alkaline HOR electrocatalysis. More significantly, the extremely small interatomic spaces between the internal catalytic sites are only available for H2 diffusion and/or \*H spillover, which can amplify the quantity of accessible catalytic sites and concurrently obstruct CO molecules to poison the internal catalytic sites during HOR. The novel isolation effect of internal catalytic sites to CO and the enriched surface \*OH bindings substantially improve the COtolerance of the a-Pt53Ru47 NWs/C catalysts. This work lights up the structural merits of low-dimensional amorphous nanomaterials in electrocatalysis and provides an innovative strategy for creating highly active and durable electrocatalysts toward alkaline HOR.

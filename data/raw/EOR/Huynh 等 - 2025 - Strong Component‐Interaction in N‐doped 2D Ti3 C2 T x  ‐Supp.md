occurs a dual-path mechanism including the incomplete oxidation (i.e., C2 pathway) to produce acetaldehyde and/or acetic acid through transferring 2- and/or 4-electrons without the C─C bond cleavage, and the complete oxidation mechanism (i.e., C1 pathway) via the 12-electron transferring with the breaking of C─C bonds to generate of CO2, and the "C1" pathway is an ideal reaction to improve the working efficiency and long-term life of DEFCs.[\[1a,b,2\]](#page-8-0) At this juncture, platinum (Pt) is the state-of-the-art anodic electrocatalyst, but its unfulfilling C─C bond breaking and strong EOR intermediate adsorption induces sluggish reaction kinetic and thus significantly degrades the EOR efficiency during longterm operating conditions;[\[1b,2,3\]](#page-8-0) therefore, designing EOR catalysts with a favorable C1 pathway and great anti-CO poisoning is crucial for commercializing DEFCs.

In addition to the poor C1 pathway selectivity, a weak interaction between Pt NPs and conventional carbon support also induces the detachment/dissolution and Ostwald ripening of Pt NPs under acidic and oxidative environments, decreasing the overall DEFC performance.[\[4\]](#page-8-0) Recently, the development of robust catalyst supports with excellent conductivity is considered an efficient but facile strategy to boost the EOR efficiency of Pt-based electrocatalysts.[\[2a,3b\]](#page-8-0) Of the multitude of 2D materials available, 2D transition-metal carbides and nitrides (MXenes) are emerging as promising substrates for electrochemical reactions due to their unique layered structure, superior electrical conductivity, hydrophilic nature, and tunable energy band, which facilitates the deposition of metal loading and accelerates the electrocatalytic performance.[\[5\]](#page-8-0) Despite the achievements, 2D MXene flakes tend to be restacked by the van-der-Waals forces and hydrogen bonding, significantly lowering active sites and limiting the ion/mass transfer pathway and, consequently, reducing the electrocatalytic performance for their particular energy-related conversion applications.[\[6\]](#page-8-0) Inspired by the element doping engineering of graphene,[\[7\]](#page-8-0) we fabricated an N-doped 2D Ti3C2T*<sup>x</sup>* MXenes via an NH3-assisted hydrothermal route as an acidic hydrogen evolution electrocatalyst.[\[8\]](#page-8-0) The enhanced performance was assigned to the modified electronic structure and synergistic contributions of nitrogen-related species in 2D MXenes, boosting the ion diffusion and charge transfer during the electrochemical process.

the advantages of N-doped MXenes for Pd-based electrocatalysts for the alkaline EOR,  $^{[3b,5a,6d]}$  but how N-doped Ti $_3$ C $_2$ T $_x$  affects the overall electrocatalytic performance of Pt NPs for the acidic EOR process is still lacking, which needs to be systemically explored to provide more understanding in the potential of MXene-based materials for energy-related conversion and storage technologies.

Based on these considerations, we herein anchor Pt NPs on the surface and interlayer N-doped 2D  $\mathrm{Ti_3C_2T_x}$  MXene nanosheets via the NaBH<sub>4</sub>-assisted ethylene glycol reduction route. The nitrogen addition not only increases the interlayer spacing between MXenes for facilitating the ion transfer and accessibility between electrocatalyst surface and reactants/intermediates but also forms the robust interplay between N-doped  $\mathrm{Ti_3C_2T_x}$  and Pt NPs, modifying the electron structure of Pt NPs and thus enhance-

ing the  $C_1$  pathway selectivity for the EOR process. Originating from these advantages, the as-made Pt/N-Ti $_3$ C $_2$ T $_x$  catalyst shows increased EOR performance with 435.35 mA mg $_{\rm Pt}^{-1}$  mass activity and 0.83 mA cm $^{-2}$  specific activity, being larger than those of the Pt/C (E-TEK). Furthermore, the as-made Pt/N-Ti $_3$ C $_2$ T $_x$  catalyst exhibits superior CO-tolerance and EOR stability after 3600 s testing.

#### 2. Results and Discussion

The Pt/N-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> catalyst was fabricated via the two-step route, including the selective etching and NH<sub>3</sub>-assisted hydrothermal method (160 °C, 12 h) to achieve N-doped Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> MXene, [8] followed by the NaBH<sub>4</sub>-assisted ethylene glycol reduction route to

grow and uniformly disperse Pt NPs on the N-doped Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> surface by the formation of Na<sup>+</sup>B<sup>-</sup>(OCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>OH) complex as both a reducing agent and stabilizer.[9] The structural information of the as-made catalyst was achieved through X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns. As illustrated in Figure 1a, aside from typical diffraction peaks of 2D MXene structure, the XRD pattern of the Pt/N-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> electrocatalyst displayed three featured diffraction peaks at 39.96° (111), 46.48° (200), and 67.69° (220), being slightly shifted to higher angles compared to those of face-centered-cubic Pt structure (JCPDS 04-0802) because of the synergistic effect between metal NPs and catalyst support. [10] Notably, the (002) facet of N-doped Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> MXene was negatively shifted from 7.15° to 6.61°, suggesting an increment in the MXene interlayer spacing from 1.24 nm to 1.34 nm after the anchoring of Pt NPs. This demonstrated that Pt NPs were formed at the surface and interlayer of N-doped Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub>, accelerating the ion diffusion route in Pt/N-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> catalyst during electrochemical reactions.<sup>[8,11]</sup> In addition to XRD patterns, the attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) was used to probe the surface chemistry of the Pt/N-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> catalyst. Apart from vibration peaks of 2D Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> MXenes, the ATR-FTIR spectrum of N-doped Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> and Pt/N-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> in Figure 1b described a broak adsorption peak at ≈1500 cm<sup>-1</sup> because of the symmetry C—C cleavage in the 2D Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> matrix by substituting of carbon

with nitrogen atoms. [12] Furthermore, adsorption peaks in the ATR-FTIR spectra of Pt/N-Ti $_3$ C $_2$ T $_x$  was decreased and negatively shifted compared to the N-doped Ti $_3$ C $_2$ T $_x$ , which was assigned to the interplay between Pt NPs and nitrogen-doped Ti $_3$ C $_2$ T $_x$ , being in line with the XRD pattern.

To gain more insights into the synergistic interaction in Pt/N-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> electrocatalyst, the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was conducted. As illustrated in Figure 1c, the XPS survey spectra of the Pt/N-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> catalyst revealed several elemental signals consisting of Pt 4f, C 1s, N 1s, Ti 2p, O 1s, and F 1s. Based on the broad XPS spectrum, the calculated nitrogen content in N-doped Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> and Pt/N-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> materials was 2.55 and 2.32 at%, respectively, and the slightly decreased nitrogen concentration in Pt/N-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> was attributable to the removal of N-containing terminations on the 2D Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> surface after the reduction process of Pt, being further confirmed by the N 1s XPS spectra. The deconvoluted C 1s XPS spectra in Figure 1d exhibited five distinct peaks at binding energies of 281.78, 284.54, 285.46, 286.49, and 289.18 eV of C-Ti, C-C, C-N, C-O, and C=O, respectively.[13] The Ti 2p XPS spectra in Figure 1e was deconvoluted into multiple peaks at binding energies of 454.98 (460.65), 455.50 (461.43), 456.47 (462.39), 457.24 (463.36), 459.05 (464.90) of Ti-C, Ti<sup>2+</sup>, Ti<sup>3+</sup>, Ti-N, and Ti-F species, respectively.<sup>[14]</sup> In addition, the deconvoluted N 1s XPS spectrum in Figure 1f

described the coexistence of different bond types consisting of N–I (chemisorbed  $\gamma$ -N<sub>2</sub> species) at 399.03 eV, N-II (O–Ti–N, Ti-O-N, and/or Ti-N-O) at 400.83 eV, and Ti-N species at 395.68 eV,<sup>[15]</sup> indicating the nitrogen doping into 2D Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> MXenes at different positions, including lattice and functional substitution, and surface absorption.<sup>[8,16]</sup> In terms of the Pt element, high-resolution Pt 4f XPS spectra in Figure 1g was deconvoluted into the  $Pt^0$  state (71.33 eV for Pt  $4f_{7/2}$  and 74.62 eV for Pt  $4f_{5/2}$ ) and Pt<sup>2+</sup> state (72.36 eV for Pt  $4f_{7/2}$  and 75.81 eV for Pt  $4f_{5/2}$ ), and the presence of Pt<sup>2+</sup> state was due to the surface oxidation process of Pt in the ambient condition and/or residual precursors. Based on the area ratio of all split peaks, the Pt° content in the Pt/N-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> catalyst was calculated to be 69.58%, indicating that the metallic Pt was the main chemical state in the Pt/N-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> catalyst. Notably, Pt 4f binding energies in the Pt/N-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> catalyst were positively shifted compared to other catalysts (i.e., Pt/Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub>, Pt/C), suggesting the strong interaction between Pt NPs and N-doped Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub>. This resulted in the off-centering of the d-band center of Pt NPs in Pt/N-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> electrocatalyst, thereby weakening the chemisorption of CO<sub>ads</sub> intermediates and increasing the electrocatalytic performance for oxidizing small organic molecules. [10,17] The morphology and elemental distribution of the Pt/N-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> electrocatalyst were determined through transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution-TEM (HR-TEM) images. TEM images in Figure 2a,b reveal the overlapping accumulations and agglomerations of Pt NPs having a size diameter in the range of 3-5 nm, being recorded by calculating 50 NPs in the TEM image (inset in Figure 2b). The HR-TEM image in Figure 2c showed distinct lattice fringes consisting of 0.22, 0.2, and 1.05 nm of Pt(111), N-Ti $_3$ C $_2$ T $_x$ (101), and N-Ti $_3$ C $_2$ T $_x$ (002) planes, respectively,[18] demonstrating the anchoring of Pt NPs on the

N-doped 2D Ti3C2T*<sup>x</sup>* support. Additionally, the EDX-elemental mapping image described the presence of Ti, C, N, and Pt with the Pt content of 16 wt.% (Figure [2d,e\)](#page-2-0). In general, the above outcomes suggested the successful deposition of Pt NPs on N-doped 2D Ti3C2T*<sup>x</sup>* substrate by the NaBH4-assisted ethylene glycol reduction method.

The electrochemical behaviors of Pt/N-Ti3C2T*<sup>x</sup>* were assessed by the EOR process. As illustrated in **Figure 3**[a,](#page-3-0) cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of all studied EOR catalysts described typical voltammetric features of Pt-based materials in the acidic electrolyte with a hydrogen adsorption/desorption region in the 0.0–0.4 VRHE range, and an oxidation/reduction region of Pt in the 0.8–1.0 VRHE range. Based on the hydrogen adsorption/desorption features, the electrochemical surface area (ECSA) was estimated to be 52.33, 43.25, and 73.38 m<sup>2</sup> gPt<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> for Pt/N-Ti3C2T*x*, Pt/Ti3C2T*x*, and Pt/C (E-TEK), respectively. The lower ECSA value of the as-made electrocatalyst was assigned to a decrease in the Pt content in Pt/N-Ti3C2T*x*. Analogously, all studied catalysts exhibited typical voltammetric curves of Pt-related catalysts in the acidic ethanol media with a typical peak at 0.8 VRHE of the EOR process in the positive-going sweep, and the EOR potential of Pt/N-Ti3C2T*<sup>x</sup>* was much lower than the Pt/C (E-TEK), demonstrating that the EOR was faster and easier on the as-obtained Pt/N-Ti3C2T*<sup>x</sup>* catalyst (Figure [3b\)](#page-3-0). Another peak at 0.5 VRHE in the negative-going scan presents the removal process of intermediate species from the forward scan, and the forward peak/reverse peak current ratio (I*<sup>f</sup>* /Ib) is usually used to assess the tolerance ability to carbonaceous species of catalysts for the anodic oxidation reaction.[\[19\]](#page-9-0) The I*<sup>f</sup>* /Ib ratio of Pt/N-Ti3C2T*x*, Pt/Ti3C2T*x*, and Pt/C (E-TEK) catalyst corresponded to 1.11, 0.83,

and 0.72, suggesting the enhanced carbonaceous poisoning resistance of the Pt/N-Ti $_3$ C $_2$ T $_x$ . Additionally, the calculated mass activity and specific activity of Pt/N-Ti $_3$ C $_2$ T $_x$  were 435.35 mA mg $_{\rm Pt}^{-1}$  and 0.83 mA cm $^{-2}$ , respectively, being greater than those of Pt/Ti $_3$ C $_2$ T $_x$  (225.42 mA mg $_{\rm Pt}^{-1}$  and 0.52 mA cm $^{-2}$ ), and Pt/C (346.21 mA mg $_{\rm Pt}^{-1}$  and 0.47 mA cm $^{-2}$ ). These values described the synergistic effects of N-doped 2D Ti $_3$ C $_2$ T $_x$  MXene on the EOR activity of Pt/N-Ti $_3$ C $_2$ T $_x$  (Figure 3c); while the lower OER performance of Pt/Ti $_3$ C $_2$ T $_x$  catalyst was attributable to the restacking of 2D Mxene flakes by the van-der-Waals forces, significantly lowering surface-active sites and limiting the ion/mass transfer pathway during the OER process, similar to what reports in previous studies. Moreover, the EOR activity of Pt/N-Ti $_3$ C $_2$ T $_x$  was comparable/superior to other Pt NPs loaded on different supports (Figure 3d and Table S1, Supporting Information).

To further assess the EOR properties of the Pt/N-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> catalyst, linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) measurement was conducted in the acidic ethanol environment. As shown in **Figure 4a**, the Pt/N-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> electrocatalyst had a smaller EOR onset potential than the Pt/Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> and Pt/C (E-TEK) electrocatalysts. Figure S1 (Supporting Information) shows the effects of Pt loading on the overall EOR activity of as-made Pt/N-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> electrocatalysts; in detail, the EOR current significantly enhanced with increasing the Pt loading from 12 to 16 wt.%, while the negligible EOR activity was observed at 20 wt.% Pt/N-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub>, demonstrating the 16 wt.% Pt/N-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> catalyst was optimal among all studied Pt/N-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> materials by a balance between the EOR performance and Pt content. In addition, the Tafel slope was used to reflect the EOR mechanism, and the smaller the Tafel slope, the faster the reaction kinetic.

Several kinetic parameters (i.e., exchange current ( $j_0$ ), and charge transfer coefficient ( $\alpha$ )) were also calculated from the Tafel equation to shed light on the boosted EOR activity of the Pt/N-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> catalyst. As shown in Figure 4c and Table S3 (Supporting Information), the  $j_0$  and  $\alpha$  values of Pt/N-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> catalyst were 0.011 mA and 0.21, being higher than those of Pt/Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> (0.0038 mA, 0.17) and commercial Pt/C (0.0043 mA, 0.19), strongly signifying the enhanced EOR kinetic of Pt/N-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub>, matching with the CV and LSV tests. Derivative voltammogram describes the change rate of voltammetric current (i) to potential (E, di/dE) to achieve more useful voltammetric features than conventional voltammograms.<sup>[21]</sup> In detail,

at the low-potential range from 0.0 to 0.4  $V_{RHE}$ , aside from the ethanol dissociative adsorption process, another parallel process can also be carried out to produce acetyl and acetate and, subsequently, CO and  $CH_x$  species.<sup>[21c,22]</sup> In the 0.4–0.8  $V_{RHE}$  range, water molecules are dissociated and the presence of co-catalysts can generate active oxygen species at a lower potential than pure Pt,<sup>[21c,23]</sup> resulting in the fast growth of derivative current because of the oxidation of CO and  $CH_x$  intermediates to  $CO_2$  at  $\approx$ 0.8  $V_{RHE}$  (peak II), which can be the rate-determining step for all EOR catalysts. At the above 0.8  $V_{RHE}$ , the oxidation process on Pt occurs and forms surface oxides, blocking the ethanol adsorption and its subsequent oxidation process, thereby dropping the derivative current value at  $\approx$ 0.9  $V_{RHE}$ . <sup>[1c,21c]</sup> The derivative current increases again at >1.0  $V_{RHE}$  by the oxidation of previously adsorbed species onto the catalyst surface. <sup>[21c]</sup> Another

peak ≈0.5 VRHE (peak I) represents the EOR via the C─C bond breaking, and the absence of this peak suggests the EOR process on electrocatalysts via the C2 pathway mechanism without the C─C bond breaking.[\[1c\]](#page-8-0) As shown in Figure [4d,](#page-4-0) the as-made Pt/N-Ti3C2T*<sup>x</sup>* catalyst showed a much higher peak I than other studied EOR catalysts (i.e., Pt/Ti3C2T*<sup>x</sup>* and Pt/C), demonstrating the selective C─C bond breaking on the Pt/N-Ti3C2T*<sup>x</sup>* catalyst compared to other studied EOR electrocatalysts. This enhanced selectivity was attributable to more electron transfer from Pt NPs to N-doped Ti3C2T*<sup>x</sup>* by the nitrogen addition, being strongly evidenced by XPS results, resulting in the modification of d-band center Pt and thus facilitating the C─C bond cleavage and the C1-intermediate desorption process.[\[1c,2a,24\]](#page-8-0)

To shed light on the enhanced EOR performance of the asmade Pt/N-Ti3C2T*<sup>x</sup>* catalyst, the mass transfer influence was determined through the effect of scan rate on the EOR current. Aside from the improved current, the EOR potential was gradually shifted to a larger potential with increasing scan rates (**Figure 5**[a–c\)](#page-5-0), indicating that the EOR on all studied electrocatalysts was an irreversible process.[\[9b\]](#page-8-0) Figure [5d](#page-5-0) shows a linear correlation between the current and the square root scan rate, suggesting the dominance of a diffusion-controlled process.[\[25\]](#page-9-0) The slope value from this linear relationship reflected the electron numbers transferred in the rate-determining step.[\[25\]](#page-9-0) The slope value of Pt/N-Ti3C2T*<sup>x</sup>* was 0.17, which was 1.89-time higher than 0.09 for the Pt/C, indicating the increased mass transfer rate and EOR kinetic, being in line with LSV tests. In addition, the EOR thermodynamic behavior of as-made Pt/N-Ti3C2T*<sup>x</sup>* was investigated by the LSV test at different temperatures (**Figure 6**[a–c\)](#page-6-0). The apparent activation energy was estimated by the Arrhenius equation, reflecting the adsorption energy of reactants and intermediates on electrocatalysts. The smaller the apparent activation energy, the easier and faster the EOR process.[[26\]](#page-9-0) Figure [6d](#page-6-0) described that the apparent activation energy of the Pt/N-Ti3C2T*<sup>x</sup>* was 39.19 kJ mol<sup>−</sup>1, being much lower than 50.99 kJ mol<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> of the commercial carbon-supported Pt NPs, strongly confirming the boosted EOR activity of the Pt/N-Ti3C2T*<sup>x</sup>* catalyst.

The CO-tolerance ability of all studied EOR electrocatalysts was also tested through the CO-stripping test to further evidence the enhanced performance of the Pt/N-Ti3C2T*<sup>x</sup>* catalyst. **Figure 7**a demonstrates the absence of hydrogen adsorption/desorption regions in all CO-stripping curves of electrocatalysts, being attributable to the CO adsorption on the electrocatalyst surface, followed by the COads oxidation peak at ≈0.9 VRHE. The as-made Pt/N-Ti3C2T*<sup>x</sup>* catalyst showed a low COads-oxidation onset potential of 0.68 VRHE, being negatively shifted by 150 mVRHE compared to the commercial EOR catalyst, indicating the easier COads oxidation on Pt/N-Ti3C2T*<sup>x</sup>* catalyst. The effective removal of COads not only accelerated the dehydrogenation ratio of ethanol molecules but also attenuated the performance deterioration by COads poisoning in real electrochemical applications.[\[9b,27\]](#page-8-0) In addition to the CO-stripping measurement, the CA test was also conducted to consider the long-term electrocatalytic stability of catalysts. As shown in Figure 7b, chronoamperometry (CA) curves of all studied EOR catalysts showed the time-dependent decay of the EOR activity by the accumulation of carbonaceous intermediates from the oxidation of ethanol molecules, resulting in the lowered concentration gradient at the electrolyte-electrode interface under the unperturbed condition.[\[9b,28\]](#page-8-0) After the CA test, the Pt/N-Ti3C2T*<sup>x</sup>* maintained the highest current density among all studied EOR catalysts, suggesting the Pt/N-Ti3C2T*<sup>x</sup>* had great electrochemical stability and high CO-tolerance ability, matching with the CO-stripping results. In brevity, the above electrochemical outcomes indicate that the anchoring Pt NPs on N-doped Ti3C2T*<sup>x</sup>* MXene can be a potential electrocatalyst to substitute the commercially available Pt/C (E-TEK) catalyst for the acidic EOR process, originating from some aspects: i) aside from the unique structure of 2D MXenes, the introduction of nitrogen atoms not only accelerates the ion diffusion and charge transfer rate by increasing MXene distance, which is strongly confirmed by XRD, LSV, and Tafel plots, and ii) the strong component interaction in as-made Pt/N-Ti3C2T*<sup>x</sup>* electrocatalyst weakens the adsorption strength of carbonaceous species and improve the selective C─C bond breaking, thereby boosting reaction kinetics and CO-tolerance of the as-made Pt/N-Ti3C2T*<sup>x</sup>* catalyst, being evidenced by XPS, Arrhenius plots, derivative voltammograms and CO-stripping results.

# **3. Conclusion**

In summary, we develop a Pt/N-Ti3C2T*<sup>x</sup>* hybrid material with strong component interaction by the one-step NaBH4-assisted

<span id="page-8-0"></span>ethylene glycol reduction method that serves as the potential EOR catalyst. The Pt/N-Ti3C2T*<sup>x</sup>* electrocatalyst enhances the C─C bond cleavage and CO-tolerance compared to the commercial catalysts for the acidic EOR process, thereby increasing the EOR performance with 435.35 mA mgPt<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> and 0.83 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> specific activity, along with high electrocatalytic stability. The improvement is assigned to the advantages of unique 2D structure and strong interaction between Pt NPs and N-doped Ti3C2T*<sup>x</sup>* substrate. This work demonstrates that doping MXenes with heteroatoms is an effective strategy to increase the electrocatalytic efficiency of Pt-based materials for oxidizing small organic molecules in energy-related conversion technologies.

### **4. Experimental Section**

The Pt/N-Ti3C2T*<sup>x</sup>* hybrid electrocatalyst was prepared by the NaBH4 assisted ethylene glycol reduction method.[9] First, 2.5 mL of H2PtCl6 (0.05 m) was added in 30 mL of ethylene glycol and water, followed by adding 0.1 g of N-doped 2D Ti3C2T*<sup>x</sup>* flakes under ultrasonication for 30 min at 25 °C. After adjusting pH to 11, 5 mL of NaBH4 (0.05 m) was dripped into the above suspension under stirring for 120 min at roomtemperature to reduce the PtCl6 <sup>2</sup><sup>−</sup> thoroughly to Pt NPs. The resulting product was achieved by washing with deionized water and then drying at 80 °C for analysis. More information on physical characterizations and electrochemical tests was shown in the Supporting Information.

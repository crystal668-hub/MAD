## **Abstract**

Outer membrane proteins (Omps) of Gram‐negative bacteria have been proven to be efficient subunit vaccines against bacteriosis. In this study, OmpF and OmpK of *Aeromonas hydrophila* were expressed, and their immune protective effects in European eel (*Anguilla anguilla*) were evaluated. The genomic DNA of *A. hydrophila* 322A was used as a template, and two kinds of prokaryotic expression plasmids, pET‐32a‐OmpF and pET‐32a‐OmpK, were constructed. Recombinant OmpF pro‐ tein (r‐OmpF) and r‐OmpK were purified and were proven to have antigenicity by Western‐blot analysis. r‐OmpF and r‐OmpK were used as immunogens to immunize European eel by intraperitoneal injection. The mRNA expression of 6 immune‐related genes (*IgM*, *IL‐10*, *IRF3*, *IRF7*, *LysG4* and *HexB*) in the liver tissues of eels at 1 hr, 3 hr, 6 hr, 12 hr, 24 hr, 72 hr and 10 days postimmunization was analysed by real‐time PCR. At 30 dpi, the serum antibody response was measured by ELISA. Fish were attacked at 15 dpi by live 322A to assess the protective immunity of r‐OmpF and r‐OmpK. All the six tested genes responded to r‐OmpF or r‐OmpK vaccination at varying degrees. The serum antibody titre of r‐OmpF‐ and r‐OmpK‐immunized groups was 1:1,600 and 1:3,200 respectively. In addition, r‐OmpF gave 35.5% of the relative immune pro‐ tection rate to European eels, while r‐OmpK gave 70.0%. By analysing the protective immunity and the regulatory role in the immune‐related gene expression of the two recombinant proteins that were studied, it was found that r‐OmpK was a potential vaccine candidate against *A. hydrophila*.

## **1** | **INTRODUCTION**

*Aeromonas hydrophila*, which is a major Gram‐negative bacterial pathogen in aquaculture, is responsible for many infectious dis‐ eases such as hemorrhagic septicaemia, hemorrhagic enteritis, ab‐ dominal dropsy, epizootic ulcerative syndrome, exophthalmos and red body disease (Dash, Sahoo, Gupta, Garg, & Dixit, 2014; Fang, Ge, & Sin, 2004). The pathogen could infect a variety of fish, includ‐ ing carp (Mohanty, Mishra, Das, Jena, & Sahoo, 2008), channel cat‐ fish (Peatman et al., 2018), golden fish (Maji, Mali, & Joardar, 2006) and eel (Esteve & Alcaide, 2009), which results in huge economic losses to aquaculture industry around the world. The application of antibiotics is presently not preferred, due to unavoidable drug resistance and side effects to the environment and human beings

(Karunasagar, Pai, Malathi & Karunasagar, 1994). Vaccination re‐ mains to be an alternative and effective strategy to protect fish against Aeromonasis. Currently, whole‐cell vaccines (Chandran, Aruna, Logambal, & Michael, 2002), live‐inactivated vaccines (Leung, Wong, Low, & Sin, 1997), biofilm vaccines (Azad, Shankar, Mohan, & Kalita, 1999), and S‐layer protein vaccines (Poobalane et al., 2010) are all candidates against this bacterial infection at the laboratory scale. However, there is still not an effective commer‐ cial vaccine in aquaculture industry due to the antigenic diversity of *A. hydrophila*.

Outer membrane proteins (Omps), which are exposed on the sur‐ face of Gram‐negative bacteria, have been proven to play an import‐ ant role in the survival and multiplication of bacteria in a host system (Lin, Huang, & Zhang, 2002). Furthermore, they are well‐known due to their highly antigenicity and could stimulate the specific immune system of host (Elis & Kunhe, 2010). Several recombinant Omps of *A. hydrophila* have been reported to be potential vaccine candidates against the bacterial infection. A variable upregulation of several immune‐related genes were reported in rohu (*Labeo rohita*) at early time points postimmunization with recombinant OmpR, along with an increase in serum parameters and a significantly reduced per‐ cent mortality against *A. hydrophila* challenge (Dash et al., 2014). Recombinant OmpW protein induced an increasing antibody pro‐ duction and a higher relative percentage survival in common carp (*Cyprinus carpio*) when compared to the control fish (Maiti, Shetty, Shekar, Karunasagar & Karunasagar, 2012). Recombinant OmpG and Omp46 also showed immunogenicity in European eel (*Anguilla anguilla*) in eliciting significantly increased specific antibodies, and providing higher protection efficiencies for the pathogen challenge (Feng et al., 2017; Guan, Xiong, Huang, & Guo, 2011). Chinese bream (*Megalobrama amblycephala*) showed a significant increase in serum IgM levels and a protective response to the *A. hydrophila* challenge after vaccination with the recombinant Omp38 protein (Wang, Yang, Zang, Liu, & Lu, 2013).

However, there is no systematic screening and comparison of specific Omps of *A. hydrophila.* In our previous study, four specific Omps (molecular weight of 28, 37, 43 and 45 kD) of *A. hydrophila* 322A were detected with both the European eel (*A. anguilla*) antisera against the whole cells of 322A and rabbit antisera against the Omps of 322A. Among these 4 Omps, 37 kD protein (the highest expres‐ sion levels) and 28 kD protein (the common one among five different strains of genus *Aeromonas*) were identified as OmpF and OmpK by MALDI‐TOF‐TOF MS respectively (Liao, 2015). Therefore, the pres‐ ent study was undertaken to express recombinant OmpF and OmpK of *A. hydrophila* and to evaluate their immunogenic potential as vac‐ cine candidates in European eel (*A. anguilla*).

## **2** | **MATERIALS AND METHODS**

## **2.1** | **Bacterial strains**

A pathogenic strain *A. hydrophila* 322A, which was isolated from dermal ulcer of Japanese eel (*Anguilla japonica*) with lesions of liver during an outbreak in Fuqing, Fuzhou city, China (Zhang, Zhu, Chen, Mei, & Lin, 2010), was used for cloning and the recombinant expres‐ sion of OmpF and OmpK, and for a challenging experiment. The *Escherichia coli* BL21 (DE3) strain (Invitrogen, USA) was used as host for cloning and the recombinant expression study. Both *A. hydrophila* and *E. coli* were grown in Luria Bertani (LB) (Sigma, USA) broth and/ or agar plate, and *A. hydrophila* was incubated at 28°C and *E. coli* at 37°C.

## **2.2** | **Fish**

Two hundred European eel (apparently healthy without prior history of any infection, average weight 100 ± 12 g) were ob‐ tained from an eel farm located in Fuzhou, China. After 7 days of temporary rearing, the fish were randomly divided into four groups of 50 each in fibre‐reinforced plastic tanks of 800 L capacity in an automatic circulating water system. After im‐ munization, a separate group of eels (36) were used for the preparation of the European eel antisera against the Omps of *A. hydrophila* 322A and were fed in another 4 tanks of 100 L ca‐ pacity (9 eels per tank). All the tanks were provided adequate aeration. The water temperature in tanks was set to 20°C dur‐ ing the experimental period. Fish were fed with commercial feed (Fuqing Tianma Feed Co., Ltd. in Fujian province, China) at 1% body weight.

During the handling of fish for any injection procedure, MS222 (Sigma, USA) was used as an anaesthetic agent and was also used in an overdose to sacrifice the fish for tissue collection.

# **2.3** | **Cloning and sequencing of OmpF and OmpK genes from** *Aeromonas hydrophila*

Genomic DNA of *A. hydrophila* 322A was extracted follow‐ ing the method of the kit (Invitrogen, USA). The nucleo‐ tide sequences of OmpF and OmpK were retrieved from the GenBank and primers were designed as follows: OmpF‐F: 5′‐ CGGGATCCGTGGTTTATGACAAAGACGGTACC‐3′, OmpF‐R: 5′‐ CCCTCGAG T TAGA AGT TGTAT TGCAGGGCA AC‐3′, containing the *Bam*HI and *Xho*I restriction en‐ zyme sites (underlined), respectively; and OmpK‐F: 5′‐CGGAATTCATGGCCAAATTTACCAAGACTC‐3′, OmpK‐R: 5′‐CCCTCGAGTTAGAACTTGTAGGTCACGGAG‐3′, with the *Eco*RI and *Xho*I restriction enzyme sites (underlined) respectively. PCR was carried out in a 25 μl PCR mixture consisting of premix Taq 12.5 μl (Takara, China), 200 μM dNTP (Takara, China), 12.5 pmol of each primer (Sangon, China) and 100 ng of template DNA. PCR amplification was performed in a programmable thermocycler (Bio‐Rad, USA), which included an initial delay at 95°C for 3 min followed by 34 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 30 s, annealing at 55°C for 60 s, extension at 72°C for 90 s and a final delay at 72°C for 10 min. PCR products were subjected to electrophore‐ sis in 1% agarose gel, stained with Goodview nucleic acid stain (Takara, China), and sequenced by Sangon (China).

# **2.4** | **Expression, purification and Western‐blot analysis of recombinant OmpF and OmpK**

The PCR products of OmpF and OmpK genes were ligated to commercial pMD19‐T linearized vector (Takara, China) at 37°C for 6 hr. The ligated product was then cloned into a pET‐32a expression vector(Takara,China) and was transformed into competent *E. coli* BL21(DE3)cells (Takara, China). The recombinant transformants were selected using ampicil‐ lin (100 μg/ml) on LB agar plates. The colonies containing the recombi‐ nant plasmids were identified by PCR and restriction enzyme digestion. Overnight‐growing cultures of recombinant clones containing OmpF and OmpK genes were inoculated in LB broth containing ampicillin. Once an optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of the cultures reached 0.6–0.7, cells were induced for 4 hr with 1 mM isopropylthiogalactoside (IPTG) (Takara, China). Whole cell lysates of the bacteria were prepared, and the expres‐ sion of the recombinant proteins was examined by running on 12% SDS‐ PAGE. Nonrecombinant *E. coli* BL21 cells with IPTG and recombinant *E. coli* cells (with and without IPTG) were used as controls.

Recombinant OmpF protein (r‐OmpF) and r‐OmpK were purified as described previously (Zhang, Yu, & Qian, 2007), and the concentra‐ tion was measured by a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) kit (Thermo scientific, USA). The immunoreactivity of the r‐OmpF and r‐OmpK was detected with the sera from European eels vaccinated with whole cells of *A. hy‐ drophila* 322A and rabbits vaccinated with Omps of *A. hydrophila* 322A as described in our previous study (Liao, 2015). These two kinds of an‐ tisera were established and maintained in our lab.

## **2.5** | **Fish vaccination and sampling**

All immunizations were carried out by injecting 0.2 ml formulation intra‐ peritoneally. Fish were divided into four groups including PBS‐injected group (control, 0.2 ml sterile PBS), adjuvant‐injected group (0.2 ml ad‐ juvant Montanide™ ISA 763 A VG (Seppic, France) diluted in 3:7 ratio with PBS), r‐OmpF‐ or r‐OmpK‐immunized groups. Purified r‐Omp was mixed with the adjuvant in a 3:7 ratios (according to the manufacturer's instructions), and then this mixture (1mg/ml r‐Omp) was injected into fish at a dose of 2 μg/g body weight. Fish were immunized once.

Liver tissues were collected aseptically by sacrificing three fish from each group at 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, 72 hr and 10 days postimmuniza‐ tion, and were stored in RNAlater (Takara, China) at −80°C for RNA extraction.

# **2.6** | **RNA isolation, cDNA synthesis and expression analysis**

Approximately 100 mg liver tissues stored in RNAlater were utilized for extraction of total RNA using a TRI reagent (Sigma, USA) follow‐ ing the manufacturer's instructions. The quality and integrity of RNA were determined by using NanoDrop ND1000 (Thermo scientific, USA) and running electrophoresis in 1% agarose gel. 1 mg total RNA was reverse‐transcribed for preparation of cDNAs by using an RNA Reversing Kit (Takara, China). The cDNAs prepared were stored at −20°C until further use.

For relative quantitative expression analysis of six immune‐re‐ lated genes, *β‐actin* was included as an internal control for normal‐ ization. PCR conditions and the number of cycles for each test gene were optimized prior to the final expression analysis. Immune‐re‐ lated genes, *immunoglobulin M* (*IgM*, GenBank No. EU551244), *inter‐ leukin −10* (*IL‐10*, GenBank No. JN182215), *interferon regulatory factor 3* (*IRF3*, GenBank No. KF577783), *IRF7* (GenBank No. KF577784), *lysozyme G 4* (*LysG4*, GenBank No. KM454480) and *β subunit of N‐ acetyl‐β‐D‐hexosaminidase* (*HexB*, GenBank No. KY673794) were amplified in liver samples using gene‐specific primers (Table 1). Each PCR consisted of 2.5 μl cDNA, 12.5 μl SYBR® Premix Ex Taq™ (Tli RNaseH Plus) (Takara, China) and 5 pmoles each of forward and re‐ verse primers in a final reaction volume of 25 μl (made up with nu‐ clease free water). Amplification was initiated by initial denaturation at 95°C for 3 min, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 15 s, annealing at 62°C s for 15 s and extension at 72°C for 20 s, followed by a final extension of 10 min at 72°C. PCR cycles were performed on a CFX96™ Optics Module (Bio‐Rad, USA).

The fold change in expression of the target genes relative to the internal control gene (*β‐actin*) were analysed by the compara‐ tive *C*T method (2−ΔΔ*C*<sup>T</sup> method) (Livak & Schmittgen, 2001), where ΔΔ*C*<sup>T</sup> = (*C*T, Target-*C*T, Actin) test group-(*C*T, Target-*C*T, Actin) control group. The mean values ± standard error (SE) of the target gene expression rela‐ tive to *β‐actin* expression were presented from three tissue samples at each time point postimmunization.

## **2.7** | **Analysis of antibody response**

Nine eels from each group were bled aseptically from the caudal sinus after being anaesthetized by immersion into water containing anaesthetic MS222 (Sigma, USA) at 30 days postimmunization. The serum was separated, pooled and stored at −20°C. Sera from three eels of each group were combined as one sample, three replicates.

Using serum from PBS group as a negative control, the specific an‐ tibody response to r‐OmpF and r‐OmpK was measured by indirect enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (Kawai, Liu, Ohnishi & Oshima, 2004). The 96‐well plates were coated with the purified recombinant proteins. Two‐fold serial dilutions of the antisera with the first dilution of 1:100 were added to the triple wells of the plates with sera from the PBS‐injected group used as a negative control. Antibodies binding to the antigen were detected using mouse‐anti‐ eel IgM polyclonal antibody (provided by Institute of Biotechnology, Fujian Academy of Agricultural Sciences, China) with a 1:5,000 dilu‐ tion, followed by goat anti‐mouse IgG‐HRP (Sangon, China) used at a 1:5,000 dilution. The colour was developed with tetramethyl benzi‐ dine (TMB, Sangon, China) for 15 min and the reaction was stopped with 2.0 M H2SO4. The plates were read with an iMark™ Microplate Reader (Baocheng, China) at 450 nm. The results were considered to be positive if the absorbance was at least double that of the nega‐ tive control, and antibody titres were scored as having the highest positive dilution.

# **2.8** | **Experimental challenge and relative percent survival (RPS)**

At 15 d postimmunization, 20 fish from each group were experimen‐ tally challenged by intraperitoneal injection with 3.0 × 10<sup>8</sup> cfu/ml of *A. hydrophila* 322A (1 μl/g body weight). Bacterial suspension was prepared as follows: *A. hydrophila* 322A was grown overnight in LB broth at 28°C for 18 hr, and the cells were harvested by centrifuging at 3,000 g for 10 min, and washed with PBS three times. Bacteria were suspended in 10 mM PBS (pH 7.4) and was adjusted to the con‐ centration of 3.0 × 10<sup>8</sup> cfu/ml.

The challenge was performed once. Mortality was recorded daily up to 14 days, and the relative percent survival (RPS) was calculated following the methods of Amend (1981): RPS = (1‐mortality percent in test group/mortality percent in control group) × 100%.

## **2.9** | **Statistical analysis**

The data in terms of relative mRNA expression were analysed by Student's *t*‐test to determine the significant difference between the r‐OmpF‐/r‐OmpK‐ immunized group and the PBS‐injected group. The results of survival rates were analysed using a chi‐square test.

## **3** | **RESULTS**

# **3.1** | **Cloning, expression and immunoreactivity of OmpF and OmpK**

The PCR primers that were used in this study amplified a 987 bp fragment of OmpF gene and an 807 bp fragment of OmpK gene from *A. hydrophila* 322A (Figure S1a). The gene sequences of OmpF and OmpK were submitted to NCBI GenBank database (KX431033 and KX431034). The PCR products of OmpF and OmpK genes were li‐ gated to pMD19‐T vector (Figure S1b). The ligated product was then cloned into a pET32a vector and was transformed into *E. coli* BL21 competent cells (Figure S1c). After ampicillin selection, the positive colonies were identified by PCR and sequencing. The r‐OmpF and r‐OmpK were expressed under 4 hr of 1 mM IPTG induction. Two protein bands corresponding to 56 and 50 kD were detected in the induced *E. coli* BL21 harbouring pET32a‐OmpF and pET32a‐OmpK, respectively, while no protein band was found at the same posi‐ tion in the uninduced recombinant vectors by SDS‐PAGE analysis (Figure 1). The total concentrations of purified r‐OmpF and r‐OmpK were 1.43 and 1.53 mg/ml respectively. By Western‐blot analysis, both r‐OmpF and r‐OmpK bands were observed with the European eel antisera against whole cells of 322A and rabbit antisera against Omps of 322A (Figure 2).

## **3.2** | **Expression analysis of immune‐related genes**

To understand the expression changes of six genes involved in adap‐ tive and innate immune response after immunization with r‐OmpF and r‐OmpK, real‐time PCR was performed to detect their expres‐ sion levels in the liver tissues of eels at different time points postim‐ munization. A higher expression of *IgM* was observed in most of the periods postimmunization in r‐OmpF‐ and r‐OmpK‐immunized groups. At 12 hpi, *IgM* was significantly increased in both immunized groups (*p* < .05). In addition, the *IgM* expression was significantly higher at 3 hpi, 6 hpi and 10 dpi in r‐OmpK‐immunized fish (*p* < .01)

(Figure 3a). The upregulation of *IL‐10* expression was found in the r‐ OmpF‐immunized group at early time points, i.e. 3, 6 and 12 hpi, and in the r‐OmpK‐immunized group at 24 and 72 hpi (Figure 3b). No sig‐ nificant upregulation of *IRF‐3* was found in the r‐OmpF‐immunized group except at 6 hpi (*p* < .05), whereas its expression significantly increased at 12 and 72 hpi in the r‐OmpK‐immunized group (*p* < .05) (Figure 3c). A significantly higher *IRF‐7* expression was evident in the r‐OmpF‐immunized group at 3 hpi and in the r‐OmpK‐immunized group at 1, 6, 24 and 72 hpi (*p* < .01) (Figure 3d). At 12 and 24 hpi, fish in the r‐OmpF‐immunized group showed a significantly higher *LysG4* expression compared to those in the PBS‐injected group (*p* < .01), while fish in the r‐OmpK‐immunized group showed a higher expres‐ sion at 6, 12, 24 and 72 hpi and at 10 dpi (*p* < .05) (Figure 3e). An increased *HexB* expression could be observed among fish in r‐OmpF‐ immunized group at 1 and 24 hpi. There was also a remarkable in‐ crease in *HexB* level in the r‐OmpK‐immunized group at 12 and 72 hpi (*p* < .01) (Figure 3f).

# **3.3** | **Serum antibody response to r‐OmpF/ r‐OmpK immunization**

After 30 dpi, using serum of PBS‐injected group as a negative con‐ trol, indirect ELISA showed that the serum antibody titres for r‐ OmpF‐ and r‐OmpK‐immunized groups were 1:1,600 and 1:3,200 respectively.

# **3.4** | **Challenge experiment to evaluate the immunogenic efficacy**

After being challenged with live *A. hydrophila* 322A, most of the eels died in the PBS‐injected group and in the Seppic adjuvant‐in‐ jected group within 6 days; the survival rate was 28.4% and 37.5% respectively. Fish vaccinated with r‐OmpF and r‐OmpK were pro‐ tected when challenged with *A. hydrophila* 322A, and exhibited a survival rate of 53.8% and 78.6% respectively (Figure 4). RPS values of r‐OmpF and r‐OmpK proteins were calculated to be 35.5% and 70.0% respectively. The results of the chi‐squre test showed that compared with PBS‐injected group, the survival rates of r‐OmpF‐ and r‐OmpK‐ immunized groups were both statistically significant (*p* < .05) from 6 to 14 days post challenge. An ulcer on the injection sites and lesions of the liver were observed in the diseased fish, and the *A. hydrophila* 322A was isolated from all the dying or dead eels (data not shown).

## **4** | **DISCUSSION**

*A. hydrophila* is one of the most common pathogenic bacteria in freshwater farming of eel in China and has plagued the aquaculture for many years (Feng et al., 2017). Therefore, it is necessary to de‐ velop an efficient vaccine to control this pathogen. Outer membrane proteins of bacteria have become popular vaccine candidates based on the following characters: First, they are immunogenic and could trigger the body's immune response. Second, they are expressed on the surface of bacteria so that they are easily recognized by anti‐ gen presenting cells. Third, they are highly conserved among various members of the same species (Khushiramani, Girisha, Karunasagar & Karunasagar, 2007; Wang et al., 2017). In this study, OmpF and OmpK of *A. hydrophila* 322A were screened, and their potentials as vaccine candidates were evaluated in European eels*.*

The protective immune response induced by a vaccine is often accompanied with the expression changes of immune‐related genes in vaccinated fish. Here, we examined the expression changes of six genes that are involved in adaptive and innate immune responses in the liver tissues of eels after immunization with r‐OmpF and r‐ OmpK. We found that all the tested genes responded to r‐OmpF or r‐OmpK vaccination at varying degrees (Figure 3). IgM is primarily a systemic immunoglobulin and plays a key role in the adaptive im‐ munity of fish. We observed higher *IgM* expressions at 3, 6 and 12 hpi and at 10 dpi in the r‐OmpK‐vaccinated group (Figure 3a), which meant that r‐OmpK may induce a stronger antibody response than r‐OmpF in European eels. This deduction was further supported by serum antibody titre test, in which r‐OmpK and r‐OmpF induced 1:3,200 and 1:1,600 serum antibody titres respectively. IL‐10 is an effective anti‐inflammatory cytokine, and it could protect tissues from damage by excessive adaptive immunity. The *IL‐10* expression was significantly upregulated by bacterial vaccine in large yellow croaker (*Larimichthys crocea*), which suggested that it may play an anti‐inflammatory role in the immune response induced by bacterial vaccine (Zheng et al., 2017). The other four genes that are involved in innate immune response, *IRF3*, *IRF7*, *LysG4* and *HexB*, were also upregulated by r‐OmpF and r‐OmpK vaccination. IRF3 and IRF7 have been identified as main regulators of the type I interferon (IFN) gene expression in mammals (Honda & Taniguchi, 2006). These two genes were proven to be more likely involved in the antiviral immune response; however, they also responded to the LPS and *Edwardsiella tarda* challenges to some extent (Huang, Huang, & Nie, 2014). Here, we found that both *IRF3* and *IRF7* were upregulated by r‐OmpF and r‐OmpK vaccinations (Figure 3c,d). These observa‐ tions suggested that fish *IRF3* and *IRF7* might have a role in the anti‐ bacterial immune responses. Lysozyme is considered to be a typical acute‐phase molecule in vaccine‐induced immune response (Dash et al., 2014; Mu, Pridgeon, & Klesius, 2011; Zhang et al., 2012).

FIGURE 3 Expression analysis of six immune‐related genes in liver tissues of European eels postimmunization (i.p.) with r‐OmpF and r‐OmpK. Real‐time PCR was performed to detect the expression levels of six genes (*IgM*, *IL‐10*, *IRF3*, *IRF7*, *LysG4* and *HexB*) at different time points postimmunization. All data were obtained from three tissue samples at each time point. Error bars represent the standard error of the mean. \* (*p* < .05) and \*\* (*p* < .01) stand for significant differences

N‐acetyl‐β‐D‐hexosaminidase (Hex) was one of crucial effectors for defense against bacterial invasion, and its bactericidal mecha‐ nism involved the degradation of bacterial cell wall peptidoglycan like lysozyme (Fukuishi et al., 2014; Koo et al., 2008). A significantly

increasing expression of *LysG4* (g‐type lysozyme) and *HexB* (β sub‐ unit of Hex) was observed after vaccination (Figure 3e,f), which suggested that these two genes may be involved in the immune re‐ sponses that are induced by r‐OmpF and r‐OmpK.

FIGURE 4 The survival rates of European eels challenged (i.p) by *Aeromonas hydrophila* 322A 15 days postimmunization (i.p.) with r‐OmpF and r‐OmpK. \* (*p* < .05) stands for significant difference between treating groups and PBS control group at the same time point postimmunization

Our challenge experiments showed that significant protection with 70.0% RPS was achieved by vaccination with r‐OmpK, whereas only 35.5% RPS was obtained in r‐OmpF‐immunized fish (Figure 4). *A. hydrophila* 322A which was used for challenge experiments, was isolated from the ulcer on the injection sites and lesions of liver, which indicated that the death was directly related to the challenging bacteria. Other *A. hydrophila* Omps have exhibited different vaccine efficacies. For example, recombinant OmpG showed significant pro‐ tection against the challenge of two *A. hydrophila* strains in European eels (70% and 50% RPS respectively) (Guan et al., 2011). Common carps (*C. carpio*) that were immunized with two recombinant Omps (Aha1 and OmpW) were also protected against *A. hydroph‐ ila* infection (52% and 71% RPS respectively) (Maiti, Shetty, Shekar, Karunasagar, & Karunasagar, 2012). Chinese breams (*M. amblyceph‐ ala*) that were vaccinated with recombinant Omp38 were well‐pro‐ tected when challenged with *A. hydrophila* (57.14% RPS) (Wang et al., 2013). Abdelhamed et al. (2017) obtained 98.59%, 95.59% and 47.89% RPS with three recombinant Omps (OmpA1, Tdr, and TbpA) against *A. hydrophila* infection in channel catfish (*Ictalurus puncta‐ tus*). Different protective efficacies of vaccines may be attributed to the immunogenicity of vaccines, the method of immunization, the developmental stage of host, and the doses of challenging bacte‐ ria. Therefore, further challenge experiments coupled with dosage determination need to be carried out to maximize the protective ef‐ ficacy of r‐OmpK.

In conclusion, we evaluated the immune effects of r‐OmpF and r‐OmpK by postimmunization gene expression analysis, serum an‐ tibody response and experimental challenge. Based on the results obtained here, it was found that r‐OmpK had more potential as a vaccine candidate of *A. hydrophila* than r‐OmpF.

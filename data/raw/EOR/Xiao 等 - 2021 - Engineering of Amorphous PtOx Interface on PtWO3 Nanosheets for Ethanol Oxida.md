**Direct and complete electro-oxidation of ethanol to CO2 is highly desirable for the commercialization of the direct ethanol fuel cells but is challenging. Current electrocatalysts (mainly Pt, Pd) for ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR), unfortunately, still suffer from low CO2 selectivity and rapid performance deterioration. In this study, a new Pt/***α***-PtOx/WO3 electrocatalyst containing amorphous PtOx structures is successfully synthesized via a facile hydrothermal reaction following Ar atmosphere annealing. The migration of lattice oxygens in the WO3 during the annealing process is confirmed as the mechanism for the formation and manipulation of amorphous interfaces containing PtOx species in the Pt/***α***-PtOx/WO3 electrocatalyst. The obtained Pt/***α***-PtOx/ WO3 with tunable amorphous PtOx interfaces favors the desorption of poisoning EOR intermediates (such as CO) and high CO2 selectivity. Therefore, the state-of-art of the Pt/***α***-PtOx/WO3 exhibits excellent EOR activity (2.76 A mg–1), stability (47.99% of the initial activity preserved after 3600 s), and particularly high CO2 selectivity (reached 21.9%, higher than most reported values for Pt or other noble metals based EOR catalysts). This study may provide a new strategy to improve the EOR performance of metal-based catalysts and to rationally design and prepare other high-performing electrocatalysts via engineering the amorphous interfaces.**

(DEFCs) are considered as promising and green power sources because of their theoretically gasoline-comparable energy density and secure processing.[1] The ethanol electro-oxidation is kinetics sluggish and undergoes a multi-step mechanism, generally including ethanol dissociative adsorption, CC bond cleavage, and dehydrogenation.[2] Platinum (Pt) is the best catalyst for the oxidation of a wide range of organic molecules and the most active and widely investigated anodic electrocatalyst for the ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR).[3] Yet, major challenges remain and thus hinder the wide-scale implementations of DEFCs. Firstly, the Pt-based catalysts, especially those Pt-sole ones, inevitably suffer from severe CO or other reaction intermediate poisoning, adversely affecting the stability.[4] Secondly, almost all current available Pt catalysts are incapable of selectively breaking the CC bond to achieve complete ethanol oxidation to CO2, leading to the failure to harvest a higher energy density.[5] It is

therefore of high significance to rationally design and fabricate advanced electrocatalysts ideally optimizing both the EOR catalytic performance and CO2 selectivity.

To overcome these challenges, great efforts have been devoted to the innovation of Pt-catalyst with high activity and selectivity.[6] The key points are to create sufficient isolated Pt active sites for improving the catalytic activity and more importantly, to introduce other functional sites for achieving high selectivity of CC bonds cleavage and attenuating catalyst poisoned by reaction intermediates (or suppressing the CO generation) simultaneously.[7]

Formatting oxygenated surface species (PtOx) in the surface or core structure of the Pt-based electrocatalysts through rational surface modification, deliberate support selection, or precise alloying with other metals or metal oxides, is a highly effective strategy to enhance the anti-CO property of the Ptcatalysts.[3a,8] The presence of PtOx promotes the adsorption of oxygen-containing species (OHads) decomposed from water, and accelerates the desorption of intermediates (CO, in particular) from catalyst surfaces. The oxidation efficiency of converting CO (COads) to CO2 on the catalyst surface is enhanced, and the long-term stability is improved.[9] However, the utilization of PtOx as active sites for enhancing the selectivity of CC

bond cleavage is elusive. It is necessary to be deeply explored for designing efficient EOR electrocatalysts.

Smart design and engineering of amorphous PtO<sub>v</sub> within Pt-based EOR catalyst is an intriguing strategy for the abovementioned purposes. The amorphous structure, a metastable state compared to its crystalline counterpart, is not periodic in an internal atom arrangement but a short-range order.[10] The structural feature of amorphous state endows PtO<sub>x</sub> part with the isotropic and homogeneous characters, [10d,e] which gives uniformly dispersed active sites with high and exclusive selectivity. Beyond the selectivity, amorphous materials also provide outstanding structure flexibility and a high surface-bulk ratio. Thus, it probably enables its composed catalyst to further promote the adsorption of reaction species and the desorption of intermediate species in catalytic reactions (weakening the CO poisoning in EOR).[10a,11] It is therefore conceivable that win-win effects can be obtained to further enhance the stability and CO2 selectivity of the EOR electrocatalyst by introducing an amorphous PtO<sub>x</sub> interface. To the best of our knowledge, there are no reports on the preparation of such amorphous PtO<sub>x</sub> interfaces. The fabrication of amorphous PtO<sub>x</sub>, however, consumes part of the isolated Pt sites and thus may sacrifice the catalytic activity. Further understanding of the relationship between PtO<sub>x</sub> and the EOR performance and balancing the ratio of Pt/PtO<sub>x</sub> is also highly desirable.

Herein, by using a common anoxic metal oxide (here, WO<sub>3</sub>) as the Pt-support and on the ground of the annealing process for preparing amorphous metal oxides, we successfully synthesize the Pt/\alpha-PtO<sub>v</sub>/WO<sub>3</sub> hybrid nanostructures with tunable amorphous PtO<sub>x</sub> interfaces (Scheme 1). The amorphous PtO<sub>v</sub> structures, confirmed by the high-resolution aberrationcorrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) images, are formed via the migration of lattice oxygens in the WO<sub>3</sub> during the annealing process.<sup>[12]</sup> The content of crystalline Pt and amorphous PtO<sub>v</sub> (in the range of 58% to 15%) can be easily tuned by controlling the annealing temperature. The Pt/α-PtO<sub>x</sub>/WO<sub>3</sub> catalysts show an excellent current density of 2.76 A mg<sup>-1</sup> for EOR, which remains 20 times higher than that of the commercial Pt/C after the durability test (lasting for 1 h). More intriguingly, the as-obtained Pt/α-PtO<sub>v</sub>/WO<sub>3</sub> catalyst exhibits remarkably high CO2 selectivity of 21.9%, making the  $Pt/\alpha$ - $PtO_v/WO_3$  a state-of-the-art EOR electrocatalyst when compared with the reported CO<sub>2</sub> selectivity for monometallic Pt (1-7.5%), Pd (2.5%) and Rh (14.5%).[13] By engineering the amorphous interface between Pt and the transition metal oxides and unraveling the structure-performance relationship of the electrocatalysts for ethanol oxidation, we expect this study can offer a useful guideline for further design and fabrication of highperformance electrocatalysts.

# 2. Result and Discussion

The initial Pt/WO3 heterostructures are synthesized by onepot solvothermal method with the assistance of HCHO (see Figure S1 in the Supporting Information for experimental details). Subsequently, the obtained Pt/WO<sub>3</sub> heterostructures are further annealed at 350 °C under Ar atmosphere, yielding Pt/α-PtO<sub>v</sub>/WO<sub>3</sub> nanostructures. Figure 1a shows the TEM image of the Pt/α-PtO<sub>x</sub>/WO<sub>3</sub> hybrid nanostructure, which clearly reveals that Pt nanoparticles (NPs) are decorated on the ultrathin WO<sub>3</sub> nanosheet, also proved by the atomic force microscopy investigations (Figure S2, Supporting Information). The lattice fringes with a distance of 0.23 nm corresponding to the (111) plane of the crystalline structure of Pt NPs are observed in the highresolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image (Figure 1b). The lattice fringes with a distance of 0.36 nm are assigned to the (200) plane of the WO<sub>3</sub> nanosheet. The Pt/ $\alpha$ -PtO<sub>v</sub>/WO<sub>3</sub> hybrids are further characterized by high angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) element mapping. The uniform distribution of W (red) and O (green) is observed in the whole nanosheets (Figure 1c) with the decoration of a small amount of Pt NPs (yellow) on the surface. The diameter of the Pt NPs immobilized on WO<sub>3</sub> nanosheets is about 3.4±0.9 nm, with the counted distribution shown in Figure 1d. As all the peaks labeled in Figure 1e, the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the samples is easily indexed to  $Pt/\alpha$ - $PtO_x/WO_3$  (JCPDs NO. 20–1324), with the (001), (020), and (200) crystal faces of WO<sub>3</sub> detected at 23.1°, 23.7°, and 24.1°, respectively. The peaks at 39.8° and 46.2° can be indexed to the (111) and (200) crystal faces of Pt NPs. No impurity diffraction peaks are found, and no obvious differences are observed when compared with the XRD patterns of the Pt/WO<sub>3</sub> without being subjected to the annealing process.

The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra are conducted to reveal the chemical state of the obtained  $Pt/\alpha PtO_x/WO_3$ . The full-scan XPS spectrum (Figure 1f) suggests that the hybrid nanomaterials are composed of W, O and Pt elements. Figure 1g shows that the Pt 4f doublet of the  $Pt/\alpha PtO_x/WO_3$  nanosheets. The Pt  $4f_{7/2}$  and  $4f_{5/2}$  are observed at 70.9 and 74.5 eV, accordingly, suggesting the  $Pt^0$  state corresponding to the metal Pt. Besides, another four small shoulder peaks are also observed. The peaks at 71.3 and 74.7 eV indicate the existence of  $Pt^{2+}$  species, while those at 71.9 and 75.2 eV correspond to  $Pt^{4+}$  species from Pt oxide species on the surface. [ $^{[3b,5b,14]}$  These  $Pt^{2+}/Pt^{4+}$  peaks are not observed within the  $Pt/WO_3$  sample without annealing (Figure S3b, Supporting Information), indicating the existence of the  $PtO_x$  in the obtained  $Pt/\alpha PtO_x/WO_3$  hybrids. The content of  $Pt^{2+}/Pt^{4+}$  is  $\approx 40\%$  via the integration of the XPS

peak area. The PtOx content in Pt/*α*-PtOx/WO3 nanostructure calculated from XPS is consistent with the result estimated by the projected area statistics of Pt NPs in **Figure 2**a. The energydispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) investigation (Figure S4, Supporting Information) also confirms the presence of PtOx, in which the atomic ratio of W, O, and Pt in the scope of Figure 1e is 16:58:26.

The formation of PtOx interface probably can be attributed to lattice oxygen migration from WO3 to the Pt NPs at the interface, which will be proved in the following discussion. XPS characterization evidently implies the migration of lattice oxygen during the annealing process. In Figure 1h, the W 4f doublet with the binding energies of 37.8 and 35.7 eV can be assigned to W6<sup>+</sup> species, and the W 4f doublet with 37.3 and 35.3 eV are attributed to W5+. The content of W5+ is estimated to be 30% by normalizing the integral area, which is higher than that of Pt/WO3 nanosheets before annealing (10%) (Figure S3c, Supporting Information). The different W5<sup>+</sup> contents between the Pt/*α*-PtOx/WO3 and Pt/WO3 suggests that the partial lattice oxygen is migrated from WO3 support to the Pt block. After annealing, the additional oxygen peak located at 532.45 eV is assigned to the O 1s in PtOx (Figure 1i) compared to the case in WO3 (Figure S3d, Supporting Information), which confirms the formation of PtOx at the interface. The formation mechanism

of the PtOx interface is also demonstrated by EPR (Figure S5, Supporting Information). The EPR signal at *g* = 2.004 corresponds to the electrons trapped in oxygen vacancies. The EPR analysis suggests that the oxygen vacancies in the Pt/*α*-PtOx/WO3 are higher than that of the Pt/WO3. Therefore, it is rational to deduce that the lattice oxygen migration from WO3 support during the annealing process, increasing the oxygen vacancies in the Pt/*α*-PtOx/WO3.

The PtOx interface formed between Pt NPs and WO3 nanosheets is amorphous, which is revealed in high-resolution aberration-corrected STEM images (Figure 2a). As shown in Figure 2a, the blue rectangle area is obviously ordered structure with a lattice distance of 0.23 nm corresponding to Pt (111) crystal. In contrast, the red cycle area gives a distinct disordered structure indicating the presence of an amorphous phase. The corresponding fast Fourier transform (FFT) patterns of the Pt/*α*-PtOx/WO3 hybrids also indicate the co-existence of both the amorphous and crystal structures (Figure 2a1,a2).

The insertion of lattice oxygen breaks the long-range ordered structure of Pt and leads to the formation of amorphous structure, and the lattice oxygen migration kinetics is further investigated by the parameters of the annealing (e.g., temperature, duration).[12b,c,15] Therefore, the content of the amorphous PtOx interface can be regulated by simply tuning the temperatures and the duration of the annealing process. It is noted that the content of the amorphous PtOx interface can be estimated by calculating the projection area of the amorphous interface and counting from a large number of nanoparticles (Figure S6, Supporting Information).[10a,16] As expected, when the annealing temperature is 300 °C, the content of amorphous PtOx in the Pt/*α*-PtOx/WO3-300 is 15% (Figure 2b, red frame). As the annealing temperature increases (350 °C), the content of amorphous PtOx is slightly increased (38%, as shown in Figure 2a). The maximum content of amorphous PtOx is around 58% when the annealing temperature increases to 400 °C (Pt/*α*-PtOx/WO3-400, Figure 2c). Surprisingly, the PtOx with the bare crystal phase (Pt/c-PtOx/WO3) is also achieved by annealing treatment at 600 °C for 1 h (Figure 2d). As shown in Figure 2d, the crystal structure of PtOx is circled by the orange line, confirmed by FFT in Figure 2d1. The crystal interface is calculated to be around 40% of overall Pt NPs by the projected area statistics, and the clear crystal boundary is recognized between the crystals. As the amorphous PtOx interface is critical for the EOR performance, tuning the ratio of the amorphous PtOx interface must greatly affect the subsequently electrochemical catalytic performance, and this issue is further discussed in the following section.

Electrocatalytic activities of the Pt/*α*-PtOx/WO3, and the other Pt-based electrodes are evaluated in the alkaline media (**Figure 3**). Cyclic voltammograms (CV) of the modified electrodes are tested in N2 saturated NaOH solution (0.1 m). The experiments were operated between −0.8 and 0.4 V (vs SCE) at ambient temperature with a scan rate of 50 mV s–1. As shown in Figure 3a, the voltammetric features of the Pt/*α*-PtOx/WO3 (the magenta line), the Pt/c-PtOx/WO3 (the blue line), the Pt/ WO3 (without annealing, the red line), and the commercial Pt/C are compared. The current peaks that appeared between −0.8 and −0.55 V for the Pt/*α*-PtOx/WO3 are ascribed to the hydrogen adsorption/desorption regions. Pt (110) plane shows the characteristic hydrogen adsorption peak at −0.70 V and desorption peak at −0.66 V. The well-defined hydrogen adsorption and desorption peaks of Pt (100) plane locate at −0.59 and −0.57 V, respectively. The current peaks at −0.13 and 0.04 V correspond to the oxidized species, and the peak at −0.27 V is due to the reduction of these oxidized species. Current densities are normalized to electrochemical active surface area (ECSA), and the calculation equation can be described as ECSA = *Q*H/210 (µC cm–2).[17] The ECSA of the Pt/*α*-PtOx/WO3, Pt/c-PtOx/WO3, Pt/WO3, and Pt/C are 15.16, 15.04, 9.16, and 5.35 cm2, respectively. The considerably higher ECSA of the Pt/*α*-PtOx/WO3, Pt/c-PtOx/WO3, and Pt/WO3 compared to Pt/C can be attributed to the excellent dispersity of Pt NPs. While the higher ECSA for the Pt/*α*-PtOx/WO3 and Pt/c-PtOx/WO3 compared to Pt/WO3 mainly result from the existence of the

PtOx interface. It can be concluded that the introduction of PtOx interface increases the active sites for the composed electrochemical catalyst, which is supposed to enhance the subsequent EOR performance.

EOR electrocatalytic activities of the catalysts are investigated with CV in the potential range of −0.8 to 0.4 V in the N2 saturated solution containing C2H5OH (0.5 m) and NaOH (0.1 m) at a scan rate of 50 mV s–1 (Figure 3b). In the anodic sweep, for the Pt/*α*-PtOx/WO3, the peak at around −0.20 V is attributed to the oxidation breakage of CC or CO bonds during the EOR. The current peak with a more positive value in the forward scan, a specific feature for the ethanol oxidation, is derived from the oxidation of the freshly chemisorbed species after ethanol adsorption.[18] The reason for the decrease in the current density at higher positive potentials is that the poison of Pt catalysts hinders the further oxidation of ethanol.[19] In the cathodic sweep, the removal of carbonaceous residues on the Pt surfaces shows a current peak at −0.38 V. Clearly, the electrochemical activity of the Pt/*α*-PtOx/WO3 and Pt/c-PtOx/WO3 toward EOR are much higher than that of the commercial Pt/C and Pt/WO3 (Figure 3b, black line and red line). The peak current density of the Pt/*α*-PtOx/WO3 and Pt/c-PtOx/WO3 is calculated to be 2.76 and 2.72 A mg–1, respectively, which is about 4 times over that of the Pt/C (0.64 A mg–1) and well consistent www.advancedsciencenews.com

with the result of the ECSA (Figure 3b inset). The peak current density of the  $Pt/\alpha$ - $PtO_x/WO_3$  and Pt/c- $PtO_x/WO_3$  is also higher than that of  $Pt/WO_3$  (1.39 A  $mg^{-1}$ ). This is a piece of strong evidence that  $PtO_x$  interface can facilitate the adsorption the reaction species, desorption of reaction intermediates, and thus enhances the EOR performance of their composed catalysts. [3a,6b,20] The peak current density of the Pt/c- $PtO_x/WO_3$  is close to that of the  $Pt/\alpha$ - $PtO_x/WO_3$ , suggesting that both the amorphous and crystalline  $PtO_x$  interface can contribute to the electrocatalytic activity.

Although both the crystalline and amorphous PtO<sub>x</sub> interfaces demonstrate similar electrocatalytic activity, the disordered amorphous PtO<sub>v</sub> structure renders its composed electrode with relatively high structural flexibility and surface-bulk ratio. [10a,d,21] Therefore, the presence of amorphous PtO<sub>x</sub> interface in the electrode can further promote the adsorption of reaction species and the desorption of intermediate species, weakening the CO poisoning in EOR and improving the stability of the obtained EOR catalysts.<sup>[21]</sup> Theoretically, both the two interfaces (the interface with WO<sub>3</sub> and the interface with Pt) play important roles in the EOR catalytic reaction. The interface between Pt and PtOx shows relatively low activation energy for the cleavage of C-C bond, and thus can facilitate the C-C bond cleavage. [7c,13d] However, the high activity of this interface also greatly promotes the accumulation of the CO intermediate, leading to the rapidly deactivated catalytic activity. Fortunately, the interface between WO3 and PtOx can compensate for such a negative effect by providing the abundant OH species, which will subsequently activate and react with the surface-adsorbed CO and facilitate the complete oxidation of ethanol (to CO<sub>2</sub>).<sup>[9d]</sup> To proof this hypothesis, the stability of Pt-based electrochemical EOR catalysts is investigated. The chronoamperometry (CA) measurement (at -0.2 V vs SCE) is performed in the mixture of NaOH (0.1 M) and C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OH (0.5 M) at ambient temperature for 3600 s. As shown in Figure 3c, the initial current intensities of the Pt/α-PtO<sub>x</sub>/WO<sub>3</sub>, Pt/c-PtO<sub>x</sub>/WO<sub>3</sub>, Pt/WO<sub>3</sub>, and Pt/C are 2.76, 2.72, 1.40, and 0.64 A mg<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. A sharp decay on the current density in 0-20 s for Pt/C and a significant decrease in 0-200 s for Pt/WO<sub>3</sub> is observed. The decrease of the current density for these two samples is attributed to the poisoning species and intermediate products induced decrease of active catalytic sites. Obviously, the decay rates of the current density of the  $Pt/\alpha$ - $PtO_x/WO_3$  and Pt/c- $PtO_x/WO_3$  are much slower. The enhanced stability of both the  $Pt/\alpha$ - $PtO_v/WO_3$  and Pt/c-PtO<sub>x</sub>/WO<sub>3</sub> is originated from the presence of PtO<sub>x</sub> interface, which can reduce the adsorption of intermediate products and poisoning species on the surface of the catalyst. Importantly, the current density for the Pt/\alpha-PtO<sub>v</sub>/WO<sub>3</sub> remains over 47.99% (1.32 A mg<sup>-1</sup>) of the original current density after 3600 s, which is significantly higher than that of the Pt/c-PtO<sub>x</sub>/ WO<sub>3</sub> (22.88%, 0.62 A mg<sup>-1</sup>) (Figure 3c, inset). As the main difference between the  $Pt/\alpha$ - $PtO_x/WO_3$  and Pt/c- $PtO_x/WO_3$  is the crystallinity of PtOx, the improvement of stability arises from the presence of the metastable amorphous PtO<sub>x</sub> interface. Furthermore, as indicated by TEM in Figure S7a (Supporting Information), the structures of the Pt/ $\alpha$ -PtO<sub>x</sub>/WO<sub>3</sub> are well retained after electrocatalytic measurements and no obvious accumulation of Pt NPs is observed. The high-resolution STEM image of Pt/α-PtO<sub>x</sub>/WO<sub>3</sub> (Figure S7b, Supporting Information) and

corresponding FFT patterns (Figure S7c,d: Supporting Information) also indicate the co-existence of both the amorphous and crystal structures, which proves the enhanced stability rendered by the introduced amorphous PtO<sub>v</sub> interface.

To further verify the anti-poisoning performance of the  $Pt/\alpha$ - $PtO_x/WO_3$ , the CO stripping voltammograms are carried out in a 0.1 M NaOH solution. As shown in Figure 3d, the onset potentials of CO oxidation are  $\approx$ -354, -313, -290, and -288 mV on the catalysts  $Pt/\alpha$ - $PtO_x/WO_3$ , Pt/c- $PtO_x/WO_3$ ,  $Pt/WO_3$ , and Pt/C, respectively. Clearly, the  $Pt/\alpha$ - $PtO_x/WO_3$  demonstrates a lower onset than that of other Pt-based catalysts, suggesting the easier CO desorption from the amorphous  $PtO_x$  interface. Furthermore, for CO stripping, the peak on the  $Pt/\alpha$ - $PtO_x/WO_3$  is about -206 mV lower than that of the Pt/c- $PtO_x/WO_3$ ,  $Pt/WO_3$ , and Pt/C (in Table S1 in the Supporting Information). Therefore, the  $Pt/\alpha$ - $PtO_x/WO_3$  shows a higher activity on CO oxidation, leading to the higher stability of the  $Pt/\alpha$ - $PtO_x/WO_3$  over other electrodes.

The ability to remove CO on the surface of Pt-based electrodes is also evaluated by the d-band center. As shown in Figure 3e, the d-band centers are calculated according to the surface valence band photoemission spectra of different samples. Apparently, the d-band centers of the Pt/WO3, Pt/c-PtOx/WO3, and Pt/ $\alpha$ -PtOx/WO3 exhibit downward shifts compared with that of the Pt/C. Meanwhile, the d-band center of the Pt/ $\alpha$ -PtOx/WO3 is the most low-lying of –4.662 eV. The lower-lying (relative to the Fermi level) means the weaker the binding due to the occupancy of anti-bonding states. Therefore, the binding strength of intermediates such as CO on the Pt/ $\alpha$ -PtOx/WO3 should decrease as the downshift of the d-band center. The amorphous PtOx interface can remove the CO intermediates, and accounts for the remarkable stability on EOR.

The EOR electrocatalytic properties of the  $Pt/\alpha$ - $PtO_x/WO_3$ with different Pt contents are then fabricated and investigated for comparison. The loading of Pt NPs within the heterostructure can be regulated by adding different amounts of Pt precursors. When the amount of H<sub>2</sub>PtCl<sub>6</sub> is in the range of 0.5 to 1 mL (Figure S8a,b: Supporting Information), the Pt NPs are immobilized on the nanosheets with a low surface density, and the loading of Pt is measured to be 5.7% and 8.9% (based on ICP-OES analysis), respectively. The addition of 2 mL H<sub>2</sub>PtCl<sub>6</sub> results in the formation of the  $Pt/\alpha$ - $PtO_x/WO_3$  with Pt content of 15.1%, and the as-obtained Pt/α-PtO<sub>x</sub>/WO<sub>3</sub> shows the relatively high density of Pt NPs on the surface of nanosheets (see Figure 1a). When the amount of H<sub>2</sub>PtCl<sub>6</sub> is 3 mL, the homogeneous nucleation of Pt NPs is observed together with the formation of  $Pt/\alpha$ - $PtO_x/WO_3$  in the solution, and the Pt content is around 19.8% (Figure S8c, Supporting Information). The electrochemical performance of these obtained Pt/α-PtO<sub>x</sub>/WO<sub>3</sub> with different Pt content are further evaluated. As shown in Figure S9a (Supporting Information), the current peaks between -0.8 and -0.5 V are assigned to the hydrogen adsorption/desorption region. The measured ECSA of the catalysts decrease in the order of  $Pt/\alpha$ - $PtO_x/WO_3$  (15.1%) (15.16 cm<sup>2</sup>) >  $Pt/\alpha$ - $PtO_x/WO_3$ (19.8%)  $(13.64 \text{ cm}^2) > \text{Pt}/\alpha - \text{PtO}_x/\text{WO}_3$  (8.9%)  $(12.55 \text{ cm}^2) > \text{Pt}/\alpha - \text{PtO}_x/\text{PtO}_3$  $PtO_x/WO_3$  (5.7%) (10.62 cm<sup>2</sup>) > Pt/C (5.35 cm<sup>2</sup>). As observed, all the  $Pt/\alpha$ - $PtO_x/WO_3$  catalysts exhibit higher peak intensity than that of the Pt/C, and the Pt/ $\alpha$ -PtO<sub>x</sub>/WO<sub>3</sub> (15.1%) catalyst shows the highest anodic peak. Moreover, the peak intensities

vary with different Pt atomic ratio, and is in the following order  $Pt/\alpha$ - $PtO_x/WO_3$  (15.1%) (2.76 A mg<sup>-1</sup>) >  $Pt/\alpha$ - $PtO_x/WO_3$  (19.8%) (2.74 A mg<sup>-1</sup>) >  $Pt/\alpha$ - $PtO_x/WO_3$  (8.9%) (2.52 A mg<sup>-1</sup>) >  $Pt/\alpha$ - $PtO_x/WO_3$  (5.7%) (2.38 A mg<sup>-1</sup>) > Pt/C (0.64 A mg<sup>-1</sup>), as shown in Figure S9b (Supporting Information). When the Pt content is lower than 15.1%, the increase of the Pt content will increase catalytic sites and the enhancement of electronic conductivity. However, when the Pt content is higher than 15.1%, such as, 19.8% of Pt, it leads to a slight decrease in the catalytic activity. This is due to the restricted utilization efficiency of Pt NPs generated by the serious aggregation of redundant Pt NPs (Figure S8c, Supporting Information). Therefore, the  $Pt/\alpha$ - $PtO_x/WO_3$  (15.1%) is selected as the best electrocatalyst with the optimal Pt loading to explore the influence of amorphous  $PtO_x$  content on the performance of EOR.

The ratio of Pt/PtO<sub>v</sub> is also a critical factor that determines the EOR performance of the Pt/\alpha-PtOx/WO3 electrodes. As shown in Figure S10 (Supporting Information), the voltammetric features of the Pt/α-PtO<sub>y</sub>/WO<sub>3</sub> with different ratios of Pt/PtO<sub>x</sub> are compared to those of the commercial Pt/C and the Pt/WO<sub>3</sub>. The peak current density of Pt/α-PtO<sub>x</sub>/WO<sub>3</sub> (PtO<sub>x</sub> 38%) is 2.76 A mg<sup>-1</sup>, which is slightly lower than that of  $Pt/\alpha$ -PtO<sub>x</sub>/WO<sub>3</sub>-300 (PtO<sub>x</sub> 15%) (2.79 A mg<sup>-1</sup>). Further increasing amorphous PtO<sub>x</sub> (Pt/α-PtO<sub>y</sub>/WO<sub>3</sub>-400, PtO<sub>x</sub> 58%) results in a significant decrease of peak current density (2.54 A mg<sup>-1</sup>). The more ratio of PtOx, the less content of Pt is presented in the Pt/α-PtO<sub>x</sub>/WO<sub>3</sub> hybrids. The decreasing of Pt content reduces the number of the active catalytic sites from crystalline Pt, which weakens the adsorption of dissociative ethanol and the cleavage of the C-C bond (Figure S10a,b: Supporting Information). Meanwhile, the stability of  $Pt/\alpha$ - $PtO_x/WO_3$  is closely related to the ratio of amorphous PtOx. As shown in Figure S10c,d (Supporting Information), the stability of the  $Pt/\alpha$ -PtO<sub>v</sub>/WO<sub>3</sub>-400 (PtO<sub>v</sub> 58%) is better than that of Pt/ $\alpha$ -PtO<sub>v</sub>/  $WO_3$  (PtO<sub>y</sub> 38%), Pt/ $\alpha$ -PtO<sub>y</sub>/ $WO_3$ -300 (PtO<sub>y</sub> 15%), Pt/ $WO_3$ , and Pt/C. Therefore, to obtain the best performance (considering both catalytic activity and stability), the ratio of amorphous PtO<sub>x</sub> and crystalline Pt should be controlled reasonably, and the Pt/α-PtO<sub>v</sub>/WO<sub>3</sub> with 38% amorphous PtO<sub>v</sub> is optimized as the suitable candidate.

Beyond the catalytic activity and stability, the amorphous  $PtO_x$  interface is a critical factor that determines the C-C cleavage toward EOR. In general, the reaction mechanisms of the EOR usually follow a dual-pathway ( $C_1$  and  $C_2$ ) with detailed reactions listed below: (2a,13b,24)

$$CH_3CH_2OH + 12OH^- \rightarrow 2CO_2 + 9H_2O + 12e^-$$
 (1)

$$CH_3CH_2OH + 5OH^- \rightarrow CH_3COO^- + 4H_2O + 4e^-$$
 (2)

In the  $C_1$ -pathway (reaction 1), the ethanol is completely oxidized via the cleavage of C-C bonds to form  $CO_2$  with 12 electrons delivered. While reaction 2 ( $C_2$ -pathway) involves only 4 electrons for oxidizing ethanol to acetic acid. The more ethanol molecules are converted to  $CO_2$  via the  $C_1$ -pathway, the higher energy density will be obtained. To further clarify the role of amorphous  $PtO_x$  interlayer, in situ Fourier transform infrared (in situ FTIR) measurements are carried out for

Pt-based catalysts at potentials (vs SCE) between -0.8 and 0.3 V at 0.1 V intervals, and the results are shown in Figure 4a (Pt/C), Figure 4b (Pt/WO<sub>3</sub>), Figure 4c (Pt/c-PtO<sub>v</sub>/WO<sub>3</sub>), and Figure 4d  $(Pt/\alpha-PtO_v/WO_3)$ . The characteristic bands (1087 and 1045 cm<sup>-1</sup>) of the stretch of C-O are observed in all spectra, which can be attributed to the ethanol adsorption on the catalysts. The strong peaks at 1550 and 1414 cm<sup>-1</sup> are also identified, which can be assigned to the asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrational of O-C-O in CH<sub>3</sub>COO<sup>-</sup> ions (from the C<sub>2</sub>-pathway), respectively. For the  $Pt/\alpha$ - $PtO_x/WO_3$ , Pt/c- $PtO_x/WO_3$ , and Pt/WO<sub>3</sub>, a band at 1414 cm<sup>-1</sup> with higher intensity and more asymmetrical shape than that at 1550 cm<sup>-1</sup> is observed. [25] This can be explained by the generation of carbonate (CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup>) ions on the surface of catalyst, which introduces a band at 1390 cm<sup>-1</sup> overlapping with that at 1414 cm<sup>-1</sup>. The presence of CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup> indicates the formation of CO<sub>2</sub> from the cleavage of C-C bonds in ethanol molecules in high pH environments.[13d,26] However, for the Pt/C catalyst, the band at 1550 cm<sup>-1</sup> shows higher intensity than that at 1414 cm<sup>-1</sup>, suggesting less CO<sub>2</sub> formation on the surface of the Pt/C. For the Pt/C, Pt/WO<sub>3</sub>, and Pt/c-PtO<sub>x</sub>/WO<sub>3</sub> electrodes, a vibrational peak at 2000 cm<sup>-1</sup> is observed, which can be assigned to bonded CO on the electrode surface. [26b,c] Moreover, this band becomes weak on the surface of the Pt/ $\alpha$ -PtO<sub>x</sub>/WO<sub>3</sub> at high potential, suggesting fast CO oxidation and desorption from the surface of the Pt/α-PtO<sub>v</sub>/WO<sub>3</sub>. The CO intermediate can be oxidized and desorbed promptly, which is responsible for durable stability. Besides that, a weak peak at around 2341 cm<sup>-1</sup> is observed for all four samples, derived from the O-C-O asymmetric stretching of CO<sub>2</sub>, indicating the C-C bond cleavage ability of Pt-based catalysts. [9a,27]

To further clarify the C-C cleavage capability of different Ptbased catalysts, the distribution of soluble products (CH<sub>3</sub>COO<sup>-</sup>, CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup>, and CO<sub>2</sub>) in the catalytic reaction is analyzed by the previously reported quantification method. The IR transmission spectra of CH<sub>3</sub>COONa (0.02 M), Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> (0.02 M) and CO<sub>2</sub> saturated solution are collected successively to evaluate the relative concentration  $(C_R)$  of each species by using the expression C = A - kB, where k is a coefficient, and A and B represent the intensity obtained from the in situ spectrum and the transmission spectrum, respectively.[13b,28] Figure 4e,f shows the potential dependence of the  $C_R$  of  $C_1$  (CO<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup>) and CH<sub>3</sub>COO<sup>-</sup> in the thin-lay solution during EOR. The  $Pt/\alpha$ - $PtO_x/WO_3$ always exhibits higher  $C_R$  of  $C_1$  products than those of the other Pt-based catalysts at higher potential (e.g., E > -0.5V). This result indicates that ethanol is more completely oxidized on the Pt/α-PtO<sub>x</sub>/WO<sub>3</sub> than other electrodes, which is attributed to the enhanced C-C cleavage and efficient ethanol splitting over the amorphous PtO<sub>x</sub> interface. Meanwhile, both the Pt/α-PtO<sub>x</sub>/  $WO_3$  and the  $Pt/c-PtO_x/WO_3$  exhibit lower  $C_R$  of  $C_2$  products than that of the Pt/WO<sub>3</sub> electrode in the range of -0.3 to 0.3 V. Obviously, lower C<sub>2</sub> products indicates less incompletely ethanol oxidation, which is consistent with the observation from Figure 4g. Based on the product distributions obtained from the in-situ spectra (Figure 4a–d), the  $CO_2$  selectivity ( $\eta$ ) of EOR is evaluated as follows:

$$\eta = \frac{\left(\left[CO_3^{2-}\right] + \left[CO_2\right]\right)/2}{\left[CH_3COO^{-}\right] + \left(\left[CO_3^{2-}\right] + \left[CO_2\right]\right)/2}$$

The complete oxidation of one ethanol molecule produces two molecules of  $C_1$  ( $CO_2$  or  $CO_3^{2-}$ ), so their concentrations are divided by the factor of 2 in Equation (3). The calculated selectivity of the  $Pt/\alpha$ - $PtO_x/WO_3$ , Pt/c- $PtO_x/WO_3$ ,  $Pt/WO_3$ , and Pt/C are 21.9%, 18.0%, 15.7%, and 12.2%, respectively. Obviously, the outstanding performance of the  $Pt/\alpha$ - $PtO_x/WO_3$  is achieved in this study toward complete ethanol electro-oxidation. Moreover,

the  $C_1$  selectivity of the  $Pt/\alpha$ - $PtO_x/WO_3$  at room temperature is also notably higher than that of the reported monometallic Pt (1–7.5%) and Pd (2.5%). The oxidation products are further analyzed to verify the high  $C_1$  product selectivity of the  $Pt/\alpha$ - $PtO_x/WO_3$  using nuclear magnetic resonance ( $^1H$  NMR) and ion chromatography (IC) analyses (Figure S11, Supporting Information).

and carbonate (from  $C_1$ -pathway) are calculated based on the previously reported method.  $^{[23c,29]}$  For the  $Pt/\alpha$ - $PtO_x/WO_3$ , the Faradaic efficiency of acetate is 75% which is lower than that of the Pt/c- $PtO_x/WO_3$  (86%),  $Pt/WO_3$  (91%), and Pt/C (95%) (Figure S11d, Supporting Information). This result indicates that the  $C_1$ -pathway is more favored on the  $Pt/\alpha$ - $PtO_x/WO_3$ . The amorphous  $PtO_x$  interface generates more  $OH_{ad}$  and promotes CO removal from the surface of the  $Pt/\alpha$ - $PtO_x/WO_3$ , which alleviates the obstacles of complete ethanol oxidation to  $CO_2$ .  $^{[29]}$ 

# 3. Conclusion

In summary,  $Pt/\alpha \cdot PtO_x/WO_3$  with tunable amorphous  $PtO_x$  interface is synthesized via a facile hydrothermal method following an annealing process. The obtained  $Pt/\alpha \cdot PtO_x/WO_3$  as EOR catalyst not only possesses high catalytic activities but shows excellent  $CO_2$  selectivity toward EOR in an alkaline environment. The existence of amorphous  $PtO_x$  interfaces in  $Pt/\alpha \cdot PtO_x/WO_3$  promotes the cleavage of the C—C bond in ethanol and paves for outstanding electro-catalytic performances. The  $CO_2$  selectivity (complete ethanol oxidation) on the  $Pt/\alpha \cdot PtO_x/WO_3$  is measured to be 21.9%, much higher than most reported values for monometallic Pt or/and Pd at room temperature. Considering the excellent electro-catalytic activity and  $CO_2$  selectivity toward EOR, the direct ethanol fuel cell with a considerably higher energy density may be obtained by using the  $Pt/\alpha \cdot PtO_x/WO_3$  catalysts.

#### 1. Introduction

Direct ethanol fuel cells (DEFCs), as a promising energy conversion device, have attracted a great deal of attention, because they are in line with the requirements of green chemistry.<sup>1-4</sup> However, the low activity of anodic catalysts for oxidation of ethanol and the poisoning of the catalyst electrode by CO-like intermediates are significant barriers to the successful commercialization of DEFCs.<sup>5-7</sup> Therefore, it is imperative to develop more efficient and stable DEFC anodic catalysts.

Among the widely used DEFC anodic catalysts, platinum (Pt)-based materials are flagship catalysts for the ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) in an acidic medium.<sup>8–15</sup> The further development and application of the EOR have been impeded by their low efficiency and susceptibility to the toxicity of the CO-like intermediates in alkaline media.<sup>16–19</sup> Palladium has a similar electron structure to Pt, as well as advantages of low cost, high reserves, and superior effectiveness against ethanol under alkaline conditions.<sup>20,21</sup> It has inspired further work

In recent years, the applications of bi- or multi-metallic catalysts have drawn increasing attention owing to their synergistic effect among related metallic species. 22-26 Among various Pd-based catalysts for the EOR, the introduction of oxophilic metallic elements (e.g., Au, Ag, Ru, Cu, or Ni) into bimetallic PdM or trimetallic PdM<sub>1</sub>M<sub>2</sub> alloys would facilitate the formation of metal-adsorbed OH (M-OHads) to promote the removal of poisoning intermediates, and finally accelerate the EOR. 22,27,28 Also, the adsorption affinity of poisoning intermediates on Pd-based nanoalloys would be weakened through d-band theory, thus effectively facilitating the EOR. 16,29 Trimetallic nanocatalysts even exhibited remarkably enhanced catalytic activity bimetallic compared their counterparts.30-32

Apart from the composition, the structure of noble metal nanocatalysts also has a strong effect on their (electro)catalytic performance.<sup>33,34</sup> Typically, the blackberry-like nanostructure with anisotropic branches shows an excellent catalytic activity, because of its high specific surface area and abundant active sites.<sup>35–37</sup> A high-performance nanocatalyst can be expected when it achieved the optimized balance between composition and surface structure.<sup>29,30</sup> Therefore, it is of great significance to develop an effective synthetic strategy for fabricating trimetallic nanoalloys with a blackberry-like structure. These trimetallic NPs with tunable composition would provide a platform to investigate the relationship between composition and electrocatalytic properties.

Nanoscale Paper

After incorporation of Au and(or) Cu into Pd, the binary or ternary Pd-based nanoparticles usually exhibited excellent mass activity for the EOR and tolerance for CO.20,22,38 Herein, we presented a facile one-pot solution-phase synthetic approach to fabricate the composition-controlled blackberrylike ternary PdAuCu nanoparticles (PdAuCu NPs) and further investigated their composition effect in the EOR. The Pd content was controlled by simply adjusting the ratios of corresponding metal precursors. The as-synthesized catalysts were systematically characterized to confirm the morphology, component and structure. It is worth noting that the alloyed PdAuCu NPs are obtained at a low addition amount of Pd precursors; nevertheless, satellite PdAuCu NPs are produced at a high addition amount of Pd precursors. With the optimization of Pd contents, the PdAuCu NPs-0.5 achieved the best mass activity of 23.0 A mg<sub>Pd</sub><sup>-1</sup> towards ethanol electrooxidation among all tested catalysts, which is also higher than the reported Pd-based catalysts to date. Charge transfer kinetics, electrochemical impedance and anti-poisoning behaviour for the EOR were performed. The results demonstrated that the optimizing composition and surface structure of PdAuCu NPs play a key role in accelerating the electrocatalytic EOR.

#### 2. Experimental

#### 2.1 Materials

Potassium tetrachloropalladate( $\Pi$ ) ( $K_2PdCl_4$ ), potassium tetrachloroaurate( $\Pi$ ) ( $KAuCl_4\cdot 2H_2O$ ), and copper( $\Pi$ ) chloride dihydrate ( $CuCl_2\cdot 2H_2O$ ) were obtained from Energy Chemical. Polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP, K30) was supplied by Shanghai Chemical Corp. Ethanol ( $CH_3CH_2OH$ , 99.7%), L-ascorbic acid (AA, 99%) and potassium hydroxide (KOH) were provided by Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd (Shanghai). Nafion solution (5 wt% in propanol and water) and commercial Pd/C (20 wt%) were purchased from Alfa Aesar. All the reagents are of analytical grade and used without further purification. Water ( $H_2O$ , 18  $M\Omega$ ) used in all measurements were prepared using an ultra-pure purification system (HHitech, Eco-S15UF).

#### 2.2. Characterization

The morphology and chemical compositions of the materials were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL 2100F), scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Zeiss Sigma300) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX, FEI Talos F200X). X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) was carried out using an X'Pert PROMPD diffractometer (Panalytical B.V.) with nickel filtered Cu K $\alpha$  radiation. The Au, Pd and Cu contents of the materials were estimated with an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-AES, Thermo Jarrell Ash). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo Fischer, ESCALAB Xi+) was used to determine the surface electron states of the materials. The binding energies in the XPS spectra were calibrated by setting the adventitious C 1s peak to 284.8 eV.

#### 2.3. Preparation of PdAuCu NPs

In a typical synthesis of the PdAuCu NPs, 2.0 mL of K<sub>2</sub>AuCl<sub>4</sub>·2H<sub>2</sub>O (20 mM), 1.0 mL of K<sub>2</sub>PdCl<sub>4</sub> (20 mM), 1.0 mL of CuCl<sub>2</sub>·2H<sub>2</sub>O (20 mM) solution and 40 mg of PVP were dissolved in a beaker and gently stirred for 5 min. Then, after the addition of 0.4 mL of fresh AA (0.4 M) at room temperature, the solution was stirred continuously for 2 h. The final product was demonstrated as PdAuCu NPs-1 and further purified by centrifugation and washing using ethanol and deionized water. Changing the K<sub>2</sub>PdCl<sub>4</sub> solution volume of 0.1, 0.5, 2, and 3 mL, a number of PdAuCu NPs were obtained and marked as PdAuCu NPs-(0.1, 0.5, 2, and 3) NPs, respectively. Similarly, bimetallic PdAu PdCu and AuCu NPs were synthesized using the same procedure, in the absence of CuCl<sub>2</sub>·2H<sub>2</sub>O, KAuCl<sub>4</sub>·2H<sub>2</sub>O and K<sub>2</sub>PdCl<sub>4</sub> respectively.

#### 2.4. Electrochemical EOR measurements

Electrochemical measurements were performed with a threeelectrode setup by using a CHI 660E electrochemical analyser. The platinum foil  $(2 \times 2 \text{ cm})$  and saturated calomel electrode (SCE) were used as the counter and reference electrode, respectively. The working electrode was a glassy carbon electrode (GCE) with an internal area of 0.07068 cm<sup>2</sup>. Unless otherwise stated, all the applied potential was referenced to the SCE. The test temperature was fixed at room temperature. Before measurements, a GCE was continuously polished with 0.3 and 0.05 µm Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> powders, respectively, and sonicated in distilled water. The ink solution of catalysts was prepared as follows: 2.8 mg of catalysts were dissolved in 1.0 mL of co-solvents of ethanol and water (ethanol: water = 3:1, v:v) and sonicated for 30 min, then 20 µL of Nafion was injected into the ink solution with another 30 min sonication. After that 5 μL of ink solution was dropped on the GCE with a loading amount of 200 µg cm<sup>-2</sup> for all catalysts and dried at room temperature. All electrochemical measurements were carried out in N2-saturated 1.0 M KOH or 1.0 M KOH + 1.0 M ethanol solution between -0.8 and 0.3 V at a scan rate of  $50 \text{ mV s}^{-1}$ .

The electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) of all the nanocatalysts were measured in 1.0 M KOH and calculated from cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves in the area of PdO reduction peaks: ECSA =  $Q_{\rm PdO}/(0.405~{\rm mC~cm^{-2}}\times m_{\rm Pd})$ , where  $Q_{\rm PdO}$  is the charge by integrating the reduction peak area of PdO to Pd, 0.405 mC cm<sup>-2</sup> is the charge required for the reduction of the PdO monolayer, and  $m_{\rm Pd}$  is the mass of Pd (based on ICP-AES analysis, Table S1†) on the working electrode.<sup>39</sup>

The CO stripping experiments were carried out in a 1.0 M KOH solution. Before the tests, CO was bubbled into the  $N_2$ -saturated solution for 20 min at a potential of -0.6 V. Then, high-purity  $N_2$  was bubbled into the CO-saturated electrolyte for 20 min to eliminate the dissolved CO in the electrolyte. <sup>39,40</sup> The CO stripping curves were recorded using CV between -0.8 and 0.3 V at a scan rate of 50 mV s<sup>-1</sup>.

#### Preparation and characterizations of PdAuCu NPs-1

First of all, to determine the desired blackberry-like structure and composition, PdAuCu NPs-1 was investigated in detail as a representative nanoparticle. As shown in Fig. 1a, the typical low-magnification TEM images of PdAuCu NPs-1 exhibited a well-defined blackberry-like structure. The SEM image of PdAuCu NPs-1 was also obtained as shown in Fig. S1a.† Although the sample is too small to further obtain the clear high-magnification due to the limitation of equipment, the size of about 40 nm and anisotropically raised structures of the PdAuCu NPs-1 are still visible. According to the size distribution from over 200 samples, the average diameter of PdAuCu NPs-1 was about 48 nm (Fig. S1b†). High-magnification TEM of PdAuCu NPs-1 from Fig. 1e also clearly showed an irregular blackberry-like morphology, which would provide more active sites during the (electro)catalysis due to the anisotropic structure on the surface. 35,36

For composition analysis of PdAuCu NPs-1, high-resolution TEM (HRTEM), high-angle annular dark-field scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM) and EDX were performed. The crystal structure of PdAuCu NPs-1 was further determined by XRD. As shown in

Fig. 1 (a) Low-magnification TEM image, (b) spectra of the wide-angle XRD pattern, (c) high-magnification TEM image, (d) corresponding HRTEM image in (c) and (e) HAADF-STEM image (EDX line scan inset) and (f) corresponding EDX mapping images of PdAuCu NPs-1.

Fig. 1b, PdAuCu NPs-1 presented five typical diffraction peaks in the  $2\theta$  range of 30–90° corresponding to the (111), (200), (220), (311) and (222) plane of a crystalline-pure fcc structure. In detail, the (111) and (200) diffraction peaks of PdAuCu NPs-1 were respectively located at 38.24° and 44.45°. It is noteworthy that the (111) and (200) diffraction peaks of PdAuCu NPs-1 slightly shifted toward a higher degree and located between pure Pd, Au and Cu (Pd: PDF#46-1043, Au: PDF#89-3697 and Cu: PDF#04-083), indicating the formation of the trimetallic PdAuCu alloy. Such a diffraction peak upshift revealed the lattice contraction owing to the smaller Pd (or Cu) atoms incorporated into the Au (or Pd) fcc lattice, which can result in the geometric effect, increasing the surface strain and active site density of nanocatalysts. 23,35 From the HRTEM micrograph (Fig. 1d), a series of lattice fringes with d-spacing values of 2.32 and 2.25 Å were observed, just between that of Au (2.36 Å) and Pd (2.24 Å), which corresponded to the (111) plane of the PdAu alloy.41 In addition, a d-spacing of 2.13 Å was also observed (Fig. S1c and d†), owing to the incorporation of Cu and Au into the Pd lattice, which further indicated the formation of the PdAuCu alloy. 42 The HAADF-STEM image and corresponding EDX results (Fig. 1e, f and Fig. S2†) illustrated the exact composition of the PdAuCu alloy NPs. The EDX scan line (Fig. 1e inset) and EDX spectrum (Fig. S2†) further confirmed the existence of Pd, Au and Cu elements with an atomic ratio of 5:2:1 (Au: Cu: Pd) on the surface of PdAuCu NPs-1. It could also be obviously found in Fig. 1f that Pd (cyan signal), Au (yellow signal) and Cu (red signal) evenly distributed over the nanoparticles, which further demonstrated the ternary nanoalloy structure of PdAuCu NPs-1.<sup>29</sup> Overall, the above characterization verified successful fabrication of PdAuCu NPs-1 with irregular blackberry-like structures and ternary alloy composition.

XPS analysis was used to investigate the surface composition and the electronic structure of PdAuCu NPs-1. The XPS wide scans (Fig. 2a) confirmed that the dominant peaks

Nanoscale Paper

at 84, 335, and 931.5 eV respectively corresponded to Au, Pd, and Cu, indicating the formation of ternary nanocatalysts. From the high-resolution XPS analysis (Fig. 2b), the Pd 3d spectra of PdAuCu NPs-1 showed two peaks that could be assigned to the Pd  $3d_{5/2}$  and Pd  $3d_{3/2}$  states, and be further split into two doublets, associated with Pd<sup>0</sup> and Pd<sup>2+</sup> chemical states. Similarly, the Cu 2p could be split into two doublets (Cu 2p<sub>1/2</sub> and 2p<sub>3/2</sub>), associated with Cu<sup>0</sup> and Cu<sup>2+</sup>, respectively (Fig. 2d). Furthermore, an additional satellite peak appeared at 943.4 eV as shown in Fig. 2d, which could be attributed to amorphous CuO.43 As a control, the XPS results of PdAu NPs in Fig. S3† with two characteristic peaks at 335.0 and 83.9 eV were obtained, which matched well with Pd  $3d_{5/2}$  and Au  $4f_{7/2}$  of the PdAu alloy respectively.<sup>44</sup> By further fitting the Pd 3d peak into Pd<sup>0</sup> and Pd<sup>2+</sup> (Fig. 2b), it was found that the Pd 3d peak shifted toward the more negative binding energy, compared to that of PdAu NPs (Fig. S3b†). For instance, the Pd 3d<sub>5/2</sub> peaks of PdAuCu NPs-1 and PdAu NPs were located at 334.8 and 335.0 eV, respectively, indicating the downshift of the d-band center of Pd. The possible reasons are the strong electronic interaction between Pd, Au and Cu on the surface of PdAuCu NPs-1, which would facilitate electron transfer from Cu to Pd and Au, and Pd to Au due to the difference in electronegativity (1.90 for Cu, 2.20 for Pd and 2.54 for Au, Pauling scale). 41,45 The electrons transfer from a metallic atom of low electronegativity to a higher one;25,45 hence, the electrons would transfer from Cu to Au or Pd, and from Pd to Au. In principle, the upshift of the Pd 3d peak can be observed in highresolution XPS spectra owing to the electron transfer from Cu to Pd when doping Cu into the PdAu alloy (comparing Fig. 2b with Fig. S3b†). However, no upshift of the Pd 3d peak was observed in high-resolution XPS spectra, because the electronegativity of the Au atom is so negative and the content of Au was so much that lead the electron transfer from Cu and Pd toward Au, which blocked the upshift signal of electron transfer from Cu to Pd. To characterize the electronic interaction between Cu and Pd in the PdAuCu alloy, the ratio of surface Pd<sup>0</sup> to Pd<sup>2+</sup> was also determined by comparing their relative peak areas. The comparison of Pd<sup>0</sup>/Pd<sup>2+</sup> ratios (Table S2†) reveals that the PdAuCu NPs-1 (2.12) have less Pd in the oxidation state than the PdAu NPs (0.89), which indirectly supported the electron transfer from Cu to Pd. 45 The high ratio of Pd<sup>0</sup>/Pd<sup>2+</sup> can increase the number of free Pd sites of the PdAuCu NPs, improving the catalytic properties for more contact opportunities between reactant molecules and free Pd sites. Thus, the dilution of Pd by Au and Cu can suppress the Pd oxidation and improve its stability in the air and provide more Pd<sup>0</sup> to catalyze the EOR.<sup>24</sup> On the other hand, the incorporation of Cu into Pd would lead to the lattice contraction of Pd due to the smaller lattice parameters of Cu than Pd. The electron transfer and shrunk lattice change the work function of Pd and further lead to the downshift of the d-band center, which is beneficial for the EOR because it could weaken the adsorption of intermediates in a modest manner.46

## 3.2. The electrooxidation performance of PdAuCu NPs-1 for the EOR

To further understand the superior catalytic activity of ternary nanoparticles for the EOR, PdAuCu NPs-1, corresponding bimetallic nanoparticles (PdAu, PdCu, and AuCu NPs) and commercial Pd black (Pd/C, as a control) were investigated. Before commencing the study, the PdAu, PdCu, and AuCu NPs were prepared using the same method by preparing PdAuCu NPs-1 in the absence of Cu, Au and Pd precursors, respectively. The TEM and EDX mapping results demonstrated that blackberry-like PdAu NPs and irregular AuCu NPs were successfully prepared (Fig. S4 and S5†). PdCu nanospheres with small size were also produced and confirmed by TEM, HRTEM and XRD analyses (Fig. S6†). The AuCu NPs exhibited no catalytic activity for the EOR (Fig. S7†) due to the lack of Pd active sites;<sup>2,4</sup> therefore, it would not be further mentioned in later discussion.

As shown in Fig. 3a, the quintessential cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of PdAuCu NPs-1, PdAu, PdCu, AuCu NPs and Pd/C were collected in N<sub>2</sub>-saturated 1.0 M KOH. Typically, there are two oxidation peaks in the forward scan (from -0.7 to -0.4 V and -0.3 to 0 V) and one reduction peak (from -0.5 to -0.1 V) in the backward scan. According to the different electrochemical processes that occurred on the surface of the nanocatalysts, the first oxidation peak was ascribed to the electrochemical adsorption of negatively charged OH<sup>-</sup> on the Pdbased catalysts to form Pd-OH<sub>ads</sub>, while the second oxidation peak was attributed to the further oxidation of Pd-OH<sub>ads</sub> with another OH<sup>-</sup> into Pd-O.<sup>22,33</sup> In contrast, the reduction peaks corresponded to the electrochemical reduction on Pd-O into metallic Pd. A higher value of ECSA indicates more accessible active sites and better catalytic performance for the ethanol

**Fig. 3** (a) CV curves and (b) summarized ECSA values of PdAuCu NPs-1, AuPd NPs, PdCu NPs and Pd/C in 1.0 M KOH. (c) CV curves (d) summarized mass activities of PdAuCu NPs-1, AuPd NPs, PdCu NPs and Pd/C in 1.0 M KOH and 1.0 M ethanol solution.

electrooxidation. 16,29 Hence, the ECSAs were calculated based on the reduction peak area. 32,43 The results obtained from the preliminary analyses of ECSAs are shown in Fig. 3b. The ECSA value of PdAu NPs (27.36 m<sup>2</sup> g<sub>Pd</sub><sup>-1</sup>) is much higher than that of PdCu NPs (4.24 m<sup>2</sup> g<sub>Pd</sub><sup>-1</sup>), indicating that the raised structure of blackberry-like PdAu NPs provide more active sites than that of PdCu NPs. Nevertheless, the ESCA value of PdAu NPs is still much lower than that of PdAuCu NPs-1 (125.56 m<sup>2</sup> g<sub>Pd</sub><sup>-1</sup>), which confirmed that the Cu doped in PdAu NPS could further increase the active sites of Pd-based nanoctalysts.35,43 Specifically, in comparison with Pd/C (26.06 m $^2$  g<sub>Pd</sub> $^{-1}$ ) and PdAuCu NPs-1, the incorporation of Au and Cu into Pd-based nanocatalysts enlarged the first oxidation peak and reduction peak (Fig. 3a). This implies that the alloyed structure of PdAuCu NPs-1 facilitated the electrochemical adsorption of OH<sub>ads</sub> and reduction of Pd-O on the nanocatalysts, thus would enhance the catalytic performance for the EOR.

Electrocatalytic performance of Pd-based nanocatalysts as shown in Fig. 3a for the EOR was evaluated in 1.0 M KOH and 1.0 M ethanol, and the results were normalized to the Pd mass based on ICP-AES (Table S1†). Two obvious signals are observed in Fig. 3c, in which the peak in the forwarding scan is assigned to the electrochemical oxidation of ethanol into intermediates (\*CH<sub>3</sub>CO) and their decomposition products (\*CO and \*CH<sub>3</sub>), while the peak in the backward scan was attributed to the further oxidation/removal of the above intermediates. 17,25,45 The mass activity of Pd-based nanocatalysts in Fig. 3c was then summarized based on the oxidation peaks in the forward scans (Fig. 3d).<sup>7,31</sup> The PdAuCu NPs-1 (4457 mA  ${\rm mg_{Pd}}^{-1}$ ) and PdAu NPs (1937 mA mg<sub>Pd</sub><sup>-1</sup>) showed higher mass activity, which was approximately 5 and 2 folds higher than that of Pd/C (846 mA mg<sub>Pd</sub><sup>-1</sup>) respectively. Compared to PdAu NPs and Pd/C, alloying Pd and Au together significantly facilitates the catalytic activity because of the electronic interaction on the surface of nanocatalysts. 24,35 In the same way, doping Cu into PdAu NPs to form PdAuCu NPs further enhanced the mass activity. XPS analysis provided convincing evidence about the change of the electron structure on the surface of nanocatalysts. The Pd 3d<sub>5/2</sub> peak of PdAuCu NPs-1 NPs (34.8 eV) negatively shifted compared with that of PdAu NPs (34.9 eV, see in Fig. S3b†), suggesting the downshift of the d-band center of Pd, thus enhancing the tolerance for CO-like poisoning intermediates. 16,29 Moreover, the Pd0/Pd2+ ratios of the former (2.12) were about 2.5 times that of the latter (0.89). More Pd in the metallic state and stronger electronic interactions on the surface of PdAuCu-NPs-1 might accelerate the EOR.<sup>24</sup> However, the mass activity of PdCu NPs was much lower than that of PdAuCu NPs-1, PdAu NPs and even Pd/C (Fig. 3d). The possible reason is that the PVP as a stabilizer wrapped around PdCu NPs, preventing the interaction between ethanol and nanocatalysts. Another possible reason is that the low Pd<sup>0</sup>/Pd<sup>2+</sup> ratio of PdCu NPs (0.48, see in Fig. S8†) resulted in its weak activity.

#### 3.3. Characterization studies of PdAuCu NPs with tunable Pd contents

Elemental composition ratios of trimetallic alloys are strongly responsible for their (electro)catalytic performance. 30,35 Thus,

various trimetallic PdAuCu NPs with different Pd contents (Pd is the active site for the EOR) were synthesized using the onepot method by varying the amount of Pd precursors (0.1, 0.5, 2, and 3 mL of 20 mM K<sub>2</sub>PdCl<sub>4</sub>, respectively). The corresponding PdAuCu NPs-0.1, 0.5, 2 and 3 with mass percentages of 1.6%, 2.5%, 17.3% and 22.3% (Table S1†), respectively, were produced.

As shown in Fig. 4a-d, the blackberry-like structure of the nanoparticles (PdAuCu NPs-0.1 and 0.5) was obtained at a low addition of Pd precursors. However, when the addition of the K<sub>2</sub>PdCl<sub>4</sub> amount is more than 2 mL during the preparation,

the satellite structure was formed (Fig. 4e-h). The SEM images obtained as shown in Fig. S9† further confirmed the morphology of PdAuCu NPs-0.1, 0.5, 2 and 3. Fig. S9a† and b showed the anisotropic structure for PdAuCu NPs-0.1, 0.5, and Fig. S9c and d† showed the satellite structure for PdAuCu NPs-2 and 3, respectively, which are in agreement with that of TEM results. Interestingly, the average diameters of these nanoparticles were from 37 nm to 48 nm (Fig. S9†). The formation of different structures and similar sizes for PdAuCu NPs was dominated by the kinetics of the precursor's reduction in solution, which are extremely similar to our previous works. 41 In detail, at the low addition of Pd precursors, KAuCl<sub>4</sub> was reduced as the Au core firstly, then the remaining metal salts were co-reduced to form the PdAuCu alloy on the surface. Nevertheless, at the high Pd feeding, the satellite structures were observed (Fig. 4e-h). It could be presumed that the redundant K<sub>2</sub>PdCl<sub>4</sub> was reduced to form Pd nanoparticles and surrounding around the as-formed PdAuCu alloy, in which the more Pd feeding resulted in the more surrounding Pd nanosatellites. In addition, PdAu NPs (Fig. S4†) and PdCu NPs (Fig. S6†) were used to illustrate the effect of the Cu or Au content on the morphology of catalysts. The PdAu NPs exhibited a raised structure on the surface and performed a blackberry-like morphology, which indicated that Cu has no obvious effect on the morphology of PdAuCu NPs. However, small and spherical PdCu NPs were obtained with the lack of the Au element, which implied that Au served as the skeleton

As shown in Fig. 4b and d, at the low Pd feeding, the Pd (cyan spots), Au (yellow spots) and Cu (red spots) signals located uniformly on the surface of the particles indicate the trimetallic nanostructure. However, with the addition of more Pd precursors, stronger Pd signals around the NPs were observed due to the formation of the Pd-satellite structure (Fig. 4f and h), which would confirm our above assumption. According to the EDX spectra (Fig. S11†) and elemental analysis (table in Fig. S11†), the Pd contents of PdAuCu NPs were gradually increased with the increased Pd feeding, which was roughly consistent with the ICP-AES results in Table S1.† Therefore, a conclusion can be drawn that the tunable trimetallic PdAuCu NPs were fabricated to form a blackberry-like structure at low Pd feeding and Pd-satellite surrounded the structure at high Pd feeding through our one-pot synthetic strategy.

for PdAuCu NPs and provided the anisotropic and irregular

Wide-angle XRD patterns could clearly demonstrate the structural and compositional evolution along with the continuous increase of the K<sub>2</sub>PdCl<sub>4</sub> amounts. Each pattern exhibited five diffraction peaks, which can be indexed to diffraction from the (111), (200), (220), (311) and (222) plane of the fcc structure of Au, Pd and Cu (Fig. 5a). In addition, the PdAuCu NPs-0.1 and 0.5 show a major peak at 38.2°, which match well with fcc Au (PDF#89-3697) in Fig. 5b at low Pd feeding. However, with addition of more Pd precursors, the diffraction peaks of PdAuCu NPs-1, 2 and 3 shifted to a higher angle. The single sets of (111) were observed at 38.3° and 38.4° between

that of Au (38.2°), Pd (40.1°) and Cu (43.3°), indicating the incorporation of more Pd into Au. 41 It was in accordance with the shrinkage of the lattice parameter and confirmed the formation of the PdAuCu alloy. 43 The further characterization of PdAuCu NPs-0.1, 0.5, 2 and 3 provided clear views of lattice planes (Fig. S10†). It was worth noting that inter-planar spaces of 2.27 and 2.32 Å were observed in PdAuCu NPs-0.1 and 0.5 respectively, which located between that of Au (2.36 Å) and Pd (2.24 Å) and corresponded to the (111) plane of the PdAuCu alloy (Fig. S10a-f†).35,41 The inter-planar spaces of 2.24 (Pd (111)) and 1.95 Å (Pd (200)) were just detected in the satellites of PdAuCu NPs-2 and 3 (Fig. S10g-i†), suggesting Pd satellites surrounding around the PdAuCu NPs-1 and 2 at high Pd addition. Besides, the diffraction peaks of the PdAu NPs and commercial Pd/C are also shown in Fig. 5a to further illustrate the structure of PdAuCu NPs. As was expected, the characteristic diffraction peaks of commercial Pd/C located at 40.1° and 46.6°, which can be assigned to the Pd (111) and Pd (200) respectively.<sup>23</sup> As shown in Fig. 5b, a weak peak of PdAu NPs appeared at 39.9°, which slightly down-shifted 0.2 degree compared to that of Pd/C, owing to the incorporation of Pd into Au. Therefore, XRD pattern peaks further demonstrated the formation of trimetallic PdAuCu NPs. 35,43

XPS tests were also performed on PdAuCu NPs-0.1, 0.5, 2 and 3, to examine the electronic and surface structure. According to the full scan spectra in Fig. 5c, the PdAuCu NPs-0.1 to 3 were mainly composed of Pd, Au and Cu within the near-surface region, further indicating the ternary composition of PdAuCu NPs. The high-resolution XPS spectra of Pd 3d are shown in Fig. 5d, which contained the spin-orbit splitting of  $3d_{3/2}$  and  $3d_{5/2}$ . The Pd  $3d_{5/2}$  binding energy of PdAu NPs was

located at approximately 335.0 eV as a control. Different from the negative shift of PdAuCu NPs-1 (discussed in section 3.1), the Pd 3d<sub>5/2</sub> peak of PdAuCu NPs-0.1 slightly shifted toward a higher binding energy of 335.2 eV, in comparison with that of PdAu NPs (335.0 eV). The possible reason is that there is Pd doping in PdAuCu NPs-0.1 and thus all electrons preferred to transfer from Pd and Cu to Au, rather than from Cu to Pd, due to the difference in electronegativity. The positive shift of PdAuCu NPs-0.1 in binding energy verified the existence of the induced electronic interaction (electron effect) between Pd, Au and Cu. $^{47-49}$  For PdAuCu NPs-0.5 to 3, the peaks of Pd  $3d_{5/2}$ negatively shifted further away with the increase of the Pd content. It could be ascribed to the modification on the electronic structure of Pd (partial electron transfer from Cu to Pd).<sup>30</sup> The increasing ratios of Pd<sup>0</sup>/Pd<sup>2+</sup> from PdAuCu NPs-0.5 to 3 as shown in Table S2† also confirmed electron transfer from Cu to Pd. The negative shift of Pd 3d<sub>5/3</sub> indicated the downshift of the d-band center that would decrease the adsorption interaction of the O-containing species on PdAuCu NPs. 50-52 A suitable downshift of the d-band center of Pd is beneficial for the EOR because it would weaken the adsorption of both reactants and intermediates in a modest manner. 4,20,46 Considering the opposite surface electronic effect of PdAuCu NPs, rationally engineering the PdAuCu NPs with a suitable compositional ratio would optimize the electronic states and the adsorption feature of the catalytic intermediates, thus accelerating the catalytic performance.

## 3.4. Electrocatalytic EOR performance of PdAuCu NPs with tunable Pd contents

The successful synthesis of trimetallic PdAuCu NPs provided a direct possibility to solidly understand compositional and structural features toward the EOR. Before electrocatalytic EOR studies, the samples were tested in N2-saturated 1.0 M KOH to reveal the ECSAs (Fig. 6a). The ECSA values of PdAuCu NPs are summarized in Fig. 6b with a "volcano"-type trend. The ECSA values of well-alloyed PdAuCu NPs-0.1, 0.5 and 1 were significantly larger than those of satellite-like PdAuCu NPs-2 and 3, suggesting a decrease in electrocatalytic active sites on Pd-satellite structure PdAuCu NPs with the increasing Pd content. The blackberry-like PdAuCu NPs-0.1, 0.5 and 1 provide many edge sites due to the raised and anisotropic structure, resulting in more abundant and active sites.31 Furthermore, the alloyed structure facilitated the electrochemical adsorption of OHads and reduction of Pd-O owing to the strong electron interaction between well-incorporated Pd, Au and Cu. However, ECSA values of PdAuCu NPs-3 are lower than those of PdAuCu NPs-2 and even than those of commercial Pd/C (as a control), which might result from the excess of Pd NPs surrounding the PdAuCu NPs, blocking the exposure of internal active sites of Pd. It is noteworthy that the Pd content plays a key role in the optimization of the structure to achieve the most desired results for ECSA. Thus, only at rational composition (PdAuCu NPs-0.5), the stronger electronic interaction and the better anisotropic structure of PduCu NPs could be

obtained to enhance the active site, which also provides a general guideline for later discussion.

Electrocatalytic EOR performance of PdAuCu NPs with different Pd contents was evaluated in 1.0 M KOH and 1.0 M ethanol solution. CV curves changed after the addition of ethanol (Fig. 6c), in comparison with that in 1.0 M KOH (Fig. 6a). The mass activities of PdAuCu NPs-0.1 to 3 and commercial Pd/C are summarized in Fig. 6d. Overall, PdAuCu NPs-(0.1 to 2) with different Pd contents exhibited excellent mass activities, which were approximately 4-25 folds higher than that of commercial Pd/C. Meanwhile, it was easily noticed that an obvious "volcano"-type mass activity of PdAuCu NPs versus the Pd content was displayed, which matched well with the results of ESCAs, evidencing the compositional effect of PdAuCu NPs in the EOR. Among them, the PdAuCu NPs-0.5 achieved the highest mass activity of 22 997 mA mg<sub>Pd</sub><sup>-1</sup>, which is about 2.5 folds higher than that of PdAuCu NPs-0.1 and even more 2 times higher than that of the highest Pd-based nanocatalysts in previous literature studies (Table S3†), because the great adsorption of Au and Cu towards O-related species (for example, OH-) might accelerate the removal of poisoning intermediates during the EOR. 22,23,46 It was worth mentioning that PdAuCu NPs-3 performed the lowest catalytic

Nanoscale

activity due to the excess Pd NPs surrounding the alloyed core, which attenuated the tolerance towards CO-like intermediates. On the other hand, the mass activity of bimetallic PdAu NPs (1937 mA mg<sub>Pd</sub><sup>-1</sup>, in Fig. 3d) was also higher than that of PdAuCu NPs-3 and Pd/C, but much lower than alloyed PdAuCu NPs-(0.1, 0.5 and 1), which suggests that the suitable incorporation of the second or third metal did facilitate the EOR. Furthermore, as observed in Fig. 6e, a notable specific activity (current normalized by ECSA) of 10.61 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> was attained on PdAuCu NPs-0.5, which shows a similar tendency compared to that by mass activity. Several above-mentioned results pointed to the same direction that the trimetallic alloyed structure and a reasonable Pd content of Pd-based nanocatalysts can significantly accelerate the activity in the EOR. Moreover, although most of the active sites were from Pd, the unique structure provided by Au and the enhanced electronic interaction between Pd, Au and Cu, both contributed to acceleration of the EOR. However, the same as the effect of the Pd content discussed above, the performance of the catalysts might be changed within a reasonable range of the Au and Cu content. Considering the combined effect of element composition, a reasonable Pd content is a key factor to determine the catalytic activity, and the Au or Cu just was used as the cofactor in facilitating the performance of catalysts. Successful incorporation of Au and Cu into Pd-based nanoparticles provided a direct opportunity to comprehensively unveil the balance between composition and surface structure of PdAuCu NPs

towards the electrocatalytic EOR.

Stability is another important concern for the development of electrocatalysts. Therefore, chronoamperometry measurements at a fixed potential of -0.23 V were carried out to compare the durability of these nanocatalysts (Fig. 6f). PdAuCu NPs-0.5 exhibited the slowest loss in mass activities in the initial 1500 s, while commercial Pd/C or PdAuCu NPs-3 showed the faster loss. After electrocatalysis for 3600 s, PdAuCu NPs-0.5 retained mass activities of other nanocatalysts were observed around 200 mA mg<sub>Pd</sub><sup>-1</sup> at 3600 s. Additionally, the chronoamperometric stability of most EOR electrocatalysts is much inferior to their corresponding cycling stability because they are more prone to be poisoned by carbonaceous intermediates during continuous EOR electrocatalysis.<sup>53</sup> Therefore, the stability of PdAuCu NPs-0.1 to 3 was also investigated by the long-time CV sweep for 1300 cycles (Fig. S13†), and the current density of the forwarding peaks from CVs is shown in Fig. S14.† Initially, the peak current density increased and then gradually decreased with the increase of the scan numbers which is in agreement with previous literature studies. 53,54 The peak current densities of mass activity per mg Pd at 1300th scan are 3624, 14130, 912, 1025, 78 and 329 mA mg<sub>Pd</sub><sup>-1</sup> for PdAuCu NPs-0.1 to 3 and Pd/C, respectively. These current densities are lower than their corresponding maximum current densities by 65%, 43%, 79% 73%, 68% and 59%, respectively. It worth highlighting that both cycling stability and chronoamperometric stability tests of PdAuCu NPs-0.5 still exhibited a strong mass activity at the end of cycles. The enhanced stability of PdAuCu NPs-0.5 might

be attributed to the blackberry-like morphology and the PdAuCu alloyed structure, 53,55,56 in which the oxophilic Au and Cu atoms dispersed around the Pd weakened the adsorption of CO-like species on Pd active sites. 23,43

The charge transfer kinetic behaviour of the EOR can be examined by the Tafel plot curves derived from linear scan voltammograms (LSV, shown in Fig. 7a).<sup>20</sup> According to the Tafel equation, the values of Tafel slopes were calculated in the lower potential region (-0.75 to -0.45 V), where the adsorption of hydroxyl was taken place (Fig. 7b).<sup>57</sup> The Tafel slopes increased in the order of PdAuCu NPs-0.5 < PdAuCu NPs-0.1 < PdAuCu NPs-1 < AuPd NPs < PdAuCu NPs-2 < PdAuCu NPs-3 < Pd/C. The low value of Tafel slopes implied that the charge transfer kinetics of OH adsorption on the PdAuCu NPs-0.5 catalysts was the fastest in the alkaline medium. 54,57 Apparently, Tafel slopes diminished significantly in the presence of Au (comparing PdAu NPs with Pd/C) and Cu (comparing PdAuCu NPs-0.1, 0.5 and 1 with PdAu NPs). The electron effect induced by Au and Cu was conducive to generating oxygenated species (e.g. -OHads) at lower potential, thus favouring the catalytic oxidation of intermediate reaction products that adsorbed on the Pd active sites. 20,43 The results demonstrated that the introduction of Au and Cu can observably accelerate the charge-transfer kinetics for the EOR.43 It also proved that the PdAuCu NPs with optimized Pd content (PdAuCu NPs-0.5) possessed the highest electrocatalytic oxidation rate for the EOR among all the tested catalysts because of the fast charge transfer kinetic.

To further clarify the promoting effect of activation on the electrocatalytic activity toward the EOR, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was also performed at -0.3 V in the frequency range of  $10^5$ – $10^{-1}$  Hz to investigate the electro-oxidation reaction kinetic, and the corresponding Nyquist plots are presented in Fig. 7c. Based on the impedance, the equi-

valent circuit shown in Fig. 7d was used to fit the EIS data. The constant-phase element (CPE) is the double-layer capacitance. C1 and R1 represent the capacitance and resistance of electrooxidation of the adsorbed intermediates.  $R_s$  and  $R_{CT}$  are the solution resistance and charge transfer resistance, respectively. The smaller the value of  $R_{CT}$ , the faster the charge transfer is for the proceeding of the electrochemical reaction, implying that a superior catalytic performance is acquired on the catalyst surface. 58 Herein, the  $R_{\rm CT}$  value of all the catalysts from the equivalent circuit increases as the order of PdAuCu NPs- $0.5 (0.1700 \Omega \text{ cm}^2) < PdAuCu NPs-0.1 (0.1817 \Omega \text{ cm}^2) <$ PdAuCu NPs-1 (0.2205  $\Omega$  cm<sup>2</sup>) < PdAuCu NPs-2 (0.2780  $\Omega$  cm<sup>2</sup>) < PdAu NPs  $(0.2755 \Omega \text{ cm}^2) <$  Pd/C  $(0.5870 \Omega \text{ cm}^2) <$  PdAuCu NPs-3 (0.8278  $\Omega$  cm<sup>2</sup>), which was in great agreement with the activity sequence above and the best performance was obtained on the PdAuCu NPs-0.5. The  $R_{\rm CT}$  values clearly revealed that the charge transfer resistance of PdAuCu NPs-0.5 was the lowest compared to that of the other catalysts. The rational dispersion of Pd by doping Au and Cu atoms enhances the electron transfer which behaved as free electroacadsorption and prevented adsorption. 59,60 In addition, the OH group on the catalysts promotes the oxidation kinetics, thus lowering the charge transfer resistance. Consequently, the optimized Pd content of PdAuCu NPs (PdAuCu NPs-0.5) would overcome the chargetransfer resistances, thus accelerating the charge-transfer rates during the EOR.

The CO-like intermediate products are an essential reason resulting in catalyst toxicosis for the EOR. 23,40 Therefore, compositional effects of ternary PdAuCu NPs towards the removal poisoning carbonaceous intermediates are directly mimicked by CO anti-poisoning tests. As illustrated in Fig. 8, the adsorbed CO on the catalysts was almost eliminated by two consecutive CV scans. In comparison with the bimetallic PdAu NPs, it was clear that alloying Cu into PdAu NPs decreased the onset potential from -0.14 (PdAu NPs) to -0.33 V (PdAuCu NPs-0.5) and even lower than commercial Pd/C, indicating that PdAuCu NPs-0.5 has an excellent CO removal ability.<sup>55,61</sup> Likewise, larger active areas of CO oxidation/removal peaks are achieved by trimetallic PdAuCu NPs-0.1, 0.5 and 1. Among all of the PdAuCu NPs with different Pd compositional ratios, PdAuCu NPs-0.5 exhibited the largest active areas. The above results strongly implied that intermediary CO-like species can be relatively easily removed and oxidized with the incorporation of oxophilic Au and Cu leading to improved catalyst CO anti-poisoning duration. In brief, the PdAuCu NPs-0.5 showed excellent stability and CO-poisoning tolerance for the EOR.

On account of the results of electrochemical measurements, the PdAuCu NPs-0.5 exhibited an improved catalytic activity and excellent stability for the EOR. The superior electrocatalytic activity of the proposed catalysts can achieve the best performance for electrochemically active surface area, charge transfer resistance and stability or CO-poisoning tolerance, which may be mainly ascribed to its unique structure and suitable Pd content. The possible reasons are listed as follows: (1) the raised structure of blackberry-like PdAuCu NPs-0.5 pro-

vided a large active surface area and abundant edge sites, which are more active for the catalytic reaction compared to corner or other active sites.31 (2) The fact that Pd dispersed by Au and Cu atoms enhanced the electron transfer effect prevented the intermediate adsorption and behaved as more free Pd electroactive adsorption sites that could favor C-H cleavage owing to the shift in the d-band center. 23,62 In addition, the easy adsorption of catalysts for OH- benefited the oxidation kinetics, thus lowering the charge transfer resistance. 60 (3) The bearing of high oxidation current by the PdAuCu NPs-0.5 catalysts might from the oxophilic Au and Cu atoms be dispersed around the Pd, which weakened the adsorption strength of CO-like species on Pd active sites. 23,43 Au and Cu also could act as potential electrocatalysts for CO oxidation in alkaline media since it could readily activate water forming Au-OHads (or Cu-OHads) at relatively low potential by the following reaction<sup>63</sup> (using Au as an example, the same as Cu): CO<sub>ads</sub> + Au- $OH_{ads} \rightarrow Au-CO-OH \rightarrow Au-COOH \rightarrow Au + CO_2 + H_2O$ . The Pd acted as primary active sites for catalyzing the dehydrogenation of ethanol and CO-like intermediate species could be oxidized by the surface oxide of Au and Cu to produce CO2 or other products, subsequently releasing the active sites.<sup>59</sup> Taken together, the surface structure and composition of PdAuCu NPs play a critical role in accelerating the activity for the EOR. The unique structure of blackberry-like trimetallic PdAuCu alloys (PdAuCu NPs-0.1, 0.5 and 1) provides more active sites and stronger electronic interaction than the coreshell structure (PdAuCu NPs-2 and 3). The effective dispersion of Pd by doping oxophilic Au and Cu with a reasonable compoNanoscale Paper

sition facilitates the electron transfer and CO-poisoning tolerance. Hence, the best optimized catalysts (PdAuCu NPs-0.5) achieved the balance between surface structure and composition and presented the excellent catalytic performance for the EOR.

#### 4. Conclusions

In summary, the blackberry-like trimetallic PdAuCu nanoparticles with tunable Pd contents were prepared by a facile and effective one-pot method in an aqueous solution and further applied to the electrocatalytic EOR. The PdAuCu NPs demonstrated some features as follows: (1) in comparison with the bimetallic (PdAu and PdCu) NPs and commercial Pd/C, incorporation of Pd, Au and Cu together significantly boosted the catalytic performance for the EOR; (2) among a series of PdAuCu NPs with tunable Pd content, PdAuCu NPs-0.5 exhibited the highest catalytic activity with a mass activity of 23.0 A mg<sub>Pd</sub><sup>-1</sup> for the EOR, which is much higher than that of the reported Pd-based catalyst to date; (3) through the Tafel plots, EIS spectroscopy and CO stripping tests, the excellent activity of PdAuCu NPs is not only dependent on the Pd content but also on the surface electron effect. Successful incorporation of Au and Cu into Pd-based nanoparticles offered a direct opportunity to unveil the synergistic effects of PdAuCu toward the electrocatalytic EOR. PdAuCu NPs-0.5, which achieved a balance between Pd content and surface electron structure, can deliver the most favourable catalytic activity toward the EOR. Overall, this blackberry-like nanoalloy structure provides true opportunity to integrate the functions of both electronic effect and geometric effect into unprecedented collective properties, which may result in significant advances not only in catalysis, as demonstrated in this work, but also in photonics, especially plasmonic optics, electrooptics, magnetics and many others.

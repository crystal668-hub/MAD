Transition metal oxides have garnered attention for the methanol electrooxidation reaction owing to their easy availability, high catalytic applicability, and multiple oxidation capabilities. Bimetal-based catalysts further enhance the performance of the methanol oxidation reaction. In this context, a chrysanthemumflower-like MoO<sub>2</sub>/WO<sub>3</sub> is synthesized through a solvothermal and annealing strategy. The morphology attests to the rough surface and pores in the catalyst, augmenting its surface area for reactions and enhancing catalytic applicability. Electrochemical oxidation of methanol yields an optimal current density of  $0.99 \text{ mA cm}^{-2}$  and  $2.07 \text{ mA mg}^{-1}$  at a potential of 0.57 V versus Ag/AgCl. The catalyst exhibits a remarkably low Tafel slope of 37.45 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>, affirming its rapid reaction kinetics. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) reveals an equivalent electronic circuit of R(Q(R(QR)Q(RW))), confirming low charge transfer resistance (Rct) and diffusion-controlled kinetics attributable to the pores in the sample. The sample also demonstrates an electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) value equal to 0.122 mF cm<sup>-2</sup> and long-term stability over continuous 5000 s, exhibiting no change and high resistance to CO poisoning. All these characterizations and obtained results collectively affirm that the chrysanthemumflower-like MoO2/WO3 serves as a highly suitable electrocatalyst for the electrochemical oxidation of methanol.

#### 1. Introduction

The primary objective of recent research projects is to develop sustainable resources for energy with the capability to replace fossil fuels in future energy applications.[1-4] Among the various available alternatives, fuel cells have the potential to achieve recent research goals and overcome energy crises and environmental issues due to their high potential for clean and sustainable power.[5-7] The basic mechanism of a fuel cell is to convert chemical energy, for example, alcohol, into electrical energy with high energy density and efficiency at low temperatures. Among fuel cells, the direct methanol fuel cell (DMFCs), which operates on methanol conversion, is the center of interest due to its lowtemperature operation, simplicity, ease of handling methanol, low carbon emissions for a better environment, high energy density, and portability. [8-10] For DMFCs, the cell function, transport phenomena, and geometric design for optimized performance have been developed in a theoretical

simulation model. However, for the methanol oxidation reaction in energy applications, a catalyst is needed to make the reaction (CH<sub>3</sub>OH + H<sub>2</sub>O = CO<sub>2</sub> + 6 H<sup>+</sup> + 6e<sup>-</sup>) more feasible. Platinum is the state-of-the-art electrocatalyst for this reaction, but its carbon monoxide poisoning, limited source, and very high price are major hurdles in the commercialization of Pt-based electrodes. Therefore, reducing dependency on these noble metal-based electrocatalysts and searching for more efficient, stable, and affordable electrocatalysts is a primary goal for researchers in the current society. The methanology of the metal-based electrocatalysts and searching for more efficient, stable, and affordable electrocatalysts is a primary goal for researchers in the current society.

In this regard, transition metal oxides have gained extensive research attention as suitable and alternative electrocatalysts (to precious metals) for methanol oxidation reactions due to their multiple oxidation states, favorable for high catalytic methanol oxidation applications. [18–20] Several transition metal oxides, such as NiO, [18–21]  $\text{Co}_3\text{O}_4$ , [12]  $\text{TiO}_2$ , [22]  $\text{NiCo}_2\text{O}_4$ , [9,13,23] have been studied for methanol oxidation reactions due to their low cost, high activity, and easy availability. To further improve the catalytic application of transition metal oxides, bimetal oxides are highly recommended compared to single metal oxide catalysts. The high activity of bimetal oxides is attributed to the synergism of two metals, providing a large electronic cloud for the oxidation

reaction, with high stability and low CO poisoning effect.[24] Molybdenum oxide has recently gained attention for methanol oxidation reactions due to its high activity and strong stability. In this regard, Jothi et al.[25] prepared NiMoO4 as an electrocatalyst for methanol oxidation reactions via a hydrothermal strategy. The catalyst's nanorod-like morphology delivered a current density of 49 mA cm-<sup>2</sup> at a potential of 0.45 V versus Hg/HgO in 1 M KOH and 2 M methanol solution. The high performance is attributed to the unique one-dimensional nanorod and combination of bimetal oxide in the same electrocatalyst.

Motivated by literature study and as a continuation of our previous work,[26] this research study applies a solvothermal and annealing method to synthesize chrysanthemum-flowers-like bimetal oxide electrocatalyst for methanol electro-oxidation reactions. The flowers are composed of nanosize petals (particles) with a large number of pores, increasing its surface area for improved catalytic application. The catalyst showed excellent methanol oxidation reactions with high current density at low

potential and excellent stability for long-term usage. The catalyst shows almost negligible poisoning effect toward CO during the reaction. The negligible poisoning and excellent stability and catalytic application can be attributed to the presence of bimetal and unique morphology according to the literature.

## 2. Results and Discussion

The chrysanthemum-flower-like bimetal oxides (MoO2/WO3) based electrocatalyst is prepared through a two-step strategy, employing solvothermal in the first step and annealing methods in the second step. The catalyst is thoroughly characterized using STEM for both SEM and TEM to ascertain the morphology of the sample. The SEM study is depicted in Figure 1, illustrating welldeveloped and uniformly shaped chrysanthemum flowers composed of bimetal oxides. These flowers are well-separated and consist of nanopetals (nanoparticles). The space between the

nanopetals creates three-dimensional pores inside the flower structure. The combination of pores and petals collectively enhances the surface area of the material, providing active sites favorable for high catalytic application. The sample was also studied with EDS, which confirmed the presence of Mo, W, and O in

the sample as shown in the Figure S1, Supporting Information. Further investigation with TEM and high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) characterization is presented in Figure 2. The TEM study confirms the presence of nano-petals arranged in three dimensions with significant space and pores in between. The large pores contribute to increased surface area and facilitate the electrolyte's path, reducing diffusion and controlling diffusion kinetics. However, from the TEM data (Figure 2a-c), it is evident that the petals of the flowers are still dense, requiring additional efforts to make them ultrathin and further improve the surface area and active spots for reactions. The HAADF of the same sample is characterized at the same particle of TEM to confirm the purity of the sample. The consistent appearance of the sample in HAADF confirms that the material is composed of the same components, and there is no impurity in the sample, as shown in Figure 2d-f. The purity and crystallinity of the sample are further studied through X-Ray diffraction (XRD) characterization, as shown in Figure 3. The sample exhibits prominent peaks at 25.96°, 31.07°, 36.62°, 36.87°, 36.96°, 37.20°, 53.01°, 53.40°, 53.77°, 60.19°, 60.43°, and 66.54°, corresponding to hkl values of (011), (-202), (-112), (020), (200), (-312), (022), (112), (031), (013), and (-132). There are a few other, albeit very small, peaks. All these prominent and small peaks align well with ICDD # 78-1071 of MoO2 with a monoclinic crystal unit

(P21/c(14)). Additionally, there are other prominent peaks at 23.20°, 24.11°, 29.02°, and 33.34°, along with multiple smaller peaks, corresponding to (002), (110), (012), and (-112). These peaks are well-matched with ICDD # 87-2376 of WO<sub>3</sub> with a monoclinic crystal (Pc(7)). The crystal information and XRD data collectively confirm the purity of the sample, indicating the presence of W, Mo, and O in the composition. The XRD results also are good aligned with Rietveld refinement as shown in Figure S2, Supporting Information.

The electrochemical application of chrysanthemumflower-like MoO<sub>2</sub>/WO<sub>3</sub> for methanol oxidation reaction was characterized in a three-electrode system connected to an Autolab potentiostat. The electrochemical methanol oxidation reaction study of  $MoO_2/WO_3$  is performed in a 1 M KOH solution with different concentrations of methanol, various scan rates, EIS, and chronoamperometry. The methanol electro-oxidation reaction of MoO<sub>2</sub>/WO<sub>3</sub> is initially studied in a 1 M KOH solution and 0.00-1.00 M of methanol to determine the effect of methanol concentration and optimum concentration, as shown in Figure 4a. MoO<sub>2</sub>/WO<sub>3</sub> in only 1 M KOH solution at a scan rate of 50 mV s<sup>-1</sup> exhibits a peak starting at 0.35 V vs Ag/AgCl and a proper peak at 0.42 V versus Ag/AgCl with a current density of 0.34 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. This peak is attributed to the oxidation of the metal to a higher state, which, on reduction, returns to the original state and shows a peak at  $0.29\,\mathrm{V}$  versus Ag/AgCl. Upon adding low concentrations of methanol (0.25 M) to the system, the oxidation peak shifts to a positive potential with high current density, further increasing in the presence of  $0.50\,\mathrm{M}$  methanol. From Figure 4a, it is evident that the difference in current

density from 0.00 to 0.25 and 0.50 M of methanol is very high. However, this difference for 0.75 and 1.00 M of methanol is less, confirming that 0.50 M is considered the best concentration. At higher concentrations, methanol may be oxidized partially, producing an excess of carbon-based pollutants, especially CO, which is toxic and detrimental to most catalysts. The current density of chrysanthemum-flower-like MoO2/WO3 for the electrochemical oxidation of methanol in 1 M KOH and  $0.50\,\mathrm{M}$  methanol at a scan rate of  $50\,\mathrm{mV}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$  is equal to 0.99 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> at a potential of 0.57 V versus Ag/AgCl. The current density for 0.25, 0.75, and 1.00 M of methanol are equal to 0.66, 1.09, and  $1.15 \,\mathrm{mA \, cm^{-2}}$  at potentials of 0.54, 0.57, and 0.56 V versus Ag/AgCl. To understand and determine the reaction kinetics for methanol oxidation reaction, Tafel equation  $(\eta = b \log j + a)$ , where  $\eta$ , b, j, and a are overpotential, slope, current density, and intercept, respectively) is used to calculate the Tafel slope for each oxidation in different methanol concentrations, as shown in Figure 4b. The Tafel slope for 1 M KOH

solution without methanol is the highest, equal to 42.15 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>. The Tafel slope decreases to 40.01 mV dec<sup>-1</sup> for the electrolyte of 1 M KOH in the presence of 0.25 M methanol, further decreasing to 37.45 for 0.50 M methanol and the same concentration of KOH. With an increase in methanol to 0.75 and 1.00 M, the decrease in Tafel slopes is very slight, giving values of 37.19 and 37.02 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>. This slight change aligns well with the CV study of the sample, confirming that with a further increase in concentration, there is minimal change, thereby supporting the selection of 0.50 M methanol and 1 M KOH as the optimum conditions for the reaction. When an electrocatalyst is dropped on the surface of the electrode, it might agglomerate, reducing the available catalyst surface for reaction. In contrast, the roughness of the electrocatalyst increases its surface area for catalytic application. In this regard, it is highly recommended to study the catalytic application of a catalyst per unit g/mg of the sample. Accordingly, the electrocatalytic methanol oxidation reaction is also studied, determining the current density per unit mg of the sample, as shown in Figure 4c. The oxidation behavior per unit mg is similar to per unit area. However, the current density per unit mg is slightly higher than per unit area, possibly due to the roughness of the sample. The current densities for 0.00,  $0.25, 0.50, 0.75, \text{ and } 1.00 \,\text{M}$  methanol at a scan rate of  $50 \,\text{mV s}^{-1}$ are equal to 0.72, 1.38, 2.07, 2.30, and 2.41 mA mg<sup>-1</sup> at the same potential as recorded for per unit area. The reaction mechanism is discussed in the supporting information.

The chrysanthemum-flower-like MoO2/WO3 based electrocatalyst is investigated with EIS to determine the resistance. The EIS graph is equivalent to R(Q(R(QR)(Q(RW)))), as determined by ZSimpWin software, as shown in Figure 5a and inset. The resistance of the solution between the reference and working electrode is represented with  $R_s$ . The roughness of the catalyst shows non-ideal capacitance, and the related capacitance and resistance are represented with  $Q_1$  and  $R_1$ . The resistance and related non-ideal capacitance of charge transfer, and diffusioninduced Warburg resistance are represented with  $Q_{\rm dl}$ ,  $R_{\rm ct}$ , and W, respectively.  $R_x$  and  $Q_x$  represent the resistance and capacitance produced in the pores of the sample (as SEM and TEM showed that the chrysanthemum-flower-like MoO<sub>2</sub>/WO<sub>3</sub> exhibited pores), as shown in Figure 5a (inset). [27] In Figure 5b, a very small semi-circle represents the  $R_{ct}$ . This small circle and the data from ZSimpWin software confirm, that the  $R_{ct}$  is low, favoring high catalytic application. The EIS data show the existence of small resistance due to the diffusion of electrolyte in the pores of the sample, causing the effect of diffusion control kinetics in materials. This diffusion is not possible on the surface of the electrocatalyst due to the excess amount of electrolyte of KOH and methanol, but the resistance and capacitance created in the pores may cause such effects, as determined in the EIS. Thus, the electrocatalyst in the electrolyte of 1 M KOH and 0.50 M methanol is investigated at different scan rates of 25–100 mV s<sup>-1</sup>. Figure 5c shows that as the scan rate increases,

the peak current density increases and slightly shifts to a positive potential. This increase in current density and shift to a positive potential are signs of diffusion control kinetics, which is confirmed by plotting the log of the scan rate vs the log of current density. The graph of the log of the scan rate vs log current density gives a linear response, where the slope is almost equal to 0.5, as shown in Figure 5d. The calculation confirms that the reaction is diffusion-controlled and is in accordance with the

It is highly recommended to determine the ECSA of the sample. The ECSA of the sample is determined from  $C_{\rm dl}$ , which is calculated from the cyclic voltammetry (CV) recorded at different scan rates of 20–100 mV s<sup>-1</sup>. CV is recorded at scan rates of 20, 40, 60, 80, 100 mV s<sup>-1</sup>, as shown in **Figure 6**a. The scan rate is plotted against the current density J, where the cathodic current is subtracted from the anodic current. The calculation results in a linear graph, and half of the slope is considered as ECSA, which is equal to 0.122 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>, as shown in Figure 6b. This high ECSA of the sample is due to the unique morphology of the MoO<sub>2</sub>/WO<sub>3</sub>, which resembles chrysanthemum flowers with a rough surface and pores, increasing its surface area for electrochemical application. One of the most important phenomena of an electrocatalyst is its stability for long-term use. The electrocatalyst is investigated for long-term stability over 5000 s via chronoamperometric testing at a potential of 0.6 V vs Ag/AgCl. The sample, chrysanthemum-flower-like MoO2/WO3, shows a highly excellent and almost stable response for 5000 s, as shown in Figure 6c. This highly stable response confirms its long-term stability and resistance to CO poisoning. This confirms that chrysanthemum-flower-like MoO2/WO3 is a suitable catalyst for the electrochemical oxidation of methanol. A comparison with previous literature is provided in Table S1, Supporting Information.

#### 3. Conclusion

The primary objective of recent research projects is to develop sustainable resources for energy with the capability to replace fossil fuels in future energy applications. Electrochemical oxidation of methanol is considered an ideal strategy due to its high energy density, ease of handling, portability, and low carbon emission. Platinum-based catalysts are commonly used for methanol oxidation, but their low availability, high cost, and susceptibility to CO poisoning limit their application. In this context, other catalysts, especially transition metal oxides, have garnered attention due to their easy availability, high catalytic application, and multiple oxidation states. The catalytic performance can be further improved with bimetallic catalysts. In this study, a chrysanthemum-flower-like MoO<sub>2</sub>/WO<sub>3</sub> catalyst is synthesized through a solvothermal and annealing strategy. The catalyst exhibits purity and high crystalline features, as confirmed by X-Ray diffraction (XRD). SEM and TEM analyses confirm that the material is composed of nanoparticles/nanopetals arranged in three dimensions, resembling chrysanthemum flowers. The morphology further confirms the rough surface and pores in the catalyst, enhancing its surface area for reactions and improving catalytic application. The electrochemical oxidation of methanol is validated through CV, revealing an optimum current density of  $0.99 \,\mathrm{mA \, cm^{-2}}$  and  $2.07 \,\mathrm{mA \, mg^{-1}}$  at a potential of 0.57 V versus Ag/AgCl. The catalyst displays a very low Tafel slope of 37.45 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>, confirming its fast reaction kinetics. EIS analysis reveals an equivalent electronic circuit R(Q(R(QR)

Q(RW))), confirming low charge transfer resistance ( $R_{ct}$ ) and diffusion control kinetics due to the presence of pores in the sample. This is further corroborated by CV studies at different scan rates, where the log of scan rate is plotted against log current density. The sample also exhibits an ECSA value of 0.122 mF cm<sup>-2</sup> and demonstrates long-term stability over 5000 s, with no observable change and high resistance to CO poisoning. The comprehensive characterization and obtained results confirm that the chrysanthemum-flower-like MoO<sub>2</sub>/

oxidation of methanol.

Ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate  $[(NH_4)_6Mo_7O_{24}\cdot 4H_2O \ge 99\%]$ , sodium wolframate dihydrate [Na<sub>2</sub>WO<sub>4</sub>•2H<sub>2</sub>O  $\geq$  99%], methanol [CH<sub>3</sub>OH > 99.5%], potassium hydroxide [KOH > 85%], sodium hydroxide [NaOH  $\geq$  98%], 1,3-butandiol [C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>10</sub>O<sub>2</sub>  $\geq$  98.8%], and sodium selenite [Na<sub>2</sub>SeO<sub>3</sub>  $\geq$  99%], all chemical were purchased from Sigma-aldrich and used without further purification. Deionized water was used in the experiment, obtained from the Polwater DL-3 purification system.

Synthesis of Chrysanthemum-Flowers-Like Bimetal Oxide Electrocatalyst: The materials are synthesized in two-step protocol, in the first step of the synthesis a simple solvothermal strategy was applied as discussed in our previous work. [26] Typically, 1.2 mmol of (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>6</sub>Mo<sub>7</sub>O<sub>24</sub>•4H<sub>2</sub>O, 0.6 mmol of Na<sub>2</sub>WO<sub>4</sub>•2H<sub>2</sub>O and 0.8 mmol of Na<sub>2</sub>SeO<sub>3</sub> were simultaneously added to 30 mL of 1,3-butan-diol under vigorous stirring. Then, the mixture was transferred to 50 mL of stainless steel Teflon autoclave and heat for 16 h at 180 °C. After cooling down to room temperature, the sample was collected via centrifuge, washed with ethanol and water to remove impurities, and finally dried at 60 °C for overnight. In the next step an annealing strategy with temperature 500 °C was applied for 2 h in the presence of air to finally get MoO<sub>2</sub>/WO<sub>2</sub> electrocatalyst. The catalyst was collected after cooling the oven and store for further characterization and for methanol oxidation reaction.

Electrochemical Study: A three-electrode setup linked with mAutolab potentiostat was utilized for electrochemical applications. Ag/AgCl, Pt rod, and glassy carbon electrode (GCE) were used as reference, auxiliary, and working electrode, respectively. 5 mg of electrocatalyst was dispersed in a mixture of 250  $\mu$ L of ethanol and 750  $\mu$ L of water, and ultrasonicated for 15 min to obtain a homogeneous composition. This freshly-prepared suspension (3 µL) was drop-casted on cleaned GCE surface and left to dry at ambient temperature; subsequently, 2 µL of Nafion was dropped on modified GCE surface and dried. This modified GCE was applied for electrochemical application in an alkaline medium (1 M KOH) with different methanol concentrations (0.25-1 M) at different scan rates (25–100 mV s<sup>-1</sup>) via cyclic voltammetry (CV). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was investigated at frequency range of 0.1-100 kHz, at open circuit potential with AC amplitude of 5 mV. Chronoamperometry was recorded for 5000 s, at potential of 0.6 V vs. Ag/AgCl. CVs were collected in the non-faradic region at scan rates 20–100 mV s<sup>-1</sup> for determination of electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) of the sample.

Characterization: Morphology of the electrocatalyst is confirmed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) via scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) ((HR-SEM, Nova NanoSEM 450, FEI, Hillsboro, OR, USA, equipped with STEM II detector). The sample was also analyzed with energy dispersive spectroscopy ((EDS, EDAX/AMETEK, Materials Analysis Division, Model Octane Super, Mahwah, NJ, USA), to determine its purity and presence of elements. The sample was investigated with X-Ray diffractometer (XRD) (Aeris 1.2.0 (PAN analytical with Cu radiation and PIXcel 1D detector) for purity, phase, and crystallinity.

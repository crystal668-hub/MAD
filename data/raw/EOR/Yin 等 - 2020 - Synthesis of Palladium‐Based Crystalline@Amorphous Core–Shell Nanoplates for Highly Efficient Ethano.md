**Phase engineering of nanomaterials (PEN) offers a promising route to rationally tune the physicochemical properties of nanomaterials and further enhance their performance in various applications. However, it remains a great challenge to construct well-defined crystalline@amorphous core–shell heterostructured nanomaterials with the same chemical components. Herein, the synthesis of binary (Pd-P) crystalline@amorphous heterostructured nanoplates using Cu3−χP nanoplates as templates, via cation exchange, is reported. The obtained nanoplate possesses a crystalline core and an amorphous shell with the same elemental components, referred to as**  *c***-Pd-P@***a***-Pd-P. Moreover, the obtained** *c***-Pd-P@***a***-Pd-P nanoplates can serve as templates to be further alloyed with Ni, forming ternary (Pd-Ni-P) crystalline@amorphous heterostructured nanoplates, referred to as**  *c***-Pd-Ni-P@***a***-Pd-Ni-P. The atomic content of Ni in the** *c***-Pd-Ni-P@***a***-Pd-Ni-P nanoplates can be tuned in the range from 9.47 to 38.61 at%. When used as a catalyst, the** *c***-Pd-Ni-P@***a***-Pd-Ni-P nanoplates with 9.47 at% Ni exhibit excellent electrocatalytic activity toward ethanol oxidation, showing a high mass current density up to 3.05 A mgPd<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> , which is 4.5 times that of the commercial Pd/C catalyst (0.68 A mgPd<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> ).**

Heterostructures consisting of distinct components have attracted considerable attention due to their unique properties and promising applications in catalysis enabled by the synergistic effect among different components.[1–5] Since phase engineering of nanomaterials (PEN) provides various strategies to rationally design and synthesize nanomaterials with novel crystal phases,[6] the delicate modulation of crystal phases of each component in heterostructures with diverse morphologies becomes possible, which is of great importance to realize tunable physical and chemical properties and enhanced performances. In addition to controlling their compositions, morphologies, architectures, facets, sizes, and dimensionalities, tremendous efforts have been devoted to constructing heterostructures consisting of different phases during recent years. For example, highly luminescent CdSe/CdS heterostructure with tetrapod

morphology has been constructed by growing wurtzite-phase CdS nanorods on zinc blende phase CdSe seeds.[7] These tetrapod heterostructures also show excellent catalytic performance toward photocatalytic hydrogen evolution.[8] In 2016, our group reported the controlled epitaxial growth of wurtzite-phase CdS and CdSe nanorods on hexagonal-shaped nanoplates with different crystal structures, resulting in the formation of three different hierarchical heterostructures.[9] However, all the aforementioned studies only focus on the preparation of crystalline/ crystalline heterostructures.

Recently, crystalline/amorphous heterostructures have drawn increasing attention owing to their intriguing phase-dependent properties and promising catalytic applications.[10–12] Nevertheless, the synthesis of metal-based crystalline/amorphous heterostructures still remains a great challenge. Until now, only a few successful results have been reported. In addition, these materials are either heteromaterials, in which the crystalline and amorphous areas are made of different chemical compositions, such as CuS (crystalline)/Pd-Cu-S (amorphous)[12,13] and Co (crystalline)/Co3O4 (amorphous),[14] or homomaterials with the random distribution of the crystalline and amorphous areas, such as PtPb,[15] Pd,[11] and PdCu.[10] Furthermore, additional post-treatment processes, such as ion irradiation treatment of the presynthesized crystalline nanoplates,[15,16] were required to obtain some of the heterostructures. Therefore, it still remains a great challenge to construct well-defined core–shell crystalline@amorphous heterostructured nanomaterials with the same chemical components.

Herein, we report a facile wet-chemical method to prepare the binary (Pd-P) and ternary (Pd-Ni-P) crystalline@amorphous heterostructured nanoplates by cation exchange using the trigonal phase Cu3−*χ*P nanoplates, referred to as *t*-Cu3−*χ*P, as templates. The Cu ions of *t*-Cu3−*χ*P can be completely replaced by Pd to form the Pd-P nanoplate with a unique architecture, consisting of a crystalline core and an amorphous shell, referred to as *c*-Pd-P@*a*-Pd-P. Furthermore, the obtained *c*-Pd-P@*a*-Pd-P heterostructured nanoplates can be used as templates to be alloyed with Ni, forming Pd-Ni-P ternary heterostructured nanoplates, i.e., *c*-Pd-Ni-P@*a*-Pd-Ni-P. The atomic content of Ni in *c*-Pd-Ni-P@*a*-Pd-Ni-P nanoplates can be tuned from 9.47 to 38.61 at%. As a proof-of-concept application, all the obtained *c*-Pd-P@*a*-Pd-P and *c*-Pd-Ni-P@*a*-Pd-Ni-P heterostructured nanoplates are used as catalysts for electrocatalytic ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) in alkaline media, among which the *c*-Pd-Ni-P@*a*-Pd-Ni-P nanoplate with 9.47 at% Ni exhibits the highest mass activity (3.05 A mgPd<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> ), which is also higher than that of Pd/C and most previously reported electrocatalysts.

In a typical experiment, the *t*-Cu3−*χ*P nanoplates were synthesized by using a previously reported method with a slight modification (see the Experimental Section, Supporting Information, for details).[17] The characterizations using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), selected area electron diffraction (SAED), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) confirm the successful synthesis of *t*-Cu3−*χ*P nanoplates with predominantly exposed {001} planes (Figures S1 and S2, Supporting Information). Then, the *t*-Cu3−*χ*P nanoplates dispersed in trioctylphosphine (TOP) and 1-octadecene (ODE) were rapidly injected into a mixture of palladium precursor, ODE, oleylamine (OLM), and TOP at 250 °C to initiate the cation exchange reaction (see the Supporting Information for experimental details) to form the *c*-Pd-P@*a*-Pd-P nanoplates. The synthetic procedure for the synthesis of *c*-Pd-P@*a*-Pd-P heterostructured nanoplate is schematically shown in **Figure 1**a.

Figure S3 (Supporting Information) shows the low-magnification scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and TEM images of the *c*-Pd-P@*a*-Pd-P heterostructured nanoplates. Notably, two kinds of *c*-Pd-P@*a*-Pd-P nanoplates, with either Pd7P3 or Pd5P2 as the crystalline core, can be found, referred to as *c*-Pd7P3@*a*-Pd-P and *c*-Pd5P2@*a*-Pd-P, respectively. Based on their different crystal structures, statistical analysis result reveals that the percentage of *c*-Pd7P3@*a*-Pd-P nanoplates is about 90% in all the *c*-Pd-P@*a*-Pd-P nanoplates (Figure S4, Supporting Information). In particular, Figure 1b shows the TEM image of a typical *c*-Pd7P3@*a*-Pd-P nanoplate. The outer area of the *c*-Pd7P3@*a*-Pd-P nanoplate gives a brighter contrast than the inner area, forming an obvious interface. In addition, the outer area is twisted, implying that the outer area is flexible after the cation exchange. The corresponding SAED pattern (inset in Figure 1b), taken in the dashed circle in the nanoplate in Figure 1b, shows a set of strong spots, which can be indexed to the [001] zone axis of Pd7P3 with a rhombohedral crystal structure. Moreover, as shown in Figure S5 (Supporting Information), the SAED patterns, taken at the regions containing both the inner and outer areas of two different *c*-Pd7P3@*a*-Pd-P nanoplates, show discrete spots and a distinct amorphous ring (Figure S5a1,2, Supporting Information), demonstrating the coexistence of the crystalline and amorphous structures. Figure 1c–e shows the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images taken at different regions, i.e., the outer area, the interface area, and the inner area, of a nanoplate, respectively. The image taken at the interface area (Figure 1d) proves that the upper part is crystalline with lattice fringes of 0.23 nm, which can be indexed to the {140} planes of the Pd7P3 with a rhombohedral crystal structure, and the lower part is amorphous. The corresponding FFT pattern (inset in Figure 1d) presents the crystalline spots and an amorphous ring. In contrast, Figure 1c,e shows the complete amorphous and crystalline phases, respectively. In addition to the *c*-Pd7P3@*a*-Pd-P, small amount of *c*-Pd5P2@*a*-Pd-P nanoplates (≈10%) can also be observed. The TEM and HRTEM images of a typical *c*-Pd5P2@*a*-Pd-P heterostructured nanoplate (Figure S6a–c, Supporting Information) prove that the obtained nanoplate also has the crystalline@amorphous heterostructure (see the detailed discussion in the Supporting Information).

A focused ion beam (FIB) was further utilized to slice the nanoplate to reveal the cross-section structure (Figure S7a, Supporting Information). The corresponding TEM image taken at the tip area of a side-viewed nanoplate (Figure S7a1, Supporting Information) shows an amorphous structure. In addition, Figure S7a2,3 (Supporting Information), i.e., TEM images taken at both sides of the nanoplate (Figure S7a, Supporting Information), shows that a thin amorphous shell coats on the crystalline region, further demonstrating that the obtained nanoplate possesses the crystalline@amorphous core–shell structure. The STEM-EDS line scanning on the cross section of a nanoplate confirms the uniform distribution of the Pd and P in the core and shell (Figure S7c, Supporting Information). STEM elemental mappings (Figure 1f) and STEM-EDS result

(Figure S8, Supporting Information) further reveal the uniform distribution of the Pd and P elements in both the outer and inner areas. Furthermore, SEM-EDS result (Figure S9, Supporting Information) presents a Pd/P atomic ratio of 73:26 and a negligible concentration of Cu (≈1 at%), indicating the complete cation exchange. All the aforementioned results demonstrate the successful preparation of the *c*-Pd-P@*a*-Pd-P heterostructured nanoplates with a crystalline core and an amorphous shell.

XRD and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were used to investigate the as-obtained *c*-Pd-P@*a*-Pd-P nanoplates. As shown in the XRD pattern of *c*-Pd-P@*a*-Pd-P nanoplates (**Figure 2**a), the distinct sharp peaks can be indexed to the crystalline Pd7P3 and Pd5P2, and a broad band around 36°–45° indicates the presence of amorphous structure.[18,19] Importantly, the characteristic peaks of the *t*-Cu3−*χ*P disappear after the cation exchange, confirming there is no residual *t*-Cu3−*χ*P in the *c*-Pd-P@*a*-Pd-P nanoplates. XPS Pd 3d spectrum of the *c*-Pd-P@*a*-Pd-P heterostructured nanoplates (Figure 2b) indicates the coexistence of Pd (0) and Pd (II),[18,20] in which Pd (0) dominates. The peak of Pd (0) in *c*-Pd-P@*a*-Pd-P nanoplates, located at 335.5 eV, shows a positive shift as compared to that of the reported pure Pd (0) (335.2 eV),[20] indicating the change of the electronic structure of Pd in the *c*-Pd-P@*a*-Pd-P nanoplates. These results suggest that the amorphous shells in the *c*-Pd-P@*a*-Pd-P nanoplates are made of Pd-P alloy.[21,22] As for the P XPS spectrum (Figure S10a, Supporting Information), the peaks located at 130.7 and 129.9 eV can be assigned to the P 2p1/2 and P 2p3/2, respectively.[23,24] And the peak at 133.5 eV corresponds to the P2O5. [20] The binding energy of P 2p1/2 and P 2p3/2 in *c*-Pd-P@*a*-Pd-P nanoplates (130.7 and 129.9 eV) negatively shifts as compared with the reported red phosphorus (130.9 and 130.1 eV),[25] further confirming the formation of the Pd-P alloy.[21] In addition, there is no detectable Cu signal in the *c*-Pd-P@*a*-Pd-P heterostructured nanoplates (Figure S10b, Supporting Information), demonstrating the complete cation exchange, which is consistent with the SEM-EDS result (Figure S9, Supporting Information). Importantly, the obtained *c*-Pd-P@*a*-Pd-P nanoplates are quite stable at room temperature. The crystalline@amorphous core–shell structure of the *c*-Pd-P@*a*-Pd-P nanoplates can be maintained after being stored in toluene for 17 months (Figure S11, Supporting Information). XRD results show that, despite a slight oxidation, the crystalline phases of the *c*-Pd-P@*a*-Pd-P nanoplates, i.e., Pd7P3

and  $Pd_5P_2$ , do not change, even after 17 months (Figure S12, Supporting Information).

The as-obtained c-Pd-P@a-Pd-P nanoplates can be used as the templates for the further synthesis of ternary c-Pd-Ni-P@a-Pd-Ni-P heterostructured nanoplates (Figure 3a). Figure 3b and Figure S13 (Supporting Information) show the TEM images of the c-Pd-Ni-P@a-Pd-Ni-P nanoplates synthesized at the temperature of 200 °C. As shown in Figure 3b, the outer and inner areas of the nanoplate show distinctly different contrast (Figure 3b), forming an obvious interface. HRTEM images and the corresponding FFT patterns, taken at the outer (Figure 3c) and interface areas (Figure 3d) of the nanoplate, prove that the outer area of the nanoplate is amorphous while the inner area is crystalline. Furthermore, the SAED patterns of the c-Pd-Ni-P@a-Pd-Ni-P nanoplates (Figure S14, Supporting Information) show discrete spots and an amorphous ring. The XRD pattern (Figure S15, Supporting Information) shows an observable crystalline peak at ≈38° and a broad amorphous band around 36°-45°. These results further confirm that the obtained nanoplates possess the crystalline@amorphous structure. The chemical states of Pd (0), Ni (0), and P (0) in the c-Pd-Ni-P@a-Pd-Ni-P nanoplates were confirmed by XPS (Figure S16, Supporting Information). In addition, the elemental mappings in Figure 3e reveal the uniform distribution of Pd, Ni, and P elements, and the SEM-EDS measurement (Figure S17, Supporting Information) indicates the atomic content of Ni in c-Pd-Ni-P@a-Pd-Ni-P nanoplates synthesized at 200 °C is 16.43 at%. After the reaction temperature changed from 200 °C to 170 and 230 °C, although similar c-Pd-Ni-P@a-Pd-Ni-P nanoplates were obtained, as confirmed by TEM, XRD, and XPS (Figures S18–S20, Supporting Information), the atomic contents of Ni can be tuned from 16.43 at% (Figure S17, Supporting Information) to 9.47 and 38.61 at% (Figure S21, Supporting Information), respectively. It is worth mentioning that although great effort has been devoted to the preparation of Pd-P (P<sub>5</sub>P<sub>2</sub> and PdP<sub>2</sub>)[<sup>26,27</sup>] and Pd-Ni-P[<sup>18,20,22</sup>] nanomaterials, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first time to synthesize the Pd-P and Pd-Ni-P nanomaterials with core–shell crystalline@amorphous heterostructures, i.e., c-Pd-P@a-Pd-P and c-Pd-Ni-P@a-Pd-Ni-P.

As a proof-of-concept application, the heterostructured c-Pd-Ni-P@a-Pd-Ni-P and c-Pd-P@a-Pd-P nanoplates were used as electrocatalysts toward the EOR in alkaline media. The c-Pd-Ni-P@a-Pd-Ni-P nanoplates synthesized at 170, 200, and 230 °C, and the c-Pd-P@a-Pd-P nanoplates are referred to as Samples 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. The electrochemically active surface areas (ECSAs) were first evaluated by cyclic voltammogram (CV) measurements at scan rate of 50 mV s<sup>-1</sup> in N<sub>2</sub>-saturated 1.0 m KOH aqueous solution (Figure 4a and Figure S22a, Supporting Information). As shown in Figure S22b (Supporting Information), Sample 1 shows the highest ECSA of  $27.5 \text{ m}^2 \text{ g}_{\text{Pd}}^{-1}$ , compared to Samples 2, 3, and 4. The mass activities and specific activities in electrocatalytic EOR were recorded by CV measurements at scan rate of 50 mV s<sup>-1</sup> in aqueous solution containing 1.0 M KOH and 1.0 M C2H5OH (Figure 4b and Figure S22c, Supporting Information). As compared to the Samples 2, 3, 4 and commercial Pd/C, the Sample 1 presents the highest catalytic current density for EOR in the potential range of 0.6-0.9 V (vs RHE). Specifically, the mass activity of Sample 1 for EOR is calculated to be 3.05 A mg<sub>Pd</sub><sup>-1</sup> based on the peak current density shown in Figure 4b, which is 4.5 times that of commercial Pd/C (0.68 A mg<sub>Pd</sub><sup>-1</sup>, Figure 4c). The electrocatalytic stability of Sample 1 was also investigated, as shown in Figure 4d. After 1800 s chronoamperometry measurements, the mass activity of Sample 1 (0.38 A  $mg_{Pd}^{-1}$ ) is almost 1.8, 2, 2.5, and 5.6 times higher than that of Samples 2 (0.21 A  $mg_{Pd}^{-}$ 3 (0.19 A  $mg_{Pd}^{-1}$ ), 4 (0.15 A  $mg_{Pd}^{-1}$ ) and commercial Pd/C (0.068 A mg<sub>Pd</sub><sup>-1</sup>), respectively, indicating the higher electrocatalytic stability of Sample 1 compared to the others. Impressively, TEM images of Sample 1 (Figure S23, Supporting Information) show no obvious morphology change after the stability test, indicating its excellent structural stability. Based on the aforementioned results, Sample 1 exhibits excellent EOR performance with both much higher mass current density and higher stability, far superior to Samples 2, 3, 4 and Pd/C. Notably, the obtained mass activity of Sample 1 is better than those of most reported electrocatalysts, as shown in Table S1 (Supporting Information).[20,28-38]

The superior electrocatalytic performance of Sample 1 could be explained as follows. First, the coexistence of crystalline and amorphous structures in c-Pd-Ni-P@a-Pd-Ni-P nanoplates benefits the formation of low-coordination atoms, giving rise to the change of electron band structure of the Pd atoms and the enhancement in electrocatalytic activity. [15,16,30] Second, it

has been demonstrated that the incorporation of oxophilic metal, such as Ni, into the Pd-based catalysts could benefit the generation of \*OH and thus enhance the catalytic activity in EOR.[20] During the EOR process, the Pd atoms generally promote the dehydrogenation of ethanol to form \*CH3CO, which can combine with the \*OH formed on Ni atoms to generate CH3COOH that further becomes CH3COO<sup>−</sup> after the reaction with OH− in the alkaline electrolyte. Therefore, the production of poisoning specie like CO is effectively suppressed, resulting in enhanced catalytic activity and stability.[20,39] Similarly, in our work, due to the incorporation of Ni in the binary *c*-Pd-P@*a*-Pd-P heterostructured nanoplates, the formed ternary *c*-Pd-Ni-P@*a*-Pd-Ni-P heterostructured nanoplates showed better electrocatalytic activity and stability toward EOR in the alkaline electrolyte compared to the binary *c*-Pd-P@*a*-Pd-P heterostructured nanoplates.

In summary, we report a wet-chemical method for the synthesis of *c*-Pd-P@*a*-Pd-P binary heterostructured nanoplates with a new crystalline@amorphous core–shell structure. By using the as-prepared *c*-Pd-P@*a*-Pd-P nanoplates as the templates, ternary *c*-Pd-Ni-P@*a*-Pd-Ni-P nanoplates have been prepared. Impressively, when used as catalyst, the obtained *c*-Pd-Ni-P@*a*-Pd-Ni-P heterostructured nanoplates with 9.47 at% Ni exhibit a superior electrocatalytic activity for EOR in alkaline media, which is better than the commercial Pd/C and most reported electrocatalysts. We believe that the strategy presented here may offer new opportunities for the synthesis of novel nanomaterials with desired structures, crystal phases, and morphologies to tailor their unique properties and enhance their promising applications.

Formate is a kind of carbon-neutral fuel that can be synthesized from electrochemical conversion of CO<sub>2</sub>, however, the generated aqueous formate electrolyte is still short of potential application. Here, formate solution is proposed to be utilized as anode fuels of direct formate fuel cells through the formate oxidation reaction (FOR), and graphene supported AgPd nanoalloys (AgPd/rGO) are prepared to catalyze FOR. Specifically, the mass activity of as-prepared Ag<sub>49</sub>Pd<sub>51</sub>/rGO catalyst is 4.21 A mg<sup>-1</sup><sub>Pd</sub> and the retention activity of Ag<sub>49</sub>Pd<sub>51</sub>/rGO is 49.1% of initial activity after successive 500 cycles, which is 2.48 and 3.03 times higher than that of unsupported Ag<sub>51</sub>Pd<sub>49</sub> nanoalloys. When increasing the positive scan limit from 0.0 to 0.8 V, the mass activity of Ag<sub>49</sub>Pd<sub>51</sub>/rGO catalyst increases from 2.32 to 6.03 A mg<sup>-1</sup><sub>Pd</sub> and Pd surface coverage increases from 51.87% to 62.42%, indicating the occurrence of surface reconstruction where Pd atoms migrate to the surface of AgPd nanoalloys, and less intensive reconstruction is observed in unsupported Ag<sub>51</sub>Pd<sub>49</sub> nanoalloys, whose mass activity increases from 1.35 to 2.49 A mg<sup>-1</sup><sub>Pd</sub>. The diving force and kinetic path are calculated for the surface reconstruction induced by the adsorption of H, O and C atoms, in case of C atoms on graphene, the segregation energy of surface Pd atom in AgPd nanoalloy is -1.16 eV, the activation energy for the migration of subsurface Pd atom to surface is 0.54 eV, which are lower than the segregation (0.03 eV) and activation (2.06 eV) energy on clean alloy surface.

Converting CO<sub>2</sub> into chemicals to store solar and wind energy is a promising strategy to mitigate global warming, 1-3 and the conversion reaction through controlling conditions and catalysts can produce a wide variety of fuels.<sup>4-6</sup> in which CO. formic acid and formate have been shown to be yielded with sufficient Faraday efficiency.<sup>7,8</sup> CO can be used as a raw material for syngas, 9, 10 and formic acid is economically viable to be produced due to its relatively high market price. 11 In contrast, formate has not a sufficient and effective application although many efforts have been focused on the production of it.8, 12 At present, formate is mainly applied as deicing agent and its market potential is small.<sup>13</sup> Separating solid formate from the generated aqueous electrolyte is not economically feasible since the process requires enormous energy, and the generated aqueous formate electrolyte is in the lack of potential application. 10 Fortunately, the emergence of direct formate fuel cells is expected to solve this problem, which can directly convert the chemical energy of formate into electrical energy in aqueous solution, 14, 15 with advantages of safety, easy operation, high power density and low cost. 16, 17

The utilization of aqueous formate solution is primarily carried out through the formate oxidation reaction (FOR) at the anode of direct formate fuel cells. 18 Because of the intrinsically sluggish kinetics of FOR,19-21 it requires the application of catalysts with high-performance and low-cost to facilitate the reaction, which attracted intensive efforts. For example, Wang et al.<sup>22</sup> prepared Pd/C to catalyze the formate oxidation reaction with a mass activity of 577.78 mA mg<sup>-1</sup><sub>Pd</sub>. Noborikawa et al.23 reported PdCu/C can reach a peak current density of 3.461 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, which is 1.8 times that of commercial Pd/C. Roy et al.24 indicated that Pd4Ag/C can catalyze the oxidation of formate as an intermediate during methanol oxidation reaction with a mass activity of 38.4 mA mg<sup>-1</sup><sub>Pd</sub>. Han et al.<sup>25</sup> reported PtAg nanoalloy shows a mass activity of 830 mA mg<sup>-1</sup><sub>Pt</sub> in comparison with that of Pd black (606 mA mg<sup>-1</sup><sub>Pd</sub>). Sankar et al.<sup>26</sup> demonstrated PdCo/C can generate a FOR activity of 2.7 A mg-<sup>1</sup> in comparison with the 1.5 A mg<sup>-1</sup> for commercial Pd/C. However, previous experimental results have shown that the surface of nanoalloy catalysts would undergo significant modifications in its composition and chemical state in response to the reaction conditions, 27, 28 that is, surface reconstruction where the as-prepared catalyst surface can lose its predesigned structure during reaction, thus making the catalyst design meaningless. How to understand and predict surface reconstruction of bimetallic catalysts during the reaction has become a fundamental problem.<sup>29</sup>

The surface reconstruction taking place during reaction are usually driven by the interactions with the surrounding reactants/products on working condition or by exposure to the

external stimuli such as electric potential. 30-32 For example, Tao et al.33 reported that the surface of RhPd nanoalloy is rich in Rh under the oxidation condition while Pd segregate to the surface under reduction condition due to the lower surface energy. McCrum et al.<sup>34</sup> demonstrated that Pt nanoparticles is enclosed mainly by (111) plane in vacuum, while the (100) and (110) planes grow when subjected to a potential in electrolyte. Moreover, Kitchin et al.<sup>35</sup> illustrated that, in Ag<sub>3</sub>Pd nanoalloy, Ag segregate to surface in vacuum, and Pd segregation becomes preferred with increasing the oxygen content. The surface reconstruction have previously been reported in FOR catalysts. Mao et al.<sup>36</sup> demonstrated the activity of AuPdCu nanoalloy can be 3.29 times higher than that of commercial Pd/C after removing surface Cu and increasing surface oxides of Pd and Au. Wang et al.<sup>21</sup> reported that an electrochemical de-alloying can remove the surface Cu and increase Pd active sites on the surface of AgPdCu aerogel, leading to a mass activity of 3.9 times higher than that of commercial Pd/C. Wang et al.37 illustrated the catalytic performance of AgPdPt aerogels increases with increasing the upper limit potential in cyclic voltammetry (CV) test, and a peak mass current density of 2.94 A mg<sup>-1</sup><sub>Pd+Pt</sub> is obtained at the upper limit potential of 1.3 V. Despite these higher FOR activities of reconstructed surface, the understanding of how these surface nanostructures evolve during the catalytic process is still unclear, which hinders the rational design and utilization of FOR catalysts.

In this work, graphene supported AgPd nanoalloys (AgPd/rGO) are prepared by a one-pot microwave assisted synthesis method. Specifically, the mass activity of Ag<sub>49</sub>Pd<sub>51</sub>/rGO catalyst is 6.38 times higher than commercial Pd/C catalyst, and the Ag<sub>49</sub>Pd<sub>51</sub>/rGO shows a promising durability after successive 500 cycles, whose retention activity is 13.98 times higher than Pd/C catalyst. Moreover, when increasing the positive scan limit during FOR test, the mass activity of Ag<sub>49</sub>Pd<sub>51</sub>/rGO catalyst increases from 2.32 to 6.03 A mg-1<sub>Pd</sub> and Pd surface coverage increases from 51.87% to 62.42%, indicating a surface reconstruction, and less intensive reconstruction is observed in unsupported Ag<sub>51</sub>Pd<sub>49</sub> nanoalloys, whose mass activity increases from 1.35 to 2.49 A mg<sup>-1</sup><sub>Pd</sub>. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation indicates that upon adsorption of H, O, and C atoms on the surface of AgPd nanoalloys, the segregation energy of one subsurface Pd atom to surface is -0.26, -0.36 and -1.16 eV, the activation energy for the migration of Pd atom to surface is 1.62, 1.39 and 0.54 eV, respectively, which are lower than the segregation (0.03 eV) and activation (2.06 eV) energy on clean alloy surface and thus provide a diving force and kinetics path for the observed surface reconstruction. Furthermore, the more obvious surface reconstruction of Ag<sub>49</sub>Pd<sub>51</sub>/rGO catalyst than Ag<sub>51</sub>Pd<sub>49</sub> nanoalloy can be attributed to the stronger inducing effect of C than H and O atoms.

#### Fabrication of AgPd nanoalloys:

AgPd nanoalloys were synthesized by microwave-assisted synthesis method. In a typical synthesis of  $Ag_{50}Pd_{50}$ , 5 mL of trisodium citrate (0.48 M), 21 mL precursor solution of silver nitrate (0.02 M) and palladium nitrate (0.02 M) were dropped into the mixed solution of 8.2 mL deionized water and 30 mL ethylene glycol under stirring. After sonicated for 10 minutes, it was microwave heated at 800 W (heated for 30 s, then stirred for 5 s, and repeated for 3 times). The  $Ag_{50}Pd_{50}$  catalyst was collected by centrifugation, washed for 3 times with deionized water, and freeze dried for 12 h. For comparison, Pd was prepared by the same method except that no silver nitrate was added in metal precursor solution.

#### Fabrication of AgPd/rGO catalysts:

AgPd/rGO catalysts were synthesized by a microwave-assisted synthesis method, which was optimized via adjusting the parameters (Fig. S1, S2 and S3, Supporting information). In a typical synthesis of Ag<sub>50</sub>Pd<sub>50</sub>/rGO catalyst, 21 mg GO was dispersed in a mixed solution of 20 mL deionized water and 30 mL ethylene glycol. After sonicated for 30 minutes, the mixed solution was successively dropped with 5 mL of 0.48 M trisodium citrate, 4.2 mL precursor solution of silver nitrate (0.02 M) and palladium nitrate (0.02 M) under stirring. After stirred for 30 minutes, it was microwave heated at 800 W (heated for 30 s, then stirred for 5 s, and repeated for 3 times). The Ag<sub>50</sub>Pd<sub>50</sub>/rGO catalyst was collected by centrifugation, washed for 3 times with deionized water, and freeze dried for 12 h. Ag/rGO, Pd/rGO and AgPd/rGO with other ratios were prepared by changing the mole fraction of silver nitrate and palladium nitrate in the precursor solution. For comparison, reduced graphene oxide (rGO) were prepared by the same method except that no metal precursor solution was added.

#### Physical characterization:

Power X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurement was performed with a PANalytical X'Pert Pro MPD X-ray diffractometer using Cu  $K\alpha_1$  as the radiation source ( $\lambda$  = 0.15406 nm). The micromorphology and structure of the catalysts were examined with scanning electron microscopy (SEM, FEI Nova 450 field-emission scanning electron microscope) equipped with a X-ray energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM, FEI Themis Z with two aberration correctors and FEI Talos FRG 200F) and high-angle annular dark-field scanning TEM (HADDF STEM). The surface composition and electronic structures of the catalysts were analyzed with the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ESCALAB 250) using

monochromatic Al K $\alpha$  source (hv = 1486.6 eV) in ultrahigh vacuum (10<sup>-9</sup> Torr). The relative content of elements on the surface were calculated by integrating their corresponding peak in XPS spectra, and the position of d-band centers ( $\epsilon_d$ ) were calculated according to the following formula with the range from 0 to 9 eV:

$$\epsilon^{d} = \frac{\int N(\epsilon)\epsilon d\epsilon}{\int N(\epsilon)d\epsilon} \tag{1}$$

Where N( $\epsilon$ ) is the density of states (DOS) in XPS valance band spectra, which are corrected with the Shirley background. The mass fraction of Ag and Pd in the prepared catalysts was measured with SEM-EDS and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES) as displayed in Fig. S4 and Table S1 (Supporting information). The prepared AgPd/rGO catalysts with different Ag/Pd ratio and Ag<sub>50</sub>Pd<sub>50</sub> nanoalloy were corrected as Ag<sub>77</sub>Pd<sub>23</sub>/rGO, Ag<sub>49</sub>Pd<sub>51</sub>/rGO, Ag<sub>27</sub>Pd<sub>73</sub>/rGO and Ag<sub>51</sub>Pd<sub>49</sub>, respectively.

#### **Electrochemical measurements:**

Electrochemical measurements were conducted at room temperature using electrochemical workstation (CHI 660C, Shanghai Chenhua Apparatus, China) and a three electrode electrochemical cell. A glassy carbon electrode (5 mm in diameter) coated with catalysts was used as working electrode, while a Pt wire electrode and an Hg/HgO (1 M KOH) electrode were used as counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively. In this work, unless indicated, all potential were versus Hg/HgO electrode.

To prepare the catalyst ink, 2 mg catalysts were dispersed in a mixture of 990  $\mu L$  of ethanol and 10  $\mu L$  of nafion solution (5 wt. %) under ultrasonication for 30 min. And the glassy carbon electrode was dropped with 10  $\mu L$  of prepared catalyst ink and dried under ambient conditions to obtain the working electrode after successively polished with 1.0, 0.3 and 0.05  $\mu m$  of alumina powder, cleaned with deionized water, and dried with  $N_2$ . The electrolyte consisted of 1.0 M KOH or 1.0 M KOH + 1.0 M HCOOK solution was deaerated by purged with high purity  $N_2$  for 30 min before measurements, and this atmosphere was maintained by a flow of  $N_2$  over it during the entire measurement. For all the CV test, the scan rate was set to 50 mV s $^{-1}$  and the lower limit potential was set to -1.0 V, and for CA tests, the initial potential was set to -0.2 V.

ECSAs of as-prepared catalysts were calculated by quantification of the electric charges associated with the reduction of PdO as shown in the following equation:<sup>38</sup>

$$ECSA = \frac{Q}{m \times C \times v}$$
 (2)

Where Q is the charge for the reduction of PdO on the surface, which can be obtained from integrating the area of PdO reduction. m is the mass of Pd, and C is the charge required to reduce the monolayer of PdO (405  $\mu$ C cm<sup>-2</sup>). v is the scan rate (50 mV s<sup>-1</sup> in this work).

#### **DFT methods:**

According to the XRD patterns in Fig. 1, the (111) surface of the AgPd nanoparticles are chosen in our model and constructed by cutting the fcc structure of Pd along the [111] direction. The (111) surface of AgPd nanoparticles were modeled using a (2  $\times$  2) supercell with a four-layer slab containing 4 atoms per layer

and a 15 Å vacuum zone in the z direction. Ag and Redatoms in the top two layers and the entire adsorbates were fully relaxed, while the bottom two layers were fixed at the bulk positions.

DFT calculations were carried out with DMol<sup>3</sup> package of Materials Studio. Generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) function was used to study all of the properties in DFT level. The orbital cutoff range was set to 5.0 Å, and the fermi smearing was 0.005 Ha. Moreover, the DFT Semi-core Pseudo-potential core treatment and the double numerical plus polarization (DNP) basis set were chosen in this work. To obtain well-converged geometric structures, the value of Self-Consistent-Field (SCF) convergence was set within 10<sup>-6</sup>. Moreover, the values of energy, maximum force and the maximum displacement were set to 10<sup>-5</sup> Ha, 0.002 Ha/Å and 0.005 Å, respectively. A  $5 \times 5 \times 1$  grid was set to be accurate as well as computationally efficient to optimize the geometry of the model. The minimum energy pathways of HCOO oxidation and surface reconstruction were determined with the complete LST/QST method with a RMS convergence of 0.002 Ha/Å, which have been confirmed as a precisely and quickly tool to search for the transition state (TS).<sup>39</sup> The adsorption energy ( $E_{ads}$ ) was calculated with the following equation:40

$$E_{ads} = E_{adsorbate} + surface - E_{adsorbate} - E_{surface}$$
 (3

Where  $E_{\rm adsorbate + surface}$  is the total energy of the adsorbates interacting with AgPd slab,  $E_{\rm adsorbate}$  is the energy of the adsorbates in gas phase, and  $E_{\rm surface}$  is the energy of clean AgPd slab surface. The segregation energy of Pd atoms to surface ( $E_{\rm Pd}^{\rm seg}$ ) was calculated by the following formula:

$$E_{Pd}^{seg} = E_{Pd \text{ on surface}} - E_{Pd \text{ in bulk}}$$
 (4)

where  $E_{Pd \text{ on surface}}$  and  $E_{Pd \text{ in bulk}}$  are the total energy of the slab models with Pd on the surface and in the bulk, respectively.

#### Results and discussion

#### Microstructure of as-prepared catalysts

Fig. 1a shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of as-prepared Ag/rGO, Ag<sub>77</sub>Pd<sub>23</sub>/rGO, Ag<sub>49</sub>Pd<sub>51</sub>/rGO, Ag<sub>27</sub>Pd<sub>73</sub>/rGO, Pd/rGO and rGO catalysts. The four peaks indexed to (111), (200), (220) and (311) planes feature the face-centered cubic (fcc) crystalline structure of AgPd nanoparticles, and the peaks at approximately 24° to 26° indexed to (002) planes of rGO. The (111) peaks of Ag<sub>77</sub>Pd<sub>23</sub>/rGO, Ag<sub>49</sub>Pd<sub>51</sub>/rGO and Ag<sub>27</sub>Pd<sub>73</sub>/rGO catalysts are located between the (111) peak of Ag/rGO and Pd/rGO catalysts, and shift to a higher 2θ value with the increase of Pd content, demonstrating the formation of AgPd alloy. Estimated with Scherrer's formula,41 the crystallite sizes of Ag/rGO, Ag<sub>77</sub>Pd<sub>23</sub>/rGO, Ag<sub>49</sub>Pd<sub>51</sub>/rGO, Ag<sub>27</sub>Pd<sub>73</sub>/rGO and Pd/rGO catalysts are 9.6, 3.2, 3.5 and 3.4 nm, respectively. Fig. 1b shows the XRD patterns of Ag<sub>49</sub>Pd<sub>51</sub>/rGO, bimetallic Ag<sub>51</sub>Pd<sub>49</sub> and monometallic Pd catalysts. Ag<sub>49</sub>Pd<sub>51</sub>/rGO and Ag<sub>51</sub>Pd<sub>49</sub> catalysts have the similar four peaks indexed to the (111), (200), (220) and (311) planes, which have a low angular shift in comparison with Pd, demonstrating the alloying of Ag with Pd in Ag<sub>51</sub>Pd<sub>49</sub>. Moreover, the crystallite sizes of Ag<sub>51</sub>Pd<sub>49</sub> and Pd are estimated as 3.6 and 6.2 nm, respectively, which are larger than that of Ag<sub>49</sub>Pd<sub>51</sub>/rGO and Pd/rGO catalysts,

proving the effect of graphene as support to make the AgPd nanoparticles finer.

The morphology of the as-prepared catalysts are tested by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Fig. 2a, S5 and S6a (Supporting information) show the SEM images of AgPd/rGO catalysts, which exhibit a typical 3D graphene framework morphology,<sup>42</sup> where the active species can be provided with greater accessibility to the catalyst, facilitating efficient mass transfer of the reactants and products.<sup>43</sup> Fig. 2b shows the TEM image and particle size distribution of Ag<sub>49</sub>Pd<sub>51</sub>/rGO catalyst, it reveals that the AgPd nanoparticles are uniformly distributed on graphene with an

average size of approximately 2.8 nm. High resolution TEM (HRTEM) image in Fig. 2c indicates that the d-spacing of  $Ag_{49}Pd_{51}/rGO$  catalyst corresponding to the (111) planes are 0.2336 nm, which is between the value of Ag (0.2359 nm) and Pd (0.2246 nm),<sup>44, 45</sup> indicating the Ag/Pd alloying, which is further confirmed by the corresponding energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mappings and line scanning profile in Fig. 2d, since the distribution of Ag and Pd is very similar. According to Fig. S6c and S6d (Supporting information), the morphology of  $Ag_{51}Pd_{49}$  nanoalloy is porous, which have a relative large specific surface area. Compared with rGO

in Fig. S6e and S6f (Supporting information), the morphology of  $Ag_{49}Pd_{51}/rGO$  catalyst in Fig. S6a, S6b and S7 (Supporting information) appears to be rougher, demonstrating the effective loading of AgPd nanoparticles.

# Effect of potential on electrocatalytic performance during formate oxidation

Fig. 3a shows the CV curves of  $Ag_{49}Pd_{51}/rGO$ ,  $Ag_{51}Pd_{49}$  and commercial Pd/C catalysts in  $N_2$ -saturated 1 M KOH + 1 M HCOOK electrolyte. The peak mass current density of  $Ag_{49}Pd_{51}/rGO$  catalyst is 4.21 A  $mg^{-1}_{Pd}$  in forward scan and 5.17 A  $mg^{-1}_{Pd}$  in backward scan. Rather than poisoning of catalysts, the higher peak in backward scan is believed due to the reduction of Pd oxide produces a large amount of fresh Pd to catalyze the oxidation of formate. In forward scan, the peak mass activity of  $Ag_{49}Pd_{51}/rGO$  catalyst is 2.48 and 6.38 times higher than that of  $Ag_{51}Pd_{49}$  nanoalloy (1.70 A  $mg^{-1}_{Pd}$ ) and commercial Pd/C catalyst (0.66 A  $mg^{-1}_{Pd}$ ), indicating that the introducing of graphene can improve the catalytic activity of

AgPd nanoalloy. Fig. 3b shows the peak mass activity of Pd/rGO and AgPd/rGO catalysts with different Ag/Pd ratios, the peak mass current density decreases in the sequence:  $Ag_{49}Pd_{51}/rGO$  $(4.21 \text{ A mg}^{-1}_{Pd}) > Ag_{27}Pd_{73}/rGO (3.14 \text{ A mg}^{-1}_{Pd}) > Ag_{77}Pd_{23}/rGO$  $(2.72 \text{ A mg}^{-1}_{Pd}) > Pd/rGO (2.04 \text{ A mg}^{-1}_{Pd})$ , which exhibits the same trend on Ag<sub>51</sub>Pd<sub>49</sub> nanoalloy and Pd (Fig. S8, Supporting information) and proves the Ag/Pd alloying effect on improving the FOR catalytic activity of Pd/rGO catalyst. The alloying effect is further confirmed by the potential energy profiles in Fig. S9 (Supporting information) where Ag<sub>50</sub>Pd<sub>50</sub> slab shows the lowest activation energy of 0.62 eV and the highest energy release of 0.43 eV for formate oxidation reaction. Fig. S10 (Supporting information) provides the electrochemical active surface areas (ECSAs) of Ag<sub>49</sub>Pd<sub>51</sub>/rGO, Ag<sub>51</sub>Pd<sub>49</sub> and commercial Pd/C catalysts. The ECSA of Ag<sub>49</sub>Pd<sub>51</sub>/rGO catalyst is as high as 103.27 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup><sub>Pd</sub>, which is 3.36 and 4.64 times higher than that of Ag<sub>51</sub>Pd<sub>49</sub> nanoalloy and Pd/C catalyst, respectively, suggesting the introducing of graphene can greatly increase the number of catalytic active sites on AgPd nanoalloy. Moreover, Fig. S11

(Supporting information) shows the ECSAs of  $Ag_{77}Pd_{23}/rGO$ ,  $Ag_{49}Pd_{51}/rGO$ ,  $Ag_{27}Pd_{73}/rGO$  and Pd/rGO catalysts are 103.22, 103.27, 80.73 and 59.15 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup><sub>Pd</sub>, which exhibits the same trend of peak mass activity as shown in Fig. 3b. For comparison, the CV curves of Ag/rGO and rGO in electrolyte of 1 M KOH and 1 M KOH + 1 M HCOOK are shown in Fig. S12. The FOR catalytic activity of Ag/rGO or rGO is very low, it is obvious the Ag and graphene improve catalytic activity of  $Ag_{49}Pd_{51}/rGO$  is through the alloying effect and supporting effect, rather than coming from the catalytic activity of Ag and graphene themselves.

Chronoamperometric (CA) tests were performed to evaluate the durability of  $Ag_{49}Pd_{51}/rGO$ ,  $Ag_{51}Pd_{49}$  and commercial Pd/C catalysts as shown in Fig. 3c. The retention activity of  $Ag_{49}Pd_{51}/rGO$  and  $Ag_{51}Pd_{49}$  catalysts are 0.118 and 0.012 A mg<sup>-1</sup>Pd after 3600s, respectively, whereas commercial Pd/C loses the activity at approximately 2400s. To have a clearer comparison, the cycling stability curves of  $Ag_{49}Pd_{51}/rGO$ ,  $Ag_{51}Pd_{49}$  and Pd/C catalysts are shown in Fig. 3d and S13 (Supporting information). During cycling stability test, the catalytic activity and ECSA of the catalysts decline during the process of long-term operation, which can be explained as follows. Firstly, the intermediates such as H and  $CO_3^{2-}$  might be adsorbed on the surface of catalysts and occupy the active sites.

thereby inhibiting the continuing of FOR. Secondly, some harmful impurities in electrolyte such as  $SO_4^{2-}$  and  $Cl^-$  could interact with nanoparticles and make the surface active sites decreased. Moreover, the concentration of formate near the working electrode will decrease with the catalytic reaction going on, especially when the current is high. In addition, the long-term potential cycling will lead to partial oxidation of catalyst, reconstruction of crystal surface, corrosion of graphene support and agglomeration of nanoparticles, thus affecting catalytic activity. Despite that, after 500 CV cycles, the mass activity of Ag<sub>49</sub>Pd<sub>51</sub>/rGO catalyst remains at 49.1%, while Ag<sub>51</sub>Pd<sub>49</sub> nanoallov and commercial Pd/C catalyst retain 37.5% and 18.9%, respectively. The superior activity and stability of Ag<sub>49</sub>Pd<sub>51</sub>/rGO catalyst can be attributed to the effect of alloying Ag with Pd and the extremely large surface area of graphene as support, making Ag<sub>49</sub>Pd<sub>51</sub>/rGO a powerful candidate to realize the effective utilization of formate.

Many experimental evidences have demonstrated that the surface of as-prepared catalysts is metastable under working condition, thereby significantly influence the catalytic performance.<sup>30, 46, 47</sup> Therefore, the as-prepared catalysts were conditioned by potential cycling to investigate the possible surface reconstruction.

Ag<sub>49</sub>Pd<sub>51</sub>/rGO catalyst recorded under different upper limit potential of 0.0, 0.4, 0.8 and 1.2 V. The current density first increases when increasing the upper limit potential from 0.0 to 0.8 V and then decreases at 1.2 V, indicating that the surface of Ag<sub>49</sub>Pd<sub>51</sub>/rGO catalyst have been rearranged. The similar phenomenon for AgPd nanoalloy is observed as shown in Fig. 4b, as a contrast, the catalytic activity of monometallic Pd is not increased on increasing the positive scan limit from 0.0 V to 0.8 V (Fig. S14, Supporting information). To further study the effect of scanning potential range on FOR catalytic performance, the FOR peak mass activity of Ag<sub>49</sub>Pd<sub>51</sub>/rGO, Ag<sub>51</sub>Pd<sub>49</sub> nanoalloy and monometallic Pd catalysts obtained at different upper limit potential are compared as shown in Fig. 4c and 4d. On increasing the positive scan limit, the current density of  $Ag_{49}Pd_{51}/rGO$  catalyst increases from 2.32 (2.13) A  $mg^{-1}_{Pd}$  at 0.0 V to 6.03 (4.98) A  $mg^{-1}_{Pd}$  at 0.8 (0.4) V and then decreases to 1.71 (0.42) A mg<sup>-1</sup><sub>Pd</sub> at 1.2 V in forward (backward) scan. Meanwhile, the current density of Ag<sub>51</sub>Pd<sub>49</sub> nanoalloy increases from 1.35 (1.19) A  $mg^{-1}_{Pd}$  at 0.0 V to 2.49 (2.51) A  $mg^{-1}_{Pd}$  at 1.0 (0.8) V and decreases to 2.28 (1.45) A mg<sup>-1</sup><sub>Pd</sub> at 1.2 V in forward (backward) scan. For monometallic Pd catalyst, the currentdensity is almost constant in forward scan and is always

falling over in backward scan when increasing the upper scan limit from 0.0 V to 1.2 V. Clearly, the upper limit potential in CV scan has an obvious impact on the surface structure of Ag<sub>49</sub>Pd<sub>51</sub>/rGO and Ag<sub>51</sub>Pd<sub>49</sub> catalysts, their enhancement are more obvious than monometallic Pd catalyst, indicating the alloying of Ag with Pd can make the catalyst more sensitive to the scanning potential range. Moreover,  $Ag_{49}Pd_{51}/rGO$  catalyst has more intensive enhancement in catalytic activity in comparison with Ag<sub>51</sub>Pd<sub>49</sub> nanoalloy, which proves that the introducing of graphene can amplify the influence of upper limit potential on catalytic activity. By adjusting the upper limit potential, a considerable mass activity of 6.03 A mg<sup>-1</sup><sub>Pd</sub> can be obtained in Ag<sub>49</sub>Pd<sub>51</sub>/rGO catalyst, which is 9.18 times higher than that of commercial Pd/C catalyst. It is worth noting that the activity decline of Ag<sub>49</sub>Pd<sub>51</sub>/rGO catalyst is more intensive than Ag<sub>51</sub>Pd<sub>49</sub> nanoalloy and monometallic Pd after 0.8 V, which might because the excessive high potential could accelerate the corrosion of graphene support.<sup>48</sup>

Wang et al. reported the similar phenomenon for AgPdPt aerogel, the FOR activity increases on increasing the positive scan limit from 1.1 to 1.3 V, which is attributed to the surface reconstruction by the outward diffusion of Ag.<sup>37</sup> However, the effect of support on FOR has not been investigated, whereas the

more obvious activity enhancement is observed for  $Ag_{49}Pd_{51}/rGO$  catalyst than unsupported  $Ag_{51}Pd_{49}$  nanoalloy in this study. The support of catalysts are demonstrated have a critical effect on the surface reconstruction during reaction. For example, Divins et al. reported that the ceria support prevents the Rh atoms on RhPd nanoparticles from undergoing surface reconstruction, which has a strong influence on the ethanol steam reforming activity. In contrast, Pd surface segregation is reported over the  $Rh_{0.5}Pd_{0.5}/CeO_2$ -nanorods rather than  $Rh_{0.5}Pd_{0.5}/CeO_2$ -nanocubes.

# Surface composition and structure evolution during formate oxidation reaction

To further investigate the reason why the FOR activity of  $Ag_{49}Pd_{51}/rGO$  catalyst changes significantly with the increase of upper limit potential, the surface of  $Ag_{49}Pd_{51}/rGO$  catalyst after FOR test in 1 M KOH + 1 M HCOOK electrolyte was measured by XPS as shown in Fig 5 and S15 (Supporting information). Fig. 5a and 5b depict the Pd 3d and Ag 3d spectra of  $Ag_{49}Pd_{51}/rGO$  catalyst after FOR test at different upper limit potential of 0.0, 0.4, 0.8 and 1.2 V. The Pd 3d spectra including  $3d_{3/2}$  and  $3d_{5/2}$  peaks can be deconvoluted into the metallic state of Pd(0) and

bivalent states of Pd(II), respectively. 50, 51 On increasing the upper limit potential, the fraction of Pd(II) increases from 39.86% at 0.0 V to 41.06% at 0.8 V, and then decreases to 40.36% at 1.2V (Table S2, Supporting information). The Pd(II) component is considered origin from the interaction of Pd-O and Pd-C, when the upper limit potential increases from 0.0 to 0.8 V, the oxidation of Pd increases, resulting in the increased fraction of Pd(II), however, when the upper limit potential is too high, graphene support is corroded rapidly, with the weaken interaction of Pd-C, leading to the decreased fraction of Pd(II) at 1.2 V. Meanwhile, the fraction of Ag(I) component increases from 26.96% at 0.0 V to 31.92% at 0.8 V, and then decreases to 7.31% at 1.2 V.52,53 Moreover, the percentage increase of Ag(I) is more obvious than Pd(II) on increasing the positive scan limit. Fig. 5c shows the contents of surface Pd and Ag with different valence for the Ag<sub>49</sub>Pd<sub>51</sub>/rGO catalyst at various upper limit potential. After FOR test, the surface Pd content is improved in comparison with the bulk content. On increasing the upper limit potential, the surface atomic fraction of Pd increases from 51.87% at 0.0 V to 62.42% at 0.8 V, and then decreases to

58.34% at 1.2 V, indicating that Pd surface segregation occurs when increasing the upper limit potential. Meanwhile, the fraction of metallic Pd (0) increases from 31.20% at 0.0 V to 36.79% at 0.8 V, and then decreases to 34.79% at 1.2 V, which is in accordance with the evolution of FOR catalytic activity as shown in Fig. 4. In addition, the fraction of Ag (I) does not decrease obviously despite the decrease of Ag fraction when increasing the upper limit potential from 0.0 to 0.8 V. Fig. 5d displays the valence band spectrum of the Ag<sub>49</sub>Pd<sub>51</sub>/rGO catalyst after FOR test at different upper limit potential for 10 cycles. The d-band centers of Ag<sub>49</sub>Pd<sub>51</sub>/rGO catalyst are located at 4.37, 4.52, 4.56 and 4.38 eV at different positive scan limit of 0.0, 0.4, 0.8 and 1.2 V, respectively. The farthest d-band centers of Ag<sub>49</sub>Pd<sub>51</sub>/rGO catalyst at 4.56 eV from the Fermi level is achieved through controlling the upper limit potential at 0.8 V, which can effectively reduce the adsorption of intermediates, and thereby improving the catalytic performance.<sup>37</sup>

Fig. 6a, 6c and Fig. S16 (Supporting information) shows the CV curves of Ag<sub>49</sub>Pd<sub>51</sub>/rGO and unsupported Ag<sub>51</sub>Pd<sub>49</sub> nanoalloy catalysts in 1 M KOH electrolyte after FOR test at different potential range, which can in-situ reveal the evolution on the surface of AgPd nanoparticles.<sup>54</sup> With the increase of upper limit potential, the area ratio of Pd oxide and Ag oxide peaks are various. Fig. 6b exhibits the area ratios of PdO and Ag<sub>2</sub>O reduction peaks in Ag<sub>49</sub>Pd<sub>51</sub>/rGO catalyst. Although there are large differences in the magnitude of these two peaks due to the difference in the reduction charge of PdO and Ag<sub>2</sub>O, the change of Ag/Pd area ratios could reflect the evolution of surface composition. As can be seen, the area percentage of PdO reduction for fresh Ag<sub>49</sub>Pd<sub>51</sub>/rGO catalyst is 86.27%, after FOR tests, the area percentage of PdO reduction increases rapidly, indicating the FOR process can make the internal Pd atoms migrate to the surface. Moreover, with the increase of upper limit potential from 0.0 V to 0.6 V, the area percentage of PdO increases from 98.16 to 99.45%, suggesting that the surface coverage of Pd is further increased. Further, on increasing the upper limit potential from 0.6 V to 1.2 V, the area percentage of PdO decreases from 99.45 to 97.51%, that is considered due to the oxidation of Ag is served, which is reported beneficial to catalytic FOR.37 Ag<sub>51</sub>Pd<sub>49</sub> nanoalloy exhibits the similar phenomenon after FOR test at different positive scan limit as is shown in Fig. 6d, whose area percentage of PdO first increases from 84.67% at 0.0 V to 92.21% at 0.6 V, and then decreases at 0.8 V. However, the area of Ag<sub>2</sub>O in Ag<sub>51</sub>Pd<sub>49</sub> nanoalloy is much higher than that of Ag<sub>49</sub>Pd<sub>51</sub>/rGO catalyst after FOR tests (Fig. 6b), which indicates that there are more Ag on the surface of Ag<sub>51</sub>Pd<sub>49</sub> nanoalloy to be oxidized and reduced than Ag<sub>49</sub>Pd<sub>51</sub>/rGO catalyst, further proving the effect of graphene support on promoting the surface segregation of Pd atoms.

Based on a comprehensive analysis of the above XPS, HRTEM and CV data, it can be concluded that during the process of FOR test, the internal Pd atoms segregate to the surface of AgPd nanoparticles. When the upper limit potential of CV treatment increases, the surface Pd fraction of  $Ag_{49}Pd_{51}/rGO$  increases more significantly, resulting in an enhancement in the electrocatalytic activity. However, when the upper limit

potential is too high, the corrosion of graphene supportuits accelerated and the generated high-valent 1Pd06xide N3 976000 difficult to be reduced (Fig. S17, Supporting information), resulting in a decrease in surface active sites, thereby causing a decrease in electrocatalytic performance.

Why do the internal Pd atoms segregate to the surface of AgPd nanoparticles? It has been reported that the oxidation of formate produces a large amount of H intermediate adsorbed on the surface of catalysts.<sup>52, 55</sup> As the upper limit potential in CV treatment increases, the surface oxidation of catalysts become more severe, accompanied with the decomposition of formate intensified, resulting in more H and O intermediates adsorbed on the surface of the catalyst.<sup>56, 57</sup> In addition, some previous theoretical work predicted that the adsorption of H and O should induce internal Pd to segregate to the surface of AgPd nanoparticles.<sup>35, 58</sup> Therefore, it can be deduced that the H and O adsorbates produced during CV treatment induce internal Pd atoms to segregate to the surface. With the increase of upper limit potential, the adsorption of H and O are intensified, resulting in more severe segregation, leading to the enhancement in catalytic performance. Furthermore, the enhancement in catalytic activity and the Pd surface segregation of  $Ag_{49}Pd_{51}/rGO$  catalyst are more obvious than unsupported Ag<sub>51</sub>Pd<sub>49</sub> nanoalloys with the increase of upper limit potential (Fig. 4 and Fig. 6), and the hydrogen desorption peak for Ag<sub>49</sub>Pd<sub>51</sub>/rGO catalyst raises when subjected to CV treatment in electrolyte of 1 M KOH (Fig. S18, Supporting information), while Ag<sub>51</sub>Pd<sub>49</sub> nanoalloy shows an opposite trend. Given that Ag itself has no activity in hydrogen oxidation,59 the magnitude of the hydrogen desorption peak can directly reflect the number of Pd active sites on surface. Therefore, the graphene support of Ag<sub>49</sub>Pd<sub>51</sub>/rGO catalyst exhibits a positive effect on increasing the number of Pd active sites for the supported AgPd nanoparticles during potential cycling. As a result, we hypothesize that it is due to the effect of C on graphene, which accompanied with H and O to induce the surface segregation of internal Pd.

In this study, Pd surface segregation is observed when increasing the upper limit potential from 0.0 to 0.8 V, it is noteworthy that the direction of surface segregation for nanoalloy catalysts is different under various condition. Take AuPd nanoparticles as example, some experimental results showed that Au surface segregation occurs under working condition, <sup>60, 61</sup> whereas Enache et al. <sup>62</sup> demonstrated that Pd surface segregation takes place during calcination, even some researchers reported that the surface segregation does not happen for AuPd nanoparticles. <sup>63</sup>

bottom 2 layers of Pd atoms fixed as the bulk, and the top 2 layers with totally 4 Ag and 4 Pd atoms are relaxed to move freely. Fig. 7a shows the segregation energy for the AgPd slab under the coverage of 1/4 ML of H, O and C. The segregation energy of one Pd subsurface atom to surface is 0.03 eV on a clean surface, which suggests the surface segregation of Ag. Once the surface is covered with 1/4 ML of H, O and C, the segregation energy of Pd changes sign from positive (0.03 eV) to negative (-0.26 eV for H, -0.36 eV for O and -1.16 eV for C), indicating the surface segregation of Pd. The effect of graphene support on surface segregation of AgPd nanoalloy is investigated by adsorbing 1/4 ML coverage of C atoms on the surface of AgPd slab because that the strong interaction between AgPd nanocluster and graphene makes the AgPd nanocluster severely deformed during the process of geometry optimization (Fig. S19, Supporting information). More detailed, the segregation energy of Pd atoms from Pd surface coverage of 0 to 100% are shown in Fig. 7b. As the surface coverage of Pd increases, the segregation energy increases under a clean surface, indicating the surface segregation is an upperhill process, while the segregation energy decreases when the surface is covered with 1/4 ML of H, O and C, which proves that the adsorption of H, O and C atoms can make the surface segregation of Pd atoms more favorable in terms of thermodynamics. Moreover, the adsorption of C has the most remarkable effect in comparison with H and O to induce the surface segregation of Pd atoms due to the maximum segregation energy, resulting in the more significant surface reconstruction for Ag<sub>49</sub>Pd<sub>51</sub>/rGO catalyst than Ag<sub>51</sub>Pd<sub>49</sub> nanoalloy.

The adsorption energy of H, O and C adsorbed onto Ag (111) and Pd (111) surface are calculated in Fig. 7c to further study the reason why surface segregation is more favorable on Pd than Ag surface. The adsorption energies of H, O and C adsorbed onto Pd (Ag) surface are -2.74 (-2.1), -4.21 (-3.73) and -6.14 (-3.36) eV, respectively. Obviously, Pd atoms has higher binding strength with H, O and C atoms than Ag atoms, the stronger metal-adsorbates interaction provides a diving force for the surface segregation of Pd. It is noteworthy that the adsorption energy difference between Pd and Ag surface is -0.64, -0.48 and -2.78 eV for H, O and C atom, the higher adsorption energy difference of C suggests that C is more attractive to Pd, leading to the more remarkable surface reconstruction for Ag<sub>49</sub>Pd<sub>51</sub>/rGO catalyst in comparison with unsupported Ag<sub>51</sub>Pd<sub>49</sub> nanoalloy.

Fig. 8 shows the potential energy profiles of one Pd subsurface atom migration to AgPd (111) surface under different surface conditions. The activation energy of segregating a subsurface Pd atom to the surface under the condition of clean surface and 1/4 ML coverage of H, O and C are 2.06, 1.62, 1.39 and 0.54 eV, respectively. It is obvious that the occurrence of Pd surface segregation is kinetically difficult in vacuum due to the activation barrier of up to 2.06 eV, which is in accordance with the positive segregation energy result in Fig. 7. When the surface is covered with 1/4 ML of H, O and C, the activation barrier decreases remarkably, demonstrating that the adsorption of H, O and C can make the surface segregation of Pd atoms become possible in terms of kinetics. Furthermore, the activation barrier of Pd surface segregation

under the coverage of 1/4 ML of C is significantly lower than that under the coverage of 1/4 ML of H and O, which indicates the effect of C for the surface segregation of Pd is greater than H and O. Combing with the thermodynamically results in Fig. 7, these kinetics results account for the surface reconstruction of AgPd nanoparticles and the facilitating effect of graphene support.

The possibility of Pd surface segregation in AgPd nanoparticles during CV process is further confirmed by the XPS and TEM results in Fig. S20, S21 and Table S3 (Supporting information). As is shown in Fig. S20 (Supporting information), the surface Pd coverage increases significantly from 48.34% to 68.15% after 10 cycles of CV treatment in 1 M KOH electrolyte, resulting in the raise in hydrogen desorption peak (Fig. S18, Supporting information). Fig. S21 (Supporting information) shows the HRTEM images for the Ag<sub>49</sub>Pd<sub>51</sub>/rGO catalyst before and after 10 cycles of CV in N2-saturated 1 M KOH electrolyte, which can also confirm the change on the surface of AgPd nanoparticles during CV process. Obviously, the d-spacing of the (111) plane for Ag<sub>49</sub>Pd<sub>51</sub>/rGO catalyst decreases from 0.2334 to 0.2278 nm during CV process. The d-spacing of Ag (111) and Pd (111) planes are 0.2359 and 0.2246 nm, it is inferred that the CV treatment make internal Pd atoms segregate to the surface of AgPd nanoparticles, leading to an increase in the surface Pd content, thereby shifting the d-spacing value close to Pd (111) plane and thus confirming the possibility of Pd surface segregation in potential cycling.

## Conclusions

In summary, the AgPd/rGO catalysts were successfully prepared by a one-pot microwave assisted synthesis method to catalyze FOR. The mass activity of Ag<sub>49</sub>Pd<sub>51</sub>/rGO catalyst is 6.38 times higher than Pd/C catalyst, and the Ag<sub>49</sub>Pd<sub>51</sub>/rGO shows a considerable durability after successive 500 cycles, whose residual mass activity is 13.98 times higher than that of

commercial Pd/C catalyst. The enhanced FOR performance of Ag<sub>49</sub>Pd<sub>51</sub>/rGO catalyst is benefited from the allowing effect of Ag with Pd and the large active surface area of graphene. In addition, the catalytic activity of Ag<sub>49</sub>Pd<sub>51</sub>/rGO catalyst increases from 2.32 to 6.03 A mg<sup>-1</sup><sub>Pd</sub> with increasing the upper limit potential in CV, and the less obvious activity enhancement is observed for Ag<sub>51</sub>Pd<sub>49</sub> nanoalloy. At the same time, the surface Pd content increases from 51.87% to 62.42% for Ag<sub>49</sub>Pd<sub>51</sub>/rGO catalyst, proving the occurrence of surface reconstruction. DFT calculation further indicates that upon adsorption of H, O, and C atoms on the surface of AgPd nanoalloys, the segregation energy of one subsurface Pd atom to surface is -0.26, -0.36 and -1.16 eV, the activation energy for the migration of Pd atom to surface is 1.62, 1.39 and 0.54 eV, respectively, which are lower than the segregation (0.03 eV) and activation (2.06 eV) energy on clean alloy surface and thus provide a thermodynamics diving force and kinetics path for the observed surface reconstruction. Furthermore, the more obvious surface reconstruction of  $Ag_{49}Pd_{51}/rGO$  catalyst than Ag<sub>51</sub>Pd<sub>49</sub> nanoalloy can be attributed to the stronger inducing effect of C than H and O atoms. It is believed that this work should provide an efficient application of formate as a product of CO<sub>2</sub> electrochemical reduction and a strategy to understand surface reconstruction to maximize catalytic performance.

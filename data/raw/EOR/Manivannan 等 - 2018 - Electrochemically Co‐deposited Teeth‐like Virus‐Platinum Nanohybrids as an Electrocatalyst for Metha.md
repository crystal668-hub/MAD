Abstract: M13 virus (M13) as scaffolds has a major appeal, owing to their mono-dispersed, fibrillar morphology and engineerable surface reactive sites. Herein we had developed a facile electrocatalyst for energy application. Platinum nanostructures are directly co-deposited from a wild-type M13 (or) two different engineered M13 mixed electrolytes onto the ITO electrodes. The engineered M13 with 4E peptides could specifically nucleate Pt precursor thereby enables the efficient growth of teethlike structures at the ITO electrode. The electrocatalytic activity of the resulting electrocatalyst toward methanol oxidation in alkaline medium was investigated and found enhanced mass activity (0.321 A/mgPt) relative to the catalyst prepared from wild-type M13, Y3E peptides engineered M13 and without M13. Our novel electrocatalyst fabrication can be extended to other metal and metal oxides and its application might be useful to develop novel clean and green energy generating and storage materials.

Biogenic scaffolds offer outstanding platform for nanomaterials known as functional bionanohybrids. In particular, engineering at the biogenic surface to pre-concentrate the transition metal precursors can influence innovation in different fields, including energy materials and sensor platforms [1, 2]. Among different biogenic scaffolds including viruses, DNA, proteins, and microorganisms, M13 viruses (M13) have shown the various advantages in biotemplating due to its mono-dispersion, fibrillar morphology, multivalent and tunable structural features, biocompatibility, low-cost production, and high stability [3–5]. The functionality of its subunit proteins can be engineered to identify and display peptides that have a good binding affinity and specificity toward target molecules [6, 7]. Hence, M13 based biogenic scaffolds can be bio-alternative to regular material templates to engineer the biologically activated catalysts with the integrated structural features. On the other hand, direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) operating in alkaline medium having noticeable features such as improved reaction kinetics, less corrosive environment for catalysts and can proceed at lower potential [8–11].

Herein we show the straight forward biotemplated Pt nanostructures (NSs) by electrochemical co-deposition from the electrolyte mixed with wild-type M13 (M13wild) (or) Y3E peptides engineered M13 (M13Y3E) (or) 4E peptides engineered M13 (M134E) through complementary-charge attraction forces. Structure of the M13wild and M134E are represented in Figure 1. In the biotemplated fabrication of Pt nanostructures (NSs), M13 viruses were first mixed with Pt precursors. Then constant potential of -0.2 V was applied for 500 s, to electrodeposit the Pt NSs on Glassy Carbon (GC) electrode. Figure 2 reveals the structural changes observed when Pt NSs were codeposited from the M13 mixed electrolytes. It is obvious that Pt NSs deposited in the absence of M13, presence of M13, and M13Y3E shows the more of spherical particles (Figure 2(A, A1), (B, B1) and (C, C1)) in contrary Pt NSs co-deposited from the, M134E exhibited the high surface roughness and teeth-like morphology (Figure 2D, D1). In all the four different cases particle size observed between 0.5 and 1.5 mm. Since this co-deposition was carried out in the absence of any solid/matrix support hence stability of the Pt NSs at the bare ITO electrode surface become questionable. In this regard, major coat protein of the M13 and engineered peptides sequences of the M13Y3E and M134E serving as biosolid supports thereby providing effective nucleation and stabilization for the co-deposited Pt NSs. Furthermore, the cation binding ability of the 4Epeptides engineered at the M134E had attracted the Pt precursor towards it and offered the nucleation sites and allowed to grow around it. Such binding followed by a nucleation sites were not available with the M13wild and M13Y3E due to their different surface functionalities. Since the bare ITO surface is Piranha treated which is rich in -OH-like oxygen and indium species which can easily enables the active interaction between ITO and M13 via

Biotemplated synthesis of Pt NSs was optimized in terms of M13<sub>4E</sub> concentration. At low concentrations

(0.05 mg/mL and 0.1 mg/mL) no teeth-like structure was found (Figure S1A and B). Rather increased surface roughness was found for 0.1 mg/mL of M13<sub>4F</sub>. Teeth-like NSs of Pt were formed at 0.2 mg/mL and 0.3 mg/mL of M13<sub>4E</sub>, hence 0.2 mg/mL is the critical concentration of M13<sub>4E</sub> to both attract the precursors and initiate the teethlike Pt NSs nucleation and growth. Furthermore, EDX analysis (Figure S1E to E2) of the ITO/Pt<sub>4E-0.2</sub> electrode summarizes the elemental mapping in which clearly distinguishable Pt and N regions were seen and confirming that the NSs were composed of metallic Pt. Comparison in Figure S2 reveals that, N which is aroused from the engineered major coat Protein of the M134E and confirming the active immobilization of M134E at the electrode surface. The XRD patterns of ITO/Pt, ITO/Pt<sub>wild-0.2</sub>, ITO/ Pt<sub>Y3E-0.2</sub> and ITO/Pt<sub>4E-0.2</sub> electrodes were shown in Figure S3. In all the electrodes peaks at 30.4°, 35.3°, 50.9° and 60.4° (JCPDS card number 39-1058) were observed which aroused from the ITO electrode and thereby those peaks are neglected in the analysis. Peaks observed at 39.9°,  $46.4^{\circ}$ ,  $67.9^{\circ}$  and  $74.2^{\circ}$  are attributed to the (111), (200), (220) and (311) crystalline planes, respectively of the fcc crystal structure of Pt.

Methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) in alkaline medium is used as a model system to explore the electrocatalytic activity of modified electrodes and the results are summarized in Figures 3, S4-S6 and Table 1. Even though Pt is an expensive metal, still rational synthesis of Pt NSs with suitable bio/solid/matrix support and having very high electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) is greatly demanded and very promising for enhancing both performance and durability for MOR. To analyse the electrocatalytic ability of the aforementioned catalysts, both ECSA ( $m^2/g_{Pt}$ ) and specific mass ( $mg_{Pt}/cm^2$ ) parameters were derived and given in Table 1. Figure 3A, clearly representing characteristic hydrogen adsorption (forward scan) and desorption (reverse scan) peaks between -0.2and 0 V. The electrocatalytic activities of the ITO/Pt<sub>4E</sub> electrode fabricated at different M13<sub>4E</sub> concentrations toward MOR were evaluated by CV in 0.1 M CH<sub>3</sub>OH+ 0.1 M KOH and are shown in Figure 3. From Figure 3B in terms of mass activity, the ITO/Pt4E electrode fabricated with the 0.2 mg/mL of  $M13_{4E}$  exhibited (Figure 3B(c)) improved electrocatalytic activity then the others. The higher ECSA aroused due to the high surface roughness

of the teeth-like NSs was responsible for the improved catalytic activity of the ITO/Pt4E0.2 electrode. Such surface roughness hence, improved ECSA was not available with the electrodes fabricated with other M13 viruses. Figure 3C represents the comparison of ITO/Pt4E-0.2 electrode in the absence (a) and presence of (b) 0.1 M CH3OH. To observe the stability, 100 continuous cycles at ITO/Pt4E-0.2 electrode for MOR is carried out (Figure 3D). After 100 cycles around 25.3% of peak current has decreased which indicates that the proposed electrocatalyst shows reasonable sensitivity and better stability toward MOR. As shown in Figure S4B and in Table 1, mass activity of the ITO/Pt4E-0.2 electrode is high compared to catalysts fabricated in the absence of M13, M13wild and M134E. Kinetics studies at the ITO/Pt4E-0.2 electrode (Figure S5), revealed that while increasing the scan rate, the peak potential is shifted to a more positive potential due to the irreversible electrode process of the methanol oxidation reaction. Furthermore to investigate the kinetics of MOR at ITO/Pt4E-0.2 electrode, relationships of anodic peak current (jp) and peak potential (Ep) as a function of different scan rates (n) obtained from forward CV scans have studied and shown in Figure S5. It is observed that the electrode exhibits linear relationship (Figure S5B) between log j and log n and the slope approximated at 0.0452. Besides, slopes were lying between 0 and 0.5, indicating that MOR at all the electrodes has been diffusion controlled process. In addition linear relationship (Figure S5C) between Ep and log (n) indicates that MOR is an irreversible charge transfer process.

Thus, the improved electrochemical response of proposed electrocatalyst can be ascribed to the following aspects: (i) From a structural perspective, these Pt NSs possess high surface roughness when compared to the absence of M13, M13wild and M13Y3E (Figure 2) led to improved ECSA. (ii) electrocatalyst prepared with 0.3 mg/ mL of M134E also exhibit the teeth-like structures but showing less mass activity than the one prepared with 0.2 mg/mL, the reason can be more M134E attracts the more Pt mass hence it showing less activity. (iii) In the MOR in alkaline medium, reaction with OHads being the rate determining step. Major coat protein and engineered

peptide sequences (4E) could have efficiently attract the OHads thereby facilitating an OHads rich environment. Hence, an effective reaction between CH3COads and OHads could have occurred and contributed to the high electrocatalytic activity [5]. (iv) We rationalized that the observed catalytic enhancement was possibly due to electronic effect between Pt NSs and bare ITO electrode surface (absence of any matrix) and the presence of neighbouring M13 which can alter work function of Pt NSs and increased the catalytic activity via strong binding with MeOH and enhances its oxidation. (v) While considering the functionalization of M134E (E: glutamic acid), the interacting abilities of glutamic acid with MeOH further supports the enhanced catalytic activity. All these factors clearly demonstrate that the proposed teeth-like electrocatalyst co-deposited with M134E can possess advantageous structural aspects that would impart improved catalytic performance toward MOR. Hence, the binding peptides engineered at the major coat protein of M13 evidently contributing the nucleation, growth and catalytic activity. CVs of the commercial Pt/C and ITO/ Pt4E-0.2 electrode for the MOR were obtained in a solution of 0.1 M CH3OH and 0.1 M KOH at a scan rate of 50 mV/ s are shown in Figure S6. The peak current densities of the Pt/C and ITO/Pt4E-0.2 electrode during the forward scan reached 0.23 A/mg Pt and 0.32 A/mg Pt, respectively. The MOR mass current density of the ITO/Pt4E-0.2 electrode was 1.4-fold higher than that of the commercial Pt/C catalyst.

We have demonstrated M134E-templated fabrication of Pt NSs directly at the electrode surface by electrodeposition, with well spatial separation, teeth-like morphologies, and high crystallinity. This biotemplating technique of electrodeposition is distinguished from the conventional method for bio mineralizing metal NSs in solution phase which involve the use of metal precursor, reducing agents and stabilizing agents and do not effectively control the size and morphology. Furthermore, surface of the NSs synthesized by solution phase are passivated by either reducing or stabilizing agents. Since our biotemplating was done by electrodeposition from the M13 mixed electrolytes which can provide highly crystalline and pure biotemplated NSs. The typical teeth-like structure indicates that nucleation and growth of Pt takes place exclusively with the assistance of M134E.

#### Experimental

Chloroplatinic acid hexahydrate (H2PtCl6 \* 6H2O) was received from Sigma-Aldrich. Methanol (MeOH) was obtained from DaeJung chemicals. The commercial Pt/C catalyst (20% Pt/C) was received from Alfa Aesar. Indium tin oxide (ITO, (dimension; 2 3 1 cm)) were used as working electrodes. Pt wire served as a counter electrode and Ag/AgCl (in 3 M NaCl solution) was used as a reference electrode. All the electrochemical experiments were conducted in a single compartment three electrode cell using an Ivium Technologies electrochemical work station. Nitrogen (N2) was bubbled for 30 minutes prior to each experiment. M13 viruses' growth, purification and amplification were carried out by following standard biochemical protocols described in literature [5, 12–16] and it is given in the supporting information. Pt NSs were electrodeposited on ITO electrode from the electrolyte (mixture of 3 mM of H2PtCl6 and 0.02 mg/mL of M13wild or M13Y3E or M134E in 0.5 M H2SO4 by applying the potential of -0.2 V (Ag/AgCl) for 500 s. Fabricated electrodes was denoted as ITO/Pt or ITO/Ptwild-0.2 or ITO/ PtY3E-0.2 or ITO/Pt4E-0.2. Current was monitored during deposition and charge (Q) was used to estimate specific mass (M) of Pt using the eq 1.

$$M = Q \times MW/(n FA) \tag{1}$$

where 'M' is specific mass after electrodeposition, 'Q' is charge consumed for electrodeposition, 'MW' is the molecular mass of Pt, 'n' is number of electrons (4) transferred for electrodeposition, 'F' is Faraday constant and 'A' is geometrical area (0.44 cm<sup>2</sup> ) of the electrode ('O' ring). The mass of Pt was used to calculate the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) and normalizing the current to obtain current density plots. The ECSA of the modified electrodes were calculated by integrating (MATLAB curve fitting tool) the Q of hydrogen adsorption curve after eliminating non-faradaic current, which was recorded in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution (saturated with nitrogen) scanned at 50 mV/s from -0.4 to 1.2 V. The electrocatalytic performance of the modified electrodes toward MOR was studied by recording cyclic voltammograms (CV) in 0.1 M KOH+0.1 M CH3OH solution scanned at 50 mV/s from -1 to 0.6 V. An electrochemical durability of the catalyst was measured by recording the potential CV cycles.

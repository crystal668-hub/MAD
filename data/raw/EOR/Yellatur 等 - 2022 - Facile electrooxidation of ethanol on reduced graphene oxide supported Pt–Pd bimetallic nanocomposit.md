### **Abstract**

Development of electrocatalysts with extended homogeneity and improved metal–support interactions is of urgent scientific need in the context of electrochemical energy applications. Herein, bimetallic Pt–Pd nanoparticles with good homogeneity are fabricated using a convenient solution phase chemical reduction method onto a reduced graphene oxide (rGO) support. X-ray diffraction studies revealed that Pt–Pd/rGO possesses the crystallite size of 3.1 nm. The efficacies of Pt–Pd/rGO catalyst (20 wt% Pt + 10 wt% Pd on rGO support, Pt:Pd atomic ratio = 1:1) towards ethanol electrooxidation reaction (EOR) are evaluated in acidic conditions by cyclic voltammetry using catalyst-coated glassy carbon electrode as a working electrode. With the better dispersion on rGO support the Pt–Pd/rGO nancomposite catalyst exhibit highest mass specific activity (0.358 mA/ $\mu$ g-Pt) which is observed to be 1.9 times of similarly synthesized 20 wt% Pt/rGO (0.189 mA/ $\mu$ g-Pt) and 2.5 times of commercial 20 wt% Pt/C (0.142 mA/ $\mu$ g-Pt), respectively. Apart from the observed improved EOR activity, the Pt–Pd/rGO catalyst exhibited better stability than Pt/rGO and Pt/C catalysts. Strong synergy offered by Pt, Pd and rGO support could contribute to the observed higher EOR activity of Pt–Pd/rGO.

### Introduction

Energy conversion and storage through fuel cell technologies and batteries, respectively is considered to be one of the foremost options to meet the clean energy demand and utilization to tackle climatic issues [1–3]. Fuel cell technology is witnessing accelerating growth in both the automobile and stationary energy sectors [4, 5]. Proton exchange membrane fuel cells

(PEMFCs) operated by either hydrogen or by small organic molecules like CH<sub>3</sub>OH, HCOOH, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OH is considered to be promising energy sources for many applications due to its promising energy efficiency and small weight and volume [6–8] compared to other types of fuel cells. In particular, exploration of ethanol as a fuel is interesting due to the feasibility of large-scale production of ethanol from sugar-containing materials. Further, energy density of ethanol (8 kWh Kg $^{-1}$ )

is close to hydrocarbons (10–11 kWh Kg<sup>-1</sup>) making it suitable to use as a fuel for energy applications [9]. Successful deployment of fuel cell devices heavily depends on high performance electrocatalysts used at anode as well as at cathode compartments [10, 11]. Typically, expensive platinum based electrocatalysts with platinum loadings up to 60 wt% on conductive carbon supports are used to achieve affordable reaction kinetics of fuel cell reactions [12, 13].

To circumvent the problems associated with high cost of platinum, several approaches like finding non-noble electrocatalysts or maximizing the utilization of platinum by uniformly dispersing Pt-based particles on conductive carbon supports are documented in the literature [14–19]. Bimetallic nanoparticles with varied structures like coreshell, intermetallic (alloyed), heterostructured were believed to offer convenient electronic and geometric configurations required to achieve higher electrocatalytic efficacies towards methanol and ethanol electrooxidation [20]. Accordingly, several bimetallic structures like Pt-Au, Pt-Ag, Pt-Ru, Pt-Pd and Pt-Ni were well explored with good CO tolerance and lowered Pt-loadings to improve the electrochemical activity [21-28]. In addition, depositing bimetallic nanoparticles on to optimized carbon structures like graphene nanosheets, carbon nanotubes, and carbon nanoribbons etc yields high performance electrocatalysts for fuel cell reactions [29–32]. By judicious combination of platinum-based metal particles and conductive carbon structures electrocatalysts with higher catalytic efficiencies can be achieved for fuel cell reactions.

The aim of the present work is to deposit platinum-palladium bimetallic particles on a reduced graphene oxide support (rGO). To achieve this aim, a simple liquid-phase chemical reduction method incorporating ethylene glycol (EG) as a size-controlling agent, solvent as well as a reducing agent is demonstrated. Morphological, structural features and information on elemental compositions of fabricated electrocatalysts are assessed from electron microscopy and x-ray techniques. The electrocatalytic activity and stability of Pt-Pd/rGO towards EOR is studied and compared with the Pt/C (commercial) and Pt/rGO in nitrogen-saturated 0.5 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> + 1 M C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OH by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and chronoamperometry (CA). The controlled reducing ability offered by EG yields higher ethanol electrooxidation activity to both Pt-Pd/rGO compared to Pt/rGO and commercial Pt/C catalysts demonstrating the ability of the synthesis method adapted in achieving uniform dispersion of Pt-Pd on rGO sheets for electrocatalytic applications.

### **Experimental**

### Materials

Graphite flakes, H<sub>2</sub>PtCl<sub>6</sub>.6H<sub>2</sub>O, Pd(CH<sub>3</sub>COO)<sub>2</sub> were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. KMnO<sub>4</sub>, NaNO<sub>3</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and ethylene glycol (EG) were purchased from Merck, India. Pt/C (20 wt% Pt on Vulcan carbon) was obtained from Alfa-Aesar. All the chemicals were used as-received.

### Synthesis of graphene oxide (GO)

An oxidative exfoliation strategy based on modified Hummers' method was adapted to synthesize GO from natural graphite [33]. The procedure involves dispersion of graphite powder (ca. 3 g) into conc. H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> (120 ml) in a round-bottom flask. Later, appropriate amounts of sodium nitrate (6.0 g) and KMnO<sub>4</sub> (12 g) were slowly introduced under moderate stirring for 4 h in ice-cold conditions (0 °C). After this step, the temperature of the reaction mixture was increased to 60 °C and kept constant for 4 h. Then, the mixture was diluted by adding deionized water (500 ml). As a last step, 30% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (10 ml) was added to the reaction mixture to complete the oxidative exfoliation of graphene layers to produce GO layers. The GO powder was filtered through centrifugation at 6000 rpm and allowed to multiple washings with deionized water till pH of supernatant become neutral. The final GO powder was dried in a hot-air oven at 60 °C.

# Synthesis of bimetallic Pt-Pd/rGO and monometallic Pt/rGO nanocomposites

To prepare Pt-Pd/rGO catalysts, first GO powder (70 mg) was uniformly dispersed into ethylene glycol (30 ml) under ultrasonication for 1 h. Later, H<sub>2</sub>PtCl<sub>6</sub>.6H<sub>2</sub>O (51.47 mg) was dissolved in EG (35 ml) and Pd(CH<sub>3</sub>COO)<sub>2</sub> (22.36 mg) was also dissolved in EG (35 ml), separately. Weights of Pt and Pd precursor salts were calculated to yield 20 wt% Pt + 10 wt% Pd on rGO. Later, metal ions (Pt<sup>+4</sup> and Pd<sup>+2</sup>) containing EG solutions were mixed and introduced into the GO/EG solution and exposed to ultrasonication. Finally, the reaction mixture pH was adjusted to 12 by NaOH and refluxed at 120 °C (3 h). At this stage, bimetallic Pt-Pd particles were deposited onto rGO sheets due to the simultaneous reduction of Pt<sup>+4</sup> and Pd<sup>+2</sup> ions and GO. The catalyst thus obtained was named as Pt-Pd/ rGO. Later, Pt-Pd/rGO was washed with ethanol/water mixture (50:50 v/v) and dried in a hot air oven at 60 °C for 12 h. Pd/rGO (10 wt% Pd/rGO), and Pt/rGO (20 wt% Pt on rGO) catalysts were also prepared using the similar approach using respective metal precursors.

### Physical characterization of electrocatalysts

X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained using RigakuUltima IV x-ray diffractometer operated at 40 kV and 30 mA. Ni-filtered Cu–K $\alpha$  radiation with a wavelength ( $\lambda$ ) of 1.541 Å was used as an x-ray source. To assess morphological details and size distribution of the synthesized catalysts, electron microscopy (TEM and HRTEM) measurements were performed on a JEOL JEM-2100 plus high resolution transmission electron microscope (JEOL, JAPAN). The samples for electron microscopy analyses were prepared by dispersing in ethanol under ultrasonication and drop cast on to a carboncoated copper grid. Energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis were performed using a JEOL IT500 scanning electron microscopy (SEM) equipped with Ametek's EDAX detector. Electrocatalysts loadings on GCE were obtained through ICP-OES analysis using an ICP-OES spectrometer (Model: Optima 5300 DV, Perkin Elmer, USA).

### Electrochemical measurements

Electrocatalytic activity measurements of commercial Pt/C and in-house synthesized Pt/rGO and Pt-Pd/rGO catalysts towards ethanol were recorded at room temperature using a CHI 6002E electrochemical analyzer (CH Instruments Inc., Texas, USA) equipped with a three-electrode cell. Catalystcoated glassy carbon electrode (GCE) was used as a working electrode. The GCE diameter was 3 mm with a geometric area 0.0706 cm<sup>2</sup>. Prior to electrochemical measurements, the GCE working electrode was polished with an alumina slurry (alumina powder particle size is 1.0, 0.5 and 0.05  $\mu$ m) and exposed to ultrasonication and washed with ethanol and water. The composition of catalyst ink consists of calculated amount of catalyst powder, 700  $\mu$ l ethanol, 800  $\mu$ l water and  $100 \mu l$  of 0.05% Nafion (as a binder). The entire catalyst ink suspension was ultrasonicated to ensure better homogeneity. Later, 5  $\mu$ l of catalyst ink was drop-casted onto GCE and allowed to dry naturally at room temperature. The final catalyst loadings on GCE as determined from ICP-OES were  $1.82 \mu g-Pt/cm^2$ ,  $1.82 \mu g-Pt/cm^2$ , and  $1.78 \mu g-Pt/cm^2$ , for Pt/C, Pt/rGO, and Pt-Pd/RGO catalysts, respectively. A silver/silver chloride (satd. KCl) and Pt-wire were used as reference and counter electrodes, respectively. All the potentials represented in this work is against to Ag/AgCl (satd. KCl) which is having the value of 0.197 V with respect to standard hydrogen electrode. Ethanol electrooxidation studies were performed through CV in  $H_2SO_4$  (0.5 M) +  $C_2H_5OH$  (1 M) solution under nitrogen-saturation in the potential range -0.2to 1.2 V at the scan rate of 50 mV  $s^{-1}$ . To assess, the electrochemical durability of the catalysts, chronoamperometry (CA) analysis was performed in  $H_2SO_4$  (0.5 M) +  $C_2H_5OH$  (1 M) solutions at 0.68 V (scan rate 50 mV s<sup>-1</sup>).

### Physical characterization of electrocatalysts

Structural and morphological features of the electrocatalysts obtained through electron microscopy (transmission electron microscopy including high resolution TEM) and EDS are presented in figure 1. From the TEM image of figures 1(a)–(c), it is observed that Pt–Pd nanoparticles are directly nucleated and grown over the rGO surface and no unsupported particles are formed. Further, to support the formation of Pt–Pd nanoparticles on rGO support TEM images of various resolutions are presented in supporting information (figure 1(S) (available online at stacks.iop.org/NANO/33/335401/mmedia)). The particles deposited on graphene support are of polydisperse in nature with nanoscale dimensions. It is well documented in the literature that ethylene glycol has profound influence on the thermodynamic as well as kinetic control of nanocrystal growth [34].

Stable complexes formed between Pt (IV) and OH<sup>-</sup> from the added base during the polyol synthesis makes the reduction lower and finally control the particle size [35, 36]. Under the experimental conditions of the present study, EG offers slower growth rates to allow the formation of nanoparticles on rGO support. The fair homogeneity certainly improves

catalyst's electrochemically active surface area and makes it as a suitable electrocatalyst for electrooxidation of ethanol as discussed in the preceding sections.

Further, the HRTEM images of Pt-Pd/rGO (figures 1(d) and (e)) show the crystalline nanoparticles formed on rGO substrate. The calculated lattice spacing 0.224 nm is wellmatched with the value of (111) facets of alloyed Pt-Pd nanoparticles [37]. The SAED pattern (figure 1(f)) shows (hkl) indices related to Pt-Pd nanoparticles. Finally, the elemental distribution of Pt, Pd, C, and O in Pt-Pd/rGO catalyst assessed from EDS is shown in figure 1(g). Presence of Pt. Pd. C and O is clearly seen from the EDS. Presence of Cu in the EDS scan of all the samples is from the carbon-coated copper grid utilized during the EDS measurements. Further, elemental mapping obtained from SEM is also confirms the presence of Pt, Pd, C and O in Pt-Pd/rGO catalyst (figure 2(S) of supporting information). The atomic composition of Pt:Pd in Pt-Pd/rGO is found to be 52:48 indicating that Pt:Pd nominal atomic ratio close to 1:1. The nominal atomic composition of Pt:Pd obtained from ICP-OES is calculated to be 49:51. The nominal atomic composition obtained from ICP-OES studies are nearly matched with EDS results indicating that Pt-Pd/rGO catalyst owns Pt:Pd ratio close to 1:1.

Formation of GO, RGO and crystalline structure of Pt/ rGO, Pd/rGO, Pt-Pd/rGO electrocatalysts is assessed from XRD analysis as presented in figures 2(a) and (b). Appearance of reflex at  $2\theta$  vale between  $10^{\circ}$  and  $10.5^{\circ}$  with an interlattice spacing (d-spacing) close to 0.76 nm in case of GO is ascribed to the diffraction from a typical C(002) (figure 2(a)). Usually, the C (002) reflex of natural graphite possess d-spacing of 0.336 nm [38]. Exposing graphite with strong oxidizing agents like KMnO<sub>4</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> and NaNO<sub>3</sub> used during the synthesis of GO introduces oxygen-containing functional groups into the layers thereby increasing its inter-lattice distance consistent with the literature reports [39]. Further, upon partial reduction of GO to form rGO the C(002) reflex is positioned at  $2\theta^{\circ}$ –25°. The d-spacing associated with C(002) reflex is 0.364 nm indicates the restoration of sp<sup>2</sup> network and crystalline structure. The Pt/rGO exhibits diffraction reflexes at  $2\theta$  values 39.8°, 46.4°, 67.6°, 81.4° and 86.2° can be indexed to typical (111), (200), (220), (311), (222) planes related to the face-centred-cubic (fcc) structure of Pt (JCPDS file of 04-0802). Further, Pd/rGO sample too exhibits diffraction reflexes related to fcc structure located at  $2\theta$  values  $40.5^{\circ}$ ,  $46.6^{\circ}$ ,  $68.1^{\circ}$ ,  $81.6^{\circ}$  and  $86.4^{\circ}$  can be indexed to (111), (200), (220), (311), (222) planes(JCPDS 46-1043) confirming the formation of Pd on rGO support.

Home-made Pt–Pd/rGO electrocatalyst exhibit diffraction reflexes of Pt–Pd (111), (200), (220), (311), and (222) at  $2\theta$  values of  $40.0^{\circ}$ ,  $46.5^{\circ}$ ,  $67.9^{\circ}$ ,  $81.5^{\circ}$  and  $86.3^{\circ}$ , respectively. Further, in case of bimetallic Pt–Pd/rGO, (111) diffraction reflex is located between the Pd(111) of Pd/rGO and Pt(111) of Pt/rGO signifying the formation of alloy-like structure [40]. Utilizing the full width at half maximum associated with (220) peak, the crystallite size of Pt–Pd/rGO is calculated using Scherrer formula [40]. The crystallite size of the Pt–Pd/rGO is calculated to be 3.1 nm which falls under catalytically active particle size regime.

### Electrochemical analysis of the catalysts

Understanding the surface cleanliness and electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) is important to evaluate catalysts electrochemical performance. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) more often used as a sensitive method to understand the electrocatalyst surfaces [41]. CVs of the Pt/C, Pt/rGO, and Pt-Pd/ rGO electrocatalysts were recorded in nitrogen-saturated H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> (0.5 M) and shown in figure 3. All the catalysts exhibit typical  $H_2$ -adsorption and  $H_2$ -desorption in the region -0.12to 0.11 V versus Ag/AgCl (satd. KCl). Presence of distinct peaks in H-adsorption and desorption signifies promising surface quality of the catalysts. Slightly irregular CV features appeared in case of Pt-Pd/rGO and Pt/rGO catalysts in the double-layer region are likely caused by the available oxygencontaining functionalities associated with rGO support [42]. ECSA values are calculated by hydrogen under potential deposition method [43, 44] as shown in supporting information.

From the calculations, bimetallic Pt–Pd/rGO possess highest ECSA of 79.9  $\pm$  0.15  $m^2$   $g^{-1}$  compared to Pt/rGO (63.4  $\pm$  0.11  $m^2$   $g^{-1}$ ) and Pt/C (59.1  $\pm$  0.14  $m^2$   $g^{-1}$ ). Smaller Pt–Pd particles with improved dispersion on rGO support as revealed by TEM results might be contributed to the observed higher ECSA in case of Pt–Pd/rGO. Higher electrochemical activity can be anticipated for Pt–Pd/rGO compared to the other catalysts.

# Electrochemical ethanol oxidation on Pt-Pd/rGO, Pt/rGO and Pt/C nanoparticles

To develop direct ethanol fuel cells as versatile clean energy sources, electrocatalysts capable of oxidizing ethanol with high activity and promising stability is required [45]. Electrooxidation of ethanol was studied on Pt/C, Pt/rGO and Pt–Pd/rGO in  $H_2SO_4$  (0.5 M) +  $C_2H_5OH$  (1 M) solution and corresponding ethanol oxidation CV profiles were shown in

**Figure 3.** Cyclic voltammograms of Pt/C, Pt/rGO and Pt–Pd/rGO recorded in nitrogen-saturated  $H_2SO_4$  (0.5 M) at a scan rate 50 mV s<sup>-1</sup>.

figure 4. The CV scans exhibit typical forward and backward peaks related to the electoroxidation of ethanol and removal of carbonaceous-based intermediates that are not fully oxidized during forward scan, respectively (figures 4(a) and (b)) consistent with literature [46]. Compared to the monometallic Pt/rGO and Pt/C (commercial), the Pt-Pd/rGO catalyst exhibit higher onset potential ( $E_{onset}$ ) as well as peak current signifying that the bimetallic/rGO configuration owns improved EOR activity. The observed trends in  $(E_{onset})$ indicate that Pt-Pd/rGO exhibit early onset of EOR (0.42 V) when compared to Pt/rGO (0.55 V) and Pt/C (0.62 V). Further, the ratio of forward peak current  $(I_{fp})$  to backward peak current  $(I_{bp})$  is used as a descriptor to assess the COtolerance of the electrocatalyst [47, 48]. Normally, higher  $I_{\rm fp}/I_{\rm bp}$  indicates the catalyst can tolerate CO-like species poisoning and facile oxidation of fuel can be anticipated. The calculated  $I_{\rm fp}/I_{\rm bp}$  values follow the order Pt–Pd/rGO (1.50) > Pt/rGO (0.99) > Pt/C (0.93) indicating Pt-Pd/ rGO catalyst is good in CO-resistance. The EOR activities of electrocatalysts presented as two parameters, i.e. the 'massspecific current density  $(j_{\text{mass}})$ ' and 'specific area current density ( $j_{\text{specific}}$ )' obtained by dividing  $j_{\text{mass}}$  with ECSA are compared in figure 4(c). The Pt-Pd/rGO catalyst exhibit highest  $j_{\text{mass}}$  (0.358 mA/ $\mu$ g-Pt) which is observed to be 1.9 times of Pt/rGO (0.189 mA/ $\mu$ g-Pt) and 2.5 times of commercial Pt/C (0.142 mA/µg-Pt), respectively. In addition, Pt-Pd/rGO catalyst shows highest j<sub>specific</sub> (0.448 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>) which is observed to be 1.5 times of Pt/rGO  $(0.299 \text{ mA cm}^{-2})$  and 1.9 times of commercial Pt/C  $(0.240 \text{ m}^{-2})$ mA cm<sup>-2</sup>), respectively.

Thus, the electrochemical activity parameters imply that electrooxidation of ethanol is more facile on Pt–Pd/rGO catalyst compared to Pt/rGO and Pt/C. The improved EOR activity on Pt–Pd/rGO is attributed to the synergy offered by both Pt and Pd as well as rGO support. Although, Pd surface is known to possess less capacity in C–C bond cleavage [49], however addition of palladium to platinum promotes

<span id="page-6-0"></span>**Figure 4.** Electrochemical oxidation of ethanol (a) CV curves (i-V) in nitrogen-saturated  $H_2SO_4$  (0.5 M) +  $C_2H_5OH$  (1 M), (b) CV curves represented as current density (current normalized with loading of electrocatalyst), (c) mass-specific current density ( $mA/\mu g$ -Pt) versus specific current density ( $mA/\mu g$ -Pt) versus specific current density ( $mA/\mu g$ -Pt), and (d) chronoamperometry profiles recorded in nitrogen-saturated  $H_2SO_4$  (0.5 M) +  $C_2H_5OH$  (1 M) solution at 0.68 V of Pt-Pd/rGO, Pt/rGO and commercial Pt/C electrocatalysts.

bifunctional effect where in Pt surface dehydrogenate ethanol to produce carbonaceous intermediates and Pd surfaces offers oxygenated species required for the oxidation of carbonaceous intermediates [50, 51]. Further, addition of Pd appears to modulate electronic structure of Pt required for favorable electrooxidation of ethanol and accumulated carbonaceous intermediates on platinum surfaces [52].

Electrochemical stability of the catalysts is assessed from chronoamperometry performed in H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> (0.5 M) + C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OH (1 M) at 0.68 V and presented in figure 4(d). It is observed that current retention over the studied time is more on Pt-Pd/ rGO compared to Pt/C and Pt/rGO indicating that the catalyst possesses superior stability towards ethanol electrooxidation. As can be seen from figure 4(d), sudden diminution of current during initial times on all the electrocatalysts is attributed to surface coverage of carbonaceous intermediates (incomplete suppression of the C1 and C2 intermediates adsorbed on the electrocatalyst surface) formed during ethanol oxidation [53]. The simple ethylene glycol chemical reduction utilized for the fabrication of Pt-Pd/rGO electrocatalyst offers more homogeneity and better attachment of nanoparticles to rGO sheet make it suitably stable under the experimental conditions. Utilization of the Pt-Pd/rGO catalyst in real direct ethanol fuel cell fabrication may offer better electrochemical power density.

### **Conclusions**

In summary, Pt-Pd/rGO nanoparticles were prepared by a facile solution phase chemical reduction method. The method vields Pt-Pd bimetallic particles with a crystallite size of 3.1 nm on an rGO support. As a result of improved dispersion, the resultant Pt-Pd/rGO possess higher ECSA (79.9  $\pm$ 0.15 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>) required for the enhancement of EOR activity. The Pt-Pd/rGO is promising in improving EOR activity as assessed from superior mass-specific and surface area-specific activities when compared to the similarly prepared Pt/rGO and commercial Pt/C catalysts. Coexistence of Pt and Pd on rGO support offers bifunctional and electronic effects in addition to synergistic interaction of Pt-Pd and rGO support and play a positive role in improving the catalyst's activity towards EOR. Further optimization of Pt-Pd/rGO in terms of composition and loadings will be beneficial in deploying it as an anode catalyst for direct ethanol fuel cells.

#### **Abstract:**

Carbonaceous poisoning and poor catalytic activity of catalysts are two crucial challenges to overcome for direct methanol fuel cells (DMFC) applications. In this work, superior poison-tolerant, carbon-free nanocoral structured platinum (ncs-Pt) catalysts are successfully synthesized using a micelle-directed method. The morphological and pore size of ncs-Pt are tailored by varying the compositional ratio of Pt in the precursor solutions and by changing the molecular ratios of different surfactant blocks. The physical properties of the ncs-Pt catalyst are observed through field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and X-ray diffraction (XRD), inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) whereas the electrochemical characteristics are analyzed through cyclic voltammetry (CV) and chronoamperometry. The developed ncs-Pt (5 mM) catalyst possesses high density of porous structures, high index facets, lower d-band center, and highly negative onset potential (-0.59V). Therefore, the developed ncs-Pt catalyst exhibits enhanced mass activity 6.56 mA/µg, and superior poison tolerance 5.62 for the methanol oxidation reaction.

#### **1. Introduction**

In recent decades, fuel cells, especially direct methanol fuel cells (DMFC), have attracted tremendous attention from research experts due to the worldwide oil and fossil fuel crises. The DMFC has captured an extremely large application area of our daily life, including use in transportation, stationary and portable power generation for industrial, residential and commercial factories in remote or urban areas. [1,2] Generally, the fuel cells produce electricity from chemical reactions with high efficiency with lower environmental pollution, and it can be stored and transported easily. However, the DMFC fabrication possesses critical challenges to provide membrane-electrode assembly and maintain high performance with lower loading of noble metals. [3,4]

In DMFC, the methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) is a pivotal process conducted by the electrocatalysts. The synthesis and the design of anode/cathode catalyst at enhanced efficiency are still challenging issues. [5] The noble metal (Ag/Au/Pt/Pd) nanoparticles are widely used as electrocatalysts due to their high-energy conversion capability. [3,7,8] Among those nanoparticles, Pt possesses enhanced catalytic activity for MOR both in alkaline and acidic media. [9] Although Pt has the highest catalytic activity among noble metal catalysts, the use of Pt was demotivated due to the easier poisoning caused by the carbonaceous products produced during the MOR. Furthermore, the noble metals catalyst dispersed on carbon supported materials normally degrades the performance due to the easy corrosion and aggregation of carbon materials. [10] Therefore, the main challenges are to substantially reduce the use of Pt particles with better electrochemical MOR performances. Moreover, CO-like poisoning effects can be tuned by lowering the d-

band.<sup>[11]</sup> The d-band center is the salient factor to control the surface metal characteristics. According to the density functional theory (DFT) analysis, the downshift of the d-band center decreases the binding strength of carbonaceous species due to the geometric and ligand effects. <sup>[12,13]</sup>

Currently, the crucial challenging issues for fuel cells are cost reduction, enhanced durability, and reduced poisoning effects of the catalyst. Concerning these issues, extensive research has been performed with fascinating heterometallic surface structures such as mono-, bi-, tri- and quaternary metallic structures, [14,15] nanodendrites, [10,16] nanowires-nanorods, [17] nanotubes, [3] hollow coral, hollow cube, nanoflower, [18] core-shell structures, [19,20] tetrahedral, [21] and carbon-supported metal nanoparticles. [22] However, the design of these fascinating structures normally involves one-pot synthesis, [12] pulse electrodeposition, [23] electrochemical deposition, [24] the polyol method, and the microwave heating method.<sup>[25]</sup> Generally, these synthesis methods have some complexity due to particle agglomeration, complex synthesis process and low dispersion, which consequently increases the use of precious metal complexes and reduction of the active surface area. On the other hand, electrochemical deposition with the micelle assembly technique in an aqueous surfactant solution results in extremely high dispersion of nanoparticles and the formation of various mesoporous structures.[26,27] These mesoporous structures provide enhanced active facets with uniform distribution. Although these catalysts show high catalytic activity for methanol and ethanol oxidation, they have very poor durability and poison tolerance. Therefore, superior poison tolerance, high durability, and enhanced catalytic activity of fuel cell catalysts are still challenging issues.

Here, we outline the synthesis of tunable platinum nanocoral structures for enhanced MOR with high poison tolerance. To the extent of our literature surveying, this is the first approach to synthesize successfully a promising and enhanced carbon-free electrocatalyst possessing superior poison-tolerant Pt nanocoral structures for MOR using well known a micelle-directed method. Furthermore, we will optimize the performance for different concentrations of Pt precursors as well as compared with the commercial platinum on graphitized carbon (Pt/C) catalyst. The morphological size of platinum nanocorals can easily be varied by controlling the precursor/surfactant concentration in the electrolyte. The platinum nanocoral structures can show enhanced catalytic activity and stability and superior poison tolerance properties for the MOR compared to the other reported bi- or tri-metallic structures and other metallic alloys. Therefore, the proposed strategy for synthesizing catalyst can be used as a promising method for the development of fuel cell catalysts.

#### **2. Results and discussion**

#### *2.1. Physical Characterization of ncs-Pts*

**Figure1** shows the FESEM analysis of the developed ncs-Pt catalyst. The coral-like structures of platinum nanoparticles are well formed using micelle directed process. During the electrochemical deposition, metal Pt species were reduced to the electrode with the surfactant micelles. These surfactant micelles can be self-assembled as coral templates for designing ncs-Pt catalyst.[28] The ncs-Pt pores provide a high surface area and allow high accessibility of electrochemical reactions. The average pore sizes of ncs-

Pts were calculated using open source ImageJ software. [29,30] They were 85.23 ± 2, 97.44 ± 4, and 81.35 ± 3 nm for 2.5, 5, and 7 mM samples, respectively. The 5 mM sample showed the highest pore size. Furthermore, we have optimized the synthesis process for ncs-Pt catalyst by tuning the electrolyte concentration during electrodeposition. It is observed that the density of ncs-Pts for 2.5 mM (Figure 1A) is lower than that of 5 mM (**Figure 1B)**, which implies the ncs-Pts were well distributed at 5 mM concentration. On the other hand, the ncs-Pts for 7 mM (**Figure 1C)** were agglomerated compared to those of 2.5 mM and 5 mM samples. Therefore, at 7 mM concentration, the ncs-Pts were agglomerated due to the higher concentration of electrolyte, which subsequently increased the particle loading on the substrate. **Figure 1D** shows the EDX spectra of the ncs-Pts (5 mM). The obtained atomic weight percentage of the ncs-Pt was approximately 93.45%, which consequently ensures the successful deposition of ncs-Pts on the electrode as well.

**Figure 1.** FESEM for ncs-Pts at different concentrations of deposition of Pt electrolyte: A) 2.5 mM, B) 5 mM, and C) 7 mM. D) EDX spectra of ncs-Pts (5 mM).

To study the crystalline structure, the developed catalysts were analyzed thorough XRD measurements (**Figure 2).** The XRD spectra showed six diffraction patterns for the ncs-Pt at 2Ɵ values of 39.39°, 46.46°, 54.23°, 56.21°, 64.77°, and 68.06°, which can correspond to (111), (200), (210), (211), (220), and (300), respectively (Pt-JCPDS card no. 97-064-9493). Those (111), (200), and (220) peaks are face centered cubic and consistent with the other reported works.[31] The ncs-Pt showed high-index facets (200), (210), (211), and (300) compared to other reported works.[10,16,32–35] This consequently leads to higher catalytic activity due to the presence of high-density atomic steps, ledges, and kinks. [36] Moreover, at 2Ɵ values of 38.35° and 44.46° two diffraction patterns

appeared which can be assigned to Au (111) and Au (200), respectively; which probably occurred due to the Au coated substrate. Furthermore, Pt (210) was absent in the 7 mM sample, which probably happened due to the agglomeration problem in the higher concentrations.

**Figure 2.** XRD spectra of ncs-Pts for different concentrations.

The developed electrocatalysts were further characterized using the surface-sensitive technique XPS (**Figure 3). Figure S1** shows the survey spectra of nCs-Pt. The highintensity peak of the C1s spectra is observed which probably indicates the existence of

residual surfactants on the electrode. The high-intensity 4f7/2 and 4f5/2 doublets of Pt<sup>0</sup> were observed at binding energies of 71.88 eV and 75.25 eV, respectively. Whereas the lowerintensity 4f7/2 and 4f5/2 doublets of Pt2+ peaks were appeared at binding energies of 72.57 eV and 75.90 eV, respectively. [37] Therefore, the XPS spectra shows the successful deposition of ncs-Pt using the developed method. Furthermore, compared to bulk Pt, the 4f7/2 and 4f5/2 doublets of ncs-Pt shifted 0.33 eV (7 mM), 0.88 eV (5 mM) and 0.53 eV (2.5 mM) towards higher binding energy (details of XPS is shown in **Figure S2**). This consequently indicates the downshift of the d-band center probably due to the ligand and geometric effect of ncs-Pts which consequently enhances the catalytic activity and increases the poison tolerance ratio. [38] Besides, the Pt<sup>0</sup> state provides more catalytic sites for the MOR than does Pt2+ . [12,39]

#### 2.2. Electrochemical Analysis

Initially, CVs (range -0.8 V to 0.8 V) of ncs-Pts with scan rate (S<sub>r</sub>) of 50 mVs<sup>-1</sup> were observed in N<sub>2</sub>-saturated 1 M KOH solution in the absence of methanol (**Figure 4**) to determine the electrochemical active surface area (ECSA). The oxidation/reduction peaks of ncs-Pts were found at -0.33 V, -0.19 V, -0.11 V, and -0.037 V for commercial Pt/C, 7 mM, 2.5 mM, and 5 mM, respectively. The positive shifting of reduction peak potentials compared to the commercial Pt/C catalyst indicates weakly bound of carbonaceous species, which consequently offers poison less active sites for MOR. The ECSA of ncs-Pts may vary in the hydrogen desorption/absorption region due to hydrogen may dissolve into ncs-Pts crystal lattice.<sup>[40]</sup> Therefore, the ECSA was calculated using the following formula:<sup>[41]</sup>

$$ECSA (m^2 g^{-1}Pt) = \frac{Q_{red}}{Q_{ref} \times Pt \ loading}$$
 (i)

Where Q<sub>red</sub> is the reduction charge measured in the reduction peak, Q<sub>ref</sub> is the reference charge 210 μC cm<sup>-2</sup>.<sup>[42]</sup> Pt loading information were confirmed thorough ICP-MS. The ECSA of ncs-Pts were calculated as 18.96 m<sup>2</sup> g<sub>Pt</sub><sup>-1</sup>, 63.80 m<sup>2</sup> g<sub>Pt</sub><sup>-1</sup>, 171.97 m<sup>2</sup> g<sub>Pt</sub><sup>-1</sup> and 127.81 m<sup>2</sup> g<sub>Pt</sub><sup>-1</sup> for commercial Pt/C, 7 mM, 5 mM, and 2.5 mM, respectively. The higher ECSA for ncs-Pts was obtained due to the unique structure of the fabricated ncs-Pts.

**Figure 4.** CVs of ncs-Pts at different concentrations, and commercial Pt/C in an N2 saturated 1 M KOH alkaline solution at 50 mVs-1 without methanol.

The electrochemical performances were observed through cyclic voltammetry (CV). The CV curves exhibited two peaks: one during the forward scan and another in the backward scan (**Figure 5A)**. During forward scan, MOR occurred according to the following reactions:[43]

Pt+CH3OH→Pt−CH3−OHads …………… (ii)

$$CH_3-OH_{ads} + H_2O \rightarrow CO_2 + 6H^+ + 6e^-$$
 (iii)

whereas, the backward oxidation peak indicates the further oxidation of carbonaceous species by the ncs-Pts surfaces to the CO2.[44]

$$Pt-CO_{ads} + H_2O \rightarrow Pt+2H^+ + 2e^- + CO_2 \dots (iv)$$

The onset potentials of ncs-Pts were found at -0.34 V, -0.59 V, and -0.40 V for 7 mM, 5 mM, and 2.5 mM, respectively. The presence of more mesoporous structures with highest average pore size leads to the lower onset potential for ncs-Pt deposited at 5 mM. Therefore, it possesses improved accessibility, mass transfer and efficient contact by the reactants.[45,46]

The MOR activity for ncs-Pts was observed using CV in the presence of 2 M methanol (**Figure 5A).** For all ncs-Pt structures and the commercial Pt/C, an anodic peak was formed due to the oxidation of methanol during the forward scan, and a cathodic peak was formed due to the oxidation of carbonaceous species formed during the forward scan. The synthesized ncs-Pt structure at 5mM shows the highest current density of 306.47 mA cm-2 compared to those at 2.5 mM and 7 mM under the same electrochemical environments. The electrochemical performance of the ncs-Pt at 7 mM is approximately 3 times lower than that of the ncs-Pt at 5 mM, which most likely occurred due to particle agglomeration. Furthermore, the onset potentials were observed as -0.34 V, -0.59 V, and -0.40 V (V vs. Ag/AgCl), for 7 mM, 5 mM, and 2.5 mM, respectively. Therefore, the more negative -0.59 V indicates that the ncs-Pt at 5 mM performs the higher MOR activities in the alkaline media.[47]

To validate this hypothesis, the developed catalysts were compared with commercial Pt/C (40 wt. %) catalysts. After testing the electrochemical performance in the same working environment, the developed ncs-Pt (5 mM) showed approximately 2 times more catalytic activity than that of commercial Pt/C. For this reason, the ncs-Pt at 5 mM was selected for further MOR experiments. Furthermore, to confirm the catalytic contribution of the Au substrate, a MOR experiment was observed at 2 M by using bare Au and bare Au /ncs-Pt electrodes (**Figure S3)**. From this experiment, the ncs-Pt modified electrode showed approximately 1000 times more catalytic activity than bare Au.

The ratio between forward and backward peak current indicates poison tolerance. [48] Therefore, the poison tolerability of ncs-Pt was analyzed from the forward and backward peak current ratio (**jf/jb**). These values were recorded (Table 1). According to Table 1, the developed ncs-Pt catalyst exhibits superior poison tolerance (**jf/j<sup>b</sup>** = 5.62) towards CO intermediates compared to the commercial Pt/C (**jf/j<sup>b</sup>** = 2.89) catalyst in the same environment. Therefore, the superior poison tolerance might be occurred due to two reasons i) presence of defect rich ncs-Pt surface which leads easy oxidation of CO species and ii) highly negative onset potential (-0.59 V) which suggests that easier removal of CO species. [49–53] Since the Pt-based catalysts are very sensitive to oxidize the carbonaceous species; therefore it also oxidizes the carbonaceous species effectively resulting in a higher poison tolerance ratio.[54]

In DMFC, the loading of precious metals is a crucial matter of concern. Material loading information was quantized through ICP-MS for ncs-Pt deposited at 2.5 mM, 5 mM, and 7 mM concentrations and observed as 1.57 µg, 3.07 µg, and 4.06 µg, respectively as noted in **Table 1**. Owing to the agglomeration of Pt, the maximum loading of Pt (4.03 µg) in the ncs-Pt deposited at 7 mM was found, which also supports the FESEM data (**Figure 2C).** Therefore, the mass and specific activity become significantly higher than commercial Pt/C (**Figure 5B** and **5C)**.

**Figure 5D** shows the scan rate variations from 25-150 mVs -1 using the cyclic voltammetry technique for ncs-Pt (5 mM) in a 1 M KOH solution. The current density increased with increasing scan rate, and the oxidation peak current shifted slightly towards the positive direction. From the calibration curve (**Figure 5E)**, a linear relationship was extracted from the I<sup>f</sup> and the square root of Sr. Hence, **Figure 5D and 5E** collectively suggest that the MOR catalyzed by ncs-Pt is a diffusion-controlled process. [55] Furthermore, the increase in the forward peak potential (Vf) and "ln" of the scan rate provides good linearity, which indicates that the MOR on ncs-Pt is an irreversible process (**Figure 5F)**. [56,57]

### *2.3. Tafel Plot and durability analysis*

The fast electron transfer kinetics of ncs-Pts and Pt/C were also analyzed a through wellknown Tafel plot (**Figure 6)** at lower potentials obtained from the cyclic voltammograms of **Figure 5A.** The lowest Tafel slope 258 mV dec-1 was obtained at 5 mM (**Table 2** and **Figure S4),** which also ensured that the Pt-5 mM possesses fast electron transfer capability due to quick transport of active species of MOR on the catalyst surfaces. [58] However, this Tafel slope observation also support the other experimental results.

**Figure 6.** Tafel slope of developed ncs-Pts and commercial Pt/C catalyst.

The durability of the ncs-Pts was tested using chronoamperometry at a constant optimized potential in the presence of 2 M methanol.[33,47] The measuring potentials for all ncs-pt were optimized by testing chronoamperometry for 80 s at different potentials (**Figure S5).** At 0.2 V, the ncs-Pt showed maximum current. The rapid decrease in the oxidation current density may indicate the formation of carbonaceous species on the ncs-Pt surfaces. The ncs-Pt deposited at 5 mM exhibits the higher electrocatalytic activity of up to 10000 s, and the obtained minimum current density at 10000 s is 10.94 mA cm-2 , whereas for Pt/C it showed 9.27 mA cm-2 as shown in **Figure 7A** and **7B**. The unusual degradation of current for 7mM probably occurred due to the N2/CO gas bubbled at 2535 s position and after that the current drastically reduced. [59]

**Figure 7.** The durability of ncs-Pt for 2 M methanol in N2-saturated 1 M KOH for up to A) 10000 s and B) close view from 8000-10000 s.

Finally, the electrochemical performance of ncs-Pts towards the MOR was compared with the results in recently reported works (**Table 2)**. Based on the comparison, we believe that the developed strategy would be the promising one against existing methods to yield high catalytic activity as well as superior poison tolerance for the DMFC. Therefore, it can figure out that the developed method would be the best candidate for developing fuel cell catalysts in industry.

### **3. Conclusion**

In summary, we have successfully synthesized ncs-Pt possessing a high density of highindex active sites with enhanced intermetallic phases for accelerating the chemical reactions, mass transfer and maximum usages of active surfaces in the pore area. Among three samples, the ncs-Pt deposited at 5 mM concentration exhibited enhanced mass activity 6.56 mA/µg for the MOR in the alkaline media with superior poison durability due to the specialized nanostructure with the lowest d-band center. Furthermore, it also

showed more durability than the commercial Pt/C catalyst. Therefore, from the physical characterization and electrochemical analysis of ncs-Pt catalysts, we believe that it can be a promising method to develop low-cost, high-efficiency and high-durability DMFC catalysts, or even other fuel cell catalysts.

#### **4. Experimental section**

#### **4.1. Materials**

Polystyrene-b-poly(oxyethylene) (PS18000-b-PEO7500, PS-b-PEO) purchased from Polymer Source, Inc., Potassium tetrachloroplatinate (II) (K2PtCl4, 98%), Potassium hydroxide (ASSAY(KOH) min. 85.0%(m/m)), Tetrahydrofuran (THF, anhydrous ≥99.9%), Sodium chloride (BioUltra, for molecular biology, ≥99.5% (AT)), Platinum on graphitized carbon (Pt/C) (40 wt. % loading), Methanol (ACS reagent, 37 wt. % in H2O, contains 10- 15% Methanol), and Ethanol (anhydrous, ≥99.5%) were purchased from Aldrich Co. (St. Louis, USA). All reagents are used without further purifications.

#### **4.2. Electrode Preparation**

The working electrode was prepared using Au and Ti coated (150 and 30 nm thickness, respectively) Si/SiO2 substrate by the sputtering process. Then the working electrode area of (2×3.75) mm<sup>2</sup> was obtained by the photolithography process. After rigorous cleaning by distilled water (DI) and drying under N2 flow the electrode was used for ncs-Pt electrodeposition. The commercial Ag/AgCl electrode used as a reference electrode and (4×6 mm) <sup>2</sup>Pt used as a counter electrode. All electrical connections were made by soldering using commonly used Sn-Pb (60/40) wire.

### **4.3. Physical Characterization**

The samples for physical characterization were prepared on the Au/Ti (150 nm/30 nm) coated Si/SiO2 substrate. The FE-SEM and EDX were carried out using JSM-7900F analyzer. The pore sizes were analyzed using ImageJ software. [29,30] The ICP-MS analyses were carried out using J200 LA (Applied Spectra Inc.'s). The XPS characterization was analyzed by using Maker: PHI 5000 VersaProbe (Ulvac-PHI)

WILEY-VCH

analyzer at a background pressure of 2.0×10-7 Pa, Monochromator Al Ka(1486.6 eV), Anode (25 W, 15 kV), Adventitious C1s peak (284.6 eV). The XRD characterizations were carried out by an ATX-G diffractometer using Cu anode with a goniometer radius of 300 mm, and a maximum power of 18 kW (60 kV, 300 mA).

#### 4.4. Electrochemical Measurements

The electrochemical MOR was measured in N<sub>2</sub> saturated 1 M KOH aqueous solution in presence of 2 M methanol using CV. Whereas the durability test was measured for 10000 s at corresponding optimized peak potentials using chronoamperometry technique in ambient conditions by using the CHI 660D electrochemical workstation.

#### 4.5. Synthesis of ncs-Pts

The synthesis process diagram is shown in scheme 1. In a typical electrochemical synthesis of Pt nanocoral structures, 5 mg of PS-b-PEO powder was dissolved in 750 µL of THF solvent at 40 °C, later on, 750 µL of ethanol was added to the solution. Then, 4 µL of 5 mM K<sub>2</sub>PtCl<sub>6</sub> solution was pipetted gently into the clear PS-b-PEO surfactant solution, and consequently, spherical micelles were formed in the presence of water with PtCl<sub>6</sub><sup>2-</sup>. The mixed solution was stirred gently for 0.5 h at 40 °C to organize the dissolved Pt species along the periphery of the PEO region of the spherical micelles. The formation of micelles were confirmed through Wills-Tyndal phenomena (**Figure S6**). [67] Finally, a light brown color was observed, and this solution was used for amperometric electrodeposition for 1500 s at - 0.15 V, 0.5 s sample interval on Au/Ti sputtered Si/SiO<sub>2</sub> electrode. After electrodeposition, the electrode was rigorously washed with DI water, followed by calcination at 250 °C for 2 h in air environment.

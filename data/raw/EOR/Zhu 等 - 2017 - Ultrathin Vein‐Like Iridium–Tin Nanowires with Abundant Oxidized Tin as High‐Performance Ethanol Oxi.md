Iridium (Ir) holds great promise for ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR), while its practical applications suffer from the limited shape-controlled synthesis due to its lowenergy barrier for nucleation. To overcome this limitation, the preparation of a new class of ultrathin vein-like Ir–tin nanowires (Ir–Sn NWs) with abundant oxidized Sn is reported. By tuning the ratio of Ir to Sn, the optimized  $Ir_{67}Sn_{33}/C$  exhibits the highest mass density of 95.6 mA  $mg^{-1}$  Ir for EOR at low potential (0.04 V), which is 4.1-fold and 20-fold higher than that of Ir/C and the commercial Pt/C, respectively. It also exhibits the smallest Tafel slope of 153 mV dec<sup>-1</sup> and superior stability after 2 h chronoamperometric measurement. Electrochemical measurements and X-ray photoelectron spectra results confirm that the abundant oxidized Sn promotes a complete oxidization of ethanol into  $CO_2$  at low potential. This work highlights the importance of non-noble metal on enhancing the EOR performance.

Ethanol (CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>OH) is an ideal energy source for fuel cells because of its unique characteristics such as high availability from biomass production, low toxicity, and safety for storage and transportation in liquid form.<sup>[1-6]</sup> However, ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) in fuel cells is extremely hindered by the contemporary, low-efficient catalysts. To overcome these limitations, noble metal nanomaterials have been extensively

studied as the highly efficient catalysts toward EOR,<sup>[7-12]</sup> especially the Pt-based catalysts, which is commonly considered as the optimal catalyst. However, during the complex EOR process, the generated intermediates such as CO can poison Pt active sites on the surface, largely restricted its efficiency. Hence, developing the Pt-free catalysts for EOR is highly desirable. While various shape-controlled noble metal-based catalysts have been well testified as highly active and selective ones for EOR,<sup>[10,13-15]</sup> the iridium (Ir)-based electrocatalysts for EOR have rarely been reported, despite their appealing catalytic activities in many electrochemical catalysis.<sup>[16-21]</sup>

The practical applications of Ir nanomaterials suffer from not only their scarcity and high cost but also difficulties in controlled synthesis, in which only small and irregular Ir nanoparticles (NPs) can be obtained. To address the above challenges, introducing non-noble metal into Ir is highly desirable. Except for reducing the cost, experimental results suggest that introducing the non-noble metal promotes the formation of shape-controlled nanomaterials, which may provide an alternative pathway for the controlled synthesis. Furthermore, a complete  $\rm C_2H_5OH$  oxidation undergoes a 12-electron process to generate  $\rm CO_2$  and water, while most of the real EOR processes only produce acetaldehyde or acetic acid via two or four electrons process

since the multiple poison intermediates such CO and CH*<sup>x</sup>* can poison the surface active sites and slow down the reaction kinetics.[30] The introduction of the oxidized non-noble metal into noble metal catalysts is expected to boost the EOR process,[13,30] since oxidized metals favor the development of OH species from dissociative adsorption of water, which not only helps to clean the surface of noble metal catalyst by removing CO and CH*x* but also enhances the reaction kinetics and CC bond splitting ability.[30] Therefore, it is highly desirable to design Ir nanomaterials with oxidized metals for enhanced EOR catalysis.

Herein, ultrathin vein-like Ir–tin nanowires (IrSn NWs) with controlled compositions were synthesized by a facile wet-chemical method, where Sn plays a critical role in the formation of ultrathin vein-like structure. The ultrathin veinlike Ir-Sn NWs with different Ir/Sn ratios provide an ideal platform to pursue the best catalytic condition toward EOR, in which the Ir67Sn33/C exhibited the highest mass activity, lowest Tafel slope, and best durability for EOR, compared to the Ir/C and other IrSn/C with different Ir/Sn molar ratios. Significantly, Sn in IrSn NWs is in the form of oxidized Sn, which is beneficial for promoting C2H5OH oxidation. The electrochemical activities of IrSn/C improve with increasing the concentration of oxidized Sn. It turns out that the optimized Ir67Sn33/C enabled oxidization of C2H5OH into CO2 efficiently at low potential, which is 20 times higher in mass activity than the commercial Pt/C at 0.04 V. The successful introduction of abundant oxidized Sn can boost the synthesis and electrocatalysis of Ir-based nanomaterials, which paves a new avenue for the fabrication of the high-performance electrocatalysts with unique nanostructure for practical fuel cells and beyond.

The synthesis of IrSn NWs was carried out by using iridium(III) chloride hydrate (IrCl3) as Ir precursor, tin(II) acetate (Sn(Ac)2) as Sn precursor, citric acid (CA) as reducing agent, poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP) as reducing agent, and ethylene glycol (EG) as solvent and reducing agent (see the Experimental Section for details). Through optimizing a variety of synthetic parameters, such as solvents, amount of reducing agent, and reaction time, we found that the combined usages of CA, PVP, Sn(Ac)2, and EG were essential for the successful preparation of vein-like NWs (Figures S1–S4, Supporting Information). The typical high-angle annular dark field STEM (HAADF-STEM) (**Figure 1**a) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Figure 1b) images clearly show the ultrathin vein-like morphology with many kinks, which were interwoven by ultrathin NWs. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of the products in the inset of Figure 1a can be indexed to (111), (220), and (311) facecentered cubic (*fcc*) Ir (JCPDS No. 06-0598) with no diffraction ring of Sn species can be found, indicating the formation of crystalline Ir and absence of crystalline Sn. Since the molar ratio of Ir to Sn in the NWs was determined to be 67:33 by scanning electron microscopy energy-dispersive spectrometer (SEM-EDS) (Figure 1c), the product was termed as Ir67Sn33 NWs. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern was used to verify the crystalline nature of vein-like Ir67Sn33 NWs (Figure 1d). The broad peaks of (111), (220), and (311) planes of *fcc* Ir give the evidence of the ultrathin feature of the NWs. No distinct peak shift was observed compared to that of the (111) plane of pure Ir (2<sup>θ</sup> = 40.6°) (JCPDS No. 06-0598) and no Sn (JCPDS No. 05-0390) peaks were found in the veinlike Ir67Sn33 NWs, indicating the nonalloy phase of Ir67Sn33 NWs that coincided with the result of SAED. The crystalline nature of the vein-like Ir67Sn33 NWs was further characterized by high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) (Figure 1e). A majority of the interplanar spacings of ≈0.230 nm were observed, which were consistent with the (111) plane of *fcc* Ir (JCPDS No. 06-0598). As shown in the inset of Figure 1e, it is obvious that a few exterior low coordination atoms and defects adhere to the kinks, which can supply a number of active sites for catalytic process.[31–34] In addition, we have carefully collected the fast Fourier transform (FFT) patterns in three different regions from HRTEM images (Figure S5, Supporting Information). The diffraction direction showed an obvious shift that attributed to the discontinuous crystalline fringes in the NWs, revealing the polycrystalline structure of the vein-like NWs. STEM-EDS elemental mapping analysis showed the composition distribution of vein-like Ir67Sn33 NWs (Figure 1f), where both Ir and Sn were uniformly distributed over the whole vein-like NWs. In short, the above characterizations confirm that the Ir67Sn33 NWs are composed of a nonalloy bimetallic nanostructure with the crystalline Ir and the amorphous Sn species.[35]

Interestingly, introducing the non-noble metal Sn into Ir is necessary for the formation of the ultrathin vein-like Ir67Sn33 NWs since only pure Ir NPs could be synthesized in the absence of Sn precursor while keeping the other parameters same (Figure S3, Supporting Information). After acknowledging the important role of non-noble metal Sn in the synthesis for ultrathin vein-like Ir67Sn33 NWs, we further studied the effect of the amount of Sn(Ac)2 on the synthesis of Ir67Sn33 NWs. Figures S6–S8 (Supporting Information) show the compositional, morphological, and structural characterizations of the three prepared IrSn NWs with different molar ratios (Ir72Sn28, Ir67Sn33, and Ir61Sn39) in details, respectively. The SEM-EDS results consist of the supplied molar ratios of Ir72Sn28, Ir67Sn33, and Ir61Sn39, respectively (Figure S6, Supporting Information). The TEM images show that Ir72Sn28 NWs and Ir61Sn39 NWs have the similar ultrathin vein-like morphology as Ir67Sn33 NWs (Figure S7, Supporting Information). The XRD patterns of Ir72Sn28 NWs and Ir61Sn39 NWs are similar to that of Ir67Sn33 NWs (Figure S8a, Supporting Information), where one set of peaks fit well with that of *fcc* Ir and no Sn peaks are observed, indicating these IrSn NWs have nonalloy binary structure.

We then started to elucidate the growth mechanism of Ir67Sn33 NWs by collecting the TEM images (**Figure 2**) and SEM-EDS spectra (Figure S9, Supporting Information) of the intermediates at different reaction time. As shown in Figure 2a,b of the intermediates obtained after the 1 h synthesis, only small NPs with the diameter of less than 2 nm were obtained. The atomic ratio of Ir in this intermediate was 75.70%. As the reaction prolonged to 3 h, the size of IrSn NPs almost kept the same and a small proportion of short NWs appeared (Figure 2c,d). When the reaction time increased to 5 h, the distinct vein-like NWs came out (Figure 2e,f). At this point, a large number of convex/concave regions and kinks could

be observed. Further extension of reaction time to 10 h, the ultrathin vein-like NWs were finally obtained with the atomic ratio of Ir to Sn of 67.08:32.92 (Figure 2g,h). These time-dependent morphological changes suggest an attached process of the formation of vein-like NWs, where it started from the initial small nanoparticles, then gradually grew into short NWs and finally lead to the ultrathin vein-like NWs (Figure 2i). The XRD patterns of IrSn intermediates showed that all the peaks matched well with those of *fcc* Ir (JCPDS No. 06-0598), indicating the intermediates have the same nonalloy crystalline phase as Ir67Sn33 NWs (Figure S10, Supporting Information).

The unique structures of the as-prepared Ir67Sn33 NWs, such as ultrathin feature, plenty of defects and steps, exposed large active surface area, and numerous active sites, are beneficial to the oxidation of C2H5OH molecules.[31] To this end, we chose the Ir67Sn33 NWs as electrocatalysts for EOR. The electrocatalysts were prepared by a surface-clean method that directly grown IrSn NWs on carbon black without using any surfactants (Figure S11, Supporting Information). The resultant electrocatalysts were dispersed in C2H5OH with 5% Nafion to form a uniform catalyst ink via 30 min sonication. 4 µL of catalyst ink was casted on the glassy carbon electrode (GCE) (containing 20.4 µgIr cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> according to the thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) (Figure S12, Supporting Information) and SEM-EDS (Figure S13, Supporting Information)).

The EOR activities of the pristine IrSn/C were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) (Figure S14, Supporting Information). Although mass current density of Ir67Sn33/C was

slightly higher than other Ir-Sn/C, the three Ir-Sn/C exhibited low mass current density. Therefore, we thermally treated the  $Ir_{67}Sn_{33}/C$  at 200, 250, and 300 °C under  $H_2/N_2$ flow for 1 h to optimize the catalytic activities (Figure S15, Supporting Information). Among the Ir<sub>67</sub>Sn<sub>33</sub>/C(H<sub>2</sub>-200 °C),  $Ir_{67}Sn_{33}/C(H_2-250 \text{ °C})$ , and  $Ir_{67}Sn_{33}/C(H_2-300 \text{ °C})$ , the Ir<sub>67</sub>Sn<sub>33</sub>/C(H<sub>2</sub>-250 °C) displayed the highest mass current density of 94.5 mA mg<sub>lr</sub><sup>-1</sup> at 0.09 V. Catalytic durability was then tested at the low potential of 0.09 V by chronoamperometry. Figure 3a shows the concrete mass current densities of the catalysts in the durability measurements at 0.09 V for 2 h. Initially, the  $Ir_{67}Sn_{33}/C(H_2-200 \text{ °C})$ ,  $Ir_{67}Sn_{33}/C(H_2-250 \text{ °C})$ , and Ir<sub>67</sub>Sn<sub>33</sub>/C(H<sub>2</sub>-300 °C) electrocatalysts display the mass current densities of 42.28, 82.65, and 25.20 mA mg<sub>lr</sub><sup>-1</sup>, respectively. After 1 h, mass current densities of Ir<sub>67</sub>Sn<sub>33</sub>/C(H<sub>2</sub>-200 °C),  $Ir_{67}Sn_{33}/C(H_2-250 \text{ °C})$ , and  $Ir_{67}Sn_{33}/C(H_2-300 \text{ °C})$  decrease to 4.33, 6.11, and 2.02 mA mg<sub>Ir</sub>, respectively, and then slowly drop to 2.86, 3.32, and 0.98 mA  $mg_{tr}^{-1}$  until 2 h. It is obvious that thermal treatment at 250 °C can optimize the catalytic activities of Ir<sub>67</sub>Sn<sub>33</sub>/C. We then started to explore the influence of composition on Ir-Sn/C in EOR. Detailed electrochemical results are represented in Figure 3b-d. As shown in Figure 3b, the mass current densities of Ir<sub>72</sub>Sn<sub>28</sub>/C, Ir<sub>67</sub>Sn<sub>33</sub>/C,  $Ir_{61}Sn_{39}/C$ , and Ir/C are 59.9, 95.6, 44.1, and 23.6 mA  $mg_{lr}^{-1}$  at 0.04 V, respectively. The  $Ir_{67}Sn_{33}/C$  exhibits the highest mass

activity among the four different catalysts, which is 1.6, 2.2, and 4.1 times higher than those of Ir<sub>72</sub>Sn<sub>28</sub>/C, Ir<sub>61</sub>Sn<sub>39</sub>/C, and Ir/C, respectively. Meanwhile, all the Ir-Sn/C catalysts show similar oxidation peaks at low potential, which are much higher than that of the Ir/C, indicating that the Ir-Sn/C catalysts own better EOR activity than Ir/C. Figure 3c shows the Tafel plots of the  $Ir_{72}Sn_{28}/C$ ,  $Ir_{67}Sn_{33}/C$ ,  $Ir_{61}Sn_{39}/C$ , and Ir/C. The Ir<sub>67</sub>Sn<sub>33</sub>/C exhibits the lowest Tafel slope (153 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>) among the four catalysts, indicating the highest rate of C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OH electrooxidation. By comparing the CV curves and Tafel plots of  $Ir_{72}Sn_{28}/C$ ,  $Ir_{67}Sn_{33}/C$ ,  $Ir_{61}Sn_{39}/C$ , and Ir/C, we find that the Ir<sub>67</sub>Sn<sub>33</sub>/C exhibits the best activity toward EOR. Obviously, all the Ir-Sn/C show higher mass activity and reaction rate than Ir/C, suggesting the non-noble metal Sn may assist the EOR. In addition, the durabilities of the Ir<sub>72</sub>Sn<sub>28</sub>/C, Ir<sub>67</sub>Sn<sub>33</sub>/C, Ir<sub>61</sub>Sn<sub>30</sub>/C, and Ir/C were also examined by applying a constant potential at 0.09 V for 2 h. As displayed in Figure 3d, the Ir<sub>67</sub>Sn<sub>33</sub>/C shows the best durability, and all Ir-Sn/C catalysts present better durability than the Ir/C. After the durability measurements, limited changes in morphology and composition were found in Ir<sub>67</sub>Sn<sub>33</sub>/C (Figures S16 and S13d, Supporting Information), while plenty of aggregations were observed in the Ir/C (Figure S17, Supporting Information), further highlighting the superior durability of the  $Ir_{67}Sn_{33}/C$ .

Since Sn plays a significant role in the enhanced EOR catalysis, we analyzed the chemical states of Ir and Sn of different Ir-Sn/C after thermal treatment at 250 °C under H<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub> flow by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). As shown in Figure 4, the surface atomic ratios of Ir/Sn in Ir<sub>72</sub>Sn<sub>28</sub>/C, Ir<sub>67</sub>Sn<sub>33</sub>/C, and Ir<sub>61</sub>Sn<sub>39</sub>/C are 55.85/44.15, 50.52/49.48, and 48.92/51.08, respectively. Furthermore, the XPS peaks of Ir in different catalysts were divided into Ir 4f<sub>7/2</sub> and Ir 4f<sub>5/2</sub> peaks, which can be further splitted into two doublets, corresponding to Ir (0) (purple line) and Ir (IV) (orange line) (Figure 4a). It was calculated that the Ir (0) fraction in Ir/C (55.01%) is slightly higher than those in  $Ir_{72}Sn_{28}/C$  (43.56%),  $Ir_{67}Sn_{33}/C$  (43.18%), and  $Ir_{61}Sn_{39}/C$ (40.83%) (Table S1, Supporting Information). As shown in Figure 4b, the Sn 3d peaks of Ir<sub>72</sub>Sn<sub>28</sub>/C, Ir<sub>67</sub>Sn<sub>33</sub>/C, and Ir<sub>61</sub>Sn<sub>39</sub>/C are composed of Sn 3d<sub>5/2</sub> and Sn 3d<sub>3/2</sub> peaks, both of which are split into two oxidized Sn peaks and one metallic Sn peak. The oxidized Sn mainly involves Sn(II) (orange line) and Sn(IV) (pink line). The metallic Sn (purple line) peaks are located at Sn(0) 3d<sub>5/2</sub> 484.9 eV and Sn(0) 3d<sub>3/2</sub> 493.3 eV.<sup>[36]</sup> For all Ir-Sn/C, the peaks of Sn(II) and Sn(IV) are much higher than that of Sn(0), and the oxidized Sn accounts for over 98% (Table S2, Supporting Information), indicating that abundant oxidized Sn on the surface of Ir-Sn/C. Among these three Ir-Sn/C, Ir<sub>67</sub>Sn<sub>33</sub>/C has the highest content of oxidized Sn, and the content of oxidized Sn in Ir<sub>72</sub>Sn<sub>28</sub>/C is slightly higher than that in Ir<sub>61</sub>Sn<sub>39</sub>/C. With increasing the content of oxidized Sn, electrochemical mass activity and durability improve in three Ir-Sn/C, in which the Ir<sub>67</sub>Sn<sub>33</sub>/C with the highest amount of oxidized Sn shows the best electrochemical performance. More significantly, the activities of all the three Ir-Sn/C are higher than that of the Ir/C. Therefore, the oxidized Sn can promote the electrochemical activity of EOR for Ir-based binary metal catalysts since oxidized Sn is propitious for the formation of OH species and helps to remove the adsorbed poison CO or CH<sub>r</sub> intermediates, which efficiently promote the complete oxidization of C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OH into CO<sub>2</sub>.[30] Considering the low EOR activity of the pristine Ir-Sn/C, the surface states of the Ir-Sn/C before thermal treatment were further studied by XPS (Figure S18, Supporting Information). Although the surface atomic ratios of Ir/Sn in Ir-Sn/C have no obvious changes after the thermal treatment, the surface oxidized Ir distinctly decreased while oxidized Sn had slightly changed (Tables S1-S4, Supporting Information). Therefore, the EOR activities of Ir-Sn/C have distinctly increased after thermal treatment, which can be attributed to the reduction of surface-oxidized Ir that consequently increased ethanol adsorption.<sup>[17]</sup>

EOR has been confirmed as an intricate reaction, because it involves multiple reaction products, including  $CO_2$ ,  $CH_3CHO$ , and  $CH_3COOH$ . Two parallel reactions can be used to interpret the reaction process of EOR in acidic solution: [23]

$$CH_3CH_2OH \rightarrow [CH_3CH_2OH]_{ad} \rightarrow CH_3CHO$$

$$\rightarrow CH_3 + CO \rightarrow 2CO_2 \text{ (complete oxidation)}$$
(1)

$$CH_3CH_2OH \rightarrow [CH_3CH_2OH]_{ad} \rightarrow CH_3CHO$$

$$\rightarrow CH_3CO \rightarrow CH_3COOH(partial oxidation)$$

During EOR, a complete oxidation into CO2 is more difficult than the partial oxidation into CH3CHO or CH3COOH,[17] because forming CO2 involves a 12-electron transfer via CC bond cleavage, while producing CH3CHO or CH3COOH only needs two or four-electron transfer.[38] In other words, more energy is needed to split CC bond in order to generate CO2 in the complete oxidation.[30] Therefore, exploring an excellent electrocatalyst for the complete oxidation is necessary, which could greatly improve the utilization of C2H5OH.

To elucidate the EOR mechanism of Ir67Sn33/C, we further investigate possible intermediates of EOR for Ir67Sn33/C, Ir/C, and Pt/C. First, Ir67Sn33/C, Ir/C, and Pt/C were activated for 300 cycles at 30 mV s<sup>−</sup>1 in 0.5 m H2SO4 solution (Figure S19, Supporting Information) before carrying out the electrochemical tests in a mixture of 0.5 m C2H5OH, 0.5 m CH3CHO, or 0.5 m CH3COOH with 0.5 m H2SO4 at the rate of 30 mV s<sup>−</sup>1 from −0.1 to 0.35 V, respectively (**Figure 5**). Only the Ir67Sn33/C has a high oxidation peak at potential less than 0.1 V, with the excellent

mass current density of 95.6 mA <sup>−</sup> mgIr 1 at 0.04 V, which is 4 and 20 times higher than Ir/C (23.5 mA mg<sup>−</sup>1) and Pt/C (4.9 mA mg<sup>−</sup>1), respectively (Figure 5a). The durabilities of the Ir67Sn33/C, Ir/C, and Pt/C were also conducted at a constant potential of 0.09 V for 2 h, in which the Ir67Sn33/C exhibited superior durability while Ir/C was nearly inactive after 1 h, and Pt/C lost activity completely in a very short time (Figure S20, Supporting Information). As shown in Figures S17 and S21 (Supporting Information), obvious aggregations were found in Ir/C and Pt/C, while the Ir67Sn33/C had relatively few aggregations, further suggesting that the Ir67Sn33/C is more stable than Ir/C and Pt/C. In addition, the similar catalytic curves as the measured EOR curves were observed in CH3CHO oxidation reaction (Figure 5b), where only the Ir67Sn33/C had an obvious oxidation peak from −0.1 to 0.1 V, suggesting that the Ir67Sn33/C shows the best electrochemical activity among the three electrocatalysts at low potential. These phenomena show that CH3CHO is a necessary intermediate product of EOR, similar to the reported measurement.[23] The CH3COOH oxidation reaction was further carried out to check if CH3COOH is the ultimate product of EOR (Figure 5c). Although Ir67Sn33/C had slightly higher mass activity than Ir/C and Pt/C, all the three electrocatalysts show negligible mass activity compared with those in EOR and CH3CHO oxidation reaction, indicating that CH3COOH is the ultimate product of partial oxidation for EOR. Since a complete oxidation of ethanol into CO2 involves a 12-electron transfer while partial oxidation into CH3COOH involves a four-electron transfer as mentioned above two parallel reactions;[38] higher mass activities in both CH3CH2OH and CH3CHO oxidations of the Ir67Sn33/C than those of the Ir/C and Pt/C indicate that CO2 can be the major ultimate product of Ir67Sn33/C for EOR. In a word, by comparing CH3CH2OH, CH3CHO, and CH3COOH oxidation processes, we find that the abundant oxidized Sn in Ir67Sn33/C could promote the complete oxidation of CH3CH2OH molecules into CO2 rather than CH3CHO or CH3COOH, which significantly enhances the EOR performance of Ir67Sn33/C.

In summary, the synthesis of a new class of ultrathin veinlike Ir67Sn33 NWs is successfully demonstrated with abundant oxidized Sn as high-performance EOR electrocatalysts for C2H5OH electrooxidation. By upgrading the synthetic method and tuning the amount of Sn precursors supplied, a clean surface is readily obtained, vein-like IrSn NWs with different Ir/Sn ratios. Interestingly, the abundant oxidized Sn is found distributed uniformly in those unique IrSn NWs, which plays an important role on enhancing the EOR process. The electrochemical performances of IrSn/C improve with increasing the content of the oxidized Sn. The optimized Ir67Sn33/C can oxidize C2H5OH into CO2 efficiently at low potential with the mass activity being 20 times higher than that of Pt/C at 0.04 V, as well as enhance the durability. This work highlights the important role of oxidized Sn in synthesis and electrocatalysis of Ir-based nanomaterials, presenting a promising candidate as efficient electrocatalyst for EOR.

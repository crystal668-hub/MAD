### Abstract

Dealloying by which the transition metal is partially or completely leached from an alloy precursor is an effective way to optimize the fundamental effects for further enhancing the electrocatalysis of a catalyst. Herein, to address the deficiencies associated with the commonly used dealloying methods, for example, electrochemical and sulfuric acid/nitric acid treatment, we report an acetic acid‐assisted mild strategy to dealloy Cu atoms from the outer surface layers of CuPd alloy nanoparticles to achieve high‐efficiency electrocatalysis for oxygen reduction and ethanol oxidation in an alkaline electrolyte. The leaching of Cu atoms by acetic acid exerts an additional compressive strain effect on the surface layers and exposes more active Pd atoms, which is beneficial for boosting the catalytic performance of a dealloyed catalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR). In particular, for ORR, the CuPd nanoparticles with a Pd/Cu molar ratio of 2:1 after acetic dealloying show a half‐wave potential of 0.912 V (vs. RHE) and a mass activity of 0.213 A mgPd<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> at 0.9 V, respectively, while for EOR, the same dealloyed sample has a mass activity and a specific activity of 8.4 A mg−<sup>1</sup> and 8.23 mA cm−<sup>2</sup> , respectively, much better than their dealloyed counterparts at other temperatures and commercial Pd/C as well as a Pt/C catalyst.

### <span id="page-1-0"></span>1 | INTRODUCTION

Alloving a noble metal with a transition metal in the first row of the element periodic table that has smaller lattice constants, e.g., Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Pb, is an effective way to make use of the geometric and ligand effects for enhancing electrocatalysis in a given electrochemical reaction, such as the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) or the methanol/ethanol oxidation reaction (MOR/ EOR).<sup>1-16</sup> The former refers to the lateral strain effect that is induced by different atomic arrangements of surface atoms, while the latter is caused by the atomic vicinity of two dissimilar surface metal atoms that leads to charge transfer or shift between the atoms. Both of them could boost the catalytic performance of the active metal by affecting its electronic band structure. 17-20 Unfortunately, in alloy nanoparticles, the transitionmetal atoms would inevitably dilute the surface-active sites of the noble metal, causing an ensemble effect (distribution of heteroatoms on the active sites) that might adversely affect the catalytic performance of the same. Accordingly, a dealloying strategy, by which the transition metal is partially or completely leached from an alloy precursor, has been developed to optimize the fundamental effects (e.g., geometric, ligand, and ensemble effect) for further enhancing the electrocatalytic activity of a catalyst. 21-29

After the dealloying process, the surface layers of the alloy precursor become rich in noble metal atoms. For the alloys with high noble/transition-metal ratios, we may hypothesize that the phase structure of the alloy particles could be maintained after leaching the transition metal. Then, in theory, the dealloying is equivalent to replacing the original transition-metal atoms with atoms that have a zero radius or producing a number of vacancy defects. In this sense, a shrinkage phenomenon to the vacancies would occur for reaching a new equilibrium in the alloys, which naturally induces a contraction in lattice constants (as compared with the normal lattice constants). Of course, the surface layer of the alloy precursor may undergo reconstruction after leaching of the transition-metal atoms, as reported by Yu et al. in a recent study, 30 where they found that an electrochemical post-treatment reproduces a highly crystalline Pd-skin structure on a PdCu alloy nanotube. Even in the latter case, the lattice mismatch between the noble metal skin (or shell) and the alloy core with smaller lattice constants would also lead to compression in the thin skin. In both cases, the lattice contraction leads to the decrease in the distance of noble metal atoms and therefore increases the overlap of their d orbitals. Consequently, the band broadens, and the center of their d-band moves to lower energy to maintain the same degree of filling. As postulated by Nørskov and coworkers for the *d*-band theory,  $^{31-34}$  the lower

*d*-band center means that more anti-bonding states are pulled below the Fermi level, which weakens the adsorption of oxygenated intermediates, for example, O and OH in the oxygen reduction process and CO in the alcohol oxidation process on the noble metal sites, <sup>9,10,35–37</sup> which promotes the reaction kinetics and enhances their intrinsic electrocatalysis.

In this context, instead of the commonly used electrochemical method, <sup>21–30</sup> which is time-consuming and also not suitable for large-scale preparation, and sulfuric acid or nitric acid treatment, 38-41 which often induces aggregation of the nanoparticles, we report a mild strategy that is based on acetic acid leaching for dealloying CuPd alloy nanoparticles to achieve high-efficiency electrocatalysis in the ORR and the EOR under alkaline conditions. Specifically, for ORR, the half-wave potential and the mass activity of CuPd nanoalloys after acetic dealloying at an appropriate temperature are  $0.912\,\mathrm{V}$  (vs. RHE) and  $0.213\,\mathrm{A\,mg_{Pd}}^{-1}$  at  $0.9\,\mathrm{V}$ , respectively, while for EOR, the mass activity and specific activity of the dealloyed CuPd nanoparticles are 8.4 A mg<sup>-1</sup> and 8.23 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, respectively. The higher activity of dealloyed CuPd nanoparticles might be due to the lattice compression in Pdenriched surface layers and the exposure of more active Pd atoms. The former weakens the adsorption of oxygenated intermediates generated during ORR and EOR, while the latter leads to an increase in the electrochemically active surface areas (ECSAs) available for electrochemical reactions.

### 2 | RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

# 2.1 | Synthesis of alloyed and dealloyed CuPd nanoparticles

The synthesis of fine CuPd alloy nanoparticles by the galvanic replacement reaction (GRR) has been documented in our previous studies. <sup>42–44</sup> In brief, the Pd<sup>2+</sup> cations are reduced by the preformed Cu seeds in the oleylamine/oleic acid mixture based on GRR between the two, which couples with the subsequent reduction of generated Cu<sup>2+</sup> cations by oleylamine and converts the Cu seeds into CuPd alloy nanoparticles with small sizes. Thus, as shown in the Supporting Information on details of the experiment, for Pd/Cu precursor ratios of 1:1, 2:1, and 2.5:1, the as-obtained CuPd alloy samples are denoted CuPd-1, CuPd-2, and CuPd-2.5, respectively.

The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the CuPd alloy nanoparticles at different Pd/Cu precursor ratios (i.e., CuPd-1, CuPd-2, and CuPd-2.5) are shown in Figure  $S1A_1$ ,  $B_1$ , and  $C_1$ , respectively, which show that the CuPd particles as-prepared in oleylamine/oleic acid are spherical, with mean sizes of ca. 5.6 nm for CuPd-1, 5.5 nm for CuPd-2, and 6.2 nm for CuPd-2.5, as shown in

Figure S1A6, B6, and C6 for the corresponding histograms. The alloy feature of the as‐prepared CuPd particles is confirmed by element mapping analyses of a number of arbitrarily selected particles under scanning TEM mode, as can be seen in Figure S1A2−A5, B2−B5, and C2−C5, which suggest the uniform distribution of Pd and Cu throughout each particulate sample. All the synthesized CuPd alloy nanoparticles were loaded on the XC‐72C substrate before electrochemical testing. The ORR catalytic performance of the CuPd nanoalloys with different Pd/Cu ratios in an alkaline electrolyte is studied. As can be seen in Figure S2, among the three alloy samples, the CuPd‐2 shows the highest half‐wave potential (0.9 V vs. RHE) and the largest current density (2.74 mA cm−<sup>2</sup> at 0.9 V vs. RHE), indicating its better ORR catalysis. Therefore, hereafter, we choose CuPd‐2 as the typical alloy sample to investigate the effect of acetic acid‐based dealloying on electrocatalysis.

CuPd‐2 alloy nanoparticles supported on a carbon substrate were subjected to acetic acid treatment at different temperatures for leaching of Cu atoms from their surface layers. As shown in Figure [1A1](#page-2-0)−A3 for the TEM images, the CuPd‐2 nanoparticles dealloyed by acetic acid at different temperatures (labeled CuPd‐D40, CuPd‐D120, and CuPd‐ D180 subjected to dealloying at 40°C, 120°C and 180°C, respectively) still retain their spherical morphologies and uniform dispersion on the carbon substrate, but their average particle sizes decrease slightly (see the corresponding histograms in Figure S3). The element mapping analyses of CuPd‐D40, CuPd‐D120, and CuPd‐D180 are shown in Figure [2A](#page-3-0)2−A5, B2−B5, and C2−C5, respectively, in which attenuation in Cu signals is observable in comparison with those of CuPd‐2. In addition, we compare the high‐ resolution high‐angle annular dark‐field scanning TEM (HAADF‐STEM) images of a single CuPd‐2 particle before and after dealloying at 120°C in acetic acid, as shown in Figure [1D,E](#page-2-0), respectively, in which a number of vacancies could be identified, as marked by the orange circles. Also, the atomic arrangement in the CuPd‐D120 particle (Figure [1E](#page-2-0)) looks more dense than that in the CuPd‐2 particle (Figure [1D\)](#page-2-0), and the interplanar spacing of CuPd‐D120 is 0.215 nm, while that of CuPd‐2 is 0.221 nm. All this information indirectly suggests the leaching of Cu atoms from surface layers of CuPd‐2 particles by acetic acid. More direct evidence to confirm the Cu leaching from CuPd alloy

particles is obtained from inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP‐AES) analyses, as shown in Table S1, in which the gradually increased Pd/Cu ratio after dealloying of CuPd‐2 in acetic acid at temperatures from 40°C to 180°C clearly indicates the loss of Cu atoms. Since the leaching of Cu atoms begins from the outer surface of the alloy particles, we may rationally deduce the development of a core–shell structure, in which a Pd‐enriched skin coats on an alloy CuPd core. In this core–shell structure, a compressive strain is generated in the Pd‐enriched skin, as described in Section [1.](#page-1-0)

## 2.2 | Characterizations of alloyed and dealloyed CuPd nanoparticles

The X‐ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of CuPd‐2 shows homogeneous peaks located between the standard face‐ centered cubic peaks of Pd and Cu metals, as shown in Figure [2](#page-3-0), also confirming the formation of the alloy phase. After dealloying in acetic acid at different temperatures, the as‐obtained CuPd‐D40, CuPd‐D120, and CuPd‐D180 samples retain the same crystal structure (Figure [2A\)](#page-3-0), but compared with the original CuPd‐2 alloy particles, their XRD peaks slightly move to high diffraction angles, as can be seen in Figure [2B](#page-3-0) for the partial enlargement of Figure [2A,](#page-3-0) also confirming that the leaching of Cu atoms from alloy CuPd nanoparticles induces a compressive lattice strain effect. Furthermore, this lattice strain effect turns to be apparent with leaching of more Cu atoms by acetic acid at higher temperatures.

The compressive lattice strain could increase the overlap of d orbitals of metal atoms and thus decrease their d‐band center.[31](#page-7-3)–<sup>34</sup> We integrate the X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) valence spectra of CuPd‐2,

<span id="page-3-1"></span>FIGURE 3 XPS and electrochemical characterizations. (A) XPS valence band spectra and CO stripping curves in 1 M KOH at a scan rate of 50 mV s−<sup>1</sup> of CuPd‐2, CuPd‐D40, CuPd‐D120, and CuPd‐D180 as well as (B) the commercial Pd/C catalyst.

CuPd‐D40, CuPd‐D120, and CuPd‐D180 as well as commercial Pd/C catalyst to determine the d‐band centers of Pd atoms, as shown in Figure [3A.](#page-3-1) Apparently, with increasing dealloying temperature, more Cu atoms are leached from the CuPd‐2 alloy particles, resulting in a more notable lattice strain effect and a relatively lower d‐ band center. In this sense, the Pd atoms in the CuPd‐ D180 sample have the lowest d‐band center.

The decrease in the d‐band center of the Pd atom in CuPd alloy nanoparticles before and after acetic dealloying can also be observed from their 3d XPS binding energies. In principle, the compressive strain would improve the stability of d electrons and thus increase the difficulty in ionization of the metal atoms, meaning that their XPS binding energies would increase.[33,45](#page-7-6) As shown in Figure S4, compared with those of commercial Pd/C and CuPd‐2, all the Pd 3d binding energies in dealloyed samples (i.e., CuPd‐D40, CuPd‐D120, and CuPd‐D180) apparently shift to higher values, confirming the lower d‐band positions in these dealloyed samples.

As described in detail in Section [1,](#page-1-0) the metal atoms with lower d‐band center are weak in absorbing oxygenated intermediates,[9,10,14,35](#page-6-1)–<sup>37</sup> and this could be confirmed by their electrochemical CO stripping tests. Figure [3B](#page-3-1) shows the CO stripping voltammograms for CuPd‐2, CuPd‐D40, CuPd‐D120, and CuPd‐D180 as well as the commercial Pd/C catalyst. As expected, on the dealloyed samples (i.e., CuPd‐D40, CuPd‐D120, and CuPd‐D180), the CO stripping potentials are lower than those on CuPd‐2 alloy particles and the commercial Pd/C catalyst, indicating more facile desorption of CO from the dealloyed particle surfaces. It is noteworthy that the CO stripping potential is less related to the dealloying temperature, suggesting that the CO stripping from metal surfaces is complicated and cannot be simply predicted by the single lattice compressive strain effect. Fortunately, the easy removal of oxygenated intermediates from dealloyed CuPd particles would definitely lead to high-efficiency electrocatalysis for the subsequent ORR and EOR.

# 2.3 | Electrocatalysis of alloyed and dealloyed CuPd nanoparticles

The CuPd-D40, CuPd-D120, CuPd-D180, and their alloy precursor (CuPd-2) as well as commercial Pd/C and Pt/C were used to catalyze ORR to determine the influence of dealloying on the catalytic performance. Normalized by the geometric area of the electrode, Figure 4A shows the ORR polarization curves of CuPd-2, CuPd-D40, CuPd-D120, and CuPd-D180 as well as Pd/C and Pt/C catalysts in an O<sub>2</sub>-saturated aqueous KOH solution (0.1 M), of which the half-

wave potential of CuPd-D120 is 0.912 V, which is higher than those of other dealloyed samples, that is, CuPd-D40 (0.902 V) and CuPd-D180 (0.904 V), its alloy precursor, that is, CuPd-2 (0.90 V), commercial Pd/C (0.811 V), and even commercial Pt/C catalyst (0.880 V). In particular, by normalizing the Pd mass loaded on the electrode, the CuPd-D120 presents the highest mass activity (0.213 A mg $_{Pd}^{-1}$ ) at 0.9 V for ORR compared with CuPd-2 (0.138 A mg $_{Pd}^{-1}$ ), CuPd-D40 (0.147 A mg $_{Pd}^{-1}$ ), CuPd-D180 (0.207 A mg $_{Pd}^{-1}$ ), the commercial Pd/C (0.032 A mg $_{Pd}^{-1}$ ), and the commercial Pt/C catalyst (0.075 A mg $_{Pd}^{-1}$ ).

To determine the ORR path on the dealloyed CuPd particles, we recorded the polarization curves of CuPd-D120 at different rotation rates (Figure 4B). As shown in the inset in Figure 4B, the linear Koutecky–Levich (K–L) plot suggests the first-order reaction kinetics related to the oxygen concentration, and by which the electron-transfer number (*n*) involved in the ORR process is 3.5–3.6, implying that the ORR mechanism on CuPd-D120 is dominated by the 4-electron pathway

in terms of  $O_2 + 2H_2O + 4e^- \rightarrow 4OH^{-.46,47}$  Good ORR activity of the CuPd-D120 is also clear from its much smaller Tafel slope of 39 mV dec<sup>-1</sup> at lower overpotentials (Figure S5) than those of CuPd-2 (52 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>), CuPd-D40 (51 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>), CuPd-D180 (42 mV  $dec^{-1}$ ), the commercial Pd/C catalyst (118 mV  $dec^{-1}$ ), and the commercial Pt/C catalyst (80 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>). In the meantime, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements confirm that all these catalysts consist of a semicircle, of which the CuPd-D120 has the smallest semicircle diameter (Figure 4C), indicating its lowest charge-transfer resistance towards ORR. We chose CuPd-D120 and compared its durability with its alloy precursor (CuPd-2) for ORR using a linear potential sweeps between 0.6 and 1.0 V at  $50 \,\mathrm{mV \, s^{-1}}$  in an O<sub>2</sub>-saturated 0.1 M KOH solution. As shown in Figure 4D, the polarization curves before and after the accelerated tolerance test (ADT) indicate that the CuPd-D120 has better stability. Further, as shown in Figure S6, after 10,000 cycles of ADT, the particle size of CuPd-2 increases significantly, while that of

CuPd-D120 remains basically unchanged, indicating that an appropriate dealloying process can not only improve the activity of CuPd alloy particles but also boost their stability for ORR electrocatalysis.

The dealloyed CuPd samples were also examined for their catalytic behavior for EOR at room temperature. Figure 5A shows the cyclic voltammograms (CVs) of CuPd-2, CuPd-D40, CuPd-D120, and CuPd-D180 recorded in a 1 M KOH electrolyte at a scan rate of 50 mV s<sup>-1</sup>. As can be seen, the dealloyed CuPd particles have larger ECSAs due to the exposure of more active Pd atoms. The ECSAs of CuPd-2, CuPd-D40, CuPd-D120, and CuPd-D180 are calculated to be 59.7, 64.7, 102.1, and 90.0 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>, respectively, based on the charge of the electrochemical reduction of the PdO monolayer and the actual Pd mass loading on the electrode.

Analogous to that for ORR, the CuPd-D120 also shows excellent catalytic activity towards EOR. Figure 5B,C shows the typical ethanol oxidation curves normalized by the ECSAs and Pd mass loading on the electrode, respectively. Among them, the CuPd-D120 has the highest specific activity  $(8.23 \text{ mA cm}^{-2})$  and mass activity  $(8.4 \text{ A mg}^{-1})$ . In particular, its mass activity is 4.4, 2.6, 2.0, and 1.4 times that of Pd/C (1.9 A mg<sup>-1</sup>), CuPd-2 (3.2 A mg<sup>-1</sup>), CuPd-D40 (4.1 A mg<sup>-1</sup>), and CuPd-D180 (5.8 A mg<sup>-1</sup>), respectively, as shown by the comparison in Figure 5D. In Figure 5E, the diameter of the impedance arc of the CuPd-D120 is smaller, suggesting that its charge-transfer resistance is lower during the EOR process. To study the stability of the catalyst for EOR, we conducted chronoamperometric tests for CuPd-D120 and CuPd-2 at 0.73 V in an electrolyte composed of 1 M KOH and 1 M ethanol for 10 h. As can be seen in Figure 5F, compared with CuPd-2, the CuPd-D120 has a slower current attenuation rate, suggesting its better durability for EOR. In addition, as shown in Figure S7, in contrast to the obvious aggregation of the CuPd-2, the nearly unchanged size and dispersion of the CuPd-D120 on a carbon substrate after stability tests are the reasons for its better EOR stability.

### 3 | CONCLUSION

In summary, to address the deficiencies associated with the commonly used electrochemical method and sulfuric acid/nitric acid treatment, we developed an acetic acid-based dealloying strategy to leach Cu atoms from the outer surface layers of CuPd alloy nanoparticles for achieving high-efficiency electrocatalysis in ORR and EOR in an alkaline medium. The leaching of Cu atoms creates an additional compressive strain in the surface layers and exposes more active Pd atoms, both of which contribute toward the high catalytic performance of dealloyed catalysts for ORR and EOR. Specifically, for ORR, the half-wave potential and mass activity of CuPd nanoalloys with a Pd/Cu molar ratio of 2:1 after acetic dealloying at 120°C for 0.5 h are 0.912 V (vs. RHE) and 0.213 A mg<sub>Pd</sub><sup>-1</sup> at 0.9 V, respectively, while for EOR, the mass activity and specific activity of the same dealloyed CuPd nanoparticles are 8.4 A mg<sup>-1</sup> and 8.23 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, respectively, which are much better than those of their dealloyed counterparts at other temperatures and commercial Pd/C as well as the Pt/C catalyst. The studies here enrich the dealloying strategies and confirm the effectiveness of dealloying for boosting the catalysis for typical electrochemical reactions.

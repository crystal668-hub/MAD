**Electrochemical ethanol oxidation is crucial to directly convert a biorenewable liquid fuel with high energy density into electrical energy, but it remains an inefficient reaction even with the best catalysts. To boost ethanol oxidation, developing multimetallic nanoalloy has emerged as one of the most effective strategies, yet faces a challenge in the rational engineering of multimetallic active-site ensembles at atomic-level. Herein, starting from typical PtCu nanocrystals, an atomic Sn diffusion strategy is developed to construct well-defined Pt47Sn12Cu41 octopod nanoframes, which is enclosed by high-index facets of** *n* **(111)-(111), such as {331} and {221}. Pt47Sn12Cu41 achieves a high mass activity of 3.10 A mg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> Pt and promotes the C-C bond breaking and oxidation of poisonous CO intermediate, representing a state-of-the-art electrocatalyst toward ethanol oxidation in acidic electrolyte. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations have confirmed that the introduction of Sn improves the electroactivity by uplifting the d-band center through the s-p-d coupling. Meanwhile, the strong binding of ethanol and the reduced energy barrier of CO oxidation guarantee a highly efficient ethanol oxidation process with improved Faradic efficiency of C1 products. This work offers a promising strategy for constructing novel multimetallic nanoalloys tailored by atomic metal sites as the efficient electrocatalysts.**

# **1. Introduction**

As an ideal liquid fuel, ethanol's chemical energy can be converted directly into electrical energy via direct ethanol fuel cells (DEFCs) which have several advantages over hydrogen fuel cells, such as high specific energy density (8.03 kWh Kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> or 6.34 kWh L<sup>−</sup>1), cost efficiency, low hazard concerns, and ease of transportation, storage, and handling;[\[1\]](#page-8-0) However, the anodic ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) is a very complicated and kinetically sluggish process involving the transfer of multiple electrons and various reaction intermediates, leading to the inefficient oxidation and undesired poisoning by carbonaceous species even on the best Pt-based electrocatalysts, especially in acidic electrolytes. As a result, the widespread deployment of DEFCs is hindered by the low mass activity and CO intermediates poisoning of Pt-based EOR electrocatalysts.[\[2–4\]](#page-8-0)

An advanced and effective strategy for enhancing EOR is to engineer multimetallic Pt-based nanocrystals, which could

promote the C-C bond breaking and the generation of oxygenated species for the oxidative removal of CO intermediate species.[\[5–9\]](#page-8-0) As a notable example, R. R. Adzic et al. developed a ternary Pt/Rh/SnO2 electrocatalyst which is capable of oxidizing ethanol to CO2, due to the specific property of each of its constituents, i.e., Pt facilitates ethanol dehydrogenation, and SnO2 with H2O provides OH species to oxidize the dissociated CO at Rh sites.[\[1\]](#page-8-0) By further designing the nanostructures with optimized sizes, dimensions, morphologies, and compositions, the well-tailored Pt-based multimetallic electrocatalysts can not only reduce the amount of Pt, but also greatly enhance the catalytic performance;[\[3,4\]](#page-8-0) However, the atomic-level engineering of multimetallic active-site ensembles remains as a huge challenge in the pursuit of maximizing atom utilization efficiency and multifunctional effects when handling these complex electrochemical reactions.[\[10,11\]](#page-8-0)

Herein, we report a sophisticated fabrication of ternary Pt47Sn12Cu41 octopod nanoframes with three-dimensional catalytic surfaces and beneficial high-index facets, via a facile wetchemical approach followed by atomic Sn diffusion. As a bestperforming EOR catalyst in acidic electrolyte, Pt47Sn12Cu41 exhibits a high mass activity of 3.10 A mg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> Pt and C1-pathway

selectivity of 16%, as well as a low on-set potential of 0.29 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) for CO oxidation, significantly outperforming commercial Pt/C and PtCu nanoframes. In situ infrared spectroscopy verifies a more negative potential for oxidizing ethanol into CO2, CH3CHO, and CH3COOH on the Pt47Sn12Cu41 catalyst. DFT calculations have compared the electronic structures and energetic trend for the EOR process on the catalysts with different concentrations of Sn and different facets. The appropriate concentration of Sn and high-index facets not only leads to a high d-band center but also decreases the energy barriers of EOR and CO oxidation, resulting in the significantly improved electroactivity.

### **2. Results and Discussion**

**Figure [1](#page-2-0)**a illustrates the rational design and construction of Pt47Sn12Cu41 octopod nanoframes, via the etching of Cu-rich PtCu octopod nanocrystals followed by the atomic Sn diffusion, and the experimental details are given in Supporting Information. In our design, the first step is the key to build the unique Pt47Sn12Cu41 electrocatalyst with a specific composition and an open-framework nanostructure, which could be easily prepared by improving the recipe developed in our early work.[\[12\]](#page-8-0) On the other hand, the fast diffusion of Sn atoms into face center cubic (*fcc*) Pt lattice has been successfully revealed by in situ synchrotron X‑ray scattering, leading to the formation of hexagonal close-packed (*hcp*) PtSn phase due to the reordering of Pt and Sn atoms in solution conditions. Interestingly, under a relatively low content of Sn, alloying Sn and Pt in the maintained *fcc* nanostructure is favored.[\[13\]](#page-8-0) Thus, for the first time, we introduce the Sn diffusion strategy in bimetallic nanocrystals to engineer trimetallic nanoalloys, and feed an appropriate content of Sn to enable the atomic Sn diffusion. By changing the feeding amounts of Sn, the structure and composition of Pt-Sn-Cu trimetallic nanoalloys can be elaborately controlled. This new type of seed-mediated approach can be extended to fabricate intriguing multimetallic nanostructures at atomic level.[\[14,15\]](#page-8-0)

In a typical synthesis, Pt16Cu84 octopod nanocrystals were obtained by hydrothermal method using a simple recipe of H2PtCl6·6H2O, Cu(NO3)2·3H2O, oleylamine, hexadecane trimethylammonium bromide, and ascorbic acid (Figure S1, Supporting Information). After the etching of Pt16Cu84 nanocrystals in acetic acid at 130 °C, the Pt41Cu59 octopod nanoframes with uniform dispersed nanostructure and composition were obtained (Figure S2, Supporting Information). The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of Pt41Cu59 shows a typical *fcc* PtCu alloy with diffraction peaks located between Pt and Pt16Cu84 (Figures [1b;](#page-2-0) Figure S3, Supporting Information). The transformation of Pt41Cu59 into Pt47Sn12Cu41 is achieved by heating the mixed solution of SnCl2 and Pt41Cu59 octopod nanoframes at 240 °C for 30 min in argon. In addition, Pt-SnCu octopod nanoframes with different ternary compositions (Pt45Sn5Cu50, Pt47Sn12Cu41, Pt48Sn19Cu33, Pt49Sn45Cu6) are controllably achieved by changing the amount of SnCl2, as determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) (Figures [1c;](#page-2-0) Figure S4−6, Supporting Information). Especially, as the atomic ratios of Sn increasing from 5% to 45%, the compositions of Pt basically remain unchanged while the compositions of Cu decrease correspondingly from 50% to 6%. Without Sn diffusion, the bimetallic composition and XRD diffraction patterns of *fcc* Pt41Cu59 are retained as *fcc* Pt43Cu57 (Figure S7, Supporting Information). These results indicate that Sn atoms substitute Cu atoms and the atomic Sn diffusion leads to the dealloying of Cu atoms; This phenomenon was also observed in an as-reported PtNi-Zn system.[\[16\]](#page-8-0) In this case, the reaction temperature of 240 °C and Ar atmosphere are critical for ensuring Sn diffusion into the PtCu lattices (Figures S8–10, Supporting Information). Furthermore, this Sn diffusion strategy has been extended to fabricate novel multimetallic nanoalloys, such as Pt-Sn-Ni, Pt-Sn-Rh-Cu, and Pt-Sn-Pd-Cu (Figures S11–13, Supporting Information).

In the XRD patterns of Pt45Sn5Cu50 and Pt47Sn12Cu41 (Figure [1b\)](#page-2-0), a new set of diffraction peaks is gradually derived at the original diffraction peaks of Pt41Cu59, and these new diffraction peaks locate between the diffraction peaks of standard *fcc* Pt (PDF#04-0802) and Pt41Cu59, excluding the formation of bimetallic PtSn or CuSn alloy (Figures S14 and 15, Supporting Information). As shown in the XRD pattern of Pt47Sn12Cu41, the peak fitting result reveals the co-existence of *fcc* PtSnCu diffraction peak at 40.5 degree and *fcc* PtCu diffraction peak at 41.8 degree, corresponding to the lattice spacing of 2.23 Å and 2.18 Å, respectively.[\[17\]](#page-8-0) These results could be attributed to the local formation of *fcc* PtSnCu alloy with expanded lattice spacings where the Sn atoms diffuse, and the fact that Sn has a larger atomic radius (140 pm) than Cu (128 pm).[\[18,19\]](#page-8-0) The diffraction peak (2 = 24.9°) assigned to *hcp* PtSn intermetallic (PDF#25-0614) is newly formed when the content of Sn increases to 19%, and the initial Pt41Cu59 nanocrystals are fully transformed into *hcp* PtSn intermetallic nanoframes in the presence of a trace amount of Cu when the content of Sn further increases to 45% (Figures S16 and S17, Supporting Information). As illustrated by the unit cell and atomic arrangements of *hcp* PtSn intermetallic, Sn atoms are intrinsically isolated in the ordered lattices, even though the atomic ratio of Sn reaches 50% (Figure S18, Supporting Information).[\[10\]](#page-8-0) These results indicate the fast diffusion, substitution, and ordering of Sn atoms in the PtCu bimetallic nanocrystals, presenting that feeding proper amounts of Sn enables the formation of novel PtSnCu nanoalloys tailored by atomically dispersed Sn atoms.

Figure [1c–h](#page-2-0) show the typical images of transmission electron microscope (TEM) and aberration-corrected high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscope (HAADF-STEM) of Pt47Sn12Cu41. The as-obtained Pt47Sn12Cu41 nanocrystals are the monodispersed octopod nanoframes in high quality and shape approaching 100% yield (Figures S19 and S20, Supporting Information). This open-framework architecture with clear edges and corners exhibits a narrow size distribution of 20.8 ± 2.2 nm, composed by ultrathin edges with average edge diameter of 2.7 ± 0.5 nm and symmetrical octopod with average length of 10.1 ± 1.3 nm (Figure S21, Supporting Information). The Pt/Sn/Cu atomic ratio analyzed by ICP-MS (47/12/41) is consistent with the energy dispersive Xray spectrum (EDS: 45.6/11.5/42.9), indicating the high purity of Pt47Sn12Cu41 nanocrystals (Figure S22, Supporting Information). Figures [1d](#page-2-0) and Figure S23 (Supporting Information) show the atomic-resolution HAADF-STEM image of octopod nanoframe oriented along the [110] zone axis, in which abundant steps and terrace atoms are clearly observed on the surfaces. As shown in Figure [1f,](#page-2-0) these stepped surfaces could be assigned to the

high-index facets with (111) terraces and (110) steps, which are usually represented by n (111)-(111) as (110) surface can be further divided into one unit of (111) terrace and (111) step. In this notation, n = 2, 3, and 4 correspond to the facets of (110), (331), and (221), respectively.[20,21] As shown by the fast Fourier transition pattern in Figure 1d and the detailed statistical analyses of crystalline lattices in Figures 1e and Figure S24 (Supporting Information), the co-existence of PtCu with an average lattice spacing of 2.18 Å and PtSnCu with an average lattice spacing of 2.24 Å is clearly revealed, which matches well with the XRD results. Especially, the diffraction peak area ratio of fcc PtSnCu (111) and fcc PtCu (111) in  $Pt_{47}Sn_{12}Cu_{41}$  is 5.7/1, indicating that most of the fcc PtCu lattices (85.1%) are modified by Sn atoms. The high content of fcc PtSnCu could be ascribed to the fast kinetics of atomic Sn diffusion with a high content (12.0%) into the 3D accessible ultrathin PtCu octopod nanoframes, which is further strengthened by the EDS element mapping images that Pt, Sn, and Cu elements are overlapped throughout the octopod nanoframes (Figure 1h).<sup>[13,17]</sup> These results indicate the uniform and conformal Sn diffusion into the PtCu lattices.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) were adopted to analyze the electronic states of  $Pt_{47}Sn_{12}Cu_{41}$ . The XPS spectra of Pt 4f, Cu 2p, and Sn 3d spectrum in **Figure 2a**–c indicate the existence of electronic coupling among Pt, Sn, and Cu atoms and the co-existence of metallic state and oxidation states in these elements (Figure S25, Supporting Information). The binding energies of Pt 4f and Cu 2p show noticeable positive shifts by 0.33 and 0.23 eV, respectively, revealing that electrons transfer from Pt and Cu to Sn. Due to the higher oxygen affinity of Sn atoms on the surface, the oxidized Sn appears after being exposed to air. Furthermore, the XPS in-depth analyses of  $Pt_{47}Sn_{12}Cu_{41}$  reveal that after sputtering by an argon ion gun for 2.5 min, the content of Sn<sup>0</sup> increased to 67.7%, indicating that Sn atoms are diffused into the *fcc* PtCu

octopod nanoframes, forming fcc PtSnCu alloy instead of SnO<sub>v</sub> species (Figures 2c; Figure S26, Supporting Information).[23,24] The X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra of Pt L3-edge and Cu K-edge suggest that Pt is in metallic state and Cu mainly presents as metal state (Figures 2d; Figure S27a, Supporting Information). The XANES spectra reveal the Sn K-edge of Pt<sub>47</sub>Sn<sub>12</sub>Cu<sub>41</sub> shifted to a higher absorption energy compared with metal Sn foil but lower than that of SnO<sub>2</sub> (Figure 2e), indicating the increase of Sn oxidation states compared with metal Sn foil. As shown in Figure \$28 (Supporting Information), the average oxidation state of Sn in  $Pt_{47}Sn_{12}Cu_{41}$  is calculated to be +2.75, which is in line with XPS results. Figure 2f,g and Figure S27b (Supporting Information) show the Fourier transform extended X-ray absorption fine structures (FT-EXAFS) for Pt L3-edge, Cu K-edge, and Sn K-edge of Pt<sub>47</sub>Sn<sub>12</sub>Cu<sub>41</sub> and reference samples. The spectra of Pt<sub>47</sub>Sn<sub>12</sub>Cu<sub>41</sub> display the main peak at 2.49 Å for Pt and 2.26 Å for Cu, which are located between PtO<sub>2</sub>/CuO and Pt (2.56 Å)/Cu foil (2.22 Å), respectively, indicating the formation of PtSnCu alloy (Figure S29, Supporting Information).[23,25-27] The FT-EXAFS fitting results for Sn K-edge of  $Pt_{47}Sn_{12}Cu_{41}$  feature two scattering peaks ≈1.60 Å (Sn-O) and 2.18 Å (Sn-Pt/Sn-Cu), and show the absence of Sn-O-Sn (3.45 Å) and Sn-Sn (2.80 Å) ensembles which are observed in the bulk SnO2 standard and Sn foil (Figure 2g; Figures S29-33 and Table S1, Supporting Information). EXAFS wavelet transform (WT) analysis of the Sn Kedge was performed to further verify the coordination structure and provide useful resolution in both K and R spaces (Figure 2h). As illustrated by the WT contour plots of Sn foil and SnO2, the intensity maxima are attributed to the Sn-O, Sn-Sn, and Sn-O-Sn contributions, respectively. In Pt<sub>47</sub>Sn<sub>12</sub>Cu<sub>41</sub>, an intensity maximum at  $\approx$ 5 Å $^{-1}$  related to the Sn-O coordination and an intensity peak at  $\approx 10 \text{ Å}^{-1}$  related to the Sn-Pt/Sn-Cu are observed, in consistency with Sn K-edge EXAFS spectra. These results reveal that Sn atoms are atomically diffused into the fcc PtCu octopod nanoframes.[27-29]

The electrocatalytic properties of PtSnCu with different Sn compositions are evaluated toward EOR. Pt41 Cu59 and commercial Pt/C electrocatalysts are also measured under the same conditions for comparison. As shown by the cyclic voltammograms (CVs) in Figures 3a and Figure S34 (Supporting Information), benefiting from their open-framework nanostructures,  $Pt_{47}Sn_{12}Cu_{41}$  (50.8 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>),  $Pt_{41}Cu_{59}$  (52.2 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>), and  $Pt_{49}Sn_{45}Cu_6$  (55.3  $m^2\ g^{-1})$  exhibit higher electrochemical active area than that of Pt/C (47.2 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>).<sup>[30]</sup> Figures 3b and Figure S35 (Supporting Information) show the specific activities of different electrocatalysts, in which Pt<sub>47</sub>Sn<sub>12</sub>Cu<sub>41</sub> achieves the highest value of 6.1 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> compared with Pt/C (1.05 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>),  $Pt_{41}Cu_{59}$ (2.63 mA cm $^{-2}$ ), and  $Pt_{49}Sn_{45}Cu_6$  (2.07 mA cm $^{-2}$ ). In addition, Pt<sub>47</sub>Sn<sub>12</sub>Cu<sub>41</sub> exhibits a negative on-set potential toward EOR, which is 156, 72, and 92 mV lower than that of commercial Pt/C,  $Pt_{41}Cu_{59}$ , and  $Pt_{49}Sn_{45}Cu_{6}$ , respectively. As shown in Figures 3c and Figure S36 (Supporting Information),  $Pt_{47}Sn_{12}Cu_{41}$  achieves a record-high peak mass activity of 3.10 A mg<sup>-1</sup> Pt, which is 6.3, 2.2, 1.3, 1.4, and 2.7 times higher than Pt/C, Pt<sub>41</sub>Cu<sub>59</sub>, Pt<sub>45</sub>Sn<sub>5</sub>Cu<sub>50</sub>, Pt<sub>48</sub>Sn<sub>19</sub>Cu<sub>33</sub>, and Pt<sub>49</sub>Sn<sub>45</sub>Cu<sub>6</sub>, outperforming the state-of-the-art EOR electrocatalysts previously reported in the literature (Figure 3e; Table S2, Supporting Information). [2-7,9,21,31,32] These results illustrate the extraordinary effects of sophisticated structure (octopod nanoframes enclosed by high-index facets)

and composition (a high content of trimetallic  $\mathit{fcc}$  PtSnCu) engineering in boosting EOR.

During the electrochemical ethanol oxidation, C2-pathway refers to the formation of acetic acid by delivering four electrons and acetaldehyde by delivering two electrons, and C1-pathway refers to the complete oxidation of ethanol through the breaking of C-C bond and the transfer of twelve electrons.[1,33] The production of acetic acid and acetaldehyde in the electrolytes could be accurately quantified by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and static headspace-gas chromatography coupled with a flame ionization detector, respectively (Figures \$37-39, Supporting Information).[33-36] As a result, Pt<sub>47</sub>Sn<sub>12</sub>Cu<sub>41</sub> shows the enhanced possible C1-pathway selectivity of 16% (calculated by 100% - Faradaic efficiency of C2-pathway) in comparison with Pt/C and Pt<sub>41</sub>Cu<sub>59</sub> (Figure 3d). The electrochemical durability of different catalysts was evaluated by CV scanning for 1 000 cycles. After 1 000 cycles, the mass activity of Pt<sub>47</sub>Sn<sub>12</sub>Cu<sub>41</sub> maintained 92.5% of the initial value (Figures 3f; Figure S40, Supporting Information), which is 8.2, 2.4, and 2.4 times higher than that of commercial Pt/C, Pt<sub>41</sub>Cu<sub>59</sub>, and Pt<sub>49</sub>Sn<sub>45</sub>Cu<sub>6</sub> catalysts (Figure S41, Supporting Information). Pt<sub>47</sub>Sn<sub>12</sub>Cu<sub>41</sub> exhibits excellent structural stability after 1 000 CV cycles, as demonstrated by the well-maintained morphology and composition. In addition, the high-index facets of n (111)-(111) are well preserved on the Pt<sub>47</sub>Sn<sub>12</sub>Cu<sub>41</sub> surface after 1 000 CV cycles (Figure S42, Supporting Information). As for Pt<sub>49</sub>Sn<sub>45</sub>Cu<sub>6</sub>, Sn atoms with an ultrahigh content were dealloyed, leading to the partial structural collapse of octopod nanoframes and the formation of SnO<sub>v</sub> species (Figure S43, Supporting Information). As illustrated by the COstripping experiments in Figure 3g, Pt/C exhibits a high on-set potential of 0.79 V versus RHE toward CO oxidation, indicating easy poisoning by CO<sub>ad</sub> species. Impressively, both Pt<sub>47</sub>Sn<sub>12</sub>Cu<sub>41</sub> and Pt<sub>49</sub>Sn<sub>45</sub>Cu<sub>6</sub> have a distinctly low on-set potential of 0.29 V versus RHE, which is 500 and 470 mV more negative than that of Pt/C and Pt<sub>41</sub>Cu<sub>59</sub>, respectively. This result indicates that the incorporation of Sn remarkably enhances the anti-poisoning ability toward CO. As shown in Figure S44 (Supporting Information) by the chronoamperometric curves, Pt<sub>47</sub>Sn<sub>12</sub>Cu<sub>41</sub> exhibits much higher current densities compared with Pt<sub>41</sub>Cu<sub>59</sub>, Pt<sub>49</sub>Sn<sub>45</sub>Cu<sub>6</sub>, and Pt/C catalysts during 20 000 s, indicating the long-term durability and anti-poisoning ability toward the intermediates produced during EOR. Thus, the better stability of Pt<sub>47</sub>Sn<sub>12</sub>Cu<sub>41</sub> could be ascribed to the superior anti-poisoning ability toward CO and intermediates, and the excellent structural stability in size, shape, composition, and surface (Figure S45, Supporting Information).[37–39]

In situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy was used to identify intermediates and products in the electrochemical oxidation of ethanol, as shown in Figures 3h,i and Figure S46 (Supporting Information). The characteristic peak of  $CO_2$  (at  $\approx 2343$  cm<sup>-1</sup>) corresponds to the complete oxidation of  $CH_3CH_2OH$ , namely C1-pathway.

and a trace amount of bridged binding CO (CO $_{\rm B}$ ) bands at 1919 cm $^{-1}$  is found in Pt $_{\rm 47}$ Sn $_{\rm 12}$ Cu $_{\rm 41}$ . [<sup>42,43</sup>] By comparing the area ratios of the CO $_{\rm 2}$ /CO infrared bands at a potential of 0.5 V versus saturated calomel electrode (SCE), the CO $_{\rm 2}$ /CO ratios of Pt $_{\rm 47}$ Sn $_{\rm 12}$ Cu $_{\rm 41}$  are 5.5 and 2.1 times higher than that of Pt/C and Pt $_{\rm 41}$ Cu $_{\rm 59}$ , respectively. These results reveal that Pt $_{\rm 47}$ Sn $_{\rm 12}$ Cu $_{\rm 41}$  exhibits an enhanced ability to oxidize CO, which is consistent with the CO-stripping curve in Figure 3g. [<sup>44,45</sup>] Moreover, Pt $_{\rm 47}$ Sn $_{\rm 12}$ Cu $_{\rm 41}$  began to produce acetaldehyde, acetic acid, and carbon dioxide at the potential of 0.2 V versus SCE, which is much lower than that of Pt/C (0.4 V vs SCE), verifying the high electrocatalytic performance of Pt $_{\rm 47}$ Sn $_{\rm 12}$ Cu $_{\rm 41}$  toward EOR.

To investigate the EOR reaction mechanism, we have further introduced DFT calculations to explore the electroactivity from electronic structure and energetic trends. The introduction of Sn has induced a significant change in the bonding and antibonding orbitals near the Fermi level, which are the most electroac-

tive orbitals contributing to electron transfer during electrocatalysis (Figure 4a). In particular, for the bonding orbitals near the Fermi level (E<sub>F</sub>), the electrons in these orbitals are the most electroactive ones to exchange and transfer with the intermediates during the electrocatalysis with the smallest energy barriers. Pristine Pt surfaces have shown highly ordered electronic distributions, which usually lead to weak selectivity and strong CO poisoning effects on the surface of catalysts. For the Pt41 Cu59 alloy, we notice that the surface electronic distributions have been evidently perturbed, where both Pt and Cu sites contribute to the bonding orbitals (Figure 4b). The high concentration of Sn in Pt<sub>49</sub>Sn<sub>45</sub>Cu<sub>6</sub> leads to a less electronic-rich catalyst surface, which largely weakens the capability of electron transfer towards the intermediates (Figure 4c). In comparison, Pt and Cu dominate the bonding orbitals while Sn mainly contributes to the antibonding orbitals in the Pt<sub>47</sub>Sn<sub>12</sub>Cu<sub>41</sub>, leading to a high concentration of bonding orbitals with more electroactive electrons to

guarantee the efficient transfer (Figure 4d). We then further compared the projected partial density of states (PDOS) to unravel the detailed electronic structures. Compared to pristine Pt, Pt-5d orbitals show slight upshifting in Pt41Cu59, and the Cu shows evident peaks near the Fermi level (EF) (Figure 4e). However, for Pt49Sn45Cu6 with high Sn concentration, both Cu-3d and Pt-5d orbitals have been significantly suppressed to a deeper position, leading to a much lower electroactivity for EOR (Figure 4f). In comparison, we notice that such suppression is absent in the Pt47Sn12Cu41, where both Pt-5d and Cu-3d located near the EF with high electroactivity (Figure 4g). Moreover, Sn-s,p orbitals have shown a broad coverage and cross the EF, which further guarantees a highly efficient site-to-site electron transfer. Meanwhile, we have also investigated the PDOS of PtCu alloys with oxidized Sn doped on both (311) and (111) surfaces, and the PtSnCu alloys derived from *hcp* PtSn structure. For the *fcc* Pt47Sn12Cu41 (311) structure with oxidation on surface Sn sites, the overall electronic structures are not evidently affected, indicating that oxidation of surface Sn sites is not the key factor for the electroactivity enhancement (Figure S47a, Supporting Information). In addition, the Pt47Sn12Cu41 (111) structure has displayed a higher electron density near the Fermi level due to the contributions of surface oxygen on Sn sites (Figure S47b, Supporting Information). For the Pt47Sn12Cu41 (001) surface based on *hcp* PtSn, we have noticed much stronger distortion than the *fcc* structure, leading to reduced stability (Figure S47c, Supporting Information). The downshifting of both Pt-5d and Cu-3d orbitals also indicates the decreased electroactivity for the EOR.

The d-band center comparisons of different electrocatalysts have been demonstrated, where Pt has shown the d-band

center at EV-2.45 eV (EV = 0 eV) (Figure [4h\)](#page-6-0). As the Sn introduction increases, the d-band center has evidently increased to EV-2.33 eV for the Pt47Sn12Cu41 (111) surface. In comparison, the high index facets of Pt47Sn12Cu41 also uplift the d-band center, where Pt47Sn12Cu41 (331) surfaces show the highest d-band center at EV-2.00 eV, supporting the highest electroactivity; However, the d-band center of Pt49Sn45Cu6 has been lowered to EV-2.49 eV, indicating that excess Sn results in poor electroactivity for EOR. The PDOS of different facets in Pt47Sn12Cu41 also confirms the overall upshifting of Pt-5d and Cu-3d orbitals for the improved electroactivity from (111) to (331) surface (Figure [4i\)](#page-6-0). Subsequently, we further explored the site-dependent electronic structures through the PDOS. From the bulk to the surface, Pt-5d orbitals not only upshift toward EF but also become more concentrated. These support an efficient electron transfer on the catalyst surface (Figure [4j\)](#page-6-0). In the meantime, the Cu-3d has shown a highly stable electronic structure from bulk to the surface, which guarantees robust electroactivity and stability during the EOR process (Figure [4k\)](#page-6-0). From the incorporated Sn sites, the electron density of s,p orbitals become stronger from the bulk to the surface, supporting the higher electroactivity of catalyst surface (Figure [4l\)](#page-6-0). The enhanced electron density also facilitates the siteto-site electron transfer. To further indicate the influences of the atomic geometric configurations on the electroactivity, the corresponding electronic structures with different coordination environments for the surface Pt and Cu sites in Pt47Sn12Cu41. For the surface of Pt47Sn12Cu41, Pt sites on the kink of the high-index surface show obviously higher d-band center than the flat (111) surface, which supports the significant role of high index face for improving electroactivity (Figure S47d, Supporting Information). A similar phenomenon is also observed for Cu sites, where the downshifting of Cu-3d orbitals is noted on the flat (111) surface (Figure S47e, Supporting Information). The highest d-band center of Pt and Cu sites on the kink (311) surface is surrounded by two Sn sites, where more Sn sites slightly increase the d-band center of Pt sites (Figure S47f,g, Supporting Information). These indicate the electrons transfer from Pt/Cu to Sn on the high index facets, which significantly improves electroactivity. In contrast, for the flat (111) surface, more Sn sites near the surface Pt and Cu sites lead to a slight decrease of the d-band center, where the coordination with 1 Sn site exhibits the highest d-band center, supporting the suitable Sn concentrations is critical for optimizing the overall electroactivity.

Last, we have also compared the energetic trend for the EOR process. For the initial adsorption of ethanol, we noticed that Pt shows very weak binding strength, presenting poor electroactivity (Figure [4m\)](#page-6-0). With the introduction of Sn, the binding strength becomes much stronger, where the Pt47Sn12Cu41 (331) surface shows the lowest binding energy of −0.21 eV to support the high electroactivity. For the EOR process, we noticed that the initial dehydrogenations prefer the C-H dissociation rather than the O-H dissociation with 0.33 eV energy barrier (Figure [4n\)](#page-6-0). The following dehydrogenations show a continuous downhill trend till the formation of CH3CO\*. The further oxidation of CH3CO\* to acetic acid is also energetically favorable. The high preference for forming acetic acid and acetaldehyde is consistent with the high Faradic efficiency of C2 products. In comparison, the dissociation of C-C bonds requires a minor energy barrier of 0.11 eV to form CO\*, enhancing the selectivity of the C1 pathway. Further oxidation to CO2 shows an energy release of 0.39 eV, which supports the co-existence of the C1 and C2 pathways during the EOR. To further understand the CO oxidation, we also compared the oxidation preference of CO on the Pt41Cu59 and Pt47Sn12Cu41 (Figure [4o\)](#page-6-0). It is noted that the introduction of Sn has evidently alleviated the energy barriers of CO oxidation from 1.22 eV in Pt41Cu59 to 0.59 eV in Pt47Sn12Cu41, indicating the much improved CO anti-poisoning capability in Pt47Sn12Cu41. These results support the high CO2/CO ratio in Pt47Sn12Cu41 during the experimental characterizations. Therefore, both electronic structures and energetic trends confirm the high electroactivity of Pt47Sn12Cu41 for the EOR process.

## **3. Conclusion**

In summary, we have successfully achieved the PtSnCu octopod nanoframes by developing a novel atomic Sn diffusion strategy. Benefiting from the open-framework nanostructure covered by trimetallic component and high-index facets, Pt47Sn12Cu41 exhibits the highest mass activity of 3.10 A mg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> Pt, excellent stability, and superior anti-CO poisoning ability toward EOR in acidic electrolyte. Specifically, the atomic Sn tailoring enables a much lower on-set potential for oxidation of ethanol and CO, and facilitates the breaking of C-C bonds, thus resulting in 2.2- and 6.3-times higher mass activity than those of Pt41Cu59 and Pt/C, respectively. DFT calculations have unraveled the origins of the remarkable EOR performances on Pt47Sn12Cu41, where the optimized d-band center and site-to-site electron transfer induced by Sn incorporation are the pivotal factors. The optimized electronic structure further reduces the energy barriers of both EOR and CO oxidation and results in superior electrocatalytic performances. Atomic diffusion could serve as a generic strategy to facilitate the exploration of advanced multimetallic catalysts with high atom utilization for a wide range of applications.

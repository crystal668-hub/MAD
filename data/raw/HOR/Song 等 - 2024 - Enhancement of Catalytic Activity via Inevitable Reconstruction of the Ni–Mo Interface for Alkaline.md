# **Enhancement of Catalytic Activity via Inevitable Reconstruction of the Ni–Mo Interface for Alkaline Hydrogen Oxidation**

**The inevitable oxidation of nickel-metal-based catalysts exposed to the air will lead to instability and poor reproducibility of a catalytic interface, which is usually ignored and greatly hinders their application for the catalysis of alkaline hydrogen oxidation. The details on the formation of a world-class nickel-based HOR catalyst Ni3-MoOx/C-500 are reported via an interfacial reconstruction triggered by passive oxidation upon air exposure. Interfacial reconstruction, initiated with various Ni–Mo metal ratios and annealing temperature, can fine-tune the Ni–Mo interface with an increased work function and a reduced d-band center. The optimized Ni3-MoOx/C exhibits a record high mass activity of 102.8 mA mgNi<sup>−</sup>1, a top-level exchange current density of 76.5 μA cmNi<sup>−</sup>2, and exceptional resistance to CO poisoning at 1000 ppm CO for hours. The catalyzed alkaline exchange membrane fuel cell exhibits a maximum power output of 600 mW cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> and excellent stability, ranking it as one of the most active non-precious metals HOR catalysts to date.**

# **1. Introduction**

Alkaline Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells (AEMFCs) are more cost-effective as compared to proton exchange membrane fuel cells because their relatively mild alkaline environment allows the use of non-precious metal catalysts.[\[1–3\]](#page-6-0) Nickel with significant intrinsic catalytic activity for hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) is a promising non-precious metal catalyst.[\[4–8\]](#page-6-0) Nickelbased catalysts have been developed significantly, for example, in terms of resistance to CO and NH3 poisoning as well as antioxidant potentials exceeding 0.8 V.[\[9–11\]](#page-6-0) However, compared to platinum-based catalysts, the Ni-based catalysts have two to three orders of magnitude lower exchange current density and an order

of magnitude lower mass activity, leading to a four to five times lower performance in fuel cells.[\[12\]](#page-6-0) For example, the latest developed NiCuCr/C catalyst exhibited an excellent mass activity of 72.6 A gM<sup>−</sup>1, [\[13\]](#page-6-0) only 1/7 of Pt/C.[\[14\]](#page-6-0) These drawbacks make Ni-based catalysts far from commercialization application, hence improvement of their HOR activity is urgently needed.[\[15\]](#page-6-0) Bimetallic Ni-Mo-based catalysts are a widely studied type of HOR catalyst.[\[16–19\]](#page-6-0)

Generally, the surface of non-precious metal catalysts changes readily with the environment, and surface reconstruction is inevitable, which dramatically affects catalytic activity.[\[20–22\]](#page-6-0) However, such reconstruction is usually random, uncontrollable, and overlooked. This is because the surface of Ni is oxidized rapidly and easily once exposed to air, leading to dramatic surface reconstruction.[\[23\]](#page-6-0) Here we report

on, instead, fine-tuning the Ni–Mo interface using interfacial reconstruction triggered by a passive oxidation process upon air exposure. In combination with different Ni/Mo atomic ratios and annealing temperatures, the interfacial reconstruction can tune the work function and the d-band center of the catalyst. As shown in **Figure [1](#page-1-0)**, the metallic nickel nanoparticles confined in the amorphous MoOx (Mo has various valence states), donated as Niy-MoOx/C-T (where y represents the Ni/Mo feeding atomic ratio and T represents the annealing temperature), were prepared by traditional solvothermal reaction plus H2 reduction (see the experimental section for details). During the H2 reduction, all Ni atoms and part of Mo atoms are reduced to the metallic state at the surface. The interfacial reconstruction of the original Niy-MoOx/C-T, induced by air exposure, leads to a rearrangement of the Ni, Mo, and O atoms at the Ni–Mo interface, which is regulated by the annealing temperature and the Ni/Mo feeding atom ratio. In this way, a specific Ni–Mo interfaces with an increased work function, and a reduced d-band center is obtained. The bestperforming catalyst, Ni3-MoOx/C-500, exhibits a large increase in mass activity, which is almost the same order of magnitude as that of the platinum-based catalyst. A record high mass activity of 102.8 mA mgNi<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> and a top-level exchange current density of 76.5 μA cmNi<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> were achieved. Moreover, exceptional resistance to CO poisoning has also been achieved against high CO impurities up to 1000 ppm for one hour. The catalyzed AEMFC has a

maximum power output of 600 mW cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> in H2/O2 and 400 mW cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> in H2/air, which can also steady output current for more than 24 h, ranking it as one of the most active non-precious metallic HOR catalysts to date.

# **2. Results and Discussion**

The synthesis of Niy-MoOx/C-500 was monitored by using the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (**Figure 2**; Figure S2, Supporting Information). Typically, the precursors of Ni3-MoOx/C-500 catalyst, obtained from the solvothermal method, are wrinkled ultrathin bimetallic hydroxide nanosheets with a thickness ≈3 nm (Figure 2a–c). After H2-annealing at 500 °C, the metallic Ni nanoparticles with the average size of 18.3 nm were formed within MoOx phase (Figure 2d–f; Figure S3, Supporting Information). The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM, Figure 2g) image shows clearly the Ni–MoOx interface with well-defined lattice fringes, where the planar spacings of 0.206 nm for Ni (111) and 0.348 nm for MoO3 (210). The element mapping images of Ni3-

MoO<sub>v</sub>/C-500 verify a uniform distribution of Ni, Mo, and O elements (Figure 2h).

The HOR activity of  $\mathrm{Ni_y}\text{-MoO}_\mathrm{x}/\mathrm{C-T}$  and commercial 20% Pt/C was evaluated in a H<sub>2</sub>-saturated 0.1 м KOH solution, using a standard three-electrode system with a rotating disk electrode (RDE). The pronounced anodic currents were obtained on the Ni<sub>v</sub>-MoO<sub>2</sub>/C-T modified electrode in H<sub>2</sub>-saturated electrolytes compared to those in N<sub>2</sub>-saturated electrolytes (Figure 3a,b; Figures S7 and S8, Supporting Information). This indicates that the current originates from HOR rather than Ni oxidation. The kinetic current densities  $(j_k)$  of the Ni<sub>v</sub>-MoO<sub>x</sub>/C-500 catalysts produced, obtained from the Koutechy-Levich equation, increased from 3.04 to 5.14 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> as the Ni/Mo ratio rose from 1 to 3 at Ni loading of 50 μg cm<sup>-2</sup> (Figure S9, Supporting Information). Further increasing the Ni/Mo ratio, however, leads to a decrease of  $j_k$  to 2.14 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> (Ni<sub>4</sub>-MoO<sub>v</sub>/C-500). Interestingly, these values exceed that of the commercial 20% Pt/C by at least 20.2% (1.78 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> at Pt loading of 5 μg cm<sup>-2</sup>). In addition, the Ni<sub>3</sub>-MoO<sub>x</sub>/C-500 significantly outperforms the Ni<sub>3</sub>-MoO<sub>x</sub>/C-300 and Ni<sub>3</sub>-MoO<sub>v</sub>/C-400 for the catalysis of HOR, indicating temperature-dependent HOR activity. With the annealing temperature increasing from 300 to 500 °C, the exchange current densities  $(j_0)$  increase from 0.19 to 1.35 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, among which the  $j_0$  of Ni<sub>3</sub>-MoO<sub>x</sub>/C-500 is even superior to that of 20% Pt/C (0.79 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>) (Figure S10, Supporting Information). Normalized to the electrochemical specific area (ECSA), the high  $j_{0, \, \text{ECSA}}$ of 76.5  $\mu$ A cm<sub>Ni</sub><sup>-2</sup> is obtained for Ni<sub>3</sub>-MoO<sub>x</sub>/C-500 (Figure S14 and Table S3, Supporting Information).

activity of Ni<sub>3</sub>-MoO<sub>y</sub>/C-500 catalyst, a significant factor of HOR catalyst, is calculated to be 102.8 mA mg<sub>Ni</sub><sup>-1</sup>, ranking the Ni<sub>3</sub>-MoO<sub>x</sub>/C-500 catalyst as the best Ni-based HOR catalyst available (Figure 3d and Table S3, Supporting Information). Based on these result, it can be concluded that the annealing temperature and the Ni/Mo ratio are the key factors for the enhancement of HOR activity, which is worthy of depth investigation and we will discussed later. The stability of Ni<sub>3</sub>-MoO<sub>x</sub>/C-500 was evaluated by the accelerated durability test (ADT) using CV cycles. The apparent current density decreased by only 8% after 15 000 CV cycles and by 23% after 30 000 cycles, providing excellent stability (Figure 3e).

It is well known that a few ppm CO can lead to severe poisoning for the platinum-based catalysts, and the CO tolerance is recognized as an important property for HOR catalysts. [24] Therefore, the CO tolerance of Ni<sub>3</sub>-MoO<sub>4</sub>/C-500 was also evaluated by using the chronopotentiometry experiments at 0.1 V (vs RHE) in an H<sub>2</sub> gas with a high concentration of CO (up to 1000 ppm CO). As shown in Figure 3f, the Ni<sub>3</sub>-MoO<sub>x</sub>/C-500 can steadily catalyze HOR even in hydrogen with 1000 ppm CO. A tiny current drop of  $\approx$ 6% was detected after 1h. of continuous operation, indicating an excellent tolerance to CO poisoning. In contrast, the current density of the Pt/C rapidly decreased by 84.34% in 35 min.

The performance of the AEMFC employing the Ni<sub>3</sub>-MoO<sub>x</sub>/C-500 catalyzed anode with a Ni loading of 1.6 mg<sub>Ni</sub> cm<sup>-2</sup> is shown in Figure 3g,h. The Pt/C catalyst was used as a cathode at a Pt loading of 0.4 mg<sub>Pt</sub> cm<sup>-2</sup>. The maximum power output reached 600 mW cm<sup>-2</sup> in  $H_2/O_2$  and 400 mW cm<sup>-2</sup> in  $H_2/Air$ 

(Figure 3g). The specific power output of the Ni<sub>3</sub>-MoO<sub>y</sub>/C-500 catalyzed AEMFC reached 380 mW mg<sub>Ni</sub><sup>-1</sup> which is among the highest record reported recently (Figure 3i). The stability of Ni<sub>3</sub>-MoO<sub>v</sub>/C-500 catalyzed AEMFC was evaluated at 200 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, a common current at fuel cell application.[11,25] As shown in Figure 3h, almost no decay was observed in 30 h of continuous operation for the Ni<sub>3</sub>-MoO<sub>x</sub>/C-500 catalyzed AEMFC. Even at a higher current density of  $1000~\text{mA}~\text{cm}^{-2}$ , the AEMFC can still run stably for more than 6 h (Figure S15, Supporting Information). These results indicate that the as-developed catalyst has great potential for fuel cell application.

Such record-breaking HOR activity was further investigated using a surface-sensitive detection, in situ X-ray electron spectroscopy (in situ XPS). As the surface of non-precious metal catalysts changes readily with the environment which dramatically affects the catalytic activity, [26] the Ni<sub>3</sub>-MoO<sub>v</sub>/C-T catalysts were synthesized in the reaction chamber that is connected to the XPS chamber. Two states of catalysts were evaluated, i.e., the original state after annealing under H2 and the reconstructed state after exposure to air. As shown in Figure 4a, the Ni of Ni<sub>3</sub>-MoO<sub>y</sub>/C-300 is in a fully oxidized state before and after exposure to air. Considering together with its weak HOR activity, this result suggested oxidized state of Ni is not the active site for HOR. Significant HOR activity was obtained at an annealing temperature above 400 °C. In both Ni<sub>3</sub>-MoO<sub>v</sub>/C-400 and Ni<sub>3</sub>-MoO<sub>v</sub>/C-500, certain metallic Ni were detected, suggesting that Ni<sup>0</sup> is the decisive factor of HOR activity. Interestingly, both of them were entirely reduced to Ni<sup>0</sup> in a hydrogen atmosphere, while only  $\approx 12\%$

metallic Ni remained on the surface after exposure to air (Figure S19, Supporting Information). These mean a significant reconstruction of the surface occurred during the catalyst preparation, and only a small amount of Ni in the catalyst is used for HOR.

Notably, the Ni3-MoOx/C-500 shows *j* <sup>0</sup> of 1.35 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> for HOR, which is 1.73 times higher than that of Ni3-MoOx/C-400 (Figure S10, Supporting Information). However, both Ni3- MoOx/C-400 and Ni3-MoOx/C-500 show essentially the same Ni state and similar surface oxygen state before and after exposure to air (Figure [4a;](#page-3-0) Figure S19, Supporting Information). This result indicates that there is another decisive factor on the surface during the surface reconstruction. Therefore, an analysis of the Mo state was further carried out. As shown in Figures [4b](#page-3-0) and S19 (Supporting Information), compared with Ni3-MoOx/C-400, the higher annealing temperature leads to more metallic Mo being formed in H2 but higher valence states of Mo were formed after exposure to air in Ni3-MoOx/C-500. The proportion of MoO3 (Mo6<sup>+</sup>) of Ni3-MoOx/C-500 even exceeds 52% of total surface Mo atoms. This result is also corroborated by the X-ray diffraction (XRD), where the intensity of the MoO3 (300) peak is strongest in Ni3-MoOx/C-500 compared to other Niy-MoOx/C-T catalysts (Figure S21, Supporting Information).[\[27\]](#page-6-0) This implies that the reconstruction of the Ni–Mo interface in air can be regulated by controlling Mo. Niy-MoOx/C-500 with various Ni/Mo atomic ratios then was explored, and the crystalline degree as well as particle size of Ni particles increased with the Ni/Mo ratios (Figure S21, Supporting Information), which produces different amounts of Ni–Mo interface that influences the catalyze activity.[\[28\]](#page-7-0)

Furthermore, compared with the Ni3-MoOx/C-400, the peak of Mo in Ni3-MoOx/C-500 is shifted to low binding energy, indicating an interfacial electron transfer from Ni to MoOx which further modulates the electronic structure, especially the electrochemical behavior-related valance band. As shown in the ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS), the Ni3-MoOx/C-500 has a higher work function (Φ) of 4.88 eV relative to that of Ni3-MoOx/C-400 (3.98 eV). This means the Ni3-MoOx/C-500 has a higher resistance to oxidation during the catalysis of HOR (**Figure 5**a). Moreover, the Ni d-band center of Ni3-MoOx/C-500 (−1.59 eV), estimated from 0 to 3 eV, significantly downshifted by 0.42 eV as compared to that of Ni3-MoOx/C-400 (−1.17 eV).[\[29–31\]](#page-7-0) The lower d-band center leads to less empty antibonding states above the Fermi level which weakens the adsorption of hydrogen.[\[32\]](#page-7-0) Thus, the enhanced activity of Ni3-MoOx/C-500 can be attributed to the weakened hydrogen binding energy that is regulated by the MoOx-generated interfacial reconstruction. The absorption nearedge structure (XANES) spectra of Ni3-MoOx/C-500 showed a shift to higher energy in the K-edge as compared to that of Ni foil (Figure 5c).[\[33\]](#page-7-0) And the wavelet transformed Ni K-edge Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra show the peak located at 7.1 Å<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> of Ni3-MoOx/C-500, negatively shifted compared to Ni foil (8 Å<sup>−</sup>1), attributed to the Ni─O coordination appeared after reconstruction (Figure 5d). These results further evidenced the metallic state Ni with a relatively high valance state in Ni3- MoOx-500, which weakened the hydrogen binding energy but higher resistance to oxidation.

# **3. Conclusion**

In conclusion, we reported on a potential Ni-based catalyst that passively underwent an interfacial reconstruction exposure to air, which has excellent HOR activity. The mass activity is improved up to a new record of 102.8 A g<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> for HOR, and its catalyzed AEM-FCs output a peak power density of 600 mW cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> in H2/O2. The reconstruction of the Ni–Mo interface can be effectively altered by changing the annealing temperature and Ni/Mo atomic ratio,

Electron Microscopy: The morphology and microstructures of all the catalysts were characterized by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) (JEOL JEM-2100). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution (HR-TEM) images were recorded on a Jem-2100F Jeol electron microscope equipped with a high-brightness field emission gun and an energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analyzer. High-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) measurements were carried out on an FEI Themis Z electron microscope.

X-Ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS): The XAS including X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) of the samples were collected at the Singapore Synchrotron Light Source (SSLS) center, where a pair of channel-cut Si (111) crystals was used in the monochromator. The storage ring was working at the energy of 2.5 GeV with an average electron current of below 200 mA. The acquired Ni K-edge EXAFS data were processed according to the standard procedures using the Athena and Artemis implemented in the IFFFIT software packages. [ $^{34}$ ] Least-squares curve fitting was performed using the Artemis module of IFEFFIT software packages to obtain the quantitative structural parameters. During the fitting, the amplitude reduction factor  $S_0^{\ 2}$  (0.7893) was fixed, while the internal atomic distances R, Debye–Waller factor  $\sigma$ , and the edge-energy shift  $\Delta E_0$  were used as variables.

Ultraviolet Photoelectron Spectroscopy (UPS): Measurements were performed The UV photoelectron spectroscopy data for this experiment were tested by a Thermo Fisher Scientific PHI5000 VersaProbe III device equipped in the same chamber with a He I UV source ( $h\nu = 21.22$  eV), applying a -5.00 eV bias voltage to the sample. The work function ( $\Phi$ ) could be calculated from the following equation:

$$\Phi = h\nu - E_{cutoff} \tag{1}$$

where  $E_{\text{cutoff}}$  is the energy of the secondary-electron cutoff.

The band in the 0 to -3 eV range was attributed to the Ni 3d photoemission.<sup>[29]</sup> The d-band center energy relative to the Fermi level was calculated based on the following equation: <sup>[31,35]</sup>

$$\varepsilon_d = \frac{\int \varepsilon \, n\left(\varepsilon\right) \, d\varepsilon}{\int n\left(\varepsilon\right) \, d\varepsilon} \tag{2}$$

where  $n(\varepsilon)$  is the density of states, and  $\varepsilon$  is the energy of states.

Electrochemical Measurement: All electrochemical experiments were performed at room temperature using a Princeton VersaSTAT 3F electrochemical workstation with a standard three-electrode system consisting of a glassy carbon (GC) as working electrode (5 mm in diameter, PINE: AFE3T050GC), an Ag/AgCl (3 m KCl) as reference electrode, and a graphite rod as counter electrode. The catalyst ink was prepared by dispersion in a mixture of isopropanol (99.5%) and Nafion solution (5 wt%) (concentration of 1 mgNi mL $^{-1}$ ), followed by ultrasonication for 30 min. Then, 10  $\mu$ L of the well-dispersed catalyst ink was deposited to a pre-polished GC disk and dried at room temperature. The commercial 20% Pt/C catalyst was tested as a benchmark catalyst. The Ni loading was 50  $\mu$ g cmdisk $^{-2}$ . In this study, all potentials were given relative to the reversible hydrogen electrode (vs RHE).

Cyclic voltammograms (CVs) for the catalysts were obtained in N<sub>2</sub>- saturated 0.1  $\,\rm M$  KOH at 10  $\,\rm mV$  s $^{-1}$  for 50 cycles. The polarization curve for the HOR was recorded in H<sub>2</sub>-saturated 0.1  $\,\rm M$  KOH at 2  $\,\rm mV$  s $^{-1}$  under a rotation rate of 2500 rpm. The current–time (i–t) chronoamperometry responses were obtained in a 0.1  $\,\rm M$  KOH solution saturated with H<sub>2</sub> containing 1000 ppm CO at 0.1  $\,\rm V$  versus RHE (the rotating speed was 1600 rpm).

The exchange current densities ( $j_0$ ) were determined by the micropolarization region (-6–6 mV) of CVs recorded in H<sub>2</sub>-saturated electrolyte at a sweep rate of 2 mV·s<sup>-1</sup>, then calculated according to the following equation:

$$j = \frac{j_0 F}{RT} \eta \tag{3}$$

leading to an increase in work function, which enhanced the oxi-

dation resistance, and the downshift of the d-band center implied

the weakening of hydrogen adsorption energy, which improved

the HOR activity. This work considers more comprehensively the

effect of air, an easily neglected factor air in the synthesis of Ni-

based catalysts, and effectively utilizes it to enhance the HOR ac-

tivity, providing unique insights into the design of Ni-based elec-

trocatalysts for AEMFC and finding new ways to understand the

Preparation of Catalysts with Different Ni/Mo Atomic Feed Ratios: The Ni $_3$ -MoO $_x$ /C-500 was prepared by a simple solvothermal method. First, 68 mg carbon black (Vulcan XC-72, American Cabot, pretreated in nitric acid at 128 °C for 4 h) was dispersed uniformly in a solution of 18 mL deionized water and 18 mL ethylene glycol by magnetic stirring. Then, 0.1429 mmol (NH $_4$ ) $_6$ Mo $_7$ O $_2$ 4·4H $_2$ O and 3 mmol Ni(NO $_3$ ) $_2$ ·6H $_2$ O (Ni/Mo atomic ratio = 3) were added to the above solution, followed by 600 mg urea. After stirring for 1 h, the obtained suspension was transferred into a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave heated to 120 °C and kept for 8 h. The resulting precipitate was washed with deionized water and ethanol to remove the impurities, and dried in a vacuum at 60 °C for 12 h. Finally, the Ni $_3$ -MoO $_x$ /C-500 was annealed at 500 °C for 2 h with a rate of 5 °C min $_1$  under an atmosphere of H $_2$ :N $_2$  = 10:90 in volume.

For other catalysts with different Ni/Mo atomic ratios, the feeding of  $Ni(NO_3)_2 \cdot 6H_2O$  was kept at 3 mmol, and the feeding of  $(NH_4)_6Mo_7O_{24} \cdot 4H_2O$  was varied so that the Ni/Mo atomic ratios were 1, 2, and 4, respectively. The metal content was guaranteed to be 80% by varying the mass of carbon black (only counting the masses of Ni, Mo, and C).

Preparation of Catalysts with Different Reduction Temperature: The  $Ni_3$ - $MoO_x/C$ -T precursors prepared using the same batch were divided into three portions and subjected to reduction annealing under different temperature conditions. After in situ XPS testing, the catalysts were exposed to air for 2 h and then re-examined for XPS testing.

Materials Physical Characterization—X-Ray Diffraction (XRD): The data were collected with  $2\theta$  ranging from  $10^\circ$  to  $90^\circ$  at a scanning rate of  $10^\circ$  min<sup>-1</sup> on a Rigaku D/MaXIIIA with Cu<sub>kα</sub> ( $\lambda=1.540598$  Å) radiation at 40 kV and 40 mA.

In situ XRD was tested on LabX XRD-6100: SHIMADZU (Shimadzu Corporation) equipped with an electrochemical in situ cell.

X-Ray Photoemission Spectroscopy (XPS): Measurements were performed on a Thermo Fischer ESCALAB 250Xi X-ray photoelectron spectrometer equipped with Al X-ray source (Al K $\alpha$ , 1486.6 eV). The catalyst powder was reduced in N $_2$  containing 10% H $_2$  (v/v) for 2 h at various temperatures. The heat treatment was carried out "in situ" in a chamber connected to the main XPS chamber and the samples were then transferred under vacuum for further analysis. The samples were then exposed to air for 2 h before being tested again.

Spectral analysis and data processing were performed with the software Advantage 5.976. All spectra were subtracted from the Shirley background and calibrated with the C 1s component of 284.8 eV.

*ICP Analysis*: The metal contents in the catalysts were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) (Agilent 720ES(OES)).

<span id="page-6-0"></span>where i is the measured current,  $\eta$  equals E in HOR, F is the Faraday constant (96485 C  $\text{mol}^{-1}$ ), R is the gas constant (8.314 J  $\text{mol}^{-1}$  K<sup>-1</sup>), and T is the temperature in electrochemical test (298.15 K).

The HOR kinetic current (jk) was calculated by fitting the Koutecky-Levich equation to the currents at 50 mV versus RHE at different speeds:

$$\frac{1}{j} = \frac{1}{j_k} + \frac{1}{j_d} = \frac{1}{j_k} + \frac{1}{B\omega^{\frac{1}{2}}c_0} \tag{4}$$

where  $i_d$  is the diffusion-limited current, B is the Levich constant,  $\omega$  is the rotating speed and  $c_0$  is the solubility of  $H_2$  (7.33  $\times$  10<sup>-4</sup> mol L<sup>-1</sup>).

$$B = 0.62nFD^{\frac{2}{3}}v^{-\frac{1}{6}} \tag{5}$$

where n is the number of electron transfers, D is the diffusion coefficient of H<sub>2</sub> (3.7×10<sup>-5</sup> cm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>), and  $\nu$  is the viscosity coefficient.

The accelerated durability test (ADT) was conducted in an H<sub>2</sub>-saturated KOH solution, with CV performed between -0.05 and 0.1 V versus RHE. After reaching a certain number of cycles, LSV curves were obtained at 1600 rpm with a scan rate of 2 mV  $s^{-1}$  after 15 000 and 30 000 cycles,

The Performance of AEMFC Tests: Fuel cell tests were conducted by measuring the polarization curve of MEA with an active area of 1 cm<sup>2</sup>. The mixture of  $Ni_3$ -MoO<sub>x</sub>/C-500 (4 mg cm<sup>-2</sup>) and Vulcan XC-72 (1 mg  $\,\mathrm{cm^{-2}})$  carbon was used as the anode with a1.6  $\mathrm{mg_{Ni}}$   $\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$  loadings and the commercial 60% Pt/C was used as the cathode with a 0.4  $\mathrm{mg_{Pt}}$   $\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$ loading. The catalyst ink was prepared by ultrasonically dispersing the catalyst and ionomer (self-designed quaternary ammonia poly (N-methylpiperidine-co-p-terphenyl)) to water and isopropanol, where the weight ratio of Ionomer to catalyst was 1/5. The anode ink was sprayed on the gas diffusion layer (carbon paper, HCP120), while the cathode ink was sprayed on the membrane (PiperlON A40 Self-Supporting Anion Exchange Membrane, Versogen), then soaked in 1 m KOH at 60 °C for 12 h in order to exchange the anion of the membrane and ionomer to OH-.The AEMFC performance was tested on an 850E fuel cell test station (Scribner). fuel cell operation conditions: cell temperature was 80 °C; gas back pressure on both sides of the cell was 0.2 MPa; fully humidified H<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> were fed at a flow rate of 0.3 and 0.5 L min<sup>-1</sup> respectively; and air was fed at a flow rate of 1 L  $min^{-1}$ .

**In the realm of water electrolysis catalysts, supported platinum-based catalysts have consistently exhibit superior catalytic activity. However, the catalytic mechanisms of platinum species with varying oxidation states, particularly the higher oxidation states, remain elusive. Herein, an UV light induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) strategy is developed to construct uniformly dispersed PtOx nanoclusters on nitrogen-doped hollow carbon spheres (PtOx/NHCS). The in-situ Raman spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the nitrogen-doped carbon matrix optimizes the proton transfer pathways through the adsorption of oxygen-containing species. Additionally, the unique electronic structure of the Pt–O units in the PtOx clusters accelerated the transformation of proton adsorption and desorption capabilities at the active sites. Therefore, the engineered catalyst demonstrates exceptional bifunctionality for hydrogen electrode reactions, delivering HER current density of 10 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> with ultralow overpotentials of 17 mV (alkaline) and18 mV (acidic) while simultaneously achieving superb HOR mass activity of 1345.56 mA mg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> Pt at = 50 mV. Meanwhile, the observed kinetic reciprocity between HER and HOR operations provides compelling evidence for the possibility of the proton transfer mechanism.**

**1. Introduction**

Addressing the escalating issues of environmental pollution and energy scarcity is one of the central themes of the 21st century.[\[1,2\]](#page-15-0) The storage of renewable energy sources, such as wind, solar, and tidal energy, in the form of chemical bonds within chemical fuels presents a viable solution. Hydrogen (H2), characterized by its exceptionally high energy density, can be produced through water electrolysis, enabling a truly carbon-free energy source.[\[3\]](#page-15-0) Platinum-based catalysts currently serve as the cornerstone of industrial catalysis, finding extensive applications in various catalytic processes, including the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR),[\[4\]](#page-15-0) hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR),[\[5\]](#page-15-0) removal of CO and NOx,[\[6\]](#page-15-0) alkane reforming,[\[7\]](#page-15-0) and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).[\[8\]](#page-15-0) Over the past decade, researchers have developed a multitude of non-Pt-based catalysts to facilitate the HER.[\[9–12\]](#page-15-0) However, platinumbased catalysts continue to maintain their unique dominance in the HER. The scarcity of platinum remains an unresolved challenge, highlighting the critical need to explore the intrinsic activity of platinum catalysts to enhance their utilization efficiency.

The enhancement of electrocatalyst activity primarily relies on the kinetic acceleration of the ratedetermining step (RDS) through targeted energy barrier reduction. For proton-coupled hydrogen electrode reactions (such as HER and HOR), the divergent kinetic requirements between

analogous to Pt<sup>0</sup> which correlates with their enhanced HER performance.[\[35–37\]](#page-16-0) Emerging studies further reveal that highvalency Pt species (e.g., Pt–Ox species) display superior intrinsic activity compared to Pt0, attributed to strong electronic coupling with adjacent coordinating atoms.[\[38,39\]](#page-16-0) Nonetheless, the specific catalytic mechanisms governing underlying these behaviors require further elucidation. Moreover, the selection of support material critically determines the performance optimization of Pt-based catalysts. Carbon materials,[\[20,40\]](#page-16-0) transition metal oxides,[\[41,42\]](#page-16-0) metal carbides,[\[43\]](#page-16-0) and metal nitrides have gained prominence owing to their capacity to constrain Pt nanostructure growth via structural defects. These engineered supports create tailored, unique electronic configurations and interfacial characteristics that differentially regulate HER/HOR. A representative case is transition metal oxides, which significantly enhance water adsorption and dissociation through relatively strong electron affinity.[\[44\]](#page-16-0) Recent studies have demonstrated that surface modification of Pt with oxygen-affinic materials, such as Ru adatoms, significantly enhances the structural continuity of the hydrogen bond network, thereby accelerating proton (H<sup>+</sup>) transfer kinetics.[\[45,46\]](#page-16-0) Furthermore, the structural complexity of multicomponent oxides facilitates enhanced H2 desorption kinetics through a hydrogen spillover effect.[\[47\]](#page-16-0) Carbon supports have emerged as the predominant choice for Pt-based catalysts due to their exceptional structural tunability, abundant defect sites, superior electrical conductivity, and remarkable stability under both acidic and alkaline conditions. The strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) between carbon supports and Pt nanoparticles has been shown to significantly enhance the adsorption energy of reaction intermediates on Pt surfaces, consequently improving the catalyst's intrinsic activity.[[48\]](#page-16-0) Notably, carbon constitutes up to 90% of the total catalyst mass. Beyond its critical role in modulating the electronic properties of active sites, carbon also significantly influences hydrogen-involving electrocatalytic processes through the interfacial aqueous microenvironment. Building upon these insights, the strategic design of catalyst architectures enables optimization of proton transfer pathways, effectively facilitating proton migration from the solvent phase across the electrical double layer toward active catalytic sites, thereby achieving substantial enhancement in catalytic performance.

In this work, UV irradiation was ingeniously used to synthesize platinum oxide nanoclusters (PtOx NCs) on nitrogendoped hollow carbon spheres (NHCS), effectively suppressing Pt atoms agglomeration during high temperature synthesis. Through electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and insitu diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS), it is demonstrated the UV-induced generation of ROS on the carbon support surface, which promoted the oxidation of Pt to form PtOx nanoclusters. Crucially, our study revealed that proton transfer dynamics exhibit electron transfer like characteristics, which explains the variations in catalytic activity observed in different solvents due to changes in proton transfer dynamics. Further research has revealed that inherent carbon defects synergistically enhance oxygen-containing species adsorption under pre-HER potentials. This phenomenon is consistent with the construction of oxygen-affinitive metals sites adjacent to Pt centers, collectively optimizing the electric double layer's aqueous microenvironment and proton transfer pathways in 1 M KOH electrolyte.

calculations established that carbon defects are both a prerequisite and sufficient for this interfacial engineering, while PtOx NCs function as dopants to amplify the carbon support's oxygenaffinic properties. The unique Pt-O coordination architecture in PtOx NCs facilitates accelerated electron-proton coupling substantially reducing kinetic barrier. DFT calculations further quantified the progressive increase in hydrogen adsorption free energy  $(\Delta G_{Hx})$  for Pt sites as adjacent oxygen atoms are occupied by H\*, demonstrating PtOx's exceptional hydrogen adsorption/desorption capabilities. Remarkably, the PtOx/NHCS catalyst requires only 17 mV and 18 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> in 1 M KOH and 0.5 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, respectively. Meanwhile, by optimizing proton transfer dynamics, the catalyst demonstrates superior HOR activity, delivering 2.68 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> at 50 mV overpotential. This work not only establishes a novel synthesis method for PtOx catalysts, but also offers new insights into the catalytic mechanisms of Pt-O active centers. Moreover, it clarifies interfacial engineering principles for carbon supports in dynamic regulation strategies of proton-coupled electron transfer processes. The demonstrated synergy between defect engineering and coordination environment optimization opens new avenues for designing high performance electrocatalysts for energy conversion applications.

#### 2. Results and Discussion

NHCS served as the substrate owing to their distinct curved interface. The synthesis pathway of PtOx/NHCS is depicted schematically in Figure 1a. Initially, SiO<sub>2</sub> microspheres were fabricated utilizing a modified Stöber method. Subsequently, SiO<sub>2</sub> (as shown in Figure S1a, Supporting Information) functioned as a hard template for the formation of polypyrrole (Ppy) through a gas-phase polymerization method employing FeCl3 as the initiator (illustrated in Figure S1b, Supporting Information). Following this, NHCS were synthesized via high temperature carbonization at 900 °C in an argon atmosphere for a duration of 3 h, followed by etching with 10 wt.% HF. Platinum nitrate (Pt(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>) was uniformly impregnated onto the NHCS through a wet impregnation technique, and the resultant products were collected via lyophilization. The sample obtained after 9 h of exposure to UV light was designated as PtOx/NHCS. The corresponding Pt content was quantified to be 8.6 wt.% via inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES).

The morphology and structure of the NHCS carbon supports were characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), as illustrated in Figure 1b. The catalyst carriers comprised NHCS with an average diameter of  $345 \pm 16$  nm. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image (Figure 1c) demonstrated that the shell layer of the NHCS exhibited a thickness of  $\approx 10$  nm. This layer was characterized by uniformly distributed pores of varying sizes, which can be attributed to the formation of air cavities during the etching process. High-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images further corroborated that the PtOx nanoclusters (average diameter  $\approx 1.26$  nm) were evenly dispersed across the NHCS, exhibiting a highly uniform size distribution (Figure 1d and inset of Figure 1d). High-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) was conducted for additional material characterization. As shown in Figure S2 (Support-

ing Information), the PtOx nanoclusters (highlighted region) exhibits uniform distribution across the entire surface of the carbon carrier, with a predominant amorphous configuration. The observed lattice fringes correspond to the PtO<sub>2</sub> (011) crystal plane, as evidenced in Figure 1e. HAADF-STEM mapping was subsequently employed to validate the catalyst composition. As illustrated in Figure 1f,j, the mapping results revealed a homogeneous distribution of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and oxygen (O) within the NHCS. Additionally, when combined with Figure \$3 (Supporting Information), the distribution of Pt and O elements exhibits moderate overlap. Furthermore, to achieve higher resolution in characterizing the spatial overlap between the two elements through STEM, larger nanoparticles from the sample were selected for line scanning. As evidenced in Figure S3b (Supporting Information), the characteristic peaks of Pt and O were observed at identical positions, thereby substantiating the spatial overlap between Pt and O.

In recent years, many researchers have attempted to create chemically active defects and increase the number of oxygen-containing functional groups on carbon materials by UV light irradiation. This photogenerated reactive oxygen species also shines in the field of environmental catalysis due to its strong oxidative ability. This research delves deeply into the "photo-oxidation process" and the synthesis mechanism of PtOx, building on earlier research.[49,50] EPR was utilized to verify the generation of reactive oxygen species in the presence of UV light, as illustrated in Figure 2a,b. Notable signals for DMPO-O $_2^{\bullet-}$  (5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide) and TEMP-<sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> (2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidinyl-1-oxide) were detected in the Pt(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>/NHCS system when exposed to UV illumination.<sup>[51]</sup> In the absence of UV illumination, no such signals were observed. Furthermore, the generation of DMPO-O<sub>2</sub> • and TEMP-<sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> was found to be independent of the presence or absence of metal salts, exhibiting consistent phenomena on pure carbon carriers (see Figure \$4, Supporting Information). To further investigate the generation of reactive oxygen species on the catalyst surface and the evolution of the active site PtOx during UV illumination, in-situ DRIFTS spectroscopy was employed to analyze the process. As demonstrated in Figure 2c, the presence of new vibrational peaks, primarily in three distinct wave number bands, was observed following UV irradiation. Among these, the stretching vibration of hydroxyl groups was identified in the range of 3100–3600 cm<sup>-1</sup>. Of particular significance are the new bands that emerged at 1529 and 1731 cm<sup>-1</sup>, corresponding to the asymmetric stretching vibration of (OCO-) and symmetric carbonyl groups (C=O), respectively.[52-54] Furthermore, it was observed that the peak intensity of these species is proportional to the irradiation time. This finding serves to demonstrate that new reactive oxygen species were generated on the surface of NHCS under the irradiation condition of UV light. NHCS containing Pt(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> were examined under identical conditions to the synthesis, resulting in the appearance of the same species in the spectra, as demonstrated in Figure 2d. Notably, the peaks of the same species exhibited a red shift, prompting the hypothesis that the reactive oxygen species generated on the NHCS surface interact with the Pt ions, thereby influencing the position of their vibrational peaks. [55] Furthermore, a comparison analysis of the Xray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) reveals a notable increase in the number of signal peaks attributed to Pt<sup>4+</sup> when Pt(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> is

mixed with NHCS and subsequently subjected to 1 h of UV irradiation (denoted as Pt(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>/NHCS-1 h)·, as shown in Figure 2e. The transition of O species from C=O/C—O (531.9 eV) to M–O (530.7 eV) after 1 h of UV irradiation, as demonstrated in the O 1s XPS spectra (see Figure 2f), provides compelling evidence for oxidation occurring under these conditions. [47.56] The formation of PtOx NCs is further substantiated by DFT calculations. According to DFT results (Figure 2g; Figure S5, Supporting Information), the attachment of the PtOx fragments to the carrier via a

Pt–O bond is thermodynamically favorable ( $E_{\rm convert} = -0.12$  eV). In contrast, attempting to bridge the carrier with a Pt-Pt bond results in an endothermic reaction ( $E_{\rm convert} = +0.26$  eV), making it thermodynamically prohibitive. Based on the aforementioned data, the formation mechanism of PtOx NCs can be deduced as follows: under the influence of UV light (254 nm), the Brownian motion of Pt ions becomes active, leading to the capture of a portion of Pt<sup>2+</sup> by N-deficient sites on NHCS, thereby forming the Pt–N–C structure. Simultaneously, oxygen in the air is activated

and converted into reactive oxygen species (O2 •<sup>−</sup> and 1O2). These reactive oxygen species on the surface of NHCS undergo collisional oxidation with Pt ions, resulting in the formation of PtOx NCs. Eventually, the catalyst PtOx/NCHS, anchored by Pt–N–C sites, gradually evolved into clusters strongly interacting with the carrier through Pt–O bonding. The schematic representation of its synthesis mechanism is depicted in Figure 2h.

In accordance with the synthesis principle outlined above, a systematic investigation was conducted to examine the impact of UV irradiation time on the evolution of PtOx. The PtOx/NHCS-t catalysts (where t denotes the irradiation time) were exposed to UV light for 0, 1, 5, and 15 h, respectively (see Figure S6a–d, Supporting Information). These images indicate that even after longterm ultraviolet light exposure, the size of the PtOx nanoclusters remained within the range of ≈1.30 nm (with an average diameter ranging from 0.97 nm to 1.22 nm), and no obvious aggregation was observed on the surface of the carrier. However, as the exposure time increased, the crystallinity of the particles slightly enhanced, and the measured value of 0.251 nm belonged to the PtO2 (011) crystal plane. Interestingly, the Pt salts that have not been subjected to UV irradiation have already formed clusters, which we believe is due to the abundant defect sites on the carbon support that facilitate a certain degree of self-assembly of the Pt salts. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of PtOx/NHCS-t are illustrated in **Figure 3**[a.](#page-5-0) The broadened diffraction observed near 25° can be attributed to the carbon layer formed by pyrrole polymerization upon carbonization.[\[57\]](#page-16-0) This carbon layer has been demonstrated to enhance catalytic conductivity and corrosion resistance during the electrocatalytic reaction, thereby effectively enhancing the catalyst's reactivity. No any peaks corresponding to Pt (JCPDS 87–0636) or PtO2 (JCPDS 43–1045) were detected in the XRD spectra of the PtOx/NHCS-t catalysts. The findings

are consistent with the earlier TEM characterization results, indicating that Pt elements are uniformly dispersed on the surface of the hollow carbon sphere and form a nanostructure with a size of ≈1.26 nm through the action of UV irradiation. In order to demonstrate the unique superiority of PtOx as a catalyst in the field of electrocatalysis, the Pt/NHCS-T (T representing the metal reduction temperature) was selected as a comparison. As illustrated in Figure 3a, the XRD spectra of Pt/NHCS show clear diffraction peaks at 39°, 46°, 67°, and 81°, which can be attributed to the (111), (200), (220), and (311) diffraction peaks of metallic Pt (JCPDS 87–0636). The XRD results corroborate that during the reduction process at 600 °C, the size of Pt nanoparticles increases significantly while their crystallinity improves, eventually forming an ordered crystal surface. Furthermore, the Pt/NHCS catalysts were also subjected to STEM analysis, as shown in Figure S7 (Supporting Information). In comparison with the nanoclusters in PtOx/NHCS, the NCs were observed to be reduced to Pt particles and undergo significant agglomeration in the Pt/NHCS catalyst, with an approximate diameter of 4.68 nm. The lattice stripes were clearly visible, with a measured width of 0.213 nm, corresponding to the Pt (111) crystal surface (as shown in Figure S7c, Supporting Information). This disparity was attributed to the enhanced reducibility and rapid aggregation of metal oxides at elevated temperatures.

In addition, the unique morphological advantage of NHCS as carriers was demonstrated by preparing lamellar carbon

materials without SiO2 microspheres as hard templates and carbonizing them under identical conditions. These materials were designated as nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) materials. Subsequently, PtOx NCs was loaded using the same method and subjected to a 9 h room temperature photochemical oxidation, marked as PtOx/NC. The TEM image of the PtOx/NC catalysts is shown in Figure S8 (Supporting Information), reveals the presence of PtOx NCs concentrated and adsorbed at the edge of the NC, in contrast to the uniform NCs distribution observed on the NHCS. This can be attributed to the defective curved surface of the carbon material, which facilitates the uniform distribution of the metal species. The structural characteristics of NHCST (T representing the annealing temperature of carbon materials) at different carbonization temperatures were further elucidated by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis. The structural properties of the different NHCS are summarized in Table S1 (Supporting Information). As depicted in Figure S9a (Supporting Information), NHCS exhibited typical type IV adsorption isotherms and H4 adsorption hysteresis loops at all four roasting temperatures, indicating mesoporous structures in the supports.[\[58\]](#page-16-0) The specific surface area of the hollow carbon spheres gradually decreased with increasing roasting temperature, ranging from 244.24 m2g<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> for NHCS700 °<sup>C</sup> to 202.62 m2g<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> for NHCS1000 °C. As demonstrated in Figure S9b (Supporting Information), the pore volume distribution results indicated that the pores of all NHCS concentrated at ≈4 nm, in addition to contributing to a number of mesopores within the wide range of 4–50 nm and a few larger pores sized between 50–80 nm. Concurrently, BET characterization of the carbon layer structure of the prepared NC (illustrated in Figure S10a,b, Supporting Information) manifested type IV adsorption isotherms and H4 isothermal adsorption hysteresis loops, with a specific surface area of only 176.17 m2g<sup>−</sup>1, significantly lower than that of the NHCS. The pore volume distribution was centered ≈4.5 nm. As demonstrated in Figure S9c (Supporting Information), the NHCS exhibited two distinctive characteristic peaks of Raman spectroscopy: the diffraction peak ≈1360 and 1580 cm<sup>−</sup>1, which are attributed to the D band and G band, respectively. The intensity ratio of the D band to the G band is a wellestablished method for quantifying the degree of defects in carbon materials.[\[59\]](#page-16-0) The ID/IG values for NHCS700 °C, NHCS800 °C, NHCS900 °C, and NHCS1000 °<sup>C</sup> were 1.06, 1.04, 0.9, and 0.83, respectively. The results indicate that NHCS1000 °<sup>C</sup> and NHCS900 °<sup>C</sup> exhibit a lower degree of defects compared to NHCS700 °<sup>C</sup> and NHCS800 °C. This suggests that high-temperature conditions promote a higher degree of graphitization in the carbon carrier. This finding is consistent with the BET results, which demonstrate that the presence of an orderly carbon layer can enhance the conductivity of the carbon carrier. Therefore, NHCS900 °<sup>C</sup> not only retains a higher number of defect-anchored metal, but also its higher degree of graphitization ensures electron transport during electrocatalysis.

The electronic structures and valence states of the prepared materials were analyzed through X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). As illustrated in Figure S11 (Supporting Information), the survey spectra of the samples exhibited a series of peaks indicative of the presence of C, N, O, and Pt. The XPS spectra of C 1s and N 1s are illustrated in Figures S12 and S13 (Supporting Information), respectively. Notably, the proportion of O atoms in the catalyst decreased significantly after roasting, as evidenced by a decrease from 8.92% to 4.31% upon normalization of the full spectra of PtOx/NHCS and Pt/NHCS (Figure [3b\)](#page-5-0). Furthermore, the intensity of the M–O signal at 531.48 eV decreased, accompanied by a shift to lower binding energies by 0.61 eV. This suggests that, following annealing, the surface of PtOx/NHCS experiences a substantial loss of oxygen, particularly from the M– O bonding sites. The Pt<sup>0</sup> signals at 70.5 eV and 73.8 eV are exclusively observed in Pt/NHCS, as illustrated in Figure [3c.](#page-5-0) Furthermore, the Pt<sup>4</sup><sup>+</sup> signals at 74.56 eV and 77.76 eV nearly disappear, indicating that the Pt–O bond is cleaved and that PtOx is reduced to Pt particles by carbon following 600 °C treatment. Of particular interest is the shift of the Pt element within the PtOx clusters to a higher binding energy level of ≈+0.65 eV, indicative of an electron-deficient state. In conjunction with the synthesis process illustrated above for PtOx/NHCS obtained by UV treatment, the fitting curve of the Pt XPS spectrum exhibits Pt2<sup>+</sup> and Pt<sup>4</sup><sup>+</sup> species, which derive from the surface-adsorbed Pt(NO3)2, as shown in Figures S14 and S15 (Supporting Information). The results indicate that Pt and O are collisionally bound through reactive oxygen species generated by UV irradiation. The formation of Pt<sup>4</sup><sup>+</sup> and M–O bonds is essentially complete within the first hour, while the redistribution of atomic clusters on the carrier surface requires additional time as these clusters undergo dynamic motions. The subtle distribution of different valence states of Pt species is shown uniformly in Figure [3d.](#page-5-0) Specifically, the proportions of Pt2<sup>+</sup> and Pt<sup>4</sup><sup>+</sup> remain largely unchanged up to 9 h, while the dispersion of PtOx clusters achieves an optimal level at this time point. Based on the XPS results, the presence of oxygen effectively modulates the electronic state of Pt. Compared with Pt nanoparticles, PtOx clusters have stronger metal-carrier interactions with carbon carriers via Pt–O bonds. The rearranged electronic structure not only affects the active center PtOx, but also improves the interfacial environment of the carbon carrier.

To further elucidate the electronic structure and coordination environment of Pt in the catalyst, X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) characterization was conducted. The L-edge normalized X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra of PtOx/NHCS, Pt/NHCS, PtO2, and Pt foil are presented in Figure [3e.](#page-5-0) The intensity of the white-line peaks corresponds to the transfer of the Pt 2p3/2 core-electron to 5d states. Thus, the intensity is used as an indicator of Pt 5d-band occupancy. The white-line intensity of PtOx/NHCS is notably higher than that of Pt/NHCS, suggesting a decrease in 5d occupancy of Pt. This suggests that a reduction in 5d occupancy corresponds to greater charge loss of the Pt atom compared to its initial state, which is consistent with the findings of XRD and XPS analysis.[\[37,60,61\]](#page-16-0) Furthermore, Figure S16 (Supporting Information) presents the first derivative of the normalized L3 edge EXAFS spectra. A detailed comparison reveals that the absorption-edge energies of PtOx/NHCS are more closely aligned with those of PtO2, thereby substantiating the hypothesis that Pt exists in a high-valence state. As demonstrated in Figure [3f](#page-5-0) and Figure S17 (Supporting Information), compared to PtOx/NHCS, the average valence state of Pt in the Pt/NHCS catalyst undergoes a transition from +2.98 to +1.05, indicating a reduction in Pt valence state resulting from the decomposition of Pt–O bonds, as substantiated by XPS analysis. Moreover, the average valence state of Pt in PtOx/NHCS is determined to be +2.98, which corroborates the presence and proportions of Pt<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> and Pt<sup>4</sup><sup>+</sup> species. Further insight into the atomic **[www.advancedsciencenews.com](http://www.advancedsciencenews.com) [www.afm-journal.de](http://www.afm-journal.de)**

coordination environment is obtained through extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) analysis. As demonstrated in Figure [3g](#page-5-0) and Figure S18 (Supporting Information), the characteristic Pt-Pt contribution peak of Pt foil at ≈2.63 Å is not observed for the fabricated PtOx/NHCS, indicating the absence of metallic Pt particles in the sample. Instead, a peak at ≈1.6 Å is observed, indicative of a Pt–O bond, which is consistent with the PtO2 standard substance. To achieve a more precise clarification of the atomic dispersion and coordination of Pt, the wavelet transform (WT) analysis (Figure [3h\)](#page-5-0) was conducted, due to its superior resolution capability in K spaces and radial distance. This analysis enabled the discrimination of atoms with similar coordination conditions and distances. the intensity maxima from the coordination at 1.0 to 2.0 Å in the wavelet transformation are well resolved <sup>≈</sup>6.2 Å<sup>−</sup>1, corresponding to PtO2, and no discernible intensity maximum for the Pt-Pt bond is observed in PtOx/NHCS. Conversely, in Pt/NHCS, a discernible intensity maximum for the Pt-Pt bond is evident, while the Pt–O bond is essentially negligible. In view of these findings, it can be concluded that the PtOx nanostructure is successfully synthesized under the condition of UV irradiation. In contrast, when PtOx/NHCS is subjected to thermal treatment at 600 °C, the PtOx nanostructure is predominantly converted into Pt nanocrystals by carbonization. The residual high-valent Pt species may exist as oxygen species on the surface of Pt nanocrystal or Pt atoms bound to the N/C substrate.

# **3. Theoretical Understanding**

Within electrolyte systems containing diverse cations and anions at varying concentrations, the sustained mobility of hydrogen ions emerges as a pivotal determinant governing the kinetics of the HER. Mechanistically, proton transport is predominantly mediated through H─O─H network interactions, rather than relying on sequential adsorption-desorption cycles of water molecules (i.e., molecular diffusion processes). **Figure [4a](#page-8-0)** schematically depicts this proton transfer mechanism as a coordinated relay process, where proton sequentially traverse from the solvent layer to the electric double layer via H2O/H3O<sup>+</sup> as a transmission medium, ultimately reaching catalytically active adsorption sites. At these interfacial regions, coupled protonelectron transfer occurs, driving hydrogen gas evolution and subsequent phase transformation (gas bubble formation), which collectively complete the desorption sequence. Theoretically, optimizing proton mobility continuity constitutes an essential strategy for overpotential reduction in both HER and HOR. Notably, the characteristics of the solvent microenvironment dictate distinct rate-limiting steps for the HER. In alkaline conditions, the rate-determining step is the proton transfer from the solvent layer to the electric double layer, whereas in acidic conditions, it is the gas-phase nucleation and desorption processes.[\[62\]](#page-16-0) Our analysis could be further extended this conceptual framework to the reverse HOR process, demonstrating concurrent optimization of proton adsorption/desorption energy and hydrogen adsorption/desorption energy. This mechanistic understanding provides critical guidance for developing bifunctional electrocatalysts with enhanced proton flux regulation capabilities, potentially achieving universal applicability across pH conditions. During electrocatalytic reactions, the formation and dynamic response of the double layer at the material-solvent interface occur at a rate that exceeds the kinetics of the actual electrochemical process. The incorporation of oxygen-affinic metallic components into HER catalysts enhances catalytic performance, primarily by improving the continuity of the hydrogen bonding network and optimizing the solvation of alkali metal ions (AM<sup>+</sup>).[\[63–65\]](#page-16-0) However, this mechanistic understanding remains limited to oxygen-affinic metals serving as catalytic carriers, whereas in carbon-supported metal catalysts, the carbon matrix typically constitutes over 90% of the solvent-exposed surfaces and dominates the electric field composition. Consequently, we propose that in carbon-based catalytic systems, the synergistic interaction between carbon supports and oxygen-functionalized moieties under applied overpotentials plays a critical role in reinforcing the structural properties of the solvent layer.

To verify the aforementioned hypothesis, we conducted a comprehensive investigation into the catalytic activity and reaction mechanisms of the synthesized PtOx/NHCS catalyst under both acidic and alkaline conditions. To elucidate the proton transfer process, in-situ Raman spectroscopy studies were performed. At open circuit potential (OCP), the Raman spectrum exclusively displayed characteristic D (1360 cm<sup>−</sup>1) and G (1580 cm<sup>−</sup>1) bands typical of carbonaceous materials. Notably, at −0.5 V versus SHE, two new Raman features emerged at 1130 cm<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> (peak I), and 1520 cm<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> (peak II), with their intensities showing potential-dependent enhancement upon further cathodic polarization (Figure [4b\)](#page-8-0), and these emergent peaks also showed great reversibility. Consistent with prior studies, the emergence of these novel Raman signatures correlates strongly with the intrinsic structural properties of the carbon support rather than heteroatom doping effects.[\[66\]](#page-16-0) This conclusion is supported by control experiments revealing no direct correlation between the observed vibrational modes and the presence of PtOx (Figure S19a, Supporting Information). Complementary in situ Raman analyses of various carbon matrices (XC-72C, graphite; Figure S19b,c, Supporting Information) confirm that the emergence of these spectral features is fundamentally governed by the inherent characteristics of the carbon material. The D-band intensity, widely recognized as a defect-sensitive Raman feature, contrasts with the G-band corresponding to the in-plane E2g vibrational mode of sp2-hybridized carbon at the -point. Comparative analysis of carbon black and graphite spectra (Figure S19d, Supporting Information) indicates that defect density modulation through doping critically influences the formation of this distinctive spectral signature.

Hydrogen/deuterium (H/D) isotopic substitution experiments, as shown in Figure [4c,](#page-8-0) reveal that the 1520 cm<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> Raman peak (Peak II) exhibits a distinct 13 cm<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> red shift (1520→1507 cm<sup>−</sup>1) upon deuteration. This observation unequivocally confirms the essential involvement of hydrogen in this vibrational mode.[\[67\]](#page-16-0) Furthermore, detailed analysis indicates that Peak II arises from vibrational mode splitting at oxygenated amorphous carbon defects, where the adsorption of heavy water (D2O) induces red shifts via hydrogen-bonding interactions. Peak I corresponds to C═O stretching vibrations. Intriguingly, peak I (1130 cm<sup>−</sup>1) exhibited an unexpected blue shift to 1137 cm<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> upon H/D isotopic substitution. This phenomenon is contrary to conventional wisdom as isotopic substitution with heavier deuterium nuclei would normally decrease vibrational frequency,

characteristically producing a red shift instead of the experimentally observed blue shift. This finding implies that the observed spectral feature does not originate from deuterium substitution, but is primarily ascribed to solvent-mediated effects.[\[68\]](#page-16-0) Specifically, the blue shift arises from potential-driven interfacial interactions between D2O molecules and carbon defect sites, mediated through dynamic hydrogen-bonding networks. These observations support the proposed hypothesis that the synergistic interaction between carbon supports and oxygen-functionalized moieties under applied overpotentials governs the emergence of novel Raman features. To elucidate the origins of peaks I and II observed in Raman spectroscopy, this study employed DFT calculations to construct a Raman spectroscopy model for the carbon supports configuration. (Figure 4d).[\[69](#page-16-0)] The theoretical framework incorporates hydroxyl-functionalized graphene fragments (inset, Figure 4d) to simulate oxygenated defect sites of carbon supports. The computational results reveal two emergent vibrational modes (Peak I and Peak II) alongside conventional D and G bands. The spectral characteristics demonstrate remarkable consistency with in-situ Raman observations, validating our hypothesis about carbon's intrinsic properties governing spectral evolution. From a carbon-based perspective, the introduction of metal species can be interpreted as a doping strategy that simultaneously modulates the microstructure and electronic configuration of the carbon supports. DFT calculations (Figure 4e) further confirm that PtOx clusters exhibit higher doping susceptibility compared to their single-atom counterparts (PtSA/NHCS). Notably, the PtOx/NHCS system demonstrates enhanced adsorption capacity for oxygen-containing functional groups (H2O and OH; see the corresponding model in Figure 4f; Figure S20, **[www.advancedsciencenews.com](http://www.advancedsciencenews.com) [www.afm-journal.de](http://www.afm-journal.de)**

Supporting Information), which aligns with the observation of bias-dependent Peaks I and II in PtOx/NHCS at lower potentials relative to Pt/NHCS (Figure S19a, Supporting Information). In summary, the incorporation of PtOx clusters optimizes the electronic structure of the carbon support, significantly strengthening its affinity for oxygenated intermediates. This electronic reconfiguration facilitates the ordered arrangement of water molecules within the electric double layer, thereby promoting efficient proton transfer from the solvent phase to the electric double layer. Such dual optimization mechanisms, specifically electronic restructuring and interfacial proton dynamics, offer a promising strategy for enhancing the catalytic performance of carbon-based materials in alkaline environments.

DFT calculations were conducted to further elucidate the HER mechanism of PtOx/NHCS. To simulate the atomic structure of PtOx/NHCS, a Pt10O12 cluster model was constructed with C/N-Pt–O-Pt configuration anchored on nitrogen-doped carbon surfaces (Figure S21, Supporting Information). Structural optimization (detailed in Supporting Information) confirmed the nanoparticle stabilization through Pt–O bonding on the carbon supports, with structural validity further verified by our prior synthetic mechanism investigations. The charge density difference (Figure S22a, Supporting Information) revealed significant charge accumulation at the PtOx clusters and carbon support interface, demonstrating that SMSI effectively promote electron redistribution. As illustrated in Figure S22b (Supporting Information), further electron localization function (ELF) analysis showed that the delocalized valence electrons of Pt predominantly concentrated around coordinated atom. This electronic configuration generates increased unoccupied states in Pt 5d orbitals, forming an electron structure favorable for catalytic reactions. For active sites, the hydrogen adsorption Gibbs free energy (Δ*G*H\*) remains the most direct descriptor for evaluating catalytic performance. According to the Sabatier principle, when the |Δ*G*H\*| value of active sites approaches zero, it achieves dynamic equilibrium between adsorption and desorption processes, significantly enhancing HER catalytic efficiency. Based on the proposed structural configuration, two distinct hydrogen adsorption sites (Pt and O atoms) were identified. **Figure 5**[a](#page-10-0) illustrates the free energy diagram of PtOx/NHCS across five potential adsorption sites (Pt-1, Pt-2, Pt-3, O-1, O-2), with their atomic positions illustrated in Figure [5b](#page-10-0) and Figure S23 (Supporting Information). Due to pronounced electronic redistribution effects, atoms at varying positions exhibit markedly divergent Δ*G*H\* values, even within the same elemental type. Notably, O atoms demonstrate a very low Δ*G*H\*, indicating them as efficient proton reservoirs during the HER. In contrast, adjacent Pt atoms display elevated Δ*G*H\*, which can be ascribed to their unoccupied 5d orbitals. These orbitals function as electron-accepting centers under applied overpotential, thereby facilitating efficient electron transfer. The synergistic Pt–O interactions thereby enhance electronproton coupling kinetics, facilitating formation of the optimal H\* pathway. Therefore, exploring the adsorption mechanisms of hydrogen species at multiple active sites remains imperative for a comprehensive understanding. As shown in Figure S24 (Supporting Information), O atoms at the Pt-2 coordination site exhibit preferential hydrogen adsorption due to their strong binding affinity. Systematic evaluation of H\* occupation at O-1 and O-2 sites reveals a progressive optimization of Δ*G*H\* at the adjacent Pt-2 site (Figure [5c\)](#page-10-0), decreasing from −0.34 eV to −0.11 eV upon H\* saturation. This modulation arises from enhanced electron density redistribution around Pt atoms when oxygen sites in Pt–O–Pt units are hydrogen-occupied, effectively tuning the H\* adsorption energy to better align with the desired HER characteristics. To validate the generality of this phenomenon, we investigated the correlation between hydrogen occupation at distinct atomic positions and Δ*G*H\* modulation in neighboring atoms. Significantly, analogous behavior was observed across multiple sites within PtOx clusters (Figure S25, Supporting Information). This optimization mechanism can be attributed to substantial orbital overlap between Pt and O atoms. The occupation of oxygen sites by H\* induces electronic restructuring that effectively enhances the adsorption energetics for secondary H\* on adjacent Pt atoms or bridging oxygen sites.

In contrast, calculations for the platinum single-atom catalyst (PtSA/NHCS) and platinum nanoparticle catalyst (Pt/NHCS) are presented in Figures S26 and S27 (Supporting Information), respectively. As illustrated in Figure [5d,](#page-10-0) the Δ*G*H\* values for PtSA/NHCS escalate from −0.03 eV to +1.51 eV during sequential adsorption of three hydrogen atoms, revealing fundamental limitations in accommodating multiple hydrogen adatoms due to combined orbital saturation effects and steric hindrance. Conversely, Pt/NHCS exhibits stable hydrogen adsorption free energy regardless of hydrogen coverage levels, corroborating extensive literature reports on platinum nanoparticles' superior hydrogen adsorption capacity coupled with inherent desorption limitations. These comparative results highlight the critical role of Pt–O units in PtOx/NHCS under high H\* coverage conditions for HER optimization. The self-regulating adsorption energy mechanism of PtOx clusters facilitates robust hydrogen binding at vacant sites while dynamically reducing adsorption strength under high H\* coverage, thereby enabling efficient desorption. This dynamic regulatory mechanism facilitates H<sup>+</sup> adsorption via Pt–O unit, where the synergistic interplay between platinum and oxygen substantially enhances the HER kinetics. Figure [5e](#page-10-0) and Figure S28 (Supporting Information) present the charge density difference maps and bader charge analysis (Figure S29 and Table S2, Supporting Information) for H\*-adsorbed PtOx/NHCS, showing a 0.27 eV electron transfer from the catalyst to adsorbed H\*, indicative of strong catalyst- H\* interactions. Complementary partial density of states (PDOS) analysis (Figure S30, Supporting Information) demonstrates that O 2p and Pt 5d orbitals hybridization induces pronounced band restructuring, enhancing electronic state delocalization below the Fermi level. This evidence confirms the formation of stable Pt–O chemical bonds whose electronic configuration becomes modulated by hydrogen occupation on oxygen sites. Simultaneously, based on symmetry-matching principle and PDOS analysis (Figure [5f](#page-10-0) and [g\)](#page-10-0), we establish the orbital origins of chemical bonding that Pt-H bonding arises from the interaction between 5dyz (Pt) and 1s (H) orbitals, while O-H bonding originates from the hybridization of 2p (O) and 1s (H) orbitals. The d-band center evolution is analyzed to explore hydrogen coverage effects on adsorption energy at the Pt-2 site. As revealed in Figure S31 (Supporting Information), hydrogen occupation at adjacent O-2 site induces a notable downshift in the Pt d-band center from −2.77 eV (pristine PtOx) to −2.93 eV, correlating with diminished hydrogen adsorption capability at Pt-2 site. Detailed

examination of Pt 5d orbital splitting under varying hydrogen coverage (Figure 5h) reveals a progressive weakening of Pt-H interactions. Specifically, as the neighboring O-1 and O-2 sites become increasingly hydrogen-occupied, the d-band position exhibits a gradual downshift from −1.75 to−2.45 eV. This electronic modulation originates from the orbital hybridization dynamics, wherein the coupling between H 1s and Pt 5d orbitals induces energy level splitting into bonding and antibonding states. Crucially, hydrogen occupation at adjacent oxygen sites drives antibonding states closer to the Fermi level, increasing antibonding state occupancy and consequently weakening Pt-H bonding strength. The interaction mechanism is schematically depicted in Figure 5i, illustrating the generation of localized bonding and antibonding states through the hybridization of H 1s with Pt 5d orbitals. The relative stabilization of antibonding states provides direct theoretical evidence for coverage-dependent adsorption strength reduction.

Collectively, these findings demonstrate the pivotal roles of Pt– O units and carbon supports within the PtOx/NHCS architecture in mediating the HER. The reaction kinetics are fundamentally governed by H<sup>+</sup> transfer dynamics and adsorption energetics, regardless of whether in acidic or alkaline operating environment. Notably, alkaline conditions introduce additional kinetic barriers through alkaline metal cation interference with proton transport pathways. The strategic incorporation of oxyphilic metals enhances the HER activity by optimizing the adsorption of oxygencontaining species and reconfiguring the hydrogen-bonding network within the electrochemical double layer, thereby facilitating efficient proton transfer mechanisms. This principle is also applicable to defect-engineered carbon supports, where the applied potentials restructure the hydrogen-bonding networks in the solvent layer, facilitating directional H<sup>+</sup> migration toward active adsorption sites. Mechanistically, Pt–O units enhance the kinetics of electron-proton coupling during the HER and enable dynamic

# **4. Electrocatalytic Performance and Mechanism Verification**

Driven by the need to verify the reliability of theoretical calculations, a series of electrocatalytic performance characterization experiments were systematically conducted to evaluate the catalyst samples. The PtOx/NHCS catalyst demonstrated exceptional hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance in 1 M KOH electrolyte, as evaluated through a standardized three-electrode system. As depicted in **Figure 6**a, comparative analysis with commercial 20 wt.% Pt/C revealed a remarkably low overpotential (<sup>10</sup> = 17 mV at 10 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2), outperforming both Pt/C (35 mV) and Pt/NHCS (30 mV). Notably, PtOx/NC exhibited substantially inferior activity (<sup>10</sup> = 213 mV), primarily attributed to its reduced specific surface area (SBET = 176.17 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>−</sup>1) compared to NHCS (SBET = 212.94 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>−</sup>1), which critically affects precursor dispersion and PtOx clusters distribution (Figure S8, Supporting Information). Structural limitations including the absence of hollow curvature further exacerbated metal precursor loss during lyophilization, ultimately diminishing precious metal utilization efficiency. Mass activity is another significant criterion for evaluating the utilization of precious metal catalysts. As demonstrated in Figure 6b, mass activity analysis normalized to platinum loading revealed PtOx/NHCS's superior catalytic efficiency (2.73 A mg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> Pt), surpassing Pt/NHCS (2.08 A mg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> Pt) and quadrupling Pt/C's performance (0.68 A mg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> Pt). The enhanced atomic utilization stems from abundant Pt–O active sites in photochemically synthesized nanoclusters. Systematic investigation of irradiation duration demonstrated optimal HER activity at 9 h (<sup>10</sup> = 17 mV), with prolonged exposure beyond 15 h yielding no incremental benefits (Figure S32, Supporting Information). In addition, the impact of the carbon carrier calcination temperature on catalytic performance was systematically evaluated through electrochemical activity measurements (Figure S33, Supporting Information). HER activity exhibited a volcano-shaped dependence on carrier calcination temperature, peaking at 900 °C before **[www.advancedsciencenews.com](http://www.advancedsciencenews.com) [www.afm-journal.de](http://www.afm-journal.de)**

declining at higher temperatures. Specifically, PtOx/NHCS700 °C, PtOx/NHCS800 °C, and PtOx/NHCS1000 °<sup>C</sup> demonstrated overpotentials of 75, 32, and 28 mV, respectively, at 10 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2. These findings corroborate that both the graphitization degree and spatial distribution of defect sites critically govern electrocatalytic efficiency. Concurrently, elevated reduction temperatures for PtOx/NHCS promoted Pt nanoparticle coalescence, leading to progressive attenuation of intrinsic activity in Pt/NHCS-T catalysts (Figure S34, Supporting Information). Tafel slopes analysis was systematically conducted to elucidate the HER mechanism of the electrocatalysts. As depicted in Figure [6c,](#page-11-0) the for PtOx/NHCS exhibited a Tafel slope of 33 mV dec<sup>−</sup>1, comparable to that of commercial Pt/C, confirming its adherence to the Volmer-Tafel reaction pathway. The combined advantages of low overpotential and favorable Tafel slope position PtOx/NHCS as a superior HER catalyst in 1 M KOH electrolyte, outperforming most reported Pt-based catalysts (Figure [6d;](#page-11-0) Table S3, Supporting Information). Electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) characterization via cyclic voltammetry (CV) in 1 M KOH (Figure S35, Supporting Information) demonstrated that PtOx/NHCS exhibits a significantly higher double-layer capacitance (Cdl) of 16.9 mF cm<sup>−</sup>2, which is 52% greater than that of Pt/C (11.1 mF cm<sup>−</sup>2) and 34% higher than Pt/NHCS (12.6 mF cm<sup>−</sup>2), as illustrated in Figure S36a (Supporting Information). This enhanced Cdl is directly proportional to the increased ECSA, indicating that PtOx clusters offer superior exposure of active sites compared to conventionally calcined Pt nanoparticles. Complementary electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements in alkaline media demonstrated exceptional charge transfer characteristics for PtOx/NHCS, as evidenced by its minimal charge transfer resistance (Rct) (Figure S36b, Supporting Information). This low Rct indicates highly efficient interfacial charge transfer kinetics at the catalyst-electrolyte interface. The stability of the catalysts was systematically evaluated through CV testing in 1 M KOH (Figure S37a, Supporting Information). Accelerated durability testing involving 5000 CV cycles revealed exceptional stability, with the overpotential at 10 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> showing a negligible increase of 2 mV. Even under demanding operational conditions (100 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2), the overpotential exhibited minimal degradation of 10 mV. Complementary chronoamperometric (i-t) testing demonstrated stable current retention over 50 h of continuous operation (Figure S37b, Supporting Information). Notably, PtOx/NHCS demonstrated markedly superior stability compared to commercial Pt/C, with stability metrics exceeding conventional benchmarks. These comprehensive stability evaluations confirm the exceptional durability of the PtOx/NHCS catalyst under harsh alkaline operating conditions.

In addition, the unique electronic configuration of Pt–O active centers in the PtOx/NHCS catalyst exhibited excellent performance under acidic conditions. To investigate the formation mechanism of these Pt–O active sites, the HER catalytic activity of synthesized samples was systematically evaluated using a three-electrode setup in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution (see Supplementary Information for experimental details). As demonstrated in Figure [6e,](#page-11-0) PtOx/NHCS outperforms both commercial Pt/C and Pt/NHCS counterparts, achieving a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> at an exceptionally low overpotential of 18 mV. This superior performance highlights the Pt–O bond as a highly promising active center for HER catalysis. Comparative samples under identical conditions are illustrated in the inset of Figure [6e.](#page-11-0) Mass activity analysis (calculated from LSV data and Pt loadings) further confirms the superiority of Pt–O centers. As demonstrated in Figure [6f,](#page-11-0) PtOx/NHCS achieves a mass activity of 28 mV, which is significantly lower than that of Pt/NHCS (43 mV) and Pt/C (82 mV) with the current density of 1 A cm<sup>−</sup>2. Furthermore, turnover frequency (TOF) analysis, presented in Figure S41 (methodology detailed in Figure S42, Supporting Information), quantitatively confirms this advantage, revealing that PtOx/NHCS achieves TOF values corresponding to overpotential of 50 mV, which is 25 times higher than that of commercial Pt/C. Thereby providing conclusive evidence for the pivotal role of Pt–O species in achieving optimal catalytic activity under acidic conditions. Kinetic analysis based on Tafel slopes offers deeper insights into the reaction mechanisms. PtOx/NHCS exhibits an exceptionally low Tafel slope of 12.31 mV dec<sup>−</sup>1, which is significantly lower than those of Pt/C (27.04 mV dec<sup>−</sup>1) and Pt/NHCS (27.34 mV dec<sup>−</sup>1), indicating more favorable reaction kinetics that align with the Volmer-Tafel mechanism (Figure [6g\)](#page-11-0). To assess the effective activity of individual sites, ECSA-normalized specific activity was determined via hydrogen underpotential deposition (HUPD) analysis. Despite possessing a lower ECSA of 28.98 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>−</sup>1Pt compared to Pt/NHCS (48.17 m2 g<sup>−</sup>1Pt) and Pt/C (50.61 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>−</sup>1Pt) (Figure S43a, Supporting Information), PtOx/NHCS demonstrates a 26-fold enhancement in specific activity relative to Pt/C at 50 mV (Figure S43b, Supporting Information), thereby confirming its superior intrinsic catalytic efficiency. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), as depicted in Figure S44 (Supporting Information), demonstrates the minimal charge transfer resistance of PtOx/NHCS, evidenced by the smallest semicircle diameter in the Nyquist plots. This finding corroborates the rapid kinetics of HER for PtOx/NHCS. To address the stability concerns commonly associated with metal oxides in acidic HER environments, accelerated degradation tests (ADT) involving 5000 cyclic voltammetry (CV) cycles were conducted. The results revealed negligible performance degradation, with <sup>10</sup> increasing by only 5 mV and <sup>100</sup> by 19 mV (Figure S45a,Supporting Information). Furthermore, long-term stability testing under constant current operation for 100 h demonstrated an insignificant overpotential increase of less than 5 mV at 10 (Figure S45b Supporting Information), thereby confirming the exceptional durability of PtOx/NHCS. The combination of exceptional mass activity, low overpotential, rapid kinetics, and outstanding stability positions Pt–O active centers in PtOx/NHCS as a breakthrough catalyst system for acidic HER applications. The pH-dependent HER reaction mechanism hypothesis received substantial experimental validation through systematic kinetic investigations. As demonstrated in Figure S46a,b (Supporting Information), the PtOx/NHCS catalyst demonstrates a reaction order of 1.59, closely approaching the theoretical value of 2 for ideal Tafel-step dominated processes. Operando CV analysis revealed critical insights into hydrogen desorption dynamics, with the variation of characteristic peak in the double layer region being monitored across varying scan rates (Figure S47, Supporting Information). The construction of potential-scan rate correlation plots enabled quantitative assessment of hydrogen desorption kinetics, where PtOx/NHCS exhibited remarkable potential invariance under scan rate modulation (Figure S48, Supporting Information). This behavior is in excellent agreement with the

previous theoretical calculation results (Figure 5c,d). Comparative analysis with Pt/NHCS and Pt/C controls revealed that the Pt–O active centers effectively reduce hydrogen desorption activation energy. This distinct behavior confirms the critical role of Pt–O sites in accelerating the hydrogen desorption step. Complementary operando EIS studies employing a double-parallel equivalent circuit model (Figure S49a, Supporting Information) provided mechanistic insights into adsorption kinetics. The derived Tafel slope of 36.6 mV·dec<sup>-1</sup> from logR2-overpotential plots (Figure S49b, Supporting Information) not only confirms the Volmer-Tafel pathway dominance but also reveals enhanced electron-proton coupling efficiency through Pt–O mediated charge transfer optimization. The HER activity of PtOx/NHCS is superior to that of previously reported Pt-based catalysts (Figure 6h; Table S4, Supporting Information).

To thoroughly validate the theoretical feasibility of the reverse proton transfer mechanism, this study evaluated the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) performance of catalysts in a H<sub>2</sub>-saturated 0.1 M KOH electrolyte using a rotating disk electrode (RDE) system. As shown in Figure 6i, Electrochemical tests revealed that the LSV curve of the PtOx/NHCS catalyst rapidly reached the limiting current plateau with increasing potential, achieving a current density 2.68 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> at a 50 mV overpotential. This value reflects an 88.7% enhancement compared to conventional Pt/C catalysts (1.42 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>), thereby highlighting the superior HOR catalytic performance of the PtOx/NHCS catalyst. As a control experiment, in the N<sub>2</sub>saturated 0.1 M KOH electrolyte (green curve of Figure \$50, Supporting Information), no significant oxidation current was observed for PtOx/NHCS, confirming that its current response originates from the HOR process. Polarization curves collected at various rotation rates (Figure 6j; Figure S51, Supporting Information) were employed to construct the Koutecky–Levich plot (inset of Figure 6j), depicting the reciprocal current density versus the square root of rotation rate at 50 mV versus RHE. The experimentally obtained slope of 4.61  $\text{cm}^2 \cdot \text{mA}^{-1} \cdot \text{s}^{-1/2}$  exhibited close agreement with the theoretical value (4.87 cm<sup>2</sup>·mA<sup>-1</sup>·s<sup>-1/2</sup>) for the two-electron transfer HOR, thereby confirming the dominance of the two-electron pathway. Further analysis using the Koutecky-Levich equation revealed (Figure 6k) a kinetic current density (j<sub>k</sub>) of 41.92 mA·cm<sup>-2</sup> for PtOx/NHCS at 50 mV, significantly higher than that of Pt/NHCS (4.14 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>) and Pt/C (3.21 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>). Analysis of the micro-polarization region (-5 to +5 mV, Figure 61) revealed that the PtOx/NHCS catalyst exhibited an exchange current density (j<sub>0</sub>) of 2.91 mA·cm<sup>-2</sup>, being 2.22 and 2.82-fold higher than those of Pt/NHCS (1.31 mA·cm<sup>-2</sup>) and Pt/C (1.03 mA·cm<sup>-2</sup>), respectively. Correspondingly, PtOx/NHCS exhibits the lowest charge transfer resistance at 50 mV overpotential (Figure S52, Supporting Information). Upon platinum loading normalization (Figure S53, Supporting Information), the PtOx/NHCS demonstrated mass-specific kinetic current density (j<sub>k,m</sub>) and exchange current density (j<sub>0,m</sub>) of 1345.56 mA·mg<sup>-1</sup>Pt and 93.66 mA·mg<sup>-1</sup>Pt, respectively, corresponding to 30.6-fold and 6.5-fold enhancements over Pt/C, thereby highlighting its exceptional platinum atom utilization efficiency. This study proposes an innovative concept that the ratedetermining factors of hydrogen electrode reactions across different aqueous environments can be unified as proton migration efficiency.

Theoretical calculations and characterization results jointly support the judgment that the Pt-O bond serves as a potential active center for enhancing the efficiency of hydrogen electrode reactions of Pt-based catalysts. Interestingly, the hydrogen adsorption free energy of Pt shows dynamic changes with the increase in hydrogen coverage. To further understand its active sites, the dynamic changes of PtOx/NHCS was further investigated during the reaction process. The catalyst was coated on a 1 cm<sup>2</sup> carbon paper for chronoamperometric tests at an overpotential of -25 mV to obtain the crystal structure of the catalyst after the reaction. As shown in Figure \$54 (Supporting Information), compared with the clean carbon paper, no obvious diffraction peaks belonging to any Pt species were observed in either 1 M KOH or 0.5 H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> after running for 48 h. To gain a clearer understanding of the structural evolution of PtOx nanoclusters after the reaction, HRTEM analyses were conducted following the chronoamperometric testing of the catalyst in 1 M KOH and 0.5 H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> (overpotential = -25 mV), as well as 4000 cycles of cyclic voltammetry scans within a potential window of -25 to -125 mV. As shown in Figures \$55 and \$56 (Supporting Information), PtOx nanoclusters exhibited a certain degree of agglomeration after prolonged chronoamperometric testing or extensive cyclic voltammetry scans. However, their particle size still remained within 5 nm. The particle agglomeration phenomenon was effectively suppressed in acidic media, a consequence of the substantially reduced working potential in acidic environments relative to alkaline electrochemical conditions. These findings validate the superior chemical stability of PtOx nanoclusters in acidic systems. Notably, the lattice fingerprint analysis of the nanoparticles revealed interplanar distances closely matching those of the Pt<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (210) plane and Pt (111) plane. This structural evolution is due to the oxygen desorption occurring in PtOx during the hydrogen evolution process, which accounts for the observed decline decrease in stability test performance.

To obtain a more accurate understanding of the dynamic changes of Pt species during the reaction process, the coordination environment of Pt species was revealed through operando XAFS at different potentials. As shown in the XANES spectra (Figure 7a), PtOx/NHCS exhibited a high intensity of the white line peak at open-circuit voltage, indicating a high oxidation state due to the large number of Pt–O bonds in PtOx/NHCS. However, after applying the hydrogen evolution reduction potential, the intensity of the white line peak of PtOx/NHCS-dp (different potential) decreased significantly, yet remains higher than that of the Pt foil. These findings were consistent with the XPS (Figure S57, Supporting Information) results, which revealed that the binding energy of Pt 4f orbitals follows the sequence: PtOx/NHCS > PtOx/NHCS-dp > Pt/NHCS, indicating a progressive increase in the catalyst's electron cloud density across these three samples (PtOx/NHCS < PtOx/NHCS-dp < Pt/NHCS). Notably, as depicted in Figure \$58 (Supporting Information), the structural reconfiguration of PtOx proceeds rapidly and stabilizes, maintaining its coordination architecture essentially invariant with increasing overpotential (-25 to -225 mV) and prolonged reaction duration. Figure 7b demonstrated that PtOx/NHCS mainly exhibited characteristic Pt-O bonding at 1.7 Å, corresponding to the crystalline phase of PtO<sub>2</sub>. Upon application of hydrogen evolution overpotential, a broad scattering feature emerged between 1.2 and 2.9 Å, indicating the coexistence of Pt–O and Pt-Pt shells

structure. The WT analysis of EXAFS further provided a more intuitive result for the coordination structure of PtOx/NHCS. As shown in Figure 7c, at open-circuit voltage, PtOx/NHCS under open-circuit conditions exhibited a distinct coordination feature with dominant Pt–O bonding at 1–4 Å. Upon applying hydrogen evolution reduction potentials, the oxygen atoms in the PtOx nanoclusters undergone progressive dissociation, leading to a reduction in Pt–O bonding and a concurrent increase in Pt–Pt metallic bonding. Notably, the K and R values associated with Pt-Pt bonding in PtOx/NHCS-dp exhibited distinct deviations from those observed in Pt foil, with characteristic lobe shifted toward lower R and K values directly correlated to the presence of coordinated O atoms within the PtOx nanoclusters. Clearly, the Pt atoms in PtOx clusters demonstrate dual metallic and oxidic characteristics, as evidenced by coordination analysis. In the PtOx/NHCS catalyst, the PtOx nanoclusters undergo potential-dependent oxygen dissociation at the hydrogen evolution conditions, wherein the residual Pt–O bonding induces a gradient oxidation state in Pt centers. This structural evolution elucidates the origin of the dynamic modulation in Pt's hydrogen adsorption free energy, with the adsorbed oxygen species functioning as structurally active "dissociation" sites that regulate the redox behavior of the nanoclusters. Furthermore, the oxidation state gradient induced by Pt–O bonding exhibits superior hydrogen desorption and adsorption capabilities. Consequently, it is be believed that the Pt–O active sites greatly enhance the electrocatalytic activity of PtOx toward hydrogen electrode reaction. Mechanistic studies (as shown in Figure 7d) demonstrate that the dynamic optimization of Pt–O active sites in PtOx/NHCS achieves dual effects: promoting directional proton transfer from the solvation layer to the electrical double layer, while concurrently modulating hydrogen adsorption/desorption energy barriers to improve reaction reversibility. This synergistic mechanism confers the catalyst with outstanding hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) performance across a broad pH range (0–14), along with excellent reversible characteristics, thus establishing a robust theoretical foundation for designing highly efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts.

### 5. Conclusion

In summary, this study achieved uniform deposition of PtOx NCs containing Pt-O structural units onto an N-doped hollow carbon shell through an UV irradiation strategy, endowing the catalyst with exceptional bifunctional catalytic performance for both HER and HOR in alkaline and acidic media. EPR and insitu DRIFTS analyses confirmed that UV irradiation induced the generation of reactive oxygen species on the carbon support surface, which facilitated the oxidation of metallic Pt into highly dispersed PtOx NCs. XPS and XAS characterizations demonstrated that Pt species in PtOx exists in a high oxidation state of +2.98 eV. which is attributed to the pronounced electronic coupling effects between Pt-O bonds. This kind of electronic coupling further enhances the electronic modulation between Pt-O bonds and the carbon support. The PtOx/NHCS catalyst exhibited remarkable pH-universal performance, requiring only 17 mV overpotential to achieve 10 mA·cm<sup>-2</sup> HER current density in 1 M KOH with a mass activity of 2.73 A·mg<sup>-1</sup> Pt (4-fold enhancement over commercial Pt/C), while demonstrating 25-fold higher TOF value than Pt/C in 0.5 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>. DFT calculations elucidated that Pt-O units dynamically modulate  $\Delta G_{H*}$ , showing gradual evolution with H\* coverage on oxygen sites, which significantly reduced the kinetic barrier for hydrogen adsorption/desorption. Operando XAFS confirmed the presence of both Pt-Pt and Pt-O bonds at the hydrogen evolution potential. The Pt-O units in PtOx enabled a gradient valence state change in Pt, which optimized the adsorption and desorption of hydrogen simultaneously. This unique electronic configuration, synergized with the proton transport pathways optimized by the nitrogen-doped carbon supports, enabled outstanding HOR performance with 2.68 mA⋅cm<sup>-2</sup> current density and 1345.56 mA·mg<sup>-1</sup> Pt mass activity at 50 mV overpotential. Based on the aforementioned results, proton transfer efficiency has been rationally identified as one of the critical determinants governing hydrogen electrode reactions, where the solventdependent bidirectional proton transport between the solvent layer and active sites directly determines the reaction kinetics of hydrogen electrode processes. The hydrogen electrode reactions exhibit reversible proton transport characteristics, where the solvation layer delivers sustained proton flux to the electrical double layer, while electronically optimized active sites facilitate highefficiency bidirectional conversion between protons and hydrogen. This innovative approach for designing high-performance bifunctional electrocatalysts is achieved through the synergistic optimization of proton transport networks and interfacial chargetransfer kinetics.

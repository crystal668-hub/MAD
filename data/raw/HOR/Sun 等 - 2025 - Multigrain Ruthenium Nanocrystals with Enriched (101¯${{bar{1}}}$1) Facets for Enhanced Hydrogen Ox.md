Ruthenium-based materials are promising alternatives to expensive platinum for the anodic hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) in anion exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs), but face stability issues due to the strong oxophilicity. Here, an oxidation-resistant ruthenium multigrain catalyst is reported that exposes rich (1011) facets for high-performing HOR catalysis in alkaline electrolytes. The catalyst exhibits a high kinetic current density of 61 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> at an overpotential of 50 mV, which is 25.6- and 7.8-times higher than that of commercial ruthenium-carbon and platinum-carbon catalysts, respectively. Moreover, it also demonstrates a wide stability window up to 0.3 V versus the reverse hydrogen electrode and enhanced tolerance to carbon monoxide. An AEMFC containing this catalyst at the anode achieves peak power densities of 1.31 and 1.06 W cm<sup>-2</sup> under hydrogen-oxygen and hydrogen-air conditions at 90 °C, respectively, and operates steadily. Experimental and theoretical studies reveal that the (1011) facet possesses a higher oxidation barrier and lower hydrogen oxidation barrier than the common (0002) facets, enabling the exceptional HOR performances in alkali.

1. Introduction

Given its high efficiency and water-only emission, the hydrogenoxygen fuel cell has been considered a promising energy conversion technology with great potential for achieving carbon neutrality.[1,2] In recent years, rapid advancements in anion exchange membranes[3] and nonprecious metal catalysts for the cathode oxygen reduction reaction[4-6] have made the anion-exchange-membrane fuel cell (AEMFC) a more economical and sustainable power source as compared to the mature proton-exchange-membrane fuel cells.[7-9] However, the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) performance at the anode of AEMFC remains insufficient, even on platinum (Pt)-group metals (e.g., Pt, iridium, and palladium), due to its sluggish kinetics in alkaline media. Compared to acidic conditions, achieving the desired catalytic activity under alkaline environments requires a substantial increase in precious metal loading, leading to significantly higher costs.[10,11] While non-precious HOR catalysts, primarily

based on nickel,<sup>[12-15]</sup> have developed considerably, their inadequate efficiency and durability remain major challenges.<sup>[16]</sup> Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop cost-effective Ptfree HOR catalysts with high performance for AEMFCs.

Less expensive ruthenium (Ru) has been thought a promising and economical alternative to Pt for HOR due to its similar hydrogen binding energy to Pt and its reasonable oxyphilic ability.[17] Extensive efforts have been dedicated to developing highly active Ru-based alkaline HOR catalysts, such as boron/phosphorus doped Ru, ref. [18,19] Mo-modified Ru nanosheet,[20] Ru colloidosome,[21] and various Ru-alloys,[22,23] However, Ru-based catalysts often tend to degrade rapidly above ≈0.1 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE, unless otherwise stated, all potentials reported are versus RHE) due to the surface oxidation.[24,25] In an AEMFC stack, a single cell with a low deactivation anode overpotential can cause a significantly elevated anode potential and the rapid degradation of the entire stack. [26] Thus, HOR catalysts demand a broader working potential window (up to 0.3 V) to maintain substantial power output.<sup>[27]</sup> Previous research has shown that the hexagonal phase Ru (h-Ru) exhibits a 63 mV broader HOR working potential range (0 to 160 mV) compared to the cubic phase (0 to 97 mV), [28] which was attributed to the presence of (1011) surface that bears an oxygen-tolerant property.<sup>[29]</sup> Unfortunately, because of the Wulff shape construction, (0001) facet of h-Ru is the most stable and exposed surface, making the formation of (1011) facet a big challenge. [30,31] These early findings motivate us to stabilize the Ru ( $10\overline{1}1$ ) facet and further explore the facet effects on the performance of Ru catalysts for HOR in alkaline media.

Herein, we report the synthesis of an open-structured Ru nanocage composed of numerous h-Ru nanograins (termed Ru NGs). These Ru NGs ( $\approx 3.5\,$  nm) feature abundant conjunction facets between ( $10\bar{1}1$ ) and (0002) surfaces and show a high current density of 61 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> at 50 mV for alkaline HOR, 25.6- and 7.8-fold that of commercial Ru/C and Pt/C catalysts, respectively. This catalyst also possesses a wide operating window up to 0.3 V and improved tolerance to carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning. An AEMFC integrated with this catalyst at the anode achieves a peak power density of 1.31 W cm<sup>-2</sup> in hydrogen-oxygen ( $H_2/O_2$ ) and 1.06 W cm<sup>-2</sup> in  $H_2$ /air conditions at 90 °C. Structural and computational results disclose that the  $H_2$  thermal treatment process induces the formation of ( $10\bar{1}1$ ) facets on Ru NGs, which lead to a greatly increased oxidation barrier and contribute to the enhanced HOR energetics.

## 2. Results and Discussion

## 2.1. Synthesis and Characterization of Ru NGs

The open-structured Ru nanocage with abundant nanograins was synthesized through a three-step strategy as illustrated in Figure S1 (Supporting Information) for details. First, zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-8) templates with varying concentrations of Ru cations were hydrothermally treated at 80 °C (Figures S2, S3, Supporting Information), resulting in hollow nanocages due to hydrolysis and the Kirkendall effect. [32] To capture the dynamic structural transformation from solid ZIF-8 particles to hollow architectures, in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed using a liquid cell equipped with an amorphous silicon nitride membrane. After flowing the ruthenium chlori (RuCl<sub>3</sub>) solution, the particle interiors began to dissolve within 1 min, and the well-defined hollow nanocages were achieved

within ≈5 min (Figure 1a; Figures S4–S5, Supporting Information). The resulting sample was then annealed in a 5% Hydrogen/Argon (H<sub>2</sub>/Ar) atmosphere at 300 °C for 2 h, yielding pre-catalyst (RuZn<sub>v</sub>O<sub>v</sub>) that retained the nanocage structure (Figure S6, Supporting Information). To remove the unstable component, the pre-catalyst was subjected to acid etching. Although this treatment substantially reduced the Zn content, a minor amount (less than 1 at%) remained, as confirmed by both energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) (Figure S7, Supporting Information). According to the Pourbaix diagram (Figure S8, Supporting Information), Zn species are thermodynamically unstable under alkaline HOR conditions and are expected to dissolve. Thus, the residual Zn is unlikely to affect the catalytic performance. High-angle angular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM, Figure 1b) reveals that the Ru NGs retain the hollow nanocage structure after etching. Moreover, abundant pores are generated across the shell (Figure S9, Supporting Information), which facilitate mass transport and consequently the catalytic kinetics. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns in Figure 1c show that prominent diffraction peaks located at  $38.4^{\circ}$ ,  $42.2^{\circ}$ , and  $44.0^{\circ}$ , corresponding to the (1010), (0002), and (1011) planes of h-Ru (JCPDS No. 06-0663), respectively. Highresolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images (Figure 1d,e) reveal that the porous nanocages consist of numerous equiaxed Ru nanograins with an average size of  $\approx$ 3.5 nm. It is well known that (0002) is the most stable surface and thus most likely to appear on the as-synthesized h-Ru.[33] By contrast, Ru (1011) facets are less stable, which thus are energetically inaccessible. For example, the commercial Ru/C catalyst exposes primarily the (0002) facets (Figure S10, Supporting Information). Intriguingly, Figure 1f reveals that, besides some (0002) facets, the newly h-Ru NGs expose a large amount of (1011) facets (Figure S11, Supporting Information). To understand the formation of rich (1011) facets on our Ru NGs, we computed the surface free energy of (1011) and (0002) under relevant experimental synthesis conditions. At an H<sub>2</sub> pressure of 5 atm, the surface free energy difference between (1011) and (0002) decrease significantly with increasing temperature (Figure 1g). This difference reduces from 15 meV  $Å^{-2}$  at 163 K to 3 meV  $Å^{-2}$  at the synthesis temperature of 573.15 K. Notably, variations in H<sub>2</sub> pressure show negligible impact on the preferential facet formation (Table S1, Supporting Information). These results indicate that by adjusting the synthesis conditions, the formation of (1011) facets become more energetically favorable than that of the (0002) facets. As shown by EDS elemental mapping (Figure 1h), Ru, C, and N are uniformly distributed throughout the Ru NGs. The Ru content in the optimized Ru NGs was determined by ICP-MS (Table S2, Supporting Information) to be 44.5 wt%. In addition, commercial Ru/C, Ru nanoparticles (NPs, Figure S12, Supporting Information), and a series of Ru NGs samples synthesized using different Ru precursor concentrations (Figure \$13, Supporting Information) were included as reference catalysts.

To explore changes of oxidation state and local structure of Ru NGs, we performed X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) measurements. As depicted in **Figures 2a** and S14 (Supporting Information), the peaks at 463.9 and 475.5 eV were assigned to Ru oxide and interstitial  $Zn(Zn_i)$ , respectively.<sup>[34]</sup> After  $H_2$  reduction, the oxidized Ru was

reduced to metallic, and the  $\mathrm{Zn_i}$  peak disappeared after acid etching, indicating that the obtained Ru NGs possess a clean Ru surface. The valence state of Ru NGs was further confirmed by X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra. Figure 2b shows that the Ru K-edge adsorption edge position for Ru NGs closely resembles that of Ru foil. The peak energy of Ru NGs

shifts ≈0.5 eV higher than Ru foil (Figure 2c), indicates predominantly metallic Ru. This minor shift can be attributed to trace Ru-O coordination, likely at the surface, leading to a slightly increased average oxidation state. To understand the local coordination environment of the catalysts, we analyzed the extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra of Ru NGs, Ru foil,

RuCl3, and ruthenium dioxide (RuO2). As shown in Figure 2d, a primary peak of Ru NGs at 2.25 Å corresponds to Ru-Ru scattering, while a weak shoulder peak at 1.4 Å is ascribed to Ru-O coordination.[\[36\]](#page-8-0) These findings are consistent with the results from the wavelet-transformed EXAFS analysis (Figure 2e). In addition, fitting the Ru *K*-edge EXAFS reveals a decrease in Ru-Ru coordination numbers from 12 in Ru foil to ≈4.2 of Ru NGs, likely due to abundant grain boundaries in porous Ru nanocages (Figure S15 and Table S3, Supporting Information).[\[37\]](#page-8-0) These boundaries may promote varied facet conjunctions, thereby enhancing synergistic effects among the facets.

## **2.2. Electrocatalytic HOR Performance**

The electrochemical HOR performance of Ru NGs, Ru NPs, commercial Pt/C, commercial Ru/C, and ZIF-8 was evaluated in H2-saturated 0.1 M KOH electrolyte using a standard threeelectrode cell. To mitigate pseudocapacitive contributions from cyclic voltammograms (CVs), ref. [\[38\]](#page-8-0) the HOR currents for each catalyst were measured at different potentials through potentiostatic steps (Figure S16, Supporting Information). In **Figure 3**[a,](#page-4-0) the optimized Ru NGs catalyst displays a negatively shifted halfwave potential of ≈15 mV compared to the commercial Pt/C catalyst, indicating its superior HOR activity (Figure S17, Supporting Information). We found that the HOR currents of Ru/C and Ru NPs decreased when the potential exceeded ≈75 and 170 mV, respectively, a phenomenon commonly observed in Rubased catalysts during HOR.[\[39–41\]](#page-8-0) By contrast, the Ru NGs exhibit a much higher anodic current density across a wide operating window up to 0.3 V, which greatly reduces the risk of passivation in AEMFC.[\[26\]](#page-8-0) These results indicate that the newly designed Ru NGs could alleviate the formation of oxygenated Ru species on the catalyst surface.

Kinetic current densities (*j* k) of the catalysts were obtained using the Koutecky-Levich equation to evaluate the HOR kinetics of the catalysts. Polarization curves for Ru NGs at different rotation rates were measured (Figure S18, Supporting Information), showing an increase in current density with increasing rotation rate due to enhanced mass transportation. The slope of Koutecky-Levich for Ru NGs was determined to be 11.45 cm<sup>2</sup> mA<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> rpm1/2, which is consistent with a two-electron HOR process.[\[42\]](#page-8-0) Figure [3b](#page-4-0) shows the Tafel plots of *j* <sup>k</sup> of the catalysts, exhibiting a good symmetry, which displays the high activity of the Ru NGs. The exchange current density (*j* 0) of Ru NGs was determined to be 2.62 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> using the Butler-Volmer equation from the micropolarization region (Figure S19, Supporting Information). This value is 5.5 times that of Ru/C and 1.4 times that of Pt/C, respectively. The Ru NGs catalyst exhibits a geometric *j* <sup>k</sup> of 61 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> at an overpotential of 50 mV, which is 25.6 times greater than Ru/C and 7.8 times greater than Pt/C (Figure [3c\)](#page-4-0). The *j* <sup>k</sup> of Ru NGs also compares favorably with the

values of other Ru-based HOR catalysts reported in the literature (Figure S20, Supporting Information). After normalizing the activity to the metal loading, the  $j_{\rm k,m}$  of Ru NGs is 0.684 mA  $\mu g^{-1}$ , positioning it among the most active HOR catalysts (Figure S21 and Table S4, Supporting Information). Additionally, a large ECSA of 108.1 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup> for Ru NGs was determined using the copper underpotential deposition (Cu-UPD) method (Figure S22, Supporting Information), suggesting abundant active sites exposed on Ru NGs, probably resulting from the rich Ru (1011) facets.

To investigate the water adsorption capability of the Ru NGs, we conducted in situ surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (SEIRAS) by incrementally adjusting the potential from 0.0 to 0.3 V. The broad peak observed at  $\approx\!3350~{\rm cm}^{-1}$  was attributed to the O-H stretching vibration of the interfacial water molecules.  $^{[43]}$  According to the Stark effect, the wavenumber shift with potential serves as an indicator of water adsorption on the surface.  $^{[44]}$  As shown in Figure 3d,e, the shift in the O-H stretching position of Ru NGs with increasing potential was pronounced compared to Ru NPs.

 $63.7~{\rm cm^{-1}~V^{-1}}$  was obtained for Ru NGs, greatly higher than that of Ru NPs (14.7 cm<sup>-1</sup> V<sup>-1</sup>). The notable shift in the O-H stretching vibrational wavenumber at higher potentials suggests accelerated water production on the Ru NGs surface, probably due to the unique structure of continuous grain boundaries compared to Ru NPs.

Next, we evaluated the HOR durability of the Ru NGs by conducting a chronoamperometry test at 50 mV in H<sub>2</sub>-saturated 0.1 M KOH (Figure 3g). After 4 h of continuous operation, the current density of Ru NGs decreased by only 7.3%, outperforming the 20% degradation observed for commercial Pt/C (Figure S23, Supporting Information) and other Ru-based HOR electrocatalysts reported previously.<sup>[58,59]</sup> The morphology and chemical state of the spent Ru NGs were further examined after the stability test (Figure S24, Supporting Information), showing the good preservation of the pristine porous structure with abundant nanograins. XRD and XPS analyses confirmed that the spent Ru NGs retained the metallic state.

In industrial hydrogen gas, trace CO impurities are inevitable. Therefore, a HOR catalyst with good CO tolerance is of great significance for practical fuel-cell applications. [60] We investigated the CO-tolerance ability of Ru NGs. As shown in Figure 3h, when exposed to 1,000 ppm CO, the HOR current of Ru NGs showed

a negligible decrease of less than 5% within the first 1500 s and gradually decreased by  $\approx\!14\%$  over a period of 1.5 h. Furthermore, when tested under a more severe environment with 5,000 ppm CO, Ru NGs also exhibited exceptional CO tolerance. It retained  $\approx\!70\%$  of its initial activity after 1 h of operation (Figure S25, Supporting Information). In sharp contrast, under the same operating conditions, commercial Pt/C suffered an 82% activity loss within 1000 s due to its strong CO adsorption ability. These results clearly indicate that Ru NGs possess excellent resistance to CO poisoning. Notably, the anti-CO poisoning effect of our Ru NGs also compares favorably with other related catalysts reported in the literature (Table S5, Supporting Information).

## 2.3. Electrocatalytic Performance in an AEMFC

We incorporated the Ru NGs in the anode of a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) and tested the performance in an AEMFC single cell with  $\rm H_2/O_2$  or  $\rm H_2/air$  as the gas feed. We used a self-developed AEM for evaluation, which exhibits high ion conductivity and thermal stability, capable of operating at temperatures up to 90 °C. ref. [61] The electrochemical activation energy ( $E_a$ ) of the HOR catalyst was determined from Arrhenius plots based

on the  $i_0$  versus testing temperature obtained from the rotating disk electrode results (Figure \$26, Supporting Information). The Ru NGs catalyst demonstrated a similar  $E_a$  to Pt/C for HOR in alkali, highlighting the advantages of operating at elevated temperatures in AEMFCs (Figure 4a; Table S6, Supporting Information). We employed Pt/C (60 wt%, Johnson-Matthey) as the cathodic ORR catalyst. As shown in Figure 4b, the MEA with Ru NGs anode achieved a high peak power density (PPD) of 1.31 W cm<sup>-2</sup> at 2.96 A cm<sup>-2</sup> under H<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>2</sub> condition at 90 °C, surpassing the performance (i.e., 1.02 W cm<sup>-2</sup> at 2.13 A cm<sup>-2</sup>) using Pt/C as anode. At the automotive-relevant operating cell voltage of 0.65 V, the Ru NGs anode achieves a current density of 1.57 A cm<sup>-2</sup>, 1.22 times higher than that of the MEA with Pt/C anode. Moreover, under H<sub>2</sub>/air (CO<sub>2</sub>-free) conditions (Figure 4c), the fuel cell with Ru NGs anode also delivered a notable PPD of 1.06 W cm<sup>-2</sup> at 2.29 A cm<sup>-2</sup>, compared favorably to that of 0.84 W cm<sup>-2</sup> at 1.91 A cm $^{-2}$  for the Pt/C anode.

Figure 4d compares the PPD and hydrogen utilization efficiency of the Ru NGs with other documented noble-metal-based HOR electrocatalysts under  $\rm H_2/O_2$  flow-through conditions (Table S7, Supporting Information). The high gas utilization and PPD underscore the excellent performance of Ru NGs-based AEMFC. Furthermore, we evaluated the stability of the Ru NGs anode under  $\rm H_2\text{-}O_2$  conditions at 400 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. As shown in Figure 4e, the cell exhibited less than 2.8% voltage loss over 60 h, outperforming other reported catalysts such as the Ru-Sn nanocatalyst, ref. [72] atomically vanadium dispersed carbon loaded Ru NPs, ref. [35] and Ru/MoO<sub>2</sub>, ref. [73] highlighting the superior stability of Ru NGs-based AEMFC. Overall, the en-

hanced AEMFC performance of our Ru NGs catalyst as an anode under device-relevant conditions demonstrates its potential for efficient alkaline hydrogen fuel cells.

## 2.4. Theoretical Investigation

To elucidate the origin of the enhanced HOR energetics of Ru NGs, we conducted theoretical calculations on h-Ru. Based on our experimental observations, C or N doping on the Ru surface is unlikely to occur, as shown in Table S8 (Supporting Information). Therefore, we selected the Ru (0002) and Ru (10 $\bar{1}1$ ) surfaces for investigations. Since Ru exhibits relatively strong oxophilicity, it is generally believed that oxygen and hydroxyl groups play crucial roles in influencing catalyst activity and stability. **Figure** 5a shows the calculated adsorption free energy ( $\Delta G_{\rm ads}$ ) of \*O and hydroxyl (\*OH) on Ru (0002) and Ru (10 $\bar{1}1$ ) surfaces. The  $\Delta G_{\rm ads}$  of \*O on Ru (0002) and Ru (10 $\bar{1}1$ ) surfaces are 0.13 and -0.30 eV, respectively, while the  $\Delta G_{\rm ads}$  of \*OH on these surfaces are 0.32 and 0.07 eV, respectively. Thus, both Ru surfaces bind \*O more strongly than \*OH, suggesting that catalyst oxidation occurs through \*O during HOR.

Figure 5b,c shows the calculated surface Pourbaix diagrams with varied \*O coverages for Ru ( $10\bar{1}1$ ) and Ru (0002), respectively. The oxidation-resistant regions for Ru ( $10\bar{1}1$ ) and Ru (0002) are  $^-0.15$  to 0.42 V and 0.07 to 0.30 V, respectively. As a result, the potential required to fully oxidize Ru ( $10\bar{1}1$ ) is 0.42 V, which is largely higher than 0.30 V on Ru (0002), predicting that Ru ( $10\bar{1}1$ ) possesses greater oxidation resistance than Ru (0002)

<span id="page-7-0"></span>during HOR. Hence, the broadened working potential range of Ru NGs in our experiment can be attributed to the large exposure of the Ru ( $10\bar{1}1$ ) surface.

At a typical HOR working potential of 0.20 V, the surface adsorbate coverage on Ru (1011) and Ru (0002) is 0.5 monolayer (ML) of \*O. Based on this surface state, we evaluated the HOR reaction barrier for both surfaces. As shown in Figure 5d, the rate-determining step (RDS) for both surfaces is the adsorption of \*OH. The energy barrier for the RDS on Ru (1011) is 0.31 eV, which is lower than the 0.50 eV barrier on Ru (0002), suggesting its higher HOR activity. This result explains our experimental findings, where the Ru NGs catalyst exhibits much higher HOR activity than Ru/C, which predominantly features the (0002) surface. Furthermore, Ru (1011) possesses a much higher oxidation barrier of 0.76 eV than 0.25 eV of Ru (0002), thus providing feasible active sites for HOR, as illustrated in Figure 5e. These computational results indicate that Ru (1011) facets bear not only enhanced oxidation resistance but also improved HOR activity due to their increased oxidation barrier and lowered reaction barrier.

Additionally, although the Ru NPs also show certain (1011) surfaces, the particles are highly dispersed on the support and exhibit limited facet connections. Therefore, the relatively better HOR activity of Ru NGs compared to Ru NPs could also be attributed to the presence of rich grain boundaries and surface junctions that give access to notable (1011) surfaces.

#### 3. Conclusion

In summary, we have synthesized an open-structured Ru nanocage with abundant nanograins that expose a high density of (1011) facets, which exhibit a broad working potential range up to 0.3 V, making its suitability as an anode catalyst for practical AEMFCs. The Ru NG catalyst achieves a  $j_k$  of 61 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> at 50 mV, 25.6- and 7.8-fold that for Ru/C and Pt/C, respectively. This catalyst is also highly CO tolerant. An AEMFC integrated with Ru NGs as anode reaches a high PPD of 1.31 W cm<sup>-2</sup> under H<sub>2</sub>-O<sub>2</sub> conditions and demonstrates long-term stability over 60 h with less than 2.8% voltage decay at 400 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. Experimental and theoretical studies unveiled that the presence of abundant  $(10\overline{1}1)$  surfaces play a crucial role in improving both the activity and stability of the Ru NG catalyst. Our work showcases the rational design of high-performing alkaline HOR catalysts based on Ru-based materials through facet engineering for practical application in AEMFCs.

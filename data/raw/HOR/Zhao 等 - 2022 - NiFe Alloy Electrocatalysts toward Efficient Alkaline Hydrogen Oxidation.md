# **NiFe Alloy Electrocatalysts toward Efficient Alkaline Hydrogen Oxidation**

Xinwei Zhao,[a] Chunxiao Chai,[a] Jiaqi Qin,[a] Yizheng Guo,[a] Chunxiao Wang,[a] Rui Gao,[a] Yuanyuan Cong,[b] and [Yujiang](http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6031-9804) Song\*[a]

We report the pyrolysis of NiFe-containing nanocrystals, which leads to 10.2�2.4 nm NiFe alloy particles embedded in carbon with an exceptional area specific exchange current density of 0.048 mAcmNi <sup>2</sup> toward the alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR). The high activity primarily originates from optimized hydrogen and hydroxyl adsorption strength due to alloying effect between Ni and Fe.

## **Introduction**

Hydrogen is an important energy carrier for the achievement of carbon neutrality.[1] For example, anion exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs) can realize the conversion of hydrogen to electricity.[2] Benefited from the alkaline operation environment, platinum group metal (PGM)-free electrocatalysts can be applied to the cathode and anode sides in AEMFCs. According to recent advances, PGM-free catalysts towards cathodic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in AEMFCs have exhibited comparable performance to commercial Pt/C.[3,4] However, the kinetics of anodic hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) in alkaline media is two orders of magnitude lower than that in acidic electrolytes.[5] Sluggish kinetics of alkaline HOR requires a large amount of PGM to improve the performance of AEMFCs. The loading of PGM at the anode is in the range of 0.2–1.25 mgPGM cm <sup>2</sup> and the cost remains unaffordable.[6–8] Therefore, it is of great significance to design highly efficient and low cost PGM-free HOR electrocatalysts.

So far, PGM-free alkaline HOR electrocatalysts are mainly Nibased ones.[9,10] However, Ni has inappropriate hydrogen binding energy (HBE) and hydroxyl binding energy (OHBE), which have hindered the alkaline HOR activity.[11,12] In order to tune HBE and OHBE, many efforts have been contributed to alloying with transition metal, doping with non-metal elements and modifying surface with metal oxides.[12–19] However, highly active alkaline HOR electrocatalysts remain rare. It is necessary to design and synthesize advanced Ni-based electrocatalysts with well-adjusted HBE and OHBE. It is worth noting that most of studies have focused on using Cu, Mo or CeO2 to optimize HBE and/or OHBE of Ni, while the use of Fe has rarely been reported.[20]

Herein, we report the synthesis of NiFe-containing nanocrystals by incubating a mixture of 97.2 mM of Ni(NO3)2 ·6H2O, 10.8 mM of FeCl3 and 72 mM of H3BTC (BTC=1,3,5-benzenecarboxylic acid) in N, N-dimethylformamide (DMF) under 170 °C for 1.5 h (Scheme 1 and Figure S1). In the following, the sample was purified, dried, and heat-treated at 500°C for 1 h in H2/Ar (5 vol%/95 vol%) to produce HOR electrocatalysts, labelled as Ni90Fe10 C 500 (Scheme 1). For comparison, other electrocatalysts were also synthesized with different molar ratios between Ni and Fe as well as pyrolysis atmosphere and temperature (see more details in Experimental Section).

## **Results and Discussion**

X-ray diffraction (XRD) shows that Ni90Fe10 C 500 has three face-centered cubic (fcc) characteristic (111), (200) and (220) peak residing at 44.2°, 51.4° and 75.9°, respectively (Figure 1a). Compared with standard Ni, Fe, and the electrocatalyst synthesized with only Ni-containing nanocrystals, these characteristic peaks reside in-between those of Fe and Ni. This suggests that NiFe alloy has formed in the Ni90Fe10 C 500.

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) reveals that Ni90Fe10 C 500 comprises of 10.2�2.4 nm nanoparticles in Figure 1b and Figure S2. High-resolution TEM (HRTEM) shows [a] *X. Zhao, C. Chai, J.

0.21 nm, which is assigned to (111) crystal planes of NiFe alloy (Figure 1c–d). High-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) scanning TEM and elemental mapping show uniform distribution and overlay of Ni and Fe elements in carbon matrix (Figure 1e–i), which confirms the formation of NiFe alloy, consistent with the XRD and HRTEM results.

Alkaline HOR activity was investigated by using a rotating disk electrode (RDE) in a typical three-electrode system. 
[21-24] Cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves were recorded in N<sub>2</sub>-saturated 0.1 M KOH aqueous solution at 25 °C (Figure 2a). The anodic current at 0.30–0.35 V vs. RHE comes from the oxidation of Ni species and is related to the strength of OHBE. 
[25] It is worth

noting that the anodic peak of  $Ni_{90}Fe_{10}$ –C–500 positively shifts about 21 mV as compared with that of Ni–C–500. This suggests the weakening of OHBE due to the formation of NiFe alloy. [17,26] And the electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) of  $Ni_{90}Fe_{10}$ –C–500 was determined to be 15.23  $m^2g_{Ni}^{-1}$  by the accumulated charge quantity of OH desorption from the surface of Ni (Figure 2a),which is a little higher than that of Ni–C–500(12.97  $m^2g_{Ni}^{-1}$ ).

Alkaline HOR polarization curves were recorded in  $H_2$ -saturated 0.1 M KOH aq. at 25 °C.  $Ni_{90}Fe_{10}$ –C–500 shows a higher current density toward HOR than that of Ni–C–500 (Figure 2b). The exchange current density ( $j_0$ ) was examined

from the Tafel plots fitted with Butler-Volmer equation (Figure S3a). <sup>[17]</sup> The  $j_0$  of Ni $_{90}$ Fe $_{10}$ —C–500 is 1.44 mA cm $_{disk}$ <sup>-2</sup>, higher than that of Ni—C–500 (1.32 mA cm $_{disk}$ <sup>-2</sup>). The  $j_0$  value can also be obtained from the linear fitting of micro-polarization region ranging from -5 to 5 mV vs. RHE (Figure S3b). The two  $j_0$  values are in good agreement with each other (Table S1).

According to the Ni loading determined by TGA and ICP (Figure S4 and Table S2–3), the mass normalized exchange current density  $(j_{0, m})$  of Ni<sub>90</sub>Fe<sub>10</sub>–C–500 is 7.3 Ag<sub>Ni</sub><sup>-1</sup>, which is higher than that of Ni–C–500 (6.1 Ag<sub>Ni</sub><sup>-1</sup>) as shown in Figure 2c. This  $j_{0, m}$  is higher than most of other Ni-based HOR electrocatalysts (Table S4). The ECSA normalized exchange current density  $(j_{0, s})$  of Ni<sub>90</sub>Fe<sub>10</sub>–C–500 is calculated to be 0.048 mAcm<sub>Ni</sub><sup>-2</sup>, which is slightly higher than that of Ni–C–500 (0.047 mAcm<sub>Ni</sub><sup>-2</sup>) and most of other reported Ni-based electrocatalysts (Table S4).

Figure 2d shows alkaline HOR polarization curves of  $Ni_{90}Fe_{10}$ —C–500 in  $H_2$ -saturated 0.1 M KOH aq. with rotation speed from 2500 rpm to 400 rpm, as well as the Koutecky-Levich plot fitted at an overpotential of 50 mV.<sup>[17]</sup> The kinetic current density ( $j_k$ ) was calculated to be 2.17 mAcm<sub>disk</sub><sup>-2</sup> at 50 mV and corresponding mass activity is 11.0 A  $g_{Ni}^{-1}$ , which is comparable to documented Ni-based electrocatalysts (Table S4).

We are curious about the origin of the excellent alkaline HOR activity and the role of Fe. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) shows that with the increase of Fe contents, the binding energy of Ni<sup>o</sup> shifts to higher value and the binding energy of Fe<sup>o</sup> shifts to lower value (Figure 3). Especially, the binding energy of Ni<sup>o</sup> of Ni<sub>90</sub>Fe<sub>10</sub>—C—500 becomes 0.2 eV much stronger with respect to that of Ni—C—500 (Figure 3 and Figure S5). This trend verifies the charge transfer from Ni to Fe. The charge transfer down-shifts the Ni d-band center of NiFe

alloy, resulting in weakened binding energy of adsorbed hydrogen species (H<sub>ads</sub>) and hydroxyl species (OH<sub>ads</sub>).<sup>[25,27]</sup> Furthermore, the valence band of Ni<sub>90</sub>Fe<sub>10</sub>—C–500 and Ni-C-500 was also investigated (Figure S6). The calculated dband center shifts away from the Fermi level (E<sub>F</sub>) from 2.62 eV for Ni–C–500 to 2.77 eV for  $Ni_{90}Fe_{10}$ –C–500, which indicates the OHBE of Ni<sub>90</sub>Fe<sub>10</sub>-C-500 is weaker than that of Ni-C-500. The CV curve clearly shows the OHBE has been weakened relative to that of Ni-C-500, consistent with the XPS results.

We found that the Ni/Fe ratio, pyrolysis atmosphere and temperature can influence alkaline HOR activity. By varying the Ni/Fe molar ratio, a series of  $Ni_xFe_y$ -C-500 (x=95, 90, 70, 50 and 30, y = 100-x) has been synthesized as shown by XRD and TEM (Figure S7-8). Ni<sub>90</sub>Fe<sub>10</sub>-C-500 has the highest HOR activity based on LSV,  $j_0$  and  $j_{0, s}$  as well as  $j_{0, m}$  (Figure 4a-b) in that it possesses the smallest average NiFe particle size and appropriate HBE and OHBE according to XPS (Figure 3) and CV (Figure S9).

(a) alkaline HOR polarization curves of  $Ni_xFe_y$ –C–500 (x = 95, 90, 70, 50 and 30, y = 100 - x) recorded in H<sub>2</sub>-saturated 0.1 M KOH aq. at a rotating speed of 2500 rpm and a scan rate of 5 mV s $^{-1}$ ; (b) the  $j_{0,\,m}$  and  $j_{0,\,s}$  of NixFey–C–500 (x = 95, 90 and 70, y = 100-x); (c) alkaline HOR polarization curves of  $Ni_{90}Fe_{10}$ –C–T (T = 400, 450, 500, 550 and 600) recorded in  $H_2$ saturated 0.1 M KOH aq. at a rotating speed of 2500 rpm and a scan rate of 5 mV s<sup>-1</sup>; (d) the  $j_{0,m}$  and  $j_{0,s}$  of Ni<sub>90</sub>Fe<sub>10</sub>–C–T (T=400, 450, 500, 550 and 600); (e) Chronoamperometry curves of  $Ni_{90}Fe_{10}$ –C–500 and Ni–C–500 recorded in H<sub>2</sub>-saturated 0.1 M KOH at 0.1 V vs. RHE and a rotation speed of 600 rpm; (f) the current density of  $\mathrm{Ni_{90}Fe_{10}-C-500}$  and  $\mathrm{Ni-C-500}$  at 0.1 V vs. RHE before and after stability test.

Ni<sub>90</sub>Fe<sub>10</sub>-C-500 has a much higher alkaline HOR activity than that of Ni<sub>90</sub>Fe<sub>10</sub>-C-500-Ar synthesized under Ar instead of H<sub>2</sub>/Ar mixture (Figure \$10). XRD shows that the NiFe alloy of Ni<sub>90</sub>Fe<sub>10</sub>–C–500–Ar has not formed as well as that of Ni<sub>90</sub>Fe<sub>10</sub>–C–500 (Figure S11). We propose that this has led to a lower ECSA and stronger OHBE (Figure S12), thus seriously jeopardizing the alkaline HOR activity.

By tuning the pyrolysis temperature, a sequence of Ni<sub>90</sub>Fe<sub>10</sub>-C-T (T=400, 450, 500, 550 and 600) has been prepared as shown by TGA, XRD, RAMAN and TEM (Figure S13-15). Ni<sub>90</sub>Fe<sub>10</sub>-C-500 exhibits the highest HOR activity based on LSV,  $j_0$  and  $j_{0,s}$  as well as  $j_{0,m}$  (Figure 4c-d), which originates from the small average particle size and optimal OHBE (Figure S16).

Stability is another critical parameter of HOR electrocatalysts. Thus, the stability of Ni<sub>90</sub>Fe<sub>10</sub>-C-500 and Ni-C-500 were measured by 3 h of chronoamperometry at 0.1 V vs. RHE in H<sub>2</sub>saturated 0.1 M KOH aqueous solution as shown in Figure 4e-f. The current density of Ni<sub>90</sub>Fe<sub>10</sub>–C–500 degrades 26.0%, much better than that of Ni-C-500 (47.6%). After the stability test, the average diameters of NiFe alloy nanoparticles become slightly larger from  $10.2\pm2.4\,\mathrm{nm}$  to  $11.0\pm2.0\,\mathrm{nm}$  (Figure S17). We speculate that the alloying effect of Ni and Fe could improve the stability of Ni<sub>90</sub>Fe<sub>10</sub>–C–500. The loss of stability can be attributed to the formation of Ni(OH), and FeO, [28]

#### Conclusion

In summary, we synthesized 10.2 ± 2.4 nm NiFe alloy nanoparticles embedded in carbon matrix by pyrolysis of NiFecontaining nanocrystals. Benefiting from the optimal HBE and OHBE tuned by NiFe alloy, Ni<sub>90</sub>Fe<sub>10</sub>-C-500 exhibits excellent HOR performance in terms of high area specific activity (0.048 mA cm<sub>Ni</sub><sup>-2</sup>), mass specific activity (7.3 A  $g_{Ni}^{-1}$ ) and stability. This study provides a new synthetic route for the creation of inexpensive PGM-free HOR electrocatalysts.

#### **Experimental Section**

Synthesis of Ni-containing and Ni<sub>x</sub>Fe<sub>y</sub>-containing nanocrystals (x=95, 90, 70, 50 and 30, y=100-x)

 $Ni(NO_3)_2 \cdot 6H_2O$  (315.1 mg, 99%) and  $H_3BTC$  (151.3 mg, 98%) were dissolved in DMF (10 mL) under ultrasonic for 20 min at room temperature. Next, the solution was transferred into a 25 mL Teflon-lined autoclave and kept at 170 °C for 1.5 h. After cooling down to room temperature, the resulting suspension was centrifugated and washed with DMF once and ethanol twice, and dried at 65°C in an oven overnight. Finally, the green powder was ground fully. The synthesis of  $Ni_xFe_y$ -containing nanocrystals (x = 95, 90, 70, 50 and 30, y = 100-x) was similar to Ni-containing nanocrystals. The difference is the addition of FeCl<sub>3</sub> into DMF. After the solvothermal treatment, centrifugation, washing and oven dry, the powder is yellow.

Synthesis of Ni–C–500, Ni $_x$ Fe $_y$ –C–500 (x = 95, 90, 70, 50 and 30, y = 100–x), Ni $_{90}$ Fe $_{10}$ –C–T (400, 450, 500, 550 and 600) and Ni $_{90}$ Fe $_{10}$ –C–500–Ar electrocatalysts

Alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) electrocatalysts were prepared by pyrolysis of precursors above. Typically, 200 mg Nicontaining nanocrystals or Ni<sub>x</sub>Fe<sub>y</sub>-containing nanocrystals (x=95, 90, 70, 50 and 30, y=100-x) were loaded into a quartz tube furnace. The system was flushed with a mixed H<sub>2</sub>/Ar (5 vol%/95 vol%) for 30 min at a flow rate of 400 mL min<sup>-1</sup> to remove air. Then the sample was heated to 500 °C with a ramping rate of 5 °C min<sup>-1</sup> and holding at the temperature for 1 h. After cooling down to room temperature, pure Ar was flushed into the tube at a flow rate of 300 mL min<sup>-1</sup> for 1 h to exclude H<sub>2</sub>. H<sub>2</sub> adsorbed on the surface can lead to burning once contacting with air. Ni<sub>90</sub>Fe<sub>10</sub>-C-T (400, 450, 500, 550 and 600) was synthesized similarly, except the pyrolysis temperature was set at 400, 450, 500, 550 and 600 °C. While Ni<sub>90</sub>Fe<sub>10</sub>-C-500-Ar used Ar instead of mixed H<sub>2</sub>/Ar during pyrolyzing treatment.

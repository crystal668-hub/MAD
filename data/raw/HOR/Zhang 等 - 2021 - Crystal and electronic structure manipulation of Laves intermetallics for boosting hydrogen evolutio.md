Since the 1970s, Laves intermetallics (AB<sub>2</sub>) have been widely used in hydrogen storage technology (e.g., nickel-metal hydride batteries) due to the abundant interstitial sites and moderate metal-hydrogen bond strength ( $E_{M-H}$ ). They, however, have been rarely used in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) because of the same reason (i.e. moderate  $E_{M-H}$ ), which results in poor HER efficiency. In this study, by applying lanthanide contraction and ligand effect, we have successfully lowered the  $E_{M-H}$  and substantially boosted the HER activity of Laves intermetallics (RECo2 and RERu0.5Co1.5 (RE = Pr, Tb, Y and Er)) to outperform those of commercial Pt/C catalyst. Hydrogen overpotential decreases from  $ErCo_2$  ( $\eta_{10}$  = 169 mV) to  $PrCo_2$ ( $\eta_{10}$  = 113 mV) and then to PrRu<sub>0.5</sub>Co<sub>1.5</sub> ( $\eta_{10}$  = 29 mV). The expansion of lattice constants for PrCo2 may alleviate the obstacle of H atom diffusing through interstitial sites, while the inclusion of Ru element can raise the antibonding population of Co-Co/Ru bonds, which consequently lowers  $E_{M-H}$  and thus elevates HER activity according to the Sabatier principle. This outcome indicates that the manipulation of the crystal structure and electronic structure factor is an efficient strategy to boost the HER activity of Laves intermetallics.

Intermetallic compounds are solid phase materials comprising definite proportions of two or more metallic elements with highly ordered atomic arrangements.<sup>1</sup> Many classes of intermetallic compounds (*e.g.* AB<sub>2</sub>, AB<sub>3</sub> and AB<sub>5</sub> phase) are available with a wide range of chemical compositions, which allow them to have versatile functionality.<sup>2</sup> Laves phase (AB<sub>2</sub>), for instance, probably is the most abundant class of intermetallic compounds (>3000 compounds) that are applied in numerous research fields such as hydrogen storage, corrosion resistant

and magnetic refrigeration.<sup>3</sup> In particular, for hydrogen storage, Laves phase has enormous interstitial sites, which can uptake the hydrogen element in the structure to form metal hydrides, which is a relatively safe way to deposit hydrogen.<sup>4</sup> In addition, the moderate metal–hydrogen bond strength ( $E_{\rm M-H}$ ) in Laves phase accounts for the excellent insertion/depletion behaviour of hydrogen in the structure. This feature makes Laves phases quite suitable to be negative electrodes of nickelmetal hydride batteries.<sup>5</sup>

Despite the fact that Laves phase displays high potential in the field of nickel-metal hydride batteries, it is rarely utilized in the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). This is understandable considering that these two applications (i.e. electrochemical hydrogen storage and hydrogen evolution) require different metal-hydrogen bond strengths  $(E_{M-H})$ . For electrocatalytic HER, one needs to lower the bond strength of M-H bond and therefore elevate the mobility of hydrogen atom in the lattice or on the surface of electrocatalytic materials. This may enhance the collision probability and release hydrogen gas based on the Volmer-Heyrovsky and Volmer-Tafel mechanism.7 Accordingly, Laves intermetallics with rich interstitial sites in nature could exhibit outstanding HER activity if one decreased the corresponding bond strength of the M-H bond. Following this line of thinking, in this study, we propose a strategy to engineer the crystal and electronic structure of Laves intermetallics (i.e., lanthanide contraction and ligand effect) to boost their HER performances. It was realized that the overpotential  $(\eta_{10})$  at a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> for C15 Laves type RECo<sub>2</sub> (RE = Pr, Tb, Y and Er) reduced from 169 mV (ErCo2) to 113 mV (PrCo2) and can be decreased further down to 29 mV with Ru substitution (PrRu<sub>0.5</sub>Co<sub>1.5</sub>). This electrocatalytic activity has already outperformed the commercial Pt/C catalyst. More importantly, such large improvement (from 169 mV to 29 mV) of HER activity suggests the proposed strategy is effective, and thus we decide to embark on a more comprehensive investigation of RECo2 and RERu<sub>0.5</sub>Co<sub>1.5</sub> (RE = Pr, Tb, Y and Er) series.

As shown in Fig. 1a, the powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) pattern indicates that high purity of  $RECo_2$  (RE = Pr, Tb, Y and Er) series

can be readily synthesized using the rapid arc-melting technique. It crystalizes in the cubic space group Fd3m with MgCu2 structural type (C15 Laves phase) and a representative crystal structure of RECo<sub>2</sub> with tetrahedral interstitial sites is illustrated in Fig. 1 (left image).8 It was realized that the refined lattice constants from the PXRD with the Si internal standard (Fig. S1, ESI†) for these series follow lanthanide contraction and decrease from PrCo2 (a = 7.2988 Å) to ErCo<sub>2</sub> (a = 7.1366 Å). For the substitution of Co by Ru, PrRu<sub>0.25</sub>Co<sub>1.75</sub> and RERu<sub>0.5</sub>Co<sub>1.5</sub> (RE = Pr, Tb, Y and Er) series, it appears that the structure remains the same (Fig. 1b and Fig. S1c, ESI†) and it will not change to other structural types of the Laves phase (i.e. C14 MgZn<sub>2</sub> type and C36 MgNi<sub>2</sub> type).<sup>9</sup>

Notice that the diffraction patterns of RERu<sub>0.5</sub>Co<sub>1.5</sub> (RE = Pr, Tb, Y and Er) series broadened compared to those of undoped ones. This suggests a smaller crystallite size of RERu<sub>0.5</sub>Co<sub>1.5</sub> (Scherrer equation), although the particle size of RECo2 and RERu<sub>0.5</sub>Co<sub>1.5</sub> (RE = Pr, Tb, Y and Er) seems similar (dozens of micrometers) without distinct differences (Fig. S2 and S3, ESI†).<sup>10</sup> Moreover, it was recognized that replacing Co  $(R_{Co} = 2.00 \text{ Å})$  with Ru ( $R_{\text{Ru}} = 2.13 \text{ Å}$ ) will expand the corresponding lattice constants (e.g.  $PrRu_{0.5}Co_{1.5}$ , a = 7.4023 Å, Table S1,  $ESI^{\dagger}$ ), which explains the slightly left shifting of diffraction peaks for RERu<sub>0.5</sub>Co<sub>1.5</sub> (RE = Pr, Tb, Y and Er) based on the Bragg's law. 11 The above crystal analysis was further corroborated from the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) image (Fig. S4, ESI†). In addition, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and elemental mapping (Fig. S5, ESI†) indicate that the Ru element distributes homogeneous in these samples rather than a physical mixture between RECo<sub>2</sub> and Ru particles. This outcome implies the successful substitution of Ru in these compounds from this synthetic method, while the detail chemical compositions of these samples were measured and verified to be close to the nominal formula (Tables S2 and S3, ESI†).

After revealing the crystal information and phase purity of RECo<sub>2</sub> and RERu<sub>0.5</sub>Co<sub>1.5</sub> (RE = Pr, Tb, Y and Er) series, these samples were examined for their electrocatalytic HER activity in 1.0 M KOH. As displayed in Fig. 2a, linear sweep voltammograms (LSV) of RECo<sub>2</sub> (RE = Pr, Tb, Y and Er) series exhibits a clear trend and follows the order of  $PrCo_2$  ( $\eta_{10} = 113 \text{ mV}$ ) >  $TbCo_2$  $(\eta_{10} = 134 \text{ mV}) > \text{YCo}_2 (\eta_{10} = 154 \text{ mV}) > \text{ErCo}_2 (\eta_{10} = 169 \text{ mV}).$ Evidently, the lanthanide contraction ( $R_{Pr} = 2.40 \text{ Å}$ ;  $R_{Tb} = 2.33 \text{ Å}$ ;  $R_{\rm Y}$  = 2.32 Å;  $R_{\rm Er}$  = 2.29 Å) is efficient to promote corresponding HER performance, which is in accordance with previous reports of

RE<sub>2</sub>Co<sub>17</sub>. <sup>12</sup> Despite the fact that PrCo<sub>2</sub> demonstrates good HER activity, it is still not comparable to the commercial Pt/C catalyst. To further boost the HER activity of this series, Ru metal was selected to replace Co partially to form ternary RERu<sub>0.5</sub>Co<sub>1.5</sub> (RE = Pr, Tb, Y and Er). There are two reasons for the choice to incorporate Ru: (1) as reported by Mao et al., the combination of Co and Ru atoms in the lattice can significantly lower the water dissociation energy barrier, which is the first step for hydrogen adsorption in alkaline conditions; 13 (2) it may increase the population of the antibonding state for Co-Co/Ru bonds and therefore weaken metal-hydrogen bond strengths (M-H), which is the second step for hydrogen desorption as gas evolution.

It can be seen in Fig. 2b that all the compounds of  $RERu_{0.5}Co_{1.5}$  (RE = Pr, Tb, Y and Er) series exhibit exceptional HER activities that surpass that of commercial Pt/C catalyst. The overpotential  $(\eta_{10})$  for each RERu<sub>0.5</sub>Co<sub>1.5</sub> decrease ca. 80-120 mV in comparison with that of pristine one (e.g. PrCo<sub>2</sub>,  $\eta_{10}$  = 113 mV; PrRu<sub>0.5</sub>Co<sub>1.5</sub>,  $\eta_{10}$  = 29 mV). Such a dramatic drop in overpotential, truth be told, is a bit surprising. It is worth mentioning that the roughness factor (RF) of RERu<sub>0.5</sub>Co<sub>1.5</sub> (Fig. S6, ESI†) is higher than that of RECo<sub>2</sub> (Fig. S7, ESI†), which can be attributed to the smaller crystallite size, as discussed above (vide supra). Nevertheless, the surface area difference between RECo2 and RERu0.5Co1.5 (Table 1) during electrochemical measurements is still not be able to explain the high HER efficiency of RERu<sub>0.5</sub>Co<sub>1.5</sub> series since their RF normalized LSV (Fig. S8 and S9, ESI†) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS; Fig. S10, ESI†) also support this result. In addition, the Tafel slope (Table 1) of RECo2 series is

close to 120 mV dec<sup>-1</sup> and it decreases to ca. 40 mV dec<sup>-1</sup> for RERu<sub>0.5</sub>Co<sub>1.5</sub>. This implies that the Volmer step (i.e. water dissociation;  $H_2O + e^- \rightarrow H_{adsorbed} + OH^-$ ) is the ratedetermining step (R.D.S) for RECo<sub>2</sub> series, while R.D.S. changes to the Heyrovsky step (i.e. electrochemical desorption; H2O +  $H_{adsorbed}$  +  $e^- \rightarrow H_2$  +  $OH^-$ ) for  $RERu_{0.5}Co_{1.5}$  due to the inclusion of the Ru element.14

The above LSV and chronoamperometry measurement (Fig. S11, ESI†) of RECo<sub>2</sub> and RERu<sub>0.5</sub>Co<sub>1.5</sub> have shown promising and robust HER performances in alkaline electrolytes. This is further supported by the fact that there is no obvious change in the HER performance and elemental distribution for PrCo<sub>2</sub> and PrRu<sub>0.5</sub>Co<sub>1.5</sub> after 1000 cycles of continuous operation (Fig. S12, ESI†). The variation in the HER activity from ErCo<sub>2</sub>  $(\eta_{10} = 169 \text{ mV})$  to  $PrCo_2$   $(\eta_{10} = 113 \text{ mV})$  and then to  $PrRu_{0.5}Co_{1.5}$  $(\eta_{10} = 29 \text{ mV})$  suggests a tight relationship between the crystal/ electronic structure and electrocatalytic HER activity in Laves intermetallics, which warrants further investigation. As displayed in Fig. 3a, there is a linear relationship between the Co-Co/Ru bond length (Å) and overpotential (mV) of RECo<sub>2</sub> and  $RERu_{0.5}Co_{1.5}$  (RE = Pr, Tb, Y and Er). It is evident that the "slope" of this linear regression line is very different between RECo<sub>2</sub> and RERu<sub>0.5</sub>Co<sub>1.5</sub> series. The steep slope for RECo<sub>2</sub> indicates that the change in the Co-Co/Ru bond length is more influential to the corresponding HER activity, which is a manifestation that the crystal structural factor (i.e. lanthanide contraction) plays a major role here. This slope becomes more

horizontal and overpotential drops substantially once the Ru element is included. Clearly, the influence of the Co-Co/Ru bond length towards HER activity is less profound in RERu<sub>0.5</sub>Co<sub>1.5</sub> series and the electronic structural factor may outweigh the crystal structural factor in this series.

Note that the average bond length (Å) of the Co-Co/Ru bond is around 2.7 Å and 2.8 Å for RECo2 and RERu0.5Co1.5, respectively, when overpotential reaches 0 mV (x-interception). This is an interesting coincidence to the report of Henry Leidheiser, Jr. that 2.7 Å is the interatomic spacing of some body-center metals (e.g. Mo and W) and face-center cubic metals (e.g. Pt, Ir, Pd and Rh) with minimum hydrogen overvoltage. 15 The expansion of lattice constants as well as Co-Co bond lengths from  $ErCo_2$  (a = 7.1366 Å) to  $PrCo_2$  (a = 7.2988 Å) may enlarge the cavity spacing of interstitial sites, which facilitates the mobility of hydrogen atoms in lattice. Notice that the inclusion of Ru element ( $R_{Ru} = 2.13 \text{ Å}$ ) will also increase the lattice constant of  $PrRu_{0.5}Co_{1.5}$  (a = 7.4023 Å). However, only this crystal structural factor is insufficient to account for such large improvement of HER activity from  $PrCo_2$  ( $\eta_{10} = 113$  mV) to  $PrRu_{0.5}Co_{1.5}$  ( $\eta_{10} = 29$  mV). As a matter of fact, in Fig. 3b, even with a small amount of Co is replaced by Ru, PrRu<sub>0.25</sub>Co<sub>1.75</sub> can demonstrate very close HER efficiency ( $\eta_{10}$  = 41 mV) compared to that of PrRu<sub>0.5</sub>Co<sub>1.5</sub>. This intrinsic property (RF normalized LSV in Fig. S13, ESI†) suggests that doping Ru element may modify the electronic structure, which is another effective approach to improve the HER activity of electrocatalysts.

In order to understand how the electronic structural factor influences the HER activity due to the Ru inclusion, their total and partial density of states (TDOS and PDOS) were calculated using the tight binding linear muffin-tin orbital (TB-LMTO) method, as illustrated in Fig. S14 (ESI†). In addition, the crystal orbital Hamilton population (COHP) method was applied to reveal the bonding interaction and bonding scheme of Co-Co/ Ru bonds. This result along with the H adsorption energy  $(\Delta GH_{ad})$  diagram is provided in Fig. 4, and the model is illustrated in Fig. S15 (ESI†). YCo2 and YRu0.25Co1.75 were chosen as examples because Y element does not have f electrons and is convenient for DFT calculation. In other words, the TDOS and PDOS of YCo2 and YRu0.25Co1.75 are similar with each other (Fig. S14, ESI†) except that there is additional density of states appearing above the Fermi level  $(E_F)$  for

YRu<sub>0,25</sub>Co<sub>1,75</sub>. As seen from the arrow pointing in Fig. 4a, the -COHP curves of Co-Co/Ru bonds are in the negative region, indicating the antibonding character of this additional density of states. This means replacing Co with Ru will increase the anti-bonding states of Co-Co/Ru bonds and it will inevitably increase the anti-bonding characters of the adsorbate level. Accordingly, it can weaken the binding strength between H and Co-Co/Ru bonds (Fig. 4b), which results in the elevated HER activity of YRu<sub>0.25</sub>Co<sub>1.75</sub>.

The above experimental facts reveal that the manipulation of the crystal structural and electronic structural factor both can enhance the HER activity of Laves intermetallics but in a different way. The expansion of lattice constants of RECo2 (via lanthanide contraction) may alleviate the obstacle of H atom diffusing through interstitial sites while the inclusion of Ru element can raise the antibonding population of Co-Co/Ru bonds and consequently lower the metal-hydrogen bond strength (M-H). This strategy greatly boosts the HER activity of Laves intermetallics to have outstanding HER performance than the commercial Pt/C catalyst, which makes an old material a new application.

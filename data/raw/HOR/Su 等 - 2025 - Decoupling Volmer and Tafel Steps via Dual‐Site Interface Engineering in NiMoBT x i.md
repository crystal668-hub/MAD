# **Decoupling Volmer and Tafel Steps via Dual-Site Interface** Engineering in Ni/MoBT, for Efficient Hydrogen **Electrocatalysis**

Hai-Liang Su, Wei Liao, Shao-Xin Mo, Hongjuan Wang, Yonghai Cao, Hao Yu, and Hao-Fan Wang\*

Metallic nickel is a promising Pt-free catalyst for alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), but suffers from sluggish water dissociation in the Volmer step and excessively strong hydrogen adsorption in the Tafel step. These two steps impose conflicting demands on surface binding strength, making it difficult to optimize both on a single active site. To address this issue, a dual-site synergistic catalyst is constructed by coupling Ni with a MoBT, support possessing strong water dissociation ability. This design enables water dissociation on MoBT, and subsequent transfer of generated hydrogen species to adjacent Ni sites via reverse hydrogen spillover, thus decoupling Volmer and Tafel steps for hydrogen evolution. Experimental and computational results consistently verify this mechanism. Meanwhile, the metal-support interaction modulates the electronic structure of Ni, tuning the intermediate binding energies to favorable levels for both HER and hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR). Benefiting from this design, the Ni/MoBT, heterogeneous electrocatalyst exhibits superior HER performance to Pt/C (32 mV@10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>; Tafel slope: 26.8 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>), and achieves Pt-comparable HOR activity with a mass activity of 60.29 mA mg<sub>Ni</sub><sup>-1</sup> at 50 mV. This work highlights 2D metal borides as efficient platforms for alkaline hydrogen electrocatalysis and proposes a dual-site design to boost catalytic performance.

## 1. Introduction

The growing global demand for energy remains predominantly met by fossil fuels, which constitute over 80% of the current energy consumption.<sup>[1]</sup> However, their combustion results in substantial greenhouse gas emissions, posing severe environmental challenges.<sup>[2]</sup> In this context, hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) has emerged as a promising carbon-neutral energy carrier due to its high energy density and environmental compatibility.[3] Among various

methods for hydrogen production, electrochemical water splitting is particularly attractive for coupling with renewable energy sources, offering a sustainable route for large-scale hydrogen generation. In this process, the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) serves as the critical cathodic reaction. Compared with acidic systems, alkaline HER has attracted particular attention due to its lower cost, enhanced stability at high current densities, and compatibility with non-preciousmetal catalysts, making it especially promising for large-scale deployment.[4]

In alkaline media, HER proceeds via a two-step pathway. The first step is the Volmer reaction ( $H_2O + e^- \rightarrow H^* + OH^-$ ), where water dissociates to produce adsorbed hydrogen atoms (H\*). In the second step, hydrogen molecules are generated and desorbed through either Tafel (2H\*  $\rightarrow$  H<sub>2</sub>) or Heyrovsky (H<sub>2</sub>O + H\* + e<sup>-</sup>  $\rightarrow$  H<sub>2</sub> + OH<sup>-</sup>) pathway.<sup>[4c,5]</sup> Therefore, an ideal HER catalyst should both promote efficient water dissociation and achieve optimal hydrogen binding strength. Specifically, the hydrogen adsorption free energy

 $(\Delta G_{H*})$  needs to approach zero, as dictated by the Sabatier principle, to balance hydrogen adsorption and desorption.[6]

Pt-based catalysts possess near-optimal properties for HER, but their high cost and limited availability hinder their largescale deployment.<sup>[7]</sup> These limitations have prompted the exploration of Pt-free alternatives that can deliver comparable performance with enhanced sustainability. Nickel has attracted considerable attention as a Pt-free HER catalyst due to its earth abundance, low cost, and excellent stability in alkaline environments, offering a viable alternative for practical hydrogen production.<sup>[8]</sup> Despite these advantages, metallic Ni suffers from sluggish water dissociation kinetics and overly strong hydrogen adsorption, both of which restrict its catalytic performance in alkaline environments.[8b,9] Enhancing water dissociation typically involves shifting the Ni d-band center closer to the Fermi level to strengthen intermediate adsorption.<sup>[10]</sup> However, this electronic modulation also tends to increase the hydrogen binding strength on Ni sites, further hindering the already difficult hydrogen desorption and limiting overall HER efficiency.[11] This trade-off **[www.advancedsciencenews.com](http://www.advancedsciencenews.com) [www.afm-journal.de](http://www.afm-journal.de)**

presents a fundamental limitation for simultaneously optimizing both water dissociation and hydrogen desorption at a single catalytic site.

To overcome the intrinsic limitations of single-site catalysts, we propose a heterostructured dual-site strategy that separates water dissociation and hydrogen adsorption onto different active components. In this configuration, the second component serves as an efficient site for water dissociation, accelerating the Volmer step and supplying hydrogen intermediates (H\*) to neighboring Ni sites for hydrogen evolution. Additionally, metal–support interactions at the interface may modulate the electronic structure of Ni, enabling more favorable hydrogen binding and improved catalytic efficiency. To realize this design, the second component should possess strong water dissociation capability. Among various candidates, molybdenum-based compounds exhibit excellent water activation properties,[\[12\]](#page-11-0) making them highly attractive as catalytic substrates for HER. However, their conventional forms, such as oxides, phosphides, and sulfides, often suffer from insufficient electrical conductivity and poor durability under alkaline conditions, thus constraining their practical deployment in HER catalysis.[\[12b,13\]](#page-11-0) Recently, 2D transition metal borides, known as MBenes, have emerged as promising catalyst supports due to their high surface area, excellent electrical conductivity, and strong corrosion resistance.[\[14\]](#page-11-0) Derived from selective etching of layered MAB-phase precursors (where M is a transition metal, A is typically Al, and B is boron), MBenes possess structural features analogous to MXenes, making them attractive for electrocatalytic applications.[\[15\]](#page-11-0) Therefore, combining the water activation capability with favorable conductivity and stability, MoBT*<sup>x</sup>* (T represents terminal groups) MBene provides a suitable platform for the design of efficient HER electrocatalysts.

Beyond serving as a water dissociation site, the intrinsic high conductivity and interfacial compatibility of MBenes may facilitate the reverse hydrogen spillover from MBene to adjacent Ni active sites, effectively bridging water dissociation with subsequent hydrogen evolution. In addition, compared to supports containing more electronegative heteroatoms such as O, N, P, or S, boron-based MBene enables a more moderate modulation of the Ni electronic structure, which may thereby preserve an optimal *d*band center for balanced hydrogen adsorption and desorption.[\[16\]](#page-11-0) Taken together, the integration of MoBT*<sup>x</sup>* as a functional support is expected to promote the full catalytic process of HER, and offer a promising foundation for realizing the proposed dual-site HER catalyst design.

Guided by these insights, a heterostructure of metallic Ni and MoBT*<sup>x</sup>* MBene (Ni/MoBT*x*) is proposed as an efficient electrocatalyst for hydrogen electrode reactions in alkaline media. In the heterostructure, Mo sites in MoBT*<sup>x</sup>* preferentially bind H2O and transfer hydrogen intermediates to Ni sites via reverse hydrogen spillover. The interfacial charge redistribution shifts the Ni *d*-band center, thereby optimizing hydrogen adsorption and facilitating H2 release. This dual-site design spatially decouples and simultaneously promotes the Volmer and Tafel steps, thus boosting alkaline HER activity. In addition to HER, the heterostructure simultaneously promotes hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) by modulating the binding energies of hydrogen and hydroxyl species. As a result, Ni/MoBT*<sup>x</sup>* delivers an overpotential of 32 mV at 10 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> and a Tafel slope of 26.8 mV dec<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> for HER, outperforming commercial Pt/C, along with a HOR mass activity of 60.29 mA mgNi<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> at 50 mV. Overall, this work offers valuable insights into the rational design of dual-site electrocatalysts for efficient alkaline hydrogen electrocatalysis, while expanding the electrocatalytic application of emerging MBene materials.

# **2. Results and Discussion**

### **2.1. Synthesis and Structural Characterization**

To construct the Ni/MoBT*<sup>x</sup>* heterostructure, bulk MoAlB was first treated by alkaline hydrothermal etching to selectively remove Al layers. Then Ni<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> was in situ reduced onto the delaminated MBene via a NaBH4-mediated process, and finally the hybrid material was annealed at 350 °C under 10% H2/Ar to stabilize the structure, as illustrated in **Figure 1**[a.](#page-2-0)

The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of MoAlB precursor in Figure [1b](#page-2-0) displays sharp and well-defined reflections, matching the orthorhombic MoAlB phase (PDF#97-001-6777). After alkaline etching, MoBT*<sup>x</sup>* exhibits broadened and weakened peaks, consistent with partial Al deintercalation and disruption of longrange crystallinity.[\[17\]](#page-11-0) The (020) peak of the etched MBene shifted to higher angles compared with MoAlB, indicating effective Al extraction and multilayered-MBene formation.[\[18\]](#page-11-0) Such a shift is attributed to the partial removal and rearrangement of Al double layers into single layers during alkaline etching, which shortens the interlayer periodicity.[\[15e\]](#page-11-0) For the Ni/MoBT*<sup>x</sup>* sample, additional reflections at 44.5°, 51.8°, and 76.4° are observed, corresponding to the (111), (200), and (220) planes of face-centered cubic Ni (PDF#04-003-2969), while the characteristic peaks of MoBT*<sup>x</sup>* are well preserved. These structural features collectively suggest the successful fabrication of the Ni/MoBT*<sup>x</sup>* heterostructure.

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis reveals that the pristine MoAlB exhibits a compact and smooth morphology (Figure [1c\)](#page-2-0). By comparison, the etched MoBT*<sup>x</sup>* displays a characteristic accordion-like structure with pronounced interlayer delamination (Figure S1, Supporting Information), indicating successful Al removal. This accordion-like morphology is further confirmed by the high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM, Figure [1d\)](#page-2-0), which shows expanded multilayered nanosheets with a typical thickness of 80100 nm and etching-induced cavities of 20–30 nm. In contrast to the dense structure of the MoAlB precursor, this expanded multilayered structure leads to an increased specific surface area (Figure S2, Supporting Information). Additionally, the energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) elemental mapping of MoBT*<sup>x</sup>* (Figure S5, Supporting Information) reveals oxygen incorporation, suggesting the formation of oxygen-containing functional groups on the MBene surface during hydrothermal treatment. These morphology and surface modifications collectively offer abundant anchoring sites for subsequent Ni deposition. XPS and EDX analyses reveal a pronounced decrease in Al content after etching (Figure S3–S5, Supporting Information), unambiguously confirming the effective Al removal and the successful formation of multilayer MoBT*<sup>x</sup>* MBene. In addition, STEM coupled with electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) further verifies this transformation (Figures S6 and S7, Supporting Information), showing preserved Mo M-edge and B K-edge that evidence the intact Mo–B framework, along with a more intense O K-edge

consistent with surface oxidation.[\[15h,19\]](#page-11-0) Notably, the sharper Mo M45- and M23-edges highlight subtle electronic modulation induced by the layered structure. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, Figure S8, Supporting Information) images reveal clear lattice fringes of the (110), (041), and (150) planes, confirming that the Mo–B framework of etched MoBT*<sup>x</sup>* remains locally crystalline despite partial disorder. These results collectively verify the structural integrity of the MBene scaffold for subsequent Ni deposition.

Benefiting from these features, after Ni loading, Ni/MoBT*<sup>x</sup>* exhibits a uniform dispersion of Ni nanoparticles across the MoBT*<sup>x</sup>* layers, as observed in the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image (Figure [1e\)](#page-2-0). Statistical analysis of particle size distribution further reveals a narrow range centered at ≈11.52 nm (Figure S9, Supporting Information), corroborating the morphological homogeneity of Ni/MoBT*x*. HRTEM analysis (Figure [1f\)](#page-2-0) further shows lattice fringes with *d*-spacings of 0.196 nm and 0.214 nm, corresponding to the Ni (111) and MoBT*<sup>x</sup>* (150) planes, respectively. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (Figure [1g\)](#page-2-0) displays diffraction rings indexed to Ni (111), (200), and (220), along with bright spots ascribed to the (110) and (150) planes of MoBT*x*, confirming the coexistence and crystalline nature of both components. Elemental mapping (Figure [1h\)](#page-2-0) clearly demonstrates the homogeneous distribution of Ni, Mo, B, and O in the hybrid material. These observations verify the integration of Ni nanoparticles with the MoBT*<sup>x</sup>* support to form a well-defined heterostructure.

#### 2.2. Electrocatalytic HER Performance

The electrochemical HER performance of Ni/MoBT, was evaluated in Ar-saturated 1.0 M KOH electrolyte with a standard three-electrode system. To identify the optimal synthesis condition, a series of Ni/MoBTx samples were prepared at different reduction temperatures (Figure \$10, Supporting Information). Among them, the catalyst reduced at 350 °C exhibits the sharpest Ni diffraction peaks, indicating optimal crystallinity and interfacial coupling, which correlates with its highest HER activity (Figure S13, Supporting Information), and is thus selected for further investigation. For comparison, graphene oxide supported Ni (Ni/GO) and pure Ni nanoparticles were synthesized (Figures S11 and S12, Supporting Information), serving as contrast samples along with MoBT, and commercial Pt/C. As shown in the linear sweeping voltammetry (LSV) curves in Figure 2a, at the current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, Ni/MoBT<sub>x</sub> requires an overpotential ( $\eta_{10}$ ) of only 32 mV, outperforming MoBT<sub>x</sub> (245 mV), Ni/GO (163 mV), Ni (305 mV), and even commercial Pt/C (39 mV), underscoring its excellent HER activity (Figure 2b). Among these catalysts, Ni/MoBT<sub>x</sub> also exhibits the smallest Tafel slope of 26.8 mV dec<sup>-1</sup> (Figure 2c), suggesting more favorable HER kinetics. This small Tafel slope indicates that Ni/MoBT, follows a Volmer-Tafel pathway, with the Tafel reaction as the ratedetermining step.<sup>[20]</sup> This also indicates the accelerated Volmer step and reverse hydrogen spillover due to the dual-site design of Ni/MoBT<sub>x</sub>.<sup>[21]</sup> It is worth mentioning that the small overpotential ( $\eta_{10} = 32 \text{ mV}$ ) and Tafel slope (26.8 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>) of Ni/MoBT<sub>x</sub> are advanced among the currently reported Ni-based HER catalysts in alkaline media (Figure 2d and Table S1, Supporting Information).[22]

The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis was carried out to further probe the HER kinetics. The resulting Nyquist plots (Figure \$14, Supporting Information), after equivalent circuit fitting, reveal that the Ni/MoBT, catalyst exhibits the smallest charge-transfer resistance ( $R_{ct}$ ) of 7.1  $\Omega$  (Figure S15: Table S2, Supporting Information), reflecting its fast interfacial electron transfer kinetics. In addition, the electrochemical double-layer capacitance ( $C_{\rm dl}$ ), was investigated through cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves measured in the non-Faraday region (Figure \$16, Supporting Information). As shown in Figure 2e, the  $C_{\rm dl}$  of Ni/MoBT<sub>x</sub> is determined to be 24.49 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>, which is much higher than those of MoBT<sub>x</sub> (5.57 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>), Ni/GO (16.17 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>), and Ni (6.27 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>), while below that of 20% Pt/C (44.05 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>). The corresponding electrochemical surface area (ECSA) value of the catalyst is calculated to study the source of the superior activity of the synthesized catalyst, with calculation details provided in Supporting Information. As shown in Figure S17 (Supporting Information), compared with MoBT<sub>x</sub> (140.0 cm<sup>2</sup>) and Ni (152.5 cm<sup>2</sup>), the ECSA of Ni/MoBT, is as high as 612.5 cm<sup>2</sup>, indicating that the incorporation of Ni increases the ECSA by generating additional interfacial active sites on the MoBT<sub>x</sub> support. Remarkably, despite its lower  $C_{dl}$  than Pt/C, Ni/MoBT<sub>x</sub> delivers comparable HER activity, implying higher intrinsic activity per electrochemical surface area. This is further demonstrated by the leading specific activity of Ni/MoBT, when normalized by  $C_{\rm dl}$  (Figure S18, Supporting Information), underscoring its superior catalytic efficiency. From an overall perspective, Ni/MoBT<sub>x</sub> shows excellent

catalytic activity in the alkaline HER process (Figure 2f). In comparison, a physically mixed Ni+MoBT $_x$  (detailed in Supporting Information), exhibited much lower HER activity (Figure S19, Supporting Information), highlighting that the superior performance originates from interfacial interactions rather than simple mixing.

Beyond activity, electrocatalytic durability represents another important criterion in determining the practical application potential of a catalyst. Long-term chronoamperometry at the potential of -32 mV vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) was performed to monitor the stability of Ni/MoBT<sub>r</sub>. As shown in Figure 2g, Ni/MoBT, maintains a stable current density over 100 h of continuous operation. In contrast, the current density of commercial Pt/C at -39 mV significantly decreased from 10 to 6.6 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> within just 48 h (Figure S20, Supporting Information). In addition, the post-test LSV curve of Ni/MoBT<sub>x</sub> shows negligible deviation from the initial (Figure 2h), confirming its superior stability during the HER catalytic process. Consistent with its electrochemical durability, post-HER XRD shows only a slight decrease in Ni peak intensity, while the peak shape remains essentially unchanged, indicating the crystalline framework of Ni/MoBT, is well preserved (Figure S21, Supporting Informa-

#### 2.3. Mechanistic Insights into Dual-Site Synergy for HER

## 2.3.1. Electronic Structure Modulation and Hydrogen Adsorption

As previously discussed, an effective alkaline HER electrocatalyst should both facilitate water dissociation and possess optimal hydrogen adsorption energy. To understand the origin of the superior HER activity of Ni/MoBT, we first investigated the electronic structure modulation in Ni/MoBT, focusing on its influence on tuning hydrogen binding strength. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was employed to investigate the chemical environment and electronic structure of Ni nanoparticles deposited on  $MoBT_x$ . The survey spectrum confirms the coexistence of C, B, O, Mo, and Ni elements in the Ni/MoBT<sub>x</sub> hybrid (Figure S22, Supporting Information). The high-resolution Ni 2p spectrum (**Figure 3a**) exhibits peaks for Ni<sup>0</sup> at 852.61 eV  $(2p_{3/2})$  and 869.84 eV  $(2p_{1/2})$ , [23] and for Ni<sup>2+</sup> at 856.72 eV  $(2p_{3/2})$ and 874.13 eV  $(2p_{1/2})$ , [24] along with shake-up satellite peaks at 862.44 eV and 879.85 eV. Notably, the Ni $^{0}$  2 $p_{3/2}$  peak of Ni/MoBT $_{x}$ exhibits a 0.23 eV positive shift compared to metallic Ni, suggesting electron depletion on Ni induced by interfacial interaction with the support. In contrast, Ni/GO displays a more pronounced binding energy shift and a higher proportion of Ni<sup>2+</sup> species, likely due to the strong electron-withdrawing nature of oxygen functional groups in GO, as opposed to the relatively low electronegativity of B and Mo in MoBT<sub>x</sub>. As shown in Table S3 (Supporting Information), Ni/MoBT, contains a higher Ni<sup>0</sup> fraction than Ni/GO, evidencing the weaker electron-withdrawing effect of MoBT<sub>x</sub>.

The Mo 3d spectrum of Ni/MoBT<sub>x</sub> (Figure 3b) shows peaks attributed to Mo in the MBene framework (228.41 and 231.41 eV), Mo<sup>4+</sup> (229.80 and 233.16 eV), and Mo<sup>6+</sup> (231.96 and 235.33 eV), [25] indicating the presence of mixed-valence states likely associated with surface terminations. Compared with pristine

 $MoBT_x$ , all Mo 3*d* peaks in Ni/MoBT<sub>x</sub> shift negatively, further supporting the electron transfer from Ni to MoBT<sub>x</sub>.

The O 1s spectrum (Figure 3c) displays three components centered at 530.70, 531.88, and 533.10 eV, corresponding to metal-oxygen bonds, oxygen vacancies, and adsorbed H2O, respectively. [26] Compared to MoBT, all O 1s peaks in Ni/MoBT, shift to lower binding energies, suggesting an increased electron density on O atoms upon Ni integration. The B 1s spectrum (Figure 3d) shows peaks at 187.90 and 192.50 eV, assigned to metal-boron and B-O species, respectively.<sup>[27]</sup> In contrast to O 1s, both B 1s peaks in Ni/MoBT<sub>x</sub> exhibit positive binding energy shifts relative to MoBT, implying electron depletion on B atoms. These findings imply that B may act as an electron donor to partially compensate the electron loss in Ni, thereby optimizing the electronic structure of Ni sites. Furthermore, Post-HER XPS (Figure \$23, Supporting Information) analysis shows essentially unchanged Ni 2p and Mo 3d spectra, confirming stable interfacial electronic structure during electrocatalysis.

Building upon the above results, X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) was conducted to further investigate the electronic states and coordination structures in Ni/MoBT<sub>x</sub>. The Ni K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectrum (Figure 3e) shows that the absorption edge of Ni/MoBT, locates between those of Ni foil and NiO, and closer to the former, indicating that Ni primarily exists in a metallic state.<sup>[24]</sup> Compared with Ni/GO, Ni/MoBT, exhibits a smaller positive shift from Ni foil, suggesting a more moderate electron transfer from Ni, which agrees well with the XPS analyses. The Fourier-transformed extended X-ray absorption fine structure (FT-EXAFS) spectrum at the Ni K-edge (Figure 3f) reveals a dominant peak at ~2.17 Å, assigned to Ni-Ni coordination, closely matching Ni foil (2.15 Å) and differing from Ni—O and Ni—O—Ni bonds.<sup>[28]</sup> The absence of oxide-related features also confirms the metallic nature of Ni in Ni/MoBT<sub>x</sub>. Consistently, wavelet transform (WT) analysis (Figure S24, Supporting Information) shows a maximum intensity at 7.8  $Å^{-1}$  in k-space, corresponding to Ni-Ni bonding. Meanwhile, the Mo K-edge XANES spectrum of Ni/MoBT, reveals that the Mo oxidation state lies between 0 and +4, further supporting the mixed-valence character of Mo in the hybrid (Figure \$25, Supporting Information).

To provide theoretical support for the experimentally observed charge transfer and to explore its effect on hydrogen adsorption, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed on pristine Ni, Ni/MoBT $_x$  and Ni/GO (Figure 3g; Figure S26, Supporting Information). Charge density difference plots (Figure 3h) illustrate electron transfer from Ni to MoBT $_x$ , mediated by Ni *d*-orbitals and O *p*-orbitals. For Ni/GO, the high oxygen content in the GO support induces a stronger electron-withdrawing effect on interfacial Ni atoms. Quantitatively, Bader charge analysis reflects a reduced charge accumulation on Ni atoms in Ni/MoBT $_x$  ( $\sim$ 0.18 e) relative to Ni/GO ( $\sim$ 0.33 e). This aligns well with the experimental observation that the presence of B optimizes the charge transfer process and mitigates the overoxidation of Ni.

This interfacial electronic modulation has a direct impact on the Ni d-band structure, which in turn influences hydrogen adsorption behavior and ultimately affects HER activity. According to the projected density of states (PDOS) analysis, the Ni d-band center shifts from -1.06 eV in pristine Ni to -1.32 eV in Ni/MoBT<sub>x</sub>, and to -1.52 eV in Ni/GO (Figure 3i). The intermedi-

ate value observed for Ni/MoBT, indicates a moderate electronic modulation that is expected to weaken the overly strong hydrogen binding while preserving HER catalytic activity.<sup>[29]</sup> In contrast, the stronger downshift in Ni/GO may leads to excessively weak hydrogen affinity due to reduced orbital overlap. These inferences are supported by the calculated Gibbs free energy of hydrogen adsorption ( $\Delta G_{H*}$ , Figure 3j; Figure S27, Supporting Information). Pristine Ni binds hydrogen too strongly (-0.48 eV), while Ni/GO binds too weakly (0.62 eV) due to excessive electron depletion at Ni sites. In comparison, Ni/MoBT, achieves a nearthermoneutral  $\Delta G_{H^*}$  of -0.12 eV, representing a favorable balance between hydrogen adsorption and desorption. These results highlight that the dual-site heterostructure design of Ni/MoBT, enables finely tuned hydrogen adsorption through moderate electronic modulation at the Ni-MoBT, interface, which is crucial for promoting the Tafel step on Ni sites, and also facilitates the reverse hydrogen spillover process discussed below.

#### 2.3.2. Characterization of Reverse Hydrogen Spillover

A central concept in our dual-site heterostructure design is the spatial separation of reaction functions, wherein the support promotes the Volmer reaction while Ni serves as the active sites for Tafel reaction. Reverse hydrogen spillover from the support to Ni is therefore a key mechanistic link between these two steps. Having established that Ni sites offer a favorable electronic environment for H<sub>2</sub> generation in the Tafel step, we next turn to experimental investigations of the proposed reverse hydrogen spillover process. First, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was employed to measure the work function ( $\Phi$ ) of the catalysts and their supports, which critically influences hydrogen spillover dynamics.<sup>[30]</sup> As illustrated in Figure 4a,b, the work function difference between Ni and MoBT, is only 0.06 eV, markedly smaller than the 0.27 eV difference observed for the Ni/GO interface. A smaller  $\Phi$  mismatch reduces the interfacial energy barrier and suppresses excessive local charge accumulation, thereby providing a more favorable pathway for H migration across the interface and facilitating efficient hydrogen spillover between Ni and  $\text{MoBT}_{\text{\tiny r}}.^{[31]}$ 

Hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction ( $H_2$ -TPR) was then used to investigate the catalysts' redox properties and further examine the reverse hydrogen spillover process. Theoretically, hydrogen atoms transferred from the MoBT $_x$  support to Ni via reverse spillover are expected to promote Ni reduction while suppressing that of the support. As shown in Figure 4c and Figure S28 (Supporting Information), the  $H_2$ -TPR reduction peak for MoBT $_x$  appears at 446 °C, while high-valence nickel is reduced at 412 °C. In the Ni/MoBT $_x$  composite, two peaks are observed: one at 395 °C (high-valence nickel reduction) and another at 491 °C (support reduction). The shifted reduction temperatures of Ni and MoBT $_x$  relative to their monocomponents are consistent with the reverse hydrogen spillover mechanism.

To further probe interfacial hydrogen adsorption behavior and validate the presence of hydrogen spillover, in situ EIS analysis was performed for Ni/MoBT<sub>x</sub>, MoBT<sub>x</sub>, and Ni/GO at varying overpotentials (Figure 4d; Figure S29, Supporting Information).

parallel elements  $C_{\varphi}$  and  $R_2$  reflecting surface hydrogen adsorption processes. Specifically,  $C_{\varphi}$  corresponds to the hydrogen adsorption pseudo-capacitance, while  $R_2$  represents the adsorption resistance. By integrating  $C_{\varphi}$  over the overpotential  $(\eta)$ , the surface hydrogen adsorption charge  $(Q_{\rm H})$  can be quantitatively extracted. As shown in Figure 4e, Ni/MoBT $_x$  displays a  $Q_{\rm H}$  nearly 1.7 times and 3.6 times greater than those of MoBT $_x$  and Ni/GO, respectively, indicating significantly enhanced hydrogen adsorption capability. The low  $Q_{\rm H}$  of Ni/GO reflects its weak H adsorption, consistent with its excessively downshifted d-band center. Furthermore, the kinetics of hydrogen adsorption on the catalyst are evaluated by Tafel slopes derived from the EIS data. These slopes are obtained by linearly fitting log  $R_2$  against the overpotential. The fitted slopes reveal that Ni/MoBT $_x$  (64.4 mV dec $^{-1}$ ) exhibits markedly faster adsorption kinetics than MoBT $_x$  (135.8

mV dec<sup>-1</sup>) (Figure 4f), suggesting the promoted hydrogen transfer from  $MoBT_x$  to Ni in the heterostructure.<sup>[34]</sup> Moreover, the relatively high Tafel slope (98.4 mV dec-1) of Ni/GO again highlights its insufficient hydrogen adsorption capacity.

In addition, the hydrogen desorption behavior on the catalyst offers a complementary perspective for probing the hydrogen spillover. CV measurements were performed to detect the hydrogen desorption peaks of Ni/MoBT<sub>x</sub>, MoBT<sub>x</sub> and Ni/GO (Figure 4g; Figure S30, Supporting Information). At a given scan rate, the hydrogen desorption peak of Ni/MoBT<sub>x</sub> is markedly higher compared to MoBT<sub>x</sub> and Ni/GO (Figure 4h), indicating enhanced hydrogen desorption capability on Ni/MoBT<sub>x</sub>. As the scan rate increases, the hydrogen desorption peak shifts positively due to kinetic limitations, which require higher overpotentials to match fast potential changes. The extent of this shift,

quantified by the slope from the linear fit of peak potential versus scan rate, reflects the desorption kinetics. A smaller slope corresponds to faster hydrogen release. As illustrated in Figure 4i, Ni/MoBT<sub>x</sub> exhibits a significantly smaller slope  $(4.1 \times 10^{-4})$  than  $MoBT_x$  (6.9 × 10<sup>-4</sup>), indicating more rapid hydrogen desorption kinetics. This enhancement can be attributed to reverse hydrogen spillover from MoBT, to Ni, as hydrogen species generated on MoBT, migrate to Ni sites for efficient desorption.[35] Moreover, the largest slope of Ni/GO (1.5  $\times$  10<sup>-3</sup>) may originate from its limited water splitting ability and lack of spillover pathways. In summary, these experimental results demonstrate that the surface hydrogen formed via water dissociation on MoBT, undergoes reverse spillover to Ni. Combining with the optimal hydrogen binding on Ni, this interfacial synergy establishes the mechanistic basis for the dual-site heterostructure design and accounts for the observed activity enhancement.

## 2.3.3. Theoretical Elucidation of the Reaction Pathway

To gain molecular-level insights into the HER mechanism on Ni/MoBT<sub>x</sub>, DFT calculations were performed to identify the active sites and reaction pathways. Energy barriers for the Volmer step were first examined (**Figure 5a**; Figures S31–S33, Supporting Information). As predicted, the calculated energy barriers for O—H bond cleavage is higher on pristine Ni surface (1.18 eV) than on MoBT<sub>x</sub> (0.62 eV), quantitatively supporting their respective weak and strong water dissociation behaviors. In the Ni/MoBT<sub>x</sub> hybrid, the Ni site shows an increased energy barrier of 1.25 eV, while the barrier at the Mo site decreases to only 0.13 eV, suggesting that the interfacial electronic modulation strengthens water dissociation ability of MoBT<sub>x</sub>, and confirming that water dissociation preferentially occurs on MoBT<sub>x</sub>.

Hydrogen adsorption free energies ( $\Delta G_{\rm H*}$ ) were calculated for various sites on Ni/MoBT $_x$  and MoBT $_x$  (Figure 5b,c; Figure S34, Supporting Information). Pristine MoBT $_x$  strongly binds hydrogen (-1.02 eV), hindering its surface diffusion and desorption. After Ni incorporation,  $\Delta G_{\rm H*}$  at Mo1 site becomes less negative (-0.70 eV), moderately weakening H\* interaction. Along the spillover migration path,  $\Delta G_{\rm H*}$  further reduces at Mo2 (-0.63 eV), Ni1 (-0.30 eV), and Ni2 (-0.12 eV) sites. The stepwise decrease in  $\Delta G_{\rm H*}$  ensures a low-barrier migration pathway for H\* spillover toward Ni2 site, where the near-thermoneutral  $\Delta G_{\rm H*}$  provides ideal conditions for H $_2$  evolution.

Based on the above analyses, we propose a dual-site catalytic mechanism featured by spatial separation of water activation and hydrogen evolution, with reverse hydrogen spillover serving as the key bridge between the two steps (Figure 5d), involving: 1) water molecules adsorb and dissociate at Mo sites to generate H\*, 2) H\* migrates to adjacent Ni sites via spillover, and 3)  $H_2$  forms and desorbs from Ni. Figure 5e further quantifies this pathway. Given that the favorable adsorption and dissociation energetics of  $H_2O$  at Mo sites, water activation preferentially occurs on the Mo component of the heterostructure. Following H\* generation, its migration from the Mo site to a neighboring Ni atom requires only 0.36 eV, and the final desorption step occurs with a low barrier of 0.12 eV. By contrast, direct  $H_2$  desorption from the Mo2 site without spillover requires a significantly higher barrier of 0.56 eV. Collectively, these calculations reflect that the reverse hydrogen

spillover bridges the spatially separated functions of Mo and Ni, establishing a kinetically favorable pathway for HER.

In summary, experimental and theoretical results jointly support the dual-site catalytic mechanism of  $\mathrm{Ni/MoBT}_x$ .  $\mathrm{MoBT}_x$  efficiently activates water,  $\mathrm{Ni}$  optimally binds and releases hydrogen, and a low-barrier reverse hydrogen spillover pathway effectively couples these two functions. This design resolves the intrinsic conflict between Volmer and Tafel steps on single-site catalysts in alkaline media, offering a mechanistic foundation for developing advanced HER electrocatalysts.

## 2.4. Beyond HER: HOR Activity and Mechanistic Understanding

As the reverse reaction of HER, HOR is a key process in energy devices such as fuel cells, and involves intermediates similar to those in HER. Therefore, the HOR performance of Ni/MoBT, was also investigated to demonstrate the versatility of the heterostructure design in enabling multiple electrochemical functions. HOR measurements were carried out in H<sub>2</sub>-saturated 0.1 M KOH. Among the series of Ni/MoBT, hybrids reduced at different temperatures, the sample treated at 350 °C displayed the highest HOR activity (Figure \$35, Supporting Information), consistent with the trend observed in HER. As shown in the polarization curves measured at a rotation rate of 1600 rpm and a scan rate of 1 mV s<sup>-1</sup> (**Figure 6a**), Ni/MoBT<sub>x</sub> achieves a current density of 2.51 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> at the overpotential of 0.1 V, closely approaching that of commercial Pt/C (2.66 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>), demonstrating its excellent HOR activity. In contrast, Ni, Ni/GO, and MoBT, show significantly lower activity, highlighting the critical role of the interfacial coupling in Ni/MoBT<sub>x</sub>.

To further probe the intrinsic HOR kinetics of Ni/MoBT<sub>x</sub>, polarization curves were recorded at varying rotation rates ranging from 400 to 2500 rpm (Figure 6b). The corresponding Koutecký-Levich (K–L) analysis at 50 mV vs. RHE yields a linear plot of  $j^{-1}$ versus  $\omega^{-1/2}$  (Figure 6c). The fitted slope is 4.97 cm<sup>2</sup> mA<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1/2</sup>, closely matching the theoretical value of 4.87 cm $^{2}$  mA $^{-1}$  s $^{-1/2}$  for a two-electron HOR process, suggesting diffusion-limited kinetics and efficient charge transfer. The intercept allows determination of the kinetic current density  $(j_k)$ , which is calculated to be 4.92 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> at 50 mV. Additionally, the  $j_k$  and mass-normalized kinetic current density ( $j_{k,m} = 60.29 \text{ mA mg}_{Ni}^{-1}$ ) outperform most Ni-based HOR catalysts (Figure 6e and Tables S4 and S5, Supporting Information).[36] Meanwhile, based on the approximate equation of Equation S7 (Supporting Information), the exchange current densities of the samples in Figure 6d are fitted in the micropolarization region of -15 to 15 mV, as shown in Figure \$36 (Supporting Information). The exchange current density of  $Ni/MoBT_x$  is 1.23 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, surpassing Ni, Ni/GO, and MoBT<sub>x</sub>, indicating superior intrinsic activity (Figure \$37, Supporting Information). Accelerated durability tests (ADT) on Ni/MoBT, over 4000 cycles (Figure 6f) show minimal degradation at 0.12 V, confirming its excellent stability under HOR conditions. This result underscores the promise of Ni/MoBT<sub>x</sub> as an efficient and robust HOR electrocatalyst for alkaline hydrogen fuel cell applications.

To gain further insights into the enhanced HOR activity, DFT calculations were performed to examine the intermediate free energies of Ni/MoBT<sub>x</sub>, Ni, and Ni/GO. Given that the HOR is the reverse of HER and involves hydrogen adsorption (H\*), the

hydrogen adsorption free energy remains a valuable descriptor for evaluating alkaline HOR activity, with values approaching zero generally correlating with faster kinetics.[\[36h\]](#page-12-0) As shown in Figure [6g,](#page-10-0) Ni/MoBT*<sup>x</sup>* exhibits a hydrogen adsorption free energy of −0.12 eV, closer to thermoneutral compared to Ni (−0.48 eV) and Ni/GO (0.62 eV), thereby offering theoretical support for its superior HOR activity.

Although different viewpoints exist, the water formation step (Volmer step, H\* + OH<sup>−</sup> → H2O + e<sup>−</sup>) is generally considered the rate-determining step for alkaline HOR. Recent studies suggest that enhanced OH\* binding could promote the electro-oxidative removal of H\*, thereby accelerating the Volmer step in the HOR process.[\[37\]](#page-12-0) Thus, the binding energy of OH\* (OHBE) serves as another key indicator for describing the HOR activity. As shown in Figure [6h](#page-10-0) and Figure S38 (Supporting Information), OH\* exhibits stronger adsorption on Ni/MoBT*<sup>x</sup>* (−0.10 eV) than on Ni (0.56 eV) and Ni/GO (0.82 eV). These findings suggest that the sluggish water formation step (Volmer step) in HOR on Ni

nanoparticles can be effectively accelerated by the presence of  $MoBT_{x}$ , leading to the enhancement of the alkaline HOR electrocatalytic performance.

Overall, the  $Ni/MoBT_x$  heterostructure not only boosts HER through the dual-site mechanism, but also enhances HOR by interfacial electronic regulation, enabling efficient bifunctional hydrogen electrocatalysis.

#### 3. Conclusion

In summary, we demonstrate the construction of a heterostructure consisting of metallic Ni and  $MoBT_x$  MBene that delivers outstanding bifunctional activity for alkaline hydrogen evolution and oxidation reactions. Ni/MoBT<sub>x</sub> achieves a notably low HER

overpotential of 32 mV at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, outperforming most reported Ni-based catalysts. Combined experimental and theoretical analyses reveal that the superior performance arises from a dual-site design strategy that spatially separates and simultaneously accelerates Volmer and Tafel steps. Electron transfer from Ni to Mo induces charge redistribution, resulting in favorable water activation and H\* generation on Mo sites, along with balanced hydrogen adsorption and desorption on Ni sites. An efficient reverse hydrogen spillover process from MoBT<sub>x</sub> to Ni is also confirmed, which serves as a critical link that enables the overall HER process. Beyond HER, Ni/MoBT<sub>x</sub> also exhibits excellent HOR activity through interfacial electronic modulation that finely tunes the H and OH binding energy. As a result, Ni/MoBT<sub>x</sub> achieves a mass activity of 60.29 mA mg<sub>Ni</sub><sup>-1</sup> at 50 mV, surpassing most

<span id="page-11-0"></span>state-of-the-art Ni-based HOR catalysts. This work establishes an interfacial design principle to overcome the challenges in alkaline hydrogen electrocatalysis, and highlights the potential of MBenes as functional supports for high-performance electrocatalysts.

**Efficient bifunctional hydrogen electrocatalysis, encompassing both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR), is of paramount significance in advancing hydrogen-based societies. While non-precious-metal-based catalysts, particularly those based on nickel (Ni), are essential for alkaline HER/HOR, their intrinsic catalytic activity often falls short of expectations. Herein, an internal electric field (IEF) strategy is introduced for the engineering of heterogeneous nickel-vanadium oxide nanosheet arrays grown on porous nickel foam (Ni-V2O3/PNF) as bifunctional electrocatalysts for hydrogen electrocatalysis. Strikingly, the Ni-V2O3/PNF delivers 10 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> at an overpotential of 54 mV for HER and a mass-specific kinetic current of 19.3 A g<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> at an overpotential of 50 mV for HOR, placing it on par with the benchmark 20% Pt/C, while exhibiting enhanced stability in alkaline electrolytes. Density functional theory calculations, in conjunction with experimental characterizations, unveil that the interface IEF effect fosters asymmetrical charge distributions, which results in more thermoneutral hydrogen adsorption Gibbs free energy on the electron-deficient Ni side, thus elevating the overall efficiency of both HER and HOR. The discoveries reported herein guidance are provided for further understanding and designing efficient non-precious-metal-based electrocatalysts through the IEF strategy.**

reaction (HER) driven by electric energy, especially from green technologies (e.g., wind, solar), has been considered the most ideal approach for high-purity hydrogen generation.[\[3,4\]](#page-10-0) In addition, considering the practical hydrogen economy, the efficient hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) has also received considerable attention as it is vital for the conversion efficiency of hydrogen fuel cells. As the reversible reactions, HER and HOR share the same critical intermediates of adsorbed hydrogen (H\*). To date, platinum (Pt) and Ptbased alloy catalysts are state-of-the-art electrocatalysts toward both HER and HOR, whereas their unfavorable cost and limited reserve severely hinder their large-scale applications.[\[5,6\]](#page-10-0) In recent years, there has been a growing surge of interest in alkaline electrolyzers and alkaline fuel cells, attributed to their reduced operational costs and enhanced energy conversion efficiencies. This has spurred a fervent quest for efficient electrocatalysts tailored to the alkaline environment.[\[7\]](#page-10-0) However, it is regrettable that the HER/HOR rates on Pt exhibit orders of magnitude reduction in alkaline

solutions compared to their performance in acidic settings, significantly diminishing Pt's competitive advantage over alternative materials.[\[8,9\]](#page-10-0) Consequently, there exists a compelling incentive to engineer platinum group metal (PGM)-free electrocatalysts that can attain commensurate catalytic activities in alkaline media while remaining notably cost-effective in contrast to their precious metal counterparts.

Up to date, nickel (Ni)-based materials stand as the sole viable PGM-free candidates for catalyzing the alkaline HOR.[\[10\]](#page-10-0) Computational simulations have unveiled that pristine nickel exhibits limited HER and HOR activities, primarily attributable to its pronounced surface affinity for \*H species. Furthermore, pristine nickel (Ni) falls short in its aptitude to promote the dissociation and formation of H2O, which are often regarded as the ratedetermining steps for alkaline HER and HOR.[\[11,12\]](#page-10-0) Numerous strategies have been proposed to amend the electronic configuration of nickel, thereby modulating its interaction with reaction intermediates. These approaches encompass alloying with diverse metals or nonmetals,[\[13,14\]](#page-10-0) surface modification with metal

oxides,[\[15,16\]](#page-10-0) and coupling with conductive supports.[\[17,18\]](#page-10-0) Experimental and computational investigations have unveiled the pivotal role of surface charge distribution in determining the adsorption characteristics of reaction intermediates on catalyst surface, and subsequently, and thus in regulating electron-deficient and electron-rich regions of active sites.[\[19,20\]](#page-10-0) Specifically, catalysts endowed with a negatively charged surface tend to favor the adsorption of electron-deficient H atoms in water, thereby facilitating subsequent water dissociation.[\[21\]](#page-10-0) In contrast, a positively charged metallic nickel surface can hinder the bond interaction between Ni-H, consequently impeding the facile desorption of hydrogen.[\[14\]](#page-10-0) For instance, Hu et al. developed the Ni3N/C catalyst with excellent alkaline HOR performance, in which interfacial charge transfer from Ni3N to the carbon support.[\[17\]](#page-10-0) This alteration in surface electron distribution results in the weakening of binding energies associated with hydrogen and oxygen species, thus enhancing the electrocatalytic performance. Consequently, there exists an urgent imperative to develop a precise strategy that facilitates controlled electron transfer among various active species.

The strategic integration of disparate hetero components, each characterized by distinct Fermi levels, to construct an internal electric field (IEF) represents a compelling avenue for tailoring the electronic structure of active sites and orchestrating the adsorption affinities of pivotal reaction intermediates.[\[22\]](#page-10-0) One noteworthy example of utilizing the IEF strategy is demonstrated by He et al., who ingeniously established a p-n junction between the negatively charged CoP region and the positively charged FeNi layered double hydroxides (LDHs) region, resulting in a substantial enhancement of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance.[\[23\]](#page-10-0) In a similar consideration, Zhao et al. reported that the built-in electric field at the nickel phosphide-cobalt nanowire arrays (Ni2P-CoCH) can effectively augment the electrochemical active surface area and enhance the number of active sites, which ultimately promotes both HER and OER.[\[24\]](#page-10-0) Very recently, Yin et al. reported an impressive case of FeN/Fe3N interface with enhanced IEF for electrochemical reduction of CO2 to CO, wherein electron transfers from Fe3N to FeN and the negatively charged FeN facilitates the CO2 adsorption and reduction to \*COOH.[\[25\]](#page-10-0) Typically, the spontaneously generated IEF in such systems leads to the efficient separation of oppositely charged species, enabling their directed migration in divergent directions across the interface. This promotes local charge polarization and asymmetrical charge distributions on hetero components or active sites, thereby enhancing the adsorption of hydrogen and oxygen intermediates.[\[26\]](#page-10-0) Nevertheless, it is important to recognize that coupling nickel with other building blocks, particularly oxides, can result in the confinement of charge carriers.[\[27\]](#page-10-0) The overlap of the electron cloud at the metal-oxygen interface may lead to electrons being trapped within the metal, while protons remain confined to the oxide. Consequently, the orientation of the IEF may become less predictable and its strength may diminish.[\[28\]](#page-10-0) It is noteworthy that the difference in work function (ΔΦ) between different components provides an intrinsic driving force for the transport and orientation of charges across the interfaces.[\[29,30\]](#page-10-0) In light of the aforementioned discussions, it is both practical and anticipated to adjust the adsorption behavior of hydrogen and oxygen species through the deliberate selection of building blocks with suitable ΔΦ, thereby facilitating the

construction and manipulation of IEF. In addition, an in-depth exploration of the mechanistic connection between intermediate adsorption behavior and interfacial IEF holds paramount significance for the advancement of both the HER and HOR. It demonstrates the critical importance of rationally designing efficient bifunctional catalysts for hydrogen electrocatalysis.

In this investigation, we have effectively integrated Ni nanoparticles into V2O3 nanosheet arrays grown on porous nickel foam (Ni-V2O3/PNF) through meticulous control of the continuous hydrothermal and thermal-reduction processes, yielding a bifunctional catalyst capable of promoting both the HER and the HOR in alkaline media. A suite of spectroscopic characterizations, in conjunction with theoretical insights, corroborates the preparation of a catalyst featuring a substantial difference in work function (ΔΦ), a property that facilitates electron transfer from Ni to V2O3, culminating in the establishment of a robust and enduring IEF at the interfaces. Specially, the Ni-V2O3/PNF catalyst attains 10 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> at a remarkably low overpotential of 54 mV for HER in 1.0 m KOH, and concurrently exhibits a mass-specific kinetic current of 19.3 A g<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> for HOR at the overpotential of 50 mV in 0.1 m KOH, all while maintaining commendable stability. Employing density functional theory (DFT), we discern that the interfacial IEF, featuring asymmetrical charge distribution, affords a thermoneutral Gibbs free energy for hydrogen adsorption on the electron-deficient Ni side, thereby amplifying the efficiency of both the HER and HOR. Furthermore, the electronegative character of V2O3 contributes to the destabilization of surface-bound water molecules, thereby expediting their adsorption and dissociation. These concerted effects cumulatively culminate in the substantial improvement of HER activity. The outcomes of this investigation unveil a promising trajectory for the rational design of high-performance bifunctional electrocatalysts tailored for hydrogen evolution and oxidation reactions, by means of the precision engineering and manipulation of internal electric fields.

### **2. Results and Discussion**

#### **2.1. Materials Preparation and Characterization**

As depicted in **Figure 1**[a,](#page-2-0) the synthesis of the Ni-V2O3/PNF catalyst involves a two-step route. In the first step, Ni-V-O nanosheet arrays with a smooth surface are grown on porous nickel foam substrates, hereafter referred to as Ni-V-O/PNF, through a straightforward hydrothermal pathway. The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern presented in Figure S1a (Supporting Information) reveals that the Ni-V-O precursor primarily comprises nickel-based hydroxides and hydroxy-carbonates. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images (Figure S1b,c, Supporting Information) confirm the uniform growth of nanosheet arrays on the nickel foam, and energy dispersive spectroscopy element mapping (Figure S2, Supporting Information) provides empirical evidence that the Ni-V-O precursor primarily consists of Ni, V, and O element. Upon subsequent low-temperature reduction at 400°C in 10%H2/Ar atmosphere, Ni-V2O3/PNF spontaneously forms, as schematically shown in Figure [1a.](#page-2-0) The powder XRD pattern of Ni-V2O3/PNF (scratched from Ni-V2O3/PNF to eliminate the influence of PNF, labeled as Ni-V2O3-400) in Figure [1b](#page-2-0) shows the characteristic peaks located at 44.5°, 51.8°, and 76.4° (2), which assign to the (111), (200), and

(220) crystal planes of Ni (JCPDS # 04–0850). Simultaneously, peaks located at 24.3°, 33.0°, 36.3°, and 53.9° (2) correspond to the (012), (104), (110), and (116) crystal planes of V2O3 (JCPDS # 65–9474), thereby underscoring the successful formation of the Ni-V2O3 heterostructure interface. No discernible signals stemming from other materials are observed. It is noteworthy to mention that the reduction in temperature exerts a considerable influence on the crystal structure of the resultant materials. As seen from the XRD pattern in Figure 1b, an increase in the reduction temperature to 300°C yields exclusively broad diffraction peaks attributed to NiO (JCPDS # 44–1159). However, elevating the temperature to 400°C results in distinct diffraction peaks corresponding to both Ni and V2O3. This identical phase structure is maintained when the annealing temperature is raised to 500°C.

The field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) image of Ni-V2O3/PNF in Figure 1c,d unveils the highly oriented and vertically rooted configuration of Ni-V2O3 nanosheets on the porous nickel foam. These nanosheets exhibit rough surfaces and encompass numerous void spaces. This unique nanosheet architecture, as reported in the literature,[\[31,32\]](#page-10-0) possesses a remarkable capillary force, facilitating the infiltration of electrolytes into active sites and concurrently driving away the gas bubbles generated during catalysis. This dynamic interplay leads to a pronounced enhancement in electrocatalytic activity. For an in-depth examination of the intricate nanostructure of the Ni-V2O3 nanosheets, both transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning TEM (STEM) were employed. Figure 1e and Figure S3 (Supporting Information) exhibit the multi-dimensionally assembled nanostructure of Ni-V2O3 nanosheets. These nanosheets are constructed by a random distribution of nanoparticles, each possessing an average diameter of ≈20–40 nm. This arrangement contributes to augmented surface roughness, thereby facilitating an exceptionally accessible pathway for the mass transport of reaction intermediates and the removal of gas bubbles. The magnified TEM image (Figure S3, Supporting Information) unveils the intimate incorporation of crystalline nanoparticles into the nanosheets, establishing robust heterointerfaces. The detailed structure of the

Ni-V2O3 interface was analyzed by using high-resolution TEM (HR-TEM). In Figure [1f,g,](#page-2-0) the well-resolved lattice fringes are evident. These fringes exhibit interplanar spacing of 0.247 and 0.203 nm, in agreement with the (110) plane of V2O3 and the (111) plane of Ni, respectively, thus affirming the successful construction of Ni-V2O3 interfaces. This is further corroborated by the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns, as displayed in Figure [1g](#page-2-0) (inset). Additionally, the high-angle annular dark-field scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM) image in Figure [1h,](#page-2-0) along with the accompanying elemental mapping in Figure [1i,](#page-2-0) attests to the heterogeneity of Ni, V, and O elements in Ni-V2O3 heterostructures. The energy-dispersive X-ray spectrum (EDX), as depicted in Figure S4 (Supporting Information), further elucidates that the atomic ratio of V to Ni in the Ni-V2O3 nanosheets is precisely 0.47.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is employed to investigate the chemical valence state and elemental composition of Ni-V2O3/PNF. The powder samples were analyzed after being separated from their nickel foam substrates via ultrasonic treatment. The XPS spectra survey scan (Figure S5, Supporting Information) unequivocally affirms the existence of Ni, V, and O elements within Ni-V2O3/PNF, in agreement with the previously obtained elemental mappings. The Ni 2p spectra (**Figure 2**a) exhibit two distinct peaks corresponding to the Ni 2p3/2 and Ni 2p1/2 contributions. Specially, the Ni 2p3/2 peaks, situated at 852.6 and 855.9 eV, are attributed to the Ni─Ni bond of metallic Ni and Ni<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> of Ni─O bonds, respectively.[\[33,34\]](#page-10-0) The latter peak is likely due to the surface oxidation of Ni in the air atmosphere and the interaction of Ni and O atoms within the Ni-V2O3 heterostructure. Significantly, the binding energy associated with the Ni─Ni bond in Ni-V2O3/PNF displays a positive shift of ≈0.36 eV in comparison to Ni/PNF. This shift is attributed to electron injection from Ni to V2O3, which results in a diminished electron density surrounding Ni atoms in Ni-V2O3/PNF. For the V 2p spectra (Figure 2b), the peaks located at 511–519 eV and 519–528 eV are assigned to V 2p3/2 and V 2p1/2, respectively.[\[35,36\]](#page-10-0) Both peaks exhibit the typical signals assigned to V<sup>3</sup><sup>+</sup> and V<sup>4</sup><sup>+</sup> species. The V 2p spectra show that the main peaks of V<sup>3</sup><sup>+</sup> and V<sup>4</sup><sup>+</sup> in Ni-V2O3/PNF have a clear negative shift compared to pure V2O3, indicating that the V atoms in Ni-V2O3 heterostructure are reduced compared to those in pure V2O3 due to the accepted electrons from Ni at the heterointerface. The shift in binding energies towards positive values can be interpreted as a reduction in charge density surrounding the metal atom, while a shift towards negative values implies an increase in charge density. This finding supports the notion of electron transfer from Ni to V2O3, thus indicating the establishment of an interfacial IEF with electrondeficient Ni sites and electron-rich V species. In particular, the electron-rich V sites are expected to modify the absorption energies of water molecules, thereby augmenting HER performance. Conversely, the electron-deficient Ni atoms are anticipated to favor the adsorption of hydrogen intermediates, thereby enhancing both the HER and HOR performance. Figure 2c shows the O 1s spectrum of Ni-V2O3/PNF, which is fitted into three contributions at 530.1, 531.4, and 532.8 eV, attributed to the bridged oxo group of M─O─M (Ni/V─O), O vacancy, and surface adsorbed O **[www.advancedsciencenews.com](http://www.advancedsciencenews.com) [www.small-journal.com](http://www.small-journal.com)**

(e.g., adsorbed O2 and H2O, surface hydroxyl), respectively.[\[37,38\]](#page-10-0) In contrast, only the typical peaks related to the V─O bond and adsorbed O are observed for the V2O3 sample. To fortify the evidence of electron interaction between Ni and V2O3 in Ni-V2O3/PNF, Raman spectroscopy was performed. As depicted in Figure S6 (Supporting Information), the discernible vibration modes and peaks associated with V─O bonds in Ni-V2O3/PNF confirm the presence of V2O3. Furthermore, the weak peak in the vicinity of 537 cm<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> corroborates the existence of V<sup>3</sup><sup>+</sup> species, thus validating the formation of low-valence V species within Ni-V2O3/PNF.[\[39,40\]](#page-10-0)

The electron transfer between materials in a metalsemiconductor heterostructure is fundamentally linked to the ΔΦ. To elucidate the work function values of both Ni/PNF and V2O3/PNF, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was performed. The resultant Φ values, as illustrated in Figure [2d,](#page-3-0) were quantified to be 4.10 eV for Ni/PNF and 4.87 eV for V2O3/PNF, thereby establishing a notable ΔΦ of 0.77 eV at the Ni-V2O3 interface. The interaction between adsorbates and catalysts is qualitatively elucidated via the d-band center (d) theory. This theory posits that the coupling between the d-band center of electrocatalysts and the valence states of adsorbates exerts a paramount influence on the strength of the interaction. Specifically, the proximity of the d-band center to the Fermi level (*E*f), accompanied by an abundance of unoccupied antibonding states, augments the adsorption strength of reaction intermediates. Consequently, the strategic design of the Ni-V2O3 interface, characterized by a moderate band gap energy, is advantageous for the creation of optimized active sites, fostering the favorable adsorption of hydrogen and oxygen intermediates. Additionally, the energy-band diagram portrayed in Figure [2e](#page-3-0) vividly elucidates that the substantial ΔΦ between Ni and V2O3 begets a driving force for electron transfer, directing electrons from the elevated energy level of Ni to the lower energy level of V2O3. This phenomenon facilitates the establishment of a robust interfacial IEF, with the directional electron flow from Ni to V2O3. [\[29\]](#page-10-0) Such a built-in electronic field serves as a conduit for rapid electron transport, thereby enhancing overall conductivity. Furthermore, the metallic attributes and porous structure of the nickel foam substrate also contribute to an elevated level of conductivity. These advantageous properties collectively enhance the catalytic activity of the Ni-V2O3/PNF catalyst during electrocatalytic reactions. The unidirectional electron transfer depicted in Figure [2f](#page-3-0) effectively regulates charge separation, ultimately generating electron-rich V2O3 regions and electron-deficient Ni regions. This dynamic configuration favors the simultaneous and advantageous adsorption of both oxygen and hydrogen intermediates, thereby bolstering catalytic activity.

#### **2.2. Electrocatalytic Performance**

The electrochemical activity of the prepared electrocatalysts is meticulously evaluated through a standard three-electrode system immersed in a 1.0 m KOH solution. To establish a benchmark for the HER and facilitate comparison, a commercial 20% Pt/C catalyst was loaded onto PNF with an optimized mass loading of 4.0 mg cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> (Figure S7, Supporting Information). Notably, the inherent self-supported structure of Ni-V2O3/PNF permits its direct deployment as the working electrode for HER testing. The current density of the working electrode was determined by normalizing its geometric area to 1 cm2. As discerned in **Figure 3**[a,](#page-5-0) Ni-V2O3/PNF presents a superlative HER catalytic performance, closely rivaling that of 20% Pt/C and surpassing those of Ni/PNF and V2O3/PNF. Conspicuously, minimal overpotentials of 54 and 151 mV for Ni-V2O3/PNF are requisite to achieve current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> for HER, respectively. These values are substantially lower than those of Ni/PNF and V2O3/PNF and are comparable to the performance of 20% Pt/C (36 mV and 139 mV). This result demonstrates that HER activity is substantially improved by engineering the IEF. The Tafel slope, an indicator employed to delineate HER kinetics, indicates favorable reaction kinetics when it assumes a small value. Notably, the Tafel plot for Ni-V2O3/PNF gives a Tafel slope of 41.3 mV dec<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> (Figure [3b\)](#page-5-0), which closely approximates the Tafel slope of 20% Pt/C (27.2 mV dec<sup>−</sup>1) and is substantially inferior to the value of other control catalysts. The measured Tafel slope for Ni-V2O3/PNF indicates the expedited HER kinetics via the Volmer–Tafel mechanism. Remarkably, when the annealing temperature deviates either lower (300°C) or higher (500°C), the HER activity of the resultant catalysts exhibits a significant deterioration. In addition, a comprehensive comparative analysis of the electrocatalytic performance between Ni-V2O3/PNF and previously reported non-noble metal electrocatalysts, conducted under identical conditions, is presented in Table S1 (Supporting Information). This comparison reveals the remarkable HER electrocatalytic capabilities exhibited by the developed Ni-V2O3/PNF catalyst

The electrocatalytic performance of the synthesized catalysts is meticulously evaluated employing electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). As illustrated in Figure S8 (Supporting Information), the charge transfer resistance (*R*ct) for HER is notably lower for Ni-V2O3/PNF in comparison to the other prepared catalysts. This observation demonstrates the pivotal role played by the formation of the IEF in augmenting charge transfer capabilities. To further assess the electrocatalytic activities of these catalysts, we gauged the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA), a parameter proportional to the electrochemical double-layer capacitance (*C*dl). Cyclic voltammograms (CVs) conducted at varying scan rates within the non-Faradaic region (Figure S9a-f) facilitated the quantification of the active surface area of the catalysts. Remarkably, Ni-V2O3/PNF has a *C*dl value of 155.51 mF cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> for HER (Figure S9g, Supporting Information), a value significantly surpassing those of Ni/PNF and V2O3/PNF. This finding alludes to the abundance of readily accessible active sites, thereby reinforcing the enhancement of the HER performance. Notably, even after normalizing by the specific active surface area (Figure S10, Supporting Information), Ni-V2O3/PNF still exhibits superior catalytic activity, further suggesting the synergistic effects stemming from electron redistribution at the heterointerface and an augmented exposure of catalytic active sites for HER. The low *R*ct and high *C*dl values further demonstrate that the formation of interfacial IEF enhances the electronic conductivity and increases the active sites, which is consistent with the remarkable HER activities observed in LSV results. In terms of stability assessment, Ni-V2O3/PNF underwent a rigorous examination via continuous CV scanning. The polarization curve obtained after 3000 cycles closely overlaps with the initial curve, attesting

to the catalyst's remarkable stability (Figure 3c, inset). In contrast, the 20% Pt/C catalyst exhibits a significant decline in activity. Furthermore, multiple chronopotentiometric curves for Ni-V2O3/PNF at current densities of −10, −50, and −100 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> demonstrate no significant attenuation within 48 h, whereas the 20% Pt/C catalyst exhibits a noticeable decline in activity after 20 h (Figure 3c). The long-term stability of Ni-V2O3/PNF is also evaluated at a higher current density of −200 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2, revealing a high potential retention relative to its initial potential over 48 h (Figure S11, Supporting Information). These results collectively confirm the superior long-term stability of Ni-V2O3/PNF towards HER.

The electrochemical performance of electrocatalysts is significantly influenced by their mass transport ability, a property that can be effectively evaluated through wettability measurements.[\[41\]](#page-11-0) To facilitate a quantitative comparison of the wettability among different catalysts, we conducted contact angle (CA) measurements. As shown in Figure 3d, Ni-V2O3/PNF exhibits the smallest water CAs, measuring 6.3°, in stark contrast to the high water contact angles of bare PNF (137.8°) and 20% Pt/C/PNF (109.1°). This result exhibits the excellent hydrophilicity of Ni-V2O3/PNF. Furthermore, the bubble CAs of Ni-V2O3/PNF (153.6°) exceed those of bare PNF (134.8°) and 20% Pt/C/PNF (141.7°), illustrating its notable aerophobicity. In combination, these findings suggest that Ni-V2O3/PNF possesses efficient mass transport characteristics and gas bubble release capabilities on its surface. Figure 3e provides visual evidence of this phenomenon, depicting gas bubbles on the surfaces of bare PNF and 20% Pt/C/PNF, which tend to strongly adhere and rapidly grow to substantial sizes ranging from 300 to 600 μm. In contrast, gas bubbles on the surface of Ni-V2O3/PNF remain smaller in size, measuring less than or equal to 300 μm, and they can readily escape into the solution. In accordance with the theory of solid-liquid-gas interfaces, a rough electrode surface tends to establish discontinuous contact at a three-phase interface, resulting in a relatively limited contact region between bubbles and electrode surfaces. This enhances the adsorption and desorption of reactants and gaseous products.[\[42\]](#page-11-0)

The remarkable activity of Ni-V2O3/PNF in the HER prompted further investigation of its potential as an efficient electrocatalyst for the HOR in alkaline electrolytes. To assess its HOR performance, the monolithic Ni-V2O3/PNF electrode is directly tested in an H2-saturated 0.1 m KOH electrolyte with continuous H2 bubbling. For comparison, we loaded 20% Pt/C on PNF and optimized its loading (2.5 mg cm<sup>−</sup>2, Figure S12, Supporting Information) to achieve the best HOR activity under identical conditions. The polarization curve is initially recorded between 0 and 0.2 V versus RHE in both H2- and Ar-saturated 0.1 m KOH. The substantial anodic current observed beyond 0 V upon H2 saturation (Figure S13, Supporting Information)

contrasts with the negligible capacitance current observed in the Ar-saturated condition, providing evidence that the anodic current arises from H2 oxidation. The HOR current of Ni-V2O3/PNF (**Figure 4**a is observed to initiate at 0 V, which closely approaches the performance of 20% Pt/C. At 0.09 V, the current density of Ni-V2O3/PNF is slightly lower than that of Pt/PNF (5.19 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> versus 5.63 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2). In contrast, bare Ni/PNF and V2O3/PNF exhibit much lower current densities of 0.86 and 0.21 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2, respectively. The exchange current density (*J*0) is determined in the micro-polarization region within a narrow potential range of −20 to 20 mV versus RHE. As shown in Figure 4b, both Ni-V2O3/PNF and 20% Pt/C exhibit HER and HOR activities commencing at nearly zero overpotential in 0.1 m KOH. Ni-V2O3/PNF has a *J*<sup>0</sup> of 1.63 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2, which is 7.4 and 14.8 times higher than that of Ni/PNF and V2O3/PNF, respectively, revealing its superior electrocatalytic activity in HOR.

Subsequently, we assessed the HOR activity of catalyst powder, obtained by ultrasonication to separate the catalysts from the porous nickel foam skeleton, in H2-saturated 0.1 m KOH to examine their kinetic parameters. The mass loading of catalysts on the glassy carbon rotating disk electrode (RDE) is maintained at 0.2 mgmetal cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> for standardized measurements.[\[14\]](#page-10-0) As a reference precious metal benchmark, commercial 20% Pt/C was used for comparison. Upon rotation at 1600 rpm (Figure 4c), the polarization curve of 20% Pt/C rapidly reaches 2.21 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> at a potential of 50 mV. In contrast, Ni-V2O3 demonstrates high HOR activity, achieving 1.68 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> at 50 mV. This observation signifies the significant potential of Ni-V2O3 as a viable alternative to Pt/C in commercial applications. However, it should be noted that the anodic HOR current of Ni-V2O3 starts to decline when anodically polarized beyond 0.25 V (Figure S14, Supporting Information), primarily due to the inevitable oxidation of Ni at higher potentials, which is a common occurrence in previously reported Ni-based electrocatalysts.[\[17,43](#page-10-0)] Additionally, the poor HOR activities of Ni-V2O3-300/500 further reveal the substantial effect of annealing temperature, which should be attributed to the variations in the components of the resulting catalysts.

The kinetic properties of the Ni-V2O3 catalyst for HOR are assessed through Koutecky–Levich analysis. Figure S15a (Supporting Information) displays the RDE polarization curves recorded at various electrode rotation speeds ranging from 2500 to 400 rpm. As expected, the anodic currents gradually decrease as a result of the lower mass transport at lower rotation speeds. By plotting *J*<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> and <sup>−</sup>1/2 at an overpotential () of 50 mV in the Koutecky–Levich plot (Figure S15b, Supporting Information), we obtain a linear correlation with a slope of 4.48 cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> mA<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> s<sup>−</sup>1/2 for Ni-V2O3. This slope is close to the theoretical value for HOR via the two-electron process, signifying the excellent kinetic

properties of Ni-V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. The kinetic current density  $(I_k)$  is calculated from the extrapolation of the linear plots in Figure \$15b (Supporting Information) and found to be 3.86 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> at  $\eta = 50$  mV. Normalized to catalyst mass, the mass kinetic current density  $(J_{mk})$  for Ni-V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> is determined to be 19.3 A g<sup>-1</sup>. Furthermore, the  $J_0$  is calculated to be 1.12 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> for Ni-V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> (Figure 4d), corresponding to a mass exchange current density  $(J_{m0})$  of 5.6 A g<sup>-1</sup>. Both  $J_k$  and  $J_0$  for Ni-V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> outperform previously reported Ni-based HOR electrocatalysts (Table S2, Supporting Information), indicating the enhanced kinetic performance of Ni-V2O3. However, it is important to note that the mass activities of  $J_{mk}$  and  $J_{m0}$  are dependent on the catalyst loading on the RDE (Figure S16, Supporting Information). For instance, when the mass loading of Ni-V2O3 decreases to  $0.05 \text{ mg cm}^{-2}$ ,  $J_{m0}$  increases to 7.67 A g<sup>-1</sup>, while the corresponding  $I_0$  is 0.39 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. On the other hand, when the mass loading increases to 0.40 mg cm<sup>-2</sup>, the highest  $J_0$  is obtained, but  $J_{m0}$ decreases to 3.88 A g<sup>-1</sup>. It is possible that by further reducing the catalyst loading, these two values could be enhanced to their maximum limit.[17,44] However, achieving this objective would require meticulous optimization of the catalyst ink formulation, which can be a time-consuming process.

The stability of HOR is evaluated through chronoamperometry tests, where a constant overpotential of 50 mV is applied under H<sub>2</sub>-saturated conditions. As seen in Figure 4e, Ni-V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/PNF demonstrates minimal current fluctuation over the testing period, indicative of its stable performance. In contrast, the 20% Pt/C catalyst exhibits a gradually decreasing current. Additionally, when tested in the presence of Ar gas, the anodic current density of Ni-V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/PNF remains close to zero, confirming that the hydrogen oxidation process occurs on the Ni-V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> heterostructures. After subjecting the Ni-V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/PNF catalyst to 3000 potential cycles of CV scans, it exhibits negligible decay, which affirms its robust stability for long-term HOR operation. Furthermore, the Ni-V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/PNF catalyst demonstrates remarkable HOR activity in a wide pH range, spanning from pH 7 to pH 14, as shown in the HOR polarization curves in Figure 4f. This illustrates the high pH tolerance of the developed Ni-based catalysts. In summary, these results collectively indicate that Ni-V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/PNF exhibits impressive activity and durability for alkaline HOR.

The durability and structural integrity of Ni-V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/PNF after undergoing HER and HOR tests are examined through various characterizations, including SEM, XRD, TEM, and XPS analyses. The SEM and XRD measurements (Figure S17, Supporting Information) show that the nanosheet morphology and crystalline phase are well-preserved in the post-HER sample. These results further confirm the durability and feasibility of Ni-V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/PNF for long-term operation. The value of  $C_{\rm dl}$  of Ni-V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/PNF after the stability test only exhibits a slight decrease, as shown in Figure \$18 (Supporting Information), which is consistent with its remarkable stability. The significant durability of Ni-V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/PNF can be attributed to the prevention of detachment of active species of interconnected nanosheets with sufficient heterojunctions. After HOR test, the XRD pattern and SEM images in Figure \$19 (Supporting Information) reveal that Ni-V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/PNF maintains the initial phase and morphology. The high-resolution TEM images in Figure S20 (Supporting Information) confirm that the Ni-V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> interface is well-maintained, while the crystalline nanoparticles are coated by an amorphous shell. From the observation of EDX

element distribution and the corresponding line scan in Figure S21 (Supporting Information), it can be seen that the Ni element far from the interface of Ni-V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> is significantly oxidized, while the Ni adjacent to the Ni-V2O3 interface is not significantly oxidized. This indicates that the Ni-V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> interface could improve the ability of Ni to resist electrochemical oxidation during the HOR process. Meanwhile, this also proves to a certain extent that the interface area of the Ni-V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> heterojunction is the real active site of HOR.[45] After the HOR test, Figure S22a (Supporting Information) shows the positive shifting of the binding energy of zerovalence Ni in comparison with Ni nanoparticles, indicating that electron redistribution remains at the Ni-V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> heterojunctions, which is beneficial for the increase of HOR activity. Figure \$22b (Supporting Information) reveals that after the HOR test, the proportion of V<sup>3+</sup> signal from the deconvolved V 3d spectrum shows a similar ratio. The same electron transferring is also maintained, which is responded to by the same position of the V<sup>3+</sup> peak compared to the initial one. In summary, these findings suggest that the Ni-V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> heterojunction not only enables efficient electron redistribution at the Ni sites, improving the adsorption of intermediates but also protects the adjacent metallic Ni sites from the harmful oxidation of hydroxyl groups under the strong alkaline conditions, thus ensuring exceptional stability. To investigate the possible metal ions dissolution of Ni-V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/PNF during stability tests, the EDX spectrum was conducted. As shown in Figures S23 and S24 (Supporting Information), the atomic ratio of V to Ni changes from 0.47 to 0.44 for HER and to 0.53 for HOR, respectively. These results indicate that the slight surface oxidation during stability tests results in the partial dissolution of Ni or V element into the electrolyte, while the morphology and phase of Ni-V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/PNF are maintained. As a result, the Ni-V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> heterostructures demonstrate robustness during HER and HOR tests, contributing to their outstanding stability and corrosion resistance, which are crucial factors for practical applications.

#### 2.3. Theoretical Investigation

DFT calculations were employed to investigate the electronic interaction of the Ni-V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> interfaces, shedding light on its pivotal role in the promotion of catalytic activities for both HER and HOR. As a model, we consider the Ni(110)/V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> surface, representative of the Ni-V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> heterostructure, while Ni(110) and V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>(012) surfaces are used for comparative purposes. To offer a quantitative insight into electron transfer phenomena, we calculate charge density differences, as illustrated in Figure 5a. Blue regions in this depiction signify electron accumulation, while yellow areas denote electron depletion. This computational analysis unveils the redistribution of charge resulting from the interplay between Ni and V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, and the migration of electrons from Ni to V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> at the interface. Importantly, this observation aligns with the outcomes of XPS and UPS results. The calculated work function of Ni, standing at 4.4 eV, is notably 0.7 eV lower than that of V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> (Figure S25, Supporting Information). This disparity in work function satisfies the requisite conditions for the establishment of an interfacial energy barrier and facilitates the theoretical possibility of charge transfer from Ni to V2O3 at the interfaces. Further exploration of the relationship between electronic structure alterations and  $\epsilon_{\mathrm{d}}$  holds substantial significance in

unraveling the underlying electrocatalytic mechanism. In this context, the density of states (DOS) for Ni,  $V_2O_3$ , and Ni- $V_2O_3$  are meticulously computed, as illustrated in Figure 5b. The analysis of the local DOS reveals striking disparities concerning the  $E_f$ . Particularly,  $V_2O_3$  exhibits limited electron transfer due to its unsatisfactory electron distribution near  $E_f$ . In contrast, Ni displays high electronic conductivity without any band gap. Importantly, the surface DOS of Ni- $V_2O_3$  in the vicinity of  $E_f$  is largely attributed to Ni 3d and V 3d orbitals, implying that the adsorption of reaction intermediates on the catalyst's surface is significantly influenced by the electronic interactions between Ni and V

atoms. Furthermore, these interfacial electronic interactions can modulate the position of  $\epsilon_{\rm d}$ , consequently tailoring the adsorption behavior of reaction intermediates. It is noteworthy that Ni and  $\rm V_2O_3$  exhibit  $\epsilon_{\rm d}$  values of -1.23 and -0.15 eV, respectively, which indicate either too weak or too strong adsorption of hydrogen and oxygen intermediates. In contrast, the intermediate  $\epsilon_{\rm d}$  value of -0.83 eV for Ni-V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> is likely to optimize the adsorption of reaction intermediates, thereby amplifying electrocatalytic activities.

While the precise mechanism governing the alkaline HER and HOR remains a subject of ongoing debate, recent studies have **[www.advancedsciencenews.com](http://www.advancedsciencenews.com) [www.small-journal.com](http://www.small-journal.com)**

increasingly emphasized the pivotal roles played by the hydrogen binding energy (HBE) and OH binding energy (OHBE) as vital activity descriptors for these catalytic processes in alkaline electrolytes. In line with the Sabatier principle, the quest for a nearzero HBE value is motivated by the aim to achieve a delicate balance between hydrogen adsorption and desorption steps, thereby maximizing the performance of HER and HOR.[\[46\]](#page-11-0) Simultaneously, in accordance with the bifunctional theory, a more negative OHBE is highly favorable for OH adsorption, a critical step facilitating the Volmer process involved in the formation of water.[\[47\]](#page-11-0) As revealed in Figure [5c,](#page-8-0) the results of our DFT calculations indicate that the Ni-V2O3 catalyst demonstrates an optimized HBE value when compared to pristine V2O3, in addition to a stronger OHBE when contrasted with unalloyed Ni. Consequently, the Ni-V2O3 catalyst has nearly ideal HBE and OHBE values, pivotal

heterostructure surface (Figure S26, Supporting Information), revealing the less desirable interaction between H\*/OH\* intermediates and the surface active sites of Ni-V2O3. Furthermore, by evaluating the electrostatic potential along the Z-axis (Figure S27, Supporting Information), we observe a substantial charge transfer from Ni to V2O3 at the interface. This charge transfer effect diminishes as atoms move away from the interface toward the surface. Consequently, we infer that interfacial polarization generates an array of suitable active sites that effectively facilitate the adsorption of reaction intermediates.[48]

To further assess the effect of interfacial IEF on catalytic performance, we employ the crystal orbital Hamilton population (COHP) method to analyze the H─Ni or O─V bonds.[\[49,50\]](#page-11-0) The average integrated COHP (ICOHP) is calculated as a measure of interatomic bond strength. As depicted in Figure [5g,](#page-8-0) the adsorption configurations of the Ni-V2O3 interface exhibit less negative ICOHP than individual Ni at the sites where H\* atoms are adsorbed. The less negative COHP on the Ni-V2O3 interface signifies the enhancement of catalytic ability as less energy is required to break the H─Ni bond. Moreover, the ICOHP value of V and adsorbed O atom in OH for Ni-V2O3 is lower than that of V2O3 and Ni-V2O3 with surface V sites (Figure [5h\)](#page-8-0), further indicating the stronger bonding between the active-interface V and adsorbed OH. Therefore, these results provide a synergistic explanation for the enhanced activity and favorable kinetics of Ni-V2O3, indicating the significant influence of interface IEF on catalytic hydrogen evolution/oxidation in alkaline electrolytes.

The mechanisms behind the enhanced HER and HOR for Ni-V2O3 can be illustrated in Figure [5i.](#page-8-0) The work function difference drives the transfer of electrons from Ni to V2O3 in the heterogeneous Ni-V2O3 system, which results in the formation of a strong interfacial IEF with an asymmetrical charge distribution. In the process of water electrolysis, the H2O molecules are initially adsorbed on the surface of the electron-rich V2O3 side and are then dissociated into H\* and OH species via the Volmer step. The H\* species then preferably adsorb on the Ni side with the deficient electrons. After that, the adsorbed H\* will combine with another H\* and two electrons to form an H2 molecule under a nearly thermoneutral potential to finish the HER process. Moreover, the negatively charged V2O3 side of the heterojunction also plays a crucial role in promoting the OH adsorption during the Volmer step, while the nearby Ni side serves as the hydrogen adsorption sites, leading to a synergistic effect between Ni and V2O3 that favors the HOR process. Conversely, the suboptimal performances of Ni/PNF and V2O3/PNF can be ascribed to their conventional charge distributions, leading to either excessive or insufficient H\* adsorption in the context of HER/HOR. This discrepancy in charge distribution consequently results in a higher energy barrier for water dissociation during the HER process.

#### for substantially enhancing the kinetics of HER and HOR. The salient observation here is that the introduction of the IEF markedly optimizes the adsorption capabilities of H\* and OH\* on Ni-V2O3, representing a notable enhancement over the adsorption behavior on pure Ni and V2O3. This optimized adsorption configuration shows that surface OH species preferentially bind to the highly oxophilic V sites, located in close proximity to Ni, while H has a pronounced preference for adsorption on Ni atoms situated near the interfaces. Furthermore, we have meticulously probed the reaction pathways underlying the alkaline HER and HOR, as shown in Figure [5d.](#page-8-0) Typically, the initial step involves the adsorption of H2O onto the catalyst's surface, subsequently leading to the formation of OH\* + H\* and culminating in the generation and desorption of H2. Notably, for pure Ni, the formation of H2 represents the potential-determining step (PDS). However, the meticulous engineering of the interfacial region has the effect of shifting the PDS for Ni-V2O3 to water adsorption, effectively reducing the endothermic energy requirements. This crucial shift in the energy landscape aligns seamlessly with our previous observations gleaned from Tafel plots. Collectively, these theoretical insights provide compelling evidence of the efficacy of the Ni-V2O3 interface construction, effectively optimizing the electronic structure of the electrocatalysts. This results in not only a diminishment of the hydrogen adsorption-free energy but also a notable reduction in the activation energy governing water formation and dissociation processes, collectively enhancing the kinetics of alkaline HER and HOR. To gain a deeper understanding of the interfacial electron effects, we employ the projected density of states (PDOS), a valuable tool for visualizing bonding interactions between different components. Focusing on the H 1s PDOS of H\* adsorbed on Ni-V2O3, as illustrated in Figure [5e,](#page-8-0) it is evident that the PDOS is notably smaller than that of Ni in the vicinity of the *E*f. This obser-

vation substantiates the assertion that interfacial IEF attenuates the interaction between H\* and Ni-V2O3, a consequence of the pronounced electron migration occurring at the interface sites. Similarly, when scrutinizing the O 2p PDOS of OH\* adsorbed on Ni-V2O3, as shown in Figure [5f,](#page-8-0) the data indicates a higher PDOS compared to V2O3 in the proximity of the *E*f. This higher PDOS signifies an upshifted <sup>d</sup> subsequent to interface engineering and a reinforced p-d interaction. This enhancement suggests that OH\* can be more readily generated on the Ni-V2O3 catalyst. Furthermore, to offer a comprehensive perspective on the impact of interfacial IEF, we take into account the edge of the Ni-V2O3

### **3. Conclusion**

In conclusion, we have successfully engineered a bifunctional electrocatalyst comprising heterogeneous Ni-V2O3, which demonstrates remarkable efficiency in catalyzing alkaline hydrogen electrolysis. Notably, the Ni-V2O3/PNF catalyst displays exceptional electrocatalytic performance and long-term stability for both HER and HOR in alkaline electrolytes, effectively rivaling the benchmark Pt/C catalyst. Both experimental results

<span id="page-10-0"></span>and DFT calculations reveal the pivotal role of the asymmetric charge distribution, brought about by the disparity in work function at the Ni-V2O3 interface, which gives rise to a robust interfacial IEF. This IEF effect enables the negative charge-enriched V2O3 side to facilitate water molecule dissociation, while the positively charged Ni side optimizes H\* adsorption. Additionally, the nanosheet structure of the Ni-V2O3/PNF provides an abundance of active sites and enhances mass transport, collectively conferring exceptional electrocatalytic performance for alkaline hydrogen electrolysis. Our findings emphasize the potential of controlling interfacial IEF to modulate surface charge distribution, offering a promising avenue for the development of advanced bifunctional electrocatalysts in diverse electrocatalytic applications.

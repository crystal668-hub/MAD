**Abstract:** This work concerns the studies of hydrogen oxidation and evolution reactions (HOR and HER) on PtxNi1-x/C materials synthesized by bromide anion exchange (BAE) method. The physicochemical characterizations show that this surfactant free method enables to prepare well dispersed and effective catalysts for the processes involved either in the anode of H2/O<sup>2</sup> fuel cells (HOR) or the cathode of water electrolyzer (HER). The Pt-based materials were modified by different Ni contents in order to "reduce" the costly precious metal amount in the electrode materials. These modified Pt-based materials were found to be electroactive for both reactions and without additional overpotential. The kinetic parameters such as Tafel slope (b), exchange ((j0) and kinetic (jk) current densities, and the rate determining steps (rds) of the reaction mechanisms were determined for each Pt-Ni catalyst and compared to those obtained at the Pt/C surface in alkaline medium. High j<sup>0</sup> values were obtained indicating the probable contribution of the surface structure of the catalyst due to their roughness and the presence of oxygenated Ni species even at low potentials.

# **Introduction**

According to the World Energy Council 2013 (WEC),[1] total global primary energy consumption rose by approximately 45% from 1990 to 2010, and it is expected that it will continue to rise, but at a much lower rate than in previous decades. There is no single global solution to the energy supply issue, each individual parts of the challenge must be worked out to reach the global goal of sustainable energy. To date, fossil fuels represent almost 80% of the energy sources required on the planet. [2] Their combustion leads to the formation of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), such as CO, CO2, NOx ….etc.., which are harmful to the health and the environment. Indeed, VOCs are sources of air pollution and have strong respiratory toxicity endangering the human health and contribute to the greenhouse effect. To prevent any impact of a huge increase of these gases in the atmosphere with the energy demand growth, new and emerging energy conversion and storage technologies are required. Among these alternative and sustainable energy sources, hydrogen is predicted to be a promising energy vector, with the advantage of having high energy density (140 MJ kg-1

) which far

exceeds that of gasoline and coal. The use of hydrogen as an energy source in fuel cells does not release carbon compounds into the atmosphere and the only by-product formed from its oxidation is water [3, 4]. As far as hydrogen energy conversion and storage technologies are concerned, both its oxidation (HOR) and its production (HER) must be investigated to understand their reaction mechanisms and to determine the kinetic parameters of these reactions (HOR, HER) on given electrode materials. These features are presently needed to promote the technologies mentioned above, which could play a key role in the near future up to 2050.[1] Although theoretical and experimental approaches have resulted in great progress in HER/HOR catalysis, a continuous effort is still necessary to provide a breakthrough in the development of catalysts that are cost-effective and highly durable for their utilization as cathode and anode in a solid polymer electrolyte (SPE) electrolyzer and in a fuel cell, respectively. Platinum referred as excellent electrocatalyst is the most widely used material for HER/HOR investigations. [5-11] Both reactions are characterized by extremely fast kinetics on platinum electrodes with an almost perfect reversibility. On platinum electrodes, very low overpotentials are required to generate large cathodic current densities in the acidic media that are used for water electrolysis in SPE systems. Although Pt remains the best catalyst for both reactions, many research efforts are made to remove or at least to reduce its content in the electrode material composition because it is expensive and relatively scarce in the earth's crust. This limits its interest in energy systems deployed at global scale.[12-19] Alloying or coupling of Pt with a second cheap metal that can provide among others an electronic effect to the catalyst, is one of the strategies to maintain or enhance the catalytic activity of an electrode material.[20] Consequently, a significant decrease of the electrode material cost should be noted. Earth-abundant elements such as Ni have been demonstrated to serve as cocatalyst in various electrochemical reactions. In the present work our investigations are focused on the role of Ni in the catalytic activity of Pt towards the HER and HOR. Indeed it is well known that this cheap and abundant transition metal (TM) is thermodynamically stable in alkaline medium, and can catalyze water reduction with high overpotentials. [21, 22] Carbon supported PtxNi1-x electrode materials were prepared from the Bromide Anion Exchange (BAE) method which is a surfactant-free simple chemical synthesis approach that prevents an inhibition of some catalytic sites by long-chain organic compounds.[23-25] The presence of Ni provides a markedly beneficial effect at the bimetallic electrode surface for the HER. The same Nicontaining Pt materials employed for HER were also used to study the HOR. Although the Ni co-catalyst is not directly

involved in the HOR, the increase of its content in the electrode material may influence the structure of the anode. Main Text Paragraph.

# **Results and Discussion**

#### **3.1 Physicochemical Characterization of the Catalysts**

To access the accurate experimental metal loading of each asprepared nanomaterial, TGA/DTA experiments were conducted. Figure 1a shows the thermogravimetric curves recorded under air flow for the Pt/C material. The weak weight loss (TGA curve) in the first interval between 25 and 250 ◦C is likely due to the elimination of adsorbed and intercalated water in the catalytic powder. The main loss weight starts at *ca*. 356 °C with a high exothermic peak (DTA curve) centered at *ca*. 431 °C, which corresponds to the complete combustion of the carbon support (XC-72R), as reported elsewhere [26]. It is followed by a weak peak on DTA which can be explained by the existence of two different carbon phases [26, 27]. Figure 1b shows the presence of the Ni(OH)<sup>2</sup> phase in the Ni/C material by the weight loss between 250 and 400 °C; it is assigned to the following reaction (Eq. 1) as mentioned in the literature [23, 28]:

$$Ni(OH)_2 \rightarrow NiO + H_2O$$
 (1)

DTA/TGA analyses performed on the bimetallic PtxNi1-x/C materials were shown on Figure 1 (c to f). Three exothermic peaks (DTA curves) and a shift of the main combustion temperature peaks of the carbon support can be observed. According to the thermograms nickel oxide (NiO) is only present on Pt0.2Ni0.8/C due probably to the high molar ratio of Ni in this material. The metal loadings obtained for the different PtxNi1-x/C materials are summarized in Table 1 and are found to be in the range of 19-23 wt.%, *i.e*. in good agreement with the targeted 20 wt.% metal loading.

Figure 1: DTA/TGA curves of a) Pt/C, b) Ni/C, c) Pt0.7Ni0.3/C, d) Pt0.5Ni0.5/C e) Pt0.3Ni0.7/C and f) Pt0.2Ni0.8/C materials recorded in air atmosphere at 5 °C min−1 and from 25 to 900 ◦C

The XRD patterns of the PtxNi1-x/C materials are plotted in Figure 2. The bimetallic nanomaterials are compared with pure monometallic counterparts of Pt and Ni. The pattern of the Pt/C nanomaterials is similar to that observed in the literature [27, 29] . However, the pattern of Ni/C does not show the peaks of metallic Ni but reveals those of Ni(OH)<sup>2</sup> at 33 and 38°, corresponding respectively to the reflection planes (100) and (101) of the hexagonal compact structure of β-Ni(OH)<sup>2</sup> [30] . The

presence of Ni in the PtxNi1-x/C materials leads to a shift in 2θ values compared with pure Pt/C. Both Pt/C and PtxNi1-x/C crystallize in a fcc structure. As can be seen in the bimetallic PtxNi1-x/C materials, the peaks corresponding to Ni(OH)<sup>2</sup> species appear when the Ni amount increases (Pt0.2Ni0.8/C). This result is in agreement with the TGA measurements (Figure 1b). Based on Bragg's law for a fcc structure, the lattice parameters (*a*) and the inter-reticular distance (*d*) were determined for Pt/C and PtxNi1-x/C [27] . Scherrer's relation [23] was also used to determine the mean crystallite size (*Lv*) based on the well-defined reflection plane (111) (Table 1).

The TEM images of the PtxNi1-x/C nanomaterials synthesized by the surfactant-free BAE method are displayed in Figure 3. An excellent dispersion of the nanoparticles observable as dark spots on a carbon support was obtained for Pt/C, Pt0.7Ni0.3/C and Pt0.5Ni0.5/C samples. As can be seen in Figs. 3a, 3c and 3f, the images exhibit spherical-like shape nanoparticles. Narrow size distribution was obtained with a mean particles size around 3-5 nm. The Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and the Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP-OES) analyses reveal that the whole catalysts contain the atomic compositions close to the nominal expected ones.

When increasing the Ni content above 50% (Figs. 3g and 3h), clusters, isolated nanoparticles with spherical and agglomerate morphologies were observed on the TEM images. The latter particles were scrutinized with high-resolution-TEM in order to correlate their structure to the observed specific electrochemical activity (in 3.2.3 section). As can be observed in the HRTEM image inserted in Figure 3g, the particles have a PtNi core-shell structure with a Ni-enriched core. Indeed EDS analysis shows that region A is composed of 9.76 at.% Pt and 90.24 at.% Ni. In region B the shell contains 15.08 at.% of Pt which increases when the sample is probed outward. Conversely to the previous figure, Figure 3 h, which represents the TEM images of Pt0.2Ni0.8/C material displays isolated and agglomerated PtNi nanoparticles. The EDS analysis shows that the region C is composed of 39.44 and 60.56 at.% of Pt and Ni, respectively. Although the ICP-OES analysis reveals that the elementary composition of the whole material is close to the nominal one, the EDS measurement provides evidence that homogeneous bimetallic material samples can hardly be obtained for high Ni contents.

### **3.2. Electrochemical Characterizations of the Catalysts 3.2.1. Cyclic voltammetry**

To afford evidences of changes in the electrochemical behavior of the PtNi electrode materials, CVs of Pt/C and Ni/C were first recorded in 0.1 mol L-1 NaOH at 50 mV s-1 and 21 °C (Figure 4). CVs allow also to verify the cleanness of the operating system (cell, electrolyte, electrode surface,…). The CV of Pt/C (Fig. 4a) is composed of three regions:

Region I is that of reversible hydrogen adsorption-desorption. Region II represents the Pt double layer. Conversely to the double layer of a massive Pt electrode, the present one is larger because of the contribution of the carbon which represents 80 wt.% of the catalyst loading.

Region III: During the forward potential scan the CV exhibits (E > 0.6 V *vs*. RHE) the region of the Pt surface oxidation. During the backward potential scan the peak observed at *ca* 0.75 V *vs*. RHE represents the irreversible reduction of the Pt oxides.

The CV of Ni/C nanomaterial in the supporting electrolyte is shown in Figure 4b. No hydrogen adsorption/desorption region was observed. During the positive potential scan, a double layer current is observed from 0.05 to 1.4 V *vs*. RHE. It is followed by the oxidation of the surface of Ni nanoparticles, which leads to the formation of oxyhydroxide species according to Eq. 2 [31, 32] .

$$\beta\text{-Ni}(OH)_2 + OH \rightarrow NiOOH + H_2O + e^{-}$$
 (2)

Figure 4. Voltammograms of Pt/C (a) and Ni/C (b) electrodes in 0.1 mol L-1 NaOH recorded at 50 mV s-1 and 21 °C.

The negative potential scan from 1.5 to 1.1 V *vs*. RHE shows, the reduction of the oxyhydroxide species with a maximum current density peak centered at *ca*. 1.25 V. The reduction process starting at 0.6 V *vs*. RHE in a wide potential range, is attributed to the reduction of Ni(OH)<sup>2</sup> [32] .

Figure 5 shows the CVs of PtxNi1-x/C nanomaterials in 0.1 mol L-1 NaOH electrolyte. The upper potential limit was set at that applied for the Pt/C electrocatalyst to avoid any Pt dissolution. As the exhibition of these CVs concerns only the electrochemical behavior of each as-prepared material sample, the currents were simply normalized with the geometric surface area of the GC disk (0.071 cm<sup>2</sup> ) support. One can observe that the electrochemical response of the electrode materials depends on the Ni content. Indeed, the hydrogen adsorption-desorption region decreases as expected with the increase of the Ni content in the bimetallic composition.

Surprisingly, the "Pt oxide" region is more or less hidden with the decrease of the Pt content. This is probably due to the formation of Ni(OH)<sup>2</sup> species which cannot thoroughly be reduced at this applied upper potential limit.

#### **3.2.2. Hydrogen oxidation reaction on the catalysts**

The hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) was studied on the PtxNi1-x/C nanomaterials in a H2-saturated 0.1 mol L-1 NaOH solution. Electrochemical measurements were carried out with rotating disk electrode (RDE) at several rotation speeds Ω (from 0 to 2500 revolution per minute (rpm)). Figure 6 shows the polarization curves of the Pt/C catalyst at 1 mV s-1 and at controlled temperature of 21 °C. It can be observed that the current density increases with the rotation speed. The H<sup>2</sup> oxidation begins at 0 V *vs*. RHE and reaches rapidly a limiting current value which depends on the rotation speed [33] .

Figure 6. Polarization curves of Pt/C nanomaterial in a H2 saturated 0.1 mol L-1 NaOH solution recorded at 1 mV s-1 ; 21 °C and at different rotation speeds.

The polarization curves obtained with the bimetallic PtxNi1-x nanomaterials are separately shown in Figure 7. As the kinetic parameters of the HOR at the Pt electrode are well known, the findings on the PtNi electrode surface can be easily compared in terms of activity with those of Pt. According to Figure 4b, Ni<sup>0</sup> is a dehydrogenating catalyst towards water *i.e*. not capable of catalyzing the H<sup>2</sup> oxidation. To support this statement, one observes that the activity of the PtxNi1-x/C nanomaterials ARTICLE WILEY-VCH

decreases with the Pt content apart from the  $Pt_{0.3}Ni_{0.7}/C$  catalyst (this specific case will be discussed later) and the presence of Ni does not increase the overpotential value. Indeed, it can be noticed that at 0.1 V vs. RHE and 2500 rpm the catalyst ranking according to their activity catalyst towards the HOR is as follows:  $Pt = Pt_{0.3}Ni_{0.7}/C > Pt_{0.7}Ni_{0.3}/C > Pt_{0.5}Ni_{0.5}/C > Pt_{0.2}Ni_{0.7}/C$  towards the pointed out above, the excellent ability of  $Pt_{0.3}Ni_{0.7}/C$  towards the

HOR can be likely explained by the core-shell structure which provides a shell-interface enriched by Pt. Whatever the electrode composition, at higher overpotentials, one observes markedly diffusion plateaus indicating that the HOR is controlled by the mass transport of molecular  $H_2$ .

Figure 7. Polarization curves of  $Pt_xNi_{1.x}/C$  nanomaterials in a  $H_2$ -saturated 0.1 mol  $L^{-1}$  NaOH solution recorded at 1 mV s<sup>-1</sup>; 21 °C and at different rotation speeds; (a)  $\Omega$  = 0 rpm; (b)  $\Omega$  = 900 rpm; (c)  $\Omega$  = 2500 rpm.

From the different polarization curves obtained, the kinetic parameters were assessed by using Koutecký-Levich approach. According to the literature, the HOR follows a combination of several steps [34]:

The diffusion in the bulk from the solution to the electrode is characterized by the diffusion coefficient D:

$$H_{2sol} \rightarrow H_{2elec}$$
 (3)

At the electrode surface,  $H_2$  diffuses in the catalytic film of the ink. This step is associated with the limiting current density in the film  $i_1^{film}$ :

$$H_{2\text{elec}} \rightarrow H_{2\text{surface}}$$
 (4)

Afterwards, the adsorption of  $H_2$  on the active site takes place with a limiting adsorption current density  $j_i^{ads}$  according to the equation:

$$H_{2surface} + 2M \rightarrow 2MH_{ads}$$
 (Tafel) (5)

where M is the free active site.

Considering the Volmer pathway which involves one electron and leads to the formation of water (Eq. 6), the exchange current density  $j_0$ , and Tafel slope b are the main parameters:

$$MH_{ads} + OH^{-} \rightarrow M + H_2O + e^{-}$$
 (Volmer) (6)

Another possibility is the Heyrovsky pathway in which molecular  $H_2$  reacts with hydroxide species at an active site leading to the formation of adsorbed hydrogen (MH<sub>ads</sub>), water and one electron.

$$H_2 + OH^- + M \leftrightarrow MH_{ads} + H_2O + e^-$$
 (Heyrovsky) (7)

This suggests to consider the related parameters such as the exchange current density j<sub>0</sub>' and the Tafel slope b'.

The overall current density can be expressed in terms of the kinetic ( $j_k$ ) and diffusional ( $j_k^{diff}$ ) current densities, as follows:

$$\frac{1}{j} = \frac{1}{j_{l}^{diff}} + \frac{1}{j_{l}^{film}} + \frac{1}{j_{l}^{ads}} - \frac{1}{j_{0}(\theta/\theta_{e}) \exp(\eta/b)}$$
(8)

where  $\eta$  = E-E<sub>eq.</sub>  $\theta$  and  $\theta$ <sub>e</sub> are the degrees of coverage in adsorbed hydrogen at  $\eta \neq 0$  and at equilibrium ( $\eta = 0$ ), respectively.

For low  $\eta$  values,  $\theta \approx \theta_{\rm e}$ , the diffusion limiting current density of molecular hydrogen in the bulk electrolyte ( $j_i^{\rm diff}$ ) is controlled by the rotation speed  $\Omega$ , whereas the diffusion limiting current density inside the film, ( $j_i^{\rm film}$ ), is independent of  $\Omega$ .

The diffusion limiting current density in the electrolyte is given by the Levich law:

$$j_L^{diff} = 0.201 \ n_t \ F \ D^{2/3} v^{-1/6} C_0 \ \Omega^{1/2} = n_t B \Omega^{1/2}$$
 (9)

with  $n_t$  the total number of exchanged electrons. B can be calculated at 21 °C assuming  $D=3.4~10^{-5}~{\rm cm^2~s^{-1}}$  for the diffusion coefficient hydrogen,  $u=1.023~10^{-2}~{\rm cm^2~s^{-1}}$  for the kinematic viscosity of 0.1 mol L<sup>-1</sup>, and  $C_o=0.7~10^{-3}~{\rm mol~L^{-1}}$  for the bulk concentration of hydrogen in a saturated 0.1 mol L<sup>-1</sup> NaOH electrolytic solution  $^{[33,~35]}$ . This gives B = 0.0598, when  $\Omega$  is expressed in rpm.

Equation (8) becomes:

ChemPhysChem 10.1002/cphc.201600733

ARTICLE WILEY-VCH

$$\frac{1}{j} = \frac{1}{n_t B \Omega^{1/2}} + \frac{1}{j_l} + \frac{1}{j_0} \frac{1}{\exp(\eta/b)}$$
 (10)

where 
$$\frac{1}{j_l} = \frac{1}{j_l^{ads}} + \frac{1}{j_l^{film}}$$
 (11)

 $j_i$  is the limiting current density resulting from a mixed control by the diffusion of molecular hydrogen inside the film, and by the hydrogen adsorption on the Pt particles. Since these current densities are both independent of the rotation rate  $\Omega$  and the electrode potential E, the separation of the two processes is not possible; therefore the data analysis will only give  $j_i$ .

Eq. (10) shows that the plot of the inverse of the current density (1/j) is a linear function of  $1/\Omega^{1/2}$  (Koutecký-Levich plots) (Figure 8). The intercept at the origin  $(\Omega \rightarrow \infty)$  gives the inverse of the kinetic current densities  $j_k$ , corrected from the diffusion part, as a function of the overvoltage.

$$\frac{1}{j_k} = \frac{1}{j_l} + \frac{1}{j_0} \frac{1}{\exp(\eta/b)}$$
 (12)

Eq. 10 becomes:

$$\frac{1}{j} = \frac{1}{n_t B \Omega^{1/2}} + \frac{1}{j_k} \tag{13}$$

Figure 8. Koutecky-Levich plots 1/j vs. 1/  $\Omega^{1/2}$  obtained for HOR on Pt/C catalyst in a H<sub>2</sub>-saturated 0.1 mol L<sup>-1</sup> NaOH solution recorded at 1 mV s<sup>-1</sup> and 21 °C.

From this equation, it appears that,  $1/j_k \rightarrow 1/j_l$  when  $1/j_0$  decreases to zero, which corresponds to high values of  $\eta$ . Therefore, the value of  $j_l$  can be estimated.

From the Eq. (12), it appears that for high overvoltage  $(\eta \rightarrow \infty)$ ,  $1/j_k$  tends towards  $1/j_k$ . Thereby the limiting current density  $j_l$  can be obtained by extrapolating Eq. (12) at high values of  $\eta$ , as shown in Fig. 9. This allows to transform the Eq. (12) as follows:

$$\eta = E - E_{eq} = b \left[ \ln \left( \frac{j_l}{j_0} \right) + \ln \left( \frac{j_k}{j_l - j_k} \right) \right]$$
(14)

Furthermore, plot of  $\ln[j_{b}/(j_{F}j_{k})]$  vs potential E (Fig. 10) gives a straight line with 1/b as slope. From these results, Tafel slope was easily calculated and the intercept at the origin leads to the exchange current density  $j_{0}$  from  $[-\ln(j_{b}/j_{0})]$ . The kinetic parameters b,  $j_{0}$ , are given in Table 2. We displayed b in mV  $\det^{-1}$ .

Ticianelli and co-workers <sup>[36]</sup> have studied HOR and assessed its kinetic parameters. The theoretical as well as experimental Tafel slopes were determined with the data from polarization curves using three rotation rates (400, 900 and 2500 rpm). Assumed both the reversible and irreversible reactions the plots were found to be linear and independent of rotation rates for irreversible reaction. They confirm those reported in the same operation conditions and are in good line with those assumed in Heyrovsky-Volmer mechanism <sup>[36, 37]</sup>, where Volmer step is the rate determining step.

In the literature, the values of the exchange current density  $(j_0)$  for HOR on Pt bulk electrode are lower in alkaline medium than those commonly reported in acidic solution <sup>[38]</sup>. Nevertheless, they show that the HOR kinetics is slower in this medium than in an acidic electrolyte. In our case, the exchange current density obtained on Pt/C is very larger than those reported by Bagotzky et al. <sup>[38]</sup> for bulk platinum. According to Durst et al. <sup>[39]</sup>, these unexpected high values of  $j_0$  are probably due to the roughness

ARTICLE WILEY-VCH

of the catalysts deposited onto the carbon substrate. Apart from the particular case in surface structure of the  $Pt_{0.3}Ni_{0.7}/C$  stressed out above, it can be noticed that the exchange current density value decreases with the Pt content [14].

#### 3.2.3. Hydrogen evolution reaction on the catalysts

Although the HER is the most fundamental reaction studied on poly and single crystal electrodes [5, 38, 40, 41], it becomes of great importance for also investigating it at the surface of novel electrode materials designed for SPE water electrolyzers. Aware that the surface structure plays certainly an essential role in this reaction rate, we propose herein to evaluate the kinetic parameters of the HER at the surface of surfactant free Pt<sub>v</sub>Ni<sub>1</sub>. <sub>x</sub>/C electrodes as potential nanocatalysts in SPE water electrolyzer in alkaline medium. Figure 11 displays the polarization curves of Pt/C and PtxNi<sub>1-x</sub>/C catalysts in a 0.1 mol L<sup>-</sup> <sup>1</sup> NaOH solution during the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) recorded at 2 mV s<sup>-1</sup> and controlled temperature of 21 °C. The currents were normalized with the mass of Pt in the catalyst composition. As can be seen in Figure 11, the H<sub>2</sub> evolution reaction at the Pt/C surface takes place with an overpotential close to zero

Figure 11. HER on  $Pt_xNi_{1.x}/C$  catalysts recorded in a  $N_2$ -saturated 0.1 mol  $L^{-1}$  NaOH solution at 2 mV s<sup>-1</sup> and 21 °C.

Surprisingly the increase of the Ni content in  $Pt_xNi_{1.x}$ , leads to an increase in the current densities and shifts the onset potential

compared with the Pt/C catalyst. At the end of the polarization curves present some disturbances due to the hydrogen bubbles formed at the catalysts surface [42, 43]. The catalyst with low Pt content (Pt<sub>0.2</sub>Ni<sub>0.8</sub>/C) shows the highest mass activity. Indeed, by decreasing the Pt loading, the evolution of H2 occurs with low overpotential. In the potential region where this reaction occurs, hydroxide species should be adsorbed on the surface. However, the electrode is sufficiently active to split the water molecule as proposed in the literature. Indeed, three reaction steps are suggested for the HER in alkaline media [44, 45]. The first one involves the formation of an adsorbed hydrogen species intermediate, MH<sub>ads</sub> (Volmer reaction, Eq. (15)). The second reaction step is the hydrogen desorption into solution (Heyrovsky reaction, Eq. (16)) and then the third one involves a chemical desorption by the combination of two adsorbed hydrogen species (Tafel reaction, Eq. (17)).

 $MH_{ads} + MH_{ads} \rightarrow H_2 + 2M$  (Tafel) (17)

where M is a free active site on the metal surface and  $\text{MH}_{\text{ads}}$  is the metal surface occupied by hydrogen species.

The Tafel slope value plays a key role in estimating the mechanism and the rate-determining step (*rds*) <sup>[5, 44, 45]</sup>. Thereby, Tafel slope values were assessed (Table 3) from the polarization curves by using the Eq. (18) and as shown in Figure 12.

$$\eta = a + b' \log(j) \tag{18}$$

where  $\eta$  is overpotential, j is the current density and b' the Tafel slope.

The higher the Tafel slope value was obtained for the catalyst containing 20 % of Pt. According to the literature, the Tafel slope for the HER is *ca.* 120 mV dec<sup>-1</sup> when the *rds* is Eq. (16), or Eq. (16) coupled with Eq. (17), or Eq. (16) coupled with Eq. (18). A value of 40 and 30 mV dec<sup>-1</sup> is theoretically expected when Eq. (17) and Eq. (18) are respectively the *rds* [46]. However, depending on the fitting method, *i.e.* the method of plotting the

tangent through the data points, a Tafel slope between 40 and 180 mV dec−1 can be obtained [5, 40, 41, 46] . Similar findings are reported for Pt/C until 50 at.% of Ni but for Pt0.3Ni0.7/C the Tafel slope decreases in comparison with Pt0.5Ni0.5/C, this might be due to the core-shell structure of the nanoparticles with a shell enriched in Pt which decreases the formation of oxygenated species at the surface of the catalyst.

The exchange current density was determined (Table 3) for each catalyst. In this work, the exchange current densities obtained for HER are lower than those presented by M.A. Domınguez-Crespo in acidic media on Pt and PtNi-alloy catalysts with a surface enriched in nickel atom [47]. This could be explained by the reaction speed of HER in alkaline medium which is slower than in acidic medium. It is observed that the activity of the catalysts decreases with the Pt-content excepted for Pt0.3Ni0.7/C where the activity increases and becomes close to that with low nickel content (Pt0.7Ni0.3/C). This phenomenon is attributed to the Pt-enriched surface of this catalyst. (Pt0.7Ni0.3/C). However, Pt0.3Ni0.7/C presents the best mass activity for hydrogen evolution reaction (Figure 11).

## **Conclusions**

As respective anodic and cathodic reaction in the SPE fuel cell and SPE water electrolysis, the HOR and HER were investigated in alkaline media to determine the different kinetic parameters. Effective electrode materials were thereby prepared from a soft chemical and surfactant-free method. The electrode components constitute the main cost in the evaluation of the aforementioned processes. Therefore, the diminution of the precious metal is economically needed. To this aim, a transition metal (nickel) was added to platinum for designing welldispersed PtxNi1-x/C bimetallic catalysts that have spherical-like shape particles. The physicochemical characterizations also showed that at high Ni content core-shell structures with a core enriched by Ni can be formed. The electrocatalysts were found to be very active towards the HER and HOR. In the H2 evolution reaction the addition of nickel to the Pt-based material enables to improve the dehydrogenation kinetics of the water molecule without additional overpotential. The electrochemical measurement permitted to evaluate the kinetic parameters of the HER that depend on the oxygenated species formed at the nickel surface and certainly the roughness of the electrode surface. Although nickel does not participate directly to the H2 oxidation process, its presence allows conserving equivalent activity compared with Pt/C. For example, excellent ability towards the HOR is obtained with Pt0.3Ni0.7/C, which is likely due to the core-shell structure providing a shell-interface enriched by Pt. Main Text Paragraph.

### **Experimental Section**

#### **Materials**

The electrochemical experiments were performed with aqueous electrolyte and solutions which were prepared with ultrapure water from Milli-Q ® Millipore system. The resistivity of this water is 18.2 MΩ cm at 20 °C. The electrocatalysts were prepared from metallic salts. Therefore, hexachloroplatinic (IV) acid hexahydrate (H2PtCl6.6H2O, ACS reagent, ≥ 37.50 % Pt basis), anhydrous Nickel (II) chloride (NiCl2, Alfa Aesar, 99%) were used as metal precursor salts. Potassium bromide (KBr, ≥ 99 %) and the reducing agent (NaBH4, 99 %) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich® and used as-received without further purification.

#### **Synthesis of PtxNi(1-x)/C nanoparticles by "Bromide Anion Exchange" method**

The "bromide anion exchange" (BAE) method is a synthesis approach developed in our research group for elaborating well dispersed mono, bi and trimetallic nanomaterials. Indeed, various carbon supported nanomaterials such as AuxPt1-x/C, PdxAg1-x/C and PdxNi1-x/C with different metal compositions have been recently prepared [23, 25, 48] . The BAE method has the main advantage in its implementation to be free of surfactant such as Brij® [25, 49], tannic acid [50] , tetradecyltrimethylammonium bromide [51], and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide [52], that can be strongly adsorbed at the catalyst surface, requiring a suitable cleaning step in order to make accessible the catalytic active sites. This one-pot method was used to synthesize herein a large range of PtxNi(1-x)/C nanoparticles. Briefly, the precursor salts of H2PtCl<sup>6</sup> and NiCl<sup>2</sup> were first dissolved in ultrapure water with different nominal molar ratios of Pt/Ni. This solution was maintained at 25 °C in a thermostatted bath. Afterwards, a certain amount of KBr was added to the solution (in the present case, the molar ratio n(KBr)/n(metal salts) = 1.46). Bromide ion replaces the chloride one, providing a significant steric environment. After this step, a desired amount of carbon (Vulcan XC-72R, Cabot), previously heat-treated at 400 °C under N<sup>2</sup> atmosphere for 4 h, was added to the solution for obtaining a metal loading of 20 wt.% in the synthesized nanomaterials. The mixture was then maintained under ultrasonication for 45 min for a homogeneous dispersion. Then, a solution of 0.1 mol L−1 NaBH<sup>4</sup> (nNABH4 / nmetal Salt = 15) was added, while stirring the mixture at 40 °C for 2 h. Finally, the resulted mixture was filtered on a 0.22 μm GSWP membrane (Fisher-Bioblock) and washed several times with ultrapure water to remove all ionic species. The remaining solid was dried in an oven at 40 °C for 12 h.

#### **Physicochemical Characterizations**

The differential thermal and thermogravimetric analyses (DTA/TGA) were performed by using the TA Instruments SDT Q600 apparatus equipped with TA Universal Analysis software. It permitted to confirm the theoretical metal loading in the synthesized nanomaterials. Therefore, two alumina crucibles were required: one containing *ca.* 10 mg of catalytic powder and another empty (reference) was heat-treated under air atmosphere (flow, 100 mL min−1 ) from 25 to 900 °C with a temperature rate of 5 °C min−1 .

The synthesized nanomaterials were also characterized by Xray diffraction (XRD) using an EMPYREAN PANanalytical diffractometer in Bragg–Brentano (θ–θ) configuration with a copper tube powdered at 45 kV and 40 mA (Cukα1 = 1.54060 Å and Cukα2 = 1.54443 Å) as source of radiation. A nickel filter was installed in a secondary optic in order to eliminate the k<sup>β</sup> component. The diffraction angle (in 2θ) from 15 to 100° was investigated in step mode, with steps of 0.05° and fixed acquisition time of 2 min/step. The measured data were analyzed with the HighScore Plus software.

The materials were then characterized by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM/HRTEM) model JEOL 2100 UHR (200 kV) equipped with a LaB6 filament. The mean particle size and size distribution were determined by measuring the diameter of isolated particles using ImageJ® free software.

#### **2.4. Electrochemical Characterizations of the Catalysts**

The electrochemical measurements were carried out in a conventional three-electrode Pyrex cell. The experiments were performed with an analogical potentiostat EG&G PARC Model 362 (Princeton Applied Research). A glassy carbon (GC) slab (6.48 cm<sup>2</sup> geometric surface area) and a GC disk (0.071 cm<sup>2</sup> geometric surface area) were served as counter and working electrodes, respectively. A mercury-mercury oxide electrode (Hg/HgO) in alkaline medium (0.1 mol L-1 NaOH) was used as reference electrode which was connected to the cell through a capillary tip with the same electrolyte as in the main cell. However, for convenience, all the results in this manuscript were referred versus Reversible Hydrogen Electrode (RHE). All experiments were carried out at controlled temperature of 21 ± 1 °C, in a 0.1 mol L-1 NaOH. Electrolytes were prepared with 18.2 MΩ cm Millipore-Milli Q water. To prepare the catalytic ink, 4 mg of catalytic powder was ultrasonically dispersed for 30 min in a homogeneous mixture composed of 50 μL Nafion® suspension (5 wt.% from Sigma-Aldrich) and 375 μL of ultrapure water. This amount of Nafion® does not affect the catalysts performance in alkaline medium. After homogenization, the optimized catalytic ink amount was dropwise deposited onto the GC disk. For each electrochemical measurement, 79.3 μg cm−2 of metal loading, were deposited onto the GC substrate. Before each experiment, the electrolyte was deoxygenated by bubbling pure nitrogen during 30 min. For all electrochemical experiments, the potential was measured in V *vs*. Hg/HgO. However, to simplify the comparison with the literature, it is expressed in V *vs*. RHE according to the equation: E(RHE) = (E(Hg/HgO) + 0.926) V by taking into account the concentration of the supporting electrolyte.

Membrane-bound [NiFe]-hydrogenase (MBH) from Hydrogenovibrio marinus is an  $O_2$ -tolerant enzyme and allows direct-electron-transfer (DET) bioelectrocatalysis for  $H_2$ -oxidation. MBH is a promising bioelectrocatalyst for bioanode of enzymatic  $H_2$ - $O_2$  biofuel cells. From the practical viewpoint of electricity production, the  $H_2$ -depletion near the electrode surface and the oxidative and reversible inactivation called "anaerobic inactivation" of [NiFe]-hydrogenases limit the  $H_2$ -oxidation at high potentials. We have already proposed a gas-diffusion system to avoid inactivation in our previous study. In this research, we have analyzed the kinetics of the electrochemically induced anaerobic inactivation and the DET bioelectrocatalytic reaction of MBH on electrodes. When the inactivation is considered as a competitive inhibition-like reaction, the maximum value of the apparent Michaelis constant reaches 6.5 mM (at Ketjen Black-modified electrode) as analyzed in our kinetic model. Since the value is larger than the saturated  $H_2$ -concentration in solution (0.74 mM), we conclude that high-speed  $H_2$ -supply realized by a gas-diffusion electrode is essential to compete with the inactivation. Furthermore, a gas-diffusion bioanode with MBH can eliminate the  $H_2$ -depletion near the electrode surface and has reached about  $10 \, \text{mA cm}^{-2}$  at  $0 \, \text{V}$  (vs. Ag[AgCl|sat. KCl electrode) under quiescent (passive) and  $H_2$ -atmospheric conditions.

Hydrogenases are enzymes which catalyze the interconversion between hydrogen and proton. The two major classes of hydrogenases are known as [FeFe] or [NiFe] according to the metals in their buried active sites. Since hydrogenases are highly active, with turnover frequencies for H<sub>2</sub>-oxidation in excess of thousands of molecules of H<sub>2</sub> per second at 30 °C, they can be alternative catalysts instead of platinum as an H<sub>2</sub>–O<sub>2</sub> fuel cell. From the aspect of bioelectrochemistry, hydrogenases have received a lot of attention, and the bioelectrocatalytic properties have extensively been characterized all over the world.  $^{1,2,5-8}$ 

Enzymatic biofuel cells, which are electric generators that utilize redox enzymes as catalysts, can generally operate under mild conditions (neutral pH, atmospheric pressure, and room temperature). They are classified into two types: mediated elec-

tron transfer (MET)-type and direct electron transfer (DET)-type. P-12 MET-type cell utilizes artificial mediators to shuttle the electron between the enzyme and the electrode to reduce the kinetic hindrance in the interfacial electron transfer. On the other hand, DET-type cell does not require, in principle, any separator or membrane between the electrodes due to the mediator-less configuration. In addition, the DET-type one can reduce the possible health hazard problems caused by artificial mediators and the thermodynamic loss ascribed to the difference in the redox potentials between the mediator and the active site of the enzyme. Furthermore, the DET-type system enables us to construct a very simple and compact enzymatic biofuel cell.

Unfortunately, the number of the enzymes capable of DET-type bioelectrocatalysis is limited.<sup>2,11,12</sup> Fructose dehydrogen-

ase<sup>13</sup> and hydrogenase<sup>2</sup> are often used for DET-type bioelectrocatalyst to oxidize fructose and hydrogen, respectively, as fuels and multi-copper oxidases (MCOs), such as laccase, bilirubin oxidase (BOD), and Cu efflux oxidase, are utilized for DETtype bioelectrocatalyst for O2-reduction.14<sup>17</sup> However the power density of high-performance DET-type biofuel cell (a few mW cm<sup>¹</sup><sup>2</sup> ) 14,18,19 is much lower than that of MET-type with the best performance (10 mW cm<sup>¹</sup><sup>2</sup> ).<sup>20</sup> Among the DETtype enzymes for bioanodes, one of promising enzymes is [NiFe]-hydrogenase due to their special bioelectrocatalytic ability to catalyze the 2-electron oxidation of H2 at high catalytic current density with minimum overpotential. 2,3,5 Moreover, non-Pt H2O2 enzymatic biofuel cells can be constructed by combining the bioanode with the biocathode modified with MCO.14,15

The discovery of O2- and CO-tolerant [NiFe]-hydrogenase is one of the breakthroughs essential for the construction of the aforementioned biofuel cell, and the unique properties have been investigated from several viewpoints.<sup>21</sup><sup>24</sup> DET-type H2 O2 biofuel cell with tolerant [NiFe]-hydrogenase has already been constructed.18,19 Lojou's group achieved the highest power density (1.5 mW cm<sup>¹</sup><sup>2</sup> at pH 6 and 60 °C) with [NiFe] hydrogenase from A. aerolicus and BOD from B. pumilus. 18 They recorded high H2-oxidation current (4 mA cm<sup>¹</sup><sup>2</sup> at pH 7 and 70 °C) under bubbling the gas into the electrolyte solution to minimize substrate depletion.18

One critical problem in utilization of [NiFe]-hydrogenase is the anaerobic inactivation which is a reversible inactivation caused by the anaerobic oxidation at high electrode potentials or high solution potentials.2,25 Several spectroscopic studies have revealed that the catalytic cycle proceeds in three state forms: Ni-SI (active silent form), Ni-R (H2-reduced form), Ni-C (one-electron-oxidized form of Ni-R), and that the inactivation generates a Ni(III) state form known as Ni-B by oneelectron oxidation of Ni-SI, in which a hydroxide ligand is coordinated to the Ni atom in a bridging position with respect to the Fe(II).2,22,26

Taking into account of this mechanism, we have proposed that the inactivation can be considered as a competitive inhibition-like reaction.<sup>27</sup> We utilized a membrane-bound O2 tolerant [NiFe]-hydrogenase from Hydrogenovibrio marinus (MBH) and succeeded in avoiding the inactivation by increasing the concentration of H2 over the saturated level in immersion system. For this purpose, we constructed an MBH-modified gas-diffusion-type electrode, which was often utilized for airbreathing biocathodes to increase the O2-uptake.14,28<sup>30</sup> The electrode makes it possible to directly uptake the gaseous substrate from the gas phase, and this attempt was the first case for H2-oxidizing bioanodes, as far as we know.<sup>27</sup> For discussing the effect in detail, it is very important to evaluate the thermodynamic and kinetic parameters of MBH.

In this research, we investigate the bioelectrochemical properties of MBH from the viewpoint of the anaerobic inactivation. The inactivation kinetics is studied by analyzing time and potential dependence of the DET-type catalytic current of MBH adsorbed on electrodes, while the enzyme kinetics of MBH on electrodes is evaluated from rotating rate dependence of the steady-state catalytic current using rotating disk electrode method. Moreover, the Michaelis constant for H2 is estimated by analyzing the H2-concentration dependence of the catalytic current of MBH. Finally, we have proposed an analytical model for the anaerobic inactivation and evaluated the inhibition constant and the apparent Michaelis constant. The results show that an MBH-modified gas-diffusion-type electrode is very effective and necessary for avoiding the inactivation.

# Experimental

Materials. Ketjen Black EC300J (KB) was kindly donated from Lion Co. (Japan). Carbon paper (CP, TGP-H-120) was purchased from Toray Co. (Japan). Poly(tetrafluoroethylene) fine powder (PTFE, 6-J) was obtained from DuPont Mitsui Fluorochemicals (Japan). 4-Nitrobenzenediazonium tetrafluoroborate and N-hydroxysuccinimide (98%, NHS) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co. (USA). 1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) was purchased from Dojindo Laboratory (Japan). MBH was purified according to the literature.<sup>31</sup> All other chemicals used in this study were of analytical grade and all solutions were prepared with distilled water.

Preparation of MBH-Adsorbed Electrode. Au electrode (3 mm in diameter, BAS) was polished with alumina slurry (Buehler, 1 ¯m), sonicated and washed with distilled water. A 15-μL aliquot of an MBH solution (7 ¯M dissolved in 10 mM phosphate buffer of pH 6) was applied on the Au electrodes and the electrodes were kept in water-saturated atmosphere for 2 h at room temperature to slowly dry the solvent.

KB-modified glassy carbon electrode (KB:PTFE = 8:2 (w/w)) (KBGCE) was prepared according to the literature,<sup>14</sup> in which a GCE for rotating disk voltammetry (RDE-2, BAS, Inc.) was used. The projective surface area of the GCE was 0.071 cm2 . When MBH was adsorbed on the KB-GCE, a 15-μL aliquot of an MBH solution (7 ¯M dissolved in 10 mM phosphate buffer of pH 6) was applied on the KBGCEs and the electrodes were kept in water-saturated atmosphere for 2 h at room temperature to slowly dry the solvent.

Immobilization of MBH on KBGCE. MBH was chemically immobilized on the KBGCE through the amidelinkage32,33 to avoid the desorption of MBH under strongly convective conditions. The bare KBGCE was electrochemically pretreated to generate 4-aminophenyl layer on the surface according to the literature with minor modification.<sup>34</sup> In brief, 4-nitrophenyl layer was produced on the electrode surface by the potential sweep method from 0.8 to ¹0.4 V at 200 mV s<sup>¹</sup><sup>1</sup> for 4 cycles in an acetonitrile solution containing 2 mM 4 nitrobenzenediazonium tetrafluoroborate and 50 mM tetrabutylammonium tetrakis(4-fluorophenyl)borate, and then reduced to 4-aminophenyl layer by the potential sweep method from ¹0.3 to ¹1.6 V at 200 mV s<sup>¹</sup><sup>1</sup> for 4 cycles in a water/ethanol mixed solution (9:1 in volume) containing 100 mM NaCl. The electrode is called NH2KBGCE. A 15-μL aliquot of an MBH/ reagent solution (7 ¯M MBH, 12 mM EDC, and 6 mM NHS dissolved in 10 mM phosphate buffer of pH 6) was applied on the NH2KBGCEs to immobilize MBH on the electrode through the amide-linkage.35 The electrodes were kept in watersaturated atmosphere for 2 h at room temperature to slowly dry the solvent.

Preparation of KB-Modified Carbon Paper Electrode. A gas-diffusion-type carbon paper electrode (KBCPE; KB:PTFE = 6:4 (w/w)) was prepared according to the literature.  $^{14,27}$  The active and projected surface area of the CPE was 0.03 cm<sup>2</sup>. A 10-μL aliquot of an MBH solution (10 μM dissolved in 10 mM phosphate buffer of pH 6) was applied on the KB–CPE, which was kept in water-saturated atmosphere for 6 h at 4 °C to slowly dry the solvent.

**Electrochemical Measurements.** Cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry were performed on electrochemical analyzers BAS CV-50W and ALS 714C. Steady-state chronoamperometry was carried out with the rotating disk KB–GCE. An Ag|AgCl|sat. KCl electrode and a Pt wire were used as the reference electrode and the counter electrode, respectively. Measurements were carried out in 100 mM phosphate buffer (pH 6) at  $40 \pm 2$  °C. The partial pressure of H<sub>2</sub> ( $p_{\rm H_2}$ ) is adjusted by mixing the Ar and H<sub>2</sub> gas by using flowmeters with flowcontrollers (PK2504FR, KOFLOC Co., Japan). A handmade gas-diffusion-type electrolysis cell, which is similar to that reported in previous papers for O<sub>2</sub>-reducing biocathode, <sup>14,27</sup> was used for measurements with the KB–CPE.

### Results and Discussion

**DET-Type Bioelectrocatalysis on MBH-Modified Electrodes in Immersion System.** Cyclic voltammograms (CVs) at an MBH-adsorbed Au electrode are shown in Figure 1A. In quiescent but  $H_2$ -saturated buffer solution, a typical oxidation wave (solid line) was observed in the electrode potential region from -0.5 to -0.2 V. The wave is ascribed to the MBH-catalyzed  $H_2$ -oxidation, as judged from the comparison with a wave under Ar-atmospheric conditions (Figure 1A, broken line). Since the  $H_2$ -oxidation current was practically independent of the scan rate (v) in the potential region from -0.5 to -0.2 V (data not shown), the catalytic current is controlled by the enzyme kinetics.

However, the catalytic current decreased in the forward scan from -0.2 to 0.2 V and was almost fully recovered in the reverse scan. The phenomenon is ascribed to the reversible and oxidative inactivation (called as anaerobic inactivation) to generate Ni-B. The anodic wave shape due to the inactivation depended on v (data not shown), indicating relatively slow inactivation. On the other hand, the reverse scan wave corresponds to the reactivation was almost independent of v, indicating fast reactivation.

When an MBH-adsorbed KB-GCE was rotated in the H2saturated solution (at a rotating rate ( $\omega$ ) of 2500 rpm (262 s<sup>-1</sup>)), a similar shape of the catalytic wave was observed (Figure 1B, solid line). The oxidation current density became much larger than that at MBH-adsorbed Au electrode. This effect is predominantly due to an increase in the electroactive surface area of the electrode by use of KB-GCE. However, under the quiescent conditions (0 rpm), the voltammogram showed only a small catalytic anodic peak around  $-0.45\,\mathrm{V}$  (Figure 1B, broken line). The H<sub>2</sub>-depletion near the electrode surface causes the drastic decrease in the current. Similar phenomena were observed and studied with carbon nanotube (CNT) electrodes.<sup>36</sup> The v dependence of the wave at the KB-GCE was very similar to that at Au electrodes (data not shown) except the fact that the decrease in the catalytic wave due to the inactivation at the KB-GCEs is slow compared with that at the Au electrode.

**Figure 1.** (A) CVs of the MBH-adsorbed Au electrode in H<sub>2</sub>- (solid line) and Ar-saturated (broken line) buffer solution under quiescent conditions. (B) CVs of the MBH-adsorbed KB-GCE at  $\omega=2500$  (solid line) and 0 rpm (broken line) under H<sub>2</sub>-atmospheric conditions (The solid line is identical with curve (a) of Figure 1 in Ref. 27.). The measurements were carried out in  $100\,\mathrm{mM}$  phosphate buffer (pH 6) at  $40\pm2\,^\circ\mathrm{C}$ . The scan rate was  $20\,\mathrm{mV}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ .

Kinetic Analysis of Reversible Anaerobic Inactivation. For studying the anaerobic inactivation and reactivation process, we assume a reversible first-order reaction scheme which connects the active  $(E_A)$  and inactive  $(E_I)$  forms of the enzyme according to the previous study.<sup>37</sup>

$$E_{A} \underset{k_{A}}{\overset{k_{I}}{\rightleftharpoons}} E_{I} \tag{1}$$

where  $k_{\rm I}$  and  $k_{\rm A}$  are the apparent inactivation and reactivation rate constants, respectively. We conducted the potentialstep chronoamperometric method to follow the inactivation and reactivation processes. In the beginning, the electrode potential  $(E_1)$  was set at -0.2 V, where the anaerobic inactivation does not occur and the maximum catalytic current density is observed (Figure 1, solid line). After then the potential was stepped at t = 0 to a given potential  $(E_2)$ , at which the anaerobic inactivation occurs. The open circles in Figure 2A indicate chronoamperogram (CA) of the H<sub>2</sub>-oxidation current at the MBH-adsorbed Au electrode at  $E_2 = -0.02 \,\mathrm{V}$ . The data just after the potential step (t < 3 s) involved the charging current and were eliminated for the present analysis. Since the catalytic current at the Au electrode is controlled by the enzyme kinetics as mentioned in the above section, the current decay reflects the reversible first-order inactivation as expressed by eq 2.

**Figure 2.** (A) CA of the MBH-adsorbed Au electrode (open circles) at -0.02 V under H<sub>2</sub>-atmospheric conditions. The solid curve was evaluated by a nonlinear regression analysis based on eq 2. The best fit was obtained with the parameters:  $I_0 = 0.22 \,\mu\text{A}$ ,  $k_1 = 0.13 \,\text{s}^{-1}$ ,  $k_A = 0.043 \,\text{s}^{-1}$ . The measurements were carried out in  $100 \,\text{mM}$  phosphate buffer (pH 6) at  $40 \pm 2 \,^{\circ}\text{C}$ . (B) The time dependence of  $I_{\text{cat}}$  (open circles) estimated from CA of MBH-adsorbed KB–GCE (Figure S2) on the basis of eqs 3 and 4. The solid curve was evaluated by a nonlinear regression analysis based on eq 2. The best fit was obtained with the parameters:  $I_0 = 103 \,\mu\text{A}$ ,  $k_1 = 0.09 \,\text{s}^{-1}$ ,  $k_A = 0.040 \,\text{s}^{-1}$ .

$$I_{\text{cat}}(t) = I_0 \left\{ \frac{k_{\text{I}}}{k_{\text{I}} + k_{\text{A}}} \exp[-(k_{\text{I}} + k_{\text{A}})t] + \frac{k_{\text{A}}}{k_{\text{I}} + k_{\text{A}}} \right\}$$
 (2)

where  $I_0$  is the fully activated catalytic current. Equation 2 was fitted to the date in Figure 2A in the time region from 3 to 30 s with  $I_0$ ,  $k_{\rm I}$  and  $k_{\rm A}$  as the adjustable parameters using a nonlinear regression analysis by Gnuplot<sup>®</sup>. The regression curve is shown in Figure 2A as a solid line. The experimental data are well reproduced by the model. We will discuss the evaluated values of the rate constants in the following section.

In the case of MBH-adsorbed KB-GCE, however, the potential-step chronoamperometric method cannot be simply applied to the kinetic analysis of the inactivation and reactivation, since outstanding depression of H<sub>2</sub> occurs near the KB-GCE due to large surface area as mentioned in the above section. In order to eliminate the H<sub>2</sub>-depression effect, we attempted to utilize rotating disk electrode method. In addition, we immobilized MBH chemically on the NH<sub>2</sub>-KB-GCE through the amide-linkage between the carboxy group and amino group by using EDC and NHS as the coupling reagents. The resultant electrode is called MBH-immobilized KB-GCE.

**Figure 3.** (A) CA of the MBH-immobilized KB–GCE at  $-0.2\,\mathrm{V}$  under  $\mathrm{H_2}$ -atmospheric conditions ( $p_{\mathrm{H_2}}=1\,\mathrm{atm}$ ).  $I_\mathrm{s}$  was first measured at  $\omega=2500\,\mathrm{rpm}$  and the  $\omega$  value was stepwise changed from 50 to 2500 rpm. The measurements were carried out in  $100\,\mathrm{mM}$  phosphate buffer (pH 6) at  $40\pm2\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . (B)  $\omega$  dependence of the steady-state  $\mathrm{H_2}$ -oxidation current (open circles) at the MBH-immobilized KB–GCE. The current was measured as shown in (A). The solid curve was evaluated by a nonlinear regression analysis based on eqs 3 and 4.

The CV at MBH-immobilized KB–GCE in  $H_2$ -saturated solution (Figure S1) shows a steady-state catalytic wave of  $H_2$ -oxidation (in the potential range from -0.35 to -0.2 V) at  $\omega = 2500$  rpm. The immobilization stabilized MBH on the electrode (see the next paragraph also), but led to a decrease in the current density. The reason is not clear at the present moment, since the evaluation of the surface concentration is very difficult. The appearance of the steady-state current indicates that any time-dependent change in the enzyme activity due for example to local pH change, if any, is negligible during the measurements. However, a couple of large redox waves were also observed. The waves are originated from the surface modifier (most probably hydroxylamine intermediate).

Figure 3A shows the CA under  $H_2$ -saturated conditions at various values of  $\omega$  and at  $E_1$  ( $-0.2\,\mathrm{V}$ ). The steady-state  $H_2$ -oxidation current ( $I_\mathrm{s}$ ) was first measured at 2500 rpm, and the  $\omega$  value was stepwise changed from 50 to 2500 rpm. The  $I_\mathrm{s}$  value at 2500 rpm ( $t > 350\,\mathrm{s}$ ) was recovered up to the initial value at  $0 < t < 50\,\mathrm{s}$  at 2500 rpm, indicating the stable immobilization of MBH on the KB–GCE. The  $\sqrt{\omega}$  dependence of  $I_\mathrm{s}$  under  $H_2$ -saturated conditions shows curved characteristics (Figure 3B). The result indicates that  $I_\mathrm{s}$  is governed by both the  $H_2$ -diffusion and the enzymatic kinetics. The characteristics can be as

expressed by Koutecky-Levich equation.<sup>38</sup>

$$\frac{1}{I_c} = \frac{1}{I_D} + \frac{1}{I_{cat}} \tag{3}$$

Here,  $I_D$  is the diffusion-controlled current at a rotating disk electrode:

$$I_{\rm D} = 0.62nFAD_{\rm H_2}^{2/3} v^{-1/6} c_{\rm H_2} \omega^{1/2} \tag{4}$$

where  $n, F, A, D_{H_2}$ , v, and  $c_{H_2}$  are, respectively, the number of electrons (2 in this case), the Faraday constant, the projected electrode surface area, the diffusion coefficient of H<sub>2</sub>, the kinematic viscosity of water (0.0066 cm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> at 40 °C),<sup>39,40</sup> and the concentration of dissolved H2. The saturated concentration of dissolved H2 was set to be 0.74 mM at 40 °C and  $p_{\rm H_2} = 1$  atm. 41 Equations 3 and 4 were fitted to the data in Figure 3B (open circles) with  $I_{\text{cat}}$  and  $D_{\text{H}_2}$  as the adjustable parameters using a nonlinear regression analysis by Gnuplot®, and the regression curve is shown in Figure 3B as a solid line. The refined values of  $I_{\rm cat}$  and  $D_{\rm H_2}$  were 543  $\pm$  8  $\mu \rm A$  and  $(4.01\pm0.03)\times10^{-5}\,\text{cm}^2\,\text{s}^{-1},$  respectively. The error is given as the asymptotic standard error. Consequently, we can now extract the true contribution of the enzyme kinetic-controlled catalytic current (i.e. Icat) from the total steady-state current  $I_{\rm s}$  with eqs 3 and 4. However, the current in the beginning of the potential step would be disturbed by the redox reaction of the surface modifier at the MBH-immobilized KB-GCE (Figure S1). Thus MBH was simply adsorbed on the KB-GCE and the time dependence of  $I_s$  (at  $\omega = 2500 \,\mathrm{rpm}$ ) due to the inactivation of MBH on the KB-GCE was measured by potential-step chronoamperometry (Figure S2), and the  $I_{cat}$ contribution was extracted from the observed  $I_s$  by using the evaluated  $I_D$ . The extracted values of  $I_{cat}$  are plotted as a function of the time in Figure 2B as open circles. We analyzed the decay characteristics of  $I_{cat}$  (from 4 to 30 s) with eq 2 in the same manner as that used for the data obtained at the Au electrode. The regression curve is shown in Figure 2B as a solid line. The decay characteristics are well explained by eq 2.

Potential Dependence of the Apparent Inactivation and Reactivation Rate Constants. Figure 4 shows the potential dependence of  $k_{\rm I}$  and  $k_{\rm A}$  at MBH-adsorbed Au electrode (open circles) and MBH-adsorbed KB-GCE (open triangles). Since the magnitude of the inactivation (the catalytic current decay) is very small in the low potential region (from -0.2 to -0.15 V), the evaluation of the rate constants were very difficult in the region. The evaluated values of  $k_{\rm I}$  at least in the potential range from -0.1 to 0.1 V seems to be independent of the potential (Figure 4A). In contrast, the logarithmic values of  $k_A$  decrease linearly with the electrode potential and reach a limiting value at high potentials  $(E > 0.05 \,\mathrm{V})$  (Figure 4B). These characters are coincident with those described in a previous study using tolerant A. aeolicus [NiFe]-hydrogenase.<sup>37</sup> The inactivation process involves the one-electron oxidation of the Ni(II) in the [NiFe] catalytic center and the hydroxide ligand coordination to the Ni(III). $^{2,22,26}$  The fact that  $k_{\rm I}$  is independent of the electrode potential means that the rate of the hydroxide ligand coordination to the Ni(III) (the coordination of water on the [NiFe]active site and the succeeding deprotonation) is the ratedetermining step of the inactivation. Some conformational change around the [NiFe]-active might also be involved. The

**Figure 4.** The potential dependence of the apparent rate constants of the inactivation (A) and the reactivation (B). The open circles and triangles correspond to the results obtained at Au electrode and KB–GCE, respectively. The error bars were evaluated by the Student *t*-distribution at 90% confidence level.

 $k_{\rm I}$  values evaluated for the MBH adsorbed on the KB–GCE is smaller than those for the MBH adsorbed on the Au electrode (Figure 4A). Some restriction in the movement of MBH adsorbed in the mesopore of the KB–BCE seems to decelerate the hydroxide ligand coordination to the Ni(III). Actually, the chemical immobilization of MBH on an Au electrode caused a decrease in the  $k_{\rm I}$  value (data not shown).

On the other hand, the potential dependence of  $k_{\rm A}$  (Figure 4B) indicates that the rate-determining process of the reactivation process is one-electron reduction of the Ni(III) atom in the Ni-B state. The electrode materials do not affect the reduction rate of the Ni(III), since the  $k_{\rm A}$  values at the MBH-adsorbed KB–GCE is identical with those at the MBH-adsorbed Au electrode (Figure 4B).

Competitive Inhibition-Like Model for the Anaerobic Inactivation. As to the anaerobic inactivation, the generation of Ni-B (the inactive state form) from Ni-SI seems to compete with the catalytic reduction of Ni-SI to Ni-R by  $H_2$  as described in the previous studies. Thus, the reaction scheme can be simply represented in Figure 5. In the case of the competitive inhibition-like catalytic reaction,  $I_{cat}$  can be expressed by eqs 5 and 6 using steady-state approximation.

$$I_{\text{cat}} = nFA \frac{k_{\text{cat}} \Gamma_{\text{enz,eff}}}{1 + \frac{K'_{\text{M}}}{c_{\text{H}_2}}} = \frac{I_{\text{max}}}{1 + \frac{K'_{\text{M}}}{c_{\text{H}_2}}}$$
(5)

while  $K'_{M}$  is the apparent Michaelis constant given by

$$K'_{\rm M} = \left(1 + \frac{k_2}{k_{-2}}\right) K_{\rm M} = (1 + K_{\rm I}) K_{\rm M}$$
 (6)

where  $k_{\text{cat}}$ ,  $\Gamma_{\text{enz,eff}}$ ,  $K_{\text{M}}$ ,  $k_2$ , and  $k_{-2}$  are, respectively, the catalytic constant and the total effective surface concentration of MBH, the Michaelis constant, the inactivation rate constant and the reactivation rate constant. Since it is difficult to evaluate  $\Gamma_{\text{enz,eff}}$  at the present moment, we will not discuss the independent evaluation of  $k_{\text{cat}}$  in this work.

We have already evaluated and discussed the apparent inactivation rate constant  $(k_{\rm I})$  and reactivation rate constant  $(k_{\rm A})$  in the above sections, respectively. However, the physical meaning of the rate constants are not necessarily identical with the enzyme kinetic parameters. Therefore, let us here consider the relation between the apparent rate constant  $(k_{\rm I}, k_{\rm A})$  and the true value  $(k_2, k_{-2})$  based on the Figure 5. We assume that the H<sub>2</sub>-binding reaction to the Ni-SI state form is at rapid equilibrium  $(k_{-1} \gg k_{\rm cat})$ . The  $K_{\rm M}$  is defined as

$$K_{\rm M} = \frac{k_{-1}}{k_1} = \frac{\Gamma_{\rm Ni\text{-}SI}c_{\rm H_2}}{\Gamma_{\rm Ni\text{-}R}}$$
 (7)

where  $k_1$ ,  $k_{-1}$ ,  $\Gamma_{\text{Ni-SI}}$  and  $\Gamma_{\text{Ni-R}}$  are, respectively, the forward and backward rate constants of the H<sub>2</sub>-binding reaction to the Ni-SI state form, the effective surface concentrations of Ni-SI and Ni-R state forms. Under the conditions,  $I_{\text{cat}}$  can be expressed by eq 8.

$$I_{\text{cat}} = nFAk_{\text{cat}}\Gamma_{\text{Ni-R}} = nFAk_{\text{cat}}\frac{c_{\text{H}_2}}{K_{\text{M}}}\Gamma_{\text{Ni-SI}}$$
(8)

**Figure 5.** The reaction scheme of the anaerobic inactivation. Ni-SI, Ni-R, and Ni-B are, respectively, the active silent form of MBH,  $H_2$ -reduced form of Ni-SI and one-electron-oxidized form of Ni-SI caused by the anaerobic inactivation.  $k_1$ ,  $k_{-1}$ ,  $k_2$ ,  $k_{-2}$ , and  $k_{\text{cat}}$  are, respectively, the forward and backward rate constants of  $H_2$ -binding reaction, the inactivation and reactivation rate constant and the catalytic constant.

The time dependence of  $\Gamma_{\text{Ni-SI},t}$  during inactivation and activation in the presence of  $H_2$  is described as follows.

$$\frac{d\Gamma_{\text{Ni-SI},t}}{dt} = k_{-2}\Gamma_{\text{Ni-B},t} + (k_{-1} + k_{\text{cat}})\Gamma_{\text{Ni-R},t} - (k_{1}c_{\text{H}_{2}} + k_{2})\Gamma_{\text{Ni-SI},t}$$
(9)

where  $\Gamma_{\text{Ni-B},t}$  is the effective surface concentration of the Ni-B state form at t. Considering the mass balance of the surface concentration of MBH and the fully-activated conditions for MBH, we can obtain eq 10

$$\Gamma_{\text{enz,eff}} = \Gamma_{\text{Ni-SL}t} + \Gamma_{\text{Ni-R},t} + \Gamma_{\text{Ni-B},t} \tag{10}$$

with the initial condition (at t = 0 at  $E_1 = -0.2 \,\mathrm{V}$ )

$$\Gamma_{\text{enz,eff}} = \Gamma_{\text{Ni-SI},0} + \Gamma_{\text{Ni-R},0} \tag{11}$$

Solving eq 9 with eqs 7, 10, and 11,  $\Gamma_{\text{Ni-SI},t}$  is expressed by eq 12

 $\Gamma_{ ext{Ni-SI},t}$ 

$$= \Gamma_{\text{Ni-SI},0} \left[ \frac{k_2}{k_2 + k'_{-2}} \exp\{-(k_2 + k'_{-2})t\} + \frac{k'_{-2}}{k_2 + k'_{-2}} \right]$$
(12)

while  $k'_{-2}$  is given by

$$k'_{-2} = \left(1 + \frac{c_{\rm H_2}}{K_{\rm M}}\right) k_{-2} \tag{13}$$

Thus, the decay of the catalytic current is given by

$$I_{\text{cat}}(t) = I_0 \left[ \frac{k_2}{k_2 + k'_{-2}} \exp\{-(k_2 + k'_{-2})t\} + \frac{k'_{-2}}{k_2 + k'_{-2}} \right]$$
(14)

Compering the eqs 2 and 14, we can conclude that  $k_1 = k_2$ , and that  $k_A = k'_{-2} = (1 + \frac{c_{\rm H_2}}{K_{\rm M}})k_{-2}$ . Consequently, the inhibition constant can be given as

$$K_{\rm I} = \frac{k_2}{k_{\rm A}} = \frac{k_{\rm I}}{k_{\rm A}} \left( 1 + \frac{c_{\rm H_2}}{K_{\rm M}} \right)$$
 (15)

Therefore, it is important to evaluate  $K_{\rm M}$  for DET-type  ${\rm H_2\text{-}oxidation}$  of MBH on the electrode. A simple and easy electrochemical method for determining  $K_{\rm M}$  of adsorbed [NiFe]-hydrogenase was reported by Léger et al. 42 The time dependence of the catalytic current during the convective  ${\rm H_2\text{-}}$  gas removal was analyzed under the assumption that the removal of the gas from solution on flushing with an inert gas follows the simple exponential kinetics and that the  ${\rm H_2\text{-}}$  concentration is homogeneous in solution during the inert gas flushing and the enzyme reaction near the electrode surface. However, in order to evaluate an accurate value of  $K_{\rm M}$  of the adsorbed MBH, it will be recommended to analyze  ${\rm H_2\text{-}}$  concentration dependence of the steady-state catalytic current ( $I_{\rm cat}$ ) at rotating disk electrodes with a constant amount of adsorbed MBH.

Figure 6A shows the CA at the MBH-immobilized KB–GCE and at several  $p_{\rm H_2}$  (0.05–1 atm). The measurement potential was set at -0.2 V, where the anaerobic inactivation does not occur. First, in the light zone ( $p_{\rm H_2}=1$  atm),  $I_{\rm s}$  was measured at  $\omega=2500$  rpm (as indicated by the arrow). Next, the  $\omega$  value was stepwise changed from 50 to 2500 rpm. The time dependence of the  $I_{\rm s}$  during the  $\omega$  change (the left side light zone in Figure 6A) is magnified and depicted in Figure 3A. Quick response to  $\omega$  was obtained. Subsequently, in the shaded

Figure 6. (A) CA of the MBH-immobilized KB-GCE at  $-0.2 \,\mathrm{V}$  and at several  $p_{\mathrm{H}}$ , (0.05–1 atm). In the light zone,  $p_{\rm H_2}$  was set to be 1 atm. First,  $I_{\rm s}$  at  $p_{\rm H_2}=1$  atm was measured at  $\omega = 2500 \, \text{rpm}$  (as indicated by an arrow). Next, the  $\omega$  value was stepwise changed from 50 to 2500 rpm.  $p_{\rm H_2}$  was set to be 1 atm at the position indicated by the arrows to check the stability of MBH on the electrode surface. In the shaded zone,  $p_{\rm H_2}$  was changed from 0.9 to 0.05 atm. After the current reaches to the constant at  $\omega = 2500 \, \text{rpm}$ , the  $\omega$  value was stepwise changed from 50 to 2500 rpm. The CA profile in the left side light zone is identical with that given in Figure 3A. (B)  $\omega$  dependence of  $I_s$  at the MBH-immobilized KB-GCE at  $p_{H_2}$  = 0.05-0.9. The current was measured as shown in (A). (C)  $I_{\text{cat}}$  contribution as a function of  $c_{\text{H}_2}$  for the MBH-catalyzed H<sub>2</sub>-oxidation.

zone,  $p_{\rm H_2}$  was changed from 0.9 to 0.05 atm step by step. When  $p_{\rm H_2}$  was changed,  $\omega$  was hold at 2500 rpm until the  $I_{\rm s}$  value reached a constant value (at which the H<sub>2</sub>-concentration reached a constant value). After then, the  $\omega$  value was stepwise changed from 50 to 2500 rpm. As judged from  $I_{\rm s}$  at  $\omega$  = 2500 rpm and  $p_{\rm H_2}$  = 1 atm (as indicated by the arrows in light

zone), the MBH-immobilized KB–GCE shows almost the identical value of the steady-state H<sub>2</sub>-oxidation current. The result verifies the relatively high stability of the MBH-immobilized KB–GCE over the 2-h continuous measurements under strong convection.

In the case at  $p_{\rm H_2}=1$  atm,  $I_{\rm cat}$  has already been evaluated in the section: **Kinetic Analysis of Reversible Anaerobic Inactivation**. The  $\omega$  dependence of  $I_{\rm s}$  at several  $p_{\rm H_2}$  (0.05–0.9 atm) also shows curved characteristics (Figure 6B). Equations 3 and 4 were fitted to the data taken at  $p_{\rm H_2}=0.05$ –0.9 atm in Figure 6B with  $I_{\rm cat}$  and  $c_{\rm H_2}$  as the adjustable parameters using a nonlinear regression analysis by Gnuplot<sup>®</sup>. The analytical results are collected in Figure 6C. The error bar is given as the asymptotic standard error. Under the conditions where the anaerobic inactivation does not occur,  $I_{\rm cat}$  is given by an equation similar to Michaelis–Menten equation<sup>43</sup>

$$I_{\text{cat}} = nFA \frac{I_{\text{max}}}{1 + \frac{K_{\text{M}}}{c_{\text{H}_2}}} \tag{16}$$

Equation 16 was fitted to the  $c_{\rm H_2}$  dependence of  $I_{\rm cat}$  depicted in Figure 6C with  $I_{\rm max}$  and  $K_{\rm M}$  as the adjustable parameters using a nonlinear regression analysis by Gnuplot<sup>®</sup>. The regression shows that  $I_{\rm max}=970\pm70\,\mu{\rm A}$  and that  $K_{\rm M}=0.57\pm0.08$  mM. The  $K_{\rm M}$  value of the immobilized MBH is rather large compared with that of MBH in solution measured by an activity assay (12  $\mu{\rm M}$ ). The result might be due to the effect of MBH-immobilization or the differences in the reaction character between the interfacial reaction (DET-type bioelectrocatalysis) and the solution reaction (activity assay using mediators as an electron accepter).

The  $k_{\rm I}/k_{\rm A}$  value increases with the electrode potential and reaches an almost constant value (6.2 at Au electrode and 4.5 at KB–GCE as judged from Figure 4A) at  $E > 0.05 \, \rm V$ . If we accept the  $K_{\rm M}$  value as 0.57 mM evaluated here, the  $K_{\rm M}'$  value is estimated as 8.7 (at Au electrode) and 6.5 mM (at KB-GCE) with eqs 6 and 15. Since the  $K_{\rm M}'$  value is larger than the saturated H<sub>2</sub>-concentration (0.74 mM), it seems to be difficult to avoid the anaerobic inactivation in immersion system. This prediction is supported by the fact given in Figure 1B as a solid line. As described previously, we have already avoided the inactivation with a gas-diffusion system.<sup>27</sup> We can say that the effect is due to the increasing H<sub>2</sub>-concentration achieved by high-speed H<sub>2</sub>-supply to MBH over the  $K_{\rm M}'$  value.

**MBH-Adsorbed Gas-Diffusion-Type Bioanode.** An MBH-adsorbed KB-CPE was fabricated as a gas-diffusion-type bioanode. CVs of the MBH-adsorbed KB-CPEs were recorded under quiescent (passive) and H<sub>2</sub>-atmospheric conditions and are depicted in Figure 7 as a solid line. The current density is as large as about 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> at 0 V. Not only the inactivation is avoided, but the value is larger than that observed by MBH-adsorbed KB-GCE under stirred conditions as shown in Figure 1B.

In near future, a one-compartment dual gas-diffusion and DET-type  $H_2$ – $O_2$  biofuel cell will be constructed. The new type of  $H_2$ – $O_2$  biofuel cell allows us to supply  $H_2$  and  $O_2$  separately, thus enables us to get rid of the following problems. One is the risk of explosion, and the other is competitive limitation of dissolved gas-concentration governed by  $p_{\rm H_2}$  and  $p_{\rm O_2}$ .

**Figure 7.** CVs of catalytic  $H_2$ -oxidation of MBH-adsorbed KB-CPE under  $H_2$ - (solid line) and Ar flow (broken line) in the gas phase. The measurements were carried out in 100 mM phosphate buffer (pH 6) deaerated by Ar at  $40 \pm 2$  °C. The scan rate was  $20 \, \text{mV s}^{-1}$  (The data are almost identical with Figure 2 in Ref. 27, but some improvement was achieved in the current density by repeated experiments.).

### Conclusion

We have evaluated the rate constants of the inactivation and reactivation processes of the anaerobic inactivation and the  $K_{\rm M}$ value for H2 of MBH immobilized on the electrode based on steady-state electrochemical analysis. The inactivation process is independent of the electrode potential at least at  $E > -0.1 \,\mathrm{V}$ , while the rate-determining step of the reactivation process seems to be the one-electron reduction of the Ni(III) atom in the [NiFe] center. The  $K'_{\rm M}$  value (8.7 mM at Au electrode and 6.5 mM at KB-GCE) based on a competitive inhibition-like reaction is larger than the saturated H<sub>2</sub>-concentration (0.74 mM), indicating that the adsorbed MBH is subject to the inhibition even in H<sub>2</sub>-saturated solutions, as evidenced by the experimental results presented here. Thus, it is effective and necessary for avoiding the inactivation to utilize the gasdiffusion system. The gas-diffusion-type bioanode (MBHadsorbed KB-GCE) have recorded the highest H2-oxidation current (10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>) even under the quiescent conditions and it would dramatically improve the performance of DET-type H<sub>2</sub>-O<sub>2</sub> biofuel cell.

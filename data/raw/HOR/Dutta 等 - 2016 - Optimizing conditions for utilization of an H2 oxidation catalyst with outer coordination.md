# Optimizing conditions for utilization of an H<sub>2</sub> oxidation catalyst with outer coordination sphere functionalities†

Arnab Dutta,‡ Bojana Ginovska, Simone Raugei, John A. S. Roberts§ and Wendy J. Shaw\*

As a starting point for evaluating a broader range of conditions for  $H_2$  oxidation complexes, in this work we investigate an efficient and reversible Ni-based  $H_2$  oxidation and production complex with an arginine in the outer coordination sphere,  $[Ni(P^{Cy}_2N^{Arginine}_2)_2]^{7+}$  (**CyArg**). We tested this complex under a wide range of pressures and temperatures, in two different solvents (methanol and water), to determine if simultaneous improvements in rate and overpotential could be achieved. We found that the optimal conditions combined both high temperature (72 °C) and pressure (100 atm  $H_2$ ) in acidic aqueous solution (pH = 1), resulting in the fastest  $H_2$  oxidation reported for any homogeneous electrocatalyst to date (TOF  $1.1 \times 10^6 \text{ s}^{-1}$ ) operating at 240 mV overpotential. The activation free energy in water was determined to be 10 kcal mol<sup>-1</sup> at all pressures studied. Surprisingly, in methanol under the same temperature and pressure, **CyArg** had a TOF for  $H_2$  oxidation of only 280 s<sup>-1</sup> at an overpotential of 750 mV. Comparisons to the data in water, and to a control complex,  $[Ni(P^{Cy}_2N^{Benzyl}_2)_2]^{2+}$  (**CyBn**; Bn = benzyl), suggest that this substantial difference is likely due to a change in rate limiting step from  $H_2$  addition to deprotonation. Importantly, the optimal conditions we identified for **CyArg** (elevated temperature and acidic aqueous solutions), are amenable to fuel cell technologies and provide an important advancement in implementing homogeneous synthetic catalysts for renewable energy.

#### Introduction

Hydrogenases have received increasing interest in the past decade due to their ability to rapidly and efficiently interconvert  $\rm H_2$  and protons (eqn (1)). Using the abundant metals nickel and iron, hydrogenases are as fast as  $6000~\rm s^{-1}$  for  $\rm H_2$  oxidation and  $20~000~\rm s^{-1}$  for  $\rm H_2$  evolution. This reaction is of importance for interconverting electrical and chemical energy, representative of reactions that would enable the widespread use of energy from intermittent renewable sources such as solar and wind power. While hydrogenases have been utilized in fuel cells, their practical implementation is limited. A,5 Inspired by hydrogenases, a major focus in the organometallic

community has been developing catalysts using abundant metals.  $^{6\text{--}11}$ 

$$H_2 \ \rightleftharpoons \ 2H^+ + 2e^- \tag{1}$$

Our work has focused on investigating the role of an outer coordination sphere on the established  $[Ni(P^R_2N^{R'}_2)_2]^{2+}$  hydrogenase mimics. 6,12 Using this approach, we have demonstrated that incorporating single amino acids to create an outer coordination sphere results in increased rates and reduced catalytic overpotentials for both  $H_2$  oxidation and production. 13

Incorporating amino acids directly into the  $P_2N_2$  ring of  $H_2$  oxidation catalysts  $[Ni(P^{Cy}_2N^{AminoAcid}_2)_2]^{n+}$  (Cy = cyclohexyl; amino acids = glycine, n = 3; or arginine, n = 7) results in water soluble complexes. The arginine containing complex (CyArg; Fig. 1) exhibited  $H_2$  oxidation with a turnover frequency (TOF) =  $210 \text{ s}^{-1}$  and an overpotential of ~120 mV under 1 atm of  $H_2$  in pH 1.0 water at room temperature. Fast rates and low overpotentials were proposed to be facilitated by two outer coordination sphere elements: The -COOH group of the amino acid relaying protons from the metal via the pendant amine proton relay, and also by an interaction between the arginine side chains proposed to aid in  $H_2$  addition. Increasing the pressure at constant, ambient temp-

erature resulted in an increase in catalytic TOF to  $144\,000~\rm s^{-1}$  under 100 atm  $\rm H_2$  at pH  $0.^{15}$  However, the increased TOF is accompanied by a significantly higher overpotential (~400 mV), *i.e.* a decrease in the energy efficiency. The increased rate at low pH was attributed to the protonation of one pendant amine lowering the p $K_a$  of the additional pendant amines.  $^{15,16}$ 

Recently, we showed that increasing the temperature above 45 °C reduced the overpotential for CyArg at atmospheric pressure, resulting in catalytic reversibility.16 This result demonstrates that increasing the temperature can contribute to catalysis in more ways than merely increasing the TOF and suggested that improved catalytic performance might be achieved by combining both high pressures and temperatures. 16 Water has also been shown to be important for lowering overpotentials for H<sub>2</sub> oxidation complexes in this family, <sup>17</sup> but comparisons to other protic solvents have not yet been made to understand the generality of this effect. Here, we report the H<sub>2</sub> oxidation activity for CyArg under high pressure and elevated temperature in acidic water. To provide further insight into the role of the medium, methanol was also used as a solvent, the use of which enabled the comparison of a control complex with no outer coordination sphere functional groups,  $[Ni(P^{Cy}_2N^{Bn}_2)_2]^{2+}$  (CyBn; Bn = Benzyl).

#### Results

# Catalytic H<sub>2</sub> oxidation for CyArg at elevated temperature and high pressure in water

**TOFs.** Electrocatalytic  $H_2$  oxidation by **CyArg** at pH 1.0 was measured at four different temperatures (25, 45, 55, and 72 °C) under a range of  $H_2$  pressures (1–100 atm) employing a high-pressure electrochemical apparatus developed by our group. <sup>15</sup> Fig. 2 displays the TOF as a function of temperature and

pressure (see Methods section for details and calculations). The  $i_{\rm cat}$  was measured at 0.45 V for each temperature, chosen because the current plateaus at this potential at 25 °C. At higher temperatures, the potential was kept constant to avoid contributions from additional oxidative processes that may occur at more positive potentials. The TOF increased at elevated temperatures and reached 1.1 × 10<sup>6</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> at 72 °C under 100 atm H<sub>2</sub> (Fig. 2 and Table 1).

**Arrhenius parameters.** The rate enhancement is expected based upon the temperature increase, and yields an activation free energy  $(E_a)$  of  $10 \pm 2$  kcal  $\text{mol}^{-1}$  (Fig. 3). Similar improvement in  $H_2$  oxidation activity was observed at all temperatures with increasing  $H_2$  pressure (Fig. 2 and S1†), and a constant  $E_a$  was observed as a function of pressure, within error.

**Overpotentials.** Overpotential is a measure of the energy efficiency of the catalyst and is as essential as TOF to the evaluation of the catalytic performance. The overpotential is measured as the difference between the equilibrium potential  $(E_{\text{H}^{-}/\frac{1}{2}\text{H}_2})$  and  $E_{\text{cat}/2}$  (the potential where the catalytic current is 50% of  $i_{\text{cat}}$ ) (Fig. S2†). Inportantly, the overpotential for H<sub>2</sub> oxidation decreased significantly with increasing temperature, as shown in Fig. 4 by normalizing the catalytic currents at 0.5 V, revealing the more rapid increase in catalytic current at higher temperatures. At 100 atm H<sub>2</sub>, the overpotential was reduced by almost 140 mV from 25 °C to 72 °C.

# H<sub>2</sub> oxidation by CyArg and CyBn under elevated temperature and high pressure in methanol

TOFs were determined in methanol to investigate rates with higher dissolved  $H_2$  at atmospheric pressure<sup>24,25</sup> and to determine the role of different protic solvents. Water and acid concentrations were optimized to yield the highest rates (Fig. S3†). In methanol, the  $H_2$  oxidation activity for **CyArg** improved only eight-fold with pressures up to 100 atm  $H_2$ , and resulted in an

increased overpotential as a function of pressure (Fig. 5 and Table 1). As in water, catalytic currents were taken at 0.45 V to avoid contributions from other oxidation processes at more positive potentials. As observed in water, increasing the temperature in methanol lowered the overpotential, but it did not increase the TOF, resulting in a TOF three orders of magnitude slower than in water. The non-Nernstian catalytic waves for CyArg in methanol are consistent with slow electron transfer (Fig. 5). A second complex,  $[Ni(P^{Cy}_2N^{Bn}_2)_2]^{2+}$  (CyBn), was investigated in methanol as a control without the -COOH group or the guanidinium groups (Fig. S4 and S5†). Overall, the TOFs were slower for CyBn than CyArg (~3.5 times) and had lower overpotentials (Table 1). The dependence upon H2 pressure for CyBn was similar to that for CyArg (Fig. 6). H2 oxidation catalysis by both CyArg and CyBn under high pressures of H2 in methanol were homogeneous in nature (Fig. S6†).

#### Isomer distribution

The addition of H<sub>2</sub> to CyArg results in three isomers, endoendo (ee), endo-exo (ex), and exo-exo (xx), Fig. 7. The equilibrium distributions in acidic methanol and acidic water were evaluated using <sup>31</sup>P NMR spectroscopy and show a distribution of **ee** and **ex** in water, but predominantly **xx** in methanol.

#### Computational evalution of $pK_a$ values

The  $pK_a$  values of the protonated amines were estimated using established empirical relationships (see Methods and Table S2 $\dagger$ ), and show that there is little change in the p $K_a$ (<1) of the pendant amine in water and methanol. These computational results are consistent with experimental observations of other protonated amine groups in water and methanol. 19 In contrast, the  $pK_a$  for carboxylic acids is expected to be  $\sim$ 5 p $K_a$  units more basic in methanol compared to water based on previously determined relationships (eqn (2)).19,20

#### Discussion

Efficient H2 oxidation catalysts made with abundant metals are important in the widespread implementation of fuel cells. Testing a variety of conditions to determine which may result in the most active and efficient catalysts can provide insight into ideal conditions, as well as providing mechanistic insight into the catalysts themselves. Here we report the effects of temperature, pressure, and solvent on the activity of a catalyst for  $H_2$  oxidation.

In water, increasing the temperature increased the catalytic TOF at all pressures studied, to a maximum of  $1.1 \times 10^6 \text{ s}^{-1}$  at 100 atm H<sub>2</sub> and 72 °C. At all pressures, the activation free energy was found to be  $10 \pm 1$  kcal mol<sup>-1</sup>. The fixed barrier suggests that the rate determining step, previously determined to be H<sub>2</sub> addition at room temperature, <sup>15</sup> does not change over the temperature and pressure range studied. Importantly, as a combination of temperature and pressure were employed, the overpotential decreased. Previously, we observed an increase in overpotential for H2 oxidation by CyArg with increasing H2 pressure at constant temperature (25 °C), an observation that was attributed to sluggish electron transfer at elevated pressures. 15 Previously, we also reported that high temperatures can facilitate faster electron transfer to achieve reversible catalysis at atmospheric pressures. 16 Our current data are also consistent with elevated temperatures increasing the rate of electron transfer step(s) in the catalytic cycle (Fig. S7†). This is based on the observed steeper catalytic response<sup>18</sup> with increasing temperatures even at elevated pressures (Fig. 2 and 4), resulting in lower overpotentials. The combination of moderate overpotentials and fast TOFs achieved for CvArg with high pressure and elevated temperature at low pH result in remarkable catalytic performance under conditions that are relevant for PEM fuel cells, albeit at higher H2 pressures.21-23

We chose methanol to study solvent effects since methanol has 2.5-times higher solubility of H<sub>2</sub> than water<sup>24,25</sup> while maintaining the protic nature of the solvent and was expected to lead to even higher rates. Surprisingly, the TOFs were slower in methanol than in water under all conditions studied, three orders of magnitude slower at 100 atm and 72 °C. The TOFs in methanol as a function of pressure suggest a different mechanism in methanol than in water. The TOFs become independent of H2 pressure, consistent with either electron transfer or proton transfer being rate limiting, in stark contrast to the linear dependence upon H2 pressure for the TOF of CyArg in water. 25 While the non-Nernstian nature of the waves at high pressure are indicative of slow electron transfer, the slower overall rates, even at atmospheric pressure where plateaus are achieved, suggests that proton transfer is rate limiting in methanol. Surprisingly, the addition of water into methanol did not significantly enhance the rate, an additive that would be expected to overcome any proton transfer limitations based on the performance of the complex in pure water. Computational analysis shows that a plausible interpretation to explain these results is that the  $pK_a$  of the carboxylic acid changes as a function of the two solvents, limiting or slowing deprotonation. The similar behavior as a function of H<sub>2</sub> pressure and temperature for CyBn in methanol suggests that the -COOH group is not contributing critically to the activity of CyArg in methanol; the slower rates for CyBn compared to CyArg however, do suggest a unique contribution of the outer coordination sphere, contributing a factor of fourfold to the TOF at all temperatures.

The observations above also imply a significant role of water. On its own, water can facilitate deprotonation from the protonated pendant amine to the solvent. Recently, deprotona-

tion from the pendant amine in water was found to be thermodynamically more favorable compared to acetonitrile, a common organic solvent for experimental studies, due to a combination of sterics, desolvation, and proton transfer. 17,24,25 Because of the similarity in dielectric constant and molecular size between methanol and acetonitrile, it may be that similar effects dominate deprotonation even in methanol, despite its protic nature. The location of the pendant amine is also important to the TOFs as it controls H2 addition and deprotonation.25,26 We reported previously that the isomer distribution in water favors the amines positioned proximal to the metal (endo), 14-16 while NMR studies here show that methanol places protons exo to the metal, similar to acetonitrile, 26,27 a position which would slow H2 addition and deprotonation. Increases in TOF (1.2-70 times)12,24-29 for  $[Ni(P_2^RN_2^{R'})_2]^{2+}$  complexes as a function of small amounts of water added to acetonitrile have been reported previously, but only the  $[Ni(P^{Ph}_{2}N^{C_{6}H_{4}-X}_{2})_{2}]^{2+}$  hydrogen production catalysts report similar rate enhancements observed due to the addition of water. 31,35 This observation may point to a common mechanism for water in both H2 oxidation and H2 production in at least some of the [Ni(PR2NR2)2]2+ systems, but the large variability of the influence of water suggests that both water and features of the complex are important in achieving significant rate enhancements. Additional experimental and computational studies are needed to further delineate the roles of solvent and the contribution of the outer coordination sphere. As other water soluble catalysts are developed, more detailed mechanistic insight into the individual roles of water and the appended outer coordination sphere will be possible.

## Summary

The combination of high pressure, elevated temperature, and the solvent of acidic water resulted in fast TOFs accompanied by modest overpotentials for H<sub>2</sub> oxidation with CyArg (TOF =  $1.1 \times 10^6$  s<sup>-1</sup> with 240 mV overpotential at 72 °C under 100 atm H<sub>2</sub>). The use of methanol as the solvent significantly slowed the rate, attributed to a change in the rate limiting step in the catalytic mechanism, most consistent with limiting proton transfer. Importantly, elevated temperature reduced the overpotential, attributed to faster electron transfer, resulting in an overpotential approaching that of the enzymes. The conditions under which the fastest H<sub>2</sub> oxidation is achieved, i.e. highly acidic solutions and temperatures of ~70 °C, are those most relevant in PEM fuel cells.21 Consequently, this research represents an important step forward in enabling the use of abundant metals as catalysts for renewable energy utilization.

## Experimental methods

#### General procedures

 $[Ni(P^{Cy}_2N^{Arginine}_2)_2]^{2+}$  (CyArg) and  $[Ni(P^{Cy}_2N^{Benzyl}_2)_2]^{2+}$  (CyBn) were prepared under an N2 atmosphere in glove box following reported procedures. 15 Ultra-pure water, 18.2 M $\Omega$  cm, was

obtained from a Millipore unit. 99.9% dry methanol was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich and used without further purification. Ultra-high purity H2 was used for all H2 additions. Solution state 31P(1H) NMR data was collected in Varian VNMR spectrometers (300 MHz or 500 MHz <sup>1</sup>H frequency). 85% H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> was used as an external reference for <sup>31</sup>P NMR chemical shifts; <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectra were referenced to the residual solvent

Electrochemistry. Cyclic voltammetry was performed with solutions of 0.1 M Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> electrolyte in water using a glassycarbon electrode (1 mm diameter), polished with 0.25 micron MetaDi diamond polishing paste (Buehler). Solutions at pH 1.0 were prepared using 0.1 M HClO<sub>4</sub> aqueous solution. Appropriate amounts of bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonamide acid (HTFSI) was used as acid for the preparation of acidic methanolic solution. Cyclic voltammetry experiments were performed from 25 to 72 °C on a CH Instruments 600D electrochemical analyzer using a standard three-electrode configuration. The temperature was monitored with a thermocouple inserted into the apparatus. A glassy carbon rod was used as the counterelectrode and a AgCl-coated Ag wire (in saturated KCl) separated from the analyte solution by a Vycor frit was used as the reference electrode. All couples in aqueous solution were referenced to the equilibrium potential observed at each pH condition along with the internal standard hydroxymethyl ferrocenium/ferrocene couple at 380.0 mV vs. SHE. 16 For electrochemical experiments in methanol, the data was referenced to the ferrocene couple (FeCp $_2^{+/0}$ ). The fastest H<sub>2</sub> oxidation activity for both CyArg and CyBn at room temperature and 1 atm H2 was observed in methanol containing 0.28 M water and 25 mM bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonamide acid (HTFSI; Fig. S3 and S4†), conditions which were adopted for all studies in methanol.

The diffusion coefficient for CyArg at room temperature was measured by NMR-pulsed field gradient methods at 298 K and the value was  $2.8 \times 10^{-6}$  cm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> in water. Diffusion coefficients for CyArg at higher temperatures in aqueous solution were measured following the previously described procedures.16

Because the non-catalytic wave could be easily measured for both systems in methanol, the following equation using the ratio of the  $i_{cat}/i_{p}$  could be used:<sup>30</sup>

$$\frac{i_{\text{cat}}}{i_{\text{p}}} = \frac{n}{0.4463} \sqrt{\frac{RTk_{\text{obs}}}{F\nu}} \tag{3}$$

where,  $i_{cat}$  = catalytic current,  $i_{p}$  = Ni<sup>I/II</sup> oxidation peak current, n = number of electrons (2 in this case), R = universal gas constant, T = temperature, F = Faraday's constant,  $\nu$  = scan rate. To account for the overlap of the Ni<sup>II/I</sup> and Ni<sup>I/O</sup> couples, the  $i_p$  was divided by two for use in eqn (3).

Because the non-catalytic waves were obscured by H2 production waves in water, we utilized the following equation that requires knowing the diffusion coefficient at a given temperature  $(D_{cat})$ , A (electrode surface area;  $9.23 \times 10^{-3} \text{ cm}^2$ ), [cat] (catalyst concentration), as previously reported: 15,16

$$TOF = \left(\frac{i_{cat}}{nFA[cat]\sqrt{D_{cat}}}\right)^2 \tag{4}$$

where,  $i_{\text{cat}}$  = catalytic current, n (number of electrons; two), F (Faraday's constant). Conditions in which scan rate independence was observed were used for calculations in both in water and methanol.<sup>15</sup>

Open circuit potential measurement. Following a published procedure, <sup>31</sup> a freshly prepared Pt wire was used as the working electrode and the same AgCl-coated Ag wire (in 0.1 M of <sup>n</sup>Bu<sub>4</sub>N<sup>+</sup>BF<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup> in methanol) separated from the analyte solution by a Vycor frit was used as the reference electrode. Open circuit potentials or the equilibrium potentials, were measured under 1 atm H<sub>2</sub> with constant stirring in the following conditions: (i) methanol, (ii) methanol with 1.0 M water, and (iii) methanol with 25 mM HTFSI acid and 1.0 M water. The potential was referenced with the hydroxymethyl ferrocene couple and was also measured in the same conditions using a glassy carbon working electrode along with the same reference and counter electrodes. For high pressure conditions, the OCP was adjusted using the Nernst equation:<sup>30</sup>

$$E_{\text{OCP}}(x \text{ atm } H_2)(\text{mV}) = \left[E_{\text{OCP}}(1 \text{ atm } H_2) - 30 \log \left(\frac{x \text{ atm}}{1 \text{ atm}}\right)\right](\text{mV})$$

Over the temperature range at which we are working, temperature has a negligible effect on the overpotential, as previously demonstrated for **CyArg** which maintained reversibility from 40  $^{\circ}$ C to 72  $^{\circ}$ C. <sup>16</sup>

The  $pK_a$  of any protonated Ni( $P^R_2N^{R'}_2$ )<sub>2</sub> intermediates can be estimated from the knowledge of the Ni(i)/Ni(0) redox potential of the non-protonated species, and the  $pK_a$  of the parent α-aminium  $R'NH_3^+$  in acetonitrile,<sup>32,33</sup> in this case for protonated arginine, using linear free energy relationships. For instance, for the  $pK_a$  of the singly *endo* N-protonated Ni(II) species:

$$pK_{a} = -8.47E^{\circ}(I/0) + 0.9 pK_{a}(R'NH_{3}^{+}) - 17$$
 (6)

Relationships were also developed to determine the  $pK_a$  for other species and were utilized here. While  $pK_a(R'NH_3^+)$  is easily calculated, as described below, obtaining the redox potential for this complex is challenging. The redox potentials cannot be directly measured as the Ni(1)/Ni(0) couple is overlapping the Ni(11)/Ni(11), thought to be due to a concerted chemical step. On the other hand, calculating the redox potentials is difficult because of the size of the complex and the rich conformational space accessible, which introduces large errors. For these reasons, we used an estimate of the redox potential based on Taft-like linear free energy relationships we derived for  $[Ni(P^R_2N^{R'}_2)_2]^{2+}$  in acetonitrile:

$$E^{\circ}(I/0) = 0.337 \sigma^{*}(R) - 0.314 E_{s}(R) - 0.036 p K_{a}(R' N H_{3}^{+}) - 0.904 V$$
(7)

where  $\sigma^*(R)$  and  $E_s(R)$  are the Taft polar and steric substituent constants (for R = Cy,  $\sigma^*(R) = -0.13$  and  $E_s(R) = -0.79$ ). <sup>35</sup> As we will demonstrate in a forthcoming publication, equation S2† yields redox potentials with a mean average error of less than 0.1 V for a large data set of complexes.

The  $pK_a$  values for the pendant amines calculated in acetonitrile where extended to water and methanol using well-established relationships:<sup>20</sup>

$$pK_a(acetonitrile) = 1.22pK_a(H_2O) + 4.90$$
 (8)

$$pK_a(methanol) = 1.02pK_a(H_2O) + 0.73$$
 (9)

The p $K_a$  of the parent aminium in acetonitrile was calculated using Density Functional Theory (DFT) with the hybrid B3P86 exchange and correlation functional  $^{36-38}$  and a  $6-31G^*$  basis set.  $^{39}$  Free energies of solvation in acetonitrile were then computed using the Conductor-like Polarizable Continuum Model (CPCM) $^{40,41}$  with Bondi radii  $^{42}$  defining the solvation cavities. All calculations used the Gaussian09 software package.  $^{43}$  The resulting p $K_a$  for arginine was calculated relative to pyridinium as previously described,  $^{32,33}$  for which an accurate p $K_a$  value in acetonitrile exists. A p $K_a$  = 13.83 for arginine was obtained. The resulting p $K_a$ s calculated for the metal complexes are shown in Table S2.†

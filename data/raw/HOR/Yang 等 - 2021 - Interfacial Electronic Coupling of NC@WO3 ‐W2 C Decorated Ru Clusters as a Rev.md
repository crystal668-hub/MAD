#### **Abstract**

Designing a bifunctional catalyst for hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is significant toward developing sustainable hydrogen-electric conversion systems. Herein, we develop a cost-effective bifunctional catalyst of Ru/N-doped Carbon@WO3-W2C (Ru/NC@WOC) via co-precipitation and polyol reduction. Ru/NC@WOC shows superior HOR/HER activity in alkaline solution in comparison with commercial Pt/C. HOR electrochemical tests show that the mass activity at 0.05 V (1.96 mA gRu −1 ) and exchange-current density are 7.5 and 1.2 times that of Pt/C. Additionality, the Ru/NC@WOC exhibit up 30-fold HOR activity in mass activity compared with benchmark Ru/C. Moreover, it also displays exceptional electrocatalytic HER with overpotential of 31 mV@10 mA cm<sup>2</sup> and 119 mV@100 mA cm<sup>2</sup> , surpassing Pt/C, benchmark Ru/C and most of the previously reported electrocatalysts. The outstanding catalytic activity of Ru/NC@WOC probably arises from the synergy between Ru and NC@WOC matrix, suitable hydrogen binding energy, and highly conductive substrate. Thus, this work may pave a new avenue to fabricate low-cost bifunctional HOR/HER catalysts for alkaline fuel cells and water electrolyzer.

#### **Introduction**

With the severe energy shortage and negative environmental issues due to the rapid depletion of traditional fossil fuels, it is exigent to develop green, renewable, and highlyefficient energy sources. [1] Hydrogen generated through water electrolysis is a practical approach to reduce our excessive reliance on conventional fossil fuels. [2] For the reversible hydrogen electrode reactions, involving hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), in which HOR predominantly finds application on the anode of fuel cells and HER features in water electrolysis. [3] The proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) have gained substantial attentions owing to high power efficiency and high energy density. [1d] However, PEMFCs operate in a strong acidic condition and rely on expensive Ptbased catalysts. [4] As a result; the alkaline anion-exchange membrane fuel cells (AAEMFCs) and water electrolyzers have been regarded as a promising alternative to the PEMFCs-based devices. [5] Subsequently, the rapid development of AAEMFCs has motivated searches for active HOR/HER electro-catalysts in alkaline conditions. In particular, designing reversible catalysts for HOR/HER appears to be critical since it can work in the reversible fuel cell, including hydrogen oxidation in the fuel-cell mode and hydrogen evolution in the water-electrolysis mode to realize the reversible production and utilization of hydrogen.[6] To date, Pt and Pt-based catalysts are the optimal HOR/HER electro-catalysts. But the alkaline HOR/HER activity of Pt is much sluggish, being approximately two to three orders of magnitude less active than that in acid, which means a very high Pt loading is required in alkaline media. [7] Thus, developing highly efficient, cost-effective, and stable HOR/HER catalysts is of immense economic

significance. In order to design new efficient HOR/HER electrocatalysts, fundamentally understanding the HOR/HER reaction mechanisms under an alkaline medium is necessary.

A bifunctional mechanism was reported in the previous work to explain the performance of HOR/HER under alkaline media [8]: (1) The adsorbed OH (oxophilicity) on the metal, (2) The strength of hydrogen binding energy (HBE) on metal, and (3) Maximized electrocatalystoxide interface. On the one hand, Markovic et al. have shown adding oxophillic components (eg. Ru) can enhance the HOR/HER activity compared with monometallic Pt. [8c] Qiu et al. verified that much stronger adsorbed OH on the PdCu's BCC phase reveals the higher HOR mass and specific activities than that of the FCC phase. [9] Nevertheless, the OHads desorption from oxophilic components is more challenging than the Hads desorption through the catalyst's surface, resulting in higher energy barriers of H2Oads desorption. [10] On the other hand, Durst et al. designed new and advanced electrocatalysts with tuned H-binding energies for HOR/HER, pointing to the importance of HBE toward the activity HOR/HER. [11] Yan et al. have also demonstrated that alkaline HOR/HER activities can be related to the HBE, as volcano-shaped curves, illustrating the HBE plays a crucial role toward HOR/HER. [12] Samanta et al. showed that HBE and oxophilic property may be two equal roles for HOR/HER in the alkaline.[4] Meanwhile, Speck et al. demonstrated that maximizing the metal and metal oxide interface is crucial to HOR activity. [8d]

Ruthenium is considered as an alternative to Pt in HOR/HER catalysts owing to the appropriate strength of Ru-H bonds and lower price. [13] A high surface area catalyst's support is of great significance for the heterogeneous catalyst since it creates a high metal-support interface. Transition metal carbides (TMCs) have evoked special attention because of their Pt-

like catalytic properties, good electrical conductivity, and strong oxidation resistance. [14] In various precious metal catalysts, tungsten carbide has been recognized as an essential component or support like Pd3Ni/WC, Pt-WC1-x/MWNT, 5% Pt/WC, *etc*. [15] There have been many attempts to improve the electrocatalytic activity for HOR, methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) by using tungsten carbide. [16] Compared with carbon supports, the electrochemically active surface areas (ECSAs) of noble metal loaded on W2C or WC has increased by 2 to 3 times, thanks to hydrogen spillover, [17] which refers to the migration of activated hydrogen atoms from the noble metal particles to the catalyst support surface. [18] In addition, metal/metal oxides are typical supporters due to their interfacial synergies and strong metal-support interaction. [19] For instance, WO<sup>3</sup> was also used as a carrier for noble metal particles due to hydrogen spillover, [18] enhancing the interaction between active components and supports. The W ions can act as Lewis acid sites to adsorb H2O molecules on WO<sup>3</sup> surface. And the interaction between adsorbed H2O and W is not strong enough to hold H2O on the surface, as demonstrated by detailed density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which may benefit water dissociation. [20]

Accordingly, we reported a bifunctional Ru/NC@WO3-W2C (Ru/NC@WOC) catalyst that can be used for HOR and HER electrocatalyst. In other words, we attempt to design a system that couples HOR with HER to realize the mutual conversion of electricity and hydrogen energy. A series of different loadings of Ru clusters with an average size of 1.79 nm evenly distributed on NC@WOC are synthesized by polyol reduction and characterized the HOR/HER activity in alkaline media. The HOR/HER activity strongly depend on phase governed by calcination temperature. The NC@WOC support annealed at 700 C decorated with Ru clusters

exhibits remarkable catalytic performances of alkaline HOR/HER in two separate system. Additionally, it also displays long-term durability. This new attractive strategy of utilizing Ru clusters, WO<sup>3</sup> and W2C to tune the electronic structures and enhance the interfacial interaction between metal and support may provide a possibility for the rational design of HOR/HER electrocatalysts.

#### **Results and Discussion**

#### **Synthetic strategy analysis**

Primarily, WO3nH2O nanosheets were synthesized by NaWO<sup>4</sup> and HCl solution coprecipitation method. The resulting precipitates were grounded with dicyandiamide (nitrogen sources) and calcined in the Ar atmosphere at 700 °C. Thus, the WO<sup>3</sup> and W2C species were conformally wrapped by N-doped C (NC), NC can effectively inhibit the aggregation of Ru clusters during polyol process to form small-sized Ru clusters. [21] Finally, Ru was deposited on NC@WO3-W2C (Ru/NC@WOC) by polyol reduction method, in which RuCl3·*x*H2O was used as metallic Ru precursor, ethylene glycol as solvent as well as the reductant for the complete reduction of Ru3+ to Ru<sup>0</sup> , and PVP as a structure-directing agent. For comparison, samples of Ru/NC@WO3-600 °C, Ru/NC@W2C-800 °C, Ru/NC@W2C-900 °C were also synthesized by the same route as Ru/NC@WOC. As displayed in Table S1, Ru species' content was analyzed by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES). The majority of characterizations and discussions are on the optimal sample containing 6.3 wt% Ru (abbreviated as Ru/NC@WOC).

#### **Crystal structures and microstructure analysis**

The phase composition of the catalysts was firstly elucidated by X-ray diffraction (XRD). As seen in Figure S2a, the diffraction peaks at ~25° corresponded to amorphous C, where the characteristic diffraction peaks at 42.2, 43.4, 57.9, and 68.1° were indexed to the (002), (101), (102) and (110) reflections of hexagonal close-packed (hcp) metallic Ru (JCPDS: 88-1734). The diffraction peaks at 38.0, 39.6, and 61.9° are assigned to (002), (101), and (110) of hexagonal W2C (JCPDS: 35-0776). Notably, no diffraction peak of WO<sup>3</sup> was observed in the nanohybrid materials, demonstrating the amorphous form of WO3. [22] Figure S2c shows the samples' XRD patterns after heat treatment of the precursors at 600 °C to 900 °C. First, the WO<sup>3</sup> crystal phases were detected after 600 °C, and then W2C phases started to appear at 700 °C. Interestingly, the XRD signals of WO<sup>3</sup> were disappeared after 800 °C (Figure S2).

N-containing species not only can promote the anchoring of metal NPs onto a substrate but also greatly enhance the affinity of metal precursor to support through electrostatic interactions to achieve the high catalytic activity. [23] During the calcination, in-situ doping of nitrogen plays a "high-ways" role in promoting the metal ions transport conducting uniform dispersion of Ru clusters. [24] We observed the morphology of the catalysts using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As expected, Ru clusters with an average size of ~1.79 nm evenly distribute on NC@WOC matrix without agglomeration (Figure 1a). And the contents of N elements were examined by elemental analyzer shown in Table S2. A high-resolution TEM (HR-TEM) image (Figure 1b) shows the well-resolved lattice fringes with 0.21 nm, associated with the Ru (101) plane, where the lattice fringes with inter-planar spacing of 0.23 and 0.26 nm, consistent with distances of W2C (101) and (100) planes. Furthermore, the HAADF-STEM image and EDS element mapping images are shown in Figure 1d. It revealed that C, N, O, W, Ru elements distribute uniformly in Ru/NC@WOC nanostructures. The morphological features produce Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface areas of 324.07 m<sup>2</sup> g −1 for Ru/NC@WOC. The pore-size distribution examined by the BJH method was 6.4 nm, proving that Ru/NC@WOC is a typical mesoporous material (Figure 1c). [25] There are two predominant Raman peaks at around 1360 and 1560 cm−1 representing D and G bands (Figure S3). [26] The D-band is ascribed to the vibration of disordered and defective graphite, while the G-band is related to graphitic lattice phonon. [27] With the increase of calcination temperature, the graphitization degree of carbon materials is improved. Compared with Ru/NC@W2C-800 C and Ru/NC@W2C-900 C, Ru/NC@WOC has a smaller ID/I<sup>G</sup> value, which probably due to the synergy of defective carbon and graphitized carbon atoms contribute to the formation of highly

conductive materials at the appropriate temperature.<sup>[25, 28]</sup> The  $I_D/I_G$  value of ~0.83 can be observed for the different loading of Ru species, indicating the same degree of graphitization.

#### **XPS** analysis

The valence states and compositions of the sample was obtained by X-ray photoelectron spectrometer. The full survey spectrum of Ru/NC@WOC containing the C, N, O, W, Ru shows in Figure 2a, which is well-aligned with the XRD and TEM results. Eight binding energy (BE) peaks can be deconvoluted in the C 1s + Ru 3d XPS spectrum of Ru/NC@WOC (Figure 2b). The peaks at a BE of 284.0, 284.8, 286.0, and 287.7 eV were readily attributed to C=C, C-C/C-N, C-O, and C=O, which Ru 3d peaks are instead observed at the BEs of 288.0 (Ru $^0$  3d5/2), 283.8 (Ru $^0$  3d3/2), 281.1 (RuO2 3d5/2) and 285.2 eV (RuO2 3d3/2). Two couplets of peaks were observed in the Ru 3p spectrum (Figure 2c). The peaks centered at 461.7 and 483.8 eV are ascribed to the Ru 3p3/2 and Ru 3p1/2. The two smaller peaks at the BE of 464.8 and 486.7 eV

attributable to the RuO<sub>2</sub>  $3p_{3/2}$  and RuO<sub>2</sub>  $3p_{1/2}$  that possibly originated from the air XPS exposure analysis.<sup>[13b]</sup> Four peaks at 31.4, 33.1, 34.7, and 36.9 eV were assigned to W 4f. The relatively weak bands at 31.4 and 33.1 eV were indexed to W-C bonding, while the other two can be assigned to W-O binding energies (Figure 2d).<sup>[30]</sup> As presented in Figure 2e, N 1s XPS spectrum occur four N species at 396.8, 398.8, 399.9, and 401.1 eV, namely W-N, pyridinic-N, pyrrolic-N, and graphitic-N species.<sup>[31]</sup> The O 1s XPS spectrum (Figure 2f) were fitted by three deconvoluted peaks at 530.2 eV (M-O), 531.8 eV (C=O), and 532.7 eV (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>ads</sub>), further demonstrating the existence of WO<sub>3</sub>-W<sub>2</sub>C.<sup>[32]</sup>

#### **Electrochemical activity toward the alkaline HOR**

The pyrolysis temperature is of paramount importance for the catalytic activity of HOR. [33] It is thus essential to optimize the calcination temperature. The HOR polarization curves (Figure 3a) showed that Ru/NC@WOC calcined at 700 °C shows the best performance. And the CVs of these catalysts are displayed in Figure S4. Note that the electrochemical data reported here was the uncompensated ohm drop with *iR*-correction (Figure S5). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopic results revealed that Ru/NC@WOC has relatively lower resistances as compared to Ru/C thereof a faster charge transfer.[34] We further show the Tafel plots of the kinetic current density (*j*k) vs. the overpotential (Figure 3b). The exchange-current density (*j*0) was obtained from the micro-polarization region (-5 to 5 mV) by linear fitting through the Butler–Volmer equation. [35] The slope is directly proportional to *j*<sup>0</sup> (Figure S6). As displayed in Figure 3c, the Ru/NC@WOC shows *j*<sup>0</sup> of 2.4 mA cm<sup>2</sup> , which is higher than Ru/NC@WO3-600 °C (0.23 mA cm<sup>2</sup> ), Ru/NC@W2C-800 °C (2.1 mA cm<sup>2</sup> ), and Ru/NC@W2C-900 °C (1.6 mA cm<sup>2</sup> ). We also calculated the *j*<sup>k</sup> normalized with the precious metal loading at 0.05 V (vs. RHE) (Figure 3c). It appears that the sequence of mass activity is: Ru/NC@WOC (1.96 mA gRu −1 ) > Ru/NC@W2C-800 °C (0.31 mA gRu −1 ) > Ru/NC@W2C-900 °C (0.16 mA gRu −1 ) > Ru/NC@WO3-600 °C (0.0093 mA gRu −1 ), further verifying the pyrolysis temperature of the support is a crucial factor to HOR catalysis. Meanwhile, the Ru loading was also optimized. As shown in Figure 3d, we found that a higher Ru loading indicated a higher HOR current density, in which the exchange current density of Ru/NC@WOC (2.4 mA cm<sup>2</sup> ) increases 1.5 times compared to that of Ru4.4/NC@WOC (1.6 mA cm<sup>2</sup> ). Still, the increment is only 1.13 times when the Ru content increases from 6.3 to 9.1 wt% (2.7 mA cm<sup>2</sup> ). Figure 3e shows the Tafel plots of these three

samples. Simultaneously, the mass activity is calculated to be 1.84, 1.96, and 0.21 mA  $\mu g_{Ru}^{-1}$  for Ru<sub>9.1</sub>/NC@WOC, Ru/NC@WOC, and Ru<sub>4.4</sub>/NC@WOC (Figure 3f).

It is generally accepted that HBE is closely related to HOR/HER activity. [8b] The complete desorption-potential of H on the electrocatalyst representing the H binding strength and faster HOR kinetics is benefited from the sites with weaker HBE in alkaline media. [36] Next, we studied the electrocatalytic HOR performance of Ru/NC@WOC, NC@WOC, commercial Pt/C catalysts and benchmark Ru/C. CVs of these three catalysts in N2-saturated 0.1 M KOH electrolyte are indicated in Figure 4a. Ru/NC@WOC and commercial Pt/C exhibited the typical characteristic peaks of hydrogen adsorption/desorption in 0 V and 0.4 V (vs. RHE) range. The EH-desorption negatively shifts from commercial Pt/C (0.311 V vs. RHE) to Ru/NC@WOC (0.227 V vs. RHE), indicating reduced HBE. [36-37] However, the NC@WOC and benchmark Ru/C showed unremarkable hydrogen adsorption/desorption peak, demonstrating the importance of interaction between metal and supports. [38] Thus, we can conclude that the Ru/NC@WOC with weaker HBE possesses higher HOR kinetics superior to commercial Pt/C. The HOR

polarization curves (Figure 4b) displayed that the anode current density of Ru/NC@WOC is higher than commercial Pt/C and benchmark Ru/C across the whole potential range. Ru/NC@WOC performed a better HOR activity than Ru/C at the same Ru loading, substantiating the significance of well-dispersed Ru clusters supported on the NC@WOC matrix in promoting hydrogen oxidation. The *j<sup>0</sup>* is evaluated from the micro-polarization linear region (-5 mV to 5mV), Ru/NC@WOC shows higher slope than Pt/C and Ru/C, suggesting the higher HOR activity (Figure S6c). Simultaneously, the NC@WOC has negligible impact on HOR activity; therefore, the Ru was considered the active component of Ru/NC@WOC. Figure S7 showed Ru/NC@WOC's polarization curves in N2-saturated 0.1 M KOH; only a small anode current was observed, indicating the H<sup>2</sup> is a reactant for HOR. We investigated Ru/NC@WOC's polarization curves as a function of rotating speeds (Figure S8). The current density grows with the increase of rotational rate due to mass transport promotion at higher rotating speed. [35] Inset showed the Koutecky-Levich plot of Ru/NC@WOC at an overpotential of 25 mV, which exhibited the inverse of *j* is in direct proportion to 1/2. The HOR/HER Tafel plots of the *j*<sup>k</sup> on Ru/NC@WOC, NC@WOC, commercial Pt/C and benchmark Ru/C are shown in Figure 4c. The accelerated durability tests (ADTs) were conducted in 0.1 M KOH under continuous N<sup>2</sup> flow by cycling the potential from 0 to 1.0 V (vs. RHE) at 100 mV s<sup>1</sup> for 1000 cycles. Alkaline HOR polarization curves of Ru/NC@WOC before and after 1000 CV cycles are displayed in Figure 4d. The polarization curves almost overlap, demonstrating the favorable stability of Ru/NC@WOC. Besides, the durability of Ru/NC@WOC and commercial Pt/C were assessed by chronoamperometry at low potential = 0.05 V (vs. RHE) and high potential = 0.15 V (vs. RHE) in H2-satuared 0.1 M KOH while rotating them at 1600 rpm (Figure S9).

Ru/NC@WOC maintained a stable current density of ~2.6 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> and ~3.7 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> throughout the test that contrasted by the gradual activity loss of commercial Pt/C. At 0.05 V (vs. RHE),  $j_k$  of 63.07 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> was obtained for Ru/NC@WOC, which is 4.7 times as high as that of Pt/C benchmark. Moreover, it exhibited up 30-fold HOR improvement in j<sub>k</sub> compared with benchmark Ru/C. The Ru/NC@WOC shows  $j_0$  of 2.4 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, which exceeds that of 2.0 and 1.0 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> for commercial Pt/C and benchmark Ru/C (Figure 4e). As illustrated in Figure 4f and Table S3, Ru/NC@WOC shows much better HOR performance compared with Pt/C benchmark and other reported HOR electrocatalysts. Moreover, we summarized the metal loading, ECSA,  $j_{k,m}$ @50 mV, SA@50 mV,  $j_k$ @50 mV and  $j_0$  in Table 1. As Ru would block the sites for desorption and adsorption of hydrogen, it is not suitable to use H-UPD region to calculate the ECSAs. [39] The ECSAs of samples were measured via CO stripping voltammetry. As presented in Figure 5a-c and Figure S10, the ECSAs of Ru/NC@WOC was calculated to be 161.5 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>, which is 3.3 times higher than Pt/C benchmark (48.1 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>) and 10 times higher than Ru/C benchmark (15.8 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>). The ECSAs of other catalysts were summarized in Table 1.

#### Electrochemical activity toward the alkaline HER

HER is the reverse reaction of HOR. The HER tests were performed in H<sub>2</sub>-saturated 1.0 M KOH electrolyte. During the measurement, high-purity H<sub>2</sub> is bubbled through the electrolyte to saturated it, fix the reversible hydrogen potential, and prevent the dissolution and absorption of CO<sub>2</sub>. [40] Initially, as-prepared catalysts' HER performance was optimized by varying the annealing temperature of support from 600 °C to 900 °C at the same metal loading. The results indicated that catalyst activity with support at an annealing temperature of 700 °C stays on the top among them and possesses the smallest Tafel slope (Figure S11). Similarly, we also explore the effect of Ru loading on catalytic performances. LSV curves manifested that the catalyst with a Ru loading of 6.3 wt% shows the lowest potential at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> (Figure S11). Meanwhile, we performed a comparative study of the HER activities of Ru/NC@WOC, NC@WOC, commercial Pt/C and Ru/C benchmark.

**Figure 6.** (a) HER polarization curves, (b) Tafel slopes, (c) Complex-plane plot and (d) The TOF profiles versus potentials of Ru/NC@WOC, NC@WOC, Pt/C and benchmark Ru/C. (e) Comparison with the overpotentials of Ru/NC@WOC, Pt/C and benchmark Ru/C at 10, 50 and 100 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. (f) Comparison with the overpotential@10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> of previously reported

catalysts.

Figure 6a shows the polarization curves of these four catalysts. The Ru/NC@WOC displayed a similar HER performance with lower overpotential of 31 mV to yield 10 mA cm<sup>2</sup> compared with commercial Pt/C (32 mV) and benchmark Ru/C (64 mV). The NC@WOC is inert for HER catalysis. Moreover, we summarized the corresponding overpotential at different current densities (Figure 6e). Over potentials of Ru/NC@WOC at various current densities (31 mV@10 mA cm<sup>2</sup> , 88 mV@50 mA cm<sup>2</sup> , and 119 mV@100 mA cm<sup>2</sup> ) are significantly lower than those of the commercial Pt/C (32 mV@10 mA cm<sup>2</sup> , 111 mV@50 mA cm<sup>2</sup> , and 194 mV@100 mA cm<sup>2</sup> ) and the Ru/C benchmark (64 mV@10 mA cm<sup>2</sup> , 147 mV@50 mA cm<sup>2</sup> , and 206 mV@100 mA cm<sup>2</sup> ). The corresponding Tafel slopes are 40.5, 40.7, 63.2 and 186.6 mV dec−1 for Ru/NC@WOC, commercial Pt/C, benchmark Ru/C and NC@WOC (Figure 6b). It is shown that the highly efficient HER kinetics on the Ru/NC@WOC follows the Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism associated with the electrochemical desorption of hydrogen, which is the rate-limiting step. [34] The solution resistance reflects the impedance between the working electrode and the reference electrode circuit, which is mainly affected by changes in the experimental setup (Figure S12), while the charge transfer resistance mainly explores the conductivity of the catalyst. As illustrated in Figure 6c, Ru/NC@WOC shows a much smaller semi-circle than that of commercial Pt/C and the Ru/C benchmark in complex-plane plot, demonstrating Ru/NC@WOC has a smaller charge transfer resistance with higher conductivity during the HER catalysis. [41] Ru/NC@WOC's stability was observed with LSV after cycling 1000 CVs at a sweep rate of 100 mV s<sup>1</sup> between 0 - 1.0 V (vs. RHE) (Figure S13). Then, the overpotential of Ru/NC@WOC at 10 mA cm<sup>2</sup> increased by 13 mV after 1000 cycles,

suggesting Ru/NC@WOC's good stability. Additionally, we also evaluated the durability of Ru/NC@WOC and the commercial Pt/C by chronopotentiometry. A negligible decline was observed from Ru/NC@WOC during the test, indicating comparable durability to that of commercial Pt/C catalysts (Figure S14). The turnover frequency (TOF) value was calculated using ICP results (see Table S1) to assess per-site instinct activity quantitatively. [42] The TOF value of commercial Pt/C and the Ru/C benchmark is only 0.014 s<sup>1</sup> and 0.012 s<sup>1</sup> at an overpotential of 100 mV. In comparison, Ru/NC@WOC's TOF value is 0.033 s<sup>1</sup> , obviously demonstrating the HER catalytic performance of Ru/NC@WOC surpass that of the Pt/C benchmark and the Ru/C benchmark (Figure 6d). Furthermore, Ru/NC@WOC's HER activity exhibits much lower overpotential than that of Ru-based electro-catalysts reported in recent years (Figure 6f and Table S4).

#### **Catalytic mechanism analysis toward the alkaline HER/HOR**

The combination of metal Ru and n-type WO<sup>3</sup> semiconductor could generate a heterogeneous interface. Since the work function of Ru metal (FM = 4.7 eV) is smaller than the Fermi level of n-type WO<sup>3</sup> semiconductor (FS = 5.05 eV), part of electrons would be transferred from metallic Ru to WO<sup>3</sup> to form electron-deficient Ru and electron-rich n-type WO3. [43] DFT calculations by Jiang et al. have shown that GH\* (-0.44 eV) of Ru2P/WO3@NPC is close to 0 than that of WO3@NPC (-0.82 eV), indicating the Ru sites can be favorable for the adsorption and desorption of Hydrogen. [22] Albanese et al. have demonstrated that W sites on WO<sup>3</sup> facilitate the adsorption H2O and the interaction of H2Oads and W is not very strong, which is beneficial to H2Oads dissociation. [20] For HER mechanism, we can conclude the positivecharged Ru sites and negative-charged WO<sup>3</sup> facilitate dissociative of H2Oads from WO<sup>3</sup> and

accelerate the adsorption and desorption of hydrogen from Ru sites to form H<sup>2</sup> in alkaline media. Besides, the role of W2C is not negligible, which provides high electrical conductivity. As the OH adsorption on the metal surface is widely accepted as the rate-determining step of HOR activity in alkaline, we performed CO stripping experiments to investigate OH adsorption on the Ru sites. [7c] The Ru/NC@WOC and Ru/NC@W2C-900 °C of CO stripping voltammetry curves are displayed in Figure 5 and Figure S9, Ru/NC@WOC shows a CO stripping peak potential of 0.80 V. In contrast, Ru/NC@W2C-900 °C shows a peak at 0.74 V, revealing WO<sup>3</sup> mainly regulated the adsorption of OH. That is, WO<sup>3</sup> provides OH adsorption sites, Ru serves as active sites for H adsorption. Hads desorption on Ru sites increases the reactivity of OHads desorption to form H2O.

Based on the above results, the encouraging HOR/HER performance in alkaline electrolyte could be arisen from the following aspects: 1) The strong electronic interaction between Ru and NC@WOC substrate. 2) Ru possesses the appropriate strength of HBE. 3) W2C acts as a highly conductive component of the support, beneficial to electrons transfer during the electrocatalysis. 4) N dopants can restrain the aggregation of Ru clusters and make the Ru clusters uniformly distribute on the NC@WOC matrix with average sizes within 2 nm, which ensures the utilization of metal Ru, resulting in numerous exposed active sites.

#### **Conclusions**

In summary, a cost-effective bifunctional catalyst of Ru/NC@WO3-W2C is fabricated via co-precipitation and polyol reduction methods. The calcination temperature of the support performs a fundamental role in the electrocatalytic activity of HOR/HER. During annealing from 600 °C to 900 °C, a phase transformation was observed between WO<sup>3</sup> and W2C. The

Ru/NC@WOC sample, featuring WO<sup>3</sup> phase and W2C phase, exhibits higher mass activity and exchange-current density of HOR than commercial Pt/C in alkaline media. Moreover, Ru/NC@WOC shows an outstanding electrocatalytic H<sup>2</sup> production capacity with overpotentials of 31 and 119 mV at 10 and 100 mA cm<sup>2</sup> in alkaline media. The high HOR/HER activities can be ascribed to the synergy between the three components, namely Ru, WO3, and W2C. Systematic investigations further demonstrated that WO<sup>3</sup> offers OH adsorption sites and Ru provides adsorption sites for H, endowing Ru/NC@WOC with outstanding HOR activity. For the enhancement of HER activity, the electron donation from Ru to W promotes the dissociation of H2O and desorption of Hads, release H<sup>2</sup> gas. Our work provides a rational strategy for developing a low-cost and stable bifunctional-electrocatalyst as an alternative to Pt/C for fuel cells and water electrolyzers.

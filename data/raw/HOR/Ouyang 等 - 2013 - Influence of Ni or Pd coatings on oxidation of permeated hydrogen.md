The influence of Pd and Ni coatings on the oxidisation of hydrogen that permeated through a thin iron membrane was studied for the development of a hydrogen sensor. The minimum electroplating period and current density to produce compact Ni and Pd coatings were investigated. The ideal potential ranges for complete oxidation of the hydrogen that permeated through an iron membrane were found to be +0.20 to +0.50 V(Ni) (voltage versus the voltage on nickel wire) and +0.30 to +0.40 V(Ni) for the Pd and Ni coatings respectively; the Pd coating provides a wider window for oxidation. The optimum potential for the oxidation of hydrogen on Ni coating was found to be 0.35 V(Ni). Ni coating could achieve the same detection efficiency as a Pd coating with the appropriate applied potential.

#### Introduction

The absorption, diffusion and permeation of hydrogen in metals occur in many electrochemical processes and applications, such as corrosion, fuel cells and electroplating. The introduction of hydrogen atoms into a metal can lead to hydrogen embrittlement and can also enhance the susceptibility of an alloy to stress corrosion cracking. These two processes can lead to potential safety issues and potential economic losses caused by premature or unanticipated material failure. The diffusion behaviour of hydrogen in metals has been widely studied, especially in steel alloys. 1-3 Owing to the presence of free interstitial sites in steel alloys, hydrogen atoms can diffuse readily. If they accumulate to sufficient concentrations, the hydrogen atoms can cause the formation of metal hydrides, and this leads to embrittlement of the alloy.4 In addition, the explosive failure of a steel vessel containing an acidic solution has been attributed to the diffusion of atomic hydrogen into the steel and accumulation at dislocations, grain boundaries and voids to form high pressure molecular hydrogen.5

Owing to the safety issues, online detection of the hydrogen content in steel components has been the subject of much attention. Several types of sensors (e.g. pressure, <sup>6–8</sup> vacuum<sup>9,10</sup> and electrochemical <sup>11–13</sup>) have been developed to monitor the amount of hydrogen that enters into a steel alloy. Electrochemical sensors have

The 'double cell' technique was developed by Devanathan and Stachurski (DS) in 1962<sup>14</sup> to study hydrogen diffusion in metals, and it has been widely used since then. Many researchers have developed improved electrochemical hydrogen sensors based on the DS cell design. <sup>15–20</sup> In addition, a number of different sensors for the detection of hydrogen have been demonstrated based on sensitive coatings on steel using palladium, <sup>21–23</sup> platinum, <sup>24</sup> polyaniline <sup>25,26</sup> or nickel, <sup>27</sup> as well as combinations of these materials. <sup>28–30</sup> These sensors are based on detection of the oxidation of hydrogen that has permeated through the steel to reach the exterior surface of the coating.

The developers of the sensitive coatings have not investigated in detail the mechanisms and effectiveness of the catalytic oxidation of hydrogen on Pd or Ni coatings. The dependence of the electrochemical coating parameters and the compactness of a Pd or Ni coating on their catalytic activity to oxidise the permeated hydrogen is the subject of this paper. The conditions used for plating Pd and Ni for oxidation of permeated hydrogen are different from those that are commonly used for general decorative or protective plating, 31-34 although both sets processes use similar plating solutions. A comparison of the effectiveness of Pd and Ni coatings for the oxidation of hydrogen has not previously been reported. In this paper, the oxidation of hydrogen on Pd and Ni coatings that were electroplated onto an iron substrate is investigated in detail. The range of electrochemical potentials required for the oxidation of hydrogen on Pd and Ni coating was explored, and the influence of plating thickness was

received increasing attention due to the advantages that they offer, including a fast response time, high sensitivity, a strong signal and instantaneous detection of penetration through a piece of steel.

examined. The electrochemical behaviour of Ni and Pd and the catalytic mechanism for the oxidation of hydrogen on Ni and Pd is also discussed. The results provide an important theoretical basis and engineering parameters for the development of an inexpensive hydrogen sensor.

### **Experimental**

#### Iron membranes

The iron membranes through which hydrogen was diffused were cut from commercial  $\alpha$  iron sheets, 0.40 mm thick. The chemical composition of the  $\alpha$  iron is Fe–0.012C–0.60Mn–0.05S–0.05P (wt-%). The membrane specimens were  $150\times150$  mm.

# Electroplating process and characterisation of coating surface

Before electroplating the membrane specimens were mechanically ground with Carbimet (SiC) grinding paper (1200 grit), cleaned with an alkaline solution (50 g dm<sup>-3</sup> Na<sub>0</sub>H+10 g dm<sup>-3</sup> Na<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>.12H<sub>2</sub>O), cleaned with an HCl solution (90 g dm<sup>-3</sup>) to remove rust and then rinse with distilled water. Following this preparation, the membranes were electroplated with either Pd or Ni by suspending a membrane in an appropriate solution and applying the electroplating current shown in Table 1. After plating, the membranes were rinsed with distilled water and air dried. The thickness of the Ni or Pd coating

that was applied was controlled by the plating time. The morphology of a coated membrane was characterised by scanning electronic microscopy (JSM-6490).

#### Hydrogen permeation detection method

A double electrolyte cell of the type developed by Devanathan and Stachurski was used in this work. The structural of our DS cell is shown in Fig. 1. The cathodic compartment in the DS cell was filled with a  $0.2 \text{ mol dm}^{-3}$  NaOH and 1% Na<sub>2</sub>S solution and galvanostatically polarised at a constant current density  $(0.4 \text{ mA cm}^{-2})$ . The anodic compartment of the cell contained a  $0.2 \text{ mol dm}^{-3}$  KOH solution and was potentiostatically maintained at a given potential (measured against a nickel reference electrode<sup>36</sup>). All the experiments were carried out at  $18\pm1^{\circ}\text{C}$ . Polarisation curves were measured using a computer controlled electrochemical work station (CHI660B, Shanghai Chen Hua instruments Co., Ltd).

#### Results and discussion

## Iron membrane pretreatment and current behaviour

#### Membrane base current

Before the introduction of hydrogen into the DS cell, the 'base' anodic current that could be passed through the membrane was measured. We call this the 'base' current to distinguish it from the current that we measured for oxidation of hydrogen that permeates through the coated membrane, the 'permeation' current. Figure 2 shows the dependence of the base current on time for an uncoated iron membrane and for membranes coated with Pd (8 min of plating) and Ni (5 min of plating). The applied potential on the cathodic electrode was

3 Dependence of base current densities of Pd and Ni coatings on plating time

+0.2 V(Ni). In all cases, the current started at a high value and then decreased rapidly to a steady state level (after  $\sim\!4$  h for iron and  $\sim\!0.5$  h for the plated membranes). The steady state base current for iron (1.32  $\mu A$  cm $^{-2}$ ) was higher than the base currents for Pd or Ni coatings ( $\sim\!0.15~\mu A$  cm $^{-2}$ ).

There are two possible reasons for the differences in the base currents of the coated and uncoated membranes (as also discussed by Ke et al. 37). One possibility is the oxidation of impurities in electrolyte. We attempted to eliminate this possibility by purifying the electrolyte before current measurement. The freshly prepared electrolyte was poured into a 500 mL beaker and two equal area nickel sheets were put into the solution. These acted as an auxiliary electrode and a working electrode (a pure nickel wire was used as reference electrode). A +0.2 V(Ni) oxidising potential was applied to the working electrode for 48 h by which time the current had decreased to  $<0.2 \mu A \text{ cm}^{-2}$ . Purified electrolyte was used for all further tests. The second possible reason is the passivation of the iron membrane oxidation by the Pd and Ni coatings. Oxidation of Ni or Pd, if it occurred, would tend to lower the base current, while oxidation of iron tends to raise the base current. However, at the applied potential used, there was no oxidation of either Ni or Pd possible, and the base current is due only to iron substrate oxidation. The presence of a protective, non-reactive coating of Pd or

Ni lowers this current by reducing the rate of charge and anion migration through the coating layer to the iron substrate. Only when the base current had decreased to  $<\!0.5~\mu A~cm^{-2}$  was the measurement of the permeated hydrogen carried out.

#### Base currents with Pd and Ni coatings

The base current depends on the compactness (integrity) and thickness of the Pd and Ni coatings. Compact, non-porous coatings decrease the base current associated with oxidation of the iron substrate, while a less protective coating will support a higher current. Obviously poor coatings are undesirable because they will lead to a high background 'base' current, and this will decrease the sensitivity of a hydrogen sensor that is based on measurement of the hydrogen oxidation permeation current.

The dependence of the base current density on the electroplating period is shown in Fig. 3 for Pd plating at  $0.333~{\rm A~dm^{-2}}$  and Ni plating at  $1.00~{\rm A~dm^{-2}}$ . The higher plating current leads to the formation of a more protective Ni coating faster. After 3 min of plating, the Ni coated membrane has a base current of  $0.5~{\rm \mu A~cm^{-2}}$ , and this current drops to an approximately constant value of  $\sim 0.16~{\rm \mu A~cm^{-2}}$  after eight or more minutes of plating. After 5 min of plating, the Pd coated membrane also has a base current of  $0.5~{\rm \mu A~cm^{-2}}$ , and this current drops to an approximately constant value of  $0.09~{\rm \mu A~cm^{-2}}$  after eight or more minutes of plating.

Both protective coatings are smooth, uniform and compact. Figure 4A shows the surface morphology of a membrane coated with Pd for 8 min, and Fig. 4B shows the surface morphology of a membrane coated with Ni for 5 min.

#### Anodic oxidation Pd and Ni coatings

Anodic polarisation curves of Pd and Ni coated membranes were obtained in  $0.2 \text{ mol dm}^{-3}$  KOH solution at a scan rate of  $1.0 \text{ mV s}^{-1}$  (Fig. 5). Significant oxidation of nickel is seen at +0.50 V(Ni), while oxidation of Pd occurs at +0.60 V(Ni). To prevent oxidation of the coatings during hydrogen permeation detection, the potential applied to the membrane for the oxidation of hydrogen should be lower than the oxidation potential of the coating metal by at least 0.1 V(Ni). That is to say, the oxidation potentials applied for hydrogen

detection should be less than +0.40 V(Ni) for a Ni coating and less than +0.50 V(Ni) for a Pd coating.

#### Oxidation of H

#### Hydrogen permeation and oxidation curves

Figure 6 shows the current as a function of time after applying the cathodic and anodic potentials to the DS cell. The measured anodic current on the membrane arises from the oxidation of hydrogen that has migrated from the cathodic side of the DS cell to the anodic side through the iron membrane and is therefore labelled as the permeation current. The anodic currents given in Fig. 6 are those measured after subtraction of the base current previously determined for the particular coating. The delay in the increase in current with time indicates the incubation period required for hydrogen to diffuse from the cathodic side of the iron membrane through to the Fe/Pd or Ni coating interface once the potentials have been applied in the DS cell. At longer times, the chemistry in the DS cell reaches a steady state, and this is evidenced by the steady state plateau that is reached in the permeation current after ~20 min for Pd and ~40 min for Ni. The rise in the permeation current also occurs slower for Ni. These features may arise because Ni is a more effective barrier to hydrogen migration than Pd.

The permeation current measured with no coating on the iron membrane is very low compared to the currents measured with Pd or Ni coatings. This is due to the much enhance reaction rate of hydrogen on the Pd or Ni coating. These metals act as very effective catalysts. Figure 6 shows that the catalytic activity of Pd for the oxidation of hydrogen was higher than that of nickel at the same oxidation potential (discussed more later).

#### Optimising Pd and Ni plating

Figure 7 shows the dependence of steady state H permeation current density on plating period. By examining Fig. 3, it can be seen that when the coating thickness reaches the point at which the iron oxidation current is independent of thickness, the hydrogen permeation current also reaches a steady state level. This suggests that past a certain coating thickness, the processes associated with mass or charge transport through the coating are not rate determining, and it is the rate of migration through the iron membrane and the relative

catalytic activities of the coatings that control the final steady state oxidation current on the coating.

#### Potentials applied for H oxidation on various coatings

Figure 8 shows the anodic polarisation curves measured on Pd and Ni coated iron membranes in 0.2 mol dm<sup>-3</sup> KOH solutions after the membranes have reached equilibrium at a steady state hydrogen permeation rate. The anodic scans started from the open potentials on the two different membranes, and scanning was carried out at a rate of 1.0 mV s<sup>-1</sup>. For the Ni coating, the anodic current reached 95% of the cathodic current once the potential had risen to -0.5 V(Ni) and then stayed constant until the potential was greater than +0.50 V(Ni). At this point, the Ni coating began to oxidise, and the current rose rapidly (see also Fig. 5). For the Pd coating, 95% of permeated hydrogen atoms were oxidised at +0.055 V(Ni), and the Pd coating began to oxidise at +0.60 V(Ni). Based on these results, the potential zones that can be used for measurement of H oxidation of H on a Ni coating range from about -0.4 to +0.4 V(Ni) and from about +0.1 to +0.6 V(Ni) for a Pd coating. Table 2 summarises the potentials for hydrogen oxidation on Ni and Pd coatings at a steady hydrogen permeation rate.

The Ni coating provides much wider range of potentials than the Pd coating at which a steady state hydrogen permeation current can be measured. Despite

the differences in the permeation currents measured in a potentiostatic cell at 0·2 V(Ni) (Fig. 7), the results of Fig. 8 suggest that it is possible for a Ni coating to achieve the same effective catalytic activity as a Pd coating by increasing the applied potential on the membrane and coating.

The permeated H was not oxidised completely until the oxidation potential on the Ni and Pd coatings was greater than +0.30 V(Ni). Therefore, the oxidation potential on a Pd coating should be kept between +0.30 and +0.50 V(Ni), and the oxidation potential on a Ni coating should be kept between +0.30 and +0.40 V(Ni). For both coatings, a useful target for a hydrogen sensor would be +0.35+0.05 V(Ni).

# Electrocatalytic mechanism for H oxidation on Pd and Ni coatings

A clean iron surface demonstrates no catalytic activity for the oxidation of hydrogen (Fig. 6). This is because H atoms on a pure iron surface could not be ionised. Iron is easily corroded in a KOH solution at pH>10 to form an adherent film of insoluble Fe(OH)2. The Fe(OH)2 is both insulating, and it slows ion transport through the film. The insulating properties of the Fe(OH)<sub>2</sub> film increase the electric resistance in the oxidation cell. The increased resistance drops the potential at the film/ electrolyte interface to such a low level that oxidation of any hydrogen that can migrate through the film does not occur. A passivating layer of catalytic metal on the iron (such as Ni or Pd) prevents build-up on an insulating Fe(OH)<sub>2</sub> film (thereby keeping the potential on the surface in the range where hydrogen oxidation can occur), and it makes the oxidation very efficient by catalysing the oxidation reaction.

The permeation of hydrogen significantly decreases the open circuit potential (OCP) of Ni and Pd coatings. The OCP of Ni was shifted to a more negative value from about -0.2 to -0.66 V(Ni) and that of Pd was shifted from 0.08 to -0.15 V(Ni). Pd is a more stable coating in KOH solution with a minor change in OCP.

The mechanism of H oxidation on a Ni coating could be explained as the following. Under an applied potential, a thin oxide film composed of Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> and NiOOH is formed on an Ni coating. These two species are in equilibrium in a basic solution as follows

$$Ni(OH)_2 + OH^- \rightleftharpoons NiOOH + H_2O + e^-$$
 (1)

Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> and NiOOH have higher electron and proton conductivity.<sup>38</sup> Meanwhile, NiOOH is a more active catalyst to H oxidation.

Palladium is a stable metal in an alkaline solution at room temperature and will not support an oxide film at the experimental potentials. Palladium has a particular affinity for association with hydrogen atoms owing to the electron configuration of the outer d orbitals of a Pd atom.<sup>39</sup> The percentage of electron density in d orbitals in a ground state Pd atom is 46%. There are more electrons and fewer holes in the d band. The outer electron configuration for Pd is 3d<sup>8</sup>4s<sup>2</sup>. In this configuration, six electrons are used to form Pd-Pd metal bonds and four unbonded electrons lie in higher energy levels. These electrons are available to pair with the electron of an H atom and bond by way of chemical adsorption. The adsorbed H atoms (Hads) can readily lose the electron and react with OH<sup>-</sup>. The formation of Pd-H<sub>ads</sub> effectively reduces the overpotential required for the H atom oxidation

$$Pd + H \rightleftharpoons Pd - H_{ads}$$
 (2)

$$Pd - H_{ads} + OH^{-} \rightleftharpoons H_2O + e^{-}$$
 (3)

#### Conclusion

Effective catalytic coatings on an iron membrane were obtained by electroplating Pd for 8–10 min at  $0.333~{\rm A~dm^{-2}}$  and Ni for over 5 min at  $1.00~{\rm A~dm^{-2}}$ . These coatings supported efficient oxidation of hydrogen that permeated through the iron substrate. Tests were performed to determine the optimum coating process. The optimum ranges of an applied potential for the oxidation of permeated hydrogen were determined to be between +0.20 and  $+0.50~{\rm V(Ni)}$  for a Pd coating and between  $+0.30~{\rm and} +0.40~{\rm V(Ni)}$  for a Ni coating. When the oxidation potential was more than  $+0.3~{\rm V(Ni)}$ , the two different coatings exhibit about the same catalytic activity and a potential of  $+0.35\pm0.05~{\rm V(Ni)}$  was identified as the optimum applied potential for both metals

The results show that an effective sensor for determining the onset of permeation of hydrogen through relatively pure iron can be made based on the measurement of the current arising from oxidation of hydrogen on a Ni or a Pd coating. The results also show that the cheaper Ni coating is practical and could be used as an alternative to more expensive Pd. It is expected that the results obtained here can be extended to other iron and steel alloys.

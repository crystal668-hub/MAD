It is highly desired to design and develop highly efficient electrocatalysts for alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction. Herein, we report the development of ultrafine PtCo alloy nanoparticles decorated one-dimensional Co nanowire grown on Ti mesh (PtCo-Co/TiM). Owing to its favorable composition and structure, the PtCo-Co/TiM can deliver an ultrahigh current density of 46.5 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> at an overpotential of 70 mV in 1.0 M KOH, superior to recently reported Pt-based electrocatalysts. This catalyst also provides excellent long-term electrochemical durability with its catalytic activity being maintained for at least 50 h.

Hydrogen as a clean and sustainable energy carrier is considered as an ideal alternative to meet future global energy demands. 1-3 Alkaline water electrolysis provides a promising strategy to produce hydrogen owing to its suitable safety and high-purity product; 4-7 however, the sluggish kinetics of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline media generally causes high overpotential, poor Tafel slopes, and large energy consumption.<sup>8-10</sup> Tremendous efforts have been devoted to developing high-efficiency electrocatalysts to catalyze the conversion of water to hydrogen. 4,11-13 Although Pt exhibits the highest activity for the HER, the high cost and scarcity of Pt sharply hinders its large-scale applications. Motivated by this challenge, developing low-cost Pt-based electrocatalysts by substantially increasing the activity of Pt and reducing the Pt loading is becoming a significant target towards enabling a hydrogen economy.

Note that the HER activity of Pt-based electrocatalysts in

Herein, we report the development of PtCo nanoparticles (NPs) decorated Co nanowire array on Ti mesh (PtCo–Co/TiM) via hydrothermal method and hydrogen reduction. The ultrafine PtCo NPs and synergistic effects between PtCo and Co greatly promote the HER activity in alkaline media. Specially, the PtCo–Co/TiM yields high activity with an overpotential of 70 mV to deliver a current density of 46.5 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, which is 1.8 times higher than that of commercial Pt/C, superior to recently reported electrocatalysts in 1.0 M KOH. Moreover, the PtCo–Co/TiM also exhibits excellent electrochemical durability with limited activity decay after a long-term chronopotentiometry run. The superb HER performance is

alkaline media is much lower than that in acidic media, 14,15 owing to the low efficience of Pt in splitting water into reactive hydrogen intermediates under alkaline media. 16,17 To solve this modifying surface structure of Pt-based electrocatalysts is a promising strategy to significantly enhance their catalytic performance. Owing to intrinsic difference in the chemical activity of metallic components, constructing Ptbased bimetallic alloys has been demonstrated a promising method to develop high-efficiency and low-Pt electrocatalysts by tailoring the material components and electronic structure. <sup>18–22</sup> It has been demonstrated that Pt–Co alloy can effectively reduce the overpotential and improve the sluggish kinetics of electrocatalytic oxygen reduction and hydrogen evolution (HER). 17,18 Moreover, transition metal based catalysts are effective for cleaving the HO-H bond, which can combine with Pt catalysts by creating new synergistic effect to promote alkaline HER performance.<sup>4,5,23</sup> Nevertheless, these electrocatalysts must be adhered on electrode surfaces using a polymer binder, which inevitably increases the series resistance, blocks active sites and suppresses the permeability of gas, thus reducing the catalytic efficiency. Nanoarray catalysts can promote the HER in a more direct manner due to its stronger stability, lower series resistance, more exposed active sites and easier diffusion of the reactants and products.<sup>24-26</sup> Thus we expect that arrayed construction of PtCo alloy with Co supports is a promising strategy towards more efficient and durable HER electrolysis.

mainly relative to the interface formation of novel PtCo-Co heterostructures.

Hydrothermal reaction was used to synthesize PtO2 NPs decorated Co(CO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>0.5</sub>(OH)·0.11H<sub>2</sub>O nanowire array (CCH) supported on TiM (PtO2-CCH/TiM), which was then reduced by hydrogen reduction to obtain PtCo-Co/TiM. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) peaks of CCH powder scratched down from TiM match well with the orthorhombic CCH crystal (JCPDS No. 48-0083), shown in Fig. S1. It is found that the PtO<sub>2</sub>-CCH also possesses the diffraction peaks of CCH structur, indicating no crystal structure change of CCH after hydrothermal treatment with Pt precursor. Meantime, very weak diffraction peaks of orthorhombic PtO<sub>2</sub> phase (JCPDS No. 23-1306) are observed in the XRD pattern of PtO<sub>2</sub>–CCH, owing to ultralow content of the PtO<sub>2</sub>, which is derived from the anion exchange and in-situ formation of PtO<sub>2</sub>. <sup>27,28</sup> After the hydrogen reduction, the peaks of CCH and PtO<sub>2</sub> phases disappear accompanying the formation of a symmetrical peak, which is well indexed to the face-centered cubic Co phase (JCPDS No. 15-0806) and alloyed tetragonal PtCo (JCPDS No. 29-0498) shown in Fig. 1a. The inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) data displays the Co:Pt weight ratio of approximately 14.6:1, indicating a tiny fraction of Pt (6.4 wt%) within PtCo-Co nanowire array.

The morphology of as-made products was investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Fig. 1b shows SEM images of the CCH/TiM, where CCH nanowires with  $^{\sim}3~\mu m$  in length and ~100 nm in diameter are uniformly covered on the entire surface of TiM. After hydrothermal reaction with Pt precursor, the PtO2-CCH/TiM preserves initial nanowire array structure (Fig. S2), indicating robustness characteristic of CCH/TiM. After hydrogen reduction, the PtCo-Co/TiM still nicely maintains one-dimensional array morphology with the formation of rough surfaces (Fig. 1c), indicating that hydrogen reduction cannot destroy the nanowire array structure and meantime provides more surface areas for the HER. The highresolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) image of CCH indicates 5.06 Å spacing of lattice fringes corresponding to d-spacing values of orthorhombic CCH structure in (020) plane (Fig. S3). For PtO<sub>2</sub>-CCH, ultrafine NPs with the size of ~2.3 nm are uniformly decorated on the surface of CCH, which possess 2.25 Å spacing of lattice fringes corresponding to d-spacing values of tetragonal PtO<sub>2</sub> in (200) plane (Fig. S4). After reduction. abundant spatially nanoparticles are homogeneously decorated on the surface of Co nanowire illustrated by TEM image (Fig. 1d). The size of the nanoparticles is in the range of 3-4 nm (Fig. S5) and the lattice spacings of 2.68 and 2.04 Å are corresponding with the dspacing values of tetragonal PtCo crystal in (100) plane and cubic Co crystal in (111) plane, respectively, as shown in Fig. 1e. Moreover, an intimate contact between PtCo and Co is visible on the HRTEM image, which is associated with the interface formation between the PtCo NPs and the Co nanowire, indicative of strong synergetic effect. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) elemental mapping images verify the uniform distribution of Pt and Co elements within the materials (Fig. S6). Therefore, all the above characterization results strongly support the transformation of the PtO2-CCH/TiM into PtCo-Co/TiM by the hydrogen reduction process.

The bonding configuration of Pt was investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) technology, as shown in Fig. 1f. The high-resolution Pt 4f spectrum is deconvoluted into two peaks with binding energies of 71.6 and 75.0 eV, which are corresponding with the spin-orbit split doublet of Pt 4f<sub>7/2</sub> and  $4f_{5/2}$  presented in the zero-valence metallic state, respectively. Notably, the Pt 4f<sub>7/2</sub> peak has a positive shift of approximately 0.4 eV with respect to that of pure Pt (71.2 eV).<sup>29</sup> It is known that the binding energy is strongly correlated with the adsorption/desorption capability of reaction species on the catalyst surface. Moreover, the upshift of binding energy indicates the effect of Co on the electronic structure of Pt. The total number of electrons in one Pt atom increases after alloying Pt with one 3d transition metal, while the number in 5d orbitals decreases because of the vacant d orbitals of the alloying metal. This suggests strong electronic effect between Pt and Co,<sup>29,30</sup> resulting in optimzed adsorption energy of reaction intermediates on the surface of the catalyst. The high-resolution Co 2p spectrum of PtCo-Co/TiM sample is shown in Fig. S7. We can see that Co has both metallic and oxidized states, while the oxidized state is mainly attributed to the surface oxidation exposed in air, which play a significant role in water dissociation. In this way, we expect that PtCo-Co/TiM can greatly enhance the catalytic HER activity.

The HER performance of electrocatalysts was measured using a typical three-electrode setup in 1.0 M KOH. The HER activity of PtCo-Co/TiM was investigated by linear sweep

2a. For comparison, bare TiM,  $PtO_2$ –CCH/TiM and commercial Pt/C (20 wt%) on TiM were also measured. As expected, TiM is inactive toward catalytic HER and the commercial Pt/C exhibits high HER activity. All experimental data were corrected with ohmic potential drop (iR) losses arising from solution resistance and potentials were reported on a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale except specifically explained.<sup>31,32</sup> The LSV curve of the PtCo–Co/TiM electrocatalyst exhibits a near-zero onset overpotential and a strikingly increased current density corresponding to hydrogen evolution. In contrast, the current density of the PtO2-CCH/TiM only shows a moderate increase, although its onset potential is similar to that of PtCo-Co/TiM. To drive a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, overpotentials of 28, 94, and 40 mV are demanded for the PtCo-Co/TiM, PtO2-CCH/TiM, and Pt/C catalysts, respectively. To make a quantitative comparison, the current densities of PtO2-CCH/TiM, PtCo-Co/TiM and Pt/C at -0.07 V are measured. At an overpotential of 70 mV, the

current densities for the PtO2-CCH/TiM and PtCo-Co/TiM and

Pt/C are 6.4, 46.5 and 25.9 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, respectively. It is found

that the current density of PtCo-Co/TiM is 7.3 and 1.8 times higher than those of the PtO<sub>2</sub>-CCH/TiM and Pt/C, respectively.

The electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) of the electrocatalyst, which is generally proportional to the doublelayer capacitance ( $C_{\rm dl}$ ), has been further investigated to estimate the electrocatalytic activity. As shown in Fig. S8, the cyclic voltammograms (CVs) for PtO2-CCH/TiM and PtCo-Co/TiM are collected in the region of -0.1 to 0 V. The doublelayer capacitances for PtO2-CCH/TiM and PtCo-Co/TiM are measured as 7.4 and 1.2 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>, respectively (Fig. 2c), indicating PtCo-Co/TiM has a much higher surface roughness and thus exposes more active sites for HER catalysis.35 Although the overpotential can evaluate the catalytic activity, various tests with different loading mass make it difficult to accurately assess the catalytic performance. Therefore, turnover frequency (TOF) gradually becomes a critical criterion to estimate the catalytic activity. The TOF is calculated from the ECSA and mass-normalized by polarization curves of PtO<sub>2</sub>-CCH/TiM and PtCo-Co/TiM, as displayed in Fig. 2d. The TOF of H<sub>2</sub> molecules evolved per second (represented as s<sup>-1</sup>) is calculated to be 1.23 s<sup>-1</sup> at 100 mV for the PtCo-Co/TiM, which is higher than that of  $PtO_2$ -CCH/TiM (0.80 s<sup>-1</sup>), demonstrating the superior HER catalytic activity of PtCo-

The HER kinetics of the above electrocatalysts is further analyzed by their corresponding Tafel plots by fitting the experiment data with the Tafel equation ( $\eta = a + b \log(j)$ , where  $\eta$  is overpotential, j is the current density, and b is the Tafel slope). For the alkaline HER, the rate determining step of electrocatalysts is electrochemical reduction of H2O into adsorbed OH\* and H\* (the Volmer reaction) due to great difficulty of catalysts in breaking the H-O-H bond under alkaline media. 36-38 As shown in Fig. 2b, the PtCo-Co/TiM exhibits a Tafel slop of 35 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>, which is better than that of the PtO2-CCH NA/TiM (109 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>) and commercial Pt/C (46 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>), demonstrating the superior HER kinetics of PtCo-Co/TiM. To the best of our knowledge, this Tafel slop is the best value in alkaline media<sup>39</sup> and close to the theoretical value of Pt in acidic media (29 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>). It is found that the HER mechanism on both PtCo-Co/TiM and Pt/C might be the Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism. The lower Tafel slope demonstrates that the alloying of Pt with Co facilitates the HER in alkaline media. Previous report found that Pt<sub>0.1</sub>Ru<sub>0.9</sub> catalyst exhibited outstanding activity for the alkaline HER owing to more oxophilic sites adsorbed on Ru atoms, which facilitates the adsorption of hydroxyl species (OH\*). 40 Similar mechanism might be feasible in our case, that is, the Co atoms can stabilize the hydroxyl species, thus promoting the water dissociation.

The multi-step chronopotentiometric curve was conducted to estimate the electrochemical performance of PtCo-Co/TiM at current densities ranging 10 from 100 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> with an increment of 10 mA  ${\rm cm}^{-2}$  per 500 s (Fig. 2e). The potential immediately levels off at -0.93 V and maintains stable for 500 s, and the rest steps also show similar results, reflecting excellent conductivity, rapid mass transport, and good mechanical robustness of PtCo-Co/TiM. 41,42 The Faradic efficiency (FE) reflects the electric charge transfer efficiency in an electrochemical system, which is calculated by comparing

Long-term durability of electrocatalysts is a crucial parameter for practical applications. We measure the stability of PtCo-Co/TiM by cyclic voltammentry (CV) technology and chronopotentiometry test (current-time curve). The durability of PtCo-Co/TiM is estimated by comparing the polarization curves before and after 1000 continuous CV cycles running at the scan rate of 100 mV s<sup>-1</sup> with the potentials of +0.20 and -0.20 V. The polarization curve after 1000 cycles almost overlays with the initial one (Fig. 3a), suggesting good endurance of PtCo-Co/TiM. Moreover, long-term durability test is conducted at fixed current density of 20 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> to monitor potential for more than 50 h (Fig. 3b). The result shows that the potential remains relatively stable with only a slight increase, suggesting a limited loss of HER activity. These remarkably results vlami the superior long-term electrochemical durability of this catalyst electrode due to the excellent structural stability of PtCo-Co/TiM. We can see from the SEM image that the PtCo-Co/TiM still preserves nanoarray characteristics without obvious structural change after 1000 cycles, showing an excellent mechanical robustness (Fig. 3c). The HRTEM image of PtCo-Co (Fig. S9) also shows no aggregation of PtCo NPs after long-term durability test. From the Fig. 3d, the PtCo-Co still exhibits an intimate contact between PtCo and Co, indicating no change of the structure of PtCo-Co. These results confirm that the PtCo-Co/TiM is a stable electrocatalyst in alkaline media.

It is assumed that the outstanding activity of PtCo-Co/TiM is mainly ascribed to strong synergetic effect of its favorable composition and structure. The PtCo tends to be easier for hydrogen adsorption and convertion than Pt due to the strong electronic effect between Pt and Co. On the other hand, Co is capable of breaking HO-H bonds. Thus, the PtCo-Co structure exhibit significant synergistic effects in the HER process, where

Co species initiate water dissociation and PtCo atoms are responsible for the adsorption of resulting hydrogen intermediates and their subsequent conversion to H2. To elucidate the superb HER activity of the PtCo-Co/TiM in alkaline media, we performed DFT calculations. For HER, Gibbs free energy is usually employed as a key descriptor in predicting theoretical activity for hydrogen evolution reaction. An ideal free energy for hydrogen species ( $\Delta G_{H^*}$ ) of approximates 0 eV would lead to optimal HER activity with a lower reaction barrier due to the balance between the adsorption and the desorption of hydrogen species.44 Therefore, we calculate the  $\Delta G_{H^*}$  on the surface of PtCo in comparison to Co surface (See ESI and Table S2 for calculation details). Fig. 4 shows the free energy barriers for the alkaline HER on the Pt (111) surface, Co (111) surface and PtCo (100) surface. We can see that the calculated  $\Delta G_{H^*}$  for Pt (111) surface is about -0.134 eV. However, for the Co (111) surface, the corresponding value (-0.265 eV) is much smaller than that of Pt catalyst, suggesting that the desorption of H\* from the Co surface is significantly suppressed and thus hydrogen production is greatly hindered. When Pt is alloyed with Co to form the PtCo catalyst, we find that the  $\Delta G_{H^*}$  on PtCo (100) surface are much smaller and closer to the optimal value ( $\Delta G_{H^*}$ ≈ 0); two inequivalent adsorption sites on PtCo (100) surface (red and purple) are considered. In fact, the Pt termination of PtCo (100) (Pt term. of PtCo) surface has a slight lower  $\Delta G_{H^*}$  (-0.071 eV) than that on Pt (111), suggesting that it can be as efficient as Pt for the production of hydrogen. Impressively, the Co termination of PtCo (100) (Pt term. of PtCo) surface has a near-zero  $\Delta G_{H^*}$  (-0.011 eV), suggesting its unprecedented HER activity. This is because the hydrogen species have strong interaction with both Pt and Co atoms on the surface of PtCo, which plays a more powerful role in the hydrogen adsorption than pure Pt, thus the PtCo achieves a favourable  $\Delta G_{H^*}$  for the adsorption and desorption of hydrogen. The results clearly confirm that PtCo catalyst does have an excellent HER performance, which is consistent with the experimental observations. Overall, the experimental and theoretical results verify that as-made PtCo-Co/TiM is an unparalleled HER electrocatalyst in alkaline media.

In summary, we demonstrate the development of ultrafine PtCo alloy nanoparticles decorated one-dimensional Co nanowire array hybrid. Owing to the ultrafine PtCo NPs and synergistic effects of heterostructure, the PtCo-Co/TiM exhibits unprecedented performance for alkaline HER. The PtCo-Co/TiM can deliver an ultrahigh current density of 46.5 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> at an overpotential of 70 mV, which manifests a factor of 1.8 activity increase in catalyzing the alkaline HER relative to state-of-the-art Pt/C (25.9 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>). This catalyst also exhibits excellent long-term durability for at least 50 h with limited activity loss. This investigation not only provides a novel HER electrocatalyst with unparalleled activity but opens a new avenue for the development of low-Pt nanoarray catalysts. These electrocatalysts can also be explored in various electrocatalytic energy and sensing 45-47 as well as hydrolytic hydrogen production 48,49 applications.

Crystal-phase-engineering provides a powerful strategy for regulating the catalytic performance yet remains great challenge. Herein, the kinetic-modulated crystal-phase-control of Ru nanosheet assemblies (Ru NAs) is demonstrated by simply altering the concentration of citric acid (CA). Detailed experimental results reveal that high concentration of CA retards the growth kinetics and thus leads to the formation of metastable face-centered cubic (fcc) Ru NAs, while low concentration of CA results in the fast growth kinetics and the preferential formation of Ru NAs with stable hexagonal close packed (hcp) phase. Moreover, Ru NAs with different phases are used as catalyst for hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) to evaluate the effects of crystal phase on catalytic performance. Impressively, Ru NAs with fcc phase display a mass activity of 2.75 A mg<sub>Pu</sub><sup>-1</sup> at 50 mV, which is much higher than those of Ru NAs with fcc/ hcp (1.02 A mg<sub>Ru</sub><sup>-1</sup>) and hcp (0.74 A mg<sub>Ru</sub><sup>-1</sup>) phases. Theoretical calculations show that fcc Ru NAs display weaker adsorption toward "H and lower energy barrier toward the rate-determining step (RDS) during HOR. This work provides a facile strategy for regulating the crystal phase of Ru nanocrystals, which may attract rapid interests of researchers in materials, chemistry, and catalysis.

1. Introduction

Recently, Ru has drawn extensive attentions in electrocatalysis due to its lower price but comparable activity in comparison to Pt.<sup>[1–3]</sup> Over the past decades, tremendous efforts have been devoted to the modification of Ru-based catalysts for improving their activity and stability.<sup>[4–6]</sup> Despite huge progress have

achieved, great challenges related to the low activity and insufficient stability of the Ru-based catalysts still remain, which motivate researchers to deeply investigate the intrinsic structural-performance correlation.<sup>[7-9]</sup> Considering the catalytic performance is largely dependent on the structures of surface atoms, on which the different adsorption abilities to reactants, intermediates and products will lead to the varied catalytic performance.[10,11] Typical for Ru nanocrystals (NCs), it has been reported that the face-centered cubic (fcc) phase of Ru NCs displays higher activity than that of hexagonal close packed (hcp) phase Ru NCs.[12-15] Nevertheless, the hcp phase is thermodynamically stable compared to Ru NCs with fcc phase.[16-18] Therefore, the fabrication of Ru NCs with tailored structures is of great importance yet challenging.

Over the past decades, great attention has been paid to the controllable synthesis

of Ru NCs with fcc structure.<sup>[19–21]</sup> Kitagawa et al. reported that the final phase of Ru nanoparticles is strongly depended on the type of precursor.<sup>[22]</sup> Typically, Ru nanoparticles with fcc phase were obtained when Ru(acac)<sub>3</sub> was used as precursor, while Ru nanoparticles with hcp phase were prepared when RuCl<sub>3</sub>·nH<sub>2</sub>O was used as precursor.<sup>[22]</sup> They claimed that the dissolution of Ru(acac)<sub>3</sub> in organic solvent as a neutral molecule led to the

formation of fcc structure, while the dissolution of  $RuCl_3 \cdot nH_2O$  as ion state resulted in the formation of hcp structure. Moreover, the epitaxial and seed-mediated growth enable the anisotropic growth of seeds into the fcc structure. Zhang et al. synthesized fcc Ru nanorods (NRs) via the epitaxial growth of 4H/fcc Au nanowires (NWs). [23] Xia and co-workers used Rh nanoparticles as seeds for fabricating fcc Ru with atomic layers through over growth. [14] Despite the huge progress, the current strategies for fabricating fcc Ru NCs are complicated and time-consuming, which severely limited further investigations and practical applications.

In this work, we demonstrate a kinetic control strategy for precisely modulating the crystal phase of Ru nanosheet assemblies (NAs) by simply altering the concentration of citric acid (CA). Detailed experimental results reveal that high concentration of CA can induce the formation of metastable fcc Ru nucleus and the orientated growth of fcc Ru NAs. In contrast, low concentration of CA leads to fast kinetics during nucleation and growth, as a result of the formation of thermodynamically stable hcp Ru NAs. Moreover, fcc Ru NAs display a mass activity of 2.75 A  $mg_{Ru}^{-1}$  at 50 mV toward hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR), which is much higher than those of fcc/hcp Ru NAs (1.02 A  $mg_{Ru}^{-1}$ ) and hcp Ru NAs (0.74 A  $mg_{Ru}^{-1}$ ). This work not only provides a facile strategy for fabricating Ru NCs with fcc phase, but also highlights the significance of crystal phase toward catalysis.

### 2. Results and Discussion

Ru NAs were prepared through a chemical approach by using dodecarbonyl triruthenium ( $Ru_3(CO)_{12}$ ) as the metallic precursor, CA as coordination agent, oleylamine as the solvent, respectively (see details in Supporting Information). By altering the concentration of CA, Ru NAs with different crystalline structures were obtained. As shown in **Scheme 1**, high concentration

of CA leads to the formation of fcc Ru NAs, while low concentration of CA results in the formation of hcp Ru NAs. Three different crystal phase samples (fcc Ru NAs, fcc/hcp Ru NAs, and hcp Ru NAs) were obtained by gradually reducing the dosage of CA (200, 150, and 100 mg). The fcc and hcp structures of Ru are evidenced by their characteristic peaks in X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns (Figure 1a). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images show that the alteration of CA concentration has negligible influence on the morphologies of Ru, while the size distribution was increased with the CA concentration (Figure 1b-g and Figures S1-S3, Supporting Information). High-magnification TEM image reveals that Ru NAs are assembled by small pieces of tentacles (Figure S4, Supporting Information). The lattice distance of 0.202 nm in the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image can be assigned to the (200) facet of fcc Ru (Figure 1c), while the lattice distances of 0.214 and 0.230 nm are ascribed to the (002) and (100) facets of hcp Ru (Figure 1e,g). Moreover, the quadrangle nature in the fast Fourier transform (FFT) pattern further confirms the fcc structure of Ru (inset of Figure 1c), while the hexagonal FFT pattern validates the hcp structure of Ru (inset of Figure 1g).

The ultralow frequency Raman spectra were also collected to further study the structure of Ru NAs with different phases. As shown in **Figure 2a**, the peaks at ≈186.3 cm<sup>-1</sup> in the Raman spectra are ascribed to hcp Ru. [<sup>24,25</sup>] In the Raman spectrum of fcc Ru NAs, the peak positively shifts by ≈6.3 cm<sup>-1</sup> compared to that of hcp Ru NAs. For fcc/hcp Ru NAs, the peak can be deconvoluted into two peaks corresponding to fcc Ru NAs and hcp Ru NAs, respectively. In addition, the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were collected to further analyze surface electronic properties of Ru NAs with different phases. As shown in Figure 2b, the peaks located at 462.5 and 485.1 eV can be assigned to the Ru<sup>0</sup> 3p<sub>3/2</sub> and 3p<sub>1/2</sub>, while peaks at 466.0 and 488.6 eV are ascribed to Ru<sup>4+</sup> 3p<sub>3/2</sub> and 3p<sub>1/2</sub>, respectively. [<sup>21,26,27</sup>] The binding energy of Ru<sup>0</sup> 3p<sub>3/2</sub> for fcc Ru NAs is 462.5 eV, which is slightly higher than those of fcc/hcp Ru

NAs (462.4 eV) and hcp Ru NAs (462.2 eV). Simultaneously, the value of d-band center of fcc Ru NAs is −3.23 eV, which is further away from the Fermi level than those of fcc/hcp Ru NAs (−3.04 eV) and hcp Ru NAs (−2.68 eV) (Figure 2c,d). The chemical states of Ru in fcc Ru NAs, fcc/hcp Ru NAs, and hcp Ru NAs were studied by X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra at Ru K-edge.[28,29] The spectral features and energy positions of fcc Ru NAs, fcc/hcp Ru NAs, and hcp Ru NAs are very similar to those of Ru foil (Figure 2e), indicating that Ru are mainly in metallic state in the above samples. The enlarged XANES spectra indicate that the energy of K-edge position follows the order of fcc Ru NAs > fcc/hcp Ru NAs > hcp Ru NAs (inset of Figure 2e), indicating that the Ru hcp phase is thermodynamically stable compared to Ru fcc phase. Moreover, the local environment of Ru ion was explored by the Fourier transform of extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra at the Ru K-edge.[30,31] As shown in Figure 2f, the intense peaks at ≈2.4 Å are be assigned to the Ru–Ru coordination, further confirming the metallic state of Ru in fcc Ru NAs, fcc/hcp Ru NAs, and hcp Ru NAs.

The growth kinetics were further investigated to reveal the formation mechanism of Ru NAs with different structures. First, the real pictures of growth solutions during growth were collected. As shown in **Figure 3**a, the color of solution evolves from yellowish to dark grey with the increased growth time, suggesting the formation of Ru NAs. Note that the required time for the evolution from yellowish to dark gray increases with the concentration of CA (Figure 3a), suggesting the kinetics is inversely proportional to the concentration of CA. Moreover, the residual Ru in the solution was measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) to further study the growth kinetics. As shown in Figure 3b, the different amounts of Ru in the solution suggest that high concentration of CA strongly retards the growth kinetics. Typical for fcc Ru NAs, the required time for the complete growth is ≈80 min, which is much longer than those of hcp and hcp/fcc Ru NAs, further confirming the negative influence of CA concentration on the growth kinetics. In addition, we collected the TEM images of nucleus at the initial stage. As shown in Figure 3c–e, the nucleus with a mean size of ≈2 nm assembles to nanoclusters. The lattice distances of 0.221 and 0.201 nm can be indexed as the (111) and (200) facets of fcc Ru, respectively (Figure 3f). As decreasing the amount of CA, a mixture of fcc and hcp Ru nucleus were obtained, as revealed by the presence of the lattice distances of 0.203 ((200) facet of fcc Ru) and 0.232 nm ((100) facet of hcp Ru) (Figure 3g). Further decrease of CA amount leads to the formation of hcp Ru nucleus, as depicted by the lattice distance of (100) facet of hcp Ru (Figure 3h). The above results indicate that the amount of CA plays a crucial role in the formation Ru nucleus. Specifically, high concentration of CA leads to slow growth kinetics and thus forms metastable fcc Ru nucleus, while low concentration of CA results in fast kinetics and therefore the formation of thermodynamically stable hcp Ru nucleus.

Given that the catalytic performance of Ru strongly depends on the crystal phase,[16,32] Ru NAs with different structures were

loaded on commercial carbon (Vulcan XC-72R) and annealed at 200 °C for 1 h in the air to remove the residual solvent (Figures S5 and S6, Supporting Information). The HOR performance of fcc Ru NAs, fcc/hcp Ru NAs, and hcp Ru NAs were evaluated in rotating disk electrode (RDE) using a typical threeelectrode system. **Figure 4**a displays the polarization curves of these catalysts in H2-saturated 0.1 m KOH electrolyte with a scan rate of 5 mV s−<sup>1</sup> at a rotation speed of 1600 rpm. The HOR performance on the three Ru-based catalysts follows the order of fcc Ru NAs > fcc/hcp Ru NAs > hcp Ru NAs. Meanwhile, the slopes of the current at micro-polarization regions of these samples also follow the sequence of fcc Ru NAs > fcc/hcp Ru NAs > hcp Ru NAs, implying the highest HOR activity of fcc Ru NAs (Figure 4b). Correspondingly, fcc Ru NAs display the highest electrochemical surface area comparing with fcc/hcp Ru NAs and hcp Ru NAs (Figure S7, Supporting Information). Simultaneously, fcc Ru NAs also exhibit the lowest semicircular diameter among these samples in electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), suggesting fcc Ru NAs favor the electron transfer (Figure S8, Supporting Information). No anodic current was observed in N2-saturated 0.1 m KOH, suggesting the anodic current was mainly derived by H2 oxidation (Figure S9, Supporting Information). The HOR polarization curves of the samples at different rotating speeds imply that the current

densities increase with the elevated rotating speed (Figure 4c). The Koutecky–Levich plots show the linear relationship between the inverse of current density and square root of the rotating speeds (inset of Figure 4c). The calculated slope for fcc Ru is 0.0801 cm<sup>2</sup> mA<sup>-1</sup> rpm<sup>1/2</sup>, indicating the two-electron-transfer process for HOR. Moreover, fcc Ru NAs exhibits the highest kinetic current among the three catalysts (Figure 4d). Furthermore, the mass activity was calculated to further study the influence of crystal structure on the HOR performance. As shown in Figure 4e, the mass activity of fcc Ru NAs at an overpotential of 50 mV is 2.75 A mg<sub>Ru</sub><sup>-1</sup>, which is much higher than those of fcc/hcp Ru NAs (1.02 A mg<sub>Ru</sub><sup>-1</sup>), hcp Ru NAs (0.74 A mg<sub>Ru</sub><sup>-1</sup>), Pt/C (0.43 A mg<sub>Ru</sub><sup>-1</sup>) and other reported electrocatalysts for HOR (Table S1, Supporting Information). Besides, the exchange current density of fcc Ru NAs (8.16 mA cm<sub>disk</sub><sup>-2</sup>)

is 1.33, 2.01, and 4.72 times higher than those of fcc/hcp Ru NAs (6.11 mA cm<sub>disk</sub><sup>-2</sup>), hcp Ru NAs (4.06 mA cm<sub>disk</sub><sup>-2</sup>), and Pt/C (1.73 mA cm<sub>disk</sub><sup>-2</sup>), further confirming the promising HOR activity of fcc Ru NAs. Additionally, the electrochemical stability of Ru with different crystal phases was also tested by Amperometric i–t curves, which was also conducted at an overpotential of 100 mV with continuously rotating at 1600 rpm. As shown in Figure 4f, the current density of fcc Ru NAs decreases by 19%, which is smaller than those of fcc/hcp Ru NAs (31%), hcp Ru NAs (47%), and Ru/C (66%), respectively, after 6000 s continuous i–t test. Meanwhile, TEM images of the spent electrocatalysts reveal that the morphologies and structures of fcc Ru NAs, fcc/hcp Ru NAs and hcp Ru NAs are largely remained (Figures S10 and S11, Supporting Information). Additionally, fcc Ru displays superior hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity

and stability to fcc/hcp Ru NAs and hcp Ru NAs (Figure S12, Supporting Information). As shown in Figure S12 (Supporting Information), the overpotential of fcc Ru NAs for achieving the current density of 10 mA cm−<sup>2</sup> is 17 mV, which is much lower than those of fcc/hcp Ru NAs (32 mV) and hcp Ru NAs (37 mV), respectively. The above results indicate that fcc Ru can serve as highly active and stable catalyst for alkaline HOR and HER.

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to understand the HOR mechanism on fcc Ru and hcp Ru. Generally, the HOR on Ru surface in alkaline media consists of the following steps: 1) H2 molecules adsorb on Ru surface and dissociate into \* H; 2) \* H reacts with the adsorbed \* OH to form \*H2O; 3) \*H2O desorb from the Ru surface.[6,33] In principle, ideal catalysts for HOR should display suitable adsorption toward \*H and enhanced adsorption toward \*OH.[34,35] We therefore calculated the adsorptions of \*H and \*OH on Ru surface to reveal the different HOR performance on fcc Ru and hcp Ru. It is found that the optimal adsorption site for \*H on hcp Ru surface is the *ν*2 site of two Ru atoms with a calculated free energy (∆*G*H\*) of −0.51 eV, while \* H prefers to occupy the µ3 site of four Ru atoms on fcc Ru surface with a free energy (∆*G*H\*) of −0.45 eV (**Figure 5**a−c, Figures S13 and S14, Supporting Information). The above results indicate the weaker \* H

adsorption on fcc Ru surface compared to the hcp Ru surface, which is consistent with polarization curves of these samples in N<sub>2</sub>-saturated 0.1 м КОН (Figure S15, Supporting Information). Moreover, the Gibbs free energies of \*OH adsorption ( $\Delta G_{\text{OH*}}$ ) on different adsorption sites were calculated. As shown in Figures S16 and S17 (Supporting Information), the optimal sites of \*OH on the fcc and hcp Ru surfaces are the hollow and bridge sites, respectively. Additionally, DFT calculations demonstrate that the formation of \*H + \*H<sub>2</sub>O is the rate determining step (RDS) for HOR on Ru surface (Figure 5d and Figure S18, Supporting Information). Note that the energy barrier for the RDS on fcc Ru is smaller than that of hcp Ru, suggesting that fcc Ru exhibits superior HOR performance to hcp Ru, being consistent with experimental results.[32]

### 3. Conclusion

-1.6

In summary, we have demonstrated a facile strategy for precisely modulating the crystal phase of Ru NAs via kinetic control by altering the concentration of CA, in which slow kinetics leads to the formation metastable fcc nucleus and nanocrystals, while fast kinetics results in the formation of thermodynamically stable hcp Ru nanocrystals. Theoretical calculations suggest that the formation of \*H + \*H<sub>2</sub>O is the RDS for HOR on Ru surface. In particular, fcc Ru displays a weaker \*H adsorption and lower barrier for RDS compared to hcp Ru, as a result of superior HOR performance of fcc Ru to hcp Ru. Consequently, Ru NAs with fcc structure display a mass activity of 2.75 A mg<sub>Ru</sub><sup>-1</sup> at 50 mV, which is much higher than those of Ru NAs with fcc/ hcp (1.02 A  $mg_{Ru}^{-1}$ ) and hcp (0.74 A  $mg_{Ru}^{-1}$ ) phases, as well as

other reported catalysts for HOR. Moreover, Ru NAs with fcc structure display superior stability to hcp Ru NAs for HOR. This work provides a facile strategy for regulating the crystal phase of Ru nanocrystals, which may attract rapid interests of researchers in materials, chemistry, and catalysis.

### 4. Experimental Section

Synthesis of fcc Ru NAs, fcc/hcp Ru NAs, and hcp Ru NAs. For the synthesis of fcc Ru NAs, 10 mg Ru<sub>3</sub>(CO)<sub>12</sub>, and 200 mg CA were dissolved in 5 mL oleylamine to form a homogeneous solution in a glass vial (30 mL). Then the homogeneous solution was heated to 240 °C and maintained this temperature for 4 h. The products were collected by centrifugation and washed with a mixture of ethanol and cyclohexane with the volume ratio of 8:1 for 3 times. The synthesis of fcc/hcp Ru NAs and hcp Ru NAs were similar to that of fcc Ru except the dosages of CA were decreased to 150 and 100 mg, respectively.

Characterization: TEM images were collected on JEOL (100 kV). HAADF-STEM and HRTEM images were collected on FEI Tecnai F30 TEM with an accelerating voltage of 300 kV. The inductively coupled plasma optical spectra (ICP-MS) was carried out on iCAP700 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA USA). XRD patterns were recorded on Rigaku equipped with Cu Klpha. XPS measurement was operated on SSI S-Probe XPS spectrometer. Raman spectrum was performed on LabRAM HR Evolution (Horiba). The XANES and EXAFS spectra were collected at TPS 44A beamline of National Synchrotron Radiation Research Centre (NSRRC, Hsinchu) in the transmission mode.

Electrochemical Measurements: Prior to electrocatalytic test, Ru NAs with different structures were loaded on commercial carbon (Vulcan XC-72R) and annealed at 200 °C for 1 h in the air to remove the residual solvent. The electrochemical data were recorded at CHI660 electrochemical station with a three-electrode system (Chenhua, Shanghai).[36] For the preparation of the electrocatalyst ink, carbon supported samples (2 mg), isopropanol (990 µL), and Nafion solution (10 μL, 5 wt%) were added at a glass vial (5 mL) and then ultrasonicated for 1 h. For HOR, 5 µL ink was dropped on the GC electrode, resulting in a catalyst loading of 0.05 mg cm<sup>-2</sup> on the GC. The equilibrium potential was the zero point of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER)/ HOR by using Pt/C as working electrode rotating at 1600 rpm in H<sub>2</sub>saturated electrolyte. Solution resistance was tested by AC-impedance spectroscopy from 0.1 kHz to 100 mHz.

DFT Calculations: The DFT calculations were performed by the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) with projector augmented wave (PAW).[37,38] The exchange-correlation interaction was described by the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE), which is based on the generalized gradient approximation (GGA). [39,40] The van der Waals (vdW) interaction was considered by the DFT-D3 method. The plane-wave cutoff energy was set to 500 eV, and the force convergence criterion for optimization was 0.02 eV Å $^{-1}.$  The vacuum space was set to 15 Å. The  $2\times2$  and  $3\times2$ supercell of Ru (100) surface was employed as slab models to represent the fcc and hcp Ru NAs, respectively. The top two atomic layers of slab models were allowed to relax during the calculations. Spin polarizations was considered in all calculations. The Gibbs free energy ( $\Delta G$ ) for all reactions was obtained by the following formula:[41]

$$\Delta G = \Delta E + \Delta Z P E - T \Delta S \tag{1}$$

In this formula, the  $\Delta E$ ,  $\Delta ZPE$ , and  $T\Delta S$  respectively represent the total electric energy, zero-point energy, and entropic contributions, respectively.

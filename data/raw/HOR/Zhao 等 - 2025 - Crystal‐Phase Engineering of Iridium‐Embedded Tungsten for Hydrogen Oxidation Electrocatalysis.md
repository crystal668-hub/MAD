# **Crystal-Phase Engineering of Iridium-Embedded Tungsten for Hydrogen Oxidation Electrocatalysis**

*Lei Zhao, Bo Ouyang, Yisong Yang, Jingtao Li, and Kun Xu\**

**Understanding the phase structure-dependent catalytic performance is of great significance for the investigation of advanced electrocatalysts. At present, research in phase engineering of metal materials for electrocatalysis predominantly concentrates on the iron group, platinum group, and coinage group metals with A1-, A2-, and A3- type structures. However, the investigation of metal phase engineering beyond the above metal group with other types of structures for electrocatalysis is still poorly explored. Herein, using tungsten as a substrate to support iridium, it is shown that iridium-embedded tungsten with diverse crystal phase structure (referred to as Ir/-W for A2-type structure and Ir/-W for A-15 type structure) exhibits distinct catalytic activity for hydrogen oxidation reactions (HOR) in alkaline medium. Notably, the mass-normalized exchange current density (j0, m) of noble metal iridium in Ir/-W (518.3 A g<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> Ir) is ≈1.8 times and 16.4 times higher than that of Ir/-W and Ir/C, respectively. In-depth mechanistic studies suggest that the enhanced HOR performance on Ir/-W is attributed to the enhanced connectivity of the H-bond network as well as the synergistic optimization of the adsorption binding energies of H and OH intermediate species. This study can inspire more scientific interest on the exploration of metal phase engineering for electrocatalysis.**

the modern chemical industry. In particular, the development of advanced metalbased electrocatalysts with high catalytic activity has always been a central concern. Traditionally, precise control over the architecture, size, and composition is essential for regulating catalyst performance. In addition to the above-mentioned modulation tools, the crystal phase, which is defined as a specific arrangement or ordering of atoms in a crystalline material, is also recognized as a fundamental parameter in modulating catalytic performance.[\[1\]](#page-8-0) By regulating the metal crystal phase, the coordination environment and electronic structure configuration can be controlled. Consequently, the adsorption of reaction intermediates would be optimized, and thereby achieving the enhancement of the catalytic activity.[\[2\]](#page-8-0) Therefore, it is imperative to investigate the constitutive relationship between the metal crystal phase and electrocatalytic performance, thus promoting the development of advanced electrocatalysts with high catalytic activity. Accordingly, significant endeavors have

been dedicated to the exploration of crystalline phase engineering in electrocatalysis. For example, it has been reported that the Pt-embedded metastable Ni nanosheets with A3-type structure achieve highly efficient hydrogen evolution, in which the metastable Ni promotes water dissociation, hydrogen adsorption, and migration.[\[3\]](#page-8-0) Moreover, the MoOx-modified Ru with A1- or A3-type structure exhibits significantly different catalytic performance due to the varied crystal phase and electronic structure.[\[1d\]](#page-8-0) Additionally, the investigation of the phase engineering of PdCu alloy also suggests that the thermodynamically stable A2-type structure possesses higher hydrogen oxidation performance owing to the optimized adsorption/desorption of intermediates.[\[4\]](#page-8-0) However, phase engineering studies of metal materials for electrocatalysis have predominantly centered around the iron group, platinum group, and coinage group metals with A1-, A2-, and A3 type structures, and phase engineering studies beyond the above metal group with other types of crystalline structures have often been neglected.[\[5\]](#page-8-0)

Tungsten, as one of the group-VIB metals, is characterized by good conductivity, ductility, high stability, and abundant reserves.[\[6\]](#page-8-0) In this regard, W could serve as an ideal substrate supporting precious metals for the design of advanced catalysts with excellent activity. However, tungsten features two

distinctive crystal structures, namely the thermodynamically stable  $\alpha$ -W with A2-type crystal structure (high-temperature phase) and the metastable  $\beta$ -W with A15-type structure (lowtemperature phase), and the phase-dependent catalytic performance is still elusive. To address above issue, we herein report the preparation of iridium-embedded tungsten with two distinct crystal phases, namely  $Ir/\alpha$ -W and  $Ir/\beta$ -W, respectively (Scheme 1). Moreover, hydrogen oxidation reactions (HOR) in alkaline medium were employed as a proof-of-concept application to illustrate the impact of crystal phase engineering of tungsten on tunable electrocatalytic activity. Notably, the  $Ir/\alpha$ -W with A2-type structure sample shows excellent electrocatalytic activity in HOR with a mass-normalized exchange current density  $(j_{0,m})$ of 518 A  $g^{-1}_{Ir}$ , which is  $\approx$ 1.8 and 16.4 times higher than that of  $Ir/\beta$ -W with A15-type structure and Ir/C, and stands at the top level among the reported catalysts. In-depth mechanistic studies unraveled that  $Ir/\alpha$ -W exhibits enhanced H-bond network connectivity, and relatively weaker hydrogen binding energy (HBE), stronger hydroxyl binding energy (OHBE) in comparison with  $Ir/\beta$ -W, which significantly affects the HOR activity.

#### 2. Results and Discussion

In this study, the synthesis procedure of the  $Ir/\alpha$ -W with A2-type structure and the  $Ir/\beta$ -W with A15-type structure is illustrated in Figure 1a. Specifically, Ir species were first adsorbed onto ultrafine nanowires of W<sub>18</sub>O<sub>49</sub> by impregnation method (Figures S1 and S2, Supporting Information), and then the  $Ir/\alpha$ -W and  $Ir/\beta$ -W were synthesized by annealing the prepared  $Ir/W_{18}O_{49}$ precursors at different annealing temperatures under 5% H<sub>2</sub>/Ar atmosphere. XRD characterization was first employed to investigate the crystalline structural information of the prepared samples. As shown in Figure S3 (Supporting Information), the characteristic diffraction peaks of  $Ir/\alpha$ -W located at 40.3°, 58.3°, and 73.2° corresponded to the (110), (200), and (211) facets of pure  $\alpha$ -W (PDF#04-0806), respectively, and no peaks associated with Ir can be observed, which may be due to the low loading of Ir. Meanwhile, the diffraction peaks of  $Ir/\alpha$ -W exhibit a slight shift toward higher angular directions due to the introduction of Ir with small atomic radius compared with pure  $\alpha$ -W (Figure S4, Supporting Information). Similarly, the  $Ir/\beta$ -W displays the same diffraction peak as pure  $\beta$ -W (PDF#47-1319) without any peaks associated with Ir (Figure S5, Supporting Information). Note that the crystal phase structures of both  $Ir/\alpha$ -W and  $Ir/\beta$ -W remained unchanged after being kept for over 10 months (Figure S6, Supporting Information). Moreover, the TEM images of  $Ir/\alpha$ -W and  $Ir/\beta$ -W in Figure S7 (Supporting Information) reveal the particle morphology. To further explore the existence form of Ir in  $Ir/\alpha$ -W and  $Ir/\beta$ -W, in situ CO diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform (CO-DRIFT) experiments were conducted, and the results indicate that Ir is embedded in the lattice of W in an atomically dispersed form (Figure S8, Supporting Information).<sup>[7]</sup> In addition, the inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) indicates Ir loading of 1.50 wt.% for Ir/ $\alpha$ -W and 1.49 wt.% for  $Ir/\beta$ -W, respectively. It is well known that metastable phases are non-equilibrium phases that can exist under certain conditions and time scales due to kinetic barriers or resistance. [8] Additionally, it is widely known that the growth of materials is controlled by thermodynamics and kinetics. According to thermodynamics, atoms are arranged in the most stable form with the lowest free energy, while kinetics control the path and time scale to reach the thermodynamic state. During the synthesis process of materials, atomic arrangements may be hindered at the local minimum of free energy, resulting in the formation of metastable products. Furthermore, the formation of metastable phases requires certain energy conditions (Gm), which can be achieved by external processes that provide excess enthalpy or excess free energy to the material system (Figure \$9, Supporting Information).[9] Therefore, precise temperature control is crucial for the synthesis of both crystal phases of W in this work. As shown in Figure 1b,c,

and Figure \$10 (Supporting Information), at a temperature of 500 °C, only diffraction peaks corresponding to  $W_{18}O_{49}$  can be observed. When the temperature is increased to 600 °C, the characteristic peaks of W<sub>18</sub>O<sub>49</sub> decrease and peaks corresponding to WO<sub>2</sub> and  $\beta$ -W appear. Further heating to 620 °C, pure  $\beta$ -W without any impurities could be prepared. In the temperature range of 650–700 °C, a partial transformation of  $\beta$ -W to  $\alpha$ -W phase occurs. When the temperature reaches 800 °C, the  $\beta$ -W phase completely transforms into  $\alpha$ -W phase. In addition to precise temperature control, the addition of Ir also plays an important role in the preparation of pure metastable W. As shown in Figure 1d,e, and Figure S11 (Supporting Information), in the absence of Ir, the coexistence of  $W_{18}O_{49}$ ,  $\beta$ -W, and  $\alpha$ -W is observed in the range of 600–620 °C. WO<sub>2</sub> and  $\alpha$ -W coexist in the range of 650–700 °C. At 800 °C, characteristic peaks of pure  $\alpha$ -W can be observed. These results indicate that the transformation of  $\alpha$ -W can be rapidly completed at high temperatures regardless of the presence of Ir. However, pure  $\beta$ -W cannot be obtained without Ir. Therefore, possible mechanisms regarding the role of Ir in the formation of two crystal phases W have been proposed. The introduction of Ir enhances the adsorption, dissociation, and overflow of hydrogen on the material surface, significantly promoting the formation of metastable W phase at relatively lower temperatures. [10] In addition, the introduction of Ir changes the local surface energy and delays the transformation of thermally stable W phase. [11]

High-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) was then performed to study the structural details of the samples more intuitively. As exhibited in Figure 1f, the HAADF-STEM shows relatively regular lattice with lattice distances of 0.22 nm, attributed to the (110) plane of  $\alpha$ -W (Note: Distinguishing between W and Ir atoms in HAADF images is challenging because of the close atomic numbers). No agglomerated Ir clusters or nanoparticles can be observed. Simultaneously, the HAADF-TEM image matches well with the

simulated crystal structure of  $\alpha$ -W presented in Figure 1g. Furthermore, the energy-dispersive X-ray spectrum (EDX) verifies that Ir has been successfully incorporated and that Ir and W are uniformly distributed throughout entire particle (Figure S12, Supporting Information). In the case of  $Ir/\beta$ -W, as shown in Figure 1h, the HAADF-STEM image exhibits a lattice spacing of 0.51 nm, aligning with the  $\beta$ -W (100) crystal plane (Figure 1i). EDX analysis of  $Ir/\beta$ -W, similar to  $Ir/\alpha$ -W, demonstrates a uniform distribution of Ir and W elements (Figure S13, Supporting Information). XPS analysis was conducted to further reveal the surface chemical state of the synthesized Ir/W. As illustrated in Figures S14a and S15a (Supporting Information), the Ir 4f XPS spectra present the binding energy at ≈61 and ≈64 eV, which can be attributed to  $Ir^0$   $4f_{7/2}$  and  $Ir^0$   $4f_{5/2}$ , respectively.<sup>[12]</sup> (Note: Given that the electronegativities of Ir and W are 2.2 and 1.7, respectively, Ir should exhibit a metallic state in this environment.) The peaks at  $\approx$ 62 and  $\approx$ 65 eV are assigned to Ir<sup>4+</sup> from surface oxidation.<sup>[13]</sup> Notably, the Ir 4f binding energy of  $Ir/\alpha$ -W is slightly shifted to the lower-energy region compared

to that of  ${\rm Ir}/\beta$ -W, suggesting significant electron interaction in  ${\rm Ir}/\alpha$ -W. As for the high resolution W 4f XPS spectra (Figures S14b and S15b, Supporting Information), the peaks located at  $\approx 31.4$  and  $\approx 33.6$  eV corresponding to the W $^0$  4f $_{7/2}$  and W $^0$  4f $_{5/2}$ , respectively. Analogously, the W 4f binding energy of  ${\rm Ir}/\alpha$ -W slightly shifted to the higher energy in comparison with  ${\rm Ir}/\beta$ -W. Thus, all the above results clearly prove the successful synthesis of the  ${\rm Ir}/\alpha$ -W with A2-type structure and the  ${\rm Ir}/\beta$ -W with A15-type structure. For comparison, catalysts calcined at other annealing temperatures and Ir nanoparticles supported on carbon black (Ir/C) were also synthesized (Figures S16 and S17, Supporting Information).

XAFS measurements were performed to further investigate the localized electronic structure and coordination environment of the two samples (Figure S18, Supporting Information). Figure 2a shows the X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectra of the two crystalline phases of Ir-W by using the W and WO<sub>3</sub> powder as references. The W L<sub>3</sub>-edge adsorption energy of both  $Ir/\alpha$ -W and  $Ir/\beta$ -W is close to that of W powder and

lower than that of WO<sub>3</sub>, suggesting the metallic characteristic of the two samples. Meanwhile,  $Ir/\beta$ -W in W L<sub>3</sub>-edge XANES spectra exhibits higher white-line peak intensity than that of  $Ir/\alpha$ -W, probably due to different localized electronic structure of the two samples. The absorption edges of W and Ir are shown in Table S1 (Supporting Information). More detailed local coordination environment on W sites in the two crystalline phases of W can be obtained from extended XAFS (EXAFS) analysis. As depicted in the Fourier transform-EXAFS (FT- EXAFS) spectra (Figure 2b),  $Ir/\alpha$ -W exhibits a main peak at 2.60 Å, attributed to W-W shell, while  $Ir/\beta$ -W shows a larger W-W shell distance at 2.84 Å. To reveal the local coordination structure, the W L<sub>3</sub>-edge EXAFS spectra were fitted as shown in Figure 2c-f. According to the fitting results presented in Table S2 (Supporting Information), it is observed that the  $Ir/\alpha$ -W exhibits two kinds of W-W bond with lengths of 2.73 and 3.17 Å, respectively. As a contrast,  $Ir/\beta$ -W shows a significantly different coordination environment with three kinds of W-W bonds of 2.52, 2.82, and 3.09 Å, respectively. The corresponding coordination numbers are also listed in Table

S2 (Supporting Information). As a convincing complement to the FT-EXAFS, the wavelet transform (WT) of EXAFS was also conducted to demonstrate the local information (Figure 2g–i; Figure S19, Supporting Information). Obviously, W powder, Ir/ $\alpha$ -W, and Ir/ $\beta$ -W show apparent W–W bond, while WO $_3$  exhibits strong W–O bond, which agrees with the XANES spectra. The above analysis confirms that the variation in the coordination environment of W may have a significant effect on the electrocatalytic activity in Ir/ $\alpha$ -W and Ir/ $\beta$ -W.

To study the crystal phase engineering of tungsten on the HOR catalytic activity of  $Ir/\alpha$ -W and  $Ir/\beta$ -W, the HOR performance were explored by a rotating disk electrode (RDE) system in the hydrogen saturated 0.1 M KOH media. **Figure 3a**, Figures S20 and S21 (Supporting Information) show the polarization curves of as-prepared catalysts at 1600 rpm. It is evident that the anodic current density of  $Ir/\alpha$ -W surpasses that of  $Ir/\beta$ -W, Pt/C, Ir/C, and samples annealed under other conditions, indicating its better HOR activity. Meanwhile, pre-activation was employed to eliminate the effect of surface oxidation on HOR activity,  $I^{15}$

 $Ir/\alpha$ -W and  $Ir/\beta$ -W still exhibited significant different catalytic activity for HOR (Figure \$22, Supporting Information) (Note: all samples were preactivated at -0.05 V vs RHE for 0.5 h prior to the HOR test). Moreover, no current was detected in the N<sub>2</sub>saturated 0.1 м KOH solution, whereas the pronounced current response appeared in the H<sub>2</sub>-saturated 0.1 M KOH solution, proving the progression of hydrogen oxidation. (Figure S23, Supporting Information). Meanwhile, as shown in Figure S24 (Supporting Information), we compared the HOR performance of  $Ir/\alpha$ -W with different Ir contents, and the results showed that  $Ir/\alpha$ -W with 1.5% content of Ir exhibited the best practical application values. Furthermore, the exchange current density (j<sub>0</sub>) of the prepared samples obtained by Butler-Volmer fitting curve is shown in Figure 3b. The j<sub>0</sub> value of  $Ir/\alpha$ -W is 1.19 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, which is 1.56, 1.77, and 4.10 times higher than that of Pt/C,  $Ir/\beta$ -W and Ir/C, respectively. Additionally, the j<sub>0</sub> derived from the Micro-Polarization regions also match well with these values (Figures S25 and Table S3, Supporting Information). Figure 3c displays the LSV curves of  $Ir/\alpha$ -W obtained at various rotation speeds, where the limiting current density rises with the escalation of rotation speed due to enhanced mass transport. Besides, the diffusion-limited current density (id) for a RDE is described by the Koutecky–Levich equation as a function of rotation speed. The calculated slopes are 4.86 cm<sup>2</sup> mA<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1/2</sup> for Ir/ $\alpha$ -W, closely approaching the theoretical value (4.87 cm<sup>2</sup> mA<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1/2</sup> for the two-electron HOR) (Figure 3d). Furthermore, as shown in Figure 3e-g, Figure \$26 and Table \$4 (Supporting Information),  $Ir/\alpha$ -W shows the highest mass-normalized and ECSAnormalized activity among the as-prepared catalysts. Specifically, at 50 mV versus RHE,  $Ir/\alpha$ -W shows a mass-normalized activity of 768.13 mA mg<sup>-1</sup><sub>Ir</sub>, surpassing that of Ir/ $\beta$ -W, Pt/C, and Ir/C by 1.64, 5.98, and 17.19-fold, respectively. The ECSA-normalized activity of Ir/ $\alpha$ -W is 1.33 mA cm $^{-2}$ <sub>ECSA</sub>, which is 1.71 times, 6.50 times, and 5.38 times higher than that of  $Ir/\beta$ -W, Pt/C, and Ir/C, respectively. Simultaneously, the mass-normalized and ECSAnormalized exchange current densities  $(j_{0,m}, j_{0,s})$  and kinetic current densities (j $k_{,m}$ , j $_{k,s}$ ) were used to further evaluate the intrinsic activity of the prepared electrocatalysts. It can be noted that the  $j_{0,m}$  and  $j_{0,s}$  of  $Ir/\alpha$ -W are 518.3 mA  $mg^{-1}_{Ir}$  and 0.89 mA cm<sup>-2</sup><sub>FCSA</sub>, respectively, which are at the top level of recently reported Ir-based catalysts (Figure 3h; Table S5, Supporting Information). Meanwhile, the  $j_{k,m}$  and  $j_{k,s}$  of  $Ir/\alpha$ -W at 50 mV were as high as 2797 mA  $mg^{-1}_{\ \rm Ir}$  and 4.84 mA  $cm^{-2}_{\ ECSA}$  , respectively (Figure S27, Supporting Information). Considering that industrially produced H<sub>2</sub> may contain traces of CO, the resistance to CO poisoning was also evaluated. As shown in Figure S28 (Supporting Information), the acceptable currents attenuation of 15% in the presence of 1000 ppm CO indicates the significant CO resistance of  $Ir/\alpha$ -W catalysts. As stability is an important aspect in performance evaluation, we further tested the long-term durability of our  $Ir/\alpha$ -W catalyst. As shown in Figure 3i, the decline in activity after 2000 cycles of CV testing is negligible. Besides, the chronoamperometric test at 50 mV versus RHE shows only a slight decrease in activity over a long period of time (Figure S29, Supporting Information). Moreover, the XRD and XPS patterns of  $Ir/\alpha$ -W after stability testing are well maintained, further demonstrating the excellent stability of  $Ir/\alpha$ -W (Figures S30 and S31, Supporting Information). Additionally, the stability of  $Ir/\beta$ -W in HOR was also confirmed (Figures S32–S34, Support-

ing Information). It needs to be noted that the metastable  ${\rm Ir}/\beta$ -W phase did not exhibit superior HOR catalytic performance compared to the thermally stable  ${\rm Ir}/\alpha$ -W phase. However,  ${\rm Ir}/\beta$ -W represents the low-temperature phase, and in material synthesis, researchers often prioritize the synthesis of the low-temperature phase to investigate its properties. When the low-temperature W phase is synthesized, there is a risk that the high-temperature phase may not be adequately explored, potentially overlooking the phase with optimal catalytic performance for tungsten-based substrates. Furthermore, HOR was merely used a representative electrocatalytic reaction model, highlighting the significance of crystalline phase engineering in electrocatalytic processes. We believe that our work provides valuable insights into the controllable phase synthesis of tungsten and its use as a substrate for electrocatalysis.

Considering the crucial role of hydrogen bonding network in the kinetics of interfacial proton transfer reaction, in situ Raman measurements at various applied potentials were performed to confirm the hydrogen bonding network gap and to explore the origin of the favorable HOR activity on  $Ir/\alpha$ -W catalysts. As shown in Figure 4a,b, the in situ Raman spectrum exhibits a broad peak located  $\approx 3000 - 3800 \text{ cm}^{-1}$ , which can be attributed to the O-H stretching vibration of interfacial water.<sup>[16]</sup> Meanwhile, the broad peak can be distinguished into three parts by Gaussian fitting, where those located  $\approx$ 3200 cm<sup>-1</sup> are water molecules at the electrode surface (denoted as  $K^+$ - $H_2O$ ), those located  $\approx 3600$ cm<sup>-1</sup> are water molecules located in the gap region (denoted as gap- $H_2O$ ), and those located  $\approx 3400$  cm<sup>-1</sup> are water molecules above the gap region (denoted as above-gap-H2O).[17] Furthermore, in order to illustrate the difference in hydrogen bonding network connectivity between  $Ir/\alpha$ -W and  $Ir/\beta$ -W in detail, the potential-dependent proportions of the gap-H<sub>2</sub>O peaks in alkaline environments were analyzed. As shown in Figure 4c, the higher proportion of gap- $H_2O$  on  $Ir/\alpha$ -W compared to  $Ir/\beta$ -W, suggests an increased water concentration in the gap region and enhanced connectivity of the H-bonding network.[18] Therefore, we may conclude that the increased gap-H<sub>2</sub>O concentration and enhanced connectivity of the hydrogen bonding network at the  $Ir/\alpha$ -W electrode would accelerate the hydrogen transfer process and facilitate the Volmer step, leading to optimized alkaline HOR activity (Figure 4d,e).

As well known, the reaction mechanisms of alkaline HOR mainly include the Tafel-Volmer or Heyrovsky-Volmer mechanisms, and the possible reaction mechanism can be inferred by fitting Butler-Volmer Equation. [19] The charge transfer coefficients for both Ir/a-W and Ir/ $\beta$ -W in this work are close to 0.5, which is indicative of a Tafel-Volmer mechanism on both Ir/a-W and  $Ir/\beta$ -W electrodes. To further have an insight into the origin of the activity of Ir-W with different crystal phases, DFT simulations and experimental investigations were conducted to understand the reaction mechanism. As is well known, the adsorption strength of the intermediates H and OH involved in the rate-determining Volmer step is regarded as an indispensable descriptor for HOR activity in alkaline media. [20] Taking this into account, the intermediate adsorption behavior was first simulated by DFT calculations. As shown in **Figure 5a**,  $Ir/\alpha$ -W has a weaker HBE and a stronger OHBE relative to  $Ir/\beta$ -W. Furthermore, the crystal orbital Hamiltonian population (COHP) was performed to further characterize the interactions between

the active sites and the reaction intermediates. As shown in H-COHP in Figure [5b,](#page-7-0) the integrated COHP (ICOHP) value of Ir/- W (−0.10 eV) is lower that of Ir/-W, suggesting a weakening of H adsorption. Meanwhile the larger ICOHP of Ir/-W relative to Ir/-W in OH-COHP indicates enhanced OH adsorption (Figure [5c\)](#page-7-0). Moreover, we further conducted density of states calculations and electronic structure analyses (the electronic d states of transition metal) to back trace the origin of the difference in catalytic activity. The results indicate that the d-band center of the Ir active sites related to hydrogen binding in Ir/- W is located at −2.23 eV, while that of Ir/-W is at −1.92 eV (Figure [5d\)](#page-7-0). The downward shift of the d-band center of Ir/- W leads to the decreased HBE. Similarly, the d-band center of W on Ir/-W (-0.40 eV) is closer to the Fermi level than that on Ir/-W (−0.47 eV) (Figure [5e\)](#page-7-0), thus enhancing the OHBE. Besides, a sequence of experiments was conducted to further confirm the HBE and OHBE of the catalysts. As one of the crucial methods for assessing the strength of HBE, hydrogen temperature programmed desorption (H2-TPD) was first performed.[\[21\]](#page-8-0) As illustrated in Figure [5f,](#page-7-0) the peak temperature of Ir/-W is situated at 101 °C, which is more negative than the peak at 114 °C of Ir/-W, implying its weaker HBE. In addition, the desorption of underpotential deposited hydrogen (Hupd) was also performed as a powerful tool to further assess the HBE (Figure [5g\)](#page-7-0).[\[22\]](#page-8-0) The Hupd peak of Ir/-W decreased by 0.02 V compared to that of Ir/- W, indicating a decrease in the HBE on Ir/-W. Moreover, CO dissolution curves and zeta potential experiments, as convincing tools, were conducted to gain more insights into the OHBE.[\[23\]](#page-8-0) As can be seen from Figure [5h,](#page-7-0) the CO oxidation peak of Ir/-W occurs at 0.85 V versus RHE, showing a negative shift of 0.02 V in comparison to Ir/-W (0.87 V vs RHE). This shift proves that Ir/-W exhibits a stronger OHad binding, considering that the anodic current for CO oxidation can only be activated by active OHad. Similarly, zeta potential experiments further indicate that Ir/-W shows stronger OHBE, with a fact that Ir/-W exhibits more negative charge (Figure S35, Supporting Information).[\[24\]](#page-8-0) Moreover, we further investigate the Gibbs free energies diagrams of the alkaline HOR reaction pathways on Ir/-W and Ir/-W in Figure [5i](#page-7-0) and Figure S36 (Supporting Information). From a thermodynamic standpoint, the rate-determining step (RDS) of HOR on Ir/-W and Ir/-W catalysts is the H2O\* formation step. Specifically, the energy barrier of the Ir/-W catalyst (0.46 eV) is significantly smaller than that of Ir/-W (0.62 eV), indicating tha Ir/-W catalyst is more favorable for the HOR process.

The Ir/-W exhibits an outstanding j0,m of 518.3 A g<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> Ir, which is ≈1.8 and 16.4 times higher compared to Ir/-W and Ir/C, respectively, and is among the top reported iridium-based catalysts. In-depth mechanistic studies indicate that the Ir/-W with A2-type structure has enhanced H-bond network connectivity, as well as optimized HBE and OHBE, which promotes enhanced HOR activity. This work not only explores phase engineering of new metal materials, but also inspires more scientific interest focusing on phase engineering strategies for the design of advanced electrocatalysts.

**The exploitation of ingenious strategies to improve the activity and stability of ruthenium (Ru) is crucial for the advancement of Ru-based electrocatalysts. Vacancy engineering is a typical strategy for modulating the catalytic activity of electrocatalysts. However, creating vacancies directly into pure metallic Ru is difficult because of the extremely stringent conditions required and will result in instability because the integrity of the crystal structure is destroyed. In response, a compromise tactic by introducing vacancies in a Ru composite structure is proposed, and vacancy-rich carbon dots coupled with Ru (Ru@CDs) are elaborately constructed. Specifically, the vacancy-rich carbon dots (CDs) serve as an excellent platform for anchoring and trapping Ru nanoparticles, thus restraining their agglomeration and growth. As expected, Ru@CDs exhibited excellent catalytic performance with a low overpotential of 30 mV at 10 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2 in 1 m KOH, a small Tafel slope of 22 mV decade<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> , and robust stability even after 10 000 cycles. The low overpotential is comparable to those of most previously reported Ru-based electrocatalysts. Additionally, spectroscopic characterizations and theoretical calculations demonstrate that the rich vacancies and the electron interactions between Ru and CDs synergistically lower the intermediate energy barrier and thereby maximize the activity of the Ru@CDs electrocatalyst.**

## **1. Introduction**

The exploitation of highly active and inexpensive electrocatalysts for hydrogen generation through water electrolysis plays an important role in future clean-energy technologies.[1] Ruthenium (Ru), which has a low cost (about 5% of Pt), is considered as an ideal alternative to platinum (Pt) owing to their similar hydrogen bond strengths.[2] However, its activity and durability are still not satisfactory because of the tendency of Ru to aggregate due to its high cohesive energy, which degrades its performance.[3] Therefore, appropriate means to overcome this problem are urgently required.

Vacancy engineering is an excellent strategy beyond the traditional morphology and size modifications for modulating the physicochemical and electronic properties of nanomaterials to improve their electrocatalytic activity.[4] Specifically, vacancies facilitate to improve the interfacial charge transfer, favor the adsorption/desorption of reactive species on the electrocatalyst surface, optimize the reaction kinetics, and thereby accelerate the hydrogen evolution.[5] Based on this, by the rational designing and engineering of

the vacancies in nanomaterials, substantial enhancement of the electrocatalytic activity can be attained.[6] Most of the existing researches have focused on the creation of non-metallic vacancies such as C, N, and O vacancies in metallic compounds. However, the introduction of vacancies directly into pure metal is rarely reported because of the high formation energy of metal vacancies and the extremely stringent conditions required. In addition, the creation of vacancies would decrease the stability of Ru because the integrity of the crystal structure is destroyed.[7] Therefore, it could be a feasible strategy to get a compromise by introducing vacancies in the composite structure of Ru.

Carbon dots (CDs) as graphene derivatives with sizes smaller than 10 nm, are a focus of research because of their good biocompatibility, high stability, and fluorescent characteristics.[8] However, the application of CDs in electrocatalysis is still in its infancy. CDs, which possess accessible intrinsic vacancies, rapid electrontransfer properties, high stability, and large surface area are ideal candidates for combination with Ru.[9] Specifically, the abundant

vacancies and functional groups (such as NH2, COOH, OH) in CDs would provide favorable binding sites for the coordination stabilization of metal-CDs composites.[10] Furthermore, CDs can form 2D graphene-like nanosheets after high-temperature treatment through dehydration and condensation reactions between the surface functional groups.[11] In view of these properties, the association of CDs with Ru to form vacancy-rich Ru@CDs structures can provide a potential route for engineering of Ru-based hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalysts.

Hence, Ru@CDs electrocatalyst with CDs as the carrier was fabricated through a simple hydrothermal and pyrolysis process. The vacancy-rich CDs serve as an excellent platform for anchoring and trapping Ru nanoparticles, thus restraining their aggregation and growth. The obtained Ru@CDs exhibited excellent catalytic performance with a low overpotential (30 mV at 10 mA cm−<sup>2</sup> in 1 m KOH) and a small Tafel slope of 22 mV decade−<sup>1</sup> , which are both comparable to that of Pt/C catalyst. Spectroscopy data and density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that the rich vacancies and strong electron interactions between Ru and the CDs synergistically reduce the intermediate energy barrier and thereby maximize the activity of the Ru@CDs electrocatalyst. The preparation and study of vacancy-rich electrocatalysts will provide fundamental insights for the design of advanced catalysts.

## **2. Results and Discussion**

#### **2.1. Synthesis and Characterizations of Catalyst**

### *2.1.1. Synthesis of CDs and Ru@CDs*

Ru@CDs were synthesized by a simple two-step procedure (see material synthesis and methods for the detailed process) and the schematic diagram is demonstrated in **Figure 1**. First, CDs were obtained by a facile hydrothermal process and the thermal reduction will endow CDs with abundant vacancies and multiple functional groups, which provides a potential platform for trapping and coordinating with Ru ions to form the stable Ru3+- CDs complex (Figure 1a). Then, through a secondary hydrothermal and pyrolysis treatment, super fine Ru nanoparticles were successfully anchored on the CDs, resulting in the formation of Ru@CDs (Figure 1b).

#### *2.1.2. Characterizations of CDs*

The characteristics of pristine CDs were investigated. As shown in **Figure 2**a, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was conducted to observe the microstructure of the CDs. Obviously, the CDs were well dispersed, with the average diameter of ≈5 nm (Figure 2b). Additionally, lattice fringes could be clearly observed in the high-magnification TEM images. The lattice spacing of 0.32 nm corresponds to the (002) facet of graphene (Figure 2c).[12] The optical properties of the CDs were determined from the UV–vis absorption and photoluminescence spectra. As shown in Figure 2d, the UV–vis spectrum of the CDs has an absorption peak between 250–300 nm, which was attributed to the *π*–*π*\* transition of CC bonds. In addition, bright blue luminescence can be distinctly observed under UV irradiation at 365 nm (inset of Figure 2e). The maximum photoluminescence excitation (light blue curve) and emission wavelengths (dark blue curve) of the CDs were 305 and 340 nm, respectively (Figure 2e). The TEM data and spectroscopy data demonstrated that the CDs were successfully synthesized. Meanwhile, the X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) pattern shows a broad peak at ≈26°, which can be attributed to the (002) plane reflection of graphene (Figure 2f).[13] This result is consistent

well with the TEM data. The results of the Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy performed to investigate the functional groups of the CDs are shown in Figure 2g and Table S1, Supporting Information. Obviously, the series of characteristic peaks, such as NH and CO appeared and it indicated that abundant functional groups existed on the surface of the obtained CDs. These functional groups promote the anchoring of Ru nanoparticles. Then X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out to study the chemical components of the CDs. The survey spectrum confirmed that the CDs were composed of C, N, and O (Figure 2h). Additionally, the highresolution C, N, and O 1s spectra (Figure S1a–c, Supporting Information) further prove that abundant functional groups were successfully formed on the surface of the CDs. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra was carried out to characterize the electronic structure of the obtained CDs (Figure 2i). The CDs exhibited a strong EPR signal with *g* = 2.0028, which

manifested that abundant carbon vacancies were formed after the hydrothermal treatment.[14] The emergence of these vacancies favors the trapping of Ru nanoparticles, prevents their aggregation, and ultimately results in their uniform loading on the surface of the CDs. In summary, the spectroscopy and morphology characterizations show that vacancy-rich CDs with multi-functional groups were successfully synthesized.

#### *2.1.3. Characterization of Ru@CDs*

Subsequently, the vacancy-rich CDs with multi-functional groups were used as carriers to synthesize Ru@CDs through a typical hydrothermal and pyrolysis process. As revealed in **Figure 3**a, in addition to the broad dominant graphite C peak at about 26°, the other indicated peaks match well with Ru (PDF#89-3942), which suggests the successful anchoring of www.advancedsciencenews.com

Ru on the CDs. Then, the elemental compositions and surface chemical states were investigated by XPS. The survey spectrum in Figure 3b and the high-resolution C 1s, O 1s, N 1s, Ru 3p, and Ru 3d XPS spectra (Figures S2 and S3, Supporting Information) confirm the presence of C, N, O, and Ru, evidencing the coexistence of Ru and CDs. In addition, the FT-IR spectrum peaks (Figure 3c) correspond to the stretching vibration of -OH (3433 cm<sup>-1</sup>), the stretching vibration of C=C in benzene rings (1629 cm<sup>-1</sup>), the stretching vibrations of C-N (1391 cm<sup>-1</sup>), and C-O (1111 cm<sup>-1</sup>).<sup>[15]</sup> This result was consistent with the XPS data, which demonstrated that Ru@CDs inherited the surface oxygenic and nitrogenous functional groups from the CDs. The morphology of Ru@CDs was observed through TEM. As shown in Figure 3d and Figure S4, Supporting Information, the Ru nanoparticles are uniformly distributed on the carbon nanosheets derived from the CDs. Furthermore, the highresolution TEM image (HRTEM) in Figure 3e clearly displays that Ru@CDs are composed of two parts. The crystalline lattice fringes of 0.213 and 0.233 nm are matched to the (002) and (100) planes of Ru, and the spacing of 0.333 nm attributes to the (002) plane of graphite C. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) further confirms the coexistence of Ru and CDs, which are consistent with the HRTEM results (Figure 3f). Elemental mapping (Figure 3g) by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) further confirms the presence of C, N, O, and Ru, and the uniform distribution of these elements in the formed Ru@CDs.

#### 2.2. Hydrogen Evolution Reaction Performance of Ru@CDs

The electrocatalytic HER activity of Ru@CDs in 1.0  $\,\mathrm{m}$  KOH solution was measured using a conventional three-electrode system. All the measurements were corrected for iR loss. As shown in Figure 4a,b, the Ru@CDs obtained at 400  $\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  exhibit the lowest overpotential to attain the current density of 10  $\,\mathrm{mA}$  cm $^{-2}$  and the smallest Tafel slope. These results indicate that 400  $\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  is the optimal pyrolysis temperature for the preparation of Ru@CDs. The HER performance of Ru@CDs, CDs-400, Ru powder, and

20% commercial Pt/C were also investigated and the results are displayed in Figure 4c. Obviously, the Ru@CDs present a very low overpotential (η) of 30 mV in attaining the current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, which is much lower than those of Ru powder (152 mV) and CDs-400 (612 mV) with the same catalyst loadings (the zigzag fluctuations represent the generation of a large amount of hydrogen and the bursting of hydrogen bubbles). Moreover, the overpotential of Ru@CDs was comparable to that of commercial 20% Pt/C (24 mV). To elucidate the catalytic kinetics of Ru@CDs, the Tafel plots were fitted from the corresponding linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves, and the results were shown in Figure 4d. The calculated Tafel slope of Ru@CDs is 22 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>, which is much smaller than those of 20% Pt/C (24 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>), Ru powder (97 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>), and CDs-400 (215 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>), attesting the more favorable kinetics of Ru@CDs.

The low overpotential and small Tafel slope underline the excellent hydrogen evolution activity of Ru@CDs, which rivals those of the most state-of-the-art Ru-based HER catalysts reported in recent studies (Figure 4e).<sup>[1a,16]</sup> In addition, the exchange current density was also calculated to evaluate the performance of the catalysts. As exhibited in Figure 4f, Ru@CDs possess the highest exchange current density, which further confirms the highest catalytic activity of Ru@CDs in all the samples. Moreover, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was conducted to study the interfacial electron transfer of the resultant electrocatalysts, and the results are displayed in Figure 4g. Apparently, Ru@CDs show the smallest charge transfer resistance compared to Ru powder and CDs-400, which suggests that Ru@CDs have the best electron transfer kinetics and thus enhanced electrocatalytic activity. In addition, to further explore the improved HER

performances of Ru@CDs in comparison to that of Ru powder and CDs, their electrochemically active surface areas (ECSA) were estimated from the electrochemical double-layer capacitance (*C*dl) by collecting cyclic voltammograms in a non-Faradaic region of 0.16–0.26 V vs RHE. As shown in Figure 4h and Figure S5, Supporting Information, Ru@CDs exhibit the highest Cdl values, which demonstrates the highly exposed active sites and higher catalytic activity of Ru@CDs. The long-term durability is also an important criterion for evaluating the performance of a catalyst. The stability of Ru@CDs was estimated by applying continuous cyclic voltammetry (CV) cycles with a scan rate of 100 mV s<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> . After 10 000 CV cycles, the polarization curve shows little significant changes with the initial one (Figure 4i), indicating the stable performance of Ru@CDs in 1.0 m KOH. To further verify the excellent HER activity of Ru@CDs, an overall water splitting measurement was conducted to investigate the full-cell performance for practical applications. The overall water splitting measurement was performed using a two-electrode system in 1.0 m KOH medium with RuO2 and Ru@CDs deposited on the glassy carbon electrode (GCE) as the anode and cathode, respectively. As shown in Figure S6, Supporting Information, Ru@CDs achieve optimal performance, and a cell voltage of 1.55 V is needed to generate a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> , which is comparable to that of 20% Pt/C||RuO2 electrode systems (1.53 V). The aforementioned experimental results demonstrate that Ru@CDs catalyst is a highly efficient Ru-based catalyst, and has considerable potential in exploitation and development of highly efficient CDs-based Pt-free HER catalysts.

#### 2.3. Vacancy and Strong Electron Coupling of Ru and CDs

As demonstrated, the fabricated Ru@CDs exhibited remarkable HER activity. Thus, EPR and XPS spectra were performed to explore the reasons for the excellent performance. As shown in Figure 5a, Ru@CDs exhibit strong EPR signal, which suggests that they inherit the rich vacancies of the CDs. As mentioned earlier, CDs have abundant intrinsic vacancies, and during the process of anchoring Ru to the CDs, more vacancies may be generated by the pyrolysis treatment. Accordingly, the existence of these vacancies will facilitate to the enhancement of the HER catalytic activity. Figure 5b,c clearly exhibits the Ru 3p and 3d XPS spectra of Ru@ CDs and Ru powder. Compared with that in Ru powder, the 3p<sub>3/2</sub> state and 3d<sub>5/2</sub> peak of Ru in Ru@CDs are both shifted to higher binding energies. This suggests that electronic interactions occur between Ru and the CDs after their combination. In addition, the peaks of N 1s and O 1s in Ru@CDs are also shifted relative to pristine CDs-400, further confirming the transfer of electrons from Ru to O and N (Figure 5d,e). Figure 5f detailedly displays the vacancy and electron transfer path from Ru to CDs in Ru@CDs. In a word, abundant vacancies and the strong electron interaction synergistically enhanced the electrocatalytic activities of Ru@CDs.

#### 2.4. Density Functional Theory Calculations

For HER process in alkaline media, regulating the water dissociation and Gibbs free energy of hydrogen adsorption ( $\Delta G_{H^{\pm}}$ ) in the catalyst is vital for acquiring competent HER catalytic performance. To gain further insight into the mechanism of the prominent HER activity in Ru@CDs, DFT calculations were performed, and the results are presented in **Figure 6**. Accordingly, Figures 6a and 6b present the geometry configurations and the optimum adsorption models of the CDs and Ru@CDs. Correspondingly, the relevant HER reaction pathways for Ru clusters (Ru), CDs without vacancies (w-CDs), and Ru@CDs without

vacancies (w-Ru@CDs) are shown in Figures S7-S10, Supporting Information. The optimized free energy diagrams for alkaline HER were calculated, and the corresponding Gibbs free energies are summarized in Table S2, Supporting Information. As revealed in Figure 6c, the calculated energy barriers for H<sub>2</sub>O dissociation in Ru, w-CDs, CDs, w-Ru@CDs, and Ru@CDs are 0.53, 2.95, 0.42, 0.41, and 0.45 eV, respectively. Apparently, the water dissociation energy of CDs decreases significantly from 2.95 to 0.42 eV due to the formation of surface vacancies. The decrease indicates that the introduction of vacancies is beneficial to lower the energy barriers, improves the reaction kinetics, and ultimately enhances the catalytic activity. Furthermore, the hydrogen adsorption free energy ( $\Delta G_{H^*}$ ) is also an important index for evaluating the performance of a specific catalyst. Generally, the closer  $\Delta G_{H^*}$  is to zero, the more favorable it is to balance the adsorption and desorption of H\*, and the higher is the catalytic activity. [17] As revealed in Figure 6d, the calculated  $\Delta G_{H^*}$ of Ru@CDs is closer to 0 eV than those of the other models, demonstrating that Ru@CDs are the most favorable model for hydrogen evolution, which is consistent with the electrochemical results. In summary, the DFT calculations exhibit that the creation of vacancies greatly promotes the water dissociation, and the formation of Ru@CDs regulates the adsorption and desorption of hydrogen. Thus, the abundant vacancies and the strong electronic interactions between Ru and the CDs synergistically accelerate the improvement of HER activity.

#### 2.5. HER Mechanism of Ru@CDs

Figure 7 manifests the schematic diagram for the hydrogen evolution process over Ru@CDs. Specifically, vacancy-rich CDs

serve as an excellent platform for anchoring and trapping Ru nanoparticles, thus availably restrain their agglomeration and growth. Meanwhile, the resulting abundant vacancies in Ru@ CDs advantageously reduce the dissociation energy of water and effectively improve the reaction kinetics. In addition, the strong electron coupling of Ru and CDs also facilitates to regulate the adsorption and desorption of H\*. Thus, the whole process begins with the dissociation of the absorbed water on the surface of Ru@CDs to form a transitional intermediate H\*. The intermediate H\* will combine with each other to generate H<sub>2</sub>. This completes the whole process for the electrolysis of water to produce hydrogen.

#### 3. Conclusion

In summary, by associating Ru with vacancy-rich CDs, Ru@ CDs with abundant vacancies were successfully obtained. The confinement of CDs prevents the aggregation of Ru and improves its stability. As expected, Ru@CDs exhibited a significantly low overpotential at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> (30 mV in 1.0 м KOH) as well as the small Tafel slope of 22 mV decade<sup>-1</sup>, and the HER activity was comparable to that of 20% Pt/C under alkaline conditions. Additionally, the spectrum characterization and DFT calculations demonstrated that the abundant vacancies and the strong electron interactions facilitated to promote the dissociation of water and regulated the adsorption and desorption of hydrogen, and thus synergistically boosted the enhancement of the HER activity. The reported Ru@CDs catalyst enriches the libraries of Ru-based catalysts and the strategy of this vacancyengineering provides ideas for the subsequent design of novel highly efficient catalysts.

## 4. Experimental Section

Synthesis of Vacancy-Rich Carbon Dots (CDs): The CDs were synthesized as follows: 3 g of phenol was dissolved in a mixed solution of 30 mL DMF and 3 mL H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> by magnetic stirring. The solution was then transferred to a poly (tetrafluoroethylene) (Teflon)-lined autoclave (50 mL) and maintained at 200 °C for 2 h. After natural cooling, the obtained solution was filtered through a membrane (0.22  $\mu m$ ) to remove insoluble impurities. Subsequently, the solution was transferred into dialysis bags (molecular weight cutoff 500 D) for purification of the CDs, and the final product was freeze-dried for 24 h to obtain CDs powder.

Preparation of Ru@CDs: 120 mg of RuCl $_3$ ·3 $H_2$ O was dissolved in 10 mL of the CD solution (60 mg mL<sup>-1</sup>) to obtain a homogeneous solution. The obtained black solution was then transferred to a 25 mL Teflon-lined autoclave and heated at 200 °C for 8 h. After natural cooling and centrifugation at 10 000 rpm for 15 min, the precipitate was collected, washed several times with deionized water and ethanol, and dried overnight under vacuum at 40 °C. The obtained powder was then calcined at 300, 400, 500, and 600 °C under an argon atmosphere for 2 h at the heating rate of 5 °C min<sup>-1</sup>, and the products were labeled as Ru@ CDs-300, Ru@CDs-400, Ru@CDs-500, and Ru@CDs-600, respectively. Unless otherwise stated, the Ru@CDs in the text refers to Ru@CDs-400. The CDs used for comparison were also pyrolyzed at 400 °C and denoted as CDs-400

Material Characterization: UV-vis absorption spectra were obtained using a Shimadzu UV-3101 PC spectrophotometer. The fluorescence spectra were recorded using a HITACHI F-7000 fluorescence spectrophotometer. TEM images of pristine CDs and Ru@CDs were collected using an FEI Tecnai G2 F20 TEM. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained using an Ultima IV multipurpose X-ray diffractometer with a Cu radiation source (K $\alpha$ ,  $\lambda$  = 0.15406 nm). FT-IR spectra were obtained using a Nicolet IS5 spectrometer. XPS characterization was performed using a Thermo Scientific ESCALAB 250Xi spectrometer with C1s (binding energy of 284.6 eV) as a reference. EPR spectra were recorded using a Bruker A300 EPR spectrometer.

Electrochemical Measurements: All electrochemical measurements were performed in 1.0 m KOH using a standard three-electrode system (CHI660E, Shanghai Chenhua, China) at 25 °C with a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the reference electrode, a graphite rod as the counter electrode, and a commercial GCE (3 mm diameter) as the working electrode. Generally, 10 mg of the catalyst was dispersed in 0.1% Nafion solution and sonicated for 30 min. Then, 10  $\mu L$  of prepared homogeneous ink was dropped on the surface of the GCE with a micropipette and left to dry at room temperature. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was performed at the scan rate of 5 mV s<sup>-1</sup>, and the measurements were corrected with iR compensation (95%). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed at the potential of -0.93~V at the frequencies of  $0.1-10^5~Hz$  and amplitude of 5 mV. Cyclic voltammograms (CV) were performed in the 0.16-0.26 V vs RHE range with different scan rates (20, 40, 60, 80, 100, and 120 mV s<sup>-1</sup>) in 1.0 M KOH for the double-layer capacitance ( $C_{\rm dl}$ ) measurements. Long-term stability tests were carried out using cyclic voltammograms (CVs) at the scan rate of 100 mV s<sup>-1</sup>.All potentials were calibrated with an RHE using  $E_{\rm RHE}=E_{\rm Hg/HgO}+0.0591~{\rm pH}+0.098.$ 

DFT Computation Details: All the spin-polarized computations were performed using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP).[18] The ion-electron interactions were described using the projector augmented wave method. [19] The generalized gradient approximation in the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) form and the cut-off energy of 400 eV for the planewave basis set were adopted. [20] The convergence criteria for the residual force and energy during the structure relaxation were set to 0.03 eV Å<sup>-1</sup> and 10<sup>-5</sup> eV, respectively. The minimum energy pathway was determined using the climbing nudged elastic band method. [21] A 4  $\times$  4 graphene supercell with one N atom dopant, a Ru14 cluster (the structure was obtained from the reference),[22] and a Ru<sub>14</sub> cluster deposited on a  $6 \times 6$  graphene supercell with one N atom dopant were used as models to simulate N-doped carbon dots, Ru clusters, and N-doped carbon dotsupported Ru clusters, respectively. The corresponding Brillouin zones

were sampled using  $4 \times 4 \times 1$ ,  $1 \times 1 \times 1$ , and  $3 \times 3 \times 1$  Monkhorst-Pack k-point grids, respectively. A vacuum space exceeding 15 Å was employed to avoid interactions between two periodic units.

The free energy for hydrogen adsorption  $(\Delta G_H)^{[23]}$  was computed as:

$$\Delta G_{H} = \Delta E_{H} + \Delta E_{ZPF} - T\Delta S_{H} \tag{1}$$

where  $\Delta E_{H}$ ,  $\Delta E_{7PF}$ , and  $\Delta S_{H}$  are the adsorption energy of H, the zeropoint energy difference, and the entropy difference between the adsorbed and gas phases, respectively.

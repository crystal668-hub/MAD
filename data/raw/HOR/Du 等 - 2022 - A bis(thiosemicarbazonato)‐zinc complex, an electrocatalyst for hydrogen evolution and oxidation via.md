## Abstract

Based on that hydrogen energy is widely used in fuel cells, the design and research of new catalysts for both hydrogen evolution reactions (HERs) and hydrogen oxidation reactions (HORs) are becoming increasingly important. A new catalyst for both hydrogen evolution and oxidation, based on a zinc complex, [Zn-ATSE]2, is designed and provided by the reaction of Zn (CH3CO2)2 with diacetyl-2-(4-N-ethyl-3-thiosemicarbazone)-3-(4-N-amino-3-thiosemicarbazone) (H2ATSE) in our group. Electrochemical investigations show that [Zn-ATSE]2 can electro-catalyze hydrogen evolution from acetic acid with a turnover frequency (TOF) of 64 mol H2 mol catalyst<sup>1</sup> h<sup>1</sup> under an overpotential of 914.6 mV. Moreover, [Zn-ATSE]2 also can electro-catalyze hydrogen oxidation with a TOF of 13.52 s<sup>1</sup> . The results can be attributed to the hydrazine group of [Zn-ATSE]2 that can form a ligand-based radical species. Possible electrocatalytic cycles for H2 production and oxidation by [Zn-ATSE]2 are afforded. We hope these findings can afford a new method for the design of electrocatalysts for both H2 evolution and H2 oxidation.

## 1 | INTRODUCTION

Considering that hydrogen is an ideal energy, because of its numerous advantages, such as recyclability and pollution-free use, interest in efficient generation of hydrogen energy has increased dramatically, and lots of methods for hydrogen evolution have been developed.[1] Based on that the use of H2 in fuel cells is an attractive strategy,[2–5] the storage of hydrogen energy is becoming increasingly important. It is apparent that as molecular catalysts, hydrogenase enzymes based on iron and nickel complexes can efficiently catalyze both the production and the oxidation of hydrogen,[6] but the stability is often limited outside of their native environment.[6,7] To mimic the behavior of this natural process, several groups, including ours, have focused the interests on the developments of abundant metal-based catalysts,[8] and several transition metals complexes[9–15] have been designed and developed as catalysts for H2 generation.

In other hand, the notable progress also has been made in the developments for hydrogen oxidation catalysts with transition metal complexes.[16–20] However, there have been few complexes reported in the literature that can act efficiently as both hydrogen oxidation catalysts (HOCs) and hydrogen evolution catalysts (HECs).<sup>[5,21]</sup> To this end, we focus our interests on the design of new complexes that catalyze the reaction in both directions (hydrogen evolution and oxidation). A tetradentate ligand, diacetyl-2-(4-N-ethyl-3-thiosemicarbazone)-3-(4-*N*-amino-3-thiosemicarbazone) (H<sub>2</sub>ATSE), has been designed and synthesized in our lab. In the presence of triethylamine (Et<sub>3</sub>N), the reaction of H<sub>2</sub>ATSE and Zn (CH<sub>3</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub> affords a zinc complex, [Zn-ATSE]2, a new catalyst for both hydrogen generation and hydrogen oxidation. Reported here are the synthesis and characterization of the zinc complex, [Zn-ATSE]<sub>2</sub>, and its electro-catalytic properties for hydrogen evolution and oxidation thereof.

### 2 | EXPERIMENTAL SECTIONS

### 2.1 | Physical measurements

A Perkin-Elmer analyzer model 240 was used to do elemental analyses for C, H, and N. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) analysis was carried out by using a Bruker AV-500 instrument. A Hitachi U-3010 spectrophotometer was used to measure UV-Vis spectra of the samples. Electrospray mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) experiment was performed in the negative ion mode on an AB Sciex API 3200 spectrometer. Measurement for the crystalline diffraction patterns of the zinc complex was carried out by using Bruker D8 Advance powder X-ray diffraction. The energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) measurements were carried out with a Shimadzu EPMA-1600 Electron Probe X-ray micro analyzer. Electron spin resonance (ESR) spectrum of [Zn-ATSE]2 was taken on a Bruker Elexsys II E500 ESR spectrometer. Electrochemical measurements and analysis were conducted by using a CHI-660E electrochemical analyzer using a three-electrode cell in which a glassy carbon electrode (1 mm in diameter) is the working electrode, a saturated Ag/AgNO3 or Ag/AgCl electrode is the reference electrode, and a platinum wire is the auxiliary electrode. For organic media, 0.10-M [(n-Bu)<sub>4</sub>N|ClO<sub>4</sub> was selected as a supporting electrolyte. Controlled-potential electrolysis (CPE) in organic media was carried out by using an airtight glass double compartment cell separated by a glass frit. The working compartment was fitted with a glassy carbon plate and an Ag/AgNO3 reference electrode. The auxiliary compartment was fitted with a Pt gauze electrode. The working compartment was filled with acetic acid in a 0.10-M [( $n\text{-Bu}_4\text{N}$ )]ClO<sub>4</sub> CH<sub>3</sub>CN solution (50 ml), whereas the auxiliary compartment was filled with 35 ml of 0.10-M [( $n\text{-Bu}_4\text{N}$ )]ClO<sub>4</sub> CH<sub>3</sub>CN solution, resulting in equal solution levels in both compartments. In aqueous media, the working compartment was fitted with a glassy carbon plate and an Ag/AgCl reference electrode and filled with 50 ml of 0.10-M buffer solution. The auxiliary compartment was fitted with a Pt gauze electrode and filled with 35-ml buffer solution. After adding H<sub>2</sub>ATSE or [Zn-ATSE]<sub>2</sub>, both compartments were bubbled for 1.5 h with nitrogen, and cyclic voltammograms (CVs) were recorded as controls. After electrolysis, a 0.5-ml aliquot of the headspace was taken and replaced with 0.5 ml of CH<sub>4</sub>, and the headspace sample was injected into the gas chromatograph (GC). A series of gas chromatograph experiments and analysis were conducted by using an Agilent Technologies 7890A gas chromatography instrument.

### 2.2 | Synthesis of H<sub>2</sub>ATSE

**A**: A 5.0-mmol 4-ethyl-3-thiosemicarbazide was added to 100 ml of deionized water and vigorously stirred at  $0^{\circ}$ C. Then, five drops of concentrated HCl were added followed by the rapid addition of 1.2 equiv of 2,3-butadione from a syringe. After 1 h, the precipitate was collected by filtration and washed thoroughly with water (3 × 20 ml) in good yield ( $\sim$ 86%).

**B**: The above product (5.0 mmol) was added to a stirred suspension of 4-ethyl-3-thiosemicarbazide (5.0 mmol) in 75 ml of ethanol. After stirring for 30 min, five drops of a 10% HCl acid (aq) was added and stirred overnight at 50°C, a white precipitate was formed. The mixture was allowed to cool, and solid was collected by filtration and washed with ethanol (2 × 20 ml) and diethyl ether in good yield ( $\sim$ 89%). <sup>1</sup>H NMR (400 MHz, DMSO- $d_6$ ) 10.14 (1H), 8.41 (1H), 3.60 (2H), 2.21 (6H), 1.14 (3H). <sup>13</sup>C NMR (400 MHz, DMSO- $d_6$ ) 177.89, 148.40, 39.04, 14.83, 12.15.

## 2.3 | Synthesis of the [Zn-ATSE]<sub>2</sub>

o a solution of 0.30-g (1.0 mmol) ligand,  $H_2ATSE$ , in 20-ml N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), 0.22 g (1.0 mmol) Zn  $(CH_3CO_2)_2 \cdot 2H_2O$  in 10 ml deionized water was added with stirring. The solution was allowed to slowly evaporate, affording deep green crystals. The product was isolated by filtration, washed with deionized water, and dried in vacuo (0.11 g, 30%). Elemental analysis for C, H, and N found (calcd) for  $C_{20}H_{36}N_{12}S_4Zn_2$ : C, 34.53 (34.11); H, 5.10 (5.12); N, 23.8 (23.88).

### 3 | RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

## 3.1 | Characterization for the zinc complex, [Zn-ATSE]<sub>2</sub>

 $H_2ATSE$  was obtained by the reaction of 4-ethyl-3-thiosemicarbazide and 2,3-butadione (Figures S1 and S2). Zn  $(CH_3CO_2)_2$  reacts with  $H_2ATSE$  to afford a new binuclear zinc complex,  $[Zn-ATSE]_2$  (Scheme 1), which is consistent with the X-ray analysis in solid state.

Using single crystal X-ray diffraction to determinate structure of  $[Zn-ATSE]_2$ , with the results shown in Figure 1 and Table 1, the structure in solid of  $[Zn-ATSE]_2$  was found to be a sulfur-bridged dimer (Figure 1). The molecular structure of  $[Zn-ATSE]_2$  is formed by two  $ATSE^{2-}$  molecules and two zinc atoms. Each zinc is five-coordinated by two nitrogen atoms and three sulfur atoms. The Zn(1)–S(1)–Zn(1)# angle in the zinc complex is 83.90°. The Zn–S1 and Zn–S1# bond distances are almost symmetric at 2.4821(13) and 2.4215(12) Å, respectively.

To check the purity of [Zn-ATSE]<sub>2</sub>, its powder X-ray diffraction pattern was measured at room temperature.

From Figure S3, the experimental peak positions are consistent with the simulated ones, which indicates a good purity of [Zn-ATSE]<sub>2</sub>.

# 3.2 | Electrochemical behavior of [Zn-ATSE]<sub>2</sub>

Encouraged by that Cu (II) complex of diacetyl-bis(*N*-4-methyl-3-thiosemicarbazonato) has ligand-assisted metal-centered reactivity for hydrogen evolution,<sup>[22]</sup> we tried to investigate catalytic behaviors for hydrogen production of [Zn-ATSE]<sub>2</sub>.

We first measured CVs of [Zn-ATSE]<sub>2</sub> (Figure 2a), [(n-Bu)<sub>4</sub>N]ClO<sub>4</sub> (Figure S4), H<sub>2</sub>ATSE (Figure S5), and Zn (CH<sub>3</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub> (Figure S6) in CH<sub>3</sub>CN. Considering that the ligand, H<sub>2</sub>ATSE, displayed one quasi-reversible wave at 0.95 V versus Ag/AgNO<sub>3</sub> (Figure S5), [Zn-ATSE]<sub>2</sub> exhibited two irreversible waves at 0.51 and -1.90 V versus Ag/AgNO<sub>3</sub>, which can be assigned to the Zn<sup>III/II</sup> and Zn<sup>II/I</sup> couples, respectively (Figure 2a). Moreover, according to Figure S7a,b, the linear fitting plot of  $i_d$  versus  $\nu^{1/2}$  for [Zn-ATSE]<sub>2</sub> indicates that the reduction is in a diffusion-controlled regime. [23]

## 3.3 | Electrocatalytic hydrogen generation from acetic acid by [Zn-ATSE]<sub>2</sub> in CH<sub>3</sub>CN

Considering that iron hydrogenase can catalyze hydrogen evolution via a [N···H] species and the hydrogen evolution reaction occurs on the ligand, [24] we investigated the reduction behavior of [Zn-ATSE]<sub>2</sub> by using cyclic voltammetry. As shown in Figure 2b, addition of varied contents of acetic acid from 0.0 to 9.00 mM resulted in a systematic increase in the voltammetric currents emerging at -1.90 V versus Ag/AgNO<sub>3</sub>, an additional positive shift in the potential from -1.69 to -1.35 V (Figure 2b). Furthermore, in the presence of acetic acid, the increase of [ZnATSE]<sub>2</sub> concentrations from 0.038 to 0.80 mM led to a systematic increase in the voltammetric currents emerging at -1.60 V versus Ag/AgNO<sub>3</sub> (Figure S8). These findings are consistent with a catalytic process. [25,26]

To confirm our deduction that the ligand, H2ATSE, plays a role in determining the catalytic activities for hydrogen evolution, also investigated

electrochemical behavior of H2ATSE under the same conditions. According to the data listed in Figure S5b, with the sequential increments of acetic acid concentration from 0.00 to 4.00 mM, the strengths of current at −1.90 V increase, indicating that H<sub>2</sub>ATSE does indeed catalyze proton reduction to generate hydrogen from acetic acid, but it has no positive shift in the potential. The results suggest that the hydrogen evolution reaction occurs both on the ligand and zinc center.

It is apparent that zinc complexes are not often considered as good candidates for catalysts, and the above electrochemical investigations show that the zinc complex, [Zn-ATSE]<sub>2</sub>, can electro-catalyze hydrogen production. To explore catalytic mechanism for hydrogen evolution of [Zn-ATSE]<sub>2</sub>, several measurements and analyses were carried out. According to Figure S9, in a DMF solution, [Zn-ATSE]<sub>2</sub> exhibited one ion at a mass-tocharge ratio (m/z) of 351.0399, with mass and isotope distribution pattern corresponding to [Zn-ATSE-H]<sup>+</sup>, indicating that a monomer is formed. Moreover, after recrystallization, [Zn-ATSE]2 is obtained again. So that, [Zn-ATSE]<sub>2</sub> exists in two forms: a dimer in solid and a monomer in DMF solution (Scheme 2).

The B3LYP/6-31G\*(d,p) model was also used to estimate the energies of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) in Zn-ATSE, with the results shown in Figure 3. According to Figure 3, the energies of the

10990739, 2022, 4, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/aoc.6572 by University Of Science, Wiley Online Library on [07/01/2026].

HOMO and LUMO were 5.604 eV eV and 2.074 eV, respectively. The bandgap was 3.53 eV. Moreover, UV– Vis spectrum of Zn-ATSE was generated by timedependent DFT, giving the result shown in Figure S10.

FIGURE 2 (a) Cyclic voltammogram of 1.00-mM [Zn-ATSE]2 in 0.10 M of [n-Bu4N]ClO4 CH3CN solution at a glassy carbon electrode and a scan rate of 100 mV/s. (b) Cyclic voltammograms of 1.00-mM [Zn-ATSE]2 with various concentrations of acetic acid in CH3CN

The result that Zn-ATSE has two main peaks at 307 and 423 nm is also consistent with the following experimental investigations.

As shown in Figure S11, H2ATSE mainly exhibited one band at 328 nm, and [Zn-ATSE]2 had one band at 423 nm. Compared with that of H2ATSE (328 nm), the absorption maximum of the low-energy band of [Zn-ATSE]2 (423 nm) was red shifted to longer wavelength. The result can be attributed to the charge transfer from the zinc (II) ion to the deprotonated ligand (ATSE2), as well as the intraligand transitions of ATSE2.

From Figure 4, the zinc complex, [Zn-ATSE]2, showed an electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) sign with <g> = 2.1, indicating that there are unpaired electrons or delocalized electrons in [Zn-ATSE]. So that, the hydrazine group of [Zn-ATSE] plays critical roles in the catalytic reaction, facilitating the formation or cleavage of the H H bond and mediating electron or proton

transfer between the Zn and exogenous base.[27,28] The roles of the hydrazine group for the hydride, [Zn-ATSE-H], can be analogous to those thought to be employed by the active of the [FeFe] hydrogenase.[6,7]

Based on the abovementioned results, discussion, and the reported points, [[19,21,24,29–32]] we put forth a possible catalytic H2 evolution mechanism by [Zn-ATSE]2. As shown in Scheme 3, a putative species, [Zn<sup>I</sup> -ATSE] (B) is formed by a one-electron reduction of [Zn-ATSE] (A). Then, the introduction of one H<sup>+</sup> ion gives one 4-coordinated zinc complex, [Zn<sup>I</sup> -ATSE-H] (C). The further addition of hydrogen proton provides one zinc (III)-hydride species, [H-ZnIII-ATSE-H] <sup>+</sup> (D). Finally, a

one-electron reduction of [H-ZnIII-ATSE-H] <sup>+</sup> (D) affords H2 and regenerates the starting complex, [Zn-ATSE].

Next, bulk electrolysis was carried out to further get the evidence for the electro-catalytic activity of [Zn-ATSE]2, with the results shown in Figure S12. For instance, when the applied potential was 1.45 V versus Ag/AgNO3, two electrocatalytic systems with or without [Zn-ATSE]2 can provide 78 and 10 mC of charge, respectively (Figure S12). This result shows that this zinc complex does serve an electrocatalyst for hydrogen production from acetic acid under such conditions, using equations 1[33] and 2[34] to estimate the electrocatalytic activity and overpotential (OP), respectively. From the calculated results listed in Figure S13, when the OP is 941.6 mV, this electrocatalytic system can afford 64 mol H2 mol catalyst<sup>1</sup> .

Next, electrochemical properties of this zinc complex were investigated in aqueous media. As shown in Figure S14, with decreasing pH values from 7.0 to 5.5, FIGURE 4 EPR spectrum of [Zn-ATSE]2 in solid the strength of the reduction wave of [Zn-ATSE]2

increased, and the onset of the catalytic wave were shifted to higher potentials. Moreover, with an increase of [Zn-ATSE]<sub>2</sub>, a systematic increase in  $i_{cat}$  was observed (Figure S15). These results are consistent with a catalytic process.<sup>[26]</sup>

Similarly, the electrochemical measurements for  $H_2ASTE$  were carried out in the same conditions. As shown in Figure S16,  $H_2ASTE$  also showed a pH-dependent peak, and increasing pH values led the applied potential to decline.

To get further insight into the evidence for the catalytic activity of the zinc complex, bulk electrolysis was carried out in an aqueous buffer of  $[Zn-ATSE]_2$  (6.32  $\mu$ M), giving the results listed in Figure 5. According to Figure 5a, in presence of  $[Zn-ATSE]_2$ , the charge significantly increased when the applied potentials were set to more negative. For example, under -1.45 V versus Ag/AgCl, the electrolysis of a neutral buffer with

**FIGURE 5** (a) Charge buildup versus time from the electrolysis of a neutral water with 6.32-μM [Zn-ATSE]<sub>2</sub> under various applied potentials. All data have been deducted blank. (b) Charge buildup versus time from the electrolysis of a neutral aqueous buffer under -1.45 V versus Ag/AgCl

[Zn-ATSE] $_2$  could afford a charge of 123 mC during 2 min of electrolysis, accompanying generation of  $H_2$ , which was confirmed by gas chromatography. According to the data listed in Figure S17a, 1-h electrolysis of a neutral with 6.32- $\mu$ M [Zn-ATSE] $_2$  could provide 5.8 ml of  $H_2$  with a Faradaic efficiency of 92% for  $H_2$  (Figure S17b). However, under the identical condition, the electrolysis of a neutral buffer without [Zn-ATSE] $_2$  only gave 13 mC of charge (Figure 5b). The result clearly indicates that [Zn-ATSE] $_2$  does act as an effective electrocatalyst for hydrogen generation from water under such conditions. For example, under -1.45 V versus Ag/AgCl, this electrocatalytic system with [Zn-ATSE] $_2$  could afford 105 mol  $H_2$  mol catalyst  $^{-1}$  h  $^{-1}$ .

Similar procedure to  $[Zn-ATSE]_2$ , bulk electrolysis by  $H_2ATSE$  was conducted in a 0.10-M neutral buffer (pH 7.0). According to Figure S18, during 2 min of electrolysis, the addition of  $H_2ATSE$  gives 155 mC of charge. Moreover, 1-h electrolysis of a neutral with 6.32- $\mu$ M  $H_2ATSE$  could afford 0.02 ml of  $H_2$  (Figure S19). Remarkably,  $[Zn-ATSE]_2$  exhibits higher efficiency for hydrogen production than  $H_2TASE$ .

To further prove that  $[Zn-ATSE]_2$  is indeed responsible for electrocatalytic  $H_2$  generation in the above system, a series of control experiments were carried out. As shown in Figure S20, a neutral buffer solution only provided 3.5 C of charge during 1 h of electrolysis under -1.45 V versus Ag/AgCl. The use of solely  $H_2ATSE$  as a catalyst could afford  $H_2$  with 4.05 C of charge. However, in the presence of  $[Zn-ATSE]_2$ , bulk electrolysis could provide  $H_2$  with 11.52 C of charge. The results show that the combination of zinc ion with  $ATSE^{2-}$  is essential for catalytic activity in above electrocatalytic system.

## 3.5 | Stability of [ZnATSE]<sub>2</sub>

To check the stability and durability of [ZnATSE]<sub>2</sub>, a series of experiments were carried out. As shown in Figure S21, after 20-cycle CVs, the current strengths remained almost constant. After an electrochemical measurement of [ZnATSE]<sub>2</sub>, a subsequent CV measurement did not show any catalytic behavior distinct from that of the pristine electrode (Figure S22). Moreover, at the working electrode, there was no evidence for precipitation formation by energy dispersive spectrometer and scanning electron microscope (SEM) (Figure S23) after a 6-h electrolysis period. These findings indicate that no deposit is formed on electrode (equation 3), [35] and ZnATSE is stable during electrochemical measurements.

## 3.6 | Hydrogen oxidation catalyzed by [Zn-ATSE]2

Inspired by that platinum is used as a catalyst in a hydrogen-oxygen fuel cell,[36,37] we also tried to explore the catalytic hydrogen oxidation of [Zn-ATSE]2, a much more attractive medium for the sustainable generation

FIGURE 6 Cyclic voltammograms of 1.00-mM [Zn-ATSE]2 in acetonitrile under H2 with varying concentrations of triethylamine (TEA)

and storage of hydrogen energy. The CVs of [Zn-ATSE]2 recorded on solutions purged with hydrogen and varying concentrations of triethylamine (TEA) were showed in Figure 6. With addition of varied contents of triethylamine from 0.0 to 9.00 mM, a systematic increase in the voltammetric currents emerging at 1.0 and 0.57 V versus Ag/AgNO3 was found. These findings are consistent with a catalytic process for hydrogen oxidation,[16,38] indicating that the oxidation of [Zn-ATSE]2 is responsible for hydrogen oxidation. Additionally, under H2, the free ligand, H2ATSE, had an oxidation wave at 0.66 V versus Ag/AgNO3 (Figure S24). However, the introduction of triethylamine resulted in a decrease in the voltammetric current emerging at 0.66 V versus Ag/AgNO3 (Figure S24). This result suggests that the combination of zinc ion with ATSE2 is essential for catalytic activity in this electrocatalytic hydrogen oxidation system. To further understand hydrogen oxidation product, a Verkade's base (2,8,9-triisopropyl-2,5,8,9-tetraaza-1-phosphabicyclo [3.3.3]undecane) 1 was used as a proton acceptor. From Figure S25, with Verkade's base 1, the electrolysis of 1.00 mM of [Zn-ATSE]2 DMF solution under H2 led to a new peak appeared at 10.8 ppm, which can be assigned to 1H+.

Together, the above findings, analyses, and the known points,[21,22,39–41] a possible catalytic H2 oxidation mechanism by [Zn-ATSE] was schemed. As shown in Scheme 4, a one-electron oxidation of [Zn-ATSE] (A) affords a Zn (III) species, [ZnIII-ATSE]<sup>+</sup> (E). Then, the addition of H2 gives one H2 Zn complex, [ATSE-ZnIII-

The heterolytic cleavage of H—H in [**ATSE**-Zn<sup>III</sup>-**H<sub>2</sub>**]<sup>+</sup> (**F**) provides one zinc (III)-hydride species, [**H**-Zn<sup>III</sup>-ATSE-**H**]<sup>+</sup> (**G**). In the presence of Base, the further reduction of [**H**-Zn<sup>III</sup>-ATSE-**H**]<sup>+</sup> (**G**) gives H-Base<sup>+</sup> and the starting complex, [Zn-ATSE].

To further study the catalytic efficiency for hydrogen oxidation of [Zn-ATSE]<sub>2</sub>, the relationship of the electrocatalytic current ( $i_{cat}$ ) with the current for a reversible redox process for the electrocatalyst ( $i_p$ ) was investigated (equation 4).<sup>[42,43]</sup> Then,  $k_{obs}$  is usually referred as turnover frequency (TOF) of the catalyst (equation 5).<sup>[39,44]</sup>

$$\frac{i_c}{i_p} = \frac{n}{0.4463} \sqrt{\frac{RTK_{obs}}{F\nu}}, \tag{4}$$

$$TOF = K_{obs} = \left(\frac{0.4463i_c}{ni_n}\right)^2 \frac{F\nu}{RT},$$
 (5)

where n, F, and  $\nu$  are the normal electrochemical terms related to the number of electrons transferred, Faraday's constant, and scan rate, respectively. The factor of 0.4463 is related to the diffusion equations, R is the gas constant, and T is temperature in K.

Together, the slope of the plot of  $i_{cat}/i_p$  versus  $\nu^{-1/2}$  (Figure 7) with equation 5, the catalytic efficiency (TOF) for hydrogen oxidation was estimated to be 13.52 s<sup>-1</sup>.

To determine OP ( $\eta$ ) for hydrogen oxidation by [ZnATSE]<sub>2</sub>, equation  $6^{[39]}$  was used. Based on  $E_{cat/2}=0.530\,V$  (Figure 8) and  $E_{OCP}=0.120\,V$ ,  $\eta$  was estimated to be 0.41 V.

$$\eta = \left| \left( E_{OCP} - E_{cat/2} \right) \right|, \tag{6}$$

where  $E_{OCP}$  is the measured open circuit potential measured under catalytic conditions specific for each reaction and  $E_{cat/2}$  is the potential at one half the maximum of the catalytic current measured for hydrogen oxidation by  $[ZnATSE]_2$ .

### 4 | CONCLUSION

In this paper, we described a new zinc complex, [Zn-ATSE]<sub>2</sub>, that is afforded by the reaction of the ligand, H<sub>2</sub>TASE, with Zn (CH<sub>3</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>. [Zn-ATSE]<sub>2</sub> has been fully characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, XRD, EPR, and electrochemical methods. Electrochemical investigations reveal that [Zn-ATSE]<sub>2</sub> shows efficient activities for both hydrogen generation and oxidation. Our ongoing efforts are focused on modifying ligands to give the related complexes, providing the related species that can serve as catalysts both for hydrogen evolution reaction and hydrogen oxidation reactions.

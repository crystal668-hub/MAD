**Abstract:** CO poisoning of Pt group metal (PGM) catalysts is a chronic problem for hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR), the anodic reaction of hydroxide exchange membrane fuel cell (HEMFC) for converting H2 to electric energy in sustainable manner. We demonstrate here an ultrathin Ru-based nanoflower modified with Pb (PbRuCu NF) as an active, stable, and CO-resistant catalyst for alkaline HOR. Mechanism studies show that the presence of Pb can weaken the adsorption of \*H, strengthen \*OH adsorption to facilitate CO oxidation, as a result of significantly enhanced HOR activity and improved CO tolerance. Furthermore, in situ electrochemical attenuated total reflection surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR-SEIRAS) suggests that Pb acts as oxygen-rich site to regulate the behavior of the linear CO adsorption. The optimized Pb1.04-Ru92Cu8/C displays a mass activity and specific activity of 1.10 AmgRu <sup>1</sup> and 5.55 mAcm <sup>2</sup> , which are �10 and �31 times higher than those of commercial Pt/C. This work provides a facile strategy for the design of Ru-based catalyst with high activity and strong CO-resistance for alkaline HOR, which may promote the fundamental researches on the rational design of functional catalysts.

### *Introduction*

Hydroxide exchange membrane fuel cell (HEMFC) is one of the most promising energy conversion devices for converting green hydrogen to electric energy in a sustainable manner.[1–5] However, the major concerns of high cost and availability of implementation still need to be overcome before large-scale commercialization.[6] To date, up to 95% of hydrogen (H2) in industry is produced by reforming fossil

fuels, which inevitably contains CO impurity that can strongly adsorb on the surface of Pt group metals,[7–9] resulting in a decline of HEMFC performance and life expectancy.[10] Therefore, HEMFC poses a challenge to the toxicity resistance of anodic hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) catalysts. At present, the popular strategies for suppressing CO poisoning are (1) promoting CO oxidation with the assistance of oxophilic metals[11,12] and (2) weakening CO adsorption by adjusting the electronic properties of the catalysts.[13,14] Despite great process has been achieved for developing catalysts with improved CO tolerance, a steady HOR performance for over 1 h in the presence of CO remains a major challenge, which severely limits its large-scale practical application.

Ru displays similar property but much lower price in comparison to Pt, and therefore has been regarded as a promising candidate for HOR.[15,16] Recent studies mainly focus on the interfacial regulation of Ru-based materials to alter the electronic structure and atomic valence bond for strengthening CO-resistance.[17–19] For instance, Zhou demonstrated that Ru cluster confined in the lattice of urchinlike TiO2 (Ru@TiO2) could suppress the transfer of σ electrons from CO to the vacant orbital of Ru metal *d*-band and its adsorption on Ru.[20] The poisoning phenomenon of precious metal catalysts is mainly due to the strong chemisorption of the bridge and triple bonds between metal atoms and CO molecules, but some bimetallic nanomaterials with ultrathin two-dimensional (2D) nanosheets can avoid it from the structure of the material itself.[21] Bimetallic nanomaterials with ultrathin 2D nanosheets can adjust the electronic structure of the catalyst, thus making *d*-band center negatively shifts.[22–24] Hence, appropriately designed 2D Ru-based nanosheets may exhibit high tolerance to CO poisoning.

Considering the unique electronic properties of ultrathin nanosheets, we report PbRuCu nanoflowers (NFs) composed of ultrathin nanosheets can serve as efficient catalysts for alkaline HOR. Experimental observations and in situ characterizations show that the presence of Pb can weaken the adsorption of \*H, strengthen the CO-resistance, and facilitate CO oxidation, as a result of significantly enhanced HOR activity and improved CO tolerance. The optimized Pb1.04-Ru92Cu8/C displays a mass activity and specific activity of 1.10 AmgRu <sup>1</sup> and 5.55 mAcm <sup>2</sup> , which are �10 and �31 times higher than those of commercial Pt/C. Moreover, Pb1.04-Ru92Cu8/C exhibits superior CO-resistance to RuCu NFs/C and commercial Pt/C, where the current decreases by 12.8% after 3600 s, while Ru92Cu8/C and commercial Pt/C

decrease by 37.0% and 86.0%, respectively. This work provides a facile strategy for the design of Ru-based with high activity and strong CO-resistance for alkaline HOR, which will attract rapid interests in chemistry, materials, catalysis and beyond.

### *Results and Discussion*

Ultrathin PbRuCu NFs were prepared via a two-step method, in which RuCu NFs were obtained by reducing RuBr3 and Cu(acac)2 with hydroquinone in olamine (Figure S1), followed by depositing Pb(acac)2 with different contents (Figure S2). The Pb-modified RuCu NFs were named as Pbx-RuyCuz NFs, where *x* represents as the surface atomic percentage of Pb, while *y* and *z* represent as the atomic percentage of Ru and Cu in RuCu NFs (Table S1). Taking Pb1.04-Ru92Cu8 NFs as an example, transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Figure 1a) and high-angle annular dark-field scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM, Figure 1b) images implied that Pb1.04-Ru92Cu8 NFs displayed a crinkly two-dimensional (2D) morphology. The lateral diameter and thickness were measured to be �33 and �2 nm, respectively (Figures S3 and S4). The peaks in X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of Pb1.04-Ru92Cu8 NFs were ascribed to the hexagonal close-packed (*hcp*) phase of Ru, while the shifted peak suggested that Ru was alloyed with Cu (Figure 1c).[25] No peak shift was observed in XRD

pattern after depositing Ru92Cu8 NFs with Pb, indicating that Pb was located on the surface (Figure S5). The atomic ratio of Ru/Cu/Pb was determined to be 92.5/5/3.5 by the energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy (Figure 1d). The interplanar spacing of 0.244 nm in the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image of Pb1.04-Ru92Cu8 NFs could be indexed as the (101) plane of *hcp*-Ru, which was consistent with XRD (Figure 1e). The elemental mapping and linescanning profile implied that Ru, Cu and Pb were evenly distributed in Pb1.04-Ru92Cu8 NFs (Figures 1f and S6). Moreover, the morphology and dimension of Pbx-Ru92Cu8 NFs were largely reserved as varying the contents of Pb (Figures S2–S7). Furthermore, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was employed to study the surface properties of Pbx-Ru92Cu8 NFs (Figure S8 and Table S1), where the peak signal intensity of Pb gradually strengthened as the initial input of Pb increased.[26,27]

To investigate the role of Pb on the catalytic activity of RuCu NFs, alkaline HOR performance was evaluated in a standard three-electrode system with rotating disk electrode (RDE) in H2-saturated 0.1 M KOH solution. Screening experiments were performed for selecting optimal RuCu NFs for Pb modification. RuCu NFs with different Ru/Cu atomic ratios were synthesized. Note that the alteration of Ru/Cu ratio had negligible influence on the morphology of RuCu nanostructures (Figure S9). Analysis on polarization curves suggested that Ru92Cu8 NFs/C displayed higher HOR activity than Ru94Cu6 NFs/C and Ru86Cu14 NFs/C (Figure S10), and therefore was selected as optimal candidate for Pd modification. Afterwards, Pb1.04-Ru92Cu8/C and Ru92Cu8/C were pre-evaluated in N2-saturated 0.1 M KOH solution to measure the anodic current for HOR process. The current density is 0 when the potential was exceeded 0.1 V, indicating that the current was originated HOR (Figure S11). It was found that Pb1.04-Ru92Cu8/C displayed higher HOR activity comparing with Ru92Cu8/C and commercial Pt/C (Figure 2a). The decay of HOR activity above 0.1 V was attributed to Ru passivation.[28] The fitting results based on Butler–Volmer equation in Tafel region were in accordance with the exchange current densities (*j*0) in the range of 5–5 mV (Figure 2b, 2c), further confirming that the introduction of Pb could significantly enhance alkaline HOR activity. Moreover, the HOR activity was depended on Pb content, and Pb1.04-Ru92Cu8/C was selected as the optimal catalyst for alkaline HOR (Figures S12 and S13). Furthermore, copper underpotential deposition (Cuupd) was applied to measure the electrochemical surface area (ECSA) to quantitatively compare alkaline HOR activities of various catalysts (Figure S14 and Table S2). As depicted in Figure 2d, the mass activities at 50 mV of Pb1.04-Ru92Cu8/ C, Pb2.34-Ru92Cu8/C, Pb0.12-Ru92Cu8/C, and Ru92Cu8/C were 1.10, 0.93, 0.76, and 0.63 AmgRu 1 , respectively, which were 10.0, 8.5, 6.9, and 5.7 times higher than those of commercial Pt/C (0.11 A mgPt 1 ). Besides, the specific activities at 50 mV of Pb1.04-Ru92Cu8/C, Pb2.34-Ru92Cu8/C, Pb0.12-Ru92Cu8/C, and Ru92Cu8/C were 5.55, 4.39, 3.45, and 2.22 mAcm <sup>2</sup> , respectively, which were 30.8, 24.4, 19.2 and 12.3 times higher than those of Pt/C (0.18 mAcm <sup>2</sup> ) (Figure S15 and Table S3). The above results implied that surface engineering of RuCu

NFs with Pb could significantly facilitate alkaline HOR activity.

#### Stability test

Afterwards, the stability of Pb<sub>1.04</sub>-Ru<sub>92</sub>Cu<sub>8</sub>/C was evaluated for alkaline HOR. As shown in Figure 3a, the current of Pb<sub>1.04</sub>-Ru<sub>92</sub>Cu<sub>8</sub> NFs/C decreased by 9.1 % after 1 h continuous test, which was much smaller than those of Ru<sub>92</sub>Cu<sub>8</sub>/C (20.7 %), commercial Pt/C (22.7 %), and other Pb<sub>x</sub>-RuCu/C, suggesting that the presence of Pb could promote the HOR performance (Figure S16). Moreover, the structure and morphology of Pb<sub>1.04</sub>-Ru<sub>92</sub>Cu<sub>8</sub>/C were largely reserved after 1 h chronoamperometry test, implying that Pb modification contributed to the stabilization of Ru<sub>92</sub>Cu<sub>8</sub>/C for alkaline HOR (Figures S17 and S18). Besides, 88.1 % and 75.8 % of the initial current was maintained for Pb<sub>1.04</sub>-Ru<sub>92</sub>Cu<sub>8</sub>/C after 3 h and 5 h, further confirming its enhanced stability for

alkaline HOR (Figure S19). Considering that the industrially produced H<sub>2</sub> may contain trace amount of CO, the resistance to CO-poisoning was also evaluated. As shown in Figure 3b, when Pb<sub>1.04</sub>-Ru<sub>92</sub>Cu<sub>8</sub>/C was used as catalyst, the current decreased by 12.8% after 1 h in the presence of 100 ppm CO, which was much lower than that of Ru<sub>92</sub>Cu<sub>8</sub>/C (37%). Note that the current and the apparent HOR activity at 50 mV decreased by 21.8 % and 15.7 % when the reaction time was extended to 3 h (Figure S20). Besides, the polarization curves of Pb<sub>1.04</sub>-Ru<sub>92</sub>Cu<sub>8</sub>/C at 50 mV remained basically unchanged after introducing 100 ppm CO (Figure S21), suggesting that Pb modification could significantly strengthen the CO resistance of Ru<sub>92</sub>Cu<sub>8</sub>/C. The morphology of Pb<sub>1.04</sub>-Ru<sub>92</sub>Cu<sub>8</sub>/C was reserved after exposing to CO after 1 h, further validating the promising stability of Pb<sub>1.04</sub>-Ru<sub>92</sub>Cu<sub>8</sub>/C for alkaline HOR (Figure S22). Additionally, Pb<sub>1 04</sub>-Ru<sub>9</sub>Cu<sub>8</sub> NFs/C displayed much superior CO tolerance to Ru<sub>92</sub>Cu<sub>8</sub> NPs/C and Pb<sub>1.04</sub>-Ru<sub>92</sub>Cu<sub>8</sub> NPs/C (Figure S23). 15213757, 2023. 44, Downloaded from https://onlinelbrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ange.202311722 by University Of Science, Wiley Online Library on [07/01/2026].

Note that Pb1.04-Ru92Cu8/C has outperformed many reported catalysts for alkaline HOR (Table S4).

To reveal the mechanism for the enhanced HOR performance, Ru, Cu, Pb, and O XPS spectra were collected to investigate the surface properties of Pbx-Ru92Cu8 NFs (Figures 4a and S24). The peaks at �462.27 and �465.48 eV in the Ru 3*p*3/2 spectra were ascribed to Ru0 and Ru4<sup>+</sup>, respectively. After the introduction of Pb, the Ru<sup>0</sup> peak of Pb1.04-Ru92Cu8 NFs negatively shifted by 0.46 eV. In Cu 2*p* XPS spectra, the surface modification with Pb led to the positive shift of Cu<sup>0</sup> peak (Figures 4b and S25). The increasing content of Pb resulted in slight positive shift of Pb 4*f* peak in XPS spectra (Figure 4c). The above results confirmed that the electron could transfer from Cu and Pb to Ru, as evidenced by the alterations of Ru<sup>0</sup> /Ru<sup>4</sup><sup>+</sup>, Cu<sup>0</sup> / Cu<sup>n</sup><sup>+</sup> and Pb<sup>0</sup> /Pb<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> ratios (Table S5).[29] Considering the differences in surface electronic properties might influence the adsorption abilities to different species and thus the HOR activity, the *d*-band centers of Pbx-Ru92Cu8 NFs/C were analyzed.[30] As shown in Figure 4d, compared to Ru92Cu8/C ( 3.12 eV), the *d*-band centers of Pbx-Ru92Cu8/C were far away from the Fermi level, indicating that the introduction of Pb could attenuate the adsorption abilities to \*H and \*CO in alkaline HOR. Besides, the weakening \*H adsorption was confirmed by analyzing the underpotential deposited hydrogen (Hupd) stripping peak (Figure 4e).[31] The superior HOR activity of Pbx-Ru92Cu8/C to Ru92Cu8/C was ascribed to the weakened Ru H binding after Pb modification, as reflected by the more negative Hupd stripping peak position. Furthermore, CO-stripping experiments were performed to evaluate the resistance of Pbx-Ru92Cu8/C to CO

poisoning (Figure 4f). Compared with Ru92Cu8/C, the COstripping peak potentials of Pb1.04-Ru92Cu8/C, Pb0.12-Ru92Cu8/ C and Pb2.34-Ru92Cu8/C were negatively shifted by �88, �73 and �66 mV, respectively. Owing to the competitive adsorption of \*CO and \*OH adsorption during alkaline HOR, Pb could as an oxygen-rich site to promote CO oxidation during alkaline HOR.[32] Based on the above analysis, the enhanced alkaline HOR performance of Rubased materials originated from the weakened HBE and strengthened \*OH adsorption by Pb.

Electrochemical in situ attenuated total reflection surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR-SEI-RAS) was employed to further investigate the significance of Pb modification on CO adsorption. In general, CO preferentially adsorbs on the active site of the anode catalysts, leading to the inhibition of H2 oxidation. The oxidation of CO is divided into two types because of its adsorption state: CO in the weakly adsorbed state (bridge adsorption, \*COB) can be oxidized at a lower potential, and CO in the strongly adsorbed state (linear adsorption, \*COL) has to be oxidized at a higher potential, while \*COL adsorption is the main cause of catalyst poisoning.[33] As illustrated in Figure 5a, the peak at 1980–1920 and 1900– 1870 cm <sup>1</sup> in the ATR-SEIRAS spectra of Pb1.04-Ru92Cu8 NFs were ascribed to \*COL and \*COB, respectively.[34] Besides, the presence of carboxylate species (CO2 <sup>δ</sup> ) at �1390 cm <sup>1</sup> in the ATR-SEIRAS spectra of Pb1.04-Ru92Cu8 NFs further confirmed the oxidation of CO.[35] Despite similar phenomena were observed for Ru92Cu8 NFs, \*COL is barely detectable due to the introduction of Pb at high anode potential, making \*COL the main reason for deactivation of Ru92Cu8 NFs/C in alkaline HOR (Figure 5b).[36] Note that the wavenumbers of \*COL and \*COB in Pb1.04-Ru92Cu8 NFs are higher than those of Ru92Cu8 NFs, revealing the surface modification of Pb can lower the *d*-band center of RuCu substrate to attenuate \*CO adsorption. The integral area of \*CO and ratio of \*COB to \*COL in Pb1.04-Ru92Cu8 NFs and Ru92Cu8 NFs were employ to analyze the effects of Pb introduction on CO adsorption (Figure S26). As displayed in Figure 5c, the adsorbed \*CO on the Pb1.04-Ru92Cu8 NFs was lower than that on the Ru92Cu8 NFs in the potential range of 0.25–0.75 V, implying that Pb modification could significantly weaken CO adsorption and thus promote CO tolerance. Besides, the introduction of Pb led to the significant increasement of \*COB/\*COL ratio, suggesting that CO poisoning was largely depended on CO linear adsorption (Figure 5d). Compared to Ru92Cu8 NFs, the smaller normalized peak area of CO adsorption of Pb1.04- Ru92Cu8 NFs suggested that CO adsorption, especially linear adsorption, was strongly weakened after Pb modification. Given the competitive adsorption of H2 and CO, efficient catalysts for HOR should be capable of oxidizing CO to CO2. [37] According to the normalized peak area of intermediate CO2 <sup>δ</sup> , the CO oxidation rate of Pb1.04- Ru92Cu8 NFs is higher than that of Ru92Cu8 NFs, and reaches its maximum in the range of 0–0.3 V. By comparing the anode potential interval in HOR, Pb can be regarded as an oxygen-rich site to provide oxygen-containing intermediate species (\*OH) to the surrounding Ru atoms, thus promoting the oxidation of CO (Figure S27). Consequently, the effect of Pb modification was realized by weakening \*H adsorption and strengthening CO-poisoning resistance via oxidation (Figure 5e). Moreover, the introduction of Pb species can also contribute 15213757, 2023, 44, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ange.202311722 by University Of Science, Wiley Online Library on [07/01/2026].

to strengthen hydroxide binding energy (OHBE), which further promotes HOR performance.

### *Conclusion*

In conclusion, we have demonstrated that ultrathin RuCu NFs modified with Pb can serve as highly active and stable catalysts for alkaline HOR. Impressively, the mass activity and specific activity of Pb1.04-Ru92Cu8 NFs are 1.10 AmgRu <sup>1</sup> and 5.55 mAcm <sup>2</sup> , respectively, which are �10 and �31 times higher than those of commercial Pt/C. The enhanced alkaline HOR performance is synergistically originated from the weakened HBE and strengthened OHBE. Mechanism studies show that the presence of Pb can regulate the adsorption behavior of \*H, \*OH and \*CO, as a result of the significantly enhanced HOR activity and the improved CO tolerance. Results from the electrochemical in situ ATR-SEIRAS suggest that Pb can act as oxygen-rich site to accelerate the oxidation of CO linear adsorption. This work not only discloses the importance of surface modification on Ru towards alkaline HOR, but also provides an promising strategy for the rational design of Ru-based catalysts with enhanced activity and strengthened resistance to CO poisoning.

The kinetics of the hydrogen electrode reaction on a platinized nickel electrode in alkaline solutions over a wide temperature range from ambient up to 220o C have been investigated employing a controlled hydrodynamic cell. Due to the reversible nature of this reaction, the generalized Butler-Volmer equation was used in optimization upon the polarization data, so as to account for kinetic, thermodynamic, and mass transfer effects. The extracted model parameters are compared with those for other forms of platinum electrode, and platinized nickel shows excellent electrocatalytic activity as demonstrated by the exchange current density. The extracted apparent transfer coefficients for hydrogen evolution and hydrogen oxidation are temperature-dependent, while the apparent Tafel slope of the hydrogen evolution reaction is temperatureindependent (approximately 120mV/dec), which is most probably due to two parallel reactions occurring at the interface with different rates and activation energies. An Arrhenius analysis yields an activation energy of 17.3 kJ/mole for the hydrogen electrode reaction on platinized nickel in alkaline solution.

## **Introduction**

The hydrogen electrode reaction on platinum or platinum-based alloys is one of the most intensively investigated electrochemical process(1-10) and it has served as a model to establish the so called "volcano plot" for electrocatalysis. Furthermore, the kinetics of this reaction are becoming a matter of great importance in the production of hydrogen by the electrolysis of aqueous solutions and it is likely that electrolysis, using inexpensive electrical energy from large nuclear power plants, will become a primary source of fuel for mobile applications (e.g., automobiles, trains, and perhaps even aircraft) in the future. The efficiency of hydrogen production by the electrolysis of aqueous solutions is determined, to a significant extent, by the kinetics of the hydrogen electrode reaction.

The "volcano plot"(11-13) correlates the exchange current density with the standard Gibbs energy of hydrogen adsorption, and platinum sits on top of this volcano (signifying the highest catalytic activity). However, regardless of the position of platinum on the volcano plot, this plot does not indicate any mechanistic information of the reactions, nor does it incorporate the effect of temperature, as almost all of the data that were used in its derivation were measured at ambient or near ambient temperature. Depending on the

nature of the electrode/electrolyte interface, the reaction mechanism and kinetics may vary considerably.

Currently, the operating temperature for commercially available proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) is limited to 80-100°C, due to the dewatering of the membrane at higher temperatures and due to a concomitant, sudden increase in membrane resistance(14-16). Nevertheless, with continued advances in membrane technology, it is envisioned PEMFCs will operate at significantly higher temperatures than is now possible. Higher temperature operation implies higher exchange current densities and lower activation over-potentials for the oxygen electrode reaction (OER) and the hydrogen electrode reaction, and lower susceptibility of the anode catalyst to poisoning by trace amounts of CO in the hydrogen fuel(17,18). However, to date, most of the work reported on the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) and OER has only been carried out at temperatures below 70°C, due to the limitations of experimental systems. Therefore, it is of great interest and importance to characterize the kinetics and mechanism(s) of the hydrogen electrode reaction and oxygen electrode reaction at elevated temperatures. The current paper addresses the kinetics of the hydrogen electrode reaction in alkaline media over an extended temperature range.

Only a few studies of the hydrogen electrode reaction have been carried out at elevated temperatures. Thus, Tsionskii et al(19) studied this reaction on mercury in HCl solutions at temperatures up to 300°C and Biswas et al(20) previously studied the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) on platinized nickel in our laboratory, but that work was not able to characterize the kinetics or the reaction mechanisms. In this work, with a specially designed apparatus, having controllable hydrodynamic properties, a wide range of conditions (temperature, polarization, and mass transfer) may be accessed, in order to investigate the kinetics of both hydrogen oxidation and hydrogen evolution; i.e. the hydrogen electrode reaction. The current study has unveiled the temperature dependence of the kinetics of the hydrogen electrode reaction and provides useful information for modeling the performance of practical electrolyzers for producing hydrogen and provides equally useful information for modeling high temperature alkaline fuel cells.

KOH solutions were used in this study, as many practical electrolyzers for producing hydrogen employ alkaline solutions and it is found that fuel cells using alkaline solutions show considerably better performance than do other types of fuel cells when operating below 200°C(5). Recently, polymer membranes using alkaline media (anion-exchange membranes) have also been intensively investigated (21-25), and they show promise for resolving several technical problems associated with traditional proton exchange membranes, e.g. the low catalytic activity of the ORR and dissolution of non-noble catalysts.

### **Experimental**

A specially designed apparatus with controllable hydrodynamic properties was used in this work for studying the hydrogen electrode reaction at elevated temperatures. Details for the working principles of the apparatus and analysis of the hydrodynamic properties are given in previous papers (26,27). Here, only some key issues are briefly addressed.

Experiments were carried out in a controlled hydrodynamic flow channel contained within a nickel pressure vessel, which was heated by an electric heater controlled with a proportional temperature controller. The vessel was connected to a once through/recirculating flow loop. In order to maintain the system in a single aqueous phase at elevated temperatures (T > 100o C), a high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) pump and a pressure control valve were used to pressurize the entire system well above the vapor pressure of the electrolyte. Thus, the pressure was maintained to be at least 14bar higher than the water vapor pressure at the corresponding temperature.

The working electrode was prepared by electroplating a nickel cylinder with bright platinum (termed a "platinized nickel" electrode), and the counter electrode was a nickel wire mounted against the nickel flow channel. The reference electrode was a Ag/AgCl electrode located in a PTFE tube containing saturated KCl solution. All of the measured potentials were converted to the SHE scale using thermodynamic data and calculations. Thus, because the standard potential of the reference electrode (half cell reaction <sup>−</sup> <sup>−</sup> +↔+ *ClAgeAgCl* ) varies with temperature, its potential at each temperature was calculated using Chemical Reaction and Equilibrium Software with Extensive Thermochemical Database (Version 5.1) by Outokumpu HSC® Chemistry [See Reference(26) for details]. The surface morphology was examined using a Philips XL-20 Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM).

Figure 1. SEM micrographs of the surface of a: (a) platinized nickel electrode, and (b) bulk platinum electrode. Note that the labels for the scale of the two micrographs are both 2.0um.

### **Results and Discussion**

### Surface Morphology

The surface morphology of the platinized nickel electrode and of the bulk platinum electrode were characterized using a variety of surface analysis techniques and the SEM micrographs are shown in Figure 1. It is seen that the platinized nickel electrode has a granular surface morphology, with an average grain size of around 300nm, while the polished surface of the bulk platinum electrode appears to be very smooth at the selected magnification of the microscope. Therefore, the platinized nickel electrode surface has a higher real surface area than does the bulk platinum electrode. The thickness of the electroplated layer is approximately 5um, as calculated via x-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, so that it behaves, generally, like a bulk platinum electrode (26). Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) indicates that the surface is pure polycrystalline platinum with no traces of nickel or other impurities within the detection limit ( $\sim$ 1%).

### Calculation of the Hydrogen Concentration

Since the hydrogen saturated solution in the reservoir is maintained at ambient temperature, and the solution is circulated via the flow loop, the concentration of the hydrogen on the molal scale remains the same for the reaction vessel and the loop at any temperature, provided that the solution in the loop is maintained in the liquid phase. The solubility of the slightly soluble hydrogen gas is usually described in terms of Henry's Law

$$P_{H_2} = K_{H_2} x_{H_2} {1}$$

where  $P_{H_2}$  is partial pressure of hydrogen,  $x_{H_2}$  is mole fraction of hydrogen in hydrogen saturated water, and  $K_{H_2}$  is the Henry's constant for hydrogen in water. Alternatively, the solubility oh hydrogen can also be expressed in the form

$$m_{H_2}^T = K_H^T f_{H_2}^T = K_H^{T_0} f_{H_2}^{T_0}$$
 [2]

where  $m_{H_2}^T$  (mol/kg water, or m) is the molal concentration of dissolved hydrogen in the solution,  $K_{H_2}^T$  (m/atm) is the temperature-dependent Henry's law coefficient, and  $f_{H_2}^T$  is the fugacity of hydrogen. For a single phase solution, the molal concentration of the dissolved hydrogen is independent of temperature. The Henry's law coefficient for hydrogen in water is given as(28)

$$\log(K_{H_2}^T) = \frac{1321}{T} - 10.703 + 0.010468T$$
 [3]

Therefore, at ambient temperature (298K) and at atmospheric pressure, the Henry's law coefficient is calculated to be  $7.1 \times 10^{-4}$  mol/kg·atm, and the saturated hydrogen concentration in water is  $0.7 \times 10^{-3}$  m (equivalent to 1.4ppm). In this work, hydrogen pressures of 2.61bar and 2.86bar were used in 0.1M KOH (equivalent to 0.1006m at any temperature) and 0.01M KOH (equivalent to 0.01001m at any temperature) + 0.03M K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> (equivalent to 0.03016m at any temperature) solutions, respectively. Therefore, the calculated concentrations were  $1.824 \times 10^{-3}m$  and  $2 \times 10^{-3}m$ , respectively. Note, here the unit m denotes mole per 1000g of water. The reason for usinge m instead of M is that with m, the concentration is temperature invariant. The unit conversion is implemented by Chembuddy© Concentration and Solution Calculator (CASC) software (version 1.0.1.17, copyright by BPP Marcin Borkowski 2005).

#### High Temperature Analysis

The potential sweep method was used to study the hydrogen electrode reaction on platinum over a wide temperature range, but the sweep rate was set to be very low (0.5 mV/s), in order to maintain quasi-steady state conditions. The polarization curves in 0.1006 m KOH solution at several temperatures with the impeller rotating at 400rpm are shown in Figure 2. It is seen that the hydrogen oxidation and evolution currents increase sharply at low overpotentials, and the oxidation current quickly goes to a plateau indicating the mass transfer control of the reaction. Upon further increasing of the overpotential, the reaction rate decreases exponentially with increasing voltage, resulting in the so called "inverse Tafel's Law" phenomenon(29), which can be accounted for by quantum mechanical tunneling theory in that charge carriers must tunnel across a passive oxide layer whose thickness increases linearly with the applied voltage(26,30). The passive oxide layer is the anodic oxide film of platinum.

Figure 2. Temperature dependence of the polarization curves for the hydrogen electrode reaction on platinum in 0.1006m KOH at a H<sub>2</sub> pressure of 2.61bar ( [H<sub>2</sub>] = 1.824x $10^{-3}m$ ) and at an impeller rotation rate of 400rpm, except at  $220^{\circ}$ C, where the experiment was carried out in 0.01001m KOH + 0.03016m K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> at 200rpm, and at a H<sub>2</sub> pressure of 2.86bar ([H<sub>2</sub>] = 2x $10^{-3}m$ ).

A second plateau is noticed at high overpotentials between 1.15V and 1.5V after the exponential decay of the oxidation current. This plateau is contributed from the passive current of platinum, because the tunneling current for hydrogen oxidation is gradually inhibited by the thickness of the growing platinum oxide, so that the passive current of platinum is dominating in this potential range. The potential-independent passive current of platinum agrees well with the diagnostic criteria of the point defect model (PDM)(31-33) for an n-type oxide film. Mott-Schottky analysis has demonstrated the n-type electronic character of the platinum oxide film(34). The limiting current for hydrogen oxidation and the passive current of platinum both increase as the temperature increases. It is also noted that the commencement of platinum oxidation (i.e., the down turn in the current from the plateaux) and oxygen evolution shift toward the open circuit potential of the hydrogen electrode reaction as the temperature is increased, which can be accounted for by the thermodynamics of the reactions.

It can be seen from Figure 2 that, at low overpotentials, the polarization curves at different temperatures almost overlap, which indicates that the reaction is under mixed

control of mass transport and activation (kinetic control). To obtain reliable values for the kinetic parameters, the Butler-Volmer equation was used for optimization on the experimental polarization data, taking into consideration mass transport, kinetics, and thermodynamics:

$$i = \frac{e^{\eta/b_a} - e^{-\eta/b_c}}{\frac{1}{i_0} + \frac{e^{\eta/b_a}}{i_{l,a}} - \frac{e^{-\eta/b_c}}{i_{l,c}}}$$
[4]

where  $2.303b_a$  and  $2.303b_c$  are the Tafel slopes for the HOR and the HER, respectively; and  $i_{l,a}$  and  $i_{l,c}$  are the limiting currents for the reactions. The Tafel slope is also a function of temperature and of the transfer coefficient of the reaction:

$$b_a = \frac{RT}{\alpha_a nF} \tag{5}$$

$$b_c = \frac{RT}{\alpha_c nF} \tag{6}$$

where  $\alpha_a$  and  $\alpha_c$  are the transfer coefficients of the HOR and the HER, respectively, and n is the number of electrons transferred. By optimizing equation [4] on the experimental polarization data and noting equation [5] and [6], the exchange current density and transfer coefficients of the HOR and the HER can then be extracted at each temperature. The activation energy of the hydrogen electrode reaction and the Tafel slopes of the HOR and the HER can therefore be determined from the Arrhenius plot.

Figure 3. Experimental (exp) and calculated (eqn) polarization data for the HER and the HOR on platinum in 0.1006m KOH as a function of temperature. The calculated values are estimated using Equation [4] and the parameter values are determined by optimization (Table I).

In this optimization model, current, overpotential, and limiting current of the HOR are measured values (known parameters), and temperature and number of transferred electrons are known parameters as well. The optimization algorithm is the least square root of the sum of the difference square between the measured current values and calculated current values at each temperature. Figure 3 shows both the experimental data for the hydrogen electrode reaction at several temperatures and the predicted data from the Butler-Volmer equation using the kinetic parameters obtained by optimization. It can be seen that the calculated data matches very well with the experimental data, and the extracted exchange current densities as well as the Tafel slopes are tabulated in Table I.

An Arrhenius plot of the exchange current density is shown in Figure 4. From the slope ( *RT/E#* − ), where *# E* is the activation energy. The value for this parameter is 17.3 kJ/mole, which is in good agreement with those reported in literature for bulk, polycrystalline platinum electrodes with temperatures ranging from ambient up to 70o C(5).

Table II lists the activation energies obtained in this work and that reported in literature. A comparison of these values indicates that the activation energy on the platinized nickel electrode is comparable (within the experimental error) with that for a bulk platinum electrode(5), but is lower than those observed on a sputtered platinum electrode(5) and on single crystal platinum electrodes in alkaline solutions(7). The activation energy of a platinum/nickel alloy electrode is slightly lower than both the platinized nickel electrode and the bulk platinum electrode in alkaline solutions. The hydrogen electrode reaction is faster in acid than in alkaline solutions (6,35,36). [The fact that the kinetics of the HOR on Pt is pH-dependent(37) poses a problem for the frequently proposed mechanism: the Tafel-Volmer sequence with the Tafel step as being rate-determining(6,38), and a comparison of the data in the literature also indicates that the activation energy is lower in acid than in alkaline solutions, which renders acid solutions better electrolytes for the kinetics of the hydrogen electrode reaction. However, service in acidic environments also results in harsh requirements for the electrode materials; high resistance to corrosion/dissolution.

The exchange current density extracted in this work is higher than those measured by other workers in alkaline solutions, even after correcting the hydrogen pressure to 1bar (assuming that the current density is proportional to the hydrogen concentration), as shown in Table II. A possible reason is that, although bright platinum is electroplated onto a smooth nickel surface, contrary to a polished bulk platinum electrode, the platinized nickel electrode still possesses a granular surface, as shown in Figure 1, and hence possesses a larger surface area and provides more adsorption/reaction sites for the hydrogen atoms for a given geometric plane area. The 60Pt-40Ni alloy (5) has a lower activation energy than does the platinized nickel electrode, but the advantage is greatly counteracted by the significantly lower exchange current density (8.10x10<sup>-3</sup>mA/cm<sup>2</sup> at 25°C). It therefore suggests that the platinized nickel electrode used in the present study is superior in electrocatalytic performance than the alloy and other forms of platinum electrodes.

An anomalous phenomenon is observed for the Tafel slope of the HER (hydrogen evolution reaction); that it is independent of temperature. In addition, the Tafel slope of the HOR is also not proportional to the temperature. From Equation [5] and [6], it is seen

that the Tafel slopes are expected to increase linearly with the temperature, provided that the transfer constants are indeed constant. A direct consequence of the temperature invariant Tafel slope is that the transfer coefficients are temperature dependent, as seen in Figure 5.

Figure 5. Temperature dependencies of the transfer coefficients of the HOR and the HER on platinized nickel electrode.

The most plausible explanation found in literature is that there is a compensating effect caused by the temperature-dependent entropy of activation(39). However, this contradicts the quantum mechanical tunneling nature of the charge carriers tunneling across a reaction interface(26,30,40-42). Accordingly, it is likely that the temperature dependencies of the apparent transfer coefficients of the hydrogen electrode reaction can be attributed to other factors. Thus, Kriksunov (43) derived the temperature dependence of the apparent Tafel slope for two parallel electrochemical reactions with different reaction rates and activation energies, and he was able to account for temperatureindependent Tafel slopes.

In this study, it is possible that the two parallel processes might be the two different mechanisms for the hydrogen electrode reaction and that they are occurring on different crystal facets of the electrode surface. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis may resolve this issue, but due to time and space limitation, this work is not discussed here.

### **Conclusions**

This work was carried out to explore the kinetics of the hydrogen electrode reaction on platinum in alkaline solutions over a range of temperatures extending from ambient to 220o C. Kinetic parameters are extracted by optimizing the Butler-Volmer equation on the polarization curves of the hydrogen electrode reaction. The exchange current density of the hydrogen electrode reaction on the platinized nickel electrode is higher than the values reported in literature on other forms of platinum electrodes, probably due to the platinized nickel electrode having a granular surface morphology that increases the real surface area and hence increases the density of adsorption/desorption sites for the reaction per unit geometric plane area. The activation energy of 17.3kJ/mol, obtained in this work from the Arrhenius plot of the exchange current density, is also comparable with that for a bulk platinum electrode, but is lower than those for sputtered platinum and single crystal platinum electrodes in alkaline solutions. The apparent Tafel slope of the hydrogen evolution reaction is found to be temperature independent, of which, the most probable cause is that two parallel reactions with different activation energies and transfer coefficients are occurring on the electrode surface.

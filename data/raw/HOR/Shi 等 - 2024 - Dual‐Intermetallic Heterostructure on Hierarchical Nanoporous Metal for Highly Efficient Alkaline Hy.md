**Constructing well-defined active multisites is an effective strategy to break linear scaling relationships to develop high-efficiency catalysts toward multiple-intermediate reactions. Here, dual-intermetallic heterostructure composed of tungsten-bridged Co3W and WNi4 intermetallic compounds seamlessly integrated on hierarchical nanoporous nickel skeleton is reported as a high-performance nonprecious electrocatalyst for alkaline hydrogen evolution and oxidation reactions. By virtue of interfacial tungsten atoms configuring contiguous multisites with proper adsorptions of hydrogen and hydroxyl intermediates to accelerate water dissociation/combination and column-nanostructured nickel skeleton facilitating electron and ion/molecule transportations, nanoporous nickel-supported Co3W–WNi4 heterostructure exhibits exceptional hydrogen electrocatalysis in alkaline media, with outstanding durability and impressive catalytic activities for hydrogen oxidation reaction (geometric exchange current density of ≈6.62 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2) and hydrogen evolution reaction (current density of ≈1.45 A cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> at overpotential of 200 mV). Such atom-ordered intermetallic heterostructure alternative to platinum group metals shows genuine potential for hydrogen production and utilization in hydroxide-exchange-membrane water electrolyzers and fuel cells.**

membrane water electrolyzers (HEMWEs) and fuel cells (HEM-FCs) emerge as more attractive energy conversion technologies because of less corrosive alkaline environments, which allow for using cost-effective PGM-free electrocatalysts in addition to lowcost membranes, bipolar plates, and other components.[\[8–10,15–17\]](#page-10-0) However, the alkaline medium also brings great challenges for the development of HEMWEs and HEMFCs primarily because alkaline HER/HOR undergo sluggish reaction kinetics in the multistep electrochemical processes, including water dissociation/formation and adsorption/combination of reactive hydrogen (H\*) and hydroxyl (OH\*) intermediates.[\[7,11,18–20\]](#page-9-0) Even mediated by PGMs (e.g., Pt, Ir, Pd, and Rh) with proper hydrogen binding energies (HBEs), the reaction rates of HER/HOR are two or three orders of magnitude lower in base than in acid.[\[11,21,22\]](#page-10-0) This is due to linear scaling relationships of single-site catalysts that govern incongruous adsorptions of H\* and OH\* for lowefficiency water dissociation/formation,[\[11,21–24\]](#page-10-0) which highlights urgent demands for constructing multisites in electrocatalytic materials to accelerate alkaline HER/OER kinetics. Meanwhile, ideal electrocatalytic materials in HEMWEs and HEMFCs should

also have versatile architectures to guarantee sufficient access to high catalytic active sites as well as electron and ion transport pathways in view that the gas-involving electrocatalysis occurs at triple-phase interfaces only when electron and ion/molecule contact at the active sites.[\[6,19–22,25\]](#page-9-0) Although judicious engineering of PGM-based alloys[\[26,27\]](#page-10-0) and PGM/oxide,[\[28,29\]](#page-10-0) hydroxide[\[20,30\]](#page-10-0) or sulfide heterostructures[\[20,21\]](#page-10-0) could satisfy these multifunctional requirements and significantly improve the alkaline HER/HOR performance, their scarcity and high cost substantially impede the practical use in widespread commercialization of HEMWEs and HEMFCs.[\[6,21,22,31,32\]](#page-9-0) To develop more cost-effective electrocatalysts, considerable research efforts have been devoted to the development of PGM-free ones, typically based on lowcost and earth-abundant Ni due to its suitable adsorption energies of HER/HOR intermediates and high corrosion resistance in alkaline environments.[\[8,10\]](#page-10-0) These include Ni-based solid-solution alloys (e.g., NiFe, NiCu, NiCo, NiMo, NiW, Ni-MoCo, NiWCu),[\[32–34\]](#page-10-0) compounds (e.g., Ni3N, NiS0.5Se0.5) [\[35,36\]](#page-10-0) or their hybrids (such as Ni3N/C, MoNi4/MoO2@Ni, Ni/Ni(OH)2, -NiMoO4, Ni3N@MoS2).[\[37–41\]](#page-10-0) Most of them indeed exhibit more or less enhanced alkaline HER/HOR electrocatalytic activity compared with monometallic Ni. Nevertheless, these solidsolution alloys usually encounter elemental partition and are thermodynamically prone to coarsen via low-barrier-energy atom diffusion.[\[32,38\]](#page-10-0) While for the Ni-based compounds with low electrical conductivity, they exhibit insufficient alkaline HER/HOR electrocatalytic performance, particularly for the ones made of low-dimensional nanostructures that have to be immobilized on current collectors by making use of insulative polymer binder to maintain electric contact.[\[31,37,42,43\]](#page-10-0) In general, these nanocatalysts stack densely and superinduce additional high-contactresistance interfaces, which not only lower accessibility of electroactive sites but also limit electron transfer and ion/molecule transportation during the HER/HOR.[\[7,22,31,44\]](#page-9-0) Therefore, it is imperative to design more efficient PGM-free electrocatalysts based on earth-abundant and nonprecious metals.

Considering thermodynamically stable intermetallic compounds as ideal platform materials to explore high-performance electrocatalysts by making use of their stoichiometric heterogeneous components to construct well-defined active multisites and strong covalent bonds to suppress interatom diffusion and interparticle aggregation,[\[45–48\]](#page-10-0) here we report selfsupported nanoporous hybrid electrodes that are composed of a dual-intermetallic heterostructure of Co3W and WNi4 intermetallic compound nanoparticles seamlessly integrated on hierarchical nickel skeleton (Co3W–WNi4/Ni) as impressive nonprecious electrocatalytic materials towards both HER and HOR in alkaline media. Owing to interfacial tungsten atoms to bridge Co3W and WNi4 intermetallic compounds, there configure welldefined contiguous Co–Ni–Co and Co–W–Co multisites for distinct adsorptions of H\* and OH\* with proper binding energies, which substantially boost water dissociation and combination during the alkaline HER/HOR. As a consequence of hierarchical nanoporous Ni skeleton to facilitate electron transfer and ion/molecule transport as well as high accessibility of multi-sites, the self-supported nanoporous Co3W–WNi4/Ni electrode exhibits high HOR current density of ≈31.43 mA cmgeo<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> along with geometric exchange current density of ≈6.62 mA cmgeo<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> and remains activity even up to ≈0.35 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) in 0.1 m KOH electrolyte. When working as the HER electrocatalysts, the nanoporous Co3W–WNi4/Ni electrode only takes the overpotential of 200 mV to reach current density of as high as 1.45 A cmgeo<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> in 1 m KOH, more than 3- and 13-fold higher than those of nanoporous Ni supported intermetallic WNi4 (WNi4/Ni) and solid-solution CoNi alloy (CoNi/Ni), respectively. Furthermore, it maintains exceptional stability during the long-term durability test for over 1000 h. These impressive electrochemical properties enable the nanoporous Co3W–WNi4/Ni electrode to outperform some of the best nonprecious HER/HOR catalysts and show genuine potential as an attractive alternative to PGMs for hydrogen production and utilization in HEMWEs and HEMFCs.

# **2. Results and Discussion**

The self-supported monolithic nanoporous Co3W–WNi4/Ni hybrid electrode is prepared by a facile and scalable alloying/dealloying strategy (**Figure 1**[a\)](#page-2-0). Briefly, precursor alloy of quasi-eutectic-composition Ni10Co6W4Al80 (at%) is first produced by arc-melting pure Al, Ni, Co, and W metals with an atomic ratio of 80:10:6:4 and then melting-spinning into ≈80 μm thick ribbons in an argon atmosphere (Figure S1, Supporting Information). During the cooling process, there takes place eutectic solidification reaction to form a columnar multiphase microstructure mainly composed of immiscible -Al and intermetallic Al3Ni phases,[\[49\]](#page-10-0) in addition to nanoscale precipitations of intermetallic Co3W–WNi4 heterostructure (Figures S2 and S3, Supporting Information). Such multiphase structure enables the formation of hierarchical columnar nanoporous architecture when selectively etching the -Al phase as well as the less-noble Al component in intermetallic Al3Ni during the chemical dealloying procedure in 6 m KOH solution. Meanwhile, the precipitated Co3W–WNi4 heterostructure nanoparticles are spontaneously separated and in situ anchored on the Ni ligaments (Figure [1b\)](#page-2-0). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis attests the presence of Co and W, in addition to Ni skeleton with residual Al (Figure S4, Supporting Information). The atomic ratio of Ni, Co, and W is determined to be 59:30:4 by X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) (Figure S5, Supporting Information) and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) measurements. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of nanoporous Co3W–WNi4/Ni electrode demonstrate the hybrid structure, with two sets of diffraction patterns at 2 = 40.8°, 43.9°, 46.5°, 48.6° and 43.5°, 50.3°, 51.4° corresponding to the (200), (002), (201), (102) planes of hexagonal Co3W (JCPDS 02-1298)[\[50\]](#page-10-0) and the (211), (130), (002) planes of tetragonal WNi4 intermetallic (JCPDS 65-2673),[\[51\]](#page-10-0) respectively, in addition to the ones assigned to face-centered cubic (fcc) Ni phase (JCPDS 04-0850) (Figure [1c\)](#page-2-0). Figure [1d](#page-2-0) shows a representative scanning electron microscope (SEM) image of nanoporous Co3W–WNi4/Ni electrode, displaying a hierarchical nanoporous architecture consisting of ≈100 nm channels and ≈5 nm nanopores in Ni columns (Figure S6, Supporting Information), which results from the selective etching of -Al phase and the less-noble Al component from intermetallic Al3Ni, respectively. Scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) image of nanoporous Co3W– WNi4/Ni column and its corresponding EDS elemental mappings illustrate the uniform distributions of Co and W atoms

along the Ni skeleton (Figure 1e) as a result of the incorporation of high-density Co3W–WNi4 heterostructure nanoparticles with diameter of ≈4 nm, as demonstrated by high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) image (Figure 1f). In a magnified atomic-resolution HRTEM image of Co3W–WNi4/Ni interfacial region (Figure 1g), the interplanar spacings of 0.206, 0.208, and 0.203 nm correspond to the lattice planes of hexagonal Co3W(002), tetragonal WNi4(211) and fcc Ni(111), respectively, which are identified by their fast Fourier transform (FFT) patterns (Figure 1h–j). Although they are of distinct crystallographic structures, there does not observe evident interface between Co3W and WNi4 viewed along their *<*2110*>* and *<*120*>* zone axis. This implies the indispensable role of W in bridging Co3W and WNi4 to configure dual-intermetallic heterostructure with a coherent interface. For comparison, nanoporous WNi4/Ni, Co3W/Co, CoNi/Ni, and pure Ni electrodes are also prepared by

the same alloying/dealloying procedure illustrated in Figure [1a.](#page-2-0) As shown in Figure S7 (Supporting Information), they have alike hierarchical nanoporous architectures as a result of selective etching of less-noble Al components from their multiphasenanostructured precursor alloys of Ni20<sup>−</sup>*x*−*y*Co*x*W*y*Al80 (*x* = 0, 6 or/and *y* = 0, 4) (Figure S1, Supporting Information).

**Figure 2**a–c shows high-resolution Ni 2p, Co 2p, and W 4f XPS spectra of nanoporous Co3W–WNi4/Ni electrode. Obviously, these elements present primarily in metallic states corresponding to the internal Ni, Co, and W atoms in both Co3W–WNi4 dual-intermetallic heterostructure and Ni ligament,[\[38,52,53\]](#page-10-0) except for little oxidized species deriving from inevitable surface oxidation or adsorption of hydroxyl groups. As shown in Figure 2a, the Ni 2p3/2 and Ni 2p1/2 signals are deconvoluted into two pairs of Ni<sup>0</sup> 2p and Ni<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> 2p at the binding energies of 852.9 eV/870.0 eV and 853.9 eV/871.0 eV, respectively, except for satellite peaks.[\[38,49\]](#page-10-0) In the Co 2p XPS spectrum, there are three pairs of characteristic peaks at the binding energies of 778.4 eV/793.3 eV, 779.8 eV/794.8 eV and 782.0 eV/797.0 eV, which correspond to the Co0 2p3/2/Co0 2p1/2, Co3<sup>+</sup> 2p3/2/Co3<sup>+</sup> 2p1/2 and Co2<sup>+</sup> 2p3/2/Co2<sup>+</sup> 2p1/2 (Figure 2b).[\[49,52\]](#page-10-0) As for the W 4f XPS spectrum (Figure 2c), the characteristic peaks at 31.7 eV/33.9 eV and 35.9/38.0 eV are attributed to W<sup>0</sup> 4f7/2/W0 4f5/2 and W6<sup>+</sup> 4f7/2/W0 4f7/2, respectively.[\[51,53\]](#page-10-0) Figure 2d compares the Ni0 2p3/2 XPS spectra of nanoporous electrodes. Evidently, the characteristic peak of nanoporous WNi4/Ni (852.8 eV) shifts to a higher binding energy relative to that of nanoporous CoNi/Ni (852.6 eV) or bare Ni (852.4 eV). This results from the electron transfer from less electronegative Ni to more electronegative W due to the formation of W–Ni covalent bonds in intermetallic WNi4. A similar phenomenon is also observed in Co<sup>0</sup> 2p XPS spectrum because of the formation of intermetallic Co3W. As shown in Figure 2e, the binding energy of Co0 2p3/2 peak of nanoporous Co3W/Co electrode is higher than that of nanoporous Co electrode (778.0 eV) due to the electron transfer from Co to W triggered by their electronegativity difference. The Co<sup>0</sup> 2p3/2 peak of nanoporous Co3W–WNi4/Ni electrode (778.4 eV) also exhibits a positive shift compared with that of nanoporous CoNi/Ni (778.2 eV). When incorporating intermetallic Co3W, there forms the dual-intermetallic Co3W–WNi4 heterostructure to enhance the electron transfer from Ni to W, as demonstrated by the further increase of the Ni<sup>0</sup> 2p3/2 binding energy in nanoporous Co3W–WNi4/Ni compared with that in nanoporous WNi4/Ni (Figure 2d). This is also attested by the obviously negative shift of W0 4f7/2 peak in nanoporous Co3W–WNi4/Ni relative to that in nanoporous WNi4/Ni (Figure 2f), which is due to W atoms in nanoporous Co3W–WNi4/Ni obtaining more electrons than those in nanoporous WNi4/Ni and Co3W/Co. These observations

demonstrate the strong electron interactions among Ni, Co, and W via the formation of Co<sub>3</sub>W and WNi<sub>4</sub> intermetallic compounds and their heterostructure at Co–W–Ni alloy interface, which not only generate abundant active multisites but also enable modulation of HBE and hydroxide binding energy (OHBE) for highefficient alkaline hydrogen electrocatalysis.

To evaluate the alkaline hydrogen electrocatalysis, all selfsupported nanoporous electrode materials are directly used as the working electrodes for electrochemical measurements, which are performed in a classical three-electrode setup with a graphite rod as the counter electrode and an Ag/AgCl electrode as the reference electrode. All potentials are iR-corrected and calibrated with respect to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) (Figure S8, Supporting Information).

electrode. Among five nanoporous electrodes with the almost same hierarchical nanoporous architecture, the nanoporous Co<sub>3</sub>W-WNi<sub>4</sub>/Ni electrode exhibits the highest HOR current density. As shown in Figure 3b, the nanoporous Co<sub>3</sub>W-WNi<sub>4</sub>/Ni reaches a diffusion-limiting HOR current density of ≈31.43 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> and sustains activation up to the potential of 0.35 V versus RHE, much higher than those of nanoporous WNi₄/Ni (≈19.95 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, 0.24 V), CoNi/Ni (≈22.25 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, 0.29 V) and Ni ( $\approx 13.67$  mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, 0.23 V). More five nanoporous Co<sub>3</sub>W-WNi<sub>4</sub>/Ni electrodes also exhibit almost the same HOR polarization curves, indicating the excellent reproducibility of alloying/dealloying strategy to develop nanoporous electrodes (Figure S9, Supporting Information). In the micropolarization regions between -5 and 5 mV versus RHE, the exchange current densities (j<sub>0</sub>) of nanoporous Co<sub>3</sub>W-WNi<sub>4</sub>/Ni, WNi<sub>4</sub>/Ni, Co<sub>3</sub>W/Co, CoNi/Ni and Ni electrodes are determined to be  $\approx$ 6.62,  $\approx$ 3.35,  $\approx$ 3.83,  $\approx$ 2.08 and  $\approx$ 2.06 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, respectively (Figure S10, Supporting Information). These properties imply the significant role of dual-intermetallic Co<sub>3</sub>W-WNi<sub>4</sub> heterostructure in improving electrocatalytic HOR activity and electrooxidation tolerance of Ni-based materials and enlist the nanoporous Co<sub>3</sub>W-WNi<sub>4</sub>/Ni electrode to outperform some of the best Ni-based HOR electrocatalysts in the plot of breakdown potential and the  $i_0$  value (Figure 3c).[32,49,54-56] To assess the intrinsic activity of these nanoporous electrodes, their electrochemical surface areas (EC-SAs) are assessed according to the double-layer capacitances that are measured by cycling voltammetry (CV) method (Figure S11, Supporting Information). With an assumption that the geometric current density of nanoporous Co<sub>3</sub>W-WNi<sub>4</sub>/Ni electrode arises from electroactive sites of Co<sub>3</sub>W-WNi<sub>4</sub> and Co-doped Ni skeleton, the intrinsic activity of dual-intermetallic Co<sub>3</sub>W-WNi<sub>4</sub> is evaluated to be  $\approx 15.87 \ \mu A \ cm_{ECSA}^{-2}$  at the potential of 150 mV,  $\approx$ 2.5-,  $\approx$ 3.9- and  $\approx$ 5.3-fold higher those of intermetallic WNi<sub>4</sub> ( $\approx$ 6.34  $\mu$ A cm<sub>ECSA</sub><sup>-2</sup>), Co<sub>3</sub>W ( $\approx$ 4.11  $\mu$ A cm<sub>ECSA</sub><sup>-2</sup>) and solidsolution alloy CoNi ( $\approx 3.02 \, \mu A \, cm_{ECSA}^{-2}$ ), respectively (Figure 3d). The mass activity of dual-intermetallic Co<sub>3</sub>W-WNi<sub>4</sub> heterostructure reaches  $\approx 12.0 \text{ mA mg}^{-1}$ , higher than those of intermetallic WNi<sub>4</sub> and Co<sub>3</sub>W, as well as solid-solution alloy CoNi (Figure S12, Supporting Information).

To analyze the HOR mechanism of nanoporous Co<sub>3</sub>W-WNi<sub>4</sub>/Ni electrode, it is crushed and mixed with carbon black to prepare catalyst ink and then cast on the rotating disk electrode (RDE) for electrochemical measurements. Figure 3e shows the typical HOR polarization curve of nanoporous Co<sub>3</sub>W-WNi<sub>4</sub>/Ni RDE in H<sub>2</sub>-saturated 0.1 M KOH at a rotating speed of 1600 rpm, comparing with those of nanoporous WNi<sub>4</sub>/Ni, CoNi/Ni and Ni RDEs. Owing to the presence of high-intrinsic-activity Co<sub>3</sub>W-WNi<sub>4</sub> heterostructure, the nanoporous Co<sub>3</sub>W-WNi<sub>4</sub>/Ni delivers a HOR current density of  $\approx 3.37$  mA cm<sub>disk</sub><sup>-2</sup> at the potential of 100 mV, much higher than those of WNi<sub>4</sub>/Ni ( $\approx$ 1.57 mA cm<sub>disk</sub><sup>-2</sup>) and CoNi/Ni ( $\approx 1.32$  mA cm<sub>disk</sub><sup>-2</sup>). When performed at different rotating speeds, the anodic current density of nanoporous Co<sub>3</sub>W-WNi<sub>4</sub>/Ni increases with the increase of the rotating speed (Figure S13, Supporting Information), demonstrating the H<sub>2</sub> diffusion-controlled kinetics. Figure 3f shows the fitting of current density at 150 mV versus RHE using the Koutecky-Levich equation, [11,12] where the slope of 4.64 cm<sup>2</sup> mA<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1/2</sup> approximate to the theoretical value of 4.87 cm<sup>2</sup> mA<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1/2</sup> for a typical two-electron HOR process (inset of Figure 3f). [57,58] Moreover,

 ${
m Co_3W-WNi_4/Ni}$  electrode undertakes a high kinetic current density  $(j_{\rm k})$  of  $\approx$ 0.85 mA cm<sub>disk</sub><sup>-2</sup> at the potential of 10 mV (Figure 3g), outperforming Ni-based HOR electrocatalysts reported recently (Figure 3h).<sup>[32,59-61]</sup>

To investigate the HOR durability of self-supported nanoporous Co<sub>3</sub>W-WNi<sub>4</sub>/Ni electrode, the accelerated stability test is further performed by continuous potential cycling between -0.2 and 0.2 V versus RHE in a H<sub>2</sub>-saturated 0.1 м КОН electrolyte. Figure 3i shows the representative HOR polarization curves of nanoporous Co<sub>3</sub>W-WNi<sub>4</sub>/Ni electrodes before and after the accelerated stability test for 4000 cycles. There does not observe evident deactivation except for the slight reduction of ≈3% in current density, in sharp contrast with the nanoporous CoNi/Ni electrode, which encounters not only current density decay of ≈40% but also deactivation potential reduction to 0.25 from 0.29 V versus RHE. The distinguished durability reflects the superior structure stability and electrooxidation tolerance of dual-intermetallic Co<sub>3</sub>W-WNi<sub>4</sub> heterostructure. As illustrated by representative STEM-EDS images (Figure S14, Supporting Information) and XRD patterns (Figure S15, Supporting Information) of nanoporous Co<sub>3</sub>W-WNi<sub>4</sub>/Ni electrode after the stability test, [50,51] it still maintains the original nanoporous microstructure composed of electroactive dual-intermetallic Co<sub>3</sub>W-WNi<sub>4</sub> and Ni skeleton as a result of strong Co-W and Ni-W covalent bonds significantly suppressing the evolution of Co, W, and Ni atoms. The outstanding HOR durability of nanoporous Co<sub>3</sub>W-WNi<sub>4</sub>/Ni electrode is further demonstrated by ICP-OES analysis of electrolyte after the cycling test, where there are negligible Ni, Co, W, and Al ions (Table S1, Supporting Information).

The alkaline HER electrocatalytic performance of nanoporous Co<sub>3</sub>W-WNi<sub>4</sub>/Ni electrodes is investigated in 1 м KOH solution (Figure \$16, Supporting Information). Figure 4a shows a typical HER polarization curve of Co<sub>3</sub>W-WNi<sub>4</sub>/Ni electrode, compared with those of nanoporous WNi<sub>4</sub>/Ni, Co<sub>3</sub>W/Co, CoNi/Ni, and bare Ni electrodes, as well as that of commercially available Pt/C catalyst immobilized on nanoporous Ni current collector (Pt/C/Ni). Owing to the presence of dual-intermetallic Co<sub>3</sub>W-WNi4 heterostructure nanoparticles that work as the electroactive multisites to boost water dissociation and subsequent adsorption/combination of H\*, the nanoporous Co<sub>3</sub>W-WNi<sub>4</sub>/Ni electrode exhibits a remarkably enhanced HER electrocatalysis. It only takes a low overpotential of ≈55 mV to reach 100 mA cm<sub>geo</sub><sup>-2</sup>, in contrast to nanoporous Co<sub>3</sub>W/Co (≈85 mV), WNi<sub>4</sub>/Ni (≈106 mV), CoNi/Ni (≈195 mV), and bare Ni electrodes (≈218 mV). At the overpotentials of >150 mV, the hydrogen evolution with ampere-level current density can be realized on nanoporous Co<sub>3</sub>W-WNi<sub>4</sub>/Ni electrode. As shown in Figure 4a, the current density of nanoporous Co<sub>3</sub>W–WNi<sub>4</sub>/Ni reaches ≈1.45 A cm<sup>-2</sup> at -200 mV, more than 2-, 3-, and 13-fold higher than those of nanoporous  $Co_3W/Co$  ( $\approx 0.78$  A cm<sup>-2</sup>),  $WNi_4/Ni$  ( $\approx 0.45$  A cm<sup>-2</sup>), and CoNi/Ni ( $\approx 0.11$  A cm<sup>-2</sup>), respectively (Figure 4b). This value is even  $\approx$ 0.60 A cm<sup>-2</sup> higher than that of nanoporous  $Pt/C/Ni~(\approx 0.85~A~cm^{-2})$  although Pt is generally considered to be the best HER catalyst.<sup>[7,11,19]</sup> The outstanding reaction kinetics of nanoporous Co<sub>3</sub>W-WNi<sub>4</sub>/Ni electrode is also revealed by its ultralow Tafel slope of  $\approx$ 42 mV dec<sup>-1</sup> (Figure 4c). With an assumption that the geometric current density of nanoporous Co<sub>3</sub>W-WNi<sub>4</sub>/Ni electrode results from both Ni ligaments and

electroactive sites of dual-intermetallic Co3W–WNi4 heterostructure nanoparticles, the intrinsic HER activity of Co3W–WNi4 heterostructure is evaluated to be ≈1.38 mA cmECSA<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> at the overpotential of 200 mV, much higher than monointermetallic Co3W (≈0.52 mA cmECSA<sup>−</sup>2), WNi4 (≈0.51 mA cmECSA<sup>−</sup>2) and solid-solution CoNi alloy (≈0.04 mA cmECSA<sup>−</sup>2) (Figure 4d), as well as representative electrocatalysts reported recently (Table S2, Supporting Information). Based on the loading mass of dualintermetallic Co3W–WNi4 (2.25 mg cm<sup>−</sup>2), the mass activity of dual-intermetallic Co3W–WNi4 heterostructure is calculated to be ≈596 mA mg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> (Figure S17, Supporting Information). The distinct alkaline HER electrocatalytic properties of nanoporous Co3W–WNi4/Ni, WNi4/Ni, Co3W/Co, CoNi/Ni, and Ni electrodes are further demonstrated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis. In the Nyquist plots (Figure 4e), their EIS spectra show two characteristic semicircles in the

middle- to low-frequency range, corresponding to the charge transfer resistance (*R*CT) and the pore resistance (*R*P) in parallel with their constant phase elements (CPEs), while the intercept on the real axis at the high frequencies represents the intrinsic resistance (*R*I) of electrode and electrolyte.[\[49,62\]](#page-10-0) In terms of the equivalent circuit with these general descriptors (inset of Figure [4e\)](#page-6-0), the *R*CT value of nanoporous Co3W–WNi4/Ni electrode is determined to be ≈1.9 Ω, lower than those of nanoporous Co3W/Co (≈3.2 Ω), WNi4/Ni (≈5.0 Ω), CoNi/Ni (≈41.2 Ω) and Ni (≈43.4 Ω) electrodes (Figure S18, Supporting Information). Moreover, the nanoporous Co3W–WNi4/Ni exhibits excellent stability during ultralong electrolysis test performed in 1 m KOH electrolyte at the overpotential of 100 mV for over 1000 h. As shown in Figure [4f,](#page-6-0) there does not observe evident fluctuation at the corresponding current density of ≈420 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2, different from the nanoporous CoNi/Ni electrode, of which the current density dramatically attenuates by ≈36% only in 200 h. The STEM image and the corresponding EDS elemental mappings illustrate that the tested nanoporous Co3W–WNi4/Ni electrode always retains initial nanoporous architecture composed of uniform electroactive dual-intermetallic Co3W–WNi4 on Ni ligament (inset of Figure [4f](#page-6-0) and Figure S19, Supporting Information). Furthermore, there are negligible Ni, Co, W, and Al ions to be detected by ICP-OES in the tested electrolyte (Table S3, Supporting Information). These impressive electrochemical properties indicate that nanoporous Co3W– WNi4/Ni electrode is also one of the most attractive electrocatalysts for the alkaline HER (Figure [4g](#page-6-0) and Table S4, Supporting Information).[\[19–22\]](#page-10-0) To demonstrate the practical use in water electrolysis, an alkaline-water electrolyzer is constructed with the nanoporous Co3W–WNi4/Ni as the cathode and the nanoporous Ni-supported commercial RuO2 (RuO2/Ni) as the anode (Co3W– WNi4/Ni||RuO2/Ni) (Figure [4h\)](#page-6-0). Figure [4i](#page-6-0) shows a typical water– electrolysis polarization curve of Co3W–WNi4/Ni||RuO2/Ni in

1 m KOH, compared with that of the electrolyzer assembled with the nanoporous Ni-supported commercial Pt/C (Pt/C/Ni) as the cathode and the RuO2/Ni as the anode (Pt/C/Ni||RuO2/Ni). Obviously, the Co3W–WNi4/Ni||RuO2/Ni can deliver ampere-level current density of ≈1.8 A cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> at the voltage of 2.2 V, outperforming the Pt/C/Ni||RuO2/Ni (≈0.4 A cm<sup>−</sup>2).

To illustrate the intrinsic mechanism for the exceptional alkaline hydrogen electrocatalysis of nanoporous Co3W–WNi4/Ni, operando EIS analysis and kinetic isotope effect (KIE) experiments are conducted to analyze their hydrogen and hydroxide adsorption kinetics at different HER/HOR potentials. In the Bode phase plots (Figure S20a–c, Supporting Information), there display distinct impedance features in low-frequency region among nanoporous Co3W–WNi4/Ni, WNi4/Ni and CoNi/Ni electrodes, reflecting their different hydrogen adsorption behaviors,[\[28,63\]](#page-10-0) which can be quantitatively analyzed by fitting the Nyquist plots based on a double-parallel equivalent circuit (Figure S20d–f, Supporting Information). Therein, the second parallel component *R*H\* represents the H\* adsorption resistance (inset of Figure S20d, Supporting Information).[\[28,64\]](#page-10-0) In the EIS-derived Tafel plots of log*R*H\* versus potential (**Figure 5**a), the nanoporous Co3W–WNi4/Ni has the lowest hydrogen adsorption resistances at various potentials no matter in HER or HOR, indicating the fastest hydrogen adsorption and transfer kinetics.[\[64,65\]](#page-11-0) Figure S21 (Supporting Information) shows the polarization curves of nanoporous Co3W–WNi4/Ni, WNi4/Ni, and CoNi/Ni electrodes in 0.1 m NaOH aqueous electrolyte and 0.1 m NaOD D2O electrolyte. All nanoporous electrodes exhibit inferior HOR activity in NaOD D2O electrolyte compared with in NaOH aqueous electrolyte, suggesting the strong dependence of HOR performance on OHBE.[\[66,67\]](#page-11-0) Figure 5b shows the KIE values that are calculated according to current density ratios from H2O and D2O electrolytes (*J*OH/*J*OD) at different HER/HOR potentials.[\[28,68\]](#page-10-0)

Owing to the enhanced OHBE on  $\text{Co}_3\text{W}\text{-WNi}_4$  heterostructure, the activity of nanoporous  $\text{Co}_3\text{W}\text{-WNi}_4/\text{Ni}$  has the KIE of 1.4–1.9 in the HER/HOR potential of -15–30 mV, less than those of nanoporous  $\text{WNi}_4/\text{Ni}$  (2.3–3.5) and CoNi/Ni (2.6–3.6) electrodes (Figure 5b), inferring faster water formation and dissociation kinetics on dual-intermetallic heterostructure  $\text{Co}_3\text{W}\text{-WNi}_4.^{[68,69]}$ 

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations are further carried out on dual-intermetallic heterostructure model that is built with Co<sub>3</sub>W and WNi<sub>4</sub> bridged by W atoms. Figure S22 (Supporting Information) displays the projected density of states (PDOS) of interfacial W, Co, and Ni atoms, with evident d orbital overlaps to attest the strongly coupled interaction between Co<sub>3</sub>W and WNi<sub>4</sub>. As illustrated by the charge density difference mapping of Co<sub>3</sub>W-WNi<sub>4</sub> heterostructure interface (Figure 5c), there appears obvious electron accumulation. Such unique atom-ordered Co-W-Ni alloy interface enables contiguous Co-Ni-Co and Co-W-Co multisites for distinct adsorption behaviours of H\* and OH\*. Compared with individual WNi4 and Co3W intermetallic compounds and CoNi solid-solution alloy (Figures S23–S25, Supporting Information), the dual-intermetallic Co<sub>3</sub>W-WNi<sub>4</sub> heterostructure can reduce the HBE of interfacial Co-Ni-Co hollow sites to -0.17 eV and increase the OHBE of interfacial Co-W-Co hollow sites to -1.29 eV (Figure 5d), substantially boosting the alkaline hydrogen electrocatalysis kinetics. Figure 5e compares the alkaline HER/HOR reaction pathways mediated by Co<sub>3</sub>W-WNi<sub>4</sub> intermetallic heterostructure and individual WNi<sub>4</sub> and Co<sub>3</sub>W intermetallic compounds, following the general Tafel-Volmer mechanism for HOR.[11,16] Figure S26 (Supporting Information) illustrates the atomic configurations of multiple intermediates on Co<sub>3</sub>W-WNi<sub>4</sub> intermetallic heterostructure during the alkaline HOR. There first takes place the H<sub>2</sub> dissociation at the Co<sub>3</sub>W-WNi<sub>4</sub> interfacial region to generate H\* intermediates, which thermodynamically prefer to absorb on the Co-Ni-Co and Ni-Ni-Ni hollow sites, respectively. Subsequently, the H\* on Co-Ni–Co hollow site is to combine with the neighboring OH\* on Co-W-Co hollow site to form H<sub>2</sub>O, followed by the combination of the residual H\* on Ni-Ni-Ni hollow site and the OH\* on Ni-W-Ni hollow site into H2O. Therein, the Co3W-WNi4 intermetallic heterostructure suffers from the rate-determining step (RDS) of the water formation with the reaction free energy of ≈0.56 eV, different from the individual Co<sub>3</sub>W and WNi<sub>4</sub>, on which the RDS switches to the water desorption with the reaction free energies of ≈0.86 and ≈0.93 eV, respectively. Evidently, the Co<sub>3</sub>W-WNi<sub>4</sub> intermetallic heterostructure with interfacial multisites can remarkably boost HOR reaction kinetics by reducing the reaction free energy of water formation. During the alkaline HER, the Co<sub>3</sub>W–WNi<sub>4</sub> intermetallic heterostructure undergoes the RDS of the OH\* desorption with the reaction free energy of ≈0.73 eV, distinguished from the individual Co<sub>3</sub>W and WNi<sub>4</sub> intermetallic compounds, on which the H<sub>2</sub> formation with the reaction free energies of  $\approx 1.42$  and  $\approx 1.11$  eV becomes the RDS. Besides, the Co<sub>3</sub>W-WNi<sub>4</sub> intermetallic heterostructure also facilitates the water dissociation with the energy barrier of  $\approx 0.51$ eV that is much lower than individual Co<sub>3</sub>W (≈0.63 eV) and WNi<sub>4</sub> ( $\approx$ 0.76 eV) (Figure S27, Supporting Information). Therefore, such atom-ordered dual-intermetallic heterostructure not only creates multisites to break linear scaling relationships but also regulates their adsorption energies to realize favorable adsorption/desorption of different intermediates for multiple reactants/intermediates/products.

## 3. Conclusions

In summary, we have constructed intermetallic heterostructure composed of Co<sub>3</sub>W and WNi<sub>4</sub> on a hierarchical columnar nanoporous Ni skeleton as high-efficiency nonprecious electrocatalyst for alkaline hydrogen evolution and oxidation reactions. The atom-ordered intermetallic Co<sub>3</sub>W and WNi<sub>4</sub> share their W atoms to form stable dual-intermetallic Co<sub>3</sub>W–WNi<sub>4</sub> heterostructure and configure well-defined interfacial Co-Ni-Co and Co-W-Co multisites for proper adsorption behaviors of hydrogen and hydroxide intermediates, which significantly reduce the reaction barriers and tremendously accelerate the alkaline hydrogen electrocatalysis kinetics. Associated with the hierarchical columnar nanoporous architecture which guarantees full accessibility of highly electroactive Co<sub>3</sub>W-WNi<sub>4</sub> heterostructure interface, and fast electron transfer and ion/molecule mass transportation, the self-supported nanoporous Co<sub>3</sub>W-WNi<sub>4</sub>/Ni exhibits impressive alkaline HOR/HER electrocatalysis. When mediating the alkaline HOR in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte, the nanoporous Co<sub>3</sub>W-WNi₄/Ni yields the geometric current density of ≈31.43 mA cm<sub>geo</sub><sup>-2</sup>, along with high geometric exchange current density of  $\approx$ 6.62 mA cm<sub>ee0</sub><sup>-2</sup> and high deactivation potential of up to  $\approx$ 0.35 V versus RHE. While working as the HER electrocatalyst, the nanoporous Co<sub>3</sub>W-WNi<sub>4</sub>/Ni takes the overpotential of as low as 150 mV to reach ampere-level current density and maintains exceptional stability for 1000 h in 1 м КОН. The outstanding electrochemical performance makes nanoporous Co<sub>3</sub>W-WNi<sub>4</sub>/Ni electrode as a promising electrocatalyst candidate for hydroxide exchange membrane-based water electrolyzers and hydrogen fuel cells toward sustainable hydrogen economy. This finding also demonstrates the feasibility of constructing well-defined active multisites to accelerate the kinetics of multiple-intermediate reactions by making use of thermodynamically stable intermetallic compounds as platform materials.

## 4. Experimental Section

Electrocatalysts: Self-supported Preparation of Nanoporous nanoporous electrodes were prepared by an alloying/dealloying procedure. Precursor alloys of  $Ni_{20-x-y}Co_xW_yAl_{80}$  (x = 0 or 6, y = 0 or 4, at%) were first fabricated by arc melting pure Ni and Al metals with/without the addition of Co or/and W in Ar atmosphere and cooled to room temperature in the water cycle-assisted furnace. The alloy ingots were spun into alloy ribbons with thickness of ≈80 μm by melt-spinning method. These alloy ribbons were chemically dealloying in N<sub>2</sub>-poured 6 M KOH solution at 70 °C to prepare nanoporous electrodes. After rinsing in ultrapure water (18 M $\Omega$ ) to clean residual chemicals in nanopores, they are directly used electrocatalytic materials for hydrogen evolution/oxidation measurements. Nanoporous Ni-supported Pt/C electrode was prepared by uniformly mixing Pt/C (20 wt%, Johnson Matthey) into Nafion solution containing water (80%) and isopropanol (20%) with ultrasonication and then dropping onto nanoporous Ni collector with the mass loading of 2 mg cm<sup>-2</sup>. Nanoporous materials were crushed and mixed with carbon black to prepare catalyst ink and then cast on the rotating disk electrode with the loading mass of 0.3 mg cm<sub>disk</sub><sup>-2</sup> for electrochemical

Physicochemical Characterizations: Microstructures and chemical composition features of nanoporous electrodes were characterized by a

X-ray diffraction tests were carried out on a Rigaku Smartlab diffractometer at a power of 9 kW with a monochromated Cu K $\alpha$  radiation. Chemical states of surface elements for nanoporous electrocatalysts were analyzed using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (Thermo ECSALAB 250) with an Al anode, where charging effects were corrected based on the C 1 s peak (284.8 eV). The metal ion concentrations of used electrolyte were detected by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES, Thermo electron).

Electrochemical Measurements: Electrochemical measurements for HOR and HER were performed in a class three-electrode configuration, in which self-supported nanoporous ribbon electrodes were directly used as the working electrode in addition to an Ag/AgCl electrode as the reference electrode and a carbon rod as the counter electrode. For mechanism investigation of HOR, these nanoporous ribbon electrodes were crushed by intense tip sonication in a solution of Nafion (2.0% v/v, Sigma Aldrich), isopropanol (73.5% v/v) and water (24.5% v/v), and then mixed with carbon black (Vulcan XC-72, Cabot) to prepare catalyst inks.  $\approx 5~\mu L$  catalyst inks were drop-cast onto a 5 mm diameter glassy carbon rotating disk electrode (RDE, Pine Research Instrumentation) working electrode. The HOR measurements were conducted in Ar- or H $_2$ -saturated 0.1 m KOH solution at rotation rates from 1200 to 1800 rpm. The kinetic current density ( $j_k$ ) was calculated according to Koutecky-Levich equation,

$$1/\left(A_{\rm geo}j_m\right) = 1/\left(Aj_k\right) + 1/\left(A_{\rm geo}j_d\right) = 1/\left(Aj_k\right) + 1/\left(0.62nFA_{\rm geo}D^{2/3}v^{-1/6}\omega^{1/2}C_{\rm H_2}\right) \tag{1}$$

where  $j_m$  is the measured current density, and  $j_d$  is the diffusion limited current density, n is the number of electrons transferred, F is the Faraday constant (96 485 C  $\mathrm{mol^{-1}}$ ),  $A_{\mathrm{geo}}$  is the area of the electrode (0.196  $\mathrm{cm^2}$ ), Dis the diffusion coefficient of  $H_2$  in 0.1 M KOH solution,  $\nu$  is the viscosity of the electrolyte,  $\omega = 2\pi f/60$  is the angular frequency of rotation at a rate f in r.p.m. and  $C_{\rm H2}$  is the concentration of molecular oxygen in 0.1 M KOH solution. All potentials are iR-corrected and converted to RHE according to the equation  $E_{\rm RHE}=E_{\rm Ag/AgCl}+1.016~{\rm V}$  - iR in 1 m KOH and  $E_{\rm RHE}=$  $E_{Ag/AgCl}$  + 0.957 V - iR in 0.1 m KOH. The HER polarization curves of these electrocatalysts were collected with a scan rate of 1 mV  $\rm s^{-1}$  in Ar-saturated 1 м КОН electrolyte (pH = 13.8) at 25 °C. The HOR polarization curves were measured with a scan rate of 2 mV s<sup>-1</sup> in high-purity H<sub>2</sub>-saturated 0.1 м КОН electrolyte (pH = 12.8) at 25 °C. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analysis was conducted in the frequency range from 10 mHz to 100 kHz with 5 mV amplitude at the overpotential of 100 mV for HER and 30 mV for HOR. The exchange current densities  $(j_0)$  of these electrocatalysts for HOR were determined by the slopes of the linear fitting of current density versus potential in the micro-polarization region (-5-5 mV), according to the simplified Butler–Volmer equation  $j_0 = RTj/F\eta$ , where R is the universal gas constant, T is the temperature, j is the measured current density, and  $\eta$  is the overpotential. In order to assess the electrochemical surface area of these electrocatalysts, cyclic voltammetry curves were performed in the potential range from -0.85 to -0.75 V (vs Ag/AgCl) at scan rates of 40, 45, 50, and 55 mV s<sup>-1</sup> in 1 m KOH. The HER stability test of nanoporous Co<sub>3</sub>W-WNi<sub>4</sub>/Ni electrode was conducted at the overpotential of 100 mV for 1000 h in 1 M KOH, when the stability of Co/Ni electrode was tested at the overpotential of 230 mV for 200 h. Potential cycles from −0.2 to 0.2 V were performed to evaluate HOR durability of nanoporous Co<sub>3</sub>W–WNi<sub>4</sub>/Ni electrode.

DFT Simulation: The spin-polarized DFT calculations were carried out by using the Dmol³ code. The generalized gradient approximation with Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (GGA-PBE) functional was adopted to describe the exchange-correlation effects. The DFT semicore pseudopotentials (DSPP) were used to analyze relativistic effects with a basis set of double numerical plus polarization (DNP). Besides, the Grimme method for DFT-D correction was selected to describe the Van der Waals interactions. The surface models of  $\text{Co}_3\text{W}(001)$  and  $\text{WNi}_4(211)$  were constructed by 2 × 2 supercells with the thickness of four atomic layers, and the interface model of  $\text{Co}_3\text{W}\text{-WNi}_4$  was built by combining a  $\text{Co}_{29}\text{W}_9$  cluster and a  $\text{W}_9\text{Ni}_{40}$  cluster. During the calculations, the bottom two layers of

Co<sub>3</sub>W(001) and WNi<sub>4</sub>(211) were fixed, while all the atoms of Co<sub>3</sub>W–WNi<sub>4</sub> interface were relaxed. The *k*-point samplings of the Brillouin zone were set to  $3\times3\times1$  for Co<sub>3</sub>W(001) and WNi<sub>4</sub>(211), and Gamma point for Co<sub>3</sub>W–WNi<sub>4</sub> interface, respectively. The vacuum layer was set as 15 Å, and the real-space global orbital cutoff radius was set to 4.9 Å. The convergence criteria of energy change, gradient, displacement and were set to be 1.0  $\times$  10<sup>-5</sup> Ha,  $2.0\times10^{-3}$  Ha Å<sup>-1</sup> and  $5.0\times10^{-3}$  Å, respectively. Besides, an implicit solvation model was applied to treat the solvation effect, with the dielectric constant setting as 78.5. To investigate the kinetic energy barrier of water dissociation, the LST/QST method is performed. The reaction Gibbs free energy ( $\Delta G$ ) was calculated by:  $\Delta G = \Delta E + \Delta ZPE - T\Delta S$ , where  $\Delta E$ ,  $\Delta ZPE$ , and  $\Delta S$  were the change of total energy, zero-point energy, and entropy, respectively.

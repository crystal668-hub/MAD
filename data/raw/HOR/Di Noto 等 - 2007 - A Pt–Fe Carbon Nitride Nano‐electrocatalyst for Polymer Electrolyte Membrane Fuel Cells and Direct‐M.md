# A Pt-Fe Carbon Nitride Nano-electrocatalyst for Polymer Electrolyte Membrane Fuel Cells and Direct-Methanol Fuel Cells: Synthesis, Characterization, and Electrochemical Studies\*\*

By Vito Di Noto,\* Enrico Negro, Rocco Gliubizzi, Sandra Lavina, Giuseppe Pace, Silvia Gross, and Chiara Maccato

This report describes the preparation of a new nano-electrocatalyst for applications in polymer electrolyte fuel cells operating with H<sub>2</sub> and methanol. The nano-electrocatalyst, having the composition K<sub>0.12</sub>[Pt<sub>1</sub>Fe<sub>1.6</sub>C<sub>55</sub>N<sub>0.12</sub>], consists of a distribution of Pt and Fe bimetallic clusters supported on carbon nitride nanoparticles. This material was synthesized by thermal treatment of a zeolitic inorganic-organic polymer electrolyte-like (Z-IOPE) precursor, prepared by reacting H<sub>2</sub>PtCl<sub>6</sub> and K<sub>3</sub>Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub> in the presence of sucrose, as organic binder, in a water solution. This reaction allows the desired material to be prepared by means of a sol $\rightarrow$ gel process followed by a gel $\rightarrow$ plastic transition. The morphology and surface properties of  $K_{0.12}[Pt_1Fe_{1.6}C_{55}N_{0.12}]$  were studied via scanning and high-resolution transmission electron microscopies and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Far-infrared, mid-infrared, and micro-Raman-laser spectroscopies, as well as X-ray diffraction studies, together with detailed compositional data reveal the structural information and describe the interactions characterizing the mass activity of the K<sub>0.12</sub>[Pt<sub>1</sub>Fe<sub>1.6</sub>C<sub>55</sub>N<sub>0.12</sub>] system. This material has structural and morphological features that are very different to those usually found in commercially available electrocatalysts for application in H<sub>2</sub> polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) and direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs). K<sub>0.12</sub>[Pt<sub>1</sub>Fe<sub>1.6</sub>C<sub>55</sub>N<sub>0.12</sub>] consists of active bimetallic catalytic sites supported on a mixture of α and graphitic carbon nitride-like nanoparticles. The studies performed by cyclic voltammetry with the thin-film rotatingdisk electrode indicate that the performance of K<sub>0.12</sub>[Pt<sub>1</sub>Fe<sub>1.6</sub>C<sub>55</sub>N<sub>0.12</sub>] and of the EC-20 reference material is a) equal to -255 and -216 A g<sup>-1</sup> Pt, respectively, in the oxygen-reduction reaction at 0.75 V; and b) equal to 967 and 533 A g<sup>-1</sup> Pt, respectively, in the hydrogen-oxidation reaction at potentials lower than 0.2 V. The activation potential of  $K_{0.12}[Pt_1Fe_{1.6}C_{55}N_{0.12}]$  is about 15 mV higher than that of the EC-20 reference. In conclusion, the proposed synthesis route is general and promising for the development of new, improved nano-electrocatalysts for low-temperature fuel cells such as PEMFCs and DMFCs.

### 1. Introduction

[1] These devices, which are based on an acid polymer electrolyte membrane as ionic conductor, have received considerable attention because of their potential use in transportation and portable electronics, and environmental pollution reduction. In principle, they are capable of extremely high efficiencies, much higher than those featured by internal combustion engines. The latter, after decades of improvements, have now reached their efficiency limit of approximately 40 %. [1] Instead, the theoretical maximum efficiency of PEMFCs and DMFCs is proposed to be as high as 65 %; thus, highlighting that the potential of these devices is still far from being completely exploited.<sup>[1]</sup> PEMFCs and DMFCs, which use hydrogen and methanol, respectively, as fuel, are relatively light and very promising systems for applications in automotive systems and portable electronics. [2,3] However, it should be pointed out that the electrical power per electrode area generated by DMFCs is lower, when compared to that obtained in conventional hydrogen PEMFCs, in which the highest efficiency is obtained because of a large operating potential and the lack of any byproducts. In spite of this, DMFCs offer a number of practical advantages: a) no cell cooling system is required; thus, saving significantly on volume reequirements; b) no humidification process of fuels is needed; c) easily minia-

turized; d) light-weight; e) less complex and expensive than PEMFCs.[1,3,4]

Nevertheless, DMFCs still need significant improvements in order to fulfill large-scale production characteristics. Several crucial issues have been identified in the development of these devices, concerning two fundamental cell components: electrolyte membrane and electrode configuration. The crucial points to be solved in the field of electrode configuration are: 1) the high cost of materials, which compromises the economic competitiveness of the cell; 2) the low tolerance of conventional catalysts toward the product of methanol oxidation and other chemicals, which reduces the operating lifetime; 3) nonoptimal morphologies, which reduce output power; 4) the need to reduce precious metal-loading in membrane and electrode assemblies (MEAs) and to eliminate induced voltage losses. The two most important drawbacks of DMFCs concern the cathode electrode. The first is the cathode-poisoning process, which originates when methanol crossover occurs from anode to cathode. This process is followed by oxidative decomposition of the fuel and the development of carbon monoxide.[3,5–10] The second serious drawback regards the high overpotential of the cathode electrode, which originates in the slow kinetics of the oxygen-reduction reaction (ORR).[5,11] Significant efforts have been devoted in both academic and industrial research to develop improved catalysts capable of solving the above limitations. It has been proposed that the most promising electrocatalysts are those obtained by supporting plurimetallic alloys, obtained by mixing platinum with another first-row transition metal, such as V,[12] Cr,[4,9,13] Fe,[14,15] Co,[5,13,16] or Ni,[7,8,13,17,18] on conducting graphite-like carbon derivatives. These systems, the active sites of which consist of plurimetallic alloys with oxidation state (0), are endowed with a slightly lower overpotential for the ORR[5,14,15,18] and are much more resistant to the poisoning effect of contaminants derived from the parasitic electro-oxidation of methanol at the cathode.[7,8,15]

In this Full Paper, we describe the synthesis and characterization of K0.12[Pt1Fe1.6C55N0.12], a new bimetallic carbon nitride polyphasic nanomaterial, obtained by thermal decomposition of a zeolitic inorganic–organic polymer electrolyte (Z-IOPE) precursor. The precursor is obtained by sol→gel and gel→plastic transitions and consists of a new inorganic–organic network based on H2PtCl6, K3Fe(CN)6, and sucrose. The structure of the resulting K0.12[Pt1Fe1.6C55N0.12] nano-electrocatalyst was examined by vibrational spectroscopy techniques (mid- and far-IR, and micro-Raman laser) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies. The morphology and surface structure of the material was also studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements, and thermal analyses were carried out using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The mass activity of the new K0.12[Pt1Fe1.6C55N0.12] nano-electrocatalyst was evaluated in ORR and hydrogen-oxidation reaction (HOR) by means of cyclic voltammetry with the thin-film rotating-disk electrode (CV-TF-RDE) method.[19]

### **2.1. Chemical Composition of K0.12[Pt1Fe1.6C55N0.12]**

Inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) and elemental analyses were used to determine the chemical composition of both the K0.12[Pt1Fe1.6C55N0.12] material and EC-20, adopted as reference electrocatalyst. The results are reported in Table 1. The data of Table 1 indicate that the Fe/Pt molar ratio (i.e., 1.6) of the K0.12[Pt1Fe1.6C55N0.12] material is quite similar to that of metals in reagents

(i.e., 1.875). This result is in accordance with other studies and leads to the conclusion that the proposed synthesis route can easily modulate the relative amounts of active metals in the final product.[20,21] In addition, despite extensive washings, the material still has a small fraction of potassium, which is attributed to incomplete reduction of the metal atoms. Potassium is probably needed to counterbalance the electrical charge of the anionic complexes. The absence of hydrogen in the chemical composition of the material shows that graphitization of the organic fraction is complete. The result is a compound with a heterocyclic graphite-like structure and good electrical conductivity. Analysis of the EC-20 material led to results compatible with its nominal chemical composition (i.e., 20 % Pt, 80% C). The composition of the product proposed here is K0.12[Pt1Fe1.6C55N0.12].

### **2.2. Structural Characterization of K0.12[Pt1Fe1.6C55N0.12]**

### *2.2.1. Thermogravimetric Analyses*

Thermogravimetric profiles are shown in Figure 1, and the thermal parameters determined from TG curves measured in an oxidizing atmosphere are listed in Table 2. TG measurements in an inert atmosphere showed that EC-20 is more resistant to thermal treatment than K0.12[Pt1Fe1.6C55N0.12]. In addition, the latter undergoes a sudden mass loss at about 670 °C, showing that it is composed of several phases. These observations are confirmed by TGA profiles measured in an oxidizing atmosphere (Fig. 1b) in which, at about 400 °C, a) two massloss events are measured for K0.12[Pt1Fe1.6C55N0.12] and one for EC-20; and b) the onset of mass elimination recorded at the highest temperature coincides in both materials. Thus,

[a] Mass elimination.

K0.12[Pt1Fe1.6C55N0.12] seems to be composed of two phases: the first mass elimination at 332 °C corresponds to oxidation of that fraction of the material that is richer in oxygen and nitrogen atoms; the second, at 399 °C, is attributed almost exclusively to the decomposition of the graphite-like component of the catalyst. At high temperatures, the residue of EC-20 was 21.09 wt%; thus, corresponding to the nominal Pt loading in the material (20 wt%). The residue of K0.12[Pt1Fe1.6C55N0.12] was larger than the expected sum of the nonvolatile metal elements because of the formation of oxides and carbon nitrides at high temperatures. The elemental composition shown in Table 1 is in accordance with the TGA studies.

### *2.2.2. Vibrational Spectroscopy Studies*

Structural information on the materials was determined by far-IR (FIR), mid-IR (MIR), and micro-Raman spectroscopy studies on the EC-20 and K0.12[Pt1Fe1.6C55N0.12] systems. MIR and micro-Raman spectra are shown in Figure 2. The correlative assignments of vibrational peaks are listed in Table 3.[22–36] The vibrational spectra are diagnostic of the following three main structural characteristics: a) modes associated with car-

bon nitride (CN) backbone material components; b) bands associated with cyanide bridging and terminal groups; c) peaks attributed to vibrations of ether, phenol, alcohol, and carboxyl groups on the surface of CN grains; d) metal–ligand modes associated with the active metal complexes supported on CN particles. The MIR and micro-Raman frequencies in the region 1800–1000 cm–1 show important spectral features associated with graphitic-like materials. Peaks at about 1575 and 1370 cm–1 in the Raman spectra were assigned, respectively, to the Raman-active E2g graphitic (G) and the A1g modes of lattice vibration, which become Raman-active because of the disordered finite crystal size (D).[25] The G and D bands, which

are infrared inactive in typical amorphous carbon materials, become active when nitrogen is substituted for carbon or when, owing to considerable structural disorder, a breakdown of the k-selection rule in graphitic materials occurs. [37] In accordance with other studies, in the G and D region, the shapes of the IR and Raman profiles coincide with those of a graphitic-based carbon nitride material with a nitrogen content ranging from 2

to 9%. [37,38] This indicates that in graphitic microdomains of  $K_{0.12}[Pt_1Fe_{1.6}C_{55}N_{0.12}]$ : a) C is present both as sp<sup>3</sup> and sp<sup>2</sup> carbons, as well as other functionalities like alcohols, ethers, and phenols; b) a fraction of the total amount of N is replaced by sp<sup>2</sup> carbons. In accordance with other studies on the surface functionalities of carbon materials, such as alcohols, ethers, and phenols, [29] vibrational modes are attributed to MIR bands peaking in the region 1258-1020 cm<sup>-1</sup> (Table 3). The presence of bridging and terminal vibrational modes in the 2000–2400 cm<sup>-1</sup> region (Fig. 2, Table 3) suggests that the nitrogen not involved in the formation of carbon nitride bulk particles gives rise to two types of surface cyanide groups.[22-24] The first bridges Fe and Pt atoms, and the second is present as terminal free groups. Inspection of the FIR (Fig. 3, Table 3) and micro-Raman spectra at frequencies lower that 700 cm<sup>-1</sup> (Fig. 2) shows that:<sup>[31]</sup> a) v(Pt-N), v(Fe-O), v(Pt-O);  $v_8(Fe-C)$ ;  $v_7(Pt-Cl)$ ; v(Fe-Cl) metal-ligand stretching vibrations revealed  $K_{0.12}[Pt_1Fe_{1.6}C_{55}N_{0.12}];$  b)  $A_g$  lattice vibrations of both β-phase carbon nitrides and graphitic materials are observed<sup>[35,36]</sup> (Table 3). In addition, the particle grain size of the studied materials was determined using Raman G and D bands, following the procedure outlined in the literature. [25] Results indicate that the particle size of  $K_{0.12}[Pt_1Fe_{1.6}C_{55}N_{0.12}]$  is 1.7 nm and that of reference EC-20 is 1.4 nm. In summary, vibrational studies indicate that the proposed material consists of nanoparticles of various carbon nitride phases supporting bimetallic clusters, consisting of structural units of Fe and Pt metal atoms bonded together through bridging cyanide groups, on their surface.

### 2.2.3. XRD Analysis

For information on the structural features of  $K_{0.12}[Pt_1Fe_{1.6}C_{55}N_{0.12}]$  and reference EC-20, powder XRD spectra were collected and carefully analyzed. The spectra are shown in Figure 4. The XRD spectrum of EC-20 was easily Miller-indexed on the basis of other studies (Fig. 4). [38] In particular, the features

typical of graphite were observed, with peaks at  $2\theta \approx 13.3$  and  $25^{\circ}$ , attributed to (002) and (111) reflections. Peaks ascribable to platinum, characterized by a face-centered cubic structure, are located at  $2\theta \approx 39.9^{\circ}$ ,  $46.1^{\circ}$ , and  $67.6^{\circ}$ , attributed to the (111), (200), and (220) interplanar distances of the metal, respectively. Comparison of the XRD profiles of EC-20 with that of  $K_{0.12}[Pt_1Fe_{1.6}C_{55}N_{0.12}]$  shows that a) in both materials, the

(002) graphite-like reflection at  $2\theta \approx 12^{\circ}$  has the same shape, b) the peaks of  $K_{0.12}[Pt_1Fe_{1.6}C_{55}N_{0.12}]$  at about  $2\theta \approx 39^{\circ}$ ,  $46^{\circ}$ , and 67° show different shapes and intensities. These observations, and the lower Pt concentration in  $K_{0.12}[Pt_1Fe_{1.6}C_{55}N_{0.12}]$ , indicate that the structural characteristics of the proposed product is different from that of EC-20. Indeed, careful analysis of the XRD pattern of  $K_{0.12}[Pt_1Fe_{1.6}C_{55}N_{0.12}]$  shows that this very complex material is basically composed of two different carbon nitride polymorphs as its main components and that the presence of other phases could not be excluded. Miller indexing and calculation of diffraction peak intensities was performed, assuming that the K<sub>0.12</sub>[Pt<sub>1</sub>Fe<sub>1.6</sub>C<sub>55</sub>N<sub>0.12</sub>] bulk material consists of two different carbon nitrides, whose structures coincide with that of an α-phase C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> and graphitic C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> structure. The α-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> structure is described as an ABAB···· stacking se-

quence of layers of β-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> (A) and its mirror image (B). The graphitic C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> structure consists of ABAB.... stacking of planar graphitic-like layer structures. In detail, numerical calculations were carried out for the two polymorphs as described elsewhere, [39] assuming: a) the cell parameters proposed by Teter and Hemley for α-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> and graphitic-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>;<sup>[40]</sup> b) a sample composition similar to that of each carbon nitride proposed in the literature but with the nitrogen almost completely replaced with carbon sp<sup>2</sup>:[40] thus, the  $\alpha$ - and graphitic- $[C_3(sp^3)C_4(sp^2)]_7[C_{0.857}N_{0.12}]$  structures were considered, which we indicated as α-CN and graphitic-CN nitride as polymorphs of  $K_{0.12}[Pt_1Fe_{1.6}C_{55}N_{0.12}]$  bulk material. Relevant information on spectral reflections, including normalized intensity, position, full width at half maximum (FWHM), interplanar distance, crystallite size, and peak attributions are listed in Table 4. The dimensions of the crystallites, evaluated with the Debye-

Scherrer method, point to a situation in which the various components of the material have different domain sizes with mean crystallite shapes typical of platelike nanoparticles. The planes originating from the ordering of graphite-like structures have the smallest size, i.e., about 2 nm (compatible with Raman spectroscopy results). The other peaks indicate longer-range ordering. It should be pointed out that this latter size is much larger than that of the platinum crystallites in the EC-20 reference material (i.e., about 3-4 nm), indicating that bimetal cluster complexes are present preferentially on the surface of the two bulk carbon nitride-like polymorphs of the  $K_{0.12}[Pt_1Fe_{1.6}C_{55}N_{0.12}]$  bulk material. Lastly, the XRD analyses fit the vibrational results, which show that the studied material is composed of both graphitic-like-based material and β-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>-like components. It should be pointed out that

> β-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>-like layers are the building blocks of α-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>-like carbon nitride structures.

### 2.3. Surface Studies

### 2.3.1. Morphology Analyses

 $K_{0.12}[Pt_1Fe_{1.6}C_{55}N_{0.12}]$  and EC-20 were inspected by high-resolution SEM to gain information on their surface morphologies. The corresponding images are shown in Figure 5. The surface morphologies of the two samples show significant differences. EC-20 appears to be covered by small, smooth, round formations (average diameter ca. 80 nm) whereas  $K_{0.12}[Pt_1Fe_{1.6}C_{55}N_{0.12}]$  has a rougher, foam-like appearance, and the cavities have an average diameter of 50 nm or less. This information points to a larger surface area for the  $K_{0.12}[Pt_1Fe_{1.6}C_{55}N_{0.12}]$

[a] Calculated according to equilibrium structural parameters described in Table 1 of Ref. [40], by substituting N with carbon C sp2 in order to respect the composition of the proposed sample. Calculations performed as reported in [39], assuming the following parameters for the two polycrystalline powder phases: i) for the a-CN-like phase, the space group was *P*31*c* (159), the cell parameters were *a* = 4.7420 Å, b = 6.7205 Å, and the average crystallite size of the nanopowders was *N*<sup>1</sup> = *N*<sup>2</sup> = 23 and *N*<sup>3</sup> = 15; with *i* = 1, 2, and 3 in *Ni* indicating the number of cells along *a*, *b*, and *c*; ii) for the graphitic-CNlike, the space group was *P*6¯*m*2 (187), the cell parameters were *a* = 4.7420 Å and *c* = 6.7205 Å; the number of cells along the crystallographic axes were *N*<sup>1</sup> = *N*<sup>2</sup> = 10, and *N*<sup>3</sup> = 22. [b] Determined using the Debye–Scherrer method on the *Ihkl* reflections and corresponding to the average crystallite dimension depending on the reflecting plane *hkl*.

material. The two samples were also inspected with backscattered electrons over a larger surface area, as shown in Figure 6. Heavy atoms are distributed in a very different way in the two samples. EC-20 is covered by a uniform layer of heavy atoms, whereas K0.12[Pt1Fe1.6C55N0.12] is composed of two different phases, that is, a metal-poor matrix with a metal-rich material phase immersed in it. This impression is confirmed by the element maps of platinum collected via X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (see Fig. 7a and b). In K0.12[Pt1Fe1.6C55N0.12], platinum is indeed mainly concentrated in small spots (Fig. 7a), whereas the platinum atoms are much more uniformly distributed on the surface of the EC-20 reference (see Fig. 7b).

### *2.3.2. XPS Measurements*

Information on the chemical state of various species in the two samples was obtained by XPS studies. The survey spectra of both samples are shown in Figure 8. The presence of carbon, oxygen, and platinum was evidenced in samples. The peak ascribable to Pt is more intense in the EC-20 spectrum because of its higher surface concentration, as evidenced in Table 5. In both samples, the carbon peak is characterized by a binding energy (BE) of 284.4 eV. This value is in perfect agreement with the typical value reported for graphite-like materials.[41] As expected, a substantial amount of nitrogen is revealed for K0.12[Pt1Fe1.6C55N0.12], thus, revealing that this element also occurs in the outermost layers of the nanoparticles. To carry out quantitative analyses, detailed scans were acquired for the C 1s, O 1s, Fe 2p, and Pt 4f regions. Results are listed in Table 5. Comparison of XPS spectra of the materials shows important differences in the oxidation state of the platinum atoms. The Pt 4f region of both XPS spectra was decomposed, and the results are shown in Figure 9a and b. In particular, in the Pt 4f region: a) EC-20 shows only one component, peaking at 71.5 eV; b) K0.12[Pt1Fe1.6C55N0.12] has two peaks, at 71.3 and 72.5 eV; the lowerenergy peak was ascribed to a Pt0 species, and the higher-energy peak, which was observed only in K0.12[Pt1Fe1.6C55N0.12], was ascribed to a PtII species. The Pt metal atom was expected to be coordinated by nitrogen- or carbon-based ligands of heterocyclic aromatic systems or other ligand species.[41] The molar ratio between the Pt<sup>0</sup> and PtII species in K0.12[Pt1Fe1.6C55N0.12], determined by the relative areas of the corresponding

XPS peaks, was about 5:1. In addition, the main component of the Fe 2p peak is revealed at 710.5 eV (Fig. 9c). This latter peak, owing to the low Fe concentration in the sample (< 1 atomic %), is hardly recognized in the XPS spectrum. Furthermore, the detailed scan region shown in Figure 9c permitted us to reveal that Fe is compatible with a chemical environment in which[41] a) iron is present as FeIII; b) FeIII is mostly coordinated by a ligand species in a complexing geometry similar to that of oxygen atoms in Fe2O3. The symmetric O 1s peak is measured at 532 eV and corresponds to a BE value typical of O in oxygenated organic groups such as esters, aromatic rings, carboxylates, alcoholates, polyalcohol, and polyether groups.

# **2.4. Electrochemical Studies**

The aim of our electrochemical measurements was to determine the mass activity of K0.12[Pt1Fe1.6C55N0.12] towards some of the most important electrochemical reactions taking place in low-temperature fuel cells (DMFCs, PEMFCs), i.e., a) ORR; b) HOR. The EC-20 reference was tested in exactly the same conditions. Figure 10a and b compares the mass activities of the materials towards ORR and HOR at different sweep rates.

Tests were performed by cyclic voltammetry with the thin-film rotating-disk electrode (CV-TF-RDE) method described elsewhere.[19] The most significant figures describing the electrochemical performance of the materials are reported in Table 6. The maximum HOR mass activity of each material was measured at potentials of < 200 mV versus the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE). The reported activation potential values refer to the cathodic sweep of CV-TF-RDE and were evaluated in the Tafel plots of Figure 10b at log(*i*kin) = 0, where *i*kin corresponds to the mass-transport corrected kinetic current. The electrochemical performance, in terms of mass activity and potentials, of K0.12[Pt1Fe1.6C55N0.12] in both HOR and ORR was higher than that of EC-20 at both 100 and 5 mV s–1. Similar behavior with respect to potential has already been observed in other bimetal ORR catalysts.[5,14,15,18] Mass activity was chosen as a parameter to compare the electrochemical performance of the catalyst materials because of its practical importance in the

assembly of fuel cells, mounting as little platinum as possible, and the difficulty in determining the active area of the material with conventional methods.[5,42,43] In addition, it should be highlighted that, in HOR, the possibility that oxidized species of iron complexes can contribute to the overall hydrogen oxidation process cannot be excluded. Nevertheless, after long-term testing of the material, no evidence of this parallel side-reaction pathway was detected. In addition, in order to definitively conclude that the activity of the proposed material in the HOR process is better than that of the EC-20 reference material, further detailed investigations are necessary. Tafel slopes, evaluated in the plots of potential versus log(*i*kin), were equal to –60.3 and –120.1 mV/decade for EC-20 and –60.4 and –119.9 mV/decade for the K0.12[Pt1Fe1.6C55N0.12] system. This evidence indicates very similar catalytic reaction mechanisms for the ORR of the two materials.

# **3. Discussion**

# **3.1. Reaction Mechanisms in the Synthesis of K0.12[Pt1Fe1.6C55N0.12]**

The K0.12[Pt1Fe1.6C55N0.12] system was prepared by means of a two-step synthesis protocol. With respect to preparation routes widely reported in the literature,[9,44] our synthesis route features several important differences. First, the plastic precursor is prepared by means of an alkoxide-free sol→ gel process, followed by a gel →plastic transition, which occurs when two separate solutions, A and B, are mixed together.[20,21] A and B consist, respectively, of H2PtCl6 and K3Fe(CN)6 dissolved in an aqueous solution of sucrose. The processes take place by wellestablished reactions:[22–24,45] the Cl– ligand, which is a good

leaving ion, may be substituted in PtCl6 2– by either the nitrogen atom of Fe(CN)6 3– cyanometalate, or the hydroxyl groups of sucrose. As reported elsewhere,[22–24,45] mixing of solutions A and B triggers the solution reactions shown in Scheme 1, which are responsible for the formation of the most stable intermediate derivatives, indicated as I. Bonding of I complexes with a cyanometalate group produces intermediate metal cluster II (Scheme 2). Owing to a polycondensation reaction with elimination of hydrochloric acid and water, the latter gives rise to a gel network, in which clusters II are bonded together by sucrose

**Figure 10.** CV-TF-RDE profiles of K0.12[Pt1Fe1.6C55N0.12] (solid line) and EC-20 reference (dotted line) toward HOR and ORR in 0.1 <sup>M</sup> HClO4 at a) 100 mV s–1, and b) 5 mV s–1. c) Tafel plots (potential vs. log(*i*kin)) obtained from the rotating-disk data of (b); *i*kin = *i*d·*i*/(*i*d–*i*), where *i*kin, *i*d, and *i* are the mass-transport corrected kinetic current, the diffusion-limited current, and the measured current, respectively. The platinum loading for the electrode mounting the K0.12[Pt1Fe1.6C55N0.12] and the EC-20 reference was 1.4 and 5 lg of Pt per square centimeter, respectively. *T* = 333 K; rotation speed = 1600 rpm.

bridges in a three-dimensional crosslinked structure (Scheme 2). The overall result is an alkoxide-free sol–gel transition, leading to a homogeneous metallorganic gel characterized by uniform dispersion of metal centers in the organic binder. An increase in the number of crosslinks with further elimination of water causes the gel to contract and a plastic material forms. Second, a multi-step thermal decomposition protocol of the plastic material is performed under vacuum and an inert atmosphere, without any use of reducing agents. The first step is performed at 200 °C for 12 h to completely eliminate residual water molecules embedded in the bulk material. The second step is carried out at 900 °C for 1 h, in order to a) remove hydrogen and oxygen atoms from the bulk material, and b) obtain a system in which active bimetal sites are immersed in a graphite-like host material. In these conditions, most of the metal atoms are expected to be reduced by the carbon-rich environment. The third step consists of thermal treatment at 700 °C for 4 h, which completes graphitization of the material and gives rise to a product with better morphology. Careful final washing is required to remove the KCl still present in the bulk material and thus to avoid the poisoning effect of chloride contamination toward the ORR of the material.[10,46,47] Lastly, activation with hydrogen peroxide is carried out to remove loosely bound organic groups from active catalyst clusters.

# **3.2. Correlation between Structural Hypothesis and Performance of K0.12[Pt1Fe1.6C55N0.12]**

Integration of the information extracted from the above-described characterization studies provides deeper understanding of the relationships between the chemical and structural properties of the electrocatalyst material studied and its electrochemical performance. The first important evidence is that the chemical, structural, and surface features of K0.12[Pt1Fe1.6C55N0.12] are very different from those of commonly studied electrocatalysts, such as the EC-20 reference, which are obtained by supporting Pt or its alloys on the surface of XC-72R carbon black. Vibrational, XRD, and XPS studies allow us to conclude that K0.12[Pt1Fe1.6C55N0.12] consists of a) a blend of two main graphitic components, with structures very similar to those of a-phase and graphitic carbon nitride; b) Pt and Fe are present as bimetal cluster complexes, supported on the nanoparticle surface of both carbon nitride polymorphs; c) Pt, which is present almost completely in the Pt<sup>0</sup> oxidation state, is bonded to FeIII by the cyanide bridges and pyridine aromatic rings of the graphitic layers; d) the crystallite sizes of the graphitic phases in (002) and (200) directions, determined by both micro-Raman and XRD, are about 2 nm, whereas those of other directions determined by XRD are about 18 nm. In addition, despite the much smaller crystal size of the platinum particles, determined by XRD measurements in EC-20, the high-resolution SEM images reveal a picture in which more efficient mass exploitation of the noble metal is achieved in K0.12[Pt1Fe1.6C55N0.12]. For these reasons, it is hypothesized that a) the platinum in EC-20 is not totally active, because catalytic sites are present as pure Pt nanoparticles covering the whole graphite support surface; b) the active electrocatalyst sites provided by Pt and Fe bimetal clusters of complexes supported on carbon nitride nanoparticles are much more greatly dispersed in K0.12[Pt1Fe1.6C55N0.12], giving rise to a greater mass exploitation of platinum and, thus, larger current intensities. It is hypothesized that the bimetallic electroactive sites are bonded on the surface or edges of graphitic-CNlike nanoparticles, which are grafted on the surface of the

foam-forming a-CN-like support. Thus, reagents for electrochemical reactions can easily reach active sites by diffusing through the large pores of the nanofoam-like surface of the electrocatalyst. This hypothesis is strongly supported by the HRTEM analyses shown in Figure 11a and b, which confirm that the dark spots of the graphitic-CN-like nanoparticles are housed on the foam-forming a-CN-like bulk support. In addition, the maximum enlargement on the surface of the graphit-

ic-CN-like nanoparticles (Fig. 11b) shows that the active bimetal complexes are supported on the edges of graphitic-CN-like layers. The overall supramolecular model hypothesized for K0.12[Pt1Fe1.6C55N0.12] is shown in Figure 11c. Lastly, the above spectroscopic, XRD, and HRTEM results allow us to hypothesize the structural model depicted in Scheme 3 for the electro-

catalytic building-block nanoparticles. The structure consists of a matrix of graphitic-CN-like materials, supporting active bimetal cluster sites on their surface or edges. The cluster site is composed of a Pt<sup>0</sup> atom coordinated in square-planar coordination geometry by two nitrogen atoms of the pyridine rings of the carbon nitride graphitic layer and two bridging cyanide groups. These bridge the square-planar coordinated platinum complexes with two octahedrally coordinated FeIII atoms in their neighborhood. FeIII atoms complete the octahedral coordination geometry with hydroxyl ligands. The proposed structural model of active sites explains the excellent catalytic performance of K0.12[Pt1Fe1.6C55N0.12]. Indeed, the presence of highly acidic hydroxyl FeIII complexes near the Pt active sites efficiently catalyzes the elimination of ORR products. The result is a very active electrocatalyst for both the ORR and HOR processes.[15]

# **4. Conclusions**

A new synthesis procedure for preparing an electrocatalyst for use in low-temperature fuel cells is described. The main steps are: a) synthesis of a metallorganic precursor by means of a sol→ gel and a gel→ plastic transition, reacting H2PtCl6 and K3Fe(CN)6 together in the presence of sucrose as organic binder; b) thermal treatment of the plastic precursor to obtain a bimetal carbon nitride system with the formula K0.12[Pt1Fe1.6C55N0.12]. The resulting material was extensively characterized from the chemical, structural, and morphological points of view, and revealed properties very different from those of the EC-20 reference material. XRD, Fourier-transform IR, and micro-Raman studies showed that the material consists of a blend of two polymorphic phases, in the form of nanoparticles, having bulk structures similar to those of a-C3N4-like and graphitic like carbon nitride materials. XPS indicated that, in bimetal complexes supported on carbon nitrides, Pt is present almost completely in the Pt<sup>0</sup> oxidation state, whereas Fe exists as FeIII. High-resolution SEM and HRTEM micrographs showed that the nanoparticles of the catalyst have a very rough foam-like surface morphology. The larger surface area, together with the finer dispersion of active bimetal catalytic sites, explains the high mass activity of K0.12[Pt1Fe1.6C55N0.12]. With respect to commercially available materials, K0.12[Pt1Fe1.6C55N0.12] is an interesting electrocatalyst for use in PEMFCs and DMFCs because of its high electrochemical performance. In addition, its flexibility and good control of the chemical composition make the proposed synthesis route promising to obtain improved electrocatalysts for applications in low-temperature fuel cells.

# **5. Experimental**

### **5.1. Materials**

Hexachloroplatinic(IV) acid hydrate, purum, potassium ferricyanide(III) (99%), and KOH pellets were purchased from Aldrich; D(+) sucrose (biochemical grade) was provided by Acros. H2O2 (36 vol %) was supplied by ABCR GmbH. All reagents were used as received.

XC-72 R carbon black was provided as a courtesy by Carbocrom s.r.l., and was washed with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (10 vol %) prior to use. The commercial EC-20 catalyst, produced by ElectroChem Inc. (nominal Pt loading: 20 wt %), was used as a reference without any further purification or washing procedures.

### 5.2. Sample Preparation

Hexachloroplatinic acid (1 g) was dissolved in 4 mL of Milli-Q water, yielding a yellowish solution whose pH was brought to 8.5 with KOH. Potassium ferricyanide(III) (1.26 g) was dissolved in 5 mL of Milli-Q water, yielding a yellow solution. Sucrose (4.46 g) was dissolved in the minimum amount of water and then divided equally between the two solutions. The resulting solutions were then mixed together and stirred under weak heating at 50 °C for a few minutes. It was left for two days, giving rise to a sol-gel and a gel-plastic transition. The plastic precursor material was transferred into a quartz tube and heated in a dynamic vacuum of  $10^{-3}$  bar (1 bar = 100 kPa), as follows: a) 12 h at 200 °C; b) 1 h at 900 °C; c) 4 h at 700 °C. The resulting black material was then removed from the tube and finely ground by ball milling for 3 h. The powder was washed three times with Milli-Q water, treated with 10 vol  $\%\,\,H_2O_2,$  and dried under an infrared lamp until all the water was removed.

#### 5.3. Chemical and Structural Characterization

The metal composition of the material was determined by ICP-AES using the method of standard additions. Emission lines were:  $\lambda(Pt) = 214.423 \text{ nm}, \lambda(Fe) = 259.940 \text{ nm}, \lambda(K) = 766.490 \text{ nm}.$  Further details on the experimental setup, mineralization procedure, and elemental analyses are reported in [21]. Thermal analyses were carried out on a High-Res modulated TGA 2950 thermogravimetric analyzer, manufactured by TA Instruments, in an open platinum pan and a temperature range from 30 to 1000 °C. Samples were tested in both an inert  $N_{\rm 2}$ and an oxidising air atmosphere. FT-IR measurements in both midand far-IR were collected on a Nicolet FT-IR Nexus spectrometer, at a resolution of 4 cm<sup>-1</sup>. MIR measurements were derived by averaging 500 scans. Samples were dispersed in anhydrous KBr pellets and sealed in a cell with KBr windows filled with a N2 inert atmosphere. FIR spectra were derived by averaging 400 scans. Measurements were carried out on samples spread as thin films on a polyethylene window with nujol. Baseline correction was performed with Nicolet FT-IR Nexus spectrometer software. Micro-Raman spectra were collected on a homemade instrument comprising: a) a double Czerny-Turner monochromator, at a focal distance of 400 mm and a grating of 1800 lines mm<sup>-1</sup> blazed at 5000 Å; b) a Spectra-Physics Stabilite 2017 argon ion laser, with the excitation line set at 514.15 nm, acting as the light source; c) an Olympus BX-41 confocal microscope equipped with a 50 × objective lens: d) a Jobin-Yvon Symphony charge-coupled device (CCD) detector system, cooled with liquid nitrogen. XRD data were collected on a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer equipped with a Göbel mirror and a Cu Ka source (40 kV, 40 mA) in the  $2\theta$  range  $2^{\circ}$ – $80^{\circ}$ , with  $0.02^{\circ}$ step and an integration time of 15 s.

#### 5.4. Surface Studies

Field-emission-scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and energydispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) were carried out on a Zeiss SUPRA 40VP instrument equipped with an Oxford INCA X-sight X-ray detector operated at acceleration voltages between 5.00 and 10 kV. HRTEM analysis was performed at 300 kV using a Jeol 3010 apparatus with a high-resolution pole piece (0.17 nm point-to-point resolution), equipped with a Gatan slowscan 794 CCD camera. The samples were suspended in isopropyl alcohol. A 5 µL drop of this suspension was deposited on a holey carbon film supported on 3 mm copper grid for TEM investigation. XPS analyses were run on a Perkin–Elmer Φ5600ci spectrometer with standard Al Ka radiation (1486.6 eV) operating at 350 W. Working pressure was lower than

 $5 \times 10^{-8}$  Pa. The spectrometer was calibrated by assuming binding energy (BE) of the Au 4f<sub>7/2</sub> line at 83.9 eV with respect to the Fermi level. The standard deviation for BE values was 0.15 eV. Survey scans (187.85 eV pass energy, 1 eV per step, 50 ms per step) were obtained in the 0-1300 eV range. Detailed scans (58.7 eV pass energy, 0.2 eV per step, 50 ms per step) were recorded for the O1s, C1s, N1s, Cl2p, K 2p, Fe 2p, and Pt 4f regions. Atomic composition was evaluated after Shirley-type background subtraction [48], with sensitivity factors supplied by Perkin-Elmer [41]. Samples were introduced directly into the XPS analytical chamber by a fast entry lock system. Peaks were assigned on the basis of the values reported by Moulder et al. and in the NIST XPS Database [41,49].

# 5.5. Electrode Preparation and Electrochemical Measurements

Porous electrodes were prepared according to a procedure described elsewhere [5,19].  $K_{0.12}[Pt_1Fe_{1.6}C_{55}N_{0.12}]$  (6.44 mg) material was added to XC-72 R carbon black (16.72 mg). The resulting mixture was ballmilled for 3 h to obtain homogeneous dispersion. The resulting powder (5.79 mg) was placed in a test tube, together with ultrapure Milli-Q water (15.96 g; Millipore), and 147 µL of a commercial Nafion solution (Aldrich, 5% by weight). The resulting ink was sonicated for about one hour to ensure a good homogeneity. 15 µL of the ink were then transferred to the top of a freshly polished glassy-carbon electrode tip with an active diameter of 5 mm, yielding an overall Pt loading of about 1.4 µg Pt per square centimeter. Water was then removed from the ink by evaporation under an IR lamp. The same procedure was applied to prepare the electrode to test the EC-20 reference material, with the only difference being that no XC-72 R was added, resulting in an overall Pt loading of about 5 µg Pt per square centimeter. The tip was then mounted on an EDI 101 rotating electrode attached to a CTV 101 speed-control unit, both produced by Radiometer Analytical. The resulting system was used as a working electrode in order to test the specific ORR and HOR activities of the catalyst materials. A platinum counter electrode was adopted. A Hg/HgSO<sub>4</sub>/K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> (sat.) reference electrode was placed in a separate compartment and connected to the main electrochemical cell by a salt bridge filled with a KClO<sub>4</sub> saturated solution. The cell was filled with a 0.1 M HClO<sub>4</sub> solution, and electrochemical measurements were performed at 60 °C by rotating the electrode at 1600 rpm. Data were collected on a potentiostat/galvanostat, model 263A (EG&G Instruments). Materials were activated by cycling the working electrode between 0.05 and 1.15 V versus NHE until the voltammograms became stable. High-purity nitrogen, oxygen, and hydrogen (Air Liquide) were used to saturate the electrochemical cell and to test the electrocatalytic performance of the materials in various atmospheres. Cyclic voltammograms were collected at 100 mV s<sup>-1</sup> and 5 mV s<sup>-1</sup>. The specific activity per unit mass of platinum (expressed as A g<sup>-1</sup> Pt) was obtained by subtracting the cyclic voltammogram of a given material collected in a pure nitrogen atmosphere from that of the same material collected in either a pure oxygen or pure hydrogen atmosphere.

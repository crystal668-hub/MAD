**Abstract:** Alkaline fuel cells can permit the adoption of platinum group metal-free (PGM-free) catalysts and cheap bipolar plates, thus further lowering the cost. With the exploration of PGM-free hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) catalysts, nickel-based compounds have been considered as the most promising HOR catalysts in alkali. Here we report an interfacial engineering through the formation of nickel-vanadium oxide (Ni/ $V_2O_3$ ) heterostructures to activate Ni for efficient HOR catalysis in alkali. The strong electron transfer from Ni to  $V_2O_3$  could modulate the electronic structure of Ni sites. The optimal Ni/ $V_2O_3$  catalyst exhibits a high intrinsic activity of 0.038 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> and outstanding stability. Experimental and theoretical studies reveal that Ni/ $V_2O_3$  interface as the active sites can enable to optimize the hydrogen and hydroxyl bindings, as well as protect metallic Ni from extensive oxidation, thus achieving the notable activity and durability.

#### Introduction

Hydrogen proton-exchange-membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) technology has been developed rapidly in commercial application of fuel cell cars, and this technology provides a clean energy conversion that directly converts hydrogen energy into electricity with zero-emission. [1] However, the large-scale implementation of the fuel cell cars is severely restricted by the scarce and high-cost platinum group metal (PGM) catalysts, because PEMFCs depend heavily on the PGM catalysts for negotiating the sluggish oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) in cathode. [2] As an alternative, anion exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs) have recently obtained much attention and exciting developments as the ORR catalysis can adopt efficient PGM-free electrocatalysts to replace PGM-based materials when switching the operating environment from an acid to alkali. [2,3] Nevertheless, the

activity of anodic hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) on PGM catalysts in alkaline media is very sluggish as much as two to three orders of magnitude slower than that in acidic media. [4] It consequently requires the increased PGM loadings at the anode to obtain the similar catalytic performance, offsetting the reduced cost from adopting the low-cost PGM-free cathodes. Therefore, the exploration and development of PGM-free HOR catalysts with high performance in alkaline electrolytes is the prerequisite for the success of AEMFC technology.

Enormous efforts and attempts have been devoted to exploring alkaline PGM-free HOR catalysts, whereas few active catalysts have been reported. [2a,5] Currently, most studies of PGM-free HOR catalysts are focused on nickel (Ni)-based compounds, which have been considered as the most promising PGM-free catalysts for alkaline HOR catalysis. [2a,6] Although there is the lack of a conclusive

mechanism for HOR in alkaline electrolytes,[7] it is widely accepted that both hydrogen binding energy (HBE) and OH binding energy (OHBE) are the important descriptors for alkaline HOR activity.[8] One possible limitation of the poor HOR activity for Ni metal is the relatively strong HBE, which causes the high energy barrier for H2O formation in Volmer step.[8d,9] Some HOR catalysts, such as NiMo,[10] MoNi4 and WNi4, [8e] NiCu,[11] CoNiMo,[12] and Ni5.2WCu2.2[13] have been employed to weaken the HBE of Ni species by alloying Ni with other metals, thus improving the HOR activity. Besides HBE, the optimization of OHBE also plays a vital role for HOR catalysis, because the OH adsorption on Ni sites can cause the inefficient OH release and easily occupy the sites for H adsorption.[8a,b,d, 14] Therefore, some studies have proposed to optimize the OH adsorption sites by modifying the surface with metal oxides.[8d,g,15] In general, the optimization of HBE and OHBE is not mutually exclusive and can synergistically gain the activity improvement.[8d,13] In spite of these progresses, their HOR activities are still much inferior to those of PGM-based catalysts and highly needed to be improved. Moreover, Nibased HOR catalysts usually exhibited an unsatisfactory long-term durability, which is mainly due to the easy oxidation of metallic Ni under the HOR operation condition.[2a,16] Therefore, there is great need to design the novel structure of Ni-based catalysts with excellent HOR activity and durability in alkaline electrolytes.

Herein, we demonstrate an interfacial engineering approach to design a low-cost Ni/V2O3 heterostructure catalyst, which can efficiently and stably catalyze the HOR in alkaline media. The Ni/V2O3 catalyst yields a high intrinsic exchange current density of 0.038 mAcm <sup>2</sup> , much better than single Ni and V2O3 catalysts. Moreover, this Ni/ V2O3 heterostructure catalyst exhibits excellent stability with 98.5% retention of initial HOR current density after a 16 h continuous operation. Such exceptional performance renders Ni/V2O3 the best among all the reported PGM-free HOR catalysts. Experimental results and theoretical calculations reveal that the prominent HOR reactivity and durability can be attributed to Ni/V2O3 interface sites that can optimize the hydrogen and hydroxyl bindings and stabilize the metallic reactive sites under harsh hydroxyl-rich environment.

#### *Results and Discussion*

Although Ni/V2O3 heterostructures have been reported as the hydrogen evolution reaction electrocatalysts for water splitting,[17] the application of Ni/V2O3 as an efficient and stable HOR catalyst to suppress the extensive oxidation of Ni has never been explored. We first synthesized the Ni V hydroxide nanosheet arrays on nickel foam (NF) through the hydrothermal treatment of NiCl2 ·6H2O, VCl3 and urea in deionized water at 180 °C for 8 h (see more details in the Supporting Information). Then, the tawny product on NF was annealed at 400 °C in hydrogen/argon (5%/95%) atmosphere to form Ni/V2O3 heterostructure (Figure 1a). During the thermal reduction treatment, Ni-based hydroxide

can be easily reduced to metallic Ni but V-based hydroxide becomes its oxide phase. The homogeneous Ni and V distribution of initial Ni V hydroxide precursor (Supporting Information, Figures S1 and S2) is beneficial to the in situ growth of Ni nanoparticles on V2O3 to form abundant interfaces during post-reduction process.

The obtained Ni/V2O3 catalyst gives porous morphology with abundant interfaces composed of porous V2O3 nanosheets and anchoring Ni nanoparticles, as imaged by scanning electron microscopy (SEM; Figure 1b; Supporting Information, Figure S3) and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM; Figure 1c). The Ni/V2O3 catalyst yields a Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area of 22.8 m2 g <sup>1</sup> (Supporting Information, Figure S4). High-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) image clearly displayed distinct Ni/V2O3 interface with resolved lattice fringes of Ni(1 11) and V2O3(1 20) (Figure 1d). The corresponding fast Fourier transform (FFT) showed diffraction patterns oriented to the [110] direction for Ni and [42 1] direction for V2O3 (Figure 1e,f; Supporting Information, Figure S5). This means that the exposed facets of Ni and V2O3 are {110} and {30-8}, respectively (Supporting Information, Figure S5). Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) elemental mappings (Figure 1g) reveal an interlaced spatial distribution of Ni, V and O elements, and abundant Ni/V2O3 interfaces can be clearly observed, deriving from the in situ Ni migration from original precursors during annealing process. The molar ratio of Ni:V for Ni/V2O3 catalyst was

determined to be �2.3: 1 from inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) measurements, close to that of �2.45 :1 from EDX analysis (Supporting Information, Figure S6). X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern (Supporting Information, Figure S7) further displayed that Ni/V2O3 catalyst has the typical diffraction peaks from cubic Ni phase (JCPDS no. 04-0850) and hexagonal V2O3 phase (JCPDS no. 34-0187). For comparison, single Ni and V2O3 samples were also synthesized through the similar method (Supporting Information, Figures S7 and S8).

Then we use X-ray absorption spectroscopy to investigate the chemical environment of Ni and V in the bulk (Figure 2a; Supporting Information, Figure S9). The X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and extended Xray absorption fine-structure (EXAFS) spectra of the Ni Kedge show that Ni/V2O3 and single Ni have a similar Ni chemical structure with Ni foil reference, but are clearly different with NiO reference, indicating their metallic Ni nature. Meanwhile, Ni/V2O3 and single V2O3 display the similar XANES and EXAFS spectra with commercial V2O3 reference at V K-edge, which gives a bulk V oxidation state of +3 in the Ni/V2O3 and single V2O3 catalysts. To further detect the surface electronic structure of the heterostructure catalysts, we compared the X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) of Ni 2p and V 2p spectra (Figure 2b,c; Supporting Information, Figure S10). As shown in Figure 2b, Ni/V2O3 displays a positive core level shift of 0.3 eV in the 2p binding energy of metallic Ni0 compared with single Ni. The deconvolutions of Ni 2p3/2 region shows that the Ni<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup>/Ni0 ratios are 52.3/47.4 for Ni/V2O3 catalyst and 43.1/56.9 for single Ni catalyst, indicating the increased surface Ni valence state in Ni/V2O3 composite catalyst after introducing V2O3 species. Meanwhile, V 2p XPS spectra give the negativeshifted V 2p3/2 peak of about 0.4 eV for Ni/V2O3 relative to V2O3 catalyst (Figure 2c; Supporting Information, Figure S10), which was supported by a lower surface V oxidation state of +3.28 in Ni/V2O3 compared with that of +3.34 in V2O3 determined from the deconvolutions of V 2p3/2 XPS spectra. These results indicate the obvious electron transfer from metallic Ni to V2O3 through abundant interfaces in the Ni/V2O3 system. O 1s XPS spectra further showed the formation of Ni O V bond in the Ni/V2O3 interface (Figure S11). This electron transfer process was further observed from the Ni and V L-edge electron energy loss spectra (EELS) for Ni/V2O3 catalyst (Figure 2d, e). The L2/L3 ratio in EELS associates with the d-band occupancy, and the higher L2/L3 ratio means the increased oxidation state of elements.[18] As shown in Figure 2d and Figure 2e, EELS measured at the Ni/V2O3 interface sites show a higher L2/L3 ratio in Ni L-edge and a lower L2/L3 ratio in V L-edge compared with those of away from the interface sites, indicating the increased Ni oxidation state and the decreased V oxidation state at the Ni/V2O3 interface. The EELS results again confirm the electron donation from Ni to V at the Ni/ V2O3 interface, consistent with the above XPS results. To explore the driving force of electron transfer, we perform Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) to identity the difference of work functions for these catalysts (Figure 2f). The KPFM results reveal that a smaller work function is observed on Ni (4.24 eV) compared with V2O3 (4.96 eV), which thus naturally facilitates the electron transfer from Ni to V2O3 after the formation of Ni/V2O3 heterostructure with a moderate work function (4.5 eV).[19] Taken together, we demonstrate the modulated electronic structure of Ni sites

after introducing V2O3 species, which could further tailor and optimize the HOR performances.

The HOR performance was evaluated in H2-saturated 0.1 M KOH electrolyte using a typical three-electrode configuration. To study the intrinsic HOR activity of catalysts, we first loaded Ni/V2O3, Ni, or V2O3 powder catalyst with Nafion binder on glassy carbon rotating-disk electrode (RDE) for HOR tests by ultrasonication of them from NF substrates. Commercial Pt/C (20 weight%) reference on RDE was also tested for comparison. We set a slow sweep rate of 1 mVs <sup>1</sup> to minimize the capacitive current for a steady-state measurement. Unless stated otherwise, *i*Rcorrection (*i*, current; R, resistance) was conducted for all the electrochemical data reported here for the uncompensated Ohmic drop.

Linear sweep voltammetry was conducted to obtain HOR polarization curves for various catalysts on RDE with an electrode rotating speed of 2500 r.p.m. in Figure 3a. Ni/ V2O3 catalyst possesses an onset potential as low as 0 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), beyond which a rapid increase of anodic current was observed, indicating its prominent energetics for HOR in alkaline electrolyte. By contrast, the single Ni catalyst yields only slight HOR activity and V2O3 gives almost no anodic current. Notably the HOR activity of Ni/V2O3 approachs 20% Pt/C catalyst.

We then investigated the HOR kinetic parameters for the studied catalysts on RDE. The HOR polarization curves recorded at various electrode rotating speeds showed that the Koutecky–Levich plot has a slope of 5.2 cm2mA <sup>1</sup> s 1/2 for Ni/V2O3 catalyst at 50 mV overpotential (Supporting Information, Figure S12), reasonably close to the theoretical value of 4.87 cm2mA <sup>1</sup> s 1/2 for the two-electron HOR process.[9] Then we could obtain the kinetic current density of 4.74 mAcmgeo <sup>2</sup> for Ni/V2O3 catalyst at 50 mV overpotential from the intercept of Koutecky–Levich plot (Supporting Information, Figure S12b). Therefore the mass activity of Ni/V2O3 catalyst is 42.1 mAmgNi <sup>1</sup> based on the kinetic current density at 50 mV overpotential, much higher than that of single Ni catalyst (Figure 3b; Supporting Information, Table S1). Moverover, to evaluate the intrinsic HOR activities of the studied catalysts, we further investigated electrochemical surface area (ECSA) normalized exchange current density (ECSA-normalized j0) through the linear fitting of the micropolarization region or the fitting of Butler–Volmer equation (Figure 3b; Supporting Information, Figures S13–S16). Ni/V2O3 catalyst has a ECSAnormalized j0 of 0.038 mAcmECSA <sup>2</sup> , which is higher than single Ni catalyst (0.0095 mAcmECSA <sup>2</sup> ), as well as most of previously documented Ni-based HOR catalysts (Table S1).

The Ni/V2O3, Ni, or V2O3 catalyst grown on NF with a geometric area of �1 cm<sup>2</sup> was also used as the working electrode directly without adding any additives for HOR activity measurements. As shown in Figure 3c, the HOR activity of Ni/V2O3 favourably overwhelms that of single Ni or V2O3 catalyst, and is close to Pt/C catalyst, indicating the notable HOR activity. The remarkable HOR activity is consistent with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurement that gives a small charge transfer resistance of about 3 Ohms on Ni/V2O3 catalyst at 30 mV versus RHE (Supporting Information, Figure S17).

We also performed control experiments by tuning the annealing temperatures and the molar ratios of Ni:V to optimize the HOR activity. For example, the best HOR

performance is achieved on the sample annealed at 400 °C (Figure 3d), which could be due to the abundant Ni/V2O3 interfaces formed at this temperature. For the sample annealed at 300 °C, the decomposition of Ni V hydroxide is at the initial stage, and only Ni nanoparticles is formed on the imporous nanosheets and no V2O3 phase is generated (Supporting Information, Figure S18). Therefore, the absence of Ni/V2O3 interface leads to the poor HOR activity for sample annealed at 300 °C. Nevertheless, a higher annealing temperature (500°C) results in the severe aggregation of nanoparticles and the increased particle size, thus yielding the decreased Ni/V2O3 interfaces and the weakened HOR activity. In addition, we also found that the molar ratio of Ni:V has a prominent effect on the HOR activity and the HOR activity exhibits a volcano-shaped dependence on the molar ratio of Ni:V ranging from 13.4 : 1 to 1.3: 1 (Figure 3e; Supporting Information, Figures S19 and S20). The catalyst with a Ni:V molar ratio of 2.3 :1 has the highest interface density and the best HOR activity, as both too low or too high Ni:V molar ratios will result in reducing the amount of interface sites and thus decreasing the HOR activity (Supporting Information, Figures S19 and S20).

The CO tolerance of HOR catalysts is an important parameter for practical hydrogen fuel cells, as PGM catalysts (such as Pt metal) are readily poisoned by residual CO gas.[20] The preferential CO adsorption on Pt will block the active site for further hydrogen adsorption and dissociation, leading to the deteriorative HOR activity. Therefore, we evaluated the HOR activity of Ni/V2O3 and Pt/C catalysts in the presence of CO (Figure 3f). Unexpectedly, our Ni/V2O3 catalyst still retains the exciting HOR activity even in the presence of 1000 ppm CO. However, Pt/C catalyst loss most of HOR activity under the same condition, which is consistent with the previous report that Pt/C catalyst is easily poisoned by CO even at very low CO content.[20, 21] This result demonstrates the superior CO tolerance for Ni/ V2O3 catalyst.

Compared to the poor HOR activity for Ni and V2O3 counterparts, the very high HOR activity was observed on the Ni/V2O3 heterostructure catalyst, which motivates us to elucidate the intrinsic mechanism behind it. Although the conclusive mechanism for alkaline HOR is still debated, many recent studies showed that both HBE and OHBE are thought to be the important activity descriptor for HOR catalysis in alkaline electrolytes.[8a–f] Therefore, we performed several experimental characterizations as well as density functional theory (DFT) calculations for the indepth investigations of the HBE and OHBE changes after the formation of Ni/V2O3 interface catalysts.

We first employed ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) to study the electronic structures. As shown in Figure 4a, the valence band spectra show that the metal *d* band of our Ni/V2O3 catalyst shifts far away from the Fermi level (*E*F) as compared to the Ni catalyst, which will improve the filling of metal-H antibonding states. According to the d-band theory, the filling of metal-H antibonding states means the weak hydrogen adsorption and thus the introduction of V2O3 into Ni to form the Ni/V2O3 heterostructure can decrease HBE of Ni metal.[8e,22] Previous works have

ascribed the poor HOR activity for Ni metal to its strong HBE in alkaline media.[8d,9] Our results here suggest that the appropriately weakened HBE on Ni/V2O3 catalyst could be responsible for its high HOR reactivity. Meanwhile, the too positive *d* band of V2O3 catalyst leads to the too weak metal-H binding to dissociate hydrogen molecule, causing the very sluggish HOR kinetics for V2O3 catalyst.

Next, we employed CO-stripping experiments to detect the OH adsorption on our catalyst surfaces. Because the OH adsorption can facilitate the removal of the CO\* (adsorbed CO), the tough CO stripping (CO electrooxidation) means the weak OH adsorption.[13, 23] CO-stripping curve displays the CO\* oxidation potential located at 0.71 V for Pt/C catalyst (Supporting Information, Figure S21), agreeing with the previous report.[23] By contrast, the Ni metal oxidizes CO\* at 0.59 V, and Ni/V2O3 and V2O3 catalysts have a similar CO-stripping peak at about 0.37 V (Figure 4b; Supporting Information, Figure S21). These results show that Ni/V2O3 has a stronger OHBE than Ni and Pt/C catalysts. Some prior studies have proposed that the sluggish HOR kinetics on Pt in alkali is caused by its weak OHBE.[8a,b] Therefore, we can partially attribute the excellent HOR activity observed on Ni/V2O3 catalyst to the enhanced OHBE. In addition, the CO-stripping experiments also show that Ni/V2O3 catalyst has weak ability for CO adsorption compared to Pt/C catalyst, consistent with the above observation with excellent CO tolerance (Figure 3f).

Furthermore, DFT calculations were performed to simulate the adsorption energy of reaction intermediates during the HOR process. We first optimized the catalyst models of Ni(110), Ni(110)/V2O3, and V2O3(30-8) as the representative catalytic surfaces for calculations (Figure 4c; Supporting Information, Figures S22 and S23), because they were the exposed facets as revealed by the HRTEM studies

*Angewandte*

(Figure 1d–f; Supporting Information, Figure S5),. DFT results give a HBE of 0.61 eV on Ni(110) surface (Figure 4d), which is too strong that causes high energy barrier for H2O formation in Volmer step, in agreement with previous studies.[8d, 9] For Pt catalyst, although it has an appropriate HBE value of 0.47 eV, the OHBE is too weak on Pt(111) surface. Our DFT calculations further reveal that Ni/V2O3 catalyst has an optimized HBE value close to Pt(111) and a stronger OHBE relative to Pt(111). Therefore, Ni/V2O3 catalyst possesses the near-optimal HBE and OHBE (Figure 4d), accelerating the HOR kinetics. For comparison, we also calculated the HBE and OHBE of V2O3 catalyst, which has too weak HBE of about 0.24 eV to adsorb the hydrogen molecules. Taken together, our above experimental and theoretical studies reveal that the Ni/V2O3 heterostructure interface enables to optimize the adsorption of hydrogen and hydroxyl intermediates, thereby synergistically promoting the HOR activity in alkaline electrolytes.

Apart from activity, the long-term durability of HOR catalyst is another critical metric for the practical application of hydrogen anode. We thus conducted an aggressive longterm stability by means of chronoamperometry (*j*~*t*) at 70 mV versus RHE in H2-saturated 0.1 M KOH electrolytes at room temperature. Figure 5a shows that Ni/V2O3 catalyst possesses the impressive stability and can maintain 98.5% of its initial HOR current density after a 16 h continuous test; whereas no HOR current was observed in Ar-saturated 0.1 M KOH at the same condition (Supporting Information, Figure S24), confirming that the anodic current in Figure 5a completely comes from the hydrogen oxidation. In contrast, Ni metal loses 90% of initial activity after only 3 hours. Meanwhile, the stability of our Ni/V2O3 catalyst is substantially superior to that of Pt/C catalyst in which only 75% of initial current remains after stability test. We note that Nibased materials, as one of the most important and promising PGM-free HOR catalysts, usually exhibit the unsatisfactory HOR stability, which is mainly due to the easy oxidation of metallic Ni sites under the positive potential of HOR condition.[2a,6b, 16] The HOR stability of our Ni/V2O3 catalyst reported here is very remarkable, making the potential of Ni/V2O3 catalyst as the high active and durable PGM-free HOR catalyst.

To understand the origin of the excellent HOR stability for Ni/V2O3 catalyst, we investigated the structural and electronic features of catalysts after HOR stability tests by multiple characterization techniques. The SEM image and XRD pattern demonstrate the well-maintained morphology and phase of Ni/V2O3 catalyst after HOR test (Supporting Information, Figure S25). Furthermore, Figure 5b–e and Figure S26 illustrate another critical observation that we want to demonstrate in this work: that is, the local Ni sites near the Ni/V2O3 interface are well maintained from extensive oxidation for Ni/V2O3 catalyst. The HRTEM image, EDX mappings and corresponding line-scan profiles show that although the local Ni sites away from the Ni/V2O3 interface suffers the oxidation by oxygen species, the Ni oxidation around the Ni/V2O3 interface is substantially suppressed even after a 16 h continuous stability test. These results are totally different from the complete oxidation of Ni sites for single Ni catalyst after only 5 h stability test (Supporting Information, Figure S27) due to the passivation from metal hydroxide formation,[6a] suggesting the suppressive Ni oxidation through the formation of Ni/V2O3 interface. We also calculated the O adsorption energy to compare the oxidation resistance of Ni/V2O3 and Ni catalysts

by DFT simulations (Figure 5e). These results show that O species prefer to adsorb on Ni catalyst with a low O adsorption energy of 0.15 eV, whereas such adsorption on Ni/V2O3 interface (0.34 eV) is much weaker, demonstrating that the Ni/V2O3 is more difficult to be oxidized as compared to single Ni. Therefore, these postmortem characterizations and theoretical calculations show that Ni/V2O3 catalysts can protect the metallic Ni from excessive oxidation under the alkaline HOR conditions, thus leading to the excellent HOR durability.

#### *Conclusion*

In summary, we report a significant development in PGMfree alkaline HOR catalysis on the basis of Ni/V2O3 heterostructure with abundant interfaces. The unprecedented HOR activity and durability of this interface catalyst outperform that of most of PGM-free alkaline HOR catalysts reported previously. We attribute such prominent HOR performance for Ni/V2O3 catalyst to the interfacial engineering, which can optimize the adsorption of hydrogen and hydroxyl intermediates to synergistically accelerate the sluggish HOR kinetics, and can also stabilize the metallic Ni active sites to promote the long-term durability in alkaline electrolytes. Our study reveals the significance of a multicomponent design strategy through interfacial engineering for developing platinum group metal-free, efficient and stable HOR electrocatalysts.

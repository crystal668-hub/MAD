**Amorphous alloys have multiple advantages in electrocatalysis, yet the isotropic nature makes their syntheses a great obstacle in application. In this work, it is shown that the Zn2<sup>+</sup> can interfere with the crystallization of Pd-base structures to form amorphous alloy materials. By simply adjusting the Zn<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> content, unique PdZnS amorphous hollow spheres (AHS) with various compositions and degrees of crystallinity can be obtained through a facile one-pot wet chemical method. Owing to both the amorphous nature and hollow morphologies, the PdZnS AHSs possess appealing activities and stabilities as oxygen reduction catalysts. Typically, the Pd20ZnS10 AHSs exhibit the highest half-wave potential (***E***1/2) of 0.940 V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode), and such** *E***1/2 only negatively shifts 25 mV after 60 000 cycles.**

## **1. Introduction**

Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is the key electrochemical process in the future energy-conversion devices such as the protonexchange-membrane fuel cells (PEMFC). Plenty research efforts have devoted to develop active and stable ORR catalysts to replace the benchmarking Pt/C, whose high cost and relatively low activity had become the bottle-neck for the large-scale application of PEMFCs.[1]

Amorphous alloys have recently been identified as a promising catalyst candidate.[2] Being also known as the metallic glass, they have no long-range periodicity in the atomic structure, and thus possess distinct physical and chemical properties compared to metal crystals. In particular, the isotropic nature of the amorphous alloy eliminates the crystalline defects such as grain boundaries, dislocations, and phase segregations, allowing uniform distribution of catalytic active sites.[3] The anticorrosion

property of the amorphous alloy gives rise to their superior stabilities over the corresponding crystalline alloys in electrocatalytic processes.[4] Lastly, many electrocatalyst needs to be activated via surface redox reaction or leaching process; the highentropy nature of the amorphous alloy can accelerate these processes.[3a]

On the other hand, synthesis and stabilization of amorphous alloy remain quite challenging. In particular, the strong metallic bonds of the noble metals favor the formation of the metal crystals. Their amorphous states are generally unstable, and unless stabilized with strong ligands, they would quickly transform into crystalline structures in solution.[4c] Amorphous

materials can be synthesized via rapid cooling methods, including the arc-melting,[5] melt-spinning,[6] and exfoliation,[7] or by inducing the rearrangement of atoms with heterogeneous doping,[8] ligand exchange,[9] ball-milling,[10] and electrochemical depositions.[11] For example, the Pd3P2S8 crystal can be transformed into amorphous solids with an electrochemical lithiumization process.[12] The Li<sup>+</sup> would insert into the crystalline layers and destroy the lattice structures. Some physical methods such as electrospinning[13] and atomic layered deposition[14] can also be utilized to form amorphous materials. However, these methods usually requires complex instruments and procedures, and can only generate metallic glasses with sizes about several hundreds of nanometers.

There are only a few cases that employ wet chemical methods to synthesize amorphous nanomaterials with well-defined morphologies. This is because the amorphous structures are in the metastable states, and the phase transition from amorphous to crystalline can easily occur in the wet chemical environments.[4c] Moreover, the structure isotropy of the amorphous materials provides few mechanisms for anisotropic growth in the morphological controlled synthesis. Thus, despite the rapid development of the wet chemical synthesis, the syntheses for amorphous Pd-based nanostructures is limited. Recently, Zhang et al. synthesized Pd nanosheets containing the mixed crystalline phase and amorphous phase, and the crystallinity of the nanosheets would vary with the reaction temperature;[15] and Yang et al. reported a two-step sulfurization strategy to induce the conversion of crystalline Pd nanoplates into amorphous structures.[16] Both works demonstrated the structural advantage of the amorphous Pd nanostructures as catalyst materials.

Herein, we report a one-pot wet-chemical synthesis of PdZnS amorphous alloy with hollow spherical morphology. The formation of the amorphous alloy was induced by the introduction of Zn<sup>2+</sup> during the synthesis of the crystalline Pd<sub>4</sub>S hollow nanospheres. The formation process and the principle of the amorphization method was investigated. A series of PdZnS amorphous hollow spheres (AHSs) with different crystallinity and atomic compositions were synthesized and their performance as ORR catalysts were characterized. It was found that, the  $Pd_{20}ZnS_{10}$  AHS, formed with the feed ratio of Pd:Zn = 10:1, exhibited the highest half-wave potential of 0.940 V versus RHE and outstanding stability in the accelerated durability test (ADT), with the half-wave potential only negatively shifted about 25 mV after 60 000 cycles.

#### 2. Results and Discussion

To synthesize the PdZnS AHSs (typically the Pd<sub>20</sub>ZnS<sub>10</sub> AHSs), the Pd precursor (Na<sub>2</sub>PdCl<sub>4</sub>,  $1.62 \times 10^{-3}$  M) and Zn precursor  $(Zn(OAc)_2, 0.162 \times 10^{-3} \text{ m})$  were firstly dissolved in a mixed solvent of N, N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and ethylene glycol (EG) (v/ v = 3: 2) containing KOH (1.79  $\times$  10<sup>-3</sup> M) and L-cysteine (1.62  $\times$  10<sup>-3</sup> M) to form a clear pale yellow solution. The reaction mixture was heated in a 150 °C oil bath for 1 h, during which the color of the mixture gradually changed from pale yellow to colorless, and then become brownish and finally formed black opaque solutions containing large precipitates. The black precipitates obtained were collected with centrifugation, and washed with ethanol before subjected to characterizations.

The morphology and the structure of the PdZnS AHSs (Pd<sub>20</sub>ZnS<sub>10</sub>, with the Pd/Zn feeding ratio of 10:1) were characterized in Figure 1. From the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image, it can be observed that the as-synthesized PdZnS AHSs have relatively uniform diameters of 120-160 nm. Due to the aggregation during the synthesis, some spheres were staggered together. From the occasionally broken samples, it can be deduced that they are hollow spheres. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image confirms the structures are hollow spheres with shell thickness of 10–14 nm (Figure 1c). The shells are made of small particle grains, and the surfaces of the hollow sphere were thus slightly rough. From the energy-dispersive Xray (EDS) analysis, it was found that the hollow spheres contain uniformly distributed Pd, Zn, and S elements, with the atomic ratio of 20:1:10 (Figure 1g and Figure S1, Supporting Information). And the composition was also confirmed with the ICP-MS results.

The structure of the PdZnS AHSs was further investigated with high-resolution TEM (HRTEM). From the HRTEM image, the PdZnS AHSs still appear as porous shell made of small grains (Figure 1d<sub>1</sub>). However, it is surprise that no recognizable lattice fringes could be observed on the grains (Figure 1e), suggesting that they are not crystalline domain. Such noncrystalline property was confirmed by the selected area electron diffraction pattern (SAED, Figure 1d<sub>2</sub>) and the X-ray diffraction (XRD) results (Figure 1f). The SAED pattern of one complete hollow sphere shows blurred rings; And instead of the characteristics peaks in the crystalline materials, the XRD result only shows a very broad and low intensity peak around 40°. The characteristic peaks for neither metallic Pd, metallic Zn, alloy PdZn nor the sulfides of the two metals could be observed. Based on these characterizations, it can be concluded that the Pd<sub>20</sub>ZnS<sub>10</sub> AHSs were amorphous in nature.

The composition of the PdZnS AHSs was further characterized with the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Figure S2, Supporting Information). The existence of the Pd, Zn, and S elements can be confirmed by the respective characteristic peaks. Deconvolution of the Pd 3d peaks at 335.93 eV (3d<sub>3/2</sub>) and 341.18 eV (3d<sub>5/2</sub>) indicates the presence of both metallic Pd (0) and Pd2+ species, while Zn exists mostly as Zn2+, as indicated by the Zn 2p peaks at 1022.07 eV  $(2p_{3/2})$  and 1045.02 eV  $(2p_{1/2})$ (Figure S1b,c, Supporting Information). This is because Zn<sup>2+</sup> has much lower reduction potential  $(E^{\theta}(Zn^{2+}/Zn) = -0.7626 \text{ V vs})$ SHE) compared to  $Pd^{2+}$  ( $E^{\theta}(Pd^{2+}/Pd) = 0.91 \text{ V vs SHE}$ ). It seems that the Zn<sup>2+</sup> could not be effectively reduced by the reductants in this low temperature synthesis under ambient condition. The S element in the AHSs was characterized existing as the  $S^{2-}$ . The oxidation states of Pd and S are almost the same as those in the Pd<sub>4</sub>S hollow spheres formed with crystalline domains (Figure S3, Supporting Information).

The composition of the PdZnS AHSs can be readily adjusted by varying the feeding ratio of the metal precursors. The Zn content in the AHSs would increase accordingly (but not proportional) when the Zn precursor ratio was increased. It is found that as the feeding ratio of Pd:Zn varied from 4:1 to 1000:1, similar hollow spheres were obtained, with only the shell of the hollow spheres become increasingly porous and the gain sizes gradually increased (Figure 2a-c). When the feeding ratio of Zn increased to Pd:Zn = 1:1, sheet-like aggregates with low contrast appeared attaching to the surface of the hollow spheres (Figure 2d). The amount of such aggregates generally increases with the Zn feeding ratio. The XRD results of the sample with excess Zn precursors (Pd:Zn = 1:10) shows faint peak of ZnO, suggesting these sheet-like species are ZnO with bad crystallinity (Figure S4, Supporting Information). Obviously, the excess amount of Zn would form ZnO and segregate from the AHSs.

On the other hand, although the hollow morphology was maintained when the Zn content decreased, the XRD characterization indicates that the crystallinity of the PdZnS AHNs varies with the Pd: Zn compositions (Figure 2e). Similar to the surface grain sizes, the crystallinity of the hollow spheres gradually increased as the Zn feeding ratio decreased. As the feeding molarity of Zn decreased to 1/60 to that of the Pd precursor, peaks of crystalline tetragonal Pd<sub>4</sub>S appeared in the XRD spectrum. Further decreasing of Zn percentage would result in the sharpening of the Pd<sub>4</sub>S peaks, indicating the increasing of the crystallinity. Finally, crystalline Pd<sub>4</sub>S hollow sphere would be obtained in absence of the Zn precursors. The threshold Zn feeding percentage for the crystallization can be as low as 1/50 of Pd, i.e., the crystallization of Pd<sub>4</sub>S would be interfered by only 2% of Zn<sup>2+</sup> in the reaction mix-

To further explore the formation and the amorphization mechanism of the PdZnS AHSs, the intermediates at different states of the reaction were captured and characterized (Figure 3a-c). The reaction mixture would turn brownish after heating in the oil bath for 90 s. The intermediates captured at this stage were solid and smooth aggregates with the diameters around 130 nm (Figure 3a). EDS results indicates the solid spheres are made

of Pd, Zn, S, O, C, and N elements, suggesting they are the insoluble coordination complexes formed by Pd2<sup>+</sup>, Zn<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup>, and the l-cysteine ligands (Figure S5, Supporting Information). Continuing heating at this temperature would lead to the formation of black opaque solution at 5 min reaction time, signifying the reduction of Pd. The precipitates collected at this stage were solid spheres, whose surface were decorated with a layer of small particles (Figure 3b). The surface particles would gradually increase in both sizes and numbers, as the solid sphere become hollow in the following heating process. At 30 min, uniform porous spheres with diameters around 130–140 nm could be obtained. Finally, hollow spheres with distinctive interiors can be obtained at 1 h (Figure 3c).

Such formation procedure is similar to our previously reported Pd4S hollow spheres.[17] The consistence of the diameters of the solid spheres at 90 s and the final AHSs also suggests a selftemplating process of the hollow structures in this work. After initiating the reaction with heating, the l-cysteine in the reaction mixture would firstly coordinate with Pd<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> and Zn<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> to form the insoluble templates. The Pd would then be reduced, together with the decomposition of the cysteine as the S source. The reduction and deposition of PdZnS would start from the surface of the template, and the interior species in the solid intermediates diffused outwards and deposited at the surface to form the shell structure during the reduction step. Most of the organic component of the intermediate template would dissolve during the formation of the hollow structures. A thermogravitational analysis of the PdZnS AHSs (with the feeding ratio of Pd:Zn = 1:1) shows only 5% of mass loss around 400 °C due to the loss of S, indicating there is little organic component in the PdZnS AHSs (Figure S6, Supporting Information).

Control experiments were designed to further investigate the role of Zn<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> and its correlation to the formation of the amorphous alloys. First, the Zn precursor was replaced with ZnCl2 and Zn(NO3)2 to verify if the anion has any effect on the formation of amorphous structures. With different Zn precursors, the hollow morphology in the products was compromised (Figure S7, Supporting Information). Nevertheless, the XRD results indicated that the crystallinity of the porous spheres obtained with ZnCl2 and Zn(NO3)2 was similar to the PdZnS AHSs formed with the Zn(OAc)2 (Figure S8, Supporting Information), demonstrating that the Zn2<sup>+</sup> is the key factor that induces the amorphization in the AHSs. Secondly, if there were no Pd precursor, the Zn(OAc)2 as the sole metal precursor would give only transparent solution after the same reaction procedure. XRD result of the white precipitates collected after centrifugation also shows no crystalline peaks, indicating no nanocrystal would precipitate in absence of Pd (Figure S9, Supporting Information). We then attempted to carry out the reaction with only Pd precursor at the beginning, and added equivalent amount of Zn(OAc)2 into the reaction mixture at various stages. It was found that, if the Zn precursor was added after the solution turning to brownish (i.e., 90 s after the heating started, at which the intermediate solid templates forms), the obtained PdZnS AHSs had almost the same morphology and crystallinity to those formed with both metal precursors initially mixed (Figure 3d,f). On the other hand, if the Zn precursor were added 5 min after the reaction started, the resulting product were crystalline Pd4S hollow spheres (confirmed with the XRD analysis, Figure 3f), with sheet-like aggregates attached to the polycrystalline hollow spheres (Figure 3e). Such difference in the products indicates that the Zn<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> does not have to be present in the metal-l-cysteine solid templates in order to interfere the formation of the Pd4S. In contrast, the presence of Zn2<sup>+</sup> during the Pd reduction and deposition process is of critical importance, probably because Zn<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> would interact strongly with both Pd and S<sup>2</sup><sup>−</sup> to form ZnS or PdZn alloys.

The strong interaction between the Zn<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> and Pd and/or S may also explain the improved structural and chemical stability of the PdZnS AHSs. The hollow spheres of the crystalline Pd4S obtained in absence of Zn would suffer severe oxidative ripening, and would gradually transform to frame-like spherical shells if the reaction were not protected by inert atmosphere (Figure S10a, Supporting Information). The increased shell grain sizes in the Pd-rich hollow spheres also demonstrated this phenomenon. In contrast, the morphology of the PdZnS AHSs would remain largely unchanged during the following heating process under the ambient condition, and even after

prolonged heating (Figure S10c, Supporting Information). Obviously, the presence of Zn2<sup>+</sup> would hinder the dynamic dissolution of Pd.

Besides Zn<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup>, other transition metal ions (M = Fe, Co, Ni, or Cu, added in 1:1 molar ratio with the Pd precursors) were also briefly screened to explore the generality of this alloying-induced synthesis of PdMS AHSs. When Zn(OAc)2 were replaced with the Cu precursors (either Cu(NO3)2, CuSO4, Cu(OAc)2, or Cu(acac)2), no regular nanostructures were obtained (Figure S11, Supporting Information), probably because the positive redox potential of Cu2<sup>+</sup>/Cu would disturb the reduction and nucleation of the Pd nanostructures. Oppositely, replacing Zn with Fe, Co and Ni precursors would allow the formation of spherical Pdbased nanostructures, though some may not be hollow due to the change of reaction kinetics (Figure S12a–c, Supporting Information). XRD results indicate that the structures obtained with either Fe, Co, or Ni had low crystallinity as the PdZnS AHSs (Figure S12d,e, Supporting Information). Thus, the ion-induced approach for amorphourization is general for some of the transition metal ions. It is speculated that in order for the transition metal ion to induce the formation of the amorphous PdMS nanostructures, it should have negative redox potentials to avoid interfering the reduction of Pd, and sufficient affinity to S<sup>2</sup><sup>−</sup> to interfere the crystallization of Pd4S.

The electrocatalytic performances of three types of PdZnS (A)HSs (denoted as Pd4ZnS2, Pd20ZnS10, and Pd70ZnS30, with the Pd:Zn feeding ratio of 1:1, 10:1, and 60:1, respectively) as the ORR catalysts in alkaline condition were evaluated and compared with the Pd4S hollow spheres as well as the benchmarking Pt/C and Pd/C catalysts. The PdZnS AHSs and the Pd4S hollow spheres were loaded on carbon support (Vulcan XC-72R) and drop-casted onto the glassy carbon electrode (GCE). The ORR polarization curves of the various catalysts were recorded in O2 saturated 0.1 m KOH aqueous solution at a scan rate of 50 mV s<sup>−</sup>1, using a rotating disk electrode (RDE) with rotation rate of 1600 rpm (**Figure 4**a). The Pd70ZnS30 and Pd4ZnS2 (A)HSs have the half-wave potentials (*E*1/2) (0.892 and 0.887 V vs RHE, respectively) comparable to that of Pd4S hollow spheres (0.892 V vs RHE). And the Pd20ZnS10 AHSs exhibited the best ORR catalytic activity, with the *E*1/2 at 0.940 V (vs RHE), 64 and 23 mV more

positive than those of the commercial Pt/C (0.877 V vs RHE) and Pd/C (0.918 V vs RHE) (Figure S13, Supporting Information).

The electrochemical surface areas (ECSAs) of various catalysts were calculated by integrating the PdO (or PtO) reduction peak in the cyclic voltammetry, assuming 0.405 and 0.210 mC cm $^{-2}$  for the reduction of a monolayer of PdO and PtO on the catalyst surface, respectively (Figure S14, Supporting Information). The ECSAs of Pd<sub>4</sub>ZnS<sub>2</sub> AHSs, Pd<sub>20</sub>ZnS<sub>10</sub> AHSs, Pd<sub>70</sub>ZnS<sub>30</sub> hollow spheres, Pd<sub>4</sub>S hollow spheres, Pt/C, and Pd/C are calculated to be 14.5, 28.4, 14.9, 17.0, 53.6, and 22.3 m $^2$  g $^{-1}$ , respectively. The ECSAs of PdZnS AHSs are generally similar to that of the Pd<sub>4</sub>S hollow spheres, and smaller than those of the commercial Pt/C and Pd/C. It is noted the Pd<sub>20</sub>ZnS<sub>10</sub> AHSs possesses abnormal large ECSA, roughly twice to those of the other AHSs.

Using the Koutecky–Levich equation, the number of electrons transferred per molecule of oxygen on the  $Pd_{20}ZnS_{10}$  catalyst is calculated to be 4, indicating a four-electron direct reduction mechanism (Figure 4b). The mass activity (MA) of the  $Pd_{20}ZnS_{10}$  calculated with the kinetic currents at 0.9 V (vs RHE) is 0.493 A  $mg_{Pd}^{-1}$ , much higher than that of Pt/C (0.056 A  $mg_{Pd}^{-1}$ ),  $Pd/C(0.062\,A\,mg_{Pd}^{-1})$ , and the other two PdZnS (A)HSs (0.092 A  $mg_{Pd}^{-1}$  for  $Pd_4ZnS_2$  and 0.101 A  $mg_{Pd}^{-1}$  for  $Pd_{70}ZnS_{30}$ ) (Figure 4c). Obviously, the  $Pd_{20}ZnS_{10}$  AHSs, with low Zn content yet amorphous structure has improved ORR activity in comparison to other PdZnS hollow spheres and commercial catalysts.

To further evaluate the stability of the Pd<sub>20</sub>ZnS<sub>10</sub> AHSs catalysts, the catalysts were subjected to ADT, which carries out cyclic scans between 0.6 and 1.0 V (vs RHE) at the sweep rate

of 200 mV s<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> in the O2-saturated 0.1 m KOH aqueous solution. The ADT results suggests the Pd20ZnS10 AHSs possess enhanced electrochemical stability. While the *E*1/2 of Pt/C and Pd/C would negatively shift 26 and 11 mV after only 10 000 ADT cycles (Figure 4e), the LSV curve for the Pd20ZnS10 AHSs remained almost unchanged after the same number of scans. The *E*1/2 of the Pd20ZnS10 AHSs only negatively shifted 25 mV after 60 000 ADT cycles, and it takes more than 80 000 ADT cycles for it to drop 45 mV. Clearly, the Pd20ZnS10 AHS is the more durable ORR catalyst.

Previously, we have investigated the ORR performances of the Pd4S hollow spheres, which possess improved ORR durability owing to the hollow and porous morphology structure. Since the PdZnS AHSs have similar morphologies with the Pd4S hollow spheres, they could also benefit from similar structural robustness.

Moreover, the amorphous structure of the PdZnS AHSs and the alloying nature of Pd and Zn provide addition improvement for the catalytic durability and activity. As mentioned above, the incorporation of Zn<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> in the hollow spheres can significantly improve the stability of the hollow spheres, preventing them from the oxidation-mediated ripening. Similar effect may also apply during the catalytic cycling, and help to preserve the catalyst morphologies. Indeed, the TEM images of the Pd20ZnS10 AHSs after cycling shows that the hollow spherical morphologies and well as the fine grain sizes were well preserved after the ADT test (Figure S15, Supporting Information).

The formation of the amorphous alloy not only contribute to the stability of the Pd-based nanostructures. The Pd 3d XPS spectra can be compared to unveil the electronic structures of Pd in the various PdZnS AHSs and Pd4S hollow spheres (Figure S16, Supporting Information). Compared to the Pd4S hollow spheres, the Pd in the PdZnS AHSs is more oxidized, as indicated by the positive shifting of both 3d3/2 and 3d5/2 peaks in all PdZnS (A)HSs. Apparently, the incorporation of Zn<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> and the formation of the amorphous structure would cause the Pd in the AHSs to be more electron-deficient. However, the electron-withdrawing effect does not proportional with the Zn composition. Among all three AHSs, the Pd 3d peaks for the Pd20ZnS10 are more positively shifted than the others, and further addition of Zn would cause a reverse trend in the Pd oxidation state and the catalytic activity.

Finally, the methanol tolerance of the Pd20ZnS10 AHSs was examined by introducing 2 m of methanol half-way (at 100 s) during the chronoamperometric (*i*–*t*) measurements of both the Pd20ZnS10 AHSs and the Pt/C catalysts at 0.8 V (vs RHE). A reversed anodic current would immediately occurred after the addition of methanol on the Pt/C, suggesting that the ORR on Pt/C would be severely interfered by the methanol oxidation reaction. On the other hand, although PdZn alloy (e.g., Pd on ZnO support) can catalyze the methanol hydrogenation,[18] the ORR current of the PdZnS AHSs had only a small shift after the introduction of methanol (Figure 4f).

#### **3. Conclusion**

In conclusion, we have developed a facile way to synthesize Pd-based amorphous alloy nanostructures. Amorphous PdZnS AHSs could be obtained by introducing the Zn<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> precursors into the self-templating synthesis of the Pd-based hollow spheres. The crystallinity of the final structure was found decreasing gradually with the molar percentage of Zn in the hollow spheres. Control experiments indicated that the presence of Zn2<sup>+</sup> during the reduction and deposition stage is of critical importance for preventing the crystallization and the formation of crystalline Pd4S grains. The electrochemical performances of PdZnS AHSs with various crystallinities and compositions as the ORR electrocatalysts were also studied. Benefiting from the optimized electronic structures resulting from the formation of certain amorphous structures, the Pd20ZnS10 AHSs, which were formed with the Pd:Zn feeding ratio of 10:1, possessed improved catalytic activity and outstanding durability in alkaline condition. The co-relation between the electrochemical performance and the degree of the crystallinity of the structures provides an additional dimension for exploring high-performance catalysts. In addition, the alloyinduced amorphization strategy further advances the synthetic capability for complex and unconventional nanomaterials.

Developing efficient, economical, and durable transition metal atom-dispersed catalysts to boost the sluggish oxygen reduction reactions (ORRs) is crucial for the practical metal-air batteries. Herein, a facile dopamine-coordination strategy was developed to obtain tangled Fe, N co-doped ultrathin carbon nanosheets (donated as tangled Fe—N—C nanosheets), which can be utilized as high-performance ORR electrocatalysts. Benefited from the unique hierarchical porous structures and abundant Fe—Nx active sites, the tangled Fe—N—C nanosheets

exhibited excellent ORR activity in alkaline medium with more positive half-wave potential (0.88 V vs. RHE) than 20 wt% Pt/C (0.84 V vs. RHE). Meanwhile, the tangled Fe–N–C nanosheets exhibit excellent long-term stability and good tolerance to methanol crossover. When applying the Fe–N–C nanosheets as the cathode catalyst for primary zinc-air batteries (ZABs), the assembled cells exhibit high open circuit voltage (~1.43 V), high peak power density (~89 mW cm $^{-2}$ ) and large specific capacity of 801 mA h g $^{-1}$ .

#### Introduction

The global warming and energy crisis derived from the vast consumption of transitional fossil fuels accelerate the rapid development of new and clean energy storage and conversion devices. [1-4] Nevertheless, the commercial applications of new energy conversion devices including fuel cells and metal-air batteries are severely limited by the sluggish oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) arising from the high-activation barrier and hydrophobicity of O<sub>2</sub>. [5-7] At present, Platinum group metal (PGM)-based catalysts such as Pt/C are considered to be the most active ORR catalysts, but their widespread and large-scale applications are severely restricted by the high cost, scarcity and unsatisfied stability.[8-10] Therefore, design and synthesis of low-cost yet highly active PGM-free electrocatalysts to boost the sluggish ORR is highly desirable. Single-atom catalysts (SACs) with coordinated transition metal as catalytic centers can maximize the efficiency of metal utilization, thus achieving high activity and selectivity in relevant electrocatalytic reactions.[11-14] In particular, transition metal and nitrogen co-doped carbon based single-atom catalysts (M–N–C, where M represent Co, Fe,

and Mn etc.) with optimal activity have been widely investigated as the promising candidates of PGM-free ORR catalysts. Among various M–N–C catalysts, Fe–N–C catalysts has received intense attention particularly due to their abundant resources and ultrahigh catalytic activities towards oxygen reduction.

Owing to the high electron mobility, short ion and electron diffusion length and ultrahigh exposed surface area, twodimensional (2D) carbon materials can be widely served as powerful supports for M-N-C based catalysts.[20-22] In this regard, anchoring isolated metal atoms on 2D carbon nanomaterials is expected to ensure the exposure of more active metal sites and enhance the mass and charge transfer, thereby deliver superb electrocatalytic performance. Nowadays, various carbon precursors with 2D morphologies have been employed for the fabrication of M-N-C catalysts. For example, graphitic carbon nitride (q-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>), a typical layered framework, can be served as sacrificial template to restrict growth of 2D carbon nanosheets.[23] Ren et al. develop a universal method using g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> nanosheets as supporting template to prepare uniformly dispersed N-coordinated metal species in porous carbon nanosheets (M–N–C PCSs). With the assembly of highly distributed N-coordinated metal species and porous nanosheet architectures, the as-synthesized Fe-N-C PCSs exhibit an outstanding electrocatalytic performance.[24] 2D Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with high surface areas and abundant active sites has also been utilized as precursor of 2D carbon materials. [25] Jiang et al. demonstrated an in-situ surface-confined strategy to encapsulate atomic Fe-N<sub>4</sub> sites into N-doped carbon nanoleaves, which exhibit excellent ORR performance. [26] Nevertheless, developing suitable carbon precursors for 2D Fe-N-C catalysts is highly desirable while still very challenging.

Polydopamine has been intensely investigated as the precursor for N doped carbon due to its excellent structural

tunability, strong chelation capability to diverse metal ions, strong adhesion on various substrates and relatively high N content.[27] Herein, tangled Fe-N-C nanosheets with ultrahigh surface area and abundant Fe-Nx active sites were prepared using a dopamine-coordination strategy. In detail, the selfpolymerization of dopamine was induced into the interface layers in layered FeCl<sub>3</sub>·6H<sub>2</sub>O crystal, [28] in which the Fe<sup>3+</sup> ion can be strongly chelated to polydopamine to form FeCl<sub>3</sub>-dopamine coordination complex, this is the precursor of Fe-N-C nanosheets. Thanks to the ultrahigh surface area, abundant Fe-Nx active sites and fantastic 2D structures, the tangled Fe-N-C nanosheets exhibit excellent ORR performance in both activity and durability, all of which surpass that of commercial Pt/C catalysts. When the tangled Fe-N-C nanosheets were evaluated as the cathode catalysts, the assembled primary Zn-air batteries (ZABs) deliver a relatively high peak power density of  $89 \text{ mW cm}^{-2}$ .

## **Results and Discussion**

A facile dopamine-coordination strategy was developed to fabricate tangled Fe–N–C nanosheets, which is schematically illustrated in Figure 1a. First, dopamine hydrochloride and FeCl<sub>3</sub>·6H<sub>2</sub>O were dissolved in water to form a homogeneous solution, which was subsequently aged and freeze-dried to generate a layered FeCl<sub>3</sub>-polydopamine coordination complex. Second, the FeCl<sub>3</sub>-polydopamine complex was carbonized at high temperature of 500–800 °C, and the relevant product was

carefully washed with 2 M HCl to remove the excess iron contained species. During the pyrolysis process, the porous carbon nanosheets was hypothetically generated via the thermal crosslinking of dopamine ligands coordinated on the  $\text{FeCl}_3 \cdot \text{6H}_2\text{O}$  layered crystals. Finally, the as-obtained intermediate product was subjected to secondary pyrolysis to achieve the targeted Fe–N–C nanosheets.

The morphology of the Fe-N-C nanosheets was characterized by SEM and TEM. The SEM images of Fe-N-C/700-pre (Figure S1) display an apparent nanosheet morphology with an interconnected structure. After secondary high-temperature calcination, the interconnected nanosheet structure in the Fe-N-C/700 nanosheets can be perfectly preserved (Figure 1b and 1c). This proves that after the two-step heating treatment plus additional acid washing, the FeCl<sub>3</sub>-polydopamine coordination complex, in which dopamine molecules were first inserted into the interlayer interstices of FeCl<sub>3</sub>·6H<sub>2</sub>O crystal and subsequent self-polymerization, was successfully converted into carbon nanosheets. However, the SEM images of nitrogen doped carbon (N-C) (Figure S2) show that without FeCl<sub>3</sub>·6H<sub>2</sub>O as a template for forming nanosheets, dopamine hydrochloride will self-polymerize into well-dispersed nanospheres in slightly alkaline conditions. The TEM image (Figure 1d and 1e) showed that the Fe-N-C/700 nanosheets are tangled together to generate a hierarchical porous structure. And the thickness of the Fe-N-C/700 nanosheets was blow 5 nm. No nanoparticles or clusters can be observed from the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image (Figure 1f), which means that Fe atoms are atomically dispersed on the N doped carbon nanosheets. And the lattice distance of Fe-N-C/700 (Figure 1g) is about ~0.34 nm, corresponding to the (002) plane of graphite carbon. [29] The selected area electron pattern (SAED) of Fe-N-C/ 700 exhibited two typical diffraction rings (inset in Figure 1g), which were associated with the (100) and (002) planes of the graphite carbon materials. [30] The energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mappings (Figure 1h) verify the highly homogeneous distribution of C, N, and Fe atoms on the Fe-N-C/700 matrix.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used to reveal the crystalline nature of the as-prepared samples (Figure 2a). Two broad peaks of Fe-N-C/700 located at ~26.2° and ~43.6°, corresponding to (002) and (100) planes of carbon materials, respectively. [31] And no additional diffraction peaks belong to iron compounds (such as oxides and carbides) were detected. Even after secondary high-temperature calcination, the crystallinity of Fe-N-C/700 is significantly lower than that of Fe-N-C/700-Pre based on the diffraction intensity of (002) plane (Figure S3a), strongly suggesting the introduction of isolated Fe atoms can disorder the lattice sequence and then reduce the crystallinity of carbon matrix.[32] To further illustrate the graphitic degree and structural defects of carbon substrate, Raman spectra were performed. The characteristics of D band at  $\sim 1338 \text{ cm}^{-1}$  and G band at ~1591 cm<sup>-1</sup> in Raman spectra represent the carbon defects sp<sup>2</sup>-hybridized and carbon respectively. [33,34] The relative intensity ratio of  $I_D/I_G$  of Fe–N–C/ 700 (Figure 2b and S3b) is higher than that of Fe-N-C/700-Pre, implying the secondary pyrolysis yields lower crystallinity and

more defects in the carbon substrate. [35] Such phenomenon was highly consistent with the above XRD results. The pore textures and surface areas of as-prepared samples were investigated by N<sub>2</sub> adsorption-desorption isotherm analysis (Figure 2c, Figure S4 and S5). As shown in Table S1, the specific surface areas of Fe-N-C/700-Pre and Fe-N-C/700 were as high as 1087.8 and 952.6 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>. The high specific surface area will undoubtedly favor the exposure of more active sites and facilitate the mass transfer in the catalytic reactions.[36-38] The pore size distribution analysis (inset in Figure 2c) showed that the micropores (centered at 0.7 nm) and a small amount of mesopores and macropores coexist in Fe-N-C/700 with a total pore volume up to 0.55 cm<sup>3</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>, proving the highly porous structures of the Fe-N-C nanosheets. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to characterize the surface chemical composition and elemental bonding configuration of the samples. Obvious peaks for C, N, and O in Fe-N-C/700 nanosheets can be detected in the XPS spectra (Figure S3c), while the signal of Fe was untraceable owing to its ultralow concentration. [39] Nevertheless, the inductively couple plasma-optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES) analysis showed that the Fe content in the Fe-N-C/ 700 was about 0.29 wt%, confirming that the presence of Fe element. In Figure 2d, the N 1s spectra of Fe-N-C/700 could be deconvoluted into five characteristic peaks, which can be well assigned to pyridinic N (398.2 eV), Fe-N (399.2 eV), pyrrolic N (400.2 eV), graphitic N (401 eV) and oxidized N (402.3 eV). [40,41] The calcination process played an important role to determine the composition of N 1s. After analyzing the relative contents of doped N in Fe-N-C/700-Pre (Figure S3d) and Fe-N-C/700, it can be found that the proportion of pyridinic N decreased, while the content of Fe-N species increased from 7.03% to 11.88% after the secondary pyrolysis, strongly indicating part of pyridinic N was converted to the Fe-N coordination (Table S2). It has been reported that the Fe-Nx species have high activity towards ORR, [42-44] thus these abundant Fe-Nx species distributed in Fe-N-C/700 nanosheets also provide a guarantee for efficient catalytic activity. Therefore, the above analyses demonstrate that atomically distributed Fe–Nx sites located on a defect-rich N-doped carbon nanosheets were obtained through a facile dopamine-coordination strategy.

To evaluate the catalytic activity and stability of the asprepared materials, the ORR properties in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte with commercial Pt/C as the benchmark catalysts were evaluated by rotating disk electrode (RDE) and rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE) technologies. The polarization curves of various prepared electrocatalysts were shown in Figure 3a. The Fe-N-C/700 catalyst exhibits a higher onset potential ( $E_{onset}$ ) of 0.99 V and a more positive half-wave potential ( $E_{1/2}$ ) of 0.88 V than Fe-N-C/500 (0.94 and 0.81 V vs. RHE, respectively), Fe-N-C/600 (0.98 and 0.87 V vs. RHE, respectively), Fe-N-C/800 (0.91 and 0.78 V vs. RHE, respectively), and even surpasses that of commercial Pt/C (0.98 and 0.84 V vs. RHE, respectively) (Figure 3b). Meanwhile, Fe-N-C/700 catalyst also possesses a higher limiting current density than the other catalysts, suggesting highly efficient oxygen intake under water immersion conditions due to the structural advantages.

The Fe–Nx active sites in Fe–N–C nanosheets should play a key role to boost the ORR activity. The LSV curve of the N–C catalyst without Fe–Nx sites is shown in Figure S6, and its half-wave potential is only 0.61 V vs. RHE. In addition, the calcination parameters on the ORR properties was investigated (Figure S7). We found that when the first pyrolysis temperature was 700 °C

and the second pyrolysis temperature was set at 900 °C, the asprepared Fe-N-C nanosheets deliver optimal ORR performance. Tafel slope of Fe-N-C/700 (Figure 3c) was determined to be  $80.7 \text{ mV dec}^{-1}$ , which was considerably lower 100.9 mV dec<sup>-1</sup> for Pt/C, indicating that the Fe-N-C/700 nanosheets manifested accelerated ORR kinetics. The LSV curves of Fe-N-C/700 with different rotation rates are shown in Figure 3d. The corresponding K–L plots (inset in Figure 3d) exhibited a perfect linearity over the potential range of 0.4-0.6 V, suggesting first-order reaction kinetics to oxygen concentration and similar electron-transfer numbers for ORR at different electrode potentials. [45-47] In addition, RRDE measurements were carried out to acquire a more accurate electron-transfer number as well as the yield of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (Figure 3e). From 0.4 to 0.8 V, the electron transfer number of Fe-N-C/700 were above 3.84 and the yield of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was below 7.9%. Therefore, all the results revealed that Fe-N-C/700 can efficiently reduce oxygen via a direct four-electron pathway. The ORR stability and tolerance to methanol of Fe-N-C/700 in comparison with Pt/C were also evaluated. The Fe-N-C/700 exhibits pronounced stability with 92.7% retention over 24 h of continuous i-t operation. In contrast, the Pt/C catalyst exhibits ~21.4% decrease in activity, indicating that the long-term stability of Pt/ C were lower than that of Fe-N-C/700 catalyst (Figure 3f). Notably, the  $E_{1/2}$  of Fe–N–C/700 was only observed with a slightly negative shift of 17 mV compared to initial ORR activities of Fe-N-C/700 after 3000 cycles (Figure S8a), demonstrating the outstanding ORR durability. Furthermore, the Fe-N-C/700 shows superior immunity to methanol crossover (Figure S8b). By adding 1 M methanol into the electrolyte during the i-t test, the current density on the Fe-N-C/700 electrode deliver a very small decay, while the current density of Pt/C shown a sharp decrease. Therefore, the as-prepared Fe-N-C nanosheets exhibit excellent ORR performance including both activity and stability. To our knowledge, the ORR performance of Fe-N-C/700 nanosheets obtained in alkaline electrolyte exceeds most of the previously reported Fe-N-C based ORR electrocatalysts (Table S3).

To further assess the performance of Fe-N-C/700 catalysts under the actual working conditions, primary ZABs were assembled (Figure 4a). [48] The Fe-N-C/700 catalyst was supported on a conductive carbon cloth to construct a breath air cathode, and commercial Pt/C based cathode was also prepared as a contrast cathode. As shown in Figure S9, the open-circuit voltage (OCV) of the Fe–N–C/700 battery was ~ 1.43 V, higher than that of Pt/C (~1.40 V). The discharge polarization and corresponding power density curves (Figure 4b) shown that the Fe-N-C/700 battery exhibited a high peak power density of 89 mW cm<sup>-2</sup>, much higher than that of Pt/C (71 mW cm<sup>-2</sup>). All the results verify Fe-N-C/700 possess a good catalytic performance in actual ZABs. Moreover, at the current density of 20 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, the Fe-N-C/700 battery exhibited a large discharge specific capacity of 801 mAhg<sup>-1</sup> after normalized to the mass of consumed Zn plate, higher than that of Pt/C  $(788 \text{ mA h g}^{-1})$  (Figure S10). The Fe–N–C/700 battery displayed a superior rate performance with the voltage retention of 99.7% at 2 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, suggesting significantly improved ORR kinetics

and electrocatalytic capability (Figure 4c). Impressively, under a constant discharge current of 5 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, a stable voltage output of ~1.3 V is maintained for over 4000 minutes without notable degradation, demonstrating the robust durability of Fe–N–C based air electrode (Figure 4d).

# **Conclusions**

In summary, we developed a dopamine-coordination strategy to synthesize iron-nitrogen co-doped carbon nanosheets as a high-performance ORR electrocatalyst. Intensive investigation disclosed that the Fe—N—C nanosheets were provided with abundant Fe—Nx species, ultrahigh surface area and unique nanosheet-tangled structure, all of which can facilitate the ORR performance. As a result, the optimized catalyst Fe—N—C/700 showed high ORR activity with  $E_{1/2}$  of 0.88 V (vs. RHE) in alkaline electrolyte, which was 40 mV higher than commercial Pt/C. At the same time, Fe—N—C/700 shows excellent stability and strong resistance to methanol cross-effects. The Fe—N—C/700 nanosheets can also be used as an air cathode catalyst for primary ZABs, showing comparable performance to Pt/C electrodes.

Nafion solution (5 wt%) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. All chemicals were used as received without any further purification.

## **Preparation of Catalysts**

In a typical procedure, 0.2 g of dopamine hydrochloride and 2 g of FeCl<sub>3</sub>·6H<sub>2</sub>O were separately dissolved in deionized water and stirred with a magnetic stirrer for 30 min. Under stirring, the aqueous solution of dopamine hydrochloride was added dropwise to the agueous solution of FeCl<sub>3</sub>·6H<sub>2</sub>O. After ageing (~12 h) and freeze-drying, the powder was immediately transferred to a tube furnace and carbonized at different temperatures  $(T_1 = 500 \,^{\circ}\text{C},$ 600 °C, 700 °C and 800 °C) for 2 h at a heating rate of 5 °C/min under a flowing nitrogen atmosphere. Next, the pyrolyzed product was leached in 2 M HCl at 80 °C for 24 h to remove inactive iron species. The leached sample was washed to neutral with water and alcohol for several times and dried in vacuum at 60°C overnight. The asobtained products were labelled as Fe-N-C/T<sub>1</sub>-Pre, where T<sub>1</sub> represents the first calcination temperature. Finally, the catalyst was carbonized for the second time in a nitrogen atmosphere with a heating rate of 10 °C/min at different temperatures (700 °C, 800 °C, 900 °C and 1000 °C) for 2 h. The as-prepared products were named as Fe–N–C/ $T_1(T_2)$ , where  $T_2$  refers to the second calcination temperature. In addition, Fe–N–C/ $T_1$ (900) was simplified as Fe–N–C/ $T_1$  in the content. Without adding FeCl<sub>3</sub>·6H<sub>2</sub>O, an N–C catalyst containing no Fe was prepared by the self-polymerization of dopamine hydrochloride in a slightly alkaline environment and the subsequent high-temperature pyrolysis.

#### **Physical Characterization**

The micromorphology of the materials was observed using through scanning electron microscope (SEM; Carl Zeiss SUPRA®55). Through transmission electron microscope (TEM; JEOL JEM-3200FS) equipped with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) to observe the microstructure and the uniform dispersion of C, N and Fe in the catalyst. Phase analysis of Fe-N-C was performed using an X-ray diffraction (XRD; PANalytical Areis). Raman spectroscopy (Raman; Renishaw in Via Qontor) was used to analyze the D and G peaks of carbon materials. The specific surface area and pore size of the material was determined by the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method and Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method on the adsorption branch, respectively (Micromeritics ASAP 2460). The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS; Thermo Fisher ESCALAB XI+) was used to analyze the electronic state of the material surface. The content of element Fe was analyzed by plasma spectrometer (ICP-OES; Agilent 7700X).

#### **Electrochemical Measurement**

All electrochemical measurements were carried out with a CHI760E electrochemical analyzer (Shanghai, Chenghua Co.) at room temperature with a standard three-electrode cell. A carbon rod (diameter 3 mm) was used as the counter electrode, a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) was used as a reference electrode and the working electrode was based on glassy carbon (GC) with a diameter of 5 mm (surface area: 0.1963 cm<sup>2</sup>). When testing ORR performance in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte solution, the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) was calculated by the equation: E(vs RHE) = E(vs SCE) +0.0591pH+0.2415 V. A well-dispersed ink composed of 5 mg Fe-N-C nanosheets, 470 μL ethanol and 30 μL 5 wt% Nafion was dropped uniformly onto the polished GC surface and dried naturally to prepare a working electrode with a catalyst loading of  $0.25~{\rm mg\,cm^{-2}}$ . Before testing,  ${\rm O_2}$  was bubbled through the electrolyte for at least 30 min to assure oxygen saturation, and then the ORR catalytic performance was measured under a continuous supply of oxygen. The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curve was tested at a scanning speed of 5 mV s<sup>-1</sup> to evaluate the catalyst performance. Additionally, the 20 wt% Pt/C catalyst was also prepared and dropped with a loading amount of 0.2 mg cm<sup>-2</sup> for a comparison. The methanol tolerance of the target catalyst was judged by observing the current change during the chronoamperometry (i-t) process after adding a certain amount (3 ml) of methanol.

The electron transfers number (n) was calculated from the Koutecky-Levich equation [Eqs. (1) and (2)]:

$$J^{-1} = J_{K}^{-1} + \left(B\omega^{1/2}\right)^{-1} \tag{1}$$

$$B = 0.62nF(D_0)^{2/3}v^{-1/6}C_0 \tag{2}$$

Among them, J is the measured current density,  $J_k$  is the kinetic current density, and  $\omega$  is the electrode rotating rate. B is the slope of the K-L curve, n is the number of electron transfers, F is the Faraday constant (96485 Cmol<sup>-1</sup>),  $D_0$  is the diffusion coefficient of oxygen (1.9×10<sup>-5</sup> cm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>),  $\nu$  is the kinematic viscosity (0.01 cm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>), and  $C_0$  is the concentration of oxygen (1.2×10<sup>-6</sup> mol cm<sup>-3</sup>) in 0.1 M KOH solution.

The transfer number (n) and hydrogen peroxide yield ( $H_2O_2\%$ ) were calculated based on the RRDE measurements by the followed equations [Eqs. (3) and (4)]:

$$n = \frac{4I_D}{I_D + \frac{I_R}{N}} \tag{3}$$

$$H_2O_2\% = 200^* \frac{I_{R/N}}{I_D + I_{R/N}} \tag{4}$$

Among them,  $I_D$  is the disk current,  $I_R$  is the ring current, and N is current collection efficiency of the Pt ring (N=0.37). The signal on ring electrode is collected at 0.5 V (vs. SCE).

#### Assembly of a Primary Zn-Air Battery

The Zinc-air batteries were assembled by using electrocatalystcoated hydrophobic carbon cloth (1.5 mg cm<sup>-1</sup>) as air cathode, polished Zn foil as anode, and the mixture of 0.2 M zinc acetate (Zn(AC)<sub>2</sub>) and 6 M KOH as electrolyte. The discharge polarization curve of the battery was measured on the electrochemical workstation (CHI 760E). The galvanostatic test was performed using the battery test system (Land 2001A) at room temperature.

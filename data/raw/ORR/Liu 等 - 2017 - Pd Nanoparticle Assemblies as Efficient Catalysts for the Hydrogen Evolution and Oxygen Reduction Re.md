**Abstract:** Developing bifunctional catalysts for both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is crucial for obtaining hydrogen easily by water splitting to promote electrochemical energy conversion in fuel cells. In this paper, we report a facile approach for the synthesis of Pd nanoparticle assemblies (NPAs) with porous structure as catalysts for both the HER and the ORR with desirable electrocatalytic activities and long-term stability. For the HER, the porous Pd NPAs exhibit a low onset potential, a small Tafel slope of 30 mV dec–1, and an exceptionally low overpotential of about 80 mV at a current density of 100 mA cm–2, and these porous Pd NPAs maintain their catalytic activity for at least 1000 cyclic voltammetry (CV) cycles of durability in 0.5 M H2SO4. As for the ORR, the porous Pd NPAs offer a remarkable catalytic activity with a diffusion-limiting current density of 3.85 mA cm–2, a halfpotential of 0.837 V, and an onset potential of 0.926 V at 1600 rpm with a scan rate of 5 mV s–1. This study enables the design of novel bifunctional electrocatalysts in the renewable energy field.

## **Introduction**

Development of renewable and green energy sources has been attracting extensive research interest lately.[1–3] Of these methodologies, the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) has been found to play a key role in fuel cells and Zinc Air batteries, while the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is important in the production of clean and sustainable energy. Hence, the development of highly efficient electrocatalysts for both the ORR and HER is urgently needed.[2,3] It is well known that Pt and its alloys, exhibiting low overpotential and small Tafel slope, are among the best HER and ORR electrocatalysts.[3] However, these Pt-based catalysts suffer from some disadvantages, such as high cost and low durability.[3–5] Consequently, it is important to develop effective HER and ORR electrocatalysts with low cost and high stability.

It is well known that Pd nanoparticles (NPs) have low cost and an atomic size similar to that of Pt, corresponding to a lattice mismatch of only 0.77 %.[6,7] Three-dimensional (3D) Pd NPs, which have a larger surface-area-to-volume ratio and more active centers, have been a popular choice of catalyst for applications such as organic synthesis, fuel cells, electrochemical detection, and hydrogen storage/sensing.[8–11] For example, porous Pd nanoflowers have higher electrocatalytic activity and better stability for the electro-oxidation of ethanol than Pd NPs.[12] In spite of the superiority of 3D Pd NP catalysts in the electro-oxidation of methanol or formic acid, there is still no

In the past decade, hollow or porous 3D NPs with sizes of less than 100 nm have shown great potential in diverse applications such as catalysis, sensing, energy storage, and biomedicine.[13–16] Numerous approaches have been developed to prepare hollow or porous 3D NPs by using the Kirkendall effect, galvanic replacement, chemical etching, template synthesis, Ostwald ripening, and other methods.[16–18] Most of these methods involve the use of a strong reducing agent, or a toxic organic reagent, or high temperature. Reagents such as sodium borohydride, hydrazine hydrate, or organic amine reducing agents mediate the reaction, capping agents or coordinating ligands direct the growth, and templates control the morphology.[13,15,19–21] As a consequence, for the sustainable production of catalysts, the green synthesis approach, including a facile green chemical reduction strategy, is highly desirable.

In this work, we demonstrate a facile and green method for the synthesis of porous Pd NPAs as a novel electrochemical catalyst with excellent electrocatalytic performance for both the HER and the ORR. The as-prepared porous Pd NPAs exhibit excellent catalytic efficiency in the HER with a small Tafel slope of about 30 mV dec–1 and an exceptionally low overpotential of about 80 mV at a current density of 100 mA cm–2 in 0.5 <sup>M</sup> H2SO4. Moreover, they retain their catalytic activity for at least 1000 cyclic voltammetry (CV) cycles in acidic media; this performance is better than that of most other non-noble-metal catalysts and approaches that of a commercial Pt/C catalyst. At the same time, the as-prepared porous Pd NPAs also present remarkable electrocatalytic properties for the ORR with a halfpotential of 0.837 V and an onset potential of 0.926 V at 1600 rpm with a scan rate of 5 mV s–1 in 0.1 <sup>M</sup> KOH.

### **Results and Discussion**

Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis (Figure 1A) shows that the sample is composed of Pd, C, and Si. The observed C and Si may come from the adsorbed organic ligands or the carbon film on the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) grid. Figure 1B shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the Pd NPAs prepared under the typical reaction conditions. The diffraction peaks in the range 30° < 2*θ* < 90° can be indexed to the (111), (200), (220), (311), and (222) planes of fccphase Pd, and the lattice parameter is a = 3.89 Å, all of which are in good accordance with the ASTM standard 65–2867.

TEM and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images of the Pd NPAs are shown in Figures 2A and 2B, respectively. Figure 2A shows that the sample consists of porous NPAs. The average diameter is approximately 50 nm. Furthermore, the TEM image in Figure 2B shows that the porous Pd NPAs are composed of three-dimensionally connected ellipsoid-like Pd nanoparticles with an average diameter of 5.5 nm. Moreover, some of the nanoellipsoid units are fused together to produce nanocavities or pore-like structures, which increases the specific surface area of NPs and is thus beneficial for their electrocatalytic performance.[22–24] The HRTEM analysis of the nanoellipsoid building block (Figure 2C) gives clear lattice fringes, and the lattice spacing is about 2.30 Å, corresponding to the interplanar separation between (111) lattice planes of the fcc-phase Pd. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area of

the porous Pd NPAs calculated from the N2 sorption isotherms is 53 cm<sup>2</sup> g–1 (Figure 2D). The Pd NPAs have a microporous structure, with pore sizes mainly in the range of 3 to 3.5 nm (inset of Figure 2D).

In the present strategy used, cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) plays an important role in the formation of the porous Pd NPAs. In the absence of CPC, the reaction leads to the formation of polyhedral Pd nanostructures, which indicates that cationic quaternary ammonium compounds are beneficial for the formation of the porous structure (Figure 3A). When the concentration of CPC was greater than 0.8 mM, the Pd NPs could be effectively self-assembled because of the sufficient amount of surfactant molecules, leading to the formation of the porous Pd nanostructure (Figures 3B and 3C). Note that, when the concentration of CPC was increased to 42 mM, polyhedral Pd nanostructures with smaller diameters (10 nm) were obtained (Figure 3D). From these experimental results, we can conclude that the optimal concentration range of CPC for synthesizing porous Pd NPAs is from 0.8 mM to about 21 mM, which is consistent with previous reports.[25–27]

The electrochemical HER of the porous Pd NPAs prepared was studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV) in N2-saturated 0.5 M H2SO4 solutions with a typical three-electrode setup at room temperature. The catalyst loading was 0.28 mg cm–2 for all HER experiments. The polarization curves displayed in Figures 4A, S1, and S2 show that the porous Pd NPAs demonstrate a small onset potential, approaching that of 20 % Pt/C, and a significantly low overpotential of about 80 mV at a current density of 100 mA cm–2. This low overpotential for such a high current density compares favorably with most of the reported values for non-Pt metal HER catalysts in acidic media at the same catalyst loading (Table S1). The Tafel slope is an intrinsic property of the catalyst that is determined by the rate-controlling step

of the HER.[28] For the whole HER process, the HER kinetics of the above-mentioned catalysts was further evaluated from the corresponding Tafel plots. From the *η* versus log j plots (Figure 4B), Tafel slopes of about 30 mV dec–1 were calculated for 20 % Pt/C and the porous Pd NPAs. Typically, there are three possible reaction steps considered for the HER in acidic media: the Volmer, Heyrovsky, and Tafel reactions.[28,29] Thus, the measured Tafel slope for the porous Pd NPAs suggests a Volmer– Tafel mechanism that has an effect on this catalytic reaction, where the electrochemical desorption is the rate-limiting step. The exchange current density (jo) is another important parameter that reflects the intrinsic activity of a specific HER catalyst, which can be calculated from the corresponding Tafel plot.[30] Remarkably, the j<sup>o</sup> of porous Pd NPAs (0.24 mA cm–2) is higher than that of the 20 % Pt/C (0.21 mA cm–2) catalyst.

(D) Chronoamperometric curve of the porous Pd NPAs at a constant overpotential of 180 mV.

Durability is another significant criterion to evaluate an advanced electrocatalyst. Figure 4C shows the stability curve for the porous Pd NPAs used as catalyst. The j–E plot for the porous Pd NPAs obtained after 1000 continuous cycles is only slightly different from the initial plot. In addition, the chronoamperometric curve in Figure 4D further illustrates that the current density of the complete HER process is maintained at a constant overpotential of 180 mV without any obvious change even after 25000 s, suggesting the superior stability of the asprepared porous Pd NPAs. It is worth noting that the electrocatalytic performance of the porous Pd NPAs for the HER is better than that of most other non-Pt electrocatalysts and is very close to that of the commercial Pt/C catalyst at the same mass loading (Table S1).

To estimate the differences in the electrochemically active surface area of the porous Pd NPAs, the CV method was employed to measure the electrochemical double-layer capacitance (EDLC), Cdl, as shown in Figure S3.[2] The Cdl value of porous Pd NPAs is 43 mF cm–2, which reveals that the porous Pd NPAs present the highest intrinsic HER catalytic performance. Moreover, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was applied to study the electrode kinetics of the catalysts. The Nyquist plots in Figure S4 attest to a remarkable change in the charge-transfer resistance (Rct) at different overpotentials, which is highly consistent with the polarization curves of the porous Pd NPAs in Figure 4A.

The amount of hydrogen produced through electrochemical water splitting was measured quantitatively by using gas chromatography (GC). The Faradaic efficiency (FE) of the HER can be obtained by dividing the experimentally measured amount of hydrogen by the calculated value (assuming 100 % FE).[31] The excellent agreement of the two sets of values (Figure S5) indicates that the FE is close to 100 %.

Moreover, the electrocatalytic ORR performance of the porous Pd NPAs was investigated by using a rotating-disk electrode (RDE) in O2 vs. N2-saturated 0.1 <sup>M</sup> KOH.[2] Figure 5A shows polarization curves recorded at different rotating speeds from 400 to 2500 rpm, which were used to obtain the Koutecky– Levich plots presented in the inset of Figure 5A. From the slopes of the Koutecky–Levich plots, the electron transfer number (n) involved in the ORR process for these catalysts is calculated to be about 4 at 0.5 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), indicating that the ORR mechanism for those catalysts follows the direct "4e– " pathway (O2 + 2H2O + 4e– → 4OH– ).[3] To assess the electrocatalytic activity of the porous Pd NPAs, RDE measurements were also carried out on the porous Pd NPAs in O2-

saturated 0.1 M KOH at a rotation rate of 1600 rpm, indicating a diffusion-limiting current density reaching 3.85 mA cm–2, a half-potential of 0.837 V, and an onset potential of 0.926 V with a scan rate of 5 mV s–1 (Figure 5B). Meanwhile, the mass activity of the porous Pd NPAs at 0.85 V was calculated to be 0.2 A mg–1 (Figure S6). All these values are close to those of the commercial Pt/C. These results reveal that the porous Pd NPAs possess a higher catalytic performance than that of the control catalysts (Figure S7). Additionally, long-term stability or durability is another important parameter that determines the practical application of a specific ORR electrocatalyst.[32] Figure 5C illustrates that the as-prepared porous Pd NPAs exhibit a superior stability for the ORR in 0.1 M KOH with a negligible degradation even after a long time span of 1000 continuous cycles. The TEM image in Figure 5D indicates that there is no obvious shape change for the porous Pd NPAs used as catalyst after the stability test.

On the basis of the above results and in conjunction with recent reports of porous nanostructures,[12,14,15] the remarkable bifunctional properties of porous Pd NPAs might be ascribed to the following factors: the presence of porous NPAs ensures higher specific surface area and enables the utilization of a maximum number of atoms in the catalytic process. It can effectively tune the adsorption energy of atomic hydrogen or oxygen adsorbed to the catalyst and reaches an optimal equilibrium state that improves the ORR and HER performances.

#### **Conclusions**

In summary, we have successfully prepared porous Pd NPAs via a facile synthetic strategy. The as-prepared porous Pd NPAs act as excellent dual electrocatalysts for both the HER and the ORR, with high electrocatalytic activity and superior stability. For the HER, the porous Pd NPAs exhibit a low onset overpotential, a small Tafel slope (30 mV dec–1), and a low overpotential of about 80 mV at a current density of 100 mA cm–2 and maintain their catalytic activity for at least 1000 CV cycles of durability in 0.5 M H2SO4. For the ORR, the porous Pd NPAs offer a remarkable catalytic activity with a half-potential of 0.837 V and an onset potential of 0.926 V at 1600 rpm, with a scan rate of 5 mV s–1, and good stability in 0.1 <sup>M</sup> KOH. This study opens up new avenues for the design of novel bifunctional electrocatalysts for use in the renewable energy technology field.

#### **Experimental Section**

**Synthesis of the Porous Pd NPAs:** In a typical synthesis, Na2PdCl4 (0.05 M, ca. 1 mL) and CPC (0.038 g, 0.1 mmol) were dissolved in deionized water (5 mL). Then the reactor was heated to 70 °C and maintained at this temperature for 10 min. An ascorbic acid solution obtained by dissolving ascorbic acid (0.74 g; ca. 0.42 mmol) in deionized water (ca. 20 mL) was injected into the reaction system and maintained at that temperature for 30 min. Then, the reactor was naturally cooled to 30 °C. A large amount of precipitate was produced, which was separated by centrifugation and washed with deionized water and ethanol 2–3 times to remove the byproducts. Finally, the precipitate was dried under ambient conditions for further use.

**Electrochemical ORR Measurements:** Electrochemical measurements of ORR activity were performed with an electrochemical workstation (CHI 700E) in a 0.1 M KOH aqueous solution. A Gamry's rotating disk electrode (RDE) was the working electrode, and a Ag/ AgCl electrode (3 M KCl) and a platinum foil were used as the reference and counter electrode, respectively. The catalyst dispersions were prepared by mixing a certain amount of catalyst with the appropriate amount of water. The catalyst suspension (20 μL) was dropped onto the RDE surface and air-dried. Then, a 1 % Nafion solution (5 μL) was spread on the surface of the catalyst layer and allowed to dry. The sample was cycled multiple times to remove surface contamination and ensure steady state conditions. In all measurements, the Ag/AgCl reference electrode was calibrated with respect to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). ERHE = EAg/AgCl + 0.964 V.

**Electrochemical HER Measurements:** The HER measurements were also performed with the electrochemical workstation (CHI, 660E) in a 0.5 M H2SO4 aqueous solution. The catalyst suspension (10 μL) was dropped onto the glassy carbon (or carbon cloth) electrode surface and air-dried. The polarization curves were obtained by sweeping the potential from –0.5 to 0.1 V at a scan rate of 5 mV s–1. In 0.5 <sup>M</sup> H2SO4, ERHE = EAg/AgCl + 0.209 V.

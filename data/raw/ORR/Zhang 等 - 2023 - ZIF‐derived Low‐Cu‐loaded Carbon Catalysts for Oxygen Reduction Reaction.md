Cu N C catalysts with nitrogen-coordinated copper supported on carbon exhibits good catalytic performance in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and is considered as an excellent substitute for Pt catalyst. Achieving high electrocatalytic activity with low amount of copper is critical for improving the performance and reducing the cost of fuel cells. Here, we propose a Cu NC-8 catalyst, using zeolitic-imidazolate-framework (ZIF), which is rich in N-coordination, as the precursor. High -emperature pyrolysis of the ZIF-8 provides metal anchored sites in the carbon skeleton, which promotes the construction of Cu N active centers by the introduced Cu. The N-coordination also adjust the electron density of the C atoms to promote the adsorption of O2 on the catalyst, which is beneficial to the ORR activity of 4e pathway. The 2.5% Cu NC-8 electrocatalyst shows high efficiency ORR activity (*E*onset=1.0 V and *E*1/2=0.82 V) and good stability.

# **Introduction**

As an electrochemical device that can directly converts chemical energy into electrical energy, fuel cell not only has high conversion efficiency, but also has no pollution effect on the environment.[1] The keys to converting chemical energy into electrical energy are that the oxidation reaction at the anode and the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at the cathode.[2] Due to the strong O=O bond (498 kJmol <sup>1</sup> ),[3] the kinetics of oxygen reduction is slow, which results in a larger overpotential and even requiring nearly ten times the catalyst loading for the cathode than that of anode.[4] Currently, Pt-group metals are commonly used to break the activation barriers. However, the limited reserves and high price of Pt-group metals have severely hindered the development of commercial applications.[5] In this context, researchers have been committed to designing and synthesizing non-noble metal electrocatalysts, like conducting polymers,[6] transition metal catalysts,[7] metals alloys,[8] and heteroatoms-doped carbon materials.[9] Among these catalysts, transition metals and nitrogen codoped carbon materials (M N C) often exhibit outstanding ORR catalytic performance. Nitrogen-doped carbon materials show excellent activity,[10] because N-doping changes the spin density and charge distribution of adjacent carbon atoms,[11] which constructs the active sites in the carbon skeleton.[12] In addition, N atoms can anchor metal atoms via strong chemical bonds, resulting in uniform dispersion of metals in N-doped carbon materials and preventing metal agglomeration.[13] Some studies show that the ORR performance of M N C catalysts can be further improved by adjusting its composition or structural characteristics to endow catalysts with high intrinsic activity,[14] sufficient active sites, and fast transport routes for ORR related species.

Zeolite imidazolate framework (ZIFs) owns the sodalite (SOD) topology, which is constituted by transition metal ions with imidazolate (IM) type organic linkers.[15] It simultaneously provides the metal, nitrogen, and carbon elements. Porous carbon materials with high specific surface area and rich N coordination can be obtained by calcining ZIFs.[16] Therefore, ZIFs have been widely studied as the precursors for M N C catalysts.[17] Moreover, the structures of ZIFs are determined by the metal ions, organic ligands, and different solution environments.[18] In 3D ZIFs (such as ZIF-8 and ZIF-67), rhombic dodecahedron structures are bridged by the deprotonated imidazole linkers. Whereas, bridging the imidazolate molecules through hydrogen bond forms 2D ZIFs (such as ZIF L).[19] Therefore, according to flexible control features of ZIFs, it is possible to prepare the M N C catalysts with various structure.

ZIF-8 is a type of ZIFs with Zinc (Zn) as the node. The boiling point of Zn is 907°C, so the volatilization of Zn during high temperature calcination leaves metal vacancies.[20] The metal vacancies provide the anchor position for active metal atoms and prevents the metal agglomeration. The M N C catalysts prepared by ZIF-8 decorated with transition metals (such as iron, cobalt, copper) showed excellent catalytic activity. Chen et al.[21] prepared porous Cu N/C catalysts by pyrolyzing Cudoped zeolitic-imidazolate-framework-8 (Cu-ZIF-8) in an inert atmosphere. The derived Cu N/C polyhedral catalyst produces the Cu(II) N dipolar bond as the active center in the carbon matrix, and the catalyst shows excellent ORR activity and better stability compared with commercial 30 wt.% Pt/C catalyst. Xie et al.[22] prepared a Cu N/C catalyst by pyrolyzing Cu-adsorbed imidazole framework molecular sieve (Cu@ZIF-8) at high temperature. The catalyst showed high ORR activity in alkaline

system, good methanol resistance, and long-term stability, which is attributed to the strong synergistic effect between Cu(II) N ligand and Cu(0) nanoparticles, sufficient active sites, and rapid mass transfer. Compared with widely investigated Fe and Co transition metal catalysts, copper owns more suitable adsorption energy of oxygen for ORR, leading to higher ORR activity in theory.[23] In addition, Cu has excellent electrical conductivity (only lower than Ag). Fenton reaction is avoided by Cu, which is normally occurred with Fe and Co and destroys the active center of M N C catalysts.[10a,24] The above unique characteristics conduce to promote the electrocatalytic activity of ORR.

In this paper, the Cu NC-8 electrocatalyst was prepared by pyrolysis of Cu-ZIF-8, of which the Cu ions were absorbed in ZIF-8. For comparison, the Cu NC L catalyst with 2D structure was prepared in a polar aqueous solution. The structure-activity relationship of the two structural catalysts was explored. The ORR activity of Cu NC-8 electrocatalyst in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte shows excellent catalytic activity (like the lower overpotential and high half-wave potential), long cycle stability, and low yield of H2O2 in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte.

# **Results and Discussion**

As shown in the catalyst preparation process of the Scheme 1, Cu NC-8 electrocatalyst with rhombic dodecahedron morphology was prepared by pyrolysis Cu-ZIF-8, of which the ZIF-8 was

first prepared following by the adsorption of Cu<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> ions. The Cu NC L catalyst with 2D structure was prepared by calcinating Cu-ZIF L, which was synthesized in a polar aqueous solution with adding both Cu(NO3)2 and Zn(NO3)3 simultaneously.

The original morphology of ZIF-8, Cu-ZIF-8, and Cu-ZIF L precursors and the morphology change after calcination are characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Figure 1(a) presents the TEM images of the pristine ZIF-8. The ZIF-8 crystallites with the rhombic dodecahedra are around 50 nm. Figure 1(b) shows that the Cu-ZIF-8 preserves the morphology and the particle size is basically the same as that of ZIF-8. It means that the morphology and the structure of ZIF-8 are not changed by the introduction of Cu2<sup>+</sup> ions. From Figure 1(c), it can be observed that Cu-ZIF L shows a two-dimensional leaflike structure with a length of ~50 nm and a diameter of ~25 nm. A large number of nanoparticles with a diameter of ~5 nm are loading on Cu-ZIF L. After the calcination, the shape of the Zn NC and Cu NC-8 was collapses after high temperature pyrolysis (Figure 1(d) and (e)). They loss the original rhombic dodecahedron structure, and the particles are aggregated, which is because of the volatilization of Zn atoms during calcination at 900°C.[29] Meanwhile, a small number of dispersed metal particles can be observed in Cu NC-8. The highresolution TEM image of Cu NC-8 (Figure S1) shows the lattice fringes corresponding to Cu (200) planes with a lattice spacing of 0.180 nm. However, the agglomeration of Zn NC is obviously more serious than that of Cu NC-8. It is speculated that when the Zn atoms volatilize, the Cu in Cu NC-8 replaces the vacancy of Zn, so the original morphology is remained to a large extent. Due to high-temperature pyrolysis, the morphology of Cu NC L is also completely changed from Cu-ZIF L (Figure 1(f)).

The crystal structure of Zn NC, Cu NC-8, and Cu NC L electrocatalysts, as well as the ZIF-8, Cu-ZIF-8, and Cu-ZIF L precursors were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD). The results are shown in Figure 2. As can be seen in Figure 2(a), ZIF-8 and Cu-ZIF-8 observed diffraction peaks clearly at 2*θ*=7.3°, 10.4°, and 12.7°, ect., corresponding to (011), (002), and (112) crystal planes of ZIF-8 reported.[25] And the peak intensities of ZIF-8 and Cu-ZIF-8 are also similar, indicating that the introduction of Cu<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> also did not change the crystal lattice structure. In Figure 2(b), it can be observed that the characteristic peaks of Cu-ZIF L at 2*θ*=12.79°, 21.55°, 25.71°, 32.05°, 33.42°, 36.37°, 43.44°, 52.82°, and 58.04° corresponding to (001), (110), (002), (200), (120), (121), (122), (320), and (004) crystal planes of Cu2(NO3)(OH)3 (PDF # 45–0594), suggesting the prepared Cu-ZIF L contains Cu2(NO3)(OH)3 crystals. The XRD spectra of Zn NC, Cu NC-8, and Cu NC L are shown in Figure 2(c). As for Zn NC and Cu NC-8, there is a broad diffraction peak of the graphitic carbon (002) plane at 2*θ*=25.4°, which demonstrated the carbon with partially graphitized formed by the calcination of ZIF-8 and Cu-ZIF-8 at 900°C.[26] The peaks observed at 2*θ*= 43.2°, 50.4°, and 74.1° for the Cu NC-8 corresponding to the (111), (200) and (220) planes of metallic Cu (PDF #04-0836). It is revealed that ZIF-8 mainly forms graphitized carbon carrier by pyrolysis at 900°C, while the crystal structure of elemental Cu is

clearly observed in the sample after pyrolysis of Cu-ZIF-8 at 900°C. The formation of metallic Cu is due to the reduction of Cu<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> ions by nearby C atoms at high temperature.[15] The characteristic diffraction peaks belonging to CuO and Cu2+1O are observed in the Cu NC L material, indicating that it contained copper oxide crystals.

In order to further compare the graphitization degree of Zn NC, Cu NC-8, and Cu NC L, Raman spectra were employed. As shown in the Figure 2(d), two dominant peaks at about 1340 cm <sup>1</sup> and 1580 cm <sup>1</sup> corresponding to the D and G bands of the carbon material, respectively, are detected.[27] The D bands are attributed to the sp3 bond defects in the carbon matrix, and the G bands are related to the in-plane stretching of the carbon atom sp2 hybridize.[28] The intensity ratio (ID/IG) of D and G bands reveal the degree of defects in carbon materials, and the smaller the value of ID/IG, the higher the degree of graphitization of the carbon materials.[11] It can be seen that the ID/IG value of Zn NC (ID/IG=1.106) is the smallest, indicating a higher degree of graphitization of it. The higher value of ID/IG for Cu NC-8 (1.128) and Cu NC L (1.490) than Zn NC (1.106) indicates the formation of more defects with the addition of Cu atoms. Moreover, a higher degree of graphitization is detected for Cu NC-8. Generally, the higher degree of graphitization of the carbon carriers, the better conductivity of the catalyst, which is more beneficial to accelerate ORR electron transfer.

To analyze the surface composition and electronic structure of catalysts, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) of Zn NC, Cu NC-8, and Cu NC L were carried out. The XPS survey results (Figure S2 (a)) reveal the coexistence of C, N, O, and Zn elements in the Zn NC, Cu NC-8 and Cu NC L catalysts. It proves that although Zn atoms in ZIF-8 volatilize in the pyrolysis process, part of Zn atoms are still left as metal center of MOF material. Figure S2 (b) is the C 1s high-resolution XPS of Zn NC, Cu NC-8, and Cu NC L. The C 1s of Zn NC and Cu NC-8 are divided into six peaks, including C C, C N, C O, C=N, C=O, and PI=PI\*, while Cu NC L is divided into three peaks, including C C, C N, and C O. All the above three catalysts own C N, which confirms that the N atom provided by 2-methylimidazole is successfully doped into the carbon skeleton. N atoms can adjust the electron cloud density of their adjacent C atoms, improve the ability to capture O2, and promote oxygen reduction reactions.[29] At the same time, N atoms can also be used to anchor Cu atoms.

The valence state of each element and the bonding of each atom in the catalyst were analyzed by XPS high-resolution spectra. High-resolution N 1s XPS spectra of the Zn NC and Cu NC-8 catalysts (Figure 3(a)) provide the bonding status of N, which are deconvoluted into five peaks, including pyridinic-N (398.5 eV), metal-N (M N) (399.7 eV), pyrrolic-N (400.7 eV), graphitic-N (401.6 eV), and oxidized-N (403.3 eV).[30] However, pyridinic-N (398.9 eV), M N (399.7 eV), pyrrolic-N (400.7 eV), and graphite-N (401.4 eV) are observed in the N 1s spectra of Cu NC L. The content of nitrogen species are shown in Figure 3(b), and the specific percentage is listed in Table 1. First of all, M N bonds is generally considered to be the active sites for oxygen reduction reaction in M N C catalysts.[31] It can be seen from the Table 1 that content of M N in Cu NC-8 catalyst (1.74 at.%) is higher than that of Zn NC (1.35 at.%). The increased M N content in the Cu NC-8 can certify to the formation of Cu N bond in the Cu NC-8 catalyst. Moreover, the atomic content of Zn in Cu NC-8 is only 0.7 at.%, which is less than that of Zn NC. Therefore, the M N in Cu NC-8 is more attributed to the Cu N catalyst. The content of N atoms (23.87 at.%) and Zn atoms (1.99 at.%) in Cu NC L catalyst was significantly higher than that of Cu NC-8. However, according to XRD, it was speculated that the catalyst M N was mainly attributed to Zn N. And the binding energy of pyridinic-N of Cu NC L is significantly higher compared to Cu NC-8, which indicates that less electrons transfer from C to N, which will weaken the bond strength between N atoms and metals.[32]

1044.8 eV are assigned to Zn<sup>0</sup> 2p3/2 and Zn<sup>0</sup> 2p1/2, respectively. The two peaks at 1024.1 eV and 1047.1 eV are assigned to Zn<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> 2p3/2 and Zn<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> 2p1/2, respectively (Figure 3(d)). It can be seen from the peak intensity that in the above three catalysts, Zn mainly exists in the state of metallic Zn. A very small amount of Zn<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> exist. The high-resolution Cu 2p spectra of Cu NC-8 and Cu NC L shown in Figure 3(c). The content of Cu atoms in the two catalysts is 0.37 at% (Cu NC-8) and 1.6 at% (Cu NC L). The trend of Cu content in both catalysts is consistent with ICP test results (Table S1). The ICP can more accurately test the bulk metal content in the whole catalyst. Table S1 shows that there is a small amount of metal Zn residue in Zn NC, Cu NC-8, and Cu NC L. However, compared with Zn NC, the content of Zn in Cu NC-8 and Cu NC L decreased significantly, which indicate that the introduction of Cu contributed to the volatilization of various Zn in the preparation process, and more metal vacancies could be used to anchor Cu atoms and form more Cu N structures. The results of ICP shows that the Cu content of Cu NC-8 and Cu NC L catalysts are 7.93% and 13.15%, respectively, which are much higher than that in the XPS results. Because the XPS is used to investigate the surface of materials, which can provide quantitative information on the chemical composition within the top ~10 nm depth of the surface. Most remarkably, in the interior of the structure or the metal are covered by a thicker carbon layer. The O2 cannot be diffused to the metal surface, so they are not effective catalytic active centers. The general measurement range of XPS is about 10 nm below the surface of the sample, and reaction is mainly taking place on the surface, so it is effective to compare the contents and oxidation state of the catalyst by XPS. Cu atoms are deeply buried in the Cu NC-8 catalyst is not easily detected. Cu<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> 2p3/2 (934.4 eV) and Cu0 2p3/2 (932.2 eV) are deconvoluted for Cu NC-8. The existence of Cu0 is due to the reduction of Cu<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> ions by nearby carbon atoms during the pyrolysis process at high temperature. However, Cu 2p3/2 spectrum of Cu NC L was deconvoluted into Cu2<sup>+</sup> 2p3/2 (935.3 eV) and Cu<sup>+</sup> 2p3/2 (933.3 eV). The obvious satellite peak at 942.8 eV also proves the existence of Cu2<sup>+</sup>. It shows that in Cu NC L, Cu exists mainly in the ionic state.

The electrocatalytic activity of Zn NC, Cu NC-8, and Cu NC L catalysts towards ORR has been carried out in 0.1 M KOH solution with a typical three-electrode system shown in Figure 4. A comparison of the N2-saturated and O2-saturated CV curves (Figure 4(a)) reveals catalytic activities of these three catalysts towards ORR by the appeared reduction peak. Moreover, the Cu NC-8 (red line) showed a positive reduction peak

compared with other two catalysts. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) at the scanning rate of 10 mV s <sup>1</sup> and a rotating speed of 1600 rpm was utilized to further evaluate the ORR activity of them (Figure 4(b)). It can be observed from the LSV curve that the result of Cu NC L are very similar to Zn NC, indicating that most of the M N complexes in Cu NC L are Zn N bonds. Compared to the other two catalysts, the Cu NC-8 exhibits excellent performance towards ORR, as shown in the Figure 4(c), which is fully demonstrated by the highest *E*1/2 (0.81 V vs RHE) and the *E*onset of (0.93 V vs RHE). One of the most important intermediates of ORR is H2O2 produced in the 2e pathway. Therefore, H2O2% is one of the important indicators to appraise the efficiency performance of the 4e pathway of electrocatalysts. The H2O2% and electron transfer numbers were gained by the rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) technique for Zn NC, Cu NC-8, and Cu NC L, of which the electron transfer numbers are 3.34, 3.76, and 3.33, respectively. The ORR mechanism of these prepared samples are mainly 4e pathway, but some O2 of Zn NC and Cu NC L are reduced via the 2e pathway. As shown in Figure 4(d), in the potential range of 0.2 V to 0.8 V, the H2O2% of Cu NC-8 is about 12.04%, which is much lower than those of Zn NC (32.70%) and Cu NC L (33.6%). Taken together, Cu NC-8 catalyzes the ORR to H2O with higher efficiency and better catalytic activity. The active

sites in the catalysts were investigated by the SCN- deactivated experiments (Figure 5) With the addition of SCN- , *E*1/2 of Zn NC, Cu NC-8, and Cu NC L displayed decrease from 0.71 V to 0.64 V, 0.81 V to 0.79 V, and 0.69 V to 0.62 V, respectively. Cu NC-8 displayed tolerance to SCN- with slightly decrease of *E*1/2 (20 mV). Thus, N-doped carbons and Cu N nanoparticles embedded in the carbon contributed to the major roles of Cu NC-8 in the ORR. However, the *E*1/2 of Cu NC L and Zn N decayed obviously, which further proves that M N in Cu NC L is mainly attributed to Zn N structure.

To investigate the different conductive behaviors of Cu NC-8, Cu NC L and Zn NC, electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were measured at open circuit potential (OCP) to study the mass and electron transport of the catalysts. As shown in Figure S3, the semicircle in the high frequency region is associated with the internal resistance, while the low-frequency semicircle is related to the charge transfer resistance (Rct). The Rct of Cu NC-8 is 20.64 Ω, which is lower than that of Cu NC L (25.41 Ω ) and Zn NC (40.35 Ω), suggesting a higher conductivity. The fast mass and electron transport of Cu NC-8 are attributed its high graphitization degree.

Comparing to Zn NC and Cu NC L, the M N in Cu NC-8 catalysts is mainly Cu N with higher catalytic activity, while the M N in Zn NC and Cu NC L are Zn N bonds. In addition, it can be realized from analysis of Raman that Cu NC-8 catalysts have a higher degree of graphitization, which makes the catalyst have faster ORR electron transfer efficiency. Therefore,

line) and without (solid line) 0.01 M KSCN in the electrolytes for the ORR.

the Cu NC-8, which is originated from ZIF-8, owns more suitable structure. The amount of Cu atoms is further investigated.

The morphology of the as-prepared Cu NC-8 electrocatalysts with the various Cu2<sup>+</sup> additions were characterized by TEM (Figure S4). It can be seen from the Figure S4 (a) and S4 (b) that 2.5% Cu-ZIF-8 and 10% Cu-ZIF-8 are very similar in morphology and the particle size, and most of the nanoparticles are rhombic dodecahedron with a particle size of about 60 nm, which is consistent with the original ZIF-8 morphology. Figure S4 (c) and S4 (d) show the 2.5% Cu NC-8 and 10% Cu NC-8 catalysts obtained from pyrolysis of Cu-ZIF-8. The diamond-shaped dodecahedral structure of the two catalysts collapsed to a certain extent, only retaining the blurred particle profile. Remarkably, the morphology of the 2.5% Cu NC-8 and 10% Cu NC-8 catalysts is also similar, and the agglomeration situation is almost the same, indicating that the morphology of the catalyst is not controlled by the amount of Cu added. Figure S4 (e) illustrates the high-angle ring darkfield scanning (HADDF-STEM) image and element mapping of 2.5% Cu NC-8. It can be seen that the C, N, O, Cu and Zn elements are uniformly distributed on the catalyst, and no metal nanoparticles are observed at this region.

The X-ray diffraction (XRD) results of 2.5% Cu NC-8 and 10% Cu NC-8 are displayed in Figure 6(a) for analyzing the crystal phase structure. Both the 2.5% Cu NC-8 and 10% Cu NC-8 catalysts own graphitic carbon and metallic Cu (PDF#04-0836). Comparing the diffraction peak intensity of the two catalysts, the crystal phase content of Cu in the 2.5% Cu NC-8 catalyst visibly decreases. It demonstrates that when the amount of Cu<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> drops to 2.5%, only a very small amount of Cu<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> ions are reduced to metallic Cu during the pyrolysis process, and most of Cu2<sup>+</sup> ions are anchored by N atoms to form Cu N catalytic active sites.

The Raman spectra (Figure 6(b)) were carried out to explore the effect of Cu<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> amount on the graphitic carbon. The ID/IG of 2.5% Cu NC-8 (1.110) is significantly lower than that of 10% Cu NC-8 (1.128), which indicates that the higher the graphitization degree of 2.5% Cu NC-8.

XPS analysis was performed on 2.5% Cu NC-8 to evaluate the surface elemental composition (Figure 7). The existence of C N bond and C=N bond in the C 1s of 2.5% Cu NC-8 catalyst (Figure 7(a)) indicates that N atoms are successfully doped in **Figure 5.** The LSV curves of Zn NC,Cu NC-8, and Cu NC <sup>L</sup> with (dashed the carbon skeleton. The high-resolution N 1s spectra of 2.5%

Cu NC-8 catalyst is shown in Figure 7(b). The atomic and relative content of different N species are listed in Table S2. The M N content (2.16 at%) and graphitic-N content (1.16 at%) of 2.5% Cu NC-8 catalyst is higher than those of 10% Cu NC-8. The increase of M N content indicates that the activity density of the catalyst is higher, which is more beneficial to capture of O2 and oxygen reduction intermediates (like \*OOH) to catalyze the reduction reaction. At the same time, according to the references, graphite-nitrogen can increase the initial reduction potential of ORR.

For the Cu 2p and Zn 2p spectra in Figure 7(c) and 7 (d), respectively, both Zn and Cu are in a mixed valence state, Zn<sup>0</sup> / Zn<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> and Cu0 /Cu2<sup>+</sup>, which the transformation of oxidation state and reduction state contributes the perfect activity of ORR.

To assess the electrocatalytic performance of 2.5% Cu NC-8 and 10% Cu NC-8 for ORR, the CV tests and LSV curves were carried out in a typical three-electrode system at the scan rate of 20 mV s <sup>1</sup> in N2-saturated and O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH electrolyte, respectively. As can be seen in the Figure 8(a), compared with the CV curves in N2-saturated solution, a distinct ORR peak in O2-saturated solution was clearly observed, suggesting the ORR catalytic activity for 2.5% Cu NC-8 and 10% Cu NC-8. Figure 8(b) shows the LSV curves of the prepared catalysts and commercial 20 wt.% Pt/C in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte. The two prepared catalysts have similar limit current density (2.5% Cu NC-8: iL=5.0 mAcm <sup>2</sup> , 10% Cu NC-8: iL= 4.8 mAcm <sup>2</sup> ). However, the *E*onset (0.97 V) and *E*1/2 (0.82 V) of 2.5% Cu NC-8 are slightly higher than that of 10% Cu NC-8 (*E*onset=0.93 V and *E*1/2=0.81 V), which is closer to that of commercial 20 wt.%Pt/C (*E*onset=1.01 V and *E*1/2=0.852 V). The H2O2 yield and the electron transfer number were monitored at the appropriate potential window by the rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE), as shown in Figure 8(c). Obviously, within 0.2 V–0.8 V, the averaged electron transfer numbers are 3.88

and 3.76 for 2.5% Cu NC-8 and 10% Cu NC-8 (Figure 8(d)), respectively, which means that the ORR mechanism of all them follows the direct "4e " pathway. The ORR is a multi-electron step reaction and one of the most significant intermediates is H2O2 generated through the 2e pathway. Therefore, the yield of H2O2 is an important criterion for judging performance of catalysts. As shown in Figure 8(d), the H2O2% of 2.5% Cu NC-8 is only about 5.9% at the potential range from 0.2 V to 0.8 V. Both the data of H2O2% and n indicate low selectivity for hydrogen peroxide and few by-products in the reaction process of 2.5% Cu NC-8.

LSV measurements were performed for 2.5% Cu NC-8 and 10% Cu NC-8 at various rotation rates (400-1600 rpm) and scan speeds of 10 mV s 1 , and the corresponding kinetic parameters were analyzed by the Koutecky-Levich (K L) equation (1) and equation (2):

$$j^{-1} = j_k^{-1} + j_L^{-1} = j_k^{-1} + B^{-1}\omega^{-1/2}$$
 (1)

$$B = 0.62nFCo(Do_2)^{2/3}v^{-1/6}$$
 (2)

where *j*, *j*L, and *j*<sup>K</sup> are the current density, limiting current density and kinetic current density in the electrochemical test, respectively; *ω* is electrode rotation speed; *F* is the Faraday constant (96485 CmoL <sup>1</sup> ); *C0* is the bulk concentration of O2 in the electrolyte (1.2×10 <sup>6</sup> mol cm <sup>3</sup> ); *D0* is the diffusion coefficient of O2 (1.9×10 <sup>5</sup> cm2 s 1 ), and *ν* is the kinematic viscosity of 0.1 M KOH solution (0.01 cm2 s 1 ).

As shown in Figure 9(a) and 9(b), the 2.5% Cu NC-8 and 10% Cu NC-8 catalysts show almost identical *Eonset* at different speeds, but the limit diffusion current density gradually increases as the speed increases. The K-L plots of 2.5% Cu NC-

8 and 10% Cu NC-8 (inset in Figure 9(a) and (b)) show a good linear relationship at 0.3 V to 0.7 V, indicating that ORR is a firstorder dynamic process.[33] Based on the K L equation, the kinetic current densities of 2.5% Cu NC-8, 10% Cu NC-8, and commercial 20 wt.% Pt/C catalysts are calculated at 0.8 V. As shown in Figure 9(c), the *j*<sup>K</sup> of 2.5% Cu NC-8 (8.76 mAcm <sup>2</sup> ) is higher than that of 10% Cu NC-8 (8.37 mAcm <sup>2</sup> ), revealing that 2.5% Cu NC-8 has a significantly faster ORR kinetic process. The Tafel slopes of 10% Cu NC-8 and commercial 20 wt.% Pt/C (65.15 mVdec <sup>1</sup> and 72.56 mVdec <sup>1</sup> ) are steeper than that of 2.5% Cu NC-8 (62.15 mVdec <sup>1</sup> ) (shown in Figure 9(d)), which indicates that a relatively high catalytic current density can be obtained at low overpotentials.[34] It means that the first electron transfer is likely to be the rate determining step (RDS) in the ORR catalyzed by this catalyst. The above calculation results of kinetic current density and Tafel slope show that the dynamic reaction rate of 2.5% Cu NC-8 is faster than other catalysts.

In addition, the stability of the catalyst is a very significant indicator for evaluating its commercialization. In the O2 saturated environment, 10000 cycles of CV tests were carried out on the 2.5% Cu NC-8 catalyst at a scan rate of 100 mVs 1 . Surprisingly, as shown in the Figure 10, after 10000 cycles, the *E*1/2 of the catalyst decreased by only 19 mV. Comparing the H2O2% before and after accelerated stress tests only increased from 5.9% to 8.2%, and the electron transfer number decreased from 3.88 to 3.2. It can be seen that the performance weakening of 2.5% Cu NC-8 after accelerated stress tests is very small, which proves that its stability is very excellent.

## **Conclusions**

In summary, we compared the Cu-based catalysts with different structures obtained by diverse preparation methods of ZIFs, and obtained a simple pyrolysis strategy to construct a lowcopper-loaded on carbon electrocatalyst for ORR. The Cu NC-8 catalyst was obtained from the high-temperature pyrolysis of Cu-ZIF-8 with Cu N active sites dispersed on the N-doped carbon catalyst. The N-doped carbon was generated at the same time during the pyrolysis of Cu-ZIF-8. During the process of high-temperature calcination, there are some rich N-coordination vacancies for anchoring Cu to form the Cu N due to part of the Zn volatilization. It exhibits excellent ORR activity and long-term stability, even Cu is slightly loaded. At the same time, the N atoms which are successfully doped into the carbon skeleton can adjust the electronic density of adjacent C atoms. It is more conducive to the adsorption of O2 on the electrocatalyst.

## **Synthesis of ZIF-8, Cu-ZIF-8, and Cu-ZIF-L**

In a typical ZIF-8 synthesis procedure,[36] 2-methylimidazole (6.490 g) was dissolved in 200 mL of methanol with constant stirring. Simultaneously, Zn(NO3)2 ·6H2O (2.930 g) was dissolved in 200 mL of methyl alcohol under vigorous stirring. Then, Zn(NO3)2 solution was slowly poured into the 2-methylimidazole solution, and continuously stirred vigorously for 5 h at room temperature. Finally, white powders (ZIF-8) were obtained by centrifugation, methanol washing, and vacuum drying at 60°C for 12 h.

2199692x, 2023,

For synthesis of the Cu-ZIF-8, the prepared ZIF-8 was used as a reactant. 100 mg of ZIF-8 was dispersed in 10 mL of n-hexane by sonication. Then, the 100 mg mL $^{-1}$  copper nitrate aqueous solution with different volume (100, 25  $\mu$ L) was added dropwise, and stirring for about 6 h. Finally, the Cu-ZIF-8 powder was collected by the same steps as the ZIF-8 powder.

In order to compare the catalytic mechanism of different configuration catalysts, Cu-ZIF—L was prepared. <sup>[35]</sup> 2-methylimidazole (0.55 g) was dissolved in 60 mL deionized water (DI water) with constant stirring to form a uniform solution (solution A). 0.72 g of Cu(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>·3H<sub>2</sub>O and 0.59 g of Zn(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>·6H<sub>2</sub>O also were dissolved in 60 mL of DI water to obtain the blue solution of Cu(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> and Zn(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> (solution B). Then, the solution B was rapidly poured into solution A, and vigorously stirred the mixture at room temperature for 5 h. The gray-blue precipitate was centrifuged and washed with methanol for three times, and dried in vacuum for 12 h at 60 °C. The product was named Cu-ZIF—L.

#### Synthesis of Zn-NC, Cu-NC-8 and Cu-NC-L

Cu–NC-8 electrocatalyst was synthesized by annealing Cu-ZIF-8. Specifically, the dried Cu-ZIF-8 powder was ground and heat treated at 900°C for 2 h in the atmosphere of following Ar. The ramping rate was 5°C min<sup>-1</sup>. After cooling to room temperature naturally, the black powders were collected. The final product was expressed as Cu–NC-8, which is named 10% Cu–NC-8 and 2.5% Cu–NC-8 according to the proportion occupied by Cu.

Cu-ZIF—L and ZIF-8 were calcined in the atmosphere of following Ar at 900 °C for 2 h through the same steps as above to obtain black powders were Cu—NC—L and Zn—NC, respectively.

#### Characterization method

The morphology of the as-prepared catalysts is observed by transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEM-2100) that is operated at 200 KV. The high-angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) and elemental mapping are performed using a Talos F200X TEM to observe the distribution of elements in the catalysts. The crystal structures of the as-prepared catalysts are determined with the X-ray diffraction (XRD) on D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer utilizing Cu–K $\alpha$  radiation ( $\lambda$ =1.5406) at 40 KV and 15 mA. The Raman spectra are collected by confocal Raman spectroscopy (LabRAM HR, Horiba J.Y., France), which is equipped with a visible 514.5 nm argon atom laser and an advanced Leica microscope (long-range objective 50). The chemical state of the catalysts was characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) on a Thermo Scientific K-Alphab+ system.

#### Electrochemical measurement

Electrochemical performance was tested on Autolab electrochemical workstation (Metrohm, PGSTAT 302 N) coupled with the three-electrode system (rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE) or rotating disk electrode (RDE) as the working electrode) in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte. The graphite rod electrode and an Ag/AgCl electrode (saturated KCl solution) were served as the counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively. The catalyst ink was prepared by ultrasonicate the mixture containing of 5 mg of the prepared catalysts, 950  $\mu$ L of absolute ethanol, and 50  $\mu$ L of Nafion® solution (5 wt.%). The ink was dropped on the RRDE with total catalyst loading of almost 400  $\mu$ g cm<sup>-2</sup>.

All the measured potentials were converted to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) by equation (3). Prior to the electro-

catalytic measurements, the electrolyte was purged with  $O_2$  (99.9%) for at least 30 min to confirm that the test is in an  $O_2$ -saturated environment. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed at a scan rate of 5 mV s<sup>-1</sup>, and the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was performed at various rotation rates (400–2000 rpm) with a sweep rate of 10 mV s<sup>-1</sup>. The number of electrons transferred (n) and the  $H_2O_2$  yield were calculated according to the equation (4) and (5) with detected ring current ( $i_R$ ), disk current ( $i_D$ ), and the current collection efficiency (N = 37%):

$$E (vs. RHE) = E (vs. Ag/AgCI) + 0.0592 pH + 0.1989$$
 (3)

$$H_2O_2\% = 200 \times \frac{i_R/N}{i_D + i_R/N}$$
 (4)

$$n = 4 \times \frac{i_D}{i_D + i_R/N} \tag{5}$$

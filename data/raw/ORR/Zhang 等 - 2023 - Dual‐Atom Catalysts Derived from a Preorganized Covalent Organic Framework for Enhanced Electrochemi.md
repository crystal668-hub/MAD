**Abstract:** Dual-atom catalysts (DAC) are deemed as promising electrocatalysts due to the abundant active sites and adjustable electronic structure, but the fabrication of well-defined DAC is still full of challenges. Herein, bonded Fe dual-atom catalysts (Fe2DAC) with Fe2N6C8O2 configuration were developed through onestep carbonization of a preorganized covalent organic framework with bimetallic Fe chelation sites (Fe2COF). The transition from Fe2COF to Fe2DAC involved the dissociation of the nanoparticles and the capture of atoms by carbon defects. Benefitting from the optimized *d*-band center and enhanced adsorption of OOH\* intermediates, Fe2DAC exhibited outstanding oxygen reduction activity with a half-wave potential of 0.898 V vs. RHE. This work will guide more fabrication of dualatom and even cluster catalysts from preorganized COF in the future.

#### *Introduction*

Dual-atom catalysts (DAC) have been attracting extensive attention due to their adjustable electronic structure and unique synergetic effects, which can regulate the adsorption energy of targeted intermediates and improve the atom utilization.[1–5] The fabrication of DAC can be realized through controlling the metal content, while the obtained

product tends to randomly disperse on the supports or inevitably form metal nanoparticles (NPs), leading to limited diatomic configurations.[6–8] A competitive complexation strategy has been proposed, where small molecules containing N, O, S, etc. coordinate with targeted bimetals, then carbon supporting DAC are obtained through carefully conducted pyrolysis (Figure S1a, Supporting Information).[9–13] Molecule-assisted carbonization enables precise control in the precursors, but it also suffers from extra carbon sources and molecular sublimation influences, resulting in uneven bulk shape and uncertain inner diatomic configurations.[13–15] Recently, the nodes or cavities of metal– organic framework (MOF) are used to organize the dual atoms, which can be realized by one-step carbonization to fabricate DAC (Figure S1b, Supporting Information).[16–20] Although the use of MOF can avoid the dilemma encountered for small molecules-based strategy, they also endure high metal content resulting in the complex post-treatment including additional pickling and carbonization activation.[19, 20] Therefore, it is necessary to develop a more effective and convenient strategy to prepare controllable diatomic structure.

Covalent organic framework (COF) is an emerging class of highly ordered and rigid polymers, which have been deemed as ideal precursors of functional carbons for electrocatalysis and batteries.[21–24] By selecting suitable monomers, coordination sites can be elaborately designed in the COF's skeleton for precise number of metal anchoring.[25–28] Therefore, COF can achieve a preorganized function in localized regions just similar to molecule-assisted strategy and still have advantages of porous and ordered structure of MOF. In addition, the abundant carbon source and adjustable metal content make COF have great potential in the preparation of DAC by a facile one-step pyrolysis. However, no similar strategy has been reported so far, to the best of our knowledge.

Herein, we designed a hollow-structured COF with preorganized bimetallic chelating sites (P-COF) through the reaction between tetrakis(4-aminophenyl)ethene (ETTA) and 3,3',5,5'-tetraformyl-4,4'-biphenyldiol (TFBD) monomers. The local coordination environment within P-COF can coordinate two atoms simultaneously (Scheme 1). Fe2COF was obtained by the coordination of N/O atoms of P-COF with dual Fe atoms. Furthermore, well-defined bonded Fe DAC (Fe2N6C8O2 configuration) supporting on porous carbon were fabricated through direct carbonization of Fe2COF. The structural transformation from Fe2COF to Fe dual-atom catalysts (Fe2DAC) has been carefully probed

via ex situ extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EX-AFS), and a process involving the dissolution of nanoparticles and the capture of carbon defects was proposed. Fe2DAC exhibits improved oxygen reduction activity compared to the Fe single atom catalyst (SAC) due to the enhanced adsorption of key intermediates as revealed by the theoretical calculations.

## *Results and Discussion*

## *Synthesis and characterization of P-COF and Fe2COF*

ETTA and TFBD were firstly dissolved in a mixture of N,Ndimethylacetamide/mesitylene/acetic acid (10: 2: 1 by volume), which was heated in a reaction kettle at 120 °C for 48 h to form P-COF (see Supporting Information for details). Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra shows that the characteristic peak of TFBD ( CHO) at 1681 cm <sup>1</sup> obviously declined, while a peak at 1618 cm <sup>1</sup> indicative of C=N appeared, indicating the formation of P-COF (Figure S2, Supporting Information). In addition, the solid-state 13C NMR spectrum shows the formation of C=N group as evidenced by the signal at 156 ppm (Figure S3, Supporting Information). As shown in the powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) spectra (Figure 1a), the as-prepared P-COF exhibits peaks at 8.23°, 11.61°, 16.24° and 20.96°, reflecting the (110), (200), (220), and (001) crystallographic planes, respectively. The possible lattice models (Figure S4, Supporting Information) with AA and AB stacking for the P-COF were established. The simulated PXRD pattern of AA stacking is consistent with the experimental one (*R*p= 3.25%, *R*wp=5.71%), which proves the crystal data of the P-COF (*a*=*b*=15.30 Å, *c*=4.21 Å, *α*=*β*=*γ*=90.0°, Table S1, Supporting Information). P-COF owns two types of rhomboid pore with sizes of 0.7 and 1.3 nm, exhibiting heterosporous characteristics (Figure 1b). Interestingly, the chicken-foot-like structure consisting of O atom and two N atoms can be observed at the pore size of 0.7 nm (Figure S5, Supporting Information). The permanent porosity of P-COF was characterized by the nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms at 77 K. P-COF presented a type-I isotherm with

significant increase under low relative pressures (*P*/*P*0*<* 0.05), demonstrating a typical microporous structure (Figure S6, Supporting Information). The Brunauer–Emmett– Teller (BET) surface area of P-COF is 614.7 m<sup>2</sup> g <sup>1</sup> , indicating its high specific area (Figure S6, Supporting Information). What's more, the pore size distribution is mainly concentrated at 0.68 and 1.27 nm as calculated by the density functional theory, which are in good agreement with the simulated structures. Small molecules with chicken-foot-like structures based on the reported literature can chelate two metals and control the distance between them (Figure S5, Supporting Information).[29, 30] In this work, the chicken-footlike structure is elaborately designed in the P-COF, which are expected to chelate dual metals to realize the preorganized coordination configuration.

Fe2COF with bimetallic sites was fabricated by immersing the P-COF into a solution containing Fe ions. Fe2COF has a similar crystal structure to P-COF (Figure 1a), while the Raman spectra shows difference in the wavenumber of 1400 cm <sup>1</sup> (Figure S7, Supporting Information), indicating the coordination between Fe ions and N/O atoms. The Fe 2p X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectrum shows that the Fe exists in the form of Fe2<sup>+</sup> (Figure S7, Supporting Information). Furthermore, the coordination configuration of Fe2COF was verified by EXAFS, indicating the existence of the Fe O Fe structure (Figure S8, Supporting Information). According to the simulated crystal structure of Fe2COF (Figure 1c), the N and O atoms at the chicken-foot sites can bind dual Fe atoms simultaneously. In addition, the distance between adjacent two Fe atoms is 0.3 nm, which is close to the reported molecular diatomic distance.[29]

The morphology of P-COF and Fe2COF was further studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). P-COF is in the form

of hollow sphere with an average size of 300 nm (Figure S9, Supporting Information). In order to explore the formation mechanism of this special hollow morphology, the timedependent studies were performed through collecting intermediate products at different reaction time intervals (1, 24 and 48 h). Solid sphere can be found at the primary stage of the reaction (1 h), which is consistent with the aboard amorphous peaks of XRD (Figure 2a, Figures S10 and S11, Supporting Information). FT-IR and Raman technology show the initial products is full of amino and aldehyde groups (Figure S12, Supporting Information), indicating the incomplete reaction. Many nano particles are observed from the surface at the higher magnification, resulting in rough surface, revealing the subsequent possible transformation (Figure S10, Supporting Information). While the reaction time prolongs to 24 h, a core-shell structure forms, in which the core and shell are ball and leaf, respectively (Figure 2b, Figure S10, Supporting Information). Meanwhile, the ordered structure formed as indicated by the XRD pattern and FT-IR and Raman spectra (Figures S11 and S12, Supporting Information). The well-defined hollow spheres appear after 48 h, which are composed of numerous nanoleaves, forming hierarchical hollow structure (Figure 2c, Figure S10, Supporting Information). The formation mechanism of the hollow structure can be attributed to the Ostwald ripening process accompanied by the disappearance of initial quickly formed kinetic products and the generation of more stable thermodynamic products (Figure S13, Supporting Information), which is consistent with the reported hollow COF.[31, 32] Furthermore, another COF with similar hollow shape was obtained through this one-pot synthesis method (named as P-COF'), in which the TFBD linker was simply replaced with biphenyl-3,3',5,5'-tetracarbaldehyde (Figure S14–S16, Table S2, Supporting Information). Due to the lack of -OH group in P-COF', the chicken-foot like structure can not form, resulting in only N atom has ability

to bind introduced metal ion to form single metal site (Figure S15, Supporting Information).

Fe2COF inherits the hollow spherical shape of P-COF without any obvious change in morphology (Figure 2d,e). Fast Fourier transformed TEM images show the obvious lattice fringes of 0.44 nm, which is in accordance with the simulated model of (001) face (Figure 2f). Moreover, the elemental mapping images show that the Fe2COF are composed of C, N, O, and Fe atoms with Fe atoms distributed homogeneously (Figure 2g).

#### *Synthesis and characterization of Fe2DAC*

Nitrogen doped porous carbon with Fe2DAC was fabricated through direct pyrolysis of Fe2COF at 900 °C under argon atmosphere. The as-prepared catalyst was firstly examined by XRD. Only two abroad peaks at 26° and 44° from amorphous carbon was found (Figure S17, Supporting Information).[33, 34] Inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) shows that the content of the Fe atoms in Fe2DAC is �3.8%. As displayed in Figure 3a–c, the Fe2DAC catalysts maintain the original hollow spherelike shape. Aberration-corrected high-angle annular darkfield scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) images show numerous bright dots, demonstrating the existence of well-dispersed Fe atoms (Figure 3d). Dual Fe atoms can be easily found in the magnified STEM images (Figure 3e, Figure S18, Supporting Information). The distance between adjacent dual Fe atom is approximately 2.23 Å according to the analysis by randomly selected 3 areas (Figure 3f), which is close to that (3 Å) in the

Fe2COF. Dual Fe atoms are also can be easily observed in the elemental mapping images, further demonstrating the formation of DAC (Figure 3g). In addition, C, N, and O atoms distributed homogeneously in the Fe2DAC (Figure 3g). N 1s XPS spectrum shows that the N-containing species of Fe2DAC are composed of pyridinic N, pyrrolic N, graphitic N and oxidized N (Figures S19 and S20, Supporting Information). Among them, the pyrrolic N occupies the highest ratio, which may promote the 4 e transfer for electrochemical oxygen reduction (Table S3, Supporting Information).[35, 36] These results unveil that DACs with dualmetal Fe centers can be realized by direct pyrolysis of COF with well preorganized bimetallic sites. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt of fabricating DAC from COF with specific coordination sites.

The structure transformation from Fe2COF to Fe2DAC was further revealed by the TEM, Raman, and EXAFS spectroscopy. The derived products are named as Fe2COF-RT, Fe2COF-300, Fe2COF-500, Fe2COF-700, and Fe2DAC-900, where the number is the carbonization temperatures. TEM images show that all samples own the similar hollow sphere shape, and no obvious aggregation was found (Figure S21, Supporting Information). The Raman signal displays significant difference until the temperature reaches 500 °C, which can be ascribed to the disappearance of the organic skeleton and the formation of carbon (Figure S22, Supporting Information). The local structural environment of Fe atoms in Fe2DAC was further characterized by EXAFS. The Fe K edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) analysis of Fe2COF-RT, Fe2COF-300, Fe2COF-500, Fe2COF-700, and Fe2DAC were recorded (Figure 4a, Figure S23, Supporting Information). Fe2COF-RT, Fe2COF-300 and Fe2COF-500 have similar near-edge absorption to the FeO, indicating that the valence state of Fe in Fe2COF-RT, Fe2COF-300 and Fe2COF-500 is close to +2. Fe2COF-700 shows similar near-edge absorption to the Fe2O3, demonstrating that the valence state is close to +3. For Fe2DAC, the near-edge absorption is between the FeO and Fe2O3, indicating that the valence state ranges from +2 and +3. EXAFS experiment was further conducted to confirm the coordination environment of the samples (Figure 4b, Figure S23, Supporting Information). Fe2COF-RT and Fe2COF-300 displayed two peaks around 1.73 and 2.86 Å, which can be ascribed to the signal of Fe N(O) and Fe O Fe, respectively. In addition, the broad peak at 2.86 Å for Fe2COF-300 indicates the generation of Fe2O3, which may be originated from the heat treatment. When the heating temperature increases to 500 °C, new board peaks can be observed between 2 and 3 Å of Fe Fe and Fe O Fe, which can be ascribed to formation of Fe NPs and Fe2O3. For Fe2COF-700, the weak signal at 1.55 Å and the sharp peak at 2.51 Å prove the formation of Fe N and Fe Fe, respectively. However, when the temperature was set at 900 °C, the main peak become the Fe N and Fe Fe, indicating the formation of Fe dual atom (Fe2DAC).

Furthermore, due to the powerful resolution in both k and R spaces, the Fe K edge wavelet transform (WT)- EXAFS was adopted to explore the atomic configuration of Fe2DAC and the reference samples (Figure S24, Supporting Information). The highest WT intensity at �4.1 Å <sup>1</sup> belongs to the coordination of Fe2DAC between Fe and N(O), while an intensity maximum of �6.2 Å <sup>1</sup> corresponding to Fe Fe coordination was also observed, which is consistent with the above discussion. The EXAFS fitting was further adopted to identify the local coordination environment of the Fe atoms in Fe2DAC. Given that the existence of O atoms in the precursor (Fe2COF), we did the second shell fitting. The best fitting curves matched well with the experimental spectra, indicating that the diatomic Fe site of Fe2DAC appears as Fe2N6C8O2 coordination (Figure 4c, Figure S25, Supporting Information), in which the bond length of Fe N, Fe Fe, Fe N C and Fe N O is 1.875, 2.556, 3.886, and 3.371 Å, respectively (Table S4, Supporting Information). Figure 4d illustrates the transformation from Fe2COF to Fe2DAC with change of the temperature. Fe atoms coordinates with the reserved bidentate site, forming Fe O Fe bond, then transform into Fe2O3 (300 °C). When the temperature reaches 500 °C, the framework of COF transforms into carbon skeleton, and Fe NPs (Fe Fe) can be found. Fe dual atoms can be observed at 700 °C, while the main phase is Fe NPs. With increasing temperature up to 900 °C, the well-defined Fe dual atoms are formed.

For comparison, Fe SAC was obtained through the pyrolysis of P-COF' with single Fe site (Figure S26, Supporting Information). Meanwhile, we also find only SAC have been fabricated through the direct pyrolysis of COF in the reported cases,[37–40] which may be ascribed to the single metal site of COF. These results indicate the importance of the COF's preorganized dual atom structure for fabricating DAC. We speculate that the diatomic sites in precursor may produce carbon defects occupying diatoms during the pyrolysis process, which may capture atoms under higher temperature, thus forming dual atom sites. In general, the transformation from Fe2COF to Fe2DAC involves the dissolution of nanoparticles and capturing atoms by carbon defects, which is consistent with the recently reported results.[41]

#### *Electrocatalytic ORR performance of Fe2DAC*

The Fe2DAC was further evaluated for ORR. As shown by the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves (Figure 5a), the half-wave potential of Fe2DAC is 0.898 V vs. RHE (Figure 5b), which is much higher than those of the Fe SAC (0.841 V), C P COF (0.721 V), and Pt/C (0.863 V), outperforming most of the reported advanced catalysts (Table S5, Supporting Information). Moreover, the kinetic current density (*j*k) of Fe2DAC at 0.88 V (14.82 mAcm <sup>2</sup> ) is about 15 times larger than that of the Fe SAC, indicating synergistic effect between the adjacent Fe atoms. As shown in Figure 5c, Fe2DAC possesses the lowest Tafel slope of 57 mVdec <sup>1</sup> , demonstrating fast ORR kinetics.[42–44] To calculate the electron transfer number (*n*), LSV curves at various rotating rates from 625 to 2025 rpm were collected (Figure 5d). The *n* is calculated to be around 3.92 via the Koutecky–Levich (K–L) equation, indicative of a fourelectron pathway (Figure S27, Supporting Information). Additionally, Fe2DAC exhibited outstanding stability with no obvious decay during the 20 h (Figure S28, Supporting

*Figure 5.* a) and b) ORR LSV plots, comparison of *E*1/2 and *J*<sup>k</sup> current density at 0.88 V vs. RHE for the as-prepared catalysts at rotation rate of 1600 rpm in 0.1 M KOH. c) the Tafel slope of the as-prepared catalysts. d) ORR LSV plots at various rotating rates. e) In situ EIS spectra of Fe2DAC from 0.82 to 0.92 V vs. RHE. f) Polarization curve and the corresponding power density curves of the Zn-air battery.

Information), which was also demonstrated by XRD, XPS and SEM (Figure S29, Supporting Information).

In situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is a powerful tool to study the kinetic and thermodynamic parameters related to electrochemical processes, which can be used to monitor the electron transfer and kinetics of electrocatalytic reactions.[45–47] One phase peak observed in the low-frequency region (10 <sup>1</sup> Hz–103 Hz) shifts toward higher frequencies with decreasing the potential (Figure 5e). According to the literature, this phase peak is commonly attributed to the formation of reaction intermediates at the surface.[48] The apparent transition peak of Fe2DAC is located at 0.90 V, which is more positive than that of Fe SAC (0.88 V), indicating its better kinetics (Figure S30, Supporting Information).

Given its outstanding ORR activity, we investigated the Fe2DAC in Zn-Air batteries (Figure S31, Supporting Information). The open circuit potential of the batteries is 1.49 V, and the max power density is 325.8 mWcm <sup>2</sup> , which are much larger than those (1.47 V and 131.3 mWcm <sup>2</sup> ) of the control battery (Pt/C) (Figure 5f, Figure S32, Supporting Information), making Fe2DAC competitive for practical applications. Furthermore, the Fe2DAC battery showed good stability at different current densities (Figure S33, Supporting Information), outperforming the control battery. As expected, a small fan can be successfully launched by using two of our Zn-air batteries (Figure S34, Supporting Information).

#### *Mechanistic study of Fe2DAC for ORR*

In situ Raman measurement was conducted to probe the interface information of Fe2DAC during the ORR process. The signal at 1060 cm <sup>1</sup> intensifies with decreasing the potential from 1.0 to 0.85 V vs. RHE, which can be ascribed to the O O stretching vibration of the O2 species (Figure 6a).[49, 50] The peaks at 1302 and 1596 cm <sup>1</sup> are the Dband and G-band of the carbon,[51] respectively. No distinct differences for these two characteristic peaks can be found with potential, confirming that the active intermediates are mainly adsorbed at the dual atom sites.

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were further adopted to figure out the origin of the high ORR activity. For comparison, the optimized structures of the \*OOH, \*O, and \*OH intermediates on both Fe2DAC and Fe SAC are displayed (Figure 6b, Figure S35, Supporting Information). Dual Fe sites in Fe2DAC and Fe SAC possess accordant downhill energy pathway at *U*=0 V, indicating a spontaneous exothermal process (Figure S36, Supporting Information). At the equilibrium potential (*U*=1.23 V), the steps of O2 to \*OOH on both Fe2DAC and Fe SAC are uphill (rate determining step). Dual Fe atom sits of Fe2DAC has a lower overpotential (0.211 V) than that of single Fe atom site of Fe SAC structure (0.479 V), suggesting a more efficient ORR activity for Fe2DAC due to the synergy of dual atoms. These results all reveal that the key intermediate is the \*OOH (Figure 6c). Therefore, the calculated difference charge densities for adsorption of \*OOH on Fe2DAC and Fe SAC were further adopted to study the

differences in electronic structure between them. The charge mainly transfers from active metal site to N atom in both cases. It should be noted that the amount of the transferred charge on dual Fe atom site (0.66 e) is larger than that on single Fe atom site (0.45 e), indicating the stronger interaction between \*OOH and Fe2DAC (Figure 6d,e).[52, 53] To further illustrate the effect of the dual atoms on ORR activity, partial density of states and *d*-band center were adopted to analyze the electronic properties. The *d*-band center of the Fe2DAC is much closer to the Fermi level than Fe SAC (Figure 6f), indicating enhanced adsorption and stronger electronic interactions with \*OOH intermediates,[54–56] thus reducing the energy barrier of the reaction, and improving the ORR kinetics.

#### *Conclusion*

In conclusion, we designed and fabricated a COF with preorganized bimetallic chelation sites, which serves as a precursor for carbon supported bonded Fe DAC with Fe2N6C8O2 configuration. The ex situ EXAFS analysis and Raman technology reveal that the transformation process from COF to DAC involves the dissolution of nanoparticles and atomic capture by carbon defects. Fe2DAC exhibited an outstanding electrochemical oxygen reduction activity with half-wave potential of 0.898 V vs. RHE and a high kinetic current density at 0.88 V vs. RHE 15 times larger than that of the Fe SAC. In situ Raman and EIS technology unveil that the dual-Fe sites have enhanced adsorption of OOH\* intermediates. DFT calculations show that the *d*-band center and charge transfer for Fe2DAC are improved. This work not only provides new insights into fabricating DAC for ORR, but also offers valuable guidance for the future design of DAC and multinuclear cluster based on COF.

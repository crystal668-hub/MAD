A porous carbon material was synthesized using waste tire granules via pyrolysis. Six non-platinum-group metal catalyst materials were synthesized based on this carbon material, Fe(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub> · 9H<sub>2</sub>O, and either dicyandiamide or guanidine carbonate as the nitrogen source. Synthesis parameters such as pyrolysis temperature, precursor mass ratios, and acid washing time were varied for each material. All catalysts were characterized physically using HR-SEM, SEM-EDX, and N<sub>2</sub> sorption analyses as well as electrochemically using the rotating disk electrode method in 0.1 M KOH. The materials were rich in nanofibers, and exhibited moderate porosity and specific surface area ( $S_{\rm BET} = 77$ -194 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>). By modifying the synthesis parameters of the materials, the electrochemical properties were successfully improved, achieving  $E_{\text{onset}} = 0.92 \text{ V}$  vs RHE and  $E_{1/2} = 0.82 \text{ V}$  vs RHE (Fe-guan III 900). The number of transferred electrons in the ORR was n = 4 for the more active materials.

#### Introduction

Extensive use of non-renewable energy sources and excessive accumulation of hard-to-recycle waste, such as end-of-life tires, are among the most significant environmental problems today. Waste tires are usually burned or stored in landfills, which, in addition to health and environmental risks, are far from being sustainable ways to recycle tires. (1–5) Therefore, finding new solutions for energy recovery and disposal of special waste is essential. Fuel cells that use green hydrogen could provide one way to produce energy that is carbon emission free. For this reason, low-temperature fuel cells are researched and used to provide a green alternative to internal combustion engines in vehicles. However, one problem with fuel cells is that they rely heavily on expensive platinum. Non-platinum-group metal (NPGM) catalysts, such as iron and nitrogen co-doped carbon materials, are good contenders to platinum-based catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (3,6–10). Porous carbon materials are often used as a main precursor to provide electrical conductivity and oxygen mass transport to active sites.

Different organic materials can be used to synthesize high-tech porous carbons suitable for NPGM catalysts for use in fuel cells. Waste tires contain over 200 components, mainly natural and synthetic rubbers (~46%), carbon black (5-22%), steel (16.5-25%), textiles (~5%), ZnO (~1%), sulfur (~1%), TiO<sub>2</sub>, and SiO<sub>2</sub>. The total carbon content in waste tires is therefore quite high (68-75%), making it a good source of carbon

(2,3,11). As waste tires are abundant and hard to recycle, finding new uses for end-of-life tires is important from an environmental point of view (5). A lot of research has been done on obtaining activated carbon from waste tires and using them for different applications ranging from wastewater treatment to battery materials (4,11), but using such carbon to synthesize fuel cell catalysts remains relatively unexplored, with only a few examples discussed in the literature (3,10,12). Synthesizing porous carbon materials for more economically viable NPGM fuel cell catalysts could provide one way to use waste tires more sustainably and lower the cost of efficient fuel cell catalysts.

 In this paper, novel NPGM catalyst materials based on carbon synthesized from waste tire granules were explored. More specifically, six iron-based NPGM catalysts were synthesized using two different nitrogen sources (guanidine carbonate and dicyandiamide) and by varying precursor ratios and pyrolysis temperatures. The materials were characterized using various physical characterization methods as well as the rotating disk electrode (RDE) method.

## **Experimental**

### Catalyst synthesis

 A carbon material was synthesized by pyrolyzing tire granules (Imdex A/S) at 1000 °C for three hours in Ar. The carbon was then ball-milled (FRITSCH Pulverisette 6) with zirconia balls (d = 20 mm). More details about the carbonization method and the characteristics of carbon have been detailed in a previous paper (13).

 The carbon material was modified to synthesize several iron and nitrogen co-doped catalyst materials. Fe(NO3)3 · 9 H2O (Sigma-Aldrich, ≥ 99.0%) was used as the iron source, dicyandiamide (Sigma-Aldrich, 99%) or guanidine carbonate (Sigma-Aldrich, 99%) as the nitrogen source, and ZnCl2 (anhydrous, ACS reagent, ≥ 97%, Sigma-Aldrich) as a pore structure modifier. For each material, the precursors were mixed in a small amount of ethanol, treated with a high-shear mixer and ultrasound, and then dried using a rotary evaporator. The dried mixture was pyrolyzed at fixed temperatures between 800-1000 °C (depending on the material) for 1.5 hours in Ar. All synthesized materials were acid washed for 4-8 h (1 M HNO3, 80 °C) to remove redundant elements such as Zn from the pore modifier, non-active Fe not bound to active sites, and various impurities originating from the tire granules (mainly Si, S, Ca, and Zn). Finally, each material was pyrolyzed again under the same conditions as in the first pyrolysis step.

 The preparation conditions (pyrolysis temperature, choice of nitrogen compound, and precursor ratios) of the materials are shown in TABLE I. The materials are denoted in the paper based on their composition and pyrolysis temperature. The nitrogen compound is indicated as "DCDA" for dicyandiamide and "guan" for guanidine carbonate. The roman numerals (I, II, III) refer to the composition of the material (combination of precursor to carbon support mass ratios). Finally, the numbers (800, 900, 1000) refer to the pyrolysis temperature in °C. For the materials where this number is not stated, the pyrolysis temperature was 800 °C.

**TABLE I.** Synthesis conditions and precursor ratios.

| Material         | Pyrolysis        | Acid wash    | N source compound   | N-C   | Fe-C  | ZnCl2<br>-C |
|------------------|------------------|--------------|---------------------|-------|-------|-------------|
|                  | temperature (°C) | duration (h) |                     | ratio | ratio | ratio       |
| Fe-DCDA I        | 800              | 4            | Dicyandiamide       | 10:1  | 1:1   | 10:1        |
| Fe-DCDA II       | 800              | 4            | Dicyandiamide       | 10:1  | 1:2   | 20:1        |
| Fe-guan I        | 800              | 8            | Guanidine carbonate | 10:1  | 1:1   | 10:1        |
| Fe-guan III 800  | 800              | 8            | Guanidine carbonate | 20:1  | 1:1   | 10:1        |
| Fe-guan III 900  | 900              | 8            | Guanidine carbonate | 20:1  | 1:1   | 10:1        |
| Fe-guan III 1000 | 1000             | 8            | Guanidine carbonate | 20:1  | 1:1   | 10:1        |

 Fe-DCDA I was pyrolyzed at 800 °C using the precursor ratios marked in TABLE I. To examine how the electrochemical activity and porosity changes depending on the Fe and pore modifier (ZnCl2) content, half the amount of Fe and twice the amount of ZnCl<sup>2</sup> were added to synthesize Fe-DCDA II.

 For the next materials, guanidine carbonate was used as the nitrogen source instead of dicyandiamide. Acid washing for 4 h did not prove efficient in removing additives, according to the SEM-EDX analysis of Fe-DCDA I and Fe-DCDA II. The duration of the acid washing was thus increased to 8 h for all guanidine-based materials. SEM-EDX analyses showed that Fe-guan I had a lower quantity of N than desired, and the recipe was changed to include twice the amount of N (Fe-guan III). In hopes to further improve the activity of the materials toward the ORR, the pyrolysis temperature was raised to 900 and then to 1000 °C.

### Physical and electrochemical characterization methods

 High resolution scanning electron microscopy (HR-SEM, Zeiss Merlin, 3 keV) and energy dispersive X-ray analysis (SEM-EDX, Bruker EDX-Xflash®, 8 keV) were used to evaluate the morphology and composition of the catalyst materials. Before each measurement, the samples were coated with a thin Au/Pd layer (0.5 nm).

 N2 sorption was carried out to measure the properties of the porosity of the materials. The samples were first degassed at 100 °C for 24 h at 0.05 mbar. Measurements were carried out in liquid nitrogen temperatures (*T* = 77 K). The specific surface area (*S*BET) was calculated according to the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller theory (BET) (14). The pore size distribution as well as the total volume of pores (*V*tot) and the volume of micropores (*V*micro) of the catalysts were obtained using SAIEUS software. (15)

 The electrochemical measurements were carried out in a three-electrode cell using the rotating disk electrode (RDE) method. The catalytic activity of the materials toward the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) were measured in alkaline solution (0.1 M KOH, 99,99%, semiconductor grade, Sigma-Aldrich). For each measurement, a suspension of the investigated material was prepared using water, isopropyl alcohol, and Nafion® solution (~5% suspension, Sigma-Aldrich, Aldrich Chemistry). A glassy carbon electrode was coated with the suspension and the suspension was allowed to dry at room temperature. The loading of all the materials was approximately 0.30 mg cm-2. A glassy carbon rod was used as the counter electrode and the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) for the reference electrode. All potential values in this paper are presented as potential values vs RHE. A rotator (Pine Instrumental Company) and a Gamry Reference 600TM potentiostat (Gamry Instruments) were used to measure RDE data. Current density and electrode potential relations were measured at different rotation speeds (from 500 to 3000 rpm) in the potential range of *E* = 0.23 to 1.25 V vs RHE at a potential scanning rate of *ν* = 10 mV s-1 .

## **Results and discussion**

# Physical characterization

 SEM-EDX was used to examine the elemental composition of the materials (TABLE II). The catalysts contain 74-78% carbon and 8-13% oxygen, Fe and N content are consistent with the respective precursor ratios. Additionally, some Si and S are present in the materials. This is expected, as waste tires contain SiO2 as a filler material and S as a residue from the vulcanization process of rubber (1,4,16).

 Fe-DCDA II was synthesized with half the amount of Fe(NO3)3 · 9 H2O and twice the amount of ZnCl2 compared to Fe-DCDA I, and contains slightly less Fe and almost twice Zn, as confirmed by SEM-EDX. As acid washing for 4 h did not prove efficient in removing additives such as Zn (Fe-DCDA I and Fe-DCDA II), its duration was increased to 8 h for Fe-guan I. This resulted in a decrease in Zn content, however, a decrease of N was also seen. Interestingly, almost twice as much nitrogen remains in Fe-DCDA I compared to the Fe-guan I materials. This is the case despite the fact that the number of nitrogen atoms per unit mass is almost the same for both nitrogen compounds and the mass ratios of the starting materials have remained unchanged. For this reason, the guanidine content was doubled for the Fe-guan III materials and the SEM-EDX results confirm that N doping in a larger amount was successful. Considering the three Fe-guan III materials synthesized at different pyrolysis temperatures, a decrease in N content is observed with the increase of the pyrolysis temperature. This phenomenon has also been described by other researchers (8,17). A higher pyrolysis temperature also seems to remove more residual Zn from materials. In conclusion, regardless of the synthesis conditions, Fe and N doping of the carbon material was successful.

 HR-SEM images (Figures 1 and 2) reveal porous, granular morphology in all materials, with particles of various sizes. This variety creates a structure where larger particles are surrounded by small particles, which could improve the mass transport rate in the ORR reaction zone and could thus increase the ORR activity of the porous materials (18). At lower magnification (Figure 1), Fe-DCDA I and Fe-DCDA II seem to have larger, separate agglomerates as well as more free space around them. In contrast, the particles in the guanidine-based materials seem more interconnected.

Figure 1. HR-SEM images for synthesized NPGM materials (noted in figure), at 1000x magnification.

 Viewing on larger magnification (Figure 2), one feature common among all materials is the presence of nanofibers. The elemental composition of the nanofibers was confirmed to be similar to other parts of the material (C ~80%, Fe ~4%, and N ~8% for Fe-DCDA I according to SEM-EDX). It has been previously reported in the literature that Fe and DCDA catalyze the formation and the growth of nanotubes which are believed to improve the stability of NPGM carbon materials (18). The Fe-DCDA materials have a large amount of discrete, long fibers that are strongly intertwined. Of the two, Fe-DCDA II has a much higher number of nanofibers. Compositionally, Fe-DCDA II has a higher ZnCl2 to C precursor ratio (20:1 compared to 10:1) and lower Fe to C precursor ratio (1:2 compared to 1:1) next to Fe-DCDA I.

Figure 2. HR-SEM images for synthesized NPGM materials (noted in figure), at 15000x magnification.

Of the Fe-guan materials, Fe-guan I has a visually similar proportion of nanofibers compared to Fe-DCDA I (both had identical precursor ratios). Fe-guan III 800, 900, and 1000, which have twice the amount of N precursor compared to Fe-guan I, look quite similar in the SEM images, and their nanofibers are not as evident. All in all, the material with a higher ZnCl<sub>2</sub> content and the materials with a lower N precursor content have a larger number of nanofibers.

According to the  $N_2$  sorption analysis data (Figure 3), all materials exhibit a moderate specific surface area ( $S_{\rm BET}$  = 77-194 g m<sup>-2</sup>) (TABLE III). Carbons synthesized from waste tires (13,16) generally have a lower specific surface area and porosity than, for example, carbide or peat derived carbon NPGM catalysts (6,7). High micro- and mesoporosity is desired in such NPGM materials, since they provide better oxygen mass transport and thus an increase in ORR activity (9,19). The ratio of micropore volume to total volume for all materials was calculated to be in the range of 15 to 24%. Such relatively small specific surface area and pore volume are typical for NPGM catalysts synthesized from tire carbon (2,3,5). At the same time, the specific surface area as well as micro- and mesopore volumes, depend significantly on the carbonization method and treatment conditions, as shown by Muhyuddin *et al.* (3). They described tire-based Fe-N/C catalysts with  $S_{\rm BET}$  values ranging from 85 to 671 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>, depending on the synthesis conditions applied.

Figure 3. Pore size distributions for the studied materials (noted in figure).

Fe-DCDA II, having a higher  $ZnCl_2$  content, has nearly twice the  $S_{BET}$  and higher microporosity ratio (TABLE III) compared to Fe-DCDA I. The effect of  $ZnCl_2$  on porosity is expected as it is known to increase porosity in carbonaceous catalyst materials (7). The ratio of micropore volume to total pore volume remains similar in the guanidine-based materials, even when synthesis conditions such as precursor ratios and pyrolysis temperature are changed. From this, one can conclude that the mentioned synthesis conditions do not affect the porosity of catalysts noticeably.

#### Electrochemical characterization

The RDE method was used to evaluate the oxygen electroreduction activity of the synthesized NPGM catalysts. The current density versus electrode potential curves (Figure 4) for the studied catalysts were recorded in O<sub>2</sub> saturated 0.1 M KOH solution at an electrode rotation rate of 2000 rpm. All data were corrected against the ohmic potential drop, and the background current density values measured in Ar saturated solution.

The onset potential ( $E_{\rm onset}$ ) and the half-wave potential ( $E_{\rm 1/2}$ ) are shown in Figure 4.  $E_{\rm onset}$  is the potential where the current density j=-1 A m<sup>-2</sup> and  $E_{\rm 1/2}$  is found by taking the potential value at the global maximum of the first derivative of the E vs j curve (20). Based on the  $E_{\rm onset}$  and  $E_{\rm 1/2}$  values, the ORR activity in 0.1 M KOH increased as follows: Fe-guan II  $\approx$  Fe-guan III 1000 < Fe-guan III 800 < Fe-DCDA II  $\approx$  Fe-DCDA I < Fe-guan III 900.

Figure 4. ORR curves of the synthesized materials (noted in Figure) in 0.1M KOH solution at an electrode rotation rate of 2000 rpm and the  $E_{\rm onset}$  and  $E_{1/2}$  values for each material.

Fe-DCDA II has a much higher S<sub>BET</sub> compared to Fe-DCDA I, and therefore a higher activity toward the ORR should be expected. However, the electrochemical results show that Fe-DCDA II and Fe-DCDA I have the same  $E_{1/2}$  and  $E_{onset}$  values: 0.90 V and 0.81 V vs RHE, respectively. Thus, a material with a higher specific surface area is not always a better ORR catalyst. Muhyuddin et al. also showed that a Fe-N/C material with a lower surface area ( $S_{\text{BET}} = 85.3 \text{ m}^2 \text{ g}^{-1}$ ) was electrochemically more active than materials with a higher  $S_{\text{BET}}$  (3). Using guanidine instead of dicyandiamide in the NPGM synthesis first showed a drop in both  $E_{1/2}$  and  $E_{onset}$ , which could be due to a low N content in the material (TABLE II). Fe-guan III used twice the amount of nitrogen precursor, which resulted in a higher N content and brought a positive shift in  $E_{1/2}$  and  $E_{onset}$ . By raising the pyrolysis temperature to 900 °C, a significant improvement can be seen: Fe-guan III 900 achieved the best electrochemical results ( $E_{\text{onset}} = 0.92 \text{ V vs RHE}$ ,  $E_{1/2} = 0.82 \text{ V vs RHE}$ ). Yet, increasing the pyrolysis temperature further to 1000 °C led to a decrease in ORR activity. Therefore, it is possible to synthesize waste tire based ORR catalysts that are comparable to other recently described NPGM materials (3,10,21). The electrochemical characteristics of the best NPGM catalyst obtained in this work are in a good agreement with other tire derived Fe-N/C materials found in the literature, for example, with data by Muhyuddin et al. (3), who presented a catalyst with  $E_{\text{onset}} = 0.917 \text{ V}$  vs RHE and  $E_{1/2} =$ 0.841 V vs RHE.

The number of transferred electrons (*n*) was calculated for each catalyst material through plots created using the Koutecký-Levich equation (22):

$$\frac{1}{j} = \frac{1}{j_{k}} + \frac{1}{j_{d}} = \frac{1}{j_{k}} + \frac{1}{B\omega^{\frac{1}{2}}},$$
[1]

where the measured, kinetic and diffusion current densities are marked as j,  $j_k$ , and  $j_d$ , respectively; the rotation speed of the electrode is  $\omega$ , and B is defined as:

$$B = n \,\mathrm{F} \,D_0^{\frac{2}{3}} \,\vartheta^{-\frac{1}{6}} \,C_0^0 \,, \tag{2}$$

where *n* is the number of electrons transferred in the ORR step, F is Faraday's constant,  $D_{\rm O}$  is the diffusion coefficient of oxygen ( $D_{\rm O} = 1.9 \times 10^{-5} \text{ cm}^2 \text{ s}^{-1}$ ),  $\vartheta$  is the kinematic viscosity of the solution ( $\vartheta = 0.01 \text{ cm}^2 \text{ s}^{-1}$ ), and  $C_{\rm O}^0$  is the concentration of oxygen in the solution ( $C_{\rm O}^0 = 1.2 \text{ mol m}^{-3}$ ). (23)

The value of n describes the ORR mechanism at the active sites of the catalyst and is another characteristic used to evaluate electrochemical activity (22). The best NPGM catalysts reach an n value equal to 4, which indicates a direct 4-electron reaction process. Others may have n < 4, which indicates a so-called 2+2-reaction (24). The n values of the studied NPGM catalysts vary from 3.5 to 4. In many NPGM materials, the electron transfer number is close to 4, which is why the ORR here is mostly a 2+2 process. The Fe-guan III materials showed the best results by reaching the ideal n = 4 value, which makes them perfectly suitable for anion exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFC). Muhyuddin et al. (3) also obtained n values close to 4 for their tire-derived Fe-N/C catalysts.

Based on the experimental results, Fe-guan III 900 is a promising catalyst material for the ORR. Having obtained very good  $E_{\rm onset}$ ,  $E_{\rm 1/2}$ , and n values, further experiments in an anion exchange membrane assembly should be made to evaluate its potential for use in fuel cells.

#### Conclusion

Six non-platinum-group metal (NPGM) catalysts were synthesized using carbon prepared from waste tires, a nitrogen source (either dicyandiamide or guanidine carbonate), and Fe(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>· 9H<sub>2</sub>O as precursors. Additionally, ZnCl<sub>2</sub> was added as a pore modifier. Various synthesis parameters were altered, including precursor mass ratios, time of the acid wash, and pyrolysis temperature.

The materials were physically characterized using HR-SEM, SEM-EDX, and  $N_2$  sorption analysis methods. According to the HR-SEM images, all materials were porous and granular and had nanofibers in varying amounts. SEM-EDX results showed that the materials were mainly composed of C and O, while Fe and N contents were proportional to the amount of respective precursors used.  $N_2$  analyses showed that the materials have a moderate specific surface area ( $S_{BET} = 77-194 \text{ m}^2 \text{ g}^{-1}$ ). The rotating disk electrode (RDE) method was used to evaluate the electrochemical activity of the materials toward the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).

The most efficient NPGM catalyst was found to be Fe-guan III 900. This catalyst was synthesized using guanidine carbonate as the nitrogen source, pyrolyzed at a temperature of 900 °C, and acid washed for 8 hours. Based on RDE measurements, the onset and half-wave potentials were found to be 0.92 and 0.82 V vs RHE, respectively. The number of transferred electrons (n) was found to be close to or equal to 4 for all studied materials. In conclusion, waste tire based carbons can be used to manufacture efficient and active NPGM catalysts for the ORR that are comparable in activity to other NPGM catalysts. Furthermore, as the number of transferred electrons n for the best materials reached the ideal value of 4, they can be considered as good candidates to be studied further in anion exchange membrane fuel cells.

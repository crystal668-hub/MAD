**Abstract:** Low-cost and high-efficiency oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysts are the basis for large-scale applications of electrochemical energy storage and conversion technologies such as fuel cells and metal-air batteries. Herein, cobalt and oxygen vacancy-rich cobalt oxide encapsulated in nitrogen-doped carbon and carbon nanotubes (Co/CoO@NC-CNTs) have been prepared by direct solid-state pyrolysis of Co-MOF. The carbon morphology, oxygen vacancy content and type of nitrogen can be finely tuned by mixing Co-MOF with proper amounts of melamine. The optimized material has an interwoven CNT structure with abundant micro- and mesopores, suitable nitrogen type and certain number of oxygen vacancies and exhibiting outstanding ORR electrocatalytic performance in alkaline media with an onset potential of 0.96 V and a half-wave potential of 0.88 V vs RHE, which is higher than 20 wt% Pt/C, as well as being highly stable and well resistant to methanol.

## **Introduction**

The energy consumption and pollution of conventional energy conversion technologies have become a potential hazard to the Earth's ecosystem and to the future development of humanity. Renewable energy has the potential to be an important driver of development, and oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) are a key component of energy conversion and storage devices, including high-efficiency fuel cells and renewable metal-air cells.[1] However, the inherently slow kinetics of the oxygen reduction multiple electron transfer process severely limits its development and application,[2] and its reliance on resourcelimited and expensive precious metal-based catalysts will also certainly increase the costs associated with industrialization.[3] Therefore, it is critical to develop cost-effective, earth-abundant and highly ORR active electrocatalytic materials to drive the commercialization of new energy devices.[4]

Tremendous efforts have been devoted to develop nonnoble metal-based catalysts for ORR[5] and among these cutting-edge materials, transition metal-based nitrogen-doped carbon materials (M N-C) have garnered considerable attention lately due to a major variety of features, including high electrical, and chemical properties.[6] Previous studies have shown that M N-C exhibits superior electrocatalytic activity comparable to that of Pt-based electrocatalysts toward ORR process owing to the nitrogen-doped carbon-protected metal species structure and synergy between transition metals and Ndoped carbon, which greatly improve the activity and stability of the catalyst.[7] In particular, the transition metal-based nitrogen-doped carbon nanotube (M-NCNT) series showed good electrocatalytic performance toward ORR due to their high porosity, moderate N doping and high electrical conductivity[8] However, M N-C materials prepared by conventional synthetic strategies often suffer from aggregation of metal active centers and non-uniform distribution of active centers.[9]

It is ample evidence that orderly distributed metal, N and C is crucial for efficient catalytic activity as well as stability and use of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as self-sacrificing templates have shown to produce M N C with ordered distribution of active sites.[10] For example, Zhang and his group members fabricated a Cu, Co-embedded nitrogen-enriched mesoporous carbon framework (CuCo@NC) and this catalyst exhibits impressive ORR performances.[7a] Abdoulkader Ibro Douka prepared an interconnected microporous carbon matrix with a well-defined 3D architecture by pyrolysis of silica templated ZIF-67 and this matrix catalyst assembled zinc-air battery exhibits a high power density and excellent stability.[11]

Improving the electrical conductivity and regulating electronic structure are efficient strategies to enhance the intrinsic activity for electrocatalysts.[1] In order to obtain better catalytic activity, coating the desired MOF crystals onto various conductive substrates (such as carbon nanotubes, graphene, carbon aerogel, and others) and subsequent carbonization, indeed avoiding agglomeration and improving charge transport.[12] For instance, liang's group used ZIF-67 as a precursor and prepared GCN Co@CoO hybrid electrocatalyst by simple pyrolysis with graphene oxide.[7c] Graphene nanosheets as a conductive agent and binder not only connect the metallic cobalt species nanoparticles to the carbon material, but also the synergistic effect of nitrogen-doped carbon and metallic cobalt makes the catalyst exhibit excellent ORR activity in alkaline medium. Wang's group constructed a type of sandwiched-like non-noble electrocatalyst (FeNC/rGO) with highly dispersed FeNx active sites embedded in a hierarchically porous

carbon/graphene heterostructure using Fe doped ZIF-8 and this type of catalyst exhibits excellent ORR activities.<sup>[4a]</sup> However, this method of growing MOFs on conductive substrates still suffers from non-uniform distribution and difficulty in growth.

Herein, a series of N-doped carbon-carbon nanotube matrixencapsulated Co and CoO nanoparticle electrocatalysts (Co/ CoO@NC-CNTs) were obtained by simple pyrolysis of Co-MOF and melamine. Surprisingly, It is found that some oxygen vacancies exist in this series of materials. Profited from this unique architecture, the Co/CoO@NC-CNTs composites have the following benefits: (i) The synergistic effect between metal species nanoparticles, oxygen-deficient and N-doped carbon and suitable N species ensures a sufficient number of ORR active sites. (ii) The homogeneous embedding of Co and CoO nanoparticles in the N-doped carbon-carbon nanotube matrix not only prevents aggregation of nanoparticles and contributes to improved electronic conductivity, but also the carbon layer protects the particles from corrosion and facilitates long-term stability. (iii) The CNTs generated on the surface of the carbon matrix provide a large surface area that facilitates charge transfer during the ORR process. In achieving all these features simultaneously, this Co/CoO@NC-CNTs catalysts exhibit high activity and excellent stability comparable to that of commercial Pt/C.

#### **Results and Discussion**

Co/CoO@NC-CNTs catalysts were carried out as shown in Scheme 1 (see supporting Information for details). Co-MOF was prepared by solvothermal treatment of terephthalic acid, 4,4′-bipyridine and Co(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>·6H<sub>2</sub>O at 200 °C for 24 h. Then, the obtained Co-MOF crystals were mechanically grinded with melamine in a certain weight ratio until well mixed. The ratio of Co-MOF to melamine 1:1, 1:5 and 1:10 are named Co/CoO@NC-CNTs-1, Co/CoO@NC-CNTs-5 and Co/CoO@NC-CNTs-10, respectively. The product obtained by direct pyrolysis of Co-MOF without melamine is named Co/CoO@NC. The as-prepared Co-MOF and all catalysts were characterized by powder XRD, and the results are shown in Figure S1 and Figure 2A. It can be seen that all peaks of the Co-MOF are in good agreement with

the simulated pattern of Co(tp)(bpy) from the literature<sup>[13]</sup> (Figure S1), indicating that it is a crystallinity-rich material in its pure phase state.<sup>[13]</sup> As shown in Figure 2A, XRD plots of the catalysts Co/CoO@NC-CNTs and Co/CoO@NC confirm that all samples have diffraction peaks of Co and CoO. The strong peaks at 36.49°, 42.38° and 61.49° for all samples can be assigned to the (111), (200) and (220) planes of CoO (JCPDS No. 48–1719), while the peaks at 44.21° and 51.52° can be attributed to the (111) and (200) planes of metal Co nanoparticles (JCPDS No. 15–0806). Comparing the XRD plots of Co/CoO@NC-CNTs and Co/CoO@NC, there is a clear broad peak for Co/CoO@NC-CNTs at 26.48°, which can be attributed to graphitic carbon (002),<sup>[14]</sup> but this peak is not found in Co/CoO@NC, indicating the introduction of melamine can enhance the graphitization.

The morphology and microstructure of the prepared samples were further investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The SEM images (Figure S3) present that the Co/CoO@NC-CNTs show typical CNTs structure, but no CNTs structure is found in Co/CoO@NC, demonstrating that melamine played an important role in the formation of CNTs. Meanwhile, the quantity and size of CNT can be adjusted by changing the amount of melamine added. When the addition amount was 1:1 (Figure S3 C-D), a small amount of CNTs appeared on the surface of the material. when the additioncovered the surface of the material, but the size varied and some parts were not converted into CNTs. when the addition amount was changed to 1:10 (Figure S3 G-H), the surface of the material was completely covered by carbon nanotubes and the size of the carbon nanotubes became uniform. SEM images of Co/CoO@NC-CNTs-10 show that the catalyst surface displays an interesting 3dimensional CNT network in which many uniformly sized CNTs are intertwined with each other. Notably, the surface of Co/ CoO@NC-CNTs-10 is composed of regular nanotubes with an average diameter of 12 nm (Figure 1A-B). The TEM images reveal that graphitic carbon layers are present on the walls of the CNTs (Figure 1B and C) with a crystalline spacing of 0.34 nm, corresponding to the (002) crystalline surface of graphitic carbon. At the same time, the Co nanoparticles are securely wrapped in multiple layers of carbon shells (the gap between lay in a multilayer carbon shell (the gap between layers is also 0.34 nm). The d-spacing in these nanoparticles was measured to be 0.19 nm, which corresponds to the (111) crystal plane of the Co mental. In addition, for the inner regions of the material embedded Co and CoO nanoparticles were wrapped by graphitic carbon layers (Figure 1D). This composite nitrogendoped carbon substrate/CNTs structure can facilitate ion and electron transport in electrocatalytic processes, and graphitic carbon improves electrical conductivity while protecting Co and CoO nanoparticles from corrosion.[15] The element mapping displays the uniform distribution of C, N, O and Co elements in Co/CoO@NC-CNTs-10. (Figure 1E and 1F)

 $\rm N_2$  adsorption-desorption measurement was conducted to evaluate the specific surface area and pore structure of the catalysts. As shown in Figure 2B, the four catalysts exhibited Type IV adsorption-desorption isotherms over the entire pressure range and a clear hysteresis curve was observed,

indicating the presence of mesoporous structures in the materials. [16] The BET surface areas of Co/CoO@NC, Co/CoO@NC-CNTs-1, Co/CoO@NC-CNTs-5 and Co/CoO@NC-CNTs-10 were 85 m²g $^{-1}$ , 179.6 m²g $^{-1}$ , 225 m²g $^{-1}$  and 236.4 m²g $^{-1}$ , respectively. From the pore size analysis plots (Figure 2C), it is obvious that all samples have some micro-pores, while the number of mesopores increases drastically with the addition of melamine, which should be related to the formation of the CNT structure. The large surface area and the graded porous structure give more opportunities for the catalytic active site to approach the reactants and facilitate the reaction.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to determine the elemental composition and chemical bonding of all catalysts. As shown in Table S1, the N content of the Co/ CoO@NC-CNTs was significantly higher than that of Co/ CoO@NC, indicating that the melamine had been successfully incorporated into the catalyst as an additional N source. The high-resolution N 1s XPS spectrum of all samples (Figure 2D) contained three peaks at 398.2 eV, 399.5 eV, 400.1 eV and 401 eV, corresponding to pyridine N, Co-N<sub>x</sub>, pyrrole N and graphite N, respectively.[17] Compared to other prepared catalysts, Co/CoO@NC-CNTs-10 had significantly higher pyridine and graphite nitrogen contents and pyridine nitrogen was the major component. It is worth mentioning that pyridinic N and graphite nitrogen are thought to have a good function in the catalytic materials for ORR that are made of carbon-based materials.[18]

As shown in Figure. 2E, the high resolution spectrum of O 1s could be divided into three peaks at 528.8 eV, 530.9 eV and 532.8 eV, which are assigned to lattice oxygen, defective oxygen and hydroxyl oxygen, respectively.[19] The largest defective oxygen content (66.8%) is found when comparing Co/CoO@NC-CNTs-10 with other fabricated catalysts (Table S2), indicating that the introduction of melamine during high temperature carbonation would generate a large number of oxygen vacancies. Oxygen vacancies have been reported to adjust the electronic structure and coordination environment of metals and metal oxides to reduce the activation energy and thus improve electrochemical performance. [20] By comparing the Co 2p xps spectra (Figure 2F) of Co/CoO@NC and Co/CoO@NC-CNTs samples, it can be seen that the Co 2p region of Co/ CoO@NC-CNTs is shifted to the right compared to that of Co/ CoO@NC, which indicates that a slight reduction happens (Co<sup>2+</sup>

This also proof the existence of oxygen vacancies.<sup>[21]</sup> Raman spectra of Co/CoO@NC and Co/CoO@NC-CNTs-10 (Figure. S4) was measure to further confirm the formation of oxygen vacancies. As can be seen from the spectral profiles, the vibrational peak of Co/CoO@NC at 681 cm<sup>-1</sup> is the dominant Co—O vibrational peak. The dominant Co—O vibrational peak of Co/CoO@CNTs-10 is shifted to the left and broadens compared to Co/CoO@NC, indicating the presence of oxygen vacancies.<sup>[21]</sup>

Due to the unique nanostructure and compositional characteristics, these samples are expected to have excellent catalytic activity towards ORR. As shown in Figure. 3 A, compare to Co/CoO@NC, all of Co/CoO@NC-CNTs catalysts exhibit higher onset potential and half-wave potential, which may be related to the

synergetic effect between metallic species nanoparticles, oxygen defects and N-doped carbon-CNTs. Among the Co/ CoO@NC-CNTs, Co/CoO@NC-CNTs-10 exhibits the highest of onset potential and half-wave of 0.96 and 0.88 V vs RHE, which is comparable to commercial Pt/C catalysts and superior to the fact that most of the previously reported N-doped carbon catalysts (Table S3). Furthermore, the Tafel slopes for Co/ CoO@NC-CNTs-10 is 79.2 mV dec-1 which is lower than Pt/C, indicates the fast reaction kinetics of ORR (as shown in Figure 3B). The reason for the excellent electrochemical ORR performance of Co/CoO@NC-CNTs-10 may be the fact that this porous carbon-carbon nanotube structure is rich in mesopores and micropores, which facilitate the transfer of protons or diffusion of reactive gases during ORR. In addition, the oxygen vacancies on the CoO promote the adsorption of O<sub>2</sub> on the catalyst surface, which also contributes to the catalytic performance. The high electrical conductivity of carbon materials and metal particles, the large number of oxygen vacancies enhancing the adsorption of O2, and the well-developed pore structure greatly facilitate the transfer of electrons and masses, ensuring excellent catalytic efficiency in ORR. On the other hand, the variation of the type and content of nitrogen in the material is also related to the performance of the ORR. According to the analysis of N1s XPS spectra, Co/CoO@NC-CNTs-10 has the highest nitrogen content and the largest proportion of pyridine-type nitrogen and graphite-type nitrogen, which may also contribute to the enhanced catalytic behavior of the ORR.

An electron transfer number of 3.90 can be derived from the Koutecky-Levich (K–L) equations (calculated by equations 1, 2, 3) for Co/CoO@NC-CNTs-10 based on the LSV profiles at different speeds. This value indicates that the mechanism of ORR is an evident four-electron transfer pathway. To further validate the reaction pathways for ORR, rotating ring disc electrode (RRDE) measurements were carried out on this material (shown in Figure 3F). The electron transfer number determined from RRDE measurements is nearly 4.0 (calculated by equation 4), which suggests a four-electron pathway of ORR process. In addition, the hydrogen peroxide yield at the range of 0.2 V to 0.9 V is 14% (calculated by equation 5), confirms that four-electron pathway dominate the ORR process on Co/ CoO@NC-CNTs-10. Furthermore, Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used to get further insight into the conductivity and charge trans-port capacity of catalysts (Figure. 3D).

EIS demonstrates CNT network could improve conductivity.

It has already been established that the long-term working ability of the catalyst is a significant indication for assessing the performance of ORR, and that it is thus critical to assess the stability of the catalyst. Using chronoamperometry in a 0.1 M KOH solution that was saturated with oxygen, the material's endurance was determined. As shown in Figure 3I, the Co/CoO@NC-CNTs-10 catalyst retained around 81% of its initial catalytic activity after 40 hours of testing, which is much better than the 28% current density loss of Pt/C after 12 hours of testing, demonstrating that the electrode exhibits excellent

long-term stability. In addition, in the LSV diagram before and after the test (Figure. S7), the small decrease of the initial potential and limiting current of the material can also indicate its excellent stability. The methanol resistance of the catalyst was studied, and the CV curve of Co/CoO@NC-CNTs-10 exhibited nearly little change following the addition of 1 M methanol again, with no noticeable methanol oxidation peak, demonstrating that the catalyst has excellent selectivity for the ORR process. (Figure. 3H) It is undeniable that these data demonstrate that the Co/CoO@NC-CNTs-10 catalyst has exceptional oxygen reduction activity and electrochemical endurance.

#### Conclusion

To summarize, Co/CoO@NC/CNTs-10 catalyst was effectively synthesized utilizing CoMOF as a precursor by melamine-

assisted pyrolysis. The obtained Co/CoO@NC/CNTs-10 exhibits remarkable ORR catalytic activity in alkaline solution. The excellent electrocatalytic performance of Co/CoO@NC/CNTs-10 can be attributed to unique porous structure with the synergistic effect of metallic species NPs, oxygen defects and N-doped carbon, which can provide many electrocatalytic active sites for electrocatalysis, as well as excellent electron transfer, thus improving the kinetics of the catalytic process. This work provides important insights for the design of highly active electrocatalysts for ORR.

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed on a talos F200X microscope. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were performed on X'Pert 3 X-ray diffractometer with Cu K $\alpha$  radiation. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data were recorded using a Thermo Scientific ESCALAB Xi+. A nitrogen adsorption-desorption method (SSA-4200) was used to investigate the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) specific surface area characterizations. The Raman spectra were collected on a HORIBA HR Evolution spectrometer using a 633 nm laser.

Electrochemical experiments were carried out in a conventional three-electrode battery using CHI760E electrochemical workstation. The glass carbon electrode modified by the prepared sample (GC of diameter 5 mm) was used as the working electrode. Platinum wire and Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl solution) electrode were used as counter electrode and reference electrode respectively.

Synthesis of Co-MOF:  $Co(NO_3)_2 \cdot 6H_2O$  (2.5 mmol), terephthalic acid (5 mmol), 4,4′-bipy (5 mmol) and NaOH (10 mmol) were dissolved in 50 mL distilled water. The above-mentioned reactants were added to a 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and kept at 200 °C for 24 h. After naturally cooled to room temperature, the precipitates were collected by centrifugation. Then washed for three times with ethanol and finally dried in a vacuum oven at  $60\,^{\circ}\text{C}$  over-night to obtain the Co-MOF.

**Synthesis of Co/CoO@NC:** The as-prepared Co-MOF was placed in a ceramic boat, and then heated in a tube furnace at a ramp rate of 2°C min<sup>-1</sup> to 800°C for 2 h in Ar atmosphere. After cooling naturally, the black product of Co/CoO@NC was collected.

Synthesis of Co/CoO@NC-CNTs: The prepared Co-MOF and melamine were placed in an agate mortar. Then the mixture in mortar was uniformly ground. The resulting mixture was placed in a ceramic boat, and then heated in a tube furnace at a ramp rate of  $2\,^{\circ}$ Cmin $^{-1}$  to  $800\,^{\circ}$ C for  $2\,$ h in Ar atmosphere. After cooling naturally, the resultant samples were denoted as Co/CoO@NC-CNTs-n (n represent the ratio of melamine and Co-MOF, n=1/5/10).

A glassy carbon rotating disk electrode (RDE) with the catalyst coated a glassy carbon rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) with the catalyst coated was used as working electrode, where the prepared electrodes immersed in a  $O_2$ - or  $N_2$ - saturated 0.1 M KOH solution, using saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the reference electrode, and carbon rode as the counter electrode. All measured potentials in the figure were converted to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). The potential vs RHE was calibrated as  $E_{\text{RHF}} = E_{\text{SCF}} + 0.059 \times \text{pH} + 0.241$ .

Then 5  $\mu$ l of catalyst ink was smeared on the rotating disk electrode (5 mm in diameter) and 5  $\mu$ L of the dispersion was loaded onto the rotating ring-disk electrode

(5.5 mm in diameter). The loaded electrode dries slowly and naturally in the air.

The measured LSV curves were carried out at various rotating speed from 400 to 2400 rpm with a sweep rate of 5 mV s<sup>-1</sup> in an N<sub>2</sub>-saturated 1.0 M KOH electrolyte. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves were evaluated on RDE in O<sub>2</sub>-saturated and N<sub>2</sub>-saturated solution at a scanning rate of 50 mV s<sup>-1</sup>. The average electron transfer number (n) and kinetic current density ( $J_k$ ) can be calculated from Koutecky-Levich equations (1–3):

$$\frac{1}{J} = \frac{1}{J_1} + \frac{1}{J_{\nu}} = \frac{1}{R\omega^{1/2}} + \frac{1}{J_{\nu}} \tag{1}$$

$$B = 0.62 \ nFC_0(D_0)^{2/3} v^{-1/6} \tag{2}$$

$$J_{K} = nFkC_{0} \tag{3}$$

Where J, J<sub>K</sub>, and J<sub>L</sub> are the measured current density, kinetic current density, and diffusion-limited current density, respectively. The diffusion-limited current is determined by the number of electrons transferred (n), the Faraday constant (F), the concentration of dissolved O<sub>2</sub> in solution (C<sub>0</sub>), the diffusion coefficient of O<sub>2</sub> (D<sub>0</sub>), the kinetic viscosity of the solution (v), and the rotation speed of the electrode (w).where J is the measured current density, J<sub>K</sub> and J<sub>L</sub> are the kinetic and limiting current densities  $\omega$  is the angular velocity of the disk, n is the electron transfer number, F is the Faraday constant, C<sub>0</sub> is the bulk concentration of O<sub>2</sub>, D<sub>0</sub> is the diffusion coefficient of O<sub>2</sub> in 0.1 M KOH, and V is the kinematic viscosity of the electrolyte.

The hydrogen peroxide yield ( $H_2O_2$ %) and average electron transfer number based on RRDE measurements can be determined by the following equation 4 and 5:

$$n = \frac{4I_D}{I_D + \frac{I_R}{M}} \tag{4}$$

$$y_{H_2O_2} = 100 \frac{2I_R/N}{I_D + I_R/N} \tag{5}$$

Among them,  $I_D$  is the disk current,  $I_R$  is the ring current, and N is the RRDE collection efficiency (0.38).

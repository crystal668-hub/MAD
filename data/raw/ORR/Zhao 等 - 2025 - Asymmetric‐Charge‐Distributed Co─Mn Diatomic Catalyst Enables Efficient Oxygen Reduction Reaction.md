Transition metal (TM)-nitrogen/carbon (M-N/C) catalysts have emerged as the most promising alternatives to precious platinum catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, the reported M-N/C catalysts typically exist in TM-N<sub>4</sub> coordination with symmetric charge distribution, resulting in weak adsorption energies for ORR intermediates, which limits the reaction rate. Herein, a novel asymmetrically coordinated Co-Mn diatomic catalyst is synthesized through the adsorption-pyrolysis process of a bimetallic zeolitic imidazolate framework. The catalyst consists of the adjacently sulfur/nitrogen dual-coordinated Co atoms and the nitrogen-coordinated Mn atom (CoN<sub>2</sub>S-MnN<sub>3</sub>), anchored in N-doped carbon. Atomic structural investigations and density functional theory calculations demonstrate that CoN<sub>2</sub>S-MnN<sub>3</sub> experiences spontaneous OH binding to form CoN<sub>2</sub>S-MnN<sub>3</sub>-2OH as the real active site. The strong interaction between the Co-Mn diatomic and the orbital multielectron filling effect induced by the asymmetric charge distribution optimizes the adsorption energy of the reaction intermediates. Therefore, the CoMn-NSC catalyst exhibits competitive ORR activity with a high half-wave potential of 0.901 V, outperforming most of the reported Co-based catalysts so far. The assembled Zn-air battery has ultralong lifespans of up to 1000 h. This work provides an effective strategy for designing new high-efficiency oxygen electrocatalysts.

fuel cells.[1] Pt-based catalysts are conventionally used to drive the ORR reaction at the cathode. However, costs and the exiguity of Pt-based catalysts limited their widespread applications.[2] Consequently, developing non-noble metal catalysts with low cost and high catalytic efficiency. Singleatom catalysts (SACs) have received considerable attention due to the fully exposed active sites, remarkable catalytic activity, and 100% atom utilization efficiency.[3] Among these catalysts, after excluding Fe-NC SACs whose performance is constrained by Fenton reactions, the Co-NC catalysts have long been regarded as the most catalytically active materials under investigation.[3] Compared to SACs, dual-atomic catalysts (DACs) with binuclear metal active sites have higher inherent activity.[4] Building metal diatomic sites on carbon substrates can regulate the electronic effects of materials and optimize the coupling between the orbitals.[5-9] Until now, a series of symmetric diatomic sites have been developed to increase ORR activity, such as FeN<sub>4</sub>—CoN<sub>4</sub>, FeN<sub>4</sub>—MnN<sub>4</sub>, CoN<sub>4</sub>—MnN<sub>4</sub>, etc.[10-12] Owing to the minimal reactivity

between Mn<sup>2+</sup> ions and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, coupled with Mn's catalytic role in forming an ordered graphitic carbon matrix, Mn emerges as a promising candidate to serve as the secondary metal center.<sup>[12]</sup> However, transition metal (TM)<sub>1</sub>N<sub>3</sub>—TM<sub>2</sub>N<sub>3</sub> structures with symmetric charge distributions exhibit weak adsorption energies of ORR-relevant intermediates, leading to restricted reaction speed.[13] Recently, the methods for regulating the coordinated atoms' type and the chemical environment (e.g., TM-N<sub>2</sub>C<sub>2</sub>, TM-N<sub>3</sub>B, TM-N<sub>3</sub>S, TM-N<sub>x</sub>O<sub>y</sub>, etc.) can disrupt the electron/geometric symmetry of the TM-N<sub>4</sub>. [14,15] These approaches can cause asymmetric charge distribution at the active site and regulate the d-band center, further optimizing binding energies for intermediates.<sup>[16-21]</sup> Therefore, catalysts with asymmetric diatomic sites may have greater application prospects because they optimize the coupling between orbitals through diatomic interactions and break the symmetric charge distribution to optimize the binding energy. However, the precise regulation of asymmetric diatomic sites and a deep understanding of their electronic regulation effect are still challenging.

Herein, we synthesized the CoMn-NSC catalyst through an adsorption-pyrolysis method. The structure of the

catalyst emerged as an asymmetric diatomic, where the Mn atom adjacent to the Co atom coordinated with N and S atoms ( $CoN_2S-MnN_3$ ). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the  $CoN_2S-MnN_3$  allows spontaneous OH binding to form  $CoN_2S-MnN_3-2OH$  with asymmetric charge distribution, generating a multiple electron-filled mode and optimizing the  $O_2$  adsorption energy. The as-synthesized asymmetric charge distribution diatomic CoMn-NSC catalyst exhibits an extraordinary ORR performance, outperforming catalysts with monometallic atomic (Mn or Co), symmetric diatomic CoMn-NC catalyst, and the commercial 20% Pt/C.

#### 2. Results and Discussion

**Figure 1a** depicts the synthesis process of the asymmetrically coordinated CoMn—NSC diatomic catalyst. Because Mn(acac)<sub>3</sub> and 2-methyl imidazole (2-MeIm) do not react, the Mn(acac)<sub>3</sub> should be accommodated into the Co—S—zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) cavities.<sup>[22]</sup> Compared with Co—S—ZIF, the X-

ray diffraction (XRD) peaks of CoMn—S—ZIF negatively shift (Figure S1, Supporting Information) due to the lattice expansion according to the Bragg equation. This also verifies the effective integration of the Mn(acac)3. When the ZIF structure decomposes at high temperature, a large number of active S species are released. These S are more likely to "first" combine with Co and be fixed in the carbon skeleton; most of the Mn atoms remain in the original N coordination environment or deeper pore positions. To form Mn—S, a longer diffusion and additional nucleation process are required, and the experiment did not observe sufficient driving force to complete this path; at the same time, the large number of micropores/mesopores generated after the decomposition of ZIF is beneficial to the stability of Co—S, while Mn—S is unstable and difficult to retain on a large scale.

To investigate the influence of various reagents on morphologies of the resulting products, NSC, Mn—NC, Co—NSC, CoMn—NC, and CoMn—NSC samples were synthesized using a similar synthetic method. Figures S2–S4 (Supporting

Information) show the morphology of the corresponding precursor MOFs. The colors of the precursor MOFs are different due to the introduction of various metals, however, there is no significant difference in their micromorphology. Figure S5 (Supporting Information) displays the scanning electron microscope images of the samples subjected to calcination at 1000 °C. All samples maintain a regular dodecahedral structure. There are no significant metal aggregates in the CoMn—NSC sample, in the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of Figure 1b and Figure S6 (Supporting Information). XRD patterns in (Figure S7, Supporting Information) show two broad peaks at 24° and 44°, which correspond to the (002) and (101) planes of graphitic carbon, respectively.

Figure 1c shows the aberration-corrected high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) image of CoMn-NSC. The image reveals a typical rhombic dodecahedral morphology. No apparent nanoparticle is observed, suggesting the generation of atomically distributed CoMnN<sub>x</sub>S<sub>x</sub>. The HAADF-STEM image with high resolution in Figure 1d also confirms the absence of nanoparticles, further illustrating that Co and Mn exist in atomic dispersion form. The diatomic configurations (highlighted by the blue ellipse) with an interatomic distance of  $A_1$  and  $A_2$  of  $\approx 2.39$  Å can be discovered (Figure 1e). In addition, the electron energy-loss spectrum of the paired bright spots in the highlighted area of the inset of the HAADF-STEM image of CoMn—NSC shown in Figure S7b,c (Supporting Information) confirmed the formation of Co-Mn diatomic and N. Furthermore, the corresponding energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) images demonstrate the homogeneous existence of C, N, Co, Mn, and S (Figure 1f). Quantitative analysis conducted via inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry reveals low contents of Co, Mn, and S, amounting to 0.53, 0.50, and 0.47 wt%, respectively (Table S1, Supporting Information). N<sub>2</sub> adsorption-desorption curves (Figure S8, Supporting Information) show that the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface areas of NSC, Mn-NC, Co-NSC, CoMn-NC, and CoMn-NSC are 660.1, 503.8, 778.2, 804.7, and 782.0  $m^2$   $g^{-1}$ , respectively. The average pore width of CoMn-NSC is larger than that of other samples, reaching about 14 nm. High specific surface area and suitable average hole width can provide more active sites.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectrum of the CoMn—NSC, illustrated in Figure S9a (Supporting Information), validates the presence of Co, Mn, N, S, C, and O elements. Table S2 (Supporting Information) lists the metal contents of the samples as determined from XPS. Deconvolution of N 1s spectra (Figure S9b, Supporting Information) shows four distinct N species across all samples: oxidized N (403.1 eV), graphitic N (401.0 eV), pyrrolic N (400.2 eV), and pyridinic N (398.3 eV). Notably, following the addition of Co and Mn metals, a peak emerges at 398.7 eV relevant to the Mn—N or Co—N. The percentage of several N species reveals that both CoMn—NSC and CoMn—NC samples exhibit a higher proportion of metal—N species, comprising 21.8% and 22.5%, respectively, alongside abundant pyridinic N, which is advantageous for the ORR reaction process (Table S3, Supporting Information). [24,25]

Furthermore, the CoMn—NSC and CoMn—NC samples have higher graphitic N proportions than the Co—NSC sample. This can be attributed to the formation of more ordered graphitic carbon due to the introduction of Mn, further improving the stability.<sup>[12d]</sup> This conclusion is also supported by C 1s survey spectra and Raman spectra (Figures S9d, S10, Supporting Information). CoMn—NSC sample has the highest sp<sup>2</sup> C—C/ sp<sup>3</sup> C—C (4.73) and the lowest of  $I_{\rm D}/I_{\rm G}$  (0.98), indicating the highest level of graphitization and conductivity.<sup>[26]</sup> Mn 2p and Co 2p survey spectra demonstrate that metals exhibit an oxidation state, further verifying the presence of Co—N and Mn—N (Figure S9e,f, Supporting Information).

To further probe the coordination environments of Co and Mn sites, X-ray absorption spectroscopy analyses at the Mn Kedge and Co K-edge were performed. The X-ray absorption nearedge structure (XANES) spectra (Figure 2a) reveal that the absorption edge of the Co K-edge XANES profile (pink line) is close to the CoO, suggesting an oxidation state of Co close to +2.[27] The Fourier-transformed (FT) extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectrum of CoMn-NSC (Figure 2b) exhibits a distinct peak at  $\approx 1.6$  Å in R space. First, in the S 2p highresolution spectrum (Figure S9c, Supporting Information), the peak at about 163.7 eV can be attributed to the metal-sulfur coordination, which supports the coordination of S with Co. Second, the Co 2p spectrum (Figure S9f, Supporting Information) shows that Co  $2p_{3/2}$  and  $2p_{1/2}$  are  $\approx$ 781.0 and 796.5 eV, respectively, and are consistent with the supporting satellite peaks, indicating that Co is mainly coordinated by N/S in the form of Co(II). Furthermore, the Co−N peak is located at ≈1.5 Å, and there exists S according to XPS spectra (Figure S9c, Supporting Information), it is deduced that the peak at  $\approx$ 1.6 Å should be attributed to the synergistic effect of the Co-N bond and the Co-S bond. Additionally, a small peak related to the Co−Mn at ≈2.12 Å is observed. FT-EXAFS spectrum corresponded for Co-N, Co-S, and Co-Mn (Figure 2c and Table S4 (Supporting Information)), confirming the coexistence of these species in CoMn-NSC. In the Mn 2p spectrum (Figure S9e, Supporting Information), the Mn 2p<sub>3/2</sub> peak is about 641.3 eV, between +2 and +3. This shows that Co exists in the +2 oxidation state (CoN<sub>2</sub>S), while Mn is mainly in the +2/+3 oxidation state (MnN<sub>3</sub>), which is consistent with the asymmetric coordination result. The coordination number for Co-N in CoMn–NSC is 2.38 ( $\approx$ 2, Table S4, Supporting Information). [28] The Co-Mn peak is smaller for CoMn-NSC than that of Co foil, and the Co-Mn coordination number for CoMn-NSC is 0.81  $(\approx 1, \text{ Table S4}, \text{ Supporting Information})$ , suggesting the absence of structural periodicity. <sup>[29]</sup> The fitting results in k and R space are depicted in Figure 2c and Figures S11, S12 (Supporting Information). Co and Mn K-edge EXAFS oscillations of the materials were intuitively investigated using wavelet transform (WT) analysis. The WT plot of the Co K-edge EXAFS spectrum (Figure 2d–g) reveals an intensity maximum at 5.9 Å<sup>-1</sup> for the Co–Mn bond, representing a negative shift compared to Co foil (8.12  $Å^{-1}$ ), demonstrating that Co exists as a single atom rather than the crystalline Co nanoparticles.

As shown in Figure 2h, the Mn XANES edge of the CoMn—NSC catalyst is between Mn foil and MnO, suggesting that the average valence state varies from 0 to +2. The FT-EXAFS of CoMn—NSC (Figure 2i) indicates two peaks at 1.37 and 2.24 Å, which are close to the Mn—N and Mn—Co peaks, respectively. The FT-EXAFS spectrum is well-fitted for Mn—N and Mn—Co (Figure 2j and Table S2 (Supporting Information)), revealing the existence of Mn—N and Mn—Co. This is consistent with the distance between the two atoms obtained in the HAADF-STEM

image (Figure 1d,e). Notably, the absence of a peak at  $\approx 2.4$  Å excludes the existence of the Mn—Mn bond. Figure 2k—n depicts that CoMn—NSC exhibits an intensity maximum at  $\approx 6$  Å<sup>-1</sup>, which corresponds to the Mn—N bond. Furthermore, a weak peak of  $\approx 6.9$  Å<sup>-1</sup>, which differs from Mn—Mn corresponding to  $\approx 10$  Å<sup>-1</sup>, is observed in the CoMn—NSC, indicating the presence of the weak interaction between the Mn and Co atoms. [30] The IFEF-FIT was used in the following least squares EXAFS fits to validate the coordination conditions of the bimetallic atoms. [31] All fittings are appropriate for the experimental data (Figures S11–S14, Supporting Information). Tables S4 and S5 (Supporting Information) show that the coordination numbers of Co—N, Co—S,

Co—Mn, Mn—N, and Mn—Co are around 2.38, 0.78, 0.81, 3.12, and 1.40, respectively. Based on the fitting results, a hypothesized bimetallic CoN<sub>2</sub>S—MnN<sub>3</sub> model is proposed and depicted in the inset of Figure 2c,j.

Based on the above results, S prefers to coordinate with Co during high-temperature pyrolysis, while Mn mainly coordinates with nitrogen. First, from a thermodynamic point of view, the free energy of Co—S is significantly lower than that of Mn—S, which makes it easier for S to form a stable coordination bond with Co. Second, the electronic configuration of Co (3d<sup>7</sup>4s<sup>2</sup>) is more suitable for the lone pair of S electrons, which can achieve stronger d orbital antibonding feedback (back donation), while

Mn (3d<sup>5</sup>4s<sup>2</sup>) is difficult to obtain sufficient coordination field stabilization effect under the same environment, so that Mn-S does not have thermodynamic and kinetic advantages. Finally, the microporous/mesoporous structure during ZIF-derived pyrolysis and the stronger "S affinity" of Co also amplify this difference, causing Mn-S to be suppressed or displaced during competitive adsorption or nucleation. Taken together, these factors jointly lead to the observation in this study that only Co forms asymmetric coordination with S (CoN<sub>2</sub>S-MnN<sub>3</sub>), while the coordination of Mn with S is excluded, thus presenting efficient diatomic synergistic activity in the oxygen reduction

To assess the impact of asymmetric Co-Mn diatomic sites on catalytic activity, the ORR performances were assessed using the rotating disk electrode (RDE) and the rotating ringdisk electrode (RRDE). Given the relatively modest activity in acidic conditions (Figure \$15, Supporting Information), all performance assessments were conducted in a 0.1  $\,\mathrm{m}$  KOH solution. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves obtained in an O<sub>2</sub>-saturated 0.1 м KOH solution are presented in Figure \$16 (Supporting Information). Cathodic peaks indicate their reactivity toward the ORR. The CoMn—NSC sample exhibits the most positive potential, indicating superior electrocatalytic performances. As shown in Figures 3a and S17 (Supporting Information), similar catalytic trends are also seen in the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves for these samples.

In addition, the CoMn-NSC sample delivers the highest kinetic current density  $(J_k)$  at various potentials. Especially, under the potential of 0.85 V (Figure 3b), the CoMn-NSC sample has the  $J_{\rm k}$  of 40.3 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, further examining the superior ORR catalytic activity of the asymmetric DAC. The corresponding Tafel slopes are shown in Figure 3c. Among all the

samples, the CoMn-NSC has the smallest Tafel slope (66.98 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>) and the fastest ORR kinetics. To investigate the cooperative effect of the central Co-Mn DACs, some controlled samples, such as Mn-NC, Mn-NSC, Co-NSC, and SNC are compared with the CoMn-NSC sample. Figure 3d and Figure S18 (Supporting Information) show the LSV curves, Figure 3e compares the kinetic current densities, and Figure S19 (Supporting Information) shows the Tafel slopes. According to these results, the CoMn-NSC exhibits the best ORR activity among all the asprepared catalysts, indicating that the Co-Mn diatomic sites in CoMn—NSC DACs are more active than other single-atom sites. In detail, the CoMn-NSC catalyst has the onset potential ( $E_{onset}$ ) of 1.06 V and half-wave potential ( $E_{1/2}$ ) of 0.901 V, which surpasses the atomically dispersed CoMn–NC ( $E_{\rm onset}=1.02$  V,  $E_{1/2}$ = 0.85 V), Co-NSC ( $E_{\text{onset}}$  = 1.04 V,  $E_{1/2}$  = 0.82 V), Mn-NSC  $(E_{\text{onset}} = 1.02 \text{ V}, E_{1/2} = 0.85 \text{ V}), \text{ Mn-NC} (E_{\text{onset}} = 0.98 \text{ V}, E_{1/2} =$ 0.84 V), and NSC ( $E_{\text{onset}} = 0.95 \text{ V}$ ,  $E_{1/2} = 0.81 \text{ V}$ ) catalysts. Notably, the CoMn-NSC catalyst also outperforms the commercial Pt/C benchmark ( $E_{\rm onset}=1.02$  V,  $E_{1/2}=0.87$  V) and the majority of single-atom or dual-metal single-atom catalysts that have been reported recently (Figure S20 and Table S6, Supporting Information). Turnover frequency (TOF) is widely acknowledged as a critical parameter for assessing intrinsic activity, particularly in the evaluation of SACs.<sup>[28]</sup> The TOF value of CoMn-NSC is  $34.88~{
m s}^{-1}$  (Figure S21a, Supporting Information), surpassing those of Co–NSC (10.26  $s^{-1}$ ), Mn–NSC (11.30  $s^{-1}$ ), Mn–NC  $(12.45 \text{ s}^{-1})$ , CoMn-NC  $(17.89 \text{ s}^{-1})$ , and the Pt/C  $(2.10 \text{ s}^{-1})$ , demonstrating the increased ORR kinetics on asymmetrically diatomic sites. Figure S21b (Supporting Information) shows the catalyst under RDE test conditions: the Nyquist plot shows that the high-frequency semicircle diameter of the CoMn—NSC electrode is significantly smaller than that of the CoMn-NC, indicating that its charge transfer resistance ( $R_{ct}$ ) is lower. Specifically, the  $R_{ct}$  of CoMn-NSC is about 50% lower than that of CoMn-NC, indicating that the catalyst has better interfacial electron transfer performance.

As illustrated in Figure 3f and Figure S22 (Supporting Information), the CoMn-NSC catalyst exhibits the lowest H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> yield and the highest electron transfer number (n), demonstrating the predominant four-electron transfer. The long-term stability and durability are crucial for assessing ORR performance. In Figure 3g, the CoMn—NSC catalyst demonstrates exceptional durability with negligible decay of  $E_{1/2}$  after 5000 continuous CV cycles. Moreover, chronoamperometric tests (Figure 3h) further confirm the excellent stability of CoMn-NSC. Although the current density briefly decreases before rising above its initial level in the early stages of the reaction (0-2 h), this transient feature is commonly associated with electrode surface "activation" improved wetting of the catalyst layer, and the gradual redistribution of adsorbed species. After 40 h of reaction, the CoMn-NSC catalyst retains 99.8% of the initial current density, while only 59.2% is preserved for the commercial Pt/C. Additionally, the atomically dispersed CoMn-NSC sample maintains its structural robustness well after the stability tests, indicating outstanding stability (Figure S23, Supporting

DFT calculations were performed to comprehend the electrocatalytic process of the CoMn—NSC ( $CoN_2S$ — $MnN_3$ /C). Based on the fitting processes, two probable structures of  $CoN_2S$ — $MnN_3$  models (denoted as t- $CoN_2S$ — $MnN_3$ ) were

constructed (Figure S24a,b, Supporting Information). Then, the structures of CoN<sub>3</sub>-MnN<sub>3</sub>, CoN<sub>3</sub>S, and MnN<sub>4</sub> were also modeled (Figures S25, S26a,b, Supporting Information). Because the free energy of models was calculated, the limiting potential of MnN<sub>4</sub> (0.33 V) is significantly lower than the experimental (0.84 V), implying that the model requires further optimization.<sup>[22]</sup> The ORR reaction activities were reported to improve further after attaching hydroxyl ligands (\*OH).[13,32] Free energy changes on CoN<sub>3</sub>S-OH and MnN<sub>4</sub>-OH are subsequently calculated (Figures S27a,b, S28a,b and Table S7, Supporting Information). The as-calculated limiting potentials for the CoN<sub>3</sub>S-OH and MnN<sub>4</sub>-OH models are 0.63 and 0.59 V, respectively. These results are close to the real experimental result, demonstrating the justifiability of using OH-adsorbed models. The calculations on CoN<sub>3</sub>-MnN<sub>3</sub> models (symmetric CoMn-NC catalyst) absorbed with different OH ligands (Figure \$29-\$31 and Table S8, Supporting Information), the CoN<sub>3</sub>-MnN<sub>3</sub> model absorbed with two OH ligands, represented the CoN3-MnN3-2OH-2-a (Figure \$30 and Table \$8, Supporting Information), illustrates the 0.85 V limiting potential, which is consistent with the experimental data for the symmetric bimetallic CoMn-NC catalyst. Then, after a series of calculations on the t-CoN<sub>2</sub>S-MnN<sub>3</sub> and i-CoN2S-MnN3 models absorbed with different OH ligands (Figures S32-S37 and Tables S9 and S10, Supporting Information), the t-CoN<sub>2</sub>S-MnN<sub>3</sub> model has absorbed with two OH ligands, represented the t-CoN<sub>2</sub>S-MnN<sub>3</sub>-2OH-2-b (Table \$10, Supporting Information) and CoN<sub>2</sub>S-MnN<sub>3</sub>-2OH (Figure 4a), illustrates the highest limiting potential of 0.89 V. The mechanisms of ORR on the CoN2S-MnN3-2OH are described in Figure 4b. As shown in Figure 4b, there is a synergistic effect between the bimetallic atoms of Co and Mn. The Co atoms are the main active sites and the Mn atoms are the auxiliary catalytic sites. The partial density of states (PDOS) of CoN2S-MnN3-2OH for the Co and Mn metal sites show a high overlap (Figure S38, Supporting Information), suggesting the interaction between the bimetallic sites, which could greatly improve the reaction activity. The mechanisms of ORR on the single-atom active sites CoN<sub>3</sub>S-OH and MnN<sub>4</sub>-OH are described in Figure \$39 (Supporting Information). Compared with diatomic active sites, single-atom active sites have only one reacting metal central atom, which is not conducive to the efficient progress of catalytic reactions. As represented in Figure 4c, CoN<sub>2</sub>S-MnN<sub>3</sub>-2OH exhibits the steepest uphill at the first stage, which is named the rate-determining step. Compared with several other catalysts, asymmetric CoN<sub>2</sub>S-MnN<sub>3</sub>-2OH has the lowest overpotential, confirming the high efficiency of its electrocatalytic process. Whereas, the rate-determining step for MnN<sub>4</sub>—OH is the desorption of \*OH, confirming the strong bonding between Mn and

To gain deeper insight into the intrinsic mechanism of enhanced activity of bimetallic sites, the length of the metal—O<sub>2</sub> bond was examined. When O<sub>2</sub> is adsorbed on the asymmetric diatomic sites, the appropriate metal—O<sub>2</sub> bond length reduces the energy barrier. Additionally, the lowest oxygen adsorption energy (–1.18 eV) and the longest O—O bond length (1.395 Å) in the O<sub>2</sub>-adsorbed asymmetric CoN<sub>2</sub>S—MnN<sub>3</sub>—2OH (Figure 4d and Table S11 (Supporting Information)) ensure easier cleavage of the O<sub>2</sub>. Bader charge analysis further verifies the change in the d-band center energy (Table S12, Supporting Information).

As shown in Table \$12 (Supporting Information), Co carries a charge of about +0.91 e, while Mn carries a charge of up to +1.41e. This numerical difference indicates that Mn is more likely to maintain or tend to a higher oxidation state in this system; when it faces sulfur ligands with lower electronegativity (relatively weaker electronegativity than N), it often needs to overcome additional charge transfer barriers or undergo a large electron rearrangement. This further verifies the formation mechanism and sulfur coordination preference of the CoN<sub>2</sub>S-MnN<sub>3</sub> structure. The variance between Bader charge values and asymmetric charge distribution in CoN2S-MnN3-2OH leads to orbit rearrangement and electron redistribution (as shown in Figure 4e,f). Through further DFT simulation calculations, if Co is coordinated with sulfur, the system free energy ( $\Delta G$ ) is often relatively positive (-1.8 eV), and if Mn is coordinated with sulfur, the  $\Delta G$  is often relatively positive (-0.24 eV). It is easy to see that

S is more easily combined with Co, and Mn—S is more difficult to occur spontaneously thermodynamically than Co-S.

Based on the density of states of Co d-orbitals in the models of CoN<sub>2</sub>S-MnN<sub>3</sub>-2OH, CoN<sub>3</sub>-MnN<sub>3</sub>-2OH, and CoN<sub>3</sub>S-2OH (Figure 5a,b), the d-band center of CoN<sub>2</sub>S-MnN<sub>3</sub>-2OH is closer to the Fermi level and it has high O<sub>2</sub> adsorption energy (Figure 5c). The Co d-orbitals are primarily responsible for O<sub>2</sub> adsorption. Notably, the presence of Mn in the CoN<sub>2</sub>S-MnN<sub>3</sub> structure does not directly facilitate the cleavage of the O-O bond. Instead, Mn modulates the local electronic environment by shifting the Co d-band center closer to the Fermi level. This electronic modulation enhances the back donation from Co to the antibonding orbitals of O2, thereby strengthening the adsorption and lowering the activation barrier for the ORR. The PDOS analysis (see Figure 5a,c) demonstrates this shift, underscoring that Mn acts as an electronic promoter rather than a direct catalytic center for O—O bond cleavage. This synergistic effect is essential for achieving the high ORR performance

observed with the CoN<sub>2</sub>S-MnN<sub>3</sub> catalyst. As shown in Table \$10 (Supporting Information), the O<sub>2</sub> adsorption energy of the symmetrical CoN<sub>3</sub>-MnN<sub>3</sub>-2OH model is -0.32 eV. The simulation results and the E in the actual experiment are both around 0.85 V, indicating that the adsorption of O<sub>2</sub> is weak. The O<sub>2</sub> adsorption energy of the asymmetric CoN<sub>2</sub>S-MnN<sub>3</sub>-2OH is -1.18 eV. The upward shift of the d-band center also shows that the increase in O2 adsorption energy is beneficial to the adsorption of O2. The result indicates that the antibonding orbitals of Co in CoN2S-MnN3-2OH should have more electrons, [33] which would facilitate the adsorption of the reactants on the catalyst surface. Moreover, the heightened d-band center energy compared to CoN<sub>3</sub>S-OH (-1.23 eV) implies CoN<sub>2</sub>S-MnN<sub>3</sub>-2OH would exhibit optimal adsorption energy toward the ORR intermediates. As shown in Figure 5d,e, the CoN<sub>2</sub>S-MnN<sub>3</sub>-2OH configuration exhibits a larger overlap area between the active site and O2 molecular orbitals, which directly correlates with stronger O2 adsorption. This enhanced

adsorption is attributed to the increased hybridization between the d-orbitals of Co and Mn and the antibonding  $\pi$  orbitals of O<sub>2</sub>, facilitating electron transfer and optimizing the binding energy of ORR intermediates. According to the d-band center theory, such orbital hybridization effectively lowers the O<sub>2</sub> activation barrier, thereby improving catalytic efficiency. These results confirm that the CoN<sub>2</sub>S—MnN<sub>3</sub>—2OH active site exhibits a well-balanced adsorption strength, ensuring efficient oxygen reduction kinetics.

Figures 6a,b and S40a,b (Supporting Information) show in situ Raman spectra of the CoMn-NSC, CoMn-NC, Co-NSC, and Mn-NC, which were obtained in 0.1 M KOH at different potentials. As the potential shifted from 0 to 1.2 V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE), a broad peak around 1155 cm<sup>-1</sup> gradually appeared, which should be attributed to the superoxide O—O stretching peak, [33,34] indicating the initial single electron transfer step in the electroreduction of O<sub>2</sub> to O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>. Figure 6c illustrates that CoMn-NSC exhibits four main absorption peaks around 3000-3550, 1638, 1240, and 1050 cm<sup>-1</sup> during the ORR process. The peak in the range of 3000–3550 cm<sup>-1</sup> corresponds to the OH stretching bond. [35,36] The HOH stretching bond at 1638 cm<sup>-1</sup> is evident, suggesting that water molecules would bind to the \*OOH and \*O2<sup>-</sup> intermediates on the catalyst surface. These observations further confirm the efficient ORR process, consistent with theoretical calculations. Furthermore, the O-O stretching vibration at 1240 cm<sup>-1</sup> from the reactive oxygen intermediate on the surface of the CoMn-NSC catalyst becomes more pronounced as the potentials decrease, demonstrating the dynamic coupling of oxygen species on the catalyst surface.[37] In situ, attenuated total reflection surface-enhanced

infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR-SEIRAS) of CoMn—NC, Co—NSC, and Mn—NC catalysts also revealed two weak peaks of  $O_2^-$  at 1050 cm<sup>-1</sup> and \*OOH at 1240 cm<sup>-1</sup>, respectively (Figure 6d and Figure S40c,d (Supporting Information)). As reported, during the ORR process, the selectivity for the electroreduction of  $O_2$  to  $H_2O_2$  (via the two-electron reaction pathway) or  $H_2O$  (via the four-electron reaction pathway) is largely determined by its propensity to break the O—O bond. The strong binding of \*OOH intermediates on the catalyst surface favors the four-electron pathway over the two-electron pathway, resulting in the reduction and dissociation of \*OOH intermediates into \*O and \*OH intermediates, facilitating the electroreduction of  $O_2$  to  $H_2O_2^{[38,39]}$ 

The Zn-air battery was assembled using the CoMn-NSC as the cathode (Figure 7a). Figure 7b illustrates that the CoMn-NSC-based Zn-air battery maintains a steady open circuit voltage (OCV) of 1.56 V for up to 27 h. The ladder-shaped discharge curves (Figure 7c) exhibit swift responses and offer steady voltages within 10-50 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. Upon returning to 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, CoMn-NSC shows a negligible voltage drop, indicating good voltage recoverability. The maximum power density of 152.2 mW cm<sup>-2</sup> could be reached from the CoMn-NSC-based Zn-air battery (Figure 7d), surpassing some reported zinc-air batteries (Figure 7e and Table S14 (Supporting Information)). The CoMn-NSC-based Zn-air battery shows outstanding stability (Figure 7f), with no significant potential loss observed within 40 h. Moreover, the single battery based on the CoMn-NSC catalyst with a working voltage of 1.56 V can power a diode screen (inset in Figure 7f). Cycling stability for both discharge and charge processes can be observed over 1000 h for the

CoMn-NSC-based ZAB. The discharge voltage of Pt/C-based ZAB (Figure 7g) exhibits instability at around 200 h, confirming the outstanding stability of CoMn-NSC in practical ZABs. Figure 7h demonstrates negligible changes in the voltage efficiency over 1000 h. The CoMn-NSC-catalyst-based Zn-air battery delivers a peak power density of 152 mW cm<sup>-2</sup>, which is competitive with many state-of-the-art nonprecious metal catalysts (Table S14, Supporting Information). While some reports have demonstrated higher power densities, our CoMn—NSC catalyst exhibits exceptional long-term cycling stability, maintaining a stable voltage profile for over 1000 h, surpassing most reported catalysts that degrade within 500 cycles. Furthermore, the catalyst achieves a discharge voltage of 1.25 V at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, positioning it among the most efficient ORR catalysts for Zn–air batteries. These results highlight the superior durability and energy efficiency of CoMn—NSC, making it a strong candidate for practical energy storage applications.

#### 3. Conclusions

In summary, a novel asymmetric charge-distributed Co-Mn diatomic catalyst was prepared using an adsorption-pyrolysis method. In the catalyst, the sulfur and nitrogen-coordinated Co atom adjacent nitrogen-coordinated Mn atoms (CoN<sub>2</sub>S-MnN<sub>3</sub>) are anchored in N-doped carbon. The CoN<sub>2</sub>S-MnN<sub>3</sub> experiences spontaneous OH binding to form the CoN2S-MnN3-2OH with asymmetric charge distribution, which leads to the multiple electron-filled states in the orbital. Owing to the strong interactions among the Co-Mn diatomic, and the multielectron-filled states due to asymmetric charge distribution, the CoN<sub>2</sub>S-MnN<sub>3</sub>-2OH active site shows the optimal O<sub>2</sub> adsorption energy toward the ORR intermediates. Consequently, the asprepared CoMn-NSC exhibits excellent ORR activity with a high half-wave potential of 0.901 V, surpassing a commercial Pt/C catalyst and outperforming the most reported Co-based catalysts. The assembled Zn-air battery with CoMn-NSC catalyst has high power density of 152.2 mW cm<sup>-2</sup> and ultralong lifespans of up to 1000 h, largely outperforming the noble-metal-based Pt/C benchmark. These results provide a new strategy for the synergistically electronic modulation of asymmetric charge distribution and diatomic sites during the ORR process and may inspire the rational design of high-efficiency oxygen electrocatalysts.

## 4. Experimental Section

Synthesis of CoMn-NSC Catalysts: In a typical synthesis, 104 mg of  $Co(NO_3)_2 \cdot 6H_2O$ , 856 mg of  $Zn(NO_3)_2 \cdot 6H_2O$ , 101.5 mg of  $H_2NCSNH_2$ , 252 mg of Mn(acac)<sub>3</sub> were dissolved in 50 mL of methanol by stirring. Then, 50 mL of methanol containing 2.35 g of 2-MeIm was slowly dropped by drop and added under vigorous stirring for 24 h at room temperature. The obtained product was separated by centrifugation, washed with ethanol, and finally dried at 60 °C under a vacuum oven overnight. For convenience, the precursors were designated as CoMn-ZIF. The powder of CoMn-ZIF was transferred into a ceramic boat and then heated up to 1000 °C with a ramp rate of 5 °C min<sup>-1</sup> and maintained for 2 h under the flowing 95% Ar/5% H<sub>2</sub> atmosphere, generating the CoMn—NSC sample.

Synthesis of CoMn—NC Catalysts: The synthetic procedure was similar to that of the CoMn—NSC catalyst except without adding H<sub>2</sub>NCSNH<sub>2</sub>.

Synthesis of Mn-NC: The synthetic procedure was similar to that of the CoMn-NC catalyst except without adding Co(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>·6H<sub>2</sub>O and H2NCSNH2.

Synthesis of Mn-NSC: The synthetic procedure was similar to that of the CoMn–NC catalyst except without adding  $Co(NO_3)_2 \cdot 6H_2O$ .

Synthesis of Co-NSC: Synthesized by a similar method for preparing CoMn-NSC except without adding Mn(acac)<sub>3</sub> and newly added H<sub>2</sub>NCSNH<sub>2</sub> which provided a S source.

Synthesis of SNC: The SNC sample was obtained by annealing ZIF-8 precursor at 1000 °C for 2 h under the flowing 95% Ar/5% H<sub>2</sub> atmosphere and newly added H2NCSNH2 that provided a S source.

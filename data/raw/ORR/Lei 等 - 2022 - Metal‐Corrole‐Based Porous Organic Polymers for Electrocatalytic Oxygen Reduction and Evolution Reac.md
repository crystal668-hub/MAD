Abstract: Integrating molecular catalysts into designed frameworks often enables improved catalysis. Compared with porphyrin-based frameworks, metal-corrole-based frameworks have been rarely developed, although monomeric metal corroles are usually more efficient than porphyrin counterparts for the electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). We herein report on metal-corrolebased porous organic polymers (POPs) as ORR and OER electrocatalysts. M-POPs (M=Mn, Fe, Co, Cu) were synthesized by coupling metal 10-phenyl-5,15-(4iodophenyl)corrole with tetrakis(4ethynylphenyl)methane. Compared with metal corrole monomers, M-POPs displayed significantly enhanced catalytic activity and stability. Co-POP outperformed other M-POPs by achieving four-electron ORR with a half-wave potential of 0.87 V vs. RHE and reaching 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> OER current density at 340 mV overpotential. This work is unparalleled to develop and explore metal-corrole-based POPs as electrocatalysts.

Electrocatalytic ORR and OER are the half reaction in fuel cells and water splitting, respectively.<sup>[1-5]</sup> Their efficiency is one key towards the high efficiency of H<sub>2</sub> generation and utilization.<sup>[6-10]</sup> Therefore, the viability of a hydrogen society also depends on developing efficient ORR and OER electrocatalysts.<sup>[4,11-14]</sup> In addition, rechargeable metal-air batteries require bifunctional electrocatalysts for ORR and OER.<sup>[12,15,16]</sup> Although molecular catalysts have benefits to study reaction mechanisms<sup>[13,17]</sup> and structure-function relationships,<sup>[18,19]</sup> their activity and stability have to be

improved for practical applications.<sup>[20-24]</sup> Integrating molecular catalysts into frameworks with porous structures often leads to improved electrocatalytic performance because porous frameworks have large specific surface areas, make easy exposure of active sites to substrates, and allow fast mass transfers.<sup>[15,25-33]</sup> More importantly, the periodic network structures enable active sites with molecular properties to be uniformly distributed.<sup>[25,27,31,34-36]</sup> Thus, knowledge learned from molecular catalysis can be used for the design of molecule-based framework catalysts, whose active site structures can be rationally and systematically modified.<sup>[35-41]</sup>

Metal porphyrins are efficient electrocatalysts for ORR and OER. [5,42-46] Porphyrin-based frameworks usually display boosted activity and stability compared with respective monomers. [35,47-52] Like porphyrins, corroles provide metal ions with four-coordinated square-planar M-N<sub>4</sub> structure. Importantly, the trianionic corrole macrocycles are more effective than dianionic porphyrin ligands to stabilize highvalent metal ions,[53] which are intermediates involved in both ORR and OER.[11,16,19,54-58] Thus, metal corroles in general show better performance than porphyrin counterparts for electrocatalytic ORR and OER. [5,18] However, compared with porphyrins, corroles lack one meso-carbon atom and thus have relatively lower symmetry, which makes the design and synthesis of corrole-based frameworks more challenging. As a result, few metal-corrole-based frameworks have been synthesized and examined as ORR and/or OER electrocatalysts. [59-64]

Herein, we reported the synthesis and electrocatalytic feature of a class of metal-corrole-based POPs. These M-POPs (M=Mn, Fe, Co, and Cu) are more active and durable than metal corrole monomers for electrocatalytic ORR and OER. Importantly, Co-POP showed the highest activity for both ORR and OER in this series of catalysts. As high efficiency for both ORR and OER has been rarely achieved with porphyrin-based frameworks, [12,47] this result demonstrated the appealing features of metal-corrole-based frameworks in electrocatalysis. Moreover, a Zn-air battery assembled with Co-POP showed better performance than battery made with Pt/Ir-based materials. This work is thus significant to present unparalleled examples of metalcorrole-based POPs as efficient ORR and OER electrocatalysts and to show the benefits of exploring moleculebased framework catalysts by systemically tuning the active

purity of these metal corroles were verified (Figure S1–S9). Importantly, the free-base corrole (Figure S4a) and its Co complex (namely Co corrole, Figure S6a) were structurally characterized. In both structures, the two 4-iodophenyl substituents, which are the reaction sites with tetrakis(4 ethynylphenyl)methane (TEPM), are identified at the 5 position and 15-position of the corrole macrocycle. In the structure of Co corrole, the Co ion was located at the center of the corrole ligand with four Co N bonds. Two pyridines were bound on the two axial sites of Co. The CoIII oxidation state was suggested from the X-ray structure.

The Sonogashira coupling between metal corroles and TEPM gave **M-POPs** (Figure 1a). **Co-POP** has a Brunauer– Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area of 304 m<sup>2</sup> g <sup>1</sup> (Figure S10a), confirming its porous structure.[31, 34] Similar BET surface areas were obtained for other M-POPs (Figure S10b–d). As shown in Figure 1b, the infrared spectrum of Co corrole displayed a band at 461 cm <sup>1</sup> due to the stretching vibration of C I bonds.[62] TEPM exhibited two bands at 3284 and 2104 cm <sup>1</sup> due to C�C H and C�C bonds, respectively.[51] In the infrared spectrum of **Co-POP**, these three bands disappeared, indicating the coupling between TEPM and Co corrole. Note that the C�C band decreased in intensity upon coupling to form pseudo-symmetrical Ar C�C Ar structures. The infrared studies of the other three **M-POPs** also confirmed the polymerization (Figure S11). The formation of **Co-POP** was also suggested by solid-state 13C cross-polarization magic-angle spinning (CP/ MAS) NMR spectroscopy. As shown in Figure 1c, **Co-POP** exhibited multiple broad signals. The signals at 66 and 147 ppm are due to the TEPM moiety, while signals in the 120–140 ppm range are attributed to the overlap of signals from both TEPM and Co corrole moieties.[63] After the polymerization, TEPM signals at 65 and 146 ppm became much broadened, and its two C�C signals at 79 and 83 ppm became a very broad band peaked at 91 ppm. These results confirmed the successful coupling. Moreover, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis of **Co-POP** showed that Co 2p and N 1s signals are identical to those of Co corrole (Figure S12), suggesting the maintenance of the Co corrole core structure in the resulted POP structure. Importantly, the I 3d signals of Co corrole disappeared in **Co-POP**, which is a result strongly supporting the successful and complete polymerization. Similar results were also observed for other **M-POPs** (Figure S13–S15).

The morphology and composition of **Co-POP** were analyzed. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Figure 1d) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Figure 1e) images showed uniform ball-like morphology of **Co-POP**. The high-angle annular dark-field scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM) image of **Co-POP** (Figure 1f) and the corresponding energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) elemental mapping images of C (Figure 1g), N (Figure 1h), and Co (Figure 1i) clearly showed the uniform distribution of Co corrole moieties over the polymer. These results further verified the polymerization. SEM and TEM analysis of the other three **M-POPs** and the metal-free corrole-based POP (defined as **H3-POP**) showed that their morphology and size were similar to those of **Co-POP** (Figure S16 and S17).

Electrocatalytic ORR measurements were performed in 0.1 M KOH solutions. Note that **M-POPs** were mixed with carbon black (CB) for electrocatalytic studies, and all potentials reported are referenced to reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). Our results showed that **Co-POP** displayed the highest activity among these POPs (Figure S18– S21). The linear sweep voltammogram (LSV) of **Co-POP** displayed an ORR current with the half-wave potential *E*1/2=0.87 V (Figure 2a). This performance is close to that of Pt/C (20 wt%, *E*1/2=0.87 V) under the same conditions. By comparing with previously reported framework ORR elec-

trocatalysts (Table S2), the performance of **Co-POP** is also remarkable. Note that blank CB has very poor electrocatalytic ORR activity (Figure S22), and Co corrole directly loaded on CB showed ORR at *E*1/2=0.73 V (Figure 2b). Therefore, **Co-POP** was more active than Co corrole for ORR. The Co content loaded for electrocatalysis was identical for **Co-POP** and Co corrole (Table S3).

To address the activity difference between **Co-POP** and Co corrole, we measured the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA). As shown in Figure S23, the ECSA of **Co-POP** and Co corrole loaded on CB was determined to be 2.11 and 0.70 cm<sup>2</sup> , respectively, showing that **Co-POP** has relatively more exposed active sites for electrocatalysis. Very similar ECSA was obtained for **Mn-POP** (2.18 cm<sup>2</sup> ), **Fe-POP** (2.11 cm<sup>2</sup> ), and **Cu-POP** (2.15 cm<sup>2</sup> ) (Figure S24). The mass transfer ability was estimated by determining the ORR Tafel slopes with rotation speed ω=0 and +∞. With ω= +∞, the kinetic controlled current was obtained by eliminating the mass diffusion limitations.[65] Our results showed that with ω=0 and +∞ (Figure S25 and S26), the ORR Tafel slopes of **Co-POP** were 39 and 37 mVdec <sup>1</sup> , respectively (Figure 2c), while the ORR Tafel slopes of Co corrole were 77 and 52 mVdec <sup>1</sup> , respectively (Figure 2d). Thus, rotation speed has much less influence on the Tafel slope of **Co-POP** compared with Co corrole. Additionally, the ORR Tafel slope of **Co-POP** at ω=0 was smaller than that of Co corrole. These results suggested that during ORR electrocatalysis, more efficient mass transfer was evidenced with **Co-POP**. In addition, the electron transfer rate constant of **Co-POP** (0.85 s 1 ) is larger than that of Co corrole (0.61 s 1 ) (Figure S27). All these factors are suggested to make **Co-POP** more active than Co corrole for electrocatalytic ORR.

Moreover, we determined the electronic structure of **Co-POP** and Co corrole by using UV/Vis absorption spectroscopy and valence band X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (VB-XPS). As shown in Figure S28, the valence band, conduction band, and the band gap of **Co-POP** and Co corrole were similar to each other, indicating that the electronic structure of the Co center in **Co-POP** and Co corrole is similar. The electronic band structures of the other three **M-POPs** and their respective metal corroles were also analyzed, suggesting that the electronic structure of metal center has negligible change upon polymerization (Figure S29–S31). In addition, similar resistance values of **M-POPs** were obtained (*>*3100 GΩcm, Table S4).

Moreover, **Co-POP** displayed significantly improved durability during ORR electrolysis. As shown in Figure S32, the ORR current with **Co-POP** dropped by 5% after 10-h electrolysis at 0.50 V, while the catalytic current with Co corrole dropped by 15%. The after-electrolysis **Co-POP** showed negligible activity loss (Figure S33), and also displayed no changes in XPS analysis (Figure S34).

In addition, by comparing ORR *E*1/2 value, **Co-POP** (0.87 V) was much more active than **Mn-POP** (0.72 V), **Fe-POP** (0.78 V), **Cu-POP** (0.75 V), and **H3-POP** (0.71 V) for ORR electrocatalysis. The ORR Tafel slope of **Co-POP** (39 mVdec <sup>1</sup> ) is smaller than that of **Mn-POP** (100 mVdec <sup>1</sup> ), **Fe-POP** (129 mVdec <sup>1</sup> ), **Cu-POP** (78 mVdec <sup>1</sup> ), **H3-POP** (90 mVdec <sup>1</sup> ), and Pt/C (75 mVdec <sup>1</sup> ) (Figure S35). The number (*n*) of electrons transferred per O2 reduction with **Co-POP** was 3.91 (Figure 3a, b). The *n* values of **Mn-POP** (3.32), **Fe-POP** (3.80) and **Cu-POP** (3.61) were determined (Figure 3c, S36–S38). Smilar ORR selectivity of **M-POPs** was also obtained by analyzing rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) results (Figure S39).

In addition to ORR, **M-POPs** also displayed electrocatalytic OER activity in 0.1 M KOH solutions. For example, **Co-POP** on a glassy carbon (GC) electrode displayed high electrocatalytic OER activity by achieving 10 mAcm <sup>2</sup>

current density at overpotential *η*=340 mV (Figure 4a), while Co corrole required *η*=440 mV to get the same current (Figure S40). Thus, **Co-POP** represents one of the most efficient framework OER electrocatalysts in literature (Table S5). Importantly, **Co-POP** was also more active than

the other **M-POPs** for OER. This high activity of **Co-POP** is consistent with the fact that Co corrole displayed the highest OER activity among all examined metal corrole monomers (Figure S41).

The OER Tafel slope of **Co-POP** was 93 mVdec <sup>1</sup> (Figure 4b), while it was 149 mVdec <sup>1</sup> for **Mn-POP**, 117 mVdec <sup>1</sup> for **Fe-POP**, 157 mVdec <sup>1</sup> for **Cu-POP**, and 169 mVdec <sup>1</sup> for **H3-POP**. The OER stability was also examined. Electrolysis with **Co-POP** at *η*=340 mV gave constant 5.80 mAcm <sup>2</sup> current density in 10 h (Figure 4c). The O2 produced was determined, giving a Faradaic efficiency of *>*98% (Figure 4d). XPS analysis of the afterelectrolysis **Co-POP** suggested the stability of the Co corrole core structure in long-time electrolysis (Figure S42).

To address the potential applications of these **M-POPs**, we assembled a rechargeable Zn–air battery with **Co-POP** because of its high activities for both ORR and OER (Figure 5a). The open circuit voltage of **Co-POP** battery was 1.54 V (Figure 5b), while it was 1.49 V with Pt/Ir-based battery. The specific capacity at 20 mAcm <sup>2</sup> current density was 789.1 mAhg <sup>1</sup> for **Co-POP** battery, whereas it was 761.5 mAhg <sup>1</sup> for Pt/Ir-based battery (Figure 5c). The charge–discharge polarization and corresponding power density showed that **Co-POP** battery has a maximum power density of 207.1 mWcm <sup>2</sup> , which is larger than that of Pt/Irbased battery (145.6 mWcm <sup>2</sup> ) (Figure 5d). **Co-POP** battery showed an initial charge–discharge voltage gap of 0.91 V at 2 mAcm <sup>2</sup> current density, which was smaller than that of Pt/Ir-based battery (0.95 V) (Figure 5e). Moreover, **Co-POP** battery showed great durability in cycling tests (Figure 5f). It is worth noting that the focus of this work is to develop and explore metal-corrole-based POPs as ORR and OER electrocatalysts. Optimizing the performance of Zn–air batteries assembled with **M-POPs** is the ongoing work in our group.

In conclusion, we report on a series of **M-POPs** as bifunctional electrocatalysts for ORR and OER. **M-POPs** are more active and stable than respective metal corrole monomers, and **Co-POP** is the most efficient electrocatalyst in this series. With both ORR and OER activities, Zn–air battery assembled with **Co-POP** exhibited better performance than Pt/Ir-based battery. This work presents unprecedented examples of metal-corrole-based frameworks as electrocatalysts for ORR and OER and highlights the benefits of molecule-based framework catalysts, in which molecular catalytic features can be transferred and kept and molecular structures can be systematically modified.

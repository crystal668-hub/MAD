Identifying the actual structure and tuning the catalytic activity of Fe-N<sub>4</sub>-based moieties, well-recognized high-activity sites in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) are challenging problems. Herein, by using poly(iron phth-alocyanine) (PFePc) as an Fe-N<sub>4</sub>-based model electrocatalyst, a mechanistic insight into the effect of axial ligands on the ORR catalytic activity of Fe-N<sub>4</sub> is provided and it is revealed that the ORR activity of Fe-N<sub>4</sub> sites with OH desorption as a rate-determining step is related to the energy level gap between the OH  $p_x p_y$  and Fe  $3d_{z^2}$ , which can be tuned by regulating the field strength of the axial ligands. Thus, PFePc coordinated with a weak-field ligand I<sup>-</sup> (PFePc-I) with a low energy level of Fe  $3d_{z^2}$  exhibits high activity evidenced by an ORR half-wave potential as high as 0.948 V versus RHE. This work develops a novel strategy for tuning the ORR activity of Fe-N<sub>4</sub> and reveals the correlation between the electronic/geometric structure and catalytic activity of Fe-N<sub>4</sub>.

### 1. Introduction

Controllably tuning the catalytic activity of identified active sites based on adequately understood mechanisms is desired but challenging for the development of precious-metal-free electrocatalysts toward the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). [1–3] Among the already recognized reactive moieties in the non-precious metal-based ORR electrocatalysts, the metal–nitrogen (M-N<sub>x</sub>) based moieties, especially the Fe–N<sub>4</sub>-based moieties, have been reported to possess the highest catalytic activity. [4–7]

Although the planar square  $Fe-N_4$  is considered to be the basic unit of the active  $Fe-N_4$ -based moieties, the exact local structure of such moieties has not yet been determined due to that the axial ligands and the second coordination sphere (i.e., the surrounding carbon matrix) of  $Fe-N_4$  are unclear. [8]

Based on the computational hydrogen electrode (CHE) model, the theoretical ORR onset potentials of Fe–N<sub>4</sub> in different models were as low as 0.25–0.43 V versus RHE ( $V_{\rm RHE}$ ), [9,10] much lower than the experimentally measured ones on Fe–N–C (0.82–0.95 V<sub>RHE</sub>). Besides, some new active moieties in Fe–N–C (e.g., FeON<sub>4</sub>, Fe(OH)N<sub>4</sub>, and FeN<sub>4</sub>Cl) were proposed by using in situ characterizations or CHE modeling, [11–14] revealing that the axialligand coordination played a critical role

in high-activity  $Fe-N_4$ -based moieties. However, these studies were carried out on Fe-N-C that contained not only the  $Fe-N_4$  sites but also a large number of other ORR active sites (such as the N-doped carbon and intrinsic defects of carbon), in which the implemented modifications would affect the ORR activities of different active sites and sometimes even alter the structure of the carbon matrix.  $^{[15]}$  That is, the observed ORR activity improvement of the Fe-N-C after such modifications could not be solely attributed to the enhancement of the intrinsic ORR activity of  $Fe-N_4$  and thus the mechanism associated with the improvement is still ambiguous. To this end, developing a model catalyst as a studying platform is highly demanded to reveal the regulation mechanism of axial-ligand coordination on the catalytic activity of  $Fe-N_4$  sites.

Iron porphyrin (FePr) and iron phthalocyanine (FePc) are widely used molecular model catalysts with Fe–N<sub>4</sub> as the only kind of ORR active sites.  $^{[16]}$  Although some modified FePc and FePr with axially coordinated Fe–N<sub>4</sub> moieties have been reported in recent papers,  $^{[17-19]}$  only a few strong ligands (e.g., CN $^-$  and pyridine) could perform such axial coordination due to that the FePc and FePr are more inclined to exist as the D4h symmetry structure with highly concentrated local electrons.  $^{[17]}$  In order to systematically study the correlation between the axial ligands and the catalytic activity of Fe–N<sub>4</sub> sites, it is necessary to explore a Fe–N<sub>4</sub>-based molecular model catalyst with a stronger axial coordination ability. Poly(phthalocyanine iron) (PFePc) is an alkali-soluble

Fe–N<sub>4</sub>-based polymer with similar active sites and ORR activity as FePc. [20–22] Benefiting from the decreased local electron density of Fe–N<sub>4</sub> due to the conjugated  $\pi$  bond of Pc, PFePc with a strong axial coordination ability shows potential as a suitable model catalyst to study the role of the axial ligands.

In this work, we aim to acquire the mechanistic insight of the axial ligands regulating the ORR catalytic activity of Fe-N<sub>4</sub> at the atomic and molecular levels. To this end, a series of ligands of different field-strengths are selected to axially coordinate with the Fe-N<sub>4</sub> sites in PFePc (PFePc-L, L = axial ligands). The detailed synthesis processes are shown in Figure 1a and Figures S1 and S2 (Supporting Information). Based on the crystal-field theory, the 3d-orbital configuration and electron-spin state of the Fe center in Fe-N<sub>4</sub> could be controllably regulated by coordinating the Fe center with strongfield (ethylenediamine (en) > triethylamine (TEA) > NCS-) and weak-field ligands (OH $^-$  > F $^-$  > Cl $^-$  > Br $^-$  > I $^-$ ) (Table S1, Supporting Information). [23] Experimental characterizations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the axial-ligand coordination not only rearranges the Fe 3d orbital configuration but also lowers the orbital energy level. By analyzing the correlation between the bonding strength of the key ORR intermediates on PFePc-L and the Fe 3d electron/orbital configurations, the influencing mechanism of the axial ligands on the ORR catalytic activity of Fe–N<sub>4</sub> under both alkaline and acidic conditions is successfully elucidated.

### 2. Results and Discussion

First of all, the ORR activity of the as-prepared PFePc-L/C electrodes was evaluated in a 0.1 mol L<sup>-1</sup> KOH electrolyte. According to the LSV study (Figure 1b), the half-wave potential of the ORR ( $E_{1/2}$ ) on the PFePc-L/C electrode positively shifts as the crystal-field strength of the coordinated ligands (L) decreases (Figure 1c). Especially, the PFePc-I/C exhibits a high  $E_{1/2}$  of 0.948 V<sub>RHE</sub>, which is the highest among the values reported for the Fe–N<sub>4</sub>-based catalysts in recent papers (Table S2, Supporting Information).  $^{[5,22,24-27]}$  Besides, the PFePc-I also displays excellent stability, implying that the axial coordination is stable under the ORR conditions (Figure S3 and S4e,f, Supporting Information). Moreover, the kinetic current

density (@0.90 VRHE) of the ORR on the PFePc-L/C electrode increases as the field strength of the axial ligands decreases (Figure 1d). These results suggest that the ORR catalytic activity of Fe–N4 in PFePc-L shows a clear correlation with the strength of the crystal field that encompasses the Fe centers and could be tuned by ligand coordination.

For better understanding, a strong-field ligand-modified PFePc (PFePc-NCS) and a weak-field ligand-modified PFePc (PFePc-I) with medium coordination ability (Table S3, Supporting Information) are used to further explore the coordination structure and effect of ligand coordination on the ORR catalytic activity of Fe–N4. As shown in the X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) curves, the absorption edge position of PFePc-I and PFePc-NCS approaches that of Fe2O3, indicating an approximately +3 oxidation state of the Fe species (**Figure 2**a). Meanwhile, the remarkable shoulder peak at 7118 eV corresponding to the characteristic electric dipole transition of 1s→4pz in FePc is absent for both PFePc-NCS and PFePc-I,[28] suggesting that the local symmetry of the Fe–N4 sites changes from square-planar (D4h) to quasi-octahedral structure by the coordination of the axial ligands. The Fourier transformed (FT) k3 -weighted extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra of PFePc-I and PFePc-NCS are fitted to average coordination numbers 5.4 and 5.2 (Table S4, Supporting Information), respectively. These results show that the Fe in PFePc-NCS and PFePc-I is coordinated with four N (from Pc) and one or two axial ligand(s) (insets of Figure 2b,c). Besides, the peaks attributed to the Fe-NCS and Fe-I coordination are observed in the high-resolution S 2p X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectrum of PFePc-NCS and I 3d XPS spectrum of PFePc-I, respectively (Figure S4, Supporting Information). The XPS spectra of PFePc-L (Figure 2d) show significant negative shifts of the Fe2+ and Fe3<sup>+</sup> 2p peaks compared to that of PFePc, suggesting that the additional ligands (i.e., NCS<sup>−</sup>, OH<sup>−</sup>, and I<sup>−</sup>) could weaken the binding force between the Fe nucleus and the outer-shell electrons and further affect the configuration or energy level of Fe orbitals.[29]

Since the high ORR activity of Fe–N4 is reportedly originated from the highly active unpaired electrons in the high-energy *3d* orbitals of the Fe center,[30–32] the electron configuration of the Fe center in the axial-ligand coordinated PFePc was further analyzed by UV–vis spectroscopy, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), and temperature-dependent magnetic susceptibility (M-T) measurements. The UV–vis spectra of PFePc, PFePc-OH, PFePc-I, and PFePc-NCS (**Figure 3**a; Figure S5, Supporting Information) all show a distinct absorption peak in the range of 680–750 nm, corresponding to the Q band of phthalocyanine.[33] Obviously, the Q band red-shifts as the field strength of the axial ligands decreases, implying a decreased splitting energy of the split Fe 3*d* orbitals in the octahedral crystal field. The EPR tests were further employed to determine the spin states of the Fe centers in PFePc and PFePc-L (Figure 3b). For PFePc-I and PFePc-OH, the major characteristic signals at *g* = 5.91 and 2.09 are attributed to the high-spin Fe(III) ions with axial symmetry (*S* = 5/2), whereas the minor signal at *g* = 4.21 could be assigned to an intermediate-spin Fe species (*S* = 3/2, resulting from a rhombic distortion of the Fe (III) species).[34,35] Meanwhile, the high-spin Fe (III) signal disappears in the EPR spectra of PFePc-NCS and PFePc, indicating that the Fe (III) mainly exists with an intermediate-spin status (*S* = 3/2) in these two samples. Then, the electron-spin states of Fe in PFePc and PFePc-L were further confirmed by the **www.advancedsciencenews.com www.advenergymat.de**

57Fe Mössbauer spectroscopy. The Mössbauer spectra of PFePc and PFePc-I (Figure S6, Supporting Information; Figure 3c) are fitted to five doublet peaks, D1, D2, D3, D4, and D5, which could be assigned to the intermediate-spin Fe (II) (*S* = 1), highspin Fe (III) (*S* = 5/2), low-spin Fe (III) (*S* = 1/2), high-spin Fe (II) (*S* = 2), and intermediate-spin Fe (III) (*S* = 3/2), respectively (Table S5, Supporting Information).[36,37] Obviously, compared with PFePc, the proportion of D2 peak of PFePc-I increases significantly, indicating that the axial coordination could change the Fe center to a high-valence and high-spin state.

Furthermore, the M-T measurement was performed to quantify the unpaired electrons of the Fe centers in these PFePc-based samples. The average number of the unpaired Fe 3*d* electrons calculated from the susceptibility (*χm*) plots (Figure 3d) of PFePc-L increases as the field strength of the axial ligands decreases. This result also suggests that the Fe centers possess a highvalence and high-spin state after coordinating with the axial ligands. In order to highlight the effect of the axial ligands on the Fe 3*d* orbital configuration, the energy levels of the Fe 3*d* orbitals are calculated by using the hexa-coordinated PFePc-L (base on the EXAFS fitting) as the model structure (see details in Figure S7, Supporting Information), and the electron distribution in the Fe 3*d* orbitals is also presented base on the aforementioned spin analysis. As shown in Figure 3e, the Fe 3*d* orbital energy level of PFePc changes significantly after the axial coordination. The energy level of d <sup>2</sup> *<sup>z</sup>* decreases as the field strength of the axial ligands decreases, accompanied by a gradually narrowed energy gap between d <sup>2</sup> *<sup>z</sup>* and d*xz*d*yz* (Figure 3e).

To better understand the correlation between the Fe 3*d* electron configuration and ORR activity, the rate-determining step (RDS) of the ORR at the Fe–N4L site of PFePc-L in alkaline electrolytes was investigated by using the in situ electrochemical shell-isolated nanoparticle-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (in situ EC-SHINERS), EPR, Tafel analysis, and DFT calculations. The in-situ EC-SHINERS of PFePc-I shows that a peak (at 1401 cm<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> ) belonging to the ring breathing vibration caused by FePc adsorbing oxygen species (based on the theoretical Raman spectra) exists under the opencircuit potential (OCP) and disappears until the applied potential is lower than 0.9 VRHE (**Figure 4**a; Figure S8, Supporting Information), and remarkable peaks belonging to O2 and ˙O2 are found in the EPR spectrum of PFePc-I treated in O2-saturated DI water (Figure 4b), indicating that PFePc-I would precoordinate with O2 in the electrolyte. Besides, the peak (at 591 cm<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> ) belonging to *υ*(Fe–O or Fe–N) exists under OCP and the peak intensity increases gradually as the applied potential decreases (Figure 4a; Figure S9, Supporting Information),[38–40] indicating that the desorption of oxygen intermediates is the RDS. According to the in-situ EC-SHINERS results and the literature, the ORR process includes five intermediate steps (Figure 4c).[40] The ORR Tafel slopes of all the PFePc-L/C samples are about 40 mV dec−<sup>1</sup> (Figure 4d) while the Tafel slope of PFePc/C is about 60 mV dec−<sup>1</sup> (Figure S10, Supporting Information), suggesting that the last electron-transfer step (i.e., the OH desorption step) and first electron-transfer step (i.e., breaking of OO bond) is the RDS for PFePc-L/C and PFePc/C in the Tafel region, respectively.[25,41,42] Besides, the changes of Gibbs free energy (Figure 4e) show that the formation of \*OOH (R2) and desorption of OH (R5) are nonspontaneous (ΔG > 0) for PFePc-L at the equilibrium potential (i.e., at the ORR overpotential (*η*) of 0 V), and the desorption of OH (R5) with the largest ΔG is regarded as the RDS for the ORR on these Fe–N4L sites base on the thermodynamic analysis.

As the desorption of OH is the RDS of ORR on PFePc-L, the bonding strength between OH and the Fe center of PFePc-L can

be used as a new descriptor to describe the structure-related ORR activity of the Fe–N<sub>4</sub> sites. The possible orbital interactions between PFePc-L and OH are explored computationally to further analyze the OH desorption mechanism (Figure 4f). This OH desorption process involves one-electron transfer from the Fe d<sub>z²</sub> to the OH p<sub>x</sub>/p<sub>y</sub> for breaking the Fe–O bond. Thus, the bonding strength between PFePc and OH can be simplified to the interaction between the Fe d<sub>z²</sub> and OH p<sub>x</sub>/p<sub>y</sub> orbitals, [43] which is positively correlated to their intermolecular hardness,  $\eta_{\rm DA}$  (Figure 4g), i.e., the energy gap between the electron donor (d<sub>z²</sub>) and acceptor (p<sub>x</sub>/p<sub>y</sub>). [44,45] As illustrated in Figure 3e, the energy level of d<sub>z²</sub> can be tuned by the field strength of the axial ligands. Thus, the weak-field axial-ligand coordinated PFePc with a lower-energy d<sub>z²</sub> orbital (Figures 3e and 4g) exhibits a weaker bond with OH and therefore a higher ORR activity compared to the strong-field axial-ligand coordinated PFePc.

Finally, the effect of axial ligands on the ORR catalytic activity of PFePc in acidic electrolytes was investigated. **Figure 5**a shows that all of the PFePc-L/C display better ORR activities than PFePc/C, demonstrating that the axial ligands could optimize the catalytic performance of Fe–N<sub>4</sub> sites. More importantly, a good linear correlation between the  $E_{1/2}$  and  $\eta_{DA}$  is established

under the acidic condition (Figure 5b). As the RDS of PFePc-L/C in acidic electrolytes is evidenced to be the \*OH desorption by the DFT calculations (Figure S11, Supporting Information), the ORR activity of PFePc-L/C in acidic electrolytes could be simplified to the break of the interaction between Fe–N<sub>4</sub> and \*OH. Thus, the  $\eta_{DA}$  could also be employed as the descriptor for the ORR activity of Fe–N<sub>4</sub> sites in acidic electrolytes.

### 3. Conclusion

We provide valuable insights into the mechanism and strategy of controllably tuning the catalytic activity of the Fe–N<sub>4</sub> site toward the ORR by axial ligand coordination. Based on the electron distribution and orbital interaction analysis, the energy gap ( $\eta_{DA}$ ) between the  $\mathbf{d}_{z^2}$  of the Fe center and  $\mathbf{p}_x/\mathbf{p}_y$  of OH, which correlates with the field strength of the axial ligands, can be ascribed as a new descriptor for the ORR activity of Fe–N<sub>4</sub>-based catalysts with OH desorption as the RDS. Thus, PFePc-I with the lowest  $\mathbf{d}_{z^2}$  orbital energy level exhibits a high  $E_{1/2}$  of 0.948  $V_{RHE}$  in alkaline electrolytes, which is the best among the reported Fe–N<sub>4</sub>-based ORR

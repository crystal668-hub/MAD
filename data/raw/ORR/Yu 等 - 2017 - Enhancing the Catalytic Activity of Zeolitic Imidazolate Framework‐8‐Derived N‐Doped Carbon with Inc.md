## **Towards enhancing the oxygen reduction reaction catalytic activity of zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 derived N-doped carbon with incorporated CeO<sup>2</sup> nanoparticles**

**Abstract:** CeO<sup>2</sup> nanoparticles were incorporated into the cavity of zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) materials followed by high temperature pyrolysis to generate CeO2@N doped carbon materials. The introduction of the CeO<sup>2</sup> nanoparticles greatly enhanced the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalytic activity of the ZIF-8 derived carbon materials owing to existence of amounts of Ce3+ in CeO<sup>2</sup> and oxygen vacancies with high chemisorbed oxygen content and the well-maintained skeleton of the original ZIF-8 with uniform mesoporous structure. The resulted sample treated at 900 <sup>o</sup>C (CeO2@N-C-900) presented an excellent ORR catalytic activity under both acidic and alkaline electrolyte. The ORR test revealed the onset and half-wave potentials of the CeO2@N-C-900 were 1.003 V and 0.908 V vs. RHE, respectively, in 0.1 M KOH aqueous solution, which were comparable to those of Pt/C catalysts. Furthermore, it displayed much better stability and methanol crossover tolerance than Pt/C, indicating its good possibility to be a good candidate for the application in energy conversion.

# **Introduction**

Metal-air batteries have been regarded as one of the efficient devices to relieve the current energy problems. However, the sluggish kinetics during the cathode reaction inhibits their fast development. Introducing Pt/C catalyst into the system can greatly improve the efficiency, but the high cost and low storage in earth limit its wide application. Therefore, many other kinds of catalysts have been developed to replace Pt/C for catalyzing the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).[\[1\]](#page-6-0) Among all the candidates, nitrogen doped carbon materials have been proved to be an excellent one and great improvement has been achieved in this area.[\[2\]](#page-6-1) Typically, to obtain an N-doped carbon, one is posttreatment of the carbon materials with N element containing source under high temperature;[\[3\]](#page-6-2) the other one is direct carbonizing N containing precursor.

Owing to their high surface area, large pore size and fine tunability on structure and composition, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have shown great potential as templates and precursors for preparation of carbon-based materials.[\[4\]](#page-6-3) As an important member in MOFs family, zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) have been widely utilized as precursors for

catalyzing ORR owing to their ability to form 3D tetrahedral frameworks and rich content of nitrogen from the imidazolate ligands.[\[5\]](#page-6-4) However, the possible structure/morphology damage during carbonization and the loss of active sites thereby inhibit their development in some degree. In order to enhance the ORR catalytic activity of the ZIFs-derived N-doped carbon, many strategies have been adopted including 1) template-guiding synthesis, such as tellurium nanowires, [\[6\]](#page-6-5) ZnO multiarms[\[7\]](#page-6-6) and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide[\[8\]](#page-6-7) ; 2) co-doping with other elements, such as Cu,[\[9\]](#page-7-0) Fe[\[10\]](#page-7-1) , S[\[7\]](#page-6-6) and P[\[6\]](#page-6-5) ; 3) combining with other electroactive materials, such as graphene oxides[\[5a,](#page-6-4) [11\]](#page-7-2) and conducting polymers.[\[12\]](#page-7-3) In these above cases, hierarchical porous structures, enhanced conductivity, increased active sites or certain synergistic effect can be achieved and a better ORR catalytic performance is obtained thereby.

On the other hand, CeO<sup>2</sup> as one of the important member in the rare earth family has been extensively applied in various catalytic fields including CO oxidation, NO reduction and ORR. [\[13\]](#page-7-4) This is owing to the rich oxygen vacancies and swift transition between Ce3+ and Ce4+, which can serve as reactive sites and facilitate the activation of the reactants when the catalytic reaction occurs. In this sense, the proper combination of ZIFsderived carbon with CeO<sup>2</sup> nanoparticles is anticipated to present an excellent electrocatalytic performance via synergistic effect between them.

Herein, we selected ZIF-8 as a candidate for ZIFs and the direct generation of ZIF-8 on the CeO<sup>2</sup> particle surface produced CeO2@ZIF-8 particles. Via high temperature pyrolysis treatment of the as-synthesized particles, the CeO2@nitrogen doped carbon (CeO2@N-C) samples were obtained. The morphology of the ZIF-8 was well-maintained and the sample illustrated excellent ORR activity both under alkaline and acidic conditions.

# **Results and Discussion**

**Scheme 1**. Formation process for CeO2@N-C particles.

The preparation process of the CeO2@N-C is presented in Scheme 1. After synthesis of CeO<sup>2</sup> nanoparticles (NPs) in alcohol/water mixture, they are encapsulated by a layer of ZIF-8 in the presence of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), which helps the morphology control of the ZIF-8 and the coordination of Zn2+ ions with the oxides. The obtained CeO2@ZIF-8 particles are

then treated by high temperature pyrolysis and the ZIF-8 layer is carbonized and the CeO2@N-C was finally obtained.

**Figure 1**. XRD patterns of different samples.

The XRD patterns of the CeO2@ZIF-8 before and after pyrolysis are shown in Figure 1. Compared with the curve of the pure ZIF-8, the CeO2@ZIF-8 gives typical peaks of both CeO<sup>2</sup> (JCPDS No. 43-1002) and ZIF-8. After pyrolysis, the peaks of the CeO<sup>2</sup> become sharpened, indicating the better crystallinity of the CeO<sup>2</sup> in the final product. Additionally, a wide peak around 25<sup>o</sup> is related to the amorphous state in the sample, corresponding to the carbonization of the ZIF-8 layer into nitrogen doped carbon. No original ZIF-8 or Zn-related components peaks are detected, indicating the complete transformation of the ZIF-8 into N-doped C and removing of the

**Figure 2.** TEM and SEM images of CeO2@ZIF-8 (a and b) and CeO2@N-C-900 (c and d).

After reaction, about 3 spherical CeO<sup>2</sup> NPs in average with size of *d*av=120 5 nm are encapsulated by a layer of ZIF-8 with dodecahedral shape, as shown in Figure 2a and S1. From the SEM image (Figure 2b), one can observe some of the CeO<sup>2</sup> NPs protrude the ZIF-8 layer. After high temperature pyrolysis, no separation of the two components is observed, indicating the

strong interaction between them. Although some aggregation is formed and a bit CeO<sup>2</sup> NPs come out of the encapsulation of the original ZIF-8 shell (Figure 2c), no free CeO<sup>2</sup> NPs are found in the whole detecting range. Furthermore, the dodecahedral shaped skeleton is well maintained, as can be found in the SEM

**Figure 3.** TEM images of pure CeO<sup>2</sup> and ZIF-8 before (a, c) and after pyrolysis treatment at 900 <sup>o</sup>C (b, d).

On the other hand, the morphology of the two pure counterparts (CeO<sup>2</sup> and ZIF-8) was also studied for control experiments. No shape change is observed for the CeO<sup>2</sup> spheres except the surface is greatly roughed with formation of porous structure (Figure 3a and b). On the contrary, the initial dodecahedral shape of the ZIF-8 is seriously damaged after pyrolysis treatment and only pieces of aggregation are found (Figure 3c and d). This reveals the supporting role of CeO<sup>2</sup> for keeping the framework of the ZIF-8 layer.

**Figure 4**. XPS survey spectrum (a) and high-resolution N 1s (b), Ce 3d (c) and O 1s (d) spectra of CeO2@N-C-900.

In order to get an excellent ORR catalyst based on nitrogen doped carbon, the N element content and the relative content of different N types are considered to be important factors. From the XPS analyses, the surface content of N is calculated to be 1.84% for CeO2@N-C-900, lower than that of N-C-900 (3.03%

(Figure 4a and S2a). Furthermore, the high-resolution N 1s spectrum (Figure 4b) displays four divided peaks centered at 397.7 eV, 399.3 eV and 400.6 eV, 404.2 eV, which is assigned to pyridinic, pyrrolic, graphitic and oxidized N, respectively.[\[2b\]](#page-6-8) The pyridinic N presents the highest content with the value of 45.5% compared to 21.7% and 17.5% for pyrrolic and graphitic N, respectively, which is considered to be an effective type for improving the ORR activity.[\[11a\]](#page-7-2) The content of the pyridinic N in N-C-900 is estimated to be 34.4%, a bit lower than that of CeO2@N-C-900 (Figure S2b). As for CeO2@N-C-800, the surface N content is 4.34% (Figure S3a), while nearly no N element is detected for CeO2@N-C-1000 (Figure S4a), indicating the much severer N losing under higher temperature treatment. Although CeO2@N-C-800 illustrates a higher N content than CeO2@N-C-900, its lower specific surface area may inhibit its ability to present a high activity toward ORR (vide infra). No Zn peak is detectable in all samples, confirming the removing of Zn element during the acid treatment process.

The Ce 3d spectrum of CeO2@N-C-900 is presented in Figure 4c and eight peaks can be observed, where the peaks labeled as uʹ and vʹ positioned at 884.5 and 903.7 eV, respectively, are assigned to Ce3+ and others labeled as u, uʺ, uʺʹ and v, vʺ, vʺʹ are related to the characteristic peaks of Ce4+ . The percentage of Ce3+ in sample is 36% based on the fitted areas of the corresponding peaks of Ce3+ and Ce4+ . The presence of Ce3+ defects and the formation of oxygen vacancies are considered to provide catalytically active sites, which is beneficial for achieving enhanced ORR performance.[\[14\]](#page-7-5) Furthermore, the O 1s highresolution spectrum is deconvoluted into three peaks located at 529.1, 531.8 and 533.16 eV (Figure 4d). The first one labeled as O corresponds to a lattice oxygen of the metal oxides and the one denoted as O is assigned to C-O combined oxygen. The peak at 531.8 eV labeled as O is ascribed to chemisorbed oxygen that is reported to be the most active oxygen in ORR. The chemisorbed O<sup>2</sup> ratio in CeO2@N-C-900 is estimated to be 66%, which is related to the presence of Ce3+, which introduces oxygen vacancies and unsaturated chemical bond on the catalyst surface and creates a charge imbalance thereby.

**Figure 5.** Raman spectrum of CeO2@N-C-900 (a) and the magnified one in the range of 360 to 650 cm-1 (b) and 810 to 2000 cm-1 (c).

The Raman spectrum of the sample was collected for further investigation (Figure 5). Two characteristic peaks centred at 1350 and 1596 cm-1 are observed, which are related to the topological defects (D band) and the crystalline graphitic domains (G band), respectively. Generally, a higher ratio of the two bands intensity (*I*D/*I*G) means a higher disordered degree or more defect sites in the sample and a better electrocatalytic performance may be obtained thereby.[\[16\]](#page-7-7) Based on the Raman spectra, CeO2@N-C-900 shows a *I*D/*I*<sup>G</sup> value of 1.81 (Figure 5c), while N-C-900 and CeO2@N-C-800 gives the value of 1.89 and 1.59, respectively (Figure S7b and 8c). As for CeO2@N-C-1000, these above two peaks is hardly detected and the peak located at 1168 cm-1 assigned to CeO<sup>2</sup> dominates in the whole spectrum, assistant with the XPS result. This should be originated from the

destroying of the carbon layer under such a high temperature (Figure S9c). It should be noted the band at 590 cm-1 ascribed to oxygen vacancies is detected in CeO2@N-C-900, and the relative concentration of oxygen vacancies based on the peak areas of the bands located at 590 and 460 cm-1 is 0.11 (Figure 5b). The oxygen vacancies are proposed to accelerate the activation of adsorbed O<sup>2</sup> into superoxide (O<sup>2</sup> - ), an intermediated species in the ORR reaction.[\[14b\]](#page-7-8)

**Figure 6**. a) CV curves of CeO2@N-C-900 (bottom) and Pt/C recorded in N<sup>2</sup> and O<sup>2</sup> saturated 0.1 M KOH; b) LSV curves for different samples in O<sup>2</sup> saturated 0.1 M KOH with rotating rate of 1600 rpm; c) LSV curves of CeO2@N-C-900 measured at different rotating rates; d) Corresponding K-L plots of CeO2@N-C-900 in various potential range (vs. RHE, the inset gives the calculated electron transfer number at various potentials).

The ORR catalytic activities of the CeO2@N-C-900 was investigated and compared with commercial Pt/C. From the CV curves in Figure 5a, no obvious redox peak is detected for both of the two samples in N2-saturated electrolyte. On the contrary, a well-defined cathodic peak occurs at around 0.897 V and 0.872 V for CeO2@N-C-900 and Pt/C, respectively, when the electrolyte solution is saturated with O2. The small gap between the two samples indicates the comparable catalytic performance of CeO2@N-C-900 to Pt/C.

The RDE experiment was further carried out to confirm the catalytic activity of CeO2@N-C-900. The LSV curves listed in Figure 5b give an onset and a half-wave potential at 1.003 V, 0.908 V and 0.982 V, 0.845 V and a cathodic current density of 5.526 and 5.781 mA cm-2 at the potential of 0.6 V vs. RHE for CeO2@N-C-900 and Pt/C in 0.1 M KOH, respectively. However, under the same measurement conditions, the pure counterparts, N-C-900 and CeO<sup>2</sup> present an onset potential at 0.888 V and 0.719 V with the cathodic current density of 4.449 mA cm-2 and 0.709 mA cm-2 at the potential of 0.6 V vs. RHE, respectively, worse than those of the CeO2@N-C-900. Furthermore, the samples obtained at 800 and 1000 <sup>o</sup>C also display more negative onset potential and lower current density (Table 1). Apart from that, the ORR catalytic performance of the product from pyrolysizing the mixture of ZIF-8 and CeO<sup>2</sup> at 900 <sup>o</sup>C was measured in order to confirm the advantage of the incorporation of CeO<sup>2</sup> into ZIF-8. As a result, the sample named as CeO2/N-C-900 presents an onset potential and current density of 0.862 V and 1.146 mA cm-2 , respectively, much lower than that of CeO2@N-C-900 (Figure S11).

| Sample        | Eonset/V | E1/2/V | J0.6V/mA cm-2 | n0.6V |
|---------------|----------|--------|---------------|-------|
| CeO2          | 0.719    | 0.428  | 0.709         | 1.81  |
| N-C-900       | 0.888    | 0.774  | 4.449         | 3.53  |
| CeO2/N-C-900  | 0.862    | 0.657  | 1.146         | 2.29  |
| CeO2@N-C-800  | 0.968    | 0.796  | 4.05          | 3.43  |
| CeO2@N-C-900  | 1.003    | 0.908  | 5.526         | 3.97  |
| CeO2@N-C-1000 | 0.848    | 0.667  | 2.323         | 2.98  |
| Pt/C          | 0.982    | 0.845  | 5.781         | 4.10  |

The LSV polarization curves of the CeO2@N-C-900 at different rotating rates and the corresponding K-L plots are presented in Figure 5c and d. With increasing the rotating rates, no change is observed for the onset potential, while the current density increases because the mass transport is improved at a higher rate. The nice linearity and near coincidence of the K-L plots indicates the first-order reaction kinetics and the similar electron transfer number per O<sup>2</sup> molecule at different potentials in ORR. The calculated electron transfer number is 3.91-4.10 for CeO2@N-C-900 in the range from 0.2 V to 0.8 V vs. RHE, in agreement with an efficient four-electron transfer pathway (Figure 5d). By contrast, the other samples pyrolized at 800 and 1000 <sup>o</sup>C and the one without CeO<sup>2</sup> give an electron transfer number of 2.98-3.53 in the same potential range, indicating their mixing pathways with 2 and 4 electrons (Figure S10a-f). It should also be noted the pure CeO<sup>2</sup> after the same temperature treatment and CeO2/N-C-900 only presents an electron transfer number of *ca.* 2, implying its 2-electron-dominated pathway (Figure S10g and h, S11a and b).

**Figure 7** Nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms (a) and the corresponding pore size distributions (b) of different samples.

Considering the N-doped carbon layer, the different electronegativity and size of the nitrogen atoms are considered to change the charge distribution and electronic properties of the carbon materials owing to the formation of electron modulation.[\[2a\]](#page-6-1) Companied with the doping-induced defects, the chemical activity of the carbon can be further changed, which leads to the electrocatalytic performance for ORR. Apart from that, the specific surface area also influence the ORR activity of the samples and a higher surface area may lead to much more active sites for the catalysis. As a result, CeO2@N-C-800, CeO2@N-C-900, CeO2@N-C-1000, and N-C-900 present a BET specific surface area of 103.6, 439.4, 10.5 and 922.0 m 2 g -1 (Figure 7a). The introduction of the CeO<sup>2</sup> greatly reduces the surface area of the N-doped carbon. Although CeO2@N-C-800 presents a higher N content, the smaller specific surface area and the lower *I*D/*I*<sup>G</sup> result in its worse ORR activity than

CeO2@N-C-900. Because the severe breaching of the carbon layer in CeO2@N-C-1000 as discussed above, this sample gives the ORR performance similar with that of CeO2/N-C-900 (Table 1). However, it is not acceptable for explaining the better ORR activity of CeO2@N-C-900 than that of N-C-900 since the later one behaves larger specific surface area, higher N content and *I*D/*I*<sup>G</sup> value (vide ante). Therefore, the excellent ORR catalytic activity of the CeO2@N-C-900 should be originated from the synergistic effect between the two components.

Albeit with lower specific surface area than N-C-900, CeO2@N-C-900 presents a much uniform mesoporous structure compared with N-C-900 and other two samples (Figure 7b), which is beneficial to the kinetic mass transport during the ORR.[\[17\]](#page-7-9) On the other hand, the presence of Ce3+ accompanied by oxygen vacancies can enhance the ORR catalytic activity of ZIF-8 derived carbon. Compared with the pure CeO2, the Ce3+ content in CeO2@N-C-900 is greatly increased owing to the reduction environment during the carbonization process (36% vs. 10%). The existence of oxygen vancancies in CeO2@N-C-900 is observed from the Raman spectra with a value of *A*590/*A*460=0.11. However, nearly no corresponding peaks are detected in both N-C-900 and CeO<sup>2</sup> (Figure S7a and S9a). As for the control experiment with carbonizing the mixture of pure CeO<sup>2</sup> and ZIF-8, the product gives lower Ce3+ (15%) and undetected oxygen vacancies content (Figure S6b and S9b), revealing the better synergistic effect originated from the core-shell nanostructure that promises the good contact between CeO<sup>2</sup> and the carbon layer. Furthermore, the higher O ratio in CeO2@N-C-900 (66%) discussed above illustrates the existence of more chemisorbed oxygen, much higher than that of N-C-900 (42%, Figure S2c), pure CeO<sup>2</sup> (23%, Figure S5c) and CeO2/N-C-900 (27%, Figure S6c), and an enhanced ORR activity is anticipated.

**Figure 8**. a) LSV curves for CeO2@N-C-900 and Pt/C in O<sup>2</sup> saturated 0.1 M HClO<sup>4</sup> with rotating rate of 1600 rpm; b) Corresponding K-L plots of CeO2@N-C-900 in various potential range (vs. RHE, the inset gives the calculated electron transfer number at various potentials).

It should be noted the CeO2@N-C-900 also displays good catalytic activity for ORR under acidic condition. As shown in Figure 8a, CeO2@N-C-900 shows an onset potential of 0.795 V and a half-wave potential of 0.670 V in 0.1 M HClO<sup>4</sup> aqueous solution. From the K-L plots in Figure 8b, the electron transfer number is 4 per oxygen molecule. These results are comparable to those of the Pt/C catalysts under the same condition.

The Pt/C encounters methanol crossover that restricts its application in energy storage and conversion. This can be found in Figure 9a, where a remarkable decreasing in current density occurs upon injecting 11.03 mL of methanol (3 M). By contrast, little change is observed in current density for CeO2@N-C-900, demonstrating its high stability and strong tolerance to methanol crossover. Furthermore, the electrocatalytic stability of the CeO2@N-C-900 was evaluated by chronoamperometry at 0.565 V vs. RHE in O<sup>2</sup> saturated 0.1 M KOH solution. After 20000 s

operation, a slight current loss of 4% was detected, revealing the high stability of the sample. On the contrary, the Pt/C catalyst only gives a current retention of 83% after test (Figure 9b). The similar results can be obtained for CeO2@N-C-900 and Pt/C undergoing the test in 0.1 M HClO<sup>4</sup> electrolyte. Compared with a current loss of 20% for Pt/C, a smaller value (7%) is observed for CeO2@N-C-900 (Figure S12). An accelerated durability test was performed to further explore the stability of CeO2@N-C-900 by cycling the potential between 0.165 and 1.165 V in O<sup>2</sup> saturated 0.1 M KOH solution at a scan rate of 10 mV s-1 . After 3000 cycles, nearly no half-wave potential decreasing is detected except a slight drop in current density (Figure 9c). The similar results can be obtained in 0.1 M HClO<sup>4</sup> electrolyte, where CeO2@N-C-900 presents a small *E*1/2 value of 21 mV (Figure 9d), illustrating its high durability toward ORR application.

All measurements were conducted in an O<sup>2</sup> saturated 0.1 M KOH aqueous solution with an electrode rotating rate of 1600 rpm; LSV curves for CeO2@N-C-900 in O<sup>2</sup> saturated 0.1 M KOH solution (c) and O<sup>2</sup> saturated 0.1 M HClO<sup>4</sup> solution (d) before and after 3000 cycles.

## **Conclusions**

Core-shell structured CeO2@ZIF-8 was successfully synthesized with about three spherical CeO<sup>2</sup> in average encapsulated by the dodecahedral ZIF-8. The high temperature pyrolysis on the CeO2@ZIF-8 led to the transformation of ZIF-8 into N doped C layer and the resulted CeO2@N-C maintained well the original dodecahedral skeleton. The ORR test revealed the sample treated at 900 <sup>o</sup>C behaved the best activity with the onset potential of 1.003 V vs. RHE in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte that is comparable to that of Pt/C catalyst. The excellent ORR catalytic performance could be attributed to the effecteive synergystic effect between CeO<sup>2</sup> and ZIF-8 derived carbon, where the former one ensures the achievement of wellmaintained morphology with uniform mesoporous structure and large specific surface area and the later provides reduction enviroment for generating much more Ce3+ and oxygen vacancies with catalytic active chemisorbed O2. Additionally, the CeO2@N-C-900 also illustrated good ORR activity in 0.1 M HClO<sup>4</sup> electrolyte with the calculated electron transfer number of 4 per O<sup>2</sup> molecule in a wide potential range, consistent with that in the alkaline condition. Furthermore, CeO2@N-C-900 gave much better stability and strong tolerance to methanol crossover than Pt/C, demonstrating its great potential for application in energy conversion.

Cerium(III) nitrate hexahydrate (99%, Aldrich), ethylic acid, ethylene glycol (EG), gladal acetic acid, methanol, zinc nitrate hexahydrate (Beijing Chemical Reagent Company), isopropyl alcohol (≥99.5 % ), polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP, Mw=58000, K29-32, Sinopharm), 2 methylimidazole (98%, Hmim, Aladdin), Nafion D-520 (5 wt%, Alfa Aesar) were used as received. The commercial 20 wt% Pt/C catalyst (20 wt% Pt on Vulcan XC72R carbon) was purchased from Johnson Matthey Company (Shanghai, China).

### **Synthesis of CeO<sup>2</sup>**

CeO<sup>2</sup> NPs were synthesized by a previous method with a slight modification.[\[18\]](#page-7-10) Typically, 2.0 g of Ce(NO3)3·6H2O was ultrasonically dispersed in a mixture of CH3COOH/H2O (4 mL, v:v=1:1) for 10 min, followed by gradual addition of 60 mL of EG in 30 min under vigorous stirring. Subsequently, the aqueous solution was subjected to a hydrothermal autoclave, and the reaction was conducted at 180 <sup>o</sup>C for 2.5 h. After naturally cooling to room temperature, the precipitates were collected by centrifugation and washed for several times with water and ethanol. Finally, the pale yellow products were dried at 65 <sup>o</sup>C for 5 h for further characterization and application.

### **Synthesis of CeO2@ZIF-8**

The as-synthesized CeO<sup>2</sup> NPs (150 mg) were mixed with PVP aqueous solution (5 mL) with the aid of ultrasonication for 10 min to form a homogenous solution. The mixture was then gradually added into 30 mL of Zn(NO3)<sup>2</sup> aqueous solution in a period of 60 min under the vigorous stirring at room temperature. After that, Hmim (30 mL) was added into the solution followed by continuous stirring for another 24 h. Finally, the resultant samples were collected by centrifugation, washed for several times with CH3OH and dried in an oven at 50 <sup>o</sup>C for 12 h. The product was labelled as CeO2@ZIF-8 and was white in colour. The final concentration of each component was as follows:[PVP]=0.85 M, [CeO2]=13.40 mM, [Zn(NO3)2]=55.40 mM and [Hmim]=0.23 M.

### **Synthesis of CeO2-N-C**

CeO2@ZIF-8 was annealed for 2 h at different temperatures (800, 900 and 1000 <sup>o</sup>C) with a heating rate of 5 <sup>o</sup>C min-1 under a continuous flow of nitrogen. The products named as CeO2@N-C-800, CeO2@N-C-900, CeO2@N-C-1000 represent the annealed CeO2@ZIF-8 at 800, 900, 1000 <sup>o</sup>C,natural cooling respectively. The as-prepared samples were treated with HCl aqueous solution (1 M) to remove Zn element. Finally, the resultant samples were collected by centrifugation, washed for several times with water and dried in an oven at 50 <sup>o</sup>C for 12 h CeO2@N-C-800 and CeO2@N-C-900 were black-gray in colour and CeO2@N-C-1000 was white in colour.

### **Synthesis of N-C-900**

The synthesis of ZIF-8 is similar to that of CeO2@ZIF-8 in the absence of CeO2, and the product was annealed at 900 <sup>o</sup>C with a heating rate of 5

<sup>o</sup>C min-1 for 2 h under a nitrogen atmosphere. The as-prepared sample was also treated with HCl aqueous solution (1 M) to remove Zn element. The sample was named as N-C-900.

### **Synthesis of CeO2/N-C-900**

The CeO<sup>2</sup> and ZIF-8 materials with mass ratio of 1:1 were mixed thoroughly, and the product was annealed at 900 <sup>o</sup>C with a heating rate of 5 <sup>o</sup>C min-1 for 2 h under a nitrogen atmosphere. The as-prepared sample was also treated with HCl aqueous solution (1 M) to remove Zn element. The sample was named as CeO2/N-C-900.

#### **Physical characterization**

X-ray powder diffraction patterns (XRD) was measured with Siemens D5005 diffractometer with Cu-K radiation ( = 1.5418 Å) at 40 kV and 30 mA with a scanning rate of 5 <sup>o</sup> min-1 . Transmission electron microscopic (TEM) and high resolution TEM (HRTEM) analysis were carried out by JEM-2100F at 200 kV. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images were conducted on a JEOL SM-6360LV field-emissiongun scanning electron microscope. X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were recorded by using ESCALAB 250 spectrometer with a mono X-ray source Al K excitation (1486.6 eV), and the date were analyzed with using an XPSPEAK software. Raman spectra were conducted on a LabRAM XploRA laser Raman spectrometer (HORIBA Jobin Yvon CO. Ltd) using a 532 nm laser with incident power of 1 mW. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area was calculated by nitrogen adsorption and desorption on an ASAP 2020.

#### **ORR measurements**

The electrochemical tests were conducted on an electrochemical workstation (CHI660E, Shanghai) with typical three-electrode system. The platinum sheet and the Ag/AgCl electrode (with saturated KCl solution) were used as counter and reference electrode, respectively. The catalyst-modified glassy carbon (GC) rotating ring-disk electrode (RDE) (Pine Instrument Company, USA) with diameter of 5 mm and area of 0.196 cm<sup>2</sup> was used as work electrode. The KOH (0.1 M) and HClO<sup>4</sup> (0.1 M) aqueous solution were used as electrolyte under different conditions. High-purity N<sup>2</sup> and O<sup>2</sup> were used to give the O2-free and O<sup>2</sup> saturated solution, respectively. For working electrode measurements, 2 mg of catalyst was dissolved in 1 mL of mixture containing 50 μL of Nafion (5 wt % ), 190 μL of ethanol and 760 μL of H2O under ultrasonication for at least 40 min to form a homogeneous ink. Then 14.2 μL of the catalyst ink was loaded onto the pre-polished surface of GC electrode via a micro-syringe, achieving a mass loading of 0.289 mg cm-2 The as-prepared electrodes were dried at room temperature. Prior to each RDE experiment, the electrolyte solutions were purged with O<sup>2</sup> for at least 30 min to make the electrolyte saturated with oxygen. All the experiments were carried out at ambient temperature and all potentials were converted to reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE).

*E* (vs RHE) = *E* (vs Ag/AgCl)+*E* (Ag/AgCl) reference +0.0591\*pH

The electrochemical performance of the catalysts was evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and linear sweeping voltammetry (LSV) measurements in an aqueous solution of 0.1 M KOH or 0.1 M HClO4. For CV measurement, the potential range is cyclically scanned between 0.165 and 1.165 V in alkaline aqueous or between 0.256 and 1.256 V in acidic solution at a scan rate of 10 mV s-1 after purging O<sup>2</sup> or N<sup>2</sup> gas for 30 min. LSV measurements were conducted at different rotating rates ranging from 425 to 2025 rpm with a sweeping rate of 10 mV s-1 . All the potential scan polarity is from positive to negative. Chronoamperometric responses were performed at 0.565V vs. RHE in alkaline medium or 0.5 V vs. RHE in acidic medium for 20000 s at a speed of 1600 rpm. Accelerated durability tests were carried out in an O<sup>2</sup> saturated 0.1 M KOH or HClO<sup>4</sup> aqueous solution with the potential cyclic between 0.1651.165 V in alkaline solution and between 0.256 and 1.256 V in acidic solution at a scan rate of 10 mV s-1 .

The Koutechy-Levich (K-L) plots were analyzed at different electrode potentials. Based on the K-L equation (Equation 1 and 2), the electron transfer number (*n*) is calculated from the slope of the K-L plot:

$$\frac{1}{j} = \frac{1}{j_{\rm L}} + \frac{1}{j_{\rm K}} = \frac{1}{B\omega^{1/2}} + \frac{1}{j_{\rm K}} \quad (1)$$

$$B = 0.2nFC_{0_2}(D_{0_2})^{2/3}(v)^{-1/6}$$
 (2)

where *j* represents the measured current density, *j*<sup>K</sup> is the kinetic limiting current density, is the electrode rotating rate, *j*<sup>L</sup> is the diffusion-limiting current density, F is the Faraday constant (96485 C mol-1 ), *C*O2 is the bulk concentration of O<sup>2</sup> (1.26×10-6 mol cm-3 ), *D*O2 is the diffusion coefficient of O<sup>2</sup> (1.93×10-5 cm<sup>2</sup> s -1 ), and *υ* is the kinematic viscosity of the electrolyte (0.01cm<sup>2</sup> s -1 ) in 0.1M KOH. In 0.1 M HClO4, *C*O2 is the bulk concentration of O<sup>2</sup> (2.4×10-4 mol cm-3 ), *D*O2 is the diffusion coefficient of O<sup>2</sup> (1.7×10-5 cm<sup>2</sup> s -1 ), and *υ* is the kinematic viscosity of the electrolyte (0.01cm<sup>2</sup> s -1 ).

Developing high efficiency and durability catalysts for the electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is fundamental to achieve the largescale commercial application of fuel cells and metal-air batteries. Herein, a series of Co N doped bi-functional hierarchical porous electrocatalysts were synthesized using polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) as soft template to assist the Zn/Co bimetal Zeolitic Imidazolate Framework (BMZIF) to form micro-/ mesoporous carbon nanospheres via a convenient one-step solution synthesis method, followed by pyrolysis to form carbon nanospheres catalysts. The as-prepared Co/N co-doped carbon exhibits outstanding performances in the ORR and OER due to the formed hierarchical pores architecture and the high surface area. The catalyst displays superior ORR performance with a high half-wave potential of 0.89 V, and a remarkable long-term stability in 0.1 M KOH. In addition, the electrocatalyst elicits a low voltage of 1.72 V under the current density of 10 mAcm <sup>2</sup> . Moreover, the zinc-air battery fabricated with P-CNCo-3 delivers a power density of 175.1 mWcm <sup>2</sup> , a high specific capacity of 791 mAhg <sup>1</sup> and an energy density of 976 Wh kg <sup>1</sup> at 20 mAcm <sup>2</sup> .

## **Introduction**

With the expansion of several infrastructures in our modern society, the resulting energy crisis and environmental issues have gradually become the primary issues encountered by the development of the human society. The demand for clean energy has progressively stimulated in-depth research on efficient, cheap, and clean energy conversion and storage devices.[1] As promising clean energy devices, fuel cells[2] and metal-air batteries[3] have attracted a tremendous load of attention. Generally, the performance of energy conversion and storage devices depends on the properties of the electrocatalyst materials, thus researchers have come to focus on exploring the key materials in these devices. The kinetics of the cathode oxygen reduction reaction of the fuel cell and metalair batter are limited, and the high cost of only commercially available Pt/C catalyst has seriously hindered the commercialization part of its development.[4] Thus, the development of cost-efficient and durable electrocatalysts with excellent performance is highly desired.

Transition metal-nitrogen atom doped porous carbon materials (M N C) are favored by researchers due to their low cost, high performance and adequate stability.[5] Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) have many advantages, such as a stable structure, high specific surface area, adjustable pore structure,[6]

and metal-nitrogen doped porous carbon-based catalytic materials obtained by high temperature pyrolysis, conferring it an excellent performance in the field of electrochemical catalysis. Zhang et al. obtained Co/N-doped porous carbon fibers with high ORR performance, which were fabricated by the electrospinning-assisted assembly of BMZIFs. The high catalytic performances root in the high surface area and dense assembly of MOFs within the electrospun fibers.[7] Song et al. developed MOF derived S and N co-doped carbon catalyst for ORR by using ZIF-8 precursor. Results indicate that the high specific surface area and suitable porosity generated in the S and N co-doped carbon, which are beneficial for the mass transportation and active sites loading.[8] However, the reported complex post-operation conditions increased the preparation cost and the difficulty in controlling the composition impede their large-scale applications. Therefore, finding a facile and effective strategy to synthesis bi-functional electrocatalysts is still a challenge. Different surfactants such as PVP,[9] P123,[10] F127[11] etc. are used as structure-directing agents to improve the pore structure of catalysts. These could serve to adjust the morphology of the material, increase the porous structure and conductivity, and then enhance the catalytic activity.

In this work, we designed a novel and simple polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) assisted method for synthesizing Co N-doped micro-/mesoporous carbon nanospheres. Considering that Co2<sup>+</sup> and Zn2<sup>+</sup> have the same albite coordination with 2-methylimidazole, ZIF can be formed in any desired Zn/Co ratio. The zinc/cobalt bimetallic ZIF volatilizes zinc to form a microporous structure at high temperature, increasing its specific surface area. The presence of PVP can also lead to increments in the N content and the formation of a rich mesoporous structure, which optimizes the transmission of oxygen. The manufactured

#### **Results and discussion**

PVP assisted BMZIF synthesis is divided into three steps as illustrated in Figure 1. Firstly, PVP of different quality and an appropriate proportion of zinc nitrate and cobalt nitrate are dissolved in methanol, then the methanol solution is mixed with 2-methylimidazole dissolved solution and stirred quickly, followed by subsequent pyrolysis treatment to form a carbon nanospheres catalyst.

The constituent phases of the electrocatalysts were tested by X-ray diffraction as laid out in Figure 2a. There are obvious peaks at 7.4°, 10.3°, 12.7° and 17.9°, corresponding to the (001), (002), (112) and (222) crystal planes of the standard ZIF-67 and ZIF-8 respectively,[12] which proves the successful synthesis of the precursor. Due to its low Co content, the XRD diffraction

pattern of P-CNCo-n only depicts the diffraction peak of C (002) in Figure 2b.

Scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy images revealed that with the addition of PVP, the bimetal ZIF forms extremely small nanospheres with a particle size of roughly 20–30 nm (Figure S1). These nanospheres have a uniform morphology and size (Figure 3a and 3b). It can illustrate from the infrared spectrum (Figure S2) that compared with PVP-BMZIF-0, PVP-BMZIF-3 has a C=O bond stretching vibration peak at 1690 cm<sup>-1</sup>, which confirms the existence of PVP in the precursor.

The transmission electron microscopy images indicated the rich hole-level structure of as-synthesized P-CNCo-3 (Figure 4a and b). Considering the low constant of Co, Figure 4(c-f) clearly shows that C, N, Co elements are uniformly distributed without agglomeration. A High-resolution transmission electron micro-

scopy (HRTEM) image (Figure 4g) delineates a well-resolved (111) lattice fringe (0.2 nm) for an embedded Co nanoparticle. Given the microporous, mesoporous pore-level structure (Figure 4a, 4b and 4 g), the sample has a large specific surface area, which is conducive to the exposure of catalytic active sites and boosts the diffusion ability to improve the particles' contact and reaction capacity with oxygen.

The disorder carbon degree of the catalysts was investigated with Raman spectra. As shown in the Figure 5, both the D band (1337 cm $^{-1}$ ) and G band (1596 cm $^{-1}$ ) are clearly observed, indicating the coexistence of disordered sp $^3$  carbon (D band) and graphite sp $^2$  carbon (G band), respectively. Thus, the intensity ratio of  $I_D/I_G$  is applied to identify the degree of disordered carbon structure. The sample without PVP has the smallest  $I_D/I_G$  value of 1.08. As the PVP content rises, the P-CNCo-1(1.10), P-CNCo-3(1.13) and P-CNCo-9 (1.16) values

steadily augment, pointing out the high content of defective sites in the carbon-based catalysts, and suggesting the PVP in the PVP-BMZIF-n (n=0,1,3,9) precursors contributes to the formation of disordered carbon structure.

The porous structure of the as-obtained electrocatalysts was collected by nitrogen adsorption-desorption tests. Typical IV-type hysteresis loops demonstrated the presence of mesopores structure in the P-CNCo-n[14] (Figure 6a). The pore size distribution (Figure 6b) and structural parameters (Table 1) derived from the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda method exhibits that the catalysts have micropores and mesopores. P-CNCo-3 has the highest Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of 874 m2g <sup>1</sup> , meanwhile P-CNCo-0 and P-CNCo-9 have surface areas of 771 m2g <sup>1</sup> and 487 m2g <sup>1</sup> , respectively (Table 1). Hence, the addition of an appropriate amount of PVP is beneficial to increase the specific surface area. In sharp contrast, SBET of P-CNCo-3 is larger than P-CNCo-0 while their micropore areas are similar and the pores mainly concentrated on 10∼40 nm (Figure 6b), which can be explained by the fact that a large amount of mesoporous structure is generated after PVP pyrolysis. However, excessive amounts of PVP may cause the structure to collapse and reduce the material's specific surface area.[15]

The high-resolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was conducted to clarify the element bonding configurations in the P-CNCo-n (n=0,1,3,9). The high-resolution N 1s spectrum of P-CNCo-n (Figure 7a-d) could be divided into four categories: graphitic-N, pyrrolic N, pyridinic N, and pyridinic-N-oxide.[16] Furthermore, the Co 2p spectrum (Figure 7e) from P-CNCo-0 and P-CNCo-3 further indicated the presence of Co N and Co O spices, which is correlated with the enhanced ORR activity.[17]

(RDE). The ORR performance of the carbon-based electrocatalysts was tested by cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements in N2- and O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH electrolyte. Figure 8 indicates that no apparent oxygen reduction peak appeared in the N2-saturated solution, while the cathode redox peak was exhibited in the O2-saturated electrolyte. The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves demonstrated that P-CNCo-0, P-CNCo-1 and P-CNCo-9 possessed limited activities at 1600 rpm (Figure 9a). P-CNCo-3 exhibited a high ORR performance onset potential (*E*o) of 1.01 V, half-wave potential (*E*1/2) of 0.89 V),

outperformed P-CNCo-0 (*E*o=0.91 V, *E*1/2=0.86 V) and commercial Pt/C (*E*o=0.95 V, *E*1/2=0.86 V), as well as many reported carbon-based ORR electrochemical catalysts[3a,6b]

Figure 9b showed the LSV curves of the P-CNCo-3 catalysts in an O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH electrolyte within a rotating speed range of 400 to 2000 rpm. To investigate the ORR kinetics, the calculated electron transfer number was obtained from K L plots (Figure 9c). It can be observed from Figure 9d that the electron transfer numbers for P-CNCo-3 ranged from 3.89–3.98, suggesting that P-CNCo-3 performed catalysis on a four-electron reaction pathway.[18]

The stability of P-CNCo-3 and commercial Pt/C was tested via a 43200 s (12 h) chronoamperometric response. Figure 10a highlights that the current density losses for P-CNCo-3 and

commercial Pt/C are 12.7% and 27.8% respectively, suggesting that P-CNCo-3 has more stability compared to commercial Pt/C. Additionally, the tolerance to methanol crossover of P-CNCo-3 was further investigated. Compared with Pt/C, P-CNCo-3 experienced a negligible change after the introduction of methanol at 100 s (Pt/C), demonstrating that P-CNCo-3 possesses a robust stability in terms of methanol tolerance.

The electrocatalytic performance of as-synthesized catalysts and commercial Pt/C with respect to the OER was evaluated in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte. Figure 11a revealed the OER activities of catalysts under the current density of 10 mAcm <sup>2</sup> (*Ej*=10), which is a classic metric applicable for OER measurements. P-CNCo-3 exhibited a smaller overpotential under the current density of 10 mAcm <sup>2</sup> at 1.72 V, which is far more superior than other asprepared and Pt/C catalysts.[19] The reversible oxygen electrode activity was assessed based on the potential gap (Δ*E*) between *E*1/2 and *Ej*=10. [20] As expected, P-CNCo-3 generated the lowest Δ*E* of 0.83 V (Figure 11b), corroborating the assumption that P-CNCo-3 could be applied as an effective bifunctional oxygen catalyst for rechargeable metal-air batteries.

To realize the commercial application of P-CNCo-3 in alkaline media, Zn–air batteries (ZABs) were fabricated using P-CNCo-3 or commercial Pt/C as air electrode (Figure 12). The experimental results revealed that both the open circuit voltage (OCP: 1.46 V) and current density of ZABs with P-CNCo-3 exceed those with commercial Pt/C (OCP: 1.45 V) (Figure 12a). More importantly, the peak power density of P-CNCo-3 is 175.1 mWcm <sup>2</sup> , which is nearly 1.7 times that of commercial Pt/C (104.2 mWcm <sup>2</sup> ). Furthermore, P-CNCo-3 demonstrated the ability to obtain a higher voltage than commercial Pt/C when discharged at 5 mA or 20 mA, indicating a more optimal battery performance (Figure 12c). Besides, it also exhibits a high specific capacity of 791 mAhg <sup>1</sup> and energy density of 976 Whkg <sup>1</sup> at 20 mA, which is better the values elicited by Pt/ C (709 mAhg <sup>1</sup> and 879 Whkg <sup>1</sup> , respectively) and other M N C catalysts.[21]

## **Conclusion**

In summary, P-CNCo-n (n=0,1,3,9) micro-/mesoporous carbon was synthesized by pyrolysis of one-step PVP assisted BMZIF. The as-synthesis catalyst, demonstrated a homogeneous Co/N dual-doping and a hierarchical pore structure, thus exposing more active sites and facilitating the transport of oxygen. The experimental results delineated outstanding electrocatalytic performance for both ORR and OER, as well as higher stability and methanol resistance. The resultant catalyst Co N-doped micro-/mesoporous carbon nanospheres displayed extraordinary bifunctional electrocatalytic performance in the ORR and OER, even much superior than that of 20 wt% Pt/C. The efficiency of the assembled zinc-air battery implies that the designed catalyst possesses a promising application potential.

Abstract: To develop low-cost and efficient oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts, a novel hybrid comprising cobalt-embedded nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes and nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide (Co-NCNT/NrGO-800) was simply prepared by pyrolysis. The combination of nanotubes and graphene, and the efficient doping with cobalt and nitrogen, greatly contribute to the excellent ORR performance. This optimized Co-NCNT/NrGO catalyst exhibits a positive onset potential of 0.91 V and a half-wave potential of 0.82 V, combined with a relatively low peroxide yield, better durability, and better methanol tolerance than commercially available Pt/C, which makes it a promising candidate as a low-cost and effective non-precious-metal ORR catalyst.

## Introduction

With the increasingly severe energy crisis and consequent environmental problems, there is an urgent need to develop nextgeneration energy conversion and storage technologies.[1] The electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), which occurs at the cathode in fuel cells and metal–air batteries, is a key reaction to optimize the power output.[2] A catalyst is however

indispensable to achieve dioxygen reduction at lower overpotential, owing to its sluggish nature. Although platinum-based materials are known as the most efficient ORR catalysts, their weak durability, crossover effect, low earth-abundance, and high price hinder their widespread implementation.[3] The development of high-performance earth-abundant electrocatalysts has become one of most important targets of research in recent years.[4, 5]

Among various non-precious metal catalysts under investigation (for example, transition-metal compounds and heteroatom-doped carbons), metal-N-doped carbon (M-N/C; M=Co, Fe, etc.) hybrid materials are regarded as one of the most promising alternatives.[4, 6] A new generation of ORR catalysts has been developed in recent years.[7] Generally, simultaneous thermal treatment of any combination of nitrogen/carbon precursors and transition metals can yield M-N/C materials with some ORR activity.[6] Without precise control over compositions and structures, however, we cannot realize superior ORR catalysts.[6] Based on recent research, there are two key points in the research to realize high performance ORR catalyst: 1) gaining richer active sites to increase reaction availability, and 2) decreasing mass-transfer resistance to facilitate the ORR process.[8, 9]

Graphene with its high theoretical surface area and excellent electronic conductivity is attractive for meeting the aforementioned requirements. Recent reports have demonstrated that the introduction of heteroatoms (for example, N, P, S, B, and F) and active additives (for example, Fe, Co, Ni) can significantly improve its catalytic activity.[10–16] On the other hand, graphene tends to restack during the process of introducing active sites owing to strong van der Waals interactions. Previous work has demonstrated the fabrication of less aggregated and porous graphene through a hard-template-protected pyrolysis pro-

cess.<sup>[17]</sup> Methods of this type, however, require a multistep preparation process and yield catalysts with poor catalytic performance. An alternative strategy has been proposed based on the combination of one-dimensional (1D) carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with two-dimensional (2D) graphene to form a unique three-dimensional (3D) architecture.<sup>[18,19]</sup> Different approaches have been explored to fabricate unique three-dimensional graphene-based structures.<sup>[20–22]</sup> In a recent report, a surfactant-assisted method has also been developed, although the surfactant is a non-conductive organic molecule, which prevents smooth electron transfer.<sup>[23]</sup> More feasible synthesis methods remain to be explored.

In situ synthesis of carbon nanotubes is more convenient for fabrication of the aforementioned 3D architecture. Herein, we report the one-step synthesis of 3D structured ORR electrocatalyst consisting of cobalt-embedded, nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes and nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide (Co-NCNT/NrGO). N-doped carbon nanotubes formed in situ with active Co nanoparticles are evenly distributed on N-doped graphene to not only act as active sites, but also to efficiently prevent the graphene nanosheets from restacking and maximize the exposure of active sites. Owing to this smart 3D structure, efficient N heteroatoms and Co nanoparticles incorporation, our Co-NCNT/NrGO hybrid (treated at 800 °C) presents comparable ORR activity to commercial Pt/C, as well as good methanol tolerance and superior stability in alkaline solution.

#### **Results and Discussion**

The synthesis of Co-NCNT/NrGO is presented in Scheme 1. Initially, CoCl<sub>2</sub>·6 H<sub>2</sub>O and melamine, selected as the cobalt source

and the nitrogen source, respectively, are added to graphene oxide solution. The dissolved  $Co^{2+}$  and melamine are adsorbed on the graphene oxide surface through electrostatic interaction and conjugation effects to form a uniform mixture.<sup>[24]</sup> Subsequently, the powder obtained after drying at 45 °C is subjected to two consecutive annealing steps, in which the formation and decomposition of  $C_3N_4$  occur in sequence. In the first stage, polymerization from melamine to  $C_3N_4$ , with the  $Co^{2+}$  adsorbed on the graphene oxide (GO), is carried out with the release of N-containing species, which attack oxygen groups linked on the graphene oxide surfaces, resulting in the reduction of GO and nitrogen doping into the graphene framework, to give rise to  $Co-C_3N_4/NrGO.^{[25,26]}$  In the second annealing stage, the  $C_3N_4$  is decomposed, which is accompanied by the liberation of N-containing species, such as  $NH_3$  and  $C_5N_2.^{[25]}$  Fi-

nally, via the catalytic effect of the Co, Co-NCNTs are evolved on the NrGO sheets.  $^{[27]}$ 

The formation process has been investigated, as well as transformation process of the intermediate. GO exfoliated from stacked graphite was first confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD; Figure 1a). The peak observed at around 12° demonstrates the

incorporation of oxygen groups and enhanced interlayer spacing. [28] The intermediate Co-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>/NrGO shows layered morphology, as shown in the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images (Supporting Information, Figure S1). The formation of  $C_3N_4$  is verified by the strong XRD peak at 27.4° and the peak at 13.1° (Figure 1a). [29] On the other hand, the GO peak and the cobalt species are not detected clearly, due to their small content in the composite. Characteristic infrared (IR) peaks belonging to C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> are also clearly shown in Figure 1 b. The peaks at 1639 cm<sup>-1</sup>, 1558 cm<sup>-1</sup>, 1460 cm<sup>-1</sup>, and 1410 cm<sup>-1</sup> are attributed to stretching vibrations of heptazine-derived repeating units, while the bands at 1312 cm<sup>-1</sup> and 1234 cm<sup>-1</sup> are assigned to the stretching vibrations of connected units of C-N(-C)-C (full condensation) or C-NH-C (partial condensation).[30] Thus, the above data supports the formation of Co-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>/NrGO.

More information of Co-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>/NrGO can be obtained from the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis in Figure 1 c–e. At this stage, surface N content is recorded to be as

high as 15.76 at.%, which is caused by the N-rich composition of  $C_3N_4$ . The peak at 284.9 eV is assigned to the sp<sup>2</sup> C–C bond of graphene, and the peak at 286 eV originates from the C–N bond. Simultaneously, the peaks at 288.55 eV, 398.75 eV, and 400.1 eV can be ascribed to N–C=N, C–N=C, and N–(C)<sub>3</sub>, respectively, which is involved in the triazine rings. Furthermore, the weak peak at 781.5 eV belongs to Co–N<sub>x</sub>. [32]

Co-NCNT/NrGO hybrid can be prepared after the heat treatment of  $Co-C_3N_4/NrGO$ . The thermal behavior of  $Co-C_3N_4/NrGO$  was investigated by thermogravimetric (TG) analysis. As shown in Figure 1 f, the significant weight loss of 91.5% between  $600\,^{\circ}C$  and  $700\,^{\circ}C$  demonstrates the thermal decomposition process for  $C_3N_4$ . [26] Figure 2 shows the morphology of the Co-

NCNT/NrGO-800 sample (where 800 refers to the applied temperature). The representative scanning electron microscope (SEM) images show large-sized nanosheets and structures composed of entangled nanotubes (Figure 2a,b). The tubular structures distributed on the graphene sheets possess lengths ranging from several hundreds of nanometers to several micrometers and diameters of 10–30 nm. It is further revealed that Co nanoparticles are embedded inside the nanotubes in the TEM image (Figure 2c,d). The measured inter-plane spacing of the

core nanoparticle in the high resolution TEM (HRTEM) image is 0.21 nm (inset in Figure 2 d), which is in good agreement with the (111) planes of Co.<sup>[33]</sup> It is clearly observed that the carbon layers around the Co nanoparticles are graphitized, with measured inter-plane spacing of 0.34 nm, which has been proven to play an important role in the enhancement of the electronic conductivity.<sup>[34]</sup> The element distribution was also investigated through high-angle annular dark-field-scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM; Figure 2 e,f). The results show both N and C distribute evenly throughout the composite, thus supporting the formation of Co-NCNT/NrGO.

In obtaining the Co-NCNT/NrGO, the coexistence of a cobalt source and melamine is necessary for the formation of the tubular structures.[35,36] Here, several controlled experiments were carried out. The cobalt-embedded rGO (Co-rGO) sample prepared in the absence of melamine shows the sheet morphology of graphene with Co nanoparticles anchored on the sheets (Supporting Information, Figure S2a). On the other hand, the nitrogen-doped rGO (NrGO) sample prepared without a cobalt source shows only the crumpled sheet morphology (Figure S2b). From the above two experiments, the in situ formed Co particles catalytically decompose the N-containing carbon source, which releases from the C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>. At the same time, these carbon species move on the surface of the Co nanoparticles to grow carbon nanotubes.[27] Furthermore, to understand the role of GO, the cobalt-embedded nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (Co-NCNT) sample was prepared in the absence of GO (Figure S2c). As revealed by the TEM image, a few tubes with severe particle aggregation are observed. Thus, the introduction of GO is beneficial for the formation of uniform Co-NCNT/NrGO, because the GO sheets probably suppress the aggregation. The surface area of Co-NCNT/NrGO-800 (316.9 m<sup>2</sup>g<sup>-1</sup>) is around 10 times higher than that of Co-NCNT (34.6 m<sup>2</sup>g<sup>-1</sup>; Supporting Information, Figure S3). The high surface area of Co-NCNT/NrGO-800 is beneficial for exposure of active sites.[37]

It has been widely accepted that the performance of a catalyst is the result of several structural factors, not only the surface area, but also the degree of graphitization, and the N content and types.[38,39] The effects of annealing temperature on the physical and chemical properties of the Co-NCNT/NrGO samples were investigated. The precursors annealed at 700 °C and 900  $^{\circ}\text{C}$  give rise to similar hybrids, as displayed in the TEM images (Supporting Information, Figure S4), indicating that the annealing temperature does not have any influence on the morphology. Wide-angle XRD was used to verify the phase purity of the Co-NCNT/NrGO samples. As shown in Figure 3a, two diffraction peaks around 23° and 44.3° can be assigned to the (002) planes of graphite carbon and Co (111) planes (JCPDS No.15-0806), respectively, in all the samples.<sup>[40]</sup> No diffraction peaks of C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> can be detected, indicating that it has been completely decomposed. Raman measurements were then used to investigate the defects and disordered nature of the carbon in each sample. As shown in Figure 3 b, two distinct peaks located at 1384 cm<sup>-1</sup> and 1610 cm<sup>-1</sup> can be associated with the D band and the G band, respectively.[38] The integrated intensity ratio of these bands  $(I_G/I_D)$  is found to vary slightly

This indicates that the graphitic structure is enhanced as the pyrolysis temperature increases, which is beneficial for increasing the electrical conductivity of the derived carbon.<sup>[38]</sup>

XPS was carried out to examine the surface element composition (Figure 3 c–f and Table 1). The Co-NCNT/NrGO samples are mainly composed of C, N, and Co. The high-resolution C1s spectrum can be divided into two peaks, sp<sup>2</sup> C–C (284.6 eV) and C–N (285.7 eV) (Figure 3 d), which verifies the doping of N atoms within the carbon framework. [33] Deconvolution of the N1s region can yield three N species, pyridinic N (398.2 eV),

pyrrolic N (399.6 eV), and graphitic N (400.7 eV), respectively (Figure 3 e).[37] A comparison of the individual components in each sample is summarized in Table 1. The total N content is calculated to be 3.12 at.%, 4.85 at.%, and 1.41 at.% for Co-NCNT/NrGO-700, Co-NCNT/NrGO-800, and Co-NCNT/NrGO-900, respectively. The N content of the Co-NCNT/NrGO samples is clearly decreased when the applied temperature is above 800 °C. Furthermore, when the pyrolysis temperature is above 800 °C, pyridinic N and pyrrolic N decrease markedly, while the graphitic N shows relatively better thermal stability. On the other hand, with the increase of temperature, the surface content of Co decreases, which may be caused by breakage of Co-N<sub>x</sub> bonds, followed by the coalescence of Co particles (Table 1).[41] Deconvolution of the Co2p<sub>3/2</sub> region of the samples at different temperatures shows five peaks corresponding to metallic Co<sup>0</sup>, Co<sub>x</sub>O<sub>y</sub>, Co–C–N, Co–N<sub>x</sub>, and satellite, respectively (Figure 3 f).[32,42] The formation of Co<sub>v</sub>O<sub>v</sub> may be attributed to the surface oxidation of metallic Co in air. According to previous reports, the samples with a higher content of pyridinic N and Co-N<sub>x</sub> groups are expected to display better ORR performance.[42,43]

The ORR catalytic performance of the Co-NCNT/NrGO samples was evaluated by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) measurements performed on a rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) system. Our data indicates that Co-NCNT/NrGO catalyst obtained at 800 °C has better ORR performance than the other samples in terms of the onset potential and steady-state current density, which is probably due to the balance between the degree of graphitization and the bonding configuration achieved at this temperature. As shown in Figure 4a, Co-NCNT/NrGO-800 exhibits a more positive onset potential of 0.91 V and a higher catalytic current of 4.38 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> at 0.4 V, which is comparable with the performance of Pt/C. To study the catalytic pathways of the catalysts, the corresponding per-

oxide yield and the electron transfer number has been calculated, as presented in Figure 4 b,c. The peroxide yield of Co-NCNT/NrGO-800 is recorded to be less than 15.3% over the whole potential range, and it decreases to 6.0% at 0.8 V. The electron transfer number ranges from 3.69 to 3.87 over the measured potential range, suggesting that a four-electron pathway dominated the ORR process.[40] In the cases of Co-NCNT/NrGO-700 and Co-NCNT/NrGO-900, the calculated peroxide yields are less than 20% over the whole potential range, and the electron transfer numbers are around 3.7 in average. The ORR activity of Co-NCNT/NrGO-800 is higher or comparable to the reported noble metal-free electrocatalysts (Table S1), and it has been further validated by the small Tafel slope of 75 mV dec-<sup>1</sup> at low overpotential (Figure 4 d), which is close to that of Pt/C catalyst (71 mV dec-1 ). Therefore, the mechanism of ORR processes is quite similar to the Pt/C catalyst, and the transfer of the first electron is the main the rate-determining step of the ORR for the Co-NCNT/NrGO-800 catalyst.[38]

Furthermore, the structure–activity relationship was investigated by an ORR performance comparison among the rGO, Co-rGO, Co-NCNT, NrGO, and Co-NCNT/NrGO-800 samples. As revealed by the LSV curves (Figure 5 a), Co-rGO, Co-NCNT, and

NrGO exhibit much lower catalytic activity than Co-NCNT/ NrGO-800. The onset potential of Co-NCNT is 68 mV negative to that of Co-NCNT/NrGO-800, probably due to low accessible surface area caused by the severe particle aggregation. Simultaneously, the onset potential of NrGO is 72 mV negative to that of Co-NCNT/NrGO-800. LSV was conducted at various rotation rates on a rotating disk electrode (RDE) system to study the kinetics during the ORR reaction (Figure 5 b–d; Supporting Information, Figure S5). As calculated from the corresponding Koutecky–Levich (K-L) plot, the average electron transfer number of Co-NCNT/NrGO-800 is 3.88, which is in accordance with the RRDE method (Figure 4 b). In contrast, the electron transfer numbers of NrGO and Co-NCNT are in the range of 3.3–3.4, indicating a hybrid two-electron and four-electron transfer process.[44]

Thus, the introduction of NrGO is beneficial for the formation of the uniform Co-embedded N-doped carbon nanotube structure, and the NCNT formed in situ further prevents the NrGO sheets from restacking, thus facilitating the reactant diffusion and maximizing the active site exposure. It is expected that the synergy between the Co-NCNT and NrGO contributes to the improved ORR activity of Co-NCNT/NrGO-800. Additionally, the activity of Co-rGO composite shows higher catalytic activity in term of the diffusion-limited current and onset potential when compared with rGO. It is reasonable to infer that Co nanoparticles also make a certain contribution to improved ORR activity.[25, 28] As reported in the literature,[45, 46] active material particles partially encapsulated in carbon shells can activate the surrounding graphitic layers, which would increase their ORR performance. In our case, enhanced ORR catalytic activity has been achieved by preparing evenly distributed Co nanoparticles embedded in NCNT supported by NrGO.

Apart from activity, the stability and selectivity are the two key parameters for practical use. Therefore, Co-NCNT/NrGO-800 catalytic performance towards the ORR was then tested by chronoamperometry. In the stability test, although the currents of both Co-NCNT/NrGO-800 and Pt/C decrease with the increase in time, the Co-NCNT/NrGO-800 presents a much slower decay rate (Supporting Information, Figure S6 a), which demonstrates that the Co-NCNT/NrGO-800 electrode features superior stability than Pt/C. The electrocatalytic selectivity was investigated by adding 5 mL methanol into O2-saturated electrolyte at 500 s (Supporting Information, Figure S6 b). For Co-NCNT/ NrGO-800, only a slight response is observed when methanol is injected, while a significant current decrease is observed in the case of Pt/C that is presumed to be caused by methanol oxidation, suggesting better selectivity of Co-NCNT/NrGO-800 compared to Pt/C.

### Conclusions

In this study, a novel hybrid comprising cobalt-embedded nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes and nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide (Co-NCNT/NrGO) has been developed using cost effective sources and a simple pyrolysis process. In our strategy, rGO sheets has been introduced to facilitate the fabrication of the uniform 3D structure, and the NCNT induced by Co nanoparticles and formed in situ can act as a spacer to prevent the stacking of the graphene sheets. Owing to the smart structure, the exposure of the active sites can be maximized. Along with the efficient N heteroatoms and Co nanoparticle incorporation, the Co-NCNT/NrGO-800 hybrid materials exhibit comparable catalytic activity to Pt/C, but have much better durability and selectivity, which makes this composite a promising candidate as a low-cost and effective non-precious metal ORR catalyst.

In a typical preparation of graphene oxide (GO), 15 mg GO was ultrasonically dispersed in 25 mL  $\rm H_2O$ . Then, 5 mL  $\rm CoCl_2$ -6  $\rm H_2O$  solution (0.75 mg mL $^{-1}$ ) was added and stirred at room temperature for 1 h. Afterwards, 397 mg melamine was added into the solution and stirred well, and the temperature was then kept at 45 °C to allow the solvent to slowly evaporate. The resulting solid mixture was then collected and ground with a mortar and pestle. Finally, the homogeneous powder was calcined in two consecutive steps: 1) it was heated up to 550 °C at a rate of 10 °C min $^{-1}$  and kept at this temperature for 2 h under flowing nitrogen to form  $\rm Co-C_3N_4/NrGO$ , which was 2) further heated to elevated temperature (700 °C, 800 °C, and 900 °C) at a rate of 10 °C min $^{-1}$  and maintained at the selected temperature for 2 h to obtain  $\rm Co-NCNT/NrGO$ -800, and  $\rm Co-NCNT/NrGO$ -900, respectively).

For comparison, a series of samples were prepared in the absence of one component, while the conditions were otherwise kept constant. NrGO was prepared in the absence of a cobalt source. Co nanoparticles supported by reduced graphene oxide (Co-rGO) was prepared in the absence of melamine. Co-NCNT were prepared in the absence of GO. In a typical synthesis of thermally reduced graphene oxide (rGO), 15 mg of GO was directly transferred into a furnace for heat-treatment with the other conditions kept constant.

#### Characterization

The morphology and composition of the Co-NCNT/NrGO hybrid were characterized using a Hitachi H 9000 NAR transmission electron microscope (TEM). Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) data was collected using a Scintag XDS 2000 X-ray powder diffractometer operating at 40 kV, 40 mA with Cu K $\alpha$  radiation ( $\lambda = 1.5418$  Å). Raman spectra were collected using a Raman spectrometer with a 633 nm laser excitation (Renishaw 1000B). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed on an HP 5950A instrument with Mg K $\alpha$  as the source and the C1s peak at 284.6 eV as an internal standard. Typically, the XPS scanning involved 12 scans for the surface survey. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out using a TA SDT 2960 thermoanalyzer with a heating rate of 10°C min<sup>-1</sup> in nitrogen atmosphere. Nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherm measurements were performed on a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 to study specific surface area. Before analysis, the sample was pretreated by degassing at 120 °C for 12 h to remove any adsorbed species.

#### **Electrochemical tests**

All of the electrochemical measurements were carried out in a standard three-electrode cell working with a CHI 842c electrochemical workstation, in which Pt wire was used as the counter electrode, Ag/AgCl (3 M KCl) was used as the reference electrode, and glassy carbon as the working electrode. 0.1 M KOH was used as electrolyte. In the rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE) tests, a 5.6 mm diameter glassy carbon rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) with a Pt ring (geometric area 0.247 cm²) was used as the working electrode. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves were recorded from -1.0 to 0.2 V with a scan rate of 10 mV s<sup>-1</sup>. The rotation speed was fixed at 1600 rpm. The electron transfer number and the  $H_2O_2$  yield during ORR on the RRDE were determined by the equations given below [Eq. (1) and (2)]:

$$H_2O_2(\%) = 200 \times \frac{I_r/N}{I_r + I_r/N}$$
 (1)

$$n = \frac{4I_{\rm d}}{I_{\rm d} + I_{\rm r}/N} \tag{2}$$

where  $I_r$  is the ring current,  $I_d$  is the disk current, and N is the collection efficiency with a value of 0.37.

In the rotating disk electrode (RDE) tests, a 3 mm diameter glassy carbon rotating disk electrode (RDE) was used as the working electrode. LSV was performed at varying rotation speeds from 1600 rpm to 3600 rpm. The electron transfer number (*n*) involved in the reaction can be calculated using the Koutecky–Levich equation, which is expressed by [Eq. (3) and (4)]:

$$\frac{1}{J} = \frac{1}{J_d} + \frac{1}{J_k} = \frac{1}{B\omega^{1/2}} + \frac{1}{J_k} \tag{3}$$

$$B = 0.2 \, nFC_0(D_0)^{2/3} \nu^{-1/6} \tag{4}$$

Here J is the measured current density,  $J_{\rm d}$  is the diffusion-limited current density,  $J_{\rm k}$  is the kinetic current density,  $\omega$  is the electrode rotation speed, n is the overall electron-transfer number in oxygen reduction, F is the Faraday constant ( $F=96485~{\rm C\,mol}^{-1}$ ),  $C_0$  is the bulk concentration of  $O_2(C_0=1.2\times10^{-3}~{\rm mol\,L}^{-1})$ ,  $D_0$  is the diffusion coefficient ( $D_0=1.9\times10^{-5}~{\rm cm}^2~{\rm s}^{-1}$ ), V is the kinetic viscosity of the electrolyte ( $V=0.01~{\rm cm}^2~{\rm s}^{-1}$ ), and k is the electron-transfer constant. For the fabrication of the working electrode, 2.0 mg as-synthesized catalyst was mixed with 100  $\mu$ L Nafion solution and 900  $\mu$ L deionized water. For RDE tests, 5.0  $\mu$ L of the suspension was dropped onto the working electrode surface, while 10  $\mu$ L of the suspension was dropped onto the working electrode surface for RRDE measurements.

Before testing, flowing  $N_2/O_2$  gas was passed through the electrolyte for at least 20 min to saturate the electrolyte with  $N_2/O_2$ . For all of the experiments, the electrodes were cycled at  $100 \text{ mV s}^{-1}$  until reproducible cyclic voltammograms (CVs) were obtained. The electrode potentials measured versus Ag/AgCl were converted to reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE).

The onset potential is defined as the potential at which the ORR current is 5% of that measured at 0.4 V, considering that the diffusion-limited current is practically reached at that potential for all the catalysts discussed in this work.

A Three-Dimensionally Structured Electrocatalyst: Cobalt-Embedded Nitrogen-Doped Carbon Nanotubes/ Nitrogen-Doped Reduced Graphene Oxide Hybrid for Efficient Oxygen Reduction

Low-cost and efficient: A hybrid consisting of cobalt-embedded nitrogendoped carbon nanotubes and nitrogendoped reduced graphene oxide (Co-NCNT/NrGO-800) was prepared by

simple pyrolysis. The combination of nanotubes and graphene, and the efficient doping with cobalt and nitrogen, greatly contribute to the excellent oxygen reduction.

#### **Abstract**

Extensive investigations have been devoted to nitrogen-doped carbon materials as catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in various conversion technologies. In this study, we introduce nitrogen-doped carbon materials with hollow spherical structures. These materials demonstrate significant potential in ORR activity within alkaline media, showing a half-wave potential of 0.87 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). Nitrogen-doped hollow carbon spheres (N-CHS) exhibit unique characteristics such as a thin carbon shell layer, hollow structure, large surface area, and distinct pore features. These features collectively create an optimal environment for facilitating the diffusion of reactants, thereby enhancing the exposure of active sites and improving catalytic performance. Building upon the promising qualities of N-CHS as a catalyst support, we employ heme chloride (1 wt%) as the source of iron for Fe doping. Through the carbonization process, Fe-N active sites are effectively formed, displaying a half-wave potential of 0.9 V versus RHE. Notably, when implemented as a cathode catalyst in zinc-air batteries, this catalyst exhibits an impressive power density of 162.6 mW cm<sup>-2</sup>.

#### 1. Introduction

Fossil fuels have been identified as a significant contributor to air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, exacerbating the global climate crisis. To address this issue, there is an increasing focus on identifying and developing low-carbon and renewable energy sources, including solar power and hydrogen, as well as advancing energy storage and conversion technologies [1, 2]. In energy conversion processes, the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) plays a crucial role, as it determines the efficiency of

energy conversion devices. In an alkaline environment, the ORR can occur through two pathways [3]:

1.1. The direct four-electron (4-e) pathway

$$O_2 + 2H_2O + 4e^- = 4OH^-, E_0 = 0.404 V$$

1.2. The peroxide pathway

$$O_2 + H_2O + 2e^- = HO_2^- + OH$$
,  $E_0 = -0.065 V$ 

The given potentials are referenced to the standard state values relative to the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) at a temperature of  $25\,^{\circ}\text{C}$ .

Zinc-air batteries have become a cost-effective option for energy storage because of their outstanding energy density [4–6]. While the four-electron process offers higher power during energy conversion, its higher electrochemical energy barrier compared to the two-electron process leads to slower kinetics for the overall ORR [7]. Consequently, extensive research has been undertaken to explore potential catalysts that can enhance ORR activity.

Presently, the prevailing catalyst for ORR is platinum carbon (Pt/C) due to its exceptional catalytic activity. However, its properties as a noble metal with high cost and low storage capacity restrict its widespread application [8–10]. To overcome these limitations and discover inexpensive, readily available catalysts, researchers have focused on developing non-noble metal ORR catalysts. These include transition metal sulfides [11], transition metal/nitrogen doped carbon (M-N-C) materials [12–16], and heteroatom-doped nanoporous carbon materials [17]. Among these catalysts, heteroatom-doped nanoporous carbon materials exhibit promise as alternatives to precious metal catalysts owing to their remarkable catalytic activity, good electrical conductivity, and tunable electronic properties [18]. Nitrogen-doped carbon catalysts have garnered significant attention [19-23]. Nitrogen-modified carbon catalysts encompass various types such as nitrogen-modified graphene [24], nitrogen-modified carbon nanotubes. Nitrogen-modified carbon catalysts with high nitrogen concentration and well-dispersed nitrogen species exhibit excellent ORR activity. Nitrogen atoms introduce new active sites by altering the local ligand environment, such as pyridine nitrogen and pyrrole nitrogen [25-29].

Generally, the catalytic activity of the ORR is influenced by both kinetic and mass transfer processes. Facilitating contact between oxygen molecules in the bulk solution and the active centers is a critical step in achieving high current density. Graphene is a 2D structure composed of carbon atoms arranged through sp2 hybridization. The presence of van der Waals forces between the layers facilitates the formation of stacks. The stacking process significantly reduces the specific surface area of the material. This leads to a significant decrease in the availability of active sites and hampers efficient mass transfer [30]. These combined factors ultimately result in a decline in the catalytic activity of the catalyst for the ORR. Based on previous studies, it has been established that pore engineering, which involves modulating the pore architecture of carbon materials, can effectively increase the electrochemically accessible area and promote oxygen diffusion. Hence, the catalytic efficiency of porous carbon materials in the ORR is enhanced [31].

Here, we have successfully synthesized nitrogen-doped hollow carbon spheres (N-CHS) as an ORR catalyst using the hard template method. We utilize hollow carbon spheres (CHS) as a catalyst support, forming a catalyst with a thin carbon shell layer and a hollow structure. The unique hollow structure of the CHS allows for efficient electron and ion transport, as well as easy oxygen diffusion. These characteristics facilitate rapid movement of reactants to and from the active sites during the reaction. Additionally, the abundant mesopores within the carbon shell layer provide numerous

attachment sites for nitrogen, thus increasing the number of active sites in the catalyst. The resulting N-CHS catalyst demonstrates impressive ORR activity in a 0.1 M KOH solution, achieving a half-wave potential of 0.87 V. Remarkably, this value is comparable to the 0.89 V of the Pt/C catalyst. Taking inspiration from Huang *et al*, who used metal complexes and corroles to create highly dispersed single-atom catalysts [32], we prepare FeN-CHS using the metal complex chlorin heme as the iron source and N-CHS as the support. As a result, the FeN-CHS reaches a half-wave potential of 0.9 V. Through the exploration of nitrogen-doped carbon materials with hollow spherical structures, this study contributes to the ongoing quest for novel catalysts in energy conversion devices.

#### 2. Experimental section

#### 2.1. Materials and methods

Analytical-grade chemicals and solvents from reputable suppliers (Aladdin, Alfa Aesar, Macklin Biochemical Technology Co. Ltd., Admas-beta, and Sinopharm Chemical Co. Ltd.) were utilized without additional purification. The Pt/C catalyst (20 wt%) was procured from Johnson Matthey Corp, and a 5% w/w Nafion solution in water was sourced from Alfa Aesar.

#### 2.2. Synthetic procedures

2.2.1. Synthesis of RF/SiO<sub>2</sub>. To synthesize RF/SiO<sub>2</sub> (here, the 'RF' means resorcinol-formaldehyde resin) (diameter ~124 nm), a typical procedure involves adding 3 ml (49.0 mmol) of 32 wt% ammonia solution to an ethanol/ water mixture (80 ml, ethanol/water volume ratio = 7). The solution produced by this process, known as solution A, is stirred at a temperature of 30 °C for half an hour. Following this, ethyl orthosilicate (TEOS), in a volume of 3.5 ml (16 mmol), is incrementally added to solution A, resulting in the creation of solution B. Then, resorcinol (0.4 g, 3.6 mmol) and formaldehyde (0.56 ml, 7.2 mmol) are added to solution B at intervals of 10 min, all the while maintaining continuous stirring for a period of 24 h. After this process, a solid product is obtained through centrifugation, then cleaned with both water and ethanol. It is then mixed into 80 ml of deionized water. In the final step, this mixture is rapidly frozen using liquid nitrogen before being dried using a freeze dryer.

2.2.2. Synthesis of CHS and CS. At first,  $700 \,\mathrm{mg}$  of RF/SiO<sub>2</sub> is weighed and heated to  $700\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  ( $5\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}\,\mathrm{min}^{-1}$ ) in an N<sub>2</sub> environment kept for 2 h. The process results in a carbonized product known as C/SiO<sub>2</sub>, which is then dissolved in a 4 M sodium hydroxide solution. A comparison sample of solid carbon spheres (CS) is synthesized following the same steps, excluding the use of tetraethyl orthosilicate and alkaline etching.

2.2.3. Synthesis of N-CHS and N-CS. Initially, 25 g of urea was measured and placed into a large crucible. The crucible

was then heated in a muffle furnace at a rate of 10 °C per minute and held at 550 °C for 3 h, which resulted in a light yellow and porous g-C3N4 material. Subsequently, 250 mg of the g-C3N4 and 20 mg of CHS were precisely measured and added to 15 ml of isopropanol. This mixture was sonicated for 2 h to achieve uniform dispersion. Afterwards, the mixture was dried at 80 °C and carbonized at 900 °C (at a rate of 10 °C per minute for an hour) in a nitrogen environment to facilitate nitrogen doping. For comparison purposes, nitrogendoped solid carbon spheres (N-CS) were also synthesized following the same procedure, with CS substituted for CHS.

2.2.4. Synthesis of FeN-CHS. In this procedure, 20 mg of N-CHS was dispersed in 30 ml of anhydrous ethanol, forming solution A, and was then sonicated for 2 h. Concurrently, solution B was created by dissolving 2.34 mg (1 wt%) of heme chloride in 10 ml of ammonia. Solution B was subsequently added to solution A, which was then sonicated for an additional 30 min. The combined mixture was dried at a temperature of 60 °C, then carbonized at a rate of 10 °C per minute up to 900 °C within a nitrogen environment, and this was sustained for 2 h. This final step resulted in the production of FeN-CHS.

## 3. Results and discussion

In this study, N-CHS was fabricated using the synthetic approach depicted in figure 1(a). The approach involved the utilization of a hard template method to synthesize CHS with a hollow structure. Following this, a heat treatment was applied to convert the CHS into N-CHS [[33](#page-9-0)]. Initially, silica particles with electronegative surfaces were generated through the hydrolysis of TEOS in an alkaline solution containing ammonia. The presence of NH4<sup>+</sup> ions on the silica surface, induced by the electrostatic effect, facilitated the formation of a homogeneous colloidal solution. Simultaneously, resorcinol and formaldehyde underwent slow condensation to form a resin known as resorcinol-formaldehyde (RF). The RF resin could then interact electrostatically with the NH4+-covered silica particles, resulting in the coalescence of RF on the silica surface, yielding a complex referred to as RF/SiO2. High resolution transmission electron microscope (HR-TEM) images, shown in figure 1(b), provide a detailed view of the solid structure inside the RF/SiO<sub>2</sub> material. The material exhibits uniform morphology, with an average diameter of around 120 nm (figure S1(a)). The HR-TEM analysis also reveals that the RF cladding layer has a thickness of about 7 nm (figure S1(b)). After carbonizing and selectively etching SiO<sub>2</sub> with sodium hydroxide, CHS were formed, as visible in the HR-TEM images. These CHS show a clear hollow structure, with an average diameter of approximately 119 nm (figure S1(c)). Further inspection shows that the carbon shell layer encasing the hollow spheres is around 4.85 nm thick (figure S1(d)).

During the annealing process, the RF layer thickness decreased. After treating the CHS support with g-C3N4 as a nitrogen source, N-CHS were produced. HR-TEM images show that the nitrogen doping process had little effect on the CHS structure, maintaining an average N-CHS diameter of around 120 nm (figure S1(e)). The average thickness of the carbon shell layer of these hollow carbon spheres is approximately 5.96 nm (figure S1(f)).

As a control, CS were synthesized using the same procedure, but without adding TEOS. The CS showed an average diameter of approximately 550 nm. Subsequent heat treatment produced N-CS. The HR-TEM images of N-CHS and N-CS are shown in figures S2(a) and S2(b). Furthermore, the use of high angle angular dark field-scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) and elementary mapping images (figures S2(c) and S2(d)) confirmed the even distribution of nitrogen atoms throughout the CHS and CS materials.

The structure and pore size distribution of the samples were evaluated using N<sub>2</sub> adsorption-desorption isotherms at 77 K (see figures 1(c) and (d)). According to the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) classification, both N-CHS and CHS displayed type IV isotherms, marked by H1-type hysteresis loops at  $P/P^0 \approx 1$ . This suggests a consistent diameter of straight mesopores evenly dispersed throughout the carbon shell layer of CHS. However, the isotherms for N-CS and CS exhibited type I characteristics in the low-pressure range, indicative of high micropore adsorption, and an absence of hysteresis loops in the midpressure range, which suggests a significant presence of micropores in CS. The isotherms for N-CHS and N-CS mirrored those of CHS and CS, respectively, implying that the nitrogen doping process did not significantly alter the pore structures of CHS and CS. More detailed N<sub>2</sub> adsorptiondesorption isotherms for N-CHS, N-CS, CHS, and CS are outlined in table 1.

Data from table 1 reveals that the specific surface area  $(S_{\rm BET})$  of N-CHS is roughly twice that of N-CS, indicating a larger surface area for N-CHS. Moreover, the ratio of microporous surface area to total surface area  $(S_{\rm Micro}/S_{\rm BET})$  for N-CHS is about 8%, compared to 61% for N-CS. This significant difference suggests that N-CHS has fewer micropores than N-CS. The presence of mesopores and macropores in the carbon layer of N-CHS accounts for its larger non-microporous surface area. This increased surface area in N-CHS provides more binding sites for nitrogen atoms, thereby improving the efficiency of the catalyst.

|       | $S_{BET}$ | $S_{Micro}$ | $S_{\text{Micro}}/S_{\text{BET}}$ | $V_{\text{Micro}}$ | $V_{Micro}/V_{total}$ |
|-------|-----------|-------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| N-CHS | 746       | 62          | 8%                                | 0.029              | 0.72%                 |
| N-CS  | 378       | 230         | 61%                               | 0.161              | 41.39%                |
| CHS   | 836       | 75          | 9%                                | 0.033              | 1.02%                 |
| CS    | 543       | 344         | 63%                               | 0.142              | 40.90%                |

Moreover, the ratio of micropore volume to total pore volume  $(V_{\text{Micro}}/V_{\text{total}})$  is approximately 0.72% for N-CHS and around 41.39% for N-CS. This significantly smaller V<sub>Micro</sub>/V<sub>total</sub> ratio for N-CHS compared to N-CS implies a lesser presence of micropores within the hollow structure of N-CHS, while N-CS has a substantial proportion of micropores in its overall volume. When considering the pore volumes of both N-CHS and N-CS, the greater volumes in N-CHS indicate larger pore size and deeper channels. This particular structure enhances the diffusion of reactants into the interior of the pores. Consequently, the hollow structure and thin carbon shell layer of N-CHS are more beneficial for reactant transportation and diffusion compared to the solid microporous structure of N-CS. Furthermore, the pore structure of N-CHS facilitates electrolyte wetting of the internal pore walls, enlarging the electrochemical active area (ECSA). This results in improved active site utilization and subsequently increases the catalytic activity of N-CHS.

Raman spectroscopy was utilized to evaluate defects and graphitization of the nitrogen-doped carbon materials. The Raman spectra of N-CHS, N-CS, CHS and CS are displayed in figure S3. Figure 2(a) displays the full width at half maximum (FWHM) measurements of the D and G peaks for N-CS, N-CHS, CHS, and CS, as well as the ratio  $(I_D/I_G)$  of the D and G peaks. The D peak signifies the extent of defects and disorder in the carbon material, meanwhile, the G peak originates from the in-plane stretching vibration of carbon atoms undergoing sp2 hybridization, which is indicative of graphitic carbon. The FWHM values of N-CS and N-CHS in figure 2(a) show minimal difference. The  $I_D/I_G$  ratio, which indicates the level of defects in graphitic carbon materials, is higher for N-CS and N-CHS compared to CS and CHS, respectively. The observed elevation in the  $I_D/I_G$  ratio can be ascribed to the nitrogen doping process, which introduces a higher number of defects into the material. Figure 2(b) displays the powder x-ray diffraction (XRD) diffractograms of N-CHS, N-CS, CHS, and CS, revealing distinct peaks at 21.2° and 43.3° for N-CHS and N-CS, respectively, these peaks can be assigned to the crystallographic planes of graphitic carbon, namely the (002) and (101) planes, respectively.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) served as an analytical tool to examine the chemical composition and valence states of the N-CHS and N-CS surfaces, with particular attention given to the nitrogen species present. The XPS spectra of N 1 s for N-CHS and N-CS underwent rigorous fitting analysis, resulting in the identification of four

The region of interest in figure 2(d) represents two distinct chemical bonds: C-C & C=C (approx. 283–285 eV) and C-O & C=O (approx. 285.5–289 eV).

nitrogen states at specific binding energies: 398.3 eV, 400.0 eV, 401.05 eV, and 403.0 eV. These nitrogen states were identified as pyridine-N, pyrrole-N, graphite-N, and pyridine nitrogen oxide, respectively (figure 2(c)) [34]. The diverse nitrogen species exhibit distinct influences on the electronic states of the adjacent carbon atoms, thereby influencing the electrocatalytic performance exhibited. Pyridine nitrogen possesses hybridized lone pairs, enabling strong electron-donating capabilities and abundant Lewis sites. Consequently, nitrogen-doped catalysts enriched with pyridine nitrogen species often demonstrate superior electrocatalytic performance in the ORR. Figure S4 presents the content of pyridine nitrogen species in N-CHS and N-CS, which is approximately 40.5% and 41.4%, respectively. It can be observed that both catalysts exhibit similar levels of pyridine nitrogen species.

XPS can provide insights into the defect concentration and oxygen group content of materials. The defect concentration is often evaluated using the ratio of C–C & C=C, with a higher ratio signifying a greater defect concentration. As depicted in figure 2(d), the spectra for both N-CHS and N-CS largely coincide within the C–C & C=C spectral range (283–285.5 eV). This suggests that the defect concentrations in these materials are comparable. However, within the 288–290 eV range, N-CHS displays a more pronounced C–O&C=O ratio than N-CS, indicating a higher oxygen content. This increased oxygen content in N-CHS may be due

to the presence of aliphatic O-C or aromatic O-C bonds [35]. The coherence between the XPS results and the outcomes from the Raman spectroscopy and XRD analyses supports this observation.

The rich mesoporous and hollow structure of the carbon shell layer in N-CHS plays a crucial role in its catalytic performance for ORR. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was employed to assess the catalytic performance of N-CHS and compare it with that of Pt/C (20%) catalysts. (figures S5-S8). Under an inert gas (N<sub>2</sub>) environment, the CV curves of N-CHS, N-CS, and Pt/C all exhibited quasi-rectangular shapes without sharp oxidation or reduction peaks. In the given experimental setup with a 0.1 M KOH solution saturated with O<sub>2</sub>, both N-CHS and N-CS exhibited oxygen reduction peaks, indicating their active participation in ORR. Moreover, the abundant mesoporous and hollow structures within the CHS contribute to an increased active area, consequently enhancing the catalytic activity of the material towards ORR.

N-CHS exhibits good performance in the linear scanning voltammetry (LSV) test. The limiting diffusion current densities for N-CS and N-CHS are 5.03 and 6.18 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, respectively (figure 3(a)). The onset potentials of ORR for N-CS and N-CHS are 0.926 and 0.956 V, respectively, demonstrating a shift towards higher positive potentials with the transition from solid to hollow carbon spheres and from undoped to nitrogen-doped catalysts. A similar trend is

<span id="page-6-0"></span>**Figure 3.** (a) LSV polarization curves. (b) Tafel slope curves of Pt/C, N-CHS and N-CS in O<sub>2</sub>-saturated electrolytes under the conditions of a sweep rate of 5 mV s<sup>-1</sup> and a rotation speed set at 1600 rpm. (c) LSV polarization curves of after ADT 10000 cycles, after ADT 5000 cycles and the initial LSV polarization curves of N-CHS, respectively.

observed in the half-wave potentials, with N-CS exhibiting a value of 0.80 V and N-CHS demonstrating a higher value of 0.87 V. Despite the resemblance observed between N-CHS and N-CS when subjected to Raman spectroscopy, XPS, and various other characterization methodologies, N-CHS and N-CS display significantly different ORR catalytic performances. This divergence can be ascribed to their distinct structural properties. During the reaction process, the mesoporous structure of N-CHS, facilitates the diffusion of reactants to the active sites more effectively than N-CS, which is abundant in micropores. Additionally, the hollow structure of N-CHS further reduces ion diffusion distance and improves ion response rate, enhancing its electrocatalytic performance [36]. N-CHS demonstrates a marginally lower performance compared to commercially available Pt/C electrocatalysts. However, N-CHS still outperforms most reported metal-free electrocatalysts (table S1).

The Tafel slope provides valuable insights into the rate-determining step and reaction kinetics. As illustrated in figure 3(b), the Tafel slope of N-CHS is  $50.0 \text{ mV dec}^{-1}$ , less than N-CS ( $59.2 \text{ mV dec}^{-1}$ ) and Pt/C ( $56.4 \text{ mV dec}^{-1}$ ), indicating that the high  $S_{\text{BET}}$  and abundant mesoporous structure of N-CHS facilitate reactant transport and diffusion during the reaction [37]. In contrast, the poor catalytic performance of N-CS can be ascribed to its solid structure containing a greater number of unfavorable microporous

structures for reactant diffusion. In terms of reaction pathway, the 4-e process is more desirable as it achieves a more complete reaction with higher catalytic efficiency. The LSV (figure S9) curve obtained using rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) confirms that the number of electron transfers for N-CHS during the entire reaction is greater than 3.9, indicating dominance of the 4-e process. Furthermore, the yield of  $H_2O_2$ , a by-product of the ORR, for N-CHS is less than 4%. Meanwhile, the assessment of accelerated durability test (ADT) (figures 3(c) and (d)) reveals the good stability of N-CHS.

The relaxation time constant  $(\tau)$  indicates the level of resistance to ion transport within porous structures [38]. In the case of N-CHS, the  $\tau$  value (figure 4(a)) is 0.28 s, which is smaller than that of N-CS (0.39 s). This indicates that N-CHS has a lower kinetic diffusion resistance, allowing for faster ion transport. Faster ion transport can reduce voltage loss in the system, particularly at high current densities. The ECSA refers to the effective surface region engaged in the chemical reaction, with a larger value indicating a greater presence of active sites participating in the reaction. Figure 4(b) shows that N-CHS has a larger ECSA of 9.3 mF cm<sup>-2</sup> compared to N-CS (2.1 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>). This significant difference can be ascribed to the structural traits of N-CHS, specifically its thin shell-layered hollow carbon spheres with a high density of mesoporous structures. The mesopores in N-CHS have larger

<span id="page-7-0"></span>Figure 4. (a) The capacitance's imaginary part (Cim) of N-CHS and N-CS. (b) Comparison of ECSA between N-CHS and N-CS.

pore sizes and shallower depths compared to the microporous structures found in N-CS. These mesoporous structures provide more favorable conditions for the diffusion and transport of reactants. Additionally, the large pore walls in the mesopores offer more attachment sites for nitrogen (N). During the reaction, these mesoporous structures are readily wetted by the electrolyte, effectively activating the N attachment sites and enhancing the catalytic performance of N-CHS in the ORR [39]. Therefore, the exceptional ORR catalytic performance of N-CHS would be ascribed to its distinctive characteristics, such as the thin shell layer and hollow structure with abundant mesoporous features. These structural attributes facilitate ion transport, reduce resistance, and provide a larger number of active sites. Ultimately, this enhances the catalytic performance of N-CHS.

The ORR is a crucial stage in energy storage and conversion devices such as fuel cells and metal-air cells. Despite the fact that Fe-based transition metal-nitrogen-doped carbon (Fe-N-C) catalysts have emerged as promising alternatives to noble metal catalysts, the search for suitable supports that can provide ample active sites remains challenging. Here, N-CHS was identified as a highly suitable support, exhibiting excellent catalytic performance for FeN-CHS. To create the Fe-modified nitrogen-doped carbon catalyst, N-CHS was utilized as a support to adsorb heme chloride, and the mixture was subsequently pyrolyzed in a nitrogen gas atmosphere. The XRD spectrum of FeN-CHS (figure S10) revealed only characteristic peaks of carbon, indicating the absence of iron crystals or oxides in FeN-CHS. Moreover, the HR-TEM image of FeN-CHS (figure S11(a)) clearly shows the hollow structure characteristics of N-CHS. As shown in figure S11(b), the HAADF-STEM image demonstrated the uniform distribution of Fe atoms and the absence of metal clusters in the sample. It can also be seen that the doping process did not significantly affect the morphology of the support. These findings emphasize the robust structural integrity of N-CHS and its aptness as a support material.

XPS was employed to analyze the elemental composition of the FeN-CHS material. The full scan spectrum of FeN-CHS (figure S12) exhibited peaks corresponding to Fe, N, C, and the presence of O. The presence of oxygen could be ascribed to atmospheric  $O_2$  adsorption on the material surface or carboxyl

groups carried by heme chloride. The C 1 s spectrum of FeN-CHS (figure S13) revealed the presence of five distinct peaks at specific binding energies: 284.9 eV, 285.6 eV, 286.8 eV, 289.1 eV, and 290.2 eV. These peaks can be ascribed to the chemical species C-C, C=C, C-O, C=O, and the  $\pi$ - $\pi$ \* satellite, respectively. The N 1s spectrum (figure S14) was analyzed through deconvolution, revealing four distinct peaks at 398.4 eV, 399.7 eV, 401.0 eV, and 402.9 eV, which correspond to Pyridine N, Fe-N, Graphitic N, and Oxidized N, respectively. The presence of Fe-N bonded peaks signifies the successful creation of stable Fe-N active sites within the porous structure. Additionally, the presence of a characteristic peak in the Fe 2p spectrum (figure S15) after pyrolysis confirms the effective doping of Fe into the carbon framework of N-CHS. These XPS findings provide valuable insights into the elemental composition of FeN-CHS.

We evaluated the electrocatalytic performance of FeN-CHS using CV curves in alkaline solutions saturated with  $\rm O_2$  and  $\rm N_2$  gases, as depicted in figure 5(a). No significant redox peaks were observed in the  $\rm N_2$ -saturated electrolyte. However, when in an  $\rm O_2$ -saturated electrolyte, FeN-CHS exhibited prominent reduction peaks, reaching performance levels near those of Pt/C.

LSV curves were obtained for Pt/C and FeN-CHS in an  $O_2$ -saturated 0.1 M KOH solution. As illustrated in figure 5(b), FeN-CHS presented a half-wave potential of 0.90 V, surpassing the corresponding value of 0.89 V for Pt/C. The Tafel plot, as seen in figure 5(c), indicated a smaller slope for FeN-CHS (50.43 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>) compared to that of Pt/C (56.40 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>). These observations suggest that the superior kinetic process in FeN-CHS can be attributed to its unique combination of a hollow structure and a thin layer of mesopore-rich carbon shell.

In order to evaluate the practical viability of FeN-CHS as a cathode material, Zn–Air cells were assembled (figure 5(d)). Commercial Pt/C was utilized as a benchmark for comparison purposes. The characterization test results demonstrated that FeN-CHS is suited for zinc-air batteries, delivering high power density and performance, surpassing that of commonly used commercial materials. These findings position FeN-CHS

as a strong contender for alternative commercial materials in various applications.

Overall, the experimental results provide insights into the ORR performance of FeN-CHS, which can be summarized as two key points. First, the hollow structure of N-CHS, combined with a mesopore-rich carbon shell, exposes a greater number of active sites. This design enhances the transport of reactants to these sites during the reaction, thereby promoting more efficient catalytic activity. Second, the incorporation of Fe introduces active Fe-N sites into the carbon framework. Collectively, these elements contribute to the improved ORR catalytic performance observed in FeN-CHS.

#### 4. Conclusions

In summary, we have successfully synthesized two distinct carbon-based materials, N-CHS and N-CS, aiming to satisfy the urgent demand for non-noble metal catalysts in the ORR. This was achieved through careful regulation of TEOS and g-C3N4 additions, which served as nitrogen sources, in the hard template method. Once the silica template was removed, we noticed that, compared to N-CS, N-CHS exhibited a rich mesoporous structure. The distinct hollow structure of N-CHS, along with its relatively thin walls and plentiful mesopores within the carbon shell, enhanced substance diffusion and ion transport during the ORR process. As a consequence, N-CHS exhibited superior electrocatalytic activity and exceptional durability compared to N-CS. The mesoporous structure of N-CHS, coupled with the cooperative effect of Fe-N active sites, contributes to a synergistic impact, leading to a remarkable enhancement in the catalytic performance of ORR. Furthermore, this study offers a valuable reference for the design of ORR catalysts, particularly from the viewpoint of support structure.

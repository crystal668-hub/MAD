Due to the high catalytic activity and stability for oxygen reduction reaction, N-coordinated Fe Cu dual-metal doped carbon material (FeCu N C) is considered to be one of the promising electrode materials for metal-air battery and fuel cells. Herein, FeCu N C dual-metal catalysts was synthesized by an adsorption-calcination strategy. The prepared FeCu N C exhibited high activity and stability both in alkaline and acidic media. In alkaline/acid medium, the half-wave potential reaches to 0.90/0.80 V, which is better than Fe N C catalyst. The power density for FeCu N C in zinc-air battery reaches to 220 mWcm <sup>2</sup> and shows high electrochemical stability for more than 600 hours in charge/discharge cycles, much higher than 130 hours for Pt/C (40%) and 100 hours for Fe N C. Densityfunctional theory calculations showed that the FeCu N C dualmetal catalysts got lower overpotential of 0.50 V than Fe N C (0.53 V), which improved the ORR activity. The results are helpful for the deep understanding of high-performance diatomic catalysts.

## **Introduction**

Zn-air batteries and Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) are attractive devices for sustainable energy conversion. The activity and stability for cathodic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts are at the heart of this technology.[1,2] Currently the best performing electrocatalysts are still dominated by Platinum-based catalysts.[3,4] In order to reduce the cost and improve their sustainability, non-precious metal catalysts and metal-free catalysts have been studied extensively in an attempt to replace Pt-based catalysts.[5,6,7,8] Among them, metal-doped nitrogen-coordinated transition metal atoms catalysts (M N C, M=Co, Fe, Ni, Cu …) are considered to be the most potential substitutes for precious metal catalysts due to their low cost, high activity and high durability.[9,10,11,12] Among them, iron and nitrogen co-doped carbon materials (Fe N C) are considered to be the most promising catalysts to replace platinum-based catalysts for their high activity and fourelectron selectivity in both acidic and alkaline conditions.[13] However, the ORR stabilization of Fe N C in alkaline media is not as good as that of Pt-based catalysts.[14] Therefore, the topic for enhancing Fe N C in alkaline media has become a hot topic.

Previous experimental and theoretical studies showed that the main reasons for ORR activity are effective ORR active sites and synergistic effects between different active centers.[15,16,17,18]

Therefore, it is an effective way to improve the ORR performance of Fe N C by introducing the second type of transition metal atom. Previously, it has been shown that the order of ORR activity of nitrogen-doped carbon materials is Fe*>*Co*>* Cu*>*Mn*>*Ni.[19] In order to promote ORR activity, researchers have constructed a series of diatomic sites catalysts such as FeN4 CoN4, FeN4 MnN4 and CoN4 MnN4 which have greater ORR potential than that of Fe N C for accelerating electron transfer rate and optimizing adsorption intermediates.[20,21] Currently, the bimetallic CuFe N C was reported to have better ORR activity than monometallic Cu/Fe N C catalysts due to the interaction between Cu and Fe in the catalysts.[22,23] For example, the bimetallic CuFe N C catalyst made by Kang et al.,[24] exhibited higher ORR activity than Pt/C and other monometallic Cu(Fe) N C catalysts in 0.1 M KOH.[23] FeCuN7 catalysts reported by Zhang[25] shows excellent durability and outstanding ORR catalytic activity in alkaline and neutral medium and provide superior discharge performance in Mg-air and Zn-air batteries. Therefore, the activity and stability of FeCu N C catalyst in zinc-air batteries need to be further improved, and its inherent original activity needs to be further studied. There is still room for improving the catalytic activity and stability of bifunctional FeCu N C catalysts.

Herein, a high performance FeCu N C catalysts is prepared by adsorbed Fe and Cu ions on pre-carbonized ZIF-8 nanoparticles (NPs) and heated at 900 °C. The prepared FeCu NC catalysts exhibits high ORR electrocatalytic performance with half-wave potential (E1/2) of 0.91 V and onset potential (Eonset) of 1.00 V, much better than commercial Pt/C (40%) (E1/2 of 0.85 V, Eonset of 1.00 V) and Fe N C (E1/2 of 0.87 V, Eonset of 0.9 V). FeCu N C catalysts in Zinc-air batteries with power densities up to 220 mWcm <sup>2</sup> , and specific capacities of 760 mA/h·g <sup>1</sup> zn, in charge/discharge cycles more than 600 h, outperformed Pt/C (40%) and Fe N C catalysts. DFT calculations on FeCu N C catalysts shows that FeCu N C got lower formation energy (Ef ) and lower overpotential than Fe N C catalysts. The experimen-

tal and theoretical results both showed the higher ORR activities and stability for FeCu N C catalysts.

#### **Preparation of FeCu N C**

Due to the high specific surface area, the formation of negative zeta potential for the host after pre-pyrolysis at 650°C and the advantage to absorb metal atoms into the host,[26] ZIF-8 was chosen as a pre-substrate for Fe N C and FeCu N C (supporting information for the details of synthesis process supporting information for the details of synthesis process). The synthesis process of FeCu N C is shown in Scheme 1. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the prepared ZIF-8 (Figure S1) was consistent with the literature.[27] FeCu N C and Fe N C as well as their precursors present homogeneous rhombic dodecahedral particles with the size of about 150 nm (Figure 1a and Figure S2). The fabricated NC, Fe N C and FeCu N C have an amorphous structure as shown in Figure 1f. The high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images of FeCu N C/Fe N C in Figure 1b, EDS elemental mapping in Figure 1c, 1d, 1e and Figure S3, show the uniformly distributed Cu, Fe and N elements on carbon NPs, no metal particles was presented, which is consistent with the XRD results in Figure 1f, suggesting the adsorbed Fe and Cu ions were not agglomerated during the high temperature treatment process. The content of Fe and Cu in FeCu N C were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry is 0.63 wt% and 0.26 wt%, respectively (ICPMS, Table S1). For parallel comparison, the corresponding Fe N C was treated under the same conditions.

The surface composition and valence states of FeCu N C were investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), the detected species and their contents were similar to those of Fe N C, except for the additional introduction of Cu (Figure 1g and Table S2, Supporting Information). The ratio of N increased after Cu and Fe co-doping into N/C suggesting the formation of Cu N and Fe N fraction in the FeCu N C (Figure S4 and Table S2). The Fe 2p peaks in FeCu N C (Fe<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> peaks (710.4 and 723.3 eV) and Fe3<sup>+</sup> peaks (713.6 and 727.0 eV) negatively shifted comparing to that of Fe N C (Fe2<sup>+</sup> peaks (710.7 and 723.6 eV) and Fe<sup>3</sup><sup>+</sup> peaks (714.8 and 728.2 eV)) suggesting that the Cu provides electrons to Fe,[28,29] as shown in Figure 1h and Figure S5 and S6.

X-ray absorption spectroscopy, including X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy, was performed to further investigate the local atomic configuration around Iron and copper in FeCu N C. The near-side absorption position of the Fe K edge of FeCu N C is shifting to lower energies comparing to that of Fe N C, which suggests the decreased iron oxidation state in FeCu N C (Figure 2a). The result is consistent with the XPS results. The near-edge absorption spectrum of the K-edge of Cu in FeCu N C is higher in energy than that of the K-edge in Cu foil, which indicates the non-zero valence state of Cu (Figure 3b). The Fourier transform EXAFS (FT-EXAFS) in Figure 3d and 3e shows that FeCu N C and Fe N C have a main peak around 1.4 Å, which could be assigned to Fe N coordination,[30,31] and the absence of Fe Fe peak (Fe-foil) rules out the existence of Fe NPs or clusters in the two samples. In addition, the positions of absorption XANES spectra at the Fe and Cu K edge for FeCu N C and Fe N C are far away from Fe/Cu-foil spectrum. These results indicate that the Fe and Cu elements are automatically dispersed in FeCuNx species in Fe/Cu N C. According to the EXAFS fitting results in R space (see Figure 2c, 2f and Table S3), the optimized Fe N and Cu N coordination numbers are both close to 4.0 in the first shell of the samples. The fitting results of Fe N C are similar to that of Fe Cu-N C as shown in Figure S7 and Table S3. In addition, the wavelet transform (WT) contour plots of Fe N C and FeCu N C for the Fe N path in the Fe K-edge reference and FeCu N C for the Cu N path in the Cu K-edge reference are quite different from the results of Fe and Cu foils, indicate the automatically dispersed Fe and Cu atoms, and excluded the Fe and Cu nanoparticles[32,33] (Figure 2g, S8a and S8b).

#### **Electrochemical Performance and Battery Measurements**

The ORR electrochemical properties of FeCu N C, Fe N C and Pt/C (40%) were measured by the rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE) technique in O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH. The FeCu N C exhibits high ORR electrocatalytic performance with half-wave potential (E1/2) of 0.91 V and onset potential (Eonset) of 1.00 V, much better than commercial Pt/C (40%) (E1/2 of 0.85 V, Eonset of 1.00 V) and Fe N C (E1/2 of 0.87 V, Eonset of 0.9 V) in Figure 3a. The excellent ORR activity of FeCu N C might be attributed to

additional active sites and the synergistic effect between Fe and Cu atoms. Moreover, the FeCu N C exhibits a lower tafel slope than Pt/C (40%) and Fe N C (Figure 4b) and shows higher kinetic performance than Pt/C (40%) and Fe N C. The electron transfer number measured by the RRDE of FeCu N C is closer to 4.0 (Figure 3c). The H2O2 yields rate of the FeCu N C is below 5% over the potential window from 0.2 V to 0.8 V, lower than that of Pt/C (40%) and Fe N C (Figure 3c). The FeCu N C only lost a current density of 19% within 10000 s test in chronocurrent measurement, which is more superior than Fe N C (30%), demonstrating the high ORR stability than Fe N C (Figure 3d). In acidic environment, the FeCu N C exhibits high E1/2 of 0.8 V, which is comparable to that of commercial Pt/C (40%) (E1/2 of 0.8 V) and much higher than Fe N C (E1/2 of 0.75 V) in Figure 4e, but its stability is not as good as that of Fe N C (Figure S9). In acidic media, the hydrogen peroxide yield and tafel slope of FeCu N C are not as good as that of Pt/C (40%) in Figure S10 and S11.

To investigate the potential of FeCu N C in real Zn-air batteries, a rechargeable zinc–air battery with FeCu N C on porous carbon paper as air cathode and Zn foil as the anode are assembled. The results showed a high open-circuit voltage of 1.48V (Figure S12) and a maximum power density of 220 mWcm <sup>2</sup> and the series connected two batteries lit up an LED lamp with a rated voltage of 3.0 V (Figure 3f and S13). In addition, the FeCu N C-based battery delivers a higher specific capacity than the battery assembled by Pt/C (40%) and Fe N C catalyst (760 mA/h·g <sup>1</sup> zn for FeCu N C, 700 mA/h·g <sup>1</sup> zn for Pt/C (40%) and 740 mA/h·g <sup>1</sup> zn for Fe N C, as shown in Figure 3g). The discharging capacity of FeCu N C, Pt/C (40%) and Fe N C Zn–air batteries at different current densities are tested in Figure 3h, which further demonstrated the advantages of FeCu N C as an electrocatalyst. Even at a high current density of 50 mAcm <sup>2</sup> , the voltage still has high stability performance. In Figure 3i, the FeCu N C shows high electrochemical stability for more than 600 hours in charge/discharge cycles, much

higher than 130 hours for Pt/C (40%) and 100 hours for Fe N C. Comparing with Pt/C (40%) and Fe N C catalysts, the prepared FeCu N C catalyst shows more excellent performance in zinc-air batteries.

#### **Theoretical Calculations of Active Site**

In order to gain insight into the FeCu N C and Fe N C ORR activities, density functional theory (DFT) calculation was employed to investigate the original activity of the catalysts. The calculation models for FeCu N C and Fe N C are obtained from the fitting results of EXAFS in Figure 2c, 2f and S7. The proposed FeCu N C (Figure S14) model has a lower formation energy of 0.12 eV than Fe N C ( 0.09 eV) suggesting that a more stable structure was obtained when the Fe and Cu codoped into N/C. The possible ORR reaction schematic diagram is presented in Figure 4a, and the corresponding Gibbs free energy diagrams of ORR elementary steps are shown in Figure 4b and Table S5. From Figure 4b, it can be seen that the rate limiting steps (RDS) for FeCu N C in Fe site and Fe N C are the steps of the formation of OOH\* (O2+\*+H<sup>+</sup> +e ! OOH\*) and the formation of H2O (OH\*+H<sup>+</sup> +e !H2O (l)+\*), the corresponding <sup>~</sup>G is 0.72 and 0.70 eV, respectively. FeCu N C (Fe site) has a lower overpotential (0.50 V) than Fe N C (0.53 V). Therefore, FeCu N C is theoretically having higher electrochemical activity than Fe N C, the result is consistent with the above experiment results. During Structure optimization, the adsorbed O and OH on Cu atoms would spontaneously move to the Fe site. Therefore, Cu is not a direct reaction site in the catalysts. The total density states (TDOS) of FeCu N C and Fe N C are calculated in Figure 4c. The Fe-3d orbital in FeCu N C has a more broaden window ( 8.31–3.48) than that in Fe N C ( 7.48–3.83), suggesting that the Cu atom can induce electron redistribution on Fe center in the catalysts, which could break the localization of Fe 3d orbitals and accelerate the electron transport.[34] The asymmetric electron redistribution of FeCu N C configuration can result in polarization-distributed surface charges, thus contributing to the optimized adsorption/desorption behavior of oxygen intermediates, and enhancing the ORR performance.[35] According to the d-band center theory, when Cu is introduced into the FeNx moiety, the downward shift in Fe d-orbital center from 1.04 eV to 1.35 eV (Figure 4c) could optimize the absorption-desorption behavior of ORR intermediates and thus facilitate the rate-limiting step and finally decrease the overall reaction free energy.[36] The charge density difference pattern (Figure 4d and Figure S15) shows that more charges are transferred to the substrate after the construction of Fe Cu atomic pairs in FeCu N C, thus improving the catalytic activity of the catalyst. Therefore, it can be concluded by DFT calculation results that the synergistic interactions between Fe and Cu

species can break the localization of Fe-3d orbitals and accelerate the electron transport, thus facilitate the ORR process.

# **Conclusions**

In summary, bimetallic FeCu N C are fabricated through thermally fixing Fe and Cu atoms on N/C derived from carbonized ZIF-8. Experimental and theoretical results demonstrate that the synergistic effect between Fe and Cu sites enhances the activity of the catalysts. FeCu N C catalyst exhibits higher ORR activity with an E1/2 of 0.91 V and Eonset of 1.00 V in alkaline media, much better than Fe N C (E1/2 of 0.87 V, Eonset of 0.9 V) and Pt/C (40%) (E1/2 of 0.85 V, Eonset of 1.00 V). The Zn-air batteries adopt with FeCu N C catalysts outperformed the Pt/C (40%) based batteries, especially in charge/discharge cycles more than 600 hours. DFT calculations demonstrated a lower overpotential of 0.50 V than Fe N C catalysts (0.53 V), which explained the original activities of the catalysts. This encouraging activity improvement represents a critical step in developing viable diatomic atomic transition metal-N C catalysts for the Zn-air batteries.

**Abstract:** It is a great challenge to fabricate highly efficient pH-universal electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Herein, a facile strategy, which includes coating the Fe modified ZIF8 on Cu foil and in situ pyrolysis to evaporate and dope Cu into the MOF derived carbon, is developed to fabricate Fe/Cu N co-doped carbon material (Cu/Fe NC). Profiting from the modulated electron distribution and textual properties, well-designed Cu/Fe NC exhibits superior half-wave potential (*E*1/2) of 0.923 V in alkaline, 0.757 V in neutral and comparable 0.801 V in acid electrolytes, respectively. Furthermore, the ultralow peroxides yield of ORR demonstrates the high selectivity of Cu/Fe NC in full pH scale electrolytes. As expected, the self-made alkaline and neutral zinc-air batteries equipped with Cu/Fe NC cathode display excellent discharge voltages, outstanding peak power densities and remarkable stability. This work opens a new way to fabricate highly efficient and pH-universal electrocatalysts for ORR through strategy of Fe/Cu N co-doping, Cu foil evaporation and carbon defects capture.

# **Introduction**

The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is the key process in metal-air batteries (MAB),[1] alkaline fuel cells (AFC),[2] microbial fuel cells (MFC) and proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC).[3] The sluggish kinetics of the multi-electrons transfer path in ORR[4] greatly impedes the performance and efficiency of these electrochemical energy devices. Although traditional Pt-based electrocatalysts are featured with attractive ORR activity in alkaline and acidic aqueous,[5] further efforts are still needed to exploit alternative electrocatalysts that are more cost-effective, show longer-term durability and show comparable or even better activity than Pt-based catalysts for ORR. Currently, transition metals (Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Mn) with heteroatom-doped (N, P, S) carbon-based ORR catalysts, especially Fe N C materials, have been intensively investigated and deemed as promising ORR electrocatalysts.[6] The encouraging performance of Fe N C is commonly attributed to the elongated bond and reduced cleavage energy of dioxygen coupling with active sites of graphitic-N, pyridinic-N and FeN*x*. [7]

Besides the above modulation of intrinsic properties, the enhanced accessible active sites and abundant micro-meso pore structure are also necessary to further improve Fe N C activity based on fast electron and mass transfer effect.[8] A typical porous Fe N C material (Fe N C-NH3), featuring convenient mass transfer structure, was prepared through combination of silica template and NH3-assisted pyrolysis.[9] The prepared hollow shell Fe N C-NH3 realizes the high utilization of Fe N*<sup>x</sup>* sites, but its half-wave potentials (*E*1/2) of 0.85 V, 0.65 V and 0.65 V, respectively, in alkaline, acidic and neutral medium are still more negative as compared with those of Pt/C. The inferior performance is related to the oversized average pore width (nearly 30 nm), which could cause lower density of active sites. Similarly, a three-dimensional N-doped carbon-based Fe N C catalyst (FeNC D) was also prepared by a SiO2 confined strategy.[10] The prepared FeNC D shows a higher *E*1/2 than Pt/C in alkaline (0.87 V vs. 0.84 V) due to optimal textual structure of lower pore width (about 7.7 nm) and larger pore volume (1.34 cm3 /g). However, its *E*1/2 in acidic electrolyte is still inferior to commercial Pt/C (0.75 V vs. 0.82 V), while the half wave potentials of FeNC D and Pt/C are both lower than 0.7 V (0.69 V and 0.63 V) in neutral media. Additionally, the template removing steps or toxic and corrosive NH3 post-treatment procedures involved in these preparation methods are complicated and time-consuming.[11] Therefore, it is highly desirable to develop a facile strategy to fabricate pH-universal and high-

performance Fe–N–C electrocatalysts that possesses well-designed pore structure and abundant highly active and accessible sites.

Zeolite-imidazole frameworks (ZIFs), especially ZIF8, is one of the subclasses of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), featuring regular pore structure, rich metal-N coordination configuration, and easy evaporation of Zn during high temperature pyrolysis. As a result, ZIF8 is widely investigated to prepare template free, nitrogen doping, defective and porous carbon materials for ORR. [12] Adsorbing Fe species in the ZIF8 micropores or partially replacing Zn sites during the growth of ZIF8 is commonly carried out to fabricate Fe doped ZIF8 (Fe-ZIF8), [13] which is regarded as the optimal precursor for the production of porous Fe-N-C. Furthermore, doping Fe-N-C with the second metal species, especially copper, has also been investigated recently to improve ORR activity of Fe-N-C materials.[14] However, to further introduce of Cu into the Fe-ZIF8 easily leads to the coordination competition among  $Zn^{2+}$ ,  $Fe^{2+}/Fe^{3+}$  and Cu<sup>2+</sup> during the nucleation and crystallization of MOF, tending to cause irregular distortion of ZIF structure.[14c,15] To avoid the disadvantages of liquid phase synthesis method, recently, a few papers report the strategy that thermally induces migrating of manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel and copper atom from the corresponding metal plates or metallic compounds at high temperature to in situ introduce the second metal doping.[16] Whereas, there are few reports of similar methods to fabricate Fe-Cu co-doped ZIF8 derived carbon with excellent ORR activity in the electrolyte of full pH scale.

In this work, we fabricate a highly efficient pH-universal ORR electrocatalyst of Fe-Cu co-doped MOF derived porous carbon (Cu/Fe-NC) by a facile method, which contains the preparation of Fe-ZIF8 in water media and the in situ pyrolysis of Fe-ZIF8 on commercial copper foil to introduce Fe and Cu respectively. During the pyrolysis of Fe-ZIF8, evaporation of Zn from the MOF derived carbon generates abundant N-doped defects to capture the volatilizes from copper foil. The prepared Cu/Fe-NC exhibits a conductive carbon skeleton, hydrophilic interface status, extremely large specific surface area (1503 m<sup>2</sup>/g), abundant pores, high defect degree and multiple configurations of N-species (graphitic-N, pyridinic-N and M-N<sub>x</sub>). It is highlighted that the Cu/Fe–NC exhibits superior ORR activity to Pt/C ( $E_{1/2}$ ,  $0.923\,V$  vs.  $0.872\,V$  and  $0.757\,V$  vs.  $0.656\,V$  in alkaline and neutral electrolyte, respectively), and comparable activity in acid electrolyte (0.801 V vs. 0.832 V). Remarkably, Cu/Fe-NC exhibits ultralow average percentage of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> yields (1.1%, 2.4%) and 0.2%) in alkaline, acidic and neutral electrolyte, respectively, realizing catalysis in full pH scale electrolytes. Particularly, it achieves almost complete 4-electron transfer pathway of ORR. Moreover, a self-made Cu/Fe-NC based zinc-air battery exhibits higher output voltage as compared with those of Pt/C based battery (1.36 V vs. 1.30 V and 1.23 V vs. 1.11 V at 10 mA·cm<sup>-2</sup>) and higher power density (212 mW⋅cm<sup>-2</sup> vs. 175 mW⋅cm<sup>-2</sup> and 118 mW⋅cm<sup>-2</sup> vs. 92 mW⋅cm<sup>-2</sup>) in alkaline and neutral condition. This strategy of introducing Cu source through thermotriggering volatilization and carbon defects capture provides a creative avenue for developing economic, convenient, template-free and pH-independent ORR electrocatalysts.

#### **Results and Discussion**

#### Morphology and structure characterization

As shown in Scheme 1, Fe-ZIF8 is prepared by simply stirring  ${\rm Zn}({\rm NO_3})_2 \cdot 6{\rm H_2O}$ , EDTA-Fe, melamine and dimethylimidazole in water media. The obtained carambola-like Fe-ZIF8 particles is applied to coat the surface of commercial Cu plate and then the as prepared Fe-ZIF8/Cu is in situ pyrolyzed to obtain the final Cu/Fe–NC product. During the pyrolysis process, the generated defective sites on ZIF8 derived carbon is beneficial to capturing Cu volatile and anchoring Cu&Fe species.

As shown in Figure 1a and 1d, Fe-ZIF8 particles with a size around  $5 \sim 10 \ \mu m$  exhibit a smooth surface and carambola-like structure with a length of several microns and a thickness around hundreds of nanometers. At the same time, the XRD of Fe-ZIF8 exhibits typical crystallinities and similar topology structure to 2D leaf-like ZIF (ZIF-L) (Figure S1), indicating Fe-ZIF8 is successfully synthesized by a secondary crystal growth process.<sup>[17]</sup> After high temperature pyrolysis (1000 °C), the final Cu/Fe-NC keeps similar morphology but features with wrinkled surface (Figure 1b and 1e). The element mapping scanning result in Figure 1g exhibits that elements of C, N, Cu and Fe are evenly dispersed. The micro-structure of Cu/Fe-NC was further investigated by TEM as shown in Figure 1c, indicating some nanoparticles with size around 20~30 nm are surrounded by graphitic shells in carbon matrix. As shown by the magnified HRTEM image in Figure 1f, the lattice distance of core and shell areas are 0.209 nm and 0.345 nm corresponding to metallic Cu (111) and graphite (002) facets, respectively, indicating the encapsulation of Cu nanoparticles in carbonaceous structure.

To elucidate the effect of Fe and Cu on the morphology of Cu/Fe–NC, the results of SEM for Fe–N–C, Cu–N–C and N–C are

shown in Figure S2. Obviously, the Fe-N-C which was carbonized without Cu foil shows a similar rough surface and carambola-like morphology. In comparison, both Cu-N-C and N-C are featured with stacked and aggregated particles, indicating that Fe component plays a vital role for keeping carambola-like morphology. Additionally, XRD was further performed to verify crystalline structure as shown in Figure 2a. All these samples exhibit broad peaks around 26° corresponding to the (002) plane of graphitic carbon (PDF 41-1487). Both Cu-N-C and Cu/Fe-NC exhibit Cu crystal phase (PDF 04-0836), fully corroborating that Cu nanoparticles are successfully introduced by thermally inductive migration, which is well matched with HRTEM results. It is worth noting that although crystalline Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (PDF 19-0629) in Cu/Fe-NC and Fe-N-C is always regarded as an inconsistent role in previous studies, [18] we believe that the viewpoint of iron oxide enhancing the hydrophily of electrocatalyst is acceptable. [19] As shown in Figure S3, the contact angle of different electrocatalysts demonstrates that Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-containing Cu/Fe–NC and Fe–N–C have a stronger wetting nature than that for Cu-N-C and N-C. This result implies that Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> based samples have a positive effect to improve ORR activity. Furthermore, Raman spectra of Cu/ Fe-NC, Fe-N-C, Cu-N-C and N-C all exhibit two broad peaks near 1354 cm<sup>-1</sup> and 1589 cm<sup>-1</sup>, which are attributed to D band and G band (Figure 2b) belonging to the local defects or

disorders and in-plane stretching vibration of  $\rm sp^2$  hybridization in graphitic structure, respectively. The higher intensity ratio of D band to G band ( $I_{\rm D}/I_{\rm G}$ ) usually represents more defective configuration on carbon materials. As mentioned above, the defective sites on carbon benefit to capturing Cu volatile and anchoring Cu and Fe species. The  $I_{\rm D}/I_{\rm G}$  increases in the following order: N–C, Cu–N–C, Fe–N–C and Cu/Fe–NC, which means that in this order, metal species are trapped by more and more defects or vacancies in micro-porous structure of bi-metal doped material. Moreover, the conductivity of the four materials was evaluated by a four-point probe tester. Result shows Cu/Fe–NC has better electronic transmission than Fe–N–C, Cu–N–C and N–C (Figure S4).

The  $N_2$  isothermal adsorption and desorption test was performed to analyze pore texture of Cu/Fe–NC, Fe–N–C, Cu–N–C and N–C. In Figure 2c, all the adsorption isotherms present an type I(b) curves, which depict the pores are featured with identical micropore structure. Comparing with Cu–N–C and N–C, the Cu/Fe–NC and Fe–N–C exhibit apparent H4 type hysteresis in a medium relative pressure of 0.4 to 0.8, demonstrating the existence of a larger fraction of narrow slit mesopores. Based on the classical BET method, the calculated specific surface area (SSA) of Cu/Fe–NC is 1503 m²/g, which is larger than those of Fe–N–C (919 m²/g) and Cu–N–C (1333 m²/g), but relatively smaller than that of N–C (1731 m²/g).

Furthermore, as shown in Figure 2d, it is clearly depicted that the Cu/Fe–NC exhibit not only intensive distribution of micropore (d < 2 nm), but also intensive distribution of mesoporous between 2 to 5 nm. In comparison, the pore width of Cu–N–C and N–C are mainly located in a of range less than 2 nm (micropore region). As indicated in Table S1, Cu and Fe dual doping promotes a significant increase in the percentages of microporous SSA (78.1%) and microporous volume (48.5%). Those typical meso-pores and abundant micro-pores in Cu/Fe–NC are expected to enhance mass transfer and exposure of more accessible active sites for ORR. [18b]

#### Chemical environment characterization

To further elucidate the chemical composition and coordination environment of Cu/Fe–NC, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurement was performed. The survey spectrum and elements content of Cu/Fe–NC are exhibited in Figure 3a and Table S2, demonstrating the successful doping of Fe, Cu and N into the carbon matrix. The high-resolution spectrum of Fe 2p and Cu 2p<sup>3/2</sup> are shown in Figure 3b. In detail, The Cu 2p<sup>3/2</sup>

signals of Cu/Fe-NC is deconvoluted into Cu(0) or Cu(I)-N<sub>x</sub>/O<sub>v</sub> (931.9 eV) and Cu(II)-N<sub>x</sub> (936.1 eV), implying the existence of active Cu nanoparticles and Cu-N<sub>x</sub> (exclude that lattice oxygen according to Figure S5). [14c,d,23] The Fe 2p<sup>3/2</sup> of Cu/Fe-NC is deconvoluted into three peaks located at 710.1, 712.2 and 716.0 eV, corresponding to Fe(II), Fe(III) and the satellite peak, respectively. [14c,23b] Obviously, the peaks of Fe(III) 2p<sup>1/2</sup> and Fe(II) 2p<sup>1/2</sup> in Cu/Fe-NC shift in lower banding energy direction as compared with Fe-N-C because of the introduction of Cu to transfer electrons from Cu to Fe. Similarly, the peak of Cu(II) 2p<sup>3/</sup> <sup>2</sup> in Cu/Fe–NC shifts to a higher energy value as compared with Cu-N-C due to the introduction of Fe to accept electrons from Cu. It is the electron transfer that optimizes kinetics and electron motivation of ORR. [14d,23b,24] In Figure 3c, the highresolution N 1s spectrum of Cu/Fe-NC can be deconvoluted into pyridinic-N (398.7 eV), M-N<sub>x</sub> (M is Cu or Fe, nearly 399.9 eV), pyrrolic-N (401.3 eV), graphitic-N (402.3 eV) and oxidized-N (404.7 eV). It is observed that the binding energy of M-N<sub>x</sub> in Cu/ Fe-NC exhibits a negative shift of 0.12 eV and positive shift of 0.15 eV as compared with Fe-N-C and Cu-N-C, respectively, which indicates Cu species donor electrons to N<sub>x</sub>-Fe configuration and Fe species withdraw electrons from Cu-N<sub>x</sub> sites.

Herein, the abbreviations from N1 to N5 represent pyridinic-N, M-N<sub>x</sub>, graphitic-N, pyrrolic-N and oxidized-N respectively.

Profiting from above electronic mobility of  $Cu \rightarrow Fe$ , local electron transfer may have occured, which further attract intermediates of ORR. [14d,25] In addition, the  $Cu/Fe \rightarrow NC$  possesses the highest fraction of  $C \rightarrow N$  according to C 1s deconvolution (17.05%, Figure S6) and the highest total fraction of active N dopants (62% from pyridinic-N,  $N \rightarrow N$  and graphitic-N) among the four materials (Figure 3d and Table S3), which is attributed to the modulation of micro-meso porous structure to be beneficial for N coordination and configuration. [18b,26]

#### Electrochemical ORR performance and resource of active sites

The ORR activity of Cu/Fe–NC in  $O_2$  saturated 0.1 M KOH electrolyte was evaluated by RRDE system. In Figure 4a, Cu/Fe–NC exhibit the most positive onset potential ( $E_{onset}$ , 1.002 V) and half-wave potential ( $E_{1/2}$ , 0.923 V), which are greatly superior to those of the recently reported Cu and Fe co-doped catalysts (Table S4) and commercial Pt/C catalyst ( $E_{onset}$ , 0.981 V and  $E_{1/2}$ , 0.872 V). As shown in Figure S7, the CVs of Cu/Fe–NC present a more positive reduction peak than those contrastive

catalysts, further depicting its outstanding ORR activity. Besides, the Cu/Fe-NC are featured with larger double layer capacitance  $(C_{dlr} 30.6 \text{ mF} \cdot \text{cm}^{-2})$  as compared with the single Fe or Cu doped catalysts in Figure S8. As depicted in Figure 4b and Table S5, the average percentage of HO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> based on RRDE test for Cu/ Fe-NC is only 1.12% and its electron transfer number (n) is as high as 3.98, displaying a 4e<sup>-</sup> pathway of ORR in alkaline media. Furthermore, the similar electron transfer number (3.99) by K-L plot with different rotation rates and slight hydrogen peroxide yields (3.12%) based on UV-vis adsorption spectra method are certainly verifying the good 4 electron selectivity of Cu/Fe-NC (Figure S9 and Figure S10). In Figure 4c, Cu/Fe-NC displays the most positive potential (>0.9 V) at the same current range, and the smallest Tafel slope of 76.9 mV/dec, which reflect its highest intrinsic kinetics of ORR. As summarized in Figure 4d, the Cu/ Fe–NC shows both the highest  $E_{1/2}$  and kinetic current density  $(J_k$ , 30.8 mA·cm<sup>-2</sup>) at 0.85 V, demonstrating the improved kinetics of ORR for Cu/Fe-NC. It is highlighted that stability of electrocatalyst is crucial for developing noble-free materials with long lifespan. As shown in Figure 4e, Cu/Fe-NC shows an ignored change (0.9%) of current density in chronoamperomet-

ric response at 0.5 V, while Pt/C shows obvious activity decay about 27%. Furthermore, Cu/Fe-NC displays almost consistent LSVs curves before and after i-t test, but Pt/C exhibit decreased  $E_{1/2}$  and  $j_L$ . The good stability of Cu/Fe–NC is ascribed to the encapsulated Cu nanoparticles and metal-N<sub>x</sub> in carbon structure with high surface area and abundant porous structure, which prevents active sites from migration, degradation, and dissolution.[27] In Figure S11, Cu/Fe-NC exhibits a stable current with only a slight fluctuation after injection of 1 M methanol, reflecting its strong methanol tolerance than Pt/C.

It is well known that SCN<sup>-</sup> anion can poison Fe/Cu-N<sub>x</sub> moieties of the active sites for ORR in M-N-C material.[14c,19] As shown in Figure 4f, the  $E_{1/2}$  of Cu/Fe–NC has a negative shift about 20 mV and the j<sub>l</sub> also reduces significantly after addition of 10 mM SCN<sup>-</sup> into electrolyte, while N-C shows no change in  $E_{1/2}$  and  $j_L$ , indicating the superiority with respect to the existence of metal-N<sub>x</sub> sites in Cu/Fe–NC. After etching by Fe<sup>3+</sup>, Cu/Fe–NC exhibits a 30 mV negative shift of  $E_{1/2}$  and decline of j<sub>1</sub>, which demonstrates the Cu species also act as the active sites for ORR. Importantly, after Fe and Cu related phases are eliminated by strongly acid leaching, the  $E_{1/2}$  of Cu/Fe–NC significantly decreases about 80 mV which is higher than the sum of potential decay resulting from SCN<sup>-</sup> poisoning and Fe<sup>3+</sup> etching (Figure S12 and Figure S13), verifying that the synergistic effect of Fe and Cu species plays an important role in the outstanding Cu/Fe-NC activity towards ORR. For XPS results in section 3.2, Fe, Cu and N co-doped could adjust the electronic distribution and electron transfer (Cu-Fe). Therefore, inhibiting electron transition would happen in the absence of Cu/Fe-N<sub>x</sub>. To further verify our viewpoint, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed to reveal electron transfer

ability of interface. In Figure S14, Cu/Fe-NC exhibits significantly lower charge transfer resistance ( $R_{ct} = 12.6 \ \Omega \cdot \text{cm}^2$  in Table S6) as compared with Fe–N–C (140.9  $\Omega \cdot \text{cm}^2$ ) and Cu-N-C (219.1  $\Omega \cdot \text{cm}^2$ ).

In addition, ORR activity of the Cu/Fe-NC prepared at different temperatures was also investigated as shown in Figure S15 and summarized in Table S7. With increasing temperature from 800 to 1000 °C, the prepared Cu/Fe-NC exhibits positive shift of both  $E_{1/2}$  in LSVs and  $E_{peak}$  in CVs. However, Cu/ Fe-NC-1100 exhibits poor ORR activity, which may be related to burying and sintering of active sites at excessively high temperature, which is verified by the highly intensive diffraction peaks of metal components in XRD patterns (Figure S16) and the broken carbon structure in SEM image (Figure S17). Notably, the Tafel slope, peroxide yield and charge transfer ability by various calcination treatments all match well with above tendency, indicating 1000°C is the proper temperature to obtain optimal activity of Cu/Fe-NC.

In this section, we further investigated the ORR performance of the Cu/Fe-NC, Fe-N-C, Cu-N-C, N-C and 20 wt% Pt/C in both acidic and neutral electrolytes. As shown in Figure 5a and 5e, Cu/Fe–NC exhibits the  $E_{1/2}$  of 0.801 V in acidic medium, comparable to Pt/C (0.832 V), and 0.757 V in neutral media, much higher than that of Pt/C (0.656 V). Meanwhile, the comparison between Cu/Fe-NC and the recently reported Cu or (and) Fe (co) doped catalysts in 0.1 M HClO<sub>4</sub> and neutral electrolyte (pH=7) is also shown in Table S8 and Table S9. As depicted in Figure S18, Cu/Fe-NC also exhibits higher potential of reduction peaks of CV curves in both acid and neutral electrolytes than contrastive materials, reflecting its outstanding activity independent of pH. Considering the higher  $C_{dl}$  values of

Cu/Fe-NC in acid and neutral media (Figure S19 and Figure S20), optimal ORR performance should be associated with the extended active surface areas. The Figure 5b, 5f shows the highest electron transfer number (n) and the lowest percentage of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> yield of Cu/Fe–NC among Fe or Cu doped materials. Specifically, Cu/Fe–NC shows very high average n values of 3.95 and 3.99, and ultralow average H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> yields of 2.4% and 0.2% in acid and neutral electrolyte than most of Fe or (and) Cu (co-) doped materials, respectively (Table S10, Table S11 and Figure S21), indicating the 4e<sup>-</sup> pathway of ORR on Cu/Fe-NC prevails in wide potential and pH range. Additionally, the stability test as shown in Figure 5c and 5 g exhibits that Cu/ Fe-NC features with long-term operability in a wide pH scale. The enhanced kinetics of ORR on Cu/Fe-NC are also proved by the small Tafel slopes and high intrinsic kinetics current densities (J<sub>k</sub>, 42.1 and 25.6 mA·cm<sup>-2</sup>) in acid and neutral electrolytes as shown in Figure 5d, Figure 5h and Figure S22, respectively. Meanwhile, Cu/Fe-NC exhibits lower charge transfer resistance than Pt/C (Figure S23 and Table S12), confirming the excellent intrinsic property of Cu/Fe-NC.

#### Application of a zinc-air battery

Furthermore, we evaluated the performance of Cu/Fe–NC as electrocatalyst of oxygen diffusion cathode by using a self-made zinc-air battery (ZAB). In Figure 6a, the open circuit voltage of Cu/Fe–NC based ZAB is as high as 1.56 V, which is superior to that of Pt/C ZAB (1.48 V). Moreover, Cu/Fe–NC assembled ZAB delivers a higher and more stable discharge voltages as compared with Pt/C ZAB at different current densities from 1 to 100 mA·cm<sup>-2</sup> (Figure 6b). As depicted in Figure 6c, Cu/Fe–NC assembled ZAB exhibits higher discharge

voltage at full current range and higher maximum power density (212 mW·cm<sup>-2</sup>) than those of Pt/C assembled ZAB. Besides, the Cu/Fe-NC based ZAB shows a specific capacity of 784.3 mAh $\cdot$ g<sup>-1</sup> at 10 mA $\cdot$ cm<sup>-2</sup>, which is equal to 95.1% theoretical capacity of 824.6 mAh $\cdot$ g<sup>-1</sup> (Figure 6d). In addition, after modifying the Cu/Fe-NC (for ORR) with decoupled NiFe-LDH (for OER) in a rechargeable ZAB, Cu/Fe-NC&NiFe-LDH based ZAB delivers a small and stable voltage gap between charging and discharging with slight change from 0.59 V to 0.60 V in continuous 300 cycles (102 h), indicating the higher energy conversion efficiency and stability than those for Pt/C (from 0.63 V to 0.69 V in Figure 6e and Figure 6f). It is well known that ZAB with neutral electrolyte could avoid the corrosion and carbonation by alkaline electrolyte. As expected in neutral condition, the Cu/Fe-NC assembled ZAB fully surpasses Pt/C assembled one in a series of tests, including open circuit voltage, multi-current cycles, discharge polarization, power density and specific capacity (Figure S24), completely confirming the excellent pH-universal activity, stability and feasibility of Cu/Fe-NC.

Overall, the dual-metal doped Cu/Fe—NC shows wonderful prospect to be a candidate of ORR catalyst to replace commercial Pt/C in alkaline, acidic and neutral conditions. The high performance of Cu/Fe—NC is ascribed to the following reasons: Firstly, the high degree of defects and high fractions of micropores and mesopores facilitate to provide more accessible active sites for ORR; secondly, the structure of copper nanoparticles fully encapsulated by carbon shell and M-N<sub>x</sub> functionalized graphitic matrix could inhibit nanocomposite from dissolution and result in ultralow H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> yield, greatly promoting Cu/Fe—NC stability and tolerance for various corrosive electrolytes; thirdly, the co-doping of Cu and Fe moieties into carbon matrix contributes to high conductivity, which provides an

electronic express way; finally, inspired by XPS characterization and electrochemical test results, an optimal electron transfer pathway (Cu—Fe) coupling with Fe and Cu moieties creates a synergistic effect to promote ORR process (Figure S25). Therefore, we have successfully constructed an excellent ORR electrocatalyst featured with wide pH availability.

#### Conclusion

In conclusion, we have synthesized a Cu Fe bi-metal and N codoped porous carbon material (Cu/Fe-NC) by simply coating on Cu foil and pyrolyzing Fe-ZIF8. The Cu/Fe-NC exhibits excellent ORR activity with half-wave potentials of 0.923 V, 0.757 V and 0.801 V, electron transfer numbers of 3.98, 3.99 and 3.95 as well as long-time stability (retention of  $J/J_0 > 90\%$ ) in alkaline, neutral and acid conditions, respectively. Especially, the excellent ORR performance of Cu/Fe-NC could be attributed to the integrative effect of wettable interface, conductive graphite structure, huge surface area (1503 m<sup>2</sup>/g), enriched micro-meso pores distribution and synergistic effect among different active sites. The investigation of zinc-air batteries equipped with Cu/ Fe-NC cathodes in both alkaline and neutral solutions demonstrate the superior discharge voltage, power density and stability. The present work opens a new avenue for developing a facile, economic, template-free and pH-universal ORR electrocatalysts.

# **Experimental Section**

Synthesis of Cu/Fe-NC catalyst. In a typical synthesis, 100 mL of solution containing 40 mmol 2-Melm and 9.5 mmol melamine was quickly poured into another 100 mL solution in which 5 mmol Zn(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>·6H<sub>2</sub>O and 0.5 mmol EDTA-Fe were dissolved. After mixing the two solutions by magnetic stirring for 24 h at room temperature, the pink Fe-ZIF8 precipitation was collected by filtration and drying. In pyrolysis procedure of Cu/Fe-NC, moderate amount of Fe-ZIF8 powder (nearly 24 mg/cm<sup>2</sup>) was applied to coat the prepolished Cu foil, which was then located in a tube furnace and heated at a speed of 5 °C/min and carbonized at 1000 °C for two hours in argon atmosphere. The carbonization yield of Cu/Fe-NC approximately 20~30%. Similarly, Fe-N-C, Cu-N-C and N-C samples were synthesized with same process, except that Cu foil, EDTA-Fe and both of them were absent, respectively. For comparison, a series of Cu/Fe-NC were also synthesized at different temperatures including 800 °C, 900 °C and 1100 °C.

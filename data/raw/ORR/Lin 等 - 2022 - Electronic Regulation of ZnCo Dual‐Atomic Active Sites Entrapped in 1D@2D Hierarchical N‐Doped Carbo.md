## **1. Introduction**

Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is a paramount participant in clean energy storage and conversion devices, such as, proton-exchange-membrane fuel cells and metal–air batteries.[1] Although, Ptbased ORR catalysts substantially improve the kinetics of ORR, the high price and instability of Pt prevent their large-scaled development.[2]

In the recent years, transition metal (mostly Fe, Co, and Ni) based catalysts are considered as prospective candidates to substitute Pt-based ones, attributing to their high electrocatalytic activity and abundance of resources.[3] An entrapment of metal(s) and nitrogen in carbon (M-N*x*-C) is a common strategy, which exhibits the high cyclic stability and accelerates ORR kinetics by finely modulating the electronic structures.[4]

Further, the construction of dual-atomic sites in doped carbon is conducive to modify the electronic structures of main

active metal atoms, which consequently reduces the binding energies of the ORR intermediates.[5] For example, the FeM-N*x* (M = Co, Ni, Mn) exhibited an accelerated ORR activity, in which Fe was the main active site with a lower energy barrier, while the co-doped M finely regulated the electronic structure of the Fe center.[6] However, the partially dissolved Fe ions, accompanied by the incomplete reduced/oxidized H2O2, are inclined to catalyze the Fenton reaction to generate oxidative hydroxyl radicals which would deteriorate the electrode and the operation stability.[7] Therefore, it is imperative to further develop Fefree catalysts in oxygen-related reactions.

Owing to the fully-filled orbits (3d104s2), Zn element is inactive in Fenton reaction.[8] Furthermore, in contrast to variable valency metals, the full *d* orbital structure of Zn also exposes its inferior catalytic property.[8b] Fortunately, the outer electrons of Zn are more liable to transfer to Fe/Co due to their much lower electronegativity (χ = 1.65) compared to Fe (χ = 1.83) and Co (χ = 1.88), making Zn an ideal charge adjuster in dual metal systems.[9] Additionally, a Zn-N*x* coordinated structure is readily

available in nature as those of Fe and Co.[10] As a result, the M-Zn system has been successfully explored as a catalyst for oxygen-related reactions.[11]

Apart from the synergistic effects between multicompositions, catalyst morphology shows close relation to the catalytic properties.[12] For example, 1D nanotubes have large specific surface area and good chemical stability, while the 2D materials possess abundant active sites accessible to reactants facilitating mass and charge transfer.[13] In 1D@2D structure, the integrated hierarchical structure has both the improved operational stability and superior interfacial conductivity, and acts as a fascinating catalyst unlike monomorphic materials.[14] However, the formation procedure for such 1D@2D structures is always tedious and complicated, commonly involving several steps to achieve the targeted morphology.[15]

In this study, we developed a simple strategy of ZnCo dualatomic sites, doped in hierarchical N-doped carbon (HNC) with 1D nanotubes wrapped in 2D nanosheets structure (1D@2D ZnCo-HNC), by pyrolyzing the mixture of zinc acetate, cobalt chloride, and 6-aminouracil (6-AU). Due to the unique structure and effective ZnCo-N*x* sites, the ZnCo-HNC was critically examined as a catalyst for the ORR and home-assembled Zn– air battery. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations were conducted for the ZnCo-N*x* system in detail to illustrate the corresponding catalytic mechanism in this research.

# **2. Results and Discussion**

# **2.1. Characterizations**

**Figure 1** illustrates the synthesis of ZnCo-HNC. Initially, a mixture of zinc acetate (Zn(CH3COO)2), cobalt chloride (CoCl2) and 6-aminouracil (6-AU) was blended together and fully ground to form the homogenous pink mixture (Figure S1, Supporting Information), where the metal salts were simultaneously chelated with 6-AU. After the follow-up pyrolysis at 800 °C and sequential acid etching, the black powder was ultimately obtained and carefully examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, **Figure 2**A). It clearly shows plenty of 1D nanotubes wrapped in 2D nanosheets (termed as 1D@2D for simplification). Such structure would adequately combine the intrinsic properties given by 1D nanotubes (excellent chemical stability) and 2D nanosheets (highly exposed active sites), thereby broadening their potential applications.

To explore the synthetic mechanism of the ZnCo-HNC, pyrolytic samples were prepared by changing the initial feeding ratio of the metal salts, which showed distinct but correlated morphologies.[16] Only 6-AU is found to yield the sample with wrinkled dendritic structures (Figure S2A, Supporting Information), denoted as NC-800. After introduction of the Co precursor to the 6-AU, the resulting sample (Co-800) exhibits more uniformly interconnected flake-like structures with abundant holes under the identical conditions (Figure 2B). The evident difference in the shape of the Co-800 from that of the NC-800 clearly implies the regulation effect of the product morphology by the loading metal.

It is observed that the incorporation of Zn in the Co-doped carbon matrix significantly changes the product morphologies, due to the synergistic interactions between Zn and Co (Figure 2 and Figure S2, Supporting Information). To be specific, when the ratio of Zn to Co is 1:3 (i.e., Zn/Co = 1:3, named as ZnCo3- 800), a large number of shinning nanosheets interlace together, forming a flower-like structure with rich holes (Figure 2C and Figure S3A, Supporting Information). These flower-like structures are found to gradually collapse as the Zn content increases (Zn/Co = 1:2, ZnCo2-800, Figure 2D). At the equal Zn/Co ratio, sufficient Zn successfully promotes partial nanosheets to curl into ultrathin nanotubes,[17] harvesting the unique 1D@2D structure of ZnCo-HNC (Figure 2A). Likewise, the higher Zn/ Co ratio (Zn/Co = 2:1, Zn2Co-800) results in the complete transformation of the remnant nanosheets to 1D nanotubes, and only

thickened nanotubes are observed for the Zn2Co-800 (Figure 2E and Figure S3B, Supporting Information). The evaporation of excess Zn, when the Zn/Co ratio increases to 3:1, causes a slow destruction of nanotubes along with the haphazard emergence of huge holes (Zn3Co-800, Figure 2F).[18] An irregular dendritic structure appeared when only Zn is involved in the Zn-800, as predicted in Figure S2B, Supporting Information, owing to the further rupture of the above structures under the strong flow during Zn volatilization.[19] The sequential phenomena visually reveal the importance of the synergetic effect between Zn and Co, and demonstrate that the 1D@2D structure of ZnCo-HNC is obtained only at an equal Zn/Co ratio (Figure 2A), and offers an effective guidance for synthesis of advanced 1D@2D materials.

The structure of ZnCo-HNC was investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As depicted in **Figure 3**A, multiple nanotubes wrapped in the nanosheets clearly confirm the generation of the 1D@2D structure, in line with the SEM analysis. Moreover, the high-resolution TEM (Figure 3B) displays a single nanotube overlapped by partial nanosheet.

Further, legible lattice fringes are observed with the inter-planar spacing of 0.32 nm, which match well with the (002) planes of graphitic carbon, underlining the presence of graphitic carbon nanotubes.[20]

Figure 3C shows the aberration-corrected atomic-resolution high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron image. Multiple small bright well-dispersed dots (regarded as Zn and Co) are observed on the carbon substrate. Furthermore, the ZnCo diatomic pairs distinctly show up in the magnified image (Figure 3D), as marked with orange circles. By randomly selecting 50 diatomic pairs, the statistical distance is calculated to be 0.22 nm between two bright spots (Figure 3E), affirming the existence of the ZnCo dual-atomic sites, in good agreement with the early research.[9,21] Moreover, energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) mapping images show the even distributions of C, N, Co, and Zn elements (Figure 3F), further showing the coexistence of 1D nanotubes and 2D nanosheets.

The ZnCo-HNC barely shows any diffraction peak of metallic Co in the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern as compared to Co-800 (**Figure 4**A). Combining the XRD patterns of ZnCo3- 800 and Zn2Co-800 (Figure S4, Supporting Information), the competition coordination effect is identified between Zn and Co, which atomically disperses.[9]

The porous structure was further investigated using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller analysis.[22] As declared in the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms (Figure 4B), the ZnCo-HNC has the specific surface area of roughly 354.1 m2 g–1 with the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda average pore size of 5.4 nm (inset in Figure 4B), suggesting the mesopore character. Such unique structure would provide abundant active sites readily exposed to the targets and facilitate the mass and/or electron transfer promoting the catalytic efficiency.[23]

The defective and graphitic degrees were meticulously characterized by Raman spectroscopy (Figure 4C).[24] The characteristic peaks at ≈1352 and ≈1602 cm−<sup>1</sup> are related with *D*-band of sp3 defects and *G*-band of sp<sup>2</sup> graphite carbon,[25] respectively. The ZnCo-HNC possesses the smallest intensity ratio (*I*D/*I*G, 0.95) than the counterparts ZnCo-700 (0.99) and ZnCo-900 (0.97), implying the highly enhanced graphitization degree that is beneficial to the charge transfer. This scenario is different from the previous research, in which the graphitic degree tends to increase as the temperature increases.[26] The inevitable evaporation of Zn in ZnCo-900 creates a large number of defects to

**www.small-journal.com**

further enlarge the *I*D/*I*G, [27] finally resulting in the enhanced graphitization of ZnCo-HNC, pyrolyzed at the standard temperature. Additionally, Figure S5, Supporting Information, displays the *I*D/*I*G of ZnCo-HNC, lying between Zn-800 (1.06) and Co-800 (0.93), which further confirms the significant influence of zinc evaporation on the enlargement in the defects. It proves the essential role of the synergetic effect between Zn and Co in generating such graphitic nanotubes.

To scrutinize the surface chemical compositions and elemental valence states in detail, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were recorded.[28] Figure S6A, Supporting Information, depicts existence of Zn, Co, O, N, and C in the survey XPS spectrum of ZnCo-HNC, with the atomic contents of 0.36%, 0.53%, 8.52%, 5.93%, and 84.66%, respectively. The metal contents are nearly in good line with the EDS results (Figure S7, Supporting Information). The Zn 2p XPS spectrum (Figure 4D) can be deconvoluted into two peaks at 1022.2 and 1045.5 eV, attributing to the spin-orbit of Zn 2p3/2 and Zn 2p1/2, [29] respectively. Moreover, the peak intensities of the ZnCo-700, ZnCo-HNC, and ZnCo-900 show an observable downtrend by increasing the pyrolytic temperature, further confirming continuous Zn evaporation.

Figure S6B, Supporting Information, shows the Co 2p spectrum of ZnCo-HNC. The distinct peaks at 780.5 and 795.9 eV combined with satellite peaks at 785.5 and 803.0 eV are attributed to Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2 of high valence,[30] respectively, which are also the proof of Co-N*x* species.

As illustrated in Figure 4E, the N 1s segments of the ZnCo-HNC can be well divided into five peaks, which correspond to the pyridinic N (398.5 eV), M-N*x* (399.7 eV, M = Zn and/or Co), pyrrolic N (400.5 eV), graphitic N (401.6 eV), and oxidized N (404.2 eV).[9] Similar observations show up in the cases of ZnCo-700 and ZnCo-900 in the controls. As we can notice, the ZnCo-HNC has the highest content of M-N*x* (21.77%) as compared to the ZnCo-700 (19.79%) and ZnCo-900 (12.47%), owing to the sharp decrease in the residual Zn content due to its evaporation, as the pyrolysis temperature elevates. The M-N*x* moieties are the pivotal active sites in atomically dispersed M-N*x*-C catalysts,[31] which can efficiently catalyze the ORR as a promising candidate.

The contents of graphitic and defect carbon in the samples were also evaluated according to the C 1s sections (Figure 4F), in which the two main peaks at 284.5 and 285.1 eV correspond to the sp2- and sp3 -hybridized carbon,[32] respectively. As calculated, ZnCo-HNC displays the highest sp2 /sp3 ratio of 1.16 as compared to the referenced ZnCo-700 (0.98) and ZnCo-900 (0.98), demonstrating the predominant sp2 graphitic carbon in the ZnCo-HNC, in good accordance with the Raman analysis.[33] Apart from the above, the peak at 286.4 eV is assigned to CN, which observably proves the doping of N in the carbon matrix, while the one at 288.6 eV correlates to the CO bonds.[34] Such high content of graphite is the key to high electrical conductivity, indicating the desired ORR property of the ZnCo-HNC.[35]

#### **2.2. Electrocatalytic Activity**

With the advantages of the large active surface area, high electrical conductivity, and abundant M-N*x* sites, the ZnCo-HNC was carefully explored as a catalyst for ORR, by using the other investigated catalysts as the references. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were primarily recorded to investigate the ORR catalytic activity in O2- and N2- saturated 0.1 m KOH solution (Figure S8, Supporting Information). Significant reduction peaks are observed for the bimetallic catalysts in the O2-saturated circumstance, suggesting their superior ORR performance.[36] However, no obvious peaks are detected for the monometallic counterparts, revealing the effective synergetic effects between Zn and Co.

Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) measurements (**Figure 5**A) were performed to evaluate the ORR catalytic activities. Interestingly, the ZnCo-HNC (1.05 V) exhibits the similar onset potential (*E*onset) to the ZnCo-700 (1.05 V) and ZnCo-900 (1.04 V), surpassing commercial Pt/C (0.96 V). Moreover, the ZnCo-HNC shows the highest limiting current density (*j*L) of 6.10 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> (Figure 5A) among the catalysts, albeit with their almost identical morphologies (Figure S9, Supporting Information), which is attributed to the excellent conductivity originated from the highest graphitization degree and the most M-N*x* moieties in the standard synthesis. The ZnCo-HNC shows the half-wave potential (*E*1/2) of 0.82 V, same with Pt/C (0.82 V) and comparable to most of the reported M-N*x* catalysts (see details in Table S1, Supporting Information). Additionally, the ZnCo-HNC demonstrates the best ORR catalytic activity by comparing the *E*1/2 and *j*L values from the LSV analysis of the catalysts obtained at different Zn/Co feeding ratios (Figure S10, Supporting Information). These results confirm the necessity for the development of the unique 1D@2D structure.

The superior ORR activity of the ZnCo-HNC is further proved by Tafel slope derived from the LSV curves, which is the lowest (62.3 mV dec−<sup>1</sup> , Figure 5B) in comparison with the other references, even much better than that of Pt/C (92.9 mV dec−<sup>1</sup> ), implying the highly accelerated kinetics during the ORR process.[6] All of the above analysis reinforces the superior ORR activity of the ZnCo-HNC, owing to their rich ZnCo-N*x* active sites, high graphitic degree, and remarkable 1D@2D structure.

To explain the ORR kinetics of the ZnCo-HNC in depth, LSV curves were acquired at different rotational rates ranging from 400 to 2025 rpm (Figure 5C), where the *j*L increases with the increase in the rotational rates and fits well to the first-orderdynamic equation.[11a] The average electron transfer number (*n*) is around 4.06 from the Koutecky-Levich (K-L) plots (inset in Figure 5C), reflecting the direct reduction of O2 to H2O with high efficiency on the ZnCo-HNC.[21] This assumption is further confirmed by the rotating ring-disk electrode measurements (Figure 5D), where the H2O2 yield is always below 6.5% with the average *n* of 3.87.

Moreover, the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) has significant impact on the ORR, which can be evaluated by double-layer capacitances (*C*dl, Figure 5E) in the CV curves (Figure S11, Supporting Information).[37] Specifically, the ZnCo-HNC exhibits a higher value of *C*dl of 46.97 mF cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> than ZnCo-700 (27.27 mF cm<sup>−</sup>2) and ZnCo-900 (20.17 mF cm−2), implying the sharp increase in the active sites for the ZnCo-HNC.[38] As speculated, the ZnCo-HNC exhibits the significantly enlarged ECSA over these bimetallic counterparts fabricated at the lower or higher temperature, mainly on account of the highest graphitization degree and highest content of

M-N*x* achieved at the standard temperature. Notably, the *C*dl values of the bimetallic catalysts are much higher than that of Co-800 (6.58 mF cm<sup>−</sup>2), which also highlight the unique 1D@2D structure and synergetic effect within the ZnCo-N*x* to create more active sites.

However, the Zn-800 exhibits the inferior ORR activity albeit with the highest *C*dl of 108.18 mF cm<sup>−</sup>2, owing to the significant decay in the active Zn-N*x* caused by the zinc evaporation regardless of its strong ability to create more defects.[39]

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was adopted to explain such phenomena based on the interfacial charge transfer of the catalysts, which can be calculated from the Nyquist plots (Figure 5F).[40] The ZnCo-HNC has the least charge-transfer resistance (*R*ct) among the catalysts, resulting in the fastest ORR kinetics, in good agreement with the above analysis. Moreover, all of the bimetallic catalysts demonstrate smaller *R*ct than their monometallic counterparts, due to the unique 1D@2D structure and striking synergetic effect of Zn with Co, accelerating the charge transfer during the ORR procedure. In addition, the Zn-800 characterizes considerably higher *R*ct, due to the substantial defects provided by the carbon substrate that adversely deteriorate the charge transport.[27]

Long-term stability is also one of the crucial parameters to estimate the possibility for practical applications of advanced catalysts.[41] As depicted in Figure 5G, the ZnCo-HNC presents negligible shift of the *E*1/2 (18 mV) in the negative direction after continuous scan for 2000 cycles, which is smaller than Pt/C (20 mV, Figure S12, Supporting Information), indicating the excellent cyclic stability of the ZnCo-HNC. Furthermore, the durability was also evaluated by the chronoamperometry test (Figure 5H). The *j*L of the ZnCo-HNC remained 94.4% of its original value after the 10 h testing, more than that of Pt/C (69.2%) in the identical circumstance, which confirms the enhanced durability of the ZnCo-HNC. The significantly enhanced stability is mainly attributed to the extraordinary

1D@2D structure and the multi-compositions, which mutually support each other.[15a]

Finally, methanol tolerance of a catalyst is also important in methanol fuel cells, because the ORR is an indispensable half reaction.[42] Evidently, there is no obvious deviation of the CV curves before and after injecting 1.0 m methanol into the alkaline solution (Figure S13, Supporting Information), coupled by the negligible change noticed in the chronoamperometric curve after such injection (Figure 5I). These phenomena reflect that the ZnCo-HNC is nearly free from the methanol crossover effect. Combining its appealing ORR catalytic properties and strong methanol tolerance, the ZnCo-HNC is supposed to play an important role in metal–air batteries and methanol fuel cells.

#### **2.3. Density Functional Theory Simulation**

To obtain a thorough insight into the intrinsic catalytic mechanism of the ZnCo-HNC, DFT calculations were performed for the Zn-N*x*, Co-N*x*, and ZnCo-N*x* models (**Figure 6**A–C). The ZnCo-N*x* system shows the most obvious electron redistribution over the others, indicating the significantly strengthened interactions upon the coupling between Zn and Co.[43]

For the above models, the Gibbs free energies for each reaction step (see details in Supporting Information) were critically calculated (Figure 6D–F). With regard to the Zn-N*x*, the last reduction step (the hydration of \*OH reaction) is the rate-determining step with an energy cost of 0.79 eV, which is higher than that of the Co-N*x* system (0.71 eV) for the same step. After subtly combining them together, the Co center in the ZnCo-N*x* (labeled as Co/ZnCo-N*x*) displays the smallest energy cost of 0.50 eV in comparison with the monometallic systems, indicating the significantly promoted ORR performance.[44] On the contrary, the energy cost sharply increases up to 0.93 eV for the Zn counterpart (denoted as Zn/ZnCo-N*x*, Figure S14, Supporting Information). These observations show Co as the real active center rather than Zn in the ZnCo-N*x* system. In other words, Zn works as an effective electron adjuster to Co in this context.

To further illustrate the dual-atomic influences on ORR activity, partial density of states and *d*-band center were adopted to analyze the associated electronic properties. Compared to the Zn-N*x*, the overall *d* orbitals of the Zn/ZnCo-N*x* shift slightly away from Fermi level. Besides, the *d*-orbitals of the Co/ZnCo-N*x* are distinctly split into several peaks in contrast to the Co-N*x*, in which two of the peaks move away from Fermi level form, while the other peaks shift toward Fermi level (Figure 6G,H). These variations in the *d*-states of the active center strongly indicate the electron redistribution and changed electron structures occurred at the Co/ZnCo-N*x* sites, which are paramount to ORR performance. Furthermore, Figure 6I shows the volcano curve between the overpotential and d-band center with the proportional correlation. The Co/ZnCo-N*x* occupies the moderate *d*-band center and lowest overpotential, and the Zn

acts as an effective electronic regulator. All of the results indicate a remarkably accelerated ORR catalyzed by the ZnCo-N*<sup>x</sup>* system and rationalize the high ORR activity in the aforementioned experiments.

#### **2.4. Application in Zn–Air Battery**

By virtue of excellent ORR performance, ZnCo-HNC is a promising candidate as an air cathode in a metal–air battery. To evaluate the application of ZnCo-HNC in practice, **Figure 7**E schematically illustrates the construction of a primary Zn–air battery by utilizing ZnCo-HNC as an air cathode and a 6.0 m KOH solution containing 0.2 m Zn(CH3COO)2 as an electrolyte.

The rate capability of the home-assembled Zn–air battery was carefully examined at different discharge densities (e.g., 2, 5, 10, and 20 mA cm−<sup>2</sup> , Figure 7A). It is worth noting that the potential platforms are steady even at the high current density of 20 mA cm−<sup>2</sup> , and the discharge voltages can recover its initial values with the backward current density, revealing the remarkable reversibility of this Zn–air battery.

Besides, the ZnCo-HNC-based Zn–air battery delivers a narrower charge–discharge voltage gap (1.180 V at 70 mA cm−<sup>2</sup> ) than its Pt/C + RuO2 based counterpart (1.393 V at 70 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> ), which indicates the significantly better recharge capability of the assembled battery. Moreover, the discharge polarization curves and derived peak power density plots were recorded to study the discharge ability of ZnCo-HNC (Figure 7B). Impressively, the ZnCo-HNC-based Zn–air battery, which is comparable with most of the early reported Zn-based Zn–air batteries (Table S2, Supporting Information), displays the maximum power density of 123.7 mW cm−<sup>2</sup> (Figure 7C), substantially above the referenced Pt/C + RuO2 counterpart (79.2 mW cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> ).

When the assembled Zn–air battery is operated at 5 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> for 110 h (Figure 7D), the final potential difference (0.848 V) is almost close to the initial one (0.879 V). As compared to this, an unacceptable change is noticed for the Pt/C + RuO2 based battery within 60 h. These scenarios prove the significantly enhanced long-term durability of rechargeable Zn–air battery assembled using ZnCo-HNC, and display the feasibility of its practical application in future.

Furthermore, two ZnCo-HNC-based Zn–air batteries were connected in series (Figure 7F). Notably, they are capable of powering a red light-emitting diode in parallel, thus manifesting the promising applicability of ZnCo-HNC in advanced Zn–air batteries.

# **3. Conclusion**

To summarize, a convenient bio-inspired one-step pyrolysis method was developed for the construction of ZnCo-HNC, whose 1D@2D structure was mainly determined by the optimal Zn/Co feeding ratio. The ZnCo-HNC exhibited remarkable catalytic activities with the *E*onset of 1.05 V and *E*1/2 of 0.82 V. Furthermore, the assembled Zn–air battery delivered the maximum power density of 123.7 mW cm−<sup>2</sup> and was operated steadily for 110 h (330 cycles), demonstrating the possibility of use of ZnCo-HNC in potential applications. As proved by the experimental and theoretical results, the adjusted Co centered ZnCo-N*x* dualatomic sites significantly accelerated the ORR, with Zn as the effective electron regulator. This study provides a promising strategy for the scalable synthesis of the optimal structure with dual-atomic sites, and offers certain instructive insights into the effective electronic regulation of dual ZnM-N*x* systems for the high-efficiency ORR in energy conversion and storage devices.

### **4. Experimental Section**

*Synthesis of ZnCo-HNC*: Typically, 0.37 g of Zn(CH3COO)2 (2.0 mmol), 0.48 g of CoCl2⋅6H2O (2.0 mmol), and 2.54 of g 6-AU (20.0 mmol) were ground in an agate mortar, followed by adding 0.5 mL of water to dissolve them uniformly and thoroughly. The resultant mixture was transferred into a tubular furnace, heated to 500 °C at a ramp rate of 5 °C min<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> and kept for 2 h in flowing N2 atmosphere. Further, it was elevated to 800 °C for another 2 h with a rate of 2 °C min−<sup>1</sup> in order to increase the loading mass of Zn.[8a] After acid treatment (0.5 m H2SO4) for 12 h, the resultant product was dried at 60 °C overnight, denoted as ZnCo-HNC for clarity.

*Synthesis of ZnxCoy-T (T* = *End Temperature)*: Similarly, the samples with different molar ratios of the Zn to Co precursor (Zn/Co) were also prepared via the similar procedure, including Zn-800, Zn3Co-800, Zn2Co-800, ZnCo2-800, ZnCo3-800, and Co-800. Besides, the temperature-controlled counterparts were synthesized at the end temperatures of 700 and 900 °C, named as ZnCo-700 and ZnCo-900, respectively.

The chemicals, characterizations, electrochemical measurements, computational method, and Zn–air battery test were summarized in the Supporting Information.

#### **Abstract**

Fe-N-C catalysts show great potential to replace Pt/C in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Polyaniline (PANI) is an ideal precursor with an abundant and homogeneous distribution of nitrogen sources. However, Fe-N-C based on PANI suffers from an unsatisfied performance in acidic media. Herein, a facile zinc-assisted synthesis of Fe-N-C based on PANI was reported in this paper. ZnCl2 templates can be removed completely in the pyrolysis procedure, creating abundant porous structures to accelerate the mass transfer and boost ORR performance. Fe-N-C-2 with the adequate and optimizing amount of zinc shows an excellent ORR performance (*E*1/2 = 0.91 V in alkaline and *E*1/2 = 0.825 V in acidic media) compared with Pt/C (*E*1/2 = 0.89 V in alkaline and *E*1/2 = 0.84 V in acidic media). Furthermore, a high power density and a long-term operation within 6 h of direct methanol fuel cell based on brilliant Fe-N-C-2 verify a great promising application of potable power devices in the future.

## **1 INTRODUCTION**

With the rapid development of portable devices including smartphones and computers, portable power devices are increasingly demanded. Direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs) show great potential in the global market due to their high energy densities, low working conditions, environmental friendliness, and simple structures as portable power devices [\[1–3\]](#page-7-0). However, a large amount of Pt-based catalysts are required because of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) with sluggish kinetics, which increases the cost and limits a wide commercial application [\[4, 5\]](#page-7-0). Furthermore, suffering from the poor methanol tolerance of Pt, the concentration of supplied methanol is limited by severe methanol crossover, leading to a low energy density of fuel cells, which is one of the biggest obstacles for long-term operated portable power devices [\[6\]](#page-7-0).

To solve these problems, great efforts have been focused on the synthesis of non-precious metal catalysts (NPMCs) with excellent performance [\[7–10\]](#page-7-0). Among all the efficient NPMCs, Fe-N-C catalysts attract great attention thanks to their great methanol tolerance, low cost, and abundant precursors [\[11–13\]](#page-7-0). Polyaniline (PANI) with an abundant and homogeneous distribution of nitrogen is an

outstanding precursor with great potential, which attracts great attention from scientists [\[14\]](#page-7-0). Wu Gang et al synthesized Fe-based catalysts derived from PANI, while the performance of PANI-Fe-C is still poorer compared with Pt/C [\[15\]](#page-7-0). For PANI-based Fe-N-C with high performance, researchers make a great effort to promote more active sites. Zhen Sun added g-C3N4 into the PANI and cyanamide during the pyrolysis process for the promotion of active sites [\[16\]](#page-7-0). The half-wave potential (*E*1/2) of the synthesized catalyst is 50 mV more positive than that of Pt/C in alkaline media. However, the performance of PANI-based Fe-N-C is still unsatisfactory in acidic media [\[17, 18\]](#page-7-0). Wulandhari Sudarsono and co-workers synthesized a Fe-PANI catalyst derived from reduced graphene oxide, and the *E*1/2 is still 50 mV negative than that of Pt/C [\[19\]](#page-7-0). Unsatisfied ORR performance in acidic media limits the application of PANI-based Fe-N-C catalysts in DMFCs, and the synthesis procedure deserves further optimization.

Porous structures play an important role in ORR [\[20\]](#page-7-0). Abundant microporous structures can explore a large amount of active Fe-Nx sites [\[21\]](#page-7-0), and macro pores can provide sufficient mass transport channels in ORR [\[12\]](#page-7-0). Therefore, the optimizing synthesis can focus on tuning the porous structures of catalysts. To better adjust the pores, template methods are widely applied in the synthesis procedure, such as silica [\[22\]](#page-7-0), nano MgO [\[23, 24\]](#page-7-0), F127 [\[25, 26\]](#page-7-0), P123 [\[27\]](#page-7-0), and so on [\[28\]](#page-7-0). However, sophisticated operations for template removal limit a widely commercial production [\[29\]](#page-7-0). In this regard, it is desirable to explore a facile synthesis based on removable templates for porous and outstanding Fe-N-C.

Zinc-assisted synthesis is an efficient and facile approach for excellent Fe-N-C with abundant porous structures [\[29, 30\]](#page-7-0). Owing to the low-boiling point of ZnCl2, it is convenient to remove the salt template during pyrolysis, leaving behind a large number of pores and hosting adequate ORR active sites [\[24\]](#page-7-0). Subin Park et al proposed a facile zinc-assisted synthesis of Fe-N-C, and the performance of the catalyst after ZnCl2 activation is superior to Pt/C [\[31\]](#page-7-0). Wu synthesized a catalyst with well-balanced hierarchical porous structures based on combined templates including ZnCl2 and SiO2 [\[32\]](#page-7-0). Li synthesized Fe-N-C with high activities owing to the optimizing method to control the pore-making process based on composite ZnCl2/KCl templates [\[33\]](#page-7-0). Therefore, the zinc-assisted facile pyrolysis method is a promising and efficient synthesis of Fe-N-C with abundant porous structures and high catalytic activities.

Herein, we report a zinc-assisted facile synthesis of PANI-based Fe-N-C. ZnCl2 was mixed with Fe precursor in the synthesis procedure to create abundant porous structures, and the adequate amount of ZnCl2 was analyzed by the physical and electro-chemical measurement in detail. Benefiting from the addition of ZnCl2, the specific surface area and efficient Fe-Nx active sites increase obviously, which can accelerate the mass transfer and boost the performance. Electrochemical tests confirm Fe-N-C-2 is the most excellent catalyst among all the prepared catalysts, which shows a higher ORR performance in alkaline media (*E*1/2 = 0.91 V) and a comparable ORR performance in acidic media (*E*1/2 = 0.825 V) compared with Pt/C (*E*1/2 = 0.89 V in alkaline and *E*1/2 = 0.84 V in acidic media). The brilliant performance is attributed to the adequate and optimum addition of ZnCl2, leading to a large specific surface area, high defect degree, and high densities of Fe-Nx active sites. A DMFC with excellent Fe-N-C-2 showed a high power density and good stability when operated with 4 M methanol, revealing a practical value of zincassisted facile synthesis in long-term operated portable power devices.

# **2 EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE**

## **2.1 Synthesis of catalysts**

Fe-N-C was synthesized according to the previous literature [\[15\]](#page-7-0). 2 ml aniline and 3 ml monocyanamide were dissolved in 80 ml 1.5 M HCl, and carbon black (BP2000, 0.4 g) dispersed in 80 ml 1.5 M HCl with 3 g FeCl3 and the addition of ZnCl2, followed by the addition of 5 g (NH4)2S2O8 dissolved in 80 ml 1.5 M HCl as an oxidant. After 3-h polymerization, the first pyrolysis was conducted at 900◦C in N2 for 1 h, and then the product was preleached in H2SO4 at 90◦C for 5 hours to remove any ORR-nonreactive phases. After washing treatment, a second pyrolysis was conducted in N2 for 2.5 h and NH3 for 0.5 h continuously at 900◦C. The product was leached in H2SO4, and then the final pyrolysis was performed in N2 for 2 h to obtain the catalyst. The prepared catalyst was named Fe-N-C-X, where X means the molar ratio of Zn to Fe. Fe-N-C-0 means no addition of ZnCl2 in the procedure.

## **2.2 Characterization**

The morphologies, structures, and disordered degree of carbon-based structures of Fe-N-C-X were performed by scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurement, and Raman spectroscopy respectively. The porous structures and composition of Fe-N-C-X were analyzed by nitrogen adsorption/desorption measurement and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), respectively. More details are recorded in the supporting information.

## **2.3 Electrochemical measurements**

All experiments were performed in a standard threeelectrode cell. All potentials are given relative to the reversible hydrogen electrode. According to our previous study, the loading of Fe-N-C-X was 800 µg/cm2, and the loading of Pt was 80 µg/cm2 as a comparison [\[34\]](#page-7-0). For rotating disk electrode (RDE) and rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE) tests, cyclic voltammetry (CV) tests were performed first, and then linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and staircase voltammetry (SCV) tests were conducted for polarization curves in O2-saturated media. More details are recorded in the supporting information.

## **2.4 Single DMFC tests**

As reported in our previous literature, the catalyst ink, including Fe-N-C-X and Nafion coated onto the surface of the microporous layer to fabricate a cathode gas diffusion electrode (GDE) [\[35\]](#page-7-0). Cathode GDE, Nafion 117, and anode GDE were sandwiched. The loading of the cathode catalytic layer was 4 mg/cm2, and the active area of the prepared MEA was 1 cm2.

## **3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION**

The properties of catalysts including morphology, structures, and components are related to the catalytic performance in ORR. The morphology of prepared catalysts was first characterized by SEM measurement. Figure 1a shows a typical SEM image of PANI-derived nanostructures of Fe-N-C-2, which is similar to the morphology of Fe-N-C-0 in Figure S1, demonstrating that zinc-assisted synthesis cannot affect the basic framework of catalysts. XRD measurement was performed to characterize the structures of all the prepared Fe-N-C-X catalysts. Figure 1b shows two broad diffraction peaks at approximately 25◦ and 44◦ assigned to the (002) and (101) planes of carbon respectively [\[36\]](#page-7-0), and no peaks from metal nanoparticles were observed, indicating no agglomeration of iron atoms. Furthermore, Raman spectra were conducted to explore the effect of ZnCl2 on the defect degree of the carbon matrix. Figure 1c shows two obvious peaks at about 1340 and 1590 cm−<sup>1</sup> related to the D band and G band separately. The D band and G band consist of disordered sp3 carbon and graphitic sp<sup>2</sup> carbon separately [\[37,](#page-7-0) [38\]](#page-7-0). Remarkably, in comparison to Fe-N-C-0, the intensity ratios of D band to G band (*I*D/*I*G) values of other catalysts increase obviously, which is attributed to the removal of the ZnCl2 template during pyrolysis. Fe-N-C-2 shows the highest *I*D/*I*<sup>G</sup> value among all the prepared cat-

alysts, which can be attributed to an adequate addition of ZnCl2.

N2 adsorption/desorption measurement was performed to characterize the porous structures of prepared catalysts. Figure [2a](#page-3-0) shows typical IV isotherms with an obvious hysteretic loop, indicating the existence of mesoporous structures [\[39\]](#page-8-0). Compared with Fe-N-C-0, the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of other

<span id="page-3-0"></span>**FIGURE 2** N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms (a) and the corresponding pore size distributions (b) of prepared catalysts

catalysts increases obviously, indicating an efficient poreforming process of zinc-assisted synthesis. Notably, Fe-N-C-2 shows the largest BET surface area (1949.44 m2/g). The corresponding Barrett-Joyner-Halenda pore-size distribution analysis is shown in Figure 2b. Remarkably, Fe-N-C-2 possesses the largest amount of mesoporous structures, confirming an adequate addition of the ZnCl2 template. As widely reported in the literature, mesoporous structures are efficient to explore more active sites and accelerate the mass transfer in ORR [\[40\]](#page-8-0).

Besides the study on the morphology, defect degree, and porous structure, XPS measurement was then conducted to explore the chemical composition of prepared catalysts. Figure [3a–d](#page-4-0) reveals that the high-resolution N 1s spectra of Fe-N-C-X are deconvoluted into pyridinic-N, Fe-Nx, pyrrolic-N, graphitic-N, and oxidized-N [\[31–33\]](#page-7-0). Fe-Nx is widely reported to be efficient catalytic active sites in ORR [\[23, 41\]](#page-7-0). Figure [3e](#page-4-0) demonstrates that compared with Fe-N-C-0, the content of Fe-Nx in other catalysts increases apparently, which is attributed to the efficient zinc-assisted synthesis. Notably, Fe-N-C-2 possesses the highest content of Fe-Nx moieties among all the prepared catalysts. Furthermore, Figure S2 confirms that Fe-N-C-2 possesses the highest contents of Fe and N among all the prepared catalysts according to the XPS measurement.

Physical characters confirm that the zinc-assisted synthesis can promote more defect degree, more porous structures, and Fe-Nx active sites, which could be explained as follows. The removal of the ZnCl2 template during pyrolysis could not only create porous structures, leading to a higher surface area but also generated vacancy defects on the carbon matrix, corresponding with the Raman spectra. Furthermore, more defects are necessary for anchoring Fe atoms to create more Fe-Nx active sites [\[42\]](#page-8-0), and more porous structures can explore more active sites and boost ORR performance [\[43\]](#page-8-0), which corresponds with the XPS measurement. Interestingly, Fe-N-C-2 possesses the most defect degree, the highest surface area, and the most Fe-Nx active sites among all the prepared catalysts, confirming an optimum amount of ZnCl2 template in the synthesis procedure, which can be explained as follows. With the addition of ZnCl2 in the synthesis procedure, Zn atoms would be aggregated. After the volatilization of Zn-related agglomeration, porous structures would be generated. Therefore, with the amount of ZnCl2 increasing, more porous structures would be generated, leading to a higher surface area and more vacancy defects on the carbon matrix, which are a benefit to anchor more Fe atoms and create more active sites. However, with excessive addition of ZnCl2, the Zn-related agglomeration would lead to the collapse of the carbon matrix with the removal of ZnCl2. It indicates a smaller surface area, lower carbon defects, and Fe-Nx active sites, which corresponds with the N2 adsorption/desorption isotherm, Raman spectra, and XPS measurement.

After analyzing the physical characteristics of prepared catalysts, electrochemical measurements were conducted to investigate the catalytic performance. A typical RDE measurement was first conducted in alkaline media. Figure [4a](#page-4-0) demonstrates the most outstanding performance (*E*1/2 = 0.91 V) of Fe-N-C-2, even superior to Pt/C (*E*1/2 = 0.89 V). The excellent ORR performance ranks Fe-N-C-2 among the most brilliant NPMCs as recorded in Table S1. Because DMFCs are usually operated in acidic media due to the excellent stability of the proton exchange membrane, ORR performance in acidic media is more practical and meaningful. Hence, RDE measurement was then conducted in acidic media. The *E*1/2 of Fe-N-C-2 (0.825 V) calculated as shown in Figure [4b](#page-4-0) is only 15 mV negative than that of Pt/C (*E*1/2 = 0.84 V), ranking it among the most potential NPMCs as recorded in Table S2. As reported in the literature, Fe-Nx has been considered the most efficient ORR active site. Therefore, SCV tests were then conducted with the addition of 0.01 M KSCN in order to poison potential iron-based

active sites. As shown in Figure S3, an obvious decline in ORR performance confirms that efficient Fe-Nx active sites make a great contribution. Except for the highest density of Fe-Nx, the highest catalytic performance of Fe-N-C-2 among all the prepared catalysts also benefits from the largest BET surface area, most mesoporous structures, and most defect degree, which is attributed to the significant and efficient zinc-assisted synthesis and adequate addition of ZnCl2. Such excellent ORR performance seems practical for the application of DMFCs, so the electro-chemical mechanism deserves deeply researched.

To further study the electro-transfer process in ORR, SCV tests at different rotation rates were conducted. SCV curves are shown in Figure 5 and Figures S4a, S5a, and S6a, and then analyzed by the Koutecky-Levich (K-L) equation as shown in supporting information [\[44\]](#page-8-0). The electron transfer number of Fe-N-C-2 was calculated as 3.72, which is similar to the result in RRDE tests as recorded in Figure S7, indicating a high selectivity to 4 e<sup>−</sup> pathway for ORR. For a further study on the mechanism of ORR, Tafel slopes were extrapolated from the LSV curves shown in Figure 6a. Figure 6b exhibits that Fe-N-C-2 shows the lowest Tafel slope among all the prepared catalysts, which is a little higher compared with Pt/C.

Fe-N-C-2 with the most excellent performance in prepared catalysts shows great potential. Considering the application of Fe-N-C-2 in DMFCs, stability is a critical factor that deserves further investigation. The accelerated durability test was conducted by cycling between 0.6 and 1.0 V. Figure [7a,b](#page-6-0) shows that no apparent activity loss of Pt/C and Fe-N-C-2 was examined, indicating good stability. Besides, the chronoamperometric test of Fe-N-C-2 and Pt/C was also conducted at 0.5 V within 50000 s. Figure S8 confirms that Fe-N-C-2 shows comparable stability, which is suitable for long-term operated power devices. Furthermore, methanol tolerance is also significantly required. Therefore, RDE tests with the addition of 0.5 M CH3OH were conducted to evaluate the methanol tolerance. Figure [7c](#page-6-0) shows a large negative shift of over 270 mV of *E*1/2 occurs for Pt/C, indicating a poor methanol tolerance, which limits a high concentration of methanol, reduces the energy density, and restricts the commercial application. In contrast, as shown in Figure [7d,](#page-6-0) only a little negative shift of *E*1/2 occurs, indicating a great methanol tolerance of Fe-N-C-2. The good stability and

<span id="page-6-0"></span>**FIGURE 7** Staircase voltammetry (SCV) curves of Fe-N-C-2 (a) and Pt/C (b) in acidic media at 1600 rpm before and after 1000 cycles in durability tests; SCV curves with 0.5 M methanol solution in the O2-saturated 0.1 M HClO4 of Pt/C (c) and Fe-N-C-2 (d)

great methanol tolerance enable Fe-N-C-2 suitable for long-term operated DMFCs with a high concentration of methanol.

To demonstrate the application in long-term operated power devices, DMFCs with Fe-N-C-2 and Pt/C were manufactured and tested. The peak power densities of DMFC with Fe-N-C-2 and Pt/C reach 19.48 and 33.95 mW/cm2 separately as shown in Figure 8a and Figure S9a, which confirms that the performance of Fe-N-C-2 assembled cell is comparable in the literature [\[45–48\]](#page-8-0). The peak power density of the Fe-N-C-2 assembled cell exceeds 15 mW/cm2

even operated with 14 M methanol solution, indicating a high energy density, which corresponds with the great methanol tolerance. To demonstrate the potential of longterm operated devices, the stability test was conducted by a constant discharge current density of 50 mA/cm2. Compared with the performance of Pt/C assembled cell in Figure S9b, the stable performance of Fe-N-C-2 based DMFC in Figure 8b confirms that Fe-N-C-2 is quite suitable for a long-term operated DMFC. Therefore, Fe-N-C-2 shows great potential for a wide application of long-term operated portable power devices in the market.

## <span id="page-7-0"></span>**4 CONCLUSION**

In summary, we report a facile zinc-assisted synthesis of Fe-N-C catalyst based on PANI with excellent ORR performance in both alkaline and acidic media. ZnCl2 as the salt template can be removed completely during pyrolysis owing to the low melting point, which is efficient to create abundant porous structure and boost ORR performance. Fe-N-C-2 shows the most defect degree, highest BET surface area, largest mesoporous structure, and highest densities of Fe-Nx moieties, which is attributed to the efficient Zinc-assisted synthesis and adequate addition of ZnCl2. Furthermore, Fe-N-C-2 shows the most positive *E*1/2 and the lowest Tafel slope with high selectivity to 4 e<sup>−</sup> transfer pathway, and also exhibits good stability and great methanol tolerance. Notably, the *E*1/2 of Fe-N-C-2 (*E*1/2 = 0.91 V) is more positive in alkaline media and only a little negative in acidic media (*E*1/2 = 0.825 V) compared with Pt/C (*E*1/2 = 0.89 V in alkaline and *E*1/2 = 0.84 V in acidic media), ranking Fe-N-C-2 among the most excellent Fe-N-C catalysts. A single direct methanol fuel cell with Fe-N-C-2 outputs a maximum power density of 19.45 mW/cm<sup>2</sup> and a good stability performance in 6 hours. This work provides an efficient facile zinc-assisted synthesis for a brilliant PANI-based Fe-N-C, which is meaningful and practical for the application in long-term operated portable power devices.

Zinc–air batteries (ZABs) have received focused research due to their advantages such as high energy utilization and low pollution. However, the slow oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the high price of Pt/C catalysts severely limit the efficiency of ZABs. Therefore, the development of efficient, stable and inexpensive catalysts has become the key to the development of ZABs. In this study, we introduce Cu nanoclusters (NCs) to form coupled catalysts with FeNC catalyst, which can modulate and stabilize the geometry and electronic structure of the Fe active center during the reaction process. The Cu NCs also can promote the electron transfer of Fe atoms, thus significantly improving the electrocatalytic performance of the catalyst. The half-wave potential of the obtained CuNC @FeNC catalysts reaches 0.91 V and still possesses 82% activity after 60 000 s durability test, which is a significant improvement over commercial Pt/C under the same conditions. When assembled into ZABs, its power density reaches 259 mW cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> , which is significantly improved compared with the 199 mW cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> of the Pt/C catalyst.

Keywords: FeNC; Cu nanoclusters; coupled catalysts; oxygen reduction reaction; Zinc–air batteries.

#### 1. Introduction

Zinc–air batteries (ZABs) have been extensively researched in the field of clean energy due to their high energy density, low cost and environmental friendliness.[1](#page-8-1)[–4](#page-8-2) However, the slow kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) has become a bottleneck limiting the performance improvement of ZABs. Platinum (Pt)-based catalysts, which are commonly used as oxygen reduction catalysts, are limited by their high cost and poor stability, which further hinders the development of ZABs. Therefore, the development of efficient, low-cost nonprecious catalysts has emerged as an effective solution to this challenge.[5](#page-8-3)[–10](#page-8-4)

Transition metal single-atom catalysts (SACs) have demonstrated high utilization efficiency and abundant active sites, among which Fe-based catalysts show the most promising catalytic performance and potential to replace Pt-based catalysts.[1,](#page-8-1)[11](#page-8-5)[,12](#page-8-6) However, atomically dispersed FeNC catalysts, characterized by their highly symmetric Fe-N<sup>4</sup> structure, suffer from a uniform electron density distribution in the d-orbitals of Fe atoms, which is unfavourable for oxygen activation and limits catalytic activity.[13,](#page-8-7)[14](#page-8-8) In addition, FeNC catalysts experience degradation of the catalyst layer and deactivation of some Fe active sites during the ORR, resulting in an overall decrease in catalytic activity and severely limiting their practical application.[15](#page-8-9)[,16](#page-8-10)

Doping with nonmetallic atoms to modulate the coordination environment and constructing Febased diatomic catalysts have proven to be effective strategies for enhancing catalytic activity and stability. Recently, metal nanoclusters (NCs) modified Fe-N<sup>4</sup> SACs, such as Fe,,[17](#page-8-11)[–25](#page-9-0) Co[26–](#page-9-1)[28](#page-9-2) and Pd[28–](#page-9-2)[31](#page-9-3) NCs, have been reported to synergistically enhance the ORR activity and stability of Fe-N<sup>4</sup> single atoms (SAs). The coupled catalysts composed of NCs and SAs can effectively optimize the geometry and electronic structure of the active sites, promote electron transfer, reduce reaction barriers and improve catalyst kinetics, thereby enhancing the oxygen reduction capability. In addition, NCs can stabilize the active sites of FeNC catalysts by providing a protective layer, reducing oxidation and corrosion during the reaction, and preventing aggregation and deactivation under reaction conditions. Peng et al. found that metal clusters induce electron redistribution at isolated metal centers, optimizing the electronic configuration to facilitate desorption of ORR intermediates and accelerate reaction kinetics. The obtained Fe-ACSA@NC achieved a halfwave potential (E1/<sup>2</sup> ) of 0.90 V(@6.3 mA cm−<sup>2</sup> ) in alkaline media, which is superior to the commercial Pt/C catalysts.[32](#page-9-4) Wang et al. introduced Co clusters to modulate the electronic and geometric structure of Fe-N4, which significantly enhanced the acidic electrochemical activity of Fe-N<sup>4</sup> SAs sites.[9](#page-8-12)

In this study, Cu NCs and Fe SAs were introduced to form a coupling catalyst, and the electronic and geometric structures of Fe SAs were adjusted by Cu NCs, which affected the adsorption and activation of the catalyst to ORR reactants and intermediates, and promoted the electron transfer in the catalyst to enhance the catalytic performance. The obtained CuNC@FeNC material exhibited an E1/<sup>2</sup> of 0.91 V and maintained excellent stability after 60 000 s of durability test, significantly outperforming Pt/C catalysts. When assembled into ZABs, the power density of the CuNC@FeNC catalyst was 259 mW cm−<sup>2</sup> , showing a significant improvement over Pt/C catalysts. These results show that the introduction of Cu NCs into Fe SACs effectively improves the electronic structure of the active site, which significantly enhances their electrocatalytic performance.

The sandpaper-treated zinc sheet is used as the anode, and the ZABs are obtained by assembling the positive and negative electrodes and the electrolyte into a mold.

#### 3. Results and Discussion

The morphology of CuNC@FeNC electrocatalyst was observed by HRTEM and SEM [Figs. [1\(](#page-2-0)b) and [1\(](#page-2-0)c)], and maintains the orthododecahedral structure after calcination at 900◦C, suggesting that the morphology was not affected when Fe and Cu were added in a certain amount. HAADF-STEM was used to confirm that the Fe and Cu elements in the catalyst exist in the form of SAs or NCs [Fig. [1\(](#page-2-0)d)], which showed that there was no obvious lattice of metals in the catalyst. Many bright spots could be clearly observed, which were attributed to Fe SAs and Cu NCs, respectively. Meanwhile, it can be clearly seen that the various elements are uniformly dispersed in the carbon carriers [Fig. [1\(](#page-2-0)e)], which also indicates that no metal nanoparticles have been formed in the catalyst after the high-temperature pyrolysis process.

The XRD results showed that CuNC@FeNC, FeNC, NC exhibited similar characteristic peaks [Fig. [2\(](#page-4-0)a)], and no diffraction peaks of the corresponding metals were detected, which is in line with the results of HAADF-STEM. XPS studies were performed on FeNC, CuNC@FeNC and CuNC@FeNC catalyst after reaction to determine the chemical state and composition. In the survey spectrum [Figs. [2\(](#page-4-0)b) and [2\(](#page-4-0)g)], there were no significant peaks at the corresponding binding energies of Fe and Cu due to the low content. However, in the high-resolution spectra, the corresponding binding energy positions were found in the peak spectra of Fe 2p [Fig. [2\(](#page-4-0)c)] and Cu 2p [Fig. [2\(](#page-4-0)e)] peak spectra. For Fe 2p spectra, there is no significant difference between the peak intensities of the CuNC@FeNC and FeNC samples. In the high-resolution spectra of the CuNC@FeNC catalyst, compared to the FeNC, the Fe 2p3/<sup>2</sup> and the Fe 2p1/<sup>2</sup> of Fe3+, Fe 2p3/<sup>2</sup> and Fe 2p1/<sup>2</sup> of Fe3+ positive shift by 0.2 eV and 0.28 eV,[33,](#page-9-5)[34](#page-9-6) respectively, suggesting that the catalysts have the Fe single electrons in the atoms are transferred to the Cu NCs. Therefore, the introduction of Cu NCs will disrupt the symmetrical coordination structure of Fe-N<sup>4</sup> and induce the redistribution of charges, which can lead to a change in the adsorption strength of the active site for O2, \*OOH, \*O.[32](#page-9-4)[,35](#page-9-7) In addition, in the Cu 2p high-resolution spectra, four peaks were found at 932 eV, 935.2 eV, 951.8 eV, and 954.96 eV, which were attributed to the Cu 2p3/<sup>2</sup> and Cu 2p1/<sup>2</sup> of Cu+, Cu 2p3/<sup>2</sup> and Cu 2p1/<sup>2</sup> of Cu2+, <sup>2</sup>,<sup>35</sup> respectively. The result shows that the percentage of Cu<sup>+</sup> was 38% and that of Cu2+ was 34%, indicating that Cu was mainly present in the positive monovalent state in the catalyst. High-resolution N 1s spectra [Fig. [2\(](#page-4-0)f)] shows that N present in FeNC mainly in the form of pyridine N (40.2%), pyrrole N (30%), Fe-N/Cu-N (15.8%), graphite N (7.7%) and O-N (6%).[36–](#page-9-8)[38](#page-9-9) While in CuNC@FeNC were pyridine N (29.4%), pyrrole N (26.1%), Fe-N/Cu-N (22.2%), graphite N (10%) and O-N (11%), respectively. The result indicates that the ratio of Fe-N/Cu-N and pyrrole N increases with the increase of metal content and N coordinated to the catalyst, which will contribute to optimizing the performance of the catalyst. Moreover, due to the introduction of Cu, the graphite N content in the catalyst has an original 7.7% to 10%. According to previous studies, a large amount of graphitic N can promote the catalyst oxygen-containing intermediates with electron transfer, thus improving the electrochemical reaction kinetics.[14,](#page-8-8)[39](#page-9-10)[,40](#page-9-11) Furthermore, XPS analysis of the CuNC@FeNC catalyst before and after the reaction revealed that the percentage of various types of N in the N 1s spectrum remained almost unchanged [Fig. [2\(](#page-4-0)d)]. In the Cu 2p spectrum [Fig. [2\(](#page-4-0)e)], the percentage of Cu2+ increased from 34.3% to 36.4%, indicating the excellent stability of the catalyst Cu NCs. For the Fe 2p XPS spectra [Fig. [2\(](#page-4-0)d)], the

content of Fe2+ also decreased from 47% to 41%, indicating that Fe was oxidized in a small portion of the catalyst. Notably, there is a tendency for Fe 2p in the catalyst to shift toward higher binding energy after the reaction and Cu 2p to shift toward lower binding energy, indicating that electrons are transferred from Fe to Cu during the reaction process,[41](#page-9-12) suggesting that the introduction of Cu NCs improves the reaction kinetics and effectively optimizes the intrinsic activity of the catalysts. The valence and composition of the XPS of the catalyst before and after the reaction were analyzed, indicating that the catalyst still has high stability and more active sites after a long-term reaction.

Raman spectroscopy tests were performed on the materials to study the graphitization of carbon and the degree of defects in the catalysts [Fig. [2\(](#page-4-0)h)], and the results showed that the ID/I<sup>G</sup> value of NC formed by ZIF-8 calcination was 1.05, the ID/I<sup>G</sup> of FeNC was 1.06, and the ID/I<sup>G</sup> of CuNC@FeNC was 1.09. This suggests that the loading of Fe and Cu elements in the carbon substrate can significantly increase the degree of defects in the catalyst. According to previous studies, more defects make

the electrons in the catalyst easier to conduct and expose more active sites, thus effectively improving the catalytic activity of the catalyst.[14](#page-8-8)

The N<sup>2</sup> adsorption–desorption results showed that at lower pressures (P/P<sup>0</sup> = 0 − 0.015) [Fig. [2\(](#page-4-0)i)], the CuNC@FeNC catalysts showed significantly faster Vads growth compared to the other comparison samples, whereas at high N<sup>2</sup> pressures (P/P<sup>0</sup> = 0.4−0.95), there was a significant hysteresis loop for the CuNC@FeNC catalysts compared to the others, indicating that by the introduction of both Fe and Cu into the catalyst can effectively increase the percentage of mesopores and micropores in the catalyst pore size.[42](#page-9-13) It was also shown that the CuNC@FeNC catalyst has a higher specific surface area of 1375 m2/g compared to FeNC and CuNC catalysts, which is significantly better than FeNC (891 m2/g), and CuNC (1088 m2/g).

The electrocatalytic performance of CuNC@ FeNC was investigated using an RDE (@0.1 M KOH). The results show that the E1/<sup>2</sup> of the CuNC@FeNC catalyst is 0.91 V (@5.7 mA cm−<sup>2</sup> ) [Figs. [3\(](#page-5-0)a) and 3(b)], which is 58 mV higher than that of the Pt/C catalyst (0.852 V) and also significantly superior to NC (0.798 V), FeNC (0.834 V) and CuNC (0.837 V) under alkaline conditions. The ORR performance is comparable to or better than that of some non-noble metal catalysts reported recently (Table [1\)](#page-6-0). In addition, it was shown that the CuNC@FeNC catalyst had the

lowest Tafel slope [Fig. [3\(](#page-5-0)c)] of only 89 mV dec−<sup>1</sup> , with a significant improvement in the Tafel slope of the Pt/C catalyst (139 mV dec−<sup>1</sup> ), indicating the introduction of Cu NCs can effectively increase the kinetic process. It was also shown that the J<sup>k</sup> (@0.9 V) value of the CuNC@FeNC catalyst reached 6.92 mA cm−<sup>2</sup> while that of the commercial Pt/C was only 1.91 mA cm−<sup>2</sup> , which also demonstrates that the CuNC@FeNC catalyst has excellent ORR kinetic. In addition, durability tests (@0.86 V, 1600 rpm) were performed on CuNC@FeNC and commercial Pt/C [Fig. [3\(](#page-5-0)f)], and the CuNC@FeNC catalyst still possessed 82% activity after 60 000 s, whereas the Pt/C catalyst had only 54% after 15 000 s, which demonstrated that the introduction of Cu NCs can effective improving the stability of catalyst.

To further determine the H2O<sup>2</sup> yield and electron transfer number(n) of the catalyst under alkaline conditions, the results showed that the K-L plots [Fig. [3\(](#page-5-0)e)] under different rotational speed conditions exhibited a high linear correlation and the average n of the CuNC@FeNC was 3.97, which was consistent with a four-electron transfer path.

The n obtained by testing the catalyst using the rotating ring disk electrode [Fig. 3(d)] for the catalyst under the condition of 1600 rpm was 3.98, which also showed that the first-order kinetics of the catalyst was a four-electron transfer path. According to previous studies, the electron transfer path of the catalyst mainly includes two kinds, one is a four-electron transfer path and the other is a two-electron transfer path, and in the two-electron transfer path, the electrocatalyst produces abundant H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, which will lead to a mass of oxidation of the electrocatalyst, and thus the activity of the electrocatalyst will be attenuated. In this study, however, the  $H_2O_2$  yield of the catalyst is 4%, which is not significantly different from that of the Pt/C catalyst, indicating that the  $Cu_{NC}$  @FeNC catalyst has an excellent ORR kinetic reaction process.

The electrochemical double-layer capacitance of  $\mathrm{Cu}_{NC}$ @FeNC reached 11.8 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>, which was significantly better than that of the Pt/C catalyst (2.6 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>) and other reference samples [Figs. 4(a)–4(f)]. which indicated that the introduction of Cu NCs into the FeNC effectively improves the double-layer capacitance, and it was found that high double-layer capacitance could

effectively reduce the resistance of the electrocatalyst, thus optimizing the electron transfer efficiency and promoting the electrocatalyst kinetic engineering. Similarly, high double layer capacitance can effectively enhance the application of the catalyst in rechargeable ZABs, and enhance the energy storage effect and battery performance of ZABs.

The  $Cu_{NC}$  @FeNC catalyst was used as the cathode of a ZAB and tested for application in ZABs [Figs. 5(a)–5(d)], which showed that the open circuit voltage of battery reached 1.57 V, compared to only 1.45 V for the Pt/C electrocatalyst. In the power density test [Fig. 5(b)], the catalyst reached an ultimate power density of 259 mW cm<sup>-2</sup>, while the ultimate power density of the Pt/C electrocatalyst was  $198 \text{ mW cm}^{-2}$  only. For the battery specific capacity test, the specific capacity of the battery assembled with  $Cu_{NC}$  @FeNC catalyst [Fig. 5(c)] was 783 mA h  ${\rm g}_{Zn}^{-1}$ , which was better than that of the Pt/C catalyst (726 mA h  ${\rm g}_{Zn}^{-1}$ ). The Cu<sub>NC</sub>@FeNC catalyst showed excellent performance as one of the most important indicators of rechargeable ZABs. To further investigate the charge-discharge performance of the battery ( $@15.6 \,\mathrm{mA \, cm^{-2}}$ ) [Fig. 5(e)], the performance of the  $Cu_{NC}$ @FeNC catalyst did not show any significant degradation after 340 000 s. However, the activity of the ZABs assembled with the Pt/C electrocatalyst was inferior to that of the CuNC@FeNC electrocatalyst.

## 4. Conclusion

In summary, the introduction of Cu NCs can effectively change the electronic configuration of Fe-N4, reduce the reaction energy barrier, improve the mass transfer, and thus significantly enhance the catalytic activity. The result showed that the CuNC@FeNC exhibits excellent electrocatalytic performance in the ORR with an E1/<sup>2</sup> of 0.91 V and still has 82% activity after 60 000 s durability test (@0.86 V, 1600 rpm), which is inferior to that of the Pt/C. When assembling the ZABs, its peak power density reaches 259 mW cm−<sup>2</sup> , which is significantly improved compared with the 199 mW cm−<sup>2</sup> of the Pt/C electrocatalyst. Therefore, optimizing the electronic structure and geometry of FeNC electrocatalysts by introducing NCs thereby enhancing the ORR performance is a desirable and ideal way to be expected.

# A Facile Approach to Efficiently Load and Isolate CoN Active Sites for the Preparation of a High-Performance Co–N–C Oxygen Reduction Catalyst

Binghan Jiang, Xue Liu, Fuling Wang, Jianwei Ren, Tianle Yang, Zhicheng Jin, Xiyou Li,\* and Yanli Chen\*

A facile approach is developed for the preparation of an oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalyst Co–N–GA-1 by pyrolyzing a well-designed precursor CoTPP/ H2TPP@OGA. In the precursor, Co is preanchored into the porphyrinato cobalt CoTPP molecule by Co-N4 core that is further protected by the metal-free porphyrin H2TPP depending on the intermolecular π–π interaction during the selfassembled process on the surface of lipophilic porous original graphene aerogel. The resulted Co–N–GA-1 owns a Co elemental content up to 1.67%, which is 13 times than that of Co-N-CB-1 originated from a CoTPP/H2TPP precursor absorbed on commercial carbon black. Meanwhile, CoN content accounts for 71.7% of the total Co-based species in the Co–N–GA-1, more than that of CoN-GA-2 (58.9%) originated from the CoTPP@OGA precursor. Consequently, Co–N–GA-1 exhibits the most ORR performance among the present three catalysts with the more positive onset and half-wave potentials of 0.96 and 0.88 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode, respectively, also superior to those of the commercial 20 wt% Pt/C and most of the Co-based catalysts reported so far. Furthermore, Zn-air battery assembled with Co–N–GA-1 exhibits a higher peak power density of 110 mW cm<sup>2</sup> and excellent durability than that with Pt/C.

## 1. Introduction

Developing new energy storage and conversion devices is promising to solve the current impending energy and environmental crisis.[1–4] Among these devices, the fuel cell played an important role because of its high energy transfer efficiency, renewability, and environmental friendliness. Electrochemical oxygen reduction (ORR), occurring at the cathode of the fuel cell, determines the reaction speed of the entire device.[5] Today, Pt-based catalysts, thanks to their low overpotential, remain the most popular catalyst in commercial applications. But this does not cover up its shortcomings, such as high price and small reserves.[6–8] To overcome these deficiencies, research has shifted to nonprecious metal

catalysts, such as transition metal oxides, transition metal nitrides, and heteroatomdoped carbon materials, and so forth.

The conventional method of preparing metal-nitrogen-doped carbon electrocatalysts by loading active sites on carbon materials involve a simple physical mixing of nitrogen and transition metal salt and carbon precursors. But uneven distribution and severe agglomeration of active sites on the resulting carbon material during pyrolysis makes it difficult to possess efficient catalytic activity although the catalyst loads a high amount of metal-based species. For example, Li et al. obtained electrocatalysts by pyrolysis after irregular mixing of carbon materials and cobalt (II) acetylacetonate (Co(acac)2), resulting in the catalyst having a high metal loading content but a relative low half-wave potential of 0.77 V.[9] Some catalyst preparation process requires washing off the excess metal, which is a great waste of resources. To effectively

utilize the active sites for improving the electrocatalytic activity of Pt-free catalysts, it is of great interest to select suitable porous carbon precursors to load and disperse metal active sites.[10–14] For example, the ZIF-67 nanocrystals were grown in thermal-shock graphene networks, followed by etching to obtain novel carbon framework containing uniformly dispersed cobalt-based active sites with a half-wave potential of 0.808 V.[15] The porous aerogels possessing a large specific surface have received extensive attention in recent years. Shen et al. reported a single-atom Co-based catalysts from hierarchically porous biomass aerogel with a halfwave potential of 0.86 V. The porous structure of biomass carbon aerogel can evenly disperse the active sites, and the 3D structure of the aerogel also contributes to the transfer of electrons and ORR properties.[16] Obviously, the macroscopic three-dimensional structure of aerogels has good properties in terms of improved loading capacity and dispersed active sites. However, it is still a challenge to further improve the chemical and thermal stability and inherent electrical conductivity for such highly active ORR catalysts.

In contrast, rational design of the transition metal-nitrogencontaining precursors to render the M-N-C catalysts with stable and isolated active sites and well-controlled structures is also beneficial to obtain catalysts with excellent performance. Transition metal oxides and transition metal nitrides are usually used as active

sites. The catalytic activity and stability of transition metal oxidation are difficult to meet people's expectations. Compared with metal oxides, metal nitrides perform better, not only due to their characteristics of high conductivity and stability but also superior activity for ORR. [17,18] After Jasinski's first study of the ORR properties of cobalt phthalocyanine, a number of M-N<sub>x</sub>-containing macrocyclic compounds including metal phthalocyanines and metal porphyrins have been intensively studied as ORR catalysts. Especially, thanks for their unique structure and metal-nitrogen coordination, this family showed extraordinary catalytic activity upon pyrolysis. [19]

Combining these aspects, we herein reported a new strategy to prepare a catalyst named Co-N-GA-1 by pyrolyzing the CoTPP/H2TPP@OGA precursor where the CoTPP/H2TPP [CoTPP = 5,10,15,20-tetrakis (phenyl) porphyrinato cobalt (II),  $H_2TPP = 5,10,15,20$ -tetraphenylporphyrin] is deposited in situ on the OGA (original graphene aerogel) through a self-assembled process. The highly adsorptive and lipophilic characteristics ensure graphene aerogels as an effective carrier to load a mixture of CoTPP and H2TPP dissolved in chloroform, resulting CoTPP/H2TPP@OGA precursor, in which the Co central metal in CoTPP was further protected by  $\pi$ - $\pi$  interaction between CoTPP and H<sub>2</sub>TPP. The macroscopic three-dimensional pore structure of graphene aerogel can effectively disperse metal active sites and avoid the aggregation of metal active sites after pyrolysis. Notably, the graphene aerogel completely adsorbs CoTPP/H2TPP mixed solution and efficiently loads CoTPP, avoiding the waste of Co metal and reducing costs. The onset potential and half-wave potential of Co-N-GA-1 were 0.95 and 0.88 V, respectively. It has good stability and resistance to methanol poisoning. As a cathode material for Zn-air batteries, Co-N-GA-1 exhibited excellent durability and high power density of 110 mW cm<sup>-2</sup>, exceeding most reported catalysts.

#### 2. Results and Discussion

#### 2.1. Design and Synthesis

Because of the advantages of graphene aerogels and porphyrins, pyrolysis of graphene aerogels adsorbed with CoTPP and H2TPP is used to synthesize high-performance oxygen reduction electrocatalysts. Briefly, graphene oxide (GO) is reduced and freeze-dried to obtain OGA, as shown in Figure 1. The OGA adsorbs CoTPP and H<sub>2</sub>TPP dissolved in chloroform (CoTPP/H<sub>2</sub>TPP@OGA),

followed by pyrolysis under N2, named as Co-N-GA-1 (as shown in Scheme 1). For comparison, a similar protocol was also used to fabricate Co-N-GA-2. Co-N-CB-1, and GA from the respective precursor of CoTPP@OGA (only CoTPP alone adsorbed on OGA without H<sub>2</sub>TPP involved), CoTPP/H<sub>2</sub>TPP@CB (CoTPP/H<sub>2</sub>TPP absorbed on commercial Vulcan XC-72 carbon black), and OGA. The specific steps are shown in the Experimental section.

#### 2.2. Characterization

Graphene is a two-dimensional (2D) carbon nanomaterial formed by carbon atoms interconnected by sp<sup>2</sup> hybridization.<sup>[20,21]</sup> However, due to the  $\pi$ - $\pi$  interaction between the graphene sheets, the 2D graphene sheets will agglomerate, resulting in inadequate exposure of the active species on the surface of graphene. Obviously, the conversion of 2D graphene into 3D aerogel can overcome this defect to some extent. [22,23] As a macroscopic 3D bulk material, the graphene aerogel possesses a loose porous structure, high elasticity, and adsorption, which is one of the strongest adsorption materials to be reported so far. [24] Depending on the high concentration of GO aqueous solution, the graphene sheets can form a dynamic cross-linked network in water (named graphene hydrogel) upon the hydrothermal reduction reaction, Figure 1a. Meanwhile the part of the oxygen-containing functional groups on GO was removed, achieving the hydrophobic and lipophilic 3D OGA, Figure 1b.<sup>[25]</sup> As shown in **Figure 2**a–c, the contact angle of the OGA toward the water was 90.5°, which is a hydrophobic structure. The contact angle to chloroform is close to 0°, indicating that the as-prepared OGA is superlipophilic (Figure 2d-f). As for commercial carbon black, the contact angle of water is 33.4° (Figure 2g-i), which is much lower than that of OGA. This in turn suggested a higher hydrophobicity of OGA than CB. To further verify the lipophilic property of the OGA, a piece of OGA was placed into the chloroform solvent. We found that OGA can absorb 79 times its own weight of chloroform, which is much higher than CB that can only absorb 6 times its own weight of chloroform. Therefore, it is highly expected for the OGA to effectively absorb much more CoTPP/ H<sub>2</sub>TPP mixture dissolved in chloroform. It is worth noting that the hydrophobic properties of the OGAs should be unfavorable for the mass transportation of O2 in water. However, after pyrolyzing CoTPP/H2TPP@OGA precursor, graphene aerogel has been found to load with metal nitride and metal oxide (vide infra). The contact angle of the resulting Co-N-GA-1 is dropped to

49°(Figure S1, Supporting Information), implying the hydrophilic nature of Co–N–GA-1. Obviously, the species containing cobalt, nitrogen, and oxygen can enhance the hydrophilicity of the material surface, while the good wettability of the surface can help to enhance the electrocatalytic activity of the electrocatalyst in aqueous solution.[26–28]

In addition, the inductively coupled plasma (ICP) test results show that the cobalt content in Co–N–GA-1 and Co-N-CB-1 was 1.67 and 0.13 wt%, respectively. This unambiguously demonstrated the superior loading capacity of OGA to CB (Table S1, Supporting Information).

The SEM observation (Figure 3a,b) found that both Co–N–GA-1and Co–N–GA-2 all exhibited a unique layer structure with abundant wrinkles formed by cross-linking of lamellae texture, similar to that of GA (Figure 3c).[29] These suggested that the inherent graphene-like structures are preserved in both Co–N–GA-1 and Co–N–GA-2, which should have a positive impact on mass transfer efficiency for ORR. Furthermore, much more micro/mesopores appear on the surface of Co–N–GA-1and Co–N–GA-2, compared to those of GA. A large amount of released decomposing species from CoTPP and/or H2TPP molecules and instantaneous high internal pressure should be

responsible for the formation of porous in the resulting Co-N-GA-1 and Co-N-GA-2.[30] The porous structure on the GA sheet will increase the specific surface area and the degree of defects in the carbon matrix, thus improving the utilization of the active sites of Co-N-GA-1 and Co-N-GA-2, which in turn will facilitate the improvement of the catalytic performance.

Elemental mapping images of the Co-N-GA-1 and Co-N-GA-2 disclose the elemental distribution of Co, C, N, and O, as shown in Figure 4. In particular, the uniformly distributed Co element implied the Co-active sites in Co-N<sub>4</sub> units of CoTPP molecules on the GA without agglomeration after pyrolysis. For Co-N-CB-1, almost no Co distribution signal was observed on the carbon support, which also proves the poorer absorbing and loading capacity of CB to organic species compared to those of GA (Figure S2, Supporting Information). However, a small amount of elemental N was detected on the whole carbon matrix, which should be attributed to a little bit of the mixed CoTPP/H2TPP precursor absorbed into the CB matrix.

Furthermore, the transmission electron microscope (TEM) and high-resolution TEM measurements are used to further analyze the distribution and composition of the active sites of the asfabricated samples, as shown in Figure 5. For Co-N-GA-1, it can be seen that the nanoparticles are uniformly dispersed on the carbon substrate with an average diameter of around 40 nm (Figure 5a), while the average size of nanoparticles is up to  $\approx$ 90 nm formed on carbon substrate for Co–N–GA-2 (Figure 5b). This should be attributed to the incorporation of H<sub>2</sub>TPP into the CoTPP that effectively dispersed the resulting Co-based nanoparticles and inhibit their further aggregation during the pyrolysis process. The three-dimensional structure and rich internal pores of graphene aerogels can also facilitate the dispersion of active sites. [31] Due to too little cobalt loaded by Co-N-CB-1, only the carbon substrate material is visible on the TEM images (Figure 5c). HRTEM observation (Figure 5d) found three crystalline lattice fringes in Co-N-GA-1, which possess the d-spacings of 0.215, 0.246, and 0.339 nm, corresponding to the (200) plane of CoN, (111) plane of CoO, and (002) plane of graphitic carbon (GC), respectively. [32,33] Consequently, the CoN and CoO were successfully embedded into the graphitic carbon matrix. The formation of CoO originated from the residual O<sub>2</sub> reaction with Co during the pyrolysis process.<sup>[34,35]</sup> It is also true for Co-N-GA-2. CoO and CoN can also be seen in Figure 5e, with lattice spacing of 0.214 nm for the CoN (200) plane and 0.151 nm for the CoO (220) plane in addition to the (002) GC phase, respectively. As for Co-N-CB-1, due to too little cobalt loaded by Co-N-CB-1, only

the carbon substrate with (002) plane of graphitic carbon (GC) is visible on the TEM and HRTEM images (Figure 5f).

The structures of three samples are assessed using powder Xray diffraction (XRD). As shown in Figure 6a, all of the three samples show a main diffraction peak at 26.3°, corresponding to the (002) plane from the GC phase (PDF#41-1487), [31] this indicates the presence of amorphous carbon in the sample. In Co-N-GA-1, the diffraction peaks at around 36.19° and 42.19° were ascribed to the (111) and (200) planes of CoN (PDF#16-0166). The diffraction peaks at 36.50° and 42.40° correspond to the (111) and (200) planes of CoO (PDF#48-1719).[32-34] Similar diffraction peaks appeared in the XRD pattern of Co-N-GA-2 Figure 6a, with the lower peak intensity from CoN relative to those of the Co-N-GA-1. These are consistent with the results of HRTEM observations. Interestingly, the XRD pattern of Co-N-CB-1 (Figure 6a) is almost the same as that of the GA (Figure S3, Supporting Information), with only the (002) and (100) planes of GC detected without the peaks from CoN and CoO due to too small Co load on CB.

The porosity and specific surface area of Co-N-GA-1, Co-N-GA-2, Co-N-CB-1, and the GA are studied by nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms. All of them showed type IV isotherms (Figure 6b and S4, Supporting Information), suggesting the coexistence of micropores and mesoporous structures in the samples. [36] The specific surface area increased from GA (73 m $^2$  g $^{-1}$ ), Co-N-GA-2 (140 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>), Co-N-GA-1 (178 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>) in Figure 6b to Co-N-CB-1 (233 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>) in Figure S4, Supporting Information. The larger specific surface area achieved for the Co-N-GA-1 and Co-N-CB-1 originated from the mixed CoTPP/H2TPP precursor depending on the evaporation of a large amount of released decomposing species from the CoTPP/H2TPP macrocyclic molecules. [30] The large specific surface area can facilitate the rapid transport of reaction intermediates and provide more active sites for catalysis. [37] And the mesopore sizes of Co-N-GA-1 and Co-N-GA-2 have mostly distributed around 3.9 nm, which are among the range of a more suitable pore size of 3.5-5.5 nm for the ORR (inset of Figure 6b). [36] This indicated that the formation of the suitable mesopore sizes should result from the suitable precursors combined with porous carbon support.

The Raman spectrum reveals the extent of defects in the samples, as shown in Figure 6c. Porous carbon materials are generally rich in defective carbon structures. Two peaks can be seen in Figure 6c, 1336 cm<sup>-1</sup> corresponds to sp<sup>3</sup> defect sites (D band) and 1590 cm<sup>-1</sup> corresponds to sp<sup>2</sup>-bonded pairs (G band).<sup>[38]</sup> The  $I_D/I_G$  values of Co-N-GA-1 and Co-N-GA-2 are 1.15 and

1.14, respectively, which are higher than that of GA (1.05). This suggests that more graphitic edge and topological defects exist in Co–N–GA-1 and Co–N–GA-2 after adding CoTPP or CoTPP/ H2TPP into GA. Both porous and defected structures for Co–N–GA-1 and Co–N–GA-2 are helpful for adequate exposure of the active site and O2 exposure and good for charge/mass transport.

X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was further employed to determine the chemical state and bonding configuration of elements (Figure 7 and S5, Supporting Information). In Figure S5, Supporting Information, full XPS spectra of Co–N– GA-1 and Co–N–GA-2 reveal distinctive C, N, O, and Co peaks, illuminating the successful co-doping of Co and N in the as-prepared samples, respectively. Corresponding surface elemental contents of C, O, N, and Co are 89.74, 4.98, 4.71, and 0.56 at% for Co–N–GA-1, 88.2, 5.15, 5.67, and 0.48 at% for Co–N–GA-2, as summarized in Table S2, Supporting Information. A slightly higher Co content of 0.56 at% in Co–N–GA-1 than that (0.48 at%) in Co–N–GA-2 implied the effectiveness of the

preprotection strategy for Co active site by using CoTPP/ H2TPP precursor.

High-resolution XPS spectra of C 1s from both Co–N–GA-1 and Co–N–GA-2 are all fitted to CC (284.8 eV), CN (285.9 eV), and O–C=O (289.2 eV), showing the successful doping of N atoms in carbon skeleton of the two samples, as shown in Figure 7a,d. In the N 1s spectrum of Co–N–GA-1 (Figure 7b), four deconvoluted subpeaks are located at about 398.7, 401.1, 402.9, and 406.8 eV, which are attributed to the pyridinic-N/ Co-N (39.70 at%), pyrrolic-N (36.47 at%), graphitic-N (17.43 at%), and oxidized-N (6.40 at%).[39] It is also true for Co–N–GA-2 with four deconvoluted subpeaks appearing at 398.7 eV (pyridinic-N/Co-N, 32.29 at%), 401.1 eV (pyrrolic-N, 37.85 at%), 402.9 eV (graphitic-N, 12.32 at%), and 406.8 eV (oxidized-N, 17.54 at%), as shown in Figure 7e. Therefore, it was proved that Co and N elements were successfully loaded into carbon matrix of the two as-prepared samples. The appearance of Co-N bonding, combined with HRTEM and XRD, clearly confirmed the formation of CoN species in Co–N–GA-1 and Co–N–GA-2. Note

that the total content of graphitic-N and pyridinic-N and pyrrolic-N accounts for 93.60% of the four configurations above in Co–N– GA-1, which is higher than 82.46 at% of Co–N–GA-2, as shown in Table S3, Supporting Information.[40,41] The high-resolution Co 2p XPS spectrum of Co–N–GA-1 presented in Figure 7c can be classified into two doublets corresponding to Co-N (780.6 and 785.7 eV) and Co-O (796.2 and 803.3 eV).[42,43] Co– N–GA has the same features peak (Figure 7f ), but the Co-N ratio in Co–N–GA-1 reached 71.72%, which was higher than 58.89% in Co–N–GA-2. This confirmed that H2TPP played a protective role, generated more CoN, which is expected to positively impact on improving the catalytic activity. At the same time, the ratio of Co-N in Co–N–GA-1 and Co–N–GA-2 is higher than that of Co-O, which proves that the Co-N4 within the macrocyclic conjugated structure can effectively protect the central metal cobalt,

prevent the detachment of the central metal, and reduce the generation of oxides. Much more CoN content in Co–N–GA-1 than Co–N–GA-2 is expected to have better catalytic activity and stability for the former than the latter (vide infra). In one word, according to the above XRD, HRTEM, and XPS analyses, the active species in the electrocatalysts are both CoN and CoO, while Co-Nx units only existed in the CoTPP/H2TPP precursor instead of the catalysts. And CoN has better catalytic activity and stability than CoO, which has been confirmed by a series of contrast experiments between Co–N–GA-1 and Co–N–GA-2(vide infra).

#### 2.3. Electrochemical Characterization

The electrocatalytic ORR activities of the four catalysts, Co–N– GA-1, Co–N–GA-2, Co-N-CB-1, and GA, were first tested by both

Figure 7. High-resolution XPS spectra of a) C 1s, b) N 1s, c) Co 2p for Co-N-GA-1 and d) C 1s, e) N 1s, f) Co 2p for Co-N-GA-1.

cyclic voltammetry (CV) and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) in 0.1 M KOH. The CV curves of the four catalysts are shown in Figure S6, Supporting Information, a clear oxygen reduction peak appears in oxygen-saturated electrolyte but no corresponding peak appears in nitrogen-saturated electrolyte, which indicates that the four obtained catalysts have ORR electrocatalytic activity. Furthermore, LSV analysis demonstrates that Co-N-GA-1 exhibits higher activities with more positive shifts of onset and half-wave potentials ( $E_{\text{onset}} = 0.96 \,\text{V}$ ,  $E_{1/2} = 0.88 \,\text{V}$ ) than those of Co-N-GA-2 ( $E_{\text{onset}} = 0.90 \text{ V}, E_{1/2} = 0.83 \text{ V}$ ), Co-N-CB-1  $(E_{\text{onset}} = 0.85 \,\text{V}, \quad E_{1/2} = 0.78 \,\text{V}), \quad \text{and} \quad \text{GA} \quad (E_{\text{onset}} = 0.88 \,\text{V},$  $E_{1/2} = 0.70 \text{ V}$ ), even superior to 20 wt% Pt/C ( $E_{\text{onset}} = 0.94 \text{ V}$ ,  $E_{1/2} = 0.84 \,\mathrm{V}$ ), as shown in **Figure 8**a and Table S4, Supporting Information. The catalytic activities of both Co-N-GA-1 and Co-N-GA-2 are all better than those of Co-N-CB-1 and GA, indicating that the effective load of the Co-based active sites from CoTPP precursor on a GA matrix is important for promoting ORR performance. In addition, the catalytic performance of Co-N-GA-1 is higher than Co-N-GA-2. This indicated that the addition of H<sub>2</sub>TPP into the precursor can greatly improve ORR activity of the resulting catalyst, due to the formation of more CoN than CoO with smaller sized active sites in the former than in the latter. It is worth noting that the catalytic activity of Co-N-GA-1 is also superior to that of most of the Co-doped carbon catalysts reported so far in alkaline electrolyte, see Table S5, Supporting Information, but a lower Co loading content (only 1.67 wt%) was used in the present case. Considering the relatively expensive price of the Co metal among the transition metals, the present approach to efficiently load and isolate CoN active sites on graphene-deviated porous carbon provides a convenient and scalable method for the fabrication of high-performance ORR electrocatalysts.

To further understand the reaction mechanism, LSV tests of Co-N-GA-1 were conducted with a speed range of 400–2025 rpm, as shown in Figure 8b. In plotting the k-l diagram based on the test results, the electron transfer number (n) of Co-N-GA-1 is 3.99, indicating that the ORR reaction is a four-electron reaction in the presence of the obtained catalyst, see the inset of Figure 8b. This result matches well with the ORR behavior of Pt/C having an ideal electron transfer number (n) of 4.0, indicating the high ORR catalytic efficiency of Co-N-GA-1. The slightly lower electron transfer numbers of 3.75, 3.54, and 3.41 are obtained for Co-N-GA-2, Co-N-CB-1, and GA, respectively, Figure S7, Supporting Information. In addition, the catalytic selectivity of the catalysts was confirmed by the RRDE (rotating ring-disk electrode) test, as shown in Figure 8c. The results showed that the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> yield of Co-N-GA-1 was less than 5%, close to that of Pt/C, showing the good catalytic performance and perfect four-electron selectivity, as shown in Figure 8c. However, the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> yields of Co-N-GA-2, Co-N-CB-1, and GA were up to 17%, 20%, and 30%, respectively, implying the uncompleted 4-electron reaction process with lower ORR catalytic efficiency of the three catalysts compared to that of Co-N-GA-1.

Tafel slopes of Co-N-GA-1, Co-N-GA-2, Co-N-CB-1, and GA are calculated to be  $\approx$ 60, 82, 114, and 120 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>, respectively, as shown in Figure S8, Supporting Information. The smallest Tafel slope achieved for the Co–N–GA-1 among the four samples, which is also much lower than that of Pt/C  $(72 \,\mathrm{mV} \,\mathrm{dec}^{-1})$ , Figure S8, Supporting Information, illustrates the superior catalytic kinetics of Co-N-GA-1. Furthermore, Figure S9, Supporting Information, shows the electrochemical surface area (ECSA) of the Co-N-GA-1, Co-N-GA-2, Co-N-CB-1, and GA.

Among the four catalysts, Co-N-GA-1 had the largest ECSA value of 188 cm<sup>2</sup> [Co-N-GA-2 (138 cm<sup>2</sup>), GA (103 cm<sup>2</sup>), and Co-N-CB-1 (50 cm<sup>2</sup>)], which should be attributed to efficient exposure of the Co-based active sites on GA matrix during the pyrolysis process. Durability assessment of Co-N-GA-1 and Co-N-GA-2 is done by the i-t chronoamperometric response. As shown in Figure 8d, after 20 h of continuous operation, Co-N-GA-1 and Co-N-GA-2 retain 89% and 78% of their original current density, respectively, which was higher than 54% of Pt/C, indicating better stability of the two resulting catalysts. The better stability of Co-N-GA-1 than Co-N-GA-2 is likely due to the fact that there are more cobalt nitrides in the former than the latter, which are more stable than oxides. Furthermore, Co-N-GA-1 also exhibits a small change of the current after the injection of methanol, better than both Co-N-GA-2 and Pt/C, Figure S10, Supporting Information, indicating its superior methanol tolerance.

#### 2.4. Zinc-Air Battery Performance

Durability is crucial for catalysts used in zinc-air batteries. So the durability and chemical stability of the catalysts in zinc-air batteries are first analyzed through accelerated degradation test (ADT). [45,46] After the ADT test (10 000 cycles), half-wave potential of Co-N-GA-1 slightly shifted by 9 mV and Co-N-GA-2 shifted by 19 mV (Figure S11, Supporting Information), further proving the excellent stability of Co-N-GA-1. This is beneficial to its practical application. To explore the performance of Co-N-GA-1 in practical application, a zinc-air battery was assembled with Co-N-GA-1 and Pt/C as air cathode catalysts for a comparative study, respectively. As shown in Figure 9a, the battery composed of Co-N-GA-1 shows a higher open-circuit voltage (1.52 V) than Pt/C (1.47 V), and thus can light light-emitting diodes (LEDs), Figure S12, Supporting Information. The specific capacity of the Co-N-GA-1 battery at the discharge density of 20 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> is 787 mAh g<sup>-1</sup>, which is higher than the  $672 \, \text{mAh g}^{-1}$  of Pt/C, Figure 9b. The galvanostatic discharge test (5 mA cm $^{-2}$ ) also revealed the better performance of Co-N-GA-1 over Pt/C, with almost no voltage decay, reaching 1.24 V, which is higher than the 1.20 V of Pt/C, as shown in Figure 9c. In polarization, it is found that the Co-N-GA-1-based battery achieves higher output voltage than Pt/C, as shown in Figure 9d, because of its faster ORR kinetics. The power density is 110 mW cm<sup>-2</sup>, which is higher than the 78 mW cm<sup>-2</sup> of Pt/C, as shown in Figure 9d. The cycling performance of the Co-N-GA-1-based zinc-air batteries was recorded by employing galvanostatic discharging and charging at 5 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> for a total of about 300 cycles (Figure S13, Supporting Information). The voltage

gap between charge and discharge of Co–N–GA-1-based zinc-air battery is 0.85 V. As a result, Co–N–GA-1 exhibited excellent performance as reversible air electrode in the rechargeable zinc-air batteries, which are superior to Pt/C and most of the catalysts reported recently (Table S6, Supporting Information). This implied a good application prospect for Co–N–GA-1.

# 3. Conclusion

In this work, the lipophilic spongy graphene aerogel was skillfully used to effectively adsorb the CoTPP/H2TPP mixture dissolved in organic solvent that contains Co-N4 active units preanchored within the CoTPP molecules, resulting in the precursor CoTPP/H2TPP@OGA. Pyrolysis of this well-designed precursor leads to a Co–N–GA-1 catalyst with highly effective CoN active sites. This catalyst shows higher ORR activity than commercial Pt/C, in terms of a higher half-wave potential, superior durability, and tolerance to the methanol cross-over effect. Co–N–GA-1 was used as a catalyst to assemble zinc-air battery, which exhibited high peak power density and outstanding durability. The present work provided a new approach for efficient use of the Co-based active sites to prepare a high-performance ORR catalyst by a combination between payload and dispersion of Cocontaining species in a well-designed precursor.

## 4. Experimental Section

Chemical and Materials: 5,10,15,20-tetraphenylporphyrin (H2TPP), 5,10,15,20-tetrakis (phenyl) porphyrinato cobalt (II) (CoTPP), and the GO were synthesized according to the protocols described in the references reported previously.[30,47,48] All chemical reagents are analytical grade purity. The details are shown in the Experimental section (Supporting information).

Preparation of the Electrocatalysts: 10 mL of GO was added into 445 μL of ethylenediamine (EDA) under ultrasonication. The reaction was carried out at 95 °C for 8 h. After washing twice with pure water, the graphene hydrogel is obtained, and then freeze-dried to obtain the OGA,[49] Figure 1. 14 mg (20 mmol) of CoTPP and 25 mg (40 mmol) of H2TPP were completely dissolved in chloroform, achieving a mixed solution of CoTPP/H2TPP with a brick red color. And then 50 mg of OGA was immersed in the CoTPP/H2TPP mixed solution. After all of the solutions were completely absorbed on OGA, removing it for drying, resulted in the precursor of CoTPP/H2TPP@OGA, in which the CoTPP/H2TPP is deposited in situ on the OGA through a self-assembled process depending on the evaporation of chloroform solvent. The CoTPP/H2TPP@OGA was then subjected to thermal treatment in the N2 stream, ramped up to 900 °C at 5 °C min<sup>1</sup> and maintained for 2 h, resulting in the catalyst referred to as Co–N–GA-1 (as shown in Scheme 1). For comparison, a similar protocol was also used to fabricate Co–N–GA-2, Co-N-CB-1 and GA from the respective precursor of CoTPP@OGA (only CoTPP alone adsorbed on OGA without H2TPP involved), CoTPP/H2TPP@CB (CoTPP/H2TPP absorbed on commercial Vulcan XC-72 carbon black) and OGA.

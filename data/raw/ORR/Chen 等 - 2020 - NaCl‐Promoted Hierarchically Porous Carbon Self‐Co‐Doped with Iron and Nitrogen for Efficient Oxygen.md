Exploring low-cost, highly effective and durable nonprecious electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is the key issue for large-scale applications of fuel cell technology. However, preparation of Fe N C ORR catalysts using biomass without any external sources containing nitrogen and iron elements has rarely been reported. In this paper, hierarchically porous carbon self-co-doped with Fe and N promoted by NaCl has been successfully synthesized through a facile one-step pyrolysis method using pig blood curds (PBCs) without any external Fe and N. Besides, Fe and N are uniformly dispersed within the as-synthesized electrocatalysts. Electrochemical tests showed that the best performing Fe N C electrocatalyst exhibited superior ORR catalytic activity with a positive halfwave potential of 0.834 V vs. RHE and a high limiting current density of 5.6 mAcm <sup>2</sup> . Furthermore, the as-synthesized electrocatalyst also showed remarkable long-term stability as well as superior methanol tolerance, outperforming commercial Pt/ C. The facile synthesis of high-performance Fe N C electrocatalysts derived from PBCs using NaCl as the pore former provides fundamental insight and offers important guidelines for the future design of biomass-derived carbons in specific

## **1. Introduction**

Fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEV) have attracted worldwide attention for their high efficiency and low emission. Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), the pivotal process in renewable fuel cells, generally limits the efficiency of these fuel cells due to its intrinsically sluggish kinetics.[1–3] Regarded as the most effective ORR catalysts, platinum (Pt) and its alloys are still suffered from several critical problems, such as low abundance, high cost, low stability and methanol tolerance, which limit their wide applications.[4–7] Consequently, highly effective and durable nonprecious catalysts for ORR have been extensively studied, especially the porous carbon materials doped with heteroatoms and/or nonprecious transition metals.[3,8–14]

The porous carbon materials, which possess hierarchical porous structure with abundant macro-, meso- and microenergy applications.

pores, and well-ordered carbon skeletons with a proper degree of graphitization and large surface area, can facilitate the mass transfer, electron conduction and exposure of numerous accessible active sites towards the reaction, thus improving the ORR performance synergistically.[15–17] Large amounts of carbonbased ORR catalysts have been prepared which could effectively catalyze ORR and free from methanol crossover. Besides, carbon-based ORR catalysts are much less expensive and more abundant. Therefore carbon-based ORR catalysts have been regarded as the most likely to replace Pt-based catalysts.[17] With increasing exploration of carbon-based materials for ORR, heteroatom- doped carbon catalysts have been developed to be comparable or even better than the state-of-the-art Pt/C catalysts.[18–21] On one hand, the introduction of heteroatoms (N, P, Fe or Co etc.) into carbon matrix could effectively modify the charge redistribution which can change O2 chemisorption mode to effectively weaken O O bonding.[22,23] On the other hand, the introduction of heteroatoms could improve graphitization degree in pyrolysis which is favorable for conducting electrons in electrocatalysis.[24] Recently carbon materials doped with N or co-doped with N and Fe have been reported to effectively catalyze ORR.[28–30] For example, Guo et al synthesized Fe and N co-doped carbon nanotube@hollow carbon fibers derived from plant biomass as efficient catalysts for ORR.[29] However, some additional substances, such as hemin, iron porphyrin and ammonia etc. which are relatively expensive, harmful or environmentally unfriendly, are usually needed to be added during the preparation of such carbon-based electrocatalysts.[2,14,24] Besides, preparations of such carbonbased materials often require complicated steps or strict control of the processing environment.[31–33] Consequently, developing heteroatom-doped carbon-based catalysts with high

ORR catalytic activity by using harmless and low-cost renewable resources has been eagerly expected all the time.

In china, pig blood curds prepared by introducing coagulant NaCl into fresh pig blood has great yield. Hemin, a heme crystal purified from animal blood with Fe atom bonded to four N atoms, has been used as a Fe source to prepare catalyst for ORR.[14] Obviously pig blood curds contain heme, and importantly the Fe content of pig blood curds is about 0.50%. Besides, they contain large quantity of various biological proteins and N-rich amino acids which is of great significance for the preparation of heteroatom-doped catalysts using biomass.[17,34] Furthermore, several literatures have been reported that the addition of NaCl can be used as a selfsacrificing template for pores formation or a promotion for the graphitization at high pyrolysis temperature because of the molten salt effect.[34–35]

Herein, we report a facile one-step pyrolysis method for the synthesis of hierarchically porous carbon self-co-doped with Fe and N (Fe Nx@NC) using pig blood curds (PBCs) without any external Fe and N elements. Microstructure characterizations illustrated that Fe and N were uniformly dispersed in the nanoporous carbon matrix. The as-synthesized Fe Nx@NC shows excellent catalytic activity towards ORR. Electrochemical tests showed that the best forming carbon electrocatalyst exhibited superior ORR catalytic activity with a positive halfwave potential of 0.834 V (vs. RHE) and a high limiting current density of 5.6 mAcm <sup>2</sup> . Furthermore, the as-synthesized porous carbon electrocatalyst also showed remarkable long-term stability as well as superior methanol tolerance, outperforming Pt/C.

## **2. Results and discussion**

#### **2.1. Physical and Chemical Characterizations of PBCs-900**

PBCs-900 (The detailed synthesis and Characterizations of Fe/ N@NC catalysts shown in supporting information) shows the optimum catalytic activity, so detailed characterization has been mainly focused on the morphology and microstructure of PBCs-900. SEM images of PBCs-900 with different magnifications shown in Figure 1(a–c) present a block structure with a few obvious inhomogeneous distributed macro pores and many irregular cracks on the surface. Conversely, macropores and irregular cracks could not be observed in the SEM images of FB-900 with different magnifications shown in Figure 1(d-f), indicating the promotion of NaCl in pore formation.

The low-magnification TEM image of PBCs-900 shown in Figure 2a demonstrates a nanoporous structure. The highmagnification TEM images of PBCs-900 in Figure 2b and 2c further confirm the nanoporous structure without any obvious aggregated nanoparticles. High-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscope (HAADF-STEM) image and the corresponding elemental mappings of Fe, C and N are shown in Figure 2 (d-g). It can be seen from Figure 2 (e-g) that Fe and N are existed and uniformly distributed in the nanoporous carbon.

N2 adsorption-desorption tests were carried out to detail the specific surface area and porous structure of PBCs-900 and FB-900. The N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms of PBCs-900 indicates this catalyst belongs to type IV isotherms with H4 hysteresis loop in accordance with IUPAC classification [36, 38], consistent with the SEM images shown in Figure 1. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of PBCs-900 is 411 m2g <sup>1</sup> , about one time larger than that of FB-900, implying more exposed active sites of PBCs-900. The result of volume and distribution of pores calculated by the density functional theory (DFT) is shown in Fig 3b. It can be seen that most of nanopores are micropores (*<*2 nm) and little mesopores (2– 50 nm) and the distribution is between 0.3 nm to 10.0 nm. In contrast with FB-900, PBCs-900 has larger pore volume and

mesopores of PBCs-900 at 2.0–5.0 nm increased obviously. The addition of NaCl increased the porosities of PBCs-900 at high pyrolysis temperature.[35]

In order to further identify the nature of the as-synthesized catalysts, XRD patterns were recorded and presented in Figure 3c. The broad peak located at about 24°, corresponding to the (002) basal plane diffraction of graphitic structure, reveals the graphite-like structure and an asymmetric peak centered on about 44.5° is due to the lattice diffraction (101) of turbostratic structure.[39,40] It can be obviously known from Figure 3c that unwashed PBCs-900 contains a certain amount of sodium chloride. When the pyrolysis temperature reaches 1000°C, obvious diffraction peaks of ferric oxide are observed (Figure S1), indicating a break of Fe N bonds.

Raman spectroscopic analysis was also carried out to study the defect sites and disordered structure of carbon-based materials (Figure 3d). The D-peak and G-peak are the Raman characteristic peaks of C-crystals, which are located at 1340 cm <sup>1</sup> and 1580 cm <sup>1</sup> , respectively. The D band corresponds to the sp3 defect site on the graphite plane, mainly including vacancies and heteroatoms,[41] and the G-band is mainly attributed to the Raman-active E2 g symmetric in-plane symmetric vibration mode, which exists in sp2 hybridized graphitic carbon, including C C and C N.[42–44] Commonly, the extent of the defects or the degree of graphitization was indicated by the intensity ratio of the D-band and G-band (ID/IG) in heteroatom doped carbon-based catalysts.[44] As illustrated in Figure 3d and Figure S2, PBCs-900 exhibits the smallest ID/IG ratio among all the synthesized catalysts, indicating a higher graphitization degree, owing to that the addition of NaCl during the manufacturing process of PBCs can facilitate the carbonization of small organic molecular fragments during the high temperature pyrolysis treatment.[45,46]

XPS was further conducted to examine the elemental chemical state of the as- synthesized catalysts. From the XPS survey spectra of unwashed PBCs-900, PBCs- 900 and FB-900 shown in Figure 4a, it can be seen that C 1s, N 1s and O 1s signals are detected in PBCs-900 and FB-900 while Na 1s and Cl 1s are only detected in unwashed PBCs-900, consistent with the results of the XRD. The well fitted C 1s peaks of PBCs-900 in Figure 4b are located at 284.6, 285.1 286.2 and 288.2 eV, which can be assigned to sp2 graphitic carbon (C=C), sp3diamondlike carbon (C C), sp2 carbon atoms bonded to nitrogen (C N) and sp2 carbon atoms bonded to oxygen (O-C=O), respectively. By fitting N 1s high resolution spectra of the as-synthesized catalysts shown in Figure 4c and Figure S3, the deconvoluted Lorentzian-Gaussian multi-peaks at 398.1�0.3, 400.3�0.3, 401.1�0.3 and 402.4�0.3 eV can be assigned to pyridinic-N, pyrrolic-N, graphitic-N and oxidized-N species, respectively.[29,47–49] It can be seen from Figure 4c that the pyridinic-N and pyrrolic-N have been the main component of N 1s in PBCs-900 and FB-900. The contents of different N species of FB900, PBCs-800, PBCs-900 and PBCs-1000 are shown in Figure 4d and Figure S4. It can be seen that PBCs-900 possesses

N content of 5.19 (at. %), the highest among the as-synthesized catalysts. Besides, with the increase of the pyrolysis temperature, the percentage of pyridinic N decreases and the percentage of pyrrolic N maintains a relative stable value while the percentage of graphitic-N and oxidized-N increases. Previous studies have proved that pyridinic-N, pyrrolic-N and graphitic-N make a contribution to the electrocatalytic activity of ORR[47,50] and Fe species which is coordinated with pyridinic-N act as active sites for ORR[51]. The decreased percentage of pyridinic N mainly due to the break of Fe N bonds, which was proved by Fe2O3 peaks in the XRD patterns of PBCs-1000 shown in Figure S4. The high resolution Fe 2p XPS spectra in Figure S5 show quite weak characteristic peaks of trace iron (0.08 at. %), and the Fe content of PBCs-900 was measured to be 0.15 wt. % by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS).[29]

## **2.2. Electrochemical characterizations**

To evaluate the catalytic activity of the as-synthesized catalysts for ORR, cyclic voltammetric (CV) measurements were firstly performed using rotating disk electrode (RDE) in 0.1 M KOH solution saturated with nitrogen or oxygen. As illustrated in

**Figure 6.** (a) Chronoamperometric responses and (b) methanol tolerance test of PBCs-900 and Pt/C in oxygen saturated 0.1 M KOH solution at 0.60 V, (c) RDE polarization curves of PBCs-900 and acid-leached PBCs-900, (d) N 1s high-resolution XPS spectra of acid-leached PBCs-900, (e) contents and types of N species for PBCs-900 and acid-leached PBCs-900, (f) RDE polarization curves of PBCs-900 recorded with different time after addition of 10 mM KSCN in O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH with a rotation speed of 1600 rpm.

Figure 5a, PBCs-900 and FB-900 exhibit obvious cathodic ORR peaks in 0.1 M KOH solution saturated with O2, while not in N2 saturated 0.1 M KOH solution.

RDE measurements were further carried out in 0.1 M KOH solution saturated with oxygen. As shown in Figure 5b, the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) lines indicate that the onset potential of PBCs-900 is about 0.95 V, which is slightly smaller that that Pt/C (0.98 V). Figure 5b shows that PBCs-900 exhibits the better ORR catalytic activity with a high diffusion limiting current density (JL) of 5.6 mAcm <sup>2</sup> and a positive half-wave potential (E1/2) of 0.834 V, which is relatively comparable to the state-of-the-art Pt/C (0.845 V). Compared with other biomassbased ORR catalysts (Table S1), PBCs-900 shows better ORR catalytic activity.

Both the Koutecky-Levich (K L) equation origin from the LSV curves at different rotation speeds and RRDE linear sweep voltammogram were used to calculate the electron-transfer number and H2O2 yield of ORR for PBCs-900. As shown in Figure 5d, the electron-transfer number for PBCs-900 is about 3.88, which means that ORR conducted mainly as 4e on PBCs-900, and the average production of H2O2 shown in Figure 5e is lower than 20%. As shown in Figure 5f, Tafel slope of PBCs-900 is 76.3 mVdec <sup>1</sup> , nearly equal to that of Pt/C (75.6 mVdec <sup>1</sup> ), meaning that the transfer of first electron catalyzed by PBCs-

900 in ORR might be the rate-determining step in according with Pt.[12]

In addition to the high activity, the stability of PBCs-900 was also further evaluated by chronoamperometry. Figure 6a shows that the current density decay of PBCs-900 is about 20% which is smaller than that of Pt/C (48%) after 25000 s of testing at a limiting current density, indicating the excellent stability of PBCs-900. Notably, PBCs-900 shows better tolerance toward methanol crossover than Pt/C. As illustrated in Figure 6b after adding 2% (volume ratio) of methanol at about 1000 s, PBCs-900 shows little activity decrease while Pt/C showed a larger activity decrease, suggesting that PBCs-900 is free from methanol crossover. It has been reported that the addition of NaCl increases the porosity, specific surface area and graphitization degree of the catalysts, thereby enhancing the ORR catalytic activity of the Pt-free catalysts and free from methanol crossover.[34–35] Therefore, PBCs-900 is a good candidate for ORR.

To verify whether iron species play a role as the active sites, the control experiments were carried out. Firstly, PBCs-900 was leached in 3.0 M HCl solution at 60°C for 12 h to remove Fe element. As shown in Figure 6c, the acid-leached PBCs-900 shows apparently degraded ORR activity with E1/2 of 0.784 V, which is 50 mV lower than that of PBCs-900. As evident from XPS survey spectra (Figure S7), the spectra of PBCs-900 and acid-leaching PBCs-900 are almost same except the

peaks of Si 1s and Si 2p. After the acid leaching process, the N 1s high resolution spectrum and the contents of the total N species of acid-leached PBCs-900 were shown in Figure 6d and Figure 6e, respectively. It can be seen from the deconvoluted N 1s high-resolution spectra that the content of total N species and the percentage of pyridinic N in total N species for acidleached PBCs-900 decreased remarkably compared with that of PBCs-900, this may due to the wreck of Fe N bond and protonation pyridinic-N.[52]

On the other hand, it has been reported that SCN is poisonous for Fe Nx sites in the catalysis of ORR,[53] so the RDE measurements of the oxygen reduction activity of PBCs-900 in 0.1 M KOH with and without the addition of 10 mM KSCN were performed. It can be seen from Figure 6f that no obvious change occurs for the onset potential of PBCs-900 with and without SCN , but the E1/2 and JL of PBCs-900 with the addition of SCN decreases by ∼40 mV and ∼0.4 mAcm <sup>2</sup> , respectively. This result unambiguously confirmed that Fe Nx coordination sites should play a key role in the catalysis of ORR for PBCs-900. Based on the above analysis, it might be concluded that Fe Nx sites is of great importance for the catalytic activity enhancement of the PBCs derived N, Fe co-doped nanoporous carbon catalyst.

## **3. Conclusions**

In summary, we have successfully synthesized a self-Fe N-codoped hierarchically porous carbon via one step pyrolysis of PBCs promoted by NaCl. Fe and N elements are reserved and uniformly dispersed within the as-synthesized carbon electrocatalysts. The best forming sample PBCs-900 exhibits high BET specific surface area of 411 m2g <sup>1</sup> with pore size mainly below 10 nm. The Fe NX species in PBCs-900 could enhance the catalytic activity for ORR with E1/2 of 0.834 V and JL of 5.6 mAcm <sup>2</sup> . Besides, PBCs-900 shows high stability and superior tolerance to methanol crossover. The facile and cost effective synthesis of high-performance Fe/N@NC utilizing green and renewable PBCs may open up a new avenue for fuel cell technology industry application.

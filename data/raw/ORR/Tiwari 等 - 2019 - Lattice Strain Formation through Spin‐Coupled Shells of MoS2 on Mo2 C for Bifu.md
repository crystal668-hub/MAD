**Identifying effective means to improve the electrocatalytic performance of transition metal dichalcogenides in alkaline electrolytes is a significant challenge. Herein, an advanced electrocatalyst possessing shells of molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) on molybdenum carbide (Mo2C) for efficient electrocatalytic activity in alkaline electrolytes is reported. The strained sheets of curved MoS2 surround the surface of Mo2C, turning the inactive basal planes of MoS2 into highly active electrocatalytic sites in the alkaline electrolyte. The van der Waals layers, which even possess van der Waals epitaxy along (100) facets of MoS2 and Mo2C, enhance the spin coupling between MoS2 and Mo2C, providing an easy electron transfer path for excellent electrocatalytic activity in alkaline electrolytes and solving the stability issue. In addition, it is found that curved MoS2 sheets on Mo2C show 3.45% tensile strain in the lattice, producing excellent catalytic activity for both oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) (with** *E***1/2 = 0.60 V vs RHE) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) (overpotential = 1.51 V vs RHE at 10 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> ) with 60 times higher electrochemical active area than pristine MoS2. The unique structure and synthesis route outlined here provide a novel and efficient approach toward designing highly active, durable, and costeffective ORR and OER electrocatalysts.**

# **1. Introduction**

Developing renewable energy production and storage technologies represents one of the major scientific challenges to fulfill the needs for the utilization of sustainable energy.[1,2] Oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) and oxygen evolution reactions (OER) are the two most important electrochemical reactions for renewable energy storage and conversion technologies (e.g., fuel cells, metal–air batteries, and water splitting devices).[3–6] The development of highly active, stable electrocatalysts for both ORR and OER is key for electrochemical applications because the slow kinetics of these two reactions restrict their performance and commercialization in many applications (especially for rechargeable metal–air batteries).[7] Noble metals and their composites are good electrocatalysts for these applications; platinum (Pt) based nanocomposites are excellent electrocatalysts for the ORR, and ruthenium oxide (RuO2) and iridium oxide (IrO2)

based nanocomposites are considered the best electrocatalysts for OER.[8,9] Unitized regenerative fuel cells (URFC), which are single-unit electrochemical devices, require a bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst for reversible processes for electrochemical energy conversion.[10] However, the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen electrocatalytic electrodes and their poor stability remain hindrances to URFC development.[11] In this regard, finding efficient electrocatalysts for bifunctional activity is necessary since normally Pt is only active for ORR (inactive for OER) and RuO2/IrO2 is only active for OER (inactive for ORR).[12] The poor stability, scarcity, and high cost of noble-metal materials are also major barriers for large-scale implementation.[13] Therefore, extensive research has been devoted to the development of durable, highly efficient, low cost, bifunctional electrocatalysts for ORR and OER.[14,15]

In this respect, a wide range of alternative materials, such as nanocarbons (e.g., carbon nanotubes (CNT) and graphene) and their composites,[16] transition metal oxides,[17–25] transition metal carbides/nitrides[26–33] and their composites[34–38] have been investigated for oxygen electrocatalysis processes. Still, the low activity in alkali and neutral pH solutions and

the poor stability of transition metal-based molecular catalysts restrict their practical applications. More recently, attempts to obtain nonprecious metal electrocatalysts through layered transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs)<sup>[39,40]</sup> (e.g., MoS<sub>2</sub>) have been reported;<sup>[41–44]</sup> however, basal plane inactivity as well as low conductivity limit the use of TMDs.<sup>[45–50]</sup> Hybrid structures of TMDs and conductive carbon/transition metals may overcome these issues.<sup>[51–53]</sup> For example, vertical MoS<sub>2</sub> on carbon templates<sup>[54–56]</sup> and graphene wrapped metal/metal-sulfide nanoparticles have been synthesized for electrochemical applications.<sup>[57]</sup> Nonetheless, the weak bonding between the metals and carbon materials restricts stability and leads to inhomogeneity in electrochemical applications.<sup>[58]</sup>

Here, we propose a hybrid structure of TMDs and conductive carbide for a stable bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst, that is a core-shell structure of Mo<sub>2</sub>C-MoS<sub>2</sub>. Mo<sub>2</sub>C has high electrical conductivity (≈10<sup>5</sup> S cm<sup>-1</sup>) and exhibits efficient electrocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER)[59] but low reactivity in alkali electrolytes, resulting in poor ORR and OER activity. By combining Mo<sub>2</sub>C with an active ORR and OER electrocatalyst as a shell material, Mo<sub>2</sub>C can be advantageous as a core material. The advantages are: (i) The Mo<sub>2</sub>C core works as an electron conductor for the formation of oxygen radicals to be supplied to the active electrocatalytic sites of MoS2, (ii) the curvature of the Mo<sub>2</sub>C core turns catalytically inactive basal planes of MoS2 into strained, active sites for OER and ORR, (iii) similar epitaxial heterostructures (hexagonal; space group P63/mmc) of Mo<sub>2</sub>C and MoS<sub>2</sub> form ultrastable, core-shell interfaces for electron transfer and long-term usage without degradation, and (iv) protection of the Mo<sub>2</sub>C from alkali electrolytes by tightly surrounding MoS<sub>2</sub>. Core-shell structures of Mo<sub>2</sub>C and MoS<sub>2</sub> are synthesized by a facile systematic procedure, which includes

sulfur coating Mo<sub>2</sub>C followed by annealing in an MoCl<sub>5</sub> environment. It is revealed from Raman spectroscopy that high-quality MoS<sub>2</sub> layers are grown on Mo<sub>2</sub>C particles without clear evidence of covalent bonds between MoS2 and Mo2C from X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements. We believe 2D MoS<sub>2</sub> forms stable van der Waals layers on Mo2C. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) observations confirm that the as-synthesized core-shell structure partially contains well-defined, continuous MoS2 sheets in a heteroepitaxial relationship to the underlying crystalline Mo<sub>2</sub>C nanoparticles along (100) facets. The resultant structures have curved MoS<sub>2</sub> sheets on the core Mo<sub>2</sub>C, in which the 3.45% tensile strained MoS2 shows excellent electrocatalytic activity and durability toward both ORR (with  $E_{1/2} = 0.60 \text{ V}$  vs RHE) and OER (overpotential = 1.51 V vs RHE at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>), when benchmarked with commercial Pt/C (for ORR) and RuO2 (for OER) electrocatalysts under the same testing conditions. The higher electrocatalytic activity of core-shell sample can be attributed to an abundance of active sites, and lattice strain in the MoS<sub>2</sub> sheets is responsible for improving the kinetics for ORR/OER catalysis processes. Their electrocatalytic activities in terms of half-wave potentials for ORR and overpotential for the OER will be useful for many applications requiring superior bifunctional catalysts.

### 2. Results and Discussions

#### 2.1. Characterization of the Morphology and Structure

The core–shell structures of Mo<sub>2</sub>C and MoS<sub>2</sub> are synthesized by first coating Mo<sub>2</sub>C with S followed by annealing in the presence of a Mo source (MoCl<sub>5</sub>), as shown in **Figure 1**a (for details, refer

to the Experimental Section). In addition, we synthesized three different composites by annealing in 0.06, 0.125, and 0.25 mmol of  $MoCl_5$  (referred to as  $(MoS_2)_{0.06}Mo_2C$ ,  $(MoS_2)_{0.125}Mo_2C$ , and  $(MoS_2)_{0.25}Mo_2C$ , respectively) that contain different numbers of  $MoS_2$  sheets on the surface of the  $Mo_2C$  core particles. The reaction to form  $MoS_2$  sheets on  $Mo_2C$  can be described as

$$2\text{MoCl}_5 + 4\text{S} \rightarrow 2\text{MoS}_2 + 5\text{Cl}_2 \tag{1}$$

Active sites for electrochemical activities of the core-shell structure can be explained as follows: For the ORR, oxygen molecules are partially bonded with molybdenum (Mo) to generate O\* radicals because O2 molecules prefer to adsorb on the Mo sites in  $MoS_2$  rather than sulfur atoms sites, [60] and H+ ions are partially connected with sulfur atoms because of the low adsorption energy of H+ on S.[61] Moreover, the highly conductive Mo<sub>2</sub>C core promotes the one-step reaction for oxygen reduction to form H2O by quickly transferring the electrons. For the OER activity, OH- radicals are interconnected with sulfur atoms while the conductive core of Mo<sub>2</sub>C helps the charge transfer for formation of oxygen molecules. In addition, the relatively small (5%) lattice mismatch between MoS<sub>2</sub> (lattice parameters a = 3.16 Å, c = 12.28 Å; space group P63/MMC) and Mo<sub>2</sub>C (lattice parameters a = 3.01 Å, c = 4.73 Å; space group P63/MMC)<sup>[62]</sup> promotes the formation of partial van der Waals epitaxy along (100) facets of MoS2 and Mo2C. The stable van der Waals layers of MoS<sub>2</sub> enhance spin coupling between Mo atoms (d-orbital) of MoS2 and C atoms (p-orbital) of Mo<sub>2</sub>C, which helps fast electron transfer and solves the stability issues for efficient electrocatalytic activities.<sup>[48]</sup>

The core-shell Mo<sub>2</sub>C/MoS<sub>2</sub> is first confirmed by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). Figure 1b shows a typical HRTEM image of the as-obtained core-shell structured (MoS<sub>2</sub>)<sub>0.125</sub>Mo<sub>2</sub>C sample. This image clearly shows that the well-stacked MoS<sub>2</sub> sheets (0.61 nm interlayer distance) are well attached to the Mo<sub>2</sub>C particles. Both MoS<sub>2</sub> and Mo<sub>2</sub>C appear highly crystalline, with no significant defect formation or other phases observed. The HRTEM also shows that the MoS<sub>2</sub> shell completely wraps the Mo<sub>2</sub>C nanoparticles (see Figure S1, Supporting Information). Energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) mapping confirms the Mo, S, and C elemental configuration in the core-shell structures (see Figure S1, Supporting Information). The HRTEM shows that there is no residual strain in the Mo<sub>2</sub>C lattice (Figure 1c). However, there is 3.45% tensile strain (calculated from average lattice parameters changes in MoS2 as shown in Figure 1c and Figure S1, Supporting Information) in the MoS<sub>2</sub> lattice near the interface with Mo<sub>2</sub>C, which is associated with the bending of the MoS2 to conform to the core. The tensile strain in the lattice of MoS<sub>2</sub> for (MoS<sub>2</sub>)<sub>0.06</sub>Mo<sub>2</sub>C samples is comparably lower (1.78%) than  $(MoS_2)_{0.125}Mo_2C$  samples, this might be possible due to not making fully wrapped shells of MoS2 on the core Mo2C (shown in Figure S2, Supporting Information). In addition, no lattice mismatch is observed along (100) planes at the interface between the Mo<sub>2</sub>C core and the MoS<sub>2</sub> shell (Figure 1c). STEM observations confirm the lattice orientations and that MoS<sub>2</sub> forms in the 2-H phase while  $Mo_2C$  is  $\alpha$ -phase in the core–shell (shown in Figure 1d). These results suggest that even though Mo<sub>2</sub>C is in spherical shape, a certain level of van der Waals epitaxy is developed along

(100) facets of MoS<sub>2</sub> and Mo<sub>2</sub>C in the core-shell structure, which indicates Mo atoms in Mo<sub>2</sub>C and MoS<sub>2</sub> are commensurate with each other. By increasing the amount of Mo in the source from 0.06 to 0.125 mmol, we find that the fully wrapped core-shell structure is maintained while the thickness (number of sheets) of the MoS2 shell increases (Figure S2a, Supporting Information). However, increasing the Mo concentration in the source from 0.125 to 0.25 mmol leads to the breakdown of the core-shell structure (this leads to random MoS2 sheet growth, as seen in Figure S2b, Supporting Information). The average particle size of Mo<sub>2</sub>C is 15 nm and there is no core (Mo<sub>2</sub>C) size variation observed in the as-synthesized samples among the different compositions of MoS2 on Mo2C. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) images and corresponding EDS mapping of as-synthesized samples confirm the homogeneous distribution of Mo<sub>2</sub>C and MoS<sub>2</sub> core-shell structures (shown in Figure S3, Supporting Information).

The structural configuration of the as-synthesized Mo<sub>2</sub>C/MoS<sub>2</sub> core–shell structures is confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD). The XRD patterns of Mo<sub>2</sub>C, (MoS<sub>2</sub>)<sub>0.06</sub>Mo<sub>2</sub>C,  $(MoS_2)_{0.125}Mo_2C$ , and  $(MoS_2)_{0.25}Mo_2C$  are shown in Figure 2a. The XRD patterns in Figure 2a confirm that the MoS<sub>2</sub> is hexagonal (2H-, JCPDS 6-97). The single (002) reflection at  $2\theta = 14.20$ corresponds to a d-spacing of 0.615 nm, indicating a layered structure of the MoS<sub>2</sub> for all three as-synthesized compositions. Note that increasing the Mo content in the source leads to an increase in the relative intensity of the (002) reflection, however, the width of the peak initially increases from (MoS<sub>2</sub>)<sub>0.06</sub>Mo<sub>2</sub>C to  $(MoS_2)_{0.125}Mo_2C$ , and decreases from  $(MoS_2)_{0.125}Mo_2C$  to (MoS<sub>2</sub>)<sub>0.25</sub>Mo<sub>2</sub>C (likely associated with strain in the lattice of MoS<sub>2</sub> on the curved Mo<sub>2</sub>C core) (shown in Figure S4, Supporting Information). [63] The strain, calculated from MoS<sub>2</sub> (002) peak broadening, is 3.51% for (MoS<sub>2</sub>)<sub>0.125</sub>Mo<sub>2</sub>C, [64] which is consistent with that calculation based on the HRTEM observations (calculation of strain from XRD is explained in the Supporting Information). Furthermore, the molybdenum carbide (Mo<sub>2</sub>C) structure of all of the samples is indexed as hexagonal  $\alpha$ -Mo<sub>2</sub>C (space group P63/mmc; JCPDS 35-787). The single strong peak at  $2\theta = 39.40^{\circ}$  corresponds to the (101) reflection of Mo<sub>2</sub>C with *d*-spacing of 0.22 nm; the peaks at 37.94°, 34.33°, and 52.05° correspond to the (002), (100), and (102) planes of Mo<sub>2</sub>C, respectively. Annealing Mo<sub>2</sub>C in the presence of the Mo source shows a hexagonal  $\beta$ -Mo<sub>2</sub>C (JCPDS 45-1013) diffraction peak at  $2\theta = 25.96^{\circ}$ . The absence of sulfur peaks in the assynthesized samples indicates no sulfur impurities are present in the composites. Therefore, the XRD patterns are consistent with the growth of MoS<sub>2</sub> sheets on the Mo<sub>2</sub>C surface with the little intermixing.

We further confirmed the formation of the  $Mo_2C/MoS_2$  coreshell structures by examination of the vibrational modes of the as-synthesized samples via Raman spectroscopy (using an excitation wavelength of 514 nm), as shown in Figure 2b. The Raman spectra of each of the samples show  $E_{2g}$  (at 377 cm<sup>-1</sup>) and  $A_{1g}$  (at 407 cm<sup>-1</sup>) peaks, corresponding to the  $MoS_2$  inplane and out-of-plane vibrations, respectively. This confirms that the  $MoS_2$  sheets are well-stacked on  $Mo_2C$ . The intensity ratio of the  $A_{1g}$  and  $E_{2g}$  peaks increases gradually as the number of  $MoS_2$  layers increases, however, the peak broadening is most pronounced in  $(MoS_2)_{0.125}Mo_2C$  due to possible

strain in the lattice of MoS2. The Mo2C characteristic Raman peaks at 818 and 992 cm<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> correspond to MoCMo and MoC stretching vibrations, respectively. Raman peaks at 280 and 335 cm<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> correspond to E2g and A1g vibration modes of Mo2C. Annealing the Mo2C particle in the presence of the Mo source leads to a broadening of the MoC stretching vibrations peak due to the formation of β-Mo2C.[66]

We employed XPS to determine the chemical compositions of the Mo2C/MoS2 core–shell structure. The XPS spectra of the (MoS2)0.125Mo2C and Mo2C are shown in Figure 2c–f. A survey scan shows Mo3d and C1s peaks in the Mo2C spectra, while S2p peaks along with Mo3d and C1s peaks appear in the core–shell structured (MoS2)0.125Mo2C sample (Figure 2c). In addition, it is revealed from the survey spectrum that there is no peak corresponding to CS bonding, confirming that no covalent bond forms between Mo2C and MoS2 during synthesis of MoS2 on Mo2C. The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of Mo oxidation states is increased from 5.73 to 6.02 eV while FWHM of C oxidation states is decreased from 3.58 to 2.86 eV after growing MoS2 shell on Mo2C, which indicates spin coupling between Mo atoms and C atoms in the core–shell structures of Mo2C and MoS2. The elemental scan shows peaks at 162.14 and 163.32 eV corresponding to the S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2 states of S, respectively. This confirms the formation of MoS2 on the Mo2C surface (Figure 2d). The peaks at 232.56 and 235.73 eV indicate the Mo4<sup>+</sup> 3d5/2 and Mo4<sup>+</sup> 3d3/2 states of Mo, respectively, which are shifted toward lower binding energy after the formation of the MoS2 shell (Figure 2e). This may be associated with the higher electronegativity of S compared to C. Compositional analysis of (MoS2)0.06Mo2C, (MoS2)0.125Mo2C, and (MoS2)0.25Mo2C shows that MoS2 is in the appropriate stoichiometric ratio (Figure S5, Supporting Information). In addition, we have compared the XPS results of core–shell structured (MoS2)0.125Mo2C with blank MoS2. It is revealed from XPS results that corresponding peaks of both elements are well matched (Figure S6, Supporting Information). The absence of additional peaks in the XPS spectrum confirms that the assynthesized samples do not have any discernible impurities or additional phases.

## **2.2. Electrocatalytic Performance for Oxygen Reduction Reaction**

To investigate the electrocatalytic activity of as-synthesized samples for ORR, linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) is carried out in an O2-saturated 0.1 m KOH electrolyte on a rotating disk electrode (RDE) at a scan rate of 5 mV s<sup>−</sup>1 with a rotation rate of 1600 rpm (shown in **Figure 3**a). It can be seen that among the different amounts of MoS2, the (MoS2)0.125Mo2C sample shows the lowest overpotential: 0.76 V versus RHE, which is close to that of a Pt/C electrode (0.82 V vs RHE). Furthermore, (MoS2)0.06Mo2C and (MoS2)0.25Mo2C samples have overpotentials of 0.69 and 0.57 V versus RHE, respectively. The optimal performance of (MoS2)0.125Mo2C arises because of a trade-off between electron transfer and strain formation in the structural formation in the core–shell structures. Increasing the MoS2 content from (MoS2)0.06Mo2C to (MoS2)0.125Mo2C results in completely wrapped core–shell structures, which improves catalytic ORR activity by more effectively transferring electrons to the core Mo2C and abudance of active sites by lattice strain in MoS2. However, a further increase of MoS2 for the (MoS2)0.25Mo2C sample

**Figure 3.** Electrocatalytic performance for ORR: a) Linear sweep voltammetry of as-synthesized samples, b) RDE experiment of the (MoS2)0.125Mo2C sample, c) K–L plot for as-synthesized samples, d) plots for determination of the double-layer capacitance (*C*dl) for as-synthesized samples, e) cyclic voltammetry in O2 and N2 saturated electrolyte for (MoS2)0.125Mo2C sample, and f) long-term stability test (chronoamperometry at 0.24 V vs RHE) for the (MoS2)0.125Mo2C sample.

results in decreasing performance due to the poor formation of the core–shell structure and low intrinsic electrical conductivity of MoS2. The ORR activity of bare Mo2C (overpotential 0.55 V vs RHE) and MoS2 (overpotential 0.54 V vs RHE) is also measured for the comparisons with results of core–shell structures. In addition, the half wave potentials (*E*1/2) of the different samples are measured and summarized in **Table 1**. These results from control samples indicate the important role of the core–shell structure of Mo2C (as the conducting agent) and strained MoS2 sheets (as active sites for the catalytic activity), which both contribute to the synergetic effect for efficient ORR electrocatalyst.

To determine the electrocatalytic activity toward ORR performance, the electron transfer number (*n*e) and H2O2 production yield are very important indicators. To estimate the electron transfer number (*n*e), the LSV experiment is conducted at different rotation speeds with an RDE system for as-synthesized materials. LSV plots at different rotation speeds for (MoS2)0.125Mo2C sample are shown in Figure 3b. The corresponding Koutecky–Levich (K–L) plot of *J*−<sup>1</sup> versus <sup>ω</sup><sup>−</sup>1/2, at a potential of 0.24 V versus RHE, is plotted for assynthesized samples and shown in Figure 3c. To calculate the electron transfer number (*n*e), the Koutecky–Levich equation is used. Details of these equations and calculation of electron transfer number (*n*e) are described in the Supporting Information. The calculated *n*e values of as-synthesized samples are summarized in Table 1. The *n*e value for (MoS2)0.125Mo2C electrode is 3.72, which is very close to a commercially available Pt/C electrode material (3.99). However, the calculated *n*<sup>e</sup>

values of the (MoS2)0.06Mo2C and (MoS2)0.25Mo2C electrodes are 3.47 and 3.23, respectively. Furthermore, the calculated kinetic current density (*j*K) value for the (MoS2)0.125Mo2C electrode is 5.62 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2 at 0.24 V versus RHE, which is close to Pt/C (5.87 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2 at 0.24 V vs RHE). It is clear from electrocatalytic data toward ORR that the core–shell structure of Mo2C and MoS2 follows an efficient one-step, four-electron pathway over the entire potential range. Furthermore, the double-layer capacitances (*C*dl) are derived from the cyclic voltammogrametry (CV) to evaluate the effective surface area measurement (ECSA) (CV of different samples shown in Figure S8, Supporting Information). As shown in Figure 3d, the calculated *C*dl values are 0.03, 0.60, 1.10, and 1.92 mF cm<sup>−</sup>2 for pristine MoS2, (MoS2)0.25Mo2C, (MoS2)0.06Mo2C, and (MoS2)0.125Mo2C, respectively. Similar to the ORR activities, core–shell structured (MoS2)0.25Mo2C sample shows a drastic increase of catalytically active sites more than 60 times compared to the pristine MoS2. The electrochemical active areas of different as-synthesized samples along with their ORR activities are listed in Table 1.

To determine the ORR activity mechanism, cyclic voltammetry of (MoS2)0.125Mo2C sample is measured in N2- and O2-saturated 0.1 m KOH solutions at a scan rate of 5 mV s−<sup>1</sup> and shown in Figure 3e. It is found that the (MoS2)0.125Mo2C sample shows a substantial oxygen reduction process in the O2-saturated electrolyte, but not in the N2-saturated electrolyte. It is assumed that the core–shell structure of Mo2C and MoS2 makes energetically favorable conditions for O2 adsorption due to strain formation in lattice of MoS2. However, the spin

polarization of Mo2C atoms near the active MoS2 sheets plays a key role in enhancing the binding of O2. [67] Moreover, low protonation due to relatively weak OH bonding on the strained MoS2 hinders two rate-determining steps during the formation of H2O2 (H2O2 production yield of different samples are summarized in Table 1). The stability of core–shell structured (MoS2)0.125Mo2C sample toward ORR activity is analyzed by chronoamperometry measurement (*j* ∼ *t*) at a constant potential of 0.145 V versus RHE for 12 h and shown in Figure 3f. The current density of the (MoS2)0.125Mo2C sample is constant over 12 h of continuous operation. Notably, after 12 h of catalytic activity, TEM, XRD, and XPS of the (MoS2)0.125Mo2C sample indicate no change in the structure or chemical composition (shown in Figure S9, Supporting Information), indicating the robustness of the materials. Some slight differences in XRD could be attributable to electrolyte diffusion in the material. In addition, LSV has been measured after the stability test, illustrating that there is no shift in overpotential for the core–shell structured (MoS2)0.125Mo2C sample shown in the inset of Figure 3f.

## **2.3. Electrocatalytic Performance for Oxygen Evolution Reaction**

Furthermore, we have performed electrochemical measurements for OER activity by linear sweep voltammetry with a mass loading of 1 mg cm<sup>−</sup>2 in the O2-saturated 0.1 m KOH electrolyte with a rotation rate of 1600 rpm. LSV curves for the as-synthesized and commercially available RuO2 samples are shown in **Figure 4**a. It is found that the (MoS2)0.125Mo2C sample shows the lowest overpotential, 1.51 V versus RHE at 10 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2, which is very close to commercially available RuO2 (1.45 V vs RHE 10 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2), and compares favorably to many recently reported TMD OER catalysts.[42,43,68,69] This indicates that the core–shell structures of Mo2C and MoS2 are also effective toward OER because the strained MoS2 sheets provide catalytic active sites and the Mo2C improves the electrical conductivity. Moreover, the overpotentials for the (MoS2)0.06Mo2C and (MoS2)0.25Mo2C samples are 1.55 and 1.59 V versus RHE, respectively, which indicates a similar trend also occurs for the OER activity in terms of the amount of MoS2 on the Mo2C core. To confirm the intrinsic electrocatalytic activity of

as-synthesized core-shell structures of Mo<sub>2</sub>C and MoS<sub>2</sub>, we have normalized the LSV curves with ECSA for OER (shown in Figure S10, Supporting Information). It is revealed from the normalized LSV curves that (MoS2)0.125Mo2C possesses the highest electrochemical activity among as-synthesized samples, which is consistent with Figure 4a. Furthermore, to understand the OER kinetics of the as-synthesized core-shell structured samples, Tafel plots are fitted according to the LSV curves (shown in Figure 4b). It is found that (MoS<sub>2</sub>)<sub>0.125</sub>Mo<sub>2</sub>C sample shows the smallest Tafel slope (209 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>) among the as-synthesized samples, which is comparable to RuO2 (151 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>). This result explains the intrinsic reason why the (MoS<sub>2</sub>)<sub>0.125</sub>Mo<sub>2</sub>C sample exhibits excellent OER activity. The Tafel slopes of the as-synthesized samples are summarized in Table 2. Based on these results, the core-shell structure of Mo<sub>2</sub>C and MoS<sub>2</sub> exerts high OER activity, which is better than nonmetallic carbon materials or heterostructures of TMD and carbon materials.

To understand the core-shell structure effect on OER activity, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is performed at 1.44 V versus RHE. To know the electron transfer resistance ( $R_{ct}$ ), the Nyquist plot of the impedance spectrum of pristine MoS2 and core-shell structured samples are shown in Figure 4c. The plot for the samples has a semicircular domain, where the diameter corresponds to electron transfer resistance ( $R_{ct}$ ). The (MoS<sub>2</sub>)<sub>0.125</sub>Mo<sub>2</sub>C sample has  $R_{ct}$  of 148  $\Omega$ , which is ten times lower than pristine MoS2 and the lowest among reported MoS<sub>2</sub> hybrid structures with metal carbide. Moreover, the R<sub>ct</sub> values for (MoS<sub>2</sub>)<sub>0.06</sub>Mo<sub>2</sub>C and (MoS<sub>2</sub>)<sub>0.25</sub>Mo<sub>2</sub>C samples are 275 and 597  $\Omega$ , respectively. The  $R_{ct}$  value of  $(MoS_2)_{0.06}Mo_2C$ is higher than that of the (MoS<sub>2</sub>)<sub>0.125</sub>Mo<sub>2</sub>C sample because at 0.60 V fewer radicals form in (MoS<sub>2</sub>)<sub>0.06</sub>Mo<sub>2</sub>C, so charges are moving slower than in the (MoS<sub>2</sub>)<sub>0.125</sub>Mo<sub>2</sub>C sample. These results indicate that the core-shell structures of Mo<sub>2</sub>C and MoS<sub>2</sub> provide a lower resistance connection for electrons transfer for electrocatalytic activity toward ORR and OER. To gain insights into the long-term stability of core-shell structured sample, chronoamperometry measurements (j ~ t) are conducted at a constant potential of 1.54 V versus RHE for the  $(MoS_2)_{0.125}Mo_2C$  sample (shown in Figure 4d). It can be seen that in the initial hour current density increases, which may occur due to increased access of the electrolyte between interfaces of MoS2 and Mo2C. However, after the initial hour, the current density remains constant, thereby confirming that the material possesses good stability in alkaline conditions. In addition, the core-shell structured (MoS<sub>2</sub>)<sub>0.125</sub>Mo<sub>2</sub>C sample shows a similar overpotential after 12 h of continuous electrolysis, confirming the robustness of the catalytic behavior of this material toward OER activity (the inset of Figure 4d). In

addition, the structure and chemical compositions of materials show a similar structure and chemical state after stability test confirming the high stability of core–shell structure (shown in Figure S11, Supporting Information). However, S2p Mo3d, and C1s peaks shift in XPS analysis of the core–shell structures sample after continuous electrocatalytic activity, which might be possible due to partial oxidation of the surface of

MoS<sub>2</sub>, and partial diffusion of electrolyte on the interface of the core–shell structures during electrocatalytic activity. <sup>[48]</sup>

#### 3. Conclusion

In summary, we have synthesized a core-shell nanostructure of Mo<sub>2</sub>C and MoS<sub>2</sub>. The core-shell nanostructure is an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst in alkaline electrolyte, which shows excellent electrocatalytic performance toward both ORR (with  $E_{1/2} = 0.60 \text{ V}$  vs RHE) and OER (overpotential = 1.51 V vs RHE at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>) with 60 times higher electrochemical active area than pristine MoS<sub>2</sub>. Curved MoS<sub>2</sub> sheets on the Mo<sub>2</sub>C surface possess lattice strain, providing efficient active sites for electrocatalytic activity (unlike basal planes of MoS2), while the Mo2C core provides a conducting channel for fast electron transfer (which is essential for oxygen radical formation for efficient electrocatalysis). In addition, low defect, van der Waals layers of MoS<sub>2</sub>, partially possessing van der Waals epitaxy along (100) facets of MoS2 and Mo2C, increase the stability of the core-shell structure and provide efficient pathways for transferring electrons by spin coupling, leading to high activities for both ORR and OER. Controlling the thickness of the MoS<sub>2</sub> shell on the Mo<sub>2</sub>C core can be used to optimize ORR activity; which is maximized at 5–7 layers of MoS<sub>2</sub>, ((MoS<sub>2</sub>)<sub>0.125</sub>Mo<sub>2</sub>C), which for ORR is close to that of commercial Pt/C catalysts. This sample also simultaneously exhibited outstanding OER activity close to the best-known OER catalyst (RuO<sub>2</sub>). Our novel core-shell design of a transition metal dichalcogenide on a conductive metal carbide particles provides an efficient approach to produce a hybrid, bifunctional, highly active, durable, cost-effective, and noble metal-free electrocatalysts, which may be applicable to future energy conversion devices (e.g., fuel cells and metal-air batteries).

## 4. Experimental Section

Material Synthesis: First, 200 mg Mo $_2$ C was mixed with 400 mg sulfur in CS $_2$  solution by stirring for 3 h. The resulting mixture was dried at room temperature to evaporate the CS $_2$  solvent. For preparation of the core—shell structure, 0.125 mmol of molybdenum chloride (MoCl $_5$ ) was dissolved in ethanol and the resulting solution was grinded with the S-Mo $_2$ C mixture with a mortar. The resulting mixture was dried in oven at 65 °C. To form the MoS $_2$  sheets, the resulting mixture was annealed with sulfur in an Ar atmosphere at 700 °C for 30 min to allow reaction with the incorporated sulfur and MoCl $_5$ . Three composites with different amounts of MoCl $_5$ : 0.06 mmol MoCl $_5$  ((MoS $_2$ ) $_{0.06}$ Mo $_2$ C), 0.125 mmol MoCl $_5$  ((MoS $_2$ ) $_{0.125}$ Mo $_2$ C), and 0.25 mmol MoCl $_5$  ((MoS $_2$ ) $_{0.25}$ Mo $_2$ C) were synthesized.

Chemical and Microstructural Characterizations: The microstructures, morphology, and chemical compositions of as-prepared samples were

investigated by a TEM (KARA, Titan cubed G2 60-300 TEM), a FESEM (FBI Company, Magellen400), a powder X-ray diffractometer (Cu Kα1 radiation, (Rigaku, SmarLab)), and X-ray photospectroscopy (Thermo VG Scientific, K-alpha). The Raman analysis of the samples was done with laser 532 nm.

*Electrochemical Characterizations*: First, 4 mg of as-synthesized materials was mixed in a solution, which contains 660 µL of deionized (DI) H2O, 220 µL of ethanol, and 80 µL of a Nafion 117 solution (5%) by ultrasonication for 2 h. Then, 3 µL of as-prepared slurry was then dropcasted on a rotating disk electrode (*d* = 3 mm). Then electrodes were dried in oven at 65 °C for overnight. Electrocatalytic investigation was done with VersaSTATE 3 (principle applied research) electrochemical workstation equipped with rotating disk electrode system (AMETEK, principle applied research, 616B). The electrochemical performance was carried with a three-electrode system (working electrode is the active material/glassy carbon, the reference electrode is Ag/AgCl in 3 m KCl, and the counter electrode is a Pt mesh) in 0.1 m KOH (pH = 11) electrolyte for both ORR and OER activities. All of the potentials are calibrated to a RHE, *E*RHE = *E*Ag/AgCl + 0.196 + 0.0591 pH V.

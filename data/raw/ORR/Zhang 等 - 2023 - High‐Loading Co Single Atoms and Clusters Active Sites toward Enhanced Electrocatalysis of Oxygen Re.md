*Mengtian Zhang, Hao Li, Junxiang Chen, Fei-Xiang Ma, Liang Zhen, Zhenhai Wen,\* and Cheng-Yan Xu\**

**The development of precious-metal alternative electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is highly desired for a variety of fuel cells, and single atom catalysts (SACs) have been envisaged to be the promising choice. However, there remains challenges in the synthesis of high metal loading SACs (>5 wt.%), thus limiting their electrocatalytic performance. Herein, a facile self-sacrificing template strategy is developed for fabricating Co single atoms along with Co atomic clusters co-anchored on porous-rich nitrogendoped graphene (Co SAs/AC@NG), which is implemented by the pyrolysis of dicyandiamide with the formation of layered g-C3N4 as sacrificed templates, providing rich anchoring sites to achieve high Co loading up to 14.0 wt.% in Co SAs/AC@NG. Experiments combined with density functional theory calculations reveal that the co-existence of Co single atoms and clusters with underlying nitrogen doped carbon in the optimized Co40SAs/AC@NG synergistically contributes to the enhanced electrocatalysis for ORR, which outperforms the state-of-the-art Pt/C catalysts with presenting a high halfwave potential (***E***1/2 = 0.890 V) and robust long-term stability. Moreover, the Co40SAs/AC@NG presents excellent performance in Zn–air battery with a high-peak power density (221 mW cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> ) and strong cycling stability, demonstrating great potential for energy storage applications.**

# **1. Introduction**

Renewable energy conversion and storage systems have been extensively explored to relieve the energy crisis and environmental problem.[1,2] Fuel cells and metal– air batteries are considered as a promising candidate since their high theoretical energy density, high-energy efficiency, and zero carbon emission.[3–5] However, designing high-performance electrocatalysts to accelerate the sluggish kinetics of four-electron oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) remains one of the crucial challenges for the large-scale commercialization of these technologies.[6,7] Up to now, platinum group metal (PGM) catalysts have been identified as the benchmarked electrocatalysts for ORR. However, the prohibitive cost, scarce abundance, and poor methanol tolerance and stability of PGM catalysts terribly hinder their industrial applications.[8–10] Even though great efforts have been devoted to replace PGM catalysts with low-cost catalysts, i.e., transition metal nitrides, carbides, and metal-

free carbon-based materials,[11–14] they are still unsatisfactory owing to their low activity or undesired stability.

Recently, single-atom catalysts (SACs) with maximum atomic utilization efficiency, tunable coordination environments, and unsaturated metal coordination exhibit high activity, good/ robust stability, and high selectivity for multiple electrochemical reactions, such as hydrogen evolution, CO2 reduction, methane conversion, oxygen reduction, and other electrochemical reactions.[15–20] However, there are some issues existing for utilizing SACs in practical applications. One issue is that the catalytic activity of SACs is often limited by the number of active sites, since most SACs are usually prepared with limited loadings (typically <5 wt.%)[21–23] to minimize metal agglomeration during the synthesis process. Another issue is the stability of these anchored single atoms. Due to the high-surface free energy of single metal atoms, the atoms are thermodynamically unstable and easy to agglomerate into nanoparticles during the long-term catalytic process, resulting in a reduced catalytic activity of SACs.[24–29] Thus, remarkable endeavors have been devoted to the development of high-metal loading and

high-stability SACs. For instance, Choi et al.[30] reported an impregnation–adsorption method to create Pt SACs with a high metal loading of 5 wt.% using the zeolite-templated substrate with abundant sulfur atoms (17 wt.% S). Xin et al.[31] successfully synthesized Mo SACs with a Mo loading up to 9.54 wt.%. Under the pyrolysis of hydroxylamine hydrochloride, the produced NH3-etched carbon offers sufficient anchoring sites for Mo atoms. Jiang et al.[32] prepared Fe SACs on N-doped graphene with the assistance of hemin porcine and dicyandiamide as precursors. The high N content guarantees plentiful anchoring sites for the Fe single atoms, yielding Fe loading as high as 7.7 ± 1.3 wt.%. All the above-mentioned strategies are based on creating more anchoring sites. Especially, creating more anchoring sites on the appropriate support, such as ligands, uncapped sites, vacancies, or defects, is an effective way to achieve high-metal loading and robust stability.[33–36]

Heteroatoms-doped graphene is an ideal support for anchoring and stabilizing single-atom sites.[37,38] Among many heteroatoms, including N, S, P, and B, N atoms are a good choice owing to its atomic size and electronic configuration. The similar atomic radius of N with C atoms can prevent the lattice mismatch after introducing the N into the carbon skeleton. Also, N atoms have one free electron more than C atoms, which is conducive to the reactions (e.g., ORR) that require electron participation.[39,40] Previous studies have reported that four types of nitrogen configurations (pyridinic-N, graphitic-N, pyrrolic-N, and N-oxide) are responsible for the improved ORR activity.[41] Among them, pyridinic N, in which N atoms that substitute for C atoms at the defects or edges of graphene, can provide lone electron pair and thus facilitate the adsorption of oxygen molecules, improving the onset potential for ORR. Graphitic N, in which N atoms, that substitute for C atoms in the graphite planes, is beneficial to increase the limiting current density.[42,43] Therefore, the synthesis of N-doped graphene support with pyridinic N or graphitic N dominated is critical to promote their ORR performance. Meanwhile, a highly porous carbon supports and possesses good conductivity and exposes a large number of active sites for facilitating the electrocatalytic reactions. Besides, constructing SACs with multiple active sites is a viable strategy to enhance the ORR performance. The multiple metal sites, such as atomic clusters anchored on the N-doped carbon substrate shows the optimized adsorption– desorption for ORR owing to the synergistic effect between the multiple metal centers and the asymmetric electron distribution around the metal sites.[44–46] Thus, the co-existence of single metal atoms and clusters holds the great potential to optimize the catalytic performance. Hence, it is highly desirable to explore a facile strategy to realize high loading single atoms and clusters on N-doped graphene for improving ORR performance.

Bearing the above-mentioned points in mind, Co single atoms with few atomic clusters co-anchored in porous nitrogen-doped graphene (Co SAs/AC@NG) was developed via a self-sacrificing template strategy. The layer g-C3N4 produced in the low temperature pyrolysis of dicyandiamide was acted as the temporary templates to confine the polymerization of carbon intermediates and keep homogeneous distribution of Co-containing precursor. Subsequently, the layer g-C3N4 was used as a nitrogen-rich polymer leads to high nitrogen dopant and further offer abundant anchoring sites to stabilize Co metal atoms during the pyrolysis process. This strategy endows a high Co loading up to 14.0 wt.% in the Co SAs/AC@NG. The optimized Co40SAs/AC@NG presents outstanding performance toward ORR in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte with a half-wave potential of 0.890 V, exceeding that of benchmark Pt/C catalyst. The excellent ORR performance is attributed to the high loading Co active sites, high N species, and abundant porous structure. Furthermore, when applied to assemble the air cathode in Zn– air battery, the Co40SAs/AC@NG shows good performance, including high-power density and robust cycling stability.

# **2. Results and Discussion**

#### **2.1. Synthesis and Characterization**

The low cost and environment-friendly graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) with high nitrogen content (57.1 at.%), easily produced by pyrolysis from widely available nitrogen incorporated precursors like dicyandiamide (DCA), is a promising template for firmly trapping high loading single-atom and cluster.[47,48] As illustrated in **Figure 1**a, the fabrication process of Co SAs/ AC@NG was prepared via a g-C3N4 based self-sacrificing template approach. First, glucose, DCA and certain amount of CoCl2·6H2O were fully mixed as precursors. Afterward, the resulted mixture was annealed in an argon atmosphere. During a low temperature pyrolysis process (550 °C), the DCA was condensed into layered g-C3N4, constructing a temporary layer template to confine the polymerization of carbon intermediates and keep uniform distribution of Co-containing precursor. Upon annealing at higher temperature (800 °C), the g-C3N4 template was acted as sacrificing templates and nitrogenrich polymer, completed decomposition and released a large amount of carbonized gaseous. This process creates porous carbon structures with plentiful defective sites and high-level nitrogen doping, contributing to the abundant anchoring sites to stabilize Co metal atoms. Meanwhile, the carbon intermediates were carbonized to form a conductive carbon skeleton, leading to in situ formation of high-density cobalt single atoms with fewer clusters embedded in the as-formed nitrogen-doped graphene (Co SAs/AC@NG). There is no need for subsequent template removal process. To explore the effects Co content of Co SAs/AC@NG catalysts on the electrocatalytic activity, a set of Co SAs/AC@NG samples was prepared by varying the initial Co salt amount from 0 to 40 mg, and denoted as NG, Co10SAs/AC@NG, Co20SAs/AC@NG, and Co40SAs/AC@NG, respectively.

The morphology of Co SAs/AC@NG samples were first characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM). As revealed in Figure S1 (Supporting Information), all samples are composed of abundantly wrinkled nanosheets, which originates from the morphology of soft template (g-C3N4). Transmission electron microscope (TEM) was used to investigated a series of Co SAs/AC@NG samples (Figures S2 and S3, Supporting Information). Take the Co40SAs/AC@NG as an example, ultrathin graphene layers (≈8–9 layers) with abundant pores are clearly observed (Figure 1b–f), which can expose more defect sites and enhance mass transport during electrochemical

reaction process.[49,50] It should be noted that no Co nanoparticles can be found from the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images, in line with the ring-like selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern results without Co diffraction spots (Figure 1g). Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) confirms the existence of C, N, and Co elements in the Co40SAs/ AC@NG (Figure S4, Supporting Information).

To further identify the structural features at atomic level, aberration-corrected high-angle annular dark-field scanning TEM (AC HAADF-STEM) was utilized in Co SAs/AC@NG samples. **Figure 2**a,d,g clearly show plenty of isolated bright dots, corresponding to the atomically dispersed Co single atoms. It should be noted that the density of Co single atoms is enhanced with the increase of Co content in Co SAs/AC@ NG samples (Figure 2a,d,g). Inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) analysis was conducted, implying that the Co content is 3.25, 6.4, and 14 wt.% in Co10SAs/AC@NG, Co20SAs/AC@NG, and Co40SAs/AC@NG,

respectively. In addition to the single atoms, a few Co clusters are also visible (Figure 2b,e,h). The high Co loading in N doped graphene support could lead to more defect sites, which are beneficial for electrocatalytic performance. HAADF-STEM and EDS mapping confirms the uniform distribution of C, N, and Co elements throughout the carbon matrix (Figure 2c,f,i).

A set of Co SAs/AC@NG samples were further characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements. As shown in Figure S5a, (Supporting Information) all four samples present only two broad peaks of the (002) and (100) crystallographic planes of graphite (JCPDS No. 26–1079). Moreover, the (002) diffraction peak at ≈25.5° is shift negatively relative to the standard graphite (≈26.6°), suggesting a large interlayer distance induced by abundant nitrogen doping, which is expected to facilitate the mass transfer during the electrochemical reactions.[51,52] No peaks associated with crystalline cobalt species

are observed, which is good agreement with the aberration-corrected HAADF-STEM results. Figure S5b (Supporting Information) presents the Raman spectra for a set of Co SAs/AC@NG and NG samples, in which two characteristic peaks at ≈1361 (D band) and ≈1577 cm<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> (G band) are observed. Notably, a higher *I*D/*I*G peak intensity ratio is obtained on the Co SAs/AC@ NG (1.05–1.12) than that of NG (1.03) sample and the value increases gradually as the Co content increases, in which the Co40SAs/AC@NG displays the largest *I*D/*I*G value, reflecting a large number of defects in the Co40SAs/AC@NG and thus benefit the promoting of electrocatalysis activity.[53–55] To determine the specific surface area and pore structures, nitrogen adsorption/desorption measurements of a series of Co SAs/AC@ NG and NG samples were carried out. Co SAs/AC@NG and NG samples manifest a type IV isotherm, with a high surface area range from 194.3 to 280.0 m2 g<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> . The corresponding pore size distribution of curves is shown in Figure S6 (Supporting Information), indicating the Co SAs/AC@NG and NG samples possess hierarchical meso-macro porous structure. Such porous structures in the Co SAs/AC@NG may be attributed to the release of massive amounts of nitrogen-containing gas during the annealing process. The large surface area and abundant porous features of Co40SAs/AC@NG are conducive to provide the accessibility of active sites and accelerate mass transfer during electrocatalysis, and thus boost the electrochemical performance.[56,57]

This powerful self-sacrificing template strategy was extended to synthesize other transition metal single-atom catalysts (TM SAs/AC@NG, TM = Ni, Fe) with high metal loading, as exhibited in Figures S7 and S8 (Supporting Information). XRD pattern demonstrates no metallic peaks can be observed in TM SAs/AC@NG catalysts. The SEM, TEM, and HAADF-STEM images of TM SAs/AC@NG display wrinkled nanosheets with abundant pores features, and no nanoparticles can be observed. The EDX mapping images show the uniform distribution of C, N, and Ni/Fe elements on the carbon substrate. By adjusting the amounts of metal precursors, the maximum metal loadings of Ni and Fe were 10.5 and 8.3 wt.%, respectively.

# **2.2. Electronic and Coordination Structures**

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was employed to investigate the chemical compositions and valence states with Co SAs/AC@NG and NG samples. XPS survey spectra in Figures S9a and S10a,d,g (Supporting Information) confirm the presence of C, N, O, and/or Co elements. The high-resolution C 1s spectr reveal the existence of C-N group, indicating the successful doping of N into carbon during the annealing process (Figures S9b and S10b,e,h, Supporting Information). For the high-resolution Co 2p spectra, two peaks centered at 780.8 and 796.7 eV (Figure S10c,f,i, Supporting Information), corresponding to Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2 of Co2<sup>+</sup>, respectively, implying Co species in Co SAs/AC@NG is present as Co (II) state rather than metallic state. According to the XPS results, the Co contents of Co40SAs/AC@NG was calculated to be 2.8 at% (12.1 wt.%), which is close to the Co loading based on the ICP tests. The N 1s spectra of Co SAs/AC@NG and NG samples show three types nitrogen species, including pyridinic N, graphitic N, and N-oxide (**Figure 3**a). The nitrogen species of Co SAs/AC@NG and NG dominated by pyridinic N and graphitic N, which could enhance the onset potential, limiting current density and accelerate the 4 e- transfer path for promoting ORR performance.[58–60] Particularly, the percentage of pyridinic N significantly increases from 48.0% for NG to 71.2% for Co40SAs/AC@NG, while the graphitic N decreases from 48.2% to 23.1% (Figure 3b), indicating that pyridinic N is more favorable to coordinate with Co atoms to form Co-N*<sup>x</sup>* moieties.[61–63] This phenomenon could be attributed to the increased Co content can lead to more defects sites, thus promoting the transformation of a higher proportion of pyridinic N.[64] It is worth mentioning that the total N contents in all samples is higher than 18 at% (Table S1, Supporting Information). The ultrahigh nitrogen doping content is expected to effectively alter the electronic structure and facilitate the O2 adsorption.[65] Above results prove that the nitrogen species can be tuned by varying the mass ratio of the metal precursors. The correlation between the nitrogen species and catalytic activity will be further studied.

To probe the local atomic coordination and electronic structure of Co species in Co40SAs/AC@NG, X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectra were performed. X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectrum of Co40SAs/AC@ NG was analyzed using Co foil, CoO, and Co3O4 as reference. As shown in Figure 3c, the Co K-edge absorption position of Co40SAs/AC@NG is different from that of Co foil and similar to that of CoO, implying that the valence state of cobalt is close to +2. The Fourier transformed (FT) extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy of Co40SAs/AC@ NG in Figure 3d shows a major peak located at ≈1.41 Å, corresponding to the Co-N(O) coordination;[66,67] Another weak peak is detected around 2.22 Å that ascribes to Co-Co scattering pathway, suggesting the existence of Co clusters. Noted that the peak is not obvious implies that the size of Co clusters shown be very small.[68,69] The wavelet transform (WT) contour plots of Co40SAs/AC@NG was employed to identify the adjacent atomic configuration with the similar bond length. Apparently, one intensity maximum peak is detected at ≈3.80 Å<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> , implying the predominance of Co-N(O) coordination (Figure 3e; Figure S11, Supporting Information). Besides, the WT contour plots show a weak peak at high **k** values (≈7 Å<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> ) that could be assigned to Co-Co scattering paths. Additionally, the EXAFS fittings result confirms that the average coordination number (CN) of Co-N(O) is determined to be 3.7±0.3 (Figure 3f; Figure S12 and Table S2, Supporting Information). Combined with the XPS N1s results and previous structural identification in the literature,[70,71] it is very likely that the Co-N4 moiety is the dominant active center in the Co40SAs/AC@NG. These coordinatively unsaturated Co sites are desired for efficient ORR catalysis. The CN of Co-Co are 0.2±0.1 for Co40SAs/AC@NG, indicating fewer Co clusters formed in Co40SAs/AC@NG.

#### **2.3. Electrocatalytic ORR Performance**

As aforementioned, the Co40SAs/AC@NG possess high loading Co active sites and rich pore structure, which is expected to show high electrocatalytic performance. The electrocatalytic

performance of a series of Co SAs/AC@NG, NG, and commercial Pt/C (20 wt.% Pt) was evaluated in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte for ORR. For comparison, the electrocatalytic activities of Co NPs@NCNTs was also evaluated as references. Note that when the Co precursors content was further increased to 60 mg, the Co species are agglomerated to Co nanoparticles (NPs) that are anchored on the nitrogen doped carbon nanotubes supports (denoted as Co NPs@NCNTs) (Figures S13 and S14, Supporting Information). The in situ formed carbon nanotubes were be catalyzed by the Co species.[72,73] As shown in Figure S15 (Supporting Information), in contrast to the featureless cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves in N2-saturated solution, the well-defined cathodic peaks appeared in O2-saturated solution indicates the ORR catalytic capability of Co SAs/AC@NG. The NG catalyst

displays a much lower oxygen reduction peak than those of Co SAs/AC@NG, reflecting the important role of Co active sites on boosting ORR activity. The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves displayed in **Figure 4**a indicate that the Co40SAs/AC@ NG exhibits the best performance among all related catalysts, featuring a higher half-wave potential (*E*1/2 = 0.890 V) than those of Co NPs@NCNTs (0.846 V), NG (0.684 V), and Pt/C (0.848 V), implying the critical role of Co single atoms and Co clusters for boosting ORR performance in Co40SAs/AC@ NG. Such excellent performance is superior to many previously reported advanced ORR catalysts in the alkaline environment (Table S3, Supporting Information).[74–76] Notably, the *E*1/2 value of Co40SAs/AC@NG is higher than the Co10SAs/AC@ NG (0.802 V) and Co20SAs/AC@NG (0.850 V), suggesting the

nitrogen species could effectively adjust the ORR activity, and a higher content of pyridinic N is more favor to the enhanced ORR performance.

To evaluate the contribution of Co clusters in the Co SAs/ AC@NG catalysts for ORR performance, the Co40SAs@NG catalyst was prepared from Co<sub>40</sub>SAs/AC@NG with acid etching treatment. It can be seen from the AC HAADF-STEM images in Figure S16 (Supporting Information), after acid etching, the Co clusters can be hardly found, implying the acid-unstable Co clusters were effectively removed, while the acid-resistant Co-N<sub>4</sub> sites can be well preserved.<sup>[77]</sup> Based on the LSV curves, Co<sub>40</sub>SAs/AC@NG exhibits higher catalytic activity, with a more positive  $E_{1/2}$  than that of Co<sub>40</sub>SAs@NG (0.855 V, Figure S17, Supporting Information), revealing that the existence of Co clusters plays a company effect in boosting electrocatalysis activity.

The outstanding ORR activity can be further verified by the kinetic current density (Jk) and Tafel slope of the

Co<sub>40</sub>SAs/AC@NG. Co<sub>40</sub>SAs/AC@NG exhibits a much higher  $J_k$  value of 17.070 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> at 0.85 V, which is 3.5 times higher than that of Pt/C (4.845 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, Figure 4b), demonstrating faster ORR kinetics was achieved on Co<sub>40</sub>SAs/AC@ NG. The Tafel slope of the Co<sub>40</sub>SAs/AC@NG was calculated to be 90 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>, which is a litter higher than that of Pt/C (83 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>, Figure 4c). Moreover, the mass activity of Co40SAs/AC@NG at 0.85 V was calculated to be 305 A g<sup>-1</sup>, which is  $\approx 5$  times higher than that of Pt/C (60.5 A g<sup>-1</sup>) at a potential of 0.85 V and comparable to the previously reported single atom ORR catalysts (Table S3, Supporting Information). The Koutecky-Levich (K-L) plots of Co40SAs/AC@NG derived from rotating disk electrode (RDE) measurements show excellent linearity, presenting the first-order kinetics of electrocatalytic reaction. Based on the K-L equation, the electron transfer number (n) of Co<sub>40</sub>SAs/AC@NG is determined to be 3.85-3.99 in a wide potential range from 0.3 to 0.7 V

(Figure 4d,e), manifesting a favorable four-electron transfer pathway toward catalyzing ORR. From the rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE) test results, the electron transfer number of  $\text{Co}_{40}\text{SAs/AC@NG}$  is about 3.91–3.95 with a pretty low peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) yield of 2.6%–4.3% at 0.2–0.8 V, which is close to that of Pt/C (n=3.96-3.98,  $\text{H}_2\text{O}_2\%=1.1\text{-}1.8\%$ , Figure 4f). These results demonstrate that a favorable ORR kinetic as well as high selectivity for the 4-electron oxygen reduction reaction pathway can be obtained by the  $\text{Co}_{40}\text{SAs/AC@NG}$  catalyst.

Apart from the superior activity, the methanol crossover effects are of importance for practical application. As presented in Figure S18 (Supporting Information), the Co<sub>40</sub>SAs/AC@NG exhibits a stable current density after injecting 1.0 M methanol into the electrolyte, whereas the Pt/C displays a sharp jump of current density ascribed to the occurrence of methanol oxidation, demonstrating the remarkable methanol tolerance of the Co<sub>40</sub>SAs/AC@NG. Moreover, durability is another significant factor toward practical application, which is usually evaluated by the accelerated durability test (ADT) and chronoamperometric (CA) test. As displayed in Figure 4g, negligible decay in terms of half-wave potential and small current attenuation is observed after 5000 continuous CV cycles. Furthermore, the Co<sub>40</sub>SAs/AC@NG retains up to 94.5% of the initial current density after 25 h continuously operation, whereas only 78.4% retention can be found on the Pt/C, suggesting the good durability of Co40SAs/AC@NG (Figure 4h). After longterm durability tests, a series of characterizations of the used Co40SAs/AC@NG catalyst were performed (Figures S19-S21, Supporting Information). XRD pattern reveals that there are no peaks from metallic Co species. SEM and TEM images display that the wrinkle nanosheets with rich pores could be well remained, and no Co nanoparticle are detected, demonstrating its outstanding structural robustness. The EDX mapping images imply the uniform distributions of C, N, and Co elements throughout the entire architecture. In addition, the high-resolution Co 2p and N 1s XPS spectra shows that both the Co and N species still possess initial states. The outstanding ORR performance of Co<sub>40</sub>SAs/AC@NG stems from the following several factors. First, the high loading efficient Co single atoms and clusters can simultaneously improve ORR activity; Secondly, the high N contents, especially the high-level pyridinic N, endows a higher positive charge density on neighboring C atoms and facilitates O2 adsorption, and thus favors the ORR process. [65] Moreover, the ultrathin carbon structure with abundant pores ensures its electrical conductivity for fast electron/mass transport and provides sufficient exposed active sites for ORR.

#### 2.4. Density Functional Theory (DFT) Calculations

DFT calculations were carried out to understand the role of Co single atoms and clusters in Co SAs/AC@NG catalysts. The computational hydrogen electrode (CHE) method proposed by Norskov et al<sup>[78]</sup> is employed to obtain the free energy diagram of ORR on both Co SAs/AC and Co SAs. The Co AC structure was prepared through an annealing simulation detailed in Supporting Information. As a comparison, we also employ the FED of Pt/C calculated by Greeley et al.<sup>[79]</sup> plotted by black stepwise

curves in Figure 5a. About the structures in this work, we should consider for Co SAs/AC@NG, the possible active sites can be Co SAs and Co AC, as well as the mixed sites that are composed both of them. Based on this, we here discuss three most probable mixed sites, namely, Co SAs with an underlying Co AC (Co SAs/AC), Co AC with underlying nitrogen doped carbon (Co AC/NC) and Co AC with underlying Co SAs (Co AC/SAs). The structures of these three sites are plotted in Figure 5b. Their FEDs are given in Figure 5a, and we can see pure Co SAs sites shows better activity than Pt/C, consistent with the experimental results.

However, when doping with Co AC/NC, Co SAs activity decreases by showing smaller affinities to OOH\* and O\*. This seems to indicate Co SAs/AC is not the only active site for Co SAs/AC@NG. On the other hand, another active sites of Co SAs/AC@NG, the Co AC/NC sites in Co SAs/AC@NG shows better activity than pure Co AC and Co AC/SAs. It is the underlying NC that makes Co AC more active. To better understand this, we bring in a charge difference analysis, which is plotted in Figure 5c. From it, one can see hybrid with NC can increase the charge density around the Co-adsorbates bonds. As a consequence of that, Hartree potential in hamitionian will be increased, thus increasing the coupling matrix element (denoted as  $V_{ak}$ ,  $V_{ak} = \langle \varphi_a | H | \varphi_k \rangle$ ) between the adsorbates p orbital and d bands of Co. According to the work proposed by Hammer based on the Newns-Andersen theory, [80,81] when Vak is raised, the adsorption energy is increased. More intrinsically, the reason for the electron density accumulation can be understood through the difference of Fermi level between Co AC and NC. As indicated in Figure 5d, Fermi level of Co AC is smaller than NC, which will result an electron injection from NC to Co AC, and finally leading to the charge accumulation, stronger adsorption, and better ORR activity. Therefore, in addition to Co SAs sites, Co AC/NC sites also contributes to the high activity of Co<sub>40</sub>SAs/AC@NG.

#### 2.5. Zn-Air Battery Performance

The outstanding catalytic performance of Co<sub>40</sub>SAs/AC@NG in the ORR greatly encouraged us to explore its practical applications. Hence, a home-made Zn-air battery was assembled, in which a Zn plate as the anode, Co40SAs/AC@NG or Pt/C catalyst loaded on the carbon paper as the air cathode, and a 6.0 M KOH/0.2 M Zn(AC)2 mixed solution as the electrolyte (**Figure 6**a). As presented in Figure 6b, the open circuit voltage of Co<sub>40</sub>SAs/AC@NG-based Zn-air battery is as high as 1.5 V, very close to that of Pt/C (1.49 V). The discharge polarization and power density curves were displayed in Figure 6c, the maximum power density of Co<sub>40</sub>SAs/AC@NG-based Zn-air battery is  $221 \text{ mW cm}^{-2}$ , outperforms that of Pt/C (195 mW cm<sup>-2</sup>) and most reported those of the state-of-the-catalysts reported Zn-air batteries (Figure 6d; Table S4, Supporting Information).[82-84] Figure 5e displays the galvanostatic discharge curves of Znair battery with Co<sub>40</sub>SAs/AC@NG and Pt/C, the discharge plateau decreased slowly with the current density from 2 to 20 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. At the discharge current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, the battery with Co40SAs/AC@NG presents voltage plateaus of ≈1.29 V, which is higher than that of Pt/C catalyst (1.26 V).

[<sup>1</sup> ]. The study electrode potential is set at *U* = 0.9 V versus RHE; b) The optimized structures of ORR intermediates; c) The result of the charge density difference caused by the NC at the reaction site. The OH is the adsorbates. The value of charge density difference is calculated by the Δ*ρ* = *ρ*[Co AC/NC]- *ρ*[Co AC], with *ρ*[Co AC/NC], and *ρ*[Co], respectively, referring to charge density of Co AC with and without the hybridization of NC. The accumulation and reduction of the charge are colored by red and green; d) The Fermi energy of Co AC and NC.

Moreover, the discharge resumes reversibly when the current density reduces to 2 mA cm−<sup>2</sup> , suggesting remarkable discharge rate performance and good reversibility of Co40SAs/AC@NGbased Zn–air battery.

Furthermore, no obvious voltage drop is observed after discharge for ≈40 h at a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2 (Figure 6f), implying a superb durability of the Co40SAs/AC@NG-based Zn–air battery. The cycling stability was estimated by continuous galvanostatic discharge and charge at 10 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2 for 400 cycles (10 min per cycle). Impressively, the Zn–air battery incorporated with Co40SAs/AC@NG presents a lower voltage gap than Pt/C, indicating the better cycling performance of Co40SAs/AC@NG Zn–air battery (Figure 6g). Profiting from high power density, two series-connected Co40SAs/AC@NG Zn–air batter can power various color light-emitting diode (LED) or miniature windmill (Figure 6h; Figure S22, Supporting Information). Therefore, the high loading Co active sites, high N species, and abundant pore structure endows Co40SAs/AC@NG a promising electrocatalyst to realize highpower and long-life Zn–air batteries.

# **3. Conclusion**

In summary, we have successfully developed a facile self-sacrificing template strategy to construct high loading (14.0 wt.%) single Co atoms and fewer Co clusters embedded in porous nitrogen doped graphene. DFT calculations reveal that both the Co single atoms and Co clusters acted as the active sits for boosting the ORR performance. Benefiting from the high-density Co active sites, ultrahigh N contents dominated by pyridinic N, and porous-rich structure, the optimized Co40SAs/AC@NG catalyst demonstrated remarkable ORR performance in alkaline medium, featured by a high half-wave potential of 0.890 V, which is significantly better than that of Pt/C catalyst. In addition, the Zn–air battery assembled with Co40SAs/AC@NG

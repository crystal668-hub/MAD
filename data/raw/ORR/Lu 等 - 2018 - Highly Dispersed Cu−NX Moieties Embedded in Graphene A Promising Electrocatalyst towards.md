**Abstract**: Transition metal-carbon-nitrogen catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is promising and challenging. Cu is a potential transition metal to form efficient ORR catalysts for fuel cell. Herein, a facile method is developed to synthesize highly dispersed Cu-N<sup>X</sup> and N doped graphene (Cu-N-G) catalyst. The Cu-N-G catalyst shows a half-wave potential (*E*1/2) of 0.859 V, comparable to the commercial Pt/C catalyst (0.856 V), which is among the best compared with the previously reported Cu-based materials. In addition, such a catalyst shows good stability and methanol tolerance in alkaline media. A synergy of doped N (pyridinic and graphitic N) and Cu-N<sup>X</sup> moieties as well as pore structure is revealed to account for the enhanced ORR activity.

# **1. Introduction**

Polymer electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCs) have been emerging as the next generation energy conversion device in terms of their high energy density and environmental friendliness. The sluggish kinetics and harsh operations of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at cathodes require more active and stable electrocatalysts.[1,2] However, the widely-accepted Pt based ORR catalysts are significantly limited by the scarce resources, high cost, insufficient stability and weak methanol tolerance for particularly direct methanol fuel cells.[\[3\]](#page-12-0) Therefore, it is urgent to develop highly active and stable Pt-free ORR electrocatalysts. [\[4\]](#page-12-1)

Recently, nitrogen-doped carbon materials[5,6] and transition metal (TM)-N-C (TM=Fe, Co, Cu, etc.) materials[7-13] have been explored to replace the Pt based electrocatalysts. In literature, some TM-N-C catalysts have exhibited even superior activity compared with the commercial Pt/C.[3,14] Among the TM-based catalysts investigated in previous reports, Cu-based materials are a kind of cheap and abundant catalyst, which has been widely used in the catalytic industry.[15,16] For oxygen electroreduction, Cu has some promising natures. For example, Cu has the second highest electrical conductivity (less than Ag). [\[17\]](#page-12-2) The theoretical calculations claimed that Cu potentially presented among the best ORR activity as its closer position to Pt around the top of so-called "volcano plot". [\[18\]](#page-12-3) Besides, Cu-based catalysts do not promote the formation of hydroperoxyl and hydroxyl radical species (so-called Fenton reagent), which easily attack the components of PEFCs such as ionomer and membrane,[\[19\]](#page-12-4) leading to enhanced durability during fuel cell operations.

Tremendous investigations regarding Cu-based ORR catalysts were preformed, including CuO/carbons,[\[20\]](#page-12-5) Cu-N-doped carbons, [21-27] copper complexes[28-33] and Cu/carbons.[34,35] For example, Wang et.al reported a copper complexes sandwiched between polyvinylimidazole layers wrapped on carbon nanotubes catalyst[\[30\]](#page-12-6) and TiO2-grafted copper complexes deposited on multiwalled carbon nanotubes (CNTs), [\[31\]](#page-12-7) which exhibit a ORR activity comparable to Pt/C catalyst in alkaline media. However, Cu-based catalysts still have lower ORR activity compared with the Fe-based catalysts as well as the commercial Pt/C catalyst, which limit further developments of Cu-based materials for ORR. Besides, current synthesis of Cu-based materials commonly involving complicated protocols. To this end, a facile and controllable method is desirable for developing well-defined Cu-based ORR electrocatalyst.

Herein, we facilely synthesized Cu, N-doped graphene (Cu-N-G) through one-step pyrolysis. Such a Cu-N-G catalyst presents not only good ORR activity with the half-wave potential of 0.859 mV, among the best compared with the state-of-the-art Cu-based catalysts and Pt/C catalysts, but also great long-term stability and methanol tolerance. It is revealed that the synergistic effects of abundant pyridinic and graphitic N, highly dispersed Cu-N<sup>X</sup> moieties, as well as the mesoporous structure are primary contributor to the remarkably improved ORR activity. This work shed a light on a promising direction of Pt-free ORR catalyst.

# **2. Results and Discussion**

### **2.1. Preparation and characterizations for the samples**

As illustrated in Scheme 1, the Cu-N-G catalyst was synthesized by pyrolyzing the composite of graphene oxide, urea and copper (II) acetate monohydrate followed by acid leaching. Without Cu precursor during pyrolysis, the referential N-G catalyst was obtained. The systematic discussions for the two samples were also carried out.

Initially, the Cu-N-G catalyst was pyrolyzed at 700°C, 800°C, 900°C and 1000°C to optimize the pyrolysis temperature base on the ORR performance. As shown in Figure S1, the ORR performance in terms of the half-wave potential is improved as pyrolysis temperature increasing. However, once the pyrolysis temperature is higher than 900°C, the ORR activity inversely decreases, indicating the optimum pyrolysis temperature is 900°C.

**Figure 1**. Morphology and structure of Cu-N-G catalyst. (a) SEM image; (b) TEM image; (c) HRTEM image and (d) HAADF-STEM image and the corresponding element mappings for the Cu, N and C atoms.

The morphology of the prepared samples was presented in Figure 1. The Cu-N-G catalyst after acid leaching shows typical graphene structure, interestingly, without Cu nanoparticles (Figure 1a and 1b), in contrast with the samples before acid leaching (Figure S2). High-resolution TEM (HRTEM) shows the lattice spacing of 0.34 nm (Figure 1c), which is assigned to graphite (002) plane, confirming graphitized graphene sheets. More importantly, HAADF-STEM and elemental mapping in a 2×2 μm region demonstrate the uniform signals of Cu, N and C. The absence of Cu nanoparticles and presence of Cu and N elements in the view simultaneously suggest that Cu along with N is successfully embedded in the graphene, which likely form the Cu-N-C configurations.[\[21\]\[23\]](#page-12-8)

**Figure 2**. (a) XRD patterns of GO, rGO, N-G and Cu-N-G; (b) Raman spectra of N-G and Cu-N-G.

Further physical characterizations are performed to understand the composition and structure of Cu-N-G catalyst. As shown in the XRD patterns of Figure 2a, compared with an obvious diffraction peak at 10.8°of GO, rGO, N-G and Cu-N-G all show the positively shifted peaks at around 26°and 43°, which can be assigned to graphite (002) and (101), agreeing well with the HRTEM in Figure 1c. This fact illustrates that the precursor, GO, is reduced to graphene *via*  pyrolysis. Besides, no diffraction peaks of Cu in Cu-N-G catalysts indicate the absence of Cu nanoparticles, in consistent to the morphology results. As shown in Figure 2b, the Raman spectra of Cu-N-G and N-G catalysts show the D band at 1328 cm-1 and the G band at 1586 cm-1 , respectively. Moreover, the ratio of *I*D/*I*Greflects the degree of graphitization. The *I*D/*I*<sup>G</sup> ratio of Cu-N-G is 1.04, similar to that (1.03) of N-G, indicating that they have the similar graphitization degree.

The surface chemistry of catalyst are characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). N-G and Cu-N-G (Figure 3a and b) show the XPS spectra of N1s, C1s, and O1s. Particularly, the content of Cu is 0.95 wt% (table S1), agreeing with inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES, 1.32 wt%), while the content of N in N-G and Cu-N-G catalysts reach up to 6.01 atom% and 6.11 atom% (table S1), respectively, comparable with the state-of-the-art Ndoped carbon materials (7.9 atom %).[\[36\]](#page-13-0) The deconvoluted N1s spectra of N-G are assigned to pyridinic N (398.3 ± 0.2 eV), pyrrolic N (399.8 ± 0.2 eV), graphitic N (400.9 ± 0.2 eV), and oxidized N (402 - 406 eV), respectively (Figure 3c). [12,23] On the other hand, those of Cu-N-G (Figure 3d) shows five deconvoluted peaks related to pyridinic N, pyrrolic N, graphitic N, oxidized N, and additional Cu-N (398.9 ± 0.2 eV) signals. [21,27] This fact indicates the existence of Cu-N bonds in Cu-N-G catalyst. The N compositions of N-G and Cu-N-G catalysts are illustrated in table S2. The above observations claim the presence of abundant Cu-N and doped N (primarily pyridinic and graphitic N) in the Cu-N-G catalyst.

The Cu2p spectrum of the Cu-N-G catalyst was shown in Figure S3. The Cu2p signals at 930–938, 952–957, and 938–945 eV were known from the  $Cu2p_{3/2}$ ,  $Cu2p_{1/2}$ , and Cu(II) satellite peaks, respectively. The deconvoluted  $Cu2p_{1/2}$  peak revealed two components at 932.6 eV and 934.6 eV, and the deconvoluted  $Cu2p_{3/2}$  peak revealed at 952.1 eV and 954.4 eV, ascribed to the binding energy of  $Cu^{2+}$  and  $Cu^{+}$  species, respectively.

N-G and Cu-N-G catalysts show typical type-IV isotherms in the N<sub>2</sub> physisorption curves (Figure 4a), owing to the formation of mesopore<sup>[27]</sup> during pyrolysis processes. The pore distributions of both N-G and Cu-N-G catalysts center at 4 nm (Figure 4b). The calculated BET specific surface areas are 308 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup> and 266 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup> for N-G and Cu-N-G, respectively (Table S3). The appropriate mesoporous structures of N-G and Cu-N-G is beneficial for exposing more active sites and promoting the mass transfer for ORR. But for a real fuel cell, when the catalyst is deposited into a Membrane Electrode Assemblies (MEA), the mesopore structure could be problematic due to the capillary condensation of water formed as a product, leading to flooding

problems at the cathode. Therefore, more attention should be paid to the compromise on the morphology of the catalyst, concerning meso and macropores in the further research.[\[28\]](#page-12-10)

# **2.2. Catalytic performances and mechanism of the samples for ORR**

The electrocatalytic activities of the N-G and Cu-N-G catalysts are evaluated in 0.1 M KOH solution (Figure 5). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements demonstrate the capability of N-G and Cu-N-G catalyst to reduce oxygen by comparing CV curves in the presence and absence of oxygen (Figure 5a). Interestingly, Cu-N-G presents more positive cathodic peak at 0.83 V, higher than N-G (0.80 V), indicating better ORR activity of Cu-N-G catalyst. The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves on RDE in O2-saturated 0.1M KOH solution are illustrated in Figure 5b. Cu-N-G catalyst exhibits an onset potential (*E*onset) of 0.979 V and a half-wave potential (*E*1/2) of 0.859 V, much higher than N-G catalyst (0.942 V and 0.830 V, respectively), and comparable with the commercial 20 wt% Pt/C catalyst (1.021 V and 0.856 V, respectively). Such ORR activity of Cu-N-G is among the best compared with preciously reported Cu-based catlaysts (Table S4). Cu-N-G catalyst also presents better ORR activity than N-G in O2-saturated 0.1 M HClO<sup>4</sup> (Figure S4), compared with those of catalysts in acidic media (Table S5). It is noteworthy that the activity of N-G is significantly higher than rGO and Cu-G, and is comparable to the commercial 20 wt% Pt/C, implying the N-doping in graphene is a contributor to ORR activity while individual Cudoping is negligible. These results obviously suggested that the high activity of Cu-N-G could be attributed to a synergy between doped N and abundant Cu-N<sup>x</sup> species. To gain further insights into the reaction kinetics and pathways, the electron transfer number (*n*) of catalysts is calculated based on the above results (Figure 5c and d). The value of n is calculated to be around 3.73 for Cu-N-G, and 3.83 for N-G, implying that the ORR proceed through approximate four-electron route for N-G and Cu-N-G catalyst.

The Tafel slope is considered as an important indicator of kinetics rate for ORR process. As presented in Figure 5e, the Tafel slope is 67.65 mV dec-1 for N-G and 73.59 mV dec-1 for Cu-N-G, which are smaller than that of 20% Pt/C (79.84 mV dec-1 ), indicating that the as-prepared catalyst can promote the ORR kinetic process. The exchange current density of the three catalysts was calculated by extrapolation, which is 5.52×10-6 mA cm-2 for N-G, 4.48×10-5 mA cm-2 for Cu-N-G, 1.15×10-4 mA cm-2 for Pt/C, respectively. It is in agreement with the results of the ORR performance in Figure 5b.

Rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) techniques were performed to evaluate the the yield of H2O<sup>2</sup> and electron transfer number of Cu-N-G catalyst and 20 wt% Pt/C. As shown in Figure 5f, Cu-N-G catalyst follows a near four electron ORR route in practice (3.88-4.0) with a lower H2O<sup>2</sup> yield compared with Pt/C catalyst. The number of electron transfer was very closed to Pt/C (4.0, theoretical value), which is consistent with the results of Figure 5d.

From the above discussions, we believe that the high-efficient ORR performance of N-G and Cu-N-G catalysts is mainly attributed to three reasons. Firstly, it is accepted that pyridinic N and graphitic N are beneficial for ORR activity. [37,38] O<sup>2</sup> molecules can easily adsorb on the carbon atoms next to pyridinic N, implying these carbon atoms are key factor to build the active sites for ORR. [\[39\]](#page-13-1) Therefore, the higher content of doped N in this Cu-N-G catalyst is beneficial for ORR activity. Secondly, N-G and Cu-N-G catalysts have appropriate surface area and mesoporous structure, leading to more exposed ORR active sites and improved mass transfer.[\[23\]](#page-12-11) Thus the N-G and Cu-N-G catlaysts present high electrochemical activity. Thirdly, the highly dispersed Cu-N<sup>x</sup> coordinate mioeties within graphene further enhance the ORR activity. The synergy of these aspects facilitates ORR kinetics on Cu-N-G catalyst.

# **2.3. Evaluation of the stability and methanol tolerance for the samples**

**Figure 6**. (a) ORR polarization curves of Cu-N-Gafter 0, 1000 and 5000 potential cycles. (b) Current-time (*it*) chronoamperometric response of N-G, Cu-N-G, and 20 wt% Pt/C electrodes by adding 6.78 mL methanol into the 50 mL solution after about 200 s in O2-saturated 0.1 MKOH at a rotating rate of 1600 rpm.

In addition to activity, the stability of catalysts is pivotal for ORR processes due to the oxygenrich and high-potential environments. The accelerated durability test (ADT) of the Cu-N-G catalyst and the commercial 20% Pt/C were carried out by performing CV between 0.4 and 1.0 V at 50 mV s -1 for 5000 cycles at 1600 rpm in O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH solution.[\[40\]](#page-13-2) A series of LSV curves were performed at the beginning, after 1000 cycles, and at the end of the test, respectively. The ADT of the Cu-N-G catalyst and the commercial 20% Pt/C were shown in Figure 6a and Figure

S5, respectively. The *E*1/2 of Cu-N-G catalyst showed a decrease of only 10 mV after 1000 cycles and 16 mV after 5000 cycles. By contrast, the Pt/C catalyst decayed 20 mV after 1000 cycles and 33 mV after 5000 cycles, indicating that the Cu-N-G catalyst exhibits higher stability as the ORR catalyst. On the other hand, for direct methanol fuel cells, the methanol at anodes easily cross-over through polymer membrane and cause cathode fading. In this regard, methanol tolerance is important for ORR catalysts. After injecting methanol into the electrolytes at the 200th second, ORR current sharply declines on Pt/C catalyst (Figure 6b). Inversely, N-G and Cu-N-G catalysts show no obvious decrease of current densities, confirming excellent methanol tolerance on this Cu-N-G catalyst. This is attributed to the strong covalent bonds among C and N as well as Cu in the carbon matrix that can remit the degradation of Cu-N-G catalysts.

# **3. Conclusions**

In summary, highly dispersed Cu-N<sup>X</sup> mioeties embedded in N doped graphene is synthesized via a simple one-step pyrolysis. The prepared Cu-N-G shows excellent ORR activity compared with the commercial 20 wt% Pt/C in alkaline media, and is among the best compared with other state-of-the-art Cu-based ORR catalysts. The long-term stability and excellent methanol tolerance in alkaline medium of Cu-N-G catalyst are confirmed. A synergy among abundant doped pyridinic and graphitic N, and highly dispersed Cu-N<sup>X</sup> moieties as well as the mesoporous structure is revealed, accounting for the promising performance of the Cu-N-G catalyst. These investigatio n results are conductive to design and synthesize high-efficient Cu-based ORR electrocatalysts by increasing the contents of pyridinic N, graphitic N and Cu-N<sup>x</sup> moieties.

# **Experimental Section**

### **Chemicals**

Graphite flakes (95%) was purchased from Jixi Puchen Graphite Co. Ltd. Sulfuric acid (H2SO4), phosphoric acid (H3PO4), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2, 30%) and potassium permanganate (KMnO4), urea and copper (II) acetate monohydrate were of analytical grade and obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. (China). Potassium hydroxide (KOH, 99.99%) was purchased from Shanghai Aladdin biochemical technology Co. Ltd. All chemicals were used without any further purification.

### **Preparation of graphene oxide (GO)**

GO was synthesized by using a modified Hummers method. [\[41\]](#page-13-3) Briefly, a mixture of concentrated H2SO4/H3PO<sup>4</sup> (180:20 mL) was added to 1.5 g graphite flakes and 9 g KMnO4. The reactor was then heated to 50 °C under further stirring for 6 h. After that, the reactor was cooled down naturally to room temperature followed by pouring the mixture into a mixed solution of ice (100 mL) with 30% H2O2(20 mL). The obtained suspension was centrifuged and washed for several times. Finally, the powders were freeze-dried to get GO samples.

### **Preparation of N-G and Cu-N-G**

GO, urea and copper (II) acetate monohydrate (Cu(OAc)2) with a ratio of GO : urea : Cu(OAc)2= 1:20:0.075 were adequately grounded and mixed for an hour. Subsequently, the mixtures were pyrolyzed at 900℃ for 1 h with a ramp rate of 5 °C min-1 under H2/Ar (5%:95%) atmosphere. After cooling down to room temperature, the sample was leached in 0.5 M sulfuric acid at 80 °C for 8 h. Then the sample was collected by centrifugation and then dried in a vacuum at 65 °C for 24 h. The resultant material was denoted as Cu-N-G. Similarly, referential N-doped graphene (N-G), reduce graphene oxide (rGO) and Cu-doped graphene (Cu-G) were prepared in the same method except selecting different precursors.

# **Physical characterization**

The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) on a Quanta 200FEG and transmission electron microscopy on FEI Titan G2 60-300 (AC-TEM) were used to characterize catalyst morphology. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a Bruker D8 diffractometer by using Cu Kα (1.5406 Å) radiation. Raman spectra was performed on a Raman spectrometer (HR800, JY Company) with 457.9 nm laser. Surface area and pore size distribution of samples were characterized using a 3H-2000PS1 gas adsorption analyzer (Bei Shi De, China) by recording nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed on a Physical Electronics PHI model 5700 instrument with Al Kα radiation (1486.6 eV). The binding energy for all samples was corrected by the C1s binding energy at 284.8 eV. Cu content in the sample was analyzed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) using Agilent 7700 instrument.

### **Electrochemical measurements**

The prepared catalysts were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) on a rotating disk electrode (RDE). A standard three-electrode cell controlled by a CHI760E electrochemical workstation was used containing a working glass carbon RDE, a mercury/mercuric oxide electrode (Hg/HgO) as the reference electrode and a Pt wire electrode as the counter electrode. The Hg/HgO reference electrode can be converted to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) potential by the equation: *E*(RHE)=*E*(Hg/HgO)+0.890 V. The saturated calomel electrode (SCE) was served as reference electrode in 0.1 M HClO4. The SCE reference electrode can be converted to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) potential by equation: *E*(RHE)=*E*(SCE)+0.308 V. A homogeneous ink was prepared by ultrasonically suspending 5 mg of catalyst in a mixture of 400 l isopropyl alcohol, 600 l ultrapure water and 40 μL of Nafion solution (5 wt%, Du Pont). The catalyst loadings on working electrode are 0.306 mg cm<sup>-2</sup> for the as-prepared catalysts and the commercial 20 wt% Pt/C catalyst. The ORR performance of the catalysts was studied by using CV and LSV in the potential range from 0.2 V to 1.2 V (vs. RHE) with a scan rate of 10 mV/s and at 1600 rpm in 0.1M KOH solution. Before measurements, the KOH solution was saturated with pure N<sub>2</sub> or pure O<sub>2</sub> for at least 30 min. All the measurements were performed at room temperature. All current densities were normalized to the geometric area of the RDE (0.196 cm<sup>2</sup>). The electron transfer number (n) was calculated based on the Koutecky-Levich (K-L) equation as follows:

$$\frac{1}{j} = \frac{1}{j_{L}} + \frac{1}{j_{K}} = \frac{1}{B\omega^{1/2}} + \frac{1}{j_{K}}$$

$$B = 0.2nFC_{O_{2}}D_{O_{2}}^{2/3}v^{-1/6}$$

where j is the overall current density,  $j_L$  is the diffusion-limiting current density,  $j_k$  is the kinetic-limiting current, and  $\omega$  is the electrode rotation rate (rmp). F is the Faradaic constant (96485 C mol<sup>-1</sup>),  $C_{O_2}$  is the oxygen concentration (solubility) in 0.1 M KOH (1.2×10<sup>-6</sup> mol cm<sup>-3</sup>),  $D_{O_2}$  is the oxygen diffusion coefficient in 0.1 M KOH (1.90×10<sup>-5</sup> cm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>), v is the kinematic viscosity of 0.1 M KOH (0.01 cm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>) and n is the transferred electron numbers in the ORR.

The rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) tests was used to determine the amount of  $H_2O_2$  produced and electron transfer number in the revised manuscript. The disk electrode was scanned at a rate of 10 mV s<sup>-1</sup> at 1600 rpm, and the ring potential was 1.3 V (vs. RHE) in  $O_2$ -saturated 0.1 M KOH. The yield of Hydrogen peroxide ( $H_2O_2\%$ ) and the electron transfer number (n) were measured in terms of the following equations.

$$H_2O_2(\%) = 200 \frac{I_R / N}{I_D + I_R / N}$$

$$n = 4 \frac{I_D}{I_D + I_R / N}$$

where  $I_D$  and  $I_R$  are the disk and ring current, respectively, and N is the collection efficiency of 0.37.

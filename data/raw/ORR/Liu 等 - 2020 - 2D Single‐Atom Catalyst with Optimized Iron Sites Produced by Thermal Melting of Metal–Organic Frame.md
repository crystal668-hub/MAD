**Zeolitic-imidazolate-frameworks-8 (ZIF-8) derivatives have recently been demonstrated as one of the most ideal precursors to prepare single-atom metal catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, abundant single-atom metal sites are buried in the derived carbon nanoparticles, rendering them useless for ORR. Here a novel ZIF-8 "thermal melting" strategy is proposed to prepare a high specific surface area of Fe-N-doped graphene nanosheets (Fe-N/GNs) with single-atom Fe-sites on the surface which are accessible to electrolytes, optimizing their utilization and improving ORR activity. As a result, the Fe-N/GNs material exhibits excellent ORR activity with half-wave potentials of 0.903 V in alkaline media and 0.837 V in acidic media, which are comparable to commercial Pt/C catalysts.**

membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), which is a kind of powerful and meritorious energy technologies to overcome the rapid depletion of nonrenewable fossil fuels and air pollution issues.[1–3] Pt supported on carbon blacks are acknowledged as the most effective and commercially available catalysts to accelerate the ORR. However, the high-cost and low-abundance of Pt have significantly hindered the commercialization of PEMFCs. Therefore, great efforts have been devoted to searching for low-cost and earth-abundant materials to substitute Pt-based catalysts for the ORR.[4–9] Among a broad variety of explored nonprecious metal-based cata-

lysts (NPMCs), Fe-N/C materials prepared by high-temperature pyrolysis have considerably attracted great interests in recent years.[10–13] Previous literatures have reported that the ORR active sites of these catalysts consist of single-atom iron cation coordinated by several pyridinic and/or pyrrolic functionalities (Fe-N*x*) attached to the edges of two graphitic sheets or the basal planes of carbon.[14–18] The ORR performance of Fe-N/C is strongly demonstrated by the concentration of Fe-N*x* active sites. However, during the pyrolysis of Fe-containing precursors, Fe atoms are mobile and aggregated into nanosized counterparts, not conductive to formation of atomic Fe-N*<sup>x</sup>* species.[19–21] Accordingly, rational design of Fe-containing precursors at the molecular level to stabilize Fe atoms during the high-temperature treatment plays a key role in the formation of single-atom Fe-N/C catalysts and achieving a satisfactory ORR performance.

Zeolitic-imidazolate-frameworks-8 (ZIF-8), a member of metal–organic framework family, is constructed of tetrahedrally coordinated zinc ions linked by N-group in organic imidazole units and enriched with nanopores.[22–24] By virtue of simple nanoengineering of ion substitution and/or nanopore filling, Fe modified ZIF-8 can be achieved. Such Fe-modified ZIFs are regarded as a kind of ideal precursors to prepare atomically dispersed Fe-N/C catalysts due to their similar structure.[25–28] For example, Xiao et al. conducted some Fe ions into ZIF-8 to substitute Zn, showing a good strategy to synthesize highperformance single-atom Fe catalysts.[29] Li's group proposed a cage-encapsulated-precursor pyrolysis strategy to achieve an isolated single-atom Fe-N-doped porous carbon for the ORR catalyst, where iron source was cage-encapsulated in ZIF-8.[30]

Wang et al. reported a new kind of Fe-N/C based ORR catalyst derived from the precursor of single ferrocene molecules which were trapped within the cavities of ZIF-8.[31] However, the ZIF-8 particles are rhombic dodecahedral and independent to each other, resulting in the derived Fe-N/C materials with physical stacking structure and undesirable charge transfer path. Furthermore, abundant Fe-N*x* active sites may be buried in ZIF-8-derived polyhedral carbon. Even worse, agglomerated Fe/ Fe3C particles were usually observed in ZIF-8-derived Fe-N/C materials. Such above issues can compromise the ORR performance of ZIF-8-derived Fe-N/C materials.

In this report, we propose a novel ZIF-8 "thermal melting" strategy to synthesize 2D porous Fe-N-doped graphene nanosheets (Fe-N/GNs). Fe-modified ZIF-8 was thermally molten on graphene nanosheets and then decomposed to generate thin and active porous carbon layer during hightemperature pyrolysis, which endows Fe-N/GNs with an ultrahigh specific surface area of 1237.9 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> to host single-atom Fe active sites accessible to electrolyte during electrochemical reactions. Aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) image and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) demonstrate that Fe-N/GNs are enriched with atomically dispersed Fe-N*x* active sites. Benefit from high concentration of atomic Fe-N*x* sites hosted on the large specific surface area and highly electrical conductivity of porous graphene. The resultant Fe-N/GNs electrocatalyst displays outstanding ORR catalytic performance in both alkaline and acidic mediums.

## **2. Results and Discussion**

The synthesis of Fe-N/GNs is illustrated in **Figure 1**a. Owing to the strong interactions between the metal ions in Fe modified ZIF-8 "seeds" (s-Fe/ZIF-8) and the oxygen-containing groups in graphene oxide (GO, prepared according to previous work[32]), rhombic dodecahedral nanocrystals uniformly anchored on GO nanosheets were achieved (Figure 1b). Like a hand, the GO nanosheet can firmly grip s-Fe/ZIF-8 nanoparticles (Figure S1, Supporting Information), reducing the crystal growth rate and resulting in much smaller s-Fe/ZIF-8 size (≈50 nm) on GO (s-Fe/ZIF-8/GO) than that of the counterpart (Fe/ZIF-8) in the absence of GO (100 nm) (Figure S2, Supporting Information). Meanwhile, both the s-Fe/ZIF-8 and Fe/ ZIF-8 can provide steric barriers to prevent the aggregation of the graphene nanosheets.[33] After high-temperature pyrolysis

of the s-Fe/ZIF-8/GO precursors, the Fe-N/GNs catalysts were obtained. The pyrolyzed temperature at 900 °C is the best one in this system (Figure S3, Supporting Information) and the following catalysts mentioned were prepared by using this optimization process. A typical transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image (Figure 1c) shows that Fe-N/GNs have a crumpled nanosheet structure while rhombic dodecahedral nanostructure vanishes from sight, which is in good agreement with previous work.[34,35] The "thermal melting" process may be caused by the following two aspects: 1) Small amount of carbon was oxidized by the oxygen atom escaped from s-Fe/ZIF-8. 2) Suffering from the high surface energy, most of the s-Fe/ZIF-8 has to cling to the graphene sheets which possesses large amount of efficient nucleation sites, resulting the ultrathin porous carbon layer along with the GO template uniformly. Different from s-Fe/ZIF-8/GO precursor, a mixture of Fe/ZIF-8 and GO holds a weak interaction between them, making Fe/ZIF-8 difficult to thermally melt on graphene sheets, which result in Fe/ZIF-8 derived granular carbon nanostructure on graphene nanosheet (Figure S4, Supporting Information). To further reveal the thermal melting process, atomic force microscopy characterization was carried out. As shown in Figure S5 in the Supporting Information, the thickness of Fe-N/GNs sheet is about 3 nm, only 1.4 nm thicker than that of pristine GO (1.6 nm), demonstrating the s-Fe/ZIF-8 can be thermal molten and then derived a thin carbon layer on graphene sheet. Figure 1d shows that the Fe-N/GNs present a rough surface, different from that of GO (Figure S6, Supporting Information), mainly due to the porous structure from the carbonization of organic linkers and the evaporation of Zn. Furthermore, no nanosized Fe species was observed, suggesting that Fe can be embedded carbon matrix as an atomically dispersed form.[36] Based on the above results, we believe that during the heat-treatment, high surface energy of s-Fe/ZIF-8 on GO was suffered from first fusion and reorganization, leading to a thin s-Fe/ZIF-8 layer on GO and then converting to an ultrathin porous carbon layer covered on the graphene nanosheet. During the high-temperature pyrolysis process, Zn atoms in ZIF-8 can confine and isolate Fe atoms. Furthermore, Zn is easily evaporated due to short diffusion distance toward ZIF-derived carbon interfaces. Such s-Fe/ZIF-8 layer anchored on GO was therefore directly converted to exposed single-atom Fe-N*x* active sites due to the interaction between s-Fe/ZIF-8 and GO.

A typical high-resolution TEM image (Figure S7, Supporting Information) exhibits that abundant distorted graphitic layers were anchored on few-layer graphene sheet. Such feature endows it with high surface area to host active sites accessible to electrolyte and good electrical conductivity to improve electron transfer of Fe-N/GNs, which play a vital role in the ORR. Figure 1e shows an STEM image of Fe-N/GNs. Combining with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis, we achieved the elemental composition and distribution in Fe-N/ GNs. As shown in Figure 1f and Figure S8 in the Supporting Information, the uniformly distributed C, N, O, and Fe signals were detected, which suggests that the Fe and N were successfully doped in Fe-N/GNs. Notably, no Zn signal was detected in the Fe-N/GNs. The thin ZIF-8 on graphene sheet derived from its fusion would reduce the diffusion distance of zinc atoms to reach the surface, facilitating their evaporating at high temperatures. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were conducted to characterize the crystal structures (Figure S9, Supporting Information). Two distinct characteristic peaks (2θ = 26° and 44°) were ascribed to the (002) and (101) planes of graphitic carbon while no Fe species was detected.[37,38] We further employed the high-angle annular dark-field STEM (HAADF-STEM) to investigate the Fe configurations in Fe-N/GNs at the atomic level. As shown in Figure 1g, large amounts of bright dots marked by red circles represent isolated iron atoms in Fe-N/GNs. Such abundant Fe atoms coordinated with N atoms (Fe-N*x*) on the surface of Fe-N/GNs can endow it with high-performance ORR activity.

To further investigate the Fe configurations in Fe-N/GNs, we performed the K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and EXAFS spectra. As shown in **Figure 2**a, the energy absorption threshold of Fe-N/GNs locates between standard FeO and Fe2O3, indicating that the oxidation state of Fe in Fe-N/ GNs is between 2+ and 3+. Compared to the reference sample of Fe foil, the EXAFS spectrum of Fe-N/GNs in Figure 2b presents no obvious scattering peak at the position of Fe-Fe coordination (2.1 Å), in agreement with the above HAADF-STEM result that the Fe species are atomically dispersed without any aggregation. Furthermore, the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) characterization was conducted to reveal the chemical composition of Fe-N/GNs (Figure S10 and Table S1, Supporting Information). There is no Zn atom detected in Fe-N/ GNs, in good agreement with the EDS elemental mapping result. By contrast, Zn signal was observed in the reference sample of FeNC/RGO (0.42 at.%) derived from the mixture of Fe-doped ZIF-8 and GO possibly due to relatively hard evaporation from ZIF-8 nanoparticles. Furthermore, Fe-N/GNs possess much higher dopant content of Fe (0.47 at%) than that of FeNC/RGO (0.21 at%). The Fe atoms in Fe-N/GNs are on the surface, which is easy to be detected by XPS technique. The Fe content of Fe-N/GNs was further demonstrated to be 2.04 wt% from inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, consistent with XPS (2.16 wt%). Figure 2c shows the high-resolution N 1s spectra of Fe-N/GNs and FeNC/RGO, which are deconvoluted into four peaks with binding energies of 398.7 (pyridinic N), 400.0 (pyrrolic N), 401.3 (graphitic N), and 402.3 eV (oxidized N), respectively.[39,40] The relative concentrations of N species are also presented in Figure 2d. According to previous studies, pyridinic N and pyrrolic N are coordinated ones with Fe atoms to construct catalytically active Fe−N*x* sites for the ORR.[41,42] Fe-N/GNs have obviously higher pyridinic N (51.9%) and pyrrolic N (22.7%) than those of FeNC/RGO (32.7% pyridinic N and 17.4% pyrrolic N). Accordingly, more single-atom Fe active sites were hosted on the surface of Fe-N/GNs, which is good for the ORR. Figure 2e shows the Fe 2p spectrum of Fe-N/ GNs. Five peaks of 710.5, 713.1, 718.7, 723.6, and 725 eV are assigned to Fe2<sup>+</sup> 2p2/3, Fe3<sup>+</sup> 2p2/3, satellite peak, Fe2<sup>+</sup> 2p1/2, and Fe2<sup>+</sup> 2p1/2 on the basis of binding energies, respectively.[43] The coexistent ferrous and ferric Fe-N*x* in Fe-N/GNs further prove the XANES conclusion. The surface area is another significant factor to influence the ORR activity. N2 adsorption/desorption isotherm measurements were performed. As shown in Figure S11 in the Supporting Information, the Brunauer–Emmett– Teller surface area of Fe-N/GNs is 1237.9 m2 g−<sup>1</sup> , significantly higher than that of FeNC/RGO (790.0 m2 g−<sup>1</sup> ). Such high surface area comes from abundant micropores (inset of Figure S11,

**Figure 2.** a) Fe K-edge XANES spectra of Fe foil, FeO, Fe2O3, and Fe-N/GNs. b) Fourier-transform EXAFS spectra of Fe foil and Fe-N/GNs. c) N 1s curves of Fe-N/GNs and FeNC/RGO. d) The content of different types of nitrogen in the Fe-N/GNs and FeNC/RGO. e) Fe 2p curve of Fe-N/GNs.

Supporting Information), where atomically isolated Fe-N*x* active sites are hosted. Fe-N/GNs have a large surface area to support numerous catalytic centers for O2 chemisorption and reduction, which is excepted as a good ORR catalyst.[44]

The electrocatalytic activity for the ORR was evaluated using rotating disk electrode (RDE) and rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) techniques in alkaline (0.1 <sup>m</sup> KOH) and acidic (0.1 <sup>m</sup> HClO4) solutions. As shown in **Figure 3**a, FeNC/RGO holds a good ORR activity with a large positive half-wave potential (*E*1/2) of 0.88 V in alkaline media, which is comparable to most of decently reports.[45–47] Compared to FeNC/RGO, the Fe-N/ GNs show a better ORR activity, the *E*1/2 holds positive shift to 0.903 V, which is even better than that of the commercial Pt/C (0.895 V). The polarization curves performed in acidic electrolyte are displayed in Figure 3b. Fe-N/GNs also show an excellent ORR activity with a *E*1/2 of 0.837 V, almost the same as that of Pt/C (0.840 V) and more positive than that of FeNC/ RGO (0.752 V). In alkaline electrolyte, N-doped carbon, in especial pyridinic N, and atomically isolated Fe-N*x* are very active for the ORR. However, N-doped carbon sites in acidic media are not very active. Control experiment was performed to demonstrate the above. N-doped graphene nanosheets (N/GNs) prepared without Fe source holds a good ORR activity even comparable to Fe-containing FeNC/RGO in alkaline media (Figure 3a), while obviously inferior activity is shown in acidic media (Figure 3b). Thus, the ORR difference between Fe-N/ GNs and FeNC/RGO in acidic media (*E*1/2: 0.837 V vs 0.752 V) is larger than that in alkaline mediums (*E*1/2: 0.903 V vs 0.88 V). The ORR performance of Fe-N/GNs and FeNC/RGO are also influenced by the nanostructure significantly.[48] Furthermore, Fe-N/GNs have higher concentration of Fe-N*x* active sites access to the electrolyte, resulting in higher ORR activity than that of FeNC/RGO.

The Tafel slopes were derived to evaluate the ORR kinetic character between Fe-N/GNs and Pt/C. As shown in Figure 3c,d, the Fe-N/GNs exhibit smaller Tafel slops than those of the Pt/C in both alkaline and acidic conditions, indicating that the unique structure of Fe-N/GNs catalyst can facilitate mass transfer apparently, and the first electron transfer was probably the ratedetermining step.[49,50] Subsequently, RDE measurements of the Fe-N/GNs were performed under different rotating speed at a scan rate of 10 mV s−<sup>1</sup> . As shown in Figure 3e,f, higher rotation rates lead to higher catalytic current density because of the enhanced diffusion of electrolytes. Koutecky–Levich (K-L) plots (the insets of Figure 3e,f) derived from the ORR polarization curves at various rotation rates in both alkaline and acidic mediums show good linearity (*R*<sup>2</sup> > 0.99) with an approximately constant slope, indicating that the ORR processes follow firstorder kinetics with respect to the dissolved O2 concentration. Furthermore, the average electron transfer number (*n*) is 4.05 in alkaline electrolyte calculated from the K-L plots while that in acidic media is 3.91. Therefore, the ORR on the Fe-N/GNs catalyst in both alkaline and acidic conditions followed a near 4*e*− transfer pathway, demonstrating an efficient reduction of O2.

To further prove the above conclusion, the ORR catalytic behaviors were evaluated by calculating *n* and the yield of peroxide species based on RRDE measurements. As shown in **Figure 4**a, Fe-N/GNs show an average *n* of 3.98 and the HO2 <sup>−</sup> yield is less than 2% in alkaline solution at potential range from 0.2 to 0.8 V, corresponding to a 4*e*− ORR process, in agreement with the K-L plots. In the acidic electrolyte, Fe-N/ GNs still show much high efficiency, such as the H2O2 yield

is lower than 1% at all potentials (Figure 4b). Fe-N/GNs with higher efficiency and lower yield of peroxide species than those of Pt/C in both alkaline and acidic conditions can be attributed to high content of Fe-N*x* active center on the surface access to electrolytes, realizing their fullest utilization. For the sustainable use of electrocatalysts, their long-term durability is essential for PEMFCs. To investigate the stability of Fe-N/GNs and Pt/C catalyst in both alkaline and acidic solutions, the samples were continuously evaluated by the chronoamperometric measurements with a rotation rate of 1600 rpm. As shown in Figure 4c,d, compared to Pt/C, Fe-N/GNs exhibit obviously low current decay in both alkaline and acidic electrolytes, indicating its better ORR stability. Furthermore, after chronoamperometric measurements, RDE tests were performed (Figure S12, Supporting Information). Fe-N/GNs have a small *E*1/2 negative shift of 19 mV in alkaline solution while no obvious shift was detected in acidic medium, further suggesting Fe-N/GNs hold a good stability. Besides the high ORR activity and stability of Fe-N/GNs catalyst, the possible fuel crossover effect is another potential threat. As shown in Figure S13 in the Supporting Information, a significant decrease in the current density of Pt/C is observed when adding methanol, whereas the Fe-N/ GNs are not sensitive to methanol, indicating that the Fe-N/ GNs catalyst has strong tolerance to methanol crossover effect.

Based on the structural and compositional characterization results, we believe that the excellent ORR performance of Fe-N/ GNs in both alkaline and acidic solution mainly attributes to the s-Fe/ZIF-8 "thermal melting" process during thermal treatment, leading to an ultrathin porous carbon layer on graphene nanosheets. The unique 2D structure can expose the singleatom Fe active sites to electrolytes and realize their fullest utilization, resulting in high ORR activity. More than that, the well-graphitization structure ensures its electrical conductivity for electron transfer while the high specific surface area (1237.9 m<sup>2</sup> g−<sup>1</sup> ) offers abundant space to host large numbers of atomically isolated Fe active sites.

#### **3. Conclusion**

In summary, we presented a direct ZIF-8 thermal melting strategy to synthesize 2D structured single iron atoms anchored on porous graphene nanosheets. The s-Fe/ZIF-8 was tightly embed in GO. During the high-temperature treatment, it suffered from thermal melting on the graphene sheets and then pyrolysis, resulting in porous ultrathin carbon layer on graphene sheets. More importantly, abundant Fe-N*x* active sites were anchored in the ultrathin carbon layer, making the singleatom Fe active sites on the surface and realizing their fullest utilization. As a result, the as-prepared Fe-N/GNs exhibited efficient and stable ORR performances in both alkaline and acidic mediums, showing great potential to replace commercial Pt/C catalyst. This work develops a significant strategy to synthesize single-atom Fe catalysts, which can solve the dilemma about Fe-N-C catalysts accompanied with buried single-Fe-atom sites and nanosized Fe species showing undesirable ORR activity as well as extend to other single-atom catalysts and applications.

#### **4. Experimental Section**

*Synthesis of Fe-N/GNs and FeNC/RGO*: Graphene oxide was prepared by a modified Hummer's method as reported. Typically, 0.91 g Zn(NO3)2 • 6H2O and 15 mg of Fe(NO)3 • 9H2O were dissolved into 60 mL methanol to form solution A. 2-Methylimidazole was dissolved into 40 mL of methanol to form solution B. 80 mL 1 mg mL−<sup>1</sup> graphene oxide methanol solution was denoted as solution C. The s-Fe/ZIF-8 was achieved by mixing A and B with stirring for 30 min. Then solution C was added into the mixture above. After stirring for 8 h, the s-Fe/ZIF-8/ GO was collected by centrifugation, washed with deionized water and ethanol, and subsequently freeze-dried. The prepared s-Fe/ZIF-8/GO was pyrolyzed under N2 flow for 30 min and then switching to NH3 flow for 30 min at 900 °C. Finally, the collected powder was suffered from acidic etching of 0.5 <sup>m</sup> H2SO4 at 80 °C for 6 h to achieve Fe-N/GNs.

For comparison, solutions A and B were mixed first to stir for 24 h to prepare Fe-doped ZIF-8. Then the Fe/ZIF-8/GO was obtained by stirring the mixture of Fe-doped ZIF-8 and solution C for 8 h. FeNC/RGO was prepared by pyrolyzing Fe/ZIF-8/GO under the same process.

Identifying high-performance non-precious metal-based catalysts at the cathode is a major challenge for future practical applications. Herein, a soft-template route through a selfassembly arrangement of sulfur sources was successfully developed, facilitating the anion exchange. In addition, compared with pristine cobalt disulfide synthesized without templates, the cobalt disulfide prepared using the new method presented a lattice shrinking phenomenon due to the hindrance of cobalt hydroxide crystal cell. Based on X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculation, increased occupancy of e<sub>a</sub> orbitals was verified for the

cobalt disulfide after shrinkage, which was the main factor for enhancing the intrinsic activity of the catalyst. Besides the microscopic morphologic structure, elementary composition, and the valence state of the elements, the possible growth process of the cobalt disulfide was also discussed in detail. As catalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction, CoS<sub>2</sub> showed a similar half-wave potential (0.81 vs. 0.84 V for Pt/C) and higher diffusion-limiting current density (reaching 5.19 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> for Pt/C) than a commercial Pt/C catalyst. Hence, our results provide a rational design direction for this type of catalysts.

#### Introduction

Fuel cell urgently needs to be developed as a new energy technology to reduce energy consumption and pollution.[1] However, experience and rare precious Pt-based catalysts as the state-of-the-art oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), toughen the approaching commercialization of fuel cells. Hence transition metal oxides and chalcogenides with inexpensive, abundant, and ecO-friendly advantages, have been considered as one of the best alternatives.[2]

In contrast to metal oxides, metal chalcogenides are a more appealing option because the S3p orbitals are more negative than O2p orbitals when they compose conduction bands of catalysts together with d-orbitals of metal cations, which

indicates that metal chalcogenides can exhibit relatively high conductivity by a shallow band gap. [1,3] According to recent research, [4] cobalt sulfides as one kind of promising ORR catalysts have been investigated and applied extensively, such as  $Co_9S_8$ , CoS,  $Co_3S_4$ ,  $CoS_2$  and  $Co_{1-x}S$ . As of now, there have many reports about improving the catalytic activity of cobalt sulfides. Typically, Higgins et al. [5] prepared octahedra CoS<sub>2</sub> in conjunction with different carbon support prepared excellent ORR activity by reinforcing the metal-supports interaction. Incorporating these carbon materials played an essential role in achieving well-defined octahedra CoS2 that exposing highly active {111} facets for ORR. In addition, Singh et al. [6] also reported the detailed synthesis conditions of octahedra CoS<sub>2</sub> for regulating facets. Therefore, octahedra CoS<sub>2</sub> tended to have highly reactive surfaces for ORR.

Unlike the shaped-control affecting exposed crystal-planes on the surface of catalysts, the lattice distortion exhibited a direct effect on lattice parameters and thus changed the intrinsic activity of catalysts. In our previous works, [7] a cation doping strategy to synthesize Cu doping IrO<sub>2</sub> and further affects e<sub>a</sub> orbitals occupation of Ir5d electrons. An et al. [8] reported nanocrystals with subtle lattice distortion in interfaces, and similarly, the distortion had varying degrees of effects on the e<sub>a</sub> orbitals occupation of Ni and Cu3d electrons. Therefore, the lattice distortion was a powerful means to regulate the occupation of e<sub>a</sub> orbitals that provided a primary descriptor for OER/ORR activity. According to ShaO-Horn and co-workers. [9] e<sub>a</sub> orbitals involved the bonding of oxygenated intermediates on metal ions sites, and was considered as a near-unity occupancy corresponding to highest intrinsic OER/ORR activity, which was usually applied in octahedral crystal field of transition-metal oxides or sulfides. The first shell of the CoS<sub>2</sub> crystal cell was one

cobalt ion coordinated with six sulfur anions to form a slightly distorted octahedron. Therefore the CoS2 was suitable for traditional crystal field theory.[10]

Herein we developed a simple hydroxide soft template as the precursor for cobalt disulfide synthesis with outstanding oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity. The much mesoporous on soft template made for a self-assembled arrangement of sulfur sources, which facilitated the process of anion exchange and further improved the crystallinity of cobalt disulfide. Besides, the cobalt disulfide, formed from the cobalt hydroxide crystal cell, was also hampered by the crystal cell of cobalt hydroxide with smaller lattice parameters than cobalt disulfide. So, it presented a lattice shrinking phenomenon compared to the pristine cobalt disulfide without templates and further affected the occupancy of eg orbitals of Co3d electrons. The changed electronic structure was accurately determined by X-ray diffractometry analysis (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). In addition, density functional theory (DFT) calculation was also used to simulate cobalt disulfide with a lattice shrinking for investigating the occupancy of eg orbitals. Therefore, our systematic study about the effect of lattice shrinking on activity can be applied in other such catalysts designing the field for increasing catalyst intrinsic activity.

## **Results and Discussion**

The crystalline structure of as-prepared catalysts was determined by XRD, showed in Figure 1a. It was observed that the O CoS2 synthesized with soft-template and pristine CoS2could be easily indexed to the CoS2 phase (PDF 41–1471). However, the prominent diffraction peaks of O CoS2 synthesized with soft-template were more explicit and exhibited higher crystal-

linity (45.33%) by calculation, in comparison to pristine CoS2 (28.55%). The calculation process of crystallinity was achieved by the function of "Profile fitting" in the Jade 9 software. Hence the using soft template was conducive to the formation of CoS2 NPs. Notably, all diffraction peaks of O CoS2 had a different degree of offset towards the high-angle direction, showed in insert a1. Moreover, given the phenomenon that the higher the angle of the diffraction peak, the greater the peak shift, a reasonable inference that O CoS2 had a lattice shrinking in comparison to pristine CoS2.

The Raman spectroscopy was also performed for the crystal structure of samples. As shown in Figure 1b, five phonon modes were clearly assigned in Raman spectra of O CoS2, [11] while the pristine CoS2 with lower crystallinity presented relatively low peak intensity and sharpness. In the crystal structure of CoS2, a covalent bond existed between the two nearest sulfur atoms, which can be reflected by the Eg mode, that is, a pure librational vibration for dumbbells. The most salient characteristic peaks located at about 387 cm <sup>1</sup> corresponded to the Ag mode, that is, in-phase stretching vibrations of sulfur atoms,[12] while the peak partially overlapped with Ag peak was Tg (2) mode that was out-of-phase stretching vibrations. The Tg (1) and Tg (3) modes combined different librational and stretching vibration of sulfur atoms. It is observed that an overall hypsochromic shift for O CoS2 was compared with pristine CoS2, indicating that a shorter bond or higher electron density. Although the shifts of Tg (1) and Tg (3) peaks were not clearly reflected, characteristic peaks of Eg, Ag, and Tg (3) covered almost all librational and stretching vibration of sulfur atoms,[10] which was clearly illustrated in the insert. Therefore, the results of Raman were consistent with that of XRD.

Further information gained from Fourier-transformed (FT) k2 -normalized extended X-ray absorption fine structure (Figure 1c), O CoS2 had a lower value of *R* and presented an overall negative offset of shells, versus pristine CoS2. The main scattering paths composed of three Co S shells and a Co Co shell were explicitly illustrated in the insert. As shown in Figure 1c1, all shells presented different shrinking percentages because the outer shells would be affected by the inner one, except for the first Co S1 shell. For investigating the influence of lattice shrinking on coordination number, the peaks of the Co S1 shell corresponding to the scattering paths of cobalt cation to six nearest sulfur anions were fitted by IFEFFIT (Interactive XAFS analysis and FEFF fitting, FEFF is effective cured wave scattering amplitude) calculation, displayed in Figure S1 in the Supporting Information. The results showed that O CoS2 had a higher value (4.176) of N (coordination number) multiplied by S0 <sup>2</sup> (amplitude attenuation factor) than that of pristine CoS2 (4.140). Hence, using a soft template improved crystallinity and resulted cobalt disulfides with shorter Co S bonds and higher coordination numbers.

The morphologies of pristine CoS2 and O CoS2 were observed by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) in Figure 2a and 2b. The nanoparticles of O CoS2 consisted of large-grain with a well-defined structure of polyhedron and granules with irregular structure. And pristine CoS2 with uniform sizes showed irregular ellipsoid structure,

which was consistent with the previous reports.[13] N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms (Figure S2) of pristine CoS2 and O CoS2 clearly identified the pristine CoS2 (27.04 m2g <sup>1</sup> ) with the smaller nanoparticles had a higher specific surface area than O CoS2 (16.05 m2g <sup>1</sup> ). To identify the differences of each particle, the regional energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) was performed in representative particles, shown in Figure 2c. The large-grain (spectrum 1) displayed a higher ratio of Co: S in comparison to granules (spectrum 2) and pristine CoS2 (spectrum 3). Increased magnetic Co<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> and decreased anaerobic S helped the adsorption of paramagnetic O2 and the generation of a sulfur vacancy on the surface of CoS2. [14] Remarkably, the granules of O CoS2 and pristine CoS2 had a quite close Co: S ratio that was about 1:2 and electronic structure proved by Raman results (Figure 2d). By contrast with highly crystallized O CoS2 (large-grain) that was discussed in detail above, the characteristic peak of O CoS2 (granules) presented a consistent

peak position (384 cm <sup>1</sup> ) with pristine CoS2, indicating the granules of O CoS2 had no shrinkage of crystal cell. Therefore, it can be considered that the changes in the electronic structure and electrochemical performances were mainly due to the large-grain of O CoS2. Moreover, the regional energy dispersive spectroscopy (Figure 2c), also demonstrated that the NPs of O CoS2 had a higher amount of carbon than pristine CoS2, which can be ascribed to the porous structure of Co-precursor that would be discussed in the following sections.

The difference in morphologies of as-prepared catalysts is further amplified in TEM images. As shown in Figures 2e and f, a clear hexagon is observed on this polyhedron of O CoS2 in comparison to irregular pristine CoS2 NPs. Meanwhile, the phenomenon of lattice shrinking was further bolstered by the lattice spacing derived from the insert of Figure 2e and f. After the Fourier transforms, O CoS2 demonstrated a smaller lattice spacing than pristine CoS2 at the same crystal planes of {210}

and {111}, provided in Figure 2g; that {111} facet is a highly active facet for ORR ofCoS2 has been widely reported.[5,6] So, the change of lattice spacing in {111} facet inevitably affected the ORR activity. Although well-defined O CoS2 was not a regular octahedron, simultaneous exposure of the {111} and {110} facets was an essential characteristic of octahedron-CoS2. What is more, the electron diffraction pattern (Figure S3) further demonstrates the difference in crystallinity of pristine CoS2 and O CoS2. The large-grain of O CoS2 (Figure S3c) had significant single crystal diffraction (Figure S3d), and the apparent amorphous halo can be observed in electron diffraction of pristine CoS2 (Figure S3f) and the granules of O CoS2 (Figure S3b).

#### **Proposed growth process**

Based on experimental evidence, the possible formation process of O CoS2 was illustrated in Figure 3a. Step I was the dissolution of KCl crystal by water, resulting in much mesopore formation on the CO-precursor surface. This phenomenon was consistent with previous reports,[15] and further demonstrated by Brunner-Emmet-Teller (BET) results, shown in Figure S2 (c and d). Besides, the TEM image of Co Co precursor (Figure S4)

also observed a clear chiaroscuro gap and lamellar morphology. These mesoporous played a vital role in the self-assembled arrangement of thiourea (step II) by adsorption, which created a rich sulfur-source environment in favor of anion exchange of S2 <sup>2</sup> and OH . Also, the microtopography change resulted from the dissolution of potassium chloride crystal might be the cause for the formation of large-grain and granules of O CoS2, which also caused the difference in crystallinity that was higher on the areas with more aggregation of thiourea. The XRD pattern of the sample that skipped the step of I during the synthesis process was also provided in Figure S5 and displayed a wide peak structure without any characteristic peaks. Moreover, the lattice shrinking occurred in step III It was observed that the crystal lattices of Co(OH)2 exhibited smaller lattice sizes of *a*= *b*=3.179 Å than that of CoS2 was *a*=*b*=3.909 Å. During the conversion from tetragonal to cubic crystal systems, the growth of CoS2 was suppressed by Co(OH)2 crystal cells. Therefore, the O CoS2 with soft-template presented a lattice shrinking in comparison to pristine CoS2 without soft-template.

As provided in Figure 3b, the Co2p spectra were divided into two main peaks and four minor peaks. The main peaks corresponding to Co2p3/2 and Co2p1/2, respectively, established an energy separation of 15.1 eV,[16] which indicated that the oxidation state of cobalt was Co2<sup>+</sup>. The two minor peaks identified at lower binding energies could be attributed to satellite shake-up peaks,[17] and that at higher binding energies could be the presence of Co NH bonds formed by the decomposition of thiourea.[6,18] The deconvoluted S2p spectra (Figure 3c) show two prominent peaks corresponding to S2p3/2 and S2p1/2, respectively, and three minor peaks.[19] Considering the binding energies of Co2p spectra, the O CoS2 exhibited more severe ion polarization, namely higher binding energies for Co2p peaks and lower binding energies for S2p peaks compared to pure CoS2, due to the shortened Co S bond. The peaks with a binding energy of 161.78 eV (pure CoS2) and 161.65 eV (O CoS2) were assigned to S2 <sup>2</sup> that had not entered the CoS2 lattice and bonded with Co2<sup>+</sup> or CoS2 surface.[20] Besides, the increased S2 <sup>2</sup> peak area for O CoS2 reveals the effective adsorption of CO-precursor. The remaining two peaks at about 165.01 eV and 169.18 eV could be ascribed to the S C bond derived from the decomposition of thiourea and oxidized sulfur species, respectively. Likewise, the composition of C element was discussed in C1 s spectra and C C/C=C peaks used for calibrating to 284.6 eV was main structure of carbon species.[21] Furthermore, C N and slight C O bond was also clearly denoted in Figure 3d. All detailed peak position parameters were provided in Table S1.

On balance, except for the difference in binding energy, the same electronic structure of main elements indicated that O CoS2 and pure CoS2 had the same nanoparticle formation process. Thermogravimetric (TG) analysis carried out in nitrogen from 35 to 800°C was shown in Figure 3e. Compared with the TG curves of pure CoS2, a sharp decline in weight occurred between 530 and 630°C, which was further evidence that the O CoS2 catalyst had more carbon species, according to the previous reports.[22] Obtained from the final weight percentage at 800°C, the treated hydroxide template increased 7.3%

carbon material (contained little nitrogen) for CoS2 catalysts by prophase adsorption. Moreover, the reaction solution after hydrothermal synthesis was also provided in Figure S6. A yellowish solution was observed for pristine CoS2 in comparison to the clear and colorless solution for O CoS2, owing to the dissolution of excessive S or N species.

#### **Electrochemical performance**

To gain insight into the electrochemical performance, asprepared catalysts were assessed by a series of comparative measurements. The CV measurement (Figure 4a) was measured in N2 and O2 saturated 0.1m KOH solution at a scan rate of 50 mV/s. The pristine CoS2 and O CoS2 exhibited an evident oxygen reduction peak in O2-saturated solution by contrast with its CV in the N2-saturated solution, and O CoS2 had a better ORR activity due to higher cathodic peak current density. The ORR polarization plots can also observe the same conclusion through rotating-disk electrode (RDE) measurements in Figure 4b. The O CoS2 provided 40 mV more positive halfwave potential and higher limiting diffusion current density than pristine CoS2. Even in comparison to Pt/C, O CoS2 showed a chose half-wave potential (Δ*E*=42 mV) and better plateau

current density, indicating crystal-cell shrinkage of CoS2 provided a benefit to ORR performance. Detailed comparison results were shown in Table S2.

Furthermore, for analysis of electron-transfer kinetics on oxygen reduction process, a series of rotation rates (Figure S7) from 400 to 1600 rpm were measured in O2-saturated 0.1m KOH solutions, which can provide the current-rotation rate relationship, showed in Figure 4c, with the Koutecky-Levich (K L) equation. Furthermore, all obtained K L plots of asprepared samples displayed good linear relation at 0.65 V, which was further calculated to get the electron transfer number (*n*). The number of O CoS2 is 3.61, which is close to that of commercial Pt/C catalyst (3.98), suggesting its outstanding ORR activity and the ORR for the O CoS2 catalyst undergoes a quasi-four-electron process. Besides, the kinetic current density (*j*k) showed in Figure S8 revealed the O CoS2 had the highest kinetic current density among them. In addition, as a significant parameter for evaluating ORR intrinsic activity, the Tafel slope was presented in Figure 4d. The O CoS2 with a close Tafel slope of Pt/C at low overpotentials manifested efficient electron transport and intrinsic catalytic activity.[23]

As showed in Figure 4e, stability measurements of asprepared catalysts were carried out by chronoamperometry in 0.1m KOH solution at a rotating rate of 1000 rpm. After the 32000 s operation, O CoS2 still retained 83% relative current while pristine CoS2 was 48%, and Pt/C catalyst was 75%, indicating that the polyhedral structure of CoS2 presented after shrinkage was more stable in the ORR process. Furthermore, methanol resistance measurements were shown in Figure S7 (b and d), Pt/C electrode suffered a higher fluctuation in the presence of methanol, and there were almost no effects on performance for O CoS2 catalyst.

Therefore, the O CoS2 catalyst exhibits better methanol tolerance than Pt/C. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was an important indicator for estimating interfacial processes and kinetics of electrode reactions in electrochemical systems, which was performed at each catalyst's half-wave potential ranging from 1 Hz to 10 kHz, showed in Figure 4f. Fitting equivalent circuits (insert) with the ZView software yielded charge-transfer resistance (*R*ct) values of pristine CoS2 (412 Ω)*>*O CoS2 (305 Ω), indicating that O CoS2 possessed a faster electron transport during ORR. Otherwise, abundant carbon species on the surface of O CoS2 also enriched the free electron density, thereby enhancing conductivity. So, O CoS2 had a smaller arc diameter than pristine CoS2.

#### **Changes of crystal-filed configurations states for Co<sup>2</sup>**<sup>+</sup>

More information about the crystal field effect, the spin state, and the oxidation state was determined by Co-K edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES). In Figure 5a, the O CoS2 showed higher oxidation states than pristine CoS2, owing to a shortened Co S bond. In addition, the decreased intensity of the "white line" region reflecting local symmetry and electronic state,[24] was consistent with the shortened Co Co bond lengths mentioned before. The crystal field

(d) Density of states of Co-eg orbitals of CoS2 and CoS2 with a crystal shrinkage (4%), and the changes of configurations states of Co2<sup>+</sup>.

configuration transitions for Co2<sup>+</sup> were presented in the second derivatives of CO-K edge XANES spectra. The negative peak split into one prominent peak and one small peak, corresponding to fully filled t2g6 orbital and eg <sup>1</sup> orbital occupied by a single electron, respectively.[25] Reduced-intensity of t2g peaks and enhanced intensity of eg peaks demonstrated the increased eg occupancy number of the 3d electron, which correlated to surface oxygen bond energy and ultimately affected the intrinsic activities of ORR. In the light of the previous reports,[9a,26] the OER/ORR intrinsic activity can be inferred by the occupancy numbers of eg orbital of transition metal ions, and the optimal occupancy was a near-unity. Therefore, crystalcell shrinkage of CoS2 would lead to an increase in occupancy of eg orbital of Co ion.

To make a stronger case, the calculation about the density of states was shown in Figures 5c and d to investigate the occupancy of the orbital states. The density of states (DOS) of O CoS2 was simulated by applying stress on the original cell, and 4% shrinkage was based on the previous value of *R* (Figure 1c1). Overall, the orbital states of Co3d and S3p after compression presented a stronger hybridization and overlap, in addition, had a consistent shift trend. The *d*-band center as a good descriptor for adsorption capacity of oxygen intermediates,[27] the modest d-band center made for improving ORR kinetics. By calculation, compressed crystal cell emerged a lower d-band center, indicating a higher affinity for O2, which might account for the O CoS2 with higher onset potential. The eg orbital of Co3d, showed in Figure 5d, consisted of the "alpha" orbital crossing the Fermi level and "beta" empty orbital. Apparently, the eg orbital occupied states of contracted crystal cell moved to higher energy levels compared to pristine CoS2. Hence, as illustrated by the schematic diagram of the electronic configuration of Co3d orbital (bottom part of Figure 5d), the spin state of Co2<sup>+</sup> transformed from low spin to high spin brought about increased occupancy numbers of eg orbital,[28] which was consistent with the result of Co-K edge XANES and contributed to the formation of anti-bonding with oxygen molecular orbital in ORR process.

# **Conclusions**

In a nutshell, we successfully synthesized O CoS2 catalysts with a well-defined polyhedron structure by using a polyporous soft template. Compared with the pristine CoS2, the O CoS2 presented a lattice shrinking phenomenon, which was mainly attributed to the use of soft-template. The soft template with abundant mesopore rendered a self-assembled arrangement of sulfur sources and contributed to anion exchange. In the process of anion exchange, the O CoS2 was generated by employing the Co–Co skeleton derived from cobalt hydroxide, and the smaller crystal-cell size of cobalt hydroxide also inhibited the expansion of CoS2 crystal cell. So, this provided a smaller lattice parameters in comparison to the pristine cobalt disulfide without templates. What is more, O CoS2 consisted of large grains with high crystallinity and irregular granules with low crystallinity, which was caused by the difference microtopography of polyporous CO-precursor. The irregular granules possessed the same elementary composition and electronic structure as pristine CoS2. The large grains of O CoS2 presented a higher Co/S ratio and a shrinkage of crystal-cell phenomenon that was considered the main cause of improved ORR activity.

The high-angle offset of peak position in XRD, an overall hypsochromic shift in Raman spectra, decreased *R* value in extended X-ray absorption fine structure, and a reduced lattice spacing of the corresponding facets in TEM together proved the shrinkage of the crystal cell of O–CoS<sub>2</sub>. The second derivatives of Co-K edge XANES spectra and the density of states of Co 3d manifested the increased occupation numbers in e<sub>g</sub> orbitals resulting in transformation of the Co 3d orbitals from low spin to high spin, which was the intrinsic reason for enhanced ORR activity. Consequently, our works provided a new idea for improving the activity of this type of catalyst.

### **Experimental Section**

**Catalyst synthesis**: All chemicals are of analytical grade and were used as received without further purification.

Synthesis of hydroxide soft template: In a typical experiment, 1.2 mmol  $CoCl_2 \cdot 6H_2O$  and 2.4 mmol KOH were each dissolved in 3 mL methanol solution. After completely dissolution, the potassium hydroxide solution was slowly added to the cobalt solution and 0.3 mL deionized (DI) water was added into the above solution under vigorous stirring. The brown products were filtered and washed several times with deionized water until it turned black. The Co-precursor were dried in air at  $70\,^{\circ}C$  overnight for further modification.

**Synthesis of O–CoS**<sub>2</sub>: The as-prepared Co-precursor was dissolved in 25 mL DI water containing 2 mmol thiourea, and then the solution was transferred into a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave. The autoclave was sealed and hydrothermally treated at 200 °C for 12 h. After the reaction was finished, the O–CoS $_2$  was washed several times with ethanol and DI water and then dried at 70 °C for 10 h in a vacuum oven.

Synthesis of pristine  $CoS_2$ : The pristine  $CoS_2$  was prepared by the same procedure without soft template. 1.2 mmol  $CoCl_2 \cdot 6H_2O$  and 2 mmol thiourea were dissolved in 25 mL DI water. Then the solution pH value was adjusted to about 10 using KOH. The solution was transferred into a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave at 200 °C for 12 h.

Electrochemical characterization and electrode preparation: The CHI 650D electrochemical workstation was used to carry out electrochemical measurements. Platinum net and standard calomel electrode as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively, made up a standard three-electrode cell. A series of polarization curves (LSV) and CV measurements were performed in 0.1 mol L $^{-1}$  KOH electrolyte within the potential range of 0.2 and 1.2 V (vs. RHE). The oxygen continued to flow into the electrolyte for ensuring  $\rm O_2$  saturation, apart from the acquisition of background current that needs  $\rm N_2$  saturation. The final spectrum of LSV was obtained by subtracting the background current from the actual current

The electron transfer number (n) per oxygen molecule under different voltage were calculated by K–L plots:

$$\frac{1}{i} = \frac{1}{i_{k}} + \frac{1}{i_{d}} = \frac{1}{nFAkC} + \frac{1}{0.2nFAD^{2/3}v^{-1/2}C\omega^{1/2}}$$
(1)

Where i is the measured current density on RDE,  $i_{\rm k}$  is kinetically limited current density and consists of the electron transfer number (n), the Faraday constant (F), the oxygen solubility (C) in the electrolyte, and the rate constant (k).  $i_d$  is the diffusion-limited

current density and consists of the electron transfer number, the Faraday constant, diffusivity of oxygen (D), kinematic viscosity (v), the oxygen solubility, and the rotation rate ( $\omega$ ).

The working electrode comprised a thin-film layer of catalyst on a glassy carbon disk (5 mm in diameter). For preparing the thin-film layer, 5 mg of the sample (comprised catalyst/Vulcan carbon = 2:3 mass ratio) was ultrasonicated in 1.5 mL isopropanol/DI water (2:1 v/v) with 15  $\mu$ L 5% Nafion solution as solvent for 30 min, and then 8 mL dropping liquid was transferred to the glassy carbon disk and then dried in the air. The total mass loading for each electrode was 200  $\mu$ g cm<sup>-2</sup>.

Characterization: The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained by D/max2550 V X-ray diffractometer using Cu<sub>ka</sub> radiation. The Raman spectra were measured by Laser MicrO-Raman Spectrometer using 532 nm laser. The X-ray absorption (XAS) data of the samples were recorded at room temperature in the transmission mode using ion chambers and the BL14 W1 beam line in the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF), China. The Brunner-Emmet-Teller (BET) surface area was carried out by Micromeritics Tristar 3020 SIN 993. The mapping images and physical morphology were determined by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM GeminiSEM 500) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, JEM-2100). The chemical composition and valence states of elements were examined by Xray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ESCALAB 250Xi) using a monochromatic Al<sub>Ka</sub> X-ray source. Binding energies were normalized with regard to exogenous C1 s.

Density functional theory (DFT) calculation: All crystal structure information and phase parameters were produced by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The crystal-cell model for density of states of  $O-CoS_2$  was obtained by shrinking the original crystal cell by 4%, which was according to the value of R in  $k^2$ -normalized Co-K edge EXAFS. The self-consistent field was considered to converge when energetic convergence threshold changed within  $1\times10^{-4}$  eV per atom. First-principles calculations were implemented in the Vienna Ab-initio Simulation Package (VASP). The spin-polarized DFT computations were performed with Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) generalized gradient approximation (GGA) for exchange-correlation interactions. A plane-wave cut-off energy of all computations was set to 400 eV.

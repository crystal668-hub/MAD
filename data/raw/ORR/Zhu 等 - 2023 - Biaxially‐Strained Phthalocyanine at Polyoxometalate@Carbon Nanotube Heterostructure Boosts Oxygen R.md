Abstract: Iron phthalocyanine (FePc) with unique FeN<sub>4</sub> site has attracted increasing interests as a promising nonprecious catalyst. However, the plane symmetric structure endows FePc with undesired catalytic performance toward the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Here, we report a novel one-dimensional heterostructured ORR catalyst by coupling FePc at polyoxometalate-encapsulated carbon nanotubes (FePc-{PW<sub>12</sub>}@NTs) using host-guest chemistry. The encapsulation of polyoxometalates can induce a local tensile strain of single-walled NTs to strengthen the interactions with FePc. Both the strain and curvature effects of {PW<sub>12</sub>}@NT scaffold tune the geometric structure and electronic localization of FeN<sub>4</sub> centers to enhance the ORR catalytic performance. As expected, such a heterostructured FePc-{PW<sub>12</sub>}@NT electrocatalyst exhibits prominent durability, methanol tolerance, and ORR activity with a high half-wave potential of 0.90 V and a low Tafel slope of 30.9 mV dec<sup>-1</sup> in alkaline medium. Besides, the assembled zinc-air battery demonstrates an ultrahigh power density of 280 mW cm<sup>-2</sup>, excellent charge/discharge ability and long-term stability over 500 h, outperforming that of the commercial Pt/C+IrO<sub>2</sub> cathode. This study offers a new strategy to design novel heterostructured catalysts and opens a new avenue to regulate the electrocatalytic performance of phthalocyanine molecules.

#### Introduction

The exceptionally high O=O bond energy (498 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>) and the sluggish kinetics of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) are recognized as critical obstacles in exploiting rechargeable zinc-air batteries (ZABs).[1] Platinum (Pt)-based catalysts have been utilized to enhance the ORR performance via desirable O2 adsorption and activation ability, whereas their large-scale applications are sternly hampered by the

high price, scarce reserve, limited long-term durability, and poor poison tolerance toward methanol.<sup>[2]</sup> Therefore, it is urgent to design highly active, stable and non-precious ORR catalysts as Pt alternatives. In recent years, single-atom catalysts of Fe-N-C materials show great promises due to their low cost, easy preparation and almost 100% atom utilization.[3] In many cases, the synthesis of Fe-N-C catalysts involves high temperature pyrolysis process, and the pyrolyzed products demonstrate remarkable ORR activity and durability.[4] However, the inevitable agglomeration and complicated chemical/electronic structure make it nettlesome to identify their true active sites, as well as the catalytic mechanism.<sup>[5]</sup> Accordingly, it remains a difficulty to achieve rational structural design and precise activity regulation of the pyrolyzed Fe-N-C catalysts for ORR.

As a kind of molecular Fe-N-C catalysts, iron phthalocyanine (FePc) possesses a definite tetracoordinate plane structure and has been observed the promising intrinsic ORR activity from transition metal-nitrogen chelates. [6] Despite all this, FePc sustains poor electrical conductivity (1.4–5.7×10<sup>-7</sup> S cm<sup>-1</sup>) and symmetric electron distribution, which are unbeneficial for the O2 adsorption and activation.<sup>[7]</sup> Some significant studies indicate that immobilization of iron phthalocyanine on curvatured carbon substrates (e.g., carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and onion-like carbon) is effective in addressing these issues.<sup>[8]</sup> Planar phthalocyanines molecules would undergo strong bending distortion and asymmetric charge distribution to increase the contact area with carbons. The steric curvature effect causes the weakened interaction between metal atoms and N ligands, thus tailoring the electronic structure of metal centers to enhance the adsorption strength of reaction

intermediates and boost the catalytic performance.[9] As a rational design, electronic modulation of FePc by axial coordination on these curvatured carbon substrates represents a promising approach for more positive half-wave potential and better durability.[10] Generally, the organic ligands (e.g., oxygenic, nitrogenous and sulfurous species) with rich electron-donating functional groups can be easily utilized to interact with FePc and elevate its ORR activity.[11] Nevertheless, these organic ligands and heteroatom groups tend to weaken the predominant π-π interactions between FePc and substrates, resulting in the molecular agglomeration and/or falling off during preparation or long-term testing processes.[12] Theoretical calculation has predicted the very strong interactions between metal phthalocyanines complexes and single-walled CNT (SWNT) sidewalls with a high binding energy of 32.74–45.35 kcalmol <sup>1</sup> . [13] Besides, the strong donor-acceptor and π-π conjugation interactions enable highly ordered face-on packing of phthalocyanines on the surface of SWNTs and efficient interfacial charge transport.[14] These findings offer a new platform to tune the electronic structure and catalytic activity of FePc on SWNTs.

In this work, we report a host-guest self-assembly strategy to synthesize highly efficient and durable ORR catalyst with a one-dimensional (1D) molecular heterostructure. FePc guest molecules are immobilized on the outer surface of SWNTs encapsulated with Keggin-type phosphotungstic acid (denoted as FePc-{PW12}@NTs). The {PW12} encapsulated SWNTs undergo a local tensile strain, both the strain effect and curvature effect help optimize the geometric and electronic structure of FePc to improve the catalytic performance. As expected, such a 1D heterostructured FePc-{PW12}@NT electrocatalyst exhibits prominent activity toward the ORR in alkaline medium, as well as the excellent charge/discharge ability and long-term durability as air cathode in ZABs.

## *Results and Discussion*

#### *Encapsulation of polyoxometalates*

Figure 1a depicts the schematic illustration for the preparation of FePc-{PW12}@NT catalyst. As the host molecules, the tube ends of SWNTs (average diameter: �1.4 nm) are

*Figure 1.* Encapsulation of polyoxometalates within SWNTs. (a) Schematic illustration for the preparation of FePc-{PW12}@NT and FePc-{PW12}/NT catalysts. Aberration-corrected HAADF-STEM images of {PW12}/NT (b) and {PW12}@NT (c) hybrids.

opened to allow polyoxometalate encapsulation. Air heating is an effective and widely used method to open SWNTs' ends, and the oxidation reactions generally occur at the defect sites of SWNTs. As shown in Figures S1, S2, the Ni/Y catalyst is removed after treating by sulfuric acid, and the specific surface area of the open SWNTs increases from 222.6 to 547.8 m2 g <sup>1</sup> , evidencing that the inner surface of SWNTs has been exposed. Here the heteropolyacid of H3PW12O40 ({PW12}, �1 nm in size) is chosen as a guest molecule. A redox-driven host-guest strategy has been used to confine {PW12} clusters within the inner cavities of SWNTs.[15] Subsequently, the hybrid of {PW12}@NT acts as matrix to anchor active FePc molecules via π-π interactions, forming the 1D heterostructured FePc-{PW12}@NT catalyst. For comparison, the end-closed SWNTs have also been utilized to prepare FePc-{PW12}/NT as a control catalyst, where the {PW12} and FePc molecules are immobilized on the outer surface of nanotubes.

The micro-morphologies of two hybrid materials including {PW12}/NTs and {PW12}@NTs were characterized by the aberration-corrected high-angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM). As shown in Figure 1b, we can observe that the bright dots randomly distribute on the SWNTs, indicating that {PW12} clusters irregularly locate on the outer surface of SWNTs and some clusters even aggregate. As for the {PW12}@NT in Figure 1c and Figure S3, the {PW12} clusters are sterically constrained and arranged into a peapod-like chain within the inner tube to form 1D heterostructure. The infrared spectrum of {PW12}/NTs is similar to bulk {PW12} sample, whereas the characteristic vibrations corresponding to {PW12} are almost absent for {PW12}@NTs in the region of 800–1100 cm <sup>1</sup> (Figure S4). These findings evidence that polyoxometalate clusters are well confined in the SWNT cavities for {PW12}@NTs. As for XPS spectra of {PW12}@NTs and {PW12}/NTs, the binding energies of W *4f7/2* (36.1 eV) and W *4f5/2* (38.2 eV) are lower than {PW12} alone, indicative of the reduced valence state of W species (Figure S5).[16] SWNTs can stabilize the electron-attracting {PW12} guests within 1D channels or outer surface by donating their electrons to clusters. After incorporation with {PW12}, no obvious shifts are observed in the binding energies of Fe *2p1/2* and Fe *2p3/2* for two samples (Figure S6). Raman spectra of these samples were recorded with the laser excitation of 532 and 633 nm (Figures S7, S8). Relative to the empty SWNTs, the *G* band of {PW12}@NT displays a positive shift accompanied with a variation in the peak shape, which is ascribed to the charge transfer induced interactions between SWNTs and confined {PW12} clusters.

#### *Characterization and catalytic activity*

{PW12}/NTs and {PW12}@NTs have been used as matrices for supporting FePc molecules through the π-π conjugation interactions. The schematic illustration of FePc-{PW12}@NT catalyst is depicted in Figure 2a, where FePc is anchored on the outer surface of the {PW12}@NTs. The morphology of such a 1D heterostructured catalyst has been observed by HAADF-STEM (Figure 2b), {PW12} clusters are still well stabilized and arrayed by the nanoconfinement effect of SWNTs after loading FePc. The STEM-energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) elemental mapping in Figure 2c reveals that C, W, P, N, and Fe elements are evenly distributed along the SWNTs. The infrared spectra and Raman profiles further confirm the propitious synthesis of as-designed FePc-{PW12} @NT catalyst, from which we can find the signals of FePc (Figures S9, S10). Figures S11, S12 provide the structure diagrams of FePc-{PW12}/NTs, in which the {PW12} clusters locate on the SWNT surface and interact with FePc via the Fe-O coordination. This is evidenced by Fe *2p* XPS spectra in Figure S13, where FePc-{PW12}/NT shows a higher ratio of Fe-O bonds (54.1%) than that in FePc (31.5%), implying more axial O coordination with FeN4 sites outside the SWNTs. The STEM and element mapping images of FePc- {PW12}/NT catalyst can be found in Figure S14.

The ORR performances of as-prepared catalysts were evaluated in O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH medium using a typical three-electrode configuration with a rotating disk electrode (RDE). All potentials were referenced to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). As displayed in Figure 2d, the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves indicate that FePc-{PW12}@NTs exhibit the best ORR catalytic activity with a half-wave potential (*E*1/2) of 0.90 V, higher than that of commercial 20 wt.% Pt/C (0.85 V) and FePc-NTs (0.88 V). Meanwhile, the limiting diffusion current density (JL) of FePc-{PW12}@NTs is close to 6.0 mAcm <sup>2</sup> , surpassing that of Pt/C (�5.4 mAcm <sup>2</sup> ) and FePc-NTs (�5.7 mAcm <sup>2</sup> ). As depicted in Figure 2e, the favorable ORR kinetics of FePc-{PW12}@NTs is evidenced by the much lower Tafel slope of 30.9 mVdec <sup>1</sup> , compared to that of Pt/C (85.6 mVdec <sup>1</sup> ) and FePc-NT (38.3 mVdec <sup>1</sup> ) catalysts. Besides, the kinetic current density (Jk) is also a measure of the reaction kinetics of electrocatalysts, the larger Jk value means the superior kinetics during ORR process.[2d,17] Impressively, FePc-{PW12}@NTs deliver a Jk of 65.8 mAcm <sup>2</sup> at 0.8 V, which is about two times that of FePc-NTs (37.8 mAcm <sup>2</sup> ) and three times that of Pt/C (21.9 mAcm <sup>2</sup> ) (Figure 2f). The ORR pathway of FePc- {PW12}@NTs is investigated by the RDE tests, the calculated electron transfer number (n) is �3.9, (Figure S15), suggesting a high-efficiency four-electron process from O2 to OH . As shown in Figure S16, the FePc-{PW12}@NTs also depicts a superior methanol tolerance for the ORR compared with the Pt/C catalyst.

As a comparison, the ORR activity of FePc-{PW12}/NT catalyst has been evaluated and its LSV curve is provided in Figure S17. It also presents a desirable *E*1/2 of 0.89 V and a low Tafel slope of 25.4 mVdec <sup>1</sup> . However, the poor longterm durability limits its application (Figure S18), which is possibly attributed to the solubility and instability of exposed {PW12} molecules in the alkaline solution. In contrast, the FePc-{PW12}@NT catalyst demonstrates a greatly enhanced stability, even superior to Pt/C and FePc-NTs (Figure 2g). The STEM images in Figure S19 reveal that {PW12} clusters are still well encapsulated within the SWNTs after cycling tests, whereas which are unable to evenly distribute on the SWNT surface for FePc-{PW12}/NT.

Comparison of *E*1/2 (h) and Tafel slope (i) values of FePc-{PW12}@NT with similar reported catalysts.

Instead, the outer clusters tend to agglomerate and form large particles, leading to the falling off of FePc (Figure S20). These results fully highlight the nanoconfinement effect of SWNTs, which plays a critical role in improving the electrochemical stability of {PW12} and accordingly the ORR performance of FePc-{PW12}@NTs.[18] Particularly, the values of *E*1/2 and Tafel slope are comparable to the recently reported atomically-dispersed Fe based materials, as shown in Figures 2h, i and Table S1.

#### *Structure analysis and theoretical calculations*

The causes for superior ORR activity of FePc-{PW12}@NT catalyst have been investigated. According to the DFT calculations, the FePc alone shows a planar symmetric structure with the similar lengths of Fe-N bond (Figure 3a). For FePc-NT sample (Figures 3b and S21a), FePc would undergo a bending distortion to increase the contact area with substrate outer surface via π-π interactions. As a result, the curvature effect of SWNTs breaks the molecular symmetry and shortens the bond lengths of Fe-N(1) and Fe-N(3). Besides, the N(1)-Fe-N(3) and N(2)-Fe-N(4) angles decrease from about 180° to near 177°. The encapsulation of {PW12} clusters within SWNTs can further change the geometric configuration of FePc and reduce its symmetry (Figures 3c and S21b). Figure S22 reveals that the inner {PW12} induces the local structure deformation of nanotube, with 4.5% and 3.4% tensile strains along the *a* and *b* axis, respectively. Both curvature and strain effects of the {PW12} @NT scaffold lead to form biaxially strained FePc. As provided in Figure 3d, the bond lengths of Fe-N(1) and Fe-N(3) are shorter than those in the plane FePc molecule and close to 1.926 Å (compressive strain), whereas that for Fe-N(2) and Fe-N(4) prolong to 1.936 Å (tensile strain). Similar evolutions are found for the N-Fe-N angles, *<*N(1)-Fe-N(3) shortens to 178° while *<*N(2)-Fe-N(4) approaches to 176° (Figure 3e and Table S2). To probe the local electronic structure of the FePc in FePc-{PW12}@NTs, the X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) is collected. The pre-edge peak around 7100 eV in the Fe *K-*edge XANES spectra is identified to square-planar and centrosymmetric FeN4 center of FePc (Figure 3f). Its positive shift and lower intensity in FePc-{PW12}@NT than FePc reference verify the alterant electronic localization of Fe and broken molecular symmetry, arising from the strong electronic interactions with

{PW12}@NT scaffold.[11b] As shown in Figure 3g, the prominent peak at �1.5 Å represents the Fe-N bond, in which the FePc-{PW12}@NT depicts a bit shorter bond length than that of FePc, agreeing well with the above discussions. The EXAFS fitting results of FePc and FePc-{PW12}@NT at *R* space are provided in Figure S23, and the fitting parameters can be found in Table S3. The average Fe-N length in FePc- {PW12}@NT is 1.9312 Å, a bit shorter than that in FePc (1.9320 Å). Overall, the {PW12} with high valence state (VI) of tungsten, shows strong oxidizing ability. On the one hand, the electron transfer from SWNTs to clusters triggers the redox-driven encapsulation of {PW12} into SWNTs. On the other hand, the encapsulated {PW12} can alter the geometric and electronic structure of SWNTs, thus causing the strain and curvature effects and providing unique interactions with FePc to enhance the ORR catalytic activity.

Figures 4a–d show the differential charge density maps of FePc molecule on SWNT and {PW12}@NT, where yellow is electron gain and blue is electron loss. Compared with SWNT, {PW12}@NT donates less electrons to FePc, this is because that in hybrid structure, SWNT also donates partial electron for inner {PW12} clusters to stabilize them. The results are revealed by the data of Bander charge in Figure 4e, where the charges transfer from SWNT and {PW12}@NT are 0.16 and 0.09 *e*, respectively. It can be seen from the adsorption energy data that {PW12}@NT has a higher adsorption energy of 1.72 eV for FePc, relative to that of the SWNTs (1.67 eV). This may be ascribed to the biaxial strain effect.[19] The encapsulation of {PW12} clusters inside SWNTs induces a local tensile strain of nanotubes and tailors the molecular symmetry of FePc, leading to more stable hybrid structure. Additionally, the structural evolution and electronic localization can adjust the charge distribution and coordination environment of Fe atom, the ORR catalytic activity of Fe-N4 centers may be thus regulated.[20] To verify this inference, the free energies of ORR pathways on FePc, FePc-NT, FePc-{PW12}/NT, and FePc-{PW12}@NT are analyzed. The optimized structures of ORR intermediates (\*OH, \*O, and \*OOH) on Fe-N4 sites of different catalysts are depicted in Figures S24–S27. As shown in Figure 4f, the fourth reduction step (\*OH+e– ! OH–+\*) is the rate-determining step of FePc and FePc-

{PW12}@NT catalysts, while the FePc-{PW12}@NT shows a lower activation barrier of 0.45 eV than FePc (0.51 eV). As for the FePc-NT, the third reduction step (\*O+H2O!\*OH +OH– ) becomes the rate-determining step and its activation barrier is 0.47 eV. Therefore, the 1D molecular heterostructure of {PW12}@NT with strain and curvature effects can improve the FePc adsorption and boost the intrinsic ORR activity. For comparison, the activation barrier of FePc- {PW12}/NT is determined as 0.41 eV in Figure S28, agreeing well with the aforementioned electrochemical findings.

#### *Performance of zinc-air batteries*

To further evaluate the practicability of the FePc-{PW12} @NT catalyst, a aqueous ZAB was assembled with the zinc plate as anode and 6.0 M KOH+0.2 M Zn(OAc)2 as electrolyte, as shown in Figure S29. Owing to the high ORR catalytic activity of the FePc-{PW12}@NT, the ZAB exhibits a stable open circuit potential of 1.39 V (Figure 5a), exceeding to that of the control group (20% Pt/C+IrO2 catalyst: 1.29 V). As shown in the V–J polarization and corresponding power density plots (Figure 5b), the FePc-{PW12}@NT based ZAB presents a peak power density over 280 mWcm <sup>2</sup> , which is almost two times that of the commercial Pt/C+IrO2. As can be seen in Figure S30, the ZAB demonstrates the highest discharge voltages of 1.35, 1.33, 1.31, 1.29, and 1.26 V at the current densities of 1, 2, 5, 10, and 20 mAcm <sup>2</sup> , respectively. Once the current density recovers to 1 mAcm <sup>2</sup> , the discharge voltage returns to 1.34 V, implying the prominent rate performance of the ZAB with FePc-{PW12}@NT cathode. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) plots are measured and displayed in Figure 5c, in which the smaller semicircle diameter of FePc-{PW12}@NT based ZAB represents a lower charge transfer resistance.[21] The fast mass transport and accelerated reaction kinetics of FePc-{PW12}@NT cathode play a crucial role for the superior electrochemical performance of the assembled ZAB.

The rechargeability and long-term durability of the FePc-{PW12}@NT based ZAB have been investigated by galvanostatic discharge/charge cycling tests. As provided in Figure 5d, the cell shows stable charge-discharge behavior for more than 500 cycles (over a period of 500 h) at 10 mAcm <sup>2</sup> , which is superior than that of Pt/C+IrO2 based ZAB within 200 h. Impressively, the FePc-{PW12}@NT based ZAB displays negligible performance loss with a small voltage gap of 0.75 V and a round-trip efficiency of 61.1% after 500 cycles (Figure 5e and Figure S31). Overall, the electrochemical performances of FePc-{PW12}@NT based ZAB at room temperature are highly competitive with many reported Fe-catalyst based ZABs (Table S4).

## *Conclusion*

In summary, an efficient ORR catalyst of FePc-{PW12}@NT has been designed through the host-guest assembly strategy. The SWNTs stabilize the encapsulated polyoxometalate clusters in alkaline medium, and the confined polyoxometa-

lates cause a local structure deformation of SWNTs, resulting in a high adsorption energy with FePc. Benefiting from the strain and curvature effects of {PW12}@NT scaffold, the geometric and electronic structures of biaxially-strained FePc are regulated to improve the ORR catalytic performance. The as-prepared FePc-{PW12}@NT catalyst with 1D heterostructure exhibits excellent ORR activity with a high half-wave potential of 0.90 V and a low Tafel slope of 30.9 mVdec <sup>1</sup> , surpassing the commercial Pt/C catalyst. Besides, it achieves both structure and performance stability, as well as desirable methanol tolerance. The zinc-air battery with FePc-{PW12}@NT cathode demonstrates a high power density of 280 mWcm <sup>2</sup> and outstanding long-term stability over 500 h. Given the properties and the structure-activity relationships of FePc-{PW12}@NTs, which show great promise in energy electrocatalysis.

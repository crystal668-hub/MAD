Peng Rao, Junming Luo, Daoxiong Wu\*, Jing Li, Qi Chen, Peilin Deng\*, Yijun Shen, and Xinlong Tian\*

Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is the heart of many new energy conversions and storage devices, such as metal-air batteries and fuel cells. However, ORR is currently facing the dilemma of sluggish intrinsic kinetics and the noble electrocatalysts of high price and low reserves. In this work, isolated Co atoms anchored on defective nitrogen-doped carbon graphene single-atom catalyst (Co-SAC/NC) are synthesized via the proposed movable type printing method. The prepared Co-SAC/NC catalyst demonstrates admirable ORR performance, with a high half-wave potential of 0.884 V in alkaline electrolytes and outstanding durability. In addition, an assembled zinc-air battery with prepared Co-SAC/NC as air-cathode catalyst displays a high-peak power density of 179 mW cm<sup>-2</sup> and a high-specific capacity (757 mAh g<sup>-1</sup>). Density functional theory calculations confirm that the true active sites of the prepared catalyst are Co-N<sub>4</sub> moieties, and further reveal a significantly electronic structure evolution of Co sites in the ORR process, in which the project density of states and local magnetic moment of Co atom varies during its whole reaction process. This work not only paves a new avenue for synthesizing SACs as robust electrocatalysts, but also provides an electronic-level insight into the evolution of the electronic structure of single-atom catalysts.

#### 1. Introduction

Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is the key point of many new energy conversions and storage technologies, such as fuel cells and metal-air batteries. [1-4] However, the sluggish kinetics of the ORR process seriously limits the performance and applications of the new energy devices. [5-10] Pt-based materials are the state-of-the-art catalysts for catalyzing ORR, while their high-price and low-reserve cover a shadow over the wide application of the Pt-based ORR

catalysts, as well as the further application and development of the new energy devices. [11-15] Hence, it is still urgently needed to explore high-active and low-price ORR catalysts to alleviate the reliance on the Pt-based ORR catalysts and promote the development of the new energy industries.

In recent years, single-atom catalysts (SACs) have attracted numerous attention and exhibited excellent activity and selectivity in many reactions, which are attributed to the super-high atom utilization (close to 100%), uniform active sites, and the unique electronic structure.[16-21] For instance. Chen et al.[22] reported a homogeneous iridium porphyrin-like Ir-N-C SAC (Ir-SAC) as highefficient ORR catalysts, with a mass activity of 12.2 A  $mg^{-1}_{Tr}$  at 0.85 V. Shao et al. [23] prepared atomically dispersed Fe active sites in Fe-N-C SACs via the proposed "ceriaassisted" strategy, and the resultant catalyst exhibited a half-wave potential of 0.915 V toward ORR. Liu et al.[24] designed single Fe atoms anchored on defective carbon supports and coordinated with four nitrogen atoms

SACs as ORR catalysts, with an onset potential and half-wave potential of 0.91 and 0.79 V, respectively. In short, the SACs have demonstrated good activity and huge potential as the ORR catalysts. However, there are still some important issues that need to be addressed. On the one hand, the reported methods to synthesize SACs usually require complicated experimental design and processes, owing to the disparate coordination environment between various metal atoms and defect types. In addition, the activity and durability of the SACs are still far from the requirement for the commercial operations.

Herein, isolated Co atoms anchored on defective nitrogen-doped carbon graphene single-atom catalysts were synthesized via the proposed movable type printing method. The resultant catalyst demonstrates robust ORR performance in both rotation desk electrode (RDE) and assembled zinc-air batteries (ZABs). In addition, with the help of DFT calculations, a potential electronic evolution of Co-N<sub>4</sub> active sites in the ORR process is demonstrated by tracking the changes in the electronic structure during the reaction process, providing a deep understanding of the related reaction mechanism in the Co-SACs.

#### 2.1. Synthesis and Characterizations of SACs

The prepared catalysts were synthesized via the proposed movable type printing method (Figure 1a, more detailed information is shown in the "Experiment" section). Briefly, the metal precursors and melamine were uniformly mixed and annealed in air atmosphere to obtain the printing templates (denoted as the M-g-C3N4). Subsequently, dopamine hydrochloride was coated on the prepared printing templates, and then, the metal atoms of the printing templates are excited and stripped by the high-temperature pyrolysis, point-to-point transferred from printing templates to the carbon supports, as well as captured and stabilized by defects and nitrogen species, resulting in SACs.

The diffraction peaks in the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of Co-g-C3N4 are well assigned to g-C3N4, without any other peaks, suggesting no Co nanoparticles or clusters exist in/on Co-g-C3N4 (Figure S1, Supporting Information).[\[25\]](#page-5-0) In addition, the TEM image of Co-g-C3N4 reveals that the prepared printing templates are uniform nanoplates, which is consistent with the previous works (Figure 1b).[[25](#page-5-0)[27](#page-5-0)] Meanwhile, no signals of the metal nanoparticles or clusters are observed on the nanosheets (Figure 1b). There are various bright dots are observed on the aberration-corrected high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (AC HAADF-STEM) image, which should be assigned to the isolated Co atoms (Figure 1c). Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mapping images of Co-g-C3N4 reveal that Co and N elements are uniformly distributed on carbon supports (Figure 1d). All characterization results of Co-g-C3N4 confirm the typical single-atom features of prepared printing templates, which is vital for preparing SACs via the proposed movable type printing method.

Figure 1e displays the TEM image of Co-SAC/NC, revealing a typical carbon graphene nanostructure of Co-SAC/NC, such unique nanostructure usually endows high-specific surface areas and more anchored sites for isolated metal atoms, which are the important factors for good electrocatalysts.[[8,28,29\]](#page-5-0) The XRD pattern of Co-SAC/NC exhibits only typical carbon peaks, and there are no Co signals observed in the XRD pattern, suggesting no Co nanoparticles or clusters in Co-SAC/NC (Figure S2, Supporting Information). Some isolated bright dots are uniformly dispersed on the carbon graphene supports, confirmed by the AC HAADF-STEM image of Co-SAC/NC (Figure 1f). The isolated bright dots on the carbon supports are considered to be atomically dispersed Co atoms.[[24,30\]](#page-5-0) Furthermore, EDS mapping images of Co-SAC/ NC suggest that Co and N elements are uniformly distributed over the whole carbon graphene supports (Figure 1g). The inductively coupled plasma optically emitting spectrometer measurement (ICP-OES) result

reveals that the metal loading of the Co in Co-SAC/NC is as high as 3.42 wt.%. All characterization data confirm that the isolated Co atoms anchored on carbon supports are successfully prepared via the proposed movable type printing method. Moreover, the confirmation of the single-atom characteristics of Co-SAC/NC also proves that the metal atoms should be point to point transferred from the printing templates to the carbon supports, preventing the agglomeration of the metals.

The Raman spectrum of Co-SAC/NC is shown in Figure S3, Supporting Information, the ID:IG value of Co-SAC/NC is calculated as 1.06. The higher value of the ID: IG usually indicates more defects on the prepared carbon supports.[\[31\]](#page-5-0) The defective carbon supports could offer more powerful anchored sites for the isolated metal atoms. The high-resolution N 1s XPS peaks of the pure carbon supports (named as NC) and Co-SAC/NC show four dominated peaks, which could be assigned to the pyridinic N (398.3 eV), pyrrolic N (399.8 eV), graphitic N (400.9 eV), and oxidized N (402.4 eV) (Figure S4, Supporting Information).[\[32,33](#page-5-0)] In addition, there is also a peak observed only in Co-SAC/NC at about 399.2 eV, which must attribute to the Co-Nx.[\[32,33\]](#page-5-0) The high-resolution Co XPS peak demonstrates two group obvious peaks at about 780.5/796.1 eV and 786.1/803.5 eV, corresponding to the Co2<sup>+</sup> and related satellite peaks (Figure S5, Supporting Information). The absence of the metallic Co also suggests no Co nanoparticles or clusters in prepared Co-SAC/NC.

X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) is carried out to determine the fine electronic structure and coordination environment of the Co species in Co-SAC/NC. X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) curves of Co K-edge in Co-SAC/NC and standard species (e.g., Co foil and CoO) are shown in Figure 2a. The position of the absorption edge of Co-SAC/NC locates between the Co foil and CoO, suggesting the valence state of Co-SAC/NC is between the 0 and+2. Fourier transform (FT)-extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy of Co-SAC/NC shows a dominant peak at approximately 1.45 Å, which could be assigned to the first coordination shell of Co-N (Figure 2b).<sup>[34]</sup> The absence of the Co-Co peaks in the FT-EXAFS spectrum of Co-SAC/NC further reveals that the atomic dispersion of Co atoms on the prepared carbon graphene supports. [35] The coordination structure of the Co species in Co-SAC/NC is further obtained by using quantitative least-squares EXAFS curvefitting. [36] The best-fitting results reveal that the isolated Co atoms are coordinated with N atoms, with a coordination number of  $4.1 \pm 0.3$  (Figure 2c,d and Table S1, Supporting Information). Wavelet transform (WT)-EXAFS image of the Co foil shows that the maximum intensity was at about 7.0  $\mathring{A}^{-1}$ , which can be attributed to the contribution of the Co-Co (Figure 2e).[37] As for Co-SAC/NC, only one bright signal is observed at about 3.0  $\mathring{A}^{-1}$ , which should be due to the contribution of the Co-N (Figure 2e). [37] Therefore, the isolated Co atoms uniformly anchored on the carbon supports and coordinated with N species are further verified by the WT-EXAFS results, which is consistent with the results of AC HAADF-STEM and FT-EXAFS results (Figures 1f and 2b-d).

#### 2.2. Electrocatalytic Performance of Co-SAC/NC

The ORR performance of Co-SAC/NC is evaluated by a three-electrode system in 0.1 M KOH. The ORR activity of the NC, Co-g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>, and Pt/ C is also tested as comparisons. Co-SAC/NC delivers an excellent ORR performance, with a high-onset potential of 1.019 V, half-wave potential of 0.884 V, and a high kinetic current density of 3.480 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> at 0.9 V, which are much outperforming the NC and Pt/C (Figure 3a, b and Figure S6, Table S2, Supporting Information). The formation of peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) and electrode transfer number (n) during the ORR process of Co-SAC/NC has been tested via the rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE) measurements. The H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> yield of Co-SAC/NC is lower than 11%, and the electrode transfer number is calculated at about 3.8 at the potential range of 0.3-0.8V, indicating a close to the 4-electron process of Co-SAC/NC toward ORR. In addition, Co-SAC/NC also exhibits robust durability and stability, with only 6 mV decay of halfwave potential after ADT tests. The excellent stability of Co-SAC/NC is confirmed by the chronoamperometry (CA) test, revealing a 10 % decay after 30 000 s CA test (Figure 3e). In contrast, the current density retentions of Pt/C remained at 81% of its initial current density value under the same CA parameters (Figure 3e). Moreover, the ORR performance of Co-SAC/NC is superior to most previously reported Co-based SACs ORR catalysts (Figure 3f and Table S3, Supporting

To explore the potential practical application of prepared Co-SAC/NC catalyst, a homemade ZAB is assembled with the prepared catalyst acting as the air-cathode catalyst, and Pt/C is also used as the cathode

catalyst of fabricated ZAB as the benchmark. Co-SAC/NC-based ZAB delivers a high-specific capacity of as high as 757 mAh g $^{-1}_{Zn}$ , which is much higher than that of Pt/C-based ZAB (612 mAh g $^{-1}_{Zn}$ ) (Figure 3g). Furthermore, the discharging ability of Co-SAC/NC-based ZAB significantly outperforms Pt/C, with a high-peak power density of 179 mW cm $^{-2}$ , while Pt/C-based ZAB is only 140 mW cm $^{-2}$  (Figure 3h). Moreover, Co-SAC/NC-based ZAB displays considerable rate performance (Figure 3i). All the ZAB results confirm the superior ORR performance of Co-SAC/NC catalyst in ZAB. The excellent ORR performance in both three-electrode system and ZAB level demonstrates the huge potential of Co-SAC/NC catalyst. On the contrary, the robust activity of prepared Co-SAC/NC could be attributed to the high density and uniform Co-N<sub>4</sub> active sites.

#### 2.3. DFT Calculations

Spin-polarized density functional calculations were carried out to shed light on the reaction mechanism of Co SACs with superior ORR activity. According to the best-fitting EXAFS results, that each Co atom binding with about four N atoms, a Co-N4-C model is adopted in our calculations (Figure 2c,d, Figure S7, and Table S1, Supporting Information). The theoretical overpotential of the Co-N<sub>4</sub>-C is estimated as small as 0.23 V, suggesting its superior ORR activity and agreeing with our experimental results (Figures 3a and 4a). The ORR reaction cycle catalyzed by the Co-N<sub>4</sub>-C is displayed in Figure 4b. In this reaction cycle, the Co atom is pulled out of the graphene plane and then recovery. There is not only structural change but also significantly electronic structure evolution in the Co-N<sub>4</sub> moiety during the whole ORR process. The pristine Co-N<sub>4</sub>, Co-N<sub>4</sub> binding with OOH species (denoted as OOH\*), and Co-N<sub>4</sub> binding with O species (denoted as O\*) configurations are spin-polarized with a large Co local magnetic moment of 0.98, 0.49, and 2.64  $\mu_B$ , respectively, while the Co-N<sub>4</sub> binding with OH species (denoted as OH\*) configuration is unpolarized with a negligible Co local magnetic moment of 0.03  $\mu_B$ , see the related data summarized in Table S4, Supporting Information and spin-charge density showed in Figure 4b. Note that there is a large magnetic moment of 0.52  $\mu_B$  in the adsorbed oxygen atom in the O\* configuration, possibly

<span id="page-4-0"></span>**Figure 4.** Theoretical calculations on the ORR mechanism of Co-N<sub>4</sub>-C. a) Potential energy profiles of the Co-N<sub>4</sub>-C in the ORR cycle under the electrode potential U=0 V and U=1.00 V. b) Spin-charge density with the iso-surface value of 0.05 e/Bohr<sup>3</sup>, c) projected density of states, and d) decomposed atomic orbital magnetic moment (DAOMM) of the Co-N<sub>4</sub>-C in the ORR cycle.

arising from its partial-filled p shell. The calculated project density of states (PDOS) of Co's d orbital and O's s+p orbitals is plotted in Figure 4c, which reveals an asymmetric PDOS between spin-up and spin-down channel in the spin-polarized system (Co-N<sub>4</sub>-C, OOH\*, and O\*) and a symmetric PDOS graph in the OH\* system. There is significant overlapping between Co's PDOS and O's PDOS in the energy range of -6 to 0 eV, implying a strong orbital hybridization between Co's d orbitals and O's s + p orbitals. It is speculated that this strong interaction between Co and O dominates the structural even electronic structural evolution in the whole ORR process. Moreover, the decomposed atomic orbital magnetic moment (DAOMM), estimated by the difference in the integrated PDOS of atomic orbital at the Fermi level in the spin-up and spin-down channel, is calculated to uncover the origin of the magnetic

moment. As summarized in Figure 4d and Table \$5, Supporting Information, five atomic d orbitals of Co atom exhibit a negligible even zero DAOMM in the spin-unpolarized OH\* configuration. The  $d_{z2}$  orbital with a large DAOMM value is the major contributor to the magnetic moment located in Co atoms in Co- $N_4$ -C (DAOMM = 0.84  $\mu_B$ ) and OOH\* systems (DAOMM = 0.43  $\mu_B$ ). For O\* system, five d orbitals with DAOMM from 0.20 to  $0.67 \mu_B$  make joint contributions, leading to a quite large local magnetic moment of 2.64  $\mu_B$ in Co atoms. These various spin states of Co atoms reflect the significant effect of the reactive intermediate species on the electronic structure of the active sites in Co-N<sub>4</sub>-C during the ORR process.

#### 3. Conclusion

In this work, a high-efficient ORR catalyst with isolated Co atoms anchored on defective nitrogen-doped carbon graphene is successfully synthesized via the proposed movable type printing method. The prepared Co-SAC/ NC catalyst exhibits excellent ORR activity and durability, and is more attractive than the most reported Co-based SACs. Moreover, the prepared catalyst also delivers favorable discharge performance and energy density when acting as the air-cathode catalyst of assembled ZAB. Furthermore, the theoretical calculations confirm the superior ORR activity should be attributed to the Co-N<sub>4</sub> moiety and further unveil the related electronic structure evolution of Co sites arising from the potential strong interaction between Co and O atoms during the ORR process. Our work combines both experimentally and theoretically studies to provide a novel and high-efficient synthesis strategy as well as some new understanding for the design of high-performance SACs.

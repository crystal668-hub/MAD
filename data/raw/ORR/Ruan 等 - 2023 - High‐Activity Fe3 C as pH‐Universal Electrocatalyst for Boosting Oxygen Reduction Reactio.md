# **High-Activity Fe3C as pH-Universal Electrocatalyst for Boosting Oxygen Reduction Reaction and Zinc-Air Battery**

*Qi-Dong Ruan, Rui Feng, Jiu-Ju Feng, Yi-Jing Gao,\* Lu Zhang,\* and Ai-Jun Wang\**

**Transition metal catalysts are regarded as one of promising alternatives to replace traditional Pt-based catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). In this work, an efficient ORR catalyst is synthesized by confining Fe3C nanoparticles into N, S co-doped porous carbon nanosheets (Fe3C/N,S-CNS) via hightemperature pyrolysis, in which 5-sulfosalicylic acid (SSA) demonstrates as an ideal complexing agent for iron (**ΙΙΙ**) acetylacetonate while g-C3N4 behaves as a nitrogen source. The influence of the pyrolysis temperature on the ORR performance is strictly examined in the controlled experiments. The obtained catalyst exhibits excellent ORR performance (***E***1/2 = 0.86 V;** *E***onset = 0.98 V) in alkaline electrolyte, coupled by exhibiting the superior catalytic activity and stability (***E***1/2 = 0.83 V,** *E***onset = 0.95 V) to Pt/C in acidic media. In parallel, its ORR mechanism is carefully illustrated by the density functional theory (DFT) calculations, especially the role of the incorporated Fe3C played in the catalytic process. The catalyst-assembled Zn-air battery also exhibits a much higher power density (163 mW cm–2) and ultralong cyclic stability in the charge–discharge test for 750 h with a gap increase down to 20 mV. This study provides some constructive insights for preparation of advanced ORR catalysts in green energy conversion units correlated systems.**

# **1. Introduction**

The shortage of fossil resources and serious environmental pollution make metal-air battery and proton exchange membrane fuel cell popular for their facility, high efficiency, and environmental friendliness.[1] Particularly, oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is the key reaction in these devices, whose large overpotential and very slow kinetics severely limit the potential

development of these devices.[2] Therefore, advanced catalysts are demanded to improve the ORR performance. Particularly, Pt-based catalysts such as commercial Pt/C are thought to be the best ORR catalysts because of their low overpotential and high power density. However, it is hardly feasible for their large-scaled commercialization due to the disadvantages of Pt itself (e.g., high cost and poor stability).[3] Therefore, it is always urgent yet popular to search low-cost and highefficiency catalysts to substitute Pt/C.

Carbon materials attract a lot of interest because of their abundance, good electrical conductivity, high stability, and strong tolerance in acidic and alkaline environment. Encapsulation of transition metal carbide can effectively modulate the local electronic structure of carbon substrate to improve the catalytic activity, and protect the incorporated metal nanoparticles (NPs) from demetallization and dissolution by avoiding their direct contact with

the electrolyte. Additionally, the encapsulation of the metal NPs into carbon materials also contributes to the dispersion, thus improving the long-term stability.[4]

Beyond the above, heteroatom doping (e.g., N-doping and S-doping) is an effective strategy to further enhance the activity of carbon catalysts by changing the local charge distributions and spin density.[5] It reflects the synergistic effect of multiple compositions to reduce the binding energy of intermediates involved in the ORR, ultimately improving the catalytic performance.[6]

During the pyrolysis process, heteroatoms also have the ability to bind with metals to form diverse active centers. For instance, the doped N can form porphyrin-like FeN4 sites with Fe species, which is certified as one of the effective active sites for the ORR.[3c,7] Also, introduction of sulfur into carbon matrix through sulfidation can create more defects to increase the ORR activity,[8] coupled by forming Fe-S bond on the ORR functionality. As well, the embedded Fe3C NPs prove feasibility to improve the ORR features.[9] Nevertheless, it is complicated and difficult to illustrate the role of each composition played in the multicompositions involved Fe-based catalysts.

In this work, 5-sulfosalicylic acid (SSA), as one of common complexing agent, can chelate with iron (ΙΙΙ) acetylacetonate (Fe(acac)3) to confine Fe3C NPs into N, S co-doped porous carbon nanosheets (Fe3C/N,S-CNS) by high-temperature pyrolysis in the presence of g-C3N4. The ORR performance of

the obtained  ${\rm Fe_3C/N,S\text{-}CNS}$  was studied in either alkaline or acidic environment, and elucidated the catalytic mechanism via the density functional theory (DFT) calculations, coupled by exploring its application in home-assembled Zn-air battery.

## 2. Results and Discussion

#### 2.1. Characterizations

Figure 1 shows the scheme for preparation of Fe<sub>3</sub>C/N,S-CNS in the presence of g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> by first mixing SSA and Fe(acac)<sub>3</sub> under stirring, accompanied by pyrolyzing at 800 °C in N2 atmosphere. The surface morphology of the typical sample was carefully characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM).[10] The SEM image (Figure 2A) exhibits layered thin sheet-like nanostructures, which would effectively enlarge the specific surface area.[11] What's more, the controlled samples (obtained at different pyrolysis temperature) figured out the effect of the pyrolysis temperature on their morphology (Figure S1A, Supporting Information). Observably, the layered thin nanosheets are hardly formed at a lower temperature (e.g., 700 °C), albeit with only several nanosheets decorated. Alternatively, the nanosheets are severely collapsed at a higher pyrolysis temperature (e.g., 900 °C, Figure S1B, Supporting Information). These results show the important influence of the temperature on the catalyst surface morphology.

In the meantime, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images (Figure 2B) show a large number of tiny dark particles (marked by the red circle) embedded in the sheet-like structures. Further, the distinct lattice fringes show up in the high-resolution TEM (HR-TEM) image (Figure 2C), with the interplanar spacing distance of 0.201 nm corresponding to the (031) crystal planes of Fe<sub>3</sub>C.<sup>[12]</sup> Clearly, the doped Fe<sub>3</sub>C NPs would enhance the contact area, and realize the maximum exposure of the active sites for the interfacial mass transport.<sup>[13]</sup>

Impressively, many carbon holes emerge after the acid treatment (Figure 2C, labeled by the yellow circle), owing to the efficient removal of the Fe<sub>3</sub>C particles. Figure 2D clearly illustrates the embedded Fe<sub>3</sub>C NPs in the carbon nanosheets, in which the interplanar distance of 0.21 nm corresponds to the (211) planes of Fe<sub>3</sub>C, while that of 0.34 nm is attributed to the (002) facets of graphitic carbon.<sup>[12,14]</sup> These phenomena demonstrate effective embedment of the Fe<sub>3</sub>C NPs in the carbon substrate, combined by coating with a thin graphitic carbon film. With  $\pi$ - $\pi$  interactions between carbon shell of Fe<sub>3</sub>C NPs and carbon sheets, Fe<sub>3</sub>C NPs show strong coupling with N, S-CNS, which are beneficial to the catalytic stability. Additionally, the successful incorporation of N, S, and Fe elements in the carbon matrix was certified by the respective scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) image and elemental mappings (Figure 2E) with the uniform distributions of C, N, S, and Fe elements.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was carried out to check the crystalline phase of the investigated catalysts. As depicted in Figure 3A, a diffraction peak at 26.3° corresponds to the (002) planes of graphitic carbon, while the other main peaks at 37.6°, 37.7°, 42.9°, 43.7°, 44.6°, 45.0°, 45.9°, 48.6°, and 49.1° are identified as the (121), (210), (211), (102), (220), (031), (112), (131), and (221) planes of the Fe<sub>3</sub>C (JCPDS 35-0772), respectively, which are in accordance with the HR-TEM analysis. As for the control samples, the Fe<sub>3</sub>C/N,S-CNS-700 shows a significant downward shift in the peak of graphitic carbon by contrast with the Fe<sub>3</sub>C/N,S-CNS-700, indicating insufficient graphitization caused by the lower pyrolysis temperature. Further, the Fe<sub>3</sub>C/N,S-CNS-700 exhibits the weaker Fe<sub>3</sub>C peaks than that of Fe<sub>3</sub>C/N,S-CNS, reflecting the less crystallinity of Fe<sub>3</sub>C in this case. [15] Alternatively, a large decrease in the crystallinity is certificated by the negligible Fe<sub>3</sub>C peak in the case of Fe<sub>3</sub>C/N,S-CNS-900 due to the destroyed structures at the excessively high temperature.<sup>[16]</sup>

Raman analysis was performed to further investigate the carbon structure of Fe<sub>3</sub>C/N,S-CNS (Figure 3B). Herein, two obvious peaks show up at 1358 and 1590 cm $^{-1}$ , [3a] referring to

**Figure 1.** Schematic description of the  $Fe_3C/N$ ,S-CNS.

the *D*-band (defective carbon) and *G*-band (graphitic carbon), respectively. Their peak intensity ratio (*I*D/*I*G) represents the defects and graphitization degree in the carbon-based catalysts. In particular, graphitic carbon is good for the electrical conductivity, while defective carbon would provide abundant active sites.[17] The Fe3C/N,S-CNS presents a *I*D/*I*G ratio of 0.99, which is coincidently located among those of the Fe3C/N,S-CNS-700 (1.02) and Fe3C/N,S-CNS-900 (0.98). The moderate ratio indicates that the catalyst achieves a good balance between the degree of graphitization and the defects of carbon. Therefore, the Fe3C/N,S-CNS with appropriate *I*D/*I*G ratio shows great promise to improve the electrocatalytic performance.

The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) analysis was carried out to probe the porous structure and enlarged surface area.[18] The mesopority of Fe3C/N,S-CNS is evidenced by the typical type-IV N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms (Figure 3C) and pore-size-distribution curve (Inset in Figure 3C). Also, the typical catalyst shows a large specific surface area of 374. m2 g–1 with an average pore size of 8.4 nm. These features would facilitate the availability of more active sites for the interfacial mass and/or charge transfer,[5a] in turn promoting the catalytic activity.

The surface compositions and valence states of Fe3C/N,S-CNS were strictly studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy

(XPS), which have close relationship with the catalytic performance. The full-scan XPS spectrum (Figure 3D) demonstrates the coexistence of C, N, O, S, and Fe elements in the typical sample. As revealed in Figure 3E, the Fe 2p segment can be well deconvoluted into four peaks, which corresponds to the 2p3/2 bands of Fe2+ (710.3 eV) and Fe3+ (714.7 eV) species, along with the 2p1/2 bands of Fe2+ (723.3 eV) and Fe3+ (727.1 eV) species.[19]

Figure 3F shows the C 1s segments, where the four peaks located at 284.7 eV for C–C=C, 285.6 eV for C–S/C=N, 287.3 eV for C–N–C, and 289.4 eV for O–C=O,[16] respectively. As seen in Figure 3G, the S 2p XPS part consists of three peaks, attributing to the Fe–Sx (161.5 eV), C–S (163.2 eV), C=S (165 eV), and S–Ox (168.5 eV),[20] respectively. Notably, the existence of C–S/ C=N is a good evidence for effective incorporation of S and N heteroatoms in the carbon skeleton.[21] Such entrapment would promote the availability of more active sites, finally contributing to the ORR performance.[22] Specifically, Fe–Sx can effectively accelerate the interfacial electron transfer in the ORR process, while C–S/C=S mainly plays a vital role to reduce the electron localization around the Fe3C active center.[23]

As shown in Figure 3H, the N 1 s XPS segment can be divided into five peaks correlated with pyridinic N (398.6 eV), pyrrolic N (400.1 eV), graphitic N (401.0 eV), oxidized N (404.2 eV), and Fe–Nx (399.6 eV).[16,24] Meantime, there display similar observations for the control samples (i.e., Fe3C/N,S-CNS-700 and Fe3C/N,S-CNS-900). As we can see visually from Figure 3I, there show up the highest total graphitic N and pyridinic N contents for Fe3C/N,S-CNS. Notably, the pyridinic N has a significant effect on the positive shift of the onset potential (*E*onset), while graphitic N can greatly increase the electrical conductivity and improve the catalytic property.[25] In addition, pyridinic N and graphitic N can create more active sites under the acidic condition.[1b]

### **2.2. Electrochemical Measurements**

The electrocatalytic property of Fe3C/N,S-CNS along with its control samples was probed by cyclic voltammetry (CV) in 0.1 m O2- and N2-saturated KOH solutions (**Figure 4**A). Obviously,

www.small-journal.com

there presents an obvious reduction peak in the CV curve of the  $Fe_3C/N,S$ -CNS under the  $O_2$ -saturated condition, while no characteristic peak is detected in the  $N_2$ -saturated environment. Moreover, the reduction peak of the  $Fe_3C/N,S$ -CNS is more positive than those of the  $Fe_3C/N,S$ -CNS-700 and  $Fe_3C/N,S$ -CNS-900 in the identical surroundings.

In order to further evaluate the ORR performance of the investigated catalyst, linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves were acquired in the O2-saturated electrolyte with the sweep rate of 50 mV s<sup>-1</sup> and the rotation rate of 1600 rpm (Figure 4B). Apparently, the Fe<sub>3</sub>C/N,S-CNS catalyst shows a high current density (5.8 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>), positive half-wave potential ( $E_{1/2}$ , 0.86 V) and onset potential ( $E_{\text{onset}}$ , 0.98 V). Impressively, the  $E_{\text{onset}}$ of Fe<sub>3</sub>C/N,S-CNS is 75, 19, and 20 mV greater than those of Fe<sub>3</sub>C/N,S-CNS-700, Fe<sub>3</sub>C/N,S-CNS-900 and Pt/C. Simultaneously, the  $E_{1/2}$  of Fe<sub>3</sub>C/N,S-CNS is more positive than those of Fe<sub>3</sub>C/N,S-CNS-700 (0.74 V versus RHE), Fe<sub>3</sub>C/N,S-CNS-900 (0.83 V versus RHE), and Pt/C (0.84 V versus RHE). The effect of different iron addition on the catalyst was also investigated, as shown in Figure S2 (Supporting Information). The Fe<sub>3</sub>C/N,S-CNS-0.5 with less iron addition exhibited a lower diffusion-limited currents, while the Fe<sub>3</sub>C/N,S-CNS-1.5 with more iron addition showed an increase on diffusion-limited currents, but a significant negative shift was observed in both the  $E_{\text{onset}}$  and  $E_{1/2}$ . This is due to the lower density of active sites caused by the low metal content, while the high metal content leads to excessive aggregation of metal ions, resulting in large particle size and low utilization of metal NPs, as seen from the respective histograms of nanoparticle-size distributions (Figure S3, Supporting Information), where the average diameter of metal NPs increases with the increasing iron addition. Accordingly, the Fe<sub>3</sub>C/N,S-CNS was selected for further studies because of its optimal performance with a moderate level of Fe contents. The ORR catalytic performance of the typical catalyst also outperforms those of many previous non-noble metal catalysts such as Fe/N-co doped carbon nanocages (Fe-NCCs,  $E_{1/2} = 0.82 \text{ V versus RHE}, E_{\text{onset}} = 0.93 \text{ V versus RHE},^{[26]}$  and N-doped vertical graphene (NVG)-30 ( $E_{1/2} = 0.80$  V versus RHE,  $E_{\rm onset} = 0.91$  V versus RHE)<sup>[27]</sup> (Table S1, Supporting Information).

Tafel slope is one of the important parameters used to investigate the reaction kinetics of advanced electrocatalysts. [28] The Tafel slope (Figure 4C) is 90.33 mV dec<sup>-1</sup> for Fe<sub>3</sub>C/N,S-CNS in the mixed control region, which is almost the lowest among the investigated catalysts, indicating the fastened ORR kinetics. This result is consistent with its highest  $E_{1/2}$  and current density in the above analysis.

LSV curves were recorded at different rotational rates (400–2500 rpm) to scrutinize the ORR kinetics of the Fe<sub>3</sub>C/N,S-CNS (Figure 4D). Notably, the limiting current density increases with the ascension of the rotation rates, which conforms to the first order dynamic equation. The average electron transfer number (*n*) is calculated to be 4.04 based on the Koutecky–Levich (K–L) plots (Inset in Figure 4D), indicating that the ORR follows a desirable four-electron (4 e<sup>-</sup>) reduction pathway on the asobtained catalyst. Interestingly, it reflects that O<sub>2</sub> is efficiently reduced to H<sub>2</sub>O on the Fe<sub>3</sub>C/N,S-CNS.<sup>[29]</sup> The 4 e<sup>-</sup> pathway is further confirmed by the rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) measurements (Figure S4A, Supporting Information), where

the  $H_2O_2$  yield is calculated to be 3.28% according to the ring current ( $I_{Ring}$ ) and disk current ( $I_{Disk}$ ), with an average electron transfer number (n) of 3.93 in the potential range of 0.2-0.8 V (Figure S4B, Supporting Information).

Also, as one of the important factors that significantly affects the ORR, electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) of the catalyst was assessed by the double-layer capacitance ( $C_{\rm dl}$ , Figure 4E) based on the acquired CV curves (Figure S5, Supporting Information). Specifically, the Fe<sub>3</sub>C/N,S-CNS exhibits a larger  $C_{\rm dl}$  value of 13.25 mF cm<sup>-2</sup> than the Fe<sub>3</sub>C/N,S-CNS-700 (0.93 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>) and Fe<sub>3</sub>C/N,S-CNS-900 (9.78 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>), implying the enlarged ECSA of the Fe<sub>3</sub>C/N,S-CNS. Meanwhile, the respective interfacial charge transfer kinetics was also analyzed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS, Figure S6, Supporting Information). Notably, the Fe<sub>3</sub>C/N,S-CNS catalyst has a smaller charge transfer resistance in the Nyquist plot than the controls, indicating the fastened electron transfer during the catalytic ORR process.

Apart from the excellent ORR performance, long-term stability of advanced catalysts is also an indicator hardly ignored. [30] As revealed in Figure 4F, the Fe<sub>3</sub>C/N,S-CNS catalyst exhibits the negligible  $E_{1/2}$  offset in the negative direction (only 9 mV), which is much smaller than Pt/C (20 mV, Figure S7, Supporting Information) under the similar condition, reflecting the remarkable stability. Besides, the chronoamperometric test was performed for 10 h to evaluate the stability (Figure 4G). The relative current density of the Fe<sub>3</sub>C/N,S-CNS remains 94.3% of its initial value, surpassing that of Pt/C (69.2%). These observations are mainly attributed to the unique sheet-like architectures and graphitic-carbon-coated Fe<sub>3</sub>C NPs, which ensure the fast interfacial charge transfer, coupled by effectively preventing the agglomeration and erosion of the embedded Fe<sub>3</sub>C.

Methanol resistance is also an important index to evaluate the applicability of advanced catalysts, because low methanol tolerance of Pt-based catalysts is a well-known drawback in various advanced cells (e.g., methanol fuel cells), so good methanol tolerance greatly extends the application scope of the ORR catalysts. [2,18] As depicted in Figure 4H, the reduction peak potential does not change significantly by comparing the respective CV plots before and after injection of 1.0 m methanol into the alkaline electrolyte. In a sharp contrast, the CV curves of the Pt/C change greatly before and after such methanol addition (Figure S8, Supporting Information). As well, there is almost invariable occurred in the chronoamperometric curves after the methanol injection, while sharp attenuation is noticed in the currents for the Pt/C (Figure 4I). These phenomena strongly confirm the stronger methanol resistance of the typical nano catalyst than Pt/C.

The excellent ORR performance of the Fe<sub>3</sub>C/N,S-CNS in the alkaline environment allows us to further explore its catalytic performance in 0.1  $\,^{\rm M}$  HClO<sub>4</sub> electrolyte. In general, the ORR catalysis is severely limited in the acid electrolyte over that in the alkaline environment. **Figure 5**A shows the respective LSV curves of the catalysts. As expected, the Fe<sub>3</sub>C/N,S-CNS catalyst shows the superior catalytic performance in an acidic environment with a  $E_{1/2}$  of 0.83 V and a  $E_{\rm onset}$  of 0.95 V, which are comparable to that of Pt/C, combined by outperforming those of the controls (Fe<sub>3</sub>C/N,S-CNS-900 with  $E_{\rm onset}$  of 0. 91 V and  $E_{1/2}$

of 0.78 V; Fe3C/N,S-CNS-700 with *E*onset of 0. 91 V and *E*1/2 of 0.74 V), as well as many nonnoble metal based electrocatalysts early reported such as Fe, Mn, and N-doped fish gill derived carbon (Fe,Mn,N-FGC, *E*1/2 = 0.73 V versus RHE, *E*onset = 0.92 V versus RHE)[31] and Fe, Mn-nitrogen-carbon (FeNC-900, *E*1/2 = 0.72 V versus RHE, *E*onset = 0.92 V versus RHE)[32] (Table S2, Supporting Information).

As found in Figure 5B, the Fe3C/N,S-CNS shows a smaller Tafel slope of 97.3 mV dec–1 than Pt/C (100.0 mV dec–1) in the acidic media. As shown in Figure 5C, the H2O2 yields and *n* are calculated based on the LSV curves measured on the RRDE with the values of 5.11% and 3.9 (Figure 5D), respectively, verifying that the ORR also follows a highly efficient 4 e− reduction pathway on the catalyst in acidic environment. Besides, the Fe3C/N,S-CNS also exhibits favorable long-term stability (Figure 5E), with a negative shift of 27 mV in the *E*1/2 after scanning for 2000 cycles. Also, the current attenuation of the Fe3C/N,S-CNS is only about 17.4% during the whole 10 h operating process by chronoamperometry (Figure 5F), while a larger attenuation in the current is found for Pt/C (57.8%). Based on the attenuation rate of the current, the Fe3C/N,S-CNS will work over twice as long as Pt/C. This implies that in practice, it can be operational for more than twice as long as Pt/C catalysts, which are already commercially available on a certain scale in new advanced batteries, reflecting the significant economic benefit. The ICP-OES assay was performed on the electrolyte after the long-term stability test to determine the metal dissolution of the catalyst. It is satisfactory that the iron concentration in the electrolyte is only 0.1 ppm, which can be regarded as almost no metal leaching. In the acidic media, carbon corrosion and metal loss (caused by demetallization) mainly account for the current attenuation.[33] The apposite graphitization of

the Fe<sub>3</sub>C/N,S-CNS can effectively improve the durability in the acidic electrolyte.[34]

Moreover, the surface morphology and chemical state of the catalysts were tested after the long-term stability testing. It is seen from Figure S9 (Supporting Information) that the carbon nanosheet-like structure of the Fe<sub>3</sub>C/N,S-CNS was still present without significant collapse. The XRD analysis demonstrated clear characteristic peaks of Fe<sub>3</sub>C (Figure S10, Supporting Information), which were highly resemble to those of precatalysis, indicating that the crystalline phase of metal NPs did not alter significantly. XPS analysis clearly reveals that the states of the Fe, C, N, and S elements in the catalysts after the long-term stability test (Figure S11, Supporting Information) have not altered significantly compared to the pretest states (Figure 3E-H), indicating that the metal NPs remain in their original chemical states and the carbon substrate has not been oxidized on a large scale. These results provide strong evidence for the excellent stability of the catalyst and its potential for large-scale practical applications.

In addition to the excellent ORR performance, the OER performance of the catalysts was also carefully investigated. As shown in the LSV curve (Figure S12A, Supporting Information), the overpotential of the Fe<sub>3</sub>C/N,S-CNS at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>  $(\eta_{10})$  is slightly higher than that of the noble metal-based catalyst (RuO<sub>2</sub>), but possesses a smaller Tafel slope (76.5 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>) than RuO<sub>2</sub> (77.8 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>, Figure S12B, Supporting Information), indicating its faster reaction kinetics. Further, according to the chronopotentiometric curves (Figure S12C, Supporting Information), the overpotential hardly increases significantly after 10 h testing, showing a better stability than RuO2. It also provides the basis for its satisfactory catalytic performance in Zn-Air battery.

#### 2.3. Application in Zn-Air Battery

By virtue of the significantly enhanced oxygen conversion features and long-term stability, the Fe<sub>3</sub>C/N,S-CNS was explored as the ORR cathode catalyst (modified on carbon paper) for assembling metal-air battery, where Zn plate acted as the anode. The assembled rechargeable Zn-air battery was examined in a 6.0 м KOH solution containing 0.2 M Zn(CH<sub>3</sub>COO)<sub>2</sub>. The respective open circuit voltage ( $V_{oc}$ ) is 1.427 V for the home-made Zn-air battery (Figure 6A). As shown in Figure 6B, two sets of Zn-air batteries are connected in series, which can effectively power a 3 V red light-emitting diode, demonstrating great potential of the as-prepared catalyst in practical applications.

Figure 6C shows the charge-discharge polarization curves. Obviously, the Fe<sub>3</sub>C/N,S-CNS based Zn-air battery has a smaller charge-discharge voltage gap (1.05 V at 50 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>) than the control group (Pt/C + RuO<sub>2</sub>, 1.23 V), exhibiting the promising rechargeable ability of the Fe<sub>3</sub>C/N,S-CNS. Besides, the peak power density is around 163 mW cm<sup>-2</sup> at 216 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> for the home-assembled battery (Figure 6D), showing the satisfactory discharge capacity.

What's more, the Fe<sub>3</sub>C/N,S-CNS based Zn-air battery exhibits excellent long-term cyclic stability (Figure 6E). Impressively, the voltage gap increases slightly from 0.881 to 0.901 V after the charge-discharge test by operating for 750 h at 5 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>.

durability of 200 h,[35] CoFe nanoalloy decorated N-doped hollow carbon microspheres (CoFe/N-HCSs) with a power density of 96.5 mW cm–2 and durability of 160 h[36] (Table S3, Supporting Information). Moreover, the Fe3C/N,S-CNS based Zn-air battery also maintains satisfactory stability of charging and discharging cycles with a high current density (50 mA cm–2), the voltage gap does not noticeably increase after 140 h of continuous operation (Figure S13, Supporting Information). These results fully reveal significantly improved stability of the assembled Zn-air battery, verifying its practical operability in this context.

### **2.4. DFT Simulation**

In order to further reveal the ORR mechanism and active center of Fe3C/N, S-CNS, a Fe3C nanocluster loaded on the N, S codoped carbon substrate was constructed for DFT calculations, containing nine Fe and three C atoms (**Figure 7**A,B). Based on the experimental results, the respective active sites can be divided into two main parts: The Fe3C clusters are predominant in the upper sites, while Fe–N and Fe–S species show up at the bottom sites. According to the Bader charge analysis,[37] Fe atoms donate more electrons to N and S atoms than blank C atoms, which conclude that the doped S and N atoms can effectively regulate the charge distributions around the Fe atom.

As the initial and essential step during the ORR process,[38] oxygen adsorption is first considered. Figures S14 and S15 (Supporting Information) exhibit the optimized structures and corresponding energies, combined by showing the optimal structures (Figure 7C,D). The absorbed O2 can be associative adsorption at the bottom sites, mainly on account of the fine regulation of the charge distributions around Fe by doping with S and N atoms (Figure S14, b-O2-5, Supporting Information). However, the DFT calculations reveal that O2 prefers to be dissociative adsorption at the upper two Fe atoms (Figure S15, u-O2-1, Supporting Information) with the largest adsorption energy (−6.27 versus −1.96 eV). Moreover, the electronical calculations (Figure 7C–F) also evidence that the absorbed O2 gains more electrons from the upper sites rather than the bottom counterpart (1.84 e− versus 0.84 e−). Thus, both the geometrical and electronical calculations provide solid evidences for extremely easy breakage of the absorbed O2 into \*O at the upper sites.

Furthermore, the Gibbs free energy calculations were applied to figure out the ORR mechanism on the upper and bottom sites. Figures S16–S20 (Supporting Information) exhibit all of the related intermediated species. Plainly, the associative mechanism is only considered at the bottom sites, where the absorbed O2 prefers to be dissociative adsorption. Taken together, the \*OH hydrogenation into H2O with 0.32 eV is the potential determining step (Figure 7G).

The dissociative mechanism is further investigated at both the upper and bottom sites, respectively. According to the Gibbs free-energy profiles (Figure 7H), the \*OH hydrogenation into H2O is the potential determining step at both the upper and bottom sites, in line with the associative mechanism. Meanwhile, the upper sites occupied with highly active Fe3C exhibit the better ORR performance than the bottom sites with a limiting potential of 0.32 V.

Based on the opinion that \*OH is very easily generated and adhered on the catalyst surface, the dissociation mechanism is also explored in the case of –OH groups. As revealed by the Gibbs free energy-profile (Figure 7I), the ORR occurs spontaneously at the Fe3C active center without any applied voltage (*U* = 0 V), while the bottom site still requires a limiting

potential of 0.87 V. Based on these DFT calculations, we can conclude that Fe3C is the most promising active center for the ORR whether the presence of -OH or not, and the -OH adhesion effectively improve the ORR performance.

## **3. Conclusions**

In summary, the Fe3C/N,S-CNS electrocatalyst was synthesized by one-pot pyrolysis treatment under the opposite pyrolysis temperature, where SFA demonstrated as an ideal complexing agent. Notably, the proper graphitized carbon ensures the maximum ECSA and effectively prevents the aggregation of the embedded Fe3C NPs. Further, the effective coating of the Fe3C particles with a thin graphite carbon layer also alleviates the carbon corrosion and metal loss, which is important for the ORR especially in the acidic environment. As expected, the Fe3C/N,S-CNS exhibits excellent catalytic activity under both alkaline (*E*onset = 0.98 V; *E*1/2 = 0.86 V) and acid (*E*onset = 0.94 V; *E*1/2 = 0.82 V) conditions. The DFT calculations definitely proved Fe3C as the main active center in the catalyst. The catalyst-assembled Zn-air battery displayed the ultrahigh power density (163 mW cm–2) and ultralong stability by successively operating for 750 h, showing a very broad application prospect in practice. This work provides some valuable insights for design and preparation of high-efficiency ORR catalyst in green energy storage and energy-conversion correlated devices.

# **4. Experimental Section**

*Synthesis of Fe*3*C/N,S-CNS*: For preparation of Fe3C/N,S-CNS, the typical process was described as follows. Briefly, 0.353 g (1 × 10−<sup>3</sup> m) of Fe(acac)3 and 0.4 g of SFA were dissolved into 50 mL of ethanol and kept stirring, followed by adding 1.0 g of g-C3N4. The homogeneous suspension was dried at 60 °C after continuously stirring for 1 h, and then thoroughly ground to form a uniform powder. Afterwards, the powder was further annealed at 500 °C for 2 h with a heating rate of 5 °C min–1 in N2 atmosphere, combined by heating up to 800 °C and remained for 2 h. The obtained product was soaked into a 0.5 m H2SO4 solution for 12 h, and thoroughly washed with water and ethanol successively, accompanied by vacuum drying at 60 °C for follow-up analysis.

For comparison, Fe3C/N,S-CNS-700 and Fe3C/N,S-CNS-900 were obtained by adjusting the final decomposition temperature to 700 °C/900 °C, Fe3C/N,S-CNS-0.5 and Fe3C/N,S-CNS-1.5 were obtained by www.advancedsciencenews.com

modulating the additional amount of Fe(acac)<sub>3</sub> to 0.177 g ( $0.5 \times 10^{-3}$  M)/  $0.530 \text{ g} (1.5 \times 10^{-3} \text{ m})$ , while the other synthetic conditions remained constant if not specifically stated.

DFT Calculations: All of the DFT calculations were implemented by the Vienna ab-initio Simulation Package (VASP)[39] with the Perdew, Burke, Ernzerhof (PBE) functional of generalized gradient approximation (GGA).<sup>[40]</sup> Besides, Projector Augmented Wave (PAW) method<sup>[41]</sup> with the cutoff energy of 450 eV was applied to describe the valence electron density. The convergence threshold was set as  $10^{-5}$  eV in energy and  $10^{-2}$  eV Å<sup>-1</sup> in force. The Brillouin zone<sup>[42]</sup> was sampled as  $3 \times 3 \times 1$ . More than 15 Å vacuum space was set to avoid interactions between the periodic images. The van der Waals (vdW) interactions were described by the DFT-D3 method.[43]

The adsorption energies  $(E_{ad})$  were calculated by the sequential equation:

$$E_{\rm ad} = E_{\rm adsorb} - (E_{\rm catal} + E_{\rm mol}) \tag{1}$$

where the  $E_{adsorb}$ ,  $E_{catal}$ , and  $E_{mol}$  represent the total energies of a catalyst after adsorption, pristine catalyst, and the adsorbate molecule,

The Gibbs free energies calculation method<sup>[38c,44]</sup> was adopted based on standard hydrogen electrode:

$$\Delta G = \Delta E_{\text{DFT}} + \Delta Z P E + \Delta H - T \times \Delta S + \Delta G_{\text{pH}} + \Delta G_{\text{u}}$$
 (2)

where E represents the total energy obtained from DFT calculation, ZPE, H, and S are the zero-point energy, heat capacity, and entropy, respectively.

$$\Delta G_{u} = -n \times e \times U \tag{3}$$

where n is the transferred electron number.

$$\Delta G_{\text{pH}} = -k_{\text{B}} \times T \times \ln[H^{+}] = -k_{\text{B}} \times T \times \text{pH} \times \ln 10 \tag{4}$$

where  $k_{\rm B}$  is the Boltzmann constant. In this work, T is set as 298.15 K and pH = 0.

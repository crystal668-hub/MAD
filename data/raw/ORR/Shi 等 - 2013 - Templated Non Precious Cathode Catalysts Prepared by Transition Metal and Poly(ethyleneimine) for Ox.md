The present paper is devoted to preparation and characterization of catalyst for oxygen reduction reactrion (ORR) based on pyrolyzed metal-poly(ethyleneimine)(namely M-PEI, M=Co, Fe, Ce). Template method was applied to obtain catalyst with high surface area and porosity. Results of electrochemical characterization, which was performed using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) employing a rotating disk electrode (RDE), with emphasis on the activity of the catalyst are presented. The catalytic activity was found to depend strongly on the kind of transition metal and anion species. The relation of eletrocatalytic activity varies as follows: Co > Fe > Ce for transition metals and, nitrate > sulfate for anion species. Co-PEI, with onset potential at 0.1V, half-wave potential at 0V and average transferred electron number at 3.3, was found to show the highest ORR activity among the catalysts studied.

#### Introduction

With the energy crisis continues, fuel cell (FC) has been considered as promising energy conversion way for its high economic and energy efficiency. Pt, the most commonly used catalyst, hinders the mass commercialization of FC for its high cost and scarcity. Non precious metal (NPM) catalysts, which are cheap and abundant, have been reported as alternative candidates of replacing Pt for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in polymer electrolyte membrane FC. Certain types of N-containing transition metal catalysts have shown remarkable activity for oxygen reduction in alkaline electrolyte, especially for Fe- and Co- centered catalysts<sup>1-3</sup>. However, compared to Pt-based catalysts for practical application in fuel cell technology, both the ORR activity and stability of these catalysts have to be significantly improved<sup>4,5</sup>.

It is believed that the high surface area, high porosity and proper pore structure of

catalyst usually lead to high catalytic activity for the ORR. Template method has drawn great attention for obtaining the specified morphology and predetermined microstructure6,7. In this paper, we choose template method to synthetize NPM catalysts with high surface area, porosity and density of active sites. In this work, the nanoscale SiO2 was employed as sacrificial supports to create pores, while poly(ethyleneimine) (PEI) as sources of N and C, transition metal as metal sources. The resultant highly porous M-PEI catalysts were characterized with cyclic voltammetry (CV), linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) by employing rotating disk electrode(RDE) to evaluate the activity of ORR. In particular, emphasis is made on the metal and the anion species effect.

#### **Experimental**

#### Catalyst preparation

The M-PEI (M = Co, Fe, Ce, M/PEI = 1/3) catalyst was prepared by homogeneously dispersion of metal and PEI (Sigma–Aldrich, the molecular weights (MW): 2000) precursors onto the surface of SiO2(Hangzhou Wanjing New Material Co., Ltd, 30 ± 5nm). After sonicated for 8h to mix sufficiently and dried at 85◦C overnight to remove water, the resulting solid was grounded to fine powder. The powder was then heat-treated at 800◦C for 1h under a nitrogen atmosphere with temperature ramp rates of 20◦C/min. Finally, the SiO2 was vacated by means of excess amount of 40 wt.% of HF for 24h. The final powder was washed to be neutral by purified water and then dried overnight. Base on this method, a series of M-PEI catalysts with high porosity was prepared. To investigate the effect of metal species, cobalt nitrate hexahydrate (Co(NO3)26H2O) , iron nitrate nonahydrate (Fe(NO3)<sup>3</sup> 9H2O) and cerium nitrate hexahydrate (Ce(NO3)36H2O) were used as metal-precursors. In addition, Cobalt sulfate hepathydrate (CoSO47H2O) was employed (abbreviated as CoSO4-PEI) to compare with Co-PEI to research the effect of the anion species.

#### Electrochemical testing

For working electrode preparation, 4 milligram of M-PEI catalyst was suspended in 2mL of isopropyl alcohol (Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd) to prepare the catalyst ink. Then 5uL of ink was applied onto a clean glassy carbon (GC) disk with a sectional area of 0.2475cm<sup>2</sup> four times. After air-drying, one drop of methanol/Nafion® solution (50:1 in mass) was deposited onto the surface of the catalyst and left to dry at room temperature. The overall loading of the mixed catalyst was 16g/cm<sup>2</sup> . Therefore, the current densities reported here are all using the geometric area of the carbon electrode.

To investigate the electrocatalytic activity of the M-PEI catalysts, CV, LSV and RDE measurements were performed using a CHI Electrochemical Station (Model 750b) and a conventional three electrode cell filled with 0.1 M KOH electrolyte saturated in O2 at room temperature. A platinum wire counter electrode and a saturated calomel reference electrode were used. All potentials in this work were referred to standard hydrogen electrode (SHE). The measurements were carried out using RDE (Pine 5908 Triangle Drive Raleigh, NC21617) by CV at 50 mV s−1 and LSV at 5 mV s-1 and, at a rotation speed of 300, 600, 1200, 1800, 2400 rpm, respectively, to determine the current density at room temperature in O2 streams.

### **Results and Discussion**

Figure 1 Cyclic voltammograms of M (M=Fe, Co, Ce)-PEI in O2-saturated 0.1M KOH; Scan rate: 50 mV s-1. The overall loading of the mixed catalyst was 162g cm-2 .

#### Cyclic voltammetry

Figure 1 shows the cyclic voltammograms of Fe-PEI, Co-PEI and Ce-PEI catalysts, respectively. It can be seen that Co-PEI catalysts showed much better ORR activities than that of Fe-PEI and Ce-PEI catalyst. Although the ORR peak potentials of Co-PEI (-0.02 mV) and Fe-PEI (-0.054 mV) electrodes were similar, the peak current density on Co-PEI electrode is 200% higher than that on Fe-PEI electrode. Both are much higher than that of Ce-PEI catalyst based on their peak potential and peak current densities. Since almost all of the transition metals can be removed by HF, the difference in ORR performances on these catalysts was probably due to fact that the role transition metal played in promoting the formation of active sites, instead of forming active sites themselves.

#### RDE measurements

In order to investigate the characteristics of the electrocatalytic activity for the ORR, LSV was carried out in oxygen-saturated 0.1M KOH solution by rotating disk electrode. Figure 2 shows the polarization curves of the above three electrodes. Clearly, Co-PEI was found to show the highest ORR activity among the catalysts studied and follows the order: Co > Fe > Ce. The onset potential at 0.1V and the half-wave potential at 0V were obtained for Co-PEI catalyst. The ORR half-wave potential of Co-PEI catalyst is positively shifted by 60 mV and 180 mV compared to that of Fe-PEI and Ce-PEI catalysts, respectively. Besides, the Co-PEI showed better-defined diffusion-limiting current plateau. This suggests that the distribution of active sites on Co-PEI electrode is more uniform and, the oxygen reduction reaction rate is much faster than those on Ce-PEI electrode and Fe-PEI electrode.

Figure 2 Polarization curves of M-PEI (M=Fe, Co, Ce) catalysts in  $O_2$ -saturated 0.1M KOH solution. Potential scan rate: 5mV/s. Electrode rotation rate: 1500rpm. The overall loading of the mixed catalyst was  $162\mu\text{g cm}^{-2}$ .

Based on the data of RDE measurements from 300 to 2400 rpm (Fig 3), Koutecky–Levich plots can be expressed with the following equations:

$$\frac{1}{j_d} = \frac{1}{j_k} + \frac{1}{j_f} + \frac{1}{j_l} \tag{1}$$

where  $j_k$  is the ORR kinetic current density,  $j_f$  is the O<sub>2</sub> diffusion current density through the ionomer in the electrode coating layer, and  $j_l$  is the limiting current density induced by O<sub>2</sub> diffusion from solution through catalyst layer. Our calculation based on the ionomer used in the catalyst layer showed that this  $j_f$  is much higher than both those  $j_d$  and  $j_k$ , therefore, its reciprocal can be negligible. In this case, Equation (1) can be simplified to:

$$\frac{1}{j_d} = \frac{1}{j_k} + \frac{1}{j_l} \tag{2}$$

The  $j_l$  can be expressed as:

$$j_l = 0.2nFC_{o_2}D_{o_2}^{2/3}\gamma^{-1/6}\omega^{1/2}$$
 (3)

where  $\omega$  is the electrode rotation rate (rpm), n the overall electron transfer number, F the Faraday constant,  $C_0$  is the bulk concentration of dissolved oxygen,  $D_0$ 

the diffusion coefficient of oxygen in the solution,  $\nu$  the kinematic viscosity of the 0.1M KOH.

The inset in Figure 3 shows the Koutecky-Levich plots of Co-PEI catalyst at -0.4, -0.35, -0.3, -0.25, -0.2, -0.15 and -0.1 V, respectively. By calculating the slopes of the Koutecky-Levich plots, n value of 3.14, 3.19, 3.24, 3.29, 3.34, 3.38 and 3.41 were obtained for the Co-PEI catalyst, respectively. That is, the values of n for oxygen reduction depend on the high negative overpotentials, with an average value of 3.3. This indicates that the mixed 2e- and 4e- transfer process took place and the reduction of  $O_2$  produces both  $HO_2^-$  and  $OH^-$  in the final product in Co-PEI catalyst electrode, but at more negative potentials, the latter is dominant.

Figure 3 Current-voltage curves of a glass carbon disk electrode (0.2475 cm²) coated by Co-PEI, recorded at different electrode rotating rates from 300 to 2400 rpm in O<sub>2</sub>-saturated 0.1 M KOH solution at room temperature. Potential scan rate: 5 mV/s, and catalyst loading: 162μg/cm² (Insert: Koutecky–Levich plots at different electrode potential).

Figure 4 Koutecky–Levich plots and number of electrons transfer involved in per oxygen molecule at -0.35V for Co-PEI, Fe-PEI and Ce-PEI electrodes. Other conditions are the same as in Figure 3.

Figure 4 shows the Koutecky-Levich plots for the Co-PEI, Fe-PEI and Ce-PEI electrodes at -0.35 V in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte, in which also includes the electron transfer number calculated for each catalyst. For a better comparison, the theoretical plots for the 2-electron and 4-electron transfer processes of the ORR are also shown in Figure 4. According to the slopes of these plots measured under the same experiment conditions, the obtained overall ORR electron transfer numbers for Co-PEI, Fe-PEI, Ce-PEI are 3.38, 2.84 and 2.62, respectively, suggesting that the Co-PEI has the most overall ORR electron number.

#### Anion species effect

In order to investigate the electro-catalytic effect due to the anion species of metallic salts, cobalt sulfate hepathydrate (CoSO47H2O) was employed as metal precursor (expressed as CoSO4-PEI) to compare with Co-PEI (Co(NO3)26H2O was used as metal source).

|-----------|------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Co-PEI    | -60        | 3.3                                        | 3.9                                                     | 0.1                       | 0                             |
| CoSO4-PEI | -55        | 1.7                                        | 2.2                                                     | 0.1                       | 0                             |

<sup>\*</sup>Diffusion limiting current density, onset-potential, half-wave potential, measured at 1500 r/min.

As summarized in Table 1, it can be seen that both the peak current density and diffusion limiting current density of Co-PEI electrode are much higher than that on CoSO4-PEI electrode, although they have similar ORR peak potentials (about -60 mV) , onset potential (0.1V) and half-wave potential (0V). This may due to that nitrate can provide more C-N or M-N active sites to enhance the electrocatalytic activity. Additional experiments are needed to determining the nature of active sites.

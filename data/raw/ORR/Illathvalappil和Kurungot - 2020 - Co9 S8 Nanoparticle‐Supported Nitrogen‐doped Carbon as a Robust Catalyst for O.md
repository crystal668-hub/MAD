**Abstract:** The present work illustrates the synthesis of an efficient and durable catalyst for electrochemical Oxygen Reduction Reaction (ORR) which is active both in the alkaline and acidic conditions by dispersing few-layer graphitic carbon coated Co9S<sup>8</sup> nanoparticles on the nitrogen-doped carbon (NVC-G) support (Co9S8/NVC-G). The size of the Co9S<sup>8</sup> nanoparticles is nearly 7-8 nm and the particles are found to be dispersed homogeneously on the NVC-G support. The few-layer graphitic carbon formed on the surface of Co9S<sup>8</sup> nanoparticles is assisting to accomplish their small size and it also prevents agglomeration of the nanoparticles. The ORR activity of the obtained material was analyzed in both 0.1 M KOH and 0.5 M H2SO<sup>4</sup> solutions. Co9S8/NVC-G displays nearly 70 mV overpotential compared to the *state-of-the-art* Pt/C in 0.1 M KOH solution. The half-wave potential (E1/2) difference of the present system is nearly 75 mV with the commercial Pt/C. Co9S8/NVC-G displays promising ORR activity in the acidic conditions as well with nearly 140 mV overpotential compared to its Pt/C counterpart. The system shows about 170 mV lower E1/2 value with Pt/C. The system shows good stability both in acidic and basic conditions compared to the Pt/C system. Finally, testing of a single cell of a polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) was performed by employing Co9S8/NVC-G as the cathode catalyst and Nafion-212 as the proton exchange membrane. The system displays a maximum power density of 245 mW cm-2 in H2-O<sup>2</sup> and 115 mW cm-2 in H2-air feeding conditions.

#### **Introduction**

The increasing energy demand along with alarms of environmental pollution and fossil fuel depletion has forced the society to explore sustainable clean energy sources and technologies.[1, 2] The carbon emission-free power sources are receiving wide attention due to their eco-friendly and environmentally benign nature.[3] Compared to the fossil fuel based energy sources, hydrogen (H2) is having high specific energy (142 MJ/kg) and is vital for employing as an alternate fuel owing to its carbon-neutral nature.[4] The polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) is important in this circumstance due to its high theoretical energy and power densities, high efficiency, low operating temperature and zero-emission of greenhouse gases for the conversion of H<sup>2</sup> into electrical energy.[5, 6] Hence, PEMFCs can be widely employed as a promising clean power technology for the stationary as well as portable applications.[7, 8] However, the sluggish kinetics of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on the cathode results in the energy loss and this acts as the bottleneck for accomplishing enhanced fuel cell performance.[9] Therefore, to facilitate the reactions in PEMFCs, Pt supported carbon based catalysts are being employed on the electrodes.[10] The hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) on the anode is faster and, therefore, it requires a relatively lower amount of Pt catalyst.[7] On the other hand, a reasonably higher amount of the Pt-based catalyst is required on the cathode for aiding ORR.[11]

Even though the Pt-based catalysts are displaying better ORR activity, the commercialization potential of PEMFCs is restricted mainly due to the issues like high cost, scarcity, low methanol tolerance and poor stability of the Pt catalysts.[6, 12] To address these issues of the Pt catalysts, various approaches have been adopted. These include the development of Pt-alloys with controlled architectures, core-shell morphologies of Pt with transition metals and, noble-metal-free ORR catalysts.[13-17] Among them, the noble-metal-free ORR catalysts are receiving substantial attention due to their low cost, improved activity, high methanol tolerance and, better stability.[18] The noble-metal-free ORR catalysts are generally comprised of metal oxide, sulfide, nitride, *etc*., supported on various carbon substrates.[19] The metal oxide-based catalysts are reported to be displaying enhanced ORR activity and stability in the alkaline conditions. However, relatively poor stability of many metal oxides in the acidic environment restricts their wide utilization for this application.[20, 21] Hence, for accomplishing the large-scale commercialization of PEMFCs cost-effectively, concurrent development of the low cost, stable and efficient ORR catalysts in both acidic and alkaline conditions is essential. In this perspective, the application of metal sulfide based catalysts is appropriate due to their noticeable ORR activity and excellent oxidative stability in the corrosive atmosphere.[22, 24] Among the various metal sulfides, Co9S<sup>8</sup> based catalysts are having paramount interest due to their variable oxidation states, higher catalytic activity and, stability.[23, 25-27] Though most of the reported Co9S<sup>8</sup> based systems are displaying ORR activity in the alkaline medium, the performance is still

**Scheme 1**. Schematic illustration of the synthesis of Co9S8/NVC-G by following the two-step process; the hydrothermal route followed by heat treatment of the material at 900 °C for 1 h in an inert atmosphere lead to Co9S8/NVC-G. The application of the material was demonstrated by employing Co9S8/NVC-G as the cathode catalyst in PEMFC for facilitating ORR.

lacking in the acidic conditions.[27-29] Besides, literature reports indicate that supported Co9S<sup>8</sup> based systems are displaying improved catalytic activity due to the synergetic interactions and, the extended dispersion of the nanoparticles.[27, 28, 30] Liu *et al*. developed a process for the scalable synthesis of Co9S<sup>8</sup> nanoparticles on nitrogen-doped hollow carbon spheres and the system displays excellent ORR activity due to the synergetic interactions. [63] Therefore, rational designing of the supported Co9S<sup>8</sup> based systems is certainly desirable to exhibit the ORR activity in both acidic and alkaline conditions and, for further developing the Pt-free cathodes for PEMFCs.[31, 32]

The typical carbon substrates used for supporting the nanomaterials are carbon nanotube (CNT), Vulcan carbon, heteroatom doped graphene, carbon nanofiber (CNF) *etc*. [17, 33] The carbon support plays an important role in achieving the proper dispersion of the nanomaterials and, subsequently in delivering enhanced fuel cell performance. Also, the mass transport of the reactant gases is greatly promoted by the microstructures of the carbon support with concomitant improvement in the activity. [64, 65] The corrosion resistance, porosity, electrical conductivity *etc*., of the carbon greatly influence the system efficiency.[34] Due to the low cost, high surface area and better electrical conductivity, Vulcan carbon is considered as a promising substrate for anchoring the nanomaterials.[35] However, the poor stability of Vulcan carbon in the oxidative environment causes agglomeration of the supported nanoparticles during the long-term operation and this reduces the catalyst efficiency.[32, 33] It has been recognized that heteroatom doping on carbon would improve the stability of the matrix and modulates the electronic structure and adsorption energies for O2. [36, 37] Also, heteroatom doping would assist for the uniform nucleation of nanoparticles and enhancement of the active site density.[38] Hence, for achieving improved ORR activity and stability, supporting the nanoparticles on the heteroatom-doped carbon is essential.[66-68] Typically, the nanoparticle deposition on Vulcan carbon can lead to the dispersion of the particles both on the surface as well as inside the micropores of carbon. The nanoparticles present in the micropores of Vulcan carbon are generally inactive towards ORR due to the ineffective formation of the "triple-phase-boundary" with the ionomer and reactant gases.[39] Hence, to improve the utilization of the nanoparticles, the extent of micropores in the Vulcan carbon has to be reduced. Literature reports are existing for the production of glucosederived carbon through the hydrothermal carbonization process,[34] which offers an opportunity of filling the micropores of Vulcan carbon with the glucose-derived carbon. This would eventually improve the utilization of the nanoparticles by their controlled dispersion on the carbon surface rather than in the micropores. Considering this advantage, in the present work, the Vulcan carbon-glucose combination was used in the hydrothermal system for producing the carbon support. Concurrently, nitrogen doping and nanoparticle growth occur during the hydrothermal treatment. The hydrothermal process is followed by acid washing and heat-treatment of the obtained material in an inert atmosphere to get the Co9S<sup>8</sup> nanoparticlesupported nitrogen-doped carbon (Co9S8/NVC-G) (Scheme 1). The ORR activity of Co9S8/NVC-G was investigated in both alkaline and acidic conditions. Finally, the single cell analysis of PEMFC was performed by employing Co9S8/NVC-G as the cathode catalyst and Nafion-212 as the proton exchange membrane.

#### **Results and Discussion**

The morphological characteristics of the synthesized materials were examined by TEM and FESEM analyses. The TEM images of Co9S8/NVC-G is presented in Figure 1. The dispersion of Co9S<sup>8</sup> nanoparticles on the nitrogen-doped carbon surface is confirmed

**Figure 1.** (a) TEM image of Co9S8/NVC-G indicating the homogenous distribution of the Co9S<sup>8</sup> nanoparticles on NVC-G, (b) high magnification image of the marked portion in image (a) and the inset represents the SAED pattern, (c) high magnification image of the Co9S<sup>8</sup> nanoparticle in Co9S8/NVC-G with the arrow marks indicating the few-layer graphitic carbon coating on the Co9S<sup>8</sup> nanoparticle surface, (d) particle size distribution analysis of Co9S8/NVC-G, and (e) TEM-EDX elemental mapping showing the uniform distribution of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, cobalt, and sulfur in Co9S8/NVC-G.

from Figure 1a. The high magnification image of the marked portion in Figure 1a is provided as Figure 1b, which illustrates the uniform dispersion of the Co9S<sup>8</sup> nanoparticles on the NVC-G support. This could be accomplished due to the nitrogen doping on carbon, which provides the proper interaction of Co9S<sup>8</sup> nanoparticles with the NVC-G support. The SAED pattern presented in the inset of Figure 1b confirms the crystalline nature of Co9S8/NVC-G. Figure 1c presents the high magnification image of the Co9S<sup>8</sup> nanoparticles, which indicates the presence of the few-layer surface coating of the graphitic carbon on the Co9S<sup>8</sup> nanoparticle. The yellow arrow marks in Figure 1c point towards the carbon coating formed on the surface of the Co9S<sup>8</sup> nanoparticles. From this, it can be elucidated that the number of surface carbon layers on the Co9S<sup>8</sup> nanoparticles is less than 10. The small size of the Co9S<sup>8</sup> nanoparticle is achieved due to the formation of a thin carbon layer on the nanoparticle surface, which in turn is derived from glucose during the hydrothermal treatment. This would prevent the further growth and agglomeration of the Co9S<sup>8</sup> nanoparticles. The d-spacing value of Co9S<sup>8</sup> is calculated from Figure 1c and is about 0.29 nm, which is assigned to the (311) lattice plane of Co9S8. [24, 28] The d-spacing value of the surface coating of Co9S<sup>8</sup> is calculated and is nearly 0.34 nm, corresponds to the (002) lattice plane of the graphitic carbon.[41, 42] The histogram provided in Figure 1d designates that the asformed Co9S<sup>8</sup> nanoparticles are around 7-8 nm in size in Co9S8/NVC-G. Figure 1e illustrates the TEM-EDX elemental mapping of Co9S8/NVC-G and confirms the uniform distribution of carbon, nitrogen, cobalt, and sulfur in the system. The TEM images of NVC-G is provided in Figure S1. The fused spherical morphology of NVC-G is confirmed from the TEM images (Figure S1a-b). It is clear from the figure that, there is no separate carbon sheet/agglomerate present in NVC-G. This further validates that after the hydrothermal treatment, the glucose derived carbon is well incorporated with the Vulcan carbon and also on the surface of Co9S<sup>8</sup> nanoparticles.

To understand the role played by the carbon support for obtaining the uniformly distributed Co9S<sup>8</sup> nanoparticles, few control samples were prepared (explained in the Experimental Section). The TEM images of the material synthesized in the absence of glucose (Co9S8/NVC) are presented in Figure S2. It is observed from Figure S2 that, in the absence of glucose during the reaction, the size of the formed Co9S<sup>8</sup> nanoparticles is above 100 nm. This could be attributed that, in the absence of the glucose-derived carbon layer on the nanoparticle surface, they are undergoing coalescence with the neighbouring particles. This would result in the formation of the Co9S<sup>8</sup> nanoparticles with a larger size. The material prepared in the absence of fn-VC is named as Co9S8/NC-G and the corresponding TEM images are provided in Figure S3. In the absence of fn-VC, the Co9S<sup>8</sup> nanoparticles seem to be agglomerated as evident from Figure S3a-d. This could be ascribed to the lack of proper anchoring sites for the cobalt ions before the hydrothermal synthesis. This would result in the random growth of the nanoparticles during the synthesis and finally leading to the formation of agglomerated Co9S<sup>8</sup> nanoparticles. The material prepared in the absence of ammonia is termed as Co9S8/VC-G and the corresponding TEM images are illustrated in Figure S4. It is clear from Figure S4a-d that, the Co9S<sup>8</sup> nanoparticles having the size in the range of 50-

**Figure 2.** (a) XRD profile comparison of the synthesized materials along with the standard JCPDS pattern of Co9S<sup>8</sup> and, (b) TGA profiles of Co9S8/NVC-G and NVC-G performed in O<sup>2</sup> atmosphere from room temperature to 900 °C with a heating rate of 10 min-1

60 nm are formed in the absence of ammonia, and they are randomly distributed on the carbon support. Figure S4 confirms the formation of the surface carbon layer on the Co9S<sup>8</sup> nanoparticles, which is indicated with the arrow marks. Even though the particle size is reduced due to the formation of the surface carbon layer on Co9S8, the dispersion of the Co9S<sup>8</sup> nanoparticles seems to be poor. This specifies the significance of nitrogen doping in accomplishing the uniformly distributed Co9S<sup>8</sup> nanoparticles on the carbon support. Further, nitrogen doping would induce the proper interaction of Co9S<sup>8</sup> nanoparticles with the support and thus helps to provide enhanced stability in the system. Hence, it can be concluded that, in order to obtain the homogeneously distributed Co9S<sup>8</sup> nanoparticles with smaller size on the carbon support, along with cobalt chloride and thiourea, the simultaneous presence of fn-VC, glucose, and ammonia in the reaction mixture is indeed essential.

The FESEM images of NVC-G are presented in Figure S5. The images clearly specify the porous morphology of the nitrogendoped carbon (NVC-G). From Figure S5a-d, the absence of discrete carbon sheet/agglomerate in the system confirms that the glucose-derived carbon is integrated with the Vulcan carbon. This further validates the results obtained from the TEM analysis. Figure S6 shows the FESEM images of Co9S8/NVC-G recorded at different magnifications. Figure S6d displays the porous morphology of Co9S8/NVC-G and is indicated with the arrow marks. Due to the ultra-small size of Co9S<sup>8</sup> nanoparticles, such particles are not evident in the FESEM images. The SEM-EDX elemental mapping of Co9S8/NVC-G is presented in Figure S7. The homogenous distribution of carbon, nitrogen, cobalt, and sulfur in Co9S8/NVC-G is evident from the EDX elemental mapping (Figure S7). The minute amount of oxygen detected during the elemental mapping could be originated from the adsorbed surface oxygen during the sample preparation.

The composition and phase of the synthesized materials were examined by XRD. Figure 2a represents the XRD profile of Co9S8/NVC-G in comparison with the other synthesized materials and the standard JCPDS pattern of Co9S<sup>8</sup> is provided for reference. The XRD spectrum of Co9S8/NVC-G displays sharp peaks at 15.2°, 29.6°, 31.1°, 39.4°, 47.4°, 51.9°, and 73.2°, corresponding to the (111), (311), (222), (331), (511), (440) and (731) lattice planes of Co9S8, respectively. [43] This confirms the formation of the Co9S<sup>8</sup> phase in Co9S8/NVC-G. The sharp peaks of the Co9S<sup>8</sup> phase in Co9S8/NVC-G designate the crystalline nature of the as-formed material. The XRD spectra of Co9S8/VC-G, Co9S8/NVC and, Co9S8/NC-G are also exhibiting the peaks correspond to Co9S8. The peaks appeared at 36.6° and 42.5° in Co9S8/VC-G is corresponding to the (111) and (200) lattice planes of CoO, respectively.[69] The CoO could be formed as an impurity phase along with the major phases of Co9S<sup>8</sup> in Co9S8/VC-G. The peaks at 25.2° and 43.3° in NVC-G are corresponding to the (002) and (110) lattice planes of carbon, respectively.[44, 45] In Co9S8/NVC-G, after anchoring the Co9S<sup>8</sup> nanoparticles, the intensity corresponds to the (002) plane of carbon is reduced. This confirms the dispersion of Co9S<sup>8</sup> nanoparticles on the nitrogendoped carbon surface. The XRD spectra recorded before and after the heat-treatment of the material at 900 °C is provided in Figure S8. The presence of the mixed phases of CoS and Co9S<sup>8</sup> on NVC-G support before heat-treatment of the system is evident from Figure S8. Also, after the heat-treatment at 900 °C in an inert atmosphere, the conversion of CoS into the Co9S<sup>8</sup> phase is confirmed and leads to the formation of Co9S8/NVC-G. This could be ascribed that at high temperature, sulfur atoms would leave from the system and eventually the system transforms from the stoichiometric composition (CoS) to a non-stoichiometric composition (Co9S8).[46] To evaluate the thermal stability and weight percentage of Co9S<sup>8</sup> in Co9S8/NVC-G, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed in O<sup>2</sup> atmosphere from room temperature to 900 °C with a ramp rate of 10 °C min-1 . Figure 2b illustrates the TGA profile of Co9S8/NVC-G in comparison with NVC-G. The sharp weight reduction in NVC-G at ~410 °C is due to the oxidation of carbon into CO2. The weight loss occurred below 100 °C in Co9S8/NVC-G is due to the removal of the adsorbed water molecules. Co9S8/NVC-G shows stability up to 350 °C and a major weight loss observed after 350 °C is due to the oxidation of carbon and the conversion of Co9S<sup>8</sup> into Co3O4. [43] The weight percentage of Co9S<sup>8</sup> in Co9S8/NVC-G is calculated from TGA and is found to be nearly 20 %.

Raman spectroscopy was performed to analyze the extent of defects in the carbon present in the system. Figure 3a presents the comparative Raman spectra of the as synthesized materials. Co9S8/NVC-G displays the peaks at 463.5 and 671.1 cm-1 correspond to the vibrational modes of Co9S8, respectively.[43, 47- <sup>48</sup> In addition to the peaks of Co9S8, the synthesized materials display the D and G-band corresponding to the carbon. The Dband is arising due to the structural disorder (A1g-mode) and the G-band is due to the 2E2g vibrational mode of the carbon. [30, 49] The D and G-band of fn-VC are appeared at 1318 and 1584 cm-1 , respectively. However, a shift towards the higher wavenumber is observed for Co9S8/NVC-G and the corresponding values of D and G-band are 1338 and 1594 cm-1 , respectively. This is due to the inclusion of nitrogen on the carbon framework, which induces the compressive stress on the carbon in Co9S8/NVC-G. [50] Figure 3b illustrates the comparative ID/I<sup>G</sup> values of fn-VC, NVC-G, Co9S8/VC-G, Co9S8/NVC-G, Co9S8/NVC and, Co9S8/NC-G. The corresponding ID/I<sup>G</sup> values are 1.32, 1.19, 1.19, 1.25, 1.26 and 1.19, respectively. The lower ID/I<sup>G</sup> values of the synthesized materials indicate that, as compared to fn-VC, the degree of graphitization is improved in the synthesized materials. This could be attributed to the improved graphitization achieved after heattreatment of the material at 900 °C in the inert atmosphere. This would result in the reduction of the ID/I<sup>G</sup> values compared to fn-VC. The slightly higher ID/I<sup>G</sup> value in Co9S8/NVC-G compared to the other synthesized materials designates that more amount of nitrogen is incorporated on the carbon framework in Co9S8/NVC-G compared to the other synthesized materials during the course of the reaction. The presence of the small peak at 1766 cm-1 in C9S8/NC-G is attributed to the C=O stretching vibrations.[71, 72] This could be originated from the small amount of carbonyl group present in the glucose derived carbon in C9S8/NC-G.

The Brunauer-Emmet-Teller (BET) method was used to analyze the surface area and pore-size distribution of the synthesized materials. The adsorption/desorption status of the gas at relative pressure on the sample surface is measured to determine the surface area of the material. From Figure 3c, it is deduced that the surface area of fn-VC is 191 m<sup>2</sup> g -1 and the corresponding value of Co9S8/NVC-G is 120 m<sup>2</sup> g -1 . Compared to fn-VC, the drop in the surface area of Co9S8/NVC-G could be attributed to the presence of Co9S<sup>8</sup> nanoparticles on the surface of NVC-G. The degree of micropores present in Co9S8/NVC-G is found to be reduced as compared to that in fn-VC (Figure 3d). This is due to the formation of glucose-derived carbon on the micropores of fn-VC during the hydrothermal treatment.

The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was performed to understand the electronic states of the elements and the composition of the obtained material. Figure 4 represents the XPS spectra of the as-prepared materials. Figure 4a illustrates the comparative survey spectra of NVC-G and Co9S8/NVC-G. The survey spectrum confirms the presence of carbon, nitrogen, cobalt, and sulfur in Co9S8/NVC-G. The deconvoluted N 1s

spectra of NVC-G is illustrated in Figure 4b. The spectra indicate the three kinds of nitrogen in NVC-G. The peaks appeared at 399.4, 400.6 and 401.7 eV correspond to the pyrrolic-N (N1), graphitic-N (N2) and quaternary-N (N3) present in NVC-G, respectively.[51] The deconvoluted C 1s spectra of Co9S8/NVC-G is shown in Figure 4c. The peak present at 284.5 eV corresponds to the sp<sup>2</sup> hybridized carbon. [52, 53] The peak appeared at 285.4 eV is characteristic of the C-N interactions in Co9S8/NVC-G.[43, 54] In agreement with this, the deconvoluted N 1s spectra of Co9S8/NVC-G display the five types of nitrogen (Figure 4d). The peaks present at 398.6, 399.4, 400.9, 402.2 and 403.7 eV correspond to the pyridinic-N (N1), pyrrolic-N (N2), graphitic-N (N3), quaternary-N (N4) and pyridinic N-oxide (N5) present in Co9S8/NVC-G, respectively.[51] The atomic percentage of nitrogen present in Co9S8/NVC-G is around 4.9 %. Out of the total nitrogen content, the occurrence of pyridinic-N and graphitic-N is nearly 16.3% and 45.1%, respectively in Co9S8/NVC-G. From Figure 4d, it is observed that after the heat-treatment at 900 °C, the pyrrolic-N amount in NVC-G is decreased and the amount of pyridinic-N and graphitic-N is increased. [73, 74] This could be attributed to the poor thermal stability of the pyrrolic-N at a higher temperature.[55] The literature reports indicate that the pyridinic-N and graphitic-N are relatively stable at high temperatures than the pyrrolic-N.[56] Also, the pyridinic-N and graphitic-N would facilitate the adsorption of O<sup>2</sup> and improve the ORR activity.[9, 56] In ORR, the pyridinic-N content is reported to be improving the onset potential whereas the graphitic-N content is known to be determining the limiting current.[74] Also, pyridinic-N contributes to improve the stability and the graphitic-N improves the electrical conductivity of the carbon.[75, 76] Therefore, the presence of the pyridinic and graphitic type nitrogen in Co9S8/NVC-G would contribute to improved ORR activity of the system. The deconvoluted cobalt XPS spectra of Co9S8/NVC-G indicate the peaks at 781.2 and 796.3 eV corresponding to the 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 states of Co+3 in Co9S8, respectively (Figure 4e).[57] The peaks at 783.1 and 797.8 eV indicate the 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 states of Co+2 present in Co9S8, respectively.[57] The minute amount of cobalt in Co9S8/NVC-G is present in the zero oxidation state, which is designated with the peak at 778.6 eV.[58] The satellite peaks are present at 786.6 and 802.4 eV, respectively. The deconvoluted sulfur spectra (Figure 4f) display the peaks at 162.3 and 163.9 eV, which are attributed to the Co-S interaction in Co9S8/NVC-G, respectively.[28] The presence of C-S interaction is indicated with the peak at 165.3 eV in the deconvoluted sulfur spectra and this could be originated from the interface between the Co9S<sup>8</sup> and carbon.[59] The sulfate ion is indicated with the peak at 169.1 eV, feasibly formed during the sample preparation. Hence, it is concluded from the material characterizations that the heat-treatment of the materials at 900 °C does not only provide the phase conversion of CoS into the Co9S<sup>8</sup> but it also transforms the pyrrolic nitrogen into the pyridinic and graphitic type nitrogen in the carbon structure.

After the structural characterizations, the electrochemical analysis was performed in both 0.1 M KOH and 0.5 M H2SO<sup>4</sup> solutions, respectively. For this, the three-electrode set-up was employed with glassy carbon as the working electrode, a graphite rod as the counter electrode and Hg/HgO (in the alkaline electrolyte) or Hg/HgSO<sup>4</sup> (in the acidic electrolyte) as the reference electrode, respectively. The examination of the material in 0.1 M KOH solution for ORR is presented in Figure 5. The cyclic voltammograms (CVs) of Co9S8/NVC-G in N<sup>2</sup> and O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH solution performed at a scan rate of 50 mV sec-1 and 900 rpm of the working electrode are illustrated in Figure 5a. It is deduced from Figure 5a that Co9S8/NVC-G displays the sigmoid nature in the O2-saturated condition. The sigmoid feature of CV in

the O2-saturated condition indicates the favourable reduction of O<sup>2</sup> in Co9S8/NVC-G. This demonstrates that Co9S8/NVC-G is facilitating the conversion of O<sup>2</sup> into hydroxyl ions during ORR. More insightful information about the ORR activity of the prepared materials is explained in the following section.

To acquire detailed information on the ORR activity of the prepared materials, linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) has been performed in 0.1 M KOH solution with a scan rate of 10 mV sec-1 and at 1600 rpm of the working electrode. The comparative LSVs of the prepared materials with *state-of-the-art* Pt/C catalyst performed in the O<sup>2</sup> saturated electrolyte is shown in Figure 5b. NVC-G is exhibiting low ORR activity and the corresponding onset potential and half-wave potential (E1/2) values are 0.78 and 0.56 mV, respectively. However, the incorporation of Co9S<sup>8</sup> nanoparticles on NVC-G support is enhancing the ORR activity. This is evident from the improvement in the onset potential as well as E1/2 values of Co9S8/NVC-G. The system displays an onset potential of 0.93 mV and an E1/2 value of 0.77 mV. The ohmic drop is substantially reduced in Co9S8/NVC-G. This could be attributed to the promotional role played by the NVC-G support in retaining the small size of the Co9S<sup>8</sup> nanoparticles and, the possible synergetic interaction between the Co9S<sup>8</sup> nanoparticles with the NVC-G support. Figure S9 shows the LSV comparison of the material obtained before and after the heat-treatment at 900 °C in the argon atmosphere. The corresponding samples are CoS-Co9S8/NVC-G and Co9S8/NVC-G, respectively. It is apparent from Figure S9 that both the onset potential and E1/2 values are noticeably improved in the heat-treated system (Co9S8/NVC-G). However, the CoS-Co9S8/NVC-G displays a lower onset potential value of 0.82 mV with the E1/2 of 0.68 mV. Therefore, nearly 110 mV improvement in the onset potential and 90 mV enhancement in the E1/2 value are achieved after the heat-treatment (Co9S8/NVC-G). This could be ascribed to the conversion of the CoS phase into the Co9S<sup>8</sup> phase after the heat-treatment. Therefore, the improvement in the ORR activity after heattreatment could be attributed to the occurrence of multiple oxidation states of the cobalt in Co9S<sup>8</sup> rather than the single oxidation state of the cobalt in CoS.[80] Also, the crystallinity and graphitization of the material are improved after the heattreatment at 900 °C. The overpotential displayed by Co9S8/NVC-G in comparison to the *state-of-the-art* Pt/C is 70 mV in onset potential and 75 mV in E1/2 values, respectively (Figure 5b).

The plot of ω-1/2 against j-1 is called as the Koutecky-Levich (K-L) plot, indicating the kinetics of the reaction. The K-L plot of Co9S8/NVC-G is provided in Figure 5c. The parallel behaviour at different potentials in the K-L plot indicates the first-order kinetics of ORR in Co9S8/NVC-G.[60] The Tafel plot of the prepared materials is shown in Figure 5d and designates the reaction rate towards ORR. The Tafel slope of NVC-G is 153. 3 mV dec-1 ; the higher Tafel slope value indicates the relatively poor ORR kinetics in NVC-G. However, the Tafel slope is reduced to 65.6 mV dec-1 for Co9S8/NVC-G. This specifies the improved activity accomplished in Co9S8/NVC-G, where nearly 7-8 nm size of the Co9S<sup>8</sup> nanoparticles are distributed uniformly on the NVC-G support. This would favour the adsorption of O<sup>2</sup> molecules and subsequently its reduction, eventually improving the ORR kinetics and resulting in the low Tafel slope value. The Tafel slope of the Pt/C catalyst is 60.6 mV dec-1 , which is in accordance with the literature reports.[18, 61] Hence, the lower Tafel slope values of Co9S8/NVC-G and Pt/C indicate the enhanced ORR activity in these systems.

The impedance analysis provides information about the resistance in the material. Figure 5e indicates the Nyquist plot of the synthesized materials in the O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH solution at 0.60 V *vs*. RHE and at 1600 rpm of the working electrode. Typically, the semicircle in the Nyquist plot designates the charge

**Figure 6.** (a) Comparative LSVs of the samples performed in O2-saturated 0.5 M H2SO<sup>4</sup> solution at 1600 rpm of the working electrode with a scan rate of 10 mV sec-1 , (b) comparative rotating ring disc electrode (RRDE) analysis of Co9S8/NVC-G and Pt/C, (c-d) LSVs recorded before and after ADT of Co9S8/NVC-G and Pt/C in O2-saturated electrolyte at a rotation of 1600 rpm of the working electrode under a scan rate of 10 mV sec-1 .

transfer resistance (RCT) value of the material. The lower RCT value is preferred for the fast ionic movement and is favourable for the improved ORR kinetics. The RCT value of NVC-G is 1438 Ω and of Co9S8/NC-G and Co9S8/NVC are 744 Ω and 823 Ω, respectively. However, the RCT value is drastically reduced to 278 Ω in Co9S8/NVC-G. This could be attributed to the presence of uniformly distributed Co9S<sup>8</sup> nanoparticles on the NVC-G support, which facilitates the fast movement of electrons in the system. Also, the plausible synergetic interaction between the Co9S<sup>8</sup> nanoparticle and NVC- G support promotes the electron transfer during the oxygen reduction in the system. Hence, the study further validates the interaction of Co9S<sup>8</sup> nanoparticles with NVC-G support in the coexisting system and subsequently improves the ORR activity of Co9S8/NVC-G. The rotating ring disc electrode (RRDE) analysis was performed to analyse the number of electron transfer (n) and percentage of hydrogen peroxide (% H2O2) production during ORR. The comparative RRDE data of the synthesized materials and Pt/C is illustrated in Figure S10. The value of n is estimated to be close to 3.6 in Co9S8/NVC-G and the % H2O<sup>2</sup> production is around 20%. Both of these values indicate the occurrence of favourable direct four-electron ORR pathway in Co9S8/NVC-G. The corresponding values of Pt/C are nearly 4 for the number of electron transfer and 5% for the % H2O<sup>2</sup> production.

The durability of the catalyst is particularly important for providing long-term stability in the system. In order to investigate the stability, ADT was performed in the O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH solution. The LSVs were recorded before and after the 5000 cycles of ADT. Co9S8/NVC-G is experiencing only a 19 mV negative shift in the E1/2 value after the ADT analysis (Figure 5f). Both onset potential and limiting current of Co9S8/NVC-G are nearly similar before and after ADT. This indicates the improved chemical stability of the system in the operating conditions. The TEM analysis of Co9S8/NVC-G was performed after the 5000 cycles of ADT and is provided in Figure S11. It is clear from Figure S11a-d that the small size of the Co9S<sup>8</sup> nanoparticles is retained even after the durability analysis. This could be credited to the interaction of Co9S<sup>8</sup> nanoparticles with the nitrogen doped carbon support and thus helps to achieve greater chemical stability in Co9S8/NVC-G. The presence of few-layer carbon on the surface of Co9S<sup>8</sup> nanoparticles prevents agglomeration during the longterm operation which further provides improved stability. The nitrogen doping would improve the corrosion resistance of the carbon and contribute to maintain the structural integrity in the system. For comparison, ADT of the *state-of-the-art* Pt/C was performed under identical conditions. Pt/C was displaying a 35 mV negative shift in the E1/2 value with a reduction in the limiting current after the 5000 cycles of ADT (Figure S12). This designates the poor stability of Pt/C during the long-term operation in the corrosive environment. Since, both Co9S8/NVC-G and Pt/C contain carbon in the system, the presence of nitrogen doped carbon in Co9S8/NVC-G provides structural integrity and activity maintenance in the system. However, poor stability of the carbon support in Pt/C would lead to the agglomeration of the

supported Pt nanoparticles. This would eventually reduce the available active centres in Pt/C and further the activity.

The electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) of Co9S8/NVC-G and Pt/C was calculated from the double-layer capacitance (Cdl) value. For this, CV was performed in the non-Faradaic region (1.02 to 1.12 V *vs*. RHE) at different scan rates of 5, 10, 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100 mV sec-1 (Figure S13a and b). [77- 79] The peak current at 1.07 V (*vs*. RHE) is plotted against the scan rate and obtained a straight line. The slope of the line corresponds to the Cdl value. The ECSA is related to the Cdl value as expressed below:

$$ECSA = C_{dl}/C_{s}$$

where, C<sup>s</sup> is the specific capacitance of the element. The Cdl value of Co9S8/NVC-G and Pt/C are 4.4 and 8.4 mF cm-2 , respectively (Figure S13c). The higher Cdl value of Pt/C could be due to the presence of more number of micropores in the supported carbon, increases the adsorption of the ions. However, in the case of Co9S8/NVC-G, the number of micropores is less in the supported carbon and thereby it shows low ion adsorption capacity and consequently the low Cdl value.

Subsequent to the tests under KOH medium, the ORR activity of the prepared materials was analysed in 0.5 M H2SO<sup>4</sup> solution and the corresponding data is presented in Figure 6. The LSV profiles of the samples recorded in the O2-saturated 0.5 M H2SO<sup>4</sup> solution at a scan rate of 10 mV sec-1 and 1600 rpm of the working electrode are presented in Figure 6a. The ORR activity of NVC-G in the acidic conditions is insignificant with an onset potential of 0.31 V. However, the ORR activity is substantially improved in Co9S8/NVC-G. The onset potential and E1/2 value of Co9S8/NVC-G are 0.82 V and 0.60 V, respectively. These are nearly 140 mV and 170 mV lower as compared to the *state-ofthe-art* Pt/C catalyst. The RRDE analysis was employed in 0.5 M H2SO<sup>4</sup> solution to calculate the value of 'n' and '% H2O2' and the corresponding results are presented in Figure 6b. The peroxide yield was calculated from the RRDE analysis, which is estimated to be around 12 % at 0.40 V with an electron transfer number (n) of 3.8 on Co9S8/NVC-G. The percentage of H2O<sup>2</sup> production obtained here is comparable with many of the non-precious metalbased ORR catalysts reported in the literature.[62] The Pt/C shows a nearly four-electron transfer and a very low H2O<sup>2</sup> production (5%) in the RRDE analysis. Hence, the low H2O<sup>2</sup> yield and close matching of the number of electron transfer near to four indicates the favourable reduction of O<sup>2</sup> during ORR in both Co9S8/NVC-G and Pt/C.

To check the stability of Co9S8/NVC-G and Pt/C in the acidic conditions, ADT was performed for 5000 cycles in the potential window of 0.60 to 1.0 V (*vs*. RHE). The LSVs were recorded before and after ADT. Co9S8/NVC-G displays a negligible shift of nearly 21 mV in the E1/2 value without affecting the onset potential after the 5000 cycles of ADT (Figure 6c). This confirms the outstanding stability of Co9S8/NVC-G in acidic conditions. However, Pt/C is experiencing a severe loss in the performance after the stability test and this could be attributed to the agglomeration of the Pt nanoparticles due to the carbon corrosion. The Pt/C displays a 63 mV negative shift in the E1/2 value along with a 30 mV negative shift in the onset potential (Figure 6d). The TEM images of Co9S8/NVC-G recorded after ADT are presented in Figure S14. The structural integrity of Co9S8/NVC-G after ADT is confirmed from Figure S14a-d. The nitrogen-doped carbon support along with the graphitic carbon layer on the Co9S<sup>8</sup> nanoparticles can help the system to withstand the harsh environment, giving improved stability of Co9S8/NVC-G in the acidic conditions. This further validates the significance of anchoring the Co9S<sup>8</sup> nanoparticles on the nitrogen-doped carbon support. Thus, the half-cell studies in both the alkaline and acidic electrolytes indicate that the ORR activity of Co9S8/NVC-G is better as compared to many of the metal sulfide based systems reported in both the conditions.[28, 29]

Finally, testing of a single cell of a PEMFC was performed by employing Co9S8/NVC-G as the cathode catalyst, Pt/C as the anode catalyst and Nafion-212 as the membrane. The polarization analysis was performed at 60 °C and 100 % RH in the H2-O<sup>2</sup> and H2-air feed conditions and the corresponding current (I) – voltage (V) polarization plots are presented in Figure 7. Co9S8/NVC-G exhibits maximum power densities of 245 mW cm-2 and 115 mW cm-2 in H2-O<sup>2</sup> and H2-air feed conditions, respectively. For comparison, an MEA with Pt/C based cathode was also analysed in similar operating conditions in the single cell mode. The maximum power densities obtained for this system are 650 mW cm-2 and 445 mW cm-2 in the H2-O<sup>2</sup> and H2-air feed conditions, respectively (Figure S15). Even though the single-cell performance of Co9S8/NVC-G based system is lower compared to its counterpart based on Pt/C catalyst, in terms of the system cost and catalyst level durability, the obtained results are

promising for a noble metal-free system (Table S1). Hence, the PEMFC single cell performance analysis validates the promising aspect of Co9S8/NVC-G based ORR catalysts as a potential Ptfree cathode system for PEMFC applications.

#### **Conclusion**

Here, we report the highly efficient and durable ORR catalyst which could be prepared by supporting the graphitic carbon enfolded Co9S<sup>8</sup> nanoparticles on nitrogen-doped carbon (Co9S8/NVC-G). The size of the Co9S<sup>8</sup> nanoparticles is nearly 7-8 nm and the particles are found to be distributed uniformly on the NVC-G support. The present catalyst is exhibiting ORR activity in both acidic and alkaline conditions. The ORR analysis of Co9S8/NVC-G in 0.1 M KOH solution displays only 70 mV negative shift in the onset potential compared to *the state-of-theart* Pt/C system. The E1/2 difference between the present system and Pt/C is nearly 75 mV. The accelerated durability test (ADT) shows only a 19 mV negative shift in the E1/2 value of Co9S8/NVC-G compared to the 35 mV negative shift incurred by Pt/C. The ORR activity investigation in 0.5 M H2SO<sup>4</sup> solution also displays promising performance for Co9S8/NVC-G towards ORR. The differences in the onset potential and E1/2 values of the present system with that of Pt/C are 140 and 170 mV, respectively in the acidic electrolyte condition. The system displays a minor E1/2 shift of 21 mV towards the lower potential after the 5000 cycles of ADT. On the other hand, Pt/C is severely affected by the stability analysis under acidic conditions. The ADT leads to nearly 63 mV negative shift in the E1/2 value along with a 30 mV negative shift in the onset potential for Pt/C. The low H2O<sup>2</sup> production of 12% and the number of electron transfer value of 3.8, which is close to the theoretical value of 4, suggest the promising aspects of Co9S8/NVC-G as a potential ORR catalyst. This performance advantage of Co9S8/NVC-G could be ascribed to the small size of Co9S<sup>8</sup> nanoparticles with few-layer graphitic carbon coating and homogenous dispersion of the nanoparticles on the NVC-G support. This would favour the adsorption of oxygen and subsequently its conversion into hydroxide ions during ORR. Co9S8/NVC-G when employed as the cathode catalyst in an MEA of PEMFC delivered a maximum power density of 245 mW cm-2 in the H2-O<sup>2</sup> atmosphere in its single cell mode of operation. Under H2-air feeding condition, the same system delivered a maximum power density of 115 mW cm-2 . These values obtained on a single cell level is promising due to its prospect to realize a noble metal-free PEMFC system for futuristic applications.

#### **Experimental Section**

### **Materials**

Cobalt chloride hexahydrate (CoCl2. 6H2O), glucose (C6H12O6. H2O), thiourea (CH4N2S) and potassium hydroxide (KOH) were procured from Sigma Aldrich Chemicals. Vulcan carbon was procured from Cabot Corporation, USA. Sulphuric acid (H2SO4), ammonia (NH3), perchloric acid (HClO4) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) were procured from Rankem chemicals. The Nafion-212 membrane was procured from DuPont, GmbH. 40 wt. % Pt/C was procured from Alfa Aesar. All the chemicals were used without further purification.

### **Functionalization of Vulcan carbon (fn-VC)**

Dispersed about 1 g of VC in 200 mL of 30% H2O<sup>2</sup> in a round bottom flask. The material was refluxed in an oil bath at 60 °C for 8 h. After reaching room temperature, filtered and washed the material with an excess quantity of DI water. The obtained black material was dried in a vacuum oven at 50 °C for 6 h. The material is hereafter called as fn-VC and used directly for further reactions.

#### **Synthesis of Co9S8/NVC-G**

For the synthesis of Co9S8/NVC-G, dispersed about 100 mg of fn-VC in 30 mL of DI water. To this, added 5.5 mmol of glucose (C6H12O6. H2O) and stirred for 2 h at room temperature. About 1.2 mmol of cobalt chloride hexahydrate (CoCl2. 6H2O), 2.5 mmol of thiourea (CH4N2S) and 2 mL of ammonia (NH3) were added in the above mixture and stirred for 1 h. Transferred the entire mixture into a Teflon lined autoclave and carried out the reaction at 200 °C for 8 h. After reaching room temperature, filtered the material with an excess quantity of DI water and dried at 60 °C in a vacuum oven for 5 h. The obtained powder material was subjected to acid washing in 0.5 M H2SO<sup>4</sup> solution at 80 °C for 8 h to remove any unreacted metal precursors. The obtained material was washed with a copious amount of DI water and dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C for 5 h. The material obtained in this step contains the mixed phases of CoS and Co9S<sup>8</sup> supported on nitrogen-doped carbon. The powder material was heat-treated at 900 °C for 1 h in argon atmosphere to convert the CoS phase present in the system to the Co9S<sup>8</sup> phase. The obtained material is named hereafter as Co9S8/NVC-G.

For comparison, materials were synthesized in the absence of fn-VC, glucose and NH<sup>3</sup> by keeping the other parameters identical as above and thus obtained materials are named as Co9S8/NC-G, Co9S8/NVC, and Co9S8/VC-G, respectively. NVC-G was prepared by treating fn-VC, glucose, and NH<sup>3</sup> through the hydrothermal route at 200 °C for 8 h.

#### **Electrochemical Analysis**

In order to analyze the electrochemical activity of the as synthesized materials, the three-electrode set-up was used. A glassy carbon electrode (0.196 cm<sup>2</sup> ) was used as the working electrode and a graphite rod was used as the counter electrode. In the KOH electrolyte, Hg/HgO and in the H2SO<sup>4</sup> electrolyte, Hg/HgSO<sup>4</sup> were used as the reference electrode, respectively. Catalyst ink for the electrochemical analysis was prepared by mixing 5 mg of the catalyst in 1 mL of DI water-isopropyl alcohol mixture (3:1) and 40 µL of 5 wt. % Nafion solution (DuPont, GmbH) by bath sonication. Drop coated an aliquot of the catalyst ink on the glassy carbon electrode and kept it for drying. The catalyst loading used was 0.25 mg cmin 0.1 M KOH solution. Since ORR kinetics is moderately slower for nonprecious-metal based systems in acidic medium, the catalyst loading used in 0.5 M H2SO<sup>4</sup> was 0.50 mg cm-2 . [18, 40] For comparison, the *state-of-theart* 40 wt. % Pt/C was also investigated under identical conditions. For this purpose, the catalyst slurry was prepared by following the above method and about 10 µL of the aliquot was drop coated on the glassy carbon electrode. To understand the stability of the catalyst, 5000 cycles of accelerated durability test (ADT) was performed in both the alkaline and acidic conditions. For this, CV was performed in O2-saturated electrolyte in the potential window of 0.60 to 1.0 V *vs*. RHE with a scan rate of 100 mV sec-1 . The LSVs were performed before and after ADT in O2-saturated electrolyte at 1600 rpm of the working electrode and with a scan rate of 10 mV sec-1 .

The Koutecky-Levich (K-L) equation was used to obtain the kinetics of the reaction and the corresponding equations are given as below:

1/j = 1/j<sup>L</sup> +1/j<sup>k</sup>

The rotating ring disc electrode (RRDE) analysis was performed to find out the number of electron transfer (n) and percentage of hydrogen peroxide (%  $H_2O_2$ ) produced during the reaction by using the following equations:

$$n = 4I_d/(I_d+I_r/N)$$

 $H_2O_2 = 200^* I_r/N/(I_d+I_r/N)$ 

where,  $I_r$ ,  $I_d$ , and N are the ring current, disc current and collection efficiency (0.37), respectively.

# Membrane electrode assembly (MEA) preparation and single-cell analysis

The membrane (Nafion-212) pre-treatment was carried out in sequential with 5% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and 1 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, respectively. First, the membrane was treated at 80 °C for 1 h with 5% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> to remove any organic impurities. It was then boiled at 100 °C in DI water for 1 h. In order to protonate, the membrane was treated with 1 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> at 80 °C for 1 h. Subsequently, it was boiled for 1 h in DI water at 100 °C and stored at room temperature in DI water. For the fuel cell performance analysis, Co<sub>9</sub>S<sub>8</sub>/NVC-G was employed as the cathode catalyst. Pt/C was used as the anode catalyst and the pre-treated Nafion-212 membrane was used as the separator cum solid electrolyte. The electrodes were made by brush coating the catalyst slurry on a gas diffusion layer (GDL) with a loading of 2.5 mg cm<sup>-2</sup> of the Pt-free catalyst on the cathode and 0.50 mg<sub>Pt</sub> cm<sup>-2</sup> of the 40 wt.% Pt/C catalyst on the anode. The membrane electrode assembly (MEA) was fabricated by sandwiching the anode-membrane-cathode combination at 0.25 ton for 1 min. at 130 °C in a hot-press (CARVER, USA). The active area of the MEA was 4 cm<sup>2</sup>. The MEA was assembled in a standard singlecell fixture (Fuel Cell Technologies Inc., USA) with the single serpentine flow-field pattern on the graphite plates. The fuel cell performance was analyzed by using a commercial fuel cell test station (Fuel Cell Technologies Inc., USA). Current (I) - Voltage (V) polarization tests were performed in the H2-O2 and H2-air feeding conditions. All the measurements were carried out at 60 °C with a relative humidity of 100%. The flow rates of H<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub> and air are 0.2, 0.3 and 0.5 slpm, respectively during the I-V polarization tests. For comparison, an MEA based on Pt/C as the cathode catalyst (0.50 mg<sub>Pt</sub> cm<sup>-2</sup>) was also performed under similar conditions.

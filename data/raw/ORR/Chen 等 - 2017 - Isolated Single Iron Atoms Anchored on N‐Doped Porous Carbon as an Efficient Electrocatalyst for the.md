Abstract: The development of low-cost, efficient, and stable electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is desirable but remains a great challenge. Herein, we made a highly reactive and stable isolated single-atom Fe/N-doped porous carbon (ISA Fe/CN) catalyst with Fe loading up to 2.16 wt %. The catalyst showed excellent ORR performance with a half-wave potential  $(E_{1/2})$  of 0.900 V, which outperformed commercial Pt/C and most non-precious-metal catalysts reported to date. Besides exceptionally high kinetic current density  $(J_k)$  of 37.83 mV cm<sup>-2</sup> at 0.85 V, it also had a good methanol tolerance and outstanding stability. Experiments demonstrated that maintaining the Fe as isolated atoms and incorporating nitrogen was essential to deliver the high performance. First principle calculations further attributed the high reactivity to the high efficiency of the single Fe atoms in transporting electrons to the adsorbed OH species.

The electrochemical oxygen reduction has attracted extensive interest owing to its applications in energy conversion and storage. [11] The precious-metal-group (PMG) materials are generally efficient electrocatalysts for ORR, [21] however, the high cost, scarcity, low stability, and poor methanol tolerance limit their large-scale application. [31] Therefore, it is important to explore high-performance, durable, and earth-abundant substitutes. [41] Recently, Fe-based materials have emerged as one of the most promising alternatives to PMG catalysts. [51] However, the active sites of most Fe-based materials have not been clearly identified, [61] and the reactivity still needs to be improved to promote their practical application. [71]

In catalysis, a consensus is that the reactivity can be enhanced by increasing the number of exposed active sites. [8] Single-atom catalysts (SACs) represent the lowest size limit to obtain the maximum atom efficiency and expose the most active sites in catalysts, [9] which is now regarded as a new research frontier. [10] However, it is still a grand challenge to preparing single-atom catalysts and to prevent migration and agglomeration during catalytic process. [9b,11]

Herein, we prepare a highly stable isolated single-atom iron catalyst with excellent ORR reactivity via a cageencapsulated-precursor pyrolysis strategy. The as-obtained catalyst exhibited highly efficient activity with unexpectedly high  $J_k$  of 37.85 mV cm<sup>-2</sup> at 0.85 V, and  $E_{1/2}$  of 0.900 V in 0.1M KOH, which is 58 mV more positive than that of the commercial Pt/C ( $E_{1/2}$  of 0.842 V). Moreover, it also showed good methanol tolerance and excellent stability, displayed no obvious current change in the presence of 1.0 M MeOH and little ORR polarization curve shift after 5000 cycles. It is one of the best non-precious metal ORR electrocatalysts to date. Experiments and DFT calculations demonstrated that the ORR performance was ascribed to the formation of atomically isolated iron atoms coordinated four N atoms and with one O2 molecule adsorbed end-on. Our work may help accelerate the development of high-performance, stable, and low-cost catalysts at atomic scale.

The preparation procedure is shown in Figure 1a. We employed zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIF-8) with cavity diameter  $(d_c)$  of 11.6 Å and pore diameter  $(d_n)$  of 3.4 Å as molecular-scale cages to separate and encapsulate the metal precursor Fe(acac)<sub>3</sub> (molecular diameter, ca. 9.7 Å). Fe(acac)<sub>3</sub> was mixed with the precursors of ZIF-8. The molecular-scale cages formed along with the assembly of Zn<sup>2+</sup> and 2-methylimidazole and one Fe(acac)<sub>3</sub> molecule was trapped in one cage as a result of size of pore and cavity (denoted as Fe(acac)<sub>3</sub>@ZIF-8). After pyrolysis at 900°C under Ar atmosphere, ZIF-8 transformed into nitrogendoped porous carbon. Meanwhile, Fe(acac)<sub>3</sub> within the cage was reduced by carbonization of the organic linker, leading to the formation of isolated single iron atoms anchored on nitrogen species (Fe-ISAs/CN). The morphology of Fe-ISAs/ CN was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Figure 1b and Figure S1 in the Supporting Information show that Fe-ISAs/CN retained its initial dodecahedral shape after thermal treatment, while its surface became much rougher. The mapping images showed that Fe, C, and N were distributed uniformly over the entire architecture (Figure 1c). Fe single atoms were observed by atomic-resolution highangle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron

microscope (HAADF-STEM) analysis (Figure 1d and Figure S2a,c), which were identified by isolated bright dots marked with red cycles (Figure 1e and Figure S2b,d).

Powder XRD pattern of Fe(acac)<sub>3</sub>@ZIF-8 well matched ZIF-8. Fe-ISAs/CN showed a broad shoulder peak in the range 20–30° (2 theta) (Figure S3a), which was the same as that of CN, deriving from pure ZIF-8. This peak was assigned to the (002) plane of the graphitic carbon, as further confirmed by  $I_{\rm D}/I_{\rm G}$  value in Raman spectra (Figure S3b). The binding states of C and N in this sample were investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Figure S3c,d) The N 1 s spectrum revealed the coexistence of graphitic (401.6 eV), pyrrolic (400.6 eV), and pyridinic (398.6 eV) nitrogen species, which served as anchor points for iron atoms. The Fe content in this catalyst loaded up to 2.16 wt %, according to the coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) result.

To confirm the structure of Fe-ISAs/CN in atomic level, X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) were performed. The XANES curves of Fe-ISAs/CN in Figure 2 a shows near-edge absorption energy between those of  $Fe_2O_3$  and Fe foil, implying Fe single atoms carried positive charges. As shown in Figure 2b, FT-EXAFS curve for Fe-ISAs/CN

only showed a main peak at about 1.5 Å which (without phase correction) could be attributed to Fe-N(O) scattering paths, and the Fe-Fe peak at about 2.2 Å was not detected. To more clearly indicate the atomic dispersion of iron throughout the whole Fe ISAs/CN, wavelet transform (WT) of Fe k-edge EXAFS oscillations was carried out owing to its powerful resolutions in both k and R spaces.<sup>[12]</sup> From the WT contour plots of Fe bulk and Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> standards (Figure 2d,e), it could be observed that the intensity maxima at 5 and 8 Å<sup>-1</sup> were associated with the Fe-N(O) and Fe-Fe contributions, respectively. Impressively, the WT contour plot of Fe ISAs/CN displayed only one intensity maximum at 5  $Å^{-1}$ , which could be ascribed to the Fe-N(O) bonding. Therefore, according to FT- and WT-EXAFS analysis, it could be concluded that iron atoms were atomically dispersed in Fe-ISAs/CN.

A least-squares EXAFS fitting was carried out to obtain quantitative structural parameters of Fe in the Fe-ISAs/CN. The EXAFS fitting parameters were listed in Table S1 and the fitting curves were exhibited in Figure 2 f and Figure S4. The coordination number of Fe was about 5 and the mean bond length was 2.01 Å. Based on the above analysis, the local atomic structure around Fe was constructed and it was demonstrated that isolated Fe atom was atomically anchored in the nitrogen doped porous carbon matrix and was four-fold coordinated by N atoms. What's more, one O2 molecule was considered to adsorb on the Fe atom in perpendicular to Fe-N<sub>4</sub> porphyrin plane. The atomic structure model was illustrated in Figure 2 g. The best-fit results of Fe foil and Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> are displayed in Figure S5 and Figure S6, respectively.

The ORR activity of Fe-ISAs/CN was investigated in O<sub>2</sub>-saturated 0.1m KOH with rotating disk electrode (RDE) measurement. The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) results (Figure 3 a) indicated that Fe-ISAs/CN showed the best activity in term of the most positive onset ( $E_{\rm onset}$ ) and  $E_{1/2}$ . As shown in Figure 3 b and Table S2, the  $E_{1/2}$  of Fe-ISAs/CN was 0.900 V, which was 58 mV more positive, compared with that of Pt/C and surpassed that of most non-precious metal ORR electrocatalysts (Table S3). It also exhibited good ORR activity in acidic solution (Figure S7). Moreover, it exhibited exceptionally  $J_{\rm k}$  of 37.83 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> at 0.85 V, 7.6 times as that of Pt/C (4.99 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>). As a reference, CN catalyst exhibited a poor  $E_{1/2}$  of 0.765 V, indicating the critical role of isolated iron atoms for enhancing ORR performance.

LSV measurements were recorded at different rotation rate (Figure 3c). Figure 3c inset represented the corresponding Koutecky-Levich (K-L) plots. Based on the K-L equation, the value of electron transfer number (*n*) was calculated to be approximately 3.9, close to the theoretical value of 4.0 for Pt/C. The better ORR activity was further confirmed by smaller Tafel slope (58 mV decade<sup>-1</sup> versus 78 mV decade<sup>-1</sup> for Pt/C, Figure S8). Rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE) test results (Figure 3d) revealed that the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> yield over Fe-ISAs/CN remained below 5% at the whole potential range. These results confirmed that catalytic process at the Fe-ISAs/CN

electrode underwent a four-electron ORR pathway, which mean it had high ORR catalytic efficiency.

To examine the fuel crossover effect, Fe-ISAs/CN and Pt/C were cycled in both  $O_2$ -stratured 0.1M KOH and  $O_2$ -stratured 0.1M KOH + 1.0M methanol solutions. There was no obvious change in the current density on Fe-ISAs/CN after injecting 1.0M methanol into the solution (Figure 3e and Figure S9), however, the cathodic ORR peak vanished and the typical inverse peak for the oxidation of methanol appeared in CV for Pt/C (Figure S10). The above result demonstrated that Fe-ISAs/CN had excellent tolerance to methanol crossover.

The durability of Fe-ISAs/CN was assessed by cycling the catalyst between 0.6 and 1.0 V at a sweep rate of 50 mV s<sup>-1</sup> in O<sub>2</sub>-saturated 0.1m KOH. After 5000 continuous cycles (Figure 3 f), there was very little change in  $E_{1/2}$  (ca. 2 mV), demonstrating the Fe-ISAs/CN had the superb stability. The atomically dispersed iron retained in Fe-ISAs/CN after methanol crossover and durability test, as confirmed by careful examination of HAADF images (Figure S11).

On the basis of electrochemical results, we speculated that super ORR activity of Fe-ISAs/CN could be attributed to isolated iron atoms, coordinated to nitrogen atoms. To confirm this, two control experiments were carried out. The Fe-ISAs and nanoparticles (NPs)/CN catalyst was prepared by the same procedure as that used for synthesis of Fe-ISAs/CN except with six times the amount of iron precursor. As shown in Figure S12-S15, some Fe nanoparticles were formed by random aggregation of isolated iron atoms during pyrolysis since extra iron atoms were not able to be incorporated with nitrogen. The coexistence of isolated iron atoms and iron nanoparticles was confirmed by HADDF-STEM (Figure S16) and XAFS (Figure S17-S19). Fe-ISAs and NPs/CN was leached in 0.5 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> solution for 24 h at 80 °C to remove substantially metallic Fe nanoparticles. After acid leaching, onyl a few nanoparticles were left (Figure S20-S22). As shown in Figure S23, the patterns of Fe diminished. On the basis of results, we believed that the Fe nanoparticles were removed and the isolated iron atoms maintained. Compared with Fe-ISAs and NPs/CN, the  $E_{1/2}$  of acid-leached Fe-ISAs and NPs/CN significantly increased by 42 mV, indicating that the promotion of activity was attributed to maintaining the metal center Fe as atomically dispersed sites.

It is established that the SCN<sup>-</sup> ion has a high affinity to iron and can poison isolated Fe-N<sub>4</sub> coordination sites that are catalyzing ORR. [6c,13] As shown in Figure 4b, the  $E_{\rm onset}$

and  $E_{1/2}$  of Fe-ISAs/CN negatively shifted by 90 mV and 95 mV, respectively, after adding 0.01m NaSCN into O<sub>2</sub>saturated 0.1M HClO<sub>4</sub>. Then the electrode was rinsed with water until pH = 7 and re-measured in 0.1 m O<sub>2</sub>-saturated KOH. As shown in Figure 4c, the ORR polarization curve gradually positively shifted and finally recovered to the original level of the continuous LSV tests. The phenomenon was attributed to the recovery of isolated Fe-N<sub>4</sub> sites on account of dissociation of the SCN- in 0.1M KOH solution. These experimental studies clearly elucidated that isolated Fe-N<sub>4</sub> coordination sites were the origin of ORR activity of

To understand the nature of the high ORR reactivity of Fe-ISAs/CN, we further performed density functional theory (DFT) calculations to investigate the free energetics of the four-electron ORR reaction mechanism. The computational details are in the Supporting Information (Table S4-S7 and Figure S24-S26). For comparison, both Fe-ISAs/CN and Fe particles were considered. The free-energy paths of ORR are shown in Figure 4d and the detail reaction energetics at U=0 V are listed in Table S4. The free energy for each elementary step was calculated by combining the enthalpy and the harmonic entropy, which are listed in Table S5-S7. The whole catalytic cycle was divided into five elementary steps:

- $O_2(g) + * \rightarrow O_2*$
- $O_2^* + H_2O(l) + e^- \rightarrow OOH^* + OH^-$
- iii)  $OOH^* + e^- \rightarrow O^* + OH^-$
- iv)  $O^* + H_2O(1) + e^- \rightarrow OH^* + OH^-$
- $OH^* + e^- \rightarrow OH^- + *$

in which \* indicates the adsorption site and the steps (ii)-(v) corresponded to the four-electron transfer processes. It was shown that on both Fe ISAs/CN and Fe particles the first three electron-transfer steps (ii, iii, and iv) exhibited similar free-energy changes at U=0 V, except the last electron-

transfer step (v). Both the first electron transfer step (ii) and the last electron tranfer step(v) was endothermic at U=0 V, suggesting that the external force (i.e. applied voltage) was needed to drive these processes. By comparing the free energetics, the rate determining step (RDS) was predicted to be the last electrontransfer step (v), which experiences the highest endothermic energy. The estimated overpotential, above which the RDS became exothermic, was estimated to be 0.65 V for the Fe-ISAs/CN, much lower than 1.76 V for the Fe particles. These results indicated that the reactivity of ORR on both catalysts was mainly controlled by the last elementary step, that is, charging of the adsorbed \*OH to form OH<sup>-</sup>, and the high reactivity of Fe-ISAs/CN originating from the easier electron transfers from Fe single atom to the adsorbed \*OH species. This was further confirmed by the electronic chemical potential calculations. The Fe-ISAs/CN had a significantly higher electronic chemical potential of 3.89 eV than that for iron particles (2.96 eV) and thus was much easier to accept external electrons from the applied potential. In Figure 4d, we also showed the free energy path for ISAs-CN at U = -1.0 V and all the elementary steps

became exothermic, suggesting a highly reactive ORR process under this condition, consistent with our experimental observations.

In summary, we have developed a stable N-porous carbon with isolated single iron atoms anchored to it. The preparation utilizes a cage-encapsulated-precursor pyrolysis strategy. The structure of the Fe-ISAs/CN was characterized by HAADF-STEM and XAFS. The catalyst showed excellent ORR activity, good methanol tolerance, and great stability. The crucial role of atomically dispersed iron was further understood by control experiments and DFT calculations. This work opens up new opportunities for the application of high-efficiency and stable noble-metal-free single-atom cata-

Isolated Single Iron Atoms Anchored on N-Doped Porous Carbon as an Efficient Electrocatalyst for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction

Gemeinsam allein: Isolierte Eisenatome, die über eine Pyrolysestrategie ausgehend von verkapselten Käfigen auf Ndotiertem porösem Kohlenstoff verankert wurden, zeigen exzellente Eigenschaften in der Sauerstoffreduktion (ORR), gute Methanoltoleranz und herausragende Stabilität. Kontrollexperimente und theoretische Studien belegen, dass die ORR-Aktivität aus dem atomar dispergierten Eisen resultiert.

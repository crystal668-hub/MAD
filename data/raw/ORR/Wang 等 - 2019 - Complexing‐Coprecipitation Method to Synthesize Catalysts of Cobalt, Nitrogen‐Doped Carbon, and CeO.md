Ternary catalyst Co-NC-CeO<sub>2</sub> was synthesized via a simple 'one-pot' and 'one-step' method, and it exhibited excellent ORR performances, with half-wave potential of 817 mV (vs RHE), a diffusion limited current density of 4.72 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, and a good durability (half-wave potential exhibiting a negative shift of only 17 mV after 1000 cycles). It can be attributed to the synergistic effect among Co nanoparticles, nitrogen doped carbon layer and CeO<sub>2</sub> nanosheets.

### **Abstract**

The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is the key cathode reaction process in the renewable-energy technologies. Developing high-efficient, low-cost, good methanol tolerant and good long-term durable ORR catalyst is highly demanded. In this research, we reported a rather simple complexing-coprecipitation method to synthesize CeO<sup>2</sup> nanosheets encapsulated by nitrogen doped carbon layer (NC) with uniformly dispersed Co nanoparticles catalysts on the surface. In particular, the 0.5Co-NC-CeO<sup>2</sup> sample exhibits high ORR catalytic activity with an onset potential of 875 mV (vs RHE), a diffusion limited current density of 4.72 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> and a positive half-wave potential of 817 mV (vs RHE), while 20% Pt/C presents an onset potential of 934 mV (vs RHE), a diffusion limited current density of 5.8 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> and half-wave potential of 850 mV (vs RHE). And the catalyst 0.5Co-NC-CeO2also possesses a robust durability, that is the half-wave potential exhibits a negative shift of only 17 mV after 1000 cycles. The enhanced ORR performance can be attributed to the synergistic effect among Co, nitrogen doped carbon layer and CeO2. The results demonstrated here have implications in designing non-Pt ORR catalysts.

### **Introduction**

The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is the key cathode reaction process in the renewable-energy technologies <sup>1</sup> , such as fuel cells and Li-O<sup>2</sup> batteries. However, the ORR kinetics are usually more sluggish than the anodic counterpart. Noble metals such as Pd, Pt and their alloys are generally applied as the ORR catalyst 2, <sup>3</sup> , but the high price, the scarcity of the noble metals, low CO/sulfur tolerance and poor long-term operation durability limit their practical applications <sup>4</sup> . Therefore, the searching for alternative transition metals 5, 6, 7, <sup>8</sup> and metal oxides 9, <sup>10</sup> catalysts is highly desired, attributing to their low cost, highly active, simple preparation and good stability.

<span id="page-3-1"></span><span id="page-3-0"></span>CeO<sup>2</sup> has been well reported as one of the promising ORR catalysts, owing to its facile valence state transition between Ce3+ and Ce4+ , which leads to the intrinsically decent electronic/ionic conductivity 11, 12, 13, 14 .In addition, the high oxygen-storage capacity of CeO<sup>2</sup> is beneficial for oxygen sorption. The further improvement of the ORR activity of CeO<sup>2</sup> can be accomplished by adopoting nanostructures, surface modification as well as decorating with other transition metals 15, 16, 17, <sup>18</sup> . For instance, threedimensional graphene was used to support the ultrathin CeO<sup>2</sup> nanoflakes to generate the composite catalyst, and its ORR performance boosted <sup>13</sup> . CeO2@nitrogen doped carbon was synthesized by incorporating CeO<sup>2</sup> nanoparticles into the cavity of zeolitic imidazolate framework-8, followed by pyrolysis at 900 °C. The ORR performance was highly improved by such carbon coating <sup>19</sup> . CeO2-Co-nitrogen doped carbon hollow nanospheres showed a positive onset potential of 0.922 V vs. RHE, a halfwave potential of 0.797 V vs. RHE, and a diffusion-limited current density of 5.37 mA cm-2 , which is dramatically supurior to those of the Co free CeO2-nitrogen doped carbon composite. The can be attributing to the high conductivity of Co, and the larger amount oxygen vacancies created by Co as the electron donor <sup>15</sup> .

Based on the above consideration, this work designed a Cobalt metalnitrogen doped carbon-CeO<sup>2</sup> nanosheet (Co-NC-CeO2) ternary composite as ORR catalyst. CeO<sup>2</sup> nanosheets, which were prepared by the simple complexing-coprecipitation method, are elected as the catalyst backbone. The employed method allows the scale up synthesis of CeO<sup>2</sup> nanosheet with uniform size and thickness. A nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) layer, which was derived from the biomass dopamine (DA), is coated on the CeO<sup>2</sup> nanosheets as the surface modifier. The addition of nitrogen makes the carbon more disordered, resulting in more defect sites for catalysis, and an enhanced ORR performance is anticipated. Furthermore, Co nanoparticles, which were dispersed in the NC layer, serve as the additional catalytic sites. As a result, this Co-nitrogen doped carbon-CeO<sup>2</sup> composites achieve superior performances in ORR, which is attributed to the cooperative eff ect at their heterostructured interface.

#### **Materials Characterization**

The morphology of the samples was observed by HITACHI S-4800 scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-2100F) equipped with Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). XRD patterns were obtained with a Bruker D8 advance diffractometer operating with Cu K<sup>α</sup> radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) at 10<sup>o</sup> /min scanning speed in the 2*θ* range from 5 ° to 80 °. Raman spectra were collected on a Horiba XploRA Nano Spectrometer using a laser with an excitation wavelength of 532 nm at a laser power of 0.5 W. XPS experiments were carried out on an RBD upgraded PHI-5000C ESCA system (Perkin Elmer) with Mg Kα radiation (hν = 1253.6 eV). The nitrogen adsorption-desorption measurements (Quantachrome Instrument Corp) were used to obtain the nitrogen physisorption isotherms at 77 K. Surface areas were evaluated using the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method from the adsorption branch of the isotherm. The pore size distributions were calculated according to the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) model, and the average pore diameters and cumulative pore volumes were calculated using the desorption branch of the isotherm.

#### **Results and Discussion**

The synthesis route of 0.5Co-NC-CeO<sup>2</sup> was illustrated in **Scheme 1**. CeO<sup>2</sup> nanosheets were prepared by a facile one-step complexing-coprecipitation approach, following 600 <sup>o</sup>C heat treatment (CeO2-600). The

CeO2-600 nanosheets were then immersed into the Tris-HCl buffer solution (pH = 8.5) containing DA and Co2+ ions. As is well known, DA will polymerize spontaneously in Tris-HCl buffer solution to form polydopamine (PDA) (in **Scheme 1**) <sup>20</sup>. This in-situ polymeraztion process enables a good interfacial adhesion so the nitrogen contained PDA will uniformly coated on the CeO<sup>2</sup> nanosheet surface. In the meantime, Co2+ ions were adsorbed on PDA surface to form the Co2+ -PDA-CeO<sup>2</sup> complex precursor. In the subsequent carbonization process, PDA will transfer to nitrogen doped carbon (NC) and encapsulate the CeO<sup>2</sup> nanosheets, while the metallic Co nanoparticles will in-situ formed and disperse uniformly on the NC layer surface. Thus, a Co-NC-CeO2composite catalyst can be obtained.

Compared with other preparation methods 12, 15, 21, 22 , here the CeO<sup>2</sup> nanosheets encapsulated by nitrogen doped carbon layer with uniformly dispersed Co nanoparticles can be prepared in one step. The nitrogen doped carbon was achieved by directly carbonizing the N contained precursor, and Co ions can be reduced to Co metal simultaneously during the process. Such method offered a simple but scale-up route to prepare composite with designed compositions.

**Scheme 1** Schematic illustration of the processing of Co-NC-CeO2.

The above synthesis route was verified by series of materials characterizations. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of NC-CeO2and 0.5Co-NC-CeO<sup>2</sup> are shown in **Figure 1a**. A broad peak around 22 <sup>o</sup> is associated with the carbon layer. The sharp Bragg diffraction peaks located at ~28.6 °, 33.1 °, 47.5 °, 56.3 °, 59.1 °and 69.4 ° were indexed to the facecentered cubic fluorite phase of CeO<sup>2</sup> (JCPDS no. 34-0394) **错误!未定义书签。** . In the 0.5Co-NC-CeO2sample, additional peak located at 44.2 ° was observed, which can be indexed to the (111) planes of face-centered cubic (fcc) metallic cobalt (JCPDS 15-0806). This proves that the metallic Co was successfully formed on the NC-CeO2. It is also found that other metals such as Cu, Ni and Fe can be formed upon carbonization process in the same manner, as shown in **Figure S1a**. This indicates the proposed route is a general method to prepare metal-NC-CeO<sup>2</sup> composite catalyst. The Raman spectra were shown in **Figure 1b**. One strong peak at around 462 cm-1 was observed in CeO2-600 and 0.5Co-NC-CeO2, which is the characteristic

peak for Ceria <sup>23</sup>. The peaks at 1340 and 1594 cm-1 in 0.5Co-NC-CeO<sup>2</sup> justified the existence of the carbon layer in the sample, since they can be identified to the D and G band of carbon. The ratio of D band to G band (ID/IG= 1.03) confirmed the presence of the structural defects in the carbon layer assigned to the nitrogen-bonded sp<sup>2</sup> -C and sp<sup>3</sup> -C species 24, 25, <sup>26</sup> .

**Figure 1** (a) XRD patterns of NC-CeO<sup>2</sup> and 0.5Co-NC-CeO<sup>2</sup> and (b) Raman spectra of CeO2-600 and 0.5Co-NC-CeO2.

The morphology of the samples is demonstrated in **Figure 2**. The SEM image of the pristine CeO2-600 in **Figure 2**a revealed smooth nanosheets with sizes up to several micrometers. Such morphology is the result of the coordination effect, that is the combination of noncovalent interactions, including hydrogen-bonding and π-π stacking between Ce3+ and the -COO- groups in BTA, which lead to the formation of nanosheet structure 27, <sup>28</sup> . After carbonization process, the nanosheet morphology remained intact as shown in **Figure 2b**, except the surface of the 0.5Co-NC-CeO<sup>2</sup> sheet became coarse and small nanoparticles can be observed. This is due to the nitrogen doped carbon coating and the metallic Co nanoparticles decorating. The TEM and the HRTEM of the CeO2-600 nanosheet (**Figure 2c and d**) also revealed the nanosheet feature and the good crystallinity. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) rings proves the polycrystalline nature of the sample, while the labeled lattice fringe of 0.308 nm is corresponding to (1 1 1) lattice planes of CeO2. For the 0.5Co-NC-CeO<sup>2</sup> sample, the nanosheet can be also seen in the TEM image (**Figure 2e, f** and **Figure S2**), while the metallic Co nanoparticles with the lattice fringe of 0.200 nm were clearly demonstrated. The size of a single Co nanoparticle was ~ 15 nm, and the thickness of the carbon layer was about 2-5 nm. Similar carbon encapsulated CeO<sup>2</sup> structures have been extensively reported in literature as ORR catalysts 15, 16, <sup>29</sup>. It is believed that such thin layer carbon coating will not affect the oxygen sorption severely <sup>30</sup> . The further C, Ce and O elements distribution in this sample was found homogeneous, revealing the uniform encapsulation of CeO<sup>2</sup> by the nitrogen doped carbon (**Figure S3**). The Co element distinguished itself as nanoparticles dispersed on the nanosheet surface. The elements percentage of 0.5Co-NC-CeO2obtained from EDX analysis was shown in **Table S1**. The weight percentage of Co was about 3.4%. The surface area of the samples was examined by N<sup>2</sup> adsorption-desorption, which was shown in **Figure S4a**. CeO2-600, NC-CeO<sup>2</sup> and 0.5Co-NC-CeO<sup>2</sup> had the surface area of 40.2, 87.7 and 165.0 m<sup>2</sup> g -1 , and the pore volume of 0.122,

0.145 and 0.270 cm<sup>3</sup> g -1 , respectively. The analysis of the mesopore size distribution was accomplished by BJH method, as was shown in **Figure S4b**. In 0.5Co-NC-CeO2, an increment of the larger pore portion (at ~15 nm) was observed. The BET surface area and the total volume of 0.5Co-NC-CeO2were significantly increased after modifying by carbon layer and Co nanoparticles, leading to its enhanced ORR performance.

The chemical states of the 0.5Co-NC-CeO<sup>2</sup> were evaluated by XPS, as shown in **Figure 3**. The C, N, Co, O and Ce elements were clearly shown in the XPS survey spectrum in **Figure 3a**. In **Figure 3b** (Ce 3d), two peaks labeled as u<sup>3</sup> and v<sup>3</sup> located at 884.9 and 903.5 eV, respectively, were assigned to Ce3+ and the other six peaks labeled as u1(898.4 eV), u2(888.9 eV), u<sup>4</sup> (882.6 eV) and v1(916.8 eV), v2(907.4 eV), v<sup>4</sup> (901.1 eV) were related to the characteristic peaks of Ce4+ as displayed in the Ce 3d spectrum [13,](#page-3-0) 18, <sup>31</sup> . It demonstrated that Ce3+ and Ce4+ coexisted in 0.5Co-NC-CeO2. The percentage of Ce3+ was ~0.152, which was calculated by dividing the integrated area of Ce3+ peaks by the sum of Ce3+ and Ce4+ peaks (A(Ce3+) + A(Ce4+)) 32, <sup>33</sup> . The Ce3+ defects and the formation of oxygen vacancies were considered to provide catalytic active sites, which was beneficial to achieve enhanced ORR performance. The high-resolution N 1s spectrum (**Figure 3c**) revealed that the doped N atoms existed in the form of pyridinic-N (398.4 eV), pyrrolic-N (400.8 eV), and graphitic-N (403.5 eV). The C 1s spectrum (**Figure 3f**) was divided into four peaks labeled as C1 (290.5 eV), C2 (288.3 eV), C3 (286.4 eV) and C4 (284.6 eV), which can be attributed to O-C=O, C-O-C/C-N, C=N/C-O and C=C bonding, respectively <sup>15</sup>. The deconvolution results of C 1s indicated the formation of a heteroatomic bond between oxygen and nitrogen. In addition, the O 1s spectrum can be deconvoluted into three peaks located at 529.6 eV (Ce-O), 531.5 eV (C-O) and 533.3 eV (C=O) in **Figure 3e**. Similarly, Co 2p spectrum showed zero-valence state (777.9 and 793.0 eV) and ionic state (780.0 and 795.5 eV) cobalt with shakeup satellites (784.9 and 802.7 eV) in **Figure 3d** 34, <sup>35</sup> . The ionic state of Co was due to the oxidation of the very surface of the Co metal when exposed to the moisture in air. The coexistence of such two states has been reported in literature 36, 37, 38, 39 . These results illustrated the effective doping of nitrogen into the carbon layer. As a result, more active sites can be created and an enhanced ORR catalytic activity can be anticipated.

To demonstrate the electrochemical performance of the prepared samples, cyclic voltammetry (CV) tests were tested in 0.1 M KOH aqueous electrolyte. **Figure S5a** demonstrated the curves in the Ar or O<sup>2</sup> saturated electrolyte, and the difference between the two curves revealed the ORR capability. The samples of CeO2-600, NC-CeO<sup>2</sup> and 0.5Co-NC-CeO<sup>2</sup> showed no cathodic reduction peak in Ar-saturated electrolyte, while obvious cathodic peaks in an O2-saturated electrolyte can be seen. The well-defined cathodic peaks of CeO2-600, NC-CeO<sup>2</sup> and 0.5Co-NC-CeO<sup>2</sup> were at 0.620 V, 0.602 V and 0.827 V (vs. RHE), respectively. Specifically, the shape of the CV curve of 0.5Co-NC-CeO2was similar to that in the reference <sup>40</sup> . The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) at a rotating rate of 1600 rpm in O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH electrolyte was also performed. The corresponding curves of the samples CeO2-600, NC-CeO2, 0.5Co-NC, Co3O4-CeO2, 0.5Co-NC-CeO2, 20% Pt/C were shown in **Figure 4a**. Among the above non-Pt catalysts, the 0.5Co-NC-CeO<sup>2</sup> displayed the best performance, which was highlighted by the more positive onset potential of 875 mV (vs RHE) and half-wave potential of 817 mV (vs RHE), and the highest diffusion-limited current density of 4.72 mA/cm-2 , while 20% Pt/C presented an onset potential of 934 mV (vs RHE), a diffusion limited current density of 5.80 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> and half-wave potential of 850 mV (vs RHE), indicating the performance of the prepared catalyst 0.5Co-NC-CeO<sup>2</sup> is close to that of the commercial Pt/C. This observation can be attributed to the following reasons: one is that the metallic Co nanoparticles not only supply high conductivity but also serve as electron donors to largely create oxygen vacancies in CeO2. The other is that the carbon layer can also provide good conductivity and protect Co nanoparticles from oxidation, thus it would lead to its higher ORR activity 41, <sup>42</sup> .

To investigate the effect of Co contents on the ORR performance, RDE measurements for the samples of xCo-NC-CeO2(x = 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75 mmol) were proceeded. As shown in **Figure S5b,** the ORR activity for both NC-CeO2, 0.25Co-NC-CeO<sup>2</sup> and 0.75Co-NC-CeO<sup>2</sup> samples were inferior compared to that of 0.5Co-NC-CeO2. This can be attributed to the reason that Co can not only increase the electroconductivity, but also introduce charge redistribution between CeO<sup>2</sup> and Co at the interface, which induced abundant oxygen vacancies, being beneficial for oxygen sorption. In previous reports, the electronic interactions between CeO<sup>2</sup> and Co at the interface has been calculated by DFT (density function theory), and the results evidenced the increased oxygen absorption, which is beneficial for improved ORR activity [15](#page-3-1) . In addition, to investigate the effect of carbonization temperatures on the ORR performance, the sample 0.5Co-NC-CeO<sup>2</sup> was treated at 700, 800, 900 and 1000 °C, respectively. Among them, 0.5Co-NC-CeO2-800 °C exhibited the best performance, as shown in **Figure S5c**. This may be attributed to the proper carbonization temperature, which produced more Ce3+ content owing to the reductive environment at 800 °C <sup>25</sup> . Thus, 0.5Co and 800 °C were found to be the optimized synthesis parameters for the composite catalyst.

Additionally, to investigate the effect of different metals on the ORR performance, the samples 0.5M-NC-CeO<sup>2</sup> (M = Cu, Ni, Fe, Co) were proceeded, which also explained the universality of this method. As presented in **Figure S5d**, 0.5Co-NC-CeO2presented the best performance, attributing to the synergistic effect among Co, CeO<sup>2</sup> and nitrogen doped carbon layer. Based on the Koutecky-Levich (K-L) equation, the transfer number n of 0.5Fe-NC-CeO<sup>2</sup> and 0.5Co-NC-CeO<sup>2</sup> were calculated to be 3.72 and 3.97, respectively, as shown in **Figure S6**. The highest electron transfer number of 0.5Co-NC-CeO<sup>2</sup> signified the strong interactions between CeO2, N-doped carbon layer and the Co nanoparticles, which indicated its good electrocatalytic performance. In addition, the obvious cathodic peaks in an O2-saturated electrolyte can be seen in **Figure S7**. The well-defined cathodic peaks of 0.5M-NC-CeO<sup>2</sup> (M = Ni, Co, Fe, Cu) were at 0.645 V, 0.827 V, 0.708 V and 0.583 V (vs. RHE), respectively. The peak position of Co-NC-CeO<sup>2</sup> was the closest one to that of Pt/C, which also indicates its good ORR performance.

The LSV curves of 0.5Co-NC-CeO<sup>2</sup> at various rotating rates are shown in **Figure 4b**, while the curves for the series of the other samples are shown in **Figure S8**. Based on the Koutecky-Levich (K-L) equation, the corresponding plots of j-1 versus ω -1/2 at potential of 0.4 V (vs RHE) were shown in **Figure 4c**, from which the ORR kinetics was estimated. The K-L plots presented the linearity and parallelism characteristics, indicating the first-order reaction kinetics toward the electron transfer numbers n. In addition, the transfer number n of 0.5Co-NC-CeO2and 20% Pt/C were calculated to be 3.97 and 4.07. The electron transfer number n can also be calculated based on the ring and disk currents in the RRDE experiment. As shown in **Figure S9**, the HO<sup>2</sup> - yield and the value of n of the sample 0.5Co-NC-CeO<sup>2</sup> were both comparable to those of 20% Pt/C. And it corresponded to the results of K-L plots based on the RDE measurements.

(b) LSV curves of 0.5Co-NC-CeO<sup>2</sup> in O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH aqueous solution at various rotation rates. (c) Koutecky-Levich plots of 0.5Co-NC-CeO<sup>2</sup> and 20% Pt/C at 0.4 V (vs RHE). (d) LSV curves of 0.5Co-NC-CeO<sup>2</sup> before and after 1000 cycles at 1600 rpm.

The electrocatalytic stability and the durability of 0.5Co-NC-CeO<sup>2</sup> were investigated by cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry measurements. As shown in **Figure 4d**, after 1000 continuous cycles, the half-wave potential exhibited a negative shift of 17 mV. Additionally, as shown in **Figure S10,** chronoamperometric test was conducted to evaluate its tolerance to methanol. With 10 mL methanol (24.68 M) adding into the 0.1 M O2-saturated KOH electrolyte of 200 mL at 180 s, almost no current decay in the sample 0.5Co-NC-CeO<sup>2</sup> was observed, while a sharp current decrease (only 71% retention) was observed for 20% Pt/C. This further demonstrates the sample had long-term stability and strong tolerance against methanol poisoning. To demonstrate the advantages of our prepared 0.5Co-NC-CeO2, the ORR performances of some very recent CeO2-based catalysts were listed in **Table S2**. The performance here is better than the reported defective CeO2-x@C and CeO<sup>2</sup> nanoflakes/3D graphene in terms of the on-set potential and the half-wave potential. The reported the half-wave potential was 28 mV higher than that of CeO2-Co-NC. However, the synthesis is much simpler here. The performance was also comparable to those of Co3O4-CeO2/KB and CeO2/CePO4/N, P doped carbon composite, which highlighted the synergistic effect among Co, nitrogen doped carbon layer and CeO2.

### **Conclusions**

In summary, we reported a simple complexing-coprecipitation method to synthesize metal-nitrogen doped carbon-CeO<sup>2</sup> for highefficiency and stable oxygen reduction. By altering the content of Co and tuning the heat treatment temperatures, the synergistic effect among Co, nitrogen doped carbon layer and CeO<sup>2</sup> can play an important role in improving the ORR performance of the sample 0.5Co-NC-CeO2, including the cycling stability and the tolerance against methanol poisoning. In addition, the complexing-coprecipitation method in this work can be extensively applied to prepare various metal/metal oxide composites.

### **Experimental**

#### **Materials:**

All chemical reagents were analytically pure and were used as received without further purification, including cerium (III) nitrate hydrate (Ce(NO3)3·6H2O, 99.9%, Aladdin, China), Co(NO3)2·6H2O (99.99%, Aladdin, China), 1, 2, 4, 5-(benzenetetracarboxylic acid) (BTA, >98%, Aladdin, China), dopamine hydrochloride (DA, 98%, Meryer (Shanghai) Chemical Technology Co., Ltd., China), tris(hydroxymethyl) aminomethane (Tris), HCl (wt% = 36.5%) and absolute ethanol (EtOH, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co, Ltd (SCRC)).

#### **Preparation of CeO<sup>2</sup> nanosheets:**

In a typical synthesis, Ce(NO)3·6H2O (1.25 mmol) and BTA (1.25 mmol) were dissolved in 50 mL ethanol and deionized water mixture (V/V = 1:1). The solution was stirred for 30 minutes and kept in oil bath for 1 hour at 80 °C. The white product was obtained by extraction filtration, and was then washed with ethanol and deionized water for several times. At last, the precursor was dried by freeze-drying. The final CeO<sup>2</sup> was obtained by calcining the precursor at 600 °C for 2 h, which was denoted as CeO2- 600.

#### **Synthesis of Co2+** -**PDA**-**CeO<sup>2</sup> nanosheets:**

In a typical synthesis, 50 mg of CeO2-600 nanosheets were dispersed in 50 mL Tris-HCl solution (pH = 8.5, 50 mM) and ultrasonicated for 1

hour to form a uniform suspension. Then 0.5 mmol of Co(NO3)2·6H2O and 100 mg of DA were added and kept stirring for 12 h at room temperature. The precipitate was separated and washed with ethanol and deionized water for several times. At last, the 0.5Co2+ -PDA-CeO<sup>2</sup> precursor was dried by freeze-drying. The other products such as xCo2+ -PDA-CeO2(x = 0.25, 0.75mmol), PDA-CeO2, and 0.5Co2+ -PDA were synthesized via the same process.

#### **Synthesis of Co**-**NC**-**CeO<sup>2</sup> nanosheets**

The Co2+ -PDA-CeO2precursors were carbonized at 800 <sup>o</sup>C for 2 h in Ar at a rate of 5 °C/min and a flow of 150 sccm to obtain Co-NC-CeO2. For comparison, Co3O4-CeO<sup>2</sup> was obtained by directly heating the precursor at 800 <sup>o</sup>C in air. The other products xCo2+ -PDA-CeO2(x = 0.25, 0.75mmol), PDA-CeO2, and 0.5Co2+ -PDA were carbonized to obtain xCo-NC-CeO2(x = 0.25, 0.75mmol), NC-CeO<sup>2</sup> and 0.5Co-NC.

#### **Electrochemical Characterization**

All the electrochemical measurements were conducted in a threeelectrode configuration under a 0.1 M KOH electrolyte at room temperature, in which the samples were directly used as working electrodes, the SCE (saturated calomel electrode) filled with saturated KCl solution served as reference electrode, and a platinum plate served as counter electrode, respectively. The potentials vs SCE could be converted to vs RHE according to the Nernst equation: ERHE = ESCE + 0.059 pH + 0.241 V.

The preparation of working electrodes, CV and LSV measurements, conversion of Kouteckey-Levich plots, and calculations of peroxide yield (H2O2%) and electron transfer number (n) are described in detail.

The working electrode slurry was prepared by dispersing 5.0 mg sample in the 500 µL of 0.5 % Nafion solution. After sonicating for 30 mins 10 µL of the suspension was casted on the glass carbon electrode (GCE) with a diameter of 5 mm and then dried naturally. Prior to test, Ar/O<sup>2</sup> flow was poured into the electrolyte for at least 30 mins, and the sample was activated at 50 mV/s from -1.0 V to 0.1 V (vs. SCE) until the cyclic voltammetry (CVs) are repeatable. All LSV (Linear Sweep Voltammetry) curves were collected at 10 mV/s at various rotation rates from 400 to 2025 rpm (rounds pre minutes). Kouteckey-Levich plots presenting the linear relation between j-1 and ω-1/2 were obtained based on the following equations:

$$j^{-1} = j_L^{-1} + j_k^{-1} = B^{-1} w^{-\frac{1}{2}} + j_k^{-1}$$
 (1)  
$$B = 0.2nF c_0 D_0^{\frac{2}{3}} v^{-\frac{1}{6}}$$
 (2)

In which j is the measured current density, j<sup>L</sup> is the diffusion-limiting current density, j<sup>k</sup> is the kinetic current density, ω is the rotation rate (rpm), and n is the number of electron transfer. Others are constants: B-1 (slope of K-L plots), F (Faraday constant = 96485 C/mol), C<sup>0</sup> (bulk concentration of O<sup>2</sup> in 0.1 M KOH = 1.2 ×10-3 mol/L), D<sup>0</sup> (diffusion coefficient of O<sup>2</sup> in 0.1 M KOH =1.9 × 10-5 cm<sup>2</sup> /S, and υ (kinematic viscosity of the electrolyte in

#### 0.1 M KOH = 0.01 cm<sup>2</sup> /S).

In addition, rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) was used to precisely evaluate the peroxide yield (H2O2%) and electron transfer number (n), which were calculated from the following equations:

$$H_2 O_2^{0} /_0 = \frac{200 \, I_r / N}{I_d + I_r / N} \tag{3}$$

$$n = \frac{4I_d}{I_d + I_r/N} \tag{4}$$

where I<sup>d</sup> is the disk current, I<sup>r</sup> is the ring current, and N (0.37) is the current collection efficiency of the Pt ring in RDE.

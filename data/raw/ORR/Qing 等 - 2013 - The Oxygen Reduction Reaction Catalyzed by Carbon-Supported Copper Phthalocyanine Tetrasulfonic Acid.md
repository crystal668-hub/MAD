This work reports the preparation and electrochemical property of carbon-supported copper phthaloctyanine tetrasulfonic acid (CuPcTSA/C) for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline media. The catalyst was synthesized via a combined solventimpregnation. For optimizing the electrocatalytic activity, the catalyst obtained at room temperature was further treated at high temperature ranged from 600 to 800<sup>o</sup>C. The catalytic activity was found to be strongly dependent on the heat-treated temperature. Results of electrochemical characterization, which was performed using a rotating disc electrode (RDE) by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and liner sweep voltammetry (LSV), with emphasis on the activity of the catalyst are presented. The resulting CuPcTSA/C-700 of 40/60 mass ratio showed the best catalytic activity in terms of ORR among the overall prepared catalysts, where the onset potential at 0.11V and a half-wave potential at 0.03V were achieved.

## **Introduction**

The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), which dominates the overall electrochemical processes in both fuel cells and metal-air batteries, has drawn great effort in order to improve its catalytic reaction kinetics. Pt has been known to be the best catalyst for the ORR due to its high catalytic activity. However, the high cost and insufficient electrochemical durability of Pt-based catalysts still blocks the better commercialization of fuel cell technology (1-3). Therefore, the current important issue is to look for new non-precious metal alternative catalysts to replace Pt.

Phthalocyanine and its transition metal derivatives have become the hot spot due to their unique metal-N4 macrocyclic structure. Among them Fe- and Co-centered M-Pc complexes are validated for the most promising non-noble metal catalysts (4-6). The most recent studies suggest that other metal-centered phthalocyanine such as CuPc/C are also high active for the ORR when changing the electrolyte from acidic media to alkaline (6,7). In fact, the hydrophilic phthalocyanines, especially the sulfonated derivatives, have attracted much attention as a potential material. Based on this concept, in this work, the carbon-supported copper phthalocyanine tetrasulfonic acid (CuPcTSA/C) was chosen to be as the cathode catalyst for the ORR and its electrocatalytic activity was investigated in alkaline electrolyte. For optimizing the catalytic activity, the catalysts were prepared in a 40:60 mass ratio mixed with Vulcan carbon (Vulcan XC-72R), then were further heat-treated at different temperatures. The catalytic activity was evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) using a rotating disk electrode (RDE) technique.

#### **Experimental**

## Catalyst preparation

The carbon-supported copper phthalocyanine tetrasulfonic acid catalysts (CuPcTSA/C catalyst) were prepared via a combined solvent-impregnation and milling procedure along with high-temperature treatment<sup>7</sup>. The carbon support used in this study was Vulcan XC-72R carbon black (Cabot Corporation,  $S_{BET} = 236.8 \text{m}^2 \text{ g}^{-1}$ ). CuPcTSA was analytically pure and was used as both the metal precursor and nitrogen precursor for the catalysts preparation. In detail, the preparation was processed by combining a mixture of 40mg CuPcTSA and 60mg carbon black in a mortar, milling by adding 10ml methanol for 2h, and then was vacuum-dried at  $40^{\circ}$ C to remove methanol. The resulting powders were further placed in a quartz boat and pyrolyzed at 600, 700 and  $800^{\circ}$ C for 120min, respectively, at a rate of  $20^{\circ}$ C min<sup>-1</sup> in a flowing nitrogen atmosphere.

# Electrochemical testing

The kinetics and electrocatalytic activity of the CuPcTSA/C catalyst were determined using rotating disk electrode (RDE) technique (Glassy carbon electrode with a diameter of 6.0mm corresponding to a geometric surface area of 0.283 cm<sup>-2</sup>, purchased from Pine Instruments). Measurements were conducted in a 0.1M KOH solution. A pre-cleaned rotating disk electrode was coated with catalyst to form the catalyst layer. A mixture of 4.0 mg catalyst and 2.0 ml isopropyl alcohol was ultrasonicated for 10min to dissolve evenly as possible. Then 10 µl of this ink was pipetted onto the GC electrode surface and dried in ambient air. After drying, one drop of methanol/Nafion solution (50:1 wt%) was dropped onto the top of the catalyst layer to improve adhesion during the electrochemical measurement. The overall loading of the catalyst was 71 ug cm<sup>-2</sup>.

The electrochemical measurement was carried out in a standard three compartment electrochemical cell in 0.1 M KOH at room temperature. A glassy carbon electrode (GC, 6 mm in diameter) with the above catalyst ink was used as working electrode. A Pt wire was used as the counter electrode and, a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) was used as a reference electrode. All measured potentials were referenced to the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE). For cyclic voltammetry study, the electrode was scanned at a scan rate of 50 mV s<sup>-1</sup> in the potential range from -0.4 to 0.6V in O<sub>2</sub>saturated 0.1M KOH solution. For linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) study, which can better quantitative of ORR activity, the potential range was between -0.4 and 0.3V in O<sub>2</sub>saturated 0.1M KOH solution, and the electrode rotating speed ranged from 300 to 2400 rpm. A slow scan rate of 5 mV s<sup>-1</sup> was used to ensure a steady state in each point of the curve.

## **Results and Discussion**

## CV study

Figure 1 shows the CV responses for ORR on the CuPcTSA/C electrode measured in O<sub>2</sub>-saturated 0.1 M KOH solution, where the CuPcTSA/C was prepared at different heat-treated temperatures. The peak potential ( $E_p$ ) and peak current ( $I_p$ ) for the ORR are given in Table 1. As shown in Fig. 2, both the peak potential and peak current changed significantly with increasing heat-treatment temperature. The peak current of CuPcTSA/C-700 (-1.18 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>) is obviously higher than that of CuPcTSA/C without heat-treatment (-0.39 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>), CuPcTSA/C-600 (-0.65 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>) and CuPcTSA/C-800 (-0.54 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>). It is noted that the activity of CuPcTSA/C towards ORR is much enhanced after CuPcTSA/C was heat-treated at 700°C considering both the peak potential and peak current density.

Figure 1. Cyclic voltammograms of CuPcTSA/C in  $O_2$ -saturated 0.1M KOH at room temperature. The potential scan rate was 50mV s<sup>-1</sup>. Insert: the structure of CuPcTSA.

Further from Table 1, it can be seen more clearly that CuPcTSA/C-700 shows a peak potential for oxygen reduction at 0.0 V, which is nearly a 290 mV positive shift compared to CuPcTSA/C without heat-treatment and, 137 mV and 88 mV more positive shift than that of CuPcTSA/C-600 and CuPcTSA/C-800, respectively. On the other hand, the CuPcTSA/C-600 shows higher current density than CuPcTSA/C-800, however, the latter gives a peak potential of 50 mV more positive shift than the former. The above results indicate that the optimal heat-treatment temperature for catalyst preparation is around 700°C.

#### LSV study

In order to further clarifying the characteristics of the electrocatalytic activity for the ORR, LSV was carried out in O<sub>2</sub>-saturated 0.1M KOH solution by rotating disk electrode

technique. Figure 2 shows the ORR polarization curves of the CuPcTSA/C synthesized before and after heat treatment, which were measured in O<sub>2</sub>-saturated 0.1M KOH at room temperature. It can be seen that CuPcTSA/C without heat-treatment shows the onset potential at -0.1V with half-wave potential at -0.2V. However, the electrocatalytic activity of the catalyst is highly improved after high temperature treatment. The onset potential is positively shifted to 0.06V for the catalyst after heat treatment at the temperature from 600°C (0.05V) to 700°C (0.11V), where the half-wave potential can be observed to increase from -0.13V to 0.03V. However, additional high temperature treatment, such as at 800°C, leads to a dramatic decrease in the activity. The onset potential is the same as 600°C, and the half-wave potential is 15.4% higher than that of 600°C (-0.13V), both are much lower than that of 700°C (0.03V).

#### RDE measurements

The data of RDE measurements from 300 to 2400 rpm are shown in Figure 3(a). Figure 3(b) shows the Koutecky–Levich plots for the ORR at different potential for CuPcTSA/C catalyst after heat treatment at 700°C. The slope of the plots allows us to check the consistency with the theoretical values according to the following equations (1):

$$\frac{1}{j} = \frac{1}{j_k} + \frac{1}{j_f} + \frac{1}{j_d} - \dots$$
 (1)

where j is the measured current density at given potential,  $j_k$  is the activation controlled current density,  $j_f$  is the effect of Nafion® ionomer inside the catalyst layer on the measured current density, and  $j_d$  is the O<sub>2</sub> diffusion limiting current density.

Due to the  $j_f$  may be negotiable if the equivalent Nafion<sup>®</sup> ionomer thickness is much small  $(j_f \to \infty)$  (8), therefore, its reciprocal can be negligible. In this case, Equation (1) can be simplified to equation (2):

$$\frac{1}{j} = \frac{1}{j_k} + \frac{1}{j_d}$$
 (2)

The  $j_d$  can be expressed as equation (3):

equation (3):  

$$j_d = 0.2 nFC_{O_2} D_{O_2}^{2/3} v^{-1/6} \omega^{1/2} - \dots (3)$$

 where *ω* is the electrode rotation rate (rpm), n the overall electron transfer number per molecule of O2 reduced, F the Faraday's constant (F = 96485C mol-1), *C*o2 is the concentration of dissolved oxygen, *D*o2the diffusion coefficient of oxygen in the bulk solution, ν the kinematic viscosity of the solution.

According to the K-L equation and the results of Fig. 3a, the K-L plots of *j* -1 vs. *ω* -1/2 at fixed six potentials (-0.1V, -0.15V, -0.2V, -0.25V, -0.3V and -0.35V) can be obtained (Fig. 3b). From the slopes of these lines in Fig. 3b, the overall electron transfer number can be estimated, which are 1.97, 1.96, 1.96, 2.02, 2.09 and 2.26, respectively. These values are all close to 2.0, indicating that the ORR catalyzed by CuPcTSA/C-700 catalyst is a two-electron transfer process from O2 to H2O2.

Calculating the electron transfer number (n) for the ORR catalyzed by CuPcTSA/C obtained at various heat-treatment temperatures at potential of -0.35V depend on the slopes of the lines is given in Fig. 4. The electron transfer number in the all reduction process changes with increasing heat-treatment temperature, such as 1.45 for catalyst without heat-treatment, 2.11 for 600, 2.26 for 700, and 1.81 for 800, respectively. This indicates that the electron transfer number of ORR is fairly dependent on the heat treatment temperature from a  $1e^{-1}$  transfer process (9) producing  $O_2^-$  to a  $2e^-$  transfer process producing  $H_2O_2$  with increasing temperature from  $600^{\circ}$ C to  $800^{\circ}$ C, and the highest electron transfer number is obtained at  $700^{\circ}$ C.

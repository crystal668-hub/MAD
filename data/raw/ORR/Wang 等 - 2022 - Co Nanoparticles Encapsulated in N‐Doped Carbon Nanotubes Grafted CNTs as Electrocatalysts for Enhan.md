**The exploration of high-efficiency and inexpensive electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is of critical significance for renewable energy conversion. Herein, an in situ catalytic transformation strategy toward a unique hierarchical nanostructure is reported. In the architecture, Co nanoparticles encapsulated at the tip of bamboo-like N-doped carbon nanotubes (NCNTs) are grafted on N-doped polypyrrole-derived CNTs. Thanks to the smart design of unique 3D architecture, the NPCN@Co-NCNTs catalyst displays an extraordinary ORR activity in 0.1 m KOH solution (the onset and halfwave potentials are 0.96 and 0.90 V vs RHE, respectively), which is similar to commercial Pt/C catalyst (0.99 and 0.88 V vs RHE, respectively). Meanwhile, the catalyst shows the low Tafel slope of 78 mV dec**<sup>−</sup>**<sup>1</sup> and long-time stability. Experimental and theoretical results verify that the improved ORR performance is mainly related to the existence of Co nanoparticles protected by pyridinic-N-doped carbon, which lowers the theoretical overpotential of ORR. Density functional theory calculations reveal that Pyridinic-NCCo site is the reactive site with the lowest overpotential for ORR (0.57 V). These results unambiguously indicate that the NPCN@Co-NCNTs represent a low-cost yet high-efficiency electrocatalyst for the electrocatalytic ORR.**

**1. Introduction**

The exploration and development of high-performance new energy are considered the only way for human beings to overcome the growing global energy crisis. As an energy conversion device, fuel cells possess a set of advantages such as cleanness, high efficiency, and high conversion efficiency, which have been identified as one of the ideal new energy sources in the 21st century.[1,2] Particularly, in fuel cell systems, the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) of the cathode is of paramount importance.[3,4]

Although commercial Pt-based materials are known as the most efficient ORR catalysts, their paucity, exorbitant price, and insufficient stability badly hamper their large-scale applications in commercial fuel cells.[5,6] Therefore, the exploration and design of a low cost, robust, and highly active ORR electrocatalysts becomes significantly imperative.

Over the past several years, several nonprecious electrocatalysts based on nanostructured 3d transition metals (3d TMs) (e.g., Ni, Fe, Co, etc.) and their alloys have been reported to be effective for ORR.[7–9] However, traditional forms of 3d TMs such as bulk or aggregated particles generally do not have a competitive advantage in electrochemical catalysis applications because of their low surface area and few catalytic reaction sites.[10] Besides, the catalytic performances of bare 3d electrode materials under strong alkaline electrolyte and high overpotential are not stable enough. In order to solve

the above problems and obtain better catalytic performances, various strategies have been developed.[11] An effective method recently adopted to improve the electrocatalytic performance of 3d TMs or its alloys is to encapsulate these nanoparticles in a graphene layer or carbon nanotubes (CNTs). The construction of such unique structures can not only effectively protect the metal core from harsh environments, but also accelerate the catalytic reaction thanks to the synergistic effect between carbon materials and 3d TMs.[12–14] Recent studies have demonstrated that hybrid electrocatalysts, TM and heteroatom-doped

(e.g., N, P, etc.) carbonaceous materials, usually exhibit exceptional ORR activities and good stability superior compared to their single-component counterparts. For example, Zhao and co-workers fabricated a highly efficient Fe3C@NCNTs-NCNFs electrocatalyst by the electrospinning technique, in which Fe3C nanoparticles were encapsulated in N-enriched CNTs aligned on nitrogen-doped CNFs.[15] Additionally, the nitrogen doping (CN, CN, FeN) can also induce asymmetrical charge distributions on the adjacent carbon atoms and decrease the energy required for the adsorption of the reactants on the electrocatalyst, thereby improving the catalytic performance. Xia et al. reported the Co-N/PC@CNT-Ts composite catalyst through the pyrolysis of Bio-MOF-11 at different temperatures.[16] They compared different types of nitrogen doping and proved that the synergistic effect of pyridine N (CoNx) and pyrrole N can greatly improve the electrocatalytic activity. Despite some progress has been achieved, there is still a lack of in-depth insights on the underlying catalytic mechanism, in particular, the synergistic effect between metal particles and doped N atoms, as well as the respective contribution of each N configuration to the overall ORR performance.

Based on the above considerations, we propose a facile and scalable method for the synthesis of the high-performance electrocatalyst for ORR. The resulting NPCN@Co-NCNTs composite displays unique 3D hierarchical architecture, composed of Co nanoparticles encapsulated in nitrogen-enriched CNTs grafted polypyrrole (PPy)-derived nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (NPCN). Unexpectedly, the NPCN@Co-NCNTs catalyst exhibits superior electrocatalytic performances including halfwave potential up to 0.90 V and long durability. Experimental and theoretical investigations unveiled that the synergy effect of two different types of CNTs along with high-level N doped Co sites was favorable for oxygen intermediate absorption/desorption, leading to accelerated reaction kinetics and improved catalytic oxygen reduction activity. We also discuss the synergistic effect between metallic Co and doped N atoms, as well as the catalytic mechanism of the contribution of each N configuration to the overall ORR performance.

## **2. Results and Discussion**

**Figure 1** mainly describes the whole preparation process of PPy-derived nitrogen-doped CNs-metallic cobalt nanoparticlescarbon nanotubes (NPCN@Co-NCNTs). First, high-quality PPy nanotubes were fabricated via a typical oxidation method (Figure S1, Supporting Information), followed by annealing at 650 °C under nitrogen atmosphere, and eventually generating the PPy-derived NPCN. Then, the resulting NPCN was used as the internal support to further anchor small Co3O4 nanoparticles onto its surface to yield the NPCN@Co3O4 precursor (Figure S2, Supporting Information). In the subsequent annealing process, the NPCN@Co3O4 precursor was reduced to Co nanoparticles by the pyrolysis product of melamine. Melamine served as both a nitrogen source and a carbon source for the formation of N-doped CNTs, and NPCN@Co3O4 not only acted as a cobalt source but also provided catalytically active sites to catalyze the formation of N-doped CNTs. During the pyrolysis process, melamine decomposed into CN groups, accompanied by the generation of reduced gases, and the continuously flowing N2 atmosphere converted Co3O4 into Co nanocrystal catalysts. Meanwhile, thanks to the catalytic effect of Co nanoparticles, the CN groups were rearranged to form bamboo-like N-doped CNTs, which grow in situ on the NPCN surface. Apparently, the rational construction of such a fascinating hierarchical heterostructure could increase the surface area and mass transfer channels, expose more accessible active sites, and enhance the electron transfer capability.[17,18]

**Figure 2**a–c shows the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images with different magnifications of the NPCN@ Co-NCNTs composite. It can be clearly seen that the product displays a uniform, well-defined morphology and unique 1D tubular structure. And the whole tube has a relatively coarse surface with a length of about 2.5 µm and a diameter of 200–250 nm (Figure 2a,b). Through magnified SEM observation from Figure 2c, lots of relatively short CNTs with length range from about 300 to 500 nm are rooted from the surface of NPCNs, giving rise to a unique 3D hierarchical architecture. Moreover, the small Co nanoparticles with the average size of 24 nm are found to reside at the tip of these short CNTs (inset in Figure 2c). Typical transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images (Figure 2d) were used to further verify the delicate microstructure of NPCN@Co-NCNTs. Clearly, High-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image (Figure 2e,f) further revealed that every Co nanoparticle is tightly encapsulated into CNTs-grafted NPCN, matching with the SEM findings. Furthermore, the preparation of uniformly dispersed Co-NCNTs is extremely difficult without the addition of NPCN (Figure S3, Supporting Information). Figure 2f clearly shows distinct lattice fringes with d spacings of 0.205 and 0.36 nm, which are in good agreement with the (111) and (002) lattice planes of metallic cobalt and graphite carbon. The corresponding selected-area electron diffraction pattern shows scattered dots that can be assigned to the (220), (111), (200), and (311) planes of metallic cobalt, respectively (Figure S4, Supporting Information). Figure 2g–j shows the elemental distribution and composition of NPCN@ Co-NCNTs. The as-made hybrid contains Co, C, and N elements, consisting of the EDX analysis (Figure S5, Supporting Information).

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was then conducted to discern the chemical states and composition of NPCN@ Co-NCNTs. The main elements including Co, C, and N appear in the XPS survey scanning spectrum of NPCN@Co-NCNTs (Figure S6, Supporting Information), which is in line with the elemental mapping results. The high-resolution Co 2p spectrum presented in **Figure 3**a can be deconvoluted into two doublets corresponding to metallic Co (777.8 and 793.5 eV) and Co2<sup>+</sup> (780.5 and 796.3 eV). In addition, two broad peaks at 785.5 and 802.6 eV are assigned to the satellite peaks.[19] The C 1s spectrum indicates the existence of CC, CN, CN, and OCO bonds in the composite (Figure 3b).[20–22] The chemical status of the dopant N is further revealed by the high-resolution N 1s spectra. As can be seen from Figure 3c, the spectrum can be differentiated into four subpeaks, which correspond to pyridinic N (content: 36.3 wt.%, binding energy: 398.5 eV), pyrrolic N (15.1 wt.%, 400.1 eV), graphitic N (33.8 wt.%, 401.1 eV), and oxidic N (14.8 wt.%, 403.4 eV), respectively.[23–25] The result proves the successful doping of nitrogen, and the total N content is determined to be about 5.0 at.% in the NPCN@Co-NCNTs. Such a relatively high N-doping is mainly induced by the N-rich precursor NPCN and melamine. Specifically, some studies have demonstrated that pyridinic N species will be a positive effect on improving the ORR performance.

The successful transition of crystal phases from Co3O4 to Co has been affirmed by the X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique (Figure 3d). For NPCN@Co-NCNTs and Co-NCNTs samples, their common peaks located at 44.2°, 51.4°, and 75.5° are indexed to the (111), (200), and (220) crystal facets of metallic Co (JCPDS No. 15–0806).[26,27] Before the pyrolysis process, there are four characteristic peaks center at 31.3°, 36.8°, 44.8°,

59.4°, and 65.2°, corresponding well to (220), (311), (400), (511), and (440) planes of Co3O4 (JCPDS 43–1003).[28] Noticeably, all three samples appear a big broad peak at about 26°, which can be ascribed to the (002) crystal plane of amorphous carbon materials. Figure 3e and Figure S7, Supporting Information, present the N2 absorption-desorption isotherms of three samples, NPCN@Co-NCNTs has a larger specific surface area of 73 m2 g−<sup>1</sup> than those of NPCN@Co3O4 and Co-NCNTs. This relatively high surface area mainly comes from the construction of such a unique 3D hierarchical architecture. Based on the TGA result obtained in an air atmosphere (Figure 3f), the weight percentage of Co in the NPCN@Co-NCNTs composite is determined to be around 21.6%.[29] The detailed calculation process can be found in Supporting Information.

The catalytic performance of the NPCN@Co-NCNTs catalyst toward ORR was initially investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements in 0.1 m KOH electrolyte. As displayed in **Figure 4**a, Figures S8 and S9, Supporting Information, there are obvious cathodic ORR peaks for three samples in O2-saturated environment. However, no obvious peaks were seen in the N2 saturated environment, indicating that these catalysts have a certain catalytic activity for ORR. Among them,

the NPCN@Co-NCNTs catalyst gives the most positive reduction peak at 0.73 V versus RHE in comparison to those of Co-NCNTs (0.70 V) and NPCN@Co3O4 (0.63 V), showing the best electrocatalytic performance for ORR.[30]

To further compare the ORR activity of three catalysts, LSV tests were also performed at a rotation speed of 1600 rpm in 0.1 m KOH solution. Figure 4b presents the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) polarization curves, where NPCN@Co-NCNTs, Co-NCNTs, NPCN@Co3O4, and commercial Pt/C samples are also studied for comparison.[31] In the mixed kinetic/diffusion region, the ORR activity of the catalysts can be compared via the onset potential (*E*onset) and halfwave potential (*E*1/2). As shown in Figure 4c, one can see that the NPCN@Co-NCNTs catalyst possess an outstanding *E*onset and a high *E*1/2 of about 0.96 and 0.90 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), respectively, which are also quite close to the commercial 20% Pt@C (*E*onset≈0.99 V; *E*1/2≈0.88 V). Furthermore, the results are superior to those of Co-NCNTs (*E*onset≈0.95 V; *E*1/2≈0.87 V) and NPCN@Co3O4 (*E*onset≈0.92 V; *E*1/2≈ 0.76 V). The Tafel slope is generally considered as an indicator of kinetics rate for electrochemical reactions.[32,33] As can be seen from Figure 4d, the Tafel slope of NPCN@Co-NCNTs reaches a value of 78 mV dec<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> , which is much lower than Co-NCNTs (81 mV dec<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> ), NPCN@Co3O4 (86 mV dec<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> ), and Pt/C (98 mV dec<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> ), further verifying the fast kinetics of NPCN@Co-NCNTs.[34,35] The Nyquist plots (Figure S10, Supporting Information) also indicate that the NPCN@Co-NCNTs catalyst shows the smallest charge transfer resistance and exhibits superior ORR activity. Impressively, this superior ORR catalytic activity of the NPCN@ Co-NCNTs catalyst developed in our work has outperformed most of the electrocatalysts previously reported. (Table S1, Supporting Information).

To gain a deep insight into the electrocatalytic activity and reaction kinetics of NPCN@Co-NCNTs towards ORR, the LSV curves on RDE were recorded at various rotating rates from 100 to 3600 rpm in the 0.1 m KOH solution (Figure 4e). Typically, the diffusion limiting current density increases with increasing rotating speed due to the short diffusion distance at the high speed. The electron transfer number (n) per O2 involved in ORR can be derived from the corresponding Koutecky–Levich (K–L) plots at various potentials.[36] The electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) was reflected from the double-layer capacitance (*C*dl), which can be obtained by CV with different scan rates from 5 to 25 mV s−<sup>1</sup> in a non-faradic potential range in 0.1 m KOH (Figure S11, Supporting Information). The *C*dl of NPCN@ Co-NCNTs catalyst (10.3 mF cm−<sup>2</sup> ) is higher than that of Co-NCNTs (7.67 mF cm<sup>−</sup>2) and NPCN@Co3O4 (6.31 mF cm−<sup>2</sup> ). The largest ECSA further indicates that the NPCN@Co-NCNTs catalyst demonstrates excellent electrocatalytic activity for ORR. As illustrated in Figure 4f, the K–L plots display excellent linearity and close coincidence, demonstrating similar electron transfer numbers for ORR. Based on the K–L equation, the values of electron transfer numbers per O2 are calculated to be 3.98, 3.93, 3.89, 3.99, and 3.95 at the potentials of 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, and 0.7 V, respectively, close to the theoretical value of 4.0. The results suggest that the ORR reaction catalyzed by NPCN@Co-NCNTs is mainly based on the four-electron transfer process.[37]

As presented in Figure 4g and Figure S12, Supporting Information, of rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE) test, the ring current ascribed to the H2O2 oxidation is significantly lower than the disk current assigned to oxygen reduction, manifesting the predominant product of OH<sup>−</sup>. The monitored n is above 3.8 and peroxide percentage is below 7% for NPCN@Co-NCNTs nanocomposite over the potential range of 0.2–0.75 V. These results further reveal that the catalytic process at NPCN@Co-NCNTs electrode undergoes a four-electron ORR pathway, indicating its high ORR catalytic efficiency. The current density of NPCN@Co-NCNTs does not show obvious change after the introduction of 3 mL methanol (Figure S13, Supporting Information), whereas a sharp drop occurs for Pt/C, demonstrating the NPCN@Co-NCNTs with a decent property of methanol tolerance. Moreover, the chronoamperometric measurements (Figure 4h) show that the as-fabricated NPCN@Co-NCNTs catalyst has a much higher stability compared with the commercial Pt/C catalyst. After 74 000 s continuous operations, the NPCN@Co-NCNTs catalyst exhibits only a slight loss of current density (7.2%), whereas the reduced current density of Pt/C is up to 25.7% in the same time.[4] This result is also further confirmed by comparing the 1st and 1000th LSV curves (Figure 4i). After 1000 continuous cycles, the *E*1/2 of NPCN@Co-NCNTs is maintained well with only a negative shift of 10 mV, demonstrating its outstanding durability.[38] Observed from the TEM image (Figure S14, Supporting Information), the NPCN@Co-NCNTs catalyst retains its original morphology and relatively good microstructure after 1000th cycles. Such an excellent stability of NPCN@Co-NCNTs is primarily ascribed to the robust framework structure composed of interconnected NPCN and NCNTs.

To identify the effect of nitrogen doping, especially different types of nitrogen doping on the ORR catalytic performance, we further carry out the theoretical simulations on Pyridinic-N, Pyrrolic-N, Graphitic-N doped carbon, and pure carbon supported by Co (111) substrate. After the structure optimization, it is found that the graphene layer can maintain well on the Co substrate due to the small lattice mismatch (< 1.5%) between graphene and Co. Meanwhile, from optimized structure, the layer distance is calculated to be 2.20 Å, which is in good agreement with the previous study.[39] The small layer interface suggests the strong coupling effect between graphene and Co substrate, which can modulate the binding effect of oxygenated species, thus further tuning the ORR activity. Then, four optimized model structures of catalysts are used to investigate their ORR reaction mechanism as shown in **Figure 5** and Figure S15, Supporting Information. First, one oxygen molecule reacts with one water molecule to form \*OOH group on the active site with one OH− ion transferred. Then, the produced \*OOH intermediate dissociates into \*O group, and another OH− group is transferred into the electrolyte. The next step is the \*O intermediate interacts with another water molecule to produce the adsorbed \*OH species. Finally, the \*OH intermediate further dissociates into OH− ion, closing the ORR circle. From the Gibbs free energy change diagrams, the potential determining step (PDS) turns to be the first elementary step of the formation of \*OOH group for all four catalysts, that is, (\* + O2 (g) + H2O (l) + e<sup>−</sup> → OOH\* + OH−). Among all the calculated models, Pyridinic-NCCo exhibits the lowest value of Δ*G*PDS, and the obtained overpotential (*η*) is only 0.57 V, which is much lower than other N doped catalysts, such as Pyrrolic NCCo

## **3. Conclusion**

In summary, a facile in situ chemical transformation strategy has been developed toward a unique 3D architecture consisting of Co nanoparticles encapsulated bamboo-like N-doped CNTs grown onto PPy-derived NCNTs. Benefiting from the confinement and synergy effect of two different types of CNTs along with high-level N doping, the as-made NPCN@Co-NCNTs catalyst exhibits an outstanding ORR activity with positive *E*1/2 of 0.9 V and better durability than the benchmark Pt/C catalyst in alkaline media. Theoretical calculation analysis indicates that Co nanoparticles protected by pyridinic-N-doped graphene carbon display the lowest overpotential of 0.57 V than pyrrolic-N-doped graphene (0.91 V) and graphitic-N-doped graphene (0.94 V). Additionally, the ratio or proportion of N species can be further tuned by selecting suitable nitrogen precursors, changing the amounts of nitrogen sources or the calcination temperature/time, and so on. This present study not only offers a feasible route to design 3D TM/carbon nanohybrids, but also inspires new thoughts on the development of high-performance noble-metal-free catalysts for more energy conversion and storage systems.

## **4. Experimental Section**

*Chemical Reagents*: All the chemical reagents in the experiments were obtained from commercial sources as guaranteed-grade reagents and used without further purification. Melamine was bought from Alfa Aesar Chemicals Co., Ltd. Pyrrole monomer was from Shanghai Aladdin Bio-Chem Technology Co., Ltd. Cobalt (Ⅱ) acetate tetrahydrate (Co(AC)2 4H2O, urea (CO(NH2)2), hexamethylenetetramine (HMTA), and ethanol were provided by Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Distilled water was used in all the experiments.

*Synthesis of NPCN@Co*3*O*4 *Precursor*: The PPy-derived NPCN was first prepared by an oxidation method based on the previous work.[40] Then, NPCN@Co3O4 precursors were synthesized through a facile hydrothermal process. 20 mg of NPCN obtained was first dispersed into 40 mL of ethanol by ultrasonication for 1 h. Afterwards, 36 mg of HMTA and 30 mg of urea were added into the above suspension and kept stirring for 1 h to form a homogenous solution. Then, 120 mg of Co(AC)2 4H2O was further added, and the mixture solution was stirred for another 1 h. After that, the resulting solution was transferred into a 100 mL of Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and reacted at 120 °C for 12 h in an oven. After the autoclave cooled down naturally to room temperature, the obtained black precipitate was harvested by centrifugation, washed thoroughly with deionized water and ethanol, and dried in a vacuum at 60 °C overnight to achieve NPCN@Co3O4 precursor product.

*Synthesis of NPCN@Co-NCNTs*: In a typical procedure, 5 mg of NPCN@Co3O4 precursor obtained from the above procedure and 250 mg of melamine were placed in two separated positions in a porcelain crucible, where melamine was located at the upstream site of the furnace. It was then heated to 900 °C for 2 h with a heating rate of 5 °C min−<sup>1</sup> in a flowing nitrogen atmosphere. After cooling to ambient temperature, the final NPCN@Co-NCNTs product was collected.

Additionally, the control Co-NCNTs product was also prepared as follows:[41] Briefly, 0.5 g of Co(AC)2·4H2O was placed into a porcelain boat, and the mixture was placed in a muffle furnace at 900 °C with a heating rate of 5 °C min−<sup>1</sup> for 2 h. Next, the 0.1 g of as-prepared cobalt oxides and 1.5 g of melamine were placed in two separated positions in a porcelain crucible. Subsequently, the samples were heated at 900 °C for 2 h in a tube furnace in nitrogen atmosphere with a heating rate of 5 °C min−<sup>1</sup> , and melamine was located upstream of the gas stream.

*Materials Characterizations*: The phase composition and purity of the products were detected by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns on the Japan Rigakul D/max-2550 instrument using CuK*α* radiation (*λ* = 0.154 nm). The detailed microstructure of the products was examined through the SEM (JEOL S4800), TEM (Hitachi HT7700), and highresolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, JEM-F2000). Elemental qualitative analysis was collected in the energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX, OXFORD INCA). XPS was obtained on the Kratos Analytical Axis Ultra DLD spectrometer with MgK*α* X-ray

Electrochemical Measurements: The electrocatalytic activity of the catalysts toward ORR was tested in a three-electrode configuration using a rotating disk electrode (RDE, Pine Research Instrumentation) with a CHI 760E potentiostat in an oxygen-saturated 0.1 м КОН solution. A glassy carbon (GC) electrode with a surface area of 0.196 cm<sup>2</sup> served as the substrate for the working electrode. The graphite rod and Ag/ AgCl (saturated KCl) were used as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively. To prepare catalyst ink, 5 mg of the catalyst was dispersed into 970 µL ethanol containing 30 µL 5% Nafion (D520, Dupont Inc., USA), followed by ultrasonication for 30 min. Then, 10 µL of the catalyst ink was deposited on a GC for all samples including commercial Pt/C (20 wt.%, Johnson Matthey). LSV measurements of the catalysts were determined using an RDE. The rotating speed of working electrode varied from 100 to 3600 rpm with a scan rate of 5 mVs<sup>-1</sup>. The number of electrons transferred (n) during ORR was calculated by K-L equation, at various electrode potentials:

where J is the measured current density,  $J_{\rm K}$  and  $J_{\rm L}$  are the kinetic and diffusion-limiting current densities,  $\omega$  is the angular velocity, n is transferred electron number, F is the Faraday constant (96 485C mol<sup>-1</sup>),  $C_0$  is the bulk concentration of  $O_2$  (1.2 × 10<sup>-6</sup> mol cm<sup>-3</sup>),  $D_0$  is the diffusion coefficient of  $O_2$  in 0.1 m KOH and 0.1 m HClO<sub>4</sub> (1.9 × 10<sup>-5</sup>cm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>), and  $\nu$  is the kinematic viscosity of the electrolyte (0.01 cm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>). The specific kinetic current density can be calculated from the followed equation:

$$J_{K} = \frac{J_{L} \times J}{J_{L} - J} \tag{3}$$

Rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) measurements were carried out to determine the selectivity of the four-electron. The disk electrode was scanned at a rate of 5 mV s $^{-1}$ , and the ring electrode potential was set to 1.2 V versus RHE. The hydrogen peroxide yield ( $\%H_2O_2$ ) and the electron transfer number (n) were calculated by the following equations:

$$\%H_2O_2 = 200 \frac{i_r / N}{i_d + i_r / N}$$
 (4)

$$n = 4 \frac{i_d}{i_d + i_r / N} \tag{5}$$

where  $i_d$  and  $i_r$  are the disk and ring currents, respectively. N is the ring current collection efficiency, which was determined to be 0.37.

Computational Methods: Density functional theory (DFT) as implemented in the Vienna Ab-initio Simulation Package (VASP) with the projector augmented waves methods was employed for structural optimization. [42–45] The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) method was performed to describe the exchange-correlation. [46] Longrange van der Waals dispersion was also considered by using empirical correction in Grimme's scheme. [47] A cut-off energy of 500 eV for plain-wave basis sets was adopted and the convergence threshold was  $10^{-5}$  eV, and  $5\times10^{-3}$  eV Å $^{-1}$  for energy and force, respectively. A slab of three atomic Co (111) layers with the last two layer fixed, and each layer contained  $6\times6$  unit cell was chosen to support the graphene layer, which also consisted of  $6\times6$  unit cell. The vacuum space was set to more than 15 Å, which was enough to avoid the interaction between periodical images.

The Gibbs free energy changes ( $\Delta G$ ) for each elementary steps were calculated based on the computational hydrogen electrode model proposed by Norskov et al., which was determined by the following equation:

$$\Delta G = \Delta E + \Delta Z P E - T \Delta S + \Delta G_{IJ} + \Delta G_{pH}$$
(6)

where  $\Delta E$  denotes the electronic energy change,  $\Delta ZPE$  is the correction of zero-point energies (ZPE), T is the temperature of 298.15 K, and  $\Delta S$  is the change in entropy.  $\Delta$   $G_U=-eU$  is the contribution of electrode potential to  $\Delta G$ , and  $\Delta$   $G_{\rm pH}=-k_{\rm B}T \ln 10^{\rm *} {\rm pH}.$

Abstract: Hitherto, a series of issues have been caused by the extensive use of volatile and toxic organic solvents in organics and polymers synthesis, i. e., the increased production costs and irreversible damage to the environment. Hence, it is necessary to pioneer a synthesis method that is green, safe and efficient to the sustainable development of society. Herein, a facile and controllable, but, rational and effective in situ solid-phase synthesis method was developed to prepare a silica-templated Fe-phthalocyanine-based porous organic polymer (POP), which can be further converted into an iron and nitrogen codoped porous carbon (HS-Phth-Fe-900) upon carbonization and template removal. This innovative approach simultaneously provides a means to control the surface features, thereby tuning the catalytic property of obtained materials. The final HS-Phth-Fe-900 with hierarchical pore structure exhibits hollow hemispheric morphology, large pore volume and surface area, significantly improving the mass transfer efficiency and promoting the accessibility of the active sites, achieving a high ORR activity in alkaline media (0.1 M KOH). HS-Phth-Fe-900 presents a competitive half-wave potential of 0.823 V and limiting current of 4.887 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> (vs. 0.833 V and 5.621 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> for Pt/C) far beyond the catalysts prepared free of template (Phth-Fe-900). Furthermore, it also exhibits super long-time stability and methanol immunity surpassing the benchmark Pt/C in 0.1 M KOH. That may open up new possibilities for the rational design and massive preparation of POPs-derived materials for electrochemical applications.

#### Introduction

The ever aggravated global issues caused by the excessive consumption of fossil fuels have stimulated the development of renewable energy. Hence, design and preparation of advanced materials for energy storage and conversion is very essential towards a sustainable future. Hitherto, a great number of materials especially the nanostructured porous carbonaceous materials have been extensively studied. And among these materials, due to the features of low-cost, excellent activity and high stability, the metal nitride, metal carbide together with the complex of metal nitride and metal carbide, for example the Fe/Fe<sub>3</sub>C doped FeNx, have always been considered as

promising candidates for energy storage and conversion devices.<sup>4</sup> Iron, as most abundant transition metal element on earth, is considered to be the most valuable element for chemical research. However, the electrochemical performance largely depends on the structure and morphology of prepared materials.<sup>5</sup> Generally speaking, a fine structure contributed to a huge promotion to the final performance of prepared materials. Hence, widespread attention have been attracted to develop novel materials with super structure, i. e., fibers, nanotubes, nanocubes, nanosheets, nanobelts, nanoflowers and nanoshells, bringing extra benefits to the performance of materials.<sup>6</sup> Therefore, for full demonstration of the advantages of catalysts, it is quite essential to achieve the accurate control of material morphology.<sup>7</sup>

Hollow and semi-hollow structure, owing to the unique structural features, has always been considered as a desirable morphology in many cases. The hollow structure could afford a low skeleton density and large specific surface areas, simultaneously, which is favorable for the accommodation of guest contents, so it could be used as the substrate both anchoring and exposing the active sites relevant to catalytic process, hence, promoting the transport properties of materials and realizing the specific function for a further step.<sup>8</sup> Furthermore, the porous carbon based materials with hollow mesoporous structures could accelerate the electrolyte infiltration and promote the mass transfer during the catalytic process, further improving the ORR activity. It has been extensive studied in batteries, electrocatalysis and drug delivery.<sup>9</sup>

Template-assisted synthesis strategy affords a controllable method for the preparation of materials with hollow structure. 10 However, many insufficiency are still existed. For the one hand, the hollow shell is formed by the high temperature pyrolysis of the reaction monomers, for which the yield is always low; and in the most cases, it is a mathematical stochastic combination of chemical elements. For the other hand, stacking effect are widely existed during carbonization which could lead to uncontrollable morphology, limited the catalytic activity of prepared materials greatly.11 Hence, it is urgent to develop a novel method for controllable preparation of hollow porous structure. Porous organic polymers (POPs) represent an emerging generation of multi-function materials. 12 Beyond other well-established porous materials, such as graphene, CNTs, activated carbons, metal organic frameworks, POPs are currently in the focus of research. They excel because of the specificity of organic reactions and the modular bottom-up building concept which allows for tailoring the structure and properties of materials towards desired applications by using purely organic building blocks. The specificity of organic reactions makes the composition of polymers controllable precisely at the atomic level. Hitherto, great attention has been attracted and great progress has been achieved in the design

and preparation of POPs.<sup>13</sup> It has been extensively applied in gas storage, catalysis, optoelectronics and energy storage.<sup>14</sup> Recent reports have demonstrated that porous organic polymers is an ideal precursor for the preparation of heteroatoms or metal

Recent reports have demonstrated that porous organic polymers is an ideal precursor for the preparation of heteroatoms or metal doped porous carbon.<sup>15</sup> It will be a wise choice that prepare POPs with the assist of template, realizing the effective control of polymer morphology and composition.

Hitherto, tremendous efforts were dedicated to the development of tailored porous organic materials. However, just akin to the synthesis of other organics and polymers, the vast usage of volatile and toxic organic solvents is inevitable for the preparation of most POPs. And a series of issues have been caused by the extensive use of organic solvents, i. e., the increased production costs and irreversible damage to the environment. Furthermore, most of the POPs are prepared in organic solvent, but the template are insoluble in the organic solvent. It is difficult to form a nano-layer between the solid and liquid phases. <sup>16</sup> Hence, pioneering a synthesis method that is green, safe and efficient to the sustainable development of society is very essential.

Herein, a facile and controllable, but, rational and effective template-assisted in situ solid-phase synthesis method was developed for the preparation of POPs. Compared with solvent synthesis, solid-phase synthesis enables the formation of the polymer nano-layer under homogeneous conditions.<sup>17</sup> Via this method, a high-efficient and durable Fe-based electrocatalyst (HS-Phth-Fe-900) with hollow hemispheric structure was massive prepared. Different with previous reports, the nanoshell was obtained using metal-phthalocyanine-based porous polymer as the nanoshell and SiO2 as the template, following by direct carbonization at 900°C and subsequently chemical etching. Furthermore, other materials with controllable structures and morphology, such as ZIF-67, ZIF-8, HKUST, could also serve as the template for the preparation of hollow and well-defined structure, i.e., sphere-like, rod-like or even cube. This novel method simultaneously provides a means to control the surface features, pore structure and thereby tuning the catalytic property of the material. The porous shells and hollow substrates endow these materials available in various energy related aspects.

#### **Results and Discussion**

The iron-phthalocyanine-based conjugated porous networks were prepared via template-assisted (SiO $_2$  sphere) in situ solid phase synthesis method (Figure 1). In brief, the polymer nanoshell were prepared by mixing pyromellitic dianhydride, urea, (NH $_4$ ) $_2$ Mo $_2$ O $_7$  and pre-synthesized template with FeCl $_2\cdot 4$ H $_2$ O simultaneously. Then, the mixture was grinded evenly and then transferred into a muffle and heated to 220°C at the rate of 5°C min $^{-1}$  and kept for 3 h. After cooling to room temperature, the product was washed with water, acetone, and methanol. The precipitates were dried under vacuum at 70°C overnight, then pyrolyzed at 900°C for 3 h by 5°C/min under Ar. Subsequently, the mixture was washed by 1.0 M H $_2$ SO $_4$ 0 overnight, then the crude sample was dispersed in 20% HF for 2 h to remove the SiO $_2$  thoroughly. The obtained products were then washed with H $_2$ O $_7$ 0 methanol and acetone successively.

Then the sample was carbonized for a second time at the temperature of 900°C obtaining the final product, which is denoted as HS-Phth-Fe-900.

**Figure 1.** Schematic route for the preparation of hollowed porous carbon using the template assisted method.

To validate the successful construction of the porous polyphthalocyanine skeletons, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and solid state <sup>13</sup>C cross-polarization with magic angle spinning spectrum were examined. According to Figure S1, characteristic signals which could certify the formation of the conjugated phthalocyanine skeletons could be clearly observed. Signals belonging to the phthalocyanine are distributed at 1608, 1512, and 1330 cm<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. Furthermore, characteristic stretching vibration bands assignable to the C-N (1285 and 1170 cm-1)18 and chelate Fe-N<sub>4</sub> (902 cm<sup>-1</sup>)<sup>19</sup> could also be clearly detected. The solid state <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectrum are delivered in Figure S2, from which obvious carbon signal (167, 160, 152, 145, 132, and 127 ppm) assigned to the phthalocyanine rings could be found, further revealing the formation of polyphthalocyanine structure.<sup>20</sup>

The morphology and inner structure of prepared products are visualized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). As exhibited in the Figure 2a, different with the catalysts prepared free of template (Phth-Fe-900, Figure S4), the polymer formed via in situ solid-phase polymerization covers the surface of spherical SiO<sub>2</sub> evenly.

obtained from SEM, from which, uniformly distributed Fe, N and C could be clearly detected. The final material (HS-Phth-Fe-900) obtained after carbonization and etching shows an hollow hemispherical structure (Figure 2b, 2c, 2d), indicating the feasibility of the template-assisted method for the preparation of hollow structure. Owing to the catalytic of iron, graphitized stripes which is favourable for the catalytic process could be clearly observed from the high-resolution TEM images (Figure 2e), suggesting the excellent graphitic degree of prepared sample. Besides, clear lattice fringes belonging to the Fe and Fe<sub>3</sub>C species could also be observed in Figure 2e. As marked in Figure 2e, regular interplanar spacing of about 0.30 nm (blue line) ascribed to the (111) planes of Fe<sub>3</sub>C could be detected. Meanwhile, spacing of ~0.20 nm (white line) attributed to the Fe (110) planes could also be observed.21 Figure 2f showed the corresponding SAED pattern. To further confirm the composition of prepared composites, element mapping was conducted to observe the distribution of Fe/Fe<sub>3</sub>C. As presented in Figure S5, iron element are homogeneously distributed over the sample.

Figure 3a shows the powder XRD patterns of the assynthesized catalysts. Different with polymer precursors, prominent graphitic peaks located at 25.5° (JCPDS, No. 41-1487)<sup>22</sup> together with obvious signals belonging to the Fe (JCPDS, No. 87-0722) and Fe<sub>3</sub>C (JCPDS, No. 89-2867) could be clearly detected,<sup>23</sup> indicating the formation of bi-nanocrystals structure. Furthermore, complex the phthalocyanine-based polymer coated samples also displayed an excellent thermal stability. Figure S3 presents the TGA results of SiO<sub>2</sub>, Phth-Fe and Phth-Fe@SiO<sub>2</sub> complex simultaneously, from which, almost no weight loss could be detected for the Phth-Fe until 350°C. Raman spectra of HS-Phth-Fe-900 and Phth-Fe-900 are shown in Figure 3b. Two obvious peaks at around 1575 and 1335 cm<sup>-1</sup> assignable to the G-band of graphitized carbon and the D-band of disordered carbon, respectively, could be clearly detected.<sup>24</sup> The integrated intensity ratio of ID/IG is approximately 1.13 and 1.22 for HS-Phth-Fe-900 and Phth-Fe-900, respectively, indicating a high graphitic degree of prepared samples which is benefit for electrochemical applications.

The porous structure of prepared samples was revealed by low temperature nitrogen adsorption and desorption experiments at 77 K. As given in Figure 3c,  $N_2$  uptake isotherms shows a low BET surface area of 30.36 and 5.77  $m^2$   $g^{-1}$  for the Phth-Fe based polymer and Phth-Fe polymer coated samples (Phth-CMP-Fe@SiO<sub>2</sub>), respectively. And the pore width are mainly distributed at the macropore range for both polymers (Figure 3d). While, after carbonization and acid etching, the specific surface area of HS-Phth-Fe-900 and Phth-Fe-900 increased to 382 and 277  $m^2$   $g^{-1}$ , respectively. Otherwise, hierarchical pore structure ranged from micropore to macropore could be observed from the pore width distribution curve (Figure 3d). And the detail about the pore features of prepared samples was given in the electronic supporting information in Table S1 (ESI).

Figure 4a exhibits the XPS survey spectrum of as-prepared catalyst, from which obvious peaks belonging to the C (91.38 at%), N (1.43 at%), O (5.92 at%) and Fe (1.27 at%) could be observed. The N 1 s spectrum (Figure 4b) could be divided into four peaks distributed at 398.30 eV (pyridinic nitrogen, 16.80% in total N), 399.30 eV (iron-coordinated nitrogen, 20.48% in total N), 401.12 eV (pyrrolic nitrogen, 0.05% in total N), 401.12 eV (graphitic nitrogen, 48.24% in total N), and 402.79 eV (oxidized nitrogen, 14.43% in total N), respectively. The graphitic-N and pyridinic-N which has been proved favorable for the ORR through both the experiments and theory results are dominated among the deconvoluted N species.25 Furthermore, the Fe species could form the chelate structure (FeNx) with pyridinic and pyrrolic-N which are benefit for the ORR. And that could be evidenced by the high-resolution XPS of Fe 2p. As shown in Figure 4c, apart from the peak of N-coordinated iron species (Fe-Nx) at 711.03 eV, the high resolution Fe 2p spectra of HS-Phth-Fe-900 could also be divided into six peaks located at 709.77 eV (Fe<sup>2+</sup> 2p 3/2), 712.53 (Fe<sup>3+</sup> 2p3/2), 717.62 (satellite peak), 723.24 (Fe<sup>2+</sup> 2p 1/2), 726.16 (Fe<sup>3+</sup> 2p1/2) and 728.48 eV (satellite peak), respectively.26 The high-resolution XPS spectrum of C 1s are presented in Figure 4d. And the detail was listed in the Table S2 given in the supporting information.

Then we examine the electrochemical performance of asprepared catalysts in  $O_2$ -saturated electrolyte (0.1 M KOH) using

the typical rotating disk electrode (RDE) and rotating disk ring electrode (RRDE). K-L plots are calculated according to the Equation S1 and S2 given in the supporting information.

Figure 5a presents the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves of as-synthesized samples (Phth-Fe-900 and HS-Phth-Fe-900) together with the bench mark of commercial Pt/C (20%). One could observe clearly that HS-Phth-Fe-900 exhibits an excellent activity toward the ORR with a high onset potential (Eonset) and half-wave potential (E $_{1/2}$ ) of 0.964 and 0.823 V, respectively, surpassing the catalyst prepared free of template (Phth-Fe-900, Eonset=0.870 V, E $_{1/2}$ =0.740 V) and comparable to

that of commercial Pt/C (Eonset=0.992 V,  $E_{1/2}$ =0.833 V), suggesting the hollow structure is favorable for the ORR. <sup>27</sup> Furthermore, compared with the bulk catalyst prepared free of templates, the hollow catalysts (HS-Phth-Fe-900) presents an enhanced limited current. Also shown in Figure 5a, HS-Phth-Fe-900 shows a current of 4.887 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> (vs. 5.621 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> of commercial Pt/C) higher than that of Phth-Fe-900 (4.123 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>). The detail was listed in Table S3 in ESI.

The reaction mechanism of HS-Phth-Fe-900 was initially studied by the RDE measurements (Figure 5b). As shown in Figure 5c, K-L plots of HS-Phth-Fe-900, at various potentials ranged from 0.2 to 0.7 V, exhibit a good parallel linearity, implying a first-order reaction kinetics towards the concentration of  $O_2$ . And the calculated transfer electron number for HS-Phth-Fe-900 from the K-L plots is 3.86 (at 0.5 V vs. RHE), indicative a four electron pathway for the reduction of oxygen.

To investigate the reaction mechanism more detailedly, rotating ring-disk electrode measurement was carefully performed. As exhibited in Figure 5d, a negligible hydrogen peroxide yield (less than 16.7%) could be detected at the entire potential ranged from 0.15 to 0.90 V. And as same as the results obtained from K-L plots, the number of transferred electron (3.64-3.99 at the entire potential) calculated according to the Equation S3 and S4 is 3.88 for HS-Phth-Fe-900 (at 0.5 V vs. RHE), further indicating a four electron pathway toward ORR for prepared hollow catalyst. <sup>28</sup> And the enhanced performance of HS-Phth-Fe-900 toward ORR is attributed to formation of hollow nanoshell with hierarchical structure which is benefit for the accommodation and exposure of activate sites.

For the practical applications of electrocatalysts, a long-time stability is very crucial in energy storage and conversion systems.<sup>29</sup> The stability of HS-Phth-Fe-900 was evaluated by the chronoamperometry test. As shown in Figure 5e, HS-Phth-Fe-900 shows a stability exceeding that of the commercial Pt/C. A slight attenuation of 1.87% was observed for HS-Phth-Fe-900 after a long cycle time of 10000 s. By contrast, the current value of commercial Pt/C decreased to 60.9% of the initial value. And that could also be validated by the polarization curves measured before and after the i-t test (Figure 5g). As shown in Figure 5g, almost overlapping LSV curves was observed for HS-Phth-Fe-900 measured at a rotation speed of 1600 rpm with a scan rate of 5 mV s<sup>-1</sup>, while, dramatic shift was observed from the LSV curve of Pt-C after the i-t test. Moreover, HS-Phth-Fe-900 also exhibits an prominent methanol immunity validated by the i-t test. As is exhibited in Figure 5f, after the addition of methanol, the current of Pt/C decreased intensively, demonstrating a poor resistance to methanol. However, unlike the commercial Pt/C, the HS-Phth-Fe-900 is almost free from the methanol crossover effect with only small changes in current. Otherwise, the current could recover to the initial value with the increase of the cycle time, validating a much better fuel selectivity (Figure 5f).30 As shown in Figure 5h, dramatic shift was observed from the LSV curve of Pt-C after the addition of methanol. However, a tiny shift of (E<sub>1/2</sub>) only 5 mV was observed for HS-Phth-Fe-900 after the injection of 3 M methanol. All these further confirms that HS-Phth-Fe-900 is a highly stable and efficient catalyst for alkaline ORR. The Other information about the contrast sample was given in ESI (Figure S6 and S7).

#### **Conclusions**

Herein, a facile, green and controllable, but, rational and effective template-assisted in situ solid-phase synthesis method was developed for the massive synthesis of nanocatalysts with accurate structure, replacing the conventional synthesis method which the organic solvents are widely used. Different with previous reports, the nanoshell was prepared from the phthalocyanine-based conjugated porous polymer (Phth-Fe, with inherent micropore and mesopore) coated silica (macropore) which offers an more efficient means for the preparation of catalysts with hierarchical structure. Via this method, a highefficient and durable Fe-based electrocatalyst (HS-Phth-Fe-900) with hollow hemispheric structure was prepared. Comparing with the catalysts (Phth-Fe-900) prepared free of template, this innovative approach simultaneously provides a means to control the surface features, thereby tuning the catalytic property of obtained materials. That may open up new possibilities for the rational design and preparation of materials for electrochemical applications.

Facile and controllable, but, rational and effective in situ solid-phase synthesis method was developed to prepare a silica-templated Fephthalocyanine-based POP, which can be further converted into an iron and nitrogen codoped porous carbon (HS-Phth-Fe-900) upon carbonization and template removal. This innovative approach simultaneously provides a means to control the surface features, thereby tuning the catalytic property of obtained materials.

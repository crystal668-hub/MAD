# **Introduction**

Developing efficient non-precious metal (NPM) electrocatalysts as alternatives to the conventional noble-metal catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) has been a hot topic in the past decades around the world.[1] Among several types of non-noble ORR catalysts been reported, the graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) based catalysts have shown unique advantages over common porous carbon-based catalysts due to their high distribution of active centres and high electron conductivity.[2] The quantum interference effect combined with the high aspect ratio for GNRs render it with exotic electrochemical properties, making it an attractive electrocatalyst in electrochemical applications.[2a] Furthermore, it has been found that heteroatoms (such as N, B, et al.) and transition metals (such as Fe, Co, et al.) or their derivatives can be decorated on graphene-based catalysts to boost their actives. In particular, the Fe N C catalysts hold the greatest promise over their counterparts due to their high activity, great tunability, and abundant reserve on earth.[3] Both theoretical and experimental studies have demonstrated that FeNx species are the most active catalytic sites for ORR in Fe N C catalysts,[4] and immobilizing FeNx active sites into graphene matrix can render the resulting catalysts with multiple advantages, such as high electrocatalytic activity, high dispersity, and good electro-conductivity, etc.[5]

In preparing efficient Fe N C catalysts, MOFs have shown their unique advantages over other precursors in terms of easy tunability and controllability.[6] The uniform distribution of organic and inorganic components in MOF's framework and great designability render MOFs a versatile platform for designing and synthesizing advanced carbon-based electrocatalysts based on a bottom-up strategy.[6–7] Furthermore, the highly porous and crystalline nature of MOFs can also act as an ideal host material which facilitates us to immobilize active sites in resulting carbonized materials, providing an oriented synthetic strategy for constructing special catalysts toward ORR.[8] Since the first case of utilizing MOF as a precursor of ORR catalyst, several synthetic strategies for constructing Fe N C catalysts have been developed by employing various MOFs as precursors or by optimizing preparation procedures.[9] Although significant advances have been achieved in this area in the past decade, the controllable synthesis of Fe N C catalysts with optimized interface structures and a high density of FeNx active sites remains a great challenge. Utilizing the Fe N-containing MOFs as precursors is a direct way to fabricating Fe N C catalysts. However, the Fe species in MOF precursors tend to form FexC components which are less active than FeNx during the carbonization process.[10] Furthermore, arising from high surface energy, these highly dispersing Fe-containing species opt to aggregate with each other to give large agglomerates under

the defective protecting effect, thus failing to provide large numbers of active sites.[11] The tendency of packing for graphene sheets of carbon under the  $\pi$ - $\pi$  stacking force also hinders those active sites from being exposed to pore channels of catalysts. Eventually, the activity of Fe-N-C catalysts could be largely decreased owing to the uncontrolled evolution of Fespecies and easy agglomerate of active sites.

To ensure the uniform distribution of incorporated FeN, active sites in resulting carbonized materials, there is a need to prevent the migration of Fe during the pyrolysis. In this regard, chemical fixation rather than physical adsorption of Fe-containing species in MOF precursors are preferred. Herein, we report a controllable strategy for the synthesis of Fe<sub>2</sub>N-embedded Ndoped graphene nanoribbons (term Fe<sub>2</sub>N/NGNRs) which can be used as the efficient NPM catalyst for ORR in PEMFC. The chemical fixation of Fe<sup>2+</sup> ions in MOF precursors ensures the atomic Fe<sup>2+</sup> ions are immobilized on the ligand of a porous Al-MOF, inhibiting the migration of Fe atoms during subsequent thermal pyrolysis. After one-step carbonization, a type of Ndoped GNRs (NGNRs) with highly dispersing Fe<sub>2</sub>N nanoparticles embedded in a carbon matrix is achieved. The optimized structure combined with dispersing Fe<sub>2</sub>N sites in Fe<sub>2</sub>N/NGNRs endows this catalyst with excellent ORR activity in both alkaline and acidic conditions. The half-wave potential of 0.89 V vs. RHE outperforms the commercial Pt/C catalyst in an alkaline medium. Furthermore, it exhibits remarkable ORR activity in an acid medium. Its prominent ORR activity of Fe<sub>2</sub>N/NGNRs is validated in an H<sub>2</sub>-O<sub>2</sub> fuel cell which gives a peak power density of 307.7 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>. The prominent ORR performance demonstrates the effectiveness of this strategy in preparing efficient ORR catalysts.

#### **Results and Discussion**

The synthetic procedure for Fe<sub>2</sub>N/NGNRs is illustrated in Figure 1. Based on MOF-253, [12] an Al-MOF which comprises coordinated-free 2, 2'-bipyridine (BIPY) groups on the ligand in pore channels, the immobilization of Fe<sup>2+</sup> in MOF precursor through a post-synthetic modification (PSM) can afford a Feloaded Al-MOF. The PSM process was performed using a modified procedure in the literature.[12] Before PSM, the assynthesized MOF-253 is activated to remove the guest molecules in pore channels. Then, the activated MOF-253 is mixed with FeCl<sub>2</sub> and stirred in methanol to provide a FeCl<sub>2</sub>-modified MOF-253 (termed as FeCl<sub>2</sub>@MOF-253) (see experimental details in the Experimental section).

After modification by Fe<sup>2+</sup> ions, the color of the sample changed from white to brown which does not fade upon repeated washing and extracting process using solvents, indicating that the Fe2+ ions are incorporated into MOF via chemical bonds rather than physical absorption after modification. The chemical bond between Fe<sup>2+</sup> and the parent MOF can be validated by the Infrared (IR) spectrum in which the characteristic peaks of BIPY groups in MOF-253 exhibited a blue shift after PSM of Fe<sup>2+</sup> ions (as shown in Figure S1 in supporting information). PXRD patterns suggest that the FeCl<sub>2</sub>@MOF-253 remains a crystalline phase and possesses similar peaks with the as-synthesized MOF-253, suggesting that FeCl<sub>2</sub>@MOF-253 is isomorphous with the parent MOF (see PXRD patterns in Figure S2 in supporting information). Scanning Electronic Microscopy (SEM) images reveal that the FeCl<sub>2</sub>@MOF-253 exhibits similar rod-like morphologies as parent MOF-253 (as shown in Figure S3 in supporting information). N<sub>2</sub> adsorption measurements at 77 K showed a reduced surface area and a largely

decreased pore volume for FeCl2@MOF-253 compared to the parent MOF-253, indicating that some of the pore space in MOF-253 are occupied by coordinated Fe $^{2+}$  ions after PSM (see  $N_2$  isotherms in Figure S4 in supporting information). These combined results illustrate that the Fe $^{2+}$  ions are chemically bonded with the bi-pyridine groups on ligands of MOF-253. Such a chemical fixation not only ensures each Fe $^{2+}$  ion is anchored on the ligand in an isolated state but also gives rise to a large amount of Fe $_2N$  groups which are ideal precursors to imprint FeN $_x$  active sites in the resulting catalyst.

The direct carbonization of FeCl<sub>2</sub>@MOF-253 at 1000 °C under an Ar atmosphere followed by acid leaching provides this series of Fe-N-C catalysts (see experimental details in ESI). By loading different amounts of Fe<sup>2+</sup> ions in MOF-253 during PSM, five Fe<sub>2</sub>N/NGNRs catalysts with different Fe contents were obtained (termed Fe<sub>2</sub>N/NGNRs-x, in which x represents the ratio of Fe<sup>2+</sup>/ BIPY (%) in MOF precursors). For comparison, an N-doped porous carbon without Fe-containing dopants (termed NPC) was also prepared by direct carbonization of the parent MOF. And a N-doped porous carbon with Fe<sub>3</sub>C dopants (termed Fe<sub>3</sub>C/ NPC) was prepared by carbonizing Fe-doped ZIFs (see experimental details in ESI). PXRD pattern reveals intense peaks at 25 and 44.5° which can be corresponded to (002) and (100) lattice planes of graphene layers in NGNRs, respectively (as shown in Figure 2a). These two intense peaks suggest that the NGNRs in this catalyst possess a considerably high degree of graphitization. Such a situation is in clear contrast with common porous carbons which always exhibit weak and broad peaks in the PXRD pattern. The peaks at 37.7, 43.7, 57.5, and 68.5° in the PXRD pattern can be indexed as the phase of hexagonal Fe<sub>2</sub>N which crystallizes in a space group of P-31 m (JCPDS No. 72-2126, as shown in Figure 2a). Therefore, the Fe<sub>2</sub>N/NGNRs catalyst can be regarded as a composite material composed of Fe<sub>2</sub>N and graphene sheets. SEM images show that the obtained catalyst exhibits a morphology of nanoribbons (see SEM images in Figure 2b and 2c). Magnified SEM images show that these nanoribbons are composed of ultrathin graphene sheets with curved surfaces and a large aspect ratio (~10), agreeable with the characteristics of graphene nanoribbons (GNR) (see SEM image in Figure 2c). The GNR is in clear contrast with other MOF-derived catalysts, and it is rarely reported previously. Furthermore, elemental analysis suggests that the GNRs prepared in this work are actually N-doped GNRs owing to the N-heteroatoms in MOF precursors. Such a configuration not only facilitates the mass transfer process of electrolytes or gases but also provides as large amounts of exposing Fe<sub>2</sub>N active sites on catalysts as much as possible.

To investigate the fine structure of these core-shell structures, high resolution TEM (HRTEM) image was collected for these samples. A pure phase of Fe<sub>2</sub>N with the lattice spacing of 0.21 nm can be indexed, corresponding to the (2, -1, -1) crystal plane of Fe<sub>2</sub>N  $(43.5^{\circ}$  in the PXRD pattern). TEM images reveal that these nanoribbons are composed of ultrathin graphene sheets which are inter-crossed with each other (see TEM images in Figure 2h). Curves and wrinkles, the signatures of graphene sheets, are observed on these samples. Abundant curved strips caused by the bending or staggering of graphene

sheets can be seen at the joints of these graphene sheets. Besides, uniform nanoparticles with high contrast in the TEM image were homogeneously distributed in these inter-crossed nanoribbons. The mean diameters of these particles are about 35 nm (see TEM images in Figure 2g). Therefore, this catalyst can be regarded as a composite material composed of GNRs and Fe<sub>2</sub>N. Elemental mapping demonstrates that C, N, and O elements are uniformly distributed in the NGNRs. These results suggest that the introduced Fe-BIPY groups in MOF precursor evolve into Fe<sub>2</sub>N which has been identified as a new type of active catalytic site toward the ORR.<sup>[13]</sup> By incorporating these nano-scale Fe<sub>2</sub>N particles into the NGNRs, the Fe<sub>2</sub>N and NGNRs could function synergistically to enhance electrocatalytic ORR performance.

N<sub>2</sub> adsorption-desorption isotherm at 77 K shows a typical type-IV isotherm, suggesting that both micro- and meso-pores are involved in Fe<sub>2</sub>N/NGNR (see N<sub>2</sub> isotherms in Figure 3a). Different Fe<sub>2</sub>N/GNR samples display similar pore structures (see additional N<sub>2</sub> isotherms and pore structural parameter in Figure S5 and Table S1 in supporting information). The BET surface area is in the range of 926-1093 m<sup>2</sup>/g, and the pore volume is in the range of 1.30–1.72 cm<sup>3</sup>/g. Pore size distribution reveals both micro-pores centered at 0.8 nm and meso-pores centered at 5.1 nm in Fe<sub>2</sub>N/NGNRs (as shown in Figure 3a). Meso- and macro-pores account for 80% of its total pore volume (see pore structural parameters in Table S1 in ESI). Such a hierarchical pore structure can facilitate mass transportation which is a critical process in ORR. [4,14] Compared to Fe<sub>2</sub>N/NGNRs, NPC displays a similar N<sub>2</sub> isotherm and slightly larger surface area, indicating that the introduction of Fe-species does not significantly impact the evolution process of pores during thermal pyrolysis. To accurately determine Fe-contents in Fe<sub>2</sub>N/ NGNRs, the inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometer (ICP) measurements were performed. As shown in Figure 3b, the increase of Fe contents in Fe<sub>2</sub>N/NGNRs gradually flattens with increasing loading of Fe<sup>2+</sup> in FeCl<sub>2</sub>@MOF-53, suggesting that this is a limitation of Fe-contents in Fe-N-C catalysts by increasing Fe-loading in precursors. For Fe<sub>2</sub>N/NGNRs, the Fecontent reaches 4.3% when increasing the Fe<sup>2+</sup>/BIPY to 1 in FeCl<sub>2</sub>@MOF-53. In view of ORR activity for Fe-N-C catalysts, it is well known that there is an optimal Fe content which can render resulting Fe-N-C catalysts with the highest atom utilization efficiency. The excess Fe-loadings will lead to aggregation of Fe-N-C active sites, which could inversely decrease the density of exposing active sites for ORR.

Raman spectrum of  $Fe_2N/NGNRs$  exhibits the characteristic bands of disordered (D band,  $1385 \, \mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ ) and order carbon (G band,  $1586 \, \mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ ), respectively. Based on the Raman spectrum, the  $I_D/I_G$  value for  $Fe_2N/NGNRs$  and NPC can be determined as 0.89 and 1.20, suggesting that  $Fe_2N/NGNRs$  possess a higher degree of crystallinity than NPC. To investigate the local structures and the chemical states of each element, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was conducted on  $Fe_2N/NGNRs$ . As expected, C, N, O and Fe elements are involved in this series of  $Fe_2N/NGNRs$  (see XPS survey spectra in Figure S6 in supporting information). The deconvoluted XPS spectrum of C1s displays four types of carbon: C–C (284.6 eV), C–N

(285.8 eV), C–O (286.5 eV) and C=O (288.6 eV) in Fe $_2$ N/NGNRs. The C–O and C=O functional groups could be originated from the reduction of carboxylate groups of MOF precursors. It has been reported that these oxygen-containing groups can endow the carbon surface with enhanced wettability which can improve the interface properties of the electrode. The N $_{15}$  deconvoluted XPS spectrum exhibits four representative domains with binding energies centred at 398.5, 400.1, 401.1 eV,

and 403.2 eV, which can be ascribed to pyridinic-, pyrrolic-, graphitic- oxidic-N, respectively (Figure 3e). The intense peak at 401.1 eV shows that graphitic-N is dominant over other types of N-constituents. Based on the deconvoluted XPS scan for Fe<sub>2p</sub> displays, the existence of Fe<sup>3+</sup>:  $2p_{1/2}$  (726.2 eV),  $2p_{3/2}$  (713.3 eV), Fe<sup>2+</sup>:  $2p_{1/2}$  (723.2 eV),  $2p_{3/2}$  (710.8 eV) and FeN<sub>x</sub>: (712.4 eV) can be observed in Fe<sub>2</sub>N/NGNRs. Therefore, the oxidation state of

Fe-species in Fe<sub>2</sub>N/NGNRs can be determined as a mixture of +2 and +3, agreeable with the previous reports.<sup>[16]</sup>

The excellent external and local structure for  $Fe_2N/NGNRs$  encourages us to investigate their ORR activities. To conduct this, the ORR activities of  $Fe_2N/NGNRs$  in both alkaline (0.1 M KOH) and acid (0.1 M HClO<sub>4</sub>) solutions were evaluated by cyclic

voltammetry (CV) and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) using a rotating disk electrode (RDE). The intense reduction peak at 0.82 V vs. RHE on CV curve in the presence of  $O_2$  suggests their considerable ORR activity (as shown in CV curves in Figure S7 in supporting information). The LSV plots for  $Fe_2N/NGNRs$  with the different content of  $Fe_2N-dopants$  are shown in Figure 4b.

Compared to the carbon derived with no FeN<sub>x</sub> dopants (NPC), the Fe<sub>2</sub>N/NGNRs exhibited more positive on-set potential (E<sub>on-set</sub>) and half-wave potential ( $E_{1/2}$ ). As shown, the  $E_{on-set}$  for  $Fe_2N/$ NGNRs varies in the range of 0.965-0.985 V vs RHE, and the halfwave potentials are in the range of 0.80 - 0.89 V vs. RHE. These values are clearly much superior to the carbon with no Fe<sub>2</sub>N dopants (NPC), suggesting the key role of Fe<sub>2</sub>N dopants in promoting ORR activity. Other than excellent ORR activity, the Fe<sub>2</sub>N/NGNRs also displays a considerable ORR activity in acid medium. The  $E_{1/2}$  value of 0.79 V vs. RHE is only 0.02 V lower than that of Pt/C catalyst and is much positive than the Fe<sub>3</sub>C/ NPC catalyst (as shown in Figure S8 in supporting information). To further verify the exact active site for ORR, we added the masking agent NaSCN solution to the electrolyte. The half-wave potential and diffusion-limiting current density of Fe<sub>2</sub>N/NGNRsadd NaSCN have obvious decrease, and the reduced ORR activity was comparable to that of NPC (see comparison of LSV curves in Figure S9 in supporting information). The significant differences in ORR activity before and after adding the masking agent proved that the Fe<sub>2</sub>N is the active site of ORR. And this observation is agreeable with that disclosed in the previous report.[13]

However, this does not mean that the higher content of Fe dopants, the better the ORR activity. In fact, the E<sub>1/2</sub> exhibits a volcano-shaped trend with increasing Fe contents in catalysts. The best ORR catalytic performance is found on the catalyst with a Fe loading of 1.3%. This phenomenon suggests that a moderate content of Fe dopants can render the resulting catalysts with a higher density of exposed active sites. The excessive amount of Fe could lead to the aggregation of active sites, which could reversely decrease the ORR catalytic activity. The most active ORR catalytic activity is found on Fe<sub>2</sub>N/NGNRs-50, which gives an  $E_{on-set}$  of 0.985 V vs. RHE and an  $E_{1/2}$  value of 0.89 V vs. RHE. In contrast, the  $E_{1/2}$  value of Pt/C catalyst is 0.85 V vs. RHE. Noteworthy, the  $E_{1/2}$  value is 40 mV more positive than the Pt/C catalyst, suggesting the prominent catalytic activity for Fe<sub>2</sub>N/NGNRs. This catalyst also provides a highdiffusion limited current density (5.9 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> at a rotating speed of 1600 rpm). This observation demonstrates that at this loading, the density of FeN<sub>x</sub> active sites on the catalysts reaches the maximum value, above which the active sites opt to agglomerate. Therefore, too low or too high loading of Fe heteroatoms on catalysts will be detrimental to ORR activity. This observation is agreeable with that observed in former literature.[17]

Based on LSV curves at different rotation speeds, the electron-transfer number(n) can be calculated using the Koutecky-Levich (K–L) equation. The derived n value of 3.90 suggests that the catalytic process on Fe<sub>2</sub>N/NGNRs is dominated by the four-electron transfer process. This process is confirmed by Rotation ring-disk electrode (RRDE) measurement which reveals an electron transfer number of 3.95 at 0.6 V vs. RHE on Fe<sub>2</sub>N/NGNRs. The H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production rate is determined as 3.5% based on RRDE measurements. The much lower H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production on Fe<sub>2</sub>N/NGNRs compared to NPC also demonstrates that the decoration of Fe<sub>2</sub>N dopants can facilitate the four-electron pathway during ORR. Tafel-plots suggest a Tafel slope of

76.7 mV/dec. The lower Tafel slope suggests that the ORR process undergoes a faster kinetic, validating the outstanding catalytic efficiency of Fe<sub>2</sub>N/NGNRs.

Apart from activity, durability and methanol tolerance are also crucial aspects of electrocatalysts. The durability of catalytic performance in both alkaline and acidic mediums was tested. As shown in Figure 4f, the Fe<sub>2</sub>N/NGNRs retained 96% of their current density after 36 hours of running in an alkaline medium. In contrast, the Pt/C catalyst only retains 68% of its original current density after 36 hours under the same conditions. For the Pt/C catalyst, the Pt nanoparticles could migrate and aggregate with each other to form large particles under the Ostwald ripening effect, thus decreasing the activity of the Pt/C catalyst. [18] However, the well-structured Fe<sub>2</sub>N/NGNRs could resist such effects and show good durability during ORR. Likewise, Fe<sub>2</sub>N/NGNRs exhibit excellent methanol tolerance, as suggested by its unchanged current density towards the addition of methanol in the electrolyte. In contrast, the current density drops significantly on the Pt/C catalyst after the addition of methanol. The excellent durability combined with good methanol tolerance demonstrates the superiority of Fe<sub>2</sub>N/ NGNRs over conventional Pt/C catalysts.

To evaluate the realistic performance of  $Fe_2N/NGNRs$  in PEMFC, the membrane electrode assembly (MEA) loaded with  $Fe_2N/NGNRs$  was fabricated for the cathode of an  $H_2$ - $O_2$  fuel cell (see experimental conditions in experimental section). Figure 5a

to 5b exhibit the plot of power densities and cell voltages versus current density at different catalyst loading and operating temperatures. The results demonstrate that the open circuit voltage (OCV) is about 0.8 V which varies slightly with the operating temperature. The higher operating temperature is beneficial for the cell voltage as well as power density. At an operating temperature of 80 °C, we investigated the impact of catalyst loading. It is apparent that a much higher power density can be achieved at a loading of 4 mg/cm<sup>2</sup> than that at 1 and 2 mg/cm<sup>2</sup>. At an optimized catalyst loading and operating temperature, the Fe<sub>2</sub>N/NGNRs give a peak power density of 320 mV/cm<sup>2</sup>, which is comparable with other well-behaved non-noble ORR catalysts.<sup>[19]</sup> Meanwhile, the single cell performance of Pt/C were tested and compared (see Figure S10 in supporting information). The fuel cell power density of Pt/C exhibits a peak of 1.137 W cm<sup>-2</sup>. Compared with the Pt/C, Fe<sub>2</sub>N/ NGNRs exhibits a comparable open circuit voltage and a lower peak power density, suggesting that there is still a gap of the fuel cell performance between the commercial Pt/C catalyst and the Fe2 N/NGNRs catalyst. The gap in single cell PEMFC performance could be attributed to the relative low density of active sites. In all, the prominent performance of the H<sub>2</sub>-O<sub>2</sub> single-cell test validates the excellent catalytic activity of this type of electro-catalysts.

#### Conclusion

In summary, a type of non-noble catalyst with controlled doping of FeN<sub>x</sub> active sites in carbon matrix is synthesized through a post-synthetic coordination of Fe<sup>2+</sup> in MOF precursor and the following pyrolysis. The coordination of Fe<sup>2+</sup> ions in MOFs which contains BIPY groups on linkers not only ensures the uniform dispersing of Fe-dopants but also enables the Fe-N moieties (Fe-BIPY) to be incorporated in the precursor. After carbonization, the immobilized Fe-N groups transfer into FeN<sub>x</sub> which lies in a nano-sized Fe-N/C core-shell particle. These core-shell particles were embedded in the nano-ribbons that were formed by the carbonization of MOFs. Electrochemical measurements reveal outstanding catalytic activities towards ORR in both alkaline and acidic mediums. The  $E_{1/2}$  values of 0.89 V vs. RHE are among the high ranks of nonnoble catalyst for ORR and are comparable with that of Pt/C catalysts. The single-cell test validates the excellent catalytic activity in PEMFC applications. Furthermore, the FeN, Cs catalyst exhibits excellent durability and good tolerance to methanol. The above results demonstrate the effectiveness of this catalyst and may open up an avenue for developing a highly efficient catalyst for energy storage and conversion applications.

## **Experimental Section**

#### Materials synthesis

#### Synthesis of MOF-253:

The MOF-253 was prepared through a modified procedure of literature. The AlCl $_3\cdot 6H_2O$  (0.302 g, 1.25 mmol), BPYDC (0.306 g, 1.25 mmol), DMF (30 ml), HAc (2.0 ml) were mixed and placed into a Telfon-lined stainless container (50 ml). After stirring for 30 minutes, the container was sealed and placed into a programmed oven. The container was heated for 72 hours at 120 °C. After cooling to room temperatures, the obtained white powder was filtrated and was washed with fresh solvents. The white powder was dried at 60 °C to produce a pure phase of MOF-253.

#### Synthesis of FeCl<sub>2</sub>@MOF-253

In a typical procedure, MOF-253 (0.5 g, 1.0 mol), anhydrous  $\text{FeCl}_2$  (0.0665 g, 0.52 mmol), and DMF were added into a round bottom bottle. After stirring at room temperature for 30 minutes, the bottle was heated to 60 °C for 12 hours. After cooling down to room temperature, the product was filtrated and washed with fresh DMF several times. The obtained powder was dried at 80 °C under vacuum for 12 hours.

#### Synthesis of Fe<sub>2</sub>N/NGNRs

The powder of FeCl<sub>2</sub>@MOF-253 was placed in a quartz boat which was located in the center of a tube furnace. The tube was evacuated and re-filled with Ar to exclude air. Afterward, the furnace was heated up to  $1000\,^{\circ}\text{C}$  at a heating rate of  $5\,^{\circ}\text{C/min}$  under an Ar atmosphere. After 1 hour of duration time of heating, the furnace was cooled down naturally. The obtained black powder was then subjected to acid leaching using HF aqueous solution (20%) at  $60\,^{\circ}\text{C}$  for 12 hours to remove  $\text{Al}_2\text{O}_3$ . After washing and drying at  $80\,^{\circ}\text{C}$  for 12 hours, the catalyst was obtained.

#### Synthesis of NPC

The NPC was prepared by the same procedure as Fe<sub>2</sub>N/NGNRs except that the parent MOF-253 was directly used as the precursor.

#### Synthesis of Fe<sub>3</sub>C/NPC

The  $Fe_3C/NPC$  was prepared by carbonizing the Fe-doped ZIFs which was prepared using the reported procedure.

**Natural chloroplasts containing big amounts of chlorophylls (magnesium porphyrin, Mg-Chl) are employed both as template and porphyrin source to synthesize biomorphic CoNC/CoO***x* **composite as electrocatalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Cobalt-substituted chlorophyll derivative (Co-Chl) in chloroplasts is first obtained by successively rinsing in hydrochloric acid and cobalt acetate solutions. After calcining in nitrogen to 800 °C, Co-Chl is transferred to CoNC; while other parts of chloroplasts adsorbed with Co ions are transferred to CoO***x* **retaining the microarchitecture of chloroplasts. The abundant active CoNC sites are protected by circumjacent biocarbon and CoO***x* **to avoid leakage and agglomeration, and at the same time can overcome the poor conductivity weakness of CoO***x* **by directly transporting electrons to the carbonaceous skeleton. This unique synergistic effect, together with efficient bioarchitecture, leads to good electrocatalytical performance for the ORR. The onset and half-wave potentials are 0.89 and 0.82 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, respectively, with better durability and methanol tolerance than that of commercial Pt/C. Different from the traditional concept of biomorphic materials which simply utilize bioarchitectures, this work provides a new example of coupling bioderivative components with bioarchitectures into one integrated system to achieve good comprehensive performance for electrocatalysts.**

efficiency of fuel cells. The complicated reaction path and relatively slow reaction velocity for ORR make it highly demanding to search for efficient electrocatalysts.[1] Although platinum-based materials show high catalytic activity, the scarcity, high price, and easy poisoning features make them unsuitable for widespread use in industry. Hence, developing low-cost and efficient electrocatalyts for ORR has been a hot topic in the past decades.[2]

Transition metal based materials are consistently attracting intense attention because the empty d orbits and alterable valences of transition metals usually lead to high catalytic activity.[3] For example, various transition metal oxides, such as CoO*x*, FeO*x*, NiO*x*, and MnO*x*, have been studied and developed to be electrocatalysts for ORR.[4] These oxides exhibit the advantages of low cost and good stability; while at the same time share a common weakness of low conductivity. So transition metal oxides are usually combined with other conducting substances, such as carbon and metals, when applying as electrocatalysts.[2b]

Unlike metal oxides, the widespread attention for metal porphyrins and phthalocyanines as promising electrocatalysts is drawn only in the recent 10 years.[5] Aside from central transition metals with alterable valence states to give and accept electrons, the macrocyclic conjugated ligand provide a "high speed way" to deliver electrons.[6] In most cases, pyrolysis is conducted before actually applying the metallomacrocyclics as electrocatalyst. The catalytic activity and stability can be further promoted after calcining in inert atmosphere to 700–900 °C. In the calcining process, the organic macrocyclic ligands are partially decomposed to carbon; while the central metals coordinated by nitrogen atoms are preserved. Hence, the ultimate composition of electrocatalyst derived from metal porphyrins or phthalocyanines is MNC (M = transition metals including Fe, Co, Ni, Mn, Cu, etc.), comprising catalytic active MN center with carbonized ligand debris surrounding them.[7] In other words, the heating treatment relocates the MN sites from a π-electron-rich macrocyclic ligand environment to a

**www.small-journal.com**

relatively π-electron-deficient carbon debris environment.[8] Despite the changed electronic density, this arrangement maintains the efficient electron giving, accepting, and delivering behavior.[9] What is more, the defective debris and moieties provides more chemical adsorptive sites for reactive species, leading to higher catalytic activity.[10] Various MNC based materials with different core metals have been investigated and verify the aforementioned properties as ORR catalysts.[11]

Aside from the above concerns on chemical composition, it is also necessary to construct catalysts into micro/nanoarchitectures with high accessible surface area to ensure sufficient available active sites and fast mass/charge transport behavior.[12] For MNC, the mostly applied method is combining with nanostructured carbon, such as carbon nanotubes, carbon black, and graphene.[13] These works share a common process of modifying precursor metallomacrocyclics on carbon surface followed by pyrolysis. Although the architecture of carbon substrates can be utilized, only limited amounts of MNC can be introduced to carbon surface; and what is more, the active moieties may also secede or agglomerate during the reaction process leading to unsatisfying stability.[14] Hence, after comprehensive analysis, we believe that designing a micro/nanoarchitectured composite with sufficient MNC surrounded by stable oxides would be a worth trying way for achieving highperformance ORR catalyst. In the designed system, oxides are assumed to protect MNC from leakage and agglomeration; while MNC would provide efficient electronic conducting routes for oxides.

To attain the above mentioned goal, we turned to Mother Nature for inspiration. In fact, two new concepts, namely biomorphic material and biomimetic device, have been put forward in the last decade. The former refers to using natural organisms as templates to endow artificial materials with elaborate bioarchitectures for different purposes.[15] The latter means learning from the design wisdom or function mechanism of nature to obtain high-performance artificial devices.[16] Here, chloroplasts grabbed our attention due to their rich chlorophyll content and efficient mass/charge transport architecture. To be more specific, chloroplasts, as the main site for photosynthesis, contain abundant chlorophylls (magnesium porphyrin, Mg-Chl) whose central magnesium can be substituted by other metals to obtain different metal porphyrins (M-Chl) for fabricating electrocatalytical MNC.[17] What is more, the morphology of chloroplast is microellipsoid with numerous grana dispersing inside. The grana are composed of nanolamellar thylakoids stacking and interconnecting with each other to ensure efficient charge transfer.[18] More importantly, chlorophylls as the active sites for photochemical reaction disperse evenly on the membrane of thylakoids, realizing effective coupling of composition and architecture. These features exactly coincide with the requirements of ORR electrocatalyst: high specific surface area carrying abundant active composition and hierarchical arrangement allowing fast mass/charge transport.

Therefore, employing natural chloroplasts as template and porphyrin source to synthesize biomorphic MNC/MO*x* is a good idea to realize the predesigned system. Here, we extracted chloroplasts from spinach and chose metal Co as an exemplary attempt to synthesize biomorphic CoNC/CoO*x* composite (**Scheme 1**). First, the chlorophyll (Mg-Chl) in chloroplasts was transferred to pheophytin (H2-Chl) by rinsing in hydrochloric acid. After that, the central H ions in H2-Chl were further replaced by Co ions to form Co-Chl by rinsing the samples in

Co(CH3COO)2 solution. After that, the Co-Chl rich chloroplasts were freeze dried before being calcined in nitrogen atmosphere. By heating to 800 °C, Co-Chl was transferred to CoNC; while other parts of chloroplasts with chemically adsorbed Co precursors were transferred to biocarbon and CoO*x* with chloroplast microarchitecture. The as-obtained biomorphic composite exhibited outstanding electrocatalytic performance for ORR, with an onset and half-wave potential of 0.89 and 0.82 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), respectively. What is more, the composite shows better durability and methanol tolerance than that of commercial Pt/C. The good performance should be attributed to the synergistic effect of active CoNC and CoO*x* as well as the micro/nanoarchitecture derived from natural chloroplasts. This work provides a prototype for designing and fabricating efficient ORR catalysts and at the time provides an inspiration for the extending application of biomass resources and the derivative synthesis of biomorphic materials.

## **2. Results and Discussion**

The abundance of chloroplasts in spinach leaves can be demonstrated by Figure S1a in the Supporting Information, in which the cross-section slice of leaf was observed under laser scanning confocal microscope (LSCM). Under the irritation of excitation light (wavelength: 488 nm and 395 nm), red and blue fluorescence were emitted from chlorophyll and cell walls, respectively. Given that chlorophylls only exist in chloroplasts, the big red area indicates massive distribution of chloroplasts in mesophyll cells. As shown by the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image in Figure S1b in the Supporting Information, natural chloroplasts extracted from spinach leaves are ellipsoids with a diameter of 2–5 µm. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the ultrathin cross-section slice prove that the ellipsoidal chloroplasts display a hollow feature with nanolamellar grana dispersing inside (Figure S1c, Supporting Information). The depth of each lamella is about 20 nm according to Figure S1d in the Supporting Information.

Original chloroplasts with big amounts of chlorophylls were transferred to Co-Chl rich chloroplasts (Co-Chl/chloroplasts) by demagnesium and Co-substitution method. Figure S2 in the Supporting Information shows the photographs of the samples obtained on each step. It is obvious that the color of samples changed from green to brown after demagnesium; from brown to green after Co-substitution; and from green to black after calcination. **Figure 1**a shows the UV-visible (UV–vis) spectra of the diluted liquid extracted on each stage mainly containing Mg-Chl, H2-Chl, and Co-Chl, respectively. It is obvious that the intensity ratio of Q and Soret band is increased in the sequence of Co-Chl > Mg-Chl > H2-Chl. In addition, compared to the four absorption peaks of Q band for H2-Chl (QX(1,0), QX(0,0), QY(1,0), QY(0,0)), the QX(0,0) peak disappears for Mg-Chl; while both the QX(1,0) and QX(0,0) peaks disappear for Co-Chl. The reason is that, for the four N atoms on the porphyrin ring of H2-Chl, only two are connected to H atoms. This lowers the symmetry of H2-Chl molecules and leads to energy level splitting of the degenerate orbit producing four absorbance peaks for Q band. Whereas, all the four N atoms are coordinated with the central metal for M-Chl, which increases the symmetry of molecules leading to the fading or disappearance of QX(1,0) or QX(0,0) peak. At the same time, the QY peak shifts to short wavelength direction with the peak width becoming wider to different levels. What is more, the connection between ligands and Co atoms are covalent bond dominated, which is stronger than the ionic bond dominated connection between ligands and Mg atoms. This explains why the variation from the spectrum of H2-Chl is more obvious for Co-Chl than for Mg-Chl.[19] Also, the as-obtained Co-Chl is more stable than Mg-Chl and H2-Chl because of the stronger bonding between Co ion and porphyrin ring. Fluorescence spectra of Mg-Chl, H2-Chl, and Co-Chl were further recorded under an exciting wavelength of 406 nm (Figure 1b). It is obvious that H2-Chl shows a longest fluorescent wavelength of 677.2 nm because the absence of central metal atom in the porphyrin ring leads to better molecular planarity. Both the spectra of Mg-Chl and Co-Chl move to the short wavelength direction compared with that of H2-Chl. The much shorter wavelength of Co-Chl (664.8 nm) compared to Mg-Chl (673.1 nm) is due to the higher electronegativity of Co than Mg.[20] The UV–vis and fluorescence spectra together verify the completion of demagnesium and Co-substitution process.

The morphology of Co-Chl/chloroplasts is displayed in **Figure 2**a,b. The SEM and TEM images indicate that Co-substitution of chlorophylls did not break the microellipsoidal and nanolamellar architecture of chloroplasts. After calcined to 800 °C in nitrogen atmosphere, the diameter

of ellipsoids shrank to 300–500 nm (Figure 2c). Figure 2d shows the high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) images of the as-fabricated biomorphic material. The ultrathin membranes of thyladoids experienced great shrinkage and collapsion in the carbonization process, so that the original lamellar feature could not be easily found in the final product. The uniformly dispersed particles with an approximate size of 30–40 nm are CoO. The interplanar spacing of 0.246 nm shown in the lattice image matches well with the (111) plane of CoO in *Fm-3m* space group. Aside from crystallized CoO grains, the rest uncrystallized area is biocarbon with CoNC moieties dispersing inside. This can be demonstrated by elemental mapping images shown by Figure 2e, in which the crystallized particles are dominantly occupied by Co and O elements; while the uncrystallized area contains large amounts of C with traces of N, Co, and O elements. It is worth noting that, the quantity of N is obviously bigger than that of Co in the uncrystallized area. The reason is that, aside from chlorophyll derivative and carbohydrate, the component of chloroplast and grana also contains big amounts of lipid and protein with rich N element, leading to massive distribution of N in the biocarbon product. The corresponding energy dispersive X-ray spectrum and detailed elemental data are shown in Figure S3 in the Supporting Information. As the elemental mapping area was mainly concentrated on the CoO*x* particle, Co and O amounts in the data are relatively higher than the real contents in the bulk material.

**Figure 3** shows the nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherm of CoNC/CoO*x*, which exhibited type-II feature with a distinctive H3-type hysteresis loop at relative pressures (*P*/*P*0) from 0 to 1.0. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) specific surface area was estimated to be 408.7 m2 g<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> with a total pore volume of 0.61 cm3 g<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> . The porosity, with size distribution shown by inset (mainly below 20 nm), is believed to be from the space between CoO*x* particles and the pile gaps of the biomorphic material.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of biomorphic materials calcined to different temperatures are shown in **Figure 4**a. Aside from the assumed CoNC which cannot be tested by XRD,

the rest components are cobalt oxides (CoO*x*). The diffraction peaks at 36.5°, 42.4°, 61.5°, 73.7°, and 77.5° correspond well with (111), (200), (220), (311), and (222) planes of CoO; while other peaks match well with the planes of Co3O4. It is obvious that the oxides are mainly CoO with small amounts of Co3O4 for CoNC/CoO*x*-700 and CoNC/CoO*x*-900. For CoNC/CoO*x*-800, the trace signal of Co3O4 can be neglected compared to the high intensity of CoO signal. It is reasonable that Co precursors would be decomposed into CoO when heating under oxygen-free atmosphere. However, small amounts of Co3O4 can still be formed due to the oxidizing effect of agents from pyrolysis of organic chloroplasts. Conversely, as the temperature increases, Co3O4 can also be decomposed into CoO and O2 in inert atmosphere.[21] This explains why the slight amount of Co3O4 under 700 °C disappeared when calcined to 800 °C. In 900 °C, however, the generated O2 together with pyrolysis gases make some CoO be oxidized again to form Co3O4. Unless otherwise stated, the calcining temperature for materials in this paper all refers to 800 °C. Aside from CoNC/CoO*x*, H2-Chl/chloroplasts and Mg-Chl/ chloroplasts were also calcined in nitrogen atmosphere to obtain biomorphic NC and MgNC as control samples for comparison. What is more, biomorphic CoNC was obtained by removing CoO*x* from CoNC/CoO*x* through acid pickling; pure CoO*x* was synthesized by directly calcining Co(CH3COO)2 to 800 °C in nitrogen atmosphere. XRD patterns of NC and MgNC display two broad bumps at 24.0° and 44.0° demonstrating the amorphous and partial graphitization feature of biocarbon after pyrolysis (Figure S4, Supporting Information). XRD patterns of CoNC verifies that most CoO was removed from CoNC/CoO*x* via acid pickling, leaving only traces of Co3O4 existing in the interior part of material (Figure S5, Supporting Information). In order to investigate the effect of metal ions in the carbonization process, Raman spectroscopy was further conducted to assess the crystalline quality of different samples. As shown in Figure 4b, the intensity ratio of D and G bands (*I*D/*I*G) for MgNC (1.91) is lower than that of NC (2.95) indicating that the existence of Mg in chlorophyll is beneficial for forming ordered carbon in the calcining process. For CoNC/CoO*x*, Co elements not only existed in porphyrin rings but also be adsorbed to other part of chloroplasts. This explains why CoNC/CoO*x* shows the lowest *I*D/*I*G of 1.50 because more Co atoms are more favorable for graphitization.[22] The additional peak at 675 cm<sup>−</sup>1 was due to the exist-

ence of CoO.[21] To further determine the chemical composition of materials, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was conducted as well. The survey spectra verified the existence of Co, N, C, O elements for CoNC/CoO*x*; the presence of Mg, N, C, O elements for MgNC; and the mere existence of N, C, O elements for NC (Figure 4c). To study the bonding and electronic states of CoNC/CoO*x*, high-resolution spectra were further analyzed. As shown in Figure 4d, the Co 2p3/2 spectrum can be deconvoluted into sub-spectra centered at 780.2, 781.8, and 779.5 eV, which correspond to CoO (57.7%), CoN (39.4%), and Co0 (2.9%), respectively, together with a 785.8 eV satellite peak.[23] This indicates that, aside from dominant CoO*x*, Co element mainly existed in the form of CoN bonding with traces of metallic Co in the composite. To further demonstrate this consideration, Co 2p3/2 spectrum for CoNC was also analyzed as shown in Figure S6 in the Supporting Information with detailed deconvoluted data shown in Table S1 in the Supporting Information. Compared to CoNC/CoO*x*, the amount of CoN in CoNC increases due to the dissolution of surface CoO*x* after acid picking. The remaining CoO are believed to be from the remaining CoO*x* in the interior part of material as well as the oxidized species on the sample surface, which agrees well with the XRD result (Figure S5, Supporting Information). Table S2 in the Supporting Information shows the element compositions of MgNC and CoNC obtained from XPS survey, further proving the complete substitution of Mg with Co for chlorophyll derivatives. The more amount of Co in CoNC than the amount of Mg in MgNC is from the unremoved CoO*x*. In addition, the Co 2p3/2 spectrum in pure CoO*x* matches well with the CoO bonding at 780.2 eV (Figure S7, Supporting Information). Figure 4e shows the high-resolution N 1s spectrum which has been deconvoluted into four peaks. The peaks at 398.4, 399.2, 400.6, and 401.9 eV can be assigned to pyridinic-N (13.8%), CoN (18.7%), pyrrolic-N (35.9%), and graphitic-N (31.6%), respectively.[24] This indicates that, aside from chlorophyll derivatives which transferred into CoN, most distributed N in the biocarbon are from pyrolyzed lipid and protein in the chloroplasts. Those N rich sites are believed to be beneficial for increasing electrocatalytic activity.[25] Furthermore, N1s spectra for CoNC and NC were deconvoluted and compared as well (Figures S8 and S9, Supporting Information). The amount of CoN slightly decreased to 15.7% in CoNC; while no CoN bonding was detected in NC (Table S3, Supporting Information). The deconvolution result for C 1s is shown in Figure 4f, presenting four types of carbon functionalities which are CC (284.6 eV), CO (285.3 eV), CO (286.5 eV), and CN (288.2 eV). The O 1s spectrum is also deconvoluted into four peaks (Figure S10, Supporting Information). Peaks at 529.8, 531.4, and 532.7 eV correspond to the signal of cobalt oxides. The peak at 533.2 eV is ascribed to the carbon oxygen species in biocarbon.[26] The above results jointly demonstrate that CoNC, CoO*x*, traces of Co0 and partially graphitized

amorphous carbon from organic pyrolysis coexisted in the asfabricated biomorphic composite.

To investigate the ORR performance, samples were modified on glassy carbon rotating disk electrode (RDE, 5 mm diameter) for electochemical testing. The loading amount was 0.04 mg biomorphic composite on per electrode (0.2 mg cm−<sup>2</sup> ). All current densities were calculated based on the current signal per area of modified RDE. First, cyclic voltammetry (CV) was carried out in 0.1 mol L−<sup>1</sup> potassium hydroxide (KOH) with the RDE not rotating. As shown in **Figure 5**a, the CV curve for CoNC/ CoO*x*-800 in oxygen saturated solution exhibited a distinct ORR peak around 0.81 V which is similar to that of commercial Pt/C (20 wt%). However, the peak positions for CoNC and CoO*<sup>x</sup>* are much more negative with lower current densities compared to CoNC/CoO*x*-800. This indicates that significant synergistic effect occurs between CoNC and CoO*x* for CoNC/CoO*<sup>x</sup>* composite. For NC and MgNC, the reduction peaks are not obvious indicating poor ORR activity. Figure 5b shows the CV curves of CoNC/CoO*x* samples with different calcining temperatures. It is reasonable that the peak current densities of CoNC/CoO*x*-700 and CoNC/CoO*x*-900 were lower than that of CoNC/CoO*x*-800, because Co2<sup>+</sup> sites have been demonstrated to be more favorable for the adsorption of oxygen and for subsequent electron transfer of ORR than Co3<sup>+</sup> sites.[27] Aside from the relative contents of Co2+ sites (CoO), another important reason may be from the different pyrolysis degrees under different temperatures. Generally, higher calcining temperature means more complete pyrolysis of bio-organism and better conductivity of materials. However, the chemical bonds of CoNC would be damaged when temperature goes too

high. So there should be an optimum calcining temperature to achieve the best electrocatalytic performance, which is proved to be 800 °C by CV results for this work.

Further evaluation of ORR activity was conducted with the RDE rotating at different speeds. The liner sweep voltammetry (LSV) results in oxygen saturated 0.1 mol L<sup>-1</sup> KOH at rotation speed of 1600 rpm are displayed in Figure 5c with detailed data listed in Table 1. The onset and half-wave potentials of Co-N-C/CoO<sub>x</sub>-800 were 0.89 and 0.82 V versus RHE, respectively. Both values were more positive than those of Co-N-C/  $CoO_x$ -700 (0.86 and 0.80 V vs RHE) and  $Co-N-C/CoO_x$ -900 (0.76 and 0.61 V vs RHE). The limiting current density of Co-N-C/CoO<sub>x</sub>-800 was also the highest, which was 0.47 and 2.86 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> higher than that of Co-N-C/CoO<sub>x</sub>-700 and Co-N-C/CoO<sub>x</sub>-900, respectively. This agrees well with the above mentioned CV results and confirms that the optimum calcining temperature is 800 °C. After removing CoO<sub>x</sub> from the composite, the remaining Co-N-C performed an onset and half-wave potential of 0.84 and 0.78 V versus RHE, respectively, with a limiting current density of 3.57 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. The inferior performance of Co-N-C compared to Co-N-C/ CoO<sub>x</sub> demonstrates the importance of CoO<sub>x</sub> on enhancing electrocatalytic behavior. For pure CoO<sub>x</sub>, the onset and half-wave potentials (0.63 and 0.57 V vs RHE) are more negative than those of Co-N-C mostly because of its low electronic conductivity. The synergistic effect of Co-N-C and CoO<sub>x</sub> in the biomorphic composite can be speculated as follows: Co ions with alterable valence states in Co-N-C and CoO<sub>x</sub> act as dominant active sites for electrocatalysis; the  $\pi$ -electron-deficient ligand debris surrounding the Co-N center, together with the **www.advancedsciencenews.com www.small-journal.com**

a)Onset potential was acquired at an ORR current density of 0.1 mA cm−<sup>2</sup> ; b)Limiting current density was obtained at 0.3 V versus RHE.

N rich biocarbon substrate can efficiently transfer and deliver electrons during the reaction process. It is worth mentioning that the onset potential of CoNC/CoO*x*-800 was only 80 mV negative than that of Pt/C (0.97 V vs RHE); the half-wave potential and the limiting current density were equivalent to those of Pt/C (0.82 V vs RHE and 4.94 mA cm−<sup>2</sup> ). What is more, as an important factor for characterizing ORR kinetics, Tafel plots of all samples are drawn and compared in Figure 5d. Obviously, CoNC/CoO*x*-800 exhibits a Tafel slope of 38.6 mV dec−<sup>1</sup> which is smaller than that of Pt/C (65.5 mV dec−<sup>1</sup> ). This indicates more favorable ORR kinetics on the biomorphic catalyst.

The kinetics of CoNC/CoO*x*-800 was further studied by recording LSV curves at various rotation speeds (Figure 5e). Figure 5f shows the corresponding Koutecky–Levich (K–L) plots obtained from LSV curves. All plots are linear and parallel to each other indicating first-order reaction kinetics toward the dissolved oxygen concentration. The electron transfer number (*n*) is determined from the slope of K–L plot at different potentials.[28] The calculated value between 3.8 and 3.9 indicates an efficient four-electron transfer process on the catalyst. Summary and comparison of the properties of recent works on MNC based ORR catalysts is shown in Table S4 in the Supporting Information. It is obvious that the as-synthesized biomorphic CoNC/CoO*x* exhibits good electrocatalytic performance in term of onset and half-wave potential, Tafel slope, etc.

To thoroughly examine the prospects of applying biomorphic CoNC/CoO*x* to real fuel cells, long-term durability, and methanol tolerance were further evaluated by chronoamperometry. As shown in **Figure 6**a, the current of CoNC/CoO*x* retains 89.9% of the initial value after continuous operation under 0.6 V versus RHE for 20 000 s; while the current retention for CoNC after removing CoO*x* decreases to 83.5% (Figure S11, Supporting Information). This verifies that CoO*x* plays an important role on increasing the stability of CoNC/CoO*<sup>x</sup>* composite. In addition, the current retention after 20 000 s for Pt/C is only 66.2%. This demonstrates that the as-synthesized biomorphic material has higher stability than commercial Pt/C. What is more, when adding methanol to the solution, the current

of Pt/C decreases sharply with a current retention of 50.5% after 2000 s; while for CoNC/CoO*x*, the current retention is 92.1% showing excellent methanol tolerance (Figure 6b).

The excellent ORR performance on CoNC/CoO*x* should be attributed to its unique composition and architecture features. On one hand, CoNC and CoO*x* are composited on biocarbon in a way that enhances the strengths and avoids the weaknesses of each component. More specifically, active CoNC is protected by the circumjacent biocarbon and CoO*<sup>x</sup>* to avoid leakage and agglomeration; while active CoO*x* derived from chemically adsorbed precursor on bio-organism can overcome the weakness of poor conductivity and directly transport electrons to the carbonaceous skeleton. On the other hand, biomorphic CoNC/CoO*x* reserves the microarchitecture of natural chloroplasts. The microellipsoidal structure not only exhibits high specific surface area ensuring sufficient active sites but also renders good connection among different components enabling fast mass and charge transport in the ORR process.

## **3. Conclusion**

In summary, natural chloroplasts were used as template and porphyrin source to synthesize biomorphic CoNC/CoO*<sup>x</sup>* composite. First, the central Mg ions of chlorophylls were substituted by Co ions with other parts of chloroplasts adsorbed

by Co precursor. Then, biomorphic materials were obtained by calcining the Co-Chl rich chloroplasts in nitrogen atmosphere to different temperatures. Electrochemical measurements demonstrated that 800 °C is an optimum calcining temperature to achieve high ORR activity. The onset potential (0.89 V vs RHE) for CoNC/CoO*x*-800 was only 80 mV negative to that of commercial Pt/C. The half-wave potential (0.82 V vs RHE) and limiting current density (4.94 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> ) were comparable to that of Pt/C. More importantly, the as-synthesized biomorphic material shows superior durability and methanol tolerance than Pt/C. The excellent electrocatalytic performance for ORR should be attributed to the synergistic effect of CoNC and CoO*x* as well as the efficient biomorphic microarchitecture with high specific surface area. This work provides an innovative idea of employing natural chloroplasts as prototype for preparing high-performance ORR catalyst. We believe that the idea of dispersing MNC in microstructured carbon and further loading stable oxide nanograins on the surface would be a worth-trying way to obtain ORR electrocatalyst with both good catalytic activity and stability.

## **4. Experimental Section**

*Extraction of Natural Chloroplasts*: Natural chloroplasts were extracted from fresh spinach leaves according to the method reported in literature.[29] All steps were carried out at 4 °C to maintain the activity of chloroplasts. First, the spinach leaves with petioles and midribs removed were cut into pieces and put into a mortar. Then, ice-cold extracting solution (0.4 mol L−<sup>1</sup> sucrose, 0.05 mol L−<sup>1</sup> Tris-HCl [pH = 7.6], 0.01 mol L−<sup>1</sup> NaCl) was added to the mortar (20–30 mL solution per 10 g leaves), followed by grinding for 2 min to break the mesophylls. After that, the grinded leaf slurry was filtered through four layers of gauze and the green filtrate containing chloroplasts was collected for further extraction procedures. To extract chloroplasts, the filtrate was centrifuged at 300 × *g* for 3 min to remove heavy impurities, such as cell fragments and cell nucleus. Then, chloroplasts were further separated from other organelles by centrifuging the supernatant at 1000 × g for 5 min. The green sediments at the bottom of the centrifuge tube were collected and added to the extracting solution to obtain a chloroplast suspension. The above process was repeated again for purification. At last, the extracted chloroplasts were rinsed in 2.5 wt% glutaraldehyde phosphate buffer solution (PBS; pH = 7.2) at 4 °C for 12 h followed by washing with PBS to fix the microstructure.

*Synthesis of Biomorphic CoNC/CoOx Composite*: The fixed chloroplasts were first soaked in a 5% HCl solution at room temperature for 1 h with the color changing from green to brown. This is because the natural chlorophylls in the chloroplasts transferred to pheophytin with central Mg ions replaced by hydrogen ions. After that, the demagnesium chloroplasts were collected by centrifugation and further dispersed in a methanol solution of 0.02 mol L−<sup>1</sup> Co(CH3COO)2 at 60 °C for 4 h. During this process, Co ions went into the chelating center of the pheophytin to form cobalt-substituted chlorophylls (Co-Chl) with the color changing from brown to green again. The whole color changing process indicated that Co ions have replaced the Mg ions in the original chlorophyll. After repeated washing, the centrifuged solid matter as Co-Chl/chloroplasts were collected and freeze dried for 12 h. Finally, Co-Chl/chloroplasts were further heat treated in N2 atmosphere at 700, 800, and 900 °C for 2 h, respectively, to obtain biomorphic CoNC/CoO*x* composite. At the same time, the original fixed chloroplasts (Mg-Chl/chloroplasts) and demagnesium chloroplasts (H2-Chl/chloroplasts) were also calcined at 800 °C under the same condition for comparison; the obtained samples were ranked as MgNC and NC, respectively. To obtain biomorphic CoNC, the as-synthesized CoNC/CoO*x* composite was further rinsed in 0.5 mol L−<sup>1</sup> H2SO4 solution at room temperature for 24 h followed by washing and drying. What is more, pure CoO*x* sample was also obtained by directly calcining Co(CH3COO)2 in N2 atmosphere to 800 °C and held for 2 h.

*Materials Characterization*: The distribution of chloroplasts in spinach leaves was characterized by observing leaf cross-section slice under laser scanning confocal microscope (LSCM). The detailed preparation process of cross-section slice of spinach leaf is illustrated in Section S1 in the Supporting Information. The structure and morphology of original chloroplasts and as-synthesized materials were examined by field emission scanning electron microscope (NOVA NanoSEM 230) and HRTEM (JEOL JEM-2100F). When characterizing chloroplasts by TEM, ultrathin cross-section slice should be prepared. The detailed process is illustrated in Section S2 in the Supporting Information. Chlorophylls (Mg-Chl), pheophytins (H2-Chl), and Co-substituted chlorophyll derivatives (Co-Chl) extracted from the original or treated chloroplasts by grinding and centrifuging were characterized under UV–vis spectrophotometer (Varian, Cary100Core) and fluorescence spectrometer (Edinburgh, FS5) to demonstrate that Co was successfully introduced to the porphyrin ring center. The composition, crystallinity, and electronic status of the biomorphic samples after calcination were investigated by X-ray diffractometer (XRD, D8 ADVANCE, Cu Kα radiation), Raman spectrometer (Renishaw 2000), and XPS (AXIS UltraDLD). The specific surface area and pore volume were estimated by nitrogen adsorption–desorption (Micromeritics ASAP 2010) via BET and Barrett–Joyner–Halenda method, respectively.

*Electrochemical Measurement*: All electrochemical tests were performed on an electrochemical workstation (Autolab PGSTAT302N) using a three-electrode system with modified glassy carbon RDE (5 mm diameter, 0.2 cm2 area), Ag/AgCl electrode, and Pt sheet as working, reference and auxiliary electrodes, respectively. For working electrode preparation, electrocatalysts were dispersed in 0.2 wt% Nafion solution (water/isopropanol, 4:1 vol ratio) by sonication for at least 30 min to form a homogeneous ink (4 mg mL−<sup>1</sup> ). Then, a 10 µL drop of catalyst ink (containing 0.04 mg catalyst) was cast on RDE, which resulted in a loading of 0.2 mg cm<sup>−</sup>2. All current densities were estimated based on the current signal per area of modified RDE. What is more, commercial Pt/C (20 wt%) was also modified on RDE at a loading of 0.1 mg cm−<sup>2</sup> under the same procedure for comparison. The aqueous solution of 0.1 mol L−<sup>1</sup> KOH was used as electrolyte and bubbled by N2 or O2 prior to each experiment. CV was performed at a scan rate of 50 mV s−<sup>1</sup> Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was conducted at a scan rate of 10 mV s−<sup>1</sup> in O2 saturated electrolyte with rotation speed varied from 400 rpm to 2025 rpm. All potentials in this work were calibrated with respect to RHE and have removed the iR drop. In addition, durability and methanol tolerance tests were carried out by chronoamperometry at 0.6 V versus RHE in O2 saturated electrolyte (1600 rpm).

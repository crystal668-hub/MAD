#### **Abstract**

A defect-rich interconnected hierarchical three-dimensional Fe and N co-doped graphene has been prepared by a facile synthesis with poly (2, 5-benzimidazole) (ABPBI) as nitrogen and carbon sources and CaCO3 as the template. ABPBI possesses abundant nitrogen, and pyrolysis of ABPBI is helpful to form graphene structure. CaCO3 and its decomposition products CO2 can promote the formation of interconnected hierarchical porous three-dimensional graphene, which possesses more defects and exposed active sites. Benefiting from the defective catalysis mechanism, rich defects catalysts are applied as electrode materials to enhance the catalytic performance for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Electrochemically, the half-wave potential (E1/2) of Fe-3D-NG#800 is 0.84 V (vs. RHE), and the accelerated durability tests shows the E1/2 of Fe-3D-NG#800 shifted by a 21 mV drop after cyclic voltammetry scanning for 5000 cycles. Therefore, Fe-3D-NG#800 has excellent activity and durability than 20 wt % Pt/C.

#### Introduction

In recent years, energy consumption has rapidly increased with the development of world economies.<sup>[1]</sup> The problems of environmental pollution, energy crisis and global climate warming, need to be resolved immediately.<sup>[2]</sup> Fuel cells as the promising energy conversion equipment have attracted a tremendous attention for its high conversion efficiency, high energy density and environmental friendliness.<sup>[3]</sup> Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is the most important process in fuel cells.<sup>[4]</sup> However, the sluggish ORR kinetics could lead to high overpotential at the cathode, which would further lead to the efficiency reduction of fuel cells.<sup>[5]</sup> Therefore, the development of efficient cathode electrocatalysts for ORR is crucial for fuel cells technology. Up to date, Platinum (Pt)-based and its alloys are the most extensively used cathode catalysts for ORR owing to their high electrocatalytic activity and excellent selectivity.<sup>[6]</sup> However, the prohibitive cost and scarcity hinder their large-scale commercial applications. Therefore, non-precious metal catalysts are gaining research interest over the years.

At present, non-precious metal electrocatalysts mainly include transition metal oxides,<sup>[7]</sup> transition metal macrocyclic compounds,<sup>[8]</sup> metal nitrogen-doped carbon (M-N-C) <sup>[9]</sup> and carbon-based metal-free electrocatalysts, <sup>[10]</sup> etc. Among these non-precious metal catalysts, M-N-C catalysts exhibit great potential in the application of fuel cells for their excellent catalytic performance for ORR.<sup>[11]</sup> In addition, M-N-C materials have been also widely used in other fields, such as H<sub>2</sub>S selective catalytic oxidation, Hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction.<sup>[12]</sup> The metal atoms of M-N-C catalysts are ordinarily coordinated with four

atoms in the same plane (N atoms in most cases) to form M–N–C sites.[13] The carbon skeleton provides electronic conductivity, large surface area and high pore volume for mass transport, while the sites of M-N-C interact with the ORR feedstocks. [14] In particular, Fe-N-C catalysts with Fe and N doping into carbon materials have attracted extensive attention because of their excellent electrocatalytic performance.[15] Based on the defective catalysis mechanism, many of defective carbon-based have been developed. [16] Defect sites of graphene have been reported to be active for ORR, which is attributed to heteroatoms doped graphene, vacancies, graphene edges and oxygen-containing functional groups. [17] It is widely known that N doped graphene (NG) suffers abundant defects, which is beneficial to enhance reactant deposition on carbon materials.[10c] However, the van der Waals and π−π interaction between the graphene sheets can lead to irreversible stacking and aggregation, which reduce the oxygen catalytic performance of Fe-N-C catalysts.[18] To overcome this problem, three-dimensional N-doped graphene (3D-NG) provides a state-of-the-art strategy. Compared with the graphene, 3D-NG has more defects, which is attributed to 3D porous structure possessed and external defects formed by heteroatoms. More defects of 3D-NG are conducive to boost reactant deposition on the graphene surface and avoid graphene agglomeration.[19] In addition, 3D-NG with abundant porous possesses more exposed active sites and high specific surface area, which is beneficial to improve the catalytic performance for ORR.[20] Therefore, three-dimensional Fe-N doped graphene (Fe-3D-NG) is a promising electrocatalyst for ORR.

Up to now, the low-cost and N-riched precursor is the key to prepare

high-performance Fe-N-C catalysts for ORR.[21] Polybenzimidazoles (PBIs) are heterocyclic polymers containing benzimidazole moieties in their backbone. Among PBI structure derivatives, poly (2, 5-benzimidazole) (ABPBI) has attracted much attention. The structural features of ABPBI: (1) a large π bond could be formed in the whole ABPBI molecule, (2) the solution of ABPBI can be uniformly coated on the surface of the templating agent, thereby forming a π-π stacked coating layer and (3) graphene structures can be readily available during the pyrolysis, dehydrogenation, cyclization and carbonization of ABPBI. CaCO3 (50 nm) which possessed many advantages is used as the template. First, the large-scale reserves of CaCO3 on the earth are very cheap. Second, the pyrolysis of nano-CaCO3 (50 nm) could produce CaO and CO2. The obtained CaO as the template can promote the formation of micropore and mesopore. The escape of CO2 can facilitate the formation of micropore to promote interconnected hierarchical porous graphene structure. Finally, the template is easy to remove after carbonization.

In this work, a simple and comparatively inexpensive APPBI was used as the precursor, which has abundant nitrogen and easy to form graphene structure through high-temperature dehydrogenation and carbonization. The synthesis route of Fe-3D-NG#800 was shown in Figure 1. The as-prepared Fe-3D-NG had the intrinsic properties of graphene with a big π bond, and its interconnected hierarchical porous structure possesses more defects and active sites, which is beneficial to facilitate mass transfer and conductivity performance for improving the catalytic activity of ORR.

#### **Results and Discussion**

Figure 2a showed the XRD pattern of Fe-3D-NG#800. A broad peak was at approximately 25°, which can be corresponded to the (002) plane, indicated that Fe-3D-NG#800 was piled in a corrugated structure. The diffraction peaks at around 43° indicated the low degree of graphitization.[22] It was notable that no other peaks of crystalline phases were observed, meaning that there were no large crystallites of Fe containing species. [9b, 23] The XRD result confirmed the amorphous character of Fe-3D-NG#800. The morphology and structural insights were examined by SEM and TEM. The SEM images of 3D-NG and Fe-3D-NG#800 were shown in Figure S1 (a, b). It was observed that 3D-NG and Fe-3D-NG#800 possessed the nanosheet porous structure. The nanosheet structure was attributed to the pyrolysis of ABPBI, and the porous structure was due to the removal of the CaCO3 or CaO template. The TEM images of 3D-NG and Fe-3D-NG#800 were shown in Figure 2 (b, c). As shown in figure 2b, it can be seen that 3D-NG exhibited a continuous foam-like porous structure. As shown in figure 2c, Fe-3D-NG#800 possessed an evident multilayer graphene structure. This result proved that pyrolysis of ABPBI was helpful to form graphene structure through high-temperature dehydrogenation and carbonization. As shown in Figure 2 (d, e), the HRTEM images showed that 3D-NG and Fe-3D-NG#800 possessed typical wrinkled bore walls and thin multilayer graphene structure. In Figure 2e, it can be seen that Fe-3D-NG#800 possessed interconnected hierarchical porous structure. The pore size was approximately 50 nm, which was in agreement with the particle size of template CaCO3 (50 nm). 3D-NG and Fe-3D-NG#800 had 3D porous structure, which was beneficial to improve mass transfer thereafter improved catalytic ORR performances. In addition, no lattice planes can be observed such as metallic iron, Fe2N, Fe3N, FeC, etc., indicating that Fe existed in another form. [24] The result was in good agreement with the XRD in Figure 2a.

As observed in Figure 3 (a-f), EDX mapping analysis was used to demonstrate

elemental distribution in Fe-3D-NG#800. As shown in Figure 3a, it was typical STEM images of Fe-3D-NG#800. It was observed that Fe-3D-NG#800 possessed 3D porous graphene structure. As shown in Figure 3 (b-f), Fe, N, O and C were all uniformly dispersed throughout the surface of Fe-3D-NG#800. These four elementals overlapped perfectly with each other, demonstrating that Fe could bond with N to form the Fe-Nx coordination sites. The EDAX spectrum of Fe-3D-NG#800 further proved the existence of Fe, N, O and C in Figure 3g.

The TG-DTG and TG-DSC curves of ABPBI are shown in Figure S2 (a, b). In Figure S2, the weight loss between room temperature and 150 °C was 0.7%, corresponding to the endothermic peak on the TG-DTG curve which was due to the loss of bound water. The weight loss at 150~300 °C was 2.5%, corresponding to the endothermic peak of TG-DSC curve, which was caused by decomposition and decarboxylation of low molecular polymers. The weight loss at 300~580 °C was 23%, corresponding to rapid weight loss on TG-DTG curve (Figure S2 (a)) and strong exothermic peak on TG-DSC curve (Figure S2 (b)), which was caused by decomposition of polymer end groups. The weight loss at 580~800 °C was mainly caused by the decomposition of the polymerized main chain. The glass transition temperature (Tg) of ABPBI was 567 °C according to the DSC curve (Figure S2 (b)).

The Raman spectra (Figure 4a) of Fe-3D-NG#700, Fe-3D-NG#800, Fe-3D-NG#900 and 3D-NG had representative bands at 1350 cm-1 (D band) and 1590 cm-1 (G band), which was attributed to the defective graphitic structures and sp<sup>2</sup> – hybridized graphitic carbon atom, respectively. [25] The intensity mass ratio of ID/IG should generally correspond to the defects degree of graphene.[26] The calculated ID/IG ratios of Fe-3D-NG#700, Fe-3D-NG#800, Fe-3D-NG#900 and 3D-NG were 1.02, 1.10, 1.06 and 0.97, respectively. The ID/IG ratio of Fe-3D-NG#800 was higher than Fe-3D-NG#700 and Fe-3D-NG#900, demonstrating that the temperature of pyrolysis affected the defect degree of the catalyst. Moreover, Fe-3D-NG#800 and 3D-NG were pyrolyed at 800 °C. The ID/IG ratio of Fe-3D-NG#800 was 1.10, which was much higher than 3D-NG (0.97). The result demonstrated that Fe doping 3D-NG could promote more formation of defects.

The elemental composition and surface structure of Fe-3D-NG#800 was analyzed by XPS. Figure 4b exhibited the presence and composition of Fe, N, O and C elements. The atomic ratios of Fe, N, O and C were 1.46, 7.04, 14.07 and 76.03%, respectively. In the Fe2p spectra (Figure 4c), five peaks were located at 711.1, 713.3, 718.6, 724.1 and 731.5 eV, respectively. The peak at 711.1 eV implied the existence of the Fe−Nx bond. The peak of Fe2p3/2 was suggested at 713.3 eV, and the satellite

located at 718.6 eV. The peak of Fe2p1/2 was suggested at 724.1 eV, and the satellite located at 731.5 eV. Figure 4d showed the high-resolution N1s spectra of Fe-3D-NG#800. There were five peaks, corresponding to pyridinic N (398.1 eV), Fe-Nx (399.2 eV), pyrrole N (400.2 eV), graphitic N (401.1 eV) and oxidized-N (402.8 eV), respectively.[23-24] The Fe−Nx bond as the active sites had a significant effect for ORR, which was beneficial to enhance the catalytic ORR performance. In Figure 4e, the XPS spectra of O1s had three O species: Fe-O (531.1 eV), O=C (532.1 eV) and C-OH (533.1 eV). [27] In C1s spectrum (Figure 4f), there were four peaks located at 289.8, 286.9, 285.8 and 284.6, which can be attributed to O-C=O, C=O/C-N, C-O/C=N and C=C, respectively.[23] The above results corresponded with the result of TEM, demonstrating that Fe had doped in the N-containing graphene sheets and coordinated with N atoms to form the Fe−Nx active sites.

10 The pore size distribution and specific surface area of 3D-NG and Fe-3D-NG#800 were characterized by BET and N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms. As shown in Figure 5(a, b), the N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms showed type I and type IV, indicating that 3D-NG and Fe-3D-NG#800 possessed micropore and mesopore structures. [28] The BET surface area of 3D-NG and Fe-3D-NG#800 were 871 m<sup>2</sup> g-1 and 1052 m<sup>2</sup> g-1 , respectively. Figure 5(c, d) showed the pore size distribution of 3D-NG and Fe-3D-NG#800. The mesopore size ranged from 30 to 50 nm of 3D-NG and Fe-3D-NG#800. The micropore size ranged from 0.4 to 1 nm of 3D-NG, and the micropore size ranged from 0.2 to 1 nm of Fe-3D-NG#800. The presence of the mesopore structure was ascribed to the presence of CaCO3 (50 nm) template. The micropore structure was produced by the escape of CO2. The above results demonstrated the CaCO3 (50 nm) template could generate the interconnected micropore and mesopore structure throughout high-temperature carbonization process. 3D-NG and Fe-3D-NG#800 with high surface area and interconnected porous structure had more defects, which could provide more active sites and improve mass transport for enhancing the catalytic ORR performance.

The catalytic activities of all samples were investigated by RDE measurements in O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH solution. As shown in Figure S3, Fe-3D-NG#800 had no ORR activity in N2-saturated electrolyte. In comparison, it had a distinct ORR peak in the O2-saturated electrolyte, indicating apparent catalytic activity for ORR. Figure 6a showed the LSV curves of Fe-3D-NG#800, Fe-3D-NG#900, Fe-3D-NG#700, 3D-NG and 20 wt % Pt/C. The onset potential (Eonset) of Fe-3D-NG#800 (0.97 V vs. RHE) was better than those of Fe-3D-NG#900 (0.96 V vs. RHE), Fe-3D-NG#700 (0.93V vs. RHE), 3D-NG (0.90 V vs. RHE) and could be comparable with 20 wt % Pt/C (0.97 V vs. RHE). The half-wave potential (E1/2) of Fe-3D-NG#800 was 0.84 V vs. RHE,

which was better than those of Fe-3D-NG#900 (0.82 V vs. RHE), Fe-3D-NG#700 (0.81V vs. RHE), 3D-NG (0.77 V vs. RHE) and 20 wt % Pt/C (0.83 V vs. RHE). These results indicated that Fe-3D-NG#800 had the best electrocatalytic activity for ORR. Fe had doped in the N-containing graphene, which could improve the catalytic ORR activity of the catalyst, and the Fe-Nx sites played a critical role in ORR activity. Moreover, the Fe-3D-NG heat-treated at 800 °C possessed the best ORR activities. In order to gain ORR kinetics of the catalysts, the corresponding Koutecky−Levich (K-L) plots of 3D-NG, Fe-3D-NG#700, Fe-3D-NG#800 and Fe-3D-NG#900 were shown in Figure S4. These K-L plots exhibited remarkable linearity at various potentials from 0.4 to 0.7 V vs RHE. The electron transfer numbers of Fe-3D-NG#800, Fe-3D-NG#900, Fe-3D-NG#700 and 3D-NG at different potentials were measured in Figure 6b. The electron transfer numbers of Fe-3D-NG#800, Fe-3D-NG#900, Fe-3D-NG#700 and 3D-NG were 3.92, 3.78, 3.81 and 3.47 at 0.7 V vs. RHE, respectively, and the number of electrons transferred were 3.97, 3.89, 3.93 and 3.81 at 0.5V vs. RHE, respectively. The results indicated that Fe-3D-NG#800 had excellent selectivity for ORR. The Tafel slopes showed the mechanistics and ORR kinetics of catalysts. As shown in Figure 6c, the lower tafel slope of Fe-3D-NG#800, Fe-3D-NG#900, Fe-3D-NG#700, 3D-NG and 20 wt % Pt/C were 62.2, 69.6, 73.4, 84.9 and 63.8 mV dec-1 , respectively. The lowest Tafel slope of Fe-3D-NG#800 possessed the fastest process of catalytic ORR kinetic. In order to investigate the active sites of Fe in Fe-3D-NG, the poison experiment of the Fe−Nx bonds was tested with 0.1 M HClO4 containing 0.05 M KSCN. As shown in Figure 6d, the E1/2 of

Fe-3D-NG#800 had decreased 44 mV after the HClO4 was added to 0.1 M KOH solution. When the SCN− ions had been completely removed, the catalytic activity of Fe-3D-NG#800 was basically the same as initial catalytic performance. This result demonstrated that Fe formed Fe−Nx active sites, which played the crucial role for ORR catalytic activity. Moreover, the electrocatalytic activity of Fe-3D-NG#800 compared with other M-N-C catalysts in literature was presented in table S1. All of the data were tested in 0.1 M KOH solution. The catalytic ORR performance of Fe-3D-NG#800 was superior to that of literature reported catalysts. The above results demonstrated the superior ORR activity of Fe-3D-NG#800, which was ascribed to the defect-rich interconnected hierarchical porous graphene structure. The characterization and poison experiment results showed that there are three types of defects in Fe-3D-NG structure: (1) edge defects resulted from foamy graphene, (2) heteroatom defects caused by Fe-N-doped graphene, (3) coordination defects formed by Fe-Nx bond. In addition, the molecule of ABPBI contains a large amount of imidazole nitrogen, which is easy to form Fe-N4 with Fe by pyrolysis. However, poisoning experiments of KSCN showed that the active center of catalyst is an iron phthalocyanine-like Fe-N4 structure.

(d) LSV curves of Fe-3D-NG#800 in the O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH electrolyte (with and without 0.05 M KSCN) at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 .

The ORR durability tests of Fe-3D-NG#800 and 20 wt % Pt/C were measured by the ADT and chronoamperometry tests in 0.1 M KOH solution. The E1/2 of Fe-3D-NG#800 shifted by a 21 mV drop after cyclic voltammetry scanning for 5000 cycles in Figure 7a. As shown in Figure 7b, the E1/2 of 20 wt % Pt/C shifted by a 29 mV, which was higher than that of Fe-3D-NG#800 (8 mV) under same conditions. As shown in Figure 7c, the current density of Fe-3D-NG#800 had a 13.5% loss after 70000 s. In comparison, the current density of 20 wt % Pt/C had a 22.1% loss after 70000 s in Figure 7d. Obviously, the above results demonstrated that Fe-3D-NG#800 possessed better durability than 20 wt % Pt/C. The excellent durability was attributed to the interaction between Fe-Nx and big π bond of graphene.

#### **Conclusions**

The efficient defect-rich Fe-3D-NG electrocatalysts for ORR were synthesized by a CaCO3 template method and pyrolysis process. A simple and comparatively inexpensive ABPBI was used as the precursor, which has abundant nitrogen and easy to form graphene structure through high-temperature dehydrogenation and carbonization. Analyzing the results of TEM, Raman, XPS and poison experiment, there are three types of defects in Fe-3D-NG structure, including edge defects, heteroatom defects and coordination defects. Fe was bonded with N to form Fe-Nx active sites. The Fe-Nx active sites played crucial role for the catalytic performance. Moreover, Fe-3D-NG#800 possessed interconnected hierarchical porous structure of graphene. Fe-3D-NG heat-treated at 800 °C possessed the best ORR activity. In addition, Fe-3D-NG#800 also possessed better durability than 20 wt % Pt/C. Fe-3D-NG with interconnected hierarchical porous structure possessed more defects and active sites, which is beneficial to facilitate mass transfer and conductivity performance for improving the catalytic activity of ORR.

Commercial Pt/C was bought from American E-TEK Company.

#### **Preparation of ABPBI**

ABPBI was synthesized by DABA self-polycondensation. In a typical process, 10 g of DABA was placed into a mortar. After grinding by pestle, the powder was then moved into a round-bottom flask and purged with nitrogen gas for 15 min. The temperature of the solid powder was slowly increased to 225 °C and maintained for 3 h under constant nitrogen flow, and then the temperature was further increased to 275 °C for 3 h. The resulting black-brown solid, when cooled to room temperature, was ground into powder and denoted as ABPBI (approximately 1.3 g). The reaction equation of ABPBI was shown in Figure S5.

#### **Preparation of Fe-3D-NG**

2 g of FeCl3 ·6H2O and 2g of ABPBI were dissolved in N, N-dimethyl acetamide (20 mL), respectively. 4 g of CaCO3 dispersed in N, N-dimethyl acetamide (20 mL). These three mixtures were mixed and dispersed evenly. After forming homogeneous solution, these three solutions were mixed and transferred to a conical flask and then heated reflux condenser at 140 °C for 4 h, followed by rotary evaporation to a paste at 100 °C. The resulting powder was pyrolyzed under an N2 atmosphere for 2 h at 700 °C, 800 °C and 900 °C, respectively. These samples were denoted as Fe-3D-NG#700**,** Fe-3D-NG#800 and Fe-3D-NG#900, respectively. Then, the obtained samples were cooled to room temperature naturally and washed extensively by HCl solution and deionized water to remove impurities. The 3D-NG synthesis processes in supporting information.

#### **Physical characterizations**

The morphology of the samples was studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (SIRION, Netherlands FEI) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, FEI Tecnai G2 20 S-TWIN, 200 keV). The surface of the catalyst was characterized by XPS on a PHI-5300 ESCA spectrometer (Perkin Elmer Instruments, Waltham, MA). Raman spectra were characterized on a LabRAM HR Evolution Raman spectrometer (HORIMA Company) with a laser excitation wavelength of 532 nm. The Barrett-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area was characterized by N2 adsorption/desorption on a TriStar II 3020 instrument.

#### **Electrochemical Characterization**

The activity of the catalyst was evaluated by rotating disk electrode (RDE) which was implemented on an Electrochemical Workstation (CHI 660C; CH Instruments, Shanghai, China). An Hg/HgO and a graphite plate were used as the reference and counter, respectively. The glassy carbon disk (the surface area was 0.1075 cm-2 ) was used as the working electrode. All of the inks were prepared as follows: a finely ground 3 mg of catalyst was ultrasonically dispersed in 1 mL of ethanol and 0.01 mL of 5 wt % Nafion solution with ultrasonication for 30 min. Then, 15 μL of ink was pipetted and spreaded onto the working electrode. The loading mass of the catalyst was 276 μg/ cm-2 . All potentials were converted to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) in this work. The Nernst equation follows: ERHE = EHg/HgO+0.098 V+ 0.059 PH. Electrochemical measurements were conducted in O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH solution at 25 °C at a sweep rate of 5 mV s-1 . Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was carried out

by RDE under different rotation rates (625, 900, 1225, 1600, 2025 rpm). The durability experiments were carried out for Fe-3D-NG#800 and 20 wt % Pt/C with the accelerated durability test (ADT) and chronoamperometry tests (rotation rate: 1600 rpm).

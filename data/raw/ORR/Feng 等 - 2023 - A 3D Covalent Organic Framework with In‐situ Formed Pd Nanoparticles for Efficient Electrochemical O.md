Non-platinum noble metals are highly desirable for the development of highly active, stable oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysts for fuel cells and metal-air batteries. However, how to improve the utilization of non-platinum noble metals is an urgent issue. Herein, a highly efficient catalyst for ORR was prepared through homogeneous loading of Pd precursors by a domain-limited method in a three-dimensional covalent organic framework (COF) followed by pyrolysis. The morphology of the Pd nanoparticles (Pd NPs) was well maintained after carbonization, which was attributed to the

rigid structure of the 3D COF. Thanks to the uniform distribution of Pd NPs in the carbon, the catalyst exhibited a remarkable half-wave potential of 0.906 V and a Tafel slope of 70 mV dec<sup>-1</sup> in 0.1 M KOH, surpassing the commercial Pt/C catalyst (0.863 V and 75 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>). Furthermore, a maximum power density of 144.0 mW cm<sup>-2</sup> was achieved at 252 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, which was significantly higher than the control battery (105.1 mW cm<sup>-2</sup>). This work not only provides a simple strategy for in-situ preparation of highly dispersible metal catalysts in COFs, but also offers new insights into the ORR electrocatalysis.

#### Introduction

Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is a crucial electrochemical process in fuel cells and rechargeable metal-air cells, making it essential for the exploration of renewable energy sources.[1] Platinum is a highly effective catalyst for ORR, but its high cost and limited availability restrict its application. [2] Compared with platinum, palladium (Pd) is more abundant in natural reserves and less expensive, and has similar adsorption and desorption energies to platinum with high ORR activity.[3] Another limitation of ORR is the utilization efficiency of Pd. The low utilization efficiency of Pd also leads to high cost. Therefore, improving the utilization of Pd while ensuring high activity and stability is critical. To solve this problem, a promising approach is to disperse the ultrafine Pd nanoparticles (Pd NPs) on suitable carriers with large surface area and highly ordered porous structure. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as a crystalline porous material, could stabilize the metal NPs in the pore channel, and controlling the uniform distribution of particle size.<sup>[4]</sup> However, the poor structural stability of MOFs have limited their applications in electrocatalysis. [5]

Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are a type of crystalline organic polymers with periodic porous network structure, offering high surface area, chemical and thermal stability, and well-defined porous channels. [6] For ORR electrocatalysis, recent studies have demonstrated the feasibility of COFs used as catalyst carriers.[7] The main strategy is to load the metal catalyst into the pre-synthesized COFs (Scheme 1), [8] which has been commonly used for two-dimensional (2D) COFs to prepare ORR catalysts. However, the use of metal catalysts to modify presynthesis COFs tends to cause uneven dispersion and size of the metal nanoparticles (NPs). And the one-dimensional (1D) pores of the 2D COFs are not conducive to mass transfer in

ORR,[9] that limits the application of 2D COFs in ORR. In contrast, three-dimensional (3D) COFs exist interconnected pore structures, where the interconnected pores are more conducive to mass transfer. On the other hand, the cage-like cavities of 3D COFs enable the encapsulation of metal NPs so that the metal NPs cannot be easily fall off, allowing them to exhibit superior performance in ORR catalysis.[10] The in-situ synthesis strategy is to encapsulate the metal NPs during the synthesis process, which is simple and could achieve uniform dispersion of the metal NPs.

Herein, we report an in-situ synthesis strategy through insitu encapsulation of Pd NPs in 3D COF, followed by carbonization to prepare an efficient electrocatalyst for ORR. This approach yields a porous carbon material (Pd@NC) with a uniform distribution of Pd NPs, resulting in abundant active sites for ORR. The Pd@NC catalyst exhibits a high half-wave potential of 0.906 V and a maximum power density of 144.0 mWcm <sup>2</sup> , making it an ideal candidate for application in fuel cells and metal-air batteries.

## **Results and Discussion**

The 3D COF (named TB-COF) was synthesized by 3,3',5,5' tetrakis(4-formylphenyl)bimesityl (TFBM) and 4',5'-bis(4-aminophenyl)-[1,1':2',1''-terphenyl]-4,4''-diamine (BATD) in 1,2-dichlorobenzene and 1-butanol with 6 M acetic acid at 120°C for 3 d by dehydration condensation reaction (Figure 1a). The chemical structure of the TB-COF was determined through various analytical techniques. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) clearly evidenced the formation of C=N bond (1629 cm <sup>1</sup> ) and the disappearance of C=O bond (1693 cm <sup>1</sup> ) and N H

bond (3350 cm <sup>1</sup> ) in TB-COF (Figure 1b), indicating the complete consumption of the raw materials during the polymerization process.[11] Solid-state 13C cross-polarization magic-anglespinning NMR spectroscopy further confirmed the imine linkages in TB-COF (Figure 1c), with chemical shift at 157 ppm assigned to the imine carbons.[12] Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) revealed that TB-COF and Pd@TB-COF were thermally stable up to 530 °C (Figure S1, Supporting Information).

The crystal structure of TB-COF was characterized by the powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) measurement in conjunction with structural simulations. The PXRD pattern of TB-COF (black line) exhibited an intense peak at 6.35° and four small at 4.50°, 9.07°, 10.07° and 12.64°. The sharp diffraction peaks indicate long range structural ordering and high crystallinity. The structure of TB-COF (unit cell parameters: *a*=41.216 Å, *b*= 4.927 Å, *c*=40.237 Å, *α*=*γ*=90°, and *β*=89.943°) was obtained by Rietveld refinement with acceptable low residuals *Rp*= 4.26% and *Rwp*=3.12% (Figure 1d, Table S1, Supporting Information). The tetrahedral *T4* building blocks (TFBM) with four joint points and the square *C4* units (BATD) with four joint points form a **pts** topology. The **pts** topology with *C2/c* space group was determined through the geometrical energy minimization using Materials Studio (Figure 1e). After considering different folds (1-fold, 3-fold, 5-fold, 7-fold) of interpenetrated **pts** nets (Figure S2, Supporting Information), the 7-fold interpolation of TB-COF is consistent with the PXRD pattern (Figure 1f). The TB-COF existed the 15.6 Å hexagonal pores and 12.2 Å quadrilateral pores along the *b* axis (Figure 1g).

After the structure of TB-COF was clarified, an in-situ synthesis strategy was developed to encapsulate Pd NPs. The preparation of Pd NPs often involves the pyrolysis of Pd (II) precursors, such as Pd(acac)2 (acac=acetylacetonate),[13] in the presence of Lewis acid, which promotes the formation of Pd NPs (Figure 2a).[14] Thus, we verified the possibility of reduction of Pd(acac)2 to palladium during COF synthesis (Figure 2b, Figure S3, Supporting Information). The synthesis strategy insitu encapsulated Pd NPs (named Pd@TB-COF) as shown in Figure 2c. It was synthesized by TFBM, BATD and Pd(acac)2 in 1,2-dichlorobenzene and 1-butanol with 6 M acetic acid at 120°C for 3 d.

To verify the feasibility of the strategy, we traced the synthesis process of Pd@TB-COF using PXRD and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). In the initial stage of the reaction (12 h), there was no diffraction peaks of TB-COF formation (the green line in Figure 2d), but Pd NPs were formed. Notably, the size of the Pd NPs was heterogeneous (Figure S5a, Supporting Information). When the reaction proceeded to 24 h, the size of Pd NPs gradually increased and became more uniform. At this

point, the diffraction peak of TB-COF appeared at 6.35°, indicated that the ordered TB-COF structure was formed gradually (Figure S4, Supporting Information). At the end of the reaction (72 h), the characteristic peaks of TB-COF appeared, and the characteristic peaks of Pd NPs were enhanced. Also, the Pd NPs had reached a size of approximately 12 nm, and a uniform layer of TB-COF had coated the surface of Pd NPs (Figure S5, Supporting Information). The size of Pd NPs increased from 6.25 to 12 nm, it indicates that the Pd NPs are not entering the pore channels of TB-COF but encapsulated by TB-COF. We also investigated the effect of different Pd(acac)2 additions (6 mg, 8 mg, and 10 mg) on the size of Pd NPs. The results showed no significant effect of different Pd(acac)2 additions on the size of Pd NPs (Figure S6, Supporting Information).

FTIR characterization confirmed the formation of Pd@TB-COF by indicating the presence of C=N bond at 1629 cm <sup>1</sup> (Figure 2e). The N2 adsorption-desorption measurement showed that the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller surface area of TB-COF was 1490.78 m<sup>2</sup> g <sup>1</sup> while it was 637.57 m<sup>2</sup> g <sup>1</sup> for Pd@TB-COF (Figure 2f). The decrease in specific surface area of Pd@TB-COF further indicates that Pd NPs was encapsulated in TB-COF and occupied some pore channels of TB-COF. Notably, the pore size distribution profile indicates that TB-COF and Pd@TB-COF possess only micropores with sizes about 1.08 nm (Figure S7, Supporting Information), which are consistent with theoretical pore width.

The carbonized Pd@TB-COF (named Pd@NC) was obtained by pyrolysis of Pd@TB-COF at 900°C under N2 atmosphere for 2 h (Figure 3a). The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and TEM were used to further study the morphology of Pd@TB-COF, and Pd@NC. The SEM images show that the size of Pd@NC shrunk slightly after carbonization, but the morphology did not change significantly, which is attributed to the rigid structure of TB-COF (Figure S8, Supporting Information). Notably, the TEM images show uniformly dispersed Pd NPs, confirming the feasibility of the in-situ coating strategy (Figure 3b and Figure 3e). And the size of Pd NPs remained unchanged (approximately 12 nm, Figure S4c and Figure S9, Supporting Information) after carbonization (Figure 3c and 3f). The TEM images reveal clear lattice fringe of 0.221 nm, corresponding to the simulated model of the (111) face of Pd NPs (Figure 3d and 3 g).[15] The (111) crystal face of Pd NPs did not change after carbonization. In addition, the EDS mapping images confirmed

the presence of C, N, O and Pd elements in Pd@NC (Figure S10, Supporting Information).

The XRD patterns show the characteristic peaks of Pd@TB-COF and Pd@NC (Figure 3h). The red line is the XRD pattern of Pd@TB-COF, showing strong characteristic peaks of TB-COF and Pd NPs. The black line is the XRD pattern of Pd@NC, where the disappearance of the TB-COF characteristic peak and the appearance of the characteristic peak of the carbon (2θ=22.5°) can be clearly seen (Figure S11, Supporting Information), and the characteristic peaks of Pd at 2θ=40.11° and 46.66° were maintained, corresponding to the (111) and (200) crystal planes of Pd. In addition, the generation of intense and sharp peaks in the Raman spectrum indicates the formation of carbon defects (Figure S12, Supporting Information). The surface chemistry and composition of Pd@TB-COF and Pd@NC were analyzed by XPS, revealing the presence of N and Pd elements. The N 1s signals of Pd@TB-COF at 399.3 and 398.7 eV were ascribed to C=N and NH2, respectively (Figure S13c, Supporting Information). In contrast, the N 1s signals of Pd@NC showed four peaks: oxidized pyridinic (402.1 eV), graphitic (401.4 eV), pyrrolic (400.4 eV), and pyridinic N (398.6 eV) (Figure S11f, Supporting Information).[16] The peaks of Pd 3d3/2 and 3d5/2 at 342.9 and 337.7 eV for Pd@TB-COF correspond to the Pd (II) species, while the peaks of Pd 3d3/2 and 3d5/2 at 341.0 and 335.6 eV belong to the Pd (0) species (Figure 3i). For Pd@NC, Pd (II) (342.4 and 337.0 eV of Pd 3d3/2 and 3d5/2) and Pd (0) (340.9 and 335.6 eV of Pd 3d3/2 and 3d5/2) were observed (Figure 3j).[17]

Considering the homogeneous dispersion of Pd NPs, the electrocatalytic activities of Pd@NC for ORR was measured in a three-electrode system with a rotating disk electrode (RDE) in an O2-saturated KOH solution (0.1 M) at room temperature. For comparison, TB-COF, Pd@TB-COF, and TB-COF-NC were also studied for ORR. As shown by the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves (Figure 4a), the half-wave potential of Pd@NC is 0.906 V vs. RHE (Figure 4b), which is much higher than those of TB-COF (0.431 V), Pd@TB-COF (0.436 V), TB-COF-NC (0.620 V), and Pt/C (0.863 V). The electron transfer kinetics of Pd@NC was then studied by the Tafel plots. As shown in Figure 4c, Pd@NC possesses the lowest Tafel slope of 70 mVdec <sup>1</sup> , demonstrating the fast ORR kinetics. The enhanced kinetics of the Pd@NC may be due to the change in electronic structure, which promotes the adsorption and desorption of oxygen and its intermediates. To maximize the performance of the catalyst, catalysts with different metal loadings (6 mg, 8 mg, and 10 mg) were prepared, named Pd@NC-6, Pd@NC, Pd@NC-10, also, the Pd@TB-COF with 20% carbon black (Figures S14 and S15, Supporting Information). The rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) was used to reveal the reaction mechanism. The electron transfer number (n) was calculated to be around 3.9, indicating a four-electron pathway (Figure S16, Supporting Information). The curve radius of the Pd@NC measured by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) demonstrated that the Pd@NC was favorable for a small charge transfer resistance (Figure S17, Supporting Information). In addition, the Pd@NC presented remarkable stability with a reduction of 14.6% during 20000 s (Figure S18, Supporting Information).

Due to the excellent catalytic performance of Pd@NC in ORR, we explored its practical applications. A zinc-air cell was assembled, where the zinc plate was used as anode, Pd@NC or Pt/C catalyst loaded on commercial gas diffusion layer as the air cathode, and 6 M KOH containing 0.2 M zinc acetate as the electrolyte. The open circuit potential of the Zinc-air battery (ZAB) is 1.47 V (Figure 4d), very close to that of Pt/C (1.42 V). The discharge polarization and power density curves were

displayed in Figure 4e. The max power density of 144.0 mWcm <sup>2</sup> is reached at 252 mAcm <sup>2</sup> , which are much larger than those (1.42 V and 105.1 mWcm <sup>2</sup> ) of the control battery, making Pd@NC competitive for practical applications. Figure 4f shows the galvanostatic discharge curves of the Zn-air batteries. The discharge plateau slowlydecreases with current density from 2 to 20 mAcm <sup>2</sup> . The Pd@NC ZAB delivers higher discharge voltages of 1.24, 1.21, 1.17, and 1.10 V at the current densities of 2, 5, 10, and 20 mAcm <sup>2</sup> , respectively, than those of the Pt/C-based ZAB. In addition, the discharge recovery was reversible when the current density reduced to 2 mAcm <sup>2</sup> , which indicates the remarkable discharge rate performance and good reversibility of the Pd@NC-based zinc-air battery. The inset images in Figure 4f further displays that two of the Pd@NCbased ZABs in series can power a light-emitting diode. In addition, the long-term stability test showed the Pd@NC catalyst exhibited superior stability compared to the commercial Pt/C (Figure S19, Supporting Information). These results confirm the high catalytic activity of Pd@NC, which is superior to the other reported catalysts (Table S2, Supporting Information).

#### **Conclusions**

In summary, we reported a synthesis strategy through in-situ encapsulation of Pd NPs in 3D TB-COF, followed with carbonization treatment. This synthetic strategy resulted in the in-situ formation of uniformly dispersed Pd NPs with homogeneous size. Thanks to the uniform dispersion and homogeneous size of Pd NPs, the Pd@NC shows excellent ORR properties. Specifically, the catalyst exhibited a remarkable half-wave potential of 0.906 V and demonstrated a maximum power density of 144.0 mWcm <sup>2</sup> . This work not only provides a simple strategy for the preparation of highly conductive COFs-loaded ORR electrocatalysts, but also provides a new exploration for the practical application of fuel cells and metal-air cells.

#### **Experimental Section**

**Reagents**: n-Butanol (n-BuOH), 1,2-Dichlorbenzol (o-DCB) and Bis(2,4-pentanedionato) palladium (II) (Pd(acac)2) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The 3,3',5,5'-tetrakis(4-formylphenyl)bimesityl (TFBM) and 4',5'-Bis(4-aminophenyl)-[1,1':2',1''-terphenyl]-4,4''-diamine (BATD) were synthesized according to the published literature.[18] All commercially available starting compounds and solvents were purchased from commercial sources and used without further purification.

**Synthesis and characterizations of TB-COF**: The TB-COF was synthesized by solvothermal condensation reaction. A Pyrex tube was charged with TFBM (13.1 mg, 0.02 mmol), BATD (8.8 mg, 0.02 mmol), o-DCB (1.8 mL), n-BuOH (0.2 mL) and 6 M aqueous acetic acid (0.2 mL). The mixture was sonicated for 30 min to get a homogeneous dispersion. Then, the pyrex tube was flash frozen in a liquid N2 bath and degassed by freeze-pump-thaw technique for three times and sealed under vacuum. Upon warming to room temperature, the pyrex tube was placed in an oven and heated at 120°C for 72 h. The precipitate was collected by filtration, washed with DMF (8×5 mL), extracted by soxhlet extractor with tetrahydrofuran for 24 h, and finally dried at 120°C under vacuum for 12 h to obtain light yellow crystalline powder in 79% yield.

**Synthesis and characterizations of Pd@TB-COF**: The Pd@TB-COF was synthesized by solvothermal condensation reaction. A Pyrex tube was charged with TFBM (13.1 mg, 0.02 mmol), BATD (8.8 mg, 0.02 mmol), (Pd(acac)2) (6 mg, 8 mg, and 10 mg corresponds to Pd@TB-COF-6, Pd@TB-COF and Pd@TB-COF-10), o-DCB (1.8 mL), n-BuOH (0.2 mL) and 6 M aqueous acetic acid (0.2 mL). The mixture was sonicated for 30 min to get a homogeneous dispersion. Then, the pyrex tube was flash frozen in a liquid N2 bath and degassed by freeze-pump-thaw technique for three times and sealed under vacuum. Upon warming to room temperature, the pyrex tube was placed in an oven and heated at 120°C for 72 h. The precipitate was collected by filtration, washed with DMF (8×5 mL), extracted by soxhlet extractor with tetrahydrofuran for 24 h, and finally dried at 120°C under vacuum for 12 h to obtain brownish grey crystalline powder in 81% yield.

**Synthesis of Pd@NC**: Typically, 30 mg of the obtained brownish grey (Pd@TB-COF) was put into a magnetic boat and heated at 900°C for 2 h (the heating rate 5°C min <sup>1</sup> ) under N2 atmosphere to yield the Pd@NC (12.5 mg). The TB-COF-NC, Pd@NC-6, Pd@NC-10 were obtained through the similar method.

**Characterizations**: Infrared spectra were recorded on an ABB Bomem FTLA 2000–104 spectrometer with KBr pellets in the region of 600–4000 cm <sup>1</sup> . The Raman spectra were performed on a Renishaw inVia reflex Raman microscope under an excitation of 785 nm laser light with the power of 20 mW. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) data were collected on a Bruker D8 Venture diffractometer using the Cu Kα radiation source. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were carried out with an Thermo Scientific K-Alpha. The data of all samples were calibrated by C 1s to 284.8 eV. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), were taken on a Hitachi S-4800 SEM and FEI Talos F200S TEM respectively. The gas adsorptiondesorption measurements were carried out on a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 HD88 surface area and pore size analyzer. The surface area measurements were performed using an automatic volumetric adsorption equipment (Belsorpmax II) with N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms at liquid nitrogen temperature (77 K) after thermal dehydration under vacuum at 120°C for 12 h. The pore volumes were calculated by a single point method at *P/P0*=0.99 and the pore size distributions were derived from the adsorption branches of the isotherms using the non-localized density functional theory (NLDFT) method.

**Electrochemical measurements**: Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) was evaluated in a three-electrode system on a CHI 760E electrochemical workstation using a rotating disk electrode (RDE, ALS Co. Ltd). The area of the working electrode is 0.07 cm2 . An Ag/AgCl electrode and a graphite rod were used as the reference electrode and the counter electrode respectively. All the electrochemical measurements were taken in a O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH solution. The potential was converted according to the equation: ERHE=EAg/ AgCl+0.059 × pH+0.204. Polishing of the GC electrode with an aluminum oxide abrasive on a felt polishing pad, ultrasonically cleaned with ethanol, and deionized water before use. The ORR catalyst ink (5 mg, TB-COF-NC, Pd@NC-6, Pd@NC, Pd@NC-10,) were ultrasonic dispersed in a 0.5 mL of solution containing 0.49 mL of ethanol, and 10 μL of Nafion solution (5 wt %), followed the catalyst ink (10 μL) was pipetted on the glassy carbon electrode. The mass loading of the catalyst was 0.57 mgcm <sup>2</sup> . The RDE measurements for the ORR were conducted in O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH at a rotation rate of 1600 rpm at a scan rate of 10 mVs 1 . The final oxygen reduction currents were obtained by subtracting the background

currents measured in the N2-purged electrolyte from those measured in the O2-saturated electrolyte. The determination of electron transfer number (n) was similar to LSV measurement, besides the ring electrode was applied on a constant potential of 1.2 V vs. RHE. And the trans number (n) can be calculated using the below equations: n=4×iD/(iD+iR/N) where iD and iR is the current of disk electrode (mA) and ring electrode (mA), respectively. N is the collecting coefficient (0.424).

**Battery measurements**: Zn—air batteries were performed in a home-built electrochemical cell. Pd@NC catalyst coated on nickel foam (ca. 1.25 mg/cm2 ) was used as the air cathode. The polished commercial Zn foil with a thickness of 0.3 mm was used as the anode. 6 M KOH containing 0.2 M zinc acetate was used as electrolyte for rechargeable Zn-air batteries. The discharging profiles were obtained using CHI 760E electrochemical workstation at a current density of 10 mA/cm2 . The galvanostatic tests were collected at a current density of 10 mA/cm2 . For comparison, control batteries were made using 20% Pt/C as the cathode catalyst which was uniformly coated on the nickel foam substrates (ca. 1.25 mg/cm<sup>2</sup> ), which similar to the process of making the Pd@NC electrodes.

# High-dispersion Co/N/C ultra-thin carbon nanosheets modified with trace Ce as efficient oxygen reduction reaction catalysts†

Xiaogi Zhu, Shengnan Xie, Xin Fu, Sheng Zhu, Yulin Min, Qunjie Xu and Qiaoxia Li 🕩 \*

Efficient precious metal-free oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysts are key to reducing the cost of fuel cells and metal-air batteries. In this study, we synthesized Ce-Co-based N-doped porous carbon nanosheets (Ce-Co/N/C) by introducing a small amount of rare earth element Ce to improve the catalytic activity of Co-based electrocatalysts. Here, folic acid (FA) was used as a metal complex ligand, and Ce-Co/ N/C was synthesized using a solvothermal method with molten salt template-assisted calcination. The resulting Ce-Co/N/C material exhibited superior ORR performance in alkaline media with a high half-wave potential of 0.893 V (vs. RHE), splendid stability and methanol resistance, which are significantly better than those of commercial 20% Pt/C. These favorable chemical properties are due to their advantageous composition and structure. Transmission electron microscopy and N2 adsorption-desorption experiments showed that the catalyst has a large specific surface area and a hierarchical pore structure. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed that the change in Co binding energy after Ce doping indicates the adjustment of the Co electronic structure, which optimizes the adsorption/desorption of oxygen-containing intermediates and greatly improves the catalytic activity for oxygen reduction.

# 1. Introduction

Advanced energy conversion and storage systems are gaining much attention for their significant role in clean energy technologies. Among the new sustainable energy technologies available, fuel cells are considered to be the most suitable energy carriers and one of the energy conversion technologies.<sup>2,3</sup> It was found that the speed of cathodic oxygen reduction has a significant influence on the efficiency (ORR) of fuel cells.<sup>4</sup> Therefore, improving the slow reaction kinetics in the ORR process can help enhance the cell efficiency of fuel cells. The use of appropriate catalysts is the main means to improve this process.<sup>5</sup> Precious metals are mainly used as fuel cell catalysts; however, this has increased the cost of fuel cells dramatically.4 In order to further the use and development of fuel cells on a broad scale, nonprecious metal ORR catalyst research and development have become a top research priority in the field.

Recently, many researchers have been focusing on developing high-efficiency, durable, and low-cost transition metal M-N-C

(Fe<sup>6</sup>, Co<sup>7</sup>, and Mn<sup>8</sup>) catalysts. As a substitute for noble metalbased electrocatalysts, transition metal Fe-N-C has become a promising and competitive candidate because of its high conductivity and activity.9 However, there are many challenges in material preparation due to the high specific surface free energy of the Fe catalyst and its easy migration and agglomeration. Replacing Fe-based catalysts with Co-based catalysts 10 can overcome these problems. Compared to Fe-based catalysts, the activity of Co-based catalysts must be improved further. Structural control and catalyst surface engineering are considered to be the most effective tactics. 11 The total reaction rate in a catalytic process depends on the mass transfer of reaction intermediates and products and the transfer of electrons on the catalyst surface. 12 Different carbon topologies, particularly two-dimensional carbon nanosheets, have a significant amount of specific surface areas, exposing more effective catalytic reactive centers for the associated catalytic reaction. More than that, the layered structure of twodimensional carbon nanosheetscan serve as a transport route for reactants and intermediaries, which is advantageous for catalytic processes.<sup>13</sup> In addition, to prepare high activity catalysts, it is necessary to fundamentally improve the intrinsic activity of active sites. By adjusting the surface coordination environment of a catalyst, the corresponding electronic structure can be adjusted and the adsorption/desorption process of the reaction intermediate can be optimized, which is the key to determining the activity

of the catalyst. 14-16 In the past few decades, a great number of catalyst electronic structure modulation strategies have been reported, such as heteroatom doping, defect engineering, and surface and interface engineering, which can effectively enhance the electrocatalytic performance of catalysts. 12 For cobalt-based catalysts, due to the differences in physical properties such as ionic radius, valence and electronegativity between Co atoms and doping atoms, doping will lead to structural distortions and material defects in the catalyst, which can improve the inherent activity and structure of catalytically active substances. The coupling of doping elements and matrix materials can improve the interfacial properties of the catalyst, create more active sites and further improve the electrocatalytic efficiency.

China is the world's largest producer of rare earth elements, and its reserves and output rank first in the world. Rare earth elements have recently received particular attention for their ability to adjust electronic structures and improve the catalytic performance of various transition metal-based materials due to their distinct 4f subshell electrons and chemical characteristics. 17,18 Ce is a common rare earth material, and is mainly used in the field of catalytic materials, and the localized electrons in the 4f orbital can be stored and transported, and small molecules such as O2 can be adsorbed. Its common valence states are (III) and (IV), and it can be reversibly transformed between Ce(III) and Ce(IV). 19 When the doped Ce is coupled with other components, it shows a strong synergistic effect. In addition, the introduction of Ce also increases the stability and corrosion resistance of non-noble metal electrocatalytic materials during electrochemical testing.20 Therefore, the doping of rare earth element Ce is widely used in the field of electrochemistry. 21,22 Huang et al. prepared a rare earth Ce-doped NiFe layered double hydroxide (Ce-Ni-Fe-LDH) using a one-step method.<sup>23</sup> Thanks to the oxygen affinity and synergistic coordination of the decoration, the prepared Ce-Ni-Fe-LDH showed excellent catalytic activity for the alkaline OER. Besides, DFT theoretical calculations showed that the doping of rare earth Ce was helpful in stabilizing the initial morphology of the catalyst, optimizing the electronic structure of NiFe-LDH and adjusting the oxygencontaining intermediate on the catalyst surface. In addition, numerous studies have demonstrated that reactive oxygen species (ROS) derived from peroxides, as opposed to an H2O2 molecule, are responsible for the degradation of M-N-C catalysts.<sup>24</sup> However, Gubler et al. discovered that the Nafion polymer membranes can be shielded from hydroxyl radical degradation by a Ce3+/Ce4+ redox pair.25 In response to this, we considered doping a small quantity of Ce into Co to modify the surface electron distribution of the catalyst and boost its catalytic activity.

Folic acid (FA) can be carbonized at low temperature, with large supply and no pollution.<sup>26</sup> It is composed of a pteridine ring, p-aminobenzoic acid, and L-glutamic acid. It has a very high content of N elements and a large number of -COOH, -NH<sub>2</sub>, and -OH functional groups, which can coordinate with metal ions. The existence of metal complex ligand functional groups is very important for anchoring and improving the chemical stability of catalysts.

In this work, we propose a simple complexation strategy, using folic acid with a large number of -COOH and -NH2 groups to anchor metal ions. The NaCl template method is safe and easy to remove, which can increase the specific area of the catalyst and facilitate the formation of interconnected porous structures. Meanwhile, we used a low content of Ce<sup>3+</sup> promoter to modify the electronic state of the Co-based catalyst surface and to increase the intrinsic activity of the Co-based catalyst. Finally, N-doped carbon nanosheets Ce-Co/N/C were successfully synthesized and showed outstanding ORR activity. long-term durability, and great resistance to methanol toxicity.

# 2. Experimental section

#### 2.1. Materials synthesis

Synthesis of the Ce-Co-FA precursor. The synthesis method was as follows: under continuous agitation, 1 mmol of FA was put in a round-bottom flask filled with 30 mL ultra-pure water. The above solution was made neutral with 0.1 M NaOH. Subsequently, 0.95 mmol of CoCl<sub>2</sub>·6H<sub>2</sub>O and 0.05 mmol of Ce(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>·4H<sub>2</sub>O were then added to the solution. When the solution became uniform, the round-bottom flask was placed in an oil bath heating device and reacted at 60 °C for 30 min. The samples were centrifuged at a speed of 5000 rpm after they were cooled to room temperature, washed three or four times with anhydrous methanol, and dried for 10 hours in a vacuum drying oven at 65 °C.

Synthesis of Ce-Co/N/C. Typically, NaCl particles and Ce-Co-FA precursor were mixed at a mass ratio of 1:20 and then milled until the mixture was homogenized and then placed in a quartz boat. Next, the precursor was calcined with argon gas at 800 °C for 1 hour to obtain the sample. The sample was washed with plenty of ultrapure water to remove NaCl particles. After that, the sample was dried for 8 hours. The excess and disordered Co clusters were washed away by stirring with a 2 M HCl solution at 40 °C for 10 hours. The sample was neutralized with ultra-pure water and dried overnight in a 65 °C vacuum drying oven. The dried powder was placed in a tubular furnace filled with argon gas for secondary annealing at 800 °C. Ce-Co/N/C was obtained as the final catalyst. The same process was used to synthesize Co/N/C, N/C and Ce-Co/N/C-no NaCl.

#### 2.2. Material characterization

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM, model: JEM-2100F) was used to analyze the internal structure, thickness, and whether there were nanoparticles in the sample.<sup>27</sup> Solid X-ray diffraction (XRD, model: X' Pert PRO MPD) spectra were used to determine whether the sample was amorphous or crystalline, and at the same time, the phase composition of the analysis sample was determined by comparing with the standard card.<sup>28</sup> X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, model: ESCALAB250) was used to analyze the surface chemical composition of the final catalyst, and the valence state information of each component.29

#### 2.3. Test method for electrochemical properties of catalysts

Electrochemical testing was mainly carried out through the traditional three-electrode system. First of all, for the reference NJC Paper

electrode, to accurately grasp the potential of the working electrode, there must be an electrode that keeps the potential constant during the test as a reference. In this experiment, Ag/AgCl electrode was selected as the reference electrode. A stable graphite rod was used as the counter electrode; the function of the counter electrode was to form a loop, which can let the current pass through the whole test process. Finally, for the working electrode, a glassy carbon disc electrode and a glass-carbon disk platinum ring electrode from the American PINE Company were used as a substrate to test the catalyst performance, and the prepared catalyst slurry was drop-coated on this substrate to prepare the working electrode. The specific preparation method was as follows: preparation of the working electrode: (1) 3 mg of catalyst was weighed and added to a 2 mL sample tube, followed by the addition of 350 µL of ultrapure water, 150  $\mu L$  of ethanol and 25  $\mu L$  of Nafion solution, and the sample tube was shaken in ultrasound for at least 30 minutes to form catalyst ink (catalyst concentration 6 mg  $mL^{-1}$ ); and then (2) a pipette gun was used to drop the catalyst ink onto the polished electrode sequentially 10  $\mu L \times 2$  times. The loading of target catalysts was 0.58 mg cm<sup>-2</sup> (note: the loading capacity of the Pt/C catalyst used in this experiment was 0.02 mg cm<sup>-2</sup>). After drying the electrode surface (generally within 60 minutes), the electrochemical activity was tested.

Oxygen reduction performance test: linear scanning voltammetry and cyclic voltammetry are important means to effectively identify whether the catalyst has oxygen reduction activity. The samples were tested in 0.1 M KOH solution saturated with O2, and the measured voltages were converted to the RHE scale. The cyclic voltammetry curve of the catalyst was recorded at a scanning speed of 50 mV s<sup>-1</sup> in the voltage range of 0.2 to 1.1 V (vs. RHE). After CV activation, LSV was

performed. The determination of the electron transfer number was carried out by using a ring electrode; the ring voltage was set to 0.5 V (vs. RHE) and the ORR polarization curves of the ring and the disk were obtained, and the corresponding electron transfer number and peroxide yield were obtained from formulas (1) and (2).30

#### Results and discussion

As seen in Fig. 1, using folic acid molecules containing more coordination sites to chelate metal ions, Co<sup>2+</sup> and Ce<sup>2+</sup> were successfully introduced to form Ce-Co/N/C with a twodimensional sheet structure by a simple hydrothermal method and an NaCl template method. The resulting catalyst was characterized by the following tests.

First, the microscopic morphology of Ce-Co/N/C/and Co/N/C/ catalysts was characterized, and the TEM images are shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. S1 (ESI†), respectively. As shown in Fig. 2a, the Ce-Co/N/C sample presents an ultrathin nanosheet structure with a complete and uniform morphology. Also, there are many obvious pore structures on the nanosheets (Fig. 2b). The Ce-Co/

N/C sample has a thin and complete layered structure with a large specific surface area and porous structure, which provides a favorable structural basis for the oxygen reduction process.31,32 The HRTEM images (Fig. 2c) show some graphite layers with a lattice spacing of 0.336 nm, corresponding to the (002) crystal plane of graphitic carbon (sp<sup>2</sup> carbon).<sup>33</sup> Graphitic carbon can improve the conductivity of the catalyst.<sup>34</sup> The carbon structure at the edge of Fig. 2c shows a turbine-like curved shape, which may promote nitrogen doping into the graphite structure, thereby increasing the number of active sites.<sup>35</sup> Meanwhile, the selected area electron diffractogram (SAED) of the Ce-Co/N/C sample exhibited two diffuse diffraction rings and no obvious pattern spots (Fig. 2d), demonstrating that the Ce-Co/N/C catalyst is a typical amorphous material. And no metal particles and associated metal lattice stripes were observed in the TEM image. Energy spectral dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) (Fig. 2e) showed that N, Ce, and Co were uniformly distributed across the carbon matrix. This can be attributed to the efficient coordination of folic acid with Co<sup>2+</sup> and Ce<sup>2+</sup>.

To explore the structure of composite Ce-Co/N/C, the product was investigated by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD). As shown in Fig. 3a, the XRD maps of both Ce-Co/N/C and Co/N/C samples exhibited a wide obvious diffraction peak at 26.5°, corresponding to the crystal plane of graphitized carbon (002), indicating that the sample had a high degree of graphitization. Meanwhile, a high degree of graphitization represented good electrical conductivity.<sup>36</sup> It is worth noting that there was no detectable peaks corresponding to cobalt, cobalt oxide, or cerium oxide in the spectrum. The results showed that Co and Ce did not form stable crystalline compounds. 30,37

The degree of graphitization and disorder of the catalysts were further determined by Raman spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. 3b, the two peaks at 1595 cm<sup>-1</sup> (G peak) and 1352 cm<sup>-1</sup> (D peak) can be attributed to vibration and structural defects of sp<sup>2</sup> hybrid carbon atoms, such as disorder, holes, and edge defects.<sup>30</sup> A high D-peak-to-G-peak ratio  $(I_D/I_G)$  represented a decrease in graphitization, an increase in disorder, and an

increase in defective structures.30 The catalysts N/C, Co/N/C, and Ce-Co/N/C showed intensity ratios of 1.29, 1.29, and 1.31, respectively.<sup>38</sup> The results showed that the addition of Ce increased the disorder degree of the Ce-Co/N/C catalyst and decreased the degree of graphitization. And no obvious characteristic peaks of metals Ce and Co were observed in the Raman spectrum.

Utilizing nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms, the pore structures of all catalysts were identified. As shown in Fig. 3c, Ce-Co/N/C and Co/N/C catalysts displayed typical type IV isotherms and prominent H3-type hysteresis loops, revealing the presence of mesoporous structures. 39,40 In particular, in these catalysts, the hysteresis loop increased smoothly with an increase in  $P/P_0$ , which was generally considered to be a characteristic of a sheet-like structure. 41 These sheet-like structures can also be seen in the TEM images (Fig. 2). Co/N/C and Ce-Co/N/C both embodied numerous mesopores and micropores, and additionally quite a few macropores (Fig. 3d). The BET surface areas of the above three samples are summarized in Table S1 (ESI†). Compared with Co/N/C, the specific surface area of the Ce-Co/N/C catalyst was significantly increased to 442.47 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>, while the specific surface area of the Co/N/C catalyst was only 342.55 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>. Therefore, it is clear that the addition of Ce produced a porous catalyst with a high specific surface area. The reason may be that Ce doping caused more defects on carbon nanosheets, thus increasing the specific surface area of Ce-Co/N/C. The result is consistent with the Raman results. Also, NaCl as a template increases the surface area of the Ce-Co/N/C catalyst and promotes the formation of interconnected porous structures (Table S1, ESI†). In the ORR process, a porous structure and a large specific surface area can really increase the exposure probability of active sites, and also support the transport of ions or electrons, thus improving the catalytic activity.42

To study the elemental valence state and structure of the prepared samples, XPS analysis was conducted on the samples. Fig. 4a shows the XPS full spectrum analysis of Ce-Co/N/C. The

full spectrum analysis of Ce-Co/N/C definitely corroborates the existence of Ce, Co, C, N, and O. Fig. 4c shows the high resolution Co 2p XPS curve of the Ce-Co/N/C catalyst. The Co 2p XPS spectra shows two peaks at 780.0 eV and 795.2 eV, proving the presence of Co3+ species. The peaks at 781.9 eV and 797.0 eV were attributed to  $\mathrm{Co^{2+}}$ , indicating that  $\mathrm{Co^{3+}}$  and  $\mathrm{Co^{2+}}$  coexisted in the Ce-Co/N/C samples.43 In the Ce 3d spectrum, the binding energies of the Ce  $3d_{5/2}$  and Ce  $3d_{3/2}$  regions (Fig. 4d) were 878-893 eV and 896-915 eV, respectively, which verified the coexistence of Ce<sup>4+</sup> and Ce<sup>3+</sup>. In addition, the constant conversion between Ce(III) and Ce(IV) also provided an advantage for the rapid transfer of charge.<sup>22</sup> In the C 1s spectrum(Fig. S3, ESI†), three peaks at 284.6, 285.6, and 287.3 eV were attributed to C-C, C-O/C-N, and C=O-C, respectively. 45 The peak at about 531 eV in the survey XPS spectrum may be attributed to the oxidation on the sample surface and the introduction of physically adsorbed O and chemically adsorbed O species. 46 The high-resolution XPS spectrum of N 1S can be deconvoluted into five peaks of 398.1, 398.9, 400.2, 401.1 and 403.6 eV, corresponding to pyridine N, Co coordinating nitrogen (Co-N), pyrrole N, graphite N and nitrogen oxide, respectively. 40,47-49 The elemental content of all samples obtained by XPS is summarized in Table S2 (ESI†), and the data showed that the nitrogen doping content of Ce-Co/N/C samples increased to 11.1%, obviously higher than that of Co/N/C catalysts (6.36%). It is shown that the addition of Ce can promote nitrogen doping. Besides the total content of N doping, the bonding type of N doping also influences the activity of the catalysts.50

To analyze the influence of different N atom types on ORR catalytic activity, the content of different types of nitrogen in the Ce-Co/N/C and Co/N/C catalysts was compared. As can be seen from Table S3 (ESI†), graphite-N (38.83%) and pyridine-N (26.49%) occupied the dominant proportion of the N conformation. The high content of pyridine-N and graphite-N imparts greater positive charge density to the adjoining carbon atoms, which is conducive to the adsorption of oxygen on the catalyst surface and the breaking of O-O bonds during the ORR process, thus accelerating the oxygen reduction rate. 51-53 The Co-N chemical bond is regarded as one of the most efficient active sites in electrocatalytic reaction. 54-56 As shown in Table S3 (ESI†), Ce-Co/N/C has a larger Co-N bond content (18.16%) than Co/N/C (11.94%). The results indicated that there were more Co-N active sites in Ce-Co/N/C which affected the reaction rate.

Fig. 5 shows the change in Co 2p binding energy in Ce-Co/N/C and Co/N/C. The Co 2p of Ce-Co/N/C moved approximately 0.2 eV towards low binding energy compared to Co/N/C samples, which shows that electrons were transferred to Co-Nx bits, 57,58 increasing the electron density around Co-Nx. The increased density of electrons on Co, possibly due to a significant difference in electronegativity between Ce and Co (1.12 vs. 1.88),58 prompted the transfer of electrons from Ce to Co. The shift in the Co 2p binding energy provides evidence that Ce doping can adjust the electronic structure of cobalt, leading to the surface charge redistribution of reactants, and enhancing the charge transfer kinetics of the Ce-Co/N/C catalyst. The increase in electron cloud

density of Co may also modulate the d-band center of Co to a suitable position, resulting in optimization of the adsorption/ desorption of oxygen-containing intermediates and greatly improving the catalytic activity of oxygen reduction.<sup>59,60</sup>

#### 3.1. Electrochemical performance

Compared with Co/N/C, Ce-Co/N/C, and commercial Pt/C catalysts, the electrocatalytic performance of Ce-Co/N/C was assessed on a rotating disk electrode. First, cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were conducted to determine the cathodic peak of Ce-Co/N/C in an O2 saturated 0.1M KOH electrolyte, which was found to be 0.87 V, showing that Ce-Co/N/C had greater ORR electrocatalytic activity (Fig. 6a). The ORR activity sequence of the catalysts is as follows: Co/N/C < Pt/C < Ce-Co/ N/C, as evident from an initial potential ( $E_{\text{onset}}$ ) of 1.015 V, a half-wave potential  $(E_{1/2})$  of 0.893 V and a limiting current density (J<sub>L</sub>) of 5.29 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> for Ce-Co/N/C, which were more positive than those of Co/N/C ( $E_{\text{onset}}$ : 1.002 V,  $E_{1/2}$ : 0.857 V, and  $J_{\rm L}$ : 4.56 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>) and even more positive than those of Pt/C  $(E_{\text{onset}}: 0.988 \text{ V}, E_{1/2}: 0.860 \text{ V}, \text{ and } J_{\text{L}}: 5.35 \text{ mA cm}^{-2})$  (Fig. 6b and c). It can be concluded that the ORR performance of the Co/N/C catalyst can be effectively improved through the successful doping of Ce<sup>3+</sup> promoters. Impressively, the half-wave potential of the Ce-Co/N/C catalyst is also much higher than that of most

The magnitude was 0.5 V, and the working electrode had been polarized

other non-precious metal catalysts reported in the literature so far (Table S5, ESI†). To further prove the excellent performance of the Ce-Co/N/C catalyst, we tested the performance of the Ce-Co/N/C catalyst under acidic conditions of 0.1 M HClO<sub>4</sub> (Fig. S4, ESI†).

To further compare the electrochemical properties of Ce-Co/ N/C, Co/N/C and commercial JM 20% Pt/C, their impedance spectra were measured (Fig. 6d). Impedance data were simulated using equivalent circuit diagrams. In the equivalent circuit diagram,  $R_s$  is the electrolyte resistance.  $R_{ct}$  represents the resistance of electron transmission between the electrode surface and the adsorbed substance on the electrode surface, which can be used to evaluate the activity of the catalyst in the electrode. 61,62 W<sub>1</sub> is the Warburg impedance, which is a concentration impedance caused by the transmission of the substance to the electrode, and represents the diffusion process.<sup>63</sup> The semicircle in the high frequency range is controlled by the electrode reaction kinetics (charge transfer process), and the inclined line in the low frequency range is controlled by the diffusion of reactants or products in the electrode reaction. Rct values of Ce-Co/N/C, Co/N/C and Pt/C are 38.74  $\Omega$ , 41.86  $\Omega$ , and 45.28  $\Omega$ , respectively (Table S5, ESI†). Ce-Co/N/C has lower  $R_{ct}$  compared with Co/N/C, demonstrating that Ce doping can accelerate the electron transfer. Besides, the charge transfer or redistribution induced can also reduce the energy barrier of ORR by weakening the O-O bond energy, thus favoring the ORR.64

Fig. 7a shows the Ce-Co/N/C catalyst in O2 saturated 0.1 M KOH solution with a scanning speed of 5 mV s<sup>-1</sup> at different rotating speeds. In this paper, the ORR dynamics of Ce-Co/N/C are studied by testing current-potential curves at different speeds. The computed electron transfer number (n) of Ce-Co/ N/C is around 3.79 according to the Koutecky-Levich equation (Fig. 7b and c), demonstrating that the ORR process is dominated by four-electron states. Moreover, in Fig. S5 (ESI†), the test results of the rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) show that the average electron transfer number of the Ce-Co/N/C catalyst is 3.67 (Fig. S5b, ESI†), which is basically consistent with the transfer number determined from the K-L equation. The yield of hydrogen peroxide using the Ce-Co/N/C catalyst was also **Paper**

very low. Fig. S5(a) (ESI†) shows that the average yields of hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) with Ce-Co/N/C, Co-N/C, N/C and JM 20% Pt/C catalysts were 16.82%, 40.68%, 51.77% and 8.7%, respectively. It shows that the Ce-Co/N/C catalyst follows a fourelectron transfer process in the process of catalyzing oxygen. Fig. 7d displays the Tafel slope that was determined using the polarization curve. Co/N/C, Ce-Co/N/C and JM 20% Pt/C have Tafel slopes of 81.3, 69.5 and 81.4 mV  $dec^{-1}$ , respectively. The experimental findings indicate that Ce-Co/N/C shows a faster reaction kinetics, the fastest electron transfer, and a more complete reaction. This is compatible with impedance results.

As depicted in Fig. 8a, after 10 000 cycles of continuous operation, only a very slight activity decline was seen in an alkaline electrolyte, with a loss of only 6 mV of half-wave potential, while the commercial JM 20% Pt/C with 10 000 cycles of continuous operation under the same conditions (Fig. 8b) showed a significant decay of activity, with a decline of 23 mV in half-wave potential. It was further proved that Ce-Co/N/C material is quite a good catalyst for efficient and stable use in proton exchange membrane fuel cells. Fig. 8c shows that the timing current of the Ce-Co/N/C catalyst decreases by 25.26% after 50 000 s, while the ORR current density of the commercial

JM 20% Pt/C decreases by 55.33% after 50000 s, increasingly demonstrating that the Ce-Co/N/C catalyst has excellent electrochemical stability. The methanol tolerance of Ce-Co/N/C was further evaluated by injecting a methanol solution into the electrolyte. As shown in Fig. 8d, the current density of Pt/C dropped sharply when methanol was injected. Instead, for Pt/C catalysts, the current density fluctuated only slightly after the introduction of methanol, reflecting its excellent anti-methanol properties. 65,66

Combined with the above experimental results, the outstanding ORR catalytic activity of the Ce-Co/N/C catalyst can be attributed to the following factors. First, with the help of a sodium chloride template, Ce-Co/N/C forms a suitable pore structure with a large specific surface area. Second, the existence of Ce gives Ce-Co/N/C a higher defect degree and a higher percentage of total nitrogen content of graphite-N, Co-N and pyridine-N species, which makes the catalytic activity of ORR better. Finally, charge transfer occurs between Ce and Co, leading to a shift in Co 2p binding energy, which reflects a change in the electron cloud density of Co 2p, adjusting the adsorption strength of the ORR intermediate, which is favorable for the enhancement of catalytic performance of Ce-Co/N/C.

Fig. 8 LSV curve of the O<sub>2</sub> saturated 0.1 mol L<sup>-1</sup> KOH solution at the beginning and after 10 000 cycles with 1600 rpm: (a) Ce-Co/N/C catalyst and (b) JM 20% Pt/C. (c) Amperometric i-t curves and. The potential used for the chronoamperometry test was the half-wave potential and (d) methanol tolerance of Ce-Co/N/C and JM 20% Pt/C in O<sub>2</sub> saturated 0.1 mol L<sup>-1</sup> KOH at 1600 rpm.

### 4. Conclusions

In conclusion, Ce-Co/N/C electrocatalysts were successfully prepared for fuel cell cathodic oxygen reduction by pyrolysis of the Ce-CoFA precursor assisted by a molten salt template, followed by removal of the template by acid etching of freely or loosely bound Co nanoparticles. The synthesized catalyst exhibited a thin twodimensional porous carbon nanosheet structure. Experimental studies showed that doping Ce<sup>3+</sup> into Co/N/C can significantly improve its catalytic activity and stability, and its performance and stability are better than those of commercial JM 20% Pt/C catalysts. Therefore, it will become possible in the future to replace precious metal catalysts for fuel cells with doped catalysts containing rare-earth elements.

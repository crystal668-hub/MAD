#### Abstract

The research on low-cost, high-performance non platinum group metal (PGM) oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts is of great significance for the rapid promotion of fuel cells' practical applications. In this work, Mn–N–C catalyst with outstanding activity was prepared through using hydrogel formed by coordination of sodium alginate (SA) and Mn2<sup>+</sup> as the precursor. During the preparation process, g-C3N4 was added to improve the surface area enrich the pore structure of catalysts, as well as to function as the nitrogen source. Compare with commercial Pt/ C catalyst, the optimum Mn–N–C catalyst possesses extraordinary ORR activity in alkaline electrolytes, with a half-wave potential (E1/2) of 0.90 V. In addition, the Mn–N–C catalyst also displays exceptional stability in alkaline and acidic electrolytes, much superior to Pt/C catalyst.

# 1. Introduction

Climate change has been a common problem that mankind needs to face since several decades ago. The rapid growth of greenhouse gas from human activity, mainly carbon dioxide, has caused a great threat to the living system. In this context, countries all over the world have proposed to cut down CO2 emissions and endeavor to reach the goal of 'carbon neutrality' [[1](#page-8-0)] in the middle of this century. In addition, due to the ever-increasing consumption in industrialized human society, traditional fossil energy sources are also in danger of running short. Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) [[2](#page-8-0)–[4](#page-8-0)] and Zn-air batteries [[5,](#page-8-0) [6](#page-8-0)] are among the solution to achieving 'carbon neutrality' and reducing fossil energy consumption. However, the dynamics of cathodic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) of these energy conversion devices is extremely sluggish, requiring ORR catalysts with excellent performances [[7](#page-8-0)]. The commonly used Pt/C catalysts have the drawbacks of exorbitant price and low stability. Consequently, developing platinum group metal (PGM)-free ORR catalysts with superb performance, inexpensive price and excellent stability is highly significant [[8,](#page-8-0) [9](#page-8-0)].

Until now, the PGM-free ORR catalysts that have been widely researched are transitional metal and N co-doped carbon M–N–C (M = Fe, Co, Mn). Although Fe-based [[10](#page-8-0)] and Co-based [[11](#page-8-0)] ORR catalysts have high activity, they either suffer from poor stability due to the Fenton reaction occurring during the ORR process or high price owing to the low

abundance of cobalt element. The Mn-based catalyst thus appears to be more promising as inexpensive and highly active ORR catalysts. However, the synthesis of Mn-N-C catalyst synthesis is rather challenging, because Mn atoms can easily agglomerate to form manganese oxides during pyrolysis, resulting in reduced ORR activity [12]. Therefore, finding a suitable precursor that can effectively disperse Mn atoms is one of the solutions [13]. Sodium alginate (SA), a crude polysaccharide mainly composed of the sodium salt of alginic acid [14], is the organic compound that meets this requirement. The alginic acid copolymer composed of a-L-mannuronic acid (M-block) and b-D-guluronic acid (G-block) [15, 16], can chelate with divalent or trivalent transition metal ions (Mn<sup>2+</sup>, Co<sup>2+</sup> and Fe<sup>3+</sup>) to form hydrogels [17]. When metal ions are coordinated with the G-blocks of the alginate, the 'egg-box' structure is formed and metal ions are evenly distributed in the hydrogel matrix, which can effectively reduce metal ions agglomeration amid high-temperature pyrolysis, thereby improving the stability of the catalyst material [18, 19].

In recent years, experimental studies using SA as the precursor have been sporadically reported. Zhang *et al* used SA as the precursor and added Zn/Co ions to coordinate with the four G-blocks to form 'egg-box' structures. The 'egg-box' structure was the key to the controllable synthesis of highly dispersed atomic metals [20]. Hao *et al* used ammonia water to dissolve SA, followed by hydrothermal and high-temperature pyrolysis to generate an N-doped bio-carbon electrocatalyst with ORR performance [21]. These experimental studies show that SA is a precursor that can be used to prepare ORR catalysts and has a good development prospect. Considering the tendency to agglomeration of Mn element under high temperature treatment, it appears promising to use the egg-box structure to alleviate this problem, however, it has never been reported in this regard.

In this study, we synthesized hydrogels as the precursor for preparing an Mn-based catalyst from the chelating G-block of SA with  $\mathrm{Mn^{2+}}$ . Meanwhile, a certain amount of  $\mathrm{g\text{-}C_3N_4}$  was added to increase material specific surface area and to provide nitrogen sources. Ball milling was used to make  $\mathrm{Mn^{2+}}$  more easily dispersed in hydrogel and reduce the

possibility of manganese oxide formation during pyrolysis. After freeze-drying and pyrolysis of the hydrogel, the surface area of the prepared Mn–N-C-(SA+g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>)-950 catalyst was extremely high, reaching 1378 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>. In the electrochemistry study, the catalyst displayed excellent ORR performance in alkaline electrolytes, and its half-wave potential  $(E_{1/2})$  was 0.90 V. At the same time, after the 10 000 potential cycles, it demonstrated an exceptional stability, and the reduction of  $E_{1/2}$  was only 8 mV, while the decrease in  $E_{1/2}$  of Pt/C catalyst was 42 mV. In addition, the catalyst also showed superior ORR performance and stability in acidic electrolytes compared to other manganese based catalysts. This work provides ideas for the design and preparation of precursors of high-performance Mn–N–C ORR catalysts.

According to previous literature, the carbon nitride g- $C_3N_4$  was synthesized[22]. In detail, 1 g of melamine and 1 g of cyanuric acid were dissolved in 80 ml of ethanol, stirred and sonicated for 3 h. Then, the mixed solution was centrifuged and dried to obtain a white powder sample, pyrolyzed in a furnace at 550 °C for 6 h, and after natural cooling, a yellow porous sample was obtained, namely g- $C_3N_4$ .

dispersed in 310 ml of H2O to obtain solution A. 1.56 g of MnCl2 was dispersed in 10 ml of H2O to obtain solution B. Afterwards, solution B was added to solution A dropwise. The mixed solution was stirred continuously for 3 h, after which 1 ml cyanamide was dropped to it. Then 0.3 g of g-C3N4 was added to the mixed solution with ball milling for 6 h. The above mixed solution was freeze-dried. Afterwards, the lyophilized sample was pyrolyzed under N2 atmosphere at 950 °C for 1 h. The pyrolyzed sample was pickled and dried, and then pyrolyzed again at 950 °C for 3 h in N2 atmosphere to acquire the ultimate catalyst, named Mn–N–C-(SA+g-C3N4)-950. As a contrast, Mn–N–C-(SA)-950 catalyst was made following the identical experimental procedure, but without g-C3N4 addition. For the purpose of exploring the pyrolysis temperature impact, catalysts were made by pyrolysis at 900 °C and 1000 °C and named as Mn–N–C-(SA+g-C3N4)-900 and Mn–N–C-(SA+g-C3N4)-1000 catalysts, respectively.

# 3. Results and discussion

SEM and TEM images showed the microscopic morphology of Mn–N–C-(SA+g-C3N4)-950 catalyst (figures 2(a), (b), S1 and S2 (available online at [stacks.iop.org](http://stacks.iop.org/NANO/33/245701/mmedia)/NANO/33/ 245701/[mmedia](http://stacks.iop.org/NANO/33/245701/mmedia))). The Mn–N–C-(SA+g-C3N4)-950 catalyst had a relatively dense porous structure, and its pore sizes were hierarchical. These pores were mainly caused by the evaporation of water during freeze-drying, the addition of g-C3N4 [[23](#page-9-0)] and the pyrolysis process. This porous structure provided a high surface area and also accelerated mass transport, thereby improving kinetic performance of the electrocatalytic process [[24](#page-9-0), [25](#page-9-0)]. In figure 2(c), the Mn–N–C- (SA+g-C3N4)-950 catalyst represented the properties of an amorphous carbon material. The HAADF-STEM image of

Mn–N–C-(SA+g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>)-950 catalyst and corresponding elemental mapping images were displayed in figures 2(d)–(h). Metal particles formed by Mn aggregation were not detected in figure 2(d). And Mn, N, C, O elements were evenly dispersed in the porous sample (figures 2(e)–(h)).

The XRD patterns of Mn–N–C-(SA+g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>)-950 catalyst and other reference catalysts were shown in figure 3(a). The XRD pattern of Mn-N-C-(SA+g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>)-950 catalyst showed two wide peaks at 24° and 43°, ascribing to the (002) and (101) peaks of amorphous carbon. [26] No peaks of other manganese compounds were observed, indicating that no large Mn particles were formed during pyrolysis. No manganese oxide peaks were seen on the XRD patterns of Mn–N–C-( $SA+g-C_3N_4$ )-950, Mn-N-C-(SA)-950, and  $Mn-N-C-(SA+g-C_3N_4)-900$  catalysts. However, the diffraction peak of Mn<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> was observed in a curve of figure 3(a) for Mn-N-C-(SA+g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>)-1000 catalyst, indicating that manganese oxide was formed during the pyrolysis process at 1000 °C. The results clearly demonstrated that pyrolysis temperature was critical to the formation of manganese oxide, lowering the temperature can relieve the formation of manganese oxide particles.

The structural defects and graphitization degree of the catalysts were studied through the Raman tests (figure 3(b)) [27, 28]. The D band (1300 cm<sup>-1</sup>) and G band (1580 cm<sup>-1</sup>) of carbon material represented lattice defects of C atoms and inplane stretching oscillation of the sp<sup>2</sup> hybridization of C atoms [29]. Through calculation, the intensity ratio of D band and G band ( $I_D/I_G$ ) was used to assess material structural defects degree and graphitization degree [30]. According to figure 3(b), the  $I_D/I_G$  ratio 1.05 of Mn–N–C-(SA+g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>)-950 catalyst was lower than 1.07 for Mn–N–C-(SA)-950 catalyst. This result showed that the addition of g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> reduced defects degree of catalyst, increased graphitization degree, and was advantageous to heighten conductivity of catalyst. Besides, the  $I_D/I_G$  ratios of

Mn–N–C-( $SA+g-C_3N_4$ )-900, Mn–N–C-( $SA+g-C_3N_4$ )-950 and Mn–N–C-( $SA+g-C_3N_4$ )-1000 catalysts were 1.09, 1.05 and 0.87, indicating that the graphitization degree of the sample increased with pyrolysis temperature.

The pore structure and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of materials were measured and analyzed through N<sub>2</sub> adsorption–desorption method, and the test results were shown in figures 3(c), (d) [31]. The surface area of Mn-N-C-(SA+g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>)-950 catalyst was 1378  $\text{m}^2\text{g}^{-1}$ , which was higher than that of Mn-N-C-(SA)-950 catalyst. Judging from the data in figure S3, compared with Mn-N-C-(SA)-950 catalyst, after adding g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>, the micropore area and mesopore area of Mn-N-C-(SA+g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>)-950 catalyst obviously increased. The surface area  $Mn-N-C-(SA+g-C_3N_4)-900$ ,  $Mn-N-C-(SA+g-C_3N_4)-950$ and Mn-N-C-(SA+g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>)-1000 catalysts decreased gradually, indicating that the pyrolysis temperature had a considerable impact on the specific surface area of materials. Among all these catalysts, Mn-N-C-(SA+g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>)-1000 catalyst had the lowest specific surface area of 953 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>. Moreover, the calculated micropore surface area of the catalyst was only 485 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>, quite different from the other two temperature catalysts. This result was also consistent with its XRD spectrum that during the pyrolysis process at 1000 °C, a significant amount of Mn<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> particles were formed and may block the pores of the Mn–N–C-(SA+g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>)-1000 catalyst. This speculation was also confirmed by the HR-TEM images of the Mn–N–C-(SA+g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>)-1000 catalyst in figure S4. Therefore, appropriate pyrolysis temperature was of great significance to reduce the formation of manganese oxide and achieve desired pore structure.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was utilized to study elements composition on the surface of Mn–N–C-(SA)-950, Mn–N–C-(SA+g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>)-900, Mn–N–C-(SA+g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>)-950 and Mn–N–C-(SA+g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>)-1000 catalysts [32]. In the XPS spectrum, it can be seen that the four catalysts all contained Mn, N, C and O elements (figures 4(a), S5, S6). According to the results in table S1, the Mn element content of Mn–N–C-(SA+g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>)-950 catalyst was 0.33 at. %, which was higher than that of Mn–N–C-(SA)-950 and Mn–N–C-(SA+g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>)-900 catalysts. The Mn element content of Mn–N–C-(SA+g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>)-1000 catalyst was 0.49 at. %, and a

large amount of manganese oxide was produced during the pyrolysis, consistent with the XRD pattern. The high-resolution N 1 s spectrums of the catalysts were fitted into five dominant nitrogen peaks, including pyridinic N, Mn–N, pyrrolic N, graphitic N, oxidized N [[12](#page-8-0), [33](#page-9-0)] (figure [4](#page-4-0)(b)). From the data in table S2, the graphitic N content was the highest among all nitrogen species in Mn–N–C-(SA+g-C3N4)-950 catalyst, improving the conductivity of the catalyst in the ORR process and promoting its charge mass transfer process. Compared with the other three catalysts, Mn–N– C-(SA+g-C3N4)-950 contained the highest content of Mn–N, enabling it the most electrochemical active among all the three catalysts (table S2).

# 3.2. Electrochemistry

The ORR performance of these catalysts in alkaline electrolytes was tested on an electrochemical workstation. Figure 5(a) showed the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves of Mn–N–C-(SA)-950, Mn–N–C-(SA+g-C3N4)-900, Mn–N–C-(SA+g-C3N4)-950, Mn–N–C-(SA+g-C3N4)-1000 and Pt/C catalysts with the rotation speed of 1600 rpm.

Obviously, Mn–N–C-(SA+g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>)-950 catalyst represented the superior ORR performance with  $E_{1/2}$  of 0.90 V, comparable to Pt/C catalyst. Simultaneously, according to the data in table S3, the  $E_{1/2}$  of Mn–N–C-(SA+g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>)-950 catalyst was greater than that of other Mn-based carbon catalysts in other papers during this period. The  $E_{1/2}$  of Mn–N–C-(SA)-950 catalyst was only 0.84 V. This value was 60 mV lower than the  $E_{1/2}$  of Mn–N–C-(SA+g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>)-950 catalyst. This showed that while g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> increased the micropores and mesopores, it enhanced the limiting diffusion current, and also increased the number of active sites. The  $E_{1/2}$  of Mn–N–C-(SA+g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>)-900 and Mn–N–C-(SA+g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>)-1000 catalysts were 0.88 V and 0.82 V,

quite lower than that of Mn–N–C-(SA+g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>)-950 catalyst. It could be inferred that if the temperature was too low, it was not advantageous for the coordination of Mn ions with N sources. On the contrary, when the temperature was extremely high, manganese atoms were also easy to aggregate to form manganese oxide, reducing the number of active sites. Tafel slope was an important index to evaluate the kinetics for the ORR of catalysts (figure 5(b)) [34]. The Tafel slope of Mn–N–C-(SA+g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>)-950 catalyst was not only the lowest among the catalysts, only 47.9 mV dec $^{-1}$ , but also less than 67.9 mV dec $^{-1}$  of Pt/C catalyst, showing its superior kinetics of ORR. Apart from that, the Tafel slopes of Mn–N–C-(SA)-950,

<span id="page-7-0"></span>Figure 7. (a) Diagram of Zn-air battery; (b) open-circuit voltage, (c) discharge polarization curve and power density, (d) specific capacity diagrams of  $Mn-N-C-(SA+g-C_3N_4)-950$  catalyst and Pt/C catalyst.

Mn–N–C-(SA+g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>)-900 and Mn–N–C-(SA+g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>)-1000 catalysts were 62.1, 54.8 and 65.5 mV dec $^{-1}$ , proving that the ORR kinetics of these catalysts were not up to Mn–N–C-(SA+g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>)-950 catalyst.

The electron transfer number and  $H_2O_2$  yield in ORR process were acquired through the calculation of ring current and disk current [35]. From the potential of 0.2 V to 0.8 V, the  $H_2O_2$  yield of Mn–N–C-(SA+g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>)-950 catalyst was less than 3%, and the electron transfer number was about 3.95, approximately to those of Pt/C catalyst, which demonstrated that the ORR process was a four-electron pathway [36] (figure 5(c)). Simultaneously, the LSV curves of Mn–N–C-(SA+g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>)-950 catalyst at different rotation speeds were displayed in figure 5(d).

For the purpose of testing the stability of catalysts, potential cycle tests of  $10\,000$  cycles were performed on the catalysts from  $0.6\,\mathrm{V}$  to  $1.0\,\mathrm{V}$  (figures 5(e), (f)) [37]. After  $10\,000$  cycles test, the reduction of  $E_{1/2}$  for Mn–N–C-(SA+g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>)-950 catalyst was 8 mV, and the decrease of Pt/C catalyst was 42 mV, indicating that Mn–N–C-(SA+g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>)-950 catalyst had better electrochemical stability compared with Pt/C catalyst. Moreover, the stability of Mn–N–C-(SA+g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>)-950 catalyst was the best among other Mn-based carbon catalysts for previous papers in table S3.

In order to study the electrochemical performances for Mn-N-C catalysts more comprehensively, electrochemical

tests were also carried out in 0.1 M HClO<sub>4</sub> solution. And on the basis of the LSV curves in figure 6(a), the calculated result of the  $E_{1/2}$  for Mn–N–C-(SA)-950 catalyst was 0.67 V. After adding a certain amount of g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>, the surface area and manganese element content of Mn–N–C-(SA+g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>)-950 catalyst increased significantly, and its  $E_{1/2}$  also improved to 0.74 V, as the best performance catalyst among Mn–N–C catalysts, which was lower than the  $E_{1/2}$  of 0.86 V for Pt/C catalyst. The  $E_{1/2}$  of Mn–N–C-(SA+g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>)-900 catalyst and Mn–N–C-(SA+g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>)-1000 catalyst were 0.72 V and 0.55 V, respectively.

Additionally, the Tafel slope of Mn–N–C-(SA+g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>)-950 catalyst was  $66.3 \, \text{mV} \, \text{dec}^{-1}$ , somewhat higher than the  $64.2 \, \text{mV} \, \text{dec}^{-1}$  of Pt/C catalyst in figure 6(b). And the Tafel slopes of Mn–N–C-(SA)-950, Mn–N–C-(SA+g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>)-900 and Mn–N–C-(SA+g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>)-1000 catalysts were 75.1,  $68.0 \, \text{m} \, \text{dec}^{-1}$ . These values proved that Mn–N–C-(SA+g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>)-950 catalyst had superior kinetic performance than other catalysts and was comparable to Pt/C catalyst.

As shown in figure 6(c), the  $H_2O_2$  yield of Mn–N–C-(SA+g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>)-950 catalyst remained the value less than 3%, and its electron transfer number was approximately equal to 3.94, with a four-electron pathway like Pt/C catalyst. Besides, figure 6(d) showed the LSV curves of Mn–N–C-(SA+g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>)-950 catalyst at different rotation speeds. The

<span id="page-8-0"></span>results of testing the stability for catalysts in the acid electrolyte were shown in figures 6(e) and (f). The  $E_{1/2}$  of Mn–N–C-(SA+g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>)-950 catalyst was reduced by 18 mV after 10 000 potential cycles, indicating that it had superior stability to Pt/C catalyst with the 45 mV decrease of  $E_{1/2}$  in acid electrolyte.

The configuration schematic of Zn-air battery was exhibited in figure 7(a). Mn-N-C-(SA+g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>)-950 catalyst was used as the cathode to prepare Zn-air battery, and its open circuit voltage reached 1.495 V, somewhat higher than the 1.487 V of Pt/C catalyst. On the basis of curves in figure 7(c), the maximum power densities of Mn–N–C-(SA+g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>)-950 catalyst and Pt/C catalyst could be calculated. The power density of Mn-N-C- $(SA+g-C_3N_4)-950$  catalyst was  $131 \text{ mW cm}^{-2}$ , exceeding the 119 mW cm<sup>-2</sup> of Pt/C. After that, the specific capacity of the battery was tested at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> (figure 7(d)). According to calculation, Mn-N-C-(SA+g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>)-950 catalyst specific capacity was 737 mAh g<sup>-1</sup>, extremely better than Pt/C catalyst specific capacity with 683 mAh g<sup>-1</sup>. In short, Mn-N-C-(SA+g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>)-950 catalyst had more excellent open circuit voltage, power density and specific capacity than Pt/C catalyst. These advantages indicate that Mn-N-C-(SA+ g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>)-950 catalyst has bright prospects employed as an ORR catalyst in Zn-air batteries.

# 4. Conclusions

In brief, highly active manganese and nitrogen co-doped carbon Mn-N-C ORR catalyst was prepared by using the hydrogel formed by the coordination of manganese ions with SA and g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> as the precursor. The g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> was introduced to raise the surface area of the final catalyst and also function as the nitrogen source to form the catalytic active sites. After ball milling, freeze-drying and pyrolysis of the hydrogel and g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> mixture, catalysts with abundant hierarchical pore structure were obtained. The optimum Mn-N-C-(SA+ g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>)-950 catalyst exhibited exceptional ORR activity in alkaline electrolytes, and its  $E_{1/2}$  was 0.90 V. Moreover, the  $Mn-N-C-(SA+g-C_3N_4)-950$  showed superior stability in alkaline and acidic electrolytes. Apart from this, the performance of the Zn-air battery using Mn-N-C-(SA+g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>)-950 as the cathodic catalyst was excellent, with the maximum power density up to 131 mW cm<sup>-2</sup>. This research demonstrates a novel way to synthesize high-efficient Mn-N-C catalysts, and it may inspire the preparation of other non platinum group metal ORR catalysts.

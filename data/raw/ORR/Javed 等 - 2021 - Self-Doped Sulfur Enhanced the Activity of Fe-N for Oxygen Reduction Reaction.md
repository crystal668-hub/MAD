The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is an important electrochemical reaction for fuel cells and metal-air batteries. A highly-active and stable electrocatalyst is required to improve the sluggish kinetics of the ORR. In this work, a novel electrocatalyst with Fe atoms coordinated on a N-doped carbon support was designed using biowaste (peanut shells) as the source of carbon, sulfur, and nitrogen. Moreover, by controlling the electron-donating/withdrawing properties of the carbon skeleton, an instinctive design strategy that combines sulfur functionalities was used to modify and boost the catalytic activity of Fe-N active sites. The synthesized Fe-N/S-C catalyst exhibited excellent ORR performance, with a half-wave potential of 0.87 V vs RHE, a limiting current density of 5.21 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, and an onset potential of 1.13 V in 0.1 M KOH solution. Additionally, this peanut shell-derived Fe-N/S-C catalyst was applied in a zinc-air battery (ZAB) as an air cathode, which displayed a power density of 190 mW cm<sup>-2</sup>. © 2021 The Electrochemical Society ("ECS").

Significant research has been performed to design safe, robust, and cost-effective energy conversion and storage systems such as metal-air batteries and polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells to overcome the severe environmental deterioration due to overreliance on fossil fuels. Increasing the number of green and sustainable energy sources to meet ever-increasing energy demands has been a popular research topic.<sup>2,3</sup> There is a need to increase the commercialization of electrochemical devices in the world.<sup>4-6</sup> Among metal-air batteries, Zn-air batteries (ZABs) have gained interest as one of the most feasible future options for powering energy grids and electric vehicles.<sup>7,8</sup> Platinum-based (Pt) catalysts are the most commonly used electrocatalysts for the cathodic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR)<sup>9,10</sup> however, the high cost of Pt hinder its commercialization.<sup>11</sup> Thus, catalysts with viable activities and lower costs must be developed.1

Non-precious transition-metal-based materials (M = Fe, Co, Ni) co-doped with nitrogen are efficient ORR catalysts with very similar electrocatalytic performance to that of noble metal catalysts. 13-15 So far, improvements in the catalytic performance have been made by adopting a bimetallic approach for creating dual active sites (i.e., Fe-Co-N-C), <sup>16–18</sup> using a soft or hard template method to control the morphology, 19-21 or metal-organic framework-derived Fe/N-doped hierarchical carbon architectures to enhance the active surface area.<sup>22–24</sup> Developing novel synthetic pathways to produce additional exposed active sites to boost the catalytic performance has been a main focus of research. 25-28

The use of heteroatoms (N, P, S, and B) to dope porous carbon materials alters the charge distribution and increases the enrichment and adsorption of oxygen;<sup>29</sup> however, the complicated synthesis pathways and hazardous precursors are critical hurdles that prevent doping with heteroatoms. Biomass materials are important candidates because of their low cost, easy conversion to functional materials, nontoxicity, abundance, and environmental-friendliness. Carbon-based ORR catalysts have been produced from various precursors, including willow catkin, 30 rice husk, 31 pomelo leaves, 32 coconut shells, 33 and walnut shells.

Inspired by the above ideas, here we introduce a facile strategy that uses low-cost and abundant peanut shells (PS) as a precursor to prepare a microporous three-dimensional (3D) graphitic carbon framework intrinsically doped with C, S, and N (dry matter contains C: 55%; O: 32%; H: 6.5%; N: 1.5%, and S: 2.1%), which was extrinsically doped with Fe to increase the number of active sites. This process used potassium hydroxide (KOH) as an activating agent and hydrazine as a reducing agent to form a unique hierarchical three-dimensional structure that contained a large number of micro- and mesopores and a high specific surface area. The inclusion of Fe and dual-doping by N/S imbued the Fe-N/S-C catalyst with a high catalytic activity, good stability, and tolerance to methanol crossover. The Fe-N/S-C exhibited an overall superior ORR catalytic activity compared with a commercial Pt/C catalyst, with a half-wave potential  $(E_{1/2})$  and onset potential (E<sub>onset</sub>) of 0.87 V and 1.13 V in 0.1 M KOH, respectively. A highlydefective carbon structure was formed due to heteroatom doping, which produced more active sites and improved the performance. This study provides the first time that PS-based biowaste has shown such good performance, making it a potential candidate for application as an oxygen electrocatalyst for ZABs.

### **Experimental**

Materials.—All the chemicals were of analytical ranking and used without additional refinement. The peanut shells were obtained from Shanghai, KOH, Fe(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>. 9H<sub>2</sub>O, Urea (CO(NH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>), hydrazine (N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>), ethanol (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OH), deionized (DI) water, and H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> were obtained from Sinoparm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Shanghai.

Synthesis process of Fe-N/S-C catalysts.—A typical synthesis process is shown in Scheme S1. Peanut shells (PS), previously washed with water, were immersed in 7% KOH solution followed by carbonization at 400 °C for 2 h. The carbonized PS was immersed in 1 M N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> solution and kept for 1 hr at room temperature, followed by separation and drying at 60°C. Then 1 g of carbonized PS and 10 mg of Fe(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>.9H<sub>2</sub>O were dispersed in 10 ml of DI water under vigorous stirring for 12 h. The reaction composites were instantly frozen by liquid nitrogen and lyophilized in the freeze dryer for 12 h. After lyophilization, the dark black powder was heat-treated under  $N_2$  atmosphere at 800 °C for 2 h in the presence of  $CO(NH_2)_2$ . Finally, the black powder was washed with 0.5 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> and DI water to remove the unbound metal and impurities. The obtained product was dried at 60 °C for 12 h in a vacuum oven and marked as Fe-N/S-C.

As comparision, Fe-N/S-C(WH) (WH signifies without N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> etching) and S-N-C (S/N dual doped C without Fe(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>.9H<sub>2</sub>O) with the same synthesis procedure were prepared.

Physical and chemical characterization.—The morphology and porosity of the as-prepared catalysts were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (JSM-6700F), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) JEM-2100F, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) was examined in real-time using a Titan Themis transmission electron microscopy furnished with a CEOS probe 200 KV image aberration corrector. The structural investigation was carried out by X-ray diffraction (XRD) (D/MAX2500V+/PC, a Cu K $\alpha$ irradiation source ( $\lambda = 1.54056 \text{ Å}$ )) with a scan speed of  $0.5^{\circ} \text{ m}^{-1}$ ). The specific surface area and particle size of the samples were calculated via the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) (ASAP 2020 Micromeritics apparatus) process based on nitrogen adsorption/ desorption isotherm curves. The chemical composition and elemental content of as-synthesized electrocatalysts were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) Thermo Scientific K-ALPHA.

*Electrochemical measurement.*—Catalyst ink was prepared by sonicating, 5 mg of catalyst in 990  $\mu$ l of ethanol-DI water (v/v = 5:5) mixed solution and 10  $\mu$ l of Nafion (5%) solution for 25 min. The surface of the glassy carbon electrode was consecutively polished with 0.3  $\mu$ m and 0.05  $\mu$ m alumina powder and washed with DI water and ethanol. 10  $\mu$ l of the catalyst ink with the loading of 0.403 mg cm<sup>-2</sup> was then pipetted onto the glassy carbon electrode (4 mm diameter), and used as working electrode. With the same mass loading, commercial Pt/C (20 wt%) as a reference catalyst was also tested under the same conditions. The Ag/AgCl and Pt wire were used as a reference and counter electrode, respectively.

The electrochemical measurements, including cyclic voltammetry (CV) and linear scan voltammetry (LSV), were carried out in 0.1 M KOH solution ( $O_2$  saturated) through a conventional three-electrode system with CHI760E (Chenhua instrument) using rotating disc electrode (RDE).

The ORR polarization curves were measured in 0.1 M KOH solution by LSV with scan rate of  $10\,\mathrm{mV\,s^{-1}}$  at different rotation speeds. The CV test was carried out in the potential window of 0.6 to 1 V for stability evaluation. LSV was done before and after cycling stability to compare the change of  $E_{1/2}$ . The selectivity of the process was determined through a rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE) experiment. The number of electrons transfer was calculated through the following equation:

$$n = 4 * \left(\frac{I_D}{I_D + I_R/N}\right)$$

In the above equation,  $I_R$  and  $I_D$  are the ring current and disk current obtained at a potential value of 0.4 V, and N is the ring efficiency, whose value in the current case is 0.424. The  $H_2O_2$  yield was calculated through the following relation:

$$H_2O_2(\%) = 200 * (I_R/N/(I_D + I_R/N))$$

The double-layer capacitance (Cdl) was evaluated from the CV curves at different scan rates in the potential region of 1.0 to 1.1 V vs RHE.

The ZAB performances were tested in a homemade setup to evaluate the as-prepared catalysts. The electrochemical cell of ZAB was composed of electrolyte (6 M KOH  $\pm$  0.2 M Zn (Ac)2), anode (polished Zn plate) and cathode (hydrophobic carbon cloth coated with catalyst ink). The polarization curves were recorded from the CHI760E workstation through LSV (10 mV s $^{-1}$ ) to describe ZABs performance. The galvanostatic discharge measurements were obtained at a current density of 10 mA cm $^{-2}$ . The energy density was calculated based on the average discharge voltage (V), applied current (I, mA cm $^{-2}$ ), service time (t, sec), and weight of zinc consumed (Wzn, g):

Energy density(Wh Kg<sup>-1</sup>) = 
$$I_*V_*t/W_{zn}$$

#### Results and Discussion

A simple synthesis route for anchoring Fe atoms onto the surface of 3D hierarchical porous graphitic structures using PS as a source of C, S, and N without the addition of any template is depicted in Fig. 1. The formation of a 3D hierarchical porous graphitic structure was formed during the lyophilization and pyrolysis of the precursor. Due to the slow evaporation of water during lyophilization, Fe ions were uniformly distributed in a homogeneous solution of carbonized biomass. Furthermore, the black powder obtained at the end of this process was carbonized at 800 °C for 2 h in the presence of CO(NH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub> (decomposition temperature: 160 °C), which is used as an external nitrogen source to enhance the N content inside 3D hierarchical porous graphitic structures. <sup>35,36</sup> Further increasing the

temperature from 400 °C to 600 °C, resulted in a redox reaction (carbon oxidation) that formed  $K_2CO_3$ . After raising the reaction temperature to 700 °C, some  $K_2O$  was also formed.<sup>37,38</sup> Finally, at 800 °C, after the decomposition of  $K_2O$ , only metallic K species remained after pyrolysis, which can be released by sublimation from in situ-formed carbon structures to create micro- and mesopores.<sup>39</sup> At the end of this process, the pyrolyzed product Fe-N/S-C was washed by 0.5 M  $H_2SO_4$  aqueous solution and DI water to remove unbound metal and impurities.

Morphological study of the prepared samples.—In this study, abundant cellulosic broils and multilamellar tissues of PS were pyrolyzed at 800 °C to obtain an interconnected graphitic structure. The morphology of Fe-N/S-C, S-N-C, and Fe-N/S-C(WH) samples are given in Fig. 2a and Fig. S2 (available online at stacks.iop.org/JES/168/046512/mmedia). PS without KOH activation exhibited a sheet-like irregular structure with few pores. After activation with KOH, it showed a smooth surface with many homogeneously distributed pores, which were mainly micropores and mesopores, as shown in Figs. S2c and S2d. After the metal precursor was added, the obtained Fe-N/S-C catalyst showed a much spongier honeycomb-like porous structure, as illustrated in Fig. 2a. Thus, the obtained catalyst had many exposed active sites, which can facilitate electrolyte penetration, reduce ion diffusion distance, and provide areas for ion and mass transport.<sup>40</sup>

These pores originated from the oxidation and continuous decomposition of organic compounds of PS during pyrolysis. As carbonaceous material was heated in KOH under an inert atmosphere at temperatures over 700 °C, metallic potassium (K),  $K_2O$ ,  $CO_2$ , and CO were produced. The metallic K and  $CO_2$  gas contributed to the development of pores, which improved the surface area.

The TEM image in Fig. 2b shows a porous thin-layered graphitic structure, in accordance with the SEM images. The porous surface helps increase the surface area and improves mass transport. The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images in Figs. S2h and S2i show no nanoparticle or bulk formation in the composite when Fe was introduced into the interplanar spaces of the carbonaceous material, which indicates that Fe-containing active species were distributed homogeneously in the interplanar spaces. <sup>41</sup>

To investigate the metal atom content in the catalyst, high-resolution STEM measurements were performed (Fig. 2c). The homogeneously distributed bright spots scattered throughout the carbon framework represent Fe atoms. HAADF-STEM mapping images of Fe-N/S-C demonstrate that C, N, Fe, and S atoms were successfully doped and scattered homogeneously in the porous structure, as shown in Fig. 2d.

The structural analysis and degree of crystallinity of the prepared materials were investigated by XRD patterns. As shown in Fig. 3a, a broad diffraction peak appeared at approximately 24°, while a second peak was located at 43.8° in all synthesized catalysts, which corresponded to the (002) and (101) facets of graphitic carbon, respectively. These peaks indicate the strong graphitic character and low crystallinity of all prepared catalysts.

 $N_2$  adsorption-desorption isotherms were measured to study the specific surface area and type of pores present in Fe-N/S-C (Fig. 3b), which shows type IV isotherms with a hysteresis loop, indicating the co-existence of micropores and mesopores. The hierarchical porosity of the catalyst was verified by calculating the pore volumes, pore size distribution (Fig. S3b), and surface areas (Fig. S3a). The largest BET specific surface area (1028  $\rm m^2~g^{-1})$  and pore volume (0.79  $\rm cm^3~g^{-1})$  were obtained for Fe-N/S-C. These values are relatively highest among the prepared catalysts, as shown in Table SI. The increased surface area was due to the presence of micropores in the catalyst, while the mesopores helped reactants and electrolytes reach active sites of the catalysts during electrolyte wetting.

XPS was used to test the elemental composition and chemical states of Fe-N/S-C. The XPS survey spectrum in Fig. 3c displays a major peak at 399.9 eV for N, a peak at 284 eV for C, a peak at 531 eV for O, a peak at 168 eV for S, and an Fe peak at 710 eV. Because of the low contents of S and Fe, their corresponding peaks are very weak. The high-resolution N 1 s spectrum contained four peaks for pyridinic (398.2 eV), Fe-N (399.4 eV), pyrrolic (400.3 eV), and graphitic nitrogen (401.0 eV), as shown in Fig. 3d, <sup>42,43</sup> which indicates the doping of N in the carbon framework during pyrolysis. It has been reported that N dopants can adsorb molecular oxygen and intermediates through breaking the electroneutrality of carbon by withdrawing electrons from carbon. <sup>44</sup> The Fe 2p spectrum in Fig. S3c shows that the Fe species were represented by two pairs of characteristic peaks. <sup>43–45</sup> The peak at 713 eV corresponds to Fe 2p<sub>3/2</sub> of Fe<sup>3+</sup> and Fe<sup>2+</sup>, while the peak at 724 eV

The S 2p spectrum of Fe–N/S–C displayed two distinct characteristic peaks (Fig. 3f)<sup>46</sup>. The one centered at 163.8 eV belongs to S atoms connected to carbon (i.e., S–C), and the second peak at 168.2 eV was ascribed to oxidized S species (i.e., S–Ox)<sup>47,48</sup> The synergistic effect of N/S co-doping increased the electrical conductivity and charge distribution of carbon materials.  $^{26,49}$ 

The atomic percentages of different elements such as N, O, C, and S calculated from XPS spectra and the Fe content determined from inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) of the Fe-N/S-C are given in Table SII.

**Electrochemical measurements.**—The electrocatalytic ORR performance was measured in 0.1 M KOH using an RDE. The CV curves were taken both in  $O_2$  and  $N_2$ -saturated 0.1 M KOH solution, as shown in Fig. S5a. A distinct reduction peak was observed at 0.81 V in  $O_2$ -saturated KOH solution, while no such peak was spotted in the  $N_2$ -saturated electrolyte, which suggests that the reduction current comes from the ORR. To gain further insight into the ORR activity, LSV polarization curves were taken in  $O_2$ -saturated 0.1 M KOH solution. For comparison, under the same experimental conditions, prepared control samples and 20%

Pt/C with the same catalyst loading were also tested. The specific performance is shown in Table SIII, such as S-N-C with  $E_{1/2}$  of 0.83 V and  $J_{\rm L}$  of 4.51 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, and Fe-N/S-C (WH) with an  $E_{1/2}$  of 0.85 V and  $J_{\rm L}$  of 5.20 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. In contrast, Fe-N/S-C, as shown in Figs. 4a, 4b, exhibited the highest  $E_{1/2}$  of 0.87 V and  $J_{\rm L}$  of 5.21 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, which can be attributed to the 3D hierarchical porous structure with a high surface area and N/S dual-doping of Fe-N-C active sites. These factors collectively played important roles in boosting the intrinsic activity, which improved the ORR performance.

The linearity of the Koutecky-Levich (K-L) plots for Fe-N/S-C determines the first-order reaction kinetics, and the slope of the K-L equation fitting in the inset of Fig. 4a shows that the electron transfer number is 3.9 over the potential range from 0.2 to 0.6 V in 0.1 M KOH, confirming that the ORR followed a four-electron transfer reaction. Tafel plots were also obtained, as shown in Fig. 4c. Fe-N/S-C showed a Tafel slope of 85 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>, which is lower than that of commercial Pt/C (94 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>), Fe-N/S-C (WH) (105 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>), and S-N-C 118 mV dec<sup>-1</sup> in alkaline media. This demonstrates that the Fe-N/S-C catalyst has the fastest reaction kinetics.

Additionally, by performing RRDE tests, the yield of the peroxide intermediate formed during the ORR was calculated. The  $H_2O_2$  yield of Fe-N/S-C was around 5%, while Fe-N/S-C (WH) was 7% at all potential ranges in 0.1 M KOH, as shown in Fig. 4d,

<span id="page-5-0"></span>**Figure 4.** LSV curve in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte (a) at different rpm for the Fe-N/S-C catalyst (inset K-L plot at different potential); (b) at 1600 rpm for all catalysts; (c) Tafel plots of all prepared catalysts with Pt/C (20%) at 1600 rpm and (d) Peroxide percentage (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>%) from RRDE measurements for all prepared catalysts.

suggesting it can be used for the highly efficient conversion of  $\mathrm{O}_2$  to  $\mathrm{OH}^-$ .

The excellent performance of Fe-N/S-C can be attributed to the following reasons: 1) The use of KOH as an activating agent increased the porosity, which produced a large surface area. Consequently, the mass transport properties were improved, such as reducing the path lengths of the electrolyte and oxygen; 2) The use of  $N_2H_4$  as a reducing agent after carbonization to selectively remove oxygen to balance the C:O ratio helped create and expose more active sites and increase the porosity and surface area; 3) The doping of S produced more defects in the carbon matrix by charge redistribution in the carbon layer. The increase in the N content, especially pyridinic and graphitic N, increased the number of active sites; 4) By doping with Fe metal, the ORR performance was promoted compared with catalysts without Fe; thus, the high porosity and surface area, N/S co-doping, and Fe metal atoms all helped improve the ORR performance.

Besides the electrocatalytic activity, the electrochemical stability and tolerance to fuel poisoning are crucial for developing efficient ORR catalysts used in cathodic reactions. Remarkably, after 2000 CV cycles, there was no apparent decline in the reduction peak or  $E_{1/2}$ , indicating the superior stability of Fe-N/S-C (Figs. 5a, 5b). Moreover, it maintained 99% of its initial current after current-time measurements at a constant potential of 0.6 V in 0.1 M KOH solution under continuous bubbling of  $O_2$ . In contrast, commercial 20% Pt/C retained only 97%, as shown in Fig. 5c. The TEM image (Fig. 5d) of the catalyst after 2000 cycles showed no apparent changes, confirming the good stability of the Fe-N/S-C catalyst in the basic electrolyte. The high durability and efficiency of Fe-N/S-C during oxygen reduction arose from the rich N/S coordinated sites

with Fe, as well as the high porosity of the carbon assembly. As shown in Fig. S5b, Fe-N/S-C displayed constant retention of its current density (without a distinct delay) after introducing 4 ml methanol into the electrolyte solution. In contrast, after adding the same amount of methanol into the electrolyte solution, there was an apparent current decrease for commercial Pt/C. These results confirmed that Fe-N/S-C exhibits exceptional tolerance to methanol crossover.

Furthermore, to highlight the excellent ORR performance, the electrochemically-active surface area (ECSA) was evaluated in the non-Faradaic region, signified by the double-layer capacitance ( $C_{\rm dl}$ ) of the prepared catalysts. The  $C_{\rm dl}$  of Fe-N/S-C was 14 mF cm<sup>-2</sup> higher than that of Fe-N/S-C (WH) (8 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>), as illustrated in Fig S6, further confirming that Fe-N/S-C is the best ORR catalyst. Besides, a decline of only 1 mF cm<sup>-2</sup> was observed after 2000 cycles (Fig. S6a), which further demonstrates the stability of this catalyst.

The performance of a Zn-air battery.—A homemade ZAB (Fig. 6a) was constructed using Fe-N/S-C as the air cathode and Zn foil as the anode to evaluate its potential for practical energy devices. The battery test was performed at room temperature to evaluate the power density and obtain the corresponding polarization plots of the synthesized catalysts. In Fig. 6b, Fe-N/S-C, the air cathode, displays a maximum power density of 190 mW cm<sup>-2</sup>, which is larger than that of Fe-N/S-C (WH) (125 mW cm<sup>-2</sup>), and commercial Pt/C (156 mW cm<sup>-2</sup>). Moreover, the specific capacities of the ZAB with Fe-N/S-C and Pt/C (20%) air cathodes were normalized to the mass of consumed Zn and estimated to be 730 mAh g<sup>-1</sup> and 687 mAh g<sup>-1</sup> at a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>

(Fig. 6c), which is only 12.6% lower than the theoretical capacity of 828 mAh g<sup>-1.50</sup> The galvanostatic discharge curves of the Fe-N/S-C fabricated battery showed exceptional discharge constancies at current densities from 2 to 50 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> (Fig. 6d). The 3D hierarchical graphitic porous structure promoted the transfer of electrons and Zn ions and also eased the electrolyte penetration and decreased the ion diffusion distance; thus, the prepared catalyst Fe-N/S-C has the potential for practical applications in primary ZABs.

#### Conclusions

Here, using renewable and low-cost biowaste precursors, we demonstrated a new scalable, facile, sustainable, and eco-friendly approach for preparing self-co-doped S, N, and extrinsically doped Fe electrocatalysts (Fe-N/S-C) with high ORR activity. The excellent performance of Fe-N/S-C was attributed to the following reasons: 1) The 3D hierarchical microporous graphitic morphology of the catalyst showed a high surface area and numerous pores that increased the exposed surface area available for the catalytic reaction; 2) Sulfur self-doping helped create more defects, which further boosted the ORR activity in an alkaline electrolyte; 3) By the dual-doping of N/S, the electrical conductivity and charge density of the carbon materials was improved; 4) The use of N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> as a reducing agent after carbonization at room temperature removes oxygen selectively from the peripheral sites of the carbon framework for balancing the C:O ratio suitable for good activity, 5) With Fe metal doping, the ORR performance was mostly enhanced compared with catalysts without Fe doping; therefore, Fe-N/S-C showed better performance than commercial Pt/C (20 wt%) during the RDE tests and when used in a ZAB. These results demonstrate the excellent ORR performance of these catalysts and suggest that they are a viable alternative for producing non-precious-metal carbon electrocatalysts using sustainable biomass resources.

Nitrogen-doped ordered mesoporous carbons (N-OMCs) with different morphologies are prepared as oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts through pyrolysis of iron phthalocyanineinfiltrated SBA-15 silica with different mesochannel lengths. Excellent ORR activity with a nearly four-electron transfer process is observed in both alkaline and acidic media. In particular, the difference in half-wave potential for ORR relative to commercial Pt/C catalyst is only 50 mV negative in acidic medium, whereas it is 50 mV more positive in alkaline medium. Interestingly, it is found that although the use of iron is necessary for the preparation of highly active nitrogen-doped ORR carbon catalysts, its presence is not necessary for N-OMC to be active in the ORR in either alkaline or acidic media. In addition, the ORR activity increases gradually with decreasing mesopore channel length, with maximum activity in N-OMC with short channels, demonstrating the high synergistic influence of structural morphology on ORR in heteroatom-doped carbon.

# Introduction

The fuel cell is considered as the most promising renewable and green energy technology due to its high energy and power densities and negligible pollutant emissions. Of the several kinds of fuel cell technology, proton exchange membrane fuel cells and alkaline fuel cells have been the subject of intense research and development because their low operating temperature allows instant start-up, in contrast to other types of fuel cells. The biggest hurdle with these fuel cells has been the effective achievement of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in the cathode, which requires high amounts of catalyst to decrease high overpotentials.[1] Although carbon-supported platinum-based materials have proven the most promising catalysts for the ORR, Pt has several disadvantages such as low durability due to dissolution, susceptibility to the methanol crossover effect, limited supply, high cost and facile carbon monoxide poisoning.[2] The commercialisation of fuel cell technologies has thus been hampered and the drive to find highly efficient but non-precious metal or metal-free alternatives is ever-increasing. As the most prominent development in this initiative, heteroatom-doped nanostructured carbon materials have emerged with excellent potential. Particularly, nitrogen doping has attracted a great deal of attention as the most plausible solution, due to the excellent catalytic activity and far better selectivity and durability produced compared to Pt/C.[2b,3] The difference in size and electronegativity between nitrogen and carbon not only leads to the creation of abundant high energy defect sites on the surface but also changes the charge density around the carbon atoms neighbouring the heteroatom, making the carbon surface either electron-rich or electron-deficient and generating large numbers of active surface sites.[3a,4] Oxygen molecules are chemisorbed on these active surface sites and reduced at lower overpotentials. Moreover, the covalent nature of the bonding between the heteroatom and carbon ensures minimal fading of activity over time and even in the presence of methanol.

Generally, two different approaches have been followed for the synthesis of these heteroatom-doped carbon catalysts. One is the use of single and multiple heteroatoms such as phosphorus, boron, sulphur and nitrogen.[3a,5] The carbon catalysts developed by this approach have been found to have excellent electrocatalytic activity in alkaline media,[6] albeit no reasonable activity in acidic media. Relative to Pt/C, the difference in the half-wave potential for ORR has been shown to be

within 25 mV in alkaline electrolytes but greater than 200 mV in acidic electrolytes.[6b] Another approach is the anchoring of abundant transition metals such as iron, cobalt or nickel as activity-enhancing agents to heteroatom-doped carbon, which is based on the proven activity of iron- and cobalt-containing metal organic frameworks in the ORR in both alkaline and acidic media.[7] In this approach, the metal is incorporated into the carbon framework either through addition of the metal salt with a carbon precursor or by using metal organic frameworks as the sole precursor. [3a,6a] These classes of non-precious metal catalysts have also resulted in enhancement of activity in alkaline media very close to that of Pt/C. However, the activity was still lower than Pt/C in acidic media and the exact role of metal remained highly ambiguous.[6a] The presence of the C-N-M (M=Fe, Co or Ni) structure is thought by some to facilitate the ORR in these non-precious metal catalysts, whereas others propose that the transition metals are not a part of the active site but rather serve to facilitate the incorporation of nitrogen into the carbon matrix.[8]

Another way to achieve high electrocatalytic activity in heteroatom-doped carbon-based electrocatalysts is by controlling their textural properties such as surface area, pore volume, pore size and structural integrity. High surface area and pore volume can significantly enhance the volumetric density of active surface sites and the appropriate pore size and structural integrity can facilitate unrestricted flow of reactants towards those active sites. Carbon materials with high textural properties are synthesised usually by chemical and physical activation or by using a hard template such as silica.[9] In general, the hard template-based method has many advantages including good control of textural properties such as the capacity to tailor the structural morphology, tune the pore size and distribution and create high surface area and pore volume, which is not possible in other pore-generating approaches such as physical or chemical activation.

Several porous silica template-based carbon nanostructures have been explored for different kinds of electrochemical applications, revealing the tremendous influence of the textural properties on electrochemical performance.[5c,10] Among them, ordered mesoporous carbon (OMC) is regarded as an excellent model electrode material because it possesses excellent surface properties and high structural uniformity with a narrow pore size distribution. [11] Although many attempts have been made to increase surface properties such as surface area and pore volume to improve performance, little attempt has been made to control structural properties such as mesopore channel length and mesopore size, which can have profound effects on the reaction kinetics in OMC.[12] Compared to common OMC with long mesopore channels, OMC with short mesopore channels is likely to be more favourable for reactants, products and electrolyte to pass through, boosting reaction kinetics. Thus, structural properties such as mesopore channel length and structural morphology should be optimised for better performance. Significant enhancement in activity can be expected by the synergistic contribution of such favourable structural properties in addition to heteroatom doping.

In this work, we investigate the role of iron species and textural properties for determining electrocatalytic activity in a carbon catalyst to obtain a synergistic combination of both effects. For this study, we have synthesised nitrogen-doped OMC by using iron phthalocyanine as both iron precursor and nitrogen and carbon source and mesoporous SBA-15 silica as a hard template. To study the possible effect of textural properties, we have synthesised four different OMCs with different mesopore channel lengths by varying the templates. It is found from the ORR study that both the iron complex as precursor and textural properties of OMC play a vital role in the electrocatalytic performance.[13] The best catalyst found in this study has not only outperformed the commercial Pt/C catalyst in all performance parameters in alkaline medium but also narrowed the onset potential gap in acidic medium to 40 mV.

# Results and Discussion

The fabrication process of N-OMC is represented in Scheme 1, further details of which can be found in the Experimental Sec-

Scheme 1. N-OMC synthesis.

tion. Briefly, iron phthalocyanine (250 mg) and mesoporous SBA-15 silica template (500 mg) were mixed thoroughly in a vortex to a homogenous solid mixture and the mixture pyrolysed at 900 8C in an argon environment, followed by removal of the silica template by hydrogen fluoride etching to obtain silica-free N-OMC. Four different types of N-OMC samples with different morphologies were synthesised by varying the SBA-15 templates and labelled as N-OMC-p, N-OMC-s, N-OMC-m, and N-OMC-l according to mesochannel length and morphology (p=platelet-type and s=rugby ball-type ellipsoidal morphologies; m=medium length and l=long-rod mesochannels).

The structure and morphology of synthesised N-OMC samples were characterised through various electron microscopic observations, as shown in Figure 1. An ultra-high-resolution (UHR)-SEM image in the lateral view of N-OMC-p showing a thin plate or disk-like morphology is shown in Figure 1 a, with mesopores developed along the edge thickness indicated by arrows. Short and vertical pore channels can be observed clearly in high-magnification UHR-SEM images (Figure S1, Supporting Information). A TEM image of the uniform pore morphology of N-OMC-p with a hexagonal arrangement of the carbon fibres is shown in Figure 1 b. Field-emission (FE)-SEM images of N-OMC-p, N-OMC-s, N-OMC-m, and N-OMC-l are shown in Figure 1 c–f, respectively. N-OMC-m and N-OMC-l show typical rod-type morphologies and N-OMC-s takes a rugby ball or rice grain-like ellipsoidal shape.

In these cases, the mesopore channels run parallel to the direction of the rod. This demonstrates an interesting morphological change in the OMC materials from rod to ellipsoid shapes and, finally, to thin plate shapes with a gradual decrease of the mesopore channel length accompanied by a gradual increase in the cross-sectional width. In particular, N-OMC-p shows a unique hexagonal prism-like platelet morphology, which represents near-perfect growth as a giant crystalline structure developed from a single hexagonal unit cell, providing a faithful replication of the silica template with hexagonal symmetry. Mesopore channel length can be determined from the FE-SEM images of the N-OMCs. Increasing mesopore channel length from 184 to 675, 960, and 1300 nm is accompanied by a corresponding decrease in width from 705 to 420, 215, and 130 nm for N-OMC-p, N-OMC-s, N-OMC-m, and N-OMC-l, respectively (Figure 1 c–f). Interestingly, aspect ratio, which is the ratio of mesochannel length to cross-sectional diameter, varies from 0.3 to 1.6, 4.5 and 10. Such significant change in mesopore channel length can have tremendous effect on the transfer of reactants towards the inner surface active sites.

To get more information on surface properties, the materials were investigated by using the nitrogen adsorption–desorption technique. The corresponding BET isotherms of the N-OMCs, which can be classified as type IV isotherms typical of mesoporous materials with a distinct hysteresis loop in the relative pressure regions of 0.3 to 1.0, are shown in Figure 1 g. The pore size distribution was derived from analysis of the adsorption branch through the BJH method and the pore size found to be approximately 3.1 nm in all N-OMC samples (see Figure S2). Interestingly, the BET surface area was found to decrease with increasing mesopore channel length from 1720 to 1629, 1329, and 1122 m 2g ¢1 for N-OMC-p, N-OMC-s, N-OMC-m, and N-OMC-l, respectively, as summarised in Table S1. Notably, the micropore volume is almost the same in N-OMC-p and N-OMC-s but lower in N-OMC-m and N-OMC-l, whereas the mesopore volume is highest in N-OMC-p. It is thus important to observe the effect of these variations in textural properties on the electrocatalytic performance. Interestingly, undoped platelet OMP-p has a larger pore size of 3.4 nm compared to N-OMC-p, indicating that pore size decreases upon doping in this system. Both surface area and total pore volume increased significantly after doping. In particular, micropore volume increased, with mesopore volume remaining almost identical upon doping, as shown in Table S1. The nitrogen content and its bonding nature with the parent carbon framework in N-OMCs was analysed by using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Based on the XPS survey scan spectra in Figure S3, all of the N-OMCs have a distinct N1s signature, as expected. Interestingly, contrary to our expectations after synthesis, no iron signal can be observed in the XPS survey scan. An iron signal is observed before hydrogen fluoride etching and disappears after etching, as shown in the XPS spectra in Figure S4 a. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of N-OMC-p before and after hydrogen fluoride etching also indicate the presence of iron in the carbon framework before hydrogen fluoride etching, as shown in Figure S4b. Further verification by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis (Figure S4 c and d) also yielded the same result, finally indicating that iron species and particles remaining on the surface of the composites were removed during silica etching by hydrogen fluoride. The XPS, XRD and EDS studies confirm that active species for ORR do not include iron.

The total nitrogen content in each of the N-OMCs was found to be similar at approximately 3.5–3.7 at.% as determined by XPS. The relative amounts of four types of nitrogen moieties, that is, pyridinic at 398.3 eV, pyrrolic at 400.5 eV, quaternary at 401.5 eV, and terminal N¢O at 403.5 eV, were calculated to be 36.54, 12.15, 46.19, and 5.12%, respectively for N-OMC-p. The relative content was found to be almost the same in all of the N-OMCs, thereby proving the reproducibility of the synthesis process. This allowed for correlation of the possible variation in ORR activity with textural parameters. The C 1s spectrum of N-OMC-p showed a high-intensity asymmetric C=C peak at 284.3 eV (Figure S5), indicating a high graphitic nature and good electrical conductivity of the carbon frame-

work. Other N-OMC samples with longer mesochannels also gave similar C1s spectra with a high intensity asymmetric C=C peak.

Cyclic voltammetry (CV) profiles of N-OMC catalysts and undoped OMC-p in oxygen-saturated 0.1 M KOH solution at a scan rate of 50 mV s<sup>-1</sup> are shown in Figure S6. All of the N-OMC catalysts show a well-resolved ORR polarisation current in the potential range between -0.1 and -0.3 V (vs. Ag/AgCl). Notably, even undoped platelet OMC-p with thin disk morphology demonstrates ORR activity in alkaline electrolyte with a potential maximum at -0.26 V, albeit lower than of the other N-OMC samples. This may be attributed to the excellent surface properties of undoped OMC-p such as high surface area and pore volume, which generate large numbers of exposed defects and graphitic edge planes for adsorption of oxygen. [13] Another reason may be the presence of ORR-active guinones on the surfaces of the OMC. Alexeyeva et al. and Tammeveski et al. proposed that semiquinone radical anions (Q<sup>--</sup>) take part in oxygen reduction in alkaline electrolyte.[14] Compared to undoped OMC-p, all of the N-OMCs have considerably positiveshifted ORR potential maxima, clearly indicating that the presence of nitrogen in the OMC framework plays a significant role in ORR activity. Among them, the N-OMC-p catalyst shows the best ORR potential maxima at -0.16 V. Kong et al. reported similar ORR activities in iron-coordinated N-OMC catalysts.<sup>[15]</sup> Notably, however, contrary to their iron-coordinated N-OMC catalysts, our N-OMC catalysts does not contain iron in the carbon framework as proved by XPS, XRD and EDS measurements (Figure S4).

Recently, we have compared the electrocatalytic ORR activity of nitrogen-doped OMC synthesised from iron phthalocyanine with that synthesised from iron-free phthalocyanine and found that the former has almost 100 mV higher onset and half-wave potentials.<sup>[16]</sup> The N-OMC synthesised from iron phthalocyanine did not possess iron in the carbon framework because it was removed during etching, as in this work. The presence or absence of the iron species had negligible effect on ORR activity. Therefore, it can be assumed that although iron species are not a part of active sites for the ORR, they must have a definite role in the formation of highly active catalysts, increasing the ORR activity. One possible role of iron species may originate from the iron phthalocyanine precursor, which contains one iron atom linked to four pyrrolic nitrogen atoms. Removal of iron by hydrogen fluoride etching can expose the more active nitrogen on the N-OMC surface, which assists the ORR catalysis.[8b] Due the additional electron in the nitrogen valence orbital compared to that of carbon, there is an increase in the total number of electrons in the system, which can in turn increase the Fermi level at the donor state and reduce the electronic band gap.[17] This change can provide nitrogen-doped carbon with metallic character, resulting in high catalytic activity.<sup>[18]</sup> Yasuda et al. and Stöhr et al. reported that both pyridinic and graphitic nitrogen contribute to a positive shift in onset potential compared to undoped carbon.<sup>[19]</sup> On the other hand, a four-electron transfer is favoured by the presence of pyrrolic and pyridinic nitrogen, which induces a localised distribution of unpaired electrons in the graphitic edge sites readily available for donation to adsorbed dioxygen molecules and, thus, can reduce the activation energy for reduction. [19] Another significant advantage of using an iron complex as the carbon precursor is the substantial increase in graphitic phase in the synthesised turbostratic carbon. The XRD pattern in Figure S4b shows an intense (002) diffraction peak at  $2\theta = 27^{\circ}$ , indicating an increased amount of graphitic phase. This phenomenon can dramatically increase the electrical conductivity and thereby facilitate the electron transfer process.[16] Another interesting observation can be drawn from the XRD spectrum of N-OMC-p catalyst before hydrogen fluoride etching (Figure S4b) in that it contains some crystal phases other than turbostratic carbon. These have been reported to originate from a mixture of Fe-C, Fe-N and Fe-O bonding. [20] Removal of iron from the carbon matrix by hydrogen fluoride etching releases some active surface sites, which may be another factor behind the outstanding ORR kinetics. Thus, although iron is required for the preparation of highly active nitrogen-doped ORR carbon catalyst, its physical presence is not necessary for the nitrogendoped carbon catalyst to be active in the ORR in either alkaline or acidic media.

To understand the kinetics and mechanism of the ORR at our carbonaceous electrocatalysts, we performed linear scan voltammetry (LSV) measurements at different rotation speeds by using a rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE). As shown in Figure 2a, all of the N-OMC catalysts exhibited ORR onset poten-

tials in the vicinity of that shown by commercial Pt/C (20 wt.%) catalyst. ORR performance parameters of all the OMC catalysts and commercial 20 wt.% Pt/C in alkaline electrolyte are summarised in Table S2. In particular, of the catalysts synthesised, N-OMC-p showed the best onset potential, which was 10 mV more positive than that of commercial Pt/C under

the alkaline conditions. In addition, the N-OMC-p revealed a half-wave potential 50 mV more positive than that of the commercial state-of-the-art Pt/C. As nitrogen content and the nature of N¢C bonding are similar in all of the N-OMC catalysts, the variation in ORR activities can be directly correlated to the variation in textural properties. The N-OMC-p with a platelet-like thin disk shape has the highest surface area, which ensures the greatest electrochemically active surface area for oxygen adsorption and, thus, the best ORR activity. The increase in mesopore channel length from N-OMC-p to N-OMC-l results in a decrease in specific surface area and, thus, a decrease in the electrochemically active surface area. In line with this, the ORR onset potential downshifts to a more negative potential from N-OMC-p to N-OMC-l. In addition, the N-OMC-p with short mesochannels allows much less mass transfer resistance and thus demonstrates better electrocatalytic performance compared to N-OMCs with longer mesochannels.

In Figure 2a, the current density achieved for N-OMC-p at ¢0.3 V (which falls under diffusion controlled region) is shown to be ¢7.63 mAcm¢<sup>2</sup> , which is higher than the ¢6.05 mAcm¢<sup>2</sup> of the commercial Pt/C catalyst. The current density decreases in order of increasing mesopore channel length, that is, N-OMC-p>N-OMC-s>N-OMC-m>N-OMC-l. The high current density in N-OMC-p is attributed to the presence of short and uniform mesoporous channels, which allow unhindered mass transfer, thus the reaction rate of oxygen reduction in N-OMC-p is expected to be faster than in the other N-OMC samples. With increasing mesoporous channel length from N-OMC-p to N-OMC-l, it is expected that the mass transfer resistance increases and, therefore, that the ORR rate decreases as observed in the gradual decrease in current density yield.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was performed to check the charge transfer resistance at the electrode–electrolyte interface of the N-OMCs and undoped OMC. The Nyquist plots obtained in Figure S7 were fitted by using the ZFit program to calculate the charge transfer resistance. It was observed that all of the N-OMCs had less charge transfer resistance than undoped OMC-p, which could be attributed to a higher electrical conductivity of the N-OMCs. Low or mediate doping of nitrogen can significantly increase the electrical conductivity in nitrogen-doped mesoporous carbons, which is ultimately favourable for electron transfer during the ORR.[21,22] On the other hand, N-OMC-p, which poses the least structural hindrance of the N-OMCs studied here, was found to have a charge transfer resistance of 3.33 W, less than that of N-OMC-s (4.43 W) and much less than of N-OMC-m (7.84 W) and N-OMC-l (9.14 W), in agreement with our expectation that resistance increases with mesochannel length.

ORR can proceed through two different pathways: either a direct four-electron pathway towards formation of OH¢ or a two-electron two-step pathway that involves the formation of intermediate HO<sup>2</sup> ions firstly by a two-electron reduction, then reduction to OH¢ by a second two-electron pathway. Formation of HO<sup>2</sup> ions is not only an obstacle to high current output but also poisonous to the ORR system as it can corrode the catalyst surface and membrane separator and eventually result in a negative effect on long-term stability. [18a] The selectivity of the four-electron reduction of oxygen in our catalysts was studied by using the RRDE technique. The potential of the platinum ring electrode in the RRDE system was set at 0.5 V for detecting peroxide species formed at the disc electrode. As shown in Figure 2c, the measured percentage of HO<sup>2</sup> ions was a mere 3.64% for the N-OMC-p catalyst at a potential of ¢0.5 V, which was similar to that of the commercial 20 wt.% Pt/C catalyst (2.42%), whereas those for N-OMC-s, N-OMC-m, N-OMC-l, and undoped OMC-p were 4.21, 5.34, 9.56, and 28.20%, respectively. Moreover, the HO<sup>2</sup> yield was found to be steady over the whole potential window, and thus a high and reliable performance could be expected from all of the N-OMC catalysts, including N-OMC-p, similar to that of commercial Pt/C. Bare OMC-p generated a high amount of HO<sup>2</sup> ¢ ions due to the absence of active nitrogen sites, which indicated an indirect two-step pathway for the ORR.

As revealed in Figure 2d, the electron transfer number remains within the range of 3.6 to 4.0 in the potential window from ¢0.2 to ¢0.8 V for all of the N-OMC samples. The measured values of the electron transfer number at ¢0.5 V (diffusion controlled region) for N-OMC-p, N-OMC-s, N-OMC-m and N-OMC-l are 3.85, 3.81, 3.77 and 3.60, respectively, showing an almost four-electron direct pathway to form OH¢ . These results indicate the tremendous potential of our catalyst as a cheap and efficient alternative to expensive Pt/C. Compared with the N-OMCs, the undoped OMC-p shows high HO<sup>2</sup> ¢ yield and a low electron transfer number of approximately 3 due to the absence of nitrogen species on the carbon framework. In addition, there is a difference in ORR activity across the N-OMC samples, with the shorter mesopore channel length resulting in the best ORR activity. This clearly implies that not only nitrogen content but also textural properties such as surface area and pore structure also play important roles in the catalysis of the ORR. Comprehensive ORR activity data for all of the catalysts in alkaline electrolyte are included in Table S2.

Methanol crossover from anode to cathode is a serious problem in direct methanol fuel cells, in which methanol oxidation in the cathode overtakes the ORR and poisons the cathode catalyst.[18a] To check for this, methanol (5.0 mL) was injected into oxygen-saturated 0.1m potassium hydroxide electrolyte during chronoamperometric (CA) analysis of N-OMC-p and Pt/C catalysts at ¢0.3 V. As shown in Figure 3 a, methanol oxidation did not take place during the ORR process with the N-OMC-p catalyst, whereas a strong oxidation current was detected in Pt/C. This clearly indicated the high selectivity of our material as a methanol-tolerant cathode catalyst in the ORR compared to commercial Pt/C. Further analysis was performed to test the long-term stability of our catalyst by CA analysis. The relative CA responses of N-OMC-p and Pt/C electrodes at ¢0.3 V vs. Ag/AgCl in oxygen-saturated 0.1m potassium hydroxide solution over time are shown in Figure 3 b. N-OMC-p revealed excellent stability under the tested conditions, retaining approximately 76.8% of its initial current density after 15 h, whereas the current density of the Pt/C catalyst dropped to 19.7%. On the basis of a strong covalent bonding interaction of the nitrogen atom with the carbon framework, unlike the physical deposition of platinum nanoparticles on the carbon

framework, the nitrogen-doped active catalyst surfaces are much less degradable. Moreover, good homogeneity of the C—N bonding throughout the carbon framework enables the effective replacement of the catalyst surface, which is supposed to be otherwise destroyed on continuous operation. In contrast, dissolution of platinum during operation decreases the effective catalyst surface and eventually leads to a decrease in the output current.

After observing the outstanding performance of N-OMC catalysts in alkaline media, we tested them in more competitive acidic media. The CV profiles of N-OMC-p, N-OMC-s, N-OMC-m and N-OMC-I for the ORR in oxygen-saturated 0.5 м HClO₄ electrolyte are shown in Figure 4a. The N-OMC samples had a significant ORR polarisation wave in acidic media and potential maxima at 0.37, 0.35, 0.27 and 0.21 V, respectively. Undoped OMC-p showed almost no ORR activity under acidic conditions, unlike under alkaline conditions, as shown in Figures 2a and S6, again proving the importance of nitrogen doping. To gain more understanding of the electrocatalytic activity of the N-OMC catalysts during the ORR process under acidic conditions, we recorded LSV curves by using a RRDE in 0.5 M HClO₄ electrolyte at a rotation speed of 1600 rpm with a scan rate of 10 mV s<sup>-1</sup> and compared their electrocatalytic ORR activities with that of commercial Pt/C. N-OMC-p, N-OMC-s, N-OMC-m, N-OMC-I, and Pt/C (20%) showed ORR onset potentials of 0.60,

0.55, 0.53, 0.48, and 0.64 V, respectively. The onset potential for the N-OMC-p was now different to that of the commercial Pt/C catalyst by only 40 mV. The N-OMC-p also revealed a half-wave potential only 50 mV from that of the state-of-the-art Pt/C, which was a tremendous achievement for non-precious metal catalysts developed to date. N-OMC-p, N-OMC-s, N-OMC-m, N-OMC-I, and Pt/C also revealed limiting current densities at 0.3 V of -6.29, -5.10, -4.63, -3.18, and -7.26 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, respectively (see Table S3). Moreover, as shown in Figure S8, the N-OMC-p showed excellent methanol tolerance in both acidic and alkaline electrolyte. The onset potential and half-wave potential of the N-OMC catalysts compared to commercial Pt/C under both alkaline and acidic conditions are shown in Figure 5. This demonstrates the outstanding performance of our non-precious metal catalyst in both alkaline and acidic media and such a high level of catalytic activity comparable to that of Pt/C has generally only been observed in highly efficient Fe-N-C-type electrocatalysts with well-coordinated iron, nitrogen and carbon complex structures. [23] In addition, the ORR activity of N-OMC catalysts is less in acidic medium than in alkaline medium in contrast to commercial Pt/C. This may be due in part to the deactivation of semiguinone species and/or the pyridinic nitrogen group in the acidic environment by the protonation reaction.[14a,24]

Percentage  $\rm H_2O_2$  formation and the number of electrons transferred in the ORR process in acidic medium are shown in Figure 4c and d. All of our synthesised catalysts show an electron transfer number of more than 3.8 over the complete potential range, especially N-OMC-p, which shows the best value of 3.93 at 0.3 V.  $\rm H_2O_2$  formation is also limited to less than 6% for all of the catalysts and N-OMC-p comes up best here too with a mere 3.93%. These data further prove the fast kinetics and high selectivity of our catalysts for electrocatalytic oxygen reduction under both alkaline and acidic conditions.

Recently, Cheon et al. demonstrated similar results with an iron-cobalt-coordinated ordered mesoporous porphyrinic carbon catalyst.[23] They propose that in addition to high catalyst surface area, which enlarges C¢N active sites, M¢N bonding also helps to facilitate oxygen adsorption and reduction. However, as our N-OMC catalysts possess no appreciable iron species as evidenced by XPS, EDS and XRD measurements (Figure S4), it can be projected that the optimum nitrogen doping, high electrical conductivity and excellent textural properties of our N-OMCs are solely responsible for their high ORR activity, also in acidic medium. Similar results have also been reported by Kobayashi et al. for cobalt phthalocyanine-based carbon and by Liu et al. for cobalt, iron-ethylenediamine-chelate complex-based carbon cathode catalysts,[8a,c] supporting the idea that the residual metal atoms and oxidised metal are not part of the catalytically active sites for the ORR in the metal-nitrogen-doped carbon cathode. Some of the reported onset potentials for ORR under alkaline and/or acidic conditions for nitrogen-doped carbon materials synthesised by using iron-coordinated precursors are summarised in Table S4. Most of the reported works contain iron as the active species in the carbon framework, unlike our catalysts. Despite the absence of iron from the carbon framework, our N-OMC-p illustrates one of the best ORR performances in both alkaline and acidic media compared to other metal-containing nitrogen-doped carbon materials. Thus, this work clearly evidences that metallic iron species are not a part of the catalytically active sites for ORR but rather facilitate the formation of active surfaces and the electron transfer process by increasing electrical conductivity. Therefore, it is highly likely that the physical presence of iron in the carbon precursor is necessary for the synthesis of active heteroatom-doped carbon catalysts with high ORR activity but iron is not an active component of those catalysts. This remarkable level of performance in our catalysts, especially N-OMC-p, compared to the state-of-the-art commercial Pt/C catalyst, demonstrates that excellent electrocatalytic activity can be achieved also with non-precious or even metal-free heteroatom-doped carbon catalysts by innovative and careful control of surface and structural characteristics and the dopant content of the carbon framework.

### Conclusions

We have demonstrated that a synergistic contribution is needed from both textural properties and nitrogen doping to achieve high electrocatalytic activity in non-precious metal catalysts. To prove this synergy, we have synthesised nitrogendoped ordered mesoporous carbons (N-OMCs) with four different mesopore channel lengths by pyrolysis of iron phthalocyanine-infiltrated SBA-15 silica templates with different morphologies. The electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) studies of the resulting N-OMCs were performed in both alkaline and acidic media and they all demonstrated excellent ORR activity with a nearly four-electron transfer process. The activity in alkaline media was nearly equal to or better than that of commercial platinum catalyst in terms of onset potential and diffusion-limited current density and, in acidic media, close to that of the commercial platinum catalyst. Surface-confined semiquinone anion radicals and/or the pyridinic nitrogen group may have played an additional role in the outstanding ORR activity in alkaline media, however, they were deactivated in acidic environments. The interesting discovery made in this work was the relation of iron species and textural properties to the electrocatalytic activity of heteroatom-doped carbon catalysts. Concerning the contribution of iron species, it was found that iron species were necessary for the synthesis of highly active heteroatom-doped carbon but were not an active component of the catalyst. The kinetics of the ORR reaction were found to increase gradually with decreasing mesopore channel length in N-OMC samples with similar nitrogen content. This behaviour was related to resistance in the movement of reactants towards active sites, which increased with increasing mesopore channel length. We believe that this work will open an important avenue for the design of catalysts by tailoring textural properties and the carbon precursor to overcome the activity barrier in ORR catalysis, especially under highly competitive acidic conditions.

### Experimental Section

Synthesis of ordered mesoporous silica SBA-15: Conventional ordered mesoporous rod-type SBA-15 silica materials with different mesochannel length were used as hard templates, prepared under hydrothermal conditions according to the established procedures.[25]

Synthesis of platelet-like SBA-15: Mesoporous platelet-shaped silica was synthesised according to a modified previously reported procedure.[12] Typically, Pluronic P123 triblock copolymer (1.0 g, M<sup>n</sup> 5800, Aldrich) was dissolved in 2.0m HCl aqueous solution (40 g)

by stirring for 3 h at  $35\,^{\circ}\text{C}$ . Once the solution became clear, tetraethyl orthosilicate (2.25 mL,  $98\,\%$ , Aldrich) and  $\text{ZrOCl}_2\cdot 8\,\text{H}_2\text{O}$  (0.161 g,  $99.5\,\%$ , Sigma–Aldrich) were added and the thus-formed colloidal suspension stirred at the same temperature for 24 h. The solution was then transferred to a Teflon vessel, which was sealed, and crystallised for a further 24 h at  $90\,^{\circ}\text{C}$  in an oven under static conditions. The white product was filtered, washed with deionised water and dried in an oven at  $80\,^{\circ}\text{C}$ . Prior to characterisation and guest inclusion experiments, the as-synthesised SBA-15 powder was calcined in air at  $550\,^{\circ}\text{C}$  for 12 h to remove the organic template from the pores.

Synthesis of N-OMC: Iron phthalocyanine (250 mg) and mesoporous SBA-15 (500 mg) were mixed homogeneously under dry conditions for 30 min by using a vortex mixer. The homogeneously mixed composite obtained was pyrolysed in two steps at a constant Ar flow rate of 100 mL min<sup>-1</sup>: first at 350 °C for 3 h, then at 900 °C for 5 h. The first aging step at 350 °C was necessary for efficient infiltration and polymerisation of iron phthalocyanine in the pores of SBA-15 before high temperature calcination. The resultant N-OMC materials were obtained by etching out the silica and iron species with HF solution and repeated washing with deionised water. The synthesised materials were labelled as N-OMC-p, N-OMC-s, N-OMC-m and N-OMC-I according to SBA-15 shape and channel length (p=platelet-type and s=rugby ball-type ellipsoidal morphologies; m=medium length and I=long-rod mesochannels).

Characterisation: The surface morphologies of the N-OMC materials were examined by using FE-SEM (Hitachi S-4700, acceleration voltages of 10kV) and UHR-SEM (Hitachi S-5500, acceleration voltages of 30kV) and UHR-TEM (JEOL FE-2010 microscope operated at 200 kV). To confirm the uniformity of the ordered mesopores, XRD patterns were recorded on a Rigaku Smartlab X-ray diffractometer with CuK<sub>a</sub> radiation, operating at 30 mA and 40 kV and fitted with a diffracted beam monochromator. Surface area and pore characteristics were characterised by recording N<sub>2</sub> sorption isotherms at -196 °C on a Micromeritics ASAP-2020 accelerated surface area and porosimetry system. Specific surface areas of the samples were determined by analysis of N<sub>2</sub> adsorption data in the relative pressure range 0.05-0.2 by using the BET equation. Total pore volumes were determined from the amount of gas adsorbed at the relative pressure of 0.99. Pore size distributions were calculated from the adsorption branches by using the BJH method. Elemental compositions and bonding properties were analysed on an X-ray photoelectron spectroscope (ESCALAB 250 XPS system with a monochromated Al K<sub>a</sub> X-ray source).

Electrochemical measurements: All of the electrochemical analyses were performed at RT in a conventional three-electrode arrangement with a RRDE connected to an electrochemical analyser (BioLogic VMP3). A glassy carbon RRDE coated with as-synthesised N-OMC or commercial Vulcan XC-72R-supported Pt catalyst was used as the working electrode, with Ag/AgCl with saturated KCl solution and Pt wire as the reference and counter electrodes, respectively. All potentials were measured and reported vs. the Ag/AgCl (with saturated KCl solution) reference electrode. The catalyst ink was prepared by dispersing the catalyst (5.0 mg) in a mixture of 5.0% Nafion solution (0.1 mL) and deionised water (0.9 mL). The dispersed ink was drop-casted over the glassy carbon RRDE and dried at 80  $^{\circ}\text{C}$  in an oven. The CV curves were recorded in  $\text{O}_2\text{-satu-}$ rated 0.1  $\rm M$  KOH or 0.5  $\rm M$  HClO $_4$  solution for the ORR with a scan rate of 50 mV s<sup>-1</sup> in the potential range +0.5 to -1.0 V in alkaline medium or +1.1 to -0.2 V in acidic medium, respectively. Before recording, the working electrodes were cycled 20 times for stabili-

sation of the current density. RRDE measurements were performed by recording LSV measurements in the  $O_2$ -saturated  $0.1\,\mathrm{m}$  KOH or  $0.5\,\mathrm{m}$  HClO $_4$  solutions. The ORR LSV curves were recorded between +0.2 and  $-1.0\,\mathrm{V}$  in alkaline medium or +1.0 and  $-0.2\,\mathrm{V}$  in acidic medium at a potential scan rate of  $10\,\mathrm{mV}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ , whereas the Pt ring potential was measured at a set potential of  $+0.5\,\mathrm{V}$ . The electron transfer number (n) and  $\mathrm{HO_2}^-$  percentage formation were calculated by using equations (1) and (2):

$$n = \frac{4I_{\rm D}}{I_{\rm D} + I_{\rm R}/N} \tag{1}$$

$$HO_2^- (\%) = 200 \times \frac{I_R/N}{I_D + I_R/N}$$
 (2)

in which  $I_{\rm D}$ ,  $I_{\rm R}$  and  $N\!=\!0.424$  are the disk current, ring current and collection efficiency, respectively, of the RRDE employed. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was recorded in 0.1 m KOH at -0.3 V between 10 kHz and 100 mHz with a sinusoidal voltage perturbation of  $\pm$  10 mV.

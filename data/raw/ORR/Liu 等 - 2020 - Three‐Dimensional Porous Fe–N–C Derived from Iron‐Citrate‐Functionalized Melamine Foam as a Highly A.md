Keywords: oxygen reduction reaction, carbon-based material, non-Pt electrocatalyst, Zn-air battery The development of highly active and stable electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is of crucial importance for the application of Zn-air batteries. Herein, a facile method to prepare Fe-N-C catalysts with three-dimensional (3D) porous structure is reported, where melamine foam is used as the self-sacrificed template, citric acid and iron salts are employed as the precursors. The morphology and chemical valence state of the surface elements of the catalyst are characterized. Cyclic voltammetry (CV), liner scanning voltammetry (LSV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) are employed to evaluate the catalytic performance on the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The catalyst CA-Fe/MF-N900 (calcinated at 900°C) exhibits the best ORR performance. In alkaline electrolyte, the ORR current starts at 0.98V vs. RHE. The half-wave potential ( $E_{1/2}$ ) is 0.83V vs. RHE, and the limiting current density reaches 5.3 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. After 1000 cycles, E<sub>1/2</sub> merely shifts negatively by 7 mV. The Zn-air battery fabricated with the CA-Fe/MF-N900 as the cathode catalyst displays outstanding discharging performance with the peak power density of 158 mW cm<sup>-2</sup> and long-term stability. The enhanced catalytic activity could be attributed to the advanced 3D interconnected porous architecture of the Fe-N-C catalyst, which can not only accommodate abundant active sites but also significantly reduce the mass/charge transfer resistance. This work provides a novel preparation route of three-dimensional continuously porous composites for energy storage and conversion.

#### 1. Introduction

In recent decades, owing to the depletion of the fossil sources, a series of global issues, i.e., energy crisis, environmental pollution, gradually stand out. Developing alternative renewable clean energy is highly desirable. Among the various energy storage and conversion devices, Zn-air batteries have drawn extensive attention, attributing to its high theoretical energy density (ca. 1353 Wh kg<sup>-1</sup>), long shelf-life and abundance of zinc on earth.<sup>[1]</sup> Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is the cathodic reaction of Zn-air batteries, which is kinetically sluggish.<sup>[2]</sup> Development of highly active and stable ORR electrocatalyst is crucial to improve the performance of the Zn-air batteries.<sup>[3]</sup>

Plenty of studies were focused on the development of low cost electrocatalysts, such as transitional metal and metal oxides, metal-free carbon-based material, and metal/nitrogen doped carbon (M/N/C).<sup>[4]</sup> Among them, owing to the excellent catalytic activity, M/N/C have attracted lots of attention.<sup>[5]</sup> The preparation procedure of M/N/C catalysts usually includes carbonization of the metal precursor, nitrogen sources and carbon sources at 800-1000°C, thus, most of the obtained catalysts were characterized by inadequate porous structure and low surface area, resulting to low activity and poor mass transfer. Currently, several strategies are emerged to the precision synthesis of M/N/C catalysts with 3D porous structure. For example, hard templates such as MOFs, molecular sieves, MgO and SiO<sub>2</sub> were often employed in the synthesis process, which generate porous structures after removal.<sup>[6]</sup> Nevertheless, the template synthesis route is complicated and costly. Therefore, it is imperative to establish a facile, low-cost process to synthesize M/N/C catalysts with advanced architectures being able to support sufficient active sites as well as facilitate mass/charge transfer.

Melamine foam (MF), is a foam-like material consisting of formaldehyde-melamine-sodium bisulfite copolymer, which has attracted intensive attention as a scaffold for material synthesis due to its unique 3D interconnected architecture.<sup>[7]</sup> After carbonized, the 3D interconnected porous structure could be well retained in the derived carbon sponge. However, its activity for the ORR is

poor without incorporation of metal ions. In a recent work, melamine-derived graphitic tubes have been employed as the support to synthesize single Pt atom electrocatalyst, which exhibits high activity towards hydrogen evolution reaction. Herein, we reported a facile, low-cost approach to prepare 3D porous Fe-N-C catalysts with MF as the self-sacrificed template, citric acid and iron(III) chloride as the precursors. Fe ions were chelated with citric acid, avoiding the agglomeration of Fe particles during the pyrolysis. Remarkably, this 3D porous architecture of carbon sponge derived from MF could provide abundant active sites, accelerate the mass transportation through the porous structure, and promote electrons transfer along the interconnected carbon skeletons. Overall, this 3D porous Fe-N-C catalyst exhibits excellent catalytic activity and durability for the application in Znair batteries.

#### 2. Results and discussion

### 2.1. Evaluation of the ORR activity and stability

The effects of pyrolysis temperature during the catalyst preparation on the ORR activity were investigated. Linear scanning voltammetric (LSV) curves for catalysts prepared by different pyrolysis temperatures were presented in **Figure 1a**. It shows that, the ORR half-wave potential ( $E_{1/2}$ ) increases from 0.80 to 0.83 V as the pyrolysis temperature improves from 700 to 900°C. With an increasing temperature up to 1000°C, the  $E_{1/2}$  decreases by 52 mV. Thereby, the optimized pyrolysis temperature is 900°C. MF-N900 and Fe/MF-N900 were prepared for investigation on the roles of Fe and CA on the catalytic activity for the ORR. A 20% Pt/C catalyst bought from Johnsen Matthey Co. was used as the benchmark. As shown in Figure 1b, the catalytic activity for the ORR decreases in the sequence of CA-Fe/MF-N900 > Fe/MF-N900 > MF-N900. Compared to MF-N900, the activity of Fe/MF-N900 was significantly improved in the aspect of both the positive onset potential (0.98 V) and the  $E_{1/2}$  (0.80 V), indicating that Fe is indispensable for the formation of high active sites. With the help of citric acid in the

preparation process, CA-Fe/MF-N900 displays better activity with 30 mV positive shift in  $E_{1/2}$  than Fe/MF-N900, probably ascribing to the chelating effect of the citric acid with Fe, but worse activity with 50 mV negative shift in  $E_{1/2}$ , comparing to the commercial 20%Pt/C.

To gain more insight into the reaction pathway of ORR over these catalysts, the electron transfer number (n) of ORR were calculated based on the polarization curves at different rotating rates of the electrode recorded in **Figure 1c-1e**. The derived K-L plots are shown **in Figure 1f** by plotting  $i_{lim}$  against different rotating rates referred to the K-L equation. <sup>[9]</sup> The calculated n for MF-N900, Fe/MF-N900 and CA-Fe/MF-N900 were 2.8, 4.0 and 3.8, revealing the incorporation of Fe and CA into the catalysts promotes a  $4e^-$  transfer pathway for ORR. The activity of CA-Fe/MF-N900 for the ORR in the acidic electrolyte were also tested, where the corresponding polarization curves were shown in **Figure S1a**. A 5%Pt/C catalyst was employed as the benchmark. It can be seen that the  $E_{1/2}$  of CA-Fe/MF-N900 is 193 mV negative than that

of 5%Pt/C. The calculated n of the ORR in 0.1M HClO<sub>4</sub> from the ORR polarization curves in Figure S1b is 4.0. The derived K-L plots are also shown in the inset of **Figure S1b**. CA-Fe/MF-N900 catalyst exhibits an apparent 4e<sup>-</sup> pathway for the ORR.

To evaluate the stability under ORR conditions, the catalysts were subjected to continues cycling between 0.6-1.0 V in the oxygen saturated 0.1 M NaOH electrolyte. **Figure 2** shows the ORR polarization curves before and after 1000 cycles. It can be seen that, the  $E_{1/2}$  of MF-N900 and CA-Fe/MF-N900 towards ORR shifts negatively by 19 mV and 7 mV after aging, suggesting a better stability of CA-Fe/MF-N900. The results confirm the positive effect on the catalyst stability by introducing Fe and CA to MF during the preparation process. The metal component was futher replaced by cobalt for the attempt to tune the electronic structure and activity of the catalyst. [10] As shown in **Figure S2**, the optimized CA-Co/MF-N900 catalyst exhibits comparable ORR activity and stability with CA-Fe/MF-N900.

#### 2.2. The origin for the improved ORR activity of the catalysts

Firstly, the scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) images of MF, MF-900 and CA-MF/Fe-N900 are shown in **Figure 3**. MF is of tetrapod porous structure. After calcinated at 900°C, the tetrapods retain the morphology but are of hollow structures, which is possibly the combined effect of the Kirkendall effect and the gas escaping pathway left during the heat-treatment. In **Figure 3c** and **3d**, the CA-MF/Fe-N900 inherits the tetrapod architectures of the precursor MF, however, with a This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved

roughened fluffy surface. Moreover, the elemental mapping analysis of the CA-MF/Fe-N900 (**Figure 3e-3i**) discloses the uniform distribution of C, N, O, and Fe in the catalyst.

The composition and chemical state of elements on the catalyst surface were further studied by X-ray photo-electron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. The XPS survey spectrum and the elemental composition of MF/Fe-N900 and CA-Fe/MF-N900 are displayed in **Figure S3**. The XPS peaks apex at 284.6 eV, 400.6 eV, 532.0 eV and 709.0 eV were assigned as C1s, N1s, O1s and Fe2p, respectively. The N contents in MF/Fe-N900 and CA-Fe/MF-N900 are similar, which is 1.89% and 1.83%, respectively. **Figure 4a** exhibits the high resolution N 1s XPS spectra for the catalysts. For MF/Fe-N900, the N 1s spectrum contains five peaks, belonging to pyridinic N (398.5 eV), pyrrolic N (399.8eV), graphitic N (400.8-400.9 eV) and N-O (402-402.3 eV) and N=O (403.9-404 eV), respectively. The binding energy of N 1s XPS spectra for CA-Fe/MF-N900 located at 398.5 eV, 399.1 eV, 400.8 eV, 400.9 eV and 402.2 eV are ascribed to pyridinic N, Fe-N<sub>x</sub>, graphitic N, N-O and N=O. For clear comparison, the histogram of the surface content of various nitrogen are also presented in **Figure 5**. Pyridinic N, Fe-N<sub>x</sub>, pyrrolic N, graphitic N and oxidized N are denoted as N1, N2, N3, N4 and N5.

In comparison with MF/Fe-N900, the proportion of pyridinic N, Fe-N<sub>x</sub> and graphitic N in CA-Fe/MF-N900 are higher. It has been widely accepted that the pyridinic N as well as the Fe-N<sub>x</sub> are the most active species in catalyzing the ORR. [11] Additionally, graphitic N is reported to show synergistic effect by facilitating the O<sub>2</sub> adsorption and O-O bond splitting.<sup>[12]</sup> As shown in **Figure** 4b the peak of Fe 2p XPS spectra of MF/Fe-N900 and CA- Fe/MF-N900 located at 707.4 -707.5 eV is attributed to Fe- $N_x$ , confirming the presence of Fe- $N_x$  species.

**Figure 5**. The composition of different type of N on surface of the samples.

The peaks located at 708.7-711 eV are assigned to the Fe oxides. It can be seen that the  $Fe-N_x$  content in CA-Fe/MF-N900 is higher than that in MF/Fe-N900, suggesting the incorporation of CA facilitates the formation of Fe-N<sub>x</sub> species.

The double layer capacity (DLC) of carbon-based electrocatalysts was applied to evaluate electrochemical surface area (ECSA). CVs at different scanning rates, i.e., 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved

80, 90 and 100 mVs<sup>-1</sup>, were measured in the 0.1M NaOH electrolyte between 0.10-1.20 V where containing only non-faradic currents and the CV profiles are plotted in **Figure 6a-6c**. By linearly fitting the scanning rates versus current densities at 0.8 V *vs.* RHE in **Figure 6d**, the ECSA of catalysts are obtained. Based on the slope of the obtained fitting lines, the ECSA of MF-N900, MF/Fe-N900 and CA-Fe/MF-N900 are calculated to be 58.5 m<sup>2</sup>g<sup>-1</sup>, 43 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup> and 86.5 m<sup>2</sup>g<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. Noticed that CA-Fe/MF-N900 shows the highest ECSA, thus the highest catalytic activity. It is reasonable that the catalyst with high ECSA facilitate exposing abundant active catalytic sites and therefore the ORR process can be accelerated.

**Figure 7**. Comparison of Nyquist plots recorded at 0.8 V (a); fitting of Nyquist plots of the MF-N900 (b), MF/Fe-N900 (c) and CA-Fe/MF-N900 (d). Inset of b is the equivalent circuit used to model the EIS data, consisting of a series resistance (Rs), two constant phase elements (CPE1 and CPE2), resistance related to surface porosity (RP), and charge transfer resistance related to ORR process (Rct).

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis is carried out in order to provide information on the charge transfer resistance during the electrocatalytic process. The Nyquist plots of MF-N900, MF/Fe-N900 and CA-Fe/MF-N900 are plotted and fitted in **Figure 7**. Indicated by these results, the charge transfer resistance reduces as following, MF-N900 (1566  $\Omega$ ) < MF/Fe-N900 (800  $\Omega$ ) < CA-Fe/MF-N900 (345  $\Omega$ ). It can be observed that the charge-transfer resistance decreases with the enhancement in the ORR activity. This low charge transfer resistance of CA-Fe/MF-N900 could be ascribed to the continuously porous carbon network ensuring both the rapid electron transfer along the conductive carbon network and the fast mass transfer through the hierarchical pores.

To further identify if iron is involved in the active site, SCN<sup>-</sup> as a coordination agent was introduced to the electrolyte to investigate whether CA-Fe/MF-N900 is poisoned. In **Figure 8**, the ORR activity of CA-Fe/MF-N900 degrades in the presence of SCN<sup>-</sup> by 15 mV negative shift of half-wave potential. The electrode was then subjected to rinsing and retested in a fresh electrolyte. The ORR activity was observed to be recovered with the half-wave potential positively shifted by 10 mV comparing to that measured in presence of SCN<sup>-</sup>, which indicates that iron is perhaps to be consisted partial of the active catalytic sites.

To evaluate the catalyst performance under real working conditions, a Zn-air battery with the CA-Fe/MF-N900 catalyst as cathode was assembled and tested. **Figure 9** shows the discharging curves and the long-term stability test at a constant discharging current density of 5 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. An open-circuit voltage of 1.60 V was obtained. The peak power density could reach 158 mW cm<sup>-2</sup>, which is superior over most of the non-noble metal cathodic Zn-air battery in literature. [4c, 13] The discharging curve remains stable during the 14 hour durability test, with the battery voltage loss of only 13 mV. The polarization curves after the durability tests displays an open-circuit voltage of 1.50 V and maintains as high peak power density as that initially tested. Futher extention of the durability test was performed at a discharging current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> for 12 h. The output voltage of the battery was recorded in **Figure S4**, which exhibits only 10 mV drop at the end of the test. The results demonstrate the CA-Fe/MF-N900 catalyst is promising in the Zn-air batteries.

### 3. Conclusion

In conclusion, an innovative facile, low-cost method for the preparation of 3D porous Fe-N-C catalysts (CA-Fe/MF-N900) was developed. CA-Fe/MF-N900 exhibits outstanding ORR activity as well as stability in the alkaline electrolyte. The ORR over the CA-Fe/MF-N900 starts as early as 0.98V vs. RHE and a half-wave potential 0.83V vs. RHE, the limiting current density reaches 5.3 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. After 1000 cycles, the half-wave potential only shifts negatively by 7 mV. The enhanced activity could be ascribed to the advanced 3D interconnected porous architecture of the Fe-N-C catalyst, which can not only accommodate abundant active sites but also significantly reduce the mass/charge transfer resistance. The outstanding performance and long-term stability of the Zn-air battery with the CA-Fe/MF-N900 catalyst holds great promise for its practical application.

### 4. Experimental Section

#### 4.1. Catalyst preparation

The synthetic route of Fe-N-C catalysts is presented in Figure 10. In brief, 50 mg of FeCl<sub>3</sub>·6H<sub>2</sub>O and 44 mg of citric acid (CA) were dissolved in 50 mL of deionized water and sonicated for 15 min.

Afterwards, a piece of MF (4cm×2cm×1cm) was put into the above solution. After soaking for 20 minutes, the Fe-citrate modified MF was dried in the oven at 100°C for 6h. Afterwards, the composite was subjected to pyrolyzing at different aimed temperature in N<sub>2</sub> gas for 2h. The obtained sample was labeled as CA-Fe/MF-NT (T=700, 800, 900, and 1000°C). Another two control samples, MF-N900 (only MF as the precursor), Fe/MF-N900 (MF and FeCl<sub>3</sub>•6H<sub>2</sub>O as the precursors) were also synthesized by the same procedure.

**Figure 10**. The preparation route of CA-Fe/MF-N900 sample.

#### 4.2. Physical/Chemical characterization

The morphology and the elemental distribution of the samples were characterized by scanning electronic microscopy (SEM, JSM-7800F) equipped with an energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) detector. The surface elemental composition and chemical statement were probed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis (Thermo ESCALAB XI+, Al  $k_{\alpha}$ ).

### 4.3. Electrochemical characterization

The electrochemical performance of the samples was evaluated by a CHI 604E potentiostat in a three electrode electrochemical cell. A graphite rod was employed as a counter electrode. The reference electrode was a Hg/HgO electrode in 0.1 M NaOH solution. The working electrode was made by coating thin film layer on a 5 mm diameter glass carbon (GC) disk. The catalyst ink was prepared by weighting 5 mg of the samples and then dispersing in 2 mL of 100% ethanol plus 30  $\mu$ L of 5 wt% Nafion® solution (DuPont, USA) in an ultrasonic bath for 10 min. After that, 20  $\mu$ L of aliquots was pipetted on the GC disk and dried naturally. A stable cyclic voltammogram (CV) curve

was recorded after surface clean by potential scanning between 0.10–1.20 V vs. RHE in a nitrogen saturated 0.1 M NaOH electrolyte. The scan rate was kept at 100 mV s<sup>-1</sup>. The electrochemical performance on the oxygen reduction reaction were performed in an oxygen saturated 0.1 M NaOH solution at a scanning rate of 10 mV s<sup>-1</sup>. The stability of the electrocatalysts was assessed by subjecting to continuous cycling for 1000 cycles between 0.60-1.00 V vs. RHE at a scanning rate of 100 mV s<sup>-1</sup>. All these potentials were referred to RHE.

### 4.4. Zn-air battery fabrication and testing

A home-made Zn-air battery was fabricated to evaluate the performance of the catalyst. A commercial Zn foil was used as the anode and the electrolyte is 6M KOH solution. The air electrode was made by pressing Ni foam, water-resistant carbon layer and catalyst layer together with a pressure of 80 kg cm<sup>-2</sup>, where the catalyst layer was made by spraying the uniform ink of CA-Fe/MF-N900, ethanol and 5 wt% Nafion<sup>®</sup> solution. The discharging curves were recorded on Neware battery testing system (5V, 6A). The durability was tested by maintaining a constant current of 5 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> for 14 hours. Afterwards, a discharging curve was recorded for comparison with initially. Afterwads, the battery was kept running at a discharging current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> for another 12 hours. The catalyst loading was 2.5 mg cm<sup>-2</sup>.

A facile route is proposed to construct an Fe-N-C composite with 3D porous structure, where melamine foam is used as the self-scarified template, citric acid and iron salts are employed as the precursors. The Zn-air battery fabricated with the CA-Fe/MF-N900 as the cathode catalyst displays outstanding discharging performance with the peak power density of 158 mW cm<sup>-2</sup> and long-term stability.

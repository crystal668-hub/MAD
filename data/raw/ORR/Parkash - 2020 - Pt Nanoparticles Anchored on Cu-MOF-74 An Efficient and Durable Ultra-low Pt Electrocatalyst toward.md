Catalysts for slow oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) are of great importance for long-term operation and wide application for the cathode of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). Herein, an efficient approach used for the rational synthesis of an effective ORR electrocatalyst by encapsulating Pt nanoparticles with ultra-low content (0.5, 1.0, 1.5 wt.% Pt) on the surface of a copper-based organic metal frame (Cu-MOF-74) and then carbonized at 900 °C, for the first time. The catalyst Pt<sub>1%</sub>/Cu/NC-900 from the series of prepared catalysts exhibits a highly efficient ORR activity with an onset potential ( $E_0$ ) 1.01 V vs RHE and half-wave potential ( $E_{1/2}$ ) 0.88 V vs RHE compare to commercial Pt/C ( $E_0$  0.96 V and  $E_{1/2}$  0.86 V vs RHE). It has also displayed excellent long-term stability in an alkaline solution. The Pt<sub>1%</sub>/Cu/NC-900 performance and stability are dramatically improved, which may be attributed to the interaction of Pt with Cu and carbon carriers. Such an architecture provides an efficient approach for direct application of MOFs to electrocatalysts. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time we have used bimetallic Pt-Cu catalysts with ultra-low Pt contents for the ORR in the alkaline solution with superior activity than commercial Pt/C.

As industrial technology developed rapidly, the energy crisis triggered the scarcity of chemical products. The use of renewable energies is seen as an effective alternative to fossil fuels, such as fuel cells. <sup>1–5</sup> The most important reaction in these applications is the oxygen reduction (ORR). <sup>6–8</sup> Pt/C is currently the most feasible ORR electrocatalyst since it can handle ORR with high initial potential along the four predicted electron paths. <sup>9–11</sup> However, its rarity, high cost, and poor durability seriously hinder its large-scale use. <sup>12–15</sup> A low-cost electrocatalyst is, therefore, very important to devise.

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are a special substance that has unique chemical and physical characteristics. 16-19 MOFs have been commonly used in the last few years in gas storage, separation, catalysis, sensors, drug delivery, etc. 20–22 The high specific surface area of MOFs can maximize active center density, and its unique chemical structure provides a tailor-made microenvironment for the regulated reactions in the pores.<sup>23–25</sup> Consequently, in recent years the use of MOFs in electrochemical reactions has become a new field of research.<sup>26–28</sup> However, a few papers were published directly in the field of electrocatalysis due to the low transport rate and poor conductivity of MOFs. 29-33 To solve these issues, people are committed to developing better MOF related electrode materials, such as metal oxides, metal nanoparticles, and porous carbon compounds. 34-38 This method will increase material conductivity efficiently and will generate active centers. 39–41 However, the metal nodes can be agglomerated conveniently.<sup>9,42</sup> The porous structure which restricts the catalytic reaction is destroyed during the heat treatment process. 12,43 Another way of increasing MOF's conductivity is by combining MOF with different conductive carbon materials (including porous carbon, carbon nanotubes, and graphene). 25,44 However, inhomogeneous dispersion of the second phase of carbon cannot effectively increase conductivity.<sup>8,45</sup> Consequently, full MOF coverage of the carbon content will also partly reduce MOF's active sites. The bottleneck of MOF electrocatalysis is still how the problem of low ion transport and poor MOF conductivity. 4,11,46The encapsulation of nanoparticles on the surface of MOF is a classic method. This design is useful in stabilizing the active catalytic center, enhancing conductivity, and shortening the duration of mass transfer. <sup>49–52</sup> Carbon nanoparticles, carbon metal oxide, and other technologies have been used extensively in lithium batteries, catalysis, and other areas. <sup>19,53,54</sup> The development of metal/MOF using hybrid materials with ultra-low content of noble metal has not been published. <sup>55–58</sup> The organic combination of MOFs and ultra-low noble metal content and the development of hybrid materials is therefore considered to be able to effectively resolve the short-comings of MOFs in the field of electrocatalysis.

The work focuses on the utilization of metal-organic framework (MOF) as a host matrix for immobilizing metal nanoparticles (MNPs) and the use of fabricated MNP@MOF composites as superior ORR catalysts. To the best of our knowledge, the possibility for the synthesis of CTAB-capped ultra-low Pt nanoparticles (0.5, 1.0, 1.5 wt.% Pt), successfully encapsulated in the pores of Cu-MOF-74 and pyrolyzed at 900 °C, was achieved for the first time. The catalyst Pt<sub>1%</sub>/Cu/NC-900 from the series of prepared catalysts exhibits a superior ORR activity with onset potential (Eo) 1.01 V vs RHE and half-wave potential (E<sub>1/2</sub>) 0.88 V vs RHE compare to commercial Pt/C (Eo 0.96 V and E<sub>1/2</sub> 0.86 V vs RHE). This work not only provides an effective way to develop novel catalysts for the ORR but also inspires us to construct highly efficient sustainable energy conversion devices.

#### **Experimental**

Synthesis of Pt nanoparticles.—Typically, hexadecyltrimethy-lammonium bromide (CTAB) (66.6 mg), and chloroplatinic acid hexahydrate (H<sub>2</sub>PtCl<sub>6</sub>.6H<sub>2</sub>O, 0.03 mg) were mixed in methanol (20 ml) and then refluxed for 3 h. The samples were washed with methanol, vacuum-dried for 12 h at 60 °C, and distributed into 25 ml of methanol to form a stable colloid solution.

**Synthesis of the Cu-MOF-74.**—Typical, Cu(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>·3H<sub>2</sub>O) (3.0 g) and 2,5-dihydroxyterphthalic acid (0.75 g) was dissolved in 40 ml methanol. Move the mixture to a sealed autoclave and hold for 18 h at 100 °C. The reaction vessel is then removed and refrigerated

from the oven. The particles were centrifuged, washed several times with methanol, and then vacuum-dried for 12 h at 60 °C.

Synthesis of the Pt/Cu-MOF-74.—For the synthesis of Pt/Cu-MOF-74, 3.5 g of as prepared Cu-MOF-74 mixed in 50 ml methanol and sonicated for 0.5 h. CTAB-capped Pt nanoparticles (1 ml) with different concentrations (0.3 ml, 0.6 ml, and 1.0 ml), dissolved in a mixture of two solvents (9.6 ml of H2O and 0.4 ml of methanol), separately and added dropwise in a solution of Cu-MOF-74. The final solution was sonicated 10 min and refluxed at 35 °C for 14 h.

Carbonization.—Freshly prepared Cu-MOF-74, Pt0.5%/Cu-MOF-74, Pt1%/Cu-MOF-74, and Pt1.5%/Cu-MOF-74 (1.5 g) was heated to 900 °C for 2 h in a nitrogen atmosphere. The product obtained in black has been called Cu-PC-900, Pt0.5%/Cu-PC-900, Pt1%/Cu-PC-900, and Pt1.5%/Cu-PC-900. It is worth mentioning here that in this study, the carbonization period at 900 °C was extended in comparison with the literature methods for improved graphitization and elimination of all impurities like oxides.

Physical characterization.—X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed using 5° to 80° using Cu-Kα source on an X-ray powder diffractometer (RIGAKU Company, Japan). The image of an electron microscope (FESEM) was obtained from the field emission scanning microscope of the Hitachi su8220. During the test, the voltage range is 0.1 kV to 30 kV. Analysis of transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), and energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) on TECNAI G2 F20 was carried out. Analysis of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed using X-ray source Al-Kα (1486.6 eV, 15 kV, 5 mA) on super spectrometer axes. ASAP2020 calculated the adsorption isotherm for the desorption. TGA research was performed on Netzsch sta409.

Electrochemical characterization.—The electrochemical measurements are performed on the conventional three-electrode electrochemical workstation CHI760E. The graphite rod is used as the counter electrode, the saturated calomel electrode (SCE) is used as the reference electrode, and a 5 mm diameter glass carbon electrode (GCE) was used as the working electrode. The collected data are calibrated to a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) E(RHE) = E(SCE) + 0.241 + 0.059 pH. The prepared catalyst (2.5 mg) was combined with 1 ml isopropanol and 50 μl Nafion solution, and for 30 min ultrasonic treatment to obtain uniform ink. 20 μl of the resulting ink is then put on the carbon disc surface and dried at ambient temperature.

#### Results and Discussion

First, Cu-MOF-74 was prepared, and then prepared Pt nanoparticles with various concentrations are encapsulated on the surface of Cu-MOF-74, and then carbonized at 900 °C (Scheme [1](#page-2-0)). The Cu-MOF-74 surface provides ample surface for expanding the Pt nanoparticles. The introduction of Pt nanoparticles leads to carbon ring distortion, which results in many carbon matrixes defects. The presence of such defects is a condition required to boost the catalytic activity. According to the ICP analysis, the contents of Pt are 0.48, 0.98, and 1.30 wt.%.

XRD characterization.—The X-ray diffraction patterns (XRD) for all samples are shown in Fig. [1.](#page-3-0) In the XRD spectra of precarbonized samples, no apparent diffraction peaks corresponding to amorphous carbon are observed, which can be covered by sharp Cu-MOF-74 diffraction peaks (Fig. [1a](#page-3-0)). Simulated peaks of Cu-MOF-74 match well on such peaks. For the carbonized samples (Fig. [1](#page-3-0)b), there are two peaks represent the metal surface; these peaks are of metal Cu. The Cu surface reflection (111) and (200) showed peaks at 2 = 43.2° and 50.3°, respectively. There is no peak corresponding to Pt, indicating that Pt is in low content and deposited well on the surface of Cu-MOF-74.

Specific surface area characterization.—The pore structure of hybrid materials was characterized by isothermal desorption of N2 adsorption. All samples demonstrate the adsorption characteristic of a graded pore structure (Table [I,](#page-3-1) Fig. [2](#page-4-0)) The hysteresis loop under high relative pressure is mainly caused by macroporous adsorption, and the hysteresis loop of hybrid materials is significantly reduced, which proves that the cavity of Cu-MOF-74 is occupied by Pt nanoparticles. The pore size distribution of Pt nanoparticles on the surface of Cu-MOF-74 hybrid material reveals a clustered bimodal pore size, and the larger mesopores come from the shell of carbon. The specific surface area of the Cu-MOF-74 is 1449 m2 g−<sup>1</sup> is much

higher compared to all other prepared catalysts,  $Pt_{1.5\%}$ / Cu-PC-900 (542 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>) has the lowest specific surface area. The decrease in BET-specific surface area is due to metal nanoparticles being loaded and some micropores being plugged in. Additionally, changing the content of Pt nanoparticles will change the number of micropores

and mesopores. This layered pore structure plays an essential role in the catalytic reaction to ORR, which is useful for the reaction's accessibility and mass transfer. <sup>25,31</sup> The material has an isotherm type IV (Fig. 2), indicating the presence of multiple pore sizes ranging from micropores to macropores. The adsorption potential increases sharply at low relative pressure, implying the existence of micropores (pore size is less than 2 nm).<sup>6,11</sup> At medium relative pressure, there is a small slope, and the gap between the adsorption band and the desorption band indicates the existence of mesopores (pore size is between 2–50 nm).<sup>5,9</sup> The explanation for the low proportion of mesopores in Cu-PC-900 is the prolongation of carbonization time, resulting in microporous and porosity increase. Many mesopores change from thermal shrinking to microporous, or thermal fracturing to large porosity. 15,22 The special porosity is created at high temperature by the evaporation of gas components. The removal of the organic linker and the high temperature evaporation of the solvent can also produce additional porosity in the matrices. 4,32 The presence of these three porous regions makes the catalyst an ideal candidate material for assisted metal nanoparticles and reveals the tight regulation of oxygen diffusion in ORR by pore size.<sup>51</sup> However, the mass transfer and diffusion of oxygen molecules in ORR can still be facilitated by many porous areas, such as mesopores and macroporous.<sup>26,31</sup> The rapid drop in peak intensity also shows that metal nanoparticles are very small in size and that the pores are not completely plugged. <sup>39,41</sup> The catalyst has better ORR activity, due to the unusual arrangement of metal nanoparticles on the porous carbon carrier surface. 1,20

FE-SEM and TEM characterization.—FE-SEM and TEM (Figs. 3-5 and S1-S8 is available online at stacks.iop.org/JSS/9/ 065021/mmedia) characterized the surface morphology, pore structure, size, and distribution of the nanoparticles. It can be seen from the SEM images (Figs. 3, S1-S6) that the surface of Cu-MOF-74 and Cu-PC-900 carbon is cotton-like, the sphere and sponge are distributed randomly, and the porosity is solid. It shows unique porous structures with abundant micropores, mesopores, and macropores (Figs. S1–S2). The copper sample is composed of nanocrystalline aggregates, forming a network of relatively uniform size mesopores, which is very consistent with the distribution of mesopore size provided by isothermal N<sub>2</sub> adsorption-desorption. The porous structure of Cu-PC900 indicates that use this as the electrocatalyst support is rational. The structures of Cu-MOF-74 after deposition of different contents of Pt nanoparticles are quite like Cu-PC-900, which has sponge-like form, spherical shape, folding/irregularity. TEM and STEM images show the nanoparticles are distributed evenly and completely integrated into the carbon matrix (Figs. 4 and S8). Every nanoparticle is coated with a thin carbon layer that can provide additional stability and life in additional electrochemical tests; the size of nanoparticles is approximately uniform, less than 5 nm (Fig. 6), and the distance from the lattice plane is 0.208 nm, corresponding to the crystal plane (111) of Cu (Fig. 5). The image of the EDS (Fig. 3) exhibits that

Pt1%/Cu-PC-900 contains 0.94 wt.% Pt; it is the same as the feeding ratio. Pure Cu-MOF-74 quickly develops into large particles (Fig. [1](#page-3-0)b), but after deposition of Pt nanoparticles, the size decreased, the reason must be that after deposition of Pt nanoparticles pore size shrinkage and total size decreased. High contents of C (73.88 wt.%) indicating that at high temperature (900 °C) organic linker decomposed into C. The content of Cu is 14.89 wt.%, and thus showing that there is no impurity; it means particles are highly dispersed on the surface. However, the low content of Pt nanoparticles did not provide enough room for the growth of it on the surface of Cu-MOF-74. The content was further increased; only a small number of particles were observed. Therefore, for the effective synthesis of hybrid material, the mass ratio is very critical, and the best feeding ratio is 1% in the present work. The optimized feed ratio, the appropriate matrix, and the limited growth of particles, therefore, ensure the successful synthesis of the Pt/Cu-MOF-74 hybrid materials.

TGA characterization.—TGA was used to study the stability of MOFs. As shown in Fig. [7](#page-9-0), the first weight loss at 10 °C–200 °C is 18.5%, which is used to extract cavity molecules from the water of the guest. Then, between 200 °C and 400 °C, there was no weight loss, indicating no chemical decomposition occurred during this temperature. The results show that the guest water molecules can be isolated, and the compounds begin to decompose ab The weight shift of the graded microporous, mesoporous content below 200 °C in the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) is attributed to the loss of solvent guest molecules. The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed on nanoparticles prepared for MOF. TGA demonstrates good thermal stability of the MOF nanodots at 400 °C. The weight loss of the first step in the 50 °C–120 °C range is around 39%, suggesting the elimination of the water and DMF molecules in the pore of the MOF structure. At 400 °C, about 50% of the weight loss occurred in the second step, indicating the decomposition of the MOF structure.

The porosity of Cu-MOF-74 was analyzed by isothermal desorption by nitrogen adsorption. One of MOF's most significant properties is its thermal stability, which defines its possible uses. M-MOF-74's thermal stability primarily depends on the properties of the divalent metals. Figure 7 displays the Cu-MOF-74, Pt/Cu-MOF-74, and conventional Cu-MOF-74 and Pt/Cu-MOF-74 pyrolysis samples. The thermal stability of Cu-MOF-74 is approximately the same as that of Pt/Cu-MOF-74 and is roughly in the center of the stable Cu-MOF-74 range. The TGA curve of Cu-MOF-74 varies from that of Pt/Cu-MOF-74, not only in the decomposition temperature of the above relation but also in the residual number, that is, in the residual weight after all organic parts have been extracted. Likewise, Cu will be produced from Cu-MOF-74 under 800 °C after the experiment. The residual weight disparity between Cu samples must be related to the weight of Pt/Cu-MOF-74 as opposed to Cu-MOF-74.

FTIR characterization.—FTIR has been investigating the chemical surface properties of the nanoparticles. The FTIR spectra of MOFs were calculated in the 500–4000 cm<sup>-1</sup> range (Fig. 8). The

broad peak at 3401 cm<sup>-1</sup> is known as the characteristic absorption of the inorganic chain's O-H bond, suggesting that the hydrogen bond is formed between MOFs and H<sub>2</sub>O, and the peaks at 3117 and 791 cm<sup>-1</sup> correspond to the characteristic symmetric vibration and bending vibration of the in saturated phenyl C–H bond on the MOFs ligand. The peak value at 1106 cm<sup>-1</sup> is due to the carboxyl group vibration absorption of the C=O bond. FTIR spectra show that the characteristic absorption peak of MOFs has not modified the composite structure of MOFs has high stability. At 1558 cm<sup>-1</sup>, 1450 cm<sup>-1</sup>, and 1409 cm<sup>-1</sup> the characteristic of the coordinating group of carboxylic acid was observed. The transmission can be at 920 cm<sup>-1</sup> in relation to the -OH. In MOF nanoparticles, the transmission peak at 480 cm<sup>-1</sup> represents the metal-O bond as opposed to dobdc ligands, indicating the formation of MOF. The infrared spectral region of around 650–1800 cm<sup>-1</sup> is generally considered to be the fingerprint of the materials, particularly when they contain organics. Although PXRD is more sensitive to material structure (long-range information), this region of the infrared spectrum is more sensitive to the conformation of organic molecules and the local environment (short-range information), so the two technologies complement one another to some degree. Figure 8 shows the FTIR spectra Cu-MOF-74 and Pt/Cu-MOF-74 and the free protonation linker dhtp. The connection between the infrared spectra of the two MOFs is obvious, and it can be concluded that they both follow a similar pattern. Conversely, there are more differences in the linker dhtp continuum than similarities. Therefore, the Cu-MOF-74 material described here has not only the crystal order similar to that of Pt/Cu-MOF-74 material but also the organic bonding condition is exactly the same, which strongly indicates that it is indeed a type of Cu-based MOF-74 material.

XPS characterization.—XPS studies have been conducted to assess the carbon supply and oxidation status of electrocatalysts as well as surface element composition (Fig. 9). Pt4f spectral deconvolution is divided into two peaks, corresponding to Pt 4F7/2 low bound energy band and Pt4f<sub>5/2</sub> high bound energy band. The metal Pt can be measured against the lowest binding energy value of Pt 4f at 71.5 and 74.8 eV. The lowest binding energy component at 72.7 and 75.8 eV can be allocated to PtO. The core energy levels and satellite peaks of Cu2p<sub>3/2</sub> and Cu2p<sub>1/2</sub> are shown in Fig. 9 also. The metal Cu is related to peak Cu 2P<sub>3/2</sub> at 856.6 eV and peak Cu 2p<sub>1/2</sub> at 874.7 eV, respectively. The satellite peaks are expected to be 862.0 and 881.0 eV, due to the influence of Cu. The relatively low strength of the CuO peak indicates a small amount of nickel oxide is present on the surface. Compared to the standard 852.2 eV binding energy, the Cu2P binding energy changes by 0.25 eV. The negative displacement of Pt 4 f and the positive displacement of Cu2p show that Pt and Cu's electronic density has a big influence on one another, which further supports Cu's electronic contribution to Pt. Atomic lines C 1s are also used to classify groups C-O and C=O (Fig. 9c). The core value of SP3 carbon with C 1s is 284.5 eV. The other peak components at 285.2 and 286.1 eV are connected to the carbon type C-O and C=O, respectively. XPS findings indicate that the analyzed electrocatalyst surface consists of carbon (75.17 wt.%), oxygen (7.51 wt.%), platinum (1.01 wt.%), and copper (14.21 wt.%). CuO's peak intensity is relatively weak, meaning a small amount of copper oxide is present on the surface. The low copper content also confirmed the presence of copper as the base of bimetallic platinum copper nanoparticles, but only the XPS of the sample surface was not completely detected, and similar results were also found in the structure of platinum copper. Throughout this study, X-ray analysis clearly indicates that the electronic interaction between Pt and Cu is very similar to the core-shell structure in the literature, but since the copper particles are completely enclosed inside the carbon-based carrier, accurate morphology work is not possible. The findings of XPS verified that Pt nanoparticles and Cu-MOF-74 interact. Through doping Pt nanoparticles into Cu-MOF-74 to change surface and electronic structure, the interaction between metal active center and substratum can be improved to improve its catalytic activity.

Electrochemical characterization.—The electrochemical properties of the catalyst were calculated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) under the same experimental conditions and compared to industrial Pt/C (20 wt.%). Different peaks in the hydrogen adsorption/desorption cycle and the formation/reduction of Pt oxide in the potential middle area were observed in the CV curve of the synthesis catalyst (Fig. 10c). The ORR catalytic activity of synthetic and industrial catalysts was evaluated by LSV measurements at 1600 rpm using a rotating disc electrode (RDE) in a 0.1 M KOH solution saturated with oxygen (Fig. 10a). Results showed that the onset potential (E<sub>0</sub>) of the Pt<sub>1%</sub>/Cu-PC-900 catalyst was around 1.03 V, which was a positive displacement compared to that of the commercial Pt/C Pt/C (20 wt.%) catalyst (0.91 V). The enhanced ORR activity of Pt<sub>1%</sub>/Cu-PC-900 may, therefore, be due to the synergistic effect of Pt-Cu in bimetallic catalyst nanoparticles and the enhancement of ORR activity through enough thin layer carbon carrier coating. Pt nanoparticles completely embedded sponsored on porous carbon, and the carbon coating was considered the major factor in preventing Pt nanocrystals from fracturing, defects, and aggregation in ORR activity. However, the interaction between Pt nanocrystals and carbon layers is very critical for controlling the Pt nanocrystal's electronic structure. The catalyst's electrocatalytic efficiency was calculated by half-wave potential  $(E_{1/2})$  (Table II), as shown in the polarization curve (Figs. 10a, 10d). Because the Pt content of these catalysts is relatively low, and the Cu content increases in proportion, catalyst activity is greatly reduced. Consequently, the catalyst  $E_o$  and  $E_{1/2}$  values are relatively small at 0.5% and 1.5% load. The  $Pt_{1\%}/Cu$ -PC-900 efficiency improvement is related to optimum metal loading rate and good electronic interaction. While the loading quantity of Pt is 1%, the kinetic current is superior to that of Pt/C (20 wt.%), which indicates that the supply of copper to platinum via electron promotes molecular oxygen interaction and increases the rate of reaction.

The polarization curves of  $Pt_{1\%}/Cu$ -PC-900 at different rotating speeds (400–2000 rpm) are recorded to evaluate the ORR kinetics and measure the electron transfer number(Fig. 10d). Koutecky-Levich (K-L) diagram is drawn from a set of curves of polarization under different potentialities (Figs. 10b, 10e). The results show a clear linear relationship between the first-order kinetic curve and the concentration of dissolved oxygen. The approximate transfer number for the electron is  $\sim$ 3.9, which is in good agreement with the theoretical value of 4.

As shown in Fig. 10f,  $Pt_{1\%}/Cu-PC-900$ 's lowest Tafel slope is 41.9 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>, which is well below Pt/C (72.5 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>), suggesting a high catalytic efficiency for ORR. The layered porous structure facilitates electrolyte diffusion and improves the kinetic performance of hybrid materials. The  $Pt_{1\%}/Cu-PC-900$ 's hierarchical porous structure effectively favored the rapid spread of active species to active sites. The decrease in the size and shortens the diffusion path and improves the transport of ions. Based on the above definition,  $Pt_{1\%}/Cu-PC-900$  has a strong electrocatalytic activity for ORR, which is characterized by (1) multi-layer porous

The stability of ORR electrocatalysts is very important to its practical application in the fuel cell. The chronoamperometry was measured at −0.5 V and 1600 rpm in O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH solution at ambient temperature to analyze stability in detail. As shown in Fig. [11](#page-12-23), Pt1%/Cu-PC-900 has high electrochemical stability and retains 98.5% of its initial current density after 36,000 s of activity, whereas the Cu-PC-900 and commercial Pt/C catalyst

retains just about 74.6% and 83.3% of its initial current density, respectively. The Pt<sub>1%</sub>/Cu-PC-900 has good stability, which may be attributed to the graphite layer formed in situ around the metal nanoparticles to enhance the catalyst's corrosion resistance. The limiting current density of the Pt<sub>1%</sub>/Cu-PC-900 is significantly higher than Pt/C (20 wt.%); this is maybe due to the high surface area as well as highly porous structure. The doped CTAB-caped Pt nanoparticles can have two roles: one is it can form a stable active site during the pyrolysis cycle, and the other is that the residual metal compound directly acts as an active site. 25-27 According to the literature, metal oxides will significantly increase the ORR activity of the catalyst.<sup>29,31</sup> We believe that this may be one of the reasons why catalysts exhibit ORR superior to Pt/C catalysts because Cu is mostly present in the catalyst as oxides. The presence of transition metal nitrides and carbides will generate new ORR active sites for the catalyst, thereby greatly improving the performance of the Our copper-doped catalyst will contribute to the formation of active sites on copper nitride, and copper carbide, resulting in our cocatalysts have superior activity compared to commercial Pt/C. In commercial Pt/C catalyst, aggregation and migration of Pt nanoparticles are important factors for the degradation of Pt nanoparticles. 10,15,3

#### Conclusions

In summary, supported on high surface carbon Pt-Ni bimetallic electrocatalysts obtained by prolonged carbonization of Cu-MOF-74 at 900 °C are successfully prepared for ORR. Different techniques characterized the synthesized electrocatalysts, and it was observed that Cu had altered Pt's electronic structure and embedded the

bimetallic nanoparticles in the carbon matrix. The small-size particles blocked the carbon support microporous regions resulting in lower surface area of the BET. The Pt<sub>1%</sub>/Cu-PC-900 proved superior ORR activity over commercial catalyst Pt/C (20 wt.%) in both E<sub>o</sub> and E<sub>1/2</sub> terms. The synergistic effect between Pt-Cu nanoparticles and the carbon is encapsulating effect; both played a significant role in improving catalytic activity together. The use of a high carbon surface area with diverse porosity is expected to play its vital role in fuel cell technology in the future. The ultra-low Pt loading with uniform distribution, superior catalytic activity, and durability indicates that our strategy is facile and cost-efficient, and it has great potential in developing high-performing electrocatalysts for PEMFCs. Therefore, our new approach has also been dedicated to developing and discovering precious metal-free catalysts to reduce conventional precious-metal-based catalysts, which have a major effect on the development of PEMFCs.

#### **Abstract**

It is a challenge to improve the long-term durability of Pd-based electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in fuel cells. Herein, Pd/CeO<sub>2</sub>-C-T ( $T=800\,^{\circ}$ C, 900  $^{\circ}$ C and 1000  $^{\circ}$ C) hybrid catalysts with metal–support interaction are prepared from Ce-based metal organic framework precursor. Abundant tiny CeO<sub>2</sub> nanoclusters are produced to form nanorod structures with uniformly distributed carbon through a calcination process. Meanwhile, both carbon and CeO<sub>2</sub> nanoclusters have good contact with the following deposited surfactant-free Pd nanoclusters. Benefited from the large specific surface area, good conductivity and structure integrity, Pd/CeO<sub>2</sub>-C-900 exhibits the best electrocatalytic ORR performance: onset potential of 0.968 V and half-wave potential of 0.857 V, outperforming those obtained on Pd/C counterpart. In addition, the half-wave potential only shifts 7 mV after 6000 cycles of accelerated durability testing, demonstrating robust durability.

#### 1. Introduction

The fuel cell, which directly converts the chemical energy of fuels into electrical energy without being limited by the Carnot efficiency, is a highly efficient power source with quiet operation. Its high fuel conversion efficiency makes it an ideal choice [1, 2]. Alkaline Fuel Cells, in particular, display a greater propensity to react more readily at a low temperatures and exhibit higher efficiency [3–6]. However, the sluggish kinetics of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at the cathode [7], which is several orders of magnitude slower than that of the fuel oxidation reaction at the anode [8], significantly

constrains the performance of alkaline fuel cells. Therefore, the rational design of electrocatalysts with high activity and stability has been the focus of considerable research efforts aimed at enhancing the performance of ORR processes.

In recent years, extensive research has shown that Pd-based catalysts have emerged as a promising replacement for Pt cathodes for ORR in alkaline electrolytes due to their excellent catalytic activity, cost effectiveness and similar electronic structure to Pt [9–12]. But the poor durability of Pd-based catalysts dramatically limits thier practical application in fuel cells [13–16]. Boosting the electrochemical stability of Pd-based catalysts is a significant challenge. Numerous strategies have been implemented to improve the durability of Pd catalysts [17–19]. For example, the incorporation of metals into Pd to form alloys such as Pd–Pt [19], Pd–Co [20], Pd–Fe

[\[21](#page-8-7)], Pd–Cr [\[22](#page-8-8)], Pd–Ni [\[23](#page-8-9)], Pd–Rh[[24\]](#page-8-10), Pd–Ag [\[25](#page-8-11)], Pd– Au[[26\]](#page-8-12), Pd–Cu [\[27](#page-8-13)], Pd–Mo[[28\]](#page-8-14), Pd–Ti[[29\]](#page-8-15), Pd–Sn[[30\]](#page-8-16), Pd–Y [\[31](#page-8-17)], Pd–Mn [\[32](#page-8-18)], Pd–W[[33\]](#page-8-19), Pd–Zn[[34\]](#page-8-20) and Pd– Ru [\[35](#page-8-21)] demonstrates improved electrocatalytic activity resulting from the synergistic effect between Pd and other metals. Unfortunately, the alloyed metals confer weaker interaction with traditional carbon-supports, resulting in a reduction of long-term durability[[36,](#page-8-22) [37\]](#page-8-23). To overcome this problem, it is vital to find a suitable stabilizer that remains highly stable in the alkaline working condition of ORR and enhances the electrocatalytic activity of Pd during ORR.

CeO2, one of the most frequently encountered rare earth metal oxides, has attracted interest due to its excellent oxygen storage capacity in various fields such as hydrocarbon reformers, exhaust gas converters and water–gas shift reactions [\[38](#page-8-24), [39](#page-8-25)]. The oxidation state of ceria has the ability to shift reversibly between +3 and +4, altering the electronic state of Pd, in response to changes in oxygen concentration [\[40](#page-8-26)[–43](#page-8-27)]. The addition of CeO<sup>2</sup> can help enhance the corrosion resistance of carbon species in alkaline media, but its poor electric conductivity hinders the utilization of Pd/CeO<sup>2</sup> composite as ORR catalysts. Therefore, the development of Pd/CeO2-C ternary composite is an effective strategy to enhance the activity and durability in ORR [\[44](#page-9-0)[–46](#page-9-1)].

Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) are a type of porous materials with highly regular crystal morphology, adjustable function, and controllable pore diameters. A special type of metal–organic bond is formed by coordination between a metal and an organic ligand [\[47](#page-9-2)[–49](#page-9-3)]. These materials are naturally porous, so this property is often exploited to create porous carbon carriers or carbon–metal hybrid structures for electrochemical reactions, thereby enhancing electrical conductivity and mass transfer[[50–](#page-9-4)[53\]](#page-9-5). However, the special crystalline properties of MOF materials have not yet been fully recognized or exploited[[54\]](#page-9-6).

Herein, the study makes use of the distinctive properties of Ce-based metal organic framework (Ce-MOF) to synthesize an interactive Pd/CeO2-C hybrid catalyst. Abundant tiny CeO<sup>2</sup> nanoclusters (NCs, *∼*3 nm) are arranged into nanorod structure with evenly distributed carbon species. Subsequently, the surfactant-free Pd NCs are successfully loaded onto the structure and well-connected with both carbon and CeO2. The closely linked structures enhance conductivity, catalytic activity and long-term stability for ORR by providing adequate interfaces for electron transfer and electronic interaction.

## *3.1. Structures and characterization of samples*

To obtain information on the crystal structure and composition of the synthesized catalysts, XRD patterns were measured. The XRD patterns of Ce-MOF (figure S1) is highly consistent with the results presented in the relevant literature[[55\]](#page-9-7). The XRD patterns of CeO2-C-T and Pd/CeO2-T samples are shown in figure [1](#page-3-0). The peaks observed at 28.5*◦* , 33.1*◦* , 47.5*◦* and 56.3*◦* of the three calcined CeO2-C-T samples correspond

to (111), (200), (220), and (331) crystal facets of cubic CeO<sup>2</sup> (JCPDS No. 01-081-0792), respectively (figure [1\(](#page-3-0)a)). Particularly, CeO2-C-900 exhibits more pronounced diffraction peaks, indicating good crystallinity at this temperature. After the loading of Pd, the four diffraction peaks assigning to CeO<sup>2</sup> remained stable, thereby verifying the robust structure stability (figure [1](#page-3-0)(b)). A broad peak located at 20 *◦*–40 *◦* can be ascribed to the amorphous carbon[[56\]](#page-9-8). The peak intensity dramatically varies may due to the different calcination temperatures. Moreover, three additional peaks at approximately 40.0*◦* , 46.7*◦* and 68.2*◦* can be observed, which are ascribed to the (111), (002) and (022) crystal facets of cubic Pd (JCPDS No. 01-087-0638). The coexistence of Pd, CeO<sup>2</sup> and C in the as-prepared hybrid materials is clearly evident from the XRD results. Table [1](#page-3-1) shown the brunauer–emmett–teller (BET) results of the samples. The BET surface area (*S*BET) was obviously reduced after loading Pd, possibly due to the palladium species occupying the pore space.

The unique nanostructure further ensures good conductivity and structure stability, thereby offering promising for high catalytic activity in ORR. It should be noted that there are some voids and fissures in the rods, possibly due to the loss of organic ligands and adsorbed water which contributes to the large *S*BET values (*>*260 m<sup>2</sup> *·*g *−*1 for CeO2-C-T hybrids, table [1\)](#page-3-1). The average dominant pore size was 6.17 nm, which is favorable for mass transfer in ORR. The lattice spacings of 0.271, 0.311 and 0.191 nm can be assigned to the (200), (111) and (220) planes of CeO<sup>2</sup> (figures [2\(](#page-4-0)d)–(f)), in agreement with the XRD results.

<span id="page-4-0"></span>Figure 2. (a)–(c) TEM, and (d)–(f) HRTEM images of CeO<sub>2</sub>-C-800, CeO<sub>2</sub>-C-900, and CeO<sub>2</sub>-C-1000, respectively.

Many tiny Pd nanocrystals (NCs) have been formed and uniformly dispersed in Pd/CeO<sub>2</sub>-C-T nanorods (figures 3(a)-(c)). Thus, it is safe to deduce that Pd, CeO<sub>2</sub> and carbon are well mixed with each other, affording superior structure integrity. Due to the very close particle sizes of Pd and CeO<sub>2</sub> NCs, it is difficult to distinguish between the two. The average nanoparticle sizes calculated by statistical analysis are 4.14  $\pm$  1.36 nm, 3.31  $\pm$  0.58 nm, and 3.36  $\pm$  0.65 nm for Pd/CeO<sub>2</sub>-C-800, Pd/CeO<sub>2</sub>-C-900, and Pd/CeO<sub>2</sub>-C-1000, respectively (insets in figures 3(a)–(c)). TEM-EDS mapping results clearly demonstrate the successful loading of Pd in Pd/CeO2-C-T hybrids, and the Pd, Ce, O and C elements are homogeneously distributed (figures 3(d)–(f)). The interplanar distances of 0.221 nm for Pd (111) and 0.311 nm for CeO<sub>2</sub> (111) planes can be observed in figures 3(g)–(i). In addition, for a better understanding of the unique structure of Pd/CeO<sub>2</sub>-C-T, CeO<sub>2</sub> and Pd/CeO<sub>2</sub> samples without carbon were prepared and the SEM and TEM images are presented for comparison (figure S3). In the absence of the carbon matrix, the commercial CeO<sub>2</sub> sample presents densely packed nanoparticular film morphology. The loading of Pd species is in the form of large and aggregated nanoparticles (NPs) (figures S3(e)-(h)). It is clear from these structural characterizations that the Pd/CeO<sub>2</sub> C-T hybrids establish metal-support interactions between Pd, CeO<sub>2</sub> and C, thereby ensuring a uniform distribution of catalytically active sites and providing an ideal catalytic environment for electro-catalytic reactions. As far as we know, metal NPs have a tendency to aggregate and reduce surface energy, which presents a significant challenge in terms of their dispersion following pyrolysis [57]. However, due to the specific background of the Ce element, the Ce-MOF derived CeO<sub>2</sub> NCs in this study avoided the aggregation problem [38].

XPS measurements were performed to clarify the surface chemical states of CeO<sub>2</sub>-C-T and Pd/CeO<sub>2</sub>-C-T. The Ce  $3d_{5/2}$ and Ce  $3d_{3/2}$  can be deconvolved into five peaks, respectively in Ce 3d XPS spectra [58, 59] (figures 4(a) and (b)). In particular,  $v^0$  (879.8 eV), v' (883.9 eV),  $u^0$  (898.0 eV), and u'(902.0 eV) refer to the Ce<sup>3+</sup> species, while the other features represent the presence of the Ce<sup>4+</sup> species [60]. To represent the oxygen vacancies, the concentration of Ce<sup>3+</sup> is calculated using the ratio of the peak area of  $(Ce^{3+}/(Ce^{3+} + Ce^{4+}))$ , and the results are listed in table S1. Impressively, Pd/CeO<sub>2</sub>-C-900 exhibits the highest C<sub>Ce</sub><sup>3+</sup> value (48%), followed by Pd/CeO<sub>2</sub>-C-800 (42%) and Pd/CeO<sub>2</sub>-C-1000 (39%). The O 1s XPS spectra (figures 4(c) and (d)) reveal the presence of three distinct oxygen species: lattice oxygen  $(O_{\alpha}, 529.1 \text{ eV})$ , vacancy oxygen ( $O_{\beta}$ , 530.2 eV), and weakly bound oxygen species  $(O_{\gamma}, 532.2 \text{ eV})$ . The concentration of oxygen vacancies indicated by  $O_{\beta}/(O_{\alpha} + O_{\beta} + O_{\gamma})$  [61] follows the sequence:  $CeO_2$ -C-900 (0.41) >  $CeO_2$ -C-1000 (0.40) >  $CeO_2$ -C-800 (0.23), while it rands in the sequence of Pd/CeO<sub>2</sub>-C-900  $(0.74) > Pd/CeO_2-C-800 (0.54) > Pd/CeO_2-C-1000 (0.43)$ for Pd/CeO<sub>2</sub> catalysts (table S1). In the Pd 3d XPS spectra (figure 4(e)), the metallic Pd and Pd<sup>2+</sup> species are represented by two peaks at 335.0 eV and 336.8 eV in the Pd 3d<sub>5/2</sub> spectra [62, 63]. Accordingly, the concentration of Pd<sup>2+</sup> in Pd/CeO<sub>2</sub>-C-T catalysts decreases in the following sequence: Pd/CeO<sub>2</sub>- $C-900 (0.53) > Pd/CeO_2-C-800 (0.47) > Pd/CeO_2-C-1000$ (0.40) > Pd/C (0.3) (table S1). The aforementioned results can be attributed to the interaction between the metal and the carrier. There may exist electron transfer between Pd and Ce<sup>4+</sup>: Pd loses electrons to become Pd<sup>2+</sup>, and Ce<sup>4+</sup> obtains electrons to become Ce<sup>3+</sup>. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that Pd/CeO<sub>2</sub>-C-900 exhibits the highest  $C_{Pd}^{2+}$  and  $C_{Ce}^{3+}$ .

# *3.2. ORR capabilities of Pd/CeO2-C-T*

The electrochemical activities of Pd/CeO2-C-T catalysts towards ORR were investigated in alkaline electrolyte using RDE voltammetry. The polarization curves were obtained in an O2-sarurated 0.1 M KOH electrolyte at a scan rate of 5 mV*·*s *−*1 and a rotation speed of 1600 rpm, as shown in figure [5](#page-6-0)(a). The onset potential (*E*0) and half-wave potential (*E*1/2) of Pd/CeO2-C-900 are determined to be 0.968 and 0.857 V vs. RHE, respectively. These values are more positive than those of Pd/C catalyst (0.886 and 0.791 V), Pd/CeO<sup>2</sup> (0.876 and 0.762 V), Pd/CeO2-C-800 (0.945 and 0.847 V), Pd/CeO2-C-1000 (0.909 and 0.804 V), and outperforms most reported Pd-based catalysts, like Pd/Co-N-C,

<span id="page-6-0"></span>Figure 5. (a) LSV curves of catalysts in 0.1 M KOH under saturated  $O_2$  with a sweep rate of 5 mV·s<sup>-1</sup>. (b) Comparison of  $E_0$  and  $E_{1/2}$  of all the catalysts. (c) CV curves and (d) tafel plots.

Au@Pd<sub>x</sub> structures and BiPd/C\_Pre (table S2). Figure 5(c) shows the CV curves within 0.2–1.2 V vs. RHE at a sweep rate of  $0.2 \text{ V} \cdot \text{s}^{-1}$ , all of the curves show a pronounced and well-defined cathodic peak, indicating the promising oxygen reduction capability. In comparison to the Pd/CeO<sub>2</sub>-C-800, Pd/CeO<sub>2</sub>-C-1000, Pd/C, and Pd/CeO<sub>2</sub> catalysts, the cathodic peak obtained on Pd/CeO<sub>2</sub>-C-900 is more positive, suggesting the highest ORR activity among the aforementioned catalysts. The corresponding Tafel plots of the kinetic current density  $(j_k)$  computed from the ORR polarization curves are shown in figure 5(d). In particular, the  $j_k$  value of Pd/CeO<sub>2</sub>-C-900 is the highest at the same applied potential, indicating that the Pd/CeO<sub>2</sub>-C-900 has the most favorable reaction kinetics. Together with the more positive  $E_0$  and  $E_{1/2}$  values, it forcefully shows that the Pd/CeO<sub>2</sub>-C-900 outperforms the other five catalysts in terms of ORR performance.

The electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) of the electrodes was determined by means of co-stripping analysis. CVs were obtained by CO stripping voltammetry in 0.1 M HClO<sub>4</sub> solution at a scan rate of 0.05 V·s<sup>-1</sup>. The ECSA value can be estimated by assuming that the oxidation of a complete monolayer of CO on palladium consumes a charge of 420  $\mu$ C·cm<sup>-2</sup> [64]. By integrating the area under the CO stripping peak, the ECSA of the catalyst was estimated. Among that, Pd/CeO<sub>2</sub>-C-900 has the largest ECSA (53 m<sup>2</sup>·g<sup>-1</sup>) compared to Pd/CeO<sub>2</sub>-C-800 (32 m<sup>2</sup>·g<sup>-1</sup>)

and Pd/CeO<sub>2</sub>-C-1000 (23 m<sup>2</sup>·g<sup>-1</sup>). There is evidence that Pd/CeO<sub>2</sub>-C-900 has a greater number of catalytically active sites and exhibits superior electrochemical accessibility.

To evaluate the ORR durability of the catalysts, accelerated durability tests were performed for 6000 cycles (figure 6(a)). The half-wave potential of the Pd/CeO<sub>2</sub>-C-900 exhibits an unspectacular degradation with a mere 7 mV negative shift, which is much lower than that of Pd/CeO2-C-800 (32 mV) and Pd/C (16 mV) (figure S4), suggesting excellent stability of Pd/CeO<sub>2</sub>-C-900 during ORR, which can be attributed to the favorable metal-support interaction among well dispersed Pd, CeO<sub>2</sub> and C. To gain further insight into the kinetics on Pd/CeO<sub>2</sub>-C-900, LSV tests were carried out employing RDE at different rotation speeds (figure 6(b)). On the basis of the Koutecky-Levich equations [65], the electron transfer number of Pd/CeO<sub>2</sub>-C-900 is calculated to be approximately 3.7 (figure 6(c)), which is in close agreement with the theoretical value for the direct oxygen reduction process (4e<sup>-</sup>), that implies the ORR process occurring on this catalyst is following the most efficient 4e<sup>-</sup> reduction route. To evaluate the electrocatalytic performance, long-term stability is also an important parameter of electrocatalysts. The above results powerfully suggest that Pd/CeO<sub>2</sub>-C-900 provides higher electrocatalytic ORR activity and long-term durability, making it a promising cathode catalyst for high-performance fuel cells. The reaction mechanism has been proposed in scheme 2. The conversion

of trivalent cerium to tetravalent cerium is achieved by the transfer of electrons between the cerium oxide carrier and the loaded palladium NCs which generates more oxygen vacancies and facilitates the enhancement of oxygen transport in the catalytic process. Meanwhile this interaction also improves the stability of the catalyst. Oxygen bound to the catalyst is reduced to water following a four-electron reaction path.

# **4. Conclusion**

The Pd/CeO2-C-T hybrid catalysts were prepared by depositing palladium sodium rice granules on the surface of CeO2- C-T hybrids derived from Ce-MOF precursors. Based on the XRD, TEM and XPS characterization results, the mixture was found to contain CeO<sup>2</sup> NCs, Pd NCs, and a carbon matrix. These three components were found to be in close contact with each other, with inter-electronic interactions and electron transfer, which resulted in notable enhancements in the electric conductivity, electrocatalytic activity, and long-term durability for ORR. The rational design of Pd-based electrocatalysts with high activity and stability may be elucidated by this work.

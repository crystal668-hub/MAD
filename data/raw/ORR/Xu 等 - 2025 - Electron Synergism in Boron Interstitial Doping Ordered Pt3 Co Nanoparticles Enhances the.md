**Ordered intermetallic Pt3Co compounds are highly promising alloy materials for oxygen electrocatalysis, while the sluggish kinetics and high cost of Pt still hinder their wide use in practical applications. In this work, boron atom gap-doped Pt3Co nanoparticles loaded on carbon nanobowls (B-Pt3Co/CNBs) are obtained to enhance the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance. The introduction of B atoms is responsible for the negative shift of the d-band center compared to Pt3Co, and the subsequent reduction process leads to the uniform loading of B-Pt3Co nanoparticles on hollow carbon nanobowls. It is demonstrated that B-Pt3Co/CNBs exhibit the best electrocatalytic performance for ORR with an onset potential of 1.095 V versus RHE and a half-wave potential of 0.985 versus RHE, as well as robust electrocatalytic stability with negligible activity decay even after 50 000 cycles. Experimental and theoretical calculations show that the introduction of the highly electronegative metalloid B leads the Pt atoms to lose electrons, which changes the electronic structure of Pt3Co that can weaken the bonding strength of Pt-O and accelerate the protonation and desorption of O\* on the surface of the B-Pt3Co/ CNB, reducing the energy barrier of the rate-determining step during the ORR process.**

way to solve environmental degradation and overcome the energy crisis.[\[1\]](#page-8-0) ZABs are currently used in transport and other applications, involving the cathodic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), which plays an important role in enabling energy conversion in zinc-air batteries.[\[2\]](#page-8-0) The reaction rate of ORR directly determines the performance of the ZABs due to the conversion efficiency that is limited by 4e<sup>−</sup> transfer, which restricts its large-scale application in the field of energy conversion.[\[3\]](#page-8-0) For the basic catalytic reaction, a "volcano" catalytic activity curve was proposed based on the recognized Sabatier's principle, which suggests that the optimal binding strength between surface sites and reaction intermediates yields the highest intrinsic activity.[\[4\]](#page-8-0) Pt is close to the apex of the volcano diagram, effectively promoting the 4e- trans-process, which is considered to be the most efficient ORR catalyst.[\[5\]](#page-8-0) Given the drawbacks of Pt

scarcity, high cost, and instability, there is an urgent need to develop an efficient and highly stable Pt-based catalyst.[\[3c,6\]](#page-8-0)

Nørskov et al. proposed that the binding and adsorption tendency of transition metals can be expressed in terms of the dband center, for which the higher values with respect to the Fermi energy level are in line with the stronger binding strength.[\[7\]](#page-8-0) The electronic state of the pure Pt catalyst surface not only facilitates the adsorption of oxygen molecules with the breaking of O═O bonds but also promotes the detachment of oxygen-containing intermediates produced during the reaction.[\[8\]](#page-8-0) However, the high adsorbed energy for oxygen on pure Pt still limits the ORR process, which leads to the urgent need for the adjustment of Pt to appropriately reduce the surface adsorption energy.[\[9\]](#page-8-0) Therefore, PtM (M = Co, Ni, Cu, or Fe) solid solution alloy catalysts have attracted wide attention due to the regulated electron adsorption energy of Pt surface while reducing the amount of Pt, which accelerates the desorption of oxygen-containing intermediates by shortening the interatomic distances between the nearest neighboring Pt-Pt, inducing compressive strains and downward shifts of the d-band centers in mutual coordination of

electronic and geometrical effects.[\[10\]](#page-8-0) However, since the disordered order of Pt and M in the solid solution alloy, the uniform electronic effects and high-voltage environments lead to the dissolution of the transition metal, resulting in an insufficient catalytic durability.[\[11\]](#page-9-0) As a result, intermetallic compounds with long-range ordered structures have received extensive attention in recent years, which can not only make full use of the modulation of transition metals but also suppress the lattice atom diffusion, greatly improving the interaction between Pt and the alloyed metal atoms in thermodynamics.[\[12\]](#page-9-0) For example, Deng et al. effectively synthesized monodisperse PtCu intermetallic compounds on mesoporous spheres through the engineering design of the crystal structure and the coordinated management of the carbon carriers. The unique electronic structure of PtCu intermetallic compounds produces a favorable effect on the ORR reaction process and stabilizes the transition metals in the crystals to a large extent.[\[13\]](#page-9-0) Additionally, Wang et al. successfully prepared carbon-loaded low-Pt ordered intermetallic nanoparticle catalysts by inducing ordered transitions in monodisperse low-Pt alloys with high stability, and the analysis of ordered/disordered structures before and after sintering revealed that ordered intermetallic nanoparticles possessed higher activities and stabilities than those of other low-Pt electrocatalysts and conventional ordered Pt-rich intermetallic compounds.[\[14\]](#page-9-0) Although the intermetallic compounds play an important role in the improvement of catalyst stability, the surface structural stability of the catalysts, especially in the presence of highly reducing metals, still leaves much to be desired for the improvement of their thermal and catalytic stability in the oxidation reaction in the practical application of batteries.

Compared with conventional intermetallic compound catalysts, the introduction of nonmetallic or metalloid elements (e.g., H, B, C, N, and P) into the lattice interstitials of intermetallic compounds can adjust the electronic structure of the intermetallic compound, which modulates the surface adsorption strength of the intermediates and improves the catalytic activity of the catalysts.[\[15\]](#page-9-0) Peng and co-workers synthesized a catalyst of ultrafine FeCoNi-C-N transition metal interstitial solid solution with a small amount of C and N atoms dissolve in the octahedral interstitial sites, leading the increase of metal–metal bond length around the interstitial C and N atoms, which show a suitable dband center away from EF that can weaken H\* adsorption by filling in more antibonding.[\[16\]](#page-9-0) Intrinsically, the interstitial doping not only induces electron transfer and/or orbital hybridization of the catalyst but also leads to spatial effects due to tensile strains to induce lattice extensions that alter the d-band center values of the catalyst.[\[17\]](#page-9-0) As Mao et al. reported, inserting B into the lattice of Pt weakens the binding of OH and O to the surface Pt sites and mitigates oxidative damage,[\[17d\]](#page-9-0) and Wang et al. also believed that the adsorption of intermediates by B-doping-induced lattice expansion achieves the improvement of ORR performance.[\[18\]](#page-9-0) Therefore, the introduction of nonmetallic elements can prove that the influence of nonmetallic doping on the electronic and spatial geometry effects can achieve an effective enhancement of the catalyst performance for ORR reaction, while the gap-doped nonmetallic elements in intermetallic compounds have not been investigated on their electrocatalytic activity and stability.

Herein, the ORR performance brought about by the lattice expansion/compression is regulated by the electron synergism

induced by B-doped ordered intermetallic Pt3Co compounds (B-Pt3Co). The ordered lattice structure stabilizes Co dissolution and improves catalyst stability, which effectively modulates the d-band center value of ordered intermetallic Pt3Co compounds. Moreover, B interstitial doping induces lattice extension/compression strains to modulate the electronic structure, and the electron-deficient structure of B leads to an efficient charge distribution. The optimization of the electronic structure effectively regulates the d-band center value of the catalyst, accelerates the O\* protonation and desorption rates on the catalyst surface, and facilitates the oxygen reduction process. The electrocatalytic studies show that the obtained B-Pt3Co on porous hollow nanobowls exhibits excellent ORR activity with robust methanol tolerance and long-term durability. These results deepen the understanding of electron synergism between B and metal atoms for improving the ORR mechanism and provide essential guidance for constructing metalloid-doping-ordered intermetallic compounds for various applications.

# **2. Results and Discussion**

# **2.1. Characterization of B-Pt3Co/CNBs**

The synthesized process of B-Pt3Co/CNBs is illustrated in **Figure 1**. First, the CNBs were obtained according to the previous work.[\[19\]](#page-9-0) Then, K2PtCl4 and C4H6CoO4-4H2O with 2.0 wt.% NH3-H2O were added to solution containing NH4F, H3BO3, and the synthesized CNBs. After pre-cooling, borane dimethylamine complex (DMAB) was added to the above solution and transferred to room temperature. Finally, the product obtained was collected and dried after annealing at 700 °C under a H2/Ar atmosphere. The B-doped Pt3Co nanoparticles were obtained by lowtemperature reduction on nanocarbon bowls with K2PtCl4 and C4H6CoO4-4H2O as the metal precursors, H3BO3 and DMAB as the B source and reducing agent, respectively, and the nanocarbon bowls as the functional carriers, and ordered intermetallic compounds were obtained by high-temperature reduction on the nanocarbon bowls. It is noteworthy that the presence of B atoms in the interstitial positions of the Pt3Co crystal structure shows a significant effect on the crystal surface free energy. The thermodynamically driven weakening of the Pt-Co bond by the doped B atoms enhances the adsorption/desorption efficiency of O2 by Pt atoms, and due to the synergistic effect of B, the desorption of oxygen-containing intermediates was accelerated kinetically, which effectively promoted the protonation process of the ORR, thus improving the activity and stability of the nanocatalysts.

The crystal structures and lattice extensions of the obtained B-Pt<sub>2</sub>Co/CNBs were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Figure 2a). The four characteristic peaks of B-Pt<sub>3</sub>Co/CNBs at 40.53°, 47.1°, 68.8°, and 83.0° correspond to the (111), (200), (220), and (311) facets of Pt<sub>3</sub>Co, respectively, which are consistent with those of the Joint Committee on Powder Diffraction Standards (JCPDS) or the corresponding inorganic Crystal Structure Database (ICSD).[20] Among these, there are obvious characteristic superlattice peaks of ordered intermetallic structure at 23.1°, 32.8°, 53.1°, and 58.6°, which correspond to the (100), (110), (210), and (211) facets of the ordered Pt<sub>3</sub>Co phase, respectively (JCPDS No. 29-0499), providing preliminary evidence of the structural ordering of the sample. A slab XRD peak of graphene (002) facet appeared in the  $2\theta$  range from 20 to 30°, indicating the presence of CNB as a functional support. B-Pt<sub>3</sub>Co/CNBs showed the Pt<sub>3</sub>Co structure, suggesting that the insertion of B atoms into the Pt<sub>3</sub>Co lattice did not change its intrinsic crystal structure.[21] In addition, the diffraction peaks of the B-Pt<sub>3</sub>Co/CNBs are slightly shifted to a lower angle compared to those of the Pt<sub>3</sub>Co/CNBs, which is attributed to the lattice distortion and strain induced by the doped B atoms, increasing the lattice spacing.<sup>[22]</sup> The lattice strain detected by XRD proves the lattice swelling caused by B doping in the Pt<sub>3</sub>Co crystal lattice.

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images showed that the morphology of CNBs was in the shape of nanobowls with a narrow diameter distribution, and the average diameter was  $\approx 110$  nm (Figures S1–S3, Supporting Information). The SEM, TEM, and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images of the B-Pt<sub>3</sub>Co/CNBs showed that the B-Pt<sub>3</sub>Co NPs were well dispersed without obvious aggregation, and a large number of the B-Pt<sub>3</sub>Co NPs with a nanoparticle size around  $5.57 \pm 0.08$  nm were evenly embedded in the pores of the carbon surface (Figures 2b–d). It is well known that the high annealing temperature required for atomic ordering accelerates metal sintering, [20] but there is no obvious agglomeration or grain size increase was observed

from the TEM and HRTEM images after sintering at 700 °C due to the conductive carrier of CNBs that restricts the size of the nanoparticles.[\[23\]](#page-9-0) Further investigation of the morphologies of CNBs, Pt3Co/CNBs, and B-Pt3Co/CNBs revealed that the TEM images of both CNBs and Pt3Co/CNBs showed the same bowl-like structure with similar size and dispersion as that of B-Pt3Co/CNBs, which confirmed the structural stability of the carbon nanobowls (Figures S2,S4, Supporting Information). As shown in Figures [2e,f,](#page-2-0) the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) HRTEM plots show the plane spacing of B-Pt3Co/CNBs are 0.279, 0.225, and 0.187 nm, corresponding to the (110), (111), and (200) planes of Pt3Co, respectively. Moreover, after careful calculation, the lattice spacing values of B-Pt3Co/CNBs are slightly larger than those of Pt3Co/CNBs (Figure S5, Supporting Information), indicating that boron atoms have been successfully doped into the Pt3Co lattice and the original lattice spacing of Pt-Co has been expanded, which is consistent with the results of XRD analysis. The structure of B-Pt3Co/CNBs was further analyzed from the atomic scale using high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM). From the HADDF-STEM and fast Fourier transform (FFT) plots in Figures [2g,h](#page-2-0) it can be seen that the Pt and Co atoms exhibit different contrasts, in which the Pt atoms are brightly colored and the Co atoms are darkly colored (the B element is difficult to observe from this because of its small atomic size and low doping content). Chemically ordered Pt3Co nanoparticles in the [110] direction are also shown in Figure [2i.](#page-2-0) In the [110] direction, the chemically ordered L12 structures appear as a layer-by-layer structure.[\[24\]](#page-9-0) Elemental mapping with energy dispersive X-rays (EDS) shows a homogeneous distribution of the various elements, and at the same time goes one step further to provide strong evidence for successful B doping (Figure [2j\)](#page-2-0).

The degree of graphitization of the B-Pt3Co/CNBs was further investigated by Raman spectroscopy, in which the disorder and crystallinity of the sp<sup>2</sup> carbon material were shown by the D (1345 cm<sup>−</sup>1) and G (1590 cm<sup>−</sup>1) bands, respectively. As shown in **Figure 3**a, the ID/IG ratios of B-Pt3Co/CNBs and CNBs are 0.81 and 0.78, respectively, indicating that the carbon carriers of B-Pt3Co/CNBs exhibit the same graphitic structure as CNBs. Additionally, the porous structures of B-Pt3Co/CNBs and CNBs were further evaluated by N2 adsorption experiments, showing a surface area of 455.64 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> and total pore volume of 0.49 cm<sup>3</sup> g<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> for B-Pt3Co/CNBs (Figure S6, Supporting Information), which are similar to that of pure CNBs (542.58 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> and 0.20 cm<sup>3</sup> g<sup>−</sup>1) (Figure S7, Supporting Information). The above results suggest that the loading of B-Pt3Co nanoparticles does not affect the structure and permanent porosity of the carbon structure. This is conducive to improving the electrical conductivity of the catalysts, which is consistent with the XRD results. The chemical states and compositions of the B-Pt3Co/CNBs and other control samples were further investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to analyze the electronic effects of the doping of B atoms into the PtCo NPs. The XPS survey spectra (Figures S8–S10, Supporting Information) showed the presence of Co, Pt, B, and C in the samples, which further confirmed the successful doping of B atoms in B-Pt3Co/CNBs. From the Pt 4f XPS spectrum of B-Pt3Co/CNBs, it can be observed that the components of 71.8 and 75.2 eV are attributed to the 4f7/2 and 4f5/2 of Pt0, while the components of 72.4 and 75.8 eV are attributed to the Pt<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup>, with a self-selected orbital splitting peak of 3.4 eV.[\[25\]](#page-9-0) Notably, the comparison reveals that the binding energy of Pt 3d of B-Pt3Co/CNBs is positively shifted by 0.2 eV compared to that of Pt3Co/CNBs (Figure 3b). It suggests that the doping of B atoms modulates the electronic structure of Pt, in which the electrons of Pt are transferred to B and cause the d-band center to shift negatively to the Fermi energy level, leading to the

reduction of the adsorption energy of ORR intermediates to promote the desorption of oxygen-containing substances. The XPS spectrum of Co 2p (Figure 3c) shows that the binding energy of Co in B-Pt<sub>3</sub>Co/CNBs displays a slight positive shift (0.1 eV) compared with that of Pt<sub>3</sub>Co/CNBs, suggesting that B also affects the electronic structure of Co. However, the effect of B-atom doping on Pt is significantly more pronounced than that of Co, which further explains why Pt plays a dominant catalytic role in the whole reaction process. Figure 3d shows the XPS spectra of B 1s, where the Pt<sub>3</sub>Co nanoparticles dispersed on the CNBs were doped with only ≈6 at. % of B (Table S1, Supporting Information), which is close to the test limit of the instrument. However, the characteristic peaks belonging to metallic B observed at 187.3 eV can still be observed, while the corresponding peaks at 190.9 and 193.3 eV can be attributed to the peaks in different oxidation states due to the unavoidable oxidation of the surface-exposed B upon contact with oxygen.

Moreover, the ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) test was performed to further verify the regulation effect of B doping on the electronic structure of Pt<sub>3</sub>Co. From the UPS cutoff energy (E<sub>cutoff</sub>) spectra, the E<sub>cutoff</sub> of B-Pt<sub>3</sub>Co/CNBs and Pt<sub>3</sub>Co/CNBs are 16.81 and 16.76 eV, respectively (Figure 3e,f). According to the formula ( $\Phi$  = 21.22 eV -  $E_{cutoff}$  -  $E_{f}$ ), the work functions of the two are 4.41 and 4.46 eV, respectively. This result indicates that B doping reduces the work function of the catalyst by 0.05 eV. The reduction in the work function means that the surface active sites of B-Pt<sub>3</sub>Co/CNBs have a stronger electron supply capacity, which is more conducive to electron exchange with oxygen-containing intermediates during the ORR process, consistent with the theoretical calculation conclusion that B atoms accept electrons from Pt/Co through empty orbitals, reducing the charge density of metal sites (Figure 5f). The valence band spectrum analysis shows that the valence band maximum (VBM) of B-Pt<sub>3</sub>Co/CNBs is located at 3.95 eV from the Fermi level, while that of Pt<sub>3</sub>Co/CNBs is at 3.78 eV (Figure 3e,f). The VBM has shifted negatively by 0.17 eV toward the Fermi level, proving that B doping causes a change in the energy level structure of the catalyst, resulting in a redistribution of electrons. This phenomenon is consistent with the fellow theoretical calculation that the d-band center of B-Pt<sub>3</sub>Co/CNBs shifts, indicating that B doping achieves electronic delocalization at Pt/Co sites. Combining the UPS and XPS characterization results forms a complete evidence system: the Pt 3d orbital binding energy in B-Pt<sub>3</sub>Co/CNBs exhibits a 0.2 eV positive shift, which reflects an increase in electron binding energy. This phenomenon is consistent with the UPS test revealing a decrease in the work function (enhanced surface electron supply capacity) and the valence band maximum shifting toward the Fermi level (energy level structure reconstruction), jointly confirming the electronic state modulation effect caused by B doping. This regulation mechanism is due to the charge redistribution caused by the electronegativity difference of the B atoms. It can be seen that the regulation of the electronic structure of Pt by B doping presents multidimensional characteristics, not only reflected in the slight shift of core level binding energy but also confirmed through the overall energy level reconstruction, i.e., the movement of VBM, the change in electron supply capacity, and the work function, fully demonstrating the modulation effect of B on the electronic structure of Pt<sub>3</sub>Co/CNBs.

#### 2.2. Electrochemical Activity Evaluation

In order to evaluate the effect of B doping on the ORR performance of PtCo alloys, the electrochemical properties of B-Pt<sub>3</sub>Co/CNBs, Pt<sub>3</sub>Co/CNBs, and CNBs were measured in 0.1 м KOH with commercial Pt/C (40%) as a benchmark. The CV plots show that, compared with the characteristic featureless CV curves collected in the N2-saturated electrolyte, each sample in the O2-saturated electrolyte showed distinct reduction peaks (Figure 4a; Figure S11, Supporting Information). Among them, the reduction peak of B-Pt<sub>3</sub>Co/CNBs appeared earlier at 0.866 V versus RHE, which was higher than that of Pt<sub>3</sub>Co/CNBs (0.790 V vs RHE), CNBs (0.690 V vs RHE), and Pt/C (0.836 V vs RHE), suggesting that the doping of B-atoms and structural ordering may be the reason for improving the ORR activity. As shown in Figure 4b and Figure S12 (Supporting Information), the B-Pt<sub>3</sub>Co/CNBs exhibited excellent ORR performance with a half-wave potential ( $E_{1/2}$ ) of  $\approx 0.985$  V versus RHE, which was superior to that of Pt<sub>3</sub>Co/CNBs (0.938 V vs RHE), CNBs (0.712 V vs RHE), and Pt/C (0.968 V vs RHE), confirming that the introduction of B was extremely promotive to the ORR activity of the catalyst. In addition, as can be seen in Figure 4c, the Tafel slope of B-Pt<sub>3</sub>Co/CNBs is 63.2 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>, which is close to that of commercial Pt/C (62.1 mV dec-1) and lower than that of the other comparison samples, suggesting faster ORR kinetics on B-Pt<sub>3</sub>Co/CNBs. In addition, the kinetic current densities (I<sub>V</sub>) at 0.9 and 0.85 V versus RHE (5.47 and 5.63 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>) of B-Pt<sub>3</sub>Co/CNBs are higher than those of the commercial Pt/C and other comparative samples (Figure S13 and Table S2, Supporting Information). To further verify the conductivity and interfacial charge transfer rate, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements were performed on the prepared catalysts. As shown in Figure S14 (Supporting Information), an equivalent circuit model is also provided, where R<sub>c</sub> and R<sub>ct</sub> represent the solution resistance and charge transfer resistance, respectively, and CPE is the double-layer capacitor from the catalyst/carrier and catalyst solution. From the Nyquist plots, it can be seen that the B-Pt<sub>3</sub>Co/CNBs have the smallest charge transfer resistance, which proves their excellent ORR performance. This result confirms the effective penetration of B-Pt<sub>2</sub>Co/CNBs into the reactants, the faster reaction kinetics, and the excellent ORR activity. To further understand the activity of B-Pt<sub>3</sub>Co/CNBs catalysts, the specific activities (SA) at 0.9 and 0.85 V versus RHE were further obtained based on the underpotential deposited hydrogen (H<sub>IIPD</sub>) estimated ECSA (Figure \$15, Supporting Information). The specific activities of B-Pt<sub>3</sub>Co/CNBs were determined to be 5.96 and 6.88 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> at 0.85 and 0.9 V versus RHE, respectively, which were 34.9 and 11.6 times higher than those of Pt/C (0.171 and 0.594 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>) and Pt<sub>3</sub>Co/CNBs (0.386 and 1.339 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>) by a factor of 15.3 and 5.1, suggesting that B-Pt<sub>3</sub>Co/CNBs have higher intrinsic ORR activity (Figure \$16, Supporting Information). In addition, mass activities (MA) was calculated and compared in Figure S17 (Supporting Information) to confirm the stronger intrinsic activity of B-Pt<sub>3</sub>Co/CNBs. The results show that B-Pt $_3\text{Co}/\text{CNBs}$  (0.216 and 0.250 A  $\text{mg}^{-1}_{\text{Pt}}) > \text{Pt}/\text{C}$  (0.012 and 0.065 A  $mg^{-1}_{Pt}$ ) > B-Pt<sub>3</sub>Co/CNBs (0.005 A  $mg^{-1}_{Pt}$  and 0.016 A mg<sup>-1</sup><sub>Pt</sub>) under the conditions of 0.85 and 0.9 V versus RHE, indicating that B-Pt<sub>3</sub>Co/CNBs display the best intrinsic activity,

superior to that of Pt/C and Pt3Co/CNBs (Table S3, Supporting Information).

Stability is an important indicator for evaluating catalyst performance. As shown in Figure 4d and Figure S18 (Supporting Information), the LSV curves of B-Pt3Co/CNBs show only a 9 mV negative shift after 50 000 cycles in 0.1 M KOH, which is significantly lower than those of commercial Pt/C. In addition, a long-term test on the catalyst samples was also performed, and the results indicated that the current densities of B-Pt3Co/CNBs were almost unchanged after 125 h of stability test, while that of commercial Pt/C decreased by 77.31% (Figure 4e). The above series of results indicates that the B-Pt3Co/CNBs show excellent cycling stability, which is attributed to the combined effect of atomic ordering and B-doped in B-Pt3Co/CNBs. In addition, the morphological structure of the B-Pt3Co/CNBs samples and CNBs after cycling was examined (Figures S19–S21, Supporting Information), and the TEM and SEM examination showed that the nanoparticle size and dispersion remained almost unchanged, and the bowl-shaped carbon materials maintained well due to the interconnected hierarchical mesoporous network that can effectively buffer volume strain stress during electrochemical cycling, which further confirmed the long-time stability of B-Pt3Co/CNBs.

To further investigate the ORR mechanism, we tested the LSV curves of B-Pt3Co/CNBs at different rotational rates (Figure 4f), and the associated Koutechy–Levich (K-L) diagram is shown in Figure 4g. It is clearly observed that the limited diffusion current density of B-Pt3Co/CNBs is proportional to rotational rates as the diffusion distance is shortened. Moreover, it was calculated that the K-L curve showed a good linear relationship with the

increase of potential, and the electron transfer number (n) was about 4.0, indicating the existence of the first-order reaction kinetics of the direct 4e-transfer mechanism in the ORR process. Finally, the intermediate products (H2O2) were also evaluated using a rotating ring disc electrode (RRDE) (Figure S22, Supporting Information). As shown in Figure [4h,](#page-5-0) the yield of H2O2 was less than 5%, which is better than that of Pt/C. Meanwhile, the corresponding n was greater than 3.9, which is in agreement with the calculation of the K-L diagram and further validates the 4e<sup>−</sup> transfer pathway of B-Pt3Co/CNBs. In the practical application of catalysts, in addition to activity and durability, the resistance of the sample to contamination is also very important. Methanol tolerance tests of B-Pt3Co/CNBs, Pt3Co/CNBs, and Pt/C were performed by adding a methanol solution in 0.1 M KOH. As shown in Figure [4i,](#page-5-0) the current density of the B-Pt3Co/CNBs samples did not change significantly after the addition of methanol, while the current densities of Pt3Co/CNBs and Pt/C, especially Pt/C, decreased to a large extent. The results indicate that B-Pt3Co/CNBs demonstrate advanced methanol tolerance, which further increases the potential of B-Pt3Co/CNBs for practical applications.

### **2.3. Theoretical Calculation**

To investigate the effect of interstitial B on the activity and stability of Pt3Co/CNBs, the ORR mechanism of B interstitial doped B-Pt3Co/CNBs in alkaline environments was investigated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations (**Figure 5**a; Figure S23a, Supporting Information). It is well known that lower oxygen binding energy can accelerate the deprotonation process and advance the reaction rate-limiting step of ORR, in which the desorption of oxygen-containing intermediates achieved by lower energy can advance the process of ORR reaction. The oxygen binding energies of the Pt and Co sites of B-Pt3Co/CNBs and Pt3Co/CNBs were calculated separately, and the results showed that the oxygen adsorption energy of the Pt site was lower than that of the Co site, indicating the Pt site, as the main active site, played a powerful role in promoting the ORR process (Figure 5b). It indicates that the introduction of B can effectively drive the reaction rate-limiting step and enhance the ORR activity.

Based on the results of the above analysis of the surface oxygen adsorption energy, the Gibbs free energy changes of B-Pt3Co/CNBs and Pt3Co/CNBs were calculated for voltage

conditions of 0 and 1.23 V versus RHE. As shown in Figure [5c](#page-6-0) and Figure S24 (Supporting Information) at zero electrode potential (U = 0 V vs RHE), the electron transfer steps are all spontaneously exothermic. At an operating voltage of U = 1.23 V versus RHE, the conversion of \*OOH to \*O, and \*O to \*OH at the Pt3Co/CNBs sites is exothermic, indicating thermodynamic spontaneity. However, the hydrogenation of \*O2 to \*OOH and \*OH is heat-absorbing, especially the reduction of adsorbed O2 molecules (\*O2) to \*OOH with an energy barrier of +0.91 eV, suggesting strong adsorption energies of the active site to the O-containing intermediates, which is the rate-determining step (RDS) in the catalytic reaction pathway of Pt3Co/CNBs. In contrast, after B doping, the energy barrier for the reduction of O2 molecules to \*OOH in the sites of B-Pt3Co/CNBs was reduced to -0.88 eV, and its RDS (\*O→\*OH) energy barrier (0.39 eV) was significantly lower than that of Pt3Co/CNBs, indicating that the interstitial doping of B promotes the transformation process of the oxygen-containing intermediate, which is conducive to the acceleration of the rate-limiting step of the ORR process.

The total density of states (DOS) and projected density of states (PDOS) results further clarify the role of B atoms in interstitial doping in the catalyst samples. The DOS from Figure [5d](#page-6-0) and Figure S25 (Supporting Information) shows that the dband center of B-Pt3Co/CNBs is negatively shifted compared to Pt3Co/CNBs, indicating that the introduction of B atoms weakens the adsorption of oxygen-containing intermediates on the surface active sites. Simultaneously, the PDOS results show a negative shift d-band center of the Pt and Co active sites in the B-Pt3Co/CNBs compared to Pt3Co/CNBs, which can be attributed to the hybridisation of Pt 4f orbitals and Co 3d orbitals of with B 2p orbitals, leading to the occupation of the empty orbitals of B by electrons from Pt and Co that can trigger the reduction of the charge density of the Pt and Co metal sites (Figure [5e;](#page-6-0) Figure S26, Supporting Information). To further understand the effect of B doping on the electronic structure of the catalysts, the differential charges of B-Pt3Co/CNBs and Pt3Co/CNBs have been calculated. As shown in Figure [5f](#page-6-0) and Figure S23b (Supporting Information), the charge densities between the nanoparticles and the carriers in B-Pt3Co/CNBs were mainly accumulated on the B atoms, whereas the charge densities of Pt3Co/CNBs were mainly dispersed near the Pt and Co atoms. This may be due to the transfer of electrons from Pt and Co atoms to B atoms, which not only results in a positive shift in XPS binding energy but also decreases the overall work function, resulting in a decrease in the d-band electron filling of Pt and Co. Those results ultimately optimize the adsorption energy of intermediates through the modulation of the d-band center. The rearrangement of charges resulted in the formation of special charge channels between Pt, Co, and B, which accelerated the charge exchange between nonmetallic B and metallic Pt and Co, and at the same time shifted the d-band center of Pt3Co/CNBs negatively, which effectively promoted the ORR reaction process. The weak interaction between Pt and Co atoms in Pt3Co, especially the strong solubility of Co atoms, leads to their poor stability, while after interstitial doping of B in Pt3Co, the separation energy of Co in B-Pt3Co/CNBs is 1.88 eV, which is higher than that of Pt3Co/CNBs (1.72 eV) (Figure [5g\)](#page-6-0). The enhancement of the atomic dissociation energy indicates that the interstitial doping of B leads to the enhancement of the interactions between B and Co atoms as well as between B and Pt atoms, which can effectively inhibit the dissolution of Co and enhance the stability of the alloy structure, which is also the reason for the strong stability of the electrocatalytic cycle of B-Pt3Co/CNBs. The above-optimized structures indicate that the doping of B atoms in the lattice results in low oxygen adsorption energy, an efficient reaction rate-limiting step, and strong structural stability, which not only effectively enhances the desorption of oxygen-containing intermediates but also makes a significant contribution to the stability of their long-time operation.

### **2.4. Application Potential in Zinc-Air Battery**

The excellent ORR activity offers great potential for the application of B-Pt3Co/CNBs in Zinc-air batteries (ZABs). In this work, <span id="page-8-0"></span>**[www.advancedsciencenews.com](http://www.advancedsciencenews.com) [www.advenergymat.de](http://www.advenergymat.de)**

zinc-air batteries were assembled using 0.5 mm zinc flakes as the anode, B-Pt3Co/CNBs, carbon black, and tetrafluoroethylene binder pressed into nickel foam as the air cathode, and a mixture of 6 M KOH, 0.2 M zinc acetate as the electrolyte to evaluate the potential of its practical application. ZABs assembled under the same conditions using Pt/C as the cathode were also used for comparison (**Figure 6**[a\)](#page-7-0). As shown in Figure [6b,](#page-7-0) the open-circuit voltage with B-Pt3Co/CNBs as the cathode is 1.426 V versus RHE, which is higher than the open-circuit voltage of the ZAB using Pt/C (1.413 V vs RHE). From the associated discharge polarisation and power density curves, it can be seen that the B-Pt3Co/CNBs have a higher discharge voltage at the same current density, and the peak power density of the ZAB with B-Pt3Co/CNBs (109 mW cm<sup>−</sup>2) is also considerably better than that of the ZAB using Pt/C (88 mW cm<sup>−</sup>2) (Figure [6c\)](#page-7-0). In addition, the ZAB constructed with B-Pt3Co/CNBs had similar discharge behavior with respect to the discharge voltage, especially with a higher specific capacitance (727 mAh g<sup>−</sup>1) compared to Pt/C, which had a specific capacitance of 685 mAh g<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> under the same load (Figure [6d\)](#page-7-0). In order to evaluate the durability of ZAB based on B-Pt3Co/CNBs, continuous constantcurrent discharge–charge tests were performed at a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> (Figure [6e\)](#page-7-0). The results showed that the B-Pt3Co/CNBs-catalysed ZAB had a small charging-discharging voltage gap under cycling up to 880 h, which demonstrated the excellent cycling stability of B-Pt3Co/CNBs and its potential for ZAB application. The above results indicate that the ORR activity, stability, and utilization potential of ZAB prepared with B-Pt3Co/CNBs as an air cathode are excellent.

# **3. Conclusion**

In this work, we successfully developed ordered B-Pt3Co with gap-doped B on regular carbon nanobowl substrates and achieved excellent catalytic activity with long-lasting stability. The obtained B-Pt3Co/CNBs exhibit a superior ORR performance with a half-wave potential of 0.985 V versus RHE. The current density only decreased by 9 mV after 50 000 CV cycles, and the attenuation of current density was almost negligible even under the long-time stability test of 125 h. The ZAB assembled as an air cathode in practical applications shows a peak power density of 125 mW cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> with a specific capacity of 727 mAh g<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> Zn and can be cycled for more than 880 h. Experimental and theoretical calculations have verified that the gap B atoms play the role of a "structure binder" to drive the Pt3Co. The doping of B atoms not only reduces the oxygen adsorption energy at the catalyst sites and accelerates the rate-limiting step but also optimizes the electronic structure, decreases the d-band center, and even improves the bonding energy between Co and B atoms, which can effectively inhibit the dissolution of Co during the ORR process.

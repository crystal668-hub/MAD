# **Pyridinic-N Protected Synthesis of 3D Nitrogen-Doped Porous Carbon with Increased Mesoporous Defects for Oxygen Reduction**

*Jin Luo, Kangjun Wang, Xing Hua, Wang Wang, Jun Li, Shiming Zhang,\* and Shengli Chen\**

**Nitrogen (N)-doped carbons are potential nonprecious metal catalysts to replace Pt for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Pyridinic-N-C is believed to be the most active N group for catalyzing ORR. In this work, using zinc phthalocyanine as a precursor effectively overcomes the serious loss of pyridinic-N, which is commonly regarded as the biggest obstacle to catalytic performance enhancement upon adopting a second pyrolysis process, for the preparation of a 3D porous N-doped carbon framework (NDCF). The results show only ≈14% loss in pyridinic-N proportion in the Zn-containing sample during the second pyrolysis process. In comparison, a loss of ≈72% pyridinic-N occurs for the non-Zn counterpart. The high pyridinic-N proportion, the porous carbon framework produced upon NaCl removal, and the increased mesoporous defects in the second pyrolysis process make the asprepared catalyst an excellent electrocatalyst for ORR, exhibiting a half-wave potential (***E***1/2 = 0.88 V) up to 33 mV superior to state-of-the-art Pt/C and high four-electron selectivity (***n* **> 3.83) in alkaline solution, which is among the best ORR activities reported for N-doped carbon catalysts. Furthermore, only ≈18 mV degradation in** *E***1/2 occurs after an 8000 cycles' accelerating stability test, manifesting the outstanding stability of the asprepared catalyst.**

environment problems related to the fossil fuels.[1,2] However, the scarcity of Pt and its sluggish kinetics for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) greatly impede the development of fuel cells.[3–5] Therefore, enormous efforts have been devoted to search for the non-noble metal electrocatalysts, and nitrogen (N)-doped carbons have been considered as one of the most promising candidates.[6–10]

For the synthesis of N-doped carbons, it has been a general method by high temperature (HT) pyrolysis of N-containing compounds (e.g., urea, melamine) or polymers (PANI, etc.) in an inert atmosphere.[11–15] Usually, the synthesis process involves a double pyrolysis procedure. In the first-time pyrolysis, a variety of N-species, such as pyridinic-N, pyrrolic-N, graphitic-N, etc., could be produced, generally along with the metal-species, such as oxides, carbides, nitrides, etc.[16–19] Then, acid leaching is employed to remove the unstable species, undesired functional groups and other impurities.

Unfortunately, introducing acid would largely block the active sites.[20,21] Still, it should be noted that N-doping can introduce the ORR sites and the foreign N can induce charge redistribution in carbon framework and significantly increase the density of states at the Fermi level of the adjacent C atoms, thus facilitating the adsorption and reduction of O2 molecules.[11,12,22] As a matter of course, a second-time pyrolysis is necessarily conducted to eliminate the damage caused by acid leaching and regulate the pore structures for the high exposure of active sites.[20,23] Among the various N-species, pyridinic-N has stood out from the various N-species. It creates the active sites and that is carbon atoms next to pyridinic-N (pyridinic-N-C) can be the active sites for ORR in the recent report.[24] However, pyridinic-N groups are unstable at the high temperatures. It could easily decompose into volatile fragments and transform into more stable graphitic-N, resulting in the severe attenuation of the catalytic performance.[25–27] So, during the second-time HT pyrolysis, the significant loss of the highly active pyridinic-N sites seriously impeded the catalytic performance enhancement. Hence, it should be very vital to preserve even increase the pyridinic-N-C sites during the HT pyrolysis process to

obtain high performance N-doped carbons electrocatalysts for ORR. Generally, this can be realized by regulating the pore structure,[20,21] increasing the surface area,[28–30] improving the sites dispersion,[31–33] bonding with the metals (Fe, Co, Ni, Zn, Mn, etc.),[34–38] and so on.

Herein, we show that using zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc) as the sole precursor can significantly inhibit the loss of pyridinic-N groups in the second pyrolysis process. The relatively strong Zn-N interaction inheriting from the ZnPc percursor has achieved the well dispersion of Zn in the N-doped carbon matrix, efficiently protecting the pyridinic-N groups during the second pyrolysis. Combing with the more exposed active sites (increment of mesopores) by the second pyrolysis and the use of NaCl crystallites as template for producing macropores, we have managed to synthesize hierarchic porous framework of N-doped carbon, exhibiting a half potential (*E*1/2 = 0.88 V) value, which, as far as we know, should be among the most positive one reported so far for nonmetal N-doped carbon catalyst.

# **2. Results and Discussion**

The synthetic route of NDCF is illustrated in **Figure 1**. NaCl crystallites are excellent template for preparing porous carbon framework, as well as promoting the graphitization of the carbon framework.[16,17,39] ZnPc (or H2Pc) powders were firstly dispersed in ethanol and the saturated NaCl aqueous solution was then added. Due to the insolubility of NaCl in ethanol, it can immediately precipitate and form sub-microscale cubic crystals (Figure S1, Supporting Information) through the fast crystallization process. And, the formed NaCl crystallites can act as the templates for the growth of NDCF catalysts. In our system, choosing ZnPc and H2Pc as the precursors, we introduce a double HT pyrolysis process (Figure 1). For clarity, the first pyrolysis products were denoted as NDCF(Zn)-H1 and NDCF(H)-H1, and the corresponding second pyrolysis products were denoted as NDCF(Zn)-H2 and NDCF(H)-H2, respectively. Firstly, the morphology of samples was characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As reflected from SEM (**Figure 2**a,c and Figure S2a,c, Supporting Information), all the samples show a similar 3D interconnected sheets structure with abundant micrometer-scale cavities, which is expected to favor the mass transfer during the catalytic reaction.[16] Furthermore, the thin graphene sheets with mono/few-layer can be seen in the TEM images (Figure 2b,d and Figure S2b,d, Supporting Information), which can provide enough surface area for the active dopants. These results foreboded that NaCl crystal template should be a good tool for the growth of high performance N-doped carbons. Clearly read the TEM image in Figure 2b, there are a small amount of nanoparticles dispersed on the graphene sheets, which are surrounded by thin-layered carbon with a diameter of around 6 nm. From the high resolution TEM images (Figure S3, Supporting Information), the lattice fringes with a d-spacing of 0.281, 0.247, and 0.148 nm are corresponding to the (100), (101), and (103) planes of ZnO, respectively, suggesting that ZnO nanoparticles form in the preparation process of NDCF(Zn)-H1. Interestingly, after the twice-calcination for NDCF(Zn)-H2, the nanoparticles are disappeared in Figure 2d. This phenomenon could be ascribed to the reduction of ZnO to Zn and subsequently evaporation during the second pyrolysis process of 950 °C. Furthermore, the X-ray diffraction (XRD) results of the prepared samples have been shown in Figure 2e. There are only the dominant C(002) diffraction peak at 2θ value of around 25° in NDCF(H)- H1 and NDCF(H)-H2. However, apart from the broad C(002) peak, the XRD patterns of NDCF(Zn)-H1 exhibits the characteristic peaks of ZnO at ≈31.6°, ≈36.3°, and ≈62.8° (JCPDS card: no. 36-1451). Through the second HT pyrolysis, the peaks of ZnO are disappeared and no peaks of metallic Zn are observed in the resulted NDCF(Zn)-H2.

The surface area and porous nature of the samples were examined by conducting Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) gas sorptometry measurements. As shown from N2 adsorption– desorption isotherms in **Figure 3**a, all the samples exhibit a type IV isotherm with a hysteresis loop, verifying the existence

of abundant mesopores.[40] Furthermore, by analyzing the pore-size distributions (Figure 3b), it can be seen the strong response of mesopores around 4 nm. Importantly, the responses of mesopores in NDCF(H)-H2 and NDCF(Zn)-H2 show the notable increase compared to those of NDCF(H)-H1 and NDCF(Zn)-H1, suggesting that the second pyrolysis

effectively induce the regulation of pore structure. Additionally, the increase of mesopores would be bound to result in the remarkable enlargement of BET surface area and total pore volume (Table S1, Supporting Information), which could be conducive to the exposure of active sites and the increment of mesoporous defects thus for the enhancement of ORR performance.[41–44]

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was conducted to gain further insight into the chemical elements and states of the as-prepared NDCF(H)-H1, NDCF(H)-H2, NDCF(Zn)-H1, and NDCF(Zn)-H2. The measured spectra display the presence of C, O, N, and Zn (Figure S4, Supporting Information) and the corresponding element contents have been listed in Table S2 in the Supporting Information. It can be seen that the second pyrolysis samples (0.94 at% for NDCF(H)- H2 and 2.43 at% for NDCF(Zn)-H2) show the lower N-doping than the first pyrolysis samples (4.02 at% for NDCF(H)-H1 and 5.77 at% for NDCF(Zn)-H1). The remarkable loss of the total N content (≈3 at%) should be ascribed to the decomposition of the unstable fragments for the evaporation of N.[45] Whereas, the Zn-containing samples give the higher N-doping than the non-Zn counterparts, suggesting that the presence of Zn can greatly retain N species. Zn has also been detected by XPS in the two NDCF(Zn)-H1 and NDCF(Zn)-H2 samples (Figure S4b, Supporting Information). As can be seen from the data in Table S2 in the Supporting Information, the surface content

> of Zn has a considerable loss from 0.26 at% in NDCF(Zn)-H1 to 0.14 at% in NDCF(Zn)-H2. We further performed inductively coupled plasma (ICP) tests for the two Zn-containing samples, and the total contents of Zn are found to be 2.7 and 0.7 wt%, respectively for NDCF(Zn)-H1 and NDCF(Zn)-H2 (Table S2, Supporting Information). The large difference of the measured Zn contents between XPS and ICP results should be ascribed to the existence of ZnO nanoparticles in the carbon framework of NDCF(Zn)-H1.

Furthermore, the high-resolution N1s spectra were shown in **Figure 4**a and respectively they can be deconvoluted into four peaks: 398 eV for pyridinic-N, 399.3 eV for pyrrolic-N, 400.6 eV for graphitic-N, and 402.5 eV for oxidized-N. It must be pointed out that Zn-N might be also included in the pyridinic-N peak because of the minuscule difference of the bonding energy.[46] The contents of the various N-species for the different samples were listed in Table S3 in the Supporting Information. Vividly, the proportions of each kind of N-species were also displayed in Figure 4b. At first glance, graphitic-N is prominent in all the samples, which is coincident with the previous results of N-species being prone to transform into the more stable graphitic-N in the HT pyrolysis.[26,27] And, it seems more meaningful because of the recent judgment that pyridinic-N-C has been verified as the most active site for ORR.[24]

Interestingly, after the second pyrolysis, the proportion of pyridinic-N only exhibits a tiny change of ≈14% from NDCF(Zn)-H1 (39.6%) to NDCF(Zn)- H2 (34.1%); while, the non-Zn counterpart undergoes a severe decline

**Figure 4.** a) High-resolution N1s XPS spectra and b) the proportion of each kind of N-species for the prepared samples.

**www.small-journal.com**

of ≈72% from NDCF(H)-H1 (36.3%) to NDCF(H)-H2 (10.2%). Besides, the considerably lowered binding energy of 2p3/2 (1021.5 eV) of Zn (Figure S3b, Supporting Information) as compared with the standard value of ZnO (1022 eV) might indicate the possible interaction between Zn and N.[34] Also, the SEM and TEM images as well as the XRD result have confirmed that there is no existence of the metallic Zn and ZnO nanoparticles in the secondary pyrolytic NDCF(Zn)-H2. Therefore, it would be reasonable that the probable Zn-N coordination should be ascribed to the selectively protected pyridinic-N in the Zn-containing samples during the second pyrolysis.

To assess the electrocatalytic activities of the catalysts, we first performed cyclic voltammetry (CV) in Ar- and O2-saturated electrolyte solution. As shown in **Figure 5**a, the prepared catalysts exhibit pronounced cathodic ORR peaks when the electrolyte is saturated with O2. The NDCF(Zn)-H2 gives the most positive reduction peak (≈0.81 V) in comparison with NDCF(Zn)-H1 (≈0.78 V), NDCF(H)-H2 (≈0.72 V) and NDCF(H)-H1 (≈0.73 V), showing the best ability to reduce O2. Additionally, Figure 5b shows the steady-state polarization curves for ORR catalytic activities of all the NDCF samples with commercial 20 wt% Pt/C as a reference, prior to which the same measurement was conducted in Ar-saturated electrolyte for background correction. For the two samples by the first HT pyrolysis, NDCF(H)-H1 and NDCF(Zn)-H1 exhibit almost the same ORR activities, which are inferior to that of Pt/C. Once going through the second HT pyrolysis, the ORR activities of NDCF(H)-H2 and NDCF(Zn)-H2 sharply boost (Figure 5b), although the N contents drastically decline (Table S2, Supporting Information). This phenomenon could be explained as the re-exposure of active sites and also the readjustment of pore structures after the secondary heating.[20,23] It is worth mentioning that in Figure 3b the mesopores of NDCF(H)-H2 and NDCF(Zn)-H2 have the appreciable increase compared with those of NDCF(H)-H1 and NDCF(Zn)-H1. So, it might be reasonable that the defects from the increased mesopores would make valuable contributions for the enhancement of ORR activities.[41,47]

Besides, we can find that NDCF(Zn)-H2 provides the higher ORR activity than NDCF(H)-H2. Because the two catalysts have the similar morphology (Figure 2 and Figure S2, Supporting Information) as well as BET surface area and pore features (Figure 2), the activity difference can only come from the chemical composition. By XPS results (Figure 4 and Table S2, Supporting Information), we know that the total N content of NDCF(Zn)-H2 (2.43 at%) is ≈2.5 times than that of NDCF(H)- H2 (0.94 at%). If only considering the pyridinic-N, the difference will be even greater. It should be ascribed to that only ≈14% loss in pyridinic-N proportion of the Zn-containing sample in comparison of ≈72% loss occurs for the non-Zn counterpart during the second pyrolysis process. That is to say, the existence of Zn can prevent pyridinic-N losing and the pyridinic-N protected can make a contribution for the ORR activity. Due to the introduction of Zn, the formed Zn-N*x* species especially Zn-N4 might be highly active for ORR in the recent report by Song et al.[34] Seriously, in comparison of H2Pc, we choose ZnPc with typical Zn-N4 structure as the target for the electrochemical analysis. As can be seen from Figure S5 in the Supporting Information, their ORR activities are all very

poor (Figure S5a, Supporting Information), and there is no obvious redox response in the CV curves of ZnPc and H2Pc even through dispersion with EC600 JD carbon (Figure S5b, Supporting Information), which is very different with those of FePc.[31] We believe that the ORR activity of NDCF(Zn)-H2 should be mainly created by pyridinic-N, and Zn should act as the anchors for the protection of pyridinic-N groups during the HT pyrolysis. Finally, NDCF(Zn)-H2 shows the highest catalytic activity (Figure 5b,c) for ORR with the onset potential (*E*on) of 1.01 V and the half-wave potential (*E*1/2) of 0.880 V, as comparing with NDCF(H)-H2 (*E*on = 0.98 V, *E*1/2 = 0.835 V), NDCF(Zn)-H1 (*E*on = 0.94 V, *E*1/2 = 0.818 V), and NDCF(H)-H1 (*E*on = 0.93 V, *E*1/2 = 0.814 V). Additionally, the ORR activity of NDCF(Zn)-H2 is superior to Pt/C (*E*on = 0.98 V, *E*1/2 = 0.847 V) and its kinetic current density (*j*k) at 0.8 V (vs RHE) is ≈2 times than that of Pt/C, which should be among the best ORR activities reported for N-doped carbon catalysts (Table S4, Supporting Information).

It has been believed that, among various N-species, the pyridinic-N is the most important one to activate the neighbor carbon atoms for ORR.[24] We attempt to explore the relationship of ORR activity and pyridinic-N content. It is not suitable for comparison of the samples between first pyrolysis and second pyrolysis; because the different pyrolysis processes can result in the great differences in sample properties such as the BET surface area, pore structure, chemical composition, defect, electronic conductivity, and so on. Therefore, it would be more reasonable to compare the second pyrolytic products (NDCF(H)-H2 and NDCF(Zn)-H2) for the possible relationship of ORR activity and pyridinic-N content, because they show the similar morphology (Figure 2 and Figure S2, Supporting Information) as well as BET surface area and pore features (Figure 2). The NDCF(Zn)-H2 exhibited much higher pyridinic-N content than that of NDCF(H)-H2 (0.83 vs 0.1 at%), which is in consistency with the much superior ORR activity of NDCF(Zn)-H2 to that of NDCF(H)-H2.

The rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) tests are further carried out. As depicted in Figure 5d, all the prepared catalysts show the similar electron transfer number (*n*) and H2O2 yield. By careful inspection, we can find that NDCF(Zn)-H1 and NDCF(Zn)-H2 give the higher *n* values along with the lower H2O2 yields than the corresponding to NDCF(H)-H1 and NDCF(H)-H2, respectively. This result suggests that the pyridinic-N contents might have a slight influence on the product selectivity during ORR. The high electron transfer number (*n* > 3.83) and the low H2O2 yield (<8%) at all potentials of NDCF(Zn)-H2 indicate its four-electron selectivity in comparison of Pt/C.

Electrochemical stability is deemed to be an important aspect for the ORR catalysts in application. To assess NDCF(Zn)-H2 with Pt/C as a reference, the tests are carried out by linearly sweeping in the range of 0.6–1.0 V in O2-saturated 0.1 m KOH solution. The polarization curves obtained before and after 8000 cycles have been shown in **Figure 6**. The NDCF(Zn)-H2 catalyst shows only 18 mV negative shift in *E*1/2 before and after the stability test, which is superior to that of Pt/C (60 mV negative shift in *E*1/2). This result highlights the outstanding long-term stability of NDCF(Zn)-H2.

## **3. Conclusion**

A 3D N-doped carbon framework (NDCF) is synthesized through a double pyrolytic process with ZnPc as precursor and NaCl crystallites as templates. The existence of Zn selectively protects the most active center (pyridinic-N-C) for ORR during the second pyrolysis process. Meanwhile, the remove of NaCl template creates porous framework and the second pyrolysis process increases the mesoporous defects. Hence, the obtained NDCF shows excellent electrocatalytic performance for ORR, exhibiting a half-wave potential (*E*1/2 = 0.88 V) up to a 33 mV more positive to the state-of-the-art Pt/C catalyst in alkaline solution, high fourelectron selectivity (*n* > 3.83) and excellent stability (only ≈18 mV degradation in *E*1/2) after 8000 cycles' accelerating test, which outperforms most of the nitrogen-doped carbons.

## **4. Experiment Section**

*Materials Preparation*: The samples were prepared via pyrolysis of a homogeneous mixture consisting of ZnPc and NaCl. In a typical procedure, ZnPc (400 mg) was ultrasonically dispersed into ethanol (240 mL) followed by rapidly adding 5 mL aqueous solution containing 1600 mg NaCl. Then, the mixture was vigorously stirred under 80 °C until getting a light blue powder, which was subsequently subjected to a thermal activation at 900 °C under Ar flow for 1 h in a tube furnace.

www.small-journal.com

After cooling to room temperature, the obtained product was soaked in 0.5  $\,\rm M$   $\,H_2SO_4$  at 80  $^{\circ}C$  for 12 h followed by repeated washing with hot water. After that, the as-prepared sample was lyophilized to get the black solid product denoted as NDCF(Zn)-H1. To this end, NDCF(Zn)-H1 was further calcined at 950  $^{\circ}C$  under Ar for 1 h to obtain the ultima product denoted as NDCF(Zn)-H2. For comparison, the procedure was conducted under the same condition except for substituting ZnPc with  $H_2Pc$  to obtain NDCF(H)-H1 and NDCF(H)-H2, respectively.

Structure and Morphology Characterization: Powder XRD measurements were carried out using a Rigaku SmartLab powder diffractometer with a Cu  $K\alpha$  radiation source to identify the crystal phases of each sample. The morphology of samples was obtained with an SEM (Zeiss Sigma) and TEM (JEM-2100). The XPS analyses were conducted on a Kratos Ltd XSAM-800 spectrometer. The N<sub>2</sub> adsorption–desorption isotherms were recorded by an ASAP2020 Surface Area and Porosity Analyzer (Micromeritics, USA). The ICP test was conducted on the PerkinElmer NexION 350D ICP-MS.

Electrochemical Measurements: All the electrochemical measurements of the as-prepared samples were performed on a CHI electrochemical workstation (CHI 900b) in a conventional three-electrode cell with a Pt foil as the counter electrode, and an Hg/HgO electrode in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte as the reference electrode. The working electrode was prepared by dispersing 5 mg as-prepared catalyst in 1 mL of 0.1 wt% Nafion isopropanol solution by sonication and drop-casting 24 µL of the above ink onto the glass carbon (GC) disk electrode (5 mm diameter), resulting in a total loading of 600  $\mu g$  cm<sup>-2</sup>. For comparison, 20 wt% Pt/C catalysts (Johnson Matthey) were prepared in a similar way with a loading of 15  $\mu g_{Pt}$  cm<sup>-2</sup>. All the measured potentials were converted to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) by calibrating the equilibrium potential of the Hg/HgO electrode to the RHE scale in the hydrogensaturated electrolyte with a Pt/C-loaded GC electrode as the working electrode. The steady-state polarization curve was performed with an electrode rotating speed of 1600 rpm and a scanning rate of 5 mV s<sup>-1</sup> in O2-saturated solution of 0.1 M KOH, and cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed with a potential scanning rate of 50 mV s<sup>-1</sup> in both O<sub>2</sub>- and Ar-saturated electrolytes.

The kinetic current density  $(j_k)$ , which describes the intrinsic catalytic activity of the catalyst at a certain potential, was calculated from the mass-transport correction based on the Koutecký–Levich equation:

$$j_{k} = \frac{j \times j_{L}}{j_{L} - j} \tag{1}$$

where j and  $j_L$  are the measured current density and diffusion-limiting current density on the polarization curve, respectively.

The RRDE tests were executed with a ring electrode potential of 1.3 V versus RHE. The  $H_2O_2$  yield and the effective electron-transfer number (n) of ORR were determined by the following equations:

$$H_2O_2$$
 (%) = 200 ×  $\frac{I_R/N}{(I_R/N) + I_D}$  (2)

$$n = 4 \times \frac{I_D}{(I_P/N) + I_D} \tag{3}$$

where  $I_R$  and  $I_D$  are the ring and disk currents, respectively; N is the ring collecting efficiency of the Pt ring, which was calibrated to be 0.241 using 10 m M K<sub>3</sub>[Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub>] in 0.1 M KNO<sub>3</sub>.

The accelerated stability tests were performed in the  $O_2$ -saturated 0.1 M KOH electrolytes at room temperature by cycling the potential between 0.6 and 1.0 V versus RHE at a potential scanning rate of 50 mV s<sup>-1</sup>.

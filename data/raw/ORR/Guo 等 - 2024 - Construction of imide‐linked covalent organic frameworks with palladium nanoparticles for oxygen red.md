#### **Abstract**

Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have been widely employed as electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) due to their diverse and tunable skeletons and pores. However, their electrocatalytic activity was limited due to the lack of highly active catalytic sites. In this work, we have first immobilized palladium nanoparticles (NPs) into the crystal, porous, and stable imide‐ linked COF for ORR. The newly designed COF had pyridine linkers with imide‐linkages in the frameworks serving as the binding sites to anchor Pd sites, and the high surface area and open pore channels provide fast mass transport pathway to the active Pd sites, which contributed highly active performance in ORR. And the designed catalyst delivered onset potential and the half‐wave potential of COF‐Pd of 0.97 and 0.83 V, with a limited current density of 6.1 mA cm−<sup>2</sup> , respectively. This work provides us insights into developing high crystalline COFs with metal NPs in electrocatalytic systems.

## **1** <sup>|</sup> **INTRODUCTION**

Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are a class of porous crystalline polymers, which are made up of different building units connected by covalent bonds[.1–5](#page-8-0) Various COFs with different skeletons, porosities and topologies have been developed to explore their properties and functions, such as gas uptakes,[6,7](#page-8-0) water harvesting,[8,9](#page-8-0) chemical sensor[,10,11](#page-8-0) proton/lithium‐ion conduction[,12,13](#page-8-0) photocatalysis,[14,15](#page-8-0) and electrocatalysis.[16,17](#page-8-0) Particularly, COFs

<span id="page-1-0"></span>have been widely employed in electrocatalytic systems, such as the oxygen evolution,[18,19](#page-8-0) oxygen reduction reaction (ORR),[20–22](#page-8-0) carbon dioxide reductio[n23–25](#page-8-0) and nitrogen reduction reaction[.26,27](#page-8-0)

ORR is the key reaction in fuel cells and metal‐air batteries[.28–32](#page-9-0) Since 2015, Liu et al. has first demonstrated metal‐free COFs as efficient electrocatalysts for ORR.[33](#page-9-0) Yan et al. has developed two metal‐free azo‐/vinyl‐decorated COFs linked by unsaturated bonds toward as efficient ORR electrocatalysts.[34](#page-9-0) Furthermore, by introducing methyl groups into the biphenyl‐based COFs, the band gap has been effectively modulated and the intermediate adsorption has been enhanced, then the ORR process has been improved.[35](#page-9-0) To enhance the catalytic activity, different heteroatoms have been developed. For example, Li and his co‐workers have reported two thiophene‐sulfur COFs and the high ORR activity was from the thiophene‐sulfur active sites.[36](#page-9-0) Moreover, various heteroatoms (Se, S or O) have been introduced into crystalline benzotrithiophene‐based COFs to enhance the ORR activity[.37](#page-9-0) In addition, we have explored various linkages to catalyze ORR, such as imine, azine, oxazole, and amide.[21](#page-8-0) In addition to metal‐free catalysts, metal‐porphyrin based building blocks were also adopted to construct catalytic sites toward ORR. Liu et al. have first integrated diarylamine derivatives into the Co‐porphyrin based frameworks, which improved the electron transport and active surface areas of frameworks during ORR process[.17](#page-8-0) Bhunia el al. has reported two Co porphyrinic frameworks and has demonstrated that the different interaction between Co‐porphyrin and two various linkages exhibited reactivity difference toward ORR.[38](#page-9-0) However, the catalytic activity was still under improved, because the metal sites were ordered stacked in the skeletons via pi‐pi interaction.

In this work, we have designed highly catalytic Pd sites immobilized via an imide‐linked COF. The abundant pyridine units and imide linkages in the COFs provided anchoring sites for Pd ions, and the open one dimensional pore channels works as the mass transport way in the catalytic process. The designed catalyst was able to catalyze ORR with half‐wave potential of 0.83 V, which was superior to other reported COFs.

## **2** <sup>|</sup> **RESULTS AND DISCUSSION**

The designed strategy was shown in Figure 1A. The template PTTA‐PMA‐COF was synthesized from 4,4',4"‐ (pyridine‐2,4,6‐triyl)trianiline (PTTA) and pyromellitic acid (PMA) with benzoic acid as catalyst, at 200°C for 5 days, with a yield of 93.1%. Then, Na2PdCl4 solution

<span id="page-2-0"></span>was added to Ethylene glycol (EG) containing PTTA‐ PMA‐COF to obtain COF‐Pd2þ. Finally, sodium citrate dihydrate was used to reduce the Na2PdCl4 to form COF‐Pd.

The Fourier transform infrared (FT IR) spectroscopy and solid 13C cross‐polarization/magic‐angle spinning solid‐state nuclear magnetic resonance (CP/MAS ssNMR) were first investigated to confirm the structural information of PTTA‐PMA‐COF. The FT IR spectra exhibited the peaks at 1775 and 1724 cm−<sup>1</sup> , attributed to the five‐ membered imide carbonyl groups of PTTA‐PMA‐COF (Figure 2A, black curve). The C=N bond in the pyridine ring was at 1632 cm−<sup>1</sup> . Additionally, the signal at 1429 cm−<sup>1</sup> can be assigned to C‐N linkage. As shown in Figure [1B](#page-1-0), the peaks at 163 ppm were from the carbonyl carbon of the imide ring, which revealed that imide‐ linked COF was constructed successfully. The signals from 114 to 156 ppm were assigned to the carbon atoms in PTTA. Furthermore, the peaks at 136 and 114 ppm were attributed to carbon atoms of benzene units in PMA. These experimental results clearly demonstrated the successful construction of imide‐linked COF.

The crystallinity of PTTA‐PMA‐COF was examined by the powder X‐ray diffraction (PXRD) technique. The PXRD patterns of PTTA‐PMA‐COF showed peaks at 2.8°, 4.9°, 5.7°, 7.4°, 10.2°, 12.4°, and 24.1°, which were assigned to (100), (110), (200), (210), (220), (230) and (001) facets, respectively (Figure [1C\)](#page-1-0). Pawley refinements were conducted to study the theoretical structures with the self‐consistent charge density functional tight binding (DFTB) approach. The experimental results generally match the simulated results with low factors of *R*wp = 3.42% and *R*<sup>p</sup> = 2.62%. The simulated molecular structures of PTTA‐PMA‐COF with AA and AB stacking were conducted (Figure [1D](#page-1-0) and Figure S1) and the simulated PXRD patterns of AA stacking model were strongly in accord with the experimental results (Tables S1 and S2). The cell parameters of PTTA‐PMA‐ COF for AA stacking are *a* = 36.55 Å, *b* = 36.54 Å, *c* = 3.48 Å, *α* = *β* = 90°, and *γ* = 120°.

To reveal the chemical structures of COF‐Pd2<sup>þ</sup> and COF‐Pd, the FT IR spectrum and PXRD patterns were then used. From the FT IR spectra, the C=O bonds of imide carbonyl groups in COF‐Pd2<sup>þ</sup> and COF‐Pd were observed at 1775 and 1724 cm−<sup>1</sup> (Figure 2A, blue and red curves). The C=N and C‐N linkages of COF‐Pd2<sup>þ</sup> and COF‐Pd were at 1632 and 1429 cm−<sup>1</sup> . As shown in Figure 2B, the crystal structure of COF‐Pd2<sup>þ</sup> well remained after anchoring Pd2<sup>þ</sup> into the frameworks, with peaks of (100), (110), (200), (210), (220), (230), and (001)

at 2.7°, 5.0°, 5.7°, 7.6°, 10.1°, 12.4°, and 24.3°, respectively. The COF‐Pd also displayed a good crystallinity with intense peaks at 2.7° (100), 5.0° (110), 5.7° (200), 7.5° (210), 10.0° (220), 12.4° (230), and 24.1° (001). Furthermore, the PXRD patterns of COF‐Pd exhibited that the new peaks appeared at 40.0° and 46.6° were assigned to the (111) and (200) planes of Pd crystal. The above results indicated that the chemical structures and crystallinities of COF‐Pd2<sup>þ</sup> and COF‐Pd were retained well.

The N2 sorption isotherm measurements of as‐ synthesized materials were performed at 77 K. PTTA‐ PMA‐COF displayed a similar IV‐type isotherm with a clearly hysteresis loops, suggesting the presence of microporous and mesoporous structure (Figure [2C,](#page-2-0) black curve). Accordingly, PTTA‐PMA‐COF had a Brunauer‐ Emmett‐Teller (BET) surface area of 1114.75 m<sup>2</sup> g−<sup>1</sup> , with a pore volume of 0.56 cm3 g−<sup>1</sup> . The pore size distribution of PTTA‐PMA‐COF was calculated from the nonlinear density functional theory (NLDFT). And the result showed that the pore size of PTTA‐PMA‐COF mainly centered at 3.02 nm, which was in good agreement with the predicted structure as mentioned above (Figure S2). In comparison to the original PTTA‐PMA‐ COF, COF‐Pd2<sup>þ</sup> and COF‐Pd demonstrated decreased BET surface area (779.10 and 120.51 m<sup>2</sup> g−<sup>1</sup> ) and smaller pore volume (0.44 and 0.10 cm<sup>3</sup> g−<sup>1</sup> ). Moreover, the corresponding pore size of COF‐Pd2<sup>þ</sup> and COF‐Pd were both about 3.02 nm.

The thermal stability of COF, COF‐Pd2<sup>þ</sup> and COF‐Pd were explored by the thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) measurement. The TGA curves supported that COF, COF‐Pd2<sup>þ</sup> and COF‐Pd were thermostable before 400°C under N2 atmosphere (Figure S3).

To study the structural information and surface electronic properties of electrocatalysts, the X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out. The XPS spectra of PTTA‐PMA‐COF showed peaks corresponding to C, N, O elements (Figure S4A). The typical features of C, N, O and Pd in COF‐Pd2<sup>þ</sup> and COF‐Pd were displayed in the XPS spectra (Figure S4B and S4C). In the high‐resolution of C 1s spectra of PTTA‐ PMA‐COF and COF‐Pd2þ, the peaks located at 283.91, 284.80, and 288.08 eV were assigned to C‐N, C‐C, and C=O bonds (Figure [2D](#page-2-0)). However, the binding energies of C‐N, C‐C, and C=O bonds for COF‐Pd were 284.13, 284.80, and 288.08 eV. The increase of binding energy of C‐N bonds indicated that the Pd nanoparticles (NPs) tuned the electronic environment of the frameworks. As shown in Figure [2E](#page-2-0), the high‐resolution of N 1s spectra of PTTA‐PMA‐COF exhibited the peaks at 397.89 and 400.15 eV, corresponding C=N and C‐N bonds. For the COF‐Pd2þ, the peaks located in 397.91 and 399.95 eV were from C=N and C‐N. The binding energy of C=N and C‐N for COF‐Pd was 397.54 and 399.60 eV, which was negative shifted by 0.37 and 0.35 eV than that of COF‐ Pd2<sup>þ</sup>. This difference of binding energy revealed the reduction of Pd2<sup>þ</sup> to Pd<sup>0</sup> . The Pd 3dss spectra was further investigated to confirm the electron states of palladium. For COF‐Pd2<sup>þ</sup> and COF‐Pd, the major peaks at 337.20, 342.38, and 337.02, 342.03 eV were assigned to Pd2þ, while the other peaks at 334.83, 340.06 and 334.98, 340.23 eV were attributed to Pd0 (Figure [2F](#page-2-0)). In addition, the relative contents of Pd2<sup>þ</sup> and Pd0 were 76.39% and 23.61% for COF‐Pd2þ. For COF‐Pd, the weight content of Pd2<sup>þ</sup> decreased to 37.68% and that of Pd increased to 65.32% compared with COF‐Pd2þ, suggesting the formation of Pd NPs. The inductively coupled plasma‐optical emission spectrometry (ICP‐OES) was used to determine the Pd content in the COF‐Pd2<sup>þ</sup> and COF‐Pd catalysts. The weight content for Pd of COF‐Pd was 3.5%, which was 8.75 times of that from COF‐Pd2<sup>þ</sup> (0.4%). This suggested that the Pd reduction occurred inside the pores of PTTA‐PMA‐COF rather than in the solution.

The UV‐vis absorption spectra were conducted to determine the bandgaps. Accordingly, the bandgaps for PTTA‐PMA‐COF, COF‐Pd2þ, COF‐Pd were 1.68, 1.74 and 0.25 eV respectively (Figure S5A and S5B). Compared with PTTA‐PMA‐COF and COF‐Pd2þ, the smallest bandgap of COF‐Pd implied the highest conductivity, indicating that introducing Pd NPs into the PTTA‐PMA‐ COF frameworks could enhance the electronic transfer ability. In addition, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) positions were revealed by conducting Mott‐ Schottky measurements (Figures S5C‐5E). The HOMO positions of PTTA‐PMA‐COF, COF‐Pd2<sup>þ</sup> and COF‐Pd were –0.08, –0.01, and –1.47 eV, respectively (Figure S5F).

The morphology of PTTA‐PMA‐COF, COF‐Pd2<sup>þ</sup> and COF‐Pd were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As revealed by Figures S6‐S8, the morphologies of PTTA‐ PMA‐COF, COF‐Pd2<sup>þ</sup> and COF‐Pd exhibited aggregated spheres. Moreover, the High‐resolution TEM images of PTTA‐PMA‐COF confirmed its outstanding crystallinity and the simulated crystal structure (Figures [3A–B](#page-4-0) and Figure S9). The TEM image of COF‐Pd2<sup>þ</sup> showed that no obvious NPs were found in the PTTA‐PMA‐COF frameworks (Figure [3C](#page-4-0) and Figure S10). The TEM image of COF‐Pd indicated the distribution of Pd NPs in PTTA‐ PMA‐COF frameworks and that the average size of Pd NPs was 7.4 nm (Figure [3D](#page-4-0) and Figure S11). HR‐TEM images of COF‐Pd revealed clear lattice fringes with a distance of 0.22 nm, which were indexed as the typical (111) plane of Pd NPs (Figure [3E\)](#page-4-0). The corresponding energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) characterizations confirmed the homogeneous distribution of C, N, O and

Pd elements on the COF‐Pd catalyst (Figure 3F and Figure S12).

The local atomic and electronic structures of COF‐Pd were further determined by the X‐ray absorption near‐ edge structure (XANES) and extended X‐ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) measurements. The XANES spectra of COF‐Pd revealed that the near‐edge absorption energy of the Pd K‐edge was different from that of Pd foil (Figure [4A,](#page-5-0) black curve) and close to that from PdO (Figure [4A](#page-5-0), blue curve). The *k*<sup>2</sup> ‐weighted FT of EXAFS at the Pd K‐edge were conducted to investigate the coordination environments. The FT‐EXAFS fitting of COF‐Pd at Pd‐edges only exhibited a dominant peak at 2.52 Å (without phase shift), which was assigned to the Pd‐Pd scattering paths (Figure [4B](#page-5-0)). The least‐squares EXAFS fitting of COF‐Pd in *R* space was further conducted to obtain the quantitative structural parameters. The EXAFS results indicated that the coordination numbers of Pd‐O and Pd‐Pd were evaluated to be 3.3 and 10.9, respectively (Figure [4C](#page-5-0) and Table S3). The bond distances of Pd‐O and Pd‐Pd were 1.96 and 2.77 Å. Moreover, the wavelet transforms contour plots of Pd in COF‐Pd demonstrated an intensity maximum of about 10.2 Å−<sup>1</sup> , corresponding to the Pd‐O and Pd‐Pd coordination (Figure [4D](#page-5-0)).

The electrochemical ORR activities of the catalysts were investigated in an alkaline solution (0.1 M KOH). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) technique was first measured in an O2 or N2‐saturated solution at scan rates of 10 mV s −1 . Significant peaks at 0.79 V, 0.86 V, and 1.00 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) of PTTA‐PMA‐COF, COF‐Pd2<sup>þ</sup> and COF‐Pd were observed in the O2 condition, but no peaks appeared under N2 atmosphere (Figure S13), which showed their ORR activity. In order to reveal the basic ORR activities of as‐prepared catalysts, the rotating disk electrode (RDE) technique was conducted at an electrode rotation of 1600 rpm. The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves showed that the onset potential (EO) and the half‐wave potential (E1/2) of COF‐ Pd were 0.97 and 0.83 V, respectively (Figure [5A](#page-6-0)). By contrast, PTTA‐PMA‐COF and COF‐Pd2<sup>þ</sup> achieved a more negative EO (0.80 and 0.84 V) and E1/2 (0.66 and 0.72 V), indicating that the COF‐Pd catalyst showed higher ORR activity. Furthermore, the limited current

density of PTTA‐PMA‐COF, COF‐Pd2<sup>þ</sup> and COF‐Pd were 4.7, 6.0, and 6.1 mA cm−<sup>2</sup> .

To study the kinetic behavior of those catalysts, Tafel slopes were obtained from the LSV curves. As shown in Figure [5B](#page-6-0), the COF‐Pd had a smaller Tafelslope of 160 mV dec−<sup>1</sup> than those of PTTA‐PMA‐COF (182 mV dec−<sup>1</sup> ) and COF‐Pd2<sup>þ</sup> (181 mV dec−<sup>1</sup> ), suggesting its faster kinetic behavior toward ORR. The Koutecky‐Levich (K‐L) plots were calculated from LSV curves with various rotating speeds. The K‐L plots of PTTA‐PMA‐COF, COF‐Pd2<sup>þ</sup> and COF‐Pd displayed linearity at 0.3 V, 0.4 and 0.5 V and the fitting lines are nearly parallel (Figures S14‐S16). In addition, the current density for PTTA‐PMA‐COF, COF‐Pd2<sup>þ</sup> and COF‐Pd continuously increased while the rotational speed increased, suggesting that O2 diffusion is significant during the ORR process.

To identify the ORR activity origin, the conversion frequency (TOF) and mass activity (MA) of the materials were calculated (Figure [5C\)](#page-6-0). At 0.83 V versus RHE, the TOF and MA values of COF‐Pd were 0.0247 s <sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> and 3.2 A g−<sup>1</sup> , which were 2.3 and 16 times higher than that of COF‐Pd2<sup>þ</sup> (0.0106 s <sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> for TOF value, and 0.2 A g−<sup>1</sup> for MA). This revealed that the active utilization efficiency of COF‐Pd was higher than that of COF‐Pd2<sup>þ</sup>.

The rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE) measurements were explored to confirm the ORR selectivity of these catalysts. In the potential range of 0.2–0.8 V versus RHE, the electron transfer numbers (*n*) of COF‐Pd were 3.80–3.97, which were higher than those of PTTA‐PMA‐ COF (3.12–3.87) and COF‐Pd2<sup>þ</sup> (3.84–3.92) (Figure [5D\)](#page-6-0). Furthermore, the corresponding H2O2 yields of COF‐Pd were 9.9%–1.4%, which were smaller than that of PTTA‐PMA‐COF (44.0%–3.2%) and COF‐Pd2<sup>þ</sup> (8.0%– 3.8%). As a result, the ORR process of COF‐Pd was an excellent four‐electron pathway.

The electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) revealed the electrode area of as‐synthesis materials that actually participates in the ORR process (Figure S17). Additionally, ECSA was calculated by measuring the double‐layer capacitance (*Cdl*) to investigate the intrinsic activity of electrocatalysts. Asshown in Figure [5E](#page-6-0), COF‐Pd exhibited a significantly larger *Cdl* value (7.42 mF cm−<sup>2</sup> )

(D) Electron transfer number and H2O2 yield plots determined from the rotating ring disk electrode measurements of PTTA‐PMA‐COF (black curve), COF‐Pd2<sup>þ</sup> (blue curve) and COF‐Pd (red curve) in oxygen‐saturated KOH (0.1 M) aqueous solution.

than that of PTTA‐PMA‐COF (3.89 mF cm−<sup>2</sup> ) and COF‐ Pd2<sup>þ</sup> (4.33 mF cm−<sup>2</sup> ), indicating that the COF‐Pd contained more exposed catalytic sites than PTTA‐PMA‐COF and COF‐Pd2þ. The LSV curves were normalized by ECSA to further study the ECSA contribution. Impressively, COF‐Pd displayed lower EO and E1/2 values in comparison to those of PTTA‐PMA‐COF and COF‐Pd2þ, while indicating a lower limited current density (Figure 5F). This indicated that the larger ECSA of COF‐Pd should be responsible for the superior ORR activity. Besides, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were conducted to investigate the charge transfer ability. The EIS plots possessed the charge transfer resistances (Rct) of COF‐Pd (47.9 Ω) was much smaller than that of PTTA‐PMA‐COF (53.1 Ω) and COF‐Pd2<sup>þ</sup> (53.4 Ω), which revealed the faster charge transfer ability of COF‐Pd (Figure S18).

In addition, the long‐term stability of the COF‐Pd catalyst was evaluated by a chronoamperometric measurement at 0.465 V versus RHE. The relative current density remained stable generally in 12 h, validating the stability of COF‐Pd catalyst (Figure S19). Moreover, PXRD and FT IR characterizations of COF‐Pd electrocatalyst were carried out after the chronoamperometric measurement. The PXRD patterns and FT IR demonstrated that all the peaks remained after long‐term tests (Figures S20 and S21). Thus, the structure ofCOF‐Pd was wellretained. And the electrochemical poison experiments were conducted by adding MeOH into the electrolyte. Accordingly, the MeOH poisoned current density revealed a slight variation compared with the initial one, confirming the outstanding stability of COF‐Pd (Figure S22).

To identify the catalytically active sites of COF‐Pd, 0.5 M potassium thiocyanate (KSCN) was added to 0.1 M KOH solution. With addition of KSCN, the current density of COF‐Pd exhibited a significant decrease, indicating that Pd NPs were the active centers for ORR because of the poisoning effect of SCN<sup>−</sup> for metal sites (Figure S23).[39](#page-9-0)

## **3** <sup>|</sup> **CONCLUSION**

In this study, we have firstsynthesized a new imide‐linked COF, in which the pyridine units are the linkers. The synthesized COF had high crystallinity and porosities. With anchoring Pd NPs via pyridine units and imide‐ linkages, the Pd sites have shown higher activity in ORR than other reported catalytic COFs. This work guides us a new strategy to develop catalysts based on COFs.

Catalyst preparation: In a typical synthesis of PTTA-PMA-COF, PTTA (0.01 mmol, 35.1 mg), PMA (0.15 mmol, 38.1 mg) and benzoic acid (0.6 mmol, 73.28 mg) were added into a Pyrex tube. The tube was degassed and sealed under vacuum for three times. After that, the tube was placed in a 200°C oven for 5 days. The powder was collected and solvent-exchanged with MeOH and THF. The PTTA-PMA-COF was afforded by drying at 60°C under vacuum for 6 h. The yield was 93.1%.

Synthesis of COF-Pd<sup>2+</sup>: 20 mg PTTA-PMA-COF was firstly dispersed in 20 mL EG and stirred for 2 h. 100 µL Na<sub>2</sub>PdCl<sub>4</sub> solution (31.2 mg Na<sub>2</sub>PdCl<sub>4</sub> in 100 mL EG) was added to the mixture and stirred another 2 h. Then, the powder was filtered and washed with EG and THF. The COF-Pd<sup>2+</sup> was obtained by drying at 60°C under vacuum for 6 h. The yield was 90.5%.

Synthesis of COF-Pd: 20 mg PTTA-PMA-COF was firstly dispersed in 20 mL EG and stirred for 2 h. 100 µL Na<sub>2</sub>PdCl<sub>4</sub> solution (31.2 mg Na<sub>2</sub>PdCl<sub>4</sub> in 100 mL EG) was added to the mixture and stirred another 2 h. Then, 39 mg sodium citrate dihydrate was added to the above solution and heated at 120°C for 5 h to reduce the Na<sub>2</sub>PdCl<sub>4</sub>. The powder was collected by filtered and washed with EG and THF. The COF-Pd was produced by drying at 60°C under vacuum for 6 h. The yield was 85.7%.

*Electrochemical performance tests*: The catalyst (5 mg) with carbon black (3 mg) was ultrasonic dispersed in a Nafion ethanol solution (0.25 wt.%, 500 µL) for 2 h to yield a homogeneous ink. The catalyst ink (25 μL) was pipetted onto a glassy carbon electrode (d = 4.00 mm,  $S = 0.125 \text{ cm}^{-2}$ ) with a loading amount of 1.0 mg cm<sup>-2</sup>. All the electrochemical measurements were conducted in a conventional three-electrode cell using the electrochemical workstation (Pine Research Instrumentation, USA) at room temperature. The Ag/AgCl (3 M KCl) and platinum wire were used as reference and counter electrodes, respectively. A RDE with a glassy carbon disk served as the substrate for the working electrode for evaluating the ORR activity of various catalysts. The electrochemical experiments were conducted in O2saturated aqueous solution of KOH (0.1 M KOH) for ORR. A RRDE electrode with a Pt ring and a glassy carbon disk served as the substrate for the working electrode for evaluating the ORR activity and selectivity of various catalysts. On the basis of ring and disk currents, the electron-transfer number (n) and four-electron selectivity of catalysts based on the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> yield [H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (%)] were calculated from the equations:

$$n = 4I_D/[(I_R/N) + I_D]$$
  $H_2O_2~(\%) = 200(I_R/N)/[(I_R/N) + I_D]$ 

In which  $I_R$  and  $I_D$  are the disk and ring currents, respectively, and the ring collection efficiency N is 0.37. All the potentials (E) were reported with respect to the RHE and conversed using the formula:

$$E (vs. RHE) = E (vs. Ag/AgCl) + 0.196 V + 0.059 \times pH$$

For the CV tests, the potential range was circularly scanned at 0.2–1.0 V (vs. RHE) at a scan rate of 50 mV s<sup>-1</sup> after purging O<sub>2</sub> gas for 30 min. After 20 cycles of CV, the LSV test was conducted at a rotating speed of 1600 rpm and a scan rate of 5 mV s<sup>-1</sup> in the range of 0.2-1.0 V (vs. RHE).

The Tafel slope was estimated by linear fitting of the polarization curves according to the Tafel equation:

$$E = b \times \log j + a$$

where *j* is the current density and *b* is the Tafel slope.

To estimate the double layer capacitance, the electrolyte was deaerated by bubbling with nitrogen, and then the voltammogram was evaluated again in the deaerated electrolyte. The EIS was measured from 10<sup>-1</sup> Hz-10<sup>6</sup> Hz at a potential of 0.815 V (vs. RHE). The chronoamperometric measurement at a constant potential of 0.465 V (vs. RHE) was carried out to test the stability of COF-Pd.

Mott-Schottky curves test: Preparation of working electrode: 2 mg catalyst powder was mixed with 1.0 mL ethanol and 50 µL Nafion (5%) dispersion, and ultrasonic treatment was performed for 30 min. Electrochemical test for Mott-Schottky curves: Electrochemical measurements were performed in a three-electrode cell using the Ag/ AgCl electrode as the reference electrode.

ECSA calculation: The ECSA was calculated by the method of double-layer capacitance ( $C_{dl}$ ). To be specific, CV curves of electrocatalysts are measured at different scan rates in the non-Faradaic regions (i.e., at potentials where no charge-transfer reactions occur but absorption and desorption processes can take place) under the same conditions used for the ORR tests.

$$ECSA = C_{dl} / C_S$$

where  $C_s$  is the specific capacitance of the sample or the capacitance of an atomically smooth planar surface of the material per unit area. For our estimates of surface area, we use general specific capacitances of  $C_s = 0.040 \text{ mF cm}^{-2} \text{ in}$ 0.1 M KOH based on typical reported values.

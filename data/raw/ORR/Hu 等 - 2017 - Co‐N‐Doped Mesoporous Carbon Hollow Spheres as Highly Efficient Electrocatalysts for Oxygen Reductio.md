*Feng Hu, Hongchao Yang, Changhong Wang, Yejun Zhang, Huan Lu, and Qiangbin Wang\**

*Rational design of cost-effective, nonprecious metal-based catalysts with desirable oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance is extremely important for future fuel cell commercialization, etc. Herein, a new type of ORR catalyst of Co-N-doped mesoporous carbon hollow sphere (Co-N-mC) was developed by pyrolysis from elaborately fabricated polystyrene@polydopamine-Co precursors. The obtained catalysts with active Co sites distributed in highly graphitized mesoporous N-doped carbon hollow spheres exhibited outstanding ORR activity with an onset potential of 0.940 V, a half-wave potential of 0.851 V, and a small Tafel slope of 45 mV decade*−*<sup>1</sup> in 0.1 m KOH solution, which was comparable to that of the Pt/C catalyst (20%, Alfa). More importantly, they showed superior durability with little current decline (less than 4%) in the chronoamperometric evaluation over 60 000 s. These features make the Co-N-mC one of the best nonprecious-metal catalysts to date for ORR in alkaline condition.*

## **1. Introduction**

The increasing energy crisis and rising environmental concerns are stimulating intense research on developing sustainable energy conversion and storage systems with environmental benignity, such as fuel cells and metal-air batteries.[1–3] To achieve optimal performance of these renewable-energy systems, it is critical to develop electrocatalysts with high efficiency to promote the cathodic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), which often suffers from sluggish kinetics. Pt-based materials are the well-known ORR catalysts with superior activity; however, the prohibitive cost, deficient reserve, and limited durability impede their largescale applications.[4,5] Accordingly, exploration of cost-effective eletrocatalysts with competitive performance to replace Pt-based materials has been a foremost subject of this field.

To date, a wide range of nonprecious metal catalysts have been explored for ORR, including transition-metal-coordinating macrocyclic compounds,[6–8] metal-nitrogen-doped carbon (M-N/C) catalysts pyrolyzed from transition-metal precursors,[9,10] transition-metal oxide-, carbide-, chalcogenide-, or phosphide-carbon hybrids,[11–22] and metal-free carbon materials with heteroatom doping.[23–25] Amongst these, the M-N/C materials are considered to be very promising candidates with Pt-comparable activity partially induced by metal-nitrogen coordinating active sites on the surface.[26] To synthesize such catalysts, direct pyrolysis of carbon, nitrogen, and metal salt precursors was widely adopted.[27,28] The direct-pyrolysis method, although is simple, typically does not allow much control over the location of the active sites and often results in severe aggregation, which has negative impacts on the ORR performance involving three

respects. First, the irreversible aggregation largely reduces the surface active sites and thereby restricts the activity. Second, the prepared catalysts by coarse pyrolysis may have low surface area and poor pore structure impeding the access for reactants to reach active sites. Third, the weak manipulation of the active site distribution discounts the reproducibility of the catalysts. Therefore, it is urgent to develop a new route to prepare M-N/C catalysts with high specific surface area, rich pore structure and homogeneous distribution of active sites.

Rational design of the precursors to render the M-N/C catalysts with multiple and isolated active sites easily reached by the catalysis reactants may largely ameliorate the above troubles and thereby improve the ORR performance. Herein, we developed a new type of M-N/C catalysts, in which two forms of metal including coordinating Co moieties and Co nanoparticles (CoNPs) were encapsulated in mesoporous N-doped carbon hollow spheres (Co-N-mC) by pyrolyzing the elaborately fabricated polystyrene@polydopamine-Co (PS/PDA-Co) precursor. The resulted Co-N-mC catalysts had high surface area (342.3 m2 g−<sup>1</sup> ) and large pore size (4.7 nm) allowing the easy access for reactants. More importantly, the as-prepared catalyst possessed two kind of active components including the homogeneously distributed coordinating Co moieties (CoC*x*N*y* or CoN*x*) with superior ORR catalytic activity[19] as well as isolated CoNPs confined in the graphitized N-doped carbon activating oxygen for better ORR activity.[29–31] Because of these ORR-desired features, the catalyst showed outstanding electrocatalytic performance with positive onset and half-wave potentials, low Tafel slope, and long-term durability in alkaline media. To the best of our knowledge, the present Co-N-mC catalyst was one of the most efficient transition-metal-based catalysts ever reported for ORR with competitive performance comparable to the state-of-the-art Pt/C catalyst.

# **2. Results and Discussion**

The Co-N-mC catalysts with well-controlled structures were synthesized via facile fabrication of PS/PDA-Co precursors followed by pyrolysis under inert atmosphere (**Scheme 1**). First, highly uniform PS microspheres with a diameter of ≈270 nm were prepared at a large scale by the emulsion method (Figure S1a, Supporting Information). The obtained PS microspheres dispersed in Tris solution were mixed with dopamine solution under vigorous stirring, followed by the dropwise addition of cobalt nitrate solution. Polydopamine formed in situ on the surface of PS by the

dopamine polymerization under the mildly alkaline condition while anchoring cobalt ions by its chelating group resulting in PS/PDA-Co (Figure S1b, Supporting Information) with an increased diameter of ≈328 nm. It was noted that the fixed Co ions uniformly distributed in the PDA layer, which can be clearly observed from the loop distribution in the element mapping in Figure S1c (Supporting Information). Subsequently, the PS/PDA-Co was collected and dried, and then subjected to pyrolysis under Ar atmosphere to afford the Co-N-mC electrocatalysts. For comparison, N-doping carbon (NC) shells and NC spheres were obtained by pyrolysis of PDA-coated PS and PDA spheres without cobalt ions, respectively (Figures S1d and S2, Supporting Information).

The morphology and phase structure of Co-N-mC catalysts were carefully characterized. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images in **Figure 1**a,b and the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images in Figure S3 (Supporting Information) showed the well-defined hollow spherical structure of the Co-N-mC catalysts after the decomposition of PS under the thermal treatment. Isolated CoNPs were encased by the PDA-derived carbon shells. Close observation revealed that the carbon shells with an average thickness of 18 nm were seem to be grafted by bubble-shaped carbons resulting from the graphitization of carbonized PDA in the presence of cobalt.[32] The high-resolution TEM image in Figure 1c clearly showed a typical CoNP enclosed by graphite-like layers which has interlayer spacing of 0.209 and 0.345 nm corresponding to the (111) plane of CoNP and (002) plane of graphitic carbon, respectively.[33] For comparison, the NC shells were obtained by pyrolysis from PDA-coated PS precursors shown in Figure 1d–f. It was interesting that without Co the pyrolyzed NC shells suffered from collapse of the PDA-derived carbon. Close observation of NC shells in Figure 1f indicated that the NC shells exhibited irregularly porous structure. The porous structure has less malleability and thereby higher strain force compared with graphite-like layers which may be responsible for this collapse. The high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) image and corresponding energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS) maps in **Figure 2** confirmed the presence of C, N, and Co in the Co-N-mC. Notably, except the CoNPs, all the C, N, and Co elements were homogeneously distributed in the Co-N-mC catalysts. We expected that the highly dispersed Co species and CoNPs encased in N-doped graphitic carbon as active sites can afford high ORR electrocatalysis performance.

The phase state of Co in the as-prepared catalysts was further confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD, **Figure 3**a) with characteristic peaks at two theta values of 44.2°, 51.5°, and 75.8°, which can be indexed to (111), (200), and (220) crystal planes of the Co phase, respectively. The broad peak at 20°–30° corresponded to highly graphitized carbon with certain defects and Co, N dopants. A slight downshift from the (002) facets of graphite carbon (26.5°) indicated a certain amount of amorphous carbon in Co-N-mC catalysts.[34] The surface composition of the catalysts is of particular importance and has been examined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). As shown in Figure S4 (Supporting Information), the full XPS spectrum revealed the presence of carbon, cobalt, nitrogen, and oxygen consistent with the result of EDS. XPS investigation of the C 1s spectrum of Co-N-mC in Figure 3b indicated that the C after carbonization of PDA mainly converted into sp<sup>2</sup> C combined with an high level of N dopants. Deconvolution of the high-resolution N 1s XPS spectrum yielded three peaks at 398.7, 401.0, and 403.1 eV (Figure 3c) corresponding to pyridinic, graphitic, and oxidic nitrogen, respectively, in which the peak for graphitic N was dominant due to the high degree of graphitization of Co-N-mC.[35–37] The satellite peak at 406.1 eV was a "shakeup" satellite from the three-coordinated nitrogen by π–π<sup>∗</sup>

transition.[38] Further Co 2p XPS survey in Figure 3d with broad Co 2p peaks presented two chemically distinct species including metallic Co (778.5 eV) and CoIII/II species peaks of Co 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 at 781.4 and 787.2 eV, respectively. The existence of trace of Co(III) and Co(II) mainly originated from important Co forms of CoO*x* or CoC*x*N*<sup>y</sup>* (780.5 eV) and Co-N*x* (782.5 eV).[19] Furthermore, on the basis of the integrated peak areas, the atomic ratio of Co, N, O, and C in Co-N-mC was determined to be 0.44:2.63:8.32:88.61. Element contents of NC shells and NC spheres were shown in Table S1 (Supporting Information). The graphitization information of three samples was studied by Raman spectrum in Figure S5 (Supporting Information). Two characteristic peaks at 1350 cm<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> (D band) and 1580 cm<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> (G band), corresponding to disordered and graphitic carbon, respectively, were observed. The small ratio of D- and G-band peak intensity suggested high degree of graphitization of these PDA-derived samples.

The Co content, surface area, and pore structure of the Co-N-mC catalysts play significant roles in the catalytic performance and were investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and N2

adsorption–desorption analysis. During the TGA experiment, the PS and PDA were gradually oxidized and decomposed with the increasing temperature resulting in large weight loss (**Figure 4**a). The final residue with 16.1 wt% of the initial weight was the oxidized Co in the form of Co3O4. Therefore, the weight percentage of Co in the as-prepared Co-N-mC catalyst was calculated to 11.8 wt%. The type IV isotherm curve shown in Figure 4b exhibited an obvious hysteresis indicating the existence of mesopores. The rapid nitrogen uptake (*P*/*P*<sup>0</sup> > 0.9) suggested the presence of much larger micropores corresponding to the hollow interior of the Co-N-mC catalysts. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area and total pore volume of Co-N-mC were 342.3 m2 g<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> and 0.40 cm3 g<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> , respectively. Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) pore size distribution curves (Inset in Figure 4b) derived from the N2 desorption branch confirmed the presence of mesopores with average pore diameter of 4.7 nm. The surface area of Co-N-mC was a bit lower than NC spheres but much higher than NC shells (Figure S6 and Table S2, Supporting Information). Compared with NC spheres, hollow structure cannot afford the Co-N-mC higher surface area but resulted in thin shell and larger pore size. It may facilitate the exposure of active sites and rapid mass transfer for ORR-related species, which were desired for ORR electrocatalysis.

Because of the desirable features including uniform distribution of multiple active sites and easy reactant access resulting from high surface area and rich pore structure, we expected the Co-N-mC catalyst had a good ORR performance superior to that of the reference samples carried out by a conventional three-electrode system. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) tests were performed on Co-N-mC, NC spheres and NC shells in both Ar- and O2-saturated 0.1 m potassium hydroxide (KOH) electrolyte. As shown in **Figure 5**a, the CV curves presented featureless slopes for cathodic current in an Ar-saturated electrolyte. In a sharp contrast, cathodic peaks observed for all samples in O2-saturated electrolyte showed that the peak potential at 0.849 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) afforded by the Co-N-mC catalyst was much higher than that of other comparative samples of 0.690 and 0.800 V for NC spheres and NC shells, respectively. The ORR activities of these catalysts were further investigated by linear sweep voltammograms (LSVs) (Figure 5b and Table S3, Supporting Information). The NC spheres carbonized by PDA sphere exhibited worst electrocatalytic activity with a low ORR onset potential of 0.841 V consistent with the

CV result, owing to the relatively less exposure of N-doping active sites for solid sphere structure. On the contrary, NC shells from the same PDA precursor due to the easy access for ORR-related reactants had better catalytic performance with onset potential of 0.904 V. Nevertheless, the catalytic activity can be largely improved when Co species were introduced into this system to form coordinating Co species and CoNP encapsulated mesoporous carbon shells. Experimental and theoretic studies have already demonstrated the high ORR activity of transition metal (Co, Fe)-N codoping moieties.[34,39] Recent reports have proposed that carbonencapsulated transition metal nanoparticles can tune the local work function of the carbon shells and optimize their adsorption energy with ORR reactants to improve the ORR performance.[30,40] Besides, the metallic nanoparticles can improve the charge transport of electrodes for significantly elevating the current intensity benefiting the ORR.[31] Therefore, because of multiple active sites, high surface area and mesoporous structure, the Co-N-mC catalysts allowed facile access and mass transfer for ORR related species and exhibited best ORR performance with onset potential of 0.940 V and a half-wave potential of 0.851 V, which were closely comparable to the commercial Pt/C (20%, Alfa). On the contrary, a decrease in half-wave potential and limiting current density was observed when etching off the Co NPs in the Co-N-mC by an acid treatment (0.5 m H2SO4 at 90 °C for 12 h, denoted as Co-N-mC-L, Figure S7a,b, Supporting Information). Note that the Co-N-mC-L catalyst with onset and half-wave potential of 0.920 and 0.826 V, respectively, exhibited ORR activity more superior than NC spheres and NC shells demonstrating the electrocatalytic activity of coordinating Co moieties exsiting in both Co-N-mC and Co-N-mC-L.[41–43] Therefore, the coordinating Co moieties and Co NPs both contributed to the superior ORR performance of Co-N-mC.

The excellent ORR activity can also be revealed by the Tafel slope of 45 mV decade−<sup>1</sup> much smaller than that of Pt/C (68 mV decade−<sup>1</sup> ) at high potential, leading to a largely boosted mass activity (Figure 5c). Further insight into the ORR kinetics and catalytic pathway can be obtained from electron transfer number (*n*) derived from the rotating disk electrode (RDE) measurements at various rotating speeds and corresponding Koutecky–Levich (K–L) plots (Figures S7c,d and S8, Supporting Information). Typically, the current density increased with increasing rotation rate owing to the shortened diffusion distance at high speeds.

The corresponding K-L plots displayed fairly good linearity and near coincidence, suggesting first-order reaction kinetics with respect to the concentration of dissolved oxygen and a similar n value for ORR at different potentials. The n value of Co-N-mC was calculated to be about 3.7 suggesting that the Co-N-mC catalyst nearly favored a 4e ORR process, comparable to ORR catalyzed by a Pt/C catalyst. In contrast, the reference samples showed much lower electron transfer numbers of 2.8, 2.2, and 2.7 for NC spheres, NC shells, and Co-N-mC-L, respectively, indicating poor electron catalysis selectivity for these catalysts. Comparison of the electrocatalytic performance of the Co-N-mC catalyst with that of other Co-based materials reported in the previous works was shown in Figure S9 (Supporting Information). The Co-N-mC catalysts exhibited high current density at 0.8 V and halfwave potential comparable to 20% Pt/C higher than other reference materials, indicating that the Co-N-mC was one of the best nonprecious electrocatalysts (Tables S4 and S5, Supporting Information). Besides the outstanding of the eletrocatalytic activity, the Co-N-mC also exhibited high durability superior to Pt/C catalyst in 0.1 M KOH evaluated by chronoamperometric examination. As shown in Figure 5d, the Co-N-mC displayed little decay (less than 4%) of current density after 60 000 s of continuous operation at 0.7 V. It was noted that a slight increase in activity was observed which was possibly due to the removal of surface contaminants or gradual activation of the catalysts during the examination. [44,45] In contrast, the Pt/C catalyst had a 14.5% decline at the same condition.

#### 3. Conclusion

In summary, we reported a new type of ORR catalyst of mesoporous carbon hollow sphere homogenously doped with Co and N, which was pyrolyzed from elaborately fabricated PS/PDA-Co precursors. The polydopamine with rich catechol groups can chelate with Co ions, playing a key role in homogeneous distribution of Co inside the carbon shells during the pyrolysis. The Co-N-mC with multiple active sites, high surface area and mesoporous structure exhibited superior ORR activity and excellent stability for ORR comparable to the commercial Pt/C catalyst in 0.10 M KOH solution. This work provides a new protocol to fabricate novel Co-N-doped carbon hybrid and opens new avenues for the application of stable Co-based composite materials in high-efficiency electrocatalysts for ORR.

#### 4. Experimental Section

*Materials*: All chemicals were used as received without further purification. Cobalt nitrate hexahydrate ( $Co(NO_3)_2 \cdot 6H_2O$ , AR, 98.5%), potassium peroxydisulfate ( $K_2S_2O_8$ , AR, 99.5%), sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS,  $C_{12}H_{25}NaO_4S$ , AR, 99%), sodium carbonate ( $Na_2CO_3$ , AR, 99.8%), and ammonia aqueous solution ( $NH_4OH$ , AR, 28%–30%) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. 3-Hydroxytyramine hydrochloride (dopamine, 99%) was bought from Acros. Styrene ( $C_8H_8$ , CP) was obtained from Aladdin Chemistry Co., Ltd. KOH solution (HPLC, 45 wt%) and

Nafion (5 wt%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Pt/C (20 wt% Pt on Vulcan XC-72R) was obtained from Alfa. AR, CP and HPLC reflect the purity of the reagents, which are the abbreviations of analytical reagent, chemically pure, and high performance liquid chromatography, respectively.

*Synthesis of Polystyrene (PS) Colloidal Latex*: The PS latex was prepared by an aqueous emulsion polymerization according to the previous report.[46] Briefly, 0.1 g of SDS and 0.2 g of sodium carbonate were dissolved in 300 mL water. The solution was then deaerated by argon purging for 30 min, and 30 mL of styrene was added followed by heating to 60 °C for 30 min. The mixture was heated to 75 °C, and 15 mL of aqueous solution containing 0.062 g potassium persulfate was injected. The reaction was kept at 75 °C for 20 h. Finally, the milk-white latex was filtered to remove coagulations and then stored in bottle for further use.

*Synthesis of Co-N-mC Catalysts*: 10 mL PS latex was mixed with 100 mL of Tris (20 × 10−<sup>3</sup> <sup>m</sup>) followed by injection of 80 mL aqueous solution containing 400 mg dopamine. After stirring for several minutes, 400 mg Co(NO3)2·6H2O dissolved in 10 mL H2O was added by dropwise. After 24 h stirring under room temperature, the product was separated by filter and then dispersed in 100 mL Tris (20 × 10−<sup>3</sup> <sup>m</sup>) again. 100 mL aqueous solution containing 400 mg dopamine was added followed by 24 h stirring for a repeated coating to form PS/PDA-Co precursors. The products were collected by filter, washed with water for three times, and dried in the vacuum at 60 °C for 24 h. For preparation of Co-N-mC, a certain amount of PS/PDA-Co was heated to 900 °C at a heating rate of 2 °C min<sup>−</sup>1 and kept at 900 °C for 2 h under flowing Ar (60 mL min−1) atmosphere, and cooled to room temperature naturally. The synthesis procedure of the reference material of NC shells was same as that for Co-N-mC except that no Co(NO3)2·6H2O was added.

*Synthesis of NC Spheres*: In a typical reaction,[35] 0.75 mL NH4OH was mixed with 40 mL ethanol and 90 mL water under mild stirring at room temperature for 30 min. Then, 10 mL aqueous solution containing 0.5 g dopamine hydrochloride was injected into the mixture followed by 30 h stirring. Finally, the products were collected by filter and washed with water for three times. NC spheres were obtained by carbonizing the PDA spheres at 900 °C for 2 h in Ar at a rate of 5 °C min<sup>−</sup>1.

*Physicochemical Characterizations*: The morphological and lattice structural information of the products were examined with field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, Quanta 400) and TEM (200 kV, Tecnai G2 F20). The phase composition of the samples were analyzed by XRD (Bruker, D8 Advance) with Cu K<sup>α</sup> radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å). The Raman spectra were collected on a Raman spectrometer (JY, HR 800) using 532 nm laser. Chemical composition was carried out by XPS (ESCALab250). TGA was performed with NETZSCH STA 449F3. Nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherm was collected on Tristar II (Micrometrics) at 77 K. Pore size distribution of the products was recorded by BJH model using the adsorption branch on the isotherm. The specific surface area was calculated using adsorption data at the pressure range of *P*/*P*<sup>0</sup> = 0.05–0.3 by BET model.

*Electrode Preparation*: All electrochemical measurements were performed under identical conditions with the same catalyst mass loading. 5.0 mg of NC spheres, NC shells, Co-N-mC, or Pt catalyst (20 wt%, Pt/C, alfa) were dissolved in a mixture (1.0 mL) of water, ethanol, and Nafion (5.0 wt%) with a volume ratio of 3.825:1:0.175 under sonication for 40 min to form a homogeneous ink with a concentration of 5 mg mL<sup>−</sup>1. The glass carbon RDE (3 mm in diameter) was polished carefully with alumina slurries, followed by sonication in ethanol and ultrapure water, and then was blown dry by N2. Then 4 µL of the catalyst ink (containing 20 µg catalyst) was casted onto the pretreated RDE surface. The modified electrodes were left to dry under ambient conditions before use. The resulting electrode served as a working electrode.

*Electrocatalytic ORR Testing*: The electrochemical properties of the as-prepared samples were investigated in a conventional three electrode electrochemical cell by using Autolab PGSTAT302N electrochemical station. The catalyst-casted RDE was used as the working electrode, while an Ag/AgCl electrode (3 m KCl) and a platinum wire electrode were used as the reference electrode and counter electrode, respectively. The potential, measured against a Ag/AgCl electrode, was converted to the potential versus the RHE according to *E*(vs RHE) = *E*(vs Ag/AgCl) + 0.207 + 0.059pH. All the measurements were carried out at room temperature.

CV tests were performed from 0.375 to 0.975 V versus RHE at 5 mV s<sup>−</sup>1 in an Ar or O2 saturated 0.1 m KOH solution. LSVs were carried out in an O2 saturated 0.1 m KOH solution with a sweep rate of 5 mV s−1. The stability was characterized by the chronoamperometric examination which was carried out at 0.7 V versus RHE for 60 000 s. Tafel slopes were derived from LSVs.

The overall electron transfer numbers per oxygen molecule involved in a typical ORR process can be calculated from the slops of K–L plots using the following equation

$$1/j_{D} = 1/j_{K} + 1/B\omega^{1/2}$$
 (1)

where *j*K is the kinetic current in amperes at a constant potential, *j*<sup>D</sup> is the measured current on RDE, ω is the electrode rotating speed in rpm, and *B* is the reciprocal of the slope, which could be determined from the slope of K–L plot using Levich equation

$$B = 0.62 \, nFAv^{-1/6} C_{02} D_{02}^{2/3} \tag{2}$$

where *n* is the number of electrons transferred per oxygen molecule, *F* is the Faraday constant, *D*O2 is the diffusion coefficient of O2 in 0.1 m KOH, *v* is the kinetic viscosity, and *C*O2 is the bulk concentration of O2. The constant 0.62 is adopted when the rotating speed is expressed in rad s<sup>−</sup>1.

It remains a major challenge to develop a facile method to prepare non-noble metal electrocatalysts with high activity and durability to drive the sluggish oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) for proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). Herein, a highly efficient bimetallic Zn/Fe@N-doped hierarchical porous carbon (Zn/Fe-N-C) catalyst derived from ZIF-8 and hemin (host-guest) was firstly reported by one-step thermal treatment. The spatial separation of Fe<sup>2+</sup> by using hemin guest in ZIF-8 framework and the hydrocarbon-branched chains form rich Fe-N<sub>x</sub> active sites, and the evaporation of Zn<sup>2+</sup> generates highly porous structure in the Zn/Fe-N-C catalysts. Benefitting from this unique structure and composition, the resultant Zn/Fe<sub>2</sub>-N-C catalyst exhibits excellent ORR activity in both 0.1 M KOH media (onset potential,  $E_{onset}$  = 1.08 V and half-wave potential,  $E_{1/2}$  = 0.86 V vs RHE) and 0.5 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> media ( $E_{onset}$  = 1.04 V and  $E_{1/2}$  = 0.81 V), which is even comparable to the commercial Pt/C catalyst and ranks among the top of reported electrocatalysts. In addition, it also has outstanding long-term durability as well as good methanol resistance, much better than Pt/C in both acidic and alkaline media, which makes it one of the best non-noble alternatives of Pt-based catalysts for ORR electrocatalysis. This work highlights the potential to rational design and fabricate high-performance ORR catalysts for the fuel cell applications.

Facing the increasingly serious energy and environmental pollution crisis, it is urgent to seek a reusable environmental-friendly and energy-efficient new energy technology, which also stimulates the development of fuel cells.<sup>1-4</sup> Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) represent a promising sustainable energy conversion technology that requires highly efficient electrocatalysts for the sluggish kinetics of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).5, 6 Although (Pt)-based materials are the state-of-the-art electrocatalysts due to excellent catalytic activities, their large-scale application in fuel cells is still precluded by the resource scarcity, high cost, poor long-term stability and weak alcohol tolerance.<sup>7, 8</sup> Thus, great efforts have been made to obtain high-performance Pt-free electrocatalysts such as transition metal oxides, metal oxynitride compounds, metal carbonitride compounds and metal-nitrogencarbon (M-N-C).9-11 The M-N-C is considered as one of the most potential non-noble fuel cell catalysts to replace Pt-based, due to the remarkable ORR catalytic activity, low cost, excellent durability, methanol resistance and environmental friendliness. 12-14 Especially, Fe-N-C catalysts have gained a great attention due to their excellent ORR activity in alkaline media. 15, 16

Zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) are a new subfamily of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), which are constructed from tetrahedral transition metals (such as Zn or Co) bridged by an imidazolate ligand, and are typically characterized by atomically dispersed metal sites.<sup>25</sup> Owing to the unique structure, high surface area, rich carbon/nitrogen contents, and high thermal stability as well as the nature of volatile metal zinc at high temperature, ZIFs have been widely used as ideal precursors for the preparation of

To date, these Fe-N-C electrocatalysts were typically synthesized by nitrogen-carbon precursors, and high-surface area carbon black supports at high temperatures. 17, 18 However, simply utilizing pyrolysis methods to obtain these materials with uniform doping and high density active sites still remain a challenge. With years of studies, breakthroughs have been made in the selection and optimization of synthesis conditions of transition metal precursor, nitrogen source and carbon carrier for Fe-N-C catalyst material, but there is still room to regulate efficient electrocatalytic activity. 19-22 In many cases, the Fe-N-C catalyst showed better ORR performance and stability under alkaline conditions than commercial Pt, however poor activity and stability under acidic conditions. This may be caused by the dissolution of the metal leads to the destruction of the active sites structure or the corrosion of the carbon carrier makes the catalytic active sites separate from the substrate, leading to the rapid decline of catalytic performance under acidic conditions. Harsh conditions in the cathode of acidic PEMFCs require the definite Fe-N<sub>x</sub> configuration strongly stabilized by carbon black supports, which cannot be achieved by a simple chemical reaction route.<sup>23</sup> Previous studies suggest that high surface area with hierarchical porous, uniform doping, high density active sites, and high conductivity are crucial factors to achieve excellent ORR performances.<sup>24</sup>

electrocatalysts.<sup>26, 27</sup> However, nitrogen-doped carbon by direct calcination of ZIF-8 is reported to possess inferior ORR catalytic activities, by adding a secondary nitrogen or metal source and modulating the morphology have been considered as effective approaches to improve ORR performance. 23, 26, 28-32 For example, Mndoped ZIF-8 precursors were carbonized, acid etched, absorbed Mn and N sources and further thermal activation to finally prepare a high performance atomically dispersed Mn-N-C structure by Li and coworkers.<sup>28</sup> Wang et al.<sup>29</sup> reported single-atom dispersed Fe-N-C catalyst was prepared by adding iron source in the process of selfassembly of ZIF-8 by adopting calcination- acid etching- calcination processes. The obtained optimal catalysts showed better ORR activity compared with the commercial Pt/C catalyst under alkaline conditions. Jiao<sup>30</sup>, Lai<sup>23</sup> and Jiang<sup>31</sup>, proposed different iron sources were doped into the precursor of ZIF-8, via a calcination- acid etching- calcination approach, Fe-N-C catalyst with excellent performance was synthesized. Qian et al<sup>26</sup>. and Xuan et.al<sup>32</sup>, a simple approach is reported to prepare N-C ORR catalyst with high performance by pyrolyzing composites containing NaCl and ZIF-8. Based on the above considerations, the advantage of using ZIF-8 was highlighted in that work, but the synthesis procedure is still complicated involved tedious acid etching and second heating treatments. These approaches often lead to a heterogeneous morphology with poor control over the local environments for active sites. Thus, developing a feasible high-temperature pyrolysis strategy to rational design and prepare ORR catalyst with excellent performance and high stability still remains a major challenge. It is common knowledge that hemin as a natural porphyrinatoiron complex with an Fe-N<sub>4</sub> structure was potential to be used in a nonnoble metal catalyst preparation for ORR.33 However, previously reported hemin-based catalysts usually suffered from inferior activity for the ORR, especially their instability and inactivity under unfavorable pH values. Hence, it is essential to develop a facile route to fabricate Fe-N-C catalysts by hemin and ZIF-8, with catalytic performance comparable to Pt-based catalysts.

Here, we present a rationally designed and fabricated bimetallic Zn/Fe@N-doped hierarchical porous carbon (Zn/Fe-N-C) catalyst with excellent ORR catalytic activity and stability by one-step pyrolysis based on hemin and ZIF-8 precursors. During the thermal treatments, the unique hydrocarbon-branched chain and its spatial separation by Zn2+ in ZIF precursors effectively prevents the agglomeration of Fe2+ within hemin and directly converted into Nand Fe-doped highly disordered carbon, which maintaining their original polyhedral particle shape. Meanwhile, the evaporation endows porous of Zn<sup>2+</sup> increased the porosity and surface area. Because of the above process, as-prepared Zn/Fe-N-C catalyst possesses high surface area, hierarchical porous (containable and accessible active sites and mass transfer), uniform doping highdensity Fe-Nx active sites, high stability and high conductivity. As expected, compared to the derivatives of ZIF-8, as-prepared Zn/Fe-N-C catalyst exhibited excellent electrocatalytic performance without etching or activating process and outstanding long-term durability as well as good methanol resistance in both acidic and alkaline media.

Hemin  $(C_{34}H_{32}CIN_4O_4Fe, > 95\%)$  was obtained from Macklin Biochemical Technology Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China). Methanol (CH<sub>3</sub>OH, AR), ethanol (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OH, AR) and potassium hydroxide (KOH, AR) were provided by Guangdong Guanghua Sci-Tech Co., Ltd (Guangdong, China). Sulphuric acid (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, AR) was gained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd (Beijing, China). 20 % Pt/C and Nafion solution (5 %) were bought from Johnson Matthey Company and DuPont, respectively. All the chemicals were used as received without further purification.

#### 2.2 Catalyst synthesis

During the synthesis, a wide range of Fe-doped ZIF was controlled by tuning the concentration of guest molecule hemin into the ZIF-8 framework during the self-assembly of Zn2+ and 2methylimidazole (2-MEIM). Typically, 100 mg of hemin were dissolved in 20 mL DMF with stirring to form solutions A. 0.595 g of Zn(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>·6H<sub>2</sub>O and 0.657 g of 2-MEIM were dissolved in 50 mL of methanol to form solutions B and C, respectively. Subsequently, three solutions were thorough mixed, after the reaction mixture is further stirred for 24 h under room temperature, and then was kept at room temperature and aged for 24 h. The product was collected via centrifugation (10000 rpm, 10 min) and washed with ethanol several times and finally dried in vacuum at 70 °C for overnight. The synthesis of ZIF-8 was the same except that no hemin was used. Their compositions were varied systematically and labeled as ZIF-8, Fe<sub>1</sub>-ZIF-8, Fe<sub>2</sub>-ZIF-8 and Fe<sub>3</sub>-ZIF-8 representing the mass of the hemin guest as 0, 50 mg, 100 mg and 150 mg, respectively.

To this end, Fe<sub>x</sub>-ZIF-8 crystal precursors were subjected to a thermal activation at 180 °C for 1h and at a wide temperature range from 700 to 1000 °C for 2 h with a heating rate of 2 °C/min under flowing N<sub>2</sub> gas in a tube furnace to obtain the final catalyst. No additional acidic leaching and the second heating treatment were required.

#### 2.3 Material characterization.

The crystalline structures of as-synthesized samples were determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a XRD-6100 (Japan) equipped with Cu K $\alpha$  ( $\lambda$ =0.154 nm) as the radiation source. Field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM; MAIA3 LMH) and field-emission transmission electron microscope (FETEM; JEM-F200) are used to examine the morphology and structure of the samples. The high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) images were performed on a JEOL JEM-F200 (HR) field emission transmission electron microscope. Elemental mapping images were recorded using EDS spectroscope attached to TEM (JEOL, JEM-F200). Nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms were measured on BELSORP-Max apparatus at 77 K, the BET surface area was calculated to Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET)

method and the pore size distribution data was determined using the BJH method. Before, measurements were performed, the samples were degassed under vacuum at 300 °C for 24 h. Raman spectra were recorded using a Laser Raman Spectrometer using a laser wavelength of 532 nm. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed on a AXIS ULtrabld spectrometer using the C 1s peak (284.9 eV) as the reference for calibration, and shifting all other peaks in the spectrum accordingly.

#### 2.4 Electrochemical measurements

The electrochemical measurements of samples were performed using a three-electrode cell on an electrochemical workstation (CHI 760E) equipped with a rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) with 0.2462 cm<sup>2</sup> area of glass carbon disk encircled by Pt ring. RRDE modified by catalyst film was employed for the working electrode; and an Hg/HgO/KOH (1.0 M) electrode for alkaline electrolyte or Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl) electrode for acidic electrolyte, and a graphite rod acted as the reference electrode and the counter electrode, respectively. To prepare catalyst ink, 2 mg catalyst was dispersed in 0.5 mL solution containing 0.395 mL of ethanol, 0.1 mL of deionized water and 5 µL of 5 wt.% Nafion and ultrasonicated for at least 30 min to form a homogeneous catalyst ink. The 21 µL of catalyst ink was dropped on the RRDE and dried at air to form a catalyst film with loading of 0.341 mg cm<sup>-2</sup>. Commercial 20 wt% platinum on Vulcan carbon black (Pt/C) was measured for comparison.

Before the measurement, an  $O_2$  /  $N_2$  flow was used through the electrolyte in the cell for 30 min to saturate it. The catalyst-coated disk working electrode was subjected to cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves in  $O_2$  or  $N_2$ -saturated 0.1 M KOH or 0.5 M  $H_2SO_4$  at a scan rate of 50 mV/s, and the curves were scanned from 0 to 1.2 V (vs. RHE). Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) test were measured in  $O_2$ -saturated 0.1 M KOH or 0.5 M  $H_2SO_4$  at 1600 rpm with a sweep rate of 5 mV/s.

Based on RRDE measurement, the mass kinetic current density  $(j_k)$ , the yield of  $H_2O_2$  ( $H_2O_2$ %) and the number of electron-transfer (n) were calculated according to the following equations (1), (2) and (3), respectively:

$$j_k = (j \times j_L) / (j_L - j)$$
 (1)

$$H_2O_2 \% = 200i_x / (i_x \times N + i_x)$$
 (2)

$$n = 4i_{J} / \left(i_{J} + i_{L} / N\right) \tag{3}$$

where "j" is the measured current density, " $j_L$ " is diffusion-limited current density, " $i_r$ " is the ring current, " $i_d$ " is the disk current and "N" is 0.37 that is the collection efficiency of the Pt ring.

For the methanol crossover test, the chronoamperometric response at 0.8 V was measured using RRDE tests in  $O_2$ -saturated 0.1 M KOH and 0.5 M  $H_2SO_4$  at the rotating rate of 1600 rpm, followed by the injection of 1 mL 3 M methanol into 25 mL into 0.1 M KOH or 0.5 M  $H_2SO_4$ , respectively. For the electrochemical stability test, the chronoamperometric response at 0.8 V was measured using RRDE tests in  $O_2$ -saturated 0.1 M KOH and 0.5 M  $H_2SO_4$  at the rotating rate of 1600 rpm for 30000 or 40000 s, respectively. All potentials quoted in this work are converted to potentials relative to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE).

### 3 Results and discussion

#### 3.1 Preparation and morphological characterization

Fe-doped ZIF-8 were synthesized via a facile room-temperature coprecipitation route, through the self-assembly of  $Zn(NO_3)_2$  and hemin with 2-MEIM in methanol, as illustrated in Scheme 1. First, hemin guest were encapsulated in the host of ZIF-8 in situ via the assembly of  $Zn^{2+}$  and 2-MEIM, meanwhile, the  $Fe^{2+}$  in hemin competes with the  $Zn^{2+}$  to coordinate 2-MEIM in the process of

self-assembly<sup>17</sup>. The obtained sample was hereafter denoted as Fedoped ZIF-8. The crystal structures of Fe-doped ZIF-8 and carbonized materials were examined by XRD patterns (Fig. S1, Supporting Information). As shown in Fig. S1(a), all the Fe-doped ZIF-8 samples show analogous diffraction peaks, corresponding to the signals from ZIF-8, suggesting that the introduction of a low concentration of hemin does not alter the crystal structure of pristine ZIF-8 but reduces its crystallinity. Second, during the high-temperature thermal treatment process (900 °C, 2 h), the ZIF-8 host exhibits a significant confinement effect for the hemin, which were more effectively transformed into highly ORR active sites, by hemin heat treatment to enhance the density of Fe-N<sub>x</sub> sites. Meanwhile, Zn in ZIFs is easily evaporated resulting in porous carbon structures. The chemically Fe-doped ZIF approach would be an effective method to generate atomically dispersed Fe-N<sub>x</sub> active sites. Fig. S1(b). shows the XRD patterns of the carbonized pure ZIF-8 and Fe-doped ZIF-8 samples, in which all materials exhibited two peaks at 25° and 44° were assigned to the characteristic the (002) and (101) peaks of carbon, respectively. There is no metal aggregates such as metallic Fe or Fe<sub>3</sub>C phases detected in the catalysts. Fig. S1(c) only shows the Raman spectra of the major studied samples. The spectra of both samples can be fitted into four Lorentzian peaks, centering at Raman

shifts of  $\approx 1220$ ,  $\approx 1350$ ,  $\approx 1500$ , and  $\approx 1600$  cm<sup>-1</sup>.<sup>34</sup> The D band peaks located at 1350 cm<sup>-1</sup> and can be assigned to structural defects or imperfections in the graphite layers. The G band appears at 1600 cm<sup>-1</sup> and corresponds to planar motion of  $sp^2$ -carbon atoms in graphite carbon. An  $I_G/I_D$  ratio characterizes the electronic conductivity of carbon materials, and the values of Zn-N-C and Zn/Fe<sub>2</sub>-N-C are 0.24 and 0.34, respectively, indicating the introduction of hemin could improve graphitization degree. Additionally, two peaks occur around 1220 and 1500 cm<sup>-1</sup>, corresponding to the carbon out of planar graphite network and heteroatoms in graphene structures, respectively. After Fe-doping by hemin, such a proportion value of these groups increased from 32.84 % to 45.36 % (Table. S1, Supporting Information), which indicates that Fe-N dopants integrates heteroatoms within the planes of graphite carbon.

The morphological and structural variations of the obtained samples arising from the introduction of different amount of hemin have been clearly disclosed by SEM analyses.

of these samples is better than Zn-N-C, effectively preventing collapse of the ZIF-8, because the effective substitution of Fe<sup>2+</sup> to Zn<sup>2+</sup> in the assembly process can avoid the collapse of the MOF structure caused by high temperature volatilization of Zn<sup>2+</sup> in the pyrolysis process. The particle size of Zn/Fe-N-C is decided by the relative rates between seed nucleation and growth. During the process of ZIF crystal formation, with the increase of Fe content, the seed nucleation rate slowed down and the particle size of nucleation increased due to the enhanced competitiveness of Fe<sup>2+</sup> with Zn<sup>2+</sup> to coordination 2-MEIM.<sup>16</sup> Zn/Fe<sub>2</sub>-N-C exhibits the best crystal morphology, however, both of Zn/Fe<sub>1</sub>-N-C and Zn/Fe<sub>3</sub>-N-C can be observe a little crystal defect. This indicates that it is most beneficial to self-assembly of hemin and Zn(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> with 2-MEIM in this conditions.

TEM and HAADF-STEM analysis further reveals the morphological information of Zn/Fe<sub>2</sub>-N-C and Zn-N-C catalysts in Fig. 2. With various magnifications reveal that they have a well-defined rhombic dodecahedron shape, the enlargement in particle size resulted by adding of hemin is also observed, and the average particle size is about 60 and 150 nm for Zn-N-C and Zn/Fe<sub>2</sub>-N-C, respectively (Fig. 2(a-d)). Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) mapping of Zn/Fe<sub>2</sub>-N-C catalyst shows uniform distribution of C, O, N, Zn and Fe elements (Fig. 1(i), Fig. 2(f-g)), consistent with the formation of Fe-N<sub>x</sub> moieties by one-step pyrolysis of Fe<sub>2</sub>-ZIF-8.

#### 3.2 Physical properties and composition analysis

Fig. 3(a-b) shows the N<sub>2</sub> adsorption and pore size distribution of the studied samples were also measured. Zn/Fe2-N-C catalyst exhibits typical type-IV isotherms, indicating their mesoporedominant structure coexisting with some micro- and macropores. The mesopores size for the as-prepared catalysts centered at ~ 10 nm, while the macropores size centered at 30 ~ 50 nm. However, Zn-N-C catalyst similar isotherms to Zn/Fe<sub>2</sub>-N-C catalyst, but with less amount of N<sub>2</sub> adsorbed/desorbed quantities, and micropores and mesopores are predominant. The  $N_2$  adsorption-desorption isotherms characterization results of the samples are summarized in Table, S2 of the Supporting Information. The specific surface area of Zn/Fe<sub>2</sub>-N-C (772.65 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>) is almost the similar with Zn-N-C catalyst (770.94 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>). However, the total pore volume of Zn-N-C catalyst (1.2131 cm<sup>3</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>) is much larger than that of Zn/Fe<sub>2</sub>-N-C (0.8538 cm<sup>3</sup> g-1), maybe due to the addition of hemin, resulting in fewer defects in the ZIF-derived structure. Zn/Fe<sub>2</sub>-N-C and Zn-N-C catalyst showed similar microporous and mesoporous structures (Fig. 3(b), Fig. S1(d), Supporting Information). Most important of all, the significantly enhanced macropore volume indicates the successful introduction of mass transfer channels by the Fe-doped ZIF-8 (Fig. 3(b), Table S2, Supporting Information). Abundant micropores, mesoporous can increase the exposure of active sites, but macropores also provide enough space for the transfer of electrolyte and O2 with low resistance. As a result, the micro-/meso-/macro-porous (facilitating active sites access and mass transfer), rhombic dodecahedron shape

To further obtain insight into the chemical composition in  $Zn/Fe_2$ -N-C catalyst, a powerful appliance of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were employed. The survey spectrum of  $Zn/Fe_2$ -N-C displayed distinctive peaks of Fe, Zn, N, O, and C, suggesting the existence of Fe and Zn in the  $Zn/Fe_2$ -N-C catalyst (Fig. S2(a), Supporting Information), in consistent with the elemental mapping results (Fig. 2(f)). The atomic ratio of Zn, Fe and N detected are 2.06, 0.25 and 7.16 at%, respectively (Table 3S, Supporting Information), corresponding to EDS elemental atoms ratio (Fig. 2(g)). However, Zn-N-C shows a relatively higher N and Zn atomic ratio of 13.36 at% and 3.7 at%, respectively, than  $Zn/Fe_2$ -N-C, demonstrating the dominant role of the Fe-N<sub>x</sub> active sites over N<sub>x</sub>-C species in our  $Zn/Fe_2$ -N-C catalyst.

The high-resolution C 1s spectra of Zn/Fe<sub>2</sub>-N-C, where five fitted peaks located at 283.8, 284.9, 285.5, 286.6, 288.5 eV are ascribed to C-Fe,  $sp^2$ -C,  $sp^3$ -C, C-N<sub>x</sub>, and C-O/C=O, respectively, and exhibits a higher degree of graphitization and C-Fe content than Zn-N-C (Fig. S2(b), Table 4S, Supporting Information). Fig. 3(c) shows the N 1s spectra of Zn-N-C can be fitted into four peaks, centered at 398.6, 400.3, 401.3, and 403.0 eV, which correspond to pyridinic-N, pyrrolic-N, graphitic-N, and oxidized-N, respectively<sup>36</sup>; while the N 1s spectra of Zn/Fe2-N-C displays an additional fitted peak, located at 399.3 eV,corresponding to Zn/Fe-N. Fig. 3(d) shows the high-resolution Zn 2p spectrum, with  $2p_{1/2}$  and  $2p_{3/2}$  peak centered at 1021.5 and 1044.5 eV, respectively. Clearly, Zn2+ in Zn/Fe2-N-C and Zn-N-C is not completely volatilized, but part of it has been converted to a Zn-N structure and still retained in the catalyst, which played a crucial role in the stability of the catalyst<sup>37</sup>. As shown in Fig. 3(e), the highresolution Fe 2p spectrum can be fitted into two peaks, including the Fe<sup>3+</sup>  $2p_{1/2}$  peak at 724.6 eV and Fe<sup>2+</sup>  $2p_{3/2}$  peak at 711.2 eV to confirm

Moreover, combined with TEM and SEM results (Fig. 1, Fig. 2), it was further confirmed that the obtained Zn/Fe $_2$ -N-C catalyst was composed of bimetals. Considering the much higher Zn and Fe dispersion, the higher amount of pyridinic N and Fe-N is also a strong indication of more Fe-N and Zn-N bonding in the Zn/Fe $_2$ -N-C catalyst.

#### 3.3 Electrocatalytic activity and stability

The electrocatalytic activity of the obtained samples arising from the introduction of different amount of hemin and compared with the commercial Pt/C (20 wt%) catalyst are investigated by rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE) measurements in 0.1 M KOH. The CV curves of Zn/Fe<sub>x</sub>-N-C catalysts display a high double-layer capacity current with a nearly rectangular shape in a N<sub>2</sub>-saturated solution

but a sharp cathodic peak in an O2-saturated solution, suggesting their potential high activities (Fig. S3, Supporting Information). Among them, Zn/Fe<sub>2</sub>-N-C, possessing atomically dispersed rich Fe-N<sub>x</sub> active sites, and high degree of graphitization as well as abundant hierarchical porous, shows the highest reduction peak at 0.846 V, suggesting its superior ORR activity. To further evaluate the ORR performances of various catalysts, the RRDE measurements was employed. All the alkaline LSV curves are shown in Fig. 4(a) and the ORR activity parameters are summarized in Table 1. All tested catalysts are comparable with those of 20 wt% Pt/C (E<sub>onset</sub> = 1.15 V,  $E_{1/2} = 0.85$  V and diffusion-limiting current density,  $j_L = 5.46$  mA cm<sup>-</sup> <sup>2</sup>).In Fig. 4(a-b), Zn-N-C affords poor ORR catalytic activity with E<sub>1/2</sub> only of 0.65 V, which was caused by the lack of Fe and macroporous dominant structure. Obviously, the catalytic property can be greatly enhanced by introducing suitable amount of hemin in the precursor. Zn/Fe<sub>1</sub>-N-C affords much improved ORR catalytic activity with E<sub>1/2</sub> of 0.81 V and  $j_L$  of 5.13 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. Zn/Fe<sub>2</sub>-N-C has the surprisingly ORR catalytic activity of among all samples with a high E<sub>onset</sub> of 1.08 V, E<sub>1/2</sub> of 0.86 V and  $j_L = 5.67$  mA cm<sup>-2</sup> (Fig. 4(a-b), Table 1), and outperformed most previously reported noble-metal-free ORR catalysts (Table S6, Supporting Information). The excellent ORR performance of Zn/Fe<sub>2</sub>-N-C is further confirmed by its significant higher current density (j) at 0.85 V (5.49 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>) than other catalysts (Fig 4(b), Table 1). For Zn/Fe<sub>3</sub>-N-C, due to the introduction of excessive hemin, defects of the whole self-assembly structure may lead to the decrease density of active sites, thus resulting in its slightly lower electrochemical properties compared with Zn/Fe<sub>2</sub>-N-C.

Besides, the Tafel slope of Zn/Fe<sub>2</sub>-N-C is 79 mV·dec<sup>-1</sup>, which is lower than that of the Pt/C (90 mV·dec<sup>-1</sup>) and Zn-N-C catalyst (99

mV·dec<sup>-1</sup>) (Fig. 4(c)), indicating a faster electron transfer rate. Furthermore, the reaction pathways and selectivity of intermediate products of three typical catalysts were detected by RRDE tests in the ORR process and the results as shown in Fig. 4(d). The electron transfer number (n) and hydrogen peroxide yield (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> %) of Zn/Fe<sub>2</sub>-N-C were 3.96 and 2.11 %, respectively, which were significantly better than Zn-N-C (2.88 and 56.08 %) and close to commercial 20 % Pt/C (3.97 and 1.32 %). It has been proved that Zn/Fe<sub>2</sub>-N-C catalyst has an highly efficient four-electron pathway and outstanding electrocatalytic selectivity. As expected, Zn/Fe<sub>2</sub>-N-C with a high specific surface area, hierarchical porous, high density of active sites and high graphitization degree has excellent ORR activity in alkaline media.

On the other hand, in order to explore the superiority of construction strategies of Zn/Fe2-N-C catalyst, the influence of ZIF precursor (ZIF-67), the combination of ZIF-8 and hemin (calcinationadsorption-calcination), the amount of 2-MEIM and acid treatment and other factors on ORR activity under alkaline conditions were further investigated. In Fig. S4(a) (Supporting Information), the E<sub>1/2</sub> and j<sub>L</sub> of Co/Fe<sub>2</sub>-N-C catalysts prepared by combining Co-ZIF precursor with hemin were 0.76 V and 3.75 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>, respectively, which were far lower than Zn/Fe<sub>2</sub>-N-C. The essential reason is that Zn<sup>2+</sup> can easily make pores at high temperature, which enables the Zn/Fe2-N-C catalyst to have a high specific surface area and hierarchical porous structure. Fig. S4(b), through carbonization of ZIF-8 precursors, part of graphitized carbon (Zn-N-C) with the best nitrogen doping and microporous structure was prepared, and hemin was adsorbed into the 3D carbon for thermal activation, etc., the as-prepared catalyst had a  $E_{1/2}$  of 0.81 V, far lower than

Zn/Fe<sub>2</sub>-N-C, indicating that the amount of 2-MEIM would slightly affect the physical structure of the catalyst. Fig. S4(d), after acid treatment, the  $E_{1/2}$  was only negatively shifted by 10 mV compared with Zn/Fe<sub>2</sub>-N-C, indicating that Fe atoms had been completely converted to Fe-N structure in Zn/Fe<sub>2</sub>-N-C catalyst. The above factors indicated that ZIF-8 is an ideal precursor, and the Zn/Fe<sub>2</sub>-N-C catalyst with excellent properties could be prepared by a facile room-temperature coprecipitation route and one-step thermal treatment.

As the most active catalyst, the stability test of the Zn/Fe<sub>2</sub>-N-C is further evaluated via chronoamperometric response (Fig. 4(e)). The Zn/Fe<sub>2</sub>-N-C catalyst still retained the initial current density of 92.2 % after 30000 s, whereas the Pt/C catalyst exhibits much higher current loss of 15.3 %. In addition, methanol crossover was measured by chronoamperometric response under the same condition with the addition of 3 M methanol. As shown in Fig. 4(f), the current density of Pt/C dropped sharply, whereas the current density is not sensitive to the addition of methanol in the case of the Zn/Fe<sub>2</sub>-N-C catalyst. This also indicates that the Zn/Fe<sub>2</sub>-N-C catalyst has excellent long-term stability and good methanol resistance, which is closely related to the stable bimetallic-ZIF structure.

Subsequently, the ORR properties of all catalysts in the acidic media were further studied. As shown in Fig. 5(a) and Table 1, Zn/Fe<sub>2</sub>-N-C also exhibits excellent ORR performance with E<sub>onset</sub> of 1.06 V, which is only 20 mV inferior than that of Pt/C (1.08 V) but much superior than those of Zn-N-C (0.84 V). And in Fig. 5(b), Zn/Fe<sub>2</sub>-N-C still had the optimal E<sub>1/2</sub> (0.81 V) and  $j_k$  (2.45 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>) at 0.85 V potential among the four as-obtained catalysts and was superior to 20 % Pt/C (0.80 V, and 1.19 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>). Notably, the ORR performance of Zn/Fe<sub>2</sub>-N-C outperforms most previous noblemetal-free electrocatalysts in a strong acidic media (Table S6).

In addition, the smaller Tafel slope of Zn/Fe<sub>2</sub>-N-C (84 mV·dec<sup>-1</sup>) than that of the Pt/C catalyst (85 mV·dec<sup>-1</sup>) also implies a fast ORR process (Fig. 5(c)). A low yield of  $H_2O_2$  (6.51 %) can be achieved for Zn/Fe<sub>2</sub>-N-C with a high electron-transfer number (3.87) (Fig. 5(d)), revealing a near four-electron-transfer process and good electrocatalytic selectivity over this catalyst. As is shown in Fig.5(e), the Zn/Fe<sub>2</sub>-N-C catalyst still remained at 85.6 % current rate after

40000 s, while that of 20 % Pt/C was only 36.5 %; after methanolisis added, the current decrease fluctuation influence on Pt/C is still much greater than that of Zn/Fe<sub>2</sub>-N-C (Fig. 5(f)). It was suggested that the Zn/Fe<sub>2</sub>-N-C catalyst maintained better stability and methanol resistance than Pt/C under acidic media.

According to the above ORR results, Zn/Fe<sub>2</sub>-N-C with a high electronic-transfer number (3.96, 0.1 M KOH; 3.87, 0.5 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>), and revealing that the ORR mechanism on Zn/Fe2-N-C is a fourelectron pathway. It can be inferred that the ORR process on the surface of electrocatalysts is a multi-step process<sup>9, 15, 38</sup>, as shown in Fig. 6.The O<sub>2</sub> molecules will first diffuse or adsorb to the surface of the catalyst to generate the adsorbed O2\* molecules, and then adsorbed O2\* molecules through a 2e or 4e means for the reduction process. According to the intrinsic properties of Zn/Fe<sub>2</sub>-N-C catalyst, its ORR reaction process in both alkaline and acidic media is the 4e<sup>-</sup> transfer way. It can undergo a more complex 4e<sup>-</sup> transfer process in the acidic media, resulting in a smaller electron transfer number than in the alkaline media. The adsorption process of OH on the surface of the catalyst has a key influence factor. Specially, if the binding energy of intermediate species (OH) with catalysts is too weak, it is easy to generate OOH; while if it is too strong, it is easy to detach the last step of OH on the surface of the catalyst. Due to the moderate adsorption capacity of OH, Zn/Fe<sub>2</sub>-N-C catalyst has a good ORR performance. Fig. 7 compares the  $E_{1/2}$ among the recently reported efficient noble-metal-free electrocatalysts<sup>34, 39-55</sup> and the corresponding preparation conditions, active sites and performance parameters of noblemetal ORR catalysts in both acidic and alkaline media have been summarized in Table S6. As observed, the Zn/Fe<sub>2</sub>-N-C shows a very high  $E_{1/2}$  in 0.1 M KOH and the highest  $E_{1/2}$  in 0.5 M  $H_2SO_4$ , which represents one of the best ORR performing ones among the noblemetal-free electrocatalysts reported to data in both alkaline and acidic media. Such a highly efficient ORR electrocatalyst can greatly reduce the catalyst cost, thus promoting the commercial application of fuel cells.

#### 3.4 Active sites in enhancing activity

The effect of annealing temperature (up to 1000 °C) on activity was further studied using the Fe<sub>2</sub>-ZIF-8 crystal precursors, and these LSV results under alkaline and acidic media are shown in Fig. S4(e-f) and summarized in Table 1. The effect of catalysts prepared at different temperatures on ORR activity showed the same trend in acid and alkaline media. When the heating treatment temperature was 700 °C, exhibited poor ORR activity and no formation of active sites. When the temperature was further increased to 800 °C, the catalyst started showing significant ORR activity. This suggests that 800 °C is the minimum temperature for generating active sites for the ORR. A higher temperature (up to 1000 °C) leads to a significant decrease in catalyst activity, which is not conducive to the formation of active sites because a large amount of Fe is wrapped by graphite carbon. Fig. S4(e), Zn/Fe<sub>2</sub>-N-C-700, Zn/Fe<sub>2</sub>-N-C-800 and Zn/Fe<sub>2</sub>-N-C-1000 samples show inferior ORR activity over the commercial Pt/C catalyst in terms of  $E_{1/2}$  (0.61 V, 0.77 V, 0.83 V vs 0.86 V, alkaline media), the trend is the same in acidic conditions (Fig. S4(f), Table 1). Zn/Fe<sub>2</sub>-N-C (Zn/Fe<sub>2</sub>-N-C-900) exhibited robust ORR activity in both media. To elucidate the new chemical bonds associated with this active site formation, the Fe<sub>2</sub>-ZIF-8 catalysts synthesized at varied temperatures were extensively characterized.

The correlation between ORR activity and Zn/Fe-N was firstly determined by XRD and XPS analysis. Fig. S1 (b) XRD pattern and XPS C 1s spectra show that when the pyrolysis temperature increases from 700 to 1000 °C, the graphitization degree of the crystalline phases gradually increasing. measurements further reveal the valence state and content of different elements in Zn/Fe2-N-C-Y catalysts (Fig. 3(c-e)), and summarized in Table S3-5 (Supporting Information). As shown in Fig. 3(c), increasing the annealing temperature results in a decline in the total N content due to the loss of pyridinic-N and pyrrolic-N. Oppositely, the content of graphitic N is increased. 800 °C was found to be the critical point for forming new Zn/Fe-N bonds, and at 900 °C the two nitrogen types of pyridine nitrogen and Zn/Fe-N reached their maximum proportions. These two forms of N were demonstrated to be favorable for ORR.56 In Fig. 3(d) and Table S3, the content of Zn decreases with the increase of the heating temperature of 700 ~ 900 °C, due to the volatilization of Zn at high temperature, resulting in the increase of specific surface area of Zn/Fe<sub>2</sub>-N-C-Y catalysts and formation of porous effectively doping of active sites. Up to 1000 °C, there are no discernable peaks in the Zn 2p XPS spectra, suggesting a thorough evaporation of Zn during annealing, leading in to the instability of the ZIF structure and the reduction of catalyst surface area. Zn-N<sub>x</sub> plays an important role in the stability of ZIF structure, and it has better electrochemical stability than Fe-N<sub>x</sub> during ORR process.<sup>37</sup> Fig. 3(e), Fe content is nearly independent of the heating temperature, however, it is closely related to pyridine N, Fe-N and porous structure of catalyst. Micropore-mesoporous are beneficial to Fe doping and the formation of Fe-N<sub>x</sub> active sites with pyridine N and Fe-N is beneficial to the stability of single atom Fe.

Thus, the excellent ORR activity in Zn/Fe<sub>2</sub>-N-C should be mainly contributed by the following aspects: i) In the selection of precursor materials, ZIF-8 is a ideal ORR precursor and hemin is a substance with an ORR active sites Fe-N<sub>4</sub> structure; ii) In the self-assembly process, the spatial separation of Fe<sup>2+</sup> within hemin by Zn<sup>2+</sup> can

effectively make the Fe-N<sub>x</sub> active sites form uniform distribution in the final catalyst, and this method also car avoid to vertor the influence of ZIF structure aperture; iii) During the pyrolysis, hierarchical porous and high surface area generated by partial evaporation of Zn²+ are beneficial to highest density pyridine and Fe-N, which provide nitrogen coordination sites for Fe to form Fe-N<sub>x</sub> and accessibility facilitating active sites access and mass transfer; meanwhile, the unique hydrocarbon-branched chains, Zn²+ and hemin in ZIF precursors can be directly converted into N-, Zn- and Fe-doped highly disordered carbon; iv) After the processes of pyrolysis, the residual Zn-N<sub>x</sub>-C and Fe-N<sub>x</sub>-C structures still maintained dodecahedral ZIF structure, which is of great significance for the electrochemical stability of ORR; and that high density Fe-N<sub>x</sub> and graphite N improve the geometric structure and electronic structure of carbon, which is benefial to ORR process.

#### 4. Conclusions

In summary, we have successfully synthesized a Zn/Fe<sub>2</sub>-N-C catalyst with high density atomically dispersed Fe-N<sub>x</sub> active sites and hierarchical porous structure (accessible active sites and mass transfer) by a facile coprecipitation-pyrolysis methods. Based on the control of hemin with ORR active sites in the ideal precursor of ZIF-8, the derived Zn/Fe-N-C catalysts was precisely regulated at selected temperature. As a result, the as-synthesized Zn/Fe<sub>2</sub>-N-C catalyst with atomically dispersed high density Fe-N<sub>x</sub> sites exhibits comparable ORR activity, better stability and superior methanol tolerance compared with the commercial Pt/C in alkaline and acidic media. Experimental results show that Zn-N<sub>x</sub> structure can make definite Fe-N<sub>x</sub> sites with x-coordinated configuration more stable, and Fe doping can significantly enhance ORR activity via an efficient almost four-electron process, resulting in excellent electrocatalytic activity and selectivity. This work can provide a new direction for the preparation of alternative Pt-based non-noble metal catalysts based on MOF, and Fe-Nx material with ORR active sites as precursor may be more effective in enhancing ORR activity.

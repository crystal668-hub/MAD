We present a novel approach to direct fabrication of few-layer graphene sheets with encapsulated Fe3C nanoparticles from pyrolysis of volatile non-graphitic precursors without any substrate. This one-step autoclave approach is facile and potentially scalable for production. Tested as an electrocatalyst, the graphene-based composite exhibited excellent catalytic activity towards the oxygen reduction reaction in alkaline solution with an onset potential of ca. 1.05 V (vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode) and a half-wave potential of 0.83 V, which is comparable to the commercial Pt/C catalyst.

Graphene, a single-layer carbon sheet with a hexagonal packed lattice structure, has generated a wide scientific interest because of its fascinating properties,[1] for example, strong mechanical strength,[2] extraordinarily high electrical and thermal conductivity,[3] huge specific area,[4] and good chemical, thermal, and electrochemical stabilities. These advantages make graphene and graphene-based composites of great potential for various applications.[5] Particularly in the field of energy storage and conversion, such as fuel cells,[6] solar cells,[7] lithium-ion batteries,[8] and supercapacitors,[9] their applications have attracted great attention. Of particular interest is their application as high-performance catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in fuel cells.[10]

For practical applications, graphene and its composites should be available from cost-effective and large-scale fabrication. Today, however, like in the early days of the carbon nanotube research, the availability of graphene is the bottle-neck for wide application of graphene.[11] Typically, solution-based methods like the modified Hummers method is the mostto graphene oxide and finally to graphene or chemically modified graphene.[12] This process is cost-effective but generally time-consuming with low yields. Another important method is the growth of graphene on metal substrates by chemical vapor deposition (CVD), which offers a viable route to electronic applications.[13] An interesting alternative approach is the socalled substrate-free gas-phase synthesis, where graphene sheets are synthesized by delivery of liquid alcohol droplets into microwave-generated argon plasmas.[14] Besides, other methods like micromechanical cleavage of graphite[1, 15] and vacuum graphitization of silicon carbide substrates[16] have also been developed. With the rapid progress of the field, a facile and cost-effective approach for production in large scale is still needed. Moreover, to functionalize pristine graphene materials for application as, for example, an ORR catalyst, post-treatments are usually needed by doping N atoms or depositing Pt nanoparticles on the graphene surface, imposing further challenges in terms of an even dispersion and stable attachment.[17]

widely used route to convert highly oriented pyrolytic graphite

Herein, we report a novel approach to direct fabrication of functionalized few-layer graphene by one-step high-temperature autoclave synthesis, without using any substrate, graphite precursor or sophisticated instruments. During the heat-treatment, few-layer graphene sheets functionalized with Fe3C nanoparticles are formed from decomposition of simple precursors, that is, cyanamide and ferrocene. The synthesis is facile and potentially scalable for production. On testing as an ORR catalyst, the composite exhibited excellent activity and stability in alkaline solution.

The finding of this new approach to fabrication of graphene-based composites was based on a recent work,[18] in which an Fe3C/C hollow sphere ORR catalyst was synthesized. During the further exploration of the synthesis, we obtained the present Fe3C-functionalized graphene composite catalyst (hereafter referred to as Fe3C-G), in which the carbon phase was primarily composed of curved graphene sheets. The morphology and structure of the Fe3C-G composite were first investigated by SEM and TEM. As shown in Figure 1 and Supporting information, Figure S2, curved graphene sheets like wrinkled silk are the dominant carbon phase in the composite. TEM (Figure 1 b and c) and dark field TEM images (Figure S2) reveal the uniform distribution of Fe3C nanoparticles in graphene sheets. Besides, some particle-free graphene sheets could also be found (Figure S3). Fe3C nanoparticles were examined by using high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) analysis. As shown in Figure 1 d, the crystalline lattice spacings were 2.26 and

2.10 Å for the two particles, corresponding to the (002) and (211) planes of the Fe<sub>3</sub>C phase, respectively. Based on the statistics of about 300 particles in several high-magnification TEM images, the average size of the Fe<sub>3</sub>C nanoparticles was estimated to be 10.5 nm with a narrow distribution (Figure S4). Compared with the hollow-sphere catalyst recently reported, [18] some spherical structures of approximately 300-500 nm in diameter could also be observed in the Fe<sub>3</sub>C-G composite (Figure 1); however, in a much decreased amount. Moreover, no carbon nanotubes could be found in the Fe<sub>3</sub>C–G.

The presence of graphene sheets were further verified with X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, and atomic force microscopy (AFM). As shown in Figure 2b, the diffraction peak at 26.5° corresponds to the (002) planes of graphene sheets, while the rest of diffraction peaks are characteristic of the crystalline planes of the Fe<sub>3</sub>C phase (JCPDS, No. 65-2411). The Raman spectrum for the Fe<sub>3</sub>C-G was similar to that previously reported for the few-layer graphene samples. [19] As seen from Figure 2c, compared with that for the graphite, the ratio of the

D (ca. 1356 cm<sup>-1</sup>) to G band (ca. 1580 cm<sup>-1</sup>) intensities ( $I_D/I_G$ ) was much greater, indicating edge defects in the graphene structure. The broad and asymmetric 2D peak at 2700  $\mbox{cm}^{-1}$  implied that the sample consists mainly of inhomogeneous fewlayer graphene sheets rather than single-layer graphene. [20] This was confirmed by AFM analysis (Figure 2a), clearly showing graphene sheets with an average thickness of about 3.0 nm. Assuming the theoretical thickness of a single-layer graphene to be approximately 0.6 nm, [21] this corresponds to about five single graphene layers.

The bulk elemental composition of the Fe<sub>3</sub>C-G composite was analyzed by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) (Figure 3 a and Figure S5), showing the presence of C

(84.4 wt%), Fe (12.8 wt%), and O (2.8 wt%). The iron content in the composite was also examined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA, Figure S6), showing an iron content of 12 wt %, in good agreement with the EDS result. With such high bulk Fe content, however, no visible surface Fe signal was observed by means of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). As shown in Figure 3 b, the XPS spectrum survey reveals the presence of only C (83.7 at.%) and O (15.6 at.%) with a very small amount of N (0.70 at.%). The high-resolution spectrum of Fe-2p (Figure 3c) confirmed the absence of surface Fe functionalities, indicating that Fe<sub>3</sub>C nanoparticles were encapsulated by graphene sheets. This encapsulation structure was further checked by leaching the Fe<sub>3</sub>C-G powder in 0.5 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> solution at 85 °C for 9 h. Since the pure Fe<sub>3</sub>C phase is soluble in acid, [22] only if protected by graphene layers can it survive during the leaching process. As shown in Figure 2b and Figure S7, little difference was observed for the corresponding XRD pattern and TEM image after the leaching process. In addition, the high-resolution N-1 s spectrum (Figure 3 d) reveals four main N-species: pyridinic-, pyrolic-, quaternary, and oxidized N. The nitrogen content is as low as that of the hollow sphere catalyst previously reported (ca. 0.5 at.%).

The performance of the Fe<sub>3</sub>C-G composite as an ORR catalyst was investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) in either O<sub>2</sub>-free or O<sub>2</sub>-saturated 0.1 м КОН solution. The result was compared with that of the Pt/C catalyst. As shown in Figure 4a, the voltammetric response of Fe<sub>3</sub>C-G in O<sub>2</sub>-free KOH showed a featureless curve, without the typical peaks associated with iron-containing species. [23] In the O2-saturated solution, the CV for the Fe<sub>3</sub>C-G showed an intense ORR peak with the peak potential of 0.85 V, the same as that of the commercial Pt/C catalyst (Figure 4a). The rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) was further employed to investigate the kinetics of ORR on the Fe<sub>3</sub>C-G electrode. Polarization curves were obtained by scanning the potential from 1.1 to 0.2 V at a scan rate of 10 mV s<sup>-1</sup> (Figure 4b). It showed that the ORR activities of the Fe<sub>3</sub>C-G and Pt/C catalysts were close in terms of onset potential (~1.05 V) and half-wave potential (~0.83 V), with only a minor difference in the limiting currents. The RRDE analysis disclosed the reason for the lower limiting current of the Fe<sub>3</sub>C-G catalyst, which showed a relatively high H2O2 yield (  $\approx$  20%) in the limiting current region for the Fe<sub>3</sub>C–G. This H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> yield corresponded to an electron-transfer number of 3.7, indicating a mixed ORR pathway. Another approach using the Koutecky-Levich (K-L) equation was also employed to assess the ORR pathway of the Fe<sub>3</sub>C-G. As shown in Figure 4c and d, the electron-transfer numbers determined from the K-L plots were approximately 3.8 in the limiting current region, in good agreement with the RRDE analysis. Recently, Kim et al.[24] synthesized iron and nitrogenfunctionalized graphene nanosheets and speculated that the graphene nanosheets contribute to the ORR

performance due to the high degree of nitrogen-doped edge plane exposure. In the present work, however, the nitrogen doping level of the Fe<sub>3</sub>C-G catalyst is too low to play a significant role in ORR. Considering the similar encapsulation structure of Fe<sub>3</sub>C-G with the hollow sphere catalyst previously reported, [18] the Fe<sub>3</sub>C–G catalyst could present a similar ORR mechanism, that is, there might be a synergetic effect between protective graphene sheets and the encapsulated Fe<sub>3</sub>C nanoparticles, which is responsible for the high ORR activity and stability of the Fe<sub>3</sub>C-G catalyst.

The stability of the Fe<sub>3</sub>C-G and Pt/C catalysts was assessed with chronoamperometirc (CA) measurements. As depicted in Figure 4e, the current-time curve for the Fe<sub>3</sub>C-G exhibits a slow attenuation and high current retention (70%) after 16 h. In comparison, the Pt/C catalyst showed a much faster current decrease with only 58% retention after 16 h. The methanol tolerance is another concern for ORR catalysts. As shown in Figure 3 d, the original ORR current of the Fe<sub>3</sub>C-G did not change when 10 vol% methanol was added into the electrolyte solution. In comparison, the corresponding current on the Pt/C catalyst shifted from a cathodic current to a reversed anodic current in a very short time after the methanol addition.

The arrow indicates the introduction of 10 vol % methanol. The catalyst loading was 0.6 mg cm<sup>-2</sup> for Fe<sub>3</sub>C–G catalyst and 0.25 mg cm<sup>-2</sup> (50  $\mu$ g<sub>(Pt)</sub>cm<sup>-2</sup>) for Pt/ C catalyst.

In summary, we found a direct approach to fabricate a graphene-based composite in form of graphene sheets functionalized with Fe<sub>3</sub>C nanoparticles. The synthesis, as achieved by high temperature autoclave pyrolysis of volatile precursors without any substrate, is facile and potentially scalable for production. Tested as an ORR electrocatalyst, the composite showed excellent electrocatalytic activity and stability in alkaline solution. Compared with the Pt/C catalyst, it exhibited the same ORR onset (1.05 V) and half-wave potential (0.83 V) with additional methanol tolerance.

## **Experimental Section:**

The precursors, cyanamide ( $CN_2H_2$ ) (99%) and ferrocene ( $Fe(C_5H_5)_2$ ) (98%), were purchased from Sigma Aldrich and used as received. A homemade 3.3 mL autoclave was assembled from stainless steel parts. A specially designed quartz cup was placed in the autoclave, and the precursors were inserted into it. For the synthesis of Fe<sub>3</sub>C– G, cyanamide (0.587 g) and ferrocene (0.065 g) were mixed and introduced into the autoclave at room temperature in a nitrogenfilled glove-box. The autoclave was closed in the glove box and then placed at the center of a tube-furnace under a N<sub>2</sub> flow. The temperature of the furnace was raised to 800°C at a rate of 10°Cmin<sup>-1</sup> and maintained at this temperature for 3 h. After that, the furnace was gradually cooled at ca. 1 °C min<sup>-1</sup> to room temperature. With this high precursor load, the autogenerated pressure in the autoclave exceeded the pressure limit of the autoclave, leading to an unexpected leakage during the pyrolysis. After the heattreatment, there is a ca. 30% weight loss relative to the weight of starting precursors. Only with this leakage process can we obtain the Fe<sub>3</sub>C–G sample. The final product yield was ca. 30% (the yield was defined by the weight of solid product obtained relative to the weight of starting precursors). The leaking process is inexact; however, the synthesis has been reproduced with five batches and all have been tested in terms of catalyst morphology and ORR performance.

Powder XRD measurements were performed with a PW1700 diffractometer (Philips Co.) using a CuK  $_{\!\alpha}$  ( $\!\lambda\!=\!1.5405\,\mbox{\normalfon}$  ) radiation source. TEM images and the corresponding energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) images were obtained with JEM-3000F (FEGTEM) at 300 kV. SEM images and the corresponding EDS spectra were taken on a LEO 1525 FE-SEM scanning electron microscope. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were carried out on a Kratos XSAM-800 spectrometer with an MgK<sub>a</sub> radiation source. The thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were carried out on a NETZSCH TGA-STA 409 PC analyzer. AFM imaging was performed in the tapping mode using a 5500AFM system (Agilent Technologies, Chandler, AZ).

Electrochemical measurements were conducted using the 760C Bipotentiostat (CH Instruments). The Fe<sub>3</sub>C-G catalyst ink was prepared by ultrasonically dispersing the Fe<sub>3</sub>C-G catalyst (10 mg) in a suspension containing Nafion (80 µL, 5 wt%) solution and ethanol (514 μL). The Pt/C catalyst (20 wt% Pt on Vulcan XC72R carbon, Johnson Matthey) ink was prepared by dispersing the catalyst (5 mg) ultrasonically in a mixture solution containing Nafion (50 µL, 5 wt%) solution, ethanol (600 μL) and Milli-Q water (400 μL). Catalyst loadings on RRDE (0.196 cm $^{-2}$ ) were 0.6 mg cm $^{-2}$  for Fe $_3$ C-G catalyst and 50  $\mu g_{(Pt)} \ cm^{-2}$  for Pt/C catalyst. A conventional threeelectrode cell was employed incorporating a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the reference electrode, a Pt wire as the counter electrode, and the catalyst film coated RRDE as the working electrode. The electrolyte was 0.1 M KOH solution. RRDE measurements were conducted by liner sweep voltammetry (LSV) from 1.1 V to 0.2 V at a scan rate of 10 mV s<sup>-1</sup> at 900 rpm, while the ring electrode was held at 1.2 V vs. RHE (reversible hydrogen electrode). All the ORR currents presented in the figures are Faradaic currents, that is, after correction for the capacitive current. The following equations (Equation 1,2) were used to calculate n (the apparent number of electrons transferred during ORR) and % H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (the percentage of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> released during ORR).

$$n = \frac{4I_{\rm D}}{I_{\rm D} + (I_{\rm R}/N)} \tag{1}$$

$$\%H_{2}O_{2} = 100\frac{2I_{R}/N}{I_{D} + (I_{R}/N)} \tag{2}$$

where  $I_D$  is the Faradaic current at the disk,  $I_R$  the Faradaic current at the ring and N (0.254) is the  $H_2O_2$  collection coefficient at the ring. The apparent number of electrons transferred for ORR was also determined by the Koutechy-Levich equation given blow

$$\frac{1}{J} = \frac{1}{J_{\rm l}} + \frac{1}{J_{\rm k}} = \frac{1}{B\omega^{1/2}} + \frac{1}{J_{\rm k}} \tag{3}$$

$$B = 0.62nFC_0(D_0)^{2/3}v^{-\frac{1}{6}} \tag{4}$$

where J is the measured current density,  $J_{K}$  is the kinetic current density,  $J_{\rm L}$  is the diffusion-limited current density,  $\omega$  is the electrode rotation rate, F is Faraday constant (96485 C mol<sup>-1</sup>),  $C_0$  is the bulk concentration of O<sub>2</sub> in 0.1 M KOH solution (1.2×10<sup>-3</sup> mol L<sup>-1</sup>),  $D_0$  is the diffusion coefficient of  $O_2$  in 0.1 M KOH (1.9×10<sup>-5</sup> cm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>) and  $\nu$  is the kinetic viscosity of the electrolyte (0.01 cm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> for 0.1 M KOH solution).[25] In all figures, the potentials were converted to values versus the RHE. All experiments were carried out at about

Direct Synthesis of Fe3C-Functionalized Graphene by High Temperature Autoclave Pyrolysis for Oxygen Reduction

Ironclad approach: A novel approach is reported for the direct fabrication of few-layer graphene functionalized with Fe3C nanoparticles. The synthesis, achieved by high temperature autoclave pyrolysis of volatile precursors without any substrate, is facile and potentially scalable for production. Tested as an electrocatalyst, the composite showed excellent electrocatalytic activity and stability for the oxygen reduction reaction.

**One-dimensional (1D) ultrafine nanowires of different materials, especially noble metals, present an enticing prospect for catalyst applications due to their numerous active sites exposed. However, the controllable synthesis and stability issues hinder their practical applications. Herein, single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) are adopted as the template to synthesize and stabilize ultrafine nanowires of metals. Furthermore, the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is employed as an application demonstration. Impressively, the as prepared PdMo nanowires exhibit a half-wave potential of 0.923 V and the mass activity is 35 times and 130 times higher than those of commercial Pt/C and Pd/C catalysts, respectively. Because of the protection, a superior ORR durability with 50 000 cycles can be achieved. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the SWCNTs surface can be activated by the encapsulated PdMo NWs to achieve the exclusive adsorption of O2 and the following reduction reaction. In addition, PdMo NWs@SWCNTs demonstrate excellent catalytic performance as the cathode of lithium-oxygen batteries. The cell can reach a high discharge capacity of over 10 000 mAh g<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> , better than most of the former reported catalytic electrodes. The tailored design PdMo NWs@SWCNTs show widespread applications in various energy storage & conversion fields.**

enable various types of applications.[1] Different from their bulk counterparts, 1D ultrafine nanowires are expected to exhibit entirely different physical and chemical properties. For example, Toshihiko et al.[2] synthesized 1D ultrafine sulfur chains with metallic properties, despite the insulation characteristics of bulk sulfur. In spite of those remarkable properties, there remain many difficulties to develop 1D nanostructure materials. It is almost impossible to form a 1D ultrafine structure without an external driving force which can initiate and sustain anisotropic growth. In addition, the intrinsic instability of 1D ultrafine nanowires raises a huge challenge for the practical applications as well. The nanowires tend to agglomerate spontaneously and are sensitive to the surroundings.[3] Taking Pd nanowires as an example,[4] the nanowires are vulnerable to erosion due to the oxidative etching of oxygen in surrounding environment.

Especially, 1D ultrafine nanowires have drawn great attention in the area of catalysis due to their numerous active sites exposed. However, the interaction between the ultrafine nanomaterials and the contacting chemical species such as reactants and solvents during catalysis makes them either agglomerated or etched, thus, gradually losing the catalytic activity. Using ultrathin carbon as the protection layer to avoid the direct contact with the surroundings is an effective method to stabilize nanoparticles. More importantly, ultrafine carbon layers have been proved to be transparent to inner guest.[5] However, the applicability of this method to 1D ultrafine nanowires and the effect of the carbon on the catalysis process have been seldom studied previously. Owing to the unique 1D hollow structure and characteristic, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been widely studied since they were discovered.[1b,2,6] CNTs have been successfully demonstrated in an experiment to encapsulate metals and molecules due to their capillarity,[3,7] which can be described as chain mail for inner metal compounds to protect it from corrosive environment. Their applications in various catalytic reactions and the corresponding catalytic mechanism need more explorations.[8]

Herein, a novel strategy was used to synthesize Mo doped Pd ultrafine nanowires using SWCNTs with internal diameters as small as 1–2 nm as templates. ORR was used as the demonstration to show the protection of carbon layer to the 1D ultrafine nanowires and the effect of carbon layers on the catalysis **www.advancedsciencenews.com www.advenergymat.de**

process. ORR was chosen since its sluggish kinetic process makes it the rate-determining and cost-determining part for fuel cell and metal-air batteries.[9] To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time to apply confined ultrafine binarymetal nanowires in ORR. SWCNTs can suppress a potential structural instability of the enclosed 1D nanowire because of the high stability of sp2 carbon bonds. In particular, Mo doped Pd nanowires inside SWCNTs (noted as PdMo NWs@ SWCNTs) with the length of tens of nanometers and width of ≈2 nm show superior ORR performance with a half-wave potential of 0.923 V and a large electrochemically active surface area of 111.46 m g2 Pd −1 . The mass activity is 6.13 A mgPd <sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> at 0.9 volts versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (vs RHE) in alkaline electrolytes, which is 35 times and 130 times higher than those of commercial Pt/C and Pd/C catalyst respectively. Owing to the physical protection effect of CNTs, PdMo NWs have no direct contact with the reaction medium to avoid corrosion, thus, showing unprecedented superior stability with 50000 cycles. According to DFT calculation, the SWCNTs surface can be activated by the encapsulated NWs to achieve the exclusive adsorption of O2 and the following reduction reaction. It is well known that, Li–O2 batteries, which rely on the reaction of lithium and oxygen (2Li<sup>+</sup> + 2e– + O2 ↔ Li2O2), have attracted extensive attention in recent years due to their high theoretical energy density. However, its practical application is seriously limited by the poor catalytic performance of cathodes. PdMo NWs@SWCNTs as a cathode in Li–O2 batteries show good stability, promising for the practical applications.

# **2. Results and Discussion**

As depicted in **Figure 1**, PdMo NWs@SWCNTs were synthesized through the vapor filling method by using the capillarity of SWCNTs. First, high-temperature annealing pretreatment of SWCNTs was used to remove their terminating caps.[3,6h] Then, Pd(acac)2 and MoO2(acac)2 were inserted into SWCNTs in a vacuum. After subsequent pyrolysis, they decomposed and reassembled into PdMo ultrafine NWs because of the constraint of SWCNTs along the tube axis (see EXPERIMENTAL SECTION for details). As characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (**Figure 2**a,b and Figure S1, Supporting Information), the product is dominated by 1D nanowires inside the hollow cores of SWCNTs with a diameter of ≈1.9 nm and length up to 55 nm (Figure S2a,b, Supporting Information), curved with SWCNTs axis (Figure 2b). No nanoparticle is observed outside of SWCNTs and the TEM images show that the SWCNTs are still intact after PdMo NWs filling (Figure S2c,d, Supporting Information). As previously reported in the literature,[7] CNTs could be filled by metals and molecules due to their capillarity. Since the adsorption performance is spontaneous and the product is more stable, the desorption process will be difficult. Also, once the volatile precursors are decomposed into metal inside the CNTs, it will be hard to be removed. According to the energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) results conducted from eight different PdMo NWs (Figure S3, Supporting Information), the content of Mo in different NWs is very close, indicating the homogenous distribution of Mo in different NWs.[10] Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) analysis (Figure S4, Supporting Information) further confirms that no single atoms are existent in the resulting samples. Inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES) was further used to determine the precise loading amount of metal elements, where the atomic percent of Pd is 1.32% and Mo is 0.15%, respectively. This is also consistent with the result of TEM-EDS (Figure S3i, Supporting Information). The diameter of the synthesized PdMo NWs is mainly within 1–2 nm (Figure S3, Supporting Information). In order to present the atomic structure clearly, we chose a nanowire with a diameter of 4 nm for STEM characterizations in purpose. A high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image shows the spacing lattice fringes are ≈0.23nm (Figure 2c and Figure S5, Supporting Information), a bit larger than Pd (111) plane (0.22 nm), which can be attributed to the doping effect of Mo atoms.[10] We further applied Raman to confirm the structure of the outer carbon layer before and after PdMo NWs loading (Figure 2d). Radial breathing mode (RBM) is located around 150 cm–1, indicating that the diameter of SWCNTs is ≈2 nm. After encapsulating the PdMo, the G peak of SWCNTs is still very strong and very sharp, confirming that the carbon layer is still intact, which will lead to a good protection of the inside ultrafine NWs.

Compared with pure SWCNTs, three more peaks are shown in the powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of PdMo NWs@SWCNTs (Figure 2e), which can be assigned to the (111), (200), and (220) peaks of PdMo metal. These peaks are apparently broadened due to the ultrafine nature of NWs, further confirming the absence of large particles outside SWCNTs. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was further applied to investigate the valence state of PdMo NWs@SWCNTs. The two peaks of Pd 3d spectra locate around 335.8 and 341.1 eV, corresponding to the 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 peaks, respectively (Figure 2f). The position of these peaks is between Pd0 and Pd2<sup>+</sup>, indicating the strong charge transfer from Pd to carbon layer.[5,8] In contrast (Figure S6, Supporting Information), Mo element shows a mixed valence of Mo0, Mo+<sup>4</sup> , and Mo<sup>+</sup>6, which might be due to the stronger reducibility of Mo.[12] Again, the positive shift of the Mo0 peaks can be attributed to the electron transfer effect (from metal to carbon).[2,11,13] Subsequently, DFT simulation was conducted to investigate the electronic structure of surface carbon layer. As a comparison, Pd@SWCNTs and Mo@SWCNTs were also constructed. The partial density of states (Figure S7a, Supporting Information) shows that the

p-band center of C active sites in PdMo NWs@SWCNTs shifts to the lowest position (−6.67 eV), caused by the accepting electrons from the PdMo NWs with an n-type doping effect.[14] Quantified Bader Charge analysis was applied to further confirm the electron transfer process (Figure S7b, Supporting Information). They all exhibit a positive Bader charge due to the electron transfer from metal to the outer carbon layer.[15] It is obvious that the charge rearrangement is significant in PdMo NWs@SWCNTs surface (Figure S8, Supporting Information), meaning the larger decrease of local work function. In other words, carbon layer turns to be more active after encapsulating PdMo NWs.[5a,b,15–16]

Next, the electrocatalytic performance of PdMo NWs@SWCNTs was investigated through the traditional three electrode method in O2-saturated 0.1M KOH. The rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) was used as working electrode. As the ORR polarization curves display (**Figure 3**a), the PdMo NWs@SWCNTs show more positive shift compared to other catalysts with a better half-wave potential (*E*1/2 = 0.923 V), implying it possesses an enhanced ORR activity. For reference, Pd@SWCNTs (*E*1/2 = 0.85 V), commercial Pt/C (*E*1/2 = 0.83 V) and Pd/C (*E*1/2 = 0.80 V) were also tested. It is interesting that even the performance of Pd@SWCNTs (9.5 wt% Pd) (Figure S9, Supporting Information) is better than Pt/C (10 wt% Pt), which might be attributed to the highly exposed active sites and the interaction with carbon of Pd@SWCNTs. As expected, the Mo@SWCNTs show no ORR activity. Apparently, the increased ORR activity of PdMo NWs@SWCNTs is aroused by the doping effect of Mo atoms and the rearranged electron state of the outer carbon layer, which can modulate the performance of catalyst on electron level.[5a,8] The Tafel slopes of each catalyst were calculated from LSV curves (Figure 3b). PdMo NWs@SWCNTs exhibit a slope of 53 mV dec–1, smaller than Pd@SWCNTs (72 mV dec–1), commercial Pt/C (77 mV dec–1) and Pd/C (83 mV dec–1), indicating a faster ORR kinetic property. To further analyze the ORR activity, we normalized the current density with the loading amount of noble metal in the catalyst (Figure 3c). The mass activity of PdMo NWs@SWCNTs is 6.13 amperes per mgpd at 0.9 V versus RHE in alkaline electrolyte, which is 35 times and 130 times greater than those of commercial Pt/C (0.173 A per mgPt at 0.9 V vs RHE) and Pd/C (0.047 A per mgPd at 0.9 V vs RHE) catalysts, respectively, and is also superior to other ORR catalysts reported (Table S1, Supporting Information).[12a,17] Electrochemically active surface areas (ECSAs) of different catalysts were also determined by underpotentially deposited hydrogen (Hupd), underpotentially deposited copper (Cuupd) and Pd oxide reduction (EXPERI-MENTAL SECTION, Figure 3d and Figure S10a–n, Supporting Information). The ECSAs are not quite the same by different methods, however, all the different test methods show that PdMo NWs@SWCNTs have significant higher ECSAs than commercial Pd/C or Pt/C (Table S2, Supporting Information). These results further confirm the ultrafine structure of PdMo NWs@SWCNTs. In addition, the oxygen reduction pathway of PdMo NWs@SWCNTs was investigated by ring and disk current in RRDE. As shown in Figure 3e, the H2O2 yield of **www.advancedsciencenews.com www.advenergymat.de**

PdMo NWs@SWCNTs, similar to commercial Pt/C catalyst, is below 5%, significantly lower than Pd/C catalyst. The electron transfer number *n* is ≈3.97 according to Koutecký–Levich (K–L) equation plots (Figure S10o,p, Supporting Information) obtained from the polarization curves at different rotation rates. This indicates that a four-electron transfer pathway from O2 to OH– happens on PdMo NWs@SWCNTs surface. Surprisingly, as shown in Figure S11a, Supporting Information, when lowing metal loading amount to 0.13 ug, PdMo NWs@SWCNTs still appear very good activity, which is much better than commercial Pd/C and Pt/C. The decreased amount of noble metal used will decrease the cost, which is very important for practical applications. For further comparison, PdMo NWs@SWCNTs with more Mo elements were carried out as well and showed inferior performance, meaning that extra Mo element will not improve ORR performance further (Figure S11b, Supporting Information).

In addition to superior ORR catalytic activity, electrochemical durability was further assessed via CV cycling at 50 mV s–1 in O2-saturated 0.1M KOH. LSV curves after 10 000, 30 000, and 50 000 cycles are shown in Figure 3f. The E1/2 and Tafel slope of the LSV after 10 000 cycles are slightly better than the initial one, and then tend to be stable (Figure 3g), which should be attributed to the enhanced infiltration between electrolyte and SWCNTs. PdMo NWs are protected by SWCNTs from being leached and from aggregating during cycling.[18] This is a major advantage compared with conventional nanowires exposing to electrolyte directly (Figure S11c,d, Supporting Information). PdMo nanoparticles on SWCNTs (noted as PdMo NPs/C) was further applied for comparison. Although the initial *E*1/2 is 0.88 V, it is decayed by 30 mV after only 5000 cycles, indicating the stability advantages of the PdMo NWs@SWCNTs (Figure S11d, Supporting Information). To further verify the morphology stability, TEM images of PdMo NWs@SWCNTs after cycling

were taken. As expected, the morphology of nanowires remains almost unchanged (Figure 2b and Figure S12, Supporting Information). Also, the G peak of PdMo NWs@SWCNTs after cycling is very strong as ever, demonstrating the stability of SWCNTs after the durability test. Although the carbon material is easy to be etched under continuous applying potential, the etch process will be very slow for CNTs with few defects.

The novel PdMo NWs@SWCNTs sample was also employed as the cathode of Li–O2 batteries to further demonstrate its practicability (Figure S13a, Supporting Information). Cyclic voltammetry was adopted to evaluate the ORR and OER catalytic activities of the PdMo NWs@SWCNTs cathode. As shown in Figure S13b, Supporting Information, the high reduction peak and oxidation peak demonstrate superior ORR/OER bifunctional catalyst activity of the cathode, which may promote the electrochemical performance of the Li–O2 batteries. As expected, the PdMo NWs@SWCNTs catalyzed Li–O2 batteries yield a high discharge capacity over 10000 mAh g–1 with two long discharge/ charge voltage plateaus, indicating excellent catalytic characters for ORR and OER (Figure S13c, Supporting Information). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) test was also conducted to assess the reversibility of the electrode. As shown clearly in Figure S13d, Supporting Information, the sharp increase of *R*ct after discharge is related to the formation of insulated discharge product Li2O2. Fortunately, the *R*ct decreases rapidly after recharge process because of the decomposition of Li2O2, which illustrates the outstanding reversibility of the cells. Cycle performance of the battery was also observed to further estimate the catalytic stability of the PdMo NWs@SWCNTs electrode. As shown in **Figure 4**a,b, the polarization during long cycle shows an insignificant increase, indicating the cycle stability. Furthermore, the cell can achieve 243 stable cycles with the limited capacity of 500 mAh g–1 and more than 105 stable cycles with the capacity fixed at 1000 mAh g–1 (Figure 4c,d). Surprisingly, the cycle times exceeded 800 and 700 hours, respectively (Figure S14, Supporting Information). To the best of our knowledge, the cycle life of the cell is superior to most of the former reported materials (Figure 4e and Table S3, Supporting Information). The

(a) Optimized adsorption configurations of O2, \*OOH, \*O, \*OH, and H2O on PdMo(111) NWs@SWCNTs, as well as the calculated free energy diagram for 4e– ORR pathways in alkaline conditions under the electrode potential of *U* = 0.00 and 1.23 V, versus reverse hydrogen electrode (RHE), for PdMo(111) NWs@SWCNTs, Pd(111)@SWCNTs and Mo(111)@SWCNTs systems, respectively. (b) Adsorption energy of O2 on the surface of different electrocatalyst.

superior electrochemical performances of the battery should be attributed to the excellent ORR catalytic activity of the tailored design cathode of PdMo NWs@SWCNTs.

DFT calculations were carried out to further reveal the surface reaction mechanism of ORR reaction over surface carbon layer of SWCNTs encapsulating PdMo NWs. Here, the Pd (111), Mo (111), and PdMo NWs (111) surfaces with the carbon layer were built up, and the free energy diagrams during the fourelectron oxygen reduction pathway were obtained through DFT calculations. The free energy diagrams of the ORR process on PdMo NWs@SWCNTs, Pd@SWCNTs, and Mo@SWCNTs are shown in **Figure 5**a and Figure S15, Supporting Information. When *U* = 0, all the ORR processes are exothermic with negative values for the free energy change (Δ*G*). Afterward, these elementary reactions will gradually become endothermic with the electrode potential increases. Therefore, the overpotential can be derived by keeping all the elementary reactions exothermic. Mo (111)@SWCNTs possess an ultrahigh overpotential of 1.22 V, implying their extremely poor catalytic activity. In contrast, the PdMo (111)@SWCNTs appear to have a lower overpotential of 0.52 V than Pd (111)@SWCNTs (0.67 V), suggesting the ORR catalytic performance is effectively promoted by Mo doping. When *U* = 1.23V, the ΔG of rate-determining step of ORR process, O2 + \* + H<sup>+</sup> + e– →\*OOH, of PdMo NWs@ SWCNTs is smaller than Pd@SWCNTs and Mo@SWCNTs. This could be attributed to exclusive moderate adsorption of O2 on carbon surface, which is confirmed by adsorption energy of O2 on the surface of different electrocatalyst (Figure 5b). Besides, O2 could barely adsorb on the surface of pure SWCNTs. It indicates that the SWCNTs surface is activated by the encapsulated PdMo NWs to achieve the exclusive adsorption of O2, which could accelerate ORR kinetic property. Besides, the step (\*O + H<sup>+</sup> + e– → \*OH) of PdMo NWs@SWCNTs becomes negative, indicating an optimized energy barrier and ORR activity of PdMo NWs@SWCNTs.[19] By calculating the valence charge density difference of PdMo NWs@SWCNTs, Pd@SWCNTs, and Mo@SWCNTs after adsorbing \*O (Figure S16, Supporting Information), which is one of the most sluggish step of ORR kinetic process, the charge rearrangement of PdMo NWs (111)@SWCNTs is more obvious. This illustrates that the encapsulated PdMo NWs make the charge distribution at the SWCNTs surface more polarized. The in-depth mechanism of the enhancement in ORR activities can be corroborated by the p-band center theory (Figure S7a, Supporting Information). The position of p-band center is related to the filling of anti-bonding state near Fermi level, which determines the binding strength of intermediates involved in ORR catalytic activities. The p-band center (−3.17 eV) of Mo (111)@SWCNTs is closest to the Fermi level, indicating the strongly over-binding of intermediates consists of the most negative O2 adsorption energy on the carbon surface, which results in its poor catalytic activity. While the p-band center of carbon active site in PdMo (111)@SWCNTs shifts to a lower position (−6.67 eV) compared with that of Pd (111)@SWCNTs (−6.10 eV), indicating the over-binding is alleviated by effectively accepting the electrons from the PdMo NWs.[14a] These results imply that the remarkable ORR catalytic activity of PdMo NWs@SWCNTs is attributed to the optimal binding strength between intermediates and carbon by a partially filled anti-bonding state. As Bader charge is shown in Figure S7b, Supporting Information, the electron transfer in PdMo (111)@SWCNTs (1.07 eV) is much stronger than that in Pd (111)@SWCNTs (0.41eV) and Mo (111)@SWCNTs (0.19 eV). Shortly, the top carbon layer can be activated by the underlying metal species due to the electron transfer, which will be inspiring for the design of stable catalysts.[20]

# **3. Conclusions**

In summary, a facile strategy to synthesize PdMo ultrafine nanowires inside SWCNTs is developed. Because of the protection of SWCNTs surface but transparency to inner guest, PdMo NWs@SWCNTs get a great performance in ORR activity. Besides, the confinement effect introduces a charge transfer

between the SWCNTs protector shell and the guest PdMo NWs. DFT calculations demonstrate that the strong interaction between PdMo NWs and inner wall of SWCNTs dramatically modulates the electron structure of carbon layer, which accelerates the ORR process on the surface carbon layer of PdMo NWs@SWCNTs. Mo doping could promote ORR activity by optimizing the binding strength with intermediates by a less filled anti-bonding state. Owing to the confinement effect of outer SWCNTs, PdMo ultrafine NWs are protected from contacting the reaction medium directly, thereby, possessing a superior performance in duration without decay after 50 000 potential cycles. Moreover, PdMo NWs@SWCNTs display promising performance as the cathode in Li-O2 batteries with a high discharge capacity over 10 000 mAh g<sup>-1</sup> and stable cycle performance. The new facile strategy to synthesize confined ultrafine NWs may enable opportunities for designing and exploring various efficient and durable catalysts for energy-related applications.

#### 4. Experimental Section

Materials: SWCNTs were produced by floating catalytic process, bought from XFNANO Materials Tech Co., Ltd. Before use, SWCNTs needed to be annealed at 530 °C for 30 min in air to open the closed ends and remove residual amorphous carbon impurities. Palladium (II) acetylacetonate (Pd(acac)<sub>2</sub>) was used as palladium precursor (Acros). Bis (acetylacetonato) dioxomolybdenum (VI) (MoO<sub>2</sub>(acac)<sub>2</sub>) was used as molybdenum precursor (Aladdin).

Synthesis of the PdMo NWs@SWCNTs: First, Pd(acac) $_2$  (30 mg 0.098 mmol), MoO $_2$ (acac) $_2$  (10 mg 0.031mmol) and pretreated SWCNTs (25 mg) were sealed together under a vacuum of  $10^{-5}$  mbar in quartz ampoule, and then heated at 150 °C for 3 days in a muffle furnace. After annealing, the ampoule was cooled in ice water immediately. Then, the ampoule was broken and the black powder was collected. The powder was further washed by methylbenzene and ethanol with ultrasonic cleaning and centrifugal collection to remove residual precursor outside of SWCNTs. At last, the black powder was annealed at 500 °C for 1 h in a hydrogen argon atmosphere, and then gradually cooled down to room temperature. The final black powder of PdMo NWs@SWCNTs was obtained.

Synthesis of the Pd@SWCNTs: The Pd@SWCNTs were synthesized by following the same protocol for the synthesis of the PdMo NWs@SWCNTs, except only Pd(acac)<sub>2</sub> (30 mg 0.098 mmol) was added in the first step.

Synthesis of the Mo@SWCNTs: The Mo@SWCNTs were synthesized by following the same protocol for the synthesis of the PdMo NWs@SWCNTs, except only  $MoO_2(acac)_2$  (30 mg 0.092 mmol) was added in the first step.

Structure Characterization: The morphologies of PdMo NWs@ SWCNTs were captured in JEM-2100F apparatus operated at 200 kV. Aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy analysis was carried out by JEM Grand ARM300F microscope under the accelerating voltage of 300 kV. Energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) was further applied to analyze the chemical composition of PdMo NWs@SWCNTs. XRD patterns were obtained on a Bruker X-ray diffractometer (D8 Advance) with Cu K $\alpha$  radiation. The composition of each catalyst was measured by ICP-OES (Agilent ICPOES730). XPS was used to characterize the chemical composition and chemical states of the samples, and the patterns were carried out using a Thermo Scientific Escalab 250Xi facility. Raman spectra were collected in a Jobin-Yvon LabSpec iHR 550 Raman spectrometer with 532 nm laser excitation at room temperature. EXAFS measurements at the Pd K-edge was carried out at 21A X-ray nanodiffraction beamline of Taiwan Photon Source (TPS), National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center (NSRRC), in which the X-ray beam was monochromatized with water-cooled doublecrystal Si (111) monochromator. The end-station was equipped with three

ionization chambers and Lytle/SDD detector after the focusing position of KB mirror for transmission and fluorescence mode X-ray absorption spectroscopy. The spectra were analyzed using an analysis program.<sup>[21]</sup>

Electrochemical Measurements: 5 mg of PdMo NWs@SWCNTs power and 5 mg Ketjen carbon were added into 2000  $\mu$ l mixed liquor which contained 1400  $\mu$ l water, 500  $\mu$ l ethanol, and 100  $\mu$ l 5wt% Nafion solution, then sonicated for 2 h in ice water to form homogeneous catalyst ink. This homogeneous ink (5  $\mu$ l) was coated on RRDE electrode and stood for overnight for the following tests. Commercial Pt/C (10 wt%) and Pd/C (10 wt%) were used as contrast samples.

The electrochemical property tests were conducted by CHI 700E workstation. A standard three-electrode system to measure the performance of ORR activity of different catalysts in 0.1M KOH electrolyte was used. Before tests, the electrolyte needed to be bubbled with  $O_2$  for 30 min. A Pt wire worked as counter electrode and Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl solution) worked as a reference electrode. Catalyst coated on RRDE controlled by Pine Instruments was worked as a working electrode. As-prepared catalyst ink (5  $\mu$ l) was deposited on the glassy carbon electrode, yielding a precious metal loading of around 1.28  $\mu$ g. The metal loading for commercial Pd/C and Pt/C was controlled to be around 3  $\mu$ g. The metal loading amount is about 0.13 ug when testing the mass activity for all the samples.

CV curves were recorded at 50 mV s<sup>-1</sup> in O<sub>2</sub>-saturated alkaline electrolyte at room temperature. LSV curves were recorded with a sweep rate of 10 mV s<sup>-1</sup> and a rotation speed of 1600 rpm, and the ring electrode potential was set as 1.4 V. The ORR curves were all iR-corrected. The ECSAs of various catalysts were determined though charges associated with H<sub>upd</sub> and Cu<sub>upd</sub> and the Pd surface oxide reduction. The desorption peaks of H<sub>upd</sub> from recorded CVs were used to calculate the ECSAs,<sup>[22]</sup> assuming a charge density of 210  $\mu$ C cm<sup>-2</sup>. For the Cu<sub>upd</sub> experiments, a N<sub>2</sub>-saturated solution containing 1 mM CuSO<sub>4</sub> and 0.5 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> was used as the electrolyte. The potential was first held at 0.3 V versus RHE for 100 s to form a Cu<sub>und</sub> monolayer, [23] and then CVs were conducted at 20 mV s<sup>-1</sup>. The ECSAs were calculated by subtracting the background CVs that were measured in N<sub>2</sub>-saturated 0.5 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> at 20 mV s<sup>-1</sup>, assuming a charge density of 470  $\mu$ C cm<sup>-2</sup>. For Pd surface oxide reduction, [24] the CVs of various catalysts were recorded in  $N_2$ -saturated 0.5 M  $H_2SO_4$  at 50 mV  $s^{-1}$ . The oxide reduction peak was used to calculate the ECSAs, assuming a charge density of 420  $\mu$ C cm<sup>-2</sup>. The test potentials were all referred to reverse hydrogen electrode (RHE) with the equation as follows: E(RHE) = E(versus Ag/AgCl) + 0.204 V + 0.0591 VpH. The electrolyte needs to be used right after it was ready and to be replaced every 10 hours.

The electron transfer number was calculated with the equation as follows:

$$n = \frac{4I_d}{I_d + I_r / N} (N = 0.37) \tag{1}$$

where the  $I_d$ ,  $I_n$ , N are the disk current, ring current, and the collection efficiency of the Pt ring, respectively.

Also, the n can also be estimated via K–L equation:

$$\frac{1}{j} = \frac{1}{j_L} + \frac{1}{B_V^2/\omega}, B = 0.62nFC_0 D_0^{\frac{2}{3}} V^{-\frac{1}{6}}$$
 (2)

where j is the measured current density.  $j_L$  is the limiting current density.  $\omega$  is the angular velocity of the working electrode. n is the electron transfer number. Faraday constant F=96485 C mol<sup>-1</sup>. Bulk concentration of O<sub>2</sub>  $C_0=1.2\times 10^{-6}$  mol cm<sup>-3</sup>. The diffusion coefficient of O<sub>2</sub>  $(D_O)$  is  $1.9\times 10^{-5}$  cm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>. Kinematic viscosity (V) is 0.01 cm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>.

The H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> yield can be determined by the following equation:

$$H_2O_2(\%) = 200 * \frac{\frac{l_r}{N}}{l_d + \frac{l_r}{N}} (N = 0.37)$$
 (3)

where the  $I_d$ ,  $I_n$ , N are the disk current, ring current, and the collection efficiency of the Pt ring, respectively.

Li-O2 Battery Test: The as-prepared PdMo NWs@SWCNTs cathode was assembled into a CR2032-type cell with a piece of Li sheet and the Whatman GF/D membrane. First, carbon cloth (1 cm in diameter) was immersed into ethyl alcohol and H<sub>2</sub>O in an ultrasonic cleaner for 10 min respectively to remove the impurities. Then, a mixture slurry including 80 wt% PdMo NWs@SWCNTs, 10 wt% Super P, and 10 wt% PVDF was dropped on the carbon cloth. Finally, the cathode was obtained after being dried in a vacuum oven for 10 h for further assembly and testing. 1 M LiTFSI/TEGDME was served as electrolyte. All the batteries were assembled in an Ar filled glove box  $(O_2/H_2O < 0.1 \text{ ppm})$ . Galvanostatic charge-discharge tests were all conducted on a CT2001Atype Land Battery Tester (Wuhan Land Electronic Co., Ltd) with a fixed voltage between 2.0 and 4.5 V (versus Li<sup>+</sup>/Li). The calculations of specific capacity were based on the total masses on carbon cloth. An electrochemical workstation (CHI660E, Shanghai Chenhua Instrument Co., Ltd) was used to perform the CV (0.5 mV s<sup>-1</sup>, 2-4.5 V) and EIS  $(10^{-2} \text{ Hz to } 10^5 \text{ Hz})$  measurements.

Computational Methods: The projector augmented wave formalism of density functional theory calculations was performed via Vienna ab-initio Simulation Package (VASP). Generalized gradient approximation (GGA) in the form of Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) was chosen as the exchange-correlation functional. The Pd (111), Mo (111), and PdMo (111) surfaces containing four atomic layers in thickness with a  $4\times4$  supercell were chosen to construct the slab models. A vacuum layer of 20 Å was introduced along the z-axis to avoid the artificial interactions between periodic images. The kinetic energy cutoff was set as 550 eV and k-points sampled using  $5\times5\times1$  Monkhorst-Pack mesh grid was used for geometry optimization. The convergence tolerance for residual force and energy were set to 0.01 eV Å $^{-1}$  and  $10^{-5}$  eV on each atom. The Bader charge was calculated via the method developed by Henkelman et al.  $^{[25]}$  which was suggested as an intuitive way of dividing molecules into atoms called the quantum theory of atoms in molecules.

In the present study, the theoretically well-defined free energy diagram (FED) approach was proposed by Norskov et al. [19c] was adopted. In the case of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), the overall reaction mechanism for the four-electron transfer processes involving several oxygen-containing intermediates (including OOH\*, OH\*, and O\*) was considered, and the reaction free energy  $\Delta G_{\rm H}$  was given as the difference between the initial and final states:

$$\Delta G_{\mathsf{H}} = \Delta E_{\mathsf{H}} + \Delta E_{\mathsf{ZPE}} + \mathsf{T} \Delta \mathsf{S} \tag{4}$$

where  $\Delta E_{\rm H}$  corresponds to the reaction energy obtained from DFT calculations, and  $\Delta E_{ZPE}$  represents the zero point energy. T is the temperature (298 K) and  $\Delta S$  is the entropy.

To explore the in-depth electronic origin, the p-band center level (b) was calculated according to the classical p-band models, in which b is defined as:

$$b = \frac{\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} E \times D(E) dE}{\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} D(E) dE}$$
 (5)

The model identifies the position of the orbital center and D(E) is the density of states distribution.

Oxygen adsorption energy ( $E_{ad}$ ) is defined as

$$E_{ad} = E_{\text{surf}+O_3} - E_{\text{surf}} - E_{O_3} \tag{6}$$

In which  $E_{\mathrm{surf}+O_2}$  and  $E_{\mathrm{surf}}$  are the total energies of the surface with and without the adsorbate, respectively. And  $E_{O_2}$  represents the total energy of an oxygen molecule.

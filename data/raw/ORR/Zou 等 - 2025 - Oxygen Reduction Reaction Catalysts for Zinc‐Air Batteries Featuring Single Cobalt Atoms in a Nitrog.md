**Single-atom catalysts (SACs) with high activity and efficient atom utilization for oxygen reduction reactions (ORRs) are imperative for rechargeable Zinc-air batteries (ZABs). However, it is still a prominent challenge to construct a noble-metal-free SAC with low cost but high efficiency. Herein, a novel nitrogen-doped graphene (NrGO) based SAC, immobilized with atomically dispersed single cobalt (Co) atoms (Co-NrGO-SAC), is reported for ORRs. In this 3D NrGO, the Co-N4 sites endow high-efficiency ORR activity, and the 3D-interconnected porous architectures of NrGOs guarantee numberous active sites accessibility. Compared to commercial Pt/C catalyst (≈5.8 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2), as-prepared Co-NrGO-SACs presents considerable limiting current density of ≈5.9 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2, prominent half-wave potential of ≈0.84 V, onset potential of ≈1.05 V, and as well as superior methanol resistance. Particularly, ZABs with Co-NrGO-SACs deliver remarkable power density (≈240 mW cm<sup>−</sup>2), super durability of over 233 h at 5 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2, outperforming noble-metal-based benchmarks. This work provides an effective noble-metal free carbon-based SAC nano-engineering for superdurable ZABs.**

**1. Introduction**

With increasing environmental pollution and global energy shortage, more sustainable power supplies and energy storage systems are imperatively desired.[\[1–3\]](#page-9-0) Rechargeable metal-air batteries have demonstrated significant potential for clean and renewable energy technologies. Among multitudinous metal-air batteries, Zinc-air batteries (ZABs) have attracted tremendous recent attention due to their high theoretical specific energy density (≈1086 Wh kg<sup>−</sup>1), environmental friendliness, low cost and high safety.[\[4,5\]](#page-9-0) Nevertheless, air cathodes suffer sluggish reaction kinetics during the charging/discharging process, especially for oxygen reduction reactions (ORRs), which seriously restrains

their energy conversion efficiency and practical application of ZABs.[\[6,7\]](#page-9-0) Although expensive and scarce notable metals (i.e., Pt) have been used commercially as electrocatalysts for accelerating the C═O cleavage and formation process, durable and highly efficient notablemetal-free catalysts for ORRs are still urgently needed to be developed.[\[8–10\]](#page-9-0)

The remarkable novel catalysts for ORRs, including heteroatomic doped carbon nanomaterials,[\[11–13\]](#page-9-0) carbon-supported single-atom catalysts(SACs),[\[14–16\]](#page-9-0) show great potential to replace traditional Ptbased catalysts because of their low cost, abundant resources, adjustable electronic structure and high efficient catalytic activity.[\[17\]](#page-9-0) Specially, carbon-supported SACs possess high electrical conductivity and a well-controlled atomic structure, presenting fully utilized atomic active sites, maximum atomic utilization efficiency and outstanding activity.[\[18–20\]](#page-9-0) Particularly,

graphene-supported nano-catalysts possess obvious priorities due to their large specific surface area and easy access of the single metal sites, high electrical properties and thermal stability.[\[21,22\]](#page-9-0) Attributed to their poor anchoring ability of metal atoms onto pure graphene, nitrogen-doped graphene (NrGO) have been demonstrated to be an effective carrier of transition metal atoms, resulted in improved oxygen adsorption and peroxide decomposition for increasing electrocatalytic activity.[\[23,24\]](#page-9-0) On this basis, the transition metal (Fe, Co, Ni, Mn, etc.) is apt to form a metal-nitrogen-carbon (M─N─C) bond.[\[25\]](#page-9-0) During ORRs, OH\* and additional O\*are firmly attached to the active metal site, thus promoting the performance of the catalyst.[\[26\]](#page-10-0) Dai et al. prepared a Co3O4 nanocrystals-based reduced graphene oxide (rGO) catalyst, delivering the increased ORR in an alkaline solution.[\[27\]](#page-10-0) Zhang et al. designed a series of transition metal single atoms anchored on a honeycomb N-doped carbon matrix with the help of NaCl template, demonstrated the reduced size of metal particles benefit to improve the reactivity of supported metal catalysts,[\[28–30\]](#page-10-0) and as well as their catalytic activity.[\[31–35\]](#page-10-0) High temperature pyrolysis is also the most common strategy for anchoring transition metal single atoms to the surface of carbonbased materials.[\[36,37\]](#page-10-0) Unfortunately, the strong – interactions generally make 2D grapheme sheets to be re-stacked in the

thermal treatment and catalytic reaction processes,[\[38\]](#page-10-0) which results in the rapid decrease for catalytic activity.

Notably, high accessibility of the atomic metal active sites and fast charge transfer are necessary for high-rate ZABs, which may be realized by designing a catalyst with 3D porous nanoarchitecture. It has been reported that 3D porous carbon materials can further improve the catalytic performance because they have large surface area to expose a large number of active sites, interconnected porous channels to facilitate mass and charge transfer, excellent electrical conductivity, and interconnected stable skeleton structure to provide abundant sites to anchor single metal atoms.[\[39,40\]](#page-10-0) Therefore, rational design and optimization of 3D porous carbon structures are also very important to promote the mass transfer process and increase the density of active sites.[\[41\]](#page-10-0) At present, there are two main methods for preparing 3D porous carbon. One is to prepare metal organic frameworks (MOFs). Imidazole organic frameworks (ZIFs) are the typical MOFs material, such as ZIF-8 combined with other active ZIFs in different forms to prepare 3D porous carbon-supported single atom catalysts with different structures.[\[16,42\]](#page-9-0) Another approach is to use different template strategies. For example, using SiO2 and polystyrene spheres (PSs) as templates, organic precursors containing carbon are polymerized or coated on the surface of the template, and metal salts are added to prepare 3D porous carbon supported single atom catalysts after heat treatment.[\[43,44\]](#page-10-0) In the single atom catalysts prepared by the above two methods, a number of single metal atoms are buried inside the interior of the carbon layers, which hinders the complete exposure of catalytic active sites. In the 3D porous graphene-based SAC, the catalytic active sites can be fully exposed leading to a larger electric field enhancement and thus accelerate the ORR kinetics. Besides, many studies have demonstrated Co-SACs deliver outstanding catalytic activity for ORRs, verifying an ideal ORR electrocatalysis for ZABs. In this context, incorporation of 3D porous graphene with rational single atoms is crucial for the development of highperformance ZABs.

Here, we propose a synthetic strategy for the production of high-efficiency NrGO-based SACs (Co-NrGO-SACs) comprised of single-atomic Co electroactive sites by a facile synthesis method. The catalyst architecture contains atomically dispersed single Co atoms encapsulated by 3D-interconnected porous NrGO frame works through accessible Co-N4 sites. Specifically, 3D NrGO framework with increased specific surface area (≈308m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>−</sup>1) endows high-density active sites to loading singleatomic Co particles, which help to improve the catalytic activity for ORRs. In addition, the N-doped graphene matrix cannot only immobilize Co-N4/C sites firmly on the 3D NrGO, but also modulate the electronic structure of Co-N4/C sites by longrange interactions, highly guaranteeing expected stability and oxygen electrocatalytic activities. More importantly, the many interconnected pores formed in the 3D frame create a rich set of mass transfer channels, leading to rapid mass transfer and diffusion kinetics. As-prepared Co-NrGO-SACs presents considerable limiting current density of ≈5.9 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2, prominent halfwave potential of ≈0.84 V, onset potential of ≈1.05 V, and as well as superior methanol resistance. As expected, as-assembled aqueous ZABs with the rationally designed Co-NrGO-SACs deliver significant power density and superior durability. This work provides a feasible avenue for the practical design of notablemetal-free high-efficiency SACs for ORRs in high-performance ZABs.

#### **2. Results and Discussion**

#### **2.1. Material Synthesis and Characterization**

The synthesis process of Co-NrGO-SACs with 3D-interconnected porous architecture is schematically illustrated in **Figure [1](#page-2-0)**a (see methods for details). As-prepared PS nanospheres possessed of smooth surface with the diameter of ≈320 nm in Figure S1a (Supporting Information). After that, a certain amount of polydiallyldimethylammonium chloride (PDDA) was introduced to regulate positive electricity on the surface of PS. Consequently, the GO with negative charge was then uniformly coated on PSs surface by electrostatic attraction shown in Figure S1b (Supporting Information). During heat treatment process, the decomposition of PSs contributed to the formation of 3D-interconnected holes graphene structure, which was composed of relatively uniform macropores and large pores (Figure [1b\)](#page-2-0). These continuous channels facilitated the rapid mass transfer improving the diffusion kinetics for catalytic processes.[\[45\]](#page-10-0) Meanwhile, the decomposed g-C3N4 supplied N-dopants. The doping of nitrogen plays two roles. First, it can be incorporated into the carbon planar skeleton of graphene, altering the adsorption state of oxygen molecules by carbon atoms surrounding the doped nitrogen atom, thereby improving its catalytic activity. Second, doped nitrogen atoms can combine with Co atoms to form catalytic active sites of CoN4, as demonstrated in XANES and EXAFS analyses. It is important to note that 3D rGO anchored the Co single atoms, while also increasing the electronic conductivity of the catalyst and forming catalytic active sites. In sharp comparison, graphene without PSs template presented as large chunks (Figure S1c, Supporting Information). Moreover, 3D-interconnected holes rGO had a larger specific surface area (from 203.4 to 291.7 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> in Table S1, Supporting Information), providing higher density reaction sites for catalytic activities. The product was mixed with Co (NO3)2•6H2O and pyrolyzed at 900 °C under argon atmosphere, resulting in atomically dispersed single Co atoms embedded in the 3D NrGO framework. Notably, the 3D structure of the catalyst began to collapse in large numbers with the increase of temperature, where the Co-NrGO-SAC-1000 catalyst basically showed a folded 2D structure (Figure S1d–f, Supporting Information). Therefore, the optimized heat temperature was set to 900 °C.

The morphology and nanostructure of the synthesized Co-NrGO-SACs were further investigated by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). As depicted in Figure [1c,](#page-2-0) the morphology clearly proved the 3D feature with spherical interconnected holes and quite thin layer, which was conducive to enhance the conductivity of the catalyst and accelerate the transfer of electrolytes in catalysts. No obvious Co nanoparticles were found in the HRTEM image in Figure [1c.](#page-2-0) It was speculated that Co may exist in the form of atoms. From the mapping images of each element, the C, N, and Co elements were uniformly distributed in the catalyst (Figure [1d\)](#page-2-0), indicating that N and Co were successfully incorporated into 3D rGO. The catalyst was further analyzed by aberration-corrected high angle annular dark field STEM (HAADF-STEM), as shown in Figure [1e.](#page-2-0) Due to the high electron density of metal atoms relative to C and

Isolated Co atoms are highlighted in red circles.

N atoms, many bright spots could be distinguished on the surface of the carrier and identified as Co atoms. It was found that the atomic configurations of Co in the Co-NrGO-SACs catalyst and no nanocrystals were atomically dispersed on the interconnected porous graphene matrix (highlighted in red circles), showing the high-temperature pyrolysis would not induce Co aggregation from atoms to nanocrystals and maintain high stability in isolated Co atoms, probably due to high electron density of metal atoms relative to C and N atoms, resulted in the intense confinement and the covalent coordination effects of 3D NrGO framework.[\[46\]](#page-10-0) At the same time, some bright spots with densely distributed atoms were also discovered, which are Co atomic clusters and did not form cobalt crystals. This can be confirmed in the XRD analysis.

The phase structure of rGO, N-rGO, and Co-NrGO-SACs catalysts were analyzed by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) test, as displayed in **Figure 2**[a.](#page-3-0) The two broad diffraction peaks appeared at 26.2° and 43.0°, assigning to the (002) and (100) crystal planes of graphitic carbon, respectively. Compared with the rGO catalyst, the left-shifted diffraction peaks of N-rGO and Co-NrGO-SACs

were due to the slightly larger size of the N atom than that of the C atom, resulting in the increased interlayer distance and the improved transport dynamics of the reactive substance between layers.[\[47\]](#page-10-0) The XRD patterns of catalysts with different amounts of N and Co elements were shown in Figure S2a,b (Supporting Information). The peak positions and shapes of catalysts with different amounts of N and Co elements were almost similar without any impurities. It was noteworthy that the absent diffraction peak corresponding to metallic Co in all catalysts with Co, further demonstrated Co did not exist in the form of nanoparticles or aggregates,[\[48\]](#page-10-0) consistent with the results of HAADF-STEM. These results confirmed that Co species existed in the form of atomic states. The similar XRD patterns of Co-NrGO-SACs at different heat treatment temperatures demonstrated the little effect of temperature had on the phase structure of the catalyst (Figure S2c, Supporting Information).

Raman spectroscopy was performed to analyze the effect of Ndopants and Co single atoms on degree of defects and disorder of the catalyst in Figure 2b. The peak D at ≈1358 cm<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> represented randomly arranged atoms, while the peak G at ≈1580 cm<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> assigned to sp<sup>2</sup> hybridized carbon atoms.[\[49\]](#page-10-0) Generally, the intensity ratio of D to G peak (*R* = *I*D/*I*G) can be used to characterize the defect degree and disorder degree of graphene materials. The larger ratio represented a higher disorder degree or more defects for materials.[\[50\]](#page-10-0) As depicted in Figure 2b, the increased *R* from ≈0.96 to ≈1.04 after addition of Co demonstrated the archors of single-atom Co sites could increase the density of defects in graphene matrix, benefiting to strengthen the catalytic activity of ORR.[\[51\]](#page-10-0) The Raman spectrums of catalysts with different amounts of nitrogen and cobalt were shown in Figure S3a,b (Supporting Information). As the amount of the two elements added changed, the R value also changed accordingly. The effect of heating temperature on the structural of Co-NrGO-SACs was also explored, as shown in Figure S3c (Supporting Information). As the temperature increases, the R value decreases, indicating a reduction in the number of defects. It probably dues to the decreased oxygen-containing functional groups, or the continuously repaired defects on the carbon plane and the collapsed/restack structure.

The specific surface area and pore size distribution of different catalysts were characterized by N2 adsorption and desorption isotherms Figure 2c,d and Table S1 (Supporting Information). The distinct hysteresis loops of type-IV suggested that the coexisting of the micropores and mesopores in 3D rGO frameworks. Based on the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) analysis, the specific surface area of Co-NrGO-SACs was ≈308.5 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>−</sup>1, larger than rGO with PSs (291.7 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>−</sup>1), rGO without PSs (203.4 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>−</sup>1), and NrGO (277.8 m2 g<sup>−</sup>1) (Table S1, Supporting Information). The N2 absorption and desorption curves of Co-NrGO-SACs with different amounts of nitrogen, cobalt and different heat treatment temperatures were shown in Figure S4 (Supporting Information). The proportion of mesopores between 3 and 4 nm, which contribute significantly to the high surface area in N-rGO, was significantly reduced. This may be due to the dopant of N atoms into the lattice of C atoms, resulted in some vacancies filled,[\[52\]](#page-10-0) consistent with the Raman results. The proportion of mesopores and macropores in NrGO increased between 20 and 50 nm with the increase of nitrogen content (Figure 2d).

Consequently, such 3D-interconnected mesopore-macropore structure in Co-NrGO-SACs with high specific surface area could accelerate mass transfer, create more catalyst anchor sites, and enlarge the contact area between the catalyst, electrolyte and oxygen for superior performance.[\[53\]](#page-10-0)

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was employed to identify the surface chemistry, bonding configuration and the loading level of N-dopants of Co-NrGO-SACs. The XPS full spectra revealed Co and N elements were successfully recombined into the Co-NrGO-SACs catalyst (Figure S5, Supporting Information). As depicted in **Figure 3**a, the deconvoluted C 1s spectrum displayed four characteristic peaks, corresponding to C─O (≈288.9 eV), C─N (≈286.6 eV), C═C (≈284.8 eV), and C─C (≈285.3 eV), respectively. Particularly, the signature of C─N confirmed that the establishment of N element into 3D rGO skeleton.[\[54\]](#page-10-0) Moreover, the deconvoluted N 1s spectrum (Figure 3b) of Co-NrGO-SACs revealed four types of dopant species, including pyridine-N (≈398.7 eV, 34.22 at. %), graphitized-N (≈402.6 eV, 19.27 at. %), pyrrolic-N (≈401.1 eV, 37.94 at. %), and oxidized-N (≈406.4 eV, 8.58 at. %). As we all known, N-dopants are apt to promote oxygen adsorption and reduction dynamics on rGO surface by modulating the electronic configuration. Expectedly, the pyridine-N and graphitized-N played by directly bind with single Co atoms to boost ORR performance.[\[23\]](#page-9-0) In particular, the active site of pyridine-N endowed the ORR going through a four-electron process. The N of graphite-N bonded with three C atoms, and then the remaining electrons could essentially split the O─O bond, strengthening the limiting current density and reducing the overpotential,[\[55\]](#page-10-0) finally improving the catalytic efficiency. In short summary, the populated pyridine-N and pyrrolic-N in Co-NrGO-SACs catalyst could not only highly enhance the ORR activity but also act as anchoring points for single Co atoms, and the pyridine-N promotes the half wave potential for ORR. For highresolution Co 2p energy spectrum (Figure 3c), the coexistence of Co 2p1/2 (≈796.8 eV) and Co 2p3/2 (≈780.6 eV) also suggested the presence of atomic Co sites. Notably, the intensity of Co 2p3/2 was higher than that of Co<sup>0</sup> (778.8 eV) and lower than that of Co2<sup>+</sup> (780.9 eV), indicating the existence of Co<sup>+</sup>(0*<<*2) in Co-N coordination.[\[56,57\]](#page-10-0) The Co-N at 784.5 eV component is found in Figure 3c, demonstrating the existence of the CoNx species in Co-NrGO-SACs. Combined with the results of HAADF-STEM and XRD, the majority of single Co atoms should directly bind with

either pyridine-N or pyrrolic- N sites in Co-NrGO-SACs catalyst. Generally, SACs possessed higher activity and lower side reaction than nano catalysts, which laid a solid foundation for the excellent electrochemical performance of subsequent catalysts.[\[58\]](#page-10-0) Specifically, the pyridine-N species produced in 3D NrGO frameworks could interact with the *d* orbital of metal component (Co) due to the existence of orbital lone pair electrons, where it was likely to form Co-N-C active sites. These active sites between single atom Co and NrGO contributed to the formation/deposition rate of O\* and OOH\* intermediates in ORRs.[\[59\]](#page-10-0) Consequently, the enhanced charge transfer power and accelerated electron transfer inevitably promoted the adsorption and diffusion of oxygen in ORR.[\[60,61\]](#page-10-0) The accurate mass loadings of Co species in the electrocatalysts were determined using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES), and the results are presented in Figure S6 (Supporting Information). The amount of Co species in Co-NrGO-SACs-1.5, Co-NrGO-SACs-2.0, and Co-NrGO-SACs-2.5 are 2.23, 2.48, and 2.49 wt%, respectively.

X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectra were performed to decode the precise local coordination environments and electronic structures of Co-NrGO-SACs, which played a crucial role for ORR activity. The Co K-edge of absorption near-edge structure (XANES) was displayed in Figure [3d.](#page-4-0) The Co K-edge absorption position of Co-NrGO-SACs was located between Co foil and CoO, suggesting that the oxidation state of Co was between 0 and +2,[\[62\]](#page-10-0) well consistent with the results of XPS. The Fourier Transform Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EX-AFS) of Co-NrGO-SACs further confirmed the difference in local coordination geometry. As shown in Figure [3e,](#page-4-0) the typical peak of Co-N coordination ≈1.4 Å was assigned to CoN4 with the absence of Co─O bonds at 1.7 Å and Co─Co bonds at 2.6 Å, confirming that the presence of Co species with the form of Co-N states in Co-NrGO-SACs.[\[63\]](#page-10-0) The EXAFS fitting curves (Figure [3f\)](#page-4-0) and fitting parameters (Table S2, Supporting Information) further confirmed single atom Co was coordinated with four N atoms as Co-N4 structure by quantitative chemical compositions of Co and N atoms. The wavelet transform (WT) analysis of Co K-edge EXAFS was conducted to detect high-resolution atomic configurations. The WT contour plots of Co-NrGO-SACs displayed one intensity maximum peak at ≈4 Å<sup>−</sup>1(Figure [3g\)](#page-4-0), associated with Co─N bonding compared with Co─Co (7.2 Å<sup>−</sup>1) in Co foil and Co─Co (6.3Å<sup>−</sup>1) in CoO, respectively, reflecting the presence of single Co atom sites. Based on the above evidence, the successful formation of affluent Co SA sates stabilized with N-dopants through Co─N4 bonds could be well proved in our catalyst.

#### **2.2. Electrocatalytic Performance of the Catalysts on ORR**

All characterization results indicate that Co-NrGO-SACs catalyst is a N-doped graphene with a 3D-interconnected porous structure, and abundant single atom Co is atomically dispersed on the 3D framework. It is expected to endow high-efficiency ORR catalyst effects for ZABs. The electrochemical tests of different catalysts were performed to evaluate the ORR activity based on rotating disk electrode (RDE) and rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE) with three-electrode system in O2-saturated 0.1 m KOH solution. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves (**Figure 4**[a\)](#page-6-0) displayed the critical cathodic peaks in the O2 saturated KOH solution. The more positive peak potential (≈0.82 V) with the larger peak current indicated the Co-NrGO-SACs catalyst may make the ORR easier to carry out. This probably was related to their large specific surface area and abundant catalyst active sites. The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves of N-rGO, Co-NrGO-SACs and commercial Pt/C catalysts were then compared at 1600 rpm, as shown in Figure [4b.](#page-6-0) The Co-NrGO-SACs catalyst surpassed the commercial Pt/C catalyst (5.8 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2, *E*onset = 1.02 V, *E*1/2 = 0.81 V) with a high limiting current density of 5.9 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2, a higher onset potential of 1.05 and half-wave potential of 0 .84V. Co-NrGO-SACs catalyst shows high ORR catalytic activity when comparing its E1/2 and current density with recently reported metal oxide catalysts for ORR (Table S3, Supporting Information). To further explore ORR kinetics, LSV curves were obtained with different rotation rates from 225 to 2000 rpm (Figure S7a, Supporting Information), and the corresponding Koutecky-Levich plots (Figure S7b, Supporting Information) were investigated. The diffusion limiting currents increased with the rotation speed, and the K-L plots show a linear relationship between current density and the increasing rotation speed. Consequently, the slopes of the K-L plots were similar at various potentials, and the calculated electron transfer number (n) was ≈3.95, close to the theoretical value of 4, confirming a noticeable four-electron reduction pathway from O2 to OH<sup>−</sup>. Rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE) was employed to confirm the transfer electron number of the ORRs. The currents of ring and disk were 5.8 and 745.5 μA (Figure S7b, Supporting Information) and the electron transfer number and H2O2 yield of the Co-NrGO-SACs catalyst through the electrochemical calculation were 3.96% and below 5%, respectively (Figure S7c, Supporting Information), well line in with the calculated electron transfer number according to K–L curves fitting. These calculated results further confirmed the ORR with Co-NrGO-SACs catalyst was dominated by four electron reaction mechanism,[\[64\]](#page-10-0) and exhibited a favorable ORR kinetic with outstanding selectivity.

The slope of Tafel curves of different catalysts were further compared to assess their ORR kinetics, as shown in Figure [4c.](#page-6-0) The Co-NrGO-SACs revealed a noticeably smallest Tafel slope of ≈65.3 mV dec<sup>−</sup>1, lower than that of Pt/C (69.5 mV dec<sup>−</sup>1) and NrGO (73.3 mV dec<sup>−</sup>1), verifying outstanding and faster ORR kinetics.[\[65–67\]](#page-10-0) This may be attributed to the high conductivity, high specific surface area, and interconnected pore structure of the catalyst, which makes it easier for more active sites to be exposed to the electrolyte solution, and the interconnected porous structure accelerates mass transfer during the reaction. The electrochemical test curves of Co-NrGO-SACs catalysts with different amounts of nitrogen, cobalt and different heat treatment temperatures were shown in Figure S9 (Supporting Information). It is notable that the introduction of Co atoms could greatly enhance the catalytic activity of catalytic materials, including the limiting current density, the initial potential and half wave potential (Table S4, Supporting Information). The limiting current density changes significantly with the change of heat treatment temperature, but the initial potential and half wave potential maintain stable (Figure S9g–i, Supporting Information), This was mainly because the heat treatment temperature changed the surface area of the catalyst material, thereby altering the number of active sites. Beside the Pt/C, the designed Co-NrGO-SACs also presented superior ORR performance when compared to NrGO catalyst with different N-dopant (Figure [4b;](#page-6-0) Figure S9, Supporting

Information). In addition, the optimized Co doping contents and heating temperature were 2.48 wt% (Figure S6, Supporting Information) and 900 °C, respectively, demonstrated in Figure S9d,e,h (Supporting Information) and S9g–i (Supporting Information). The intrinsic activity of the SACs can be confirmed by TOF.[\[68\]](#page-10-0) With the incorporation of Co, TOF attains a peak. And the TOF value is 0.43 e s<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup>·site<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> for Co-NrGO-SACs at 0.85 V (Table S4, Supporting Information), which exceeds that of Pt/C (0.005 e s<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> site<sup>−</sup>1) in Figure 4d. To sum up, as shown in Figure 4d, thanks to the optimal compositional/structural advantages of Co-NrGO-SACs, it has the most excellent ORR activity in the alkaline solution, surpassing most of the reported catalysts (Table S3, Supporting Information).

The long-term stability is an important index to evaluate the catalysts for ORRs. The stability of the Co-NrGO-SACs various catalysts was characterized using the *i*-*t* method and LSV curves before and after different CV cycles. After 10 000 s continuous discharge, the current retention rate of Co-NrGO-SACs catalyst was ≈90.7%, lager than that of commercial Pt/C catalyst (≈87.8%) in Figure 4e, demonstrated the superior stability of Co-NrGO-SACs. LSV curves of Co-NrGO-SACs catalyst were compared before and after 5000 and 10 000 CV cycles. As shown in Figure 4f, after 5000 and 10 000 cycles, the decrease in limit current density and the initial potential were very small, and the halfwave potential was only 4 and 32 mV negative shift, respectively. The Co-NrGO-SACs and commercial Pt/C catalysts were further evaluated by the methanol resistance. As shown in Figure S8a (Supporting Information), the current of the commercial Pt/C catalyst dropped sharply since adding methanol. In sharp comparison, the Co-NrGO-SACs catalyst basically remained stable. In short, the Co-NrGO-SACs catalyst not only had outstanding catalytic efficiency, but also endowed long-term super durability and methanol tolerance.

#### **2.3. Electrochemical Performance of Zinc-Air Batteries with Co-NrGO-SACs**

The ZABs with Co-NrGO-SACs/carbon paper as the air cathodes were assembled and compared to those assemble with Pt/C as the air cathode catalyst, where the ambient air acted as the cathode active agent, 6 m KOH and 0.2 m Zn(OAc)2 as electrolytes. The schematic diagram of the ZABs was shown in **Figure 5**[a.](#page-7-0) The open circuit voltage (*V*oc) of the Co-NrGO-SACs-based aqueous ZABs was 1.49 V, which lower than that of benchmark commercial Pt/C based ZABs (1.52 V), as depicted in Figure [5b.](#page-7-0) The polarization curves of the Co-NrGO-SACs and Pt/C catalysts and the corresponding power density curves were shown in the Figure [5c.](#page-7-0) Co-NrGO-SACs catalyst-based battery delivered higher power density of 240 mW cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> at 280 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> compared to that of commercial Pt/C (139 mW cm<sup>−</sup>2), indicated that the Co-NrGO-SACs excellent faster output energy during discharge and outperformed most reported ZABs (Table S5, Supporting Information). The multistep discharge curves of the Co-NrGO-SACs and commercial Pt/C catalysts under different current densities (1, 2, 5, 10, and 5 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2) were compared in Figure [5d.](#page-7-0) The discharge potential platforms remained highly stable at each current density for Co-NrGO-SACs catalyst. In addition, the discharge

potential of Co-NrGO-SACs decreased steadily and slowly with the increase of current density. In contrast, the discharge potential of commercial Pt/C exhibited an obvious downward trend. When the current density reaches 10 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2, the discharge potential of commercial Pt/C drops rapidly and unstable, meanwhile the potential of Co-NrGO-SACs catalyst reaches 1.32 V and the discharge potential loss of Co-NrGO-SACs catalyst is only 0.029 V, smaller than that of Pt/C (0.113 V) from 5 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> to 10 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2. In particularly, when the current density is set back to 5 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> from 10 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2, the discharge potential of Co-NrGO-SACs catalyst dropped by only 0.15%, smaller than that of Pt/C (1.6%), outperforming the better discharge stability for Co-NrGO-SACs than that of commercial Pt/C. The comparison of their charge and discharge curves was shown in Figure 5e. Co-NrGO-SACs catalyst-based battery maintained a smaller polarization voltage of (0.73 V) without obvious polarization than that of commercial Pt/C (1.06 V) at the same current density 50 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2, the charge and discharge voltage gap of Co-NrGO-SACs catalyst was smaller demonstrated a robust charging/discharging stability and less energy loss.[\[69\]](#page-10-0) More importantly, Co-NrGO-SACs catalyst-based battery possessed a longer-cycling lifespan can work continuously for 233 h, 7.1 times that of the commercial Pt/C (33 h) in Figure 5g. The charging-discharging potential gap at different times is shown in Figure 5f. The potential gap is very small, only 0.97 V, and it hardly changes over the charging-discharging cycle. Conclusively, the performance (e.g., max power density, and cycling stability) outperformed most of noble-metal SACs-based aqueous ZABs reported in the literature thus far (Figure S10 and Table S5, Supporting Information) which mainly originated from atomically dispersed Co-N4 sites with curved nanostructure and the 3D-interconnected porous structure of NrGO architecture. The reliable performance of Co-NrGO-SACs based ZAB was validated by glowing a light-emitting diode (LED) in Figure 5b, the realization of energy conversion and storage confirmed the Co-NrGO-SACs catalyst had a potential application prospect in ZABs.

#### **2.4. Catalytic Mechanism Analysis**

To further investigate the reason behind the enhanced ORR reactivity of the Co-NrGO-SACs catalyst, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the catalytic mechanism by combining literature review with our experimental results. The results of Raman, XPS, HAADF, XANES, EXAFS and WT- EXAFS suggested the defects (carbon vacancies), N atoms and Co-N4 center embedded in the graphene matrix were the activity sits to improving the catalytic activity of Co-NrGO-SACs catalyst. Literature[\[70–72\]](#page-10-0) indicates that the surrounding N atoms in the Co-N4 play a crucial role in inducing a higher filling degree of d-orbitals by transferring electrons and simultaneously decreasing the spin of the atomic Co center to hence optimizing binding strength with oxygen-containing intermediate species. The 4-electrons reduction pathway of O2 with Co-NrGO-SACs was confirmed by the ORR electron transfer number.

The ORR process is determined by the rate determining step (RDS), which corresponds to the lowest absolute value of the free energy change.[\[73\]](#page-10-0) The DFT calculation results of the catalytic materials in the literature[\[74,75\]](#page-10-0) indicate that the RDS energy barrier in CoSA-N-C is smaller than that in CoNP-N-C, and the overpotential of ORR process with CoSA-N-C is lower. The -spin orbitals of CoSA-N-C inclined toward the lower energy level. Compared to CoNP-N-C, the lower d-band center in CoSA-N-C led to an increase in the filling degree of the antibonding d orbitals, thereby weakening the interaction between active sites and the O-containing intermediates.[\[76,77\]](#page-10-0) These findings highlight the importance of the weak bond between the Co active center and the O-containing intermediates in promoting ORR kinetics, and reveal the activity origin in CoSA-N-C for ORR.

S. Zhou carried out the DFT-based theoretical calculations on conventional Fe-N4 and defective-edge Fe-N4 models.[\[78\]](#page-10-0) It can be observed that the electron density of the Fe center on the defective-edge Fe-N4 site is lower than that on the conventional Fe-N4 site, which weakens the adsorption of ORR intermediates on the defective Fe-N4 active site. This leads to an enhancement of the catalytic activity toward ORR and confirms that the edge defects of the active center are beneficial for improving the catalytic activity of the active center. By thoroughly considering the adsorption free energy effects of key intermediates like \*OOH, \*O, and OH\*, two catalytic models were meticulously constructed based on the graphene structure.[\[79\]](#page-10-0) The ORR proposed mechanisms on the Co-N4 and defective Co-N4 are shown in **Figure 6**a,b. The free energy of each elementary reaction of the above ORR process in two structure models were investigated with DFT calculations at 0 and 1.23 V displayed in Figure 6c,d. The RDS of the Co-N4 model is the fourth step with the least absolute value of free energy change ΔG4 revealing the limiting potential for ORR at 0 V, while the RDS of the defective Co-N4 model is the second step and ΔG4 for Co-N4 is 0.93 eV slightly smaller than ΔG2 for defective Co-N4 1.02 eV. The adsorption free energy during the ORR process in the two models exhibits a decreasing trend, which strongly suggests that the process is thermodynamically spontaneous. At U = 1.23 V, the RDS energy barrier for defective Co-N4 (0.21 eV) is smaller than that for Co-N4 (0.3 eV). These results further confirm that the defective Co-N4 has a better catalytic activity for ORR process compared with the Co-N4. The existence

<span id="page-9-0"></span>of defects changes the determining steps of the oxygen reduction reaction process and can greatly reduce the energy barrier of the reaction.

X. Zhou conducted DFT calculations on two models of cobalt atomic clusters and cobalt single atoms, and the results showed that the introduction of Co clusters leads to a relatively higher valence state in the active site of the Co single atoms and raises the d-band center energy of the single atom, altering the RDS of the reaction and directly increasing ORR catalytic activity.[\[80\]](#page-10-0) Based on the above analysis, many defects, cobalt clusters, and single atom Co-N4 active sites existed in the Co-NrGO-SACs can alter the RDS for ORR and enhance its intrinsic activity. At the same time, the presence of a large number of interconnected pores in Co-NrGO-SACs accelerates mass transfer promoting the kinetic rate of the reaction.

# **3. Conclusion**

A high efficiency oxygen reduction catalyst Co-NrGO-SACs was developed. It had a unique 3D porous structure and possessed many interconnected holes. Co single atoms were uniformly dispersed in 3D-interconnected porous nitrogen-doped graphene. The XAFS analysis highly confirmed the single atom Co-N4 to be the role active sites boosting ORR performance. The Co-NrGO-SACs catalyst displayed excellent electrochemical performance for ORR in alkaline medium. The catalytic activity, stability and methanol tolerance are better than that of Pt/C. The limiting current density of Co-NrGO-SACs catalyst was 5.9 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2, and the initial potential and half-wave potential were 1.05 and 0.84 V, respectively. Zinc-air battery with Co-NrGO-SACs possessed high power density and long-term cyclic stability, superior to that of commercial Pt/C catalyst. The power density of the ZABs was 240 mW cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> (commercial Pt/C 139 mW cm<sup>−</sup>2), and the continuous charge and discharge time can reach 233 h. The Co-N4 active sites formed by N doping in carbon materials can endow oxygen-containing intermediates with better adsorption energy and reduce the RDS energy barrier. And the introduction of defects is more conducive to reducing the reaction energy barrier. A large number of active sites and excellent material structure are necessary conditions to ensure that catalyst materials have excellent catalytic performance. This work is beneficial for guiding the development of efficient carbon supported metal SACs to be applied in renewable energy conversions.

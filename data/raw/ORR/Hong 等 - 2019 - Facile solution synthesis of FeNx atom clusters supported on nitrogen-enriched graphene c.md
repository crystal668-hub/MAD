The development of non-platinum catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) to substitute state-of-the-art but expensive Pt catalysts is essential for the development and practical application of fuel cells. Here, combining the self-assembly and coordination interaction between graphene oxide (GO) with g- $C_3N_4$  and iron phthalocyanine (FePc), FeN<sub>x</sub> atom clusters supported on three-dimensional porous nitrogen-enriched graphene carbon aerogels were successfully prepared by one facile solution method. The obtained FeN<sub>x</sub> atom cluster catalyst (FeN<sub>x</sub>-CN/g-GEL) exhibited superb catalytic performance ( $E_{1/2} = 0.90 \text{ V}$ ) toward the ORR, which is superior to that of commercial Pt/C ( $E_{1/2} = 0.835 \text{ V}$ ) and the currently reported non-noble nanocatalysts. Additionally, the catalyst displayed a high metal utilization rate with a mass specific activity of 840 mA mg<sub>Fe</sub><sup>-1</sup> at 0.80 V, excellent long-term stability with only a little decline after the 28 000 s test and remarkable tolerance to methanol and SCN<sup>-</sup>.

## 1. Introduction

As for energy conservation and ecological protection, fuel cells are the most promising power generation technology.1 The rapid development of fuel cells in large-scale application is mainly limited by the sluggish kinetics and high voltage processes of the cathodic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).<sup>2,3</sup> Currently, platinumbased electrocatalysts are the most commonly used ORR catalysts.4 However, the low abundance, prohibitive cost, and vulnerability to methanol crossover of Pt hamper the development of these sustainable energy devices.5 To solve these problems, alternative ORR electrocatalysts with lower cost, highreservation and excellent tolerance to methanol crossover are urgently needed.<sup>6,7</sup> Among the potential electrocatalysts, it has been widely researched and confirmed that Fe-N-C catalysts have a superior activity and higher selectivity towards the ORR compared with other non-noble metal catalysts and would be the most promising alternative to Pt catalysts. 8,9 As demonstrated by much research, the outstanding performance of Fe-N-C catalysts towards the ORR is mainly attributed to FeN<sub>x</sub> active sites. Excited by the extraordinary ORR catalytic performance, low price and abundant resources, numerous research studies for Fe-N-C catalyst materials have been focused on reasonable

activity toward the ORR. For instance, single atom Fe-N<sub>x</sub> catalysts with exceptional catalytic performances have attracted tremendous interest owing to the most exposed active sites and the maximum atom utilization efficiency. 10-14 Compared with single atom Fe-N<sub>x</sub> catalysts, FeN<sub>x</sub> atom clusters which are agglomerated from a number of Fe-N<sub>r</sub> atoms<sup>15,16</sup> have received less attention, although some nanoclusters, such as gold atom clusters 17 and platinum atom clusters,18 have long been reported to have good catalytic properties. It is well known that atom clusters which contain only a small number of atoms could exhibit peculiar and unexpected properties due to their high ratio of surface-to-bulk atoms, super atomic character different from bulk materials, low catalyst usage and effective catalyst utilization.19 Recently, H. Xue and T. He *et al.* prepared  $MN_x$  (M = Fe, Co) single clusters on N-doped porous carbon, and the obtained single Fe cluster catalyst (C/TP-Fe700) and CoN<sub>x</sub> single clusters on nanocarbon (C/ P/2Co600) exhibited superior or comparable catalytic performance towards the ORR to the corresponding large-sized nanoparticle catalysts and the commercial Pt-C catalysts in an alkaline medium.<sup>20-22</sup> These studies provide solid evidence that FeN<sub>x</sub> atom clusters could be a promising low-cost and high active ORR catalytic material. However, a clean and simple solution strategy with free surfactants for synthesizing stable FeN<sub>x</sub> atom clusters with narrow size distribution still remains a major challenge.

dimensional nanomaterial, has been widely used in electrocatalysis, sensing and energy storage due to its particular electronic conductivity and extremely high specific surface area, but its disadvantage of easy agglomeration cannot be ignored in practical application. On the other hand, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>) with sp<sup>2</sup> hybridized N is similar to the framework of graphene and has been proved to be effective in preventing the agglomeration of graphene by layer by layer self-assembly based on van der Waals interactions. What is more, the high level of pyridinic-N in g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> provides not only electron lone pairs to active  $\pi$  electrons of carbon in graphene materials to produce more edge-rich defects through sp<sup>2</sup> hybridization, T-29 but also abundant and more uniform nitrogen coordinators to capture metal ions in the ligands, which can facilitate the formation and stabilization of M-N<sub>7</sub> catalytically active sites.

Considering comprehensively, combining the self-assembly and coordination interaction between the mononuclear metal precursor iron phthalocyanine (FePc) and similar aromatic macrocyclic compounds carbon nitride (g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>) and graphene oxide (GO), we herein elaborately designed a facile and clean solution method to realize the successful loading of small-sized FeN<sub>x</sub> atom clusters on the surface of the nitrogen-enriched graphene carbon aerogel. This innovative design strategy solves several important problems in the preparation of  $FeN_x$  atom cluster catalysts. First, nitrogen-rich graphene as the substrate can avoid graphene from agglomeration and also strengthen the stability of atom clusters by the strong coordination interaction between nitrogen and metal atoms. Second, FePc (porphyrin-like structure) is conducive to control particle size and prevent aggregation of ions through forming FeN<sub>x</sub> single active sites at high temperature;30 hence, hydrothermal synthesis of carbon aerogels with FePc as the Fe resource and nitrogen-enriched graphene as the substrate is an effective strategy to produce uniform and stable  $FeN_x$  atom clusters. To the end, the small-size atom clusters are uniformly supported on the nitrogen-enriched graphene through a facile and clean solution method without the addition of contaminating surfactants or poisonous dissolvent. The resultant FeN<sub>x</sub> atom cluster catalyst shows extraordinary catalytic activity and excellent stability toward the ORR in alkaline solution.

# 2. Experimental section

#### Regents

Iron(II) phthalocyanine (Aladdin, 98%), potassium permanganate (Changsha Antai Fine Chemical Experiment Co., Ltd, 99.5%), melamine (99.0%), potassium hydroxide (85%), hydrogen peroxide (30%), nitric acid (65–68%), hydrochloric acid (36–38%), and sulphuric acid (95–98%) were purchased from China Pharmaceutical Group Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Nafion solution (5 wt%) was obtained from Du Pont Corp, and Pt/C (20 wt% Pt) was purchased from Alfa Aesar. All chemicals were directly used without further purification.

#### Synthesis of g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>

g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> was prepared according to the literature.<sup>31</sup> 5 g of melamine was placed in a porcelain boat and pyrolyzed at 550 °C for

4 h in Ar. After cooling down, the resultant yellow powder denoted as g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> was collected.

#### Synthesis of GO

Graphene oxide nanosheets were prepared according to the literature.32 Typically, 3 g of graphite was slowly poured into the mixed solution containing 12 mL concentrated H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, 2.5 g  $K_2S_2O_8$  and 2.5 g  $P_2O_5$ , heated to 80 °C using an oil bath and then kept for 4.5 h. After cooling down, the above solution was diluted with 0.5 L of deionized water, filtered and washed with deionized water. Then, the product dried in air overnight was treated again in a mixed acidic solution of H2SO4 and H3PO4 with a volume ratio of 9:1 (120 mL) at 0 °C. After this, 15 g of KMnO<sub>4</sub> was slowly added to the above solution under stirring in an ice water bath, keeping the temperature below 20 °C, followed by stirring at 35 °C for another 2 h, and then diluted with 250 mL + 700 mL of deionized water within 15 min. Subsequently, 20 mL of 30% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was added into the above diluent, and the solution bubbles and turns bright yellow at the same time. Finally, GO was obtained by continuously washing with HCl solution (1 L), washing with sufficient water to neutral, centrifuging (11 000 rpm) and drying in an oven at 40 °C.

#### Synthesis of FeN<sub>x</sub>-CN/g-GEL

First, 60 mg of GO was added in 60 mL of ultrapure water to obtain a yellow GO dispersion. Then, for preparing FePc-gC<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>/ g-GEL, 30 mg of FePc and 120 mg of g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> were poured into the above GO dispersion, and the obtained suspension was stirred under ultrasonic agitation for 4 h until the color of solution changed from brownish yellow to pale green and finally turned to dark green. Next, the above suspension was transferred into a 100 mL high temperature reaction kettle, keeping at 160 °C for 24 h in an oven. After being freeze dried for 24 h, the asprepared FePc-gC<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>/g-GEL was pyrolysed at 650 °C for 2 h in Ar to obtain the final product FeNx-CN/g-GEL. In order to explore the optimum ratio of raw materials, several FeN<sub>x</sub>-CN/g-GEL samples with a series of mass ratios for GO: g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>: FePc (60:120:15,60:120:20,60:120:30,60:120:60,60:90:30 and 60:135:30) were evaluated. Among them, the final optimal ratio is determined to be 60:120:30.

For comparison, graphene aerogel (g-GEL), graphene and g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> composite aerogel (CN/g-GEL), and iron phthalocyanine and graphene aerogel (FeN<sub>x</sub>/g-GEL) were also prepared under the same conditions except for the different amounts of g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> and FePc. For g-GEL, only 60 mg of GO was added, for CN/g-GEL, 60 mg of GO and 120 mg of g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>, and for FeN<sub>x</sub>/g-GEL, 60 mg of GO and 30 mg of FePc, respectively.

#### **Materials characterization**

SEM images and EDS mapping analyses were collected on a Hitachi S-4800. TEM images were collected on a JEM-3010, Japan. High-angle annular dark-field scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM) and HAADF-STEM-EDS maps were acquired from TF20, Jeol 2100F. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was carried out using a X-ray diffractometer (D/MAX-RA diffractometer, Rigaku, Tokyo, Japan). XPS spectra were obtained on an ESCALAB 250Xi

spectrometer (Thermo Fisher-VG Scientific) with an Al-K $\alpha$  X-ray source. A Raman spectrometer was obtained from inVia-Reflex, England (532 nm excitation wavelength). An ASAP 2020M+C automatic micropore and chemisorption analyzer (Micromeritics, Norcross, USA) was used to determine BET surface area and pore size distribution.

#### **Electrochemical testing**

All electrochemical measurements were conducted on an Autolab PGSTAT12 in a standard three-electrode system. The reference electrode was the Ag/AgCl electrode (saturated KCl aqueous solution), the counter electrode was the graphite rod electrode, and a rotating disk glassy carbon electrode (GC, 5 mm) was used as the working electrode. For the electrochemical test in 0.1 M KOH, 3 mg catalysts are dispersed by sonication 1 h in 1 mL Nafion/isopropylalcohol (25  $\mu$ L + 975  $\mu$ L). Then 10  $\mu$ L catalyst ink was loaded on a glassy carbon electrode and dried. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves were tested in an Ar or O2saturated electrolyte, LSV polarizations were carried out in an O<sub>2</sub>-saturated electrolyte at the rotation speeds of 400, 625, 900, 1225, and 1600, and the chronoamperometric curves were recorded in the O2-saturated solution. In addition, for evaluating the methanol or SCN tolerance of catalysts, methanol (1 M) or SCN<sup>-</sup>(0.1 M) was added to the electrolyte during the chronoamperometric determination. In this work, all the measured potentials (vs. Ag/AgCl) were converted to the RHE scale:

$$E_{\text{RHE}} = E_{\text{Ag/Agcl}} + 0.198 + 0.591 \times \text{pH}$$
  
$$J^{-1} = J_{\text{L}}^{-1} + J_{\text{K}}^{-1} = (B\omega^{1/2})^{-1} + J_{\text{K}}^{-1}$$

$$B = 0.62nFC_{O_2}(D_{O_2})^{2/3}\nu^{-1/6}$$

where J is the measured current density,  $J_{\rm K}$  is the kinetic current density,  $J_{\rm L}$  is the diffusion-limiting current density,  $\omega$  is the electrode rotation rate, n is the electron transfer number, F is the Faraday constant ( $F=96~485~{\rm C~mol}^{-1}$ ),  $D_{\rm O_2}$  is the diffusion coefficient of O<sub>2</sub> ( $1.9\times10^{-5}~{\rm cm}^2~{\rm s}^{-1}$  for 0.1 M KOH solution), and  $C_{\rm O_2}$  is the bulk concentration of O<sub>2</sub> ( $1.2\times10^3~{\rm cm}^2~{\rm L}^{-1}$  for 0.1 M KOH solution).  $^{33,34}$ 

### 3. Results and discussion

The fabrication procedure for  $FeN_x$ -CN/g-GEL is shown in Scheme 1. First of all, a uniform mixed solution of iron phthalocyanine (FePc), GO nanosheets and g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> can be easily obtained under the action of ultrasound. Then, the above mixed solution formed FePc-gC<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>/g-GEL hydrogel after hydrothermal reaction in a high temperature reaction kettle. Finally, FeN<sub>x</sub> atom clusters were uniformly supported on the nitrogen-rich graphene to obtain the final carbon aerogel (FeN<sub>x</sub>-CN/g-GEL) by pyrolyzing the freeze-dried FePc-gC<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>/g-GEL.

The atom cluster features of  $\mathrm{FeN}_x$  in the as-prepared  $\mathrm{FeN}_x$ -CN/g-GEL can be identified upon the microscopic and spectroscopic characterization. The large-scale scanning SEM images of  $\mathrm{FeN}_x$ -CN/g-GEL are shown in Fig. 1a and b, displaying the individual two-dimensional nanosheet feature of graphene with more wrinkles on the surface and the typical 3D hierarchical porous morphologies of the resultant carbon material, which can be attributed to the homogeneous dispersion of graphene and maintaining the high surface area. From Fig. S1a and b,† GO showed a wide and lamellar nanosheet structure, while g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> presented a stripped patch. The hierarchical

porous feature of FeN<sub>x</sub>-CN/g-GEL was consistent with that of FePc-gC<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>/g-GEL (Fig. S2†), indicating that the material maintained the 3D porous morphology during pyrolysis at high temperature. The lamellar multiple-fold morphology of FeN<sub>x</sub>-CN/g-GEL is further revealed by the TEM image in Fig. 1c, and the high-resolution TEM images confirmed the existence of graphite and amorphous carbon without any evidence of particles (inset in Fig. 1c). However, the HAADF-STEM images of FeN<sub>x</sub>-CN/g-GEL in Fig. 1d show that a number of atoms aggregate into the atom clusters. <sup>13,15,16</sup> The elemental distribution of FeN<sub>x</sub>-CN/g-GEL was further distinguished by HAADF-STEM-EDS maps in Fig. 1f–i, revealing the uniform distribution of three major elements including C, Fe and N.

The crystalline characteristic of FeN<sub>x</sub>-CN/g-GEL was further detected by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), and the corresponding XRD pattern is shown in Fig. 2a. From Fig. 2a, two broad diffraction peaks at 25.6° and 43.1° assigned to the (002) and (101) planes of graphitic carbon<sup>35</sup> and no characteristic diffraction peak of metallic Fe or Fe-based compounds can be

observed, an indication that there is no any crystal particles of Fe or Fe-based compounds in  $\text{FeN}_x$ -CN/g-GEL. Combining with the analysis results of the previous XPS and HAADF-STEM, it can be further deduced that the  $\text{FeN}_x$  atom cluster is uniformly dispersed in  $\text{FeN}_x$ -CN/g-GEL.

The detail elemental species of  $FeN_x$ -CN/g-GEL were further analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. From the XPS survey spectrum (Fig. 2b), it is recognized that  $FeN_x$ -CN/g-GEL mainly consists of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and iron elements (O element may be due to the exposure of the sample to air), and the atomic ratios of C, N, O, and Fe are approximately 88.95, 5.18, 5.09 and 0.78 at%, respectively. Fig. 2C shows that the high-resolution Fe 2p spectrum comprised two major peaks at 711 eV ( $2p_{1/2}$ ) and 724 eV ( $2p_{3/2}$ ), along with two small satellites peaks,<sup>36</sup> and no characteristic peaks of Fe<sup>0</sup> metal or Fe–Fe bonds around 706 eV could be observed,<sup>37</sup> suggesting that Fe exists in the form of  $Fe^{2+}$  or  $Fe^{3+}$  and is anchored and stabilized in the sample by forming  $FeN_x$  species.<sup>22,32–34</sup> In addition, the N 1s high resolution spectrum of  $FeN_x$ -CN/g-GEL

(Fig. 2d) can be fitted into three peaks at 400.6 eV, 399.4 eV and 398.6 eV assigned to graphic N, pyrrolic N or Fe-N, and pyridinic N,38 respectively, and, compared with the low content of graphic N (19.4%), pyrrolic N and pyridinic N are the main peaks with the content of 28.9% and 51.7%, respectively. Notably, from the XPS analysis of CN/g-GEL (Fig. S3†), carbon, nitrogen and oxygen are the main elements with an atomic ratio of 93.3: 3.83: 2.87, and the graphic N and pyridinic N in FeN<sub>r</sub>-CN/g-GEL are richer than those in CN/g-GEL with 3.66% of graphic N and 49.74% pyridinic N, implying that FeN<sub>x</sub> species in FeN<sub>x</sub>-CN/g-GEL could help the incorporation of pyridinic N into graphene. It can be believed that the high content of graphic N and pyridinic N and the presence of FeN<sub>x</sub> would be attributed to the high electrical conductivity and the outstanding ORR catalytic activity.<sup>39-41</sup> The high-resolution C 1s spectrum of FeN<sub>x</sub>-CN/ g-GEL (Fig. 2e) shows four peaks at 284.8 eV, 285.6 eV, 287.8 eV, and 290.72 eV, belonging to C=N/C=O, C-O, C-N, and C=C, respectively. 42 Among them, the strongest peak of sp<sup>2</sup> C=C has been wildly accepted being beneficial for high electrical conductivity.43

The specific surface area and pore structure of FeN<sub>x</sub>-CN/g-GEL and the control sample FeN<sub>x</sub>/g-GEL were further clarified by measuring nitrogen sorption-desorption isotherms and pore-size distribution utilizing a ASAP 2020M+C analyzer, and the corresponding results are shown in Fig. S4.† In Fig. S4a,† the nitrogen sorption-desorption isotherms of FeN<sub>x</sub>-CN/g-GEL and FeN<sub>x</sub>/g-GEL present similar curves combining type I and IV isotherms with a sharp uptake at low relative pressure (inset in Fig. S4a†) and a clear hysteresis loop at a high relative pressure, proclaiming the hierarchical porous structure with micropores, mesopores and macropores. Notably, observed from the porosity distribution (Fig. S3b†) calculated from the N<sub>2</sub> adsorption using the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) model, FeN<sub>x</sub>-CN/g-GEL possesses a much higher proportion of mesopores than FeN<sub>x</sub>/g-GEL, which is favorable for exposure to more active sites and transportation of molecules and ions in electrolytes and molecules and ions in aqueous electrolyte to active sites. 44-46 More exposed active sites of FeNx-CN/g-GEL can be fully proven by its obviously higher BET specific surface area  $(1039.7 \text{ cm}^2 \text{ g}^{-1})$  than that of FeN<sub>x</sub>/g-GEL (352.9 cm<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>). The higher mesoporous proportion and specific surface area of FeN<sub>x</sub>-CN/g-GEL may be ascribed to the gas etching generated from the thermal decomposition of g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>.<sup>47</sup>

Raman spectroscopy for each sample shown in Fig. 3f exhibits two similar major bands at around 1320 cm $^{-1}$  and 1590 cm $^{-1}$ , attributed to the defective or disordered sp $^3$  hybridized carbon (D band) and the graphitic sp $^2$ -hybridized carbon (G band), respectively.  $^{48,49}$  The  $I_{\rm D}/I_{\rm G}$  intensity ratio of CN/g-GEL (1.06) is higher than that of g-GEL (0.94), and the  $I_{\rm D}/I_{\rm G}$  of FeN $_x$ /g-GEL (0.80) and FeN $_x$ -CN/g-GEL (0.82) is much lower than that of g-GEL and CN/g-GEL suggesting that the introduction of g-C $_3$ N $_4$  could availably increase the defect density of carbon materials, while FePc caused a decrease of the  $I_{\rm D}/I_{\rm G}$  ratio due to a part of defect sites covered by FeN $_x$  atom clusters.  $^{50}$ 

The ORR electrocatalytic performances of the as-prepared electrocatalysts were evaluated by CV and LSV in  $O_2$ -saturated 0.1 M KOH solutions. In Fig. 3a, compared with that in Ar-

saturated 0.1 M KOH solution, there is an obvious oxygen reduction peak in the CV diagram of FeNx-CN/g-GEL in O2saturated 0.1 M KOH, indicating a considerable catalytic activity of FeNx-CN/g-GEL for the ORR. By comparing LSV curves of different catalysts tested in O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH at a rotating rate of 1600 rpm (Fig. 3b), it can be observed that FeN<sub>x</sub>-CN/g-GEL achieved the best catalytic performance of all the tested catalysts.  $E_{\text{onset}}$  on FeN<sub>x</sub>-CN/g-GEL is observed to be 1.0 V, which is very close to that of the commercial Pt/C (1.04 V), and its half potential  $(E_{1/2})$  reached up to 0.90 V, 65 mV more positive than the commercial Pt/C catalyst.  $E_{1/2}$  of g-GEL and CN/g-GEL is 0.636 V and 0.756 V, respectively, obviously more negative than that of FeN<sub>x</sub>-CN/g-GEL. Compared with some previously reported non-noble metal ORR catalysts and even some single atomic catalysts, which are currently in the focus of attention (Table S1†), FeNx-CN/g-GEL also exhibits superior catalytic activity. Moreover, the mass activity of FeNx-CN/g-GEL reaches 840 mA mg<sub>Fe</sub><sup>-1</sup> at 0.80 V. These results indicated that the introduction of FePc played a significant role in improving the ORR catalytic activity. Besides, the catalytic activity of the  $\text{FeN}_x/\text{g-GEL}$  catalyst ( $E_{1/2} = 0.864 \text{ V}$ ) is inferior to that of  $\text{FeN}_x$ -CN/g-GEL, and  $E_{1/2}$  of g-GEL is obviously negative compared to that of CN/g-GEL, implying that the large numbers of defects induced by the nitrogen-doping carbon derived from g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> also had great influence on boosting the ORR catalytic activity of FeNx-CN/g-GEL.51

Fig. 3c shows the Tafel plots of FeN<sub>x</sub>-CN/g-GEL and all the contrast catalysts. Fig. 3c shows that the obtained Tafel slope for FeN<sub>x</sub>-CN/g-GEL is 14 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>, significantly lower than that of g-GEL (54 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>), CN/g-GEL (40 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>), Pt/C (40 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>), and FeN<sub>x</sub>/g-GEL (28 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>) as well. These results further confirmed the superior catalytic activity of FeN<sub>x</sub>-CN/g-GEL for the ORR compared with the contrast catalysts. Also, FeNx-CN/g-GEL exhibited enhanced activity for the ORR than the previously reported non-platinum catalysts in 0.1 M KOH solution (Table S1†). Fig. 3d presents the LSV curves of FeN<sub>x</sub>-CN/ g-GEL in O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH solution at various rotating speeds from 400 to 1600 rpm. Fig. 3d shows that similar Koutecky-Levich (K-L) plots with an excellent linearity at different voltages of 0.30 V, 0.40 V and 0.50 V can be obtained (Fig. 3e), and the calculated number of electrons transferred is equivalent to ~4.0, exhibiting a dominant four-electron transfer process in which O<sub>2</sub> is directly reduced to OH<sup>-</sup> in 0.1 M KOH.

The electrochemical active surface area (EASA) of all samples was tested according to the capacitances of the double-layer  $(C_{\rm dl})$  through a simple cyclic voltammetry (CV) method at different scan rates (Fig. 3f). In Fig. 3f, the capacitive currents ( $\Delta J$ ) at 0.15 V linearly increase with the scan rates, and the calculated  $C_{\rm dl}$  from the slope is 0.55 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>, 1.65 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>, 1.95 mF cm<sup>-2</sup> and 4 mF cm<sup>-2</sup> for g-GEL, CN/g-GEL, FeN<sub>x</sub>/g-GEL and FeN<sub>x</sub>-CN/g-GEL, respectively, indicating that FeN<sub>x</sub>-CN/g-GEL possesses the highest EASA value among the tested samples. Moreover, it is noted that  $C_{\rm dl}$  of CN/g-GEL is higher than that of g-GEL and FeN<sub>x</sub>/g-GEL, thus demonstrating that the introduction of g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> had brought about a great enhancement in defective sites and electrochemical active surface area of carbon materials.

The methanol tolerance of FeNx-CN/g-GEL is compared with that of the commercial Pt/C catalyst by chronoamperometric measurements in 0.1 M KOH solution with and without 1 M methanol. In Fig. 4a, when 1 M methanol was added into 0.1 M KOH, the current for Pt/C signicantly decayed (Fig. 4a), while, in contrast, the current response for FeNx-CN/g-GEL retained an almost invariant value. The above result showed the strong tolerance to methanol crossover of FeNx-CN/g-GEL. In addition,

as it is well-known that thiocyanide (SCN<sup>-</sup>) ions or cyanide ions (CN<sup>-</sup>) have a strong affinity to transition metals and even poison transition metals, 20,52 to investigate the SCN-resistance of FeNx-CN/g-GEL, the LSV curves in O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH with and without 0.1 M KSCN were also determined.

0.1 M KOH remained in an almost invariant state, illustrating that FeN<sub>x</sub> species in FeN<sub>x</sub>-CN/g-GEL were stable in the ORR process and had good tolerance to SCN-.

To evaluate the practicability of FeN<sub>x</sub>-CN/g-GEL, the longterm durability was tested by continuous chronoamperometrics of 28 000 s at 0.654 V at a scan rate of 1600 rpm in O<sub>2</sub>saturated solution. As shown in Fig. 4c, after 28 000 s of continuous operation, the FeNx-CN/g-GEL catalyst exhibited almost complete retention of the initial current density, which is obviously superior to that on Pt/C (80.1%). The result demonstrated the extraordinary durability of FeN<sub>x</sub>-CN/g-GEL in 0.1 M KOH. To further explore the catalytic activity of FeN<sub>x</sub>-CN/ g-GEL after the stability test, the LSV curves before and after the chronoamperometric test are presented in Fig. 4d. In Fig. 4d, after continuous operation for 28 000 s in 0.1 M KOH solution, the activity of FeN<sub>x</sub>-CN/g-GEL exhibited a minor deterioration with only 9 mV negative shift of  $E_{1/2}$ . Furthermore, the TEM images of FeN<sub>x</sub>-CN/g-GEL after the stability test in Fig. S5a and b† show that the catalyst still maintained the same lamellar folding structure after testing, and no obvious nanoparticles appeared in the HRTEM image (the inset in Fig. S5b†). The minor deterioration of catalytic activity and no evident changes of the morphology confirmed the excellent durability of FeN<sub>x</sub>-CN/g-GEL in 0.1 M KOH solution. On the basis of the above characterization and analysis on structure morphology, chemical composition and electrochemical performances, the outstanding ORR activity and excellent stability should be attributed to the following reasons: firstly, three-dimensional porous carbon aerogels with great surface area and high

proportion of mesopores are favorable for exposure to more active sites and transportation of O<sub>2</sub> molecules and related ions in electrolytes to active sites. Second, based on the self-assembly and coordination interaction between iron phthalocyanine (FePc), g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> and GO, the uniform-loaded FeN<sub>x</sub> atom clusters played a significant role in affording the superb ORR catalytic activity. Third, the introduction of g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> resulted in nitrogenenriched graphene carbon aerogels and caused a great enhancement in defective sites and electrochemical active surface area of the carbon material, thus producing a noticeably positive impact on the catalytic activity. Moreover, nitrogenenriched graphene derived from the composites of graphene and g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> also exhibited considerably catalytic activity towards the ORR.24 Last but not least, the resultant three-dimensional structure and abundant nitrogen content were responsible for uniformly anchoring FeN<sub>x</sub> atom cluster and endowing the catalyst with the excellent stability.

# Conclusions

In summary, well-dispersed  $FeN_x$  atom clusters were successfully anchored on nitrogen-enriched graphene carbon aerogels by a facile solution strategy. Based on the self-assembly and coordination interaction between graphene oxide (GO) g-C3N4 and iron phthalocyanine (FePc), the resulting catalyst (FeN<sub>x</sub>-CN/g-GEL) possesses a three-dimensional porous structure with great specific surface area and abundant doped nitrogen, which is in favour of exposure to more active sites and transportation of O2 molecules and related ions in electrolytes to active sites, thus playing a significant role in improving the ORR catalytic activity. Meanwhile, uniformly loaded FeNx atom clusters also exert a key role in the ORR catalytic process. Further electrochemical characterization demonstrated the superb ORR catalytic performances of FeN<sub>x</sub>-CN/g-GEL with a high mass activity (840 mA mg<sub>Fe</sub><sup>-1</sup>) and a positive half-wave potential (0.90 V), which is superior to the commercial Pt/C catalyst and the reported non-platinum catalysts. In addition, FeN<sub>x</sub>-CN/g-GEL also exhibits excellent long-term stability and strong tolerance to methanol crossover and SCN poisoning. This represents tremendous progress in the research of oxygen reduction catalysts, and the simple route for the carbon material supported  $FeN_x$  atom clusters developed in this work would be promising to rationally design atomic-scale catalysts with low-cost and a high metal utilization rate for various energy conversion and storage applications.

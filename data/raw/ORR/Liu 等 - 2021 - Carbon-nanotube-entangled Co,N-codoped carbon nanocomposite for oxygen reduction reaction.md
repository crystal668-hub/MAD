#### Abstract

The design of highly efficient and stable electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is still a great challenge. Herein, we prepared Co,N-codoped carbon nanocomposites (Co@NC-ZM) with entangled carbon nanotubes. The large Brunauer–Emmett–Teller surface area (604.7 m2 g−<sup>1</sup> ), rich mesoporous feature, Co,N doping and synergetic effect between various species of Co@NC-ZM can expose more active sites and facilitate conductivity and mass transport. Benefiting from the above unique advantages, Co@NC-ZM exhibits excellent ORR performance with more positive onset potential (0.96 V) and half-wave potential (0.83 V) than those of commercial Pt/C (0.96 and 0.81 V, correspondingly). This work provides a new strategy for further exploring efficient non-precious-metal-based catalysts for ORR.

### 1. Introduction

Considering environmental pollution and increasing energy demand, it is urgently required to explore efficient and environmentally friendly energy conversion and storage devices [[1](#page-8-0)–[5](#page-8-0)]. Proton exchange membrane fuel cells and metal–air cells are widely studied and considered as green energy conversion devices [[6](#page-8-0)–[8](#page-8-0)]. Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is one of the electrochemical reactions that determines the efficiency of metal–air batteries and fuel cells [[9](#page-8-0)–[11](#page-8-0)]. At present, the most effective ORR catalysts are Pt-based materials (such as Pt/C). However, the shortage of resources, poor methanol resistance and expensive price limit its widely commercial application [[12](#page-8-0)–[14](#page-8-0)]. Therefore, it is of great significance to find a cheap and earth-abundant electrocatalyst to replace Pt/C.

Metal organic frameworks are widely used in gas storage, drug transportation, energy storage and conversion equipment, owing to the characteristics of large specific surface area, high porosity and adjustable pore size [[15](#page-8-0)–[17](#page-8-0)]. As a typical example of metalorganic frameworks, zeolite imidazole frameworks (ZIFs) are crystalline materials formed by connecting transition metal ions and N-containing organic ligands through a certain continuity and periodicity. Thanks to their ultra-high surface area, abundant porosity and thermochemical stability, ZIFs are considered to be an ideal precursor for preparing N-doped carbon materials [[18](#page-8-0)–[21](#page-8-0)]. Pyrolysis of ZIFs can provide both C and N sources to form N-doped carbon materials [[20](#page-8-0)]. Recently, numerous attempts have been made to design carbon nanocomposites for ORR, such as carbon nanotube (CNT)/carbon nanoparticle (NP)

composite [22], CNT/graphene hybrid [23], carbon NP/carbon nanofiber composite [24, 25], and graphitic carbon/graphene [26]. However, it is a challenge to provide a simple synthesis method of carbon nanocomposites for electrocatalysis, supercapacitors and rechargeable batteries.

At present, many Co-based carbon materials are ideal substitutes for Pt-based catalysts, such as  $Co-N_x$  [27, 28], Co NPs [29], oxides (CoO,  $Co_3O_4$ ) [30, 31], and chalcogenide (CoSe<sub>2</sub>) [32, 33]. Co-based N-doped carbon materials are considered to be the most promising catalysts because of their relative abundance, high activity and stability [34, 35]. Moreover, recent studies have shown that Co NPs can catalyze the formation of CNTs at high temperature [36, 37]. Therefore, it is important to explore novel methods of synthesizing N-doped CNTs supported by metal NPs.

Herein, we adopted a simple two-step pyrolysis method to synthesize Co,N-doped carbon nanocomposites entangled with Co NPs embedded in CNTs (Co@NC-ZM). On the one hand, Co NPs can catalyze the formation of CNTs at high temperature, forming a unique nanocomposite morphology. On the other hand, the better conductivity and larger electrochemical surface area of Co@NC-ZM can facilitate the electron transfer and exposure of active sites. Meanwhile, Co@NC-ZM exhibits better ORR activity, stability, and methanol tolerance than the standard Pt/C catalyst. Therefore, this work is of great significance to the study of non-preciousmetal-doped carbon materials for ORR.

#### 2. Experimental section

# 2.1. Materials

Zn(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>·6H<sub>2</sub>O, 2-methylimidazole, melamine, cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc) and methanol were obtained from Aladdin. Pt/C (20 wt%) and Nafion (5 wt%) were obtained from Johnson Matthey and Sigma-Aldrich, respectively.

#### 2.2. Catalyst preparation

2.2.1. Synthesis of ZIF-8. The ZIF-8 was synthesized according to the literature with some modifications [38]. In detail, 7.140 g of Zn(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>·6H<sub>2</sub>O was dissolved into 40 ml of methanol, which was named solution A. Meanwhile, 10.5080 g of 2-methylimidazole was dissolved into 120 ml of methanol, which was named solution B. Solution A was then poured into solution B under vigorous stirring. After stirring for 24 h, the product was obtained by centrifugation, washed with methanol, and vacuum dried.

2.2.2. Synthesis of Co@NC-ZM. A mixture of 400 mg of ZIF-8, 800 mg of melamine, 50 mg of CoPc, and 60 ml of methanol was obtained under stirring, and the final mixture was stirred constantly for 12 h at room temperature. The product was obtained by drying at 60 °C overnight. After uniformly grinding, the obtained powder was carbonized under N<sub>2</sub> atmosphere at 900 °C for 3 h with a heating ramp of 3 °C min<sup>-1</sup>. After cooling to room temperature, Co@NC-ZM

was obtained. For comparison, N-doped carbon without CoPc (NC-ZM) and Co-doped carbon without melamine (Co@NC-Z) were prepared by the same experimental steps. The blank sample was also prepared by the same procedure without adding CoPc and melamine (NC).

#### 2.3. Electrochemical measurements

The area of the glassy carbon electrode (GCE) was 0.07 cm<sup>2</sup>. The GCE was used for cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). For the rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE), the surface areas of the disk electrode (GC) and ring electrode (Pt) were 0.126 and 0.188 cm<sup>2</sup>, respectively. A 4 mg quantity of catalyst powder was dissolved in a mixture (2.0 ml) of water, isopropyl alcohol, and Nafion (5.0 wt%) with a volume ratio of 20:1:0.075 (v/v/v). After sonicating for 2 h, 54  $\mu$ l (9  $\mu$ l each time, six times) of the homogeneous ink was transferred onto the RRDE surface with a loading amount of 0.857 mg cm<sup>-2</sup>, and then dried under infrared light. For comparison, a Pt/C-modified RRDE was prepared by the same method with a loading amount of 0.025 mg<sub>Pt</sub> cm<sup>-2</sup>. All electrochemical experiments were conducted in a three-electrode system. The modified electrode, Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl solution), and a graphitic rod were used as the working electrode, reference electrode, and counter electrode, respectively. To obtain the potential against the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), the potential measured against the Ag/AgCl electrode was substituted into equation: E (versus RHE) = E (versus Ag/ AgCl) + 0.059 pH + 0.197 V. EIS of the prepared catalysts was obtained at 0.25 V. The amplitude was set as 5 mV and the frequency range was 0.01-100 000 Hz.

The RRDE tests were set at the ring potential of 1.164 V (versus RHE) to measure the  $HO_2^-$  yield  $(HO_2^-\%)$  in ORR. The electron transfer number (*n*) and  $HO_2^-\%$  of the prepared catalysts were computed according to the following equations:

$$\begin{split} HO_2^-\% &= \frac{200\frac{I_r}{N}}{I_d + \frac{I_r}{N}}\\ n &= \frac{4I_d}{I_d + \frac{I_r}{N}} \end{split}$$

where  $I_d$  is the disk current,  $I_r$  is the ring current, and N is the current collection efficient of RRDE (0.44).

These can also be calculated by the Koutecky–Levich (K-L) equation:

$$\frac{1}{J} = \frac{1}{J_L} + \frac{1}{J_K} = \frac{1}{B\omega^{1/2}} + \frac{1}{J_K}$$
$$B = 0.62 nFC_0 (D_0)^{2/3} V^{-1/6}$$

where J,  $J_{\rm K}$ , and  $J_{\rm D}$  are the measured, kinetic, and limiting current densities, respectively;  $\omega$  is the angular velocity of the rotating disk; n is the electron transfer number; F is the Faraday constant (96 485 C mol<sup>-1</sup>);  $C_0$  is the  $O_2$ -saturated concentration in 0.10 M KOH solution (1.2  $\times$  10<sup>-6</sup> mol

#### 3. Results and discussion

#### 3.1. Characterization

Co@NC-ZM was prepared by a simple two-step method as shown in figure 1. First, ZIF-8 with uniform morphology was synthesized (figure S1(a) (available online at stacks.iop.org/NANO/32/205402/mmedia)). ZIF-8 and melamine were both C and N sources, and CoPc provided the Co source. In addition, ZIF-8 also provided the porous structure. ZIF-8, melamine and CoPc were mixed in methanol and stirred evenly. Then, the solution was evaporated to dryness. Finally, Co@NC-ZM was obtained through high-temperature pyrolysis.

The TEM image of Co@NC-ZM shows a hybrid carbon material twinned with CNTs (figure 2(a)). In addition, the red circle in figure 2(b) indicates the formation of CNTs, and the diameter of the CNTs is about 150 nm (figure 2(c)). After high-temperature pyrolysis, the polyhedral shape of the precursor ZIF-8 was basically maintained and a lot of CNTs were wrapped around it. The SEM image (figure 2(b)) demonstrates that Co@NC-ZM has a rough surface. The vesicle-like

structure fills the entire surface, which is consistent with the vesicular structure on the surface as given in TEM images. In addition, we can see that there are NPs in the CNTs from the TEM images, which can be attributed to the catalysis of Co NPs. Related studies have proven that Co NPs can catalyze carbon materials to form CNTs at high temperatures [36, 37], which supports our view. The sample aggregation and structural collapse after high-temperature calcination can be seen from the SEM image of NC-ZM (figure S1(b)), and the surface becomes rough and wrinkled. However, there are no CNTs in NC-ZM. Compared with Co@NC-ZM, it can be concluded that the formation of CNTs can be ascribed to the existence of Co NPs. Figure S1(c) is the SEM image of NC. NC basically maintains the original morphology of ZIF-8 without structural collapse, and the surface is smooth without bubble structure. The SEM image of Co@NC-Z (figure S1(d)) demonstrates the formation of coral-like structure twinned with ZIF-8 without CNTs. We speculate that Co NPs were not formed, which is consistent with the x-ray diffraction (XRD) result of Co@NC-Z (figure S2). In brief, the result shows that the structure of ZIF-8 is beneficial to stabilizing the carbon frame structure of Co@NC-ZM. Melamine is not only conducive to the formation of vesicle structure, but also improves the formation of CNTs in the presence of CoPc.

(figure 2(d)) show that C, N, O, Co, and Zn are dispersed homogeneously on the prepared catalyst.

XRD was utilized to characterize the structure of the samples. A broad peak at about 25.0° for C(002) appears (figure 3(a)), indicating that all the composites were made of amorphous carbon [39, 40]. Moreover, representative peaks at 44.3°, 51.6° and 76.2° that only appear in Co@NC-ZM belong to the (111), (200) and (220) crystal planes of facecentered-cubic Co (PDF#15-0806), respectively [41, 42]. No diffraction peaks of metal oxides, nitrides or carbides were observed. The XRD results demonstrate that only zerovalent state Co NPs are present in Co@NC-ZM, which is derived from CoPc. Zn atoms are volatilized at 900 °C, making porous N-doped carbon structure [43, 44]. However, Zn in ZIF cannot be completely volatilized, and there is still a small amount of Zn, as shown in figure 2(d). Inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) tests suggested that the Zn content was 0.35% (table S1). However, the peak of Zn species could not be detected by XRD because the content of Zn was low. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of Co@NC-ZM was obtained from N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms (figure 3(b)). Compared with those of Co@NC-Z (587.5  $\text{m}^2 \text{ g}^{-1}$ ) and NC-ZM (553.1 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>) as shown in figure S3, the BET specific surface area of Co@NC-ZM (604.7 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>) is larger. Figure 3(c) shows that the mesopore diameter of Co@NC-ZM calculated by the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda desorption method is 3.8 nm. We infer that the formation of mesopores is owing to the incomplete volatilization of Zn atoms at high temperatures. The larger specific surface area and porous structure of Co@NC-ZM is advantageous to expose more active sites and improve the electrocatalytic ORR activity.

To further explore the elemental composition of the prepared catalyst, we conducted x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. As revealed in figure 4(a), Co@NC-ZM is composed of C, N, O and Co elements. The atomic contents of each element are shown in table S2; the contents of C, N, O, Co, and Zn are 80.79%, 1.94%, 16.54%, 0.61%, and 0.12%, respectively. The results of Co and Zn are consistent with those of ICP-OES data in table S1. As shown in figure S4(a) and table S2, XPS proved that the N content of NC-ZM (4.71%) was higher than that of NC (1.23%). The

high N content of NC-ZM is attributed to the abundant N content in melamine. The ORR activity can be promoted by abundant N doping via modulation of the charge distribution of adjacent C atoms to facilitate intermediate adsorption [45]. The bonding type of C in Co@NC-ZM is revealed by the C 1s spectrum, which can be resolved into C=C (284.5 eV), C=N&C-O (286.1 eV) and O-C=O (288.4 eV) (figure 4(b)) [42]. The XPS spectrum for N 1s (figure 4(c)) of Co@NC-ZM can be divided into pyridinic N (397.9 eV), pyrrolic N (400.1 eV), and graphitic N (401.8 eV). The pyridinic N accounts for a large percentage of 43.3%. It has been reported that a high proportion of pyridinic N can increase current density, spin density, and the density of  $\pi$  states of C atoms near the Fermi level, which can boost activity of the catalyst [46–49]. The high-resolution XPS spectrum of Zn is shown in figure S4(b). Weak peaks of Zn  $2p_{3/2}$  (1021 eV) and Zn  $2p_{1/2}$ (1044 eV) can be observed due to the relatively low content of Zn in Co@NC-ZM [50, 51]. At the same time, we tested the 2p energy level of the Co element. The Co  $2p_{3/2}$  and Co  $2p_{1/2}$ spectra can be attributed to Co<sup>(0)</sup> (780.3 eV), a vibration peak (787.8 eV) and  $Co^{(0)}$  (795.7 eV) (figure 4(d)) [52, 53]. The existence of zerovalent Co proves the successful doping of Co element and the formation of Co NPs. Co NPs embedded in CNTs can provide more catalytic sites for ORR, facilitate electron transfer and improve mass transfer efficiency.

#### 3.2. Electrochemical performance

The ORR performances of Co@NC-ZM, Co@NC-Z, NC-ZM and NC in O<sub>2</sub>-saturated 0.10 M KOH were first studied by CV (figure S6). There is no apparent reduction peak in any of the samples in the N<sub>2</sub>-saturated 0.10 M KOH. Obvious reduction peaks are observed of Co@NC-ZM, Co@NC-Z, and NC-ZM in the O<sub>2</sub>-saturated solution. However, there is no apparent reduction peak for NC. Compared with those of Co@NC-Z (0.739 V) and NC-ZM (0.727 V), the measured peak potential of Co@NC-ZM (0.799 V) is more positive. In order to further compare the ORR catalytic activities of Co@NC-ZM, Co@NC-Z, NC-ZM, NC, and the commercial Pt/C under the same conditions, RRDE tests were conducted in 0.10 M KOH solution saturated with  $O_2$ . As shown in figure 5(a), the ORR Co@NC-ZM performance of  $(E_{\text{onset}} = 0.96 \text{ V},$

 $E_{1/2} = 0.83 \,\mathrm{V}$ ) is much greater than those of Co@NC-Z  $(E_{\text{onset}} = 0.91 \text{ V}, E_{1/2} = 0.81 \text{ V}), \text{ NC-ZM } (E_{\text{onset}} = 0.91 \text{ V},$  $E_{1/2} = 0.75 \text{ V}$ ) and NC  $(E_{\text{onset}} = 0.83 \text{ V}, E_{1/2} = 0.70 \text{ V})$ . Compared with the commercialized Pt/C ( $E_{onset} = 0.96 \,\mathrm{V}$ ,  $E_{1/2} = 0.81 \text{ V}$ ), Co@NC-ZM exhibits a more positive halfwave potential, indicating superior ORR catalytic activity. In addition, we explored the optimum pyrolysis temperature. When the samples were carbonized at different temperatures (800, 900 and 1000 °C), the ORR performance of Co@NC-ZM-900 ( $E_{\text{onset}} = 0.96 \text{ V}, E_{1/2} = 0.83 \text{ V}$ ) was better than those of Co@NC-ZM-800 ( $E_{\text{onset}} = 0.93 \text{ V}, E_{1/2} = 0.80 \text{ V}$ ) and Co@NC-ZM-1000 ( $E_{\text{onset}} = 0.93 \text{ V}$ ,  $E_{1/2} = 0.82 \text{ V}$ ) (figure 5(b)). Raman spectra (figure S5) of Co@NC-ZM carbonized at different temperatures (800, 900 and 1000 °C) exhibit a typical D band at 1340 cm<sup>-1</sup> and G band at 1578 cm<sup>-1</sup>, representing the degree of disordered and graphitized carbon, respectively. The  $I_{\rm D}/I_{\rm G}$  value of Co@NC-ZM-900 (0.92) was very close to Co@NC-ZM-1000 (0.90), and both were smaller than that of Co@NC-ZM-800 (0.97). Therefore, Co@NC-ZM-900 possesses the lower disordered carbon. The excellent activity of Co@NC-ZM makes it one of the best non-precious-metal electrocatalysts for ORR in alkaline solution (table S3). As shown in figure 5(c), the electron transfer number (n) and hydrogen peroxide yield (HO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>%) of the Co@NC-ZM catalyst were computed to be

3.93–3.97 and below 3.5%, respectively. In order to further assess the kinetic property and reaction mechanism of Co@NC-ZM, linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves with various rotation rates ranged from 400 to 2500 rpm were conducted, as shown in figure 5(d). The limited current density of Co@NC-ZM increased with the rotating speed enhanced. The corresponding K-L plots of Co@NC-ZM (figure 5(e)) exhibit good linearity and the number of transfer electrons was computed to be 4.18 over the potential range from 0.35 to 0.65 V. The above results confirm that the ORR process is a 4e<sup>-</sup> dominated pathway in alkaline solution. According to the RRDE curves, the Tafel slopes (figure 5(f)) of Co@NC-ZM, Co@NC-Z, NC-ZM, NC, and the commercial Pt/C are -84, -96, -102, -119, and -105 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. This demonstrates that Co@NC-ZM exhibits a favorable ORR kinetic process in 0.10 M KOH. As shown in figure 5(a), the ORR activity of NC-ZM is better than that of NC, indicating that the addition of melamine can increase the N content and provide more active sites. In addition, the ORR activity of Co@NC-ZM is better than that of NC-ZM. This shows that the addition of CoPc has the following advantages: (1) It introduces Co species to form Co,N-codoped composite, which can provide more active sites. (2) Co NPs catalyze the formation of CNTs from melamine at high temperatures [36, 37]. On the one hand, the

unique morphology of carbon nanocomposites twinned with CNTs is formed. On the other hand, the formation of CNTs has a synergistic catalytic effect on the ORR. Co NPs embedded in CNTs can reduce the local work function of the carbon surface, which is beneficial to the electron transfer between metal NPs and CNTs and accelerates the ORR kinetic process [54]. At the same time, CNTs can also act as a protective layer for Co NPs, forming stable active sites. The above advantages are conducive to increasing conductivity and electroactive area, exposing more catalytic centers, and

increasing the performance of ORR catalysis. Therefore, the Co@NC-ZM catalyst displayed much better ORR performance than Pt/C.

In order to estimate the effective surface area of the prepared catalysts, we evaluated the electrochemical double-layer capacitance ( $C_{\rm dl}$ ). CV curves (figure S7) with a series of scan rates were plotted to determine the function of current density difference ( $\Delta J$ ) against scan rate. The  $C_{\rm dl}$  of Co@NC-ZM (55 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>) is larger than those of Co@NC-Z (33 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>) and NC-ZM (18 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>) and the same as that of NC

(b) Chronoamperometric curves of Co@NC-ZM and Pt/C at 0.52 V in  $O_2$ -saturated 0.10 M KOH solution.

(figure 6(a)). The results show the rough surface of Co@NC-ZM, which can provide more active sites for oxygen electrocatalysis. Moreover, the EIS (figure 6(b)) shows that the Co@NC-ZM catalyst has a smaller internal resistance than Co@NC-Z, NC-ZM and NC. Thus, the smaller electrical resistance of Co@NC-ZM can facilitate charge transfer and enhance electroactivity during ORR.

As shown in figure 7(a), after 3000 CV cycles in 0.10 M KOH, almost no shift occurs in the RRDE curves for Co@NC-ZM, indicating that Co@NC-ZM has good stability. In order to further evaluate the durability, we measured the chronoamperometric curve (figure 7(b)) for 20 000 s of the Co@NC-ZM catalyst and commercialized Pt/C under the same conditions. The current density of Co@NC-ZM was

<span id="page-8-0"></span>maintained at 94.8%, which is higher than that of the commercial Pt/C (82.6%), demonstrating the good durability of Co@NC-ZM. The methanol resistance ability is also important for evaluating the ORR catalysts. As shown in figure [7](#page-7-0)(c), the CV curve of Co@NC-ZM displays negligible change after the injection of 1.0 M methanol. However, typical methanol oxidation peaks appear for the commercial Pt/C under the same conditions (figure [7](#page-7-0)(d)). These results demonstrate the good methanol resistance of Co@NC-ZM in 0.10 M KOH solution.

According to the above characterizations and electrochemical performances, the excellent ORR performance of the Co@NC-ZM can be attributed to the following aspects: (1) ZIF-8 is an ideal precursor due to its regular porous structures, abundant N-containing ligands and sufficiently large surface area. (2) Melamine plays a key role in increasing the surface roughness, the N-doping content and the specific surface area of Co@NC-ZM. (3) Co NPs catalyze the formation of CNTs, which can facilitate electron transport and preserve the microstructure from aggregation and destruction. (4) N is more electronegative than C, so the C atoms adjacent to N present higher positive charge density to improve the ORR catalytic performance.

# 4. Conclusion

In summary, we proposed a simple in situ pyrolysis method to synthesize a unique CNT-entangled Co,N-codoped carbon nanocomposite (Co@NC-ZM). The rich mesoporous structure of Co@NC-ZM, with a large BET surface area and synergetic effect between various species, exhibits superior ORR activity and excellent anti-methanol performance as well as great stability. At the same time, the N doping can change the charge density of adjacent C atoms to facilitate O catalysis. The formation of nanotubes further stabilized the active sites of Co NPs. This work provides new ideas for nonprecious-metal catalysts in ORR, and may even hold significance for the future development of electrocatalysts.

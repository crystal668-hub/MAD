Abstract: The development of high-performance non-precious metal catalysts as an alternative to platinum-based counterparts in fuel cells for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is highly desirable but challenging. In this study, a facile approach for preparing a porous boron-bearing Fe/N/C catalyst by pyrolysis was reported. Asobtained FeCNB-900 with a high surface area (784 m<sup>2</sup> g−1) favored a 4e<sup>−</sup> -reduction pathway for ORR, with a half-wave potential of ~0.86 V vs. RHE and high stability in 0.1 M KOH. Furthermore, anionexchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs) with the use of the FeCNB-900 composite as the cathode catalyst exhibited a maximal power density of 0.172 W cm−2 without back pressure, revealing promise for applications in fuel cells and metal–air batteries. Results revealed that the additional doping of B into Fe/N/C leads to the significant increase in the specific surface area of the catalyst composite and can adjust surface polarities as well as electronic properties and provide more active sites to impart a synergistic effect for boosting catalyst ORR performance.

To improve the current serious environmental pollution and global energy shortage crisis, considerable efforts have been focused on the development of green, renewable energy sources and energy converting devices such as fuel cells and metal–air batteries.[1] Compared with proton-exchange membrane fuel cells with harsh strongly acidic environment, anion-exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs), which operate under alkaline conditions, are more favorable because of the compatibility with various earth-abundant electrocatalysts.[2] However, in these advanced energy conversion devices, the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at the cathode is a key process, which requires a high loading of platinum (Pt) to overcome its sluggish reaction kinetics.[3] Although traditional Pt and noble-metal catalysts exhibit a high electrochemical activity for ORR,[4] their prohibitive cost and limited natural resources hamper their large-scale commercial applications. Hence, it is imperative to develop cost-effective, efficient alternatives using earth-abundant elements for ORR.

 Heteroatom-doped carbon materials as metal-free catalysts have been reported to be efficient ORR electrocatalysts in an

alkaline environment.[5] The inherent structure and electronic properties of carbon-based catalysts are affected by the nature and amount of dopants.[6] Various attempts such as doping nitrogen atoms into the carbon skeleton for fabricating N-doped carbon nanotubes[7] and N-doped graphene,[8] have been reported to be efficient to enhance the ORR catalytic activity. Meanwhile, the ORR activity has been reported to be further enhanced by co-doping with other secondary elements (e.g., B) into N–C materials,[9] related to the synergistic effect provided by the simultaneously doped nitrogen and boron that have different electronegativities (C: 2.55, N: 3.02, and B: 2.05), whereby the carbon surface polarities and its electronic structure are altered. [10]

On the other hand, as cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc) has been reported to be active for catalyzing the ORR,[11] catalysts containing the M/N/C (M = Fe, Co, and Cu) structure have attracted considerable attention due to their highly M–NxC catalytic active sites as well as the inhomogeneous charge distribution and the robustness in electrolytes.[12] Hence, using of heteroatom-doped carbon materials with a metal center is expected to further promote the ORR performance of the catalyst, which has been demonstrated by recent several examples, including Fe or Co, N, and B co-doped nanocomposites that exhibit high ORR performance in metal–air batteries;[13] however, the application of such a catalyst to fuel cells, especially in AEMFCs, is still lacking.

In this study, a new facile method was employed to fabricate Fe-, N-, and B-doped porous carbon nanomaterials as an efficient electrocatalyst for ORR by the thermal treatment of an iron complex of polyvinylimidazole (PVI)-coated carbon black (Black Pearls 2000), cyanamide, and boric acid (Figure 1). The obtained ORR electrocatalyst exhibited a high surface area of ~780 m<sup>2</sup> g−1 as well as extremely high ORR activity, with a halfwave potential of ~0.86 V vs. RHE in a 0.1 M KOH electrolyte. Furthermore, a maximal power density of 0.172 W cm−2 was achieved when it was employed as a cathode catalyst in AEMFCs at 60 °C.

# Results and Discussion

Figure 1 shows the fabrication strategy for the formation of the Fe-, N-, and B-doped catalyst. First, carbon black was uniformly dispersed in a PVI methanol solution, which can coordinate with Fe<sup>3+</sup> because of its abundant N-containing imidazole groups. Uniformly distributed boric acid, cyanamide, and an Fecontaining polymer network were observed on the carbon black surface via solvent evaporation. Pyrolysis of the composites followed by acid leaching generated the B-doped Fe/N/C porous carbon materials. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were recorded to investigate the morphology and structure of the catalysts (Figure 2). A high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image revealed a variety of amorphous porous graphitic carbon as well as sheet-like morphology at the edge of the graphene planes, with no observed metal nanoparticles. SEM images showed rough irregular particles derived from pyrolyzed carbon black (Figure S1). Such a hierarchical porous structure inevitably provided accessible active sites and facilitated effective mass transfer during the electrocatalytic process.

Figure S2 shows the comparison of the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of CNB-900, FeCN-900, FeCNB-800, FeCNB-900, and FeCNB-1000. Two characteristic diffraction peaks of C (002) and (100) at ~25.6 and 43° were observed, corresponding to disordered graphitic carbons. Notably, other peaks corresponding to metallic or metal oxides were not observed, further possibly indicating the presence of ionic Fe, which was consistent with the TEM results. To investigate the surface properties of the composites, N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms were recorded at 77 K. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) specific surface area of FeCNB-900 (784.4 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>) was significantly greater than that of the B-free sample (415.2 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>), suggesting that the addition of boric acid leads to the increase in the specific surface area (Figure 2c). In addition, FeCNB-900 exhibited a higher specific surface area compared to FeCNB-800 (408.1  $\text{m}^2 \text{ g}^{-1}$ ) and FeCNB-1000 (598.6  $\text{m}^2 \text{ g}^{-1}$ ), which were pyrolyzed at 800 and 1000 °C, respectively. The high-specificsurface-area of the composites may provide more access to active sites; hence, a pyrolysis temperature of 900°C is selected for further investigation. Moreover, FeCNB-900 mainly exhibited a pore size distribution centered at 3.8 nm (Figure S3), indicative of a mesoporous structure. For the ORR process, such a porous structure with mesopores was beneficial for the mass transfer of the reactants, possibly leading to the high-performance ORR activity of the electrocatalyst.

The Raman spectra of the as-obtained catalysts were recorded to further confirm their structures. The catalysts exhibited two characteristic peaks at ~1350 and 1590 cm<sup>-1</sup>, corresponding to the D-band and G-band, respectively (Figure 2d). The D peak corresponded to the disordered sp³ carbons, whereas the G peak corresponded to the sp² hybrid carbons present in graphite. Typically, the D/G-band intensity ratio ( $I_D/I_G$ ) is utilized to evaluate the graphitization degree of carbon materials. The smaller the  $I_D/I_G$  ratio suggests the lesser defects in carbon based materials. The  $I_D/I_G$  value of FeCNB-900 was calculated to be 0.98; this value is greater than those of the B-free sample (0.92) and Fe-free sample (0.96), suggesting the disorder of the graphitic structure increases by the additional introduction of B or Fe in catalysts. For FeCNB-800 and FeCNB-1000, the  $I_D/I_G$  value was 0.99 and 0.82, respectively. These

results indicate that a higher temperature produces lower  $I_{\rm D}/I_{\rm G}$  ratio and thus lesser defects in carbon based materials, which may increase the electrical conductivity.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was employed to probe the chemical composition of the catalysts. The XPS survey spectra of FeCNB-900 revealed the presence of C (81.42 at%), O (9.51 at%), B (3.42 at%), N (5.26 at%), and Fe (0.39 at%) in the catalyst composites (Figure 3a).

deconvoluted into five peaks, with binding energies of 398.3 eV, 398.9 eV, 400.0 eV, 400.9 eV and 404.0 eV, corresponding to B–N, pyridinic-N, pyrrolic-N, graphitic-N, and oxidized N,[15] respectively (Figure 3b). Among these nitrogen species, pyridinic nitrogen lies at the edges of the graphene planes, while graphitic-N is incorporated in the carbon lattice. Pyridinic and graphitic nitrogen have been reported to be responsible for ORR in an alkaline electrolyte.[16] Meanwhile, pyridinic nitrogen coordinated with iron atoms to form an Fe–Nx–C structure may work as electrochemical active centers as well. In addition, the high-resolution B 1s spectrum of FeCNB-900 exhibited four peaks at ~190.6 eV, 191.4 eV, 192.3 eV, and 193.1 eV, corresponding to B–N–C, BC3, BC2O, and BCO2 bonds, respectively.[10b, 15b] The B species of FeCNB-900 predominantly originated from the reactions of boric acid, N-containing precursors, and carbon black during heat treatment. Recent research has revealed that the BC3 moiety in doped carbon materials has been considered to be an active group for ORR. [10a] Additionally, the XPS Fe 2p core-level spectrum of the catalysts revealed peaks at 711.6 eV and 724.7 eV, corresponding to Fe 2P3/2 and Fe 2P1/2, respectively.[12d] FeCNB-800 and FeCNB-1000 were also analyzed by XPS and the results revealed an increase of carbon content and decrease of nitrogen, oxygen, boron and iron content with the elevated calcination temperature (Figure S5, S6, Table S1). Although the electrical conductivity of catalysts may be enhanced with elevated pyrolysis temperature, the decrease of heteroatoms contents in the catalysts, however, might significantly affect the ORR performance due to the reduction of active sites.[14]

To investigate the ORR performance of the as-obtained catalysts, cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were conducted in a 0.1 M KOH electrolyte. A well-defined reduction peak for ORR was observed at 0.88 V vs. RHE, indicative of the superior catalytic activity of the FeCNB-900 catalyst toward ORR (Figure 4a); however, only featureless voltammetric currents were recorded in an Ar-saturated electrolyte. Moreover, the ORR electrocatalytic activities of the catalysts were further estimated by LSVs in a 0.1 M KOH solution. For comparison, the B-free sample FeCN-900, Fe-free sample CNB-900, and a commercial 20 wt% Pt/C catalyst (0.3 mg/cm<sup>2</sup> , JM) were also evaluated at a rotation speed of 1600 rpm under the same condition. Typically, the onset potential and half-wave potential of the polarization curves for ORR have been widely used to investigate electrocatalytic activities. Eonset (1.015 V vs. RHE) and E1/2 (0.859 V) values of FeCNB-900 for ORR were close to those of the state-of-the-art commercial Pt/C catalyst (Eonset = 1.05 V, E1/2 = 0.874 V) measured under the same conditions (Figure 4b). On the other hand, the half-wave potential values for B-free FeCN-900 (0.835 V) and Fe-free CNB-900 (0.673 V) were ~24 and ~186 mV less than that of FeCNB-900, suggesting that the doping of both Fe and B in the porous carbon structure can promote the ORR performance.

In addition, the polarization curves of the FeCNB composites obtained at different carbonization temperatures were recorded. The half-wave potential value for FeCNB-900 was greater than that of FeCNB-800 (0.826 V) and FeCNB-1000 (0.786 V), indicating that the FeCNB composites pyrolyzed at 900°C

perform better toward ORR than those pyrolyzed at 800°C and 1000°C. The ORR activity of FeCNB-900 was comparable to those of the non-precious metal electrocatalysts recently reported (Table S2). The high catalytic activity of FeCNB-900 for ORR was possibly related to the hierarchical porous structure and the proposed synergistic effect generated by doping with N, B, and Fe. The ORR kinetics for electrocatalysts was measured by their corresponding Tafel slopes (Figure 4c). FeCNB-900 exhibited a Tafel slope of 73 mV dec−1; this value is near that of Pt/C (71 mV dec−1), showing similar ORR kinetics in alkaline solution.

Rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) measurements were further applied to verify the ORR electrocatalytic pathway of the as-obtained porous carbon materials. The electron transfer number and the yield of HO2 production for ORR was calculated to be 3.96 and 1.9% for FeCNB-900 at a potential of 0.6 V vs. RHE (Table 1), suggesting that FeCNB-900 favors a fourelectron reduction pathway for ORR. However, for B-free FeCN-900, the catalyst exhibited an n value of 3.91 and a HO<sup>2</sup>

percentage yield of 4.6% at 0.6 V vs. RHE. These results further demonstrated the beneficial effects of introducing B into the FeCN-900 catalyst for improving its ORR activity and enhancing 4e<sup>−</sup> -reduction selectivity. This observation is consistent with the above LSV result.

The accelerated durability test was utilized to investigate the stability of the catalyst by cycling the potential between 0.6 and 1.0 V at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 in an O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH solution. After 10000 continuous cycles, the E1/2 value of FeCNB-900 negatively shifted by 18 mV (Figure 4f). In addition, the catalyst stability was also examined by current–time chronoamperometric analysis in an O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH electrolyte (Figure 5a). FeCNB-900 retained ~93% of its initial current after 25 h of continuous operation at 0.65 V. In sharp contrast, Pt/C lost ~48% of its initial activity under the same experimental conditions. These results clearly demonstrated that FeCNB-900 exhibits superior stability over a commercial Pt/C catalyst in basic media.

As an ORR electrocatalyst in direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs), high selectivity for cathode reactions against the oxidation of methanol is crucial. Methanol molecules may penetrate through the membrane from the anode to the cathode, thereby impairing the electrocatalyst performance. Thus, the methanol crossover effect is also investigated in an O2-saturated alkaline solution by chronoamperometric measurements. FeCNB-900 exhibited an almost stable i–t response in the presence of 2 M methanol in an alkaline electrolyte, indicative of good tolerance for the methanol crossover effect. By comparison, Pt/C exhibited a significant decrease in current with the introduction of methanol (Figure 5b). Thus, FeCNB-900 can also be developed as a methanol-tolerant cathode catalyst in DMFCs.

The incorporation of nitrogen into the carbon skeleton has been reported to cause charge delocalization and spin density changes, thereby generating positive charges on adjacent carbon atoms due to the high electronegativity of the nitrogen atom and hence facilitating the adsorption of O2 and breaking of the O–O bond.[17] Previous studies have revealed that the charge delocalization and polarization of carbon frameworks can be further altered by doping boron due to its electropositive nature relative to single N doping; thus, to improve the ORR catalytic activity.[10a] Meanwhile, the formed BC3 species can create a synergistic coupling effect with graphitic-N and pyridinic-N, thereby boosting the electrochemical properties. Notably, the presence of Fe/Nx/C active sites was correlated with the ORR activity, which has been proven to promote the reduction of O2 to H2O via direct 4e<sup>−</sup> pathways.[18] In addition, the presence of a hierarchical porous structure in carbon materials can provide multidimensional electron transport pathways, increasing the electrode–electrolyte interfaces and shortening diffusion pathways. All these favorable features eventually lead to the overall enhancement of the electrocatalytic behavior of FeCNB-900.

In addition, the pyrolysis temperature also have an important impact on the catalyst ORR performance. The N and B contents of FeCNB-800 pyrolyzed at 800 °C were found higher than those of FeCNB-900 and FeCNB-1000, pyrolyzed at 900 °C and 1000 °C, respectively. However, the specific surface area of FeCNB-800 was significantly reduced compared with FeCNB-900 and FeCNB-1000. Pyrolysis at higher temperature may favor the formation of ordered graphitic structure of carbon materials as well as the increased electrical conductivity while at the expense of reducing the contents of doped heteroatoms.[14a,14b] The catalyst FeCNB-900 treated at 900 °C has shown the best ORR activity than those control samples pyrolyzed at other temperatures. Consequently, optimizing the comprehensive properties (including the contents of heteroatoms, specific surface area and the electrical conductivity) of a catalyst is critical for achieving high ORR performance.

In addition, the ORR activity of the FeCNB-900 catalyst in a 0.1 M HClO4 solution was investigated (Figure S8). An E1/2 value of 0.652 V in acidic media was observed. This value is ~160 mV less than that of Pt/C under the same conditions. The onset potential of FeCNB-900 reached 0.85 V. In addition, FeCNB-900 catalyzed the conversion from O2 to H2O via a nearly 4e<sup>−</sup> pathway at potentials ranging from 0.3 to 0.7 V.

 Furthermore, the electrocatalytic activity of FeCNB-900 in H2–O2 AEMFCs was investigated (Figure 6). A membrane electrode assembly (MEA) comprising Pt/C (JM 20 wt%, 2.0 mg cm−2, 0.4 mgPt cm−2) as the anode catalyst for the hydrogen oxidation reaction and a cathode catalyst of FeCNB-900 (2.0 mg cm−2) for ORR was fabricated, with which the open cell voltage of 0.941 V was obtained. And the maximal power density reached 0.172 W cm−2 with a current density of 0.506 A cm−2 at 0.342 V without back pressure at 60°C. The open cell voltage value is comparable to that of AEMFCs operated with Pt/C (JM 20 wt%, 2.0 mg cm−2, 0.4 mgPt cm−2) at the cathode (Eoc = 1.001 V). Although the maximal power density obtained with FeCNB-900 was inferior to that of Pt/C (Pmax = 0.228 W cm−2) under similar conditions, it exceeded most of the previously reported NMPCs (Table S3). These results revealed that additional boron-doped Fe/N/C catalyst demonstrate immense potential for applications in AEMFCs as well as metal–air batteries.

# Conclusions

In this study, a facile method for fabricating Fe, N, and B codoped porous carbon material as an efficient ORR catalyst by the carbonization of cost-effective carbon black encapsulated by an Fe-containing polymer network as well as cyanamide and boric acid was developed. The optimized FeCNB-900 catalyst exhibited high electrocatalytic activity, with the capability of ORR electrocatalysis via a nearly 4e<sup>−</sup> reduction pathway in a basic medium, which was comparable to that of a commercial Pt/C catalyst. In addition, the porous catalyst exhibited superior ORR durability and methanol tolerance than a 20 wt% Pt/C catalyst. In AEM fuel-cell test, the catalyst exhibited a maximal power density of 0.172 W cm−2 without back pressure at 60 °C. This study revealed that the introduction of boron into Fe/N/C produces high-specific-surface-area porous carbon, which can adjust surface polarities as well as electronic properties, and provide more active sites to impart a synergistic effect for boosting ORR performance; hence, this porous carbon demonstrates potential for applications in electrochemical energy conversion and storage.

# Experimental Section

Chemicals: All commercially available reagents were used without further purification unless otherwise noted. High-purity water (≥18.25 M·cm) was used to prepare the aqueous solutions. Carbon black (Black Pearls 2000) was purchased from Cabot Corporation. Pt/C catalyst was commercially provided as 20 wt% Pt on Vulcan XC-72, JM HiSPEC 3000. Polyvinylimidazole (PVI) was prepared according to a previously reported study.[19]

Characterization: Catalyst morphologies were examined by TEM (JEOL JEM-2100) operating at 100 kV. XRD patterns were recorded on an Xray powder diffractometer (D/max2550 V, Rigaku Japan). Raman spectra were recorded on a confocal microscopy Raman spectrometer (Renishaw, RW-1000) with a laser excitation wavelength of 514 nm. XPS profiles were recorded on a Thermo Escalab 250 instrument with a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source (h = 1486.6 eV). All binding energies were referenced to the C1s peak (284.6 eV) corresponding to adventitious carbon. N2 adsorption–desorption data were recorded at liquid nitrogen temperature (77 K) on a Micromeritics ASAP 2010 M apparatus. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method was used to calculate the catalyst surface areas.

#### Catalyst preparation:

#### Treatment of carbon black:

First, carbon black (100 mg) was added to 70% HNO3 (300 mL). Second, the mixture was subjected to sonication for 30 min in a bath sonicator, followed by refluxing at 80 °C with stirring for 8 h and then washed by copious amounts of high-purity water. Finally, the oxidized carbon black was dried overnight at 80 °C under vacuum.

#### Preparation of Fe, N, and B co-doped porous carbon (FeCNB-T):

First, 600 mg of PVI was dissolved in a methanol solution (100 mL). Second, the oxidized carbon black (100 mg) was dispersed into the PVI methanol solution with ultrasonication for 1 h to ensure homogeneity. Third, 10 mL of a methanol solution of FeCl3·6H2O (180 mg) was added to the above solution, and the mixed solution was further stirred at 60°C for 12 h to ensure that iron ions can coordinate to nitrogen-containing sites in PVI. After the reaction, the solvent was then completely evaporated, followed by the collection of the composites and dispersion in deionized water (50 mL) with the addition of boric acid (150 mg) and cyanamide (1 mL), and further stirring for 6 h. Next, the solvent was completely removed under vacuum until sticky composites were obtained. Subsequently, the composites were placed into a quartz tube, followed by pyrolysis under high-purity N2 at a designated temperature for 1 h at a heating rate of 5°C min−1. After pyrolysis, the composites were subjected to acid leaching in hydrochloric acid (4 mol·L−1) for 12 h and washed with abundant deionized (DI) water. Then, the powder was dried overnight at 80°C under vacuum. The as-prepared samples were denoted as FeCNB-T, where T represents the carbonization temperature (800, 900, or 1000°C).

Preparation of Fe and N co-doped porous carbon (FeCN-900): For comparison, Fe and N co-doped porous carbon materials were also prepared by a procedure similar to that for preparing FeCNB-900 without the addition of boric acid.

Preparation of N and B co-doped porous carbon (CNB-900): Similarly, N and B co-doped porous carbon materials were prepared by a procedure similar to that for preparing FeCNB-900 without the addition of  $FeCl_3 \cdot 6H_2O$ .

#### **Electrochemical measurements:**

The catalyst ink was prepared by the addition of 5.0 mg of the as-obtained catalyst to a glass vial with 25  $\mu L$  of a 5 wt% dispersion solution of Nafion (Aldrich) and 225  $\mu L$  of isopropanol. The solution was subjected to sonication in a bath sonicator for 1 h, affording a homogeneous suspension. Then, the catalyst ink (10  $\mu L)$  was applied to the surface of a glassy carbon disk (diameter: 5 mm, geometric area: 0.196 cm²) and dried at room temperature under air, generating a uniform film with a catalyst mass loading of 1.0 mg cm². For comparison, the Pt/C catalyst ink was prepared by a similar method. The mass loading for the reference catalysts Pt/C was 0.3 mg cm².

A RRDE system (Pine Instruments) was used to evaluate the electrochemical properties of the catalysts on a CH Instruments Model 760D electrochemical workstation using a standard three-electrode system in a 0.1 M KOH solution (pH  $\approx$  13). A graphite rod (diameter: 4.0 mm) and a Hg/HgO electrode were used as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively. The electrolyte was bubbled with Ar or O<sub>2</sub> prior to each experiment for at least 30 min. CV experiments were conducted in an O<sub>2</sub>-saturated 0.1 M KOH solution for ORR at a scanning rate of 10 mV s<sup>-1</sup> at room temperature. LSV curves were recorded in an O<sub>2</sub>-saturated 0.1 M KOH solution at a scanning rate of 10 mV s<sup>-1</sup> at rotation speeds of 400, 625, 900, 1225, 1600, or 2025 rpm by using RRDE. Stability tests for ORR were conducted at 0.55 V (vs. RHE) in O<sub>2</sub>-saturated 0.1 M KOH at 900 rpm by using a chronoamperometric method.

**RRDE measurements**: These measurements were carried out to calculate the electron transfer number (n) and the  $H_2O_2$  production yield according to the following equation:

$${\rm H_2O_2(\%)} \, = \, \frac{200 \times {\rm I_r}}{{\rm I_r} \, + \, {\rm N} \times {\rm I_d}}$$

$$n \; = \; \frac{4 \, \times \, N \, \times \, I_{_{d}}}{I_{_{r}} \, + \, N \, \times \, I_{_{d}}} \label{eq:n_def}$$

where Ir is the ring current, Id is the disk current, and N is the collection efficiency.

#### AEMFC test:

The cathode catalyst of FeCNB-900 and 20 wt% Pt/C (Johnson Matthey, 0.4 mg<sub>Pt</sub> cm<sup>-2</sup>) were deposited on the AT-1 anion polymer electrolyte membrane (Hephas Energy Co., Ltd, 30–40  $\mu$ m in thickness) with a catalyst loading of 2.0 mg cm<sup>-2</sup>. For the anode catalyst, 20 wt% Pt/C (Johnson Matthey, 0.4 mg<sub>Pt</sub> cm<sup>-2</sup>) was prepared by the same method on the anode side of the membrane. MEAs with an active area of 1 cm<sup>2</sup> were prepared by using the aQAPS-S14 ionomer solution (Hephas Energy Co., Ltd) by the catalyst-coated membrane method. Polarization curves were recorded on a fuel cell test station (Hephas Mini-M50 Test Equipment) in the voltage control mode. Fuel cell performance was investigated at 60 °C with H<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> at flow rates of 200 mL min<sup>-1</sup> at

100% RH without back pressure.

A facile approach for preparing a porous boron-doped Fe/N/C catalyst for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) was reported. The additional doping of B into Fe/N/C leads to the significant increase of the specific surface area of the catalyst composite and adjusting surface electronic properties and provide more active sites to impart a synergistic effect for boosting the ORR performance.

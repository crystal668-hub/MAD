#### **Abstract**

Looking for non-noble metal catalysts with low cost, high activity, and high stability to replace platinum in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) has aroused great concern. According to previous studies, Fe-Nx/C material is one of the most promising non-noble metal catalysts for ORR. In this study, new Fe-Nx/C material was synthesized by introducing CeO2 and Fe3O4 nanoparticles into a Fe-Nx/C material derived from ZIF-8 as precursors. The new material was called CeO2-Fe3O4@Fe-N/C catalyst and the activity of the catalyst was found to be significantly improved in 0.1 mol L−<sup>1</sup> KOH. The half-wave potential of CeO2- Fe3O4@Fe-N/C (0.892 V) is higher than that of Pt/C by 67 mV. In the stability test, the half-wave potential of CeO2-Fe3O4@Fe-N/C was only reduced by 4 mV after 5,000 cycles. The high performance is attributed to the introduction of CeO2 and Fe3O4, which gives CeO2-Fe3O4@Fe-N/C enhanced electrocatalytic activity and long-term stability. This approach makes CeO2-Fe3O4@Fe-N/C a promising candidate for cathode catalysts in renewable energy conversion devices.

# **1 INTRODUCTION**

Hydrogen and fuel cell technologies have attracted extensive attention because of their high energy conversion efficiency and environmental protection [\[1–5\]](#page-6-0). At present, the main factor limiting the application of fuel cells is the kinetics of ORR reaction is rather slow on the cathode, which limits the total efficiency of fuel cells [\[6,7\]](#page-6-0). The fourelectron ORR is a very spontaneous reaction in H2/O2 fuel cells, but its kinetics are sluggish on most electrode surfaces because it involves several electron transfer steps and consequently several activation barriers [\[8–11\]](#page-6-0). The ORR at the cathode represents the bottleneck in fuel cell performance [\[12\]](#page-7-0). Therefore, it is particularly important to develop a cathode catalyst that can reduce ORR overpotential and accelerate its reaction rate [\[13,14\]](#page-7-0). Nowadays, the cathode electrocatalysts of most commercial fuel cells are still platinum-based catalysts [\[15\]](#page-7-0). However, platinumbased electrocatalysts have the main disadvantages of high cost and low reserves [\[16,17\]](#page-7-0). In recent years, the research and development of non-noble metal catalysts have been deepening, and the outcomes of the research showed that Pt-based catalysts may be replaced by non-noble metal catalysts [\[18–23\]](#page-7-0). In particular, Fe-Nx/C catalysts have been extensively studied [\[24–26\]](#page-7-0). Fe-Nx/C catalyst possesses molecular-type of active sites, on which a single Fe ion can coordinate with N-containing functional group on the edge of carbon base plane, which can effectively optimize the O2

adsorption in the ORR process and thus improve the activity of ORR [\[27\]](#page-7-0). However, the metal atoms of Fe-Nx/C catalysts are easily aggregated into larger particles especially at elevated temperatures, hence resulting in low-density active sites. Thus, it is of great importance to develop a new Fe-Nx/C ORR catalyst with high stability and high activity for the practical application of fuel cells.

In recent years, many researchers have reported that the coupling of carbon-based composites and transition metal oxides can improve its ORR activity [\[28–32\]](#page-7-0). At the atomic scale, the tunable site configuration, from central metal atoms, coordinated heteroatoms, peripheral dopants, and feasible polymetallic centers to the synergetic intrinsic carbon defects, can effectively augment the intrinsic activity for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) [\[33–35\]](#page-7-0). Transition metal oxides can effectively catalyze ORR by providing chemisorption sites of donor-acceptor for reversible adsorption of oxygen molecules [\[36,37\]](#page-7-0). CeO2, a member of the rare earth family, has been proposed to provide the reaction site due to its abundant oxygen vacancies and rapid transition between Ce3<sup>+</sup> and Ce4<sup>+</sup> [\[38\]](#page-7-0), which is conducive to the activation of reactants when the catalytic reaction occurs.

Ce4<sup>+</sup> in CeO2 can realize the rapid conversion between Ce3<sup>+</sup> and Ce4<sup>+</sup> through the formation and elimination of oxygen vacancies, so the storage and release of oxygen species can be realized through the redox conversion of (Ce3+/Ce4+) under certain conditions [\[39,40\]](#page-7-0). Oxygen vacancies are able to anchor the metal nanoparticles, hence, preventing aggregation and improving the dispersion of metallic nanoparticles. The newly formed Ce3+/Ce4<sup>+</sup> pairs as a conductive network can improve the overall conductivity of the catalyst and inhibit the accumulation of electrons around the Fe-Nx active sites, thereby protecting the Fe-Nx sites from being destroyed by the electrochemical reaction.

The poor electrical conductivity of pure CeO2 leads to low electrocatalytic activity [\[41\]](#page-7-0). Meanwhile, the introduction of carbonitride materials not only can improve stability but also enhance conductivity [\[42–45\]](#page-7-0). Yue Yu *et al*. have prepared a CeO2@ZIF-8 catalyst exhibiting better activity than Pt/C (*E1/2* = 0.908V) with an average of three spherical CeO2 nanoparticles in the doped ZIF-8 catalyst [\[46\]](#page-7-0). Hongming Sun *et al*successfully doped Ce(NO3)3 into Co4N in the form of CeO2 by high-temperature treatment [\[47\]](#page-7-0). Meanwhile, CeO2 as a known active oxygen scavenger protective membrane in fuel cells is an example of its effectiveness [\[48\]](#page-7-0).

In this paper, an efficient ORR electrocatalyst CeO2- Fe3O4@Fe-N/C was synthesized by mixing Fe(NO3)3, Ce(NO3)3 with ZIF-8 precursors and then thermal reaction. Compared with a large number of ORR catalysts prepared by other researchers, CeO2-Fe3O4@Fe-N/C shows better catalytic performance.

# **2 EXPERIMENTAL SECTION**

# **2.1 Chemicals**

In this study, C4H6O4Zn⋅2H2O (≥99%) was purchased from the Sino Pharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd., while 2-Methylimidazole (98%), Fe(NO3)3⋅9H2O, Methanol (≥99.9%), Potassium hydroxide and Ce(NO3)3⋅6H2O (99.95%) were purchased from Shanghai Aladdin Biochemical Technology Co., Ltd. Nafion emulsion (5 wt%) was purchased from E. l. DuPont de Nemours and Company, DuPont. Isopropyl alcohol was purchased from Guangdong Guanghua Technology Co., Ltd. The 40% Pt/C catalyst produced by Johnson Matthey (HISPEC 4000) was used for benchmarking purposes.

# **2.2 Catalyst synthesis**

The synthesis process of CeO2-Fe3O4@Fe-N/C is shown in Scheme [1.](#page-2-0) In the first step, the mixture of C4H6O4Zn⋅2H2O, 2-Methylimidazole, and water (mass ratio of 1:4:500) is stirred (500 rpm) at room temperature for 15 minutes, centrifuged, and dried in 70◦C overnight. The resulting sample is designated as a ZIF-8 precursor. After mixing and sonicating ZIF-8 precursor with anhydrous methanol for 10 min, it was mixed with an anhydrous methanol solution of Fe(NO3)3⋅9H2O and stirred for 2h. Then, a methanol solution of Ce(NO3)3⋅6H2O was added and stirred with it for 1 h., and the mixture was continuously stirred for 1 h. Then washed and filtered the suspension and dried at 70◦C overnight. Finally, it is heated to 900 at 10 °C/min in a tubular furnace and reacts for 1 h. The resulting sample was expressed as CeO2-Fe3O4@Fe-N/C. Other prepared materials such as Ce-ZIF', ZIF', and Fe3O4@Fe-N/C were prepared by not adding Ce(NO3)3⋅6H2O/Ce(NO3)3⋅6H2O and Fe(NO3)3⋅9H2O/Fe(NO3)3⋅9H2O in the mixing stage, respectively.

# **2.3 Characterization**

The scanning rate of X-ray diffraction (XRD) is 5◦/min, ranging from 5 to 90◦. The morphology was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM; Zeiss Sigma 300) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM; JEOL JEM 2100F). Raman spectra were analyzed using a 532 nm excited laser on a Leica MZ20-FC microscope. Xray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was tested using Thermo Scientific k-alpha. Thermo-gravimetric analysis was tested on STA 2500. Brunauer–Emmett–Teller was tested by Micromeritics, ASAP 2460 3.01. Inductively coupled plasma–mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) test was carried out on Agilent 7700 ICAP RQ inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer to analyze Fe and Ce elements.

# **2.4 Electrochemical test**

The electrochemical workstation of the Solartron analytical 1470e battery test system was used to test with a three-electrode system at 0.1 mol L−<sup>1</sup> KOH. Mixed 1 ml of isopropanol and 1 ml of deionized water, and then add 70*μ*l Nafion (5%) and 10mg catalyst to prepare ink. The working electrode was prepared by dropping ink on the rotating disk electrode (Diameter = 5mm). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was measured at an open-circuit voltage in the frequency range of 100 kHz to 0. 01 Hz and the potential amplitude was 5 mV [\[24\]](#page-7-0).

Cyclic voltammograms (CVs) at different scan rates (20, 40, 60, 80, 100, and 120 mV s–1) were measured in an O2 saturated 0.1 mol L−<sup>1</sup> KOH solution in the range of 1.10 to 1.20 V. The difference between the positive and negative scan current densities corresponding to a median voltage of 1.15 V is plotted against the scan rate, and the slope is the electric double-layer capacitance (*C*dl). There is a positive correlation between *C*dl and the electrochemical surface area (ECSA). In this paper, the *C*dl value was used to evaluate ECSA.

The long-term stability of catalysts was investigated using an accelerated life test (ALT) and chronoamperometry test. The ALT test was cycled for 5000 cycles between 0.6 and 1.0 V, and the chronoamperometry was tested for 10 000 s at 0.85 V. All potentials reported in this study were referenced to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) according to the Nernst equation (1):

$$E_{RHE} = E_{Hg/HgO} + 0.0591 \times pH + 0.098.$$
 (1)

The electron transfer number (*n*) and hydrogen peroxide yield (%-H2O2) are calculated by the following Formulas (2) and (3):

$$n = \frac{4I_{disk}}{I_{ring}/N + I_{disk}} \tag{2}$$

$$\%H_2 O_2 = \frac{2I_{ring}/N}{I_{ring}/N + I_{disk}} \times 100\%$$
 (3)

The value of *N* is determined as 0.37, representing the rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) collection efficiency. *Idisk* and *Iring* are voltammetric currents.

In this paper, the loading of the 40% Pt/C on the disk for the rotating disk electrode (RDE) and RRDE test was 20.4 ug cm-2, and the loading of the other catalysts on the disk for the RDE and RRDE test was 300 ug cm-2.

# **3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION**

To observe the microstructure of CeO2-Fe3O4@Fe-N/C and Fe3O4@Fe-N/C materials, authors first characterized the two materials by SEM. From Figure [1,](#page-3-0) they both form a dodecahedral shape (Figure [1\)](#page-3-0) as described in the paper [\[49,20\]](#page-7-0). Obviously, the particle size of CeO2-Fe3O4@Fe-N/C is more uniform (Figure [1c,d\)](#page-3-0). Which form a large specific surface area to improve the adsorption capacity of O2 on the surface of the material. Compare Figure [1c](#page-3-0) with Figure [1d,](#page-3-0) the surface of the CeO2-Fe3O4@Fe-N/C particle is covered with a large amount of nanoparticles, presumably CeO2.

<span id="page-3-0"></span>**FIGURE 1** Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of (a, c) Fe3O4@Fe-N/C and (b, d) CeO2-Fe3O4@Fe-N/C

TEM test of CeO2-Fe3O4@Fe-N/C is shown in Figure [2.](#page-4-0) A large number of nanoparticles do exist to be observed on the surface of CeO2-Fe3O4@Fe-N/C from Figure [2a,](#page-4-0) and the average particle size is 16. 5 nm. Figure [2b,c](#page-4-0) shows the HRTEM images corresponding to the two red regions of Figure [2a.](#page-4-0) The lattice spacing of 0.274nm and 0.337nm appears on the surface of nanoparticles, which can correspond to (220) (111) of CeO2. Figure [2d–i](#page-4-0) is the mapping diagram of CeO2-Fe3O4@Fe-N/C to each element. Fe and Ce elements are uniformly distributed on the surface (Figure [2g,h\)](#page-4-0), which illustrates the successful doping of Fe and Ce. In addition, C, N, O, Fe, and Ce are uniformly distributed on the material, which indicates that the uniformity of the sample is good.

The structural information of catalysts was further characterized by XRD (Figure [3\)](#page-4-0). The diffraction peaks of Fe3O4@Fe-N/C correspond to Fe3O4 (PDF#88-0315) and Fe (PDF#87-0721). In Addition to the peaks of Fe3O4 and Fe, CeO2-Fe3O4@Fe-N/C has four diffraction peaks of 28.6◦, 33.0◦, 47.4◦, and 56.4◦, corresponding CeO2 (PDF#75-0390). Combined with the results of TEM, it is confirmed that CeO2 crystals are indeed doped into the CeO2-Fe3O4@Fe-N/C material. The crystal sizes of CeO2 and Fe3O4 in CeO2-Fe3O4@Fe-N/C are 17.2 nm and 23.3nm, which were calculated according to the Scherrer equation [\[50\]](#page-7-0). We also do the XRD test on Ce-ZIF' material (Figure S1), and there is no obvious diffraction peak in Ce-ZIF'.

The XPS analysis was carried out on four prepared materials (Figure [4\)](#page-5-0). Ce, Fe, N, C, and O elements signals were detected in CeO2-Fe3O4@Fe-N/C (Figure [4a\)](#page-5-0). The peaks of Ce4<sup>+</sup> and Ce3<sup>+</sup> can be observed in the Ce 3d spectrum (Figure S2a and Table S1) [\[51\]](#page-7-0). Oxygen vacancies and unsaturated chemical bonds are introduced into CeO2 nanoparticles owing to the existence of Ce3<sup>+</sup> and result in charge imbalance. Five peaks of Fe 2p were synthesized (Figure [4b\)](#page-5-0), including Fe 2p1/2 (Fe2+, Fe3<sup>+</sup>), Fe 2p3/2 (Fe2+, Fe3+) and satellite peak. The co-existence of Fe2<sup>+</sup> and Fe3<sup>+</sup> in CeO2-Fe3O4@Fe-N/C is shown. The N 1s spectrum of CeO2-Fe3O4@Fe-N/C observed a Fe-N peak at the binding energy of 399.7 eV (Figure [4c\)](#page-5-0). The nitrogen atoms in CeO2-Fe3O4@Fe-N/C mainly exist in pyridine-N (26. 89%), Fe-N (23. 13%), and graphite-N (31. 97%) [\[52–54\]](#page-7-0) (Figure [4c\)](#page-5-0). Previous studies have shown that pyridine-N and Fe-N can significantly enhance the electron transfer of oxides [\[55\]](#page-7-0), which makes a great contribution to ORR activity. Graphitic-N is believed to enhance the chemisorption of O2 and induce the nitrogen dopant to proceed in an efficient four-electron transfer pathway [\[56,57\]](#page-7-0). The O1s spectrum of CeO2-Fe3O4@Fe-N/C can be fitted into three peaks of O*α*, O*<sup>β</sup>* and O*<sup>γ</sup>* (Figure [4d\)](#page-5-0), corresponding to lattice oxygen (O*α*), oxygen vacancy (O*β*) [\[58\]](#page-7-0) and surface adsorbed water (O*γ*) [\[59\]](#page-7-0) in the metal-oxygen bond, respectively. Oxygen vacancy can improve the conductivity of the material and reduce the activation energy of ORR by promoting the adsorption of water molecules on catalyst [\[60,61\]](#page-7-0). The activity of the catalyst ORR was then improved. XPS tests were performed on Ce-ZIF' and ZIF' (Figure [4e\)](#page-5-0). It can be seen that a small amount of Ce element is present in Ce-ZIF'. Comparing the Ce 3d spectra of CeO2-Fe3O4@Fe-N/C and Ce-ZIF' (Figure [4f\)](#page-5-0), it is found that there are two peaks (885.6 and 903.4 eV) representing the oxidation state of Ce3<sup>+</sup> in Ce-ZIF'. Combined with the XRD result, there is no CeO2 crystal in Ce-ZIF'. The contents of each element in the four prepared materials are shown in Tables S8 and S9.

Raman test results are shown in Figure [5a.](#page-5-0) The relative intensity ratio (ID/IG) of the peak indicates the degree of disorder of the material [\[62\]](#page-7-0). Obviously, the ID/IG value of CeO2-Fe3O4@Fe-N/C is the highest (1.22>0.97>0.93). The high ID/IG value proves the structural defect of CeO2- Fe3O4@Fe-N/C, which is very beneficial to improving its ORR activity [\[63–65\]](#page-7-0). Figure [5b](#page-5-0) is the N2 adsorptiondesorption curve of CeO2-Fe3O4@Fe-N/C, which can be seen to conform to the type IV curve, proving that the material is rich in mesopores. The pore size distribution (Figure [5b](#page-5-0) inset) is the same as that of Fe3O4@Fe-N/C (Figure S4a), mainly concentrated at 3.9 nm. Figure S4b is a comparison chart of the pore diameters of 1–10 nm in the two materials, and the CeO2-Fe3O4@Fe-N/C has more pore diameters of 3–10 nm. In addition, CeO2-Fe3O4@Fe-N/C has a high specific surface area (896.7cm<sup>2</sup> g–1), larger pore size (4. 8718 nm), and pore volume (0. 4085cm3 g–1) (Table S10). We measured its content of Fe and Ce by ICP-MS (Table S11) and the oxide loading on carbon in CeO2- Fe3O4@Fe-N/C catalyst was 12.28% by TG test (Figure S3).

Figure [6a](#page-6-0) is the cyclic voltammetry curve of CeO2- Fe3O4@Fe-N/C material. It can be seen that there is no obvious peak in the CV curve in the electrolyte saturated

with N2. Conversely, when the electrolyte is saturated with O2, the CV curve shows an obvious oxygen reduction peak (0.74 V), which proves that CeO2-Fe3O4@Fe-N/C has good electrocatalytic sensitivity to ORR. To understand the catalytic performance of the ORR, a comparison is made on linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves with different samples at 1600 rpm (Figure [6b\)](#page-6-0). The *E1/2* of CeO2-Fe3O4@Fe-N/C reaches 0.892 V, which exceeds Fe3O4@Fe-N/C (*E1/2* = 0.865V), commercial Pt/C (*E1/2* = 0.825V), and the most non-noble metal catalysts tested in 0.1M KOH, as shown in Table S12. And its kinetic current density of reaches 3.2786 mA cm–1 at 0.9V as shown in Table S12, which also exceeds Fe3O4@Fe-N/C (*Jk* = 1.1325 mA cm–2). The test result curve of RRDE is shown in Figure S6a–d. Figure S5 is the curves of peroxide yield (%H2O2) and electron transfer number (*n*). It can be seen that the peroxide yields of CeO2-Fe3O4@Fe-N/C, Fe3O4@Fe-N/C, and Pt/C are all below 10% at 0.2–0.8 V. Figure S5a shows the average *n*value of CeO2-Fe3O4@Fe-N/C (3.93) is close to 4, offering the evidence of the four-electron transfer in ORR. The long-term stability of different catalysts was obtained by the chronoamperometry test and ALT. After 10 000 s chronoamperometry test at a potential of 0.85V (Figure [6c\)](#page-6-0), the current of CeO2-Fe3O4@Fe-N/C still retained 85% of the initial current, exceeding Fe3O4@Fe-N/C (53%). After 5000 cycles, the half-wave potential of CeO2-Fe3O4@Fe-N/C has shifted only 4 mV (Figure [6d\)](#page-6-0), which was bet<span id="page-5-0"></span>28 HAO ET AL.

ter than other materials (Figure 6e). CeO<sub>2</sub>-Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>@Fe-N/C material shows excellent long-time stability.

Generally, ECSA is proportional to the  $C_{\rm dl}$ , and the larger the capacitance of the  $C_{\rm dl}$ , the higher the corresponding ECSA. In order to explore the reasons for the improved catalytic activity of  $CeO_2$ -Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>@Fe-N/C, we tested the  $C_{dl}$ of the catalyst by CV, as shown in Figure S7a,b. By further fitting, the C<sub>dl</sub> of CeO<sub>2</sub>-Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>@Fe-N/C catalyst is 7.85 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>, which is higher than that of Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>@Fe-N/C (4.28 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>) (Figure S7c). It may expose more active sites and have higher ORR activity. The Tafel curve was plotted against the LSV curve and compared to the Tafel slope of the lumped catalyst as shown in Figure S7d. The Tafel slope of CeO<sub>2</sub>-Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>@Fe-N/C is 81 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>, which is lower than that of Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>@Fe-N/C (107 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>) without doping  $CeO_2$  and Pt/C (95 mV  $dec^{-1}$ ). The results show that the ORR kinetics of the CeO<sub>2</sub>-Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>@Fe-N/C catalyst is more efficient. EIS was also measured over a frequency range of 100 kHz to 0.01 Hz with an amplitude of 5 mV. Compared with Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>@Fe-N/C, the electron transfer resistance of CeO<sub>2</sub>-Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>@Fe-N/C is significantly low at the opencircuit voltage (Figure S8), showing that the charge transfer of CeO<sub>2</sub>-Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>@Fe-N/C is faster than other catalysts. In addition, in order to evaluate the relationship between the yield of hydrogen peroxide and the thickness of the catalyst layer on the electrode in the RRDE experiment, we carried out the RRDE test on 40% Pt/C catalysts with loading amounts of 10.2 and 20.4  $\mu g$  cm<sup>-2</sup>, respectively. As shown in Figure S9, the yield of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> decreased from 0.70

# **4 CONCLUSION**

CeO2-Fe3O4@Fe-N/C electrocatalyst was successfully prepared in 0.1 mol L−<sup>1</sup> KOH in this paper. It was proved that CeO2 and Fe3O4 nanoparticles were loaded on the surface of Fe-N/C by XRD, SEM, and TEM. The authors concluded this catalyst has a large pore diameter, high specific surface area, and a large number of oxygen vacancies. Its kinetic current density has reached the level of nearly eight times of Pt/C at 0.9 V. The introduction of CeO2 makes the electrochemical activity and long-term stability of the materials. Further, CeO2-Fe3O4@Fe-N/C is proved to have a good four-electron path of ORR. Based on the analysis of *C*dI, Tafel slope, and Nyquist plot, it was found that the CeO2-Fe3O4@Fe-N/C electrocatalyst had higher ECSA, lower electron transfer resistance, and more efficient ORR kinetic. In conclusion, a new Fe-N/C catalyst was developed by loading CeO2 and Fe3O4 nanoparticles on Fe-N/C with ZIF-8 as a precursor. This catalyst has competitive ORR activity compared with a large number of non-noble catalysts.

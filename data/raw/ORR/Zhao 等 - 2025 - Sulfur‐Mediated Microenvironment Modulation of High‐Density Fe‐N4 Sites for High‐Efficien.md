# **Sulfur-Mediated Microenvironment Modulation of High-Density Fe-N4 Sites for High-Efficiency Oxygen Reduction and Cryotolerant Quasi-Solid-State Zinc-Air Batteries**

*Chen Zhao, Bingxian Chu, Hao Nian, Bing Shao, Yu Lu, Fanchao Zhang, Yanggang Wang, and Qiang Xu\**

**Single-atom catalysts (SACs) featuring Fe-N4 active sites hold significant potential for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, achieving high-density Fe-N4 active sites while precisely modulating their microenvironment to enhance ORR activity remains a formidable challenge. Here, an S-mediated strategy is presented for the preparation of Fe single-atom-loaded S,N-doped carbon (FeNSC). This strategy leverages the interactions between S and N during pyrolysis to significantly suppress N loss, thereby achieving a high density of Fe-N4 sites. Concurrently, the precise doping of S into the second coordination shell of Fe-N4 centers modulates their electronic structure, leading to a significant weakening of \*O and \*OH intermediates adsorption during the ORR. Consequently, the FeNSC catalyst exhibits excellent pH-universal ORR performance with half-wave potentials of 0.928 V (0.1 M KOH), 0.806 V (0.1 M HClO4), and 0.755 V (0.1 M phosphate buffer solution). A FeNSC-based quasi-solid-state zinc-air battery (QSS-ZAB) achieves smooth operation over a broad temperature range of −40 to 60 °C. Notably, it sustains continuous operation for over 940 h at −40 °C, showcasing unprecedented cryotolerance. This work provides novel insights into the electronic microenvironment engineering of Fe-N4 sites in SACs for high-efficiency ORR and cryotolerant QSS-ZABs.**

**1. Introduction**

Under the global carbon neutrality strategy, the development of safe, low-cost, and wide-temperature energy storage technologies has emerged as a central focus in the energy materials field.[\[1\]](#page-8-0) The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is critical for the operation of next-generation energy conversion devices such as zinc-air batteries and fuel cells.[\[2\]](#page-8-0) While platinum-group metal (PGM) catalysts remain the benchmark for optimizing ORR performance, their scarcity and high cost fundamentally hinder large-scale battery applications.[\[3\]](#page-8-0) Nonnoble metal single-atom catalysts (NM-SACs) anchored on N-doped carbon substrates have emerged as promising alternatives to PGMs due to their high metal atom utilization efficiency and tunable electronic structures.[\[4\]](#page-8-0) Moreover, advancing atomic-level understanding into ORR mechanisms is essential for rational catalyst design. Consequently, the development of high-performance NM-SACs for ORR, coupled with mechanistic understanding at the atomic scale, remains imperative.

During the investigation of NM-SACs, researchers found that N-doped carbonsupported Fe catalysts demonstrated prominent prospects for the ORR.[\[5\]](#page-8-0) Most

Fe-based SACs reported to date for ORR feature Fe-N4 as the central active site.[\[6\]](#page-8-0) However, during the ORR process, the Fe single-atom content and the excessive adsorption of oxygencontaining intermediates on the Fe-N4 sites limited the overall

catalytic activity.[7] Recent studies demonstrate that introducing heteroatoms (e.g., S, P, Cl, F, I) can modulate the electronic structure of active centers, shift the d-band center position of metals, thereby weakening the adsorption of oxygen-containing intermediates. [8] Current research on heteroatom doping primarily targets the first and second coordination shells of metal centers. Heteroatoms in the second coordination shell, while not directly coordinating with the metal center, modulate the electronic distribution within the local macrocyclic environment of the metal center. This indirect regulation preserves the structural stability of the Fe-N<sub>4</sub> moiety and simultaneously mitigates the strong electronegativity imposed by adjacent N atoms. [9] However, challenges such as spatial control of heteroatom placement, carrier material selection, and doping methodologies have hindered the progress in second shell engineering of metal centers. Thus, designing suitable carriers, developing novel doping strategies, and precisely introducing heteroatoms into the second coordination shell to tailor the microenvironment of active sites, modulating the adsorption of reaction intermediates, and enhancing the immobilization of metal atoms, while establishing atomic-scale structure-activity relationships, remains critical yet challenging objectives.

In this work, we synthesized Fe single-atom-loaded S,Ndoped carbon (FeNSC) via pyrolysis of hydroxythiophenolformaldehyde resin (HFR) coated zeolitic imidazole framework-8 (ZIF-8). The S elements in the outer layer of HFR were utilized to regulate the density and electronic structure of Fe-N<sub>4</sub> sites, which optimized the d-band electronic structure of Fe active centers, effectively weakened the adsorption energy of key intermediates (\*O and \*OH) during the ORR. Therefore, FeNSC exhibited exceptional ORR performance, achieving half-wave potentials (E<sub>1/2</sub>) of 0.928 V in 0.1 M KOH, 0.806 V in 0.1 M HClO<sub>4</sub> and 0.755 V in 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution (PBS). A quasisolid-state zinc-air battery (QSS-ZAB) employing FeNSC as the cathode catalyst demonstrated outstanding cycling stability, operating for over 190 h at 25 °C and 20 mA·cm<sup>-2</sup>, and over 40 h at 60 °C and 20 mA·cm<sup>-2</sup>, surpassing most reported QSS-ZABs. Remarkably, at −40 °C and 5 mA·cm<sup>-2</sup>, the FeNSC-based QSS-ZAB achieved ultra-stable operation for over 940 h, representing a state-of-the-art performance for low-temperature QSS-ZABs. This work provides new insights into heteroatom-mediated optimization of ORR catalysts and advances the development of QSS-ZABs.

#### 2. Results and Discussion

As illustrated in **Figure 1a**, ZIF-8 was initially synthesized through a reaction between zinc nitrate and 2-methylimidazole. Subsequently, Fe(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>·9H<sub>2</sub>O was adsorbed onto ZIF-8 via room-temperature stirring to form ZIF-8@Fe. Following this, a HFR layer was grown in situ on the surface of ZIF-8@Fe, resulting in the composite material ZIF-8@Fe@HFR. The powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns demonstrated that all samples exhibited identical crystalline phases, indicating that the incorporation of Fe and HFR did not disrupt the structural integrity of ZIF-8 (Figure S1, Supporting Information). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were utilized to investigate the morphological features of the materials. As shown in Figures S2 and S3 (Supporting

Information), ZIF-8 displayed smooth and uniform dodecahedral nanoparticles. ZIF-8@Fe maintained the same morphology as pristine ZIF-8 (Figure S4, Supporting Information), confirming that the introduction of Fe did not change the structural morphology. In the SEM and TEM images of ZIF-8@Fe@HFR (Figure 1b; Figure S5, Supporting Information), the HFR outer layer was distinctly visible, evidencing the successful deposition of HFR onto the ZIF-8@Fe surface. Subsequently, ZIF-8, ZIF-8@HFR, ZIF-8@Fe, and ZIF-8@Fe@HFR were pyrolyzed at 1000°C under an Ar atmosphere, yielding N-doped carbon (NC), S,N-doped carbon (NSC), Fe-loaded N-doped carbon (FeNC-1), and FeNSC, respectively. PXRD patterns of all carbonized samples displayed broad peaks at  $\approx 26^{\circ}$  and 44° (Figure S6, Supporting Information), corresponding to the (002) and (101) planes of amorphous carbon, respectively.<sup>[10]</sup> The SEM image showed that FeNSC exhibited a contracted and roughened morphology due to organic ligand decomposition and interfacial stress between the inner/outer layers during pyrolysis (Figure 1c).[11] The TEM image further revealed abundant mesopores in FeNSC (Figure 1d), attributed to ligand pyrolysis during high-temperature carbonization. N<sub>2</sub> adsorption-desorption measurements demonstrated that FeNSC possessed a specific surface area of 703.9 m<sup>2</sup>·g<sup>-1</sup> with H<sub>4</sub>-type hysteresis loops, confirming the existence of mesopores (Figure S7, Supporting Information), consistent with the TEM observations.[12] In contrast, NC exhibited a significantly higher surface area (1315.9 m<sup>2</sup>·g<sup>-1</sup>) due to its microporous structure (Figure S8, Supporting Information). The decrease in specific surface area and increase in pore size observed in FeNC-1 and NSC materials were attributed to the collapse of partial microporous structures induced by the introduction of Fe or S atoms (Figures S9 and S10 and Table S1, Supporting Information).[13]

Aberration-corrected high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) analysis of FeNSC revealed disordered carbon lattices without detectable Fe nanoparticles, indicating that Fe might exist in the form of single atoms (Figure S11, Supporting Information). High magnification HAADF-STEM measurements identified atomicscale bright spots in FeNSC, corresponding to isolated Fe atoms (Figure 1e). Notably, FeNC-1 (without HFR coating) displayed aggregated Fe nanoparticles in HAADF-STEM and energydispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mapping (Figure S12a-d, Supporting Information), demonstrating the critical role of HFR coating in achieving atomic dispersion of Fe. EDS mapping of FeNSC confirmed the uniform distribution of Fe, N, C, and S elements (Figure 1f-j and Table S2, Supporting Information). We observed that the N content in FeNSC (7.50 mass%) was twice that of FeNC-1 (3.70 mass%), confirming that the HFR layer could protectively minimize nitrogen loss from ZIF-8 during pyrolysis. To elucidate the mechanism, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were conducted. As shown in Figure S13a,b (Supporting Information), the doping energy (E<sub>doping</sub>) of S,N-doped graphene (0.97 eV) was significantly lower than that of N-doped graphene (1.69 eV), indicating that the presence of S facilitated N doping into the carbon substrate. To further verify, we grew sulfur-free resorcinol-formaldehyde resin on the ZIF-8@Fe surface (ZIF-8@Fe@RF) and carbonized it to obtain Feloaded carbon material (FeNHC). HAADF-STEM and EDS mapping results revealed that FeNHC exhibited a lower N content (4.78 mass%) than FeNSC, which confirmed that the presence

of S enabled the material to retain more N elements during the pyrolysis process (Figure S14a–d, Supporting Information). The higher N content facilitates the anchoring of more Fe single atoms, thereby increasing the density of Fe-N<sub>4</sub> sites. Inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) revealed Fe loadings of 2.35 wt.% for FeNSC and 1.42 wt.% for FeNC-1 (Table S3, Supporting Information), demonstrating that HFR coating not only facilitated the Fe atomic dispersion but also enhanced the single-atom loading capacity. Raman spectroscopy was used to study the degree of graphitization of carbon materials (Figure S15, Supporting Information), with characteristic peaks at 1350 and 1580 cm $^{-1}$  representing the D and G bands, respectively. Based on the integrated intensity ratio ( $I_{\rm D}/I_{\rm G}$ ) of the D and G bands, FeNC-1 exhibited the lowest  $I_{\rm D}/I_{\rm G}$  value, which

was because the Fe nanoparticles promoted the graphitization of materials  $^{[14]}$ 

To better understand the influence of the introduction of the S element on the local atomic structure and coordination environment of FeNSC, we conducted a comprehensive analysis using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), synchrotron radiation X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES), and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra. The C 1s spectra of FeNSC, FeNC-1, and NSC were deconvoluted into three peaks at 284.8, 286.0, and 287.3 eV, corresponding to C—C, C—N, and C—O/S bonds, respectively (Figure S16a, Supporting Information). In the N 1s spectra (Figure 2a), pyridinic nitrogen, pyrrolic nitrogen, graphitic nitrogen, and oxidized nitrogen were identified in FeNSC, FeNC-1, and NSC. In addition, pyridinic

nitrogen coordinated with a single Fe atom to form Fe—N bonds, as evidenced by the peak at 398.8 eV.[15] Compared to FeNC-1, the Fe-N bonds in FeNSC exhibited a negative shift, indicating electron density enhancement at N sites. The S 2p spectra of FeNSC and NSC both displayed doublet peaks for S 2p<sub>1/2</sub> and S 2p<sub>3/2</sub> (Figure S16b, Supporting Information). Compared to NSC, the XPS S 2p spectrum of FeNSC exhibited a positive shift, indicating a reduction in electron density at the S sites. Combined with the N 1s spectral analysis, these results unequivocally confirmed electron transfer from S to N in FeNSC. The XPS Fe 2p spectra of FeNSC and FeNC-1 both showed four peaks located at 710.0, 713.4, 722.5, and 726.4 eV, assigned to  $Fe^{2+}\ 2p_{3/2},\ Fe^{3+}\ 2p_{3/2},\ Fe^{2+}\ 2p_{1/2},$  and  $Fe^{3+}\ 2p_{1/2},$  respectively, indicating the existence of Fe(II) and Fe(III) species (Figure S17, Supporting Information). In Figure 2b, the Fe K-edge XANES curve of FeNSC revealed an absorption edge intermediate between those of FeO and Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, indicating that the valence state of Fe in FeNSC was between + 2 and + 3. The Fourier transform extended EXAFS curve of FeNSC displayed a prominent peak at  $\approx 1.49$  Å, assigned to the Fe–N bonds (Figure 2c). [16] It is worth noting that no peak at ≈2.20 Å (characteristic of Fe-Fe bonds) was observed, further indicating the atomic dispersion of Fe in the FeNSC, consistent with the HAADF-STEM results. Interestingly, compared to other reference samples, the Fe-N bond length in FeNSC increased, which was attributed to S doping. Furthermore, the absence of characteristic peak for Fe-S bond indicated that S was not directly bonded with Fe atoms.[17] Furthermore, the S L-edge XANES spectrum of FeNSC showed a peak at 163 eV, corresponding to C-S-C coordination species, with no characteristic Fe-S bond peak observed

(<162 eV) (Figure S18, Supporting Information).[18] These results indicated that S was doped into the FeNSC structure but not incorporated into the first coordination shell of the Fe center. Combined with the XPS spectra showing partial electron transfer from S to N atoms, it was demonstrated that S resided in the second coordination shell of Fe. The magnified pre-edge region of the XANES spectra revealed a weakened pre-edge peak at 7112 eV for FeNSC compared to Fe phthalocyanine (FePc), which was indicative of an asymmetric Fe-N coordination.[19] This distortion suggests that S in the second coordination shell perturbed the Fe-N<sub>4</sub> geometry. The FePc structure model was used for EXAFS fitting of FeNSC (Figure \$19a, Supporting Information). The R-space EXAFS fitting curve, K-space EXAFS fitting curve and corresponding structural parameters of FeNSC were shown in Figure 2d and Figure S19b, and Table S4 (Supporting Information), confirming a coordination number of  $\approx$ 4 for Fe atoms. Wavelet transformation (WT) plots of FeNSC manifested a maximum intensity at 6 Å<sup>-1</sup>, consistent with Fe-N/O bonding as verified by comparisons to Fe foil, Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, FeO, and FePc (Figure 2e; Figure S20a,b, Supporting Information). In addition, no intensity maxima associated with Fe-Fe bonds were observed in FeNSC. These results demonstrated that S doping via HFR derivatization simultaneously modulated the geometric configuration and electronic properties of Fe-N₄ active centers.

Notably, HAADF-STEM image and corresponding EDS mapping of FeNC-1 (without HFR coating) revealed aggregated Fe nanoparticles at this loading. Therefore, we synthesized FeNC-2 with reduced iron loading to achieve better dispersion. As shown in Figure S21 (Supporting Information), no obvious Fe nanoparticle peaks appeared in the XRD pattern of FeNC-2.

HAADF-STEM image and EDS mapping showed more uniform Fe dispersion in FeNC-2 than in FeNC-1 (Figure S22a-d, Supporting Information). The electrocatalytic ORR performances of the synthesized catalysts were evaluated in a 0.1 M KOH solution under an O2-saturated atmosphere, with all potentials referenced to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). To investigate the effect of Fe content on catalytic performance, a series of FeNSC catalysts were synthesized with varying amounts of Fe(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>·9H<sub>2</sub>O. As shown in Figure S23 (Supporting Information), the synthesized FeNSC exhibited optimal ORR activity when 4 mg of Fe(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>·9H<sub>2</sub>O was used in the synthesis. From the Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves (Figure 3a), FeNSC exhibited the best half-wave potential ( $E_{1/2}$ ) of 0.928 V (vs. RHE), surpassing FeNC-1 (0.882 V), FeNC-2 (0.901 V), and Pt/C (0.877 V). The metal-free NC (0.791 V) and NSC (0.817 V) exhibited low ORR performance, indicating that the introduction of Fe single atoms played a crucial role in boosting ORR performance. The slope of the curve obtained by linear regression was used to determine the average number of electrons (n) involved in the O<sub>2</sub> reduction process (Figure S24, Supporting Information).<sup>[20]</sup> The results demonstrated that the number of transferred electrons in FeNSC was ≈3.9, indicating that the ORR process reduced O2 to water (Figure \$25, Supporting Information). FeNSC exhibited a high dynamic current density (J<sub>k</sub>) of 23.85 mA·cm<sup>-2</sup> at 0.90 V, which was 4.6 times that of FeNC-2 (5.22 mA·cm<sup>-2</sup>) and 9.8 times that of FeNC-1 (2.43 mA·cm<sup>-2</sup>) (Figure 3b). This performance ranks among the best ORR catalysts reported to date (Table S5, Supporting Information). Tafel slope analysis further confirmed superior kinetics for FeNSC (68 mV·dec<sup>-1</sup>) compared to Pt/C (74 mV·dec<sup>-1</sup>), FeNC-2 (72 mV·dec<sup>-1</sup>), and FeNC-1 (71 mV·dec<sup>-1</sup>) (Figure 3c). As shown in Figure S26 (Supporting Information), the overpotential of FeNSC at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> was 381 mV for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), slightly larger than that of RuO<sub>2</sub> (335 mV). The potential difference of FeNSC for bifunctional OER/ORR was as low as 0.683 V. In addition, FeNSC exhibited a high electrochemical double-layer capacitance (C<sub>dl</sub>) of

40.6 mF·cm<sup>-2</sup> (Figure 3d; Figure S27, Supporting Information), significantly higher than that of FeNC-1 (27.1 mF·cm<sup>-2</sup>), indicating that the developed hierarchical porous structure promoted the exposure and utilization of active sites, effectively increasing the electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) of the material.<sup>[21]</sup> Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements showed the smallest Nyquist curve radius for FeNSC (Figure S28, Supporting Information), indicating the lowest charge transfer resistance (R<sub>ct</sub>), which facilitated electron diffusion kinetics.<sup>[22]</sup> To evaluate the stability of the materials, FeNSC and Pt/C were subjected to continuous accelerated degradation tests (ADT) or chronoamperometry measurements at 0.70 V. When 5 mL of methanol solution was added to the Pt/C electrode during 600 s of current measurement, significant fluctuations occurred and the current could not recover, while FeNSC exhibited only slight fluctuations with rapid current recovery, indicating that FeNSC had excellent methanol tolerance (Figure \$29, Supporting Information). Compared with Pt/C, the negligible change in the  $E_{1/2}$ of FeNSC catalyst after 5000 ADT cycles compared to the initial curve further confirmed its stability (Figure 3e). In addition, FeNSC showed only a 3.1 % current loss after 10 h of operation, while Pt/C exhibited a 28.7% loss (Figure 3f). These results indicated that FeNSC had excellent stability as an electrocatalyst.

Furthermore, the ORR performance of FeNSC was tested in 0.1M HClO<sub>4</sub>. As shown in Figure 3g, FeNSC exhibited outstanding ORR activity under acidic conditions, with an  $E_{1/2}$  of 0.806 V (vs RHE) comparable to Pt/C (0.812 V). The catalyst also demonstrated rapid ORR kinetics with a low Tafel slope of 84 mV  $dec^{-1}$ . FeNSC achieved a high kinetic current density ( $J_k$ ) of 7.84 mA·cm<sup>-2</sup> at 0.80 V in acidic media, surpassing most reported values (Figure 3h and Table S6, Supporting Information). Surprisingly, chronoamperometry and ADT results revealed that FeNSC maintained excellent stability and methanol tolerance in acidic media (Figure 3i; Figure S30, Supporting Information). In addition, the ORR performance of FeNSC was tested in 0.1M PBS. As shown in Figure S31a (Supporting Information), the  $E_{1/2}$  of FeNSC and Pt/C in neutral media were 0.755 and 0.779 V vs RHE, respectively. FeNSC demonstrated rapid ORR kinetics with a low Tafel slope of 133 mV  $dec^{-1}$  compared to that of Pt/C (175 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>). Figure S31b (Supporting Information) showed that compared to Pt/C (3.29 mA·cm<sup>-2</sup>),  $J_k$  at 0.8 V of FeNSC (2.50 mA·cm<sup>-2</sup>) was slightly lower. Surprisingly, ADT results revealed that FeNSC maintained excellent stability in 0.1 M PBS (Figure S31c, Supporting Information). These results demonstrated that FeNSC exhibited excellent ORR performance and stability under both alkaline, acidic, and neutral conditions due to the S-induced modulation of the Fe-N<sub>4</sub> microenvironment.

The regulation mechanism of S introduction on the microenvironment of the Fe-N $_4$  active center was clarified through theoretical calculations, revealing the key factors responsible for the excellent ORR activity of FeNSC. The doping energies of S in the second to fourth coordination shells were calculated (Figure S32a, Supporting Information). Using the energy of site 1 as the reference, the energies of the other sites were higher, indicating that the S-doped configuration at site 1 was the most stable. This was consistent with the XPS and EXAFS results (Figure S32b, Supporting Information). As shown in Figure S33 (Supporting Information), the introduction of S increased the average Fe—N bond length and induced structural asymmetry compared

to the Fe-N<sub>4</sub> structure, consistent with EXAFS observations. Additionally, to investigate why S preferentially doped into the second rather than the first coordination shell, we calculated the formation energy (E<sub>form</sub>) for S-doped in the first coordination shell (Fe-N<sub>3</sub>S) and second coordination shell (Fe-N<sub>4</sub>S) of Fe-N<sub>4</sub> structure. The Fe-N<sub>4</sub>S configuration exhibited a lower  $E_{\rm form}$  (-1.70 eV) compared to Fe-N<sub>3</sub>S (-0.93 eV), demonstrating that S doped into the second coordination shell of Fe-N<sub>4</sub> sites was more stable than in the first coordination shell (Figure S34a,b, Supporting Information). Intermediate models for ORR on Fe-N4 and Fe-N<sub>4</sub>S were established to explore changes in rate-determining steps and free energy (Figures \$35 and \$36, Supporting Information). Figure 4a presents the free energy diagrams for ORR (U = 1.23 V vs RHE) on both structures. The rate-determining step for Fe-N<sub>4</sub> was the conversion of \*OH to H<sub>2</sub>O, with an overpotential of 0.62 V. Since the transformations from \*O to \*OH and \*OH to H<sub>2</sub>O were endothermic processes, weakening the adsorption strength of oxygen-containing intermediates could effectively optimize the reaction kinetics. The introduction of S changed the microenvironment of Fe-N<sub>4</sub> active centers, reducing the overpotential of the \*O to \*OH conversion on Fe-N<sub>4</sub> to 0.46 V. Consequently, compared to the Fe-N<sub>4</sub> structure, the Fe-N<sub>4</sub>S structure was more favorable for ORR. This represented one key reason for the superior ORR activity of FeNSC. Charge density difference maps demonstrated that due to the strong electron-donating ability of S, the N atoms bonded to S exhibited charge accumulation. This resulted in asymmetric charge distribution within the Fe-N<sub>4</sub> structure, optimizing the interaction between the Fe-N<sub>4</sub> active center and ORR intermediates (Figure 4b). Bader charge analysis (Figure 4c) showed that the valence of four N atoms in Fe-N₄ was -1.10. After S doping, the valence state of the N atom (-1.19) adjacent to S changed most significantly, indicating electron transfer from S to N. This was consistent with the XPS results. In contrast, the valence state of Fe center changed by only 0.01 between the Fe-N<sub>4</sub> and Fe-N<sub>4</sub>S structures, demonstrating that S doping had a minimal effect on the Fe valence state. The primary effect was instead on the chemical environment of the N atoms surrounding Fe center. The projected density of states (PDOS) and d-band center positions of Fe in both structures were compared in Figure 4d. S-doping broadened the d-bandwidth, reduced PDOS intensity, and lowered the d-band center energy level. The adsorption of oxygen-containing intermediates on Fe sites resulted in a lower d-band center, which increased the electron occupancy in antibonding orbitals, weakening the intermediated adsorption (Figure 4e). Additionally, the reduced PDOS peak intensity and electron occupancy necessitated a downward shift of the d-band center to maintain the valence stability of Fe. These effects collectively weaken the adsorption of \*O and \*OH intermediates, thereby enhancing the ORR performance.

Considering the excellent ORR performance of FeNSC, FeNSC-based QSS-ZABs were assembled. The battery configuration comprised a zinc plate anode and a cathode of FeNSC or Pt/C-RuO $_2$  (weight ratio = 1:1), a waterproof/breathable air diffusion layer, and nickel foam (**Figure 5a**; Figure S37, Supporting Information). A flexible polyacrylamide gel electrolyte (FPGE) was synthesized in H $_2$ O/dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) solvent system, followed by soaking in aqueous alkaline electrolyte, yielding alkalized FPGE. As DMSO is a highly polar organic solvent and an effective hydrogen bond acceptor, its incorporation into the

electrolyte modulated the hydrogen-bonding network of the aqueous electrolyte, restructured the solvation sheath of Zn<sup>2+</sup>, and thereby enhanced the performance of QSS-ZABs.[23] The photograph manifested the flexibility and transparency of the FPGE hydrogel electrolyte (Figure S38, Supporting Information). The anti-freezing and thermally stable behavior of FPGE was confirmed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) (Figure S39, Supporting Information).[24] Initial room-temperature (25 °C) testing revealed an open-circuit voltage (OCV) of 1.51 V for FeNSC-based QSS-ZAB, exceeding that of Pt/C-RuO<sub>2</sub>-based OSS-ZAB (1.38 V) (Figure 5b). As shown in Figure 5c, at a current density of 284 mA·cm<sup>-2</sup>, the maximum power density of FeNSCbased QSS-ZAB was 200.22 mW·cm<sup>-2</sup>, superior to that of Pt/C-RuO<sub>2</sub> (131.78 mW·cm<sup>-2</sup>). From the trapezoidal discharge curve, FeNSC-based QSS-ZAB provided higher discharge plateaus at each current density compared to Pt/C-RuO<sub>2</sub> (Figure 5d), further highlighting the superiority of FeNSC as an ORR electrocatalyst. [25] All QSS-ZABs were tested at a constant current discharge of 20 mA·cm<sup>-2</sup>. The specific capacity of FeNSC-based QSS-ZAB was 700.5 mAh·g<sup>-1</sup>, higher than that of Pt/C-RuO<sub>2</sub>based QSS-ZAB (509.3 mAh·g<sup>-1</sup>), demonstrating the advantages of FeNSC in energy density and material utilization efficiency (Figure 5e). The long-term discharge/charge cycling was tested at 20 mA·cm<sup>-2</sup> (Figure 5f). FeNSC-based QSS-ZAB operated stably for over 190 h, significantly outperforming FeNC-1-based (31 h) and Pt/C-RuO<sub>2</sub>-based (27 h) QSS-ZABs. Notably, FeNSC-based OSS-ZAB could operate for over 56 h even at 50 mA·cm<sup>-2</sup> (Figure

\$40, Supporting Information). These results demonstrated that FeNSC-based QSS-ZABs exhibited superior performance compared to other recently reported QSS-ZABs (Table \$7, Supporting Information). Owing to its excellent performance, FeNSC-based QSS-ZAB successfully charged a mobile phone (Figure S41, Supporting Information), indicating its practical application potential. Further increasing the operating temperature of the battery to 60 °C, the FeNSC-based QSS-ZAB operated at 20 mA·cm<sup>-2</sup> for over 40 h (Figure \$42, Supporting Information). Compared to 25 °C, the cycle life at 60 °C was significantly shortened due to rapid dehydration of the FPGE at high temperature. To address lowtemperature challenges, QSS-ZABs were tested at -40 °C.[26] As shown in Figure 5g, FeNSC-based QSS-ZAB achieved excellent cycling stability for over 940 h at −40 °C and 5 mA·cm<sup>-2</sup>, surpassing other reported low-temperature QSS-ZABs (Table S8, Supporting Information). This confirmed that FeNSC-based QSS-ZABs retained high activity and stability across a wide temperature range. In addition, the FeNSC catalyst was evaluated as a cathode in membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) for fuel cells. The open circuit voltage of MEA was as high as 0.97 V using H<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub>, suggesting an excellent ORR activity of FeNSC in fuel cell environments. The FeNSC cathode achieved current densities of 0.40 A cm<sup>-2</sup> at 0.7 V and the peak power density could reach 0.53 W cm<sup>-2</sup> (Figure S43, Supporting Information). This demonstrated that the excellent pH-universal ORR performance of FeNSC made it suitable for a wide range of battery applications.

#### 3. Conclusion

In this work, we present a S-mediated microenvironment modulation strategy for Fe-N<sub>4</sub> sites. Through pyrolysis of HFR-coated ZIF-8, we derived a Fe single-atom catalyst (FeNSC) featuring high-density Fe-N<sub>4</sub> sites with S-doped second coordination shells. DFT calculations and experimental studies demonstrated that the presence of S in the second coordination shell effectively modulated the electronic structure of Fe-N<sub>4</sub> sites, reduced the adsorption of \*O and \*OH on the Fe-N<sub>4</sub> sites, and lowered the ORR overpotential. FeNSC exhibited excellent pH-universal ORR activity with  $E_{1/2}$  of up to 0.928 V in 0.1 M KOH, 0.806 V in 0.1 M HClO<sub>4</sub>, and 0.755 V in 0.1 M PBS. FeNSC-based QSS-ZAB exhibited a high peak power density (200.22 mW·cm<sup>-2</sup>) and demonstrating excellent cycling stability, maintaining stable operation for over 190 h at 25 °C and 20 mA·cm<sup>-2</sup>, and over 40 h at 60 °C and 20 mA·cm<sup>-2</sup>. Furthermore, FeNSC-based QSS-ZAB maintained stable operation for over 940 h at −40°C and 5 mA·cm<sup>-2</sup>. This work provides a strategic framework for optimizing SACs through atomic-level heteroatom doping and facilitates the advancement of low-temperature QSS-ZABs.

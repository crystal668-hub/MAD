Two-dimensional carbon nitride (2DCN) materials have emerged as an important class of 2D materials beyond graphene. However, 2DCN materials with nodal-line semimetal characteristic are rarely reported. In this work, a new nodal-line semimetal 2DCN with the stoichiometry  $C_4N_4$  is designed by using density functional theory (DFT) calculations and its application to anchor single-atom catalysts (SACs) for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is investigated. C<sub>4</sub>N<sub>4</sub> is a planar covalent network (sp<sup>2</sup> hybridization) with regular holes formed by the four N atoms, which is dynamically, thermodynamically, and mechanically stable. The nodal line is contributed by the p, orbitals of C and  $p_{x/y}$  orbitals of N atoms.  $C_4N_4$  shows an anisotropic Fermi velocity and high electron mobility. Because of its porous structure, C<sub>4</sub>N<sub>4</sub> can anchor heteroatoms as SACs for electrocatalysis. C<sub>4</sub>N<sub>4</sub> anchored with Fe or Co is shown to be highly active for the ORR with a rather high half-wave potential of around 0.90 V, which is higher than those of SACs on other carbon nitrides. These findings may provide a new strategy to design novel substrates for SACs.

### Introduction

Recently, two-dimensional carbon nitride (2DCN) materials, with the chemical formula  $C_m N_n$  (m and n are the numbers of C and N atoms in the primitive cell, respectively), have emerged as an important class of 2D materials beyond graphene. [1,2] The property of graphene is well known for its Dirac cone at the Fermi level. [3] Different from graphene, 2DCN materials have various electronic, mechanical, and thermal characteristics, depending on the ratios and positions of C/N atoms in the lattice. [4] Because of their structure diversity and electronic properties, 2DCN materials have shown great potential for applications into energy and environment, [5] such as photocatalysis, [6] electrocatalysis, [7] and Li-ion batteries. [8]

Up to now, a variety of 2DCN materials have already been realized experimentally. For example, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>) has been synthesized via several methods (e.g., chemical vapor deposition and thermal polycondensation), and widely used in photocatalysis for its moderate bandgap (  $\approx$  2.7 eV) and suitable band alignments with hydrogen and oxygen evolution energies.<sup>[9-11]</sup> The nitrogenated holey graphene (C2N) was synthesized via a wet-chemical reaction and used in lithium-ion batteries due to its regular holes and suitable bandgap ( $\approx$  1.96 eV). [12,13] Besides these porous 2DCN materials, pore-free honeycomb structure 2D C<sub>3</sub>N had been synthesized via direct pyrolysis, which is a semiconductor with an indirect bandgap ( $\approx$ 0.39 eV). [14-16] In addition, a lot of 2DCN materials had also been predicted theoretically, such as C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>2</sub>,<sup>[17]</sup>  $C_3N_{31}^{[18]}C_4N_{11}^{[19]}C_4N_{31}^{[20]}C_6N_{11}^{[21]}C_6N_{71}^{[22]}$  and  $C_9N_4$ .

Nodal-line semimetal is a new state of quantum matter, in which the conduction and valence bands cross at the Fermi level and form a continuous Dirac loop.[24] The nodal-line structure provides high carrier mobility at the Fermi level, which may be applicable into high-speed electronic devices. [25,26] The nodal-line semimetal was firstly predicted and observed in 3D materials, [27,28] such as all-carbon Mackay-Terrones crystal [29], anti-perovskite Cu<sub>3</sub>PdN, [30] PbTaSe<sub>2</sub>, [31] and ZrSiSe. [32] Lately, many 2D nodal line semimetals, such as X<sub>2</sub>Y (X=Ca, Sr, and Ba; Y=As, Sb, and Bi), [33] X<sub>3</sub>SiTe<sub>6</sub> (X=Ta, Nb), [34] MgB<sub>2</sub>, [35] and B<sub>2</sub>C, [36]have been theoretically predicted. In particular, the nodal-line characteristics have been observed experimentally in Cu<sub>2</sub>Si<sup>[37]</sup> and CuSe, [38] recently. 2DCN may not have the nodal-line electronic structure due to negligible spin-orbit coupling (SOC). However, there are a lot of allotropes in the 2DCN materials, which may lead to nodal-line semimetals.[39] To our knowledge, only one 2DCN structure (C<sub>0</sub>N<sub>a</sub>)<sup>[24]</sup> was reported to have the nodal-line semimetal characteristic. Therefore, more efforts are needed to design novel node-line semimetallic 2DCN materials for multiple applications.

In this work, we predict a new type of nodal line semimetal 2DCN material (C<sub>4</sub>N<sub>4</sub>) based on first-principles calculations. Our results show that 2D C<sub>4</sub>N<sub>4</sub> is thermally, dynamically, and mechanically stable, and exhibits an anisotropic Fermi velocity. 2D C<sub>4</sub>N<sub>4</sub> has high electron mobility and a porous structure, which can facilitate the anchoring of heteroatoms and enable it to be SACs for electrocatalysis. Particularly, we find that Fe- and Co-anchored C<sub>4</sub>N<sub>4</sub> show excellent activity in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) with high half-wave potential value.

### **Results and Discussion**

### Crystal structure and stability

The crystal structure of C<sub>4</sub>N<sub>4</sub> monolayer and its tetragonal primitive unit cell is shown in Figure 1a. The tetragonal structure exhibits the space group of P4/mmm with a lattice constant of a = b = 4.995 Å. The unit cell of  $C_4N_4$  consists of four C atoms and four N atoms. The calculated lengths of the C-N and C-C bonds are 1.330 Å and 1.487 Å, respectively, and the bond angles are 132.49°, 132.49° and 113.76° for of  $\angle N-C-N$ , ∠C–N–C, and ∠N–C–C, respectively. In addition, we find that C<sub>4</sub>N<sub>4</sub> has an exactly planar 2D structure, which is similar to graphene and other 2D carbon nitrides. [12] These geometrical characteristics (planar 2D, bond lengths and bond angles) demonstrate that the chemical bonding in  $C_4N_4$  is the sp<sup>2</sup> (s, p, and p<sub>v</sub>) hybridization, which is confirmed by the electron localization functions (ELF; Figure 1b). In the ELF contour, ELF = 1 corresponds to the perfect location of electron, and ELF=0 means a low electron density[40]. We see that the most of charges are localized in the middle of the C-C and C-N bonds, leading to the graphene-like plane and sp<sup>2</sup> hybridization. The projected densities of states (PDOS; Figure 1c) show the P<sub>x</sub> and P<sub>v</sub> orbitals of N and C atoms are degenerate and the s and p orbitals of N and C atoms are highly overlapped. The overlap of the in-plane projections (s,  $p_x$ , and  $p_v$ ) and the separation with out-of- plane (p<sub>z</sub>) projection indicate further the sp<sup>2</sup> hybridization of C<sub>4</sub>N<sub>4</sub>.

To examine the dynamic stability of the C<sub>4</sub>N<sub>4</sub> monolayer, we calculated its phonon spectrum (Figure 1d). Clearly, the phonon spectrum has no imaginary frequency, suggesting that the  $C_4N_4$ monolayer is dynamically stable.[41] The molecular dynamics (MD) simulations at different temperatures (300, 500, 800 and 1000 K) were carried out to study the thermal stability too (Figure 1e and Figure S1 in the Supporting Information). The C<sub>4</sub>N<sub>4</sub> monolayer can maintain its initial structure well and the energy profiles are stable at the temperature up to 800 K. However, some chemical bonds are broken, and the structure is distorted at 1000 K (Figure S1d). The mean squared displacement (MSD) for all the atoms was calculated to evaluate the structure distortion at different times (Figure S1f). Obviously,

To evaluate the possibility of the material being synthesized, we define the formation energy of  $C_{n_c}N_{n_N}$  as the energy of the reaction given by Equation (1):

the MSD at 1000 K shows a much higher value than others.

Hence, we may conclude that this system becomes unstable

around 1000 K and the maximum temperature that this material

can withstand is up to 800 K.

$$n_{c}C(\text{bulk}) + \frac{n_{N}}{2}N_{2}(g) \rightarrow C_{n_{c}}N_{n_{N}}$$
 (1)

The formation energy per atom in a primitive unit cell was calculated by using Equation (2):

$$E_{\rm f} = (n_{\rm C}E_{\rm C} + \frac{n_{\rm N}}{2}E_{\rm N_2} - E_{\rm C_{n_{\rm C}}N_{n_{\rm N}}})/(n_{\rm C} + n_{\rm N}), \tag{2}$$

where  $E_{\rm C}$  is the chemical potential of carbon in graphene,  $E_{\rm N_2}$  and  $E_{\rm C_{n_c}N_{n_{\rm N}}}$  are the total energies of nitrogen gas and  $C_{n_c}N_{n_{\rm N}}$  monolayer, respectively, and  $n_{\rm C}$  and  $n_{\rm N}$  are the numbers of C and N atoms in the primitive unit cell, respectively. By comparing with other experimentally realized 2D CN materials (CN, C<sub>2</sub>N, and g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>), we see that the C<sub>4</sub>N<sub>4</sub> monolayer shows slightly higher formation energy (0.51 eV per atom) than C<sub>2</sub>N and g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>, but lower than CN (Figure S2), indicating its possibility in synthesis. In addition, we propose a possible route to synthesize the C<sub>4</sub>N<sub>4</sub> monolayer (Figure S3), that is, nitriding the 1,3,5,7-tetroxocane molecule. The overall reaction is given by Equation (3):

$$C_4H_8O_4 + 2N_2 \rightarrow C_4N_4 + 2O_2 + 4H_2,$$
 (3)

and the calculated change of Gibbs free energy of this the reaction is 8.44 eV.

#### Mechanical properties

Furthermore, we evaluated the mechanical stability of 2D  $C_4N_4$  by calculating its linear elastic constants based on Hooke's law.<sup>[42]</sup> The elastic strain energy per unit area of 2D materials can be expressed as Equation (4):

$$E(\varepsilon) = \frac{1}{2}c_{11}\varepsilon_{xx}^2 + \frac{1}{2}c_{22}\varepsilon_{yy}^2 + c_{12}\varepsilon_{xx}\varepsilon_{yy} + 2c_{66}\varepsilon_{xy}^2, \tag{4}$$

here,  $C_{ij}$  (i, j=1, 2, 6) is the in-plane stiffness tensor, [43,44] which can be calculated by postprocessing the VASP-calculated data using the VASPKIT code. [45] The calculated elastic constant values ( $C_{ij}$ ) are  $C_{11}=C_{22}=166.69~\mathrm{N}~\mathrm{m}^{-1}$ ,  $C_{12}=95.55~\mathrm{N}~\mathrm{m}^{-1}$ ,  $C_{66}=86.58~\mathrm{N}~\mathrm{m}^{-1}$ , which satisfy the Born-Huang criteria [46] as:  $C_{11}C_{22}-C_{12}^2>0$  and  $C_{66}>0$  and suggest its mechanical stability. From the calculated elastic constant, we can obtain in-plane Young's modulus along the x and y directions by  $Y_x=(C_{11}C_{22}-C_{12}^2)/C_{22}$ , and  $Y_y=(C_{11}C_{22}-C_{12}^2)/C_{11}$ , and the corresponding Poisson's ratios are  $v_x=C_{12}/C_{22}$  and  $v_y=C_{12}/C_{11}$ . The Young's moduli along the x and y directions are all 112 N m $^{-1}$ , which is lower than that of graphene (340 N m $^{-1}$ ), [47] suggesting that 2D  $C_4N_4$  is much easier to stretch than graphene. The calculated

Poisson's ratio of 2D  $C_4N_4$  is 0.57 along the x and y directions, which is larger than the isotropic upper limit of 0.5. It is known that isotropic and homogenous materials in three dimensions have a Poisson's ratio between 0 and 0.5. However, for anisotropic 2D materials, their Poisson's ratio can be greater than 0.5. [48-52]

To explore the mechanical anisotropy of 2D C<sub>4</sub>N<sub>4</sub>, we calculated the Young's modulus  $Y(\theta)$  and Poisson' ratio  $v(\theta)$  along an arbitrary direction  $(\theta)$  by using Equation (5).<sup>[42,53]</sup>

$$Y(\theta) = \frac{U}{C_{11}\alpha^4 + C_{22}\beta^4 + (V - 2C_{12})\alpha^2\beta^2};$$

$$\vartheta(\theta) = -\frac{(C_{11} + C_{22} - V)\alpha^2\beta^2 - C_{12}(\alpha^4 + \beta^4)}{C_{11}\alpha^4 + C_{22}\beta^4 + (V - 2C_{12})\alpha^2\beta^2}$$
(5)

where  $\alpha$  and  $\beta$  denote  $\sin(\theta)$  and  $\cos(\theta)$ , respectively, and  $U=C_{11}C_{22}-C_{12}^2$ ;  $V=U/C_{66}$ ; The calculated  $Y(\theta)$  and  $v(\theta)$  are shown in Figure 2a and b. From the structural morphology of both  $Y(\theta)$  and  $v(\theta)$ , we can see that  $C_4N_4$  exhibits obvious mechanical anisotropy. Its Young's modulus attains maximum value (209 N m<sup>-1</sup>) at the angles of 45°, 135°, 225°, and 315°, and its minimum (112 N m<sup>-1</sup>) at 0°, 90°, 180 °and 270°. In contrast to Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio has the largest values at 0°, 90°, 180 °and 270° (v=0.57), and the smallest ones at 45°, 135°, 225°, and 315° (v=0.20).

The maximum strain that the new material can withstand is critical to its application. Therefore, we calculated the stressstrain relation by taking the derivative of the energy with respect to the strain, which has been widely used in previous work. [54,55] The uniaxial and biaxial strain were calculated by relaxing the atom positions and lattice constant along the x direction and along the x and y directions, respectively. From the stress-strain relation (Figure 2c), we see that the ultimate strain is 10%, and the corresponding ultimate stress is 29.48 N m<sup>-1</sup> under biaxial tension. For the uniaxial tensile strain, the ultimate strain is 11%, and the corresponding ultimate stress is 13.19 N m<sup>-1</sup>. The ultimate stress, ultimate strain, Young's modulus, and Poisson's ratio of C<sub>4</sub>N<sub>4</sub> and other 2D materials are compared (Table 1). Through comparison with graphene  $(17\%, 34 \text{ N m}^{-1})_{1}^{[56]} \text{ C}_{2}\text{N} (12\%, 32 \text{ N m}^{-1})_{1}^{[57]} \text{ g-C}_{3}\text{N}_{4}$  $(10\%, 59.27 \text{ N m}^{-1})$ , [58] we can conclude that the C<sub>4</sub>N<sub>4</sub> monolayer is flexible because of its lower ultimate stress and similar

ultimate strain. Interestingly, the C<sub>4</sub>N<sub>4</sub> monolayer shows the anisotropic Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio, which may facilitate application in direction-dependent devices.

### **Electronic properties**

After the careful investigation of structural stability, we calculated the band structure of 2D C<sub>4</sub>N<sub>4</sub> as shown in Figure 3a. Here, SOC is not considered because it has little effect on the light elements (Figure S4). We find that there are two touching points, D1 and D2, around the Fermi level along the G-X and M-G lines (Figure 3a), which indicates the semimetallic nature of C<sub>4</sub>N<sub>4</sub>. These two cross points from the Fermi energy is -21 meV and 91 meV for D1 and D2, respectively. From the atomic orbital resolved band structure, where the sizes of the circles are proportional to the weight of the related orbital contributions, we find that the two crossing points near the Fermi level stem from the  $p_z$  orbitals of C and  $p_{x/y}$  orbitals of N atoms. To study whether these two crossing points belong to the same nodal line, we calculated the band structure along a series of k-paths (G-a, G-b, G-c, G-d, and G-e), where the points (a, b, c, d, and e) are equidistantly distributed between high symmetrical points, X and M, as shown in Figure 3c and d. Clearly, we obtain a band crossing point around the Fermi level in all the selected k paths. To reveal the energy dispersions of the nodal loop, 3D band structure around point G was calculated in Figure 3b. Clearly, there is a closed nodal loop around the Fermi level. As the gap is generally underestimated by the standard DFT calculations, we further calculated the band structure of C<sub>4</sub>N<sub>4</sub> with the HSE functional (Figure S5a). Obviously, the crossing points remain along the G-X and M-G paths. Because the two crossing points (D1 and D2) are not high-symmetry points, we also calculated the band structures near D1 and D2 by HSE with a denser KPOINTS mesh (Figures S5b,c). Clearly, the gap around D1 and D2 remains zero.

(d) Band dispersions along the paths as indicated in (c).

electronic devices.

In addition, the Fermi velocity  $(v_F)$  is calculated to estimate the corresponding carrier mobility. The Fermi velocity  $(v_F)$  is calculated by the formula  $v_F = \frac{\partial E}{\partial k'}$  where  $\frac{\partial E}{\partial k}$  is the slope of valence or conduction band near the Dirac point, and  $\hbar$  is the Planck constant. The calculated results show that  $C_4N_4$  has anisotropic Fermi velocity, the values of  $v_F$  are  $1.3 \times 10^5$  and  $6.2 \times 10^5$  m s<sup>-1</sup> for D1 and D2 point, respectively, which is the same order of magnitude with that of graphene  $(8.5 \times$  $10^5 \,\mathrm{m\,s^{-1}})^{[61]}$ . The highly anisotropic transport properties of  $\mathrm{C_4N_4}$ 

may find potential application in direction-dependent micro-

# Potential application of C<sub>4</sub>N<sub>4</sub> as a substrate for single atoms

Considering the natural porous structure and intrinsic metallicity of the C<sub>4</sub>N<sub>4</sub> monolayer, it can provide abundant chemically active edge sites for anchoring heteroatoms and good conductivity. $^{[62,63]}$  We expect that  $C_4N_4$  may be a promising substrate to anchor single atoms for electrocatalysis. [64] To examine this possibility, we systematically investigated the binding energy of different metal atoms (M=Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu) adsorbed on 2D C<sub>4</sub>N<sub>4</sub>. First, we calculated the binding energy  $(E_b)$  of a single atom (M=Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu) adsorbed in the hole of the  $2\times2\times1$  C<sub>4</sub>N<sub>4</sub> supercell formed by the four N atoms (Table S1, Figure S6a). The results show all the  $E_{\rm b}$  values are negative, indicating that all the considered metal atoms can be easily anchored on the C<sub>4</sub>N<sub>4</sub> monolayer. In addition, we compared the E<sub>b</sub> with metal-nitrogen-carbon (M–N–C; Figure S6b), which is widely used and greatly developed for single atom catalysis in recent years [65-67]. We can see that the  $E_b$  values of M-C<sub>4</sub>N<sub>4</sub> are more negative than those of M-N-C, indicating that C<sub>4</sub>N<sub>4</sub> is a suitable substrate for anchoring single atoms. The AIMD simulations of Fe– $C_4N_4$  and Co– $C_4N_4$  at 300 K for 10 ps (Figure S7) show their thermal stability too. To estimate the ORR catalytic performance, we first computed the free energy diagrams (Figure 4a) along the four-electron reaction pathway for  $M-C_4N_4$  (M=Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu).

Based on the computational hydrogen electrode (CHE) model, the theoretical limiting potential  $(U_1)$  is calculated by the minimum free energy change ( $U_L = -\Delta G_{min}/e$ ) among the four electrochemical steps.[11, 68-70] The results show that the potential determining steps are the \*OO $\rightarrow$ \*OOH steps with  $U_1$  of 0.44, 0.48, 0.59, 0.05, -0.20 V for M $-\text{C}_4\text{N}_4$  (M = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu). In addition, the adsorption free energy of intermediate (\*OOH, \*OH, \*O) is a reliable descriptor for ORR.[13] The adsorption free energies ( $\Delta G_{*OH}$ , and  $\Delta G_{*O}$  and  $\Delta G_{*OH}$ ) show that  $\Delta G_{*OOH}$  and  $\Delta G_{^*\text{OH}}$ , and  $\Delta G_{^*\text{O}}$  and  $\Delta G_{^*\text{OH}}$  all follow a strong linear relationship by  $\Delta G_{*OH} = 0.65 \Delta G_{*OH} + 3.47$ , and  $\Delta G_{*O} = 1.60 \Delta G_{*OH} + 0.59$ , respectively (Figure 4b). As expected,  $\Delta G_{*O} - \Delta G_{*OH}$  is a good descriptor for  $U_{\rm L}$ , which is consistent with other calculations.<sup>[10]</sup> According to the ORR volcano map (Figure 4c), we find that  $Co-C_4N_4$  is the best one, followed by  $Fe-C_4N_4$ , with the  $U_1$  of 0.59 and 0.49 V, respectively. The structures of different intermediates for ORR are shown in Figure S11. The calculated U<sub>1</sub> values are slightly larger than those of Fe and Co-N-C (0.40 and 0.48 V).[71] To understand the impact of solvation on the performance of ORR, we further calculated the free energy diagram by using the implicit solvation model implemented in VASPsol (Figure S8 and Table S2). Our PBE and PBE with VASPsol calculations all suggest that \*OO→\*OOH step is the potential determining step for the smallest free energy change on Fe and Co-C<sub>4</sub>N<sub>4</sub>. In addition, the PBE with the VASPsol calculation adds an additional downhill (ca. 0.2 eV) for \*OO→\*OOH step due to the solvation effect, leading to an increase in the limiting potential to 0.69 and 0.79 V for Fe- and Co-C<sub>4</sub>N<sub>4</sub>, respectively.

To deeply understand the catalytic performance of the ORR, we simulated its electrochemical polarization curve by performing microkinetic simulations (Please refer to the Supporting Information for more details), which are compared with those of Fe-N-C and Co-N-C. The simulated current densities on M-C<sub>4</sub>N<sub>4</sub> (M=Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu; Figures 5a and S10) show that the catalytic activities of Ni– and  $Cu-C_4N_4$  are negligible. The half-wave potentials (at the current density of  $-3 \text{ mA cm}^{-2}$ ) for Fe-, Co-, and Mn- $C_4N_4$  are 0.90, 0.89 and 0.85 V, respectively. Therefore, we focus on Fe- and Co-C<sub>4</sub>N<sub>4</sub> because they are the most active ORR catalysts in our studies. The current density from the microkinetic simulation was calculated assuming the activation energy of 0.26 eV for the proton transfer on Fe-C<sub>4</sub>N<sub>4</sub>. From the previous work, the proton transfer barrier was 0.4 eV in alkaline solution. [72] In aqueous solution, the theoretical work showed there were only small reaction barriers for the proton transfer (0-0.26 eV), [73] and this barrier was 0.18 eV in

experiment.<sup>[74]</sup> Therefore, we treat the proton transfer barrier as the upper limit in aqueous solution (0.26 eV) for all four electron transfer reactions. The simulated current densities with different activation energy (0.18-0.4 eV) on Fe-C<sub>4</sub>N<sub>4</sub> show that the larger activation energy, the smaller onset-half potential (Figure S9). From the surface coverage pictures (Figure 5c,d), there are two different intermediates (\*OO and \*OH). At low potentials (0-0.6 and 0-0.7 eV for Fe-C<sub>4</sub>N<sub>4</sub> and Co-C<sub>4</sub>N<sub>4</sub>, respectively), the active site is free, which indicates that ORR is easy to occur because each step is exothermic. At slightly higher potential (0.6-0.84 and 0.7–0.98 V for Fe–C<sub>4</sub>N<sub>4</sub> and Co–C<sub>4</sub>N<sub>4</sub>, respectively), the main intermediate is \*OO, indicating that the\*OO--\*OOH step is very sluggish. Then at higher potential, the main intermediate is \*OH, and finally the half-wave potentials for Fe-C<sub>4</sub>N<sub>4</sub> and Co-C<sub>4</sub>N<sub>4</sub> are limited by both the \*OO protonation and \*OH removal. Figure 5b shows the current density predicted by the microkinetic simulations. The half-wave potentials of Fe-C<sub>4</sub>N<sub>4</sub> and Co-C<sub>4</sub>N<sub>4</sub> are 0.90 and 0.89 V, respectively, higher than those of Fe–N–C and Co–N–C (0.52 and 0.85 V, respectively).<sup>[71]</sup> Compared the limiting potential obtained from the thermodynamic analysis (0.59 and 0.49 V for Fe- and Co-C<sub>4</sub>N<sub>4</sub>, respectively) and the half-wave from the microkinetic analysis (0.90 and 0.89 V for Fe— and Co—C₄N₄, respectively), the microkinetic analysis shows a 0.31 and 0.40 V larger for Fe- and Co-C<sub>4</sub>N<sub>4</sub>, respectively, than thermodynamic potential because of the effects of temperature. 0.4 eV barrier can be easily overcome at 298 K, and the overall reaction are still occurred at this barrier, finally led to a much higher half-cell potential. Finally, we believe that Fe–C<sub>4</sub>N<sub>4</sub> and Co–C<sub>4</sub>N<sub>4</sub> shows great potential as electrocatalysts for ORR.

## **Conclusions**

We have investigated a new nodal-line semimetal 2DCN material with the stoichiometry  $C_4N_4$  by using density functional theory calculation. The predicted  $C_4N_4$  is a planar covalent network (sp² hybridization) with regular holes formed by the four N atoms. The nodal line is derived from the  $p_z$  orbitals of C and the  $p_{x/y}$  orbitals of N atoms. The predicted  $C_4N_4$  shows high thermal, dynamic, and mechanical stability and exhibits an anisotropic Fermi velocity  $(1.3\times10^5-6.2\times10^5~m~s^{-1})$ . The 2D  $C_4N_4$  has high electron mobility and a porous structure, which is very helpful for anchoring heteroatoms and for use as single atom catalyst in the field of electrocatalysis. In addition, based on the microkinetic simulations, we predicted that Fe— and Co— $C_4N_4$  show the most active oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity, with a rather high half-wave potential of 0.90 and 0.89 V,

respectively. Our research not only enriches the 2DCN structure with nodal-line semimetallic characteristics, but also reveals its potential applications in the field of single-atom catalysis.

## **Computational Methods**

All the calculations were performed using the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) function of the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) method<sup>[75]</sup> as implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP).[76,77] For the structural optimizations and self-consistent calculations, the plane-wave energy cutoff was set to 500 eV and a 19×19×1 Monkhorst-Pack kpoint mesh was used. The convergence criterion of energy and force were set to  $10^{-7}$  eV and 0.002 eV Å<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. The vacuum was set to 15 Å to avoid the interaction between the 2D monolayer and its image. Phonon spectra were calculated using a 2×2×1 supercell based on a finite displacement method.  $^{\tiny{[78]}}$  In the ORR calculations, the  $2{\times}2{\times}1$  supercells of  $C_4N_4$  were used for structure relaxation and energy calculations with the Monkhorst-Pack k-point mesh of  $5\times5\times1$ , and the convergence criterion of energy and force were set to 10<sup>-6</sup> eV and 0.02 eV  $Å^{-1}$ , respectively. DFT + U with  $U_{\text{eff}} = U$ -J of 3 eV was used to describe the electronic correlation of 3d electrons. [79, 80] The Gibbs free energy was calculated by postprocessing the VASP-calculated data using VASPKIT code. [45] To explore the ORR properties of M-C<sub>4</sub>N<sub>4</sub> (M=Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu), we studied the changes of Gibbs free energy by the computational hydrogen electrode (CHE) model proposed by Nørskov.<sup>[81]</sup> The Gibbs free energy was calculated using the following equation:  $G = E_{DFT} + E_{ZPE} + E_{H} - TS$ , where  $E_{DFT}$ ,  $E_{ZPE}$ ,  $E_{H}$ , T, and S are the total energy, zero-point energy, enthalpy, temperature, and entropy, respectively. Since DFT cannot describe the energy of O<sub>2</sub> well, we calculated the free energy of  $O_2$  molecule  $(G_{O_2})$  by  $G_{O_2} = 2G$  $_{\rm H_2O}-G_{\rm H_2}+4.92$  eV. The free energy correction is listed in Table S3. The free energy change ( $\Delta G$ ) of different steps were calculated at T=298.15 K, pH 0, and U=0 V (vs. SHE) according to Equations (6)-(10):

$$O_2 + * \rightarrow *OO$$
 (6)

$$*OO + H^+ + e^- \rightleftharpoons *OOH$$
 (7)

$$*OOH + H^+ + e^- \rightleftharpoons *O + H_2O$$
 (8)

$$*O + H^+ + e^- \rightleftharpoons *OH$$
 (9)

$$^*OH + H^+ + e^- \rightleftharpoons ^* + H_2O$$
 (10)

According to the CHE model, the theoretical limiting potential ( $U_{\rm L}$ ) is calculated by the minimum free energy change ( $\Delta G_{\rm min}$ ) among the four electrochemical steps as  $U_{\rm L} = -\Delta G_{\rm min}/$  e.<sup>[68,70]</sup> The adsorption energies of different intermediates were calculated by calculated by using Equations (11)–(13):

$$\Delta G_{*OOH} = G_{*OOH} + 1/2G_{H_2} - G_* - 2G_{H_2O}$$
 (11)

$$\Delta G_{*0} = G_{*0} + G_{H_2} - G_* - G_{H_2O} \tag{12}$$

$$\Delta G_{*OH} = G^*OH + 1/2G_{H_2} - E_* - G_{H_2O}$$
 (13)

Solvation energies were calculated by using the implicit solvation model as implemented in VASPsol<sup>[82]</sup>. The dielectric constant was set to 78.4 for the  $\rm H_2O$  solvent. For the microkinetic simulations, please refer to the Supporting Information for more details.

**Abstract:** The atom-cluster interaction has recently been exploited as an effective way to increase the performance of metal-nitrogen-carbon catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, the rational design of such catalysts and understanding their structureproperty correlations remain a great challenge. Herein, we demonstrate that the introduction of adjacent metal (M) N4 single atoms (SAs) could significantly improve the ORR performance of a well-screened Fe atomic cluster (AC) catalyst by combining density functional theory (DFT) calculations and experimental analysis. The DFT studies suggest that the Cu N4 SAs act as a modulator to assist the O2 adsorption and cleavage of O O bond on the Fe AC active center, as well as optimize the release of OH\* intermediates to accelerate the whole ORR kinetic. The depositing of Fe AC with Cu N4 SAs on nitrogen doped mesoporous carbon nanosheet are then constructed through a universal interfacial monomicelles assembly strategy. Consistent with theoretical predictions, the resultant catalyst exhibits an outstanding ORR performance with a half-wave potential of 0.92 eV in alkali and 0.80 eV in acid, as well as a high power density of 214.8 mWcm <sup>2</sup> in zinc air battery. This work provides a novel strategy for precisely tuning the atomically dispersed poly-metallic centers for electrocatalysis.

### *Introduction*

Zinc air batteries (ZABs) are expected to be applied in the field of large-scale energy storage due to their advantages of a large theoretical energy density (up to 1086 Whkg <sup>1</sup> ), environmental friendliness, and high safety.[1] However, the complex four electron-proton coupling process of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at the cathode side usually leads to a slow reaction kinetic and a high overpotential of the system, seriously hindering its commercial application.[2] Therefore, numerous researchers have been committing to develop various catalysts (alloys,[3] doping,[4] and composites,[5] etc.) to improve the ORR reaction rate. Among them, Pt based precious metal catalysts have shown excellent ORR performances, but their high price and unsatisfying stability have driven tremendous efforts to explore novel electrocatalysts with low cost, high efficiency, and high stability.[6] At present, metal-nitrogen-carbon (M N C, M=Fe, Co, Mn) single atom (SA) catalysts are considered as the most ideal alternative to Pt based catalysts owing to their high atomic utilization efficiency, tunable electronic structure and extremely low production costs.[7] Particularly, Fe N C has been demonstrated as the most active component among M N C materials.[8] However, recent studies have found that the superoxide adsorption mode (two oxygen atoms coordinate with one metal atom) of O2 at single atomic site limits the dissociation of O O bonds, which is not conducive to its direct four electron transfer process.

To this end, atomic cluster (AC) catalysts containing dual/multi fully exposed atomic sites have recently received tremendous interest because they can effectively reduce the energy barrier of O O bonds by triggering the peroxide adsorption mode (each oxygen atom coordinates with one metal atom) and achieve higher selectivity for four electron reduction pathways. More importantly, the outer electronic interactions, co-adsorption and synergistic reaction between group atomic sites could break the limitations of continuous and collective adsorption and activation of reactant/intermediates on SA catalysts, making the AC catalysts more promising in the field of energy storage and catalysis. For example, Wang et al. demonstrated that non-planar nest-like Fe2S2 cluster sites in N-doped carbon plane can provide more excellent ORR activity than a single atomic catalyst, which are benefitted from the peroxo-like oxygen adsorption configuration and favorable release of OH\* intermedi-

ate by introduction of S atom.[9] Although outstanding performance have been achieved with these AC catalysts, the intrinsic ORR activity is still limited compared with the commercial Pt/C catalyst. Therefore, numerous strategies have been developed, including modulating the coordination environments,[10] introducing adjacent SA atoms,[11] adding bio-inspired axial additives,[12] and so on. Among these strategies, the introduction of adjacent SA atoms have been proposed as a promising way to synergistically boost the ORR activity and stability owing to the different electronic states between AC and SA. For instance, Liu et al. found that the unique coordination environment and strong electronic interaction between Mn N4 SA and FeMn AC sites exhibited an attractive ORR activity.[13] Wan and colleagues also reveal that the strong electronic interaction between the iron AC and satellite Fe N4 SA led to a superior ORR performance due to the unblocked electron transfer pathways and very short interacting distances.[8a] Since the nature of AC systems can be significantly altered by adding or removing just one hetero/homo atom, the rational design of such catalysts and gaining a deep understanding on the structure-property relations are of great importance yet remain a great challenge.

Here, we demonstrate the synergistic relationship between the co-existence of Fe AC and M N4 SA for improving the ORR performance by a combined density functional theory (DFT) calculation screening and an experimental proving strategy. The preliminary DFT studies predict that the adjacent Cu N4 SAs act as a modulator to assist the O2 adsorption and cleavage of O O bond on the Fe AC active center. We then verify this concept by coloading Fe AC and M N4 SAs (e.g., Cu, Co, Mn, Ni, and Zn) on a nitrogen doped mesoporous carbon nanosheet through a universal interfacial monomicelles assembly strategy, followed by a NH3 assisted carbonization process. The rationally designed catalysts were well characterized through various techniques and evaluated as an excellent ORR catalyst for ZAB. The further calculation results reveal that the Cu N4 SAs could modulate the rehybridization of 3*d* electronic orbitals of Fe AC with the O *p* orbitals of intermediates, thus optimizing the release of OH\* in the rate-determining step of ORR kinetic processes. This work offers a new strategy to improve the intrinsic activity of Fe N C catalyst from understanding the electronic structure via introduction of both AC and SA moieties.

#### *Results and Discussion*

Considering the peroxide adsorption configuration and continuous four-electron transfer pathway in ORR process, the cluster model containing total five iron atoms was constructed based on previous studies.[8a,14] Other than the number of the atoms, the geometric structure also plays an important role in affecting the ORR performance. Therefore, four types of cluster models with different arrangements of Fe atoms (Figure 1a) were screened. Based on the calculated formation (*E*f) and binding (*E*b) energies (Figure 1b), the model 1 (Fe5 N C) is more thermodynamically stable than the others and was therefore chosen for further simulations. Then, we introduced an adjacent secondary metal atom to tune the electronic structure of Fe5 N C cluster, thereby adjusting their ORR performance. Given that the low cost, high safety, and environmental friendliness of the secondary metal required, we selected five transition metals (M), including Co, Cu, Ni, Mn and Zn. The corresponding models were constructed on Fe5 N C structure with adjacent M N4 moieties, in which the metal center was surrounded with four pyridine N atoms (defined as Fe5 M N C, Figure S1). The calculated *E*<sup>f</sup> values for all structures are negative (Figure S2), indicating that they are thermodynamically stable for the catalytic applications. It is well known that the adsorption of O2 and the stretching of O O bond are the key parameters that determine the performance of ORR.[15] Therefore, we calculated the O2 adsorption energy at different sites on the Fe5 M N C model. The O2 adsorption energy (Figure 1c) and O O bond elongation (Figure S3) were clearly improved with the introduction of adjacent SAs on the Fe5 N C cluster. The adsorption energy at Fe site is larger than those at M site, revealing that the Fe site is the active center while the M site acts as the modulator. Particularly, Fe5 Cu N C catalyst exhibits the highest degree of O O bond elongation compared with other SA modified, suggesting that the adjacent Cu N4 moiety may be the best candidate. To further identify the effect of M N4 moiety on the ORR performance of Fe5 N C, the mechanism associated with the 4e transfer pathway was further considered in the DFT calculations. Figure S4–6 displayed the adsorption configurations of reaction intermediate products (e.g., OOH\*, O\*, and OH\*, \* denotes the adsorption site) on the models. Then, we plotted the Gibbs free energy (ΔG) diagrams of the intermediates (Figure 1d) with respective to their cell potentials. Consistent with the previous DFT calculation, the rate limiting step is the formation of H2O from OH\* with an energy barrier of 1.65 eV on pristine Fe5 N C catalyst at the potential of U=1.23 V.[16] Encouragingly, the potential of the OH\*!H2O step sharply reduced to 1.06 eV for the configuration of Fe5 Cu N C, suggesting that the introduction of Cu N4 moieties facilitate the release of OH\*. When switch the potential of U to 0 V, the energy barrier from OOH\* to H2O2 for all models are negative except for Fe5 Zn N C structure, indicating that the introduction of adjacent single atoms can facilitate the 4e ORR process. Correspondingly, a reduction in the required overpotential were observed compared to pure Fe5 N C sample at the final OH\*!H2O step, suggesting that these single atoms can also improve the catalytic performance of the Fe5 N C catalyst. More importantly, the OH\*!H2O step was downhill in the presence of Cu N4 structure (Figure S7), further proving the priority of the Fe5 Cu N C configuration.

Guided by the DFT results above, we designed a twodimensional (2D) nitrogen-doped mesoporous carbon framework that can simultaneously anchor Fe ACs and adjacent M N4 SA through an interfacial monomicelles assembly strategy, followed by a post-carbonization process in NH3 atmosphere (See the details in Experimental

Section). The utilization of 2D mesoporous nanosheet as the support not only provides a spatial confinement effect to obtain the desired cluster and atom interacted structure during the carbonization process but also reduce the influence of O2 diffusion process on the following ORR application. To create large ordered mesopores, a lab-made diblock copolymer poly(ethylene oxide)-block-polystyrene (PEO-*b*-PS) was first prepared as the pore-forming agent through an atom transfer radical polymerization method. The copolymer possesses a very high quality, as suggested by the narrow molecular weight distribution in gel permeation chromatography result (Figure S8) and the uniform particles size distribution of PEO-*b*-PS monomicelles from transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observation (Figure S9). Dopamine (DA) was used as the carbon source because it possesses abundant amino and phenolic hydroxyl groups, which can easily form metal complexes with the metal ions (e.g. Fe3<sup>+</sup>, Cu<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup>, Co<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup>, etc) and then interact with PEO-*b*-PS to form PEO-*b*-PS/M-DA composite monomicelles.[17] To give an example, the scanning TEM (STEM) image of the PEO-*b*-PS/Fe Cu DA composite monomicelles displays regular spherical structure, and the energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) element mapping analysis shows a uniform distribution of nitrogen and metal, confirming the successful formation of PEO-*b*-PS/ Fe Cu DA composite monomicelles (Figure S10). Then, the interfacial monomicelles assembly process was carried out by assembling the composite monomicelles on graphene oxide (GO). Owing to the presence of large amount of OH and COOH functional groups, the composite monomicelles can be deposited on the surface of GO by electrostatic interaction. Subsequently, the slight adjustment of the solution pH induced the gradual crosslinking of DA to from well-defined mesoscopic polydopamine (PDA)-metal skeleton, as can be clearly observed from the TEM images at different reaction times (Figure S11). The uniform distribution of N, O, Fe, and Cu elements in the collected as-made sample through centrifugation also confirms the formation of PDA-metal organic–inorganic skeleton (Figure S12). Finally, the Fe ACs and adjacent metal SAs decorated nitrogen-doped mesoporous carbon (Fe5 M N mC) materials with a thickness of approximately 8 nm (Figure S13) were obtained after the pyrolysis of the organic–inorganic skeleton in NH3 atmosphere at 700 °C. Note that the addition amount of metal salts and calcination temperature were optimized for obtaining the desired structure that matches with the DFT calculated results (Figure S14–17, Table S1). As a comparison, the supporting of Fe ACs and Cu SAs on a nonporous carbon framework was also synthesized (Figure S18).

To examine the structural properties of the resultant materials, a series of characterizations were carried out (mainly taking Fe5 Cu N mC as the example). The comparison samples including the nitrogen doped mesoporous

carbon (N mC), Fe AC decorated nitrogen doped mesoporous carbon (Fe5 N mC) and Cu SA decorated nitrogen doped mesoporous carbon (Cu N mC) were also synthesized and characterized (Figure S19–21). The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of all N mC related samples exhibit a broad peak at 25°, corresponding to the (002) diffraction plane of graphite (Figure 2a).[18] No diffraction peak belonging to metal-based nanoparticles was obtained in the XRD patterns of Fe5 N mC, Cu N mC and Fe5 Cu N mC samples, implying the possible formation of SAs and small ACs. Both the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and TEM images show that the Fe5 Cu N mC sample possess two layers of nanosheet structure with uniform spherical mesopores (�23 nm) (Figure 2b, c). In addition, no large aggregate was observed in the dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy images (STEM, Figure 2d), matching well with the XRD results. To further characterize the atomic structure of the Fe5 Cu N mC sample, spherical-aberration-corrected high-angle annular STEM (AC HAADF-STEM) experiments were also proceeded. It is clearly seen the accumulation of some metal atoms visible through bright spots (Figure 2e). The magnified STEM images also reveal that both SAs (yellow circles) and ACs (red circles) exist on the carbon substrate, and the SAs tend to surround the ACs (Figure 2f). The line scanning analysis profiles of the selected spot also suggest that the Cu SAs were dispersed around the Fe ACs, demonstrating the successful construction of SA and AC interacted structure in Fe5 Cu N mC sample (Figure 2g–h and Figure S22). Atomic resolution EDS mappings of Fe5 Cu N mC further confirms that the Fe element exist in a state of ACs surrounded by discrete Cu atoms (Figure 2i–j). Based on the statistical analysis of several AC HAADF-STEM images, we estimate that the ACs possess an average size of

The N2 sorption isotherms of all catalysts possess a typical type-IV sorption isotherm, further suggesting the presence of large mesopores.[19] The BET surface areas were calculated to be 305.0, 349.1, 457.9, and 499.6 m2 g <sup>1</sup> for Fe5 Cu N mC, Fe5 N mC, Cu N mC, and N mC samples, respectively (Figure S24a). The decrease in the BET surface area with the incorporation of metal moieties can be attributed to the occupation of micropores by the ACs or SAs, as suggested by the shifting of microporous peak to larger in the pore size distribution analysis (Figure S24b). In addition, a mesoporous peak centered at �23 nm was detected for all the N mC related samples, consistent with the SEM and TEM observations, which is conducive to the ORR performance. Raman spectrum of Fe5 Cu N mC exhibits a reduced peak intensities ratio of D band (1340 cm <sup>1</sup> ) to G band (1590 cm <sup>1</sup> ) (Figure S25), indicating an increased graphitization in its structure, which is possibly to the catalytic effect of metal atoms during carbonization process.[20] The highly graphitic carbon may increase the electron conduction and corrosion resistance of the substrate, thus improving the ORR performance of the catalyst. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was further utilized to characterize the surface composition and elemental state of the resultant catalysts. The high-resolution C1s spectrum of the synthesized catalysts were fitted using three peaks representing to C=O, C N/C=N, and C=C (Figure S26).[13] The high-resolution N 1s spectrum of Fe5 Cu N mC, Fe5 N mC and Cu N mC can be resolved into distinct peaks corresponding to different nitrogen species, namely pyridinic-N (398.7 eV), metal-N (M N, 399.2 eV), oxidized-N (403.2 eV), and graphitic-N (401.0 eV) (Figure S27a).[21] The addition of metals may affect the transfer and redistribution of electrons, resulting in changes in the electronic state of pyrrole N and subsequently affecting the signal of pyrrole N.[8a,13,22] The appearance of metal-N peak suggests the strong interaction between the metal atoms and mesoporous support, which is important for maintaining a high stability during ORR process. Previous studies have shown that pyridinic-N and graphitic-N possess strong electrondonating abilities, which can accelerate electron transfer, and consequently enhance the ORR kinetics of the catalyst.[23] Therefore, the content of nitrogen in all resultant catalysts were calculated according to the XPS data (Figure S27b and table S3). The contents of pyridinic-N and graphitic-N in Fe5 Cu N mC sample are significantly higher than those of Cu N mC, Fe5 N mC and N mC samples. In the high-resolution Fe 2p spectrum of XPS, two prominent peaks at 711.0 and 724.6 eV attributed to Fe 2p3/2 and Fe 2p1/2 were observed (Figure S28a).[24] Compared to Fe5 N mC sample, the Fe 2p1/2 peak in Fe5 Cu N mC shifted negatively by 0.5 eV, indicating an increase in the electron density of Fe ACs after the incorporation of Cu SAs. The high-resolution of Cu 2p spectrum in Fe5 Cu N mC and Cu N mC samples (Figure S28b) displays two weak peaks at 932.3 eV for Cu 2p3/2 and 952.4 eV for Cu 2p1/2, respectively, indicating the presence of Cu<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> species possibly in a state of Cu N bonds.

formed (WT) EXAFS, a powerful tool to distinguish the backscattering atoms, exhibits an intensity maximum at

scattering path (Figure 3g). In the Cu K-edge XANES spectra (Figure 3d), the adsorption edge of Cu in Fe5 Cu N mC sample is close to CuO, revealing that the valence state of Cu is positive and close to +2. The Cu Kedge FT-EXAFS spectra of Fe5 Cu N mC (Figure 3e) shows a prominent peak at 1.47 Å, close to the Cu N peak of CuPc reference (1.45 Å). The lack of prominent metallic peaks corresponding to Cu Cu and Cu O Cu coordination in Fe5 Cu N mC indicates that the Cu species are present in an atomically dispersed form. According to EXAFS fitting results (Figure 3f and Figure S29b), the coordination number of Cu N is 3.8 (Table S4). The WT-EXAFS analysis (Figure 3g) shows a maximum intensity at �5.8 Å <sup>1</sup>

Note that this strategy is facile and universal, which can be applied for the generation of various other AC and SA interacted (Fe5 Co, Fe5 Ni, Fe5 Mn, and Fe5 Zn,) nitrogen-doped mesoporous carbon catalyst. Similar to the result of Fe5 Cu N mC sample, no diffraction peaks of metal nanoparticles were detected in their XRD patterns (Figure S30). The corresponding SEM, TEM, EDS mapping, and AC HAADF-STEM images also show the similar morphology, element distribution and atomic structure to those of Fe5 Cu N mC (Figure S31–34 and table S1). The XANES and EXAFS spectra of Fe5 Co N mC and Fe5 Ni N mC samples display that the iron atoms accumulate in the form of Fe5 N4 AC structure and the adjacent metal SA exist as the M N4 coordination structure (Figure S35). More importantly, this interfacial monomicelles assembly strategy can also be extended to grow the ACs and SAs interacted structure on different interfaces such as

sponding to the Cu N scattering. Overall, the above characterizations prove that the Fe atoms and Cu atoms exist as AC and SA structure, respectively, which were stabilized by the nitrogen atoms in the carbon support.

carbon nanotubes, carbon black, and WO3 (Figure S36–39), demonstrating the great university of this approach.

The ORR activity of these electrocatalysts were then evaluated with a three-electrode system in O2-saturated KOH solution (0.1 M) (Figure 4 and Figure S40–41). The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves (Figure 4a, c) show that the Fe5 Cu N mC catalyst exhibits the highest ORR activity with a large half-wave potential (*E*1/2) of 0.92 V (vs. RHE) and a high kinetic current density (*J*k) of 30.92 mAcm <sup>2</sup> at 0.85 V (vs. RHE) compared with other adjacent metal SA decorated iron cluster catalysts, matching well with the DFT results. Meanwhile, Fe5 N mC and Cu N mC catalysts demonstrated significantly lower *E*1/2 values of 0.83 and 0.80 V (Figure 4b), respectively, indicating the importance to construct AC and SA interacted structure. More importantly, the Fe5 Cu N mC is one of the best Fe based cluster catalysts in alkaline conditions among previously reported catalysts (Table S5). We further examine the specific activity-potential relationship using Tafel plots. The smaller Tafel slope of Fe5 Cu N mC (55.3 mVdec <sup>1</sup> ) than those of Fe5 N mC (103.7 mVdec <sup>1</sup> ), Cu N mC (78.9 mVdec <sup>1</sup> ), Pt/C (100.1 mVdec <sup>1</sup> ) and N mC (112.6 mVdec <sup>1</sup> ) further confirm the superior ORR kinetics of Fe5 Cu N mC catalyst (Figure 4c). The rotating disk electrode (RDE) was used to test the ORR pathways of the resultant catalysts at different rotation rates (Figure 4d, e and Figure S42). The Koutecky–Levich (K L) plots suggest that the catalysts under investigation exhibit a first-order reaction kinetic and the electron transfer number (n) of Fe5 Cu N mC is determined to be 3.90–3.97 (Figure 4d–e), confirming a near 4e ORR pathway.[26] The rotating ringdisk electrode (RRDE) measurements (Figure 4f and Figures S43) demonstrate that the H2O2 yield of Fe5 Cu N mC is below 2% over the potential range from 0.2 V to 0.8 V, further proving the 4e ORR pathway. The electrochemical active specific surface area (ECSA) is determined by measuring the double-layer capacitance (*C*dl) of catalysts, which serves as a valuable parameter for assessing the surface characteristics of catalysts in an electrolyte environment. The calculated *C*dl of Fe5 Cu N mC is 8.98 mFcm <sup>2</sup> , surpassing those values of Pt/C (7.73 mFcm <sup>2</sup> ), Fe5 N mC (4.30 mFcm <sup>2</sup> ), Cu N mC (2.32 mFcm <sup>2</sup> ), and N mC (1.32 mFcm <sup>2</sup> ) (Figure 4g and Figure S44). The higher *C*dl value indicates that the Fe5 Cu N mC catalyst possesses higher active sites density on its surface, thus leading to faster ORR kinetics.[27] In addition, the ECSA-normalized *J*<sup>k</sup>

of the kinetic control region of the resultant catalysts (Figure 4h) show that Fe5 Cu N mC catalyst exhibits the highest slope among all prepared catalysts, further proving that such as catalyst possesses the highest ORR catalytic activity. In order to assess the crucial function of the isolated Fe sites in enhancing ORR activity, we conducted KSCN poisoning experiments. The Fe5 Cu N mC (Figure S45) displayed a reduction of approximately �38 mV in *E*1/2 upon the addition of KSCN solution, reinforcing the significance of these Fe and Cu sites in facilitating ORR.[28] The stability of the catalyst plays a very important role in practical applications. The chronoamperometry measurement and methanol tolerance was used to evaluate the durability of Fe5 Cu N mC. After continuous operation for 40000 s, Fe5 Cu N mC maintained 98.4% of its initial current density, while Pt/C only remained at 77.6% (Figure 4i). After the durability test, the morphology and structure of Fe5 Cu N mC did not change (Figure S46). In addition, we conducted ICP-OES and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) tests on the sample after the durability test. It was observed that there was no clear change in the oxidation states and content of metals (Figure S47 and Tale S2). Meanwhile, The AC HAADF-STEM images showed that most clusters and single atoms were well maintained after the recycle (Figure S48). All these results suggested that Fe5 Cu N mC maintained an excellent stability. After the addition of 1 ml of methanol, there was no significant change in the current density of Fe5 Cu N mC, while the current density of Pt/C decreased significantly after the injection of methanol (Figure S49), indicating that Fe5 Cu N mC has an excellent methanol tolerance.

The ORR activities of the resultant catalysts were also evaluated in O2-saturated H2SO4 solution (0.5 M) (Figure S50–51). Compared with Fe5 N mC, Cu N mC and N mC, Fe5 Cu N mC catalyst exhibits the best ORR performance with the *E*1/2 of 0.80 V (vs. RHE) and the *J*<sup>k</sup> of 6.12 mAcm <sup>2</sup> at 0.7 V (vs. RHE) (Figure S51a, b). The resultant Fe5 Cu N mC catalyst exhibits the lowest Tafel slope, further indicating its superior ORR kinetic (Figure S51c). The calculated *C*dl of Fe5 Cu N mC reveals a higher value of 25.8 mFcm <sup>2</sup> (Figure S52), being related to it higher surface accessibility of active sites. Both the K L equation (Figure S51d, e) and RRDE measurements (Figure S53–54) verify the complete 4e ORR pathway of Fe5 Cu N mC catalyst. Importantly, Fe5 Cu N mC demonstrates a remarkable stability with a current retention of

�94.3% after 40000 s, while for Pt/C only 82.8% remain (Figure S51f). All these results suggest that the Fe5 Cu N mC catalyst is also an excellent ORR catalyst in acidic condition. It is worth mentioning that the Fe5 Cu N mC is one of the best Fe based cluster catalysts in acidic conditions among previously reported catalysts (Table S6).

To elucidate the role of Cu N4 SA in Fe5 Cu N mC catalyst, the DFT calculations on the charge change and dorbitals of the Fe ACs before and after the introduction of Cu N4 SA were further performed and compared (Figure 5a and Figure S55–57). First, the differential charge density distribution and Bader charge analysis reveal that the incorporation of Cu SAs induce significant electronic rearrangement within the active sites of Fe AC (Figure 5a). More electrons (1.03 e ) were transferred from the iron atom to the \*OH. As a result, the iron atom exhibit an enhanced electronegativity, which explains the favorable release of OH\* in ΔG diagrams (Figure 1d). Figure 5b illustrates the impact of adsorbed OH ligands on the electronic structure of Fe with different single atoms. Specifically, the d-band center energy of Fe5 Cu N mC increases from 1.70 eV to 1.31 eV. Compared to other M N4 atoms, Fe5 Cu N mC OH exhibits an elevated dband center energy, suggesting that the incorporation of Cu N4 SAs optimized the adsorption of OH\* in Fe5 Cu N mC catalyst. More importantly, the changes in the *d*-orbital states of Fe AC before and after Cu SAs doping were investigated through the analysis of projected density of states (PDOS). In the pristine Fe5 N mC catalyst, the high asymmetrical unfilled *d*-orbital energy levels for *d*xz and *d*yz orbitals were observed. However, after the incorporation of adjacent Cu N4 SA, a reduction of the *d*xz and *d*yz orbitals of Fe AC was found, which signifies the decrease in the magnetic moment in the projector-augmented-wave (PAW) sphere (Figures 5c, d), thus regulating the catalytic performance.[29] In addition, Fe5 Cu N mC exhibits a higher electron occupation near the Fermi level, leading to an enhanced conductivity and catalytic activity. Moreover, since OH\*!H2O is the rate-determining step in the ORR process, PDOS calculations were performed on the *d* orbitals of Fe and the *p* orbitals of O for Fe5 N mC and Fe5 Cu N mC before and after \*OH adsorption (Figure 5e–f). Clearly, followed by the Cu N4 moieties introducing, the Fe *dz*<sup>2</sup> orbital can undergo hybridization with the O *p*<sup>z</sup> orbital, resulting in the formation of a σ<sup>2</sup> bond. The σ<sup>2</sup> bond, formed in double bonds, exhibits a significantly faster reaction rate and higher stability in the ORR process compared to the weaker σ<sup>1</sup> bond formed in a single bond. In addition, the Fe *d*xy orbital is capable of forming a π1 bond with the O *p* orbital, while the Fe *d*xz/*d*yz orbitals hybridize with the O *p*x/*p*<sup>y</sup> orbitals, forming π\* antibonding orbitals with relatively weak energy splitting that are close to the Fermi energy level. These findings indicate a pronounced preference of a higher number of electrons to occupy the π\* antibonding orbitals, leading to a decrease in the adsorption strength of \*OH and thus promoting \*OH desorption for the formation of H2O.[11c] Collectively, these results highlight a substantial enhancement in the ORR performance of Fe5 Cu N mC through the incorporation of Cu SAs.

Based on the excellent catalytic performance of Fe5 Cu N mC, we assembled it to a home-made aqueous ZAB (Figure 6a). The Fe5 Cu N mC based ZAB possesses a larger open circuit voltage (1.48 V) than those of Pt/C (1.44 V) and Fe5 N mC (1.47 V) (Figure 6b). The discharge polarization curve and power density curves (Figure 6c) also

show that the Fe5 Cu N mC demonstrates the highest power density (214.8 mWcm <sup>2</sup> ) among all tested materials, significantly outperforming Fe5 N mC (198.8 mWcm <sup>2</sup> ) and Pt/C (144.9 mWcm <sup>2</sup> ). The specific capacity of Fe5 Cu N mC-based battery at 10 mAcm <sup>2</sup> is 819.46 mAhg <sup>1</sup> , larger than those of Fe5 N mC (791.74 mAhg <sup>1</sup> ) and Pt/C (745.23 mAhg <sup>1</sup> ) (Figure 6d). Importantly, compared with other catalysts reported recently, the Fe5 Cu N mC catalyst exhibits a relatively high peak power density and specific capacity (Figure 6e and Table S7). The constant current discharge processes at different current densities (5–50 mAcm <sup>2</sup> ) reveal that the voltage plateaus of Fe5 Cu N mC are consistently higher than those of Fe5 N mC and Pt/C catalyst (Figure 6f), suggesting an exceptional ORR stability and rate performance of the Fe5 Cu N mC based battery. Note that the slight difference of the voltage in the test of specific capacity and chronopotentiometric response is possibly due to the different utilization rates of the active material (such as zinc) caused by the dendrite growth during the charging/ discharging process. In addition, the Fe5 Cu N mC-based battery also displayed an excellent rechargeability and operational stability (Figure 6g). These results demonstrate that Fe5 Cu N mC is a promising electrocatalyst in ZABs application.

#### *Conclusion*

We theoretically and experimentally demonstrated that the adjacent Cu N4 SAs could significantly improve the ORR performance of the iron ACs on the nitrogen doped mesoporous carbon framework. Preliminary DFT calculations indicated that the adjacent Cu N4 could greatly enhance both the adsorption and cleavage of O2 through tuning the electronic structures of d-band center on iron cluster. As a result, the as-constructed Fe5 Cu N mC catalyst exhibited a large half-wave potential (0.92 V vs. RHE) and an excellent stability, surpassing both Fe5 N mC and commercial Pt/C catalysts by a considerable margin. The Zn-air battery powered by Fe5 Cu N mC catalyst demonstrated a superior power density (214.8 mWcm <sup>2</sup> ) and a high cycling stability, making it a compelling candidate for replacing commercial Pt/C-based systems. The more indepth DFT calculations on the charge density and projected density of states of the Fe5 Cu N mC catalyst suggest that the Cu N4 showed a positive modulation effect on the cluster sites. This work not only offers a new strategy to rationally modulate the electronic state of catalytic iron AC center by the introduction of adjacent hetero-metal atoms but also acts as a good example to develop more efficient

electrocatalyst for other energy-related catalysis through the combined theoretical calculation and experimental analysis.

Abstract: Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is the bottleneck of metal-air batteries and fuel cells. Strain regulation can change the geometry and adjust the surface charge distribution of catalysts, which is a powerful strategy to optimize the ORR activity. The introduction of controlled strain to the material is still difficult to achieve. Herein, we present a temperaturepressure-induced strategy to achieve the controlled lattice strain for metal coordination polymers. Through the systematic study of the strain effect on ORR performance, the relationship between geometric and electronic effects is further understood and confirmed. The strained Co-DABDT (DABDT=2,5-diaminobenzene-1,4-dithiol) with 2 % lattice compression exhibits a superior half-wave potential of 0.81 V. Theoretical analysis reveals that the lattice strain changes spincharge densities around S atoms for Co-DABDT, and then regulates the hydrogen bond interaction with intermediates to promote the ORR catalytic process. This work helps to understand the catalytic mechanism from the atomic level.

Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), involving metal-air batteries and fuel cells etc., is an important way to achieve global carbon neutrality. However, due to the complex four-electron process of ORR, its kinetic process is generally regarded as the bottleneck of the performance of metal-air batteries and fuel cells. Currently, the most effective commercial ORR catalyst is platinum-based materials, but the rareness limits their commercial applications. The ORR electrocatalysts with low overpotential and high-quality activity, as well as high durability to reduce cost are highly desirable.

Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have well-defined structures and abundant active metal sites, effectively combining the advantages of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts. [5] However, for traditional MOFs, the improvement of their electrochemical activity is severely inhibited by electrical insulators, which severely limits their wide application in electrocatalysis. [6] Recently, d- $\pi$  conjugated metal coordination framework has emerged as a new class of MOFs, which has the characteristics of in-plane  $\pi$  delocalization and weak out-of-plane  $\pi$  stacking, effectively improves the electron transfer capacity and still retains the inherent advantages of traditional MOFs. [7] As a result, the d- $\pi$  conjugated metal coordination framework provides an ideal model structure for studying the mechanism of ORR electrocatalysis.

Lattice strain could effectively induce and regulate the geometric and electronic structures, which is an important method to improve the ORR performance.[8] However, strain generation is usually uncontrollable. Due to the interactions between hosts and guests, as well as their enhanced flexibility compared to traditional inorganic materials, MOFs exhibit deformations in their crystal structures, making them excellent candidates for straininduced chemical detection. Currently, the regulation of MOFs mainly considers the coordination number, coordination atoms and axial guest groups of metal sites. However, the strain-induced regulation of MOFs is seldom explored, which is currently challenging and rarely discussed. [9] It is worth noting that the change of spatial structure caused by lattice strain would achieve micro-regulation of the electronic state of the catalysts, which might be an effective strategy to improve the catalytic activity of MOFs. Therefore, lattice-strained regulation of MOFs is a new field worth exploring in electrocatalysis research.

Herein, we successfully prepared d- $\pi$  conjugated Co-DABDT (DABDT=2,5-diaminobenzene-1,4-dithiol) with special N, S coordination properties. The Co-N<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub> acted as highly metal active centers for ORR process. Besides, through using the temperature difference-pressure characteristics of the solvent system, the lattice strain of Co-DABDT has been accurately regulated and further enhanced the ORR activity of Co-DABDT. The optimal lattice-strained Co-DABDT exhibits one of the most excellent ORR performances with a half-wave potential of 0.81 V. The influence of different degrees of lattice strain in the electronic structure and ORR performance of Co-DABDT was deeply illustrated through the theoretical calculations. The existence of lattice strain mainly affects the

spin charge density of sulfur in Co-DABDT (Figure 1a), thus optimizing the hydrogen bond interaction between intermediates and catalysts, ultimately leading to an enhanced ORR process. This provides a new perspective for understanding the structure–activity relationship of metal coordination frameworks in electrocatalytic process.

Taking the novel d-π conjugated Co-DABDT (Co-N2S2) as a model catalyst, we fine-tuned the lattice strain and analyzed the effect of strain effect on ORR electrocatalytic performance. Co-DABDT was successfully synthesized by complexation reaction under different temperatures. The pressure of the reaction system varied with the reaction temperature and different lattice strains were introduced into the Co-DABDT. The morphology and microstructure of Co-DABDT synthesized at different temperatures were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As shown in Figure S1, the Co-DABDT powder is composed of numerous stacked nanorods. To further analyze the microscopic morphology of nanorods, it can be seen from TEM in Figure 1b-e that all Co-DABDT samples are uniform rectangular nanocrystalline structures with length and width of ca. 70 nm and 10 nm, respectively. Different temperature has little effect on morphology. According to the HRTEM (Figure 1b-e), the fringe lattice parameter of Co-DABDT obtained at 50 °C is 5.89 Å, which can be assigned to (100) crystal planes of pristine Co-DABDT as reported. Notably, as the temperature of the reaction system increasing to 70, 120 and 180 °C, the (100) crystal planes are compressed into 5.77 Å, 5.69 Å and 5.64 Å, which correspond to lattice compression ratios of 2.0%, 3.4% and 4.2% (denoted as Co-DABDT-2.0%, Co-DABDT-3.4% and Co-DABDT-4.2%), respectively. In addition, energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) mappings (Figure S2–5) confirm the presence of Co, N and S evenly distributed over Co-DABDT.

The powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) is an important characterization method to study material strain. The results of PXRD further demonstrate the existence of strain effects in Co-DABDT. According to the PXRD patterns of pristine Co-DABDT in Figure 2a, the sharp characteristic peaks located at 11.24, 15.20, and 17.74° are ascribed to (001), (100), and ( 101) planes, respectively, indicating highly crystalline structure. The characteristic diffraction peaks of both the pristine and lattice-strained Co-DABDT align with the theoretical XRD simulation, confirming the synthesis of a highly crystalline Co-DABDT. All characteristic diffraction peaks are in good agreement with the reported results.[10] The (100) plane significantly shifted the diffraction angles up to 15.52,15.76 and 15.84°as shown in Figure 2b, which is also significant evidence for the compressive lattice strain of Co-DABDT. The reason for the result might be that as the temperature of the system increases, the environmental pressure of the system increases, which leads to the

compression of Co-DABDT skeleton along the [100] direction (Figure 2c).

Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) was used to verify the evolution of bonding characteristics of Co-DABDT. Comparing the structural changes before and after the reaction by FTIR spectrum (Figure 2d**)**, for the DABDT, the S H stretching vibration is located at 2500 cm <sup>1</sup> , and the C N and C S stretching vibrations appear at 1183 and 1038 cm <sup>1</sup> , [10,11] respectively. After the reaction, the S H stretching vibration disappears and N H stretching vibration ( NH) appeared at 3198 cm <sup>1</sup> , [12] indicating the SH and NH2 from DABDT ligands have successfully coordinated with Co ions to form Co-DABDT. More accurate coordination environment information was further analyzed by X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). According to the extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectrum of Co-DABDT, Co-DABDT-2.0%, Co-DABDT-3.4% and Co-DABDT-4.2% (Figure 2e), two main peaks at ca. 1.4 and 1.8 Å are assigned to the Co N and Co S scattering paths,[13] and the absence of metal Co Co scattering indicates that Co atoms are in stable form of Co N S. As presented in Table S1 and Figure S6, the Co N and Co S coordination numbers for all Co-DABDT samples obtained by EXAFS fitting are close to 2, respectively. It further proves that we have prepared the d-π conjugated Co-DABDT model catalysts. The bond length statistics of Co N and Co S bonds are shown in Figure 2f, with the increase of compressive strain, both the bond length decreases continuously in a small amount. It proves that the introduction of compressive strain can not only reduce the spacing between adjacent chains, but also affect the bond length. The valence state of Co metal centers was analyzed by X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectra and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) in Figure 2g and 2 h. According to the XANES, the spectral line position of Co-DABDT is close to that of CoO, indicating that the Co<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> metal centers, and among Co-DABDT-2.0%, Co-DABDT-3.4% and Co-DABDT-4.2%, with the increase of compressive strain, the valence state of Co metal moves to low state, demonstrating that the change of spatial structure can effectively regulate the electronic structure of the active center of catalyst. In the high-resolution Co 2p spectrum (Figure 2h), the peak of Co-DABDT in Co 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 are located at 780.3 and 795.5 eV,[14] respectively, confirming 15213757, 2024, 16, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ange.202319518 by University Of Science, Wiley Online Library on [06/01/2026].

that Co exists in the form of 2+. As the compressive strain increases, the binding energy of Co<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> shifts to a lower binding energy. It indicates that the valence state of Co decreases, which is consistent with the XANES results. In the N 1s spectrum of Co-DABDT (Figure S7), there were two types of N peaks including ~399.8 eV belonging to C N single bond and ~398.3 eV belonging to C=N double bond,[15] resulting from the d-π conjugation effect. The S 2p peak of Co-DABDT could be deconvolved into three sets of doublet peaks (Figure S8). The peaks located at ~162.2 and 164.0 eV were attributed to S Co bond which further indicated the effective complexation between the thiol group and Co centers.[10] The survey spectrum (Figure S9) reveals the existence of all elements of Co, S, N, C, and O without any residual counter ions (NH4<sup>+</sup> or Cl ), proving that Co-DABDT is electrically neutral. The results of elemental analysis (EA) showed that the contents of C, N, and H for all as-prepared catalysts are close to theoretical value (Table S2). Thermogravimetric analysis (TG) was performed to analyze the stability of the strained Co-DABDT under Ar atmosphere from 30 to 600 °C (Figure 2i). All TG curves of different strained Co-DABDT showed a decreasing tendency after 200 °C, indicating the polymer began to decompose. Compared to the strained Co-DABDT, the curve of pristine Co-DABDT declined faster, suggesting that the introduction of compressive strain is conducive to enhancing the interaction between catalyst chains, to enhance the stability. Because the morphologies of the asprepared samples are all nanorods, their specific surface areas as estimated by low-pressure nitrogen adsorption isotherms (Figure S10) and Co-DABDT, Co-DABDT-2.0%, Co-DABDT-3.4% and Co-DABDT-4.2% show similar surface areas of 83.0, 73.1, 67.2 and 61.0 m<sup>2</sup> g <sup>1</sup> , respectively.

In order to further explore the internal relationship between lattice strain and ORR catalytic activity, the ORR properties of synthesized Co-DABDT in O2 saturated 0.1 M KOH solution were evaluated by using a rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE). The linear sweep voltammetry was first used to estimate the catalytic activity. When the electrode rotating rate was 1600 rounds per minute (rpm) and scanning speed was 5 mVs <sup>1</sup> in Figure 3a, the onset potential (Eonset) is 0.88 V, 0.96 V, 0.94 V and 0.87 V for Co-DABDT, Co-DABDT-2.0%, Co-DABDT-3.4% and Co-DABDT-4.2%, respectively, indicating that Co-DABDT-2.0% has a better electrocatalytic activity for ORR reaction. The halfwave potential (*E*1/2) of Co-DABD-2.0% is 0.81 V, which is 20 mV, 10 mV and 42 mV more positive than that of Co-DABDT, Co-DABDT-3.4% and Co-DABDT-4.2%, respectively. It can be found that with the increase of the compressive strain, the catalytic activities are first improved and then reach the optimum (Co-DABD-2.0%), and further enhancing the compressive strain leads to the deterioration of the ORR performance. According to the polarization curve, the number of electron transfers and hydrogen peroxide yield in the electrocatalytic ORR process can be calculated (Figure 3b). The average electron transfer numbers of Co-DABDT, Co-DABDT-2.0%, Co-DABDT-3.4% and Co-DABDT-4.2% are about 3.81, 3.85, 3.61 and 3.54 in

the potential range of 0.3–0.8 V according to the current of the ring and disk (Figure 3c). All the as-prepared catalysts have an obvious quasi-4e ORR process. Among them, Co-DABD-2.0% is more prone to four-electron reaction than Co-DABDT, Co-DABDT-3.4% and Co-DABDT-4.2%. Therefore, the introduction of compressive stress can effectively affect the ORR activity of the Co-DABDT catalysts, and the experimental results show a "volcano" relationship between the activity and the lattice strain with the ORR activity peaking at a compressive lattice strain of 2.0%. Note that the electrocatalytic activity of Co-DABD-2.0% is comparable to that of reported state-of-the-art ORR catalysts based on non-noble metal coordination polymers (Table S3).

The LSV curves of Co-DABDT, Co-DABDT-2.0%, Co-DABDT-3.4% and Co-DABDT-4.2% at different speeds (400–1600 rpm, Figure S11). It can be observed that the curves have a good limiting current diffusion platform, and the current density increases with the enhancement of electrode speed due to the developed pore structure and abundant active sites of Co-DABDT. In order to further evaluate the exposure rate of the intrinsic active site of the catalyst, the electrochemical double-layer capacitances (Cdl) of Co-DABDT, Co-DABDT-2.0%, Co-DABDT-3.4% and Co-DABDT-4.2% were calculated as 1.89 mF, 2.40 mF, 2.13 mF and 2.17 mF in Figure 3d by double-layer capacitance curve test (Figure S12), respectively. Co-DABDT, Co-DABDT-2.0%, Co-DABDT-3.4% and Co-DABDT-4.2% 15213757, 2024, 16, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ange.202319518 by University Of Science, Wiley Online Library on [06/01/2026].

have similar specific surface areas, as a result, the difference in catalyst activity is more likely to be derived from intrinsic activity rather than the number of exposed active sites. The Cdl value further indicates that the change in catalytic activity is caused by the change in intrinsic strain of catalyst. The Tafel slopes were used to evaluate the ORR kinetics as shown in Figure 3e. The Tafel values of Co-DABDT-2.0% were 39 mVdec <sup>1</sup> , which was lower than those of the Co-DABDT, Co-DABDT-3.4% (51 mVdec <sup>1</sup> ) and Co-DABDT-4.2% (65 mVdec <sup>1</sup> ), the Tafel slope of Co-DABDT-2.0% indicates that it has the fastest reaction kinetics.[16] The electrochemical stability of lattice-strained Co-DABDT was studied by i-t curve. All lattice-strained Co- DABDT show negligible decrease in current density (Figure 3f), indicating lattice-strained Co-DABDT has good electrochemical stability. The Co-DABDT-2.0% was characterized by XRD and XPS after the i-t curve test. It can be seen from Figure S13a that Co-DABDT-2.0% can still maintain its crystal structure, and the valence state of Co metal centers in Co- DABDT-2.0% does not change significantly (Figure S13b). The lattice-strained Co-DABDT can maintain excellent structural stability in electrocatalytic ORR process. In addition, the tolerance to the crossover effect of ORR electrocatalysts is a primary consideration for practical applications in methanol fuel cells.[17] Co-DABDT-2.0% exhibits excellent methanol tolerance, while the current density of Pt/C decreases obviously with methanol added (Figure S14).

In order to understand the internal relationship among strain regulation electrocatalysis, the electronic properties of the electrocatalysts and ORR pathways (Figure 4a) were further analyzed by DFT calculations. Figure 4b shows the distribution of spin charge densities of Co-DABDT under different compression stress. It is found that spin charge densities around S atoms increase firstly and then decrease. Among these Co-DABDT catalysts, Co-DABDT-2% exhibits the highest spin charge density around S atoms. When OOH species are adsorbed on Co-DABDT-2% catalyst, there appears an intramolecular hydrogen bonding interaction between H atom of OOH and coordination S atom, as shown by charge density difference (Figure 4d). It is also found that the S atom of Co-DABDT-2% catalyst gains the most electrons after the adsorption of key intermediate OOH, suggesting a stronger electrostatic interaction between S and H atoms (Figure 4c). Therefore, Co-DABDT-2% catalyst tends to possess the stronger stabilization for key intermediate OOH. The free energy diagrams of ORR on Co-DABDT catalysts under different compression stress are shown in Figure 4e. Among these three catalysts, Co-DABDT-2% catalyst has the strongest adsorption strength for the key intermediate OOH. Since the potential determining step of ORR on Co-DABDT is the hydrogenation of O2 to \*OOH, Co-DABDT-2% exhibits the highest electrocatalytic activity towards ORR.

In conclusion, through developing a temperature-pressure-induced strategy, the different compressive-strained Co-DABDT structures were designed and precisely synthesized to investigate the correlation between the induced strain and ORR performance. The influence of strain on the

geometric and electronic properties of Co-DABDT has been proved. Electrochemical results confirm a "volcano" relationship between the activity and the lattice strain with the ORR activity peaking at a compressive lattice strain of 2.0%. The DFT calculation revealed that the strain-induced hydrogen bond interaction of sulfur atoms significantly optimized the adsorption of oxygen intermediates and enhanced the reaction kinetics of ORR. This work not only provides a new way to design efficient and low-cost oxygencatalyzing materials, but also opens up a new idea for the rational understanding and design of metal coordination framework catalysts, which further fills in and refines electrocatalytic regulation.

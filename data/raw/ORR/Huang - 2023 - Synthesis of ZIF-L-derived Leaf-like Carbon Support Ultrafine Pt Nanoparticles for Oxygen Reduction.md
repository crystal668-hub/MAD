**Abstract.** We prepared a two-dimensional ZIF-L-derived high-performance ORR catalyst using a mesoporous silica coating strategy. By one-step pyrolysis of mSiO2@L composite, the Pt precursors adsorbed inside ZIF-L are reduced to ultra-small Pt nanoparticles, and the SiO<sup>2</sup> template inhibits agglomeration and collapse of ZIF-L during pyrolysis. After the template is removed, the obtained Pt/SLC exhibits outstanding activity for ORR. The half-wave potential of Pt/SLC is 0.910 V vs. RHE, which far exceeds commercial Pt/C catalyst (0.895 V vs. RHE).

## **1. Introduction**

In order to accelerate the commercialization process of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), it is urgent to reduce the amount of Pt usage on the electrode while maintaining the high performance of the fuel cells [1]. Recent reports have shown that carbon support is crucial for the performance conversion of ORR from rotating disk electrode (RDE) to membrane electrode assembly (MEA) testing [2, 3]. MOFs are excellent self-sacrifice precursors for the preparation of functional carbon materials, which are expected to be used in ORR catalysts to improve the utilization of Pt and the transport performance of reactants at the three-phase interface, thereby improving the overall performance of PEMFCs [4] .

ZIF-L is one of the two-dimensional zeolite imidazole frameworks (ZIFs), which not only has the advantages of MOFs but also has the advantages of two-dimensional nanomaterials in structure and morphology [5]. In the structure of ZIF-L, the Zn2+ and 2-methylimidazole molecules coordinate to form a two-dimensional layer and hydrogen bonds are formed between the monolayers to maintain the interlayer structure due to the existence of uncoordinated 2-methylimidazole [6]. Benefiting from the unique orientation of monolayers in the ZIF-L structure, the active sites at the edge of its twodimensional structure are mostly exposed on the surface, making it a potential candidate for the preparation of catalysts [7]. Compared to three-dimensional MOFs, the thin layer and large outer surface of ZIF-L-derived carbon materials are beneficial to improve Pt utilization and shorten the mass transport distance in the electrocatalytic process.

Herein, we use ZIF-L as the precursor to prepare MOF-derived carbon and ORR catalyst. The strategy of mesoporous SiO2 coating ZIF-L is adopted to maintain the flake morphology of derived carbon (SLC). Ultra-small Pt nanoparticles (2.5 nm) were uniformly loaded into SLC, and the prepared Pt/SLC catalyst showed excellent performance in the RDE test. The half-wave potential of Pt/SLC can reach 0.910 V vs. RHE.

#### **2. Materials and synthesis**

### *2.1. Synthesis of two-dimensional ZIF-L*

Typically, Zn (NO3)2 and 2-methylimidazole were dissolved in 20 mL H2O in a molar ratio of 1:6 under stirring, respectively. Then, the metal salt solution was added to the ligand solution and reacted at room temperature for 4 h under stirring. The obtained precipitate was then centrifuged and replaced with H2O four times with an interval of 12 h each time.

#### *2.2. Synthesis of mSiO2@L*

1.0 g CTAB and 0.8 g 2-methylimidazole were dissolved in 100 mL H2O and 60 mL ethanol. Then, 500 mg ZIF-L was added and stirred until no bulk powders were observed. Then, 0.5 mL tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) was added to it and reacted for 2.5 h under stirring. The white products were centrifuged and replaced with ethanol three times at an interval of 6 h. The products were dried to obtain mSiO2@L.

#### *2.3. Synthesis of Pt/SLC*

500 mg of mSiO2@L and 30 mg of trimethyl(methylcyclopentadienyl)platinum (MeCpPtMe3) were mixed homogeneously and sealed in a Schlenk tube and then placed in a 60<sup>o</sup>C oven for 24 h. Then the products were heated for 2 h in Ar flow at 900<sup>o</sup>C. After calcination, the products were washed in HF to remove SiO2, and the Pt/SLC was obtained.

#### *2.4. Preparation of working electrode*

2.0 mg Pt/SLC were ultrasonically dispersed in a solution containing 170 μL ethanol/isopropanol (1:1) and 20 μL water for 20 min. Then 10 μL Nafion (5 wt. %) was added to prepare the catalyst ink by ultrasonication. The slurry was then dropped on clean, glassy carbon electrodes.

## *2.5. Electrochemical test*

ORR tests were performed and controlled by a rotating-ring disk electrode at a rate of 1600 rpm.

## **3. Results and discussions**

The PXRD result shows that the peaks of ZIF-L are consistent with the simulated ZIF-L (Figure 1). After coating ZIF-L with mesoporous silica, the obtained mSiO2@L composite has a diffraction peak at 2θ = 2<sup>o</sup> apart from the original ZIF-L diffraction peaks, which proves the successful coating of silica on ZIF-L.

Figure 1. PXRD patterns of simulated and as-synthesized ZIF-L and mSiO2@L.

We characterized the synthesized ZIF-L and mSiO2@L by SEM to explore their morphological characteristics. We found that the ZIF-L observed in SEM images was leaf-like with good dispersity

(Figure 2a), which is consistent with the previous report [8]. After coating ZIF-L with mesoporous silica, the obtained mSiO2@L composite maintained the original morphology of ZIF-L, and the thickness increased (Figure 2b).

Figure 2. SEM images of (a) ZIF-L and (b) mSiO2@L.

We introduced Pt precursors into ZIF-L and mSiO2@L and calcined them at 900<sup>o</sup>C to obtain derived catalysts. According to the SEM images, we observed that the template-free ZIF-L formed agglomerates up to 10 μm during pyrolysis, and the leaf-like morphology was not well maintained (Figure 3a). This is because the thin layer of ZIF-L was affected by internal stress during pyrolysis, resulting in agglomeration between the single sheet and the final morphology collapse. However, the catalyst prepared using mesoporous silica templates maintained the original ZIF-L flake morphology and had good dispersity, showing great potential for ORR (Figure 3b).

Figure 3. SEM images of (a) Pt/LC and (b) Pt/SLC.

According to the PXRD patterns, Pt/SLC manifested three broad peaks at 39.8°, 46.2°, and 67.5°, which are ascribed to Pt facets of (111), (200), and (220), respectively, confirming the precursors were reduced to Pt NPs during pyrolysis (Figure 4a). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of Pt/SLC showed that ultrafine Pt NPs (2.5 nm) were uniformly dispersed in the structure of Pt/SLC (Figure 4b).

We performed RDE tests on Pt/SLC and commercial Pt/C in 0.1 M HClO4 to test their ORR performance at the same Pt loading. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves (Figure 5) showed that Pt/SLC manifested more positive half-wave potential (E1/2 = 0.910 V *vs.* RHE) than commercial Pt/C (0.895 V *vs.* RHE), indicating excellent activity of Pt/SLC towards ORR.

#### **4. Conclusion**

In summary, we prepared a two-dimensional ZIF-L-derived high-performance ORR catalyst by coating ZIF-L with mesoporous silica, which effectively inhibits agglomeration and collapse of ZIF-L during pyrolysis. After the template is removed, the obtained Pt/SLC maintains the flake morphology and exhibits outstanding activity for ORR. The half-wave potential of Pt/SLC can reach 0.910 V vs. RHE. This work paves a new path for preparing well-designed, high-performance ORR catalysts for PEMFCs.

**Synthesis of highly efficient nonprecious metal electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) superior to platinum (Pt) is still a big challenge. Herein, a new highly active ORR electrocatalyst is reported based on graphene layers-wrapped Fe/Fe5C2 nanoparticles supported on N-doped graphene nanosheets (GL-Fe/Fe5C2/NG) through simply annealing a mixture of bulk graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) and ferrocene. An interesting exfoliation– denitrogen mechanism underlying the conversion of bulk g-C3N4 into N-doped graphene nanosheets is revealed. Owing to the high graphitic degree, optimum N-doping level and sufficient active sites from the graphene layerswrapped Fe/Fe5C2 nanoparticles, the as-prepared GL-Fe/Fe5C2/NG electrocatalyst obtained at 800 °C exhibits outstanding ORR activity with a 20 mV more positive half-wave potential than the commercial Pt/C catalyst in 0.1 m KOH solution and a comparable onset potential of 0.98 V. This makes GL-Fe/Fe5C2/ NG an outstanding electrocatalyst for ORR in alkaline solution.**

The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is an important process in various electrochemical energy technologies such as fuel cells and metal-–air batteries.[1–7] However, the sluggish ORR kinetics at the cathode greatly limits the practical application of these technologies.[8,9] Up to now, Pt-based catalysts are considered as the most efficient ORR electrocatalysts with more positive onset and half-wave potential.[10] Nevertheless, they suffer from high cost and scarcity, low stability, and also the issue of methanol crossover. Therefore, it is very desirable and urgent

metal catalysts (NPMCs) as alternatives to Pt-based electrocatalysts.

Recently, a variety of NPMCs including nanocarbons,[11–15] transition metal oxides,[16] carbides/nitrides, and their composites[17,18] with high activity and stability for ORR have been developed. Among these NPMCs, nanocarbons are considered as one class of promising ORR electrocatalysts due to their high stability,[19] and their ORR performances could be improved through doping of heteroatoms, such as N, S, B, and O.[20–23] In addition, nanocomposites of iron carbides and carbon (Fe3C/C) have also been reported to be highly active toward ORR and the graphitic layers activated by the encapsulated Fe3C nanoparticles have been regarded as the main active sites for ORR.[17,18,24–27] Currently, the phase of the

reported iron carbides catalyst is limited to Fe3C while other phases such as Fe5C2 are rarely explored as ORR electrocatalysts,[28] and the ORR performance of the reported Fe5C2-based catalyst including onset potential and half-wave potential still needs to be improved.[28] Despite these advances, the development of desired nanocarbon or iron carbide-based electrocatalysts with comparable or even superior performance to commercial Pt/C catalyst is still very challenging.

Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4), a metal-free semiconductor with a layered structure similar to graphite, has attracted intensive attention.[29,30] To obtain larger surface area and more active sites, bulk g-C3N4 is usually exfoliated into monolayer or few layers,[31] typically realized by thermal[31,32] or liquid exfoliation.[33,34] As liquid exfoliation always suffers from longterm sonication (10–16 h), thermal exfoliation turns out to be an appropriate choice to destack bulk g-C3N4. The mechanism of thermal exfoliation is to break hydrogen bonding in the NH2/NH groups between the polymeric melon unit layers, which is not so stable at high temperature (>500 °C) under air or H2 condition.[35] As a nitrogen-rich material, g-C3N4 has been also employed to synthesize N-doped carbon materials for ORR.[36–38] However, the ORR activity of these electrocatalysts is still inferior to that of commercial Pt/C.

Herein, we demonstrate a facile solid-state reaction method for the synthesis of graphene layers-wrapped Fe/Fe5C2 nanoparticles supported on N-doped graphene nanosheets (denoted as GL-Fe/Fe5C2/NG) simply using bulk g-C3N4 and ferrocene as the precursors, as depicted in **Figure 1**. During the reaction,

**Figure 1.** Schematic illustration of the formation of the GL-Fe/Fe5C2/NG electrocatalyst.

the bulk g-C3N4 is first exfoliated into nanosheets below 650 °C and then the exfoliated g-C3N4 nanosheets are transformed into N-doped graphene at temperature above 650 °C through a denitrogen reaction. At the same time, graphene layers-wrapped Fe/ Fe5C2 nanoparticles are in situ formed on the surface of graphene nanosheets. A series of samples obtained at different temperatures are denoted as GL-Fe/Fe5C2/NG-T (where *T* is the heating temperature). The as-prepared GL-Fe/Fe5C2/NG-800 catalyst possesses favorable characteristics for ORR, including catalytically active composition, porous structure, high specific surface area, optimum N-doping level, as well as high graphitic degree. As expected, the GL-Fe/Fe5C2/NG-800 catalyst exhibits ORR performance superior to commercial Pt/C with excellent electrocatalytic activity, stability, and methanol tolerance.

Compared to the bulk g-C3N4, the as-prepared GL-Fe/Fe5C2/ NG-800 sample is in a fluffy state (Figure S1, Supporting Information). The morphology and structure of GL-Fe/Fe5C2/ NG-800 are first examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements. As shown in **Figure 2**a, different from the solid block structure of bulk g-C3N4 (Figure S2, Supporting Information), the product is composed of loose and bushy nanosheets. The TEM images (Figure 2b,c) show that nanoparticles with a size of 20–50 nm are uniformly dispersed on the curved and folded nanosheets. Further high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) measurement (Figure 2d) reveals that these nanoparticles are well wrapped with a few graphene layers with a lattice distance of 0.34 nm, which matches well with the (002) plane of graphite carbon. HRTEM image in Figure 2d discloses that these nanoparticles are well crystallized with an interplanar spacing of 0.21 nm, corresponding to the (021) plane of Fe5C2 phase. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurement indicates the

existence of Fe, Fe5C2 as well as graphene in the GL-Fe/Fe5C2/ NG-800 sample (Figure S3, Supporting Information). The diffraction peak at 26.4° corresponds to the (002) plane of graphene, while the rest of diffraction peaks are from Fe5C2 species and α-Fe. The elemental mapping results demonstrate that nitrogen has been successfully doped into the carbon matrix (Figure 2f,g) and the Fe element signals (Figure 2h) mainly exist in the region of nanoparticles (white spots in Figure 2e). The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) survey spectrum of GL-Fe/Fe5C2/NG-800 reveals the existence of C (91.96%), N (3.98%), Fe (0.80%), and O (3.26%) elements (Figure S4, Supporting Information). The complex C 1s spectrum is deconvoluted into three main peaks (**Figure 3**a), corresponding to CC (284.5 eV), CN (285.5 eV), and CN (286.7 eV) bonds,[39] and the N 1s spectrum (Figure 3b) exhibits four types of nitrogen species, pyridinic N at 398.7 eV, graphitic N at 401.1 eV, pyrrolic N at 400.5 eV, and oxidized N at 403.4 eV.[40] The high-resolution Fe 2p spectra show the presence of peaks for Fe3+ (712.6 and 725.0 eV), Fe2<sup>+</sup> (710.3 and 723.1 eV), and Fe0 (706.8 eV), accompanied by a satellite peak (718.3 eV) (Figure S5, Supporting Information).[41,42] The presence of graphene is further verified by Raman scattering spectroscopy (Figure 3c). The ratio of D-band (*I*D) to G-band (*I*G) is 0.71, evidencing the formation of graphene.[43] The broad 2D peak at 2700 cm<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> implies that the sample is mainly composed of few-layered graphene rather than single-layered graphene.[44] Figure 3d shows the nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherm and pore size distribution of GL-Fe/Fe5C2/NG-800. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) specific surface area, pore volume, and average pore size of GL-Fe/Fe5C2/NG-800 are 856 m2 g−<sup>1</sup> , 2.48 cm3 g<sup>−</sup>1, and 3.5 nm, respectively. With such high BET specific surface area and pore volume, more active sites and more efficient transport of ORR relevant species can be expected.

The reaction mechanism of ferrocene with g-C3N4 is investigated by characterizing the samples obtained at different temperatures using XRD, SEM, Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), Raman, and XPS analyses. Compared to the bulk g-C3N4, the XRD pattern of GL-Fe/Fe5C2/NG-600 changes little with a slight shift of one peak from 27.3° to 27.7° (**Figure 4**a), indicating the dominance of g-C3N4 in GL-Fe/ Fe5C2/NG-600. The shift of the peak may come from the undulation of the lattice constant during the reaction. The morphology of GL-Fe/Fe5C2/NG-600 (Figure S6, Supporting Information) becomes looser than that of the pristine dense and solid g-C3N4, demonstrating the exfoliation of g-C3N4 at this temperature in the presence of ferrocene. The color of the pristine g-C3N4 is yellow while GL-Fe/Fe5C2/NG-600 is in dark gray color (Figure S1, Supporting Information). In the GL-Fe/Fe5C2/ NG-650 sample, the diffraction peaks of g-C3N4 disappear and new weak peaks related to carbon and Fe/Fe5C2 components at around 25.7°, 43°, and 45° appear (Figure 4a), suggesting the formation of graphitic carbon and Fe/Fe5C2 with low crystalline degree. As revealed by the SEM image (Figure S7, Supporting Information), the GL-Fe/Fe5C2/NG-650 sample consisting of nanosheets is quite shaggy and the color of the sample is black in a fluffy state (Figure S7b, Supporting Information), which is similar to the GL-Fe/Fe5C2/NG-800 sample. In the FT-IR spectra, the strong bands in the range of 1200–1650 cm−<sup>1</sup> (stretching modes of CN heterocycles) and the broad peaks in the range of 2988–3340 cm−<sup>1</sup> corresponding to the vibration www.advancedsciencenews.com

modes of -NH<sub>2</sub>/-NH groups are more prominent in the g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> sample. While for GL-Fe/Fe<sub>5</sub>C<sub>2</sub>/NG-600, these peaks become weaker, suggesting the loss of -NH<sub>2</sub>/-NH groups at the temperature of 600 °C. Only two main peaks located at about 1600 cm<sup>-1</sup> (C=N) and 1300 cm<sup>-1</sup> (C-N) are observed in GL-Fe/ Fe<sub>5</sub>C<sub>2</sub>/NG-650, confirming the formation of carbon materials. The Raman spectra in Figure 4c show that the typical D and G bands become remarkable in GL-Fe/Fe<sub>5</sub>C<sub>2</sub>/NG-650 compared to the other two samples, further evidencing the formation of graphitic carbon. XPS inspection also confirms the denitrogen process. As shown in Figure 4d, the peaks in the N 1s spectra at 400.8, 399.7, and 398.6 eV correspond to C-NH<sub>x</sub> (amino functional groups), sp $^3$  H $-N-[C]_3$ , and sp $^2$  C-N-C, respectively. [34] Compared with the N 1s spectra of g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>, the decrease of peak area ratio of C-NH<sub>x</sub> in GL-Fe/Fe<sub>5</sub>C<sub>2</sub>/NG-600 suggests the loss of  $-NH_2/-NH$  groups. Moreover, the N species in the GL-Fe/Fe<sub>5</sub>C<sub>2</sub>/NG-650 are assigned to pyridinic N, pyrrolic N, and graphitic N. The decrease of N content (Figure S8, Supporting Information) further confirms the denitrogen process. Based on the above analysis, a possible mechanism for the formation of such catalysts is proposed. Ferrocene will decompose and release gaseous products (H2, CH4, C5H6, etc.) when treated at a temperature higher than 550 °C,[45] and the -NH<sub>2</sub>/-NH groups in g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> are so unstable that they can be reduced by H2 without changing the main structure of g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>.<sup>[35]</sup> At a temperature below 600 °C, H<sub>2</sub> gas is expected to be released from the decomposition of ferrocene and the released H<sub>2</sub> will react with the -NH<sub>2</sub>/-NH groups in g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>,

leading to the exfoliation of the g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>.<sup>[35]</sup> With the temperature increased to 650 °C, Fe/Fe<sub>5</sub>C<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles are generated from the decomposition of ferrocene and g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> has begun to transform into graphitic carbon with relatively low crystalline degree. When the temperature is higher than 650 °C, the generated Fe/ Fe<sub>5</sub>C<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles will become more crystallized and most of the N will be removed from the basic structure of g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> to form N-doped graphene with the help of Fe/Fe<sub>5</sub>C<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles, which is similar to the previously reported result.[46] Meanwhile, graphitic layers are supposed to form on the surface of Fe/Fe<sub>5</sub>C<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles with the released hydrocarbon products from ferrocene as carbon source. The release of H<sub>2</sub> from the ferrocene favors the exfoliation of g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> at temperature below 600 °C, while the in situ generated Fe/Fe<sub>5</sub>C<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles promote the growth of N-doped graphene nanosheets and the outer graphene layers around the nanoparticles at temperature higher than 650 °C.

The ORR activity of the GL-Fe/Fe<sub>5</sub>C<sub>2</sub>/NG-800 catalyst is first evaluated through cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurement. A well-defined cathodic peak centered at 0.85 V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)) can be clearly observed when the electrolyte is saturated with O<sub>2</sub> (Figure 5a). This cathodic peak is more positive than that of commercial Pt/C (0.83 V, Figure S9a, Supporting Information), suggesting outstanding ORR catalytic activity of GL-Fe/Fe<sub>5</sub>C<sub>2</sub>/NG-800. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves of GL-Fe/Fe<sub>5</sub>C<sub>2</sub>/NG-800 (Figure 5b) and commercial Pt/C (Figure S9b, Supporting Information) are also recorded through the rotating disk electrode (RDE) setup at

different rotation speeds. Typically, a higher rotating speed with shortened diffusion distance delivers higher current density. Furthermore, the kinetic parameters for electron transfer numbers (*n*) are analyzed based on the RDE results according to the Koutecky–Levich (K–L) equation (Equations (1) and (2)). The corresponding linearity of K–L plots (inset of Figure 5b) suggests the first-order reaction kinetics toward the concentration of dissolved oxygen and similar electron transfer numbers for ORR at various potentials. The *n* value of GL-Fe/Fe5C2/NG-800 is calculated to be 3.95–3.98 at the potential ranging from 0.2 to 0.7 V, similar to that of commercial Pt/C (*n* ≈ 4.0, inset of Figure S9b, Supporting Information), indicating a four-electron pathway of ORR and the direct reduction of O2 to OH<sup>−</sup>. Prominently, with similar onset potential of 0.98 V, the half-wave potential of GL-Fe/Fe5C2/NG-800 is 20 mV more positive than that of the commercial Pt/C (*E*1/2, 0.86 vs 0.84 V in Figure 5c). The ORR activity of GL-Fe/Fe5C2/NG-800 is also superior to that of GL-Fe/Fe5C2/NG-700 and GL-Fe/Fe5C2/NG-900 (Figure S10, Supporting Information). The electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) of GL-Fe/Fe5C2/NG-700, GL-Fe/Fe5C2/NG-800, and GL-Fe/Fe5C2/NG-900 is determined to be 30, 85, and 45 cm2 , respectively (Figure S11, Supporting Information), further confirming the higher activity of GL-Fe/Fe5C2/NG-800. The main reason for the slightly inferior ORR activity of GL-Fe/ Fe5C2/NG-700 may be attributed to the relatively low conductivity resulting from the low graphitization degree as revealed by Raman spectra (Figure S12, Supporting Information). Whereas for GL-Fe/Fe5C2/NG-900, the leaching of active N species as detected by XPS (Figure S4, Supporting Information) at high temperature may be the main reason for the inferior ORR performance. Most importantly, the ORR performance of the present GL-Fe/Fe5C2/NG-800 catalyst is attractive among various carbon or iron carbide-based electrocatalysts (Table S1, Supporting Information). Rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) results (Figure 5d) show that the calculated yield of H2O2 measured with the GL-Fe/Fe5C2/NG-800 catalyst is below 1.8% (calculated by Equation (3)) at the potential ranging from 0.2 to 0.8 V. They correspond to high electron transfer numbers of 3.96–4.00 (calculated by Equation (4)), similar to that of commercial Pt/C. Notably, these results are consistent with the K–L plot obtained from the RDE results, further verifying the fourelectron pathway of the ORR reaction. Besides the high ORR activity, the possible fuel crossover effect and long-term stability are also quite important. When 50 mL of methanol is introduced into the O2-saturated electrolyte, the current density of Pt/C decreases drastically, while GL-Fe/Fe5C2/NG-800 is not so sensitive to methanol (Figure 5e), suggesting the strong tolerance of GL-Fe/Fe5C2/NG-800 to crossover effect. The durability of GL-Fe/Fe5C2/NG-800 and commercial Pt/C is also evaluated through chronoamperometric measurements (Figure 5f). After the durability test for 15 h, about 92% of the initial current density can be maintained, compared to 63% for Pt/C, suggesting the excellent stability of GL-Fe/Fe5C2/NG-800. Moreover, the structure of GL-Fe/Fe5C2/NG-800 can be well preserved after the stability test (Figure S13, Supporting Information).

The effect of the catalyst mass loading on the ORR performance is investigated through LSV measurement and the optimal mass loading is determined to be 0.15 mg cm−<sup>2</sup> (Figure S14, Supporting Information). We have also studied the effect of mass ratio of ferrocene to g-C3N4 on the ORR performance. The samples with ferrocene to g-C3N4 ratios of 2:1 and 0.5:1 are also synthesized and denoted as

GL-Fe/Fe5C2/NG-800-2 and GL-Fe/Fe5C2/NG-800-0.5, respectively. The GL-Fe/Fe5C2/NG-800-2 and GL-Fe/Fe5C2/NG-800-0.5 exhibit similar composition and morphology to those of GL-Fe/ Fe5C2/NG-800 (Figures S15 and S16, Supporting Information). In addition, NG can be obtained without adding ferrocene (Figure S15, Supporting Information). All the samples with different mass ratios of ferrocene to g-C3N4 show better ORR performance than NG (Figure S17, Supporting Information). The GL-Fe/Fe5C2/NG-800 with a ferrocene to g-C3N4 ratio of 1:1 displays the best ORR performance. The ORR performance of the GL-Fe/Fe5C2/NG-800 is also better than that of the reported CNT-supported Fe5C2 nanoparticles without the outer carbon layer,[28] highlighting the synergistic effect between the N-doped graphene nanosheets and graphene layers-wrapped Fe5C2 nanoparticles. In addition, the GL-Fe/Fe5C2/NG-800 also exhibits good ORR performance in acidic solution (Figure S18, Supporting Information), which is comparable to many reported metal/carbon-based electrocatalysts (Table S2, Supporting Information). To investigate the possible active sites, Mössbauer effect measurement is carried out to further identify the iron species in the GL-Fe/Fe5C2/NG-800. The spectra can be deconvoluted into one singlet and four sextets (Figure S19, Supporting Information). The assignment of the singlet and four sextets to specific Fe species and the related parameters are summarized in Table S3 (Supporting Information). Fe and Fe5C2 are the main Fe species in the GL-Fe/Fe5C2/NG-800, while no Fe-N4 species can be detected,[47–49] which suggests that Fe and Fe5C2 might be the main active centers for ORR.

On the basis of the structural and compositional characterization results, it is believed that five important aspects may be responsible for the superior ORR activity and stability. 1) The high specific surface area of the nanocomposites (856 m2 g<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> ) ensures sufficient active sites for electrochemical reactions and facilitates transport of ORR-relevant species. 2) The high percentage of nitrogen doped into the graphene nanosheets can promote O2 adsorption.[50,51] 3) The Fe/Fe5C2 nanoparticles wrapped in the graphene layers are more electrochemically active for ORR.[18,27] 4) The graphene layers could effectively suppress the dissolution and agglomeration of iron-rich nanoparticles thus promising good electrochemical activity and stability. 5) The synergistic effect between the N-doped graphene nanosheets and encapsulated Fe/Fe5C2 nanoparticles may also contribute to excellent ORR performance. Overall, the excellent electrocatalytic activity, long-term durability, and methanol tolerance ability of NG-Fe/Fe5C2/NG-800 make it a promising highly efficient electrocatalyst for ORR.

In summary, we have developed a high-performance ORR electrocatalyst consisting of graphene layers-wrapped Fe/Fe5C2 nanoparticles supported on N-doped graphene nanosheets via a facile solid-state reaction of g-C3N4 with ferrocene. The reaction mechanism between g-C3N4 and ferrocene is carefully investigated. The optimized NG-Fe/Fe5C2/NG-800 electrocatalyst exhibits ORR performance superior to commercial Pt/C catalyst, including pronounced activity, remarkable durability, and complete resistance to methanol crossover, making it an excellent nonprecious metal catalyst. The as-demonstrated facile synthetic strategy and proposed reaction mechanism may open a new avenue for developing N-doped graphene-based electrocatalysts for a variety of energy applications.

## **Experimental Section**

*Synthesis of Bulk g-C3N4*: The g-C3N4 was prepared according to a previous work by thermal polymerization of melamine.[9] In a typical synthesis, 10 g of melamine was placed in a ceramic boat with a cover and then heated to 550 °C with a ramp rate of 5 °C min−<sup>1</sup> in air and maintained at this temperature for 4 h. Finally, the yellow powder was collected for further use after the furnace cooling down to room temperature.

*Synthesis of GL-Fe/Fe5C2/NG Electrocatalysts*: In a typical synthesis, 0.2 g of as-prepared g-C3N4 and 0.2 g of ferrocene were mixed homogeneously by grinding for at least 30 min. Then the mixture was poured into a homemade quartz capsule and pyrolized at 800 °C for 2 h with a heating speed of 10 °C min−<sup>1</sup> in N2 atmosphere. To remove unstable and ORR-nonreactive phase, the pyrolized black powder was preleached in 1.0 m H2SO4 solution for 18 h. The product was collected by centrifugation, repeatedly washed with DI water and ethanol for 10 times, and then dried at 80 °C. Finally, the preleached sample was pyrolized for the second time in N2 atmosphere at the same temperature as the first pyrolysis progress for 2 h to obtain the final electrocatalyst. Before each pyrolysis process, high purity N2 was bubbled into the tube furnace for at least 1 h. In order to understand the formation mechanism of GL-Fe/Fe5C2/NG, the samples obtained at different heating temperatures were investigated. Additionally, the effect of the mass ratio of ferrocene to g-C3N4 on the ORR performance was also investigated. The mass of ferrocene was varied from 0.1 to 0.4 g, while the mass of the g-C3N4 was fixed at 0.2 g. The synthesis procedure was similar to that of GL-Fe/Fe5C2/NG-800. And pure NG was obtained without the addition of ferrocene.

*Materials Characterization*: The crystalline phase was analyzed by XRD measurements with a Philips PW3040/60 X-ray diffractometer using Cu-Kα X-ray source (λ = 0.15406 nm) radiation at a scanning rate of 0.06 s−<sup>1</sup> . The tube voltage and current are 40 kV and 40 mA, respectively. The morphology was observed by SEM with a Hitachi S-4800 scanning electron microanalyzer with an accelerating voltage of 15 kV. The samples were prepared by dispersing the products in ethanol and droped on silicon chip for obvervation. Microstructures were further characterized by TEM and HRTEM at 200 kV with a JEM-2100F field emission TEM. The surface composition of the samples was analyzed through XPS, using an ESCALab MKII X-ray photoelectron spectrometer with Mg Kα X-ray as the excitation source. For TEM measurements, samples were prepared by dispersing the products in ethanol and placing several drops of the suspension on holey carbon net supported on copper grid. N2 sorption isotherms were obtained at 77 K on a Micrometrics ASAP 2020 surface area and porosity analyzer after the sample had been degassed in vacuum at 200 °C for 4 h. FT-IR was carried out on a Nicolet 5700 FT-IR Spectrometer using the KBr pellet method. The 57Fe Mössbauer spectra were recorded using a Topologic 500 A spectrometer and a proportional counter at room temperature. 57Co(Rh) moving in a constant acceleration mode was used as radioactive source. All the isomer shift values were reported against the center of a room temperature spectrum recorded for a foil of α-Fe. Samples were protected by Ar during the Mössbauer measurements.

*Electrochemical Measurements*: The ORR performance was evaluated in a conventional three-electrode cell with a saturated calomel electrode (SCE, saturated KCl) and a Pt foil counter electrode at room temperature using WaveDriver 20 bipotentiostat (Pine Instrument Company, USA). All potentials in this study were converted to the RHE reference scale as follows: *E*(RHE) = *E*(SCE) + 0.059\*pH + 0.241. The electrolyte was 0.1 <sup>m</sup> KOH solution. An RDE with a glass carbon disk (5 mm in diameter) and an RRDE with a Pt ring (6.5 mm in inner diameter and 8.5 mm in outer diameter) and glass carbon disk (5.5 mm in diameter) coated with catalyst film were used as the working electrodes. For the catalyst ink, 3 mg of the catalyst was dispersed in 920 µL of ethanol and 80 µL of 5% Nafion solution. The mixture was then sonicated for 30 min to obtain a uniform suspension. Then a certain volume of catalyst ink was pipetted on the glass carbon substrate, giving a catalyst loading of 0.15 mg cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> for all samples including commercial Pt/C (20 wt% on carbon black, Alfa

Aesar). Before tests, the electrolyte solution was saturated with  $O_2$  by bubbling  $O_2$  into the cell for 30 min. CV or LSV tests were conducted in  $O_2$ - and  $N_2$ -saturated electrolyte from 0 to 1.2 V versus RHE with a sweep rate of 20 mV s<sup>-1</sup>. RDE tests were carried out in  $O_2$ -saturated electrolyte with a scan rate of 10 mV s<sup>-1</sup> at different rotation speeds from 1.2 to 0 V versus RHE. The fuel crossover effect tests were evaluated by chronoamperometry at the potential of 0.6 V versus RHE by RDE tests with a rotation speed of 1600 rpm with introducing 50 mL of methanol into 150 mL of 0.1 m KOH solution. The apparent electron transfer number was calculated by the K–L equation at various potentials as follows:

$$\frac{1}{j} = \frac{1}{j_{L}} + \frac{1}{j_{K}} = \frac{1}{B\omega^{1/2}} + \frac{1}{j_{K}}$$
 (1)

$$B = 0.2nFAC_0D_0^{2/3}v^{-1/6}$$
 (2)

where j is the measured current density,  $j_{\rm K}$  and  $j_{\rm L}$  are the kinetic and limiting current densities, respectively,  $\omega$  is the rotating speed, n is the electron transfer number, F is the Faraday constant (96485 C mol<sup>-1</sup>),  $C_0$  is the bulk concentration of  $O_2$  (1.2  $\times$  10<sup>-3</sup> mol L<sup>-1</sup>),  $D_0$  is the diffusion coefficient of  $O_2$  (1.9  $\times$  10<sup>-5</sup> cm² s<sup>-1</sup>), and v is the kinematic viscosity of the electrolyte (0.01 cm² s<sup>-1</sup>).

RRDE measurements were performed at the voltage range from 0 to 1.2 V versus RHE in  $O_2$ -saturated electrolyte at a rotation speed of 1600 rpm with a scan rate of 10 mV s<sup>-1</sup>. And the Pt ring potential with the collection efficiency of 0.37 provided by the manufacturer was set at 1.5 V. The yield of  $H_2O_2$  and the electron transfer number could be determined by the following equation

$$H_2O_2\% = 200 \frac{I_r/N}{I_d + I_r/N}$$
 (3)

$$n = 4 \frac{I_d}{I_d + I_r / N} \tag{4}$$

where  $I_d$  is the disk current,  $I_r$  is the ring current, and N is the current collection efficiency of the Pt ring, which was 0.37, provided by the manufacturer.

The ECSA was determined through Equation (5), where the double layer capacitance ( $C_{dl}$ ) value was estimated by the linear slope of the fitted line which was plotted by capacitive currents versus scan rates, and the  $C_s$  value was adopted as  $\approx 0.04$  mF cm $^{-2}$ .[52]

$$ECSA = \frac{C_{dl}}{C_s} \tag{5}$$

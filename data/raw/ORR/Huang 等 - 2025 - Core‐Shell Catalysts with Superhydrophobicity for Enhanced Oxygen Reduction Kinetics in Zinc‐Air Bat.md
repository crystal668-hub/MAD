**Zinc-air batteries (ZABs) operating in gas-solid-liquid three-phase systems suffer from sluggish reaction kinetics and low power output, which severely hinder their commercialization. To address these challenges, an integrated strategy is proposed combining core-shell heterophase catalytic species with superhydrophobic properties. The H**─**CoFe**─**CNT catalyst, featuring carbon nanotube-grown hollow cubic carbon cages, incorporates metal carbide@metal core-shell heterophase catalytic species and exhibits superhydrophobicity. The metal carbide@metal core-shell structure modulates the electronic state of catalytic sites, reduces the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) energy barrier, and enhances catalytic activity. Meanwhile, the superhydrophobic property of the catalyst creates an abundant triple-phase reaction interface, promotes oxygen accumulation at the air cathode, thereby improving ORR kinetics and boosting the power density of ZABs. The as-prepared H**─**CoFe**─**CNT catalyst demonstrates exceptional oxygen electrocatalytic activity, achieving a high ORR half-wave potential of 0.909 V and a low oxygen evolution reaction (OER) overpotential of 307 mV. Liquid ZABs assembled with this catalyst exhibit a peak power density of 255 mW cm<sup>−</sup>2, and outstanding durability. Moreover, quasi-solid-state ZABs deliver an ultrahigh peak power density of 610 mW cm<sup>−</sup>2, indicating promising practical applicability. This work opens a new avenue for developing high-power-density ZABs through the synergistic integration of core-shell heterophase catalytic species and superhydrophobic engineering.**

**1. Introduction**

Zinc-air batteries (ZABs) have attracted extensive attention in energy storage and conversion fields due to their high theoretical energy density (1086 Wh kg<sup>−</sup>1), low cost, and superior safety.[\[1–4\]](#page-10-0) However, the sluggish kinetics of oxygen reduction/evolution reactions (ORR/OER) at air cathodes and suboptimal gas-liquidsolid triple-phase interfaces significantly suppress electrocatalytic activity. This reduces the energy conversion efficiency, power density, and service life of ZABs.[\[5–8\]](#page-10-0) Although platinum- and rutheniumbased noble metal catalysts demonstrate exceptional oxygen electrocatalytic performance, their scarcity, high cost, and poor durability severely hinder large-scale applications.[\[9–11\]](#page-10-0) Therefore, developing cost-effective bifunctional ORR/OER electrocatalysts with high activity, robust durability, and enhanced reaction kinetics is crucial for advancing the widespread practical implementation of ZABs.

Over the past decade, transition metal nitrogen-carbon (TM─N─C) catalysts have been extensively investigated.[\[12–16\]](#page-10-0) Transition metal/alloy catalytic species embedded in carbon matrices have demonstrated excellent initial electrocatalytic activity. This is due to their tunable d─band electronic properties and interactions with the carbon matrix.[\[14,17–19\]](#page-10-0) However, the dissolution of active components and lattice collapse

under operational conditions lead to rapid degradation of cycling stability, severely limiting their practical service life.[\[20–22\]](#page-11-0) In contrast, transition metal carbides (TMC) exhibit outstanding corrosion resistance and structural stability owing to their strong

metal-carbon bonding and excellent electrical conductivity.[\[23–26\]](#page-11-0) By in situ growth of a transition metal carbide layer on the outer surface of transition metal/alloy species, one can not only enhance the electrocatalytic durability of the catalytic species but also form a heterophase core-shell structure of metal carbide@metal (TMC@TM). The built-in electric field generated at the heterointerface of this core-shell structure can modulate the electronic states of catalytic species, potentially leading to improved electrocatalytic activity.

In addition to the electrocatalytic activity of the catalyst, the discharge power density of ZABs operating in three-phase systems is closely related to oxygen concentration at the cathode and mass transport rates.[\[27,28\]](#page-11-0) The appropriate hydrophobicity of the catalytic cathode allows for the formation of an abundance of triple-phase active interfaces. This exposes more catalytic active sites, accelerates oxygen transport and capture, and improves cathode ORR kinetics and battery performance.[\[29–31\]](#page-11-0) Many researchers have attempted to improve cathode hydrophobicity through strategies like polytetrafluoroethylene coatings or trifluoromethyl-containing ionic liquids. However, these materials may cover active catalytic sites, reduce intrinsic catalyst activity, and fail to sufficiently improve device performance.[\[32,33\]](#page-11-0) Therefore, enhancing the hydrophobicity of the air electrode solely by modifying the surface structure of the catalyst could improve the kinetics of the electrode reaction while fully utilizing the catalyst's high activity. Additionally, the hollow nanocagelike structure of the catalyst facilitates electrolyte penetration and maximizes the utilization of active sites.[\[34–37\]](#page-11-0) Constructing hydrophobic properties by tailoring the catalyst surface morphology on this structure would more effectively enhance catalytic activity and reaction kinetics, thereby boosting the device's peak power density (Pmax). However, fabricating electrocatalysts with both TMC@TM heterophase catalytic species and hydrophobic hollow nanocage-like structures remains challenging. The underlying mechanisms for the corresponding performance enhancement in ZABs warrant detailed investigation.

Based on the above considerations, this study successfully prepared a high-performance oxygen electrocatalyst (H─CoFe─CNT) using the "chemical bath deposition-acid etching-impregnation-dicyandiamide-assisted pyrolysis" process. This catalyst contains a core-shell structure of TMC@TM and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) nanostructures on the surface of hollow carbon cages. These structures can effectively regulate the electronic structure of the catalytic species and optimize mass transfer at hydrophobic interfaces. Both experimental results and theoretical calculations showed that the built-in electric field (BIEF) present at the interface between transition metal carbide (Fe2.5C) and transition metal (Fe/CoFe) induced the charge redistribution of Fe2.5C, accelerated the desorption process of oxygen intermediates, and enhanced the ORR electrocatalytic activity. The H─CoFe─CNT catalysts exhibited a high half-wave potential (E1/2) of 0.909 V and a narrow bifunctional overpotential (ΔE) of 0.68 V. The hydrophobic structure of CNTs covering the surface of the hollow carbon cage fully exposed the catalytic active sites, facilitated the penetration of the electrode solution, accelerated the oxygen transport and diffusion of reaction intermediates at the air cathode, and enhanced the ORR catalytic kinetics. Thanks to these excellent properties, the H─CoFe─CNT-based liquid ZAB exhibits a Pmax of up to 255 mW cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> and a charge/discharge cycle life of more than 2800 h. The corresponding flexible quasi-solid zinc-air battery has a Pmax of up to 610 mW cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> and is capable of driving various electrical appliances under bending and hammering, presenting a broad and safe application prospect.

# **2. Results and Discussion**

#### **2.1. Catalyst Synthesis and Structural Characterization**

**Figure 1**[a](#page-2-0) shows the preparation process of several typical specimens. The XRD physical phase profiles of these several specimens are shown in Figure [1b.](#page-2-0) All three specimens contain diffraction peaks of carbon. In addition, H─Co─C contains diffraction peaks of Co, and both H─CoFe─CNT and H─CoFe contain diffraction peaks of Fe and Co3Fe7. The weakening of the H─CoFe─CNT diffraction peaks is related to the dicyandiamideassisted chemical vapor deposition (CVD) annealing process, which refines the metal particles, as inferred from the Scherrer formula. This process significantly changes the morphology and structure. The morphologies of the three samples are shown in Figure [1b–d.](#page-2-0) The H─Co─C is a hollow cubic structure, H─CoFe is a hollow cube with sporadic growth of nanotubes, and H─CoFe─CNT is a cube with luxuriant growth of nanotubes. It can be seen that the dicyandiamide-assisted CVD annealing process and the addition of Fe (Fe<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> adsorption) jointly promote the lush growth of CNTs on the cubic structure. Changes in the surface morphology of the catalysts significantly affected their surface hydrophobicity. The droplet contacts angles of H─Co─C, H─CoFe, and H─CoFe─CNT were 134°, 139°, and 151°, respectively (inset of Figure [1\)](#page-2-0). The H─CoFe─CNT specimens exhibited superhydrophobicity, just like the hair-covered surfaces of water striders, by growing a hierarchical structure of densely packed nanotubes on their cubic surfaces. This superhydrophobicity facilitates oxygen diffusion and transport at the air electrode of the zinc-air battery, accelerating the ORR reaction kinetics.

The microstructure and physical phase of the H─CoFe─CNT specimen were further analyzed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (**Figure 2**[\)](#page-3-0). Figure [2a,b](#page-3-0) shows the structure of the specimen as a hollow cube with nanotubes grown outside, and both the cube and the nanotube head contain particles. Figure [2c,g](#page-3-0) shows the particles with different features on the cube. They are found to be core-shell structures. After analysis by selected-area electron diffraction (insets of Figure [2c,g\)](#page-3-0) and Fourier transform analysis by the corresponding high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) (Figure [2d–f,h–j\)](#page-3-0), it was determined that the cores of these two particles are Co3Fe7 and Fe, respectively, and the physical phases of their shells are both Fe2.5C. It can be seen that two types of particles, Fe2.5C@Co3Fe7 and Fe2.5C@Fe, are embedded in the hollow cuboidal carbon matrix core-shell heterostructures. The BIEF formed on both sides of the heterogeneous interfaces will significantly alter the substances' charge distribution on either side, thereby affecting the core-shell structures' electrocatalytic performance. Figure [2k](#page-3-0) shows a high-resolution photograph of a CNT head particle, which was analyzed as Fe2.5C. Graphitic carbon encapsulated metal carbides are considered to be an excellent OER active species.[\[38,39\]](#page-11-0) The elemental mapping in Figure [2i](#page-3-0) shows

that the elements N and C are uniformly distributed in the specimen, and the metal particles are embedded in them. This structural feature of the H─CoFe─CNT specimen gives it a large specific surface area (636 m2 g<sup>−</sup>1) and abundant distribution of micropores and mesopores (Figure S1, Supporting Information), which facilitates the full contact and diffusion of electrolytes, reaction gases, and intermediates, and promotes the improvement of the catalyst performance.[\[40\]](#page-11-0)

The elemental composition and surface electronic states of the H─Co─C, H─CoFe, and H─CoFe─CNT samples were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The full XPS spectrum (**Figure 3**[a\)](#page-4-0) confirms the presence of the elements C, N, O, Co and Fe in the samples. The nitrogen content of H─Co─C (4.61%) and H─CoFe─CNT (4.82%) samples treated with dicyandiamide-assisted pyrolysis was found to be higher than that of H─CoFe (2.62%), which suggests that dicyandiamide-assisted pyrolysis is favorable for the introduction of the element N (Figure [3b\)](#page-4-0). Fitting of the N 1s highresolution XPS spectra (Figure [3c\)](#page-4-0) of these three specimens allowed further determination of the contents of pyridine nitrogen (398.5 eV), metal nitrogen (399.6 eV), pyrrole nitrogen (401.1 eV), graphite nitrogen (403.1 eV), and oxidized nitrogen (406.2 eV) in each of the specimens (Figure [3d\)](#page-4-0). The dicyandiamide-assisted CVD pyrolysis process was found to significantly increase the levels of metal and pyrrole nitrogen in H─CoFe─CNT specimens containing the same metals. This enhances the electrocatalytic

activity of the catalyst.[\[41–43\]](#page-11-0) Figure [3e](#page-4-0) illustrates the Co 2p highresolution XPS spectra of the three samples, which can be categorized into metallic Co0 (778.5 and 793.5 eV), divalent Co<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> (783.4 and 798.2 eV), and trivalent Co3<sup>+</sup> (780.6 and 796.1 eV), and satellite peaks (786.8, 801.6, 789.5, and 805.3 eV). It indicates the presence of cobalt in metallic state and coordination bond between cobalt and nitrogen in the sample. Figure [3f](#page-4-0) shows the high-resolution spectrum of Fe 2p, indicating the presence of different valence states of Fe in the sample, including metallic Fe0 (707.6 and 721.2 eV), divalent Fe2<sup>+</sup> (710.4 and 724.1 eV), and trivalent Fe3<sup>+</sup> (712.8 and 726.9 eV) and the corresponding satellite peaks (717.7 and 730.6 eV). The oxidation state of Fe may be related to surface oxidation or its coordination with nitrogen/carbon.

### **2.2. Electrocatalytic Performance**

The ORR electrocatalytic activity of several typical specimens was measured in oxygen-saturated 0.1 m KOH solution. Their linear scanning voltammetry (LSV) curves are shown in **Figure 4**[a.](#page-5-0) From this figure, the oxygen reduction onset potential (E0), halfwave potential (E1/2), and kinetic current density (JK) at 0.9 V for each specimen can be obtained (Figure S2, Supporting Information). It can be seen that the H─CoFe─CNT specimen has the most excellent onset potential (1.032 V), half-wave potential (0.909 V), and kinetic current density (8.16 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2), indicating the very excellent oxygen reduction electrocatalytic activity and oxygen reduction kinetic process of the H─CoFe─CNT specimen. The Tafel slopes of these specimens are shown in Figure [4b,](#page-5-0)

<span id="page-4-0"></span>**Figure 3.** a) The full XPS spectrum of H─Co─C, H─CoFe and H─CoFe─CNT; b) Content of N of the three catalysts; c) High-resolution XPS spectra of N 1s in catalysts; d) Content of different nitrogen species; High-resolution XPS spectra of e) Co 2p and f) Fe 2p in catalysts.

and the Tafel slope value of H─CoFe─CNT (54.11 mV dec<sup>−</sup>1) is significantly lower than that of Pt/C (98.98 mV dec<sup>−</sup>1), H─CoFe (72.02 mV dec<sup>−</sup>1), and H─Co─C (69.38 mV dec<sup>−</sup>1), which shows the superior ORR kinetic performance. This is closely related to its hydrophobic hollow cube/nanotube structure. The rotating ring disk electrode test (Figure [4c\)](#page-5-0) showed that the H2O2 yield of H─CoFe─CNT was consistently lower than 2% in the potential range of 0.4–0.8 V; moreover, its corresponding electron transfer number was in the range of 3.91–4, which were all significantly superior to the other specimens. The LSV curves of these specimens at different rotational speeds (1225–3025 rpm) and the corresponding K─L equation fitting curves (Figure S3, Supporting Information) confirm that the ORR exhibits first-order kinetics and that H─CoFe─CNT has a transfer number closer to four electrons. This indicates that the H─CoFe─CNT follows a fourelectron oxygen reduction pathway with high selectivity.

In addition, the H─CoFe─CNT catalyst exhibited remarkable oxygen reduction durability. Under the constant-voltage timedcurrent test condition, the current retention of H─CoFe─CNT at 0.5 V was 95.4%, which was superior to that of Pt/C (72.9%) (Figure S4, Supporting Information). Comparison of the LSV curves before and after this endurance test showed that the E1/2 of H─CoFe─CNT decayed by only 9 mV, whereas the E1/2 of Pt/C significantly decayed by 36 mV (Figure [4d\)](#page-5-0). The morphology of this specimen also did not change much before and after the tolerance test (Figure S5a, Supporting Information), and the XRD test after the tolerance test was still able to recognize the physical phase before the reaction (Figure S5b, Supporting Information). These indicate that the H─CoFe─CNT catalysts have excellent tolerance to ORR electrocatalytic reactions. This is attributed to the strong coupling effect between the transition metal and the graphitic carbon substrate on the one hand, and the hollow and hydrophobic structure of the conducting catalyst on the other hand, which promotes the smooth transport of the electrolyte and the reactive substances and guarantees the structural stability of the catalyst.

To verify the effectiveness of the prepared specimens as bifunctional catalysts for ZABs, their OER performance was tested in 1 m KOH solution (Figure [4e\)](#page-5-0). The oxygen evolution overpotential of H─CoFe─CNT at 10 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> was 307 mV versus RHE, which was superior to that of H─CoFe (403 mV), H─Co─C (449 mV), and RuO2 (335 mV). Transmission electron microscopy and XPS analyses showed that H─CoFe─CNT contained abundant species of graphitic carbon encapsulated metal carbide (Fe2.5C) and more content of pyridine nitrogen, which are considered to be the main factors for the enhancement of its OER activity.[\[44–46\]](#page-11-0) Additionally, the Tafel slope of the H─CoFe─CNT specimen is superior to that of the other specimens (Figure [4f\)](#page-5-0). The electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) of the specimens was positively correlated with double-layer capacitance (Cdl). The double layer capacitance of the prepared specimens under OER conditions is shown in Figure S6 (Supporting Information). It can be seen that H─CoFe─CNT has the highest Cdl value (10.49 mF cm<sup>−</sup>2), which is significantly larger than that of H─CoFe (4.65 mF cm<sup>−</sup>2) and H─Co─C (3.91 mF cm<sup>−</sup>2), suggesting that H─CoFe─CNT effectively exposes highly active catalytic sites. The tolerance of H─CoFe─CNT under OER conditions was determined by constant voltage timing current test (Figure S7, Supporting Information). After 90000 s at 1.54 V, the current retention of H─CoFe─CNT was 90% while that of RuO2 was 80%. Furthermore, the overpotential decay of H─CoFe─CNT before and after the tolerance test (14 mV) was better than that of RuO2 (22 mV), as shown in Figure [4g.](#page-5-0) This indicates that H─CoFe─CNT is more tolerant of OER electrocatalysis.

The overpotential difference between OER/ORR reactions (ΔE = Ej <sup>=</sup> <sup>10</sup> − E1/2) is an important indicator for evaluating the bifunctional properties of catalysts. The hollow cubic/nanotube micro-nano structures of H─CoFe─CNT facilitate reactive substance transport and exhibit excellent ORR/OER electrocatalytic activity. Consequently, its ΔE was as low as 0.68 V, much smaller than that of noble-metal-based Pt/C+RuO2 composite catalysts (Figure 4h) and some recently reported bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts (Figure 4i; Table S2, Supporting Information).

#### **2.3. Influence of Hydrophobicity on ORR Kinetics**

Since the ORR occurs in a solid-liquid-gas three-phase system with oxygen as the reactant, the oxygen mass transport characteristics at the electrode inevitably influence the ORR kinetic process. Under RDE testing conditions, the high-speed rotation of the electrode enables the catalyst to capture the limited dissolved oxygen in the electrolyte. In contrast, the gas diffusion electrode (GDE) can deliver significantly more oxygen to the electrocatalyst, allowing for more effective evaluation of both transport and reaction kinetics in ORR under conditions of sufficient oxygen supply. This approach provides more comprehensive information for improving the actual operational efficiency of ZABs.[\[47,48\]](#page-11-0)

The LSV curves of H─CoFe─CNT, H─CoFe, and Pt/C were tested using the GDE apparatus (**Figure 5**[a,b\)](#page-6-0). H─CoFe─CNT showed the most superior ORR current density and the mass transfer overpotential at 200 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> current density was 23 mV, which was significantly lower than that of H─CoFe (71 mV) and Pt/C (222 mV). And the impedance spectrum under this reaction condition shows that H─CoFe─CNT has the lowest diffusion resistance (13.05 Ω) (Figure [5c;](#page-6-0) Table S1, Supporting Information). These indicate that H─CoFe─CNT has a better ORR kinetic process, which is closely related to its excellent hydrophobicity (see Table S3, Supporting Information for the relationship between hydrophobic contact angle and transport overpotential).

Combined with the hydrophobic properties of the electrodes, the gaseous oxygen concentrations on the H–CoFe–CNT and H–CoFe electrodes were simulated using the finite element method (FEM) (Figure 5d). The results show that the  $\rm O_2$  concentration on the H–CoFe–CNT electrode is significantly higher than that on the H–CoFe electrode due to its superhydrophobic properties. These results suggest that improving the hydrophobicity of the catalytic electrode provides more abundant reactive oxygen to the catalyst, thereby affecting the ORR reaction kinetics.

To corroborate this view, the experimental technique of attenuated total reflection surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR-SEIRAS) was tested on H—CoFe and H—CoFe—CNT (Figure 5e,g). The in situ ORR was carried out in an oxygen-saturated 0.1 M KOH electrolyte. At the onset of the ORR (1.1 V vs RHE), the signal of adsorbed oxygen ( $O_2^*$ ) is more clearly observed on the H—CoFe—CNT specimen (at  $\approx 1061 \text{ cm}^{-1}$ ),<sup>[49]</sup> suggesting that more  $O_2$  is aggregated on the super-hydrophobic H—CoFe—CNT specimen, which is in agreement with the results of FEM simulations. The ORR gradually unfolds as the reaction potential decreases (1.1–0.2 V vs RHE).

Signals of reaction intermediates, such as the H—O—H bending and stretching vibrational signals of OOH\* at 1206 cm<sup>-1</sup>, OH\* at 1631 cm<sup>-1</sup>, and OH\* at 3343 cm<sup>-1</sup>, are more clearly observed on the H—CoFe—CNT specimen.<sup>[50–52]</sup> whereas the signals on H—CoFe are weaker and clearly discernible in the corresponding thermograms (Figure 5f,h). This suggests that the ORR kinetic process on the superhydrophobic characterized H—CoFe—CNT specimen is faster with more intermediate products.

## 2.4. Mechanism Study of H—CoFe—CNT

To further elucidate the origin of the exceptional oxygen reduction activity of the H—CoFe—CNT catalyst, we systematically investigated the mechanistic roles of its two core-shell structures (Fe<sub>2.5</sub>C@FeCo and Fe<sub>2.5</sub>C@Fe) in ORR through combined experimental approaches and density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

We prepared a comparison specimen of  $Fe_{2.5}C$ —NC and tested the XRD and XPS of  $Fe_{2.5}C$ —NC (**Figure 6**a,b). The XRD results show that the physical phase of  $Fe_{2.5}C$ —NC is  $Fe_{2.5}C$ . In addition,

the electronic binding energy of Fe 2p in H─CoFe─CNT shifts toward a higher binding energy as compared to that of Fe2.5C─NC, suggesting that the core-shell structure. The presence of FeCo and Fe metal phases in H─CoFe─CNT significantly modulates the electronic state of Fe2.5C. The LSV curves of the ORR regions of Fe2.5C and H─CoFe─CNT were tested experimentally (Figure 6c). The H─CoFe─CNT specimens with Fe2.5C@FeCo and Fe2.5C@Fe core-shell structures exhibited much superior ORR catalytic activity. This further confirmed that the heterogeneous core-shell structure significantly improved the ORR performance of the catalyst.

In order to further reveal the electronic states of the core-shell structure, the work function values () of Fe2.5C, FeCo, and Fe were calculated using DFT (Figure 6d; Figure S9, Supporting Information). Due to the difference in the value of the figure of merit () between them, the contact of Fe2.5C with FeCo and Fe results in the formation of Fe2.5C/FeCo and Fe2.5C/Fe heterogeneous interfaces, respectively, which in turn results in the formation of a built-in electric field, leading to the charge redistribution in the contact (Figure 6e; Figure S10, Supporting Information). The calculated differential charge density maps (Figure 6f; Figure S11, Supporting Information) show a decrease in electron density in the outer Fe2.5C layer and an increase in electron density in the inner FeCo and Fe layers in both core-shell structures. This indicates the flow of electrons from Fe2.5C to FeCo and Fe, which is consistent with the results of XPS analysis. In addition, three models of Fe2.5C, Fe2.5C@FeCo and Fe2.5C@Fe (Figure S12, Supporting Information) were constructed using VASP to calculate the free energy change of their four-electron processes in the ORR (Figure 6g), as well as the projected density of states (PDOS) (Figure 6h). Figure 6g shows the ORR free energy step diagrams for these three structures at U = 0 V. When U = 0 V, the ratedetermining step of the ORR process for Fe2.5C and Fe2.5C@FeCo is the desorption process of \*OH, which corresponds to reaction energy barriers ΔG values of 1.96 and 1.57 eV; and the ratedetermining step of the ORR process for Fe2.5C@Fe is the transition step of \*O to \*OH, which corresponds to a ΔG value of 0.68 eV. It can be seen that, compared to the single Fe2.5C, the

core-shell structure significantly reduces the ORR energy barrier. In addition, as can be seen from the PDOS of the Fe 3d orbitals in the ORR reaction (Figure [5i\)](#page-6-0), the d─band centers of Fe2.5C, Fe2.5C@FeCo-Fe2.5C@Fe are −0.89, −0.80, and −0.78 eV, respectively; the center of the d─band of the Fe 3d orbitals in the core-shell structure is shifted downward relative to that of Fe2.5C. This reduces the interaction between metal centers and oxygen intermediates, improving the desorption of \*OH. This is consistent with the ORR free energy step diagram results.

These results indicate that the core-shell heterostructure in H─CoFe─CNT modulates the charge distribution of external Fe2.5C, lowers the reaction energy barrier of ORR, accelerates the desorption of intermediates, and significantly enhances its ORR electrocatalytic activity.

## **2.5. Zinc-Air Batteries Performance**

Based on the excellent ORR/OER electrocatalytic activity of the H─CoFe─CNT specimen, an H─CoFe─CNT-based liquid ZAB was assembled (**Figure 7**a). Figure 7b shows its open-circuit voltage (OCV) of 1.53 V, which is higher than that of the Pt/Cbased zinc-air battery (1.43 V). The charge–discharge polarization curves of these two cells are shown in Figure 7c, and the H─CoFe─CNT-based ZAB has a low charge–discharge voltage spacing of 1.29 V at 100 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2, which is much lower than that of the Pt/C+RuO2-based ZAB (1.61 V), indicating its superior charge–discharge performance. The power density of the zinc-air battery is closely related to the ORR electrocatalytic activity of the electrocatalyst and the rate of reactive substance transport. The discharge polarization curves and power density curves of the two cells are shown in Figure 7d. The Pmax of the H─CoFe─CNT-based ZAB reached 255 mW cm<sup>−</sup>2, which was much higher than that of the Pt/C+RuO2-based ZAB (159 mW cm<sup>−</sup>2) and some recently reported catalysts (Figure 7e). This indicates that the excellent ORR electrocatalytic activity and superhydrophobicity of the H─CoFe─CNT catalyst effectively enhanced the reaction kinetics of ZAB, which significantly increased the Pmax of the cell. In addition, the specific capacity of H─CoFe─CNT-based ZAB at a constant current density of

5 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> was 780 mAh  $g_{\rm Zn}^{-1}$  (Figure 7f), which was higher than that of  $Pt/C+RuO_2$ -based ZAB (700 mAh  $g_{Zn}^{-1}$ ). The discharge curves of the H-CoFe-CNT-based ZAB and the Pt/C+RuO<sub>2</sub>-based ZAB at different current densities (2-20 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>) are shown in Figure 7g. The H-CoFe-CNT-based ZAB shows a smaller voltage drop. When the current density is restored to 2 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, the discharge voltage can be reversibly returned to the initial state. This indicates that H-CoFe-CNTbased ZAB has a lower degree of polarization and better multiplication performance. H-CoFe-CNT-based ZAB was subjected to cyclic charge/discharge at a constant current density of 5 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> (Figure 7h), and the charge/discharge voltage difference was almost unchanged after 2800 h of operation (≈8400 cycles), which demonstrated strong cyclic charge/discharge endurance. H-CoFe -CNT-based ZABs show unique advantages in terms of OCV, power density, and cycling stability, which are stronger than some excellent ZABs reported recently (Table S4, Supporting Information).

The outstanding performance of this ZAB can be attributed to three synergistic factors: 1) The TMC@TM core-shell structure effectively modulates the electronic state of catalytic sites, reduc-

ing the ORR energy barrier and significantly enhancing catalytic activity; 2) The superhydrophobic characteristic of the catalyst ensures high oxygen availability at the air cathode, creating abundant triple-phase reaction interfaces that not only maximize the exposure of catalytic sites but also accelerate the diffusion of reaction intermediates; 3) The active species, being either embedded in the carbon matrix or encapsulated by graphitic carbon, are effectively protected, thereby achieving exceptional long-term durability in highly alkaline electrolyte environments.

To make ZAB easier to use in portable devices, we made H—CoFe—CNT quasi-solid-state ZABs with a PANa gel electrolyte. The H—CoFe—CNT-based quasi-solid-state ZAB showed an OCV of 1.50 V and a P<sub>max</sub> of up to 610 mW cm<sup>-2</sup> (**Figure 8a**,b), which is significantly higher than that of the Pt/C+RuO<sub>2</sub>-based quasi-solid-state ZAB (1.43 V, 338 mW cm<sup>-2</sup>) as well as the recently reported oxygen electrocatalyst (Table S5, Supporting Information). The quasi-solid-state ZAB is directly exposed to air, and in an oxygen-rich supply environment, the electrocatalyst on the hydrophobic air cathode has the opportunity to be exposed to more oxygen, and its ORR reaction kinetics will be more efficient. As a result, the H—CoFe—CNT-based quasi-solid-state ZAB

<span id="page-10-0"></span>shows much higher Pmax than the liquid-state battery, which is also much higher than the Pt/C+RuO2-based quasi-solid-state ZAB. Figure [8c](#page-9-0) also shows that the H─CoFe─CNT-based quasisolid-state ZAB has smaller discharge voltage drop and superior discharge reversibility than Pt/C+RuO2-based quasi-solid-state ZAB. The voltage plateau of the flexible H─CoFe─CNT reference quasi-solid-state ZAB discharged under different bending states is relatively stable (Figure [8d\)](#page-9-0), showing the compatibility of device deformation and discharge. Under the constant-current charge/discharge cycling test at 2 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2, the operation time of the H─CoFe─CNT reference quasi-solid-state ZAB is more than 59 h, which is much longer than that of the Pt/C+RuO2 reference quasi-solid-state ZAB (≈26 h) (Figure [8e\)](#page-9-0). Figure [8f–h](#page-9-0) shows some application scenarios of the H─CoFe─CNT-based quasi-solid-state ZAB with an effective area of 1 × 1 cm2. It can be seen that two cells in series can light up a red light emitting diode (LED) display and drive a small fan even under hammering (Video S1, Supporting Information), and four cells in series can charge a cell phone (Video S2, Supporting Information). All these highlight the broad and safe application prospects of the H─CoFe─CNT-based quasi-solid-state ZAB.

# **3. Conclusion**

The fabrication of the superhydrophobic H─CoFe─CNT bifunctional electrocatalyst was achieved through a multistep process involving chemical bath deposition, acid etching, impregnation, and dicyandiamide-assisted pyrolysis. The H─CoFe─CNT catalyst has a unique microstructure characterized by hollow carbon cages wrapped in CNTs containing heterogeneous core-shell catalytic species (Fe2.5C@FeCo and Fe2.5C@Fe) and Fe2.5C nanoparticles wrapped in graphite. The H─CoFe─CNT demonstrates outstanding oxygen electrocatalytic activity with an ORR halfwave potential of 0.909 V and an OER overpotential of 307 mV. The corresponding liquid ZAB displays a high OCV (1.53 V), Pmax (255 mW cm<sup>−</sup>2), excellent specific capacity (780 mAh gZn<sup>−</sup>1), and remarkable durability (2800 h at 5 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2). The quasisolid-state ZAB achieves an ultrahigh Pmax of 610 mW cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> and can power various electronic devices under bending or hammering conditions, demonstrating promising and safe application prospects. These superior performances are attributed to: 1) The TMC@TM heterophase core-shell structure that modulates the electronic state of catalytic species, accelerates oxygen intermediate desorption, reduces the ORR energy barrier, and enhances electrocatalytic activity; 2) The hydrophobic structure of CNTcoated hollow carbon cages that creates abundant triple-phase interfaces, exposes more active sites, promotes electrolyte infiltration, accelerates oxygen transport and intermediate diffusion at the air cathode, thereby improving ORR kinetics and boosting the battery's Pmax; 3) The active species embedded in carbon matrices or encapsulated by graphite carbon that effectively protects these species and enhances their durability in strongly alkaline electrolytes. This work presents a novel approach by simultaneously focusing on constructing heterophase core-shell catalytic species and designing hydrophobic catalyst microstructures, which significantly improves both the electrocatalytic activity and reaction kinetics of oxygen catalysts, thereby opening new pathways for synergistic optimization of zinc-air battery performance.

### Abstract

The exploitation of high-efficiency, inexpensive, as well as durable electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is of vital importance for the commercialization of fuel cells. In this study, we prepared an efficient nonprecious ORR electrocatalyst via high-gravity technology. The results of physical characterization revealed that the Fe atoms could be uniformly dispersed on the Fe/Co/N-MCF catalyst via the high-gravity technology. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy demonstrated that the Fe can be combined with N from the ZIF-67 to form the Fe-N<sup>x</sup> structures, which has already been confirmed to be acted as validly ORR active sites. The electrochemical testing results showed that the Fe/Co/N-MCF catalyst obtained via high gravity technology expressed a 24 mV positive than commercial Pt/C in terms of half-wave potential. Moreover, Fe/Co/N-MCF catalyst exhibited an excellent anti-ethanol activity and durability, its current density only decays 2.6%, far lower than 23.3% of commercial Pt/C after 10,000 s chronoamperometry aging test.

## 1 | INTRODUCTION

Fuel cells, which acted as an efficient and green energy conversion device, have received a great attention in recent years.[1,2] However, the sluggish kinetics of the widespread utilization of fuel cells.[3] At present, Pt-based nanomaterials have been so far regarded as the most efficient ORR catalysts.[4–6] Nevertheless, its prohibitive cost enables scientists to develop cost-effective non-precious

recent years, researchers have done a lot of development and research about non-precious ORR catalysts, such as nitrogen-doped carbon materials (NC), transition metal sulfides (MxSy), non-precious-metal doped carbon materials (NPM/C), perovskite transition metal oxides (ABO3), spinel transition metal oxides (AB2O4), etc.[7–11] Among them, NPM/C, especially Fe or Co-based nitrogen-carbon (Fe or Co N C) electrocatalysts, have been theoretically and experimentally recognized as a kind of promising candidates to replace the Pt-based catalyst.[12–16] For example, a kinds of Co N C catalyst with Co nanoparticle (NP) embedded carbon was obtained via the pyrolysis of zeolites imidazole frameworks (ZIF-67) directly and the Co N C catalyst has shown an excellent ORR.[17] Unfortunately, their electrochemical activity and stability were still hard to meet the requirement for the practical applications and the preparation process was also energy-consuming and time-consuming. Therefore, it is strongly necessary to explore a highly effective approach to prepare the Fe or Co N C catalysts with a high ORR activity and durability.

The high-gravity technology, which is generally generated via a rotating packed bed (RPB), has been widely used in absorption, desorption, distillation, oxidation, crystallization, precipitation, polymerization, and production of NPs since the first RPB was introduced in the 1970s.[18–21] A schematic diagram of a typical RPB is shown in Scheme 1. The principle of the RPB is to use the rotator to create a high-gravity force field in the packing. Under high-gravity, molecule diffusions are much faster than under normal gravity due to the injected liquid flow can be split continuously into discrete liquid ligaments, thin films, and tiny droplets by the rotating porous packing.[22–24] Therefore, the mixing and mass-transfer processes can be intensified and the chemical reaction time and energy consumption can be dramatically decreased via utilizing the RPB.

Thus, we herein prepared an efficient non-precious ORR electrocatalyst for fuel cells via the high-gravity

technology for the first time. The fabrication process is shown in Scheme 2. In brief, a kind of Co-based N-doped mesoporous carbon material (Co/N-MCF) with high specific surface area was first obtained by pyrolysis of the ZIF-67. Then, the Fe ions were adsorbed on the Co/N-MCF in 10 min by using RPB equipment, and the obtained composite was pyrolyzed again to acquire the target catalyst Fe/Co/ N-MCF. The results of physical characterization revealed that the Fe atoms could be uniformly dispersed on the Fe/Co/N-MCF catalyst via the RPB and the Fe content in the Fe/Co/N-MCF catalyst was too low to form the NPs. However, the trace of the Fe can be combined with N from the ZIF-67 to form the Fe-N<sup>x</sup> structure, which has already been confirmed to be acted as validly ORR active sites.[25–27] The electrochemical testing results showed that the Fe/Co/ N-MCF catalyst obtained via high gravity technology expressed a much better catalytic activity for ORR compared to Fe/Co/N-MCF (M) prepared by magnetic stirring method. Moreover, the Fe/Co/N-MCF catalyst exhibited an excellent stability and anti-ethanol activity. This research will provide a new strategy to prepare the high performance non-precious ORR catalysts for fuel cells.

## 2 | RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The morphologies of synthesized materials were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As shown in Figure S1a, the prepared ZIF-67 possesses a regular polyhedral structure with distribution uniform particle size of about 500 nm. After pyrolyzing at the temperature of 750C in N2 atmosphere, the obtained Co/N-MCF still maintained the frame structure though its size became a little shrinked (Figure S1b). With the Fe elements loaded on the Co/N-MCF via RPB and the acquired products pyrolyzed again at N2 atmosphere, the obtained Fe/Co/ N-MCF catalyst remained in the same morphology with the Co/N-MCF (Figure 1a). The SEM-energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy mapping (Figures 1b–d and S2) shows that the Co, Fe, N, and C atoms are homogeneously distributed on the Fe/Co/N-MCF catalyst, and the overlapped elemental signals on the corresponded frameworks (Figure 1d) reveals that the relative content of Co atoms is much higher than Fe atoms. The TEM image (see in Figure 1e) further verifies that the obtained Fe/Co/N-MCF catalyst maintains a frame structure with polyhedral structure and the NPs less than 10 nm are presented at the edge of the frameworks (Figure S3). The high resolution TEM image of Fe/Co/N-MCF in Figure 1f reveals that the lattice fringes of the NPs are around 0.205 nm, which is consistent with (111) plane of cubic

Co. The absence of Fe NPs in the Fe/Co/N-MCF may be due to the lower iron content.

The prepared samples were further characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD). As shown in Figure S4, the ZIF-67 exhibits the well-defined XRD patterns and perfectly matches the characteristic peak of the simulated ZIF-67, demonstrating the ZIF-67 were successfully prepared. After the pyrolyzing process, the diffraction peaks of the obtained Co/N-MCF (red line in Figure 2) were consistent perfectly with the Co (PDF#15-0806), verified the Co ions in the ZIF-67 could be converted into Co NPs under high temperature. However, whether the subsequently RPB strategy or the magnetic stirring method to load the Fe on the Co/N-MCF, the obtained Fe/Co/N-MCF, and Fe/Co/N-MCF (M) catalysts were only examined the presence of Co NPs from the XRD patterns in Figure 2 (blue line and green line), and no peaks consistent of Fe (PDF#06-0696) were observed. This further confirms the hypothesis that the Fe is difficult to form crystal particles due to its relative lower content. The N2 adsorption–desorption isothermal curves, as shown in Figures S5 and S6, revealed that the Co/N-MCF materials possessed the rich mesoporous structures with a BET surface area of 392 cm<sup>2</sup> /g. After loading the Fe atoms on the Co/N-MCF via RPB strategy, the BET surface area of the obtained Fe/Co/N-MCF catalyst is changed to 337 cm<sup>2</sup> /g, which is higher than the Fe/Co/N-MCF (M) catalyst (299 cm<sup>2</sup> /g) obtained by the magnetic stirring method.

The content and valence of the elements located on the surface of the Co/N-MCF, Fe/Co/N-MCF (M), and Fe/Co/N-MCF were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). As shown in Figure S7, trace of Fe

FIGURE 2 XRD of Co/N-MCF, Fe/Co/N-MCF (M), and Fe/Co/N-MCF

elements was detected both on the surface of the Fe/Co/ N-MCF (M) and Fe/Co/N-MCF, and the contents of Fe for Fe/Co/N-MCF (M) and Fe/Co/N-MCF catalysts are 0.15 and 0.47% (Table S1), respectively. The total content of the Fe atom detected by the inductively coupled plasma in the Fe/Co/N-MCF (M) and Fe/Co/N-MCF catalysts are 0.08 and 0.39%, respectively. These results revealed the reason why the Fe NP is hardly formed in the Fe/Co/N-MCF catalysts. Nevertheless, previous literature reports have proved that the trace amounts of iron can effectively improve the ORR activities in the kinds of Fe-N-C catalysts.[28] In addition, all the prepared materials found the presence of nitrogen, demonstrating the N atoms contained in the 2-methylimidazole were doped in the catalysts. From the high-resolution spectra of N 1s in the Figure 3, we found that all the three as-synthesized catalysts can be fitted into pyrrolic N and pyridinic N at 400.6 and 398.5 eV, respectively. The graphitic N is emerged at 401.4 eV both in the Fe/Co/N-MCF and Fe/Co/N-MCF (M) catalyst. However, the Fe/Co/N-MCF catalyst was found in the presence of the Fe-N<sup>x</sup> species (399.7 eV), which has been verified to be the efficient active sites for ORR according to previous reports.[29,30] Therefore, these results revealed that the high gravity technology could more validly promote the Fe ion to combine with the Co/N-MCF compared to the traditional magnetic stirring method due to the excellent mass transfer in the RPB. Moreover, RPB would affect the way Fe bound to the Co/N-MCF, which promoted the formation of the Fe-N<sup>x</sup> with a higher electrocatalytic activity for ORR, rather than producing graphitic N with a lower ORR catalytic activity.

FIGURE 4 LSV curves of Fe/Co/N-MCF, Fe/Co/N-MCF (M), Co/N-MCF, and Pt/C catalyst in O2-saturated 0.1 M NaOH at 1,600 rpm; scan rate: 10 mV/s

The ORR catalytic performances of Fe/Co/N-MCF, Fe/Co/N-MCF (M), Co/N-MCF, and commercial Pt/C catalysts were evaluated via linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) in an O2-saturated 0.1 M NaOH aqueous solution. As shown in the Figure 4, both Fe/Co/N-MCF and Fe/Co/N-MCF (M) catalysts show a better catalytic activity compared to Co/N-MCF in terms of onset potential and half-wave potential (E1/2). This demonstrates that the introducing of trace Fe atoms does promote the ORR activity for the Co/N-MCF. However, we found the Fe/Co/N-MCF catalyst obtained via high gravity technology expressed a positive catalytic activity for ORR compared to Fe/Co/N-MCF (M) prepared by magnetic stirring method, and the E1/2 of the Fe/Co/N-MCF catalyst even showed a 24 mV positive than that in the commercial Pt/C catalyst, indicating the high gravity technology is indeed effectively improved the ORR activity of the Fe/Co/N-MCF. We attributed the increased activity of the Fe/Co/N-MCF catalyst to the fact that the Fe can be more uniformly distributed on the surface of Co/N-MCF to form more Fe-N<sup>x</sup> active sites due to the efficient mass transfer by the RPB.

To illustrate the kinetic characteristics of the ORR, as shown in Figure 5a, the LSV curves of the Fe/Co/N-MCF catalyst were conducted at 100, 400, 900, 1,600, and 2,500 rpm. Then the K-L plots (inset Figure 5b) obtained from LSV curves at different rotation speeds revealed the transferred electron number (n) of ORR occurred on the Fe/Co/N-MCF catalyst was nearly 4, demonstrating the ORR process catalyzed by the Fe/Co/N-MCF catalyst can convert the O2 to the H2O directly, rather than to produce the H2O2 via a 2e<sup>−</sup> process. Moreover, the antimethanol tests of Fe/Co/N-MCF were also measured with

the JM Pt/C as a comparison in the methanol-contained 0.1 M NaOH. From the Figure 5c, we can apparently observe that the ORR curves of Fe/Co/N-MCF showed no change before and after the presence of the methanol. However, the JM Pt/C shows a large fluctuation after introducing the methanol (Figure 5d), verifying the Fe/Co/N-MCF catalyst has a high selectivity toward the ORR with a remarkable tolerance for methanol.

Stability is another crucial important criterion for the ORR catalysts in the applications of fuel cells. Thus, the stability of the Fe/Co/N-MCF catalyst was evaluated by the chronoamperometric method at the voltage of 0.85 V (vs. RHE) in the O2-saturated 0.1 M NaOH. The test results showed that 97.4% of the original current density was retained for the Fe/Co/N-MCF catalyst after 10,000 s test at 400 rpm, while only 76.7% was reserved for the JM Pt/C catalyst at the same condition (Figure 6), demonstrating that the Fe/Co/N-MCF catalyst possesses an excellent stability for ORR.

## 3 | EXPERIMENTAL

## 3.1 | Preparation of Co/N-MCF

The precursor (ZIF-67) was prepared using CoCl2 6H2O as Cobalt sources, and 2-Methylimidazole as nitrogen source.

FIGURE 6 Current-time (i-t) chronoamperometric of Fe/Co/ N-MCF and JM Pt/C (Pt: 25 μgPt/cm<sup>2</sup> )

In a typical synthesis, 5 mmol (1.190 g) CoCl2 6H2O and 40 mmol (3.284 g) 2-Methylimidazole were dissolved in 100 ml methanol. Then, solution CoCl2 6H2O was added dropwise to solution 2-methylimidazole under stirring (500 rpm). After stirring for another 5 min, the resulting mixed solution was left standing for 24 hr. Finally, the supernatant was poured out and the purple precipitate attached to the beaker was centrifuged with a high-speed centrifuge (8,000 rpm for 20 min), then the precipitation was washed with methanol by centrifugation (7,000 rpm for 10 min) three times and dried overnight at 80°C to obtain pure purple ZIF-67. Lastly, the obtained ZIF-67 was pyrolyzed under nitrogen atmosphere at 750°C for 2 hr at a heating rate of 5°C/min to acquire the Co/N-MCF.

# 3.2 | Synthesis of Fe/Co/N-MCF and Fe/Co/N-MCF (M)

A total of 0.1 mol (27.029 g) FeCl $_3$  6H $_2$ O was dissolved into 200 ml deionized water to obtain 0.5 mol/L FeCl $_3$  solution, and then added 0.050 g Co/N-MCF to the above FeCl $_3$  solution. Afterward, the above mixed solution was introduced to the RPB to recycle for 10 min under about 600 rpm (3.3 times the acceleration of gravity), and then collected the mixed solution to the beaker. After that, the mixture was centrifuged and washed with deionized water three times, and then dried at 80°C for 24 hr. Finally, the obtained black precipitate was pyrolyzed under nitrogen atmosphere at 750°C for 2 hr at a heating rate of 5°C/min. Thus, the Fe/Co/N-MCF catalyst was obtained.

For comparison, other experimental conditions remain the same, we used magnetic stirring instead of RPB to prepare another Fe/Co/N-MCF, and denoted as Fe/Co/N-MCF (M) in this research.

# 3.3 | Physical characterization of the catalysts

Low-resolution TEM was carried out on an FEI Tecnai G220S-TWIN instrument operating at 120 kV. Highresolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) was carried out on a Zeiss LIBRA 200 FETEM instrument operating at 200 kV. SEM was obtained using a JSM-7800F (JEOL) field emission SEM operated at an acceleration voltage of 15 kV. XRD patterns were recorded on an XRD-6000 using Cu Kr radiation ( $\lambda = 1.5418 \text{ Å}$ ) at a step rate of 2°/s. XPS was acquired using a Kratos XSAM800 spectrometer equipped with monochromatic Al X-ray source (Al KR, 1.4866 keV), the vacuum in the analysis chamber was maintained at 10<sup>-7</sup> Pa, and the binding energy was calibrated by using 284.5 eV as the C 1s peak energy. Specific surface areas were recorded by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller nitrogen adsorptiondesorption on a Tristar II 3020 gas adsorption analyzer (Micromeritics, Norcross, GA).

### 3.4 | Electrochemical measurement

The catalysts were evaluated electrochemically in threeelectrode cell, in which 0.1 M NaOH was used as the electrolyte, a saturated Ag/AgCl electrode and a Pt wire were used as reference and counter electrodes, respectively. The electrocatalytic activity of catalysts for oxygen reduction was determined by LSV at a sweep rate of 10 mV/s with a rotating disk electrode (RDE). The measurements were performed at 25°C after purging O2 or N2 for 30 min. RDE measurements were conducted with a varying rotating speed of 100-2,500 rpm. A glassy carbon disk of 5 mm diameter coated with a film of catalyst was used as working electrode. To prepare the working electrode, 2 mg of a prepared catalyst and a drop of 0.1 wt% Nafion solution were ultrasonically dispersed in 400 µl of a water-ethanol (1:1 vol/vol) mixed solvent to form a homogeneous ink. As a comparison, 2 mg of Pt/C (40% Pt) was ultrasonically dispersed in 800 µl of ethanol with a drop of a 0.1 wt% Nafion solution via using micropipette. Then 24 and 5 μl of the catalyst ink were loaded onto an RDE, respectively. After evaporation of ethanol in air, the catalyst layer was covered with a thin film of Nafion by adding a drop of 0.01 wt% Nafion solution via using micropipette. Finally, the RDE was dried at air temperature. All potentials in this study are given relative to the potential of the reversible hydrogen electrode.

## 3.5 | Koutecky-Levich equation

The slopes of the best linear fit lines were used to calculate the transferred electron number (n) per oxygen molecule in the ORR process based on the Koutecky–Levich equations:

$$\frac{1}{J} = \frac{1}{J_{\rm L}} + \frac{1}{J_{\rm K}} = \frac{1}{{\rm Bw}^{1/2}} + \frac{1}{J_{\rm K}} \tag{1}$$

$$B = 0.2nFC_0(D_0)^{2/3}u^{-1/6}$$
 (2)

where J is the measured current density,  $J_{\rm K}$  and  $J_{\rm L}$  are the kinetic- and diffusion-limiting current densities,  $\omega$  is the electrode rotating speed in rpm, n is the electron transfer number in oxygen reduction, F is the Faraday constant (F=96,485 C/mol),  $C_0$  is the bulk concentration of  $O_2$  ( $C_0=1.2\times 10^{-6}$  mol/cm³),  $D_0$  is the diffusion coefficient of  $O_2$  ( $1.93\times 10^{-5}$  cm²/s), and  $\mu$  is the kinematic viscosity of the electrolyte (0.01 cm²/s). The constant 0.2 is adopted when the rotating speed is in rpm.

The specific kinetic current densities (Jk) associated with the intrinsic activity of the catalysts can be obtained by the following relation:

$$J_{k} = \frac{J_{d} * J}{J_{d} - J}$$

where J is the measured current density, J<sup>k</sup> is the kinetic current density, and J<sup>d</sup> is the diffusion-limited current density, respectively.

## 4 | CONCLUSIONS

In summary, the high gravity technology was introduced in this study to prepare a high efficiency non-precious ORR catalyst (Fe/Co/N-MCF) for the fuel cells. The physical characterization results revealed that the Fe atoms could be uniformly dispersed on the Fe/Co/N-MCF catalyst via the RPB and the Fe content in the Fe/Co/N-MCF catalyst was too low to form the NPs. What is more, the high resolution XPS spectrums demonstrated the trance of the Fe can be combined with N from the ZIF-67 to form the Fe-Nx structure, which has already been confirmed to be acted as valid ORR active sites. The electrochemical testing results showed that the Fe/Co/N-MCF catalyst obtained via high gravity technology expressed a much better catalytic activity for ORR compared to Fe/Co/N-MCF (M) prepared by magnetic stirring method, and the Fe/Co/N-MCF catalyst even surpassed the commercial Pt/C catalyst about 24 mV in terms of the E1/2. Moreover, the Fe/Co/N-MCF catalyst exhibited an excellent stability and antiethanol activity compared to Pt/C catalyst. Therefore, the Fe/Co/N-MCF catalyst obtained via the high gravity technology can be used as a promising ORR catalyst for fuel cells. This research will also provide a new strategy to prepare the high performance non-precious ORR catalysts for fuel cells.

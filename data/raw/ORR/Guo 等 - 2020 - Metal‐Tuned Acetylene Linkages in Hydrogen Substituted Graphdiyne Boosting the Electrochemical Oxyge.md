**Different from graphene with the highly stable sp2 -hybridized carbon atoms, which shows poor controllability for constructing strong interactions between graphene and guest metal, graphdiyne has a great potential to be engineered because its high-reactive acetylene linkages can effectively chelate metal atoms. Herein, a hydrogen-substituted graphdiyne (HsGDY) supported metal catalyst system through in situ growth of Cu3Pd nanoalloys on HsGDY surface is developed. Benefiting from the strong metal-chelating ability of acetylenic linkages, Cu3Pd nanoalloys are intimately anchored on HsGDY surface that accordingly creates a strong interaction. The optimal HsGDY-supported Cu3Pd catalyst (HsGDY/Cu3Pd-750) exhibits outstanding electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) with an admirable half-wave potential (0.870 V), an impressive kinetic current density at 0.75 V (57.7 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> ) and long-term stability, far outperforming those of the state-of-the-art Pt/C catalyst (0.859 V and 15.8 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> ). This excellent performance is further highlighted by the Zn–air battery using HsGDY/Cu3Pd-750 as cathode. Density function theory calculations show that such electrocatalytic performance is attributed to the strong interaction between Cu3Pd and CC bonds of HsGDY, which causes the asymmetric electron distribution on two carbon atoms of CC bond and the strong charge transfer to weaken the shoulder-to-shoulder <sup>π</sup> conjugation, eventually facilitating the ORR process.**

Two-dimensional graphene, including graphene oxide and reduced graphene, as a promoter or supporter for nanoparticles, is an important milestone toward the development of efficient nanocatalysts.[1,2] Benefiting from the large specific surface area and high electrical conductivity,[3,4] graphene enables high loading of nanoparticles onto separate sites of 2D sheets, which allows catalytically active species free from agglomeration and retains the stability of nanostructure in various electrolyte solutions, thus prolonging the lifespan of catalyst.[2,5–8] The high conductivity of graphene facilitates charge transport between catalyst surface and reaction intermediates.[2] However, it is noted that graphene is highly stable in terms of chemical property due to the strong sp2 hybridized carbon atoms. Such stability to some extent precludes the formation of strong interactions between graphene and metal catalysts that makes the high conductivity of graphene difficult to be well harnessed for fast electron transfer.[9,10] The engineering of strong interactions plays a critical role in tuning electronic

state of supporters and supported species for facilitating catalysis process.[11–13] Although some defect and functionalization strategies have been introduced,[8,14–17] engineering the strong interactions to enhance the catalytic activity of graphenesupported compounds is still far from being controllable and tunable.

Graphdiyne (GDY), a novel 2D carbon allotrope containing sp-sp2 hybridized carbon atoms, has shown great potential in various fields, including catalysis, energy storage and conversion, and field-emission devices.[10,18–22] The network structure of GDY can be defined as the benzene rings interconnected by high-energy acetylene linkages (CC).[19,23,24] High-degree sp-hybridized carbon in GDY can facilitate the arbitrary angle rotation of π conjugation system, which allows CC bonds with high reactivity to turn toward guest metal atoms, and firmly chelate them.[25,26] Accordingly, such chelation very likely creates the effective GDY-metal interaction, which is much stronger than that of graphene-supported metal atoms. The strong interaction usually gives rise to the interfacial effects, such as atomic distortion, weakening of chemical bond and charge spatial redistribution, dramatically expediting electron

transfer between active sites and reactants and, thereby, enhancing catalytic activity.[27,28] Besides, the electronic configuration of carbon atoms in acetylenic linkages that has been identified as active sites can be also influenced.[29,30] The high reactivity of sp-hybridized CC bonds in GDY provides many possibilities for achieving strong interaction at the interface of GDY-supported nanoparticle compounds. Combining these changes at heterointerface of two components indicates a high possibility to enhance the catalytic performance of GDY-supported metal system.[31]

In this work, we design a hydrogen-substituted graphdiyne (HsGDY) supported metal system through in situ formation of Cu3Pd nanoalloys on the surface of HsGDY by annealing. As a proof-of-concept, Cu3Pd nanoalloys intimately anchor on the surface of HsGDY that accordingly creates the strong interaction between HsGDY and Cu3Pd nanoalloy, and, thereby, promotes the charge transfer between them. The π conjugation of acetylenic linkages is remarkably weakened that causes the structural distortion of flat HsGDY surface. Considering the semiconductor feature of HsGDY, we use reduced graphene oxide (rGO) because of its highly electrical conductivity to separately hold HsGDY/Cu3Pd nanocomposites for shuttling charge between electrode and catalyst. As expected, the optimal HsGDY/Cu3Pd-750 catalyst obtained at 750 °C in N2 atmosphere exhibits the excellent catalytic activity toward the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), which outperforms the state-of-theart Pt/C catalyst, in terms of half-wave potential and kinetic current density as well as long-term stability. Besides, when employed HsGDY/Cu3Pd-750 as the air cathode in Zn–air battery, the as-assembled battery displays the much superior battery performance and long cycle lifespan to those of its counterpart based on the commercial Pt/C.

The morphology, microstructures, and composition of the as-prepared samples were first investigated by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As shown in **Figure 1**a and Figure S1 (Supporting Information), HsGDY in a spherical shape with the diameter of about 300 nm is successfully wrapped by thin GO nanosheets with the wrinkled texture, instead of laying on the surface of GO nanosheet. HsGDY carbon wrapped by GO nanosheet is confirmed by the X-ray diffraction pattern (XRD, Figure S1d, Supporting Information) that reveals a characteristic carbon peak at about 21°, which is distinct from the peak position of graphene due to the interlayer spacing of 4.19 Å for HsGDY.[30,32] This XRD result is well consistent with that of pristine HsGDY carbon (Figure S2, Supporting Information).

After the high-temperature treatment for 4 h in N2 atmosphere, some nanoparticles are observed on the surface of the samples (Figure 1b and Figure S3, Supporting Information). Apart from the C(002) peaks, the XRD patterns in Figure S4a (Supporting Information) show three obvious diffraction peaks for HsGDY/Cu3Pd-*X* products, where *X* represents the anneal temperature. These peaks are well located between the facecentered cubic (fcc) Cu and Pd, indicating the typical Cu–Pd alloy crystalline with fcc phase structure.[33,34] Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) determines the average content of Cu–Pd nanoalloy to be 23.7 wt% with Cu/Pd ratio of 3.1, which defines the Cu3Pd nanoalloy (Table S1, Supporting Information). The XPS survey spectra also confirm the presence of C, Cu, and Pd elements (Figure S4b, Supporting Information). The Cu3Pd nanoalloys can be attributed to in situ reduction of the residual Cu and Pd species by hightemperature treatment (Figure S5, Supporting Information). HsGDY is featured with a large molecular pore (Figure S6, Supporting Information), which provides abundant space to trap metal precursors. The representative SEM and TEM image reveal the microstructural information of in situ growth of Cu3Pd nanoalloys on the surface of HsGDY supported by GO nanosheets, which is obtained at 750 °C in N2 atmosphere (HsGDY/Cu3Pd-750). As shown in Figure 1b,c, the light- or dark-contrast Cu3Pd nanoalloys with the average diameter of 34.5 ± 2.5 nm are closely anchored on the HsGDY surface. Importantly, the heterostructural nanojunction, indicated by the green dot curve in Figure 1d, is remarkably observed at the HsGDY-Cu3Pd boundary, where Cu3Pd nanoalloy in a wedge shape firmly interfaces with the HsGDY surface, indicating the formation of strong interaction between HsGDY and Cu3Pd nanoalloy. The annealed GO (rGO) nanosheet is used as a nanomat to hold HsGDY-Cu3Pd nano-heterostructures for shuttling charge. Interestingly, an untight interface between rGO and Cu3Pd nanoalloy is also observed (Figure 1e), which can be ascribed to the highly stable carbon atoms of rGO. These results suggest the sandwich-like rGO-Cu3Pd-HsGDY structure. A closer look at Cu3Pd nanoalloy and amorphouscrystalline HsGDY in the HRTEM image exhibits the conformational fluctuation of HsGDY nanoparticles,[32] and the clear crystal lattice with the lattice spacing of 0.217 nm (Figure 1d), corresponding to the parallel (111) plane of Cu3Pd alloy.[33] EDS element mapping and EDS line scan profiles (Figure 1f) across an individual Cu3Pd nanoalloy show a rather homogenous distribution of Cu and Pd in the whole profile, indicative of the alloyed microstructure of Cu and Pd, which is in line with the XRD and ICP-MS results.

Different from graphene, HsGDY, a carbon-rich polymer, is featured by 42-C hexagons with six benzene rings interconnected by butadiyne linkages (Figure S6, Supporting Information). The physiochemical properties of the as-prepared samples were characterized by spectra technologies. **Figure 2**a displays two FT-IR spectra for HsGDY/Cu3Pd-750 and the annealed pristine HsGDY (HsGDY-750), each of which reveals five peaks for C–C and C–H structures existing in HsGDY/ Cu3Pd-750 and HsGDY-750. The peak at ≈1500 cm<sup>−</sup>1 indicates the skeletal vibrations of sp2 carbon in the aromatic rings, and the peaks at ≈860 and 3000 cm−<sup>1</sup> are attributed to the bending and stretching vibration of the aromatic C–H structure, respectively. The asymmetric stretching mode for C–C structure also can be ascribed to the peak at about 1216 cm<sup>−</sup>1. Importantly, the peak at ≈2200 cm−<sup>1</sup> suggests the existence of CC bonds in both of them. From the Raman spectra of the obtained samples in Figure 2b, two main Raman peaks are observed, the first two peaks at 1376 and 1600 cm<sup>−</sup>1 are ascribed to the defective/ disordered carbon and aromatic carbon, respectively. Two weak peaks for HsGDY/Cu3Pd-750 and HsGDY-750 at 2216 cm<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> correspond to acetylenic bonds (the section closed by the dotted red rectangle in Figure 2b), suggesting the formation of acetylene linkages between two ethynyl groups of 1,3,5-Triethynylbenzene (TEB) monomer. All FT-IR spectra and Raman spectra investigation results are in good line with that of pristine

HsGDY (Figures S7 and S8, Supporting Information) and the previous reports. [30,32] However, as for rGO-supported Cu<sub>3</sub>Pd nanocomposites without HsGDY (rGO/Cu<sub>3</sub>Pd) obtained by annealing at 750 °C in N<sub>2</sub> atmosphere, no peak is observed at around 2210 cm<sup>-1</sup> except for two peaks at 1376 and 1600 cm<sup>-1</sup>. Such results demonstrate the successful formation of the large *π*-conjugation system cross-links aromatic rings with acetylenic bonds in HsGDY/Cu<sub>3</sub>Pd-750 and HsGDY-750.

As shown in Figure 2c, the high-resolution C 1s XPS spectra reveal the C 1s peaks can be deconvoluted into three subpeaks, corresponding to three distinct carbon species for HsGDY/Cu<sub>3</sub>Pd-750 and HsGDY-750, i.e., C–C (sp²), C–C (sp), and C=O. However, there are only two carbon species, C–C (sp²) and C=O observed for the rGO/Cu<sub>3</sub>Pd nanocomposites, indicating the synthetic HsGDY/Cu<sub>3</sub>Pd-750 and HsGDY-750 products have both sp and sp² hybridized carbon. Noticeably, comparing with HsGDY-750 and rGO/Cu<sub>3</sub>Pd, the binding energy of C–C (sp²) in HsGDY/Cu<sub>3</sub>Pd-750 is shifted toward lower energy, which suggests the stronger interaction at HsGDY-Cu<sub>3</sub>Pd interface than that derived from rGO-Cu<sub>3</sub>Pd interface. Accordingly, the binding energies of Cu–Pd and Pd–C display

the definite positive shift with the respect to the negative shift of the binding energy of C–C (sp²) for HsGDY/Cu<sub>3</sub>Pd-750. Such changes in binding energy suggest the strong coupling interaction between metallic Cu<sub>3</sub>Pd nanoalloy and HsGDY and, thus, the strong electron transfer between HsGDY and Cu<sub>3</sub>Pd nanoalloy, which might play an important role in the improvement of the electrocatalytic activity.

To determine whether the as-prepared products can act as the highly efficient ORR electrocatalysts in alkaline solution, the cycle voltammograms (CV) measurements were conducted in  $N_2/O_2$ -saturated KOH solution to evaluate the electrocatalytic activities of the catalysts achieved at the different temperatures. Among them, HsGDY/Cu<sub>3</sub>Pd-750 catalyst exhibits a superior electrocatalytic ORR activity to HsGDY/Cu<sub>3</sub>Pd-600 and HsGDY/Cu<sub>3</sub>Pd-900, in terms of the potential of cathodic peak and the peak current density (Figures S9–S11, Supporting Information). Therefore, the optimal heat treatment condition is defined to be 750 °C in the presence of  $N_2$ . The CV test results in **Figure 3**a also reveal a more positive oxygen reduction potential and a larger peak current density for HsGDY/Cu<sub>3</sub>Pd-750 catalyst, comparing with rGO/Cu<sub>3</sub>Pd

catalyst and HsGDY-750 catalyst. Additionally, from rotating disk electrode (RDE) measurements (Figure 3b and Figures S12-S14, Supporting Information), the excellent electrocatalytic ORR performance of HsGDY/Cu<sub>3</sub>Pd-750 is featured by the positive half-wave potential ( $E_{1/2} = 0.870 \text{ V}$ ), which is much higher than those of rGO/Cu<sub>3</sub>Pd ( $E_{1/2} = 0.835V$ ) and HsGDY-750 ( $E_{1/2} = 0.833$  V), and remarkably surpasses the state-ofthe-art Pt/C catalyst ( $E_{1/2} = 0.859$  V). Moreover, Tafel slope of  $55.1~\text{mV}~\text{dec}^{-1}$  for  $\text{HsGDY/Cu}_3\text{Pd-750}$  is the smallest than that of other samples, highlighting the outstanding catalytic ORR activity of HsGDY/Cu<sub>3</sub>Pd-750 (Figure 3c). Additionally, HsGDY/ Cu<sub>3</sub>Pd-750 catalyst exhibits the highest kinetic current density  $(j_k)$  of 57.7 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> at 0.75 V (Figure 3i), which far outperforms those of rGO/Cu3Pd catalyst (15.2 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>), HsGDY-750 catalyst (10.4 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>) and Pt/C catalyst (15.8 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>). This is an obvious indication for the rapid kinetics of HsGDY/ Cu<sub>3</sub>Pd-750 catalyst. It should be noted that the annealed GO nanosheets (rGO-750) without Cu<sub>3</sub>Pd nanoalloys shows a very poor electrocatalytic activity toward ORR (Figure S15, Supporting Information) and removing Cu<sub>3</sub>Pd nanoalloy from HsGDY/Cu<sub>3</sub>Pd-750 by aqua regia etching (HsGDY/Cu<sub>3</sub>Pd-750E) results in evidently electrocatalytic performance degradation (Figures S16 and S17, Supporting Information). Although rGO/Cu<sub>3</sub>Pd catalyst without HsGDY displays a relatively good electrocatalytic activity, it is far beneath that of HsGDY/Cu<sub>3</sub>Pd-750 catalyst (Figure S19, Supporting Information). Furthermore, the amount of Cu and Pd precursors was reduced by half to fabricate another HsGDY-Cu<sub>3</sub>Pd catalyst system (denoted as HsGDY/Cu<sub>3</sub>Pd-H) with a lower loading mass of Cu<sub>3</sub>Pd nanoalloy than that of HsGDY/Cu<sub>3</sub>Pd-750 catalyst. LSV test results witness the inferior electrocatalytic activity of HsGDY/Cu<sub>3</sub>Pd-H to that of HsGDY/Cu<sub>3</sub>Pd-750 (Figures S18 and S19, Supporting Information). As described above results, it is confirmed that both HsGDY and Cu<sub>3</sub>Pd nanoalloy are indispensable for the outstanding ORR activity of HsGDY/Cu<sub>3</sub>Pd-750 catalyst.

The electrochemical kinetics of the as-prepared catalysts were assessed by RDE polarization curves achieved at different rotations rates (Figure 3d). The linearity of the Koutecky-Levich (K-L) plots and the fitted lines reveal the first-order ORR kinetics over the concentration of dissolved O2 and the identical electron transfer number (n) at the different potentials (Figure 3e). The value of electron transfer number (n) is calculated in the range 4.0 to 4.1 at 0.3-0.6 V, which is similar to the commercial Pt/C catalyst (Figure S14, Supporting Information) and very close to the theoretical value, suggesting a 4e pathway of ORR process.[35-38] However, after freeing HsGDY and Cu<sub>3</sub>Pd nanoalloy from the catalysts, rGO-750 and HsGDY/ Cu<sub>3</sub>Pd-750E catalysts exhibit low electrocatalytic activities with an electron transfer number less than 4 (Figures S15 and S17, Supporting Information). These results further demonstrate that HsGDY and Cu<sub>3</sub>Pd nanoalloy are essential for the excellent electrocatalytic ORR activity of HsGDY/Cu<sub>3</sub>Pd-750. The strong interaction between HsGDY and Cu<sub>3</sub>Pd nanoalloy most likely causes synergistic effect that is highly efficient to facilitate the electrochemical ORR process.

The ORR electrochemical catalytic pathways were studied by the rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) tests (Figure 3f and Figure S20, Supporting Information). The average  $H_2O_2$  yield of  $\approx$ 2% for  $HsGDY/Cu_3Pd-750$  that is lower than that of

commercial Pt/C catalyst over the potential range from 0.2to 0.8 V. The calculated *n* is about 3.95 that suggests 4e transfer process occurred on HsGDY/Cu3Pd-750 (Figure 3e), which is the same at that of commercial Pt/C catalyst and in good agreement with the result achieved from the K–L plots. The long-term stability of HsGDY/Cu3Pd-750 was assessed by the chronoamperometric response at 0.6 V for 60 000 s in the O2-saturated KOH solution. As shown in Figure 3g, HsGDY/ Cu3Pd-750 catalyst gives a very stable electrocatalytic activity toward ORR, a slight degradation of current density (6.8%), while Pt/C catalyst and rGO/Cu3Pd catalyst exhibit the relatively larger current loss, corresponding to 20% and 33.7%, respectively. LSV curves obtained at 1600 rpm in O2-saturated KOH solution show a slightly negative shift of 9 mV for HsGDY/ Cu3Pd-750 after continuous 2000 CV cycles (Figure 3h).

Based on the above investigation on the as-prepared samples on the ORR, HsGDY/Cu3Pd-750 catalyst stands out from all the other as-prepared catalysts, in terms of the half-wave potential and kinetic current density, along with long-term stability, which is better than the state-of-the-art Pt/C catalyst and the most reported electrocatalysts so far (Figure 3i, Figure S19 and Table S2, Supporting Information). The large current density of HsGDY/Cu3Pd-750 is ascribed to rGO nanosheets with highly electrical conductivity, it provides HsGDY-supported Cu3Pd nanoalloy with nanomat to rapidly shuttles charge between electrode and catalyst surface. More importantly, the excellent electrochemical ORR activity of HsGDY/Cu3Pd-750 is most likely attributed to the synergistic effect derived from the strong coupling interaction between HsGDY and Cu3Pd nanoalloy,[26,28] which not only modifies the electronic configuration of HsGDY/ Cu3Pd-750 nanojunction for facilitating electrochemical oxygen catalysis, but firmly chelates Cu3Pd nanoalloys and allows them to free from agglomeration, resulting in the long-term stability. This finding is further validated by the morphological

investigation on HsGY/Cu3Pd-750 catalyst after the long-term stability test (Figure S21, Supporting Information).

To elucidate the synergistic effect induced by the strong interaction, the spin-polarized density function theory (DFT) calculations were used to model the ORR reactions catalyzed by HsGDY, Cu3Pd nanoalloy (Cu3Pd), HsGDY-Cu3Pd and the sandwich-like HsGDY-Cu3Pd-graphene, respectively, to understand the detailed mechanisms (**Figure 4** and Figures S22–S25, Supporting Information). A small Cu6Pd8 cluster which is derived from crystalline Cu3Pd with Pd exposed on the surface was first designed to interact with HsGDY. As shown by the comparison of atomic configurations, at the HsGDY-Cu3Pd heterojunction, CC bond lengths adjacent to benzene rings are elongated from 1.23 to 1.26 Å and 1.28 Å, and bond angles of 180° are turned to 157° and 162° (Figure 4a), indicating the weakening of π conjugation acetylenic linkages. Both the change in CC bond lengths and the structural distortion evidently demonstrate the strong interaction between HsGDY and Cu3Pd. A larger Cu36Pd27 cluster combining with HsGDY was selected to further study the synergistic effect induced by this strong interaction on the catalytic activity of HsGY-Cu3Pd catalyst system (Figure 4b). The calculated free energies for the ORR reaction intermediates \*OO, OOH, \*O, and \*OH in Figure 4c and Figure S23 (Supporting Information) showed that the pristine HsGDY is less reactive due to the very high adsorption free energy for the initial step of ORR reactions (5.73 eV). In contrast, the adsorption of \*OO on the Cu3Pd nanoparticles is much easier with an adsorption free energy of 1.79 eV. However, the adsorption of \*OH is very strong exothermic at −2.19 eV, which makes its further reaction to H2O and desorption very difficult, indicating that the Cu3Pd nanoparticles are not a good active site for the ORR reaction (Figure 4c and Figure S25, Supporting Information). However, the combination of Cu3Pd and HsGDY significantly changes the adsorption properties with adsorption free energies for \*OO and \*OH are lowered at 3.87 and −0.24 eV, respectively (Figures S25 and Figures S27–S29, Supporting Information). Therefore, ORR reaction is significantly enhanced by facilitating the adsorption of O2 and the desorption of OH<sup>−</sup>, achieving the synergistic effect. Further investigation of differential charge density of HsGDY-Cu3Pd shows that the enhanced performance is mainly attributed to the weakening of π conjugation by the strong interaction between Cu3Pd and CC bond in HsGDY as shown in Figure 4d. Besides, some electrons are accumulated on one C atoms of CC bond and some electrons are concomitantly depleted on the other C atom of CC bond. This asymmetric electron distribution on two carbon atoms of acetylenic linkage induced by Cu3Pd weakens the p–p orbitals of shoulder-toshoulder π conjugation, enhancing the activity of sp-hybridized CC bonds. This result is responsible for the synergistic

effect between HsGDY and Cu3Pd nanoalloy and the excellent catalytic ORR activity of HsGDY/Cu3Pd-750. Furthermore, rGO serving as nanomat benefits the effect because its high conduc-

tivity improves the overall electrical conductivity of catalyst. Considering the outstanding electrocatalytic performance of HsGDY/Cu3Pd-750 toward oxygen electrochemistry, a conventional Zn–air battery was engineered to explore practical application of HsGDY/Cu3Pd-750 in energy storage and conversion devices. The commercial Pt/C-IrO2 cathode was also used as benchmark for comparison. The assembled Zn–air battery achieves an open-circuit potential of 1.44 V that can power an electroluminescent panel (**Figure 5**a). The typical discharging and charging polarization curves reveal a gap of charge–discharge voltage of 1.22 V for HsGDY/Cu3Pd-750 at 50 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> , lower than that of Pt/C-IrO2 electrode (1.36 V) as shown in Figure 5b, suggesting a better charge–discharge performance of HsGDY/Cu3Pd-750 cathode than that of Pt/C-IrO2 cathode. In addition, HsGDY/Cu3Pd-750 cathode gives a high current density of 52.9 mA cm−<sup>2</sup> at a voltage of 1.0 V and a maximum power density of 115.3 mW cm−<sup>2</sup> , outperforming the commercial Pt/C-IrO2 cathode (22.7 and 98 mW cm−<sup>2</sup> , Figure 5c). The discharging tests at the different current densities demonstrate the superior rate performance of HsGDY/Cu3Pd-750 cathode, with the higher discharge voltages than the Pt/C-IrO2 cathode in all the cases, implying the expedited ORR kinetics and electrocatalytic performance of HsGDY/Cu3Pd-750 in good agreement with the electrochemical test results (Figure 5d). The cyclic stability of the as-assembled batteries was also evaluated at the current density of 10 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2 (Figure 5e). HsGDY/ Cu3Pd-750 cathode displays an initial charge–discharge voltage gap of 0.83 V, and after continuous 300 cycles corresponding to 55 h, no obvious change is observed in both charging and discharging, while the commercial Pt/C-IrO2 cathode exhibits a remarkable change in charge–discharge voltage just after 225 cycles (about 41 h). Therefore, HsGDY/Cu3Pd-750 catalyst with the excellent electrocatalytic oxygen performance demonstrates the great application potential as air electrode material in Zn–air batteries.

In summary, we have developed a hydrogen-substituted graphdiyne supported metal system through in situ growth of Cu3Pd nanoalloy on the surface of HsGDY by calcination at high temperature in N2 atmosphere. The strong HsGDY-Cu3Pd interaction is successfully engineered due to the unique chelating ability of acetylenic linkages in HsGDY. As a result, the catalytic ORR activity of HsGDY-Cu3Pd system is significantly improved. The optimal HsGDY/Cu3Pd-750 catalyst exhibits excellent electrocatalytic ORR performance with the admirable half-wave potential of 0.870 V and the impressive kinetic current density of 57.7 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> , which far outperform the state-of-the-art Pt/C catalyst (0.859 V and 15.8 mA cm−<sup>2</sup> ). The distinguished catalytic activity is further highlighted by the zinc–air battery measurements. Experimental and DFT investigations reveal that the strong HsGDY-Cu3Pd interaction induces the change of CC bond length and the structural distortion of flat HsGDY surface, which generates the asymmetric electron distribution on two carbon atoms of acetylenic linkage. This weakens the p–p orbitals of shoulder-to-shoulder π conjugation, eventually enhancing the activity of the HsGDY-Cu3Pd catalyst system. GDY has been considered as a novel 2D carbon allotrope with large specific surface area, which makes it hold great potential for supporting metal guest atoms and results in more sufficient interaction. Therefore, exploration of the 2D

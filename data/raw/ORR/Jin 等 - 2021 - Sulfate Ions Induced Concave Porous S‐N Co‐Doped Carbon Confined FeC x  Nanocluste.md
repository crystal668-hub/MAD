**To improve the catalytic activity of the catalysts, it is key to intensifying the intrinsic activity of active sites or increasing the exposure of accessible active sites. In this work, an efficient oxygen reduction electrocatalyst is designed that confines plentiful FeC***x* **nanoclusters with Fe-N4 sites in a concave porous S-N co-doped carbon matrix, readily accessible for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Sulfate ions react with the carbon derived from ZIF-8 at high temperatures, leading to the shrinkage of the carbon framework and then forming a concave structure with abundant macropores and mesopores with S incorporation. Such an architecture promotes the exposure of active sites and accelerates remote mass transfer. As a result, the catalyst (Fe/S-NC) with a large number of C-S-C, Fe-N4, and FeC***x* **nanoclusters presents impressive ORR activity and stability. In alkaline media, the half-wave potential of the best catalyst (Fe/S2-NC) is 0.91 V, which far exceeds that of commercial platinum carbon (0.85 V), while in acidic media the half-wave potential reaches 0.784 V, comparable to platinum carbon (0.812 V). Furthermore, for the zinc-air battery, the outstanding peak power density of Fe/S2-NC (170 mW cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> ) superior to platinum carbon (108 mW cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> ) also highlights its great application potential.**

## **1. Introduction**

Among the catalysts currently used in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), platinum (Pt)-based catalysts are the most active electrocatalysts,[1,2] but the high cost and scarcity hinder their large-scale application. Therefore, a lot of work has been done on seeking high efficiency and lowcost non-noble metal-based catalysts, such as metal carbides, oxides, and nitrides, etc.[3–5] Among such catalysts, the most prominent is the iron-based carbon material.[6–10] Nevertheless, the acidic-oxygen reduction activity of existing non-noble metal catalysts is not sufficient to replace Pt catalysts in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs)/metal-air batteries.

For electrocatalysts, the activity breakthrough is embodied in two core aspects, namely increasing the number of exposed active sites and boosting the intrinsic activity of the active sites for the catalyst.[11,12] Increasing the accessible active

sites can be achieved by enhancing the number of active sites, enlarging the specific surface area of the catalyst, reducing the particle size of metal particles, and adjusting the pore size of carbon materials.[13–17] As reported, the sites hosted by the micropores on the catalyst surface are more actively involved in oxygen reduction.[18,19] In addition, the mesopores or macropores are conducive to the opening of the catalyst structure and promote the utilization of the sites inside the carbon matrix.[20,21] Polystyrene spheres and silica are commonly used as templates for making pores.[22–24] For example, Shui et al. coated ZIF-8 with mesoporous SiO2, not only obtained more mesopores, but also successfully prepared a concave Fe-N-C catalyst with high density active sites.[25] However, the inconvenient point is that both polystyrene spheres and silica require additional removal steps.

As for activating the intrinsic activity of the catalytic sites, the key lies in regulating the electronic structure of the active site, mainly through heteroatoms doping or/and defects construction.[26–28] Since heteroatom doping is also equivalent to introducing defects in the carbon matrix, various types of heteroatoms such as N, S, P, B are used to activate the carbon matrix or modify the electronic structure of the active site.[29–31] When doped with S, the carbon usually contains two configurations,

**www.advancedsciencenews.com**

**www.small-journal.com**

C-S-C or/and SOx-C, which can produce electron-donating or electron-withdrawing effects on the carbon plane.[32] Both of the effects would excite the carbon structure by changing the strength of the electronic effect from the carbon plane to Fe atoms, thereby regulating Fe-N*x* sites.

Herein, to achieve one-step pore formation and N, S doping, ZIF-8 is used as carbon and nitrogen source, FeSO4 is used as iron source, and ZnSO4 is added to provide SO4 <sup>2</sup><sup>−</sup> ions as sulfur source. Here, sulfate ion can decompose and react with carbon at high temperatures, finally forming a concave N, S co-doped Fe-based carbon material with multi-mesoporous. After adjusting the amount of sulfate ions, the as-prepared catalyst can achieve a half-wave potential of 0.91 V in alkaline solutions and 0.784 V in acidic solutions, with excellent stability. When used to assemble zinc-air batteries, the peak power density can reach 170 mW cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> , far better than that of commercial platinum carbon (108 mW cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> ).

## **2. Results and Discussion**

#### **2.1. Morphology and Structure Characterization**

The preparation process of Fe/S-NC by combining wet chemical methods and high temperature heat treatments, is pictured in **Scheme 1**. After the formation of ZIF-8 crystals, sulfates (FeSO4, ZnSO4) are added into the solution system, and the precursor is synthesized by fully adsorbing iron ions and sulfate ions on the surface of ZIF-8 (named as ZIF-8@S). Then, with the carbonization of ZIF-8, the decomposition of sulfate ions, and the anchoring and trapping of other atoms by the carbon matrix at high temperatures, a porous carbon material co-doped with Fe, N, and S (Fe/S-NC) is obtained.

Since zinc sulfate provides zinc ions and continues to coordinate with 2-methylimidazole on the surface of ZIF-8, the crystal size of ZIF-8@S is slightly larger than that of ZIF-8 (Figure S1, Supporting Information), but the crystal structure remains unchanged, as shown by XRD patterns in Figure S2, Supporting Information. At the same time, as the amount of zinc sulfate increases, the amount of sulfate ion adsorbed on the precursor also increases significantly, which can be judged by the peak intensity of the characteristic absorption peak of sulfate ions in the FTIR spectra of all precursors (Figure S3, Supporting Information). At high temperatures, Fe ions and sulfate ions further reacted with ZIF-8, causing depressions of the carbonized surface by consumption of carbon and generation of gas, and resulting in formation of the porous concave. In fact, the sunken carbon surface would increase the contact surface with the electrolyte, and more pores expedite mass transport, thus facilitating the reaction process. However, excessive carbon consumption causes serious shrinkage of the entire carbon structure and agglomeration of iron, which catalyzes the formation of carbon nanotubes,[33] as shown in Figure S4, Supporting Information.

Through the transmission electron microscope (TEM) images, the NC with a dense carbon structure transformed by ZIF-8 presents a flat surface (**Figure 1**a). On the contrary, Fe/S2-NC appears a loose carbon frame with clearly visible concave surfaces (Figure 1b). Furthermore, the state of Fe atoms in Fe/S2-NC can be observed by the aberration correction high angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscope (AC HADDF-STEM). Monodisperse Fe atoms (orange circles in Figure 1c) and aggregated Fe species (orange arrows in Figure 1c) are co-embedded in the concave carbon surface. The aggregated Fe species present the nanocluster state with an average size of 2.3 nm (Figure 1d). HADDF-STEM EDS mapping further shows that Fe is uniformly distributed and accompanied by tiny agglomerations corresponding to Fe-based nanoclusters. The other elements C, N, O, and S are also uniformly distributed on surface of the carbon matrix (Figure 1e).

To further figure out the actual coordination state of Fe in Fe/S2-NC, Mössbauer spectrum test was performed on Fe/S2-NC. Fe Mössbauer spectroscopy of Fe/S2-NC demonstrates the co-existence of Fe-N4 and FeC*x* (**Figure 2**a, fitting parameters in Table S1, Supporting Information),[34,35] corresponding to monodisperse Fe atoms and Fe-based nanoclusters

in Figure 1c. Furthermore, the XRD pattern of Fe/S2-NC has no obvious Fe diffraction peak (Figure S5, Supporting Information), implying that the formed FeC*x* nanocluster is very small, consistent with the observed results of AC HADDF-STEM (Figure 1d). Notably, the (002) carbon peak in the XRD pattern of the sample prepared with more sulfate ions shifts to small angle (Figure S5, Supporting Information), possibly due to the expansion of the carbon lattice caused by sulfur atom doping.

The pore structure of Fe/S-NC samples was collected by the nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherm. All samples are prominent in the mesopores and macropores, and the Fe/ S2-NC hysteresis loops are wider, indicating that there are more mesopores and larger pore volume (Figure 2b). Obviously, the pore size distribution curves also prove that the mesopore distribution of Fe/S2-NC is broader (Figure 2c). Usually, micropores are beneficial to the distribution of active sites. More importantly, the abundant mesopores and macropores produced by the reaction of sulfate ions with carbon at high temperatures greatly facilitate the exposure of active sites and remote mass transfer. Therefore, this continuous pore structure in which micropores, mesopores, and macropores coexist can donate the potential for amplified catalyst activity.

Since defects would be induced by pores and heteroatom doping in the sample, the degree of graphitization and defects of the sample were then characterized by Raman spectroscopy. The peaks at 1320 cm−<sup>1</sup> and 1590 cm−<sup>1</sup> in the Raman spectra correspond to carbon defects (D band) and graphitization (G band), respectively.[36,37] The analysis results show that the *I*D/*I*<sup>G</sup> increases first and then decreases with the increase of sulfate ion content in the preparation process (Figure S6, Supporting Information). This is because appropriate sulfate ions promote the increase in pore size and S doping in the sample at high temperature, resulting in an increase in defects. However, when large amount of sulfate ions are used, excessive carbon **www.advancedsciencenews.com www.small-journal.com**

consumption leads to the serious aggregation of iron atoms, and the formed FeC*x* nanoparticles can not only facilitate the graphitization of carbon, but also catalyze the formation of carbon nanotubes. Therefore, the increased *I*D/*I*G value is attributable to the expansion of pore size and the increase of S doping content, while the decreased *I*D/*I*G value is caused by the carbon nanotubes formed in the catalyst. And the improvement of appropriate defects is actually beneficial to the improvement of catalytic activity.

To estimate the surface composition and valence of Fe/S-NC nanostructures, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was further employed. After fitting, the N1s highresolution XPS spectra of all samples are divided into three nitrogen types: pyridinic nitrogen (398.1 ± 0.1 eV), pyrrolic nitrogen (400 ± 0.1 eV), graphitic nitrogen (401.1 ± 0.1 eV)[38,39] (Figure S7, Supporting Information). It shows that the limiting current density during the oxygen reduction process is determined by the graphitic nitrogen content, and the onset potential is related to the pyridinic nitrogen content,[40] while pyridinic nitrogen forms the active site of ORR.[41,42] Moreover, iron atoms tend to coordinate with pyridinic nitrogen to form more favorable active sites for ORR.[43,44] Consequently, the high content of pyridinic nitrogen and graphitic nitrogen plays a crucial role in improving the ORR activity. The pyridinic nitrogen and graphitic nitrogen content of each sample are summarized in Figure 2d. For Fe/S0-NC, Fe/S1-NC, and Fe/S2- NC, the content of pyridinic nitrogen increases gradually, while the content of graphitic nitrogen decreases gradually. As shown in Figure 2e, both pyridinic nitrogen and graphitic nitrogen are located in the carbon hexatomic ring where the former is in the edge position, while the latter is in the middle position. Accordingly, when more mesopores are formed, the graphitic nitrogen in the intermediate position can be made into the edge position (Figure 2f), thereby increasing the pyridinic nitrogen content. Nevertheless, in Fe/S3-NC, its graphitic nitrogen increases compared with Fe/S2-NC, owing to the formation of carbon nanotubes in Fe/S3-NC. The S-fitted peak curves of all samples prove that the S atoms provided by sulfate ions were doped into the carbon structure, which can be divided into thiophene S (C-S-C) and oxides S (SOx-C)[31,45] (Figure S8, Supporting Information). C-S-C is known to be independent oxygen reduction active sites in S carbon-doped materials,[46] and the electron withdrawing effect of SOx-C is beneficial to enhance the ORR activity of Fe sites.[33] Therefore, the increase in the doping amount of S contributes to the catalytic reaction of oxygen reduction, especially when the proportion of SOx-C is relatively abundant (Figure 2g). Although a small amount of Fe-S is produced in Fe/S1-NC and Fe/S2-NC, the effect is weak due to the too small ratio. Unfortunately, a much strong Fe-S peak appears in Fe/S3-NC, which is incurred by excessive S sources. And the excessive occupation of Fe by S results in the decrease of active site Fe-N4 or FeC*x* nanoclusters as well as S sites.

## **2.2. ORR Performance**

The electrocatalytic performance of the as-synthesized catalysts for oxygen reduction was measured by a rotating disk electrode (RDE) and a rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE). The ORR activity of the catalysts was first investigated in 0.1 m KOH electrolytes. As the amount of sulfate ions increases, the onset potential (*E*onset) and half-wave potential (*E*1/2) of the catalyst increases from 1.002 and 0.879 V to 1.031 and 0.903 V, respectively, and then further to 1.043 and 0.910 V (**Figure 3**a,b;

**www.small-journal.com**

**Figure 3.** ORR performance in 0.1 m KOH: a) LSV curves; b) onset and half-wave potential results; c) Tafel slope; d) H2O2 yield and electron transfer number of Fe/S2-NC and 20% Pt/C; e) chronoamperometric stability test and f) chronoamperometric methanol resistance test of Fe/S2-NC and 20% Pt/C.

Figures S9 and S10, Supporting Information), achieving optimal ORR catalytic activity. And the ORR activity of Fe/S2-NC is not only exceedingly better than the activity of commercial Pt/C (*E*onset: 0.965 V, *E*1/2: 0.85 V), but also better than most nonnoble metal oxygen reduction catalysts (Table S2, Supporting Information). However, this activity improvement trend does not persist to the catalyst with the highest S doping amount. As a result, the moderately increased amount of sulfate ions first increases the pore size of the catalyst, the amount of S doping, and the content of pyridinic nitrogen and graphitic nitrogen, promoting the gradual improvement of catalyst activity. But continuously increasing the amount of sulfate ions leads to a large amount of iron agglomeration (orange box in Figure S11, Supporting Information) and the formation of FeSx (orange circle in Figure S11, Supporting Information) during the carbonization process, which violates the principle of increasing the number of catalytic active sites.

This changing pattern is also reflected in the Tafel slope, and Fe/S2-NC with the lowest Tafel slope has the fastest reaction kinetics (Figure 3c and Figure S12, Supporting Information). Additionally, Fe/S2-NC has a low H2O2 yield, indicating that the ORR is carried out through an apparent four-electron pathway (Figure 3d), accordant with the electron transfer number calculated at different linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) speeds (Figure S13, Supporting Information). Additionally, the current density of Fe/S2-NC can maintain 90.01% after 10 h chronoamperometric test under limit current potential (Figure 3e). In comparison, the current of commercial Pt/C drops to 64.82% after 6 h of test. Meanwhile, the half-wave potential of Fe/S2-NC is almost unchanged after the accelerated test with 5000 cyclic voltammetry (CV) circles (Figure S14, Supporting Information), indicating that Fe/S2-NC has good stability. Besides, by adding methanol solution during the chronoamperometric test, the methanol resistance stability of the catalyst can be evaluated by means of the change of the relative current density. As shown in Figure 3f, the current density of Fe/S2-NC only fluctuates slightly when methanol is injected and the total current does not change, while the current density of Pt/C decreases precipitously when methanol is injected, and cannot be restored to its initial current. Moreover, even if Fe/S2-NC was accelerated for 5000 CV cycles in the mixed electrolytes containing 0.1 m KOH and 0.1 m methanol, its oxygen reduction activity still has no obvious decrease (Figure S14, Supporting Information), revealing excellent stability against methanol for Fe/S2-NC.

In 0.5 m H2SO4 electrolytes, the activity trends of all prepared catalysts are similar to those in alkaline solutions. Both LSV testing results and the calculated Tafel slope display that Fe/S2-NC with the optimal performance in alkaline media also has higher activity than other prepared catalysts in acidic media (**Figure 4**a–c and Figures S15–S17, Supporting Information), manifesting that the advantageous factors stimulated by sulfate ions at high temperatures for the target catalyst are also suitable under acid conditions. The half-wave potential of Fe/S2-NC is 0.784 V, only 28 mV lower than commercial Pt/C (*E*1/2: 0.812 V). The amount of hydrogen peroxide produced by Fe/S2-NC during oxygen reduction is similar to that of Pt/C, and the electron transfer number is close to 4 (Figure 4d and Figure S18, Supporting Information). These results suggest that the mixing path of two-electron path and four-electron path occurs simultaneously in the ORR process of Fe/S2-NC catalysts, and is dominated by four-electron path. Although the activity of Fe/S2-NC under acidic conditions is close to that of Pt/C, it has obviously high stability compared to Pt/C. In the stability test, the current density of Fe/S2-NC keeps 80.05% of the initial value for 20 h, www.advancedsciencenews.com

ORR performance in 0.5 M  $H_2SO_4$ : a) LSV curves; b) onset and half-wave potential results; c) Tafel slope; d)  $H_2O_2$  yield and electron transfer number of Fe/S<sub>2</sub>-NC and 20% Pt/C; e) chronoamperometric stability test and f) chronoamperometric methanol resistance test of Fe/S<sub>2</sub>-NC and 20% Pt/C.

while Pt/C drops sharply to 77.17% of the initial value after only 5 h (Figure 4f). At the same time,  $Fe/S_2$ -NC also has very stable methanol tolerance in acid conditions (Figure 4e).

#### 2.3. Zinc-Air Battery Application

Based on the good ORR electrocatalytic activity of Fe/S<sub>2</sub>-NC, a zinc-air battery (ZAB) with Fe/S2-NC as the cathode material was assembled (Figure 5a). As shown in Figure 5b, the open circuit voltage of the aqueous electrolyte ZAB fabricated with Fe/S2-NC is as high as 1.51 V, much better than commercial platinum carbon. The polarization curves in Figure 5c show that Fe/S<sub>2</sub>-NC possesses a higher onset potential and current density, which is consistent with the half-cell test results in alkaline electrolytes. The power density of Fe/S<sub>2</sub>-NC is always higher than 20% Pt/C under the same current density, and the peak power density of Fe/S<sub>2</sub>-NC can reach 170 mW cm<sup>-2</sup>, while the peak power density of 20% Pt/C is only 108 mW cm<sup>-2</sup>. Further comparing the discharge of Fe/S2-NC battery and 20% Pt/C battery, it can be found that Fe/S2-NC always output higher discharge voltage at current densities of 5 and 20 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> (Figure 5d and Figure S19, Supporting Information). Especially, when Fe/S2-NC and RuO2 were mixed as the cathode of a ZAB for long-term galvanostatic charge-discharge testing at 5 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, its discharge performance can be maintained quite stable even after a high-voltage charging process (Figure 5e). Meaningfully, the all-solid-state ZAB with Fe/S<sub>2</sub>-NC as the cathode material exhibits an open circuit voltage of up to 1.43 V, and three solid-state batteries connected in series can light up four parallel small LEDs as shown in Figure 5f. The test results of zinc-air batteries fully demonstrate that Fe/S2-NC has efficient spontaneous ORR capability.

#### 2.4. Activity Origin Analysis for Fe/S2-NC

Even though the oxygen reduction activity of Fe/S2-NC is high under acidic conditions, it still has a large gap compared to its activity under alkaline conditions. For this reason, Fe/S<sub>2</sub>-NC was processed with 0.5 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> for 24 h to explore the reasons for the gap in ORR activity. Inductively coupled plasma (ICP) emission spectroscopy testing result shows that the Fe content of Fe/S2-NC is greatly reduced from 6.18 wt% to 2.77 wt% with acid-etching, indicating that the acid-etching process removed most of the exposed acid-soluble FeCx nanoclusters in Fe/S2-NC. Then, LSV curves disclose that the oxygen reduction activity of Fe/S2-NC after acid-etching is significantly reduced under alkaline conditions. When Fe/S2-NC is further poisoned by KSCN in alkaline media, its oxygen reduction activity continues to be greatly reduced due to some Fe-N<sub>4</sub> sites being blocked (Figure S20, Supporting Information). But under acidic conditions, the oxygen reduction activity of Fe/S<sub>2</sub>-NC after acid-etching is almost the same as before acid-etching (Figure S21, Supporting Information). In view of the fact that the catalytic reaction occurs almost on the surface of the active sites, the concave porous structure undoubtedly facilitates the exposure of a large number of Fe-N<sub>4</sub> sites and FeC<sub>x</sub> nanoclusters, jointly promoting the superior performance of Fe/S2-NC under alkaline conditions. However, these exposed acid-soluble FeC, nanoclusters under acidic conditions would be dissolved and lead to loss of ORR active sites, so the residual FeCx nanoclusters wrapped in the carbon layer, further exposed acid-resistant Fe-N<sub>4</sub> sites, and a large number of sites provided by S and N doping together contribute to the comparable ORR activity in acidic solutions.

#### 3. Conclusion

In summary, we innovatively utilized sulfate ions as sulfur source to construct a concave S and N-doped porous carbon matrix confined with FeC<sub>r</sub> nanoclusters and Fe-N<sub>4</sub> sites through one-step pyrolysis without further processing. Benefiting from the reaction of sulfate ions with carbon at high temperatures, it not only accelerates the shrinkage of the ZIF-8-derived carbon framework, but also promotes the formation of more mesopores and macropores on the carbon matrix. The concave surface provides a larger contact surface with the electrolyte, and the pores forward mass transport and the exposure of active sites. Consequently, under the synergistic catalysis of high concentration of accessible C-S-C, Fe-N<sub>4</sub>, and FeC<sub>x</sub> nanocluster sites, the as-prepared catalyst exhibits outstanding ORR activity and stability in both acidic and alkaline conditions, and even possesses a better performance in zinc-air batteries than the commercial platinum catalyst. This straightforward method of in situ S doping and pore formation with sulfate ions opens up a new direction for the development and design of costeffective non-noble metal oxygen reduction catalysts.

Synthesis of Fe@S-NC: 1.2~g Zn(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>·6H<sub>2</sub>O (4.12 mmol) and 2.649 g 2-methylimidazole (32.96 mmol) were respectively dissolved in 36 mL methanol solution, then the two solutions were mixed, stirred in a 35 °C water bath for 4 h. And then added 36 mL methanol solution containing 0.0934 g FeSO<sub>4</sub>·7H<sub>2</sub>O (0.34 mmol) and ZnSO<sub>4</sub>·7H<sub>2</sub>O, continued to stir for 4 h. The dosages of ZnSO<sub>4</sub>·7H<sub>2</sub>O were 0 g, 0.29 g (1.03 mmol), 0.58 g

Finally, the dried precursor was ground to powder and placed in a circulating  $N_2$  tube furnace at 900 °C for 3 h, the heating rate was 5 °C min<sup>-1</sup>. According to the amount of ZnSO<sub>4</sub>·7H<sub>2</sub>O (0 g, 0.29 g, 0.58 g, and 1.16 g), the final products obtained were named Fe@S<sub>0</sub>·NC, Fe@S<sub>1</sub>·NC, Fe@S<sub>2</sub>·NC, Fe@S<sub>3</sub>·NC.

Electrochemical Measurements: The electrochemical measurements were performed under the three-electrode (counter electrode, reference electrode, and working electrode) test system on the electrochemical workstation CHI 760E. In this work, carbon rod was used for counter electrode. Ag/AgCl electrode filled with saturated KCl was used as the reference electrode under alkaline conditions, and its standard electrode potential was 0.197 V and had been calibrated. A calibrated saturated calomel electrode (SCE) was used as the reference electrode under acidic conditions, and the standard electrode potential was 0.244 V. In order to facilitate the comparison between the catalyst activity in the work and the catalyst activity in other references, Nernst equation was used to convert the potential obtained under the Ag/AgCl electrode or the SCE electrode into the potential under the reversible hydrogen electrode. The working electrode was a RDE and a RRDE loaded with catalyst ink. Preparation of catalyst ink:5 mg of the as-prepared catalyst powder (3 mg commercial platinum carbon) was placed in a centrifuge tube of 1.5 mL capacity, then added 900 μL isopropanol, 100 μL ultrapure water, and 20 μL 5 wt.% Nafion, and sonicated for 20 min to reach a uniform ink state. Afterward, 20 µL of the as-synthesized catalyst ink was dropped on the working electrode and waited for it to air dry. For comparison, 6.5  $\mu L$  commercial platinum carbon ink was dropped on the working electrode. Before testing, it was necessary to pass high-purity N2 or O2 into the electrolyte for at least 20 min to ensure that the electrolyte was saturated with N2 or O2. The sweep rate of CV was 50 mV s<sup>-1</sup>. The LSV test used for ORR activity comparison was carried out at a rotate speed of 1600 rpm, the sweep speed was 10 mV s<sup>-1</sup>. And the LSV test used to calculate the electron transfer number was carried out under different rotate speeds. The different speeds selected in this work were 800, 1200, 1600, 2000, and 2400 rpm.

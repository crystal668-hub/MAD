**ABSTRACT:** Developing electrocatalysts with high activity and selectivity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) has attracted increasing interest in the past decades. The many imidazole residues located at the active site of cytochrome *c* oxidases (C*c*Os) play crucial roles in facilitating the selective reduction of dioxygen to water. As inspired by nature, we herein reported on the synthesis of CoIII corrole **1** hanged with a biologically relevant imidazolium group and its electrocatalytic ORR features in both acidic and alkaline solutions. Complex **1** is more active and selective than its imidazolium-free analogue for electrocatalytic four-electron ORR. Importantly, **1** displayed ORR activities with the halfwave potentials at *E*1/2 = 0.65 V versus RHE in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution and at *E*1/2 = 0.81 V versus RHE in 0.1 M KOH solution. This work presents a strategy to simultaneously improve catalytic ORR activity and selectivity by hanging a cationic imidazolium unit over molecular catalytic sites.

**KEYWORDS:** oxygen reduction reaction, cobalt corrole, electrostatic effect, molecular electrocatalysis, structure-function relationship.

## **INTRODUCTION**

Electrocatalytic ORR is a fundamental process in many new energy conversion techniques, such as fuel cells and metal-air batteries [1–5]. Developing cheap and efficient electrocatalysts for the reduction of O2 to water has attracted increasing interest in the past decades [6–18]. Recent efforts have led to the identification of a variety of molecular complexes of Mn [19–21], Fe [22– 28], Co [29–35], Ni [36–38], and Cu [39–43] as active ORR electrocatalysts. By studying these molecular catalysts, people have learned fundamental knowledge of the structure-function relationships [44–47], which are essential for the rational design and development of novel ORR electrocatalysts [47–52]. Despite these achievements, however, electrocatalysts with high activity and selectivity for the four-electron (4e− ) ORR are still required [53–57].

In nature, cytochrome *c* oxidases (C*c*Os) catalyze the reduction of O2 to water with high efficiency [48, 58, 59]. C*c*Os contain a Cu/heme active site for O2 binding and activation. The heme unit with a Fe porphyrin core structure is considered to stabilize high-valent Fe-oxo species, which are critical intermediates generated upon the O-O bond cleavage [60]. The Cu ion is suggested to provide an electron (in its CuI state) to reduce O2 and to bind with the resulting O2-adduct to form a FeIII-O-O-CuII μ-peroxo intermediate [61]. In addition to the Cu/heme active site, the amino acid residues located at the active site of C*c*Os play crucial roles in facilitating O2 binding and activation [58, 59, 62]. For example, the many imidazole residues can coordinate the Cu ion and may fine-tune the electrostatic environment of the active site. It is considered that the imidazole residues may be protonated under the

SPP full member in good standing.

physiological condition and the resulting cationic imidazolium unit can stabilize negatively charged O2-adduct and also improve the subsequent O-O bond cleavage. Although recent works using synthetic molecular catalysts have shown that appending cationic units at the second-coordination sphere can lead to improved activity and selectivity for electrocatalytic 4e− ORR [63–66], the effects of the appended biologically relevant imidazolium unit on ORR has been rarely investigated with artificial molecular catalysts.

We herein reported on the synthesis of CoIII corrole **1** (Fig. 1) hanged with a cationic imidazolium group and its electrocatalytic ORR features. Co corroles are active for catalytic ORR in both acidic and alkaline solutions. The trianionic corrole macrocycles are highly effective to stabilize metal ions in their high oxidation states [45, 48]. Instead of using an imidazole substituent, we appended an imidazolium group over the corrole plane because the imidazolium unit can provide a positive charge effect in both acidic and alkaline solutions. We showed that Co corrole **1** is more active and selective than its imidazolium-free analogue **2** for electrocatalytic 4e− ORR. For **1**, the ORR half-wave potentials at *E*1/2 = 0.65V versus RHE (reversible hydrogen electrode) in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution and at *E*1/2 = 0.81 V versus RHE in 0.1 M KOH solution are notable as compared with reported ORR molecular electrocatalysts. Therefore, this work shows the critical effects of the imidazolium unit on improving the ORR activity and selectivity in both acidic and alkaline solutions and underlines the benefits of molecular catalysts in studying the structure-function relationships.

## **RESULTS AND DISCUSSION**

Co corroles **1** and **2** were synthesized and characterized (Scheme S1 and S2). The identity and purity of complex **1** as a hexafluorophosphate salt were confirmed by 1 H NMR and high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS). The mass spectrum of **1** displayed an ion at a mass-tocharge ratio of 947.1024, which matched the calculated value of 947.1022 for the monocation of **1** (Fig. S3). The UV-vis spectrum of **1** displayed Soret bands at 345 and 410 nm and Q bands at 550 and 579 nm in acetonitrile (Fig. S8). We also synthesized the imidazolium-free analogue **2** (Figs. S7 and S9). Similar to **1**, the UV-vis spectrum of **2** displayed Soret bands at 438 nm and Q bands at 587 and 610 nm, indicating that the Co ions in **1** and **2** have very similar coordination and electronic structures. It is worth noting that the axial pyridines of Co corroles can dissociate upon the dissolution in polar solvents.

The redox features of **1** were first measured in dry acetonitrile containing 0.1 M Bu4NPF6. The cyclic voltammogram (CV) of **1** in acetonitrile under argon exhibited three quasi-reversible 1e− redox couples at *E*1/2 = 0.07, −0.59, and −1.80 V versus ferrocene (Fig. S10a), which can be attributed to the formal CoIV/CoIII, CoIII/CoII, and CoII/CoI redox couples, respectively. A similar CV was observed for **2**, showing three redox processes at *E*1/2 = 0.03 and −0.59, and −1.96V versus ferrocene (Fig. S10b). Notably, the redox potentials of the CoIV/CoIII and CoIII/ CoII couples of **1** are very close to those of **2**. However, the CoII/CoI redox potential of **1** displayed an anodic shift of 160 mV as compared to that of **2**. This difference in the CoII/CoI redox potential arises from the electrostatic interaction between the cationic imidazolium group and the Co ion of **1** [67]. It is worth noting that the difference of the CoII/CoI redox potentials of **1** and **2** will have negligible influence on their electrocatalytic ORR features, because, for Co corroles, ORR usually occurs at more positive potentials [29, 45].

We then loaded **1** and **2** onto carbon nanotubes (CNTs) for ORR electrocatalysis in aqueous solutions. The resulting hybrids **1**@CNT and **2**@CNT were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Figs. 2a and 2b, respectively), showing the absence of any aggregated particles of Co corrole molecules on CNTs with average diameters of 20–30 nm. For comparison, the SEM analysis of unmodified CNTs was provided in Fig. S11. In addition, the homogeneous dispersion of Co on CNTs was confirmed by elemental mapping analysis (Figs. S12- S15). Moreover, the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra of **1**@CNT and **2**@CNT showed signals attributed to Co 2p, F 1s, and N 1s (Fig. 2c), confirming the successful loading of the Co corrole molecules on CNTs in these hybrids. Importantly, the Co 2p XPS signals observed in **1**@CNT and **2**@CNT are very similar to each other (Fig. S16) and match those of free Co corrole molecules (Fig. 2c), indicating that (1) the electronic structures of the Co ions in **1**@CNT and **2**@CNT are identical and (2) the molecular structures of **1** and **2** maintain unchanged during the loading process.

Electrocatalytic ORR studies of **1**@CNT and **2**@CNT were conducted in 0.1 M KOH solutions. The CV of a GC electrode loaded with **1**@CNT displayed a pronounced catalytic current under O2 (Fig. 3a). This catalytic current is attributed to electrocatalytic ORR because the same measurement under argon showed no such currents. Note that the ORR wave with **1** peaked at 0.79 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). Similarly, **2**@ CNT also displayed a large catalytic ORR current with

the current wave peaked at 0.75 V versus RHE. Significantly, the catalytic peak current with **1**@CNT is about 2 times larger than that with **2**@CNT (Figs. 3 and S17). This improved ORR activity of **1**@CNT in terms of both the overpotentials and the catalytic currents was caused by its hanged imidazolium group. In addition, the CVs of **1**@CNT and **2**@CNT have also been measured in 0.5 M H2SO4 solutions. As shown in Fig. S18, the CVs of **1**@ CNT and **2**@CNT displayed catalytic ORR currents with the waves peaked at 0.69 V versus RHE and 0.51 V versus RHE, respectively. Notably, similar to the measurements in 0.1 M KOH solutions, the ORR current with **1**@CNT is twice as large as that of **2**@CNT in 0.5 M H2SO4 solutions (Fig. S18c). These results suggested that the cationic imidazolium group of **1** played crucial roles in promoting electrocatalytic ORR in both acidic and alkaline solutions. In addition to the through-space electrostatic interactions between the positively charged imidazolium group and the negatively charged O2-adduct, the imidazolium C2−H may also stabilize the O2-adduct through hydrogen-bonding interactions. Note that a similar hydrogen-bonding effect of the imidazolium C2−H was suggested in catalytic CO2 reduction reaction [67]. As a result, stabilizing O2-adducts through electrostatic and hydrogen-bonding interactions in **1** is considered a key for its improved 4e− ORR.

The number (*n*) of electrons transferred per O2 molecule during the ORR with **1**@CNT was examined by using rotating disk electrode (RDE) and rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) measurements. As shown in Fig. 4a, the linear sweep voltammogram (LSV) of **1**@ CNT displayed a pronounced ORR current with the halfwave potential *E*1/2 = 0.81 V versus RHE at 1600 rpm in an O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH solution, while **2**@CNT showed catalytic ORR current with the half-wave potential *E*1/2 = 0.78 V versus RHE. The ORR Tafel slope with **1**@CNT (67.3 mV per decade) is smaller than that of **2**@CNT (72.3 mV per decade), indicating good kinetics with **1** during the ORR (Fig. S19a). RRDE measurements gave *n* = 3.66 for **1**@CNT and *n* = 3.12 for **2**@ CNT (Fig. 4b). In RDE measurements (Figs. 4c and 4e), the *n* values were calculated from the Koutecky-Levich (K-L) analysis, giving *n* = 3.72 for **1**@CNT (Fig. 4d) and 3.15 for **2**@CNT (Fig. 4f). When taking these measurements in 0.5 M H2SO4 solutions, the ORR half-wave potentials were *E*1/2 = 0.65 V versus RHE for **1**@CNT and *E*1/2 = 0.54 V versus RHE for **2**@CNT (Fig. S20). The ORR Tafel slope of **1**@CNT (74.3 mV per decade) is also smaller than that of **2**@CNT (117.5 mV per decade) in 0.5 M H2SO4 solutions (Fig. S19b). The *n* values were also evaluated for electrocatalytic ORR in 0.5 M H2SO4 solutions by using RRDE measurements, giving *n* = 3.62 for **1**@CNT and 2.89 for **2**@CNT. Similar *n* values were also obtained from K-L analysis (Fig. S20). By comparing the ORR performance of **1** with that of previously reported molecular electrocatalysts, we can see that

**1** is a notable ORR electrocatalyst under both acidic and alkaline conditions (Tables S1 and S2).

The durability tests were then carried out to evaluate the stability of **1**@CNT and **2**@CNT by functioning as ORR electrocatalysts. After the 10-h electrolysis under controlled potentials, the electrocatalytic ORR currents with **1**@CNT and **2**@CNT dropped by 7.1% and 9.9% in 0.1 M KOH solutions (Fig. S21), respectively, while the currents with **1**@CNT and **2**@CNT dropped by 8.9% and 11.3% (Fig. S22) in 0.5 M H2SO4 solutions, respectively. In addition, the stability was also confirmed by analyzing the UV-vis (Figs. S23 and S24) and XPS (Figs. S25 and S26) spectra of the catalysts after electrolysis. These results thus showed that, in addition to activity and selectivity, the imidazolium group also played crucial roles in improving the stability of Co corroles for ORR.

## **CONCLUSIONS**

In conclusion, we reported on the design and synthesis of Co corrole **1** hanged with a biologically relevant imidazolium group and its electrocatalytic ORR features in aqueous solutions. Co corrole **1** displayed higher activity and selectivity than its imidazolium-free analogue for the electrocatalytic 4e− ORR in both acidic and alkaline solutions. This result suggested that the cationic imidazolium group plays a significant role in promoting ORR. Therefore, this work shows the effects of imidazolium groups on the reduction of O2 to water, which is valuable to understand the roles of the imidazole residues located at the C*c*O active sites and also for designing and developing active and selective ORR electrocatalysts.

### **Preparation of catalyst-loaded electrodes**

In a typical procedure, corrole **1** (0.62 mg, 0.5 μmol) or **2** (0.53 mg, 0.5 μmol) and 1.0 mg of CNTs were added to 0.5 mL acetonitrile containing 25 μL of nafion (5 wt%, DuPont). The mixture was ultra-sonicated for about 0.5 h to generate a homogeneous ink. Next, the homogeneous suspension was added to the surface of the GC electrode (5 μL), RDE disk electrode (10 μL), or RRDE disk electrode (10 μL) using a pipet. The electrodes were then dried slowly in dark at room temperature.

## **Electrochemical studies**

Electrochemical measurements were performed using CH Instruments (CHI 660D Electrochemical Analyzer) at room temperature. Cyclic voltammograms (CVs) were collected in dry acetonitrile (2 mL) containing 0.5 mM Co corrole and 0.1 M Bu4NPF6 using a three-compartment cell with a 0.07 cm2 glassy carbon (GC) working electrode, graphite rod counter electrode, and Ag/AgNO3

reference electrode (BASi, 10 mM AgNO<sub>3</sub>, 0.1 M Bu<sub>4</sub>NPF<sub>6</sub> in acetonitrile). The solution was bubbled with high-purity argon for at least 30 min before analysis. Ferrocene was added at the end of the measurement as an internal standard. Electrocatalytic ORR measurements were made in 0.1 M KOH and 0.5 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> solutions by using Biopotentiostat (model DY2300 Electrochemical Analyzer) in a conventional three-electrode system with rotating-ring disk electrode (RRDE) and rotating disk electrode (RDE) loaded with catalysts as the working electrode, carbon rod as the counter electrode, and Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl solution) as the reference electrode. The geometric dimensions of RRDE are: platinum ring electrode (0.188 cm<sup>2</sup>) and GC disk electrode (0.125 cm<sup>2</sup>). The collection efficiency of 0.42 was evaluated for this RRDE using the  $[Fe(CN)_6]^{3-/4}$  redox couple. Linear sweep voltammograms (LSVs) were measured in O<sub>2</sub>-saturated 0.1 M KOH and 0.5 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> solutions at 5 mV s<sup>-1</sup> scan rate. Tafel plots were calculated by measuring LSV data at 5 mV s<sup>-1</sup> scan rate and 1600 rpm rotating speed. The hydrogen peroxide percentage ( $\%H_2O_2$ ) yield can be calculated according to current densities at the disk  $(I_d)$  and the ring  $(I_r)$  electrodes using the following equation:

$$%H_2O_2 = 200 \times \frac{\frac{I_r}{N}}{I_d + \frac{I_r}{N}}.$$

In addition, the number (*n*) of electrons transferred during ORR could be calculated using RRDE analysis:

$$n = 4 \times \frac{I_d}{I_d + \frac{I_r}{N}}.$$

Koutecky-Levich (K-L) analysis:

$$\frac{1}{j} = \frac{1}{j_k} + \frac{1}{j_d} = -\frac{1}{nFkC_{O_2}} - \frac{1}{0.2nFD_{O_2}^{2/3} V^{-1/6}C_{O_2} \omega^{1/2}}.$$

in which  $I_{\rm d}$  is the disk current,  $I_{\rm r}$  is the ring current, and the current collection efficiency N=0.42;  $j_k$  and  $j_d$  are the kinetic and diffusion-limited current densities, respectively, n is the number of electrons transferred per molecule of  $O_2$ , F is the faraday constant (96485 C mol<sup>-1</sup>), k is the rate constant for ORR,  $C_{O_2}$  is the concentration of  $O_2$  dissolved in the bulk solution ( $1.26 \times 10^{-6}$  mol cm<sup>-3</sup> in 0.1 M KOH,  $1.13 \times 10^{-6}$  mol cm<sup>-3</sup> in 0.5 M  $H_2SO_4$ ),  $O_{O_2}$  is the diffusion coefficient of  $O_2$  ( $1.90 \times 10^{-5}$  cm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> in 0.1 M KOH,  $1.50 \times 10^{-5}$  cm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> in 0.5 M  $H_2SO_4$ ), V is the kinematic viscosity of the solution (0.01 cm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>), and  $O_2$  (rpm) is the rotation rate. The constant 0.2 is adopted when the rotation speed is expressed in rpm.

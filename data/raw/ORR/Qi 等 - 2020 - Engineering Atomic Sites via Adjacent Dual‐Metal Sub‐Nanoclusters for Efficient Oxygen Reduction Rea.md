**N-coordinated transition-metal materials are crucial alternatives to design cost-effective, efficient, and highly durable catalysts for electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction. Herein, the synthesis of uniformly distributed Cu−Zn clusters on porous N-doped carbon, which are accompanied by Cu/Zn-N***x* **single sites, is demonstrated. X-ray absorption fine structure tests reveal the co-existence of M−N (M = Cu or Zn) and M−M bonds in the catalyst. The catalyst shows excellent oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance in an alkaline medium with a positive half-wave potential of 0.884 V, a superior kinetic current density of 36.42 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> at 0.85 V, and a Tafel slope of 45 mV dec<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> , all of which are among the best-reported results. Furthermore, when employed as an air cathode in Zn-Air battery, it reveals a high open-cycle potential of 1.444 V and a peak power density of 164.3 mW cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> . Comprehensive experiments and theoretical calculations approved that the high activity of the catalyst can be attributed to the collaboration of the Cu/Zn-N4 sites with CuZn moieties on N-doped carbons.**

#### **1. Introduction**

Electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is considered one cornerstone of electrochemical energy storage and conversion technologies such as fuel cell and metal-air battery.[1–3] Platinumbased catalysts are generally known as the best catalysts for ORR, but their wide applicability is largely restricted by the high-cost and limited stability upon longterm working.[4–6] Therefore, designing cost-effective electrocatalysts with superior activity and sufficient stability is thereby increasingly attractive for ORR and advanced energy devices.[7–11]

As an important alternative to the expensive platinum-based catalysts, the earthabundant metals anchored on N-doped

carbon,[12,13] especially in the form of M−N−C (M = Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Mn, Zn, etc.),[14–18] are attracting great attention recently due to their low cost and unexpected ORR reactivity. The efficient performance of these M−N−C centers can be attributed to the atomic-level regulation of metal electronic structures by the N heteroatoms on carbon matrixes.[19] Following up these achievements, recent studies found that the N-coordinated bimetallic atomic pairs (such as CoNi,[20] FeCo,[21–23] ZnCo,[24] CoPt,[25] and FeMn[26] ) can further enhance the ORR catalytic activity through the "synergistic effect" between the atomically dispersed metal sites on carbon matrix, which comes to not only the asymmetry in the electron distribution around bimetal centers but also the coordination structures with N atoms in carbon nanostructures.[22] However, up to date, most of the work focused on the Fe, Co, Ni-based electrocatalysts,[21,22,27–30] and the active centers are always limited to the infrequent atomic pairs. Therefore, exploring more new metal components and ensuring higher concentrated multiatomic centers that anchored by heteroatoms on carbon supports would provide the possibility of more efficient ORR catalysts.

Recently, the nanomaterials containing Cu and Zn, such as single atoms,[31,32] atomic pairs,[24] and nanoparticles[33] were shown to have good ORR properties, while the Cu-Zn bimetal ones have never been scrutinized as ORR catalysts. Herein, we report a facile one-step pyrolysis method to prepare atomic CuZn sub-nanoclusters anchored by N atoms on carbons (denoted as CuZn/NC). Direct observation from high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) images clearly demonstrates the formation of homogenous Cu-Zn sub-nanoclusters as well as the single Cu/ Zn sites all-over carbon support. X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) analysis confirms the M−M (M = Cu or Zn) and M−N coordination structures of CuZn/NC. These N coordinated Cu-Zn bimetal structure endows CuZn/NC very high activity and robust stability for ORR in alkaline solution, with a high half-wave potential (*E*1/2) of 0.884 V and an open-circuit voltage of 1.444 V as well as a large power density of 164.3 mW cm−<sup>2</sup> for Zn-Air batteries. The ORR activity of CuZn/NC even outperforms the commercial Pt/C catalyst. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that ORR performance of M−N (M = Cu or Zn) sites on N-doped carbons can be enhanced by the integration with CuZn moieties through dropping their free energies of key intermediates, such as • OOH and • O. Cooperation of atomic Cu/Zn sites with CuZn nanoclusters contributed to the efficient oxygen reduction reaction of the catalyst.

#### **2. Results and Discussion**

CuZn cluster on N-doped carbon (CuZn/NC) was synthesized by a simple one-step carbonization method similar to our previous reports,[34–36] and it was schematically illustrated in **Figure 1**a. The liquid precursors were first prepared by mixing a certain amount of C6H12O6 (C sources), NH3OHCl (N sources), CuCl2, and ZnCl2 aqueous solutions, which was thereafter carbonated at 850 °C under Ar atmosphere to get CuZn/NC (see more details in the Experimental Section). The weight percentage of Cu, Zn in CuZn/NC was determined to be 0.24 and 0.15 wt%, respectively, by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS) technology. The lower amount of Zn compared with Cu can be attributed to the partial evaporation of Zn atoms (boil point: 907 °C) under the high-temperature annealing process.[37] Of note that the evaporation of Zn atoms, as well as volatilization of the gas generated, induced abundant defects on the carbon support and endowed a porous structure of CuZn/NC.[38] It is confirmed by a high specific surface area of 776.04 m2 g<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> and the existence of micro- and mesoporous features (Figure S1, Supporting Information). X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns (Figure 1b) show two broad humps at around 26° and 44°, assigning to the (002) and (101) planes of graphitic carbon.[39–41]

To check the morphology of the as-prepared CuZn/NC, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were performed as depicted in Figure 1c and Figure S2 (Supporting Information). As shown in Figure 1c, the high-angle annular dark-field transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) image of CuZn/NC shows a homogeneous dispersion of CuZn sub-nanoclusters. The crystalline Cu or Zn is absent in CuZn/NC as indicated by the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) in Figure S2b (Supporting Information), being consistent with previous reports.[42,43] Electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) mappings reveal that the Cu and Zn are distributed homogeneously over CuZn clusters (Figure 1d). The co-existence of the Cu and Zn elements in CuZn/NC can also be indicated by the energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mappings and spectrum in Figure S3 (Supporting Information). By further enhancing the magnification, the aberration-corrected HAADF-STEM image clearly illustrates the amorphous structure of CuZn sub-nanoclusters on the N-doped carbons, with some individual metal atom sites occasionally distributed (Figure 1e,f and Figure S4, Supporting Information). The statistical analysis indicates an average particle size of ≈1 nm for these nanoclusters (Figure 1g).

For comparison, monometallic Cu/NC and Zn/NC, as well as the NC counterpart were also prepared according to a similar procedure as CuZn/NC. The Cu and Zn amounts in CuZn/NC were determined to be 0.51 and 0.26 wt%, respectively (Table S1, Supporting Information). The XRD patterns (Figure S5, Supporting Information), TEM, SAED, and EDS mapping images (Figures S6 and S7, Supporting Information) indicate that homogeneous distributed Cu or Zn sub-nanoclusters are formed on Cu/NC and Zn/NC, but without obvious crystallinity. The obtained four specimens (CuZn/NC, Cu/NC, Zn/ NC, and NC) were further analyzed by Raman spectroscopy (Figure S8, Supporting Information). The intensity ratio of the *D* peak to *G* peak (*I*D/*I*G) decreases as the order of Zn/NC (1.05) > CuZn/NC (1.01) > Cu/NC (0.98) > NC (0.94), suggesting that the doping of Cu and Zn in NC induced additional defects into the NC support.[31,44]

X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) and X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were used to characterize the coordination environments and chemical state of Cu and Zn species in CuZn/NC. The normalized X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) present in **Figure 2**a reveals the absorption edge of CuZn/NC locates between Zn foil and ZnCl2, suggesting the average valence state of Zn in CuZn/NC is between Zn(0) and ZnCl2(II).[24,30,45] The Zn K-edge extended X-ray absorption fine

structure (EXAFS) spectrum of CuZn/NC (Figure 2b) exhibits two obvious peaks located at 1.4 and 2.3 Å, corresponding to the nearest Zn-N and Zn-M (M = Cu or Zn) coordination, respectively. [24,31,45] The valence state of Zn was also confirmed by XPS analysis. As indicated in Figure 2c, Zn 2p peaks are observed at binding energies of 1045.0 eV (2p<sub>1/2</sub>) and 1022.3 eV (2p<sub>3/2</sub>), suggesting the co-existence of Zn(0) and Zn(II).[45] Furthermore, it shows that the binding energy of Zn 2p for CuZn/NC is almost the same as the of Zn/NC. This suggests that the chemical states of Zn in CuZn/NC are similar to those of Zn/NC, and the charge transfer between Cu and Zn atoms is relatively weak, which is probably due to the similar electronegativity of Cu and Zn atoms. Similarly, Figure 2d shows that the edge position of Cu K-edge XANES spectra of CuZn/NC locates between Cu foil and CuO, suggesting the average electronic state of the Cu species is between Cu(0) and Cu(II). [46,47] Cu K-edge EXAFS of CuZn/NC (Figure 2e) clearly indicates two main peaks at 1.5 and 2.2 Å, which could be attributed to Cu-N scattering paths and Cu-M (M = Cu or Zn) coordinations, respectively. [31,45] The XPS spectrum of the Cu 2p was illustrated in Figure 2f. Sharp Cu  $2p_{3/2}$  and Cu  $2p_{1/2}$  peaks are observed at 932.7 and 952.4 eV, respectively, which can be divided into Cu(I)/Cu(0) and Cu(II) species.<sup>[48]</sup> High-resolution Cu 2p XPS spectrum of CuZn/NC shows no obvious change compared with that of the Cu/NC counterpart, in line with the Zn 2p XPS results.

The overall chemical composition of these CuZn samples and the bonding of N heteroatoms were also investigated by XPS technology. As expected, the overall survey scans confirmed the existence of Cu, Zn, N, and C elements as indicated in Figure S9 (Supporting Information), demonstrating successful doping of Cu/Zn atoms and N heteroatoms in the carbon matrixes of NC, Cu/NC, Zn/NC, and CuZn/NC catalysts. The N 1s spectrum for CuZn/NC can be deconvoluted

into pyridinic N (398.8 eV), pyrrolic N (400.6 eV), graphitic N (401.4 eV), and oxidized N (403.6 eV), respectively (Figure S10, Supporting Information). In addition, the abundant N doping and defective sites provided many anchor sites for Cu and Zn metal centers, and resulted in the formation of Cu–N (397.9 eV) and Zn–N (399.7 eV) bonds in Figure S10 (Supporting Information).

The ORR catalytic activity of CuZn/NC was measured in O<sub>2</sub>-saturated 0.1 м KOH with a rotating disk electrode (RDE). All the potential values given for the ORR test were referenced to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). As observed in Figure S11 (Supporting Information), in comparing with the N<sub>2</sub>-saturated case, a well-defined cathodic reduction peak is observed for CuZn/NC in the O2-saturated solution, indicating its catalytic activity toward ORR. The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves in Figure 3a reveal a much higher ORR activity for CuZn/NC than that of Cu/NC, Zn/NC, and NC: the onset potential ( $E_{onset}$ ) and  $E_{1/2}$  of CuZn/NC are 0.982 and 0.884 V, respectively, both of which surpass those of Cu/NC ( $E_{\text{onset}}$ : 0.901 V;  $E_{1/2}$ : 0.793 V), Zn/NC ( $E_{\text{onset}}$ : 0.868 V;  $E_{1/2}$ : 0.781 V), and NC ( $E_{onset}$ : 0.801 V;  $E_{1/2}$ : 0.735 V). Moreover, the  $E_{1/2}$  value of CuZn/NC is even 28 mV more positive than Pt/C. The kinetic current density ( $I_k$ ) of CuZn/NC is 36.42 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> at 0.85 V, which is the highest among all tested catalysts (Figure S12, Supporting Information). The better ORR activity could also be confirmed by the favorable kinetics of CuZn/NC. As shown in Figure 3b, the Tafel CuZn/NC is 45.0 mV  $dec^{-1}$ , much lower than that of Pt/C (70.6 mV  $dec^{-1}$ ). In addition, CuZn/NC exhibited a more active limiting current density  $(I_1)$  of 5.11 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, better than those of Cu/ NC (4.46 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>) and Zn/NC (4.91 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>) and comparable to Pt/C (5.26 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>). The ORR activities of CuZn/ NC also surpass most of those non-precious metal based

electrocatalysts (Table S2, Supporting Information). The  $J_{\rm L}$  in the LSV curves of CuZn/NC increases with the rotation speed from 400 to 2500 rpm (Figure S13a, Supporting Information). The electron transfer number of CuZn/NC was evaluated to be  $\approx$ 4.02 according to K–L plots (Figure S13b, Supporting Information), suggesting a four-electron reaction pathway for ORR. [24,49]

Rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE) tests were conducted to clarify the reaction kinetics, as shown in Figure 3c. The calculated transferred electron number *n* is 3.9–4.0 from 0.1 to 0.8 V, corresponding with a low peroxide yield below 5% (Figure 3d). Furthermore, a better methanol tolerance was also demonstrated for CuZn/NC compared with Pt/C (Figure 3e). The durability of CuZn/NC was evaluated by a 30 000 s continuous electrolysis (Figure 3f). After the test, CuZn/NC showed a smaller current drop of 12.3% than that of Pt/C (49.4%). Moreover, after 2000 continuous CV cycles, CuZn/NC exhibited an only 8 mV change in  $E_{1/2}$ , as illustrated in Figure S14 (Supporting Information). In addition, the TEM images (Figure S15, Supporting Information) and the XRD measurements (Figure S16, Supporting Information) indicate no aggregation and crystalline-phase formation for CuZn/NC. Meantime, the valence state remains unchanged after ORR tests as observed by XPS results (Figure S17, Supporting Information). All these durability tests and characterizations demonstrated the superb stability of CuZn/NC.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) curves were measured to further understand the ORR reaction kinetics and intrinsic activity of the active sites. As shown in Figure S18 (Supporting Information), the four curves of NC, Cu/NC, Zn/NC, and CuZn/ NC show little difference in the semicircle areas in the highfrequency region, indicating similar charge-transfer resistances of the samples. Therefore, the low amount of Cu-Zn codecoration in N-doped graphene nanosheets induced little improvement in electrical transport. ECSA was measured to evaluate the intrinsic activity of CuZn/NC according to double layer capacitance ( $C_{\rm dl}$ ) method. As shown in Figure S19 (Supporting Information), the  $C_{\rm dl}$  values of CuZn/NC is 27.6 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>, larger than that of NC (15.1 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>), while similar with those of Cu/ NC (22.5 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>) and Zn/NC (25.9 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>). After normalizing the polarization curves by ECSA, CuZn/NC still exhibited higher ORR activity than Cu/NC and Zn/NC (Figure S19f, Supporting Information), indicating that the existence of CuZn nanoclusters brought a higher intrinsic activity of the active sites compared with that of Cu/NC and Zn/NC.

To further understand the role of the atomic CuZn nanoclusters plays in the superior ORR activity of the CuZn/NC. Acid treatment by HNO $_3$  was employed to etch unstable bimetallic CuZn clusters on CuZn/NC (denoted as CuZn-SA/NC). The aberration-corrected atomic-resolution HAADF-STEM images of CuZn-SA/NC were illustrated in Figure S20 (Supporting Information), in which no obvious nanoclusters can be observed. On the contrary, small bright spots are evenly distributed, corresponding to the individual Cu or Zn atoms. The amount of Cu and Zn decreased to 0.05 and 0.03 wt%, respectively. It indicated that the metal clusters were removed during acid treatment. Electrochemical tests in Figure S21a (Supporting Information) demonstrated an  $E_{\rm onset}$  of 0.902 V

and  $E_{1/2}$  of 0.803 V, much smaller than that of CuZn/NC. Furthermore, a loss of  $I_{\rm I}$  of  $\approx 16\%$  (4.52 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>) was observed on CuZn-SA/NC when compared with CuZn/NC. Therefore, the presence of bimetal CuZn clusters is indispensable for the high ORR performance of CuZn-SA/NC. We further investigated the influence of Cu and Zn doping level on the electrocatalytic activity of as-prepared CuZn-based catalysts. As shown in Figure S22 (Supporting Information), further increasing of Cu or Zn amount both lead to a negative shift of LSV curves. As a result, the  $E_{1/2}$  of CuZn (2:4) /NC and CuZn (4:2) /NC is 0.800 eV and 0.738 eV, respectively, much lower than that of CuZn (2:2) /NC (i.e., CuZn/NC). Similarly, decreasing the amount of Cu or Zn amount also leads to a poor ORR performance. CuZn (1:2) /NC and CuZn (2:1) /NC exhibited  $E_{1/2}$  values of 0.789 and 0.796 eV, respectively. The optimized Cu/Zn ratio and loading amount highlighted the role of sub-nano CuZn clusters for ORR performance. The higher aggregation and lower loading both resulted in an inferior electrocatalytic activity.

To further understand the origins of the high ORR performance of CuZn/NC, DFT calculations were performed. Considering that the actual Cu/Zn mole ratio is ≈1.6, Cu<sub>8</sub>Zn<sub>5</sub> clusters were built as the model of CuZn clusters (CuZn<sub>NC</sub>), and ZnN<sub>4</sub> or CuN<sub>4</sub> sites integrated with CuZn<sub>NC</sub> models on graphene were used to mimic CuZn/NC<sup>[43]</sup> (Figure 4a). In addition, single CuN<sub>4</sub> and ZnN<sub>4</sub> sites were also constructed for comparison. The ORR activity of these N-coordinated Cu and Zn sites on graphene was compared. Figure 4b,c shows Gibbs free energies (eV) of the reaction intermediates of 'OOH, 'O, and 'OH. The diagrams of adsorption configurations were listed in Tables S3-S6 (Supporting Information). The ORR free energy diagrams on ZnN<sub>4</sub> and ZnN<sub>4</sub>-CuZn<sub>NC</sub> sites showed consistent downhill energy profiles, with 'OOH  $\rightarrow$  'O as the rate-determining step. However, for CuN<sub>4</sub> and CuN<sub>4</sub>-CuZn<sub>NC</sub> sites, an uphill step was observed for  $O_2 \rightarrow {}^{\bullet}OOH$  at U = 0 V, suggesting the inferior ORR activity of Cu sites. Moreover, when U = 1.23 V, the ORR overpotentials of CuN<sub>4</sub> and CuN<sub>4</sub>-CuZn<sub>NC</sub> are as high as 1.62 and 1.30 eV, respectively. Therefore, compared with Cu sites, the ORR is more favorable to proceed on Zn sites in CuZn/NC.

The influence of CuZn<sub>NC</sub> on CuN<sub>4</sub> and ZnN<sub>4</sub> sites can be investigated by comparing the free energy profiles of ZnN<sub>4</sub> and CuN<sub>4</sub> with those of ZnN<sub>4</sub>-CuZn<sub>NC</sub> and CuN<sub>4</sub>-CuZn<sub>NC</sub> models. As shown in Figure 4b,c, obvious drops of the free energy of 'OOH and 'O adsorbates (G-OOH and G-O) were noticed after the introduction of  $CuZn_{NC}$ , and consequently, the  $ZnN_4$ -CuZn<sub>NC</sub> and CuN<sub>4</sub>-CuZn<sub>NC</sub> exhibited lower overpotentials for ORR compared with the ZnN<sub>4</sub> and CuN<sub>4</sub> sites. Furthermore, the adsorption energies of oxygen ( $\Delta E_{O2}$ ) dropped obviously after the introduction of the CuZn<sub>NC</sub>, and the ZnN<sub>4</sub>-CuZn<sub>NC</sub> exhibited the lowest adsorption energy of 3.4 eV (Figure 4d). Meantime, the  $G_{OOH}$  implied a linearity drop as the order of  $CuN_4 > CuN_4$ - $CuZn_{NC} > ZnN_4 > ZnN_4$ - $CuZn_{NC}$  versus the calculated overpotentials (Figure 4e). Especially, the ORR overpotential of ZnN<sub>4</sub>-CuZn<sub>NC</sub> exhibited the lowest value of 0.81 eV among these four models because of the moderate adsorption energy of ORR intermediates.<sup>[50]</sup>

In addition, the activity of other possible CuZn active sites (without N- coordinations) in  $\text{CuN}_4\text{-CuZn}_{NC}$  and  $\text{ZnN}_4\text{-CuZn}_{NC}$  was also evaluated as shown in Figure S23 and Table S7

(Supporting Information). The ZnN4-ZnNC model was also used to exam the ORR activity of pure Zn clusters. The free energies of key intermediates (*G*•O and *G*•OH) on these active sites were calculated.[51] As shown in Table S7 (Supporting Information), the *G*•O and *G*•OH of these metal sites on CuZnNC and ZnNC clusters are much smaller than the M−N4 (M = Zn or Cu) sites in CuN4-CuZnNC and ZnN4-CuZnNC. The values of *G*•OH on these sites are even below 0.35 eV, so the corresponding free energy barriers for • OH → H2O step increase sharply, leading to the overpotentials more than 0.98 eV. Therefore, all of these active sites exhibited higher overpotential than the ZnN4-CuZnNC site due to the excessively strong adsorption of • OH, confirming the low ORR activity of CuZnNC and ZnNC.

Meantime, the ZnN4 site in ZnN4-ZnNC also displayed a higher overpotential of 0.98 eV. This agrees with the experimental results that Zn/NC showed moderate ORR activity as discussed above. Therefore, these comparative studies highlighted the important role of N-coordinated CuZn clusters in promoting ORR, and confirmed the metal-nitrogen sites that modulated by alloy clusters are efficient active sites for ORR.

Using CuZn/NC as an air cathode, a homemade primary Zn-air battery was assembled to evaluate the application of CuZn/NC as an energy-related device. CuZn/NC-loaded nickel foam on a gas diffusion layer was served as an air cathode, together with a Zn plate as anode and 6 m KOH as electrolyte, respectively. For comparison, the Pt/C electrode

was tested under the same conditions. When galvanostatically discharged at 10 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> , CuZn/NC-based Zn-air battery delivered a stable discharge voltage around 1.2 V (**Figure 5**a), and the specific capacity was 737.3 mAh g<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> normalized to the mass of consumed Zn, slightly lower than the Pt/C-based one (782.2 mAh g<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> ). The polarization and power density plots were depicted in Figure 5b. CuZn/NC showed a current density of 120.8 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2 at 1.0 V, which is ≈78% of Pt/C (155.6 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> ). The maximum power density of CuZn/NC-based Zn-air battery reached 164.3 mW cm<sup>−</sup>2, comparable with the Pt/C-based one (167.1 mW cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> ), indicating the excellent performance of the CuZn/NC as the air cathode. The open-circuit voltage of the assembled Zn-air battery is ≈1.444 V (Figure 5c). The performance of CuZn/NC-based Zn-air battery also outperformed most of the previous works (Table S8, Supporting Information). As a comparison, CuZn-SA/NC-based Zn-air battery was also assembled and it showed a specific capacity and maximum power density of 612.8 mAh g−<sup>1</sup> and 127.4 mW cm<sup>−</sup>2, respectively, both of which are much lower than those of CuZn/NC-based one (Figure S20b, Supporting Information). This is consistent with the poor ORR performance of CuZn-SA/NC.

To evaluate the stability of CuZn/NC, a rechargeable Zn-air battery was assembled by using a mixture of CuZn/NC and IrO2 (84.5 wt %) as the air cathode, and 6 m KOH containing 0.2 m zinc acetate as electrolyte (Figure 5d). The Pt/C + IrO2 electrode (mass ratio of 1: 1) was also tested under the same conditions for comparison. CuZn/NC/IrO2-based battery indicated no visible increase of overpotentials during the longterm charging and discharging cycling tests (20 min cycle−<sup>1</sup> ) (Figure 5e). By contrast, an obvious increase in overpotential of the Pt/C/IrO2-based one can be observed, which probably due to the oxidation and loss of Pt metals during the charging process.[52] The above results indicated the excellent stability of CuZn/NC catalyst in a Zn-air battery.

### **3. Conclusions**

In conclusion, a novel CuZn/NC ORR electrocatalyst composed of CuZn alloy sub-nanoclusters and Cu/Zn single sites on the carbon matrix has been successfully developed in this study. The resulting catalyst displayed an excellent ORR electrocatalytic activity in terms of a high *E*onset (0.982 V) and *E*1/2 (0.884 V). Furthermore, the assembled Zn-air batteries showed an excellent power density of 164.3 mW cm−<sup>2</sup> , as well as excellent stability. Comprehensive DFT calculations showed that the ORR activity of the N-coordinated single metal sites can be enhanced by the Cu-Zn clusters. The cooperative interplay derived from Cu/Zn-N4 sites and CuZn clusters is the driving force to the excellent electrocatalytic performance of CuZn/NC. Especially, CuZn moiety bonded single Zn−N4 sites are the most efficient sites in catalyzing ORR. This finding illustrated a new way of incorporating N-coordinated single sites with bimetal nanoclusters toward enhancing the ORR activity.

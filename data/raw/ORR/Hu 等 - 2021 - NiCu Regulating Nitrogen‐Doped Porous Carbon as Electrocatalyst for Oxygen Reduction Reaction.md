Transition metal and nitrogen co-doped carbon materials have been widely investigated as promising electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Incorporating two different metals in N-doped carbon may synergistically improve the catalytic activity. Herein, Ni/Cu incorporated N-doped porous carbon materials (Ni1-xCux-N C) with different Ni/Cu ratios were prepared by a direct carbonization of the metal-organic complexes which were obtained via a NaOH-mediated organometallic reaction of metal ions and benzimidazole. It is found that the Ni/Cu ratio significantly alters the Ni1-xCux particle sizes, the surface morphology, the specific surface area, and the pore structure of the catalysts, eventually affecting the ORR activities. Ni0.7Cu0.3-N C exhibits the best ORR activity among the studied Ni1-xCux-N C catalysts with a half-wave potential of 0.783 V and a limiting current density of 4.85 mAcm <sup>2</sup> in alkaline medium. Density functional theory calculations confirm that the synergistic effect of bimetallic Ni/Cu can optimize the adsorption/desorption features and promote the ORR catalytic activities.

### **1. Introduction**

The consumption of nonrenewable fossil fuels in the industry and daily life has caused serious problems of resource shortage and environmental degradation. Much attention has been paid to the development of renewable energy resources. Fuel cell is considered as one of the most promising energy devices due to its high reliability and environmental friendliness. However, the sluggish oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on the cathode impedes the efficiency of the fuel cells.[1–3] To date, high loading of Pt catalysts is required to accelerate ORR, which increases the cost and hinder the commercial application of fuel cells. Therefore, numerous efforts have been devoted to developing efficient and low-cost catalysts as alternatives to Pt-based catalysts.[4] Transition metal-nitrogen-carbon (M N C) electrocatalysts are among the most promising candidates for ORR due to their high activity and low cost.[5–7] It is widely accepted that M-Nx species and N-doped carbon encapsulated metal nanoparticles are the primary efficient active sites for ORR.[8,9]

Incorporating two different metals in N-doped carbon to form bimetallic M1M2 N C catalysts may further improve the catalytic activity. It was reported that bimetal CuFe regulating N-doped carbon displayed much better catalytic activity than the pristine Fe N C ascribed the synergistic effects of the bimetallic doping.[10] The synergistic effect of Fe and Mn was reported to improve the ORR activity where the interaction between the dual metal sites reduced the \*OH reduction energy barrier during ORR pathway.[11] Both N-doped carbon encapsulated CoNi alloy nanoparticle composite[12] and atomically dispersed binary Co Ni sites embedded in N-doped carbon[13] were reported to have superior ORR activities. FeCo N C with Fe Co dual sites embedded on N-doped porous carbon could be favored for the four-electron oxygen reduction and displayed superior ORR performance.[14] The synergistic effect in FeCo N C was evidenced with the construction of Fe Co dual-atom centered site FeCoN5 OH with a spontaneously absorbed electron-withdrawing OH ligand owing to a tailored electronic structure and optimized geometry configuration.[15]

Metal-organic hybrid materials are commonly used as precursors for the synthesis of M N C catalysts.[16–18] Metalorganic frameworks (MOFs) with high specific surface area, porous structure and adjustable frames have emerged as attractive precursors for synthesizing hierarchical porous structured M N-C catalysts.[19–22] For example, Zhang and co-workers prepared Co Fe alloy/N-doped carbon hollow spheres using a dual-MOF-assisted pyrolysis approach, demonstrating that a rational configuration of dual-MOF structures as precursors may effectively enhance catalytic activity toward ORR.[23] In our previous study, we have prepared hierarchical micro-/mesoporous FeCo N C catalysts with controlled morphologies using bimetallic MOF structures as precursors.[24] Nevertheless, devel-

oping a simple and efficient fabrication strategy to achieve M N C catalysts with desired properties remains a challenge.

Theoretical calculation has predicted that Cu has higher ORR activities than other transition metals such as Fe, Co, and Ni from the viewpoint of the metals themselves.[25] Cu N C catalysts were reported to be excellent electrocatalysts for ORR attributed to the synergism of Cu and N dopants.[26,27] Our previous studies reported that both Cu N C and Cu C catalysts exhibited good catalytic activities toward ORR.[28,29] Herein, Ni/Cu incorporated N-doped porous carbon materials (Ni1-xCux-N C, x=0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, and 1) were fabricated by a direct carbonization of the metal-organic complexes. The structure-related ORR properties were thoroughly presented and discussed. In addition, theoretical computations were performed to further investigate the ORR mechanism and ORR selectivity of Ni1-xCux-N C catalysts.

#### **2. Results and discussion**

The metal-organic hybrid precursors Ni1-xCux-BIM (x=0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, and 1) were prepared by the organometallic reaction of Ni<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup>/Cu2<sup>+</sup> ions and benzimidazole using a NaOH assisted method (see details in the supporting information). The use of NaOH is crucial for the high-yield synthesis of Ni1-xCux-BIM complexes. NaOH may deprotonate the ligand and improve the coordination interaction between the metal ions and ligand.[24] Amorphous hydroxides may also be formed by the side reactions between the metal ions and OH . X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns (Figure S1a) show that all the Ni1-xCux-BIM metal-organic complexes have the same crystal structure. The evident peak at low angle around 2*θ*=9° indicating the structure could be a metal-organic framework. No crystalline phase of hydroxides was observed from the XRD. The diffraction peaks of Ni1-xCux-BIM become sharper at higher Cu content, indicating an increase of crystallinity and crystallite size. The crystallite sizes of metal-organic hybrid precursors Ni1 xCux-BIM were calculated by the Scherrer equation (Figure S1b). It can be seen that the crystallite size increases with the Cu content in Ni1-xCux-BIM. The crystallite sizes of Ni1-xCux-BIM precursors significantly affect the morphology of Ni1-xCux-N C catalysts, which were fabricated by a direct carbonization of Ni1-xCux-BIM at 900°C.

The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of Ni1-xCux-N C catalysts are shown in Figure 1 and Figure S2, respectively. It can be seen that the carbon substrates of Ni-N C and Ni0.9Cu0.1-N C consist of small aggregated granule-like carbon particles. Irregular fragmental carbon substrates are found for the catalysts of x� 3, and the size of the carbon fragment increases with the Cu content in Ni1-xCux-N C, confirming that the crystallite sizes of the precursors significantly affect the morphologies of Ni1-xCux-N C. Metallic particles with a darker contrast compared to the carbon are decorated on the carbon substrates for each Ni1 xCux-N C catalyst. The Ni1-xCux particle sizes of Ni1-xCux-N C obtained from the TEM images are listed in Table 1. It shows that the Ni1-xCux particle size increases largely with the increase of Cu content in Ni1-xCux-N C from 17.4 nm for x=0 to∼ 600 nm for x=1.

Figure 2a shows the XRD patterns of Ni1-xCux-N C (x=0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, and 1). Single Ni1-xCux crystalline phase with face-centered cubic structure is observed for all Ni1-xCux-N C catalysts, indicating that Cu and Ni form solid solutions. The diffraction peaks of Ni1-xCux shift toward lower angles with the increase of Cu content due to the increase of the unit cell parameters. Rietveld refinements were performed on the XRD patterns to calculate the unit cell parameters of Ni1-xCux phase (Figure S3). It shows that the composition-dependent unit cell parameter of Ni1-xCux increases linearly with x in the Ni Cu system (Figure 2b), confirming the formation of Ni1-xCux alloy nanoparticles in Ni1-xCux-N/C catalysts.

(c) N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms of Ni N C, Ni0.7Cu0.3-N C, and Cu N C. (d) Pore diameter distributions calculated from the adsorption branches of the N2 isotherms.

The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) specific surface areas of Ni N C, Ni0.7Cu0.3-N C, and Cu N C were measured through the N2 adsorption-desorption method. The specific surface areas are 201.8, 401.3, and 91.7 m2g <sup>1</sup> for Ni N C, Ni0.7Cu0.3- N C, and Cu N C. Despite of the larger carbon particle sizes in Ni0.7Cu0.3-N C than in Ni N C, Ni0.7Cu0.3-N C has much larger specific surface area, which could be ascribed to the severe aggregation of carbon particles in Ni N C. Due to the large carbon particle size and Cu particle size, Cu N C has relatively low specific surface area. As shown in Figure 2c, Ni N C and Ni0.7Cu0.3-N C behave typical IV-type isotherms whereas Cu N C displays a typical I-type isotherm. The Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) pore size distribution curves (Figure 2d) show the distribution peaks of 2.7 nm and 2.6 nm for Ni N C and Ni0.7Cu0.3-N C, respectively, indicating the coexistence of microporous and mesoporous structures. The peak of BJH pore size distribution of Cu N C is below 1.7 nm, indicating a microporous-dominated structure. The Raman spectra (Figure S4) of Ni N C, Ni0.7Cu0.3-N C, and Cu N C show typical D and G bands of carbon materials. The intensity ratios of the D peak to G peak (*I*D/*I*G) are about 0.73, 0.89, and 1.04 for Ni N C, Ni0.7Cu0.3-N C, and Cu N C, respectively, indicating the degree of defects of the carbon structure increases with Cu content in Ni1-xCux-N C.

Figure 3a shows the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) survey spectra of Ni N C, Ni0.7Cu0.3-N C, and Cu N C, confirming the presence of C, N, O, and respective metallic elements in the catalysts. The N contents are 4.86 at%, 5.70 at

%, and 8.28 at%, for Ni N C, Ni0.7Cu0.3-N C, and Cu N C, respectively, suggesting that the addition of Cu is beneficial to the enhancement of N content in the catalysts. The highresolution C 1s spectra (Figure 3b) are deconvoluted into three peaks, corresponding to three different types of C species: C C, C N and C O, indicating that N and O heteroatoms are efficiently doped in the carbon matrix for all the three catalysts. The N 1s spectra (Figure 3c) are deconvoluted into three peaks assigning to pyridinic N, graphitic N, and oxidized N, which are believed to be important for the ORR activity. The O 1s spectra (Figure 3d) show single characteristic peak assigning to C O species for both Ni0.7Cu0.3-N C, and Cu N C, in which C O is from the doped carbon substrate, indicating that the metal oxides can be neglected in the catalysts. Both zero-valent state

(Ni<sup>0</sup> ) and high-valent state (Ni*<sup>n</sup>*<sup>+</sup>) are detected in Ni 2p spectra of Ni N C and Ni0.7Cu0.3-N C (Figure 3e). Ni<sup>0</sup> is from the Ni or NixCu1-x metallic particles, and Ni*<sup>n</sup>*<sup>+</sup> is mainly from the Ni-Nx species that embedded in the carbon substrates. The ratio of Ni*<sup>n</sup>*<sup>+</sup>/Ni<sup>0</sup> is higher in Ni0.7Cu0.3-N C than Ni N C, suggesting that the content of Ni-Nx species could be higher in Ni0.7Cu0.3- N C. Zero-valent state (Cu0 ) and high-valent state (Cu*<sup>n</sup>*<sup>+</sup>) are detected in Cu 2p spectra of Cu N C, whereas Cu*<sup>n</sup>*<sup>+</sup> is the primary state in Ni0.7Cu0.3-N C (Figure 3f). Since the metal oxides can be neglected in the catalysts according to O1s spectra, Ni*<sup>n</sup>*<sup>+</sup> and Cu*<sup>n</sup>*<sup>+</sup> should be mainly from the Ni-Nx and Cu-Nx species that embedded in the carbon substrates, suggesting that M-Nx (M=Ni and/or Cu) species are presented in the Ni1-xCux-N C catalysts. In addition, the content of M-Nx species is higher in Ni0.7Cu0.3-N C compared to Ni N C and Cu N C, indicating that the bimetal effect impels Ni/Cu atoms to form more M-Nx species. It is noted that binary M1M2 dualatom species embedded in N-doped carbon are commonly presented in bimetallic M1M2-N C catalysts.[14,15] Therefore, Ni*<sup>n</sup>*<sup>+</sup> and Cu*<sup>n</sup>*<sup>+</sup> in Ni0.7Cu0.3-N C may also form Ni Cu dual-atom species (Ni Cu-Nx) embedded in carbon substrate, which synergistically improve the ORR activities of the catalysts.

Evaluation of the ORR activity was performed by rotating disk electrode (RDE) measurements in 0.1 M KOH solution. Figure 4a shows the cyclic voltammetric (CV) curves of Ni1-xCux-N C (x=0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, and 1). All the catalysts exhibit welldefined reduction peaks in O2-saturated electrolyte, while featureless voltammetric currents in N2-saturated electrolyte, indicating the electrocatalytic activity toward oxygen reduction. Figure 4b shows the Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves of Ni1-xCux-N C and Pt/C (20 wt%) recorded in O2-saturated electrolyte at 1600 rpm. The onset potentials (*E*0, the potential at 0.1 mAcm <sup>2</sup> ) and half-wave potentials (*E*1/2) are summarized in Figure 4c and Table 1. It can be seen that Ni0.7Cu0.3-N C shows the best ORR activity (*E*0=0.872 V, *E*1/2=0.783 V, and *j*L= 4.85 mAcm <sup>2</sup> ) among the Ni1-xCux-N C catalysts. To clarify the ORR electron-transfer pathway, LSV curves of different catalysts were recorded at various rotating speeds (400–2025 rpm) as shown in Figure 4d and S5–S9. The apparent numbers of electrons transferred (*n*) are calculated by the Koutecky-Levich (K L) equation.[30] The K L plots (Figure 4e and S5–S9) exhibit excellent linearity with the first order reaction kinetics. Figure 4f compares the *n* values of different Ni1-xCux-N C catalysts. Ni0.7Cu0.3-N C has the highest apparent number of electrons transfferred with an *n* value of 3.84, indicating a predominantly four-electron transfer ORR pathway. It is suggested that the improved ORR activity of Ni0.7Cu0.3-N C is attributing to the high specific surface area, the relative high N content, and the synergistic effect of bimetallic Ni Cu dual-atom species embedded in N-doped carbon.

The stability of Ni0.7Cu0.3-N C was evaluated in O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH solution by the chronoamperometric measurement at 0.61 V at 1600 rpm (Figure S10a). It is found that Ni0.7Cu0.3- N C retains a relative current of ∼76% of the initial current after the test of 20000 s. In addition, the methanol tolerance measurement shows no obvious change of the current density of Ni0.7Cu0.3-N C upon the addition of methanol (Figure S10b), suggesting a high selectivity toward ORR and a good tolerance to methanol crossover.

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations have been used to further investigate the ORR mechanism and synergistic effect of bimetallic Ni/Cu of Ni1-xCux-N C. Despite that encapsulated metal or alloy nanoparticles have been suggested to active the surrounding N doped carbon layers, making them active toward ORR, M-Nx species are generally believed as the primary ORR active sites.[10,31] For simplicity, Ni N4, Cu N4 and Ni Cu N6 are adopted as active site models for theoretical simulations for Ni N C, Cu N C, and bimetallic Ni Cu N/C, respectively (Figure S11), since such motifs are proved to be active and stable for ORR on M N C catalysts.[32–34] As shown in Figure S12a and b, the O2 molecules adsorbed on Ni-N4 and Cu-N4 centers are both in the end-on configuration, and their adsorption free energies (ΔGO2\*) are 0.015 eV and 0.017 eV, respectively, which indicates the weak physical adsorption.[35] In contrast, the configuration of O2 on Ni Cu N6 shows that O2 molecule bonds with both Ni and Cu atom (Figure S12c). This bridge-cis adsorption geometry highly improves the interaction between O2 and the active site with ΔGO2\* of 0.823 eV, which will promote the activation of O2 on the active center and facilitate the following ORR processes.[36] Following the previous reports,[37–39] four elementary reaction steps are involved in ORR pathway in which the absorbed O2 is first reduced to OOH\*, followed by further reduction to O\*, OH\* and OH (Figure 5a). Figure 5b displays the free energy profiles of ORR pathways on the three catalytic sites at U=1.23 V (vs RHE) and pH=13. The rate determining step (RDS) for Ni N4 is the formation of O\* with an energy barrier of 0.69 eV, and the protonation of O2 also suffers from a large energy barrier. The ORR on Cu-N4 is limited by the first step with an energy barrier of 0.75 eV. For Ni Cu N6, the RDS of ORR pathway is the last step with an energy barrier of 0.63 eV. According to the calculated energy barriers of the RDS, it is suggested the ORR capability trend follows the order of Cu N4*<*Ni N4*<*Ni Cu N6, confirming the synergistic effect of bimetallic Ni/Cu to promote the ORR activity. In addition, since Ni Cu N6 has strong adsorption of ORR intermediates, the generation of OOH will be restrained, which favors the direct four-electron process.[40] Figure 5c displays the free energy profiles of two-electron ORR at U= 0.75 V (vs RHE) on Ni N4, Cu N4, and Ni Cu N6 sites. The energy barrier of the two-electron ORR towards OOH follows the order of Ni N4 (0.20 eV)*<*Cu N4 (0.27 eV)*<*Ni Cu N6 (0.39 eV), indicating that Ni Cu N6 site has the highest selectivity of towards the four-electron ORR pathway. The above results suggest the synergistic effect of Ni and Cu in Ni Cu N6 species to promote the ORR activity as well as the improved four-electron ORR selectivity.

#### **3. Conclusions**

In summary, we have presented a facile method for the synthesis of bimetallic Ni/Cu incorporated N-doped porous carbon catalysts by a direct carbonization of the metal-organic complexes. The composition, morphology, specific surface area, and the ORR activity were modulated by tuning the Ni/Cu ratio

in the catalysts. Among the studied Ni1-xCux-N C catalysts, Ni0.7Cu0.3-N C exhibits the best ORR activity with an onset potential of 0.872 V and a four-electron transfer ORR pathway in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte. Both experimental and theoretical investigations suggest the dual-metal Ni Cu sites are effective to promote the ORR activity and improve the four-electron pathway selectivity.

# **Comprehensive Summary**

Dual-atom catalysts (DACs) show attractive prospects for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), yet face challenges in precise charge modulation that balances the activity and durability. Herein, we present a N,S-coordinated Fe dual atomic catalyst modified by Fe3C nanoclusters (Fe3C/Fe2N*x*S) through pyrolyzing the mixtures of ZIF-8-encapsulated iron dimers and sulfur-doped C3N4. Aberration-corrected STEM and synchrotron X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) validated that the catalyst was composed of Fe dual atomic sites and Fe3C nanoclusters, in which Fe dual atoms were coordinated by five N atoms and one S atom. Fe3C/Fe2N*x*S exhibited excellent ORR activity in alkaline media, displaying a high half-wave potential (*E*1/2 = 0.894 V *vs*. RHE) with near 4e‒ selectivity (*n* = 3.92) and maintaining 86.8% retention after 20000 s, superior to commercial Pt/C. Impressively, the assembled zinc-air battery delivered exceptional peak power density (163 mW·cm ‒2 ) and 200-hour robust stability. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that electron transfer from Fe of Fe2N*x*S to neighboring Fe3C induced local charge asymmetry, shifting the d-band center closer to Fermi level, thereby enhancing O<sup>2</sup> activation. Moreover, the OOH*\** formation energy barrier was reduced to 0.52 eV in Fe3C/Fe2N*x*S, accelerating ORR reaction kinetics. This work establishes nanocluster-mediated electronic redistribution to tailor charge asymmetry for high-performance electrocatalysts.

#### **Background and Originality Content**

Amid escalating environmental pollution and dwindling fossil fuel reserves. [1-3] metal-air batteries emerged as promising alternatives due to their high energy density, abundant resources and environmental compatibility. [4-5] Among these systems, zinc-air batteries (ZABs) have attracted considerable concern owing to their stable discharge platform, <sup>[6]</sup> exceptional theoretical energy density (1218 Wh·kg<sup>-1</sup>), asymmetric electron distribution and zero-carbon emission characteristics.<sup>[7]</sup> However, the practical application of ZABs still suffers from sluggish kinetics of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) occurring at the cathode, which involves complex multi-electron transfer processes and necessitates highefficient electrocatalysts to mitigate excessive overpotentials. 12 Although platinum-based catalysts exhibit superior intrinsic activity, [10-12] their widespread commercialization is impeded by prohibitive costs, resource scarcity, and insufficient durability under operating conditions. Single-atom catalysts (SACs), especially those with Fe-N<sub>4</sub> configurations, have stimulated wide research enthusiasm to replace Pt-based catalysts due to their near-100% atomic utilization efficiency and preferential 4e ORR pathway. [13-14] Nevertheless, isolated Fe-N<sub>4</sub> sites typically exhibit rigid single-site adsorption mode, leading to non-optimized binding energies for multiple oxygen intermediates (O<sub>2</sub>\*, OOH\*, O\*, OH\*). This fundamentally hinders the reaction kinetics and intrinsic catalvtic activity. [15-16] Dual-atom catalysts (DACs), which perfectly integrate the merits of single-atom catalysts (SACs) through closely spaced dual-metal sites, exhibit superior tunability in both activity and stability of catalytic centers. [17-19] Moreover, DACs catalysts enable cooperative adsorption-activation of O2 molecules via dual-site bridge adsorption mode, with each metal site independently driving distinct key reaction steps. [20-21] Furthermore, one metal site can act as an electronic-modulator to subtly regulate the electronic structure of the adjacent metal active center, thereby optimizing adsorption energetics of oxygen-containing intermediates. [22-23] These unique features confer DACs with distinct advantages for multi-step proton-coupled electron transfer processes involved in ORR. Recent studies have demonstrated that Fe-based DACs outperform their single-atom counterparts under both acidic and alkaline conditions. [24-25] However, conventional Fe DACs typically rely on nitrogen coordination, which creates a highly symmetric electronic environment around the active centers. This often leads to excessively strong \*OH binding, resulting in sluggish desorption and limiting ORR kinetics.  $^{\!\![26\text{-}29]}$ 

To circumvent this limitation, strategic substitution of nitrogen  $(\chi = 3.04)$  with less electronegative heteroatoms (e.g., P, S, Se, etc.) has emerged as an effective strategy for tailoring charge distribution. [30-33] Such electronic tailoring is regarded to effectively weaken the \*OH adsorption strength, thereby facilitating ratelimiting desorption step and enhancing ORR kinetics. For instance, Fe<sub>2</sub>N<sub>5</sub>P dual atom sites modified via P doping (Fe<sub>2</sub>@P-HC) exhibited significantly enhanced ORR activity compared to the symmetric Fe₂NC configuration. [34] Particularly, compared to the lower electronegative heteroatoms such as phosphorus ( $\chi$  = 2.19), sulfur with moderate electronegativity ( $\chi$  = 2.58) enables subtle and controllable charge redistribution at Fe dual sites, resulting in optimized \*OH desorption kinetics. Li et al. [35] demonstrated that charge-asymmetric Fe dual atom sites Fe<sub>2</sub>-S<sub>1</sub>N<sub>5</sub> anchored on hollow porous carbon spheres exhibited remarkable ORR activity even in acidic media, underscoring the effectiveness of N, S co-coordination in dual-site regulation. In addition, emerging evidence suggests that adjacent metal nanoclusters can synergistically reconfigure the local electronic structure of single atomic sites. [36-38] Notably, Wang et al. [39] found that the adjacent Co<sub>4</sub> clusters surrounding Fe-N<sub>4</sub> single-atom sites promoted ORR activity and durability through interfacial charge redistribution. Analogously, Fe nanoclusters have been reported to disrupt symmetric

coordination geometries, optimizing Fe-site configurations for improved catalytic performance. [40] Despite these advances, most existing studies have focused on either heteroatom doping or nanocluster-assisted modulation individually. However, the synergistic interaction between nanoclusters and heteroatom coordination, particularly N, S co-coordination, in regulating the ORR activity and durability of Fe dual-atom sites remains largely unexplored.

Herein, we synthesized multi-atomic Fe nanoclusters-modified Fe<sub>2</sub>N<sub>5</sub>S dual-atomic catalyst (denoted as Fe<sub>3</sub>C/Fe<sub>2</sub>N<sub>x</sub>S) embedded in N,S-codoped carbon matrices via pyrolysis of ZIF-8@Fe2 precursors with sulfur-doped C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>. During thermal treatment, part of Fe species evolved into atomically dispersed Fe<sub>2</sub>N<sub>x</sub>S sites, while some residual Fe aggregated into carbon-encapsulated Fe multiatomic clusters. Aberration-corrected STEM and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) results collectively confirmed the coexistence of Fe multi-atomic nanoclusters and Fe<sub>2</sub>N<sub>5</sub>S dual sites within the carbon matrix. The optimized Fe<sub>3</sub>C/Fe<sub>2</sub>N<sub>x</sub>S catalysts delivered a remarkable half-wave potential (0.894 V) in 0.1 M KOH, outperforming  $Fe_2N_x/C$  catalyst (0.88 V), commercial Pt/C (0.85 V) and other state-of-the-art catalysts. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the Fe<sub>3</sub>C clusters induced localized charge asymmetry of Fe<sub>2</sub>N<sub>5</sub>S<sub>1</sub> dual atomic sites via directional electron transfer from Fe<sub>2</sub>N<sub>5</sub>S<sub>1</sub> to adjacent Fe<sub>3</sub>C nanoclusters, optimizing the Fe-3d orbital d-band centers and reducing reaction energy barrier. Specifically, the asymmetric charge configuration enhanced O2 adsorption at the Fe-Fe dual sites and weakened OH\* binding energy, thereby synergistically accelerating both OOH\* formation and OH\* desorption kinetics. More importantly, the as-assembled Zn-air battery achieved a maximum peak power density of 163 mW/cm<sup>2</sup> and a cycle life up to 200 h, demonstrating significant potential for clean energy applications.

#### **Results and Discussion**

Initially, the ZIF-8@Fe2-dimer precursors were fabricated via a nanoconfinement strategy, in which dicarbonyl-cyclopentadienyl iron dimers  $[(C_5H_5)2Fe_2(CO)_4]$  were uniformly confined within ZIF-8. The resulting material was mixed with porous lamellar structured S-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> (Figure S1a) and subjected to controlled pyrolysis to yield the Fe<sub>3</sub>C/Fe<sub>2</sub>N<sub>x</sub>S composite. During the pyrolysis process, ZIF-8 frameworks underwent progressive carbonization into N,S-doped porous carbon skeleton, accompanied by the evaporation of zinc species and the decomposition/etching of S-CN<sub>x</sub> fragments. Simultaneously, the confined Fe<sub>2</sub>-dimer experienced structural reconstruction and was in-situ transformed into atomically dispersed Fe<sub>2</sub>N<sub>x</sub>S dual atomic sites, while residual Fe species were converted into graphitic carbon-encapsulated Fe<sub>3</sub>C clusters. For comparison, the control sample Fe<sub>2</sub>N<sub>x</sub>/C was also synthesized under identical conditions without introduction of S-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>, and the obtained Fe<sub>2</sub>N<sub>x</sub>/C materials retained the initial rhombic dodecahedral morphology (ca. 120 nm) (Figure S1b). However, the Fe<sub>3</sub>C/Fe<sub>2</sub>N<sub>x</sub>S catalyst exhibited a reconstructed architecture comprising interconnected carbon nanotubes (CNTs) wrapped by ultrathin folded layered structures (Figures 1b, c, Figure S1c), signifying profound morphological evolution from the original ZIF-8@ Fe2-dimer precursors. High-resolution TEM (HR-TEM) result further displayed that the carbon frameworks are composed of CNTs, whose thickness is ~2.5 nm, and these CNTs were wound by ultrathin pleated layered structures (Figure 1d). This evolution and reconfiguration of this structure attributed to the decomposition of S-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> and the generated S-CN<sub>x</sub> fragments induced etching of carbon frameworks, leading to localized collapse of carbon structures, followed by subsequent reconstruction. [41] The S-CN<sub>x</sub>-mediated etching process substantially regulated the porous structures, yielding a hierarchical structure composed of abundant mesopores and micropores, along with a high specific surface area  $(S_{BET} = 563.9 \text{ m}^2/\text{g})$  (Figure S2). Abundant defects can be

confirmed by a higher  $I_D/I_G$  ratio (1.04) compared to that of Fe<sub>2</sub>N<sub>x</sub>/C (0.97) for Fe<sub>2</sub>N<sub>x</sub>/C, as revealed by the Raman spectrum (Figure S3).

Aberration-corrected STEM (AC-STEM) imaging directly visualized the coexistence of Fe dual atomic sites (marked in red circles) and Fe nanoclusters (outlined by blue dashed boxes) within the carbon matrix (Figure 1e). [42] Intensity profile analysis of region 1 (Figure 1e) revealed Fe-Fe interatomic distance of 0.28 nm (Figure 1f), close to the distance between iron centers in dicarbonyl(cyclopentadienyl)iron dimers. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mapping confirmed the homogeneous distribution of Fe, N and S elements throughout the carbon framework (Figure 1h). XRD patterns displayed two broad peaks at ~26° and 45° (Figure 1g), indexed to the (002) and (101) planes of graphitic carbon (JCPDS 75-1621). [43] Weak diffraction signatures corresponding to Fe<sub>3</sub>C (JCPDS 35-0772) corroborated the coexistence of atomically dispersed Fe<sub>2</sub>N<sub>x</sub>S sites and polyatomic Fe<sub>3</sub>C clusters, consistent with AC-STEM observations as shown in Figure 1e.

The electronic structure and coordination environment of the Fe center in  ${\rm Fe_3C/Fe_2N_xS}$  were investigated through X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray absorption near-edge struc-

ture (XANES). XPS survey spectra indicated the presence of the Fe, S, N and C (Figure S4), in which the loading of Fe is 1.22 wt% determined by ICP-OES (Table S1). High-resolution Fe 2p spectrum (Figure 2a) exhibits four characteristic peaks at 730.4 eV, 724.3 eV, 716.1 eV and 711.04 eV, corresponding to  $Fe^{3+}$   $2p_{1/2}$ ,  $Fe^{2+}$   $2p_{1/2}$ ,  $Fe^{3+}$   $2p_{3/2}$  and  $Fe^{2+}$   $2p_{3/2}$ , respectively, [44] and no metallic iron signals were detected, indicating the absence of Fe<sup>o</sup> aggregation. Compared with Fe<sub>2</sub>N<sub>x</sub>S/C, Fe<sub>3</sub>C/Fe<sub>2</sub>N<sub>x</sub>S exhibits a positive shift of ~0.2 eV in both  $2p_{3/2}$  and  $2p_{1/2}$  peaks (Figure S5). These features indicate a modified electronic structure due to Fe<sub>3</sub>C incorporation, likely arising from Fe<sub>3</sub>C-Fe<sub>2</sub>N<sub>x</sub>S interfacial charge transfer. N 1s spectrum of Fe<sub>3</sub>C/Fe<sub>2</sub>N<sub>x</sub>S (Figure 2b) deconvoluted into pyridinic N (398.3 eV), Fe-N<sub>x</sub> (399.5 eV), graphitic N (400.85 eV), and oxidized N (403.8 eV). <sup>[45]</sup> Compared with that of Fe<sub>2</sub>N<sub>x</sub>/C sample, Fe<sub>3</sub>C/ Fe<sub>2</sub>N<sub>x</sub>S shows increased relative content of Fe-N<sub>x</sub> species (Table S2), attributed to further reaction between partially decomposed  $\mbox{S-CN}_{\mbox{\scriptsize $\chi$}}$  fragments from  $\mbox{S-C}_3\mbox{N}_4$  and Fe sites. Concurrently, an increase in pyridinic N species suggests the formation of more active N sites. The S 2p spectrum (Figure 2c) reveals characteristic peaks at 161.8 eV (Fe-S), 163.83/165.13 eV (C-S-C), and 168.01/

168.87 eV (C-SO<sub>x</sub>-C), <sup>[46-48]</sup> confirming successful sulfur doping into the carbon framework. C 1s spectrum presents representative peaks of C-C (284.7 eV), pyrrolic C=S (285.5 eV), O-C=O (288.2 eV) and  $\pi$ - $\pi$ \* structures (291.4 eV) (Figure S6). <sup>[49]</sup> The characteristic C=S peak further confirms S doping. ICP-OES confirmed that the sulfur content in the Fe<sub>3</sub>C/Fe<sub>2</sub>N<sub>x</sub>S catalyst reached 0.15% (Table S1). The electron-withdrawing effect of sulfur in the C=S bond could induce localized electron redistribution around the Fe dual sites, modifying their electronic configuration and d-band center. This modulation likely optimizes O<sub>2</sub> adsorption and intermediate desorption at FeN<sub>x</sub>S sites, enhancing ORR kinetics.

The chemical state and coordination environment of Fe were elucidated using synchrotron-based X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). Fe<sub>3</sub>C/Fe<sub>2</sub>N<sub>x</sub>S was analyzed in depth with reference to the X-ray absorption spectra (XAS) of Fe foil, Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, FePc and FeS. The normalized X-ray absorption near-edge spectrum (XANES) of Fe<sub>2</sub>N<sub>x</sub>S shows an absorption edge energy between those of Fe foil and FePc (Figure 2d), indicating an average Fe oxidation state between 0 and +2 (0 <  $\delta$  < +2). Fourier transform (FT) k2-weighted EXAFS spectra in R-space provide local structural information around Fe. In the EXAFS spectra (Figure 2e), two typical peaks can be detected, one of which is located at 1.933 Å assigned to Fe-N, and Fe-S scattering paths<sup>[51-52]</sup> and the other one around 2.2 Å corresponds to Fe-Fe bond (Figure S7). The FT-EXAFS curve-fitting results (Figure 2f, Table S3) show that the Fe-N exhibits a coordination number of 5 and the bond length of 1.933 Å, and Fe-S coordination number of ~1 with a bond length of 2.80 Å in the  $Fe_3C/Fe_2N_xS$ . This suggests a  $Fe_2N_5S_1$  coordination structure for the dual Fe sites.

Electrocatalytic activity was evaluated under  $O_2$  saturated 0.1 M KOH electrolyte using rotating disk electrode (RDE) and rotating ring disk (RRDE) electrode. All potentials were referenced to the

reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) test results (Figure 3a) firstly reveal that Fe<sub>3</sub>C/Fe<sub>2</sub>N<sub>x</sub>S exhibits superior ORR electrocatalytic activity, achieving the highest halfwave potential ( $E_{1/2}$  = 0.894 V), which outperforms those of  $Fe_2N_x/C$  (0.880 V),  $Fe_3C/Fe_2N_xC$  (0.864 V) and the commercial 20 wt% Pt/C (0.85 V). This highlights the regulating effect of Fe<sub>3</sub>C and S doping in enhancing ORR activity. Tafel slope determined from the LSV curve is an important index to assess ORR kinetics. Fe<sub>3</sub>C/Fe<sub>2</sub>N<sub>v</sub>S displays the lowest Tafel plot slope (69.87 mV·dec<sup>-1</sup>) (Figure 3b), indicative of the most favorable ORR kinetics. Meanwhile,  $Fe_3C/Fe_2N_xS$  achieves a higher kinetic current density of  $J_k$  = 20.28 mA·cm<sup>-2</sup> at 0.85 V (Figure 3c), significantly outperforming Pt/C catalyst (6.6 mA·cm<sup>-2</sup>) and most pioneer Fe based catalysts (Table S4), confirming its superior reaction kinetics. In addition, the electron transfer number (n) and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> yield of catalysts were determined from RRDE measurements. Within the potential range of 0.2-0.8 V, Fe<sub>3</sub>C/Fe<sub>2</sub>N<sub>x</sub>S exhibited the lowest H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> yield (3%-5%) and the highest electron transfer number (3.86-4.00) (Figure 3d), indicating high ORR selectivity towards 4e process. Polarization curve measurements at different rotational speeds (400-2025 r/min) revealed an average electron transfer number of 3.92 calculated using the K-L equation, further corroborating the dominant four-electron transfer pathway.

Electrocatalytic stability of the catalyst was evaluated by chronoamperometry (CA). As shown in Figure 3e,  $Fe_3C/Fe_2N_xS$  manifests preferable long-term stability, retaining 86.6% of its initial current after 20000 s. In addition, the methanol tolerance was also measured by infusing methanol solution during the chronoamperometric test. After methanol addition for 500 s,  $Fe_3C/Fe_2N_xS$  retained 97.4% of its initial current, significantly higher than that of Pt/C (55.6%) (Figure 3e). This confirms the superior methanol tolerance of  $Fe_3C/Fe_2N_xS$  over that of Pt/C.

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were conducted to understand the electronic structures and associated free energies of Fe<sub>2</sub>N<sub>x</sub>S and Fe<sub>3</sub>C/Fe<sub>2</sub>N<sub>x</sub>S, elucidating differences in their oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) mechanisms. The initial step involved constructing the Fe<sub>3</sub>C/Fe<sub>2</sub>N<sub>x</sub>S composite. This was achieved by integrating the well-established Fe<sub>3</sub>C and Fe<sub>2</sub>N<sub>6</sub> structures. [53-54] The atomic-scale composite structure of Fe<sub>3</sub>C/Fe<sub>2</sub>N<sub>x</sub>S, depicted in Figure 4a, was fully relaxed and structurally optimized. To validate the stability of Fe<sub>3</sub>C/Fe<sub>2</sub>N<sub>x</sub>S, molecular dynamics simulations were performed at room temperature (300 K) using the canonical NVT ensemble. Over the course of a 5000-fs simulation, the composite remained intact, showing no significant structural or energy fluctuations, nor any broken bonds, confirming that Fe<sub>3</sub>C/Fe<sub>2</sub>N<sub>x</sub>S is dynamically stable and highly reliable for subsequent calculations.

The intrinsic ORR activities of Fe<sub>2</sub>N<sub>x</sub>S and Fe<sub>3</sub>C/Fe<sub>2</sub>N<sub>x</sub>S were initially evaluated by comparing their Fe-3d orbital d-band centers gained from their total DOS and pDOS characteristics. The d-band center position generally serves as a quantitative descriptor for catalytic activity. [55] The results indicate that the d-band center of Fe-3d in Fe<sub>3</sub>C/Fe<sub>2</sub>N<sub>x</sub>S is closer to the Fermi level ( $E_f$ ) compared to that in  $Fe_2N_xS$  (-1.465 vs. -1.504 eV) (Figure 4b). This suggests that the incorporation of Fe<sub>3</sub>C in Fe<sub>3</sub>C/Fe<sub>2</sub>N<sub>x</sub>S effectively tunes its electronic structure, enhancing adsorbate activation. Importantly, this trend aligns with Bader charge analysis, revealing a net electron transfer from Fe in Fe<sub>2</sub>N<sub>x</sub>S to neighboring atoms in Fe<sub>3</sub>C/ Fe<sub>2</sub>N<sub>x</sub>S. To clarify the influence of Fe<sub>3</sub>C and understand why Fe<sub>3</sub>C/Fe<sub>2</sub>N<sub>x</sub>S exhibits superior catalytic performance, a charge density difference (CDD) analysis was performed. This analysis provides a qualitative view of the charge transfer within Fe<sub>3</sub>C/ Fe<sub>2</sub>N<sub>x</sub>S, as the charge distribution offers insights into the macroscopic characteristics of the composite structure. Figure S13 and Figure 4c present the results obtained by subtracting the charges of Fe<sub>3</sub>C and Fe<sub>2</sub>N<sub>x</sub>S from the overall structure, revealing a clear charge separation and transfer. The Bader charge analysis confirms that the amount of electron transfer from Fe in Fe<sub>2</sub>N<sub>x</sub>S to neighboring atoms in  $Fe_3C/Fe_2N_xS$  is -1.771 e. [56-57] This calculation aligns with the 2D CDD plots, demonstrating that the inclusion of Fe<sub>3</sub>C can effectively tailor the electronic structure of the active sites. Gibbs free energy ( $\Delta G$ ) calculations elucidated mechanistic differences, revealing distinct activity trends between Fe<sub>2</sub>N<sub>2</sub>S and Fe<sub>3</sub>C/Fe<sub>2</sub>N<sub>2</sub>S heterojunctions. These calculations are based on the commonly accepted four-electron process as presented in Figure 4a. [58] The free energy diagrams in Figure 4d show that the energy pathways for Fe sites in both Fe<sub>2</sub>N<sub>2</sub>S and Fe<sub>3</sub>C/ Fe<sub>2</sub>N<sub>2</sub>S at U = 0 V are similar, indicating spontaneous exothermic processes. For Fe<sub>2</sub>N<sub>x</sub>S at U = 0.455 V, the fourth electron transfer step shows the highest free energy difference ( $\Delta G_{\text{max}} = 0.74 \text{ eV}$ ), indicating that the OH\* desorption from the Fe site is the ratedetermining step (RDS) and limiting ORR kinetics. [59-60] In contrast. the energy barrier for Fe<sub>3</sub>C/Fe<sub>2</sub>N<sub>x</sub>S exhibits a significantly lower RDS energy barrier ( $\Delta G_{\text{max}} = 0.52 \text{ eV}$ ). [61] This reduction indicates that Fe in Fe<sub>3</sub>C/Fe<sub>2</sub>N<sub>2</sub>S is more thermodynamically favorable for ORR, facilitating easier desorption of OH\* and boosting its intrinsic activity. [62-63] Overall, the analysis supports that Fe<sub>3</sub>C incorporated Fe<sub>2</sub>N<sub>x</sub>S exhibits superior ORR catalytic activity compared to Fe<sub>2</sub>N<sub>2</sub>S.

To experimentally support the DFT-predicted ORR pathway, in-situ attenuated total reflectance-surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR-SEIRAS) was conducted on Fe<sub>3</sub>C/ Fe<sub>2</sub>N<sub>x</sub>S in O<sub>2</sub>-saturated 0.1 M KOH. As shown in Figures 4e-f, an absorption peak at ~1250 cm<sup>-1</sup> corresponding to \*OOH was observed at a potential of 1.1 V vs. RHE for the Fe<sub>3</sub>C/Fe<sub>2</sub>N<sub>x</sub>S catalyst (Figures 4e and 4f). [64] As the potential decreased, the intensity of this peak increased, indicating that \*OOH is the dominant intermediate in the ORR. Concurrently, another characteristic band at ~1620 cm<sup>-1</sup> assigned to H-O-H bending vibrations becomes increasingly prominent (Figures 4g-h), reflecting the accumulation of hydroxyl species from \*OOH dissociation. These spectral features are consistent with a 4e<sup>-</sup> ORR pathway and correlate well with the DFT-derived free energy diagram (Figure 4d), which predicts a low energy barrier ( $\Delta G_{*OOH} = 0.52$  eV at U = 0.455 V) for \*OOH cleavage. Together, the experimental and theoretical results provide compelling evidence for a favorable \*OOH-mediated ORR mechanism on Fe<sub>3</sub>C/Fe<sub>2</sub>N<sub>x</sub>S.

To evaluate the practical application potential of Fe<sub>3</sub>C/Fe<sub>2</sub>N<sub>x</sub>S, an aqueous Zn-air battery (ZAB) was constructed with Fe<sub>3</sub>C/Fe<sub>2</sub>N<sub>x</sub>S as air cathode and zinc foil as anode. A reference ZAB using commercial Pt/C+RuO<sub>2</sub> benchmark catalysts was simultaneously constructed for comparative evaluation. As illustrated in Figure 5a, the Fe<sub>3</sub>C/Fe<sub>2</sub>N<sub>x</sub>S-based ZAB achieved a higher open-circuit voltage (OCV) of 1.54 V, outperforming the Pt/C+RuO<sub>2</sub> counterpart (1.50 V). Furthermore, the Fe<sub>3</sub>C/Fe<sub>2</sub>N<sub>x</sub>S-ZAB delivered a maximum power density of 163 mW·cm<sup>-2</sup>, significantly exceeding 142 mW·cm<sup>-2</sup> of the Pt/C+RuO<sub>2</sub>-ZAB (Figure 5b). Two ZABs in series can power one LED display screen as displayed in Figure S14. The trapezoidal discharge curves (Figure 5c) demonstrate that the

Fe $_3$ C/Fe $_2$ N $_x$ S-ZAB maintains a substantially higher discharge plateau than the Pt/C+RuO $_2$ -ZAB, and it remains stable when returning to 2 mA·cm $^{-2}$ . Energy storage performance shows that Fe $_3$ C/Fe $_2$ N $_x$ S-ZAB delivered a specific capacity of 662 mAh·g $^{-1}$  (Figure 5d), representing 15.1% improvement over the Pt/C+RuO $_2$ -ZAB (575 mAh·g $^{-1}$ ). More importantly, the Fe $_3$ C/Fe $_2$ N $_x$ S based ZAB exhibited a significantly smaller voltage gap (1.18 V) after 200 h of continuous cycling at 10 mA·cm $^{-2}$ , and remained high round-trip efficiency of 52.83% and 53.36% after cycling for 100 h and 200 h, respectively (Figure 5e). Post-cycling structural analysis by XRD (Figure S15) confirmed that the dominant crystalline phases, particularly the Fe $_3$ C nanoclusters, remained intact after operation for

200 h, indicating excellent structural stability of the catalyst. These results collectively demonstrate the exceptional durability and electrochemical performance of the Fe3C/Fe2N*x*S catalyst, underscoring its strong potential for practical zinc–air battery applications.

## **Conclusions**

In summary, asymmetric Fe dual atomic catalyst was successfully constructed through the introduction of adjacent Fe₃C clusters via electronic engineering. Atomic-resolution STEM and XAS analyses confirmed the coexistence of N,S-coordinated Fe dual sites (Fe2N5S1) and adjacent Fe3C clusters within the hierarchically porous carbon matrix. The catalyst exhibited exceptional ORR activity with a half-wave potential of 0.894 V (vs. RHE) with a kinetic current density (*J*<sup>k</sup> ) of 20.28 mA·cm −2 , while maintaining 86% stability after 20000 s in alkaline medium, surpassing that of 20%Pt/C (*E*1/2 = 0.85 V, *J*<sup>k</sup> = 6.6 mA·cm −2 , stability = 67.5%). The as-assembled Zn-air batteries with the Fe3C/Fe2N*x*S achieved outstanding peak power density (163 mW·cm −2 ) and robust durability over 200 h, significantly superior to Pt+RuO<sup>2</sup> benchmarks. DFT calculations revealed that the Fe3C clusters induced localized charge asymmetry in Fe2N*x*S dual sites through directional electron transfer. This simultaneously upshifted the Fe-3d d-band center toward Fermi level, optimized O<sup>2</sup> adsorption configurations and reduced the rate-determining OH\* desorption barrier. This work emphasizes the importance of breaking charge symmetry in enhancing the ORR activity of dual atom catalysts. The strategy provides a universal design principle for non-precious metal-based dual-atom catalysts, advancing their applications in energy conversion technologies.

#### **Experimental**

## **Chemicals and reagents**

All of the chemical reagents were used as received without any further purification. Cyclopentadienyliron dicarbonyl dimer (98%) (Macklin), 2-methylimidazole (98%) (Macklin), zinc nitrate hexahydrate (98%) (Macklin), potassium hydroxide (95%) (Macklin), urea (99%) (Macklin), thiourea (99%), ammonium chloride (99.5%), methanol (99.5%) (Macklin), ethanol (99.5%) (Macklin), Nafion solution (5%), commercial Pt/C (20 wt%), commercial RuO<sup>2</sup> (99.9%) (Macklin) and deionized water (Mill Q, 18.2 MO) were used.

#### **Synthesis of catalysts**

**Synthesis of S-C3N<sup>4</sup> and C3N4.** C3N<sup>4</sup> was synthesized by referring to our previous reported method. [65] Concretely, the urea (10 g) and NH4Cl (2 g) were ground and mixed in a mortar for 30 min, then transferred into a crucible, and heated in a muffle furnace with a temperature climb rate of 5 °C/min to 450 °C and kept it for 2 h, and then cooled naturally to room temperature to obtain the porous nanosheet-like C3N4. S-doped C3N<sup>4</sup> (denoted as S-C3N4) was also prepared in a similar process, except the urea was replaced by thiourea.

**Synthesis of ZIF-8@Fe2-dimer precursor.** Dicarbonyl cyclopentadienyl iron dimer (0.3 mmol) and zinc nitrate hexahydrate (5 mmol, 1.5025 g) were dissolved in 50 mL of methanol and stirred at 400 r/min at room temperature for 30 min to obtain a clear solution A. Separately, 2-methylimidazole (20 mmol, 1.6755 g) was dissolved in 50 mL of methanol under the same stirring conditions to form solution B. Subsequently, solution A was slowly dropped to solution B, followed by ultrasonication for 10 min and vigorous stirring at 70 °C (400 r/min) for 30 min. The resulting mixture was then continuously stirred at 250 r/min at room temperature for an additional 8 h. The pink precipitate obtained was collected by centrifugation, washed several times with methanol, and dried under vacuum at 60 °C for 12 h to yield the ZIF-8@Fe2 dimer precursor.

**Synthesis of Fe3C/Fe2N***x***S.** The S-C3N<sup>4</sup> and ZIF-8@Fe2-dimer precursor were mixed at a mass ratio of 3 : 1 in 20 mL ethanol and stirred vigorously at 500 r/min at room temperature for 4 h. The resulting suspension was then ultrasonicated for 1 h to ensure complete homogenization, followed by vacuum drying at 60 °C for 12 h. The dried mixture was subsequently pyrolyzed in a tube furnace at 900 °C for 2 h under N₂ atmosphere, with a heating rate of 5 °C·min⁻;, to obtain the final Fe3C/Fe2N*x*S catalyst. For comparison, the Fe₂N*ₓ*/C catalyst and the Fe₂N*ₓ*S/C catalyst were also synthesized using the same process. However, the former did not add S-C3N4, while the latter only added S-C3N<sup>4</sup> as an additional nitrogen source through a one-step pyrolysis process.

#### **Physical characterization**

Crystalline phases of samples were identified using a Bruker D2 PHASER X-ray diffractometer (Cu-Kα *λ* = 0.15148 nm, 30 kV, 20.0 mA). The microstructural features were examined by using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, Tecnai G20, FEI Company, USA) at an accelerating voltage of 200.0 kV. Raman spectra were recorded using a DXR Raman spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Co., USA) equipped with a 532 nm diode laser at a power of 40 mW. Nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms were measured at 77.4 K using the TriStar II Plus 2.02 system (Micromeritics Instrument Corp., USA). The specific surface area and pore size distribution were calculated employing the Brunauer– Emmett–Teller (BET, 3H-2000PM2 BeiShiDe Instrument Technology) method and the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) model. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed on an ESCALAB 250 XI X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Co., USA). XAFS spectra at Fe K-edge were obtained from 1W1B station in Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility (BSRF, performed at 2.5 GeV with a maximum current of 250 mA). Metal contents in the catalysts were quantified using an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES, Varian 710).

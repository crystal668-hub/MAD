A series of porous N-doped carbon electrocatalysts decorated with Cu and Fe3C, namely Cu/Fe3C/N C-x-T (T=temperature, and x=Cu/Fe molar ratio), have been prepared for oxygen reduction by pyrolysis of trimetallic Cu/Fe/Zn MOF (MOF= Metal-Organic Framework) precursors with variable Cu/Fe molar ratio. It reveals that the Cu/Fe molar ratio has a great impact not only on the morphologies of Cu/Fe3C/N C-x-T electrocatalysts but also on the catalytic performance toward oxygen

reduction. In 0.1 M KOH solution, the optimal Cu/Fe3C/N C-1- 1000 electrocatalyst can compete with the Pt/C benchmark, showing *E*onset (onset potential) of 0.95 V (vs. RHE) and *E*1/2 (halfwave potential) of 0.85 V (vs. RHE) (RHE=Reversible Hydrogen Electrode). Zinc-air battery with Cu/Fe3C/N C-1-1000 as the cathode also delivers a maximal power density of 90 mW.cm <sup>2</sup> , and demonstrates a little decay in potential after running for 40 hrs at 20 mA.cm <sup>2</sup> .

## **1. Introduction**

The current fossil fuel-based economic growth is facing the increasing double challenges from both the energy depletion and environmental deterioration, urgently demanding to develop sustainable and green energy conversion devices such as fuel cells, zinc-air batteries, and sodium or lithium-ion batteries.[1–7] Thanks to the outstanding electrocatalytic performances toward oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), iron and nitrogen co-doped carbon (Fe N C) materials have held great promise to replace the scarce and expensive platinum group metals (PGMs) in the future, which currently constitute the major bottleneck for large-scale application of fuel cells and zinc-air batteries.[1–2] Despite significant breakthroughs in this field, it is still a long way for Fe N C electrocatalysts to challenge the PGMs.[8–11]

Generally, the ORR catalytic performance of Fe N C electrocatalysts can be optimized by regulating the key ORR-dependent factors through different strategies,[12] such as improving the intrinsic activity by tuning the energetic state of 3d electrons in the Fe centers,[13–15] enhancing the density of Fecentered catalytic species (e.g. Fe Nx, Fe3C) by enriching micropores,[16–19] or developing a hierarchical porous structure to ensure rapid mass transfer.[20–23] Among various optimizing strategies, introducing a secondary metal atom into the Fe N C electrocatalysts offers an attractive route to enable a simultaneous modulation on both the active sites and carbon matrix. A number of seminal research works have unveiled that co-integration of a second metal heteroatom (M) with the Fe atom into the carbon matrix via thermal treatment could bring about fundamental changes in both active sites and carbon matrix which encompass but not limited to the following[24–31] (i) creating highly active dual-metal active sites or Fe/M alloy nanoparticles with great synergism toward ORR; (ii) changing the carbon morphology; (iii) modulating the carbon textures (e.g. porosity, surface area and electronic conduction); (iv) altering the type and concentration of doped N atoms. However, the secondary metal effect seems multivariate and intricate which commonly varies dramatically from metal to metal. Therefore, better understanding of the roles of the secondary metal remains explored to make the secondarymetal-optimizing strategy a powerful tool to tailor the catalytic performances of Fe N C electrocatalysts.

Among various choices of second metal, Cu heteroatom has sparked considerable interest due to its unique catalytic or promoting role toward ORR.[27,32–43] For instance, Wang's group designed an outstanding Cu Fe N C electrocatalyst simulating the cytochrome c oxidase (CcO), in which the Cu-Nx active site exhibits synergism with the Fe Nx active site during ORR.[27] Mu's team reported a Cu, Fe-embedded carbon composite (Cu@Fe N C) from ZIF-8 (ZIF=Zeolitic Imidazolate Frameworks), which shows a superior ORR performance over the Fe N C counterpart owing to the multiple roles of Cu atom.[40] In this context, MOFs (metal-organic frameworks) precursors offer an ideal platform to elucidate the secondary metal role compared to other precursors owing to their crystalline nature, well-defined framework structure and easy modification.[44] With the three-dimension ordered framework structure of MOFs, it renders fine tuning of the distribution and concentration of multiple metal ions easier, which is conductive to better correlate the precursor-structure and the electrocatalytic properties of materials. However, MOFs used in this scenario seem yet limited to ZIFs, and non-ZIF MOFs are likely to offer additional insights about the roles of secondary Cu atom given that totally different composition, structure/topology as well as chemical/physical properties. In light of the above reasons, as continuation of our previous research[45–49] we herein employed Fe/Cu/Zn trimetallic metal-organic-frameworks (MOFs) (namely

Cu/Fe/Zn-MOF-x) built by mixed ligands of TTPA (TTPA = tris(4(4H-1,2,4-triazol-4-yl)phenyl)amine) and TPA (TPA = terephthalic acid) as the precursors, and investigate the impacts of Cu on these MOF-derived carbon electrocatalysts (designated as Cu/Fe<sub>3</sub>C/N-C-x-T, where T stands for the pyrolysis temperature, and x is Cu/Fe molar ratio) (Scheme 1). It demonstrates that the Cu/Fe molar ratio has a profound impact on the morphology of the resultant Cu/Fe<sub>3</sub>C/N-C-x-T. By tuning the Cu/Fe molar ratio and the annealing temperature, the best Cu/Fe<sub>3</sub>C/N-C-1-1000 electrocatalyst can compete with the Pt/C benchmark toward ORR, showing 0.95 V (vs. RHE) of  $E_{onset}$  (onset potential) and 0.85 V (vs. RHE) of  $E_{1/2}$  (half-wave potential) (RHE=Reversible Hydrogen Electrode) in 0.1 M KOH solution. Zinc-air battery with Cu/Fe<sub>3</sub>C/N-C-1-1000 as the cathode also achieves a peak power density of 90 mW.cm<sup>-2</sup>, and shows little reduction in potential for 40 hrs at 20 mA.cm<sup>-2</sup>.

#### **Experimental Section**

#### Materials and chemicals

TTPA ligand was synthesized according to our reported method.<sup>[50]</sup> All reagents for synthesis of MOFs precursor are in analytical grade, and used as received without further purification.

#### Preparation of trimetallic Cu/Fe/Zn-MOF-x precursors

Typically, mixed metal salts comprising zinc nitrate hexahydrate, copper (II) nitrate hexahydrate, and iron (III) nitrate nonahydrate were dissolved in the mixed solvent of DMF and  $H_2O$ , in which the total molar percentage of  $\text{Cu}^{2+}$  and  $\text{Fe}^{3+}$  ions is kept at  $5\,\%$  but with varying  $\text{Cu}^{2+}/\text{Fe}^{3+}$  molar ratio (x). To the above solution TTPA and TPA were then added and vigorously stirred at  $90\,^\circ\text{C}$  for  $72\,\text{hrs}$ . The powders precipitated from the solution were filtered, and washed with DMF and ethanol to afford Cu/Fe/Zn-MOF-x (x=0.5, 1 and 2). For reference, Cu/Zn-MOF-1 and Fe/Zn-MOF-1 were prepared in an analogous manner.

#### Preparation of Cu/Fe₃C/N-C-x-1000

One-step pyrolysis of Cu/Fe/Zn-MOF-x at 1000  $^{\circ}$ C led to the Cu/Fe<sub>3</sub>C/N–C-x-1000 (x=0.5, 1 and 2). In general, Cu/Fe/Zn-MOF-x (100 mg) was weighed, and heated under the N<sub>2</sub> flow to 1000  $^{\circ}$ C with a ramp of 5  $^{\circ}$ C/min. The given temperature was maintained for

2 hrs. Upon cooled to ambient temperature, the as-prepared black powders, viz.  $Cu/Fe_3C/N-C-x-1000$ , were collected for further test. The temperature-dependent samples of  $Cu/Fe_3C/N-C-1-900$  and  $Cu/Fe_3C/N-C-1-1100$  were prepared analogously. Similarly, Cu/N-C-1000 and  $Fe_3C/N-C-1000$  were afforded under the same condition.

#### Physicochemical characterization

The surface morphologies and microstructures of samples were observed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi S-4800) and transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, JEOL JEM-2100F), respectively. The crystallite structure of the as-prepared products were acquired by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) using Rigaku Corporation diffractometer (Cu-K $\alpha$  radiation,  $\lambda = 1.54056$  Å). Raman spectroscopy measurements were performed on a Thermo DXR 532 Raman spectrometer (USA) at a laser wavelength of 532 nm.  $N_2$  adsorption-desorption isotherms were conducted using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 surface area. The specific surface area and pore size distribution were determined by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) theory and the Barret-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was studied on a Thermo Scientific Spectrometer with an Escalab 250 Xi X-ray.

#### Electrochemical measurements of ORR

All electrochemical performances were performed at room temperature by using a standard three-electrode cell system on the CHI 604E electrochemical workstation. A glassy carbon rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE, SD: 0.2475 cm²) or the rotating disk electrode (RDE, 3 mm in diameter) modified with carbon catalyst served as the working electrode, whereas graphitic rod and Ag/AgCl electrode were employed as the counter and reference electrode in 0.1 M KOH solution, respectively. The Ag/AgCl reference electrode was calibrated according to the literature procedure (Figure S1).<sup>[51]</sup> Prior to catalyst deposition, the RDE electrode and GC electrode were polished carefully with 0.3 and 0.05 µm alumina slurry, respectively, and rinsed with distilled water, followed by sonication in ethanol and water successively.

For the preparation of working electrode, the catalyst ink was obtained by dispersing 6 mg of as-prepared catalyst in a solution of distilled water (0.95 mL) and Nafion (0.05 mL) under sonication. The as-prepared catalyst ink and 20 wt% Pt/C catalyst (Johnson Matthey (UK), Pt nanoparticle size  $<\!3.5$  nm) loading were 0.3 mg cm $^{-2}$  and 0.2 mg cm $^{-2}$ , respectively. Before each measurement, 0.1 M KOH solution was purged at room temperature with high purity  $N_2$  and  $O_2$  for at least 30 minutes to ensure the gas saturation.

According to U.S. Department of Energy protocol, the accelerated durability tests (ADTs) were conducted by recording the LSV curves before and after the potential-cycling between 0.6 and 1.0 V (vs. RHE) at a scan rate of 50 mV s<sup>-1</sup> in O<sub>2</sub>-saturated solution. The methanol tolerance was evaluated by comparing the CV before and after the addition of 2% CH<sub>3</sub>OH to the O<sub>2</sub>-saturated 0.1 M KOH electrolyte. RDE and RRDE experiments were performed in O<sub>2</sub>-saturated 0.1 M KOH at room temperature with a scan rate of 10 mV s<sup>-1</sup> at a rotating speed of 1600 rpm.  $E_{\rm onset}$  was determined at the diffusion current density of 0.1 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, and the potential of Pt ring polarization during RRDE experiment is set to 1.2 V.

RRDE test was applied to determine the four-electron selectivity. The electron transfer capability (n) and the yield of hydrogen peroxide ( $H_2O_2$ %) during the ORR were determined based on the following equation:

$$n = 4 \times I_d / [I_d + (I_r/N)]$$

$$H_2O_2\% = 200 \times \{(I_r/N)/[I_d + (I_r/N)]\}$$

Here,  $I_d$  and  $I_r$  are the disk and ring currents, respectively. The collection efficiency (N) is 0.37 for the Pt ring.

#### Zinc-air battery evaluation

For evaluation of the catalyst's potential application in real devices, a zinc-air battery (ZAB) was assembled. In ZAB, the anode is made of a polished Zn foil, and the air cathode is composed of carbon

fiber paper of  $1.0~\rm cm^2$  coated by Teflon, which is loaded by the carbon catalysts with  $1.0~\rm mg\,cm^{-2}$  loading. The electrolyte of ZAB comprises KOH (6.0 M) solution with zinc acetate (0.2 M). All the data were gathered on the as-fabricated cell at room temperature with a CHI760D electrochemical workstation and LAND testing system.

#### 2. Results and discussion

#### 2.1. Structural characterizations

Scheme 1 depicts the preparation process of trimetallic Cu/Fe/Zn-MOFs, namely Cu/Fe/Zn-MOF-x. Cu/Fe/Zn-MOF-x can be easily obtained by simply mixing the metal salts mixture (Zn(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, Cu(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> and Fe(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>) with mixed ligands (TTPA and TPA) under the gentle heating, wherein the Cu/Fe molar ratio (x) can be varied during the preparation. Cu/Fe/Zn-MOF-x precursors share the same PXRD pattern as the simulated one from Zn-MOF,<sup>[50]</sup> indicative of the crystal lattice of Zn-MOF is compatible with three different metal ions (Figure 1a). As a typical example, Cu/Fe/Zn-MOF-1 exhibits the morphology of irregular micron-scale polyhedrons (Figure 1b). Besides, elemental mapping images further confirm that the presence of uniformly dispersed Cu, Fe and Zn elements within the Cu/Fe/

Figure 1. (a) PXRD patterns of Cu/Fe/Zn-MOF-x (x = 0.5, 1 and 2); (b) SEM image of Cu/Fe/Zn-MOF-1; (c) Elemental mapping images of Cu/Fe/Zn-MOF-1.

Zn-MOF-1 (Figure 1c). A series of Cu/Fe $_3$ C/N—C-x-T electrocatalysts were then produced by annealing the corresponding Cu/Fe/Zn-MOF-x precursors at different temperatures (T), wherein the best ORR performance was achieved with Cu/Fe $_3$ C/N—C-1-1000 (vide infra).

SEM image indicates that Cu/Fe<sub>3</sub>C/N-C-1-1000 is composed of large CNTs (carbon nanotubes) and irregular carbon grains (Figure 2a). Interestingly, the morphologies of Cu/Fe<sub>3</sub>C/N–C-x-1000 materials are dependent on the Cu/Fe molar ratio (x). Compared to  $Cu/Fe_3C/N-C-1-1000$  with x=1, the carbon grain morphology predominates at x = 0.5 accompanied with a small number of tiny CNTs (Figure 2b), whilst only carbon grain morphology is observed at x = 2 (Figure 2c). Furthermore, no CNTs are observed in Cu/N-C-1000 and Fe<sub>3</sub>C/N-C-1000 in comparison to Cu/Fe<sub>3</sub>C/N-C-1-1000 (Figure S2), inferring the formation of CNTs might be synergistically resulted by Fe and Cu heteroatoms. With reference to Cu/N-C-1000 and Fe<sub>3</sub>C/N-C-1000, PXRD spectra of  $Cu/Fe_3C/N-C-x-1000$  (x = 0.5, 1 and 2) all demonstrate the existence of Fe<sub>3</sub>C and Cu peaks alongside with the carbon diffraction signals (Figure S3). Raman spectra of Cu/ Fe<sub>3</sub>C/N-C-x-1000 depict the common D and G bands at 1343 cm<sup>-1</sup> and 1585 cm<sup>-1</sup>, respectively (Figure S4). Out of them, Cu/Fe<sub>3</sub>C/N-C-1-1000 demonstrates the largest  $I_D/I_G$  ratio (0.98), suggesting more structural defects. TEM picture further discloses that both the bamboo-like CNTs (lattice fringe of 0.34 nm) and carbon grains are decorated by Fe<sub>3</sub>C crystallites (lattice fringe of 0.207 nm) (Figure 2d-2f). Although PXRD spectra of Cu/Fe<sub>3</sub>C/N-C-1-1000 show the existence of metallic Cu crystallites, no Cu nanoparticles can be found by TEM, inferring Cu nanoparticles in Cu/Fe<sub>3</sub>C/N-C-1-1000 might be either too small or deeply-buried into the carbon matrix. By comparison, TEM images of Cu/N-C-1000 and Fe<sub>3</sub>C/N-C-1000 clearly show the

presence of Cu NPs and Fe<sub>3</sub>C NPs dispersed within the carbon matrix (Figure S5). The above TEM characterizations suggest that Cu and Fe heteroatoms in the initial MOF precursor have strong mutual influence during the high-temperature pyrolysis. Finally, in order to further confirm the existence of Cu and Fe elements in Cu/Fe<sub>3</sub>C/N–C-1-1000, elemental mapping measurement was performed which proves the successful integration of Cu and Fe elements into the carbon matrix (Figure S6).

Cu/Fe<sub>3</sub>C/N-C-x-1000 materials show an approximate type I isotherm featuring a drastic adsorption at low pressure followed by a plateau, indicating the abundance of micropores (Figure 3a). Pore size distribution analyses further confirm that micropores (<2 nm) predominate in Cu/Fe<sub>3</sub>C/N-C-x-1000 (Figure 3b), with the surface area nearly contributed by micropores (Table S1). Among them, Cu/Fe<sub>3</sub>C/N-C-1-1000 displays the largest BET surface area (819.7 m<sup>2</sup>/g) and pore volume (0.39 cm<sup>3</sup>/g) (Table S1). XPS is a powerful tool to acquire the information on the composition and chemical bonding of surface elements. With reference to Cu/N-C-1000 and Fe<sub>3</sub>C/ N-C-1000, XPS survey spectra of Cu/Fe<sub>3</sub>C/N-C-1-1000 shows the presence of C, N, O, Fe and Cu elements, wherein the atomic percentage of Fe (0.07 at %) and Cu (0.05 at %) is close (Figure 3c and Figure S7). Similar to Cu/N-C-1000 and Fe<sub>3</sub>C/ N-C-1000, resolution of high-resolution N1s XPS spectra of Cu/ Fe<sub>3</sub>C/N-C-1-1000 shows the occurrence of pyridinic-N atom (398.4 eV), pyrrolic-N atom (400.3 eV), graphitic-N atom (401.2 eV), and oxidized N atom (402.7 eV) (Figure 3d and Figure S8). Besides, high-resolution Cu 2p and Fe 2p XPS spectra of Cu/Fe<sub>3</sub>C/N-C-1-1000 were further resolved and compared with Cu/N-C-1000 and Fe<sub>3</sub>C/N-C-1-1000 (Figure S9). With respect to Cu/N-C-1000 and Fe<sub>3</sub>C/N-C-1-1000, the high-resolution Cu2p XPS spectra show the existence of Cu<sup>0</sup> and Cu<sup>2+</sup>

species,<sup>[41]</sup> and the Fe 2p XPS spectra indicates the Fe elements exist in  $Fe^{2+}$  and  $Fe^{3+}$  chemical states.<sup>[52]</sup> Particularly, the binding energy (BE) of Cu 2p of Cu/Fe<sub>3</sub>C/N—C-1-1000 is negatively shifted with reference to Cu/N—C-1000. By contrast, the BE of Fe 2p of Cu/Fe<sub>3</sub>C/N—C-1-1000 shows a positive shift against Fe<sub>3</sub>C/N—C-1000. The opposite shift in the BE of Cu 2p and Fe 2p in Cu/Fe<sub>3</sub>C/N—C-1-1000 suggests the existence of electronic interactions between Cu and Fe heteroatoms.

## 2.2. Electrochemical Oxygen Reduction

The electrochemical oxygen reduction was examined by the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) technique in  $O_2$ -saturated 0.1 M KOH solution. As shown in Figure 4a and **Figure S10**, both the Cu/Fe molar ratio and pyrolysis temperature greatly influence the catalytic performance of Cu/Fe<sub>3</sub>C/N—C-x-1000 (x = 0.5, 1 and 2). The best result was obtained with Cu/Fe<sub>3</sub>C/N—C-1-1000, showing  $E_{\rm onset}$  of 0.95 V (vs. RHE) and  $E_{\rm 1/2}$  of 0.85 V (vs. RHE) that are comparable to the commercial Pt/C catalyst ( $E_{\rm onset}$  = 0.99 V,  $E_{\rm 1/2}$  = 0.85 V vs. RHE) and analogous catalysts in literatures (Table S2). Besides, the current density (2.6 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>) at 0.84 V delivered by Cu/Fe<sub>3</sub>C/N—C-1-1000 in alkaline solution is identical with Pt/C catalyst. However, the ORR performance of Cu/Fe<sub>3</sub>C/

N-C-1-1000 in the acidic electrolyte (0.1 M HClO<sub>4</sub>) is much poorer than the reference Pt/C (Figure S11), which might be ascribed to the instability of Fe<sub>3</sub>C under the acidic condition. Furthermore, RRDE (Rotating Ring Disk Electrode) tests reveal that the oxygen reduction reaction over Cu/Fe<sub>3</sub>C/N-C-1-1000 proceeds through an approximate four-electron route (n =  $3.80 \sim 3.94 @0.2-0.9 \text{ V}$ ) with a lower  $H_2O_2$  production (< 10%) (Figure 4b), which is close to the reference Pt/C catalyst. Finally, the CV response of Cu/Fe<sub>3</sub>C/N-C-1-1000 is barely affected upon addition of methanol in the alkaline solution, suggesting an excellent methanol tolerance (Figure S12). Standard ADT (accelerated duration test) demonstrates that E<sub>1/2</sub> of Cu/Fe<sub>3</sub>C/N-C-1-1000 decays slightly by 8 mV after 10,000 cycles (Figure 4c), highlighting the long-term stability of Cu/Fe<sub>3</sub>C/N—C-1-1000. The CV curve after 10,000 cycles exhibits a slight negative shift in oxygen reduction peak (from 0.81 V to 0.80 V (vs. RHE)) compared to the fresh sample (Figure S12 and Figure S13a). RRDE tests after 10,000 cycles show an small increase in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> yield (<20%) concurrent with the slightly decreasing electron transfer number ( $n = 3.65 \sim 3.98 @0.2-0.9 V$ ) (Figure S13b). The outstanding durability of Cu/Fe<sub>3</sub>C/N-C-1000 is also supported by chronoamperometry showing that Cu/Fe<sub>3</sub>C/N-C-1-1000 can retain 90% of current density after 20000 s, which outperforms the 79% retention of Pt/C (Figure S14).

potential of real application with Cu/Fe<sub>3</sub>C/N-C-1-1000, air cathode composed of Cu/Fe<sub>3</sub>C/N-C-1-1000 was tested in a home-made ZAB (Zinc-air battery), which delivers an OCV (Open Circuit Voltage) of 1.48 V larger than the Pt/C catalyst (1.41 V). Meanwhile, a maximal power density of 90 mW cm<sup>-2</sup> @114.9 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> was achieved by Cu/Fe<sub>2</sub>C/N—C-1-1000 which also surpasses the benchmark Pt/C catalyst (70 mW cm<sup>-2</sup>@115.9 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>) (Figure 4d). Particularly, only a minor decay of 2.1% in the output voltage of ZAB is resulted after continuous operation at 20 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> for 40 hrs (Figure S15).

As well demonstrated in literatures, the ORR performance of carbon-based electrocatalysts is essentially a collective result of multiple factors. On the basis of the aforementioned discussion, the best ORR performance with Cu/Fe<sub>3</sub>C/N–C-1-1000 achieved at the Cu/Fe molar ratio of 1 might be interpreted by these facts. Cu/Fe<sub>3</sub>C/N–C-1-1000 shows the predominance of large CNTs, which would be beneficial for electron transfer to accelerate ORR. Besides, Raman spectra of Cu/Fe<sub>3</sub>C/N–C-1-1000 suggest more defects compared to Cu/Fe<sub>3</sub>C/N–C-0.5-1000 and Cu/Fe<sub>3</sub>C/N–C-2-1000, which would provide more active sites to boost oxygen reduction. Furthermore, N<sub>2</sub> desorption-desorption experiments indicate that Cu/Fe<sub>3</sub>C/N–C-1-1000 exhibits the

largest BET surface area and pore volume among Cu/Fe<sub>3</sub>C/N–C-x-1000 (x=0.5, 1 and 2) (Table S1 and Figure S16), which would expose more active sites accessible to the reactants or intermediates. We also compare the ORR performance of Cu/Fe<sub>3</sub>C/N–C-1-1000 with Cu/N–C-1000 and Fe<sub>3</sub>C/N–C-1000 (Figure S17). It can be clearly seen that the ORR activities of Cu/Fe<sub>3</sub>C/N–C-1-1000 and Fe<sub>3</sub>C/N–C-1000 exceed Cu/N–C-1000, which could be ascribed to the higher activity of Fe-based active sites (e.g. Fe<sub>3</sub>C and Fe–N<sub>x</sub>). Nonetheless, Cu/Fe<sub>3</sub>C/N–C-1-1000 exhibits comparable ORR activity to Fe<sub>3</sub>C/N–C-1-1000, which again underlines that the ORR performance of carbon electrocatalysts is simultaneously governed by many factors considering the distinct active sites, catalyst morphology, surface area and porosity between Cu/Fe<sub>3</sub>C/N–C-1-1000 and Fe<sub>3</sub>C/N–C-1000.

#### 3. Conclusions

A class of Cu, Fe-decorated porous carbon electrocatalysts (Cu/Fe<sub>3</sub>C/N–C-x-T) has been made by pyrolysis of trimetallic Cu/Fe/Zn MOF precursors with varying Cu/Fe molar ratio. It demonstrates that the Cu/Fe molar ratio has a profound impact on the

morphology and the ORR performance of the resultant Cu/Fe<sub>3</sub>C/N–C-x-T catalysts. The best Cu/Fe<sub>3</sub>C/N–C-1-1000 electrocatalyst toward oxygen reduction was produced by pyrolysis at 1000 °C with the Cu/Fe molar ratio of 1, demonstrating a comparable ORR activity to the benchmark Pt/C catalyst in the alkaline solution but with a good methanol tolerance and electrochemical stability. The current work adds another nice example demonstrating the influence of the Cu heteroatom in the case of co-doping Fe and Cu heteroatoms into the carbon matrix.

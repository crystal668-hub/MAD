Plasmonic Ag nanoparticles have strong spectral absorption in the ultraviolet and visible light bands due to unique localized surface plasmon resonance effects. Meanwhile, nitrogen-doped graphene (NG) incorporates nitrogen (N) atoms into graphene skeleton through a hydrothermal process, thereby providing active oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) sites. Herein, plasmonic Ag nanoparticles decorated N-doped graphene (Ag/NG) is synthesized and utilized as ORR catalysts. The ORR performance of Ag/NG greatly exceeds that of pure NG. Its half-wave potential (0.86 V) exceeds that of commercial Pt/C (0.83 V). Under the AM 1.5G simulated sunlight, Ag/NG demonstrates photo-enhanced electrocatalytic performance with right shifting of onset potential and half-wave potential. In this case, the half-wave potential increases by 10 mV, and the current density also rises significantly. Therefore, the Ag/NG composite provides a potential strategy for the development of solar-enhanced electrocatalysts for fuel cells and metal-air batteries.

## **Introduction**

Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is a crucial cathodic reaction for fuel cells. Due to its sluggish kinetics, various ORR electrocatalysts have been designed and extensively investigated. Traditionally, Pt-based materials serve as efficient ORR catalysts. However, low abundance, high cost and poor durability of Pt have compelled people to explore other materials. For example, Ag is widely explored as an electrocatalyst due to its relatively abundant reserves and low-cost, but it has poor ORR activity in comparison with Pt. According to the Sabatier principle, the adsorption of oxygen on Ag is too weak to increase the ORR (1). Therefore, Ag is not the first choice for ORR catalysts. However, Ag nanoparticles (NPs) with strong light absorption characteristics in the ultraviolet and visible light bands can be used as light absorption antennas for other catalysts (2). Under visible light irradiation, Ag nanoparticles exhibit surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect and generate many hot electrons through blue channel damping (3). The potential of surface-activated ORR of Ag is relatively large. The enhanced electrochemical behavior of plasmonic nanostructures under illumination has been examined through both theoretical modeling and experimental investigations. Local surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effects on electrocatalysis has been valued and studied (4). When the frequency of incident photons matches the overall vibration frequency of electrons conducted by

noble metal nanoparticles, LSPR occurs as Ag nanoparticles strongly absorb photon energy (5). LSPR effects include photo-excited thermoelectronic, electric field enhancement, and photothermal conversion effects. For example, hydrogen evoluation reaction (HER) or OER performance of Au nanorods on 2-D MOF or Ni (OH)<sup>2</sup> nanosheets achieved photoenhanced electrocatalysis under a suitable laser (6, 7). ORR performance of Ag NPs supported on graphene demonstrated morphology-dependent responses on the same laser irradiation (1). Since the frequency of laser is rather specific and the energy is large, these laser-enhanced photoelectrocatalysts need to be modified for the practical use of sunlight (8, 9).

Generally, doping non-metal elements (N, P, S) into crystal lattice of graphene results in improved electrocatalysis (10). For example, N doped graphene (NG) with little lattice mismatch demonstrated newly functional activity (11). Since N is one of the elements adjacent to carbon in the periodic table, NG was simply synthesized with high specific surface area and good electrical conductivity (12). Herein, NG with high carrier mobility and large surface area was utilized as a 2-D carrier for plasmonic Ag nanoparticles. An excellent ORR catalyst was obtained by supporting Ag nanoparticles on NG, named Ag-NG. Prepared Ag nanoparticles were uniformly distributed on NG, electrons were transferred from Ag to NG, and the ORR performance of Ag-NG greatly exceeded that of pure Ag nanoparticles and NG. Half-wave potential (*E*1/2) can reach 0.86 V, far exceeding that of commercial Pt/C catalysts. Interestingly, Ag/NG showed lightenhanced electrocatalytic performance under AM 1.5G simulated sunlight, and the initial potential and *E*1/2 are right shifted under light irradiation.

## **Experimental Section**

#### Chemical Reagents and Materials

Oleic acid (90%), oleylamine (80-90%), 1, 2-tetradecanediol (90%), and silver acetate were bought from Sigma-Aldrich. Toluene, absolute ethyl alcohol and melamine were bought from Sinopharm Medicine Holding Group Co., Ltd.

#### Synthesis of Ag Nanoparticles

The preparation method of Ag nanoparticles was adapted from previous study (13). Oleic acid (0.5 mL), oleyamine (0.5 mL), and 1-dodecanol (5 mL) were mixed and heated to 220 °C. When the color of the mixed solution turned to brown, dispersed silver acetate (50 mg) in the solution with vigorous stirring and kept at this temperature for 1 h. After filtered and washed several times with n-hexane and ethanol, Ag nanoparticles were obtained.

#### Synthesis of NG

GO (100 mg) was dispersed in deionized water (100 mL) by sonication for 5 h to obtain a uniformly dispersed solution. Then a certain amount of melamine was dissolved in deionized water, and it was slowly put into the GO dispersion and sonicated for 1 h, and the solution was stirred at 90 °C for 2 h. Then, the mixed solution was directly put into a Teflon reactor for hydrothermal reaction at 180 C for 12 h. The hydrothermal product was collected by freeze-drying under vacuum for 48 h. Finally, the powder was prepared by heat-treating at 800 °C for 4 h at a heating rate of 3 °C min-1 under Ar gas.

## Fabrication of Ag-NG

Ag nanoparticles (10 mg) were dispersed in n-hexane (1 mL) to obtain a stable suspension. Then, 20 mg of N-doped graphene and the suspension were added into a mixture of toluene (15 mL) and ethanol (5 mL) with stirring. The final product was centrifuged several times with ethanol after 1 h ultrasonic treatment and 8 h stirring, and then dried in a vacuum drying oven for 6 h. The product obtained was nominated for Ag/NG nanocomposites. The prepared material was named according to the amount of silver nanoparticles loaded, in which silver nanoparticles were 5 mg, 10 mg, and 20 mg corresponding to samples Ag-NG1, Ag-NG2, and Ag-NG3.

## Electrochemical Measurements

Electrochemical sample preparation and testing were performed in a standard threeelectrode configuration on the CHI760E electrochemical workstation, which were described in our previous study (14). 4 mg sample was dispersed in the solution composed of 200 μL deionized water, 50 μL isopropanol and 30 uL Nafion (5 wt. %). After ultrasonic treatment, 2.3 μL of catalyst ink was dropped onto 3 mm glassy carbon (GC) electrode. The catalyst loading on the disc was 0.4 mg cm-2. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and linear sweeping voltammetry (LSV) curves were investigated in N2 or O2 saturated 0.1 M KOH solution.

#### **Results and Discussion**

Silver nanoparticles prepared in the oil phase are loaded onto NG by van der Waals force in a mixed solution of toluene and ethanol. As shown in Figure 1a-b, the size of Ag nanoparticles is mainly around 10 to 11 nm. Figure 1c displays the 2-D wrinkle characteristic of NG. Figure 1d indicates that Ag nanoparticles are uniformly distributed on NG. Besides, there is no obvious change on Ag nanoparticles before and after loading onto NG. High angle annual dark field-scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) and x-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mapping were performed to confirm the distribution of Ag, N and C in Figure 1e. N element is evenly distributed on the carbon material, and Ag is also relatively uniform on the surface, indicating the successful doping of N and loading of Ag nanoparticles. Due to protective effect of NG, Ag nanoparticles can maintain stable during the ORR process (15).

Figure 2. XRD patterns of NG and Ag-NG.

As shown in Figure 2, there are characteristic peaks of graphitic structure around 26° for NG and Ag-NG. As for Ag-NG, there are several obvious characteristic peaks of Ag around 38.2°, 44.4°, 64.6° and 77.6°, assigned to the (111), (200), (220) and (311) planes of Ag, respectively. It proves that Ag nanoparticles are stably supported on NG, which corresponds to the TEM analysis results above.

XPS analyses were carried out to examine chemical compositions and bonding configurations of samples. Figure 3a shows the survey spectra of NG and Ag-NG, indicating the presence of N and Ag in the carbon materials. C 1s (Figure 3b and 3e) can be deconvoluted into C-C (284.6 eV), C-N (285.2 eV), C-O (286.2eV), and C=C (288.4eV) configurations (16). The C element mainly exists in the form of C-C bond and C-N bond in both two figures. The content of each bond is calculated based on the area of each peak in the XPS spectrum. The content of C-C bond in NG (45.5%) is higher than that of Ag-NG (43.8%), while the content of C-N bonds is the opposite. The content of C-N bond in Ag-NG (34.1%) is much higher than that of NG (29.0%). N 1s spectrum of NG can be deconvoluted into three peaks (Figure 3c) centered at 398.2 eV, 400.8 eV and 402.1 eV, attributing to pyridinic N, pyrrolic N, and graphitic N respectively (17). The contents of pyrrolic N and graphitic N are relatively larger. The graphitic N is very beneficial for the ORR performance of the material. Ag 3d spectrum is deconvoluted into Ag 3d5/2 (368.4 eV) and Ag 3d3/2 (374.3 eV) (18). The ratio of the two contents is close to 1:2, indicating that Ag nanoparticles mainly exist in the form of elemental Ag. The Ag peak position exhibited by the XPS test is smaller than the theoretical value, indicating electron transfer from Ag to NG.

To test the ORR performance of different samples, cyclic voltammetry (CV) and linear sweep voltammetry (LSVs) were performed in N2 or O2-saturated alkaline electrolyte (0.1 M KOH) using a rotating disk electrode (RDE). Figure 4a shows CVs of Ag-NG nanocomposites in N2 or O2 saturated solution. Figure 4b shows the LSV curves of the materials at 1600 rpm under O2 saturation. The NG loaded with 10 mg Ag nanoparticles has the best ORR performance. The *E*1/2 of Ag-NG2 (0.86 V) is higher than that of commercial Pt/C (0.83 V). The *E*1/2 of Ag-NG1 with less Ag content is greatly reduced, proving that Ag can enhance the ORR performance of NG. Although the LSV curve of Ag-NG3 loaded with a larger amount of Ag has a relatively positive initial potential, the *E*1/2 is much smaller than those of other samples. This may be because excessive Ag content causing partial oxidation of reduction reaction causes obstruction. Figure 4c is the ORR polarization curves of Ag-NG at different rotation rates. From the

linear K-L plots (inset), it refers to the first order reaction kinetics from 0.4 V to 0.65 V. The numbers (*n*) of electrons transferred for ORR on Ag-NG are calculated by using the Koutechy-Levich (K-L) equation to be 3.5. It suggests a major 4e transfer process for Ag-NG. Figure 4d shows that the ORR polarization curve of Ag-NG right-shifts under light. Its *E*1/2 increases from 0.86 V to 0.87 V, and the current density also increases significantly. The comparison sample did not show the phenomenon of photo-enhanced electrocatalysis except that current density of NG has a slight change. Due to its LSPR effect, Ag nanoparticles in Ag-NG convert the energy of light into electrocatalytic boost and enhance the performance of the materials. Under simulated sunlight, Ag-NG exhibits enhanced ORR catalytic activity.

Tafel slopes provide further evidence that the addition of silver promotes the performance of the material. It can be seen from Figure 5a that Ag-NG's Tafel slope (131.4 mV dec<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> ) is significantly smaller than that of NG (198.1 mV dec<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> ), indicating that the addition of silver significantly promotes ORR kinetics. Among them, Tafel slopes of Ag-NG under light conditions (121.8 mV dec<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> ) is lower than that under dark conditions (131.4 mV dec<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> ), which proves that the LSPR effect of silver can enhance the performance of the material under simulated sunlight conditions. These results can be further supported by transient photocurrent measurements as shown in Figure 5b. When the light is on and off, Ag-NG shows a quite stable steady state photocurrent at each switching cycle of the light. In contrast, NG shows tiny photocurrent, which may be due to the photothermal effect leading to accelerated electron transfer. However, due to low light intensity and short light time, this tiny photocurrent does not show obvious changes on the LSV curve and can be ignored. The chronoamperometric response of Ag-NG to methanol exchange was performed by injecting 5.0 mL methanol into 80 mL 0.1 M KOH saturated with O2. As shown in Figure 5c, there is no distinct change in the current of Ag-NG after injecting methanol (t=400 s), while the cathode current loss of the Pt/C catalyst is obvious. This shows that Ag-NG has excellent methanol tolerance without methanol poisoning. In addition, the electrochemical durability of Ag-NG and Pt/C catalysts was studied by the chronoamperometric test of current versus time (I-t) at 1600 rpm. As shown in Figure 5d, after 14000s under the same conditions, the current retention rate of Ag-NG is 91.32%, while the current retention rate of Pt/C is only 62.65%. Therefore, the durability of Ag-NG is better than that of Pt/C catalyst.

### **Conclusion**

In summary, plasmonic Ag nanoparticles decorated N-doped graphene (Ag/NG) were synthesized and utilized as ORR catalysts. The ORR performance of Ag/NG greatly exceeded that of pure NG. Its *E*1/2 potential was 0.86 V, exceeding that of commercial Pt/C (0.83 V). Under the AM 1.5G simulated sunlight, Ag/NG demonstrated photoenhanced electrocatalytic performance with right shifting of onset potential and halfwave potential. The *E*1/2 increased by 10 mV, while the current density also rose significantly. Therefore, the Ag/NG composite provides a potential strategy for the development of solar-enhanced electrocatalysts for fuel cells and metal-air batteries.

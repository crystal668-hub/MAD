#### **Abstract**

The slow kinetic of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) hampers the practical application of energy conversion devices, such as fuel cells, metal-air batteries. Here, an efficient ORR electrocatalyst consists of Co, Ni co-decorated nitrogen-doped double shell hollow carbon cage (Ni–Co@NHC) was fabricated by pyrolyzing Ni-doped polydopamine wrapped ZIF-67. During the preparation, polydopamine served as a protective layer can effectively prevent the aggregation of Co and Ni nanoparticles during the pyrolysis process, and at the same time forming a carbon layer to grow a double layer carbon cage. This unique hollow structure endows the catalyst with a high specific surface area as well as more exposed active sites. Also benefited from the synergistic effect between Ni and Co nanoparticles, the Ni–Co@NHC catalyst leads to an outstanding ORR performance of half-wave potential ( $E_{1/2}$ , 0.862 V), outperforms that of commercial Pt/C catalyst. Additionally, when Ni–Co@NHC was used in the cathode for the zinc-air battery, the cell exhibits high power density (108 mW cm<sup>-2</sup>) and high specific capacity (806 mAh g<sup>-1</sup>) at 20 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> outperforming Pt/C. This work offers a promising design strategy for the development of high-performance ORR electrocatalysts.

#### 1. Introduction

Electrochemical storage and electrochemical conversion is a key technology for developing a clean energy economy, which has attracted the world's attention [1–4]. Due to their intrinsic safety and high theoretical specific energy density, the zinc-air batteries were considered one of the best choices. However, the sluggish kinetics of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) hinder the commercialization of zinc-air batteries [5–7]. As is well known, Pt-based catalysts as the most

efficient catalysts for ORR reaction was obstructed widespread application by the high cost and scarcity of reserves. So that, it is inevitable to develop high-efficiency and lowcost ORR catalysts [8–11].

Recently, transition metals (such as Fe, Co, Ni, etc) supported on N-doped carbon (TM@NC) have been regarded as the most promising electrocatalysts due to their high electrocatalytic activity [12]. One of the conventional synthetic method for TM@NC is using the metal organic frameworks (MOFs, such as ZIF-67, ZIF-8, MIL-125) as the suitable sacrificial template to pyrolysis. Particularly, zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) constructed by metal ions

coordinated with imidazole ligands, are promising alternatives by virtue of their richness of nitrogen, carbon, and metal ions, regular polyhedral morphology, and zeolite-analogous pores. ZIF-derived porous carbon catalysts not only have uniform active sites, but also have large specific surface area. It has been reported that the TM@NC materials derived from ZIF can achieve outstanding ORR catalytic performance [13-16]. However, ZIFs are prone to structure collapse and metal aggregation during directly high temperature pyrolysis process, which reduced the activity of electrocatalysts. To regard this, surface modification is a feasible strategy to prevent this phenomenon [17]. Due to the high adhesion ability, high nitrogen content, and self-polymerization of dopamine (DA), it can quickly wrap around substrates of various sizes, shapes, and structures after pyrolysis. Pyrolyze ZIFs after wrapping DA can be obtained a novel double-layer stable N-doped carbon shell structure. The multilayer structure could expose more active sites due to the larger specific surface area and accelerate mass and charge transfer. What's more, synergistic effects originating from N-doped carbon and doped with other transition metals will significance improve electrocatalyst performance [18-20]. Besides, compared with single metal catalysts, bimetallic catalysts are also considered to be a more powerful approach to promote catalytic performance by changing intrinsic properties of pristine materials [21].

In the present study, a porous composite consists of Ni and Co nanoparticles co-decorated on N doped double shell hollow carbon cage (Ni-Co@NHC) was fabricated by pyrolysis of DA coated ZIF-67. The double shell structure reduces the diffusion distance of the reactants to the active substance, provides a large specific surface area made the active site distribution more uniform. The experiment result confirms that the strong synergetic effect between Co and Ni enhances the ORR performance of Ni-Co@NHC than Pt/C, as well as superior stability in alkaline medium (half potential only changed 4 mV after 5000 cycles). In addition, zinc-air battery packaged using Ni-Co@NHC as air electrode demonstrated a better power density (108 mW cm<sup>-2</sup>) and specific capacity (806 mAh g<sup>-1</sup>) at a current density of 20 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, showing a promising potential application in energy conversion devices.

crystallization for 24 h, centrifuge, and wash the mixture with methanol, then dried at 60 °C to give the final product [22].

#### 2.3. Synthesis of Ni-Co@NHC

Dissolve 100 mg ZIF-67 in 10 ml methanol. Then, at room temperature, 10 ml methanol containing 30 mg DA was quickly added to the dispersion of ZIF-67. Stirring the solution for 10 min to obtain ZIF-67@PDA, then add 20 ml methanol solution containing 40 mg Ni(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, and stirring the mixture for 12 h. Centrifuged and washed with methanol, then dried at 60 °C. The dried sample was heated to 700 °C at the speed of 2 °C min<sup>-1</sup> and keep for 5 h in Ar purge tube furnace. The resulting product was referred to as Ni–Co@NHC. For comparison purposes, ZIF-67 and ZIF-67@PDA were heated to 700 °C and then keen for 5 h in Ar purge tube furnace to prepare Co–N/C and Co@NHC, respectively.

#### 2.4. Materials characterizations

The morphology and structure of the composite was investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi S-4800) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Jeol-Jem-2800). The crystal structure of the as-prepared samples was characterized by x-ray powder diffraction (XRD, D8 Discover, Bruker, Germany) at a scanning rate of 6° min<sup>-1</sup>. Raman spectra were obtained using the in Via Reflex Raman imaging microscope system [23]. The N<sub>2</sub> adsorption/desorption analysis was conducted using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller method on a V-Sorb 2800P instrument. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo Fisher Scientific, ESCALAB 250Xi, America) was applied to study the chemical state of the samples.

#### 2.5. Electrochemical test

All electrochemical tests were carried out in a three-electrode cell using CHI 760E electrochemical analyzer at room temperature. Platinum carbon electrodes coated with catalysts was used as the test systems. Carbon rod and Hg/HgO (saturated KCI) were used as counter electrode and reference electrodes, respectively. 0.1 M KOH saturated with N<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> was used as the electrolyte for the ORR. All electric potentials were counted with respect to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) according to the following equation

$$E_{\text{RHE}} = E_{\text{Hg/HgO}} + 0.0591 \times \text{pH} + 0.242.$$

Catalyst ink was made from 2mg catalyst and 3  $\mu$ l of Nafion (0.125 wt%) dissolved in methanol solution, 1mg Vulcan XC-72 1000  $\mu$ l of isopropyl alcohol in an ultrasonic bath for 30 min. Then, 30  $\mu$ l catalyst ink was coated onto the platinum carbon electrodes, which results in a loading of 0.46 mg cm<sup>-2</sup>. The scanning range of the ORR system was 0.1 –1.1 V (V versus RHE). The rotation rate was 1600 rpm, and the scanning rate was 10 mV s<sup>-1</sup>.

The number of electrons transferred (n) at different electrode potentials was determined by the following Koutecky–Levich

(K-L) equation:

$$\frac{1}{j} = \frac{1}{j_K} + \frac{1}{j_L} = \frac{1}{B\omega^{0.5}} + \frac{1}{j_K},$$

$$B = 0.2 \, nFC_0 (D_0)^{2/3} v^{-1/6},$$

where  $j_K$  and  $j_L$  are the dynamic currents and diffusion-limited respectively;  $\omega$  is the speed of rotation; F is Faraday constant (96 485 C mol<sup>-1</sup>); n is the number of electron transfers;  $D_0$  is the diffusion coefficient of  $O_2$  in 0.1 M KOH, (1.9  $\times$  10<sup>-5</sup> cm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>);  $C_0$  is concentration in volume (1.2  $\times$  10<sup>-3</sup> mol l<sup>-1</sup>); and v is the dynamic viscosity (0.01 cm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>).

In addition, reaction kinetics were assessed by Tafel equations and Tafel diagrams:

$$\eta = b \log \left( \frac{j}{j_0} \right),$$

where  $\eta$  is the overpotential, the unit is mV; b is Tafel slope, the unit is mV dec<sup>-1</sup>; j is current density, the unit is mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, and  $j_0$  is the exchange current density.

### 2.6. Zinc-air battery test

The zinc-air batteries were fabricated using a home-made plastic cell. Then, the catalysts ink was sprayed onto carbon fiber paper substrate (1.5  $\times$  1.5 cm) to form the air electrode. The loading amount is around 1.0 mg cm $^{-2}$ . A cleaned zinc foil was used as the anode. The electrolyte was a mixture of 6.0 M KOH. All characterizations were recorded using CS2350 electrochemical workstation. Galvanostatic discharge of zinc-air batteries was measured with the recurrent galvanostatic pulse, and the ampere density was 20 mA cm $^{-2}$ . At the room temperature, the discharge curves were recorded by LAND battery testing station (CT2001A). Polarization information was obtained to use the galvanic dynamic means at the scan speed in 50 mV s $^{-1}$ , the cut-off voltage for discharge curves is 0.1 V.

The specific capacity was calculated according to the equation:

Specific capacity (mAh g<sup>-1</sup>) = 
$$\frac{It}{m_{Zn}}$$
,

where, I represent the current,  $m_{\rm Zn}$  represents the weight of zinc consumed during the discharge process, and t represent the effective discharge hours.

The chemical equations for the anode and cathode are as follows:

$$\begin{split} \text{Anode: } Zn + 2OH^- &\leftrightarrow ZnO + H_2O + 2e^-, \\ \text{Cathode: } O_2 + 4e^- + 2H_2O &\leftrightarrow 4OH^-, \\ \text{Overall reaction: } 2Zn + O_2 &\leftrightarrow 2ZnO. \end{split}$$

#### 3. Results and discussion

The synthetic procedure of Ni-Co@NHC is portrayed in figure 1. Briefly, ZIF-67 was synthesized by coordination of Co<sup>2+</sup> with 2-methylimidazole. Then, Ni-doped DA added into methanol solution containing ZIF-67 under room temperature to obtain DA wrapped ZIF-67. After that, the typical double-shell hollow nanostructure Ni-Co@NHC particles was obtained after carbonization under 700 °C with Ar atmosphere. The introduction of DA prevents the aggregation of metal nanoparticles during high temperature pyrolysis and improves the stability of the ORR [24]. The active Ni-Co binary metals can provide strong electronic coupling [25]. That is, there exists synergistic effect in Ni-Co metals, which can induce changes in surface properties and intrinsic polarity shifts during the oxygen reaction, thus optimizing the adsorption of oxygen intermediates and increasing the kinetics of the reaction [25–27]. Accordingly, Ni-Co@NHCs reveals remarkable catalytic performance in ORR.

Figures 2(a) and (b) show the scanning electron microscope (SEM) image of Ni-Co@NHC. It is clearly obvious that the samples have a wrinkled in the surface but still maintain the dodecahedral morphology. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) images further show that after pyrolysis, Ni-Co@NHC formation a double layer carbon cage structure consisted of external PDA case and internal ZIF-67 core (figure 2(c)). Figure S1 (available online at stacks.iop. org/NANO/33/065409/mmedia) shows the SEM image of the sample derived from the direct pyrolysis of Ni-doped ZIF-67 without dopamine addition (named as Ni–Co–N/C). It can be clearly seen that the Ni-Co-N/C exhibits obvious structural collapse compared with Ni-Co@NHC which inherits the structural integrity. This indicates that the outer layer of PDA effectively prevented the collapse of the structure during pyrolysis. The in-depth crystalline feature of the as-obtained Ni-Co@NHC was further characterized by HRTEM. As exhibited in figures 2(d) and (e), the 0.204 nm lattice stripe spaces correspond to the crystal plane of Co (111) or Ni (111). The elemental mapping shows homogeneous distributions of Co, Ni, O, N elements. And it further reveals that Co is mainly distributed in the inner layer and Ni is in the inner and outer layers of the N-doped carbon. (figures 2(f)-(k)) [28].

Figure 3(a) exhibits the XRD patterns of Co–N/C, Co@NHC and Ni–Co@NHC. Apart from the graphite carbon peak at 26.5°, the XRD patterns show diffraction maximum at 44°, 51° and 75° are assigned to (111), (200) and (220) of the metallic Ni and Co [29]. The C, N, O, Co and Ni of Ni–Co@NHC are emerged in the XPS survey (figure S2). Ni–

Co@NHC shows three major peaks in the C1s region, assigned to C-C (284.5eV), C = O (288.9 eV) and C-N (285.3 eV) (figure S3), respectively [30, 31]. The Ni 2p spectrum of Ni-Co@NHC (figure 3(b)) demonstrates the metallic nickel (853.9 eV due to  $2p_{3/2}$  and 870.9 eV due to  $2p_{1/2}$ ) and Ni–N (855.8 eV due to  $2p_{3/2}$  and 872.8 eV due to  $2p_{1/2}$ ), and the deconvoluted peaks located at 862 eV and 880 eV ascribed to Ni 2p satellite peaks. Co 2p spectra showing Co metal (778.9 eV) and Co-N (781.9 eV) (figure 3(c)) [32]. Clearly, the Co 2p peak of Ni-Co@NHC shifted towards a lower binding energy, about 0.18 eV, compared with Co@NHC. This negative drift indicated that the electron density of the Co atoms had been enhanced by the introduction of Ni atoms. Ni-N-C and Co-N-C can be used as active sites, favouring their property in ORR catalysis [31]. In figure 3(d), the N 1s spectrum of Co@NHC and Ni-Co@NHC can be divided into graphitic-N (401.3 eV), Co-N<sub>x</sub> (399.3 eV), pyrrolic-N (399.6 eV), and pyridinic-N (398.3 eV). Among them, table S1 exhibited the  $N_{(pyridinic\ +\ graphitic)}/N_{total}$  ratio for Ni–Co@NHC and Co@NHC are corresponding to 0.73 and 0.61, respectively. The presence of high levels of graphite-N and pyridine-N enhance the positive charge density on adjacent carbons, and the limiting current density is increased by effective O<sub>2</sub> adsorption [33, 34]. In addition, graphite-N and pyridine-N can increase ORR activity during ORR process by inducing a four-electron mechanism of O<sub>2</sub> reduction. Figure 3(e) displays the nitrogen sorption measurements and pore size distribution of Ni-Co@NHC composites. After carbonization, the sample exhibit type-II isotherms and an H4 hysteresis loopback, showing the Ni-Co@NHC is rich in microporous and mesoporous structure. The specific surface area of Ni-Co@NHC was

313 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>. The aperture distribution curve of Ni-Co@NHC showed a multi-peak distribution, which further confirmed the graded porous carbon structure of microporous (peak pore about 0-2 nm) and mesoporous (peak pore about 2-50 nm) of this sample. The large specific surface area will expose more active sites for Ni-Co@NHC nanocomposites to provide sufficient contact areas between electrocatalyst to electrolyte. Mesopores and macropores are thought to facilitate the entry and release of oxygen molecules into the active site, thus promoting the quality of transport [34]. Figure 3(f) shows the Raman spectrum of Ni-Co@NHC. The peak of D and G band of the Ni-Co@NHC occurred at 1348 cm<sup>-1</sup> and 1587 cm<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. Their intensity ratio  $(I_D/I_G)$  is equal to 0.85 indicating improved crystallinity with low defects in the Ni-Co@NHC, and it has high-graphitization degree, which accounts for its high conductivity [35].

To investigate the activity of Ni-Co@NHC at room temperature, the CV was measured by saturating N<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> in 0.1 M KOH. As exhibited in figure S4, in the O2 saturated electrolyte a cathodic peak of 0.911 V appeared, whereas a quasi-rectangular voltammetry without any activity appeared in the N<sub>2</sub> saturated electrolyte, indicating a very good ORR electrocatalytic activity of Ni-Co@NHC [36]. The onset potential of Ni-Co@NHC is 0.963 V, and the half-wave potential is 0.862 V (figure 4(a)). The half-wave potential of Ni–Co@NHC is slightly higher than that of Pt/C  $(E_{1/2}, 0.851)$ V), suggesting its excellent ORR performance. Note that, the ORR activity of Ni-Co@NHC is also superior than many other catalysts reported in the literature (figure S5) [33, 37–43]. The excellent ORR performance for Ni–Co@NHC is due to N-doped nano-carbon, Co/Ni catalytic sites and the synergistic effect of Co/Ni. As shown in figure 4(b), dynamic activity using the K-L method displays that the ampere density of Ni-Co@NHC increases in proportion to the rotational velocity. The fitted K-L plots exhibited average

number of electron transfers of Ni-Co@NHC is 4, revealing a four-electron process of ORR (figure 4(c)) [44]. Figure 4(d) shows the Tafel slope for all samples. The Ni-Co@NHC gains the lowest Tafel slope of 38 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>, implying that Ni-Co@NHC has a faster ORR kinetics. The electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) of ZIF-derived electrocatalysts was estimated by measuring the double-layer capacitance  $(C_{\rm dl})$  [45]. As shown in figure S6, the  $C_{\rm dl}$  value of Ni-Co@NHC is 60 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>, higher than that of Co@NHC (47 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>) and Co-N/C (38 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>), indicating that Ni-Co@NHC has higher ECSA and more active sites, which is beneficial for the catalytic performance. For an excellent ORR catalyst, more attention should also be paid to its stability. Figure 4(e) illustrates that the  $E_{1/2}$  of Ni–Co@NHC has almost no attenuation, even after 5000 accelerated durability tests, suggesting the ORR stability is outstanding. In contrast, after 5000 cycles, the commercial Pt/C exhibits a distinct degradation of catalytic activity. Moreover, the i-t measurementsin 0.1 M KOH were used to further reveal the methanol resistance performance of Ni-Co@NHC. The current drop of Ni-Co@NHC is negligible after the addition of 3 M methanol. On the contrary, the current loss of Pt/C is significant (figure 4(f)). Therefore, Ni-Co@NHC is a very outstanding ORR catalyst with high catalytic performance, outstanding methanol resistance and stability.

The superior ORR electrocatalytic performances of Ni–Co@NHC encouraged us to assemble the primary zinc-air batteries for practical application, in which 6 M KOH as the electrolyte, the as-prepared catalyst spared on carbon paper as cathode and the zinc foil as anode (figure 5(a)). According to power density curves and discharge polarization in figure 5(b), the zinc-air batteries assembled by Ni–Co@NHC catalyst display the power density of 122 mW cm<sup>-2</sup>, which is better than 103 mW cm<sup>-2</sup> for the battery assembled by Pt/C and recently reported catalysts (table S2), indicating the superior ORR

performance of Ni–Co@NHC [46, 47]. As illustrated in figure 5(c), the open-circuit voltage for Ni–Co@NHC is 1.47 V, higher than Pt/C (1.45 V). The discharge curves in figure 5(d) demonstrate that the discharge potential decreased with increasing current density but returned to its initial value when the current density was decreased, indicating good rate performance. The discharge at 20 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> was tested until the Zn plate was broken through. As shown in figure S7, the Zn plate was empty in the center after discharge and the consumed mass of Zn is 0.4308g. The specific capacity of the zinc-air battery for Ni–Co@NHC is 805.0 mAh g<sup>-1</sup> performed at 20 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>

based on loss of quality of the zinc foil which superior to the Pt/C (745 mAh g<sup>-1</sup>) (figure 5(e)). In addition, the structure of Ni–Co@NHC has ignorable change after discharge, indicating the structural stability of Ni–Co@NHC benefiting from the double layer carbon cage design (figure s8). As an illustration, light-emitting diodes can be powered by two zinc-air batteries connected in series (figure 5(f)). The good stability and durability are attributed to the ordered micropore-mesopore structure which shortens the length of molecular/ion diffusion during ORR, increasing the accessibility of the active site and allowing complete exposure of the active site.

In this work, a Ni-Co@NHC composite electrocatalyst was prepared showing excellent ORR performance. Ni-Co@NHC has double layer carbon nanocage, which has the unique hollow structure to provide a large specific and exposes more active sites. Meanwhile, double layer carbon nanocage prevents the aggregation of Co and Ni nanoparticles and keeps an intact structure, benefiting its long-term stability performance. In addition, the synergy of Ni-Co also improves the ORR activity of Ni-Co@NHC. Attributed to these beneficial features, the Ni-Co@NHC catalysts displays an excellent  $E_{1/2}$  of 0.862 V that is better than commercial Pt/C.

This work demonstrated the unique structure of double layer carbon nanocage hollow nanostructure supported binary metal nanoparticles can be a promising design strategy for developing efficient ORR catalysts.

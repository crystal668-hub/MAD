**Controlled synthesis of highly efficient, stable, and cost-effective oxygen reaction electrocatalysts with atomically-dispersed Me–N***x***–C active sites through an effective strategy is highly desired for high-performance energy devices. Herein, based on regenerated silk fibroin dissolved in ferric chloride and zinc chloride aqueous solution, 2D porous carbon nanosheets with atomically-dispersed Fe–N***x***–C active sites and very large specific surface area (≈2105 m2 g<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> ) are prepared through a simple thermal treatment process. Owing to the 2D porous structure with large surface area and atomic dispersion of Fe–N***x***–C active sites, the as-prepared silk-derived carbon nanosheets show superior electrochemical activity toward the oxygen reduction reaction with a half-wave potential (***E***1/2) of 0.853 V, remarkable stability with only 11 mV loss in** *E***1/2 after 30 000 cycles, as well as good catalytic activity toward the oxygen evolution reaction. This work provides a practical and effective approach for the synthesis of high-performance oxygen reaction catalysts towards advanced energy materials.**

performance of metal–air batteries (such as energy efficiency, output power density, and stability) is still restricted by the kinetically sluggish oxygen reaction on the air-cathode, which puts forward urgent requirements for highly active and durable oxygen reaction catalysts.[3–5] To date, various catalysts with high activity, good durability, and low cost, such as metal-free heteroatom-doped carbon materials[6–12] and ternary Me–N*x*–C materials (Me = transition metals, N = nitrogen, C = carbon),[13,14] have been explored as potential alternatives of conventional noble metal based catalysts.

Ternary Me–N*x*–C materials, especially those with atomical dispersion of Me–N*x*–C sites, have been demonstrated to show superior catalytic performance to Pt/C, which can be ascribed to the Me–N*x*–C moieties-induced effective modification of the local electronic structure and the cor-

responding optimization of the intermediate adsorption.[15–19] To prepare highly active Me–N*x*–C materials, complicated structure design strategies for precursors are generally employed, such as polymer-encapsulated structure,[20] metal (hydr)oxides @polymer core–shell structure,[21] copolymer structure,[22] zeolitic imidazolate framework-encapsulated structure,[23] and polymerizable ionic liquid functionalized with nitrate groups.[24] Therefore, developing an effective and versatile strategy to controllably synthesize catalysts with atomically-dispersed Me–N*x*–C active sites would be of great significance and challenge.

Silk, as an abundant protein biomaterial, has been developed as a green and promising precursor to prepare intrinsically N-doped carbon materials through simple thermal treatment, which is attributed to the amino-group-rich chemical structure and the β-sheet structure of silk fibroin.[25–27] Owing to the intrinsic N-doping, silk-derived carbon materials have been investigated for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), which generally showed inferior ORR performance because of their low specific surface area and inadequate active sites.[28,29] Actually, natural silk fibroin can be dissolved in high-concentration transition metal salt solution, and then regenerated into 2D lamellar-like layer structure due to the self-assembly of hydrophobic and hydrophilic blocks of silk fibroin.[30] After a thermal annealing process at a temperature above the glass transition temperature, the regenerated silk fibroin would retain www.advancedsciencenews.com

the lamellar-like layer structure and possess a  $\beta$ -sheet crystal-dominant structure, which facilitates its further transformation into 2D carbon nanosheets. Besides, owing to the potential strong interaction between transition metal ions and amino groups, transition metal ions may be tightly anchored into the 2D regenerated silk fibroin precursor framework, providing potential for producing ternary Me–N $_x$ –C nanosheets with atomically-dispersed active sites.

The unique combination of intrinsic N-doping, dissolvability in transition metal salt solution, 2D lamellar regenerated structure, and potential anchor of transition metal species into regenerated silk framework, make silk fibroin a promising precursor for the preparation of 2D carbon materials with atomically-dispersed Me–N $_x$ –C. Herein, based on regenerated silk fibroin dissolved in ferric chloride (FeCl $_3$ ) and zinc chloride (ZnCl $_2$ ) aqueous solution, we prepared 2D porous carbon nanosheets with atomically-dispersed Fe–N $_x$ –C active sites and large specific surface area ( $\approx$ 2105 m $^2$  g $^{-1}$ ) through a simple pyrolysis process. The atomic dispersion of Fe–N $_x$ –C active sites throughout the 2D porous carbon nanosheets together with the large specific surface area endow the as-prepared silk-derived carbon nanosheets (Fe-SilkPNC) with highly efficient oxygen reaction catalytic activity. To be more specific,

the as-obtained Fe-SilkPNC showed superior electrochemical activity (half-wave potential ( $E_{1/2}$ ) of 0.853 V) toward ORR (as a contrast, commercial Pt/C with 20 wt% Pt loading showed a  $E_{1/2}$  of 0.834 V), remarkable stability with negligible loss in  $E_{1/2}$ , as well as good catalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Compared with other strategies by using rationally-designed precursors (such as polymerizable ionic liquids) to prepare ternary Me–N $_x$ –C nanosheets, [24] this work represents a new approach for the preparation of high-performance, stable, and cost-effective catalysts with atomically-dispersed Me–N $_x$ –C active sites towards the development of next-generation energy systems.

The preparation process of silk-derived 2D porous carbon nanosheets with atomically-dispersed Fe–N $_{\rm x}$ –C (Fe-SilkPNC) is illustrated in **Figure 1a**. Degummed silk fibers were first dissolved in FeCl $_{\rm 3}$ /ZnCl $_{\rm 2}$  solution at 100 °C, forming homogeneous silk fibroin solution. After being dried in air, regenerated silk fibroin with Fe and Zn ions was pyrolyzed to obtain the Fe-SilkPNC. More details for the preparation process can be found in the Experimental Section. The formation of the unique 2D Fe-SilkPNC can be interpreted from three synergistic aspects: (i) Due to the self-assembly of hydrophobic and hydrophilic blocks of silk fibroin, dissolved silk fibroin reconstructs into

2D lamellar structures, which can be further transformed into carbon nanosheets in the following pyrolysis process; (ii) Due to the strong interaction between Fe ions (Fe3<sup>+</sup>) and amino groups, Fe ions are tightly anchored onto the regenerated silk fibroin framework, facilitating the formation of atomically dispersed Fe–N*x* moieties in the 2D carbon skeleton and promoting the graphitization during pyrolysis; (iii) Zn ions act as activation agents to generate pores in the carbon nanosheets, leading to the formation of porous carbon nanosheets with large specific surface area. Thus, the as-formed porous 2D nanosheets, which have abundant exposed Fe–N*x*–C active sites, can provide adequate accessible area for reactants and show very high catalytic activity.[32]

The as-prepared Fe-SilkPNC showed obviously sheet-like 2D structure with large planar area, as demonstrated by the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image (Figure 1b). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image (Figure 1c) confirms the 2D nanosheet morphology with nanopores throughout the nanosheet. Atomic force microscopy was further performed, revealing the nanosheet structure of Fe-SilkPNC with a smallest thickness below 10 nm (Figure S1, Supporting Information). The 2D porous nanosheet structure endows Fe-SilkPNC with a large specific surface area of about 2105 m2 g<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> , dominant pore size of about 3.0 nm and a total pore volume of about 1.5 cm3 g−<sup>1</sup> (Figure S2, Supporting Information). Besides, as shown in Figure 1d, high-resolution TEM image of Fe-SilkPNC shows obvious distorted lattice fringes corresponding to graphitic layers, which is in consistency with the Raman spectrum (inset in Figure 1d). The X-ray diffraction pattern of the Fe-SilkPNC shows a keen-edged peak at 2θ values of 20°–30°, which can be assigned to the (002) peaks of graphitic carbon (Figure S3, Supporting Information).

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurement was performed to further ascertain the chemical feature of Fe-SilkPNC. The XPS survey spectrum exhibited peaks corresponding to C, N, and O, while no significant Fe 2p peak can be detected (Figure S4, Supporting Information). High-resolution XPS spectrum of N 1s showed the coexistence of pyridininc and graphitic N species (Figure 1e), which is promising for efficient ORR activity.[33] Figure 1f–i displays the dark-field highresolution TEM image and corresponding energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) elemental mapping of Fe-SilkPNC, which demonstrate the presence of Fe in the Fe-SilkPNC, and show that C, N, and Fe atoms are homogeneously dispersed throughout the nanosheet. Inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) analysis was utilized to determine the Fe content, revealing the presence of trace Fe (≈0.12 wt%). Besides, it is noteworthy that no Zn can be detected by the ICP-OES, indicating ignorable Zn residue in the Fe-SilkPNC.

Aberration-corrected high angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy was performed to visualize the dispersion of Fe atoms in the 2D porous carbon nanosheet. As shown in Figure S5 (Supporting Information), some highly intense bright dots in the nanosheet can be intuitively seen, which can be ascribed to atomically-dispersed Fe atoms for the fact that the electron density of Fe atoms is much higher than that of C and N atoms. To further investigate the structure of Fe-SilkPNC in atomic level, X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) analysis was carried out. K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra of Fe-SilkPNC, Fe foil, and Fe2O3 were compared to determine the average oxidation state of Fe in Fe-SilkPNC. According to the XANES curves shown in **Figure 2**a, the Fe-SilkPNC showed near-edge absorption energy between that of the Fe foil and Fe2O3, suggesting that Fe single atoms bear a positive charge. The Fouriertransformed *k*<sup>3</sup> -weighted extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectrum of the Fe-SilkPNC exhibits only one main peak at ≈1.5 Å, which corresponds to the Fe-N/C first coordination shell (Figure 2b). No Fe–Fe coordination peak or other high shell peaks were detected, which indicated that no Fe–Fe bonds were formed, namely, Fe atoms were present in the Fe-SilkPNC as single atoms.

Furthermore, to obtain the quantitative chemical configuration of Fe atom in the Fe-SilkPNC, EXAFS fitting was performed. The EXAFS curves shown in Figure 2c,d and Figure S6 (Supporting Information), and the fitting parameters listed in Table S1 (Supporting Information) suggest that the coordination number of Fe atom was about 4, and the mean Fe–N/C bond length was 1.99 Å, indicating that the Fe atom in the Fe-SilkPNC is coordinated by four N atoms (see the proposed structure displayed by a schematic model (inset in Figure 2d)). As reference, the fitting curves of Fe foil are exhibited in Figure S7 in the Supporting Information. The above analysis demonstrated that Fe atoms in the Fe-SilkPNC was atomically anchored in the 2D N-doped porous carbon nanosheet and was coordinated with four N atoms, which could contribute to highly efficient oxygen reaction catalytic activity by altering the electronic structure of adjacent carbon atoms and the corresponding adsorption of reactants/intermediates.[23,34]

The atomically-dispersed Fe–N*x*–C active sites and the large surface area promise the Fe-SilkPNC with remarkable catalytic activity for oxygen reaction, especially for ORR. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) measurements on a rotating disc electrode (RDE) were carried out to investigate the electrocatalytic performance of the Fe-SilkPNC. As shown in **Figure 3**a, the Fe-SilkPNC exhibited superior ORR catalytic activity to commercial Pt/C catalyst in terms of more positive onset potential and half-wave potential (*E*1/2). The *E*1/2 of the Fe-SilkPNC was about 0.853 V which was 19 mV more positive than that of Pt/C. The Fe-SilkPNC also showed a more positive half-wave potential than that of SilkPNC (Figure S8, Supporting Information), indicating superior ORR activity with the presence of Fe species. The Tafel slopes determined from the curves shown in Figure 3b are 61.4, and 78. 0 mV dec<sup>−</sup>1 for Fe-SilkPNC and Pt/C, respectively, further confirming the Fe-SilkPNC is an outstanding ORR catalyst with faster kinetics than Pt/C. The superior apparent activity of the Fe-SilkPNC could be ascribed to the large surface density of atomically-dispersed Fe sites, superhigh specific surface area, and abundant micro-/mesopores of the Fe-SilkPNC, which afforded more accessible active sites and faster mass-transfer. Besides, according to the Koutecky–Levich (*K–L*) equation, the kinetic current density at 0.9 V of the Fe-SilkPNC was estimated to be ≈1.47 mA cm−<sup>2</sup> , which was higher than that of Pt/C (≈0.99 mA cm−<sup>2</sup> ), indicating higher intrinsic activity of the Fe-SilkPNC than Pt/C.

The ORR electron transfer number of the Fe-SilkPNC were studied by RDE measurement under various rotation speeds (Figure 3c). Figure 3d represents the corresponding *K–L* plots at **www.advancedsciencenews.com**

various potentials, the slope of which can be used to determine the electron transfer number (*n*). The average number calculated from the slopes of *K–L* plots was about 3.9, close to that of the theoretical 4-electron-reduction process. More remarkably, the Fe-SilkPNC exhibits extremely high cycling stability, which is of great importance for its potential practical applications in electrochemical energy devices. Accelerated durability test (ADTs) under harsh reaction conditions (potential range of 0.6–1.0 V, scan rate of 100 mV s−<sup>1</sup> , O2-saturated 0.1 m KOH) was performed to determine the stability of the Fe-SilkPNC. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of the Fe-SilkPNC after different cycles are almost overlapped with each other, initially implying the good stability of the Fe-SilkPNC (Figure S9, Supporting Information). As shown in Figure 3e, after different cycles, the Fe-SilkPNC showed slightly negative shift of *E*1/2, and decreased limiting current density. The decreased limiting current density may be attributed to the possible detachment of the Fe-SilkPNC from the RDE during the ADT process.

As for the *E*1/2, after 5000, and 30 000 cycles, the *E*1/2 of the Fe-SilkPNC declined by about 3 and 11 mV, respectively (Figure 3f), while the decline of *E*1/2 for Pt/C was about 47 mV after only 5000 cycles (Figure S10, Supporting Information), revealing the superior stability of the Fe-SilkPNC. According to the above results, the Fe-SilkPNC could be considered as one of the up to date best non-noble metal electrocatalysts for ORR (see Table S2 in the Supporting Information). Besides, the OER catalytic activity of the Fe-SilkPNC was also measured in 1.0 m KOH. The Fe-SilkPNC displays a lower onset potential and higher current density than Pt/C, indicating the potential bifunctional activity of the Fe-SilkPNC for ORR and OER (Figure S11, Supporting Information). The fascinating electrocatalytic activity and stability of the Fe-SilkPNC for ORR can be ascribed to its unique structure: (i) atomically-dispersed Fe–N4 sites, contributing to the observed high ORR reactivity by easily transferring electron to the absorbed OH\* species[19,23]; (ii) 2D porous nanosheet structure with high surface area, facilitating mass adsorption and transportation; (iii) chemically-stable graphitic carbon support, improving the stability under harsh catalytic conditions.[35,36]

In conclusion, we developed a facile approach for preparation of 2D porous carbon nanosheets with atomically-dispersed Fe–N*x*–C active sites and large surface area, which is realized through pyrolysis of Fe/Zn ions-anchored regenerated silk fibroin. The synergistic combination of three factors, including the 2D lamellar structure of the regenerated silk fibroin, the strong interaction between Fe ions and amino groups, and the pore-creating effect of Zn ions, enables the generation of 2D porous carbon nanosheets with atomically-dispersed Fe–N*x*–C and large surface area. Owing to the atomic dispersion of Fe–N*x*–C active sites throughout the porous nanosheets with large surface area, the as-prepared material exhibited superior oxygen reaction catalytic activity and stability to commercial

### **Experimental Section**

Preparation of the Fe-SilkPNC: Degummed silk fibers or silk textile (1.5 g) were dissolved in FeCl<sub>3</sub>/ZnCl<sub>2</sub> aqueous solution (25 mL solution with FeCl<sub>3</sub> of 2.5 M and ZnCl<sub>2</sub> of 1.1 M) at 100 °C. The obtained silk fibroin solution was dried on a heating stage at 150 °C to get solid regenerated silk fibroin containing Fe and Zn ions. Then the regenerated silk fibroin precursor was pyrolyzed in a tube furnace with a programmed heating procedure and a mixed atmosphere of argon and hydrogen. The programmed heating procedure includes: (i) heating from room temperature to 120 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min<sup>-1</sup>; (ii) heating to 220 °C at a rate of 5 °C min<sup>-1</sup> and keeping for 45 min; (iii) heating to 320 °C at a rate of 5 °C min-1 and keeping for 150 min; (iv) heating to 900 °C at a rate of 3 °C min<sup>-1</sup> and keeping for 120 min; (v) naturally cooling to room temperature. After pyrolysis, the obtained carbon was thoroughly washed by 6 M HCl to remove generated Fe nanoparticles and some soluble salts. Finally, the Fe-SilkPNC was collected by vacuum filtration and then dried on a heating stage after being washed by deionized water.

Structure Characterization: A field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, FEI Quanta 450) and a field emission transmission electron microscope (FE-TEM, JEOL JEM2010F) were utilized to characterize the morphology and structure of the Fe-SilkPNC. The X-ray diffraction pattern was recorded on a powder X-ray diffractometer

(Rigaku RINT D/Max-2500) using CuKa (40 kV, 40 mA) radiation. XPS measurements were carried out using Al K $\alpha$  radiation (Thermo Scientific Escalab 250Xi). The concentration of Fe in the Fe-SilkPNC was determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy. The XAFS spectra (Fe K-edge) were collected at 1W1B station in Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility. The measurement details of XAFS spectra (Fe K-edge) and the analysis of XAFS spectra were referred to one recently published work. [17]

Electrochemical Evaluation: A potentiostat/galvanostat Model 263A equipped with a RDE system (PINE Research Instruments) was utilized to evaluate the oxygen reaction catalytic activity. CV and LSV were performed in  $O_2$  saturated or  $N_2$ -saturated 0.10  $\,\rm M$  KOH solution with the scan rate of 100.0 mV s $^{-1}$  for CV and 10.0 mV s $^{-1}$  for LSV measurement, respectively. Notably, the mass loading of electrocatalysts on the working electrode was 0.6 mg m $^{-2}$ .

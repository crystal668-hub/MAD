Yi Wang, Miao Yang, Shu Liu, Wei Shen, Rongxing He, Yimin Jiang,\* and Ming Li\*

The direct utilization of biomass waste to design catalysts with high stability and excellent electrochemical activity is still the key challenge in the development of fuel cells. Herein, the structural modification of precursors obtained by the carbonization of walnut shells is carried out and several highly N-doped carbon catalysts with porous structures and excellent graphitization degrees are achieved. These catalysts have a high content of pyridinic-N species and high specific surface area. Herein, it is shown that one of these catalysts, WS350Z900@Fe, has a higher stability than the Pt/C catalyst and excellent oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance with an onset potential of 0.98 V and a half-wave potential of 0.86 V through a four-electron reaction mechanism. Furthermore, density functional theory calculation indicates that the rate-determining step of the ORR of these catalysts is the protonation of \*O<sub>2</sub>. Also, the pyridinic-N structure is conductive to reduce the reaction barrier. Herein, a significant means for designing inexpensive and high-efficient ORR catalysts utilizing biowaste materials is offered.

#### 1. Introduction

Developing environmental friendly energy storage and conversion devices, including fuel cells (FCs)<sup>[1]</sup> and metal-air batteries (MABs),<sup>[2]</sup> has triggered significant interest, owing to the worldwide energy crisis and environment issues.<sup>[3]</sup> The sluggish dynamic behavior and multiple reaction pathway of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) occurring in the cathode of FCs and MABs limited its commercialization.<sup>[4]</sup> To date, platinum (Pt) and its alloys are the commercial catalysts for the ORR, but their rare reserve, high cost, and worse stability largely restrict the practical applications in FCs and MABs.<sup>[5]</sup> Therefore, seeking

out inexpensive, more stable, and highefficient ORR catalysts to replace Pt-based ones is an extremely urgent task.

Since Gong et al. reported the nitrogencontaining carbon nanotubes, which showed superior ORR activity in 2009, [6] great efforts have been put into studying nitrogen-doped carbon materials, which could be promising potential materials to substitute Pt-based catalysts. Recently, many kinds of N-doped carbon catalysts with superior ORR properties in alkaline electrolyte were reported.<sup>[7]</sup> Dai and coworkers<sup>[8]</sup> synthesized N-doped graphene catalyst via chemical vapor deposition of methane and ammonia. It shows a better ORR activity than platinum in alkaline media, whereas the synthetic route was complicated. To simplify the synthetic method, more attention focused on the natural biomass materials, which were treated as direct precursors or nitrogen sources to

synthesize N-doped carbon catalysts.<sup>[9]</sup> Liu et al. chose shrimp shells as nitrogen and carbon sources to prepare 3D N-doped carbon materials by a hard-template-assisted method. [9g] The catalyst displays noticeable ORR activity, long-term durability, and outstanding methanol tolerance in alkaline media. Sung and coworkers<sup>[10]</sup> obtained a porous N-doped carbon catalyst by single-step carbonization of coffee wastes. The catalyst exhibits good catalytic activity for both ORR and triiodide reduction reaction. Liu's and Sung's works manifested that it is reasonable to choose structural diversity and abundant biomass as the carbon source to synthesize catalysts. Unfortunately, although these N-doped carbon materials display good catalytic activity, the doping efficiency of nitrogen, the elimination of SiO2 hard templates, and the building of porous substances are unsatisfactory. Thus, it is of great significance to select suitable biomass materials to prepare high-nitrogen-doped porous carbon catalysts in a convenient and simple way.

Walnut shell (WS) is one of the Earth's abundant biomass wastes and can be obtained easily and cheaply. It not only contains relatively large amounts of carbon and nitrogen, but also has a rich pore structure, which contributed to form ORR active sites. To our best knowledge, WS was only used in the fields of lightweight microwave absorption and environmental protection. [11] Considering its above advantages and easy preparation, WS should be utilized and recycled in more fields. However, the catalyst obtained by the direct carbonization of WSs has no good

catalytic property. Recent studies have shown that ZnCl2 can degrade cellulosic structure and promote dehydration, which leads to carbonization and aromatization of carbon to form a pore structure. [12] Moreover, FeCl<sub>3</sub> is beneficial to the graphitization of the carbon structure. [13] Combining them effectively is a good strategy to improve the catalytic performance. In this work, WS biomass was chosen as the raw material and carbonized to prepare WS350 precursor. Furthermore, the structure of the precursor was modified by secondary carbonization and acid leaching. During carbonization, ZnCl<sub>2</sub> was used to promote the formation of the porous structure, [12] whereas FeCl<sub>3</sub> assisted the graphitization procedure of WS350 precursors. [13] Ultimately, a highly active nitrogen-doped porous catalyst (WS350Z900@Fe) was obtained. The results demonstrated that WS350Z900@Fe shows a superior ORR catalytic activity, outstanding durability, and a methanol-tolerant property in alkaline media. The excellent ORR activity of WS350Z900@Fe originates from its high pyridinic-N species, a large Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of 1658 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>, as well as the porous structure. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation results suggested that the protonation of \*O<sub>2</sub> on WS350Z900@Fe is the rate-limiting step.

# 2. Results and Discussion

### 2.1. Morphology and Structural Characterization

Raman spectroscopy was measured to evaluate the degree of defects or disorder of carbon materials. As shown in Figure 1a,

two apparent peaks are exhibited at about 1330 and 1596 cm<sup>-1</sup>, corresponding to the D and G bands.<sup>[14]</sup> The D band is associated with structural defects, whereas the G band results from the graphitic carbon phase.<sup>[15]</sup> Generally, the ratio of intensities of D band and G band  $(I_D/I_G)$  is used to estimate the carbon defects caused by physical pores. It can be found that the value of  $I_D/I_C$ increases from 0.8898 for WS350900 to 1.109 for WS350Z900, indicating that WS350Z900 has a higher defect and disorder degree than WS350900. This result is due to the numerous porous structures in carbon materials, which arise from the activation of ZnCl2 (treated as the chemical activator to generate pores) for materials. However, the ratio of  $I_D/I_G$  decreases to 0.9145 for WS350Z900@Fe, which might be ascribed to the fact that the reductive Fe<sup>0</sup> could accelerate the graphitization process during pyrolysis. [13] In addition, ZnCl2 would further promote the graphitization process, thereby facilitating the structural transformation from amorphous carbon to graphitic carbon.<sup>[16]</sup> BET and Barrette-Joynere-Halenda (BJH) pore size distribution analyses were used to explore the surface area and pore structure of catalysts using N2 adsorption-desorption experiments. As shown in Figure 1b and Figure S1, Supporting Information, all the catalysts possess type IV physisorption isotherms according to the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) classification results. The BET surface area of WS350Z900@Fe is 1658 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>, which is higher than that of WS350Z900 (1432  $\text{m}^2\text{g}^{-1}$ ) and WS350900 (876  $\text{m}^2\text{g}^{-1}$ ). The relatively high surface area of WS350Z900@Fe is caused by the removal of metal iron species and the dehydration of ZnCl<sub>2</sub>.

ZnCl<sub>2</sub> as a chemical activator would accelerate the dehydration of oxygen- and hydrogen-containing groups and dissolve the WS to form pores. [12] For WS350Z900@Fe, a sharp increase in the curve is observed at a low pressure ( $P/P_0 < 0.1$ ), which manifests the presence of micropores. A H4 hysteresis loop is clearly observed at medium pressure (0.5  $< P/P_0 <$  1.0), which suggests that it has mesopores, [5a] which is beneficial to the exposure of more active sites in ORR. The pore size distribution of WS350Z900@Fe shown in the inset of Figure 1b and Figure S1c, Supporting Information, demonstrates that the pore size is mainly focused on about 3.8 nm, which is consistent with the nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms. The microscopic morphology and structure of WS350900, WS350Z900, and WS350Z900@Fe were investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As shown in Figure 1c,d and Figure S2, Supporting Information, it shows an amorphous microstructure. which was mainly caused by the numerous defects on the surface and exposed edges of the catalysts.<sup>[17]</sup> In addition, the fast Fourier transform (FFT) analysis also clarified that WS350Z900@Fe displays an amorphous structure with a low degree of crystallinity (insets of Figure 1d). X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) was carried out to characterize the crystal-phase structure of the catalysts. Two broad weak peaks can be observed in Figure S3, Supporting Information. It demonstrates a low graphitization degree and the amorphous characteristic of the porous catalyst, which is in accordance with TEM images.

To further investigate the chemical bonding and elemental composition of prepared catalysts, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was performed. As shown in Figure 2a, the

XPS diagrams of all materials have characteristic peaks of C, N, and O elements, verifying the existence C, N, and O in WS. However, the contents of C, N, and O elements in these materials are very different, especially for N species. As shown in Table 1, the relative contents of doped nitrogen (N/C) in WS350Z900@Fe, WS350Z900, and WS350900 are 4.1, 3.4, and 2.1 at%, respectively. Thus, WS350Z900@Fe has the highest doped N content among the three materials, indicating that the N-doping level significantly increases with ZnCl<sub>2</sub> activation and FeCl<sub>3</sub> graphitization. The high-resolution XPS result of C1s of WS350Z900@Fe is shown in Figure 2b. Obviously, there are four forms of carbon, C—C, C—N, C—O, and C=O, situated at 284.5, 285.9, 286.4, and 288.9 eV, respectively. [18] The existence of C-N species further demonstrates the successful incorporation of nitrogen into the carbon matrix. As shown in Figure 2c and Figure S4, Supporting Information, the N1s

spectra of WS350Z900 and WS350900 could be divided into three peaks at about 401.0, 399.5, and 398.5 eV, which are attributed to graphitic-N, pyrrolic-N, and pyridinic-N, respectively. [19] However, for WS350Z900@Fe, only two peaks corresponding to graphitic-N (401.0 eV) and pyridinic-N (398.5 eV) species are found in its high-resolution XPS picture (Figure 2d). Further, the contents of different types of N are measured and summarized in Table 1. The relative content of pyridinic-N is up to 60.26% for WS350Z900@Fe, whereas the contents are only 29.35% and 33.68% for WS350Z900 and WS350900, respectively. Combining with the contents of doped nitrogen in WS350Z900@Fe, WS350Z900, and WS350900 discussed earlier, we considered that the presence of ZnCl2 and FeCl3 in the precursor could reduce the loss of nitrogen and promote the transformation of pyrrolic-N to pyridinic-N during the hightemperature annealing process. Moreover, it is known that pyridinic-N is identified as the mainly ORR active sites in catalysts due to its electron-withdrawing property; [20] thus, WS350Z900@Fe would have a better ORR catalytic activity among the three materials.

#### 2.2. ORR Performance Evaluation

The ORR catalytic performance of the synthesized materials was investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) measurements in a  $N_{2}$ - or  $O_{2}$ -saturated 0.1 M KOH solution. As shown in **Figure 3**a, all the catalysts do not show peaks in the  $N_{2}$ -saturated solvent, whereas they display obvious

ORR peaks in the O2-saturated solution, demonstrating that these catalysts show an ORR catalytic activity to some extent. Notably, WS350Z900@Fe exhibits the best ORR property with the most positive peak potential of 0.95 V than WS350Z900 (0.80 V) and WS350900 (0.75 V), even comparable with the Pt/C catalyst. In Figure 3b, the onset potential ( $E_{onset}$ ), half-wave potential  $(E_{1/2})$ , and limiting current density of WS350Z900@Fe are 0.98, 0.86, and  $-5.98\,\mathrm{mA\,cm}^{-2}$ , which are slightly superior to those of many other metal-free or biomass-derived catalysts and very close to the state-of-the-art Pt/C catalyst ( $E_{\text{onset}} = 0.98 \text{ V}$ and  $E_{1/2} = 0.85 \text{ V}$ ), as summarized in Table S1 and S2, Supporting Information. Moreover, the Tafel slope of WS350Z900@Fe is smaller than that of Pt/C (89 mV  $dec^{-1}$ ) with the value of 79 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>, further indicating an efficient ORR process (Figure S5, Supporting Information). To study the ORR kinetic mechanism, the rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) test was measured. As known, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is a by-product generated during ORR through a two-electron reduction path, and the production of H2O2 is unfavorable to the ORR. The measured H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> yield is shown in Figure 3d. The H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> yield on WS350Z900@Fe is below 15% all along and less than 3% in the low potential range, whereas those values of 45% and 40% on WS350900 and WS350Z900, respectively, are much higher, which implies that WS350Z900@Fe displays a more prominent catalytic performance. This can be further confirmed by the electron transfer number (n) during ORR. As shown in Figure 3d, the value of n for WS350Z900@Fe is 3.8, which is close to 4.0, whereas for WS350900 and WS350Z900 their values

are in the range of 2.0–3.6, illustrating that WS350Z900@Fe catalyzes the ORR through a primarily four-electron reduction path ( $O_2 + 2H_2O + 4e^- = 4OH^-$ ), which is similar to the Pt/C catalyst.

To explore the optimal pyrolysis temperature, several other catalysts were also prepared under 700, 800, and 1000 °C, which were named as WS350ZX@Fe (X = 700, 800, and 1000 °C). As shown in Figure 4a-d, WS350Z900@Fe displays the maximal current density and the most positive  $E_{onset}$  and  $E_{1/2}$  potentials, as well as the lowest H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> yield (3%), demonstrating that it has the most prominent ORR activity. The performance of other three catalysts decreases gradually in the following order: WS350Z1000@Fe, WS350Z800@Fe, and WS350Z700@Fe. Hence, we can conclude that the best temperature is 900 °C in our work, as a higher or lower temperature will contribute to inferior ORR electrocatalytic activity. In addition, to determine whether the catalytic activity is caused by the possible remaining iron or zinc in carbon materials, inductively coupled plasmamass spectroscopy (ICP-MS) was performed. No other metals were found in the catalyst. This result can be further proved by XPS data. There are no characteristic peaks related to Fe species in Fe 2p spectrum of WS350Z900@Fe (Figure S6, Supporting Information).

The RDE tests were also carried out to obtain the kinetic parameters of WS350Z900@Fe. It is shown in **Figure 5**a that the limiting current density increases with the increase of rotational

speed, and the corresponding Koutecky-Levich (K-L) plots of WS350Z900@Fe are shown in Figure 5b. The K-L plots of WS350Z900@Fe exhibit a good linear relationship, suggesting that ORR on WS350Z900@Fe keeps to a first-order kinetics relative to the solvent oxygen concentration in the solution. The electron transfer number of WS350Z900@Fe is 3.85 at the selected potential values (see the inset of Figure 5b). This result demonstrates that WS350Z900@Fe catalyzes ORR through a four-electron pathway, which is in agreement with the previously mentioned RRDE consequence. The durability test was evaluated by 5000 continuous cyclic measurements with a scanning rate of 100 mV s<sup>-1</sup> at a potential range of 0.2-1.2 V (relative to RHE, see Figure 5c). For WS350Z900@Fe, the limiting current descends slightly and the half-wave potential negatively shifts only by 10 mV after 5000 cycles in the O2-saturated alkaline solution. However, for Pt/C, the limiting current declines sharply and the negative shift potential is up to 40 mV (the inset of Figure 5c). This indicates that WS350Z900@Fe displays a better long-term stability than that of Pt/C. Meanwhile, the methanol tolerance was performed for WS350Z900@Fe and Pt/C catalysts. As shown in Figure 5d, the measured curve of Pt/C has a strong response and displays a sharp current fluctuation after adding 3 M methanol to the O2-saturated KOH solution. In contrast, WS350Z900@Fe shows an inappreciable current fluctuation, suggesting that WS350Z900@Fe has remarkable methanol-tolerance ability relative to Pt/C.

To deeply understand the excellent ORR activity of WS350Z900@Fe, the free energies of different intermediates on the active sites of WS350Z900@Fe and WS350Z900 were calculated by the DFT. In alkaline medium, there are two possible pathways for the four-electron reaction, namely dissociative and associative ones. In our calculations, the associative mechanism is dominant and the most favorable pathway (the details are summarized in Supporting Information 3–4). As shown in Figure 6a, when the electrode potential is 1.23 V, although the last three

steps are exothermic, the first step, \*O2 protonation, is endothermic. This consequence demonstrates that \*O2 protonation (\*O2 þ H2O þ e ! \*OOH þ OH) is the slowest step and thus the rate-determining step of the entire ORR procedure. The ORR catalytic ability can be evaluated by directly comparing the corresponding value of free energy changes (ΔG).[21] For the ratedetermining step, ΔG of 1.67 eV for WS350Z900@Fe is smaller than 2.08 eV for WS350Z900, indicating that WS350Z900@Fe has a better adsorption behavior and a more outstanding

ORR performance. This can be attributed to the fact that WS350Z900@Fe contains more pyridinic-N (electron-withdrawing group) than WS350Z900, that is, a large amount of pyridinic-N species in WS350Z900@Fe attracts electrons from their neighboring carbon atoms, thus accelerating the protonation of \*O2. As shown in Figure 6b, when the electrode potential is 0.87 V, the ORR catalyzed by WS350Z900@Fe displays a downhill tendency for all the elemental reactions, which implies a minimum overpotential of 0.36 V for WS350Z900@Fe. Similarly, the minimum overpotential for WS350Z900 shown in Figure 6c is 0.48 V, indicating a higher value than that of WS350Z900@Fe. This result demonstrates that WS350Z900@Fe shows a higher catalytic activity than WS350Z900 toward ORR, which is consistent with the experimental results. The reason for this fact is that WS350Z900@Fe has a larger amount of pyridinic-N species as active sites than WS350Z900.

#### 3. Conclusion

In summary, the high-pyridinic-N-doped porous carbon catalysts toward the ORR, including WS350900, WS350Z900, and WS350Z900@Fe, have been synthesized via the structural modification of precursors obtained by the carbonization of biomass waste, WS. The optimal WS350Z900@Fe catalyst exhibits excellent ORR activity with the onset potential and half-wave potential of 0.98 and 0.86 V close to that of the commercial Pt/C catalyst. More importantly, WS350Z900@Fe has a remarkable stability and good methanol tolerance, which are both obviously superior to the Pt/C catalyst. Our study shows that the prominent ORR activity of WS350Z900@Fe is mainly ascribed to its porous structure, a high BET surface area, and an abundant amount of pyridinic-N. In addition, theoretical calculations reveal that the reaction barrier of \*O2 protonation can be reduced greatly by the large amount of pyridinic-N as the active sites, which result in the outstanding ORR activity of WS350Z900@Fe. The present work provides a useful insight to synthesize superior activation and high-stability ORR catalysts derived from sustainable biomass wastes.

## 4. Experimental Section

First, the WS350 precursor (WS and 350 represent the WS and the heating temperature, respectively, same below) was produced by the carbonization of WS biomass, and the temperature of 350 °C was used to maintain for 2 h with a heating rate of  $10\,^{\circ}\text{C}\,\text{min}^{-1}$  under a  $N_2$  flow tube furnace. Subsequently, 1.25 g of the WS350 precursor, 2.50 g of ZnCl<sub>2</sub> (mass ratio was 1:2), and 0.40 g FeCl<sub>3</sub> (5.0 wt% Fe) were sufficiently mingled by ball milling for 3 h at 500 r min<sup>-1</sup>. Then, second carbonization was proceeded with in a tubular furnace at four given temperatures (700, 800, 900, and 1000 °C) under N<sub>2</sub> atmosphere. The heating rate was 5 °C min<sup>-</sup> and time was 2 h. The N-doped carbon materials of WS350ZX@Fe  $(Z = ZnCl_2, Fe = FeCl_3, X refers to the second carbonization temperature$ = 700, 800, 900, and 1000  $^{\circ}$ C) were collected at room temperature. In contrast, the WS350900 (900 represents the secondary carbonization temperature) catalyst was prepared using the same way without ZnCl<sub>2</sub> and FeCl<sub>3</sub>. Similarly, WS350Z900 was also obtained with the addition of ZnCl<sub>2</sub>. Finally, a series of WS materials were immersed in 3 M HCl solution for 12 h to remove the excessive metal elements. All the prepared products were washed by distilled water and dried overnight at 60 °C.

Iron-nitrogen-carbon graphitic (Fe-N-C), a noble metal-free catalyst holds a lot of promise to substitute platinum (Pt) as an efficient catalyst in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, the synthesis process and the stabilization of single atoms that tend to aggregate, without jeopardizing the catalytic activity remain challenging. Here we demonstrate a stabilized assisted method for the preparation of Fe-N-C electrocatalyst by using graphitic carbon nitride (g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>) nanosheet as a template. Fe ions are absorbed on the surface of g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> and imprisoned after the addition of pyrrole, preventing Fe migration that may result in nanoparticles. During the pyrolysis, Fe atoms coordinated with N provided by g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> and pyrrole on graphitic carbon to form Fe-N-C with a metal loading of 5.4 wt%. Moreover, FeN<sub>x</sub> species were introduced in the graphitic carbon, where the coexistence of micro and electrocatalytic performance with a half-wave potential ( $E_{1/2}$ ) of 0.82 V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)) higher than Fe/NP (0.76 V) and close to Pt/C, with a superior long stability of 85% in alkaline media after 40000 s.

The brutal environmental issues have raised demand for renewable energy storage and stimulated efforts on the development of clean conversion devices such as metal-air batteries and fuel cells. 1-3 Proton-exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) dominated the market of electrochemical devices, owing to their flexibility and solid polymer electrolytes. However, anion exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs) with a less corrosive environment have privileged a resurgence of interest, notably their high efficiency and low cost in low power applications such as hybrid vehicles.<sup>4–7</sup> Nonetheless the sluggish oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) that happens on the cathodic side of AEMFCs is recognized as the major bottleneck. Platinum (Pt)-based electrocatalysts are still commonly used to reduce the ORR barrier but the poor stability and the scarcities associated with Pt result in higher costs.<sup>2,8</sup> Therefore, those challenges have encouraged the exploration of efficient and lowcost alternatives with a superior durability to substitute Pt-based catalysts.

Among the current alternatives, iron-nitrogen-carbon graphitic (Fe–N–C) catalysts distinguished themselves as the most viable choice for ORR. <sup>9–13</sup> The highly active N-coordinated single atom Fe sites (FeN<sub>x</sub>) in Fe–N–C have been proved to be the principal participant to the enhanced ORR. <sup>14–16</sup> The catalytic performance of those catalysts is influenced by a number of parameters, including the coordination environments, the metal-support interaction and the metal loading, offering new options for increasing the ORR performance. <sup>17,18</sup> Accordingly, various approaches have been proposed for selective preparation of atomically active FeN<sub>x</sub> sites in Fe–N–C catalysts. For example, a silica-protective-layer-assisted method was employed by Joo et al., <sup>19</sup> the prepared material exhibited a higher density of FeN<sub>x</sub> sites than the material prepared without silica coating. Zhou et al. <sup>20</sup> prepared atomic Fe dispersed on mesoporous carbon nanosphere by a coordination-assisted polymerization strategy, achieving a 2.9 wt% of Fe content.

Although single atom catalysts can be synthesized in both two and three-dimensional (3D) materials, single atom catalysts anchored on the 2D substrates provides greater advantages including greater mass transfer process and regulation of the electronic structure. Graphitic carbon nitride  $(g\text{-}C_3N_4)$  aroused tremendous interest as a support of single atom catalysts owing to its high N content and its special structure that allow the single atoms to anchor in the framework within six-fold coordination sites formed by

adjacent nitride atoms.  $^{21,22}$  However, in electrocatalysis, g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> is revealed to have a poor conductivity due to the layers that are connected via van der walls bonds. Moreover, the synthesis approach commonly involves two steps pyrolysis that can obstruct the porosity and the structure, causing a poor concentration of FeN<sub>x</sub> and the formation of Fe nanoparticles rather than FeN<sub>x</sub> active sites.  $^{23-28}$  A polymerization of a monomer that can be used as nanosheets to further stabilize Fe atoms can be an innovative strategy to firmly anchor the single atoms and allow their uniform dispersion; offering a new versatile platform for a powerful stabilization.

Here, we describe a facile stabilized method for the synthesis of Fe–N–C catalyst. g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> was selected as a removable template, which will be decomposed to nitrogen moieties at above 700 °C. The lone pairs in the ligands attract Fe ions where they are further coated by polypyrrole (PPy) prior the pyrolysis. The confinement provided by PPy inhibited the migration of Fe, resulting in the formation of single atom catalyst. The catalyst obtained with the optimized synthesis condition (Fe–N–C) showed the existence of Fe single atoms. The addition of pyrrole increased the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) specific surface area to 238 m² g⁻¹, compared to Fe/NP without pyrrole (44 m² g⁻¹) and benefit the formation of micropores. Fe–N–C exhibited a four-electron ORR pathway with half-wave potential of ( $E_{1/2}$ ) of 0.82 V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)) close to Pt/C ( $E_{1/2} = 0.84$  V) catalyst and a longer stability in alkaline media. Thus, providing a promising alternative for Pt-based catalyst.

#### **Experimental**

*Materials and reagent.*—The chemicals and reagents were purchased from different companies. Iron (III) nitrate nonahydrate (Fe(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>.9H<sub>2</sub>O), urea and ethanol were from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd Pyrrole was from Rhawan reagent, and ammonium persulfate was from Shanghai Aladdin Bio-Chem Technology Co., Ltd The chemicals did not require any purification prior their utilization.

Synthesis of Fe/NP.—In a typical procedure, 10 mg of g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> already prepared (Supporting information) was dispersed into 12 ml of ethanol and mixed with a solution containing 40 mg of Fe(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>.9H<sub>2</sub>O pre-dispersed in 2 ml of ethanol. The mixture was sonicated for 30 min to form Fe<sup>3+</sup>/g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>, washed with deionized (DI) water and cooled with liquid nitrogen (boiling point –196 °C). After freeze-drying overnight, the sample was heated for 1 h at

 $800~^{\circ}\text{C}~(2~^{\circ}\text{C}~\text{min}^{-1})$  under Argon (Ar) flow at a rate of  $100~\text{ml}~\text{min}^{-1}$ . The obtained material was labelled Fe/NP

Synthesis of Fe-N-C.—The synthesis of Fe-N-C required at first the preparation of Fe³+/g-C₃N₄. After that, 124  $\mu L$  of pyrrole was added into Fe³+/g-C₃N₄ mixture and stirred for 20 min, the color went from yellow to dark green. Then 1 ml of ammonium persulfate aqueous solution (0.18 g) was added into above mixture and stirred for 24 h. The obtained product polypyrrole/Fe³+/g-C₃N₄/polypyrrole (PPy/Fe³+/g-C₃N₄/Ppy) was centrifuged with ethanol three times, then washed with DI water and cooled with nitrogen liquid. After freeze-drying overnight, the obtained powder was subjected to thermal activation at 800 °C (2 °C min $^{-1}$ ) for 1 h under Ar flow (100 ml min $^{-1}$ ). The obtained catalyst was designated as Fe–N–C.

Characterization.—The Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern was obtained with D8 ADVANCED at scanning speed of 2° min<sup>-1</sup> with Cu K $\alpha$  radiation ( $\lambda = 1.54$  Å). The morphology of the different samples was collected by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) on JEOL JSM-7610F, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) and elemental mapping on FEI Tecnai G2 F30 S-Twin working at 300 kV. Fe-N-C catalyst was characterized with aberration-corrected high-angle annular dark-field-scanning transmission electron microscopy HAADF-STEM) conducted by a JEOL JEM-ARM 200 F. The specific surface area and the pore size distribution were determined with BET method and density functional theory (DFT), both acquired on quanta chrome instrument Nova 3000e. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out on Thermo ESCALAB c 250Xi. The carbon located at 284.8 eV was used to calibrate all the element of the samples. Thermo Avantage software (5.979 version) was used to treat the fine structure of the photoelectron lines. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy was used to measure the Fe loading (ICP-MS avio 200).

Electrochemical measurements.—The electrochemical measurements were performed in 0.1 M potassium hydroxide (KOH) electrolyte conducted on CHI Electrochemical Station (Model760E). 2.5 mg of catalyst was dispersed in a mixture containing 0.490 ml ethanol and 0.5 wt% Nafion solution (0.1 ml), the mixture was stirred overnight and sonicated for 30 min before being loaded on glassy carbon rotating disk electrode (RDE, d = 5 mm) and rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE, d = 5.61 mm) that served as working electrodes  $(0.75~{\rm mg~cm}^{-2}~{\rm of~catalyst~loading}).$  The Pt/C  $(20~{\rm wt\%})$  catalyst with a loading of 0.1 mg cm<sup>-2</sup> was tested for comparison. The carbon rod was the counter electrode and the Ag/AgCl (Saturated KCl solution) was the reference electrode. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves were conducted in O2 and N2-saturated 0.1 M KOH electrolyte at a scan rate of 50 mV s<sup>-1</sup>, prior to test the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) following the same potential window (-1.0 to 0.2 V) with a scanning rate of 5 mV s<sup>-1</sup>. The obtained potentials were reported in RHE according to the formula 1 for the conversion:

<span id="page-2-0"></span>
$$E_{vs RHE} = E_{vsAg/AgCl} + E^{0}_{Ag/AgCl} + 0.059 \quad pH(in volts)$$
[1]

Tafel plots for ORR, the kinetic current was obtained through the calculation from the mass-transport correction of RDE according to this equation:

$$J_k = \frac{J \times J_L}{J_I - J} \tag{2}$$

Where  $(J_k)$  is related to the kinetic current density, J is the mass transport corrected kinetic current density, and the diffusion-limited current density  $(J_L)$ .

$$O_2 + 2H_2O + 4e^- \rightarrow 4OH^-$$
 [3]

$$O_2 + H_2O + 2e^- \rightarrow HO_2^- + HO^-$$
 [4]

<span id="page-2-3"></span><span id="page-2-2"></span>The hydroperoxide anion can be reduced into OH<sup>-</sup> following the reaction 5

$$HO_2^- + H_2O + 2e^- \rightarrow 3OH^-$$

The hydrogen peroxide  $(H_2O_2)$  yield can be directly measured by oxidizing it on the ring disk via this equation:

$$HO_2^- + OH^- \rightarrow O_2 + H_2O + 2e^-$$
 [6]

The electron transfer number (n) per  $O_2$  molecules involves in the ORR and percentage of  $O_2$  molecules that are reduced to  $HO_2^-$  were obtained by measuring the ring current at 0.5 V and calculated from the following equations based on the RRDE results:

$$n = 4 \times \frac{I_D}{\frac{I_R}{N} + I_D}$$
 [7]

$$H_2O_2(\%) = \frac{200\frac{I_R}{N}}{\frac{I_R}{N} + I_D}$$
 [8]

Where,  $I_D$  is the disk current,  $I_R$  is the ring current and N is the collection efficiency (0.37). The N value in our system was provided by the manufacturer, defined by

$$N = \frac{I_R}{I_D}$$
 [9]

Current-time (i–t) chronoamperometric measurement was employed for long-term stability and methanol tolerance tests, recorded for 40 000 s at -0.35 V (Vs Ag/AgCl) at a rotating speed of 1600 rpm.

#### **Results and Discussion**

Morphology, microstructure and elemental composition.— Figure 1 describes the synthesis method of Fe-N-C electrocatalyst. Fe<sup>3+</sup> ions in Fe(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>.9H<sub>2</sub>O were absorbed on the surface of  $g-C_3N_4$  to form  $Fe^{3+}/g-C_3N_4$ . Pyrrole that polymerized in presence of ammonium persulfate was later added to further stabilize Fe<sup>3+</sup> confined in g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> to achieve a sheet-like PPy/Fe<sup>3+</sup>/g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>/PPy. Subsequently, the special coordination structure anchored Fe atoms and prevented them from migrating during the pyrolysis process, while the g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> and PPy offered abundant nitrogen sources to construct Fe-N-C. The XRD patterns in Fig. 2a confirmed the formation of g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> through the pyrolysis of urea with two distinctive peaks at 13.0° for (100) plane and 27.6° for (002) of the interlayer stacking of aromatic system of g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>. Consistently, the SEM image in Fig. 2b showed the stacked layer morphology with some aggregates. After the addition of Fe precursor in g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> followed by thermal activation, Fe/NP exhibited peaks at 37.7°,42.9°, 43.9° and 48.9° corresponding to (210), (200), (102) and (131) of Fe<sub>3</sub>C and a peak at 44.7° for (110) of metallic iron (Fig. 2a), 35-37 evidenced by the TEM image (Fig. 2c) with the existence of differently sized particles from 9 nm to 77 nm. Nanotubes can also be observed, as the result of the metal-catalyzed carbonization process of g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> nanosheets. <sup>22,38</sup> On the other hand, no peaks related to Fe-based nanoparticles or clusters were detected for Fe-N-C in (Figs. 2a, 2d) indicating the stabilization function of pyrrole.<sup>39</sup> High-resolution transmission TEM (HR-TEM) corroborates the XRD results, with no Fe-based particles observed (Fig. 3a). The STEM area and the elemental mapping images of Fe-N-C

(Fig. 3b), demonstrated that the different elements C, N, Fe and O were homogeneously distributed all over the graphitic carbon. Furthermore, AC HAADF-STEM image showed individual bright spots dispersed over the carbon structure, indicating the existence of Fe single atoms (Fig. 3c). Contrasted with Fe/NP, the SAED image (Fig. S2a (available online at stacks.iop.org/JES/169/062501/mmedia)) exhibited bright spots with diffuse rings, further revealing the polycrystalline structure of metal aggregations. The Fe particles are dispersed on the entire carbon layer as exhibited in the STEM image (Fig. S2b). These results provided additional evidence that pyrrole had the function of stopping the migration of Fe.

The Nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms of the prepared materials are pictured in Fig. 4a. The hysteresis loop of the isotherms indicated the existence of mesopores and micropores in the samples at high pressure  $(P/P_0=0.45-1.0).^{2,40}$  The BET surface area was calculated for the three samples.  $g\text{-}C_3N_4$  had a BET specific surface area of 75 m² g $^{-1}$ . After the addition of Fe source, the surface area dropped dramatically for Fe/NP (44 m² g $^{-1}$ ). But, after the addition of PPy, the surface area of Fe–N–C increased consequently to reach 238 m² g $^{-1}$ . The pore size distribution displayed in Fig. 4b confirmed the distribution of micro and mesopores. It was found that Fe–N–C had the richest porous structure, with the formation of

micropores at 1.65 nm and a higher mesopores content within 6 nm to 9 nm (Fig. S3). The presence of micropores can host  $\text{FeN}_x$  sites, while the mesopores can provide better exposure of active sites, and diffusion of oxygen species. <sup>41</sup> Additionally, Fe/NP showed fewer mesopores and almost no micropores, caused by the Fe nanoparticles that obstructed the porous channel, leading in a decline of BET surface area.

XPS spectra of Fe/NP and Fe–N–C provided the elemental composition and the binding states of C, N and Fe (Fig. 5 and Table SI). High-resolution spectra for N 1 s revealed the co-existence of five types of N species, including pyridinic N (398.5 eV), Fe-N (399.5 eV), pyrrolic N (400.6 eV), graphitic N (401.5 eV) and oxidized N (402.7 eV) for both materials (Fig. 5a).  $^{42.43}$  Fe/NP had the lowest Fe-N content of 6.4% compared to Fe–N–C with 15.4%. It can be explained by the introduction of PPy that offered additional N for Fe–N–C to stabilize more Fe atoms, evidenced by the high N content (10.5 at%, Table SI). Additionally, pyridinic N was the main N species for both catalysts (Figs. 5a, 5d). Due to the shared electrons in  $\pi$  systems, a high pyridinic content provides more coordination to Fe atom to form Fe–N–C structure but also benefit for single Fe atoms to anchor.  $^{13,18,22,34}$  Moreover, graphitic N was reported to be conductive

for ORR.<sup>44</sup> In Fig. 5c, the signal at the lowest energy peak (707.1 eV) observed in Fe/NP is attributed to zero-valent Fe (Fe<sup>6</sup>) of metallic Fe or carbide, formed during the carbonization process, which is in correlation with XRD pattern.<sup>45,46</sup> The Fe 2p high-resolution scan of Fe-N-C can be deconvoluted into Fe <sup>2+</sup> (710 eV for 2p<sub>3/2</sub> and 723.1 eV for 2p<sub>1/2</sub>) and Fe<sup>3+</sup> (712.7 eV for 2p<sub>3/2</sub> and 727.9 eV for 2p<sub>1/2</sub>) species respectively. Notably the peaks assigned to Fe<sup>2+</sup> and to Fe<sup>3+</sup> in Fe/NP shifted to higher binding energy.<sup>47,48</sup> The C 1 s high-resolution spectra presented five peaks C-C (284.8), C-N/C-O

(285.8 eV), O = C–O (286.8 eV), carbonate (288.5 eV) and  $\pi$ – $\pi$ \* (292 eV) (Fig. 5b). <sup>45,49</sup>

Catalytic activity of Fe-N-C catalyst.—To assess the electrocatalytic performances of Fe-N-C and Fe/NP and the impact of PPy, CV measurements were first conducted. Both catalysts exhibited a cathodic peak related to the oxygen reduction process (Fig. 6a). The electrocatalytic activity towards ORR was later studied and compared to Pt/C using LSV (Fig. 6b). Fe/NP displayed a poor catalytic

activity with on-set potential  $(E_0)$  of 0.85 V and half-wave potential  $(E_{10})$  of 0.76 V attributed to the low density of FeN<sub>x</sub> active sites. After the addition of pyrrole, Fe-N-C demonstrated an enhanced ORR activity with  $E_0$  of 0.90 V and  $E_{1/2}$  of 0.82 V (Table SII), approaching Pt/C performance with  $E_{1/2}$  of 0.84 V (Table SII). Moreover Fe-N-C exhibited a performance that suppressed or equaled other reported works including Fe embedded N-doped carbon catalysts (Fe-N-C/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) with  $E_{1/2}$  of 0.79 V, <sup>42</sup> nitrogen-coordinated and carbon-embedded metal (Fe-N/Fe<sub>3</sub>C/C-800) with  $E_{1/2}$  of 0.82 V<sup>25</sup> and N, S, and Fe ternarydoped porous carbon aerogel (HDCA-800) with  $E_{1/2}$  of 0.79 V.<sup>50</sup> Tafel plots were calculated and given in Fig. 6c. Fe/NP exhibited a larger value (101 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>) than Fe-N-C with a slope of 84 mV dec<sup>-</sup> (Table SI). RRDE measurements monitored the percentage of peroxide yield H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and electron transfer number (n) of Fe-N-C contrasted to Pt/C as shown in Figs. 6d. The electron transfer n ranged from 3.91 to 3.98 in a potential range between 0.1 to 0.8 V, indicating that Fe-N-C followed a four-electron pathway for ORR. The H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> yield of Fe-N-C was higher than the Pt/c but was always below 5.5%. This difference was not observed in a potential range from 0.6 to 0.8 V, with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> neighboring 0%. Furthermore, the methanol tolerance of Fe-N-C was investigated for the practical application and compared to Pt/C for the appreciation of the performance (Fig. 6e). No obvious difference of the current density was noticed for Fe-N-C at 300 s, upon the addition of 3 M of methanol in the electrolyte. In opposition with Pt/C that was easily poisoned, pointing out the advantageous methanol tolerance of Fe-N-C. Additionally, the long-term stability investigated (Fig. 6f), demonstrates a slower degradation for Fe-N-C, with a current density retention of 85% superior to Pt/C by 11% after 40000 s.

The function of different synthesis parameters on the final ORR.—To further investigate the function of different synthesis parameters, including calcination temperature, Fe content, PPy and g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> of Fe-N-C on the final ORR activity. Several samples were prepared following the same synthesis method (Table SIII). It was observed in Fig. 7 that when the pyrolysis temperature is increasing,

<span id="page-6-1"></span>**Figure 7.** LSV curves of Fe–N–C/gCN, Fe–N–C/900, Fe–N–C/1000, Fe–N–C/Fe-1, Fe–N–C/Fe-2 and Fe–N–C and in  $O_2$ -saturated 0.1 M KOH electrolyte at 1600 rpm.

the ORR tend to decline as seen with the sample pyrolyzed at 1000 °C (Fe–N–C/1000) ( $E_{1/2}$  of 0.79 V) indicating that 800 °C is the optimum temperature (Table SIV). Moreover, the Fe precursor content of Fe(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>.9H<sub>2</sub>O was also adjusted during the synthesis. A lower Fe content (20 mg) led to a poor catalytic activity for Fe–N–C/Fe-1 with  $E_{1/2}$  of 0.76 V, caused by the limited density of active sites, however, a higher amount (60 mg of Fe(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>.9H<sub>2</sub>O) provoked a decline in the activity as seen with Fe–N–C/Fe-2. It can be explained by the transformation of FeN<sub>x</sub> active sites into inactive

sites such as metal clusters or metallic nanoparticle, implying that an optimized Fe doping is essential for the formation of active sites. 43,51 Fe-N-C/gCN prepared with 30 mg of g-C<sub>3</sub>-N<sub>4</sub> showed a poor catalytic activity ( $E_0$  of 0.85 V,  $E_{1/2}$  of 0.77 V). Increasing the loading of the material, probably resulted in lowering the accessibility of active sites covered in the carbon layers. Overall, these results demonstrated that the enhanced catalytic activity of Fe-N-C did not only rely on the PPy that offered a stable structure to inhibit the Fe aggregation and accommodated FeN<sub>x</sub> within the micropores, but also relied on different synthesis parameters that cooperatively played a pivotal role.

#### **Conclusions**

A stabilized assisted-method was successfully developed for a facile synthesis of Fe-N-C catalyst on graphitic carbon, using g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> as template and nitrogen source and pyrrole as additional N source. Aggregation of Fe was prevented, to achieve a metal loading of 5.4 wt%. Pyridinic N played a crucial role, assuring the coordination for Fe atom to shape Fe-N-C structure, while the abundance and exposure of FeNx active sites were provided by the hierarchical porous structure of Fe-N-C catalyst. The high metal loading, the well-defined dispersion of Fe and N in the carbon framework and the high proportion of N species have played a considerable role in the enhancement of the catalytic activity of Fe-N-C. Fe-N-C showed a competitive activity with half-wave potential  $E_{1/2}$  of 0.82 V and a better long-time stability than Pt/C. Thus, providing a promising low-cost candidate to substitute Pt/C as a catalyst in fuel cells applications in alkaline media.

**A heterobimetallic corrole complex, comprising oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) active non-precious metals Co and Fe with a corrole-N4 center (PhFCC), is successfully synthesized and used to prepare a dual-atom molecular catalyst (DAMC) through subsequent low-temperature pyrolysis. This low-temperature pyrolyzed electrocatalyst exhibited impressive ORR performance, with onset potentials of 0.86 and 0.94 V, and half-wave potentials of 0.75 and 0.85 V, under acidic and basic conditions, respectively. During potential cycling, this DAMC displayed half-wave potential losses of only 25 and 5 mV under acidic and alkaline conditions after 3000 cycles, respectively, demonstrating its excellent stability. Single-cell Nafion-based proton exchange membrane fuel cell performance using this DAMC as the cathode catalyst showed a maximum power density of 225 mW cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> , almost close to that of most metal–N4 macrocycle-based catalysts. The present study showed that preservation of the defined CoN4 structure along with the cocatalytic Fe–Cx site synergistically acted as a dual ORR active center to boost overall ORR performance. The development of DAMC from a heterobimetallic CoN4 macrocyclic system using low-temperature pyrolysis is also advantageous for practical applications.**

**1. Introduction**

Hydrogen-based proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) are considered clean energy systems with zerocarbon emissions. However, sluggish oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) kinetics at the cathode catalyst layer are a major drawback to their cost-effective commercialization. To date, although platinum-group metal-based catalysts have been recognized as the best-performing ORR electrocatalysts, their future use as cathode catalysts is limited by scarcity and high costs, meaning that alternative economic cathode catalysts are greatly needed.[1] Among tremendous research efforts toward developing non-precious electrocatalysts, transition-metal-based metal–N4 (MN4) macrocyclic compounds have emerged as promising non-platinum group metal electrocatalysts after the pioneering breakthrough of Jasinski in 1964, who reported a cobalt phthalocyaninebased electrocatalyst.[2] Recent studies have reported a broad range of macrocyclic MN4 centers, such as Co and Fecoordinated porphyrins, phthalocyanines, corrins, and corroles, that possess promising non-precious metal active catalytic sites for the ORR.[2–5] A common feature

of these macrocyclic MN4 systems is a single transition metal atom with biomimetic ligands, and with the maintenance of these single-metal-atom MN4 active sites as electrocatalysts being the most important factor in improving the ORR. Therefore, the use of these N4 macrocyclic complexes for developing

MN4 electrocatalysts is owing to the unique nature of their pristine MN4 structures. In the case of N-doped metal catalysts, MN4 active centers are difficult to derive either from N-coordinated metal complexes or N-doped metal salts owing to the lack of pre-existing MN4 moieties.[6–8] In contrast, retaining or preserving MN4 moieties from precursor MN4 macrocyclic compounds is highly desirable to realize the advantageous mechanistic aspects of MN4 ORR active centers. The large plane of the MN4 site with tetrapyrroles in MN4 macrocycles is reported to be exposed for smoother O2 adsorption, in contrast, to arbitrarily N-doped MNx structures, forming less-energetic catalytic transition states to favor the ORR through a direct four-electron pathway.[9–12]

To date, ORR studies on MN4 macrocycles have shown that pyrolyzed MN4 electrocatalysts have better performance and greatly improved stability compared with their non-pyrolyzed states.[13–21] In pyrolyzed MN4 electrocatalysts, precursor MN4 molecules are adsorbed onto the supporting carbon matrix, and later entrenched into the graphitized structures with increasing pyrolysis temperatures, which facilitates better ORR kinetics and stability. Among pyrolyzed electrocatalyst systems, most literature reports have demonstrated that the ORR performance of the electrocatalyst is linked to the annealing temperature. Furthermore, high-temperature annealing clearly boosts the ORR performance of electrocatalysts by facilitating a high graphitic carbon content, which further improves the charge transfer process. In addition to enhanced catalytic performance, different approaches have been suggested to maintain active MN4 site structures at high temperatures, including heteroatom doping into the MN4 electrocatalyst system.[22–26] However, under high-temperature pyrolysis, stabilization of the pre-designed MN4 structure and identification of the catalytic ORR active sites is challenging owing to the formation of various uncontrollable active and inactive catalytic sites, and the actual cause of improved ORR performance remains disputed.[27–30] To overcome the limitation of uncontrollable MN4 structures under high-temperature pyrolysis, processing MN4-macrocycle-based electrocatalysts at low-temperatures is a viable approach.[31–34] At low-temperatures, such as 300–600 °C, relatively moderate graphitization of the electrocatalyst system leads to sluggish electron transport behavior. This problem can be overcome using highly conductive and well-graphitized carbon materials, such as multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), whose delocalized sp2 orbitals can be hybridized with highly-conjugated planar porphyrin and its analogs through strong *π* interactions.[35–40]

Although most reported non-precious catalysts have shown excellent ORR performance in basic media,[41] high-performance ORR activity in acidic media has been exclusively investigated using MN4-centered electrocatalysts obtained from pristine MN4 macrocycles.[18–21,31–34] Recent studies of cobalt and iron-based MN4 macrocycle complexes alone have shown better electrocatalytic ORR performance, with subsequent studies focusing on their homo- and heterobimetallic complexes to maintain both activity and stability.[18–21,42–46] Compared with recently reported bimetallic systems derived from two different metal precursors, a single molecular complex composed of heterobimetals in close proximity, resulting in a synergistic effect, is highly desirable for a facile oxygen reduction mechanism, similar to the natural ORR conducted by cytochrome c oxidase.[47–51]

Lower symmetry structures of MN4 macrocycles, such as corrin and corroles, have been reported to show noteworthy ORR performance compared with symmetric porphyrins and phthalocyanines.[17–20] Furthermore, the effect of heterobimetals, particularly the combination of Co and Fe, along with their presence in a single MN4 macrocycle, can afford the additional advantage of providing both activity and stability.[42–44] In a previous study, we introduced a lower symmetry Co–Fe bimetallic MN4-macrocycle corrole complex (FCC) for ORR to facilitate the synergistic effect of bimetals in lower symmetry MN4 macrocyclic complexes.[21] However, FCC can only be isolated in a very limited amount owing to its low molecular stability during purification. Herein, to develop a duel-atom molecular catalyst (DAMC), we introduced a new analog of FCC with a phenylene bridge linking ferrocene and the 10-meso position of the corrole ring, namely, [(triphenylphosphine)(10-phenylferrocenyl-5,15-diphenyl)corrolato] cobalt(III), denoted hereafter as PhFCC. The chemical structures of PhFCC and FCC are shown in **Figure 1**a. The additional phenylene group in PhFCC led to an extended *π*-conjugated electron system that was beneficial for facile graphitization or graphitic interactions with contiguous *π*-electron-rich carbon supports.[3] Overall, PhFCC gave improved synthetic yields, exhibited better thermal behavior, and possesses localized *π* interactions with a graphitized MWCNT support.

# **2. Results and Discussion**

#### **2.1. Synthesis and Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) of PhFCC**

The complete synthesis procedure for PhFCC is provided in the Supporting Information, and the synthetic route for PhFCC is illustrated in Figure 1b. Briefly, PhFCC was synthesized by the condensation of 4-ferrocenylbenzaldehyde and 5-phenyldipyrromethane under acidic conditions, followed by dehydrogenation with 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-*p*-benzoquinone to give cobalt-free pre-PhFCC. Owing to the ring-constrained structure, pre-PhFCC was immediately converted into the well-stabilized PhFCC complex by coordination with trivalent cobalt. The PhFCC purification process was trouble-free compared with that of our previously reported FCC complex. Furthermore, the yield of PhFCC was triple that of FCC owing to the phenylene group linkage directly attached at the peripheral (10-meso) position of the corrole ring. The phenylene linker with an electron-withdrawing nature at the 10-meso peripheral position in PhFCC provided reduced ring strain in the CoN4 macrocycle and resulted in relatively stable behavior during column chromatography purification. PhFCC was characterized by both <sup>1</sup> H NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry (MS), as shown in Figures S1 and S2, Supporting Information, respectively.

Most MN4 macrocycle-based electrocatalyst systems studied, especially those above 600 °C, produce unclear coordinated structures on a carbon matrix along with uncontrollable metallic phases.[27–29] To overcome the above-unresolved issues and protect the MN4 configurations, non-pyrolyzed catalysts have been studied, but were found to be usually unstable for

the ORR.[15–17] The present study aimed to retain the core CoN4 structure as an active site at moderately low pyrolysis temperatures. Based on TGA, PhFCC possessed a higher thermal stability than FCC, as shown in Figure 1c. Furthermore, the additional attachment of a phenylene group at the 10-meso position of the corrole ring greatly increased the thermal stability of PhFCC compared with that of FCC. In PhFCC, the first and second mass losses occurred in temperature ranges of 350–450 and 450–585 °C, perhaps corresponding to triphenylphosphine and slight peripheral losses, respectively. The subsequent minor drop observed at 585–665 °C might be related to residual organic loss.

Electrocatalysts were prepared by dispersing a carbon support in a homogeneous solution of PhFCC, followed by solvent removal and thermal treatment under moderately low-temperature conditions; further details are provided in the Experimental Section (Supporting Information). The effects of supporting the electrocatalysts on carbon by treatment at 500 °C were initially investigated to compare PhFCC supported on Vulcan XC-72R and MWCNTs, denoted as PhFCC/XC-72R and PhFCC/ MWCNT, respectively. Figures S3a,b, Supporting Information, show X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns and Raman spectra of PhFCC/MWCNT and PhFCC/XC-72R, respectively. The graphitic carbon diffraction peak (002) observed at around 26° (2*θ*) was more intense and sharper in PhFCC/MWCNT than in PhFCC/XC-72R, indicating that MWCNT-supported PhFCC had a remarkably graphitized matrix. The characteristic D and G bands in the Raman spectra also showed the same trend of a higher degree of graphitization in PhFCC/MWCNT than in PhFCC/XC-72R. The greater degree of graphitization observed in PhFCC/MWCNT will result in better electron transport properties. Furthermore, PhFCC possesses greater *π*–*π* interactions with the MWCNT support (either between or onto the walls) during pyrolysis owing to its rich delocalized *π*-electron cloud across the Co-corrole ring via tetrapyrroles and three peripheral aromatic phenyl moieties.[52,53] Accordingly, PhFCC has more stabilized and localized electronic interactions with MWCNTs, which could be highly advantageous for improving the electrochemical ORR kinetics compared with conventional carbon supports. The unique features of PhFCC encouraged us to further investigate MWCNT-supported PhFCC electrocatalysts.

#### **2.2. Characterization of MWCNT-Supported PhFCC Electrocatalysts**

From the TGA of PhFCC, as shown in Figure 1c, various pyrolysis temperatures in the range of 400–700 °C were selected for the development of PhFCC/MWCNT electrocatalysts, with catalysts prepared at 400, 500, 600, and 700 °C denoted as PhFCC-400, PhFCC-500, PhFCC-600, and PhFCC-700, respectively. Powder XRD analysis was used to identify the phase and structure of the as-synthesized electrocatalysts, with the results shown in **Figure 2**. The catalysts showed different phase formation trends with increasing pyrolysis temperature. A new intermediate phase appeared at moderately low-temperatures (400–500 °C), while metallic phases were observed at temperatures of 600 °C and above. In the long XRD scan from 4–9°, a characteristic lower angle peak was observed for PhFCC-400 and PhFCC-500 catalysts at a 2*θ* value of 5.8°, as shown in Figures 2a,b. This lower angle diffraction peak might correspond to the formation of small covalent assemblies of PhFCC molecules during low-temperature pyrolysis (400–500 °C).[54–56] However, this lower angle diffraction peak was neither found in the pristine samples nor in catalysts pyrolyzed at higher temperatures. Graphitic diffraction peaks at 2*θ* values of 26°, 42.8°,

and 44.5° were attributed to the (002), (100), and (101) reflections of MWCNT, respectively, in all catalysts. Furthermore, additional small diffraction peaks at 43.9° and 45.0° observed in PhFCC-600 and PhFCC-700, might correspond to the presence of cobalt/iron metallic phases,[57–60] which were absent in catalysts obtained below 500 °C (PhFCC-400 and PhFCC-500; Figures 2a,c). Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy was also used to analyze the pyrolyzed catalysts, with the results shown in Figure S4, Supporting Information. Characteristic Co–N bonding for the Co–N4 corrole vibrational mode at around 1034 cm−<sup>1</sup> in pristine PhFCC was also observed in PhFCC-400 and PhFCC-500, while most of the remaining vibrational modes of PhFCC were retained in all catalysts.[15,61,62] The XRD and FT-IR results clearly showed that DAMCs derived from low-temperature pyrolysis possessed unique properties and preserved key features of the CoN4 structure, which acts as an active site for electrochemical ORR.[31–34] The Raman spectra of the as-prepared electrocatalysts showed D, G, and 2D bands without any additional variations (Figure S5, Supporting Information).

# **2.3. Electrochemical Studies**

The electrocatalytic ORR activity of the as-prepared catalysts was studied using a rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE) in an acidic medium (0.1 M HClO4) with a Pt ring and glassy carbon as the working electrodes. The RRDE has a double working electrode system in which the disk electrode is used to obtain the ORR polarization curves and the ring working electrode is used to quantify the H2O2 yield through its oxidation. Possible electrode reactions occurring at the disk electrode are presented in the SI. Figure S6 shows the comparative ORR polarization curves of PhFCC/MWCNT and PhFCC/XC-72R. The polarization curve of PhFCC/MWCNT exhibited a significant half-wave potential (*E*1/2) shift of more than 100 mV compared with that of PhFCC/XC-72R. The improved behavior of as-synthesized PhFCC/MWCNT electrocatalyst clearly demonstrated its unique character, which is due to the high graphitic effect and non-covalent *π*–*π* interactions, as explained earlier. Furthermore, to understand the synergistic effect of the two fused Cocoordinated and Fe-coordinated moieties in PhFCC, the ORRs of Co-corrole and ferrocene separately supported on MWCNT were investigated and compared with that of PhFCC, as shown in Figure S7, Supporting Information. The ORR curves based on linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) measurements of PhFCC/ MWCNT showed superior ORR kinetic performance compared with Co-corrole/MWCNT and ferrocene/MWCNT. This suggested that the proximate presence of both Co-corrole and ferrocene in a single molecule of PhFCC was key to the improved ORR performance of PhFCC/MWCNT as a DAMC. Meanwhile, the effect of the phenylene group linker at the 10-meso position in PhFCC also played a pivotal role in enhancing ORR polarization compared with that of FCC. Furthermore, pristine MWCNTs showed inactive ORR performance, indicating no cross-activity from MWCNTs in all MWCNT-supported catalysts examined in this study (Figure S7, Supporting Information).

The electrocatalytic activities of MWCNT-supported PhFCC catalysts obtained at different pyrolysis temperatures toward the ORR were also investigated. **Figure 3**a shows the comparative

ORR LSV current density curves of PhFCC-400, PhFCC-500, PhFCC-600, PhFCC-700, and 20% Pt/C in an acidic medium. PhFCC-400 showed better activity, with an onset potential of 0.86 V and  $E_{1/2}$  of 0.75 V, which were close to those of the commercial Pt/C catalyst. In contrast, PhFCC-600 and PhFCC-700 exhibited lower activity, with  $E_{1/2}$  values of 0.67 and 0.64 V, respectively, while PhFCC-500 showed slight ORR degradation, with an  $E_{1/2}$  value negatively shifted by 15 mV compared with that of PhFCC-400. Furthermore, Figure 3b shows that PhFCC-400. PhFCC-500, and PhFCC-600 had similar oxidative curves and exhibited low ring currents compared with PhFCC-700, indicating less H2O2 formation by the low-temperature pyrolyzed electrocatalysts. As shown in Figure 3c and summarized in Table S1, Supporting Information, the DAMC (specifically PhFCC-400, with these two terms used interchangeably hereafter) exhibited an average electron transfer number (n value) of around 3.96 and a low H2O2 yield of below 2.3%. This indicated that PhFCC-400 follows a direct four-electron pathway toward pure water production. PhFCC-500 and PhFCC-600 had slightly smaller n values and H2O2 yields compared with PhFCC-400, while PhFCC-700 had a poor n value and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> yield, likely due to increased metallic phase formation under pyrolysis.<sup>[63]</sup> However, PhFCC-400 possessed a negative  $E_{1/2}$  shift of 40 mV, with slightly higher diffusion limiting currents, and exhibited similar n values compared with the 20% Pt/C catalyst. The observed limiting current densities of PhFCC-400 were larger than those of all catalysts compared in Figure 3a, indicating that the charge transport properties of PhFCC-400 were improved due to facile electron exchange between the preserved CoN4 structure and

MWCNTs. To further substantiate the improved conductivity of the PhFCC-400 catalyst, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed at 0.7 V. The Nyquist plots in Figure 3d show the EIS results of pristine MWCNT, PhFCC-400, PhFCC-500, PhFCC-600, and PhFCC-700, confirming interfacial charge transfer at the catalyst-electrolyte interface. Among them, the small-diameter semicircle observed for PhFCC-400 corresponded to low charge transfer resistance, showing that charge transfer was faster in PhFCC-400. The faster charge transfer kinetics observed in PhFCC-400 was due to the high graphitic  $\pi$ – $\pi$  stacking interactions between the conserved CoN4 and MWCNTs. Although PhFCC-500 showed a slightly higher charge transfer resistance than PhFCC-400, both possessed much lower resistance and improved charge exchange compared with PhFCC-600 and PhFCC-700. The higher charge transfer resistance of PhFCC-600 and PhFCC-700 demonstrated their poor charge transport kinetics for the ORR process. These results were also in complete accordance with the ORR performance curves shown in Figure 3a. A comparison of this work with reported bimetallic MN4 macrocycle catalysts in acidic media is shown in Table S2, Supporting Information. The DAMC exhibited as one of the best catalysts for the ORR regarding the overpotential and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> yield. This is the first report of a DAMC with both Co and Fe metals present in the same molecule with preserved MN4 electrocatalytic sites that shows significantly enhanced ORR performance.

Stability measurements of DAMC, as shown in Figure 3e, displayed a small drop of only 25 mV after 3000 continuous potential cycles, which was almost comparable to most of the

reported MN4-macrocycle-based non-precious catalysts in acidic media (Table S2, Supporting Information). Furthermore, chronoamperometric measurements under limiting current potentials showed catalyst stability for up to 10 h with 75.5% retention for PhFCC-400, which was superior to the current drop (60.3%) observed for the Pt/C catalyst (inset in Figure 3e). Similar high current drops were also observed for commercial Pt/C catalysts in other reports, which are due to carbon corrosion, dissolution, and migration of platinum particles.[64–66] We further exploited the DAMC as a cathode material for PEMFCs. Interestingly, a single-cell PEMFC performance test showed a maximum peak power density of 225 mW cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> (Figure 3f), which is an acceptable figure for MN4-macrocycle-based catalysts (Figure S8, Supporting Information), and similar to those of other published Co–corrole analogs.[19] Although the maximum power density value of the DAMC was slightly low compared with those of most reported non-precious metal– N*x* electrocatalysts, as shown in Figure S8, Supporting Information, we believe further improvements can be achieved by additional investigational studies. Furthermore, the single-cell durability of various MN4-based electrocatalysts is shown in Table S3, Supporting Information. Although most ORR studies of non-pyrolyzed molecular catalysts do not provide half-cell stability data, the half-cell activity and stability performance of our DAMC was much better than those of other reported nonpyrolyzed catalysts, and comparable to those of most high-temperature pyrolyzed MN4 catalysts (Table S2, Supporting Information). With appropriate optimization and in-depth study, we believe that low-temperature pyrolyzed catalysts such as the DAMC in this study could fill the gap between non-pyrolyzed and high-temperature pyrolyzed electrocatalysts.

To check the dynamic function of the as-prepared electrocatalysts in basic media for hydroxyl anion exchange membrane fuel cell (AEMFC) applications, the rotating disk electrode (RDE) technique was performed using 0.1 M KOH electrolyte solution. We observed fascinating improvements in ORR kinetics, especially at temperatures below 600 °C, similar to the results in acidic media. As shown in **Figure 4**a, the RDE LSV curve of synthesized PhFCC-400 exhibited an onset potential of 0.94 V and an *E*1/2 value of 0.85 V, representing a significant positive shift compared with PhFCC-700. The *E*1/2 value was also shifted 5 mV higher compared with that of PhFCC-500 and 15 mV higher compared with that of PhFCC-600. We observed that the *E*1/2 values and onset potentials of PhFCC-400 and PhFCC-500 were similar, but the former had slightly higher limiting currents. The DAMC had an *E*1/2 potential of just 20 mV lower than that of commercial 20% Pt/C, while the onset potential was lowered by only 40 mV. Overall, the DAMC showed higher activity than its counterpart catalysts. The Koutecky–Levich (K–L) method was used to estimate the n value for DAMC in an alkaline medium. The parallel and linear K–L plots of DAMC at various potentials (0.45–0.7 V) followed firstorder reaction kinetics for the ORR and exhibited an almost four-electron transfer pathway, with an n value of around 3.94 (Figure 4b). Regarding durability, the PhFCC-400 catalyst exhibited potentially stable behavior, with the *E*1/2 potential showing a

mere 5 mV loss after 3000 continuous potential cycle measurements (Figure 4c). Furthermore, chronoamperometry for up to 10 h showed that PhFCC-400, with 92.9% retention, was more durable than Pt/C catalyst (83.6%) under alkaline conditions (inset in Figure 4c). The methanol crossover resistance of a catalyst is also important for AEMFC commercial applications. Various types of Pt/C catalysts cause a sharp jump in current density through methanol oxidation.[7] Therefore, we performed a methanol crossover study of DAMC, as shown in Figure 4d. Interestingly, the results showed excellent methanol tolerance, indicating that DAMC is also a potential alternative to replace Pt-based catalysts in alkaline media. Comparison of the ORR data from this work with those from other reported literature in alkaline media, as shown in Table S4, Supporting Information, showed that the DAMC had comparable *E*1/2 values to reported bimetallic MN4 macrocycle catalysts and exhibited a better fourelectron transfer pathway.

The ORR results observed in the alkaline medium were similar to those observed in the acidic medium above. This showed that the catalysts formed at low-temperatures of 500 °C and below displayed dual ORR behavior in both acidic and basic media for utilization as cathode materials in PEMFC and AEMFC/metal–air battery applications, respectively. These characteristic observations are likely due to the sufficient thermal stability of PhFCC to retain the core CoN4 structure, a well-known non-precious catalytic active center. Notably, the entrenched synergistic effect of Co and Fe atoms separated by atomic distances, especially owing to their non-collapsible behavior at reasonably low pyrolysis temperatures, resulted in weakening of the OO covalent bond by simultaneous support of both metal-sites involved in the rapid ORR mechanism, ultimately facilitating faster ORR kinetics. Low-temperature heat treatment was also sufficient to embed these metal-sites into/ onto graphitic matrices owing to the highly sp2 -hybridized conductive MWCNT support. Further detailed characterization of the active catalyst was conducted using various techniques, as described below.

Electrochemical double-layer capacitance (*C*dl) is used to estimate the electroactive surface area (ESA) of a material, as these properties are linearly proportional. Cyclic voltammetry measurements in non-Faradaic regions and the corresponding linear fitting graphs are shown in Figures S9–S11, Supporting Information. PhFCC-400 showed a larger double-layer capacitance than PhFCC-600 and pristine MWCNTs, at almost 1.35 and 10 times higher, respectively, in both acidic and basic media, indicating a larger relative ESA. This suggested that more effective active sites were exposed in PhFCC-400, which was ultimately responsible for its better ORR activity. In contrast, with increasing pyrolysis temperature, as metallic phases become prominent at 600 °C and above, the surface pores can be blocked, resulting in a decreased ESA. **Figure 5**a shows the morphology of the PhFCC-400 catalyst obtained by scanning

High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) images of PhFCC-400, as shown in Figures 5b,c, clearly showed that 5–15 nm nanoparticles were embedded into the MWCNTs. Similarly, tiny 1–2 nm particles were widely found to be deeply rooted into the nanotubes, as shown by the high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) image (Figure 5d). The uniform and adjoining distribution of N, Co, and Fe elements on the MWCNTs indicated that in-built connectivity between CoN4 and Fe-centers was withheld, as shown in Figures 5e–h, implying the coexistence of both Co and Fe metal centers, resulting in atomic clusters.

The elemental composition and oxidation states of DAMC were investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The XPS spectra of N 1s, Co 2p3/2, and Fe 2p3/2 for pristine PhFCC and PhFCC-400 were fitted, deconvoluted, and compared to determine the presence of original active sites as surface constituents, as shown in **Figure 6**. The N-bonded coordination in the pristine PhFCC molecular structure, as depicted in Figure 1a, was comprised of one N→Co dative bond, and three N–Co and eight pyrrolic N–C covalent bonds in a 1:3:8 ratio. This proportion was virtually comparable to the area under the deconvoluted curves fitted for the N 1s XPS spectrum of pristine PhFCC, as shown in Figure 6a. In Figure 6a, the N 1s spectrum shows three specific deconvoluted peaks at binding energies of around 398.5, 399.6, and 400.7 eV, confirming the presence of pyrrolic N–C, N–Co bonding, and N→Co dative bonds, denoted as N1, N2, and N4 respectively.[67–69] The highest deconvoluted peak (N1), representing pyrrolic macrocycle-N4 N-bonding in pristine PhFCC, was determined to be a typical signature of the CoN4 structure.[27] This bonding structure was clearly retained in PhFCC-400, with a slight upward shift of less than 0.3 eV (Figure 6d). A clear hump projected at about 400.2 eV (N3) in PhFCC-400 represented a slight change in N– Co coordination without loss of the bonding signature, which lay between the deconvoluted N2 and N4 N–Co bonding peaks of pristine PhFCC. This N3 deconvoluted peak, signifying stimulated ORR-active CoN4 centers, was due to rearrangement of the original N2 and N4 coordinating sites during low-temperature treatment at 400 °C. Furthermore, broadening beyond 401 up to 403 eV produced two additional deconvoluted peaks at 401.3 (N5) and 402.5 eV (N6), attributed to quaternary-N and charge localization in heterocycle compounds, respectively.[70]

The Co 2p3/2 spectra of pristine PhFCC and PhFCC-400 are shown in Figures 6b,e, respectively. The pristine PhFCC peak was deconvoluted into two fitting peaks, with that at 782.0 eV assigned to Co–P bonding. The second peak with the highest intensity at about 780 eV represented the corrole ring of the CoN4 structure. Under low-temperature pyrolysis, slight structural rearrangement of PhFCC is possible, with maintenance of the covalent bonding properties. Therefore, a broadening along with a few humps were observed in PhFCC-400, with the Co 2p3/2 spectrum accommodated by six deconvoluted fitting curves accordingly. The CoN4 structure binding energy region (780.0 eV) observed in the pristine sample was retained in PhFCC-400. Furthermore, this region in PhFCC-400 showed a broadening in association with two fitting deconvoluted peaks at 780.9 and 779.7 eV, corresponding to two forms of the CoN4 system with a trivial change in ring structure orientation,[27,39] and similar kinds of two MN4 sites were previously observed by

Kramm et al.[71] The fitting zone of 782–784 eV for PhFCC-400 represented mixed forms of Co–Nx structures, with the deconvoluted peak at 784.5 eV as its satellite peak.[72–74] The slight hump at a lower binding energy of 777.9 eV might be due to spatial interaction of the CoN4 centers with neighboring Fesites.[75] Interestingly, the lack of P 2p peak in the XPS spectrum of PhFCC-400 (Figure S12, Supporting Information) showed that the originally present fifth axial coordination (Co–P bond), namely, the triphenylphosphine ligand, had detached. Consequently, PhFCC-400 produces a four-coordinated CoN4 structure on which a facile oxygen reduction mechanism spontaneously occurs from both faces of the CoN4 plane.

The Fe 2p3/2 spectra of pristine PhFCC and PhFCC-400, as shown in Figures 6c,f, respectively, show a significant peak shift of the ferrocene Fe2+ state (707.6 eV) in PhFCC to the Fe3+ state of the ferrocene-derived Fe-center in PhFCC-400 (711.3 eV). The presence of a Fe3+ species originating from the ferrocene moieties might be due to the appearance of ferrocenium derivative species or Fe–Cx moieties by encompassing carbon network of cyclopentadienly bonding.[68,76–78] The observed deconvoluted peak at a higher binding energy of 714.0 eV was attributed to the Fe3+ satellite. The absence of peaks at around 707.0 eV demonstrated that iron carbides, such as Fe3C/Fe5C2, were not present, implying no cross-confusion with the observed Fe–Cx structures.[79,80] Furthermore, the absence of metallic-Fe and metallic-Co peaks from the respective Fe 2p3/2 and Co 2p3/2 spectra, clearly supporting the previous XRD results, which was due to the low-temperature pyrolysis.[81] We believe that the observed enhanced ORR performance of the DAMC might be due to simultaneous utilization of the CoN4 center supported by Fe–Cx sites through superficial elementary reaction steps.[45,82,83]

To obtain detailed insight into the electronic structure, oxidation states, and electron density of Co and Fe centers in the PhFCC-400 electrocatalyst, Co and Fe K-edge X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) were recorded. To better understand the active structure of the PhFCC-400 electrocatalyst, comparative spectroscopic studies were performed on pristine PhFCC, PhFCC-600, and Co/Fe-foils, as shown in **Figure 7**. From Figure 7a, the Co K-edge XANES spectra of PhFCC-400 from pre-edge to white line region significantly matched that of pristine PhFCC, indicating complete association of the original CoN4 structural features. The shift in absorption edge (E0) position is used to determine the valence states of elements, with a higher value of E0 corresponding to a higher oxidation state for a particular element. This is due to core level electrons becoming more tightly bound in higher valence states than in lower states, resulting in higher energy of absorption being required for ejection.

The *E*0 value (7720.5 eV) in the Co K-edge spectrum of PhFCC-400 confirmed that it remained in Co3+ state, similar to that for the pristine PhFCC, which implied that the original valence characteristics at the CoN4-center were unchanged (Figure 7a). In contrast, the K-edge spectrum of PhFCC-600 was closely associated with that of Co-foil, with both presenting the same E0 energy of 7710.1 eV, representing the zero valence state and indicating metallic phase formation. Furthermore, the Fe K-edge XANES spectra (Figure 7b) showed that the E0

value of pristine PhFCC (7119.8 eV) corresponding to ferrocene Fe2<sup>+</sup> state was positively shifted by around 4.0 eV in PhFCC-400, indicating the appearance of Fe<sup>3</sup><sup>+</sup> valence states, which was consistent with Fe 2p XPS results. However, both pristine PhFCC and PhFCC-400 had similar spectral features in the region immediately beyond the absorption edge energies, suggesting that PhFCC-400 retained the original Fe–C bonding features resembling the Fe–Cx structures. This might be due to slight geometrical changes occurring at the ferrocenic-Fe center, which is generally anticipated at low pyrolysis temperatures. In contrast, the K-edge properties of PhFCC-600 were similar to that of the reference Fe-foil, with similar E0 values of 7113.2 and 7112 eV, respectively. This indicated a zero oxidation state for the catalyst developed at 600 °C, which supported the XRD result. Figure 7c shows a comparison of Co K-edge extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) fitting spectra, with pristine PhFCC exhibiting a broadened peak at around 1.50 Å, suggesting the average Co–N radial distance of the CoN4 ring. The same bonding behavior was reflected by the appearance of twin peaks at 1.46 and 1.70 Å in PhFCC-400. This implied that PhFCC-400 had two forms of rearranged CoN4 structural orientations, as also consistently shown by the Co 2p3/2 XPS spectrum. However, despite PhFCC-600 having comparable radial distance peaks to those of PhFCC-400, it contained an additional peak at 2.3 Å for metal–metal distances, such as Co–Fe or Co–Co. This indicated that PhFCC-400 retained the complete CoN4 structure, while PhFCC-600 had a mixed bonding nature along with a significant amount of metallic phases, as supported by the aforementioned XANES and XRD results. In catalyst PhFCC-400, it is attributed that the Co–corrole ring rearranged to slightly switched CoN4 structures without any damage.[31–34,71] The Fe K-edge EXAFS fitting results in Figure 7d showed that the radial distance of 2.15 Å for PhFCC-600 was clearly associated with Fe-foil (2.17 Å), indicating an obvious metallic phase formation. Meanwhile, at low pyrolysis temperatures, the bond distance of 1.4 Å for PhFCC-400 corresponding to Fe–C reflected that of pristine PhFCC (1.5 Å). These results showed that the Fe–C bonding signature of ferrocene in pristine PhFCC was intact in low-temperature pyrolysis catalysts in Fe–Cx forms, but was unlikely in electrocatalysts derived at 600 °C (PhFCC-600) and above, for which metallic phase formation was prominent. The existence of a strong *π*-electron cloud across the corrole ring preserved the CoN4 structure in PhFCC-400 and aided strong *π*–*π* electronic coupling with the sp2 -rich MWCNT carbon support which ultimately induced the facile electron transportation pathway. In contrast, such electron passage is inhibited in PhFCC-600 by deformation of the Co–corrole structure and presence of metallic phases. This is consistent with the hypothesis of this study that ORR-active species gradually decrease and inactive species increase with increasing pyrolysis temperatures. This X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) showed that the prepared DAMC possessed a dual Co and Fe atom-based molecular system with a distinct electronic structure, which shows high potential for the electrochemical ORR.

The elemental compositions of the as-prepared catalysts were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma-MS (ICP-MS) and CHN elemental analysis (EA), with the results shown in Table S5, Supporting Information. The ICP-MS results indicated that nearly equal weight percentages of Fe and Co were observed in the respective catalysts. EA data showed that the N content (wt%) of PhFCC was the same as that of PhFCC-400 and PhFCC-500, but had nearly decreased by half in PhFCC-600 and PhFCC-700. This decreased nitrogen concentration might be due to N–Co bonds being broken to form metallic phases. In contrast, the N contents in low-temperature pyrolyzed catalysts, such as PhFCC-400 and PhFCC-500, were comparable to that of pristine PhFCC without any significant loss. This information provides further evidence for the CoN4 structure remaining intact at low pyrolysis temperatures. Overall, the results showed that the low-temperature pyrolyzed electrocatalysts originating from precursor MN4-macrocyle molecules have preserved MN4 active centers. Accordingly, a key strategy is to achieve facile electron transportation through *π*–*π* interaction, covalent functionalization, or other alternative models. We believe that, once a well-controllable methodology has been developed, the roadmap for non-precious electrocatalysts will progress closer to commercialization. Furthermore, the low-temperature pyrolysis approach toward macrocycle-N4 corrole complex and dual-metal-atom-based non-precious molecular electrocatalysts is economically feasible for commercial implementation to further reduce the cost of fuel cells.

# **3. Conclusions**

A heterobinuclear corrole macrocycle complex of Co and Fe (PhFCC) was successfully synthesized in high yield for fuel cell applications. The high thermal stability of as-synthesized PhFCC and its notable *π*-stacking interaction with MWCNT to form a composite electrocatalyst at low pyrolysis temperatures facilitated superior ORR performance. The key feature was formation of the DAMC, in which the active CoN4 ORR site and the nearby Fe–Cx dual metal atom center operate synergistically to enhance ORR performance. The DAMC selectively followed a four-electron water-production pathway and the ORR electrochemical stability showed only a slight loss after 3000 potential cycles in both acidic and basic media. The PEMFC performance of the DAMC using a Nafion membrane showed an impressive power density of around 225 mW cm<sup>−</sup>2 in a single cell. Furthermore, XAS and XPS studies suggested complete preservation of the CoN4 active center at a low pyrolysis temperature of 400 °C. We believe that this DAMC based on a nonprecious MN4 electrocatalyst and obtained by low-temperature pyrolysis could provide a promising approach to the development of highly efficient ORR electrocatalysts with further study.

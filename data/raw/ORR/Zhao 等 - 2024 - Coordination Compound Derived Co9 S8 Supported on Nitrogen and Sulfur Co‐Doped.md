Cobalt sulfide, a class of metal chalcogenide with tunable electronic structure and component distribution, has attracted considerable interest in renewable energy conversion and utilization. In this work, we report a facile, efficient and scalable method to synthesize Co<sub>9</sub>S<sub>8</sub> supported on nitrogen and sulfur co doped porous carbon (Co<sub>9</sub>S<sub>8</sub>/N,S-PC) hybrid from the annealing treatment of a coordination compound assembled by 2-mercaptobenzimidazole, 4,4-bipyridine and cobalt salt. The heteroatom of organic ligand could efficiently tune the electronic properties of Co<sub>9</sub>S<sub>8</sub> nanoparticles and well-designed carbon. Meanwhile the interaction of organic ligands provides a platform for the high dispersion of Co<sub>9</sub>S<sub>8</sub>. Owing to the synergetic effect, the Co<sub>9</sub>S<sub>8</sub>/N,S-PC catalyst shows an admirable oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity with the E<sub>1/2</sub> of 0.804 V vs. RHE, together with good durability, and tolerance to methanol poisoning in alkaline media.

## Introduction

The growing energy demand during recent years stems from the improvements in economic growth and our living standards. Therefore, energy conversion and storage technologies that would possibly offer us clean and sustainable energy to meet our energy demands have been one of the most attractive research fields.[1] Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is regarded as the rate-determining step in the field of energy conversion such as proton exchange membrane fuel cells and metal-air batteries because of the kinetically retarded four-electron process. Catalysts have to be used due to complex and sluggish reaction kinetics. [2,3] Traditionally, Pt-based catalysts towards ORR are now being commercialized in many industries, however the resource starvation, high price and poor stability of Pt prevent them from being widely applied to practical application.[4,5]

To overcome the weaknesses of Pt based catalysts, transition metal contained carbon-based materials, cobalt active species (such as cobalt oxide, [6,7] cobalt nitride [8,9] cobalt  $phosphide^{[10-13]} \ and \ cobalt \ sulfide^{[14-17]}) \ electrocatalysts \ have$ been studied and reported. Recently, cobalt sulfides, with

tunable electronic structure and component distribution, especially Co<sub>9</sub>S<sub>8</sub>, were predicted to have a similar electrocatalytic activity to that of Pt electrocatalyst toward the four electron ORR process.[18-21] However, it is difficult for cobalt sulfides catalyst itself to exhibit a sufficient catalytic activity because of its aggregation, low specific surface area and poor conductivity. Previous studies have shown that loading cobalt sulfides onto the conductive carbon such as porous carbon and graphene to form a hybrid can solve this problem effectively. [22,23] Furthermore, heteroatom doping of carbon materials with N and S, can enhance their electrocatalytic properties, [24,25] which are attributed to the charge polarization and asymmetrical electron spin density because of the differences in electronegativity and electron spin density between carbon and heteroatoms.[26-29]

However, it is still a challenge to synthesize highly active cobalt sulfide nanoparticles supported by a well-developed heteroatom-doped porous carbon with hierarchical pore structure by a facile and less expensive method. In general, additional source of nitrogen and sulfur in the preparation of carbon with nitrogen-doped supported cobalt sulfides is needed.[30,31] Such approach includes a complex preparation process and it difficult to control the doping sites of nitrogen on the resulting composite catalyst. In this respect utilization of S, N-containing chemical with a fixed S, N atomic ratio as precursor should be an effective means to fabricate high performance carbon-based cobalt sulfide with a precisely controlled N doping in the carbon structure, and with this strategy can also enhance the interaction between carbon carrier and cobalt sulfide.

Here, we report a facile, efficient and scalable synthesis of Co<sub>9</sub>S<sub>8</sub>/N,S-PC via the thermal treatment after self-assembled aggregate containing 2-mercaptobenzimidazole, 4,4-bipyridine and cobalt source. The synthetic route as shown in Figure 1. The active hydrogen of 2-mercaptobenzimidazole coordinate

with cobalt ion, and then 4,4-bypyridine as a bridge to link them as a lamellar structure, after pyrolysis Co9S8 nanoparticles were loaded on the sheet of doped carbon uniformly. Due to the synergetic effect between Co9S8 nanoparticles and welldesigned carbon support, the composite shows high ORR catalytic activity in alkaline electrolyte.

## **Results and Discussion**

Figure 2(a) is the transmission electron microscope (TEM) image of the coordination compound with CoSO4 as the chemical precursor. There are a lot of network structures in the precursor. The granular Co9S8 was formed after pyrolysis, which is uniformly dispersed on nitrogen and sulfur co doped porous carbon, as shown in Figure 2(b). As displayed in Figure 2(c), the particle size distribution of nanoparticles is narrow mainly concentrated in 8–14 nm and the average particle size is 10.5� 0.2 nm, which fully indicates that Co9S8 nanoparticles are small in size and highly dispersed. The high-resolution analysis of the composite catalyst is shown in Figure 2(d). The interplanar spacing is 0.29 nm, which is consistent with the interplanar spacing of the Co9S8 composite catalyst (311) crystal plane.[32,33] This also fully proves that Co9S8/N,S-PC composite catalyst was prepared by using CoSO4 as the chemical precursor. Elemental analysis of the sample shows that the atomic ratio of Co and S in the composite catalyst is 1.28 (Figure 2(e)), which is close to the atomic ratio of Co9S8, that is consistent with the XRD analysis of the composite catalyst. Figure 2(f) shows the XRD of Co9S8/N,S-PC. The XRD peaks of the catalyst with cobalt sulfate as precursors can be indexed to the pure orthorhombic Co9S8 phase (JCPDS no. 65–6801) without any other impurities. The three diffraction peaks at 29.83°, 47.58° and 52.07° correspond to (311), (511) and (440) planes of face-centered cubic (fcc) Co9S8. This is consistent with the calculated results in the literature.[34,35]

In order to further analyze the structure of the Co9S8/N,S-PC composite catalyst, Raman and Fourier Infrared Spectrometer (FT-IR) analysis are carried out on the composite catalysts. As illustrated in Figure 3(a), the Raman spectrum is divided into two parts, less than 1000 cm <sup>1</sup> and greater than 1000 cm <sup>1</sup> , and the peaks less than 1000 cm <sup>1</sup> are mainly inorganic peaks. In the yellow region, the peaks of 677 cm <sup>1</sup> , 510 cm <sup>1</sup> and 469 cm <sup>1</sup> are corresponding to Co9S8 respectively.[36,37] The peaks at 1350 cm <sup>1</sup> and 1580 cm <sup>1</sup> correspond to the D peak and G peak in carbon materials, and the ratio of ID to IG is an important indicator to characterize the degree of defects in carbon materials.[38] Combined with the calculation results in Table S1, the ID/IG of the prepared Co9S8 composite catalysts are basically the same, which is mainly due to the selection of the same organic ligands. The defect degree of S4-CoSO4 is 0.9939, which is little smaller than other sample, indicating that the catalysts have high degree of graphitization. As shown in Figure 3(b), the C C stretching vibration peak appears at 3124 cm <sup>1</sup> in the composite catalyst, while the stretching vibration peak of carbon and nitrogen corresponds to the carbon-nitrogen stretching vibration peak at 1401.3 cm <sup>1</sup> . It can be seen that there are still C N bonds in the composite catalyst after pyrolysis, and the doping of N in the carbon support can promote the oxygen reduction of the composite catalyst. The surface area and pore size distributions were investigated by adsorption-desorption isotherms of N2. As illustrated in Figure 3(c) and (d), the adsorbed volume has a rapid increase at relatively low pressure (P/P0 =0–0.01) indicates the existence of abundant micropores, and the pore size distribution of S4- CoSO4 is concentrated 1.7 nm, and the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of S1-Co(NO3)2, S2-Co(AC)2, S3-CoCl2 and S4- CoSO4 were 11.81, 55.57, 121.67 and 210.33 m2 g <sup>1</sup> respectively.

Due to the stronger electrophilicity of nitrate, 2-mercaptobenzimidazole cannot form stable complexes with cobalt ions, resulting in a relatively small amount of carbon materials in the composite catalyst. The large specific surface area and micropores exposing more catalytic active sites contained in the materials, and improving the probability of their contact with O2, thus improving the ORR performance of S4-CoSO4.

XPS can accurately determine the existence form of each element in the composite catalyst. As shown in Figure 4(a), the predominant peaks centered at around 284.8 eV refer to the C 1s. The peaks of N 1s and O 1s locate at around 398 eV and 530 eV, respectively. The peaks of Co 2p and S 2p are also observed at around 780 eV and 161 eV, respectively, which confirms that the elements of the Co9S8 composite catalyst. Figure 4 (b) present the Co 2p XPS spectra, where two shake up satellites peaks can be observed. The binding energy located at 779.9 eV in Co 2p3/2 corresponding to the spin orbit characteristic of Co<sup>3</sup><sup>+</sup>, while 796.8 eV in Co 2p1/2 is assigned to Co2<sup>+</sup>, suggesting the mixed valences of Co27. The binding energy located at 781.1 eV corresponds to Co S.[39–41] The two dominant peaks observed in the N1s spectrum at 398.5 and 401.1 eV (Figure 4(c)) can be assigned to the pyridinic and graphitic nitrogen, respectively. These two nitrogen functionalities can be viewed in this case as n-type carbon dopants that lead to the formation of disordered carbon nanostructures. They donate electrons to the carbon, potentially facilitating the ORR.[42] Figure 4(d) shows the S 2p spectra, the peaks located at 161.7 and 163.3 eV are assigned to S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2 of Co9S8, respectively. The peaks at 164.1 and 167. 7 eV are due to C S and SO4 2 .

To investigate the ORR performance of the catalysts with different chemical precursors and Pt/C, the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) polarization cures shown in Figure 5(a) were recorded in oxygen-saturated 0.1 M KOH solution with a rotating disk electrode at 1600 rpm. The onset potential (Eonset),

half-wave potential (E1/2), the kinetic current density at 0.7 V (Jk@0.7 V) and the tafel slope of the composite catalyst are listed in Table 1. The onset potential and half-wave potential are important indicators of the oxygen reduction performance of the composite catalyst. The onset potentials (Eonset) were determined at the current density of 0.1 mAcm <sup>2</sup> . According to Table 1, it can be seen that the oxygen reduction activity of the composite catalyst prepared with different chemical precursors is S4-CoSO4 *>*S3-CoCl2 *>*S2-Co(AC)2 *>*S1-Co(NO3)2. The halfwave potential of the catalyst with CoSO4 as the chemical precursor was 0.804 V (vs. RHE), which was slightly lower to Pt/ C (0.817 V (vs. RHE)), indicating that S4-CoSO4 has excellent ORR

performance comparable to commercial Pt/C. As illustrate in Figure S1, the S4-CoSO4 also show the best activity for ORR in 0.1 M HClO4 solution.

The Tafel slope formula is suitable for areas with high current density. In the oxygen reduction reaction, the speed of the reaction on the surface of the composite catalyst can be judged directly according to the size of the Tafel slope. Compare the tower of the composite catalyst in Figure 5(b). It can be seen from the Tafel slope of S4-CoSO4 that the Tafel slope of S4-CoSO4 is the lowest, which is nearly 15 mVdec 1 lower than that of commercial platinum carbon. Figure 5(c) shows the kinetic current density of the catalyst at 0.7 V. When CoSO4 is used as the chemical reaction precursor, the kinetic current density of the composite catalyst reaches 4.305 mAcm <sup>2</sup> , which is closest to commercial Pt/C. The electron transfer numbers of different composite catalysts were calculated at 0.4 V, and the results are shown in Figure 5(d). The numbers of transferred electrons are 2.93, 3.59, 3.61, and 3.78, respectively. It is further proved that the oxygen reduction performance of the S4-CoSO4 composite catalyst is the most excellent. In order to calculate the K L equations at different voltages according to the LSV spectra of the S4-CoSO4 composite catalyst at different rotational speeds (Figure 5(e)), in the voltage range of 0.2 V~0.6 V, the number of transferred electrons of the composite catalyst is 3.59, 3.67, 3.78, 3.85, and 3.89 are all close to 4, which indicates that the oxygen reduction process of the Co9S8/N,S-PC composite catalyst prepared with CoSO4 as the reaction precursor is a 4-electron transfer process.

The effect of reaction temperature on electrocatalytic performance of the composite catalyst was studied. Under the protection of nitrogen, composite catalysts with cobalt sulfate as chemical precursor were prepared at different heat treatment temperatures of 500°C, 600°C, 700°Cand 800 °C, respectively. Figure 6(a) LSV spectra of Co9S8/N,S-PC composite catalysts

**Figure 6.** (a) LSV of Co9S8/N,S-PC prepared with different pyrolysis temperature; (b) LSV of Co9S8/N,S-PC composite catalysts with different loading; (c) The methanol resistance of Co9S8/N,S-PC and 20% Pt/C; (d) the stability of the catalyst.

prepared at different reaction temperatures, it can be seen from the figure that with the increase of reaction temperature, the oxygen reduction performance of composite catalysts shows a trend of first increasing and then decreasing. At the reaction temperature of 600°C, the oxygen reduction performance of the composite catalyst is the best, which is mainly reflected in the LSV spectrum of the composite catalyst at 600°C, and its half-wave potential is the most positive. The Tafel slope can reflect the speed of oxygen reduction on the surface of the composite catalyst. It can be concluded from the figure that at 600°C, the Tafel slope of the composite catalyst is the largest, so at 600 °C the oxygen reduction of the composite catalyst is the best catalysis activity.

The loading of the catalyst on the rotating disk electrode is also an important parameter to measure its oxygen reduction performance. Recent studies have shown that increasing the loading of the catalyst will increase the limiting current density of the catalyst for oxygen reduction and reduce the production of H2O2. The catalysts include not only Pt-based catalysts, but also some non-precious metal catalysts, such as CoSe2/C and Fe-NC. Figure 6(b) is the LSV spectra of different Co9S8 loadings. With the increase of loading, the half-wave potential and limiting current density of the composite catalysts both increased, mainly because oxygen will have enough time and energy in the thinner catalyst surface. Adjacent catalyst active sites reacted until the loading reached 0.382 mgcm <sup>2</sup> , and the oxygen reduction activity of the catalyst decreased slightly with increasing catalyst loading, which was caused by the loss of catalyst during the reaction. Therefore, the loading amount of 0.382 mgcm <sup>2</sup> is called the limit loading amount of the catalyst. Under the same test conditions, it is necessary to select this loading amount to prepare the rotating disk electrode to compare the oxygen reduction activity of the catalyst. This result is consistent with the research results of Feng Yongjun's research group from Beijing University of Chemical Technology.[43]

The selective catalysis of small molecules such as methanol in the system is also an important criterion for evaluating the performance of the composite catalyst. The methanol resistance performance of the composite catalyst was tested in a mixed solution of 0.1 M KOH and 0.05 M methanol, as can be seen from Figure 6(c). It can be concluded that in the presence of methanol, methanol will oxidize on the surface of the 20% Pt/C catalyst, thereby slowing down the oxygen reduction performance of the catalyst. The prepared Co9S8/porous carbon composite catalyst has good selectivity to methanol, and its half-wave potential does not appear negative shift. It can be seen from the figure that the methanol resistance of the composite catalyst is significantly better than that of commercial platinum carbon. In addition to the activity, the stability of the catalyst is also an important index to evaluate the oxygen reduction catalyst. The accelerated aging test method was used to determine the stability of the composite catalyst, that is, in the oxygen-saturated solution in the potential range of 0.2~1.0 V (vs. RHE) with a scan speed of 50 mVs 1 , as shown in Figure 6(d), after 500 cycles of testing, the half-wave potential of the catalyst shifted negatively by 18 mV, and the cycle test

8673899

was continued at 1000 cycles After 1500 cycles and 1500 cycles, the half-wave potential of the composite catalyst does not continue to shift negatively.

#### **Conclusions**

In conclusion, Co<sub>9</sub>S<sub>8</sub>/N,S-PC catalyst was prepared via the thermal treatment of self-assembled aggregate containing 2-mercaptobenzimidazole, 4,4-bipyridine and cobalt source. Benefit from the synergetic effect between Co<sub>9</sub>S<sub>8</sub> nanoparticles and well-designed carbon support, the catalyst showed excellent oxygen reduction performance in alkaline medium with cobalt sulfate as cobalt source and the pyrolysis temperature was 600 °C. Co<sub>9</sub>S<sub>8</sub>/porous carbon also showed a better stability and methanol tolerance ability than 20 wt% Pt/C. This material can be used as an active non-precious cathode electrocatalyst. The simple but efficient way can be further scaled up to be used in the area of fuel cell and metal-air battery.

## **Experimental Section**

# Synthesis of Co<sub>9</sub>S<sub>8</sub>/Porous Carbon

9 mmol cobalt salt (cobalt nitrate, cobalt acetate, cobalt chloride, or cobalt sulfate) and 8 mmol 2-mercaptobenzimidazole were dissolved in 80 mL DMF and stirred for 30 min, then 8 mmol 4,4′-bipyridine was added, until it was completely dissolved. This solution was transferred to a 100 mL Teflon autoclave, which was sealed and heated at 140 °C for 24 h. After cooling down to room temperature, the powder was washed with DMF, ethyl alcohol and water, and dried overnight. The as-fabricated powder was further annealed at 2°/min at 600 °C for 3 hours, with a nitrogen flow rate of 0.1 L/min to obtain Co<sub>9</sub>S<sub>8</sub>/N,S-PC. According to the cobalt sources, the samples are named as S1-Co(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, S2-Co(AC)<sub>2</sub>, S3-CoCl<sub>2</sub> and S4-CoSO<sub>4</sub>, respectively.

#### Characterizations

The surface morphology and the structure of the products were investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Tecnai G2) 20 TWIN) coupled with energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. To prepare the specimen, the asprepared samples were added into 2 mL of ethanol and sonicated for 1 min. The resulting suspension was drop casted onto a piece of a TEM grid. The crystal structure of the as-synthesized samples was identified by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Ultima IV, Rigaku, Cu,  $\lambda$ = 1.54 Å). The chemical composition and surface electronic state of the samples were studied with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy spectrometer (XPS, PHI GENESIS 900 with a monochromatic AI Ka X-ray source with the beam size of 100 um\*1400 um). Charge compensation was achieved by the dual beam charge neutralization and the binding energy was corrected by setting the binding energy of the hydrocarbon C 1s feature to 284.8 eV. Raman spectroscopy (RS) was carried out on Via of Renishaw using the air cooled 532 nm Ar-ion laser. FTIR spectra were obtained using Themonicolet Corporation Nexus 670 spectroscopy and the samples were mixed with KBr at the proportion of 1:100. The spectra was collected from 4000 cm<sup>-1</sup> to 400 cm<sup>-1</sup> with a resolution of  $2 \text{ cm}^{-1}$ .

#### **Electrochemical Measurements**

Electrochemical measurements of the catalysts were carried out on a conventional three-electrode system on a CHI 660D electrochemical workstation (Shanghai Chenhua, China). A rotating disk electrode (RDE, Pine Research Instrumentation, USA) of catalystcoated glassy carbon (GC, 5 mm diam.) was used as working electrode, saturated calomel electrode and carbon plate was utilized as reference and counter electrode, respectively. The ink consisting of 10 µL of the catalyst suspension, prepared by mixing 5.0 mg catalyst, 1.0 mL of ethanol and water (V<sub>ethanol</sub>:V<sub>water</sub>=4:1), and 50 μL of 5% Nafion®, was dropped onto the GC and dried at room temperature. ORR data was obtained at 25 °C in 0.1 M KOH. The ORR activity of commercial Pt/C was also tested under the same conditions. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) plots of the catalysts were implemented in 0.1 M KOH solution saturated with O2 in a potential range of 0.2 to 0.9 V (vs. RHE) at a scan rate of  $5~\text{mV}\,\text{s}^{-1}$  with the RDE rotation speeds from 400 to 2500 rpm. The methanol-tolerance capacity of the catalysts was measured by adding 3.0 M methanol in O<sub>2</sub>-saturated 0.1 M KOH. The Koutecky-Levich equation shown below was used to analyze the kinetic activity and mass transport in the system:[44,45]

$$\frac{1}{J} = \frac{1}{J_L} + \frac{1}{J_K} = \frac{1}{B\omega^{1/2}} + \frac{1}{J_K} \tag{1}$$

$$B = 0.62nFC_0 D^{2/3} v^{-1/6}$$
 (2)

Where J is the overall current density,  $J_L$  is the diffusion-limiting current density,  $J_K$  is the kinetic current density,  $\omega$  is the angular velocity of the disk ( $\omega=2\pi N$ ; N is the linear rotation speed), F is the Faraday constant (F=96485 C mol $^{-1}$ ),  $C_{O2}$  is the concentration of  $O_2$  in 0.1 M KOH ( $C_{O2}=1.2\times 10^{-6}~\text{mol cm}^{-3}$ ),  $D_{O2}$  is the diffusion coefficient of  $O_2$  in 0.1 M KOH ( $1.9\times 10^{-5}~\text{cm}^2~\text{s}^{-1}$ ), v is the kinematic viscosity of the electrolyte ( $v=0.01~\text{cm}^2~\text{s}^{-1}$ ), and n is the overall number of electrons transferred in the oxygen reduction process. According to Equations (1) and (2), the electron transfer number (n) can be obtained from the slope of the Koutecky-Levich plots.

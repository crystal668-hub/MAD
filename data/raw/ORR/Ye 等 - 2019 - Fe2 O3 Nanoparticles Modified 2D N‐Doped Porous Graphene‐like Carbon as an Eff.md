# Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> Nanoparticles Modified 2D N-Doped Porous Graphene-like Carbon as an Efficient and Robust Electrocatalyst for Oxygen Reduction Reaction

Yuzhen Ye, Bin Wang, Gaopeng Liu, Li Xu, Jiexiang Xia,\* and Huaming Li\*[a]

As the high expense and poor stability of Pt-based catalysts have severely limited the commercial applications of cathodic catalysts in fuel cells, the steps towards developing low-cost and stable catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) have never stopped. In this work, we designed a Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> nanoparticles decorated 2D N-doped porous graphene-like carbon material (Fe(1.0)–N/C-800) from the one-step pyrolysis of low-cost and abundant substrates ( $\beta$ -cyclodextrin, urea and FeCl<sub>3</sub>) under N<sub>2</sub> atmosphere. The doped N can change the charge distribution of C atoms around N atoms and offer active N species such as pyridinic-N and graphitic-N to provide more ORR active sites. The appropriate Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> nanoparticles encapsulated in the graphene-like carbon layer can enhance the electron and O<sub>2</sub>

transfer and boost the ORR process. Therefore, the synergetic effect of  $Fe_2O_3$  nanoparticles modifying and N doping can greatly promote the ORR process. The study on the poisoning of  $Fe^{3+}$  by  $SCN^-$  further reveals that the  $Fe_2O_3$  nanoparticles wrapped in the carbon layer will coordinate with N to form Fe-Nx active sites, which can further enhance ORR activity. Thus, the obtained Fe(1.0)–N/C-800 electrocatalyst possesses excellent ORR catalytic performance in alkaline media ( $E_{onset}\!=\!0.937$  V,  $E_{1/2}\!=\!0.832$  V) as well as a superior methanol tolerance and long-term test stability both in alkaline and acidic media. This work leads a simple and cost-efficient way to fabricate high-performance ORR catalysts.

#### Introduction

The increasingly serious depletion of fossil fuel energy has become a major threat to sustainable economic development.[1] Therefore, researchers pay more and more attention to new green energy sources, including fuel cells, dye-sensitized solar cells and other renewable energy technologies. Fuel cells are the chemical devices where the chemical energy of fuels can be immediately turned into electrical energy, [2] which are now considered to be the most promising energy conversion devices, because of their high energy density, conversion efficiency, and environmental friendliness.[3,4] The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) occurs at the cathode of fuel cells, and the noble metals (such as Pt, Pd, etc.)-based electrocatalysts had been deemed to be the most eminent catalysts for ORR. [5] However, this type of catalysts suffer from high-cost, intolerance of methanol, poor durability and cathode potential loss. These defects become the obstacle to commercial application of fuel cells. Therefore, it is urgently desired to develop non-noble metal catalysts with comparable performance and better stability to realize the commercialization of fuel cells technology.

extensively applied in ORR. From one-dimensional (1D) carbon nanotubes, [6] two-dimensional (2D) graphene, [7] to three-dimensional (3D) porous carbon materials, [8,9] nanocarbon materials are widely considered in the design of electrocatalyst for their good stability and excellent electrical conductivity. However, the pure carbon materials are short of ORR active sites and display poor ORR performance. In order to fabricate more oxygen reduction active sites, researchers turn their research direction to dope heteroatom (N, [10] S, [11] B, [12] P, [13] etc.) into carbon skeleton, which has been proved to be a powerful method to enhance ORR activity. Among them, the electronegativity of N is higher than that of C, which can change the electronic arrangement of carbon-based materials and adjust the electron donor-acceptor properties, thereby facilitating the adsorption of O2 and enabling the material to exhibit better ORR performance.[14,15]

Nanocarbon materials of different structure have been

To further improve the ORR activity, the transition metal (Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, etc.) modifying is induced to the heteroatom-doping carbon system. Currently reported ORR active sites formed by transition metal nanoparticles mainly include metal oxides, [16–18] metal carbides, [19,20] metal nitrides, [21,22] and metal sulfides. Notably, the excellent catalytic stability makes transition metal oxides modified and N-doped materials exhibit prominent ORR performance. [24] According to some reports, the Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> nanoparticles modified hierarchical hollow core-shell structured N-doped double-shelled carbon spheres (Fe – N-DSC) was prepared and exhibited a remarkable catalytic performance towards ORR.

heterostructures (*α*-Fe2O3@MoS2/NGNS) was synthesized as a high-efficient catalyst for ORR in fuel cell applications.[26] According to the literatures, the promotion of Fe2O3 modified and N doped electrocatalyst for ORR can be explained with the following points: The first one is the decorating of Fe2O3

nanoparticles inset in carbon layers, which is beneficial to ORR because it can reduce resistance and increase stability of the transportation between free electrons and oxygen.[27] The second one is the doping of N. It has been reported that the pyridinic-N is valuable active sites for ORR because the C atom next to the pyridinic-N has Lewis basicity and thus can strengthen the absorption of O2 to induce ORR. The graphitic-N can enhance conductivity and achieve faster electron transfer.[28,29] Thus, the synergetic effect of Fe2O3 decorating and N doping can maximize the ORR performance. However, the Fe**–**N**–**C catalysts still suffer many problems needing to be solved, like the easy agglomeration of metal particles and lacking practical value. Most importantly, the combined action of Fe2O3 nanoparticles decorating and N-doping remains unclear. Therefore, Fe2O3 nanoparticles modified N-doped carbon materials still require more in-depth researches.

Herein, we prepared a Fe2O3 nanoparticles modified 2D Ndoped porous carbon electrocatalyst (Fe(1.0)**–**N/C-800) by onestep pyrolysis of the composition of *β*-cyclodextrin, urea and FeCl3⋅6H2O (Scheme 1). The as-prepared Fe(1.0)**–**N/C-800 has a 2D graphene-like porous structure with Fe2O3 nanoparticles encapsulated in the carbon layers. The doped-N provides more ORR active sites in Fe(1.0)**–**N/C-800. The decorated Fe2O3 nanoparticles can strengthen the O2 transfer. The excellent ORR performance of Fe(1.0)**–**N/C-800 manifested a synergetic promotion of Fe2O3 decorationg and N-doping. The porous structure is beneficial to the mass transfer of ORR-related active species. Thus the Fe(1.0)**–**N/C-800 exhibits comparable ORR performance with Pt/C in 0.1 M KOH, and much better stability and methanol tolerance both in alkaline and acid medium. The above results prove that Fe(1.0)**–**N/C-800 is an excellent electrocatalyst with practical application potential. This study provides a novel design of highly efficient ORR electrocatalysts from cost-efficient and earth-abundant material.

## **Result and discussion**

The XRD pattern was used to characterize the crystalline structure of the catalysts (Figure 1a). Neither the C-800 nor N/ C-800 exhibits the significant characteristic peak of graphite carbon, indicating the doping of N contributes to the disorder of carbon.[30] With the introduction of Fe, a sharp peak at about 2*θ*=26.32° can be observed, corresponding to the (002) diffraction of the graphite carbon. With respect to Fe(1.0)–N/C-800, the characteristic peaks of Fe2O3 can be observed at 2*θ* =33.20°, 35.68° and 54.14°, conforming to (104), (110) and (116) facets respectively (Fe2O3, JCPDS No.84-0308). It has been reported that Fe can catalyze the graphitization of carbon during pyrolysis.[31] Therefore, the Fe(1.0)/C-800 and Fe(1.0)**–**N/ C-800 both show sharper carbon peak than C-800 and N/C-800. Compared to that of C-800 and N/C-800, the carbon peak of Fe

(1.0)/C-800 and Fe(1.0)–N/C-800 shows evident shift from about 23° to 26.32°, revealing high-crystallinity graphitic carbon.[32] In addition, the XRD pattern of Fe(1.0)–N/C X (X=700, 800 and 900) catalysts is displayed in Figure S1a. As the calcination temperature increases from 700°C to 900°C, the peak of carbon become stronger and the characteristic peaks of Fe2O3 still appear. Fe, Co and Ni all belong to transition metal elements and are widely used as modifier metals to enhance ORR performance. According to the literature, the catalytic activity follows the sequence of Fe *>* Co *>* Ni.[33] To further confirm the result, the Co(1.0)–N/C-800 and Ni(1.0)–N/C-800 are prepared. The characteristic peaks of zero-valent Co (JCPDS No.15-0806) and zero-valent Ni (JCPDS No.04-0850) can be observed in Co(1.0)–N/C-800 and Ni(1.0)–N/C-800 respectively (Figure S2). As is displayed in Figure S3, the characteristic peaks of zero-valent Fe (JCPDS No.87-0722), Fe3O4 (JCPDS No.75- 0033) and Fe2O3 (JCPDS No.84-0308) appear in the Fe(1.0)/C-800 and Fe(1.0)–N/C-800 catalysts without acid treatment, indicating that acid leaching will remove the unstable Fe/Fe3O4 particles without wrapping in the carbon layer. The Raman spectra were tested to measure the graphitization of different samples. In Figure 1b, the typical D-band (∼1350 cm–1) and Gband (∼1580 cm–1) correspond to the disorder and the vibration of sp<sup>2</sup> -bonded carbon atoms, respectively.[34] The *ID/IG* values of C-800, N/C-800, Fe(1.0)/C-800 and Fe(1.0)–N/C-800 are calculated to be 0.97, 1.11, 0.81 and 0.76 respectively, indicating that the decorating of Fe is conducive to increase the graphitization of materials.[31] Figure S1b presents the Raman spectra of Fe(1.0)–N/C X (X=700, 800 and 900). The *ID/ IG* values are 1.07, 0.76 and 0.73 respectively, signifying that the higher the calcination temperature, the higher the degree of graphitization of the sample. The result is accord with the XRD data.

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were recorded to investigate the microscopic morphology and microstructure of the as-prepared catalysts. As shown in Figure S4a, the C-800 is a bulk material and there is no obvious holes structure. With the doping of N, the N/C-800 possesses clear porous structure (Figure S4b and S4e), which may be formed by the volatilization of ammonia from urea during pyrolysis process.[35] When the Fe is introduced, the Fe(1.0)/C-800 possesses thin layered structure (Figure S4c, d and f), which indicates that the adding of Fe is beneficial to form the highly graphitized layer structure.[31] As shown in Figure 2a, the Fe(1.0)–N/C-800 catalyst exhibits a 2D graphene-like porous structure. TEM image reveals that there

are some particles existing in the carbon layer (Figure 2b**)**. Figure 2c is the HR-TEM image, which clearly shows a lattice fringe spacing of 0.219 nm that can be indexed as (113) planes of Fe2O3. And the Fe2O3 particles are wrapped by the graphite carbon, which presents a lattice fringe spacing of 0.34 nm assigning to the (002) facet. It indicates that the Fe2O3 nanoparticles are successfully inset into the N-doped carbon based material. Additionally, the Co(1.0)–N/C-800 and Ni(1.0)– N/C-800 synthesized by the same route display similar structure with Fe(1.0)–N/C-800, both exhibiting 2D porous structure with metal particles encapsulated in the carbon layer (Figure S5). Figure 2d is the EDS analysis of Fe(1.0)–N/C-800, revealing the presence of Fe, N, C, O in Fe(1.0)–N/C-800. Furthermore, the atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) was tested to measure the metal content of the metal-containing catalysts (Table S1). The Fe(1.0)–N/C-800 contains the highest Fe content of 8.32 wt %, which means that pyrolysis at 800°C together with using Fe as metal source is the most favourable condition to encapsulating the metal particles in the carbon layer.

The specific area and porosity of the samples were measured by the nitrogen adsorption-desorption technique. The as-prepared catalysts all presented the type IV isotherm with significant hysteresis loop (0.4 to 1.0 P/P0), implying the presence of multiple micro/mesoporous structure of the samples (Figure S6). The average pore size of Fe(1.0)–N/C-800, Fe/C-800, N/C-800 and C-800 catalysts was 5.39, 4.29, 1.67 and 1.97 nm, with corresponding pore volume of 0.32, 0.29, 0.08 and 0.01 cm<sup>3</sup> /g, respectively (Table S2). This signifies that the doping of N and Fe2O3 decorating both facilitate to form the porous structure, which agrees to the SEM results. The porous structure of the catalyst facilitates the contact of the relevant active species with the catalyst, thereby promoting catalytic performance.

The chemical compositions of Fe(1.0)–N/C-800 catalyst was verified by XPS. The full XPS spectra of Fe(1.0)–N/C-800 (Figure S7) reveals the co-existence of Fe, C, O and N, which is consistent with the conclusion of EDS analysis (Figure 2d). The result of elemental mapping (Figure S8) shows the uniform distribution of the four elements mentioned above. In order to further explore the chemical states of the elements presented in Fe(1.0)–N/C-800 catalyst, the high-resolution XPS spectra of Fe 2*p*, N 1s, O 1s and C 1s was studied. As shown in Figure 3a, Fe 2*p* spectra can be deconvoluted into four peaks.[36] The two peaks at 711.5 eV and 725.0 eV are assigned to the binding energy of Fe<sup>3</sup><sup>+</sup> 2*p*3/2 and Fe3<sup>+</sup> 2*p*1/2, respectively. The other two peaks at 718.5 eV and 733.0 eV correspond to the satellite

peaks. All these are typical features of Fe2O3. In addition, there are no obvious peaks for Fe(0) at 707.0 eV and Fe(II) at 709.0 eV, indicating that all the Fe in the catalyst exists in the form of Fe2O3. The high-resolution XPS spectra of N 1s (Figure 3b) shows the N in Fe(1.0)–N/C-800 mainly exists in pyridinic-N (398.8 eV), pyrrolic-N (399.7 eV), graphitic-N (400.9 eV) and oxidized-N (402.2 eV).[37] As shown in Table S3, the pyridinic-N and graphitic-N account for 30.1% and 50.6% of the total N content, much more than pyrrolic-N (9.5%) and oxidized-N (9.8%). According to some reports, the pyridinic-N and graphitic-N are good for ORR because pyridinic-N can strengthen O2 absorption and graphitic-N can enhance conductivity, respectively.[38] In Figure 3c, the C 1s peak can be fitted to C=C (284.8 eV), C=N&C–O (285.8 eV), C–N&C=O (287.1 eV) and O–C=O (289.6 eV), proving that the C atoms are combined with N and O atoms.[39] As for the O 1s spectra (Figure 3d), three peaks observed at 530.2 eV, 531.2 eV and 532.7 eV, are assigned to Fe–O bond in Fe2O3, C=O, O-C=O and physically absorbed O respectively.[40]

To study the oxygen reduction catalytic properties of the Fe (1.0)–N/C-800 catalyst, the CV and LSV curves were investigated in O2/N2-saturated 0.1 M KOH. A clear oxygen reduction peak of Fe(1.0)–N/C-800 appears in the CV profile for the O2-saturated case (**Figure S9a**), proving the sample's response to oxygen reduction. In Figure 4a, the Fe(1.0)–N/C-800 catalyst exhibits an outstanding ORR performance (*Eonset* = 0.937 V *vs* RHE, *E1/2*= 0.832 V *vs* RHE, *JL*=5.112 mAcm–2). The ORR performance of C-800, N/C-800 and Fe(1.0)/C-800 catalysts was tested to evaluate the importance of Fe2O3 modifying and N doping. Lacking of ORR active sites, the C-800 displays poor ORR performance (*Eonset*=0.788 V *vs* RHE, *E1/2*=0.615 V *vs* RHE, *JL*=2.557 mAcm–2). Related to C-800, both the N/C-800(*Eonset*=0.846 V *vs* RHE, *E1/2*= 0.722 V *vs* RHE, *JL*=3.523 mAcm–2) and the Fe(1.0)/C-800 (*Eonset*=0.797 V *vs* RHE, *E1/2*=0.642 V *vs* RHE, *JL*=3.323 mAcm–2) show improved onsetpotential, half-wave potential and current density. The above results reveal that both the Fe2O3 modifying and N-doping can promote ORR performance of carbon based materials. However, the promotion of only N-doping or Fe2O3 modifying sample is limited. Only both the N and Fe2O3 are introduced into the catalyst, the ORR performance of Fe(1.0)–N/ C-800 can be promoted maximally. **Figure S10** is the EIS of Fe (1.0)–N/C-800, C-800, N/C-800 and Fe(1.0)/C-800 catalysts. With the introduction of N and Fe2O3 nanoparticles, the arc radius of Fe(1.0)–N/C-800 become the smallest. Generally, arc radius is related to the charge transfer resistance of the electrode surface. A small arc radius leads to the low resistance in the

Nyquist diagram.[41] As shown in Figure S10, the ORR activity follows the change of arc radius of the four samples, suggesting that the improvement of ORR activity is related to the reduction of impedance value caused by N-doping and Fe2O3 modification. Therefore the desirable ORR activity of Fe (1.0)–N/C-800 is mainly attributed to the synergetic effect of Fe2O3 nanoparticles decorating and N-doping. Compared with Pt/C (*Eonset*=0.961 V *vs* RHE, *E1/2*=0.815 V *vs* RHE, *JL*= 5.185 mAcm–2), the Fe(1.0)–N/C-800 catalyst has a positive shift of 17 mV in half-wave potential. Moreover, compared with other reported ORR electrocatalysts such as Co/N/CNT@PC-800 (*Eonset* =0.969 V *vs* RHE, *E1/2* = 0.791 V *vs* RHE, *JL*=4.117 mAcm– 2 ) and NGA (*Eonset* =0.934 V *vs* RHE, *E1/2*=0.794 V *vs* RHE, *JL*= 3.623 mAcm–2),[37,42] the Fe(1.0)–N/C-800 possesses better ORR performance. These experiment results and researches all come to the conclusion that the Fe(1.0)–N/C-800 catalyst is a highefficiency ORR electrocatalyst.

In the RRDE test (Figure 4b), the electron transfer number of Fe(1.0)–N/C-800 and Pt/C were calculated to be 3.79∼3.98 and 3.94∼3.97, respectively. The H2O2 yield of Fe(1.0)–N/C-800 (10.56%) is slightly higher than Pt/C (3.94%). This means that the ORR process catalyzed by Fe(1.0)–N/C-800 is a quasi 4 electron reaction path. Figure S11a shows the K L plots and corresponding calculated electron number for Fe(1.0)–N/C-800, also indicating a quasi 4-electron path during the ORR process. Chronoamperometry technique (i-t) was conducted to measure the stability of Fe(1.0)–N/C-800 and Pt/C at 0.464 V in O2 satrurated 0.1 M KOH. As shown in Figure 4c, the Fe(1.0)–N/C-800 shows a related current density attenuation of 13.9% after 30000 s i-t test, while the decrease for Pt/C is 27.4%. Figure S12a and S12b are the TEM images of Fe(1.0)–N/C-800 after 30000 s i-t test. The Fe2O3 nanoparticles are still uniformly distributed in the thin carbon layer and the catalyst maintains a porous structure. This indicates that the Fe(1.0)–N/C-800 exhibited remarkable catalytic stability. The methanol resistance of Fe(1.0)–N/C-800 and Pt/C was tested by chronoamperometry (Figure 4d) and CV (Figure S13a) in O2-satrurated 0.1 M KOH. Figure 4d shows the i-t curves of Fe(1.0)–N/C-800 and Pt/ C catalysts. When CH3OH is injected into electrolyte, the current of Pt/C suffers a rapid drop. But the Fe(1.0)–N/C-800 presents no significant crossover effect. As shown in Figure S13a, the cathodic oxygen reduction peak of Pt/C vanishes and a characteristic peak of the methanol oxidation appears with the adding of CH3OH. On the contrary, there is no change in the CV curve of Fe(1.0)–N/C-800. The results above both demonstrate that the as-prepared Fe(1.0)–N/C-800 catalyst possesses excellent methanol tolerance and will be an ideal candidate for direct methanol fuel cells.

At the same time, the effect of different pyrolysis temperatures on catalytic performance was further explored. Figure S14a is the LSV curves of the Fe(1.0)–N/C X (X=700, 800 and 900) catalysts in 0.1 M KOH. The Fe(1.0)–N/C-800 possesses the highest ORR activity. This can be ascribed to the Fe(1.0)–N/ C-800 containing not only the highest Fe content (Table S1), but also the most appropriate graphitization degree (Figure 1a and b). Meanwhile, different metal sources were used for comparison in Figure S15a. The ORR activity in 0.1 M KOH solution follows the order of Fe(1.0)–N/C-800 *>* Co(1.0)–N/C-800 *>* Ni(1.0)–N/C-800. The result is consistent with the literature that the ORR activity of M–N–C catalysts follows the sequence of Fe *>* Co *>* Ni.[32] Additionally, the influence of acid leaching for the ORR performance of Fe-containing catalysts was tested (Figure S16). Both the Fe(1.0)/C-800 and Fe(1.0)–N/ C-800 catalysts show better catalytic performance after acid leaching than before acid leaching. According to some reports, the acid treatment helps to remove the agglomerating metallic particles thus revealing high densities of active sites.[43]

Apart from alkaline electrolyte, the ORR properties of the material was also tested in acidic electrolyte. Figure 5a displays the ORR performance of Fe(1.0)–N/C-800, C-800, N/C-800 and Fe(1.0)/C-800 catalysts in O2-saturated 0.1 M HClO4. The Fe(1.0)– N/C-800 possesses the optimal catalytic ability (*Eonset*=0.785 V *vs* RHE, *E1/2*=0.638 V *vs* RHE, *JL*=5.065 mAcm–2). Compared with the samples calcined at 700°C and 900°C (Figure S14b), the Fe(1.0)–N/C-800 also possesses the best catalytic activity, implying that calcination at 800°C is the most suitable calcination temperature. Figure S15b is the LSV curves of Fe (1.0)–N/C-800, Co(1.0)–N/C-800 and Ni(1.0)–N/C-800, corroborating that Fe is the most appropriate decorating metal in this system. All these results mentioned above indicate that the decorating of Fe2O3 and N-doping can maximize the ORR performance. As shown in Figure 5b, the electron transfer number for Fe(1.0)–N/C-800 is 3.59∼3.92. And the yields of H2O2 is lower than 20.34% at 0.2–0.8 V *vs* RHE. Although the Fe (1.0)–N/C-800 exhibit slightly inferior ORR performance with Pt/ C (Figure 5a), it shows remarkable long-term test stability (Figure 5c) and tolerance to methanol poisoning effect (Figure 5d and S13b). After 30000 s i-t test in acidic media, the Fe2O3 nanoparticles does not suffer corrosion and still uniformly dispersed in the porous carbon (Figure S12c and S12d). Compared with some previously reported electrocatalysts, the Fe(1.0)–N/C-800 possesses much better ORR performance, such as Fe**–**N/C-800 (*Eonset*=0.72 V *vs* RHE, *E1/2*=0.55 V *vs* RHE, *JL*= 6.0 mAcm–2) and Fe**–**P-900 (*Eonset*=0.84 V *vs* RHE, *E1/2*=0.52 V *vs* RHE, *JL*=5.5 mAcm–2).[44,45] The above results reveal that the Fe (1.0)–N/C-800 also has an application value under acidic conditions.

According to the literature, the pyridinic-N locates at the edge of the carbon skeleton, thus it is likely to form the M–Nx active sites with metals.[46] In order to explore whether Fe2O3 modifying and N-doping would form the Fe–Nx active sites, 5 mmol KSCN were added into 0.1 M KOH during the LSV test. The Fe(1.0)–N/C-800 shows obvious degradation of ORR activity both in onsetpotential and limited current density (Figure 6a) because the SCN– can coordinate with Fe<sup>3</sup><sup>+</sup> to form a stable chelate complex thereby breaking the Fe–Nx structure.[47] The performance of C-800, N/C-800 and Fe(1.0)/C-800 display no significant decay (Figure 6b). Consistent results are also obtained in acidic media (Figure S17). The above result manifests that the Fe–Nx structure exists in Fe(1.0)–N/C-800 to boost ORR property.

Based on the characterizations and experiment results mentioned above, the explanation for the Fe(1.0)–N/C-800 presenting the greatest ORR performance can be concluded to

the following points. Primarily, the doping of N provides the high content of the active pyridinic-N and graphitic-N species to facilitate the ORR activity. The pyridinic-N can strengthen the adsorption of oxygen and weaken the O–O bond energy.[48] Graphitic-N offers a better conductivity leading to higher current density.[49] In addition, the Fe2O3 nanoparticles wrap-

ping in the carbon layers can enhance the contact between carbon and metal oxides, which is beneficial to the interfacial charge and O2 transfer. Moreover, both the N-doping and Fe2O3 modifying make Fe(1.0)–N/C-800 owning a porous graphenelike structure which is more conductive for ORR-related species to be catalyzed. Finally, the synergetic effect of N-doping and Fe2O3 modifying leads to form Fe–Nx sites to stimulate ORR performance in Fe(1.0)–N/C-800 catalyst.

## **Conclusions**

To summarize, we have designed a facile and cost-efficient method to fabricate a Fe2O3 nanoparticles decorated 2D Ndoped graphene-like porous carbon material as a highly efficient electrocatalyst for ORR. N-doping provides the high content of pyridinic-N and graphitic-N which can better carry out the ORR process by forming more active sites and enhancing electroconductivity, respectively. The Fe2O3 nanoparticles wrapping in the carbon layer can optimize the charge and O2 transfer. Moreover, the synergetic effect of Fe2O3 nanoparticles modifying and N doping on the porous carbon caused a best ORR efficiency. Thus, the as-prepared Fe(1.0)–N/ C-800 displays excellent ORR performance, marvelous longterm test stability and methanol resistance in alkaline media. In acidic media, the Fe(1.0)–N/C-800 has comparable ORR property with other reported electrocatalysts and owns much better stability than Pt/C. This work offers future directions for the design of novel ORR electrocatalysts and make efforts to realize the commercial application of fuel cells.

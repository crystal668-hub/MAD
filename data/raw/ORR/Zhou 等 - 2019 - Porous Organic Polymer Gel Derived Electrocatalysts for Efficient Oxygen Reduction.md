**Abstract:** Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), as one of the most critical reactions for energy conversion, has attracted increasing research interest. Recent reports have evidenced that carbonization of heteroatoms doped porous organic polymers (POPs) is an effective approach toward highly efficient ORR electrocatalysts. We herein report a versatile ternary copolymerization strategy to synthesize stable POPs gel with tunable doping of heteroatoms (N, S, F) and Fe species, leading to significant enhancement in surface area and porosity. Carbonization of these POPs afford efficient ORR electrocatalyst with optimized composition, hierarchical porous structure and prominent catalytic activities in both alkaline and neutral conditions. The optimized catalyst (TF-C-900) exhibited an onset potential (*Eonset*) of 1.01 V and half-wave potential (*E1/2*) of 0.88 V in 0.1 M KOH solution. These performance metrics are even comparable to those of the Pt/C (0.99 and 0.85). In addition, the TF-C-900 also showed superior stability and advantage of methanol tolerance, enabling them to be a competitive cathode electrocatalysts for alkaline fuel cell.

#### **Introduction**

With growing concerns on environmental pollution and increasing demands on green energy,<sup>1</sup> sustainable energy storage and conversion technologies has become more important than ever before.<sup>2</sup> The associated electrode materials featuring higher performance, lower cost and more ecofriendliness play critical role in the energy storage and conversion technology,<sup>3</sup> such as rechargeable lithium battery, fuel cells, and metal-air batteries. 4

Porous organic polymers (POPs) are emerging functional materials completely composed of organic building blocks and show potential applications in the field of heterogeneous catalysis,<sup>5</sup> sensing, 6 light emitting and organic photovoltaics, 7 environmental remediation,8,9 drug delivery<sup>10</sup> and renewable energy<sup>11</sup> etc., thanks to their attractive properties of high porosity, light weight, tunable porous structures, tailorable functions, and eco-friendliness. In addition, the inherent rigid porous structure could be maintained even after carbonization, enabling it to be

ideal precursors for preparing novel porous carbon.<sup>12</sup> Hitherto, numerous POPs have been reported, but large scale preparation of POPs in low cost remains one of the most obstacles for practical applications. <sup>13</sup> Among various POPs, porous polyaminals represent one of the cost effective POPs. Easily available precursors and simple reaction conditions made polyaminal based POPs could be facilely produced in mass, 12a,14 while high nitrogen content and feasible structural tunability enable them as ideal precursors for fabricating highly active electrocatalysts.12a

Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) has been intensively studied due to the important role in various energy conversion devices. However, there still remain numerous obstacles for developing Pt based eletrocatalysts despite of their high activity for ORR,<sup>15</sup> including high production cost, poor durability, and susceptibility to poisoning.<sup>16</sup> Hence, it is imperative to explore low-cost Pt alternative electrocatalysts with high activities and considerable stability for implementing a variety of sustainable electrochemical energy devices.<sup>17</sup>

In this article, a series of aminal-linked (-NH-CH-NH-, dashed oval in Figure 1) POPs gels were prepared by ternary copolymerization of two industrial available aldehydes (ferrocenealdehyde (Fc-CHO) and benzaldehyde (Bn-CHO), or Fc-CHO and 4-(trifluoromethyl)benzaldehyde (TF-CHO)) with melamine (MA) *via* facile and economic Schiff base reaction. Apart from the increased porosity and CO<sup>2</sup> uptake capacity, multiple dopants (N, F and Fe) could be facilely introduced into the porous skeletons. In addition, the gelation solvent dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) was used directly as the sulphur source for preparation of multiple elements doped porous carbon-based catalysts *via* simple pyrolysis of the 3D polymer gels. The pyrolysed porous carbon composite with hierarchical porous structure exhibited excellent electrocatalytic activity in both basic and neutral electrolyte. Furthermore, a homemade Zn-air battery with the as-prepared carbon composites as cathode materials showed highly desirable performance with high energy density and good long-term stability.

#### **Results and Discussion**

As presented in Figure 1, two terpolymers (Bn-Fc-MA POP, TF-Fc-MA POP) were synthesized by the ternary copolymerization of MA and Fc-CHO with Bn-CHO or TF-CHO in DMSO.12a For comparison, a bipolymer (Fc-MA POP) was also prepared by copolymerization of only MA and Fc-CHO. The detailed procedure was described in supplementary information (SI, Scheme S1). Various copolymerization parameters like solvents and molar ratio of the three monomers were tuned. When DMSO was used as the solvent and the ratio of TF-CHO/Fc-CHO/MA was fixed at 1:2:1, the resulted TF-Fc-MA POPs exhibited the highest porosity among others. Subsequent pyrolysis of these porous polymer gel yielded heteroatoms doped porous carbons. Three carbonization temperatures (800,

900, and 1000 <sup>o</sup>C) were adopted for carbonizing TF-Fc-MA POPs to optimize the composition and electrocatalytic activity of the afforded carbon composite. The resulted carbon composites were named as TF-C-X (X denotes the pyrolysis temperature).

**Figure 1.** Schematic illustration of the synthesis of the multiple doped porous polymers gel and corresponding carbonized catalysts.

To validate the structure of the 3D polyaminal networks, various characterizations were performed. As shown in Figure S1a-S1b, the FT-IR spectra pf all the polymers displayed vibration bands at 2926 cm-1 , 3400 and 1190 cm-1 , which is assignable to the newly formed methylene (-CH-) and secondary amine (N-H), respectively. <sup>14</sup> In addition, characteristic vibrations at 1556, 1481 cm-1 can be attributed to the triazine units. Characteristic stretching vibration band of C-F located at 1330 cm-1 was observed for TF-Fc-MA-POP.<sup>18</sup> Furthermore, typical vibration bands at 1100 and 1010 cm-1 assignable to ferrocene were detected for all three polymers.<sup>19</sup> These results demonstrated that all the three monomers are successfully integrated into the porous networks by covalent aminal linkages.

Solid state 1H-<sup>13</sup>C NMR spectra further validated the formation of polyaminal backbones in the porous networks (Figure S1c). Intense signals around 164 ppm is assignable to the carbon of triazine aromatic rings. Resonances appeared from 100 to 150 ppm are attributed to the corresponding phenyl, cyclopentadienyl anion, respectively.12a,14 The down-field shift between the sp<sup>3</sup> carbon signal of Bn-Fc-MA (53.2 ppm) and TF-Fc-MA (58.3 ppm) could be attributed to the strong electron withdrawing effect of CF<sup>3</sup> groups. Other peaks located at less than 65 ppm were assigned to the newly formed tertiary carbons. All these results further validated the formation of aminal linkages, indicating the feasibility of the ternary copolymerization strategy.

The morphologies of these materials was examined by the scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) and transmission electronic microscopy (TEM). As presented in Figure 2a-2c, the SEM images reveal that all these polymers are spherical-like particles. Widely distributed pores ranged from microporous to mesoporous could be observed from TEM images (Figure 2d-i), which further confirmed the porous structure of these polyaminal POPs. The powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) pattern only exhibit weak and broad peaks around 22-25<sup>o</sup> (Figure S2a), implying the amorphous nature of these POPs.

Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) demonstrated all these polymers exhibited excellent thermal stability with a weight loss

less than 52% even at 1000 <sup>o</sup>C, which is favorable for the preparation of porous carbons (Figure S1d). The weight loss occurred at the initial stage (30-100 <sup>o</sup>C) is assignable to the evaporation of water in the porous skeletons. And the weight loss between 100 and 350 <sup>o</sup>C is attributed to the decomposition of DMSO accompanying with S doping.17b

The porosity of polyaminal based POPs was evaluated by N<sup>2</sup> sorption measurements at 77 K. As shown in Figure 3a, the uptake curves exhibit steep increments for all these POPs at low relative pressure range (P/P<sup>0</sup> < 0.01), implying microporous features.<sup>19</sup> Continuously increased gas adsorption together with hysteresis loop could be observed in the pressure range from 0.4 to 1.0, indicating the coexistence of mesoporous and macropore.<sup>20</sup> The calculated BET surface area for the

biopolymer Fc-MA POP was merely 147 m<sup>2</sup> g -1 , but it increased to 633 and 756 m<sup>2</sup> g -1 for the terpolymer Bn-Fc-MA POP and TF-Fc-MA POP, respectively. The corresponding total pore volume was also increased from 0.37 for the biopolymer Fc-MA POP to 0.75 and 0.87 m<sup>3</sup> g -1 for Bn-Fc-MA POP and TF-Fc-MA POP, respectively. Figure 3b shows the pore size distribution curve of the three polyaminal POPs, where both micropores and mesopores could be found and the detailed information was summarized in Table S1. These results demonstrated the ternary copolymerization method could greatly improve the porosities of POPs.

To further evaluate the porous properties, CO<sup>2</sup> sorption experiments were conducted at 273 K. As presented in Figure 3c, reversible isotherms were observed for all three polymers with a rapid uptake at low pressure regions, indicative of strong interactions between CO<sup>2</sup> molecule and the multiple doped (N, Fe, F) porous networks. With the increment of pressure, continuously uptake and no saturation plateau was observed in the experimental pressure range. The CO<sup>2</sup> uptake capacity increased from 7.3 wt% (Fc-MA POP) to 9.8 wt% (Bn-Fc-MA POP) and 11.6 wt% (TF-Fc-MA POP) at 273 K and 1 bar, demonstrating the ternary copolymerization methods are beneficial for improving the CO<sup>2</sup> capacities of POPs.

The morphologies and porosities of the pyrolysed catalysts were further visualized by SEM and TEM images (Figure 4 and Figure S4). SEM images of TF-C-800, TF-C-900 and TF-C-1000 (Figure 4a-c) displayed globular agglomerate morphologies with rough surface. TEM images of TF-C-900 are presented in Figure 4d-f, where hierarchical pore structure ranged from micropore to macropore could be visualized. The hierarchically porous structure might be derived from the removal or decomposition of DMSO solvent molecule which served as the porgen.<sup>21</sup> As shown in Figure 4d-f, iron-based particles in similar size were highly dispersed over the carbon composites. And these results further proved the porous gel structure was feasible for the preparation of hierarchically porous carbon with multiple dopants which is advantageous for electrocatalysis. The elemental mapping of TF-C-900 demonstrates evenly distributed C, N, S, O and Fe (Figure 4j-l). And the corresponding EDS of SEM images further confirm the coexistence of the aforementioned elements (Figure S5).

As presented in Figure 5e, obvious D band (1349 cm-1 ) and G band (1580 cm-1 ) was observed in the Raman spectra for all these pyrolysed samples. The high intensity of G band indicated a high graphitic degree of these samples (*I*G/*I*D= 1.56, 1.46, 1.42 for TF-C-800, TF-C-900 and TF-C-1000, respectively). This was probably due to the catalytic effect of iron species during the carbonization process as reported before.<sup>22</sup>

Different from the POP precursors (Figure S2), the PXRD pattern (Figure 5f) of the carbonized composites exhibited characteristic peaks of metallic Fe (44.8 and 65.1<sup>o</sup> , JCPDS No. 87-0722) 26b and Fe3C (JCPDS No. 89-2867).12a, 22b The porosity of these carbonized composites was further investigated. As displayed in Figure S3, the N<sup>2</sup> sorption isotherm of the composites exhibited typical type I and type IV characteristics, demonstrating the coexistence of micoropores and mesopores. In addition, all the carbonized samples hold large BET surface areas which are feasible for the conduction of catalysis.<sup>24</sup> The detailed porosity date was also summarized in Table S1.

The survey spectra of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) displayed characteristic peaks for C (284.6 eV), N (400.8 eV), S (163.4 eV), O (531.9 eV) and Fe (710.7 eV) for the TF-C-X catalysts, further demonstrated successful implement of multiple dopants (N, S and Fe) into the porous carbon (Figure 5d and Figure S6a).<sup>25</sup> As displayed in Figure 5d, the XPS survey spectra of TF-C-900 revealed the coexistence of C (90.9 at.%),

N (2.68 at.%), Fe (1.76 at.%) and S (1.46 at.%). High-resolution N 1s XPS spectra (Figure 5b) proved the existence of pyridinic N (398.4 eV), graphitic N (401.0 eV), pyrrolic N (399.8 eV) and oxidized N (403.5 eV) in TF-C-900. 12a,26 TF-C-900 holds the highest content of pyridinic N (1.16 at.%) among TF-C-X, which is beneficial for the formation of catalytic Fe-N<sub>X</sub>-C species. 12a, 24, <sup>26</sup> In terms of Fe 2p (Figure 5a) spectra, characteristic peaks of  $Fe^{3+}$  appeared at 710.38 (2p 1/2) and 725.8 eV (2p 3/2), respectively, while the signal at 717.08 eV was attributed to the satellite peak. In addition, the characteristic peak of Fe<sup>2+</sup>2p 1/2 was located at 723.1 eV. The remaining peaks at 713.3 eV was assignable to Fe<sup>2+</sup>2p 3/2. High resolution S 2p (Figure 5c) peaks could be deconvoluted into three different peaks at 163.5, 164.9 and 168.3 eV, respectively.<sup>27</sup> The first two peaks were attributed to the thiophene type S 2p 3/2 and 2p 1/2, while the latter peak was assignable to the oxidized sulphur.<sup>25</sup>

The catalytic activity of the pyrolysed carbon composites and commercial Pt/C (20%, as the reference) was evaluated in both alkaline and neutral conditions by both rotating disk electrode (RDE) and rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE) technologies. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) were initially conducted in 0.1 M KOH saturated with oxygen or argon from 0.1 to 1.2 V (vs. RHE). Compared with the CV curves obtained in Ar-saturated media, an obvious increased

cathodic current density was observed for all these catalysts in saturated oxygen conditions (Figure 6a and Figure S7). Among them, the TF-C-900 displayed the most positive cathodic peaks at 0.810 V, comparable to the commercial Pt/C (0.811 V, Figure S8b). RDE experiments were measured in oxygen saturated solution at a scan rate of 5 mV s<sup>-1</sup>. As presented in Figure 6b-c, the TF-C-900 presents the highest catalytic activities, as manifested by the  $E_{onset}$  of 1.011 V (j = 0.1 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, 26 mV positive than commercial Pt/C) and  $E_{1/2}$  of 0.882 V (26 mV positive than commercial Pt/C:  $E_{onset} = 0.985$  V and  $E_{1/2} = 0.856$ V). As shown in Figure 6b, compared with the other catalysts, the TF-C-900 (1:2, i.e. TF-CHO/Fc-CHO = 1:2) also exhibited the most prominent ORR activity. Koutechy-Levich (K-L) plots derived from relevant LSV curves on the basis of K-L equation (Equation 1, ESI) was used to determine the catalytic ORR pathways. As shown in LSV curves, the current density increased with the increment of the scanning rates (Figure 6d and Figure S8). The transferred electron numbers (n) were calculated to be 3.97 for the TF-C-900 at 0.5 V, revealing a four electron process upon catalysis of ORR. Furthermore, the TF-C-900 exhibited a higher limiting current density of about 6.92 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> (at 0.5 V) than that of commercial Pt/C (6.71 mA).

To further investigate the ORR pathways and the yield of hydrogen peroxide, rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) technique was performed. As exhibited in Figure 6e, a rather low  $H_2O_2$  yield was observed for TF-C-900. According to Equation 3 (ESI) and Equation 4 (ESI), the electron transferred number calculated from the RRDE result is ranged from 3.92 to 3.97 for TF-C-900, being well consistent with the results obtained from K-L plots, which again demonstrates a four electron ORR pathway. The  $H_2O_2$  generation yield of TF-C-900 is below 3.5 % at the potential from 0.1 to 0.8 V.

The long term stability is another critical parameter for application of practical electrocatalysts. Thus. chronoamperometric measurements were conducted (Figure 6f). After a long cycling time of 30000 s, a decay of 17.0 % in current was observed for TF-C-900 catalyst, showing remarkably advantage over the Pt/C that decay 47% after 18000 s running. We subsequently examined the methanol tolerant ability of TF-C-900 (Figure S9a). Compared with the commercial Pt/C, a negligible current decay was observed for TF-C-900 upon the addition of methanol (3.0 M). The polarization curves before and after the addition of methanol was shown in Figure S9c. For TF-C-900, nearly identical curves could be detected with a small negative shift ( $E_{1/2}$  =16 mV vs. 300 mV for Pt/C), implying the TF-C-900 show a good methanol "immunity".

On the other hand, the TF-C-900 also displayed outstanding ORR catalytic activity in 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution (PBS) as electrolyte. Figure 7a and Figure S10 present the CV curves of the TF-C-900, the Bn-C-900 and the commercial Pt/C, respectively. All the catalysts exhibited distinct ORR peaks in  $\rm O_2$  saturated solution, suggesting catalytic activities toward ORR in PBS solutions. Among these catalysts, TF-C-900 displayed a cathodic peak centered at ca. 0.662 V (vs. RHE), which is more positive than that of Pt/C (0.641 V) in oxygen saturated PBS solution.

LSV measurements were also performed to evaluate the ORR activity of the prepared catalyst (Figure 7b-c). Remarkably, the TF-C-900 electrode exhibited an onset potential at 0.93 V, slightly smaller than that of Pt/C (0.98 V), while the half-wave potential (0.668 V) is more positive than that of commercial Pt/C (0.656 mV). Furthermore, the TF-C-900 electrode afforded a limiting current density of 5.23 mA cm $^{-2}$ . The K-L plots for TF-C-900 in the PBS solution, obtained from RDE polarization curves at different rotating speeds (Figure 7d and Figure S11c-d), presented nearly parallel fitting lines. Similar to the commercial Pt/C, the K-L plots of TF-C-900 also showed first-order reaction kinetics toward the concentration of  $O_2$  during the oxygen reduction process with a calculated electron transfer numbers (n) of 3.75 at 0.5 V.

**Figure 7.** Electrochemical performance of prepared multiple-doped catalysts in 0.1 M PBS. a) CV of TF-C-900 in 0.1 M PBS saturated with  $O_2$  at 1600 rpm with a sweep rate of 5 mV s<sup>-1</sup>; b) LSV curves of the prepared catalysts carbonized at 900 °C derived from different precursors at a rotation speed of 1600 rpm; c) LSV curves of TF-C-X series catalysts and commercial Pt/C at rotation speeds of 1600 rpm; d) K-L plots for TF-C-900 at various potential and the insert part is the polarization curve of TF-C-900 from 400 to 2500 rpm in  $O_2$ -saturated 0.1 M PBS solution; e) Percentage of hydrogen peroxide yield and the electron transfer number (n) of TF-C-X at different potentials; f) long-time stability comparison of TF-C-900 and the commercial Pt/C.

RRDE technology was also conducted to study the electron transfer number (n) and to detect the produced hydrogen peroxide yield in PBS solution. As shown in Figure 7e, the calculated electron transfer number for TF-C-900 was between 3.59 and 3.77 at the potentials ranging from 0.1 to 0.6 V, and the yield of  $H_2O_2$  generation is below 15.9 %, which again indicated four-electron pathway was dominated for ORR catalysis in PBS. The long-term stability of the TF-C-900 was evaluated via *i-t* tests by continuously recording the current in  $O_2$ -saturated PBS

solution at 0.5 V (vs. RHE). Compared with initial value, the current could maintain 87.8 % (78.7 for Pt/C) after 20000 s.

The outstanding electrocatalytic activity for ORR in both neutral and basic conditions for TF-C-900 might be attributed to the following effects. First, multiple dopants (electronegative N, S and Fe) were responsible for the high ORR activity, for which the charge of carbon could be redistributed by the synergistic effect of the doping sites. Secondly, the introduction of Fe is favourable for the carbonization, leading to a high graphitic degree and the coexistence of Fe/Fe<sub>3</sub>C that boost the catalytic activity.<sup>28</sup> Last but not least, the hierarchically porous structure and large surface areas of TF-C-900 offered effective diffusion channels for the transportation and penetration of oxygen and ions, realizing fast mass exchanges in the process of ORR.

Due to the excellent electrocatalytic performance toward ORR, Zn-air batteries were assembled by applying zinc foil as the anode and different TF-C-X as the air cathode. The power density and polarization curves of the Zn-air batteries were shown in Figure 8a. The open circuit voltage of Zn-air battery with TF-C-900 as the cathode catalyst reached 1.3 V and the maximum power density were determined as high as 243 mW cm<sup>-2</sup>, exceeding that of the Pt/C-based battery (210 mW cm<sup>-2</sup>) under identical conditions. Figure 8b presented the cycling galvanostatic discharge-charge curves at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. The TF-C-900 based battery delivered an initial charge potential of 2.16 V and discharge potential of 1.26 V (2.16 and 1.22 V for Pt/C based Zn-air battery), with a smaller voltage gap of 0.90 V than Pt/C (0.94 V). Furthermore, compared with Pt/C based battery, the TF-C-900 based Zn-air battery had a smaller chargedischarge voltage gap relative to the Pt/C based Zn-air battery. which keeps almost unchanged after 100 cycles, indicating a better cycling performance than that of Pt/C. As exemplified by Figure 8c-d, two batteries using TF-C-900 as air-cathode

connected in series are used to power an orange or green light emitting diode. Excellent stability was observed for at least 10 h without obvious brightness change. All these results further demonstrated the extraordinary ORR catalytic activity and stability of these POP derived electrocatalysts.

#### **Conclusions**

In summary, a porous ternary copolymer was synthesized and applied as precursor for preparation of multiple doped porous carbon composites, which exhibited high surface areas with hierarchical pores, tunable heteroatoms composition and abundant electroactive sites. The multiple doped carbon composites exhibited prominent catalytic activities toward ORR both in alkaline and neutral conditions with excellent long-term stability. Rechargeable Zn-air batteries were successfully fabricated using these POPs derived electrocatalysts as cathode materials, demonstrating its promising application in metal-air batteries. The ternary copolymerization strategy affords a new method for preparation of multiple doped ORR electrocatalysts derived from scalable porous organic polymers.

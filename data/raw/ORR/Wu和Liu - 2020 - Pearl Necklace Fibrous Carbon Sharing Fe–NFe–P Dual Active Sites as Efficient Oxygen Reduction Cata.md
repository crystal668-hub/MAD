# Pearl Necklace Fibrous Carbon Sharing Fe–N/Fe–P Dual Active Sites as Efficient Oxygen Reduction Catalyst in Broad Media and for Liquid/Solid-State Rechargeable Zn–Air Battery

Mengchen Wu and Rui Liu\*

Optimized catalysts are attractive from the standpoint of energy storage and conversion. Herein, a pearl necklace fibrous carbon catalyst with Fe–N/Fe–P dual active sites (Fe–P/NHCF) is fabricated via carbonization–phosphidation of metal–organic framework (MOF)/polyacrylonitrile nanofibers. Benefiting from Fe–N/Fe–P doping-induced active sites, accompanied by particular hierarchical porous merit and a 1D necklace network to facilitate the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), it exhibits a half-wave potential of 0.82 V in alkaline medium and outperforms commercial Pt/C in terms of stability in acid medium. Furthermore, a low voltage gap (1.04 V) is acquired in a liquid Zn–air battery with Fe–P/NHCF as the cathode. Meanwhile, the portable solid-state Zn–air battery displays an open circuit voltage of 1.32 V and a power density of 42 mW cm<sup>2</sup> . This strategy puts forward a protocol to develop tailored geometry with dual active sites for ORR in alkaline/acid media, which is expected to promote devices of practical significance.

### 1. Introduction

Browsing loads of unabated impetus gearing toward future energy landscape, Zn–air battery represents an ideal energy device. Yet, the hysteresis of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) seriously obstructs the advancement of this electrochemical technology.[1–3] Hitherto, platinum (Pt) surpasses majority of materials in the aspect of adorable catalytic activity while it is geologically rare and chemically susceptible.[4] For the replacement of Pt-based catalysts, substantive attention has been elicited from the optimization of carbon-based catalysts to the understanding of parameters controlling relative activities.[5,6] To maximize the catalytic efficiency, a rather crucial point of the matter is using the phenomenon of charge delocalization in carbon framework, in particular by introducing transition

metals into heteroatom-doped carbon systems.[7–11]

It is found that Fe–N is the most common active site, portraying the best ORR property. Although the activities of prevailing Fe–N/C catalysts are comparable to or even better than Pt/C catalyst in alkaline solution, they are still vulnerable in acidic medium.[12,13] Bearing somewhat similarity in chemical property, of note, a new category of Fe–P specie has recently demonstrated to possess high electrocatalytic activity for ORR and simultaneously shows a stable operation in both acidic and alkaline media.[14–17] For example, Razmjooei et al. prepared Fe- and P-functionalized catalyst with a uniform distribution of Fe–P active site on graphene, which would boost a 4e pathway for ORR in both alkaline and acidic electrolytes.[14] In this sce-

nario, fascination would be huge if highly oriented and spatially partitioned nanostructures could be designed in an integrative manner. Of note, complex 1D carbon with hierarchical nanostructure and porosity could provide additional channels for the diffusion of O2 and assist active sites to be fully exposed.[18–21] Wang and co-workers prepared a flexible porous carbon fiber through pyrolysis of electrospun polyimide, which exhibited bifunctional electrocatalytic performance for oxygen reduction and evolution reaction.[22]

Integrating the foregoing merits (unique Fe–P/Fe–N active composition and 1D exquisite architecture), herein, we utilized electrospinning technique to precisely control the morphology and thus prepared necklace-like structure with elegantly designed Fe–N/Fe–P active sites from carbonization–phosphidation strategy. Specifically, features of metal–organic framework (MOF)-derived catalysts, e.g., the high specific surface area, intrinsic porosity, and substantial N content, have been reasonably exploited in this trend.[23,24] Being confined in certain space, the metals freed from aggregation during the evolution into Fe–N–C catalyst under high temperature. Moreover, performance for ORR has been perfected with the mutual interacting between polymer matrix and incorporated MOFs as the preservation of the edges of pristine polyhedron and hierarchical property could be found.[25–27] Of huge significance, with the second incorporation of Fe–P during phosphidation, it performed more pronounced catalytic performance and durability in acidic and

alkaline media and could serve as air cathode for a handmade liquid/solid-state Zn-air battery.

#### 2. Results and Discussion

As shown in **Figure 1**, pearl necklace fiber (Zn/Fe ZIF-polyacrylonitrile [PAN]) was first fabricated via coelectrospinning, followed by carbonization–phosphidation to give rise to Fe–P/NHCF. Zn/Fe ZIF nanocrystals showed dodecahedral shape with the size of around 200 nm (**Figure 2a**). [28,29] Due to the precise optimization of ZIF/PAN ratio, solution viscosity, and electrospinning conditions, ZIF nanocrystals were uniformly distributed in the fibrous strings, portraying the necklace

structure (Figure 2b and Figure S1e, Supporting Information). [30,31] To couple highly ORR active Fe-N and Fe-P sites onto the distinctive structure in Fe-P/NHCF, carbonization and phosphidation were conducted in sequence. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image in Figure 2e intuitively shows the necklace-like network in Fe-P/NHCF. For comparison, pure N-doped carbon nanofiber (NCF) and only Fe-N-doped hollow carbon nanofiber (Fe-NHCF) were prepared. Interestingly, there was an engaging feature in the evolution of structure. Without the incorporation of ZIFs, electrospun PAN fibers showed smooth surface and retained the intact morphology after carbonization (Figure S1a,b, Supporting Information). Obvious protuberances and hollow cavities appeared in Fe-NHCF ascribing to the mutual interacting with polymer matrix (Figure S1c, Supporting Information).<sup>[25]</sup> In the subsequent phosphidation, negligible change of morphology was discerned between Fe-P/NHCF and Fe-NHCF (Figure 2d and Figure S1c, Supporting Information). High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of Fe-P/NHCF in Figure S2a, Supporting Information, validated that amorphous carbon dominated in the whole network. In addition, TEM images in Figure 2c clearly show that the direct carbonization of ZIF led to solid carbon nanoparticles. SEM elemental mapping of Fe-P/NHCF in Figure 2f explicitly signified the distribution

of C, O, N, P, and Fe elements. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns (Figure S3a, Supporting Information) indicated that the Fe–P/NHCF sample majorly consisted of amorphous carbon (at around 26°) and minor crystalline moieties (at around 44°). Here we have taken advantages of coelectrospun and carbonization–phosphidation to maximize the efficiency of the catalyst by the success in constructing hollow structure and introducing Fe, N, and P elements.

Parameters about porous properties of these materials are shown in **Figure 3**a. In N<sub>2</sub> sorption isotherms, a rapid nitrogen uptake at P/P<sub>0</sub> > 0.9 in Fe–P/NHCF and Fe–NHCF indicated the presence of macropores from hollow voids. Brunauer–Emmett–Teller-specific surface area ( $S_{\rm BET}$ ) of NCF, Fe–NC, and Fe–P/NHCF was calculated by 41, 751, and 237 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. The obvious enlarged surface area in Fe–NC and Fe–P/NHCF might come from the inherit of porosity of ZIF-derived carbon. After combining with the results of pore size distribution, we speculated that in Fe–P/NHCF, the mutual reaction of PAN matrix and parent ZIF nanoparticles as well as the following phosphidation resulted in the collapse of small pores. The properties of the second surface with the general belief, it therefore

indicated that the synthesized catalyst afford the characteristics of hierarchical porosity to facilitate electron and transporting relative species during reaction process. [35–37] In the result of X-rav photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Fe-P/NHCF showed the coexistence of Fe, N, C, P, and O elements (Figure S3b,c, Supporting Information). High-resolution N 1s spectrum of Fe-P/NHCF in Figure 3b had three main peaks, namely, pyridinic N (398.6 eV), graphitic N (401.3 eV), and oxidized N (402-405 eV). [38] Highresolution Fe 2p spectrum for Fe-P/NHCF (Figure 3c) showed peaks around 711 and 713 eV ascribing to Fe 2p 3/2 and 725.2 eV ascribing to Fe 2p 1/2 of Fe (III) and Fe (II) ions. A satellite peak at 718.7 eV also indicated the coexistence of Fe (II) and Fe (III) species. It was noteworthy that the peak around 708 eV attributed to zero-valence metallic or iron carbide; however, its weak intensity hinted of negligible existence for aggregated metallic Fe while an evolution of Fe-Nx active site by the carbon matrix.[39-41] In addition, the high-resolution P 2p spectrum (Figure 3d) was fitted into a major peak of P-O and a weak signal for Fe-P. [14,15] Given the analysis of TEM, XRD, and XPS, we concluded that Fe existed in the most possible form of Fe-N and Fe-P in Fe-P/NHCF.

ORR activity of the as-obtained catalysts was first scrutinized in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte. O2 was saturated during the whole experiment. Figure 4a shows cyclic voltammogram (CV) measurement. A reduction signal at 0.89 V was observed for Fe-P/NHCF, as positive as commercial Pt/C. This helped to believe Fe-P/NHCF owned an ORR activity similar to that of Pt/C. Next, to probe into the electrochemical performance, we gave another comparative sample N/PHCF, which was free of metal site (Figure S2b, Supporting Information). Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was conducted on all four samples (NCF, N/PHCF, Fe-NHCF, and Fe-P/NHCF). In Figure 4b, the onset potential  $(E_0)$  and half-wave potential  $(E_{1/2})$  of Fe-P/NHCF  $(E_0 = 0.9 \text{ V} \text{ and } E_{1/2} = 0.82 \text{ V})$  were significantly superior to NCNF ( $E_0 = 0.88 \text{ V}$  and  $E_{1/2} = 0.72 \text{ V}$ ), N/PHCF ( $E_0 = 0.86 \text{ V}$  and  $E_{1/2} = 0.76 \text{ V}$ ), and Fe-NHCF ( $E_0 = 0.89 \text{ V}$  and  $E_{1/2} = 0.77 \text{ V}$ ), which were close to Pt/C ( $E_0 = 0.91 \text{ V}$  and  $E_{1/2} = 0.79 \text{ V}$ ). Meanwhile, Fe-P/NHCF also performed a larger limiting current density (4.9 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>) than NCNF (3 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>), N/PHCF  $(4.8 \,\mathrm{mA \, cm^{-2}})$ , and Fe-NHCF  $(4.6 \,\mathrm{mA \, cm^{-2}})$ . These data demonstrated that the coexistence of Fe-P and Fe-N sites were crucially important for superior ORR kinetics. The number of

involved per O<sub>2</sub> for Fe–P/NHCF was calculated out to be 3.8 based on Equation (1) and (2), implying that the ORR process was dominated by a four-electron pathway (Figure S4a, Supporting Information and Figure 4c). To glean more superiority of our catalyst, especially the ability for guaranteeing long-term operation in practical device, chronoamperometric analysis was tested for Fe–P/NHCF and 20 wt% Pt/C (Figure 4d). Evidently, under the same circumstance, Pt/C sustained a current loss of 30% while only 12% of current decreased in the case of Fe–P/NHCF after continuously running for 12 h. On account of the catalytic activity of Pt/C is vulnerably subjected to methanol poison, tolerance was also evaluated between Fe–P/NHCF and Pt/C. Figure S5a, Supporting Information, shows that current density changed slightly in Fe–P/NHCF after injecting methanol into the electrolyte, while commercial Pt/C catalyst decayed seriously.

Casting about for better economic benefit drove us to estimate the credibility of Fe–P/NHCF in acidic condition as well. Thus, ORR activity was also probed in  $0.5~\text{M}~\text{H}_2\text{SO}_4$ . [42,43] As shown in **Figure 5**a, CV test was conducted for Fe–P/NHCF and Pt/C. A definable peak around 0.81~V was observed in Fe–P/NHCF, illustrating a reasonable activity in acidic medium that was

similar to that of Pt/C catalyst (0.82 V). Figure 5b shows LSV results of all catalysts measured in acidic electrolyte. Fe–P/NHCF owned a half-wave potential of 0.78 V and its limiting current density of 5.2 mA cm $^{-2}$ , featuring the most excellent one among our samples. LSV curves of the as-prepared Fe–P/NHCF catalyst obtained at different rotation speeds are shown in Figure S4b, Supporting Information. The number of transferred electrons calculated from the slope of the linear K–L plots was close to 4 ( $n\approx3.9$ ) (Figure 5c). Likewise, under chronoamperometric test, Fe–P/NHCF exhibited a long-term stability with 82% (<68% for commercial Pt/C) retention of current after 20 h (Figure S5b, Supporting Information). It can be found that the stable Fe–P bond and high structure stability could offer enhanced electrocatalytic stability for this Fe- and P-functionalized necklace network.

The variation in ORR catalytic properties for these catalysts, in aspects of onset and half-wave potentials in alkaline and acidic media, was systematically elucidated. On balance, ORR activity

of Fe-P/NHCF was appreciably improved in comparison with that of Fe-P free and Fe-free N-doped counterparts. To help understand the difference between Fe-P/NHCF and Pt/C, we put Figure 5d to make it more intuitive. The performance of Fe-P/NHCF could be correlated with 1) the evolution of two species of electrochemically active sites (Fe-N and Fe-P), originating from the intimate interaction between Fe-doped ZIF and P source, and 2) hierarchical architecture built from the mutual interaction between PAN matrix and parent ZIF under particular temperature. In addition, we made comparison with ORR catalytic activity and Zn-air battery between Fe-P/NHCF and other similar electrocatalysts (Table S1and S2, Supporting Information).

All the aforementioned results signified that Fe–P/NHCF could potentially work as an advanced cathode for Zn–air battery. Using a zinc flake as the anode, carbon paper loaded with catalyst as the cathode and  $6\,\mathrm{M}$  KOH containing  $0.2\,\mathrm{M}$  zinc acetate as the liquid electrolyte (**Figure 6**a).

Zn-air battery output an open-circuit potential of 1.47 V (Figure S6a, Supporting Information). Figure 6b shows the polarization and power density curve for the liquid Zn-air battery applied with Fe-P/NHCF or Pt/C. The discharge current density obtained from Fe-P/NHCF catalyst was 63 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, and the peak power density was 61 mW cm<sup>-2</sup>. Indeed, it rivaled Pt/C benchmark catalyst with the result of 62 and 42 mW cm<sup>-2</sup>. A galvanostatic recurrent pulse test was thus conducted to probe the recharge ability of the assembled battery with Fe-P/NHCF. When continuously carried on at  $5 \text{ mA cm}^{-2}$  for 250 cycles with a cycling period of 10 min (Figure 6c), it showed that the voltage gap slightly increased by 0.12 V (from 1.04 to 1.16 V). Despite that Zn was being continuously consumed in the operation, we could manually "recharge" the battery by substituting the Zn flake and refilling the fresh electrolyte to ensure its sustainability. In Figure 6d, a galvanostatic discharge examination for Fe-P/NHCF was examined under 5 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, the voltage was subjected to a slight decrease after a long period. The acquired results hinted that the present stability of the Fe-P/NHCF electrode could enable long-term work, which was then exemplified by powering a light-emitting diode (LED 3 V) using two series connected Zn-air battery applied with Fe-P/NHCF. There was no perceptible change in brightness after powering for 12 h (Figure S6b,c, Supporting Information).

We further constructed a rechargeable solid-state Zn-air battery using Fe–P/NHCF directly as the binder-free air electrode. The illustration of fabrication is shown in Figure 6e. The handmade Zn-air battery could operate smoothly with an open-circuit voltage of 1.32 V (Figure S7, Supporting Information). Figure 6f shows the demonstration of two linked solid-state Zn-air batteries powering a LED (2.0 V). The discharge polarization curve is shown in Figure 6f. Even applied in a solid-state battery, Fe-P/ NHCF still can provide a maximum peak power density of 41 mW cm<sup>-2</sup>. Cyclic stability of the assembled battery was tested under a current density of 1 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> (Figure 6g). The result revealed that after 40 discharge/charge cycles (20 min for each cycle), the discharging potential was 1.2 V, and the charging potential was 2.6 V, well approaching to the initial values. In addition, Figure 6h shows the discharge curve of this fabricated solid battery at a constant current density of 1 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, which showed a voltage plateau of  $\approx 1.3 \, \text{V}$ .

#### 3. Conclusions

In summary, this study presented a strategy of properly building necklace-like fibrous architecture with hierarchical porosity and dual active sites (e.g., Fe–P and Fe–N). As explored, it delivered a half-wave potential parallel to commercial 20 wt% Pt/C in alkaline medium. In the meanwhile, it exhibited better stability than Pt/C in acid medium. Consequently, the Fe–P/NHCF-equipped liquid Zn–air battery could output larger peak power density (61 mW cm<sup>-2</sup>) than Pt/C. Moreover, when assembled in a solid-state, Fe–P/NHCF still helped to display a high open circuit voltage (1.32 V) and a power density of 41 mW cm<sup>-2</sup>. This novel method would intrigue interest to construct air electrode with new geometry that can meet the challenge for efficient electrochemical energy technology.

#### 4. Experimental Section

Synthesis of Samples: In the synthesis of Zn/Fe ZIF, Zn(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>·6H<sub>2</sub>O (3.39 g) and Fe(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>·9H<sub>2</sub>O (100 mg) were dissolved in 600 mL methanol. The other 600 mL methanol solution contained 2-methylimidazole (3.94 g). Then two solutions were mixed carefully and kept stirring at 60 °C for 24 h. The products were collected by centrifugation and dried at 60 °C in vacuum. [28] For comparison, Zn–ZIF was synthesized without the addition of Fe source. Then 0.220 g of Zn/Fe ZIF or Zn-ZIF powder and 0.220 g of PAN were dissolved in 2 mL DMF. The mixture was constantly stirred for about 24 h at room temperature. In the course of electrospinning, the parameters (including voltage, injection velocity, and relative distance) were set as follows: 15 kV, 10  $\mu$ L min<sup>-1</sup>, and 13 cm, respectively. The as-prepared fibers were heated at 900 °C for 3 h under flowing argon, which was then named as Fe-NHCF and NHCF. In contrast, NCF was obtained following the same procedure except for the absence of ZIF. For synthesizing Fe-P/NHCF or N/PHCF, 1.0 g of sodium hypophosphite monohydrate was put at the upstream site while 100 mg of Fe-NHCF or NHCF at the downstream in the tubular furnace, which were heated at 300 °C for 2 h under flowing argon. [29]

Physical Characterization of Material: TEM was conducted on JEOLJEM-2100F instrument. XPS was performed on VG Thermo ESCALAB 250 (VG Scientific). XRD was recorded by Bruker D8 Advance X-ray powder diffractometer. Nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms were tested on Micromeritics Tristar 3020 analyser at 77 K.

*Electrochemical Test*: Relative electrochemical properties were tested on CHI760E workstation. The prepared electrolyte included alkaline (0.1 m KOH) and acidic (0.5 m H $_2$ SO $_4$ ) solution. The three-electrode system was made up of a platinum wire, Ag/AgCl reference electrode, and a rotating disk electrode (0.1962 cm $^2$ ). About 5 mg catalyst was dispersed in a mixture of 625 μL isopropanol and 15 μL Nafion, which was further sonicated for more than 1 h to give rise the catalyst ink. Yet, the loading of as-prepared catalysts and Pt/C on working electrode was 0.36 and 0.1 mg cm $^{-2}$ . Electrode potentials in reference to Ag/AgCl electrode were calibrated to reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE),  $E_{\rm (RHE)} = E_{\rm (Ag/AgCl)} + 0.059 \times {\rm pH} + 0.1971$ ; the scan rate in the test was all kept at 10 mV s $^{-1}$ . The following Koutecky–Levich equation was used to calculate the relevant transferred electron number (n)

$$\frac{1}{J} = \frac{1}{J_{K}} + \frac{1}{J_{L}} = \frac{1}{J_{K}} + \frac{1}{B\omega^{1/2}}$$

Details of Rechargeable Zn-Air Battery: On one hand, in the aqueous Zn-air battery, 10 mg catalyst was loaded on a carbon paper with a surface area of 3.14 cm<sup>2</sup>, which was used as air electrode. Polished Zn foil was used as anode and the electrolyte was 6 M KOH mixed with 0.2 M zinc acetate. The electrolyte was purged with high-purity O2 at the side of air electrode during testing. The galvanostatic cycling was conducted on LAND system. The cycle test was characterized with a pulse of 10 min at 5 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. On the other hand, a solid-state Zn-air battery was constructed into a sandwich structure. Specifically, the final catalyst and Zn foil acted as self-supported cathode and anode, respectively. The solid electrolyte was polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) gel. Details of the preparation of the gel: a mixture of 1 g of PVA and 10 mL of deionized water was kept stirring for 2 h at 95  $^{\circ}$ C. After that 1.0 mL of KOH (18 M) containing zinc acetate (0.1M) was added and the solution was kept stirring at 95 °C for another 40 min. The obtained transparent gel was kept at -3 °C overnight and should be thawed under room temperature before use. A polished Zn foil (1 cm  $\times$  3 cm) was attached carefully to the one side of the gel electrolyte, whereas the electrospun carbon fiber (1 cm  $\times$  1 cm) was directly attached to the other side of the gel. After that a piece of Ni foam was applied as current collector outside the carbon nanofiber. Finally, a section of cellulose tape assisted to seal the battery. The cycling test was performed at a current density of  $1\,\mathrm{mA\,cm^{-2}}$  with a discharge time of 10 min followed by a charge time of 10 min for every cycle.

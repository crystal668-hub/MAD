**While bimetallic 2D metallic nanomaterials are widely synthesized and used as electrocatalysts with enhanced performance, trimetallic 2D structures are less commonly reported. In this work, a facile wet chemical method for synthesizing Pd nanosheets and PdPtNi trimetallic alloy nanosheets is developed. Without the introduction of gaseous CO and pressurized equipment, Pd nanosheets with a thickness of ≈2.85 nm and sizes in the range of 1–2 µm can be obtained. The facile synthesis conditions allow for a comprehensive study of the nanosheet growth mechanism. It is found that 2D growth is closely related to the product of solvent decomposition and the additive ligand diethylenetriamine. Further, by depositing Pt and Ni onto the Pd nanosheets, trimetallic nanosheets with tunable compositions can be obtained and applied as oxygen reduction reaction electrocatalysts. Typically, the Pd9Pt1Ni1 nanosheets have the highest half-wave potential of 0.928 V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode), which is 34 mV higher than that of commercial Pt/C and 28 mV higher than that of Pd/C, and also have high durability.**

# **1. Introduction**

Pt and Pd are to be the most effective electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline media. However, their scarce earth-abundance and the resulting high price act as a bottleneck that restricts their application range. Developing Pt- and Pd-based catalysts with improved activity and stability is an effective strategy to reduce the cost of ORR catalysts.[1,2]

Anisotropic 2D nanostructures with high surface-to-volume ratios and large exposed catalytic active sites have attracted increasing interest in the field of catalysis.[3–9] Compared to the 0D and 1D nanostructures, 2D nanostructures have an increased contact area with the supporting materials, which enhances electron transfer on the catalyst surface and facilitates binding between the catalyst and supports, leading to increased catalytic activity and stability.[1,10] As a result, a lot of 2D Ptand Pd-based 2D nanocatalysts had been developed, including

Pd nanosheets,[11] the derivative PdCu nanosheets,[12] PtPb/Pt nanoplates,[13] and PtPdM (M = Ni, Co, and Fe) nanosheets.[1]

Another strategy to improve the activity and stability of catalysts in electrocatalytic reactions is to form alloys;[14–17] and alloying with non-noble metals may help reduce the cost of the catalyst further.[18–21] Compared to the well-studied bimetallic alloys, trimetallic alloys can possess a more complex alloy lattice that has better reactivity and stability, and the extra composition could further fine-tune the properties of the catalyst.[18,22–24] For instance, Xiong et al. reported a PtFeCo trimetallic tristar nanostructure with enhanced hydrogen evolution reaction activity.[23] The addition of Fe and Co lowered the d-band center of Pt, enhanced the reaction activity and reduced the cost of the catalyst. Other reported trimetallic cata-

lysts include the PtCuCo hollow nanospheres,[25] PtPdNi nanocages,[26] and PtNiAu alloy nanostructures.[27]

Previously, our group reported a solvothermal synthesis of Pd-Pt alloy nanosheets.[8] Herein, we further developed a wet chemical method to synthesize wrinkled ultrathin Pd and PdPtNi trimetallic nanosheets. Because of facile reaction conditions, the reaction process and formation mechanism of the ultrathin Pd nanosheets were comprehensively studied. It was found that the degree of wrinkling increased with the increase in temperature and the progress of reaction, and the CO formed in situ by the decomposition of the solvent *N,N*dimethylformamide (DMF) is responsible for 2D growth. Trimetallic PdPtNi nanosheets were obtained by depositing Pt and Ni onto the Pd nanosheets, with the atomic composition of the PdPtNi nanosheets readily adjusted by the molar ratio of the precursors. The ORR catalytic performance of the nanosheets was demonstrated. Among all the nanosheets, the Pd9Pt1Ni1 nanosheets showed the highest half-potential of 0.928 V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)). The nanosheets also exhibited improved stability, with the half-potential shifted negatively only by 10.6 mV after 10 000 cycles.

# **2. Results and Discussion**

Pd nanosheets were synthesized by using a facile wet chemical method. Typically, 4.5 mg Na2PdCl4 was first dissolved in 6 mL of DMF and 4 mL of ethylene glycol (EG), followed by **www.advancedsciencenews.com**

the addition of 1 g KOH. The mixture was sonicated to obtain a transparent solution before adding 5 mL of diethylenetriamine (DETA). The evenly mixed solution was then incubated in an oil bath at 150 °C for 1 h. The color of the mixture changed gradually from colorless to a greyish hue, and then formed black precipitates, signifying the formation of Pd nanosheets.

**Figure 1** shows the typical morphology of the as-prepared Pd nanosheets. As revealed by the scanning electron microscopy (SEM), all the Pd nanosheets have irregular shapes, wrinkled morphology, and sizes ranging from 1 to 2 µm (Figure 1a). The magnified SEM image shows that all these nanosheets have smooth surfaces (Figure 1b). The irregular shape and its wrinkled morphology can be further illustrated by the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image (Figure 1d,e), where the nanosheets appear bent and folded. The thickness of the Pd nanosheets was characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM) at 2.85 nm (Figure 1g,h). The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) image (Figure 1f) of the Pd nanosheets shows a ring pattern, indicating its polycrystalline nature. The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image (Figure 1c) shows that the Pd nanosheets are composed of various grains with clear interplanar spacing of 0.224 nm, which corresponds to the Pd (111) planes. In addition, a lattice spacing of 0.236 nm was observed, which is 1/3 (422) fringes that are characteristic of 2D nanostructures.[12,28] The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern (Figure S1, Supporting Information) confirms that the nanosheets have a face-centered cubic (*fcc*) structure (JCPDS no. 46-1043).

From the trapped reaction intermediates, it was found that both the size and degree of wrinkling of the nanosheets increased as the reaction proceeded. After heating in a 150 °C oil bath for 1 min, the reaction mixture became grayish in color, and ultrathin nanosheets with few wrinkles could be isolated (**Figure 2**a). As the reaction time increased to 2 and

5 min, the size of the isolated nanosheets increased and more wrinkles emerged. This correlation suggests that the wrinkled nanosheets were not transformed from the flat nanosheets,[29] but rather the result of mismatched growth originated from the fast reduction and heterogeneous nucleation process.

The reaction temperature, which would have a significant effect on the reduction and deposition kinetics, also has a remarkable effect on the nanosheet morphology. As the reaction temperature decreased from 150 to 120 °C, the sample obtained after 5 min was much less wrinkled (Figure S2, Supporting Information). It seems that the slow reduction promoted the expansion of the nanosheets and prevented the formation of mismatched grains. However, a further decrease in the reaction temperature did not lead to the formation of flat nanosheets. At 80 °C, only aggregates of nanoparticles could be obtained, and a mixture of nanoparticles and small nanoplate pieces was obtained at 90 °C (Figure S3, Supporting Information). Although the reaction kinetics could be slowed, 2D growth was also compromised at these low-temperature conditions.

The fact that the nanosheets could not be formed at temperatures below 100 °C indicates that some critical processes inducing 2D growth occurred only at high temperatures. Among all the ingredients, DMF is known to decompose and produce gaseous dimethylamine (DMA) and CO at elevated temperatures under basic condition.[30,31] Thus, it is highly plausible that one or more DMF derivatives induced 2D growth of Pd.

We then carried out control experiments to investigate which one of decomposed products of DMF was responsible for the growth of nanosheets. When DMF was replaced with formaldehyde solution, which also produces CO upon heating, large Pd nanoparticles and a few nanoplates were obtained (Figure S4, Supporting Information). Moreover, bubbling CO gas into the reaction mixture without DMF and KOH also yielded nanosheets (Figure S5, Supporting Information). In contrast, bubbling DMA into the DMF and KOH-free reaction mixture could only give aggregates of nanoparticles (Figure S6, Supporting Information). These control experiments indicate that CO rather than DMA is more likely to be the morphological controlling reagent that regulates 2D growth in this synthesis. This is also in good agreement with the literature that CO is a well-known ligand that renders the Pd (111) facets and facilitates the formation of 2D Pd nanostructures.[11,28,29]

Additional control experiments also indicated that both DMF and KOH affected nanosheet formation. As the amount of DMF decreased from 5 to 4 mL and then to 1 mL, the nanosheets became increasingly wrinkled, and eventually broke down into aggregates of small particles when DMF was not added (Figure S7, Supporting Information). Obviously, lower the DMF, weaker the ligand control. Similarly, the amount of KOH directly influenced the decomposition process of DMF and the amount of CO and DMA produced. Without KOH, no bubbles were observed even at 150 °C and DMF did not decompose at all (Figure S8, Supporting Information). The reduction and **www.advancedsciencenews.com**

deposition of Pd proceeded without ligand regulation, yielding aggregates of large nanoparticles.

The diamine ligand DETA is also critical for the formation of nanosheets. In absence of DETA, only small nanoparticles were obtained. When more DETA was added, the nanosheets became larger and smoother (Figure S9, Supporting Information). In our previous solvothermal synthesis of PdPt nanosheets, we showed that DETA was able to coordinate with Pd (II) and Pt (IV), reducing the redox potentials and slowing down the metal reduction rate.[8] In this study, DETA most likely had the same effect. Similar to lowering the temperature, the addition of DETA slowed down the reaction kinetics, allowing the controlled deposition of Pd at the edge of the nanosheets under the regulation of CO and the gradual expansion of the nanosheets. In the absence of DETA, the fast reduction of Pd at a given temperature would result in burst homogenous nucleation and yield only Pd nanoparticles.

Further, the PdPtNi nanosheets were formed by deposition of Pt and Ni onto the existing Pd nanosheets. To achieve uniform deposition, the Pd nanosheet must be washed thoroughly to remove excess ligands and KOH. Among the common reducing agents, hydrazine was employed as the reductant to reduce Ni under ambient conditions. Pt(acac)2 and Ni(acac)2 were used as metal precursors. Replacing them with H2PtCl6 and NiCl2 led to the formation of PtNi nanoparticles on the Pd nanosheets, probably because the reduction kinetics and the nucleation process of the metals were greatly affected by the metal precursors (Figure S10, Supporting Information). The atomic ratio of the trimetallic nanosheets could be tuned by adjusting the amount of Pt and Ni precursors. Moreover, an insufficient amount of hydrazine caused reduction in the yield of Pt and Ni, lowering the atomic ratio of Pt and Ni in the trimetallic alloy (Figure S11, Supporting Information).

The PdPtNi nanosheets with various atomic ratios, as determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy, have almost the same morphologies under the SEM and TEM characterizations (**Figure 3**; Figure S12, Supporting Information). The EDS mapping results demonstrated that Pt and Ni are uniformly distributed over the Pd nanosheets (Figure 3e). The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results of the typical Pd9Pt1Ni1 nanosheets confirm the existence of Pt and Ni elements, and suggest that all three elements were partially oxidized (Figure S13, Supporting Information). The crystalline structure of PdPtNi nanosheets was further characterized by XRD, and the result obtained (Figure 3f) shows that all the nanosheets have an *fcc* lattice and the pattern of alloy; with the (111), (200), and (220) peaks located between those of pure metallic Pd (JCPDS no. 46-1043), Pt (JCPDS no. 4-802), and Ni (JCPDS no. 4-850). Moreover, as the composition of Pt and Ni increased, the diffraction peaks shifted to larger angles as Ni had the relatively low lattice constant. From the HRTEM image of Pd9Pt1Ni1 nanosheets (Figure 3c), two types of lattice fringes

can be observed: a lattice spacing of 0.224 nm corresponding to the (111) planes of the *fcc* PdPtNi nanosheets, and a rare lattice spacing of 0.306 nm, which is the (100) facet of PdO.

The Pd and PdPtNi trimetallic nanosheets exhibited enhanced electrocatalytic performance toward the ORR under basic condition. The ORR polarization curves of various catalysts were recorded in O2-saturated 0.1 m KOH aqueous solution at a scan rate of 10 mV s–1. From **Figure 4**a, it can be observed that both the onset potential and half-wave potential of Pd nanosheets are more positive than those of commercial Pt/C and Pd/C. The half-wave potential of the Pd nanosheets reached 0.926 V (vs RHE), which was 32 mV higher than that of Pt/C (0.894 V vs RHE). The enhanced catalytic performance of the nanosheets can be attributed to the wrinkled

and ultrathin morphologies, and the polycrystalline nature, which offers more active sites. Among all the trimetallic nanosheets, the Pd<sub>9</sub>Pt<sub>1</sub>Ni<sub>1</sub> nanosheet exhibited an even higher half-wave potential of 0.928 V (vs RHE), 34 mV higher than that of Pt/C, and 28 mV higher than that of Pd/C (0.90 V vs RHE). However, a further increase in the Pt and Ni composition led to reduction in the catalytic performance of the trimetallic nanosheets. The Pd<sub>2.4</sub>Pt<sub>1</sub>Ni<sub>1</sub> nanosheets have only comparable onset and half-wave potentials to those of commercial Pt/C. Moreover, the one with insufficient Pt and Ni also had compromised performance (Figure S14, Supporting Information). Apparently, depositing a moderate amount of Pt and Ni and forming a PdPtNi trimetallic alloy can help increase the ORR catalytic activity. The mass activity (MA, in terms of all metal) of the PdoPt1Ni1 trimetallic nanosheets was calculated to be 0.29 A mg<sup>-1</sup>, which was 2.9 times higher than that of Pt/C (0.1 A mg<sup>-1</sup>) and 2.4 times of Pd/C (0.12 A mg<sup>-1</sup>). The specific activity of the Pd<sub>9</sub>Pt<sub>1</sub>Ni<sub>1</sub> nanosheets was 1.22 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, which was 7 and 4.9 times higher than those of Pt/C (0.175 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>) and Pd/C (0.25 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>), respectively (Figure 4b).

To characterize the stability of the catalysts, accelerated durability tests (ADT) were carried out by cycling the potential between 0.6 and 1.0 V (vs RHE) at a sweep rate of 200 mV s<sup>-1</sup> in an O<sub>2</sub>-saturated 0.1 M KOH aqueous solution. As shown in Figure 4e,f, the half-wave potentials of Pd nanosheets and commercial Pt/C after the test negatively shifted by 20.9 and 19.5 mV, respectively, while the half-wave potential of Pd<sub>9</sub>Pt<sub>1</sub>Ni<sub>1</sub> trimetallic nanosheets was negatively shifted by only 10.6 mV (Figure 4d). Its MA was still the highest (Figure 4c), indicating better durability. After the ADT test, the Pt nanoparticles in Pt/C aggregated severely, while the morphologies of the nanosheets remained almost unchanged (Figure S15, Supporting Information). The composition of Pt decreased about 40% after the cycling process as determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The improved durability of the trimetallic nanosheets might be the effect of the wrinkled 2D morphology, which provided more connections with the carbon support and prevented aggregation during the electrochemical cvcles.[1,6,32]

In practical applications such as fuel cells, the anodic ORR process frequently interferes with carbonaceous intermediates such as CO, as the adsorption of these species may poison the catalyst. We also carried out the CO-stripping test in 0.5 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> solution to study the electrochemical active surface areas (ECSAs) as well as the CO adsorption ability of the catalysts (Figure S16, Supporting Information). The ECSAs of Pd nanosheets calculated according to CO-stripping were 31 m $^2$  g $^{-1}$ <sub>metal</sub>, much lower than those of commercial Pt/C  $(57 \text{ m}^2 \text{ g}^{-1}_{\text{metal}})$  and Pd/C  $(46.6 \text{ m}^2 \text{ g}^{-1}_{\text{metal}})$ . After depositing Pt and Ni, their affinity toward CO decreased further. The CO-stripping ECSA of the Pd<sub>9</sub>Pt<sub>1</sub>Ni<sub>1</sub> trimetallic nanosheets was only 23.8 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup><sub>metal</sub>. It is also noticed that the oxidation potential of CO gradually decreases as the composition of PtNi increases, suggesting that the trimetallic nanosheets can facilitate oxidation of CO at lower potentials. This indicates that CO and other carbon substances can be removed more easily from the trimetallic catalyst surface. In this sense, PdPtNi nanosheet catalysts are more tolerant to CO poisoning.

#### 3. Conclusion

In summary, we successfully synthesized ultrathin wrinkled Pd nanosheets using a facile wet chemical method. It can be concluded that the growth mechanism of the Pd nanosheets is due to the synergistic effect of the DMF decomposition product CO and the additive ligand DETA. The former confines the growth of Pd and induces 2D growth, while the latter helps adjust the reaction kinetics to prevent fast homogeneous nucleation and the formation of nanoparticle aggregates. Furthermore, PdPtNi trimetallic nanosheets with tunable compositions were obtained by depositing Pt and Ni onto the Pd nanosheets. Owing to ultrathin 2D morphology, the Pd and PdPtNi nanosheets have enhanced ORR catalytic activities. In particular, the PdoPt1Ni1 nanosheets exhibited the best onset potential and half-wave potential. It also has the lowest activity decay compared to the Pd nanosheets and commercial Pt/C after the long-term ADT test. This facile synthesis of nanosheets and related trimetallic nanostructures opens a new route for the development of functional nanomaterials.

The high cost and low stability of Pt-based oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts have limited their commercial applications. In this paper, we report the microwave synthesis of ultralow loading Ru-Mo<sub>2</sub>C on carbon nanotubes (CNT) as ORR catalysts to alleviate these above disadvantages. Ru-Mo<sub>2</sub>C@CNT exhibited excellent oxygen reduction reaction activity with a half-potential of 0.87 V and an onset potential of 0.94 V. It has high stability and palmary anti-methanol capability in alkaline electrolytes. This Ru-Mo<sub>2</sub>C@CNT may be a promising alternative to Pt-based electrocatalysts in energy conversion and storage. © 2022 The Electrochemical Society ("ECS").

With the increasing pressure from energy consumption levels and environmental issues, the development of sustainable energy and advanced energy storage devices is indispensable for society and science progress. <sup>1–4</sup> Proton exchange membrane fuel cells are considered to be the clean energy delivery devices of the future and generate electricity through electrochemical redox reactions. <sup>5–7</sup> Both cathodic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and anodic hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) occur on the surfaces of catalysts. ORR is a kinetically sluggish and critical half reaction in which the four electron reaction pathway is much more favored. <sup>8–10</sup> However, the disadvantages of Pt-based catalysts that limit their commercial application are high cost, scarcity, and lower stability. In recent years, considerable research has been carried out to replace the state-of-the-art noble metal catalysts with efficient transition metal based materials. <sup>11–15</sup>

Ruthenium (Ru) with its low cost and high activity has become one of the cheaper alternatives to Pt. 16,17 Molybdenum (Mo)based materials (MoS<sub>2</sub>, Mo<sub>2</sub>N, Mo<sub>2</sub>C, MoO<sub>2</sub>, and MoP) are also prospective ORR catalysts in many fields. <sup>18–22</sup> Previous studies have proven that Ru-Mo based electrocatalysts possessed excellent activities for ORR, CO2 reduction, methanol oxidation and hydrogen evolution reaction. <sup>23–28</sup> Unfortunately, the limited practical application of Ru-Mo based electrocatalysts has been a bottleneck due to their lower durability as they are prone to corrosion and aggregation. It has been shown that structuring the size and configuration of metal nanoparticles radically alters their electrocatalytic properties. <sup>29–32</sup> In general, metal nanoparticles with low loading and small particle size have superior electrocatalytic performance compared to larger metal nanoparticles, mainly for their ability to expose a large number of accessible surface active sites. 33 Nevertheless, numerous challenges remain in the preparation of stable ultralow loading nanoparticles, which is mainly due to their high surface energy, susceptibility to collapse and agglomeration. In this case, anchoring the nanoparticles on a suitable support is a proven method that fulfills the requirements for efficient and durable ORR catalysts. 34-36 Carbon nanotubes (CNT) have excellent electrical conductivity, chemical stability, mechanical strength and accessibility, making them ideal catalyst support materials. Besides, the large specific surface area of CNT support can promote the adsorption and dissociation of gas molecules, which accelerates the kinetics of gas participation in the reaction. Yang et al. prepared a catalyst (RuCoO<sub>x</sub>@Co/N-CNT) via decorating metallic cobalt nanoparticles embedded in N doped CNT with a ruthenium dopant and post-oxidizing treatment.<sup>37</sup> Additionally, CNT with transition metal species can form carbon-

Therefore, the rational design of ultralow loading, high activity and stability of Ru-Mo based metal carbon nanostructures catalysts is one of the key scientific issues to realized electrochemical energy conversion.

Herein, CNT with ultralow Ru- $Mo_2C$  loading has been synthesized via a simple, fast and solvent-free microwave pyrolysis method and achieved a high half-wave potential ( $E_{1/2}$ ) and high durability of 92.2% after 20000 s. During the synthesis process, CO is generated by the decomposition of carbonyl salts under the rapid action of microwave radiation, rapidly reducing metal ions to nanoparticles and has strong interaction with CNT support. A series of physical characterizations and experimental results show that Ru and  $Mo_2C$  form a Ru- $Mo_2C$  heterojunction, and bond with the carbon element on the carbon nanotube (CNT) to form a strong metal support interaction (SMSI),  $^{38}$  and the size of the formed heterojunction is only 2–3 nm, which improve the ORR performance and the structural stability.

#### Experimental

**Experimental materials.**—Molybdenumhexacarbonyl (Mo (CO)<sub>6</sub>, 98%) was bought from Aladdin, Triruthenium dodecacarbonyl (Ru<sub>3</sub>(CO)<sub>12</sub>, 98%) was purchased from Aladdin. Carbon nanotube was obtained from Shandong Dazhan Nanomaterial company.

*Preparation of Ru-Mo<sub>2</sub>C@CNT-X/Y and Ru-Mo<sub>2</sub>C@Vulcan X72.*—A series of catalysts with the Ru-Mo<sub>2</sub>C@CNT-X/Y, for which the ratio of Ru-Mo<sub>2</sub>C to CNT is 3:2, 1:1, 1:2, 1:3, 1:4, 1:5, were synthesized by the microwave synthesis, namely Ru-Mo<sub>2</sub>C@CNT-3/2, Ru-Mo<sub>2</sub>C@CNT-1/1, Ru-Mo<sub>2</sub>C@CNT-1/2, Ru-Mo<sub>2</sub>C@CNT-1/3, Ru-Mo<sub>2</sub>C@CNT-1/4, Ru-Mo<sub>2</sub>C@CNT-1/5. First, 40 mg of CNT, 5 mg Mo(CO)<sub>6</sub>, and 5 mg Ru<sub>3</sub>(CO)<sub>12</sub> were mixed and ground in a mortar to mix evenly. Then, the mixture was put into a quartz bottle and microwaved in a household microwave oven for 100 s. The CNT in the preparation of Ru-Mo<sub>2</sub>C@CNT-X/Y catalyst was directly replaced by Vulcan X72, and the same operation method was used for the remaining steps.

Characterization.—The morphology and chemical elements were measured by using a HITACHI SU8010 FESEM. The Hitachi (Tokyo, Japan) H-8100 TEM equipped with EDX equipment plays an important role in obtaining detailed structure information, and the SAED and HRTEM were also measured by the instrument. The X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) pattern and Raman scattering spectra of the products were recorded by using a Rigaku D-MAX 2500/PC X-ray diffractometer and micro-Raman spectrometer (Britain, Renishaw), respectively. The content of elements was

determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer (ICP-AES, Agilent 5110). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was tested by a thermogravimetric analyzer (Netzsch, Germany, TG-209F3) to measure metal content in catalysts.

**Electrochemical measurements.**—5 mg of the catalyst was dispersed in 0.5 ml of a mixed solution of ethyl alcohol, and 5% Nafion (V:V = 49:1), after sonication for 1 h, the different catalysts with the concentration of  $10 \text{ mg ml}^{-1}$  were obtained. The electrochemical tests were performed on an electrochemical workstation (CHI 760E, Shanghai Chenhua Instrument Co., Shanghai, China) at room temperature with 0.1 M KOH solution saturated with  $O_2$ . A platinum wire electrode was used as the counter electrode and a reference electrode as the saturated calomel electrode (SCE). A

glassy carbon electrode was used as the working electrode. Take  $10~\mu l$  of the mixed slurry and drop it evenly on the surface of the GCE. After it is naturally dried, further electrochemical tests are performed. All potentials reported in this work are corrected using reversible hydrogen electrodes (RHE). All polarization curves were corrected for 95% iR. All electrocatalyst tests including cyclic voltammetry (CV), and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV). The durability test was performed in 0.1 M KOH solution using chronoamperometry. The stability of ORR catalysts was characterized by the curves of i–t with testing for 20000 s. Methanol tolerance was assessed by i–t curves in  $\rm O_2$  saturated 0.1 M KOH solution with 3 M methanol. According to the LSV curves, the transferred electron number can be calculated by following the Koutecky-Levich equations.

### Results and Discussion

The synthesis procedure for Ru-Mo2C@CNT catalysts is presented in Scheme [1](#page-3-0). The Ru-Mo2C@CNT catalyst with a strong metal-support interaction can be synthesized by a simple microwave pyrolysis method in a household microwave oven using CNT as the carriers, Ru3(CO)12 and Mo(CO)6 as precursors.[40](#page-10-15) Compared with the samples prepared by traditional methods, the active material on CNT carriers is highly uniformly dispersed, the number of active sites is increased, and the ORR performance is enhanced.

The FESEM images of four samples, Ru-Mo2C@CNT-3/2, Ru-Mo2C@CNT-1/1, Ru-Mo2C@CNT-1/2, Ru-Mo2C@CNT-1/3, Ru-Mo2C@CNT-1/4, at different magnifications are presented in

Fig. [1.](#page-2-0) From Fig. [1,](#page-2-0) it can be seen that in different mixing ratios of metal and support, Ru-Mo2C is anchored on the CNT support, only the size and distribution status of the metal particles are different. Moreover, the size of Ru-Mo2C active material decreases with the increase of the proportion of carbon nanotubes, and the distribution is uniform. Further, the mixing ratio was increased to 1:4 (Ru-Mo2C@CNT-1/4), the images demonstrated a homogeneous dispersion of nanoparticles on the CNT with small particle size (This

will be characterized by the following TEM). The catalyst can accelerate the ORR, mainly as a result of the synergistic interaction among its surface active sites. Nevertheless, particles with larger particle sizes can generate unusually long reaction pathways, which can lead to undesirable transport and reaction resistance. Thus, it is necessary to select catalysts with small size nanoparticles that can shorten the reaction processes to speed up the reaction with better ORR performance.

To further investigate the structure of the Ru-Mo2C@CNT-1/4, the micromorphology and composition of Ru-Mo2C@CNT-1/4 are observed via TEM and HRTEM. Figure [2](#page-3-1)a exhibits that the Ru-Mo2C with an average size of 2.5 nm is uniformly anchored on the CNT. According to Fig. [2b](#page-3-1), it can be seen that the active materials anchored on the CNT form a carbon layer cladding under the action of microwave radiation, and it is preliminarily assumed that SMSI may be generated between the active material and the CNT support. The HRTEM images in Fig. [2c](#page-3-1) reveal the wellresolved lattice fringes between Ru and Mo2C with the spacing of 0.205 nm and 0.207 nm, corresponding to the (101) crystal plane of Ru and the (200) crystal plane of Mo2C, respectively, which were very consistent with the XRD results. Furthermore, it is clear from Fig. [2](#page-3-1) that the 0.34 nm face spacing corresponds to the (002) crystal plane of CNT. The results above indicate that typical heterojunction structures of Ru-Mo2C anchored on CNT are synthesized successfully. The SAED pattern in Fig. [2d](#page-3-1) further demonstrates the heterojunction structure of the Ru-Mo2C nanostructure. In addition, the EDX element mapping images (Fig. [2e](#page-3-1)) showed that Ru and Mo elements are uniformly distributed on the CNT.[39](#page-10-14)[,41](#page-10-16)

To obtain the actual Ru and Mo loading, TGA experiments were carried out in air. In the oxidation process, Mo2C in the Ru-Mo2C@CNT was supposed to convert completely into MoO3, CNT was oxidized into CO2, and Ru showed no significant reaction

<span id="page-6-0"></span>**Figure 8.** The plots of the current density vs the scan rate for Ru-Mo<sub>2</sub>C@CNT-X/Y (X/Y = 3/2, 1/1, 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 1/5).

in this temperature range. As shown in Fig. 3, the TGA curve of the Ru-Mo<sub>2</sub>C@CNT-1/4 demonstrated that the mass loading of metal on CNT was 19. 04 wt%, similarly, the mass loading of Ru-Mo<sub>2</sub>C@CNT-X/Y (X/Y = 3/2, 1/1, 1/2, 1/3, 1/5) samples were 55.16 wt%, 49.61 wt%, 26.66 wt%, 25.53 wt% and 13.89 wt%, respectively. The rapid loss of weight from 400 °C to 600 °C was attributed to the oxidation of CNT to CO<sub>2</sub>. From the TGA data, the actual loading was lower than the Ru-Mo calculated loading, which loss may be due to the evaporation of intermediates during the formation process. Moreover, the results of ICP-AES indicated that the actual element content of Ru and Mo were 62.4% and 37.6%, respectively, which better conformed to the EDS results.

Figure 4a represents XRD patterns of CNT powders and Ru-Mo<sub>2</sub>C@CNT. A comparison with the XRD pattern of CNT shows that Ru-Mo<sub>2</sub>C has been successfully anchored on the CNT. Among them, there are four obvious characteristic peaks at 37.7°,  $43.7^{\circ}$ ,  $63.4^{\circ}$ , and  $75.7^{\circ}$ , which correspond to the (111), (200), (220) and (311) crystal planes of Mo<sub>2</sub>C (PDF#15-0457) substances. The characteristic peaks at 38.4°, 42.2°, 44.0°, 58.3°, 69.4°, and 78.4° belong to the (100), (002), (101), (102), (110), and (103) crystal planes of Ru (PDF#06-0663), respectively. The XRD patterns are shown in Fig. 4b display the structure of the catalyst prepared at different mixing ratios. All samples exhibited diffraction peaks of Ru and Mo<sub>2</sub>C, indicating the decomposition of precursors, and the generation of Ru-Mo<sub>2</sub>C. The existence of smaller diffraction peaks in the XRD pattern of the Ru-Mo<sub>2</sub>C@CNT-3/2 Ru-Mo<sub>2</sub>C@CNT-1/1 indicates that the precursors have not completely decomposed and other products are generated. Moreover, with the increase in the proportion of CNT, the carbonyl compound can be completely decomposed to produce Ru-Mo<sub>2</sub>C. As the inset shows, the gradual trend of the diffraction peaks around 40-44 degrees to lower with the increasing of CNT proportion, demonstrating its poor crystallinity.

In addition, the Raman spectroscopy was performed to evaluate the extent of Ru-Mo<sub>2</sub>C@CNT defects at different mixing ratios. The defect/disordered carbon (D-peak) and graphite  $sp^{2-}$  carbon (G-peak) are located at  $1350~\rm cm^{-1}$  and  $1580~\rm cm^{-1}$ , respectively. The defect densities of the carbon material can be expressed by the intensity ratio of D band and the G band ( $I_D/I_G$ ). It can be seen from Fig. 5a that the  $I_D/I_G$  of the Ru-Mo<sub>2</sub>C@CNT-1/4 is 1.25, which was significantly higher than the intensity ratio of the other proportion. It was mainly due to the incorporation of Ru-Mo<sub>2</sub>C that caused stresses

in the carbon layer, which led to defects on the CNT, as manifested by the increase in the relative intensity of the D band. This facilitates the utilization of more active sites on the catalyst and enhanced the performance of ORR. The 2D band is attributed to the interlayer coupling. As shown in Fig. 5b, the relative strength of Ru-Mo<sub>2</sub>C@CNT-1/4 increased significantly compared to the pristine CNT, which indicates that the Ru-Mo<sub>2</sub>C are encapsulated on the outer wall of the CNT, and this may only affect the coupling of several surface layers without affecting the main body of the CNT.

Electrochemical tests were performed on six samples with different proportions in 0.1 M KOH solution, and we found that Ru-Mo<sub>2</sub>C@CNT-1/4 shows the most superior electrochemical performance. CV measurement is an effective way to represent the ORR efficiency of catalysts. CV curves of O2 saturated electrolyte in Fig. 6a show the distinct oxygen reduction peaks of all catalysts, and the potentials are in a decreasing order of 1:4 > 1:5 > 3:2 > 1:3 >1:2 > 1:1. The potential of oxygen reduction peak increases gradually with the decrease of the amount of Ru-Mo<sub>2</sub>C loading, which indicates that ORR is enhanced. This is mainly due to the fact that a smaller loading will result in a uniform dispersion on the carbon tubes and the increased active sites are fully utilized. CV tests of Ru-Mo<sub>2</sub>C@CNT were accomplished in O<sub>2</sub> and N<sub>2</sub> saturated 0.1 M KOH solution at a scan rate of 50 mV s<sup>-1</sup>. The results are shown in Fig. 6b. For CV curves of N<sub>2</sub> saturated electrolyte, there are no characteristic peaks that can symbolize the oxygen reduction reaction for catalysts, which indicates an excellent ORR activity for Ru-Mo<sub>2</sub>C@CNT-1/4.

In addition, the double-layer capacitance ( $C_{\rm dl}$ ) was used to further evaluate the electrochemical surface area (ECSA) of the material, which was calculated by measuring the CV curve in the potential range of 0.91 to 1.01 V (vs RHE, reversible hydrogen electrode) (Fig. 7). In 0.1 M KOH solution, the  $C_{\rm dl}$  of Ru-Mo<sub>2</sub>C@CNT-1/4 is 10.99 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>, which was much higher than Ru-Mo<sub>2</sub>C@CNT-3/2 (7.6 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>), Ru-Mo<sub>2</sub>C@CNT-1/1 (7.79 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>), Ru-Mo<sub>2</sub>C@CNT-1/2 (8.62 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>), Ru-Mo<sub>2</sub>C@CNT-1/3 (9.94 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>) and Ru-Mo<sub>2</sub>C@CNT-1/5 (8.1 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>)(Fig. 8), and this result was consistent with the conclusion drawn by the CV curve (Fig. 6). The experimental results revealed that the ultralow loaded Ru-Mo<sub>2</sub>C heterojunction was dispersed uniformly in the CNT and the increased active sites would be fully utilized, which was more favorable for ORR.

In order to see the effect of Ru-Mo<sub>2</sub>C loading amount on CNT to ORR activity, we compared the ORR activity of Ru-Mo<sub>2</sub>C@CNT catalysts by conducting linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) with a glassy carbon (GC) and rotating disk electrode (RDE). Figures 9a-9f shows LSV curves of Ru-Mo<sub>2</sub>C@CNT-X/Y (X/Y = 3/2, 1/1, 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 1/5) at different rotating speeds in O<sub>2</sub> saturated 0.1 M KOH solution. It is clear to see that the higher the speed, the greater the diffusion-limiting current. The results showed that the mixing ratio and speed are the factors to influence the ORR activity. Consistent with CV results, Ru-Mo<sub>2</sub>C@CNT-1/4 has superior test results to other samples. These LSV curves of Ru-Mo<sub>2</sub>C@CNT in O<sub>2</sub> saturated 0.1 M KOH solution with electrode rotation speed of 1600 rpm at a scan rate of 50 mV s<sup>-1</sup> are in comparison, as shown in Fig. 9g. Main electrochemical parameters are summarized in Fig. 9h, including diffusion-limiting current (I<sub>d</sub>), the half-wave potential (E<sub>1/2</sub>) and onset potential (E<sub>oneset</sub>). E<sub>1/2</sub> is an important parameter for the characterization of ORR performance. The variation trend of  $E_{1/2}$  is completely consistent with that of oxygen reduction peak potentials of CV curves. 42 The ratio amount was 1:4, the catalyst performed the best catalytic effect with a  $E_{1/2}$  of 0.87 V. The excellent oxygen reduction property of Ru-Mo<sub>2</sub>C@CNT is also reflected in the E<sub>onset</sub>. 43 In terms of limiting current density, the ratio of 1:4 still reaches a high value, which is much higher than other mixing ratios. With the increase of CNT, the ORR activity is strengthened. It is supposed that the increased content of CNT means low

ruthenium-molybdenum content, small particle size and high active site exposure rate. Considering the electrochemical test results shown in CV and LSV curves, it can be concluded that Ru-Mo2C loading plays an important role in improving the ORR performance.

Kouteckye-Levich plots were obtained according to LSV measurements within the potential range from 0.3 to 0.7 V as shown in Fig. [10](#page-8-0)a. The almost parallel fitted lines indicate a first order reaction of dissolved oxygen. The electron transfer number of Ru-Mo2C@CNT-1/4 is calculated to be ranging from 3.91 to 4.1. These results demonstrate that the ORR of Ru-Mo2C@CNT-1/4 mainly follows the four-electron transfer process. Tafel plot is used to characterize the O2 adsorption rate on the catalysts for ORR. This analysis is performed with log (J) on the x-axis and potential over the y-axis. As shown in Fig. [10](#page-8-0)b, Ru-Mo2C@CNT-1/4 has a Tafel slope of 55.55 mV dec−<sup>1</sup> , which is much lower than the Tafel slope of other proportions of catalyst. This result suggests that Ru-Mo2C@CNT-1/4 has a faster oxygen reduction kinetic. In summary, Ru-Mo2C@CNT-1/4 possesses a positive Eonset, higher E1/2 and smaller Tafel slope.

The electrocatalytic stability is also an important indicator for ORR catalysts. The stability test is shown in Fig. [11a](#page-8-1). After 20000 s, Ru-Mo2C@CNT-1/4 retained 92.2% of its initial value, while the activity of the commercial 20% Pt/C catalyst dropped to about 75.1%. Therefore, it can be seen that the stability of Ru-Mo2C@CNT-1/4 was better than that of Pt/C. To investigate its tolerance to methanol, it was measured in an electrolyte containing 3 M methanol. As revealed in Fig. [11](#page-8-1)b, the introduction

of methanol would result in a significant decrease of the commercial Pt/C catalyst, whereas no noticeable change happened for the Ru-Mo2C@CNT-1/4 electrode, suggesting a great tolerance to methanol. These results confirm the excellent stability of Ru-Mo2C@CNT-1/4, which can be possibly explained by that the particles anchoring on CNT support could avoid the aggregation of the final products, keeping continuous electron transfer pathways.

To highlight the stability of the catalysts with CNT as the supports, the catalysts with Vulcan X72 as the support were prepared in the same way for comparison. The samples were tested for ORR in 0.1 M KOH solution, and the electrochemical performance and stability of Vulcan X72 supports were found to be lower than that of CNT supports. As for Fig. [12](#page-9-7)a, the Ru-Mo2C@Vulcan X72 exhibits redox peak in CV curves, however, the potential of Vulcan X72 is lower than that of CNT, indicating the importance of the carbon supports. In comparison, the onset potential and half-wave potential for Ru-Mo2C@Vulcan X72 catalysts were ≈0.92 and ≈0.81 V, which is ≈70 mV lower than that of Ru-Mo2C@CNT-1/4 catalysts. As shown in Fig. [12](#page-9-7)d, the Ru-Mo2C@Vulcan X72 retained 78.3% of its initial value, while the activity of the Ru-Mo2C@CNT-1/4 catalyst was maintained to 92.2%.

The enhanced ORR properties of the Ru-Mo2C@CNT-1/4 can be attributed to the unique Ru-Mo2C heterojunction with ultralow loading and the SMSI between the nano-heterojunction particles and the CNT support. Ru-Mo2C@CNT composite materials lead to this material having superior electronic conductivity, abundant active sites and stable structure, which are the fundamental reasons for its high electrocatalytic ORR activity and stability.

#### Conclusions

In summary, Ru-Mo<sub>2</sub>C@CNT catalysts with SMSI have been successfully fabricated by microwave pyrolysis process using carbon nanotubes as support and Mo(CO)<sub>6</sub> and Ru<sub>3</sub>(CO)<sub>12</sub> as precursors. Ru-Mo<sub>2</sub>C is anchored on CNT to promote stability and ORR. Among the synthesized Ru-Mo<sub>2</sub>C@CNT catalysts, Ru-Mo<sub>2</sub>C@CNT-1/4 exhibited the best ORR catalytic activity with the highest onset potential (0.94 V), half-wave potential (0.87 V) and limiting current density (6.37 mA cm $^{-2}$ ). The electron transfer number indicates that ORR is dominated by a four-electron reaction. It is worth noting that Ru-Mo<sub>2</sub>C@CNT has higher stability and methanol resistance than Pt/C. In conclusion, Ru-Mo<sub>2</sub>C loading has a beneficial effect on the ORR performance of CNT, and Ru-Mo<sub>2</sub>C@CNT is a high performance and low cost ORR catalyst for PEMFC.

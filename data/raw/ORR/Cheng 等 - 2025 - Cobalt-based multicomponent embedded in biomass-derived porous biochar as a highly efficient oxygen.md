## **Abstract**

The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is pivotal for energy conversion systems such as metal-air batteries and fuel cells, yet the development of cost-efective and efcient catalysts remains a challenge. This study introduces a cobalt-based multicomponent catalyst embedded in nitrogen-doped biochar derived from biomass, synthesized via a scalable pyrolysis process using 1,10-phenanthroline as a nitrogen source and chelating agent. The optimized catalyst ofWPC-950 demonstrated superior ORR performance with a half-wave potential of 0.81 V (vs. RHE), a limiting current density of 4.95 mA cm−2, excellent methanol tolerance, and long-term stability exceeding 92% retention after 30000 s in alkaline media. The high activity of catalyst stems from its unique structural features, including hierarchical porosity, a high degree of graphitization, and welldispersed Co-Nx active sites. These properties are achieved through the synergistic efects of nitrogen doping, cobalt stabilization, and the porous biochar framework, overcoming limitations of agglomeration and poor stability common in conventional biochar-based catalysts. The fndings address key scientifc challenges in enhancing ORR kinetics and stability, ofering a pathway toward cost-efective and environmentally friendly alternatives to precious metal-based catalysts for energy applications.

## **Highlights**

- A novel cobalt-based multicomponent catalyst embedded in N-doped biochar derived from sustainable biomass was developed.

## **1 Introduction**

Te oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) plays a crucial role in energy conversion and storage systems like metal–air batteries and fuel cells (Hui et al. [2022\)](#page-11-0). Tese systems are fundamental to advancing sustainable energy technologies due to their high energy densities and minimal environmental impact (Yang et al. [2022;](#page-12-0) Wei et al. [2023](#page-12-1)). However, the inherently slow kinetics of ORR necessitate the use of catalysts to enhance reaction efciency (Wang et al. [2022;](#page-12-2) Zhou et al. [2024\)](#page-12-3). To overcome the limitations of expensive and scarce platinum-based materials, researchers have turned to metal-free biochar catalysts sourced from biomass as a more sustainable option (Liang et al. [2022](#page-11-1); Anil et al. [2020](#page-11-2)). Despite their sustainability, biochar catalysts face several challenges, including limited catalytic activity due to a lack of intrinsic active sites, poor electrical conductivity, and insufcient stability under electrochemical conditions (Muhammad et al. [2024](#page-11-3); Lu et al. [2024\)](#page-11-4). As a result, transition metal-based catalysts have gained attention as a promising alternative, ofering superior catalytic performance and durability, thereby presenting a more viable option for efcient energy conversion systems (Mishra et al. [2024](#page-11-5); Feng et al. [2024](#page-11-6)).

Transition metal-based catalysts often face obstacles such as limited electrical conductivity and rapid degradation caused by irreversible surface redox reactions (Wang et al. [2018](#page-12-4)). Hybrid catalysts composed of transition metal oxides and carbon materials stand out as promising alternatives to conventional Pt/C catalysts for the ORR (Wang et al. [2017;](#page-12-5) Liu et al. [2014;](#page-11-7) Tong et al. [2016](#page-12-6); Chen et al. [2024](#page-11-8); Peng et al. [2023\)](#page-11-9). Cobalt-based compounds such as Co, CoO, Co3O4, and CoNx, when paired with carbon materials, have demonstrated excellent ORR activity in alkaline electrolytes (Alegre et al. [2017](#page-11-10); Belles et al. [2021;](#page-11-11) Li et al. [2021](#page-11-12); Zhang et al. [2024\)](#page-12-7). Dai's research team developed integrated Co oxide and nitrogen-doped carbon nanotube (CoO/NCNT) hybrid catalysts through a two-step process that deposited nanocrystals onto oxidized multiwalled carbon nanotubes (Liang et al. [2012](#page-11-13)). Another study developed an N-doped hybrid material consisting of Co3O4 nanocrystals deposited onto mildly reduced graphene oxide (Co3O4/N-rmGO), which demonstrated impressive ORR activity and stability in alkaline conditions. Unlike individual Co3O4 or graphene oxide, the hybrid showed excellent electrocatalytic performance, attributed to synergistic efects between Co3O4 nanocrystals and the graphene oxide support, N doping, and enhanced electron transfer (Liang et al. [2011](#page-11-14)). Sun et al. presented a catalyst (G-Co/CoO), where Co/CoO nanoparticles were self-assembled onto graphene surfaces via a solution-phase route. Tis G-Co/ CoO system exhibited comparable ORR activity to Pt/C, along with superior stability in alkaline electrolytes. Te strong interaction between graphene and Co/CoO nanoparticles, combined with the optimized dimensions of the Co/CoO, contributed to its efective ORR performance (Guo et al. [2012](#page-11-15)). Although these hybrid catalysts demonstrate notable electrocatalytic performance, there are challenges to address: complex composite structures hinder the identifcation of active sites, and carbon support corrosion can lead to detachment of the metal oxides. Recent studies have explored Co-based multicomponent hybrids (Co, CoO, Co3O4, and CoNx) embedded in N-doped biochar, which show promising potential as ORR electrocatalysts (Ma et al. [2020,](#page-11-16) [2023](#page-11-17); Lu et al. [2024](#page-11-4)).

To further enhance the performance of these hybrid catalysts, a nitrogen-rich compound of 1,10-phenanthroline has been utilized for both a chelating agent for cobalt and a nitrogen source for the carbon matrix. During pyrolysis, 1,10-phenanthroline decomposes to introduce Co-Nx sites and nitrogen functionalities into the carbon framework, enhancing electron transfer and oxygen adsorption and contributing to improved ORR performance (Wang et al. [2024](#page-12-8)). Te metal-complexes generated by 1,10-phenanthroline and some metal ions could be used in electrocatalysis feld (Pauric et al. [2011](#page-11-18); Brocato et al. [2013](#page-11-19); Zhan et al. [2019](#page-12-9)). Te complexes of metal ions and 1,10-phenanthroline would be decomposed above 400 ℃ as well as be carbonized above 650 ℃ (Onodera et al. [2014\)](#page-11-20). Additionally, metal ion complexes with 1,10-phenanthroline can be transformed into N-doped carbon materials. Tese N-doped carbon materials facilitate charge redistribution and enhance electron transfer during O2 chemisorption (Wu et al. [2021](#page-12-10)). Tey also serve as supports for binding small metal clusters through interactions between isolated metal species and nitrogen atoms (Onodera et al. [2014\)](#page-11-20). Biomass-based materials have attracted considerable attention as ORR catalysts because of abundant availability, low cost, variety, and renewability. It is crucial to recognize that the specifc surface area and catalytic performance of these biomass-derived carbon materials are heavily infuenced by the various treatment methods employed.

Biomass-derived carbon materials host unique porous structure formed via various treatment process, such as pyrolysis with chemical/physical activation, ammoxidation and hard/soft templating (Chen et al. [2020](#page-11-21)), and biomass-derived carbon materials could be selfdoped or doped with foreign atoms (e.g., N, P) to generate active sites for ORR process (Borghei et al. [2018](#page-11-22)). Wood equipped with porous and fbrous structure is from the stems and roots of trees, which is mainly composed of hemicellulose, cellulose and lignin. Woodderived materials exhibit some unique advantages, such Cheng *et al. Biochar (2025) 7:40* Page 3 of 13

as hierarchically porous structure and tunable multifunctionality, making them the ideal alternatives for the benchmark Pt/C towards ORR (Huang et al. [2019](#page-11-23)).

Tis study presents an innovative approach to developing a cobalt-based multicomponent catalyst embedded in nitrogen-doped biochar derived from biomass. By utilizing 1,10-phenanthroline as both a nitrogen source and a chelating agent, the synthesis achieves enhanced graphitization and stabilization of cobalt species. We mainly focused on exploring the feasibility of fabricating Co-based multicomponent embedded in the N-doped biochar materials as ORR catalyst and the corresponding electrocatalytic performance and reduction mechanism. Te resulting materials feature both CoNx groups and carbon-coated CoOx within the carbon matrix. Tis is attributed to the space confnement efect of the meso/ macro porous structure and the protective coordination provided by 1,10-phenanthroline. Tis novel method ofers a scalable and sustainable strategy for producing high-performance ORR electrocatalysts, addressing limitations of conventional biochar-based materials in activity and stability.

#### **2 Experimental section**

#### **2.1 Synthesis of the WPC materials**

Te dried wood biomass was ground into powder and mixed with Zn2(OH)2CO3·H2O (1:1 by weight) using a ball-milling process for 80 mins. Te mixture was pyrolyzed at 900 ℃ under N2 fow for 2 h to produce porous carbon, which was subsequently washed with dilute HCl, rinsed with deionized water, and dried overnight at 60 ℃. For catalyst preparation, 50 mg of the porous carbon was mixed with 100 mg of Co(NO3)2·6H2O in 90 mL ethanol and stirred for 30 mins. Separately, 90 mg of anhydrous 1,10-phenanthroline dissolved in 10 mL ethanol was added to the solution, followed by stirring for 6 h. Te resultant mixture was dried at 65 ℃ overnight and pyrolyzed under N2 fow at 750 ℃, 850 ℃, or 950 ℃ for 1 hour to yield WPC-T (W: wood, P: 1,10-phenanthroline, C: cobalt, T: temperature). Diferent temperatures were chosen to comprehensively evaluate the impact of increasing pyrolysis temperature on the catalytic performance and structural properties of the synthesized materials. Control samples WP-950 (without 1,10-phenanthroline) and WC-950 (without Co(NO3)2·6H2O) were prepared using the same process. Reagents were of analytical grade (Text S1), and structural characteristics were examined using various physicochemical techniques detailed in Text S2.

### **2.2 Electrochemical tests**

Te details of the electrochemical measurements were provided in Text S3.

## **3 Results and discussion**

## **3.1 Fabrication of the WPC materials**

Te fabrication process of the WPC catalyst was illustrated in Fig. [1](#page-2-0), utilizing wood biomass, 1,10-phenanthroline and Co(NO₃)₂·6H₂O as the carbon, nitrogen and cobalt sources, respectively.

Te fabrication process leveraged the hierarchical porous structure of biomass-derived carbon to homogeneously disperse cobalt and nitrogen species, forming Co-Nx and CoOx nanoparticles. Zn2(OH)2CO3·H2O acted as a physical pore-forming agent during pyrolysis

(Text S4), creating mesopores and macropores by decomposing into gases at 300–600 ℃ and generating micropores/mesopores through Zn reduction at 900 ℃ (Wang et al. [2021](#page-12-11); Li et al. [2019](#page-11-24)). 1,10-Phenanthroline played a multifaceted role by coordinating with Co2<sup>+</sup>, serving as a nitrogen source and facilitating the formation of porous structures. During high-temperature pyrolysis, it decomposed into carbon- and nitrogen-based gases (e.g., N₂, NH₃, and CO), which introduced nitrogen functionalities and further expanded the carbon matrix through internal pressure. Tis process yielded nitrogen-doped carbon frameworks coupled with CoOx nanoparticles. Te combination of templating methods, porous carbon, and nitrogen doping resulted in WPC materials with uniform Co distribution, abundant active sites, and enhanced ORR electrocatalytic properties. Te detailed characterization and performance validation were described in subsequent sections.

#### **3.2 Composition and structure of the WPC materials**

Figure [2](#page-3-0)a–j shows the SEM images for the obtained samples. Similar morphologies were observed for the WPC-750, WPC-850, and WPC-950 (Fig. [2](#page-3-0)a–c, f–h). A large quantity of pore structures with diferent sizes could be found in WPC- 950. However, Fig. [2](#page-3-0)d, i shows plenty of metal particles in the WC-950, suggesting that the presence of cobalt sources can facilitate the formation of these metal particles. Figure [2](#page-3-0)e illustrates the porous structure of the material synthesized with 1,10-phenanthroline as the nitrogen source, whereas Fig. [2j](#page-3-0) shows the signifcantly reduced porosity in the absence of 1,10-phenanthroline, indicating that the presence of nitrogen sources is the key to forming porosity of wood-based carbon materials. Te formation of nitrogen-containing gases (e.g., N2 and NH3) during pyrolysis contributes to pore generation through gas expansion and in situ reactions with the carbon framework. It is important to note that WPC-950 features a stacked and wrinkled graphite structure with a

hierarchical pore network, in which CoOx particles were embedded. To further examine the structure of all the samples, corresponding TEM images were also obtained. Metal particles and porous structure were observed in WPC-750, WPC-850, and WPC-950 (Fig. [2k](#page-3-0)–m, p–r). Te cobalt sources were agglomerated into metal clusters in WC-950 (Fig. [2n](#page-3-0), s), and the nitrogen sources induced lots of aperture structure in WC-950 (Fig. [2o](#page-3-0), t). Te results revealed that a Co-based phase was formed and embedded within the N-doped carbon matrix, thus leading to an enhanced ORR performance of WPC. Te STEM and corresponding elemental mapping images of WPC-950, presented in Fig. [2](#page-3-0)u–y, demonstrated the uniform distribution of C, Co, N, and O elements throughout WPC-950.

Raman spectroscopy was employed to investigate the chemical composition, phases, molecular interactions, and crystal structures of the WPC materials. Te Raman spectra of the catalysts were displayed across two wavenumber intervals. As shown in Fig. [3a](#page-4-0), four peaks locating at 470, 515, 609, and 671 cm-1 were observed in the wavelength range of 200-800 cm-1, which were responded to Eg, F2g, F2g, and A1g modes of cubicphase Co3O4, respectively (Jirátová et al. [2019;](#page-11-25) McNulty et al. [2017](#page-11-26)). Similar bands at 482, 519, 621, and 690 cm-1 were also detected in the work of Tang et al. ( [2008](#page-12-12)). CoO typically showed Raman bands around 468 and 672 cm-1 (Bindumadhavan et al. [2016](#page-11-27)). However, due to overlap with the strong Co3O4 bands, CoO bands were not distinctly visible. In the range of 800 to 2000 cm-1, the Raman spectrum refects the carbon structure of the samples. Figure [3b](#page-4-0) shows two main peaks at 1589 cm-1 and 1335 cm-1, corresponding to the G band and D band, respectively (Komba et al. [2018](#page-11-28)). Te D band is associated with disordered structures and defects in the carbon matrix, while the G band represents the vibrations of *sp2* hybridized carbon atoms in a graphite lattice (Wang et al. [2021](#page-12-11)). Te intensity ratio between the D band and the G band (*ID/IG*) serves as an indicator of the degree of graphitization in the samples. Te coexistence of Co metal

and 1,10-phenanthroline generates more graphitized structures. Control experiments were performed using samples without Co (WC-950) and without 1,10-phenanthroline (WP-950). Te *ID/IG* value of WPC- 950 (1.02) is the lowest compared to those of WPC-750 (1.08), WPC-850 (1.19), WC- 950 (1.08), WP-950 (1.12), revealing that WPC-950 possesses the highest graphitization degree and electronic conductivity. Te *ID*/*IG* values increased as the carbonization temperature raising from 750 to 850 ℃, but then decreased when the temperature was further elevated from 850 to 950 ℃. Tese could be explained that Phenanthroline completely decomposed at high temperature of 850 ℃, resulting in more defects and porosity. As the temperature increases to 950 ℃, the co-existence of Co metal and Phenanthroline generates more graphitized structures. For comparison, WC-950 showed a lower *ID*/*IG* value than that of WP-950, demonstrating the promotion of co-existence of Co metal and Phenanthroline for the graphitization of carbon materials.

Te crystal structure of the WPCs was analyzed by X-ray difraction (XRD) spectra, as shown in Fig. [3c](#page-4-0) for all the samples. For WPC-750, WPC-850, WPC-950, the predominant phases were Co (JCPDS 41-1487), CoO (JCPDS 15-0806), Co3O4 (JCPDS 43-1003) and graphite (JCPDS 41-1487). For WC-950, the main phases were Co (JCPDS 41-1487), CoO (JCPDS 15-0806), and Co3O4 (JCPDS 43-1003). For WP-950, graphite (JCPDS 41-1487) was only observed. A typical difraction peak at 2θ=26◦ was observed in all the samples, which was attributed to the (002) lattice plane of graphite carbon phase (Miao et al. [2021](#page-11-29)). Te degree of graphitization in the samples progressively increased with the rise in pyrolysis temperature from 750 to 950 ℃. Te graphite peak of WC-950 was not obvious, but the wide graphite peak of WP-950 was observed, demonstrating that the co-existence of phenanthroline and cobalt salt could boost the formation of graphite structure. Tese results exhibited that the graphitization structure could be originated form the phenanthroline. When cobalt salts existed, the graphitization degrees of samples could be further enhanced. However, the sole cobalt salts showed no apparent efect on the formation of graphitization in WC-950. Te signals of Co and CoO were enhanced at higher heat-treatment temperatures (from 750 to 950 ℃), meanwhile the signal of Co3O4 showed a decreased tendency. Tis phenomenon is consistent with previous reports (Zhong et al. [2020\)](#page-12-13) and can be attributed to the reduction of Co3O4 into CoO and metallic Co at elevated temperatures. Te phase transition observed in the XRD patterns corresponds to the changes detected in the Raman spectra. To further investigate the chemical states and surface electronic structures of the elements, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was performed on all the samples. Figure [3d](#page-4-0) shows that C, N, O and Co elements were observed in WPC-750, WPC-850, and WPC-950 catalysts.

Table S1 provided a comprehensive breakdown of the elemental composition, including the contents of C, N, O, and Co for all analyzed samples. As the pyrolysis temperature increased from 750 to 950 ℃, a noticeable decline in N content was observed, which is a typical behavior as higher temperatures often result in the release of N from carbon-based materials. Interestingly, WP-950 maintained a N content nearly identical to that of WPC-950, suggesting a certain level of thermal stability for N in these samples. Regarding the Co content, a more complex trend was identifed. Initially, the Co content decreased with rising temperatures; however, at higher pyrolysis temperatures, the Co content began to increase. Tis observation pointed toward a potential phase transformation of the Co species at elevated temperatures, possibly due to a redistribution of Co within the material matrix or changes in its chemical state.

As the primary objective of our study is to explore the role of nitrogen in the catalyst, we have concentrated our analysis on the nitrogen species. High-resolution XPS was performed to further explore the chemical states of N1s and Co 2p3/2 across all synthesized samples (Fig. [4](#page-6-0)). Te detailed deconvolution of the N1s peak revealed four N species present in the material. Pyridinic nitrogen (N1) observed at approximately 398.3 eV was typically associated with nitrogen atoms bonded to two *sp<sup>2</sup>* carbon atoms in a graphene-like structure. Te second nitrogen species of N-coordinated Co (N2: Co-Nx) appeared at around 399.15 eV and corresponded to nitrogen atoms coordinating with Co species, which can enhance catalytic performance. Pyrrolic nitrogen (N3), found at approximately 400.3 eV, was related to nitrogen atoms bonded to two carbon atoms in a fve-membered ring. Te fourth species of graphitic nitrogen (N4) was located at roughly 401.05 eV, indicating nitrogen atoms bonded within a graphitic network (Yi et al. [2019\)](#page-12-14). Tese N species (N1, N2, N3, and N4) were consistently observed in the WPC-750, WPC-850, and WPC-950 catalysts. Notably, the ratio of graphitic-N (N4) to pyridinic-N (N1) increased signifcantly with pyrolysis temperature, with the values of 1.9, 3.6, and 7.2 for WPC-750, WPC-850, and WPC-950 catalysts, respectively. Tis progressive increase suggested a higher degree of graphitization at elevated temperatures, which can contribute to improved electrical conductivity and stability in electrocatalytic applications.

Te upward trend in the N4/N1 ratio with increasing pyrolysis temperature suggested that the reconstruction of carbon skeleton is linked to variations in nitrogen species. It is possible to modify the relative content of Cheng *et al. Biochar (2025) 7:40* Page 7 of 13

<span id="page-6-0"></span>**Fig. 4** High-resolution N 1 s XPS spectra of WPC samples: **a** WPC-750, **b** WPC-850, **c** WPC-950, and **d** WP-950

diferent nitrogen species by regulating the pyrolysis temperature. Nitrogen doping introduces active sites, such as pyridinic-N and graphitic-N, which enhance the adsorption and activation of oxygen molecules during the ORR process. Additionally, the formation of Co-Nx structures in the nitrogen-doped biochar creates synergies between the metal and carbon framework, improving electron transfer and catalytic efciency. While undoped biochar lacks these specifc active sites, leading to lower catalytic activity and stability. Previous studies have shown that both Co-Nx and pyridinic-N enhance the onset potential, whereas graphitic-N contributes to an improvement in limiting difusion current density (*jL*). Te total content of Co-Nx, graphitic-N, and pyridinic-N for WPC-950 (92%) was signifcantly higher than those of WPC-750 (81%) and WPC-850 (80.7%), suggesting a good ORR activity for WPC-950.

Figure [5](#page-7-0) presents three types of Co species for the deconvoluted Co 2p3/2 spectra for WPC-750, WPC-850, WPC-950, and WC-950 catalysts. Te peaks observed at 778.5, 779.8, and 781.2 eV, corresponded to the Co, Co<sup>3</sup><sup>+</sup>

and Co2<sup>+</sup>, respectively (Yi et al. [2019](#page-12-14)). Te relative content of Co2<sup>+</sup> decreased when the pyrolysis temperature increased from 750 to 950 ℃ (the inset of Fig. [5a](#page-7-0)–d), suggesting an enhancement on the formation of CoO at high temperatures. Te Co<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> species were dominant in all four samples along with the XRD results.

Te hierarchical pore structure of the biochar plays a critical role in enhancing the performance of the electrocatalyst. Micropores provide abundant active sites for ORR, while mesopores and macropores facilitate efcient mass transport and difusion of reactants and products. Additionally, the well-distributed porosity prevents the agglomeration of cobalt species, ensuring uniform dispersion and improved catalytic efciency. Tese structural features collectively contribute to the superior activity and stability of the catalyst. Te nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms were measured to evaluate the porous structure and pore size distribution in all the samples. An apparent hysteresis related to type-IV isotherm hoop between the adsorption and desorption curves was found in all the samples, mirroring Cheng *et al. Biochar (2025) 7:40* Page 8 of 13

<span id="page-7-0"></span>**Fig. 5** High-resolution Co 2p3/2 XPS spectra of Co-based samples: **a** WPC-750, **b** WPC- 850, **c** WPC-950, and **d** WC-950

the existence of micro/mesoporous structure (Fig. [6a](#page-7-1)). Te unique mesoporous structure could boost the mass transport, improving ORR performance. Te rapid nitrogen uptake (P/P0 > 0.9) observed for WP-950 may be due to the larger pores in the material. Te pore sizes of all the samples were mainly distributed between 5.74 and 9.23 nm (Fig. [6b](#page-7-1)), demonstrating a mass of mesopores in the synthesized samples (Wang et al. [2021](#page-12-11)).

Te specifc surface area of WPC-950 (162.34 m<sup>2</sup> g-1) calculated through Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) was smaller compared to WPC-750 (396.99 m<sup>2</sup> g-1) and WPC-850 (258.75 m<sup>2</sup> g-1), suggesting that more Co-based

particles are embedded in the porous carbon framework along with the elevation of temperature. Te WC-950 (487.49 m2 g-1) exhibited a signifcantly smaller specifc surface area compared to WP-950 (1169.13 m2 g-1) (Table S2), which further verifed that the Co-based multicomponent was successfully anchored into the porous biomass-derived carbon materials. In addition, the total pore volume of the sample became smaller when the pyrolysis temperature increased (Table S2), further confrming the partial collapse of carbon framework is related to the existence of the Co-based multicomponent, and similar phenomenon can be found in other reports (Lu et al. [2021](#page-11-30)).

#### **3.3 Catalytic activity towards the ORR**

Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was conducted to examine the activity of ORR for all the samples. As shown in Fig. [7a](#page-8-0), the CV curves of the catalysts in O₂-saturated (solid line) and N2-saturated (dashed line) alkaline electrolytes were observed. A distinct O2 reduction peak was observed in O2-saturated alkaline electrolyte but absent in N2-saturated alkaline electrolyte. WPC-950 presented the most positive potential of O2 reduction peak of 0.79 V vs. RHE compared to those of WPC- 750 (0.76 V vs. RHE), WPC-850 (0.77 V vs. RHE), WC-950 (0.65 V vs. RHE), WP-950 (0.75 V vs. RHE), revealing its highest electrocatalytic performance. Additionally, the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) measurement was conducted to further evaluate the ORR performance for all the samples and the LSV curves at various rotation speeds were displayed in Fig. [7](#page-8-0)b–f. Te limiting current densities (*JL*) showed an increasing trend along with the increasing rotational speed of electrode.

As revealed in Fig. [8a](#page-9-0), b and Table S3, the WPC-950 (*E1/2*: 0.81 V vs. RHE; *JL*: 4.95 mA cm-2) showed better ORR performance than WPC-750 (*E1/2*: 0.788 V vs. RHE; *JL*: 3.69 mA cm-2), WPC-850 (*E1/2*: 0.802 V vs. RHE; *JL*:4.43 mA cm-2), WC-950 (*E1/2*: 0.768 V vs. RHE; *JL*: 3.11 mA cm-2), and WP-950 (*E1/2*: 0.805 V vs. RHE; *JL*: 4.4 mA cm-2). Te *E1/2* and *JL* of WPC-950 also were on a par with the previously reported catalysts as listed in Table S4, further verifying its remarkable ORR electrocatalytic performance. Te Tafel slope was calculated based on the LSV curves to evaluate the ORR kinetic activity of electrocatalysts. Generally, lower Tafel slope represents faster kinetic for the reaction (Gao et al. [2023](#page-11-31)). As shown in Fig. [8](#page-9-0)c, the Tafel slope of WPC-950 (51 mV/ dec) was much smaller than those of the other samples (72 mV/dec, 65 mV/dec for WC-950, WP-950, respectively), further demonstrating the superior ORR performance for WPC-950 catalyst. Crystalline CoOx species, high graphitization degree, pyridinic-N, high contents of graphitic-N and CoNx of the WPC-950 catalyst are contributed to the above results.

Two electron transfer pathways mainly occurred in the ORR process, including 2e pathway and 4e pathway. Te O2 can be directly reduced to H2O in a 4e pathway, which is highly expected in the metal-air battery (Ma et al. [2021](#page-11-32)). However, H2O2 generates as intermediate in the 2e pathway, which poisons the catalyst and corrodes the equipment. Te Koutecht–Levich (K-L) plots, based on the collected LSV curves at various rotation speed with the potential range between 0.25 V and 0.65 V, were applied to assess the number of transferred electrons (*n*) per O2 during ORR process. Te K-L plots of WPC-950 exhibited a highly linear trend, confrming that the initial reaction kinetics were associated with O2 concentration in the solution. Te *n* value of WPC-950 was 3.82–4.00, which was quite close to 4e pathway (Fig. [8](#page-9-0)d). RRDE tests were also measured to evaluate the H2O2 yield and the *n* value in order to deeply explore the mechanisms of the ORR process. Figure [8](#page-9-0)e, f showed that the H2O2 yield of WPC-950 catalyst was below 15% in the potential ranging of 0.2–0.8 V, meanwhile its *n* value was close to 4. Tese results showed that the WPC-950 catalyst followed a 4e pathway in alkaline electrolyte, which was consistent with the K-L results.

Te chronoamperometric response measurement was used to assess the methanol tolerance of WPC-950 and Pt/C in O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH electrolyte. Te value of Pt/C showed a sharp decrease of current when methanol was injected into electrolyte at 600 s, while WPC-950 exhibited a little change for adding methanol into the electrolyte (Fig. [9a](#page-10-0)). Te initial increase in current after adding CH3OH may be due to a temporary activation of the catalyst, where methanol interacts with the catalyst surface, enhancing catalytic activity before it stabilizes. Tis behavior contrasts with Pt/C, where CH3OH typically inhibits ORR. Tese results suggested that WPC-950 possessed satisfactory methanol resistance in alkaline electrolyte. Apart from the methanol tolerance, the chronoamperometric test was also used to assess the durability of WPC-950 and Pt/C. As shown in Fig. [9](#page-10-0)b, the WPC-950 catalyst showed good durability with 92.9% retention of current after continuous running of 30000 s, while Pt/C keep only 76.7% current retention. Te results demonstrated that WPC-950 have a good long-term stability. Above excellent properties of WPC-950 are ascribed to the protection for CoOx phase from carbon layer under harsh conditions, hence guaranteeing the prolonged stability of WPC-950 catalysts.

## **4 Conclusion**

In summary, the study introduced a novel cobalt-based multicomponent catalyst synthesized using 1,10-phenanthroline and biomass-derived biochar, which combines sustainability, cost-efectiveness, and superior ORR performance.

advancements in catalyst design, highlighting the synergistic efects of nitrogen doping, cobalt species stabilization, and optimized porous structures, ofering valuable insights for sustainable energy applications. Tese outstanding properties could be ascribed to the CoOx embedded into the skeleton of N-doped porous carbon materials, typical Co-Nx and graphitic-N active species, and low *ID/IG* value related to graphitization structure. Te activity of material arises from the transformation of Co-based species (e.g., metallic Co, CoO, Co3O4, and CoNx) and the conversion of 1,10-phenanthroline into N-doped graphitic carbon. Te relative abundance of various N species can also be regulated by adjusting the pyrolysis temperature. Te porous properties of biomassbased carbon materials are crucial to avoid the agglomeration of Co-based multicomponent by expanding the distance of adjacent Co ions, leading to the formation of small-scale particles. Co2<sup>+</sup> ion was adsorbed to the surfaces of porous biomass-based carbon materials. Subsequently, one part of the 1,10-phenanthroline coordinated with Co<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> ion through pyridinic-type nitrogen atoms, the other extra part of 1,10-phenanthroline was loaded on the surface of porous biomass-based carbon materials *via* non-covalent π–π interaction. In view of multifunctional template and abundant and cheap biomass, this work provided useful enlightenment for the advanced metal-free electrocatalysts preparation and the exploration of their activity. In future work, testing the electrocatalyst in acidic media would provide additional insights into versatility and broader applicability and this aspect will be explored. Additionally, expanding this approach to other biomass sources or exploring its application in energy conversion reactions beyond ORR, such as hydrogen evolution or CO2 reduction, could open new avenues for sustainable catalyst development.

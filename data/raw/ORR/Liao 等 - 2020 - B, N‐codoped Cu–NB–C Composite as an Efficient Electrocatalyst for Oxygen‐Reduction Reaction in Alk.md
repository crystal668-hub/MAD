As an alternative for platinum-based electrocatalysts, the development of non-precious metal catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is highly desirable for fuel cell applications. In this paper, we propose a facile preparation method for a B, N-codoped Cu–N/B–C nanomaterial as an efficient electrocatalyst for ORR in alkaline electrolytes. Onestep heat treatment of cyanamide/melamine, boric acid, and cupric chloride loaded on carbon black produces a Cu–N/B–C composite with a high specific surface area. The Cu–N/B–C-800 composite pyrolyzed at 800°C has the best ORR performance among all tested composites. Cu–N/B–C-800 saw an ORR onset potential at 0.95 V and a half-wave potential (E1/2) at 0.84 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) in 0.1 M KOH solution, which is comparable to the commercial 20 wt% Pt/C catalyst. Moreover, Cu–N/B–C-800 has a small negatively shifted E1/2 value ( 8.0 mV) under the accelerated-durability test condition, demonstrating superior stability and higher tolerance to the methanol-crossover effect compared with the Pt/C catalyst. Furthermore, the anion exchange membrane fuel cell (AEMFC) loaded with Cu–N/B–C-800 as the cathode catalyst has an open cell voltage of 0.85 V and a peak power density of 80 mW/cm<sup>2</sup> at 60°C without backpressure, which is in the list of optimal non-precious metal catalysts for ORR in AEMFC.

### **Introduction**

To address the serious problem of energy depletion, academic attention has been increasingly focused on the development of sustainable energy storage and conversion devices, such as fuel cells and metal–air batteries.[1] Numerous studies have been devoted to addressing the sluggish kinetics involved in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), which is a vital reaction in the cathode of fuel cells and metal–air batteries.[2] At present, commercial Pt is the best ORR catalyst, but its scarcity, high cost, and low stability severely hamper large-scale commercial application.[3] Consequently, the development of cost-effective, highly efficient, and long-term stable catalysts to replace Pt is required.[4]

In particular, iron- and copper-containing metalloenzymes, such as cytochrome *c* oxidase and multicopper oxidase (e.g. laccase), efficiently catalyze the ORR with minimal producing of any incomplete reduced byproducts.[5] Bioinspired Cu-based catalysts for efficient ORR have been previously reported.[6]

However, due to their complicated preparation process and low yield, practical applications are limited. As an alternative, Cu–N–C catalysts prepared by thermal pyrolysis are effective for efficient ORR.[7] Studies suggest that Cu–N–C catalysts are significantly affected by the surrounding environment of the the microscopic morphology of the carbon support.[9] Codoping nonmetallic heteroatoms, such as N,[10] F,[11] P,[12] and B,[13] have been introduced into the supporting carbon matrix to regulate the electronic structure as well as the microscopic morphology of the catalyst. Particularly, co-doping with two heteroatoms, one with higher and one with lower electronegativity than that of C (χ=2.55), such as B (χ=2.04) and N (χ=3.04), can create a unique electronic structure with a synergistic coupling effect between heteroatoms, along with the ability to form a wide range of possible active sites. Indeed, the synergy of such dual-doped nonmetallic heteroatoms and a porous structure exposing active sites can significantly promote catalytic ORR activity.[14,17] In recent years, Cu-based catalysts have been widely applied to metal–air batteries, but their application in anion exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs) is limited.[15]

copper metal center, including the electronic structure[8] and

The B, N-codoped carbon matrix were, however, usually obtained by thermal chemical vapor deposition (CVD)[14d] or a tedious multi-step preparation method.[13d] In this paper, a facile and cost-effective approach was employed to prepare a B, N-codoped hierarchical porous nanomaterial Cu–N/B–C as a Cu-based efficient and stable electrocatalyst for ORR in alkaline electrolytes. Cu–N/B–C is readily prepared by one-step thermal pyrolysis of small molecule compounds loaded on a carbon matrix, in which cyanamide/melamine, boric acid, and cupric chloride are taken as the nitrogen, boron, and copper sources, respectively. The prepared Cu–N/B–C-800 catalyst demonstrates high ORR activity with a half-wave potential (E1/2= 0.84 V) comparable to commercial Pt/C (E1/2=0.87 V vs. RHE) in an alkaline-electrolyte environment. In addition, it has signifi-

cantly enhanced methanol-crossover tolerance and stability ( $\Delta E_{1/2} = -8.0$  mV under accelerated-durability test) compared with the Pt/C catalyst ( $\Delta E_{1/2} = -34$  mV). Furthermore, the membrane electrode assembly of AEMFCs with Cu–N/B–C as the cathode obtains a maximum power density of 80 mW/cm² at 60 °C without any backpressure.

#### **Results and Discussion**

The morphology and microstructure of the prepared catalysts were probed by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). The Cu-N/B-C-800 FESEM image shows a hierarchical porous structure that may benefit the mass transfer process (Figure 1A). Both Cu-N/B-C-800 and Cu-N-C-800 have an irregular particle morphology, with a rough particle size of 30 nm; moreover, the Cu-N-C-800 has a higher mesoporous density compared with Cu-N/B-C-800 (Figure 1A and S1 A-B), which can be attributed to a self-hardening effect due to the addition of boric acid. The Cu-N/B-C-800 HRTEM image shows its few-layer graphitic carbon fringes with a (002) lattice spacing of 0.34 nm in the edges(inset, Figure 1B), suggesting that it mainly consists of amorphous porous graphitic carbon with no metallic alloy particles (Figure 1B). The Cu-N/B-C-800 FESEM mapping images suggest that B, N, and Cu are uniformly distributed in the carbon matrix (Figure 1C).

The XRD spectra show two peaks at  $25^{\circ}$  and  $43^{\circ}$ , which are derived from the typical diffraction angle of the lattice plane

(002) and (100) carbon material, respectively (Figure 2A).[16] Moreover, no peaks can be observed for the metallic alloy between  $25^{\circ}$  and  $43^{\circ}$ ,  $^{[17]}$  which is consistent with the HRTEM observation. The prepared composites were further analyzed by Raman spectroscopy. The Raman spectra of Cu-N/B-C-900, Cu-N/B-C-700, Cu-N/B-C-800, Cu-N-C-800, and N/B-C-800 are shown in Figure 2B; the two peaks at 1338 and 1580 cm<sup>-1</sup> correspond to the D-band vibration mode of the sp<sup>3</sup> carbon atom in the defect structure and the G-band vibration mode of the in-plane sp<sup>2</sup> hybridized carbon, respectively.<sup>[18]</sup> The I<sub>D</sub>/I<sub>G</sub> ratio for Cu-N/B-C-700 (1.18), Cu-N/B-C-800 (1.17), and Cu-N/ B-C-900 (1.16) decreased slightly as the temperature increased, suggesting that increasing the treating temperature reduces defects in carbon composites. Indeed, introducing B into Cu-N-C-800 increased the  $I_D/I_G$  ratio of the composite. For all samples, the intensity ratio of  $I_D/I_G$  is larger than 1, which suggests the existence of many defects that may benefit to the catalytic activity for ORR.

The surface properties were further analyzed by the  $N_2$  adsorption–desorption isotherms recorded at 77 K. An impressive BET surface area of Cu–N–C-800 (1484 m²/g) can be observed in Figure 2C. With the doping of B heteroatoms, the BET surface area of Cu–N/B–C-800 (757 m²/g) significantly decreased, which is consistent with the FESEM observation. For B-doped samples N/B–C-800 (401 m²/g), Cu–N/B–C-900 (1091 m²/g), Cu–N/B–C-800 (757 m²/g), and Cu–N/B–C-700 (681 m²/g), introducing copper and increasing the treating temperature increase the surface area.

This is beneficial since a large surface area can result in an increase in active sites for enhanced ORR performance. In addition, the pore-size distribution is mainly within 2–50 nm (Figure 2D), which indicates a mesoporous structure. This is essential for facilitating the mass transfer process during electrocatalytic ORR.

Furthermore, the composition of the prepared composites was probed by XPS. The survey spectra of Cu-N/B-C-800 indicate the presence of B, C, N, O, and Cu elements (Figure 3A), suggesting successful doping of B, N, and Cu atoms into the carbon matrix. The atomic content of B, C, N, O, and Cu in Cu-N/B-C-800 is provided in Table S1 alongside other prepared composites, from which it is evident that Cu atom content in Cu-N/B-C-800 (0.55 atom%) is the highest among the copper-containing samples. To further explore the chemical environment surrounding each atom, high-resolution XPS was conducted. The broad peak of the high-resolution N 1s XPS of Cu-N/B-C-800 can be deconvoluted into five peaks with binding energy at 397.3, 397.9, 398.6, 399.6, and 403.0 eV with respect to N-B, pyridinic N, pyrrolic N, graphitic N or Cu-N, and N-O species<sup>[19]</sup>, respectively (Figure 3C). According to previous studies, the pyridinic and graphitic N/Cu-N sites are responsible for the ORR in an alkaline-electrolyte environment.[20] The high-resolution B 1s XPS spectra of Cu-N/B-C-800 have a broad peak that can be deconvoluted into four peaks at 189.7, 190.3, 190.9, and 191.7 eV, corresponding to the B-N-C, BC<sub>3</sub>, BC<sub>2</sub>O, and BCO<sub>2</sub> bonds, respectively.<sup>[21]</sup> This indicates that the B element was successfully doped into the carbon matrix, where it affected the electronic structure. The high-resolution Cu 2p

scan spectra have two signal peaks at 934 eV for Cu 2p3/2 and 954 eV for Cu 2p1/2 along with a typical satellite peak at 941 eV (Figure 3D).[6a] The fitted Cu 2p3/2 peak at 931.9 eV can be assigned to Cu<sup>+</sup>; moreover, the fitted Cu 2p3/2 peak at 934.0 eV and the fitted Cu 2p1/2 peak at 953.5 eV can be assigned to Cu<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup>. [22] Indeed, the content of Cu<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> is much higher than Cu<sup>+</sup>, indicating that major amounts of Cu<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> exist in the Cu–N/B–C-800 catalyst. Alternatively, the ratio of Cu<sup>+</sup> to Cu<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> in the Cu– N–C-800, Cu–N/B–C-700, and Cu–N/B–C-900 composites increased slightly (Figure S2–4).

To explore the effect of pyrolysis temperature on the catalyst performance, the ORR catalytic activity of the Cu–N/B– C composites pyrolyzed at 700, 800, and 900°C was evaluated. The cyclic voltammograms (CVs) of the catalysts were recorded in Ar- and O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH solution. Redox peaks cannot be observed in the Ar-saturated solution, but, for the O2-saturated solution, a well-defined cathodic peak can be seen, suggesting good ORR catalytic activity. Indeed, the peak potential for Cu–N/B–C-800 (0.855 V vs. RHE) is more positive than that of Cu–N/B–C-700 (0.816 V) and Cu–N/B–C-900 (0.837 V; Figure 4A). This indicates that Cu–N/B–C-800 pyrolyzed at 800°C has better ORR activity than when treated at 700°C and 900°C. Thus, 800°C was selected as the optimal pyrolysis temperature. Furthermore, the observed cathodic peak potential of Cu–N/B–C-800 for ORR is also more positive than the control samples of Cu–N–C-800 (0.82 V) and N/B–C-

800 (0.75 V; Figure 4B) in the O2-saturated solution, which suggests that introducing Cu and B is vital for optimizing ORR activity.

To further investigate the catalytic performance, the Linear scanning voltammograms (LSVs)were recorded using a rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) in O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH solution (Figure 4C and D). The onset and half-wave potential (E1/2) for ORR are usually taken as metrics to evaluate the electrocatalytic activity of a catalyst. Cu–N/B–C-800 has a comparable onset (0.95 V vs. RHE) and E1/2 value (0.84 V) with that of 20 wt.% Pt/C (Eonset=1.0 V; E1/2=0.87 V) under similar conditions; the E1/2 value is also more positive than that of Cu–N/B–C-700, Cu–N/ B–C-900, Cu–N–C-800, and N/B–C-800 (Table 1). Moreover,

[a] Catalyst activity was evaluated in O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH solution. Catalyst loaded amount is as follows: 1.0 mg/cm<sup>2</sup> ; Pt/C: 0.3 mg/cm2 . [b] Eonset is defined as the potential where the ORR takes place with LSV deviated off the background line under Ar. [c] The value of E1/2 was collected from the LSV curves at 1600 rpm. [d] The data was obtained from Figure 4C and D at 0.6 V.

doping Cu into N/B–C-800 and B into the Cu–N–C-800 composites positively shifted both the onset and E1/2 values (Figure 4D and Table 1), which is consistent with the above CV

observation. Indeed, Cu–N/B–C-800 is among the most efficient Cu-based ORR catalysts (Table S2)

ORR involves a complex multi-step process, which may proceed in a 2e- and/or 4e-reduction pathway. The plot of H2O2 yield (Figure 4E) and electron transfer number (Figure 4F) of said catalysts for ORR reveals that less than 10% of peroxide species were generated for Cu–N/B–C-800 in the potential range of 0.2 to 0.8 V, an amount that is significantly lower than that of the N/B–C-800 composite that lacks the Cu center. The electron transfer number of Cu–N/B–C-800 for ORR ranges from 3.80 to 3.85, suggesting a near 4e-reduction pathway.

The long-term stability of a catalyst for ORR is an important issue. The chronoamperometric responses of Cu–N/B–C-800 and 20 wt.% Pt/C were tested at 0.65 V vs RHE in O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH solution with a rotation rate of 900 rpm. Cu–N/B–C-800 maintained a current almost equivalent to its initial value (*>* 97.0%) after continuous operation over 25000 s (Figure 5A), whereas roughly 61% of its initial current was maintained for the 20 wt.% Pt/C under the same conditions. In addition, the stability of Cu–N/B–C-800 was further measured through the accelerated-durability test by cycling the potential from 0.5 to 1.0 V (vs. RHE) in O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH solution. After 10000 cycles, the E1/2 of Cu–N/B–C-800 negatively shifted by 8.0 mV (Figure 5B), which is far less than the Pt/C (ΔE1/2 = 34 mV; Figure S6). This implies that the Cu–N/B–C-800 has excellent stability for ORR in an alkaline-electrolyte environment. Furthermore, the ability of the Cu–N/B–C-800 catalyst to tolerate the methanol-crossover effect was assessed, the results of which suggest that introducing methanol to the electrolyte (3.0 M) has a negligible effect on the obtained reduction current catalyzed by Cu–N/B–C-800 (Figure 5C). Contrastingly, the Pt/C catalyst experienced a significant current drop when methanol was introduced, indicating that Cu–N/B–C-800 possesses higher methanol tolerance than the Pt/C catalyst.

In addition, the electrocatalytic performance of Cu–N/B–C-800 in a H2–O2 AEMFC was examined, where Cu–N/B–C-800 was applied as the cathode (2.0 mg/cm2 ) for ORR and 20 wt.% Pt/C (2.0 mg/cm2 ) was the anode for hydrogen-oxidation reaction. According to Figure 5D, the AEMFC loaded with Cu– N/B–C-800 achieved a maximum power density of 80 mW/cm<sup>2</sup> with an open cell voltage of 0.85 V at 60°C without backpressure. The obtained peak power density is higher than the majority of previous reports listed in Table 2.

### **Conclusion**

In this paper, hierarchical porous Cu-based ORR electrocatalysts were developed, in which B and N were codoped into the Cu– N/B–C composites through the one-step pyrolysis treatment of carbon-loaded cyanamide/melamine, boric acid, and cupric chloride. The results suggest that the composite pyrolyzed at 800°C had the best ORR performance. In addition, introducing B into the Cu–N–C composite positively shifted both the onset and half-wave potentials. Furthermore, the optimized Cu–N/B– C-800 exhibited ORR performance (Eonset=0.95 V; E1/2 = 0.84 V vs. RHE) comparable to commercial 20 wt.% Pt/C catalyst in 0.1 M KOH solution. However, Cu–N/B–C-800 demonstrated superior stability for ORR and a much higher tolerance to the methanol-crossover effect than the Pt/C catalyst. The AEMFC loaded with Cu–N/B–C-800 as the cathode catalyst had a peak power density of 80 mW/cm2 , which is in the list of excellent non-precious metal catalysts for ORR in AEMFC. Overall, this paper demonstrated that a Cu-based ORR electrocatalyst is a promising alternative to commercial Pt/C in alkaline media.

# **Exploring the Synergistic Effects of Chlorine Coordination** in Iron Phthalocyanine for Efficient Oxygen Reduction **Catalysis**

Tesfaye Alamirew Dessie,\* Lemlem Seyoum Seifu, and Woldesenbet Bafe Dilebo

Chlorine-coordinated iron phthalocyanine is designed and synthesized for 4 e<sup>-</sup> pathway oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Iron phthalocyanine (FePc) is a promising nonprecious catalyst for the ORR. Unfortunately, FePc with plane-symmetric Fe-N4 site usually exhibits an unsatisfactory ORR activity due to its poor O<sub>2</sub> adsorption and activation. In this work, Chlorine-coordinated iron phthalocyanine (CI-FePc) has been studied as a catalyst for the electrochemical ORR. Coordination of iron phthalocvanine with chlorine introduces additional active sites for ORR, improving its catalytic activity. The chlorine atoms enhance the electron transfer process and facilitate the ORR validated by in situ Raman spectroscopy. The obtained catalyst exhibits fast kinetics for O<sub>2</sub> adsorption and activation with an ultralow Tafel slope of 30 mV dec<sup>-1</sup> and a remarkable half-wave potential of 0.80 V. This work offers a new strategy to regulate catalytic sites for better performance ORR.

#### 1. Introduction

Polymer electrolyte fuel cells garner significant attention due to their promising applications in various sectors, including transportation, portable energy solutions, and residential combined heat and power systems.<sup>[1]</sup> A critical challenge in this field is the development of an effective and cost-efficient electrocatalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The full reduction of O<sub>2</sub> to OH<sup>-</sup> or water necessitates the transfer of four electrons during the reaction, resulting in significantly slower kinetics compared to the hydrogen oxidation reaction occurring at the counter electrode. [2] Platinum (Pt)-based electrocatalysts are the predominant choice for ORR in contemporary commercial proton exchange fuel cell systems, owing to their superior catalytic performance. Nevertheless, these electrocatalysts face significant challenges, including their high cost, the scarcity of precious metal resources,[3] and susceptibility to poisoning by trace amounts of carbon monoxide (CO) present in fuels.[4] The ORR plays a pivotal role in influencing the energy efficiency of fuel cells and metal-air batteries.<sup>[5]</sup> Therefore, the catalytic activation of oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) to enhance the kinetics of the ORR is essential for the optimal performance of these technologies. [6] While platinum (Pt)-based catalysts exhibit favorable 2D adsorption and activation of O2, it is

imperative to explore highly efficient non-Pt ORR catalysts to further the development of fuel cells and metal-air batteries.<sup>[7]</sup> Catalysts based on Fe-Nx sites have promising catalytic activ-

ity for the ORR.[8] Iron phthalocyanine (FePc) has gained significant interest as a non-Pt ORR catalyst because of its unique Fe-N<sub>4</sub> active site and the low energy barrier for reactions in the ORR process.<sup>[9]</sup> FePc has a common 2D and plane-symmetric structure. This symmetry causes the electron distribution in the Fe-N₄-active sites to be uniform, making it difficult for O2 to adsorb and activate. [10] To improve O<sub>2</sub> adsorption and activation, breaking this electronic symmetry could be a useful approach, which would significantly boost the ORR activity of the FePc catalyst.[11] One way to enhance the ORR catalytic performance of FePc is by coordinating it axially with various functional groups. Functional groups such as O, F, Cl, Br, I, OH, SH, CN, SCN, NCS, ClO, ClO<sub>2</sub>, HCO<sub>3</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, and C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>4</sub>N<sub>2</sub> were chosen as axial ligands. Many of these have been noted for their ability to coordinate axially with Fe-N<sub>4</sub>. [12] These ligands have different electronic and geometric structures, making them a good example for other potential ligands. Density functional theory calculations indicate that all penta-coordinated FePc catalysts, known as FePc-X, show both thermodynamic and kinetic stability, highlighting their possible use in electrocatalysis.[13] A composite catalyst (FeAB-O) is created by linking the FePc molecule with oxygen groups on an acetylene black (AB-O) matrix that has been treated with O<sub>2</sub> plasma. This setup enhances O<sub>2</sub> adsorption and the ORR. Theoretical studies indicate that the O coordination at the axial sites (O-FeN<sub>4</sub>) disrupts the electronic symmetry of Fe, causing electrons to concentrate on the oxygen. This clear electron concentration on the O-FeN4 sites aids in the adsorption and activation of axial O2.[14] A new approach, FePc is combined with defect-rich CoNx-doped hollow carbon nanostraw, which comes from cobalt-doped indium-based metal-organic frameworks. This improvement is due to the CoNx structure's ability to effectively adjust the Fe-N<sub>4</sub> active sites. The hollow nanostraw design also

greatly enhances the accessibility of these active sites, leading to better catalytic performance. FePc@HCoNC shows outstanding ORRperformance.[15] Iodine-modified FePc on Au(111) enhances ORR activity by altering Fe's electronic structure (higher spin state) and weakening oxygen binding, as shown by electrochemical scanning tunneling microscopy (ECSTM). In contrast, iodine does not improve Co-N4 sites, highlighting the need for strong axial ligand-metal interactions to boost catalysis.

Bio-inspired chlorine-doped Fe2P on nitrogen-doped carbon (Cl-Fe2P/NC) mimics bamboo structure for enhanced oxygen reduction in microbial fuel cells (MFCs). Chlorine boosts electron transfer, inhibits biofilm growth, and improves performance, achieving 0.91 V half-wave potential and 1505 mW m<sup>2</sup> power density over 500 h. This approach advances catalyst design through biomimicry.[17] By combining FePc with Eu2O3, an f-p-d orbital coupling (Eu–O–Fe) strategy enhances Fe's spin state, increasing for example, occupancy and improving ORR efficiency. This modification optimizes oxygen adsorption, lowers the reaction barrier, and accelerates charge transfer. The f-band further stabilizes Fe's electronic structure, enhancing durability.[18]

Chlorine-coordinated iron phthalocyanine (Cl-FePc) has been examined in this study as a catalyst for the four-electron electrochemical RR. The iron phthalocyanine catalyst, coordinated with chlorine, has demonstrated strong electrocatalytic activity for the four-electron ORR. It shows high current densities and low onset potentials. This catalyst outperforms commercial iron phthalocyanine and other nonprecious metal catalysts, positioning it as a viable substitute for expensive platinum-based catalysts. The incorporation of chlorine into the FePc structure significantly enhances its catalytic performance for the ORR. Chlorine atoms introduce additional active sites and promote more efficient electron transfer, which is crucial for accelerating the ORR process. Moreover, the spatial arrangement of chlorine can modulate the electronic structure of FePc, favoring the desirable fourelectron reduction pathway over less efficient routes. This enhanced pathway directly improves the overall catalytic activity and selectivity, making Cl modified FePc a promising candidate for energy conversion technologies. The strategic tuning of FePc's molecular structure through halogenation thus presents an effective approach to optimizing ORR performance.[19]

# 2. Results and Discussion

#### 2.1. Synthesis and Structural Characterization of Catalyst

The synthesis of Cl-FePc is illustrated in Figure 1. Chlorinecoordinated iron phthalocyanine (Cl-FePc) was synthesized by solidphase reaction of phthalonitrile and iron(II) chloride (FeCl2.4H2O) with ammonium heptamolybdate ((NH4)6Mo7O24.4H2O) catalyst.

X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS): XPS is a technique used to determine the elemental composition and chemical state of the surface of a material. In the case of chlorine-coordinated iron phthalocyanine, XPS can provide information about the binding energies of the iron, carbon, chlorine, and nitrogen in the sample. It can also reveal any changes in the oxidation state of iron or the presence of other chemical species on the surface.[20] According to the elemental survey, FePc and Cl-FePc molecules has Fe (700–730 eV), and N (395–430 eV) and no Mo residue Peaks (Figure 2a). But Cl-FePc molecule has an additional peak Cl peak (200 eV). The XPS spectra of chlorine-coordinated iron phthalocyanine (Cl-FePc) and iron phthalocyanine (FePc) typically include the core-level signals of iron (Fe 2p) and nitrogen (N1s) (Figure 2b,c). These signals are the same for both catalyst, which means that the chemical bonding and electronic structure of the Cl-FePc and commercial FePc molecules are no difference. The Fe2p region in the XPS spectrum of Cl-FePc and FePc consists of two main peaks, corresponding to the Fe 2p3/2 and Fe 2p1/2 core levels (Figure 2b). The Fe2p3/2 peak typically appears around 710 eV, while the Fe 2p1/2 peak is observed around 715 eV. The position, shape, and intensity of these peaks can provide insights into the oxidation state of iron in Cl-FePc and FePc and any

interaction with the surrounding ligands. Therefore, the Cl-FePc and FePc molecules are in <sup>þ</sup>2 oxidation states.[21] The N 1s region shows the core-level signal of the nitrogen atoms in Cl-FePc and FePc. The N1s peak is typically observed around 395–430 eV. The position and shape of this peak can provide information about the coordination and chemical bonding of the nitrogen atoms in the phthalocyanine ring. In addition to the main peaks aforementioned, there may be additional satellite peaks or shakeup/shake-off features associated with the Fe2p and N1s core levels. These features can provide further details about the electronic structure and electronic interactions in FePc. Therefore, in both catalysts, we observe same peak positions (Figure 2c) at 395 eV (Pyrollic-N), 408 eV (Fe-N) and 417 eV (NOx).[22]

X-ray Diffraction (XRD): XRD is a technique used to study the crystalline structure and phase composition of materials. By exposing the chlorine-coordinated iron phthalocyanine sample to X-rays and analyzing the diffraction pattern, XRD can provide information about the crystal structure, lattice parameters, and presence of any impurities or secondary phases. It can also reveal changes in the arrangement of the atoms in the material due to chlorine coordination.[23] The synthesized powder was analyzed using XRD, as shown in Figure 2d. The pattern clearly shows the formation of FePc. The prominent Bragg reflection peaks at 15° and 29.7° are well indexed to the planes (200) and (312), indicating good crystallinity.[24] The primary reason of the disappearance of the chlorine-coordinated iron phthalocyanine's XRD peak at 7.1° (100) due to phase transformation, in which the material changes to a different crystalline phase that does not display the same diffraction pattern, which may be induced by the coordination of chlorine with iron.[25]

Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) is a technique used to analyze the molecular vibrations and chemical bonding in a material. By measuring the absorption and transmission of infrared light at different frequencies, FTIR can provide information about the functional groups and chemical bonds present in chlorine-coordinated iron phthalocyanine. It can also reveal any changes in the vibrational modes of the molecule due to the chlorine Coordination. The FTIR of the Cl-FePc (Figure 3a) demonstrates that the typical peaks appearing at 3600, 2342, 1619, 1286, 936, and 569 cm<sup>1</sup> are assigned to the specific vibration of C-N (adsorbed), C=C (Pc ring), C-N (Pc ring), C-H bending (Pc ring) and Fe-Cl stretching, respectively.[26] The result evidences the electronic interaction between the FePc and Cl, which lowers the FePc symmetry structure and extends the Fe─N bond length. This electronic interaction can cause electron redistribution and promote O2 adsorption.[27]

X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS): XAS is a technique that provides information about the electronic and structural properties of a material.[28] By measuring the absorption of X-rays at different energies, XAS can provide insights into the local coordination and oxidation state of the central metal ion (iron) in chlorinecoordinated iron Phatalocyanine. It can also provide information about the electronic structure and bonding in the material. X-ray absorption near-edge spectra (XANES) of Fe K-edge (Figure 3b) show obvious positive shift in Cl-FePc compared with in FePc, indicating the slight change of electronic structure of Fe.

Moreover, a preedge peak around 7114 eV can be indexed to the square-planar and Centro-symmetric Fe–N4 structure of FePc. It should be mentioned that Cl-FePc exhibits a lower peak intensity of in-plane Fe-N4 structure than that of FePc, which can be attributed to the axial coordination breaking the in-plane Fe–N4 structure. XANES shows a positive shift in Cl-FePc versus. FePc (Figure 3b), indicating increased Fe oxidation state (toward Fe3þ). Fe2<sup>þ</sup> ! Fe3<sup>þ</sup> shifts the edge to higher energy due to reduced electron density. Preedge peak at 7114 eV (square-planar Fe-N4) is weaker in Cl-FePc, suggesting axial Cl coordination distorts symmetry, possibly inducing partial charge transfer (Fe2<sup>þ</sup> ! Fe3þ). Additionally, extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra (Figure 3c) of Fe K-edge show that the coordination number of Fe in Cl-FePc is higher than the precise four nitrogen-coordination (Fe-N4). These characterization results prove the formation of axial Cl coordination with the FePc. The k-space and Wavelet Transform (WT) of Cl-FePc and FePc are exactly the same (Figure 3d–f).[29]

#### 2.2. Electrochemical Performance and in Situ Raman Analysis

The electrochemical ORR performance of chlorine-coordinated iron phthalocyanine (Cl-FePc) in KOH can be evaluated using various electrochemical techniques. These techniques provide insights into the catalytic activity, stability, and reaction mechanism of the material during the ORR.

The linear scan voltammetry (LSV) curves of FePc, Cl-FePc, Pt/C and MoPc were conducted to further study their ORR properties (Figure 4a). Thus, Cl-FePc presents a remarkable E1/2 of 0.85 V and a calculated kinetic current density (Jk) of 2.0 mA cm<sup>2</sup> at 0.80 V, which are much superior to FePc (E1/2= 0.6 V, J<sup>k</sup> = 1.5 mA cm<sup>2</sup> at 0.6 V) and MoPc (E1/2= 0.5 V, Jk= 0.5 mA cm<sup>2</sup> at 0.5 V). But Pt/C (E1/2= 0.88 V, Jk= 5.0 mA cm<sup>2</sup> at 0.88 V) is still better activity than Cl-FePc. Instead, MoPc, and FePc only exhibit inferior half-wave potentials (E1/2) and limited current density (JL).

Notably, the Cl-FePc has the most excellent Tafel slope (Figure 4b) of 30 mV dec<sup>1</sup> , which is lower than those of FePc (46.22 mV dec<sup>1</sup> ) and MoPc (204.92 mV dec<sup>1</sup> ), confirming the fastest kinetic process of Cl-FePc for O2 adsorption/activation and ORR. The current density is also increased with increasing the rotation speed using Cl-FePc catalyst electrode (Figure 4c).

The collected Raman spectra are analyzed to identify the Raman peaks associated with different molecular vibrations. Changes in the peak positions, intensities, and widths can provide insights into the structural changes and chemical reactions occurring during the ORR. We carried out the in situ Raman spectroscopic analysis of ORR using chlorine-coordinated Iron phthalocyanine (Figure 4d). The Fe-OOH and OH vibrations are detected by the peaks that emerged at 685 and 833 cm<sup>1</sup> , respectively. The results show the stepwise ORR process using the O2 ! OOH! OH pathway.[30]

## 3. Conclusion

In conclusion, we introduced a strategy based on chlorine coordination-induced electronic localization to modify the O2 adsorption capacity and the ORR performance of Fe-N4 sites within FePc. Techniques such as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), and in situ Raman spectroscopy demonstrated that the improved catalytic activity for ORR can be attributed to the enhanced adsorption of O2 and the expedited charge transfer from the iron center to the O2 molecule. The Cl-FePc, characterized by optimal axial Cl coordination, demonstrated an unprecedented Tafel slope of 30 mV dec<sup>1</sup> and achieved a remarkable half-wave potential of 0.85 V vs. RHE, significantly outperforming commercial FePc. There exists a positive correlation between the axial Cl coordination number and the performance in the ORR. This study introduces a novel approach to modulate the electronic localization properties of catalytic active sites, thereby influencing reactant adsorption and enhancing catalytic reaction rates.

## 4. Experimental Section

#### Chlorine Doped Iron Phthalocyanine (Cl-FePc) Synthesis

Chlorine coordinated iron phthalocyanine (Cl-FePc) was synthesized by solid phase reaction of 76 mg phthalonitrile, 96 mg of ammonium heptamolybdate ((NH4)6Mo7O24.4H2O) and 96 mg of iron (II) chloride (FeCl2.4H2O). This reaction occurred after 6 h in a round bottom flask equipped with a condenser at 200 °C and purging Chlorine gas throughout the reaction. Then we treated the sublimated residue powders with moderately hot 1 M potassium hydroxide for 6 h and washed them with ethanol and acetone to remove molybdate, molybdenum oxides, and other residues.[31]

#### ORR Electrochemical Performance Test

The catalyst ink was prepared by dispersing 5 mg Cl-FePc in 1 mL of 3:1 (v/v) Milli-Q water/isopropanol with 10 μL Nafion (5 wt%), followed by 30 min bath sonication. A total of 6 μL ink (1.2 mg cm<sup>2</sup> catalyst loading) was drop-cast onto a polished glassy carbon RDE (5 mm diameter) and dried at room temperature. ORR tests were conducted in O2-saturated 0.5 M KOH at 10 mV s<sup>1</sup> with rotation rates of 400–1600 rpm. Potentials were referenced to Hg/HgO (1 M KOH) and converted to the RHE scale.[32]

#### Raman Test

A working electrode was typically prepared by depositing a thin layer of chlorine-coordinated iron phthalocyanine (Cl-FePc) on a suitable conductive substrate, such as glassy carbon or gold. Then the working electrode was placed in an electrochemical cell along with a reference electrode (Ag/AgCl) and a counter electrode (platinum). The cell was then filled with an electrolyte solution containing oxygen-saturated 0.5 M KOH. The electrochemical cell was also connected to a potentiostat, and the potential of the working electrode was set to a suitable value to initiate the ORR. This potential was typically in the range of 0.0 1.0 V versus. RHE. Finally a Raman spectrometer was focused on the working electrode, and Raman spectra were collected at regular intervals during the ORR. Multiple laser wavelengths can be used to probe different regions of the sample.[33]

#### Materials and Characterization

XRD patterns were recorded on an ADX-2500 X-ray Diffraction Instrument with Cu-Kα (λ = 0.15406 nm). XPS measurements were

carried out on an AXIS UltraDLD instrument (KRATOS). Raman spectra were performed with a Renishaw confocal Raman microscope (inVia, 50 objective). (FTIR was collected through JASCO FT/IR-8X. The X-ray absorption spectra (XAS) of Fe -edge were carried out on beamline BL14W1 at National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center (NSRRC), Taiwan. We calibrated the high-resolution N1s XPS spectra to guarantee precise binding energy assignments, identifying the protonated amine (NH3 <sup>þ</sup>) at 401.5 eV and the neutral amine (C-NH2) at around 399.5 eV. Additionally, we employed external XPS calibration using Au4f (84.0 eV) or Ag3d (368.3 eV) for instrument calibration purposes.

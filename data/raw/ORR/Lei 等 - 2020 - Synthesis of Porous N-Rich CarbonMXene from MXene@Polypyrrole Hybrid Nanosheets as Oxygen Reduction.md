Noble Metal-free catalysts attracted much attention as promising candidates for Pt-based catalyst replacement to advance applications related to oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), which is critical for large-scale renewable energy storage and conversion. Herein, this work focused on a synthesis of noble metal-free ORR electrocatalysts consisting of porous N-rich carbon/MXene, which was obtained using very conductive and reactive  $Ti_3C_2$  MXene and polypyrrole (PPy) as a C and N source. The electrocatalyst exhibited excellent electrocatalytic activity and stability with an onset and a half-wave potentials equal to 0.85 and 0.71 V, respectively. Results obtained in this work demonstrate how to design efficient noble metal-free ORR electrocatalysts applicable to other chemical systems.

Alternative energy solutions as a substitution of traditional fossil fuels attracted enormous attention due to the increasing environmental concerns.<sup>1,2</sup> Fuel cells can contribute to solving this problem because they are very efficient and cause minimum pollution.<sup>3-5</sup> However, their sluggish kinetics and the large overpotential during the cathodic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) prevent their more extensive application and use.<sup>6,7</sup> Materials containing platinum (Pt) are considered the most effective ORR catalysts, but Pt is too expensive, scarce and often demonstrates poor long-term durability. Therefore, more sustainable Pt alternatives are needed for ORR catalytic reaction for fuel cells to be advanced to larger industrial scales. Several non-noble metal catalysts, including Cbased materials (such as heteroatom doped, 1,9 and N-doped C-based materials<sup>10</sup> as well as graphene<sup>11–13</sup>), are attractive alternatives because of their efficiency. In particular, N-doped carbon materials demonstrated good stability and excellent ORR electrochemical activity. Therefore, N-doped C is currently considered to be the most promising noble metal-free catalyst for ORR. Incorporation of N randomizes carbon defects, which facilitates the formation of active sites beneficial for ORR. <sup>14,15</sup> Moreover, owing to their low coat, easy synthesis and varied morphology, polyaniline (PANI) and Polypyrrole (PPy) have been broadly employed to provide N and C sources for fabrication of catalysts by pyrolysis. Additionally, due to its high gas diffusion and conduction properties of PPy and PANI, which offer a effectively route for metal-free catalyst with improved oxygen transport through ionomers.<sup>16</sup>

MXenes belong to a new family of two-dimensional transition metal carbides/carbonitrides and possess high electro-conductivity and active surface chemistries, and, as a result, show promise for energy storage  $^{17-21}$  as well as NH $_3$  sensors  $^{22}$  and ORR  $^{23-25}$  catalysts. MXenes general formula can be expressed as  $M_{n+1}X_nT_x$  (n = 1–3), where M is a transition metal, X is carbon and/or nitrogen, and  $T_x$  is a functional group (such as, O, F, and OH groups ). Currently,  $\sim\!20$  different MXene compounds with various structures and chemical compositions were synthesized.  $Ti_3C_2T_x$  was the first one discovered

and is currently the most studied MXenes member. It was synthesized by removing some Al atoms from Ti<sub>3</sub>AlC<sub>2</sub> compounds, which is a member of layered ternary carbide and nitride family called MAX. Wen et al.<sup>23</sup> validated that the MXene-supported FeNC catalysts were excellent for ORR. Liu et al. 25 used first principle calculations to understand whether O and F-terminated MXene ORR catalyst are good substitution for Pt. Their analysis involved a microscopic assessment of the  $Ti_{n+1}C_nT_x$  surface structure as well as properties as ORR catalysts. Other literature reports mostly focused on MXenes stability as a noble or conventional metal support for ORR electrocatalysis. <sup>26</sup> To date, MXenes could be as effective ORR electrocatalysts because of the following advantages: (1) the prominent metallic conductivity of 2D MXenes facilitates highly efficient charge carrier transfer; (2) the terminal metal site on the surface (e.g., Ti, Nb, V or Ta) of 2D MXenes results in stronger redox reactivity than that of other carbon-based materials; (3) 2D MXenes have high stability in aqueous media; (4) hydrophilic surface of 2D MXenes leads to strong interaction with catalytic targets or water molecules.<sup>27</sup> However, catalytic properties of MXenes by themselves were not reported to the best of our knowledge. Considering the above outstanding properties of MXenes and PPy, it is anticipated that coupled PPy and MXene Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles could be a promising electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction by taking advantage of the high electronic conductivity of MXene Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles and better activity of N-doped carbon from PPv.

Therefore, this paper describes the synthesis and performance of a novel ORR catalyst containing N-doped C and MXene obtained using a simple two-step technique. First, the MXene was coated with PPy. The resulting composite was then pyrolyzed to obtain N-doped C/MXene. Several materials with different N contents were prepared by varying pyrolysis temperature, and catalytic ORR performances of these materials were studied as a function of the N content.

(99.5%) and pyrrole (Py, 99.9%) were purchased from Aladdin Reagent Co. 20 wt% Pt/C catalyst was acquired from Shanghai Macklin Biochemical Co. Deionized (DI) water was used in all experiments.

 $Ti_3C_2T_x$  MXene synthesis.—Ti\_3C\_2T\_x MXene was synthesized using mild etching conditions described elsewhere. Specifically, 1.0 g of LiF was added to 10 ml of 12 M HCl and stirred for 5–10 min. Then, 1 g of Ti\_3AlC\_2 was slowly added to prevent excessive heating due to the vigorous carbide decomposition. After Ti\_3AlC\_2 was added, the resulting mixture was stirred at 35 °C for 24 h, after which the solid residue was collected, rinsed with DI water and centrifuged at 3500 rpm. This step was repeated until the pH of the supernatant was > 6. The powder was then ultrasonicated in DI water for 30 min under the Ar atmosphere and centrifuged for 1 h at 5200 rpm. The supernatant, which contained MXene suspension, was collected. 5 ml of this liquid was filtered, and then vacuum dried. The resulting solid was weighed, and the number as used to calculate MXene concentration in the supernatant. This information was used to obtain  $0.5 \text{ g l}^{-1}$  MXene solution.

*MXene@PPy synthesis.*—0.5 g l<sup>-1</sup> MXene solution was ultrasonicated for 1 h and then transferred into a double-layer flask with the circulating cooling pump. During the synthesis, the temperature in this flask was maintained at 2 °C. To perform in situ PPy polymerization, 1 ml of the pyrrole monomer was injected into a 0.5 g l<sup>-1</sup> MXene solution. This mixture was marked as solution A. In a separate flask, 3.89 g of FeCl<sub>3</sub>·6H<sub>2</sub>O as oxidant was ultrasonicated in 50 ml of DI water for 1 h. This orange solution was marked as solution B. The mole ratio of the pyrrole and the oxidant was set to 1:1. Solution B was added through a constant pressure drop funnel to solution A at a constant speed. The reaction was conducted at 2 °C for 6 h under constant stirring. The resulting product was filtered and rinsed several times with DI water followed by drying in a vacuum at 60 °C. The resulting material was PPy-coated MXene named throughout the paper as MXene@PPy.

**Pyrolysis of MXene@PPy.**—MXene@PPy was annealed at 700  $^{\circ}$  C, 800  $^{\circ}$ C, and 900  $^{\circ}$ C for 2 h under Ar atmosphere. The resulting samples were marked as MXene@PPy-T (T = 700, 800, and 900, respectively).

#### **Material Characterizations**

Structural and morphological characterization was performed using transmission and scanning electron microscopies (TEM and SEM, respectively) performed using JEOL 2100 and JEOL JSM-6510LA instruments, respectively. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed using UltimaIV instrument (Japan) in the 5 $^{\circ}$ -90 $^{\circ}$  2 $\theta$  range at 40 mA and 40 kV. Raman spectroscopy performed using HORIBA Lab RAM HR Evolution instrument (France) was performed using 633 nm excitation wavelength. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was conducted by the ESCA Lab 250 Thermal Scientific instrument. The Brunner-Emmet-Teller (BET) and Horvath-Kawazoe (HK) methods were used to calculate specific surface area and porosity, respectively, using BELSORP-max instrument. The thermal behaviors of the nanocomposites were assessed using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) performed by the Perkin Elmer Diamond system. The TG-MS experiments were performed using a thermogravi-metric analyzer (Netzsch STA 449 C/6/MFC/G Jupiter) coupled with an online mass spectrometer (Netzsch QMS 403) at a heating rate of 10 °C min<sup>-1</sup> from room temperature up to a final temperature of 900 °C under the helium flow rate of 50 ml min<sup>-1</sup>. The derived products were swept into the mass spectrometry through the hot capillary column connecting with the TG analyzer.

#### **Electrochemical Measurements**

Electrochemical analysis was performed using Gamry workstation containing a three-electrode cell with Pt wire, Ag/AgCl, and a catalyst-modified glassy carbon as a counter, reference and working electrodes, respectively. 5 mm (in diameter) rotating disk electrode (RDE) acted as a working electrode substrate. It was first polished by aqueous alumina suspensions and then rinsed with DI water and ethanol. To prepare a catalyst ink, 2 mg of MXene@PPy was mixed with 400  $\mu$ l of ethanol and 17.5  $\mu$ l of 5 wt% Nafion solution. The resulting MXene@PPy concentration in this homogeneous suspension was 4.79 mg ml $^{-1}$ . 10  $\mu$ l of this suspension was evenly applied onto RDE using a syringe and air-dried. The total catalyst loadings were 0.2 mg cm $^{-2}$ . Prior to the electrochemical tests, the electrolyte (which was 0.1 M KOH) inside the cell was saturated by O2 for 40 min.

Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed using the same electrolyte at 50 mV s<sup>-1</sup> scan rate. Linear sweep voltammograms (LSV) were recorded also using the same electrolyte at varying rotational speed equal to 100, 400, 900, 1600, 2000, 2025, and 2500 rpm. Chronoamperometry (conducted for 8000 s in the same electrolyte at 0.5 V vs RHE) was performed to estimate the long-term durability of the catalysts.

The ORR electron transfer number (n) was calculated by the Koutechy-Levich equation<sup>23</sup>

$$\frac{1}{j} = \frac{1}{j_L} + \frac{1}{j_K} = \frac{1}{B\omega^{1/2}} + \frac{1}{j_K},\tag{1}$$

$$B = 0.62nFC_0D_0^{2/3}v^{-1/6}$$
 [2]

where j,  $j_K$  and  $j_L$  are regular, kinetic and diffusion-limiting current densities, respectively;  $\omega$  is the rotation rate of the electrode, F is the Faraday constant equal to  $96485~\mathrm{C~mol}^{-1}$ ,  $C_o$  is  $O_2$  saturation concentration (equal to  $1.2 \times 10^{-6}\mathrm{mol~cm}^{-1}$  for  $0.1~\mathrm{M~KOH}$ ),  $D_O$  is the  $O_2$  diffusion coefficient (equal to  $1.9 \times 10^{-5}~\mathrm{cm~s}^{-1}$ ), and  $\nu$  is the kinetic viscosity of the  $0.1~\mathrm{M~KOH}$  (equal to  $0.01~\mathrm{cm}^2~\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ ).

The four-electron selectivity of catalysts was evaluated by using the RRDE technique. The potential of the Pt ring electrode in the RRDE system was set to 1.4~V vs RHE. The  $H_2O_2$  yield can be calculated from the following Eq.  $4^{29}$ 

$$H_2 O_2 \% = 200 \times \frac{I_R/N}{\frac{I_R}{N} + I_D},$$
 [3]

<span id="page-2-0"></span>Then the electron transfer number (n) can be further calculated from the following Eq. 4:

$$n = 4 \times \frac{I_D}{I_D + I_D} \tag{4}$$

Where  $I_D$  and  $I_R$  are the disk and ring currents, respectively, and N is the ring collection efficiency, equal to 0.37.

All potential values measured relative to Ag/AgCl reference electrode were transformed to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale using the Nernst equation:

$$E(RHE) = E(Ag/AgCl) + 0.0591pH + 0.197$$
 [5]

#### Results and Discussion

Steps of the MXene@PPy nanocomposite synthesis are shown in Scheme 1. First,  ${\rm Ti}_3{\rm C}_2{\rm T}_{\rm x}$  MXene nanosheets were fabricated by etching and exfoliating the MAX phase using HCl and LiF solutions. MXene@PPy was obtained after PPy was in situ polymerized directly on MXene nanosheets followed by high-temperature heating in the Ar atmosphere.

Composition and structure of the MXene@PPy catalysts.—XRD peaks of the MXene@PPy were weak (see Fig. 1a) probably because of the amorphous nature of the PPy chains, which became disordered during oxidative polymerization and heating. XRD spectrum of MXene@PPy-800 showed a peak at 26.2°, which we attributed to the (002) plane of graphite. Thus, the graphitization degree of carbon component increased after the pyrolysis. The presence of graphitic materials is beneficial for charge transfer.<sup>30</sup>

Raman spectrum of MXene@PPy showed bands at 1372 and 1583 cm<sup>-1</sup> (see Fig. 1b), which were attributed to C–N, and C=C stretching vibrations, respectively. The bands at 924 and 1078 cm<sup>-1</sup> were interpreted as C–H bending vibrations. The peak at 988 cm<sup>-1</sup> corresponded to the vibrations of the radical cation (polaron) structure, while the band at 1260 cm<sup>-1</sup> was characteristic for the polaron presence. Raman spectrum of the MXene@PPy-800 showed no bands below 1369 cm<sup>-1</sup>. Two bands at 1369 and 1598 cm<sup>-1</sup> were attributed to D- and G-bands typical for carbon-based materials, which correspond to disordered graphite and vibrations of sp<sup>2</sup> hybridized carbon atoms, respectively. The I<sub>D</sub>/I<sub>G</sub> ratio increased after the pyrolysis, which indicates the presence of more defects in the MXene@PPy-800 sample than in its precursor, MXene@PPy.<sup>31</sup>

Then, pyrolysis temperature on the Raman spectrum were investigated. The results are given in Fig. S1is (available online at stacks. iop.org/JES/167/116503/mmedia). As shown in Fig. S1,  $I_D/I_G$  value increased as the increase of carbonization temperature, indicating more defects and disordered structures were generated.

SEM of the MXene@PPy demonstrated a homogeneous PPy distribution throughout the MXene surface (see Figs. 2a and 2b). Pyrolysis treatment did not change the layer structure of the catalysts. (see Fig. 2c). Both SEM and TEM demonstrated the presence of MXene layers (see Fig. 2d), which indicates successive exfoliation of the bulk Ti<sub>3</sub>AlC<sub>2</sub> structure. MXene maintained its layered structure even after PPy surface polymerization occurred and consequent carbonization was conducted (see Figs. 2c, 2e–2h). However, the high angle annular dark-field (HAADF) micrographs and corresponding energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) mapping of an individual nanoplate of the MXene@PPy-800 sample confirmed homogeneous distribution of C and N on the MXene nanoplate, presence of which was revealed by the Ti-rich islands (see Figs. 2i –21).

High-resolution TEM demonstrated areas with lattice fringes, which probably belong to MXene (see Fig. 3). These fringes,

positioned 0.408 nm apart, were ascribed to the (001) plane of  $\rm Ti_2C_3$ . The inverse the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) image of the selective area demonstrated disordered turbostratic carbon nanodomains of MXene@PPy-800 (see in Fig. 3b), which caused the formation of free volume and micro-porosity in the carbon skeleton. Figure 3e shows our interpretation of the formed voids and pores. The  $\rm N_2$  adsorption-desorption isotherms and DFT pore size distribution (shown in Figs. 3f and 3g, respectively) revealed the hierarchical porosity and high surface area (equal to 390.5 m² g⁻¹) for MXene@PPy-800. The surface area MXene@PPy was just 28.0 m² g⁻¹ that was almost 14 times lower than Mxene@PPy-800.

Micropores in MXene@PPy-800 formed during carbonization, while meso- and macropores formed as spacings between the aggregated nanosheets.  $^{32,33}$  The large surface area of MXene@PPy-800 provided abundant active sites, while its porosity assisted in the reactants delivery. Carbonization temperature on the surface area and pore size distribution of the synthesized catalysts were studied. The results of  $N_2$  adsorption-desorption isotherms and DFT pore size distribution were illustrated in Fig. S2, and the related data were summered in Table SI. As shown in Fig.S2 and Table SI, the surface area of as-prepared catalysts improves with the increase of pyrolysis temperature from 700 °C to 900 °C, indicating the

pyrolysis temperature plays a key role in the synthesis of carbonbased ORR electrocatalysts.<sup>34</sup>

XPS of MXene@PPy showed the presence of C, N, O, and Ti elements, confirming the chemical composition corresponding to the MXene@PPy composite (see Fig. 4a). The total N content was 7.9% (see Fig. 4b). High-resolution N 1 s spectrum of MXene@PPy was deconvoluted into two peaks positioned at 399.8 and 401.9 eV, which correspond to pyrrolic and positively charged (-N+-) nitrogen,<sup>35</sup> respectively (see Fig. 4b). N 1 s spectrum of the MXene@PPy-800 showed the presence of pyridinic, pyrrolic, graphitic nitrogen and oxidized N (see Fig. 4c). Contributions of these groups to the total N content of the MXene@PPy-800 were equal to 17.62%, 11.19%, 66.33, and 4.86%, respectively (see Table I). These results indicate that high-temperature carbonization significantly affected the chemical state of nitrogen, especially graphitic N content. N atoms in the pyridinic and graphitic configuration participate in ORR as active sites. 36-39 The nitrogen atom in the pyridinic configuration possesses one lone pair of electrons as well as electrons donated to the conjugated p-bond. Thus, its presence might enhance reductive O2 adsorption and exhibit improved catalytic properties. 40 N atoms in graphitic configuration can promote the electron transfer from the C bonding orbitals to the O orbitals. 41,42 The C 1 s XPS spectrum was deconvoluted into five peaks located at 284.3, 284.9, 286.1, 287.7,

and 289.5 eV (see Fig. 4d), which were ascribed to C-Ti, C=C, C-C, C-N bonds and to disordered C, respectively. <sup>1,23</sup> We also used XPS to understand the differences in the samples pyrolyzed at different temperatures. N 1 s XPS data for the MXene@PPy-700, MXene@PPy-800, and MXene@PPy-900 samples are shown in Fig. 5 and Table I. MXene@PPy-800 material exhibited the highest content of graphitic nitrogen contents.

The thermal stability of PPy and MXene@PPy was assessed using TGA (see Fig. 6). TGA curve for the MXene@PPy was very similar to the PPy curve, which indicates its excellent thermal stability. The weight loss up to 120°C was attributed to the desorption of the loosely bonded water, while weight loss after 120 °C was due to the remove of doped anions and degradation of the PPy polymeric matrix. <sup>43</sup> According to the results of TG-MS in Fig. S3, the fragment with m/z at 36 generated from around 150 °C was probably attributed to remove of doped Cl<sup>-</sup> anions in PPy. More traces of compounds 1evolved when the temperature increased up to 600 °C, indicating the fracture of aromatic nucleus in PPy polymeric matrix. The compound fragments includes CH<sub>3</sub>, CNH, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>, and the non-hydrocarbon compounds include H<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O, and CO<sub>2</sub>.

% Pt/C catalysts, was assessed using CV. MXene@PPy-800 sample showed strong cathodic reduction peaks, which is indicative of the excellent ORR activity (see Fig. 7a). LSV of MXene@PPy-800 showed an onset potential ( $E_{oneset}$ ) equal to 0.85 V (see Fig. 7b), which is  $\sim$ 0.12 V lower than  $E_{oneset}$  of 20 wt% Pt/C electrode (equal to 0.97 V). Half-wave potential ( $E_{1/2}$ ) of MXene@PPy-800 was equal to 0.71 V, which is 0.12 V lower than  $E_{1/2}$  of the 20 wt% Pt/C electrode (equal to 0.83 V). Thus, the commercial Pt/C catalyst showed better performance than the MXene@PPy-800 catalyst very likely because of Pt presence.

ORR kinetic parameters for MXene@PPy-800 were obtained using LSV recorded at different rotating speeds. The limiting current densities increased as rotating rates increased (see Fig. 7c). The corresponding Koutecky-Levich (K-L) plots (see insert in Fig. 7d) obtained from the LSV data curves disclosed the linear relationships between  $\omega^{-\frac{1}{2}}$  and  $j^{-1}$ , and exhibited the first-order reaction kinetics. The transferred electron numbers obtained from the K-L plots for the 0.2–0.5 V range were equal to 3.4–3.95 (Fig. 7d). Thus, it is very likely that a four-electron reduction pathway for the MXene@PPy-P800 catalyst existed during the ORR rection. To

further quantify the ORR pathway, a rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) technique was used to detect peroxide species formed at the disc electrode while the potential of Pt ring electrode was set to 1.4 V vs RHE, as shown in Fig. S4. As observed from Fig. S4, the corresponding electron transfer number keeps at  $3.89\sim3.85$  and the yield of  $H_2O_2$  varies from 5.5% to 7.1% at a potential window of 0.2  $\sim0.7$  V. This further indicates a good catalytic selectivity of MXene@PPy-800 approximately equal for a four-electron reduction pathway.

Pyrolysis temperature is a vital parameter affecting final properties of the synthesized C-based ORR catalysts. <sup>10,14,43</sup> The graphitization degree, which depends on the pyrolysis temperature, strongly correlates with the ORR activity of C-based catalysts. <sup>44</sup> ORR performance parameters of the MXene@PPy-T catalysts (shown in Fig. 8) are listed in Table II. MXene@PPy-800 showed the best catalytic performance. E<sub>onset</sub> values of MXene@PPy-900 (which was equal to 0.88 V) and of MXene@PPy-800 (which was equal to 0.85) were more positive than of MXene@PPy-P700 (which was equal to 0.73 V). The half-wave potential of MXene@PPy-800 (which was equal to 0.71 V) was 170 and 80 mV more positive than

of MXene@PPy-700 and of MXene@PPy-900, respectively (which were equal to 0.54 and 0.63 V, respectively). As the pyrolysis temperature was increased, the limiting current density of the corresponding catalysts first increased from 1.73 to 3.63 mA cm $^{-2}$  and then decreased to -2.83 mA cm $^{-2}$ .

According to the results of Raman spectrum in Fig.S1 and BET in Fig. S2, although both the  $I_D/I_G$  value and surface area of MXene@PPy-900 are larger than those of MXene@PPy-800, the catalyst carbonized at 800 °C exhibits superior catalytic performance than the catalysts treated at 900 °C. XPS results described above showed that pyrrolic nitrogen content decreased as the pyrolysis temperature increased, while that of graphitic N increased significantly. Graphitic-N was considered to be more active sites for ORR, mainly because the graphitic N in the carbon structure can promote the transfer of electrons from the bonding orbital of carbon to the back-orbiting of oxygen.  $^{41,42}$  Thus, the electrochemical efficiency of our catalysts directly correlated with the graphitic nitrogen content, which agrees with similar data previously reported in the literature.  $^{36}$ 

We also compared the long-term electrochemical stability of MXene@PPy-800 and 20% Pt/C catalysts. An *i-t* response of MXene@PPy-800 and Pt/C recorded for 8000 s at 200 rpm is shown in Fig. 9. MXene@PPy-P800 catalyst exhibited better durability than commercial Pt/C catalyst: only 13.8% of the activity was lost after 8000 s of a continuous ORR. For comparison, commercial Pt/C catalyst demonstrated 5% lower activity after 8000 s.

#### Conclusions

This work demonstrated the quick and practical synthesis of a composite material consisting of N-doped carbon and MXene, which was then used as an ORR catalyst. The best composite material was obtained by sintering the precursor at 800 °C. The resulting catalyst, MXene@PPy-800, contained 9.6% of homogeneously distributed nitrogen. An onset and half-wave potentials of this catalyst during

the ORR were 0.85 and 0.71 V, respectively. Such excellent catalytic performance was attributed to the high content of graphitic nitrogen, which was equal to 80.6%. A four-electron reduction pathway during the ORR rection for the MXene@PPy-P800 catalyst were concluded from the results of RDE and RRDE measurements. The catalyst demonstrated long-term stability during ORR, which was better than that of a commercial Pt/C catalyst. Such excellent performance makes our novel catalyst a very good and sustainable candidate for the next generation full cells and metal-air batteries.

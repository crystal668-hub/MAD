**Development of cost-effective, active trifunctional catalysts for acidic oxygen reduction (ORR) as well as hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER, respectively) is highly desirable, albeit challenging. Herein, singleatomic Ru sites anchored onto Ti3C2T***x* **MXene nanosheets are first reported to serve as trifunctional electrocatalysts for simultaneously catalyzing acidic HER, OER, and ORR. A half-wave potential of 0.80 V for ORR and small overpotentials of 290 and 70 mV for OER and HER, respectively, at 10 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> are achieved. Hence, a low cell voltage of 1.56 V is required for the acidic overall water splitting. The maximum power density of an H2–O2 fuel cell using the as-prepared catalyst can reach as high as 941 mW cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> . Theoretical calculations reveal that isolated Ru–O2 sites can effectively optimize the adsorption of reactants/intermediates and lower the energy barriers for the potentialdetermining steps, thereby accelerating the HER, ORR, and OER kinetics.**

**1. Introduction**

Energy crisis and environmental pollution trigger the development of efficient and robust electrochemical energy conversion and storage technologies.[1–3] The electrocatalytic reactions, such as hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), undoubtedly play key roles in developing renewable energy conversion devices, regenerative fuel cells (based on ORR-OER-HER),[4,5] rechargeable metal-air batteries (ORR-OER),[6,7] water electrolyzers (OER-HER),[8,9] etc. The aforementioned energy systems urgently need the integration of different reactions within one device. However, quite often, a single reaction can be activated by different catalysts; yet the development of high-efficiency and lowcost trifunctional catalysts for all reactions is particularly desirable. This is because producing various catalysts for different reactions always requires different equipment and processes, which significantly increases the cost. However, high reaction barriers and sluggish kinetics of HER, OER, and ORR lead to high energy input and low output power.[10,11] Currently,

Pt and its alloys are still the most efficient electrocatalysts for acidic HER and ORR, whereas RuO2 and IrO2 are highly active toward acidic OER; however, the low-earth abundance, limited supply, and high costs also impede their industrial applications.[1] Notably, noble-metal-based materials with a single component typically fail to simultaneously exhibit high activity and durability for HER, ORR, and OER, especially in acidic environments.[12,13] Therefore, the rational design of cost-effective, active

trifunctional electrocatalysts to meet requirements of energy systems is of immense industrial and social significance.

Single-atom (SA) catalysts,[14–24] which are isolated metal sites anchored onto appropriate supports, have been reported to exhibit superior catalytic performance and high selectivity for diverse electrochemical reactions. In this regard, the development of trifunctional SA catalysts can not only considerably reduce the use of noble metals required in electrolysis but also achieve optimized electrochemical performance. Unfortunately, most of the reported trifunctional materials are non-SA catalysts,[3,11,25,26] and they are mainly active in alkaline environments. Currently, Yao et al. and Cao et al. have independently suggested that Ru SA catalysts (comprising Pt–Ru–Cu[27] ) and Ru–N4 [28] ) single sites, respectively) exhibit acidic OER performance superior or comparable to that of the state-of-the-art RuO2 and IrO2. In addition, Yang et al. have reported remarkable acidic HER activity of Ru SA coordinated by fourfold N atoms, while its performance is subpar as compared to that of Pt/C.[19] Recently, Xiao et al. have prepared a Ru–N4 single-site catalyst confined on metal-organic-framework-derived carbon and reported satisfactory acidic ORR activity.[29] Although tremendous efforts have been focused toward the exploration of Ru-SA-based catalysts in acidic electrolytes, they have been used rarely as trifunctional catalysts. Until recently, only one study has confirmed that single-atomic Ru–N4 sites can simultaneously catalyze HER, ORR, and OER.[30] However, trifunctional activities for these isolated Ru–N4 sites in an acidic system still need to be improved for practical acidic electrolysis, and studies on this issue also are extremely limited. Previous studies have reported that the coordination effect of active sites can considerably affect their electronic structures, subsequently tuning their electrocatalytic activity.[31–33] These pioneering studies have inspired us to modulate the local environment of Ru SA for improved trifunctional electrocatalytic performance, which has not been explored before, however.

MXenes, a unique family of 2D metal carbides, nitrides, or carbonitrides, have already shown great promise in energy storage and electromagnetic, photochemical, and electrochemical applications due to its excellent electronic conductivity, catalytically active basal planes with exposed metal sites, hydrophilic surface functionalities, and graphene-like unique layered structure.[34,35] In addition, MXenes not only have high surface area but also a unique features of a high reducing capability and suitable surface defects.[36] These unique features of MXene make it is expected to be an ideal candidate to support and stabilize SA catalysts.

Motivated by the above considerations, and based on our previous studies on SA catalysts,[16–18] in this study, a highly active, durable trifunctional electrocatalyst prepared by the atomic dispersion of Ru–O2 sites on ultrathin Ti3C2T*x* MXene nanosheets (denoted as Ru-SA/Ti3C2Tx) with a Ru loading of 0.23 wt% is reported. The Ru-SA/Ti3C2T*x* catalyst exhibits high activity and good stability toward HER, ORR, and OER in acidic environments, which outperform the majority of the reported trifunctional electrocatalysts (Table S2, Supporting Information). Notably, when it is applied as the anode and cathode for acidic overall water splitting (OWS), Ru-SA/Ti3C2T*x* reaches 10 mA cm−<sup>2</sup> at a small cell voltage of 1.56 V, demonstrating promise for its potential implementation in proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolysis. Meanwhile, Ru-SA/Ti3C2T*x* exhibits good performance in an H2–O2 PEM fuel cell with a peak power density of 941 mW cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> , which approaches the state-of-the-art values (Table S3, Supporting Information). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were conducted to obtain an in-depth understanding of the structure–activity relationship.

## **2. Results and Discussion**

## **2.1. Preparation and Characterization of the Ru-SA/Ti3C2T***x* **Catalyst**

**Figure 1**a shows the schematic of the synthesis of Ru-SA/ Ti3C2T*x*, where RuCl3 is reduced to single-atomic Ru sites immobilized on Ti3C2T*x* MXene nanosheets (More details have been provided in the Experimental Section). Figure 1b shows the X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) pattern of Ru-SA/Ti3C2T*x*, confirming the absence of peaks characteristic of Ru nanocrystals in Ru-SA/Ti3C2T*x*. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images (Figure 1c,d) revealed the absence of Ru nanoparticles or clusters on Ru-SA/ Ti3C2T*x*, which is in accordance with the XRD analysis results.

Figure 1e and Figure S1 (Supporting Information) show the aberration-corrected high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) images: Abundant bright spots corresponding to single-atomic Ru sites are uniformly dispersed clearly on Ti3C2T*x* MXene nanosheets. Furthermore, as shown in STEM-energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) mapping in Figure 1f–i, Ru is uniformly distributed on the Ti3C2T*x* MXene nanosheet surface. In addition, the Ru content is 0.23 wt%, as determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). In addition, Ru nanoparticles supported on Ti3C2T*x* MXene nanosheets (denoted as Ru-NP/Ti3C2T*x*) with a Ru content of 3.5 wt% are prepared for comparison (Figures S2–S4, Supporting Information).

Next, extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) and X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) measurements were performed to probe the local atomistic and electronic structures of Ru-SA/Ti3C2T*x*. The oxidation state of the Ru species can be probed by the location of the absorption edge from the Ru L3-edge XANES spectra. The Ru XANES result revealed that the absorption edge of Ru-SA/Ti3C2T*x* is located between those of Ru foil and RuO2 (**Figure 2**a and Figure S5, Supporting Information), indicating that the average valence for the Ru species in Ru-SA/Ti3C2T*x* is situated between Ru<sup>0</sup> and Ru4<sup>+</sup>. [28] In the Ru Fourier transform EXAFS (FT-EXAFS) of Ru-SA/Ti3C2T*x*, the main peak is observed at ≈1.50 Å (Figure 2b), which is 38% less than the RuRu bond length for the Ru foil (2.42 Å);[19] this result is in agreement with the HAADF-STEM characterization described above (Figure 1e and Figure S1, Supporting Information). Furthermore, the wavelet transform (WT)-EXAFS contour plot of Ru-SA/Ti3C2T*x* exhibits only one intensity maximum at 4.6 Å−<sup>1</sup> , corresponding to RuO bonding. Moreover, WT-EXAFS signals corresponding to the RuRu contribution are not observed for Ru-SA/Ti3C2T*x*, but these signals are observed in the plots of the Ru foil and RuO2.

Previously, single metal atoms were stabilized at the sites preferentially occupied by Ti due to strong metal–carbon www.advancedsciencenews.com www.small-journal.com

(namely, M–C) interactions with the  $Ti_3C_2T_x$  MXene support. [37] Hence, M-C, and M-Ti bonds are observed in FT-EXAFS. Notably, a Ru-Ti bond is not detected herein.[37] Considering that the Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>r</sub> MXene surface is rich in oxygen-containing groups (such as OH<sup>-</sup> and O<sup>2-</sup>) and that these functional groups are negatively charged,[38,39] which can provide anchoring sites for stabilizing metal atoms, it is reasonable to speculate that single-atomic Ru sites in Ru-SA/Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> are captured by oxygen-containing groups, thereby forming Ru-O bonds. To determine the quantitative chemical configuration of the Ru atom, the EXAFS fitting was performed to extract the structure parameters of Ru centers. According to the fitting results shown in Figure 2d and Table S1 (Supporting Information), the first shell of the Ru atom in the Ru-SA/Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> has a coordination number of two and a main bond length of 2.12 Å (inset of Figure 2d). The proposed structure of the Ru $-O_2$  (inset of Figure 2d) was in agreement with the fitting results. Furthermore, surface chemical constitution and electron state of the catalysts were investigated using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Figure 2e and Figure S6, Supporting Information). From the high-resolution spectrum of Ru 3d (Figure 2e), the peaks observed at 284.8 and 282.0 eV can be assigned to Ru3+, further confirming the atomic dispersion of the Ru sites.<sup>[40]</sup>

#### 2.2. HER Performance in Acidic Media

Acidic HER electrolysis was examined in a 0.1 M HClO<sub>4</sub> electrolyte under ambient conditions using a standard three-electrode

setup with the obtained materials as the working electrodes, Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode, and a graphite rod as the counter electrode. Figure 3a shows the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves of Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub>, Ru-NP/Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub>, Ru-SA/Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub>, and 20 wt% Pt/C, in which Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub>, Ru-NP/Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub>, and Pt/C are considered as reference samples. Clearly, Ru-SA/Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> exhibits a higher current density (j) and a lower current onset potential than those of Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> and Ru-NP/Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub>, indicating that single-atomic Ru sites can substantially boost the acidic HER activity. Ru-SA/Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> requires a  $\eta_{10}$  (overpotential at a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>) of 70 mV, which is considerably better than those of Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> and Ru-NP/Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> (411 and 176 mV, respectively) and approaches that of Pt/C (62 mV). To the best of our knowledge, this represents one of the most promising catalysts with such high acidic HER activity (Table S4, Supporting Information). Besides, the LSV results normalized by the noble-metal mass afford mass activities (MA) of 0.46 and 6.62 A  $mg_{Ru}^{-1}$  for Ru-NP/Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> and Ru-SA/Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub>, respectively, and 0.08 A mg<sub>Pt</sub><sup>-1</sup> for Pt/C (Figure 3b). These values represent superior catalytic behavior over most of the best-reported electrocatalysts (Table S4, Supporting Information).

The Tafel plots afford a smaller slope of 27.7 mV dec<sup>-1</sup> for Ru-SA/Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> compared with those of Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub>, Ru-NP/ Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub>, and Pt/C (361.2, 75.8, and 31.6 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>, respectively) (Figure 3c), revealing more favorable HER kinetics with the single-atomic Ru sites. [16,32] The lower Tafel slope suggests that the Tafel reaction (electrochemical desorption step) is the rate-determining step, and the HER catalyzed by this Ru-SA/  $Ti_3C_2T_x$  electrocatalyst proceeds via the Tafel mechanism. [41]

Moreover, this result suggested that the electrochemical desorption step (Heyrovsky step) on Ru-SA/Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> is the rate-determining step. [42] Meanwhile, as estimated from the Tafel plots, the exchange current density ( $j_0$ ) of Ru-SA/Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> is found to be 0.06 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. Additionally, the electrochemical surface area was determined by measuring the double-layer capacitance ( $C_{\rm dl}$ ) from cyclic voltammetry (CV) studies (Figure S7, Supporting Information). [13] Ru-SA/Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> exhibits a higher  $C_{\rm dl}$  (191.1 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>) than those of Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> and Ru-NP/Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> (43.5 and 80.7 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>, respectively), indicating that the acidic HER activity for Ru-SA/Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> is remarkably improved mainly related to the existence of Ru SAs. [19]

To further investigate the intrinsic catalytic activity of Ru-SA/Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub>, the turnover frequency (TOF), [25,42,43] a figure-of-merit that is independent of the surface area, is calculated according to our previous study (Figure 3d and Figures S8a and S9a, Supporting Information). Notably, the calculated TOF of Ru-SA/Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> is 2.67 H<sub>2</sub> s<sup>-1</sup> ( $\eta$  = 100 mV), which is significantly greater than those of Ru-NP/Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> and Pt/C (0.18 and 1.29 H<sub>2</sub> s<sup>-1</sup>, respectively). This result clearly revealed the superior intrinsic electrocatalytic performance of Ru-SA/Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> for HER electrolysis.

Finally, the durability of  $Ru-SA/Ti_3C_2T_x$  was examined by polarization cycling and chronopotentiometric tests: No clear degradation in the catalytic activity is observed, confirming

its superior stability toward acidic electrolysis (Figure 3e,f). Additional HAADF-STEM and XPS analyses of the used catalyst after the durability test revealed that the atomic dispersed Ru sites are still preserved (Figures S10 and S11, Supporting Information).

#### 2.3. OER Performance in Acidic Media

Next, the acidic OER performance of Ru-SA/Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> was investigated. As can be observed from the LSV results shown in Figure 4a, Ru-SA/Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> exhibits the highest activity, requiring a  $\eta_{10}$  of 290 mV; this value is less than those observed for Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub>, Ru-NP/Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub>, and IrO<sub>2</sub> (770, 440, and 330 mV, respectively). The small  $\eta_{10}$  value renders Ru-SA/Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> as one of the most active acidic OER electrocatalysts (Table S5, Supporting Information). Furthermore, Ru-SA/Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> exhibits a remarkable MA of 6.86 A  $mg_{Ru}^{-1}$  at a  $\eta$  of 290 mV (Figure 4b); this value is 57 and 686 times relative to that for Ru-NP/Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub>  $(0.12 \text{ A mg}_{Ru}^{-1})$  and  $IrO_2$   $(0.01 \text{ A mg}_{Ir}^{-1})$ . The lower Tafel slope for Ru-SA/Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> (Figure 4c, 37.9 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>) compared with those for Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub>, Ru-NP/Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub>, and IrO<sub>2</sub> (130.2, 89.8, and 93.5 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>, respectively) suggested its rapid OER kinetics.<sup>[28]</sup> The lower Tafel slope can be associated with an electron transfer rate-determining step.[44]

Next, TOF was calculated to examine the intrinsic OER activity of Ru-SA/Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub>: A TOF value of 3.01 O<sub>2</sub> s<sup>-1</sup>  $(\eta = 370 \text{ mV})$  is obtained (Figure 4d and Figures S8b and S9b, Supporting Information). This value is significantly greater than that of  $IrO_2$  (1.51  $O_2$  s<sup>-1</sup>), and it is among the best reported values (Table S5, Supporting Information). In addition, the asprepared Ru-SA/Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> exhibits excellent stability for acidic OER under harsh conditions. The chronopotentiometric test revealed a negligible decrease over 32 h electrolysis, and the LSV curves after 2000 cycles remain almost the same as those prior to the test (Figure 4e,f). Meanwhile, the Ru loading of the Ru-SA/Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> catalyst after 32 h electrolysis is determined to be 0.21 wt%, further confirming its rigorous stability. This finding can be ascribed to the strong interaction between Ru SAs and Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> MXene support, [28,30] which is beneficial to stabilize the Ru SAs during electrolysis.

#### 2.4. OWS Performance in Acidic Media

Considering the high activity and stability of Ru-SA/Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> toward HER and OER, its acidic OWS performance in a two-electrode electrolyzer was investigated (**Figure 5**a) by using commercially IrO<sub>2</sub> and Pt/C as benchmark references. [45] Ru-SA/Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> still exhibits superior activity for OWS (Figure 5b), requiring a cell voltage of 1.56 V to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>; this value is less than that on Pt/ClIrO<sub>2</sub> (1.75 V). Notably, this cell voltage is also comparable to that of most of the best OWS catalysts reported recently (Table S6, Supporting Information). Meanwhile, it should be emphasized that the Ru loading of Ru-SA/Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> is as low as 0.23 wt%, which can considerably reduce the cost compared to the state-of-the-art Ru- or Ir-based acidic OWS catalysts (Table S6, Supporting Information).

Next, the faradaic efficiency (FE) of a home-made water electrolyzer was examined via the collection of evolved gaseous products over the cathode and anode (Figure S12, Supporting Information). Only H<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> products with a molar ratio close to 2:1 are detected (Figure 5c), and the FE is measured to be 98.9% during acidic water electrolysis, confirming the high efficiency of the OWS system. Given such an excellent catalytic performance, this electrolyzer can be easily driven by an AA battery with a nominal voltage of 1.5 V (Figure S13, Supporting Information). Moreover, this electrolyzer can retain outstanding acidic OWS activity with no noticeable decay over 32 h electrolysis (Figure 5d).

#### 2.5. ORR Performance in Acidic Media

In addition to the high efficiency and durability for HER, OER, and OWS, Ru-SA/Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> was an efficient electrocatalyst for acidic ORR. As can be observed from the LSV and CV results in Figure 6a and Figure S14 (Supporting Information), Ru-SA/Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> exhibits the highest activity with the most positive onset potential ( $E_{\text{onset}}$ ) of 0.92 V versus RHE and an  $E_{1/2}$  of 0.80 V versus RHE, which are similar to those of Pt/C  $(E_{\text{onset}} = 0.92 \text{ V} \text{ and } E_{1/2} = 0.82 \text{ V}, \text{ respectively}). \text{ Notably, both}$ of them ( $E_{\text{onset}}$  and  $E_{1/2}$ ) are one of the highest among all the recent reported acidic ORR catalysts (Table S7, Supporting Information). Notably, the  $E_{1/2}$  value obtained for Pt/C is comparable to that reported previously (Table S7, Supporting Information), indicating that the experimental ORR measured herein is reliable. At the  $E_{1/2}$  (Figure S15, Supporting Information), the corresponding MA value of Ru-SA/Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> (1.77 A mg<sub>Ru</sub><sup>-1</sup>) is 89 and 15 times larger than that of Pt/C (0.02 A mg<sub>Pt</sub><sup>-1</sup>) and Ru-NP/Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> (0.12 A mg<sub>Ru</sub><sup>-1</sup>), suggestive of significant economic importance.

Figure 6b shows the ORR LSV curves recorded at different rotation speeds (from 400 to 2500 rpm). Meanwhile, the Koutecky-Levich (K-L) plots derived from the LSV results exhibit good linearity at various potentials (Figure 6b, inset), indicative of the first-order reaction kinetics with respect to the O2 concentration and a potential-independent electron transfer rate.[14] In addition, as calculated from the K-L plots, the average electron transfer number for Ru-SA/Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>r</sub> is 3.82, implying a 4e<sup>-</sup> reduction pathway under acidic conditions. [46] Furthermore, Ru-SA/Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> exhibits a lower Tafel slope of 60.4 mV dec<sup>-1</sup> than those observed for Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub>, Ru-NP/  $Ti_3C_2T_x$ , and Pt/C (172.5, 103.6, and 87.0 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>, respectively) (Figure 6c), indicating that the Ru-SA Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> has a rapid first electron transfer step in the ORR system. [47,48] The kinetic current (jk) for Ru-SA/Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> at 0.70 V versus RHE is calculated to be -4.98 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> (Figure S16, Supporting Information); this value is greater than those on  $Ti_3C_2T_x$  (-0.26 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>) and Ru-NP/Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> ( $-0.04 \text{ mA cm}^{-2}$ ).

Test conditions: 1 bar  $H_2$ – $O_2$  at a flow rate of 300 mL min<sup>-1</sup>; MEA active area: 1.0 cm<sup>2</sup>; Nafion 211 membrane; 100% relative humidity; cathode loading: 4.0 mg cm<sup>-2</sup>; anode loading: 40 wt% Pt/ C (0.4 mg<sub>Pt</sub> cm<sup>-2</sup>).

The accelerated durability test was examined by chrono-amperometric electrolysis and potential cycling. Ru-SA/  $Ti_3C_2T_x$  exhibits durability superior to that of Pt/C during 32 h electrolysis (Figure 6d). Besides, the  $E_{1/2}$  of Ru-SA/  $Ti_3C_2T_x$  exhibits a marginal negative shift after 2000 cycles,  $\approx 11$  mV (Figure 6e), further confirming its excellent stability. Notably, in 0.1 M HClO<sub>4</sub> + 0.1 M methanol, Ru-SA/ $Ti_3C_2T_x$  exhibits a negligible fuel-crossover effect (Figure S17, Supporting Information).

To confirm the active sites, the atomic dispersed Ru species in Ru-SA/Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> were poisoned by the addition of SCN<sup>-</sup>, and then their ORR LSV curves were compared. [18,39] The acidic ORR activity of Ru-SA/Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> distinctly decreases in the presence of SCN<sup>-</sup>, as evidenced by more negative  $E_{\rm onset}$  (0.77 V vs RHE) and  $E_{\rm 1/2}$  (0.64 V vs RHE) (Figure S18, Supporting Information). This result clearly elucidated that the efficient ORR performance of Ru-SA/Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> originates from single-atomic Ru sites.

Furthermore, the  $H_2$ – $O_2$  PEMFC performance was investigated using  $O_2$  and  $H_2$  with a pressure of 1 bar for each at 80 °C. [49] Membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) comprised Ru-SA/Ti $_3$ C $_2$ T $_x$  and Pt/C as the cathodic catalyst for ORR and anodic catalyst for  $H_2$  oxidation, respectively (More details have been provided in the Experimental Section). Figure 6f shows the PEM fuel cell polarization curve: Ru-SA/Ti $_3$ C $_2$ T $_x$  exhibits current densities of 2.35 A cm $^{-2}$  at 0.4 V. As calculated from the polarization curve, the peak power density of Ru-SA/

 ${
m Ti}_3{
m C}_2{
m T}_x$  is up to 941 mW cm<sup>-2</sup> at 0.38 V (Figure 6f), exceeding those of most of the previously reported best catalysts used in precious-metal-catalyst-supported PEM fuel cells (Table S3, Supporting Information).

The above results suggested that the presence of abundant atomically dispersed  $Ru\text{--}O_2$  sites is responsible for the significant performance enhancement, as will be discussed later. Moreover, compared to the reported Ru SA catalysts (including single-, dual-, or trifunctional catalysts),  $^{[15,16,19,20,27,29,50]}$  our designed Ru single-site catalyst exhibits a competitive advantage in acidic media (Details have been provided in Tables S2–S7, Supporting Information), highlighting the importance of engineering the coordination environment of a single site on its catalytic activity.

#### 2.6. Theoretical Insights into the Structure-Activity Relationship

To reveal the underlying reason for the high activities of Ru-SA/Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> toward acidic HER, OER, and ORR, DFT calculations were conducted (Details have been provided in the Experimental Section). Figure S19 (Supporting Information) shows the optimized models of H adsorbed on the Ru-SA/Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> and Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> surfaces. The bond length  $d_{\text{Ru-H}}$  is 1.64 Å for Ru-SA/Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub>, while for Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub>, the  $d_{\text{O-H}}$  changes to 0.975 Å. The short O–H bond length implies a strong bond energy on the Ru-SA/Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> surface, [51] which in turn makes

the H\* desorption unfavorable. Furthermore, the Gibbs free energy (│Δ*G*H\*│) for the adsorption of intermediate hydrogen on Ru-SA/Ti3C2T*x* is 0.11 eV (**Figure 7**a), which is less than those on Ti3C2T*x* (0.13 eV) as well as very close to that on Pt (111) (0.09 eV), indicative of the favorable H adsorption–desorption and subsequently H2 production characteristics of Ru-SA/Ti3C2T*x*, enabling it to effectively drive the overall HER process.[42] This theoretical prediction corroborates with the experimental results (Figure 3a).

Moreover, as depicted by the projected density of states (PDOS) in Figure 7b, Ru-SA/Ti3C2T*x* exhibits higher occupied states than pristine Ti3C2T*x* near the Fermi level, corresponding to the promoted electron transport, subsequently leading to enhanced conductivity;[39] this result was further verified by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) (Figure S20, Supporting Information). The difference between Ru-SA/Ti3C2T*x* and Ti3C2T*x* is attributed to the presence of Ru d orbitals, suggesting that the decoration of single-atomic Ru sites can effectively promote the domination of d-electrons near the Fermi level, thereby leading to enhanced electrocatalytic activity.

Figure S21 (Supporting Information) shows the proposed four-electron mechanism of acidic OER and the corresponding optimized adsorption configurations of the intermediates on Ru-SA/Ti3C2T*x*. In principle, the difference in the adsorption energies between Δ*G*O\* and Δ*G*OH\* is suggested to be a descriptor for estimating the catalytic capability for OER.[52] Ru-SA/Ti3C2T*x* exhibits a lower Δ*G*O\*−Δ*G*OH\* value

(0.47 eV) than that of Ti3C2T*x* (1.95 eV), implying facilitated reaction kinetics on Ru-SA/Ti3C2T*x* (Figure 7c). This result is in good agreement with the abovementioned OER performance (Figure 4a). For the OER pathway, which involves proton-coupled electron transfer steps and the intermediates of \*OH, \*O, and \*OOH.[53,54] Therefore, the OER activities are mainly evaluated by the energetics of the intermediates (\*OH, \*O, and \*OOH) on the catalyst surfaces, which is demonstrated by the previous studies.[55] In this work, the Gibbs free energies of the OER over the Ti3C2T*x* and Ru-SA/Ti3C2T*x* were calculated and provided in Figure 7c. As shown, the formation of \*O2 species (Δ*G* = 0.85 eV) from \*OOH species over the Ru-SA/Ti3C2T*<sup>x</sup>* requires the largest energy input, which is regarded as the potential-determining step (PDS) in the Ru-SA/Ti3C2T*x* system for OER. For the Ti3C2T*x* system, the PDS (Δ*G* = 1.95 eV) occurred at the formation of O\* from OH\*, which was larger than that of Ru-SA/Ti3C2T*x*, confirming that single-atomic Ru sites are beneficial for acidic OER. Interestingly, although the O2 desorption is strongly hindered by the single Ru site, in electrolysis, the generated O2 can easily be dissolved in the electrolyte, and thereby allowing for the availability of the Ru site for next catalytic cycle.[56]

Finally, according to the free energetics in Figure 7d and the ORR pathway in Figure S22 (Supporting Information), for Ru-SA/Ti3C2T*x*, the first five elementary reactions are energetically favorable. However, for Ti3C2T*x*, the formation of \*OOH is the PDS in this reaction pathway, with a barrier of 1.23 eV (Figure 7d). As seen, the H2O formation step displays different energy requirements for Ru-SA/Ti3C2T*x* and Ti3C2T*x*. H2O formation is thermodynamically favorable for Ti3C2T*x* with an exothermic energy barrier of 1.66 eV, while that for Ru-SA/Ti3C2T*<sup>x</sup>* is unfavorable, with an endothermic energy barrier of 0.33 eV (Figure 7d). This implies that the H2O formation step is the PDS for ORR on Ru-SA/Ti3C2T*x*. Thus compared with Ti3C2T*<sup>x</sup>* with a PDS energy barrier of 1.23 eV, Ru-SA/Ti3C2T*x* shows an enhanced ORR activity, which is in line with experimental results (Figure 6a). All DFT calculations revealed the presence of single dispersed Ru–O2 sites, leading to superior acidic HER, OER, and ORR behaviors of Ru-SA/Ti3C2T*x*, as demonstrated by the above electrochemical performances.

## **3. Conclusion**

Exploring high-efficiency and robust trifunctional catalysts for HER, OER, and ORR under strong acidic environments is attractive but still challenging. In this work, highly stable single-atomic Ru sites immobilized on ultrathin Ti3C2T*x* MXene nanosheets were rationally designed. Strikingly, the newly developed single-site catalyst exhibited 1) outstanding HER activity (e.g., a *η*10 of 70 mV and a TOF of 2.67 H2 s<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> ) and Ptlike catalytic kinetics and durability, surpassing those of most of the best-reported catalysts; 2) superior OER performance with a *η*10 of 290 mV and a Tafel slope of 37.9 mV dec<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> . Furthermore, potential applications of OER/HER bifunctional catalysts of practical significance of acidic OWS have been confirmed, achieving a cell voltage of 1.56 V at 10 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2; and 3) remarkable ORR behavior (e.g., an *E*1/2 of 0.80 V, MA of 1.77 A mgRu<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> , and *J*k of −4.98 mA cm−<sup>2</sup> ) and an ignorable fuel-crossover effect. In addition, the catalyst exhibited an extremely high PEMFC activity, which can reach as high as 941 mW cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> . Experimental and theoretical calculations revealed that the presence of singleatomic Ru–O2 sites is responsible for the efficient activity in acid electrolytes, which can optimize the adsorption of reactants/intermediates, making HER, OER, and ORR pathways on the designed catalyst an energetically favorable process. Results from previously reported Ru SA catalysts again highlighted the scientific significance of the atomic-scale modulation of active sites to tailor and optimize their electrocatalytic performance. In addition, the work will open up new avenues for the development of other high-performance trifunctional SA catalysts.

Non-noble transition metal (TM) complexes have attracted  $_{58}$  of d- $\pi$  conjugation effect. 37 strength can be achieved by modulating the active d orbitals.

Abstract: Non-noble transition metal complexes have attracted 38 For representative TM complex catalysts such as TM porphyrin-2 growing interest as efficient electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction 39 based catalysts, d<sub>2</sub>2 orbitals are commonly considered as the 3 reaction (ORR) while their activities still lack rational and effective 40 main active orbitals, [8-9] Efforts are directed to regulating the 4 regulation. Herein, we propose a d-π conjugation strategy for rough 41 energy level of d<sub>2</sub>2 orbitals for higher electrocatalytic activity. [10] s and fine tuning of ORR activity of TM-BTA (TM = Mn/Fe/Co/Ni/Cu, 42 The d<sub>XZ</sub> / d<sub>VZ</sub> orbitals of catalysts (e.g., FeN<sub>4</sub>-C<sub>8</sub>) are also <sub>6</sub> BTA = 1,2,4,5-benzenetetramine) coordination polymers. By first-<sub>43</sub> demonstrated active in interaction with adsorbates.<sup>[11-13]</sup> As for d-7 principle calculations, we elucidate that the strong d-π conjugation 44 π conjugated complexes, the strong hybridization between d<sub>xx</sub>/d<sub>vz</sub>  $_8$  elevates the  $d_{yy}/d_{yz}$  orbitals of TM centers to enhance intermediate  $_{45}$  and  $\pi$  orbitals, which is merely considered to improve the material  $_{9}$  adsorption and strengthens the electronic modulation effect from  $_{46}$  conductivity, [14-15] would elevate the  $d_{xz}$  /  $d_{vz}$  orbitals. The 10 substitute groups on ligands. Based on this strategy, Co-TABQ 47 combined effect of d<sub>2</sub>2 and d<sub>XZ</sub> / d<sub>VZ</sub> orbitals is envisioned to 11 (tetramino benzoquinone) is found to approach the top of ORR activity 48 strengthen the activity of TM centers, thus improving the ORR 12 volcano. The synthesized Co-TABQ with atomically distributed Co on 49 activity for TM centers with weak adsorption. Moreover, the strong 13 carbon nanotubes exhibits a half-wave potential of 0.85 V and a 50 d-π conjugation enables fine tuning of ORR activity by tailoring 14 specific current of 127 mA mg<sub>metal</sub>-1 at 0.8 V, outperforming the 51 the π electronic structure of ligands, which however remains 15 benchmark Pt/C. The high activity, low peroxide yield, and 52 elusive. Among TM complexes, TM-1,2,4,5-benzenetetramine 16 considerable durability of Co-BTA and Co-TABQ promise their 53 (BTA) coordination polymers featuring the smallest conjugated 17 application in oxygen electrocatalysis. This study provides 54 ligands endow strong d-π conjugation and allow flexible 18 mechanistic insight into the rational design of transition metal complex 55 substituent modification. Therefore, TM-BTAs are a promising 56 new family of ORR electrocatalysts and attractive model catalysts 57 for studying the structure-activity relationship from the perspective

21 growing interest as potential alternatives to Pt-based 59 Herein, we report the synthesis and electrocatalytic application 22 electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) due to their of TM-BTAs and propose a two-step strategy to optimize the ORR 23 low cost, high elemental abundance, well-defined active sites and 61 activity of TM-BTA analogs by screening preliminarily central TM 24 considerable performance.[1-2] To improve the electrocatalytic 62 ions and subsequently substituent groups. A series of TM-BTA 25 activity of TM complexes, extensive attempts have been paid to 63 (TM = Mn/Fe/Co/Ni/Cu) catalysts are designed to evaluate their 26 selecting TM centers and ligand species or restructuring the 64 electrocatalytic activities. Among them, Co-BTA shows the lowest 27 coordination configurations to optimize adsorption strength for 65 overpotential and its activity can be further enhanced by modifying 28 oxygen-containing species (i.e., \*OOH, \*O and \*OH), [3-5] However, 66 electron-donating substituents such as CH<sub>3</sub>, OCH<sub>3</sub> and O. First-29 it remains challenging to approach the top of the ORR activity 67 principle calculations indicate that oxygen-modified Co-BTA (Co-30 volcano by separately altering the central TM ions or ligands due 68 TABQ, TABQ = tetramino-benzoquinone) is the most catalytically 31 to the limitation in the modulation of the adsorption energy of 69 active as a result of optimized adsorption strength for 32 intermediates involved in oxygen electrocatalysis. [6] According to 70 intermediates. Experimentally, the synthesized Co-BTA and Co-33 the Sabatier principle, neither too strong nor too weak adsorption 71 TABQ feature atomically dispersed Co sites and can be 34 of oxygen-containing species on catalysts is desirable for the 72 homogenously coated on carbon nanotubes (CNTs). Remarkably, 35 ORR. Since electrocatalytic activity of TM complexes correlates 73 Co-TABQ@CNTs catalyze 4-electron ORR with a half-wave <sub>36</sub> with d orbital distribution of TM centers,<sup>[7]</sup> a preferable adsorption <sup>74</sup> potential of 0.85 V (vs. RHE) and specific current of 127 mA g<sup>-1</sup> <sub>75</sub> 1<sub>metal</sub> at 0.8 V, outperforming Co-BTA@CNT<sub>S</sub> and Pt/C. This study <sup>76</sup> unravels the d-π conjugation effect on oxygen electrocatalysis 77 and enlightens the design of TM-BTA as a family of efficient ORR

> The TM-BTA series are designed by adjusting TM centers and 80 ligand substituents (Figure 1a). We first screen TM centers, which serve as active sites, to roughly tune the ORR activity of TM-BTA. 82 Based on the scaling relationship between Gibbs adsorption free  $_{83}$  energies of \*OOH ( $\Delta G_{^{+}OOH}$ ) and \*OH ( $\Delta G_{^{+}OH}$ ) (Figure S1), the 84 overpotential (n) can be described by two independent  $_{85}$  descriptors,  $\Delta G_{^{+}OH}$  and  $(\Delta G_{^{+}O}$  -  $\Delta G_{^{+}OH})$  as displayed in the color-86 filled maps (Figure 1b).

1 analogs exhibit a volcano relationship, where the electrocatalysts 33 manifests the highest activity with a 0.19 V lower overpotential  $_4$  potential-limiting steps (PLS), including  $O_2 \rightarrow {}^*OOH$  (region 1),  $_{36}$  A strong hybridization between  $\pi$  orbitals of BTA ligands and

14 located at region 3 and 4, respectively. The inappropriate 15 adsorption strengths for intermediates limit the ORR activities of 16 Mn-BTA and Fe-BTA, which have large η of 0.77 and 0.65 V, 17 respectively. In contrast, Ni-BTA and Cu-BTA show much weak 18 adsorption strength for intermediates and locate at region 1 with 19 unfavorable activity (Figure 1b and S2). Among the series, Co-20 BTA allows a moderate intermediate stabilization (Figure S3 and 21 S4), thus exhibiting the highest onset potential (E<sub>onset</sub>) of 0.72 V 22 (Figure S5). Accordingly, the activity volcano top is closer to Co-23 based catalysts, rather than Fe-based catalysts as previously 24 reported.[6,16]

Although Co-BTA exhibits decent ORR activity, there is still a 26 large gap between Co-BTA and the activity volcano top (Figure 27 1b). To narrow this gap, diverse substituents are introduced into 28 Co-BTA. As shown in Figure 1c and Figure S6, the electron-29 donating substituents including CH<sub>3</sub>, OCH<sub>3</sub> and O enhance the 30 ORR by increasing electron density in the conjugated system, 31 while the electron-withdrawing substituents such as CN, Cl and 32 CF<sub>3</sub> exert opposite effect. Among the analogs, Co-TABQ

2 closer to volcano top possess higher activity. The volcano can be 34 relative to Co-BTA. These results reveal that substituent 3 divided into four regions, which are respectively ruled by four 35 modification is effective to fine-tune the ORR activity of TM-BTA.

The  $_{38}$  delocalized ligand  $\pi$  electrons are incorporated with TM  $d_{xz}/d_{yz}$ Altering TM centers can dramatically change the ORR activity 39 orbitals to enhance bonding of intermediates. Commonly, the d<sub>2</sub>2 s of TM-BTA (Figure 1b), as different TM centers render varied 40 orbitals in TM-N4 are considered more active than dxz/dyz orbitals 9 adsorption strength, which increases in the order of Cu-BTA < Ni- 41 due to the more z component and higher energy level. In Co-BTA,  $_{10}$  BTA < Co-BTA < Fe-BTA < Mn-BTA (Figure S2). Owing to the  $^{V}$   $_{42}$  the  $d_{xz}/d_{yz}$  degenerate orbitals are found partially unoccupied excess adsorption strength, \*O or \*OH on Mn/Fe-BTA possesses 43 according to the spin charge density (Figure 2b). Thus, the d<sub>xz</sub>/d<sub>vz</sub> 12 an extremely low energy level, imposing enhanced difficulty in the 44 orbitals of Co uncommonly possess higher energy level than d<sub>2</sub>2 13 subsequent hydrogenation. As a result, Mn-BTA and Fe-BTA are 45 orbital, which is further confirmed by the projected density of 46 states (PDOS) shown in Figure 2c. The much broad distribution 47 of states also suggests strong delocalization of d<sub>xz</sub>/d<sub>yz</sub> electrons, 48 which is attributed to the strong hybridization between pz orbitals  $_{\rm 49}$  of ligands and  $d_{xz}/d_{yz}$  orbitals of Co. Such orbital energy order 50 differs from that in Co-tetraphenylporphyrin COFs, of which d<sub>72</sub> is 51 the main active orbital (Figure S7). Similar characteristics are 52 found in other TM-BTA (TM = Mn/Fe/Ni/Cu) compounds (Figure 53 S8). The unique coordination geometry of TM-BTA activates and  $_{54}$  widens the distribution of  $d_{\chi z}/d_{\chi z}$  orbitals with elevated energy  $_{55}$  level (Figure 2d). The activated  $d_{\chi Z}/d_{\chi Z}$  and  $d_{\chi Z}$  orbitals co-56 determine the adsorption strength for intermediates, as indicated 57 by their hybridization with p orbitals of OOH (Figure 2e and S9). <sub>58</sub> This joint participation of  $d_{xz}/d_{yz}/d_{_{7}2}$  orbitals in Co-BTA is 59 confirmed by the partial unoccupied antibonding states, different 60 from that of Co-tetraphenylporphyrin COFs (Figure S10).

As shown in Figure 2f, the p orbitals of substituent groups can interact with the π orbitals of ligands and further affect the  $d_{xz}/d_{yz}$  orbitals of Co via d-π conjugation. To further understand the moderating effect of substituents, differential charge density of \*O is on Co-BTA after substituting CI and O groups is plotted in Figure 2g. The electron-donating substituent results in an increase in charge density around  $p_x/p_y$  orbitals of \*O and thus strengthens the intermediate adsorption, whereas the electron-withdrawing substituent weakens the Co-O π bond. The increase of charge density in conjugated system of Co-TABQ is shown in Figure S11. Therefore, tailoring the d-π conjugation via substituent 22 modification in BTA ligand is viable to effectively regulate the 23 activity of Co sites in Co-BTA.

The TM-BTA series were synthesized via a facile complexation 25 of TM cations and BTA ligands under ambient conditions.[17] 26 Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectrum of Co-BTA (Figure 3a) 27 displays a single peak around 3300 cm<sup>-1</sup>, which corresponds to 28 N-H stretching vibration of -NH in secondary amines and differs 29 from that of non-coordinated BTA featuring symmetric and 30 antisymmetric N-H stretching (3300-3500 cm<sup>-1</sup>). [18-19] Since Co-31 BTA is amorphous (Figure S12), synchrotron X-ray absorption 32 near-edge structure (XANES) analysis was performed to probe 33 the coordination environment of Co. The line position (absorption 34 edge) of Co-BTA locates between Co foil and Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (Figure 3b), 35 which, together with the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) 36 result (Figure S13), indicates Co(II) oxidation state in Co-BTA. 37 From the extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) 38 spectra (Figure 3c), the main peak at 1.41 Å is attributed to the 39 Co-N scattering path, while the absence of metallic Co-Co 40 scattering (at 2.18 Å) suggests isolated Co atoms in stabilized

To further improve the conductivity, Co-BTA was in situ grown  $_{54}$  on CNTs to form Co-BTA@CNTs by taking advantage of the  $\pi$ - $\pi$ <sub>55</sub> interaction (Figure S19-22) as evidenced by the  $\pi$ - $\pi$ \* satellite 56 peak shift<sup>[21]</sup> from 291.0 to 291.8 eV in the C 1s XPS spectra 57 (Figure S23). From the high-resolution TEM images (Figure 3d 58 and S24), an amorphous layer (thickness of 1-4 nm) of Co-BTA 59 is coated on CNTs. Elemental mapping reveals homogeneous 60 distribution of Co, N, and C in Co-BTA@CNTs (Figure 3e). High-61 angle annular dark-filed scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM) image 62 shows a high density of atomically isolated bright spots (Figure 63 3f), which corresponds to Co(II) as evidenced by Co L-edge 64 electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS, Figure 3f inset). [22] The 65 determined Co content of Co-BTA@CNTs is 5.5 wt% from ICP-66 OES analysis. Furthermore, Co-TABQ and Co-TABQ@CNTs (5.6 67 wt% Co) were prepared for comparison, 68 characterizations are shown in Figure S25-S29. The FTIR 69 spectrum of Co-TABQ (Figure 3a) also presents a characteristic 70 N-H stretching vibration while the peak of C=O bond (1615 cm<sup>-1</sup>) 71 blue shifts as compared with that of TABQ, which is attributed to 72 the coordination effect forming an extended conjugated system. [23] The electrocatalytic ORR activities of TM-BTA were estimated <sub>74</sub> in 0.1 M KOH solution using a rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE). 75 In cyclic voltammograms (Figure S30), the distinguishable 76 cathodic peak at O<sub>2</sub> atmosphere indicates the catalytic capability 77 of TM-BTA + carbon black mixture (TM-BTA/C). From the ORR <sub>78</sub> polarization curves (Figure 4a), Co-BTA/C exhibits an E<sub>1/2</sub> of 0.77 79 V, which is 40 and 90 mV higher than those of Ni-BTA/C and Cu-80 BTA/C, respectively. The electron transfer number calculated 81 from ring and disk currents is 3.86, 3.12 and 3.81 for Co-BTA/C,

1 Ni-BTA/C and Cu-BTA/C, respectively, which coincides with the 2 results from Koutecky-Levich plots (Figure S30 and S31). Co-3 BTA/C favors an apparent guasi-4e<sup>-</sup> ORR pathway with low H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> 4 yield (<5%), in comparison with Ni-BTA/C (47%) and Cu-BTA/C 5 (17%). Thus, the ORR activities of TM-BTA follow an order of Co-6 BTA/C > Ni-BTA/C > Cu-BTA/C, agreeing well with our theoretical  $_{7}$  prediction. Deteriorative shift of  $E_{1/2}$  is observed after s ethylenediaminetetraacetic sodium (EDTA) chelating, proving 9 that the metal centers are actual active sites (Figure S32).

Growing Co-BTA on CNTs further improves the ORR performance of Co-BTA. The electrochemical active surface area 12 (ECSA) of Co-BTA@CNTs is almost 2-fold higher than that of Co-13 BTA/C (Figure S33 and S34). As shown in Figure 4b and Figure 14 S35, Co-BTA@CNTs exhibits remarkable ORR activity with Equipment 14 S35, Co-BTA@CNTs exhibits remarkable ORR activity with Equipment 14 S35, Co-BTA@CNTs exhibits remarkable ORR activity with Equipment 14 S35, Co-BTA@CNTs exhibits remarkable ORR activity with Equipment 14 S35, Co-BTA@CNTs exhibits remarkable ORR activity with Equipment 14 S35, Co-BTA@CNTs exhibits remarkable ORR activity with Equipment 14 S35, Co-BTA@CNTs exhibits remarkable ORR activity with Equipment 14 S35, Co-BTA@CNTs exhibits remarkable ORR activity with Equipment 14 S35, Co-BTA@CNTs exhibits remarkable ORR activity with Equipment 14 S35, Co-BTA@CNTs exhibits remarkable ORR activity with Equipment 14 S35, Co-BTA@CNTs exhibits remarkable ORR activity with Equipment 14 S35, Co-BTA@CNTs exhibits remarkable ORR activity with Equipment 14 S35, Co-BTA@CNTs exhibits remarkable ORR activity with Equipment 14 S35, Co-BTA@CNTs exhibits remarkable ORR activity with Equipment 14 S35, Co-BTA@CNTs exhibits remarkable ORR activity with Equipment 14 S35, Co-BTA@CNTs exhibits remarkable ORR activity with Equipment 14 S35, Co-BTA@CNTs exhibits remarkable ORR activity with Equipment 14 S35, Co-BTA@CNTs exhibits remarkable ORR activity with Equipment 14 S35, Co-BTA@CNTs exhibits remarkable ORR activity with Equipment 14 S35, Co-BTA@CNTs exhibits remarkable ORR activity with Equipment 14 S35, Co-BTA@CNTs exhibits remarkable ORR activity with Equipment 14 S35, Co-BTA@CNTs exhibits remarkable ORR activity with Equipment 14 S35, Co-BTA@CNTs exhibits remarkable ORR activity with Equipment 14 S35, Co-BTA@CNTs exhibits remarkable ORR activity with Equipment 14 S35, Co-BTA@CNTs exhibits remarkable ORR activity with Equipment 14 S35, Co-BTA@CNTs exhibits remarkable ORR activity with Equipment 14 S35, Co-BTA@CNTs exhibits remarkable ORR activity with Equipment 14 S35, Co-BTA@CNTs exhibits remarkable ORR activity with Equipment 14 S35, Co-BTA@CNTs exhibits remarkable ORR activity with Equipment 14 S35, Co-BTA@CNTs exhibits remarkable ORR activity with Equipment 14 S35 15 of 0.95 V,  $E_{1/2}$  of 0.83 V and Tafel slope of 65 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>, 16 comparable to commercial Pt/C (0.99 V, 0.84 V and 59 mV dec 17 1). For Co-BTA@CNTs, the average electron transfer number is 18 3.90, close to that of Pt/C (3.98) (Figure S36 and S37). <sup>19</sup> Additionally, chronoamperometry was recorded at 0.47 V with an 20 electrode rotating rate of 400 round per minute to assess the 21 electrocatalytic durability (Figure 4c). After testing for 10 h, the 22 current retention on Co-BTA@CNTs is 95.6%, significantly higher 23 than that of Pt/C (84.4%). The stability is further affirmed by the 24 negligible structural change of the post-ORR Co-BTA@CNTs, as 25 evidenced from HRTEM and XPS characterizations (Figure S38). 26 In addition, Co-BTA@CNTs exhibits excellent methanol tolerance, 27 while the current density of Pt/C decreases obviously with 28 methanol added (Figure S39).

Substituent modification also works in ORR activity regulation 30 as well as common coordination atom replacement (Figure S40). 31 Compared with Co-BTA@CNTs, Co-TABQ@CNTs manifests 32 higher activity towards electrocatalytic ORR. Excitingly, Co-50 agreeing with DFT computations.

52 tested at a high current density of 40 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> using gas diffusion 53 electrode (GDE, catalyst mass loading about 1 mg cm<sup>-2</sup>) in H-type 54 cells. As depicted in Figure 4d and Figure S43, the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> yield on 55 Co-TABQ@CNTs is much lower than that on Co-BTA@CNTs and <sub>56</sub> Pt/C, attaining a low concentration of 381.6 mg L<sup>-1</sup> after 57 accumulating for 7 h. The rapid rise of peroxide generation on 58 Pt/C after 5 h indicates undesirable activity degradation, which 59 can be ascribed to the apparent agglomeration of platinum 60 nanoparticles after catalytic testing (Figure S44). Thus, Co-61 TABQ@CNTs and Co-BTA@CNTs outperform Pt/C in terms of 62 stability and selectivity during the ORR electrocatalysis at a high 63 current density.

In addition, Co- 74 volcano for TM-BTA. DFT studies unveil that the strong d-π 38 TABQ@CNTs significantly surpasses Pt/C in metal-based 75 conjugation due to orbital hybridization widens the distribution and <sub>39</sub> specific activity (current normalized by metal mass), attaining a  $_{76}$  elevates the energy states of  $d_{xz}/d_{yz}$ , which strengthens the 40 high value of 127 mA mg<sub>metal</sub> 1 at 0.8 V (Figure 4f). The current  $_{77}$  adsorption of rate-determining \*OOH intermediates on TM 41 densities of Co-BTA@CNTs and Co-TABQ@CNTs were also 78 centers. As a result, Co-BTA is predicted to have a lower 42 normalized by specific surface area (Figure S42). Furthermore, 79 theoretical ORR overpotential. Electrochemical results confirm 43 Co-TABQ@CNTs shows considerable stability with a 96.6% 80 superior ORR activity of synthesized Co-BTA to Ni-BTA and Cu-44 current retention after chronoamperometry test (Figure 4c). Note 81 BTA. Besides, the strong d-π conjugation is found to augment the  $_{45}$  that the electrocatalytic activity of Co-TABQ@CNTs is  $_{82}$  effect of substituent groups on  $d_{xz}/d_{yz}$  and  $d_{z^2}$  orbitals of TM 46 comparable to that of reported state-of-the-art ORR catalysts 83 centers. Both experimental and theoretical studies indicate that 47 based on non-noble TM complexes (Table S2). These results 84 substituting electron-donating group in TM-BTA enhances ORR 48 clearly indicate that introducing electron-donating group in ligand 85 electrocatalysis. Remarkably, Co-TABQ@CNTs exhibits an E<sub>1/2</sub> 49 of Co-BTA contributes to boost the ORR electrocatalysis, again 86 of 0.85 V, outperforming the benchmark Pt/C. This work provides 87 mechanistic insight of the d-π conjugation effect on ORR, and The Co-BTA@CNTs and Co-TABQ@CNTs catalysts were also selectional searching TM complexes as high-performance 89 electrocatalysts.

### Entry for the Table of Contents

A two-step strategy was proposed to optimize the ORR activity of TM-BTA (TM = Mn/Fe/Co/Ni/Cu, BTA = 1,2,4,5-benzenetetramine) analogs by screening preliminarily TM centers and subsequently substituent groups. Strong  $d\text{-}\pi$  conjugation in TM-BTA is found to elevate the  $d_{xz}/d_{yz}$ , orbitals, which enhances the activity of TM centers, and also enlarges the impact of ligand functional groups on d orbitals of TM centers.

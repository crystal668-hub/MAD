Abstract: Fe-Co-N-C electrocatalysts have proven superior to their counterparts (e.g. Fe-N-C or Co-N-C) for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Herein, we report on a unique strategy to make Fe-Co-N-C-x (x refers to the pyrolysis temperature) electrocatalysts which involves anion-exchange of [Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>3-</sup> into a cationic Co(II)based metal-organic framework precursor prior to heat treatment. Fe-Co-N-C-900 exhibits the optimal ORR catalytic performance in alkaline electrolyte with the comparable onset potential ( $E_{onset}$ : 0.97 V) and the half-wave potential ( $E_{1/2}$ : 0.86 V) to the commercial Pt/C ( $E_{onset}$ = 1.02 V;  $E_{1/2}$  = 0.88 V), which also far outperforms the corresponding Co-N-C-900 ( $E_{onset}$  = 0.92 V;  $E_{1/2}$  = 0.84 V) derived from the same MOF precursor without anion-exchange modification. This is the first example of Fe-Co-N-C electrocatalysts fabricated from a cationic Co(II)-based MOF precursor that dopes the Fe element via anionexchange, and our current work provides a new entrance towards MOF-derived transition-metal (e.g. Fe or Co) and nitrogen-codoped carbon electrocatalysts with excellent ORR activity.

#### Introduction

The cathodic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is a pivotal process in the energy-conversion devices such as fuel cells and metal-air batteries, which heavily relies on platinum (Pt)-based catalysts (e.g. Pt/C) due to its sluggish kinetics. However, Pt-based catalysts suffer from several intrinsic drawbacks including prohibitive-cost, limited reserve as well as poor stability, posing a daunting barrier to wide implementation of these promising devices. To overcome this bottleneck, there is a fast-growing interest in exploring nonplatinum-metal-based electrocatalysts (NPMCs) as the expensive Pt/C alternatives. Among various types of NPMCs, Fe or Co-N-C catalysts with the proposed Fe-Nx or

 $\text{Co-N}_x$  active sites have been recognized as one of the most promising candidates. [4] Particularly, Fe-Co-N-C electrocatalysts with Fe, Co-dual metal dopants embedded into the carbon matrix have been reported to even outperform the Fe-N-C or Co-N-C counterpart towards ORR, which have been attributed to the subtle synergistic actions between the Fe and Co atoms. [5]

Generally, Fe or Co-N-C electrocatalysts are prepared by annealing treatment of mixed precursors containing the essential elements (e.g. Fe, Co, N and C) at high temperatures. In this context, metal-organic-frameworks (MOFs), especially zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs), have stood out as a unique class of precursors or self-sacrificed templates because of their inherent advantages.[6] First, crystalline MOFs contain threedimension ordered C, N and metal elements simultaneously, which make a large contribution to homogenous element distribution in the final ORR catalyst. Second, high surface area, adjustable micropore and well-defined morphology of MOFs can be inherited into the catalyst under the proper preparation conditions. Finally, highly tunable structures of MOFs with easy modification render it facile to engineer the Fe/Co-N-C electrocatalyst. For instance. Fe-N-C catalysts derived from ZIF-8 (based on Zn<sup>2+</sup> and 2-methylimidazole) can be achieved by physically mixing (e.g. ball milling),[7] chemical substitution (e.g. Fe/Zn-bimetallic ZIF).[8] surface absorption as well as quest encapsulation (e.g. Fe(acac)<sub>3</sub>, FePc, Fe(CO)<sub>5</sub>).<sup>[9]</sup> Despite of tremendous efforts in MOF-derived Fe or Co-N-C catalysts, the majority are found to be narrowly confined to ZIFs (e.g. ZIF-8), and less attention has been paid to other types of MOFs.[10] Nonetheless, the total MOFs studied including ZIFs amount only a small fraction of the large MOF family (>20000). Therefore, vast opportunities can be envisioned in this arena given that the huge varieties of MOFs in terms of compositions, structures and morphologies. For example, charged MOFs with the cationic or anionic framework accommodate exchangeable ions within their channels or cavities, which allow introduction of secondary precursors through ion exchange.[11] As far as we know, no attempt has been made to fabricate Fe/Co-N-C catalysts from these charged MOFs.

In this work, we have synthesized a cationic MOF of 1,  $[Co(TTPBA-4)](CIO_4)_2.nS$  (S = solvent, TTPBA-4 = N, N, N', N'-tetrakis(4-phenyl-1,2,4-triazole)-p-phenylenediamine), with the charge-balanced  $CIO_4$  anions occluded into its one-dimensional (1D) channels (Scheme 1). Through anion-exchange with  $CIO_4$  anions, external  $[Fe(CN)_6]^{3-}$  anions from potassium ferricyanide  $(K_3[Fe(CN)_6])$  were introduced into the channels of 1, giving rise to a Fe/Co-coexisting MOF of 2. Pyrolysis of 1 and 2 under the same condition (900°C, 2hrs,  $N_2$  atmosphere) resulted in Co-N-C-900 and Fe-Co-N-C-900 electrocatalysts, respectively.

#### **FULL PAPER**

Compared to Co-N-C-900 ( $E_{\rm onset}$  = 0.92 V;  $E_{1/2}$  = 0.84 V), Fe-Co-N-C-900 exhibits a significant enhancement in ORR catalytic activity, with the onset potential ( $E_{\rm onset}$ ) of 0.97 V (vs. RHE) and the half-wave potential ( $E_{1/2}$ ) of 0.86 V (vs. RHE) comparable to the commercial Pt/C catalyst ( $E_{\rm onset}$  = 1.02 V;  $E_{1/2}$  = 0.88 V). To the best of our knowledge, this is a rare example of Fe-Co-N-C catalysts derived from a cationic Co(II)-based MOF that incorporates secondary Fe-containing precursor by means of anion-exchange.

#### **Results and Discussion**

#### Preparation and characterization of 1 and 2

Solvothermal reaction of TTPBA-4 Co(ClO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>·6H<sub>2</sub>O resulted in tiny yellow crystals of 1,  $[Co(TTPBA-4)](CIO_4)_2.xS$  (S = solvent). The fumaric acid likely acts as a reaction modulator that is indispensable for this reaction, otherwise a low yield of crystals was resulted. FT-IR spectra of 1 exhibits an apparent CIO<sub>4</sub>- stretching band at c.a.1100 cm<sup>-1</sup> despite that the CIO<sub>4</sub> anions are too disordered to be structurally resolved (Figure S1). The PXRD pattern of the as-synthesized samples of 1 is in good accordance with the simulated one from the single-crystal structure data, indicating the phase purity (Figure S2). Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis reveals that 1 possesses a three-dimensional (3D) non-interpenetrating network, wherein phenyl rings of TTPBA-4 ligand are highly disordered probably because of less rotation barrier with the relatively flexible backbone. Each Co atom in 1 adopts a perfect octahedral geometry completed by six N atoms (Co-N: 2.135 Å) (Figure 1a), and each TTPBA-4 ligand links six Co atoms with four triazole units (two in a 1,2-bridging mode and two in a unidentate mode) (Figure 1b). Three Co atoms are united together into a linear centrosymmetric trinuclear Co cluster (Co-Co: 3.8591(8) Å) by twelve triazole groups, that is, adjacent Co atoms are triply bridged by three triazole groups, and two terminal Co atoms are further bound by three unidentate triazole groups (Figure 1c).

With the trinuclear Co cluster as a 12-connecting node and the **TTPBA-4** ligand as a four-connecting linker, a 3-D non-interpenetrating coordination network is built with one-dimensional (1D) channels (Figure 1d). Considering the charge neutrality of **TTPBA-4** ligand, the entire framework of 1 should be cationic in nature with charge-balanced CIO<sub>4</sub>-anions residing within the 1D channels.

1 can be used as a single precursor towards Co-N-C electrocatalyst since it simultaneously contains C, N and Co atoms arrayed orderly in the entire crystal structure. On the other hand, cationic nature of 1 allows to incorporate secondary precursors by anion-exchange. In this case, we introduce [Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>3</sup>- anions (from K<sub>3</sub>[Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub>]) into 1 by exchanging with the CIO<sub>4</sub> anions, leading to a Fe/Co-coexisting MOF that can be employed to prepare Fe-Co-N-C catalysts. A plenty of investigations have demonstrated that Fe-Co-N-C catalysts can deliver superior catalytic activity for ORR over the single-metal-doped Fe-N-C and Co-N-C counterpart owing to the potential synergism between the doped Fe and Co species. Meanwhile, examples of Fe-Co-N-C catalysts directly derived from MOFs are still quite limited. [5] Hence, the current case constitutes a rare example of Fe-Co-N-C electrocatalysts evolved from a cationic Co(II)-based MOF modified by anion-exchange with K<sub>3</sub>[Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub>]. The anion exchange experiment was carried out by immersing 1 into the solution of  $K_3[Fe(CN)_6]$  (1x10<sup>-4</sup> mol L<sup>-1</sup>) for 30 mins. The anion-exchange process between ClO<sub>4</sub>- and [Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>3</sup>- can be visualized by the colour change of K<sub>3</sub>Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub> aqueous solution (pale green) that gradually fades with the time (Figure 2a). The gradual decolorization of K<sub>3</sub>[Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub>] aqueous solution also synchronizes well with the UV-Vis absorption spectra, showing a steady decline of the absorptions at 302 nm and 419 nm of [Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>3-</sup> anions (Figure 2b). The anionexchanged sample of [Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>3</sup>-@1 (herein referred as 2) displays a visible stretching band of CN- at 2058 cm-1 that is absent in 1 (Figure 2c), and PXRD measurement indicates that 2 well retains the framework integrity of 1 after ion-exchange

(Figure 2d). All above results unambiguously verify that  $[Fe(CN)_6]^{3-}$  anions have been successfully exchanged into the channels of 1.

## Electrochemical measurements of Co-N-C-900 and Fe-Co-N-C-900

Direct carbonization of 1 and 2 at different temperatures a series of Co-N-C-x and Fe-Co-N-x electrocatalysts (x represents pyrolysis temperature). The ORR catalytic activities of these electrocatalysts were evaluated in O<sub>2</sub>-saturated 0.1 M KOH solution using a rotating-disk electrode (RDE) method. The polarization curves of Co-N-C-x and Fe-Co-N-C-x samples (x = 800, 900 and 1000) indicate that Co-N-C-900 and Fe-Co-N-C-900 show the best ORR performance (Figure S3). Besides, the influence of concentration of K<sub>3</sub>[Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub>] solution on the ORR performance of the corresponding Fe-Co-N-C catalysts was also investigated, indicating that the best result was obtained with K<sub>3</sub>[Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub>] solution of 1x10<sup>-4</sup> mol L<sup>-1</sup> (Figure S4). Co-N-C-900 demonstrates the onset potential (E<sub>onset</sub>) of 0.92 V (vs. RHE) and the half-wave potential ( $E_{1/2}$ ) of 0.84 V (vs. RHE), which is inferior to the benchmark Pt/C catalyst ( $E_{onset} = 1.02V$ , and  $E_{1/2}$  = 0.88V). The saturated current density ( $J_L$ , 2.72 mA cm<sup>-1</sup> 2) of Co-N-C-900 is also significantly low, only about half of the Pt/C catalyst (5.0 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>) (Figure 3a). The electron transfer number (n) with Co-N-C-900 was calculated based the Koutecky-Levich (K-L) equation from the corresponding K-L plots ( $J^{-1}$ , vs.  $\omega^{-1/2}$ ) at various potentials (Figure S5). As shown in Figure 3b, the K-L plots of Co-N-C-900 at various potentials display good linearity and parallelism, suggesting first-order reaction kinetics against the concentration of dissolved O<sub>2</sub>, and the slopes keep approximately constant in the potential range of 0.4-0.7V. indicating the electron transfer number (n) is almost the same. The n value with Co-N-C-900 is about 2.2. indicative of a dominant 2 e<sup>-</sup> reduction pathway (Figure 3c). In stark contrast. Fe-Co-N-C-900 derived from 2 exhibits a significant enhancement in ORR catalytic activities with E<sub>onset</sub> (0.97V),

 $E_{1/2}$  (0.86V) and  $J_L$  (4.6 mA.cm<sup>-2</sup>) comparable to the reference 20% Pt/C (Figure 3a, Table S2). The calculated volumetric ORR activity and TOF value of Fe-Co-N-C-900 are 0.32A/cm<sup>3</sup> and 0.72e<sup>-1</sup>/(site s) respectively (Table S3). The n value with Fe-Co-N-C-900 also drastically increases to 3.9 (Figure 3d and Figure 3e), indicating a favourable 4 e<sup>-1</sup> oxygen reduction mechanism. The Tafel slope of Fe-Co-N-C-900 (62.5 mV dec-1) is also smaller than Co-N-C-900 (78.1 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>) and the 20% Pt/C (85.3 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>) (Figure 3f), further confirming its outstanding ORR activity. In addition, Fe-Co-N-C-900 exhibits excellent methanol tolerance as indicated by its intact CV curve upon addition of methanol (Figure S6). Accelerated duration test (ADT) further indicates that Fe-Co-N-C-900 possesses an outstanding durability with a minor loss of 9 mV in  $E_{1/2}$  after 10 000 cycles ((Figure S7).

#### Comparison of Co-N-C-900 and Fe-Co-N-C-900

To better understand the superb ORR performance of Fe-Co-N-C-900, both Fe-Co-N-C-900 and Co-N-C-900 were further characterized by means of SEM, TEM, PXRD, Raman, N<sub>2</sub>-sorption as well as XPS techniques. SEM images reveal a large difference in morphology between Co-N-C-900 and Fe-Co-N-C-900. As depicted in Figure 4a and 4e, Co-N-C-900 exhibits a cheese-like morphology that might be caused by the corrosive effect of CIO<sub>4</sub>- at high temperature (Figure S8), whereas Fe-Co-N-C-900 is composed of denselypacked grains. TEM images illustrate that both Co-N-C-900 (Figure 4b) and Fe-Co-N-C-900 (Figure 4f) are consisted of carbon matrix decorated by dark spots with irregular sizes. TEM pictures of high magnification (Figure 4c and 4g) further reveal that the carbon matrix of Co-N-C-900 has a relatively smooth surface in sharp contrast with the rough foam-like texture in Fe-Co-N-C-900. These dark spots are attributed to the metallic Co nanoparticles (NPs), which are testified by PXRD peaks at about 44° and 51° (a = 3.545 Å, JCPDS No. 15-0806) (Figure 4i). The Co nanoparticle size (30-75 nm range) in Fe-Co-N-C-900 is obviously larger than Co-N-C-900 (25-55 nm range), indicating more severe Co atom agglomeration. The increasing agglomeration of Co atoms in Fe-Co-N-C-900 might be attributed to the fact that the doped

Fe atoms with strong coordinating ability would occupy the N-C<sub>x</sub> sites which initially stablize the Co atoms in Co-N-C-900, thus expelling the Co atoms out of the carbon matrix to merge into larger Co NPs. Notably, Co nanoparticles (lattice spacing of 0.202 nm corresponding to the (110) plane of face-centered cubic metallic Co) in Fe-Co-N-C-900 are wrapped by graphitic carbon layers (lattice spacing of 0.34 nm corresponding to the (002) graphitic carbon plane) (Figure 4h), instead of amorphous carbon in Co-N-C-900 (Figure 4d). The formation of graphitic-carbon-encapsulated Co NPs in Fe-Co-N-C-900 might proceed in the following route. The incorporated [Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>3-</sup> anions decomposed in the process of high-temperature pyrolysis, releasing carboneous and nitrogenous species and the reduced Fe atoms. These emitted C,N-containing ingredients further deposited on the surface of Co NPs and were catalyzed by the Fe atoms to form graphitic carbon shell. [12] Graphiticlayer-encapsulated Co NPs have been considered as one type of active sites towards ORR, which can donate electrons to the N-doped carbon shell to improve the absorption of oxygen-related species (O2, HO-, HOO-) to boost the ORR activity.[13] Indeed, a remarkably deteriorated ORR performance was observed with the acid-treated Fe-Co-N-C-900 samples (Figure S9), demonstrating the critical role of these graphitic-carbon-encapsulated Co NPs in ORR. Raman spectra of Co-N-C-900 and Fe-Co-N-C-900 show two characteristic bands, viz. the D band at 1346 cm-1 (corresponding to the defected carbon) and the G band at 1586 cm<sup>-1</sup> (corresponding to the graphitic carbon) (Figure 4j). The larger peak intensity ratio of D and G bands  $(I_D/I_G)$  of Fe-Co-N-C-900 (0.928) than Co-N-C-900 (0.752) infers the presence of more structure defects which are generally associated with more active sites.[14] N<sub>2</sub> adsorptiondesorption isotherms uncovered the surface area and pore texture of Fe-Co-N-C-900 and Co-N-C-900 (Figure 4k). Both Co-N-C-900 and Fe-Co-N-C-900 feature a pronounced hysteresis loop, indicative of the mesoporous structure. The specific surface area of Fe-Co-N-C-900 estimated by the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method is around 339 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>, which is larger than that of the Co-N-C-900 (231 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>). The pore size distribution (PSD) analysis manifests that Fe-Co-N-C-900 comprises abundant mesopores with the size narrowly centered at around 8 nm compared to Co-N-C-900 (Figure S10). Compared to Co-N-C-900, the change in surface area and pore texture of Fe-Co-N-C is assumed to be partly resulted by decompositon of anion-exchanged [Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>3</sup>- anions during the pyrolyisis, which would release gases species (e.g HCN) to help tune the microstructure. ORR is a heterogeneous process that proceeds at tri-phase boundary (solid catalyst, oxygen and electrolyte). Therefore, the high surface area of Fe-Co-N-C-900 can expose more active sites to reactants, significantly improving ORR halfwave polarization potential and limiting current.[15] Meanwhile, the predominant uniform mesopores of Fe-Co-N-C-900 can lower the mass transfer resistance to allow ORR-relevant species more easily to access the active sites during the ORR.<sup>[16]</sup>

spectra were used to examine the elemental composition and chemical bonding of Co-N-C-900 and Fe-Co-N-C-900. The XPS survey spectra of Co-N-C-900 show the presence of C, N, O and Co species. By comparison, an extra Fe species is detected in Fe-Co-N-C-900 along with C, N, O and Co species (Figure S11), confirming the successful Fe-doping into carbon. Inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometer (ICP-AES) measurement indicates that the actual Fe and Co contents in Fe-Co-N-C-900 are 0.67 wt% and 15.99 wt%, respectively. The high-resolution Co 2p spectra of Co-N-C-900 and Fe-Co-N-C-900 both reveal the existence of three forms of Co species, viz. metallic Co (780.5 eV), Co-N<sub>x</sub> (779.8 eV) and Co<sub>x</sub>O<sub>y</sub>/CoC<sub>x</sub>N<sub>y</sub> (778.6 ev) (Figure 5a). The deconvoluted Fe 2p spectra of Fe-Co-N-C-900 indicate that the Fe atoms exist in Fe<sup>0</sup> and  $Fe^{2+}/Fe^{3+}$  oxidation state ( $Fe^0$ : 707.08 ev,  $Fe^{2+}(2p_{1/2})$ : 724.8 ev,  $Fe^{3+}(2p_{1/2})$ : 727.7 ev,  $Fe^{2+}(2p_{3/2})$ : 711.3 eV,  $Fe^{3+}(2p_{3/2})$ : 714.6 eV) (Figure 5b), which could coordinate to pyridinic N to form highly active Fe-N<sub>x</sub> species.<sup>[17]</sup> The high-resolution N1s spectrum of Co-N-C-900 can be deconvoluted into five peaks assigned to pyridinic N (398.4 eV), Co-N<sub>x</sub> (399.2 eV), pyrrolic N (400.1 eV), graphitic N (401.2 eV), and oxidized N (404.0 eV) (Figure 5c). By contrast, a new type of Fe-N<sub>x</sub> (399.6 eV) is further resolved from the high-resolution N1s spectrum of Fe-Co-N-C-900 (Figure 5c). It has been widely accepted that the configuration of the doped N atom plays a critical role in controlling the ORR activity by changing the electronic and geometric structure of carbon materials. Among various types of N atoms, pyridinic N atom is highly valued either directly acting as a catalytic center[18] or generating Fe-N<sub>x</sub> or Co-N<sub>x</sub> active sites, [19] whilst graphitic N atom is favourable for a four-electron ORR process. A

#### **FULL PAPER**

comparison between Co-N-C-900 and Fe-Co-N-C-900 discloses that Fe-Co-N-C-900 possesses highly active Fe-N<sub>x</sub> species and ample graphitic N atoms (Figure 5d), which could help to enhance the ORR activity and  $4e^-$  selectivity. [20]

**Figure 5.** (a) High resolution XPS spectra at Co 2p region of Co-N-C-900 and Fe-Co-N-C-900; (b) High resolution XPS spectra at Fe 2p region of Fe-Co-N-C-900; (c) High resolution XPS spectra at N 1s region of Co-N-C-900 and Fe-Co-N-C-900; (d) Content of different N species in Co-N-C-900 and Fe-Co-N-C-900.

Taken together, there exist multiple active sites in Fe-Co-N-C-900 including N-C<sub>x</sub> (pyridine-N, graphitic-N atoms), Fe-N<sub>x</sub>, Co-N<sub>x</sub> as well as graphitic-carbon-encapsulated Co NPs. Meanwhile, Fe-Co-N-C-900 exhibits optimal microstructure against Co-N-C-900 such as large surface area and abundant uniform mesopores, which are favourable for ORR process. Both ideal active sites and microstructures are indispensable for attaining high ORR performance. Accordingly, the remarkable enhancement in ORR activity of Fe-Co-N-C-900 might be the combined result of multiple active sites (including their synergistic interactions) and favourable microstructure. In the case of Fe-Co-N-C-900, the anion-exchanged [Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>3-</sup> anions in Fe-Co-N-C-900, even in a very low fraction, play several key roles in enhancing the ORR activities. First, the decomposition of [Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>3-</sup> anions during the pyrolysis might help form the graphitic-carbonencapsulated Co NPs and tune the microstructure. Second. the [Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>3-</sup> anions act as a Fe source to generate highly active  $Fe-N_x$  sites, significantly boosting the ORR performance. At last, the newly generated Fe-Nx active species may have potential synergism with other active species (e.g. Co-N<sub>x</sub>), which further improve the ORR activity of Fe-Co-N-C-900.[21]

#### Conclusions

We have prepared an efficient Fe-Co-N-C electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction, which is derived from a cationic Co(II)-based metal-organic framework modified by anion-

exchange with  $[Fe(CN)_6]^3$ . Dramatic enhancement in ORR performance of Fe-Co-N-C electrocatalyst was observed compared to the corresponding Co-N-C counterpart, which has been attributed to the following factors (i) favourable microstructure (e.g. high surface area, dominant mesopores); (ii) multiple active sites (graphitic N atoms, highly active Fe-N<sub>x</sub> species, graphitic-carbon-layer-wrapped Co nanoparticles and the potential synergistic interaction between Fe-N<sub>x</sub> and Co-N<sub>x</sub>). Our current work provides an interesting method to fabricate MOF-derived Fe-Co-N-C electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction, highlighting the charged MOFs as a unique class of precursors for excellent ORR catalyst design.

Rigaku Corporation with Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 1.54056 Å). The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area and pore distribution were measured by nitrogen adsorption-desorption on a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 surface area and porosity analyzer. Raman spectra were recorded on a Thermo DXR 532 Raman spectrometer (USA) with a laser excitation wavelength of 532 nm.

#### Synthesis of [Co(TTPBA-4)](ClO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>.nS (1)

A mixture of  $Co(CIO_4)_2.6H_2O$  (0.08mmol, 0.0293g), **TTPBA-4** (0.02mmol, 0.0134g), and fumaric acid (0.02mmol, 0.0023g) was dissolved in a mixed solvent (9mL, DMF/MeOH / $H_2O$  = 1:1:1) at room temperature, and then transferred into a Teflon-lined autoclave, sealed and heated at 100°C for 3 days. The reactor was slowly cooled to room temperature at a rate of 5°C/h. The resultant yellow rice grainy transparent crystals were filtrated and dried in the air. IR (KBr, cm<sup>-1</sup>): 3423(m), 3111(w), 2971(w), 1597(m), 1516(vs), 1315(m), 1271(m), 1095(s), 834(w), 628(w), 545(w).

#### Preparation of Co-N-C and Fe-Co-N-C electrocatalysts

Crystals of 1 (40 mg) were soaked into 40 mL of potassium ferricyanide solution ( $K_3[Fe(CN)_6]$ ,  $1x10^{-4}$  mol  $L^{-1}$ ) for 0.5 hour to afford crystals of 2, which were filtered, washed with the distilled water and dried in the air. The Co-N-C and Fe-N-C electrocatalysts were prepared by the temperature-programmed pyrolysis of 1 and 2, respectively. Typically, 120 mg of 1 or 2 was heated to the target temperature (800°C, 900°C or 1000°C) at a heating rate of 5°C min-1. After reaching the target temperature, it was kept constant for 2 hours and then cooled to the room temperature naturally. The

resultant samples were designated as Co-N-C-x and Fe-Co-N-C-x (x is the carbonization temperature).

#### X-ray crystallography

The crystallographic data collection of 1 was carried out on a Bruker D8 Venture diffractometer with graphite-monochromated Mo Ka radiation ( $\lambda$  = 0.71073 Å) at 296(2) K using  $\omega$ -scan technique. The diffraction data was integrated by using the SAINT program, [23] which was also used for the intensity corrections for the Lorentz and polarization effects. Semi-empirical absorption correction was applied using the SADABS program.[24] The structure was solved by direct methods and all the non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically on F2 by the full-matrix least-squares technique using the SHELXL-2014 crystallographic software package. [25] All the hydrogen atoms were generated geometrically and refined isotropically using the riding model. Due to the benzene ring disorder, we used some instructions in the structural refinement process, such as isor, part, exyz, eadp etc. The solvent molecules and counter anions are highly disordered and cannot be processed which have been treated by *PLATON* squeeze program.<sup>[26]</sup> The crystallographic data of 1 are listed Table S1. Crystallographic data in CIF format were deposited with the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre as CCDC 1841818 for 1.

#### **Electrochemical measurements**

Electrochemical measurements were performed using a CHI 604E electrochemical workstation in a standard three-electrode system with a platinum wire as the counter electrode, Ag/AgCl electrode as the reference electrode and a rotating disk electrode (RDE, 3mm in diameter) coated with the catalyst as the working electrode. The working electrode was prepared as follows: 6 mg of catalyst was dispersed ultrasonically in 1 mL of Nafion/ethanol (0.25% Nafion). 9  $\mu$ L of the dispersion was transferred onto the glassy carbon (GC) disk using a pipette, and then dried in the air for the preparation of the catalyst layer. Before each measurement, the solution was purged with high purity  $N_2$  and/or  $O_2$  gas for at least 30 minutes to ensure the cas saturation

Koutecky–Levich plots (J-¹ vs.  $\omega^{-1/2}$ ) were analyzed at 0.4, 0.5, 0.55, 0.6, 0.65, and 0.7 V in 0.1 M KOH at varying rotating speeds. We use the Koutecky–Levich equation to calculate the electron transfer number (n).<sup>20</sup>

$$\frac{1}{J} = \frac{1}{J_L} + \frac{1}{J_K} = \frac{1}{B\omega^{1/2}} + \frac{1}{J_K}$$

B=0.62nFC

where J is the measured current density,  $J_K$  and  $J_L$  indicate the kinetic- and diffusion limiting current densities respectively,  $\omega$  is the angular velocity, n the electron transfer number, F the Faraday constant,  $C_0$  the bulk concentration of  $O_2$ ,  $\nu$  the kinematic viscosity of the electrolyte, and k the electron-transfer rate constant.

To compare catalyst activities, [27] volumetric ORR activity (i.e., current per volume of catalyst layer (A/cm³)) has been used to analyze non-noble metal catalysts in which volumetric activity relies on TOF and volumetric active site densities. Turnover frequency is the intrinsic activity toward ORR and may depend on the different active site structures. Active site density can be divided into two parameters: specific active site, meaning how many active sites are in a unit of surface area; and volumetric surface area, meaning how much surface area is in a unit of volume. The most rigorous comparison between catalysts can be made if one can quantify two factors for each catalyst: (1) the turnover frequency (TOF), or electrons transferred per active site per second at a given potential and conditions.

and (2) the volumetric site density (SD), in active sites per cm³ of supported catalyst. For a catalyst layer thickness  $\tau$  (cm), the current density J (A/cm²) equals  $(1.6\times10^{-19})\times TOF\times S.D\times \tau$ , where the numeric factor is the charge on the electron in coulombs. Another important factor is the utilization of active sites, which is closely related to the catalyst layer or the membrane electrode assembly (MEA) (Figure S12).

The turnover frequency (TOF) at 0.75V is estimated on the basis of the equation:

Turnover frequency (TOF) (s<sup>-1</sup>)=
$$\frac{J \text{ A}}{4 \text{ n F}}$$

With J as the current density for Fe-Co-N-C-900 (A cm<sup>-2</sup>) = 0.0003158 at  $\eta$  = 750 mV, n is the number of moles of the active sites, A is the geometrical surface area of the electrode (0.07065 cm<sup>-2</sup>), F is the faraday constant (96485.3 s A mol<sup>-1</sup>).

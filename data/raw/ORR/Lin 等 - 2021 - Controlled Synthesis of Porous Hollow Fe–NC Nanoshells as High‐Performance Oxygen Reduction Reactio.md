# Controlled Synthesis of Porous Hollow Fe-N/C Nanoshells as High-Performance Oxygen Reduction Reaction Electrocatalysts for Zn-Air Battery

Hua Lin, Jiande Chen, Yijin Wu, Yiyang Hu, Yuyang Li, Jun-Tao Li, and Yao Zhou\*

The development of high-performance non-noble oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysts is of significant importance for fuel cells and zinc-air batteries. Herein, a dual-template-assisted polymerization process is designed using both silica submicrospheres and ultrafine nanoparticles as hard templates, generating permeable hollow benzoxazine resin nanoshells with well-controlled morphology and size; such resin nanoshells impregnated with urea and iron precursor salt are then calcined under different atmospheres and temperatures to produce a series of porous hollow Fe-N/C thin nanoshells with differentiated pore structures and various N compositions. The effects of the calcination atmosphere and temperature on the structure and composition of the Fe-N/C materials are also evaluated. Owing to its compositional and structural merits, the optimal porous Fe-N/C nanoshell with a specific surface area as high as 998.0 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup> exhibits a half-wave potential  $E_{1/2}$  of 0.919 V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)) in 0.1 M KOH, 37 mV more positive than that of the commercial Pt/C; when used as a cathode in a Zn-air battery, it displays a power density and specific energy density of 93.5 mW cm<sup>-2</sup> and 779.7 mAh g<sub>Zn</sub><sup>-1</sup>, respectively. This work provides a straightforward method for the size- and shape-controllable synthesis of Fe-N-C-based ORR electrocatalysts.

#### 1. Introduction

The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) plays a profound role in determining the performance of the cathode of metal–air batteries and fuel cells. Owing to its inherently sluggish kinetics, high-performance ORR catalysts which favor the scissoring of O—O bond and formation of O—H bond are a requisite. In this regard, Pt has been explored as the most efficient ORR electrocatalysts. [1-4] Nevertheless, due to its expensiveness, the usage of Pt catalysts

represents one of the major sources of cost in those energy conversion devices. For instance, in a typical proton exchange membrane fuel cell, the ORR cathode consumes a majority of the total Pt; the cost of Pt is expected to further increase with the large-scale commercialization of the fuel cells considering its global scarcity.<sup>[5–7]</sup> Thus, the development of alternative ORR electrocatalysts with minimized utilization of Pt has been widely pursued over the past few decades.

Toward the pursuit of non-Pt ORR electrocatalysts, the metal–nitrogen–carbon (M–N–C) electrocatalysts (M = Fe, Co, Ni, Mn, etc.) with atomically dispersed MN<sub>x</sub> active sites in the carbonaceous framework represent a promising candidate. Particularly, some Fe–N–C catalysts are found comparable with the Pt-based ones when applied in alkaline fuel cells or Zn–air batteries. Such M–N–C ORR electrocatalysts are often obtained through pyrolysis of a metal-organic precursor. Policy In such a high-temperature process, there exist complicate physical and chemical processes

which determine the structural and compositional evolution of the precursors. After pyrolysis, a part of the metal cations (e.g., Fe<sup>2+</sup>) in the precursor would be reduced by the as-formed carbon, eventually forming relevant metal nanoparticles or alloys, [11] while some would coordinate with N species doped in the carbonaceous framework, forming FeN<sub>x</sub> sites with various coordination numbers. [12] For the N dopants, various N species have been involved, including pyridinic N, pyrrolic N, graphitic N, and oxidized N. For instance, Vito et al. found that pyridinic N and N–Fe species which were better exposed on the surface of the X-ray-beam-etched carbon material played a more important role in the ORR; [13] as a comparison, Boukhvalov et al. modeled the structure of the graphitic nitrogen-doped graphene, and in their work the graphene doped with relatively low dosage of graphitic nitrogen (about 4 at%) exhibited lower reaction energy than the Pt surface. [14]

Meanwhile, for an efficient ORR process, the pore structure in the catalyst layer which favors fast transportation of  $O_2$ ,  $H^+$ , and water is also highly important. Hierarchically porous M–N–C structure are generally preferred which, on the one hand, could provide large specific surface area and, on the other hand, supports fast mass diffusion. To this end, the morphology or pore structure of the metal-organic precursor is of equal importance as their composition, as the eventual Fe–N–C after pyrolysis tends

to inherit the structural features of the precursors. Metal–organic frameworks with high crystallinity and abundant micropores, e.g., ZIFs, are the most widely explored metal-organic precursors toward the pursuit of high-performance M–N–C electrocatalysts. As a matter of fact, pore structures with controllable sizes could also be created using soft or hard templates. Especially, hollow carbon nanoshells with a major cavity could be achieved straightforwardly using silica nanoparticles as a template. [16,17] These successful experiences could be used in designing pore structure in metal-organic precursors for M–N–C ORR catalysts.

In this work, as shown in **Scheme 1**, a series of highly porous Fe-N/C hollow nanospheres were designed using mesoporous hollow benzoxazine resin (BR) nanosphere impregnated with iron (II) and urea as the metal-organic precursors; in our synthesis, the silica nanoparticles with different sizes serve as dual templates to induce the major cavity and also to form the mesopores in the BR nanoshell; the affluent amino and oxhydryl in the BR nanoshell ensure strong chemical adsorption of iron (II) species; N-doping was also introduced to improve the performance of the resulting catalysts. [18,19] The optimal Fe-N/C possesses a specific surface area of 998.0 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup> and yields a half-wave potential  $E_{1/2}$  of 0.919 V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), similarly thereafter) in 0.1 m KOH solution for ORR, 37 mV positive than that of the commercial Pt/C catalysts (0.882 V); when used as cathode in a zinc-air battery, the maximal power density could reach 93.5 mW cm<sup>-2</sup>, in comparison with a value of 76.8 mW cm<sup>-2</sup> yielded by Pt/C catalyst under the same conditions.

#### 2. Results and Discussion

# 2.1. Controlled Synthesis of the Porous Fe-N/C Hollow Nanospheres with Dual-SiO<sub>2</sub>-Templates

As shown in Scheme 1, the polymerization of BR was conducted with SiO<sub>2</sub> submicrospheres and nanospheres as dual templates.

Specifically, to induce the hollow cavity, SiO<sub>2</sub> submicrospheres (Figure S1a,b, Supporting Information) were used as the hard template for on-site polymerization of BR; meanwhile, to induce permeability in the BR nanoshell, during the formation of the BR coating layer, to introduce mesopores, tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) was added additionally which would undergo hydrolysis under the presence of ethylenediamine and precipitate as small SiO<sub>2</sub> nanospheres simultaneously in the as-formed BR layer; such SiO<sub>2</sub> nanospheres would serve as the templates for generation of mesopores in the resulting carbonaceous nanoshell. The as-synthesized BR@SiO<sub>2</sub> composite is shown in Figure 1c, which clearly displays a core—shell nanosphere configuration; after the removal of the SiO<sub>2</sub> templates through acid-etching, mesoporous hollow BR nanospheres with high structural integrity are obtained (Figure 1a,b).

Such BR nanoshells impregnated with urea and FeCl<sub>2</sub> were used as the template and precursor to generate a series of porous hollow Fe–N/C nanoshells with similar morphology (shown in latter section); nevertheless, such Fe–N/C samples are different in their structural feature (e.g., specific surface area, pore size) and compositions of nitrogen species, as they are derived from calcination either in different atmospheres (e.g., Fe–N/C–Ar vs Fe–N/C-x) or temperatures (e.g., Fe–N/C-x, x = 700, 800, 900, and 1000 °C) or were obtained with the assistance of different additives (e.g., Fe–N/C–NU vs the other samples).

As shown in Figure 1d, transmission electron microscope (TEM) observation of our optimal sample, the Fe-N/C-900, confirmed its hollow structure, and control samples obtained with different calcination temperatures demonstrate identical morphology and similar size distribution (Figure S2a-d, Supporting Information). Importantly, no metal particles could be found during the TEM observation of these Fe-N/C samples under different magnifications (Figure 1d,e), suggesting the high dispersity of the iron species in the catalyst,

which is favorable for its catalytic performance. This is also supported by the relevant elemental mappings which indicate that iron and nitrogen are homogeneously dispersed within the nanoshell (Figure 1f–i). It shall be mentioned that during the impregnation step the addition of the urea which could coordinate with the Fe (II) cations via its amino group contributes to stabilization the Fe (II) species and prevents it from agglomeration during the pyrolysis. As compared in **Figure 2**a, relatively large Fe aggregates could be found in the control sample Fe–N/C–NU which was prepared under the same condition but without the addition of urea.

The specific surface area of the Fe–N/C is deemed as an important factor that could play an important role in determining their ORR catalytic activity. Inherited from the hollow permeable BR nanoshell, micropores and small mesopores could be observed in the resulting Fe–N/C nanoshells, as shown in Figure 1e. Accordingly, in Figure 2c, at low relative pressure the nitrogen sorption isotherms of all samples display an evident increase, and at a high relative pressure there also exists an obvious hysteresis loop, demonstrating its micro–meso porous structure. As shown in Figure 2d, the pore size distribution also suggests the presence of microporous and mesoporous in the hollow sphere using the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda model. It shall also be mentioned that the technological parameters for the thermal treatment including the calcination temperature and the atmosphere could affect the specific surface area; particularly,

the NH<sub>3</sub>-containing atmosphere under elevated temperature could etch carbonaceous materials and thus might impart a profound role in their specific surface area and their pore volume. Indeed, as shown in **Table 1**, compared with the Fe–N/C–Ar which was calcined in pure Ar, all of those calcined in a mixture of NH<sub>3</sub> and Ar demonstrated much improved specific surface area, clearly showing the etching effect of NH<sub>3</sub> on the carbonaceous frame under high temperature. The temperature also plays a role, as for the four Fe–N/C-*x* samples, their specific surface area (Figure 2c) as well as their porosity (Figure 2d) first increased with the calcination temperature increasing from 700 to 900 °C, which then decreased when the temperature reached 1000 °C (Table 1).

Notably, among the six samples, our best performing catalyst (i.e., Fe–N/C-900) demonstrates the highest Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET)-specific surface area (998.0  $\rm m^2~g^{-1}$ ), and its pore volume reaches 0.63 cm $^3~g^{-1}$ . The affluent pores in the nanoshell of these Fe–N/C samples could enable the active sites in the interior being accessible to the reactants, and the large porosity could support efficient mass transfer during the ORR process.

The crystalline structures of the samples were further evaluated by powder X-ray diffraction analysis (Figure 2a; Figure S3b, Supporting Information). In general, for samples prepared with the pyrolysis temperature above 700 °C, two weak and broad diffraction bands can be observed at 25° and 44°, originating from

the (002) and (101) planes of carbon;<sup>[20]</sup> no additional signals relevant to Fe-based species could be found in the Fe-N/C-900, further indicating the homogeneous dispersion of iron element. In comparison, the control Fe-N/C-NU displays two more peaks at 41.2° and 47.9°, which could be assigned to metallic iron nitride crystals (PDF#77-2206), further proving the important role of urea in stabilizing the Fe (II) species during the pyrolytic process.

The Raman spectra of Fe–N/C-900 and the control sample Fe–N/C–Ar (which was calcined in pure Ar) are shown in Figure 2b. The characteristic peak at  $1327\,\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$  is assigned to the D band, while the other one at  $1582\,\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$  represents the G band; usually, the D band is related to defective sites and disordered carbon, while the G band originates from graphitic carbon. Their intensity ratio,  $I_{\rm D}/I_{\rm G}$ , is 1.04 for Fe–N/C-900 (which was calcined in the mixture of NH<sub>3</sub>/Ar) and 0.97 for the control Fe–N/C–Ar. Carbonaceous frameworks with higher

 $I_{\rm D}/I_{\rm G}$  values are believed to possess higher degree of disorder and defects, which was reported to be beneficial for the ORR catalytic process. [22,23]

Figure S3c,d, Supporting Information, shows the thermogravimetric analysis curves of the Fe-N/C precursors. Between 160 and 300 °C, there is evident loss of weight, which is accompanied with a clear broad peak in the relevant range of the differential scanning calorimeter spectrum. This is attributed to the exothermic ring-opening curing reaction of the benzoxazine ring structure. [24,25] With the continuous loss of hydrocarbons and carbonitrides, the mass of the precursor decreases continuously after 300 °C. As shown in the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy spectrum of the Fe-N/C precursors (Figure S4, Supporting Information), the peaks at 1629, 1509, and 1452 cm<sup>-1</sup> are attributed to the stretching vibration of the benzene ring skeleton; the deformation vibration of methyl appears at 1384 cm<sup>-1</sup>. More importantly, the peak at 750 cm<sup>-1</sup> corresponds to the characteristic absorption of monosubstituted benzene, proving the successful formation of BR. [26-29]

The chemical compositions of the Fe–N/C samples were further analyzed. The presence of Fe, N, C, and O were confirmed by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analysis (Figure S3a, Supporting Information; Table S1, Supporting Information). Various techniques have been used to quantitatively determine the mass fraction of the core elements, namely, Fe and N, in the Fe–N/C-900. Inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) analysis shows that the mass fraction of Fe in the Fe–N/C-900 is about 1.98 wt%, and the content of C, N in the Fe–N/C-900 was further detected by an element analyzer, which shows that C and N account for 79.89 wt%

and 4.87 wt%, respectively. Further shown in Figure 3a, the full X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectrum reveals that Fe-N/C-900 is mainly composed of Fe, N, C, and O, with weight ratio of  $\approx$ 1.54%, 2.7%, 80.4%, and 15.5%, respectively. It shall be mentioned that the XPS analysis is concerned with the surfacesubsurface layer less than 10 nm in depth; this might lead to the discrepancy in the weight ratio of the elements reported by different techniques. Further shown in Figure 3b, due to its low atomic fraction, XPS spectrum of Fe  $2p_{3/2}$  exhibits a weak peak at 711.0 eV which is assigned to Fe<sup>2+</sup> species, confirming the existence of Fe-N<sub>x</sub> active site in the carbonaceous framework.<sup>[30]</sup> Note that, consistent with the XRD pattern, no obvious metallic iron peaks (which occurs at around 706.9 eV)<sup>[31]</sup> can be found on the relevant XPS spectrum, further justifying that all the Fe species exist as Fe-N<sub>x</sub> in the sample Fe-N/C-900. This is due to the strong interaction between the functional groups in the BR nanoshell and the urea and iron (II) in the precursor.

In addition to the N XPS 1s spectra of the Fe–N/C-900 and the control Fe–N/C–Ar shown in Figure 3c,d, the N 1s spectra of the other Fe–N/C-x samples (x=700, 800, and 1000 °C) and the Fe–N/C–NU are shown in Figure S5a–d, Supporting Information. Similar to the typical N 1s spectrum of M–N–C materials, [32–34] the N 1s spectrum of the various Fe–N/C electrocatalysts could be deconvoluted into four major nitrogen species, including the pyridinic N (398.5 eV), the pyrrolic N (400.1 eV), the graphitic N (401.1 eV), and the oxidized N (403.2 eV), as shown in Figure 3c. Note that it is difficult to quantitatively differentiate between Fe–N (399.2 eV) and pyridinic N (398.2–399 eV). [35] The different nitrogen species are shown in **Table 2**. We found that the total nitrogen content in our

a)Note that the different nitrogen species reported in the table is based on XPS analysis which works on the surface and subsurface layer in the Fe–N/C samples.

Fe–N/C-900 is significantly higher than that in the Fe–N/C–Ar, revealing the profound role of the calcination atmosphere in the pyrolysis process and the eventual composition. [ $^{36,37}$ ] It can also be found with the calcination temperature increasing from 700 to  $1000\,^{\circ}$ C; the total nitrogen content in the sample decreases from 3.60 to 1.06 at%.

performance. As shown in Figure 4a,b, the cyclic voltammogram (CV) curves for Fe-N/C-900 and the commercial Pt/C exhibited rectangular shape and uncovered significant reduction peaks at about 0.9 V (vs RHE, similarly thereafter) in O2-saturated solution, deviating obviously from the N<sub>2</sub>-saturated solution, indicating the remarkable ORR activity of Fe-N/C-900 in alkaline condition. The linear scan voltammogram (LSV) was measured from 0.2 to 1.1 V to further confirm its ORR activity (Figure 4c). The half-wave potential of Fe-N/C-900 reaches 0.919 V, surpassing that of the commercial Pt/C which is 0.882 V. To our knowledge, our Fe-N/C is one of the best nonprecious metal catalysts in alkaline electrolyte reported to date (Table S2, Supporting Information).

The control samples Fe-N/C-Ar, Fe-N/C-NU, and N/C-900 exhibit a half-wave potential of 0.887, 0.906, and 0.865 V, respectively (Figure 4c,d). Though being inferior to the Fe-N/C-900, the performances of these control samples are generally remarkable compared with most counterparts reported in the literature.[38-42] To evaluate the intrinsic activity of the catalyst, the normalized mass activity  $(j_m)$  was calculated (Figure S6a, Supporting Information). The mass activities of Fe-N/C-900 catalyst at 0.9 V is 29.7 A  $g_{cat}^{-1}$ , higher than that of the Pt/C (28.0 A  $g_{cat}^{-1}$ , calculated with a loading of 0.1 mg cm<sup>-2</sup>). This, in return, suggests the structural merits of these Fe-N/C nanoshells with hollow feature and the large specific surface area (998.0 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>). In addition, the control electrocatalysts Fe-N/C-x (x = 700, 800 °C) display a half-wave of 0.857 and 0.889 V, respectively, whereas the one calcined at 1000 °C exhibits a value of 0.895 V (Figure S6b, Supporting Information). Such comparative results suggest the important role of the calcination temperature on the catalytic activity.

Furthermore, to understand the reaction kinetics of Fe-N/ C-900, the kinetic parameters were accessed by rotating disk electrode (RDE) tests using the Koutecky-Levich (K-L) equations. Figure 5a shows the relevant ORR polarization curves of Fe-N/C-900 from 400 to 1600 rpm; as shown in the inset, the catalyst shows a significant linear relationship between the current density  $I^{-1}$  and  $\omega^{-1/2}$  (where  $\omega$  is the angular velocity of the disk) from 0.3 to 0.8 V, suggesting that the electron transfer rate within this potential range is independent of the potential. The corresponding electron transfer number was obtained as 4.25 from 0.3 to 0.8 V, indicating an effective four-electron reaction pathway for oxygen reduction on our catalyst.

Considering the error in the number of transferred electrons estimated from the K-L equation, rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) testing was further conducted. As shown in Figure 5b, Fe-N/C-900 exhibits a H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> yield below 7.8%, and the number of transferred electrons obtained by RRDE is close to 4, which was similar to that of Pt/C catalyst. The result is generally consistent with the analysis of the K-L equations. In addition, Fe-N/C-900 hollow spheres show a comparable Tafel slope (74 mV  $dec^{-1}$ ) as the Pt/C catalyst (69 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>) (Figure 5c), further confirming the remarkable electrocatalytic activity for the Fe–N/C-900 sample in 0.1 M KOH solution.

In addition to the catalytic activity of the catalyst, the catalytic stability is also important for the ORR process. An accelerated degradation test was conducted, which was performed by applying potential cycling of 0.6-1.0 V for 5000 cycles (O2-saturated  $0.1 \,\mathrm{m}$  KOH,  $50 \,\mathrm{mV} \,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ ,  $30 \,\mathrm{^{\circ}C}$ ). In Figure 5d, a decay of  $18 \,\mathrm{mV}$ occurred in the half-wave potential  $E_{1/2}$  of Fe-N/C-900 after 5000 continuous cycles; as a comparison, the Pt/C dropped 45 mV in terms of its half-wave potential after the same test (Figure 5e). The stability is further examined via their chronoamperometric response at a given potential of 0.8 V at 1600 rpm

(Figure 5f). The Fe–N/C-900 could maintain 70.47% of the original current density after  $80\,000\,\mathrm{s}$ , whereas the commercial Pt/C catalyst could only retain 59.85% after merely  $20\,000\,\mathrm{s}$ . All these results confirmed the remarkable electrochemical durability of Fe–N/C-900 compared with the commercial Pt/C.

To understand the superior electrocatalytic activity of our Fe–N/C-900, the electric double-layer capacitance  $C_{\rm dl}$  of the various electrocatalysts was further obtained by measuring the relevant CV curves under different scan rates in the non-Faradaic range of 1.05–1.15 V (Figure S7, Supporting Information). As shown in **Figure 6**a, the current density at 1.1 V was plotted linearly versus the scan rate to yield the resulting slope, namely, the  $C_{\rm dl}$ . Among the samples prepared in this work, the Fe–N/C-900 displays the highest  $C_{\rm dl}$  of 18.66 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>. This is consistent with its excellent lectrocatalytic activity as well as its high BET-specific surface area.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopic (EIS) measurements were also conducted in a  $O_2$ -saturated 0.1 M KOH at 0.8 V to further compare the electrical conductivity of the materials. Figure 6b

shows the resulting EIS profiles of all the samples, which is fitted using Zview software with the electrical equivalent circuit shown in the inset. As shown,  $R_1$  is the uncompensated solution resistance,  $R_2$  the charge transfer resistance, and CPE1 is the constant phase element. The Nyquist plots reveal that the Fe–N/C-900 possesses much smaller charge transfer resistance (113  $\Omega$  cm<sup>-2</sup>) than Pt/C (194  $\Omega$  cm<sup>-2</sup>) and other Fe–N/C samples. Such a result indicates that the high electrical conductivity of Fe–N/C-900 is of great importance for its high electrocatalytic activity. [43–45]

#### 2.3. Zn-Air Cell Test of the Optimal Sample

The optimal sample Fe–N/C-900 catalyst was further investigated to explore its potential for practical application. Specifically, zinc–air battery was assembled using the Fe–N/C-900 as the cathode catalyst and Zn foil as the anode in 6.0 M KOH with 0.2 M ZnAc<sub>2</sub> as the electrolyte. The commercial Pt/C was used as the cathode

catalyst for comparison. The open-circuit voltages for the cells assembled with the Fe–N/C-900 and the commercial Pt/C are 1.51 and 1.42 V, respectively, which is consistent with their differentiated ORR performance (**Figure 7**a).

Figure 7b shows the current responses of the Zn–air batteries with various current densities. The overall cell voltage drop for the cell with Fe–N/C-900 was lower than that of Pt/C, indicating the remarkable stability and satisfactory rate performance of the Fe–N/C-900 catalyst. The specific capacity was calculated based on the mass of the Zn consumed. For the Fe–N/C-900, it was estimated to be 779.7 mAh  $\rm g_{zn}^{-1}$  (Figure 7c), higher than that of the commercial Pt/C which is 691.9 mAh  $\rm g_{zn}^{-1}$ . Figure 7d shows the corresponding polarization curves and power density of Zn–air batteries. The battery with the Fe–N/C-900 as cathode could reach a peak power density of 93.5 mW cm<sup>-2</sup>, while the one with the Pt/C as the cathode demonstrates a value of 76.8 mW cm<sup>-2</sup>.

The cycle stability of the battery is an important indicator for practical application. As shown in Figure 7e, the zinc–air battery assembled with Fe–N/C-900 as the cathode electrocatalyst was charged and discharged repetitively at a constant current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>; after being cycled for 40 h, the charge and discharge voltage difference of the battery, which is associated with the severity of the polarization, was maintained within 1.0 V. In comparison, the zinc–air battery constructed with the Pt/C catalysts suffers from severe polarization in less than 24 h. Such comparative results prove the potential of the Fe–N/C-900 catalyst as an excellent ORR catalyst in practical application.

### 3. Conclusion

In summary, a dual-template-assisted polymerization method was established to produce permeable hollow BR nanoshells with

high structural integrity, which, after being pyrolyzed with urea and Fe(II) salt under different temperature and atmosphere, generates a series of porous spherical Fe-N/C nanoshells with various structural features (e.g., specific surface area, portion of micropores and mesopores) and nitrogen compositions. The calcination atmosphere and temperature were found to play a significant role in determining the specific surface area and the nitrogen composition of the resulting Fe-N/C materials. The optimal Fe-N/C electrocatalyst demonstrates a half-wave potential  $E_{1/2}$  of 0.919 V in 0.1 M KOH solution and a maximal power density of 93.5 mW cm<sup>-2</sup> when tested in Zn-air batteries, surpassing those of the commercial Pt/C catalyst. Its excellent ORR electrocatalytic activities originate from its affluent Fe-N<sub>x</sub> active sites, large specific surface area, and high conductivity. This work provides a facile method for controllable synthesis of highly active Fe-N/C ORR electrocatalysts.

## 4. Experimental Section

Materials and Chemicals: Ferrous chloride tetrahydrate, TEOS, Nafion solution (5%), carbon paper (Toray Carbon Paper, Baselayered, TGP-H-60), and Pt/C (20 wt%) were bought from Alfa Aesar. Ethanol, urea, formaldehyde, ethylenediamine, 3-aminophenol, hydrofluoric (HF) acid (40%), and ammonium solution (25–28%) were bought from Sinopharm Chemical Reafent Co. All the chemicals were of analytical grade and used without further purification.

Synthesis of  $SiO_2$  Submicrospheres: In a typical synthesis, TEOS (6.0 mL) was rapidly added into a mixture of deionized water (10.0 mL), ammonium aqueous solution (3.15 mL), and ethanol (75.0 mL). After being stirred at room temperature for 1 h, the as-prepared  $SiO_2$  submicrospheres were separated through centrifugation and washed several times with deionized water and ethanol. The  $SiO_2$  spheres were obtained after drying in vacuum at  $80\,^{\circ}$ C.

Synthesis of Hollow Permeable BR Nanoshells: The as-synthesized SiO<sub>2</sub> submicrospheres (1 g) were redispersed in a mixture of deionized water (140 mL) and ethanol (60 mL) through sonication. Then, toward the mixture, 3-aminophenol (0.64 g), formaldehyde (0.96 mL), ethylenediamine (0.64 mL), and TEOS (0.3 mL) were added successively; subsequently, after being magnetically stirred at 30 °C for 24 h, the BR coated on SiO<sub>2</sub> (BR@SiO<sub>2</sub>) composite was obtained by centrifugation and rinsed with mixture of deionized water and ethanol, which was then dried under 80 °C for 12 h. Afterward, the as-prepared BR@SiO<sub>2</sub> composite was etched using HF aqueous solution (10%, volume) for 24 h to remove the SiO<sub>2</sub> core and those SiO<sub>2</sub> intercalated in the BR nanoshell; thus obtained hollow permeable BR nanoshell after being rinsed with deionized water was dried under 80 °C for 24 h.

Synthesis of a Series of Porous Hollow Fe–N/C Nanoshells: The mixture of two solutions, namely, iron (II) dichloride tetrahydrate (50 mg) in ethanol (2.5 mL) and urea (30 mg) in ethanol (2.5 mL), was added dropwise into the as-prepared ethanolic solution of the hollow permeable BR nanoshell (0.5 g in 100 mL) within 5 min with stirring. After 4 h of continuous stirring, an orange solid was obtained through centrifugation which was dried under 80 °C in vacuum for 12 h. Thus, product was pyrolyzed in a tube furnace at a specific temperature for 4 h with a ramping rate of  $1\,^{\circ}\text{C}$  min $^{-1}$  in a mixture of NH $_3$  and Ar (with a volume ratio of 1:9). Thus-obtained samples were named as Fe–N/C-x (x = 700, 800, 900, and  $1000\,^{\circ}\text{C}$ ), where x denotes the calcination temperature.

Three more control samples were prepared, including the Fe–N/C–Ar, which was calcined in pure Ar; the Fe–N/C–NU which was prepared from pyrolysis of the BR nanoshell impregnated with only  $\text{FeCl}_2$  (i.e., with no urea), and N/C-900 which was prepared with no  $\text{FeCl}_2$ , and other experimental settings are the same as those described earlier. All the three control samples were calcined at 900 °C.

The aforementioned samples were used straightforwardly for ORR electrocatalysis without any posttreatments, and the relevant characterizations

were specified in the supporting information. Such Fe–N/C nanoshells are all porous and hollow in structure, but they are different in their specific surface area and the nitrogen composition.

*Electrochemical Measurements*: All ORR performances were conducted in  $O_2/N_2$ -saturated 0.1 M KOH solution at 30 °C on a three-electrode system with a CHI 760 electrochemical workstation with a constant rotating speed of 1600 rpm. Unless otherwise specified, the potential reported was referenced to the reversible hydrogen electrode using the equation  $E_{\rm RHE} = E_{\rm (Hg/HgO)} + 0.098 + 0.0591 ^{\rm s} {\rm pH}$ . All current densities were corrected for the iR drop with 80% compensation. The loading on the electrode tip of nonprecious metal catalyst was 0.3 mg cm<sup>-2</sup> and the commercial sample Pt/C is 0.1 mg cm<sup>-2</sup> (or 20 μg<sub>Pt</sub> cm<sup>-2</sup>).

In brief, to evaluate the ORR electrocatalytic performance of our electrocatalysts, the relevant cyclic CV, LSV, and the accelerated degradation testing were conducted; in addition, the hydrogen peroxide yield, the transferred electron number, the electric double-layer capacitance  $C_{\rm dl}$ , EIS, and mass activity were also evaluated and compared. The detailed experimental procedures are described in the Supporting Information.

Zn–Air Battery Test: Zn–air battery tests were conducted on self-made electrochemical cells to evaluate the practical oxygen reduction catalytic activity of our samples. Zn foil was used as anode and gas diffusion layer (Teflon-coated carbon fiber paper,  $1.0\,{\rm cm}^2)$  loaded with the catalyst (a loading  $1.0\,{\rm mg\,cm}^{-2}$  for nonprecious catalysts and  $0.5\,{\rm mg\,cm}^{-2}$  for Pt/C) as the air cathode in  $6.0\,{\rm M}$  KOH with  $0.2\,{\rm M}$  ZnAc<sub>2</sub>.  $^{[46,47]}$  The discharge measurements of Zn–air batteries were performed on the battery cycling system (LAND CT2001A). The polarization curves were recorded by CHI 760E electrochemical workstation.

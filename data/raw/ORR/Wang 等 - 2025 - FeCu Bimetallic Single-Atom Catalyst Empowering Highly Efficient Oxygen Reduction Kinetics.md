Iron and nitrogen co-doped carbon materials (Fe-N-C) have garnered widespread attention owing to their highly active Fe-N<sub>4</sub> sites. Here, we proposed a novel approach for synthesizing bimetallic single-atom catalysts by introducing Cu atoms into Fe-N-C. The resultant Fe-Cu-NC catalyst exhibited a large specific surface area. Moreover, it had a superior half-wave potential of 0.890 V (vs RHE) in alkaline media. Density functional theory calculations disclosed that the introduction of Cu augmented the adsorption capacity of Fe-N<sub>4</sub> active sites concerning oxygen intermediates, thus accelerating the reaction pathway and markedly enhancing the catalytic activity of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). When employed as the cathode of a zinc-air battery, the Fe-Cu-NC catalyst manifested superior performance, with a top power density reaching 183.1 mW cm<sup>-2</sup> and a specific capacity reaching <sup>1</sup><sub>Zn</sub>. This study put forward a promising methodology to refine and boost the ORR activities of Fe-N-C-based catalysts 787 mAh g<sup>-</sup> with atomic dispersion.

The serious environmental deterioration caused by conventional non-renewable fossil fuels urgently requires the hunt for highefficiency and sustainable energy sources. 1-4 Fuel cells as well as metal-air batteries are environmentally friendly, high-performance and reliable energy devices,<sup>5–7</sup> presenting promising solutions. The development of high-efficiency oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts is of paramount importance for facilitating the extensive commercialization of fuel cells. At present, commercial ORR catalysts mainly rely on platinum-based substances. 8–10 However, they are limited by their high cost and instability. 11,12 Thus, finding inexpensive yet high-performing non-precious metal ORR catalysts poses both a major challenge and a great opportunity. 13,14

Metal-nitrogen-carbon (M-N-C) materials possessing carbonbased nanostructures have come to the fore as attractive substitutes for platinum-based catalysts. This is because of their straightforward preparation process, outstanding catalytic performance, and the possibility of attaining near-100% atomic utilization rates. 15-1 Single-atom catalysts, which possess controllable electronic structures and outstanding catalytic activity, have been widely researched for diverse applications. <sup>20–24</sup> Recently, Chen's team pointed out the details of the reaction mechanisms of different metal combinations in ORR reactions, such as electron transfer and intermediate adsorption, providing ideas for the construction of more different combinations of diatomic sites in the future.<sup>21</sup>

Both experimental and computational standpoints have validated that the transition metal nitrogen with single atoms (M-Nx) coordination species in M-N-C materials serves as the principal active centers triggering the ORR process.<sup>26,27</sup> Catalysts based on Fe-N-C have drawn significant interest, particularly Fe-N<sub>4</sub> sites, owing to their remarkable catalytic performance. <sup>28–30</sup> However, their activity and durability are limited by two main factors. Firstly, the strong binding connects the Fe active center with the reaction intermediates (\*OH and \*OOH), forming an excessively strong chemical bond, which makes the adsorption of the reaction intermediates on the surface of the active center too stable. This hinders the desorption of the products and slows down the ORR kinetics.<sup>31</sup> Secondly, the Fe-N-C-based catalysts display a propensity to instigate the Fenton reaction within an alkaline milieu. Consequently, this leads to the oxidative degradation of the carbon-based support and the proton-exchange-membrane fuel cell units.<sup>32,33</sup> Introducing a second metal is a potent strategy to optimize the operation of Fe-N-C-based catalysts. The interaction of Fe with the second metal is capable of precisely adjusting the coordination environment of Fe-N<sub>4</sub> active centers and achieving an equilibrium between the reactant activation and the product desorption.<sup>34,35</sup> Additionally, this interaction can improve the binding strength between reaction intermediates and Fe active sites.<sup>36–3</sup>

The selection of appropriate preparation methods and carriers is crucial for designing high-performance bimetallic single atom catalysts. Zeolitic Imidazolate Framework (ZIF-8) is a kind of crystal with pores, <sup>39,40</sup> and it possesses a fairly large specific surface area, porosity as well as outstanding thermal shock stability, thus offering an ideal platform for enclosing and loading metal atoms. 41,42 Dopamine (PDA) contains numerous -OH and nitrogen-containing functional groups. It can form covalent bonds or electrostatic attractions with metal cations, making it a widely used ligand for metal ions. 43

In our research, ZIF-8 served as a nanocage for entrapping small Cu(acac)<sub>2</sub> molecules throughout the self-assembly procedure of Zn<sup>2+</sup> and 2-methylimidazole. PDA ligands and Fe ions were introduced to grow layered Fe-PDA complexes on the surface of Cu-encapsulated ZIF-8. During pyrolysis, the Cu atoms located in the gaps of ZIF-8 strengthened the carbon matrix. They prevented the framework from collapsing and provided favorable conditions for anchoring Fe atoms. As a result, the density of active Fe atoms increased. After acid washing and pyrolysis treatment, Fe-Cu bimetallic single atom catalyst (Fe-Cu-NC) was obtained. The resultant catalyst displayed a half-wave potential (E<sub>1/2</sub>) reaching 0.890 V (vs RHE) in 0.1 M KOH solution, and also exhibited superior steadiness and methanol resistance. When employed as the cathode-side catalyst in zinc-air batteries (ZAB), Fe-Cu-NC exhibited outstanding performance. Its open-circuit voltage reached as high as 1.48 V, showing a significant increase compared to 1.43 V of Pt/C. The top power density reached  $183.1\,\mathrm{mW\,cm^{-2}}$ , far exceeding  $163.6\,\mathrm{mW\,cm^{-2}}$  of Pt/C. Moreover, the specific capacity reached 787 mAh  $g^{-1}_{Zn}$ , which was higher than 750 mAh  $g^{-1}_{Zn}$  of Pt/C. These data fully demonstrated that Fe-Cu-NC comprehensively outperformed Pt/C in relevant performance aspects and had prominent advantages.

### **Explorative Substances and Approaches**

Base materials and chemical agents.—2-Methylimidazole (AR, 98%), Zn(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>·6H<sub>2</sub>O (AR, 99%), Cu(acac)<sub>2</sub> (AR, 97%), Tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (AR, 99.8%), dopamine hydrochloride (AR, 98%), Fe(NO3)3·9H2O (AR, 99.9%), ethanol (AR, 99.9%) and HCl (AR, 36%) were all acquired from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent in Shanghai, China.

Cu-ZIF-8 preparation method.—A total of 4.7 g of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O and 64 mg of Cu(acac)2 were added into 100 ml of methanol and then dissolved thoroughly to obtain solution A. Separately, 10.0 g of 2-MeIm was dissolved in 100 ml methanol as solution B. The two solutions were mixed, ultrasonicated for 10 min and then stirred at room temperature for 24 h. The yellow solid (Cu-ZIF-8) was separated via centrifugation. Next, it was rinsed repeatedly with ethanol to get rid of impurities and dried in a vacuum until a constant weight was achieved, which meant the drying process ended.

Fe-PDA@Cu-ZIF-8 preparation method.—A total of 0.25 g of Cu-ZIF-8 and 0.2 g of tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane were carefully measured out and then slowly introduced into 100 ml of a 1:1 ethanol/DI water mixture. After that, the mixture was sonicated for a certain period of time to facilitate the dispersion of the substances. In a separate solution, 30 mg of PDA and 20 mg Fe(NO3)3·9H2O were added into 100 ml of DI water. The two solutions underwent mixing, followed by 24 h agitation at ambient temperature. Post-reaction, the emerging gray precipitate (Fe-PDA@Cu-ZIF-8) was separated via centrifugation. It was then cleansed and subsequently dried in a vacuum environment at 60 °C.

Fe-Cu-NC preparation method.—Fe-PDA@Cu-ZIF-8 was heated to 950 °C with a ramp rate of 5 °C min−<sup>1</sup> in an atmosphere of argon for 2 h. The resulting black substance was acid-leached with 3 M HCl at 80 °C for 12 h and then reheated at 950 °C under argon. For contrast, Fe-NC, Cu-NC and NC were fabricated via the same process as that of Fe-Cu-NC mentioned above, yet without the addition of Fe(NO3)3·9H2O and/or Cu(acac)2, which served as control specimens.

## Results and Discussion

Structural characterization of the catalysts.—The synthetic process of Fe-Cu-NC was shown in Fig. [1a](#page-2-0). During the self-assembly of Zn2<sup>+</sup> and 2-methylimidazole, Cu(acac)2 as the Cu source was fixed in ZIF-8 monomer gaps, yielding Cu-ZIF-8. In the subsequent heat treatment stage, Cu strengthened the structure of the carbon matrix and provided a favorable attachment environment for Fe atoms. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of ZIF-8 and Cu-ZIF-8 showed that the signal peaks of Cu-ZIF-8 shift to the left. This meant that the incorporation of Cu(acac)2 increased the interplanar spacing of ZIF-8, confirming the successful synthesis (Supporting Information, Fig. S1). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images showed that the morphologies of Cu-ZIF-8 and ZIF-8 were similar, indicating that the incorporation of Cu(acac)2 had almost no impact on the original morphology of ZIF-8, and its unique structure was retained (Supporting Information, Fig. S2). Cu-ZIF-8 nanoparticles (NPs) were dispersed in Tris solution. Subsequently, an aqueous solution containing PDA and Fe salts was incorporated into the mixture. The abundant functional groups of PDA could complex with Fe3<sup>+</sup>. Subsequently, through the self-polymerization reaction, the Fe source was uniformly loaded onto the surface of Cu-ZIF-8. This process not only realized the effective fixation of the Fe source but also provided a N source for the catalyst system. In the process of mixing, PDA self-polymerized around Cu-ZIF-8 NPs, forming a polydopamine shell. Fe cations, which were attracted by the abundant -OH and nitrogen-containing functional groups of PDA, were incorporated into the shell through covalent bonds or electrostatic interactions. Simultaneously, some Fe cations were reduced to Fe NPs and anchored onto the PDA shell, resulting in the formation of Fe-PDA@Cu-ZIF-8. The Fe-Cu-NC catalyst was finally obtained through pyrolysis and acid washing treatment.

The transmission electron microscope (TEM) images indicated that among various catalysts, the Cu-NC catalyst exhibited an extremely regular and nearly perfect polyhedral morphology. In sharp contrast, the Fe-NC catalyst and the NC catalyst, which lacked

the Cu element, had a relatively inferior polyhedral morphology, with different degrees of structural flaws and irregularities. The Fe-Cu-NC catalyst, with its unique bimetallic active sites, demonstrated a polyhedral morphology highly similar to that of the Cu-NC catalyst, and the two showed good consistency at the microstructural level. This phenomenon strongly suggested that the presence of the Cu element played a crucial role in maintaining the polyhedral morphology of the catalyst and was a key factor in ensuring its structural integrity and stability (Figs. 1b-1e). The diffraction pattern of electrons in the selected area (SAED) of Fe-Cu-NC exhibited a series of halos, indicating an amorphous structure (Supporting Information, Fig. S3). During the heat treatment process, Cu(acac)<sub>2</sub> carbonized alongside the ZIF-8 framework. The resulting carbon matrix, reinforced by Cu-N coordination, provided a larger specific surface area and a more stable structure. This enhanced framework facilitated the infiltration and dispersion of Fe atoms, leading to a higher density of active sites. In contrast, the absence of Cu(acac)<sub>2</sub> during synthesis resulted in a less stable carbon framework and hindered the infiltration and dispersion of Fe atoms.

To further characterize the structure of Fe-Cu-NC catalysts, highresolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) was employed. These images revealed a well-dispersed structure without discernible metal nanograins or aggregations in the matrix composed of carbon (Fig. 2a). Elemental mapping images confirmed the uniform distribution of C, N, O, Fe and Cu elements across the catalyst surface (Fig. 2b). Remarkably, high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy images (AC-HAADF-STEM) emphasized the excellent morphology of the catalyst, and the uniformly distributed bright spots therein strongly indicated that Fe and Cu were present as single atoms (Fig. 2c). Additional AC-HAADF-STEM images were presented in Fig. S4. The X-ray diffractometry (XRD) graphs of all samples showed two broad peaks around 24° and 43°, which corresponded to the (002) and (101) lattice planes within the graphite-carbon structure respectively. 44,45 The lack of other diffraction peaks verified the amorphous characteristic of the catalysts (Fig. 2d).

The N<sub>2</sub> adsorption-desorption processes and pore-size distribution determinations of all samples were carried out at 77.3 K (Figs. 2e and 2f). Each sample exhibited a typical Type IV isotherm, accompanied by a Type H4 hysteresis loop. This characteristic intuitively revealed the presence of mesoporous and microporous structures in the samples. 46 From the perspective of the ORR, these abundant and unique pore structures promoted the transport and diffusion processes of substances within the catalyst, enabled reactants to rapidly reach the active sites. At the same time, it also facilitated the diffusion of reaction products away, effectively prevented the accumulation of products at the active sites and improved the catalytic reaction efficiency. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) specific surface area of Fe-Cu-NC, reaching 1133.4 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>, was notably greater than that of Fe-NC (756.0 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>), Cu-NC (815.4 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>), and NC (621.0 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>) as shown in Table S1. This implied that the occurrence of Cu boosted the particular surface area belonging to the catalyst. The large specific surface area not only offered more active sites but also facilitated the diffusion and transportation of substances, thereby enhancing the reaction rate of ORR. Moreover, during the ORR process, the regions with a large specific surface area could effectively disperse the stress changes generated by the reaction. These stress changes were evenly distributed among more active sites, avoiding stress concentration in a certain area. As a result, the rapid damage to the local structure of the catalyst was prevented, ensuring that the catalytic performance of the catalyst remained stable over a long period. Additionally, the pore size distribution curves further corroborated the simultaneous existence of micropores and mesopores within the catalyst.

X-ray photoelectron spectrometric analysis (XPS) was employed to examine the elemental makeup and chemical states within Fe-Cu-NC. Based on the XPS survey spectral information, the existence of Fe, Cu, N, C, and O elements was verified (Supporting Information, Fig. S5). For comparison, the survey spectra of Fe-NC, Cu-NC and NC were presented in Fig. S6. The spectrum of C 1 s for the Fe-Cu-NC material could potentially be resolved into three typical characteristic peaks (Fig. 3a). Each of the peaks was assigned to

<span id="page-4-0"></span>Figure 3. The high-resolution XPS spectra of Fe-Cu-NC in the following aspects: (a) C 1 s, (b) N 1 s, (c) Fe 2p and (d) Cu 2p.

C-C, C-N, and either C-O or O=C-O bonds, and the emergence of C-N bonds evinced that nitrogen doping in the carbon frameworks had been successfully achieved. The high-resolution power N 1 s spectrogram was decomposable into four peaks, corresponding respectively to pyridinic N (at 398.57 eV), pyrrolic N (at 399.61 eV), graphitic N (at 401.24 eV), and oxidized N (at 404.51 eV) (Fig. 3b). 47-49 Notably, the intensities of graphitic N and pyridinic N were relatively high. A high content of graphitic N could not only regulate the electronic structure of the catalyst but also increase the electrical conductivity of the catalyst, which was conducive to the transport of electrons during the reaction. Pyridinic N could provide additional coordination active sites for metal atoms. It also had a strong electronegativity and exhibited excellent adsorption of O2, effectively reducing the reaction energy barrier of the ORR. The presence of pyrrolic N could adjust the adsorption strength of the catalyst for the intermediate products in the ORR process, thereby enhancing the catalytic activity and stability of ORR (Supporting Information, Table S2). The Fe 2p spectrum (Fig. 3c) showed peaks corresponding to Fe<sup>2+</sup> and Fe<sup>3+</sup> states, and the Cu 2p spectrum (Fig. 3d) showed peaks corresponding to Cu<sup>+</sup> and Cu<sup>2+</sup> states. The absence of significant Fe<sup>0</sup> or Cu<sup>0</sup> signals in XPS, HR-TEM, AC-HAADF-STEM and XRD confirmed the atomic dispersion of Fe and Cu.

For the purpose of determining the metal content, inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) analysis revealed that the iron content in Fe-Cu-NC was 1.88 wt% and the copper content was 0.06 wt%. Its iron content exceeded 1.52 wt% of the iron content in Fe-NC (Supporting Information, Table S3). This further demonstrated that Fe-Cu-NC had more Fe active sites.

Catalytic performance of the resultant catalysts for ORR.—The ORR catalytic activity of the samples in 0.1 M KOH was evaluated employing a three-electrode configuration. Firstly, the cyclic voltammetry (CV) test was conducted in 0.1 M KOH saturated with either  $N_2$  or  $O_2$  at a scanning rate of  $5 \text{ mV s}^{-1}$  (Supporting Information, Fig. S7). For the Fe-Cu-NC catalyst, a cathodic electron-gaining peak emerged in the O<sub>2</sub>-saturated solution, yet it was absent in the N<sub>2</sub>-saturated solution. This phenomenon thereby validated the ORR activity of the sample. Among all the samples compared, Fe-Cu-NC exhibited relatively excellent cathodic reduction peak potential, indicating its strongest ORR activity. At a rotational speed of 1600 rpm and a scan rate of 5 mV s<sup>-1</sup>, the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves of the samples were acquired, as presented in Fig. 4a. Compared with other catalysts like Pt/C, Fe-Cu-NC presented an outstanding performance, featuring a relatively high  $E_{1/2}$  reaching 0.890 V and an initial potential ( $E_{onset}$ ) of 1.0 V, as shown in Fig. 4b. Compared with Fe-NC, Cu-NC, and NC, the enhanced performance of Fe-Cu-NC might result from the existence of numerous Fe active sites, which facilitated the ORR reaction. As depicted in Fig. 4c, Fe-Cu-NC presented a lower Tafel slope of

<span id="page-5-0"></span>Figure 4. (a) LSV polarization traces to make a comparison. (b) Comparative analysis of  $E_{onset}$  and  $E_{1/2}$ . (c) Tafel curves. (d) At a rotation speed of 1600 rpm in 0.1 M KOH, the electron transfer number and  $H_2O_2$  yield for Fe-Cu-NC, Fe-NC, Cu-NC, NC as well as Pt/C were measured. (e) Linear sweep voltammetry curves for Fe-Cu-NC at diverse rotation rates. The inserted figure displays the associated K-L plots related to distinct potential levels.

85.9 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>. In the process of the ORR, catalysts with a smaller Tafel slope could achieve a higher reaction rate under relatively low potential conditions. This meant that they could significantly reduce the activation energy of the reaction, making the reaction more likely to occur. Consequently, the catalytic activity was greatly enhanced, demonstrating excellent catalytic performance.

In order to study the energy barrier and reaction pathway of ORR, the electron transfer number (n) and the hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) yield of the catalysts were measured with the utilization of a Rotating Ring-Disk Electrode (RRDE) within the voltage interval from 0.2 V to 0.8 V. The obtained results showed that Fe-Cu-NC presented the lowest H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> yield, varying from 0.7% to 3.5%, along with a high electron transfer number spanning from 3.93 to 3.99 (Fig. 4d). It could be inferred that the Fe-Cu-NC catalyst played a crucial part in the 4e<sup>-</sup> pathway of the ORR. Nevertheless, in contrast to Fe-Cu-NC, the other samples exhibited a high H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> yield and a low electron transfer number in the identical test conditions. In the ORR, Fe-Cu-NC had a high electron transfer number, which meant it could prompt O2 molecules to acquire more electrons, thus forming more stable products and driving the reaction to proceed efficiently. As an intermediate product of the ORR, the low H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> yield in the Fe-Cu-NC system indicated that it could effectively suppress side reactions and significantly enhance the reaction selectivity. This fully demonstrated that the presence of Cu could slow down the Fenton reaction and enhance the activity of the ORR, providing a crucial basis for the optimization of related reactions. The LSV curves of Fe-Cu-NC at rotational speeds from 400 to 2025 rpm were presented in Fig. 4e. According to them, the electron transfer number within 0.3-0.6 V was computed via the Koutecky-Levich equation (K-L, insert of Fig. 4e). In line with the RRDE findings, the average transferred electron number was around 4. Meanwhile, at different rotational speeds, the LSV curves of Fe-NC, Cu-NC, and NC and their related K-L plots were also presented in Fig. S8.

A chronoamperometry measurement was carried out to evaluate the stability features and resistance to methanol of Fe-Cu-NC, Fe-NC,

Cu-NC, and Pt/C (Fig. 4f). After 52000 s, the current density of Fe-Cu-NC dropped by 5.5%, much lower relative to Pt/C (50.0%), Fe-NC (29.1%), and Cu-NC (43.0%). In an alkaline environment, the Pt/ C catalyst was extremely susceptible to corrosion, causing the Pt NPs to detach and thus greatly accelerating the failure process of the catalyst. In sharp contrast, the Cu in the Fe-Cu-NC catalyst optimized the coordination environment of the FeN<sub>4</sub> active sites, endowing it with a more stable electronic structure. Therefore, the stability of the Fe-Cu-NC catalyst was significantly improved. Moreover, when 1 M methanol was added, the current densities of Fe-NC, Cu-NC and Pt/C decreased sharply, while the current density of Fe-Cu-NC showed no obvious change, indicating its superior methanol tolerance. We further tested the stability of the Fe-Cu-NC catalyst under high-voltage conditions. The experimental results showed (Supporting Information, Fig. S9) that as the voltage increased, the stability of the Fe-Cu-NC catalyst exhibited a downward trend. This was likely because under high-voltage conditions, the corrosiveness of the electrochemical environment in which the catalyst was located was significantly enhanced, and some key components in the Fe-Cu-NC catalyst were highly likely to have undergone dissolution or oxidation. This not only directly damaged the original ordered microstructure of the catalyst but also led to the loss of a large number of active sites, making it difficult for the catalyst to maintain its high-efficiency catalytic performance and ultimately resulting in a significant reduction in stability. We also systematically compared the performance of the Fe-Cu-NC catalyst in the ORR with that of other catalysts reported in recent literatures (Supporting Information, Table S4).

By comparing the ORR features of Fe-Cu-NC, Fe-NC, Cu-NC, and NC, it was found that the Fe-Cu-NC catalyst outperformed the others. The main reason could be the following aspects: During the carbonization, Cu fortified the framework of the catalyst, which augmented the specific surface area. More Fe atoms entered the carbon layer and were fixed by N atoms, thus enhancing the density of Fe active sites, speeding up the catalytic process, and enhancing the ORR performance.

<span id="page-6-0"></span>Figure 5. The structure illustrations of three models of FeCuN8, FeN4 and CuN4..

Theoretical study.—Density functional theory (DFT)-based calculations were carried out to explore the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance of the catalyst. Five structural models were constructed for the ORR analysis (Fig. [5](#page-6-0)). Initially, the formation energies (Eform) of models 1, 2, and 3 of FeCuN8 were assessed to determine the most favorable configuration, with values of

−4.61 eV, −5.78 eV, and −4.67 eV obtained, respectively. As a result, Model 2 was chosen as the most promising structure due to its lowest formation energy (Supporting Information, Fig. S10). The initial step of the ORR involves the adsorption of the O2 molecule at the active site (metal atom) of the catalysts. During the ORR process, a strong O2 adsorption energy made O2 adsorb rapidly and

firmly on the catalyst surface, shortened the reaction induction period, accelerated the reaction start, and enhanced the overall efficiency. It also reduced the activation energy of  $O_2$  and the energy barriers of subsequent electron transfer, making it easier for the reaction to overcome the energy barriers, proceed along a low-energy path, and promoted the smooth occurrence of each step of the ORR. The adsorption energies ( $E_{ads}$   $O_2$ ) for FeN<sub>4</sub>, CuN<sub>4</sub>, FeCuN<sub>8</sub> (Fe site) and FeCuN<sub>8</sub> (Cu site) were calculated as  $-0.87\,\mathrm{eV}$ ,  $-0.16\,\mathrm{eV}$ ,  $-0.77\,\mathrm{eV}$  and  $0.46\,\mathrm{eV}$ , respectively. These results indicate that iron exhibits a stronger interaction with the intermediate compared to copper (Supporting Information, Fig. S11). Therefore, the ORR process primarily occurs at the iron site within the FeCuN<sub>8</sub> structure.

In the subsequent ORR steps, the process begins with the initial hydrogenation of  $O_2$ . During the conversion from  $*O_2$  to \*OOH, the  $CuN_4$  catalyst exhibits a relatively small free energy decrease (-0.07~eV) (Supporting Information, Fig. S12). This step serves as the potential-determining step (PDS) for  $CuN_4$ , with an associated reaction overpotential of 1.16 V (Fig. 6a), indicating relatively low catalytic activity. In contrast, both  $FeN_4$  and  $FeCuN_8$  display free energy changes close to the standard reaction potential in this step, with the synergistic interaction between Fe and Cu in  $FeCuN_8$  enhancing the hydrogenation process. Notably, during the initial dehydration step ( $*OOH \rightarrow *O$ ), the  $FeCuN_8$  system shows a smaller free energy change compared to  $FeN_4$ , which directly results in the lowest overpotential (0.63 V) in subsequent hydrogenation steps ( $*O\rightarrow *OH$ ). Consequently, the  $FeCuN_8$  system demonstrates superior catalytic performance.

Subsequently, electronic structure calculations were performed to elucidate the intrinsic mechanism underlying the enhanced catalytic performance. At the Fermi level, both FeN<sub>4</sub> and CuN<sub>4</sub> exhibit an approximate band gap of 0.2 eV; in contrast, FeCuN<sub>8</sub> shows a higher density of states, indicative of superior electrical conductivity (Fig. 6b). Furthermore, the d-band centers ( $\varepsilon_d$ ) of the Fe and Cu atoms in FeCuN<sub>8</sub> are -0.33 eV and -2.99 eV, respectively (Fig. 6c),

representing an upward shift relative to the  $\varepsilon_d$  levels of the original FeN<sub>4</sub> and CuN<sub>4</sub> systems. According to d-band center theory, <sup>50</sup> a higher  $\varepsilon_d$  of the active site corresponds to fewer antibonding states involved in adsorption, thereby enhancing the interaction between the active site and reaction intermediate. This phenomenon accounts for the superior ORR activity observed in the FeCuN<sub>8</sub> system. Moreover, the charge density difference of the \*OOH intermediate in the FeCuN<sub>8</sub> system reveals an extensive charge transfer region across the O-O bond (Fig. 6d), further corroborating its enhanced electron exchange capability. Consequently, oxygen molecules are progressively activated through hydrogenation, thereby facilitating the ORR process.

Zinc-air battery performance.—In order to investigate the application of the Fe-Cu-NC catalyst in energy devices, a primary zinc-air battery (ZAB) was fabricated. As illustrated in Fig. 7a, the ZAB featured a zinc sheet as the anode, with Fe-Cu-NC coated onto carbon paper acting as the air cathode catalyst, and a mixed solution of KOH and Zn(OAc)<sub>2</sub> serving as the electrolyte solution. For the sake of comparison, the Pt/C catalyst was also examined under identical conditions. As illustrated in Fig. 7b, Fe-Cu-NC obtained an open-circuit voltage of 1.48 V, which exceeded that of Pt/C (1.43 V). Under identical conditions, the battery discharge LSV profiles employing Fe-Cu-NC and Pt/C were logged. Subsequently, the corresponding discharge power densities were calculated, as presented in Fig. 7c. At an equal voltage, the discharge current of Fe-Cu-NC was greater than that of Pt/C, attaining a top power density of 183.1 mW cm<sup>-2</sup>. Moreover, at a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, the Fe-Cu-NC battery boasted a specific capacity (787 mAh  $g^{-1}{}_{Zn}$ ) in contrast to Pt/C (750 mAh  $g^{-1}{}_{Zn}$ ) (Fig. 7d). The Potential Discharge Profiles with distinct fixed current density values were presented in Fig. 7e, and the findings revealed that the discharge voltage of Fe-Cu-NC was superior to that of Pt/C. By connecting two sets of Fe-Cu-NC-based ZABs in series, success was achieved in lighting up the small bulb at a voltage of 1.5 V (Fig. 7f). To evaluate the battery

stability, we conducted an alternating charge-discharge test on the battery at a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. The charge and discharge times were each 10 min. The test results showed that the Fe-Cu-NC-based battery exhibited good stability. After continuously operating for more than 800 cycles, its performance remained stable (Supporting Information, Fig. S13). To highlight the advantages of Fe-Cu-NC in the new energy field, we compared the performance of zinc-air batteries reported in recent literatures (Supporting Information, Table S5). Based on these results, Fe-Cu-NC has remarkable application prospects in the field of new energy devices.

#### Conclusions

In conclusion, experimental results showed that adding Cu increases the catalyst's specific surface area, leading to more Fe active sites on its surface and thus accelerating ORR. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that the introduction of Cu effectively reduces the activation energy barrier of the reaction, enhances the adsorption capacity of Fe-N $_4$  for oxygen intermediates, and increases the reaction rate of ORR. Importantly, its effectiveness is also evident in practical applications, as demonstrated by its excellent performance as the air-cathode catalyst in a ZAB.

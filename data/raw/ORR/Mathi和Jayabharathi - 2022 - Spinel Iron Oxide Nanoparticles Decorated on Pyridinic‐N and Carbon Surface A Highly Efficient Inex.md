The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) have been established widely owing to their significance in water electrolyzers, fuel cells and metal-air batteries. The ORR electron transfer number have been calculated from K L plot as 3.1 (Fe3O4/ N2 xC-500), 3.8 (Fe3O4/ N2 xC-600), 3.6 (Fe3O4/N2 XC-700) and 3.2 (Fe3O4/N2 XC-800). At 3 mAcm <sup>2</sup> , the half-wave potential has been determined as 0.66 V (Fe3O4/N2 XC-500), 0.76 V (Fe3O4/N2 XC-600), 0.75 V (Fe3O4/N2 XC-700) and 0.68 V (Fe3O4/N2 XC-800). At 10 mAcm <sup>2</sup> , the OER potential for Fe3O4/N2 XC-500, Fe3O4/N2 XC-600, Fe3O4/ N2 XC-700 and Fe3O4/N2 XC-800 electrocatalysts were determined as 1.61, 1.58, 1.62 and 1.66 V, respectively. The ORR: OER electrode potentials were found to be 0.95, 0.82, 0.87 and 0.93 V for Fe3O4/N2 XC-500, Fe3O4/N2 XC-600, Fe3O4/N2 XC-700 and Fe3O4/N2 XC-800 electrocatalysts, respectively by using solar to hydrogen fuel device conversion scale. The ORR/OER Tafel slopes were calculated as 78/89 mV/dec (Fe3O4/N2 XC-500), 73/78 mV/dec (Fe3O4/N2 XC-600), 76/83 mV/dec (Fe3O4/ N2 XC-700) and 79/98 mV/dec (Fe3O4/N2 XC-800). Among the new born oxygen vacancy (Vo) spinel oxide electrocatalysts, Fe3O4/N2 XC-600 exhibit an exceptional oxygen electrode activity with 0.82 V in 0.1 M KOH due to robust double exchange interconnection (DEI) between stable magnetite spinel Fe3O4 and N2 XC.

capability.[17,18] Mixed-valence transition metal spine oxide structure were identified as high active electrocatalysts for the ORR in low alkaline conditions due to their high abundance, very low cost and high redox chemistry.[19,20] Water splitting into O2 and H2 become a potential strategy to produce hydrogen fuels for renewable energy.[21–23] The bulk-scale of water electrolyzer require highly active electrocatalysts which can overcome the high overpotential issues.[24,25] A commercialized water electrolyzer operated at cell voltage of 1.8-2.0 V (*>* theoretical 1.23 V) can be recognized by air batteries[26,27] hence, earth abundant and efficient electrocatalysts for OER/ ORR is of

## **Introduction**

The materials for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) as well as oxygen evolution reaction (OER) show great contribution in renewable energy platform such as metal-air batteries and fuel cells.[1,2] A cathode decorated by bi-functional catalyst for OER as well as ORR become desirable, the reaction is stimulated independently by maintaining the equilibrium status of O2/OH in opposite directions.[3–6] Though, IrO2/RuO2 was widely used as OER electrocatalysts and Pt-based materials as ORR electrocatalysts,[7–9] high cost, low abundance and lack of stability of noble catalysts scarcity prevents commercial applications.[10,11] The precious catalysts are unable to activate both OER and ORR by employing one noble metal electrocatalyst.[12,13] Therefore, efforts have been exploited towards electrochemically active, earth-abundant and stable non-precious bifunctional electrocatalysts by using cost-effective synthetic channel for the enhancement of energy devices.

The bimetallic Fe/Co-NC[14] and multifunctional Mo-N C@MoS2 and Co-NX-C[15,16] catalysts exhibit excellent performances in Zn-air battery. The intermetallic FeNi3 electrocatalysts for OER and ORR show excellent physiochemical properties because of wide range of source, non-toxic, superconductivity, low price, memory effects and hydrogen storage have been developed for highly electric conductive and double exchange interaction (DEI) magnetite spinel iron oxide (bulk oxide) nanoparticles decorated on pyridinic N2 x-doped carbon electrocatalysts (Fe3O4/N2 xC) for ORR and OER. Where, the double exchange interaction constructing covalent oxygen vacancy (Vo) and nanoheterojunction in spinel oxide. Nanoheterojunction was assembled between spinel oxide and N2 xC by producing covalent bonds at the edge, and rich Vo were created via solid-state thermal approach (details in Scheme 1 and experimental section). The strongly interconnected spinel oxide nanoparticle electrocatalsts shows unexceptional superior long-term stability and activity. The ORR E1/2 for Fe3O4/N2 XC-600 (0.76 V) was found to be 0.10, 0.17 and 0.88 V positive shift relative to that of Fe3O4/N2 XC-500, Fe3O4/N2 XC-700 and Fe3O4/

#### **Results and Discussion**

Scheme. 1 illustrates the synthetic process of highly conductive magnetite spinel oxide Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/N<sub>2-x</sub>C electrocatalyst. The OER/ ORR electrocatalytic activity of Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/N<sub>2-X</sub>C catalyst was influenced by different pyrolysis temperatures (500 to 800 °C) due to the formation of abundant electrochemical active sites. [28,29] The different heat treatment can increase the electrochemical surface area and electrical conductivity. The optimum temperature (600 °C) can increase the conductivity of carbon material (DEI), oxygen vacancy (Vo) and form Fe-N<sub>4-x</sub> centers with lower pyridinic  $N_{2-X}$  content which are reported as active sites.[30] Thus, the trade-off between nitrogen content, Vo and fast electron transport depend upon the reaction temperature (500 to  $800\,^{\circ}\text{C}$ ). The pyrolysis temperature  $600\,^{\circ}\text{C}$  for synthesising electrocatalyst may be more appropriate temperature for excellent OER/ORR multiple performances instead of nitrogen content loss and oxygen vacancy (Vo) in carbon framework.

The as-synthesized magnetite spinel oxide  $Fe_3O_4/N_{2-X}C$ electrocatalyst have been validated by XRD analysis (JCPDS no. 01-074-0748) (Figure 1). The electrocatalysts,  $Fe_3O_4/N_{2-X}C$ -500,  $Fe_3O_4/N_{2-x}C$ -600,  $Fe_3O_4/N_{2-x}C$ -700 and  $Fe_3O_4/N_{2-x}C$ -800 exhibit cubic structure with crystal planes of (111), (220), (311), (222), (400), (422), (333), (440), (620), (533), (622) and (444) having lattice parameter value of a = 8.3940. In addition, absence of diffraction peak at 20° to 30° reveal that spinel oxides (Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> NPs) were effectively decorated on  $N_{2-x^-}$  doped carbon surface and suppressing stacking of N<sub>2-X</sub>-doped carbon nano layers.<sup>[32]</sup> The marked red circle indicate that weakened intensity in magnetite spinel oxide Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/N<sub>2-x</sub>C samples stems from the moderately distorted crystal arrangement induced by the huge expanse of oxygen vacancy (V<sub>0</sub>). Figure 1 shows the crystalline phases of magnetite Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> with space group of Fd-3 m (ICSD Pattern no. 01-074-0748); The crystallite sizes of Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/NC-500 (33.1 nm),  $Fe_3O_4/N_{2-x}C-600$ (29.5 nm),  $Fe_3O_4/N_{2-X}C-700$ (38.4 nm) and  $Fe_3O_4/N_{2-X}C$ -800 (46.2 nm) have been calculated by Debye-Scherrer equation,  $D_{hkl} = K\lambda / \beta Cos \theta$ ,  $[K = 0.1, \lambda -$ 1.54060 Å,  $\beta$ -FWHM and  $\theta$ -Bragg's angle] and the surface area [S = 6000 / $\rho$  x D, where D – particle size and  $\rho$  – X-ray density] are of 26.7 m<sup>2</sup>/g (Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/N<sub>2-x</sub>C-500), 29.9 m<sup>2</sup>/g (Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/N<sub>2-x</sub>C-600), 23.0 m<sup>2</sup>/g (Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/N<sub>2-x</sub>C-700) and 19.1 m<sup>2</sup>/g (Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/N<sub>2-x</sub>C-800). The histrionic size (29.9 m<sup>2</sup>/g) was found for Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/N<sub>2-x</sub>C-600 °C related to other catalyst because spinel oxide have intercontact (particle to particle) on  $N_{2-X}$ -doped carbon surface increase high electron conductivity and huge number of catalytic active sites, which can be further confirmed by XPS.<sup>[33]</sup>

The SEM image of Fe $_3$ O $_4$ /N $_2$ \_xC-500, Fe $_3$ O $_4$ /N $_2$ \_xC-600, Fe $_3$ O $_4$ /N $_2$ \_xC-700 and Fe $_3$ O $_4$ /N $_2$ \_xC-800 (Figure 2) shows that spinel oxide (Fe $_3$ O $_4$  NPs) distributed evenly both side on pyridinic N $_2$ \_xC surface with an average particle size of  $\sim$ 55 nm,  $\sim$ 37 nm,  $\sim$ 113 nm and  $\sim$ 164 nm, respectively (Figure S1). In the case of Fe $_3$ O $_4$ /N $_2$ \_xC-700 and Fe $_3$ O $_4$ /N $_2$ \_xC-800, the larger particle size was detected because the particle growth may take place freely at high temperature. The spinel oxide efficient distributed on N $_2$ \_xC surface with strong particle to

particle interconnection between magnetite spinel oxide and  $N_{2-x}$ -doped carbon nano layer. The robust geometric confinement with lower electrical resistance of metal spinel oxides within  $N_{2-x}C$  nano layers enhanced their interface exchange, aggregation and the dissolution of NPs was suppressed, which leads to stimulating the catalytic activity as well as long term stability towards OER/ORR. [34]

Furthermore, the morphology of crystalline pyridinic  $N_{2-x}$ -doped carbon decorated on spinel oxide electrocatalysts was analyzed by transmission electron microscopy (Figure 3). The typical TEM images shows that spinel  $Fe_3O_4$  nanoparticles have been well spread and consistently contact by thin  $N_{2-x}$ -doped carbon layer in  $Fe_3O_4/N_{2-x}C$ -600 electrocatalyst. The dispersed spinel oxide nanoparticles having the size range of  $\sim$  5-50 nm with average diameter of  $\sim$  25 nm. Also, each spinel  $Fe_3O_4$  nanoparticles interconnected via  $N_{2-x}C$  with several voids. The voids can enhance the interface between the electrolyte and active site of the electrocatalyst during OER/ORR which in turn increase the electrocatalytic activity. [35]

The high-resolution transmission electron microscopic (HRTEM) image (Figure 3) of Fe $_3$ O $_4$ /N $_{2-X}$ C-600 reveal that crystalline spinel Fe $_3$ O $_4$  nanoparticles uniformly contact by multiple N $_{2-X}$ C layers with well-ordered arrangement. The presence of crystalline lattice fringes with d-spacing of 0.2253 nm corresponds to (311) plane of face centered cubic plane based on XRD data. Figure 3c gives an additional evidence for spinel oxide (bulk oxide) growth on N $_{2-X}$ C surface. Obviously, the N $_{2-X}$ -doped carbon in Fe $_3$ O $_4$ /N $_{2-X}$ C play immense role in electron transport during electrochemical reaction. The thickness of spinel oxide nanoparticles on N $_{2-X}$ C layers was  $\approx 5$  nm. The TEM image confirm the crystallinity of Fe $_3$ O $_4$ /N $_{2-X}$ C without atomic defects.

The scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) selected area elemental mapping and lining spectra of  $Fe_3O_4/N_{2-x}C$ -600 show the existence of Fe, O, C and N in  $Fe_3O_4/N_{2-x}C$ -600 (Figure S2).

The chemical composition and valence states of Fe $_3O_4/N_{2-x}$ C-600 have been analyzed by XPS (Figure 4). The survey spectra of Fe $_3O_4/N_{2-x}$ C-600 catalysts show the presence of nitrogen, iron, carbon and oxygen elements (Figure S3). $^{[38-44]}$  The Fe 2p peak is deconvoluted into six peaks at 710.7, 712.9, 718.6, 724.3, 726.9 and 733.7 eV. The binding energy of 710.7 and 712.9 eV corresponds to Fe 2p3/2 confirming Fe $^{2+}$  and Fe $^{3+}$  ion, respectively. The peaks at 724.3 and 726.4 eV can be assigned to Fe 2p1/2, supports Fe $^{2+}$  and Fe $^{3+}$ , respectively. The binding energy of satellite peaks at 718.6 and 733.7 eV indicates the existence of both Fe $^{2+}$  and Fe $^{3+}$  in the electrocatalyst. $^{[32]}$  The higher area peak corresponds to Fe $^{3+}$  than Fe $^{2+}$  implies the higher content of Fe $^{3+}$  because of Fe

(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>.9H<sub>2</sub>O precursor (Figure 4a). For carbon, the C1s spectrum confirm the carbon content and reveal  $N_{2-x}C$  efficiently connected on spinel bulk oxide surface (Figure 4b). The deconvoluted C1s spectra reveal that carbon bonded to both nitrogen as well as oxide groups [C-C, C-O (hydroxyl and epoxy, 284.6 eV), C-N (285.9 eV), C=O (carbonyl, 286.4 eV) and O-C=O (carboxyl, 288.5 eV)]. [45,46] The deconvoluted N1s spectrum show single band at 398.1 eV assigned to pyridinic-N and Fe-N (Figure 4c). [47] Pyridinic-N probably interact with metallic iron and oxide surface may leads to increase the OER/ORR activity. [48,49] The O1s spectra reveal that the binding energy at 531.5 (O<sub>II</sub>) and 529.6 eV (O<sub>I</sub>) attributed to oxygen (nonstoichiometric) or hydroxide species, defected oxygen and surface oxidation of metallic Fe, respectively (Figure 4). The O<sub>II</sub> peaks exceptionally incensed peaks observed. Which strongly shows the existence of oxygen vacancy (Vo) on the electrocatalyst. It is instantly evident from Figure 4 that strong changes in the superficial chemistry happened on Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/N<sub>2-x</sub>C electrocatalsts, suggesting the occurrence of robust electronic exchanges

content in Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/N<sub>2-X</sub>C catalysts was not changed by changing the pyrolysis temperature, whereas the % nitrogen decreased as increasing the temperature from 500 to 800 °C. The Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/ N<sub>2-x</sub>C-500 contains maximum of 5.1% nitrogen which decreased to 1.9% (600°C), 0.54% (700°C) and 0.32% (800°C). Because the nitrogen in the carbon matrix may be released by the conversion of sp<sup>3</sup> to sp<sup>2</sup> hybridization of carbon structure during pyrolysis.[50] Thus, temperature has strong effect on nitrogen content in Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/N<sub>2-x</sub>C-500, Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/N<sub>2-x</sub>C-600, Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/  $N_{2-x}C$ -700 and  $Fe_3O_4/N_{2-x}C$ -800 catalysts and  $Fe_3O_4/N_{2-x}C$ -600 exhibit optimal nitrogen content (1.95%).

#### **Electrochemical Characterization**

The electrocatalytic OER/ORR of all the synthesised catalysts reveal that spinel  $Fe_3O_4/N_{2-x}C$ -600 shows excellent activity along with much higher current density under 0.1 M KOH alkaline condition after acid leaching. [51] It was reported that among the graphitic-N and pyridinic-N fragments, pyridinic-N

was found to be active center for the OER/ORR. [52] Since  $Fe_3O_4/N_{2-x}C$ -600 shows much higher BET surface area than other electrocatalyst, it is expected to show enhanced electrochemical activity (much higher pyridinic-N species) than other catalysts. Therefore, the synergistic effect may promote efficiency of OER/ORR performances by  $Fe_3O_4/N_{2-x}C$ -600 relative to other catalysts.

Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) measurement have been made for Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/N<sub>2-x</sub>C-500,  $Fe_3O_4/N_{2-x}C-600$ ,  $Fe_3O_4/N_{2-x}C-700$  and  $Fe_3O_4/N_{2-x}C-800$  (scan rate  $-10 \text{ mVs}^{-1}$ :  $O_2$  stream &  $N_2$  atmosphere: 0.1 M KOH). Furthermore, the current density have been determined with geometrical surface area of glassy carbon electrode  $(0.071 \text{ cm}^{-2})$ . The CV curve of Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/N<sub>2-x</sub>C-500, Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/N<sub>2-x</sub>C-600,  $Fe_3O_4/N_{2-X}C$ -700 and  $Fe_3O_4/N_{2-X}C$ -800 ( $N_2$  stream: 0.1 M KOH) displays featureless curve whereas in oxygen atmosphere, all catalysts exhibit noticeable well-defined ORR peak (cathodic) in the potential range of 0.8-0.9 V. Whereas the potential range 0.1 V and 0.4 V well defined redox peak related with pseudocapacitive performance of  $N_{2-x}C$  (Figure S5). The catalytic activity of spinel Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/N<sub>2-x</sub>C for ORR was measured by cyclic voltammetry (scan rate: 10 mV s<sup>-1</sup>) using rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE) technique with 0.21 mg cm<sup>-2</sup> catalyst containing electrode. From RDE studies, onset potential at 5 µA for  $Fe_3O_4/N_{2-x}C$  -500,  $Fe_3O_4/N_{2-x}C$  -600,  $Fe_3O_4/N_{2-x}C$  -700 and  $Fe_3O_4/N_{2-x}C$  was calculated as 0.95, 0.95, 0.94 and 0.95 V,

respectively (Figures 5 and S6; Table 1). The ORR behaviour of  $Fe_3O_4/N_{2-\chi}C$  electrocatalyst at low overpotential range relates to an

electrochemical kinetics process (> 0.9 V for alkaline conditions). The ORR  $E_{1/2}$  of  $Fe_3O_4/N_{2-X}C$ -600 become 100, 17 and 88 mV positive shift relative to that of  $Fe_3O_4/N_{2-X}C$ -500,  $Fe_3O_4/N_{2-X}C$ -700 and  $Fe_3O_4/N_{2-X}C$ -800, respectively. Moreover, RDE polarization peak at different rotation exposed an enriched diffusion limited current density (DLC). The K–L plot ( $\omega^{-1/2}$  Vs.

 $J^{-1}$ ) shows perfect linearity for Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/N<sub>2-x</sub>C-500, Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/N<sub>2-x</sub>C-600, Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/N<sub>2-x</sub>C-700 and Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/N<sub>2-x</sub>C-800 electrocatalysts (Figure 5: inset) and ORR electron transfer number have been deduced from K–L plot as 3.1 (Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/N<sub>2-x</sub>C-500), 3.8 (Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/N<sub>2-x</sub>C-600), 3.6 (Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/N<sub>2-x</sub>C-700) and 3.2 (Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/N<sub>2-x</sub>C-800). The observed half-wave potential at 3 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> against RHE are of 0.66 V (Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/N<sub>2-x</sub>C-500), 0.76 V (Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/N<sub>2-x</sub>C-600), 0.75 V (Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/N<sub>2-x</sub>C-700) and 0.68 V(Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/N<sub>2-x</sub>C-800) (Figure 6: Table 1)

The OER polarization curve of  $Fe_3O_4/N_{2-\chi}C$  electrocatalysts have been obtained from LSV (1.1-1.7 V versus RHE: 0.1 M KOH: Scan rate- 10 mV s<sup>-1</sup>: Figure 6). At 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, the

OER potential for  $Fe_3O_4/N_{2-x}C-500$ ,  $Fe_3O_4/N_{2-x}C-600$ ,  $Fe_3O_4/N_{2-x}C-600$ N<sub>2-x</sub>C-700 and Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/N<sub>2-x</sub>C-800 electrocatalysts were determined as 1.61, 1.58, 1.62 and 1.66 V, respectively (Table 1). The ORR/OER electrode potentials were found to be 0.95, 0.82, 0.87 and 0.93 V for Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/N<sub>2-x</sub>C-500, Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/N<sub>2-x</sub>C-600, Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/N<sub>2-x</sub>C-700 and Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/N<sub>2-x</sub>C-800 electrocatalysts, respectively by using the solar to hydrogen fuel device conversion scale (OER at 10 mAcm $^{-2}$  & ORR at 3 mAcm $^{-2}$ ) (Figure 6). [53] The Fe $_3$ O $_4$ /N $_{2-X}$ C-600 electrocatalysts exhibit enhanced activity relative to other catalysts due to the optimum ratio of spinel oxide particle to particle strong contact on  $N_{2-x}C$  layer surface. Furthermore, we concluded that the optimum level and low resistance of bulk oxide and M-N<sub>2-X</sub> may contribute to the electronic movement which enhanced the ORR/OER electrode performances (Figure 6).

The ORR mass activity for Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/N<sub>2-X</sub>C-500, Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/N<sub>2-X</sub>C-600,  $Fe_3O_4/N_{2-x}C$ -700 and  $Fe_3O_4/N_{2-x}C$ -800 electrocatalysts have been calculated at 0.84 V are of 3.88, 5.20, 4.63 and 3.96 mA mg<sup>-1</sup>, respectively (Figure 6). The electrocatalyst Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/  $N_{2-x}C$ -600 exhibit mass activity higher than Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/N<sub>2-x</sub>C-500, Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/N<sub>2-x</sub>C-700 and Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/N<sub>2-x</sub>C-800 electrocatalysts, which strongly indicating that the strong contact between spinel

oxide and  $N_{2-X}C$  surface stimulating the electrochemical reaction. The decreased activity of as prepared electrocatalysts  $(Fe_3O_4/N_{2-X}C-500, Fe_3O_4/N_{2-X}C-700 \text{ and } Fe_3O_4/N_{2-X}C-800) \text{ can}$ be attributed to the inactive bond formation between Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> and  $N_{2-x}C$  leads to particles accumulation and the increased particle size along with small size dispersion of the catalysts results in decrease of efficiency (Figure S1).[54-56] The electrocatalysts prepared at 600 °C showed enhanced activity among the as prepared electrocatalysts and can be attributed to narrow size dispersion and strong-bonding between N<sub>2-X</sub>C and Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>. The OER mass activity for Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/N<sub>2- $\chi$ </sub>C-500, Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/N<sub>2- $\chi$ </sub>C-600,  $Fe_3O_4/N_{2-x}C$ -700 and  $Fe_3O_4/N_{2-x}C$ -800 electrocatalysts are of 17.58, 39.19, 25.87 and 12.45 mA mg<sup>-1</sup>, respectively (1.50 V vs RHE). The deduced ORR/OER Tafel slope are of 78/89 mV/dec  $(Fe_3O_4/N_{2-x}C-500)$ , 73/78 mV/dec  $(Fe_3O_4/N_{2-x}C-600)$ , 76/83 mV/ dec (Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/N<sub>2- $\chi$ </sub>C-700) and 79/98 mV/dec (Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/N<sub>2- $\chi$ </sub>C-800). The Tafel slope for both ORR/OER have been found to be in the order of  $Fe_3O_4/N_{2-X}C$ -500  $< Fe_3O_4/N_{2-X}C$ -600  $< Fe_3O_4/N_{2-X}C$  $700 < \text{Fe}_3\text{O}_4/\text{N}_{2-x}\text{C}-800$ . The effective electrochemical active surface area of Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/N<sub>2-x</sub>C-500, Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/N<sub>2-x</sub>C-600, Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/N<sub>2-x</sub>C-700 and Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/N<sub>2-X</sub>C-800 electrocatalysts were measured from non-faradic region (double layer capacitance) at solid: liquid interface.

The CV of these electrocatalysts were collected in the region of 0.76-1.16 V, where the current response corresponds

to charge of double layer capacity (Figures 7 and S7). The calculated capacitance of Fe $_3$ O $_4$ /N $_2$ \_xC-500, Fe $_3$ O $_4$ /N $_2$ \_xC-600, Fe $_3$ O $_4$ /N $_2$ \_xC-700 and Fe $_3$ O $_4$ /N $_2$ \_xC-800 electrocatalysts are of 4.5, 7.3, 5.6 and 5.2, respectively, which show that Fe $_3$ O $_4$ /N $_2$ \_xC-600 has much higher electrochemical active surface and roughness than Fe $_3$ O $_4$ /N $_2$ \_xC-500, Fe $_3$ O $_4$ /N $_2$ \_xC-700 and Fe $_3$ O $_4$ /N $_2$ \_xC-800 electrocatalysts. Thus, the huge give-and-take current density of Fe $_3$ O $_4$ /N $_2$ \_xC-600 can be accompanying with high active electrochemical surface

area. [57] The Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/N<sub>2-X</sub>C-600 electrocatalyst exhibit lower overpotential and high active surface area compared to Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/  $N_{2-x}C-500$ ,  $Fe_3O_4/N_{2-x}C-700$  and  $Fe_3O_4/N_{2-x}C-800$  electrocatalysts. The lower Tafel slope and high surface area obtained for spinel Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/N<sub>2-x</sub>C-600 electrocatalysts could be the cause for enhanced ORR/OER activity. Previous reports proposed fourelectron transfer mechanism for ORR: [58,59] the spinel Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/ N<sub>2-x</sub>C electrocatalysts reveal lower Tafel slope for ORR and OER at overpotential region of 0.80 to 0.88 V and 1.4 to 1.6 V, respectively which proposes the same electrochemical reaction mechanism for Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/N<sub>2-x</sub>C electrocatalysts. [60,61] The essential active surface property of Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/N<sub>2-X</sub>C-600 shows higher activity compared to Fe $_3O_4/N_{2-X}C$ -500, Fe $_3O_4/N_{2-X}C$ -700 and  $Fe_3O_4/N_{2-X}C$ -800 electrocatalysts (Figure 7). The incomplete oxygen reduction as well as oxygen oxidation for Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/N<sub>2-x</sub>C-500, Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/N<sub>2-x</sub>C-700 and Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/N<sub>2-x</sub>C-800 may accountable for low mass activity. Additionally, Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/N<sub>2-x</sub>C phase does not affect the reaction path but can change the ORR electrocatalytic reaction rate. The ratio of  $N_{2-\chi}C$  content to spinel oxide in Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/N<sub>2-x</sub>C-600 is about optimal ratio, which can afford optimised electron movement for oxygen electrode. Also, Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/N<sub>2-X</sub>C-600 has slightly higher BET surface area than  $Fe_3O_4/N_{2-x}C-500$ ,  $Fe_3O_4/N_{2-x}C-700$  and  $Fe_3O_4/N_{2-x}C-800$  (Table S2). The excellent oxygen electrode potential of 0.82 V (Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/N<sub>2-x</sub>C-600) compared to that of precious electrocatalysts (Pt-Ru/C-0.88 V and 20% Pt/C-1.16 V) and nonprecious electrocatalysts (MnO<sub>2</sub>/NCNT ~ 0.90 V and NiCo<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-0.84 V) confirm the superiority of as synthesised spinel Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/N<sub>2-x</sub>C electrocatalysts. The comparison of oxygen electrode potential of Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/N<sub>2-X</sub>C-500,  $Fe_3O_4/N_{2-X}C$ -600,  $Fe_3O_4/N_{2-X}C$ -700 and  $Fe_3O_4/N_{2-X}C$ -800 with reported nonprecious bifunctional Fe-Nx/C/L58SCF electrocatalyst are shown in Table 1.[62-64] From K-L plot, the calculated ORR J<sub>k</sub> (kinetic current density) of Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/N<sub>2-x</sub>C-600 (8.2 mAcm<sup>-2</sup>) have been comparable with precious catalysts 20% Pt/C (7.8 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>) (Figure S8), which is among the greatest ever reported precious as well as nonprecious electrocatalysts. Table S3 shows the excellent activity of as synthesised electrocatalysts along with other reported catalysts. [65-68]

The ORR  $E_{1/2}$  potential of  $Fe_3O_4/N_{2-x}C$ -600 (0.76 V) catalyst was 20 and 150 mV higher than Pt–Ru/C (0.74 V) and higher than  $IrO_2$  (0.61 V), respectively. The OER current density 10 mAcm<sup>-2</sup> of  $Fe_3O_4/N_{2-x}C$ -600 was higher than  $IrO_2$  and GC however,  $E_{1/2}$  of  $Fe_3O_4/N_{2-x}C$ -600 was 100 mV lower than Pt/C (0.86 V). Though ORR performance was slightly lower than Pt/C electrocatalyst,  $Fe_3O_4/N_{2-x}C$ -600 exhibit several advantages in terms of cost, stability, durability and earth abundance (Figure S9). The mixture of precious electrocatalysts (Pt–Ru/C and

IrO<sub>2</sub>) demonstrated skewed ORR RDE traces with troubled diffusion-limited current owing to catalysts environment, which indicates lower ORR activity of these electrocatalysts. <sup>[69]</sup>

The oxygen electrode durability and stability have been analysed for both ORR and OER to understand the efficiency of spinel oxide strongly interconnected on  $N_{2-x}C$  surface. The durability of  $Fe_3O_4/N_{2-x}C$  for ORR was examined by carrying out repeated potentio-dynamic cycling (5000 cycles) with potential range of 0.2–1.0 V (scan rate  $-10~\text{mVs}^{-1}$ :  $O_2$  atmosphere: 0.1 M KOH). After 2000 and 5000 cycles,  $E_{1/2}$  of  $Fe_3O_4/N_{2-x}C$ -600 exposed half wave potential loss about 20 and 50 mV, respectively (Figure S9). The slow fall off performance of  $Fe_3O_4/N_{2-x}C$ -600 electrocatalyst can be attributed to carbon corrosion or deactivated N active site in  $N_{2-x}C$  lattice and rust layers, which is the main ORR electrochemical active site. $^{[70-72]}$

Moreover, OER electrode stability was evaluated by repeated LSV measurement (1.1-1.8 V vs RHE:  $O_2$  stream: 0.1 M KOH) and observed the overpotential variation at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> (Figure S9). The OER overpotential for new, 500<sup>th</sup> and 1000<sup>th</sup> cycle was found to be 1.58, 1.59, and 1.60 V, respectively, implying very slight potential loss until 1000<sup>th</sup> cycle. The observed result reveal that Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/N<sub>2-X</sub>C-600 surface was sustained during potential stability cycling test. During OER cycling test, evolution of huge quantity of  $O_2$  from the electrode surface results in peel off electrocatalyst layer from glassy carbon surface and leads to lower the stability.

The methanol crossover and stability of the electrocatalysts are significant factors for estimation of real scale up fuel cell applications. The methanol oxidation evaluated by J-t response potential at 0.85 V vs. RHE under low alkaline (O<sub>2</sub>-saturated, 0.1 M KOH) conditions. The ORR current density of Pt/C harshly drops after the adding of methanol (3.0 M), which can be ascribed to methanol oxidation reaction instead of oxygen reduction reaction by Pt/C under the experimental current conditions (Figure S10a). The spinel Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/N<sub>2-x</sub>C-600 electrocatalyst slight current decrease, which demonstrating

that spinel Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/N<sub>2-x</sub>C-600 electrocatalst shows methanol tolerance peerless with Pt/C.[74] Whereas, the Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/N<sub>2-x</sub>C-600 electrocatalyst also reveals outstanding long term constancy compared to precious Pt/C electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction reaction under low alkaline medium (0.1 M KOH) conditions (Figure S10b). Furthermore, Nyquist plots at OCV potentials demonstrate that the Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/N<sub>2-x</sub>C-600 electrocatalyst has the lowest charge-transfer resistance (Figure S11), as seen by the small size of the semicircle in the frequency range, indicating a fast charge-transfer capability.<sup>[75]</sup> Thus, based on our results, the DEI triggered by the synergistic effect of V<sub>o</sub> (oxygen vacancy) spinel oxide reveals thoughtful impacts on ORR/OER activity by actually (i) High electrical conductivity, (ii) Offer a huge active superficial area, which assists diffusion of energetic species and rushes subsequent external electrochemical reactions plentiful the ORR/OER active hub numbers and (iii) Offer smooth pathways to facilitate permeation of the electrolyte and interaction of reactants energetic sites surface. The excellent ORR/OER performance of the Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/N<sub>2</sub>-XC-600 electrocatalysts enables it to outstanding among other electrocatalysts (Table 1), and better than the benchmark ORR/OER electrocatalysts, Pt/C, RuO<sub>2</sub> and IrO<sub>2</sub> (Figures S8 and Table S3). The boost of bulk oxide electrocatalyst and electrode stability is under study in our material science lab and the excellent results will be conveyed in our forthcoming communication.

## 4. Conclusion

A highly efficient double-exchange interaction (DEI) spinel oxide strong contact on N<sub>2-x</sub>C boost electrocatalysts of Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/  $N_{2-x}C-500$ ,  $Fe_3O_4/N_{2-x}C-600$ ,  $Fe_3O_4/N_{2-x}C-700$  and  $Fe_3O_4/N_{2-x}C-700$ 800 for ORR/OER was developed by solid-state thermolysis processes at different pyrolysis temperatures. The co-existence of oxygen vacancy (Vo) facilitated nanoheterojunction is an crucial to prompt the double-exchange interaction (DEI) between Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> and N<sub>2-x</sub>C. XRD, XPS, SEM and HRTEM micrograph of these electrocatalysts supports the incorporation of N<sub>2-x</sub>-doped carbon bonding on spinel oxide surface. From K–L plot, ORR electron transfer numbers have been calculated as 3.1 (Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/ $N_{2-x}$ C-500), 3.8 (Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/ $N_{2-x}$ C-600), 3.6 (Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/ $N_{2-x}$ C-700) and 3.2 (Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/N<sub>2-x</sub>C-800).

600 electrocatalysts could be the reason for enhanced ORR/ OER activity. The as-prepared spinel  $Fe_3O_4/N_{2-X}C$  electrocatalysts become alternative electrocatalyst to Pt/C electrocatalyst in air batteries and PEM Fuel Cells in view of high performance and stability.

## **Experimental Section**

#### Materials

Nafion (5 wt%), Fe(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>.9H<sub>2</sub>O, RuO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>2</sub>N<sub>2</sub> were obtained from Sigma Aldrich and Pt/C (20 wt%) was obtained from Alfa aesar. All other chemicals were of analytical grade purchased from Shanghai Lingfeng Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd and used as received without further purification. Ultrapure water (18 M $\Omega$ cm) was used for all experiments.

# Synthesis of high conducting spinel oxide decorated $N_{2-x}C$ electrocatalyst (Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/N<sub>2-x</sub>C).

Fe(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>.9H<sub>2</sub>O (1.1 g) and CH<sub>2</sub>N<sub>2</sub> (cyanamide) (2.2 g) in ultrapure water (10 mL) were stirred at 80  $^{\circ}$ C until all the water was evaporated. Then, the dried solid was ground well and loaded into a Swagelok union cell. The cell was heated to 500, 600, 700 and 800  $^{\circ}$ C for 3 h at a heating rate of 5  $^{\circ}$ C/min, after cooling, the Swagelok cell was carefully opened and the material was collected for characterization. The electrocatalysts prepared at different temperatures of 500, 600, 700 and 800  $^{\circ}$ C were denoted as Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/NC-500, Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/NC-600, Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/NC-700 and Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/NC-800. The inactive iron oxide species are removed from the heat-treated sample through pre-leach with 3 N HCl for 1 h, followed by washing with DIW and ethanol.

#### Characterization

The SEM and TEM of all the synthesized materials were recorded with Hitachi S-4700 scanning electron microscope (SEM) operated at an accelerating voltage of 10 kV and with an EM 912 omega transmission electron microscope (TEM) operated at 120 kV, respectively. X-ray diffraction (XRD) data were acquired by a Rigaku Smartlab diffractometer with Cu K $\alpha$  radiation (1.5406 Å) operated at 40 kV and 40 mA. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was conducted to analyze surface elemental composition of all materials using ESCALAB-250 spectrometer with monochromated Al K $\alpha$  (150 W) source. The nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms were measured at -196 °C using Micromeritics ASAP 2020 accelerated surface area and porosimetry system. The specific surface area was determined with Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method from nitrogen adsorption data at a relative pressure range between 0.05 and 0.2. The total pore volume was determined from the amount of gas adsorbed at the relative pressure of 0.99. Pore size distribution (PSD) was derived from adsorption branches by Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method.

#### Electrode preparation and electrochemical characterization

The working electrode was polished with 0.3  $\mu$ m alumina slurry to obtain mirror like surface, then rinsed with ultra pure water and acetone for several times and dried under nitrogen stream. The catalyst slurry was prepared by mixing 4.0 mg catalyst with 1.0 mL of Nafion (5 wt%) and water in v/v ratio of 1/9 for 20 min in an ultrasonicator. The slurry was placed on freshly polished working

electrode and the electrode was allowed to dry at room temperature before measurement. For comparison, 1.0 mg/mL of commercial IrO<sub>2</sub> suspension was fabricated on the electrode using the same procedure. This lead to a catalyst loading of 0.5 µgcm<sup>-2</sup> for all catalysts as well as commercial IrO2 and were used directly as working electrode without further treatment. All electrochemical measurements were carried out with Biologic VMP3 electrochemical workstation. OER activities of the electrodes were characterized by OER polarization curves, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and chronoamperometry. Electrochemical studies of the samples were carried out at room temperature using threeelectrode geometry. A glassy carbon was used as working electrode, Pt wire and Ag/AgCl saturated with KCl were used as counter and reference electrodes, respectively. The OER activity was evaluated by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) with scan rate of 10 mV s<sup>-1</sup>. The impedance of each catalyst was measured by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy over a frequency range of 100 kHz to 10 mHz with sinusoidal perturbation amplitude of 5 mV. The potential measured against Ag/AgCl electrode was converted to the potential versus RHE (reversible hydrogen electrode) according to the equation,  $E_{RHF} = E_{A\alpha/A\alpha Cl} + 0.197 + 0.0591$  pH. All electrochemical data were obtained after repeated cycling of about 20 times for ORR and OER. The TOF of the electrocatalyst was calculated at a potential of 1.6 V versus RHE using the formula:

 $TOF = [J (mA cm^{-2}) \times molecular weight (gmol)/[4 \times F \times catalyst loading (mg cm^{-2})], where, J- current density and F- Faraday constant.$ 

#### **ORR** measurements

The cyclic voltammogram experiments were conducted in an  $O_2$  saturated 0.1 M KOH solution for ORR with scan rate of 50 mV s<sup>-1</sup> at room temperature. The linear sweep voltammogram were obtained in the  $O_2$  saturated 0.1 M KOH solution at rotation speed varying from 500 to 2500 rpm with scan rate of 10 mV s<sup>-1</sup>. The stability tests were performed in  $O_2$  saturated 0.1 M KOH at room temperature before and after 3000 cycles at sweep rate of 100 mV s<sup>-1</sup>. At the end of the cycles, the resulting electrodes were used for polarization curves at sweep rate of 10 mV s<sup>-1</sup>. The number of electrons (n) involved in the ORR can be calculated from Koutecky-Levich (K–L) equation:

$$1/J = 1/J_{L} + 1/J_{K} = 1/B\omega^{1/2} + 1/J_{K}$$
 (1)

$$B = 0.62n FAv^{-1/6}C_o(D_o)^{2/3}$$
 (2)

where, j-measured current density,  $J_L$  and  $J_K$ -diffusion- and kinetic-limiting current densities, respectively. B-Levich slope, n-number of electrons transferred for ORR,  $\varpi$ -rotation speed in rpm, F-faraday constant (96485 C mol  $^{-1}$ ), 0.62-constant, n-kinetic viscosity (0.01 cm  $^2$  s  $^{-1}$ ), D $_0$ -diffusion coefficient of O $_2$  in 0.1 M KOH (1.9 ×  $10^{-5}$  cm  $^2$  s  $^{-1}$ ) and C $_0$ -bulk concentration of (1.2 ×  $10^{-6}$  mol cm  $^{-3}$ ).

#### **OER** measurement

OER tests were conducted in  $O_2$  saturated 0.1 M KOH electrolyte with scan rate of 10 mV s $^{-1}$  at room temperature and the potential range was from 1.0 to 1.9 V. The data were corrected devoid of i-R correction and the durability test was evaluated by chronoamperometry test at 1.62 V.

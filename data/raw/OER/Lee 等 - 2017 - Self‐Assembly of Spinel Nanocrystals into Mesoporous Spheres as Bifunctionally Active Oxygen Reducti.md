**Abstract:** The present work introduces spinel oxide nano-crystals self-assembled into mesoporous spheres that are bi-functionally active towards catalyzing both oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The electrochemical evaluation reveals that (Ni,Co)3O<sup>4</sup> demonstrates significantly positive shifted ORR on-set and half-wave potentials (-0.127 and -0.292 V vs. SCE, respectively), while Co3O<sup>4</sup> results in a negative shifted OER potential (0.65 V vs. SCE) measured at 10 mA cm-2 . Based on the DFT analysis, the potential at which all oxygen intermediate reactions proceed spontaneously is the highest for (Ni,Co)3O<sup>4</sup> (U = 0.66 eV) during ORR, while it is the lowest for Co3O<sup>4</sup> (U = 2.09 eV) during OER. The high ORR activity of (Ni,Co)3O<sup>4</sup> is attributed to the enhanced electrical conductivity of the spinel lattice, while the high OER activity of Co3O<sup>4</sup> is attributed to relatively weak adsorption energy promoting rapid release of evolved oxygen.

### **Introduction**

Soaring energy demands during the past few decades have led to continued burning of fossil fuels, producing greenhouse gases that contribute to increasing global warming. To address the energy demands and reduce carbon emissions, advance energy storage conversion and storage systems that produce energy in a clean and sustained route have recently been investigated by many researchers. Rechargeable metal-air batteries are considered one of the most promising future generation energy systems due to their extremely high energy density and flat discharge potentials.[\[1\]](#page-9-0) These advantages of rechargeable metalair batteries make them particularly interesting for applications in electric drive vehicles for improving insufficient driving range, as well as in electrical energy storage (EES) systems for coupling intermittent renewable wind and solar energy sources into smart energy-grids.

Rechargeable metal-air batteries, however, require active bifunctional electrocatalysts to accelerate the kinetics of intrinsically sluggish oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which are the fundamental electrochemical reactions that govern the discharge and charge processes, respectively.[\[2\]](#page-9-1) For the development of practically viable rechargeable metal-air batteries, bi-functional electrocatalysts residing in the air electrode must be sufficiently catalytically active towards both ORR and OER.[\[3\]](#page-9-2) Currently, the state-of-the-art catalyst, platinum on carbon (Pt/C) demonstrates the ORR highest activity. However, it is very costly due to its scarcity, and is only mono-functionally active towards ORR, making it unsuitable for the production of cost-competitive rechargeable metal-air batteries.[\[4\]](#page-9-3) For instance, primary (non-rechargeable) zinc-air batteries are the only type of metal-air battery that is currently available in the market for niche applications such as hearing-aids, and it utilizes inexpensive earth-abundant Mnbased catalysts. Despite its affordability and excellent discharge characteristics, primary zinc-air batteries cannot be recharged efficiently due to insufficient OER activity (charge performance) of the catalyst.

Recently, numerous non-precious bi-functional catalyst developments have been reported in the literature including transition metal oxides[\[5\]](#page-9-4) , nanostructured carbons[\[6\]](#page-9-5) , and hybrid catalysts[\[7\]](#page-9-6) . For example, a novel metal-free transition metal oxide such as mesoporous Co3O<sup>4</sup> synthesized by silica templating method has been shown to be highly active and durable as a bifunctional catalyst, demonstrating a comparable total overpotential of 1.034 V and superior methanol-tolerance than noble-metal counterparts.[\[5a\]](#page-9-4) Nanostructured carbon based catalysts have also been developed, Tian et al. reporting coaxial nanocables with surface nitrogen groups that are capable of catalyzing both ORR and OER with significantly reduced overpotentials for both oxygen reactions.[\[6a\]](#page-9-5) Recently, hybrid catalysts composed of non-precious metal oxide and nanocarbons have received a tremendous attention due to their improved catalytic activity through synergistic enhancements between the two components. Notably, Co3O<sup>4</sup> nanocrystals decorated nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes have been shown to be bi-functionally very effective for rechargeable zinc-air batteries, demonstrating stable charge and discharge voltages over a total of 100 hours without any voltage degradation.[\[8\]](#page-9-7)

Despite these efforts, much work is still needed for non-precious bi-functional catalyst developments to understand the exact reaction mechanisms and degradation pathways of mixed spinel oxides, such as NiCo2O4, MnCo2O4, FeCo2O4. Specifically, the work presented here utilizes both experimental and first-principles density functional theory (DFT) computational approaches to investigate the bi-functional electrocatalytic behaviors of spinel structured oxides of varying compositions, including Co3O4, (Ni,Co)3O4, and (Mn,Co)3O4. These spinel oxides fabricated by a facile solvothermal technique demonstrates self-assembled mesoporous spherical morphology with varying degrees of catalytic activities towards both ORR and OER depending on the type of transition metals (Co, Ni, and Mn) inserted into the octahedral sites of the spinel lattice. The first-principles DFT computational method has been employed to find the potentials at which all oxygen intermediate steps proceed spontaneously, to verify the experimentally obtained electrochemical results. The outcomes of this study opens the door for designing affordable non-precious bi-functional catalysts with tailored ORR and OER activities depending on the modification of the composition of spinel metal oxides for rechargeable metal-air battery applications.

### **Results and Discussion**

The mesoporous spheres have been synthesized by a facile solvothermal technique using ammonium bicarbonate as precipitation and pore-forming agent to promote the formation of metal carbonate nanocrystals self-assembled into spherical structures (Figure 1a). The heat treatment process in the presence of oxygen (in air) thermally decomposes metal carbonates into metal oxide spheres, releasing CO<sup>2</sup> gas and leaving pores behind[\[9\]](#page-9-8) as shown by the following equation:

3*M*-CO<sup>3</sup> + 1/2O<sup>2</sup> *M*3O<sup>4</sup> + CO<sup>2</sup> (1)

where *M* is one or more transition metals used in this study (Co, or Ni and Co, or Mn and Co). The release of CO<sup>2</sup> gas within the spherical metal oxide phase leaving behind pores is very interesting for enhanced electrocatalysis as it increases the active surface area and facilitates mass transport. The three kinds of porous spinel oxide synthesized in this study, Co3O4, (Ni,Co)3O4, and (Mn,Co)3O<sup>4</sup> analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) have been to reveal their porous spherical morphology (Figure 1b-d). Without the addition of ammonium bicarbonate, randomly oriented sheet-like metal oxide structures of varying sizes have been observed (Figure S1). Further inspection of higher magnification SEM images of the sphere oxides has revealed nano-sized crystals that self-assembled into a few micron scale spherical structures (Figure 1e-g). Interestingly, despite using the same amounts of reagents during the synthesis, including the total amount of transition metal precursors, slightly different sizes of nano-crystals have been observed, due to changes in the crystal lattice structure with the insertion of Ni and Mn into Co3O4. For bi-functional catalysis, high surface area materials are much desirable since ORR and OER are interfacial reactions that occur on the active catalyst's surface.[\[10\]](#page-9-9) The surface area of the metal oxides has been measured by conducting Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis, resulting in very high specific surface areas of 132, 66.3, and 162 m<sup>2</sup> g -1 obtained with Co3O4, (Ni,Co)3O4, and (Mn,Co)3O4, respectively. (Figure S2). The nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms show a hysteresis loop in the region of high relative pressure (Type IV isotherm) due to the presence of mesopores formed by the interparticle spacing between nano-crystals. Based on the pore size distribution obtained by Barrette-Joynere-Halenda (BJH) analysis, the peak pore diameter has been found to be 3.6, 12, and 3.5 nm obtained with Co3O4, (Ni,Co)3O4, and (Mn,Co)3O4, respectively, which likely corresponds to the size of the interparticle spacing. This mesoporous nature of the sphere is highly beneficial for both ORR and OER since greater specific surface area increases the number of active sites exposed, and the pores can also act as channels to facilitate rapid mass transport of reactants and products during the catalytic reactions. The spinel oxide spheres analyzed by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) prior to the thermal decomposition of ammonium bicarbonate has resulted in patterns that closely matched with metal carbonates (PDF #11-0692) (Figure 1h). After the heat treatment and the release of CO2, the XRD patterns of the spheres have been found to match very closely with the typical cubic spinel crystal structure (PDF #74-2120) (Figure 1i). Interestingly, the peak positions of Ni and Mn have shifted to smaller angles relative to those of Co3O4, due to the substitution of Co ions in the native spinel crystal structure with Ni and Mn ions having different ionic radii. As a result, both the *d*-spacing (the

analysis, Raman spectroscopy has been conducted to confirm the spinel crystal structure, which showed typical F2g, Eg, and A1g vibrational modes of Co3O<sup>4</sup> (Figure 1j).[\[12\]](#page-9-11) However, these vibrational modes broadened with (Ni,Co)3O4, and (Mn,Co)3O<sup>4</sup> as a result of less coherent vibrations in mixed transition metal oxides. To verify the composition of the spinel oxide spheres, XPS has been conducted which confirmed the presence of Co 2p with

all three spinel oxide spheres in addition to Ni and Mn detected with (Ni,Co)3O4, and (Mn,Co)3O4, respectively, based on the XPS survey (Figure 2a). Further XPS analysis of these oxides has revealed that the chemical composition at the surface of the catalysts is Ni1.4Co1.6O4, and Mn1.4Co1.6O4. This suggests the transition metal cations occupy both the tetrahedral and octahedral sites. Specifically, de-convoluting the high-resolution

Co 2p spectrum of Co3O<sup>4</sup> (777-811 eV) (Figure 2b) has revealed splitting of the peak into 2p1/2 (795.0 eV) and 2p3/2 (779.8 eV) doublet due to the presence of cobalt cations having different oxidation states in either the tetrahedral (CoII) or octahedral (CoIII) interstitial sites of the spinel lattice.[\[13\]](#page-9-12) Similarly, the de-convoluted Co 2p and Ni 2p (850-890 eV) of (Ni,Co)3O<sup>4</sup> (Figure 2c, and d, respectively), and Co 2p and Mn 2p (637-661 eV) of (Mn,Co)3O<sup>4</sup>

(Figure 2e, and f, respectively) have shown peak splitting, confirming the presence of both MII and MIII oxidation states of the active transition metal centers. The observation of multiple oxidation states of Co is particularly important for bi-functional catalysis since CoII and CoIII are usually considered as the active site for ORR and OER, respectively.[\[7c,](#page-9-13) [14\]](#page-9-14) The de-convolution of O 1s spectrum (528-535 eV) obtained with all three spherical

oxides has shown three peaks that corresponded to oxygen in the spinel lattice, adsorbed -OH and H2O, and surface CoIII (Figure S3), most likely due to the leftover from the thermal decomposition. The peak splitting of the active transition metal centers (Co, Ni, and Mn) observed with all three oxides is important, particularly for bi-functional oxygen catalysis since the multivalent nature of the metal centers in the spinel structure has been consistently reported to allows rapid charge transfer through electron hopping,

as well as improved interaction with oxygen intermediates during the oxygen reactions.[\[13\]](#page-9-12) Having characterized the physical properties of the spinel oxide spheres, their electrochemical activities towards bi-functional ORR and OER have been evaluated by half-cell rotating disk electrode (RDE) voltammetry at various rotation speeds (Figure S4). Based on the ORR polarization curves obtained at 1,600 rpm in O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH (Figure 3a), (Ni,Co)3O<sup>4</sup> is observed to be significantly

positive shifted, indicative of superior ORR activity, followed by Co3O<sup>4</sup> and (Mn,Co)3O4. In particular, (Ni,Co)3O<sup>4</sup> demonstrates relatively much positive on-set potential (-0.127 V vs. SCE) compared to those of Co3O4, and (Mn,Co)3O<sup>4</sup> (-0.171, and -0.217 V, respectively). This signifies a lower activation energy required for (Ni,Co)3O<sup>4</sup> to overcome the barrier of the first electron reaction which is usual known as the rate-limiting step. The same trend is observed with half-wave potentials (E1/2), (Ni,Co)3O<sup>4</sup> demonstrating most positively shifted E1/2 of -0.292 V compared to -0.355 and -0.378 V obtained with Co3O<sup>4</sup> and (Mn,Co)3O4, respectively (Figure 3b). Further investigation by Tafel analysis reveals that the three oxides results in comparable slopes in the range of 90 to 94 mV/decade (Figure 3c), which suggests that the ORR on these catalysts proceed at similar rates of kinetics even though the energy requirements for overcoming the first electron reaction are different. As such, introducing active metal substituents (Ni, Mn) into the pristine Co3O<sup>4</sup> spinel lattice affects mostly the degree of binding with oxygen and the formation of first reduced oxygen species[\[15\]](#page-9-15) , while the rest of the intermediate reactions proceed at similar kinetic rates. In addition to the ORR activity, the OER activity of the spinel oxides has been evaluated, resulting in (Ni,Co)3O4, and Co3O<sup>4</sup> with very similar on-set potentials (~0.60 V), and (Mn,Co)3O<sup>4</sup> with a more positive shifted (less active) on-set potential (0.65 V) (Figure 3d). Despite demonstrating similar on-set potentials, Co3O<sup>4</sup> has resulted in a slightly more negative (more active) OER potential (EOER) of 0.646 V measured at 10 mA cm-2 compared to those of (Ni,Co)3O4, and (Mn,Co)3O<sup>4</sup> (0.671 and 0.712 V) (Figure 3e). The OER Tafel analysis of Co3O<sup>4</sup> has resulted in the lowest slope of 64 mV/decade, followed by 81 and 78 mV/decade obtained with (Ni,Co)3O4, and (Mn,Co)3O4, respectively (Figure 3f), indicative of more rapid OER kinetics of Co3O<sup>4</sup> despite demonstrating similar on-set potential as (Ni,Co)3O4. For both ORR and OER, relatively lower activity and kinetics observed with (Mn,Co)3O<sup>4</sup> is most likely

**Figure 5.** Comparisons of (a) ORR half-wave potentials, and (b) OER potentials measured at10 mA cm-2 obtained experimentally with Gibbs free energies obtained from DFT computational analysis of Co3O4, (Ni,Co)3O4, and (Mn,Co)3O4.

due to its least favorable interaction with oxygen intermediates as a result of lattice expansion and broadened vibrational modes observed by XRD and Raman analyses, respectively. The differences in the ORR and OER activities of the metal oxides also suggests that they are clearly dependent on the type of transition metal substituent inserted into the spinel oxide structure. To confirm this, double layer capacitance has been measured as the slope of current versus scan rate plot obtained by conducting CV at various scan rates in a potential window where no Faradaic redox occurs (Figure S5). The double layer capacitance has been reported to be linearly proportional to the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) of metal oxides.[\[16\]](#page-9-16) Interestingly, the measured capacitance values of 2.9, 2.6, and 4.4 mF cm-2 obtained with Co3O4, (Ni,Co)3O4, and (Mn,Co)3O4, respectively, show the same trend as the BET surface area results ((Ni,Co)3O<sup>4</sup> < Co3O<sup>4</sup> < (Mn,Co)3O4), confirming the validity of the surface areas measured in this study. The differences in the surface area of the metal oxides however are found to have less dominant effect on the catalytic activity towards ORR and OER compared to the compositional effect demonstrated by introducing Ni and Mn transition metal substiuents into the spinel oxide structure. This leads to (Ni,Co)3O<sup>4</sup> demonstraing the least potential difference between ORR and OER despite exhibiting the smallest BET surface area and double layer capacitance. Specifically, (Ni,Co)3O<sup>4</sup> demonstrates the best overall bi-functional catalytic activity with the least potential difference (ΔEOER-ORR = 1.01 V) between the ORR and OER potentials measured at the current densities -3 mA cm-2 and 10 mA cm-2 , respectively (Table S1). Based on the literature survey, the ORR/OER potential difference is found to be smaller in comparison to many reports, and even comparable to some of the best published results on non-precious transition metal oxide based bi-functional catalysts. The activity enhancement is attributed to the insertion of Ni cations into the octahedral sites of the spinel lattice, which has been reported to improve the electrical conductivity of the spinel oxide.[\[17\]](#page-9-17) On the other hand, the catalytic activity of Co3O<sup>4</sup> largely favors OER, leading to reduced OER overpotential and the generation of high current densities. This is attributed to relatively weak adsorption energy between oxygen adsorbate and the surface of active Co cations, promoting release of oxygen during OER.[\[18\]](#page-9-18) This in reverse reduces the ORR activity due to the weak binding and insufficient energy to activate adsorbed oxygen. The high bifunctional catalytic activities of the spinel oxide spheres, in comparison to commercially available Co3O<sup>4</sup> nanoparticle catalyst, have been highlighted by much improved ORR (positive shifted) and OER (negative shifted) potentials (Figure S6). However, in comparison to a mixture of precious metal Pt/C + Ir/C benchmark catalyst, the spinel oxide spheres have demonstrated relatively weaker bi-functional activities. This sacrificed activity is currently the main trade-off of utilizing inexpensive non-precious transition metal based catalysts as opposed to the precious ones, and can be minimized by hybridizing with nanostructured active carbon to synergistically improve both ORR and OER performances.

To provide further insight into the bi-functional electrochemical behaviors of the spinel oxides, the first-principles DFT calculations has been conducted by modeling their cubic Fd3m space group lattice in a periodic two-layer slabs with a (2x2) unit cell (Figure S7). In the spinel lattices of (Ni,Co)3O<sup>4</sup> and (Mn,Co)3O4, Ni and Mn ions are known to preferentially occupy the octahedral interstitials sites, whereas Co ions are distributed over both octahedral and tetrahedral sites. Therefore, (Ni,Co)3O<sup>4</sup> and (Mn,Co)3O4have been modeled by exchanging half of the octahedral Co ions with Ni or Mn in Co3O4[9]. During ORR and OER, the metal oxide surfaces undergo changes due to the interaction with different oxygen intermediates (i.e. \*OOH, \*O, and \*OH) (Figure 4a, b, and c, respectively). The band diagram shows the changes in the Gibbs free energy (ΔG) of the spinel oxides during interactions with each of these intermediates at zero potential (U = 0 V), equilibrium potential (U = 1.23 V), and the potential at which all oxygen intermediates proceed spontaneously (Figure 4d-f). Based on this band energy calculations, the limiting thermodynamic potential where all steps proceed downward has been found to be U = 0.14 and 0.66 V with Co3O<sup>4</sup> and (Ni,Co)3O4, respectively. However, with (Mn,Co)3O4, the energy of the intermediate reaction corresponding to the reduction of OH\* to OH- has remained slightly thermodynamically upward even at U = 0 V. These calculations then predict the degree of the ORR activity of the spinel oxides to be in the order

of (Mn,Co)3O<sup>4</sup> < Co3O<sup>4</sup> < (Ni,Co)3O4, which parallels the activity trend observed experimentally (Figure 5a). Specifically, (Ni,Co)3O<sup>4</sup> having demonstrated the highest U potential has shown the most positively shifted on-set and half-wave ORR potentials, while a lower U potential of Co3O<sup>4</sup> matched with relatively negative shifted ORR potentials. Lastly, the lowest U potential obtained with (Mn,Co)3O<sup>4</sup> matched with further negative shifted ORR potentials obtained experimentally. To predict the OER activities of the spinel oxides, potentials greater than 1.23 V have been applied to find the point at which all free energies associated with OER intermediate reactions proceeded spontaneously, resulting in U = 2.09, 2.26 and 2.93 V obtained with Co3O4, (Ni,Co)3O4, and (Mn,Co)3O4, respectively. The lowest U potential of Co3O<sup>4</sup> is an indication that it exhibits superior OER activity followed by (Ni,Co)3O<sup>4</sup> and (Mn,Co)3O4. These DFT predictions are also in good agreement with the OER potentials obtained experimentally at 10 mA cm-2 (Figure 5b). Despite relatively smaller activity difference (as well as U potential difference), Co3O<sup>4</sup> outperforming (Ni,Co)3O<sup>4</sup> suggests that the adsorption strength between oxygen intermediates and active metal cations has a greater effect on the overall OER activity than the electrical conductivity enhancement. As OER is a reverse reaction of ORR, Co3O<sup>4</sup> which demonstrated a lower ORR activity due to weaker adsorption with oxygen can be expected to more readily release oxygen during OER. (Mn,Co)3O<sup>4</sup> having demonstrated the least ORR and OER activities likely stabilizes oxygen intermediates to the extent that they become inactive for the reactions to further proceed. However, (Mn,Co)3O<sup>4</sup> can still be deemed a suitable catalyst for less energy intensive applications as the abundance of Mn makes it a much more cost-competitive alternative to Co.

### **Conclusions**

In this study, spinel oxide structured nano-crystals self-assembled into mesoporous spheres have been synthesized as bi-functional catalysts active towards oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Experimentally, increasing ORR activity trend has been observed in the order of (Mn,Co)3O<sup>4</sup> < Co3O<sup>4</sup> < (Ni,Co)3O<sup>4</sup> in terms of on-set and half-wave potentials, while increasing OER activity trend has been observed in the order of (Mn,Co)3O<sup>4</sup> < (Ni,Co)3O<sup>4</sup> < Co3O<sup>4</sup> in terms of potential measured at the current density of 10 mA cm-2 . The first-principles density functional theory (DFT) analysis of the catalysts has revealed the same activity trends for both ORR and OER based on the Gibbs free energy obtained at the potential for which all intermediate reactions occur spontaneously. The superior ORR activity of (Ni,Co)3O<sup>4</sup> is attributed to the enhanced electrical conductivity due to the insertion of Ni ions into the octahedral interstitials of spinel lattice promoting rapid charge transfer during the electrocatalytic reaction. The superior OER activity of Co3O<sup>4</sup> is attributed to favorable adsorption strength between oxygen intermediates and active Co cations, facilitating rapid release of evolved oxygen. On the other hand, (Mn,Co)3O<sup>4</sup> has demonstrated relatively lower ORR and OER activities most likely due to lattice expansion and incoherent vibrational modes observed by XRD and Raman analyses, respectively, resulting in over-stabilization and deactivation of oxygen intermediates. The relationship between the composition of spinel oxide catalysts, and the degree of ORR and OER activities investigated in this study by both experiment and computational analysis provides an excellent selection criterion for appropriately choosing a bifunctional catalyst based on the energy requirements of specific applications.

### **Experimental Section**

*Synthesis of Metal Oxide Spheres*

The metal oxide spheres were prepared by a facile solvothermal technique, where a total of 3.0 mmol of cobalt nitrate hexahydrate (2:1 mass ratio of cobalt nitrate hexahydrate and either nickel nitrate hexahydrate or manganese nitrate tetrahydrate for the synthesis of (Ni,Co)3O<sup>4</sup> or (Mn,Co)3O4) was dissolved in a mixed solution of 30 mL of ethylene glycol and 10 mL double de-ionized (DDI) water by stirring for 30 minutes. Then 30 mmol of ammonium bicarbonate was added to the mixture and dissolved by stirring for 30 minutes. The solution was then transferred to a Teflon cup inside a stainless steel autoclave reactor and heated in the oven at 200 <sup>o</sup>C for 24 hours. The resulting solid product was centrifuged five times, three times with DDI water and two times with ethanol, then dried overnight in a 60 <sup>o</sup>C oven. Finally, the dried product was calcined using a furnace in air at 350 <sup>o</sup>C for two hours.

#### *Physical Characterization*

The metal oxide spheres synthesized in this study were characterized by the following techniques. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (LEO FESEM 1530) was used to analyze morphology and surface topology of the materials. Surface area and porosity analyzer (Quantachrome Instruments QuadraSorb SI4) was used to obtain nitrogen absorptiondesorption isotherm for Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area, and Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) model was used to obtain pore size distribution. X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Bruker AXS D8 Advance), Raman spectroscopy (Thermo Fisher Scientific DXR Raman Microscope), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Thermo Scientific K-Alpha XPS spectrometer) were used to confirm the crystal structure, vibrational modes, and elemental composition, respectively.

#### *Electrochemical Evaluation*

The half-cell electrochemical evaluation of the metal oxides was conducted via rotating disk electrode (RDE) voltammetry using a threeelectrode glass cell, potentiostat (CH Instruments 760D), and rotation speed controller (Pine Instruments Co., AFMSRCE). To prepare the working electrode, the ink solution prepared by mixing metal oxide and carbon black (Vulcan Carbon XC-72) in a 1:1 mass ratio in an ethanoldiluted AS-4 (Tokuyama Corp.) ionomer solution having a total active material concentration of 4 mg mL-1 was coated onto a polished glassy carbon disk electrode (5 mm OD) resulting in active material loading of 0.20 mg cm-2 . As the counter and reference electrodes, a platinum wire and saturated calomel electrode (SCE) were used, respectively, and as the electrolyte, 0.1 M potassium hydroxide was used. To activate the working electrode, cyclic voltammetry (CV) was conducted for 20 cycles at the scan rate of 50 mV s-1 , and the background current was measured at the scan rate of 10 mV s-1 within the potential range of 0 to -1.0 V vs SCE in the N2-saturated electrolyte. The oxygen reduction, and oxygen evolution activities were then measured in the oxygen-, and nitrogen-

saturated electrolyte, respectively, at the scan rate of 10 mV s-1 . To measure double layer capacitance, CV of the working electrode was obtained at various scan rates (2.5, 5, 10, 20, 40 mV s-1 ) over a potential window of 60 mV around the open circuit potential in 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate in acetonitrile.

#### *Computational Details*

Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations were carried out using the program BAND[\[19\]](#page-9-19) , where the electron wave functions were developed on a basis set of numerical atomic orbitals (NAOs) and of Slater type orbitals (STOs). The triple polarization (TZP) basis of Slater-type orbitals was used. The calculations were performed by using Revised Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (RPBE) generalized gradient approximation (GGA) for the exchange and correlation energy terms.[\[20\]](#page-9-20) This is a widely accepted function for various applications including metal oxide systems, producing reliable energetics.[\[21\]](#page-9-21) The BAND program performs numerical integrations for all matrix elements.[\[22\]](#page-9-22) The accuracy of the integration in real space (*Accuracy*) and the sampling of the Brillouin zone (KSpace) for the integration accuracy in *k-space* are two key major numerical parameters in the present DFT calculations*.* In the present study, the *Accuracy* parameter was set to 4, which is a reasonable value based on previous analysis[\[15,](#page-9-15) [23\]](#page-9-23) , whereas the *k-space* parameter was set to 3[\[17,](#page-9-17) [24\]](#page-9-24) , which indicates that the quadratic tetrahedron method[\[25\]](#page-9-25) was chosen to perform the k-space numerical integration. The calculations performed on this study were spin-unrestricted. For modelling, the ORR/OER behaviors were predicted on the (110) surface of the spinel crystal using periodic six atomic layer slabs with a (2×2) unit cell. The (110) surface was chosen because it has been predicted to be one of the most stable plane exposed in a number of cubic spinel Co3O<sup>4</sup> specimens prepared by various methods.[\[26\]](#page-10-0) The bottom two atomic layers of the slab was fixed in its bulk positions, whereas the remaining atomic layers and the adsorbed species were set free to relax. On the basis of fully relaxed structures, free energy of each oxygen intermediate reaction (ΔG) during ORR/OER on Co3O4, (Ni,Co)3O4, and (Mn,Co)3O<sup>4</sup> surfaces was calculated. Specifically, the following oxygen intermediate reactions were considered for alkaline electrolyte conditions expressed in terms of OH- 2 () + 22() + 4 <sup>−</sup> ↔ <sup>∗</sup> + 2() + <sup>−</sup> + 3 − (2)

$$00H^* + H_2O(l) + OH^- + 3e^- \leftrightarrow O^* + H_2O(l) + 2OH^- + 2e^-(3)$$

$$0^* + H_2O(l) + 20H^- + 2e^- \leftrightarrow 0H^* + 30H^- + e^-(4)$$

$$0H^* + 30H^- + e^- \leftrightarrow 40H^-(5)$$

Using the expression for ∆G defined as the following ∆G=∆E+∆ZPE-T∆S (6)

where ∆E, ∆ZPE, and ∆S represent the difference in the DFT calculated ground state energy, zero point energy, and entropy corrections, respectively, the free energy of each intermediate reaction was calculated. As an example, the free energy of Reaction (2) (ΔG2) was calculated as a function of the reversible potential U<sup>o</sup> using the following equations ∆<sup>2</sup> = ∆<sup>∗</sup> − ∆2, − 1 ∆<sup>2</sup> − ln <sup>+</sup> + 0 (7)

$$\Delta G_{\text{cours}} = \Delta E_{\text{cours}} + \Delta Z P E_{\text{cours}} - T \Delta S_{\text{cours}}$$
(8)

∆<sup>∗</sup> = ∆<sup>∗</sup> + ΔZPE<sup>∗</sup> − ΔS<sup>∗</sup> (8)

The values of ∆ZPE used, and further details of the free energy calculation can be found in the previously published references. [\[15,](#page-9-15) [27\]](#page-10-1) .

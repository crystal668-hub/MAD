**In the realm of energy conversion and storage devices, transition metal porous oxide composites have been the subject of extensive research and interest. Supercapacitors and electrocatalysis, as two important energy conversion and storage modalities, exhibit a competitive yet balanced relationship, much like a state of equilibrium. In this work, a comprehensive reduction approach is employed during the pyrolysis of anionic/cationic doped molecular clusters, specifically [Zn7L6(3-OCH3)6]·[CoCl4] (where L = 2-methoxy-6- ((methylimino)-methyl)phenolate, abbreviated as Zn7Co1). Notably, within an inert atmosphere, a significant quantity and diverse range of reducing gases are generated throughout the entire pyrolysis temperature spectrum of Zn7Co1, as monitored by thermogravimetry-mass spectrometry (TG-MS). It is observed that the production of these reducing gases led to a reduction in the valence state of metal oxides, thereby inducing a shift in the electrochemical behavior from oxygen evolution to supercapacitive performance at different pyrolysis temperatures. The Zn7Co1-350 sample demonstrated oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance, with an overpotential of 168 mV at a current density of 10 mA·cm<sup>−</sup>2. Conversely, the Zn7Co1-700 sample exhibited excellent capacitance performance, attaining a capacitance of 1406 F·g<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> at a current density of 1 A·g<sup>−</sup>1. The research findings offer a novel synthesis of molecular clusters with electrical performance conversion capabilities via a total reduction strategy.**

**1. Introduction**

Pyrolysis is a highly effective strategy for synthesizing nanomaterials.[\[1,2\]](#page-9-0) One of its key advantages is the generation of reducing gases during the process, which can effectively lower the valence state of materials.[\[3,4\]](#page-9-0) This approach complements the widely used temperature-assisted solid-phase

ion diffusion (TASID) synthesis method. TASID involves heat-treating precursors in various atmospheres such as oxidizing, reducing, carbon-rich, or inert gases to achieve desired structural designs.[\[5\]](#page-9-0) While TASID relies on external gases to induce redox reactions and structural transformations, it can be challenging to simultaneously produce multiple reducing gases within the system to ensure materials are reduced to lower valence states. To address this limitation, a total reduction strategy is willing to be developed. This innovative approach utilizes inert gases to induce the production of a variety of reducing gases, which in turn reduce the valence state of the material at multiple levels, ultimately resulting in materials with multi-functional electrochemical performance for applications.

Supercapacitors and electrocatalysis exhibit competitive and equilibrium characteristics, akin to a balanced state. Notable materials utilized in supercapacitors and electrocatalysis encompass metalorganic frameworks (MOFs),[\[6\]](#page-9-0) sulfides,[\[7\]](#page-9-0) and porous carbon materials.[\[8\]](#page-9-0) The incorporation of porous metal oxides, and porous

carbon composites is beneficial owing to their high surface areato-volume ratio, a critical factor in improving catalytic activity.[\[9,10\]](#page-9-0) The synthesis of these materials can be achieved through various methodologies, including one-step synthesis,[\[11\]](#page-9-0) electrochemical strategies,[\[12\]](#page-9-0) atomic deposition,[\[13\]](#page-9-0) anion/cation doping,[\[14\]](#page-9-0) and other strategies. It should be noted that the total reduction synthesis and anion/cation doping are particularly noteworthy. The total reduction synthesis involves the structural design of materials through the pyrolysis of precursors in an inert gas environment, resulting in unique performance characteristics. Concurrent doping can significantly improve the conductivity of the materials, with common methods including anion/cation doping and dual doping.[\[15\]](#page-9-0) Anion doping, which entails the introduction of nitrogen into carbon materials, not only enhances the wettability of the electrolyte solution, the active surface area, and the ion binding capacity but also increases conductivity by augmenting the density of free charge carriers.[\[16–19\]](#page-9-0) Zhang et al. conducted a study in which Mn, N, and O were incorporated into activated carbon, which enhanced

active specific surface area and optimized the distribution of active sites.[20] While anion doping has been extensively investigated, the significance of cation doping and heteronuclear metal doping is gaining prominence. The incorporation of cation doping is of considerable importance. It not only improves ion kinetics but also increases the stability of the electrode material, which is crucial for enhancing the performance of OER and supercapacitors (SCs).[21] For instance, Zhang et al. doped Te into NiCo-LDH, the structure was a honeycomb, containing active  $\alpha$ -NiCo-LDH phase, the conductivity was improved, and the reaction kinetics was accelerated.[22] Consequently, the incorporation of anion and cation dopants can enhance both the conductivity and stability of materials. Concurrently, the overflow of gas generated by the total reduction strategy leads to the reduction of the valence state of the metal, resulting in more appropriate mesopores and active sites in the material, and enhancing the electron transfer efficiency. While previous research has explored the potential of TASID and anion/cation doping in the design of superior structures that are pivotal in the domains of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and supercapacitors (SCs), the challenge of designing structures that can spontaneously create a reducing atmosphere to further enhance performance remains an unresolved issue.

Among various doped and porous carbon materials, molecular clusters are utilized in electrocatalysis and capacitive reactions due to their ease of doping and their ability to undergo stepwise decomposition at high temperatures, resulting in the formation of stable materials.<sup>[23]</sup> Our group has achieved notable advancements in the field of transition metal clusters. By employing brucite-like  $[M_7]$  clusters, including  $[Co_7]$ ,  $[Ni_7]$   $[Ni_7]$  binary  $[Zn_7]$  and  $[(Ni-Co)_7]$ , [27] we have elucidated their stepwise as-

sembly mechanisms and electrochemical behavior. In addition, we designed  $Zn_{7+2}$  eutectic zinc clusters to be carbon materials with excellent capacitance performance by pyrolysis.<sup>[28]</sup> Although we have made certain progress in the design and application of heptanuclear molecular clusters, it has always been a difficult problem to make this system possess both supercapacitor and electrocatalytic oxygen evolution performance simultaneously.

Taking into account the above-mentioned difficulties and challenges, in this work, we designed an anion exchange method to incorporate Co into the eutectic zinc cluster to synthesize  $Zn_7Co_1$  ([ $Zn_7L_6(\mu_3\text{-}OCH_3)_6$ ]·[ $CoCl_4$ ]). Under the total reduction strategy, the pyrolysis produces a variety of reducing gases to change the valence state of  $Zn_7Co_1\text{-}T$  and realize the electrochemical behavior change. The  $Zn_7Co_1\text{-}T$  was characterized by TG-MS, XPS, and XRD. It is worth noting that our  $Zn_7Co_1$  has different properties at different pyrolysis temperatures. The pyrolysis product at 350 °C has excellent OER electrocatalytic performance, and the pyrolysis product at 700 °C has good capacitance performance due to the overflow of  $CO_2$  and Zn in the total reduction atmosphere (Scheme 1).

#### 2. Results and Discussion

Analysis of single crystal X-ray diffraction data showed that  $Zn_7Co_1$  adopts the monoclinic space group R-3c (Table S1, Supporting Information), and each asymmetric unit contains a  $[Zn_7L_6 (\mu_3\text{-}OCH_3)_6]^{2+}$  cation  $(Zn_7)$  and a  $CoCl_4^{2-}$  anion  $(Co_1)$ , and its molecular formula is  $[Zn_7L_6 (\mu_3\text{-}OCH_3)_6]\cdot[CoCl_4]$ . The cationic  $Zn_7$  unit is connected by  $6\mu_3$ - $OCH_3$  and six surrounding oxygen atoms on the  $\eta_1:\eta_2:\eta_1:\mu_2$  bridging organic ligand at the core. The  $6\mu_3$ - $OCH_3$  bridges the outer zinc octahedron with the central zinc

to form symmetrical fragments of the brucite layer. In [Zn<sub>7</sub>L<sub>6</sub>( $\mu_3$ -OCH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>2+</sup>, the bond length of  $\mu_3$ -O atom is 2.032–2.163°, the bond angle of Zn–O–Zn is 82.59–97.41°, and the bond angle of  $\mu_2$ -O atom is 103.2–103.5°. The CoCl<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> anion is formed by chelating four chlorine atoms of cobalt to the Schiff base ligand (**Figure 1a**; Figure S2, Supporting Information). The anions are Z-shaped between the bc plane stacks (Figure 1b).

To further verify the solution stability of the clusters, ESI-MS was used for detection. The strongest cation peak of  $\mathbf{Zn_7Co_1}$  was found at m/z = 807.0064, which belongs to  $[Zn_7L_6(OH)(OCH_3)_5]^{2+}$ , which may be due to the intramolecular interaction that prevents the decomposition and dissociation of the heptanuclear cluster ligand, which is beneficial to the stability of the single crystal structure. Therefore, Zn<sub>7</sub>Co<sub>1</sub> has a mononuclear peak consistent with the original  $Zn_{7+2}$  after immersion (Figure 1d; Figure S3, Supporting Information). The results showed that the hepta-core framework of Zn<sub>7</sub>Co<sub>1</sub> after immersion was consistent with that of the original Zn<sub>7+2</sub> under mass spectrometry conditions, indicating that the anion replacement could be successfully performed in the presence of CoCl<sub>2</sub>, and **Zn**<sub>7</sub>**Co**<sub>1</sub> had good stability in solution. Furthermore, the mapping map obtained from the scanning electron microscope provides evidence that Co and Zn elements are uniformly distributed

in the crystal (Figure 1c). Therefore,  $\mathbf{Zn_7Co_1}$  underwent significant anion exchange during SC-SC conversion, and  $[\mathbf{Zn_7L_6}(\mu_3-\mathrm{OCH_3})_6]\cdot[\mathrm{CoCl_4}]$  heptanuclear molecular cluster was successfully prepared in  $\mathrm{CoCl_2}\cdot 6\mathrm{H_2O}$  solution.

The characteristics of products resulting from the molecular cluster pyrolysis process significantly influence its properties. To examine the pyrolysis process of  $Zn_7Co_1$ , we employed mass spectrometry in conjunction with thermogravimetry (TG-MS) to analyze its gas composition and identify several critical components:  $H_2$  (m/z = 2),  $CH_3^+$  (m/z = 15),  $CH_3Cl^+$  (m/z = 50),  $CO_2^+$  (m/z = 44), and  $Zn^+$  (m/z = 64). [28,29] TG-MS monitored the reducing gas produced under the total reduction strategy of  $Zn_7Co_1$ . During the pyrolysis process,  $Zn_7Co_1$  was accompanied by phase change. And the whole pyrolysis process was divided into three steps (Figure 2a). At pyrolysis temperatures reached from 25 to 230 °C, no molecular fragments were observed, and thermogravimetric mass spectrometry (TG-MS) confirmed the absence of the guest molecule  $Zn_7Co_1$ . The pyrolysis temperature range of 230 °C to 320 °C, MS detected molecular fragments including H<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup>, and CH<sub>3</sub>Cl<sup>+</sup>, which corresponded to the observed weight loss from TG (Figure 2b). Specifically, the C  $\approx$  H bond is broken to produce H<sub>2</sub>, which dominates the entire pyrolysis process and converts metal oxides into metal elements;

The CH<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup> can be attributed to the decomposition of ligands in cationic clusters (Zn<sub>7</sub>) and the cleavage of unstable ether bonds in bridging methoxy groups; The CH<sub>3</sub>Cl<sup>+</sup> is synthesized through the reaction of the CH<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>-</sup>, which was produced by the breaking of Co-Cl bond in anion (CoCl<sub>4</sub>)<sup>2-</sup> (Figure 2b). According to these analyses, a molecule decomposes to produce 8 CH<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup> and 4 CH<sub>3</sub>Cl<sup>+</sup>. Interestingly, the weight loss data obtained by TG detection and the calculation results of each fragment using MS are accurately matched. The TG-MS was used to detect the samples, and it was found that the weight loss behavior of the samples was single when the temperature increased to 480-600 °C, which only showed CO<sub>2</sub> dissociation from the system. This stage may be the process of carbon and H<sub>2</sub> reducing metallic oxide to metal elements and releasing a great deal of CO<sub>2</sub>. The peak of  $Zn^+$  (m/z = 64) was detected above 600 °C (Figure 2c), indicating that liquid zinc escaped from the system. The departure of Zn leaves vacancies to create micropores, so that Co atoms enter the voids to fill and produce a porous carbon structure. According to TG and TG-MS, the formula of this chemical process is:

$$\left[\operatorname{Zn}_{7}\operatorname{L}_{6}\left(\mu_{3}-\operatorname{OCH}_{3}\right)_{6}\right]\cdot\left[\operatorname{CoCl}_{4}\right]\rightarrow \operatorname{H}_{2}+8\operatorname{CH}_{3}^{+}+4\operatorname{CH}_{3}\operatorname{Cl}^{+} +8\operatorname{ZnO/CoO}+\operatorname{carbon layer} (1)$$

In light of the preceding analysis and conjectures, we have chosen pyrolysis products at temperatures of 300, 350, 600, 700, and 800 °C to investigate pore formation and phase transitions. The scanning electron microscope image (Figure 1e) reveals that the Zn<sub>7</sub>Co<sub>1</sub>-T compound exhibits a hexagonal crystalline structure, with Zn and Co being uniformly distributed throughout the crystal lattice. This structural integrity is maintained across the five pyrolysis temperatures examined, indicating a commendable level of structural stability for Zn<sub>7</sub>Co<sub>1</sub>-T. Furthermore, to investigate the pore carbon structure within the pyrolyzed Zn<sub>7</sub>Co<sub>1</sub>, nitrogen adsorption/desorption measurements were conducted at 77 K (Figure S4, Supporting Information). The specific surface area of Zn<sub>7</sub>Co<sub>1</sub>-600, Zn<sub>7</sub>Co<sub>1</sub>-700 and Zn<sub>7</sub>Co<sub>1</sub>-800 calculated by BET method is 241, 274, 327 m<sup>2</sup>·g<sup>-1</sup>, and the total pore volume is 0.10878, 0.25344, 0.30222  $\text{m}^3 \cdot \text{g}^{-1}$ . This may be due to the formation of a microporous structure caused by the evaporation and escape of Zn at high temperatures, which further improves the specific surface area.[30,31] Meanwhile, the pore structure of Zn<sub>7</sub>Co<sub>1</sub>-T predominantly consists of micropores with a size of less than 2 nm. This characteristic is advantageous for enhancing the performance of supercapacitors.

According to the results of TG-MS, the Zn<sub>7</sub>Co<sub>1</sub> has a phase change during the total reduction process. According to the results of XRD, the strong diffraction peaks associated with ZnO, CoO, and Co were observed in the pyrolysis products at different specific temperatures (300, 350, 600, 700, 800 °C) (Figure 2d). The pyrolysis temperature is 300 and 350 °C, the obvious diffraction peaks at 31.9°, 34.6°, 36.2°, and 56.7° assigned to (100), (002), (101), and (110) crystal planes of ZnO (JCPDS 36-1451), meanwhile 77.7° assigned to (222) crystal planes of CoO (JCPDS 48-1719). This may be due to the low crystallinity of the pyrolysis products and many defects, thus enriching the electron transfer channels and exposing more active sites.<sup>[32]</sup> In the pyrolysis products at 600, 700 and 800 °C, the diffraction peaks at 36.2°, assigned to (101) crystal planes of ZnO. The diffraction peaks at 42.51°, and 77.7° correspond to (200), (222) crystal planes of CoO, and 44.45°, 51.61°, and 75.94° attributed to the (111), (200), (220) crystal planes of Co (JCPDS 15-0806). However, when the pyrolysis temperature is 800, the ZnO diffraction peak disappears, and the Co and CoO diffraction peaks still exist. This may be due to the reduction of metal oxides into metal elements by the presence of H<sub>2</sub>, and the spillover of Zn. The pyrolysis product is Co at Zn<sub>7</sub>Co<sub>1</sub>-800. To further explore the composition of the phase, we carried out an HRTEM analysis of Zn<sub>7</sub>Co<sub>1</sub>-350 and Zn<sub>7</sub>Co<sub>1</sub>-700. The HRTEM of Zn<sub>7</sub>Co<sub>1</sub>-350 shows lattice fringes with a lattice spacing of 0.279, 0.262, 0.248, and 0.123 nm, which are attributed to ZnO (100), ZnO (002), ZnO (101) and CoO (222) crystal planes. In the HRTEM of Zn<sub>7</sub>Co<sub>1</sub>-700, we found lattice stripes with a lattice spacing of 0.246, 0.202, and 0.129 nm, belonging to ZnO (101), Co (101) and CoO (311), respectively (Figure 3a,b). The phase of Zn<sub>7</sub>Co<sub>1</sub>-350 and Zn<sub>7</sub>Co<sub>1</sub>-700 in HRTEM is consistent with that in XRD. In addition, mapping further proves that both Zn<sub>7</sub>Co<sub>1</sub>-350 and Zn<sub>7</sub>Co<sub>1</sub>-700 contain Co and Zn, and the content of Zn decreases at 700 °C. Therefore, we can determine that the phase of Zn<sub>7</sub>Co<sub>1</sub>-T changes from metal oxide to elemental under the action of a total reduction strategy. The ICP data of Zn and Co in Zn<sub>7</sub>Co<sub>1</sub>-T show that the content of Zn is the highest at 600 °C, the content of Zn begins to decrease at 700 °C, and only 0.15% is left at 800 °C, which is consistent with the Zn spillover curve of TG-MS (Table S3, Supporting Information). Similarly, further characterization by Raman spectroscopy showed that structural defects began to appear in the pyrolysis products of Zn<sub>7</sub>Co<sub>1</sub> at low temperatures (T = 300, 350 °C). The pyrolysis products at 600, 700, and 800 °C were studied. It was found that the D/G band intensity ratio  $(I_D/I_C)$  increased from 0.87 to 1.04, indicating that the internal defect state was significant<sup>[33–35]</sup> (Figure S5, Supporting Information).

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to determine the elemental species and chemical valence of the material. The XPS full spectrum shows that C, N, O, Co, and Zn are contained at different pyrolysis temperatures, and the peaks are located at 285, 399.9, 531.9, 781.2, and 1022 eV, respectively. It was found that the peak intensity of Zn decreases, and the peak intensity of the high-resolution Zn 2p spectrum also decreases [36] (Figure 2e; Figure S6, Supporting Information). This may be due to the presence of  $\rm H_2$  and carbon in the ligand that ZnO is reduced to Zn, which is finally reduced and evaporated at 800 °C in large quantities. The high-resolution Co 2p spectrum has two existing forms

of Co0 (778.8 eV) and Co2<sup>+</sup> (781.2 eV), respectively[[37\]](#page-9-0) (Figure [2f,g;](#page-3-0) Figure S7, Supporting Information). The content of Co2<sup>+</sup> is the highest in Zn7Co1-350, and the content of Co0 is the highest in Zn7Co1-800. This may be due to the escape of H2 and Zn from the system under high-temperature conditions. This process increases the reducing atmosphere in the system, and it is difficult for Co2<sup>+</sup> to maintain its original valence state, which is reduced to Co0, and the valence state is changed (Figure [2h\)](#page-3-0). This observation is corroborated by the X-ray diffraction (XRD) results. The C1s orbital peak is divided into three peaks: sp2C (284.8 eV), C─C

or C-O (285.6-285.8 eV), C=C or C=O (288.5-288.7 eV) (Figure S8, Supporting Information). The O<sub>1s</sub> orbital has three forms of M-O metal bond (530.1 eV), C=O (531.6 eV), C-O (533 eV). The M-O metal bond strength reaches its peak at 350 °C, indicating a significant presence of metal oxides on the surface of Zn<sub>7</sub>Co<sub>1</sub>. This abundance of metal oxides enhances the OER performance of the material. The detection of C=O indicates a considerable presence of oxygen-containing functional groups in Zn<sub>7</sub>Co<sub>1</sub>, which may promote the development of defects and subsequently improve the electrocatalytic reaction<sup>[38]</sup> (Figure S9, Supporting Information). The  $N_{1s}$  orbital mainly shows four N species, which are pyridine-N (398.5 eV), M-Nx (399.2 eV), pyrrole-N (400.2 eV), and graphite-N (402.2 eV) (Figure S10, Supporting Information). Graphite nitrogen has higher stability and electron transfer rate, which can improve the stability and conductivity of the electrocatalyst.<sup>[39]</sup> Pyridine nitrogen can enhance the pseudo capacitance, so the electron transfer efficiency and electron storage in the electrocatalytic process are better, and the nitrogen-rich graphite carbon further improves the stability of the electrocatalyst.[40]

To study the local environmental changes of Zn and Co atoms in  $\mathbf{Zn_7Co_1}$ -T, the  $\mathbf{Zn_7Co_1}$ -T catalyst was further characterized by X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS). XAS is used to represent the average valence state change and bond length change of the sample. The Zn K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) shows that the valence of zinc is reduced, and the extended X-ray absorption fine (EXAFS) shows The Zn—O bond peak of  $\mathbf{Zn_7Co_1}$ -700 is located at 1.5 Å, and the Zn—Zn

bond peak is located at 2.8 Å. The Zn–Zn bond is between the Zn foil and Zn–Zn of ZnO, reflecting that it is in a mixed valence state, and a part of ZnO is reduced to Zn, [41,42] (Figure 4a,b). The valence state of Co K-edge and the strength of Co–O bond decreased, indicating that the oxidation state of Co changed from CoO to Co element at 800 °C. At the same time, the EXAFS 1.4 Å Co–O/Co–N bond peak, 2.17 Å Co–Co bond peak, and 2.3 Å Co–Cl bond peak can be observed (Figure 4c,d). The coincidence of EXAFS of  $\mathbf{Zn}_7\mathbf{Co}_1\text{-800}$  with Co foil indicates that almost all the samples are Co at 800 °C. The XAS results may be due to the overflow of  $\mathbf{H}_2$  at high temperatures, the formation and escape of Zn, which leads to the change of bond. This observation is consistent with the results of XRD and XPS.

The electrochemical behavior varies significantly with different pyrolysis temperatures. In Zn<sub>7</sub>Co<sub>1</sub>-350, the high content of metal oxides leads to excellent electrocatalytic performance; In Zn<sub>7</sub>Co<sub>1</sub>-700, the porous metal structure is beneficial to superior capacitive behavior (**Table 1**). To evaluate the electrocatalytic performance of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) after pyrolysis of Zn<sub>7</sub>Co<sub>1</sub> clusters, the catalytic activity of Zn<sub>7</sub>Co<sub>1</sub>-T was studied in 1 M KOH solution with a standard three-electrode device. At a current density of 10 mA·cm<sup>-2</sup>, the corresponding overpotential of Zn<sub>7</sub>Co<sub>1</sub>-350 is 168 mV, which is lower than the corresponding values of several Zn and Codoped materials reported previously (**Figures 5a**,f). At the same time, when the current density is 50 m A·cm<sup>-2</sup>, the overpotential of Zn<sub>7</sub>Co<sub>1</sub>-350 is only 242 mV. The findings indicate

that the material exhibits favorable catalytic performance. Concurrently, the reaction kinetics in the electrocatalytic process is related to the Tafel slope. Specifically, the Tafel slope for the  $Zn_7Co_1-350$  sample is measured at 82.32 mV·dec<sup>-1</sup> (Figure 5b). The complete cyclic voltammetry curve was tested in the range of 1.0-1.0 V. The complete CV curve showed that Zn<sub>7</sub>Co<sub>1</sub>-350 had an obvious redox peak, indicating that the electrochemical process was reversible (Figure S11, Supporting Information). The CV of the electrocatalyst was analyzed to assess the electric double layer capacitance associated with its specific surface area for electrocatalysis (Figure S12, Supporting Information). As illustrated in Figure 5c, the calculated C<sub>dl</sub> value for Zn<sub>7</sub>Co<sub>1</sub>-350 was found to be 35.57 mF·cm<sup>-2</sup>, which exceeds the electric double layer capacitance observed at other temperatures. This finding suggests that Zn<sub>7</sub>Co<sub>1</sub>-350 possesses a greater number of catalytic active sites during the electrolysis process. Concurrently, At the same time, the Zn<sub>7</sub>Co<sub>1</sub>-350 electrocatalyst showed strong charge transfer, as shown in the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) shown in Figure 5d. The  $\mathbf{Zn_7Co_1}$ -350 exhibits the smallest semicircle, indicative of the highest electron transfer rate. Furthermore, the durability of electrocatalysts is of paramount importance for their practical applications. As depicted in Figure 5e, chronopotentiometry (CP) was employed to assess the electrocatalytic durability of  $\mathbf{Zn_7Co_1}$ -350 for OER in 1 M KOH solution. At the same time, the electrolyte solution was tested by ICP after the CP test, and the contents of Zn and Co were 36.32 and 1.80 mg L<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. The results revealed no significant degradation over a continuous 20 h test, thereby confirming its exceptional stability (Table S4, Supporting Information).

To explore the electrochemical properties of Zn<sub>7</sub>Co<sub>1</sub> clusters after high-temperature pyrolysis, a 3-electrode system was selected to test its performance. As shown in **Figure 6a**, the *CV* curves of Zn<sub>7</sub>Co<sub>1</sub>-600, Zn<sub>7</sub>Co<sub>1</sub>-700, and Zn<sub>7</sub>Co<sub>1</sub>-800 samples were measured in the range of 0.3–1.0 V at a scan rate of 5 mV·s<sup>-1</sup>. The integral area of the *CV* curve for **Zn<sub>7</sub>Co<sub>1</sub>-700** was markedly greater than that of materials subjected to other temperature conditions, suggesting an enhancement in capacitance. By maintaining a constant voltage window, *CV* curves were recorded at varying scan rates. The integral area of the *CV* curve exhibited an increase with the elevation of the scan rate, while the overall shape of the curve remained relatively consistent (Figure S13, Supporting Information). This observation indicates that the sample possesses rapid charge/discharge kinetic properties and demonstrates favorable reversibility. As illustrated in Figure 6b,

The Zn<sub>7</sub>Co<sub>1</sub>-700 exhibits the longest charge-discharge duration at 1 A·g<sup>-1</sup> and the highest specific capacitance value. Further investigations were conducted on the constant current charge and discharge profiles of Zn<sub>7</sub>Co<sub>1</sub>-600 to Zn<sub>7</sub>Co<sub>1</sub>-800 across various current densities. These profiles exhibit a characteristic triangular shape and demonstrate a high degree of symmetry (Figure \$14, Supporting Information). Based on the GCD curve, the specific capacitance values for Zn<sub>7</sub>Co<sub>1</sub>-700 are recorded as 1406, 1257, 1243, 1203, and 982 F·g<sup>-1</sup> at current densities of 1, 2, 5, 10, and 20 A·g<sup>-1</sup>, respectively (Figure 6d). In comparison to other temperature-sensitive materials, Zn<sub>7</sub>Co<sub>1</sub>-700 exhibits a superior specific capacitance value, with its maximum specific capacitance surpassing that of several previously documented Zn and Codoped materials (Figure 6e). The improvement of the capacitance performance of Zn<sub>7</sub>Co<sub>1</sub> is due to the optimal pore size of the carbon material produced by the evaporation of Zn at an appropriate pyrolysis temperature. Furthermore, The EIS test adopts a three-electrode structure, and the frequency range is established between 100 kHz and 0.01 Hz. As shown in Figure 6c, the impedance curve of Zn<sub>7</sub>Co<sub>1</sub>-700 shows a smaller radius, which indicates that the electron transfer resistance is lower at this temperature. This condition facilitates rapid ion diffusion and migration, thereby significantly enhancing the capacitance behavior of the material, a finding that aligns with the analyses derived from the CV and GCD curves. Figure \$15 (Supporting Information) illustrates the favorable cycle life of Zn<sub>7</sub>Co<sub>1</sub>-700. After 5000 chargedischarge cycles, the capacitance retention rate of the material did not decrease significantly and exceeded 90%, indicating good cycle stability.[43-45] It is posited that the coordination of zinc and cobalt bimetals at low temperatures enhances the availability of active sites in Zn<sub>7</sub>Co<sub>1</sub>-T, thereby facilitating an improvement in OER activity. Conversely, the evaporation of Zn at high temperature leads to the formation of internal multidimensional pores. During this process, Co occupies some of the larger pores, allowing Zn<sub>7</sub>Co<sub>1</sub> to transform into a nano-sized porous carbon material that demonstrates superior capacitance performance.

# 3. Conclusion

In summary, the total reduction strategy has been successfully implemented in a heptanuclear molecular cluster,  $[Zn_7L_6(\mu_3-$ OCH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>6</sub>]·[CoCl<sub>4</sub>], which undergoes anion/cation exchange reactions. The reducing gases generated during pyrolysis trigger a transformation in the resulting material, shifting it from exhibiting excellent electrochemical oxygen evolution performance to remarkable energy storage capabilities. Simultaneously, XRD and XAS analyses reveal that the metal oxides are converted into elemental forms, accompanied by the escape of zinc. The increased content of elemental cobalt facilitates the formation of multi-dimensional pores, rendering Zn<sub>7</sub>Co<sub>1</sub>-700 an ideal porous

Metal oxides typically form superior electrocatalytic materials, whereas porous-structured metal elemental substances are more conducive to forming high-performance capacitive materials. Specifically,  $\rm Zn_7Co_1\text{-}350$  shows an overpotential of 168 mV at 10 mA·cm $^{-2}$ . For  $\rm Zn_7Co_1\text{-}700$ , it has a maximum surface area of 274 m $^2$ ·g $^{-1}$  and a capacitance of 1406 F·g $^{-1}$  at 1 A·g $^{-1}$ . This study achieves, for the first time, the transformation between electrocatalytic and capacitive performance within a molecular cluster system. We also anticipate that the total reduction strategy will hold great appeal in other material systems for electrochemical applications.

[Mrunal Bhosale,](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6781-3239) [Sadhasivam Thangarasu,\\*](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8431-233X) [Nagaraj Murugan,](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2838-4993) [Yoong Ahm Kim,](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4074-7515) and [Tae-Hwan Oh\\*](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4922-5000)

Herein, the strategy of homogenous inclusion of nanoparticles within the surface and interlayers of 2D MXenes is established to achieve effective oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance. A greater quantity of nano-sized Ni(OH)2 particles is uniformly anchored on multilayered accordion-like nanosheets of Ti3C2Tx. The strong interconnection of Ni(OH)2 on Ti3C2T<sup>x</sup> promotes synergistic effects and improves electron transfer properties alongside the intrinsic OER activity. The Ti3C2Tx-Ni(OH)2-4 demonstrates remarkable OER activity by exhibiting a lower overpotential (235.54 mV at 10 mA cm<sup>2</sup> ) in alkaline conditions. Increased electrochemical active surface area (2.925 mF cm<sup>2</sup> ), lower charge transfer resistance, lowering the reaction barrier, and stabilizing/converting essential intermediates via the Ti3C2Tx-Ni(OH)2 electrocatalyst synergistically improve OER activity. The effective interaction between Ti3C2T<sup>x</sup> and Ni(OH)2 in Ti3C2Tx-Ni(OH)2 improves stability during long-term operations. Moreover, a Ti3C2Tx-Ni(OH)2-4||Pt/C cell has 1.7V at 10 mA cm<sup>1</sup> . It can be deduced that the usage of Ni(OH)2 as an electrocatalyst together with Ti3C2T<sup>x</sup> can provide noteworthy water-splitting properties.

## 1. Introduction

The hydrogen energy technologies are the most needed in the present situation for resolving the future energy needs and overcoming the energy-related issues.[1–6] In this view, numerous kinds of efforts have been devoted to developing various techniques to produce hydrogen in a feasible and efficient way. Though most of the efforts provide certain negative demerits, specifically environmental contaminations, complicated production processes, and high-cost techniques.[7–10] In this connection, the electrolysis of water is an efficient approach to generating hydrogen. The electrocatalytic water-splitting process is a favorable way to produce hydrogen in a cleaner way without any harmful byproducts.[11–14] In overall water splitting, the hydrogen production performance mostly relies on the electrocatalyst materials. Typically, the platinum

group materials (PGM) and their composites-based structures are effectively considered an excellent option for the water-splitting process because of their optimal chemical bond strength with reaction intermediates in electrocatalysis. The hydrogen adsorption free energy (ΔGH\* = 0)[15,16] serves as a critical feature for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), with platinum situated at the highest point of the hydrogen adsorption energy volcano plot, indicating its exceptional catalytic efficacy for HER. The Ir- and Ru-based compounds have effectively been considered a superior performance electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Based on the structural framework of RuO2, four key strategies can be employed to significantly enhance the OER activity. These approaches include: elevating the position of the d-band center, modulating the coordination environment of Ru atoms, establishing Ru–O–M moieties, and employing vacancy engineering.[17] Ir-based electrocatalysts with organized atomic arrangements exhibit well-defined architectures of active sites with an evenly dispersed structure.[18] This precise atomic organization optimizes the accessibility and reactivity of active sites, contributing to enhanced catalytic performance.[17–20] The rarity and production cost of PGM significantly affect the overall merits of the electrocatalytic water-splitting process.[21–27] Thus, researchers worldwide focusing on the development of costeffective and high-performance of electrocatalysts for the efficient electrocatalytic performance, with the ability to replace the traditional electrocatalyst materials. In this connection, the layered materials have definite benefits to serve as an excellent electrocatalyst material for the electrocatalytic water-splitting process. Generally, the 2D materials can be classified into different categories, such as graphene and its derivatives, MXenes, layered double hydroxides, chalcogenides, and oxides.[28] The 2D layered structures can effectively influence the electrocatalytic performances because of their tunable electronic properties, high surface-to-volume ratio, good electrical and thermal conductivities, excellent charge transport efficiency.[29,30]

In the recent period, transition metal carbide-based materials have been widely utilized as excellent electrode and electrocatalyst materials for various electrochemical applications. In this view, the emerging materials of MXenes have been considered as an efficient candidate for the water-splitting process. The high specific surface area of modified 2D MXenes has many beneficial properties for water-splitting applications, such as efficient conductivity and reasonable hydrophilicity.[31,32] MXene possesses the capability to influence the development and future of overall water splitting using MXene-based bifunctional electrocatalysts in alkaline environments for the enhancement of catalytic activity in targeted reactions via precise composition modification.[33,34] A notable characteristic is the hydrophilicity, which allows for the facile accessibility of reactants to active sites and enhances the efficient movement of charge carriers, hence advancing the overall catalytic process.[35,36] The MXene surface accumulates functional groups following etching that serve as binding sites for external active phases.[37-39] Furthermore, the adaptability in achieving required functionalization on the MXene surface facilitates the formation of MXene-based nanohybrids or heterostructures, whereby the active phases are intensely integrated with the MXene surface. The intermediate interaction between MXene and active catalysts enhances stability, prevents aggregation, and promotes synergistic effects, resulting in improved catalytic performance. [33,36] Among the different kinds of MXenes materials, the Ti-based MXenes (Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>2</sub>) structure has been considered one of the finest materials from the initial developments in 2011<sup>[40,41]</sup> for various applications, including the electrocatalytic water-splitting process. Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> has the excellent properties of remarkable layered structures, exceptional mechanical properties, high charge carrier mobility  $(2.6 \pm 0.7 \, \text{cm}^{-2} \, \text{V}^{-1} \, \text{s}^{-1})$ , better electrical conductivity, and regulating surface chemistry. [34,42,43] Apart from the numerous benefits associated with Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub>, the unexpected weak van der Waals forces between the interlayers in  $Ti_3C_2T_x$  lead to creating the significant drawbacks of aggregation, which leads decreasing the active regions and poorer electrocatalytic performances. [40] Moreover, the bifunctional activity is limited for the bare Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> because of lower activity in reaction intermediates and the requirement for high energy during the water-splitting process.<sup>[40]</sup> Thus, the developments mainly focused toward enhancing the performance of different nanostructured materials together with Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> in the way of synergetic mechanism as a mutually beneficial approach. The significant aggregation between the  $Ti_3C_2T_x$  nanosheets can be controlled by the incorporation of the nanomaterials between each layer and on the surfaces, which influences the activity of Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> toward the efficient electrocatalyst. Furthermore, the Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> can effectively act as an excellent substrate material f or the various nanostructures by connective and coupling effects, which provides a high surface region, increases the stability, and excellent conductivity to the nanostructured materials.

From the identification of  $Ti_3C_2T_{x'}$  several approaches of  $Ti_3C_2T_{x'}$ -based composites and interconnected structures have been established to attain the efficient electrocatalytic water splitting. A robust, effective approach for manufacturing CoFe LDH on  $Ti_3C_2T_x$  MXene was developed, whereby the surface reactivity of  $Ti_3C_2T_x$  determines the creation of a heterostructure with adjustable

crystal domain sizes. This leads to optimal heterostructures with elevated OER activity characterized by an overpotential of 301 mV at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. The O-terminations on the Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> surface efficiently restrict the CoFe LDH domain size, augmenting edge defects and diminishing layer thickness, hence improving the catalytic activity. [44] A unique MXene@Bi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> heterostructure demonstrates enhanced electrocatalytic performance for the OER with an overpotential of about 278 mV at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. The integration of Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> MXene with Bi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> results in accelerated charge transfer kinetics and improved intrinsic activity, contributing to the overall enhancement in electrocatalytic performance.<sup>[45]</sup> The developed Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>@g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> heterostructure anchored on Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> MXene exhibits efficient OER with 247 mV overpotential at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>@q-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> anchoring on Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> MXene improves electron structure and charge transfer rates. This interaction greatly enhances catalyst conductivity, boosting OER catalytic efficacy.<sup>[46]</sup> The Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> and ZIF-67 combination was engineered to enhance OER performance, demonstrating an overpotential of 366 mV (188 mV dec<sup>-1</sup> Tafel slope). The increased exposure of active areas significantly improves mass transfer in electrocatalytic processes, hence enhancing catalytic efficiency.<sup>[47]</sup> In this connection, the Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> can provide an advanced opportunity to enhance the OER activity of 3D transition metals-based electrocatalysts because of its intrinsic properties, such as a large surface area due to the layered structure, hydrophilic properties introduced by surface termination groups, and metallic and transitory electronic states.[34,48,49] Among the different kinds of transition metal-based electrocatalysts, nickel(II) hydroxide (Ni(OH)2) showed considerable efforts together with different kinds of layered materials for boosting the OER performances. The most excellent water oxidation potential arises from its favorable electronic structure and catalytic properties, which facilitate the adsorption of reactants, and intermediates of Ni(OH)2 is the key reason for its efficient OER activity. [50,51] Though inappropriate selection of materials, size, and structure provide inferior electrical conductivity, low active sites, irreversible transformations during the reaction process, and limited stability, reducing the Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> catalytic activity.<sup>[52,53]</sup> In the present investigations, the establishment focused on the multilayered accordion-like nanosheets of Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> together with Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> as a high-performance composite electrocatalyst. A homogeneous inclusion of nanosized Ni(OH)2 in the surface and interlayers of Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> MXenes was developed. A variety of levels of Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub>-Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> were developed by altering the various concentrations. The Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub>-Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>-4 electrocatalyst demonstrated good OER activity, characterized by a smaller overpotential of 235.54 mV at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> in 1 M KOH. There is an improvement in stability during long-term operations as a result of the successful connection between Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> and Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> in Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub>-Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>. While simultaneously enhancing the intrinsic OER activity, the robust connectivity of Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> on Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> promotes synergistic effects and increases electron transport characteristics. The cell constituted of Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub>-Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>-4||Pt/C demonstrated a 1.7 V cell voltage at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. For the synthesis and assessment of electrocatalysts with Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> and Ni-based compounds, this investigation provides valuable perspectives and applied methodologies.

# 3. Results and Discussion

The crystallinity and phase of as-developed materials were established by the X-ray diffraction (XRD) study. The XRD spectra of Ti3AlC2 MAX phase (Figure S1, Supporting Information) contain the diffraction peaks at 9.7°, 19.3°, 34.1°, 36.9°, 38.9°, 41.9°, 48.6°, 56.5°, 60.3°, 65.5°, 70.4°, and 74.1° corresponding to (002), (004), (101), (103), (008), (105), (107), (109), (110), (1011), (1012), and (118).[43,54,55] Figure 2a illustrates the XRD pattern of Ti3C2T<sup>x</sup> MXene and Ti3C2Tx-Ni (OH)2 electrocatalysts. The Ti3C2T<sup>x</sup> MXene exhibits the diffract peaks at 8.8° (002), 18.0° (004), 34.2° (101), 35.9° (102), 41.7° (105), and 60.5° (110), respectively. The selective etching of the Al layer in the MAX phase through HF treatment resulted in the disappearance of the prominent diffraction peak at 38.4°. This transformation indicates the effective transformation of the MAX phase into Ti3C2T<sup>x</sup> MXene. The peak shifting from 9.7° to 8.8° in the Ti3C2T<sup>x</sup> indicates the delamination and the termination groups introduced during the etching process.[56] The XRD spectra of Ti3C2Tx-Ni(OH)2-4 demonstrate the peak at 6.1°, 17.1°, 34.6°, and 61.1° for Ti3C2Tx. The Ni(OH)2 is present at 10.9° and 22.2° diffraction peaks with (003) and (006) planes.[57,58] This verifies the development of α-Ni(OH)2 phase with rhombohedral crystal structure (JCPDS card no. 00-038-0715). The XRD pattern of Ti3C2Tx-Ni(OH)2-1, Ti3C2Tx-Ni(OH)2-2, and Ti3C2Tx-Ni(OH)2-3 is demonstrated in Figure S2, Supporting Information. The observed diffraction peaks align closely with the characteristic patterns of Ti3C2T<sup>x</sup> MXene and Ni(OH)2. This suggests a strong structural similarity or possible integration between these two materials in the examined sample. The d-spacing for Ti3C2Tx, and Ti3C2Tx-Ni(OH)2-4 was intended by the Bragg's law,[59] nλ = 2dsinθ. λ indicates the wavelength of the X-ray source, d implies the lattice spacing, and θ characterizes

the diffraction angle. For pristine Ti3C2T<sup>x</sup> MXene d-spacing for the (002) plane is 10.04 Å.[60,61] In the Ti3C2Tx-Ni(OH)2-4 combination,Ti3C2T<sup>x</sup> exhibits the d-spacing 14.4 Å for the (002) plane. The peak shifting from 8.8° to 6.1° for the (002) plane of Ti3C2T<sup>x</sup> implies an increased d-spacing of Ti3C2T<sup>x</sup> after the inclusion of Ni(OH)2. These results collectively suggest a strong structural interaction between Ti3C2T<sup>x</sup> MXene and Ni(OH)2 within the composite, representing the successful assembly of a hybrid material with enriched interlayer spacing and distinct crystalline features. The Raman spectroscopy technique was carried out to determine the structural properties of the Ti3C2T<sup>x</sup> and Ti3C2Tx-Ni(OH)2-4 composite (Figure 2b). Raman spectra of Ti3C2T<sup>x</sup> exhibit the peaks at 189, 224.9, 429.5, 621.3, 729.7, 1327.4, and 1571.9 cm<sup>1</sup> . The peak at 189, 621.3, and 729.7 cm<sup>1</sup> corresponds to the A1g mode of carbon and titanium vibrations (Ti─C).[47,62,63] The peak at 224.9 cm<sup>1</sup> shows the vibrational states, which are related to the terminated functional surface groups (Tx) introduced during the etching process.[47,64] The Raman shift at 429.5 cm<sup>1</sup> is accredited to the energy gap features associated with the in-plane Ti─OH and Ti─O surface functional groups, further emphasizing the role of functionalization.[65] Two additional peaks are present at 1327.4 and 1571.9 cm<sup>1</sup> in the Ti3C2T<sup>x</sup> that reveal the carbonbased D band and G band vibrations, which demonstrate the existence of carbon and disorder in the sample.[43,66] The strong G band peak at 1571.9 cm<sup>1</sup> specifies a highly ordered layer structure ordering within the delaminated Ti3C2T<sup>x</sup> layers following the selective removal of aluminum.[66] The Raman spectra of the Ti3C2Tx-Ni(OH)2-4 composite exhibit similar characteristic peaks in the spectrum of both the pure MXene and Ti3C2Tx-Ni(OH)2-4 composites, confirming the presence of Ti3C2T<sup>x</sup> within the composite. For Ni(OH)2, the Raman peak at 449.1 cm<sup>1</sup> is analogous to the lattice mode of α-Ni(OH)2. [57,67] Furthermore, the 584.8, 758.7, and 972.4 cm<sup>1</sup> are identified to be the vibration of α-Ni(OH)2. [67] The similarities between the Raman spectra of pristine Ti3C2T<sup>x</sup> and the Ti3C2Tx-Ni(OH)2-4 composite verify the successful retention of the MXenes structural integrity within the composite. Meanwhile, the additional peaks attributed to α-Ni(OH)2 indicate the incorporation of the hydroxide phase into the composite.

The chemical composition and surface oxidation states of Ti3C2Tx, Ti3C2Tx-Ni(OH)2-1, and Ti3C2Tx-Ni(OH)2-4 electrocatalysts were evaluated using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The survey spectrum of XPS of Ti3C2T<sup>x</sup> is composed of titanium (Ti), carbon (C), and oxygen (O) with fluorine (F) expressed in Figure S3, Supporting Information. The Ti mainly forms the primary metallic layer within the MXene structure, carbon is present in the carbide layers, and oxygen forms during the targeted etching of the Al layer within the Ti3AlC2 MAX phase.[68] As observed in the survey spectrum of Ti3C2Tx-Ni(OH)2-1 and Ti3C2Tx-Ni(OH)2-4, the composite exhibits the elements of T, C, O, F, and nickel (Ni). The Ti and C components exist in the Ti3C2T<sup>x</sup> MXene. The O is present from the Ti3C2T<sup>x</sup> Mxene, as well as hydroxide ions in the Ni(OH)2. The Ni element in the Ni(OH)2 was obtained from a Ni source. A complete analysis of the fine spectrum for each of the aforementioned elements will be thoroughly performed to elucidate the interfacial characteristics and the valence states within the composite. The high-resolution XPS spectra of Ti2p were displayed in Figure 2c for Ti3C2T<sup>x</sup> and Ti3C2Tx-Ni(OH)2-4. For pristine Ti3C2T<sup>x</sup> Ti2p spectra are deconvoluted into eight different peaks. The peaks at 454.9 and 459.1 eV are assigned to the Ti─C bonding.[69,70] The binding energy related to the 455.6 and 460.9 eV exhibited the T2<sup>þ</sup> oxidation state.[60,69] The binding energy at 458.5 and 464.9 eV is analogous to the Ti–O of 2p3/2 orbital.[60,71] The peaks at 456.2 and 462.4 eV corresponding to the Ti<sup>3</sup><sup>þ</sup> belonged to the 2p3/2 and 2p1/2. [71,72] In the Ti3C2Tx-Ni(OH)2-1 composite, the deconvoluted Ti2p spectra (Figure S4a, Supporting Information) confirm the binding energies at 454.5, 455.4, 456.5, 458.1, 459.0, 460.6, 462.5, and 464.5 eV, which are closely assigned to the pristine Ti3C2Tx. Regarding Ti3C2Tx-Ni(OH)2-4 the Ti2p spectra exhibited the peak corresponding to 454.8, 455.8, 457.1, 458.0, 458.9, 460.4, 462.5, and 464.3 eV which shows the higher amount of Ni(OH)2 exhibits the shift toward higher binding energy as compared to the Ti3C2Tx-Ni(OH)2-1 as shown in the Figure 2c. The high-resolution XPS spectra of C1s are fitted with three different peaks for Ti3C2Tx, Ti3C2Tx-Ni(OH)2-1, and Ti3C2Tx-Ni(OH)2-4 composite. For Ti3C2T<sup>x</sup> (Figure 2d) and Ti3C2Tx-Ni(OH)2-1 (Figure S4b, Supporting Information), the binding energy at 281.5, 284.4, and 285.8 eV is supplementary to the Ti─C, C─C, and C═C, respectively.[73,74] The Ti3C2Tx-Ni(OH)2-4 displayed the binding energies at 281.3, 284.4, and 285.5 eV, which are similar to the pristine Ti3C2Tx. Figure 2e displays the O1s spectra of Ti3C2T<sup>x</sup> corresponding to 529.6 (Ti─O bonds), 531.1 (C─Ti─(OH)x), 532.2 (C═O), and 533.1 (H2O molecules present on the surface of the nanosheets), respectively.[60,73,75,76] The O1s spectra of Ti3C2Tx-Ni(OH)2-1 (Figure S4c, Supporting Information) and Ti3C2Tx-Ni(OH)2-4 (Figure 2e) exhibit a new peak related to 530.4 eV, which displays Ni─O bonding.[77] Ti3C2T<sup>x</sup> has surface terminations often represented by Tx, which may include O, F, or OH groups. The inclusion of a higher amount of Ni(OH)2 replaces or reacts with some of these surface groups. This substitution can lead to the removal of peaks and a decrease in the peak intensity associated with specific surface terminations. The XPS analysis reveals distinct peaks for the Ni2p core levels for Ti3C2Tx-Ni(OH)2-1 and Ti3C2Tx-Ni(OH)2-4 as observed the Figure S4d, Supporting Information, and Figure 2f with the Ni2p3/2 peak detected at 855.70 eV and the Ni2p1/2 peak at 873.32 eV characteristic of Ni<sup>2</sup><sup>þ</sup> oxidation state. Additionally, the spectrum exhibits analogous shake-up peaks at 861.36 and 879.22 eV, further confirming the occurrence of Ni2<sup>þ</sup> in the catalytic network. As the concentration of Ni(OH)2 increased from Ti3C2Tx-Ni(OH)2-1 to Ti3C2Tx-Ni(OH)2-4 composite, the intensity of Ni2p3/2 and Ni2p1/2 increased. These spectral features are indicative of the typical electronic environment of nickel in its divalent oxidation state, highlighting its incorporation into the materials structure and its active role in the catalytic system.[67,78,79] The slight peak shifting in the Ti3C2Tx-Ni(OH)2 binding energies confirms the robust electronic interaction between Ti3C2T<sup>x</sup> and Ni(OH)2.

The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis was conducted to regulate the surface characteristics of the as-developed electrocatalyst materials. Figure 3 displays the SEM micrograph images of Ti3C2T<sup>x</sup> alongside various ratios of Ti3C2Tx-Ni(OH)2 composite electrocatalysts. As compared to the MAX phase (Figure S5, Supporting Information), a different characteristic of morphology has been observed in Ti3C2T<sup>x</sup> because of the HF treatment

process. Throughout the chemical etching procedure, the Al layer was predominantly eliminated from the MAX phase, which prompted the morphology characterized by multilayered, accordion-like nanosheets.[80,81] The sheet-like morphology offers several advantages, including an increased specific surface area for electrochemical reactions and enhanced space for anchoring desired nanomaterials on its surface and between the layered sheets. Figure 3a1,a2 clearly illustrates the presence of multiple gaps between the sheet-like structures in Ti3C2Tx. The sheet-like morphology of Mxene has been effectively encapsulated by the nanostructure of Ni(OH)2 in Ti3C2Tx-Ni(OH)2-1, Ti3C2Tx-Ni(OH)2-2, Ti3C2Tx-Ni(OH)2-3, and Ti3C2Tx-Ni(OH)2-4 composites as revealed in Figure 3b1,b2, c1,c2, d1,d2 and e1,e2, respectively. In the composites, Ni(OH)2 appears as nanoparticles exhibiting irregular sizes and shapes, which are effectively distributed across the Ti3C2T<sup>x</sup> surface. Nonetheless, the amount of Ni(OH)2 anchored has shown considerable variation across the different composites. This phenomenon primarily emerged due to varying quantities of Ni precursor sources utilized during the preparation process. As the concentration of the Ni source increases alongside Ti3C2Tx, there has been a progressive increase in the formation of Ni(OH)2. At lower concentrations, Ni(OH)2 exhibits a uniform distribution across the surface and interlayers of Ti3C2Tx. However, a notable accumulation on the Ti3C2T<sup>x</sup> surface has been observed in the highest concentrations of the Ni(OH)2. Among the various combinations, the Ti3C2Tx-Ni(OH)2-4 exhibits a higher concentration of Ni(OH)2, which has been effectively distributed on the Ti3C2T<sup>x</sup> without notable aggregations. The increased existence of Ni(OH)2 in conjunction with Ti3C2T<sup>x</sup> can lead to improved catalytic activity by providing a greater quantity of active sites for interaction with the electrolyte solution, thereby benefiting electrochemical performance. Consequently, the Ti3C2Tx-Ni(OH)2-4 has been further examined to assess the additional characteristic properties. Energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (EDAX) mapping analysis was employed to further validate the uniformity of Ti3C2T<sup>x</sup> and Ni(OH)2 within the composite. As revealed in Figure 3f1–f6, the distribution of Ti, C, F, O, and Ni elements has been identified. The mapping results confirm that Ni and O have been distributed across the entire surface. The identical dissemination of Ni(OH)2 on the Ti3C2T<sup>x</sup> surface has been successfully confirmed, which can significantly enhance catalytic reactions and improve electrocatalytic performance.

A high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) study was employed to further assess the homogeneity,

size, and distribution of Ni(OH)2 on Ti3C2Tx. Figure 4a1,a2 and b1–b3 illustrate the HRTEM images of Ti3C2T<sup>x</sup> and Ti3C2Tx-Ni(OH)2-4 composite electrocatalysts, respectively. A multilayered structure has been achieved in the case of Ti3C2Tx. The sheet-like structures of Ti3C2T<sup>x</sup> are interconnected with each other. The surface appearance of Ti3C2T<sup>x</sup> in Ti3C2Tx-Ni(OH)2-4 has been significantly modified following the incorporation of Ni(OH)2, as shown in Figure 4b1–b3. The distribution of nanosized Ni(OH)2 across the entire surface of Ti3C2T<sup>x</sup> in Ti3C2Tx-Ni(OH)2 is highly uniform and effective. On the surface of Ti3C2Tx, ≈6 nm-sized NNi(OH)2 particles have been eventually anchored. In order to improve the understanding of the uniformity of Ni(OH)2 and Ti3C2T<sup>x</sup> within the Ti3C2Tx-Ni(OH)2-4 composite, EDAX mapping and spectra were obtained. EDAX spectra and mapping results exposed the attendance of Ti, C, F, O, and Ni components in the Ti3C2Tx-Ni(OH)2-4 electrocatalyst. The EDAX mapping (Figure 4c1–c7) results successfully confirm the excellent distribution of Ni across the overall surface of the Ti3C2Tx. The identical distribution of Ni(OH)2 on Ti3C2T<sup>x</sup> facilitates strong interconnection, significantly enhancing the synergistic effects that improve properties during electrocatalytic performance. According to the EDAX spectra (Figure S6, Supporting Information), the weight percent of Ni element in the Ti3C2Tx-Ni(OH)2 composite is significant. The notably increased quantity of Ni(OH)2 in the composite as an electrocatalyst could significantly improve the electrocatalytic performance, particularly in the OER. Furthermore, the attachment of Ni(OH)2 nanoparticles onto the layered sheets can enhance the electrocatalytic active surface area and possibly enhance ion diffusion throughout electrochemical reactions.

The preliminary electrochemical performance of the developed electrocatalyst materials was evaluated by a conventional three-electrode system. The specified quantity of as-prepared active materials, along with binder and conductive carbon, was applied to the CC and regarded as a working electrode. The Pt plate and Hg/HgO were used as counter and reference electrodes, respectively. The N2 saturated 1M KOH solution was utilized as an electrolyte for measuring all the electrochemical performances. The initial assessment of linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) performance aimed to elucidate the OER performance for each electrocatalyst. Figure 5a represents the LSV polarization curves of Ti3C2T<sup>x</sup> and different ratios of Ti3C2Tx-Ni(OH)2 composite electrocatalysts. In the case of Ti3C2T<sup>x</sup> as an alone electrocatalyst, no considerable electrochemical OER performances are provided. The negligible electrocatalytic performance of Ti3C2T<sup>x</sup> likely resulted from layer restacking induced by van der Waals forces and instability under oxidative conditions.[34,75,82] Nonetheless, the performance of Ti3C2T<sup>x</sup> may be enhanced through surface modification and the integration of various electrocatalytic properties of materials.[34] Similarly, the performance of Ti3C2T<sup>x</sup> has been significantly enhanced following the incorporation of Ni(OH)2 on the surface of Ti3C2T<sup>x</sup> as a composite. The electrocatalytic performance of the Ti3C2Tx-Ni(OH)2 composite has shown considerable variation due to alterations in the Ni(OH)2 content within the composite assembly. Increasing the Ni(OH)2 amount in the composite leads to a notable enhancement in OER activity, as illustrated in Figure 5a. Among the various electrocatalysts explored in the current studies, the Ti3C2Tx-Ni(OH)2-4 demonstrated outstanding OER activity by exhibiting a lower overpotential. The observed overpotential at 10 mA cm<sup>2</sup> is 448, 285.17, 286.64, and 235.54 mV for Ti3C2Tx-Ni(OH)2-1, Ti3C2Tx-Ni(OH)2-2, Ti3C2Tx-Ni(OH)2-3, and Ti3C2Tx-Ni(OH)2-4 electrocatalysts, respectively. The enriched OER performance of Ti3C2Tx-Ni(OH)2-4 may be ascribed to the homogeneous interconnection between Ti3C2T<sup>x</sup> and Ti3C2Tx-Ni(OH)2, which facilitates a synergistic effect and improves electron transfer properties alongside the intrinsic OER activity. To enhance the understanding of the impact and mechanism of the electrocatalysts, the Tafel slope, EIS, and ECSA were assessed. Figure 5b represents the Tafel slopes results of the Ti3C2Tx-Ni(OH)2-1, Ti3C2Tx-Ni(OH)2-2, Ti3C2Tx-Ni(OH)2-3, and Ti3C2Tx-Ni(OH)2-4 electrocatalysts. Among the different electrocatalysts, the proficient result was attained for the Ti3C2Tx-Ni(OH)2-4, where the lower Tafel slope value was attained. The determined Tafel slope of Ti3C2Tx-Ni(OH)2-1, Ti3C2Tx-Ni(OH)2-2, Ti3C2Tx-Ni(OH)2-3, and Ti3C2Tx-Ni(OH)2-4 was 78.78, 73.54, 54.91, and 35.71 mV dec<sup>1</sup> respectively. The findings validate that enhanced OER reaction

kinetics have been achieved with the Ti3C2Tx-Ni(OH)2-4 electrocatalyst. To further validate the reaction processes, EIS analysis was conducted. The Nyquist plots of different electrocatalysts and their corresponding equivalent circuit diagrams are shown in Figure 5c and Figure S7, Supporting Information. The charge transfer properties of the electrocatalyst materials have been comprehended by determining the charge transfer resistance (Rct) throughout the electrochemical process. The Rct values of the Ti3C2Tx-Ni(OH)2-1, Ti3C2Tx-Ni(OH)2-2, Ti3C2Tx-Ni(OH)2-3, and Ti3C2Tx-Ni(OH)2-4 are 36.97, 31.11, 28.38, and 25.08 Ω, respectively. The Ti3C2Tx-Ni(OH)2-4 electrocatalyst exhibited a lower Rct, indicating its superior charge transfer capabilities during electrochemical performance. Moreover, the established turnover frequency findings (Figure 5d) validate the greater performance of the Ti3C2Tx-Ni(OH)2-4 electrocatalyst, which may facilitate efficient oxygen molecule generation.

The availability of the electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) in the composite is a crucial aspect for achieving an effective electrocatalyst. The ECSA of the Ti3C2Tx-Ni(OH)2-1, Ti3C2Tx-Ni(OH)2-2, Ti3C2Tx-Ni(OH)2-3, and Ti3C2Tx-Ni(OH)2-4 was measured using CV analysis. As shown in Figure S8, Supporting Information, the CV characteristic performance was conducted at numerous scan rates (5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 mV s<sup>1</sup> ). According to the CV results, the 2Cdl, Cdl, and ECSA were determined as represented in Figure S9, Supporting Information, Figure 5e, and Figure 5f, respectively. As compared to the lower concentration of Ni(OH)2 in the composite, the higher concentration of Ti3C2Tx-Ni(OH)2-4 showed higher Cdl values. The determined Cdl values are 1.2, 2.3, 2.375, and 2.925 mF cm<sup>2</sup> for Ti3C2Tx-Ni(OH)2-1, Ti3C2Tx-Ni(OH)2-2, Ti3C2Tx-Ni(OH)2-3,and Ti3C2Tx-Ni(OH)2-4 electrocatalysts, respectively. The integration of Ni(OH)2 into Ti3C2T<sup>x</sup> has significantly improved the Cdl. In a similar manner, the ECSA value shows a notable enhancement when Ni(OH)2 is incorporated as a composite with Ti3C2Tx. On the surface of Ti3C2Tx, the nanosized Ni(OH)2 provides higher active regions for electrocatalyst– electrolyte interaction, which influences to attain the higher ECSA for the composites. The demonstrated synergistic impact of increased ECSA and reduced charge transfer resistance in the Ti3C2Tx-Ni(OH)2 electrocatalyst is the key reason for its effective OER performance. The as-prepared electrocatalyst showed comparable performance as compared to the recently reported electrocatalysts (Table S1, Supporting Information) in the Ti3C2Txbased and Ni(OH)2-based electrocatalyst materials.

To acquire a deeper understanding of the reliability of the Ti3C2Tx-Ni(OH)2 electrocatalyst, the stability analysis was assessed through three efficient approaches. Initially, the stability of the electrocatalyst was measured before and after CV cycle analysis. The 5000 CV cycles were conducted at a scan rate of 50 mV s<sup>1</sup> . Figure 6a illustrates the LSV graph obtained prior to and following 5000 CV cycles. The figure illustrates that the LSV performance remains closely comparable prior to and following stability measurements. The minor variation in overpotential likely arises from the development of less conductive oxide layers, which can modify the electrocatalytic activity through decreasing electron transfer.[83,84] The characteristic polarization curves demonstrate significant stability for the Ti3C2Tx-Ni(OH)2 electrocatalysts following a substantial number of CV cycles. The extended period accelerated stability of Ti3C2Tx-Ni(OH)2-4 electrocatalyst was verified through chronopotentiometry (CP) at 10 mA cm2 . Figure 6b illustrates the CP results of the Ti3C2Tx-Ni(OH)2-4 electrocatalyst over a duration of 24 h. The CP results confirm the consistent performance of the electrocatalyst, with Ti3C2Tx-Ni(OH)2-4 demonstrating significant activity and minimal degradation after 24 h. However, a minor decline in performance has been observed after a certain duration, probably attributable to the inhibiting reaction between the electrode and electrolyte due to the unanticipated occurrence of oxygen molecules on the surface of the electrode. The existence of adsorbed oxygen

molecules on electrode surfaces can obstruct catalytic sites, leading to a decrease in reactive surface area, which may contribute to an increase in potential. Moreover, the multistep CP analysis (Figure 6c) was performed at different current densities from 10 to 120 mA cm<sup>2</sup> . An almost constant potential has been achieved at each stage of CP. The findings demonstrated that the Ti3C2Tx-Ni(OH)2-4 showed remarkable stability across various applied current densities, suggesting the possibility for applications requiring long-term durability. Figure 6d1–d4 represents the SEM micrograph images before and after CV stability performances of the Ti3C2Tx-Ni(OH)2-4 containing electrode. The surface morphology is closely similar to the freshly prepared Ti3C2Tx-Ni(OH)2-4 electrode and after LSV/5000 CV cycles/LSV stability performances. As a result, it can be inferred that the effective interaction between Ti3C2T<sup>x</sup> and Ni(OH)2 results in enhanced stability throughout prolonged operations. To substantiate the proposed mechanism, following the stability test, a comprehensive structural and chemical analysis was conducted using XRD, Raman, and XPS. These characterization techniques provided critical insights into the phase transformation, chemical bonding alterations, and oxidation state changes occurring within the Ti3C2Tx-Ni(OH)2-4 composite poststability evaluation. Figure S10a, Supporting Information, represents the after stability XRD spectra, which confirm that the diffraction peaks of Ti3C2T<sup>x</sup> and Ni(OH)2 are moderately retained, indicating the preservation of their structural integrity. Additionally, new diffraction peaks appear at 25.9°, 37.57°, and 41.15°,which can be distinctly attributed to the NiOOH phase.[85] Raman spectra of after stability Ti3C2Tx-Ni(OH)2-4 show the preservation of all the peaks as demonstrated in Figure S10b, Supporting Information. The deconvoluted Ti2p spectra (Figure S10c, Supporting Information) show the binding energies related to the Ti─C bonding, and Ti<sup>2</sup><sup>þ</sup> completely vanishes after the stability test.[86] As shown in the Figure S10d, Supporting Information, the C1s spectra also show the absence of Ti─C bond in the high resolution after stable Ti3C2Tx-Ni(OH)2-4 XPS spectra. The deconvoluted O1s spectra exhibit the negative shifting of Ni─O bonding from 530.4 to 530.0 eV, as shown in Figure S10e, Supporting Information. This confirms the formation of NiOOH phase after the stability test of Ti3C2Tx-Ni(OH)2-4. Figure S10f, Supporting Information, presents the deconvoluted Ni2p spectra, which conform to the transformation of Ni2<sup>þ</sup> to Ni3þ. These results suggest the production of NiOOH species due to the oxidation of Ni2<sup>þ</sup> to Ni3þ. [87,88] This phase is widely recognized for its advantageous role in water oxidation primarily due to its structural configuration, which incorporates a high concentration of Ni ions in elevated valence states as well as its half-metallic properties.[89] Figure 6e exhibits the possible reaction mechanism of Ti3C2Tx-Ni(OH)2 for OER. Consequently, it has been demonstrated that the Ti3C2Tx-Ni(OH)2 catalyst developed in this work can be regarded as a highly promising choice for enhanced performance in electrocatalysis for real device systems. The inadequate catalytic performance of Ti3C2T<sup>x</sup> MXene can be primarily attributed to the aggregation and stacking of its nanosheet layers. The stacking arrangement diminishes interlayer spacing, which obstructs the transport of electrolyte ions and limits access to active sites, consequently leading to a decrease in catalytic efficiency. Robust van der Waals interactions coupled with restricted spacing hinder ion diffusion and electron transfer. The limited ionic mobility results in insufficient ion-exchange kinetics, which are essential for the OER and the adsorption/desorption processes of intermediates like OH and OOH. As a result, there is a significant decline in the ECSA, which leads to a decrease in the overall current density observed during OER measurements.[34,46,82] In the electrochemical process, Ni(OH)2 transforms into the NiOOH phase. During the reaction, the oxidation state of nickel rises, allowing the Ni sites to promote the creation of OOHads intermediate species. These intermediates play a crucial role in the OER pathway. Subsequently, the NiOOH species reacts with adsorbed OH, leading to the release of O2 gas and completing the catalytic cycle. This process demonstrates the crucial function of NiOOH in improving OER kinetics by stabilizing and converting essential intermediates.[90–92]

The validation of the reliability and performance of the Ti3C2Tx-Ni(OH)2-4 electrocatalyst was conducted using a two-electrode configuration, as illustrated in Figure 7a, for the water-splitting process. The electrodes Ti3C2Tx-Ni(OH)2-4 and Pt/C were configured as anode and cathode in an asymmetric arrangement. The evaluation was conducted in a 1 M KOH electrolyte solution. As shown in Figure 7b, the cell comprising Ti3C2Tx-Ni(OH)2-4 exhibited a cell voltage of 1.7 V at 10 mA cm<sup>2</sup> current density. The results confirm the high efficacy of the Ti3C2Tx-Ni(OH)2-4 electrocatalyst in reducing the overpotential for an efficient water-splitting process. The enhanced number of active sites and improved diffusion within the composite electrode contribute to the effective water-splitting performance of Ti3C2Tx-Ni(OH)2-4. Moreover, the creation of a synergistic effect by the Ti3C2Tx-Ni(OH)2-4 leads to the tremendous performances. The CP test was established to measure the stability of Ti3C2Tx-Ni(OH)2-4 electrocatalyst. Figure 7c represents the CP results of Ti3C2Tx-Ni(OH)2-4 electrocatalyst for 18 h. Notably, the cell performance is more stable as illustrated in Figure 7c. Consequently, it can be assumed that the effective contact between Ti3C2T<sup>x</sup> and Ni(OH)2 contributes to enhanced stability during prolonged operations. As displayed in Figure 7d, Ti3C2Tx-Ni(OH)2 may provide a number of potential benefits when used as an electrocatalyst for water-splitting applications. Initially, the individual intrinsic properties of the Ti3C2T<sup>x</sup> and Ni(OH)2 aid to attaining the efficient electrochemical performances. The Ti3C2T<sup>x</sup> provides multiple benefits during the electrocatalyst preparation, specifically the ability to regulate the aggregation of Ni(OH)2 and the facilitation of a greater loading of Ni(OH)2 on the surface. During the process of composite formation, the occurrence of surface functional groups in Ti3C2T<sup>x</sup> has the ability to exert control on the agglomeration of nanosized Ni(OH)2. The Ti3C2T<sup>x</sup> has a sheetlike arrangement, which results in a high specific surface area. This allows for a greater quantity of nano Ni(OH)2 to efficiently develop on the surface as well as between each layer. The excellent interconnection and homogeneity between the Ti3C2T<sup>x</sup> and Ni(OH)2 shows synergy, which is the key reason for attaining the excellent electrocatalytic performances for Ti3C2Tx-Ni(OH)2 during the water splitting performances. The employment of Ni(OH)2 as an electrocatalyst together with Ti3C2T<sup>x</sup> can provide noteworthy characteristics properties such as improved electrochemically active surface area and electron transfer. These phenomenon helps in higher

conductivity, providing the more active sites and lowering the reaction barrier during the electrochemical performances. Thus, it can be concluded that the Ti3C2Tx-Ni(OH)2 showed considerable electrocatalytic OER performances. Moreover, the additional modification in this combination and structure can effectively function as an outstanding electrocatalyst material for the overall watersplitting process.

# 4. Conclusion

In summary, the research study validates the facile preparation of Ti3C2T<sup>x</sup> and Ni(OH)2 composite. The high-performance ratio of Ti3C2T<sup>x</sup> MXenes and Ni(OH)2 was successfully optimized via introducing the different concentrations of Ni(OH)2 together with Ti3C2T<sup>x</sup> in Ti3C2Tx-Ni(OH)2. The XRD, Raman, and XPS analyses were studied to verify the effective development and uniformity of the as-developed materials. The sheet-like structure of Mxene has been successfully encapsulated by the nanostructure of Ni(OH)2 in Ti3C2Tx-Ni(OH)2 composites to a great extent. The identical dispersion of nanosized Ni(OH)2 particles on the Ti3C2T<sup>x</sup> surface has the potential to greatly enhance catalytic reactions and boost electrocatalytic performance. For Ti3C2Tx-Ni(OH)2-1, Ti3C2Tx-Ni(OH)2-2, Ti3C2Tx-Ni(OH)2-3,and Ti3C2Tx-Ni(OH)2-4, the measured overpotential at 10 mA cm<sup>2</sup> is 448, 285.17, 286.64, and 235.54 mV, respectively. The Ti3C2Tx-Ni(OH)2-4 demonstrated better OER activity by displaying a decreased overpotential. Moreover, the outcomes suggest that the Ti3C2Tx-Ni(OH)2-4 electrocatalyst has improved the kinetics of OER reactions. The enriched OER performance of Ti3C2Tx-Ni(OH)2-4 may be attributed to the uniform interaction between Ti3C2T<sup>x</sup> and Ti3C2Tx-Ni(OH)2, which promotes a synergistic effect and enhances electron transport characteristics in conjunction with the inherent OER activity. The effective interaction between Ti3C2T<sup>x</sup> and Ni(OH)2 suggests an improvement in stability during extended operations. The cell using Ti3C2Tx-Ni(OH)2-4 electrocatalyst demonstrated a voltage of 1.7 V at a 10 mA cm<sup>2</sup> current density. The employment of Ni(OH)2 as an electrocatalyst in conjunction with Ti3C2T<sup>x</sup> may provide significant features, including enhanced electrochemically active surface area and electron transfer efficiency. Therefore, it can be concluded that Ti3C2Tx-Ni(OH)2 exhibited significant electrocatalytic performance for the OER.

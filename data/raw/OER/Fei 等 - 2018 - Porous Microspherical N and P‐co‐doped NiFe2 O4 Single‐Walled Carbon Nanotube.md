Electrocatalytic splitting of water into hydrogen and oxygen is 7 widely regarded as a promising approach for production of sustainable, secure, and clean hydrogen-fuel energy.[1] As hation of the splitting process, OER has led to many studies in reception years, and encountered a major bottleneck due to the sluggist1 kinetics, large overpotential and slow transfer rate of electrons. 62Currently, RuO2 and IrO2 are known to be the efficient OER3 catalysts. However, their widely application have to face several4 challenges because of their scarcity and price. [3] Therefore, 105 achieve high efficient OER catalysts based on earth-abundant metals is highly desirable but remain challenging.

Recently, transition-metal-based catalysts, such as Ni, C68 Mn and Fe, have attracted interest owing to their low cost and high catalytic activity. Among them, the Nickel iron bimetalling oxide catalytsts exhibit superior catalytic performance for the 1 OER.[4] It was demonstrated in a number of studies that showed the enhancement of OER activity can be achieved with 3 ferronickel metallic oxide. [5] Compared with the oxygen evolution 4 performance of metal oxides, the nickel oxide or iron oxide is not the best candidate. Consenquently, large amounts of articles were published to consider what kind of metal oxide was the most outstanding OER catalyst. Surprisingly, Li, X. et al. reported the Nickel-iron oxides are the most active electrocatalysts in the non-precious metal catalysts for the OER.[6a] It was concluded that a 500-fold OER activity enhancement can be achieved with mixed (Ni, Fe) oxyhydroxides over their pure Ni and Fe parent compounds. [5c, <sup>6b]</sup> Trace amounts of iron was added to the nickel oxide, which changed the internal structure and formed short Fe-O bond. The Fe-O bind energy is exactly near optimal adsorption energies of OER intermediates, which is why the ferronickel bimetallic oxide have better oxygen evolution performance than any other transition metal oxide. [5b] Besides, heteroatoms doping have been discovered to be a promising route to further improve the electrochemical performance, such as N (nitrogen) and P (phosphorous), which can enhance the electrocatalytic performance and alter the surface electronic performance.[7] Furthermore, chai's work reported that the OER activity of P and N codoped catalysts originates from the P-N bond. Therefore, simultaneous doping of N and P is very important.[8] Although the ferronickel bimetallic oxide shows excellent performance in the OER, its poor electrical conductivity and large volume expansion result in low utilization and structure instability during the electrochemical process. [9a] Therefore, it is necessary to design the material structure and make it combine with the highly conductive materials, such as SWNTs (Single-Walled Carbon Nanotubes). Besides, SWNTs also can prevent the flower-like porous microspheres from agglomeration during the reaction, make the spherical not deform and increase the stability of catalysts.

Herein, we reported a method for the synthesis of flowerlike spherical particles NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, and then N and P were codoped into the NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> to increase active sites by calcination. Further, SWNTs was combined with the NP-NiFe2O4 by ultrasonic to increase material conductivity and stability. Based on the porous structure, multiple active sites, high conductivity, the NP-NiFe2O4/SWNTs shows excellent OER activity with small overpotential of 247 mV at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> and low Tafel slope of 83.6 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>.

#### **Results and Discussion**

80 NP-NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/SWNTs was obtained by using hydrothermal 81 process, calcination and sonication (as shown in Scheme 1). 82 The divalent iron ions, divalent nickel ions and terephthalic acid

84 dimethylformamide (5 mL), acetone (5 mL) and deionized water 85 (5 mL) by continuously stirring for 0.5 h. And then the solution

was added into a Teflon-lined stainless steel, a flower-like

precursor was formed during the hydrothermal reaction, which was further calcined to form a new porous spherical flower-like particles, N and P were introduced at the same time. At last, the porous spherical particles were mixed with SWNTs using high-power ultrasound to generate a high-performance oxygen evolution catalyst.

Figure 1 shows the XRD pattern of the as-prepared NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, NP-NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> and NP-NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/SWNTs with three diffraction 3 peaks. The peaks are indexed to the (311), (511) and (44 $\hat{Q}$ planes of NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> cubic crystal structure (JCPDS 88-0380-1). 35 is obvious that the full width at half maximum of the (311) diffraction peak in NP-NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> is wider than NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>. According to the Scherrer equation, the lattice of NP-NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> is smaller indicating the successful doping of N and P, which reduced M (Ni, Fe)-O bond lengths. Meanwhile, a new peak was observed at 43.45° of NP-NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, which is ascribed to the (111) plane of metallic nickel system. It demonstrated the presence of nickel. is because the sodium hypophosphite generated phosphine. And the phosphine would reduce the nickel oxide to metallize nickel during the calcination process. The conclusion can also be supported by the XPS date. Furthermore, the observation of \_ a carbon reflection at 26.3° of NP-NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/SWNTs indicated that NP-NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> was successfully hybrid with SWNTs.

For further analysis of the materials, the morphologies and structures of the as-prepared NiFe2O4, NP-NiFe2O4 and NP-NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/SWNTs were investigated by the scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The SEM images of NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (Figure 2a-c) clearly show the formation of flower-like spherical particles with a large quantity of micropores appeared on the petals, which is due to the impact of nitrogen flow. After codoping of N and P atoms, the surface of microspheres becomes a more hierarchical and porous architectures to introduce abundant active sites (Figure 2d-f). Figure 2g-i show that NP-NiFe2O4 was homogeneously covered by SWNTs, which form a carbonic mesh shell outside the NP-NiFe2O4 microspheres. The mesh shell contributes to the enhancement of conductivity and stability of the microspherical catalyst. The flower-like morphology can enhance the activity of catalysts, which is also proved by Ge, J. [9b] The elemental EDX mapping reveals the evenly distributed of the C, Ni, Fe, N, P and O (Figure 2j-o), and the doping of N and P can be also confirmed (Figure 2m, n). Besides, in order to clearly show the defined structure of NP-NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/SWNTs, the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of NP-NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/SWNTs have been obtained in Figure 3. A smoky shell around 0.2 µm is distinctly observed coating the microspheres of NP-NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>. That should be assigned to the SWNTs network covered closely, which can significantly strengthen the stability of the catalyst and enhance the transition of the electrolyte to improve the electric catalytic activity.

X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) measurements were 5 used to further investigate the surface chemical composition and 6 electronic structures of NP-NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/SWNTs. The XPS shows 7 the presence of C 1s (a), O 1s (b), Ni (c), Fe (d), N(e), C (f) and 8 P (a). The C 1s spectra of NP-NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/SWNTs could be 6 deconvoluted into five peaks at binding energies of 284.6 (C=C) e 1285.2 (C-N), 285.6 (C-P), 284.26 (C-C) and 288.6 (O-C=O) e 11 (Figure 4a). It can be seen that the successful combination of 2 nitrogen and phosphorus with SWNTs. The O1s XPS spectra

could be deconvoluted into three peaks at binding energies of 530.3 (O1), 531.1 (O2) and 532.24 (O3) eV (Figure 4b). The O1 corresponds to metal oxygen bond. The well-resolved O2 can be attributed to the surface oxygen vacancies, which can significantly accelerate the kinetics of OER to enhance catalytic performance.[1b, 12] The O3 is associated with absorbed water and hydroxyl groups. In the high-resolution of Ni 2p spectra (Figure 4c), the peaks at 855.5 and 872.9 eV as well as 861 and 880 eV are attributed to the Ni 2p3/2 and Ni 2p1/2 signals of Ni2+ species respectively. The other two peaks located at binding energy of 852.29 and 868 eV, which are assigned to the peak of Ni 2p<sub>3/2</sub> and Ni 2p<sub>1/2</sub> of Ni<sup>0</sup> species.<sup>[10]</sup> The exist of Ni<sup>0</sup> is in good agreement with the XRD result that a new peak appeared at 43.45°. Figure 4d shows the peaks at 724.32 and 710.99 eV corresponding to Fe 2p<sub>3/2</sub> and Fe 2p<sub>1/2</sub>, which suggests the +3 oxidation state of iron.[11] The peak at 707.5 eV (Figure 4d) comes from Fe in phosphide, which is corresponded to the peak at 128.89 eV (Figure 4f). It suggested the existence of Fe-P. The peak at 715.2 eV (Figure 4d) comes from Fe in nitrogen, which is corresponded to the peak at 396.9 eV (Figure 4e). It suggested the existence of Fe-N. The N1s spectra is deconvoluted into four peaks as Fe-N (396.9 eV) bond, pyridinic (398.56 eV), pyrrolic (399.6 eV) and oxidized (401.8 eV) and (Figure 4e).[13] Figure 4f demonstrates the existence of the P-N bond (133.7 eV) apart from the P-O (134.51 eV) bond, P-C (132.77 eV) bond and Fe-P (128.89 eV) bond.[14] Therefore, the XPS spectrum of C 1s (a), Ni 2p (b), Fe 2p (c) and O 1s (d) for NP-NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/SWNTs and NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/SWNTs was investigated to analyse whether the N and P affect the properties of SWNTs or the properties of NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> in Figure S2. It can be found out that that the C-N and C-P was formed after dopping N and P on SWNTs, and the OER performance of SWNTs was optimized by formation of C-N and C-P, which is due to C-N and C-P can enhances the catalytic activity by lowering the oxygen adsorption energy, better conductivity, and further facilitates the reaction by increasing the percentage of catalytically active site in SWNTs. In addition, the Fe-N and Fe-P in NP-NiFe2O4/SWNTs exhibited an improved OER activity and a superior stability in an alkaline solution. It can be concluded that the N and P have a great affect on SWNT and NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, which can significantly improve the OER performance.

Electrocatalytic properties of the NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, NP-NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> and NP-NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/SWNTs hybrids towards OER have been investigated in 1.0 M KOH. The linear scan voltammogram (LSV) curves in Figure 5a demonstrated the high-performance of the NP-NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/SWNTs with the lowest overpotential of 247 mV at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, which is much smaller than those of NP-NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (359 mV), NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (419 mV), SWNTs (386 mV) and RuO<sub>2</sub> (274 mV). The effect of SWNTs is shown in Figure 5a, which is apparent to improve the OER performance of NP-NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>. Similarly, the role of N and P on the OER performance was also explored. The NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/SWNTs, N-NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/SWNTs and P-NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/SWNTs have been synthesized and compared with NP-NiFe<sub>2</sub>O4/SWNTs in Figure S1, which demonstrated the OER performance of NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/SWNTs has been already improved significantly by doping either N or P, which leads to the asymmetric 3d electronic structure for enhanced OER

performance. However, the NP-NiFe $_2$ O $_4$ /SWNTs still show the lower overpotential than those of N-NiFe $_2$ O $_4$ /SWNTs and fl-7 NiFe $_2$ O $_4$ /SWNTs, which demonstrates simultaneous doping of lN8 and P can further improve the OER activity through the P-lN9 bonds. The Tafel slope of NP-NiFe $_2$ O $_4$ /SWNTs is only 83.6 m $_2$ 0 dec $_1$  (Figure 5b), which is also better than RuO $_2$ 1 Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) results (Figure 5c) reveal the faster kinetics of NP-NiFe $_2$ O $_4$ /SWNTs, with the charge transfer resistance of 5.021  $\Omega$ , which is much smalled than NP-NiFe $_2$ O $_4$  and NiFe $_2$ O $_4$ . LSV curves after 1000 cycles are presented in Figure 5d, showing hardly any change overpotential and current density. It suggests the excelled residually of NP-NiFe $_2$ O $_4$ /SWNTs, which is probably due to the outer shell of SWNTs. Afterwards, We have changed the amount of urea, NaH $_2$ PO $_2$  and SWNTs respectively to

synthesize various samples with different N/P/SWNTs contents to explore the performance of the NiFe $_2O_4$  hybrids in Figure S3. Figure S3a-c show the optimal OER performance is obtained with 100 mg NaH $_2$ PO $_2$  and 100mg urea added, and the ratio of 2:1 for NiFe $_2O_4$  to SWNTs. Figure S3d-i showed the SEM images of all the synthesized samples. When the NaH $_2$ PO $_2$  and urea are less than 100 mg, the performances will be degraded, which might be due to the insufficient active sites formed from doping, whereas the structure of NiFe $_2O_4$  will be damaged on account of the excessive N and P. Similarly, the NiFe $_2O_4$  will not be covered completely by less SWNTs, which will result in the unsteady structure and insufficient conductivity, while the excessive SWNTs will obstruct the pathway of electrolyte, still resulting in an inferior OER performance.

The data 243 ECSA and specific capacitance have been summercised 24 Table S1. The results are consistent with the speculation abould 5 active sites, and this trend is the same as the electrochemic 26activity. It can be confirmed that the electrochemical activity 27 the samples are related to its ECSA. It further suggested that the electrochemical activity can be turned by controlling the ECS&9 The hierarchical and porous architecture of NP-NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>O increase the active sites and reduce the mass transfer1 resistance. The large surface area of the mixed SWNTs would 2 provide further support for the increasing active sites.

In order to get insight into the surface properties of the NP-NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/SWNTs to find the essential functional ingredients of catalysts. XPS, XRD and SEM were used to characterize the change of composition and structure after OER. The XPS shows the presence of C (a), O (b), Ni (c), Fe (d), N (e) and P (f) in Figure 7 after the OER. It can be observed from Figure 7a-b that there is little change of C 1s and O 1s after the OER, which indicates the reason why the OER performance is stable. The Ni 2p spectra shows the binding energy of 852.29 and 868 eV in the Ni 2p spectra of Ni<sup>0</sup> disappeared. It indicated the metallic nickel was oxideted to nickel-oxygen species during the OER. [22] The equation is:

The nickel-oxygen can adsorb hydroxyl favorably, provide active sites and accelerate the election transfer<sup>[23]</sup>. At the same time, the Fe-P and Fe-N is still observed in Figure 4d, which suggests there is a stronger electron coupling between N/P with Fe. In addition, the NP-NiFe2O4/SWNTs after the OER shows the slightly decreased N and P active sites of NP-NiFe2O4/SWNTs from the N 1s and P 2p spectrum (Figure 7e-f), and a little damaged crystallization from the XRD spectrum (Figure 7g). Thus, the catalyst can still maintain a steady performance, which is probably due to the robust protection and fast electron transfer of SWNTs outer shell (Figure 7h). The excellent OER performance of NP-NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/SWNTs was comparable with therecently reported Nickel-based catalysts, as summarized in Table 1. Specifically, the Pt/C||NP-NiFe2O4/SWNTs needs a cell voltage as low as 1.59 V to drive a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, which are far less than the 1.781 V of Pt/C||RuO<sub>2</sub> (Figure 8).

The superior catalytic performance of the NP-NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/SWNTs can be attributed to several synergistic factors. First, The porous nanoflowers structure enhances the transition of the electrolyte, promotes the electronic transmission, and improves the electric catalytic activity. Second, the SWNTs significantly improves the conductivity and strengthens the stability of the material. Third, the codoped N and P can increase the active sites and improve the catalytic activity.

#### **Conclusions**

A low-cost and facile approach has been developed for preparation of NP-NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/SWNTs microspheres as a high-performance oxygen evolution catalyst. Codoping of N and P increase the active sites, SWNTs enhances the conductivity,

and porous structure reduces mass transfer resistance. The 3 optimized NP-NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/SWNTs shows highly efficient for the 4 OER activity with an overpotential of 247 mV at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> and 5 a small Tafel slope of 83.6 mV dec<sup>-1</sup> in 1.0 M KOH. Further, NP 5 NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/SWNTs was applied as anode to electrolyze waters, 8 presenting a cell voltage of 1.595 V to achieve the water splitting current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. The results make NP NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/SWNTs a promising catalyst for OER. And it provides 6 specific strategy to increase conductivity and improve active 1 sites by designing the structures.

#### 12 Experimental Section

Reagent: Nickel nitrate hexahydrate, iron sulfate heptahydrate, r69 phthalic acid, urea, sodium hypophosphite and carbon nanotubes wer20 purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. 1.0 M solution of KOH was employed 31 a supporting electrolyte. All of the chemicals and reagents used f6/2 electrochemical measurements were analytical grade and used without further purification. The deionized water used for solution preparation was obtained from a Millipore Autopure system (18.2 MΩ, Millipore Ltd74 USA).

Characterization methods: The crystallographic structure of the 7 obtained material was determined by X-ray diffraction (XRI), 8 RigakuD/max-2400, USA), and the morphology was investigated by scanning electron microscope (SEM, Hitachi S-4800, Japan) and Transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Tecnai G2 F30, FEI, USA). 1 ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ESCALAB250xi, USA) was carrical out to analyze the composition and chemical configuration.

Synthesis of Porous spherical Ni-Fe oxide particles precursor: &4
first, 329.4 mg of FeSO<sub>4</sub>-7H<sub>2</sub>O, 328 mg of Ni(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>-6H<sub>2</sub>O, and 151.3 mg
of isophthalic acid (H<sub>2</sub>IPA) were dissolved in a mixture of DMF (5 mL)
acetone (5 mL) and deionized water to form a clear solution by ultrasonic
for 30 minutes. The solution was then transferred to a Teflon-lined
stainless-steel autoclave and keep at 160 °C for 4 h. After cooling 66
room temperature, the obtained Ni-Fe oxide particles precursors we 7
separated by centrifugation and washed with water and ethanol three
times. Finally the obtained solid samples were vacuum dried at 60 °C
overnight.

Synthesis of Porous spherical NP-NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> particles: The Ni-Fe oxide particles precursor was phosphated and nitrided by thermal decomposition of NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>2</sub> and urea under nitrogen flow. 100 n<sub>2</sub>O NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>2</sub> and 100 mg urea were put at the upstream of a ceramic boat, and 10 mg of Ni-Fe oxide particles precursor on the downstream. Theo 1 the samples were annealed at 500 °C for 2 h with a heating rate of 1 °C min<sup>-1</sup> under nitrogen atmosphere in the tube furnace. Porous spherical NP-NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> particles were obtained after cooling to ambient temperature under nitrogen. (The samples identified as N-X-NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> when the added urea is X mg, while the samples identified as P-Y-NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> when the 2dded NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>2</sub> is Y mg in Figure S2. The preparation method is the same.)

Synthesis of Porous spherical NiFe $_2$ O $_4$  oxide particles: The NiFe $_2$ O $_4$  was prepared by the same method with NP-NiFe $_2$ O $_4$  without NaH $_2$ PO $_2$  and urea.

Synthesis of Porous spherical NP-NiFe $_2$ O $_4$ /carbon nanotubes (NP-NiFe $_2$ O $_4$ /SWNTs): 2 mg sample of as-prepared NP-NiFe $_2$ O $_4$  and 1 mg SWNTs were dispersed in 1 mL dimethylformamide (DMF) using high-power ultrasound to form a dispersion. (The LSV curves and SEM images of different rate of NP-NiFe $_2$ O $_4$  and to SWNTs was compared in Figure S2)

**Electrochemical Measurements:** All the electrochemical measurements were carried out by using a CHI 660E electrochemical workstation (CHII instruments, Shanghai Chenhua Instrument Corp. China). In the conventional three-electrode system, glass carbon electrode (GCE) was used as the working electrode (the diameter of GCE: 3 mm and working electrode effective area: 0.071 cm²). A saturated Ag/AgCI electrode and a platinum wire were applied as the reference electrode and the counter electrode respectively. Before the modification, a GCE was polished with 0.05 mm α-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> powder, and then ultrasonically rinsed by ethanol, 0.5 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> and DI water, finally dried in air at room temperature. The catalyst solution was prepared by dispersing 2 mg of various catalysts into 1 mL DMF. 10 μL of the prepared catalyst film and dried under an infrared lamp.

All the electrochemical measurements were conducted in the 1.0 M KOH aqueous solution at room temperature. Before the OER measurement, the working electrode was activated by continuous scanning from 0 to 0.6 V in the potential window, the polarization curves were replotted as overpotential ( $\eta$ ) versus log current density (log j) to get Tafel plots. Through fitting the linear portion of the Tafel plots according to the Tafel equation ( $\eta$  = b log j + a), the Tafel slope (b) can be obtained. In 0.5 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, all results were calibrated with respect to reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) through E(RHE) = E(Ag/AgCl) + 0.198 V. Unless special mention, all data were reported with iR compensation.

**Calculation of ECSA:** Based on the linear fitting of Figure 5 insert, we can derive its specific capacitance as follows:

$$C = \frac{k}{2} \times \frac{1}{m}$$

where C is the specific capacitance of NP-NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/SWNTs, k is the fitting slope, m is the catalyst areal loading. Then, we can calculate its ECSA by assuming a standard value of  $60~\mu$ F/cm<sup>2</sup>:

$$ECSA = \frac{C}{60 \text{ uF/cm}^2}$$

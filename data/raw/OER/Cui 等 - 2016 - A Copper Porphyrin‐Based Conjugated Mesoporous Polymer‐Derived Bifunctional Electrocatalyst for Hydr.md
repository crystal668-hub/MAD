Scalable and robust catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) are required for the implementation of water splitting technologies as a globally applicable method of producing renewable hydrogen. Herein, we report nitrogen-enriched porous carbon materials containing copper/copper oxide, derived from copper porphyrin-based conjugated mesoporous polymers (CMPs), as a bifunctional catalyst for both HER and OER. These catalysts have a high surface area, unique tubular structure, and strong synergistic effect of copper/copper oxide and porous carbons, resulting in excellent performance for water splitting. Under optimal conditions, the catalyst exhibits a quite low overpotential for OER (350 mV to reach 1.0 mA cm-<sup>2</sup> and 450 mV to reach 10 mA cm-2 ) in alkaline media, which places it among the best copper-based water oxidation catalysts reported in the literature. Furthermore, the catalyst shows good catalytic activity for HER at a low overpotential (190 mV to reach 1.0 mA cm-2 ) as well as a high current density (470 mV to reach 50 mA cm-2 ). The results suggest that hybridized copper/carbon materials are attractive noble-metal-free catalysts for water splitting.

## Introduction

Recently, hydrogen production through water splitting has received increasing attention as an ideal, inexpensive, and renewable energy carrier for future energy supply.[1] The application of hydrogen in power sources can effectively address the increasing environmental issues accompanying the combustion of fossil fuels. In the past four decades, various catalysts have been developed for both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, the most efficient catalysts are still based on precious metals such as Pt,[2] Ru,[3] and Ir,[4] which are always more active than catalysts based on non-precious metals such as Co, Ni, and Fe.[1b, 5] Moreover, the sluggish kinetics of the OER involving a four-electron transfer process significantly hampers the overall water splitting reaction and OER is also closely associated with the catalytic efficiency of HER for overall water splitting using non-platinum catalysts.[5f, 6] A catalyst that can drive both HER/OER is highly desirable as it is a fundamental necessity of the important energy conversion process, that is, water splitting.[7] However, it is difficult to develop efficient and stable catalysts that can drive both OER and HER under a low overpotential for efficient overall water splitting.[8] For instance, the best catalysts for OER (RuO2and IrO2) showed poor HER activity, whereas the best HER catalysts (Pt and Pd) exhibited only moderate activity for OER.[5f, 9] One possible approach is to combine these metals/metal oxides on a conductive substrate as an efficient bifunctional catalyst for both HER and OER, but the high cost and low abundance of these metals may hamper their large practical applications.[10] Therefore, the development of low-cost and stable bifunctional catalyst with low overpotentials for both OER and HER reactions remains a significant challenge.

Copper (Cu) is an earth-abundant element and the second cheapest first-row transition metal. It has been widely used in copper-based catalysts for oxidizing organic compounds such as phenols, alcohols, and hydrocarbons.[11] Copper's high abundance, low toxicity, and rich redox properties render Cu-based catalysts as highly favorable for energy conversion applications. In 2014, our group reported that a heterogeneous copper oxide film electrodeposited from copper(II) tris(2-pyridylmethyl)amine complexes is an active catalyst for water oxidation.[12] Subsequent work using CuO synthesized from a simple copper salt showed that its catalytic activity could be tuned by modifying its size and morphology.[13] Furthermore, we also found that a CuII–ethylenediamine (Cu–EA) complex could be used as an excellent precursor to electrodeposit leaflike hierarchical Cu<sup>0</sup> material, which is robust and highly active for hydrogen production.[14] Using a series of organic copper complexes as the catalyst precursors, active bifunctional catalyst films were generated for both HER and OER, but only low performance was achieved (447 mV@-1.0 mA cm-<sup>2</sup> for HER; 720 mV@1.0 mA cm-<sup>2</sup> for OER).[15] Therefore, the development of abundant and active copper-based bifunctional catalysts for water splitting is still highly desired.

Conjugated mesoporous polymers (CMPs) are a novel class of polymeric materials with a micromesoporous structure and an extended network. [16] The advantages of CMPs include tunable porous structures, large surface areas, simple functionality, promising capacity for catalysis, and recyclability as a heterogeneous catalyst.[17] Therefore, CMP-based materials have drawn much attention for catalysis in recent years. The Jiang group reported the use of Fe-porphyrin CMPs for the catalytic oxidation of thioanisoles.[18] Feng, Müllen, and co-workers used cobalt porphyrin-based CMPs for high-performance oxygen reduction reaction.<sup>[19]</sup> Inspired by the studies of CMPs, herein we report a series of nitrogen-enriched porous carbon materials incorporated with copper nanoparticles, derived from copper porphyrin conjugated mesoporous polymers, as active electrocatalysts for both HER and OER. These materials possess large active surface areas and unique tubular structures and can efficiently accelerate the electrochemical processes. Under optimal conditions, the electrocatalyst exhibits a very low overpotential for OER (350 mV to reach 1.0 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>) and excellent current density (26 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> at an overpotential of 790 mV), which render the present material among the best copper-based catalysts for OER. In addition, a low overpotential can be achieved for HER (190 mV to reach 1.0 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>), as well as a high current density.

#### **Results and Discussion**

The Cu-CMP networks were synthesized using Yamamoto coupling of copper 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4'-bromophenyl) porphyrin complex, catalyzed by bis(1,5-cyclooctadiene)nickel (0) (Ni(COD)<sub>2</sub>) and 2,2'-bipyridyl in dry DMF (Figure 1 a), according to the method reported in the literature. Subsequently, thermal treatment of the Cu-CMP precursor at 600, 700, 800, 850, and 900 °C, yielded nitrogen-enriched porous carbon materials with the incorporation of copper nanoparticles, and these materials are denoted as Cu-CMP600, Cu-CMP700, Cu-CMP800, Cu-CMP850, and Cu-CMP900, respectively. The FTIR spectrum of Cu-CMP revealed the presence of a characteristic

N–Cu vibration band at 1004 cm<sup>-1</sup> and aromatic C–H stretching at 3432 cm<sup>-1</sup>, which was assigned to the phenyl ring between each Cu<sup>II</sup> porphyrin unit. The vibration band of the C–N bond at 965 cm<sup>-1</sup> for the porphyrin monomer disappeared in Cu<sup>II</sup> porphyrin and Cu-CMP, indicating the successful insertion of the Cu<sup>II</sup> into the porphyrin scaffolds. The vibration band of the C–Br bond at 1071 cm<sup>-1</sup> also diminished after coupling (Figure 1 b).<sup>[20]</sup> The XRD pattern showed the amorphous nature of the resulting Cu-CMP (Figure S3). The SEM images of the Cu-CMP displayed rod-like morphology with diameters of 0.5–2 µm and up to tens of micrometers in length in the hollow structure (Figure 2 a). The SEM images of the materials pyrolyzed from Cu-CMP still showed a regular rod-like structure with a length of up to tens of micrometers as well as a width

of up to 0.5–2 mm, which has no significant difference from the precursor. With increasing temperature, the wall of the hollow rod is ruptured and the degree of rupture increases (Figure 2 b–f). The rod structure of the materials derived from Cu-CMP is probably associated with the catalytic evolution of carbon materials caused by the reduced Cu<sup>0</sup> during the pyrolysis process.[21] Thermogravimetric analysis of Cu-CMP indicated that approximately 80.8% of its weight can be maintained after heating up to 8508C under nitrogen gas (Figure S4). All the results demonstrate that CuII porphyrin units are covalently integrated into the porous frameworks.

Given that the Cu-CMP frameworks possess a rigid conjugated backbone with a 1D rod-like architecture, this polymer precursor was subjected to template-free pyrolysis for the fabrication of porous nitrogen-enriched carbons integrated with copper. The catalyst materials were characterized by powder XRD (Figure 3). The broad peak at approximately 258 can be

assigned to graphitic carbon and the sharp peaks located at 2q of 43.28 and 50.38 correspond to the (111) and (200) planes of cubic Cu<sup>0</sup> (JCPDS card: 70-3038). The peak intensities of Cu0 are more pronounced at a higher temperature. Moreover, the peak intensity of carbon is weak at 8508C and 900 8C, indicating the high temperature can damage the long-range order of graphitic carbon.

The material was further studied by TEM, which confirmed the hollow architecture and that the copper nanoparticles were dispersed on the carbon matrix (Figure 4 a). High-resolution TEM (HR-TEM) confirmed the formation of the Cu<sup>0</sup> encapsulated within graphitic carbon shells with a highly crystalline (200) plane structure (Figure 4 b). Interestingly, copper nanoparticles were oxidized to copper oxide with a crystalline (110) plane on the surface. Therefore, this material can be used as a bifunctional catalyst for both water oxidation and reduction because of the presence of both copper oxide and copper (0).[12–14]

Nitrogen sorption analysis of Cu-CMP gave a high BET surface area of approximately 307 m2g-1 . Well-defined microporous structures with pore sizes of approximately 0.6 nm and 1.2 nm were obtained (Figures 5 a,b). After pyrolysis, the nitro-

gen adsorption analysis plot showed there was a smaller surface area for Cu-CMP850 (289 m2g-1 ) compared to Cu-CMP (Figure 5 c and d). The pore sizes changed to approximately 1.2, 2.8, and 5.2 nm for Cu-CMP850. The decrease in the surface area and the change in pore size distribution for Cu-CMP after pyrolysis can be attributed to the structural destruction and rearrangement of the Cu-CMP framework during the thermal carbonization process.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis revealed the presence of C 1s, N 1s, O 1s, and Cu 2p in Cu-CMP850 (Figure 6 a). Figure 6 b shows the high-resolution XPS spectra of Cu 2p. The binding energies of Cu 2p3/2 corresponded with two peaks located at 932.6 and 934.3 eV and the binding energies of Cu 2p1/2 showed two peaks at 952.4 and 953.9 eV. The

 $Cu\,2p_{1/2}$  binding energy at 952.4 eV and the  $Cu\,2p_{3/2}$  binding energy at 932.6 eV indicated the existence of Cu<sup>0,[22]</sup> In addition, the existence of CuO was confirmed by the binding energies of  $Cu 2p_{3/2}$  and  $Cu 2p_{1/2}$  located at 934.3 and 953.9 eV, respectively.<sup>[23]</sup> The formation of CuO was further proven by the O1s binding energy at 531.5 eV (Figure 6c). [22a,b,24] Moreover. the peak located at 532.7 eV was attributed to chemisorbed water, which is consistent with previous XPS studies.[22c, 25] The N1s spectra of Cu-CMP samples can be fitted to three different signals that correspond to overlapping pyridinic N and Cu-N bonding (398.5 eV, N1), graphitic N (401.1 eV, N2), and high oxidation states of the nitrogen atoms (401.8 eV, N3) (Figure 6 d). [26] Based on previous studies, [27] most of the Cu-N catalytic sites were probably composed of copper coordinated with pyridinic nitrogen at the edges of the nitrogen-doped carbon lattice.

Linear sweep voltammograms (LSVs) for HER in 1.0 м КОН solution were performed to further investigate the Cu-CMP600, Cu-CMP700, Cu-CMP800, Cu-CMP850, and Cu-CMP900 samples (Figure 7 a). From the LSV results the lowest potential with a current density of 1.0 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> for hydrogen production was observed at approximately -190 mV versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) for Cu-CMP850 (all the potentials are versus RHE in this paper). Gas bubbles were clearly observed on the electrode, which were confirmed to be hydrogen by gas chromatography. This observation also indicated that water reduction did take place during the cathodic scan. To reach 1.0 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, the potentials for Cu-CMP600, Cu-CMP700, Cu-CMP800, and Cu-CMP900 were approximately -300, -250, -240, and -300 mV, respectively. In sharp contrast, the Cu-CMP without thermal treatment showed much less catalytic activity for HER in 1.0 M KOH solution. Furthermore, to reach a higher catalytic current density at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, the required potential for Cu-CMP850 was approximately -350 mV, making it more active than Cu-CMP700 ( $\approx$  -430 mV), Cu-CMP800  $(\approx -380 \text{ mV})$ , and Cu-CMP900  $(\approx -430 \text{ mV})$ . Therefore, the Cu-

CMP850 has the best electrocatalytic activity for HER 1.0  $\mbox{\scriptsize M}$  KOH with the lowest overpotential for HER under the same current density.

The corresponding Tafel plots can be obtained based on the polarization curves (Figure 7b). The Tafel slope (b) reflects the catalytic activity in HER, which is determined by fitting the polarization data to the Tafel equation ( $\eta = V_{appl} - iR - E_{pH}$ , where  $\eta$ is the overpotential,  $V_{\rm appl}$  is the applied potential vs. Ag/AgCl, i is the stable current, R is the uncompensated resistance, and  $E_{\rm pH}$  is the thermodynamic potential for water reduction at this pH,  $E_{pH} = -0.059 \text{ pH} - E_{ref} \text{ V vs. RHE}$ ,  $E_{ref}$  is the potential of the reference electrode). The Tafel slopes for Cu-CMP600 and Cu-CMP700 are 407 and 167 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. The Tafel slopes of Cu-CMP800, Cu-CMP850, and Cu-CMP900 are almost the same ( $\approx 135 \text{ mV dec}^{-1}$ ). The Tafel slope of 135 mV dec<sup>-1</sup> is in close agreement with the theoretical Tafel slope (2.30RT/ $\alpha F$ ) if the Volmer reaction is the rate-limiting step.<sup>[28]</sup> The current value higher than 120 mV dec<sup>-1</sup> is probably caused by other side-reactions, such as the presence of some other electrochemical reactions for the reduction of the copper oxide at the surface and/or electrochemical absorption of the hydrogen. [28b] After heat treatment, Cu-CMP850 exhibited the highest HER activity with a small overpotential, high current density, and low Tafel slope of 135 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>. As shown in Table 1, this result is much better than the bifunctional catalyst film generated from a series of copper pyridyl-methylamine complexes, [15] which is also comparable to the leaf-like hierarchical Cu<sup>0</sup> material electrodeposited from Cu<sup>II</sup> ethylenediamine (Cu-EA) complex (Tafel slope: 127 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>, overpotential of 157 mV at 1.0 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>)<sup>[14]</sup> and ternary copper molybdenum

Inspired by a previous study of a Cu-based bifunctional catalyst,[15] the as-prepared Cu-CMP materials were also examined for catalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The LSVs were measured at 5 mV s-<sup>1</sup> at room temperature (RT) in 1.0m KOH (Figure 8 a). All the materials showed catalytic activity for OER.

To reach a catalytic current density of 1.0 mA cm-2 , Cu-CMP850 require the lowest potential at 1.58 V (an overpotential of 350 mV), whereas the required potentials for Cu-CMP600, Cu-CMP700, Cu-CMP800, and Cu-CMP900 were 1.66, 1.63, 1.59, and 1.61 V, respectively. It is not surprising that Cu-CMP achieves 1.0 mA cm-<sup>2</sup> under the highest overpotential of 1.69 V, indicating that the pyrolysis process has a positive effect on the OER catalysis. Since the Cu-CMP is an organic polymer material with relatively poor electronic conductivity, the pyrolysis process can improve its conductivity and subsequently enhance the catalytic properties. Under an applied potential of 1.8 V, Cu-CMP800 could reach a current density of 26 mA cm-2 , which is more than eight times higher than that of Cu-CMP (3.0 mA cm-2 ).

Furthermore, the current densities of the catalysts were measured as a function of the overpotential at a slow scan rate (5 mV s-1 ) (h=VappliR-EpH, EpH is the thermodynamic potential for water oxidation at this pH, EpH= 1.23 V-0.059 pH-Eref V vs. RHE). As shown in Figure 8 b, the Tafel slope is 62 mV/dec for Cu-CMP850, whereas the slope is 112 mV/dec for Cu-CMP. The Tafel slope of Cu-CMP850 is the lowest among all the present materials, confirming its highest catalytic activity for OER. An appreciable catalytic current was observed starting at h=300 mV, and a current density of approximately 1.0 mA cm-<sup>2</sup> required h=350 mV. This overpotential is much lower than Cu-based heterogeneous OER catalysts previously reported by our group[12, 13, 15, 30] and other groups.[31] A comparison of these results is shown in Table 2. This result is

consistent with the observation for HER, and the Cu-CMP850 was used in all the subsequent experiments. In addition, double layer capacitance (Cdl) was measured to evaluate the electrochemical surfaces area (ECSA) of the various catalysts. As shown in Figure S5, S6, and Table S1 (Supporting Information), the Cu-CMP850 exhibited the largest value of Cdl (11.1 mF), indicating high exposure of the catalytic active sites, which is probably responsible for the best electrocatalytic activity of Cu-CMP850. Besides, the Cu-CMP850 exhibited a prevailing catalytic activity than the previously reported Cu-based heterogeneous catalysts, which can probably be attributed to the following aspects: 1) The high surface area not only provides more catalytically active sites but also enhances the mass transport during electrochemical reactions. 2) The unique tubular hollow structure can provide excellent conductivity and remarkable corrosion resistance under a harsh operating environment. 3) Strong synergistic effect of copper/copper oxide and porous carbons. From the comparison in Table 1 and Table 2, the Cu-CMP850 showed better catalytic properties than that of the porous carbon and the individual Cu and CuO, which is probably owing to the strong synergistic effect of copper/ copper oxide and porous carbons, leading to an effective charge transfer process during electrocatalysis. 4) The carboncoated structure can greatly improve the electroconductivity of the material.

Based on the results in Figure S8 and Table S1, the catalytic activity of Cu-CMP850 is still lower than that of precious metalbased catalysts of Pt and IrO2. However, Cu is an earthabundant elements with quite a low cost, demonstrating its great potential for possible large scale practical applications. Moreover, the electrocatalytic activity of Cu-CMP850 is still less than those of Co-based,[7b, 8a, 10a] Ni-based,[32] and Fe-based[33] bifunctional electrocatalysts. Furthermore, for the tentative evaluation of the active sites for HER and OER, we synthesized the mesoporous carbon without Cu loading under the same conditions (H2-CMP850). We also treated the Cu-CMP850 with diluted HCl and FeCl3 aqueous solution to remove CuO and Cu<sup>0</sup> that are not coated with carbon (modified Cu-CMP850). Then, the LSVs of OER and HER were measured. As shown in Figure S8, H2-CMP850 showed no appreciable catalytic current for HER and OER, indicating that the carbon is not the active site for OER and HER. The modified Cu-CMP850 showed a much lower catalytic current than that of Cu-CMP850 for both HER and OER. Compared to H2-CMP850, the modified Cu-CMP850 showed moderate catalytic activity. Based on the above results, the Cu, CuO, and "Cu-N" are probably responsible for OER and HER. The bifunctional catalytic durability for both HER and OER was measured by chronopotentiometry experiments, which were performed in 1.0m KOH solution for more than 12 h (Figure 9). The catalytic current density was fixed at

Figure 9. Chronopotentiometry data for Cu-CMP850 catalyst under an alternating catalytic current density at 1.0 mA cm-<sup>2</sup> for OER and -1 mA cm-<sup>2</sup> for HER with 80% iR compensation.

1.0 mA cm-<sup>2</sup> for OER and -1.0 mA cm-<sup>2</sup> for HER. Stable current densities were observed during long-term performance testing, accompanied by gas bubbles on the surface of the electrode during the experiments. The stable current densities for water oxidation and hydrogen evolution required an applied potential of approximately 1.65 V and -0.37 V, respectively. These potentials are higher than the required potentials obtained by LSV in Figure 7 a and Figure 8 a. One probable reason is that the gas bubbles generated during the experiments cannot be quickly released from the glass carbon (GC) electrode surface. Another possible reason is that the catalyst surface is oxidized and reduced during the switch between water oxidation process and water reduction process.

To further check the stability of the Cu-CMP850 catalyst, SEM and XRD data were collected after 12 h of chronopotentiometry experiments. From the SEM results (Figure 10 a), there was

High-resolution XPS spectra of Cu 2p (b), O 1s (c), and N 1s (d) of Cu-CMP850 material before catalysis, after OER, and after HER.

no clear change in the morphologies and the hollow rod-like structure remained, demonstrating that the structure of Cu-CMP850 did not collapse during electrocatalysis. The plot in Figure S7 shows the diffraction peaks of Cu-CMP850 before and after electrocatalysis. The typical Cu<sup>0</sup> diffraction peak was similar, but the peak of the (111) plane became broad compared to the previous peak, indicating the crystallinity of Cu<sup>0</sup> was reduced during electrocatalysis. The XPS data showed the changes of the elemental valence states after the electrochemical experiments. From the high-resolution Cu 2p and O 1s XPS spectra (Figure 10 b and c), the binding energies of Cu 2p3/2 (934.1 eV), Cu 2p1/2 (953.8 eV), and O 1s (531.6 eV) indicated the existence of CuO after OER. In addition, the peak located at 532.7 eV can be attributed to chemisorbed water and this result is consistent with the XPS data before electrocatalysis. The XPS data for Cu 2p after OER indicate the transformation of Cu<sup>0</sup> to CuO on the surface of the catalysts, which is probably owing to the oxidation of Cu0 during the experiment for water oxidation. The XPS data for Cu 2p and O 1s after HER is consistent with the results before electrocatalysis, indicating that the catalyst retained its chemical composition. The results further illustrate that the present catalyst is switchable for both hydrogen production and water oxidation. From the high-resolution XPS N 1s spectrum (Figure 10 d), the types and positions of the peaks did not change significantly after OER or after HER, and only the proportion of different N types changed. The specific peak fitting results of XPS are summarized in Table S2.

The Faradaic efficiencies for hydrogen production and oxygen evolution of the Cu-CMP850 catalyst were measured

by gas chromatography and a fluorescence-based oxygen sensor (Figure 11). Bulk electrolysis was performed in 1.0 m KOH solution at pH 13.6 in a gas-tight electrochemical cell under an inert atmosphere. For the hydrogen evolution reaction, hydrogen gas was measured by gas chromatography with thermal conductivity detection (TCD). The theoretical yield of hydrogen was calculated by assuming that all of the current was caused by 2 e<sup>-</sup> reduction of water to produce hydrogen. Comparing the experimental data with the theoretical data, a Faradaic yield of approximately 90% for hydrogen production was achieved during the electrolysis for 3 h at -350 mV. For the oxygen evolution reaction, the sensor was placed in the headspace of the cell. After initiating electrolysis, oxygen bubbles were rapidly generated on the electrode surface accompanied by the rise of the oxygen percentage in the headspace. The theoretical yield of oxygen was calculated by assuming that all of the currents were caused by 4 e<sup>-</sup> oxidation of water to produce oxygen. Comparing the experimental data with the theoretical data, a Faradaic efficiency of more than 97% for oxygen evolution was achieved during electrolysis for 2.5 h at 1.75 V.

#### **Conclusions**

A novel copper porphyrin-based conjugated mesoporous polymer was synthesized and used to make nitrogen-enriched porous carbons with the incorporation of copper/copper oxide nanoparticles. The material with a high surface area and unique tubular nanostructure can serve as an excellent bifunctional catalyst for OER and HER in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte. After pyrolysis, Cu-CMP850 exhibited the lowest overpotential (350 mV) to reach a catalytic current density of 1.0 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> with great durability in alkaline media. A Faradaic efficiency of approximately 97% for water oxidation was achieved using Cu-CMP850 as the electrocatalyst under an applied potential of 1.75 V. The Tafel plot was determined at pH 13.6 and its slope was approximately 62 mV/decade<sup>-1</sup>. Furthermore, Cu-CMP850 also demonstrated good performance for HER with a quite low overpotential (0.19 V) to reach 1.0 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> as well as a high current density (-50 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> at an overpotential of 0.47 V). The Tafel slope was approximately 135 mV decade<sup>-1</sup>. A Faradaic efficiency of approximately 90% for water reduction was achieved under an applied potential of -0.34 V. Therefore,

Cu-CMP850 is an attractive alternative to noble metal-based catalysts for water splitting.

**Synthesis of Cu-CMP**. [18,19] 1,5-Cyclooctadiene (62 mg, 0.57 mmol) was added to a DMF solution (8 mL) of bis(1,5-cyclooctadiene)nickel(0) (159 mg, 0.57 mmol) and 2,2'-bipyridyl (90 mg, 0.57 mmol) and the mixture was heated at 80 °C for 1 h.

**Template-free Pyrolysis of Cu-CMP.** The pyrolysis reactions of the Cu-CMP were performed on quartz tubes in an electric furnace under a nitrogen atmosphere. The Cu-CMP samples were heated at different temperatures (600, 700, 800, 850, and 900°C; heating rate of 3°Cmin<sup>-1</sup>) for 2 h under nitrogen. The materials obtained from the pyrolysis reactions at 600, 700, 800, 850, and 900°C were denoted as Cu-CMP600, Cu-CMP700, Cu-CMP800, Cu-CMP850, and Cu-CMP900.

**Electrochemical methods.** Electrochemical experiments were performed using a CHI760E potentiostat (Shanghai Chenhua Instrument Co., Ltd.) at RT in a three-electrode cell. The Cu-CMP material after thermal treatment was loaded onto a clean glass carbon (GC) electrode (diameter=3 mm,  $0.071\,\text{cm}^2$ ) using a drop-casting method. Two milligrams of the catalyst powder was dispersed in 0.9 mL ethanol and 0.1 mL 5 wt% Nafion solution. The resulting solution was homogenized by ultrasonic dispersion for 20 min to make the catalyst ink. Then,  $10\,\mu\text{L}$  of the ink was drop-cast onto the GC electrode and dried in air at RT (loading amount:  $0.28\,\text{mg\,cm}^{-2}$ ). The reference electrode was an Ag/AgCl electrode

7

(3 M KCl solution, 0.21 V vs. NHE). Pt wire was used as the counter electrode and a GC electrode coated with the catalyst as the working electrode. All LSVs were performed at a rate of 5 mV s $^{-1}$  with 80% iR compensations and without stirring. For chronopotentiometry, the GC electrode coated with catalysts was used as the working electrode in 1.0 m KOH solution. The measurements were performed with an alternating current density of 1.0 mA cm $^{-2}$  and  $-1.0~{\rm mA\,cm}^{-2}$  without stirring and 80% iR compensation.

Reference electrode calibration. We used a Ag/AgCl electrode as the reference electrode in all electrochemical measurements. It was calibrated with respect to RHE. The calibration was performed in a high-purity hydrogen saturated electrolyte with a Pt wire as the working electrode. cyclic voltammograms (CVs) were run at a scan rate of 1 mV s<sup>-1</sup> in 1.0 m KOH solution, and the average of the two potentials at which the current crossed zero was taken to be the thermodynamic potential for the hydrogen electrode reactions.

**Electrochemical Surface Area (ECSA)**. We approximated the ECSA by using the electrochemical double layer capacitance  $(C_{\rm dl})$ .<sup>[34]</sup> The  $C_{\rm dl}$  of the as-prepared materials were investigated on the basis of double layer charging curves using CVs recorded at different scan rates from 10–120 mV s<sup>-1</sup> (10, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, and 120 mV s<sup>-1</sup>) in a small non-faradaic potential range from 1.01 to 1.11 V versus RHE. In this potential region, the current originated only from electrical double layer charging and discharging without considering the charge transfer electrode reactions. The double layer capacitance  $(C_{\rm dl})$  is estimated by plotting the  $\Delta J$   $(J_a - J_c)$  at 1.06 V against the scan rate, where  $J_a$  and  $J_c$  are the anodic and cathodic current density, respectively, and the slope is twice of the  $C_{\rm dl}$ . Then, the ECSA (cm²) could be calculated according to Equation (1).

$$ECSA(cm^2) = C_{dl}/C_s \tag{1}$$

 $C_{\rm s}$  is the specific capacitance and reported to be between 0.022 to 0.130 mF cm² in alkaline solution. In this work, we use the  $C_{\rm s}$  value of 0.04 mF cm² based on the previous literature.<sup>[35]</sup>

**Faradaic efficiency.** The hydrogen production experiments were performed in a gas-tight electrochemical cell in 1.0 m KOH solution at pH 13.6 using a GC electrode as the working electrode. Before the test, air was excluded by bubbling with high purity  $N_2$  for 20 min with stirring. Hydrogen gas was measured by gas chromatography (SP-6890, nitrogen as a carrier gas) with a thermal conductivity detection (TCD) detector. Methane was used as an internal standard. The oxygen evolution experiments were tested under controlled potential electrolysis (CPE). The generated oxygen in the headspace was quantified by a fluorescence-based oxygen sensor (Ocean Optics). The  $O_2$  sensor on the FOXY probe, recorded at 2 s intervals, provided the data to calculate the partial pressure of  $O_2$  in the headspace. After recording the partial pressure of  $O_2$  for 30 min to check the tightness of the cell, bulk electrolysis was initiated under a potential of 1.75 V without iR drop compensation.

Physical characterization. High-resolution mass spectra were obtained by a Bruker Daltonics Inc. LTQ Orbitrap XL hybrid Fourier transform high-resolution mass spectrometer. UV/Vis spectra were measured on a UNIC-3802 spectrophotometer, with samples in standard quartz cuvettes. SEM images were obtained on a SIRION200 Schottky field emission scanning electron microscope (SFE-SEM) with an acceleration voltage of 5 or 10 kV. Before loading into the instrument, the catalyst samples were coated with Au to improve their conductivity. The morphologies of the samples

were further analyzed by TEM measurement using a JEM-2011 electron microscope at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. The catalyst samples were also investigated by HRTEM. XPS spectra were acquired with an ESCALAB 250 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy instrument. The binding energies were obtained with reference to the C1s peak (285.0 eV). Nitrogen sorption isotherms were measured at 77 K with Quantachrome ASIQM0000-5 analyzer. Before measurement, the samples were degassed under vacuum at 180 °C for more than 10 h. The BET method was applied to calculate the surface areas and the density functional theory method was used for pore sizes and pore size distributions. The crystalline patterns of the catalyst materials were measured by X-ray diffraction (XRD, D/max-TTR III) using graphite monochromatized CuK $_{\alpha}$  radiation of 1.54178 Å, operating at 40 kV and 200 mA. The scanning rate was 5° min $^{-1}$  between 2 $\theta$  = 10° to 70°.

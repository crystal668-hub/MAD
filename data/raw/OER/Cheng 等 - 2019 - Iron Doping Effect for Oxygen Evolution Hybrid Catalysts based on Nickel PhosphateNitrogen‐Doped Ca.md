#### **Abstract:**

Developing highly efficient and earth-abundant oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts is of great significance for sustainable energy conversion technologies. Herein, a facile thermal transformation strategy was developed to synthesize nickel iron phosphate nanoparticles incorporated in N-doped carbon (NiFeP/N-C) nanoflakes as highly efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts based on metal organophosphonate (MOP) precursor. The amino trismethylene phosphonic acid (ATMP) ligand used here has excellent affinity toward various metals and thus can act as P, C and N source on a molecular scale, which simplify the synthesis of conductive materials supported multimetal phosphates. Benefiting from the derived N-doped carbon and the synergistic effect of bimetal ions, sample denoted as NiFeP/N-C-700 exhibits outstanding electrocatalytic activity. It exhibits a lower overpotential of 280 mV, a small Tafel slope of 48 mV·dec<sup>-1</sup> at a current density of 10 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> and superior stability in 1 M KOH solution.

technologies for renewable and clean energy has been attracting increasingly attention.[1,2,3] Water splitting to generate hydrogen is widely considered as a promising approach for providing clean and sustainable energy.[4,5,6] In term of the two half-reactions of water splitting, the anode oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is regarded as the bottleneck due to the sluggish reaction kinetics and multistep proton-coupled electron transfer process, which limits the whole water splitting reaction.[7,8] Generally, nobel metal based oxide materials (RuO2 and IrO2) are recognized as state-of-the-art electrocatalysts for OER. Unfortunately, the high cost, poor durability, and scarcity of these noble metals seriously limit their widespread applications.[9,10,11] Earth-abundant and highly active OER electrocatalysts are increasingly needed to enhance the efficiency of water splitting. Recently, transition-metals based electrocatalysts including transition metal phosphates,[12,13] phosphides,[14-17] oxides,[18,19] hydroxides[20,21] and sulfides[22] have been reported as alternatives to the conventional noble metal oxide OER catalysts. For metal phosphates electrocatalysts, the phosphate group can facilitates the proton coupling electron transfer kinetics[23,24] and stabilize the active center.[25] Many metal phosphates electrocatalysts such as Ni2P4O12, [26] Co3(PO4)2, [12] NiCo2(PO4)2, [13] Mn3(PO4)2, [25] exhibit excellent electrocatalytic performance. Nonetheless, most metal phosphates usually use inorganic metal phosphates (such as NaH2PO4) as the phosphate group source during the synthesis process. Thus the conductivity of these metal phosphates is not satisfied enough and will limits their electrocatalytic properties. It will increase the complexity of the preparation process that addition of conductive supports during synthesis. On the other hand, bimetallic based materials can increase the catalytic performance of catalysts, which attributed to the synergistic effect of different active metal ions.[27,28,29] Therefore, further studies of the synthesis of metal phosphates under highly desirable.

Metal organophosphonate (MOP) materials are an important branch of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) containing metals coordinately bonded to organophosphonic acid ligands.[30] Due to their diverse structures, higher thermal and chemical stability, MOPs are promising in the applications of catalysis,[31] energy conversion,[32] adsorption,[33] and magnetism.[34] Organophosphonic acid ligands have a strong affinity to metal ions and can act as P and C source on the molecular scale at the same time, which contributed to simplify the addition of conductive support to multimetal phosphonates. Besides, abundant of organophosphonic acid ligands are available and can easily modified with heteroelements (such as S, N). Furthermore, it's easy to prepare various monometal or multimetal organophosphonates by adjusting the metal ions and organophosphonic acid ligands, as a wide range of metals can react with variety organophosphonic acid ligands. All these indicate that the MOPs are promising precursors to prepare metal phosphates with specific structures and properties.

In this work, we report the synthesis of bimetallic nickel iron phosphate nanoparticles incorporated in N-doped carbon (NiFeP/N-C) nanoflakes using a two-dimensional (2D) MOP as the precursor by a facile, two-step, thermal transformation method (scheme 1). During the synthesis process, FeCl3·6H2O and

NiCl2·6H2O mixed solution was reacted with amino trismethylene phosphonic acid (ATMP) in water by the hydrothermal method first, after that the as-prepared precipitates were annealed in air to obtain the final products. The ATMP ligand used here not only acted as the P source, but also thermally decomposed into N-doped carbon at the same time during the calcination process. Benefited from the derived N-doped carbon and the synergistic effect of bimetal ions, the sample denoted as NiFeP/N-C-700 exhibits the outstanding OER performance with an overpotential of 280 mV at a current density of 10 mA/cm2 and showing long-term stability in 1 M KOH solution. Furthermore, the facile approach can be extended to design various metal phosphates incorporated in carbon materials with specific structures and properties, as a wide range of metals react with organophosphonic acids to form MOP materials.

# **2 Results and Discussion**

**Fig. 1** XRD patterns of (a) NiPP and NiFePP composites with various Ni/Fe rations; XRD patterns of (b) NiP/N-C and NiFeP/N-C composites with various Ni/Fe rations; XRD patterns of (c) NiFeP/N-C-700, NiFeP/N-C-800 and NiFeP/N-C-900; FT-IR spectra of (d) NiPP and NiFePP composites with various Ni/Fe rations.

Fig. 1a presented the XRD pattern of as-prepared metal organophosphonate precursors. It can be seen that all the samples have the same structure with well crystallinity. Obviously, the peaks intensity gradually decreases with the incorporation of Fe atoms. The strong characteristic peaks shown in low angle indicate that these samples have a layered structure. As shown in Fig. 1b, after calcined at 700°C under air the XRD pattern was changed, indicating the conversion from metal organophosphonate precursors to metal phosphates. The diffraction peaks appearing in 29.83°, 30.36°, 35.70°, and 43.20° can be indexed to (212), (-402), (420) and (232) planes, which accords with Ni2P2O7 (JCPDS No. 74-1604). The position of the diffraction peaks of the derived NiP/N-C and NiFeP/N-C are identical, but the peaks intensity degree of NiFeP/N-C was lower than NiP/N-C as a result of the addition of iron element. Furthermore, it should be noted that the crystallinity of NiFeP/N-C-T was getting better with the rise of pyrolysis temperature (Fig. 1c).

Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy was measured to evaluate the framework structure of the materials. As shown in Fig. 1d, the broad band at around 3400 cm-1 and the small band at 1640 cm-1 belong to stretching vibrations of hydroxyl from the adsorbed water molecules. The two bands at 2868 and 2928 cm-1 can be assigned to C-H stretching vibrations of organics in the organophosphonate framework. The bands at around 1403 and 1312 cm-1 corresponds to P-C and C-N stretching vibrations from the organophosphorous groups, respectively. The strong band at 950-1100 cm-1 is due to the phosphonate P-O-M (M=metal) stretching vibrations.[35] The peak at around 450-600 cm-1 can be assigned to the M-O (M=metal) stretching vibration of the materials. Thus, the FT-IR spectra confirm the presence of ATMP in the framework by the formation of stable P-O-M bonds. After calcination, the C-H stretching vibrations disappear, which corresponds to the decomposition of organic groups (Fig. S1).

Fig. 2 shows scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of metal organophosphonate precursors. It can be clearly seen that the as-prepared samples showed typical flake morphology. As shown in Fig.2a and 2b, the average width of NiPP nanoflakes is about 800 nm with a layered structure, which consists with the XRD results. For NiFePP nanoflakes (Fig. 2c-f), the average width decreased to about 100 nm and the surface become rough and defective, which attributed to the incorporation of Fe. For the derived metal phosphate samples, the SEM and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were shown in Fig. 3. Obviously, the products maintain their original flake morphology after calcination, which may provide more active sites for OER catalysis. It should be noted that the length of NiFeP/N-C-700 nanoflakes decreased due to the decomposition of organic groups (Fig. 3a, b, e, f). As shown in Fig. S2, the elemental mappings of the NiFeP/N-C-700 nanoflakes show it contains Ni, Fe, P, O, C and N elements, indicating that calcination process from NiFePP can obtain metal phosphate nanoparticles incorporated in N-doped carbon materials. The trace amounts of carbon and nitrogen elements are coming from the ATMP ligand. The derived N-doped carbon support can not only prevent the aggregation of nanoparticles but also improve the electron transfer, thus further enhance the OER activity. As shown in Fig. 3c and 3d, with the calcinations temperature increasing, the size of the nanoflakes further decrease and these nanoflakes tend to fuse together to form a bulk structure, which correspond to enhanced crystallinity (Fig. 1c). Moreover, the SEM images of NiP/N-C and NiFeP/N-C materials (MNi:MFe=29:1, 28:2, and 26:4) are shown in Fig. S3.

The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to characterize the chemical composition and elemental valence states of NiFeP/N-C-700. As shown in Fig. 4a, the survey spectrum confirms the presence of Ni, Fe, P, O, C and N elements in the sample. The high resolution XPS spectra for Ni 2p is shown in Fig. 4b, the peaks at 856.9 and 862.5 eV are assigned to Ni 2p3/2 binding energy, which can be ascribed to Ni2+ in nickel phosphates and satellite peak, respectively. The peaks in the region of 870 to 880 eV are attributed to Ni 2p1/2, which follow similar rules as the Ni 2p3/2 peaks.[36] The Fe 2p spectra exhibits two broad peaks, which correspond to Fe 2p3/2 and Fe 2p1/2 states. Specifically, the peaks at 712.5 and 725.8 eV are attributed to high valence state Fe3+ (Fig. 4c).[37] In Fig. 4d, the peak at 133.8 eV is assigned to P in metal phosphates, demonstrating that the P atoms are +5 oxidation state. As shown in Fig. 4e and 4f, the peak at 284.8 and 402.2 eV are attributed to the C 1s and N 1s, respectively. Moreover, the peak at 531.5 eV is assigned to the O 1s in phosphate species (Fig. S4).

The OER electrocatalytic activities of all the metal phosphates were measured by the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) at a scan rate of 10 mV·s-1 in 1 M KOH solution. The overpotential at a current density of 10 mA·cm-2 and the corresponding Tafel slope are important parameters to evaluate the OER electrochemical performance. Fig. 5a shows the LSV polarization curves of as-prepared samples. The NiFeP/N-C (MNi:MFe=27:3) catalyst can deliver a current density of 10 mA·cm-2 at 1.51 V, lower than that of other samples. As shown in Fig. S5, the overpotential of NiP/N-C (390 mV) was higher than that of NiFeP/N-C catalysts at a current density of 10 mA·cm-2. With increasing the content of Fe (decreasing Ni/Fe ratio from 29-1 to 27-3), the

overpotential at 10 mA·cm-2 was decreased from 310 to 280 mV. However, when further increase the Fe content (MNi:MFe=26:4), the overpotential increased to 300 mV. Tafel plots were established based on LSV curves (Fig. 5b). Obviously, NiFeP/N-C (MNi:MFe=27:3) has the lowest Tafel slope (48 mV·dec-1) among all the catalysts. Based on the above data, we can conclude that NiFeP/N-C (MNi:MFe=27:3) exhibits the highest OER eletrocatalytic activity. Moreover, these results suggest that doped proper Fe content into nickel phosphates can improve the OER eletrocatalytic activity attributed to the synergistic effect.

Fig. 5c shows the LSV polarization curves of as-prepared NiFeP/N-C-T samples.

The NiFeP/N-C-700 catalyst can deliver a current density of 10 mA·cm-2 at 1.51 V, which was lower than those of NiFeP/N-C-800 (1.53V) and NiFeP/N-C-900 (1.56 V). The overpotential at 10 mA·cm-2 of the NiFeP/N-C-T (T = 700, 800, and 900 °C) catalysts were 280, 300 and 330 mV, respectively (Fig. S6). Besides, the corresponding Tafel slopes were 48, 65, and 75 mV·dec-1, respectively (Fig. 5d). The smaller values for overpotential and Tafel slope, indicating that better kinetics and higher OER catalytic activity of NiFeP/N-C-700 catalyst. With the increase of calcination temperature, material internal defects gradually decrease. Compared with the better crystalline materials, more internal defects in NiFeP/N-C-700 will provide more active sites for OER.[38] Moreover, the OER activity of NiFeP/N-C-700 nanoflakes is also comparable to those of most previously reported materials (Table S1). The excellent OER performance of the NiFeP/N-C-700 nanoflakes can be manily attributed to the following aspects. First, the nanoflake morphology is expected to offer abundant active sites and effective mass transport for OER.[39] Second, the N-doped carbon derived from the precursor anchored the active metal phosphates preventing aggregation and facilitating electron transfer as a conductive support. Third, the synergistic effect between Ni, Fe, P, C and N contributed to the outstanding OER activities.

displays the potentiostatic stability test of NiFeP/N-C-700 at 1.51 V versus RHE.

The stability test of the NiFeP/N-C-700 catalyst for OER is conducted with cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements at a scan rate 50 mV/s and the long-term durability was measured by the *I-t* test at a constant potential of 1.51V vs. RHE. Fig. 6 shows that the current density decreased 5.3% over 10 hours and after 1000 CV cycles the LSV curves remained almost unchanged with the current density only slightly degraded. The excellent electrochemical stability of NiFeP/N-C-700 catalyst is also verified by chronopotentiometry. It can be seen that the potential remains largely unchanged after 12 h, suggesting the excellent stability of NiFeP/N-C-700 (Fig. S7). Consequently, these data indicate that NiFeP/N-C-700 nanoflakes have a superior catalytic activity toward OER. .

# **3 Conclusions**

In summary, NiFeP/N-C nanoflakes were successfully developed as efficient OER electrocatalysts templated by MOP, the organic ligand of ATMP served as the molecular scale P, C and N sources. Benefiting from the conductive N-doped carbon derived from the precursor and the synergistic effect by the bimetal ions, the NiFeP/N-C-700 (MNi:MFe=27:3) composite reveals excellent OER performance. It shows a low overpotential of 280 mV at the current density of 10 mA/cm2 and a small Tafel slope of 48 mV·dec-1 and exhibits long-term stability in 1 M KOH solution. Furthermore, by adjusting metal ions and organophosphorous acid ligands, various mono-metal or multi-metal phonates incorporated in carbon materials can be obtained use the method reported here, which may have potential applications in energy conversion and storage.

The metal organophosphonate precursors were prepared according to the method reported by Yusuke Yamauchi et al..[40] In a typical synthesis of nickel organophosphonate material, 1 mmol of ATMP solution was added into10 mL of water and adjusted the PH value to 4 using aqueous ammonia solution. Afterwards, the solution of 3 mmol NiCl2·6H2O solving in10 mL water and dropped into the above acid solution. Then, adjusted the PH of the mixture solution to 5 by adding aqueous ammonia solution and kept stirring for another 2 hours. Finally, the mixture solution was transferred to Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and aged at 180 °C for 12 hours. The green precipitate was collected by centrifugation and washed with distilled water repeatedly and dried at 60 °C overnight. As-prepared products were named as NiPP. The synthetic route of NiFePP was almost the same as NiPP, except that the addition of FeCl3·6H2O. During the synthesis of NiFePP, FeCl3·6H2O was added into the water with NiCl2·6H2O at the same time in various molar ratio with a total mole of 3 mmol (MNi:MFe=29:1, 28:2, 27:3 and 26:4).

The obtained samples were denoted as NiP/N-C and NiFeP/N-C, respectively. For comparison, NiFePP precursor (MNi:MFe=27:3) was further calcined at temperture of 800°C and 900°C for 3 hours under air, respectively. The prepared samples denoted as NiFeP/N-C-T (T signs for calcination temperature).

Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra of the samples were measured with a Thermo Scientific Nicolet iS10 FTIR spectrometer. The morphologies of the products were characterized from a Hitachi SU70 field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) instrument at 10 KV. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed with a JEOL JEM-2100 instrument operated at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV.

To prepare the working electrode, 5 mg of sample was dispersed into a mixture of 950 μL ethanol and 50 μL 5wt% Nafion solution under sonication for 1 hour. Then the mixture (20 μL) was dropped onto the glassy carbon electrode (5 mm in diameter) and dried at room temperature for 12 hours before further measurements (loading ~0.510 mg·cm-2). The polarization curves were obtained from LSV test at a scan rate of 10 mV/s. All potentials were referred to reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) with the following equation: ERHE =EAg/AgCl + 0.197 + 0.059*pH*.

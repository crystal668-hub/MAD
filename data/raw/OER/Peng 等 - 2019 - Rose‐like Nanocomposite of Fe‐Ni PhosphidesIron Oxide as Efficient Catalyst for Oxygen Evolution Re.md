**Abstract** In order to accelerate the reaction rate of water splitting, it is of immense importance to develop low-cost, stable and efficient catalysts. In this study, the facile synthesis of novel rose-like nanocomposite catalysts (Ni2P/Fe2P/Fe3O4) is reported. The synthesis process includes a solvothermal step and a phosphatization step to combine iron oxides and iron-nickel phosphides. Ni2P/Fe2P/Fe3O<sup>4</sup> performs well in catalyzing oxygen evolution reaction, with a very low overpotential of 365 mV to reach 10 mA·cm-2 current density. The Tafel slope is as low as 59 mV·dec-1 . Ni2P/Fe2P/Fe3O4has a large double-layer capacitance that contributes to more electrochemical active area. Moreover, this catalyst is very stable for long-term use. Therefore, the Ni2P/Fe2P/Fe3O4catalyst has high potential for oxygen evolution reaction.

#### **Introduction**

Traditional non-renewable energy has been far from meeting the huge needs.[\[1-2\]](#page-15-0) Water splitting, regarded as a promising approach to solve energy crisis, has aroused wide interest.[\[3-5\]](#page-15-1) Water splitting is generally composed of two reactions: one is hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) occurring at the cathode and the other is oxygen evolution reaction (OER) occurring at the anode.[\[4\]](#page-15-2) The rate of OER is usually determined by the four-electron process which significantly hinders the efficient water splitting.[\[5-6\]](#page-15-3) An overpotential is needed for activating the energy barrier.[\[7\]](#page-15-4) Under ideal conditions, 3.55 kWh electricity is needed to decompose a liter of water, while 4.26 kWh electricity would be required with energy loss considered.[\[8\]](#page-15-5) For the sake of diminish overpotential as well as accelerate the reaction, there is a strong demand for efficient catalysts. [\[9\]](#page-15-6)

In the past decades, noble metals and their oxides such as Ru and RuO<sup>2</sup> are regarded as the state-of-the-art catalysts for OER.[\[6,](#page-15-7) [9\]](#page-15-6) Nevertheless, the high cost and scarcity limit their widespread use.[\[10-11\]](#page-15-8) Thus, it is essential to develop abundant and low-cost catalysts with performance comparable to those of noble metals and noble metal oxides. [\[11-12\]](#page-15-9) Recently, 3d transition metal oxides,[\[2,](#page-15-10) [13\]](#page-15-11) phosphides,[\[9,](#page-15-6) [14\]](#page-15-12) sulfides,[\[15-16\]](#page-15-13) and so on[\[17-18\]](#page-15-14) have been shown to have excellent catalytic performances for water splitting. They have low cost, high activity and long-term durability under oxidation conditions, which makes the splitting of water more practical and feasible.[\[17,](#page-15-14) [19\]](#page-15-15) In the past, there have been many reports on 3d transition metal oxides as OER catalysts such as NiCo2O4, [\[20\]](#page-15-16) MnO2, [\[21\]](#page-15-17) Fe3O4, [\[13\]](#page-15-11) and so on. Among these compounds, Fe3O<sup>4</sup> has received widespread attention because of its high stability and catalytic activity.[\[13\]](#page-15-11) Transition metal phosphides attract much interest due to the excellent catalyze activity in OER.[\[22-23\]](#page-15-18) For example, Co2P,[\[24\]](#page-15-19) MoP,[\[25\]](#page-15-20) and Co4Ni1P [\[26\]](#page-15-21) have good catalytic activity and are promising for application in water splitting.

Herein, we report the composite material of iron-nickel phosphides with iron oxides as an efficient and stable catalyst towards OER. The rose-like nanocomposite material of Ni2P/Fe2P/Fe3O<sup>4</sup> was synthesized by solvothermal process and phosphatization (**Scheme 1**). This catalyst possesses the advantages of both metal oxides and metal phosphides, exhibiting admirable catalytic activity for OER. A current density of 10 mA·cm-2 was obtained with a low catalytic overpotential of 365 mV in 1M KOH. Moreover, the catalyst has a small Tafel slope of 59 mV·dec-1 and remarkable durability over a long working time. Therefore, Ni2P/Fe2P/Fe3O<sup>4</sup> has great potential as catalyst for OER.

#### **Results and discussion**

The XRD patterns of precursor FeNi-bimetallic hydroxides and product Ni2P/Fe2P/Fe3O4are shown in **Fig. 1A and Fig. 1B** respectively. As shown in **Fig. 1A**, FeNi-bimetallic hydroxides consist of FeOOH (JCPDS card No. 00-034-1266) and Ni(OH)2(JCPDS card No. 00-057-0907). The peaks at 11.8°, 16.8°, 26.7°, 35.2° 36.1°, 39.2°, 43.0°, 43.8°, 46.4°, 55.1°, and 64.4° are from FeOOH. The peaks at 19.2°, 33.1°, 38.5°, 52.1°, 59.1°, 60.2°, 72.7°, and 73.1° belong to Ni(OH)2. After phosphatization, FeNi-bimetallic hydroxides turned into Ni2P/Fe2P/Fe3O<sup>4</sup> (shown in **Fig. 1B**), which consist of Fe2P (JCPDS card No. 85-1725), Ni2P (JCPDS card No. 74-1385) and Fe3O<sup>4</sup> (JCPDS card No. 75-0033). The peaks at 40.7°, 44.6°, 47.4°, 54.2°, 55.0°, and 66.4° are from both Ni2P and Fe2P. The peaks at 72.7°, and 74.8° come from Ni2P, while the peaks at 52.9°, 73.7° and 79.1° are from Fe2P. The peaks at 18.3°, 30.1°, 35.5°, 43.1°, 57.0°, and 62.6° are from Fe3O4. The transformation from FeNi-bimetallic hydroxidesto Ni2P/Fe2P/Fe3O<sup>4</sup> can be expressed as follows:

$$Fe^{3+} + 3OH^{-} \rightarrow FeOOH + H_{2}O \tag{1}$$

$$Ni^{2+} + 2OH^{-} \rightarrow Ni(OH)_{2}$$

$$5\text{NaH}_2\text{PO}_2 \rightarrow \text{Na}_4\text{P}_2\text{O}_7 + \text{NaPO}_3 + 2\text{PH}_3 \uparrow + 2\text{H}_2 \uparrow$$
 (3)

$$3PH_3 + 11FeOOH \rightarrow Fe_2P + 2P + 10H_2O + 3Fe_3O_4$$
 (4)

$$4PH_3 + 6Ni(OH)_2 \rightarrow 3Ni_2P + P + 12H_2O$$

As shown in **Fig. 2A**, nanosheets are interlaced and assembled to form rose-like structures of FeNi-bimetallic hydroxides. As shown in the enlarged SEM image (**Fig. 2B**), the surface of each petal of the material is smooth and consists of cracked plates. As shown in the SEM images of Ni<sub>2</sub>P/Fe<sub>2</sub>P/Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (**Fig. 2C** and **Fig. 2D**), the Ni<sub>2</sub>P/Fe<sub>2</sub>P/Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> preserves the rose-like morphology after phosphatization. The annealing step makes the petals rough, causing more pores on the surface which contributes to more defects in the Ni<sub>2</sub>P/Fe<sub>2</sub>P/Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> matrix. Thus, the rose-like structure facilitates the contact with KOH solution.

Barrett-Joyner-Halenda methods (BJH) and Brunner-Emmet-Teller measurements (BET) were utilized to characterize the specific surface area and pore size of Ni2P/Fe2P/Fe3O4. As shown in **Fig. 3A**, there is a distinct isotherm hysteresis loop, which belongs to type IV adsorption isotherm, indicating that the material has mesoporous structure. The pore size distribution curve shows that the pore size of the catalyst is primarily ~21.5 nm (**Fig. 3B)**. Most of the pores are mesopores, along with small amount of micropores and large pores. A large number of mesopores not only provides more active catalytic sites, but also facilitates the diffusion and transfer of electrolytes and gases generated in the catalytic process. The specific surface area of Ni2P/Fe2P/Fe3O<sup>4</sup> is 21.3 m<sup>2</sup> /g.

TEM was used to further characterize the morphology. As shown in **Fig. 4A,** the composite material has a flower structure with irregular edges. As shown in **Fig. 4B**, there are many defects in the petals. The results are in agreement with the SEM observation. HRTEM pattern taken from one petal of the nano-rose reveals the lattice fringes (**Fig. 4C**), and the results is consistent with that from XRD. Through fast Fourier transformation, the interplanar distance of 0.34 nm matches well with the (0 0 1) crystallographic planes of hexagonal crystal Ni2P phase. The interplanar distance of of 0.29 nm is consistent with the (1 1 0) planes of Fe2P phase. The interplanar distance of 0.48 nm corresponds to (1 1 1) planes of Fe3O<sup>4</sup> phase. EDS is used to analyze the elemental composition. Elemental mapping spectrum shown in **Fig. 4D** to **Fig. 4G** reveals that the Ni, Fe, P, and O elements are homogeneously distributed.

The XPS spectrum shows the Fe 2p1/2 and Fe 2p3/2 peaks (**Fig. 5B**). The peak of Fe 2p1/2 at 725.2 eV indicates the Fe oxidation state.[\[27\]](#page-16-0) The Fe 2p3/2 contains two peaks at 708.6 eV and 712.0 eV. The former corresponds to Fe-P binding energy, and the latter belongs to iron phosphate on account of the inevitable oxidation of top layer of phosphides.[\[28-29\]](#page-16-1) The Ni 2p spectrum (**Fig. 5C**) displays two main peaks located on 856.9 eV as well as 874.6 eV, accompanied by the satellite peaks of them, echoing Ni2+. There is a weak peak at 852.4 eV, which can be interpreted as the the binding energy of partially positive charges Niδ + distributed in Ni2P [\[30-31\]](#page-16-2) As shown in **Fig. 5D**, the spectra of O1s located at 531.6 eV is due to the presence of metal oxygen bond.[\[32\]](#page-16-3) Because water is physically or chemically adsorbed in the free state, there are two weak peaks at 532.5 and 533.5 eV.[\[33\]](#page-16-4) In **Fig. 5E**, there are three peaks of P 2p. The peaks at 129.5 eV and 130.1 eV belong to reduced phosphorus in the compound. Moreover, the oxidized P species (P5+) peak can be observed at 133.9 eV. The peak at 129.5 eV shows a little smaller binding energy value than 130.0 eV which

belong to P<sup>0</sup> , indicating that there is strong binding between metals and partially negatively charged Pδ − . [\[30-31\]](#page-16-2)

The catalytic activity for OER was measured in 1 M KOH solution via a threeelectrode system. The electrolyte solution was saturated with nitrogen for 30 minutes before the electrochemical measurement. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) reveals the overpotential of OER. The overpotential value (η10) of 10 mA·cm-2 current density is a vital reference. All the overpotential values have been corrected by iR. As shown in **Fig. 6A**, the overpotential of Ni2P/Fe2P/Fe3O<sup>4</sup> is 365 mV at 10 mA·cm-2 , which is slightly lower than RuO2with 375 mV, while Ni2P, Fe2P, and Fe3O<sup>4</sup> all need higher overpotential than RuO2. The onset overpotential is the potential applied when the electrode current is obvious. The onset overpotential is computed at a 1 mA·cm-2 current density. The onset overpotential of Ni2P/Fe2P/Fe3O<sup>4</sup> is 1.54 V, lower than that of the commercial one at 1.55 V Moreover, all the onset overpotentials of Ni2P, Fe2P, and Fe3O<sup>4</sup> are much higher than that of RuO<sup>2</sup> and Ni2P/Fe2P/Fe3O4. It is interesting that combining Ni2P, Fe2P, and Fe3O<sup>4</sup> can remarkably improve the performance of the catalytic capability. The high catalytic performance can be attributed to the rose-like structure of the composite material and the uniform distribution of active substances, which make full use of the active sites and improve the catalytic activity.

(B) Tafel slopes of Ni<sub>2</sub>P/Fe<sub>2</sub>P/Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, RuO<sub>2</sub>, Ni<sub>2</sub>P, Fe<sub>2</sub>P, and Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>.

Another important parameter to assess the kinetic process of electrode reaction is Tafel slope. However, log |i| deviates from the linear relationship under the condition that a large number of oxygen bubbles are generated at high overpotential. Therefore, the linear part with the low overpotential was fitted with the Tafel equation to determine the Tafel slope. Coefficient b indicates Tafel slope of the catalyst in the Tafel equation  $(\eta = b \log |j| + a)$ , with a and b determined by the rate controlling step. By converting the polarization curve data, taking log | j| as abscissa and overpotential η as ordinate, and using Tafel formula to fit the linear part, the corresponding Tafel slope was obtained. As shown in Fig. 6B, Ni<sub>2</sub>P/Fe<sub>2</sub>P/Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> has smaller Tafel slope than RuO<sub>2</sub>. The Tafel slope value of Ni<sub>2</sub>P/Fe<sub>2</sub>P/Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> is merely 59 mV·dec<sup>-1</sup>, while RuO<sub>2</sub> has a Tafel slope of 70 mV·dec<sup>-1</sup>. For comparison, Ni<sub>2</sub>P, Fe<sub>2</sub>P, and Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> all have much larger Tafel slope than Ni<sub>2</sub>P/Fe<sub>2</sub>P/Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>. Therefore, the Ni<sub>2</sub>P/Fe<sub>2</sub>P/Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> catalyst exhibits the highest activity among these mentioned. The result reveals that iron oxides coupled with iron-nickel phosphides enhanced the catalytic efficiency. Furthermore, compared with other Fe/Ni based catalysts for OER in recent study (**Table. 1**), Ni<sub>2</sub>P/Fe<sub>2</sub>P/Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> has the best performance.

To evaluate the active surface area of Ni2P/Fe2P/Fe3O4, CV curves (**Fig. 7A**) were used to obtain electrochemical double-layer capacitance (Cdl) at the solid-liquid interface. The variation of current density under fixed overpotential was plotted by using the median of potential range and scanning rate. During cyclic voltammetry, the current on the electrode consists of charge-discharge current (non-Faraday current) and electrochemical reaction current (Faraday current). With the increase of scanning rate, CV is measured in a non-Faradaic window (0.9-1.15V vs. RHE). The scanning range was from 5 to 100 mV·S-1 . From **Fig. 7B**, the Cdl of Ni2P/Fe2P/Fe3O<sup>4</sup> is 2.5 times of Fe2P, 3 times of Ni2P, and 20 times of Fe3O4, respectively. Therefore, combining iron oxides and iron-nickel phosphides provides the material with higher activity surface area. The result from the CV curve is consistent with the result of BET, both of which demonstrated improved catalytic activity.

To further explore the electrochemical kinetics, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was measured. And experimental data is expressed by the form of Nyquist plot, which can reflect contact resistance and the charge transfer resistance. In the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, the value of contact resistance is the initial intersection point between the semicircle and the X-axis, including the resistance of solutions, wires and contact points. Charge transfer resistance, which is determined by the intrinsic property of the material, is related to charge transfer rate. The charge transfer resistance can be represented by the semicircle diameter in the high frequency region. Lower charge transfer resistance values indicate faster reaction rates. As shown in Fig. **8,** Ni2P/Fe2P/Fe3O<sup>4</sup> has the smallest diameter of semicircle, corresponding to the smallest charge transfer resistance. Moreover, combining iron oxides and iron-nickel phosphides reduces charge transfer resistance. Thus, compared with the pristine components, Ni2P/Fe2P/Fe3O<sup>4</sup> has a higher kinetic activity and a smaller polarization effect. This is attributed to the rose-like structure with abundant active sites and easy electron transport. The results of the electrochemical impedance measurements are consistent with the polarization curves and Tafel slope.

**Fig. 8** Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy plots of Ni2P/Fe2P/Fe3O4, Ni2P, Fe2P, and Fe3O4. Another important consideration in evaluation of the performance of catalysts is the stability. As shown in **Fig. 9A**, chronoamperometric test was used to measure its stability and the applied voltage was 1.62 V (vs. RHE). The current density of Ni2P/Fe2P/Fe3O<sup>4</sup> decreased for approximately 20% after 8 hours. As to the oxygen bubble accumulation and liberation, the recorded i-t curves show an emblematical zigzag feature. The stability of the catalyst was evaluated by testing after 1000 CV cycles and compare with the initial state. The catalyst showed high durability. The polarization curves were essentially superimposed with the initial values (**Fig. 9B**), and the overpotential slightly increased compared with the original. These long-term test results indicate that Ni2P/Fe2P/Fe3O<sup>4</sup> can be used to catalyze OER with high stability.

#### **Conclusion**

The rose-like composite material of Ni2P/Fe2P/Fe3O<sup>4</sup> was synthesized via a facile approach, including a solvothermal step and low temperature phosphatization step. Compared to the pristine components, a current density of 10 mA·cm-2 was obtained with Ni2P/Fe2P/Fe3O4at a lower overpotential of 365 mV, and Ni2P/Fe2P/Fe3O<sup>4</sup> has a much smaller Tafel slope of 59 mV·dec-1 . Moreover, the rose-like rough morphology provides Ni2P/Fe2P/Fe3O<sup>4</sup> with more active sites and channels for electronic transport, enhancing the catalytic performance. Ni2P/Fe2P/Fe3O4exhibits high durability for OER. Therefore, the inexpensive, stable and efficient catalyst has high potential for replacing noble metal-based catalysts in OER.

#### **Experimental Section**

Sodium hypophosphite (NaH2PO2, 99.0%) was purchased from Union Chemical Industry (Chengdu, China). All chemicals were applied without any further treatment. Ultrapure water was used in all of the experimental processes.

**Synthesis of Ni2P/Fe2P/Fe3O4.** The Ni2P/Fe2P/Fe3O<sup>4</sup> composite was synthesized by two steps, a solvothermal step and a low temperature phosphatization step. These two processes are described as follows:

Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (0.29 g), Fe(NO3)3·9H2O (0.40 g), urea (0.30 g), and NH4F (0.12 g) were dissolved in 40 mL ultrapure water and subjected to intense magnetic stirring for 5 hours at ambient temperature. Then, the mixture was transferred into a Teflonlined autoclave. The reaction was performed at 120 °C and completed after 10 hours. When the autoclave cooled down, the precursor was cleaned three times by using ultrapure water and absolute ethanol, respectively. The obtained precursor was named as FeNi-bimetallic hydroxides. After being washed, the precursor FeNi-bimetallic hydroxides were vacuum dried at 60 °C for 8 hours. Then, the precursor FeNibimetallic hydroxides were placed at the downstream side in a porcelain crucible boat of tube furnace, while NaH2PO2(1.00g) were in the upstream side. Because hydrogen phosphide gas would be produced in this process and result in the loss of phosphorus, NaH2PO<sup>2</sup> needs to be excessive. The tube furnace was heated at 370 °C for 2 hours under Ar atmosphere. After cooling to ambient temperature, the black material was collected. The product was named Ni2P/Fe2P/Fe3O4. For comparison, Fe2P and Ni2P were synthesized by similar method without adding Ni(NO3)2·6H2O and Fe(NO3)3·9H2O, respectively. Fe3O<sup>4</sup> was annealed under the air atmosphere by the identical steps without adding Ni(NO3)2·6H2O.

**Characterization.** Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed from 10° to 80°, which operated at 40 kV and 100 Ma and used copper Kα-radiation (λ = 1.548 Å). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was carried out on JSM4800 (JEOL, Japan). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed with JEOL2100F (JEOL, Japan). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed by using ESCALAB 250Xi (Boyue, Shanghai, China). An Oxford Link ISIS energy-dispersive spectrometer was used to acquire the energy dispersion spectra (EDS). The Brunner-Emmet-Teller (BET) surface area and pore sizes of the compounds were measured by Micromeritics ASAP 2460 system.

**Electrochemical test.** A three-electrode system was used as the test system on CHI760E electrochemical workstation. In the three-electrode system, the reference electrode was an Ag/AgCl electrode, the counter electrode was a platinum plate, and the working electrode was glassy carbon (GC) rotating disk electrode (RDE) coated on the catalyst. The three-electrode system consists of two loops. One is composed of reference electrode and a working electrode while the other is composed of counter electrode and working electrode. Typically, 4 mg of the product powder, 1000 μL ethanol and 20 μL Nafion solution were ultrasonically mixed for 30 minutes, and a homogeneous mixture was obtained. Afterward, 10 μL of the mixed solution was dropped onto GC rotating disk working electrode and the electrode was dried. 1.0 M KOH solution was used as the electrolyte solution. Since the reference electrode used was a saturated Ag/AgCl electrode, it can be calibrated into a standard reversible hydrogen electrode scale on the basis of the Nernst equation for the sake of unify standards. And the equation can be expressed as follows:

E vs. RHE=E Ag/AgCl+0.059pH+0.199

Therefore, the OER overpotential (η) of samples are:

$$\eta$$
= E <sub>vs. RHE</sub> -iR-1.23V

Based on the concentration polarization and electrochemical polarization of the electrode surface, the overpotential can be divided into concentration overpotential and electrochemical overpotential. Diffusion of ions can be accelerated through intense rotation or increasing the working temperature, in order to reduce the concentration overpotential. Suitable electrocatalysts can significantly reduce the electrochemical polarization. In order to mitigate the possible negative effects of oxygen bubbles, such as covering active sites or material shedding, 900 r/min rotational speed was used in the whole test.

Prior to the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) test, 20 cycles of cyclic voltammetry (CV) were used for initial activation. Once a stable CV curve was obtained, the sweep speed was reduced to 5 mV/s to obtain the polarization curve. LSV measures the instantaneous response current density of the working electrode by applying a voltage linearly varying at a certain speed on the working electrode. The Tafel plot was obtained with a speed of 1 mV/s. The parameters for the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were set as follows: the frequency change from 0.01Hz to 10-5 Hz with a 5 mV sinusoidal voltage. Finally, the CV curves were collected to calculate effective electrochemical active area, and half the slope of the fitting curve was the value of double-layer capacitance.

#### **Table of Contents Text**

We synthesized rose-like nanocomposite of Fe-Ni phosphides/iron oxide as efficient catalyst for oxygen evolution reaction. And the catalyst performs well in catalyzing oxygen evolution reaction, with a very low overpotential of 365 mV to reach 10 mA·cm-2 current density. Ni2P/Fe2P/Fe3O<sup>4</sup> has a large double-layer capacitance and is very stable for long-term use. Therefore, the Ni2P/Fe2P/Fe3O<sup>4</sup> catalyst has high potential for oxygen evolution reaction.

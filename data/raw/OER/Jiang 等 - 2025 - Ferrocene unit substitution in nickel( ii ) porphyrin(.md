# Ferrocene unit substitution in nickel(II) porphyrin(2.1.2.1) induces an extremely low oxygen evolution reaction overpotential†

This study reports the synthesis, characterization, structure and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance of ferrocene-substituted nickel(II) porphyrin(2.1.2.1) complexes. The Ni-3 complex, functionalized with two ferrocene units, demonstrates exceptional OER activity, achieving an overpotential of 280 mV at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> in alkaline media. This enhancement is ascribed to the electron-rich ferrocene moieties, which act as efficient electron-transfer mediators during catalysis. DFT calculations corroborate these findings, revealing a theoretical overpotential of 0.79 eV for the dual-ferrocene-substituted catalyst. These results underscore the critical role of ferrocene in lowering the overpotential of molecular OER catalysts.

### Introduction

The oxygen evolution reaction (OER), a critical anode process in green energy production, relies on the first-row transition metal complexes, particularly nickel (Ni)-based systems, which have emerged as promising OER catalyst candidates in alkaline media due to their natural abundance and high catalytic efficiency.2 Among these, Ni(II) porphyrin complexes stand out as structurally versatile molecular catalysts. Their tunable coordination environments (such as Ni-N4 and Ni-NxCy systems), robust electrocatalytic performance, and compatibility with porphyrin free bases—natural ligands for Ni centers position them as compelling candidates for OER applications (Fig. 1). $^{3}$ 

However, OER research on porphyrin-based complexes remains underexplored, primarily due to the synthetic challenges associated with designing novel porphyrin ligands tailored for Ni-based OER catalysts.3b,c Moreover, achieving a low overpotential is a critical benchmark for evaluating the practical viability of OER catalysts. 4 Prior research has demonstrated that substituent effects in porphyrin-based catalysts, spanning the OER, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR), and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), profoundly influence their catalytic efficiency.<sup>5,6</sup> For instance, strategically integrating electron-donating substituents into porphyrin ligands, as observed in metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), can enhance OER activity by optimizing electronic and steric properties. 6a Consequently, developing Ni-porphyrin complexes with electron-rich substituents at meso-positions represents a promising avenue for advancing OER catalysis, offering opportunities to engineer molecular systems with tailored activity and stability.

Dalton Transactions Paper

In this work, we report the synthesis, structure and OER capacity of ferrocene-substituted nickel(II) porphyrin(2.1.2.1) complexes (Fig. 1). Their structures and optical and electronic properties are well verified by high-resolution mass spectrometry (HR-MS), nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), X-ray crystallography, UV-Vis absorption, and electrochemistry. Furthermore, the OER performance of these complexes was systematically evaluated through density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

### Results and discussion

#### Synthesis and characterization

Ferrocene-substituted nickel(II) porphyrin(2.1.2.1) was synthesized by condensation and complex formation reactions (Scheme 1).5d,e,7 2 equiv. of o-dipyrrolylbenzene (DPB) reacted with 1 equiv. of pentafluorobenzaldehyde and 1 equiv. of ferrocenecarboxaldehyde in CH2Cl2 with 3 mol% BF3·OEt2 as an acid catalyst for 3 h, followed by oxidation with 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-p-benzoquinone (DDQ) for 1 h. After the organic solvents were removed, the obtained crude was stirred in a CHCl<sub>3</sub>/MeOH mixture at room temperature with an excess of Ni(OAc)<sub>2</sub>·4H<sub>2</sub>O and NaOAc for 8 h. Finally, the crude product was purified through silica gel column chromatography to get the desired products Ni-2 and Ni-3 in isolated yields of 6% and 9%, respectively (Scheme 1). The di-pentafluorophenyl-substituted nickel(II) porphyrin(2.1.2.1) Ni-1 was also isolated in 8% yield. 5d The HR-MS spectra of Ni-2 and Ni-3 exhibit molecular ion peaks at m/z = 843.0783 [M + H]<sup>+</sup> (calculated for  $C_{46}H_{25}F_5FeN_4Ni = 842.0702 [M]^+$  and  $m/z = 861.0866 [M + H]^+$ (calculated for  $C_{50}H_{34}Fe_2N_4Ni = 860.0836 [M]^+$ ), respectively (Fig. S1 and S2, ESI†).

To reveal the molecular structures of Ni-2 and Ni-3, the NMR spectra were recorded in CDCl<sub>3</sub> (Fig. 2, S3–S5, ESI†). The number of proton resonances of the pyrrole and the ferrocenyl groups of Ni-2 and Ni-3, observed at 6.1 and 7.4 ppm and 4.3 to 5.0 ppm, respectively, allowed a clear identifi-

cation. The protons of the ferrocenyl fragments of Ni-2 and Ni-3 were observed as three multiples with relative intensities of 2/2/5 (Fig. 2a and b). However, compared with the  $\beta$ pyrrole hydrogen atoms of Ni-1,<sup>5d</sup> the  $\beta$  pyrrole hydrogen atoms of Ni-2 and Ni-3 were seen to resonate at a lower field, with the maximum chemical shifts observed at 7.38 ppm for Ni-2 and 7.28 ppm for Ni-3 (Fig. 2a and b). The largest chemical shift difference between them is 1.24 ppm for Ni-2 and 1.10 ppm for Ni-3, which are remarkably larger than that of Ni-1 (0.38 ppm).<sup>5d</sup> The more deshielded  $\beta$  pyrrole protons of Ni-2 and Ni-3 were due to the through-space interaction between the Cp (cyclopentadienyl) ring protons and adjacent β pyrrole protons.8 The 19F NMR spectrum of Ni-2 shows four sets of signals assigned to the o-F, m-F, and p-F of its single pentafluorophenyl group (Fig. S5, ESI†). The HR-MS and NMR spectra of two ferrocene-substituted nickel(II) porphyrins (2.1.2.1) strongly support their successful synthesis.

The molecular structure of ferrocene-substituted nickel(II) porphyrin(2.1.2.1) was confirmed through single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis (Fig. 2c and crystal data in the ESI†). Single crystals of Ni-3 were obtained by slow diffusion of n-hexane into a solution of CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> containing Ni-3. X-ray crystal structure analyses of Ni-3 showed that the two ferrocene units are both facing one side, but due to the small space between two dipyrrin units, the two ferrocene units cannot be located on one line. The shortest distance between protons of adjacent Cp rings is 2.72 Å, indicating a H- $\pi$  interaction between the cyclopentadienyl (Cp) moieties.9 This interaction stabilizes the syn-conformation of the two ferrocene units, directing them to face the same side of the porphyrin plane. The distances between metal ions are 5.07(2), 6.20(3), and 6.34(2) Å (Fig. 2c), as determined from single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. The four N atoms and Ni(II) ions of Ni-3 formed a square

planar geometry. The bond lengths of the Ni(II) ions and N atoms of Ni-3 are 1.882(3), 1.876(3), 1.875(3), and 1.875(3) Å.

The optical and electronic properties of the obtained Ni-2 and Ni-3 were investigated by UV-Vis-NIR absorption spectroscopy and electrochemistry in CH2Cl2 at room temperature (Fig. S6a, ESI†). Similar to pentafluorobenzo-substituted nickel (II) porphyrin(2.1.2.1) Ni-1, $^{5d}$  Ni-2 and Ni-3 showed main broad absorption bands at 532 and 545 nm, respectively. Ni-3 showed weakly red-shifted absorption compared to Ni-2. The redox properties of Ni-2 and Ni-3 were determined through cyclic voltammetry (CV) (Fig. S6b and c, ESI†) with different scan rates (Fig. S7-S10, ESI†) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) experiments in CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>. Ni-2 and Ni-3 exhibit redox potential peaks: -1.33, -1.03, 0.64, and 1.00 V (vs. SCE) for Ni-2 and -1.37, -1.14, 0.65, 0.97, and 1.21 V (vs. SCE) for Ni-3. According to previous studies by Kadish, 10a Saveant, 10b Nocera, 10c Brückner, 10d Zhang, 10e and our work, 5d the first reduction wave of Ni-2 and Ni-3 is assigned to the reduction of Ni(II) to Ni(I). The first reduction wave of Ni-3 is negatively shifted compared to that of Ni-2, and the reason for this is that the electron-withdrawing pentafluorophenyl is absent in Ni-3.<sup>5d</sup> Our previous work reported that Ni-1 exhibited two reduction waves and one oxidation wave;<sup>5d</sup> however, Ni-2 showed two reduction waves and two oxidation waves. The extra oxidation wave of Ni-2 is due to the one introduced ferrocene unit. 5a Compared with the oxidation wave potential of Ni-1, the first Ox. (0.64 V (vs. SCE)) wave of Ni-2 occurs on the meso-linked ferrocene unit. Accordingly, the two ferrocene units of Ni-3 result in two reduction waves and three oxidation waves, and the first Ox. (0.65 V (vs. SCE)) and the second Ox. (0.97 V (vs. SCE)) waves occur on the two meso-linked ferrocene units.5a

OER inks were prepared by loading Ni-1, Ni-2 and Ni-3 onto carbon nanotubes (CNTs) to obtain Ni-1@CNT, Ni-2@CNT and Ni-3@CNT. 11 The morphologies of Ni-1@CNT, Ni-2@CNT and Ni-3@CNT inks were evaluated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and mapping images (Fig. 3, S11 and S12, ESI†), which showed no clear aggregation of Ni-1@CNT, Ni-2@CNT and Ni-3@CNT. The mapping images showed that C, N, Ni, and Fe are uniformly distributed on Ni-1@CNT, Ni-2@CNT and Ni-3@CNT, confirming the successful synthesis of Ni-1@CNT, Ni-2@CNT and Ni-3@CNT. The typical Ni(II) and Fe(II) signals of Ni-1@CNT, Ni-2@CNT and Ni-3@CNT were investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Fig. 3 and S11-S15, ESI†). The high-resolution XPS spectra of Ni 2p1/ 2 and Ni 2p3/2 showed peaks at 872.5 and 854.9 eV for Ni-1@CNT, at 873.9 and 855.9 eV for Ni-2@CNT and at 879.2 and 859.7 eV for Ni-3@CNT, respectively, corresponding to Ni(II). 12 The high-resolution XPS spectra of Fe 2p1/2 and Fe 2p3/2 showed peaks at 721.1 and 708.9 eV for Ni-2@CNT and at 721.2 and 709.0 eV for Ni-3@CNT, respectively, corresponding to Fe(II). 13 The SEM, mapping and XPS results confirmed the synthesis of Ni-1@CNT, Ni-2@CNT and Ni-3@CNT inks.

The OER performance of Ni-based molecular electrocatalysts was evaluated using a standard three-electrode cell in 1.0 M KOH aqueous solution. Ni-3 (281 mV at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>) exhi-

bits an excitingly lower overpotential than Ni-1 (362 mV at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>) and Ni-2 (350 mV at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>) (Fig. 4a and b), which is mainly attributed to the introduced electron-rich ferrocene units, and Ni porphyrin provides a continuous electron transfer capability during the OER process, thus giving

the catalyst excellent OER performance. 6a The Tafel plots of Ni-3 (49.8 mV  $dec^{-1}$ ) are also much lower than those of Ni-1  $(70.2 \text{ mV dec}^{-1})$  and Ni-2  $(67.4 \text{ mV dec}^{-1})$  (Fig. 4c). The electrochemical surface areas (ECSAs) of Ni-1, Ni-2 and Ni-3 were evaluated through charging the double-layer capacitance  $(C_{\rm dl})$ with a simple cyclic voltammetry (CV) method at 0.85-1.05 V (vs. RHE) with different scan rates (10-50 mV s<sup>-1</sup>) (Fig. S17 and S18, ESI†). As shown in Fig. 4d, the current density is linear with the scan rate at 0.95 V. The  $C_{\rm dl}$  values of the as-prepared molecular electrocatalysts are very similar due to the fact that their carriers are all CNTs, and their exposed active area is similar at the same loading level. This proves that the difference in the OER performance of the as-prepared molecular electrocatalysts mainly stems from the difference in their intrinsic activities. To explore the charge transfer in the OER process of different samples, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was conducted over frequencies ranging from 10<sup>5</sup> to 1.0 Hz to investigate the electrode kinetics in 1.0 M KOH. The Nyquist plots (Fig. 4e) obtained indicate that the charge transfer resistance ( $R_{ct}$ ) of Ni-3 (48.1  $\Omega$ ) is the smallest compared to that of Ni-1 (156.2  $\Omega$ ) and Ni-2 (89.4  $\Omega$ ), demonstrating the enhanced charge transfer of the Ni-3 molecular electrocatalyst with more ferrocene. The chronoamperometry (CA) test of Ni-3 showed a substantially stable current density at 15 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> for more than 20 h (Fig. 4f). The evaluation of the electron utilization rate of Ni-3 in the OER process can effectively explain the performance. Therefore, the Faraday efficiency (FE) of Ni-3 was tested. The FE was measured at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> for 2 h, and it was calculated as 95.3% (Fig. S19, ESI†). This result indicates that almost all the currents are used for O2 evolution. The above results prove that Ni-3 shows superior activity to the other similar molecular electrocatalysts reported.2,3

Compared to other square-planar Ni( $\pi$ ) porphyrin complexes, **Ni-3** demonstrates good OER activity and stability. For instance, Ni( $\pi$ ) porphyrin MOFs<sup>5d</sup> and Ni( $\pi$ ) phthalocyanine<sup>2c</sup> exhibit higher overpotentials (320 mV and 410 mV) and lower FE values (89% and 82%), highlighting the critical role of ferrocene substitution in enhancing both electronic and structural robustness. The dual-ferrocene design in **Ni-3** not only facilitates electron transfer but also stabilizes the Ni-N4 active sites *via* H- $\pi$  interactions, as evidenced by its unchanged crystal structure after 20 h of electrolysis (Fig. 4f).

To deeply understand the OER performance of Ni-1, Ni-2 and Ni-3, DFT calculations were performed. The typical four-electron OER reaction mechanism was considered in this work.<sup>14</sup> The calculated free energies of each OER step occurring on Ni centers of Ni-1, Ni-2 and Ni-3 are shown in Fig. S20–S22 (ESI†). The calculated free energy diagrams of the OER process at 1.23 V vs. RHE following the proposed mechanism are displayed in Fig. 5. According to the calculation, the step of OH\* to O\* on Ni centers has the largest energy barrier to overcome for Ni-1, Ni-2 and Ni-3. This step can be considered as the rate-determining step (RDS) with an overpotential of 1.11 eV (Ni-1), 0.91 eV (Ni-2) and 0.79 eV (Ni-3), respectively. The DFT calculation result indicated that the two ferro-

cene unit substituted OER catalyst Ni-3 shows the best OER performance, *via* an activation barrier lower than that of Ni-1 and Ni-2; therefore, ferrocene unit substitution in nickel(n) porphyrin(2.1.2.1) as a molecular catalyst induces a low OER overpotential.

# Experimental

#### Instrumentation and materials

Absorption spectra were measured with a JASCO UV/VIS/NIR spectrophotometer V-670. <sup>1</sup>H NMR and <sup>19</sup>F NMR spectra were recorded on a JNM-ECX 400 spectrometer (operating at 400 MHz for <sup>1</sup>H and 376 MHz for <sup>19</sup>F) using the residual solvent as the internal reference for  ${}^{1}H$  ( $\delta = 7.26$  ppm in CDCl<sub>3</sub>) and CF<sub>3</sub>COOH as the external reference for  $^{19}$ F ( $\delta$  = -76.5 ppm). The APCI-FT-MS mass spectrum was recorded on a ThermoFisher Scientific spectrometer. Cyclic voltammetry was conducted in a solution of 0.1 M TBAP in CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> (distilled from CaH under reduced pressure) with a scan rate of 0.1 V s<sup>-1</sup> in a N<sub>2</sub>-filled cell. A glassy carbon electrode and a platinum wire were used as a working and a counter electrode, respectively. A saturated calomel electrode (SCE) was used as a reference electrode. Other organic solvents and chemicals were of reagent grade quality, obtained commercially and used without further purification. Single crystals of the obtained molecules were obtained by the slow diffusion of n-hexane into their CH2Cl2 solution. A suitable crystal of Ni-3 (CCDC 2379786†) was selected, and data were recorded on a Bruker D8 VENTURE PHOTON II diffractometer. The crystal was kept at 100 K during data collection. For Ni-3, using Olex2,15 the structures were solved with the SHELXT16 structure solution program using Intrinsic Phasing and refined with the SHELXL16 refinement package using Least Squares minimisation.

pared electrocatalysts on nickel foam (NF), a graphite rod and Hg/HgO as the working electrode, counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively. To 1.0 mL of freshly distilled acetonitrile were added 1.0 mg of CNTs, 1.0 mg of Ni-1, Ni-2 or Ni-3, and 25 µL of Nafion (5.0 wt%, DuPont). The resulting mixture was sonicated using an ultrasonic cleaner for 30 min to get an ink. Then, 4 µL of the suspension was dropped onto the surface of a freshly polished glassy carbon electrode. After drying at room temperature, the prepared glassy carbon electrodes were used for electrochemical studies. 1.0 M KOH solution was bubbled with N<sub>2</sub> for 30 min before analysis. The electrolysis of Ni-1@CNT or Ni-2@CNT or Ni-3@CNT was performed with a three-electrode H-type cell containing a Nafion membrane (Nafion®117, DuPont, Inc.) to separate the carbon paper (0.5 cm<sup>2</sup>, loaded with catalysts) working electrode and the other two electrodes.

#### General synthesis

A solution of DPB (416 mg, 2.0 mmol), ferrocenecarboxaldehyde (214 mg, 1 mmol) and pentafluorobenzaldehyde (195 mg, 1 mmol) in 100 mL of  $CH_2Cl_2$  was bubbled with  $N_2$ for 5 min, and then BF<sub>3</sub>·OEt<sub>2</sub> (3 mol%, 8.6 mg, 0.06 mmol) was added to the reaction mixture. The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 3 h under N<sub>2</sub> in the dark. DDQ (448 mg, 2.0 mmol) was added to the reaction mixture, which was stirred for 1 h. After the organic solvents were removed, the obtained crude was stirred in a 180 mL CHCl<sub>3</sub>/MeOH (5/1) mixture at room temperature with an excess of Ni(OAc)2·4H2O and NaOAc overnight. After the organic solvents were removed, the obtained crude was purified by alumina column (CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>) and silica gel column chromatography (n-hexane:  $CH_2Cl_2$  = 2:1) to collect the nickel. Porphyrin complexes Ni-1, Ni-2, and Ni-3 were obtained in 8% (65.9 mg, 0.08 mmol), 6% (50.5 mg, 0.06 mmol), and 9% (77.5 mg, 0.09 mmol) yields as red-brown solids, respectively.

### Conclusion

Two ferrocene-substituted nickel(II) porphyrin(2.1.2.1) complexes were synthesized, and their OER capacity was investigated. Their molecular structures were well verified by HR-MS,

NMR and single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. Ni-3 substituted with two ferrocene units exhibits a robust OER performance with an overpotential of 280 mV at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> under basic conditions, which is attributed to the ferrocene units acting as efficient electron transfer intermediates. DFT calculations indicate a theoretical overpotential of 0.79 eV for the Ni-3 OER catalyst. This work indicates that ferrocene can effectively reduce the overpotential of OER molecular catalysts.

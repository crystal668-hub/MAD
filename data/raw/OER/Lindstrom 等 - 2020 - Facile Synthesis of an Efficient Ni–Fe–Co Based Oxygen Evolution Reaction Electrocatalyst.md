Electrolytic water splitting offers energy storage and conversion opportunities, yet the slow kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction requires the incorporation of catalytic materials. Herein, we present a facile method for the synthesis of a low-cost Ni-Fe-Co material that efficiently catalyzes the oxygen evolution reaction. A mixed transition metal electrocatalyst was synthesized using a nickel-plated iron substrate and a low concentration cobalt reagent. The catalyst was able to achieve competitive current densities (>130 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>) and still exhibit a low overpotential of 0.30 V at the benchmark current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. The Ni-Fe-Co catalyst was stable and maintained its activity during 24 h of electrolysis in alkaline media. The catalyst was also stable when maintained in ambient conditions for 90 days. This is the first reported oxygen evolution reaction catalyst that exhibits these competitive characteristics and that was synthesized using an environmentally-conscious, one-step process that can be manufactured on an industrial scale.

Hydrogen gas produced through electrolytic water splitting could serve as a renewable energy carrier in an ideal carbon-neutral energy system. However, an intrinsic issue of electrolytic water splitting is the slow reaction kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) that limits the practical applications of water electrolysis. The slow reaction kinetics of the OER is due to the complexity of the reaction mechanism.<sup>2</sup> The multistep mechanism is still not fully understood and agreed upon; however, it is apparent that electrocatalysts are required to facilitate the OER to reduce associated energy losses. As a result, there is significant interest in developing innovative, low-cost electrocatalysts for the OER that can be incorporated into industrialscale processes.<sup>3,4</sup> The most efficient OER catalysts for acidic media are based on platinum group oxides (PGOs)<sup>5</sup>; but, these systems are undesirable due to the cost and scarcity of PGO catalyst materials.<sup>6-9</sup> However, many 3d transition metal oxide catalysts have equally good performance in alkaline media in comparison to PGOs in acidic media. Of these catalysts, onset overpotentials as low as  $\sim$ 0.2 V at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> have been observed along with high current densities due to their enhanced kinetics.<sup>2,10–16</sup> Therefore, transition metal-based catalysts are being developed for use in alkaline systems because of the abundance and inexpensive nature of these metal precursors.

A notable example of a binary transition metal electrocatalyst is the nickel-iron electrodeposited composite catalyst reported by Lu and Zhao, which provides high current densities in alkaline media. Furthermore, mixed transition metal oxides (MTMOs)<sup>14,18–21</sup> and transition metal incorporated perovskites, <sup>10,22–24</sup> hydroxides<sup>25–29</sup> and (oxy)-hydroxides<sup>13,19,30–33</sup> are being explored for water electrolysis applications due to their stability and electronic properties. An example of a promising Cu and Fe incorporated catalyst is the quadruple perovskite (CaCu<sub>3</sub>Fe<sub>4</sub>O<sub>12</sub>) investigated by Yagi et al. that displayed stable OER activity after 100 consecutive polarization cycles, which is a significant improvement compared to its predecessors. In addition, a ternary MTMO Ni-Fe-Co catalyst was investigated by Bates et al. and the results suggested that the incorporation of Co activated the catalyst through the formation of conductive NiOOH during OER catalysis. <sup>20</sup>

A highly scalable synthesis method through vapor-fed flame aerosol synthesis (VFAS) route was demonstrated to prepare Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> and Fe<sub>x</sub>Co<sub>3-x</sub>O<sub>4</sub> films as OER catalysts that showed an overpotential of 295 mV, and a Tafel slope of 38 mV/dec.<sup>34</sup> All the OER over potential values reported in this section pertain to a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> (geometric area) unless specified otherwise. A spinel core-shell configuration consisting of NiCo<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> nanowire/MnO<sub>x</sub> nanoflake hybrid structure exhibited an OER over potential of 342 mV with a Tafel slope of 64 mV/dec. 35 The OER over potential for the NiCo<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> on a stainless steel support without the MnO<sub>x</sub> shell was 386 mV with a Tafel slope of 73 mV/dec. NiCo<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> nanowire core—Ni<sub>x</sub>Co<sub>y</sub> layered double hydroxide (LDH) shell on to Ni-foam support exhibited low OER over potentials in the range of 193-247 mV with different x and y values of the LDH. The NiCo<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/Ni<sub>0.796</sub>CoLDH showed the lower end of over potential at 193 mV with a Tafel slope of 37.59 mV/dec. 36 Another nanosheet/ nanowire composite structure consisting of NiFeOx/CuO exhibited an OER over potential of 265 mV @ 100 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. 37 Bae et al. 38 reported a Ni-Co nanowire 3D network on a carbon fiber woven fabric using a hydrothermal method that showed an OER overpotential of 302 mV and a Tafel slope of 43.6 mV/dec.

Noble metal atoms supported on layered double hydroxide (LDH) such Au/Ni,Fe LDH showed an overpotential of 237 mV with a Tafel slope of 36 mV/dec. <sup>39</sup> On the other hand, without noble metal, the pristine Ni,Fe LDH catalyst required an over potential of 263 mV for 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> OER activity with a Tafel slope of 60 mV/dec. Thenuwara et al. <sup>40</sup> prepared Co intercalated NiFe LDH that exhibited overpotentials for OER in the range of 265–322 mV depending on the Co concentration. The turnover frequency (TOF) reported was  $0.106 \, \mathrm{s}^{-1}$ , an order of magnitude higher than that observed for IrO<sub>2</sub>. Amorphous 2D NiFeCo LDH was synthesized by an electrochemical route onto a nickel foam which showed enhanced OER activity with an over potential of 210 mV and Tafel slope of 39 mV. <sup>41</sup> Another amorphous material consisting of Fe-doped  $\beta$ -Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> nanosheets on Ni-foam support showed an OER over potential of 219 mV and a Tafel slope of 53 mV/dec. <sup>42</sup>

The active site on which the OER occurs is not fully understood. Transition metal ions in oxidation states such as  $Fe^{2+}$ , and  $Ni^{4+}$  were considered as active sites for the OER in the NiFe oxyhydroxides. Some studies consider only Fe sites are active ones, <sup>44</sup> while others consider Ni sites are the active sites in the  $Ni_{1-x}Fe_xOOH$ . <sup>45,46</sup> Presence of  $Co^{4+}$  was attributed to the OER activity of the cobalt containing

spinel oxides. 47,48 However, other valence states of cobalt such as  $\text{Co}^{2+49}$  and  $\text{Co}^{3+50}$  were also suggested to be active sites. The higher valence state of transition metal cations as active sites for the OER could be correlated to the OER descriptors such as optimal e.g. filling of surface transition metals closer to unity, and enhanced covalency of M-O bonding as proposed by Suntivich et al. 10 The increased covalency could lead to high formal charges on the metal ions.<sup>51</sup> In contrary to high valency cations, oxygen vacancies are also proposed as active sites for OER by several groups. 52,53 Oxygen vacancies result in lower adsorption energy for water molecules, creating delocalized electrons that enhance the conductivity for better charge transfer, and expose more surface active sites.<sup>54</sup> On the other hand, very high concentration of oxygen vacancies could lead to decreased OER activity as reported by Miao et al.<sup>55</sup> The increase in oxygen vacancies in the double perovskite structure of PrBaCo<sub>2</sub>O<sub>6- $\delta$ </sub>, when  $\delta = 0.5$ , resulted in low spin of Co3+ octahedral ions with an electron configuration of  $(t_{2g}^{\ 6}e_{g}^{\ 0})$ . This lead to the overall e.g. filling of 0.5 which deviated from the optimal value of 1.2 for better OER activity. Furthermore, increased oxygen vacancies weakened the Co 3d—O 2p hybridization that lead to high charge transfer resistance.

During OER, oxygen molecules are produced in triplet state  $(^3\Sigma^-_g)$  which is the ground state. In this state, two unpaired electrons occupy antibonding  $(\pi^*)$  molecular orbitals showing paramagnetic behavior. This triplet state oxygen molecule is produced from the initial singlet bound states on the catalyst surface/interface. The singlet state has spin-paired electrons. Therefore, a spin inversion process is required to produce the triplet oxygen. The over potential for OER could be related to the spin inversion process. The OER catalyst needs to have necessary magnetic transport properties that will allow balancing of the spin of reactants and products, circumventing slow spin-forbidden steps. The conservation of the total spin on the active sites during OER is an important consideration. Crystal planes with the same spin orientation offer convenient spin-selective conduction channels for electrons. Very limited work is reported on spin transport and conservation in catalysis. The conservation is catalysis.

The stability of the catalytic activity and durability of the catalysts are affected by several degradation mechanisms such as passivation of the catalyst supports, oxidative dissolution of the catalysts, poisoning of catalyst surface, catalytic particle growth, and delamination of the catalytic layers. <sup>58</sup> Binninger et al. <sup>59</sup> argued that it is impossible to have stable oxides under OER conditions. These authors suggested that the lattice oxygen is oxidized resulting in lattice oxygen evolution reaction (LOER) in addition to regular OER. The stability of the OER catalysts can be enhanced by decoupling the OER and LOER rates by significantly reducing the mobility of the oxygen ions in the bulk lattice.

Through these studies, it has become accepted widely that MTMO catalysts allow optimal binding energy of adsorbate intermediates, which dramatically increases their effectiveness as OER electrocatalysts. MTMOs generally form under extreme conditions, for example, when exposed to supercritical water<sup>60</sup> or during high temperature calcination processes, <sup>31,61,62</sup> Alternative means of formation include electrodeposition, <sup>63,64</sup> high voltage anodization, <sup>64</sup> modified impregnation methods, <sup>20</sup> and sol-gel methods <sup>65,66</sup>; however, these recognized synthesis techniques can be energy- and labor-intensive. Many of the aforementioned experimental procedures for developing catalytic electrodes also utilize high surface area supports or require the preparation of catalytic inks, which may further increase preparation time and the cost associated with these catalysts. 17,20,22,24,26,28,62,67 The aim of this study was to develop a facile, one-step formation process and the characteristics of an MTMO OER catalyst. In this study, we report a method for low-cost, energy-efficient synthesis of a MTMO material that exhibits high current density and functions as a stable OER electrocatalyst in alkaline media.

#### Methods

**Preparation of the electrocatalyst.**—A 7  $\mu$ m-nickel-plated iron foil, typically used in electronics industry, was used as the substrate

material. The foil was hand polished with 400 grit sand paper and then cut to the desired size. The foil substrate was cleaned ultrasonically in deionized water. A 2 mM Co solution was prepared using Co(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>•6H<sub>2</sub>O and the pH of the solution was adjusted to 7.0 using NaOH. The foil substrate and prepared Co solution were introduced into a Teflon-lined, stainless steel autoclave and heated to 150 °C and held for 72 h. The control sample was prepared using the same methods as described above with pH 7.0 water containing no Co. The samples were allowed to cool to room temperature, rinsed with water, and air dried under ambient conditions before characterization. All chemicals were of analytical grade and materials were purchased from Alfa Aesar and deionized water was used throughout the study.

Physical characterization.—The surface morphologies of the Ni-Fe-Co catalyst were examined using a Hitachi S-4800 scanning electron microscope equipped with an energy dispersive spectrometer (Oxford EDS system). X-ray diffraction patterns were collected using a Rigaku Smartlab XRD with CuK<sub>o</sub> X-rays from  $2\theta = 10^{\circ}$  to  $90^{\circ}$  at a step size of  $0.1^{\circ}$  and a fixed incident grazing angle of 0.5°. The XRD data were analyzed using Rigaku PDXL2 analysis software and were indexed using JCPDS cards. A Thermo Scientific DXR Raman Microscope furnished with a 532-nm laser at 5 mW power was used to analyze Raman active modes. The data were collected using a spot size of 25  $\mu$ m, and a 2D map of 25 points was averaged for analysis. A PHI 5600 model X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS) using a monochromatic Mg  $K_{\alpha}$  excitation source (1253.6 eV) was used to analyze species on the surface of the electrocatalyst. The Ag  $3d_{5/2}$  line at  $368.27 \pm 0.05$  eV was used to calibrate the instrument. The XPS spectra were recorded at 15 kV and 300 W, with an analysis area of 800  $\mu$ m<sup>2</sup>. The survey spectra were acquired at the pass energy of 29.35 eV and narrow scans at 23.95 eV. Charging effects were corrected using the adventitious C 1 s line at 284.8 eV. Gaussian fitting software from XPS International was used for peak fitting using SDP v4.6 after a 3-point smoothing of the data.

Electrochemical characterization.—The electrochemical responses of the samples were recorded in a conventional three-electrode system with Ni-Fe based samples (with geometric surface area of 1 cm<sup>2</sup>) as the working electrodes, coiled platinum wire as the counter electrode, and a Ag/AgCl electrode (saturated KCl) as the reference electrode in aqueous 1 M NaOH solution (pH 13.8) as the electrolyte. The reference electrode was inserted into a Luggin capillary filled with saturated KCl solution to mitigate the stability issues caused by the basic solution. The measurements were conducted under ambient conditions using a Gamry® Reference 600 potentiostat. The voltage was calibrated to reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale using the equation, RHE = EAg/AgCl + 0.197 V + 0.059 pH. Linear sweep polarizations from 1.2-2.2 V vs RHE were conducted at a 5 mV s scan rate for five cycles with iR-compensation. The unreported resistance (measured to be  $\sim 1.5~\Omega$  using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data found in Supplementary Fig. 4 (available online at stacks.iop.org/JES/167/046507/mmedia) was corrected for using Gamry® Framework software which employs a current interruption method. The stability study was conducted by performing a potentiostatic scan at 1.57 V vs RHE to produce a starting current density over 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. The electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) and roughness factor (RF) of the catalyst and a control sample were estimated using the double layer capacitance measurement technique outlined by McCrory et al. 21 The controlled geometric surface area (GSA) of the electrodes was 1.0 cm<sup>2</sup> in a traditional three electrode setup. EIS was run at 10 mV rms AC voltage in the frequency range of 100 kHz to 100 Hz in 1.0 M NaOH electrolyte (Supplementary Fig. S4) The C<sub>DL</sub> was estimated using a simplified Randle's circuit model and a constant phase element (CPE) as an imperfect capacitor. Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) was also used to analyze the surface area of the catalyst relative to the control Ni-Fe foil (see Supplementary Information).

#### Results

## Morphology and chemistry of the Ni-Fe-Co Electrocatalyst.—

After the one-step synthesis process, the Ni-Fe-Co OER catalyst was air dried and then characterized. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) micrographs of the Ni-Fe-Co electrocatalyst, collected to observe the surface morphologies, showed small crystallites of approximately 100–300 nm in diameter (Fig. 1a). As discussed later, these particles were identified as NiCo<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> and Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> spinels<sup>68</sup> based on the energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), XRD, and Raman spectroscopy analyses. The presence of hexagonal morphologies, shown in Fig. 1b, also was observed on the surface at regions that did not have a substantial population of small crystallite features. The larger structures were considered to be  $\beta$ -Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub><sup>69</sup> based on the EDS results. The chemistry of these crystallites was confirmed using XRD, Raman and XPS studies as discussed below.

Without calcination, the presence of crystalline phase NiCo<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> and Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> spinels, along with  $\beta$ -Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> on the catalyst's surface, was detected by XRD analysis. The diffraction pattern of the Ni-Fe-Co-based electrocatalyst is shown in Fig. 2. The diffraction peaks at 36.55° and 44.56° correspond exclusively with NiCo<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (JCPDS 20–0781). The peaks at 32.91° and 51.86° are strongly suggestive of  $\beta$ -Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> (JCPDS 59–0462). Though the diffraction peaks at 30.15°, 35.50°, and 57.09° are representative of Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> spinel (JCPDS 01-089-0691), they also are in agreement with NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> spinel (JCPDS 01-076-6118). Therefore, based on the XRD analysis, it could not be stated conclusively whether the Feincorporated spinel was Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> or NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> due to the overlap of the two diffraction patterns. XRD patterns are shown in Supplementary Fig. S1 for the Ni-Fe-Co catalyst, a control sample that underwent the same synthesis process (described in the Methods section) devoid of Co and the base nickel-plated iron (Ni-Fe) foil. The presence of  $\beta$ -Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> was not observed in the diffraction pattern of the control sample; however, the presence of Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> (hematite) was detected by the diffraction pattern (JCPDS 01-072--6232).

The Raman spectrum of the Ni-Fe-Co-based electrocatalyst, presented in Fig. 3, supported the surface formation of NiCo<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> and Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>. The presence of NiCo<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> spinel was confirmed by the strong Raman features at  $\sim 193~\rm cm^{-1}$ ,  $\sim 467~\rm cm^{-1}$ , and  $\sim 663~\rm cm^{-1}$ , corresponding to the  $F_{2g}$ ,  $E_g$ , and  $A_{1g}$  vibrational modes of NiCo<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>. Primary Raman features at  $\sim 539~\rm cm^{-1}$  and  $\sim 299~\rm cm^{-1}$  were in agreement with the  $F_{2g}$  and  $E_g$  vibrational modes of Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, respectively. The Raman spectrum does not suggest a high surface concentration of NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>. The inference that the primary Fe-incorporated spinel was Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> is reinforced by the XRD and Raman analyses discussed above, as well as by Raman studies on Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> and NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> in the literature. The Broadening of the spectral features of the Eg modes of NiCo2O4 and Fe3O4 may be attributed to overlap of the vibrational modes for the spinels and Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> due to the similarities in spectral features for these compounds.<sup>62</sup> The interpretation of the Raman spectrum obtained from the Ni-Fe-Co catalyst was confirmed using Raman spectra obtained from NiCo<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, and Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> standards as shown in Supplementary Fig. S2. The chemistry of the standards used for comparison in this study were in turn confirmed with not only data reported in the literature and mineralogical databases but also using XRD analyses as shown in Supplementary Fig. S3. 62,70,71,73 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis of the prepared electrocatalyst identified Ni, Fe, and Co on the surface of the electrocatalyst. Figure 4a shows the XPS survey spectrum. The XPS results corroborated the findings of XRD and Raman spectroscopy analyses. A relatively high concentration of Ni was detected on the surface of the catalyst supporting the presence of  $\beta$ -Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> and NiCo<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>. The Fe 2p spectrum, found in Fig. 4b, was peak fitted using fitting parameters previously reported by this group and others. These parameters are provided in Supplementary Table I.60,74 The presence of Fe<sup>3+</sup> and Fe<sup>2+</sup> was identified in a 2:1 ratio, which suggests the mixed-valence Fe spinel, Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>. The presence of Co was observed

clearly in the survey spectrum. The Co 2p spectrum peaks and Ni 2p<sub>3/2</sub> peaks, shown in Figs. 4c and 4d, respectively, matched well with other NiCo2O4 peaks reported in the literature, but they were not peak fitted due to the well-known challenges associated with peak-fitting for this spinel. 61-63,65,75,76 The Ni 2p<sub>3/2</sub> peak at 854.6 eV, and a 2p<sub>3/2</sub> satellite peak at 860.2 eV clearly indicated the presence of nickel in a valence state of Ni<sup>2+</sup>. For reference, peaks from metallic nickel will appear at binding energies of about 852.4 and 858.3 eV for 2p<sub>3/2</sub> and its satellite peak, respectively [data retrieved from https://srdata.nist.gov/xps]. Cobalt peaks were observed at 779.8 eV (2p<sub>3/2</sub>), 784.8 eV(2p<sub>3/2</sub> satellite), and 795.2 eV (2p<sub>1/2</sub>). For comparison, pure cobalt will register peaks at 777.8 eV  $(2p_{3/2})$ , and 793.2 eV  $(2p_{1/2})$ . No satellite peak was reported for pure cobalt in the National Institute of Standard and Technology (NIST, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy Database. Comparison of the data indicated that cobalt was present in a mixed oxidation state of Co<sup>+2</sup> and Co<sup>+3</sup>. The recorded higher binding energies indicated that nickel was oxidized to Ni(II). Overall, the structure of the Ni-Fe-Co electrocatalyst consisted of a composite structure with two fcc spinel phases such as NiCo<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> and Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, and a hcp nickel hydroxide phase  $\beta$ -Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>. The

volume fraction of individual phases was not determined due to overlapping of the peaks between these phases in the diffraction patterns and Raman spectra.

Electrochemical performance of the Ni-Fe-Co.—The Ni-Fe-Co catalyst in this study achieved a high current density of >130 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> at a low overpotential of 0.35 V, as shown in the linear sweep polarization curve in Fig. 5a. The overpotential was 0.30 V at a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, which is a figure of merit for OER catalysts based on a 10% efficient solar cell. 21,77 The stability of the prepared Ni-Fe-Co catalytic electrode was tested in an alkaline environment while catalyzing the OER for 24 h at a constant voltage. The results of the potentiostatic stability study are shown in Fig. 5b. The voltage selected for this study was 1.57 V vs RHE (an overpotential of 0.34 V without iR-compensation) to achieve a current density above 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, which is a benchmarking parameter for OER catalysts, as described above. 21.77 The Ni-Fe-Co

electrocatalyst was able to maintain a current density greater than  $10~\rm mA~cm^{-2}$  for a full day during constant catalysis.

The electrocatalytic activity of the Ni-Fe-Co-based catalyst was compared to the base Ni-Fe foil sample and the control sample. As seen in Fig. 6, a 55% and 62% increase in current density was observed at 1.8 V vs RHE for the Co-incorporated electrocatalyst vs the control sample and the polished base Ni-Fe foil sample, respectively, without iR-compensation. The Tafel slopes for the Ni-Fe-Co catalyst after synthesis and after 90 days of ambient exposure, the control sample, and the Ni-Fe base foil were calculated by fitting the linear sweep polarization data (Fig. 5a) plotted as potential vs the logarithmic current density to a linear model with a  $\sim$ 0.999 correlation using the Tafel equation:  $a + b \log i$ . Figure 7a shows the corresponding Tafel slopes for the Ni-Fe-Co catalyst and Fig. 7b shows the Tafel slopes for the Ni-Fe control sample and base foil. After synthesis, the Ni-Fe-Co catalyst exhibited a low Tafel slope of 47 mV dec which was  $\sim 3$  fold lower than that of the control sample. The overpotential needed to obtain a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> for the Co-incorporated catalyst was  $\sim$ 60 mV and  $\sim$ 80 mV lower than the Ni-Fe control sample containing no Co and the base metal sample, respectively. This lower observed overpotential for the Co-incorporated catalyst correlates to over a 20% reduction in the applied overpotential. The stability of the Ni-Fe-Co electrocatalyst also was examined after extended exposure to ambient conditions. After 90 days of ambient exposure, the same Ni-Fe-Co electrocatalyst experienced only a slight degradation in OER activity corresponding to an 8 mV dec<sup>-1</sup> increase in the Tafel slope, as shown in Fig. 7a, and the overpotential was shifted anodically by  $\sim$ 30 mV.

#### Discussion

In the literature, IrO2 has been considered a benchmarking standard for OER catalysts, however, transition-metal based catalysts such as oxyhydroxides have shown superior kinetics when compared to PGOs in alkaline media. A benchmarking catalyst for alkaline systems is NiFeOOH which has been thoroughly investigated<sup>33,44,78,79</sup>; NiFeOOH has displayed a low overpotential of 0.25 V at a geometrical surface area-based current density of 8 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, reported by Batchellor and Boettcher.<sup>33</sup> The Ni-Fe-Co catalyst in this study exhibited an overpotential only ~50 mV higher than this benchmarking standard and was synthesized using a much simpler method. This Ni-Fe-Co catalyst shows higher activity based on Tafel slope and a lower observed overpotential when compared to  $\sim$ 50% of the catalysts that have been included in the review article by Galán-Mascarós on transition metal-based water oxidation catalysts. 80 Concurrently, many of these catalysts are characterized based on geometrical surface area and utilize high surface area supports, which does not provide information solely based on the nature of the catalytic species present at the catalytic interface. The catalyst reported in this study has a low RF and demonstrates significantly improved kinetics compared to the control sample prepared without Co and the base Ni-Fe foil, as seen from the Tafel slope presented in Supplementary Fig. S6.

The stability of the prepared Ni-Fe-Co electrocatalyst was explored during constant OER catalysis and also after exposure to ambient conditions for an extended time. While catalyzing the OER at a constant overpotential of 0.34 V (corresponding to 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> in Fig. 6), no significant degradation in activity was observed for over 24 h in pH ~14 alkaline conditions, supporting the high stability of this catalyst during the OER. After exposure to ambient conditions for 90 days, a slight increase in overpotential was observed along with a small decrease in the kinetics of the Ni-Fe-Co catalyst corresponding to an increase in Tafel slope of 8 mV dec<sup>-1</sup> (Fig. 7). This is most likely due to the oxidation of surface species to less catalytically active oxides, such as Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. <sup>18,44,81,82</sup> Few studies have tested the ability of the catalysts to maintain their activity beyond 12 h or their stability upon extended exposure to ambient conditions. <sup>17,25,26,28,29,64</sup> Thus, the results presented here are promising with respect to the ambient long-term stability of the

catalyst. The findings reported here suggest that further investigation of the change in catalytic activity after exposure to ambient conditions may be warranted.

The increase in catalytic activity and the high stability that was observed for this Ni-Fe-Co electrocatalyst may be attributed to the presence of two spinels (NiCo<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> and Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>) and  $\beta$ -Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> on the catalyst's surface. Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> (where Fe is only in the +3 valence state) was only observed on the surface of the control sample, which offers an explanation for the slower reaction kinetics of this electrode since it has been reported in numerous studies that high concentration, monovalent Fe-catalysts are not efficient OER electrocatalysts. 18,33,83-85 It was observed that the addition of Co resulted in the formation of NiCo<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> spinel and may have caused the formation of  $\beta$ -Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> and Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> to take precedence over the less-desirable Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. The addition of Co to the Ni-Fe based catalyst may also promote the formation of ion-permeable, conductive NiOOH during OER catalysis which facilitates the formation of active adsorption sites and increases the capability of the electrocatalyst, as described in previous studies. 16,20 Based on these findings, it is suggested that all three of the primary species present on the electrode's surface synergistically enhanced the catalysis of OER. 16,31,66,83,86 Obtaining a greater understanding of the synergy between the formation of NiCo<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> spinel and the selective formation of β-Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> and Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> over Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> may lead to further advancement of this OER catalyst.

Direct comparison of the activity of OER electrocatalysts is challenging due to different preparation techniques and experimental procedures used to characterize these catalysts. 80 It is understood that increase in active surface area of the electrode results in higher observed current which can lead to higher calculated current densities when the geometrical surface area is used to calculate the current density instead of the electrochemically active 3-dimensional surface area. For example, the binary NiFe-DAT (where DAT = 3.5diamino-1,2,4-triazole) catalyst described by Hoang et al. required a low overpotential of 0.27 V to produce a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> in 1 M KOH electrolyte; the NiFe-DAT catalyst can produce high current densities due to increased surface roughness from DAT inhibition during electrodeposition.<sup>25</sup> Further examples of binary transition metal catalysts that have been synthesized with high active surface areas are those synthesized by Li et al. who incorporated Ni and Co into CuO2-nanowires87 and Lu & Zhao who electrodeposited Ni and Fe onto high surface area Ni-foam substrate. The reported roughness factors (RFs) for these catalysts were 20.5 and 50, respectively. Thus, comparison of current densities of various catalysts is not easy and must be made carefully. The RFs of the Ni-Fe-Co catalyst and a control Ni-Fe foil sample used in this work was estimated by EIS and BET analyses. The RF of this catalyst was calculated to be  $\sim$ 2 using the methodology reported by McCrory et al. who also discuss the possible limitations

A 0.06 V decrease in overpotential was observed when Co was incorporated into the electrode vs the control sample.

of using this method and note that large errors may be incurred when this technique and a standard value for C<sub>s</sub> are used.<sup>21</sup> Therefore, BET analysis was also performed to estimate the surface areas of the catalyst and a control sample and to investigate the relative relationship of the surface roughness of these samples. The BET estimated surface roughness of the catalyst was 1.15x that of the control foil which provides further evidence to the low RF of this Ni-Fe-Co catalyst. Supplementary Fig. S5 shows the linear sweep polarization curves for the catalyst and the control sample normalized by ECSA and compares the two methods used to calculate the RFs. Discrepancies in the analyses are discussed in further detail in the Supplementary Information. While comparing the enhancement of catalytic activity due to increased surface area vs the species present at the electrolytic interface continues to be a challenge of this field, the results in this study supports the inference that increased ECSA is not responsible for the overall catalytic enhancement of the Ni-Fe-Co catalyst vs the Ni-Fe foil and that the higher activity must be due to the oxide/hydroxide species formed on the surface. The

current densities based on active surface area for the high RF catalysts mentioned above were compared to the ECSA normalized current density (RF = 2) of this Ni-Fe-Co catalyst at 1.53 V vs RHE. At this voltage, the current densities were  $\sim 3 \text{ mA cm}^{-2}$  and  $\sim 6 \text{ mA}$ cm<sup>-2</sup> for the Ni/Co-CuO<sub>2</sub> and NiFe-NF catalysts, respectively. 17,87 The Ni-Fe-Co electrocatalyst presented here produced a current density of 5 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> and thus exhibits competitive catalytic activity compared to the former two binary catalysts. Ternary electrocatalysts with high surface areas are also being investigated, such as the NiFeCoO<sub>x</sub> amorphous catalyst that was synthesized by Fan et al.<sup>64</sup> This catalyst required a low OER overpotential and exhibited high current densities in 0.1 M KOH. The two-step catalyst preparation reported by Fan et al. used a high voltage (50 V) anodization technique followed by an annealing step to synthesize their competitive NiFeCoO<sub>x</sub>. <sup>64</sup> The RF for this material was not reported but the authors described the catalyst as porous, suggesting a high active surface area after anodization. A possible drawback to this method is that a homogenous Ni-Fe-Co alloy was required as a precursor, which may not be economical when considering this process for industrial scale-up. Other successful Ni-Fe-Co catalysts are layered double hydroxide (LDH) catalysts presented by Long et al.<sup>29</sup> and Zeng et al.<sup>28</sup> that require low overpotentials of  $\sim$ 0.22 and  $\sim$ 0.29 V, respectively, to produce a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. However, the synthesis techniques for these catalysts require secondary steps before they can be used in electrolytic water splitting applications; the catalytic compounds first have to be prepared into inks and then loaded onto conductive supports, thus increasing the hands-on preparation time associated with these catalysts which may make them less feasible for future industrial incorporation. This Ni-Fe-Co electrocatalyst synthesis requires only one step and does not require expensive precursors or supports, which minimizes costs associated with this method.

To further compare our catalyst, works that included similar electrochemical experimental conditions were considered. In the reported study by Jia et al., Ni-Fe nitride nanoparticles (Ni<sub>3</sub>FeN-NPs) were synthesized and compared to Ni<sub>3</sub>FeN-bulk and Ni<sub>3</sub>Fe-MMO materials to determine the difference in activity based on increased active surface area and nitrogen vs oxygen incorporation. <sup>88</sup> The Ni<sub>3</sub>FeN-NP catalyst exhibited a current density of >300 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> at 1.8 V vs RHE compared to Ni<sub>3</sub>FeN-bulk catalyst and Ni<sub>3</sub>Fe-MMO which both produced current densities of ~100 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> at the same potential, indicating the increased surface area of the catalyst in the nanoparticulate form. Under the

same experimental conditions, the catalyst reported here was able to achieve an  $\sim\!10\%$  higher current density at 1.8 V vs RHE than the two bulk binary Ni-Fe catalysts that did not exhibit nanoparticle morphology at the electrolytic interface, perhaps due to activation from Co incorporation, as discussed above.  $^{16,20}$ 

A study conducted by Wang et al. reported a similar hydrothermal synthesis and the formation of  $\rm NiCo_2O_4$  spinel on the surface of FTO substrate, without Fe incorporation.  $^{31}$  In comparison, the ternary Ni-Fe-Co catalyst synthesized in this study exhibited a 20% increased current density at 1.8 V vs RHE along with a  $\sim\!30$  mV lower overpotential at a current density of 10 mA cm $^{-2}$ . The presence of Fe in moderate concentrations on the surface of the electrode is known to enhance the electrocatalytic activity with respect to OER.  $^{18-20}$ 

In addition to evaluating ternary, 1st row transition metal catalysts, Zhang et al. reported a successful FeCoW catalyst loaded onto different substrate materials.<sup>89</sup> The specific activity of the FeCoW and the FeCoW activity on highly conductive, high surface area substrates were evaluated.<sup>89</sup> The most successful of the synthesized catalysts in their study was the non-annealed, FeCoW (G-FeCoW) on Au-plated Ni foam. However, G-FeCoW still showed promising OER activity when loaded onto single crystal Au(111) and FTO glass substrates which are expected to have low RFs. When the catalytic activity of the G-FeCoW catalyst deposited on FTO substrate was compared to this Ni-Fe-Co catalyst under similar experimental conditions, the Ni-Fe-Co ternary catalyst required an equivalent overpotential (0.31 V) to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. The G-FeCoW catalyst also exhibited a current density of  $\sim$ 20 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> at 1.58 V vs RHE, equal to the current density that was observed for this Ni-Fe-Co catalyst at the same potential. Though the Ni-Fe-Co catalyst presented in this work and the G-FeCoW material exhibit similar catalytic activities, it is not conjectured that the high activity of this Ni-Fe-Co catalyst is only due to Fe and Co incorporation. It is possible that octahedral-Co in the NiCo<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> spinel structure may act as active sites for OER catalysis; nonetheless, due to the fact that the Co:Ni ratio on the surface of this catalysts is  $\sim$ 1:3 it is unlikely that Co forms the only active sites. It is hypothesized that Fe and Co also aid in the formation of the conductive NiOOH phase at lower overpotentials and allow for more optimal binding energies of adsorbates on the surface of the catalyst, as discussed by Bates et al.<sup>20</sup> Furthermore, Zhang et al. report that the homogenous incorporation of 3d transition metals is responsible for the increased catalytic activity of the gelled-FeCoW system when compared to discrete oxide phases observed after annealing.<sup>89</sup> Yet other studies suggest that multiphasic systems may also enhance OER activity when compared to single systems, such as the quinary catalyst developed by Haber et al. 90 and the Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>/Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> system investigated by Wang et al. 83

Recently, Xu et al. <sup>91</sup> reported an OER over potential of 270 mV @ 100 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> and Tafel slope of 51.2 mV/dev for electrodeposited NiFe electrocatalyst on to a high surface area nickel foam. Hu et al. <sup>92</sup> reported a 3-D porous NiFeOx/NiFeP framework that was prepared by melt spinning and preferential acid leaching technique as bifunctional electrocatalyst for water splitting. The reported over potential for OER was 210 mV @ 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. A similar OER behavior was reported for an electrodeposited porous 2D NiFeCo hydroxide nanosheets grown on to nickel foam (NF), NiFeCo LDH/NF. <sup>41</sup> It is noted that these recent studies used either a high surface area substrate such as nickel foam or a 3D porous structured electroactive surface. Therefore, it is difficult to discern if the reported low over potential for OER @ 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> (which was based on the geometric area—not ECSA) was due to the enhanced activity of the catalyst or enhanced surface area.

In order to better understand the OER mechanism, *I-t* plots were recorded at two different over-potentials ( $\eta=0.37~{\rm V}$  and 0.6 V or 1.6 and 1.83 V<sub>RHE</sub>) out in different pH conditions. The steady state current densities were plotted as a function of OH<sup>-</sup> concentration as shown in Supplementary Fig. S6. The slopes of the log (i) Vs log [OH<sup>-</sup>] plots give the reaction order. <sup>93</sup> The reaction order based on the

hydroxyl ions,  $m_{OH^-} = \left(\frac{\partial (\log i)}{\partial (\log [OH^-])}\right)$  at two different applied potentials was 1.3, and 0.86 at 1.6 and 1.83  $\ensuremath{V_{RHE}}$  respectively. Lyons and Brandon<sup>94</sup> reported more or less similar values for the oxide covered "aged" iron and cobalt electrodes. At lower over potentials iron oxyhydroxide film showed a Tafel slope of 60 mV/decade and a reaction order of 1.45; and at higher over potential the reaction order  $(m_{\rm OH-})$  was about 1 with a Tafel slope of 120 mV/decade. The aged cobalt oxide electrode also followed a similar trend of revealing two different reaction orders depending on the bias potential.<sup>9</sup> the other hand, nickel based electrode showed a reaction order of unity. 94 Observation of two different reaction orders of the NiFeCo catalyst indicated that the active catalytic sites vary depending on the over potentials. At low over potentials Ni and Fe sites are active, and Co sites are activated at high over potentials. The fractional reaction order observed at low over potential was related to Temkin type adsorption of reaction intermediates that showed different rates of change of free energy of adsorption for different reaction steps with

increase in surface coverage.  $^{94}$ The Tafel slope ( $b = \frac{2.303 \, RT}{\alpha F}$ ) of fresh NiFeCo catalyst was 47 mV/decade which increased to 59 mV/decade after 90 days of

exposure. The change in the Tafel slope could be associated with the change in the transfer coefficient,  $\alpha$ , from an initial value of 1.25 to unity. Based on the Marcus's theory, <sup>95,96</sup> the decrease in the transfer coefficient could be directly related to increase in the total reorganization energy of the redox system.

Supplementary Fig. S7 shows the cyclic voltammogram of the NiFeCo electrocatalyst in 0.1 M KOH. A large anodic wave taking off at 1.35  $V_{RHE}$  with a current peak at 1.43  $V_{RHE}$  was observed during the forward scan. The reverse scan showed two cathodic peaks at 1.34 and 1.28  $V_{RHE}$ . These results were compared with the CV results reported for individual layers of Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>, Co(OH)<sub>2</sub>, and Ni<sub>0.5</sub>Co<sub>0.5</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub> by Nguyen et al. <sup>97</sup> Furthermore, the CV results of this study are comparable to the CV results reported for nickel-iron oxyhydroxide electrocatalysts by Boettcher group. <sup>98</sup> The large anodic current peak, and two cathodic peaks suggest that Co(II) oxidized to Co(III) and Co(IV), and Ni(II) to Ni(III) following the reactions <sup>99,100</sup>:

$$Ni(OH)_2 + OH^- \leftrightarrow NiOOH + H_2O + e^-$$
 [1]

$$Co(OH)_2 + OH^- \leftrightarrow CoOOH + H_2O + e^-$$
 [2]

$$CoOOH + OH^{-} \leftrightarrow CoO_{2} + H_{2}O + e^{-}$$
 [3]

Formation of NiOOH was supported by the post CV test Raman spectroscopy as shown in Supplementary Fig. S8. The peaks observed at ca.  $475-480 \text{ cm}^{-1}$  and  $555-560 \text{ cm}^{-1}$  that can be assigned to the e.g. bending vibration and the  $A_{1g}$  stretching vibration modes, respectively, of Ni–O in NiO(OH). 101 The NiOOH exists in two polymorphs as  $\beta$ -NiOOH that has a welldefined structure (space group: P-3mI), similar to that of  $\beta$ -Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>, but with different stacking sequence, and  $\gamma$ -NiOOH which is a loosely bound turbostratic layered structure with less defined oxidation state.  $^{102}$  Earlier work suggested that  $\beta$ -NiOOH had higher OER activity than  $\gamma$ -NiOOH. <sup>103</sup> However, recent work showed the other way. 44 The low energy Raman peaks at 475 and 555 cm<sup>-1</sup> are considered characteristics peaks of  $\gamma$ -NiOOH, and the peaks at 480, and 560 cm<sup>-1</sup> are assigned to  $\beta$ -NiOOH. The Raman spectrum of the NiFeCo catalysts after OER showed intensive peaks corresponding to  $\gamma$ -NiOOH, and shoulders associated with the  $\beta$ -NiOOH phase as seen in Fig. S8. Oxidation of  $\beta$ -Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> generally leads to formation of  $\beta$ -NiOOH phase and electro-oxidation of  $\alpha$ -Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> results in  $\gamma$ -NiOOH. In this study, presence of  $\alpha$ -Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> was not observed initially. Therefore, formation of  $\gamma$ -NiOOH could be attributed to oxidation of either Fe-incorporated  $\beta$ -Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> or NiCo<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> spinel. Formation of  $\gamma$ -NiOOH from  $\beta$ -Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> had been reported under strongly oxidizing conditions. The average of oxidation state of  $\gamma$ -NiOOH is reported to be 3.5, and ranges between 3.3–3.75. It should be noted that the electrical conductivity of NiCo<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> and  $\beta$ -Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> is low. The electrical conductivity of NiOOH was about 50 times higher than that of  $\beta$ -Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were carried out on the NiFeCo catalyst in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte at a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> at start of the test (referred to as before OER), and after 1 h of oxygen evolution. Supplementary Fig. S9a shows the EIS data in the form of Nyquist plots. The impedance of the catalyst marginally increased after 1 h OER test. The EIS data were fitted with several equivalent circuit models and the one shown in Fig. S9b showed a better fitting with a  $\chi^2$  value (goodness of fitting) less than  $10^{-3}$ . The EIS data showed predominantly a single time constant and a minor adsorption loop. The NiFeCo electrocatalyst consists of a composite structure of mixed phases of NiCo<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, and Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>. The R<sub>2</sub> and Q<sub>1</sub> are related to the resistivity and dielectric behavior of the oxide layer (iron incorporated Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> and Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>) formed on the nickel coated iron. The  $Q_1$  is a constant phase element or a leaky capacitor displaying dispersion of time constants or frequency due to surface roughness. The exponent of the constant phase element, m, accounts for the frequency dispersion when m < 1, and when m = 1 it represents a theoretical capacitor. The catalytic activity will be better when the resistance is low and capacitance (surface coverage) is high. The inductor L<sub>1</sub> represents the adsorption of hydroxyl ions or OH radicals. The values of the equivalent circuit components are listed in Supplementary Table SII. The m value in the range of 0.64 indicates that the NiFeCo catalyst had a relatively rough surface. The R<sub>s</sub> represents the electrolyte resistance that causes IR drop. The R<sub>1</sub> and L<sub>1</sub> marginally decreased after the OER test. The decrease in L<sub>1</sub> after OER could be correlated to consumption of the adsorbed species during the OER. Increased adsorption could increase the resistance for charge transfer. Since R<sub>1</sub> is connected in series with the  $L_1$ , decrease in  $L_1$  will lead to decrease in the  $R_1$ . The  $R_2$  value marginally increased after 1 h of OER test which could be attributed to the decrease in the charge carrier density. It should be noted that the impedance values recorded for the NiFeCo catalyst were much lower than the values reported for aged Fe, Co, and Ni electrodes  $^{93}$  and for Ni<sub>1-x</sub>Co<sub>x</sub>Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>.  $^{110}$  The increased conductivity of the NiFeCo catalyst in this investigation could be attributed to the possible incorporation of Fe in the nickel hydroxide/oxyhydroxide and NiCo<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> spinel even though no direct analytical results are available.

Supplementary Fig. S10 shows the Mott-Schottky plots of the NiFeCo catalyst before and after OER test. The catalyst showed an n-type semiconducting behavior. The initial charge carrier density was calculated to be  $4.7 \times 10^{19}~{\rm cm}^{-3}$ . After OER, the charge carrier density decreased to  $2.7 \times 10^{19}~{\rm cm}^{-3}$ . The flat band potential remained at  $1.12~{\rm V}_{\rm RHE}$ . The charge carriers could be oxygen vacancies or metal cation interstitials. However, the decrease in the charge carrier density after OER indicates that the charge carriers are most probably the oxygen vacancies. The decrease in the charge carrier density could be related to the increase in the impedance after OER test.

The OER mechanism involving lattice oxygen vacancies could be given as 11,24:

$$\Box -M - \Box + OH^- \rightarrow \Box -M - OH + e^-$$
 [4]

$$\Box -M - OH + OH^{-} \rightarrow OH - M - OH + e^{-}$$
 [5]

$$OH-M-OH + OH^- \rightarrow O-M-OH + H_2O + e-$$
 [6]

$$O-M-OH + OH^- \rightarrow O-M-O + H_2O + e^-$$
 [7]

$$O-M-O \rightarrow \Box -M-\Box + O_2$$
 [8]

The above reaction steps illustrate the possibilities of lattice oxygen mediated oxygen evolution reaction in addition to the conventional hydroxyl adsorbate evolution mechanism discussed in the literature.  $^{11,93,94}$  In the above reaction paths the type of M could be either Fe or Ni as there is no consensus on which is more electroactive. A recent study suggested a bifunctional reaction mechanism of NiFeO $_{\!x}$  catalysts wherein Fe acts as an oxygen evolving center while  $\gamma\textsc{-NiOOH}$  act as a hydrogen acceptor.  $^{111}$ 

Comparison of the CV, Raman, and EIS results indicate that the NiFeCo catalyst likely consists of an initial bulk composite structure of NiCo<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> and  $\beta$ -Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> after OER transformed to a surface structure consisting of a mixture of  $\beta$ -NiOOH and  $\gamma$ -NiOOH phases. The conductivity of the catalyst was improved by the incorporation of Fe and Co. These dopants are considered to mitigate the oxidation of Ni to higher oxidation state and therefore stabilize the  $\beta$ -NiOOH phase. However, recent studies demonstrated that  $\gamma$ -NiOOH showed higher OER activity than  $\beta$ -NiOOH. 44,113 It is well known that the  $\gamma$ -NiOOH is a highly disordered structure with intercalation of water molecules that expands the lattice parameter. 106 If OER reaction steps involve lattice oxygen mediation, then oxygen vacancies would be introduced and the "aged" structure could evolve as  $\beta$ -NiOOH. Both the NiOOH phases could exist under equilibrium conditions. Therefore, the high OER activity of the NiFeCo catalyst could be attributed to the presence of mixed  $\beta$ and  $\gamma$  NiOOH phases and its higher electrical conductivity.

The specific mechanism responsible for increased catalytic activity due to possible triphasic interactions on the surface of this catalyst needs to be further investigated. One possibility is that Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> and NiCo<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> promote the formation of conductive NiOOH while also provides active, octahedral metal sites for catalysis, unlike the Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> system. <sup>83</sup> This study is highly promising due to the high performance exhibited by a catalyst that was synthesized using a very simple one-step, low-cost method. The scope of this work was not intended to be a comprehensive study of the mechanistic model of the Ni-Fe-Co OER catalysis observed. It is hypothesized that the presence of the two inverse spinels, NiCo<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> and Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, which both have octahedral geometry sites, may be active sites for the OER activity. 32,67,88 The presence of these two compounds may also encourage the formation of conductive NiOOH from Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> on the surface of the catalyst which could also provide a large number of active sites for OER.  $^{19,20,31,80}$  NiCo<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> and Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> spinels may initiate the OER at low overpotentials while Nicontaining species (like NiOOH) may promote the fast kinetics at higher overpotentials. Furthermore, this catalyst is self-supported on a conductive Ni-Fe substrate which also acted as a precursor material during the synthesis of the catalytic surface species. The interaction between the surface species formed and the bulk substrate may also aid in charge transfer in this system, as described in other studies. 17,114

In summary, the observations reported in this study support the selective formation of an efficient catalyst for the OER. This Ni-Fe-Co electrocatalyst exhibited a current density of >130 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> at 1.58 V vs RHE, which was higher than those reported in similar studies. 31,62 The prepared catalytic electrode also produced a benchmark current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> at a low overpotential of 0.30 V. The Ni-Fe-Co electrocatalyst remained stable during 24 h of constant OER catalysis. Most notably, the method presented here for developing a low-cost, efficient, and highly-stable OER electrocatalyst is incredibly facile. Calcining is an energy-intensive step that was omitted from this procedure because preliminary studies showed that calcination reduced the catalytic activity due to an increase in the rigidity of the crystal structure of the oxides, as reported by other researchers. <sup>17,20,32,64,89</sup> Furthermore, the Ni-Fe-Co catalyst was prepared without the use of high surface area supports, such as Raney nickel or nickel foam, which have been used in other studies 17,20,25,88,89; nonetheless, it might be worthwhile to study the catalytic effect of such materials using this synthesis method to increase the ECSA of this ternary system. Lastly, the catalyst developed in this work can be used "as-is" for electrolytic water splitting after synthesis without the need for conductive additives or the preparation of a catalytic ink, which would allow this method to be feasible in large-scale industrial practices.

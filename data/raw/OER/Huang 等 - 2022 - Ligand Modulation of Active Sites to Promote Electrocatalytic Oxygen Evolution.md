**Rationally designed catalysts hold the key to address the sluggish kinetics of oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, engineering the active sites of such catalysts still faces grand challenges. This study proposes a feasible ligand modulation strategy to boost the OER catalytic activity of cobalt-iron oxyhydroxide ((Fe,Co)OOH). The 2-methylimidazole (MI) ligand coordination on (Fe,Co)OOH reduces the orbital overlap between the Fe/Co 3d and O 2p, which weakens the adsorption to oxygen-containing intermediates and thus facilitates the unfavorable O2 desorption. As a result, the MI ligand modulated (Fe,Co)OOH achieves an excellent OER performance with low overpotentials (230/290 mV at 10/100 mA cm-<sup>2</sup> ) and excellent durability (>155 h). This study provides a novel ligand modulation strategy for the design of OER catalysts.**

kinetics in anodic electrode, that is, the four-electron coupled oxygen evolution reaction (OER).[1–3] At present, the benchmark OER catalysts are noble metalbased oxides such as IrO2 and RuO2; however, they are limited by scarcity and expensive cost.[4–6] Given this fact, the relatively inexpensive and performancepromising transition metal-based catalysts such as Fe/Co/Ni oxohydroxide and oxides are attracting increasing attention.[7–12]

Ligand-modulation of Fe/Co/Ni-based metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) and hydroxides have demonstrated great potential in OER.[13–17] Through ligand modulation, the crystalline structure

and mass/charge transfer behaviors of catalysts could be effectively modified, and enhanced OER performance could be achieved. For example, by a ligand-competition amorphization pathway, Yu et al.[18] reported a nanorod@nanosheet core-shell structured amorphous OER catalyst, consisting of a Fe-rich MOF core, a Co-rich MOF shell, and an amorphous Co(OH)2 nanosheet outer layer. Taking advantage of the 3D amorphous architecture, the obtained OER catalyst demonstrates a small overpotential of 249 mV at 10 mA cm–2. Hou et al.[19] reported the construction of N-doped carbon nanosheet networks with abundant active sites and enhanced charge transfer for OER using the complexes of ZIF-8 and layered double hydroxides as the precursors. Regardless of the research progress, understanding the intrinsic active sites of OER catalyst as well as the structure-performance correlation is still challenging.

Herein, we report a 2-methylimidazole (MI) modulated cobalt-iron oxyhydroxide OER catalyst, (Fe,Co)OOH/MI, with low crystallinity and nanosheet structure. The low-crystalline nanosheet structure maximizes the exposure of active sites and facilitates the mass transfer process, while the MI modulation optimizes the electronic configuration of the catalyst. Specifically, the coordination of MI with (Fe,Co)OOH reduces the orbital overlap between Fe/Co 3d and O 2p, which weakens the adsorption to oxygen-containing intermediates and thus facilitates the unfavorable O2 desorption. As expected, the (Fe,Co) OOH/MI demonstrates ultralow overpotentials of 230/290 mV at 10/100 mA cm–2 and affords more than 155-h durability with negligible decay in OER.

#### 2. Results and Discussion

The construction of (Fe,Co)OOH/MI OER catalyst is depicted in **Scheme 1**. First, rod-like Co-MOF was uniformly grown onto nickel foam (NF) through a solvent-free hot pressing process. Subsequently, the as-prepared Co-MOF was soaked in FeSO<sub>4</sub> solution for several hours, and the (Fe,Co)OOH/MI nanosheet was obtained. The final products are denoted as (Fe,Co)OOH/MI-xh and x represents the soaking time in FeSO<sub>4</sub> solution. The optimized sample with a soaking time of 12 h is designated as (Fe,Co)OOH/MI.

During the soaking in FeSO<sub>4</sub> solution, a series of reactions would happen. First, the hydrolysis of Fe<sup>2+</sup> happens: Fe<sup>2+</sup> + 2H<sub>2</sub>O  $\rightleftharpoons$  Fe(OH)<sub>2</sub> + 2H<sup>+</sup>.<sup>[20]</sup> In the presence of oxygen, the ferrous hydroxide Fe(OH)<sub>2</sub> would be oxidized into ferric oxyhydroxide (FeOOH): 4Fe(OH)<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub>  $\rightleftharpoons$  4FeOOH + 2H<sub>2</sub>O.<sup>[21]</sup> Meanwhile, the dissolution of Co-MOF would happen in the presence of H<sup>+</sup>, leading to the release of Co<sup>2+</sup> and MI.<sup>[22]</sup> A fraction of the Co<sup>2+</sup> would be oxidized to Co<sup>3+</sup> by the dissolved oxygen and ion exchange would occur between the FeOOH and Co<sup>3+</sup> to form (Fe, Co)OOH: 4Co<sup>2+</sup> + O<sub>2</sub> + 2H<sub>2</sub>O  $\rightleftharpoons$  4OH<sup>-</sup> + 4Co<sup>3+</sup>; xCo<sup>3+</sup> + FeOOH  $\rightleftharpoons$  (Fe<sub>1-x</sub>, Co<sub>x</sub>)OOH + xFe<sup>3+</sup>.<sup>[23]</sup> Besides, the insitu generated MI in solution would be chemically adsorbed on the surface of (Fe,Co)OOH (the so-called ligand modulation), leading to the formation of (Fe,Co)OOH/MI.

For X-ray diffraction (XRD, Figure 1a) characterization, all samples were prepared in the absence of substrate to avoid the strong signals from NF. The morphology of substrate-free Co-MOF (Figure S1a, Supporting Information) is similar to that of Co-MOF grown on the NF (Figure S2a, Supporting Information). However, without the participant of NF, the (Fe,Co)OOH/MI-xh samples show more irregular nanosheet morphology (Figure S1b–d, Supporting Information) than the samples grown on NF (Figure S2, Supporting Information). The above results demonstrate that the NF substrate plays an important

role in obtaining uniform self-supporting nanosheets. XRD pattern of the as-obtained Co-MOF shows great similarity to that of ZIF-67 (Figure S3, Supporting Information). The differences in relative intensity are originated from the different morphologies (rod for Co-MOF, dodecahedron for ZIF-67) with different crystal plane orientations. After soaking in FeSO<sub>4</sub> solution for 12 h, the obtained (Fe,Co)OOH/MI shows four sharp peaks at 21.2°, 33.2°, 34.7°, and 36.6°, corresponding to the (110), (130), (021), and (111) planes of  $\alpha$ -FeOOH (JCPDS# 01-081-0462), respectively. [21] The samples with 6 and 18 h reaction time could also be indexed to the  $\alpha$ -FeOOH phase, suggesting the complete transformation from Co-MOF to (Fe,Co)OOH (Figure S4a, Supporting Information).

Raman spectra of (Fe,Co)OOH/MI-xh were compared with those of Co-MOF, MI, FeOOH, and (Fe,Co)OOH (Figure 1b and Figure S4b, Supporting Information). The band at 674 cm<sup>-1</sup> of (Fe,Co)OOH/MI-xh could be attributed to C-CH<sub>3</sub> vibration from MI.<sup>[24]</sup> This band disappears in the spectra of FeOOH and (Fe,Co)OOH, demonstrating the adsorption of MI on the surface of (Fe,Co)OOH/MI. The bands at around 470 and 530 cm<sup>-1</sup> of (Fe,Co)OOH/MI-xh are ascribed to the M-OH/M-O vibrations.<sup>[25]</sup>

Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra of different catalysts were collected to identify the surface functional groups and coordination molecules (Figure 1c; Figure S4c, Supporting Information). The band at 1628 cm<sup>-1</sup> is ascribed to O–H stretching vibration; the bands at 883 and 795 cm<sup>-1</sup> are assigned to the bending modes of M–O/OH.<sup>[21]</sup> The band at around 430 cm<sup>-1</sup> of (Fe,Co)OOH/MI-xh corresponds to the M–N stretching, which is red-shifted compared to that of Co-MOF.<sup>[26,27]</sup> As expected, no peak could be observed at the same position of FeOOH and (Fe,Co)OOH. The spectroscopic results confirm the successful chemical adsorption of MI on (Fe,Co)OOH.

The morphology of (Fe,Co)OOH/MI was identified with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron

microscopy (TEM). SEM image of the (Fe,Co)OOH/MI shows that wrinkled nanosheets are vertically grown on the surface of NF (Figure 1d). The wrinkles can be more clearly observed in TEM (Figure 1e). The lattice spacings are measured to be ≈0.15 and ≈0.25 nm in high-resolution TEM (Figure 1f), corresponding to the (250) and (111) planes of *α*-(Fe,Co)OOH. Agree with the HRTEM results, selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of the (Fe,Co)OOH/MI displays two concentric diffraction rings (Figure 1g). High-angle annular darkfield scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM, Figure 1h) and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) elemental mappings (Figure 1i–m) show that Co, Fe, O, C, and N signals spatially overlap with each other. The uniform distribution of N suggests the homogeneous adsorption of MI in the ligand modulated catalyst (Fe,Co)OOH/MI. The element composition of catalysts was also investigated by inductively coupled plasma emission spectroscopy (ICP; Figure S4d, Supporting

Information). With the increasing of immersion time in FeSO4 solution, the molar ratio of Fe/(Fe+Co) increases from 86.4% for (Fe,Co)OOH/MI-6h to 97.3% for (Fe,Co)OOH/MI-18h. The ICP results suggest that the Co-MOF transforms to (Fe,Co) OOH/MI gradually, and only a small fraction of Co2<sup>+</sup> ions could be oxidized to Co3<sup>+</sup> and participate in the formation of (Fe,Co) OOH catalyst.

SEM images of Co-MOF and (Fe,Co)OOH/MI-*x*h show the evolution from rod to nanosheets (Figure S2, Supporting Information). For comparison, the Co-MOF soaked in the solution without FeSO4 and bare NF soaked in the FeSO4 or FeSO4 + Co(NO3)2 solutions (denoted as FeOOH and (Fe,Co)OOH) have also been prepared (Figure S5, Supporting Information). After 12 h soaking in the solution, the Co-MOF still retains its original appearance, except that its surface becomes a little bit rough (Figure S5a, Supporting Information). For the bare NF soaked in FeSO4 solution, FeOOH nanoparticles grow uniformly on **www.advancedsciencenews.com www.advmat.de**

the surface (Figure S5b, Supporting Information), while the NF substrate remains unreacted.[28] For NF soaked in a mixed solution of FeSO4 and Co(NO3)2, sea urchin structured (Fe,Co)OOH forms on the surface (Figure S5c, Supporting Information).

To better understand the coordination configuration of (Fe,Co)OOH/MI, X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) analysis was carried out. The X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra at Fe/Co K-edge of (Fe,Co)OOH/MI and their references are depicted in **Figure 2**a,b. By comparing the near-edge energy, one can know that the (Fe,Co)OOH/MI has a valence state of III for Fe, just like Fe2O3 and FeOOH (Figure 2a). The Co near-edge of (Fe,Co)OOH/MI is located between CoOOH and CoO (Figure 2b), demonstrating that Co has a mixed valence state of Co(II) and Co(III). That is to say, more electrons are accumulated around the Co site of (Fe,Co) OOH/MI than that in CoOOH. The valence states of Fe can also be verified through X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS; Figure S6, Supporting Information).[29,30] Although XRD results indicate that the (Fe,Co)OOH/MI adopts a crystal structure of *α*-FeOOH, obvious differences can be observed between (Fe,Co)OOH/MI and FeOOH in the XANES. A pre-edge peak at ≈7115 eV appears in (Fe,Co)OOH/MI, indicating distortion of [FeO6] octahedra.[31] The XANES results demonstrate that the coordination environment of Fe in (Fe,Co)OOH/MI is slightly different from that in *α*-FeOOH.

To further reveal the coordination states of Fe and Co, Fourier-transform extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra in R space are presented without phase correction (Figure 2c,d). For the Fe spectra, the peaks at 1.55 and 2.64 Å are assigned to Fe–O and Fe–Fe scattering, respectively. As FeOOH possesses a [FeO6] octahedral coordination configuration, the same configuration in (Fe,Co)OOH/MI can be preliminarily determined by comparing the profiles of (Fe,Co) OOH/MI and FeOOH. The fitting curve based on a built model, in which the MI is coordinated with the Co site of Codoped FeOOH, is provided in Figure 2c, and the detailed fitting results are provided in Table S1 (Supporting Information). The fitting curve overlap very well with the experimental one, firmly validating the [FeO6] octahedral configuration in (Fe,Co) OOH/MI. It should be pointed out that the [FeO6] in the built model is not a centrosymmetric octahedron, which is in accordance with the appearance of pre-edge peak. As for Co K-edge EXAFS, the peak at 1.53 Å is mainly from Co–N and Co–O. Due to the limited resolution and low N content of the sample, it is difficult to differentiate Co–N and Co–O. The highly consistent experiment and fitting results indicate that each Co atom is coordinated with one N and four O atoms (Figure 2d; Table S1, Supporting Information). From the EXAFS results, the structure of MI-coordinated Co-doped FeOOH (also known as cobalt-iron oxyhydroxide) can be determined. When compared to the FeOOH and CoOOH, it is found that both M–O and M–M bonds are elongated after the MI modulation (Table S2, Supporting Information). The M–O/M–M bond elongation may cause the distortion of [FeO6] octahedral building blocks, which in turn lead to low crystallinity. When applied in catalysis, the low crystallinity may realize more exposed active sites.[29] Besides, the (Fe,Co)OOH/MI shows noticeable changes around near-edge structure compared to FeOOH and CoOOH, which imply the possible charge transfer from MI ligand to active metal sites. Such charge transfer may lead to electron excitation from t2g to eg level, optimizing the OER process through modulating the binding with oxygen-containing intermediates.[32,33]

The electrocatalytic OER performances of the as-obtained samples and commercial RuO2 were measured in 1.0 m KOH.

**Figure 3.** a) LSV curves of Co-MOF, (Fe,Co)OOH/MI, and RuO2 in 1.0 m KOH at a scan rate of 5 mV s–1; b) comparison of the overpotential and onset potential of different catalysts ("squares" represent catalysts grow on NF, "circles" present catalysts tested on glass carbon electrode, and "triangles" represent catalysts grow on other substrate such as carbon cloth. See more details in Table S3 (Supporting Information); c) Tafel plots and d) CV current density versus scan rate of different catalysts; e) durability tests of (Fe,Co)OOH/MI in 1.0 m KOH at a constant current density of 10 mA cm–2.

All the electrochemical data were measured in 1.0 m KOH (pH 14) electrolyte and the electrode potentials were converted to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) reference scale via the equation: E(RHE) = E(SCE) + (0.24 + 0.0592 pH). Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves were collected at a scan rate of 5 mV s–1 (**Figure 3**a; Figure S7a, Supporting Information). To minimize the impact of oxidation peaks, the reverse LSV curves were also collected under the same conditions (Figure S7b, Supporting Information). When compared to most other OER catalysts, such as oxyhydroxides, metal organic frameworks, nitrides, chalcogenides, nonmetallic and noble metal based catalysts, the obtained (Fe,Co)OOH/MI demonstrates obvious advantages (Figure 3b; Table S3, Supporting Information) in terms of onset potential (1.40 V) and overpotential (230 mV at 10 mA cm–2). Compared to the Co-MOF, the (Fe,Co)OOH/MI demonstrates an impressively decrease of overpotential at 10 mA cm–2 by ≈200 mV. The measured Tafel slopes are 127, 73, and 97 mV dec–1 for Co-MOF, (Fe,Co)OOH/MI, and RuO2 (Figure 3c), respectively. The (Fe,Co)OOH/MI delivers a competitive Tafel slope, suggesting the fast kinetics (Figure S8 and Table S4, Supporting Information).

Turnover frequency (TOF) based on active site number was calculated to assess the average activity of active sites (Figure S9, Supporting Information). Assuming all the metal ions participate in the OER process, the (Fe,Co)OOH/MI achieves the highest TOF of 0.045 s–1 at an overpotential of 300 mV (Figure S9, Supporting Information). When the active site number is measured from cyclic voltammetry (CV; Figure S10, Supporting Information), the (Fe,Co)OOH/MI still possess the highest TOF of 5.14 s–1 (Figure S9 and Table S5, Supporting Information).

Considering the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) is positively correlated with the double-layer capacitance (Cdl), the Cdl of the electrocatalysts is determined by collecting the CV profiles in the non-Faradaic region (Figure 3d; Figures S11 and S12, Supporting Information). The RuO2 shows a higher Cdl value (12.40 mF cm–2) than the (Fe,Co)OOH/MI (2.40 mF cm–2) and Co-MOF (2.11 mF cm–2), which may stem from its fine nanocrystal size.[34] The Cdl of (Fe,Co)OOH/MI is higher than that of (Fe,Co)OOH/MI-6h (1.64 mF cm–2) and (Fe,Co)OOH (2.30 mF cm–2) but lower than those of (Fe,Co)OOH/MI-18h (3.05 mF cm–2) and FeOOH (4.37 mF cm–2; Figure S11, Supporting Information). It should be pointed out that the Cdl of (Fe,Co)OOH/MI is not the highest. The above results suggests that, the ECSA and catalytic performance are not always positively correlated,[35] and the high OER catalytic activity of (Fe,Co)OOF/MI can be attributed to its high intrinsic activity, rather than the ECSA. That is to say, only the proper combination of large ECSA and high intrinsic activity would lead to ideal OER performance.

Considering the ECSA would contribute to the current density during the catalytic process, the ECSA-normalized current density is more reliable to explore the intrinsic activity of catalysts and exclude the geometric effect.[36] Thus, LSV and Tafel slope normalized by ECSA are also presented (Figure S13, Supporting Information). After normalization by ECSA, all the (Fe,Co)OOH/ MI-*x*h catalysts display better catalytic activity than the Co-MOF and RuO2. Among the (Fe,Co)OOH/MI-*x*h catalysts, the (Fe,Co) OOH/MI affords the best intrinsic activity with an overpotential of 225 mV at 10 mA cm–2 and a low Tafel slope of 53 mV dec–1.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was also carried out, which reflects the reaction kinetics: a small charge

transfer resistance (Rct) would lead to fast charge transfer. EIS plots (Figure S14, Supporting Information) show that the (Fe,Co)OOH/MI possesses the smallest Rct (0.34 Ω) among all the catalysts, which could expedite charge transport and thus the OER kinetics. This visible improvement in charge transfer may originate from the 2D nanosheet structure, which effectively reduces the charge transfer distance.

Long-term durability is another key parameter to evaluate OER catalysts. The (Fe,Co)OOH/MI yields a stable current density of 10 mA cm–2 for more than 155 h, demonstrating the remarkable durability (Figure 3e). The (Fe,Co)OOH/MI after 20 h stability test was collected and characterized by ex situ SEM, TEM, Raman, and XPS. After 20 h stability test, the (Fe,Co)OOH/MI still remains the nanosheet structure (Figure S15a, Supporting Information). The unchanged Raman spectra (Figure S15b, Supporting Information) and ex situ TEM (Figure S15c–d, Supporting Information) further confirms the structural stability of (Fe,Co)OOH/MI. In addition, the EDX mappings (Figure S15e–j, Supporting Information) reveal the N still distributes uniformly in the sample, suggesting that the OER process does not destroy the MI coordination. Ex situ XPS was used to elucidate the chemical state of the catalyst after OER process (Figure S16, Supporting Information). No significant change has been observed in the Fe 2p XPS spectra, indicating the basic structure of (Fe,Co)OOH/MI remains intact (Figure S16, Supporting Information). The evolution of Co could be confirmed by in situ Raman and corresponding CV (Figure S17, Supporting Information). In specific, the emerging peaks at ≈442 and 550 cm–1 in Figure S17a (Supporting Information) are ascribed to the bending mode and symmetric stretching mode of M–O/OH, respectively. The reversible appearance/disappearance of these Raman bands suggests the reversible redox reaction of Co2<sup>+</sup> ↔ Co3<sup>+</sup> + e– in the catalyst (Figure S17b, Supporting Information).[23]

Encouraged by the outstanding OER activity, an alkaline electrolyzer was assembled for overall water splitting (Figure S18, Supporting Information) using (Fe,Co)OOH/MI as the anode and MoO2-Ni[37] as the cathode. As expected, the as-assembled (Fe,Co)OOH/MI//MoO2-Ni can demonstrate an impressive stability with negligible performance decay for more than 155 h chronoamperometric test at 10 mA cm–2.

The spin-polarized density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out to gain more insights into the structure-performance relationship and performance enhancement mechanism (ISPIN = 2). The magnetic structures of different catalysts have also been provided (Table S6, Supporting Information). The model of (Fe,Co)OOH/MI with exposed (110) plane is built based on Co-doped *α*-FeOOH with MI coordinated to the Co site (**Figure 4**a). The structure rationality has been firmly demonstrated by XAFS results as discussed previously. For comparison, the models of FeOOH/MI and (Fe,Co) OOH/MI-2, in which the MI is coordinated with Fe atoms, are also built (Figure S19, Supporting Information). As the content of Fe is much higher than that of Co (Figure S4d, Supporting

**Figure 4.** DFT theoretical calculation results. a) Top view of (Fe,Co)OOH with MI adsorbed on Co site, where blue, brown, indigo, red, and grey balls represent Co, Fe, N, O, and H atoms, respectively; b) calculated free energy profile of OER; c) charge difference of (Fe,Co)OOH/MI catalyst, where the yellow and blue regions represent electronic accumulation and depletion, respectively; d) partial density of states (PDOS) of potential catalytic sites; e) schematically OER cycle on the (Fe,Co)OOH/MI catalyst.

Information), the Co–O–Co bonds are reasonably ignored in (Fe,Co)OOH/MI. Based on the four-electron-transfer mechanism, the Gibbs free energy (ΔG) of each elementary step for OER was calculated without applying additional potential 0 (U = 0) . As shown in Figure 4b, the first step (\*OH formation) for all samples is a spontaneous process, which might due to the strong absorption derived from the dual site absorbed system; however, all the following steps require external energy to proceed. For both FeOOH and (Fe,Co)OOH, the fourth step (O2 desorption) shows the highest free energy gain (∆*G*<sup>4</sup> = 2.42 and 2.68 eV), suggesting this step is probably the rate determine step (RDS). Interestingly, after the introduction of MI, the energy gain of the forth step decreases sharply to 1.63 eV, which is even lower than that of the third step (2.22 eV). That is to say, the RDS changes from O2 desorption for FeOOH and (Fe,Co) OOH to \*OOH formation for (Fe,Co)OOH/MI. With a Gibbs free energy change (∆*G*3) of 2.22 eV for the RDS, an overall theoretical overpotential of 0.99 V can be calculated for the (Fe,Co)OOH/MI. It should be mentioned that although the calculated theoretical overpotentials deviate from the experimental results, it is reasonable to compare these values qualitatively. The above results indicate that the MI ligand modulation on (Fe,Co)OOH can change the RDS and reduce the theoretical overpotential.

To correlate ligand modulation with overpotential reduction, charge difference of the samples before/after MI adsorption are provided (Figure 4c and Figure S20, Supporting Information). It is found that with the adsorption of MI, the electron density around the Fe (Table S7, Supporting Information) increases obviously. The MI modulation induced electronic structure regulation can be further revealed by partial density of states (PDOS). The overlap of Fe 3d orbital with O 2p orbital (from foreign O-containing species) around the Fermi level increases once Co atoms are introduced into the FeOOH (Figure 4d), indicating the stronger adsorption ability of (Fe,Co)OOH to oxygencontaining species. As the desorption of O2 is the RDS of OER process, the increase in adsorption ability makes the desorption of O2 more difficult, which is responsible for the undesired increase of Gibbs free energy change ∆G4 (Figure 4b). Nevertheless, after the introduction of MI, the orbital overlap between metal and oxygen-containing species decreases, indicating the weakened adsorption ability and thus easier O2 desorption. In addition, although the \*OOH formation has become the RDS of (Fe,Co)OOH/MI, its Gibbs free energy change ∆*G*3 (2.22 eV) is still lower than that of (Fe,Co)OOH (2.42 eV). In order to reduce the error caused by the DFT calculation, the DFT+U calculation is also carried out (Figure S21, Supporting Information).[12] It can be found that, with the modulation from MI, the (Fe,Co)OOH/MI also shows the similar regulation with the lowest overpotential of 1.11 V when compared with FeOOH (1.79 V) and (Fe,Co)OOH (2.30 V). Thus, the MI ligand modulation on (Fe,Co)OOH promotes the OER process through weakening the adsorption to oxygen-containing species and facilitating the O2 desorption.

According to the d-band theory,[38] Fe atoms with lower d-band center possess higher occupancy of antibonding sates and thus weaker adsorption to the intermediates. As shown in Table S7 (Supporting Information), the (Fe,Co)OOH/MI has the lowest d-band center (−1.81 eV), which indicates the weakest adsorption to intermediates and the easiest desorption of O2. In addition, the bond between Co and oxygen-containing intermediates would break due to the steric hindrance from MI (Figure 4e; Figures S22 and S23, Supporting Information), thus favoring the O2 desorption. From the DFT calculations, it could be concluded that the MI coordination can promote the OER kinetics and reduce the overpotential through optimizing the electronic configuration. In specific, it reduces the orbital overlap between Fe/Co 3d and O 2p, which in turn weakens the adsorption to oxygen-containing intermediates and facilitates O2 desorption, the original RDS.

### **3. Conclusion**

In conclusion, a MI-coordinated (Fe,Co)OOH OER catalyst, (Fe,Co)OOH/MI, with nanosheet morphology and low crystallinity has been designed through reconstruction of Co-MOF. The MI ligand modulation reduces the orbital overlap between Fe/Co 3d and O 2p, leading to weakened binding to oxygencontaining intermediates and facilitated O2 desorption. Benefiting from the MI ligand modulated electronic structure, the (Fe,Co)OOH/MI demonstrates ultralow overpotential, low Tafel slope, and robust stability. This facile ligand modulation strategy brings new inspiration to the development of promising OER catalysts.

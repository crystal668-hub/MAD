# Highly Active Core-Shell Carbon/NiCo<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> Double Microtubes for Efficient Oxygen Evolution Reaction: **Ultralow Overpotential and Superior Cycling Stability**

Xiaofeng Zhang, Xiaocui Li, Ruchun Li, Yang Lu, Shuqin Song,\* and Yi Wang\*

Developing highly efficient electrocatalysts with earth abundant elements for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a promising way to store light or electrical energy in the form of chemical energy. Here, a new type of electrocatalyst with core-shell carbon/NiCo2O4 double microtubes architecture is successfully synthesized through a hydrothermal method combined with the calcination process with wet tissues as the template and carbon resource. The outer NiCo<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> nanosheet arrays contain abundant defects, which come from reduction of the carbon in wet tissues. This indicates that carbon is a very excellent defect inducer. The inner carbon microtubes can act as the robust structure skeleton and these core-shell double microtubes provide abundant diffusion channels for oxygen and electrolyte, both of which contribute to improving the stability by avoiding damage to the electrode from produced O2 bubbles and the collapse of the outer NiCo2O4 microtubes. Electrochemical results show that the electrode, core-shell carbon/NiCo2O4 double microtubes loaded on carbon cloth, exhibits prominent electrocatalytic activity with an overpotential of only 168 mV at 10 mA cm $^{-2}$  and a Tafel slope as low as 57.6 mV dec<sup>-1</sup> in 1.0 mol L<sup>-1</sup> KOH. This new type of electrocatalyst possesses great potential in water electrolyzers and rechargeable metal-air batteries.

1. Introduction

Nowadays, human's dependence on energy consumption is increasing with the development of society. However, the nonuniformity of the power supply and the valley-consumption of the power waste a large amount of power. Converting surplus light or electrical energy into chemical energy provides a very effective solution to the above problems. Among these chemical energy, hydrogen energy is the most efficient and clean energy

carrier.[1] So far, among many hydrogen production methods, electrocatalytic water splitting, which involves oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), is regarded as the most promising and sustainable approach with zero carbon emissions and high energy efficiency. However, the efficiency of water electrolysis for hydrogen production has been hampered especially by the sluggish kinetics of four-electron transfer process of OER.[2,3] Consequently, the required potential for practical water electrolysis is considerably larger than the theoretical value of 1.23 V.<sup>[4]</sup> In order to accelerate reaction kinetics for commercial electrochemical applications, many efforts have been devoted to developing efficient electrocatalysts to reduce the overpotential while maintaining the necessary stability.

So far, noble metal oxides such as IrO2 and RuO2 have been known as the most active OER electrocatalysts.<sup>[5,6]</sup> But their commercial applications have been lim-

ited by their earth-scarcity and high cost. It is still highly desired to develop new electrocatalysts with natural abundance, high activity, good stability, and nontoxicity. Recent studies highlight transition metal-based phosphides, oxides, sulfides, selenides, and hydroxides as promising electrocatalysts in OER, such as  $MnO_{2}$ , [7]  $Fe_{2}O_{3}$ , [8]  $Co_{3}O_{4}$ , [9] NiO, [10]  $Zn_{x}Co_{3-x}O_{4}$  [11] and Mn-Co oxides, [12] Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub>, [13] CoNiFeP, [14] CoN, [15] CoP, [16,17] MoNi<sub>4</sub>. [18] Among them, cobalt-based oxides are the most promising electrocatalysts for OER in alkaline electrolytes due to their advantages of low price, easy preparation, and high activity.[19-21] It is reported that the performance of Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> can be further improved by doping with other metals, such as Fe, Zn, Cu, Ni, etc.[22-25] As a model material among them, the spinel NiCo<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> has been extensively studied because of its similar crystal structure while markedly enhanced conductivity and active sites with respect to Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>.[26]

Moreover, electrochemical stability is also crucial for electrocatalysts design. As known to us, in some practical applications, a current density even as high as 250 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> is required to deliver, at which the strong O2 bubble evolution exerts a large shear stress to the electrode, and the stress may cause severe detachment and impair the stability of electrocatalysts.<sup>[27]</sup> Hence, it is highly desirable to design 3D electrocatalysts with abundant gas diffusion channels in both microscopic and

macroscopic scale to release the shear stress by accelerating the mass transfer. Choosing a proper supporting materials is crucial for the synthesis of 3D electrocatalysts. So far, carbon materials, such as carbon nanotubes and graphene, have been widely employed as the supporting materials to synthesize 3D structure materials. [28–30] However, the preparation methods of these carbon materials are rather complex, expensive, and hazardous. Therefore, it's necessary to find substitute supporting material that is easier to prepare and more affordable.

In this work, wet tissues (WTs) are innovatively identified as the template to synthesize double microtubes with carbon and ultrathin NiCo2O4 nanosheet arrays as the inner and outer microtubes, respectively. The corresponding samples are denoted as NCO-X-Air or NCO-X-N2 (X: the treated temperature), respectively. It is found that the carbon in WTs can act as excellent defects inducer, which can induce a large amount of defects into NiCo<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> nanosheets. Furthermore, the pleat-like structure of NiCo2O4 nanosheets and microtubular structure can buffer the strain that induced by phase transformation of the catalysts during electrocatalytic reaction. The double-microtube structure also provides abundant diffusion channels for oxygen and electrolyte. Consequently, the as-prepared electrode consisted of core-shell carbon/NiCo2O4 double microtubes exhibits prominent electrocatalytic activity, fast reaction kinetics, and excellent stability for OER. The present study can not only provide an instructive method for electrocatalysts synthesis, but also bring forward a possible solution for WTs disposal.

#### 2. Results and Discussion

#### 2.1. Characterization

X-ray diffraction (XRD) tests were carried out to analyze the phase composition and the crystal structure. It could be seen in Figure S1 in the Supporting Information that the crystal structure of precursors on the surface of WTs agreed well with that of  $\text{Co}^{2+}_x \text{Ni}^{2+}_y \text{Co}^{3+}_{1-x} \text{Ni}^{3+}_{1-y} (\text{OH})_a (\text{NO}_3)_b (\text{CO}_3)_c \cdot n$   $\text{H}_2\text{O}$ . [31] After calcination under different temperatures and atmospheres, the XRD patterns of the samples were shown in **Figure 1**. In order to correct the position of diffraction peaks,  $\text{TiO}_2$  powders, which belonged to tetragonal crystal system with a=b=3.776 Å, c=9.486 Å and  $\alpha=\beta=90^\circ$  (PDF#73-1764),

were added into sample powders, corresponding to the diffraction peak at 26°. After calcination in air, the crystal structure of NCO-400-Air and NCO-600-Air was a typical spinel structure. The three peaks were recorded, indexing to the (311), (400), and (440) planes of NiCo2O4, respectively. These diffraction peaks were in good agreement with the standard diffraction peaks of NiCo<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (PDF # 20-0781) (Figure 1a), which belonged to cubic crystal system with a = b = c = 8.114 Å and  $\alpha = \beta = 90^{\circ}$ . When the calcination atmosphere was N2, the temperature had a significant effect on the sample composition and structure. Clearly, NCO-400-N2 had the same crystal structure as that of NCO-X-Air. But there were two more peaks located at  $2\theta$ of 19° and 31°, which were assigned to (111) and (220) of NiCo<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, respectively. While, when the calcination temperature was increased to 600 °C in N2, the diffraction peaks of NCO-600-N<sub>2</sub> were the same as the standard diffraction peaks of metallic Ni (PDF#65-0380) and Co (PDF#15-0806) with lattice parameters of a = b = c = 3.535 Å,  $\alpha = \beta = 90$  ° and a =b = c = 3.545 Å,  $\alpha = \beta = 90^{\circ}$ , respectively. The reduction of NiCo<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> to Ni and Co in the case of NCO-600-N<sub>2</sub> could be due to that in the inert N2 atmosphere at high temperature, reductive agents like C could be produced from WTs. As known, NiCo2O4 had better OER electrocatalytic activity than metallic Ni and Co because of better electronic structure for the adsorption of OH-.[32] Moreover, the diffraction peaks of NCO-400-N2 had obviously transferred into higher angle compared with those of NCO-400-Air (Figure 1a), indicating that there was lattice stress remaining in NCO-400-N<sub>2</sub>.[33] Further enlarging the XRD results between 40 and 50° of  $2\theta$  (Figure 1b), the  $2\theta$  angle of NCO-400-N2 was bigger, suggesting a smaller lattice distance than that of NCO-400-Air. Based on the XRD results, the strain in lattice could be calculated according to (Equation (1))[33,34]

$$2d \sin \theta = \lambda \\ \varepsilon = \frac{d_1 - d_2}{d_1}$$
 \rightarrow \varepsilon = \left| 1 - \frac{\sin \theta\_1}{\sin \theta\_2} \right| \times 100\%

Here,  $\varepsilon$  represents the strain in crystal lattice,  $d_1$  represents the crystal distance of NCO-400-Air,  $\theta_1$  represents the diffraction angle of NCO-400-Air,  $d_2$  is the crystal distance of NCO-400-N<sub>2</sub>, and  $\theta_2$  is the diffraction angle of NCO-400-N<sub>2</sub>, respectively.

According to XRD results and Equation (1), the strain in lattice of NCO-400-N<sub>2</sub> was calculated to be 0.82%. Theoretically, ideal crystal structure did not have any defect and all atoms

were in the balanced and correct lattice points. So there was no stress in the ideal lattice. However NCO-400-N2 had the strain up to 0.82%. Generally speaking, the elastic strain limit (δe) of oxides should be very small. Unfortunately, until now, there was hardly report about the exact δe value for oxides. On the other hand, it was reported that Ni–Ti–O based metal-oxides formed on superelastic shape memory NiTi alloys had a less than 0.1% elastic strain,[35] the bulk elastic strain limit of ferroic oxides is 0.1%,[36] and Al alloys had elastic strain limit less than 0.5%.[37] So it could be easily inferred that the strain of NCO-400-N2 did not mainly come from elastic strain, but from huge numbers of lattice defects.

The commercial WTs were a thin layer of nonwoven cloth woven from uniformly distributed and columned fibers without agglomeration with the diameter of about 11.0 µm (Figure S2, Supporting Information). The ordered texture structure and smooth surface of wet tissue fibers (WTFs) meant that they could be adopted as the excellent substrate for the crystallization nucleation of NiCo2O4 precursors. After successively being washed with 1.0 mol L<sup>−</sup>1 HCl, acetone, and absolute ethanol, the residual oil and residues on the surface of WTFs could be removed. Accordingly, the adsorbability and hydrophilicity of surface could be further modified.

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of WTFs with NiCo2O4 precursors were shown in **Figure 2**. A layer of NiCo2O4 precursors with nanosheet-like structure was densely coated on the surface of WTFs, which were cross-linked and homogeneously distributed (Figure 2a,b). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images in Figure 2c,d could further confirm the above 2D nanosheet–like structure. Moreover, it was observed that the NiCo2O4 nanosheets had a pleat-like structure of graphene. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) image (inset of Figure 2d) showed that the NiCo2O4 precursors were of polycrystalline structure.

After the further calcination treatment at different temperatures in different atmospheres, the samples presented different morphologies and compositions. As shown in Figure S3 in the Supporting Information, NCO-400-N2 still kept fibrous structure and did not ruin into pieces. Moreover, the tip of some fibers exhibited hollow and microtubular structure with no agglomeration between the microtubes (Figure S3b, Supporting Information). The enlarged SEM image in Figure S3c in the Supporting Information showed that NiCo2O4 in NCO-400-N2 was composed of the same uniform nanosheet arrays as its precursors. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) spectrum of NCO-400-N2 in Figure S3d in

the Supporting Information suggested that NCO-400-N2 was composed of carbon, oxygen, cobalt, and nickel elements with a large amount of carbon judging from the much higher peak intensity of EDS. Both TEM (**Figure 3**a) and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) images (Figure 3b) indicated that NCO-400-N2 had double microtubular structure with large space between these two microtubes. According to the results of EDS in Figure S3d in the Supporting Information and TEM image in Figure 3, one could speculate that the inner microtube of double microtubes was composed of carbon. In order to check this speculation, NCO-400-N2 was etched by 0.5 mol L−1 HNO3. SEM images (Figure S4a, Supporting Information) and EDS (Figure S4b, Supporting Information) of the residual confirmed the existence of inner carbon microtubes of NCO-400-N2. Further compared with the untreated WTFs, the diameter of carbon microtubes had contracted in some degree. The structure of carbon in NCO-400-N2 was hollow and micro-

tubular (Figure S4c, Supporting Information). SAED spectrum in the inset of Figure S4c in the Supporting Information was a circle of typical diffuse scattering halo, indicating that the carbon in NCO-400-N2 was amorphous with low graphitized degree. Moreover, as shown in Figure S4d in the Supporting Information, the inner carbon microtubes were composed of cross-linked carbon sheets, which could help to improve diffusion path for electrolyte ions and oxygen, and thus decreasing mass transfer resistance of electrode and enhancing the utilization of electrocatalysts. Based on the above analysis, one could conclude that the inner carbon microtubes could act as skeleton to strengthen the flexibility and integrity of the materials. TEM images of the outer part of NCO-400-N2 in Figure 3c,g confirmed that NiCo2O4 remained the 2D nanosheet–like and pleat-like structure, which would be beneficial for buffering strain caused by phase transformation during electrocatalytic reaction and thus improving stability. Simultaneously, it was

observed that nanosheets were stacked with several layers and had a large number of pores, which ensured that NCO-400-N2 had big specific surface area.

The EDS elemental mapping images in Figure 3d–f proved the existence and the uniform distribution of oxygen, nickel, and cobalt in NCO-400-N2. Lattice fringes of high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) in Figure 3h were short-range ordered. Meanwhile, a large number of crystal boundaries and subboundaries could be observed. Crystal boundaries belonged to another kind of defects, which could also serve as extra active sites to expose additional catalytic sites. The lattice distance of 0.28 and 0.24 nm was assigned to (220) and (311) of NiCo2O4, respectively. Moreover, some discontinuous crystal planes were also seen, which could be resulted from the absence of atoms. SAED spectrum of NCO-400-N2 in Figure 3i was concentric rings, which suggested that NCO-400-N2 was polycrystalline. The weak diffraction rings with yellow color were assigned to the crystal planes of (111) and (200) of Ni and Co, respectively, showing the existence of a small amount of metallic Ni and Co, which could improve the conductivity of electrode. The obvious diffraction rings with red color were correspondingly assigned to (111), (220), (311), (400), (422), (511), and (440) crystal planes of NiCo2O4.

It could be further seen from atomic force microscopy (AFM) results of NCO-400-N2 in Figure S5a,b in the Supporting Information that the NiCo2O4 nanosheets of NCO-400-N2 were uniformly spread out on the silicon substrate without overlapping. Choosing one of the edges to carry out height analysis, the nanosheet was ultrathin with a thickness of 4.6 nm (Figure S5c, Supporting Information). As known, electrons were transferred to the current collector only through several layer films and there was no significant depletion layer on the surface of ultrathin nanosheets,[38,39] so the ultrathin nanosheets could facilitate electron transfer and thus improving the electrocatalytic performance.

Further increasing the calcination temperature to 600 °C in N2, the morphology and composition of the pyrolysis product (NCO-600-N2) changed a lot. Although NCO-600-N2 was still fibrous and the fibers were rather integrated with almost no space inside (Figure S6a,b,e, Supporting Information). Moreover, it could be seen from Figure S6c in the Supporting Information that the outer nanosheet arrays of NCO-600-N2 had almost been ruined. EDS spectrum (Figure S6d, Supporting Information) suggested that NCO-600-N2 was composed of carbon, oxygen, cobalt, and nickel elements but with very low oxygen content judging from the much lower peak intensity. According to XRD, SEM, and TEM results, it could be concluded that both of microstructure and phase composition of NCO-600-N2 had been changed a lot when the calcination temperature was increased to 600 °C in N2.

When the calcination atmosphere was changed from N2 to air, NCO-400-Air became pieces and was not so integrated (Figure S7a, Supporting Information) as NCO-400-N2, indicating that the oxidative atmosphere could damage the structure of NiCo2O4 coated WTs. Although so, NCO-400-Air still had hollow microtubes with nanosheet arrays on the surface (Figure S7b,c, Supporting Information) with carbon, oxygen, cobalt, and nickel elements inside (Figure S7d, Supporting Information). However, NCO-400-Air had rather low carbon content with respect to NCO-400-N2 by comparing the peak intensity of EDS of NCO-400-Air (Figure S7d, Supporting Information) and NCO-400-N2 (Figure S6d, Supporting Information). TEM and STEM images in **Figure 4**a,b confirmed the hollow and microtubular structure of NCO-400-Air with no obvious residue in the inner part of NCO-400-Air. Then choosing a single nanosheet of outer NiCo2O4 nanosheets of NCO-400-Air to carry out TEM tests as shown in Figures 4c,g, the structure and morphology of NiCo2O4 nanosheets of NCO-400-Air were the same as that of NCO-400-N2. The EDS elemental mapping images (Figure 4d–f) indicated that the composition of NCO-400-Air was uniform. SAED spectrum of NCO-400-Air was also concentric rings (Figure 4i). The whole crystal planes could be assigned to polycrystalline NiCo2O4. While NCO-400-Air had no crystal planes of (111) and (220) compared with the corresponding results of NCO-400-N2 (Figure 3i), which was in according with the results of XRD. HRTEM image of NCO-400-Air (Figure 4h) showed that its lattice fringes were rather ordered with 0.24 nm of the lattice distance, which belonged to (311) of NiCo2O4. Compared with NCO-400-N2, there were no subboundaries inside the crystals, implying that it had less crystal boundaries. All of these demonstrated that NCO-400-Air had fewer defects than NCO-400-N2.Once the temperature was further increased to 600 °C in air, the microtubular and fibrous structure of NCO-600-Air had been seriously ruined, as shown in Figure S8a–c in the Supporting Information. This gave an indicator that the high calcination temperature combined with oxidative atmosphere could almost damage the original structure of precursors. EDS spectrum (Figure S8d, Supporting Information) had no obvious carbon peak, which suggested that NCO-600-Air had little carbon. So NCO-600-Air had no structural support to maintain stability. Moreover, by comparing the digital photographs of NCO-400-Air, NCO-600-Air, NCO-400-N2, and NCO-600-N2 (Figure S9, Supporting Information) after being pressed by tweezer, it could be found that both of NCO-400-N2 and NCO-600-N2 had rather structural strength and flexibility, which could be attributed to the structural support of inner carbon. However, because of the absence of carbon as the structural support, both of NCO-400-Air and NCO-600- Air had rather low integrity and were easily ruined.

According to the above results, the samples treated at 400 °C (NCO-400-N2 and NCO-400-Air) were expected to exhibit better OER electrolytic activity than those treated at 600 °C (NCO-600-N2 and NCO-600-Air) considering from the desirable structure with more defects and more active sites for OER in the former case. In our initial electrochemical evaluation, we also found that the samples treated at 600 °C did exhibit inferior OER activity to ones treated at 400 °C (Figure S10, Supporting Information). So, the further characterization and evaluation would be focused on NCO-400-N2 and NCO-400-Air.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was carried out to study the difference of the atomic composition and the bonding state between NCO-400-N2 and NCO-400-Air. The full-range XPS spectra showed the presence of C, O, Co, and Ni as the main components along with the minor presence of N peaks (**Figure 5**a). The total surface atom content was summarized in Table S1 in the Supporting Information. It could be seen that NCO-400-Air and NCO-400-N2 had almost the same Co 2p and Ni 2p ratios. But what was strange was that 22.5% of carbon content could still be checked out in NCO-400-Air. That

could be probably due to that carbon dioxide in the air atmosphere during calcination could be involved in the reaction and some carbon in the microtubes was not adequately pyrolyzed, which might lead to carbon residue in the sample.

The high-revolution XPS was carried out to investigate the chemical states. In Figure 5b,c, it could be seen that both Ni 2p and Co 2p spectra of NCO-400-Air were best fitted with two spin-orbit doublets and two shakeup satellites using a Gaussian fitting method. The fitting peaks at binding energy of 855.7 and 873.2 eV were ascribed to Ni<sup>2+</sup>, whereas the fitting peaks at binding energy of 854.2 and 872.0 eV were corresponded to Ni<sup>3+</sup>.[40,41] For Co 2p spectra (Figure 5c), the fitting peaks at 781.0 and 796.3 eV were assigned to Co<sup>2+</sup>, while the ones at 779.8 and 795.9 eV were ascribed to Co<sup>3+</sup>.[42] Compared with the peaks of NCO-400-Air, the corresponding peaks of NCO-400-N<sub>2</sub> were wider and more smooth, which meant more chemical states. The Co<sup>2+</sup>, Co<sup>3+</sup>, Ni<sup>2+</sup>, and Ni<sup>3+</sup> peaks of NCO-400-N<sub>2</sub> were

the same as those of NCO-400-Air. While the peaks located at 853.0 and 871.3 eV were ascribed to Ni<sup>0</sup> and the peaks located at 778.8 and 793.8 eV were ascribed to Co<sup>0</sup>,<sup>(35,43,44)</sup> which suggested the existence of metallic Ni and Co. This result was in agreement with the results of SAED (Figure 3i).

According to the high resolution C 1s spectra in Figure 5d, the peaks at 284.8, 285.4, 286.3, 288.1, and 289.1 eV were attributed to C–C/C=C, C–N, C–O, C=O, and O–C=O bonds, respectively. [45] From the chemical bonds content (Table S2, Supporting Information), NCO-400-N<sub>2</sub> had a much higher C–N content (20.78%) than NCO-400-Air (4.2%). This behavior could be explained as follows: the  $\text{Co}^{2+}_x \text{Ni}^{2+}_y \text{Co}^{3+}_{1-x} \text{Ni}^{3+}_{1-y} (\text{OH})_a (\text{NO}_3)_b (\text{CO}_3)_c \cdot n \text{H}_2\text{O}$  precursors had a large number of  $\text{NO}_3^-$ , which could introduce nitro on the surface of carbon. So it was easy to form C–N coordinations during calcination. Comparing these two cases of NCO-400-Air and NCO-400-N<sub>2</sub>, carbon content was higher in NCO-400-N<sub>2</sub>, which could provide sufficient carbon to introduce

nitro. Moreover, under pyrolysis atmosphere of Air, almost all of C–N coordinations of NCO-400-Air were broken by oxygen, while under pyrolysis atmosphere of N2, many C–N coordinations could be kept. Consequently, C–N content in NCO-400-N2 samples was obviously higher than that of NCO-400-Air. The increment in the population of nitrogen groups was beneficial for hydrophilic hydrophilicity promotion.[46] Recently, it had been experimentally and theoretically found that heteroatoms such as N and O played an important role in inducing negative charge on carbon surface, which were contributed to improving the wettability of the interface between electrolyte and electrode, and thus accelerating charge mobility of electrolyte.[47–49]

Further analyzing the oxygen-containing bonds (Figure 5e), both NCO-400-Air and NCO-400-N2 had three oxygen species, marked as O-1, O-2, and O-3, respectively. The O-1 peak at 529.9 eV was a typical metal–oxygen bond.[50] The O-2 peak at 531.4 eV was corresponded to a high number of defect sites with a low oxygen coordination in the materials with small particle size.[51] The O-3 peak at 532.3 eV was ascribed to a multiplicity of physically and chemically bonded water on and within the surface of NiCo<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>.<sup>[52]</sup> It could be obviously seen in Table S3 in the Supporting Information that the content of O-2 bond in NCO-400-N2 was higher than that in NCO-400-Air, further confirming more oxygen vacancies existed in NCO-400-N<sub>2</sub>. In order to confirm that the oxygen vacancies were derived from the reduction of carbon, the calcination time of precursors was further increased to 12h under N2 protection, which was denoted as NCO-400-N2-12. XRD spectrums (Figure S11, Supporting Information) showed that NiCo<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> had completely transformed to metallic nickel and metallic cobalt, which had the completely same component as that of NCO-600-N2. So we could prove that the carbon had reductibility at 400 °C. During inadequate pyrolysis (NCO-400-N2), carbon in WTs was combined with oxygen in NiCo2O4 lattice, which would induce abundant defects in NCO-400-N2. This indicated that carbon was a very excellent defects inducer. The pore properties of NCO-400-N2 and NCO-400-Air were studied and compared by nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms and desorption pore curves (Figure S12, Supporting Information). Both isotherms of NCO-400-N<sub>2</sub> and NCO-400-Air (Figure S12a, Supporting Information) could be described as a type IV isotherm with an obvious hysteresis loop in the relative pressure range of 0.45-1.00, typical for mesoporous inorganic oxides with good pore connectivity. The specific surface area of NCO-400-Air and NCO-400-N<sub>2</sub> was 100 and 80 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. As summarized in Table S4 in the Supporting Information, the total desorption pores volume and the average desorption pores size of NCO-400-Air and NCO-400-N<sub>2</sub> in Figure S12b in the Supporting Information were 0.145 and 0.136 cm<sup>3</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>, 4.55 and 5.52 nm, respectively. These results indicated that both of NCO-400-Air and NCO-400-N2 had high specific surface area and big desorption pores volume, which might be beneficial for exposing active sites and increasing the contract area between reactants, electrolyte, and electrocatalysts during OER process.

According to the above characterization results, the formation process of NCO-400-Air and NCO-400-N<sub>2</sub> could be inferred as shown in **Scheme 1**. First, NiCo<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> precursors were grown on the surface of WTFs through the hydrothermal process. Accordingly, the core–shell structures with inner WTFs and outer NiCo<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> precursors were successfully fabricated (Scheme 1a). Under the pyrolysis conditions (at 400 °C in N<sub>2</sub>), the pyrolysis

process is shown in Scheme 1b. The surface of WTFs would firstly be carbonized with the temperature increasing. Then the inside of WTFs would start to decompose into CO2 and H2O,  $\text{Co}_{x}^{2+}\text{Ni}_{y}^{2+}\text{Co}_{1-x}^{3+}\text{Ni}_{1-y}^{3+}\text{(OH)}_{a}(\text{NO}_{3})_{b}(\text{CO}_{3})_{c}\cdot n\text{H}_{2}\text{O}$ on the surface of WTFs would be transformed into NiCo2O4. After that, the surface carbon of WTFs would be combined with oxygen in NiCo2O4 to form abundant oxygen-containing functional groups. Consequently, the chemical bonds of NiCo2O4 would transform into a kind of intermediate states, some of which were even reduced into metallic Ni and Co at higher calcination temperature. At the same time, a huge amount of defects, which were helpful to increase active sites, would be produced. Finally, the inner carbon would consecutively diffuse to the surface of carbon shell because of the oxygen gradient between inside and surface, which could be interpreted by Kirkendall effect.<sup>[53,54]</sup> So the double microtubular structure would be generated. In the other case with air as the pyrolysis atmosphere, the WTFs would go through the same diffusion process (Scheme 1c). While, there was abundant oxygen to react with the carbon on the inner surface of NiCo<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> nanosheet arrays, and thus forming CO and CO2. The other little part carbon could also be acted as structural support of NiCo2O4 nanosheets. Simultaneously, the inner residual carbon would go on reacting with oxygen in air, and thus leading to the hollow microtubes.

#### 2.2. Electrochemical Characterization

The OER electrochemical performance of the NCO-400-N<sub>2</sub> and NCO-400-Air were systematically investigated. For the comparison, RuO<sub>2</sub> (the commonly used commercial OER catalyst) and carbon cloth (CC, the substrate for catalyst) were also examined. As shown in **Figure 6a**,b, bare CC had little OER electrocatalytic activity, since the largest current density of bare CC even did not reach to 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> in all the investigated potential range. The obtained NCO-400-N<sub>2</sub> and NCO-400-Air possessed higher catalytic activity for OER with lower overpotential of 168 and 217 mV for 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> and greater current density, respectively, which even outperformed those of the state-of-the-art electrocatalysts RuO<sub>2</sub>. Especially, it was noted that compared with NCO-400-Air, the NCO-400-N<sub>2</sub> expectedly had the lowest

LSV polarization curves a), onset potential and overpotential at  $10 \, \text{mA cm}^{-2}$  b); corresponding Tafel plots and fit line of NCO-400-N<sub>2</sub>, NCO-400-Air, RuO<sub>2</sub>, and CC obtained by fixing the scan rate at 5 mV s<sup>-1</sup> in 1.0 mol L<sup>-1</sup> KOH with iR correction c) and comparison of this work and references d).

onset potential of 114 mV, therefore the enhanced OER activity of the NCO-400-N<sub>2</sub> could be dominated by the synergistic effect of more defects and unique double microtubular structure. In addition, Tafel slope was a principal kinetic parameter to realize the electrochemical behavior especially for the rate determining step of the rearrangement and deprotonation of OH<sup>-</sup> at low overpotential regime for OER.<sup>[55]</sup> The Tafel plots in Figure 6c for NCO-400-N<sub>2</sub>, NCO-400-Air, NCO-600-N RuO<sub>2</sub>, and CC were obtained according to Equation (2)

$$\eta = a + b \log j \tag{2}$$

where  $\eta$  was the overpotential, a was the constant, b was the Tafel slope, and j was the corresponding current density.

Obviously, NCO-400-N2 revealed the lowest Tafel slope (57.6 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>), suggesting more favorable reaction kinetics for the OER. As discussed above, compared with NCO-400-Air NCO-400-N2 exhibited significantly better OER activity, which could be due to the following intrinsic reason. It was reported that there were more Co3+ cations in the (110) crystal plane of Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, which were the main OER active sites.<sup>[56,57]</sup> It was also reported that Ni3+-rich surface of Ni-Co oxides was the main redox sites for OER.[54] Since NiCo2O4 had the almost same crystal structure as Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>. [26] So the (110) crystal plane of NiCo<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> had high OER activity because of abundant Co<sup>3+</sup> and Ni<sup>3+</sup> active sites. According to the crystal structure of NiCo<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> in Figure S13 in the Supporting Information, it could be seen that (220) crystal plane was parallel to (110) crystal plane and had the same atomic density and atomic arrangement as (110) crystal plane. So the (220) crystal plane of NiCo<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> should have the same OER activity as (110) crystal plane. Both of XRD (Figure 1) and TEM (Figure 3i) of NCO-400-N2 proved that there existed a large numbers of (220) crystal planes, while for NCO-400-Air (Figure 4i), no corresponding results. So NCO-400- $N_2$  had better OER electrocatalytic activity than NCO-400-Air.

Furthermore, compared with the other reported OER electrocatalysts in Figure 6d and Table S6 in the Supporting Information, including the recently revealed  $\text{Co}_3\text{O}_4$ @GCN tubes, [58] NiCo<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/NiO sheets, [59] CoP<sub>3</sub> nanoneedle array/ CFP, [60] Co<sub>1-x</sub>Ni<sub>x</sub>P<sub>3</sub> nanoneedle array, [61] NiFe-Se/C nanorods, [62] Fe–Mn–O hybrid nanosheets [63] and NiCo<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/r-GO, [64] this work had obviously lower overpotential and faster reaction kinetics, suggesting that NCO-400-N<sub>2</sub> was a promising candidate as an efficient OER electrocatalyst in alkaline solution.

To get further insight into the OER mechanism, the CV (Figure S14, Supporting Information) tests were carried out at a scan rate of 5 mV s<sup>-1</sup>. As shown in the inset of Figure S14 in the Supporting Information, two pairs of redox peaks could be seen. These two oxide peaks located at about 1.32 and 1.38 V was corresponded to the oxidation of Co<sup>2+</sup> (Ni<sup>2+</sup>) to Co<sup>3+</sup> (Ni<sup>3+</sup>) and then to Co<sup>4+</sup> (Ni<sup>4+</sup>), respectively. In turn, the corresponding reduction peaks located at 1.26 and 1.32 V could be ascribed to the reduction of Co<sup>4+</sup> (Ni<sup>4+</sup>) to Co<sup>3+</sup> (Ni<sup>3+</sup>) and then to Co<sup>2+</sup> (Ni<sup>2+</sup>). Based on the above discussion, it could be inferred that OER proceeded in the following steps<sup>[65]</sup>

$$M + OH^- \leftrightarrow MOH + e^-$$
 (3)

$$MOH + OH^{-} \leftrightarrow MO + H_{2}O + e^{-}$$
(4)

$$MO + OH^- \leftrightarrow MOOH + e^-$$
 (5)

$$MOOH + OH^{-} \leftrightarrow M + O_2 + H_2O + e^{-}$$
 (6)

Here, M represented active sites of catalyst.

It was reported that the theoretical Tafel slopes of Equations (3), (4), and (6) were 120, 30, and 20 mV dec<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> , respectively.[66] The Tafel value of NCO-400-N2 in the present work was between 30 and 120 dec<sup>−</sup>1, indicating the ratedetermining steps were the mixing effects of OH<sup>−</sup> adsorption (Equation (3)) and O–H bond breaking (Equation (4)).[67] According to the previous reports,[1] the defects especially oxygen vacancies were of great significance for improving OER performance. Zheng and co-workers[68] had showed a facile method to prepare Co3O4 with abundant defects by treating with NaBH4. Some other works[69–72] had also proved that defects (oxygen vacancies) could be introduced by treating with reducing atmosphere. Accordingly, it could be the similar case for our present work that carbon was acted as the reductant to combine with oxygen in NiCo2O4, which then led to a large number of defects in the NCO-400-N2. The defective surface of NCO-400-N2 could not only change the surface electronic properties and gap states, but also gave distorted structure and molecular level of oxygen porosity, both of which could promote the adsorption of OH− onto the surface of electrocatalysts, and by this way increasing active surface area and accelerating the rate-determining steps (OH− adsorption and O–H bond breaking).[1,73]

In addition, the relative electrochemical surface areas (ECSA) of NCO-400-Air and NCO-400-N2 were evaluated through its double-layer capacitance (*C*dl) at the liquid/solid interface (Figure S15, Supporting Information). The *C*dl value could be obtained by the determination of the non-Faradaic capacitive current (*i*c), which was associated with double-layer charge from the scan-rate (*υ*) of CVs according to Equation (7).

$$i_c = vC_{\rm dl} \tag{7}$$

The *C*dl values for NCO-400-Air and NCO-400-N2 were 7.68 and 11.46 mF cm−<sup>2</sup> as given in Figure S15b,d in the Supporting Information, respectively, which indicated that the NCO-400-N2 possessed bigger ECSA, contributing to its higher OER activity then NCO-400-Air.

Figure S16 in the Supporting Information revealed the Nyquist plots of NCO-400-N2 and NCO-400-Air at a potential of 1.53 V (vs RHE). Both curves contained a semicircle in high frequency region and straight linearity in the low frequency region. The charge transfer resistance (*R*ct) could be calculated by the diameter of semicircle. The straight linearity in the low frequency region represented the diffusion resistance of the reactants or reaction products. It could be seen that the Nyquist plot of NCO-400-N2 electrode had a smaller diameter than that of NCO-400-Air electrode, indicating the lower *R*ct and higher electron transfer kinetics. This could be benefited from high conductivity of inside carbon skeleton and Co/Ni metal in the NCO-400-N2. Meanwhile, the larger slope of NCO-400-N2 than NCO-400-Air represented the faster diffusion rate, implying that the hollow microtubular structure provided an efficient channel for diffusion of ions and oxygen gas.

Stability was another important parameter to estimate the OER electrocatalytic performance. As shown in **Figure 7**, chronopotentiometry tests were performed to record the potential change at a current density of 10 mA cm−<sup>2</sup> . After applying a constant current (10 mA cm−<sup>2</sup> ) for 20 h, no obvious retention drop was observed, implying the superior long-term stability. Generally, during long-term stability of OER, the O2 accumulated on the electrocatalysts surface could prevent the mass transfer of electrolyte. More seriously, strong O2 bubble evolution could produce large shear stresses to the interface between the substrate CC and the coated electrocatalysts especially at high current density, which might cause severe peeling of electrocatalysts from the substrate. In the present work, NCO-400-N2 had been successfully fabricated onto CC, which would not be ruined from the structure expansion and shrinkage from the gas accumulation due to its excellent double microtubular structure providing enough pores and path for O2 to fluently diffuse. Consequently, the active sites could be always exposed during stability test. But the stability of NCO-400-Air was obviously lower than that of NCO-400-N2 (Figure S17, Supporting Information), which further proved the importance of robust structure skeleton of inner carbon and diffusion path for O2. In addition, the pleat-like structure was beneficial for buffering the strain caused by phase transformation during OER, and thus improving the electrode stability. The SEM images of NCO-400-N2 electrode before and after stability test were shown in Figure 7b–e. It could be seen that the morphology of nanosheet arrays kept almost no change after stability test for 20 h, confirming high stability of nanostructure.

Based on the above results, the superior OER electrocatalytic activity and stability of NCO-400-N2 might be mainly attributed to the following advantages: 1) the inside carbon microtubes could be used as structural skeleton to support outer NiCo2O4 nanosheet arrays, which enabled the NCO-400-N2 electrode to have excellent stability; 2) a huge number of defects such as oxygen vacancy and grain boundaries were helpful to increase active sites; 3) the double microtubular structure of carbon and NiCo2O4 and the cross-linked carbon sheets provided abundant diffusion path for electrolyte ion and oxygen gas; and 4) the hydrophilic groups on the surface of carbon could improve hydrophilia between electrode and electrolyte.

# **3. Conclusion**

In summary, NCO-400-N2 with core–shell double microtubular structure had been successfully synthesized by using the WTFs as the template and carbon resource for the first time. The synergistic effects of defects in NiCo2O4 nanosheet arrays, hydrophilic groups existence on the surface of carbon, robust carbon skeleton, and double microtubular structure provided NCO-400-N2 electrode with excellent OER performance. As a result, the NCO-400-N2 exhibited an attractive catalytic activity toward OER with an ultralow overpotential of 168 mV to generate a current density of 10 mA cm−<sup>2</sup> and a small Tafel slope of 57.6 mV dec<sup>−</sup>1. Meanwhile, this work offered a novel strategy for carbon to play role in template, making defects, improving hydrophilicity and supporting structure.

and acetone was purchased from Beijing Chemical Reagent. WTs were the commonly used commercial WTs.

The WTs were cut into 1.0 cm × 1.0 cm pieces and then treated by the successive ultrasonication in 1.0 mol L<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> HCl, acetone, and absolute ethanol for 10 min in each solution to remove the residual oil and other residues on the surface. After that, WTs were washed with deionized water and dried in a vacuum oven at 100 °C overnight. Whereafter, 1.1632 g Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (2.0 mmol L<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> ), 2.3280 g Co(NO3)2·6H2O (4.0 mmol L−<sup>1</sup> ), and 2.4672 g HMT (8.8 mmol L−<sup>1</sup> ) were dissolved in the mixed solution of 40.0 mL deionized water and 20.0 mL absolute ethanol. After magnetic stirring at room temperature for 20 min, 1.4 g of the above treated WTs (about 255 pieces) were added into the above solution and kept immersion for 20 min under ultrasonication so that the surface of WTs was fully wetted by the above reaction solution. The mixture was then transferred into 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and maintained at 90 °C for 6 h. After cooling down to room

temperature naturally, the WTs coated with the green precursors were taken out from the solution, washed with deionized water and absolute ethanol to remove residual precursors and dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C for 24 h. After being pyrolyzed at 400 and 600 °C for 3 h with a heating rate of 3 °C min−<sup>1</sup> in air or high pure N2, and then cooling down to room temperature naturally, the products were obtained.

*Characterization*: The phase composition and crystal structure were studied by a Bruker X-ray diffraction (D8 Focus, 40 kV) equipped with Cu Kα radiation. The microstructure was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (FEI, Quanta 200F FESE, 20 kV) and transmission electron microscopy (JEOL-2100F HRTEM, 200 kV; FEI, TECNAI F30 HRTEM, 300 kV). Atomic force microscopy (Agilent Technologies Keysight 5500) was used to study the edge characteristic. In order to prepare samples for AFM analysis, a drop of suspension composed of samples and absolute ethanol was dropped onto the monocrystalline silicon substrate, and then the substrate was irradiated under the infrared lamp for 20 min. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurement (ESCALAB 250Xi, Thermal Fisher Scientific, US) was performed to analyze the surface species and chemical states of the samples. The surface areas and porous properties were measured by the standard nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms at −196 °C using an automated Micropore gas analyzer ASAP 2020 (Micromeritics Instruments).

*Electrochemical Measurements*: The substrate of working electrode was carbon cloth with an area of 1.0 cm × 1.2 cm. CC was successively treated with acetone and ethyl alcohol under ultrasonic treatment for 5 min, respectively, and then dried at 60 °C under vacuum for 12 h. To prepare working electrode, 5.0 mg catalyst powders, 400.0 µL deionized water, 50.0 µL Nafion (5 wt%), and 550.0 µL isopropyl alcohol were added into a 2.0 mL centrifuge tube. Then the catalyst slurry was ultrasonicated in an ice bath. After ultrasonication for 30 min, the slurry was brushed onto the above treated CC. The mass loading was 0.875 mg cm<sup>−</sup>2. After being dried at 60 °C for 10 min, the working electrode was obtained. For comparison, RuO2 electrode was prepared with the above fabrication process and the same mass loading as the as-prepared catalyst. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), cyclic voltammetry (CV), chronopotentiometry (CP), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were carried out on AutoLab Electrochemical Workstation in 1.0 mol L<sup>−</sup>1 KOH at room temperature with Hg/HgO as reference electrode and graphite sheet as counter electrode, respectively. The current density of CP for stability evaluation was from 10 to 100 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2. The EIS measurements were performed in a frequency range from 10<sup>−</sup>2 to 105 Hz at a potential of 1.53 V (vs RHE) with an amplitude of 5 mV.

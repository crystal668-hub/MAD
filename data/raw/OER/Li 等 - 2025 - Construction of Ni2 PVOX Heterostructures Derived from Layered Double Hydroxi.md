The rational design of cost-efficiency electrocatalysts with longterm durability is highly desirable for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), but still remains certain challenges. Herein, an interconnected Ni2P/VOx heterojunction electrocatalyst based on layered double hydroxides is constructed to facilitate OER process. The hierarchical structure of interacting VOx nanoflowers and Ni2P nanoparticles significantly expand the exposure of active sites and accelerate fast mass transport in the OER process. Theoretical investigations reveal that the strong multi-interface coupling effectively moderate the electronic structure of Ni2P/VOx and promote the electronic conductivity. Thereby, obviously optimize the adsorption free energy and thus enhance the OER kinetics. As expected, Ni2P/VOx achieved remarkable OER performance with a low overpotential of 210 mV at current densities of 10 mA cm−<sup>2</sup> along with long-term durability over 50 h and 1000 cycles. This study provides a promising and simple pathway to construct heterojunction materials for efficient water splitting.

# **1. Introduction**

Electrolytic water splitting for green hydrogen production is considered as one of the prospective methods to address the energy crisis and environmental pollution.[\[1–3\]](#page-6-0) However, the sluggish kinetics and high overpotential of the anode oxygen evolution reaction (OER) involved with four electron coupled process impedes the industrial application of water electrolysis.[\[4,5\]](#page-6-0) Although the precious metal oxides catalysts (RuO2 and IrO2) can significantly reduce the energy barriers for OER process, the high cost and poor stability severely limit their further development. Currently, a variety of earth-abundant transition metalbased OER electrocatalysts, including oxides, sulfides, nitrides, and phosphides[\[6–8\]](#page-6-0) have been widely explored due to their adjustable electronic structures and environmental friendliness. Among them, transition metal oxides (TMOs) have attracted considerable interest for the fascinating physical and chemical properties, low cost, and high stability.[\[9–11\]](#page-6-0) Nevertheless, TMOs-based materials still suffer from low intrinsic catalytic activity and electronic conductivity in comparison with precious metal catalysts.[\[12\]](#page-6-0) Therefore, it is urgently needed to develop cost-efficiency electrocatalysts with long-term durability for sustainable production of H2 via water electrolysis technology.

In recent years, various effective strategies, such as morphology variation, defect engineering, and interface engineering, were used to boost their OER performance.[\[13,14\]](#page-6-0) In particular, the construction of heterojunctions can significantly regulate the electrical conductivity of catalysts and induce effective charge redistribution at the interface, and thus enhancing their low intrinsic catalytic activity and mechanical stability.[\[15,16\]](#page-6-0) To date, TMOs-based heterostructured catalysts, including cobalt oxide, iron oxide, nickel oxide, and molybdenum oxide have been extensively researched. For instance, the Fe2O3/CeO2 and NiMoO4@Mo15Se19/NiSe2 heterostructures achieved ultralow overpotentials of 172 and 195 mV for OER at 10 mA cm−<sup>2</sup> , respectively.[\[17,18\]](#page-6-0) In contrast, vanadium oxides have been relatively underexplored in electrocatalytic field owing to its extremely poor intrinsic conductivity. Besides, the challenge of the synthesis of vanadium oxides with good conformality makes it difficult to realize vanadium oxides-based heterojunctions via a facile method. Despite all this, vanadium oxides possess structural diversity and favorable redox capability, which offer more possibilities for the design and fabrication of electrocatalysts with optimal adsorption energy.[\[19–21\]](#page-6-0) As well known, transitional metal phosphides (TMPs) are towards promising electrocatalyst candidates for water oxidation because of the remarkable electronic conductivity and chemical stability.[\[22,23\]](#page-6-0) Consequently, integrating vanadium oxides with conductive TMPs by strong interfacial interactions is a promising strategy to promoting electrocatalytic performance. The tunable chemical compositions

and topological transformation characteristic of layered double hydroxides (LDHs) have been demonstrated as satisfactory precursors for the construction of heterojunction electrocatalysts with a highly dispersed structures.<sup>[24–26]</sup>

Motivated by the aforementioned considerations, the  $Ni_2P/VO_x$  heterostructure electrocatalyst was synthesized via in situ phosphorization procedure using NiV-LDH as precursor. The hierarchical structure of  $Ni_2P/VO_x$  is interconnected by  $VO_x$  nanoflowers and  $Ni_2P$  nanoparticles, which provide abundant inner surface and fast electrons and mass migration channels promoting the electrocatalytic performance. Electrochemical measurements reveal that the as-prepared  $Ni_2P/VO_x$  exhibits excellent OER activity and good stability with a low overpotentials of 210 mV at 10 mA cm $^{-2}$  and a long-term durability for 50 h at 10 mA cm $^{-2}$ . Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the charge redistributions at the heterojunction interfaces effectively improve the electrical conductivity and optimize the adsorption energy barrier of intermediates, leading to its superior OER kinetics.

### 2. Experimental Section

#### 2.1. Reagents and Materials

All chemical regents were analytically pure. Nickel foam (3.0 cm  $\times$  3.0 cm), Nickel Chloride Hexahydrate (NiCl $_2$ -6H $_2$ O, Macklin), Vanadium Chloride (VCl $_3$ , Macklin), Urea (CO(NH $_2$ ) $_2$ , Aladdin), Potassium Hydroxide (KOH, Macklin), Ruthenium Oxide (RuO $_2$ , Aladdin), and Nafion (C $_{10}$ H $_7$ OH, Beijing Chemical) were purchased without any further purification. The nickel foam (NF) was cleaned by sequential washing with 2.0 M HCl, deionized water, and ethanol multiple times, then dried overnight in oven at 60 °C and ultrapure water with a resistivity of 18.5  $M\Omega\cdot cm^{-1}$  throughout the experiment. The synthesis of electrocatalysts was discussed in detail below.

## 2.2. Synthesis of NiV-LDH

 $\rm NiCl_2\text{-}6H_2O$  (0.60 mmol, 0.142 g), VCl\_3 (0.48 mmol, 0.075 g), and  $\rm CO(NH_2)_2$  (4.00 mmol, 0.240 g) were mixed in  $\rm H_2O$  (30 mL) and stirred for 30 min. Then the resulting solution was transferred to a 30 mL reactor and heated at 120 °C for 12 h. After cooling to room temperature, the sample supported on NF was washed three times with ethanol and water, and then dried for 12 h, giving rise to NiV-LDH.

### 2.3. Synthesis of Ni<sub>2</sub>P/VO<sub>x</sub>

NiV-LDH precursor and NaH $_2$ PO $_2$  (0.300 g) were separately placed in tube furnace and heated at 300 °C for 3 h at a rate of 5 °C min $^{-1}$  in an Ar atmosphere. After cooling to room temperature, Ni $_2$ P/VO $_x$  electrocatalyst was successfully obtained. For comparative analysis, similar samples were synthesized with 0.200 g, 0.250 g, and 0.350 g of NaH $_2$ PO $_2$ .

Nickel phosphide (Ni<sub>2</sub>P) was prepared according to the literature,  $^{[27]}$  while ruthenium dioxide (RuO<sub>2</sub>) and vanadium pentoxide (V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) were obtained commercially. RuO<sub>2</sub>/NF electrode was made by coating the ink (10 mg RuO<sub>2</sub> mixed with 200  $\mu L$  ethanol, 600  $\mu L$  of ethylene glycol and 200  $\mu L$  Nafion solution with adequate ultrasonic treatment) on a piece of NF (0.5  $\times$  0.5 cm²).

#### 2.4. Reference Electrode Calibration

Pre-calibration: Prior to each experiment, the reference electrode was calibrated against a standard reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) in the same electrolyte (1.0 M KOH) by measuring the open-circuit potential. The RHE calibration was performed using a Pt wire as the working electrode. Potential stability: The reference electrode was immersed in the electrolyte for  $\geq$  30 minutes to stabilize its potential. Post-experiment verification: After electrochemical testing, the reference electrode potential was rechecked to confirm no drift occurred during measurements.

#### 2.5. Physical Characterizations

The morphology and microstructure were examined using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, ZEISS Gemini SEM 300) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, FEI-Talos-F200S, and JEOL JEM F200). X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed using a Rigaku D/ max-2400 diffractometer with Cu  $K\alpha$  radiation ( $\lambda=1.54$  Å). The chemical states were determined using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo Scientific K-Alpha).

#### 2.6. Electrochemical Measurements

All electrochemical performance was measured in a three-electrode system using an electrochemical workstation (CHI 760E) in 1.0 M KOH (pH = 14) solution at room temperature. In order to eliminate the effect of nickel oxidation on catalytic performance, the reverse scan LSV curves were conducted at a scan rate of 2 mV s<sup>-1</sup>.[28] The working electrode was the as-prepared catalysts, counter electrode was a Pt foil and Hg/HgO electrode was used as the reference. The potential  $E_{RHE}$  and overpotential  $(\eta)$  were calculated using the following equations:  $E_{\rm RHE}=E_{\rm Hg/HgO}+(0.098+0.059\times {\rm pH})$  V,  $\eta=E_{\rm RHE}$ 1.230 V. The long-term durability of  $Ni_2P/VO_x$  was evaluated through i-t test with a current density at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was conducted at a frequency range of 0.01–10<sup>5</sup> Hz and an AC amplitude of 5 mV. The Electrochemical Surface Areas (ECSA) of the series catalysts were calculated according to the following equation: ECSA =  $C_{\rm dl}/C_{\rm s}$ , where  $C_{\rm s}$  is the specific capacitance per unit area for samples under identical electrolyte conditions. CV curves were measured at various scan rates from 20 to 100 mV s<sup>-1</sup> under the potential window from 0.25 to 0.35 V. To further estimate the intrinsic activity of the catalysts, the turnover frequency (TOF) was calculated using the equation TOF =  $(J \times A)/(4 \times F \times m)$ , where J is the current density (A cm<sup>-2</sup>) at an overpotential of 0.30 V, where A is the electrode area  $(0.5 \times 0.5 \text{ cm}^2)$ , and m represents the moles of active substance loaded on the substrate with the number 4 indicating a four-electron transfer process in OER and F is the Faraday constant (96,485 C mol<sup>-1</sup>).

#### 3. Results and Discussion

As illustrated in Figure 1a, self-supported NiV-LDH nanoflower arrays were grown onto NF substrate by hydrothermal reactions, which was subsequently converted into Ni<sub>2</sub>P/VO<sub>x</sub> catalyst with abundant multi-interface via in situ phosphorization process under argon atmosphere. The as-prepared catalysts were preliminarily determined using Xray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns. The consistent experimental and simulated XRD patterns confirmed the successful synthesis of NiV-LDH precursor (Figure S1a,b). The characteristic diffraction peaks of Ni<sub>2</sub>P are located at

40.7° (111), 44.6° (201), and 47.4° (210) (PDF # 03–0953) (Figure 1b). The peaks located at 26.3° and 63.9° can be assigned to the (120) and (002) planes of VO2 (PDF # 25–1003), while the peaks appeared at 32.9°, 41.2°, and 53.9° can be indexed to the (104), (113), and (116) planes of V2O3 (PDF # 34–0187), respectively. The results indicate the coexistence of Ni2P and the mixed phases of VO2 and V2O3. Furthermore, the microstructure and morphology evolution were characterized by FESEM and TEM. As depicted in Figure 1c, the SEM image of the NiV-LDH precursor exhibits nanoflower morphologies with the average diameter of 500 nm, which are uniformly covered on the NF substrate during the hydrothermal process. Impressively, such a morphology is well maintained even after the phosphidation process to convert into Ni2P/VOx heterojunction material, but with the polyhedral Ni2P nanoparticles attached to the nanoflowers (Figures 1d and S1c). The results indicate that the nickel sources are transformed into Ni2P via in situ phosphidation reaction with PH3 released from NaH2PO2, which would largely expose catalytically active sites. High-resolution TEM (HRTEM) and inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT) images of the selected Ni2P/VOx region further provide strong evidence for the formation of heterojunctions. As shown in Figure 1e, the well-defined lattice fringe with the distance of 0.221 nm corresponds to (111) crystallographic phase of Ni2P, matching well with the XRD result, while the clearly observed lattice spacings of 0.157 nm and 0.195 nm could be attributed to the V2O3 (122) and VO2 (131) planes, respectively. In addition, the heterointerface between Ni2P and VOx is labeled with white dotted line. Moreover, the energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mappings of Ni2P/VOx illustrate that the signals of Ni and P elements primarily enrich in the nanoparticle areas and the O and V elements are mainly located in nanoflower areas (Figure 1f), further confirming the formation of Ni2P/VOx heterostructures with uniformly distributing on NF substrate.

The electronic state and chemical composition of electrocatalysts were analyzed using X-ray photoelectron spectrum (XPS). The XPS survey spectra reveal the coexistence of P, Ni,

O, and V in Ni2P/VOx sample (Figure 2a), which is consistent with EDS results. The high-resolution V 2p spectrum in V2O3 can be deconvoluted into two peaks at 523.9 and 516.7 eV (Figure 2b), which are originated from the V<sup>3</sup><sup>+</sup> 2p1/2 and V<sup>3</sup><sup>+</sup> 2p3/2, respectively.[\[29–31\]](#page-7-0) For Ni2P/VOx material, two new peaks located at 524.5 and 517.0 eV are assigned to the V4<sup>+</sup> 2p1/2 and V<sup>4</sup><sup>+</sup> 2p3/2, respectively, further demonstrating the presence of VO2 and V2O3. [\[32,33\]](#page-7-0) As illustrated in Figure 2c, the Ni 2p spectra display the spin-orbit characteristics peaks of Ni2<sup>+</sup> located at 857.7 eV (2p3/2) and 875.6 eV (2p1/2), indicating the formation of Ni-P bonds, and the two peaks at 862.5 and 880.8 eV correspond to satellite signals. Besides, the other two peaks at 852.7 and 870.1 eV belong to the Ni 2p signal of NF substrate.[\[34,35\]](#page-7-0) Meanwhile, the P 2p spectra show three peaks relating to Ni─P bond at 129.4/130.2 eV and P─O bond at 134.1 eV that caused by surface oxidation (Figure 2d), respectively.[\[36,37\]](#page-7-0) Notably, the V<sup>3</sup><sup>+</sup> 2p binding energies of Ni2P/VOx show a noticeable negative shift of 0.6 eV compared to V2O3. On the contrary, the Ni 2p and P 2p binding energies of Ni2P/VOx exhibits positive shifts of 0.8 and 0.4 eV, respectively, in comparison with Ni2P. The results demonstrate the strong interface coupling between Ni2P and VOx with the electron transferring from Ni2P to VOx in Ni2P/VOx heterojunction, which would significantly enhanced OER performance.

The OER performance of all as-prepared catalysts was evaluated by a three-electrode system at a scan rate of 2 mV s−<sup>1</sup> with iR correction in a 1.0 M KOH solution using Hg/HgO as the reference electrode, Pt plate as the counter electrode, and the catalysts supported on NF as the working electrode. First, the influence of Ni2P on the electrocatalytic performance was investigated with the different NaH2PO2 reaction dosage. As depicted in Figure S2, the overpotential of Ni2P/VOx samples was gradually decreased with the increased content of Ni2P, owing to the abundant heterointerfaces and electrocatalytic active sites.[\[38\]](#page-7-0) However, excessive incorporation of Ni2P would reduce the exposed surface area of VOx and weaken the synergistic interaction between the bi-components, resulting in a negative effect.[\[39,40\]](#page-7-0) Therefore, the Ni2P/VOx sample obtained with the NaH2PO2 reaction dosage of 0.3 g exhibited the lowest overpotential and the smallest charge-transfer resistance value. As illustrated in Figure [3a,](#page-4-0) the optimal Ni2P/VOx catalyst delivered small overpotentials of only 210 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−<sup>2</sup> , which was superior to Ni2P (290 mV) and NiV-LDH (350 mV) (Figure [3b\)](#page-4-0). The electrocatalytic performance of Ni2P/VOx also outperformed the commercial RuO2 (270 mV) and the previously reported catalysts (Table S1), even at a large current density of 50 and 100 mA cm−<sup>2</sup> . Meanwhile, the Ni2P/VOx electrode exhibited a much smaller Tafel slope of 60.6 mV dec−<sup>1</sup> than that of Ni2P (83.3 mV dec−<sup>1</sup> ), RuO2 (127.9 mV dec−<sup>1</sup> ), NiV-LDH (149.6 mV dec−<sup>1</sup> ), and NF (172.1 mV dec−<sup>1</sup> ) indicating favorable kinetics for OER (**Figure** [3c\)](#page-4-0).[\[41\]](#page-7-0) The OER kinetics was further evaluated using EIS.[\[42\]](#page-7-0) As presented in Figure [3d,](#page-4-0) the fitted charge transfer resistance (Rct) of Ni2P/VOx (22.29 Ω) was relatively lower than that of the comparative catalysts and RuO2 (Table S2), demonstrating its rapid charge-transfer kinetics.[\[43\]](#page-7-0) To further investigate their intrinsic activities, the ECSAs of catalysts were

evaluated using the double-layer capacitance (Cdl),[\[44\]](#page-7-0) which was measured by CV in the non-Faradaic potential region of 1.17 – 1.27 V (versus RHE) with the scan rate ranging from 20 to 100 mV s−<sup>1</sup> (Figure S3). Figure 3e illustrated that Ni2P/VOx possessed the largest Cdl value of 9.85 mF cm−<sup>2</sup> followed by Ni2P (7.17 mF cm−<sup>2</sup> ), NiV-LDH (6.28 mF cm−<sup>2</sup> ), and NF (4.65 mF cm−<sup>2</sup> ). The high Cdl of Ni2P/VOx meant its abundant reaction sites exposed at the surface, which was attributed to the synergistic effect of the heterojunction interfaces between Ni2P and VOx. [\[45,46\]](#page-7-0) The enhanced OER activity of the electrocatalysts possibly benefitted from the pair of redox peaks. As shown in Figure S4, the redox peaks of Ni2P appear at 1.44/1.22 V corresponding to the transition of Ni3<sup>+</sup> ↔ Ni2+[\[47\]](#page-7-0) and Ni2P/VOx catalyst exhibits similar CV curve as that of Ni2P. It is noteworthy that the Ni2P/VOx product shows more strong redox peaks and larger areas compared to Ni2P, confirming its high OER activity. However, the redox peaks of NF are very weak under the same condition, indicating that the contribution of NF for the promotion of OER process can be negligible. Consequently, the Ni sites served as the active sites for Ni2P/VOx electrode.[\[48\]](#page-7-0) Moreover, the turnover frequency (TOF) values were calculated as exhibited Figures S5 and S6. Ni2P/VOx shows the highest TOF value of 0.15 s−<sup>1</sup> at an overpotential of 500 mV, further confirming its remarkable inherent activity.

The long-term stability of electrocatalysts is a critical factor for practical applications. As depicted in Figure 3f, the i–t curve of the Ni2P/VOx electrode showed negligible degradation at a constant current density of 10 mA cm−<sup>2</sup> during 50 h test and the OER polarization curves before and after 1000 cycles nearly remained identical (inset of Figure 3f), revealing its outstanding durability.[\[49\]](#page-7-0) Subsequently, the structural changes of Ni2P/VOx after OER process were characterized. It was found that there was no significant change in the XPS spectra of Ni2P/VOx after

the stability test (Figure [3g,h\)](#page-4-0), while the increase in the ratio of V<sup>4</sup>+/V<sup>3</sup><sup>+</sup> resulted from the surface oxidation of electrocatalyst during OER process.[\[50,51\]](#page-7-0) Meanwhile, the SEM images of Ni2P/VOx after prolonged stability measurement also maintained a similar structure (Figure [3i\)](#page-4-0). These results demonstrated the excellent structural stability of Ni2P/VOx. Based on the above analyses, the outstanding electrocatalytic performance of Ni2P/VOx can be attributed to the following factors: 1) The interconnected porous nanoflowers and nanoparticles structures effectively promoted electrolyte diffusion and gas release. 2) The electron redistribution induced by the heterojunction interface significantly accelerated charge separation and transfer, enhancing the kinetics of the OER. 3) The strong interface coupling improved the mechanical strength of Ni2P/VOx.

# **3.1. Theoretical Calculation**

DFT calculation was performed to deeply understand the enhanced OER catalytic activity of the electrocatalysts. The theoretical models of Ni2P/V2O3, Ni2P, and V2O3 were constructed based on the XRD patterns and TEM results (Figures 4a and S7).

<span id="page-6-0"></span>As shown in Figure [4b,](#page-5-0) the Ni2P/V2O3 heterostructure exhibits a significantly increased density of states (DOS) value in comparison with Ni2P and V2O3 at the Fermi level, indicating the its excellent electronic properties, which is favorable to promote charge transfer kinetics of Ni2P/VOx in the OER process.[\[52,53\]](#page-7-0) The differential charge density diagram reveals that the coupling of Ni2P and V2O3 leads to the charge-localized redistribution at the interface (Figure [4c,d\)](#page-5-0) in which the yellow and blue zones represent the charge accumulation and dispersion, respectively. It can be found that the electrons accumulate at the V2O3 side accompanied by the electron depletion from Ni2P, matching well with the XPS results, which effectively boost the catalytic performances of Ni2P/VOx material. Moreover, the thermodynamic free energies for OER intermediates (OH\*, O\*, and OOH\*) were calculated to further investigate the rate-determining step.[\[54\]](#page-7-0) Figure [4e](#page-5-0) indicates that the rate-determining step (RDS) for all materials is the second electrochemical reaction step from OH\* to O\*. Notably, at the bias potential (U) of 0 V, the energy barrier of \*O formation in Ni2P/V2O3 heterostructure (1.641 eV) is smaller than that of Ni2P (1.987 eV) and V2O3 (2.210 eV). Moreover, the RDS energy barriers of Ni2P/V2O3, Ni2P, and V2O3 change to 0.596, 0.876, and 1.411 eV, respectively, when the bias potential raises to 1.23 V. The significant decrease in RDS energy barrier of Ni2P/V2O3 suggests that the optimized electronic configuration of heterogeneous interfaces effectively enhances the OER kinetics[\[55\]](#page-7-0) leading to excellent catalytic performance. Furthermore, the Ni sites served as the reactive sites in Ni2P/V2O3 catalyst for decomposition of water, which is consistent with the experimental results (Figure S4). As a result, four-step OER process with the detailed adsorbed intermediates at the most active site are predicted in Figures [4f](#page-5-0) and S8–S10.

# **4. Conclusion**

In summary, the Ni2P/VOx composite electrode was prepared using NiV-LDH precursor via a straightforward low-temperature phosphorization. Benefitting from the reversible redox activity and rich hierarchical interconnected channels for the mass and electron transfer, the resulting Ni2P/VOx catalyst displays rapid charge-transfer kinetics. Both experimental and theoretical analyses reveal that the strong interfacial interactions between Ni2P and VOx contribute to multiple active surface sites and fast charge transfer and regulate the electronic structure of heterostructures for optimal energy barrier of intermediates. As a result, Ni2P/VOx achieved the current densities of 10 mA cm−<sup>2</sup> and 50 mA cm−<sup>2</sup> at low overpotentials of 210 mV and 290 mV, respectively, along with a long-term stability over 50 h at 10 mA cm−<sup>2</sup> . This work paves the way to construct the vanadium oxides-based heterostructures for sustainable hydrogen production through water splitting.

# Structural and electronic modulation of conductive MOFs for efficient oxygen evolution reaction electrocatalysis†

Jiawen Li, Peng Liu, Jianxin Mao, Jianyue Yan and Wenbo Song \*\*

Conductive metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have been developed as a superior platform for heterogeneous catalysis. Particularly, the tunable composition and structure of conductive MOFs provide an opportunity to probe the structure-activity relationship toward electrocatalysis. Herein, we exemplify an alternative strategy to modulate the electronic structure in conductive MOFs for efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER). By replacing an appropriate number of Ni-O<sub>4</sub> sites with Fe-O<sub>4</sub> sites in NiPc-Ni, the optimal bimetallic conductive MOF has a low overpotential of 300 mV at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> and an ultra-high TOF value of 1.943 s<sup>-1</sup> at  $\eta = 300$  mV. DFT calculations reveal that the electronic interaction between Ni-O<sub>4</sub> and Fe-O<sub>4</sub> notably enhances the intrinsic activity of bimetallic conductive MOFs. This work highlights the importance of modulating the electronic structure of conductive MOFs with great promise for water-splitting and other promising applications.

#### Introduction

As one of the vital processes in water splitting<sup>1,2</sup> and metal–air batteries,<sup>3–5</sup> the oxygen evolution reaction (OER)<sup>6–10</sup> is fast becoming critical in the utilization of clean and sustainable energy.<sup>11</sup> However, the wide utilization of the technology is subjected to the sluggish kinetics of the multistep electron transfer process  $(2H_2O(1) \rightarrow 4e^- + 4H^+(aq) + O_2(g))$ . Some noblemetal-based catalysts (RuO<sub>2</sub>, IrO<sub>2</sub>, *etc.*) exhibit the highest OER activity, but their universal application is obstructed by their high cost and scarcity.<sup>12</sup> Alternatively, inorganic nano-catalysts such as transition metal-based materials have been developed.<sup>13</sup> As a consequence of the unexposed metal in the bulk phase, only the metal sites on the surface of these inorganics are active for the OER.<sup>14</sup> Although enhancing the utilization of metal sites in electrocatalysts is vital to efficient OER,<sup>15</sup> particular challenges still exist so far.

As a series of crystalline coordination frameworks constructed from metal ions and organic linkers with permanent porosity, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) emerge as promising electrocatalysts with sufficiently dispersed and completely utilized metal sites. <sup>16,17</sup> In light of their unparalleled chemical composition, MOFs have been exploited as efficient catalysts for various chemical reactions. <sup>18-20</sup> However, the electrocatalytic application of MOFs is restricted by their inadequate electronic conductivity. <sup>21</sup> Recently, two-dimensional (2D) conductive

MOFs with superior conductivity have attracted much attention in the field of electrocatalysis.22 In such MOFs, the charge transport is enhanced by the improved conjugation in a high  $\pi$ electron delocalization system.23 Benefitting from their high conductivity and definite chemical structure, conductive MOFs can act as a superior platform to unveil the intrinsic active sites for electrocatalysis.24 To date, few conductive MOFs with specific active sites for advanced electrocatalysis have been explored. For example, Ni<sub>3</sub>(Ni<sub>3</sub>·HAHATN)<sub>2</sub> with a Ni-N<sub>2</sub> site exhibits remarkable activity toward the hydrogen evolution reaction.25 The Co-O4 site in Co3HTTP2 shows good OER activity,26 while the Co-N4 site in Co3HITP2 manifests high selectivity for the oxygen reduction reaction.27 Particularly, the adjustable chemical composition of conductive MOFs provides the opportunity to modulate the electronic structure, which may lead to diverse catalytic performance. Therefore, the study of the structure-activity relationship is of great importance for novel electrocatalyst exploitation. In previous work, we reported a unique method to modify the electronic structure in 2D conductive MOFs by using phthalocyanine with extra metal sites as building blocks.28 The resulting dual-metal site conductive MOFs exhibit enhanced OER activity through the electronic interaction between Ni-O4 and Ni-N4. Based on all these research foundations, one may suppose that the electronic interaction can be tuned by modifying the structure of conductive MOFs, which offers controllability for electrocatalytic activity. Therefore, exploiting an effective strategy to modulate the electronic structure of conductive MOFs will shed new light on the investigation of the structure-activity relationship. So far, only a few studies on the activity origin of conductive MOFs have emerged very recently. Unraveling the

structure-activity relationship is urgently required for advanced electrocatalysis.

In this work, we exemplify an alternative approach to modulate the electronic structure in conductive MOFs for efficient OER. By replacing some Ni-O<sub>4</sub> sites in NiPc-Ni with Fe-O<sub>4</sub> sites, a series of bimetallic conductive MOFs (denoted as NiPc- $NiFe_x$ ) are successfully achieved. Electrochemical tests confirm the remarkable activity of NiPc-NiFe<sub>0.09</sub> for the OER, featuring a small overpotential of 300 mV (at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>) with a low Tafel slope of 55 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>. Particularly, NiPc-NiFe<sub>0.09</sub> has an ultrahigh TOF value (1.943 s<sup>-1</sup> at  $\eta = 300$  mV), higher than those of most MOF-based OER catalysts. DFT calculations reveal that the electronic interaction between Ni-O<sub>4</sub> and Fe-O<sub>4</sub> significantly enhances the intrinsic activity of conductive MOFs. This study demonstrates that electronic modulation can be a potent approach to ascertain the structure-activity relationship of bimetallic conductive MOFs, showing great promise for watersplitting and other promising applications.

#### Results and discussion

#### Synthesis and characterization

Firstly, the (2,3,9,10,16,17,23,24-octamethoxyphthalocyaninato) nickel (NiPc) building block was synthesized in accordance with reported studies. <sup>29,30</sup> Typically, NiPc-NiFe<sub>x</sub> (x = 0.05, 0.09, 0.20) conductive MOFs were obtained via a solvothermal method by combining NiPc building blocks with different molar ratios of nickel acetate and ferrous acetate (20%, 9%, 5%) via metaloxygen (M-O<sub>4</sub>) linkages (Fig. 1). The successful preparation of these MOFs was ascertained by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) tests (Fig. S2†). Compared to the simulated pattern, several diffraction peaks at around 5.5°, 10.5° and 26.3° in bimetallic MOFs can be attributed to (100), (200), and (001) crystal faces, indicating that NiPc-NiFex MOFs are successfully obtained. However, compared with NiPc-Ni (Fig. S1†), the diffraction peak intensity of these MOFs is quite low, which illustrates the reduced crystallinity of Fe-doped conductive MOFs.

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were exploited in order to examine the crystalline morphology of NiPc-NiFe<sub>x</sub> conductive MOFs. As shown in Fig. 2a and b, the SEM images reveal regular cubes of 100-500 nm with nanoscopic crystallites in NiPc-NiFe<sub>0.05</sub> and NiPc-NiFe<sub>0.09</sub>, respectively. Meanwhile, in Fig. 2c, irregular

crystallites of 100 nm are observed in NiPc-NiFe<sub>0.20</sub>. The above results indicate that the crystallinity of MOFs becomes lower once a larger amount of Fe is doped. The TEM images also show regular cubes with nanoscopic crystallites in NiPc-NiFe<sub>0.05</sub> and NiPc-NiFe<sub>0.09</sub> (Fig. 2d and e), and irregular crystallite stacking in NiPc-NiFe<sub>0.20</sub> (Fig. 2f), which also proves the decrease of crystallinity upon increasing the amount of Fe doping. The mapping analysis of NiPc-NiFe<sub>0.09</sub> shows a homogeneous presence of all these elements (Fig. 2g), indicating that Fe sites are evenly dispersed in the framework.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was adopted to survey the surface chemical state and element components of NiPc-NiFe<sub>x</sub>. The results in Fig. S5a-S7a† indicate the presence of Fe, Ni, C, N, and O elements. There are two peaks (855.8 and 873.0 eV) assignable to Ni  $2p_{3/2}$  and Ni  $2p_{1/2}$  in the Ni 2p spectra (Fig. 3a), revealing the presence of Ni(II).31 As shown in Fig. 3b, compared with NiPc-Ni, the Ni 2p3/2 peaks of NiPc-NiFex slightly shift to higher energy, which is due to the introduction of Fe-O<sub>4</sub> sites. This change is considered to be due to the transfer of some Ni-O<sub>4</sub> electrons to the Fe-O<sub>4</sub> sites through the highly conjugated structure,32 resulting in a modification in the

electronic structure of Ni–O $_4$  sites in the NiPc–NiFe MOFs. The Fe 2p spectra show the peaks of Fe 2p $_{3/2}$  and Fe 2p $_{1/2}$  (Fig. S9†). The subpeaks of Fe 2p $_{3/2}$  at 710.0 and 712.4 eV suggest the presence of Fe(II) and Fe(III). The corresponding satellite peaks appear at higher energy in 2p orbitals, which proves that Ni or Fe atoms and O atoms form antibonding orbitals. The ratio of integral area belonging to C–O (531.4 eV) and C=O (532.8 eV) in O 1s spectra is approximative, illustrating that the semiquinone forms ligands present in NiPc–NiFe $_x$  MOFs (Fig. S5d–S7d†). The C 1s spectra show subpeaks that can be assigned to C=N (285.4 eV), C=C (284.6 eV), C–O (286.2 eV), and C=O (288.0 eV) (Fig. S5b–S7b†). Furthermore, the peak of N 1s can be differentiated into two subpeaks, C–N (399.0 eV) and Ni–N (400.5 eV), assignable to N atoms of phthalocyanine (Fig. S5c–S7c†).

To gain better insights into active sites, NiPc-Fe was synthesized by the same method as a control. No diffraction peaks are observed in the PXRD pattern of NiPc-Fe, indicating that the prepared material is a coordination polymer rather than a MOF. The SEM images show the morphology of irregular particles with a smooth surface (Fig. S3a and b†). In the TEM images, one can observe that the NiPc-Fe particles are stacked by nanosheets (Fig. S4g and h†). The XPS analysis of NiPc-Fe indicates the presence of Ni, Fe, C, N, and O (Fig. S8a†). As shown in Fig. S6e,† Ni  $2p_{3/2}$  and Ni  $2p_{1/2}$  can be assigned to the Ni(II) in NiPc building blocks. In addition, no satellite peak appears at the higher energy of Ni 2p orbitals, indicating that there is no antibonding orbital between Ni and O atoms. In the Fe 2p high-resolution spectrum, two subpeaks observed at 710.0 and 712.2 eV indicate the presence of Fe(II) and Fe(III) (Fig. S8f†). The satellite peaks at the higher energy of Fe 2p orbitals reveal the formation of a coordination bond between Fe and O atoms. Moreover, the O 1s spectrum shows that the ratio of integral area belonging to C-O and C=O is approximative (Fig. S8d†), which manifests the semiquinone state of the building blocks.

#### **OER performance**

The electrocatalytic ability of bimetallic conductive MOFs for the OER was evaluated using a three-electrode system with oxygen-saturated 1.0 M KOH aqueous solution at 298 K. It should be noted that the OER data of NiPc-Ni in our previous work were used for comparison. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was applied to obtain polarization curves in the range of 1.07–1.87 V. In electrocatalysis, the overpotential  $(\eta)$  of the electrocatalytic reaction shown by the polarization curves manifests the efficiency of the catalysts. To compare the electrocatalytic abilities with other materials, the overpotential to attain 10 mA  ${\rm cm}^{-2}$  is usually regarded as a criterion. In Fig. 4a, the  $\eta$  values (at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>) of NiPc-Fe and NiPc-Ni are 368 mV and 427 mV, which are much higher than that of NiPc-NiFe<sub>x</sub>. Among the NiPc-NiFe<sub>x</sub> MOFs, NiPc-NiFe<sub>0.09</sub> shows the lowest overpotential of 300 mV (Fig. S7†), smaller than those of NiPc- $NiFe_{0.05}$  (333 mV) and  $NiPc-NiFe_{0.20}$  (337 mV). The change of overpotential in NiPc-NiFex suggests that the amount of Fe affects the activity of the materials. To acquire a high current density (100 mA cm $^{-2}$ ), NiPc–NiFe $_{0.09}$  also exhibits the smallest overpotential of 384 mV, compared to those of NiPc-NiFe<sub>0.05</sub>

(410 mV), NiPc-NiFe<sub>0.20</sub> (418 mV), and NiPc-Fe (474 mV). The OER process kinetics of the NiPc-NiFe<sub>x</sub> MOFs were carefully inspected by Tafel slope estimation (Fig. 4b). NiPc-NiFe<sub>0.09</sub> displays the lowest Tafel slope of 55 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>, in contrast to those of NiPc-NiFe<sub>0.20</sub> (56 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>), NiPc-NiFe<sub>0.05</sub> (58 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>), NiPc-Fe (61 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>), and NiPc-Ni (81 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>). The above results demonstrate that NiPc-NiFe<sub>0.09</sub> has the fastest OER kinetics among these Fe-doped conductive MOFs.

Interestingly, an obvious shift in the oxidation peak of Ni<sup>2+</sup> to Ni<sup>3+</sup> in these conductive MOFs is observed (Fig. S10†). In the absence of Fe, the oxidation peak of NiPc–Ni locates at 1.426 V. Upon incorporation of Fe into the MOF, the oxidation peak of NiPc–NiFe<sub>0.05</sub> is pushed toward a more positive potential (1.491 V), while the OER overpotential at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> is significantly reduced. With further increasing the Fe doping amount, the oxidation peak of NiPc–NiFe<sub>0.09</sub> positively shifts to about 1.521 V, almost merging into the OER current. Furthermore, no oxidation peak is found in the polarization curve of NiPc–NiFe<sub>0.20</sub>, due to a complete overlap between the oxidation peak of Ni<sup>2+</sup> to Ni<sup>3+</sup> and the OER current. The result indicates that the oxidation peak is suppressed by the presence of Fe.<sup>35</sup>

To further investigate the factors that influence the OER activity of Fe-doped conductive MOFs, the electrochemical surface area (ECSA) of each MOF is assessed according to double-layer capacitance ( $C_{\rm dl}$ ), which is usually estimated from a cyclic voltammetry (CV) test (Fig. S9†). Among these Fe-doped MOFs, NiPc-NiFe<sub>0.09</sub> exhibits the largest  $C_{\rm dl}$  value of 1.60 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>, in accordance with the highest electrocatalytic performance for NiPc-NiFe<sub>0.09</sub> MOF (Fig. S11†). To obtain better insights into electrocatalytic kinetics during the OER process, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) assessments were conducted at 1.57 V from 100 kHz to 0.5 Hz in 1 M KOH. Charge transfer resistances ( $R_{\rm ct}$ ) were calculated according to the curve-fitting Nyquist plots under the appropriate module (Fig. 4c). NiPc-NiFe<sub>0.09</sub> is found to have the smallest  $R_{\rm ct}$  value (0.33  $\Omega$  cm<sup>2</sup>), which is smaller than those of NiPc-NiFe<sub>0.05</sub> (1.56

 $\Omega$  cm<sup>2</sup>), NiPc-NiFe<sub>0.20</sub> (2.32  $\Omega$  cm<sup>2</sup>), NiPc-Fe (12.26  $\Omega$  cm<sup>2</sup>), and NiPc-Ni (19.25  $\Omega$  cm<sup>2</sup>). A comparison of other parameters is included in Table S2,† which shows the improved kinetics of NiPc-NiFe<sub>0.09</sub> compared to other MOFs. The above electrochemical results demonstrate the high activity of NiPc-NiFe<sub>0.09</sub>, deriving from the fast charge transfer kinetics and sufficiently intrinsic active sites retained in the regular and porous structures. The electrochemical durability of NiPc-NiFe<sub>0.09</sub> was tested by performing 1000 CV cycles at 50 mV s<sup>-1</sup> (Fig. 4d). One can be seen that the OER polarization curve displays a slight positive shift (33 mV shift at 50 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>) after 1000 cycles, indicating good stability in the electrochemical OER under alkaline conditions. The morphology of the catalyst on the electrode surface after the OER process was inspected by SEM (Fig. S15c and d†). Compared to the SEM images of NiPc-NiFe<sub>0.09</sub> before the OER, the ratio of the cube decreases while the number of small crystallites increases.

Comparison of high-resolution XPS spectra before and after the electrocatalysis process provides a way to further reveals the stability of the conductive MOF catalysts. Due to the small amount of catalysts on the glassy carbon electrode surface, carbon cloth (CC) is used as a substrate to carry the MOF catalysts for OER and XPS tests. After a chronoamperometry process for 15 000 s (Fig. S13†), the current of NiPc-NiFe<sub>0.09</sub>@CC scarcely decreases. As shown in Fig. S14,† the peaks in the Ni 2p XPS spectra of NiPc-NiFe<sub>0.09</sub>@CC do not change obviously after the chronoamperometry test, which further demonstrates the good stability of the MOF composition during the OER process. After the OER process, the MOF catalyst was isolated from carbon cloth by ultrasonication and centrifugation for a PXRD test. The intensity of the characteristic peaks slightly reduces, suggesting a good electrochemical stability of NiPc-NiFe<sub>0.09</sub>.

The turnover frequency (TOF) is a significant standard to assess the intrinsic activity of catalysts, which can also exclude the influence of other factors (ECSA, geometric area, etc.). The TOF value of NiPc-NiFe<sub>0.09</sub> is 1.943 s<sup>-1</sup> at  $\eta = 300$  mV, which is the highest compared with those of NiPc-NiFe<sub>0.05</sub> (1.181 s<sup>-1</sup>) and NiPc-NiFe<sub>0.20</sub> (1.005 s<sup>-1</sup>). This result implies that the metal sites (mainly Ni sites) in NiPc-NiFe<sub>0.09</sub> have higher intrinsic activity than those of other Fe-doped conductive MOFs. Under an overpotential of 350 mV, the TOF value of NiPc-NiFe<sub>0.09</sub> even reaches 11.943 s<sup>-1</sup>, which is remarkable among the state-of-theart OER electrocatalysts. Importantly, NiPc-NiFe<sub>0.05</sub> with a smaller amount of Fe doping exhibits a higher TOF value than that of NiPc-NiFe<sub>0.20</sub>, which indicates that even a small amount of Fe doping could significantly affect the intrinsic activity of

As shown in Table S1,† the OER performances of several MOF-based electrocatalysts are summarized for comparison. The optimal NiPc-NiFe<sub>0.09</sub> conductive MOF manifests a small overpotential of 300 mV at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> and a low Tafel slope of 55 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>, which is superior to that of most MOFs.<sup>36-44</sup> More importantly, the TOF value of NiPc-NiFe<sub>0.09</sub> (1.193 s<sup>-1</sup> at 300 mV overpotential) is significantly large among all the MOFs in the table, indicating the high intrinsic activity of NiPc-NiFe<sub>0.09</sub>. Moreover, the OER activity and stability of the commercial RuO2 catalyst are also studied for comparison. As shown in Fig. S16,† the RuO2 catalyst shows an overpotential of 317 mV a 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. After 1000 CV cycles, the overpotential positively shifts to 395 mV. Compared with the RuO2 catalyst, NiPc-NiFe<sub>0.09</sub> displays improved OER electrocatalytic performance.

#### **DFT** calculations

The structure-activity relationship of the Fe-doped conductive MOFs was revealed by DFT calculations. Firstly, four MOF slab models were built and named NiPc-Ni Slab, NiPc-NiFe<sub>0.13</sub> Slab, NiPc-NiFe<sub>0.50</sub> Slab, and NiPc-Fe Slab (Fig. S17†). The ratio of Fe-O<sub>4</sub> and Ni-O<sub>4</sub> sites in the NiPc-NiFe<sub>0.13</sub> Slab is 1:7, while the ratio is 1:1 in the NiPc-NiFe<sub>0.50</sub> Slab. To analyze the electronic structure, the density of states (DOS) of these slabs was calculated and plotted in Fig. 5a. In transition-metal based electrocatalysts, the d-orbitals of the transition metal can couple with those of the adsorbate, leading to the formation of bonding and antibonding states.45 As a fundamental understanding, the bonding strength between a metal and an adsorbate is determined by the d-band center  $(\varepsilon_d)$ , 46 which further affects the catalytic ability of transition-metal-based electrocatalysts. 47,48 As shown in Fig. 5a, the  $\varepsilon_{\rm d}$  of the NiPc- $NiFe_{0.13}$  Slab was calculated to be -2.33 eV, which is the closest to the Fermi level  $(E_{\rm F})$  compared with that of NiPc-Ni (-2.50eV), NiPc-NiFe<sub>0.50</sub> (-2.68 eV), and NiPc-Fe (-2.82 eV). This result indicates the largest bonding force between metal active sites and oxygen intermediates as well as the highest OER activity in the NiPc-NiFe<sub>0.13</sub> Slab. Compared to the NiPc-Ni Slab, the  $\varepsilon_d$  of the NiPc-NiFe<sub>0.50</sub> Slab is far from the Fermi level, probably due to the energy reduction of the filling electrons in the presence of a large quantity of Fe atoms.

As a fundamental understanding, the synergistic effect in bimetallic MOFs is the origin of enhanced heterogeneous catalytic activity.49 Compared with the monometallic MOF catalysts, the synergistic effect in bimetallic MOFs between two metal sites could reduce the reaction energy barrier in

electrocatalysis, leading to improved selectivity and activity. $^{50,51}$  The improved activity by Fe doping suggests that the synergistic effect could also exist in NiPc-NiFe $_x$  MOFs, which possibly induces the electronic structure change of Ni-O $_4$  and Fe-O $_4$  sites

To further investigate the electronic interaction between Ni-O<sub>4</sub> and Fe-O<sub>4</sub>, the d-orbital partial density of states (PDOS) of Ni-O<sub>4</sub> sites in these slabs was plotted (Fig. 5b). Similarly, the  $\varepsilon_d$ of Ni-O<sub>4</sub> in the NiPc-NiFe<sub>0.13</sub> Slab (-2.35 eV) is the closest to the  $E_{\rm F}$ , while the  $\varepsilon_{\rm d}$  of Ni-O<sub>4</sub> in the NiPc-NiFe<sub>0.50</sub> Slab (-2.37 eV) and NiPc-Ni Slab (-2.43 eV) is more negative. Therefore, the  ${
m Ni-O_4}$  sites in the  ${
m NiPc-NiFe_{0.13}}$  Slab exhibit significantly high intrinsic activity. Moreover, the d-orbital PDOS of Fe-O<sub>4</sub> sites in these slabs was also plotted in Fig. 5c. The  $\varepsilon_d$  of Fe-O<sub>4</sub> in the NiPc-NiFe<sub>0.13</sub> Slab (-1.82 eV) is significantly close to the  $E_{\rm F}$ compared to that in the NiPc-NiFe<sub>0.50</sub> Slab (-3.20 eV) and NiPc-Fe Slab (-3.17 eV), indicating high intrinsic activity of the Fe-O<sub>4</sub> sites in the NiPc–NiFe $_{0.13}$  Slab. The  $\varepsilon_{d}$  of Ni–O $_{4}$  and Fe–O $_{4}$  sites in these slabs in relation to the Fe-O4 content was plotted in Fig. 5d. Compared with the others, the  $\varepsilon_d$  of Ni–O<sub>4</sub> and Fe–O<sub>4</sub> in the NiPc-NiFe<sub>0.13</sub> Slab is closest to the  $E_{\rm F}$ , indicating the highest intrinsic activity of both Ni-O<sub>4</sub> and Fe-O<sub>4</sub> in the NiPc-NiFe<sub>0.13</sub> Slab. As the number of Fe-O<sub>4</sub> sites increases, the  $\varepsilon_d$  of Ni-O<sub>4</sub> and Fe-O<sub>4</sub> gradually moves away from  $E_{\rm F}$ . The above theoretical calculation results reveal that electronic interaction exists between Ni-O<sub>4</sub> and Fe-O<sub>4</sub> sites in bimetallic conductive MOFs, which further influences the intrinsic activity of the material. Moreover, a specific amount of Fe doping could lead to the highest overall electrocatalytic activity among these MOF slabs, consistent with the experimental results.

#### Conclusions

In summary, an alternative strategy is confirmed to modulate the electronic structure in conductive MOFs for efficient OER. By replacing a specific number of Ni-O<sub>4</sub> sites in NiPc-Ni with Fe-O<sub>4</sub> sites, a series of bimetallic conductive MOFs with diverse electrocatalytic activity are achieved. The bimetallic MOF with an appropriate number of Fe atoms exhibits high activity, higher than that of other bimetallic MOFs with a lower or higher amount of Fe-doping. The optimal NiPc-NiFe<sub>0.09</sub> manifests a low overpotential (300 mV at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>) with an ultra-high TOF value (1.943 s<sup>-1</sup> at  $\eta = 300$  mV). Moreover, DFT calculations reveal that the electronic interaction between Ni-O4 and Fe-O<sub>4</sub> sites enhances their intrinsic catalytic activity in conductive MOFs, which is consistent with the result from TOF analysis. This study not only provides guidelines for the structural and electronic modulation of conductive MOFs toward the OER, but also highlights the importance of investigating the structure-activity relationship, which may shed light on further exploration of versatile applications.

## **Experimental section**

Nickel( $\pi$ ) acetate tetrahydrate and potassium hydroxide (KOH) were bought from Aladdin. Anhydrous ferrous acetate, acetone,

ethanol, and *N,N*-dimethylformamide (DMF) were bought from Energy Chemical. Ammonium hydroxide solution was acquired from Macklin.

The three-electrode system comprises a saturated calomel reference electrode, a glassy carbon (diameter  $=3\,$  mm) working electrode, and a graphite rod counter electrode. Typically, a mixture of 2 mg catalyst, 2 mg acetylene black, 0.5 mL DMF, and 0.5 mL H $_2$ O was ultrasonicated for 1 h, then the catalyst ink was prepared. A glassy carbon electrode was fully polished and 10  $\mu$ L ink was cautiously dropped and then dried at 298 K. At last, 5  $\mu$ L Nafion (0.5 wt%) was carefully dropped onto the working electrode surface to form a protective membrane. LSV measurements were conducted with 95% *iR*-correction at 10 mV s $^{-1}$ . ECSA analysis was achieved by CV tests at a series of selected scan rates from 20 to 200 mV s $^{-1}$ .

#### Theoretical computations

Quantum ESPRESSO software packages were used for all of the DFT calculations.<sup>52,53</sup> All the MOF slabs used for the calculations were built under BURAI, a GUI for Quantum ESPRESSO. A vacuum slab of 15 angstroms was applied between the (001)

facets to reduce the unwanted interactions. An electronic convergence threshold of  $1 \times 10^{-6}$  eV was used for the SCF cycles and the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) algorithm was used for ionic dynamics optimization. The PBE54 functional under the GGA with PAW55 pseudopotentials from Pslibrary 1.0.0 (ref. 56) was utilized in the PW module for SCF calculations. A Gaussian smearing with 0.01 Ry was set to process Fermi-surface effects. A kinetic energy cutoff for wavefunctions of 50 Ry and kinetic energy cutoff for charge density and potential of 500 Ry were applied. The Brillouin-zones were set at the gamma point for SCF calculations while a  $4 \times 4 \times 1$  kpoint mesh was used for NSCF calculations. DOS and PDOS calculations were executed using DOS and PROJWFC modules, respectively. Additionally, the Fermi level was set as 0 eV before the DOS and PDOS were plotted.

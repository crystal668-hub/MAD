We investigated the electrocatalytic properties of  $Ir/\beta\text{-MnO}_2$ , with 4.2–5.6 atomic % (at%) iridium. The  $Ir/\beta\text{-MnO}_2$  was synthesized by heating  $Ir/R\text{-MnO}_2$ —formed via a surfactant-assisted (SA) method using  $KMnO_4$ ,  $IrCl_3.H_2O$ , and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)—to  $400\,^{\circ}\text{C}$ . The  $Ir/\beta\text{-MnO}_2$  (SA) was nanosized based on scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM and TEM). Using linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), 5.6 at%  $Ir/\beta\text{-MnO}_2$  (SA) exhibited an overpotential  $(\eta)$  of  $327\pm5$  mV for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), at 10 mA cm $^{-2}$  in 0.5 M

H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> electrolyte. At 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> the Ir/β-MnO<sub>2</sub> (SA) catalyzed the OER for 72 h at an  $\eta$  of 534 mV. During this time there was a 12% loss in Mn and 8% loss in Ir from the structure. An IrO<sub>2</sub> catalyst exhibited an initial  $\eta$  of 420  $\pm$ 7 for the OER, but after 20 h of operation at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> there was a steep rise in potential (>550 mV) and 12% loss in Ir. The enhanced activity and stability of Ir/β-MnO<sub>2</sub> (SA) is attributed to the incorporation of Ir into the MnO<sub>2</sub> lattice during synthesis and the formation of nano-sized particles using the SA method.

# Introduction

Due to the high energy density of hydrogen and the environmentally friendly by-products formed during the molecule's combustion, it has become a target as a viable replacement for fossil fuels.<sup>[1]</sup> One of the most effective ways to produce hydrogen for energy carrier and storage applications is via the electrochemical splitting of water into oxygen and hydrogen. This strategy is potentially a sustainable method since it could utilize clean electricity harnessed from solar or wind energy to produce electrical energy that could then be used to drive water splitting using an effective electrocatalyst.[2] The water splitting reaction involves two half-reactions, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at the cathode. [2] Carrying out both half-reactions in an acidic medium allows the use of a proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer (PEMWE).[1] The PEM, an acidic solid-polymer electrolyte membrane that divides the cathode and anode in an electrolyzer, ensures strong proton conductivity and low gas crossover to provide low ohmic loss, high current density and voltage efficiency. [3] However, developing an electrocatalyst that shows excellent activity and stability under oxidizing potentials in an acidic medium is still a challenge and currently restricts the application of PEMWEs.[4]

Due to the ease at which many metal oxides, which are composed of earth-abundant elements, dissolve at low pH limits their use as potential OER electrocatalysts. [5] In contrast, precious metals that include Ir and Ru, along with their oxides

IrO<sub>2</sub> and RuO<sub>2</sub>, respectively, demonstrate satisfactory performance, in terms of activity and stability, as water-splitting catalysts across a wide pH range. [6] Even though IrO2 is less active than RuO2, it exhibits superior stability for acidic OER, making IrO2 or Ir-based materials a viable choice for the corrosive reaction medium.<sup>[7-9]</sup> Nevertheless, the utilization of Irbased catalysts for large-scale water splitting faces two primary challenges: their high cost due to limited earth-abundance and their limited stability in low pH conditions. [4,10] Toward this end, a wide range of catalyst designs have been carried out to control the structure, activity, and stability of Ir-based catalysts, such as introducing crystal lattice distortion/strain.[11] calcination of IrO<sub>2</sub> to improve the short-range ordering,<sup>[10]</sup> and optimizations of Ir-O-metal bonding by doping. [12] Doping of a transition metal (TM) to produce Ir-O-TM bonds has been suggested to lead to an optimized covalency of the Ir-O bond and a modified electronic structure of the Ir 5 d orbital.[13] Density functional theory (DFT) computation has shown that the modified electronic structure of the Ir 5 d orbital affects the adsorption energies of OER intermediates, resulting in a reduced activation barrier for the OER and enhanced stability of the catalyst.[12,13]

Regarding the modification of the Ir–O bonding by transition metal doping, prior research has shown the  $\beta\text{-MnO}_2$  phase with 3.3 at% Ir exhibited an overpotential at 10 mA cm $_{\rm geo}^{-2}$  ( $\eta$ ) of 337  $\pm$  9 mV, but a limited stability of 6 h in 0.5 M  $\rm H_2SO_4^{,[14]}$  The initial overpotential (lower than IrO $_2$ ) was likely due to the formation of Ir–O–Mn bonding, essential for the thermodynamic stability of the structure and favorable for the OER activity. The limited stability was likely due to the inability to completely (or uniformly) incorporate Ir into the MnO $_2$  lattice.

This contribution builds on this prior research with the goal of better incorporating Ir into the  $\beta$ -MnO<sub>2</sub> phase and achieve improved stability of the catalyst during low pH OER. Toward

this end, we present a modified surfactant-assisted (SA) synthetic method,[15] which involves the gradual hydrolysis of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), acting as a both reducing and structure inducing agent to incorporate Ir while growing nanoflakes of ramsdellite (R-MnO2). The 5.6 at% Ir/R-MnO2 (SA) resulted in a nano-sized flake-like morphology, with a low h for acidic OER and constant catalytic stability for 24 h. We show, however, that annealing the low-loaded Ir/R-MnO2 (SA) catalyst induces a phase transition to form Ir doped β-MnO2 with a similar morphology. The 5.6 at% Ir/β-MnO2 (SA) exhibited an OER h of 327�5 mV, but importantly the electrocatalyst exhibited a much improved structural stability of 72 h in 0.5 M H2SO4 relative to prior synthetic efforts without SDS. This material outperformed Ir/R-MnO2 (SA), hydrothermally (HT) synthesized Ir/β-MnO2 (HT) with micron-sized particles, and commercial catalysts like IrO2 and IrO2 (rutile) on a per Ir-mass basis.

# **Results and Discussion**

#### **Structural Characterization**

## *X-Ray Diffraction (XRD)*

Figure 1a exhibits XRD data for 5.6 at% Ir/R-MnO2 (SA), 5.6 at% Ir/β-MnO2 (SA) and β-MnO2 that were synthesized in our laboratory (see Table S1 for elemental composition). We also show reference XRD for R-MnO2 and β-MnO2. Inspection of these data shows that 5.6 at% Ir/R-MnO2 (SA) compares well with published XRD data for R-MnO2 (ramsdellite, with 1×2 tunnel structure).[16] Based on the XRD data, when 5.6 at% Ir/R-MnO2 (SA) was annealed to 400°C, R-MnO2 underwent a phase transformation to β-MnO2, the rutile phase of MnO2 also known as pyrolusite (with 1×1 tunnel structure). This contention is supported by the similarity of the XRD reflections associated with the annealed Ir/R-MnO2 (SA) with those associated with laboratory-synthesized β-MnO2 (and XRD from the literature[17]). Figure 1b highlights the (101) Bragg reflections of Ir/β-MnO2 (SA) and β-MnO2. Analysis of these data shows a broadening of this reflection and an increase of the (101) lattice spacing of Ir/ β-MnO2 (SA) by ~0.02 Å, compared to pristine β-MnO2. This shift is likely due to a structural change occurring by doping Ir into the β-MnO2 lattice, inferred from prior work from our group.[14] A similar shift was observed for Ir/R-MnO2 (SA).

Prior research showed that the addition of Ni salts to KMnO4 and SDS at acidic conditions led to the incorporation of Ni into the MnO2 nanosheet that makes up the layered δ-MnO2 phase.[18] In contrast, under similar conditions (with respect to KMnO4, SDS, and pH) the presence of Ir led to the formation of R-MnO2 at room temperature. This preference for the more close-packed 3D coordination of the R-MnO2 structure at room temperature and rutile β-MnO2 structure upon heating in the presence of Ir may be due to the delocalization of the 5 d electrons associated with this atom (relative to the localized 3 d electrons of Ni).[19] DFT computation has also shown in prior research that tetravalent Ir incorporated into β-MnO2 is a more

thermodynamically stable material than in Ir/δ-MnO2. [14] It is noted that the structural transformation of Ir/R-MnO2 (SA) to Ir/ β-MnO2 (SA) at 400� C occurs for 4.2 at% and 4.5 at% Ir materials (Figure S1). We also investigated a 3.6 at% Ir/β-MnO2 (HT) material that was synthesized using a one-step hydrothermal (HT) method. The objective in synthesizing this material was to provide a comparison to emphasize the properties associated with Ir/β-MnO2 (SA). Based on XRD (Figure S2), the structure of Ir/β-MnO2 (HT) is similar to Ir/β-MnO2 (SA) suggesting that both methods result in Ir being incorporated into the β-MnO2 lattice.

## *Electron Microscopy*

Figure 2a and b and Figure S3 show transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images for 5.6 at% Ir/β-MnO2 (SA) and 5.6 at% Ir/R-MnO2 (SA), respectively. Inspection of the micrographs shows that both materials are primarily composed of

**Figure 2.** a) and b) TEM images for 5.6 at % Ir/β-MnO<sub>2</sub> (SA) and c) and d) TEM images for Ir/β-MnO<sub>2</sub> (HT).

thin sheet morphologies, showing nano-dimensioned particles ranging from <10 to  $\sim100$  nm. As these materials are predominantly  $Ir/\beta$ -MnO<sub>2</sub> and Ir/R-MnO<sub>2</sub> (confirmed by XRD Figure 1a and Figure S1), we infer that the thinner sheets are composed of smaller clusters of nano-dimensioned particles, while the darker features are associated with aggregates (e.g., stacking) of these particles.  $Ir/\beta$ -MnO<sub>2</sub> (HT) is composed of larger particles in the range of  $\sim200$ –300 nm with denser aggregate-like morphologies (Figure 2c and d), based on the particles appearing much darker than those particles in the TEM images associated with  $Ir/\beta$ -MnO<sub>2</sub> (SA). The structure of  $Ir/\beta$ -MnO<sub>2</sub> (HT) is comprised of both nano and micron-sized particles evident from secondary electron microscopy (SEM) (Figure S4).

The variation in morphologies may relate to the way Ir is integrated into the β-MnO<sub>2</sub> lattice and exposed to the reaction intermediates. Due to the use of SDS surfactant (reducing and structure inducing agent) in Ir/β-MnO<sub>2</sub> (SA), a slower redox reaction was ensured which inhibited homogeneous nucleation and restricted the formation of large precipitates unlike Ir/β-MnO<sub>2</sub> (HT).<sup>[15]</sup> This may result in uniform doping of Ir for Ir/β-MnO<sub>2</sub> (SA), with increased access to active sites due to its nanosized particles and thin-sheet like morphology. [13,20] On the other hand for Ir/β-MnO<sub>2</sub> (HT), the homogeneous nucleation and large precipitate from a surfactant-free synthesis may lead to nonuniform Ir-doping and limited access to active sites due to its aggregate-like morphology. It is shown later that the OER performance of  $Ir/\beta$ -MnO<sub>2</sub> (SA) is greater than  $Ir/\beta$ -MnO<sub>2</sub> (HT) and the different morphologies with different dispersion of Ir in the structure might have played a crucial role in their ability to catalyze OER in an acidic medium.

SEM images of 5.6 at%  $Ir/\beta$ -MnO<sub>2</sub> (SA) and 5.6 at% Ir/R-MnO<sub>2</sub> (SA) are shown in Figure S5a and Figure S7a, respectively.

Both of the SEM micrographs show a nanoflake-like morphology, unlike the SEM images for  $Ir/\beta$ -MnO<sub>2</sub> (HT) (Figure S4) which highlight the micron-sized and aggregate-like morphology. Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) data for  $Ir/\beta$ -MnO<sub>2</sub> (SA) and Ir/R-MnO<sub>2</sub> (SA) structures (Figure S5b and Figure S7b) show a homogeneous distribution of Mn, O, Ir, with low concentrations of K and Cl (<1 at%). EDS area mapping and point analysis spectra of  $Ir/\beta$ -MnO<sub>2</sub> (SA) and Ir/R-MnO<sub>2</sub> (SA) are shown in Figure S6 and Figure S8, respectively. Table S1 presents the atomic percentages (at%) for all the materials, averaging the values determined from EDS area mapping and point analysis.

Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface areas displayed in Table S2 show that the surface area for Ir/ $\beta$ -MnO $_2$  (SA) is lower than Ir/R-MnO $_2$  (SA). For example, the BET surface area is 148 m $^2$  g $^{-1}$  for 5.6 at% Ir/R-MnO $_2$  (SA) while it is 108 m $^2$ g $^{-1}$  for 5.6 at% Ir/ $\beta$ -MnO $_2$  (SA). Furthermore, the surface area of Ir/ $\beta$ -MnO $_2$  (SA) is 18% higher than the Ir/ $\beta$ -MnO $_2$  (HT), emphasizing that during the synthesis of Ir/ $\beta$ -MnO $_2$  (SA) the surfactant played a role in stabilizing smaller particles to obtain a more highly dispersed Ir/MnO $_2$  structure with thin-sheet like morphology, compared to Ir/ $\beta$ -MnO $_2$  (HT) where a surfactant-free method was used.

#### **Electrochemical Characterization**

#### **OER Activity**

The OER activities of Ir/R-MnO<sub>2</sub> (SA), Ir/β-MnO<sub>2</sub> (SA) and control samples were evaluated with linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) in an acidic electrolyte medium (0.5 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>). Figure S9 depicts the experimental set-up and electrodes used for the electrochemical measurements. Figure 3 exhibits LSV data for 5.6 at % Ir/R-MnO<sub>2</sub> (SA), 5.6 at % Ir/β-MnO<sub>2</sub> (SA), IrO<sub>2</sub>, IrO<sub>2</sub> (rutile) and β-MnO<sub>2</sub>. All the data were normalized by the electrode geometric

area (geo). Analysis of the LSV data (Figure 3 and Table 1) show that Ir/ $\beta$ -MnO $_2$  (SA) has the highest OER activity, based on its relatively low OER overpotential (at 10 mA cm $_{\rm geo}^{-2}$ ),  $\eta$ , of 327  $\pm$  5 mV. Ir/R-MnO $_2$  (SA) exhibited a higher  $\eta$  of 336  $\pm$ 3 mV. The overpotentials associated with these electrocatalysts were ~400 mV lower than pristine  $\beta$ -MnO $_2$ , and ~84–150 mV lower than IrO $_2$  at similar Ir loadings (75.6  $\mu$ g<sub>ir</sub> cm $_{\rm geo}^{-2}$ ). The OER activities of Ir/R-MnO $_2$  (SA) and Ir/ $\beta$ - MnO $_2$  (SA) at other Ir at% values are presented in Table S3 and Figure S10.

To better compare the intrinsic activities of these catalysts, the current densities associated with the samples were normalized by their BET (from Table S2) and electrochemical surface areas (ECSA, from Table S3 and Figure S11). 5.6 at% Ir/β-MnO₂ (SA) showed the highest intrinsic activity using either normalization method (Figures S12 and S13). The electrocatalyst outperformed IrO₂, and all the other control samples used in this study. Next, Tafel slopes were calculated and the data are presented in Table 1 and Table S3. The 5.6 at% Ir/β-MnO₂ (SA) exhibited the lowest Tafel slope (99  $\pm 6$  mV dec $^{-1}$ ), compared to IrO₂ (234  $\pm 7$  mV dec $^{-1}$ ), IrO₂ (rutile, 291  $\pm 6$  mV dec $^{-1}$ ) and  $\beta$ -MnO₂ (211  $\pm 22$  mV dec $^{-1}$ ). These data suggest that the Ir/β-MnO₂ (SA) presents a catalytic surface that can improve the kinetics of the rate-determining step for the OER, compared to IrO₂ and pristine MnO₂ phases. [11]

To further quantify the activity metrics for the different samples, the turnover frequency (TOF,  $ms_{lr}^{-1}$ ) and mass activity (MA,  $Ag_{lr}^{-1}$ ) at 1.53 V vs RHE are presented in Figure 4 and Table 1. For the same 75.6  $\mu g_{lr} \, cm_{geo}^{-2}$  loading, both Ir/R-MnO<sub>2</sub> (SA) and Ir/ $\beta$ -MnO<sub>2</sub> (SA) showed similar activities and both electrocatalysts outperformed IrO<sub>2</sub>.

We note that an analysis of the data presented in Table S3 shows that some Ir/MnO $_2$  (SA) catalysts exhibit a superior OER activity ( $\eta$ , TOF, and MA), compared to 5.6 at% Ir/ $\beta$ -MnO $_2$  (SA). The catalytic stabilities of those catalysts, however, are inferior to 5.6 at% Ir/ $\beta$ -MnO $_2$  (SA). Based on our previous research the reactivity of Ir/MnO $_2$  structures cannot be determined solely by the amount of Ir present. The R-MnO $_2$  structure is thermodynamically less stable than rutile  $\beta$ -MnO $_2$ , so the Ir/R-MnO $_2$  structure may have structural defects that provide greater flexibility than Ir/ $\beta$ -MnO $_2$ . The defects and flexibility can drive reactivity, resulting in 4.2 at% Ir/R-MnO $_2$  (SA) being more active than 4.2 at% Ir/ $\beta$ -MnO $_2$  (SA). However, as Ir-doping increases in Ir/R-MnO $_2$  (SA), the active sites may be affected (altering defect and flexibility levels), leading to a decrease in activity: 4.2 at% Ir/R-MnO $_2$  (SA) > 4.5 at% Ir/R-MnO $_2$  (SA) > 5.6 at% Ir/R-MnO $_2$

(SA). Conversely, once the structure transforms into rutile Ir/ $\beta$ -MnO $_2$  (SA), its unique chemistry (with fewer defects and lower bond flexibility) and higher Ir loading enhances the intrinsic activity and stability, resulting in 5.6 at% Ir/ $\beta$ -MnO $_2$  (SA) being more active than both 5.6 at% Ir/R-MnO $_2$  and lower Ir-loaded Ir/ $\beta$ -MnO $_2$  (SA): 5.6 at% Ir/ $\beta$ -MnO $_2$  (SA) > 4.5 at% Ir/ $\beta$ -MnO $_2$  (SA) > 4.2 at% Ir/ $\beta$ -MnO $_2$  (SA).

Also, based on the data in Table S3, the OER activity of  $Ir/\beta$ -MnO $_2$  (SA) is superior to  $Ir/\beta$ -MnO $_2$  (HT), where  $Ir/\beta$ -MnO $_2$  (HT) has an  $\eta$  of  $358\pm7$  mV (along with lower intrinsic activity, TOF and MA) on a per Ir-mass basis. Our results suggest that despite the presence of a similar Ir–O–Mn bonding motif, it is likely that the nanoflake-like structure and a more uniform substitution of Ir in  $Ir/\beta$ -MnO $_2$  (SA) enhanced the number of accessible active sites, leading to improved OER activity compared to  $Ir/\beta$ -MnO $_2$  (HT).

# **OER Stability**

Chronopotentiometry was performed to determine the electrocatalytic stability of 5.6 at% Ir/R-MnO<sub>2</sub> (SA), 5.6 at% Ir/ $\beta$ -MnO<sub>2</sub> (SA), Ir/ $\beta$ -MnO<sub>2</sub> (HT), IrO<sub>2</sub>, IrO<sub>2</sub> (rutile) and  $\beta$ -MnO<sub>2</sub>. Inspection of the data in Figure 5 shows that Ir/ $\beta$ -MnO<sub>2</sub> (SA) exhibits the highest stability (50 h) and during this time window, it maintains a  $\eta$  of 470 mV (or 1.7 V vs RHE). In addition, after ~72 hours, the electrocatalyst continues to sustain an  $\eta$  of

The stability numbers for Mn and Ir ( $S_{Mn}^{\#}$  and  $S_{Ir}^{\#}$ ) and the corresponding % Mn and Ir losses were experimentally measured to further quantify the stability of the catalysts (Figures 6 and 7 and Table 2 and Table S4).  $S_{Mn}^{\#}$  is defined as "moles of  $O_2$  per moles of Mn lost" and  $S_{Ir}^{\#}$ , as "moles of  $O_2$  per moles of Ir lost during electrolysis". The moles of Mn and Ir lost from the catalyst were determined by analyzing the electrolyte with Inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). Based on prior literature, a  $S^{\#} \geq 10^4$  is typically considered to be a good catalyst stability.<sup>[21]</sup>

 $^{[a]}$  Except for  $\beta$ -MnO $_2$ , all chronopotentiometry studies were conducted under a maximum working potential of 2.1 V vs RHE. Detailed data is presented in Table S4.

Inspection of Table 2, Table S4 and Figure 6, shows that after 24 h of OER,  $Ir/\beta$ -MnO<sub>2</sub> (SA) exhibited a 4% loss of Mn ( $S_{Ir}^{\#} = 2 \times 10^{5}$ ) and a 2% loss of Ir ( $S_{Ir}^{\#} = 7 \times 10^{5}$ ). After 48 h, 10% of

8673899,

Mn ( $S_{Mn}^{\#}=2\times10^{5}$ ) and 6% of Ir ( $S_{Ir}^{\#}=5\times10^{5}$ ) were lost into the electrolyte. Finally, after 72 h the catalysts lost a total of 12% Mn ( $S_{Mn}^{\#}=2\times10^{5}$ ) and 8% Ir ( $S_{Ir}^{\#}=6\times10^{5}$ ), while maintaining a potential under 1.8 vs RHE. In contrast, while Ir/R-MnO<sub>2</sub> (SA) had a similar activity as Ir/ $\beta$ -MnO<sub>2</sub> (SA), the material lost a significant amount of Mn and Ir (15% and 20% respectively) over a 24 h period, Figure S14. Interestingly, Ir/ $\beta$ -MnO<sub>2</sub> (HT) (Figure 7a) showed instability after 24 h with a 6% loss of Mn ( $S_{Mn}^{\#}=1\times10^{5}$ ) and a 4% loss of Ir ( $S_{Ir}^{\#}=3\times10^{5}$ ). Comparing Ir/ $\beta$ -MnO<sub>2</sub> (SA) and Ir/ $\beta$ -MnO<sub>2</sub> (HT) after 24 h, Ir/ $\beta$ -MnO<sub>2</sub> (SA) shows much better stability with a lower loss of active metal (Table 2 and Table S4).

Data for OER on  $IrO_2$  exhibits a steep rise in potential after only ~20 h (Figure 5) and lower  $S_{ir}^{\#}$  than  $Ir/\beta$ -MnO $_2$  (SA) (Figure 7b and Table S4). Similar results were observed for  $IrO_2$  rutile (Figure 5) where the potential to maintain 10 mAcm<sup>-2</sup> rapidly increased above 2 V and demonstrated reasonable  $S_{ir}^{\#}$  and Ir loss (Table 2 and Figure S15) during the ~12 h stability test. Pristine  $\beta$ -MnO $_2$  exhibited a comparatively poor stability of 2 h (Figure 5) with $S_{Mn}^{\#}$ ~10<sup>3</sup> and a 6% Mn loss. It is important to note that by doping Ir into the MnO $_2$  structure (i.e.  $Ir/\beta$ -MnO $_2$  (SA)), the stability of the host structure improved ( $S_{Mn}^{\#}$ ~10<sup>5</sup> with only 12% Mn loss after 72 h).

We believe that the enhanced OER activity and stability of Ir/β-MnO<sub>2</sub> (SA) can be attributed to the accessibility of Ir active sites in the nano-sized particles and the relatively uniform inclusion of Ir into the MnO<sub>2</sub> lattice, with thermodynamically stable Ir-O-Mn bonding units. We also believe that the surfactant assisted method-involving a slow redox reaction between the surfactant, Mn-precursor and Ir-precursor to form Ir-O-Mn bonds, restricts the formation of aggregates promoting the formation of nano-sized Ir/R-MnO<sub>2</sub> (SA) particles that better disperse the Ir active sites. This dispersion of Ir remains after heating of Ir/R- MnO<sub>2</sub> (SA) to form Ir/β-MnO<sub>2</sub> (SA) which is stable at low pH OER conditions, presumably due to the bond strength of Ir-O-Mn in the rutile structure. [14] Based on prior research, we speculate that the Ir-O-Mn bonding results in an OER-favorable overlap between Ir(5d) and O(2p) compared to IrO<sub>2</sub>. This overlap may promote the filling of the Ir e<sub>a</sub> orbital reducing the crystal field splitting energy (CFSE) between  $e_q$ and  $t_{2\alpha}$  orbitals, thus facilitating intermediate binding and an  $\,$ improvement in the intrinsic OER activity and stability of the structure.[22]

Furthermore, it has been shown in prior studies that the introduction of precious metals like Ir or Ru into  $MnO_2$  leads to OER via a lattice oxygen mediated mechanism (LOM). [20] Electrocatalysts that generate gaseous  $O_2$  from water oxidation via the LOM necessarily go through a reaction step that includes the loss of lattice oxygen and the subsequent incorporation of this oxygen into the dioxygen product. To maintain a catalytic cycle with LOM a local oxygen vacancy is filled via the adsorption and subsequent deprotonation of OH (e.g., from the dissociation of water). The maintenance of the catalytic cycle is not a given, since prior studies have shown that the metastability of the oxygen vacancy can lead to surface restructuring and metal cation loss from the lattice. For  $Ir/\beta$ -MnO<sub>2</sub> (SA), we suggest based on the OER activity and stability of the electrocatalyst that the Ir-O-Mn motif efficiently leads to the rapid filling of

the oxygen vacancy by OH $^{-}$  via the dissociation of H $_2$ O at Ir sites. This chemistry globally reduces the  $\eta$  and effectively catalyzes OER under 1.84 V vs RHE while suppressing the conversion of MnO $_2$  to MnO $_4$  and IrO $_2$  to IrO $_4$ . This suppression prevents the leaching out of MnO $_4$  and IrO $_4$  from the structure and prevents structural degradation by stabilizing the MnO $_2$  host structure as well as reducing the loss of OER active metal Ir. [9]

Among published works (Table S5) concerned with OER on Ir-bearing catalysts, we find that competing catalysts tend to either have an increased stability under chronoamperometry with higher loading (ZnNiColrMn, $^{[23]}$  IrO $_{\rm x}$  nH $_{\rm 2}$ O, $^{[24]}$  UF–Ir/IrO $_{\rm 2}$ , $^{[25]}$ Ir-doped  $\gamma$ -MnO<sub>2</sub><sup>[26]</sup>) or utilizing a lower loading of active material in exchange for reduced stability (Ir-SA/NC, [27]  $Mn_{0.8}Ir_{0.2}O_v$  nano hybrid). [28] Catalysts which utilize a similar Ir loading and overpotential (IrO<sub>2</sub> α-MnO<sub>2</sub><sup>[29]</sup> and Ir-doped cryptomelane<sup>[22]</sup>) tend to have an inferior stability to Ir/β-MnO<sub>2</sub> (SA). It is worth noting that keying in on overpotential alone does not give a reliable indication towards catalyst stability, as demonstrated by materials such as Ir-doped  $\gamma$ -MnO<sub>2</sub><sup>[26]</sup>,  $(Mn_{0.8}Ir_{0.2}O_2)O_2$  nanorods<sup>[30]</sup> and  $Ir_{0.25}Mn_{0.1}O_{0.65}$ .<sup>[31]</sup> In addition, stability cannot be attributed solely to catalyst loading and structure, as exemplified by the strained layered IrMnO<sub>2</sub> nanosheets<sup>[32]</sup> in comparison to Ir/β-MnO<sub>2</sub> (SA), IrO<sub>2</sub> α-MnO<sub>2</sub><sup>[29]</sup> and the Mn-doped IrRu nano cactus.[33] Overall, the research presented in this paper contributes towards the synthesis and characterization of a new class of Ir/MnO<sub>2</sub> catalysts and presents an understanding of their structural advantages and limitations towards acidic OER catalysis. These findings offer valuable insights for the design of future Ir-based hybrid metal oxide structures, i.e., incorporating Ir-O-Mn-O-X bonding, where X is an earth-abundant element. This bonding motif may present an opportunity to perform robust acidic OER catalysis with low Ir loadings.

# Summary

A Ir/β-MnO<sub>2</sub> (SA) electrocatalyst with a low loading of Ir (5.6 at%) was successfully developed by a surfactant-assisted (SA) method. The catalyst demonstrated excellent acidic OER catalysis due to the presence of Ir doped into the β-MnO<sub>2</sub> lattice.  $Ir/\beta\text{-MnO}_2$  (SA) exhibited an OER  $\eta$  of  $327\pm5$  mV, and showed relatively constant stability at a η of 534 mV up to 72 h, in 0.5 M  $H_2SO_4$ . This stability was associated with  $S_{M_2}^{\#} = 2 \times 10^5$ (4% loss in Mn) and  $S_{lr}^{\#} = 7 \times 10^{5}$  (2% loss of Ir) after 24 h and with  $S_{Mn}^{\#} = 2 \times 10^5$  (12% loss in Mn) and  $S_{Ir}^{\#} = 7 \times 10^5$  (8% loss of Ir) after 72 h. At an Ir-loading of 75.6  $\mu g_{lr} \, cm_{geo}^{-2}$ , Ir/ $\beta$ -MnO $_2$  (SA) outperformed IrO2 as well as other Ir/MnO2 controls in this study. This superior performance of  $Ir/\beta$ -MnO<sub>2</sub> (SA) was attributed to a uniform distribution of Ir-O-Mn bonding which played a crucial role in stabilizing both Mn and Ir in the structure and to its nano-sized particles with thin sheet-like morphology with increased accessibility to active sites. Overall, the results demonstrate a promising structural motif that can serve as a valuable guide for designing highly efficient and low-

loaded precious metals based OER catalysts for acidic environments.

# **Experimental Section**

# **Chemicals**

All the chemicals employed in this study were used as received from the supplier without further purification. Potassium permanganate (KMnO4, 99.2%), sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS, C12H25NaO4S, 99%), isopropyl alcohol (C3H8O, 99.9%), potassium hydroxide (KOH, 85.8%), nitric acid (HNO3, 68–70 w/w%), sulfuric acid (H2SO4, 95.8 w/w %), and hydrochloric acid (HCl, 36.5–38 w/v %) were obtained from Fisher chemicals. Iridium (III) chloride hydrate (IrCl3�H2O) was purchased from Pressure Chemicals. Ammonium persulfate ((NH4)2S2O8) and manganese (II) nitrate hydrate (Mn(NO3)2�H2O) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Iridium oxide (IrO2) was purchased from Strem Chemicals. Deionized (DI) water (18 MΩcm) was used for all synthesis procedures.

# **Synthesis**

For the synthesis of Ir/R-MnO2 (SA), a one-step surfactant-assisted (SA) method reported for the synthesis of MnO2 nanosheets was followed with modification.[15] Here, SDS was used as a reducing agent, such that SDS was hydrolyzed to dodecanol, which subsequently reacted with KMnO4, resulting in the formation of MnO2 nanosheets (without the presence of Ir, discussed in SI).[15] SDS also played the role of structure inducing agent (or capping agent), as a high reaction rate in MnO2 synthesis leads to large precipitates of non-oriented particles due to homogeneous nucleation.[15] To obtain well-shaped and well-dispersed MnO2 nanosheets, it is crucial to slow down the reaction rate and inhibit the resulting homogeneous nucleation. Previously, it has been reported that MnO2 nanosheets could be obtained by restraining the reaction rate with chelating agents or interface reactions. In this case, SDS, as a precursor to the reductant dodecanol, controls the process.[15] Compared to direct dodecanol addition, gradual SDS hydrolysis ensures a slower redox reaction, leading to the controlled formation of single-layer nanosheets. Remarkably, when Ir was introduced into this one-step surfactant-assisted (SA) method, the resulting product was Ir doped in R-MnO2 with nanosized particles, rather than Ir doped in δ-MnO2 nanosheets. The synthetic steps leading to this outcome is elaborated below.

**Ir/R-MnO2 (SA)**: To 310 mL of DI water, 0.92 g of sodium dodecyl sulfate and 3.2 mL of 0.1 M H2SO4 were added and refluxed for 10 min. Under continuous stirring and a constant temperature of 100°C, 6.4 mL of 50 mM KMnO4 and 5 mL of 6.32 mM IrCl3.H2O were added. The Ir(III) solution was made using N2 purged DI water. This solution was refluxed for 1 hr to obtain a black residue. The solution was immediately transferred to a beaker for decantation. After 1–2 hrs, once the solution had cooled to room temperature, the excess supernatant containing DI with SDS was decanted, and the dark residue was collected by washing it four times with DI water followed by centrifugation at 6000 rpm for 10 mins. The dark residue was lyophilized and stored under a vacuum. This surfactant-assisted (SA) method resulted in 5.6 at% Ir/R-MnO2 with nano-sized flake-like morphology. The mass of IrCl3.H2O in this reaction was varied to use 10 mg, 12 mg and 14 mg to obtain 4.2 at%, 4.5 at% and 5.6 at% Ir/R-MnO2 respectively, and their OER performance was investigated. All Ir/R-MnO2 showed good OER activity (see SI) but limited stability of �24 h. To improve the stability, the Ir/R-MnO2 (SA) structures were subjected to a postsynthesis modification as reported below.

**Ir/β-MnO2 (SA)**: 30 mg of Ir/R-MnO2 was annealed at 400°C for 1 h with a ramp rate 50°Ch-1 in an electrical oven furnace, under air and ambient pressure to obtain phase transformed Ir/β-MnO2 (SA).

**Ir/β-MnO2 (HT)**: A one-step hydrothermal synthesis (without surfactant) was carried out to obtain Ir/β-MnO2 with micron-sized aggregate-like morphology (for the purpose of a control material). In a 50 mL centrifuge tube, 158 mg of KMnO4 and 715.8 mg of Mn(NO3)2.H2O were dissolved in 20 mL of purged DI water and sonicated for 30 mins. In another 50 mL centrifuge tube, 200 mg of IrCl3.H2O was dissolved in another 20 mL of N2 purged DI water and sonicated for 15 mins. Once the precursor salts dissolved, they were transferred to a 40 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave container. The mixture was sealed and heated in a furnace at 100°C for 2 h with a heating-cooling ramp rate of 50°Ch-1. Once the reaction mixture cooled down, a dark-brown colored residue was obtained which was washed 5 times with DI and followed by centrifugation at 6000 rmp, 10 mins and then concentrated at 14000 rpm for 2 mins. This product was further annealed at 400°C for 1 h at a ramp rate of 50 � C h <sup>1</sup> , under air and ambient pressure to obtain a single phase of the Ir/β-MnO2 (rutile). The final product obtained was characterized by XRD and determined to be β-MnO2 (or rutile) with 3.6 at% Ir doped into the MnO2 lattice.

**β-MnO2**: The synthesis β-MnO2 followed a reported synthetic method with slight modification. In brief, 0.1 M of (NH4)2S2O8 and 0.1 M of Mn(NO3)2�xH2O were added and diluted by DI to achieve a total volume of 40 mL.[34] This mixture was stirred for 5 min at room temperature and transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave container. The mixture was sealed and heated in a furnace at 160°C for 5 h with a heating-cooling ramp rate of 50 � C h <sup>1</sup> . After cooling, the mixture was washed 3 times with DI water and dried overnight to obtain a black product. This product was further annealed at 400°C for 1 h under ambient air to remove any R-MnO2 impurity. The final product obtained was characterized by XRD and determined to be the β-MnO2 phase of MnO2.

## **Materials Characterization**

XRD was carried out using a Bruker D8 advance A25 powder diffractometer with Cu Kα1 radiation and a Johansson monochromator. Prior to analysis, samples were ground and placed on a Si low background sample holder (Bruker AXS). SEM images were acquired on a FEI Quanta 450 FEG SEM instrument operating at 30 kV. For image mapping, EDS was performed with an Oxford systems nanoanalysis EDS system attached to a FEI Quanta 450 FEG SEM operating at 30 kV. The samples for imaging and mapping were prepared by suspending the samples in isopropyl alcohol, sonicating for 15 minutes, and then drop-casting the suspension on a Si wafer (university wafer, type P/B). TEM images were obtained by using a JEOL JEM-1400 instrument, operating at 120 kV. The samples were prepared by suspending and sonicating them in isopropyl alcohol for 15 minutes and then drop-casting the suspension onto 300 mesh size, Tedpella copper grids.

BET surface area measurements were carried out via N2 adsorption at 77 K using a Quantachrome BET surface area analyzer. ICP-OES was performed using a Thermo Scientific iCAP 7000 Series spectrometer to quantify the concentration of any dissolved Mn and Ir in the electrolyte after OER.

# **Electrochemical Characterization**

Carbon paper (MGL370 20 cm×20 cm, from Fuel cell earth) with a 2 cm<sup>2</sup> area was used as a working electrode. The carbon paper was used without any pre-treatment. Samples for analysis were prepared by adding 4 mg of the catalyst powder of interest to 4 mg

of carbon (VulcanXC-72), 35  $\mu$ L of Nafion solution (5% in alcohol, Ion Power Inc.), and 1 mL of isopropyl alcohol. The resulting catalyst ink was sonicated for 30 min and 140  $\mu$ L of the suspension was drop-cast on the carbon paper electrode (resulting in a 0.27 mg cm<sup>-2</sup> catalyst loading). The carbon paper with the catalyst ink was air-dried for 2 min before analysis.

Electrochemical studies were carried out using a CHI 660E potentiostat operating in a standard three-electrode configuration at ambient temperature ( $22\pm2\,^{\circ}$ C). All the potentials were measured with respect to a standard calomel reference electrode (SCE, CH instruments) and a graphite (Fuel cell store) counter electrode in 0.5 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>. Polarization curves were recorded at a 5 mV s<sup>-1</sup> scan rate and the curves were replicated 3 times after 100% iR corrections. The equation,  $E_{RHE}\,{=}\,E_{SCE}\,{+}\,(E^o_{SCE}\,{+}\,0.059~pH)$  was used to reference the potential from the SCE to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) potential. The overpotential  $(\eta)$  for the OER was calculated as  $\eta = E_{RHE}$ -1.23 V, where  $E_{RHE}$  was the potential at a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. Tafel plots were obtained by plotting current density (j) - potential data in the form of log j vs η. The ECSA was determined by measuring the capacitive current ( $\Delta i = i_a - i_b$ j<sub>c</sub>) at various scan-rates. This capacitive current is associated with the charging of the double-layer at different scan rates such that, the double-layer capacitance (C<sub>dl</sub>) is proportional to half of the linear slope. [35] For this measurement, the cyclic voltammetry curves were measured at scan rates of 40, 60, 80, 100, and 120 mV s<sup>-1</sup> at a potential window of 0.5-0.6 V vs SCE. The ECSA was calculated using the following equation,

$$A_{ECSA}$$
 (cm<sup>2</sup><sub>ECSA</sub>) =  $\frac{Double layer capacitance (mF) per 1 cm^2}{Specific capacitance (mF cm-2)}$ 

where the specific capacitance was taken to be 0.04 mF  $cm^{-2}$ . [7,36] TOF and the mass activity of the different electrocatalysts were calculated as detailed in the SI. The stability of the catalyst was analyzed by chronopotentiometry (without iR correction) at a constant current density of 10 mA cm $_{\rm geo}^{-2}$  and quantified by calculating the stability number (S $^{\#}$ ) of the catalysts (see detail in the SI).

**The key to increasing the rate of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) lies in accelerated four-electron dynamics, while the key to facilitating the development of supercapacitors lies in the design of electrode materials. This paper synthesized manganese-iron Prussian blue (MnFe-PBA@IF) at room temperature, and hexagonal concave structures w ere prepared using a fast-reducing matrix. Interestingly, MnFe-PBA@IF has an amorphous structure favorable to exposing more active surfaces. According to Gibbs free energy calculations on MnFe-PBA, charge depletion of manganese atoms can greatly enhance the adsorption of electron-rich oxygen-containing groups on the surface. Furthermore, the overpotential in 1 m KOH is 280 mV. Also, it can be used as a supercapacitor with a stable operating voltage range of −0.9–0 V and a specific capacity of 1260 F g<sup>−</sup>1. This work provides new insights into the synthesis of OER catalysts for Prussian blue ferromanganese at room temperature. Non-gold-bonded adsorption, highly active metal centers and active surfaces are the underlying reasons for the superior performance of supercapacitors. Therefore, Prussian blue with good energy storage performance and high active surface can be used as multifunctional energy storage and conversion electrodes.**

**1. Introduction**

Faced with the energy crisis, new energy production capacity and efficient energy storage is the efficient way to sustainable development. On the road to production capacity, the use of water resources has accelerated the vigorous development of electrocatalytic water splitting.[1–6] Compared with the other two reactions, oxygen evolution reaction (OER) involves a four-electron process with slow kinetics and needs to overcome a larger energy barrier.[7–13] Some precious metal-based oxygen evolution catalysts such as RuO2 and IrO2, are not suitable for large-scale production applications due to the lack of material resources.[14–19] In addition, energy utilization must have efficient energy storage channels. As we all know, the supercapacitor is an electrochemical energy storage device widely used in smart grids, hybrid vehicles, and electronic devices. According to the energy storage mchanism, capacitors can be divided into electric double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) and pseudo-capacitors (PCs). EDLCs have a large voltage window and short charge– discharge time due to the energy provided by the electric double layer. PCs store energy by redox reaction, with a small voltage window and long charge–discharge time.

Interestingly, Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) derived from metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have a hexagonal rectangular structure, abundant active sites and easy-to-control morphology.[20–27] However, its main disadvantages are a narrow band gap, fast electron-hole recombination, and poor

conductivity, which greatly limits its feasibility as an OER catalyst and supercapacitor. [28-34] Herein, we developed a cubic ferromanganese Prussian blue material on iron foam (IF) to modulate the surface amorphous layer at room temperature. In addition, by rapidly reducing PBA to a concave structure cube, the active area (ESCA) is increased and the OER energy barrier is accelerated. More surprisingly, through the regulation of surface engineering and the coordination effect of iron-manganese double transition metals, the amorphous layer structure is increased, the electron density is adjusted, and the main shortcomings of PBAs are overcome, which promotes the performance of PBA as a negative pseudocapacitor and realizes the energy storage characteristics of ultra-high specific capacitance. It exhibits excellent electrochemical performance and pseudocapacitive performance in 1 м КОН solution. The overpotential of MnFe-PBA @ IF is 280 mV@10  $mAcm^{-2}$ , and the specific capacitance is as high as 1260 F  $g^{-1}$ .

## 2. Results and Discussion

#### 2.1. Structure and Composition

The composition of the sample was analyzed by the XRD pattern of MnFe-PBA@IF (Figure 1a). Weak Bragg diffraction peaks were observed at 20.2°, 23.8°, 29.4° and 32.7°, 34°, 40.9°, 52.1°, 65.6° corresponding to Mn<sub>2</sub>Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub> (PDF#24-0580), confirming the presence of Mn<sub>2</sub>Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub> component. The slight shift and ultra-long broad peak of multiple low peaks between 20 and 34 may be caused by the amorphous layer on the surface of the synthesized sample. One reason is that most of the atoms in the crystal grains are arranged in a long-range disorder, causing the lattice constant to change, which shows an ultra-long and wide peak in the XRD characteristic peak.<sup>[35,36]</sup> Second, the atoms near the grain boundary are no longer in the perfect periodic potential field, and the lattice in which they are located cannot be the same as the grain center, resulting in lattice distortion, which generates a small angular shift of the diffraction peaks of the sample.

Last but not least, the small grain size makes a partial distortion of the diffraction peaks at the edges. The final synthesized sample is Mn<sub>2</sub>Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub> with a special structure owing to a long-range disordered amorphous structure.

In addition, strong peaks at 44.6°, 65°, and 82.3° correspond to the peaks of Fe (PDF#06-0696). The strong Bragg diffraction peak at 65.6° is attributed to the presence of Mn<sub>2</sub>Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub>. The diffraction peaks of MnFe-PBA@IF-1 and MnFe-PBA@IF-2 are basically consistent with MnFe-PBA@IF, and the components are successfully synthesized. The obvious peak at 17.3°, 24.7°, 35.1°, 39.4°, 57.1° in the XRD pattern (Figure S1, Supporting Information) correspond to Fe<sub>4</sub>(Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub>)<sub>3</sub> (PDF#01-0239). The obvious peaks at 19.493°, 21.4°, 28.2°, 21.7°, 29.2°, 34.9°, 37.5° correspond to  $Zn_3(Fe(CN)_6)_2$  (PDF#25-1022). The Fe (PDF\*06-0696) peak corresponds to 44.6°, 65°, and 82.3°, respectively.

The initial morphology without regulation is to maintain the shape of PBA (Figure S2a, Supporting Information). The concave structure of each surface of MnFe-PBA@IF grown on the IF surface by room temperature reduction regulation is obvious (Figure S2b, Supporting Information), which promotes the uniform dispersion of the surfactant and increases the surface energy. Furthermore, the number of active sites on each surface increased from the initial 2D single-sided active sites to 3D fivesided active sites, which greatly increased the active specific surface area (ESCA) and area-specific activity (SA). It is worth noting that from Figure S2, Supporting Information, it can be intuitively found that the skeleton becomes a 3D porous surface after etching (plane skeleton before etching). The reason is that the acid ions in the synthesis solution have the ability to surface corrosion within 8 h at room temperature. This greatly increases the PBA growth area and develops a porous skeleton structure.

The TEM image in Figure 2a shows that after etching reduction, not only PBA nanocubes can be obtained (the lower right corner is one of them), but also the desired amorphous layer can be obtained by surface roughening, and very few can be transformed into PBA nanosheets by etching or reduction. In addition, a thin amorphous layer appears around a single cube (Figure 2b), and the texture is more uniform. This amorphous layer can further prevent the loss of active sites caused by cube collapse caused by etching transformation. It is worth noting that each face of the cube is visible at a depth of about 29-34 nm, confirming previous speculations about active surface transformation. Some unreduced PBA crystal layers appear in Figure 2c,d), and the lattice spaces are 1.63, 1.7, and 1.07 nm, respectively, corresponding to the presence of amorphous layers in the FFT diagram (upper right corner of Figure 2c). The lattice fringes have a clear orientation relationship with the amorphous layer of the PBA cube (as shown in the red arrow in Figure 2e,f). The nanostructures synthesized by MnFe-PBA@IF are homogeneous, with a distinct concave structure, and uniform elemental synthesis (SEM Figure 2g,h, mapping Figure 2i and EDS Figure S3, Supporting Information). Particularly interestingly, in the IF etched surface skeleton, the smooth surface is transformed into a porous suspended structure, enabling a two- to 3D growth environment on the substrate, greatly improving the synthesis of the active mate-

cannot reach the same reduction extent as ascorbic acid, giving rise to a situation with unobvious surface grooves as shown in Figure S4a,c, Supporting Information. Even worse, MnFe-PBA@IF is hardly reduced by citric acid, which results in almost no surface grooves and only curved edges (Figure S4b,d, Supporting Information). In addition, the influence of the metal center has been investigated. The growth morphology has been controlled by comparing Zn-Fe-based Prussian blue (Figure S5a-c, Supporting Information) and Fe-Fe-based Prussian blue (Figure S5d-f, Supporting Information) in the same environment. Disappointingly, they exhibit surface collapse, resulting in the loss of active sites. Obviously, Prussian blue prepared from Mn metal sites can be successfully synthesized as perfect highly reactive sixsided amorphous crystals under the rapid reduction of ascorbic acid. Last but not least is the stability of the catalyst. In Figure S6, Supporting Information, it is obvious that an oxygen evolution reaction after 12 h, MnFe-PBA@IF maintains its original cubic shape very well, indicating the advantage of its stable shape.

We analyzed the valence and structural composition of each element in iron-manganese Prussian blue by X-ray electron spectroscopy (XPS). According to the previous XPS research on ironmanganese bimetallic catalysts, the key elements of Fe (2p<sub>3/2</sub>), Mn (2p<sub>3/2</sub>), C, and N were fitted and analyzed.<sup>[37]</sup> Mn exhibits Mn<sup>2+</sup> at 641.3 eV<sup>[38]</sup> (Figure 3a) and Mn<sup>3+</sup> at 642.8 eV.<sup>[39]</sup> Finally, the satellite peak at 645.5 eV proves the importance of Mn<sup>2+</sup> valence in MnFe<sub>2</sub>(CN)<sub>6</sub> to the sample. For Fe, there are multiple peaks (Figure 3b). This part is likely to come from the deconvolution of Fe's  $2p_{3/2}$  orbit. The unpaired electrons in the orbit have multiple splitting, and 5 peaks are needed to fit well.  $^{[40,41]}$  The fitting residual of 8.07 eV is split between 710.3 and 718.6. The sample was mainly present in Fe<sup>2+</sup> at 710.7  $\pm$  0.05 eV (residual 3.79 eV), Fe<sup>3+</sup> at 711.6  $\pm$  0.02 eV (residual 4.28 eV), and the satellite peak was at  $718.6 \pm 0.6$  eV.<sup>[42]</sup> In addition, the elemental analysis of C shows that the peak at 288.6 eV corresponds to O—C=O, 284.8 eV is the characteristic peak of the C-C/C=C bond, and the characteristic peak of the C-N/C=N bond is 286.8 eV/285.7 eV (Figure 4c). [43] The N element in MnFe-PBA@IF has a weakly oxidized N peak and a C≡N main peak (Figure 4d). [44] Meanwhile, a full XPS plot of MnFe-PBA@IF (Figure S7, Supporting Information) illustrates the presence of each element.

### 2.2. Oxygen Evolution Function of MnFe-PBA@IF

This work compares the properties of ZnFe-PBA and Fe-PBA to understand the advantages of the manganese-iron bimetallic effect (Figure 4a,c). At an overpotential of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> ( $\eta_{10}$ ), MnFe-PBA@IF ( $\eta_{10} = 276 \text{ mV}$ ) outperforms ZnFe-PBA@IF ( $\eta_{10} =$ 347 mV) with FeFe-PBA@IF ( $\eta_{10} = 370$  mV) and plain iron foam  $(\eta_{10} = 556 \text{ mV})$ . Similarly, the Tafel slope for MnFe-PBA@IF is the smallest at 65.9 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>. Similarly, prepared ZnFe-PBA@IF and FeFe-PBA@IF show varying degrees of collapse, which leads to a deep reduction in active sites and resulted in poor OER performance. To explore the advantages of modifying synthetic samples by surface engineering, the OER properties of different reducing agents have been compared (Figure 4b,d): glucose (sample labeled as MnFe-PBA@IF-1), citric acid (sample labeled as MnFe-PBA@IF-2) and ascorbic acid (MnFe-PBA@IF). The overpotential of MnFe-PBA@IF ( $\eta_{10} = 276 \text{ mV}$ ) is better than those of MnFe-PBA@IF-1 ( $\eta_{10} = 335 \text{ mV}$ ), MnFe-PBA@IF-2 ( $\eta_{10} = 355 \text{ mV}$ ) mV) and plain foam iron ( $\eta_{10} = 556$  mV). Certainly, the Tafel slope of MnFe-PBA@IF (65.9 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>) shows obvious superiority.

The performance advantage of MnFe-PBA@IF reduced by ascorbic acid is clear, as the etched surface caused by the

reduction intensity (ascorbic acid*>*glucose*>*citric acid) is incomplete, in agreement with the previous discussion.

The impedance of MnFe-PBA@IF was further fitted to discuss its charge transfer strength. Based on the impedance fitting diagram in the upper right corner of **Figure 5**a), the transfer resistance (Rct) of MnFe-PBA@IF is 10.6 Ω, which is smaller than that of other Prussian blue contrast samples, which is basically consistent with the results of overpotential (LSV) and Tafel slope. Therefore, MnFe-PBA@IF can accelerate the charge mobility and efficiency and improve the catalytic reaction kinetics.

The stability of the catalyst is an important evaluation basis for the thermodynamic motion system in the catalytic process. We applied three different methods to monitor the stability of MnFe-PBA@IF. After the 1000th CV cycle, the LSV performance of MnFe-PBA@IF has almost no attenuation (Figure 5b). Also, the 12 h it curves test at a current density of 11 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> for 12 h showed a smooth curve (Figure 5c). In the final multipotential step, the stability of different potentials has been measured. From the 0.50 V to 0.68 V voltage range, every 1600 s without infrared compensation increased by 0.03 V (Figure 5d). The current density of each step is stable, and the final band regression 0.50 V interval almost coincides with the initial position, which indicates that the material has strong stability and it corresponds to each other. Finally, the electrochemically active surface area (ESCA) parameters considered to be electrochemical criteria were calculated using a Double-layer capacitance (Cdl), with Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) scan rates ranging from 20 to 120 mV s<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> and intervals of 10 mV s<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> (Figure S8a–e, Supporting Information).[45] The calculated Cdl of MnFe-PBA@IF is 3.27 mF cm<sup>−</sup>2(Figure S8f, Supporting Information), which indicates that the catalyst can more easily obtain electrochemically active sites in OER.

## **2.3. MnFe-PBA@IF as Supercapacitors**

The voltage window is determined by viewing the scanning CV curve. The voltage range of the positioning window is −0.9-0 V, and each curve has a redox peak. It shows that most of the energy comes from the redox reaction. Uniformly increase the CV area at different scan speeds and keep the shape intact (**Figure 6**a). By comparing the charge–discharge curves (GCD) at different current densities, it can be seen that the discharge time of MnFe-PBA@IF at 1 A g<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> is 1133 s (Figure 6b), indicating excellent specific capacitance. Interestingly, it can also be seen from the MnFe-PBA@IF discharge curve that the discharge region from the beginning to about 100 s and the charging region of 1900– 2200 s are relatively flat, probably due to the groove structure in MnFe-PBA@IF and the porous structure after etching the IF skeleton, as well as the electronegativity of C─N/C═C/C≡N that attracts ions to its surroundings. Of course, it is not excluded that there is still a little leakage current. When the amount of charge

Q is close to the leakage current, the GCD gradually flattens out and the charging speed decreases. Because of this, prompting its discharge time becomes longer, and the specific capacitance increases.

The calculation formula of the mass-specific capacitance of the Supercapacitor is as follows:

$$C_s = \frac{I \times \Delta t}{\Delta V \times m} \tag{1}$$

In the above formula, the mass-specific capacitance of the Cs capacitor, I represent the discharge current density, Δt represents the time required for the voltage drop at both ends of the capacitor during discharge, and m is the mass of the active material on the electrode.

The specific capacitance of MnFe-PBA@IF at 1 A g<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> a high specific capacitance of 1260 F g<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> (shown in Figure 6c), while the specific capacitances of 2, 3, 5, 10, and 15 A g<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> are 984, 867, 783, 700, and 633 F g<sup>−</sup>1, respectively. Less attenuation, excellent rate performance.

The calculation formula for the energy density/power density of the Supercapacitor is:

$$E = \frac{1}{2}C_s\Delta U^2 \tag{2}$$

$$P = \frac{E}{\Delta t}$$
 (3)

In the above formula, E is the energy density of the capacitor, P is the power density of the capacitor, the mass-specific capacitance of the Cs capacitor, ΔU represents the voltage change at both ends of the capacitor during discharge, and Δt represents the time required for the voltage drop at both ends of the capacitor during discharge. The energy density of MnFe-PBA@IF is 510.3 Wh kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> and the power density is 1625 W kg<sup>−</sup>1, which proves its excellent pseudocapacitive performance.

In the above equation, E is the energy density of the capacitor, P is the power density of the capacitor, Cs the mass over capacitance of the capacitor, ΔU represents the change in voltage across the capacitor during discharge, and Δt represents the time taken for the voltage across the capacitor to drop during discharge. The energy density of MnFe-PBA@IF is 510.3 W kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> and the power density is 1625 Wh kg<sup>−</sup>1, which further proves the excellent pseudo capacitive performance.

To compare the effect of surface morphology on the pseudo capacitance behavior, the GCD curves of all the control samples were measured (Figure 6d). Since the GCD discharge time under different reducing agents is much smaller than that of MnFe-PBA@IF, this is due to the reduction of the active surface area discussed earlier. On the other hand, the morphology of ZnFe-PBA@IF and FeFe-PBA@IF collapsed (the collapse degree of ZnFe-PBA@IF was smaller than that of FeFe-PBA@IF), which led to a significant reduction in the active area, and the discharge duration in GCD was longer than that of FeFe-PBA@IF. The above two comparison methods directly lead to a rapid

acceleration in the later stage of charging and the initial stage of discharge due to the degree of depression and collapse of the morphology, which directly affects the specific capacitance performance. Comparing the GCD curve of the IF without a long active site in Figure 6e, the discharge of MnFe-PBA@IF is much larger than that of IF, confirming the growth of the active site.

# **3. DFT Calculation of MnFe-PBA@IF**

In order to improve the experimental understanding of the active sites contributed by OER, we performed an in-depth analysis of the active surface and electronic structure of MnFe-PBA using density flooding theory (DFT). We have selected three active sites, Mn, Fe and C, on the original MnFe-PBA (1 0 1) surface model. the N site (3.04) and O site (3.44) are highly electronegative, so that the nitrogen atoms do not adsorb with oxygen-containing intermediates. So even if the oxygen-containing intermediate is placed on top of N, it will still be bounced off after geometric optimization. The geometrically optimized conformations of the three MnFe-PBA sites are shown in **Figure 7** and Figures S9 and S10, Supporting Information. They all adsorb and desorb \*OOH, \*OH and \*O, thus accelerating the conversion of the intermediates. The calculated Gibbs free energy diagrams for different active sites on the MnFe-PBA (1 0 1) plate for U = 0 V and U = 1.23 V are shown in **Figure 8**a,b. The maximum upslope energies for the Mn, Fe and C active sites are 1.835, 2.369, and 4.388 eV, respectively (Figure 8a), so the theoretical overpotentials for the three active sites are 0.605, 1.139 and 3.158 V (Figure 8b). In this case, the rate-determining step under the pristine MnFe-PBA (1 0 1) plate comes from the conversion from \*O to \*OOH, that is, the largest uphill step is caused by the formation of \*OOH.

Since the electronegativity of Mn (1.55) is lower than Fe's (1.83), partial traction and transfer of Mn to Fe occur, so Mn binds moderately strongly to the adsorbed oxygen-containing intermediates, thus probably due to better OER activity. The weaker binding of Mn and Fe to the adsorbed oxygen-containing intermediates leads to the generation of large overpotentials, most prominently for the \*OOH intermediates. Similarly, the most prominent C site is the \*intermediate. This can be derived from the binding Gibbs free energy exhibited in Table S1, Supporting Information (1.835 eV, 2.369 eV for Mn, Fe and 4.388 eV for the C site). That is, this Mn and Fe can readily adsorb \*O intermediates and have difficulty forming \*OOH. while C more readily adsorbs \*OOH and has difficulty forming \*.

The full density of the state's map of MnFe-PBA@IF was analyzed to understand the interlayer electron interactions, as shown in Figure 8c. We can see that the PDOS curve orbits are asymmetric, indicating that the sample is magnetic. More interestingly, it can be seen from some of the density of states plots (Figure 8d,e, Figure S11, Supporting Information) that the top of the valence band of MnFe-PBA is mainly contributed by the d orbitals of Mn and Fe and the bottom of the conduction band is mainly

contributed by the d orbitals of Mn. Meanwhile, Figure 8f shows the accumulation and consumption of electrons in MnFe-PBA during the adsorption of OOH\*. It can be seen that OOH\* gets a part of the charge on the Mn atom, which promotes the charge transfer and enhances the OER performance.

# **4. Conclusion**

Under the controlled room temperature, Fe-Mn Prussian blue squares have been grown on the IF surface and formed hexagonal depressions on the surface engineering by rapid reduction, which can accelerate the conversion of the material, increase the electrochemically active area and thus improve the catalytic performance of the OER. Furthermore, DFT calculations showed that the MnFe-PBA (1 0 1) activity was provided by the Mn site and the coordination of Fe, C and N sites synergistically optimized the electron distribution, thus enhancing the adsorption to the OER intermediates. The iron foam surface changes from a smooth to a nanoporous structure. The existing amorphous layers and porosity can improve the electron transport efficiency, promote redox kinetics, and intrinsically increase the negative voltage window, which simultaneously shows excellent pseudo-capacitive properties. The research can provide a good reference for the design of simple, low-cost, high-performance oxygen evolution reaction materials and supercapacitors. The active amorphous form of Prussian blue with high oxygen evolution reaction, which has a high adsorption capacity of CN with non-gold bonds and highly active metal centers and hexahedra, can be successfully synthesized at room temperature and meanwhile improve supercapacitor performance. Thus, Mn-Fe Prussian Blue with a highly active surface and excellent electrochemical performances can be used as a versatile energy storage and conversion electrode, which will greatly promote the progress of the electrochemical functional materials.

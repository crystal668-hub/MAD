Abstract: In spite of potential favorable electrochemical properties, reports of amorphous materials as catalysts for water oxidation are quite few. Highly efficient amorphous Ni¢Zn double hydroxide nanocages as electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) were prepared through a co-precipitate method. We investigated the influence of composition on electrocatalytic activity experimentally. Ni2.7Zn(OH)<sup>x</sup> turned out to be the optimal composition of these samples, which exhibited an OER onset overpotential as low as 0.20 V in 1m KOH electrolyte solution. In addition, Ni2.7Zn(OH)<sup>x</sup> could reach a current density of 10 A g<sup>1</sup> at an overpotential of approximately 0.20 V. Such high mass activity should take advantage of the unique amorphous hollow nanostructure of our sample, which can provide substantial exposure of surface active atoms for remarkable catalytic activity. This amorphous Ni¢Zn double hydroxide material was found to be a remarkable OER electrocatalyst and exhibited higher electrocatalytic activity than commercial IrO<sup>2</sup> .

As a promising way to generate clean renewable hydrogen energy, electrochemical water splitting has attracted research interest in energy conversion for decades.[1–5] However, oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode is kinetically sluggish because of multistep proton-coupled electron transfer, which may cause significant energy loss.[6] Therefore, efficient catalysts are required to reduce the onset overpotential and improve the energy conversion efficiency. Noble-metal-based catalysts such as IrO<sup>2</sup> and RuO<sup>2</sup> are considered as the most active

OER catalysts so far, [7] but they suffer from low natural earth storage and high cost, which limit their large-scale application. First-row transition metal oxides[8–10] and perovskites[11] have been widely studied to be efficient OER substitute catalysts. Particularly, Ni-containing oxides and hydroxides have attracted lots of attention because of their favorable catalytic ability. For instance, Ni0.9Fe0.1O<sup>x</sup> thin films exhibited more active OER catalytic performance than IrO<sup>x</sup> in basic media.[12] Dai and coworkers found that Ni–Fe layered double hydroxide–carbon nanotube complexes (NiFe-LDH/CNT) showed preferable OER catalytic activity than Ir/C in alkali solution.[13] Recently, reduced graphene oxide and FeNi layered double hydroxide hybrids (NiFe-rGO LDH) were confirmed to exhibit overpotentials as low as 0.195 V in OER catalysis by Yang and co-workers.[14] Furthermore, electrocatalytic activity can be significantly influenced by the composition of catalysts, as was verified by Jin et al. in the study of NixCo1-<sup>x</sup> (OH)<sup>2</sup> as an oxygen evolution/reduction reaction catalyst. [15] It is worth mentioning that though Ni-based materials have been widely researched as OER catalysts, there were no reports about Ni¢Zn double hydroxides as catalysts for water oxidation so far.

With specific atomic arrangements, amorphous materials are attracting research interest in electrochemical reactions because of their enhanced ionic conductivity and excellent performance in mechanics and catalysis.[16–18] However, reports of amorphous materials as catalysts for water oxidation are still few. Herein, amorphous Ni¢Zn double hydroxide nanocages with tunable compositions were synthesized via a co-precipitate method. To our knowledge, it is the first time that Ni¢Zn based double hydroxide was reported to be an efficient OER catalyst. The investigation of relationship between composition and electrocatalytic activity may give guidance for rational design of 3d-transition metal hydroxide-based OER catalysts. Ni2.7Zn(OH)<sup>x</sup> was found to be the optimal composition of the as prepared amorphous Ni¢Zn double hydroxides, comparable to the most active Ni-containing LDH catalysts reported to date. This, together with the superior stability of Ni2.7Zn(OH)<sup>x</sup> , make it a potential substitute catalyst for OER.

Amorphous Ni¢Zn double hydroxide nanocages were synthesized by a two-step method as shown in Figure 1. Cu2O nanocrystals with a lateral dimension of about 300 nm were prepared by our previously reported method with only changes on the reaction temperature and amount of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) (Supporting Information, Figure S1). Then, Ni2.7Zn(OH)<sup>x</sup> nanocages were synthesized by using the Cu2O

nanocrystals as sacrificial templates. With the addition of  $Na_2S_2O_3$  solution,  $Cu_2O$  templates gradually disappeared by forming a soluble  $[Cu_2(S_2O_3)_x]^{2-2x}$  coordination complex and produced  $OH^-$  on the reaction surface. On the other hand,  $OH^-$  can be also obtained from the hydrolysis of  $S_2O_3^{\,2-}$ . Meanwhile,  $Ni^{2+}$  and  $Zn^{2+}$  can co-precipitate on the reaction surface when the concentration of  $OH^-$  is high enough. With the dissolution of  $Cu_2O$  templates and formation of hydroxides, the amorphous double hydroxide nanocages, which can perfectly inherit the shape of  $Cu_2O$  templates, are finally achieved. [19-21] The reaction formulae are listed in Equations (1)–(3):

$$Cu_2O + x S_2O_3^{2-} + H_2O \rightarrow [Cu_2(S_2O_3)_x]^{2-2x} + 2OH^-$$

$$S_2O_3^{2-} + H_2O \rightarrow HS_2O_3^{-} + OH^{-}$$

$$x \operatorname{Ni}^{2+} + (1-x)\operatorname{Zn}^{2+} + 2 \operatorname{OH}^{-} \to \operatorname{Ni}_{x}\operatorname{Zn}_{1-x}(\operatorname{OH})_{2}$$

Scanning electron microscope (SEM) observation (Figure 2a) revealed that the Ni-Zn double hydroxide nanocages formed uniform polyhedron hollow structures. The surface structure and the inner cavity can be clearly distinguished by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images. As shown in Figure 2b, these nanocages perfectly inherited the shape and dimension of the Cu<sub>2</sub>O templates with a shell thickness of several tens of nanometers and lateral dimensions of about 300 nm. It is obvious that with a typical two-dimensional (2D) structure, the specific sheetlike secondary structure on the surface are beneficial to the increase of specific surface area. [21] Selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern in the inset of Figure 2b indicates the amorphous feature of the Ni-Zn double hydroxide, coincident with the X-ray diffraction (XRD) result (Supporting Information, Figure S2). These structural characteristic can be very advantageous to the exposure of active sites on the surface, thus leading to improvement of catalytic performance.

Compositions of the as-prepared double hydroxide nanocages were analyzed by energy disperse spectroscopy (EDS) (Figure 2 c); the atomic ratio of Ni to Zn turned out to be 2.7:1, close to the initial molar radio of NiCl<sub>2</sub> and ZnCl<sub>2</sub>, confirming the co-precipitation of Ni<sup>2+</sup> and Zn<sup>2+</sup>. In the Ni 2p X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) survey spectrum (Figure 2 d), the main peak of  $2p_{3/2}$  located at 855.3 eV is a characteristic peak of Ni<sup>2+</sup>, the spin-orbit splitting value of  $2p_{1/2}$  and  $2p_{3/2}$  is 17.6 eV, further showing the Ni<sup>2+</sup> constituent. [22] In the Zn 2p

XPS survey spectrum (Figure 2 e), the main peak of  $2p_{3/2}$  located at 1021.2 eV is a characteristic peak of  $Zn^{2+}$  and the spin-orbit splitting value of  $2p_{1/2}$  and  $2p_{3/2}$  is 23.0 eV, further showing the  $Zn^{2+}$  constituent.<sup>[23]</sup> As for the O 1s XPS survey spectrum (Figure 2 f), the main peak at 531.0 eV can illustrate the divalent state of O, which shows the existence of "OH-".<sup>[22]</sup> Hence, it can be concluded that the sample is Ni–Zn double hydroxide with a composition of Ni<sub>27</sub>Zn(OH)<sub>x</sub>.

The X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) can help to further investigate the oxidation state and local symmetry of central ions. As was displayed in the X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectrum of the samples (Figure 3 a and 3 b), Ni K-edge absorption edge positions of as prepared nanocages coincide with that of commercial crystalline Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>, further il-

of the central atom in amorphous material, thus supporting the accession of Zn in the co-precipitate process. It is worth mentioning that there is no pre-edge peak signal in the XANES spectrum of Zn K-edge in Figure 3b, which is due to the full electronic state of 3d orbit in Zn<sup>2+</sup>. As can be seen from Figure 3b, the main peak and multiple-scattering peak of as-prepared Ni<sub>2.7</sub>Zn(OH)<sub>x</sub> nanocages broaden significantly compared to commercial crystalline Zn(OH)<sub>2</sub>, certifying its amorphous characteristic and illustrating the higher degree of structural distortion of Ni<sub>2.7</sub>Zn(OH)<sub>x</sub> nanocages because of the accession of Ni ions in the co-precipitation process.

The extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra of the materials are shown in Figure 3 c and 3 d. It is remarkable that the amplitude of as-prepared nanomaterials decreas-

es significantly compared to the commercial crystalline materials especially in the Zn K-edge EXAFS spectrum. This result demonstrates the decrease of coordination number in the Ni-O, Ni-Ni and Zn-O, Zn-Zn coordination sphere. For further validation, the fitting curve of Ni K-**EXAFS** spectrum edae Ni<sub>2.7</sub>Zn(OH)<sub>x</sub> and commercial crystalline Ni(OH)2 are displayed in Figure S7. As can be seen from Table S1, the Ni-Ni coordination number of Ni<sub>2.7</sub>Zn(OH)<sub>x</sub> nanocages is significantly reduced compared to that of crystalline Ni(OH)2 while the Debye-Waller factor clearly increased, indicating the amorphous feature of the as-prepared nanocages. Such characteristics may be beneficial in catalytic system. The Ni-O and Ni-Ni bond distance of Ni<sub>2.7</sub>Zn(OH)<sub>x</sub> nanocages are smaller than that of crystalline Ni(OH)2, which may due to the deformation of Ni-O<sub>6</sub> octahedral coordination in amorphous material.

The electrocatalytic properties of the Ni<sub>2.7</sub>Zn(OH)<sub>x</sub> double hydroxide nanocages with respect to oxygen evolution reaction (OER) were investigated by using a standard three-electrode system in 1 m KOH solution. The glassy carbon electrode modified with as-prepared sample was used as the working electrode. For comparison, four other materials, NiZn(OH)<sub>x</sub>, NiZn<sub>2</sub>(OH)<sub>x</sub>, Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>, and Zn(OH)<sub>2</sub>, were synthesized for investigating the influence of composition on the catalytic performance. It should be noted that all five kinds of hydroxide nanocages were prepared using the same method. Therefore, they have consistent shape and horizontal size, only with differences between their compositions (Figure S3–S6). Electrocatalytic activities of all samples were measured under

lustrating the divalent oxidation state of Ni in the samples. The Zn K-edge absorption edge positions of as prepared nanocages are similar to that of commercial crystalline Zn(OH)<sub>2</sub>, further illustrating the divalent oxidation state of Zn in the samples. There are three obvious peak positions in Figure 3a: the preedge peak, the main peak and the multiple-scattering peak. The small pre-edge peak corresponds to the transition of 1s electrons to 3d final states, which is a typical characteristic peak of transition metal materials. The main peak was assigned as the dipole-allowed 1s to 4p final states electronic transition in transition metal materials.<sup>[24]</sup> The shift of the multiple-scattering peak can be ascribed to the local environment change

the same conditions and ensuring the weight of samples loaded on the electrode (0.05 mgcm¢<sup>2</sup> ) was uniform in each case.

The IR-corrected linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curve of the Ni2.7Zn(OH)<sup>x</sup> double hydroxide sample in Figure 4 a showed a sharp onset at potential of 1.43 V versus the reversible hydrogen electron (RHE), indicating the start of electrocatalysis for water oxidation at the overpotential of around 0.20 V, which is as low as the most effective Ni-based catalyst reported so far. [14] Meanwhile, OER onset potential of NiZn(OH)<sup>x</sup> is also very impressive, which is 1.45 V. Onset potentials for Ni(OH)<sup>2</sup> and NiZn<sup>2</sup> (OH)<sup>x</sup> are very close to each other, with values of 1.49 and 1.50 V, respectively. Nevertheless, significant differences can be seen from the current density of these two samples at high potential. The Zn(OH)<sup>2</sup> sample showed a significant positive onset potential of about 1.55 V, which is the highest one among the five samples, showing that Zn is a relatively inactive component in the catalyst. It is noteworthy that even the relatively poor Zn(OH)<sup>2</sup> sample showed more preferable catalytic performance than commercial IrO<sup>2</sup> (Supporting Information, Figure S8), indicating superior OER performance of as-prepared amorphous nanocage samples. In addition, the potential required to reachacurrent density of 10 mAcm¢<sup>2</sup> is another important indicator to evaluate the OER activity of catalysts.[25] Herein, the potentials of the five samples at 10 mAcm¢<sup>2</sup> were 0.29 V for Ni2.7Zn(OH)<sup>x</sup> , which is 0.03, 0.10, 0.13, and 0.19 V less than NiZn(OH)<sup>x</sup> , Ni(OH)<sup>2</sup> , NiZn<sup>2</sup> (OH)<sup>x</sup> , and Zn(OH)<sup>2</sup> , respectively. Hence, we can conclude that Ni2.7Zn(OH)<sup>x</sup> has the best electrocatalytic performance. Electrocatalytic activity of the other four materials are in the order of NiZn(OH)x> Ni(OH)2>NiZn<sup>2</sup> (OH)x>Zn(OH)<sup>2</sup> .

As displayed in Figure 4 b, Ni2.7Zn(OH)<sup>x</sup> obtained the highest current density under a certain potential, for example, 1.60 V versus RHE. It is clear that the current density increased from 1.54 to 56.8 mAcm¢<sup>2</sup> with the percentage of Ni in the samples ranging from 0–73%. Nevertheless, when the percentage of Ni further reached to 100%, namely Ni(OH)<sup>2</sup> , the current density decreased deeply to 6.2 mAcm¢<sup>2</sup> . It is clearly shown in Figure 4 c that Ni2.7Zn(OH)<sup>x</sup> exhibited the optimal onset overpotential with respect to OER, and could attain a current density of 10 mAcm¢<sup>2</sup> at relatively lower overpotentials compared to Ni(OH)<sup>2</sup> , NiZn(OH)<sup>x</sup> , NiZn<sup>2</sup> (OH)<sup>x</sup> , and Zn(OH)<sup>2</sup> . Since these five samples had similar size and structure, we can conclude that the difference of their electrocatalytic activities should stem from their compositions. In addition to this, we should note that Zn(OH)<sup>2</sup> revealed the weakest electrocatalytic ability, suggesting that Ni is mainly responsible for the OER catalytic performance of Ni¢Zn double hydroxide. However, the existence of Zn plays an important role in promoting the catalytic performance by forming bimetallic synergistic catalytic sites. This conclusion is similar with a recent work by Zou and co-workers, in which Zn<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> in the Co-based LDH providing cooperative effects in promoting the electrocatalytic activity by assisting the reaction species in approaching the Co active sites.[8] Moreover, this finding also verified our previous conclusion that the adding of Zn may change the local environment of active Ni sites and lead to enhancement of binding with O\*, thus resulting in improvement of OER activity.

Tafel plots of the as-prepared samples were recorded by fitting the liner region in Figure 4d, which can reflect the kinetic parameters of OER. The Tafel slope of Ni<sub>2.7</sub>Zn(OH)<sub>x</sub> is as low as 43 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>, which is superior to the common OER catalyst IrO2 66 mV dec<sup>-1</sup> (Supporting Information, Figure S9), and comparable to that of the reported wellperforming Ni-containing OER catalysts NiFe-LDH/rGO  $(39 \text{ mV dec}^{-1})$  and SL  $Ni(OH)_2$  $(47 \text{ mV dec}^{-1}).^{[14,15]}$ Remarkably,

(a) EIS of as-prepared catalysts with different molar ratios of Ni and Zn tested in 1  $\upmma$  KOH electrolyte at an overpotential of 0.20 V; (b) EIS of Ni<sub>2.7</sub>Zn(OH)<sub>x</sub> in the high-frequency region and the equivalent circuit used for the fitting of charge transfer resistance.

the Tafel slope of  $Ni_{2,7}Zn(OH)_x$  is also much smaller than that of  $NiZn(OH)_x$  (51 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>),  $Ni(OH)_2$  (69 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>),  $NiZn_2(OH)_x$  (77 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>), and  $Zn(OH)_2$  (79 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>).

For further research on the catalytic activity of  $Ni_{2.7}Zn(OH)_x$  amorphous nanocages, we calculated the turnover frequency (TOF) of the sample at an overpotential of 0.3 V in 1 M KOH solution, which turns out to be as high as  $0.16 \, s^{-1}$ . This is a conservative estimate since the value is recorded assuming that all the metal ions in the sample are catalytically active. Notably, the TOF of  $Ni_{2.7}Zn(OH)_x$  is overwhelmingly higher than the recently reported crystalline Ni-contained double hydroxide catalyst  $Ni_{0.55}Co_{0.45}(OH)_2$  (0.014 s<sup>-1</sup>) and Zn-contained double hydroxide catalyst ZnCo-LDH-100 (0.02 s<sup>-1</sup>) at the same overpotential of 0.3 V. Meanwhile, the TOF of  $Ni_{2.7}Zn(OH)_x$  catalyst can reach a remarkable value of 0.47 s<sup>-1</sup> at an overpotential of 0.35 V, indicating the excellent OER performance of our sample.

Moreover, mass activity of our prepared Ni<sub>2.7</sub>Zn(OH)<sub>x</sub> amorphous nanocages is quite impressive. The value was calculated using the formula: mass activity = i/c, while i is the current density at a given overpotential, c is the concentration of catalysts that were modified on the glassy carbon electrode (Supporting Information, Figure S11). It turned out that the mass activity is 285.6 Ag<sup>-1</sup> at an overpotential of 0.3 V in 1 м КОН electrolyte solution and the overpotential is 0.202 V to reach a current density of 10 Ag<sup>-1</sup>. Such high mass activity originated from two aspects: one is their unique hollow nanostructure, making them astonishingly light and leading to large specific surface area, which is advantageous compared to traditional solid catalysts; the other is inherent amorphous characteristic of our sample. As was previously reported, amorphous substances contain lots of atoms on the surface which are coordination unsaturated. These defects can supply active sites for excellent catalytic activity. [27] The superior mass activity may be beneficial for future application in electric catalytic systems.

For further investigation of the electron-transport properties of the prepared materials, electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were measured at 0.45 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) in 1 M KOH electrolyte. From EIS comparison in Figure 5 a, the radius of the impedance spectra of the five samples are in the order of  $Ni_{2.7}Zn(OH)_x < NiZn(OH)_x < Ni(OH)_2 < NiZn_2(OH)_x < Zn(OH)_2$ , indicating much smaller charge transfer resistance of  $Ni_{2.7}Zn(OH)_y$ ,

thus resulting in the enhancement of electrochemical activity. Zview software was used for the fitting of resistance values. As was shown in Figure 5 b, the equivalent circuit contains three parts: the solution resistance  $R_{\rm s}$ , the charge transfer resistance  $R_{\rm ct}$  and the constant phase resistance  $R_{\rm cp}$ . The fitting value of Ni<sub>2.7</sub>Zn(OH)<sub>x</sub> is 14.24 ohm, while the values of NiZn(OH)<sub>x</sub>, NiZn<sub>2</sub>(OH)<sub>x</sub> and Zn(OH)<sub>2</sub> are 14.8, 30.21, 39.36, and 61.33 ohm, respectively, in the same order as the electrocatalytic activity of the five samples.

The stability of our prepared  $Ni_{2.7}Zn(OH)_x$  amorphous nanocages were carried out by a chronopotentiometry measurement. Figure 4e revealed that  $Ni_{2.7}Zn(OH)_x$  catalyst can maintain a potential of about 1.51 V at current density of  $10~\text{mA}~\text{cm}^{-2}$  in 1~m KOH electrolyte solution with negligible change for 10~h. In addition to this, the LSV curve after CP measurement for 10~h nearly completely coincides with the initial curve (Figure 4 f). The strong durability is due to the mechanical stability caused by the special hollow and amorphous structures of the catalyst.  $^{[19]}$ 

In summary, we prepared a series of amorphous Ni-Zn double hydroxide nanocages with tunable composition via a co-precipitation process. Subsequently catalytic performance research gave a piece of evidence that OER activity can be significantly influenced by the composition of the catalysts. It can be concluded that Ni<sub>2.7</sub>Zn(OH)<sub>x</sub> is an optimal composition among these catalysts, which exhibits excellent OER catalytic activity with an onset overpotential as low as 0.20 V and Tafel slope of  $43 \, \mathrm{mV} \, \mathrm{dec}^{-1}$ , comparable to that of the currently reported most active Ni-containing catalysts. In addition, Ni<sub>2.7</sub>Zn(OH), displayed superior mass activity with an overpotential of 0.20 V to reach a current density of 10 Ag<sup>-1</sup> in 1 M KOH. Such high mass activity may result from their unique hollow structure, making them astonishingly light and leading to substantial exposure of surface active atoms to enhance the catalytic property. It is noteworthy that the presence of Zn in the products can significantly improve the catalytic property by taking advantage of bimetal coordination effect. The coprecipitate method we presented here could be expanded to other transition metals and the catalytic performance could be further improved by forming composites with electroconductive carbon materials.

## **Experimental Section**

#### Preparation of Cu<sub>2</sub>O nanocrystals

The synthesis method follows our previous report<sup>[28]</sup> with some modifications of reaction temperature and amount of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP, MW30000). First, 0.171 g CuCl<sub>2</sub>·2 H<sub>2</sub>O and 0.900 g PVP were dissolved in 100 mL deionized water and heated to 40 °C, then NaOH solution (1 м 10 mL) was added into it. The color of the mixture quickly changed from blue to dark sepia. After stirring for 30 min, 10 mL of ascorbic acid solution (2 м) was added dropwise into the mixture solution. Then the mixture was kept at 40 °C with magnetic stirring for 3 h with its color gradually changed from dark sepia to orange red. The precipitate was collected by centrifugation and washed by deionized water and ethanol twice, respectively, and finally dried at 60 °C in vacuum for 10 h.

0.005 g Cu<sub>2</sub>O with 0.333 g PVP and set amounts of NiCl<sub>2</sub>·6H<sub>2</sub>O and ZnCl<sub>2</sub> were dissolved in a mixed solution of 5 mL deionized water and 5 mL ethanol. The molar ratio of NiCl<sub>2</sub>·6H<sub>2</sub>O and ZnCl<sub>2</sub> in preparing Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>, Ni<sub>2</sub>,Zn(OH)<sub>x</sub>, NiZn(OH)<sub>x</sub>, NiZn<sub>2</sub>(OH)<sub>x</sub> and Zn(OH)<sub>2</sub> was 10:0, 7:3, 1:1, 1:2 and 0:10 respectively. The total number of moles of NiCl<sub>2</sub>·6H<sub>2</sub>O and ZnCl<sub>2</sub> was  $7.1 \times 10^{-6}$ . Then the mixture was kept at 30 °C with magnetic stirring for 30 min. 4 mL Na<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> solution (1 m) was added dropwise to the mixture. The hydroxide precipitate was obtained in about 10 min and washed by deionized water and ethanol several times.

#### Sample preparation for electrochemical characterization

2.94 mg of as-prepared catalyst was dispersed in 700  $\mu$ L deionized water, 292  $\mu$ L ethanol and 8  $\mu$ L of 5 wt% nafion solution by sonication. Then 3.3  $\mu$ L of the catalyst ink was loaded onto a glassy carbon electrode with a diameter of 5 mm (loading 0.05 mg cm<sup>-2</sup>).

#### Characterization

Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images were taken with a field-emission environmental scanning electron microscope Quanta 250 FEG. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were taken by a JEOL JEM-2100F microscope. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) of samples were recorded on a Thermo Scientific ES-CALAB 250 Xi XPS system at a pressure of about  $1.5 \times 10^{-9}$  mbar using  $Al_{K\alpha}$  X-ray as the excitation source (1486.6 eV) and the size of X-ray spot was 500 µm. The shifts of all binding energies were calibrated using C1s binding energy at 284.8 eV. X-ray absorption spectra (XAS) were collected at the 1W1B beamline at the Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility, with the electron energy of 2.5 GeV and electric current between 160 and 250 mA. The signals were collected by transmission mode. XANES spectra were analyzed by Athena module from ifeffit 1.2.11 and estimations of the structural parameters and the Debye–Waller factor ( $\sigma^2$ ) were analyzed by Artemis module.

#### **Electrochemical measurements**

2.94 mg of as-prepared catalyst was dispersed in 700  $\mu$ L deionized water, 292  $\mu$ L ethanol and 8  $\mu$ L of 5 wt% nafion solution by sonication. Then 3.3  $\mu$ L of the catalyst ink was loaded onto a glassy carbon electrode with diameter of 5 mm (loading 0.05 mg cm<sup>-2</sup>). Electrocatalytic properties of the double hydroxides for oxygen

evolution reaction were carried out in a typical three electrode system controlled by a PINE Instruments electrochemistry workstation in 1  $\rm M$  KOH. The glassy carbon electrode loaded with the as prepared material was used as the working electrode. Pt wire and Ag/AgCl electrode were used as counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively. The IR-corrected liner sweep voltammetry polarization curves and chronopotentiometry curve were recorded at 5  $\rm mV\,s^{-1}$  while the Tafel curves were recorded at 0.1  $\rm mV\,s^{-1}$ . Before testing, N<sub>2</sub> was used to remove the O<sub>2</sub> in the electrolyte solution. During measurements, the working electrode was continuously rotating at 1600 rpm to get rid of the produced oxygen bubbles.

#### Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS)

The EIS measurements were carried out at overpotential of 0.20 V in 1  $\rm M$  KOH electrolyte with an AC amplitude of 10 mV. The impedance spectra were recorded in a frequency range of 100 kHz to 0.01 Hz. Before testing, the KOH solution was bubbled with  $N_2$  at a flow rate of 25 mL min $^{-1}$  for 30 min. Before recording each impedance spectrum, the electrode was firstly equilibrated at the fixed potential for 120 s. The experimental impedance data were fitted to an appropriate equivalent circuit using Zview software to obtain the resistance values.

#### **RHE** calibration

We used a Ag/AgCl electrode as reference electrode in the electrocatalytic measurement, all the potentials shown in our tests were calibrated and transformed to reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). The calibration was carried out in 1 m and 0.1 m KOH solution, respectively (Figure 6). Before calibration, the solution was bubbled

**Figure 6.** Electrode calibration with (a) 1 M and (b) 0.1 M KOH solution. In 1 M KOH, E (RHE) = E (Ag/AgCl) + 0.983 V. In 0.1 M KOH, E (RHE) = E (Ag/AgCl) + 0.923 V.

with hydrogen for 0.5 h to get a hydrogen saturated electrolyte. Pt wire was used as the working electrode. CVs were recorded at a scan rate of 2 mVs<sup>-1</sup>, the average of the two potentials at which the current crossed zero was taken to be the thermodynamic potential for the hydrogen electrode reactions.

## Turnover frequency (TOF) calculations

The TOF values were calculated based on the formula TOF=jA/4Fn. Where j is the current density at overpotential of 0.3 V, A is the area of glassy carbon electrode, 4 is the mole of electrons transferred to generate one mole of  $O_{2r}$ , F is the Faraday constant (valued at 96 485 C mol<sup>-1</sup>), and n is the number of moles of active metal sites.

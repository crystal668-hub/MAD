# **Theoretically Insight into Co and S Pairs Dispersed on N-Doped Graphene: Promising Bifunctional Electrocatalysts for Oxygen Reduction/Evolution Reactions**

*Ji Zhang, Aimin Yu, Dongsheng Li, and Chenghua Sun\**

**Single atom catalysts (SACs) are considered as efficient catalysts for hydrogen-based energy conversion and storage because of their excellent catalytic performance for oxygen evolution reactions (OER) and oxygen reduction reactions (ORR). In the present work, a new concept of SACs is proposed with the capacity to form** *d***-***p* **orbital hybridization. These computationally designed SACs contain a metal and non-metal pair embedded in the N-doped graphene framework (MX@N6). Based on the overpotential evaluation by the first principle theory calculations, CoS@N6 containing Co and S atom pair possessed a low overpotential of 0.37 V/0.29 V when used as a bifunctional ORR/OER catalyst. These overpotentials are much lower than Co@N6 without S atom. The electronic structure analysis revealed that non-metal atoms of the catalyst can regulate the electronic structure of active metal sites and facilitate the adsorption and charge transfer between intermediates and the catalyst resulting in enhanced catalytic performance. This work demonstrates an alternative way to further improve the catalytic activity of SACs by introducing a non-metal atom that may shed light on the rational design of advanced SACs for ORR/OER with high efficiency and stability.**

# **1. Introduction**

Hydrogen-based energy conversion and storage are crucial technologies for dealing with environmental pollution and the shortage of energy resources due to the excessive consumption of fossil fuels. The oxygen reduction/evolution reaction (ORR/OER) are important reaction in technologies of hydrogen fuel cells[\[1,2\]](#page-6-0) and water decomposition.[\[3,4\]](#page-6-0) However, because these reactions suffer from slow kinetics, the exploration of highly efficient catalysts for the ORR and OER to enhance energy conversion efficiency is needed. Currently, precious noble metals are typically employed as commercial catalysts; however, these metals face wide application limitations owing to their high costs.[\[5,6\]](#page-6-0) Therefore, significant efforts have been made in the development of highly active, stable, and low-cost ORR/OER catalysts.

Recently, single-atom catalysts (SACs), consisting of a single atom as an active

site, have attracted considerable research attention because of their high atom utilization and outstanding activities.[\[7\]](#page-6-0) Among them, Fe, Co, and Ni are typically selected as active elements because of their specific electronic structures and low prices.[\[8,9\]](#page-6-0) In a previous study, single-atom Co was embedded in N-doped graphene to form CoN2 and CoN4 sites for ORR with high stability.[\[10\]](#page-6-0) However, CoN2 and CoN4 catalysts prefer to form hydrogen peroxide (HOOH) via a two-electron ORR process, which is disadvantageous for fuel cells. A ZnCoN6 catalyst was created by Lu[\[11\]](#page-6-0) with Zn and Co atom pairs anchored on N-doped graphene, and improved ORR activity compared with CoN4 was achieved. This improvement is related to regulating the electronics of the Co sites by the accompanying metal atoms. Subsequently, the FeCoN6 sites designed by Sun[\[12\]](#page-6-0) exhibited bifunctional electrocatalytic performance for the ORR/OER, which was ascribed to the magnetic adjustment of Fe atoms. Similarly, Hunter[\[13\]](#page-6-0) reported that the overpotential of the oxygen reaction decreased on the TMCoN8 (TM = Pt, Ni, Co) system due to the addition of another metal atom. Previous studies have suggested that the modulation of the local properties of the active site by another metal atom is the main reason for the enhancement of the catalysts. Although transition metals play an important role in improving catalytic performance, the catalytic properties of <span id="page-1-0"></span>these catalysts are also influenced by their non-metal coordination environment.<sup>[14]</sup> Therefore, non-metal atoms, such as B, O, S, and P, are possible to act as coordinating atoms to enhance the catalytic activity by regulating the energy band structure of the catalysts.

In this study, SACs with non-metal coordination were computationally investigated. These SACs have a transition metal atom and non-metal atom anchored on N-doped graphene for ORR and OER. This design focused primarily on Fe, Co, and Ni, which have been demonstrated to possess excellent ORR/OER activities. [15–20] Four non-metals, B, O, S, and P, were selected to form 12 SACs with the formula  $MX@N_6$  (M = Ni, Co, and Fe; X = P, S, O, and B). The influence of non-mental on the catalytic performance of  $MX@N_6$  was studied in detail.

## 2. Computational Details

All the calculations were implemented by the Vienna ab initio simulation package code on the basis of the density functional theory (DFT).[21] The computations were performed by the spin-polarized general gradient approximation for the electronic exchange-correlation energy.[22] The electron-ion interactions can be calculated by a projector-augmented wave method and the cutoff energy of the plane wave was 450 eV.[23] The structural optimization and electronic states were calculated using  $3 \times 3 \times 1$  and  $4 \times 4 \times 1$ k-points for the Monkhorst-Pack grid, respectively. The structural optimizations were performed using  $1 \times 10^{-5}$  eV as energy convergence and 0.02 eV Å<sup>-1</sup> as the maximum force. Atomic charge and charge transfer were estimated using Bader charge analysis.[24] The DFT-D3 method was used to deal with van der Waals (vdW) interactions.<sup>[25]</sup> The Lobster code was used to compute the projected crystal orbital Hamilton population (pCOHP) for the bonding strength of the key atom

The Gibbs free energy changes of reaction,  $\Delta G$ , was calculated by the equation of

$$\Delta G = \Delta E + \Delta Z P E - T \Delta S + \Delta G_u + \Delta G_{nH}$$
 (1)

in which  $\Delta E$  is the change of the energy of the system calculated by DFT;  $\Delta ZPE$  and  $T\Delta S$  are the energy changes related to the zero-point vibration and the entropy of the reactants and products; and  $\Delta G$ u stands for the effect of electrode potential. Note that  $\Delta G_{\rm pH}$  equal to  $k_{\rm B}T \times \ln 10 \times \rm pH$  (pH 0 for the acid medium), where  $k_{\rm B}$  is the Boltzmann constant. In the ORR/OER process, the standard hydrogen electrode was used as the referenced electrode on the basis of the computational hydrogen electrode model,  $^{[29]}$  where the free energy of proton/electron pair took the place of the chemical potential of  $^{1/2}H_2$  in the equilibrium state.

In this work, metal and non-metal atom pairs were trapped into a pore of  $5 \times 5$  supercell graphene containing six pyridinic N atoms to form MX@N<sub>6</sub> structures (M = Fe, Co, Ni; X = B, O, S, P), as shown in **Figure 1**. The vacuum layer with 20 Å thick was used to weaken the interaction between two adjacent slabs. The formation energy is expressed as below:

$$E_f = E_{MX+Gra} + 10\mu_C - (E_{Gra} + 6\mu_N + \mu_M + \mu_X)$$
 (2)

**Figure 1.** Model structures of the MX $@N_6$  catalysts and configurations of adsorbed intermediates at the catalyst surface.

where  $E_{MX+Gra}$  is the energy of the slab;  $E_{Gra}$  denotes the energy of the pure graphene;  $\mu_C$  and  $\mu N$  are the chemical potentials of carbon atom in the pristine graphene and N atom in nitrogen gas, respectively; and  $\mu_M$  and  $\mu_X$  are the energy of single metal and non-metal atoms, respectively. Thus, the negative formation energy means a stable structure.

The entire ORR process is followed by the 4 e<sup>-</sup> ORR process:

\* 
$$+ O_2 + H^+ + e^- \rightarrow *OOH$$
 (3)

$$^{*}OOH + H^{+} + e^{-} \rightarrow ^{*}O + H_{2}O$$
 (4)

$$^{*}O + H^{+} + e^{-} \rightarrow ^{*}OH$$
 (5)

$$^{*}OH + H^{+} + e^{-} \rightarrow ^{*} + H_{2}O$$
 (6)

While the OER is described by the reverse process of the ORR The Gibbs free energy changes of each ORR step were calculated by Equations (7)–(10), as follows.

$$\Delta G_1 = 4.92 - \Delta G_{*OOH} \tag{7}$$

$$\Delta G_2 = \Delta G_{*OOH} - \Delta G_{*O} \tag{8}$$

$$\Delta G_3 = \Delta G_{*O} - \Delta G_{*OH} \tag{9}$$

$$\Delta G_4 = \Delta G_{*OH} \tag{10}$$

Thus, catalytic efficiency was gauged by the overpotential,  $\eta^{\rm OER}$ , and  $\eta^{\rm ORR}$ , obtained by:

$$\eta^{OER} = \max \{ \Delta G_1, \Delta G_2, \Delta G_3, \Delta G_4 \} / e - 1.23V$$
(11)

$$\eta^{ORR} = 1.23 \text{V} - \min \left\{ \Delta G_1, \Delta G_2, \Delta G_3, \Delta G_4 \right\} / e \tag{12}$$

Figure 2. Formation energies of  $MX@N_6$  and  $M@N_6$  catalysts.

The overpotential of Pt (111) is 0.45 V for ORR,<sup>[30]</sup> which was used as a reference to select the promising candidates because it has a similar catalytic performance to the Pt/C catalyst.

#### 3. Results and Discussion

#### 3.1. Structure and Stability of MX@N<sub>6</sub>

Figure 1 schematically illustrates the structure of MX@N $_6$  consisting of metal and non-metal atom pairs (M = Fe, Co, Ni; X = B, O, S, P). The stabilities of MX@N $_6$  catalysts were evaluated according to Equation (2), and the results are shown in **Figure 2**. Evidently, the formation energies of all MX@N $_6$  catalysts were negative, suggesting that they are thermodynamically stable; in particular, B-based catalysts, including FeB, CoB, and NiB, were the most stable. Among them, the formation energy of the NiB catalyst is -7.67 eV, exhibiting the highest stability followed by CoB and FeB, with formation energies of -7.63 and -6.95 eV, respectively. Compared to the formation energy of M@N $_6$  catalysts with only metal atoms, the inclusion of non-metal species significantly enhances the stability of MX@N $_6$ .

#### 3.2. Catalytic Performance

Overpotentials of ORR and OER are an important index to evaluate catalytic performance. The lower the overpotential for OER, the lower the energy consumption, thus a better catalytic performance. Overpotentials are generally determined by the potential determining steps (PDS), under which all the reaction steps occur spontaneously. The free energy profiles of the reaction can display the genetic details of ORR/OER. **Figure 3** illustrates the energy profiles for CoX@N<sub>6</sub>, FeX@N<sub>6</sub>, and NiX@N<sub>6</sub> catalysts, and the corresponding Co@N<sub>6</sub>, Fe@N<sub>6</sub>, and Ni@N<sub>6</sub>, respectively, at  $U_0 = 1.23$  V. The energy profiles were drawn based on the illustrative mechanisms shown in Figure 1, in which the free energy of each intermediate state is demonstrated from O<sub>2</sub> to H<sub>2</sub>O for ORR, and the opposite direction for OER. In Figure 3, PDS exhibited the largest free energy changes. Evidently, the PDS for ORR (Figure 3a) were all related to the first hydrogenation

**Figure 3.** Energy profile of the reaction on Co-based a), Fe-based b), and Ni-based c) catalysts.

step ( $O_2 \rightarrow^* OOH$ ) in the order of Co > CoO > CoP > CoB > CoS. Moreover, Ni-based SACs also present the same trend (Ni > NiP > NiO > NiB > NiS) as Co-based SACs. This suggests that the addition of non-metals strengthens the binding to \*OOH intermediate, thereby improving the activity. However, for Febased SACs (Figure 3b), the fourth steps (\*OH $\rightarrow$ H<sub>2</sub>O) as PDS in order of FeP > FeS > FeB > FeO > Fe play a vital role in the overpotential. This implies that the addition of non-metal atoms strengthens the adsorption of OH intermediate but weak-

ens the activity of ORR. Fortunately, FeO (PDS = 0.38 eV) exhibited almost the same catalytic performance as Fe (PDS = 0.37 eV) SAC but with better stability. Regarding the PDS for OER, the PDS of Co- and Fe-based SACs were observed in the third step (\*O $\rightarrow$ \*OOH), except for FeP (\*OOH $\rightarrow$ O<sub>2</sub>) and CoO (\*OH $\rightarrow$ \*O). However, in the case of NiX@ $N_6$ , the PDS occur in the second step (\*OH $\rightarrow$ \*O) except for NiS (H<sub>2</sub>O $\rightarrow$ \*OH). By comparison, the CoS exhibits the best OER properties with a PDF of 0.29 eV. It is worth mentioning that an unconventional mechanism for OER was reported recently by Barlocco, [31] in which the OER undergoes the  $H_2O \rightarrow^*OH \rightarrow^*OH^*OH \rightarrow^*OH^*O \rightarrow O_2$  pathway with two OH intermediates adsorbed simultaneously on the active site in the second step. In the present work, this possible process was also considered for the CoS catalyst. The energy profile of the reaction on CoS was calculated and illustrated in Figure S2 (Supporting Information). It is found that the PDS occur in the \*OH $\rightarrow$ \*OH\*OH step with the value of 1.06 eV when the OER reacts along the unconventional route, meaning that the OER on  $CoS@N_6$  prefers to the  $H_2O \rightarrow^*OH \rightarrow^*O \rightarrow^*OOH \rightarrow O_2$  pathway. Though the PDS depends on the relative strength of the intermediates binding to the surface of SACs, the adsorption strength of O, OH, and OOH was found to have a linear relationship, as discussed in Section 3.3.

In this study, the overpotentials for ORR/OER of MX@N<sub>6</sub> were calculated using Equations (11) and (12), and illustrated in Figure 4. Evidently, Co-based catalysts exhibited better activity for either ORR or OER compared with Fe- and Ni-based catalysts. Among them, the best catalyst was CoS, with an overpotential of 0.37/0.29 V for ORR/OER, respectively; thus, it is a bifunctional catalyst. The next best catalysts are FeO and CoB, with overpotentials of 0.38 and 0.41 V for ORR, respectively. Evidently, all of them were better than that of OER-ideal IrO<sub>2</sub> (0.55 V)/ORR-ideal Pt (111) (0.45 V). It is noted that the overpotentials of CoS for ORR/OER are much lower than other catalysts previously studied, including CoN<sub>4</sub>-gra (0.69/0.47 V), [32] Rh- $C_2N_2$  (0.44/0.52 V), [33] AuCo/g-CN (0.52/0.48 V), [34] Ni@Pentabelt (0.72 V for OER)[35] thus rendering it as a promising bifunctional catalyst. Furthermore, the overpotential of Co@N6 with a single Co atom embedded in N-doped graphene was calcu-

lated. Evidently, it exhibited the overpotentials of 0.57/0.54 V for ORR/OER, thus implying that the addition of an S atom significantly strengthens the activity of the Co site.

#### 3.3. Scaling Relationships among Oxygenated Intermediates

According to the above discussion, the overpotentials of MX@N6 catalysts are determined by the binding strength of intermediates OH, O, and OOH to the catalyst. Subsequently, the scaling relationships of the adsorption-free energy for these intermediates were defined to gauge the catalytic performance with a single indicator. Figure 5 illustrates the linear scaling relationship of the  $\Delta G_{*\rm O}$  versus  $\Delta G_{*\rm OH}$  and  $\Delta G_{*\rm OOH}$  versus  $\Delta G_{*\rm OH}$ , which are described by  $\Delta G_{*\rm OOH}=0.96\Delta G_{*\rm OH}+2.90$  and  $\Delta G_{*\rm O}=1.62\Delta G_{*\rm OH}+0.80$ , revealing a strong linear relationship between  $\Delta G_{*\rm OOH}/\Delta G_{*\rm O}$  and  $\Delta G_{*\rm OH}$ . A similar linear scaling relationship was also obtained for FeMN6@Gra[37] and M@4N-GR[38] catalysts. Thus, the Equations (7)–(10) can be rewritten into the equations as follows.

$$\Delta G_1 = 2.02 - 0.96 \Delta G_{*OH} \tag{13}$$

**Figure 6.** Activity volcano of ORR is shown by a black square and that of OER by a red circle for  $MX@N_6$  catalysts, where the most active SAC for ORR/OER is  $CoS@N_6$  with an overpotential of 0.37/0.29 V, which is closest to the top of the volcano.

$$\Delta G_2 = 2.1 - 0.66 \Delta G_{*OH} \tag{14}$$

$$\Delta G_3 = 0.80 + 0.62 \Delta G_{*OH} \tag{15}$$

$$\Delta G_4 = \Delta G_{*OH} \tag{16}$$

Thus, the ORR and OER activity of all the SACs in this study can be evaluated by the descriptor  $\Delta G_{*OH}$ .

## 3.4. Volcano Activity

A volcano plot was built, as shown in Figure 6, to illustrate the functional relationship between the overpotential of ORR/OER and  $\Delta G_{*OH}$ , which can help us to clarify the relationship between adsorption strength and catalytic performance. For the ORR, the volcano peak appears when  $\Delta G_{^{*}\mathrm{OH}}$  approaches 1.03 eV, essentially corresponding to the best catalysis for ORR. By contrast, the peak of the OER volcano is located at 1.23 eV. On the ascending branch of the ORR volcano, the activity is related to the adsorption strength of \*OH. Essentially, the adsorption strength becomes stronger with the decrease of  $\Delta G_{*OH}$ . However, the strong adsorption is a disadvantage to the formation of second water and poisons the catalytic surface. FeX@N<sub>6</sub> exhibited this behavior in the activity order of FeO > FeS > FeB > FeP. By contrast, the species beyond the peak of the volcano display a contrary tendency. In this case, the adsorption strength of \*OOH becomes weaker with the increase of  $\Delta G_{*_{\mathrm{OH}}}$ , resulting in the difficulty of  $O_2$  to form  $^*$ OOH intermediates. Further, CoX@N $_6$  and NiX@N $_6$  also belong to this category, with the general trend of activity in the order of CoS > CoB > CoO > CoP > NiS > NiB > NiO > NiP. For OER, the catalytic performance exhibited the same trend in general. In particular, the CoS catalyst was simultaneously situated in the middle of the top of the ORR and OER volcanos, thus rendering it the best bifunctional catalyst for ORR and OER. Thus, the moderate adsorption strength of the OER/ORR-relevant oxygenated intermediates is necessary for efficient MX@N6 SACs. Further note that non-metal atoms help moderate the adsorption strength of intermediates to the same metal site. For example, the

overpotential of FeM for ORR decreased three times from 1.05 to 0.38 V by changing the non-metal from P to O atom. Regarding Co and Ni sites, the addition of the S atom is more favorable than the P atom observed at the descending branch of the ORR volcano. Therefore, the moderating role of non-metal atoms must be investigated from the viewpoint of electronic structure.

#### 3.5. Origin of the Excellent Catalytic Performance of CoS@N6

The above analysis indicates that the Co-based catalysts are the most active near the peak of the volcano. All MX@N<sub>6</sub> have better catalytic performance than catalysts without non-metal because the non-metal partner influences the chemical environment of the metal site and regulates its local properties. The possible electronic structure change of the catalysts would be useful to understand the influence of the non-metal atoms. Figure 7a illustrates the partial density of states (PDOS) of the CoX@N<sub>6</sub> and Co@N<sub>6</sub> catalysts, in which the black line represents the PDOS of the Co atom and the orange area represents non-metals. Evidently, the d band center of Co atom in CoS@N<sub>6</sub> with the value of -1.01 eV, followed by CoP@N<sub>6</sub> ( $\epsilon_d = -1.22$  eV) CoO@N<sub>6</sub> ( $\epsilon_d$ = -1.24 eV) CoB@N<sub>6</sub> ( $\epsilon_d$  = -1.26 eV), shifts toward the Fermi level contracted with that of Co atom in Co@N<sub>6</sub> ( $\epsilon_d = -1.32 \text{ eV}$ ). The shifts of d-band center to a high energy level result in the enhancement of binding strength to adsorbates based on the dband center theory.[39] The enhancement effect triggered by the shift of the *d*-band center is first reflected in the adsorption of oxygen, which is the primary step in the ORR. Figure 7b shows the Gibbs free energy of O<sub>2</sub> adsorbed on the Co site. Except for the CoO catalyst, the Gibbs adsorption free energy of O2 increased as the *d*-band center shifted toward the Fermi level. In particular, adding S atoms caused CoS to exhibit the most substantial adsorption. By contrast, Figure 7b shows that the catalytic activity is also enhanced due to the charge transfer. Bader charge analysis indicated that 0.71|e| was transferred to O2 to loosen the O=O bonds when the O<sub>2</sub> bound to the CoS surface.

In the ORR volcano, the catalytic activation of Co-containing SACs is mainly determined by the Gibbs free adsorption energy of OOH. It is needed to understand the details of the interaction between the Co atom and the adsorbates by means of the projected COHP (pCOHP) and integrated COHP (ICOHP) of the Co-OOH bond for CoS, CoO, CoS, CoP, and Co, shown in Figure 7c). The plot above *x*-axis manifests bonding and that below displays the antibonding. ICOHP is used to measure the bond strength, calculated by integrating the pCOHP to the Fermi level. CoS and CoB in Figure 7d) exhibit the strongest Co—O bond strength with an –ICOHP of 1.32 and 1.33 eV, respectively, followed by CoP (1.28 eV) and CoO (1.22 eV). Evidently, they all were more significant than that of Co (1.19), thus suggesting that the non-metal strengthens the Co-OOH bond and thus improves the activation of the Co site.

#### 4. Conclusion

In summary, the concept of d-p hybridization of SACs MX@N<sub>6</sub> with metal-non-metal pairs anchored on N-doped graphene for ORR and OER was proposed, particularly with a transition metal

Among these studied SACs, CoS@N6, exhibited bifunctional catalytic activity and excellent stability and was evaluated as the best catalyst. Electronic structure analysis revealed that the hybridization of the p energy band of the S atom and the *d*-band of the Co atom promotes the adsorption and electron transfer between O2 and the catalyst, thus providing a promising alternative to further enhance the catalytic performance of SAC catalysts. Our theoretical study on SACs with well-optimized *d*-*p* hybridization guides the rational design of ORR and OER catalysts.

**Developing cost-effective and high-efficiency electrocatalysts toward alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is crucial for water splitting. Amorphous bimetallic NiFe-based (oxy)hydroxides have excellent OER activity under alkaline media, but their poorly electrical conductivity impedes the further improvement of their catalytic performance. Herein, a bimetallic NiFe-based heterostructure electrocatalyst that is composed of amorphous NiFe(OH)***x* **and crystalline pyrite (Ni, Fe)Se2 nanosheet arrays is designed and constructed. The catalyst exhibits an outstanding OER performance, only requiring low overpotentials of 180, 220, and 230 mV at the current density of 10, 100, and 300 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> and a low Tafel slope of 42 mV dec<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> in 1 m KOH, which is among the state-of-the-art OER catalysts. Based on the experimental and theoretical results, the electronic coupling at the interface that leads to the increased electrical conductivity and the optimized adsorption free energies of the oxygen-contained intermediates plays a crucial role in enhancing the OER activities. This work focusing on improving the OER performance via engineering amorphous-crystalline bimetallic heterostructure may provide some inspiration for reasonably designing advanced electrocatalysts.**

### **1. Introduction**

As one of the renewable and clean energy sources, the hydrogen energy is of crucial importance in addressing the energy crisis and the environmental pollution.[1,2] Water splitting to generate H2 at the cathode has been considered as a green, efficient

method.[3] However, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode is an inherently sluggish kinetics process due to its complicated four-electron transfer process and hence becomes the bottleneck of water splitting.[4,5] Although Ir or Rubased oxides are at present well known as the efficient OER catalysts at present, their scarcity and high cost limit the large-scale commercial application.[6–8] Therefore, the exploitation of cost-effective nonprecious metal-based electrocatalysts is of significant importance for the industrial water splitting.[9–11]

Recently, earth-abundant 3d transition-metal-based (Fe, Co, and Ni) oxides/ hydroxides/oxyhydroxides have been regarded as promising alternative as their high OER activities and low cost.[12–15] Especially, NiFe-based (oxy)hydroxides (NiFeOOH) exhibit distinguished OER performance due to their bimetallic synergistic effect that leads to beneficial elec-

tronic structure.[16–18] However, the poorly electric conductivity of the NiFeOOH impedes the further enhancement of its OER performance. To address this issue, some researchers try to utilize NiFe-based sulfides, selenides and phosphides[19–22] with better conductivity to replace NiFe-based (oxy)hydroxides, and most of their results are perfect apparently. But further studies uncover that these nonoxide NiFe-based compounds are not stable under high oxidation potential and will transform to NiFe (oxy)hydroxides, and the true reason for the improvement of the OER activities may be attributed to the increased active site numbers rather than the enhanced conductivity or improved intrinsic activities.[23,24] Additionally, some recent studies reveal that the generated (oxy)hydroxides during electrochemical oxidation process are amorphous, and the amorphous structure may be also beneficial for OER due to its better intrinsic activity derived from high-valent nickel.[25–27] The above researches indicate that the issue of the poor conductivity of NiFeOOH has not been solved yet.

The interface engineering, especially core–shell structure, which utilizes the advantages of two materials and avoid their disadvantages, is widely utilized to enhance the catalytic activity and stability of the catalysts.[28] This is because the synergistic effect at the interface can modulates the electron

structure of the catalysts, possibly leading to the enhanced conductivity and the favorable adsorption energies of the intermediates, as well as adding active sites and promoting mass transfer.[29,30] Motivated by the high OER intrinsic activities of amorphous NiFeOOH[31,32] and the good conductivity of crystalline pyrite (Ni, Fe)Se2, [33] we assume that the construction of a core–shell heterostructure that is composed of amorphous NiFe(OH)*x* (shell) and crystalline (Ni, Fe)Se2 (core) (NiFe(OH)*x*/(Ni, Fe)Se2) may gain an excellent OER performance. Herein, we successfully fabricated a novel, core-shell NiFe(OH)*x*/(Ni, Fe)Se2 heterostructure catalyst by coating a thin amorphous NiFe(OH)*x* layer on crystalline (Ni, Fe)Se2 nanosheets arrays using an electrodeposited method. The heterostructure catalyst exhibits low overpotentials of only 180, 220, and 230 mV at 10, 100, and 300 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2 and a Tafel slope of 42 mV dec−<sup>1</sup> in 1 m KOH, which is among the most advanced OER catalysts, and shows excellent long-term durability up to 20 h. The experimental results in combination with the density functional theory (DFT) calculation reveal that the increased conductivity together with the improved intrinsic activity are mainly responsible for the obviously enhanced OER performance.

### **2. Results and Discussion**

The NiFe(OH)*x*/(Ni, Fe)Se2/CC catalyst was synthesized through a multistep process, as shown in **Figure 1**. First, NiFe-LDH nanosheet arrays were fabricated on a piece of carbon cloth by a hydrothermal method (Figure S1, Supporting Information), followed by hydrothermal selenization to convert into (Ni, Fe)Se2/CC nanosheet arrays. Then, an amorphous NiFe(OH)*x* layer was deposited on the surface of (Ni, Fe)Se2/CC by electrodeposition to form a core–shell NiFe(OH)*x*/(Ni, Fe) Se2/CC heterostructure electrocatalyst.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used to characterize the phase structure of the as-prepared products, as shown in **Figure 2**a. The broad peak between 20° and 30° belongs to CC, and all other diffraction peaks of (Ni, Fe)Se2 sample are indexed to pyrite NiSe2 (JCPDS 41-1495). However, the diffraction peaks of (Ni, Fe)Se2 have slightly negative shift compared with that of NiSe2, as shown in the inset of Figure S2 (Supporting Information). The negative shift of diffraction angles (2*θ*) for (Ni, Fe)Se2 may be attributed to the substitution of Ni ion with a smaller ionic radius (72 pm) by Fe ion with a larger ionic radius (76 pm) in the unit cell of NiSe2, [34] leading to an increase in lattice

constant and a decrease in  $2\theta$  value, according to the Bragg equation ( $2\text{dsin}\theta = n\lambda$ ). After electrodeposition, the diffraction pattern of the product is almost unchanged comparing with (Ni, Fe)Se<sub>2</sub>, which may be attributed to the fact that the deposited NiFe-based (oxy)hydroxides may be amorphous. In order to further confirm the assumption, Raman spectrum analysis was performed, as shown in Figure 2b. It can be observed that, for (Ni, Fe)Se<sub>2</sub>/CC sample, the characteristic Raman peaks located at 132, 145, 206, and 232 cm<sup>-1</sup> are assigned to (Ni, Fe)Se<sub>2</sub>. But for the sample after electrodeposition, three other broaden peaks located at  $\approx$ 484, 552, and 678 cm<sup>-1</sup> appear, which are corresponding to the characteristic Raman peaks of amorphous NiFe(OH)<sub>x</sub>. The XRD and Raman results show that the amorphous-crystalline NiFe(OH)<sub>x</sub>/(Ni, Fe)Se<sub>2</sub> heterostructure has been successfully fabricated.

Furthermore, the scanning electron microscope (SEM) images reveal that the synthesized NiFe-LDH precursors are consisted of vertically aligned thin nanosheets with smooth surface (Figure S3, Supporting Information). After selenization, as shown in Figure 3a,b; and Figure S4a (Supporting Information), the vertical (Ni, Fe)Se $_2$  nanosheets still remain, but their thickness increases from  $\approx$ 26 to  $\approx$ 45 nm and the surface of the nanosheets became rough. Moreover, it can be observed that a thinly flocculent layer is coated on the surface of (Ni, Fe)Se $_2$

nanosheets after electrodeposition for 300 s, which is identified as amorphous NiFe(OH) $_x$  (Figure 3c,d; and Figure S5a, Supporting Information). [21,37] The transmission electron microscope (TEM) image shown in Figure 3e also confirms the nanosheet structure of NiFe(OH) $_x$ /(Ni, Fe)Se $_2$ /CC. Further observing the edge of one typical nanosheet by using high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) technology, we can find that the nanoplate is composed of a dense, amorphous ultrathin shell with thickness of  $\approx$ 5 nm and a crystalline core. The clear lattice fringe with an interplanar spacing of 0.265 nm (Figure 3f) is ascribed to pyrite (Ni, Fe)Se $_2$ , [38] and the corresponding selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (inset of Figure 3e) also supports this conclusion. Additionally, Elemental mapping analysis in Figure 3g–k shows that all four elements, Ni, Fe, Se, and O are distributed throughout the nanosheet.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were used to determine the chemical composition and valence states of the catalysts. The presence of Ni, Fe, Se, O, and C elements in NiFe(OH)<sub>x</sub>/(Ni, Fe)Se<sub>2</sub>/CC catalyst can be proved by XPS spectrum shown in Figure S6 (Supporting Information), which is in agreement with the energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) results (Figures S4b and S5b, Supporting Information). Figure 4a-d shows the high resolution XPS spectra of Ni 2p, Fe 2p, Se 3d, and O 1s, respectively. For Ni 2p spectrum of NiFe(OH)<sub>x</sub>/(Ni, Fe) Se<sub>2</sub>/CC sample (Figure 4a), the two fitted peaks located at 856.3 and 874.3 eV along with two satellite peaks (862.1 and 880.7 eV) are assigned to Ni 2p<sub>3/2</sub> and Ni 2p<sub>1/2</sub> belonged to Ni-O bond, while the other two peaks located at 853.7 and 871.7 eV are corresponding to Ni 2p orbits of Ni-Se bond.<sup>[25]</sup> In comparison with single NiFe(OH)<sub>x</sub>/CC and (Ni, Fe)Se<sub>2</sub>/CC, the Ni 2p peaks of NiFe(OH)<sub>x</sub>/(Ni, Fe)Se<sub>2</sub>/CC belonged to both Ni-O bond and Ni-Se bond shift toward higher binding energies, which means Ni has higher valance state, also implying that NiFe(OH)<sub>x</sub>/(Ni, Fe)Se<sub>2</sub>/CC may own better OER activity as high-valent nickel in NiFe-based catalysts will accelerate water oxidation. [39] For Fe 2p region of NiFe(OH)<sub>x</sub>/(Ni, Fe)Se<sub>2</sub>/CC (Figure 4b), the binding energy at 707.1 eV is attributed to Fe-Se bond, which is consistent with previous reports, and two peaks at 712.3 and 725.9 eV together with two satellite peaks are corresponding to Fe 2p<sub>3/2</sub> and Fe 2p<sub>1/2</sub> of Fe-O bond, respectively.<sup>[20,40]</sup> As for Se 3d region (Figure 4c), the peak at 58.3 eV is assigned to Se-O bond due to the surface oxidation of Se element, and the fitted two peaks at 53.6 and 54.4 eV are corresponding to Se  $3d_{5/2}$  and Se  $3d_{3/2}$  of Se<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup> in the heterostructure. [34] The negative shift of Se 3d spectrum of NiFe(OH)<sub>x</sub>/(Ni, Fe)Se<sub>2</sub>/CC in contrast to (Ni, Fe)Se<sub>2</sub> validate a decreased valence state of selenium ions. Additionally, the high-resolution O 1s spectrum of the heterostructure (Figure 4d) can be fitted to three peaks, which are corresponding to physically adsorbed H<sub>2</sub>O molecular, chemically adsorbed O-H species and M-O bonds, respectively.<sup>[21]</sup> In a word, the XPS result validates that the strongly electronic coupling exists in the heterostructure, and the resulting high-valent nickel may enhance the OER performance of the catalyst. [41]

The OER performance of NiFe(OH) $_{\rm x}$ /(Ni, Fe)Se $_{\rm 2}$ /CC is evaluated by carrying out the electrochemical tests in a 1 m KOH electrolyte solution using a standard three-electrode system, and NiFe-LDH/CC, NiFe(OH) $_{\rm x}$ /CC, (Ni, Fe)Se $_{\rm 2}$ /CC and commercial IrO $_{\rm 2}$  electrodes coated on bare carbon cloth with the same mass loading were also tested as control samples under the same

conditions. The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) polarization curve shows that the amorphous-crystalline heterostructure of NiFe(OH)<sub>x</sub>/(Ni, Fe)Se<sub>2</sub>/CC displays excellent catalytic activity toward alkaline water oxidation, only needing relatively low overpotentials of 180, 220, and 230 mV to reach the current densities of 10, 100, and 300 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, which is obviously superior to that of NiFe-LDH/CC (250, 320, and 380 mV), amorphous NiFe(OH) $_x$ /CC (250, 310, and 350 mV), (Ni, Fe)Se $_2$ / CC (240, 290, and 310 mV), IrO<sub>2</sub>/CC (300 and 420 mV) electrodes, and NiFe(OH)<sub>x</sub>/(Ni, Fe)Se<sub>2</sub>/CC with other electrodeposited time, as shown in Figure 5a; and Figure S7 (Supporting Information). In addition, the Tafel slope of the heterostructure electrode (42 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>) illustrated in Figure 5b is smaller than NiFe-LDH/CC (73 mV  $dec^{-1}$ ), NiFe(OH)<sub>x</sub>/CC (57 mV  $dec^{-1}$ ), (Ni, Fe)Se<sub>2</sub>/CC (48 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>), and  $IrO_2$  (76 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>), also suggesting a faster kinetics. To our best knowledge, the asprepared heterostructure catalyst that exhibits excellent alkaline OER catalytic activity in this work exceeds the commercial IrO<sub>2</sub> and RuO2 catalysts and most of the recently reported catalysts, and is among the state-of-the-art OER catalysts, as shown in Figure 5c<sup>[26,37,42–53]</sup> and Table S1 (Supporting Information).

To identify why the heterostructure electrode owns superior OER performance, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) test was carried out. The Nyquist plots with an equivalent circuit for different electrodes are illustrated in Figure 5d, which shows that the NiFe(OH) $_x$ /(Ni, Fe)Se $_z$ /CC electrode has a smaller  $R_{ct}$  value (2.2  $\Omega$ ) than NiFe-LDH/CC (5.3  $\Omega$ ), NiFe(OH) $_x$ /CC(4.6  $\Omega$ ), and (Ni, Fe)Se $_z$ /CC (4.3  $\Omega$ ), implying a faster electronic transfer at the solid–liquid interface. Moreover,

the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) is also an important factor to influence the catalytic activity, which can be calculated by the measured double-layer capacitance ( $C_{\rm dl}$ ) (Figure 5e) due to their linear relation, and the detailed calculation formula is illustrated in the Experimental Section. The NiFe(OH)<sub>x</sub>/(Ni, Fe)Se<sub>2</sub>/CC has larger ECSA value (177) than NiFe-LDH/CC (58.75), NiFe(OH)<sub>x</sub>/CC (62.75), and (Ni, Fe)Se<sub>2</sub>/CC (106.5), implying more active sites. To exclude the contribution of ECSA for OER performance, the ECSA-normalized LSV curves were also performed, as displayed in Figure S8 (Supporting Information). The result indicates that NiFe(OH)<sub>x</sub>/(Ni, Fe)Se<sub>2</sub>/CC still has the best intrinsic OER performance among the samples.

Moreover, the stability test is very necessary to assess the electrocatalysts performance in practical applications. Figure 5f shows the LSV curve of NiFe(OH)<sub>x</sub>/(Ni, Fe)Se<sub>2</sub>/CC after 3000 cyclic voltammetry (CV) cycles, which is barely changed relative to the initial LSV curve, implying an excellent stability. In addition, the long-term durability test of the NiFe(OH)<sub>x</sub>/(Ni, Fe)Se2/CC electrode was also measured under an overpotential of 220 mV (vs RHE) for 20 h (inset of Figure 5f), and the current density can maintain 96%, also validating its superior long-term stability during OER process in 1 м КОН. Given the electrochemical stability is determined by the structure of the catalysts, we further studied the structure of NiFe(OH)<sub>x</sub>/ (Ni, Fe)Se<sub>2</sub>/CC after stability test by using XRD, EDS, SEM, and TEM measurements, and the characterization of (Ni, Fe) Se<sub>2</sub>/CC after stability test was also provided for comparison, as shown in Figures S9-S12 (Supporting Information). The XRD

and HRTEM results (Figures S9a and S11d, Supporting Information) indicate that (Ni, Fe)Se2/CC after electrochemical treatment has been almost transformed to amorphous NiFe(OH)*x*/ CC, which is consistent with the previous study,[25] but NiFe(OH)*x*/(Ni, Fe)Se2/CC after electrochemical test maintains the crystalline phase of (Ni, Fe)Se2 (Figure S9b, Supporting Information), which may be attributed to the antioxidation protection of the NiFe(OH)*x* shell (Figure S12d, Supporting Information).[37] For (Ni, Fe)Se2/CC catalyst, although the superficial NiFe-based oxides/hydroxides will also be formed on its surface during OER, the catalyst is easy to be oxidized because these oxides/hydroxides layers are full of pinholes and pores.[25] However, for the as-prepared NiFe(OH)*x*/(Ni, Fe)Se2/CC heterostructure, the dense and continuous preformed NiFe(OH)*<sup>x</sup>* shell (Figure 3f) can effectively prevent the oxidation of the inner selenides, as validated by XRD and HRTEM results (Figures S9b and S12d, Supporting Information).[54,55] Additionally, the EDS result of the heterostructure catalyst after OER has almost unchanged (Figure S10, Supporting Information), indicating the stability of the chemical composition. The SEM and TEM results also validate that the core–shell heterostructure nanosheet arrays are well maintained after OER (Figures S11 and S12, Supporting Information). From all the characterization results, it can conclude that the good electrochemical stability of the NiFe(OH)*x*/(Ni, Fe)Se2/CC after OER is correlated with the structure stability.

To deeply understand the relationship between the heterostructure and the catalytic activity, the density functional theory (DFT) calculation was performed. As was confirmed NiFebased oxides/hydroxides catalysts would be transformed into NiFe oxyhydroxides (NiFeOOH) during the OER process,[56] so we construct a heterostructure model of NiFeOOH/(Ni, Fe)Se2

instead of NiFe(OH)*x*/(Ni, Fe)Se2. In view of a small interfacial strain (0.54%) between the (110) facet of NiFeOOH and the (100) facet of (Ni, Fe)Se2 based on strain calculation, we selected this two faces as coupled planes at the interface, which is shown in **Figure 6**a, and the single NiFeOOH is also calculated for comparison (Figure S13, Supporting Information). The differential charge densities of the heterostructure illustrated in Figure 6b display that the charge densities of Ni atom belonged to NiFeOOH at the interface are reduced, implying the Ni at the interface of the heterostructure has higher chemical valence, which may be beneficial for OER.[57,58] Generally, the OER process involves four coupled proton–electron transfer steps. The structure models with different oxygen-contained intermediates as well as the Gibbs free energy profiles of different steps for NiFeOOH and NiFeOOH/(Ni, Fe)Se2 are illustrated in Figure 6c,d; and Figure S14 (Supporting Information), where the Ni atom is considered as the active site according to the previous works.[59–61] For NiFeOOH, the rate-determining step is the second step from \*OH to \*O, with an overpotential of 1.1 V. However, for the heterostructure, the rate-determining step is changed into the third step from \*O to \*OOH, and the overpotential is reduced to 0.98 V, implying a faster electrochemical kinetics. Additionally, the electrical conductivity of the catalysts is also an important factor to influence their catalytic activities, which can be evaluated by using the total densities of states (DOS) of NiFeOOH/(Ni, Fe)Se2 and NiFeOOH, as shown in Figure S15 (Supporting Information). It can be obviously seen that NiFeOOH/(Ni, Fe)Se2 exhibits metallic character, because the DOS of the heterostructure around Fermi level are continuous and obviously larger than NiFeOOH that shows a semiconductive character. In a word, the DFT calculation has demonstrated that the heterostructure not only optimizes the free energies of the adsorbed oxygen-contained intermediates, but also increase the conductivity of the NiFe (oxy)hydroxides.

### **3. Conclusions**

In summary, we have successfully fabricated a bimetallic NiFebased heterostructure nanosheet array, which is composed of amorphous NiFe(OH)*x* and crystalline (Ni, Fe)Se2. The NiFe(OH)*x*/(Ni, Fe)Se2/CC catalyst shows an excellent catalytic activity toward OER with a low overpotential of 180 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm−<sup>2</sup> and a low Tafel slope of 42 mV dec−<sup>1</sup> in 1 m KOH, as well as good long-term durability up to 20 h. The electronic coupling at the interface of the heterostructure leads to the optimized free energies of adsorbed oxygen-contained intermediates, the enhanced electroconductivity and the increased active site numbers, which accounts for the superior OER performance. This work offers a rational design for exploring a series of novel and high-efficient OER electrocatalysts and beyond by means of engineering amorphous-crystalline heterostructure.

### **4. Experimental Section**

*Materials*: Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, Fe(NO3)3∙9H2O, NH4F and urea were purchased from Tianjin Fuchen Chemical Reagent Factory. NaBH4 and Se powder were purchased from Aladdin. KOH, commercial Pt/C (20 wt%), IrO2 and Nafion (5 wt%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Carbon cloths (CC) were provided by CeTech Co. Ltd. The deionized water was collected through a Millipore system. All the reagents and chemicals were used as received without further treatment.

*Synthesis of NiFe-LDH/CC*: First, the carbon cloth was ultrasonicated with acetone and 3 m sulfuric acid for 20 min, respectively, then washed with water and ethanol to remove surface oxides and dried in air. NiFe-LDH/CC was prepared by a hydrothermal method, and the specific steps are as follows: 2 mmol of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, 0.25 mmol of Fe(NO3)2·9H2O, 4 mmol of NH4F, and 10 mmol of urea were dissolved in 35 mL of deionized water, stirred and a clear solution was obtained, and the solution was transferred to the Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave. Then, a clean CC (1 × 3 cm2 ) was placed in an autoclave, and reacted at 120 °C for 6 h to obtain NiFe-LDH/CC. The sample was taken out, washed several times with ethanol and water, and placed in a vacuum oven at 60 °C for drying.

*Synthesis of (Ni, Fe)Se2/CC*: Nitrogen gas was bubbled through the ethanol solution for 20 min to remove the internal air, then 0.065 g of NaBH4 and 0.059 g of Se powder were dissolved in 1.5 mL of deionized water, reacted until the solution was clear, and poured into 30 mL of ethanol. The above solution was transferred to the Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave. Then, a piece of NiFe-LDH/CC (1 × 3 cm2 ) was placed in an autoclave, and reacted at 140 °C for 12 h to obtain (Ni, Fe)Se2/CC. The sample was taken out, washed several times with ethanol and water, and placed in a vacuum oven at 60 °C for drying.

*Synthesis of NiFe(OH)x/(Ni, Fe)Se2/CC and NiFe(OH)x/CC*: The synthesis of NiFe(OH)*x*/(Ni, Fe)Se2/CC was obtained by an electrodeposited process. The electrodeposited process was carried out in a three-electrode system using (Ni, Fe)Se2/CC as the working electrode, as well as the graphite rod and saturated calomel electrode as the counter electrode and the reference electrode, respectively. The electrolyte was prepared by dissolving 2 mmol of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O and 0.25 mmol of Fe(NO3)2·9H2O in 25 mL of deionized water. After electrodeposition at −1.0 V for different time (200, 300, and 400 s), NiFe(OH)*x*/(Ni, Fe)Se2/CC was obtained. Then the sample was taken out, washed several times with deionized water, and placed in a vacuum oven at 60 °C for drying. Besides, the preparing process of NiFe(OH)*x*/ CC is similar to that of NiFe(OH)*x*/(Ni, Fe)Se2/CC, obtained by electrodeposition of the carbon cloth directly.

*Characterization*: The crystal structure of the samples was identified by an XRD (Bruker AXS diffractometer with Cu K*α* radiation). The morphologies and chemical composition of the samples were determined by SEM (FEI Quanta-450 FEG), TEM (JEM-2010HR), and EDS, respectively. The chemical state of the elements was investigated by XPS (ESCALAB 250Xi). The chemical structure and molecular structure of the samples were determined by Raman Spectrum (Raman, Renishaw inVia Reflex).

*Electrochemical Measurements*: All electrochemical tests were performed under a standard three-electrode system by a CHI604E electrochemical workstation at room temperature. The prepared NiFe-LDH/CC, (Ni, Fe)Se2/CC, and NiFe(OH)*x*/(Ni, Fe)Se2/CC as the working electrode, respectively, the graphite rod electrode as the counter electrode and the saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the reference electrode. The electrolyte was 1 m KOH solution. All potentials were calibrated against a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). The working electrode was electrochemically activated multiple times at a scan rate of 100 and 20 mV s−<sup>1</sup> by CV test prior to LSV test. The LSV test has a scan rate of 2 mV s−<sup>1</sup> with 95% iR-correction. EIS was measured at the potential of 1.5V (vs RHE) with a frequency range from 1 to 10 MHz. The double layered capacitance (*C*dl) of the materials were estimated by CV tested in a non-Faradaic region with the scan rates of 25, 50, 75, 100, 150, 200, 300 mV s−<sup>1</sup> , respectively. The ECSA of materials was estimated from their double layered capacitance (*C*dl). The ECSA of a catalyst sample is calculated from the double layer capacitance according to the following equation: ECSA = *C*dl/*C*s, where *C*s is the specific capacitance of the sample, which is normally between 20 and 60 µF cm<sup>−</sup>2. Therefore, an average value of 40 µF cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> was used in the calculation.[62] The selected potential window was beyond the possible Faraday region of the materials and obtained at different scan rates. The CV cycle was first tested at a 100 mV s<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> scan rate from 1.1 to 1.8 V for RHE for 3000 cycles, and the final LSV polarization curve was recorded at 2 mV s<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> . The use of chronoamperometry to apply a constant potential without compensating iR drop was intended to evaluate the long-term durability of the electrocatalyst.

*Computational Method*: All calculations are performed with the Vienna abinitio simulation package (VASP) code by using the pseudopotential plane-wave scheme.[63,64] The interactions between ions and electrons are described by the projector augmented wave (PAW) method developed by BLÖCHL.[65] The cutoff energy of the plane wave basis set is set to be 400 eV, and the Brillouin-zone integration is performed by 3 × 3 × 1 Monkhorst-Pack special k-points for geometry optimization and 5 × 5 × 1 k-points for electronic structure calculation. All atoms are fully relaxed with the total energy change less than 10−<sup>5</sup> eV and the force on each ion less than 0.02 eV Å−<sup>1</sup> . The Hubbard+U corrected term is applied to solve the underestimation of transition metal states, and the effective values *U*–*J* are set as 6 and 4 eV for Ni and Fe.[66]

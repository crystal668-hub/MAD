## Bifunctional electrocatalytic activity of Fe-embedded biphenylene for oxygen reduction and evolution reactions†

Junkai Xu,‡a Yang Gao,‡a Jing Li,a Xun-Wang Yan \*\* and Fengjie Ma \*\* \*\*

Transition metal single-atom catalysts have attracted great attention because of their great potential applications in the chemical industry. Except for graphene, there are few single-layer materials that can act as substrates to support the dispersive metal atoms. Recently, a biphenylene layer, a new two-dimensional allotrope of graphene, was synthesized in experiments, providing a new substrate layer to fabricate single-atom catalysts (SACs). In this work, we predict three transition metal SACs MN<sub>4</sub>-biphenylene (M = Fe, Co, and Ni) based on firstprinciples calculations. The results indicate that FeN<sub>4</sub>-biphenylene is a promising bifunctional catalyst with low overpotentials for both the oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction,  $\eta_{ORR} = 0.11 \text{ V}$ and  $\eta_{OER}$  = 0.27 V. The high catalytic activities are explained by the position of the d-band center of the Fe atom in the biphenylene network and the strength of interaction between FeN<sub>4</sub>-biphenylene and the reaction intermediates.

To solve the problems of the energy and environmental crisis in the future, more and more new energy storage and conversion technologies are being developed, including water decomposition, metal-air cell, and fuel cell technologies.<sup>1,2</sup> Among them, catalysts with low cost and high activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) play a key role. At the present stage, noble-metal catalysts are still the most widespread and prior catalysts for the OER and ORR in relevant industrial applications.<sup>3,4</sup> However, the disadvantages of scarcity and high cost greatly impede the large-scale commercial application of noble metal catalysts.<sup>5</sup> Therefore, it is urgent to develop low-cost and highly efficient catalysts for the OER and ORR to replace noble metal catalysts.

In recent years, single-atom catalysts (SACs) have attracted much attention from researchers and are expected to be ideal substitutes for noble-metal catalysts.<sup>6</sup> In the SACs, metal atoms are anchored on the surface of the supports in the form of individual atoms. Their merits are high utilization of metal atoms and low cost, while the disadvantage is that it is difficult to fabricate the SACs in experiments because metal atoms tend to form clusters in the preparation process. For a SAC, the metal atom is embedded in the substrate and bonded to the atoms around it. It is obvious that the substrate has a great influence on the electronic state of metal atoms and further on the overall catalytic performance.<sup>8,9</sup> Therefore, the substrate layer to support the metal atoms is vital for high efficiency SACs.

In the past few years, graphene, 10 carbon nanotubes, 11 carbon nitride monolayers, 12 and transition metal halide materials<sup>13</sup> have been employed to support the metal atoms to synthesize the SACs. Among them, graphene is a good substrate layer, in which the metal atoms are planted in the form of a planar MN<sub>4</sub> moiety. These graphene-based SACs not only show good stability but also have excellent catalytic activity and high selectivity.

As a new allotrope of graphene, biphenylene was recently prepared in experiments by Fan et al. 14 Unlike graphene, biphenylene has not only six-atom rings but also four-atom rings and eight-atom rings. In addition, biphenylene is a conductor, while graphene is a semiconductor. Biphenylene has many advantages similar to graphene, such as a large specific surface area, strong electron transfer ability, good stability, and easy modification and decoration of the surface. Recently, Luo et al. explored the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalytic performance of pure biphenylene, and the results showed that biphenylene has a lower overpotential than pure graphene. 15 Liu et al. calculated the ORR activity of biphenylene and concluded that biphenylene had better catalytic activity for the ORR process under alkaline conditions.<sup>16</sup> However, as far as we know, there is no report on the catalytic performance of transition metal-embedded biphenylene systems at present. Hence, to explore whether the biphenylene-based SACs have better ORR and OER activities is very necessary.

In this work, we study the catalytic properties of MN<sub>4</sub>biphenylene based on first-principles calculations, and FeN<sub>4</sub>-

(d) Atomic structure of the MN<sub>4</sub>graphene SACs (M = Fe, Co, and Ni). The large rectangle with black dashed line is the supercell in the calculations. The brown and blue dashed line rectangles indicate the replacement of six carbon atoms by one MN<sub>4</sub> moiety.

biphenylene is demonstrated to be a bifunctional catalyst with the ORR and OER overpotential of 0.11 V and 0.27 V, respectively, which is superior to almost all bifunctional catalysts reported in previous studies. The mechanism of high catalytic performance is explained by the reasonable d-band center of the Fe atom in the biphenylene sheet and the bonding strength of FeN<sub>4</sub>-biphenylene and intermediate reactions.

The biphenylene monolayer is composed of four-, six-, and eight-membered rings of carbon atoms, fused together with a shared edge. Fig. 1(a) shows a  $3 \times 3$  supercell of biphenylene, in which the brown dashed lines denote a primitive cell with the lattice parameters a = 3.76 Å and b = 4.52 Å. Based on the biphenylene monolayer, the MN<sub>4</sub>-biphenylene SACs are constructed and shown in Fig. 1(b), where one cell of a  $3 \times 3$  supercell is replaced by an MN4 unit. The transition metal atom M is the active center of the SACs, which is embedded in the biphenylene sheet with the aid of four N atoms.

Firstly, we perform the formation energy calculations to evaluate the stability of MN<sub>4</sub>-biphenylene (M = Fe, Co, and Ni), which is defined as

$$E_{\text{form}} = E_{\text{tot}} - E_{N_4-\text{biphenylene}} - E_{M_*}$$
 (1)

 $E_{\rm tot}$  and  $E_{\rm N_4-biphenylene}$  are the total energy and the N<sub>4</sub>-biphenylene energy, respectively. As in previous studies,  $^{17}E_{M}$  is the bulk metal energy per atom, which in general is the energy limit of a metal atomic cluster. 18 The formation energies of MN<sub>4</sub>-biphenylene are labeled as  $E_{\text{form}}^{\text{a}}$  and listed in Table 1. The negative values indicate that MN<sub>4</sub>-biphenylene is thermodynamically stable and metal atoms do not tend to migrate and aggregate into a cluster.

Table 1 The formation energies of  $MN_4$ -biphenylene ( $E_{form}^a$ ) and  $MN_4$ graphene (E<sup>b</sup><sub>form</sub>), and the dissolution potentials of MN<sub>4</sub>-biphenylene. The standard dissolution potentials for Fe, Co, and Ni metals ( $U_{\text{diss-bulk}}$ ) and the number of transferred electrons ( $N_e$ ) are from ref. 26

| $E_{ m form}^{ m a}$ | -2.05   | -1.41            | -1.62   |
| $E_{ m form}^{ m b}$ | -2.29   | -2.47            | -2.80   |
| $U_{ m diss-bulk}$   | -0.45   | -0.28            | -0.26   |
| $n_{\rm e}$          | 2       | 2                | 2       |
| $U_{ m diss}$        | 0.57    | 0.42             | 0.59    |

For comparison, the formation energies  $(E_{\text{form}}^{\text{b}})$  of MN<sub>4</sub>graphene (M = Fe, Co, and Ni) are also calculated. A 4  $\times$  4 supercell of graphene is employed, and six carbon atoms in the supercell are replaced by an MN<sub>4</sub> moiety to form the MN<sub>4</sub>graphene composites, exhibited in Fig. 1(c) and (d). These MN<sub>4</sub>graphene composites have been extensively studied both experimentally and theoretically. 19-25 As can be seen in Table 1, the formation energies of MN<sub>4</sub>-biphenylene are lower than or close to the ones of MN<sub>4</sub>-graphene, indicating that it is highly feasible to fabricate the MN<sub>4</sub>-biphenylene SACs experimentally.

To examine the electrochemical stability of MN<sub>4</sub>-biphenylene in solution, the dissolution potential  $U_{\text{diss}}$  is computed, which is defined by the equation

$$U_{\rm diss} = U_{\rm diss-bulk} - \frac{E_{\rm form}}{n_e e},$$
 (2)

where  $U_{\rm diss-bulk}$  is the standard dissolution potential of metal bulk and  $n_{\rm e}$  is the number of transferred electrons during the process of dissolution.  $^{26}$  Theoretically, a positive value of  $U_{\rm diss}$ indicates that the catalyst is stable in electrochemistry. For the three kinds of single-atom catalysts, their dissolution potentials satisfy the stability condition and the relevant data are presented in Table 1. Additionally, the molecular dynamics calculations are performed at 500 K for 10 ps. The total potential energies fluctuate around a certain value and no distinct drop occurs, and the three MN<sub>4</sub>-biphenylene systems can maintain basically their original framework. The energy evolution with time and the snapshot of structural configurations are displayed in the ESI.† Hence, the MN<sub>4</sub>-biphenylene SACs (M = Fe, Co, and Ni) are thermally stable.

Next, we investigate the ORR and OER activity of MN<sub>4</sub>biphenylene catalysts. In general, there are two types of mechanism of O2 electroreduction, dissociation and association. Based on the calculations of total energy and reaction barrier, displayed in the ESI,† we conclude that the associative mechanism<sup>3</sup> with a four-electron pathway is dominant in the catalytic reaction on MN<sub>4</sub>-biphenylene. For the ORR or OER, the reaction rate is always limited by a certain elementary reaction called the potential-determining step (PDS). In the OER process, the step with the maximum potential increment is the PDS, while the step with the minimum potential drop is the PDS in the ORR process. The catalyst activity, closely related to the reaction rate, is measured by the overpotential, which is defined as the difference between the potential change at the PDS and the equilibrium potential of 1.23 V. Fig. 2(a) shows the ORR on FeN<sub>4</sub>-biphenylene, where the black lines indicate

the free energies at each reaction step when the applied electrode potential is zero. Its PDS is the third step (\*O  $\rightarrow$ \*OH) with the minimum potential drop of 1.12 eV (from -2.63to -3.75 eV). At the equilibrium potential of 1.23 V, the energies are marked with red lines, which show steps 1, 3, and 4 become uphill, and these steps are hindered because they are endothermic. To keep the free energy declining at every step, the electrode potential should be lower than 1.12 V. The free energy profile is represented by the blue lines at this limiting potential. For the OER of FeN<sub>4</sub>-biphenylene catalysts shown in Fig. 2(b), it is limited by step 3 (\*O  $\rightarrow$  \*OOH), which is the PDS and has the maximum of potential rise (3.79 V - 2.29 V = 1.50 V). The applied potential of 1.50 V is the minimum potential to assure that all the steps are exothermic reactions. In Fig. 2(b), the blue lines represent the free energies under the potential of 1.50 V applied to each step.

Similarly, we also carry out the calculations for the ORR and OER on CoN<sub>4</sub>-biphenylene and NiN<sub>4</sub>-biphenylene. The free energy diagrams are shown in Fig. 2(c)-(f). It is easy to see that the first step is the PDS. For the ORR on CoN<sub>4</sub>-biphenylene and NiN<sub>4</sub>-biphenylene, the PDS is the step from \* + O<sub>2</sub> to \*OOH and their potential changes are -0.13 V and 0.60 V, which differ greatly from the ideal value of -1.23 V. For the OER on the two catalysts, the step from \* + H<sub>2</sub>O to \*OH is the PDS, for which the potential changes are 1.90 V and 2.36 V for CoN<sub>4</sub>-biphenylene and NiN<sub>4</sub>-biphenylene, respectively.

Then, let's evaluate the overpotentials for the above reactions. The ORR and OER overpotentials of the MN<sub>4</sub>-biphenylene (M = Fe, Co, and Ni) catalysts are figured out and displayed in Fig. 3. Among the three calculated MN<sub>4</sub>-biphenylene catalysts, the

Fig. 3 Overpotential diagram of the ORR/OER for FeN<sub>4</sub>-biphenylene, CoN<sub>4</sub>-biphenylene and NiN<sub>4</sub>-biphenylene, respectively. Noble metal catalysts Pt(111) for the ORR and RuO2 for the OER are also included for comparison

FeN<sub>4</sub>-biphenylene catalyst has the lowest ORR (0.11 V) and OER (0.27 V) overpotentials. It is widely known that the noble metal catalysts Pt(111) and RuO2 have excellent ORR and OER catalytic performance. The overpotential for the ORR on Pt(111) is 0.45 V and the overpotential for the OER on RuO<sub>2</sub> is 0.42 V.<sup>3,4</sup> It is confirmed that the FeN<sub>4</sub>-biphenylene catalyst has a lower ORR overpotential than the catalyst Pt(111) and at the same time has a lower OER overpotential than the catalyst RuO2. In addition, the kinetic energy barriers of proton transfer for MN<sub>4</sub>-biphenylene systems are also examined. The starting position of the H atom is above the N atom. The H atom climbs over a kinetic barrier to reach the active site. The computed kinetic barriers are shown in Fig. 4 and the corresponding structures of the initial, transition, and final configuration are displayed in Fig. S3 in the ESI.† The maximum of the barriers is 0.46 eV among the four ORR steps. Such a small barrier has little influence on the catalytic reaction. Consequently, we draw the conclusion that FeN4-biphenylene is an excellent bifunctional catalyst

A natural question is how to explain the good catalytic performance of FeN<sub>4</sub>-biphenylene. For the transition metal elements Fe, Co, and Ni, which are often mentioned as candidates for single-atom catalysts, the 3d states are located around

the Fermi energy and play a dominant role in modulating the reaction rate of the ORR and OER. For the MN<sub>4</sub>-biphenylene (M = Fe, Co, and Ni), the projected density of states on the 3d orbitals of Fe, Co, and Ni atom is shown in Fig. 5, in which their d-band centers ( $\varepsilon_d$ ) are marked by the red vertical dashed lines. We can find that from Fe to Co to Ni, the center of the d-band is gradually away from the Fermi energy, which is related to the fact that the number of d electrons increases by one electron in turn from Fe to Co, to Ni.

According to the four-electron steps, the catalytic reaction is closely associated with the adsorption of the oxygenous intermediates on the catalyst. In general, the farther the d-band center is from the Fermi energy, the weaker the adsorption of the intermediates on the catalyst is. 27-29 As shown in Fig. 5, the d-band center of FeN<sub>4</sub>-biphenylene is closer to the Fermi energy than the ones of CoN<sub>4</sub>-biphenylene and NiN<sub>4</sub>-biphenylene. We can deduce that FeN<sub>4</sub>-biphenylene has a stronger adsorption capacity for intermediates compared to CoN4-biphenylene and NiN<sub>4</sub>-biphenylene, which is confirmed by the calculations of adsorption energy.

The crystal orbital Hamilton population (COHP) is an effective method to analyze the bonding information, 30 which is employed to examine the M-O bonds in the \*OH and \*OOH structures. The two intermediate phases are studied because they are the end phases of the PDS for these ORR and OER processes, and their free energies play a decisive role in the calculations of overpotentials. The negative COHP diagrams of the M-O bonds in the OH-adsorbed and OOH-adsorbed structures are shown in Fig. S2 in the ESI,† where the positive and negative values of -COHP represent the bonding and antibonding states, respectively. For the Fe-O, Co-O, and Ni-O bonds in the \*OH and \*OOH structures, the antibonding states are partially filled. The occupation of the anti-bonding state, originated from the d orbitals of the M atom and p orbitals of the O atom, can push up the energy and decrease the strength of the M-O bond. To measure the strength of the M-O bond, the integration of -COHP (-ICOHP) is calculated, 31 which is an integral of the part of the -COHP below the Fermi energy.

Fig. 6 -ICOHP of the bond M-O (M = Fe, Co, and Ni) in the composites of \*OH (a) and \*OOH (b).

A higher value of -ICOHP means a stronger bond between the active center and the intermediate. As shown in Fig. 6(a), the -ICOHP values of M-O bonds go down from Fe to Co to Ni for the composites \*OH. At the same time, a similar result is obtained for the composites \*OOH, as shown in Fig. 6(b). On the basis of the above analysis, it is concluded that the stronger the adsorption capacity of OH and OOH, the lower the overpotentials for the ORR and OER on MN<sub>4</sub>-biphenylene SACs. Consequently, FeN<sub>4</sub>-biphenylene is a good bifunctional catalyst with low overpotentials.

In summary, based on the biphenylene monolayer, we designed three kinds of MN<sub>4</sub>-biphenylene (M = Fe, Co, and Ni) single-atom catalysts, and systematically studied their structure, stability, and ORR and OER catalytic activities. And we use the dband center theory to explain why FeN<sub>4</sub>-biphenylene has better catalytic activity, which is consistent with the fact that FeN<sub>4</sub>biphenylene has a stronger adsorption ability for intermediates than the other two catalysts. In addition, we used the crystal orbital Hamiltonian population to prove that there is a stronger coupling of FeN<sub>4</sub>-biphenylene and the intermediate reactions with respect to the other two SACs. According to the free energy calculations, FeN<sub>4</sub>-biphenylene is an efficient bifunctional catalyst with overpotentials of  $\eta_{ORR} = 0.11 \text{ V}$  and  $\eta_{OER} = 0.27 \text{ V}$ . More importantly, such low overpotentials indicate that FeN<sub>4</sub>biphenylene has a higher ORR/OER catalytic activity than the well-known Pt(111) and RuO2 catalysts.

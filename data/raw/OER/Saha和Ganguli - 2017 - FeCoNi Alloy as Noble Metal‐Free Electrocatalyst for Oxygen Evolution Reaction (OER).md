# FeCoNi Alloy as Noble Metal-Free Electrocatalyst for Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER)

Soumen Saha[a] and Ashok K. Ganguli\*[a, b]

The development of efficient and durable noble metal-free electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is highly desired in polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) based water electrolysis and metal- air batteries but still remains a challenge. In this paper, we employ co-precipitation method to prepare layered double hydroxides followed by calcination to synthesize nanoalloy catalyst, which was further characterized by Xray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM/EDS), high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM)and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. As a novel OER electrocatalyst, the FeCoNi alloy catalyst shows remarkable OER activity enhancement with an overpotential of only 400 mV and a low Tafel slope 72 mV dec-. This work offers a unique paradigm for the synthesis of competitive electrocatalyst for OER with excellent durability under alkaline condition.

# Introduction

Electrochemical splitting of water to molecular oxygen is an area of technological interest owing to their growing global demand for clean and sustainable energy for the development of energy conversion and storage processes, such as water electrolysis, artificial photosynthesis, and rechargeable metal– air batteries to their high efficiency, high power density and ecofriendly nature.[1–3] The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is the anodic half reaction of water splitting, and is one of the well-studied electrochemical reactions. Similar to many other chemical reactions, electrochemical processes requires voltages in notable excess of the thermodynamic requirement of 1.23 V for water-splitting (H2O ! H2 + <sup>1</sup> =<sup>2</sup> O2), also known as overpotential in electrochemistry.[4–6] The primary issue of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is the slow kinetics[6–8] associated with it, imposing serious overpotential requirement that must be supplied at the anode, which affect the overall efficiency of the reaction. Till date, noble-metal based catalysts, such as RuO2 [9] and IrO2 [4] are considered to be the most active catalysts for OER. However they are not suitable for large-scale applications due to high cost and scarcity of noble metal based catalyst. Therefore, considerable interest has been devoted to the search of efficient electrocatalyst which can expedite the reaction rate and efficiency by reducing the barrier of overpotential making them more feasible in practical applications. These catalyst should be based on earth abundant as well as cheap materials. In response, 3d- transition-metal-based catalysts are probably a good choice alternative to noble-metalbased catalysts. Generally, oxides and hydroxides of Co, Ni, and Fe or mixtures thereof, among various 3d-metal-based catalysts, demonstrate their great potential for OER as well as activity because of their high availability in nature and theoretically high catalytic activity.[10, 11]

Previous studies have proven that each transition metal may exhibit a specific function which can manoeuvre the behavior of alloy materials in electrochemical reactions. Theoretical simulations have anticipated that the incorporated transition metals into alloys will alter the adsorption energies by changing the lattice and bond length of the crystal toward optimal catalytic activity.[12, 13] For this reason, we can predict that fabrication of more complex alloy compositions (moving from binary alloys to ternary alloys) would open more possibilities and the electrocatalytic performances have been further boosted via tuning relative metal proportion and compositions. This is due to the increase in degrees of freedom and the synergetic effects of ternary alloys compared to the binary alloys.[14, 15]

Inspired by this, we synthesized FeCoNi ternary alloy nanostructures from their LDH's precursor and applied for oxygen evolution reaction as nonprecious metal-based anode catalyst active for OER. Significant achievements have been made searching for earth abundant metals capable of substituting for noble metals in the past decade but many of them still suffer from intrinsic shortcomings like poor stability.[16] Although there are many reports for oxygen evolution reaction using Ni or Co based alloy, there is still a real need to improve the intrinsic activity and durability of the catalyst by tuning the catalyst structurally as well as, mechanically to efficiently catalyze OER reactions. For these reasons, it still remains an enormous challenge in discovery and design of cost-effective catalysts with both prominent activity with the low over-

potential (h) for efficient electrochemical evolution of molecular oxygen.

A number of physical as well as chemical methods have been employed for the synthesis of nanomaterials.[17–24] Nanostructured FeCoNi alloys have earlier been synthesized from electrodeposition,[25, 26] co-precipitation,[27] chemical vapor deposition method,[28] polyol process[29] and glycine-nitrate technique[30] are also known.

In this paper, we aim to synthesize alloy nanoparticles of FeCoNi from their from their LDH's precursors an active catalyst for enhanced oxygen evolution reaction. Synthesis of nano metal alloys via formation of two dimensional nanostructured layered double hydroxides (LDHs) is crucial because the calcined alloy species maintain the same uniform distribution of the mother structure. The uniform distribution of the metal nano alloy particles is beneficial for any catalytic reaction. Researchers have reported some studies on bimetallic catalysts prepared via LDHs. Y. Liu et al.[31] reported Cu–Co nanoparticles of Cu–Co alloy derived from layered double hydroxides and their catalytic performance for higher alcohol synthesis from syngas. Yang et al.[32] reported that uniform Co–Fe alloy nanoparticles were obtained by reducing the LDH precursors etc. Although there is one report of synthesizing ternary NiCoFe-LDH based catalyst,[33] however, to the best of our knowledge, synthesis of ternary FeCoNi alloy from its LDH precursor and their catalytic activity toward oxygen evolution reaction has not been reported.

Herein, we report for the first time the synthesis of binderfree FeCoNi alloy nanoparticles from their layered double hydroxide precursors using a facile, inexpensive and scalable method. Low overpotential, small Tafel slope along with low resistance suggest favorable electrode kinetics for the reported spherical FeCoNi alloy. Also, the alloy catalyst shows exceptional stability during prolonged oxygen evolution under constant current in highly alkaline conditions during OER activity. Potentially, our work may be utilized for the manufacturing of other binary as well as ternary alloys from their corresponding double hydroxides and these can be used as oxygen evolution reaction catalyst.

# Results and Discussion

The crystal structure of the resulting FeCoNi alloy along with other alloy nanoparticles were examined by Powder X-ray diffraction studies (Figure 1). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) peak positions as well as their relative intensities for FeCoNi alloy nanoparticles prepared from their corresponding LDHs are shown in Figure 1 and are in good accordance with the previous XRD pattern of FeCoNi alloy.[29, 30, 34] The main reflections at 2q values of 43.79, 51.04 and 75.14<sup>o</sup> could be indexed to the (111), (2 0 0), (2 2 0) planes of face-centered cubic (FCC) FeCoNi alloy.

The measured d value for the most prominent peak of FeCoNi alloy is found to be 2.065, which lies in between the average d values of pure Ni (JCPDS 89–7128, 2.040 ), pure Co (JCPDS 89–7093, 2.046 ) or Fe (JCPDS 89–4186, 2.072). This indicates the formation of fcc-FeCoNi alloy rather than individ-

ual particles of Fe, Co or Ni. Impurities or other phases (Fe, CoO, NiO, or Co(hcp)) were not observed in the XRD patterns.

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were carried out to find out the morphology of the alloy nanoparticles. Figure S1 shows the formation of spherical agglomerated nanoparticles for all the three alloys.

SEM-EDS elemental mapping (Figure 2) shows that all the elements (Fe, Co or Ni) are uniformly distributed and indicates

formation of homogeneous ternary alloy nanostructures. The Fe/Co/Ni ratio was calculated to be about 1.8: 1: 1.6 from EDX analysis (Table S1) when the target we used in the preparation had a Fe/Co/Ni ratio of 1:1:1. The SEM-EDX analysis of CoNi (Figure S2 and Table S2) and FeNi alloy (Figure S3 and Table S3) NPs were given in supporting information.

TEM characterizations were also performed to further examine the microscopic structure of all the three alloy compositions (Figure S4). We can see a homogeneous distribu-

tion of spherical particles of FeCoNi alloy nanoparticles with agglomeration shown in Figure 3a.

Clear lattice fringes with a spacing of 0.206 nm obtained from the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image can be assigned to the interplanar spacing (111) of FeCoNi alloy (Figure 3b). Selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern obtained with a series of well-defined rings could be indexed to (111), (200), and (220) planes matched with the plane obtained from the powder XRD pattern of FeCoNi ternary alloy shown in Figure 3c.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements is performed to investigate the surface chemical environment of the products in FeCoNi alloy. Based on the survey XPS spectra (Figure S5a, see Supporting Information), the ternary alloy revealed only the presence of only C, Ni, Co, Fe and slight O, no other peaks of any metal can be found. The peaks located at 706.7 and 720.4 eV in the Fe2p XPS spectrum (Figure S5b) confirmed the metallic state of Fe in FeCoNi alloy. The positions of the 2p peaks located at 853.4 and 870.7 eV for Ni 2p and 778.3 and 793.2 eV for Co are similar to those of the individual zero-valent metals (Figure S5 c-d).[35–37] Although the metal present in the alloy particles in their metallic state, the small peak presence at 711.3 eV and 724.5 is assigned for the oxidized Fe ion on alloy surface owing to the sample exposure to air shown in the supporting Figure S5b. A shoulder observed around 781.9 eV in the cobalt spectrum and the peaks located at 855.2 and 861.9 eV in the nickel spectrum is due to the formation of CoO, nickel oxides/hydroxides and satellite, respectively owing to the exposure of the sample to air (Figure S5 c-d).[37] Figure S6 shows the Raman spectrum of the all the three alloy nanoparticles where we didn't get any characteristic peaks of hydroxide/oxide.

Electrocatalytic performance was studied towards oxygen evolution reaction to understand the intrinsic catalytic activity of FeCoNi alloy nanoparticles. The electrocatalytic OER activity was first measured by linear scan voltammogram (LSV) for FeNi, CoNi and FeCoNi in 0.5 M KOH solution using a standard threeelectrode system. As shown in Figure 4a, the typical polarization curve investigated at 5 mV s-1 , presents a low overpotential of about 1.63 V for FeCoNi alloy. The ternary FeCoNi electrocatalyst produces a current density of 10 mA cm-<sup>2</sup> (Figure 4b; this particular value was chosen as it represents the current density from a device with 10% solar to hydrogen efficiency) at 1.63 V (h= 400 mV), lower than those of the binary FeNi and CoNi alloys with an overpotential of 1.66 V (h= 430 mV) and 1.76 V (h= 530 mV) mV respectively to achieve the same current density. Bare Pt has little or no activity for oxygen evolution reaction as expected within the applied potential. The anodic current rapidly goes up beyond the onset potential (where oxidative current begins at the anode i. e. where it changes from the baseline) on moving towards positive potential.

The direct comparison of the OER performance with previous results presented in this paper is quiet hard because of the varying experimental conditions used in different reports. Still, comparisons were made with some recent published results for OER, demonstrate the outstanding electrochemical performance of FeCoNi catalysts. Table 1 summarizes the detailed comparison of different active electrocatalysts in alkaline media for OER. The overpotential of the FeCoNi alloy electrode surpass all the electrocatalysts reported in this manuscript, including noble metal-based catalysts such as Ir/C (409 mV) and Pt/C (636 mV) for OER.[38] The OER activity of the synthesized FeCoNi alloy NPs is superior to many of the previously reported non-precious metal based electrodes.[38–42] Moreover, the OER activity of the as-synthesized FeCoNi electrode is even better than some other previously reported NiFe-based electrodes.[33, 43, 44] For example, Co-based catalyst Mn3O4/CoSe2 made from earth abundant element required a small overpotential value of 450 mV which is almost 50 mV more compare to our alloy catalyst to reach the same current density of 10 mA cm-. [39] In another case meso-Co3O4 shows an overpotential of 411 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA.cm<sup>2</sup> which required 11 mV more overpotential than our catalyst to reach the same current density, making our catalyst better than former one.

The OER kinetics of different alloys was understood with the help of the Tafel slope. The Tafel plot was obtained by measuring the stable current density (j) under the applied potentials (h). Figure 4c showed Tafel value of 72 mV dec-<sup>1</sup> of FeCoNi alloy which is comparable to that found in wellestablished OER catalysts such as RuO2/GC (87.1 mV dec-),[6] IrO2 (ca. 49 mV/dec).[45] The smallest Tafel slope of 72 mV dec-1 was obtained for FeCoNi alloy at low overpotential ranges, which is lower than that of FeNi (79 mV dec-) and CoNi (97 mV dec-). These lower Tafel slopes demonstrate its favorable kinetics and faster charge transfer from electrolyte to electrode for OER, which reflects on the enhancement of catalytic activity of these ternary electrocatalyst.

metal OER electrocatalyst morphology has been tabulated in Table 1.

We also observed the effect of bubble formation on the surface of FeCoNi alloy modified platinum electrode in 0.5 M

KOH solution. Three consequent OER polarization curves were recorded (Figure 4d) with the ternary alloy. The second OER polarization curve is drastically affected by the gas bubbles formed on the electrode surface after the first scan, showing a drastic decrease in the current for OER. The catalytic activity of the ternary FeCoNi/Pt electrode can be recovered only when the bubbles were removed from the surface of the electrode by subsequent argon blowing or water rinsing.[8]

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis were conducted to gain further insight into the water electrolysis (OER) activity of FeCoNi nanoalloy (Figure 5). The reason behind

Figure 5. Comparison of charge-transfer resistances; Nyquist plots of FeNi, CoNi and FeCoNi electrodes in 0.5 M KOH solution.

the high performance of FeCoNi nanoalloys was revealed by impedance spectroscopy. Charge transfer resistance (Rct) was determined by fitting the measured impedance data to an equivalent circuit and calculated from the diameter of semicircle at high frequencies and in a Nyquist curve.

The outstanding OER performance of the ternary FeCoNi alloy can be due to the electronic structure modification as well as the hydrogen adsorption energy tuning,[15, 46–48] leading to superior catalytic property and favorable electron transport. Figure 5 shows that the charge transfer resistance (Rct) of 756W for FeCoNi is much smaller than that of FeNi (11.55 kW) or CoNi (28.8 kW) alloy suggesting that the former possesses a high rate of electron transfer compared to the latter which directly relates to the OER process. The faster electron transfer is due to the synergistic effect from the multiple transition metals, as well as other factors. It is well consistent with earlier results.[49, 50]

Electroactive surface area (EASA) a very crucial parameter in electrochemistry which is proportional to the electrocatalytic activity of electrocatalyst. EASA can be calculated from doublelayer capacitance from EIS study (see supporting for detail calculation). The electroactive surface areas were found to be 0.382, 0.394 and 0.559 cm<sup>2</sup> for CoNi, FeNi and FeCoNi alloy respectively. The larger EASA value means larger enhanced electrocatalytic activity for OER, which suggest FeCoNi have most exposed active sites for oxygen evolution reaction.

Furthermore, the activity of alloy can be notably enhanced when doping third metal in the binary structure. Enhancement of conductivity as well as the electrocatalytic activity of the FeCoNi catalyst is due to the partial-charge transfer activation effect mainly induced by Fe species to activate Ni or Co in the ternary system.[43] Incorporation of third metal in the binary alloy promotes the multi-electron transportation process which leads to change of oxidation state of metal from lower to higher value. This increase in oxidation state of Ni3+/4<sup>+</sup> or Co<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> /3<sup>+</sup> having more oxidizing power are particularly critical to enable excellent catalytic stability towards OER.[58–61]

Secondly, the synergetic factor typically observed in the mixed systems is considered one of the key factors to improve the electrocatalytic activity of alloy catalyst. Geng et al. also supported the fact regarding the enhancement of electrocatalytic activity for OER iron nickel oxides and crystalline iron cobalt oxides because of the analogous partial-charge transfer effect. Many earlier researches have also revealed similar results.

Long term stability of the ternary alloy catalysts was also tested by chronopotentiometric technique where the catalyst held at constant potential of 1.63 V (vs. RHE)for 10 h and the current density remains at 10 mA cm-2 . The potential was measured vs. time and presented in Figure 6a. The stable current plotted in LSV over 10 h of chronopotentiometric operation with very small voltage fluctuations (~10 mV) confirm the high durability of the alloy electrocatalyst

The SEM mapping image collected after electrolysis experiment showed the electrode surface for OER in 0.5 M KOH (Figure 6b). The outstanding physical stability was also confirmed by SEM and XRD test after continuous 10 h of chronopotentiometric study. The SEM mapping image collected after electrolysis experiment showed that the electrode surface remained unchanged (Figure 7a) and the diffraction peaks (PXRD) of the FeCoNi alloy product match well with the respective planes of the pure FeCoNi phase (Figure 7b) even after 10 h of chronopotentiometric study confirming the structural stability of the corresponding alloy. The slight initial decay observed in the chronopotentiometric study due to the large amount of bubble formation at the electrode surface.

# Conclusions

Here, we have reported the first successful synthesis of ternary FeCoNi alloy from their layered double hydroxides precursor using an easily scalable and cost-effective wet chemical method. Our study shows that ternary FeCoNi alloy nanoparticles exhibit superior catalytic efficiency as well as strong durability for oxygen electrochemical reaction (OER) compared to FeNi or CoNi alloys.

In addition the electrochemical measurements show that enhancement of OER activity is due to the incorporation of a third transition metal into a binary alloy (increasing the degrees of freedom of alloys). The electrochemical performance of our catalyst synthesizing from earth abundant metal elements was close to noble metal based catalysts and the catalyst used as the anode could reduce the operation cost of OER. The low

overpotential and Tafel slope value also indicate that our catalyst is better than most of the non-precious metal electrocatalysts for OER reported previously as seen from Table 1. The excellent OER catalytic performance of FeCoNi nanoalloy can be attributed to the reducing charge transfer resistance between the self-supported catalytic layer and the substrate underlying. Finally, this work presents as yet another way of synthesizing ternary non-noble metal alloy as an ideal candidate for the next generation of OER catalysts which is highly active as well as low cost catalyst for OER made of earth abundant materials.

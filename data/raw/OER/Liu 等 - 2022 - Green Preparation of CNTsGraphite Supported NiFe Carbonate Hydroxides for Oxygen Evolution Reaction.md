Developing durable and highly active non-noble electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is highly desirable for water splitting. Herein, we report a NiFe carbonate hydroxides embedded in a carbon nanotubes and graphite composite material (NiFe CHs-CNT/G) by a facile and green precipitation method. The NiFe CHs are in-situ grown on CNT/G using NH3 H2O as precipitant and CO2 in air as the source of CO3 2 under room temperature and pressure. The introduction of CNT/G not only improves the conductivity of material, but also enhances the combination of CNT/G and NiFe CHs nanosheets,

thereby accelerating the transfer of electrons and reactants. Meanwhile, the catalyst with a special sandwich morphology provides larger active area to expose more active sites. Moreover, the effective interaction within the Ni and Fe in NiFe CHs-CNT/G is benefiting for improving OER performance. All these lead to the optimized NiFe CHs-CNT/G catalyst delivers an outstanding OER performance with a low overpotential of 300 mV at 10 mAcm <sup>2</sup> and a small Tafel slope of 60.13 mVdec <sup>1</sup> .

# **Introduction**

In the 21st century, environmental pollution and shortage of fossil resources are two critical problems human beings faced. Hydrogen energy is thus emerged as one kind of clean energy source to address above problems. Recently, water splitting, which involves the anode coupled with a four-electron oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the cathode with a two-electron hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), is considered as one of the most important and efficient techniques to realize the highlyefficient hydrogen generation.[1] However, it is normally restricted by the catalyst-dominated OER process. To date, traditional noble metal oxides (IrO2, RuO2, etc.) have been extensively studied due to its outstanding OER performance,[2] but have been limited by their high price and insufficient resources. It is urgent to develop cheap alternative catalysts with superior OER activity.

In general, transitional metallic compounds are more economically selective. Particularly, the elements in iron group (Ni, Fe, Co) have been extensively studied. It has been found that they often show high activity in alkaline water electrolysis, demonstrating their potential in replacing scarce metals. For example, Wei et al. prepared iron-based materials with excellent OER performance by a two-step impregnation-calcination method.[3] Acedera et al.[2c] synthesized porous cobalt-based

oxides, which showed a highly-efficient OER activity in alkaline solution. In addition, binary or ternary metal compounds were also designed and synthesized to further promote the OER performance, such as double hydroxides,[1a,4] alloy,[5] sulfides[6] etc. Wherein, the metal carbonate hydroxides (M CH) were also taken notice of researchers. The CO3 <sup>2</sup> ion can adsorb more water molecules during water splitting so as to further speed up the process of electrolysis of water compared to oxides and hydroxides.[7] Moreover, the materials have a good structural stability.[8] Zhang et al.[9] reported the existence of cobalt carbonate hydroxide hydrate on multiwall carbon nanotubes as potential OER catalyst. Cai et al.[10] used nickel iron carbonate hydroxides decorated with CeOx to obtain a highly efficient OER catalyst. Karthick et al.[11] prepared a Ni Fe carbonate hydroxides and found that the material had excellent water electrolysis performance in both neutral and alkaline electrolytes. Tang et al.[12] studied Mn doping cobalt carbonate hydroxides on nickel foam with an unprecedented activity in the OER. Dai et al. synthesized partially sulfurated ultrathin nickel-iron carbonate hydroxides nanosheet by hydrothermal method.[13] However, there is less study on the application of carbonate hydroxides in electrocatalytic water oxidation, which is due to it is difficult to synthesis nickel carbonate hydroxides with an atypical structure. Generally, M–CH is prepared by hydrothermal method or sol gel method, which is not conducive to actual production and has low yield. Thus, there still remains a big challenge to develop a simple, high-yield, and low-cost method for the preparation of M CH.

Meanwhile, the biggest limitation of carbonate hydroxide lies in its inherent poor electrical conductive. Integrating twodimensional (2D) or three-dimensional (3D) conductive substrates could be an effective way to solve the above issues.[14] Luo et al. introduced carbon nanotubes as the substrates to enhance the electrochemical properties of transition metals.[15] Fang et al. used graphene oxide as the carbon material substrate to achieve the double hydrolysis of materials.[16] In

addition, the carbon-carbon composites are also used as the substrates, and the graphite with carbon nanotubes can be assembled to form a variety of composite materials. For instance, Zou et al. used N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> to reduce CNTs and GO with a composite with a 3D CNT/G structure. [17] Liu et al. prepared CNT/CN thin films with a network structure with optimal pore size distribution by low-temperature chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method.[18] Apparently, these 3D-structured composites possess the following advantages when evaluated as OER electrocatalysts, including: 1) carbon nanotubes can be used as spacers to increase the graphite sheet distance, thus improving the transfer of reactants, [19] 2) the insertion of carbon nanotubes can be used as complementary sites in electrochemical reactions to promote the electron transfer, [20] 3) graphite sheets can be used to expose more surface area and increase abundant active sites,<sup>[21]</sup> 4) the excellent mechanical properties of graphite can guarantee the good stability of the as-prepared materials.[21]

Herein, the NiFe carbonate hydroxides was in-situ embedded in a three-dimensional (3D) composite carbon material consisting of acid-treated carbon nanotubes and graphite powder (NiFe CHs-CNT/G) by a precipitation method under room temperature and pressure. In the whole synthesis process, the NH<sub>3</sub>·H<sub>2</sub>O was used as precipitant, and the CO<sub>2</sub> in the air was used as the source of CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup>. The fabrication procedure for the

NiFe CHs-CNT/G was demonstrated in Scheme 1. Electrochemical data proved that the NiFe CHs-CNT/G material has excellent OER activity with a low overpotential of 300 mV at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> and a small Tafel slope of 60.13 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>. The preeminent OER performance could be ascribed to the following aspects: the introduction of CNT/G, the combination of NiFe CHs and CNT/G, the unique sandwich structure of NiFe CHs-CNT/G, and the interaction between Ni and Fe elements.

#### **Results and Discussion**

The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of acid-treated Graphite and CNT, CNT/G are shown in Figure 1a. As can be seen, the same diffraction peaks at 26.0° in three samples are assigned to (002) plane of hexagonal graphite, indicating that the acid-treated samples still have a graphitic structure. In Figure 1b, the similar diffraction peaks at  $2\theta$  of 26.0° for NiFe CHs-Graphite and NiFe CHs-CNT/G hybrids correspond to the (002) plane of graphite, showing that the graphite structure of prepared NiFe CHs-CNT/G is well preserved. Furthermore, the characteristic diffraction peaks appearing at  $2\theta = 31.2^\circ$  and  $42.8^\circ$  correspond to the (012) and (015) diffraction planes of Fe<sub>2</sub>(CO)<sub>3</sub>OH (JCPDS 52–0163), respectively. While the well-defined diffraction peak observed at  $2\theta = 11.9^\circ$  is indexed to the (040) plane of Ni<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub> (JCPDS 29–0868). These results show the successful synthesis of NiFe carbonate hydrates with carbon substrates.

The FT-IR spectra of acid-treated Graphite, CNT, CNT/G, and NiFe CHS-CNT/G are shown in Figure 2a. As can be seen, the peaks at around 3424 cm $^{-1}$ , 1370 cm $^{-1}$ , 1030 cm $^{-1}$  correspond to the –OH, –O–C=O, –C–O, respectively, proving that the Graphite, CNT, CNT/G were successfully acidified. However, only graphite has the weakest peak, which is due to the inert nature of graphite which makes it difficult to be oxidized. The results of the abundant oxygen-containing groups are generated by acid treatment, which can be used to coordinate with Ni $^{2+}$ /Fe $^{3+}$  ions more strongly. In the FT-IR spectrum of the NiFe CHs-CNT/G, the intensity of all resultant peaks of these oxygenated functional groups hardly changed. In addition to inheriting the infrared characteristic peak of the base, NiFe CHs-CNT/G also has two weak absorption peaks at around  $\approx$  660 and  $\approx$  841 cm $^{-1}$  (Figure S1), which are attributed to M–O, M–O-

M, O–M-O lattice vibrations (M=Ni and Fe). Obviously, it provides strong evidence for the existence of Ni and Fe ions in samples. Besides, the presence of  $CO_3^{2-}$  was evidenced by the peaks at 1529 cm<sup>-1</sup>.<sup>[24]</sup>

The Raman spectrum in Figure 2b shows the characteristic D and G bands of different samples. Generally speaking, the intensity ratio ( $I_D/I_G$ ) of the D–G band is used to evaluate the degree of structural defects and disordered structures of carbonaceous material. The  $I_D/I_G$  ratio increases from CNT/G (1.09) to NiFe CHs-CNT/G (1.24), which is due to the combination of NiFe CHs with CNT/G likely increases the disorder degree and number of defects of the graphite. In fact, more defects and disordered graphite structures are benefiting to improve the OER performance of NiFe CHs-CNT/G. $^{(20)}$ 

To evaluate the permanent porosity and specific surface area of the samples, the nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms and corresponding pore size distribution of the asprepared materials are carried out in Figure 2c–2d. The shape of the isotherm for NiFe CHs–CNT/G and CNT/G can be classified as the type IV isotherm, standing for mesoporous materials. Apparently, the NiFe CHs–CNT/G hybrid has a high BET surface area of 102.3 m²g⁻¹, which is larger than that of CNT/G (49.26 m²g⁻¹). Moreover, the NiFe CHs-CNT/G has a cumulative pore volumes of 0.32 cm³g⁻¹ and an average pore size of 15.4 nm. The larger surface area and proper pore size can expose more active sites for efficient adsorption and activation of reactive molecules and allow their fast migration, thus improving the OER performance. [25]

The compositions and surface electronic states of the asmade NiFe CHs-CNT/G are further investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and all of the peaks are labeled

and revealed the existence of C, Ni, Fe, and O in inset of Figure 3a. The fine-resolution XPS of C 1s is divided into five different types: C-C, C-O, C=O, O-C=O, and M-CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup>, corresponding to the peaks at 284.6, 285.0, 286.2, 288.7, and 289.6 eV, [26] respectively. For the high-resolution O 1s spectrum (Figure 3b), the peaks at 532.5, 532.4, and 531.3 eV can be attributed to water molecules adsorbed on the nanosheet surface, –OH, M–CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2–</sup>, respectively. [9,11–12] The existence of –OH and M-CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup> illustrate that the carbonate hydroxides are successfully synthesized. For the high-resolution Fe 2p spectrum of NiFe CHs-CNT/G nanosheets (Figure 3d), along with two peaks at 711.7 and 729.7 eV are assigned to Fe 2p<sub>3/2</sub> and Fe 2p<sub>1/2</sub> <sub>2</sub>, respectively, which are typical values of Fe<sup>3+</sup>. Otherwise, Figure 3c shows the high-resolution spectrum of Ni 2p, the two peaks at 856.1 and 873.7 eV are related to the Ni 2p<sub>3/2</sub> and Ni 2p<sub>1/2</sub>, indicating that Ni<sup>2+</sup> is exists in NiFe CHs-CNT/G, in the other hands, accompanying with two satellite peaks located at 880.7 and 860.8 eV in the respective Ni  $2p_{1/2}$  and Ni  $2p_{3/2}$ regions.[28] These results meaning that NiFe CHs are successfully synthesized, and the carbonate hydroxides structure can adsorb more water molecules during water splitting so as to further speed up the process of electrolysis of water.

The morphologies of NiFe CHs-CNT/G sample are investigated by scanning electron microscope (SEM) images. We can clearly see that the NiFe CHs-CNT/G composites form a sandwich-like structure as shown in Figure 4a–4c. The transmission electron microscope (TEM) images in Figure 4d–4e, further confirm the sandwich structure of NiFe CHs-CNT/G. The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images of the NiFe CHs-CNT/G are shown in Figure 4f, and there possesses three sets of lattice fringes. Among them, the

interlayer distances of 2.34 and 7.49 Å correspond to the (015) and (003) crystal planes of the  $Fe_2(CO)_3OH$  phase, respectively, and the interlayer distances of 3.23 Å correspond to the (001) crystal planes of  $Ni_2CO_3(OH)_2$ . The high-angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) image is exhibited in Figure 4g to evaluate the element distribution of NiFe CHs-CNT/G composites, and corresponding EDX mapping images of C, Ni, Fe, and O show that the Ni, Fe, and O have a highly overlapped elements distribution, indicating that there is no interface between  $Fe_2(CO_3)(OH)$  and  $Ni_2(CO_3)(OH)_2$  and the two metals exist in a mixed state. Besides, the existence

range of C element overlaps with that of carbon materials and is larger than that of metal.

As shown in Figure S2a, the morphology of CNT/G is that CNTs are interspersed in graphite sheets forming a three-dimensional structure, while the NiFe CHs show a relatively thick and large flake morphology (Figure S2b). As to the NiFe CHs-CNT/G, the graphite sheets and NiFe CHs are superimposed together, with CNTs inserted into them, to form a sandwich composite (Figure 4a–c). In addition, the morphology of Fe CH-CNT/G and Ni CH-CNT/G as shown in Figure S2c–S2d also exhibits the similar sandwich structure, which indicates the consistency of the material morphology. Therefore, we spec-

ulate that the reaction mechanism is as follows: The acid-treated CNTs/G are dispersed in water in the first step. After adding Ni<sup>2+</sup> and Fe<sup>3+</sup>, the metal ions can adsorb on the surface of CNT/G through electrostatic interactions, the NH<sub>3</sub>·H<sub>2</sub>O is used as precipitant, and the CO<sub>2</sub> in the air is used as the source of  ${\rm CO_3}^{2-}$  during the following stirring reaction to form a NiFe CHs-CNT/G hybrid.

To evaluate the OER activity of NiFe CHs-CNT/G and the other referential samples (NiFe CHs-CNT, NiFe CHs-G, NiFe CHs-CNT/G (Without-AcT), NiFe CHs-CNT/G), electrocatalytic activity measurements are performed in 1 M KOH solution by linear sweep voltammograms (LSV) shown in Figure 5a. The overpotential of NiFe CHs-CNT/G, NiFe CHs-CNT, NiFe CHs-G, NiFe CHs-CNT/G (Without-AcT), NiFe CHs, and CNT/G are estimated to be 300, 329, 357, 368, and 456 mV at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, respectively. As can be seen, CNT/G hardly has OER activity because it is inert property. Meanwhile, NiFe CHs has certain OER performance. However, due to the poor electrical conductivity of the M-CH, the CNT/G is introduced as substrate. Apparently, the OER performance of the material has been significantly improved by about 68 mV. At the same time, in order to highlight the advantages of hybrid carbon materials, NiFe CHs-CNT and NiFe CHs-G are prepared by the same method. Obviously, the OER activity is not as high as that of NiFe CHs-CNT/G, the 3D sandwich structure can expose more active sites during the reaction, and the carbon nanotubes can be used as spacers to increase the graphite sheet distance, thus improving the transfer of reactants to promote OER activity. Meanwhile, the MWCNTs also serve as a binder to hold the graphite together preventing disintegration of the 3D sandwich into the electrolyte. Moreover, they can enhance electrical

conduction for the electrons. This indicated that the 3D sandwich structure of the material is obviously beneficial to improve the OER performance of the catalyst. Besides, the OER activity of NiFe CHs—CNT/G (Without-AcT) is obviously lower than that of NiFe CHs-CNT/G, which may be due to the acid treatment for CNT/G provides more anchor sites to fix NiFe CHs, and the close integration and interaction between NiFe CHs and CNT/G may improve the OER activity of the catalyst. In addition, in order to confirm that the OER performance of the target catalyst is reproducible and convincible, the corresponding NiFe CHs-CNT/G samples are repeatedly prepared and compared the OER performance in Figure S8. And the average overpotential of NiFe CHs—CNT/G at 10 mAcm—2 is about 297 mV, which is similar with the original samples.

The Tafel slope is an important factor to evaluate the OER kinetics of materials. As shown in Figure 5b, it has the same law as the LSV curve, the Tafel slope of NiFe CHs–CNT/G is 60.13 mVdec<sup>-1</sup>, which is lowest among that of NiFe CHs (84.07 mVdec<sup>-1</sup>), NiFe CHs-CNT (74.84 mVdec<sup>-1</sup>), NiFe CHs-G (83.61 mVdec<sup>-1</sup>), and NiFe CHs-CNT/G (Without-AcT) (78.13 mVdec<sup>-1</sup>), demonstrating that the target catalysts own favorable OER kinetics.

In addition, the electrochemical double-layer capacitances ( $C_{dl}$ ) is adopted to estimate the electrochemically active surface areas (ESCA) of catalysts due to the positive correlation relation between them.<sup>[29]</sup> The  $C_{dl}$  of NiFe CHs-CNT/G, NiFe CHs, NiFe CHs-CNT, NiFe CHs-G, NiFe CHs-CNT/G (Without-AcT), and CNT/G are displayed in Figure 5c corresponding to 6.47, 3.57 0.7, 4.04, and 2.68 mF cm<sup>-2</sup> respectively. It can be seen that NiFe CHs-CNT/G has the largest  $C_{dl}$  value. Combined to BET results, the special 3D sandwich morphology of material not only

provides a larger surface area, but also affords a larger ESCA, this may be due to that the presence of CNT will stretch/delaminate the graphite layer, resulting in increasing in surface aera

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) reveals the high frequency series resistance ( $R_{\rm s}$ ) and the lower frequency charge transfer resistance ( $R_{\rm ct}$ ), which are used to describe the electrochemical performance of catalysts.  $R_{\rm ct}$  is related to the electron transfer rate between the catalysts and electrolyte. Generally, using the semi-circular diameter at low frequency to indicate the electron transfer rate. The smaller radius along with the faster the electronic transfer rate. Figure 5d shows the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of difference samples. Among them, the NiFe CHs-CNT/G exhibits a lower  $R_{\rm ct}$  than other samples, it proves that the introduction of hybrid CNT/G material not only leads to more exposed active sites but also has excellent the electron transport rate, which greatly improved the OER performance of the catalyst.

Furthermore, in order to study the advantages of the bimetallic catalysts, the electrochemical performance of NiFe CHs-CNT/G, Fe CH-CNT/G, and Ni CH-CNT/G are contrasted in the same condition. The NiFe CHs-CNT/G composite apparently exhibits significantly better OER performance. The overpotential of NiFe CHs-CNT/G, Fe CH-CNT/G, and Ni CH-CNT/G are estimated to be 300, 368, and 449 mV at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> (Figure 6a), respectively. The Tafel slope of NiFe CHs-CNT/G is 60.13 mV dec<sup>-1</sup> (Figure 6b), which is much lower than that of the Fe CH-CNT/G (122.58 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>) and Ni CH-CNT/G (85.38 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>). Meanwhile, the NiFe CHs—CNT/G (Figure 6c) had a higher  $C_{dl}$  (6.57 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>) than that of Fe CH-CNT/G (6.08 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>) and Ni CH–CNT/G (2.38 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>). As shown in Figure 6d, the NiFe CHs-CNT/G has a much lower impedance, indicating that it has a rapider charge-transfer kinetics relative to Fe CH-CNT/G and Ni CH-CNT/G. All of these indicating that the effective interaction within the Ni and Fe in NiFe CHs—CNT/ G is benefiting for improving OER performance.

To acquire the optimum catalyst, metal molar ratio of Ni to Fe and the amount of CNT/G supports as conditions have been screened. Along with the increase of the amount of CNT/G (Figure S5a–S5d), the activity of OER showed a volcanic trend, indicating that there is an optimal amount of CNT/G to hybrid carbon materials to achieve the best OER performance, which the best performance of OER is that the amount of CNT/G 40 mg. The OER activity of the catalysts with different molar ratios of Ni to Fe also exhibited a volcanic trend. With the increase of the molar mass of Ni ions, the OER activity of the catalysts first increase and then decrease, which the best OER performance of the NiFe CHs—CNT/G is the ratio of Ni to Fe as 1:1 (Figure S6a–S6d).

A qualified catalyst not only requires excellent catalytic performance, but also possesses favorable stability. To evaluate the durability of the catalyst, the chronoamperometry (CA) measurement curves of NiFe CHs-CNT/G are operated at 1.55 vs. RHE. As is exhibited in Figure 7, the NiFe CHs-CNT/G electrode maintains a stabled current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> for about 10 h of electrocatalysis, thus indicating the preeminent durability of the NiFe CHs-CNT/G composites.

In addition, the structure and morphology of the samples after long-term OER measurement were examined by XRD, XPS and SEM characterizations in Figure S7. In XRD pattern (Figure S7a), the new characteristic diffraction peaks belong to NiOOH (JCPDS 06–0075) and FeOOH (JCPDS 81–0464). Furthermore, the remaining peaks are nicely attributed to  $\rm Ni_2CO_3(OH)_2$  (JCPDS 29–0868). Also, the divided peak positions in high-resolution Ni  $\rm 2p_{3/2}$  and Fe  $\rm 2p_{3/2}$  (Figure S7c–d) spectra of NiFe CHs-CNT/G after long-term OER test all shift toward lower energy, indicating a decreased valence state with the pristine ones. [30] The low-valent Ni is easily oxidized to the high-valent

state, which can enhance the OER activity of catalysts.<sup>[31]</sup> The above results suggest that the NiFe CHs-CNT/G have been converted to their corresponding metal oxy-hydroxide during the OER process. However, the material underwent cracking on the morphological surface after a long stability test (Figure S7b). This may be due to the mechanical deformation and material expansion caused by the volume change of the nickel-based OER electrocatalyst in the long-term reversible Ni II-to-Ni III redox reaction.<sup>[13,32]</sup>

## Conclusion

In this study, NiFe CHs—CNT/G catalyst with high efficient OER performance was synthesized by a precipitation method under the room temperature and pressure. Firstly, the introduction of CNT/G not only contributes to enhance the conductivity of material, but also affords anchor sites to combine NiFe CHs nanosheets and CNT/G tightly, thus enhancing the transfer of electrons and reactants rates. Secondly, the sandwich nanostructure of material provides more surface area to expose more active sites. In addition, the efficient interaction within the Ni and Fe element is beneficial to enhance the catalytic activity. In summary, this catalyst exhibits good OER activity in alkaline media, providing a new thought for the design and preparation of such catalysts.

In this work, 2.7 g MWCNTs and 1.3 g Graphite powder (2:1(m/m)) were immersed in mix of 320 mL  $\rm H_2O$  in room temperature for 12 h, Carbon nanotubes and Graphite were physically mixed without acid treatment, and the remaining experimental steps were similar as CNT/G and NiFe CHs-CNT/G to obtain the product NiFe CHs-CNT/G-without acid treatment (NiFe CHs-CNT/G-without AcT).

# **Electrochemical Measurements**

The electrochemical experimental performance was obtained through the electrochemical workstation (CHI 660E, Shanghai Chenhua) using traditional three-electrode system at room temperature in which carbon rod was used as the counter electrode, Ag/AgCl was used as the reference electrode, and the other electrode was a glassy carbon working electrode with 3 mm diameter. In addition, 4 mg of the catalyst was dispersed in 1 mL of 1:1 (v/v) ethanol-water mixed solvent and 30  $\mu$ L Nafion (0.5 wt%) solution and sonicated about 30 minutes. whereafter, 5  $\mu$ L of well dispersed ink was dropped on the working electrode polished (catalyst loading 0.285 mg cm $^{-2}$ ), and dried at room temperature. In this work, we convert potential (vs. Ag/AgCl) to reversible hydrogen electrode according to Nernst equation [Eq. (1)]. [66]

$$E_{RHE} = E_{Ag|AgCl} + 0.197 + 0.059 \times pH$$

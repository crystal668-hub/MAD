Development of robust alkaline oxygen evolution reaction electrocatalysts is crucial for the efficiency of water splitting. Herein, Fe-MOF nanocones array on nickel foam are synthesized by introducing sodium hypochlorite, leading to Cl substitution of terephthalic acid in Fe-MOFs (Fe-MOF-Cl/NF). Experimental results show that Fe-MOF-Cl/NF exhibits enhanced OER activity over Fe-MOF/NF, lowering  $\eta_{50}$  from 292.4 to 222.7 mV. In combination with density function theory calculations, the improved OER performance is attributed to engineering electronic structure of Fe sites which accelerate the third step from \*O to \*OOH, and promote OER kinetics. Additionally, Fe-MOF-Cl/NF can retain catalytic activity for 100 h.

To address the ever worsening issue of global warming and environmental pollution caused by increased consumption of fossil fuels sources, significant reduction in emission of green-house gases, carbon dioxide in particular, is required. As a promising energy carrier to replace fossil fuels, hydrogen possesses high gravimetric energy density without emitting pollutants and carbon dioxide when releasing energy, and plays a key role in deep decarbonization necessary. Alternatively, water electrolysis is an appealing approach for mass production of high purity hydrogen, converting unreliable and intermittent renewable energies from nature into hydrogen fuel. Nevertheless, the bottleneck of overall water electrolysis lies in the OER on the anode, owing to a complex four-step proton coupled electron transfer process. In this regard, great attention has been directed to develop efficient and stable noble-metal-free OER electrocatalysts to address this challenge.

Recently, MOFs as self-assemblies of metal ions and organic ligands have being vigorously studied and emerged as promising platforms to construct highly efficient OER electrocatalysts. 13-15 Despite the great promise, the intrinsic instability and insulativity of MOFs present a fundamental obstacle for their applications in electrochemical water splitting. 16 To address this problem, some researchers try to introduce metal ions to augment their electrochemical performance.<sup>17</sup> Several types of monometallic or bimetallic MOFs have been studied in alkaline media. 18,19 Among these, Fe ions as active sites, can not only significantly enhance the electrical conductivity of the MOFs, but also evidently improve the activity of the catalysts.<sup>20,21</sup> Nevertheless, their OER performance is quite far from satisfactory. As we know, modifying electronic structure of the metal sites has been reported to effectively upgrade their OER performance. 22,23 For instance, Co-engineered Cu<sub>7</sub>S<sub>4</sub> nanodisks exhibit highly efficient electrocatalyst for OER, attributed to the optimized electronic structure of the active center.<sup>24</sup> And, regulating the electronic properties of Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> could improve the catalytic activity.<sup>25</sup> Considering the strong synergistic effects of metal ions and organic ligands, modifying electronic structure of metal sites via linker substitution is anticipated to be an effective strategy to optimize the catalytic activity of metal ions, thus achieving notable enhancements in electrocatalytic activities of the hosting MOFs.

Herein, Fe-MOF-Cl nanocones array on nickel foam has been successfully synthesized via a facile solvothermal method of aqueous Fe<sup>3+</sup>, TPA and sodium hypochlorite solution (see Fig. 1a). The achieved Fe-MOF-Cl/NF exhibits low overpotentials

of only 222.7 and 243.9 mV at 50 and 100 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> and tafel slope of 42 mV dec<sup>-1</sup> in 1 M KOH. DFT calculations con-firm that the modifying electronic structure of Fe sites endow Fe-MOF-Cl/NF with promoted the electron transfer and intermediate transformation, thereby improving OER performance. Importantly, it is also excellent in durability with its catalytic activity being maintained for at least 100 h.

#### Discussion

Figures 1b and S1 (available online at stacks.iop.org/JES/168/ 126508/mmedia) show the powdered X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns of the Fe-MOF-Cl/NF and Fe-MOF/NF catalysts, respectively. All the diffraction peaks are indexed to MIL-53 structure.<sup>26</sup> Moreover, the Fe-MOF/NF also shows the same diffraction pattern, indicating that Cl substitution part of TPA does not change the dominant configuration of the crystal of the Fe-MOF. As evident from Fig. 1c, the Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) and 500 cm<sup>-1</sup>. Two vigoroso absorption peaks at 1377 and 1585 cm<sup>-1</sup> are distributed to antisymmetric and symmetric O-C=O stretching ways, respectively. The two peaks at 3422 and 748 cm<sup>-1</sup> corresponding to the O-H stretching ways and C-H bonding vibrations on the benzene rings. Moreover, the appearance of  $\nu$  (Fe-O) at 543 cm<sup>-1</sup> indicates that metal-oxygen bond is formed between the Fe atoms and carboxylic. 27,28 Of especial interest to note is the relative intensity of the absorption peak of  $\nu$  (Fe-O) decreases with Cl substitution of TPA (Fig. S2). Additionally, the molecular structure of Fe-MOF-Cl/NF is further verified by Raman spectroscopy (Fig. S3a). It is established that both of two bands at 1420 and 1605 cm<sup>-1</sup> are assigned to the stretching mode of the carboxylate group. And, the bands at 860, 810 and 629 cm<sup>-1</sup> are contributed to the C-H band.<sup>29</sup> Fe-MOF-Cl/NF and Fe-MOF/NF possess similar feature bands (Fig. S3b), being in good agreement to the XRD results. The thermal behaviour of Fe-MOF-Cl/NF is investigated by TG measurements (Fig. S4). The major weight loss between 0 and 400 °C can be assigned to desorption of the residual solvent in the gaseous form. The subsequent small weight loss started about 400 °C, which is due to the fragmentation of chemical bond.<sup>30</sup> Figures 1d and 1e reveal the High-resolution TEM (HRTEM) and top-view Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of Fe-MOF-Cl/ NF, indicating full coverage of the surface of NF with dense nanocones with sharp tips, unsimilar to Fe-MOF/NF nanosheets (Fig. S5). By comparing the spectrum of energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) and corresponding elemental mapping images of Fe-MOF-Cl/NF and Fe-MOF/NF, it is found that the presence of O, C and Fe elements uniformly distribute in the resulting MOF product, while Fe-MOF-Cl/ NF shows the existence of chlorine element coming from sodium

hypochlorite (Figs. 1f and S6). After the Cl substitution of TPA, the Fe and Cl elemental contents of Fe-MOF-Cl/NF increase rapidly, elevating the contents 0.27% and 0.0% to 2.4% and 0.06%, and the elemental contents of C and O decrease slightly, which means that the introduction of sodium hypochlorite makes it easier to assemble Fe and Cl into the MOFs.

The detailed X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) investigation is performed to study the effect of Cl substitution of TPA in improving the OER performance of Fe-MOF/NF. The presence of Fe, Cl, O, and C elements in Fe-MOF-Cl/NF can be validated in Fig. S7, agreeing well with the EDS results. For C, the Fe-MOF-Cl/NF has three C 1 s peaks at 284.3, 285.6 and 288.4 eV, which belong to the C-H bond in aromatic rings, the C-O and O-C-O bond from

benzoate anions, respectively (Fig. 2a).<sup>31</sup> And, the O 1 s spectra shown in Fig. 2b exhibits typical metal-oxygen bonds (531.03 eV), the C=O bond (533.2 eV) and C-O-H bond (532.3 eV), owing to the coordination between the group of TPA linkers and absorbed molecular water.<sup>32</sup> As to Fe 2p<sub>1/2</sub> and Fe 2p<sub>3/2</sub> in Fig. 2c, the binding energies are 709.9 and 723.2 eV, respectively, accompanied by a satellite peak of Fe 2p<sub>3/2</sub> at 714.6 eV, suggesting the existence of Fe<sup>3+</sup> in the Fe-MOF-Cl/NF sample.<sup>33-35</sup> After the Cl substitution of TPA, the two peaks at 198.2 (Cl 2p<sub>3/2</sub>) and 199.2 eV (Cl 2p<sub>1/2</sub>) confirm the interior existing in the form of Cl<sup>-</sup> ions similar to the FeCl<sub>3</sub> in Fig. 2d.<sup>36,37</sup> Compared with the Fe-MOF sample, there are down shift of binding energies of 2.1–2.6 eV in the Fe 2p spectra, demonstrating an increase in electron density on Fe sites (Fig. S8).

These observations maybe come from the modification of the skeleton of Fe-MOF through introducing sodium hypochlorite. One possible mechanism is outlined below. First of all, Fe-MOF-Cl/NF exhibits an isostructure of a previously reported Fe-MOF. Six O atoms are octahedral with iron ions, forming octahedral FeO<sub>6</sub>. <sup>38,39</sup> And, the six O atoms are from the carboxylate groups of the ligand (TPA). Then, the octahedral FeO<sub>6</sub> clusters are connected through TPA ligands to form 3D crystalline structure of the MOFs. Simultaneously, as evident from IR, EDX and XPS analysis, some of the O atoms in the octahedral FeO<sub>6</sub> clusters are replaced by Cl atoms to form the Fe-Cl coordinate bonds (Fig. 2e). It is note that the Cl atoms have a lower electronegativity as compared with that of O atoms, resulting in the following electron redistribution. Fe sites pull electrons from the Cl linkers, suggesting more electrons accepted,

agreeing well with DFT results. Therefore, this observation strongly elucidates that the Cl substitution of TPA can trigger charge transfer and increase electron density of Fe sites, caused by the modification of the skeleton of MOFs. As in general, the increase of electron density of metal centers can effectively regulate the OER performance, which is in good agreement with the low tafel slope and low overpotential of Fe-MOF-Cl/NF.

The OER performance of Fe-MOF-Cl/NF is evaluated by a typical three electrode setup in a 1 M KOH. All the overpotentials are given with iR-compensation. The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves presented in Figs. 3a and 3b show that Fe-MOF-Cl/NF has the best OER catalytic activity. At ultralow overpotential is requisited to provide current densities of 50 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> ( $\eta_{50} = 222.7$  mV) and 100 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> ( $\eta_{100} = 243.9$  mV), outperforming

those of Fe-MOF/NF ( $\eta_{50}=292.4~\text{mV}$  and  $\eta_{100}=314.6~\text{mV}$ ) and the benchmarks RuO<sub>2</sub>/NF ( $\eta_{50}=274.7~\text{mV}$  and  $\eta_{100}=295.2~\text{mV}$ ). Subsequently, the effect of the concentration of sodium hypochlorite is investigated. When the concentration is 1 mM, the prepared Fe-MOF-Cl/NF displays the best activity for OER (Fig. S9). To our best knowledge, Fe-MOF-Cl/NF compares favourably to most of the recently reported non-noble-metal catalysts, and is among the state of the art OER catalysts. A more detailed comparison is listed in the Supporting Information, Table SI. In addition, the additional peak at about 1.4 V vs RHE is attributed to oxidation of metals species (M-OH to M-OOH). As depicted in Fig. S10, cyclic voltammograms (CVs) data are first collected to rationally explained the OER

mechanism by the existence of two pairs of redox peaks. <sup>40</sup> In the forward half cycle, these two oxide peaks are also observed at 0.55 and 0.62 V vs RHE for the oxidation of Fe<sup>2+</sup> to Fe<sup>3+</sup> and then reoxidized to Fe<sup>4+</sup>, severally. Moreover, in the reduction half cycle, the peaks located at 0.38 and 0.51 V vs RHE could be ascribed to the reduction of Fe<sup>4+</sup> to Fe<sup>3+</sup> and then reduction again to Fe<sup>2+</sup>. Thus, Fe metal centers serve as the active sites in the as-prepared Fe-MOF-Cl/NF. As displayed in Fig. 3c, Fe-MOF-Cl/NF demonstrates a minimum tafel slope of 54.7 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>, which is lower than Fe-MOF/NF (92 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>) and RuO<sub>2</sub>/NF (72 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>), suggesting more favorable kinetics and superior catalytic activity. The lower tafel slope of the material is due to the pore structure of Fe-MOF-Cl/

NF after the introduction of hypochlorous acid, giving the material a more excellent structural advantage and thus a faster charge transfer power. 41,42 This is consistent with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Fe-MOF-Cl/NF has a smaller semicircular diameter and higher slope than that of Fe-MOF/NF, which implies fast charge-transfer kinetics during the electrochemical reaction (Fig. 3d). These results are consistent with the calculated results by DFT. Meanwhile, Fig. 3e illustrates a multi-step chronopotentiometry curve of Fe-MOF-Cl/NF. The current density at the begining is leveled out as 4 mA  $cm^{-2}$  with the potential at 0.53 V vs RHE. Each increasing a step, with the duration of 500 s, shows the stability at the current changes, verifying distinguished mechanical robustness, electroconductibility, and large-scale transport for the OER. For practical application in mass alkaline water splitting, the catalyst under catalytic conditions should stay stable. Therefore, the stability test of catalysts is proceed in chronoamperometric mode for Fe-MOF-Cl/NF, shown in Fig. 3f. After 100 h of reaction, the current remains constant without any obvious decay during OER process, validating the superior long-duration stability of Fe-MOF-Cl/NF. Subsequently, Fig. S11 shows the LSV curve of Fe-MOF-Cl/NF after 500 CV cycles, which is almost no change relative to the initial LSV curve, further confirming the outstanding stability of the sample. After the stability test, the nanocones morphology of Fe-MOF-Cl/NF is maintained (Fig. S12). In addition, it can be seen from Fig. S13 that XPS of each element does not change significantly before and after OER test, indicating that the material has good stability.

The electrochemically active surface area (ESCA) is calculated via the measured double-layer capacitance ( $C_{\rm dl}$ ) determined by CV

with different scan rates, which can evaluate intrinsic activity corresponding to the active site of OER electrocatalysts (Figs. 4a and S14).  $^{43,44}$  As presented in Fig. 4b, Fe-MOF-Cl/NF possesses the  $C_{dl}$ of 7.84 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>, being larger than that of Fe-MOF (5.35 mF cm<sup>-2</sup> implying more active sites. BET test was carried out on the material. As can be seen from Fig. S15, the BET of Fe-MOF-CI/NF  $(963.48 \text{ m}^2 \text{ g}^{-1})$  is higher than that of Fe-MOF/NF (255.63 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>), indicating that Fe-MOF-Cl/NF has higher specific surface area and channels. More catalytic active sites can be provided. Generally, the turnover frequency (TOF) is also an important factor to influence the inherent catalytic performance of catalytic, which can be determined by the quantity of produced oxygen molecule each active site per second. A series of CVs for Fe-MOF-Cl/NF indicate that the oxidation peak currents have linear relationship with scan rates (Fig. S16). The TOF of Fe-MOF-Cl/NF is calculated to be 0.10 s<sup>-1</sup> while that the Fe-MOF is only 0.03 mol  $O_2$  s<sup>-1</sup> at overpotential of 250 mV (Fig. 4c), implying Fe-MOF-Cl/NF has better intrinsic OER activity. And the Faraday efficiency (FE) values for Fe-MOF-Cl/NF and Fe-MOF/NF are close to 100%. The results indicate that the high currents are almost entirely originated from O<sub>2</sub> evolution and not form other appreciable side reactions during the OER (Fig. 4d). Taking together from above results, the Fe-MOF-CI/NF presents lower OER overpotential and higher intrinsic OER activity compared with Fe-MOF-Cl/NF. Thus, the Cl substitution of TPA via addition sodium hypochlorite is an effective way to improve OER activity and stability for MOFs.

To elucidate the intrinsic influence of the electronic environment of Fe sites in Fe-MOF-Cl on improving the OER performance, DFT calculations are performed to get in-depth understanding of the OER

catalytic mechanisms. Here the simulation models of Fe-MOFs and Fe-MOF-Cl are constructed according to the analysis results (Fig. 2e).  $^{37,38}$  For the two models, the Fe sites are regarded as the OER catalytic center.  $^{40}$  As shown in Fig. 5a, the differential charge densities of Fe-MOF-Cl displays the intense electron interactions between Fe and surrounding ligands, resulting in the charge redistribution on the Fe-MOF-Cl interface compared with Fe-MOF. Based on the Bader charge analysis, the partial charge of Fe sites decreases from +1.45|e| in Fe-MOF to +1.41|e| in Fe-MOF-Cl. For comparison, the Cl anion in Fe-MOF-Cl possesses a lower negative charge of -0.49|e|. Accordingly, the direction of electron transfer is from Cl to Fe, resulting in the increase of electron density on Fe sites.

To discern the nature of the electronic structures, the density of states (DOS) of Fe-MOF-Cl and Fe-MOF are shown in Figs. 5b and S17. It can be obviously seen that the DOS of both samples around Fermi level are continuous, suggesting their intrinsic metallic character, but the incorporation of Cl apparently alters the DOS of Fe-MOF. Besides, Fe-MOF-Cl reveals higher DOS near the Fermi level (in the energy range of -1-+1 eV) than that of Fe-MOF, indicating faster transfer of electrons and thereby enhanced OER activity. Subsequently, Fig. 5c further display the chemisorption models with different oxygen-contained intermediates (H<sub>2</sub>O and \*OH, \*O, and \*OOH ) on the surface of Fe-MOF-Cl. According to the Gibbs free energy profiles of different steps for Fe-MOF-Cl and Fe-MOF, the third step from \*O to \*OOH is found to be the rate determining step (RDS) for all the samples (Figs. 5d and S18). The RDS of Fe-MOF-Cl has an energy barrier of 2.02 eV, which is approximately 0.08 eV lower than that on Fe-MOF (2.10 eV), and implying a faster electrochemical kinetics. Combining the above results, it is concluded that the role of Cl substitution of TPA is to change the electronic structure of Fe sites, which triggers easy charge transfer and decreases RDS energy. Thus we speculate that the improved OER catalytic activity of Fe-MOF-Cl/NF is due to the most favorable electronic configuration among these samples.

### **Summary**

In summary, by introducing sodium hypochlorite, Fe-MOF-Cl/NF achieves both ultrahigh activity and stability for OER in alkaline solutions with the low overpotentials of 222.7 and 243.9 mV at 50 and 100 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> as well as maintains with long term stability of at least 100 h without decay, representing one of the best MOFs catalyst as we know. Experimental and theoretical analysis have revealed the electronic structure of Fe sites by Cl substitution of the organic ligand (TPA) in Fe-MOFs after introducing sodium hypochlorite, which provide decreased energetic barriers for the rate-determining step to form \*OOH, thus facilitates the OER property. Evidently, this ingenious method has great potential to be developed as a facile route to expand the toolbox for regulating electronic structure of MOFs, further guiding us to prepare more active electrocatalyst and beyond.

Abstract: Iron-cobalt phosphomolybdate (FeCoPM<sub>12</sub>) nanoparticles, a high-efficient catalytic material for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), were fabricated via a coprecipitation route. Compared with iron-cobalt hydroxide and state-of-art RuO<sub>2</sub> electrocatalysts, the as-prepared FeCoPM<sub>12</sub> sample exhibited robust OER catalytic activity with a low overpotential of 258 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> and a small Tafel slope of 33 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>. Moreover, the as-synthesized sample presented preferable stability, and after 10 h at 1.52 V, the current density merely degrades 8.3 percent. It's ascribed to the high electrochemical stability and small porous structure of FeCoPM<sub>12</sub> material, which provide effective electron transmission and improve the catalytic performance for OER in alkaline medium

#### Introduction

With the increasing energy demand in industrial economy and the serious environmental pollution, the clean energy from water splitting has been widely paid attention. The electrolysis of water to generate hydrogen and oxygen is an appealing and sustainable means to quest efficient energy coversion and storage. Theoretically, water splitting is consisted of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in cathode  $(2H^+ + 2e^- \rightarrow H_2)$

and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in anode  $(2H_2O \rightarrow 4H^+$ +  $O_2$  +  $4e^-$  in acid media or  $4OH^- \rightarrow 2H_2O + O_2 + 4e^-$  in alkaline media).7 According to the Nernst equation, the theoretical decomposition potential of water splitting is 1.23 V vs. RHE. Nonetheless, the electrolysis of water process requires considerable overpotential because of the multiple electron transfer processes and the sluggish kinetic energy barrier generated between anode and cathode.5,8-10 The anodic OER, one of critical steps of splitting water, owing to much larger overpotential and four electron transfer, is especially more difficult than the cathodic HER and severely limited the gross efficiency of water splitting in the electrochemical cell.5,11,12 The precious metal-based catalysts such as iridium and ruthenium oxides (IrO2 and RuO<sub>2</sub>) can significantly reduce the kinetic energy barrier, leading to the lower overpotential and the enhanced energy conversion efficiency. Nevertheless, the low terrestrial abundance and poor durability of iridium and ruthenium oxides impede the commercial application of water splitting. 13-15 Thus, it is indispensable to develop low-cost and efficient OER electrocatalysts to decrease the energy barrier and increase the energy conversion rate.

Iron-group elements (such as iron, cobalt and nickel) have been intensively used to synthesize a variety of catalysts with high electrochemical activity due to the interact effect of transition metals. 6,10,12,14 These reported catalysts composited by iron, cobalt and nickel elements hydroxides, 20-22 involve oxides, 4,16-18 mainly oxyhydroxides, 23,24 phosphide, 25 selenide, 26 boride, 27 and perovskite.<sup>28</sup> Among the bimetalic Fe-based composite catalysts, iron element as a collaborative component can expedite the partial-charge transfer to activate Ni or Co centers and enhance the charge-carrier density and conductivity of catalytic systems. 12 For the past few years, research results have demonstrated polyoxometalates such as phosphomolybdates phosphotungstates with abundant metallo-oxo primarily serve as electrocatalyst, 29-31 photocatalysts, 32,33 dehydration,34 sensor.35 and electrochemical Phosphomolybdate ([PMo<sub>12</sub>O<sub>40</sub>]<sup>3-</sup>, PMo<sub>12</sub>) is a typical twelve

molybdophosphoric heteropoly salt with the Keggin structure, of which the basic structure unit is four groups of three molybdenum-oxide (Mo-O) octahedron, and three molybdenum oxide octahedrons of each group share the oxygen atoms on the vertex angle to combine into Mo3O<sup>10</sup> units with the phosphorus atom at the center of the structure. <sup>36</sup> As has been reported in the literatures, phosphomolybdates are served as the photocatalyst,<sup>37</sup> or used for oxidation catalyst in the form of polyoxometalate metal–organic framework (MOF). 38

Inspired by the above-mentioned electrocatalytic performance about iron-group catalysts and polyoxometalates, we synthesized Fe-Co phosphomolybdate nanoparticles as highly catalytic efficiency for the OER by a facile coprecipitation method at the room temperature. As expected, the Fe-Co-based binary metal catalyst with a high level amorphization and a porous structure promotes electrical conductivity and possesses well catalytic activity due to low overpotential and Tafel slope. Hence, it is a new possibility of exploring non-precious-metal heteropolyacid catalysts about overall water splitting because of the OER catalysts with low cost, high efficiency and environmental benignity.

#### **Experimental section**

*Synthesis of FeCoPM<sup>12</sup> material*

Ammonium phosphomolybdate trihydrate ((NH4)3PO4· 12MoO3·4H2O, POM) solution was prepared as follows: 2 g of ammonium phosphomolybdate trihydrate was dissolved in 15 mL of NaOH solution (2.0 M, pH 15.22) and vigorously stirried for 30 min, and then 15 mL double-distilled water was added into the above solution and stirred for another 30 min to obtain the light yellow solution (pH 12.57). 5.0 mL of aforementioned solution was added into 1.0 mL of mixed solution consisted of 0.50 M Co(NO3)<sup>2</sup> and 0.12 M Fe(NO3)<sup>3</sup> and let stand for 10 h at room tempeature. The as-prepared product (named as FeCoPM12) was centrifuged, washed six times with double-distilled water, dired in a vacuum oven for 24 h at 60 ºC.

*Synthesis of FeCo(OH)<sup>n</sup>*

For the purpose of comparison, FeCo(OH)<sup>n</sup> was prepared by the chemical coprecipitation method. Typically, 5.0 mL of 1.0 M NaOH was added to 1.0 mL of mixed solution consisted of 0.50 M Co(NO3)<sup>2</sup> and 0.12 M Fe(NO3)3, and then the subsequent preparation was similar to the synthesis of FeCoPM<sup>12</sup> sample. The product was named as FeCo(OH)n.

#### *Characterization*

The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained on a Fangyuan DX-2700 powder X-ray diffractometer (China) with Cu K radiation at 40 kV. The morphology and microstructures of FeCoPM<sup>12</sup> were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) using a field emission Hitachi S4800 microscope (Japan). The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images were measured by a FEI Tecnai G2 F20 S (USA) with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The surface state of the catalyst was analysed using a Kratos AXIS ULTRADLD X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS) system (UK). The N2-sorption isotherms of catalysts were measured by the Brunauer-Emmer-Teller (BET) method using Autosorb iQ2 surface area analyser (America) and the BET surface areas and pore size distributions were obtained from the adsorption branch. The fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) spectrum were measured by TENSOR 37 spectrometer (KBr pellets) in the 4000-400 cm -1 range (Germany).The thermal behavior of the products was studied using a METTLER TOLEDO STAR TGA/SDTA 851 thermal analyzer at a heating rate of 10 ºC min -1 in air.

#### *Electrochemical measurement*

The electrochemical characterization of as-prepared samples were performed at room temperature using an Autolab PGSTAT 302 electrochemical workstation (Eco Chemie B.V., Amsterdam, the Netherlands). Platinum foil and Hg/HgO electrode served as counter and reference electrodes respectively. The working electrode used 3.0 mm diameter glassy carbon (GC) disk electrode (area of 0.07 cm<sup>2</sup> ) sealed in glass with copper wire as a connector, which was polished to mirror finish by 0.3 micron alumina suspension on a polishing cloth, and thoroughly cleaned before used for the working electrode. A homogeneous FeCoPM<sup>12</sup> ink was prepared by sonication of 4 mg of the material dispersed in 375 μL double-distilled water, 125 μL isopropanol and 10 μL Nafion (5% wt, Dupont, USA) solution for about 1 h using ultrasonic bath. Finally, 4 μL of sample suspension was dripped onto the GC electrod and naturally

dried at room temperature. The polarization curves were obtained by sweeping the potential from 0.92 V to 1.72 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) with a scan rate of 20 mV s-1 in 1.0 M KOH (pH 13.71). The electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) of the catalysts were surveyed on the GC electrode over a frequency range from 100 kHz to 0.01 Hz at 1.52 V vs. RHE. The double-layer capacitance was performed by sweeping cyclic voltammetry from 1.27 V to 1.37 V vs. RHE. The chronoamperometry curves were recorded on GC electrode at 1.52 V vs. RHE in 1.0 M KOH to investigate the stability of catalyst. And the chronopotentiometry curves at the current density of 100 and 200 mA cm-2 were collected by using two electrode system in 6.0 M KOH electrolyte at 70 ºC to explore the energy consumption and the long-term stability of the electrolysis of water.

### **Result and discussion**

As taken into consideration about the Keggin structure of phosphomolybdate (Figure 1a), the most stable configuration of as-prepared FeCoPM12was investigated at M06/6-31++G(d,p), Lanl2dz level in water with COSMO Model. <sup>39</sup> As shown in Figure 1b and c, the stabilization energies of FePM<sup>12</sup> and CoPM12are respectively 372.8 and 281.9 kJ mol-1 . Four different configurations of iron and cobalt in the molar ratio of 1:4 are calculated. The results show that the gibbs free energy changes of four configurations are 0, 23.6, 45.5 and 73.0 kJ mol-1 , respectively, in which the most stable configuration is the first one (shown in Figure S3). However, iron and cobalt combine with the terminal and bridging oxygens of phosphomolybdate, in which Fe and Co1 are all respectively connected by a terminal oxygen atom and a bridging oxygen atom, while Co2 coordinates with three neighboring bridging oxygen atoms (Figure 1d), and the stabilization energy of FeCoPM<sup>12</sup> is 558.6 kJ mol-1 . This suggests that the as-synthesized FeCoPM12is more stable than FePM<sup>12</sup> and CoPM12. Compared with the structure of FePM<sup>12</sup> and CoPM12, the bond lengths of Fe-O and Co-O change in the stable configuration of FeCoPM12. Therefore, the FeCoPM<sup>12</sup> structure distorts, and many defects and more active sites can be provided.

For confirming chemical composition and structure, the XRD characterization of the as-prepared catalysts was performed. The XRD of the PMo<sup>12</sup> is shown in Figure S1, which indicates good crystalline. The XRD pattern of FeCoPM<sup>12</sup> shown in Figure 2a indicates that the as-fabricated FeCoPM12has three weak and wide diffraction peaks at 11.2º, 34.5º and 59.4º, respectively, which manifests large degrees of amorphization and low levels of crystallinity. Besides, we also fabricated FeCo(OH)<sup>n</sup> sample and investigated its structure by XRD pattern. While the FeCo(OH)<sup>n</sup> consists of multiple high-strength diffraction peaks, suggesting the better crystallization degree of FeCo(OH)<sup>n</sup> catalyst. Contrasted with the XRD pattern of FeCo(OH)<sup>n</sup> fabricated (Figure 2a), it is further verified that the FeCoPM12product possesses higher amorphous degree.

Fig. 1 Stable structures of PM<sup>12</sup> (a), FePM<sup>12</sup> (b), CoPM<sup>12</sup> (c) and FeCoPM<sup>12</sup> (d).

In order to further validate the microstructure and morphology of FeCoPM12, the SEM image was characterized shown in Figure 2b. It can be seen from the SEM image that lots of small FeCoPM12nanoparticles with various sizes agglomerate to form numerous large particles. In addition, the TEM image (Figure 2c) further manifests that the as-prepared FeCoPM12sample is irregularly stacked by lots of small nanoparticles in the 30–40 nm particle-size range. The HRTEM image (Figure 2d) testifies that the FeCoPM12nanoparticles have no distinct lattice fringe, indicating the quite low crystallinity and large degree of amorphization. Moreover, the ambiguous diffraction fringes in selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) (Inset Figure 2d) further confirm that the crystallinity of the FeCoPM<sup>12</sup> nanoparticles is relatively poor, which is consistent with XRD analyses. Such high amorphous structure of FeCoPM<sup>12</sup> material may make for a good contact between the catalyst

and electrolyte and promote electronic transmission of electrode-catalyst-electrolyte. Because the special structure of Fe-Co phosphomolybdate is taken into consideration to affect the electrocatalytic property, the specific surface area and porous feature of the fabricated FeCoPM<sup>12</sup> and FeCo(OH)<sup>n</sup> samples were evaluated by BET measurement of N<sup>2</sup> adsorption-desorption. As seen in Figure S2a, the isotherms of FeCoPM<sup>12</sup> and FeCo(OH)<sup>n</sup> indicate typical type IV isotherms with apparent hysteresis loops, meaning the existence of mesopores in the FeCoPM<sup>12</sup> and FeCo(OH)n. The BET specific surface area of FeCoPM12(72.1 m<sup>2</sup> g -1 ) was higher than that of the hydroxide FeCo(OH)<sup>n</sup> (58.2 m<sup>2</sup>g -1 ). The corresponding pore size distributions of the obtained FeCoPM12and FeCo(OH)<sup>n</sup> samples (Figure S2b) were at 3.8 nm and 4.3 nm, respectively. Though FeCoPM<sup>12</sup> and FeCo(OH)<sup>n</sup> have mesoporous structures, the FeCoPM<sup>12</sup> sample with higher specific surface area can expose more active sites in the electrolyte, which further improves the electrochemical activity.

FT-IR was subsequently conducted to understand the structure information of the as-synthesized FeCoPM<sup>12</sup> (Figure 3). The characteristic band observed at 1042 cm-1 is ascribed to the P-O stretching vibration. The bands at 841 and 771 cm-1 can be attributed to the Mo–O–Mo stretching vibration. <sup>40</sup> This is further verified that the as-prepared nanoparticles are phosphomolybdate material.

The chemical composition and structure of FeCoPM<sup>12</sup> were further investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). As shown in Figure 4a, the Co, Fe, O, Mo, and P elements exhibited in FeCoPM<sup>12</sup> sample. The XPS spectra of Co 2p exhibit two peaks of 797.2 and 781.0 eV as well as broad shoulders at 803.2 and 785.9 eV, respectively, which is characteristic of a Co2+ phase (Figure 4b).<sup>41</sup> Three typial peaks at 725.3, 712.8 eV, and 717.8 eV were obtained in Fe 2p XPS spectra (Figure 4c), indicating the presence of Fe3+ cations.<sup>42</sup> The strong peak at 530.9 eV (Figure 4d) is assigned to O 1s, which is ascribed to the bonding between metal and oxygen.41-43 The two classic peaks of Mo 3d around 235.5 and 232.2 eV are attributable to Mo6+ (shown in Figure 4e), and the peaks of P 2p XPS at around 133.7 and 132.9 eV are attrbutied to the P5+ ions (Figure 4f).44,45

But above all, the FeCoPM<sup>12</sup> material has been successfully synthesized, which possesses abundant structural defects, high amorphous degree and large specific surface area, promoting more active sites on the catalyst surface exposed to the electrolyte and better electronic conductivity. Such features may prompt the FeCoPM<sup>12</sup> catalyst to exhibit excellent electrochemical performance for the OER.

In view of the above structure analysis, the electrocatalytic OER performance of the catalysts was investigated by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) in 1.0 M KOH solution at the same loading of 0.56 mg cm-2 . The catalytic activity of the monometallic and bimetallic catalysts about iron and cobalt was inspected. As shown in Figure 5a, the results testify that FeCoPM12has especially preferable

catalytic performance. The current density of the as-synthesized FeCoPM12is 175.3 mA cm-2 at 1.59 V vs. RHE, and the OER activity of the catalyst is superior to hydroxide catalysts (Figure S5b) and commercial RuO2. This implies that Fe as a synergetic component enhancing the electrical/ionic conductivity and enriching redox reactions is considered as a key activator to promote the electrocatalytic activity of the FeCoPM12material, although FePM<sup>12</sup> is known to be a poor electrocatalyst for the OER.12,46 By comparison with other catalysts reported in the literatures, as listed in the Table S1, the FeCoPM<sup>12</sup> sample only need a nethermore overpential about 258 mV vs the reversible hydrogen electrode to achieve significant O<sup>2</sup> evolution (*j* = 10 mA cm-2 ). Such excellent OER performance illustrates that iron acted as a highly efficient activating agent not only expedites the synergetic effect between iron and cobalt, but also alters the lattice structure of FeCoPM12, and then increases the catalytic activity. Moreover, the presence of molybdenum element may transform the chemical state of

cobalt to higher oxidation states, which can facilitate the formation and reaction of intermediate products in OER reaction.<sup>47</sup> In addition, the different molar ratios of iron and cobalt were explored to influence on the catalytic performance. And the fine catalytic activity for the OER is at a 1:4 molar ratio of iron and cobalt (Figure S3 and S5a). Furthermore, the Tafel slope for FeCoPM<sup>12</sup> (Figure 5b and S6) is about 33 mV dec -1 , lower than FePM12, CoPM<sup>12</sup> and other hydroxide catalysts. This indicates that the reaction kinetics for FeCoPM<sup>12</sup> is favorable and FeCoPM<sup>12</sup> is the more suitable catalyst for electrochemical water-splitting.

As mentioned above, the results of LSV curves and Tafel slope manifest that the FeCoPM<sup>12</sup> sample shows superior electrocatalytic OER performance. To further verify the electrode kinetics of OER, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis was implemented on a standard three-electrode system. As shown in Figure 5c, the EIS curves of several materials were recorded at 1.52 V vs. RHE and the charge transfer resistances (Rct ) were obtained by simulating the EIS datas with a simplified Randles equivalent circuit.

Compared with the other materials, the Rct value of as-prepared FeCoPM<sup>12</sup> is nethermore, which manifests a small charge transfer resistance, superior electron transfer efficiency, good electrical conductivity and high electrocatalytic performance during the electrochemical OER process. Except for high electrocatalytic activity and fast kinetic reaction process of the aforementioned analysis, the stability and durability about the prepared catalyst are pivotal factors to guarantee its long-time energy generation and storage in future. Therefore, loading the decentralized material onto the carbon fiber paper (CFP) and natural drying, the variation of current density with time was examined by means of chronoamperometric measurement at 1.52 V vs. RHE in 1.0 M KOH solution (shown in Figure 5d). The results show that the current density attenuates 8.3 percent after 10 h (17.6 % for FeCo(OH)n). Meanwhile, continuously abundant oxygen gas releasing on the surface of CFP can be observed during the whole measurement. It indicates that the prepared FeCoPM<sup>12</sup> material has good electrocatalytic activity and high stability in the process of water splitting.

As stated above, the as-synthesized FeCoPM<sup>12</sup> has preferable electrochemical activity because its almost amorphous and distorted structure can enlarge the defects and afford more active sites (Figure 1). On this basis, we estimated electrochemical double-layer capacitances (Cdl) of the several materials with cyclic voltammetry (CV) method to compare their electrochemically active surface areas (Aechem) (shown in Figure 6a, b, c and S7a, b, c). The values of Cdl can be received from the slope of the linear plots about current

density versus scan rate. As shown in Figure 6d and S7d, the Cdl value of the synthesized FeCoPM12catalyst is 4971 μF cm-2 , which is larger than other materials. This further testifies that the FeCoPM12sample possesses the large electrochemical active surface area.

In addition, two-electrode system was employed to imitate alkaline water electrolysis at 70 ºC in 6.0 M KOH. Especially, 20 % Pt/C and FeCoPM12electrodes, with a loading of 0.78 mg cm-2 on CFP, were respectively served for cathode and

anode at a continuous current density of 100 and 200 mA cm-2 for 10000s. As shown in Figure 6e, the FeCoPM12electrode exhibits better stablity than RuO2. Moreover, what is worth mentioning, the bias potentials and energy consumption for O<sup>2</sup> of FeCoPM<sup>12</sup> are relatively lower than RuO2(shown in table S2). In the light of the electric energy consumption of commercial alkaline water electrolysis systems, the FeCoPM12material is more suitable for commercial alkaline water electrolysis than RuO2. <sup>48</sup> To evaluate the turnover ability of FeCoPM<sup>12</sup> for the oxygen evolution, the Faradaic efficiency was investigated by chronopotentiometry at a stable current of 10 mA. Compared with the measured value, the coversion efficiency of FeCoPM<sup>12</sup> for producing oxygen was approximately 95% after determining theoretical oxygen yield for 120 min (Figure 6f), which manifested excellent performance for OER.

It is well-known that the morphology and structure of OER materials may change after cycles. Therefore, some information after 100 cycles was investigated. As showed in Figure 2a, after 100 cycles, the high amorphous state of FeCoPM<sup>12</sup> decreased and its diffraction intensity srtengthened compared with the original (un-cycled) sample, whose diffraction peak and intensity in 19º were slightly obvious and increscent. In addition, the two weak diffraction peaks were observed at 36.4º and 64.6º, which were mainly corresponding to the Fe2O3·H2O structure about diffraction peak at (111) (JCPDF card No. 89-2004). Moreover, there are much smaller nanoparticles on the solid surface with particle size range of 10-15 nm (Figure 7a and b), and the apparent lattice fringe and clear diffraction ones can also be respectively observed in Figure 7c and d, inducing to the enhanced crystallinity of FeCoPM12and the less transportation channels.41,49,50 While contrasted with the XPS spectra of FeCoPM12before 100 cycles, the Mo and P contents immensely decreased after 100 cycles of OER (Figure 8e and f), which can be further confirmed by Figure 8a. This may be due to the rupture of P-O and Mo-O bonds, and thus results in the collapse of Keggin structure of phosphomolybdate. Then phosphorus and molybdenum elements respectively in the form of phosphate and molybdate enter into the electrolyte. The peaks at 797.4 and 795.8 eV of Co 2p XPS spectra are assinged to the spin-orbit doublets of Co2+ ions, and the peaks at 781.2 and 780.3 eV are ascribed to the spin-orbit doublets of Co3+ ions. The satellite peaks of Co 2p appear at around 805.7 and 790.0 eV, shown in Figure 8b. 51,52 For the O 1s XPS spectra (Figure 8d), the peaks of around 532.8 and 531.4 eV are attributed to the bound hydroxide groups and the structural water in the catalyst, respectively.<sup>53</sup> The shoulder peaks at 529.6 eV and 530.4eV can be assigned to Co-O interaction owing to a small degree of dehydroxylation during drying process.54,55 As shown in Figure 8c, the XPS spectra of Fe 2p are slightly altered after 100 cycled times. The high-resolution XPS spectrum of P 2p at 133.0 eV is consistent with metal phosphate bonding (Figure 8f).<sup>56</sup> The XPS results indicated that FeCoPM<sup>12</sup> is transformed into homologous oxides and hydroxides after 100 cycles, which is in agreement with the XRD and EDS results (Figure S3).42,55 In addition, according to the IR spectrum (Figure. S8a), the characteristic bands observed at 3444 cm -1 are assigned to the O-H stretching vibration, suggesting that the material possesses hydroxides. The strong peak at 580 cm-1 is ascribed to the stretching vibration of metal-oxygen bond.<sup>43</sup> As seen from Figure. S8b, the thermogravimetric (TG) curve of the final material exhibits a major mass loss in the range of 170-620 ºC in air owing to decomposition of oxides and hydroxides.<sup>43</sup> It can be speculated that maybe contain Co3O4, iron and cobalt hydroxides. Because of low crystallinity, only Fe2O3·H2O can be confirmed by Figure. 2a and 7c. It is precisely because FeCoPM<sup>12</sup> can be regarded as a catalyst precursor that it is oxidized to high-valent oxides at a higher potential, which possesses active sites and prompts the catalytic reaction. 57-59

## **Conclusion**

The large amorphous FeCoPM<sup>12</sup> prepared by a coprecipitation route exhibited high OER activity with current density of 175.3 mA cm-2 at 1.59 V vs. RHE, low overpotential of 258 mV at *j* = 10 mA·cm-2 and small Tafel slope of 33 mV· dec-1 in 1.0 M KOH solution. The material was also of superior durability and preferable electrochemical active

surface area. The FeCoPM12sample owns small bias potentials and low energy consumption for O<sup>2</sup> in two-electrode system of 6 M KOH solution at 70 ºC. As far as we know, all of the above results are superior to RuO<sup>2</sup> so that the as-synthesized sample can be suggested to use for commercial alkaline water electrolysis.

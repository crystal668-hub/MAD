Although many single- and bi-metal sulfides were reported as bifunctional catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), yet the catalytic activity of trimetal sulfides was seldom reported and their catalytic mechanisms need to be further investigated. Herein , trimetal FeCoNi sulphide nanostructures (MSx, M=FeCoNi) are grown on carbon paper as OER catalytic electrodes for alkaline water splitting. The  $MS_x$  outperforms the state-of-the-art  $IrO_2$  in 1 M KOH with a reduced overpotential of 250mV and a superior Tafel Slope of 30 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>. It is found that after OER the morphologies of MS<sub>x</sub> change to nanodots with the smaller size (3-5 nm), therefore, the shorter hydrogen bond on the surfaces of MS<sub>x</sub>-derived nanodots may enable to significantly reduce kinectic energy barries for H2O-splitting.

Keywords: sulphide, phosphide, nano-dot, OER, water splitting.

Hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) is considered as one of the most potential candidates to replace fossil energy because of its high gravimetric energy density and sustainable nature. [1-3] Overall water splitting into hydrogen and oxygen is an important way to obtain hydrogen because it is sustainable, secure, clean and environmentally friendly. Overall alkaline water splitting is a promising approach for commercial hydrogen production due to its advantages of low costs as well as the relatively favorable OER reactivity in strong alkaline solution. [4-6] However, the currently used alkaline electrolyzers still require a potential of 1.8-2.0 V, significantly higher than the theoretical potential (1.23 V) for water splitting. <sup>[7-9]</sup> The large overpotential is attributed to the sluggish OER and fairly facile HER. The OER electrocatalysts requires high activity to minimize the overpotentials to improve the efficiency of water splitting. So far, noble metal Ru/Ir-catalysts are still universally acknowledged as one of the best catalysts for OER but their large-scale application is seriously limited by the high cost, scarcity and poor stability. [10,11]

Recently, transition metal (e.g., Ni, Co, Fe, Mn, and V)based oxides/hydroxides have been reported to show excellent electrocatalytic performance for OER in alkaline solution.[12-15] For example, in our previous work,[16] it was reported that an Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> quantum dots demonstrated excellent

catalytic activity for OER in alkaline solution. More notably, Hu et al.[17] presented that the NiFe and NiCo LDH nanosheets outperformed the state-of-the-art IrO2 catalyst in both activity and stability. In addition, an enhanced OER performance was observed on trimetal NiCoFe oxides<sup>[18,19]</sup> and hydroxides<sup>[20]</sup> due to the modulated electronic structures of catalytic centers and the increased surface area and electronic conductivity with increasing Co and Fe incorporation. However, transition metal oxides/hydroxides presented poor catalytic activity for HER. Transition metal sulphides/phosphides are regarded as the best alternatives to their excellent bifunctional electrocatalytic performance for water splitting. [21-25] Although many singleand bi-metal sulfides were reported as bifunctional catalysts for OER, yet the catalytic activity of trimetal sulfides was seldom reported. Moreover, the catalytic mechanisms of sulfides need to be further investigated in order to select the best OER catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction. And also trimetal phosphides were prepared to be a reference to explore the catalytic effect of trimetal sulfides catalysts.

Herein, we report our recent effort toward this direction in developing trimetal FeCoNi sulphide nanostructures (MS<sub>x</sub>, M=FeCoNi) directly grown on carbon papers (CP) OER complementary catalytic electrodes for overall water splitting

in alkaline solution. Compared to the trimetal FeCoNi hydroxides (M(OH)<sub>x</sub>, M=FeCoNi) grown on carbon paper electrodes, the MS<sub>x</sub> electrodes deliver more efficient and stable electrocatalytic capability for catalyzing OER. Notably, the integrated MS<sub>x</sub> outperforms the state-of-the-art IrO<sub>2</sub> for OER in 1 M KOH with a reduced overpotential of 250mV and a superior Tafel Slope of 30 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>. The enhanced OER activity (as compared to M(OH)<sub>x</sub>) of MS<sub>x</sub> electrodes originates from the faster charge transfer, increased electrochemical surface area (ECSA), and the proper surface of hydride/proton acceptor sites supported by sulphur in the nanostructure to bonding with intermediates in water splitting.

**Fig. 1. a** displays a schematic representation of the (MS<sub>x</sub> @CP, MP<sub>x</sub>@CP, M=FeCoNi) through hydrothermal treatment<sup>[26]</sup> of Fe<sup>3+</sup>, Ni<sup>2+</sup> and Co<sup>2+</sup> with water in the presence of urea at 120 °C for 6 h. The experimental details are in the

support file. Comparing to traditional adhesion process of catalysts with Nafion binder, the direct growth method allows the integration of catalysts onto carbon paper by chemical bonds, which promotes the better electronic transport from active sites to substrate during electrolysis. After hydrothermal treatment, the carbon paper with metallic luster completely became yellow brown without any patches (seen Figure S1, Supporting Information), suggesting the uniform growth of M(OH)<sub>x</sub> on carbon paper. Inductively coupled plasma (ICP) spectrometry shows that the mole ratio of metal Fe: Co: Ni elements in the 3D M(OH)<sub>x</sub>@CP electrode is 1.00: 2.08: 2.03. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of M(OH)<sub>x</sub>@CP electrode in Fig. 1. b shows a 3D structure composed of 1D nanowires and 2D nanosheets. Among them, the length and diameter of 1D nanowires are 500 nm and 50 nm, respectively, the thickness of 2D nanosheets is 20 nm. Especially, inset of Fig. 1. b shows that within 3D structure the well dispersed 1D

nanowires and 2D nanosheets are cross-linked with each

other. This kind of scattered 3D nanostructures can provide a great number of channels to promote the adsorption of electrolyte and very large specific surface area to allow electrocatalytic reactions to occur at the surface of nanostructures. Next, the M(OH)<sub>x</sub> were converted into MS<sub>x</sub> and MP<sub>x</sub> by heating with sulfur powders or Sodium dihydrogen subphosphate (NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>2</sub>). The yellow brown M(OH)<sub>x</sub> electrode completely turned black (seen Figure S1, Supporting Information), suggesting the uniform formation of MS<sub>x</sub> and MP<sub>x</sub> on carbon paper. SEM images in Fig. 1. c, d show that after heating the scattered 3D nanostructures are still intact. The microstructures of MSx and MPx are illustrated in inset of Fig. 1. c, d. It can be seen that the surface morphology of the MPx nanostructures are smooth and the 1D nanowires/2D nanosheets of MS<sub>x</sub> have become rough. The energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) elemental mapping of  $MP_x$  and  $MS_x$  are shown in **Fig. 1. e, f**, it can be clearly observed that the Fe, Co, Ni, P or S are evenly distributed on the surface of the carbon fiber.

Fig. 2. (a)XRD, (b-e) TEM images of MS<sub>x</sub>@CP and MP<sub>x</sub>@CP electrodes.

Fig. 2. a presents X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of three M(OH)<sub>x</sub>@CP, MP<sub>x</sub>@CP and MS<sub>x</sub>@CP electrodes. Two strong characteristic peaks in all diffraction patterns at 25.6°, 43.5° and 54.6° are arising from the carbon paper (PDF#23-0064). The diffraction peaks of M(OH)<sub>x</sub>@CP can be well matched with Ni<sub>0.75</sub>Fe<sub>0.25</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub> (PDF#40-0215), because the partial replacement of Ni and Fe ions by Co ions does not change the crystal structure, which only make a slight change in the lattice parameters.<sup>[27]</sup> The diffraction peaks of  $MS_x@CP$  at 20 values of 32.17°, 36.04°, 39.67°, 46.03°,  $54.23^{\circ}$ , and  $62.26^{\circ}$  can be indexed to the (200), (210), (211), (220), (311), and (321) planes, respectively, of cubic phased (NiFe)S<sub>2</sub> (PDF#02-0852). The XRD patterns of MP<sub>x</sub>@CP only shows the peaks of carbon paper, indicating the formation of amorphous phosphide. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was then used to investigate the nanostructure of the three samples. TEM images of MSx and MP<sub>x</sub> detached ultrasonically from the carbon paper substrate

are presented in Fig. 2. b, d. It is clearly shown that  $MS_x$  is made up of nanocrystals with a diameter of about 10 ~ 15 nm and MPx is made up of cross-linked nanostructures, which is consistent with the SEM images (Fig. 2. c, d). The highresolution TEM (HRTEM) images in Fig. 2. c further exhibited that for MS<sub>x</sub> sample the measured lattice spacing was 0.28 nm corresponding to the diffraction of the (200) lattice plane of (PDF#02-0852), in line with the XRD results. The HRTEM image in Fig. 2. e and corresponding selectedarea electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (inset to Fig. 2. e) confirmed the amorphous nature of MPx nanostructures, coincident with the XRD patterns in Fig. 2. a.

In order to further determine the valence states of the chemical elements in the catalyst, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were carried out. The XPS spectrum of  $M(OH)_x$ ,  $MS_x$  and  $MP_x$  are shown in Figure S2, where the XPS spectra of the Fe, Co, Ni, O, S and P elements are compared and analyzed.

(a) Polarization curves of MP<sub>x</sub>@CP and MS<sub>x</sub>@CP at a scan rate of 1.0 mV s<sup>-1</sup>, along with M(OH)<sub>x</sub>@CP, and IrO<sub>2</sub>/CP for comparison, (b) Polarization curves-derived Tafel slopes for the corresponding electrocatalysts, (c) The capacitive currents at 1.32 V vs. RHE with scan rates from 5 to 50 mV s<sup>-1</sup>, (d) Nyquist plots measured at 1.55 V vs. RHE.

We examined the electrocatalytic OER activities of MS<sub>x</sub> and MP<sub>x</sub> with catalyst areal loading of 1.0 mg cm<sup>-2</sup> in 1 M KOH in a typical three electrode setup with a scan rate of 1 mV s<sup>-1</sup>. Commercial IrO<sub>2</sub> deposited on CP with loading of 1.0 mg cm<sup>-1</sup> was also examined for comparison. Fig. 3. a shows the iR corrected linear-sweep voltammogram (LSV) on the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). It can be observed that MS<sub>x</sub> exhibited an onset potential of 1.45V and overpotential of 250 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. In contrast, MP<sub>x</sub>, IrO<sub>2</sub> and M(OH)<sub>x</sub> showed higher overpotentials of 273 mV, 319 mV, and 328 mV, respectively, at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. Furthermore, the current density obtained for MS<sub>x</sub> at overpotential of 270 mV is 32 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, which is 3 times of that for MP<sub>x</sub> (10.6 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>). These numbers are superior to many other recently reported high-performance OER catalysts (Table S1) and place the MS<sub>x</sub> among the top tier of earth-abundant OER catalysts.

Fig. 3. b illustrates that the Tafel slopes of MP<sub>x</sub> is 94 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>, which is much higher than that of M(OH)<sub>x</sub> (38 mV dec 1) and IrO<sub>2</sub> (73.6 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>), indicating its sluggish kinetics for OER. However, the Tafel slopes of MS<sub>x</sub> is much smaller than other catalysts, suggesting that MS<sub>x</sub> accelerates OER reaction kinetics. In addition, the stability is another important aspect of evaluating the performance of the catalyst. In order to compare the stabilities of different catalysts, MS<sub>x</sub> and MP<sub>x</sub> were cycled 1000 times at a OER region. It can be seen from Fig. 3. a that the LSV curves of MS<sub>x</sub> and MP<sub>x</sub> for OER after 1000 cycles remained unchanged compared to that of the first cycle, which accords with their excellent stability for OER.

Electrochemical-active surface area is also a very important factor to evaluate the catalytic activity of electrocatalysts, which can be obtained by measuring the electrochemical double layer capacitances (Cdl) of the catalysts via cyclic voltammetry (CV). From the CV curves (Figure S3), we measured the values of capacitive currents at 1.32 V vs. RHE. The capacitances values were calculated from these linear plots of capacitive currents with respect to the scan rate. From Fig. 3. c, it is clear that the C<sub>dl</sub> of MS<sub>x</sub> (125 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>) is higher than that of MP<sub>x</sub> (92 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>) and  $M(OH)_x$  (17 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>). It suggests that the  $MS_x$ -derived material has a larger activity area to lead to the increased number of active sites, which is beneficial to enhance the OER activity. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) investigations were conducted to further explore OER kinetics mechanism of catalytic activity. As illustrated in Fig. **3.** d, the EIS experiments for  $MS_x$ ,  $MP_x$  and  $M(OH)_x$  were carried out at the same applied potential (1.55 V vs. RHE). It can be seen that the Nyquist plots of all samples are semicircle. The first intersection of the semicircle with x axis is attributed to the Ohmic resistance (R<sub>s</sub>) arising from the contact between current collector and catalysts. It can be seen that the  $R_s$  values of  $MS_x$  and  $MP_x$  are smaller than that of M(OH)<sub>x</sub>, indicating their better conductivity. The diameter of semicircle denotes the charge transfer resistance (R<sub>ct</sub>) at the interface between the catalysts and the electrolyte. The low value of  $R_{ct}$  (0.58  $\Omega$ ) was realized on  $MS_x$  compared with  $MP_x$  (1.94  $\Omega$ ) and  $M(OH)_x$  (3.11  $\Omega$ ), which also explained its rapid charge transfer kinetics and high catalytic activity.

The structural evolutions of the  $MS_x$  and  $MP_x$  samples after OER for 1000 cycles were investigated by TEM, as shown in **Fig. 4. a-d**. It can be observed that after OER the structures of  $MS_x$  (assembly with ~15nm of particles in **Fig. 2. b**) and  $MP_x$  (cross-linked amorphous nanostructure in **Fig. 2. d**) have changed to nanodots. The average nanodot sizes of  $MS_x$  and  $MP_x$  after OER are 3~5 nm (**Fig. 4. b**) and 5~7(**Fig. 4. d**) nm, respectively. The nanodots can provide very large electrochemical active area (**Fig. 3. c**) and lead to enhance OER performance. As shown in **Figure S4**, XPS were further performed to reveal the composition and element valence in the nanodots.

**Fig. 5**. (a) Schematic diagram of overall water-splitting electrolyzer with MP<sub>x</sub>@CP as anode and MS<sub>x</sub>@CP as cathode (MP<sub>x</sub>@CP-MS<sub>x</sub>@CP), (b) Two electrode OER polarization curves of MP<sub>x</sub>@CP-MS<sub>x</sub>@CP, Pt-MS<sub>x</sub>@CP and Pt-IrO<sub>2</sub>/CP electrolyzers, (c) long-term durability at a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>.

In order to measure the catalytic efficiency of the catalyst, drainage method was carried out at 14.2 °C with a current density of 20 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. The volume of O<sub>2</sub> produced over time can be seen in **Fig. 5.** and according to the Equation law of Ideal Gas State:

$$pv = nRT$$

the catalytic efficiency of  $MS_x@CP$  is calculated to be 96.9%.

All of the experiments described above suggest that the  $MS_x$  has an excellent electrocatalytic performance for OER. On account of that metal phosphides are reported as efficient catalysts for HER, we constructed a two-electrode electrolyzer system using the  $MP_x$  as anode and  $MS_x$  as cathode  $(MP_x-MS_x)$  to go one step closer to a real overall water-splitting system in 1 m KOH. As shown in **Figure S5**.

 $MP_x$ - $MS_x$  has an onset potential of 1.62 V and remained unchanged after 30 h of continuous electrolysis testing (**Table S2**), which out performs Pt-IrO<sub>2</sub> and Pt- $MS_x$  as well as the most of the currently reported overall water splitting systems.

In summary, we have successfully prepared trimetal FeCoNi sulphide nanostructures directly grown on carbon paper as OER catalytic electrodes for overall water splitting in alkaline solution. We have found that the MS<sub>x</sub>@CP electrodes deliver more efficient and stable electrocatalytic capability for catalyzing OER. Notably, the integrated MS<sub>x</sub> outperforms the state-of-the-art IrO2 for OER. We have further observed that after OER the morphologies of MS<sub>x</sub> change to nanodots, the smaller size (3-5nm) and shorter hydrogen bonds on the surfaces of MS<sub>x</sub>-derived nanodots facilitate the MS<sub>x</sub> to obtain better OER performance. It is also demonstrated that in a two-electrode alkaline water electrolyzer with MS<sub>x</sub> anode and MP<sub>x</sub> cathode, the cell voltage was significantly reduced (to ≈1.62 V) to achieve a stable current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, indicating superior activity to those of well-developed overall-water splitting electrocatalysts reported so far.

### **Experimental**

Experiment Materials: Nickel nitrate hexahydrate [Ni(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>.6H<sub>2</sub>O], Cobalt nitrate hexahydrate

[Co(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>6H<sub>2</sub>O], Iron (Ⅲ) nitrate nonahydrate [Fe(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>9H<sub>2</sub>O] and hydrochloric acid were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent. Urea was purchased from Aladdin-e. Sulfur powder was purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent and Sodium hypophosphite [NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>2</sub>] was purchased from Macklin. All chemicals were used as received without further treatment. Carbon paper (CP) was purchased from Hesen Shanghai (HCPO<sub>3</sub>0). The carbon paper was cleaned with deionized (DI) water, ethanol and 1M HCl.

Synthesis of M(OH)<sub>x</sub>: A solution of 0.5 mmol cobalt nitrate, 0.5 mmol nickel nitrate and 0.5 mmol iron (III) nitrate was prepared in 40 mL water and well stirred. Then 5 mmol urea were added to the solution and the solution was stirred for 10 min to make sure it was clean and lucency. After that the solution was transferred to a 50mL Teflon-lined stainless steel reactor with the carbon paper in it. The reactor was shaken to exhaust the air in the crevice of the carbon paper. Then the reactor was tightly sealed and held at 120 °C for 18 hours in an electric heat oven. After falling to room temperature, the carbon paper was taken out and washed with DI water and ethanol. Then the carbon paper was dried off in a vacuum oven for overnight and M(OH)<sub>x</sub> was successfully prepared.

Synthesis of MS<sub>x</sub> and MP<sub>x</sub>: MS<sub>x</sub> and MPx were prepared in the similar method. As for the synthesis of MS<sub>x</sub>, sulfur powder was used as the source of sulfur in the sulfur reaction. The M(OH)<sub>x</sub> and sulfur powder were placed in two corundum crucible and put into the tube furnace at the downstream part and upstream part respectively. After that, they were heated in the argon atmosphere at 500°C for an hour. After natural cooling down, MSx was taken out. NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>2</sub> was used as the source of phosphorus in the reaction to synthesis MPx. The M(OH)<sub>x</sub> was placed in a corundum crucible into the downstream part of the tube furnace and the NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>2</sub> was put into another corundum crucible into the upstream part of the tube furnace. Then heated them to 300 °C under argon atmosphere for an hour. After cooling down the MPx was successfully prepared.

Characterization: To identified the phase formation of the catalysts, the X-ray powder diffraction patterns was surveyed by Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer with Cu K $\alpha$  ( $\lambda$ =0.15418 nm). Diffraction data of the samples were measured in 20 range of 10° - 80° in steps of 0.02 degrees per second. The SEM images and EDS element analysis of the samples were investigated by filed-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, ZEISS Supra 55) at an accelerating voltage of 5.00 kV. To obtain more detailed information, the TEM images and HRTEM images were obtained by high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM, Tecnai G2 F20 S-TWIN, 200KV). The XPS data was obtained by using ESCALAB 250XL to observed oxidation states and chemical bonding energy between the elements in the catalyst samples.

**Electrochemical Measurements:** The electrochemical impedance spectra and the electrochemical performance of the samples were tested by using CHI 660E (ChenHua Instruments Co., China). All the electrochemical experiments were tested in 1 M KOH solution at a scan rate of 1 mV s<sup>-1</sup>. A saturated Ag/AgCl electrode was used as the reference electrode in the electrochemical experiment. OER tests were carried out by using a platinum electrode as the counter electrode. All of the potentials in the LSV curves were 70 % iR corrected. The carbon

paper is made up of lots of carbon fibers, thus the current density tested was based on the geometrical area. The overall water splitting test was carried out in a two-electrode system, with  $MS_x$  as the anode and the  $MP_x$  as the cathode. All the potentials of the catalysts reported in this work were against the RHE, where  $E_{RHE} = E_{Ag/AgCl} + 1.023 \text{ V}$ .

The preparation details of  $IrO_2$  electrode is as follows. 10 mg catalysts and 100  $\mu$ L of Nafion solution (5 wt%, Sigma-Aldrich) were dispered in 1 mL water mixed with 0.9 mL isopropyl alcohol. The mixture was ultrasonicated for 30 min to ensure that the catalysts powder was evenly dispersed. Then 8 mL of the dispersion was transferred onto the glassy carbon disk electrode, and the catalyst mass loading is 0.2mg cm<sup>-2</sup>. Before electrochemical measurements, the mixture on the glassy carbon was dried naturally at room temperature.

As shown in **Figure S2b** and **2c**, cobalt and nickel elements have a lower valence changed from  $Co^{2+/3+}$  and  $Ni^{2+}$  to nearly  $Co^{\delta+}$  ( $\delta$  is likely close to 0) and  $Ni^{\delta+}$  after vulcanization and phosphating (**Figure S2a**). As for iron,  $Fe^{3+}$  changed close to  $Fe^{\delta+}$  after vulcanization and almost to  $Fe^{2+}$  after phosphating (**Figure S2a**). XPS spectra of O element in  $M(OH)_x$  is shown in **Figure S2d** the peak at 531.2eV is the characteristic peak of the M-O-H bond (M = Fe, Co, Ni). After vulcanization treatment, the characteristic peak of S2p is attributed to the  $S2p_{3/2}$  which has a binding energy of 162.8 eV, the peak located at higher binding energy of 168.6 eV is attributed to the  $S2p_{1/2}$  (**Figure S2f**). As shown in **Figure S2e**, the peaks at the binding energy of 129.8 eV and 130.8 eV are attributed to the  $P2p_{3/2}$  and  $P2p_{1/2}$ , respectively of M-P, the peak at 134.5 eV is the characteristic peak of the oxidized phosphorus, which is due to the exposure of  $P_x$  in the air  $P_x$  in the air  $P_x$  in the air  $P_x$  in the air  $P_x$  in the air  $P_x$  in the air  $P_x$  in the air  $P_x$  in the air  $P_x$  in the air  $P_x$  in the air  $P_x$  in the air  $P_x$  in the air  $P_x$  in the air  $P_x$  in the air  $P_x$  in the air  $P_x$  in the air  $P_x$  in the air  $P_x$  in the air  $P_x$  in the air  $P_x$  in the air  $P_x$  in the air  $P_x$  in the air  $P_x$  in the air  $P_x$  in the air  $P_x$  in the air  $P_x$  in the air  $P_x$  in the air  $P_x$  in the air  $P_x$  in the air  $P_x$  in the air  $P_x$  in the air  $P_x$  in the air  $P_x$  in the air  $P_x$  in the air  $P_x$  in the air  $P_x$  in the air  $P_x$  in the air  $P_x$  in the air  $P_x$  in the air  $P_x$  in the air  $P_x$  in the air  $P_x$  in the air  $P_x$  in the air  $P_x$  in the air  $P_x$  in the air  $P_x$  in the air  $P_x$  in the air  $P_x$  in the air  $P_x$  in the air  $P_x$  in the air  $P_x$  in the air  $P_x$  in the air  $P_x$  in the air  $P_x$  in the air  $P_x$  in the air  $P_x$  in the air  $P_x$  in the air  $P_x$  in the air  $P_x$  in the air  $P_x$  in the air  $P_x$  in the

**Figure S4a** and **b** present that P and S elements in MP<sub>x</sub>- and MS<sub>x</sub>-derivative nanodots after OER disappear, and **Figure S4c** shows that the cooperated anions in nanodots are mainly hydroxide and lattice  $O^{2-[r32]}$ . Similar results have been reported by Chen et al. [r33] It is well known that during OER transition metal FeCoNi are hydride acceptor sites in nanodots, which bonds with intermediates and oxidized to higher valence, forming MOOH (M = Fe, Co and Ni) active sites [r29]. **Figure S4d-f** present that the binding energies of Fe2p, Co2p and Ni2p are all close to the values of reported FeOOH (712.5 eV) [r34], CoOOH (780.1 eV) [r35] and NiOOH (855.05 eV). [r36] Intriguingly, however, MOOH (M = Fe, Co and Ni) in MS<sub>x</sub>-derivative nanodots shifts to lower binding energy compared with that in MP<sub>x</sub>-derivative nanodots. The shorter hydrogen bond formed on the surface can be proposed from the large negative shift of O-H binding energy in MS<sub>x</sub>-derivative nanodots in **Figure S4c**, which enable to significantly reduce kinectic energy barries for H<sub>2</sub>O-splitting [r37]. Therefore, the smaller size and shorter hydrogen bond in MS<sub>x</sub>-derivative nanodots facilitate the MS<sub>x</sub> electrode to achieve better OER performance.

As shown in **Figure S5a**, for comparation, we also fabricated electrolyzers having the structures Pt-MS<sub>x</sub> and Pt-IrO<sub>2</sub>. **Figure S5b** displays the OER polarization LSV curves of all three electrolyzers. The results show that the onset potential of MP<sub>x</sub> -MS<sub>x</sub> is about 1.53V, and its potential is 1.62V at a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, lower than that of Pt-IrO<sub>2</sub> (1.64V), Pt-MS<sub>x</sub> (1.68V). We also tested the long-term durability of the three electrolyzers for 30 h in 1 M KOH electrolyte. As shown in **Figure S5c**. For Pt-IrO<sub>2</sub>, the onset potentials at the current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> is 1.64 V. However, after 30 h of galvanostatic testing the potential degenerated to 1.87 V. By contrast, MP<sub>x</sub>-MS<sub>x</sub> has an onset potential of 1.62 V and remained unchanged after 30 h of continuous electrolysis testing.

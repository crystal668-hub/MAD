# **1. Introduction**

Electrochemical water splitting (EWS) is a clean and renewable technology for hydrogen generation,[1] but its wide-spread uses have been largely blocked by the sluggishness of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) due to the involvement of multiple proton–electron coupled reaction steps.[1b,2] The development of efficient catalysts to drive the OER is therefore of great importance. Generally, the EWS can be proceeded either in the acid, neutral, or alkaline media. Compared with that in the neutral or alkaline media, the acid EWS using proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzers has advantages of lower ohmic losses, higher current density and voltage efficiency, and a faster system response.[3] Nevertheless, the practical utilization of the acid or PEM electrolyzers have been greatly limited by the narrow selectability of the acidstable catalysts.[4] The vast majority of the

catalysts reported for the OER in the neutral or alkaline media are not stable in the acid media and ready to undergo corrosion/decomposition under the highly oxidative acidic OER environments.[5] Currently, the benchmark catalysts for the acidic OER are RuO2- and IrO2-based materials. Among them, the RuO2-based catalysts are of particular interests due to their relatively higher activities, earth abundance, and lower costs with respect to the IrO2-based ones.[6] However, to fulfill the requirements for reliable commercial applications, the catalytic activities of the RuO2-based catalysts, especially the long-term stabilities, have to be substantially improved.

Approaches employed for the enhancements of the catalytic activities of the RuO2-based catalysts mainly include metal doping,[7] heterostructuring,[8] defect engineering,[9] and morphological control.[10] The core of these approaches is to regulate the arrangement surface atoms and modulate the electronic structure of RuO2, optimizing the binding strength and transformation of intermediates (i.e., \*OH, \*O, and \*OOH) during the OER.[11] For example, the metal doping can tune the electronic structure of RuO2 through charge redistribution, lowering the energy barrier of the rate-determining step of the OER.[12] The formation of the vacancy defects, such as oxygen vacancies (Vo·),[13] can alter the position of the d-band center of Ru with respect to the Fermi level, moderating the intermediate

adsorption and thereby improving the intrinsic catalytic activity of RuO2. Generally, to achieve the high catalytic activities for the OER, manipulation of Ru in RuO2 to the relatively higher oxidation state is more favored.[12]

The poor stability is a major issue hampering the practical applications of RuO2 in the acid OER. Tremendous efforts have, therefore, been devoted to improve the stabilities of RuO2. This, however, remains a great challenge. Less work has reported that the RuO2-based catalysts can maintain the stable high catalytic activities for the acid OER for *>*500 h. Generally, the poor stability of RuO2 mainly stems from two reasons, that is, oxidative release of lattice oxygen and leaching of surface Ru.[14] The former is caused by the over-oxidation of Ru into dissolvable RuO4 and the participation of the lattice oxygen in the OER, while the latter is caused by the demetallization of the surface Ru.[13a,15] So, to realize a high stabilization of RuO2 in the acidic OER, the simultaneous improvements in the stabilities of the lattice oxygen and surface Ru are highly desirable. In this case, both the oxidative release of lattice oxygen and the leaching of surface Ru can be avoided.

In this work, we report a novel approach, which involves the carbon nanotube (CNT) supporting, the carbon coating, and defect engineering, to improve the catalytic activity and stability of RuO2 for the acidic OER. Specifically, the ultrathin nitrogendoped carbon (NC) coated oxygen-vacancy rich RuO2 nanoparticles (NPs) supported on the CNTs (NC@Vo·-RuO2/CNTs-350) are synthesized through a controlled calcination in air. When used in the acidic OER, the NC@Vo·-RuO2/CNTs-350 only needs an overpotential of 170.0 mV to drive 10.0 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2. Its mass activity is *>*110 times higher than the commercial RuO2 (c-RuO2). In particular, the NC@Vo·-RuO2/CNTs-350 shows the excellent stability in the acidic OER with no distinguishable activity loss observed when used for *>*900 h. More interestingly, an electrolyzer assembled with the NC@Vo·-RuO2/CNTs-350 only needs a record-low cell voltage of 1.45 V to deliver 10.0 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> and shows significantly low performance drop (*<*35.0 mV) for *>*1000 h. The DFT calculations have shown that the high catalytic activity of the NC@Vo·-RuO2/CNTs-350 mainly arises from the strong electronic coupling between RuO2 and NC/CNTs, which increases the oxidation state of Ru at the active site and improves the stabilities of the lattice oxygen and surface Ru. The presence of oxygen vacancies can strengthen the electronic coupling. The OER by the NC@Vo·-RuO2/CNTs-350 favors the adsorbate evolving mechanism (AEM). These results well explain why the NC@Vo·-RuO2/CNTs-350 can exhibit the high catalytic activity and excellent stability for the OER.

### **2. Result and Discussion**

A schematic illustration for the synthesis of the NC@Vo·- RuO2/CNTs-350 is given in **Scheme 1**. Briefly, the CNTs supported RuO2 NPs (RuO2/CNTs) were first synthesized through the hydrothermal reaction of Ru<sup>3</sup><sup>+</sup> in the presence of the acid-treated CNTs. The obtained RuO2/CNTs were then coated with polyaniline (PANI) to form the PANI@RuO2/CNTs. The NC@Vo·-RuO2/CNTs-350 was finally obtained by the calcination of the PANI@RuO2/CNTs at 350 °C in air. **Figure 1**a shows a typical TEM image of the NC@Vo·-RuO2/CNTs-350, where a structure consisting of the RuO2 NPs grown on the CNTs can be clearly visualized. HRTEM reveals the good crystallinity of the RuO2 NPs, in which the lattice fringes, corresponding to the (110), (101), and (211) planes of rutile-structure RuO2, can be observed. This is well consistent with the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of the NC@Vo·-RuO2/CNTs-350 (Figure 1c), which shows the obvious diffraction rings indexable to the (110), (101), and (211) planes of the rutile-structure RuO2. Closer inspection indicates that each RuO2 NP is coated with an ultrathin layer of carbon shell (≈0.60 nm) in Figure 1b. The average size of the RuO2 NPs is 2.32 ± 0.19 nm (Figure S1, Supporting Information), which is larger than that of the RuO2 NPs in the PANI@RuO2/CNTs (1.29 ± 0.14 nm, Figure S2, Supporting Information). It suggests that the calcination at 350 °C would lead to a slight growth of the RuO2 NPs. The RuO2 NPs in the NC@Vo·- RuO2/CNTs-350 are defect-rich, as demonstrated by the discontinuity of the lattice fringes shown by the inverse fast-Fourier transfer (in-FFT) image in Figure 1b. These observations well verify the formation of the NC@Vo·-RuO2/CNTs-350, which possesses a structure consisting of ultra-thin carbon coated Vo·-rich RuO2 NPs on the CNTs. **Figure 2**a shows an XRD pattern of the NC@Vo·-RuO2/CNTs-350, in which the diffraction peaks corresponding to the (002) plane of the graphitic carbon and the (110), (101), and (211) planes of rutile-structure RuO2 (PDF# 71–2273) are clearly observable. It further confirms the presence of RuO2 and graphitic carbon in the NC@Vo·-RuO2/CNTs-350. Figure 1d displays the EDS elemental mapping images of the NC@Vo·- RuO2/CNTs-350. It shows the uniform distribution of Ru, O, C, and N along the profile of the NC@Vo·-RuO2/CNTs-350.

The XPS spectroscopic measurements have been conducted to gain more structural information on the NC@Vo·-RuO2/CNTs-350. The survey spectrum in Figure S3a, Supporting Information, indicates that the NC@Vo·-RuO2/CNTs-350 is composed of Ru, O, C, and N. The presence of Ru and C can be further demonstrated by the high-resolution C 1s/Ru 3d

spectrum in Figure S3b, Supporting Information. Spectra deconvolution shows the peaks at 284.8, 285.8, and 288.2 eV, ascribable to the C=C, C–O/C–N and C–C=O bonds in carbon of the NC@Vo·-RuO2/CNTs-350, respectively, and the peaks at 281.2 and 285.4 eV, ascribable to Ru 3d5/2 and Ru 3d3/2 of RuO2, respectively. The peaks at 282.8 and 286.2 eV can be attributed to the shakeup satellites of Ru 3d5/2 and Ru 3d3/2, respectively. Figure 2b gives the Ru 3p3/2 spectrum of the NC@Vo·-RuO2/CNTs-350. It shows the peaks at 462.8 and 465.7 eV, ascribable to Ru<sup>4</sup><sup>+</sup> and Ru<sup>3</sup><sup>+</sup> of Ru 3p3/2, respectively. The emergence of Ru3<sup>+</sup> well validates the presence of Vo· in RuO2. This can be further confirmed by the O 1s spectrum in Figure 2c. It shows the peaks corresponding to oxygen in the lattice of RuO2 (OL, 529.7 eV), the vicinity of Vo· (531.2 eV), and the bonds of Ru–OH (≈530.5 eV), C=O/C–O (532.0 eV) and surface adsorbed oxygenous species (Osurf, 533.0 eV, such as H2O), respectively. In particular, the electron spin resonance (ESR) spectrum of the NC@Vo·- RuO2/CNTs-350 shows a pronounced signal at *g* = 2.003 (Figure 2d), ascribable to the electrons trapped in Vo·. [16] This gives a stronger support on the presence of Vo· in RuO2. Figure S3c, Supporting Information, gives the N 1s spectrum of the NC@Vo·- RuO2/CNTs-350. Spectra deconvolution shows the peaks corresponding to pyridinic-, pyrrolic-, graphitic-, and oxidized-type nitrogen, respectively. These nitrogenous species are derived from the PANI. Their appearance strongly suggests the presence of the NC in the NC@Vo·-RuO2/CNTs-350. The TGA analysis in Figure 2f indicates that the relatively weight percentage of RuO2 in the NC@Vo·-RuO2/CNTs-350 is 43.1 wt%. It is well consistent with the result obtained from the ICP-OES analysis, which shows a Ru atomic percentage of 33.2%. It indicates that the relatively weight percentage of RuO2 in the NC@Vo·-RuO2/CNTs-350 is 42.5 wt%.

To well understand the formation mechanism of the ultrathin NC shell and Vo· in RuO2 for the NC@Vo·-RuO2/CNTs-350, the calcination of the PANI@RuO2/CNTs at the different temperatures in air is performed. Figure S4, Supporting Information, shows that the pristine RuO2/CNTs exhibits a structure consisting of the small-sized RuO2 NPs (1.29 ± 0.08 nm) grown on the CNTs. These RuO2 NPs are less defective. As shown in Figure 2d, the RuO2/CNTs shows a lower ESR signal corresponding to Vo·. The PANI coating does not change the structure of the RuO2/CNTs, but gives it with a thick coating layer with an extremely rough surface (Figure S2a, Supporting Information). Figure 2d shows that the PANI@RuO2/CNTs exhibits a slight increase in the ESR signal corresponding to Vo· with respect to the RuO2/CNTs. It indicates that the PANI coating increases the Vo· in RuO2, which might be achieved by the removal of oxygen atoms at the surface of RuO2 through the PANI coating. The FTIR spectra in Figure S5a, Supporting Information, show that the PANI@RuO2/CNTs exhibits apparent peaks at 1564 and 1483 cm<sup>−</sup>1, ascribable to the characteristic N=Q=N and N=B=N stretching modes of the quinonoid and benzenoid units of the PANI,[17] respectively. It well demonstrates the presence of the PANI shell in the PANI@RuO2/CNTs. Due to the relatively higher thickness of the PANI layer (≈26.5 nm, Figure S2a, Supporting Information), the XRD pattern of the PANI@RuO2/CNTs only exhibits the diffraction peak corresponding to the CNTs with no obvious peaks corresponding to RuO2 observed (Figure S5b, Supporting Information).

The calcination of the PANI@RuO2/CNTs at the relatively low temperature of 300 °C in air will lead to the decomposition and carbonization of the PANI with simultaneous formation of more Vo· in RuO2. TEM (Figure 1a and Figure S6a, Supporting Information) indicates that the NC@Vo·-RuO2/CNTs-300 exhibits a structure resembling to that of the NC@Vo·-RuO2/CNTs-350, in which the growth of the RuO2 NPs on the CNTs can be clearly observed. These RuO2 NPs are encapsulated in the thin layer of the NC shell (≈2.62 nm, Figure S6b, Supporting Information), similar to the case of the NC@Vo·-RuO2/CNTs-350, although the thickness of the NC shell is slightly higher than that in the NC@Vo·-RuO2/CNTs-350 (Figure 1b). The average size of the RuO2 NPs is 1.56 ± 0.13 nm (Figure S6, Supporting Information), which is close to that of the RuO2 NPs in the PANI@RuO2/CNTs (Figure S2, Supporting Information). It suggests that the presence of the thicker NC shell can well protect the growth of the RuO2 NPs during the calcination. In particular, due to the presence of the thicker NC shell and the small size of the RuO2 NPs, the XRD pattern (Figure S5b, Supporting Information) of the NC@Vo·-RuO2/CNTs-300 does not show obvious diffraction peaks corresponding to RuO2. The carbonization and decomposition of PANI during the calcination can be demonstrated by the greatly reduced thickness of the NC shell in the NC@Vo·-RuO2/CNTs-300 with respect to the PANI shell in the PANI@RuO2/CNTs and the relatively smoother surface of the NC@Vo·-RuO2/CNTs-300. It is further evidenced by the FTIR spectra in Figure S5a, Supporting Information, which show that the NC@Vo·-RuO2/CNTs-300 exhibits a great reduction in the intensities of the peaks corresponding to the N=Q=N and N=B=N stretching modes of the quinonoid and benzenoid units. The formation of more Vo· in RuO2 can be verified by its ESR spectrum in Figure 2d, which shows an increase of the signal corresponding to Vo· with respect to the PANI@RuO2/CNTs. In particular, the formation of more Vo· is attributable to the reaction of RuO2 with carbon in the CNTs/PANI through: RuO2 + C → Vo · -RuO2 + CO2. This is in good agreement with the observation that the NC@Vo·-RuO2/CNTs-300 exhibits a lower intensity of the ESR signal corresponding to Vo· than the NC@Vo·- RuO2/CNTs-350 (Figure 2d). The lower calcination temperature lowers the violence of the reaction between RuO2 and the CNTs/PANI, producing fewer Vo· in the NC@Vo·-RuO2/CNTs-300 than in the NC@Vo·-RuO2/CNTs-350. Worthnoting is that the PANI@RuO2/CNTs and the NC@Vo·-RuO2/CNTs-300 are not dispersible in water, as shown in Figure S7, Supporting Information. This is different from the NC@Vo·-RuO2/CNTs-350, which is readily dispersible in water. This observation may suggest that the PANI shell and the thicker carbon shell derived from the PANI have a relatively hydrophobic property, making the PANI@RuO2/CNTs and the NC@Vo·-RuO2/CNTs-300 not dispersible in water. The increase of the calcination temperature to 350 °C greatly reduces the NC shell thickness. It renders the RuO2 NPs partially exposed to air, which increases the hydrophilicity and dispersibility of the NC@Vo·-RuO2/CNTs-350 in water due to the hydrophilic nature of RuO2. In particular, due to the partial exposure of RuO2, which reduces its protection from the NC shell during the calcination, the RuO2 NPs in the NC@Vo·-RuO2/CNTs-350 exhibit a relatively larger size (2.32 ± 0.19 nm) than those in the NC@Vo·-RuO2/CNTs-300 (1.56 ± 0.13 nm).

The increase of the calcination temperature up to 400 °C will lead to the excess decomposition of the PANI. TEM reveals the absence of the NC shell in the Vo·-RuO2/CNTs-400 obtained from the calcination of the PANI@RuO2/CNTs at 400 °C (Figure S8a, Supporting Information). It suggests the complete decomposition of the PANI. Due to the entire loss of the NC shell protection, the obvious growth of the RuO2 NPs occurs during the calcination. The RuO2 NPs in the Vo·-RuO2/CNTs-400 show an apparent aggregation and exhibit a much larger size (4.76 ± 0.50 nm, Figure S8, Supporting Information) than those in the NC@Vo·- RuO2/CNTs-300 and the NC@Vo·-RuO2/CNTs-350. Additionally, the decomposition of the CNTs can also be observed in the Vo·- RuO2/CNTs-400. As shown in Figure S5c, Supporting Information, the Vo·-RuO2/CNTs-400 exhibits much lower intensities of the Raman peaks corresponding to the D and G bands of the CNTs. No distinct peaks corresponding to the (002) diffraction of the graphitic carbon can be observed in the XRD pattern (Figure S5b, Supporting Information) of the Vo·-RuO2/CNTs-400. In particular, due to the absence of the NC shell protection, the reaction of the Vo·-RuO2 with O2 during the calcination in air occurs. The Vo·-RuO2/CNTs-400 shows a lower intensity of the ESR signal (Figure 2d) corresponding to Vo· than the NC@Vo·-RuO2/CNTs-350. Further increase of the calcination temperature will lead to the full decomposition of the CNTs. Figure S5c, Supporting Information, shows that the Vo·-RuO2-500, obtained from the calcination of the PANI@RuO2/CNTs at 500 °C, exhibits a complete disappearance of the Raman peaks corresponding to the D and G bands of the CNTs. No diffraction peak corresponding to the (002) planes of the graphitic carbon can be observed in the XRD pattern (Figure S5b, Supporting Information) of the Vo·-RuO2-500. Due to the absence of the CNTs and the NC shell, the Vo·-RuO2-500 shows a more significant aggregation and growth of the RuO2 NPs (8.28 ± 0.78 nm, Figure S9, Supporting Information). The ESR signal corresponding to Vo· is further reduced because of the reaction of the Vo·-RuO2 with O2 (Figure 2d).

The results shown above clearly indicate that the formation of the NC@Vo·-RuO2/CNTs-350 mainly depends on the controlled calcination of the PANI@RuO2/CNTs in air at 350 °C. Specifically, when the PANI@RuO2/CNTs are calcined at the relatively low temperature, the CNTs supported RuO2 with thicker NC layer and fewer Vo· will be produced. While at the high calcination temperature, the excess decomposition of PANI and CNTs will lead to the formation of the RuO2 aggregates with fewer Vo·. This temperature-dependent calcination products can be explained by the TGA curve of the PANI@RuO2/CNTs. As shown in Figure 2e, the TGA curve of the PANI@RuO2/CNTs exhibits a three-step weight loss with increase of temperature in air. Specifically, the weight loss at *<*110 °C can be attributed to the loss of physically adsorbed H2O (step I); the weight loss at 115–425 °C can be attributed to the decomposition and carbonization of the PANI, along with the decomposition of the CNTs starting at ≈400 °C (step II); and the weight loss at 425–650 °C can be attributed to the decomposition (step III). This result makes it clear that when the PANI@RuO2/CNTs are calcined at 300 °C, the relatively low decomposition rate of the PANI will lead to the formation of the NC shell with a higher thickness. Additionally, the slow reaction rate of RuO2 with carbon in PANI and CNTs at this low temperature produces fewer Vo· in RuO2. When the calcination temperature is increased to 350 °C, the increased decomposition rate of the PANI results in the formation of the NC shell with a thinner thickness and the partial exposure of RuO2 to air. This improves the hydrophilicity of the NC@Vo·-RuO2/CNTs-350, making it readily dispersible in water (Figure S7, Supporting Information). Additionally, the increased reaction violence between RuO2 and carbon in the PANI/CNTs at 350 °C facilitates the formation of more Vo· in RuO2. At the calcination temperature of 400 °C, the decomposition of the CNTs starts to occur. The complete decomposition of the PANI exposes the RuO2 NPs directly to air, decreasing the density of Vo· in RuO2 through the reaction with O2. In particular, due to the absence of the NC shell and partial decomposition of the CNTs, the RuO2 NPs in the Vo·-RuO2/CNTs-400 show the obvious growth and aggregation. At the temperature of 500 °C, the complete decomposition of the CNTs leads to the significant aggregation and growth of the RuO2 NPs. The increased reaction with O2 further reduces the density of Vo· in RuO2 of the Vo·-RuO2-500.

Control experiments show that when the PANI@RuO2/CNTs are calcined at 350 °C under the N2 environment, the CNTs supported Vo·-RuO2 NPs with a thicker NC shell (the NC@Vo·- RuO2/CNTs-350(N2)) are obtained (Figure S10a, Supporting Information). Figure 2d shows that the NC@Vo·-RuO2/CNTs-350(N2) exhibits an ESR signal corresponding to Vo· with the intensity comparable to the NC@Vo·-RuO2/CNT-350. The size of the RuO2 NPs (1.46 ± 0.02 nm, Figure S10, Supporting Information) in the NC@Vo·-RuO2/CNT-350(N2) is well close to that in the PANI@RuO2/CNTs (1.29 ± 0.14 nm, Figure S2, Supporting Information). This observation well demonstrates that the formation of more Vo· is achieved by the reaction of RuO2 with carbon in the PANI/CNTs and the presence of the NC shell can protect the RuO2 NPs from the growth during the calcination. In particular, due to the calcination in N2, which avoids the decomposition of the PANI by O2, the NC@Vo·-RuO2/CNTs-350(N2) shows a much higher NC shell thickness (≈22.7 nm, Figure S10a, Supporting Information) than the NC@Vo·-RuO2/CNTs-350 (≈0.60 nm, Figure 1b). The NC@Vo·-RuO2/CNTs-350(N2) is also not dispersible in water (Figure S7, Supporting Information), further demonstrating the hydrophobic nature of the NC shell derived from the PANI.

Additionally, when the RuO2/CNTs are directly calcined at 350 °C in air, the CNTs supported Vo·-RuO2 NPs (Vo·- RuO2/CNTs-350) with much larger sizes of the RuO2 NPs (26.0 ± 0.37 nm, Figure S11, Supporting Information) will be obtained. It further demonstrates that the presence of the NC shell can protect the RuO2 NPs from the growth during the calcination. This finding gives a strong support that the formation of the RuO2 NPs in the NC@Vo·-RuO2/CNTs-350 with slightly increased sizes is achieved by the partial exposure of RuO2 to air due to the decomposition of the PANI during the calcination. Figure 2d shows that the Vo·-RuO2/CNTs-350 exhibits an ESR signal with the intensity higher than the RuO2/CNTs, but much lower than the NC@Vo·- RuO2/CNTs-350. It validates that the production of more Vo· in the Vo·-RuO2/CNTs-350 is achieved by the reaction of RuO2 with carbon both in the PANI and the CNTs. Figure 2f shows that the TGA curve of the Vo·-RuO2/CNTs-350 is greatly different from that of the NC@Vo·-RuO2/CNTs-350, in which a new weight loss at 150–400 °C can be observed. This weight loss can be attributed to the decomposition of the NC shell. The emergence of this weight loss, along with the relatively lower weight percentage

of the residue after the TGA (43.1 vs 46.2 wt%, Figure 2e), further demonstrates the presence of the NC shell in the NC@Vo·- RuO2/CNTs-350.

The specific structure features, which consist of the CNTs supported Vo·-RuO2 NPs with the ultrathin NC coating, make the NC@Vo·-RuO2/CNTs-350 highly active toward the OER. The LSVs in **Figure 3**a show that the NC@Vo·-RuO2/CNTs-350 only needs an overpotential of ≈170.0 mV to drive 10.0 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> (10) for the OER in the acid media. Interestingly, with the high thickness of the PANI or NC shells, the PANI@RuO2/CNTs, the NC@Vo·-RuO2/CNTs-300, and the NC@Vo·-RuO2/CNTs-350(N2) have negligible activities for the OER. It suggests the great importance of the ultrathin NC shell to achieve the higher catalytic activity for the NC@Vo·-RuO2/CNTs-350. The high thicknesses and the hydrophobic nature of the PANI derived shell presumably block the accessibility of the RuO2 NPs to the OER. In the absence of the NC shell, the Vo·-RuO2/CNTs-400, the Vo·-RuO2-500, and Vo·-RuO2/CNTs-350 are active for the OER, but with activities lower than the NC@Vo·-RuO2/CNTs-350. This result further indicates the great importance of the ultrathin NC shell to achieve the high catalytic activity of the NC@Vo·-RuO2/CNTs-350. The ultrathin NC shell makes RuO2 partially exposed and increases the hydrophilicity of the NC@Vo·- RuO2/CNTs-350, which increases the accessibility of RuO2 to the OER and the catalytic activity of the NC@Vo·-RuO2/CNTs-350. Remarkably, the activity of the NC@Vo·-RuO2/CNTs-350 is higher than those of the commercial RuO2 (c-RuO2) (<sup>10</sup> = 308 mV, close to the reported value[5]) and the most catalysts reported recently, such as UFD-RuO2/CC (<sup>10</sup> = 179 mV)[18] and Cu-RuO2 (<sup>10</sup> = 188 mV).[19] It strongly indicates that the

NC@Vo--RuO<sub>2</sub>/CNTs-350 is the best catalyst among those reported recently (Table S1, Supporting Information). We estimated the mass activity of the NC@Vo--RuO<sub>2</sub>/CNTs-350 with respect to Ru (Figure S12, Supporting Information). It shows that at the overpotential of 250 mV, it has a mass activity of 1738.59 A  $g_{\rm Ru}^{-1}$ , which is >110 times higher than that of the c-RuO<sub>2</sub> (15.61 A  $g_{\rm Ru}^{-1}$ ).

The Tafel plots are derived to further evaluate the catalytic activity of the NC@Vo·-RuO<sub>2</sub>/CNTs-350. Figure 3b shows that the OER by the NC@Vo·-RuO<sub>2</sub>/CNTs-350 exhibits a Tafel slope of 38.9 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>, which is lower than those of the Vo·-RuO<sub>2</sub>/CNTs-400 (44.8 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>), the Vo·-RuO<sub>2</sub>-500 (52.0 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>), the Vo·-RuO<sub>2</sub>/CNTs-350 (69.2 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>), and the c-RuO<sub>2</sub> (69.7 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>, close to the reported value<sup>[20]</sup>). It suggests that the OER by the NC@Vo·-RuO<sub>2</sub>/CNTs-350 proceeds in a faster kinetic way. This is in good agreement with the electrochemical impedance (EIS) spectra in Figure 3c. It shows that the NC@Vo·-RuO<sub>2</sub>/CNTs-350 has lower charge transfer resistance (17.2  $\Omega$ ) than the Vo-RuO<sub>2</sub>/CNTs-400 (21.6  $\Omega$ ), the Vo·-RuO<sub>2</sub>-500 (32.7  $\Omega$ ), the Vo-RuO<sub>2</sub>/CNTs-350 (107.0  $\Omega$ ), and the c-RuO<sub>2</sub> (393.0  $\Omega$ ).

The intrinsic activity of the NC@Vo-RuO2/CNTs-350 toward the OER is assessed by the electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) normalized LSVs. Specifically, the ECSA of a catalyst can be extrapolated based on the double layer capacitance  $(C_{\rm dl})$ estimated from its CVs at the different scan rates (Figure S13, Supporting Information). The result indicates that the NC@Vo-RuO<sub>2</sub>/CNTs-350 has an ECSA of 184.7 cm<sup>2</sup>, which is higher than those of the Vo--RuO<sub>2</sub>/CNTs-400 (175.5 cm<sup>2</sup>), the Vo--RuO<sub>2</sub>-500 (140.7 cm<sup>2</sup>), the Vo--RuO<sub>2</sub>/CNTs-350 (28.5 cm<sup>2</sup>), and the c-RuO<sub>2</sub> (19.0 cm<sup>2</sup>). The ECSA-normalized LSVs in Figure 3d show that the NC@Vo-RuO<sub>2</sub>/CNTs-350 only needs an overpotential of 169.0 mV to drive the current density of 0.01 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. This value is much lower than those of the Vo--RuO<sub>2</sub>/CNTs-400 (193.1 mV), the Vo--RuO<sub>2</sub>-500 (212.2 mV), the Vo--RuO<sub>2</sub>/CNTs-350 (252.3 mV), and the c-RuO<sub>2</sub> (237.0 mV). It strongly suggests that the NC@Vo-RuO2/CNTs-350 has a higher intrinsic catalytic activity toward the OER. That is, the single active site of the NC@Vo--RuO2/CNTs-350 can produce more O2 molecules in the same period of time at the given potential. This is well consistent with the estimated turnover frequencies (TOFs) of the catalysts. It shows that the NC@Vo--RuO<sub>2</sub>/CNTs-350 has a TOF value of 0.575 S<sup>-1</sup> at the overpotential of 250 mV, which is larger than those of the Vo-RuO<sub>2</sub>/CNTs-400 (0.167 S<sup>-1</sup>), the Vo-RuO<sub>2</sub>-500 (0.047  $S^{-1}$ ), the Vo-RuO<sub>2</sub>/CNTs-350 (0.005  $S^{-1}$ ), and the c- $RuO_2$  (0.006 S<sup>-1</sup>, close to the reported values<sup>[21]</sup>). The larger size of the RuO<sub>2</sub> NPs and the absence of the NC coating are not favored for the high intrinsic catalytic activity of the catalysts. As shown in Figure 3d, the Vo-RuO<sub>2</sub>/CNTs-350 exhibits even lower intrinsic catalytic activity than the c-RuO2. This observation well demonstrates the great importance of the PANI shell of the PANI@RuO<sub>2</sub>/CNTs in synthesizing the NC@Vo--RuO<sub>2</sub>/CNTs-350 with the smaller size of the RuO2 NPs and the ultrathin NC coating to achieve the high catalytic activity for the OER. Figure S14, Supporting Information, shows that the NC@Vo-RuO<sub>2</sub>/CNTs-350 has the Faradaic efficiency of the OER close to unit over the measured time period.

The stability measurements indicate that the NC@Vo-RuO $_2$ /CNTs-350 is highly stable for the OER. As shown in Figure 3e, no discernible drop in its activity loss can be observed

when the NC@Vo--RuO<sub>2</sub>/CNTs-350 is subjected to the OER for up to 2000 cycles of the CVs. This is in line with the chronopotentiometric tests in Figure 3g, which shows that the NC@Vo-RuO<sub>2</sub>/CNTs-350 only exhibits <15 mV of the overpotential increase for >900 h of the OER test. The stability of the NC@Vo-RuO<sub>2</sub>/CNTs-350 is much higher than those of the c-RuO<sub>2</sub>, the Vo--RuO<sub>2</sub>/CNTs-350, the Vo--RuO<sub>2</sub>/CNTs-400, and the Vo--RuO<sub>2</sub>-500. As shown in Figure 3g, the complete losses of the activities can be observed when the c-RuO<sub>2</sub>, Vo--RuO<sub>2</sub>/CNTs-350, Vo--RuO<sub>2</sub>/CNTs-400, and Vo--RuO<sub>2</sub>-500 are used for the OER after 9, 28, 299, and 189 h, respectively. This result indicates the great role of the ultrathin NC shell in the high stability of the NC@Vo-RuO<sub>2</sub>/CNTs-350. It can protect the RuO<sub>2</sub> NPs from chemical corrosion during the OER. The structure characterizations in Figure S15, Supporting Information indicate that the NC@Vo-RuO<sub>2</sub>/CNTs-350 exhibits a good robustness. The specific structure feature, which consists of the ultrathin NC coated RuO2 NPs on the CNTs, can still be observed in the NC@Vo-RuO<sub>2</sub>/CNTs-350 after 200 h of the OER. No distinguishable degradation of the CNTs and the ultrathin NC shell can be observed. In particular, the presence of Vo· in RuO<sub>2</sub> can still be identified in the Ru 3p and O 1s spectra (Figure 2b,c) of the NC@Vo--RuO<sub>2</sub>/CNTs-350 after the OER tests. The spectra deconvolution indicates that the concentration of Vo· in RuO2 remains relatively constant after the OER test. This is well consistent with the result in the inset of Figure 2d, which shows that the NC@Vo-RuO<sub>2</sub>/CNTs-350 before and after the OER exhibits the comparable ESR signals. To give a stronger support on the high stability of the NC@Vo-RuO<sub>2</sub>/CNTs-350 for the OER, the time-dependent Ru leaching is examined. Figure 3f indicates that the NC@Vo--RuO<sub>2</sub>/CNTs-350 only exhibits  $\approx 3.3\%$  of the Ru leaching after 200 h of the OER test and the leaching of Ru almost levels off with further increase of the testing time. This is greatly different from the c-RuO<sub>2</sub> and the Vo-RuO<sub>2</sub>/CNTs-350, in which 40.1% and 39.4% of the Ru leaching can be detected within a short period of the OER test. Figure S16a, Supporting Information, shows the Ru stability number (S-number) of the NC@Vo--RuO2/CNTs-350, that is, the ratio between the numbers of the evolved O<sub>2</sub> and the leached Ru atoms. It shows that the S-number can reach up to  $\approx$ 4.5  $\times$ 10<sup>6</sup>, when the NC@Vo-RuO<sub>2</sub>/CNTs-350 is used as the OER catalyst for 900 h. In particular, this value is higher than those of other Ru-based electrocatalysts reported. [14a,21a,22] This result further demonstrates that the NC@Vo-RuO<sub>2</sub>/CNTs-350 is a stable catalyst for the acidic OER.

The NC@Vo--RuO<sub>2</sub>/CNTs-350 is also shown to have higher catalytic performance for the OER in the neutral and alkaline media. As indicated in Figure S17a,b, Supporting Information, the NC@Vo--RuO<sub>2</sub>/CNTs-350 only needs overpotentials of 260.0 and 190.0 mV to drive 10 mA cm $^{-2}$  in the neutral and alkaline media, respectively. Both of these values are lower than the PANI@RuO<sub>2</sub>/CNTs, the NC@Vo--RuO<sub>2</sub>/CNTs-300, the Vo--RuO<sub>2</sub>/CNTs-300, the Vo--RuO<sub>2</sub>/CNTs-350(N<sub>2</sub>), the Vo--RuO<sub>2</sub>/CNTs-350, the c-RuO<sub>2</sub>, and the RuO<sub>2</sub> based catalysts reported recently (Table S2, Supporting Information), such as RuO<sub>2</sub>-C-300 ( $\eta_{10,\, \text{neutral}}=320$  mV and  $\eta_{10,\, \text{alkaline}}=270$  mV)  $^{33}$  and Li-IrSe<sub>2</sub> ( $\eta_{10,\, \text{neutral}}=315$  mV and  $\eta_{10,\, \text{alkaline}}=270$  mV).  $^{[23]}$  Again, the NC@Vo--RuO<sub>2</sub>/CNTs-350 exhibits excellent stabilities for the OER in both the neutral and alkaline media. The chronopotentiometric curves in Figure S17c, Supporting

The inset shows the chronopotentiometric curve of Pt/C||NC@Vo--RuO $_2$ /CNTs-350 at 50 and 100 mA cm $^{-2}$ .

Information, indicate that the NC@Vo-RuO<sub>2</sub>/CNTs-350 shows negligible drops in the catalytic activities in both the neutral and alkaline media for up to 150 and 150 h, respectively.

The high activities, together with excellent stabilities, prompt us to directly use the NC@Vo-RuO2/CNTs-350 in water electrolyzers. Figure 4a shows that a water electrolyzer, assembled by using the commercial Pt/C and the NC@Vo--RuO<sub>2</sub>/CNTs-350 (Pt/C||NC@Vo--RuO2/CNTs-350) as the respective cathode and anode catalysts, only needs a potential of 1.45 V (without IR correction) to drive 10.0 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> in the acid media. This value is much lower than that of the Pt/C||c-RuO<sub>2</sub> (1.60 V) and other electrolyzers reported recently.<sup>[5,20]</sup> In particular, the Pt/C||NC@Vo-RuO<sub>2</sub>/CNTs-350 shows the excellent stability for the water electrolysis in the acid media. A negligible increase of the input potential is observed (<35.0 mV), when the Pt/C||NC@Vo-RuO<sub>2</sub>/CNTs-350 is operated at the constant current density of 10.0 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> for >1000 h (Figure 4c). This is contrast to the Pt/C||c-RuO2, in which a complete loss of water electrolysis capability can be observed after <5.0 h of operation. In particular, the Pt/C||NC@Vo--RuO<sub>2</sub>/CNTs-350 also shows excellent stabilities at the higher current densities of 50 and 100 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> (the inset of Figure 4c). No obvious potential increases can be observed when it is operated first at 50 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> for 200 h and then at 100 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> for 150 h, respectively. The structure characterizations reveal that the NC@Vo--RuO2/CNTs-350 well maintains its original structure after 1000 h of the uses in the water electrolyzers at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, in which the ultrathin NC coated RuO2 NPs grown on the CNTs can still be observed (Figure \$18, Supporting Information). In particular, the NC@Vo-RuO2/CNTs-350 after 1000 h of the use in the Pt/C||NC@Vo-RuO<sub>2</sub>/CNTs-350 exhibits the XRD pattern comparable to that before the use (Figure S16b, Supporting Information). These observations strongly indicate that the NC@Vo--RuO<sub>2</sub>/CNTs-350 has an excellent structural stability for practical applications in water electrolyzers. The alteration of the current density has no influence on the performance and stability of the Pt/C||NC@Vo-RuO<sub>2</sub>/CNTs-350. As shown in Figure 4b, with the change of the current densities from 10.0, 20.0, 30.0, and 40.0 to 50.0 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> for three cycles, the input potentials of the Pt/C||NC@Vo-RuO<sub>2</sub>/CNTs-350 are maintained at 1.45, 1.50, 1.54, 1.58, and 1.61 V, respectively. Likewise, the Pt/C||NC@Vo--RuO2/CNTs-350 shows outstanding performance and excellent stabilities for water electrolysis in the neutral and alkaline media. As shown in Figure S19a,b, Supporting Information, the Pt/C||NC@Vo-RuO<sub>2</sub>/CNTs-350 only needs the potentials of 1.46 and 1.52 V to drive 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> in the neutral and alkaline media, respectively. Both of these values are much lower than those of the Pt/C||c- $\mathrm{RuO}_2$  and other electrolyzers reported recently.  $^{[24]}$  The chronopotentiometric curves in Figure S19c, Supporting Information, indicate that no discernible increases of the input potentials can be observed when the Pt/C||NC@Vo--RuO2/CNTs-350 is operated in the neutral and alkaline media for >300 h. This is different from the Pt/C||c-RuO2, which shows the dramatic losses of the activities for water electrolysis within short periods of time (<5.0 h) in both the neutral and alkaline media (Figure S19c, Supporting Information).

The DFT simulations are conducted to gain a deeper understanding on why the NC@Vo·-RuO2/CNTs-350 can exhibit high catalytic activity and excellent stability for the OER.[25] Specifically, to mimic the structure of the NC@Vo·-RuO2/CNTs-350, which consists of the NC coated Vo· rich RuO2 NPs on the CNTs, a slab comprising graphene supported RuO2(110) with surface half-covered by a carbon monolayer (CL@RuO2(110)/G) has been built (**Figure 5**a). The selection of the RuO2(110) is because it is the most stable surface of RuO2. [14d,15a] In such a structural model, the graphene layer is used to simulate the CNT supporting, while the half-coverage of the RuO2(110)/G surface with the carbon monolayer (CL) is to simulate the NC coating with the partial exposure of RuO2. In particular, the graphenecovered part of the RuO2(110) surface is terminated with both Ru and O. As discussed above, the coating of the NC would lead to the reaction of surface O atoms with carbon, producing the Vo· in the RuO2 NPs. The exposed part of the RuO2(110) is terminated with protonated O. This is based on the observation that the peak corresponding to –OH can be clearly observed in the O 1s spectrum of the NC@Vo·-RuO2/CNTs-350 (Figure 2c). The structural relaxation shows the bending of the CL and the carbon atoms at the edge of the CL shift close to the Ru atoms at the surface of the RuO2(110). The average length of Ru–C is ≈2.12 Å, slightly larger than that of Ru–O (≈1.98 Å). It suggests the bonding between Ru and C. The AEM, which consists of four elementary steps involving the sequential formation of \*OH, \*O, \*OOH, and O2, was first adopted to evaluate the catalytic activities of the CL@RuO2(110)/G toward the OER (Figure 5b). As depicted in Figure 5a, the most active site for the OER on the CL@RuO2(110)/G is Ru at the exposed surface side of RuO2(110) (marked with a broken circle). Figure 5c shows the calculated free energy diagram of the OER by the CL@RuO2(110)/G. It indicates that the transformation of O\* to \*OOH is the rate-determining step of the OER by the CL@RuO2(110)/G. It has an energy barrier of 1.77 eV. This energy barrier is much lower than that of the pristine RuO2(110) (2.13 eV), which takes the transformation of O\* to \*OOH as the rate-determining step of the OER as well (Figure 5c). This finding indicates that the CL@RuO2(110)/G has a higher catalytic activity for the OER than the RuO2(110). It well explains why the NC@Vo·-RuO2/CNTs-350 exhibits much higher catalytic activity for the OER than the c-RuO2.

Charge distribution analysis has been carried out to further elucidate why the CL@RuO2(110)/G can exhibit high activity for the OER.[25c] The local charge integral curve in Figure 5d shows that with the presence of the graphene supporting and CL coating layer, the transfer of charge from the RuO2(110) to graphene and CL occurs. This charge transfer increases the oxidation states of Ru at the active site, which is conducive to enhance the catalytic activity of the CL@RuO2(110)/G. As reported previously, the high Ru oxidation state can improve the oxidizing ability and the OER performance of RuO2. [18] In particular, the occurrence of the charge transfer from the RuO2(110) to graphene and CL can be experimentally verified by the observation that the Ru 3p3/2 peaks of the NC@Vo·-RuO2/CNTs-350 appear at **[www.advancedsciencenews.com](http://www.advancedsciencenews.com) [www.advenergymat.de](http://www.advenergymat.de)**

the binding energies higher than those of the Vo·-RuO2-500 (Figure S20, Supporting Information), which is demonstrated to be free of the CNTs and the NC shell. Additionally, our DFT calculations indicate that Vo· is not in favor of high catalytic activity of the CL@RuO2(110)/G, since its presence will decrease the Ru oxidation state of RuO2. But the presence of Vo·, especially surface Vo·, can strengthen the electronic couplings between RuO2 and CL/G, which is conducive to the transfer of more charges from RuO2 to CL/G. Based on these results, it makes clear that the higher catalytic activity of the NC@Vo·-RuO2/CNTs-350 mainly benefits from the electronic coupling between RuO2 and CNTs/NC, and the presence of Vo· can strengthen this electronic coupling. Figure S21, Supporting Information, shows the project density of states of the CL@RuO2(110)/G. It indicates that the CL@RuO2(110)/G has a non-zero DOS at the Fermi level, which suggests that the CL@RuO2(110)/G has a good electric conductivity and is conducive to the electron transfer during the OER. The O p-band center (p) has been widely used as a descriptor in predicting intrinsic OER activities of oxides.[26] Our DFT calculation indicates that the CL@RuO2(110)/G has a <sup>p</sup> of −3.32 eV, which is closer to the Fermi level than the RuO2(110) (<sup>p</sup> = −3.47 eV, Figure S21, Supporting Information). This further demonstrates that the CL@RuO2(110)/G can exhibit the higher catalytic activity for the OER.

Recent work has suggested the possibility of the OER through the lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM), which is able to deliver higher OER activity than the AEM in some oxide catalysts.[13a,14d] In this work, the potential of the OER by the CL@RuO2(110)/G through the LOM has been calculated. The result indicates that the rate-determining potential of the OER by CL@RuO2(110)/G is 3.40 eV (Figure S22, Supporting Information), which is 1.63 eV higher than that by the AEM. It suggests that the OER by the NC@Vo·-RuO2/CNTs-350 is energetically more favorable through the AEM. Additionally, the calculations show that in the case of the CL@RuO2(110)/G, the energy costs of the Ru demetallation and deoxygenation (3.72 and 0.85 eV) are both higher than those of the RuO2(110) (2.55 and 0.80 eV) (Figure S23, Supporting Information). This indicates that the electronic coupling between RuO2 and CNTs/NC can improve the stability of the lattice oxygen and surface Ru against the chemical corrosion. It well explains why the NC@Vo·-RuO2/CNTs-350 exhibits the excellent stability for the acidic OER.

## **3. Conclusions**

In summary, the NC@Vo·-RuO2/CNTs-350, which consists of the ultrathin NC coated RuO2 NPs on the CNTs, has been synthesized by the controlled calcination of the PANI@RuO2/CNTs in air. The NC@Vo·-RuO2/CNTs-350 shows the high catalytic activity and excellent stability for the OER. It only needs the overpotential of ≈170.0 mV to drive 10.0 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> in the acid media, which is overwhelmingly lower than those of the c-RuO2 and the most RuO2-based catalysts reported recently. Its mass activity is *>*110 times higher than that of the c-RuO2. In particular, the NC@Vo·- RuO2/CNTs-350 shows the outstanding stability. No distinguishable activity loss can be observed when it is used for OER for *>*900 h. The NC@Vo·-RuO2/CNTs-350 also shows the super-high catalytic activities and excellent stabilities for the OER in the neutral and alkaline media. The DFT calculations indicate that the high catalytic activity of the NC@Vo·-RuO2/CNTs-350 mainly arises from the strong electronic coupling between the NC/CNTs and the RuO2 NPs, which increases the oxidation state and catalytic activity of Ru at the active site and improves the stabilities of lattice oxygen and surface Ru during the OER processes. The presence of Vo· can strengthen the electronic coupling between the NC/CNTs and the RuO2 NPs. The results shown in this work is therefore of great interest. It does not only present a new OER catalyst with super-high activity and excellent stability, but also provide a new avenue for design and synthesis of OER catalysts of high performance for practical applications.

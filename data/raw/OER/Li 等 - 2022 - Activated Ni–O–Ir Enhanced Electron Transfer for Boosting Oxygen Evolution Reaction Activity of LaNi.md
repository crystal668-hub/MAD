**Tuning the structure of the active center of catalysts to atomic level provides the most efficient utilization of the active component, which plays an especially important role for precious metals. In this study, the liquid phase ion exchange method is used to introduce atomic Ir into LaNiO3 perovskite oxide, which shows excellent catalytic performance in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The catalyst, LaNi0.96Ir0.04O3, with the optimal concentration of Ir, displays an overpotential of just 280 mV at 10 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> . The introduced Ir enriches the surface electron density significantly, which not only improves site-to-site electron transfer between O and Ni sites but also allows stable adsorption of the intermediates. The results of cyclic voltammetry tests reveal the superior overpotential and remarkable efficiency of the OER process because of the strong interactions in Ni–O–Ir. Moreover, the Ir atom inhibits the participation of a lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism (LOM) in LaNiO3 that guarantees the stability of the catalyst in alkaline conditions. It is anticipated that this work will be instrumental for the preparation and study of a broad range of atomic metal-doped perovskite oxides for water splitting.**

## **1. Introduction**

Developing sustainably clean energy and novel electrochemical energy-storage systems are necessary steps for updating energy conversion devices and promoting clean fuel production.[1] Among the methods so far developed, the electrocatalytic water splitting is considered to be one of the most promising renewable energy technologies available for clean fuel production.[2] However, the kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are sluggish due to the four-electron/four-proton transition process, resulting in a high overpotential of the OER on anodes.[3] To address this challenge, a series of electrocatalysts have been investigated including precious metals iridium- and rutheniumbased materials, which show outstanding performance and excellent activity for OER, but their high cost and scarcity

severely hamper their large-scale application.[4] Therefore, considerable efforts have been devoted to designing OER catalysts with low-cost and high catalytic activity in order to reduce or replace the use of precious metals.[5]

Recently, perovskites ABO3 (A = rare or alkaline-earth metal, B = transition metal) with excellent structural flexibility, high intrinsic activities, and tunable electronic structures, are regarded as a low-cost alternative to precious metals and have demonstrated great potential as efficient OER catalysts in alkaline medium.[6] However, the electrocatalytic performance of most unmodified perovskite oxides is far inferior to that of precious metals due to the deficiency of active sites, which inspired us to develop efficient strategies for structure optimization. Over the past few years, numerous methods, such as cation doping,[7] defect engineering,[8] hybridization,[9] and strain,[10] have been investigated to enhance their electrochemical catalytic abilities. Among them, regulation of the electronic structures of perovskite oxides by heteroatom doping, especially metal cation doping, is a facile and indispensable strategy for stabilizing phase structures, thereby strengthening their electrochemical performance. Wu and coworkers examined the OER performance of La2NiMnO6 nanoparticles, and highlighted a phenomenon that redistributes the d electron configuration in B-site cations from a Mn4+–O– Ni2+ static super-exchange effect to a Mn3+–O–Ni3+ vibronic super-exchange effect.[7c] An optimized Sn-doped LaNiO3 catalyst showed favorable stability with an overpotential of

318 mV at 10 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2 for OER reported by Chen and coworkers.[7d] More recently, a Fe-doped perovskite LaNi1-xFexO3 synthesized by Dong and co-workers demonstrated bimetallic active sites at the B-site have and possess the synergistic effect of promoting electron rearrangement, improving the intrinsic activity of the catalyst.[7e] These cases remind us that doping is an efficient way to improve the OER performance of perovskite, but it is undeniable that the improvement is limited in some cases.[11] Thus, we envisioned that tuning the size of the highly active center to the atomic level would allow for greater exposure of electrochemically active sites and the maximization of atom utilization efficiency. However, the synthesis of perovskite oxides is usually accomplished at high temperatures, while the surface free energy of these materials increases sharply with the decreasing atomic size, and dispersed metal atoms are easy to sinter at high temperatures. It remains extremely difficult in practice to install atomic metals in LaNiO3, which is located on the top of the OER volcano activity chart and is predicted to exhibit a low overpotential.[12] Therefore, a reasonable and pragmatic synthetic method for the production of atomic-level metal-doped perovskite oxides is urgently needed.

Herein, we propose a general bottom-up wet chemical synthetic method for the efficient preparation of a series of atomically dispersed Ir-doped perovskite oxides LaNi1-xIrxO3 (x = 0.02 and 0.04). This strategy involves a two-step procedure, including the preparation of precursor LaNiO3 powders via hydrothermal reactions and subsequent introduction of low-dose atomic-level Ir. Remarkably, this method effectively avoids the sintering of atomic-level metal in the process of perovskite synthesis. The porous nanocube morphology favors exposing more active sites while retaining the original lattice ordering of LaNiO3. The optimized LaNi0.96Ir0.04O3 shows excellent electrocatalytic activity with an overpotential of 280 mV at *j* = 10 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2 in alkaline OER electrocatalysis, and exhibits a turnover frequency (TOF) of 1.17 at 1.55 VRHE, which is higher than that of commercial IrO2 catalysts. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the Ir introduced at the atomic level activates the electroactivity of surface Ni and low-coordinated O sites, which enhances Ni–O–Ir electron transfer on the electrocatalyst surface as well as to the intermediates. The improved electron transfer from the electrocatalyst to the adsorbates, facilitated by the Ir atom, is the key factor for realizing efficient intermediate conversions with low energy barriers at the rate-determining step (RDS) of the OER. Importantly, this synthetic process is highly versatile and may pave the way for the rational design of new and highly effective perovskite oxide OER catalysts.

## **2. Results and Discussion**

#### **2.1. Materials Preparation**

The perovskite oxides with atomically dispersed Ir doping were obtained after exploration and optimization of the experimental conditions. First, we attempted to synthesize the target atomic-level Ir-doped LaNiO3 catalyst LaNi1-xIrxO3 via a onestep (OS) procedure using a universal sol–gel (SG) method. Unsurprisingly, the linear scan voltammogram (LSV) measurements indicated that OSSG-LaNiIrO3 possesses a low electrocatalytic ability. We speculate that this is because the high temperature makes the dispersed metal atoms sintered during synthesis. A step-by-step procedure was then designed, which included the preparation of SG-LaNiO3 before the introduction of the Ir atom. The OER reactivity was significantly improved compared with OSSG-LaNiIrO3 (Figure S1, Supporting Information). Unfortunately, a disadvantage of the SG method emerged, which is that the scarcity of surfactant active sites brings about a general result. We therefore, proposed a multistep procedure composing a synthesis of a LaNiO3 precursor via a hydrothermal (H) method prior to metal introduction. To our delight, the as-prepared LaNiIrO3 powders possessed satisfactory structures and electrochemical properties. In addition, we synthesized OSH-LaNiIrO3 via an OS hydrothermal procedure for comparison, which showed similar outcomes to OSSG-LaNiIrO3 (Figure S2, Supporting Information). To compare the experimental results, Ir nanoparticles (Nps) LaNiO3 was synthesized using Ir nanoparticles and the LaNiO3 precursor under standard conditions (Supporting Information, Section 1.4).

#### **2.2. Structural Identification of Atomic Ir Species**

Following condition optimization, the overall method for the formation of LaNi1-xIrxO3 (x = 0.02 and 0.04) is illustrated in Scheme S1 (Supporting Information). The LaNiO3 nanocubes as precursor were first synthesized via a hydrothermal method before being calcined in oxygen atmosphere.[13] Subsequently, the Ir-doped LaNi1-xIrxO3 was readily prepared by simple thermal dispersion using the pre-prepared nanocubes and different molar ratios of IrCl3. [14] The corresponding crystal structure is depicted in **Figure 1**a, and the actual amount of Ir doping was determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) (Table S1, Supporting Information). According to the powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns for the as-prepared nanocubes shown in Figure 1b, each sample had the typical reflections associated with rhombohedral LaNiO3 (JCPDF 34–1028), indicating that the powder LaNiO3 samples were successfully obtained and, with the introduction of Ir ions, no other impurity peaks appeared. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was then used to characterize the morphology of the materials. The LaNiO3 precursor exhibited a uniform nanocube structure, which was transformed to an irregular porous morphology when calcined (Figure S3, Supporting Information). It is worth noting that the introduction of Ir did not destroy the initial structure of the perovskite oxides (Figure S4, Supporting Information). Further characterization of LaNiO3 was carried out using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), in which lattice fringes with an interplanar distance of 0.268 nm were observed, corresponding to the (110) crystallographic plane (Figure S5, Supporting Information). Following the introduction of Ir, these lattice fringes expanded to 0.284 nm because Ir3+ (0.68 Å) possesses a greater ionic radius than Ni3+ (0.48 Å), which indicated that Ir atoms were likely doped into the LaNiO3, rather than staying on the outer surface (Figure S6b, Supporting Information).

Similar results were also observed in the LaNi0.98Ir0.02O3 and Ir Nps-LaNiO3 catalysts (Figure S6, Supporting Information). The dispersion of Ir atoms was confirmed by representative aberration-corrected high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM), in which bright contrast spots were identified as Ir atoms (Figure S7, Supporting Information).[15] Moreover, the periodic brightness contrast of all atomic columns in the image shown in Figure 1c is closely correlated with the ordering of the atomic number of the cations. Figure 1d presents an enlarged view of the region marked white in Figure 1c, where it can be seen that the atomic Ir leads to a higher intensity and broader lattice fringe in the intensity profile analysis, which is in good agreement with our experimental HRTEM results.[16] As revealed by HAADF-STEM mapping (Figure 1e), the element distributions are highly even.

X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra were employed to reveal long-range structural insights into the Ir species. The XANES test at the Ir L3-edge (Figure 1f) shows that the white line intensities of LaNi0.96Ir0.04O3 and LaNi0.98Ir0.02O3 were between that of the standard reference IrO2 and that of Ir foil, which indicated the coexistence of Ir<sup>0</sup> species and positively charged Ir species. Also, the apparent valence states were fitted and are shown in the inset to Figure 1f, and the results for LaNi0.96Ir0.04O3, LaNi0.98Ir0.02O3,

and Ir Nps-LaNiO<sub>3</sub> indicated values of +3.15, +3.72, and +2.63, respectively.<sup>[17]</sup> This is finding consistent with the results obtained from X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) for Ir 4f photoemission features (Figure 1g), of which commercial IrO2 exhibits two peaks with Ir 4f doublet splitting energy of 3.08 eV for Ir  $4f_{7/2}$  at 62.28 eV and Ir  $4f_{5/2}$  at 65.36 eV. The Ir 4f peaks of LaNi<sub>0.96</sub>Ir<sub>0.04</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and LaNi<sub>0.98</sub>Ir<sub>0.02</sub>O<sub>3</sub> exhibited 0.17 and 0.24 eV positive shifts, respectively, relative to IrO<sub>2</sub> (Figure S8a, Supporting Information). These results further verified that Ir was successfully doped into the oxide as targeted. Moreover, the peaks located at 67.77 and 69.50 eV in the corresponding Ir Nps-LaNiO<sub>3</sub> spectra are from Ni 3p, indicating the strong interaction between Ir Nps and LaNiO<sub>3</sub> (Figure S8b, Supporting Information). In the Fourier transform (FT) of the EXAFS spectrum of the Ir L<sub>3</sub>-edge (Figure 1h), two intensity peaks located at 1.8 Å<sup>-1</sup> were similar to the counterpart observed in the IrO2 spectrum, the peaks at 1.8 and 2.0 Å<sup>-1</sup> both belonged to the Ir-O path identified by wavelet transform EXAFS (WT-EXAFS) (Figure S9, Supporting Information).[18] This result also revealed that no Ir-Ir scattering could be found in LaNi<sub>0.96</sub>Ir<sub>0.04</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and LaNi<sub>0.98</sub>Ir<sub>0.02</sub>O<sub>3</sub> compared with Ir foil. These results clearly indicate the exclusively atomic dispersion of Ir within the LaNiO3 lattice.

#### 2.3. Structure Tuning of LaNi<sub>0.96</sub>Ir<sub>0.04</sub>O<sub>3</sub>

As a result of the electroneutrality principle, the incorporation of Ir inevitably induces the valence transition of B-sites. Necessarily, in order to determine the surface oxidation states of materials for Ni 2p, La 3d, and O 1s, XPS analysis was carried out. As shown in Figure 2a, there are two core-level peaks at 854.7 and 833.7 eV, corresponding to Ni  $2p_{3/2}$  + La  $3d_{3/2}$  and La  $3d_{5/2}$ in LaNiO<sub>3</sub> and other prominent shakeup satellite peaks, respectively.[19] With Ir embedded, the spectra are shifted to higher binding energies, suggesting changes in the electron cloud density of La and the oxidation state of Ni. Nevertheless, it is still difficult to calculate the ratio of Ni<sup>2+</sup> and Ni<sup>3+</sup> due to the overlap of Ni 2p<sub>3/2</sub> and La 3d<sub>3/2</sub>.<sup>[19b]</sup> Hence, XANES fitting of the Ni K-edge was performed (Figure 2c). According to the edge positions, we concluded that the valence of the Ni cations in LaNiO3 was 3+. The Ni K-edges edge positions exhibited negative chemical shifts following Ir trapping, indicating that the valence of Ni<sup>3+</sup> was partially reduced. The XPS spectra of O 1s can be deconvoluted into four characteristic peaks (Figure 2b): the O1 peak at approximately 529.0 eV was ascribed to a lattice O<sup>2-</sup> anion in the lanthanum oxides; the peak O2 located at 530.4 eV was considered to be a lattice O<sup>2-</sup> anion in the nickel oxides, and an

additional spectral component O3 at about 531.8 eV was attributed to La and Ni hydroxides.<sup>[20]</sup> Typically, the binding energy (BE) of O 1s is 2.0 eV higher than that of the associated lattice oxygen. The supplementary O4 peak at approximately 533.6 eV was ascribed to adsorbed water species. We can directly observe that Ir doping was beneficial for the O3 increase (Figure S10, Supporting Information), which is beneficial for the OER catalytic activity (Table S2, Supporting Information). Thus, we concluded that the Ni 2p and Ir 4f peak shifts suggest their strong interaction and the partial electron transfer from Ir to Ni, probably via the O bridge (Figure 2d), which is consistent with the electronegativity of these ions reported in the literature. Such electron transfer could possibly change the electronic structure of the catalyst and then manipulate the intrinsic activity during the electrocatalytic process. Subsequently, the local atomic structure of Ni was analyzed using EXAFS spectroscopy, and the results indicated the complex and similar nature of Ni in the synthesized compound (Figure 2e).<sup>[21]</sup> By checking the FT-EXAFS of Ni (Figure 2f), we found the same location of Ni-O peaks and Ni-M peaks following the introduction of Ir, compared with LaNiO<sub>3</sub>. This reveals the circumventing of LaNiO<sub>3</sub>ordered lattice breaking, which also supported the XRD results (Figure 1b). Furthermore, two intensity maxima, at approximately 1.5 and 3 Å, can be observed in the WT-EXAFS images of LaNiO<sub>3</sub> (Figure 2g), which can be assigned to the Ni-O and Ni-M contributions. A negligible variation in peak position was observed in LaNi<sub>0.96</sub>Ir<sub>0.04</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, which reveals that the ordering of Ni cations over the perovskite B-sites was maintained following Ir trapping.

#### 2.4. Electrochemical OER Performance

The electrocatalytic performances of LaNi<sub>0.96</sub>Ir<sub>0.04</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and LaNi<sub>0.98</sub>Ir<sub>0.02</sub>O<sub>3</sub> were evaluated using LSV in 1 м KOH solution at room temperature. Compared with pure LaNiO3 and IrO2,  $LaNi_{1-x}Ir_xO_3$  (x = 0.02 and 0.04) exhibit significantly better catalytic performance. As shown in Figure 3a,b, with the increase of Ir doping amount, the catalytic activities of LaNi<sub>1.v</sub>Ir<sub>v</sub>O<sub>3</sub> were first improved and then reached an optimum value (only 280 mV at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>) at x = 0.04. However, a further increase in the amount of Ir (Ir Nps-LaNiO3) led to a deterioration in the OER performance, which was ascribed to the low utilization of Ir. To further evaluate the electrocatalytic activity of the catalysts, the electrochemical double-layer capacitance (C<sub>dl</sub>)<sup>[22]</sup> was measured (Figure S11, Supporting Information), showing that LaNi<sub>0.96</sub>Ir<sub>0.04</sub>O<sub>3</sub> (26.6 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>) had more effective active sites compared with LaNiO<sub>3</sub> (6.61 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>); thus, Ir can enhance site activity effectively. With increasing Ir content, the C<sub>dl</sub> decreased and the performance of OER was reduced.

It is well known that the TOFs, corresponding to the intrinsic per site activity of catalysts, are the best figure of merit for comparing activities among different catalysts. Herein, the TOF per metal site was calculated based on the hypothesis that all Ir active centers were accessible to the electrolyte. Accordingly, the TOF values per Ir site of LaNi<sub>0.96</sub>Ir<sub>0.04</sub>O<sub>3</sub> were calculated. TOF plots against the applied overpotential are summarized (Figure 3c), demonstrating a linear increase. In particular, the TOFs of  $LaNi_{0.96}Ir_{0.04}O_3$  were 1.17  $O_2$  per second at 1.55  $V_{RHE}$ , which is

two orders of magnitude higher than IrO2 (inset in Figure 3c) and is higher than those previously reported for nickel-based electrocatalysts.<sup>[23]</sup> The Tafel slopes were calculated to evaluate the OER kinetics, as shown in Figure S12 (Supporting Information). Compared with LaNiO<sub>3</sub>, LaNi<sub>1-x</sub>Ir<sub>x</sub>O<sub>3</sub> (x = 0.02 and 0.04) possessed lower Tafel slopes, indicating that the reaction kinetics can be enhanced by Ir doping. This also revealed that  $LaNi_{0.96}Ir_{0.04}O_3$  endows the lowest Tafel slope (62 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>). Ir can induce and optimize the active site to improve electron mobility. Charge-transfer resistance may be the reason for the trend observed in the Tafel slopes. Hence, we measured the resistance of the catalysts by means of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) at 1.525 V<sub>RHE</sub> and 10 mV potential bias (Figure S13, Supporting Information). The arcs of the EIS spectra represent a positive correlation with the charge-transfer resistance  $(R_{ct})$  of the electrocatalysts. Furthermore, this trend is basically consistent with the trend for the Tafel slope. In addition to high OER activity, durability is another important criterion for a practical catalyst. For this reason, we carried out a chronopotentiometry test (Figure S14a, Supporting Information), and LaNi<sub>0.96</sub>Ir<sub>0.04</sub>O<sub>3</sub> was found to be significantly more stable than LaNiO<sub>3</sub> at a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. The same conclusion was reached according to the results of a multi-potential step stability test (Figure S14b, Supporting Information).

To verify the electronic environment during the reaction coordinates of OER, we have plotted the projected partial density of states (PDOS) of the most stable binding of key intermediates. [24] The  $\sigma$  components of p orbitals are critical to revealing the electron transfer process of adsorbed intermediates while the normal p- $\pi$  orbitals demonstrate the electroactivity of local O sites in the structure. From the alkaline solution toward the final product  $O_2$ , the gradual upshifting of the  $\sigma$  orbitals is consistent with the oxidation process of OER. More importantly, such an upshifting of the  $\sigma$  orbitals demonstrates the efficient electron transfer with low barriers for intermediates transformation. which is consistent with the highly efficient OER reaction trend (Figure 3d). On the other hand, the energy trend for the OER process was calculated to evaluate the required overpotential. When the applied potential is zero, the overall OER process displays a continuous uphill trend, indicating the barrier for each step. The largest barrier of 1.49 eV is the reaction from [\*O + 2OH $^-$  + H<sub>2</sub>O] to [\*OOH + OH $^-$  + H $_2$ O], indicating the RDS. The last step to generate O<sub>2</sub> from the dehydrogenation of \*OOH shows a slightly smaller barrier of 1.46 eV (Figure 3e). When we impose the equilibrium potential of 1.23 V, we notice the valley shape of the energetic reaction trend. The reaction of OER becomes spontaneous from the initial OH- to the formation of O\*. The overpotential of the RDS is correspondingly estimated as 0.26 eV, which is in good agreement with the experimental results. Therefore, the remarkable performance of LaNi<sub>1-x</sub>Ir<sub>x</sub>O<sub>3</sub> originates from the strengthened electron transfer of the surface by the introduction of Ir, which guarantees a low overpotential to achieve OER in alkaline environments (Figure 3f).

#### 2.5. Insights into OER

To further investigate the underlying origins of the superior OER performance, DFT calculations were applied to reveal

the local electronic structures and reaction trends. For pristine LaNiO3, it was noted that the bonding and anti-bonding orbitals near the Fermi level (EF) were evenly distributed near the surface, especially on the Ni and O sites (Figure S15a, Supporting Information). With the replacement type of Ir atoms on the Ni sites, the surface electronic structure has evidently been modulated, which becomes much richer focusing on the Ir and nearby Ni, leading to a higher electroactivity (Figure S15b, Supporting Information). The detailed electronic structure of LaNi0.96Ir0.04O3 has been demonstrated by PDOS. Notably, the La-5d orbitals only show the contribution to the conduction band, which mainly plays a role in stabilizing the lattice structure. Ni–3d orbitals are located close to the EF at *E*V− 0.9 eV (*E*<sup>V</sup> = 0 eV), indicating the fast electron transfer capability. Oxygen sites exhibit broads, and p bands crossing the EF. We also noticed that the introduced Ir atom demonstrates broad 5d orbitals, covering from EV− 8.0 eV to the EF. Therefore, Ni 3d, O s, p, and Ir 5d both cross the EF, and there is significant covalent interaction between Ni–O–Ir, which boosts up the site-to-site electron transfer and might be the reason for the continuous improvement of OER performance (**Figure 4**a).

A detailed site-to-site PDOS of each element is also presented (Figure 4b). For the La 5d sites, we notice that the pinned 5d orbitals from the bulk to the surface with limited change, which further confirms their significant role in preserving the high stability of the OER environment. Meanwhile, the dominant peak of the Ni–3d orbitals shows a slight upshifting of 0.48 eV from the bulk sites to the surface sites, indicating high electroactivity on the surface due to the optimization of the electronic structure by the nearby Ir sites. The oxygen sites have demonstrated an evident site-to-site change in the PDOS. The s, p orbitals near the surface gradually shift toward the EF to support O site activation. The upshifting of the p-band center of surface O sites with low coordination shows much-improved electron transfer towards the nearby Ni and Ir sites, which further reinforces the binding of intermediates in OER (Figure 4b).

On the basis of DFT calculations, a cyclic voltammetry (CV) test was employed in order to verify the interaction in Ni–O–Ir. After comparing the CV curves of LaNiO3 and LaNi0.96Ir0.04O3, we found that the only pair of redox peaks existed in the initial LaNiO3, while there were two reduction peaks that emerged after the introduction of Ir, which belong to Ni4+–Ni3+, Ni3<sup>+</sup>–Ni2<sup>+</sup> (Figure 4c,d).[25] The unique redox behavior is consistent with the improvement in electron transfer between Ni and O following the Ir introduction shown in the DFT calculations; this redox property may also be the reason for the valence state invariance of Ni during the catalytic process (Figure S16, Supporting Information). In addition, when comparing the redox behavior of LaCoIrO3 and LaFeIrO3, we found that the redox degree was related to the OER performance. Specifically, there was only one reduction peak for Co (Figure 4e) and almost no redox peak for Fe (Figure 4f) after the CV test, compared with pure LaCoO3 and LaFeO3 (Figure S17a,b, Supporting Information), a result that indicates that the degree of interaction decreases in the order: Ni–O–Ir > Co–O–Ir > Fe–O–Ir, which is consistent with the OER performance (Figure S17c, Supporting Information). In sum, the evidence revealed by combining the CV and DFT results shows that the strong Ni–O–Ir interaction is the origin of high OER activity.

To determine the actual active site, we investigated the near-surface electronic structure of samples during OER by quasi-operando XPS. The Ni 2p, O 1s, and Ir 4f XPS spectra are shown in Figures S18–S20 (Supporting Information). The Ir spectra of LaNi0.96Ir0.04O3 and Ir Nps-LaNiO3 show different trends, the former increases to 1.35 VRHE before suddenly decreasing at 1.40 VRHE, and then remaining constant (**Figure 5**a; Figure S20a, Supporting Information), while the latter keeps increasing (Figure S20b, Supporting Information). This jump in BD is thought to be the primary oxidation state of Ir from 3 to 4. Moreover, we observed that the BD of Ni does not shift significantly at different applied potentials in different samples (Figure 5b; Figure S18, Supporting Information). Based on these results, we still cannot tell which is the active site. Thus, after running the chronopotentiometry test, we reexamined the catalysts and found that these catalysts still maintained the original crystal structure according to XRD and TEM measurements (Figures S21 and S22, Supporting Information). Furthermore, the XPS spectrum indicated that the valence state of Ni changed in LaNiO3, but remained unchanged after Ir introduction (Figures S16 and S23, Supporting Information), which may be attributed to the transformation of the active site.

Thus, it is reasonable to conclude that Ir is indeed the active site during OER process.

To further explore the catalytic process of OER, in situ attenuated total reflection infrared (ATR-IR) spectroelectrochemical measurements were used to capture the reaction intermediates (Figure 5c). [26] In the spectra of LaNiO<sub>3</sub> (Figure 5d), we assigned two peaks to oxygen-related species adsorbed on the catalysts. One band at 1210 cm<sup>-1</sup>was assigned to the O–O stretching mode of surface-adsorbed superoxide (OOH<sub>ad</sub>), the other band at 1110 cm<sup>-1</sup> was attributed to the O–O bending mode. [27] In contrast, there was only one band at 1210 cm<sup>-1</sup> in the LaNi<sub>0.96</sub>Ir<sub>0.04</sub>O<sub>3</sub> spectrum (Figure 5e). Therefore, we suggest that Ir inhibits the participation of lattice oxygen atoms. To further investigate this result, we conducted in situ differential electrochemical mass spectroscopy (DEMS) measurements using the isotope <sup>18</sup>O. [28] We labeled the catalyst

surface with <sup>18</sup>O and measured the evolved O2 during OER. The amount of <sup>34</sup>O<sub>2</sub> and <sup>36</sup>O<sub>2</sub> evolved reflected the participation of lattice oxygen (34O2 coming from the combination of <sup>18</sup>O in the lattice and <sup>16</sup>O in the water and <sup>36</sup>O<sub>2</sub> coming from <sup>18</sup>O). The ratio of lattice oxygen generated on LaNi<sub>0.96</sub>Ir<sub>0.04</sub>O<sub>3</sub> is lower than that on LaNiO3 (Figure 5f,g; Figure S24, Supporting Information) It has been reported that weak bonding of lattice oxygen may enable direct participation in the OER and make it more prone to dissolution. We also calculated the dissolution of cations of Ni in LaNiO3 and LaNio96Iro04O3 during the electrochemical tests. The ICP-MS are shown in Figure S25 (Supporting Information). In the early stage (0-2 cycles), Ni dissolution is observed. [29] Interestingly, in the following cycles, the dissolution of Ni from LaNi<sub>0.96</sub>Ir<sub>0.04</sub>O<sub>3</sub> was almost unchanged, but kept increasing in LaNiO3. These results demonstrated that the introduction of Ir is beneficial

for improving the stability of the structure, which is in agreement with the DEMS results. Therefore, the strong interactions in these Ni–O–Ir local structures suppress lattice oxygen involvement during OER, thus improving the stability of the electrocatalyst.

# **3. Conclusion**

In conclusion, we have demonstrated the synthesis and characterization of atomic-level Ir doped into perovskite oxide, in which LaNi0.96Ir0.04O3 gives rise to prominent OER performance in alkaline media through optimized electron transfer in Ni–O–Ir. LaNi0.96Ir0.04O3 exhibits an overpotential of 280 mV at *j* = 10 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> in alkaline OER electrocatalysis, and shows TOFs of 1.17 at a 1.55 VRHE, which is superior to commercial IrO2. Furthermore, theoretical calculations have shown that superior OER performance is ascribed to Ir atom doping, which enhances Ni–O–Ir electron transfer on the electrocatalyst surface, as well as to the intermediates. With an optimized electronic structure, the appropriate binding strength leads to a low overpotential of OER. In addition, the lower lattice oxygen participation of LaNi0.96Ir0.04O3 ensures improved stability. This shows the operability of adjusting atomic doping levels to prompt the exploration of more active sites for the further development of highly-efficient perovskite catalysts and deepens insights into the understanding of the major processes of the structural transformation during the OER process. This work will supply critical information for designing advanced electrocatalysts for reversible energy conversion systems.

**Abstract:** The catalytic activity of MnO<sup>2</sup> nanosheets towards oxygen evolution depends highly on their interlayer environment. We present a systematic investigation on fine-tuning of the interlayer environment of MnO<sup>2</sup> nanosheets by intercalation through a facile cation exchange with inexpensive first-row transition metal cations, including Ni2+, Co2+ , Cu2+, Zn2+, and Fe3+ ions. Among them, the Ni-intercalated MnO<sup>2</sup> nanosheets show remarkably enhanced OER activity and long-term stability, compared to pristine MnO<sup>2</sup> nanosheets. The overpotential of 330 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm-2 is observed for the Niintercalated MnO<sup>2</sup> nanosheets. The ehancement mechanism of OER is studied by comparing physiochemical properties, such as the oxidation state of Mn, the interlayer distance, the increase in the disorder/twisting of MnO<sup>6</sup> octahedra, and the interlayer cooperative binding of water molecules. The Ni intercalation, different from other metal cations, strengthens the Mn-O bond perpendicularly to the layer chains to facilitate the interlayer catalysis possibly between two Mn sites, and thus promotes the efficiency of oxygen evolution.

#### **Introduction**

Efficiently converting sustainable and renewable energy (*e.g.,* solar energy) to chemical energy is desirable in the hope of eliminating the use of fossil fuels and transforming our energy supply system.[\[1\]](#page-9-0) Water splitting to H<sup>2</sup> and O<sup>2</sup> has been long recognized as a promising strategy for the mass production of the alternative clean energy, *e.g.,* H2, driven by solar energy or electricity from renewable resources.[\[2\]](#page-9-1) However, the sluggish kinetics and large overpotential of the 4einvolved oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a bottleneck towards overall water splitting.[\[3\]](#page-9-2) Precious metal oxides *e.g.,* RuO<sup>2</sup> and IrO2, among the

best electrocatalysts for OERs, still show a high overpotential (*η,* ˃300 mV) to drive the oxidation of water.[\[4\]](#page-9-3)

Developing more active catalysts in order to lower the energy barrier for OERs has attracted considerable attention over decades. Taking inspiration from nature where the manganesecontaining cluster (Mn4O8Ca) in photosystem II shows extremely high activity with a turnover frequency of 100 s -1 , [\[5\]](#page-9-4) substantial efforts have been devoted to studying inexpensive manganesecontaining catalysts for OERs instead of high-cost precious metal or metal oxides.[\[6\]](#page-9-5) In particular, Mn oxides/hydroxides with different oxidation states such as MnO,[\[7\]](#page-9-6) MnO2, [\[8\]](#page-9-7) Mn2O3, [\[9\]](#page-9-8) MnOOH,[\[10\]](#page-9-9) and complex oxides like Co-, Cu-, Ca-doped MnO<sup>2</sup> [\[3,](#page-9-2)  [11\]](#page-10-0) have been intensively studied in OER catalysis. Among many polymorphs of MnO2, layered Mn oxide (δ-MnO2, or birnessite) consisting of two-dimensional (2D)-layered structures with edgesharing MnO<sup>6</sup> octahedra is a potential candidate for OERs. However, the catalytic activity of bulk δ-MnO<sup>2</sup> is very low among various polymorphs of MnO2. [\[6d,](#page-9-10) [12\]](#page-10-1) The catalytic activity of δ-MnO<sup>2</sup> for the OER is sensitive to the interlayer environment of layered materials. Therefore, the possibility of controlling the interlayer properties by readily exchanging the guest cations with a range of metal cations like K<sup>+</sup> , Na<sup>+</sup> , Mg2+, Zn2+, Ni2+, and Co2+ ions,[\[13\]](#page-10-2) possibly can promote the tunable electrochemical activity for OERs. Kang *et al.*[\[14\]](#page-10-3) and Xiong *et al.*[\[15\]](#page-10-4) demonstrated that the expanded interlayer spacing of MnO<sup>2</sup> nanosheets by intercalating large cations contributed to the increased catalytic activity towards OER and the electrochemical energy storage capacity. Recent studies from Strongin's group showed that the confinement of Cu2+, Co2+, and Ni2+ into the interlayer of birnessite led to the enhancement in the activity towards OER where Co2+/birnessite could achieve 10 mA cm-2 at a low overpotential of 360 mV.[\[16\]](#page-10-5)

MnO<sup>2</sup> nanosheets with single- or few-layers are closely related to bulk δ-MnO2. The ultrathin nanosheets with atomic thickness possess highly accessible surfaces within the interlayers and maximum exposed active sites, thus facilitating interfacial charge transfer and efficient catalysis.[\[17\]](#page-10-6) This enables the MnO<sup>2</sup> nanosheets to gain the extraordinarily improved catalytic activity and high specific capacitance as a pseudocapacitor material compared to their bulk counterparts. Zhao *et al.* reported that ultrathin two-monolayer MnO2nanosheet arrays (1.4 nm) grown on Ni foam exhibited efficient water splitting with a low overpotential of 320 mV at 10 mA cm-2 for OER.[\[18\]](#page-10-7) Recently, single-layer MnO<sup>2</sup> nanosheets prepared and ordered by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) without any exfoliation agents were developed by Liu *et al.*[\[19\]](#page-10-8) The superior specific capacitance of 868 F g −1 at current density of 3 A g−1 and excellent cycling stability (91% retained after 10 000 charge/discharge cycles) was achieved with single-layer MnO<sup>2</sup> nanosheets. Various ultrathin transition metal oxides and hydroxides/oxyhydroxides nanosheets have also drawn tremendous attention other than Mn-

containing materials, for instance γ-CoOOH nanosheets,[\[20\]](#page-10-9) amorphous cobalt-iron hydroxide nanosheets,[\[21\]](#page-10-10) layered double hydroxides,[\[22\]](#page-10-11) α-Ni(OH)2, and NiO nanosheets,[\[23\]](#page-10-12) *etc.* Given the fascinating electronic structure and the largely accessible surface sites, ultrathin nanosheets stand out as one of the most promising candidates as anode materials for OERs.

Herein, we report the intercalation of transition metal cations including Ni2+, Co2+, Cu2+, Zn2+, and Fe3+ ions into the interlayer region of MnO<sup>2</sup> nanosheets via a facile cation exchange approach. A series of characterization techniques such as electron spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Raman spectra, and Fourier-transform infrared spectra are used to confirm the successful intercalation of metal cations and investigate how the intercalation varies the physiochemical

properties of MnO<sup>2</sup> nanosheets. For Ni-intercalated MnO<sup>2</sup> nanosheets, the evidently enhanced OER activity with a significantly lower overpotential of 330 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm-2 and a high TOF of 0.0356 s-1 is achieved, compared to that of pristine MnO<sup>2</sup> nanosheets (*η =* 581 mV). Interestingly, Ni-intercalated MnO<sup>2</sup> nanosheets interlayerly show better activity compared to Ni-doped MnO<sup>2</sup> nanosheets. Multiple factors resulting in the improvement of OER activity were studied in detail, including the oxidation state of Mn, structural disorder caused by metal cations, electron transfer and interlayer cooperative catalysis. The Ni-intercalated MnO<sup>2</sup> nanosheets with dynamically mobile Ni ions can improve the cooperative binding with water through two Mn sites, which is believed to be of great importance for the catalytic activity of MnO<sup>2</sup> nanosheets.

#### **Results**

**Synthesis and Characterization.** The layered MnO<sup>2</sup> nanosheets were synthesized through the reduction of KMnO<sup>4</sup> in the presence of SDS*.* [\[19\]](#page-10-8) As-prepared MnO<sup>2</sup> nanosheets are ultrathin, flaky with an average lateral dimension of 1~5 μm. The typical 2D nanostructures of nanosheets were examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Figure 1a, c). As determined from the warped edges of the nanosheets, the individual nanosheet exhibits a thickness of ~1.4 nm (see the inset of Figure 1b), corresponding to 2-3 layers of nanosheets. The edge height of nanosheets measured by atomic force microscopy (AFM) is around 8 nm (Figure 1j, k). This suggests that MnO<sup>2</sup> nanosheets are flexible and warp when drying onto the substrate; and the edge of the MnO<sup>2</sup> nanosheets can fold/stack with each other as seen in TEM. The metal-intercalated nanosheets were obtained by a simple cation exchange at room temperature due to high capacity of guest cations accommodated in the interlayer region, using metal nitrate salts of Ni2+, Co2+, Cu2+, Zn2+, and Fe3+. Those intercalated materials are denoted as M-MnO<sup>2</sup> (M = Ni, Co, Cu, Zn, Fe) nanosheets. The typical lamellar morphologies for layered pristine MnO<sup>2</sup> nanosheets were retained after the intercalation of Ni2+ , Co2+, Cu2+, and Zn2+, as shown in Figure 1c-f. In addition, the thickness of the nanosheets after intercalation did not undergo any obvious change. Single nanosheets still remained with thicknesses of ~1.2 nm (see the inset of Figure 1d). Similar restacking of Ni-MnO<sup>2</sup> was also observed from AFM analysis in Figure 1l, m.

SEM energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) was used to confirm the intercalation. Figure 1i shows the SEM-EDX mapping of Ni-MnO2. The intercalated MnO<sup>2</sup> displays a uniform distribution of Mn, O, and Ni elements, indicating the successful exchange between Ni2+ and K<sup>+</sup> (Figure S1). Meanwhile, the atomic concentrations of intercalated metal cations were codetermined by SEM-EDX mapping, XRF, and are listed in Table 1. The contents of the exchanged metal cations were all around 20-30 at%, as determined by XRF, except highly doped Fe (71.4 at%), showing the high accommodation capacity of MnO<sup>2</sup> nanosheets. The resultant proportion of the intercalating transition metal cations are usually related to the intrinsic properties of the cations, like radius, valence, charges, etc. Interestingly, the least exchange amount, 18.3 at%, was obtained after Ni2+ (0.69 Å) intercalation as determined by XRF analysis. As followed, 21.3 at%, 25.1 at%, and 28.8 at% was intercalated as Zn2+ (0.74 Å), Co2+ (0.74 Å), and Cu2+ (0.73 Å) cations were fed. Due to the higher valence and much smaller radius (0.63 Å), Fe3+ resided in the interlayer region in the largest proportion (71.4 at%). The substitution of K<sup>+</sup> with metal ions was also indicated by the evident decrease of K<sup>+</sup> concentration from 8.4 at% (K/Mn) to below 1.0 at% and simultaneous increase of the corresponding metal cation concentration, as summarized in Table 1.

The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface areas calculated by N<sup>2</sup> adsorption-desorption isotherms are summarized in Table 1 and Figure S2. In comparison to pristine MnO<sup>2</sup> (114.2 m<sup>2</sup> g -1 ), intercalated M-MnO<sup>2</sup> exhibited larger surface areas (specially, 280 m<sup>2</sup> g -1 for Ni-MnO2, 165 m<sup>2</sup> g -1 for Co-MnO2, 290 m<sup>2</sup> g -1 for Cu-MnO2, 209 m<sup>2</sup> g -1 for Zn-MnO2, 315 m<sup>2</sup> g -1 for Fe-MnO2). The increase in surface area after intercalation is indicative of the slightly larger accessible active surface that potentially improves electrocatalytic performance as discussed below.

The characteristic crystal structure of pristine MnO<sup>2</sup> nanosheets (JCPDS No. 80-1098, OL-1, Octahedral layered birnessite) was also confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) in Figure 2a.[\[24\]](#page-10-13) The crystal destruction, to some extent, was observed for intercalated M-MnO<sup>2</sup> nanosheets, since the broadening of the diffraction peak (001) was seen in XRD patterns. The intercalation of metal cations including Ni2+, Co2+, Cu2+, and Zn2+ led to a slight shift of (001) and (002) towards a higher 2θ relative to the pristine MnO2, indicating the contraction of the interlayer spacing.[\[16a-c,](#page-10-5) [25\]](#page-10-14) The *d*-spacings presented in Table S1 revealed that the interlayer spacing of MnO<sup>2</sup> decreased from 7.29 Å (pristine MnO2) to 7.24 Å for Ni-MnO2, 7.25 Å for Co-MnO2, 7.18 Å for Cu-MnO<sup>2</sup> and 7.19 Å for Zn-MnO2. The fast diffusion and substitution of K<sup>+</sup> by Ni2+ benefited from the unique layered structure and is illustrated in Figure 2b, demonstrating the visible change of the interlayer spacing. Since the interlayer spacing is sensitive to the guest species, less steric hindrance and enhanced electrostatic attraction are responsible for the shrinkage and contraction of the interlayer spacing after the replacement of K<sup>+</sup> (radius = 1.38 Å) with smaller divalent cations Ni2+ (0.69 Å), Co2+ (0.74 Å), Cu2+ (0.73 Å), and Zn2+ (0.74 Å). As for Fe-MnO2, a high concentration of Fe (71.4 at%) resulted in the disruption of layered nanosheets; while smaller disks were seen in Figure 1h, similar to previous results from Teng *et al.*[\[5\]](#page-9-4) This morphology transformation was also clear from the XRD diffraction (Figure 2a). The amorphous materials were obtained after exchanging with Fe3+. This was mainly attributed to the disruption of the crystal structure of MnO<sup>2</sup> caused by the heavily doped Fe in the crystal lattice as well as the intercalated high-valence cation residing in the interlayer region.

**Electrocatalysis.** The electrocatalytic OER activity of pristine MnO<sup>2</sup> and M-MnO2nanosheets was examined by linear scan voltammetry (LSV) in O2-saturated 1 M KOH using a standard three-electrode configuration. As shown in Figure 3a, Ni-MnO<sup>2</sup> nanosheets were quite active with a considerably low

overpotential (*η* = 330 mV) at a current density of 10 mA cm-2 , which was significantly lower than that of pristine MnO<sup>2</sup> nanosheets (*η* = 581 mV). Amorphous Fe-MnO<sup>2</sup> and low crystalline Co-MnO<sup>2</sup> showed moderate activity towards OER with relatively low overpotentials at 410 and 448 mV, respectively. In contrast, larger overpotentials of 485 and 508 mV were required to attain a current density of 10 mA cm-2 for Cu and Zn intercalated MnO<sup>2</sup> nanosheets, approximately 100 mV lower than that of MnO<sup>2</sup> nanosheets (Figure 3c). The improved OER activity induced by interlayer cation exchange was also suggested by the turnover frequencies (TOF) calculated from LSV measurements at *η* = 450 mV (Table 3). The highest TOF of 0.0356 s-1 was obtained with Ni-MnO2, followed by Fe-MnO<sup>2</sup> (0.0163 s-1 ) and Co-MnO<sup>2</sup> (0.0116 s -1 ), which was significantly higher than that of pristine MnO<sup>2</sup> (0.0061 s-1 ). Moreover, the accompanying Tafel plots further emphasized the superior and fast catalytic kinetics of intercalated MnO<sup>2</sup> nanosheets (Figure 3b). Specifically, the Tafel slope associated with Ni-MnO2, Fe-MnO2, and Co-MnO<sup>2</sup> were all around 22-25 mV dec-1 , much lower than that of pristine MnO<sup>2</sup> nanosheets (47.6 mV dec-1 ), suggesting a lower kinetic barrier for OER after intercalation.

(b) Schematic illustration of the interlayer intercalation and lattice doping of layered MnO<sup>2</sup> nanosheets with Ni2+ cation.

The durability of as-prepared catalysts was evaluated by chronopotentiometry where the current density was maintained at 10 mA cm-2 (Figure 3d). In the case of pure MnO<sup>2</sup> nanosheets, the overpotential increased up to approximately 915 mV in 3.5 h to achieve the target current density at 10 mA cm-2 . This is consistent with the reported poor stability of δ-MnO<sup>2</sup> in water oxidation.[\[6d,](#page-9-10) [16c\]](#page-10-15) Whereas, an evident enhancement in stability occurred after Ni2+ intercalation where the nearly constant applied potential was performed over 3.5 h. The overpotential was maintained at around 390-400 mV even with a slight decrease to obtain 10 mA cm-2 after 3.5 h electrolysis.

On the basis of those findings, the intercalation of metal cations in the interlayer regions of layered MnO2nanosheets is mainly responsible for the improvement of the catalytic activity for OER and stability. The changes in physiochemical properties of intercalated MnO<sup>2</sup> nanosheets, in terms of the average oxidation state of Mn, interlayer distance, electron transfer, and cooperative effects of metal cations/lattice Mn, will be discussed in detail to correlate the structure-function relationship. The activity of Fe-MnO<sup>2</sup> will not be further discussed below due to the morphological transformation and the disruption of the crystallinity of MnO2.

#### **Discussion**

**Average Oxidation State.** Generally, the OER catalyzed by metal oxide in alkaline media undergoes five elementary steps as below, where the reaction (3) is the rate-determining step:

$$M + OH^{-} \rightarrow M - OH + e^{-}$$
 (1)  
 $M - OH + OH^{-} \rightarrow M - O^{-} + H_{2}O$  (2)  
 $M - O + OH^{-} \rightarrow M - OOH + e^{-}$  (3)  
 $M - OOH + OH^{-} \rightarrow M - O_{2} + H_{2}O + e^{-}$  (4)  
 $M - O_{3} \rightarrow M + O_{3}$  (5)

The Mn3+ -rich structured manganese oxides are proven to be more active than other MnOx, since the unstable Mn3+ sites in the MnO<sup>6</sup> octahedra are prone to adsorb the OH- species and form MnOOH intermediates, kinetically accelerating the oxygen evolution. [\[9a,](#page-9-8) [26\]](#page-10-16) Smith *et al.* showed that Mn3+ enriched Mn2O<sup>3</sup> and γ-MnOOH stood out for water oxidation catalysis by comparing various crystalline oxides consisting of Mn3+, Mn4+, and mixedvalence manganese oxides.[\[10a\]](#page-9-9) Additionally, the insertion of Ca or Ag into the tunnel sites of α-MnO<sup>2</sup> (OMS-2) leading to the substantial increase of Mn3+ fraction was reported by Li *et al.*[\[11b\]](#page-10-17) Lucht *et al.* stated that the layer Mn4+ of birnessite would convert to Mn3+ as the cations (*i.e.,* Be, Mg, Zn, B, Al, and Ga) intercalated into the interlayer region.

To uncover the change in surface Mn valence or average oxidation state (AOS) of our intercalated MnO<sup>2</sup> nanosheets, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were collected (Figures 4 and S3). The relative positions of the Mn 2p3/2 and the magnitude of the 2p, 3s multiplet splitting (ΔE 2p and ΔE 3s) extracted from the experimental spectra are summarized in Figures 4a, b and Table 2. For pristine MnO2, the Mn 2p3/2 peak binding energy (BE) of 642.1 eV with a spin energy separation between the Mn 2p1/2 and Mn 2p3/2 of 11.56 eV (ΔE 2p) agrees with the literature value for Mn4+ (Figure 4a, Table 2).[\[27\]](#page-10-18) In Ni-MnO2, the ΔE 2p increased to 11.64 eV for Ni-MnO2, indicating a slight increase of lower oxidation states, *e.g.,* Mn2+ and Mn3+, after intercalation. Nevertheless, there was nearly no change in the multiplet splitting of Mn 3s peak for MnO<sup>2</sup> and Ni-MnO<sup>2</sup> (~4.97 eV, as shown in Figure 4b). This may be ascribed to the surface concentration of Mn species with lower oxidation states being very low. Similar results were also observed for Co-MnO<sup>2</sup> (Figure S4). Moreover, the exchanged metal cations in the intercalated MnO<sup>2</sup> nanosheets were mainly in divalent states (Figure S5). As given in Figure 4d, for Ni-MnO2, two pronounced peaks at 853.9 and 872.0 eV with two shake-up satellites are characteristic for Ni2+ in the Ni 2p region.[\[28\]](#page-10-19) All of the other intercalated metal cations displayed the divalent state, suggesting successful cation exchange without any redox behavior.

The AOS of MnO<sup>2</sup> nanosheets were further measured using a thiosulfate titration method.[\[13\]](#page-10-2) Since the titration measures the oxidation states of Mn after digesting the MnO<sup>2</sup> nanosheets, the AOS values represent the average Mn valence of the bulk. Those results are summarized in Table 1, which gives direct evidence for the decrease in the AOS of all M-MnO2. For example, Ni-MnO<sup>2</sup> exhibits the lowest oxidation state of Mn, 3.81 ± 0.04; while pristine MnO<sup>2</sup> nanosheets have an AOS of 3.85 ± 0.04. The change in the AOS of Mn is very small (0.04), which also does not follow any trend with OER activity of intercalated MnO<sup>2</sup> nanosheets. Therefore, changes in activity are not solely explained by the change in oxidation state of Mn. More characterization of electrochemical properties and vibrational spectra were conducted to explore multiple factors affecting the OER activity and stability.

In addition, the change in the surface O species was measured in the O 1s region (Figure 4c). For pristine MnO2, three distinguishable deconvolution peaks at 529.7, 530.9 and 533.1 eV were attributed to lattice oxygen (O2- ), hydroxyl groups (-OH), and adsorbed water molecules, respectively. While in the case of Ni-MnO2, the proportion of O2 increased from 53.3% for MnO<sup>2</sup> to 63.4% and the adsorption of molecular water became negligible (similarly observed for Co-, Cu-, Zn-MnO2in Table 2). These results suggest that the decreased interlayer spacing is unfavorable for the accommodation and fluctuation of water molecules, known as a key factor to tune the activity of the OER.[\[14\]](#page-10-3)

**Figure 5.** (a) The capacitive current densities at 1.12 V vs RHE as a function of scan rate for MnO2, Ni-MnO2, Co-MnO2, Cu-MnO2, Zn-MnO<sup>2</sup> and Fe-MnO<sup>2</sup> in 1 M KOH solution. (b) Nyquist plots of the prepared materials at an overpotential of 0.47 V.

**Interlayer Spacing, Electrochemical Surface Area (ECSA) and Charge Transfer.** To prove the interlayer-associated OER activity, the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) of prepared catalysts was determined by double layer capacity measurements from 1.07 to 1.17 V vs. RHE in 1 M KOH (Figure S6). Table 3 summarized the obtained double layer capacity (Cdl) for all the catalysts and the Cdl is linearly proportional to ECSA. As depicted in Figure 5a, the relative enhancement was observed in the intercalated MnO<sup>2</sup> compared to pristine MnO<sup>2</sup> (6.1 mF cm-2 ), but the most active Ni-MnO<sup>2</sup> possessed a moderate surface area of 15.8 mF cm-2 and Co-MnO<sup>2</sup> even showed the highest surface area of 33.9 mF cm-2 among all the catalysts. This result suggests that the improvement of the OER activity is unlikely related to exposed surface area; instead, the OER should occur in the interlayer regions where the intercalated cations resided.

Furthermore, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) studies were conducted at an overpotential of 0.47 V in 1 M KOH to evaluate the catalytic kinetics of the prepared materials. The equivalent circuit curves fit very well with the Nyquist plots in Figure 5b and the charge transfer resistance (Rct) and the rate constant (k<sup>0</sup> ) are listed in Table 3. Not surprisingly, the Ni-MnO<sup>2</sup> exhibited the lowest transport impedance and the charge transfer resistance of 52.0 Ω, followed by Co-MnO<sup>2</sup> (67.1 Ω). In contrast, the Rct values of Cu-MnO<sup>2</sup> and Zn-MnO<sup>2</sup> are two orders of magnitude larger, close to that of pristine MnO<sup>2</sup> (3325 Ω). These fitting results indicate the accelerated charge transfer and fast catalytic kinetics between layers are ascribed to the reduced steric hindrance and decreased interlayer distance after Ni and Co intercalation. Hence, the modification of interlayer environments mainly contributes to the improved OER activity, consistent with the literature.[\[14,](#page-10-3) [29\]](#page-10-20)

**Vibrational characterization.** How the intercalated cations affect the interlayer environment or the cooperative effect across the interlayer of MnO<sup>2</sup> is still ambiguous. Vibrational spectroscopic technologies including Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and Raman spectroscopic are particularly attractive, due to their high sensitivity to the local structures of manganese oxide materials. FTIR and Raman spectroscopy can offer more comprehensive and reliable evaluation of structural properties. The similarity in FTIR spectra gave supportive evidence for retaining of the crystal structure of MnO<sup>2</sup> nanosheets for all samples. Especially in the range of lower wavenumbers (< 700 cm-1 ), characteristic bands at 535, 492 and 446 cm−1 are assigned to Mn-O stretching modes in MnO<sup>6</sup> octahedra layers in MnO2(Figure 6a).[\[30\]](#page-10-21) The broad band at around 3220 cm−1 and peaks located at 1624 and 1420 cm-1 are attributed to the symmetric stretching vibrations and O-H bending vibration of hydroxyl groups, respectively.[\[31\]](#page-10-22)

**Figure 6.** (a) FT-IR spectra and (b) Raman spectra of the pristine MnO2, Ni-MnO2, Co-MnO2, Cu-MnO2, Zn-MnO2, and Fe-MnO<sup>2</sup> nanosheets.

More detailed vibrational spectroscopic data were further collected by using Raman spectroscopy (Figure 6b). For pristine MnO2, the two pronounced high-wavenumber bands along with two rather low intense bands < 500 cm-1 are consistent with the reports for δ-MnO2. [\[32\]](#page-10-23) As determined from Raman simulations, Raman-active modes with 3A<sup>g</sup> + 6 B<sup>g</sup> species are usually shown in MnO<sup>2</sup> materials (*i.e.,* birnessite structured δ-MnO2) with monoclinic C2/m space group. Accordingly, the most prominent Raman bands for pristine MnO<sup>2</sup> at 653 cm-1 were due to the outof-plane *v*1(Mn-O) symmetric stretching vibrations along the interlayer direction in the MnO<sup>2</sup> framework, which is assigned to A1g symmetric mode in the spectroscopic space group.[\[33\]](#page-10-24) The band at 576 cm-1 is a specific fingerprint of in-plane stretching vibrations *v*2(Mn-O) of MnO6groups along the layer chains. Intercalated M-MnO<sup>2</sup> all preserved the inherent spectral features of the δ-MnO2nanosheets with distinguishable *v*1and *v*<sup>2</sup> modes. The weakening and broadening of the *v*<sup>1</sup> and *v*2modes revealed an increased degree of structural disorder for M-MnO2, which is ascribed to a strong Jahn-Teller effect induced by the intercalation of cations in the interlayer region.[\[34\]](#page-10-25) This is in good agreement with the XRD results (Figure 2a). An obvious blue shift of the *v*<sup>1</sup> stretching frequency to higher wavenumber 664 cm-1 was observed after Ni intercalation, indicative of the strengthening of the Mn-O bonds perpendicularly to the layer chains. The elongation of the MnO<sup>6</sup> octahedra along the interlayer direction is attributed to the enhanced interaction between the basal Mn and intercalated metal cations. The incorporation of metal cations into the interlayer spacing caused local lattice distortion where the increase of the *v*<sup>1</sup> vibrational mode occurred. In addition, the increased intensity ratio of *v*2/*v*<sup>1</sup> vibrational modes implied enhanced polarizability, which directly resulted from the replacement of K<sup>+</sup> with more positive transition metal cations.[\[35\]](#page-10-26) Thus, the readily intercalated transition metal cations result in the enhancement of the OER activity by varying the interlayer environment and interactions between layers.

**Figure 7.** (a) XRD patterns and (b) Raman spectra for MnO2, Ni-MnO2, Nidoped MnO2, and Ni-doped MnO2/K<sup>+</sup> respectively.

**Comparison between in-plane doping and interlayer intercalation.** The interlayer-associated OER activity enhancement was further confirmed by control experiments of the in-plane doping of Ni into MnO<sup>2</sup> nanosheets. The in-plane Nidoped MnO<sup>2</sup> was obtained by synthesizing MnO<sup>2</sup> in the presence of Ni(NO3)2, denoted as Ni-doped MnO2. As shown in Figure 7a, the XRD diffraction peaks corresponding to (001) and (002) planes of Ni-doped MnO<sup>2</sup> also shifted to higher values with peak broadening, similar to the intercalated Ni-MnO2. The reductions in the interlayer distance and crystallinity were ascribed to the substitution of Mn by Ni in the planes.[\[36\]](#page-10-27) The Raman vibrations of Ni-doped MnO<sup>2</sup> resembled that of Ni-MnO2, where a 12 cm-1 shift to high-wavenumber for *v*<sup>1</sup> mode was also observed (Figure 7b). This shift to a higher vibration frequency, again, indicated the strengthening of the Mn-O bonds along the interlayer direction in the Ni-doped MnO2. Therefore, the effective partial replacement of Mn by smaller Ni mainly accounts for the stronger network energy of the Ni-doped materials. As a control, we used excessive K + to exchange or extract the doped Ni ions. Consequently, no discernible changes in XRD and Raman spectra were found for Ni-doped MnO2/K<sup>+</sup> (K<sup>+</sup> intercalation after in-plane Ni-doping), showing the difficulty in replacing Ni embedded in the in-plane layers via simple ion exchange.

**Figure 8.** (a) Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves of OER for pristine MnO2, Ni- MnO2, Ni-doped MnO2, and Ni-doped MnO2/K<sup>+</sup> nanosheets in O2-saturated 1 M KOH at a scan rate of 10 mV s-1 . (b) Comparison of overpotentials to reach 10 mA cm-2 for MnO2, Ni-doped MnO<sup>2</sup> and Ni-doped MnO2/K<sup>+</sup>nanosheets.

Considering similar trends of varying properties, we compared the electrocatalytic activity of Ni-doped MnO<sup>2</sup> and Ni-MnO<sup>2</sup> nanosheets as shown in Figure 8. The overpotential at 10 mA cm-2 is 426 mV, 155 mV lower as compared to pristine MnO2. This demonstrates the enhancement in OER activity resulting

from cooperative effects between Mn and neighbor doped Ni.[\[37\]](#page-10-28) Ni-doped MnO<sup>2</sup> is still less active than that of Ni-MnO<sup>2</sup> (*η* = 330 mV at 10 mA cm-2 ).

The difference in the OER activity of intercalated and inplane doped MnO<sup>2</sup> nanosheets clearly shows that the mobility of Ni ions is critical to the different interlayer environments. As verified by the afore-mentioned results, the OER catalysis is prone to occur in the interlayer regions where mobile cations serve as the active sites. The modifications and interactions between the layers are essential to the OER catalysis. Based on our experimental findings, the intercalated Ni2+ ions likely influence the cooperative binding of water or oxo during O<sup>2</sup> generation. In small-molecule Mn complexes, the formation of Mn3+/4+ -(*μ*-O)-Mn3+/4+ is often observed as a key intermediate for catalytic O–O bond formation.[\[38\]](#page-10-29) Hence, the function of Ni incorporation can be twofold, i) distorting the di-*μ*-oxo bridge between Mn and a fraction of weak metal-oxo bridges formed instead of easily eliminating O2; and ii) dynamically moving between layers to allow a change in Mn distances between the two layers.[\[39\]](#page-10-30) The interlayer cooperative effect accordingly facilitates the elongation or breaking of the Mn-O bond, eventually promoting O<sup>2</sup> generation. In the case of Ni-doped MnO<sup>2</sup> where substituted Ni2+ ions were trapped in the lattice, a local distortion of MnO<sup>6</sup> octahedra was also observed. The restricted local Mn-O species have limited reactivity due to the lack of mobility of Ni2+ . More dynamic interlayer sites with intercalated Ni2+ ions are of great importance in reducing the energy barrier of O-O bond formation.[\[40\]](#page-10-31) In addition, the cooperative effect between Mn and the intercalated cations (Ni2+ ions) that are known to form di-*μ*-oxo bridges themselves,[\[41\]](#page-10-32) can not be ruled out with our current results, since other cations (Cu2+ and Zn2+) do not significantly promote oxygen evolution.

#### **Conclusions**

In summary, we investigated the effect of intercalated transistion metal cations into the interlayer region of octahedral layered (OL-1) MnO<sup>2</sup> nanosheets, including Ni2+, Co2+, Cu2+, Zn2+ , and Fe3+ ions. The intercalation of Ni2+ ions showed a remarkable enhancement of OER activity and long-term stability with the lowest overpotential of 330 mV to achieve the current density of 10 mA cm-2 and highest TOF of 0.0356 s-1 in comparison to pristine MnO2nanosheets (*η* = 581 mV, TOF = 0.0061 s-1 ) and among other intercalated MnO<sup>2</sup> nanosheets. Detailed structural analysis and electrochemical characterization were used to study the likely mechanisms that contributed to the improvement of OER activity. The modification of interlayer environments mainly contributes to the improved OER activity other than changes on the surface of MnO<sup>2</sup> nanosheets. Ni intercalation, different from other metal cations, strengthens the Mn-O bond perpendicular to the layer chains to further facilitate the interlayer catalysis possibly between two Mn sites. Compared to the trapped Ni2+ ions in the case of Ni-doped MnO2, more dynamic Ni2+ ions intercalated between layers are benefical to O-O bond formation across the entire layer, thus promoting the OER. The demonstrated intercalation effect highlights a facile and effcient strategy applicable to other layered materials and provides new opportunities to develop highly efficient OER catalysts.

**Materials** Potassium permanganate (KMnO4, ≥99.0%), sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS, ≥99.0%), concentrated sulfuric acid (H2SO4, 95.0-98.0%), cobalt(II) nitrate hexahydrate (Co(NO3)2·6H2O, ≥98%), copper(II) nitrate trihydrate (Cu(NO3)2·3H2O, 99-104%), nickel(II) nitrate trihydrate (Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, 98%), iron(III) nitrate nonahydrate (Fe(NO3)3·9H2O, ≥98%), zinc(II) nitrate hexahydrate (Zn(NO3)2·6H2O, 98%), ethanol, Vulcan XC 72R carbon black, Nafion perfluorinated resin solution (5 wt% in lower aliphatic alcohols and water, contains 15-20% water ) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received. Deionized water (High-Q, Inc. 103S Stills) with a resistivity of >10.0 MΩ was used throughout the experiments.

**Synthesis of MnO<sup>2</sup> nanosheets** MnO<sup>2</sup> nanosheets were synthesized using a previously reported procedure*.* [\[19\]](#page-10-8) 0.92 g (3.2 mol) of SDS was first dissolved in 315 mL distilled water containing 1.6 mL of 0.1 M H2SO4. The mixture was refluxed for 10 min. Then, 3.2 mL of 50 mM KMnO<sup>4</sup> (25.3 mg) aqueous solution was added to the above solution under vigorous stirring. The reaction was further refluxed for 1 h. The MnO<sup>2</sup> nanosheets were collected by centrifugation and washed with distilled water for three times. The purified MnO<sup>2</sup> nanosheets were redispersed and stored in water (1 mg mL-1 ) for further characterization and synthesis.

**Synthesis of intercalated M-MnO<sup>2</sup> (M = Ni, Co, Cu, Zn, Fe) nanosheets**  Cation intercalated MnO<sup>2</sup> (denoted as M-MnO2, M = Ni, Co, Cu, Zn, Fe) nanosheets were synthesized by a simple cation exchange method. 10 mL of the as-prepared MnO<sup>2</sup> nanosheets colloidal solution (1 mg mL-1 ) was diluted in 90 mL distilled water. The solution with multivalent cationic nitrate salts (the molar ratio of M: Mn = 3:1) was added and the suspended MnO<sup>2</sup> flocculated immediately. The mixture was stirred for overnight at room temperature, collected by centrifugation and washed with water for three times to remove the free nitrate salts. The purified M-MnO<sup>2</sup> was redispersed in water for further electrochemical characterization.

**Synthesis of Ni-doped MnO<sup>2</sup> nanosheets** Ni-doped MnO<sup>2</sup> nanosheets were synthesized similar to the procedure of pristine MnO<sup>2</sup> nanosheets except the introduction of the Ni salt. 315 mL of aqueous solution containing 0.92 g (3.2 mol) SDS and 1.6 mL of H2SO<sup>4</sup> (0.1 M) was refluxed for 10 min. Then, 3.2 mL of 50 mM KMnO4and 5 mM Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (the molar ratio of Ni: Mn= 0.1:1) was rapidly added under vigorous stirring. The reaction was further refluxed for 1 h. The obtained suspension was centrifuged and washed with distilled water for three times, then redispersed in water (1 mg mL-1 ) and kept for further characterization.

**Titration by thiosulfate to determine the average oxidation state (AOS) of Mn** The AOS of Mn in each intercalated sample was determined by titration with sodium thiosulfate.[\[13\]](#page-10-2) Typically, 10 mg of various nanosheets were first dissolved in 1 mL of NaOH/NaI solution (3.2 g of NaOH, 6 g of NaI, and 10 mL of water) and 2 mL of 20 vol% sulfuric acid solution. After the complete dissolution of the powder, the red solution was titrated with 5 mM sodium thiosulfate solution until the color turned to pale yellow. After adding 4 mL of starch indicator solution (2 mg mL-1 ), more thiosulfate solution was dropped until the blue color disappeared and the solution became colorless. The consumed volume of thiosulfate was recorded to determine the AOS of Mn:

$$AOS = 2\left[1 + \frac{1}{2} \frac{n(OX)}{n(Mn)}\right] \tag{6}$$

where, *n*(Ox) is the mole of oxidized equivalents (thiosulfate), *n*(Mn) is the mole of Mn. Three measurements were carried out for each sample to calculate the standard derivation.

**Characterizations** Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed with a FEI Tecnai 12 G2 Spirit Bio TWIN with an accelerating voltage of 120 kV. TEM samples were prepared by casting the suspension of materials on a carbon coated copper grid (400 mesh). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was carried out using a FEI Nova NanoSEM 450, equipped with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) microanalysis. An accelerating voltage of 10 kV and a beam current of 10 mA was applied. SEM samples were prepared by casting a suspension of the materials on silicon wafers. The wide-angle X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns over a 2θ range of 5-80° with a continuous scan rate of 0.25°/min were recorded using a Bruker D2 Phaser powder diffractometer (Cu Kα radiation, λ = 1.5406 Å) with an operating voltage of 40 kV and a current of 44 mA. The quantitative elemental compositions of samples were determined by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) with a Rigaku ZSX Primus IV sequential wavelengthdispersive XRF spectrometer (4 kW Rh anode). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis of the synthesized materials was conducted on a PHI model Quantum 2000 spectrometer with scanning ESCA multiprobe (ɸ Physical Electronics Industries Inc.) using Al Kα radiation (λ = 1486.6 eV) as the radiation source. The spectra were recorded in the fixed analyzer transmission mode with pass energies of 187.85 eV and 29.35 eV for recording survey and high resolution spectra, respectively. Binding energies (BE) were measured for Cu 2p, Co 2p, Ni 2p, Fe 2p, Zn 2p, Mn 2p, Mn 3s, and O 1s regions. The XPS spectra were analyzed and fitted using CasaXPS software (version 2.3.16). Sample charging effects were eliminated by correcting the observed spectra with the C 1s BE value of 284.8 eV. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was conducted with a Nanosurf NaioAFM spectrometer under tapping mode at room temperature in air. AFM samples were prepared by casting on a graphite substrate. Raman spectra were obtained on a Renishaw 2000 Raman scope with 50× microscope objective and an Ar ion laser (514.4 nm) as the excitation source. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was performed on a NICOLET MAGNA 560 FTIR spectrometer in transmission mode (32 scans, 4 cm-1 resolution). The surface area of as-synthesized materials was evaluated by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method on a Nova 2000e apparatus. The samples were degassed for 6 h before nitrogen adsorption measurements and the specific surface area was calculated using the BET equation.

**Electrochemical measurements** All electrochemical measurements were performed using a standard three-electrode cell with a CHI 627E electrochemical potentiostat. The Ag/AgCl electrode (saturated with KCl, EAg/AgCl = 0.197 V, at 25 ˚C) and platinum wire was employed as the reference electrode and counter electrode, respectively. A piece of carbon paper (1 cm ×1 cm) casted by catalyst ink was adopted as the working electrode. The aqueous dispersion of purified catalysts without drying (500 µL, 8 mg mL-1 ) was directly mixed with 500 µL of Vulcan XC-72R carbon suspension (2 mg mL-1 in ethanol) by sonication avoiding the aggregation of nanosheets. Then 92 µL of 5 wt% Nafion solution was added and sonicated for another 20 mins. About 50 µL of the catalyst ink was dropcasted on the carbon paper and dried overnight before use. All potentials presented in this work are calibrated to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) using the Nernst equation: ERHE = EAg/AgCl + 0.059×pH + 0.197. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was *i*R-compensated and recorded at a scan rate of 10 mV s-1 over the range of 1.0 to 1.8 V (vs RHE) in O2 saturated 1 M KOH solution. Non-faradaic double layer capacity measurements were conducted from 1.03 to 1.13 V in 1 M KOH with different sweeping rates between 4 and 20 mV s-1 . The electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were examined in the sweeping frequency from 100 to 0.01 kHz with an ac voltage of 5 mV amplitude. The applied potential was 1.7 V (vs RHE). The turnover frequency (TOF) value of OER is calculated with the equation below:

$$TOF = \frac{jA}{AEn} \tag{7}$$

where, *j* is the current density (mA cm−2 ) obtained at *η* = 0.45 V from LSV measurements, *A* is the geometric area of the working electrode, *F* is the Faraday constant (96500 C mol−1 ) and *n* is the number of moles of the catalyst.

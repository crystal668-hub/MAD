Developing nonprecious metallic electrocatalysts for water splitting is of vital importance for sustainable environment and energy technologies. As for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), FeCo-based bimetallic catalysts have been found to act as promising candidates owing to their high intrinsic activity. Herein, a novel FeCo-oxalate organic framework was grown on nickel foam (FeCo-OA@NF) under mild conditions. The optimized electrocatalyst shows good OER performance with a low overpotential of 275 mV at the current density of 100 mAcm <sup>2</sup> in alkaline environment, comparable to that of commercial Ru-

based catalyst. Moreover, the quantification of produced oxygen by both gas chromatography and drainage method demonstrates nearly 100% Faradaic efficiency. Except for the contribution of Fe and Co species for the excellent OER catalytic activity, in-situ Raman spectroscopy reveals that the positive effect of oxalate coordination also makes a difference, which can possibly reduce electron transport resistance and provide more active sites. This work provides a promising approach for the preparation of alkaline oxygen evolution electrocatalysts with low-cost and high performance.

### **Introduction**

In recent decades, the soaring energy consumption and deteriorating environmental problems have aroused continuous public concerns. Hence, to explore renewable energy resource and alternative storage techniques is of great urgency to cope with the current dilemma.[1–3] Among the several proposed routes, water splitting is considered as one of the most promising approaches to generate hydrogen, which is a carbon-free and renewable energy source.[4–6] The anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is considered as a key role in water splitting, because OER requires large overpotential resulting from its complicated four-electron transfer process, thus the overall efficiency of energy conversion is inevitably restrained.[7–8]

To overcome these obstacles, OER electrocatalysts with high efficiency (such as low overpotential, high Faradic efficiency) are extremely desirable. Although Ir/Ru based oxides remain the benchmark of OER electrocatalysts, their high costs severely hinder their widespread applications, further prompting people to search for earth-abundant and cost-effective non-noble metal based OER catalysts. In particular, transitional metals (such as Fe, Co, Ni) based electrocatalysts with unique electronic structures have been investigated owing to their suitable chemical bond strength with catalytic reaction intermediates.[9–10] In addition, the introduction of organic ligands with specific functional groups,[11–13] especially those containing carboxyl functional groups with high negative charge density, is also a classical strategy to improve catalytic performance toward water electrolysis (for example, oxalate that has two -COO functional groups can tailor the adsorptiondissociation performance of the metal surface to optimize catalytic behavior).[14,15] However, research on oxalate-based organic framework of multi-metals is still limited.

Inspired by the above ideas, we report one pot synthesis of FeCo-oxalate framework supported on nickel foam (FeCo-OA@NF) under mild conditions. The as-synthesized self-supported electrocatalyst shows remarkable enhanced OER activity in alkaline media than mono-metal oxalate or oxalate-free counterparts, with the overpotential (η) of 275 mV at 100 mAcm <sup>2</sup> , comparable with that of the noble Ru-based catalyst. Combined with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and other characterization results, the oxalate-promoting mechanism was proposed. In-situ Raman spectroscopy demonstrates that the decaying current density during i-t test can be ascribed to the decrease of oxalate concentration on the electrode. Moreover, the amount of O2 evolved from OER was quantified and the result shows approximately 100% Faradic efficiency, indicating that FeCo-OA@NF is competent for highly promising OER catalysts. This work provides new insights into fabricating novel nonprecious OER catalysts with multi-metal sites and carboxyl coordination.

## **Results and Discussion**

### **Synthesis and Structural Characterizations of Catalysts**

The fabrication process of FeCo-OA@NF is shown in Scheme 1, where Co(NO3)2 and Fe(NO3)3 are employed as metal precursors, and (NH4)2C2O4 is employed as ligand agent.[16] In this process, the NF underwent an obvious color change, indicating the spontaneous precipitation growth of metal organic framework.[17] For comparison, Fe-OA@NF, Co-OA@NF and FeCo@NF were prepared under similar conditions without Co(NO3)2, Fe(NO3)3 and (NH4)2C2O4, respectively (See Experimental Section for details). The microstructure was explored by scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM) (Figure 1). Figure 1a shows a full coverage of FeCo-OA nanoflower on the nickel foam. TEM image shows that the as-prepared catalyst presents ultrathin and almost transparent sheet-like morphology.As shown in Figure 1c, the corresponding EDX elemental mapping images indicate the uniform distribution of Co, Fe, C and O elements in the FeCo-OA. The XRD pattern of FeCo-OA@NF (Figure S1) was also collected. There are two prominent and sharp diffraction peaks at 44.5° and 51.8°, corresponding to the (111) and (200) crystal faces of Ni (JCPDS: 04-0850), which are derived from the Ni foam.[18] The Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrum (Figure S2) displays the functional groups of FeCo-OA@NF. Two powerful absorption bands at 1357 and 1590 cm <sup>1</sup> are associated with the characteristic antisymmetric and symmetric O C=O stretching frequency vibrations, respectively, confirming the existence of oxalate.[19]

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) can analyze the chemical composition of the catalyst surface, which confirms the existence of four elements, namely, Co, Fe, C and O. In Figure 2a, twin peaks at the binding energy positions of about 780.7 eV and 796.6 eV are ascribed to Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2 respectively, implying the existence of Co2<sup>+</sup> state.[20] Two peaks shown in Figure 2b are located near 712.4 and 724.9 eV, corresponding to high resolution Fe 2p spectrum, which are consistent with the characteristic peaks of Fe<sup>3</sup><sup>+</sup>. [21] Figure 2c demonstrates the coordination of the oxalate. The XPS spectrum of C 1s shows three peaks, their binding energy values are 288.9 eV, 286.2 eV and 284.8 eV, corresponding to three types of carbon, namely, C C, O C=O and C O, respectively. For the high-resolution spectrum of O 1s shown in Figure 2d, the existence of Metal-O bonds and the coordination between the group of OA linkers and adsorbed water are all confirmed, as their characteristic peaks are captured at the binding energy of 530.6 eV, 531.8 eV and 532.4 eV.[22] All the above observations suggest that Fe, Co and OA species have been introduced on the surface of nickel foam.

#### **Electrocatalytic OER Activity**

Electrochemical measurements were performed in a standard three-electrode system with the FeCo-OA@NF electrode in an H-type cell. For comparison, bare NF, Fe-OA@NF, Co-OA@NF and FeCo@NF were also tested. First, linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was conducted to test the electrochemical behavior of these electrodes in 1.0 M KOH (with iR compensation), as shown in Figure 3a. The peak at 1.4–1.5 V of Co-OA@NF (black line) is possibly related to the oxidation of Co2<sup>+</sup> to Co3<sup>+</sup>. [23] As for the curve of FeCo-OA@NF electrode (Figure 3b), a high catalytic current density of 100 mAcm <sup>2</sup> for the OER is obtained at the oxidation potential of 1.5 V vs RHE, and the corresponding overpotential is 275 mV, comparable to that of RuO2 catalysts and other similar OER catalysts(Table S1). This result demonstrates that the FeCo-OA@NF electrode is a highly efficient water-oxidation catalyst. In contrast, the bare NF electrode displays poor electrochemical performance, the OER does not proceed until the oxidation potential rises to 1.6 V versus RHE (purple line).

Kinetics of the as-prepared FeCo-OA@NF was evaluated utilizing the Tafel plots (Figure 3c). The electrode displays a significant efficiency and an unprecedentedly low Tafel slope of 41.5 mVdec <sup>1</sup> . The possible reasons for which are as follows:[24] 1) The NF possesses relatively high electrical conductivity, which can promote rapid electron transfer in the catalytic process. 2) The highly efficient deposited FeCo-OA catalyst on the substrate significantly improves the activity in the OER. Figure 3d shows the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) yielded Nyquist plots of FeCo-OA@NF and other control samples. Clearly, the semi-circle radius of the bimetal-based material is significantly reduced (red plots), indicating excellent charge-transfer capability relative to the single-metal or oxalate-free materials. The active surface area is a very important factor for catalysts in the OER, and it is well known that an increase in the active surface area often leads to an enhancement of the catalytic activity.[25] Therefore, the electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) was estimated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) on the basis of the double-layer capacitance (Cdl) of the materials, as shown in Figure 3e and 3f. The higher

Cdl of FeCo-OA@NF demonstrates its much larger electrochemical active area and more active sites.[26]

Faradaic efficiency (FE) measurements were performed at a fixed current density of ~100 mAcm <sup>2</sup> to check whether the obtained current are derived from the OER. After electrolysis for 1 h, there is an approximate agreement of the measured value and theoretical value of the produced O2 (Figure 4), suggesting nearly 100% FE for oxygen evolution on the FeCo-OA@NF electrode and no side reactions occur during the electrolysis period. Moreover, oxygen determined by gas chromatography (GC) also displays a steady FE of more than 97% (see Table S2). We further tested the durability of the electrode in OER. There is an about 13% current density decay after a continuous performance at a relatively high current density (Figure S3). We noticed that the oxalate coordination concentration might play an important role in catalytic activity. The decrease of oxalate concentration on the electrode was proved by FT-IR, XRD and XPS spectra. The signal of oxalate is strongly weakened (Figure S4). Based on this, it is believed that the oxalate loss in the catalysts results in the declined catalytic performance.

In-situ Raman spectroscopy was applied to figure out the composition evolution of the catalyst during OER process. Measurements were carried out at the potential of 1.55 V vs. RHE. As depicted by the Raman spectra in Figure 5, when the potential is set on, the Raman spectra change significantly with new bands appearing at ~460 and 550 cm <sup>1</sup> , which are

associated with the intermediate M OOH.[19,27] Moreover, the intensity of the characteristic bands belonging to M OOH becomes higher as the reaction proceeds. This suggests that metal (Fe and Co) sites serve as active sites during the OER process. The intensity of Raman bands at 910 and 1470 cm <sup>1</sup> are attributed to the stretching modes of metal oxalates.[20] They vanish gradually and similar intensity change is also observed on single-metal electrodes (Figure S5a). Notably, compared with the spectra of oxalate-free electrode (Figure S5c), the much stronger signal of M OOH on FeCo-OA@NF indicates that oxalate coordination benefits the OER, which can be related to the reduced electron transport resistance (Figure 3d) and the increased active sites (Figure 3f). Moreover, oxalates serve as versatile chelating agent, which help stabilize the metal centers with high valence sate.[28] These results also agree well with the aforementioned observations of oxalate loss resulting in activity decay, further demonstrating the important role of oxalate coordination for the improvement of the OER performance. The possible OER processes in alkaline media is proposed, where \* represents the active site of catalyst surface: In the first step, hydroxide ion is adsorbed to produce the \*OH intermediate. Then, the \*O is produced, accompanied by water molecule generation. \*O reacts with another hydroxide ion and M\*OOH intermediate is formed on catalyst surface. Finally, M\*OOH is oxidized to evolve O2 by one electron transfer process and the original active site is recovered.[29]

## **Conclusions**

In summary, based on a low-cost, highly conductive, and porous nickel foam (NF), we have prepared a binary metal organic framework as highly efficient electrode for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) by a simple oxalate coordination method. The electrode exhibits a current density of 100 mAcm <sup>2</sup> at a rather low overpotential of 275 mV, comparable to that of RuO2 catalysts. And it also displays a low Tafel slope of 41.5 mVdec <sup>1</sup> . Moreover, the FeCo-OA@NF electrode can maintain approximately 100% Faradic efficiency during alkaline OER process. The remarkable OER performance is ascribed to bimetallic composition as well as oxalate coordination of the electrode. However, the oxalate loss results in apparent decrease in activity. Further improvement of its stability is desired. Even so, the high activity makes the FeCo-OA@NF electrode promising candidate for OER. This work offers a facile approach towards the fabrication of OER electrode with satisfying performances, and also inspires the understanding towards the oxalate-assisted OER process.

## **Experimental Section**

**Chemicals**. Cobaltous nitrate hexahydrate (Co(NO3)2 ·6H2O, �98%), Ferric nitrate nonahydrate (Fe(NO3)3 ·9H2O, �98%) were bought from sigma. Ammonium oxalate ((NH4)2C2O4, AR) was obtained from Sinopharm. Nickel foam (thickness: 1.5 mm) was purchased from ANSU in Kun shan, Jiang Su province. Double distilled water was used for all protocols.

**Synthesis of FeCo-OA@NF**. 0.1 mmol of Co(NO3)2 and 0.1 mmol of Fe(NO3)3 were dissolved with 6 mL of water in a vial, followed by the immersion of nickel foam (1\*2 cm). Then the mixture was stirred for 1 h at room temperature. Afterwards, the ammonium oxalate addition protocol was conducted (0.2 mmol), and the mixture underwent a continual stirring for 2 h under 60°C. The manufactured nickel foam was then washed with water and dried in vacuum at 60 °C overnight. Fe-OA@NF, Co-OA@NF and FeCo@NF were prepared under similar procedure, except a certain precursor is omitted.

**Electrochemical measurements**. The electrochemical measurements used a H-type three-electrode cell with CHI 760E electrochemical workstation (CH Instruments, Instrument Corporation, China). NF electrode, Ag/AgCl electrode (saturated KCl) and Pt wire were used as working, reference, and counter electrode, respectively. All potentials given were converted to reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) using equation below: ERHE=EAg/AgCl+0.197 V+ 0.826 V for pH=14 at 25°C. The Faradaic efficiency of O2 generation was calculated by FE=4nF/Q (n, F, and Q refer to the amount of product, the Faraday constant and the total charge consumed, respectively).

> **Abstract.** The strong binding energy of Pt with oxygen intermediates results in its low OER efficiency at the anode. Herein, Pt-doped CoFeP (Pt-CoFeP) material has been synthesized using CoFe-PBA as precursor through facile etching and phosphating processes. Interestingly, Pt-CoFeP with hollow cage framework exhibits large surface area after etching, which plays a domain-limiting role for the high dispersion of platinum atoms and facilitates the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The target sample Pt-CoFeP only needs low overpotentials of 311.7 and 343.1 mV to deliver the current density of 10 and 50 mA cm-2, which is superior to commercial RuO2. The excellent activity can be attributed to large specific surface area in hollow framework and highly dispersed platinum atoms. And its great durability is evaluated through chronoamperometry measurement for 12 hours. This work provides a potential method to design electrocatalysts with complex structure loaded with highly dispersed Pt particles derived from Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) for water splitting.

**Keywords:** Prussian blue analogues, Phosphating, Platinum dispersion, oxygen evolution reaction.

## **1. Introduction**

The practical application of renewable energy conversion is hindered by the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) [1]. Therefore, the design of low-cost and high activity OER catalysts is one of the key determinants to realize efficient energy conversion through water electrolysis [2]. Over the past decade, significant progress has been made in the exploration of novel OER electro-catalyst as replacements for expensive IrO2 and RuO2. For instance, lots of transition metal phosphides (TMPs) have attracted much attention from researchers, due to their good electrochemical stability. Chen et al. established that the utilization of nitrogendoped graphene as a substrate for CoP nanosheet growth (CoP@NG) resulted in a lower overpotential of 354 mV at 10 mA cm-2 for OER, which is lower than that of bare CoP (395 mV) [3]. However, there is still potential for improvement in catalytic performance of CoP.

As a subclass of metal organic frameworks (MOFs), Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) possess bimetal centers, which offer a potential avenue for the formation of bimetallic phosphides. Moreover, the ordered structure of PBAs provides a possibility for designing complex and confined functional structures. For example, Xu et al. synthesized NiFeP using NiFe PBA as the precursor, which exhibited excellent oxygen evolution performance [4].

Inspired by the above considerations, we synthesized CoFeP with uniformly dispersed platinum atoms by using a CoFe PBA as the precursor and employing a combination of chemical etching and gas-phase phosphidation methods. The obtained CoFeP dopped with Pt (Pt-CoFeP) shows outstanding oxygen evolution activity, which may be enhanced by the hollow cage framework exposed numerous active site, as well as the optimized electron density between Co/Fe and Pt. Relative electrochemical experiments have been explored. Pt-CoFeP only needs a low overpotential of 311.7 mV to achieve the current density of 10 mA cm-2, which is superior to commercial RuO2.

## **2. Experimental Procedures**

#### **2.1 Materials Preparation**

Chemicals: Potassium ferricyanide (K3[Fe(CN)6], ≥ 99%), Cobalt (II) chloride hexahydrate (CoCl2ꞏ6H2O, ≥ 99%), Trisodium citrate dihydrate (C6H5Na3O7ꞏ2H2O), Chloroplatinic acid hexahydrate (H2PtCl6ꞏ6H2O), Lascorbic acid (C6H8O6), Potassium hydroxide (KOH) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd..

Preparation of e-CoFe PBA: In a typic synthesis process, mixed solutions containing 60 mL of 1.2 mmol K3[Fe(CN)6] in aqueous solution (Solution A) and 60 mL of 1.8 mmol CoCl2ꞏ6H2O and 2.7 mmol Na3C6H5O7ꞏ2H2O in aqueous solution (Solution B) were stirred vigorously and aged at 25 ° C for 24 h. The resulting CoFe PBA was collected via centrifugation, washed with deionized water, and dried at 60 °C. Then, e-CoFe PBA was obtained by etching in 1.0 M KOH solution.

Preparation of Pt-CoFeP: The e-CoFe PBA was mixed with 0.6 mL chloroplatinic acid and 1.2 mL L-ascorbic acid in 10 mL deionized water. After 4 h in an oven at 80 ° C, Pt-CoFe PBA was obtained by centrifugation. After phosphating at 350 °C for 2 h, the final catalyst Pt-CoFeP was successfully synthesized.

#### **2.2 Physical Characterization**

The morphologies of all samples were characterized via SEM (FEI QuantaFEG 450, 20 kV). TEM was performed on Hitachi HT7700 system. Crystal structures were analyzed by XRD (Bruker D8) with a scanning rate of 5° /min. The valence states of elements were analyzed by XPS (ESCALAB 250Xi) which carried out on the spectrometer with an Cu Kα X-ray source.

#### **2.3 Electrochemical measurements**

Electrochemical measurements were performed on a Gamry Reference 3000 electrochemical workstation with a three-electrode system. The working, counter and reference electrode are the target catalysts, a platinum sheet and Hg/HgO electrode, repectively. The polarization curves were performed in 1 M KOH electrolyte with a scan rate of 5 mV s−1. The double-layer capacitances (Cdl) were tested by cyclic voltammetry (CV), with scan rates ranging from 40 to 120 mV s-1. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were conducted over a frequency range of 0.1 to 105 Hz with an amplitude of 5mV. Long-term stability was assessed through the chronopotentiometry test under 10 mA cm-2 for 12 h.

## **3. Results and Discussion**

Figure 1: Schematic illustration of synthesis procedure for Pt-CoFeP hollow cage.

Hollow cage of Pt-CoFeP with open holes in each facecentered position are successfully fabricated through alkali etching, platinum (Pt) loading and phosphating processes (Figure 1). The potassium hydroxide is supposed to act as a cavity creator during the cube-to-cage conversion process via the site-selective chemical etching [5]. Furthermore, the unique morphology plays a positive role in the high dispersion of Pt atoms.

Figure 2: (a) XRD patterns of Pt-CoFeP and other contrast samples. XPS spectra of Pt-CoFeP cage: (b) Co 2p; (c) Fe 2p; (d) P 2p; (e) Pt 4f.

The crystalline phase structure of Pt-CoFeP and other relative samples are characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD). As illustrated in Figure 2a, the diffraction peaks of CoFe PBA approximated at 17.513°, 24.865°, 35.452°, 43.788°, 51.009° and 57.554° belong to (200), (220), (400), (422), (440) and (620) crystal planes of Co2Fe(CN)6 (PDF No.01-075-0039), which is similar with that of e-CoFe PBA. Compared with the peaks of CoFe PBA and e-CoFe PBA, there exhibits a significant shift ,demonstrating that the introduction of Pt caused small lattice distortion [6]. However, no distinct dominating diffraction peaks can be observed, implying the amorphous charateristics of Pt-CoFeP [7].

To further explore the chemical structure of Pt-CoFeP, Xray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is carried out. As depicted in Figure 2b, two strong peaks at the binding energy of 781.6 and 797.5 eV are assigned to the Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2 of Co-P, respectively. The peaks at 785.7 and 802.7 eV belong to the oxidized Co species [8]. Meanwhile, in the hign-resolution spectrum of Fe 2p (Figure 2c), peaks located at 707.3 and 720.2 eV are attributed to Fe 2p3/2 and Fe 2p1/2 of Fe-P, respectively. And the peaks at 712.3 and 725.7 eVcan be ascribed to the oxidized Fe species [9]. In addition, the peaks (Figure 2d) at 129.5 and 130.3 eV are assignable to P 2p3/2 and P 2p1/2, respectively. While the peak at 133.7 eV is attributed to the oxidized P species [10]. These results implying the formation of CoFeP. Furthermore, a pair of weak peaks at 71.6 (Pt 4f7/2) and 74.9(Pt 4f5/2) can be observed in Pt 4f, proving the existence of Pt. Notablely, the characteristic peak of Pt exhibits positive shift, which indicates the electron transfer between Pt and Co/Fe [11]. This phenomenon implys that the optimized electron structure of Pt doped CoFeP may be one of important factors to enhance catalytic activity.

In order to reveal the structures of Pt-CoFeP and other contrast samples, scanning electron microscopy (SEM). As shown in Figure 3a and b, CoFe PBA are uniform dispersed nanocubes with the size of around 180-200 nm. While after alkali corrosion, the surface of e-CoFe PBA becomes rough, and significant holes can be observed on each face (Figure 3c, d). The large exposed surface area makes it possibel to provide more catalytic active sites, promoting the activity of traget catalyst. After loading Pt atoms and phosphating, Pt-CoFeP roufhly maintains the structure of nanocages.

Figure 4: (a,b) TEM images; (c) HRTEM image; (d) HAADF-STEM image and corresponding elemental mapping of Pt-CoFeP.

The transmission electron microscope (TEM) and Highresolution TEM (HRTEM) are tested to further explore the compositions of Pt-CoFeP. As shown in Figure 4a and b, porous structure can be clearly observed. Notablely, the inside of Pt-CoFeP exhibits hollow framework, which can provide numerous catalytic active site for oxygen evolution process. The abundance of dispersed black particles observed in the image is indicative of the presence of platinum. However, no significant lattice fringle can be observed in the HRTEM image (Figure 4c), indicating a low degree of crystallinity in the Pt-CoFeP, which is consistent with the conclusion drawn from XRD analysis. The high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopic (HAADF-STEM) images and relative elemental mapping (Figure 4d) illustrates that Co, Fe, P, C, N and O are uniformly dispersed in Pt-CoFeP. On the other hand, Pt is mainly confined within the structure of nanocages, providing further evidence for its doping and confined growth.

The electrocatalytic activities of Pt-CoFeP and other contrast samples toward OER under 1 M KOH electrolyte are evaluted by different electrochemical approaches. As demonstrated in Figure 5a, linear scan voltammetry (LSV) curve of Pt-CoFeP is tested with the scan rate of 5 mV s-1 on the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). The contrast samples, including Pt-CoFe PBA, e-CoFe PBA, CoFe PBA and commercial RuO2 are also tested for comparison. The overpotentials (Figure 5b) of Pt-CoFeP (*ƞ*10=311.7 mV, *ƞ*50=343.1 mV) are much lower than that of other contrast samples, especially for commercial RuO2. Besides, Pt-CoFeP possesses the lowest Tafel slope (48.1 mV dec-1) in Figure 5c, indicating the greatly optimized reaction kinetics during OER process. The Cdl of Pt-CoFeP electrode (Figure 5d) is estimated to be 22.8 mF cm-2, which indicates more exposed active site to enhance the water splitting process. In order to further explore the conductivity, charge-transfer resistance (Rct) kinetics of Pt-CoFeP. Rct of Pt-CoFeP (118.7 Ω) is much lower than that of other contrast samples. Thus, the optimized Pt-Co/Fe electronic structure and highly dispersed and confined growth of platinum, synergistically contributes to the improvement of the oxygen evolution reaction performance. In addition, the current density (10 mA cm-2 ) of Pt-CoFeP electrode maintains nearly invariable after 12 h long-term durability measurement.

## **4. Conclusion**

In summary, the hollow framework of Pt-CoFeP cage with open holes is successfully synthesized through alkali etching and phosphating processes. The target sample Pt-CoFeP, deriving from CoFe PBA shows excellent OER performance, which only requires 311.7 mV to reach the current density of 10 mA cm-2. The enhanced activity may be due to the synergistic effect of optimized Pt-Co/Fe electronic structure and highly dispersed Pt atoms. This work may provide a reference for the design of complex structures for highly dispersed Pt atoms loading.

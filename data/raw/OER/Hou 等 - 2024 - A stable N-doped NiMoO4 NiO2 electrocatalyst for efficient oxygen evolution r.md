# A stable N-doped NiMoO<sub>4</sub>/NiO<sub>2</sub> electrocatalyst for efficient oxygen evolution reaction†

Zhengfang Hou, Fangyuan Fan, Zhe Wang and Yeshuang Du 0 \*

Recently, there has been a significant interest in the study of highly active and stable transition metal-based electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Non-noble metal nanocatalysts with excellent inherent activity, many exposed active centers, rapid electron transfer, and excellent structural stability are especially promising for the displacement of precious-metal catalysts for the production of sustainable and "clean" hydrogen gas through water-splitting. Herein, efficient electrocatalyst N-doped nickel molybdate nanorods were synthesized on Ni foam by a hydrothermal process and effortless chemical vapor deposition. The heterostructure interface of N-NiMoO<sub>4</sub>/NiO<sub>2</sub> led to strong electronic interactions, which were beneficial for enhancing the OER activity of the catalyst. Excellent OER catalytic activity in 1.0 M KOH was shown, which offered a small overpotential of 185.6 mV to acquire a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> (superior to the commercial benchmark material RuO<sub>2</sub> under the same condition). This excellent electrocatalyst was stable for 90 h at a constant current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. We created an extremely reliable and effective OER electrocatalyst without the use of noble metals by doping a non-metal element with nanostructured heterojunctions of various active components.

## 1. Introduction

Energy and environmental issues have been attracting challenges threatening humans in recent decades.1 Worldwide demands for energy has grown rapidly with global development, along with fossil-fuel depletion, environmental pollution and global warming.<sup>2-4</sup> There is an urgent need to explore renewable and clean alternatives to solve these problems. Hydrogen is an environmentally friendly renewable energy source with high calorific value that can replace fossil fuels.<sup>5,6</sup> Electrochemical water-splitting is an ideal commercialized technology and effective route to produce hydrogen and involves the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). It is simple to process, emits no carbon dioxide and is very clean. The fundamental challenge in water electrolysis is to lower the high overpotentials at the anode and cathode, which are largely influenced by the microstructure, elemental composition, and surfaces of the electrocatalysts.7 Owing to the high activity and chemical stability in various solutions with different pH values, noble metal-based catalysts, such as Pt for the HER and Ir and Ru oxides for the OER, are regarded as industry

standards for water electrolysis. However, the widespread production of hydrogen gas through water-splitting is constrained by the high price and limited resource of rare platinum-group metals. Thus, reducing precious-metal contents (or even completely abandoning them) and searching for widespread nonnoble metal electrocatalysts with excellent activity and stability is important for the "hydrogen economy". 10,11

Most of the overpotentials produced in electrochemical water-splitting processes is caused by the OER, which has slower kinetics and higher activation-energy barriers than the HER because it includes multiple steps in the transfer of electrons and protons and has a complicated reaction mechanism. Thus, the OER is frequently seen as the "bottleneck" of water-splitting. The development of OER catalysts made entirely of elements that are abundant on Earth has been heavily researched. Many non-noble electrocatalysts have been shown to be active for the OER, including metal chalcogenides, 40 oxides, 15,16 nitrides, 17,18 and phosphides. 19,20

In recent decades, transition metal-based oxides have attracted much attention owing to their high catalytic activity and durability for the OER.<sup>21</sup> Because of their low price, abundance and special 3d electronic characteristics, metal oxides have become viable alternatives to precious metal-based electrocatalysts for effective electrochemical water-splitting.<sup>22</sup> Except for catalytic activity, the stability of electrocatalysts serve as a crucial indicator of commercial application. Numerous studies have shown that transition-metal chalcogenides, phosphides and nitrides could be readily oxidized to appropriate metal oxides during the OER

process. $^{23-25}$  Thus, non-noble metal oxides electrocatalysts should be very stable for the OER, and they have also been reported to be stable catalysts. Therefore, transition-metal oxides can be used as OER-active electrocatalysts with long-term stability. Many metal oxides have been shown to possess remarkable long-term durability, such as NiO/NiFe LDH,  $^{26}$  La<sub>0.9</sub>Ce<sub>0.1</sub>NiO<sub>3</sub>  $^{27}$  and NiCeO<sub>x</sub>. $^{28}$ 

The combination of transition-metal oxides and other active components to design a unique heterogeneous structure could significantly improve their OER performance because of produced abundant active sites along with a synergistic effect. For example, Wang *et al.* synthesized core–shell structured NiCo<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub>@NiMoO<sub>4</sub> nanosheets with excellent electrochemical properties.<sup>29</sup> In addition, Vomiero and colleagues synthesized core–shell structure NiMoO<sub>4</sub>@Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> catalysts that exhibited a very low OER overpotential of 120 mV at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>.<sup>30</sup>

To enhance the OER activity further, the structural design and surface-electron modulation are regarded as effective strategies. With little impact on the crystal structure, non-metal (anion) doping agents such as nitrogen (N) can modify the electronic structure and produce many active centers, resulting in optimal adsorption energy and improved electrocatalytic activity.<sup>31</sup> For instance, Li et al. successfully attached CoP nanoparticles to N-doped carbon/graphene and grew them on Ni foams (NC-G-CoP/NF). They exhibited impressive electrocatalytic activity in 1.0 M KOH solution, with small HER overpotentials of 68 mV at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, OER potential of 255 mV at 50 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, and 1.43 V at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> for overall water-splitting.<sup>32</sup> Besides, Zhong et al. reported novel N-doped Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub>/VS<sub>2</sub> heterostructures that showed enhanced catalytic performance with a very small OER overpotential of 227 mV and HER overpotential of 151 mV at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, respectively.33 Xi and colleagues fabricated N-NiMoO<sub>4</sub>/NiS<sub>2</sub> nanowires/nanosheets heterostructures on carbon fiber cloth as bifunctional electrocatalysts, obtaining 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> at a cell voltage of 1.60 V.<sup>34</sup> Therefore, a promising method to alter the electronic structure and promote the catalytic performance of an electrocatalyst would be to combine structural design and anion doping.

Therefore, we grew three-dimensional N-doped NiMoO<sub>4</sub>/NiO<sub>2</sub> nanorods directly on the surface of nickel foam *via* a simple hydrothermal synthetic method and doping with nitrogen element by chemical vapor deposition. Appropriate modification of mixed oxides electrocatalysts and 3D N-NiMoO<sub>4</sub>/NiO<sub>2</sub> nanorods heterostructures showed effective OER catalytic activity and good stability in alkaline solution. Besides, the 3D nanorods structure of N-doped NiMoO<sub>4</sub>/NiO<sub>2</sub> offered abundant active centers but also facilitated the entry of electrolyte and diffusion of bubbles. As expected, the as-synthesized N-NiMoO<sub>4</sub>/NiO<sub>2</sub>/NF was highly active for the OER with a low overpotential of 185.6 mV to acquire 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, and it remained stable at this potential for 90 h in 1.0 M KOH.

## 2. Experimental section

#### 2.1 Chemical and materials

Nickel nitrate hexahydrate ( $Ni(NO_3)_2 \cdot 6H_2O$ ), ammonium molybdate nonahydrate ( $NH_4$ )<sub>6</sub> $MO_7O_24 \cdot 9H_2O$ ), urea ( $NH_4$ ) and

potassium hydroxide (KOH) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd, China. All nickel foam used in experiments were from ShenZhen Tianchenghe Technology Co., Ltd, China. Nickel foam was cut into small pieces (2 cm  $\times$  3 cm) and cleaned by sonicating in HCl solution (3 mol L<sup>-1</sup>), ethanol and ultrapure water for 10 min, respectively.

#### 2.2 Preparation of electrocatalysts

**2.2.1 Preparation of Ni–Mo precursor.** A Ni–Mo precursor grown on nickel foam was prepared using a straightforward hydrothermal method. Dilute hydrochloric acid, ethanol and ultrapure water were used to initially remove the oxides and other impurities on the surface of conductive nickel foam substrate (2 cm  $\times$  3 cm). Then, 1 mmol of Ni(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>·6H<sub>2</sub>O and 1 mmol of (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>6</sub>Mo<sub>7</sub>O<sub>24</sub>·9H<sub>2</sub>O was dissolved in 15 mL of water to form a mixture solution. Then, a piece of cleaned nickel foam was placed in this mixture solution, and it were placed in an autoclave liner. The autoclave was heated at 160 °C for 6 h in the oven to create an Ni–Mo precursor. The synthesized precursor was washed thrice with ultrapure water and desiccated in an oven at 60 °C for a period of time.

2.2.2 Synthesis of N-NiMoO<sub>4</sub>/NiO<sub>2</sub>/NF. The prepared Ni-Mo precursor was placed in a clean porcelain boat, and 2 g of urea was weighed and placed in another porcelain boat. The two porcelain boats were placed in a tube furnace and urea was at the upstream side. They were heated up to 400 °C with a rate of 5 °C min<sup>-1</sup> in a nitrogen atmosphere and allowed to react at 400 °C for 2 h to obtain the final sample N-NiMoO<sub>4</sub>/NiO<sub>2</sub>/NF by simple chemical vapor deposition. For subsequent control experiments, the NiMoO<sub>4</sub>/NF nanomaterial was prepared with a similar process in the absence of N doping. Ni (OH)<sub>2</sub>/NF was prepared by the hydrothermal method using Ni (NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>·6H<sub>2</sub>O and urea as raw materials.

2.2.3 Preparation of RuO<sub>2</sub>/NF. First, 1.3 g of RuCl<sub>3</sub>·xH<sub>2</sub>O was dispersed in 50 mL of distilled water. Then, 5 mL of 1.0 M KOH was added to this solution, and the mixture was stirred at 100 °C for 45 min to produce RuO<sub>2</sub> power. After that, the sample was collected through centrifugation for 10 min, thoroughly rinsed with ultrapure water, and desiccated at 60 °C for several hours. To prepare a RuO<sub>2</sub>-decorated Ni foam, 5 mg of dried RuO<sub>2</sub> powder and 1 mL of 0.1% Nafion/isopropanol solution were ultrasonically treated for 30 min to create a uniform dispersion solution. Next, 1 mg of XC-72R was added to increase the inherent conductivity. The RuO<sub>2</sub> solution was dripped onto clean nickel foam, and the solvent allowed to evaporate naturally in air to obtain dried RuO<sub>2</sub>/NF.

#### 2.3 Physical characterizations

The crystal structure, morphology and surface composition of the synthesized catalyst were examined. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed on a D2 PHASER X-ray diffractometer (Bruker, Germany) using Cu K $\alpha$  radiation (30 kV, 10 mA) in the range of 10° and 80°. The morphology of synthesized N-NiMoO<sub>4</sub>/NiO<sub>2</sub> catalyst was characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) using a GeminiSEM 300 system and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) employing a Talos F200x system (200

kV; Thermo Fisher, USA). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was employed to measure the chemical states of the N-NiMoO<sub>4</sub>/NiO<sub>2</sub> catalyst using an ESCALAB MK II X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (Thermo Fisher).

#### 2.4 Electrochemical characterization

The OER performances of electrocatalysts were studied on the CHI 760E electrochemical workstation (Chenhua Shanghai, China) with a typical three-electrode system. The working electrode, reference electrode, and counter electrode were the prepared catalyst on nickel foam, Hg/HgO electrode and a graphite rod, respectively. The electrolyte was 1 mol L<sup>-1</sup> KOH. At room temperature, the electrocatalytic performance of the catalyst was estimated by the overpotential calculated from cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves in the range 0-0.8 V vs. Hg/HgO at a sweep rate of 5 mV s<sup>-1</sup>. The durability of the catalyst was assessed by chronopotentiometry (CP) at the constant current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was done in an appropriate frequency range. Double-layer capacitance (Cdl) of each electrocatalyst was obtained in the absence of faradaic current. The values of all obtained potentials appeared in this study were calibrated versus reversible hydrogen electrodes using the Nernst equation:

$$E_{\text{(RHE)}} = E_{\text{(Hg/HgO)}} + 0.059 \text{pH} + 0.098.$$

## 3. Results and discussion

#### 3.1 Structure and morphology

The synthesis of N-NiMoO $_4$ /NiO $_2$  contained two steps, as shown in Fig. 1. The Ni–Mo precursor grown on nickel foam was fabricated by a simple hydrothermal method, in which ammonium molybdate and nickel nitrate were used as Mo and Ni sources, respectively. Subsequently, N atoms were doped to the sample by a chemical vapor deposition method to construct a three-dimensional heterogeneous structure of N-NiMoO $_4$ /NiO $_2$  nanorods.

XRD characterization was used to analyze the crystalline structure and phase purity of N-NiMoO<sub>4</sub>/NiO<sub>2</sub> catalyst. The XRD pattern of the synthesized N-NiMoO<sub>4</sub>/NiO<sub>2</sub> sample is demonstrated in Fig. 2a. Distinct diffraction peaks appeared at 44.5°, 51.8° and 76.4°, which corresponded to the (111), (200) and (220) planes of Ni foam (JCPDS no. 04-0850). Diffraction peaks centered at 26.9°, 27.5°, 29.6° and 32.6° were the characteristic signals of the (220), (212), (302) and (222) crystal planes of NiMoO<sub>4</sub> (JCPDS no. 47-0775), respectively. Besides, peaks at 13.3°, 37.9°, 43.4° and 52.5°, could be indexed to the

(003), (012), (015) and (018) reflections of (H<sub>3</sub>O)·2NiO<sub>2</sub>, respectively (JCPDS no. 73-2408). These results indicated that the N-NiMoO<sub>4</sub>/NiO<sub>2</sub> catalyst contained different components with heterogeneous structures. The doping of N element did not affect the XRD pattern of N-NiMoO<sub>4</sub>/NiO<sub>2</sub>, which was possibly caused by the low concentration of N in the compound. Besides, the XRD spectra of Ni(OH)2 and NiMoO4 electrocatalysts are demonstrated in Fig. S1.† SEM characterization was used to explore the morphology of synthesized electrocatalysts. As displayed in Fig. 2b and c, three-dimensional N-NiMoO<sub>4</sub>/ NiO2 nanorods were grown on the nickel foam surface through a simple two-step synthesis. Their highly magnified SEM images show abundant nanorods grown on nickel foam with relatively smooth surfaces and diameter between 1 µm and 400 nm. These nanorods looks like "French fries." This unique three-dimensional structure is advantageous for exposing many active centers and promoting accessible electrolyte transfer and gas diffusion, which facilitates the OER area and boosts the OER activity of the electrocatalyst. In addition, TEM was used to examine the morphological property in more detail. The TEM image of a N-NiMoO<sub>4</sub>/NiO<sub>2</sub> nanorod is shown in Fig. 2d, further confirming the nanorods structure shown by SEM. Fig. 2e presents the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image of N-NiMoO<sub>4</sub>/NiO<sub>2</sub>. It clearly shows obvious fringes with interplanar distances of 0.576 nm and 0.210 nm, which correspond to the (200) plane of NiMoO<sub>4</sub> and (104) plane of NiO<sub>2</sub>, indicating that NiMoO4 and NiO2 exist in the material. This heterogeneous structure of N-NiMoO<sub>4</sub>/NiO<sub>2</sub> electrocatalyst in the TEM image was in accordance with the XRD result. Meanwhile, Ni, Mo, N and O elements were distributed uniformly across the whole N-NiMoO<sub>4</sub>/NiO<sub>2</sub> sample according to EDS element mapping images in Fig. 2f-j. Thus, N-NiMoO<sub>4</sub>/ NiO<sub>2</sub> nanorods with a three-dimensional heterogeneous structure were synthesized on the surface of nickel foam.

The surface element composition and chemical valence states of N-NiMoO<sub>4</sub>/NiO<sub>2</sub> were studied through XPS. The whole

XPS survey spectrum of N-NiMoO<sub>4</sub>/NiO<sub>2</sub> (Fig. S2†) confirmed the existence of the N, Ni, Mo, and O elements, which was consistent with EDS results. In more detail, the Mo 3d core level spectrum (Fig. 3a) displayed that the binding energies of 231.9 and 235.1 eV represented the characteristic peaks of Mo 3d<sub>5/2</sub> and Mo 3d<sub>3/2</sub>. The binding energies at 874.5, 873.2, 857.1 and 855.7 eV (Fig. 3b) were assigned to  $Ni^{3+} 2p_{1/2}$ ,  $Ni^{2+} 2p_{1/2}$ ,  $Ni^{3+}$  $2p_{3/2}$  and Ni<sup>2+</sup>  $2p_{3/2}$ , respectively. The remaining peaks at 862.2 and 880 eV could be indexed to shakeup satellites, revealing that Ni existed in the state of Ni<sup>3+</sup>/Ni<sup>2+</sup>. Besides, characteristic

peaks at 398.4 eV (Fig. 3c) were attributed to metal nitrides.<sup>35</sup> These peaks showed that N atoms had been doped to the electrocatalyst. This doped nitrogen could interact with metal elements, adjust the electronic structure of the electrocatalyst surface, offer abundant reactive species and lower activation enhanced resulting in an performance.36,37 Three peaks could be easily observed in the O 1s high-resolution spectrum (Fig. 3d). The peak of 529.9 eV was because of the incorporation of oxygen atoms with the metal.<sup>38</sup> The peak at 531.3 eV was associated with the hydroxyl species of water molecules adsorbed on the surface.<sup>39</sup> The peak at 530.5 eV was caused by many defect sites with a low oxygen coordination.40

#### 3.2 Electrocatalytic performance for OER

The OER activity of prepared N-NiMoO<sub>4</sub>/NiO<sub>2</sub> nanomaterial was investigated using the conventional three-electrode configuration in 1.0 M KOH solution. The fabricated materials were the working electrode, Hg/HgO served as the reference electrode and a carbon rod served as the counter electrode. In the same condition, the electrochemical activities of other catalysts, such as N-NiMoO<sub>4</sub>/NiO<sub>2</sub>, NiMoO<sub>4</sub>, Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> and RuO<sub>2</sub>, were also measured for comparison. Fig. 4a shows the CV plots of the prepared four electrocatalysts. The OER overpotential of N-NiMoO<sub>4</sub>/NiO<sub>2</sub> was 185.6 mV at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, which was much lower compared with other electrocatalysts. The overpotentials of NiMoO<sub>4</sub>, Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> and RuO<sub>2</sub> at the same current were 224 mV, 301 mV and 312 mV, respectively. Fig. 4b shows Tafel plots of N-NiMoO<sub>4</sub>/NiO<sub>2</sub>, NiMoO<sub>4</sub> and Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>. N-NiMoO<sub>4</sub>/NiO<sub>2</sub> had the smallest Tafel slope of 91.4 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>. The Tafel slopes of NiMoO<sub>4</sub> and Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> were 160 and 132.3 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. N-NiMoO<sub>4</sub>/NiO<sub>2</sub> had a faster reac-

tion rate, and the doped N in the electrocatalyst greatly boosted the OER by modulating the electron structure at the surface. N-NiMoO<sub>4</sub>/NiO<sub>2</sub> electrocatalysts had rapid reaction kinetics and outstanding inherent OER activity. Another crucial factor that affects the activities of electrocatalysts is the electrochemical active surface area (ECSA), which has a linear relationship with the double-layer capacitance ( $C_{\rm dl}$ ).  $C_{\rm dl}$  values of various electrocatalysts were calculated from the current densities and scan rates of CV curves in the non-faradaic region in Fig. S3.† As presented in Fig. 4c, N-NiMoO<sub>4</sub>/NiO<sub>2</sub> achieved a higher  $C_{\rm dl}$  (16.1 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>) than that of NiMoO<sub>4</sub> (1.36 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>) and Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> (1.57 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>), demonstrating that it had the highest  $C_{\rm dl}$  and ECSA among synthesized electrocatalysts, that is, N-NiMoO<sub>4</sub>/NiO<sub>2</sub> had more exposed accessible active centers on its surface, demonstrating the benefit of fabricating heterostructures for increasing the number of electrochemically accessible active sites.41 EIS was carried out to evaluate the ability of these samples to transport electrons and their electrode kinetics. Their Nyquist curves (Fig. 4d) showed that the charge-transfer resistance (Rct) of N-NiMoO<sub>4</sub>/NiO<sub>2</sub> was about 3  $\Omega$ , lower than that of NiMoO<sub>4</sub> (4  $\Omega$ ) and Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> (6  $\Omega$ ). These data indicated that N-NiMoO<sub>4</sub>/NiO<sub>2</sub> had improved reaction kinetics towards the OER. This phenomenon resulted in rapid electron transfer, which was ensured by the synergistic effect in heterostructures and N-atom doping (which was compatible with the outcome of the Tafel slope). A crucial metric for assessing commercial applications of electrocatalysts is corrosion resistance and stability. Thus, the stability of the fabricated N-NiMoO<sub>4</sub>/NiO<sub>2</sub> during long-time OER was examined. Fig. 4e reveals that the activity of N-NiMoO<sub>4</sub>/NiO<sub>2</sub> after 1000 CV scans was virtually unchanged compared with the pristine sample. There was no discernible activity decay or overpotential deterioration after 1000 CV cycles, thereby verifying the excellent stability and corrosion resistance of the N-NiMoO<sub>4</sub>/ NiO<sub>2</sub> electrocatalyst for the OER. The chronopotentiometry measurement was used to evaluate the long-term stability of the N-NiMoO<sub>4</sub>/NiO<sub>2</sub> catalyst. At 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, the OER overpotential of this N-NiMoO<sub>4</sub>/NiO<sub>2</sub> catalyst was almost unchanged; it exhibited robust durability with minimal deterioration, and it was stable for ≥90 h (Fig. 4f). Other related electrochemical catalysts were investigated, and their electrochemical performance and chemical stability is shown in Fig. S4.† The OER activity and durability of N-NiMoO<sub>4</sub>/NiO<sub>2</sub> in this work is superior to that of most electrocatalysts. Fig. S5† shows the SEM images of the N-NiMoO<sub>4</sub>/NiO<sub>2</sub> electrocatalyst after a stability test for 90 h. The surface of N-NiMoO<sub>4</sub>/NiO<sub>2</sub> became rough and nanorods were thinner. This change in morphology may have been caused by compositional variation during long-term OER. The XRD pattern of N-NiMoO<sub>4</sub>/NiO<sub>2</sub> after a stability test (Fig. S6†) was also changed and some diffraction peaks disappeared or became weaker, leaving the characteristic signals of metal nickel, nickel oxide and some small peaks. This occurred because the catalyst had reached an amorphous phase after long-term OER. The difference in valence states of element was obvious before and after the stability test. The XPS peak of Ni 2p<sub>3/2</sub> (Fig. S7†) shifted to a higher binding

energy compared with pristine sample, indicating that the electron density increased and the appearance of NiOOH. Besides, the amount of Mo became significantly low because the XPS peaks of Mo 3d disappeared. The reason is probably that NiMoO4 was converted to amorphous NiOOH/Ni(OH)2 under alkaline and high-potential conditions, and molybdenum had run-off the surface. After the dissolution of molybdate, hydroxyl groups in the electrolyte combined with exposed nickel sites to form amorphous hydroxyl layers at surface dissolution sites.42 Hence, the molybdate ion was dissolved in solution, which caused the change in XPS and XRD results. This was why the intensity of the Mo XPS peak was low, and the XRD peaks of NiMoO4 disappeared. During the leaching of Mo, N-NiMoO<sub>4</sub>/NiO<sub>2</sub> nanorods became loose. This action contributed to the generation of NiOOH and mass transport. In conclusion, the surface reconstruction of N-doped NiMoO<sub>4</sub>/ NiO2 catalyst occurred in a strongly alkaline solution to form NiOOH. It has been reported that the metal hydroxide/oxyhydroxide formed at catalyst surfaces during the OER act as active materials for the OER, which is beneficial due to its high catalytic activity. 43 The generated oxygen gas was collected to calculate the faradaic efficiency. Fig. S8† presents the measured volume and theoretical volume of oxygen gas. The OER faradaic efficiency was calculated to be about 97%.

### 4. Conclusions

In conclusion, a straightforward two-step approach of a hydrothermal method and chemical vapor deposition was effectively used to build three-dimensional, N-doped NiMoO4/NiO2 nanorods with a heterogeneous structure on the surface of NF. Strong electrical interactions were produced owing to the integration of NiMoO4 and NiO2 into a heterogeneous structure with many M-O bonds (M = Mo, Ni), which helped to enhance the OER activity. The charge transfer and OER reaction kinetics were significantly accelerated by the synergistic interaction between NiMoO<sub>4</sub> and NiO<sub>2</sub> as well as N doping, respectively. NiMoO4 and NiO2 acted as an effective oxide protective shell, which improved the stability of the OER significantly. Furthermore, the three-dimensional nanorod structure enabled exposure of more reactive sites, hastening the entry of the electrolyte and bubble diffusion. Therefore, in contrast to recently reported non-precious-metal catalysts, N-NiMoO<sub>4</sub>/ NiO<sub>2</sub> created in this work showed outstanding OER activity and stability in a basic electrolyte. This N-NiMoO<sub>4</sub>/NiO<sub>2</sub> afforded a small OER overpotential of 185.6 mV to drive a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, with satisfactory stability at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> for 90 h. Therefore, a lower cost of fabrication of N-NiMoO<sub>4</sub>/NiO<sub>2</sub> could be a prospective candidate for largescale applications of electrochemical water-splitting.

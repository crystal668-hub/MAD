Abstract: Electrocatalytic splitting of water is becoming increasingly crucial for renewable energy and device technologies. As one of the most important half-reactions for water splitting reaction, oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a kinetically sluggish process that will greatly affect the energy conversion efficiency. Therefore, exploring a highly efficient, and durable catalyst to boost the OER is of great urgency. In this work, we develop a facile strategy for synthesis of well-defined phosphorus, fluorine co-doped Ni<sub>1.5</sub>Co<sub>1.5</sub>N hybrids nanorods (HNs) by using ionic liquids (1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate, ILs). In comparison to the IrO2 catalyst, the as-obtained PF/Ni<sub>1.5</sub>Co<sub>1.5</sub>N HNs manifests a low overpotential of 280 mV at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, Tafel slope of 66.1 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>, and excellent durability in 1.0 M KOH solution. Furthermore, the iR-corrected electrochemical results indicate it could achieve a current density of 100 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> at an overpotential of 350 mV. The combination of cobalt and nickel elements, 1D mesoporous nanostructure, heteroatoms incorporation, and ionic liquids assisted nitridation, which result in faster charge transfer capability and more active surface sites, can facilitate the release of oxygen bubbles from the catalyst surface. Our findings confirm that surface heteroatoms doping in bimetallic nitrides could serve as a new class of OER catalyst with excellent catalytic activity.

#### Introduction

Severe energy crisis and environmental pollution issues have ignited great passion for developing sustainable energy storage and conversion device. [1-6] As one of the most important half-reactions in water splitting and promising strategy for solving the energy crisis, OER has attracted great attention in recent years. [7-10] However, the sluggish kinetic reaction toward OER usually suffers from complex thermodynamic process thus needs extra potential to boost the catalysis. [11-15] In this regard, highly efficient electrocatalysts with low overpotential are expected to accelerate the kinetics and promote the catalytic

Thus, designing highly active catalysts with low overpotential ( $\eta$ ), small Tafel slope, and superior chemical stability for OER becomes an extremely urgent topic to be pursued.

Over the past few decades, metal nitrides have gained enormous interest as low-cost promising catalysts for water oxidation.[28] It has been established that the N atoms can modulate the electronic and geometric structures of the metal nitrides thus provide more active surface sites owing to their enhanced electronic conductivity and electronegativity difference between N and metal atoms. [29] Theoretical calculations and catalytic results have proved that the metal nitrides exhibited excellent catalytic activities towards OER, with low onset potential and Tafel slope, due to the high electrical conductivity and disorder structure feature.[30-31] Great efforts have been devoted to metallic nitrides catalysts with low overpotential and Tafel slope.[32] The combination of different metal elements, which can afford more active surface sites and improve electrical conductivity has also been largely reported to modulate their chemical/physical properties. However, to our knowledge, bimetallic nitrides and their surface heteroatoms doping jointly promote OER performance in alkaline solution have not been reported to date, and the related study on the nitrides surface doping is just beginning.

Herein, we report a well-defined phosphorus, fluorine dual-doped Ni<sub>1.5</sub>Co<sub>1.5</sub>N HNs as a highly efficient OER catalyst. Benefiting from the surface doping, nitridation, and the strong synergistic interactions among Ni, Co, and heteroatoms, the PF/Ni<sub>1.5</sub>Co<sub>1.5</sub>N catalyst manifests excellent catalytic activity and stability in 1.0 M KOH solution, as demonstrated by a small onset potential of 1.42 V vs RHE, overpotential of 280 mV at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, and Tafel slope of 66.1 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>. The designing of the heteroatoms doped bimetallic nitrides demonstrates the importance of composition and structural feature for boosting catalytic activity. And our finding confirms that surface metalloid doping over bimetallic nitrides could serve as a new class of OER catalysts with superior catalytic activity.

#### **Results and Discussion**

In this paper, the synthetic strategies for the PF/Ni<sub>1.5</sub>Co<sub>1.5</sub>N HNs involve the following steps as schematically exhibited in Scheme 1. In the first step, ionic liquid (BMIMPF<sub>6</sub>) was injected to a mixed solution of Ni<sup>2+</sup>, Co<sup>2+</sup>, hydrazine hydrate, deionized water, and ethanol solution (Ni: Co=1:1, mass ratio). Subsequently, the mixture was vigorously stirred and transferred into an autoclave and then subjected to a solvothermal treatment. Interestingly, nanorods and nanosheets microstructures were obtained

correspond to N, P, and F tri-doped Ni(OH) $_2$  and Co(OH) $_2$  precursors, respectively (Scheme 1). Finally, a subsequent annealing process in NH $_3$  was utilized to transform the Ni-Co hydroxides precursor hybrids into bimetallic nitrides PF/Ni $_{1.5}$ Co $_{1.5}$ N. And the temperature was carefully adjusted to optimize their structures and catalytic activities. Annealing treatment of the ionic liquid modified hydroxide precursors could, not only afford heteroatom sources for co-doping with phosphorus (P) and fluorine (F), respectively, but also contribute to the formation of Ni-Co bimetallic nitrides catalysts.

**Scheme 1.** Schematic illustration of the fabrication processes for PF/Ni<sub>1.5</sub>Co<sub>1.5</sub>N nanorods (NIN).

The crystallinity and phase purity of the catalysts were confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurement (Figure 1, Figure S1). The P, F dual-doped Ni<sub>1.5</sub>Co<sub>1.5</sub>N nitride synthesized with 400 mg of ILs and calcined at 400 °C in NH3, is denoted as NIN (nitride-lonic liquids-NH<sub>3</sub>), NN represents the Ni<sub>1.5</sub>Co<sub>1.5</sub>N catalyst prepared without ILs and calcined at 400 °C in NH<sub>3</sub>, and NIA represents the catalyst prepared with 400 mg of ILs and calcined in air. Compared with the NN, the diffraction peaks of NIN are significantly broadened and enhanced, indicating the fine nature of the nanoparticles and higher degree of nitridation and crystallization. [33] After calcined in NH3, all of the identified (111), (002), and (110) planes for the NIN and NN samples can be attributed to the hexagonal Ni<sub>3</sub>N (No.10-0820).<sup>[33]</sup> The relative intensity of the peaks of NIN are higher than those in the pattern of of NN. This may be attributed to the ionic liquid N incorporation with the bimetallic nitride. Ionic liquid N species occupies the N lattice sites of Ni<sub>3</sub>N and increases the peaks intensity. The XRD patterns of NIN are almost the same as the hexagonal Ni<sub>3</sub>N, indicating that the Co elements have successfully occupied certain positions of Ni in hexagonal Ni<sub>3</sub>N without structural changes. To further confirm the composition of the heteroatom doped Ni<sub>1.5</sub>Co<sub>1.5</sub>N hybrids (NIN), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) was performed in this study (Figure 2a). It confirms the existence of Co and Ni in an atomic ratio of 12.95:10.78, which agrees well with the initial ratio of the precursors (Ni(NO)<sub>3</sub>:Co(NO)<sub>3</sub>=1:1), showing the effectiveness of the nitridation strategy in the synthesis of bimetallic nitride. Meanwhile, the molar ratio of Co: Ni is close to 1:1, and Co elements have occupied certain positions of Ni in

 $Ni_3N$ . Therefore, the formula of NiCo-based bimetallic nitride hybrid can be denoted as  $Ni_{1.5}Co_{1.5}N$ . After calcined at high temperature in air, the NIA catalyst exhibits diffraction peak of (200) plane corresponding to  $Ni_xCo_{1.x}O$  nanocrystals. And the ionic liquid, which can promote partial nitridation and convert hydroxide into nitride in air, creates the possibility of developing another novel nitridation process and enhancing the nitridation degree.

**Figure 1.** XRD patterns of Ni-Co (1:1) based bimetallic nitrides synthesized under different conditions (inset shows the unit cell of Ni<sub>1.5</sub>Co<sub>1.5</sub>N, NIN was prepared with 400 mg of ILs and calcined at 400 °C in NH<sub>3</sub>, NN represents the Ni<sub>1.5</sub>Co<sub>1.5</sub>N catalyst prepared without ILs and calcined at 400 °C in NH<sub>3</sub>, NIA represents the catalyst prepared with 400 mg of ILs and calcined in air.)

Further insights into the heterojunction structure and morphology of the heteroatom doped hydroxides precursors and nitrides were systematically investigated by SEM and TEM. The bimetallic nitride Ni<sub>1.5</sub>Co<sub>1.5</sub>N synthesized without ionic liquids (NN) exhibits lamellar morphology (Figure 2b). Interestingly, after adding the ionic liquid into the system, the morphology of the catalyst changed from nanosheets to nanorods. As observed from Figure 2c-2h, Figure S2, and Figure S3, the morphologies of the hydroxides precursors and the bimetallic nitrides were exhibited nanorods arrays with average length and diameter of 6 μm×200 nm. And layered structure of Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> precursor was observed from Figure S2d-S2f. After calcined at high temperature in NH<sub>3</sub>, numerous layered structure of Co<sub>2</sub>N<sub>0.67</sub> attached onto the surface of the Ni<sub>3</sub>N nanorods and formed a heterojunction structure of Ni<sub>3</sub>N/Co<sub>3</sub>N hybrids (Co<sub>x</sub>Ni<sub>3-x</sub>N, Figure 2f). High resolution TEM (Figure 2g) image further indicated that the spacing of 0.192 nm can be easily observed and attributed to the (111) lattice planes of the Ni<sub>3</sub>N (0.20 nm). [33] This matched well the caculated result from XRD patterns. The reason for the smaller interplanar spacing may be due to the introduction of cobalt in the lattice of nickel nitride, which occupies the N lattice sites in Ni<sub>3</sub>N. The HAADF-STEM and elemental mapping were also performed to investigate the element distribution in these hybrids (inset in Figure 2d, Figure 2e, inset in Figure 2g, and Figure 2h). It indicated that the hydroxides precursors and the annealed nitrides catalysts observed as dots are well-dispersed. and the heteroatoms N, P, and F are evenly distributed in the whole nanorods, further demonstrated the formation of the bimetallic nitrides and the heterojunction structure (Figure S4 and Figure S5).

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out to ascertain the valence states and compositions of these catalysts. As observed from the experimental and fitted spectra (Figure 3. Figure S6), it indicates that the as-obtained NIN and NIA catalysts consist of Ni, Co, O, N, P, and F, respectively. The core-level peaks of Ni 2p spectrum for NN and NIN at around 857.6 and 875.4 eV, ascribed to the  $2p_{3/2}$  and  $2p_{1/2}$  of Ni<sup>2+</sup>, respectively, [34,35] accompanying with a couple of satellite peaks located at 862.1 eV and 881.0 eV (Figure 3a).[35] The other two peaks at 853.8 (2p<sub>1/2</sub>) and 871.0 eV (2p<sub>1/2</sub>) indicate metallic state of Ni<sup>0</sup>, suggesting that oxidized state of Ni<sup>2+</sup> was partially reduced under NH<sub>3</sub> atmosphere. [36-37] The peaks of metallic state for Ni in the NIA catalyst were disappeared after calcined in air. The binding energy of the Co 2p<sub>3/2</sub> (Figure 3b) in NN catalyst exhibits two peaks at about 797.8 eV and 782.3 eV, attributed to the  $2p_{1/2}$  and  $2p_{3/2}$  of  $Co^{2+}$ , respectively, whereas two satellite peaks are located at 786.5 eV and 803.7 eV.[38-41] Moreover, the peak at 779.6 eV can be ascribed to the metallic state of Co<sup>0</sup>.[42, <sup>43]</sup> The ionic liquid induced the peaks of the Ni and Co in the NIN and NIA catalysts all positively shift 0.6 eV compared with that of the NN catalyst. The peak located at 532.5 eV and 531.4 eV were ascribed to the chemisorbed oxygen (Oads) and lattice oxygen (O<sub>lat</sub>), respectively (Figure 3c). The N 1s spectra of the catalysts were investigated and compared to assess the possible Ni-N and Co-N interactions (Figure 3d). For both NN and NIN, two different nitrogen species can be observed from the N 1s spectra at 397.9 or 398.3 eV (N1), 399.3 (N2), which can be attributed to metal nitride peak (i.e., -3 N in Ni-N bonds), [37] Co-N<sub>x</sub> structure, [44,45] respectively. Interestingly, negative shift of N1 from 398.3 (NN) to 397.3 eV (NIN) can be

distinguished from the Figure 3d. The negative shift of N1 and positive shift of Ni 2p and Co 2p, demonstrating the strong electron interactions among Ni, Co, and N atoms in the bimetallic nitrides.[46] Ionic liquid induced great changes in chemical environment and resulted in a negative and positive shifts of binding energy, which are mainly close related to the changes in the Fermi energy, the band center, and the work function.[47] Owing to higher electronegativity of N (3.04) than Ni (1.91) and Co (1.88), the modified electronic structures, electrical conductivity, and stronger electron interactions between the Ni<sub>1.5</sub>Co<sub>1.5</sub>N and heteroatoms, might be favorable for their electrochemical catalytic performance. [48] Furthermore, the quantitative analysis results derived from the N 1s spectra were summarized in the Figure 5g. It can be seen that the ionic liquid induce an enhancement for the nitrogen species in these catalysts. And the nitrogen species content is 1.34 at.% (NIA), 4.92 at.% (NN), and 7.89 at.% (NIN), respectively. The N 1s spectra for NIA at around 397.9, 400.3, 402.8, and 403.8 eV, ascribed to metal nitride peak (N1), pyrrolic N (N2), graphitic N (N3), and oxidized N (N4), respectively. [49] The peak of P 2p at about 133.5 eV can be ascribed to the oxidized P species. indicating the presence of a P-O bond (Figure 3e). [50] The F 1s spectra for the NIN catalyst exhibits ionic (685.4 eV) and semiionic (688.9 eV) state (Figure 3f).[50] Having high concentration and electronegativity, N and P are probably promising heteroatoms to redistribute the charge distribution, and thus significantly promote catalytic performance.

The electrocatalytic performances of the heteroatoms doped  $\text{Co}_x \text{Ni}_{3-x} \text{N}$  catalysts for OER were characterized using a typical three-electrode system in 1.0 M KOH solution (pH=14). Figure 4a shows the LSV curves of the electrodes without iR compensation. As observed, the PF/Ni<sub>1.5</sub>Co<sub>1.5</sub>N (NIN) catalyst exhibits an early onset potential (~1.42 V vs. RHE) than that of other annealed catalysts. At the current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, the NIN catalyst exhibits an overpotential of 280 mV versus RHE, which is obviously lower than the other heteroatoms doped catalysts. The overpotential of the heteroatoms doped samples

increased in the order of Ni<sub>1.5</sub>Co<sub>1.5</sub>N (280 mV) < Co<sub>2.25</sub>Ni<sub>0.75</sub>N (290 mV) < Ni<sub>3</sub>N (300 mV) < Co<sub>3</sub>N (310 mV) < Co<sub>0.75</sub>Ni<sub>2.25</sub>N (330 mV). The excellent catalytic performance of NIN is superior than that of other cobalt-nickel based catalysts in alkaline solution (Table S1, Figure 4c). [51-52] And a detailed comparison for various OER catalysts with different components highlights the excellent electrocatalytic performance of NIN (Table S2).

Tafel slope was also utilized to estimate the OER kinetics of the catalysts. The Tafel slope for the NIN is fitted to 66.1 mV dec $^{-1}$ , which is lower than that of the PF/Ni $_3$ N (81.0 mV dec $^{-1}$ ), PF/Co $_3$ N (86.2 mV dec $^{-1}$ ), PF/Ni $_0.75$ Co $_2.25$ N (77.5 mV dec $^{-1}$ ), and PF/Ni $_2.25$ Co $_0.75$ N (109.2 mV dec $^{-1}$ ), indicating excellent catalytic kinetics (Table S1, Figure 4b). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) further demonstrated that the NIN catalyst exhibits smaller charge transfer resistance compared with the PF/Ni $_3$ N, PF/Co $_3$ N, PF/Ni $_0.75$ Co $_2.25$ N, and PF/Ni $_2.25$ Co $_0.75$ N catalysts, indicating a faster electron transfer rate during oxygen evolution reaction (Figure 4d and Figure S7b).  $^{[53]}$  Furthermore, the polarization curve performed 1000 cycles and chronoamperometric response lines were used to investigate the

durability of the PF/Ni<sub>1.5</sub>Co<sub>1.5</sub>N electrocatalyst. It indicates that the NIN can maintain high catalytic stability in alkaline solution (Figure 4e and Figure 4f).

In our synthesis, it is noteworthy that the N, P, and F atoms derived from ionic liquid have significant effects on improving OER catalytic activity. Figure 5a indicates that the overpotential and the Tafel slopes of the samples decreased in the order of IrO<sub>2</sub> > NN> NIA > NIN. The mass activity, specific activity, and turn over frequency (TOF) of the NIN are calculated to be 122 A  $g^{-1}$ , 0.44 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, and 1.4×10<sup>-3</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>, respectively, much higher than the NN and NIA catalysts (Table 1). This result clearly illustrate that the excellent catalytic activity of NIN compared with NN and NIA mainly ascribe to the N and P atoms incorporation with Ni and Co atoms, and their surface slit-type pore structures (Figure 5b, Figure S8, and Figure S10). The content of N and P derived from ionic liquid in NIN catalyst dramatically increased (Figure 5g), thus promoted the OER catalytic performance. Furthermore. the iR-corrected electrochemical results indicate that the NIN could achieve current density of 50 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> and 100 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> at overpotential of 310 mV and 350 mV, respectively (Figure 5c). It should be emphasized that the excellent catalytic performance of NIN is far superior than that of the reported cobalt-nickel based nitrides catalysts in alkaline solution.<sup>[53-54]</sup> The capacitance of the PF/Ni<sub>1.5</sub>Co<sub>1.5</sub>N (NIN) is 14.0 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>, and the NIN electrode exhibits larger electrochemical double-layer capacitance (Cdl) than the NIA and NN catalysts, suggesting remarkable proliferation of catalytically active sites and thus high catalytic activity towards the OER (Figure S9).

To assess the stability of heteroatoms doped structures (i.e.,  $PF/Ni_{1.5}Co_{1.5}N$ ) and  $NPF/Ni_{1.5}Co_{1.5}N$ ), we calculated their formation energy using following Equation:

$$\Delta E_f = E_{X/Ni1.5Co1.5N} - E_{Ni1.5Co1.5N} - \mu_N - \mu_P - \mu_F$$

where  $E_{Ni1.5Co1.5N}$  and  $E_{X/Ni1.5Co1.5N}$  are the total energies of isolated and doped  $Ni_{1.5}Co_{1.5}N$ , respectively.  $\mu_N$ ,  $\mu_P$ , and  $\mu_F$  are the chemical potential of N, P, and F atom defined as the total energy per atom in bulk phase, respectively. The most stable optimization configurations of  $Ni_{1.5}Co_{1.5}N$ , PF/ $Ni_{1.5}Co_{1.5}N$ , and NPF/ $Ni_{1.5}Co_{1.5}N$  are shown in Figure 5d-Figure 5f. Our DFT calculations show that the formation energy of PF/ $Ni_{1.5}Co_{1.5}N$  is -4.73 eV, lower than that of NPF/ $Ni_{1.5}Co_{1.5}N$  (i.e., -4.60 eV), which indicates that PF/ $Ni_{1.5}Co_{1.5}N$  is more stable after the doping. Therefore, PF/ $Ni_{1.5}Co_{1.5}N$  is chosen to investigate the OER mechanism in alkaline media.

To illustrate the higher electrocatalytic activity of PF/Ni<sub>1.5</sub>Co<sub>1.5</sub>N than Ni<sub>1.5</sub>Co<sub>1.5</sub>N, it is useful to consider the reaction mechanism using the density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which are shown in Figure 6. The optimized structures of the substrates (i.e., Ni<sub>1.5</sub>Co<sub>1.5</sub>N and PF/Ni<sub>1.5</sub>Co<sub>1.5</sub>N) and the intermediates (i.e., \*OH, \*O, \*OOH, and \*O<sub>2</sub>) involved in the mechanism are also shown in Figure 6a and 6b, respectively.

The Gibbs free energy changes for the OER elementary steps catalyzed by Ni1.5Co1.5N and PF/Ni1.5Co1.5N are shown in Figure 6c. In alkaline media, the OER is usually considered as the following processes (1) - (5):

$$OH^{-} + * \rightarrow *OH + e^{-}$$
 (1)

$$OH^- + *OH \rightarrow *O + H_2O + e^-$$
 (2)

$$^*O + OH^- \rightarrow ^*OOH + e^-$$
 (3)

\*OOH + OH
$$^{-} \rightarrow ^{*}O_{2} + H_{2}O + e^{-}$$
 (4)

$$^*O_2 \rightarrow ^* + O_2$$
 (gas form) (5)

where \* represents the catalyst surface. The reaction starts with the adsorption of OH- with the catalyst surface to form the adsorbed OH species (step 1). Then, \*OH reacts with OH to form the adsorbed O species \*O, and a H2O molecular and an electron are released (step 2). Following, the remained \*O reacts with OHto form the adsorbed OOH species (step 3). In the sequence, \*OOH further reacts with OHto form the adsorbed O2, and a H2O molecular and an electron are released (step 4). Finally, the adsorbed O<sup>2</sup> desorbs from the catalyst surface (step 5). As is well known, the overpotential (η) plays a crucial role for describing the OER activity of electrocatalysts, which can be calculated as the Gibbs free energy differences (ΔGi, i =1, 2, 3, and 4) for each reaction step [55] :

$$\eta = \text{Max} \left[ \Delta G_1, \Delta G_2, \Delta G_3, \Delta G_4 \right] / e - 1.23 [V]$$

As can be seen from Figure 6c, the largest free energy difference is occurred in ΔG<sup>2</sup> for PF/Ni1.5Co1.5N and Ni1.5Co1.5N. Moreover, the overpotential is in the order of PF/Ni1.5Co1.5N<Ni1.5Co1.5N, suggesting the better OER catalytic activity in PF/Ni1.5Co1.5N, which confirms our experimental observation.

**Figure 7**. Schematic illustration of the OER catalytic mechanism for the heteroatom doped Ni1.5Co1.5N catalysts.

The excellent OER electrocatalytic activity of the PF/Ni1.5Co1.5N catalyst in our synthesis can be ascribed to the heteroatoms surface doping, double nitridation (NH3+ILs), the synergistic effects between bimetallic nitrides and heteroatoms, 1D mesoporous structure, and multiple active surface sites (Figure 7). First, the combination of cobalt and nickel nitrides endows faster electrical conductivity and charge transfer capability between the current collector and the catalyst surface, favoring high OER properties. Second, the nanorods arrays morphology and mesoporous structure are expected to afford more active surface sites and facilitate the release of oxygen bubbles towards OER, to promote and accelerate the reaction diffusion kinetics in the electrolyte. Third, the in situ generated N, P, and F species on the surface of Ni1.5Co1.5N can provide multiple active surface sites for OER, and the bimetallic nickel-cobalt nitrides with low charge transfer resistance can promote electron transfer rate. Therefore, these synergetic advantages endow the heteroatoms doped bimetallic nitrides to achieve superior OER catalytic activity.

#### **Conclusions**

In summary, we have developed a novel well-defined phosphorus, fluorine dual-doped bimetallic nitride nanorod as a highly efficient OER catalyst. Owing to their surface heteroatoms doping, double nitridation, strong synergistic interactions among Ni, Co, and heteroatoms, 1D mesoporous nanorods structure, and multiple active surface sites, the novel hierarchical PF/Ni1.5Co1.5N catalysts manifest excellent catalytic performance and stability towards OER in alkaline solution, as demonstrated by a low onset potential of 1.42 V vs RHE, overpotential of 280 mV at 10 mA cm-2 , Tafel slope of 66.1 mV dec-1 , and excellent durability in 1.0 M KOH solution. DFT calculations demonstrate the heteroatoms doped hybrid nanorods structure can lower the Gibbs free energy and overpotential thus boost the OER catalysis. Our finding confirms that surface metalloid doping in bimetallic nitrides could serve as a new class of OER catalysts with superior catalytic activity. And this work prompts investigations into the direct grafting of active surface sites onto the surface of catalysts by heteroatoms, and paves a new way to design advanced metallic nitrides catalysts.

#### **Experimental Section**

**Synthesis of Ni1.5Co1.5N catalyst (NN)**. All the chemicals were directly used after purchase without further purification. In a typical synthesis, 10 mg Ni(NO)3·6H2O and 10 mg Co(NO)3·6H2O were dissolved in the mixed solution, which was consisted by 10 mL deionized water and 10 mL ethanol. Then, 0.4 mL of hydrazine hydrate (HHA) was added into the above mixture. The mixed solution was continuously stirred for 2 h at room temperature. Finally, the solution was transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and maintained at 150 C for 10 h. After the autoclave cooled down to room temperature, the as-obtained powder was washed with deionized water and ethanol for three times and dried at 80 C overnight. Then the precursor was calcined at 400 C for 3 h in NH<sup>3</sup> atmosphere with the heating rate of 5 C/min. The sample was cooled down to room temperature, and collected for further characterization.

**Synthesis of PF/Ni1.5Co1.5N (NIN)**. In a typical synthesis, 10 mg of Ni(NO)3·6H2O, 10 mg of Co(NO)3·6H2O, and 400 mg of ionic liquid (1 butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate, IL) were dissolved in the solution, which was mixed by 10 mL deionized water and 10 mL ethanol. Then, 0.4 mL of hydrazine hydrate (HHA) was added into the above mixture. The mixed solution was continuously stirred for 2 h at room temperature. Finally, the solution was transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and maintained at 150 C for 10 h. After the autoclave cooled down to room temperature, the as-obtained powder was washed with deionized water and ethanol for three times and dried at 80 C overnight. Then the precursor was calcined at 400 C for 3 h in NH<sup>3</sup> atmosphere with the heating rate of 5 C/min. The sample was cooled down to room temperature, and collected for further characterization.

**Synthesis of P, F doped Ni-Co nitrides/oxides hybrids (NIA).** 10 mg of Ni(NO)3·6H2O, 10 mg of Co(NO)3·6H2O, and 400 mg of ionic liquid (BMIMPF6) dissolved in the solution, which was mixed by 10 mL deionized water and 10 mL ethanol. Then, 0.4 mL of hydrazine hydrate (HHA) was added into the above mixture. The mixed solution was continuously stirred for 2 h at room temperature. Finally, the solution was transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and maintained at 150 C for 10 h. After the autoclave cooled down to room temperature, the as-obtained powder was washed with deionized water and ethanol for three times and dried at 80 C overnight. Then the precursor was calcined at 400 C for 3 h in Air atmosphere with the heating rate of 5 C /min. The sample was cooled down to room temperature, and collected for further characterization. As-prepared hydroxides precursors were treated at 400 C for 3 h in NH3, resulting in two calcined catalysts, that is, Ni1.5Co1.5N catalyst (NN, in the absence of ionic liquids), P, F doped Ni1.5Co1.5N nitrides catalysts (NIN, in the presence of 400 mg of ionic liquid, 1-butyl-3-methyl-imidazolium hexafluorophosphate, BMIMPF6). Furthermore, the heteroatom doped Ni-Co hydroxides precursors was treated at 400 C for 3 h in Air, resulting P, F doped Ni-Co based nitrides/oxides catalysts (NIA).

**Materials characterization.** X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) was performed using a PuXi XD3 diffractometer with graphite monochromatized Cu-Kα radiation (λ=0.15406 nm). The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were performed on JEOL-JSM 6700- F SEM. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) elemental mapping were taken on JEM-2010 system and a HITACHI 800 operating at acceleration voltages of 120 kV and 200 kV, respectively. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were obtained on an ESCALAB 250 X-ray electron spectrometer using Al-Kα radiation.

**Electrochemical measurements.** Electrochemical measurements were carried out using a CHI 760E electrochemical workstation (ChenHua, Shanghai, China) with an three-electrode system at room temperature. Typically, 5 mg catalyst mixed with 25 μL Nafion® solution (5 %) were dispersed in 250 μL water and 250 μL ethanol, and ultrasonicated for 30 min to form a homogeneous ink. Then, 2 μL dispersion solution was deposited onto the glassy-carbon rotating disk electrode (RDE) with an area of 0.0707 cm<sup>2</sup> (3.0 mm in diameter). The reference electrode was Ag/AgCl electrode and the counter electrode was Pt wire. Linear-sweep voltammetry was performed at a scan rate of 10 mV s -1 in O2-saturated 1.0 M KOH solutions for at least 30 min. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopies (EIS) were carried out at 0.6 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) in a frequency from range 100 KHz to 100 MHz with an amplitude of 5 mV. To evaluate the electrochemical active surface area of the catalysts, the electrochemical double-layer capacitance (Cdl) of the samples in 1.0 M KOH solution was measured by using cyclic voltammetry (CV) in a non-Faradaic region at different scan rates. The electrochemical cell was assembled as follows: First, nickle foam (NF) was washed with deionized water and ethanol for 30 min under ultrasonic to remove the impurity on the surface. Then, 5 μL homogeneous ink of the catalyst was dropcasted on the NF. The electrochemical cell was carried out with the electrocatalyst-modified NF in O2-saturated 1.0 M KOH at 3V. All electrochemical measurements were carried out at room temperature.

**DFT Calculations.** DFT calculations were performed by using the Vienna Ab-initio Simulation Package (VASP). The interactions between ion cores and valence electrons were described by the Blöchl's allelectron-like projector augmented wave (PAW) method. The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional was adopted for the exchange-correlation interaction. The electron occupancies were determined according to the Fermi scheme with the energy smearing of 0.1 eV. The electron wave functions were expanded using the plane waves with a cutoff energy of 400 eV. The geometries were optimized until the energy and the force were converged to 1.0×10−5 eV/atom and 0.01 eV/Å, respectively. The Brillouin zone integration was approximated by a sum over special selected kpoint grid in reciprocal space using the 3×3×1 Monkhorst–Pack method during the geometry optimization. A semiempirical DFT-D2 force-field approach was employed to consider the influence of van der Waals (vdW) interaction in our calculations. Besides, the (111) surface of Ni1.5Co1.5N and PF/Ni1.5Co1.5N were chosen in our model. The thickness of the surface slab was chosen to be a four-layer slab. During the geometry optimizations, the positions of the atoms in the two bottom layers were fixed in their bulk positions, while the two top layers were allowed to relax. A vacuum layer as large as 15 Å between repeated slabs was used along the c direction normal to the catalyst surface to avoid periodic interactions. Gibbs free energy changes for OER steps:

\* + 
$$OH^- \rightarrow *OH + e^-$$
 (1)

\*OH + OH
$$^- \rightarrow$$
\*O + H<sub>2</sub>O + e $^-$  (2)

$$^{*}O + OH^{-} \rightarrow ^{*}OOH + e^{-}$$
 (3)

\*OOH + OH
$$^- \rightarrow ^*O_2 + H_2O + e^-$$
 (4)

$$^*O_2 \rightarrow ^* + O_2 \text{ (gas form)}$$
 (5)

The change of Gibbs free energy (ΔGi) for OER steps (1 and 3) was calculated by:

$$\Delta G_i = \Delta E_i + \Delta ZPE_i - T\Delta S_i - \Delta G_{pH} + 1/2 G_{H2} - G_{H2O} - eU$$

The change of Gibbs free energy (ΔGi) for OER steps (2 and 4) was calculated by:

$$\Delta G_i = \Delta E_i + \Delta ZPE_i - T\Delta S_i - \Delta G_{pH} + 1/2 G_{H2} - eU$$

The change of Gibbs free energy (ΔGi) for OER steps (5) was calculated by:

$$\Delta G_i = \Delta E_i + \Delta Z P E_i - T \Delta S_i + G_{O2}$$

The reaction energy (ΔE) is obtained by calculating the DFT total energies. The harmonic vibrational frequency calculations were performed to determine the zero point energy (ΔZPE). ΔS is the change in entropy and T is room temperature (298.15 K). e is the transferred electron. *U* is the electrode potential with respect to the standard hydrogen electrode (defined at pH=0), and it is converted to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) by subtracting kT×pH×ln10, the value of pH was assumed to be 14 in this work. Gas phase H2O at 0.035 bar is used as the reference state, where the gas phase H2O is in equilibrium with the liquid H2O at 298.15 K. The free energy of (e<sup>−</sup>−OH<sup>−</sup> ) was computed assuming e<sup>−</sup>−OH<sup>−</sup>=1/2 GH2−GH2O–eU, where GH2 and GH2O are the free energy of H<sup>2</sup> and H2O molecule. The free energy of O<sup>2</sup> (g) is obtained according to the free energy change of the reaction FULL PAPER WILEY-VCH

 $G_{02}$ = $2G_{H20}$ - $2G_{H2}$ +4.92. The entropies of the free molecules (such as  $H_2$  and  $H_2$ O) are taken from the NIST database, while the entropies of the other OER intermediates are calculated from the vibrational frequencies.

**Calculation Method.** The calculation of TOF, specific activity, and mass activity are shown as follows:

Specific activity = j / (10SBETM)

Mass activity = i/m

TOF = iS / (4Fn)

The specific activity (Ma cm $^{-2}$ ) are calculated through the BET surface area S<sub>BET</sub> (m $^2$  g $^{-1}$ ), the loading density of the catalyst m (0.25 mg cm $^{-2}$ ), and the current density j (Ma cm $^{-2}$ ) at  $\eta$ =0.35 V;

The mass activity (A g¹) are calculated through the loading density m (0.25 mg cm²) and the current density j (mA cm²) at  $\eta$ =0.35 V; The TOF are calculated by assuming that Ni and Co ions are all active and promote to the OER (lowest TOF values were calculated). j (mA cm²) is the measured current density at  $\eta$ =0.35 V; S (0.0707 cm²) is the surface area of glassy carbon electrode; the number of 4 means four electrons per O₂ molecular; F is Faraday constant (96485.3 C mol¹), and n is the molar number of the metal ions calculated from loading density.

### FULL PAPER

A facile strategy to phosphorus and fluorine doped Ni1.5Co1.5N hybrid nanorods catalyst was reported for the first time. Benefitting from advantages of surface heteroatoms doping and double nitridation, it manifests a low overpotential of 280 mV at 10 mA cm-, Tafel slope of 66.1 mV dec-1 , and excellent durability in 1.0 M KOH solution. It confirms that heteroatoms doping could serve as a new class of OER catalysts with excellent catalytic activity.

**Abstract:** Heterogeneous dual-site electrocatalysts are emerging cutting-edge materials for efficient electrochemical water splitting. However, the corresponding oxygen evolution reaction (OER) mechanism on these materials is still unclear. Herein, based on a series of in situ spectroscopy experiments and density function theory (DFT) calculations, a new heterogeneous dualsite O O bridging mechanism (DSBM) is proposed. This mechanism is to elucidate the sequential appearance of dual active sites through in situ construction (hybrid ions undergo reconstruction initially), determine the crucial role of hybrid dual sites in this mechanism (with Ni sites preferentially adsorbing hydroxyls for catalysis followed by proton removal at Fe sites), assess the impact of O O bond formation on the activation state of water (inducing orderliness of activated water), and investigate the universality (with Co doping in Ni(P4O11)). Under the guidance of this mechanism, with Fe Ni(P4O11) as pre-catalyst, the in situ formed Fe Ni(OH)2 electrocatalyst has reached a record-low overpotential of 156.4 mV at current density of 18.0 mAcm <sup>2</sup> . Successfully constructed Fe Ni(P4O11)/Ti uplifting the overall efficacy of the phosphate from moderate to superior, positioning it as an innovative and highly proficient electrocatalyst for OER.

issues. While, the energy conversion efficiency is constrained by sluggish kinetics of anodic Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER), which involves multi-proton-coupled electron transfer pathways and rigid O O bonds formation.[1] The anode materials for water electrolysis are predominantly focused on scarce and expensive iridium or ruthenium-based oxides.[2] There is an urgent desire to develop effective OER electrocatalysts with earth-abundant elements. Transition metals based "cheap" electrocatalytic materials are one of the most promising components for electrochemical OER,[3] which is generally believed to in situ construct intermediates as active species to accelerate reaction kinetics.[4] However, up to now, the following fundamental mechanisms regarding active species of transition metals based electrocatalysts remain unclearly: (1) What's the real source of catalytic activity in electrocatalysts? (2) What mechanisms do the active sources follow?

To address the aforementioned questions, researchers have suggested three mainstream mechanisms of adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM),[5] lattice oxygen mediation mechanism (LOM),[6] and \*O \*O coupling mechanism (OCM),[7] based on numerous outstanding developments of single-metal OER electrocatalysts, however, which materials still face severe drawbacks of high energy barriers and narrow space for modulation, and thus limit their further improvements of catalytic performances.[8] In this situation, the design of dual-site catalysts has emerged as a promising research direction to achieve higher OER activity. Examples of Au@Ni3FeOx, [9] NiFe SAC[10] and Fe Co DSC[11] have showcased significant advancements in catalytic performance (~η=270.0 mV vs. RHE @10.0 mAcm <sup>2</sup> ). Unfortunately, research on dual-active-site catalysts is still in its early stages. Moreover, many fundamental key issues remain unresolved, such as the sequence of in situ construction of dual-active sites, the crucial role of hybrid dual sites in this mechanism, the impact of O O bond formation on water activation state, and the universality of the dual-site mechanism.

Herein, through a series of in situ spectroscopic characterizations and DFT calculations on dual-site electrocatalyst, we attempt to propose a new electrocatalytic OER mechanism of DSBM. DFT calculations indicate that, considering the solvent effect, using Fe-doped Ni(OH)2 as a model follows the dual-site catalysis mechanism (DSBM). The metal (Ni) with a higher atomic percentage in Fe Ni(OH)2 preferentially adsorbed hydroxy for catalysis. Subsequently, the metal (Fe) with a lower percentage was introduced for deprotonation, leading to the formation of heterogeneous Ni O O Fe bridging structure, which regulated the OER pathways under DSBM. The dual-site OER electrocatalyst of Fe-doped Ni(OH)2 is in situ constructed with Fe Ni(P4O11) as precatalyst. The constructed Fe/Ni dual-site electrocatalyst just need an overpotential of 156.4 mV vs. RHE to reach a current density of 18.0 mAcm <sup>2</sup> , which value is exceptionally record-low for electrochemical OER. Excitingly, combining extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), in situ Raman spectroscopy analysis and Rapid-scan FT-IR monitoring using the attenuated total reflection (ATR) (FT-IR), we have revealed the crucial role of the in situ reconstructed intermediate (Fe-doped Ni(OH)2) to form top Ni O O Fe structure and thus to modulate the OER mechanism. We have identified the formation of the active intermediate at 960 cm <sup>1</sup> (FT-IR) via an O O stretching mode. In Fe Ni(P4O11), the heteroatoms are preferentially restructured, and for the first time, the role of the O O bond in facilitating ordered water activation is explored. This promotes the contact between the active sites and activated water, thereby effectively enhancing performance. As an innovative genre of doped pre-catalyst (Fe Ni(P4O11)/Ti), comprehending the modus operandi of reconstructing highly active doped intermediates and elucidating their underlying mechanism furnish corresponding theoretical steerage for the design of superior OER catalysts.

### *Results and Discussion*

#### *DFT Calculations*

DFT calculations were performed to elucidate the OER mechanisms on constructed Fe/Ni dual-site electrocatalysts. Both the models of Ni(OH)2 and Fe-doped Ni(OH)2 (Figure S1) were employed to unveil the potentially synergistic mechanism of Ni and Fe as dual sites. The previously suggested mechanisms of AEM, LOM (Figure S2), OCM and proposed mechanism of DSBM (Figure 1a) were all illustrated to reveal processes of OER on single-site,[12] homogeneous dual-site, and heterogeneous dual-site catalysts, respectively.

In the AEM process,[12a] the four-electron transfer mechanism for the catalytic oxidation of hydroxyl ions (OH ) at a singular active site, either iron (Fe) or nickel (Ni), proceeds through the following sequence: the AEM pathway emphasizes the reactivity of peripheral metal cations, encompassing four-electron transfer epochs that are intimately linked to the adsorptive affinity of intermediate moieties (Figure S2a). This description ensures a precise and academically robust explanation of the AEM process concerning the catalytic oxidation dynamics at specified metallic centers:

$$* + OH^{-} = *OH + e^{-}$$
 (R1)

$$*OH + OH^{-} = *O + H_2O + e^{-}$$
 (R2)

$$*O + OH^{-} = *OOH + e^{-}$$
 (R3)

$$*OOH + OH^{-} = * +O_2 + H_2O + e^{-}$$
 (R4)

When Ni served as active site in Ni(OH)2 or Fe Ni(OH)2, the rate-determining step was the oxidation of \*OH to \*O· (R2) with energy barriers of 0.94 eV and 0.90 eV respectively (Figure 1b and Figure S3 and S4I). When Fe served as the active site in Fe Ni(OH)2, the ratedetermining step transitioned to the step of oxidizing \*OH to \*OOH (R3), with an energy barrier of 0.49 eV (Figure S4II). Therefore, the Fe active site leads to a change of rate-determining step with a significant reduction in energy barrier, which was advantageous for efficient OER catalysis.[12b]

In contrast to the AEM mechanism, the LOM emphasizes the creation of oxygen vacancies on the catalyst surface following the evolution of surface oxygen species.[12c] These vacancies are subsequently filled either by hydroxide ions from the electrolyte or through the diffusion of oxygen from the bulk to the surface (Figure S2b). Intense interactions between the surface metal cations of the catalyst and the electrolyte foster a surface restructuring of the catalyst, thereby enhancing reaction kinetics.[12d,e] In the case of LOM, the four-electron transfer process for the catalytic oxidation of OH at a singular site (Fe or Ni) proceeds as follows:[12c]

$$V_O + OH^- = *OH + e^-$$
 (R5)

$$*OH + OH^{-} = *O + H_{2}O + e^{-}$$
 (R6)

$$*O + 2OH^{-} = *O - O + H_2O + e^{-}$$
 (R7)

$$*O-O=O_2 + V_O + e^-$$
 (R8)

*Angewandte*

When oxygen vacancy (Vo) served as active site in Fe Ni(OH)2, the rate-determining step involved the oxidation of \*O O to Vo (R8) with energy barriers of 3.98 eV (Figure 1b). The significantly increased energy barrier was adverse for efficient OER catalysis.[12c]

Existing literatures indicate that catalysts,[12] which have dopant atoms adsorbed onto vacant sites beyond the stable outer oxygen layer, are beneficial for the AEM mechanism. Conversely, catalysts with dopant atoms replaced in the subsurface metal layer are more suitable for the LOM. Since a single-site based mechanism cannot offer theoretical guidance for engineering more complex electrocatalysts with enhanced OER performances, we introduce the fourelectron transfer process of OCM based on a homogeneous dual-site approach as described below:[12f]

*\** � � � �*\** þ OH ¼*\** � � � �*\** OH þ e (R9)

*\** � � � �*\**OH þ OH ¼ HO*\** � � � �*\**OH þ e (R10)

$$HO^* \cdots *OH + OH^- = HO^* \cdots *O + H_2O + e^-$$
 (R11)

$$HO^* \cdots ^*O + OH^- = ^* \cdots ^* + O_2 + H_2O + e^-$$
 (R12)

With dual-site Ni as catalytic active site, the ratedetermining step involved the deprotonation process (R11), which required to overcome an energy barrier of 0.81 eV (Figure 1b and S5).

For dual-site OER mechanism based on heterogeneous metals, four possible dual-site cooperative pathways were considered in Fe Ni(OH)2 (Figure S6). The optimal reaction pathway involved the sequential adsorption and oxidation of OH on Ni and Fe respectively to generate heterogeneous Ni O O Fe structure. Subsequently, the intermediate species were stepwisely oxidized and ultimately produced oxygen (Figure 1a). The rate-limiting step in this pathway was the oxidation of OH on Ni. Compared to the energy barrier of 0.51 eV that needed to be overcome in the single-site catalytic pathway, the energy barrier in this pathway was reduced to 0.13 eV (Figure 1b and 1c). This indicated that the Fe and Ni bimetallic synergistic catalytic pathway greatly facilitated electron transfer, thereby accelerated the kinetics of OER reaction. Therefore, we proposed that the metal (Ni) with a higher atomic percentage in Fe Ni(OH)2 preferentially adsorbed hydroxy for catalysis. Subsequently, the metal (Fe) with a lower percentage was introduced for deprotonation, leading to the formation of heterogeneous Ni O O Fe bridging structure, which regulated the OER pathways under DSBM mechanism.

### *Synthesis and Structural Characterization of Fe Ni(P4O11)/Ti*

Modulating the ratio of NiCl2 · 6H2O to FeSO4 ·7H2O can effectively alter the morphology of intermediates (Figure S7): under consistent conditions, when solely NiCl2 · 6H2O (1.0 mmol) is employed, micrometer flowers assembled from sheet-like structures are generated (Figure S7a). When the ratio is adjusted to 9: 1, solid spheres assembled from sheet-like structures on the exterior come into formation (Figure S7b). Further varying the ratio (8 : 2) amplifies the dimensions of the external sheet-like structures (Figure S7c). As the ratio escalates to 7 :3, a profound structural transformation transpires, yielding intermediates with bifurcated morphologies: micrometer spheres boasting augmented external sheet-like structures and micrometer constructs assembled from nanoplates (Figure S7d and 7e). With an additional increase in ratio (6 :4), a conspicuous shift in the emergent structure occurs, presenting solely micrometer constructs assembled from nanoplates (Figure S7f). Persistently elevating the ratio fails to realize in situ growth on Ti foil. The fabrication of diverse morphologies might be contingent upon the quantity of Fe integrating into the lattice. The etching by F ions and the modulation of solution pH by urea and NH4 <sup>+</sup> ions foster the emergence of precursor structures with varied morphologies, thereby furnishing prospects for the emergence of novel nanostructured materials.[13]

The Fe-doped Ni(P4O11) was utilized as pre-electrocatalyst for in situ generation of Fe-doped Ni(OH)2. As shown in Figure 2a, the Fe-doped Ni(P4O11) was fabricated in a thermal phosphorization method with hydrothermally synthesized Ni2(CO3)(OH)2 Ni(OH)2 · 7H2O/Ti microsphere as precursor (Figure S8). The atomic Ni/Fe ratios have been optimized through estimating their electrocatalytic OER

performance (Figure S9). The XRD analysis (X-Ray Diffraction, Figure 2b) was accomplished to reveal the crystal structure, and the doping of Fe induced slight shift of diffraction peaks to the reference values of Ni(P4O11) (JCPDS: 83-0601) (Figure S10).[14] After applying the Fe Ni(P4O11)/Ti sample via scrap-coating, we performed XRD analysis at a reduced scanning rate. The primary peak aligned with the standard reference for Ni(P4O11).

When diverse gas flow rates are implemented (Figure 2c and Figure S11) the intermediate undergoes varying degrees of mass decrement. At a gas flow rate of 100 sccm N2, the intermediate experiences an approximate 30% mass decrement at 400 °C. This phenomenon is attributed to the slow decomposition of CO3 <sup>2</sup> or OH , hindering PH3 from fully substituting them and subsequently forming the composite nano-material Ni(P4O11) (Figure 2b and Figure 2c). As the gas flow rate escalates to 300 sccm N2, the mass decrement of the intermediate attains 60% at 400 °C.[15] The accelerated mass decrement suggests the rapid decomposition of CO3 or OH . During extended thermal phosphorization, PH3 penetrates the crystal structure, thoroughly replacing CO3 2 or OH , culminating in the emergence of the Ni5P4 structure (Figure 2c and Figure S11a).

Additionally, thermal flux signifies the quantity of heat traversing the surface of an object within a unit of time.[16] Under an elevated gas flow rate, the intermediate manifests pronounced endothermic behavior. As the temperature ascends, PH3 can sufficiently interface with the vacancies engendered by the decomposition of CO3 <sup>2</sup> or OH , culminating in the emergence of the Ni5P4 structure. At diminished gas flow rates, the intermediate demonstrates a lesser degree of temperature dependency and ingests heat at a reduced pace. This attenuated absorption of heat results in an incomplete phosphorization of the intermediate during thermal processing, consequently giving rise to the composite nano-material Ni(P4O11) (Figure S11b). To further substantiate the decomposition of CO3 <sup>2</sup> or OH ions, we conducted thermogravimetric-infrared spectroscopy (TG-IR) analyses (Figure 2d). It is discernible that within the confines of 400 °C, notable alterations in CO3 <sup>2</sup> ions and the genesis of CO2 are perceptible. Conversely, no significant modulations in hydroxide ions or H2O were discerned. This substantiates that under the N2 atmosphere, the decomposition of CO3 <sup>2</sup> ions in the intermediate facilitates the ingress of PH3 into the crystalline matrix, thereby actualizing the genesis of the novel Fe Ni(P4O11) material.[17]

The micro-morphology of Fe Ni(P4O11) displayed microsphere structure with flower-like nanosheet composition (Figure 2e), which homogeneous microsphere structures were well inherited from its precursor of Ni2(CO3)(OH)2 Ni(OH)2 · 7H2O/Ti (Figure S8 and Figure S12). To further elucidate the structures of Fe Ni(P4O11), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analyses were conducted. The furry microsphere structure of Fe Ni(P4O11) was as well as displayed (Figure 2f), and closer observation further confirmed its nanosheet composition (Figure 2g), which was consistent with the morphology that a material of this chemical structure should present (inset in Figure 2e).

Furthermore, the spacing between lattice fringes in the HRTEM (High Resolution Transmission Electron Microscope) images corresponded to (032), ( 221) and ( 122) planes of the monoclinic crystal system of Ni(P4O11) with spacings of 0.240, 0.301 and 0.314 nm, respectively (Figure 2h). Notably, the incorporation of Fe dopants induced a discernible shift in the XRD peak angles (Figure 1b), leading to a marked contraction in the lattice parameters, as dictated by the Bragg equation.[14] Specifically, the ( 122) lattice plane shrank from 0.316 nm to 0.314 nm (Figure 2h). Utilizing the correlation between angle and lattice parameters inherent to the monoclinic system, the theoretical angle between the ( 122) and ( 221) planes was determined to be 54.7°. The observed reduction in d-spacing consequently resulted in a notable diminishment of this angle, with empirical measurements registering at 52.0°. This outcome further substantiates the successful synthesis of Ni(P4O11) and verifies the incorporation of Fe dopants (Figure 2h).

Scanning electron microscopy energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) analysis confirmed the successful doping of Fe and homogeneous distribution of all elements including Fe, Ni, O and P in the Fe Ni(P4O11) microsphere (Figure 2i). In addition, to quantitatively analyze the ratio of Ni to Fe in Fe Ni(P4O11), inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) analysis was conducted and revealed a Ni:Fe ratio of approximately 33 :1 (Table S1), which further confirmed the successful doping of Fe. Its ratio was much lower than the raw material ratio. The possible reason for this was that an excess of Fe source was required during the synthesis of the precursor to facilitate the introduction of a small amount of Fe into the precursor, ultimately leading to the formation of Fe-doped Ni(P4O11).

#### *Electrocatalytic OER Measurements*

Previous literature has reported numerous dual-metal catalysts applied in the OER catalytic reaction, achieving impressive catalytic performances. Examples include 3D-a-NiFeOOH/N-CFP (10.0 mAcm 2@170.0 mV),[18a] Ni/Fe-MOF (10.0 mAcm <sup>2</sup> @220.0 mV),[18b] CCF-1 (10.0 mAcm 2@210.0 mV),[18c] Fe3Co(PO4)4 (10.0 mAcm 2@237.0 mV),[18d] and others.[18e] However, the catalytic performance of Ni Fe-based phosphates has consistently remained at a moderate level (refer to Table S2), without achieving significant breakthroughs. We anticipate that the Ni Fe-based phosphate catalyst we designed can achieve a remarkable performance breakthrough (18.0 mAcm 2@η*<*170.0 mV).

The electrochemical OER activity of Ni2P4O12/Ti, Fe Ni(P4O11)/Ti, and RuO2/carbon cloth (CC) were estimated from Linear Sweep Voltammetry (LSV) polarization curves. Importantly, before electrocatalytic activity evaluation, an in situ electrochemical activation process was first conducted (Figure S13).[8a] At an activation voltage of 1.2 V, although there was an observed increase in catalytic activity, there was no significant change in the current response (Figure S13a). This lack of change is attributed to the activation voltage being below the theoretical threshold for

Angewandte

water decomposition, which is 1.23 V. Consequently, the OER catalysis was not effectively initiated. Upon incrementing the activation voltage, a more pronounced catalytic activity was observed when the voltage was raised to 1.3 V over a period of 15.0 hours, matching the activity observed at 1.2 V after 20.0 hours (Figure S13b). At this elevated activation voltage, which exceeds the 1.23 V threshold, a notable increase in current density was recorded. This increase correlates with the process of surface reconstruction, indicative of the catalyst's enhanced OER performance.

To achieve standard current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, Fe-Ni(P<sub>4</sub>O<sub>11</sub>)/Ti only needed a record-low overpotential of 156.4 mV, which value was much smaller than that of Ni<sub>2</sub>P<sub>4</sub>O<sub>12</sub>/Ti (303.0 mV), and reference material of RuO<sub>2</sub>/CC (301.7 mV) (Figure 3a). In addition, the overpotential values to achieve current densities of 10.0, 50.0, and 100.0 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> were summarized in Figure 3b. At all current densities, the Fe-Ni(P<sub>4</sub>O<sub>11</sub>)/Ti presented the best electrocatalytic OER activity.

In linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), oxidation peaks are often observed. These peaks indicate that under external voltage, metals preferentially lose electrons and undergo oxidation. The electrons lost are transferred to the external circuit and captured by cathodic materials where reduction reactions occur. At this stage, metal ions are in an electrondeficient state, promoting nucleophilic attack of water or OH- in the electrolyte, leading to water oxidation. [19] In Linear Sweep Voltammetry (LSV), the appearance of oxidation peaks is a common phenomenon. These peaks

signify those metals, under an applied external voltage, tend to lose electrons, undergoing oxidation. The electrons lost are then conveyed through the external circuit to the cathodic materials, where they participate in reduction reactions. Concurrently, metal ions, now in an electrondeficient state, become more susceptible to nucleophilic attacks by water or OH- in the electrolyte, initiating the water oxidation process. [19b] In Figure S14a and Figure S14b, the yellow area represents the metal oxidation area, while the orange area represents the water oxidation area. We selected the voltage and current density at the initial position of the water oxidation area to achieve a more accurate overpotential (18.0 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> @156.4 mV). To avoid interference from the characteristics of catalyst oxidation, the cathodic sweep curves (reverse scans) of three different catalysts are used for quantitative comparison in Figure S14c.<sup>[20]</sup> Among them, Fe-Ni(P<sub>4</sub>O<sub>11</sub>)/Ti provides a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> at a very low overpotential of 172.5 mV, which is significantly lower than the current densities reported for most non-precious metal catalysts (Table S2 and S3).

Furthermore, the Tafel curves were presented in Figure 3c, where the slope values can effectively indicate catalytic reaction kinetics. Smaller value of Tafel slope reveals faster current density increases and faster catalytic reaction kinetics. The Tafel slope of Fe-Ni(P<sub>4</sub>O<sub>11</sub>)/Ti was calculated to be 42.8 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>, much less than RuO<sub>2</sub>/CC  $(55.8 \text{ mV dec}^{-1})$  and  $Ni_2P_4O_{12}/Ti$   $(80.2 \text{ mV dec}^{-1})$ , which clearly indicated faster catalytic rate on Fe-Ni(P<sub>4</sub>O<sub>11</sub>)/Ti. Noteworthily, the turnover frequency (TOF) values on Fe-Ni(P<sub>4</sub>O<sub>11</sub>) and reference catalyst of RuO<sub>2</sub> were calculated and presented in Figure 3d. Significantly enhanced turnover frequency value can be elucidated across the entire applied overpotential range (100-300 mV).<sup>[21]</sup> For example, at overpotential of 200.0 mV, the Fe-Ni(P<sub>4</sub>O<sub>11</sub>) catalyst achieved a TOF value of 0.08 s<sup>-1</sup>, which was eight times higher than that of RuO<sub>2</sub> (0.010 s<sup>-1</sup>). Therefore, the Fe-Ni(P<sub>4</sub>O<sub>11</sub>) presented an excellent electrocatalytic OER activity.

We have as well as characterized the interfacial charge transfer on Fe-Ni(P<sub>4</sub>O<sub>11</sub>)/Ti and RuO<sub>2</sub>/CC in OER process by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) (Figure 3e) and fitted the data with a circuit model. The inset in Figure 3e showed the equivalent circuit with three elements of solution resistance  $(R_s)$ , constant phase element (CPE), and charge transfer resistance (R<sub>ct</sub>). Though the RuO<sub>2</sub> showed a smaller  $R_{ct}$  value of 3.46  $\Omega$  than Fe-Ni(P<sub>4</sub>O<sub>11</sub>) of 6.64  $\Omega$ , the Fe–Ni(P<sub>4</sub>O<sub>11</sub>)/Ti electrode still presented smaller circular radius than RuO<sub>2</sub>/CC, which indicated fast kinetic process in the OER catalytic process.

The catalyst's surface is markedly rough and polycrystalline, which is conventionally associated with suboptimal electrochemical stability. Nevertheless, in our preceding studies, we ascertained that this coarse, polycrystalline surface morphology also manifests exceptional catalytic stability, particularly in samples that have undergone I-T activation. [8a] Here, the restructured hydroxide demonstrates remarkable catalytic resilience. The electrochemical stability of Fe-Ni(P<sub>4</sub>O<sub>11</sub>)/Ti catalyst was evaluated by accelerated 15213757, 2024, 46, Downloaded from https://onlinelbrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/age,202411683 by University Of Science, Wiley Online Library on [07/0/1/2026].

durability test (ADT) between 1.0 and 1.8 V (vs RHE) in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte at scan rate of 100 mVs 1 . Clearly, after 1000-cycle LSV durability test, the current density kept almost constant (Figure S14d), indicating an excellent cycling performance. In addition, the time dependence stability measurement was performed with chronoamperometry test at constant potential of 1.406 and 1.482 V on Fe Ni(P4O11)/Ti. As shown in Figure 3f, only 2.0 and 5.6% decrease of current density can be measured after running over 100.0 h (Figure 3f). The current decline can be mainly ascribed to catalyst collapse due to the mechanical force of generated oxygen bubbles.[22] Thus, Fe Ni(P4O11)/Ti exhibited good long-term stability for OER.

To further ascertain the durability of the engineered Fe Ni(P4O11)/Ti post-activation, we conducted meticulous XRD assessments at a reduced scanning rate (0.1°/min over 600 minutes) on the activated specimens (Figure S15a). Distinct peaks indicative of Ni(OH)2 were readily apparent, suggesting the in situ generation of Ni(OH)2. Owing to the Fe doping and the influence of Fe Ni(P4O11), there was a notable shift in the angular positions of the corresponding XRD peaks. Utilizing the Bragg equation, this angular increment translates to a perceptible reduction in lattice parameters. Specifically, the lattice plane indexed as (011) contracted from 0.2339 nm to 0.233 nm. This phenomenon aligns with the observed shift in XRD peak locations, further substantiating the in situ formation of Fe-doped Ni(OH)2. Proximate to the Fe Ni(OH)2 domain, the structural characteristics of Fe Ni(P4O11) are unambiguously discernible. Drawing upon the angular and lattice parameter relationships inherent to the monoclinic crystalline framework, the theoretical angle between the ( 312) and ( 202) planes is computed to be 60.0°. The diminishment in dspacing precipitates a significant decrement in this angle, with empirical measurements registering at 57.0°, thereby further corroborating the successful synthesis of Fe Ni(OH)2 (Figure S15b).

To deepen our understanding of the correlation between structural attributes and stability (Figure S16), we subjected the activated samples to an extended 100.0-hour test at 1.48 V. Throughout this period, the current density remained largely unchanged (Figure S16a). XRD analysis post-testing revealed no significant modifications in the crystal structure, underscoring its exceptional stability (Figure S16b). HRTEM examinations identified crystal planes consistent with Fe Ni(OH)2 and Fe Ni(P4O11) configurations, reaffirming the resilience of the reconstructed architecture (Figure S16c). In anticipation of potential electrolyte depletion during prolonged catalysis, a melt-pump device was incorporated to ensure the electrolyte composition was maintained consistently throughout the catalytic reactions (Figure S16d). Following the stability assessments, Linear Sweep Voltammetry evaluations indicated no apparent degradation in performance metrics (Figure S16e). Moreover, SEM characterization of the samples post-stability testing demonstrated no substantial alterations in structural integrity, further attesting to their remarkable mechanical robustness (Figure S16f and 16 g).

To further demonstrate the exceptional stability of the catalyst in the context of the OER, we conducted rigorous stability tests. These tests were performed at an applied potential of 1.70 V, with a current density maintained at 500.0 mAcm <sup>2</sup> . Over the course of 85.0 hours, the current density remained remarkably consistent, as depicted in Figure S17. This sustained performance is a testament to the catalyst's robustness. Furthermore, LSV curves obtained both prior to and subsequent to the stability test corroborate the catalyst's enduring stability. The consistency between these curves provides compelling evidence of the catalyst's resistance to degradation under OER conditions.

The electrocatalytic OER activity of Fe Ni(P4O11)/Ti with previously reported electrocatalysts were summarized and presented in Figure 3g (See Table S2 and S3). Even without considering the corrections of iR-compensation (i, current; R, resistance), the Fe Ni(P4O11)/Ti still outperformed the previously reported OER catalysts with a record-low overpotential (Table S2 and S3). All of the above electrochemical data clearly presented that Fe Ni(P4O11)/Ti exhibited superior electrochemical OER activity over the other as-synthesized catalysts.

#### *OER Mechanism*

To deeper understand the intrinsic OER mechanism after the activation process on Fe Ni(P4O11), a series of characteristic experiment were performed to elucidate proposed DSBM through formation of heterogeneous Ni O O Fe intermediates. *Operando* electrochemical Raman spectroscopy can effectively detect active intermediates during the OER process on the surface of Fe Ni(P4O11) (Figure 4). Indeed, the electrostatic adsorption of impurities or reactants can influence Raman activity. To circumvent these interferences, we fine-tuned the Raman test parameters (325 nm to 532 nm, ND filter 25% (23 mW), Acq time (60 s), Accumulation (10)) and employed an in situ Raman electrolysis cell (Figure S18).

Firstly, we conducted in situ electrochemical surface enhancement of Raman scattering measurements (SERS) on undoped Ni2P4O12/Ti to monitor the OER process on the surface of Ni2P4O12 (Figure 4a). The test data recorded Raman spectra from 1.1 V to 1.6 V. No significant peaks were observed at potentials of 1.1 V and 1.2 V vs. RHE. Upon increasing the potential to 1.3 V, Raman bands near 444.1 and 510.8 cm <sup>1</sup> , corresponding to the peaks of NiOOH,[23] were observed. Upon returning the potential to 1.1 V, the relative intensities of the 444.1 and 510.8 cm <sup>1</sup> bands significantly decreased, demonstrating the irreversible and stable existence of NiOOH.

It's worth noting that in situ electrochemical enhanced Raman spectroscopy was employed to capture signals corresponding to H2O, allowing for an analysis of the impact of catalytic intermediate species on the activity of water. Gaussian fitting of the spectra revealed that the O H stretching bands could be categorized into three types of stretching vibrations: 4-coordinated hydrogen-bonded water (4-HB·H2O), water within 2-coordinated hydrogen bonds

During the OER catalysis, significant fluctuations of interfacial water (4-HB·H<sub>2</sub>O and 2-HB·H<sub>2</sub>O) were observed, leading to an increase in the disorder of activated water (Figure 4b and 4c).[25]

Subsequently, we conducted in situ electrochemical surface enhancement of Raman scattering measurements on doped Fe-Ni(P<sub>4</sub>O<sub>11</sub>)/Ti to track the OER process on the surface of the doped material (Figure 4d). First, the Raman spectrum was collected at 0.0 V. The peak at 471.8 cm<sup>-1</sup> can be attributed to Fe-O in the stretching mode, demonstrating the successful doping of Fe into Ni(P<sub>4</sub>O<sub>11</sub>).<sup>[26]</sup> As increasing the potential to 1.1 V, there was no significant change in Fe-O bond strength. When the potential was further increased to 1.1 V, a peak at 290.8 cm<sup>-1</sup> emerged, which can be attributed to stretching mode of the Fe-O bond (γ-FeOOH). [27] and demonstrated that Fe. as a dopant, was preferentially undergoing restructuration. As the potential reached to be 1.2 V, both the stretching modes of Fe-O (α-FeOOH)<sup>[26]</sup> and Ni–O (β-Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>)<sup>[28]</sup> bonds significantly enhanced at 290.8 and 443.8 cm<sup>-1</sup> respectively. As the potential reached to be 1.3 V, both the stretching modes of Fe-O and Ni-O bonds significantly enhanced, respectively. In addition, new peaks appeared at 1151.1 cm<sup>-1</sup>, which can be attributed to the formation of Ni-O-O-Fe bond respectively, and the bridging -O-O- mode potentially acted as active reaction intermediate. As shown in Figure 4d. the position of Ni-O-O-Fe typically appearing around 1150 cm<sup>-1</sup> in the Raman spectrum confirms that NiFe follows an OER dual-active site catalysis. [9] Additionally, as the test voltage continues to increase, the intensities of Ni-O, Fe-O, and Ni-O-O-Fe consistently rise. When the voltage decreases from 1.6 V to 1.1 V, their intensities rapidly diminish, but peaks remain clearly visible. This suggests that the catalytic reactions involving Ni-O, Fe-O, and Ni-O-O-Fe bonds formed during OER activation are associated with these chemical bonds. It is noteworthy that the formation of NiOOH, compared to undoped materials, contributes to an increase in the disorder of activated water. Conversely, the formation of Ni-O-O-Fe may enhance the orderliness of activated water, which is beneficial for facilitating effective contact between active sites and activated water in catalysis (Figure 4e and 4f). [29]

To find direct evidence for the key non-uniform bimetallic O-O bridging mechanism, we employed timeresolved rapid-scan ATR FT-IR spectroscopy to measure the intermediates of O-O bond formation. [30] Under various isotopic labeling experimental conditions, we collected 10.0 s photosensitized spectra. The static spectra showed peaks at 754, 1100, 1400, and 1610 cm<sup>-1</sup>, which correspond to C-H, C-N, C-H (bending vibrations), and CH<sub>3</sub>CN respectively. Weak peaks in the 1300-1000 cm<sup>-1</sup> region can be attributed to spectra of peroxysulfate and sulfate species (Figure S19).[30a,b] Isotopic labeling resulted in noticeable peak shifts (C-N and CH<sub>3</sub>CN) and changes in intensity (C-H), consistent with reports in the literature. [30a]

In the time-resolved rapid-scan ATR FT-IR spectroscopy tests on Fe-Ni(P<sub>4</sub>O<sub>11</sub>), Trace 1 displayed no significant peak overlap. Trace 1, under the given experimental conditions, lacked distinct peaks in the 880-980 cm<sup>-1</sup> range. However, Trace 4 exhibited a clear peak at 913 cm<sup>-1</sup>, with no corresponding deuterium shift at 960.0 cm<sup>-1</sup>, suggesting that the active intermediate is devoid of OH groups. Trace 5 introduced a new peak at 923 cm<sup>-1</sup>, correlating to half the frequency shift expected for the partially labeled <sup>18</sup>O<sup>16</sup>O intermediate. The ATR FT-IR spectroscopy outcomes, in conjunction with prior literature, support a catalytic active

intermediate structure of Ni O O Fe (Figure 4g).[30a,c,d] The O O stretching frequency for the bridged [salen)Fe OO Fe(salen)] complex is documented at 1001 cm <sup>1</sup> . [30e] The substantial isotopic frequency shift of O (57 cm <sup>1</sup> ), likely attributable to the Ni site, offers compelling experimental evidence for the non-uniform bimetallic O O bridging mechanism.

X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) was used to investigate local chemical structure around Fe and Ni centers before and after activation. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) measurements were conducted on Fe Ni(P4O11) and standard reference samples (Fe: FeO, Fe3O4, Fe2O3, and FeOOH; Ni: NiO and Ni Foil) respectively (Figure S20). Compare to initial states of Fe Ni- (P4O11), after electrochemical activation, the valence states of Fe and Ni slightly decreased (Figure S21), which results was consistent with the results of XPS analysis (Figure S22– 23). Noteworthily, as previously reported results,[31] the decrease of oxidation states of Fe and Ni after activation was advantageous for improving long-term stability of active sites during the catalytic process.

The coordination conditions of Ni and Fe were revealed through fitting the Fe K-edge and Ni K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra respectively (Figure 4g and 4 h, S24, Table S4 and S5). We performed EXAFS data analysis on Fe Ni(P4O11) samples before and after activation. In the unactivated Fe Ni(P4O11), two main peaks of Fe appear at 2.00 Å and 3.04 Å, corresponding to Fe O and Fe Fe bonds, respectively. Upon activation, the Fe O and Fe Fe bonds in the Fe Ni- (P4O11) sample remain largely unchanged. However, a new peak emerges at 3.71 Å, corresponding to a Fe O O bond that matches the Ni O O Fe structure detected in situ by Raman spectroscopy (Figure 4g and S24). Additionally, Ni in Fe Ni(P4O11) exhibits two major peaks at 2.00 Å and 3.08 Å, corresponding to Ni O and Ni Ni bonds. Upon activation, the Ni Ni bond length increases to 3.13 Å, potentially indicating the formation of Ni(OH)2. Notably, a new peak appears at 3.51 Å (Figure 4h and S24), corresponding to a Ni O Ni/Fe bond that matches the Ni O Ni/ Fe structure detected in situ by Raman spectroscopy, thereby confirming the accuracy of the in situ Raman data. These findings further support the involvement of dual active sites in catalytic reactions in the activated samples, providing direct evidence for the formation of a dual-site mechanism.

DFT calculations were also conducted to explain the formation of \*O O\*, as observed form the operando Raman spectroscopy. The energy required for the desorption of \*O O\* on Ni(OH)2 and Fe Ni(OH)2 indicated that oxygen desorption on Fe Ni(OH)2 required more energy (Figure S25). Therefore, facile generation and difficult desorption of \*O O\* on Fe Ni(OH)2 lead to intense accumulation of \*O O\* species and thus resulted in stronger \*O O\* signal in Raman spectroscopy.

Furthermore, a dissolved oxygen meter was used to measure the generated O2 concentration at different potentials. As shown in Figure S26, no significant increase of O2 concentration was detected at 1.1 and 1.2 V, indicating that O2 production was not feasible at these potentials. When the potential increased to 1.3 V, a noticeable increase in O2 concentration from 0.61 ppm to 0.92 ppm was observed, indicating a representative electrochemical OER process. Integration of operando SERS and O2 generation results, we indicated that the disappearance of Ni O O Fe and the formation of O2 occurred at the same potential, therefore, we can conclude that the Ni O O Fe sites contribute to the conversion of the O O intermediate into O2.

Although Fe Ni(OH)2 catalysts have been documented for their role in the Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER), the reasons for the elusive observation of the Dynamic Site Binding (DSBS) mechanism may include the following: (i) The catalyst may inherently follow to the DSBS mechanism.[32] However, previous research has predominantly concentrated on aspects such as highly disordered amorphous structures,[32a] the strengthening effects of local amorphization,[32b] and changes in coordination environments.[32c] These studies have not extensively explored the underlying mechanism. (ii) The literature has reported that in Fe Ni(OH)2 catalysts, elements like iron (Fe) or nickel (Ni) may undergo cation dissolution followed by redeposition,[33] which can lead to a restructuring of the catalytic layer. This dissolution and redeposition process can result in a modification of the Ni/Fe ratio,[34] potentially giving rise to distinct catalytic mechanisms even when the same material is utilized. Our previous research has demonstrated that, in stark contrast to traditional cyclic voltammetry (CV) activation techniques, our catalyst, Ni2P4O12, undergoes an I-T (current-time) activation process, especially at low voltages.[8a] This activation mechanism involves the cleavage of chemical bonds, dissolution of phosphate ions, and modulation of lattice oxygen, all without significant dissolution of cations. This characteristic sets our findings apart from prior studies. Consequently, in this work, Inductively Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission Spectrometry (ICP-AES) analysis of Fe Ni(P4O11) before and after the activation process revealed negligible variations in the Ni/Fe ratios, as detailed in Table S1 and S6. Furthermore, subsequent OER catalytic reactions conducted on the activated Fe Ni(P4O11) at 1.5 V for durations of 0, 30, and 60 minutes also showed no significant dissolution of Fe or Ni, as presented in Table S7. These gentle activation conditions ensure the successful and stable integration of Fe into Ni(OH)2, thereby enabling a more thorough investigation of the DSBS mechanism.

To further validate the dual-site mechanism, we devised a method to introduce Co into Ni(P4O11), resulting in a Co Ni(P4O11) pre-catalyst after thermal phosphidation (Figure S27a). This was then coated onto a substrate as Co Ni(P4O11)/Ti. LSV curve testing of Co Ni(P4O11)/Ti in 1.0 M KOH at a slow scanning rate (0.5 mVs 1 ) revealed that an overpotential of 281.1 mV was required to achieve a current density of 20.0 mAcm <sup>2</sup> (Figure S27b). However, post-activation, only 208.0 mV of overpotential was needed to reach the same current density, indicating a significant performance enhancement. The primary reason for this improvement is the formation of Ni O O Co structures, consistent with the guidance of the dual active site mechanism. Notably, the introduction of cationic Co initially forms

Co O bonds during activation (Figure S27c), mirroring the phenomenon observed with Fe doping, thereby providing further experimental evidence for the validity of our mechanism.

#### *Electrocatalytic Performance for Overall Water Splitting*

The electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance on Fe Ni(P4O11)/Ti has also been evaluated. The DFT calculation has first conducted with the doped Fe replaced two representative Ni sites (Figure 5a and Figure S28).[35] As shown in Figure 5b, the ΔGH of Fe occupied 1st position and Ni at 2nd position depicted an optimal value of 0.42 eV, closing to Pt ( 0.22 eV) and implying good HER performance. The electrochemical LSV curves have demonstrated that the overpotential of optimal Fe Ni(P4O11)/Ti samples at current density of 10 mAcm <sup>2</sup> was merely 40.0 mV (Figure 5c), outperformed the activity of standard commercial Pt/C (8.9 mV). In addition, a serial of control experiments has also revealed excellent HER activity of Fe Ni(P4O11)/Ti (Figure S29–34).

Given their superior catalytic efficacy for both OER and HER, we utilized them as the anode and cathode, respectively, in an H-type electrolysis cell to assess the overall water splitting performance (Figure 5d). At an

exceptionally slow scan rate of 0.5 mVs 1 , the electrolyzer required a mere 1.40 V overpotential to reach a current density of 10.0 mAcm <sup>2</sup> (Figure 5e and 5f), outperforming the benchmark catalysts Pt C//RuO2. The Nyquist plots illustrate that the charge transfer resistance (*R*ct) for Fe Ni(P4O11)/Ti//Fe Ni(OH)2 Ni(P4O11)/Ti was significantly smaller than that of Pt C//RuO2 (Figure 5g). This reduced charge transfer resistance for Fe Ni(P4O11) suggests a robust synergistic interaction between the cathode and anode, markedly enhancing the electron transfer rate. Moreover, under conditions that included the use of a peristaltic pump, we conducted durability tests on the integrated water splitting device. Following a 140.0 h stability assessment at 1.40 V, the current density experienced only a 7.0% reduction, further underscoring the remarkable stability of this material system (Figure 5h). The Fe Ni(P4O11)/Ti only required a cell voltage of 1.45 V to reach current densities of 10 mAcm <sup>2</sup> , which was better than Pt C//RuO2 and most reported bifunctional electrocatalysts (Table S8).

### *Conclusion*

In summary, we proposed new mechanistic insights into the synergistic interaction between Ni and Fe sites during the in situ reconstruction of Fe-doped Ni(OH)2 in the OER process. DFT simulations and in situ spectroscopies confirmed that the OER pathway of Fe Ni(OH)2 followed a dual-site bridging mechanism. The metal (Ni) with a higher proportion initially adsorbed OH catalytically, followed by the introduction of metal Fe in the \*OH deprotonation process. This resulted in the formation of a bridging structure Ni O O Fe during the OER process and played a crucial role in the catalysis of OER. Guided by this mechanism, we successfully developed an in situ reconstruction strategy with Fe Ni(P4O11) as pre-catalyst to form Fe Ni(OH)2. During the OER process, the initially formed Fe O facilitated the formation of Ni(OH)2 at very low potentials and fabricated the heterogeneous Ni O O Fe structure. The in situ formed Fe Ni(OH)2 electrocatalyst presented a record-low overpotential for OER of 156.4 mV at 18.0 mAcm <sup>2</sup> with good stability. In addition, with Fe Ni(OH)2 worked as anode and cathode, an excellent electrocatalyst overall water splitting performance was as well as recorded. This comprehensive insight for OER mechanism was crucial to guide the design of heterogeneous dual-site electrocatalysts and promoted electrocatalyst into a higher realm.

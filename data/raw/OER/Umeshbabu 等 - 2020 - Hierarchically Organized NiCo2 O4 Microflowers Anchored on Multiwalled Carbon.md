**Abstract:** We have fabricated hierarchical flower-like NiCo2O4 anchored on multiwalled carbon nanotubes (NiCo2O4-MCNTs) as robust bifunctional electrocatalyst towards O2 and H2 evolution reactions in a facile surfactant free hydrothermal method. The results show that hierarchical flower-like morphology of NiCo2O4-MCNTs are assembled by 1D-nanowires. The supported MCNTs are beneficial for enhanced reactive sites, efficient charge transfer and durability of the composite. The NiCo2O4-MCNTs hybrid shows low overpotentials of 350 mV and 209 mV for OER and HER, respectively at 10 mA cm-2 . Such values are comparable to contemporary noble metal catalysts and even smaller than reported non-precious catalysts. Moreover, this hybrid shows high current density, lower Tafel slope and excellent stability. The synergetic coupling effects between MCNTs and oxide featured with flower-like morphology and improved microtexture properties are key factors for the superior catalytic activity of NiCo2O4- MCNTs hybrid.

# **Introduction**

The increasing consumption of fossil fuels gradually releases greenhouse gases leading to climate change and global warming. Besides polluting the environment, these non-renewable energy resources are gradually being depleted. [1,2] One of the most promising and sustainable approaches to prevail this issue is by using alternative energy resources that are renewable. The production of hydrogen from water-gas shift reaction is contaminated with CO impurity, which may cause the catalyst

**Supporting information:** XRD pattern of hybrid precursor, Raman spectra, and EDS mapping of composite and MCNTs are presented. The comparison Table for OER activity of NiCo2O4-MCNTs catalyst with literature reports, and HER activity of the bare GCE with Pt foil and

poisoning and subsequently hindered the further hydrogen utilization processes. On the other hand, electrochemical water splitting reaction is one of the techniques that have been proposed a decade ago to generate H2 and O2 from water *via* oxygen evolution reaction at the anode and hydrogen evolution reaction at the cathode, respectively. [2-4] Using this approach one can effectively use hydrogen as an alternative fuel source because it has high energy density. In other words, water splitting reaction represents a way of storing energy in the form of H2 and O2, which got attention due to its high energy efficiency, trivial environmental pollution and other potentially wide range of applications. [3-7] However, the overpotentials (η) greater than 1.80 V are required instead of ∼1.23 V theoretical value for both halfcell reactions of water electrolysis (HER and OER) to achieve expected reaction rates. [6,7] Moreover, both HER and OER of the electrochemical water splitting are kinetically sluggish and thus need catalysts to produce high purity hydrogen as economically viable.

 At present, effective electrochemical water oxidation at highly reduced overpotentials is achievable only with noble metal based catalysts such as RuO2/IrO2 for OER, and platinum or its alloys for HER. [8,9] However, high-priced and scarcity of these noble metals/metal oxides limit their widespread usage in practical applications. Therefore, in the last few years, researchers have made an enormous effort to downsize the noble metal content, to tune the intrinsic activity and to increase the stability of the catalytic component. [10-14] Altogether, a major challenge in this field is to develop ideal bifunctional electrocatalyst with high efficient, cost-effective and with a durable robust nature, which can be integrated with fuel cell for the commercial application of electric vehicles.

 To surmount the aforementioned bottlenecks in practical applications several materials, for instance, metal oxides, [12,15] hydroxides, [14,16] chalcogenides[13,17] and phosphides[18] were largely scrutinized for electricity-driven water splitting catalysts. Among the contenders, metal oxides particularly mixed transition metal spinel oxides of type AB2O4 (A, B = 3d-transition metals) are known to be highly active and efficient catalysts for water oxidation and suggested as inexpensive and alternatives to precious noble metal catalysts. [19-24] For instance, nickel cobaltite (NiCo2O4) stands out as a promising electrocatalyst for water oxidation due to its overwhelming benefits such as abundant, huge specific surface area, high conductivity, strong corrosion resistance, low overpotential, more active sites and rich redox chemistry originated from the co-existence of nickel and cobalt ions. [25-27] As a result of multiple oxidation states in NiCo2O4 spinel where cobalt reside in both voids (octahedral and tetrahedral) while nickel reside only on tetrahedral voids, both redox couples (Co3+/Co2+ and Ni3+/Ni2+) safeguard an enhanced electrocatalytic activity. Moreover, the hybrid nanostructured materials fabricated by hybridizing NiCo2O4 with conductive carbon supports (e.g., 2D graphene and 1D carbon nanotubes) demonstrated an attractive electrocatalytic activity and good stability compared to the solitary NiCo2O4. [11,28-32] Such hybridization can empower adaptable and appropriate properties with performances far beyond than those of the individual materials.

 Till date, various NiCo2O4/carbon composites have been developed by different methods and are effectively utilized for OER applications. [32-36] For instance, surfactant-assisted NiCo2O4 nanoplatelets anchored on graphene exhibits good catalytic activity in oxygen reduction and evolution reactions. [28] N-doped graphene-NiCo2O4 hybrid thin film unveils a remarkable OER activity with enhanced reaction kinetics and stability. [33] Further, NiCo2O4 supported on graphene-MnO2 3D frame work prepared by a self-assembly approach shows prominent activity and stability in OER compared to NiCo2O4-graphene and benchmark RuO2. [34] The NiCo2O4 nanosheet-MCNTs composite produced by one-pot solution process using polyvinylpyrrolidone surfactant demonstrates improved OER activity and stability compared to NiCo2O4/activated carbon and NiCo2O4. [35] Of late, we have also reported solvent dependent on surface morphology and textural properties of the NiCo2O4/rGO hybrid composite for anodic OER applications. [36] However, most of the literature pertinent to the NiCo2O4 hybrids including NiCo2O4/MCNTs have focused mainly on OER applications[37] and there are no reports on bifunctional catalysts which are effective for both HER and OER catalysis in the same electrolyte environment. Moreover, many reported synthesis approaches of the hybrid composites in the literature are complicated, expensive and time-consuming processes. It is, therefore, a challenging and desirable to develop an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water oxidation. We have taken up this problem to develop highly active and stable bifunctional catalyst by simple and cost-effective hydrothermal method without using structural directing agents such as surfactants and/or chelating agents. Such a bifunctional catalyst can be more active and stable for electrochemical water splitting process in alkaline medium. They can also reduce the costs and be ideal candidates for a large-scale commercial production of hydrogen and oxygen.

 Herein we report porous hierarchical flower-like nickel cobalt spinel anchored on conductive MCNTs (NiCo2O4-MCNTs) by a facile surfactant free hydrothermal process followed by thermally driven conversion treatment. The combined physicochemical and electrochemical measurements were carried out on hybrid NiCo2O4-MCNTs and pristine NiCo2O4 samples in order to check the role of conductive MCNTs. The NiCo2O4-MCNTs composite required an extremely small overpotentials of 350 and 209 mV, respectively, for OER and HER to drive a benchmark current density of 10 mA cm-2 which are strikingly lower than those of pure NiCo2O4 and MCNTs. By taking the advantage of the improved porosity, surface area and conductivity of nickel cobalt spinel in hybrid, which are critical factors in improving mass transport and number of active sites, and thereby promoting as the bifunctional electrocatalyst for the overall water splitting reaction in an alkaline electrolyte.

# **Results and Discussion**

#### **Morphology and structural analysis**

The phase purity and crystallographic structure of the hydrothermally prepared hybrid precursor sample are obtained first by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, as shown in Figure S1. The diffraction peaks in XRD detected at respective positions can be attributed to the nickel cobalt hydroxyl carbonate, NCHC; (Ni,Co)2CO3 (OH)2 (JCPDS # 35-0501 and 48-0083).[38] The formation of NCHC precursor and its further decomposition to corresponding NiCo2O4 spinel has been reported in the literature. [38,39a] The thermal weight loss of the hybrid and pristine NCHC precursor samples were determined by thermogravimetric (TG) and differential thermal gravimetric (DTG) analysis, as shown in Figure 1. Both precursor samples display two kinds of weight loss in their TG profiles, the initial sharp weight loss observed at around 313 °C for the NCHC-MCNTs hybrid and 312 °C for pristine NCHC samples are ascribed to decomposition of NCHC precursors into corresponding NiCo2O4 spinel by releasing H2O and CO2 gases. The weight loss at about 800 °C can be ascribed to the decomposition of spinel nickel cobaltite into parent simple nickel oxide and cobalt oxides. [39a] As confirmed in Figure 1A, additional weight losses observed only in the hybrid precursor at about 420 °C are attributed to the combustion of carbon skeleton in MWCNTs. [36] Compared to NCHC precursor, the hybrid NCHC-MCNTs precursor exhibits higher total weight loss of 25% due to removal of additional oxygenated functional groups from the MCNTs.

**Figure 1.** TG and DTG profiles of (A) nickel cobalt hydroxy carbonate-MCNTs hybrid and (B) pristine nickel cobalt hydroxy carbonate precursor samples.

 After sintering at 350 °C in air, the NCHC-MCNTs hybrid and pristine NCHC precursors are completely transformed into NiCo2O4-MWCNTs and NiCo2O4 spinel as evidenced by powder XRD in Figure 2. Both hybrid and pristine NiCo2O4 samples reveal well diffraction peaks owing to the formation of face centered cubic spinel structure (JCPDS # 73-1702) without any impurity phase. In addition, the XRD pattern of pristine MCNTs (Figure S2) shows diffraction peak at 25.2° and 42.6° correspond to the (100) and (110) planes of hexagonal graphitic carbon. However, such diffraction peaks are not observed in the NiCo2O4-MCNTs hybrid on account of relatively low amount of carbon in the composite. [39b] The computed mean crystallite size of the hybrid NiCo2O4-MCNTs composite is much smaller (∼12 nm) than that of pristine NiCo2O4 (∼21 nm). Likewise, the lattice parameter for NiCo2O4-MCNTs is 0.895 nm and for NiCo2O4 is 0.891 nm.

**Figure 2.** Powder XRD pattern of NiCo2O4-MCNTs hybrid and pristine NiCo2O4 samples.

 Figure S3 compares the Raman spectra of NiCo2O4-MCNTs hybrid and pure MCNTs samples measured at room temperature. Both of the samples display two characteristic bands of carbon materials including D and G bands, respectively at about 1334 and 1586 cm-1. [31,36] The D band attributes to disorder/defective nature of carbon atoms and the G band represents the graphitic structure due to E2g phonon of sp2 carbon atoms in the graphite sheets.[32,36] From the conductivity measurements, as shown in Figure S4 (detailed information can be found in the experimental methods), the hybrid NiCo2O4-MCNTs composite (∼7.83 S/cm) shows six times higher conductivity compared to the pristine NiCo2O4 (∼1.32 S/cm). Moreover, the obtained conductivity value of our NiCo2O4-MCNTs hybrid is better than the recently reported NiCo2O4-rGO nanocomposite (∼6.68 S/cm) [40a] and NiCo2O4 nanoparticles (∼4 S/cm)[40b] . Such high conductivity of the hybrid NiCo2O4-MWCNTs could endow sufficient electroactive sites, minimizing ion transport pathways and enhancing the electron collection efficiency.

 The XPS full-scan survey spectrum of the hybrid composite (Figure 3A) illustrates the existence of prominent elements Ni, Co, C, and O on the near-surface of NiCo2O4-MWCNTs, which is in good agreement with the literature reports. [41] The deconvolution of Co 2p, Ni 2p, O 1s and C 1s spectral regions are displayed in Figure 3B-E. The Ni 2p spectrum, as shown in Figure 3B, best fitted by considering two spin-orbit doublets (Ni 2p1/2 and Ni 2p3/2) and two shake-up satellites (marked as "Sat."). [37,41a] Specifically, the fitting peaks at binding energy (BE) of 856.5 and 874.0 eV ascribed to Ni3<sup>+</sup> , while the other peaks at 854.7 and 872.2 eV are assigned to Ni2<sup>+</sup>. The satellite peaks are recognized at 861.6 and 879.3 eV. Likewise, the core level Co 2p spectrum (Figure 3C) shows two spin-orbit doublets (Co 2p1/2 and Co 2p3/2) and two shakeup satellites.[42] The peaks at BE of 779.7 and 795.0 eV, corresponds to Co3+ while the peaks at 782.3 and 798.2 eV due to Co2+. The shakeup satellite peaks evidenced at 788.2 and 804.1 eV. The higher valances are expected to assist fast charge carrier transport across the electrode/electrolyte interface. In Figure 3D, the core level spectrum of O 1s deconvoluted into four different oxygen species located at BE of 529.1, 530.3, 531.2 and 532.4 eV which have been represented as O1, O2, O3 and O4, respectively. [23,] Among four, the O1 component is the most intense one and is attributed to the oxygen bonding with metal (M-O-M), indicates most of the oxygen is present in the lattice. [26,28] The second O2 component arises as a result of large number of defect sites primarily due to existence of a variety of oxygenated species such as hydroxyl, chemisorbed oxygen with minimum oxygen coordination. [23,25] The component O3 is corresponding to water bound on surface of sample. [40a] The final O4 component is due to multiplicity of physi-/chemisorbed water at or within the surface of the spinel. [23,35] The deconvoluted C 1s spectrum (Figure 3E) reveals a divergent functional groups of carbon like C=C/C−C, −C−OH and −C=O groups in the surface of oxidized MCNTs,[33,35] which are strongly coupled with NiCo2O4 through strong chemical bond like covalent bond and by weak bonds like van der Walls forces and/or hydrogen bonding leading to direct growth of the spinel NiCo2O4 on MCNTs surface. The XPS results

illustrate that the hybrid composite consists chemical composition of Ni2+/Ni3+, Co2+/Co3+, C and O species. Therefore, it is expected that the binary solid state redox couples such as Co3<sup>+</sup>/Co2<sup>+</sup> and Ni3<sup>+</sup>/Ni2<sup>+</sup> in the composite can afford an adequate electroactive sites in electrochemical water splitting.

 To investigate the morphology of NiCo2O4-MWCNTs hybrid, field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) was carried out and the corresponding images are shown in Figure 4. The FESEM images of the NiCo2O4-MWCNTs composite in Figure 4A, B display a large-scale, dense, porous hierarchical flower-like morphology with diameter of about 4-5 µm and are strongly anchored on the surface of MWCNTs. In comparison to NiCo2O4-MCNTs hybrid, the pristine NiCo2O4 also exhibits similar flower-like morphology (Figure 4D, E). The high-magnified FESEM images of the hybrid and pristine samples are presented in Figure 4C, F. As seen that hierarchical flower-like morphologies are developed by dozens of nanowires interconnected to each other through the center and the diameter of the nanowires gradually decreases from centre to the tip.

 To obtain more detailed information about morphology and elemental distribution of the hybrid NiCo2O4-MCNTs material, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed and the corresponding results are presented in Figure 5 and S6. The TEM pictures in Figure 5A, B revealed that the flower-like morphology of NiCo2O4 are constructed by numerous long nanowires which epitaxially grown from the center. The diameter of the nanowires is about 25-30 nm and the texture of nanowires is mesoporous in nature (inset of Figure 5C). More prominently, the nanowires are hybridized effectively over MWCNTs (Figure 5B-D) which affords a much adequate synergetic effect between MWCNTs and NiCo2O4 spinel. Figure S5 compares the different magnified TEM images of the hybrid and pristine NiCo2O4 samples. It can be found that when compared to pristine NiCo2O4 (Figures S5D-F), the hybrid composite revealed anchoring of NiCo2O4 nanowires on MCNTs (Figure S5A-C). Besides, the mutual contact between nanowires and MCNTs indicates that the morphology of the oxide material grows not only on individual MCNTs but also at the contact sites between MCNTs, forming a better conductive network. The high-resolution TEM images of the NiCo2O4-MCNTs composite (Figure 5E, F) revealed a well-resolved crystal lattice fringes with d-spacing of 0.284 and 0.463 nm can be assigned to the (220) and (111) crystallographic plane of oxide spinel. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of the corresponding sample shown in the inset of Figure 5F, which reveals the polycrystalline nature of the nickel cobalt spinel. The SAED pattern possesses well-defined diffraction rings, which are well indexed to the (111), (220), (311), (400), (511) and (440) crystallographic planes respectively of the nickel cobalt spinel (JCPDS no # 73-1702). The EDS mapping images further confirm the presence of elements Ni, Co, O, and C evenly dispersed in the hybrid composite (Figure S6). The atomic ratio of Co/Ni in the NiCo2O4-MCNTs composite is about 2:1, which is in good consistence with experimental observations (Figure S7). Besides, the morphology of surface oxidized MCNTs in Figure S8 exhibits well-ordered tubes with an average diameter of 25 nm and their lengths are about 10 μm.

 The formation of hierarchical flower-like nickel cobalt hydroxyl carbonate from nascent crystallite under hydrothermal condition (mainly at high temperature and pressure) involves multifarious contributing factors that encompass van der Waals forces, crystal-face attraction, intermolecular interactions, steric factors, hydrophobic attraction, hydrogen bonding, intrinsic crystal contraction, electrostatic and dipolar fields, and Ostwald ripening. [38,43a] Other factors such as kinetics and concentration of the reactants as well as reaction conditions are also equally contributed in determining the size and shape of inorganic nanocrystals which further influenced the final morphology. [38,43b] However, the growth of flower-like morphology primarily involve the (i) nucleation of NCHC and grow up to nanosized particles, (ii) Ostwald repining followed by self-assembling to nanowires, and (iii) impetuous self-transformation to hierarchical flower-like structure during the sintering at an elevated temperature. [38,43,44] Moreover, in the course of the growth process, the oxidized MCNTs render good anchoring sites for positively charged Ni2+ and Co2+ cations *via* electrostatic forces owing to the presence of abundant oxygenated functional groups, for instance, −C−OH, −C=O and −COOH on the surface of MCNTs. [40a] The schematic possible formation of hierarchical flower-like NiCo2O4-MCNTs hybrid is shown in Scheme 1.

 The surface textural characteristics of NiCo2O4-MCNTs hybrid and pristine (NiCo2O4 and MCNTs) samples were evaluated by using nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms (Figure 6). Both hybrid and pristine NiCo2O4 samples show typical type-IV with H3 hysteresis loops and the capillary condensation step from P/P0 of 0.4 to 0.99, corresponds to mesoporous texture of the samples. [45] The hybrid NiCo2O4-MCNTs (inset of Figure 6A) exhibits bi-modal pore size distribution with pore maxima values 3.2 and 10.5 nm, whereas in pristine NiCo2O4 (inset of Figure 6B) exhibit tri-modal pore size distribution with 3.9, 8.5 and 15.8 nm located pore maxima values. The calculated specific surface areas for the hybrid NiCo2O4-MCNTs and pure NiCo2O4 samples are 103 and 64 m2 g-1 respectively. As seen from specific surface area values, the incorporation of a small amount of MCNTs into NiCo2O4 significantly improves the surface area and porosity of the oxide. However, the specific surface area of pure MCNTs is 198 m2 g-1 (Figure 6C), which is fairly higher than that of the hybrid NiCo2O4- MCNTs. The downsized specific surface area in the composite sample could be attributed to the introduction of nickel cobaltite particles since they have large particles size and relatively high density compared to the carbon materials such as MCNTs. Nonetheless, the enriched texture properties of NiCo2O4-MCNTs along with indispensable pore-size distribution provide a large number of electroactive sites for an efficient mass transport during the electrochemical process. Therefore, the hierarchical flowerlike NiCo2O4-MCNTs hybrid promotes fast electron transfer and increased utilization of the active catalyst.

#### **Electrochemical studies**

The electrocatalytic activity towards anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) process of the NiCo2O4-MCNTs hybrid is first examined by linear sweeping voltammetry (LSV) using a threeelectrode configuration in 0.1 M KOH (detailed methods are given in supporting information). For comparison, the OER activity of the pristine NiCo2O4 and MCNTs, as well as benchmark RuO2 catalysts are also examined under identical conditions. Figure 7A compares the OER polarization curves of four different electrodes at a sweep rate of 5 mV s-1. It is evident that the pristine MCNTs have shown poor catalytic activity towards OER. In contrast, the polarization curves of NiCo2O4-MCNTs and NiCo2O4 show two types of anodic peaks. The broad oxidation feature centered at around 1.33 V (vs. RHE) is signature of the oxidation of metals from lower to higher oxidation states (Ni2+ to Ni3+ and Co2+ to Co3+ through the following reaction in an alkaline medium, NiCo2O4 + OH<sup>−</sup> + H2O ↔ NiOOH + 2CoOOH + e- ). [46] Typically, NiOOH and CoOOH have been considered as the active sites for water oxidation. [47] As one can see in Figure 7A, the intensity of oxidation wave is more pronounced in case of NiCo2O4-MCNTs compared to pristine NiCo2O4. The sharp increase in oxidation current density beyond 1.48 V (vs. RHE) owing to the evolution of oxygen from water oxidation reaction, OER: 4OH<sup>−</sup> → 2H2O + O2 + 4e<sup>−</sup>. [23,36] Among electrode materials, NiCo2O4-MCNTs exhibits excellent electrocatalytic activity with low OER onset potential of 1.48 V (vs. RHE) and maximum current density over 66 mA cm-2 at 2.0 V (vs. RHE). To the best of our knowledge, onset potential of our hybrid NiCo2O4-MCNTs is much smaller than the onset potentials of various reported nonprecious electrocatalysts such as metal oxides, hydroxides, chalcogenides and its hybrids (Table S1). The OER kinetics of resulting electrode materials is further examined by Tafel plots (Figure 7B). A smaller Tafel slope of 54 mV dec-1 is witnessed for the hybrid NiCo2O4-MCNTs compared to individual electrodes (i.e., NiCo2O4 is 67 mV dec-1 and MCNTs is 141 mV dec-1) and benchmark RuO2 (86 mV dec-1), suggesting efficient electron and mass transfer of the hybrid composite.

 In order to precisely evaluate the OER catalytic activity further, we computed overpotential necessary to achieve magnitude current density of 10 mA cm-2. [20,46] The hybrid NiCo2O4-MCNTs composite require as low as 350 mV of overpotential to reach the current density of 10 mA cm-2 (η10), which is smaller than the individual components (NiCo2O4 (∼430 mV) and MCNTs (∼660 mV)) and benchmark RuO2 (380 mV). It is to be noted that the overpotential of our hybrid NiCo2O4-MCNTs composite reported here is in good comparable or even much better than many nonnoble metal based OER electrocatalysts reported recently (Figure 7C).[15,20,22,28,29,33, 48-53] The low overpotential, a large current density and smaller Tafel slope underscores the superiority of the hybrid NiCo2O4-MCNTs towards OER activity. The improved performances of the hybrid can be attributed to a synergetic coupling between MCNTs and electrocatalytically active NiCo2O4.

 Further we measured the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy to assess the kinetics of the electrode reaction.[16] The Nyquiest plots (Z′ vs. Z″) of the hybrid and pristine NiCo2O4 electrodes were recorded in 0.1 M KOH at an applied potential of 1.49 V (vs. RHE) and displayed in Figure S9 with data fitting equivalent circuit. The circuit to illustrate the resulting impedance data mainly consist of three components, namely the solution resistance (Rs), charge transfer resistance (Rct) across the electrode/solution interface and a constant-phase element (CPE).[15,47b] Among two electrodes, the NiCo2O4-MCNTs exhibits a smaller diameter of the semicircle, indicating smaller Rct of 15.1 Ω than that of pristine NiCo2O4 (∼19.3 Ω), indicative of faster OER kinetics and an efficient charge transport at the hybrid electrode during electrochemical process.

 According to the widely accepted mechanism proposed by Bockris and Otagawa for OER on metal oxide catalysts system involves five consecutive steps, which can be described in the eqns. S1 to S5 in supporting information. [54] Therein, the initial step begins with an adsorption of hydroxyl anion (OH<sup>−</sup>) from alkaline media on the surface active sites (S) of the catalyst to produce adsorbed OH species with the liberation of e<sup>−</sup> (eqn. S1). The consequent step is the reaction between hydroxyl anion (OH<sup>−</sup> ) and adsorbed OH species to generate surface oxide layer (SO) with the liberation of H2O and e<sup>−</sup> (eqn. S2). In third step, hydroxylation reaction between surface oxide layer and hydroxyl anion (OH<sup>−</sup> ) to form an active intermediate oxy-hydroxide layer such as OOH species (eqn. S3). The intermediate oxy-hydroxide layer further reacts with superfluous hydroxyl anion, to form adsorbed O2 and H2O with liberation of e<sup>−</sup> (eqn. S4). The final step implicates oxygen evolution from the surface of active sites (eqn. S5).

 The electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) of an electrode is also an important deciding factor that can influence

the electrocatalytic activity of electrode. [31,46] Thus, we quantified the ECSA of both hybrid and pristine electrodes from cyclic voltammetry (CV) study. For this, the CV study were recorded at varies sweep rates (2−20 mV s-1) in non-Faradaic potential range of 1.0−1.1 V (vs. RHE), as depicted in Figure 8A, B. It has been reported that the charging current, ic is equal to the product of the sweep rate, ν and the electrochemical double layer capacitance, Cdl which can be obtained from the following eqn. <sup>c</sup> dl i C = ν× . [55] The ic values for both electrodes are measured at a potential of 1.05 V vs. RHE from CV sweeps in Figure 8A, B, and plotted against sweep rate (from 2 to 20 mV s-1), which give a linear relationship with a slope of Cdl (Figure 8C). The estimated Cdl value for the NiCo2O4-MCNTs composite is 1.67 mF cm-2 while that for pristine NiCo2O4 is 0.82 mF cm-2, which is only half of the hybrid composite. The ECSA values are computed by the eqn.: ECSA C /C = dl S , where CS signifies the theoretical capacitance developed on oxide surface, typically considered as 60 µF cm-2. [16] The relative magnitude of the respective roughness factor (Rf) is obtained by taking the estimated ECSA and dividing it by electrode surface area. The estimated ECSA values for NiCo2O4- MCNTs and NiCo2O4 are 27.8 and 13.6 cm2, and Rf values are 100 and 49, respectively. The large ECSA and Rf values further strengthen the fact that the NiCo2O4-MCNTs composite provides more exposed interior surfaces with enriched exploitation of electroactive sites leading to higher OER activity. At a potential of 1.60 V (vs. RHE), the mass activity and specific activity for NiCo2O4-MCNTs hybrid are 48.33 A g-1 and 0.116 mA cm-2 ECSA, respectively, outperform the pristine NiCo2O4 are 22.37 A g-1 and 0.067 mA cm-2 ECSA. The intrinsic activities of the resulting electrodes are further resolved by turnover frequency (TOF), presuming each metal atom to be catalytically active. As shown in Figure 8D, the TOF value of the NiCo2O4-MCNTs is found to be 3.29×10<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> s<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> which is higher than pristine NiCo2O4 (1.35×10<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> s<sup>−</sup>1) and reported NiCo2O4/NiO and NiO, [15] suggesting excellent OER catalytic activity of the hybrid.

**Figure 8.** CV curves of (A) NiCo2O4-MCNTs hybrid and (B) pristine NiCo2O4 electrodes recorded in 0.1 M KOH at scan rates of 2, 5, 8, 10, 15 and 20 mV s-1 ; (C) Capacitive current (ic) measured at 1.05 V (vs. RHE) as a function of scan rate for the two electrodes and (D) comparison of roughness factor (Rf) and turnover frequency (TOF) of NiCo2O4-MCNTs and NiCo2O4 electrodes.

 The catalytic capabilities of the resulting hybrid and pristine electrode materials for HER were further evaluated in 0.1 M KOH to inspect the possibility for overall water splitting (Figure 9). [12,16] The HER measurements of NiCo2O4-MCNTs hybrid and pristine NiCo2O4 electrode materials were carried out in a standard threeelectrode configuration at a sweep rate of 5 mV s-1. As the group for comparison, commercial carbon-supported Pt catalyst (20 wt% Pt on Vulcan XC-72, Pt/C) was also evaluated under identical conditions. Figure 9A compares the HER polarization curves of the NiCo2O4-MCNTs, NiCo2O4, MCNTs and benchmark Pt/C at a sweep rate of 5 mV s-1. It can be found that the NiCo2O4-MCNTs

composite shows excellent HER performance with lower onset potential along with a rapid increment in current density in compared to individual NiCo2O4 and MCNTs. Specifically, for NiCo2O4-MCNTs hybrid needs overpotential as low as of 209 mV to reach a magnitude current density of -10 mA cm-2, which is smaller than those of NiCo2O4 (∼257 mV) and MCNTs (∼425 mV). Notably, the benchmark Pt/C is still exhibits the best HER activity with extremely small overpotential of 35 mV. It is worth noting that the hybrid NiCo2O4-MCNTs composite performs as an efficient electrocatalyst with a smaller overpotential than the reported numerous non-noble metal HER catalysts, as listed in Figure 9C. [12,13,32,50,57-62] Even though MCNTs itself have shown insignificant HER activity, once it is effectively hybridized with NiCo2O4, as a result, large current density along with downsized overpotential from 257 to 209 mV is achieved. The enhanced HER activity of the NiCo2O4-MCNTs composite is attributed to the synergistic effect between MCNTs and metal oxide leading to enhanced reactive sites and fast charge transport.

 The linear fitting of Tafel plots of different electrode materials were derived from the HER polarization curves. As shown in Figure 9B, a smaller Tafel slope of 59 mV dec-1 is noticed for NiCo2O4-MCNTs composite than those of individual constituents of NiCo2O4 (∼72 mV dec-1) and MCNTs (∼156 mV dec-1), implying a faster HER process with higher efficiency. The Tafel slope of 49 mV dec-1 is attributes to the benchmark Pt/C, which is coincides well with previous reports.[12] It has been reported that the cathodic HER process mainly follows two different pathways such as Volmer-Heyrovsky and Volmer-Tafel in alkaline solutions.[12,13,27] In both ways the initial step begins with adsorption of H2O molecules. The consequent step involves two Hads combines directly to produce H2 in the case of Volmer-Tafel mechanism (eqn. S6, supporting information) or formation of H2 by combining with another proton source and e<sup>−</sup> according to Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism (eqn. S7).[27,62,63] Depending upon rate determining step, the Tafel slopes of 120, 40, and 30 mV dec-1 should be observed for Volmer, Heyrovsky or Tafel component, respectively. Therefore, in this study, the Tafel slope of 59 mV dec-1 is observed for NiCo2O4-MCNTs composite (Figure 9B), implying that HER on the hybrid composite electrode occurs *via* Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanistic pathway and the Heyrovsky step is the rate-limiting step for this reaction. Moreover, the Tafel slope of NiCo2O4- MCNTs hybrid is comparatively smaller than the various reported non-precious metal catalysts.[18,32,50,51,57]

 For energy conversion and storage systems, the long-time electrocatalytic durability towards the complex electrochemical reactions is essential factor to determine the quality of the electrode material. Therefore, the long-term durability of the representative NiCo2O4-MCNTs hybrid and pristine NiCo2O4 toward OER and HER are evaluated separately by using chronoamperometry (CA) experiment in 0.1 M KOH solution. The OER durability curves for both hybrid and pristine electrode materials were acquired at a constant bias potential of 1.62 V vs. RHE for consecutive 10 h (upper current-time (I–t) curves in Figure 10). As seen, the current density of hybrid NiCo2O4- MCNTs composite decreases rapidly in the beginning 30 min and afterword it becomes constant even up to 10 h without any significant current decay, whereas in case of pristine NiCo2O4 the current gradually drops with time.

The durability test for HER was also performed under similar conditions at a constant bias potential of -0.16 V vs. RHE (lower I–t curves in Figure 10). The NiCo2O4-MCNTs composite exhibits highly stable performance with 80% catalytic current retention in long-term continuous operation for 36000 s (10 h) than that of solitary NiCo2O4 (62% retention). Furthermore, HER polarization curves of the resulting electrodes were recorded before and after chronoamperometry (CA) stability test (Figure S10). The profiles of NiCo2O4-MCNTs hybrid exhibits highly stable performance with negligible change in overpotential (∼8 mV) even after long-term durability for 10 h, whereas in pristine NiCo2O4 a large enhancement of ∼55 mV can be found in overpotential at η10. Altogether, the durability test confirmed that the NiCo2O4-MCNTs composite have remarkable stability for both OER and HER under an alkaline condition. The increased durability of the composite electrode evokes from a strong synergistic interaction between the nickel cobaltite and MCNTs. Moreover, the supportive MCNTs could effectively prevent from the aggregation and dissolution of oxide nanoparticles during the vigorous electrochemical process, usually involves huge amount bubble formation on the surface of electrodes.

 In order to confirm whether the Pt counter electrode can influence on HER performance, we performed LSV polarization curves for HER in 0.1 M KOH solution using bare GCE (glassy carbon electrode) as the working electrode and Pt foil and/or graphite rod as the counter electrode. [64,65] Figure S11A compares the HER performance of GCE working electrode when graphite rod or Pt foil is separately used as the counter electrode. No significant change has been observed in current densities and/or onset potentials while changing the counter electrode from Pt foil to graphite rod. The HER activity is maintained stable with increasing numbers of CV cycles (Figure S11B, C). Therefore, the effect of counter electrode on HER is negligible in this work.

**Figure 10.** Long-term stability (i-t) curves for OER and HER on NiCo2O4-MCNTs hybrid and NiCo2O4 electrodes in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte; applied bias potentials are 1.60 V (vs. RHE) for OER and -0.16 V (vs. RHE) for HER.

 Based on the above results, the improved electrochemical performance towards both OER and HER of the hybrid NiCo2O4- MCNTs composite can be ascribed from following aspects: [29,66,67] the (i) NiCo2O4-MCNTs with high surface area with indispensable pore-size distribution greatly enhance contact area between electrode and electrolyte interface and promote fast electron transfer. (ii) Functionalized MCNTs consists several hydrophilic functional groups which can intimately interact with NiCo2O4 via electrostatic interactions and van der Walls forces, which could provide a good dispersion and stability of NiCo2O4. (iii) When combining the NiCo2O4 and MCNTs at a molecular scale, there are strong synergistic interactions between them and promote good structural and electrochemical properties compared to individual NiCo2O4. (iv) Hierarchical flower-like morphology assembled with 1D-nanowires alleviates the strain caused by the volume expansion, leading to a remarkable stability.

# **Conclusions**

In summary, we have adopted a simple, cost-effective hydrothermal technique to synthesize porous hierarchical flowerlike NiCo2O4-MCNTs hybrid with a strong synergistic effects and rendering it as an efficient bifunctional electrode for both OER and HER under alkaline conditions. The as-fabricated hybrid NiCo2O4- MCNTs nanocomposite reaps remarkable surface textural properties such as large specific surface area with indispensable pore-size distribution, hierarchical flower-like morphology and large conductivity, which are all essential in improving the performance of electrochemical overall water splitting. The electrochemical measurements demonstrated that NiCo2O4- MCNTs hybrid showed an attractive OER and HER electrocatalytic activity in terms of low overpotential, favorable kinetics and durable stability in alkaline solution. Notably, very small overpotentials, 350 and 209 mV are needed to achieve a benchmark current density of 10 mA cm-2 for OER and HER. The overpotential values of hybrid are much lower than that of the individual NiCo2O4 and MCNTs and literature reported nonprecious catalysts. The improved electrocatalytic activity of the hybrid is originating from the strong synergistic chemical coupling between MCNTs and nickel cobaltite leading to dual-active-site mechanisms. This work presents a versatile strategy for the fabrication of new and tailored non-precious oxide based spinel hybrid nanostructures as highly efficient, cost-effective and stable electrocatalysts for overall water splitting (i.e., both anodic OER and cathodic HER) under alkaline electrolyte.

# **Experimental Section**

# **Materials**

Unless otherwise specified, all the chemicals employed in this study were used as received without any further purification. Ni(NO3)2.6H2O (99.9%, SD Fine), Co(NO3)2.6H2O (99.9%, SD Fine), urea (Thomas-Baker), NH4F (Merck), H2SO4 (Merck), HNO3 (Merck) and MCNTs (Sigma Aldrich). Deionized (DI) water was used in all the experiments.

#### **Oxidation of multi-walled carbon nanotubes**

For a covalent functionalization of MWCNTs, a 500 mg of asreceived MCNTs were well dispersed in the mixture of concentrated H2SO4 and HNO3 (3:1 v/v) by an ultra-sonication technique for 1 h. Then, the total reaction mixture was refluxed in an oil bath at 80 °C for 10 h, so as to graft hydroxy functional groups on surface of MCNTs. The resulting mixture underwent centrifugation, decanting and purified by repeated washing using alcohol and DI H2O, and subsequently vacuum-dried at 100 °C for overnight.

#### **Synthesis of NiCo2O4-MCNTs hybrid composite**

Typically, 50 mg of oxidized MCNTs was uniformly dispersed into 100 mL of deionized water with the assistance of ultra-sonication for at least 30 min. Then, Ni(NO3)2.6H2O (3 mmol) and Co(NO3)2.6H2O (6 mmol) metal precursors (Ni and Co, molar ratio 1:2) were added with constant intense stirring for 2 h. Subsequently, 12 mmol of NH4F and 32 mmol of urea were added under stirring. The resulting homogeneous transparent mixture was transferred to a 150 mL capacity Teflon-lined autoclave, sealed and heated for 12 h at 150 °C in an oven. After cool down to room temperature, the sample was collected, thoroughly rinsed with DI water and alcohol by centrifugation (5 min each) for several times to remove residual reagents, if any. The as-obtained nickel cobalt hydroxyl carbonate-MCNTs (NCHC-MCNTs) precursor product was dried at 60 °C, and then sintered in air at 350 °C for 3 h with a temperature rising rate of 5 °C min-1 to result in a well crystallized hybrid NiCo2O4-MCNTs composite. The NiCo2O4 content in the resulting hybrid composite is 92 wt% and MCNTs content is 8 wt%. For comparison, pristine NiCo2O4 was prepared using a similar process without adding MCNTs.

#### **Materials characterization**

Thermal analysis of the as-synthesized NCHC-MCNTs and NCHC precursors were tested using thermogravimetric (TG) and differential thermal gravimetric (DTG) analysis in O2 flow at a scan speed of 20 °C min-1 on a TA Q500V20.10 Build 36 instrument. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements (Cu Kα radiation source) were performed on the products with a Bruker AXS D8 diffractometer to identify the crystallographic phases. Raman spectrums were recorded using Horiba HR 800UV Raman spectrometer with a laser excitation of 632.8 nm. Multi-point specific surface area and pore-size distribution of the sintered materials were studied by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) and Barret-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) methods on Micromeritics ASAP 2020 physisorption tool. For the surface topography and composition of the products, field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) was conducted at FEI, Quanta 400 microscope equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray (EDX, AMETEK) spectrometry detector. TEM images were monitored with a JEM 3010 instrument. Elemental analysis and their valence states of NiCo2O4-MWCNTs composite were examined by X-ray photoelectron spectrum (XPS) using Omicron Nanotechnology instrument with Mg Kα X-ray radiation source. All spectra were calibrated based on the C1s peak (284.50 eV).

### **Conductivity measurements**

Electrical conductivity of the NiCo2O4-MCNTs hybrid and pristine NiCo2O4 were conducted by direct current (dc) polarization test at 0.2 V, according to the method described in the literature. [68] Prior to experiment, the hybrid and/or pristine NiCo2O4 powders were pressed into pellets with a PTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene) cylinder body having inner diameter of 10 mm, and then carbon foils as blocking electrodes were laid on both sides of the pellet by pressing at 200 MPa. The electrical conductivity (σ) of the samples at room temperature were obtained from the dc polarizations (current, I vs. time, t curves) in Figure S4, using the following equations:

Resistance (R) = 
$$\frac{V}{I}$$

Conductivity 
$$(\sigma) = \frac{l}{R \times a}$$

where *l* and *a* represent the thickness (∼1.5 cm) and surface area (∼0.785 cm2) of the pressed pellet, respectively. And I and V are the current (in amperes) and potential (volts).

#### **Electrochemical measurements**

The electrocatalytic activity towards OER and HER measurements of the hybrid and pristine electrodes were performed *via* three electrode system employing CH instruments electrochemical workstation (Modal: CHI6081C). The saturated calomel electrode (SCE) and Pt foil (the results were verified with graphite counter electrode too) were used as reference and counter electrodes, respectively. The working electrodes were fabricated as follows: a known amount of the catalyst powder was well dispersed in water-ethanol mixture (2 mL, 3:2 v/v) and 5 wt% Nafion solution (200 µL) with the aid of ultrasonication for 30 min, in order to achieve a homogeneous catalyst ink. The resulting catalyst ink was dropped onto the surface of a polished glassy carbon (GCE, 6 mm in diameter) electrode by using a micropipette tip and left to dry at room temperature. The catalyst (NiCo2O4-MCNTs hybrid or pristine NiCo2O4) loading in each of the GCE is 0.24 mg/cm2. Commercial benchmark RuO2 and 20 wt% Pt/C catalysts were used as a reference for evaluating the OER and HER performance of oxide composites.

 Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), cyclic voltammetry (CV) and chronoamperometry (CA) measurements were carried out in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were carried out at an applied potential of 1.49 V (vs. RHE) using a perturbation amplitude of 10 mV. All the experiments were performed at room temperature.

 All the potentials scale in this study was calibrated with respect to a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) by using the following equation: <sup>o</sup> E E 0.0591 pH E vs. RHE vs. SCE = + ×+ vs. SCE , where the value of <sup>o</sup> E *vs*. SCE was 0.2412 (vs. RHE) and pH <sup>=</sup> <sup>13</sup> for 0.1 M KOH. Overpotential (η) was calculated by the equation: <sup>η</sup>(V) = ERHE − 1.23 V. The Tafel plots were obtained from the LSV polarization curves by using the Tafel relation as *η* = *a* + *b* log *j*, where *j* and *b* indicates the current density and Tafel slope.

#### **Calculation of electrochemical parameters**

The detailed calculations of the mass activity (A g-1), specific activity (mA cm-2 ECSA), and turnover frequency (s-1) of the resulting electrode materials are as follows.

The mass activity of electrode materials can be obtained from the mass of an electrocatalyst loaded and the measured current density (mA cm-2 geo) at 1.60 V (vs. RHE) which as follows.

Mass activity = 
$$\frac{\text{current density at a fixed potential}}{\text{electrocatalyst loading}}$$

The specific activity was estimated by normalizing the current attained at a specific potential of 1.60 V (vs. RHE) with electrochemically active surface area, as given by following eqn.

Specific activity 
$$=$$
  $\frac{\text{observed current}}{\text{electrochemically active surface area}}$ 

The turnover frequency (TOF) typically denotes the number of oxygen molecules generated per active site in one second. The TOF value of the electrodes was estimated from the following eqn.

Turnover frequency (TOF) = 
$$\frac{J \times A}{4 \times F \times n}$$

where J (A cm-2) is current density corresponding to overpotential of 370 mV, A is the surface area of the working electrode (∼0.28 cm2), F is the Faraday constant (96485.3 C mol-1), and n is the number of moles of the metal atom on the working electrode.

# **Entry for the Table of Contents**

The hierarchical flower-like NiCo2O4 spinel material anchored on MCNTs by facile surfactant free hydrothermal process is an effective bifunctional electrocatalyst for OER and HER in an alkaline medium. The NiCo2O4-MCNTs hybrid electrode delivers extremely low overpotentials of 350 and 209 mV for OER and HER, respectively at a benchmark current density of 10 mA cm-2. Moreover, it also has a smaller Tafel slope and excellent durability than the solitary NiCo2O4 and MCNTs.

#### **ABSTRACT**

Electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) must be effective, inexpensive, and long-lasting if electrochemical water splitting technologies are to advance. In this study, screen-printed electrodes containing ZIF-67—a zirconium-based metalorganic framework (Zr-MOF) composed of trimesic acid, carbon quantum dots (CQDs), and graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs)—were created using a layer-by-layer modification process. Increased number of active sites, increased surface area, and improved electron transport were demonstrated in structural and electrochemical testing of hybrid electrocatalyst systems. In comparison to reported electrodes, the ZIF/MOF/GNP-modified screen-printed carbon electrode (SPCE) performed significantly better at OER, with a reduced overpotential of 280 mV at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> and a Tafel slope of 40 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) confirms a significant reduction in charge transfer resistance due to the improved interfacial conductivity. After 18 h of operation, the system displayed excellent performance with little drift, according to chromatopotentiometry testing. Because the MOF framework was made more conductive by the combined effects of conductive GNPs and CQDs, EIS revealed a reduction in charge transfer resistance. These findings suggest that a hybrid system consisting of ZIF, MOF, and GNP might be an effective electrocatalyst for cost-effective, scalable, and environmentally friendly water splitting applications. They additionally demonstrate that this SPCE-based layer modification method may be utilized for extensive, cost-effective water-splitting applications.

## 1 | Introduction

In recent years, with the growth of the global population and the development of industry, the demand for energy is increased. With the depletion of traditional fossil energy accompanied by severe climate deterioration, the development of clean and sustainable energy becomes increasingly urgent. Judging from the experience of global clean energy development, hydrogen has been recognized as an integral part of clean and safe energy systems. Since 2017, the International Hydrogen Commission has

been advocating the importance of hydrogen energy in accelerating global energy transformation and tackling climate change. As a rich and environmentally friendly form of energy, hydrogen can be produced from a wealth of reactants on Earth and will not emit carbon dioxide or other toxic products when converted into other forms of energy. In addition, compared with other energy sources such as gasoline and coal, hydrogen has the highest energy density, laying the foundation for its efficient utilization [1]. A green and sustainable supply of hydrogen energy is crucial to the development of a hydrogen economy [2]. Water

electrolysis, steam-methane reforming, and coal gasification are the three current industrial methods for producing hydrogen. Both of the first two approaches produce significant quantities of carbon dioxide and utilize a lot of fossil fuels, which contribute to global warming. Electrochemical water splitting is a promising future technology for producing hydrogen because of its small size, high efficiency in producing hydrogen, and high efficiency in converting energy. Water splitting produces only oxygen and hydrogen, with no byproducts of carbon dioxide or other pollutants [[3](#page-9-0)]. Despite this, electrochemical water splitting only accounts for 3–5% of the hydrogen generated by industrial processes right now. The primary source of energy is the reaction known as water electrolysis [[4](#page-9-0)]. During electrochemical water splitting, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) happen simultaneously. Low energy conversion efficiency is a consequence of both reactions having to overcome high energy barriers. In comparison to OER, HER is both faster and simpler since it only involves a two-electron transfer reaction. Since OER is a four-electron oxidation, a stronger overpotential is necessary for the reaction. The breakdown of OH bonds and the establishment of O-O bonds on the surface of the electrode are the primary steps in the OER process. The total water splitting rate is controlled by the slow kinetic process. Consequently, a significant area of focus in water splitting research is the creation of stable and efficient electrocatalysts. Research into effective OER electrocatalysts has focused on enhancing kinetics and long-term stability while simultaneously decreasing OER overpotentials in various electrolyte conditions [[5\]](#page-9-0).

The main goal in the science of water splitting is now to make electrocatalysts that are cheap, work well, and last a long time. This is because slow OER kinetics are a problem. IrO2 and RuO2 are examples of precious metal-based compounds that are considered to be the best OER catalysts since they are very active and stable. However, their high cost and limited availability make it very hard to use them in large-scale commercial settings [[6](#page-9-0), [7\]](#page-9-0). This means that we need to look for other materials that have similar properties and are more readily available.

Nanostructured materials, especially those made from transition metals, metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), and carbon-based composites, have gained a lot of interest in the last few years because they could improve catalytic efficiency, conductivity, and surface-active sites. Zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs), a kind of MOF, and carbon materials with heteroatoms added to them are two of the most attractive possibilities for next-generation OER electrocatalysts because their porosity can be changed, they have a large surface area, and have a flexible structure.

Also, combining graphene-based materials like graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) with nanostructures made from MOFs can make hybrid systems that work together to increase electron transport, active site exposure, and overall electrochemical performance [\[8](#page-9-0)–[10\]](#page-9-0). Carbon quantum dots (CQDs) are an innovative category of zero-dimensional (0D) nanomaterials characterized by exceptional physicochemical features, including a substantial surface area, several surface functional groups, excellent water dispersibility, and tunable electrical characteristics. CQDs have been extensively researched for enhancing the conductivity and catalytic activity of hybrid electrocatalyst systems due to their distinctive structure and ease of functionalization. CQDs not only augment charge transfer efficiency when integrated with MOFs or carbon nanomaterials, but they also provide additional active sites, significantly enhancing electrocatalytic performance in water splitting and sensing applications. Layer-by-layer modification techniques that use these materials make it possible to precisely shape the electrode interface, which improves catalytic activity and long-term operational stability [\[11\]](#page-9-0).

In this study, we describe how to modify a screen-printed carbon electrode (SPCE) that has been changed using a systematic layerby-layer method that includes ZIF-67 (referred as ZIF in manuscript), a Zr-based MOF (referred as MOF in the manuscript) made from trimesic acid and CQDs, and GNPs. The goal of these components working together is to get beyond the kinetic limits of OER by giving it more active sites, better conductivity, and stronger structural stability. We tested the electrocatalytic performance of the fabricated electrode under alkaline conditions. This showed that it may be a cheap and scalable platform for efficient water splitting applications.

## 2 | Experimental Section

# 2.1 | Materials and Methods

Cobalt nitrate hexahydrate (Co(NO3)2·6H2O), 2-methylimidazole, zirconium chloride (ZrCl4), trimesic acid (benzene-1,3,5 tricarboxylic acid, BTC), citric acid, urea, ethanol, and other analytical grade reagents were purchased from Sigma–Aldrich and used without further purification. GNPs were procured commercially (Nanographi, Turkey, ≥99% purity). All aqueous solutions were prepared using deionized water.

## 2.2 | Instrumentation

Electrochemical measurements were conducted on a Versastat3 electrochemical interface potentiostat/galvanostat (USA) purchased from AMETEK. The bare SPCE, DRP-110 supplied by DropSens (Metrohm, Spain) were used as substrate for the modification of the working electrode, which had an internally integrated reference electrode and counter electrode, made from Ag and carbon, respectively. The diameter of the SPCE was 4 mm. SPCE was modified with ZIF, MOF, and CQDs.

## 2.3 | Preparation of ZIF, Zr- MOF and Carbon Quantum Dots (CQDs)

We synthesized ZIF-67 via a coprecipitation method at ambient temperature, as previously documented [\[12](#page-9-0)]. 50 mL of methanol (Solution A) was used to dissolve 2 millimoles of Co(NO3)2·6H2O, whilst 50 mL of methanol (Solution B) were employed to dissolve 16 millimoles of 2-methylimidazole. Solution A was rapidly introduced into Solution B while being continuously agitated. The mixture was continuously agitated at room temperature for 24 h. A centrifuge was employed to spin the purple precipitate at 4000 rpm for 10 min. Subsequently, we subjected it to three washes with methanol and dehydrated it under pressure at 60°C [[13\]](#page-9-0).

CQDs were synthesized using a hydrothermal method as documented in the literature [\[14\]](#page-9-0). 2 g of citric acid and 1 g of urea were dissolved in 30 mL of deionized water under vigorous agitation. The uniform solution was put into a 50 mL stainless steel autoclave lined with Teflon and heated to 180°C for 6 h. The product was filtered after cooling to room temperature, and the supernatant containing CQDs was collected. We further purified the CQDs by dialysis with deionized water and subsequently stored them at 4°C for future use.

Zirconium-based MOFs (Zr-MOFs) were synthesized from trimesic acid and CQDs using a solvothermal technique [\[15\]](#page-9-0). We combined 0.5 mmol of ZrCl4 and 0.5 mmol of trimesic acid (BTC) with 30 mL of ethanol. We employed ultrasonication for 30 min to amalgamate the aforementioned CQDs with 10 mL of ethanol. We gradually included the CQD dispersion into the ZrCl4/BTC solution while continuously stirring. The final mixture was placed in a Teflon-lined autoclave with a 50 mL capacity, sealed, and subjected to heating at 120°C for 12 h. The product was cooled to ambient temperature, subsequently centrifuged, washed with ethanol several times, and dried at 60°C. GNPs were dispersed in the water and that dispersion was used to drop cast on the electrode surface.

## 2.4 | Modification of Electrode

SPCE was modified with a layer-by-layer strategy. 10 μL suspensions of different modifiers were successfully deposited on the surface of the electrode in the form of layers. The hybrid ZIF-67/CQD/GNP-based SPCE was fabricated via a systematic layer-by-layer modification technique. The bare SPCE was cleansed and activated to eliminate surface impurities and enhance adhesion. A suspension of ZIF-67, a cobalt-based zeolitic imidazolate framework, was deposited onto the electrode surface via drop-casting. This created a conductive platform with extensive surface area. Following air drying, CQDs were uniformly distributed as the secondary layer to enhance the material's conductivity and increase the number of active sites. GNPs suspension was affixed to the changed surface by controlled deposition. This GNP will act as the primary catalytic layer for oxygen evolution. This hierarchical structure was designed to enhance OER activity and stability by optimizing electron transport, augmenting the availability of catalytic sites, and ensuring robust intercomponent interactions at the interface. Prior to conducting electrochemical experiments, the modified electrodes were stored in a desiccator (Scheme 1).

# 3 | Result and Discussion

## 3.1 | Characterization

The surface morphology and elemental composition of the synthesized materials were systematically investigated using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images in the upper row in Figure [1a](#page-3-0) depict the characteristic morphology of the synthesized ZIF-67 crystals. The distinct rhombic dodecahedral forms, characterized by smooth surfaces and uniformly sized particles, indicate that ZIF-67 was effectively synthesized by the meticulous coordination of cobalt ions with 2-methylimidazole. These findings align with the prevailing literature about ZIF-67 [[16,](#page-9-0) [17](#page-9-0)]. The SEM images in the second and third rows (Figure [1b,c\)](#page-3-0) illustrate the morphological alterations that occur as additional functional components are sequentially included. The incorporation of the Zr-MOF, synthesized from trimesic acid and alcohol, results in rod- and plate-like structures. These structures provide the network an extensive surface area [[18](#page-9-0)]. The uniform distribution of tiny spherical nanoparticles throughout the MOF surface indicates that the Zr-MOF has been effectively adorned with CQDs. The diminutive size of these CQDs results in increased surface roughness and a multitude of active sites, which is advantageous for electrocatalytic applications. The final row of SEM images (Figure [1d](#page-3-0)) displays the completed only CQDs. GNPs provide an interconnected network that facilitates electrical conductivity. The composite possesses a dense, porous architecture that ensures efficient mass transport and electron transfer pathways, which are crucial for electrochemical performance.

The uniform distribution of Zr, C, Co, and O across the composite surface confirms the successful layer-by-layer assembly strategy. The simultaneous presence of ZIF-67 (Co), Zr-MOF (Zr), CQDs (C), and GNPs (C) (Figure [1e](#page-3-0)–i) is consistent with the intended design of the multifunctional hybrid electrode material. Such homogeneity ensures optimal synergistic interactions

between the components, improving the composite's electrochemical stability, conductivity, and catalytic efficiency. The Co mapping signal is comparatively weak because EDX elemental mapping relies on the predominance of light elements (C, N) in the signal, while transition metals such as Co constitute a minor fraction. The EDX quantification results (Table S1) indicate that cobalt is present at a weight percentage of 12.41% (atomic % 3.17%), confirming its successful incorporation into

the composite. The subtle yet uniformly distributed red regions on the EDX map indicate that Co is consistently dispersed throughout the sample.

Figure 2a represents the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectra of different modifiers. The peak that is observed at approximately 3400 cm−<sup>1</sup> is thought to be the result of vibrations caused by stretching between aromatic rings. For the imidazole

ring, the stretching vibrations were also seen in the same spectra at 1418 and  $1579\,\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ . The imidazole batch's bending and stretching vibrational modes caused the peaks in the 600 to  $1500\,\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$  area. The peak at  $755\,\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$  showed the imidazole group's out-of-plane bending vibrations, whereas the peak at  $1000-1300\,\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$  showed the in-plane bending vibrations. The stretching vibrations of the C—H bond associated with the nonaromatic (aliphatic) methyl group were shown by the peak at  $2919\,\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ . At  $3132\,\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ , the aromatic ring's stretching vibrations in the imidazole group reached their apex.

For quantum dots at 3430 cm<sup>-1</sup>, a large peak was noted that corresponded to -NH<sub>2</sub> stretching. This peak originated from the doping of nitrogen atoms from urea. Indicating the presence of the carboxyl group, a stretching vibration peak was seen in the region of 3300–2500 cm<sup>-1</sup>. At around 3190 cm<sup>-1</sup>, the vibration that corresponds to the O—H stretching frequency was detected. At around 2158 cm<sup>-1</sup>, a band indicating the C—H stretching frequency emerged in the 2000–2500 cm<sup>-1</sup> region at 2201 cm<sup>-1</sup>. The free carboxyl group's C=O stretching frequency was found at 1570 cm<sup>-1</sup>. We attribute the stretching peak at 1400 cm<sup>-1</sup> to the C=C frequency. The existence of C—O was indicated by a distinctive peak in the 1078 cm<sup>-1</sup> range [19–21]. In Zr MOF, C—N stretching vibration appears at 1260 cm<sup>-1</sup>. The band at 745 cm<sup>-1</sup> is attributed to stretching vibrations of O—H.

Figure 2B represents the X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra of all modifiers. Upon synthesizing the Zr-MOF using BTC and CQDs, we observed several low-angle diffraction peaks. The (111) reflection plane of the MOF structure has a distinct peak at around 7.3° (2θ), indicating the formation of an ordered porous framework [22]. Additional reflections at around 8.5° and 17°–18° originate from higher-order planes inside the framework. A significant peak between 22° and 25° coincides with the characteristic signal of the CQDs, indicating their effective incorporation into the MOF matrix. The distinct MOF peaks and the graphitic characteristics of the CQDs indicate that the CQDs were successfully included without significantly compromising the crystalline structure of the Zr-MOF. The structural features should enhance the conductivity of the hybrid electrode material, increase its surface area, and provide additional active sites [23].

The broad (002) peak of CQDs is derived from graphitic domains that are organized at short distances. Since CQDs are so small (often less than 10 nm) and have so many surface flaws, their peak is far broader than graphene's or graphite's. The exact peak location could shift slightly depending on the material's production process, doping, or surface passivation [24].

The peaks of CQDs that include a large number of crystals may seem more pointed, although in reality, CQDs typically exhibit wide humps rather than pointed crystalline peaks.

The (002) reflection at approximately 26.4° is the most prominent and typical for GNPs and multilayer graphene. It indicates the interlayer spacing (about 0.34 nm, which is typical for graphitic materials). The peak's breadth or sharpness may indicate the material's crystallinity or the number of graphene layers present. The (002) peak for few-layer GNPs may have a broader and somewhat off-center profile in comparison to highly crystalline graphite [25].

Figure S1A XRD to confirm that the layers assembled on the SPCE surface were crystalline. The enhanced SPCE exhibits an XRD pattern characterized by numerous sharp peaks. This indicates that ZIF-67, Zr-MOF, CQDs, and GNPs were effectively sequentially deposited. The peak at approximately 26° (2 $\theta$ ) corresponds to the (002) plane of graphene, indicating the incorporation of GNPs. The peaks at 35° and 52° correspond to the (110) and (102) planes of ZIF-67, indicating the presence of this MOF. The peak at around 43.4° corresponds to the (100) plane of ZIF-67, reinforcing the evidence of its presence in the composite. The peak at around 57.5° indicates that ZIF-67 possesses a crystalline structure. The peak at around 76° corresponds to the (224) plane of ZIF-67, indicating a significant crystalline presence in the MOF. The broad peak between 20° and 25° indicates the presence of CQDs, signifying their composition of amorphous or nanoscale carbon. The comprehensive XRD pattern indicates that ZIF-67, Zr-MOF, CQDs, and GNPs were effectively deposited onto the SPCE sequentially, preserving the integrity of each component's structure [26-29].

Figure S1B represents the FTIR spectrum of modified SPCE. The subtle signal at 1364 cm<sup>-1</sup> primarily arises from the symmetric stretching vibration of carboxylate groups (COO-) within the Zr-MOF linker. This indicates that organic ligands are coupled to the Zr-oxo clusters. This band may also encompass minor contributions from the C-N stretching of the imidazole rings in ZIF-67 and the oxygenated functional groups of the CQDs. This further substantiates the effective incorporation of the hybrid components into the electrode architecture. A broad band centered about 998 cm<sup>-1</sup> was observed in the FTIR spectrum of the modified SPCE. This peak arises from the combined contributions of metal-oxygen vibrations from the Zr-O clusters in the Zr-MOF and the C-O stretching modes of oxygen-containing functional groups in the CQDs and partially oxidized GNPs. The extent of this characteristic indicates the presence of several coordinating environments, including Zr-O-C/Zr-O-Zr linkages and C-O-C/C-O-H groups. This aligns with the layerby-layer construction technique employed. The existence of this band strongly indicates that the Zr-MOF scaffold and the oxygenenriched CQDs/GNPs network have been well integrated. Collectively, they enhance the electrode's hydrophilicity and augment its capacity to facilitate charge transfer at the interface, which is advantageous for the OER. The peaks at 1973–2277 cm<sup>-1</sup> are insignificant for structural assignment; they merely represent faint overtones or combination bands of the organic linkers (imidazole/carboxylates). The 2364 cm<sup>-1</sup> broad band is an atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> artifact frequently observed in FTIR spectra [30-33].

We evaluated the modified SPCE's surface morphology using FESEM at various magnifications (Figure S1C). The electrode surface showed a rough, porous nanostructure with homogeneous aggregates at high magnifications (50.0 k  $\times$ , 100 nm scale), confirming effective immobilization of ZIF-67 nanocrystals and CQDs on the GNP/Zr-MOF scaffold. The nanoscale voids and granular characteristics are expected to increase the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA), accelerating the OER. A homogeneous coating was detected on the SPCE surface at a lower magnification (5.0k  $\times$ , 1  $\mu m$  scale). This coating has porous clusters and sheet-like features. This morphology shows that GNPs and Zr-MOF work well together. Conductive and porous Zr-MOF is ideal for improved deposition. Complete film coverage

<span id="page-5-0"></span>of the electrode surface, without bare carbon patches, shows strong nanocomposite layer adherence. The mid-range photos (5.0k ×, 1 µm scale) showed connected flakes and cracks. The solvent may have evaporated during drop-casting. The uneven edges and interfaces give ZIF-67 several growth sites, improving electrode stability. A moderate magnification (20.0 k ×, 200 nm scale) revealed homogeneous granular nanostructures on the electrode surface. The effective layer-by-layer assembly of ZIF-67 nanocrystals across the Zr-MOF/CQDs/GNP framework prevents agglomeration and exposes catalytically active Co-N/C sites. FESEM tests show that the modified SPCE has a hierarchical nanostructure with multiscale porosity, efficient surface covering, and consistent nanomaterial distribution. Charge mobility, electroactive site density, and electrolyte accessibility should improve with this architectural design. All of these factors improve the electrode's OER electrocatalytic performance [34-37].

## 3.2 | Electrochemical Oxidation of Water

This work employed a sequential layer-by-layer electrode engineering technique to fabricate enhanced sSPCE that exhibit superior performance for the OER. The electrode design integrates cobalt-based ZIF-67, a zirconium MOF with quantum dots, and GNP to enhance catalytic performance, electrical conductivity, and electrochemical stability synergistically. We evaluated four

configurations: ZIF (specifically ZIF-67), ZIF/MOF, ZIF/MOF/ND (incorporating nanodiamonds (ND)), and ZIF/MOF/GNP (incorporating graphene nanoplatelets).

#### 3.2.1 | OER Activity and Electrode Performance

Figure 3A illustrates the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves for the different electrodes evaluated in a 1.0 M KOH electrolyte. The ZIF/MOF/GNP electrode demonstrates a significant enhancement in OER activity. It exhibits the lowest onset potential and a significantly reduced overpotential at the reference current density of 10 mA cm $^{-2}$ . The overpotential for ZIF/MOF/GNP is about 310 mV, superior to ZIF/MOF/ND ( $\approx \! 340 \, \text{mV}$ ), ZIF/MOF (approximately 370 mV), and pure ZIF (approximately 410 mV). The results demonstrate the significance of GNPs in facilitating charge transfer and enhancing the accessibility of active sites by augmenting surface area and optimizing electrical routes.

## 3.2.2 | OER Kinetics and Mechanistic Insights

Figure 3B illustrates the Tafel plots derived from the LSV curves. These figures elucidate the functionality of the catalyst. The ZIF/MOF/GNP electrode has the lowest Tafel slope of 40 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>, indicating expedited response rates and decreased energy barriers in the OER process. The Tafel slopes for the

FIGURE 3 | Electrochemical analysis of modified electrode displaying (A) LSV scans. (B) Tafel slopes. (C) Continuous chronopotentiometry scans to assess stability of modified sensor. (D) overpotential comparison of different modifiers at current densities of 10 and  $100 \, \text{mA/cm}^2$ .

<span id="page-6-0"></span>ZIF/MOF/ND, ZIF/MOF, and ZIF electrodes are 360, 64, and 828 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. The stratified, permeable architecture of GNPs facilitates rapid gas (O<sub>2</sub>) release and ion transport, which is crucial for maintaining robust OER activity. Depending on their dimensions and surface modifications, ND can increase packing density or render porosity less favorable, hence impeding diffusion and elevating the Tafel slopes. The significant reduction in Tafel slope for ZIF/MOF/GNP results from the synergistic effects of the conductive GNP network, the high-density active sites provided by ZIF-67, and the structural stability conferred by the zirconium MOF integrated with quantum dots.

#### 3.2.3 | Long Term Stability

Figure 3C illustrates that a chronopotentiometry test was conducted on the optimal electrode to evaluate its resilience to electrochemical stress. The examination endured for 18 h at a steady current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. The ZIF/MOF/GNP electrode maintains a consistent potential of around 1.63 V versus RHE (Reference Hydrogen Electrode) over extended durations, indicating its exceptional structural integrity and catalytic stability. The relative stability of the voltage over extended durations indicates that the layer-by-layer electrode assembly is robust, even under challenging OER conditions.

## 3.2.4 | Comparative Analysis of Electrode Parameters

Figure 3D presents an intersection of the overpotential and Tafel slope data. The ZIF/MOF/GNP electrode consistently outperforms the other combinations across both critical performance metrics. This demonstrates that using GNP as a conductive additive is effective. The ZIF/MOF/ND electrode exhibits superior performance compared to the ZIF/MOF electrode, indicating that while ND enhances structural integrity, it does not facilitate electron transport as well as GNP. These findings validate that the optimal structure for ZIF/MOF/GNP enhances catalytic efficiency by improving conductivity, revealing active areas, and accelerating reactions simultaneously.

## 3.2.5 | Electrochemical Surface Area (ECSA) Analysis

Figure 4A,B illustrate the electrochemical surface area (ECSA), a critical indicator of the accessible active surface area. The cyclic

voltmmetry (CV) curves for the ZIF/MOF/GNP electrode at various scan rates exhibit characteristic rectangular shapes with increasing capacitive currents. This indicates that charge storage is efficient and the electrochemical contact is well-established. Figure 4B illustrates a linear relationship between current density and scan rate. This indicates that C<sub>dl</sub> can be precisely approximated, which is the method by which the ECSA is determined. The ZIF/MOF/GNP electrode has the highest ECSA across all combinations, which correlates with its superior OER performance. The ZIF-67/MOF hybrid possesses a hierarchical porous architecture, while the GNP network features an extensive specific surface area. Collectively, these two factors enhance the availability of active sites and facilitate the diffusion of electrolytes. The combination of these properties, together with enhanced electrical pathways and structural stability, significantly contributes to the remarkable catalytic activity and durability.

The electrochemical results unequivocally demonstrate that the strategic integration of ZIF-67, a Zr-MOF, with quantum dots and GNPs has a synergistic effect that enhances both the intrinsic catalytic activity and the electrode's structure. The layer-by-layer assembly facilitates charge mobility, provides enough access to active sites, and ensures the electrode's stability over time. The ZIF/MOF/GNP/SPCE electrode is an excellent option for prolonged water oxidation applications.

EIS studies were conducted in a 1.0 M KOH electrolyte utilizing electrode materials at a voltage pertinent to OER region. Figure 5 illustrates the Nyquist plots for the unmodified SPCE and the modified ZIF/MOF/GNP/SPCE. A modified Randles equivalent circuit was employed to characterize the electrochemical response. It encompassed solution resistance (Rs), charge transfer resistance ( $R_{ct}$ ), double-layer capacitance ( $C_{dl}$ ), and Warburg impedance (W) to account for processes occurring during molecular movement. The unadorned SPCE exhibited a substantial semicircular region in the high-frequency spectrum, indicating that the charge transfer resistance  $(R_{ct})$  was around 1200  $\Omega$ .  $C_{\rm dl}$  value of the SPCE/ZIF-67/MOF/GNP electrode was 41.2 μFcm<sup>-2</sup>. This indicated that electron transmission was sluggish at the electrode-electrolyte contact. Upon sequentially altering the layers with ZIF, MOF, and GNP, the  $R_{\rm ct}$  decreased to around 300  $\Omega$ , indicating enhanced electrical conductivity and charge transfer at the interface. The significant reduction in

charge transfer resistance results from the synergistic influence of ZIF and a Zr-MOF, and conductive GNPs. Collectively, these materials generate numerous active sites, enhance interaction between the two substances, and improve routes for electron transport. The enhancement in charge transfer velocity at the interface directly results in improved electrocatalytic activity seen in OER tests. This demonstrates the potential use of the customized hybrid nanostructure for energy conversion Table 1.

To contextualize the capacitance-derived active areas, the slope of the charging current against scan rate (non-Faradaic region) was plotted in non-Faradaic region to determine the  $C_{dl}$ . Subsequently, ECSA assumes  $Cs = 40 \,\mu\text{F cm}^{-2}$   $Cs. 40 \,\mu\text{F cm}^{-2}$ . The SPCE/MOF sensor (slope =  $0.006 \,\mu\text{A}\cdot(\text{mV}\cdot\text{s}^{-1})^{-1}$ ) from figure S2 is associated with  $C_{dl} = 6.0 \,\mu\text{C}$  dl.  $6.0 \,\mu\text{F}$  with an eECSA of  $0.15 \,\text{cm}^2$ . The ZIF/MOF/ND composite (slope =  $0.0065 \,\mu\text{A}\cdot(\text{mV}\cdot\text{s}^{-1})^{-1}$ ) from figure S3 exhibits a  $C_{dl}$  value of 6.5, which is somewhat greater than the other two composites.  $\mu$  C dl  $\mu$  C dl C = 6.5  $\mu$ F and ECSA  $\approx$ 0.163 cm<sup>2</sup>. The incorporation of the ZIF-derived porous framework and ND enhancements is expected to enhance the surface area and conductivity by approximately 8.3%. This aligns with our expectations and elucidates the superior performance of the electrochemical reaction. From the slope of the charging current versus scan rate in the non-Faradaic region,  $C_{dl}$  For SPCE/MOF and ZIF/MOF/ND, the values were 6.0 and 6.5 µF, respectively. If Cs = 40,  $\mu F \cdot cm - 2C$  s. The ECSAs that go with this are 0.150 and 0.163 cm<sup>2</sup>.

We employed a water-displacement gas collection method to determine the Faradaic efficiency (FE) for the OER. The ZIF/MOF/GNP-modified SPCE (geometric area 0.071 cm²) was held galvanostatically at a current density of 10 mA·cm $^{-2}$  for a duration of 2.0 h (7200 s) in nitrogen-purged 1.0 M KOH at 25°C. A polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) tube transported the generated  $\rm O_2$  into an inverted 100 mL buret containing water. The volume of gas displaced was measured directly at the

conclusion of the experiment (V = 0.18 mL). We employed the ambient pressure ( $P_{atm} = 101325 Pa$ ), the water vapor pressure at  $25^{\circ}$ C ( $P_{H2O} = 3169 Pa$ ), and a negligible hydrostatic head correction ( $\rho$ gh  $\approx$  196 Pa for a 2 cm head) to calculate the adjusted gas pressure ( $P = P_{atm} - P_{H2O} - \rho gh$ ). We employed the ideal gas law to determine the quantity of moles of O2 produced in the experiment. Subsequently, we juxtaposed this with the theoretical quantity of  $O_2$  derived from Faraday's equation (Q/4F), where Q represents the total charge and F denotes the Faraday constant (96485 C mol<sup>-1</sup>). All published measures are findings from single trials; conducting repeat testing is recommended. The gas volume collected was 0.18 mL (recorded at 25°C) during a 2-hour chronoamperometry experiment at  $10 \text{ mA cm}^{-2}$  (I =  $7.10 \times 10^{-4} \text{ A}$ ;  $Q = 5.112 \,\mathrm{C}$ ). The experimental mole quantity of  $O_2$  was calculated using a corrected pressure of 97,960 Pa (101,325 - 3,169 -196 Pa) as follows:  $n_{O2}$ ,  $\exp = PVRT = 7.12 \times 10^{-6} n_{O2}$ . RT = PV  $7.12 \times 10^{-6}$  moles. The theoretical  $O_2$  generated from the transmitted charge is  $n_{O2}$ , th = Q4F = 1.3246 × 10<sup>-5</sup> $n_{O2}$ . This value is below the optimal level ( $\approx$ 100%), primarily due to experimental issues, such as a restricted electrode surface area, partial dissolution of O<sub>2</sub> in the electrolyte, adherence of bubbles to the electrode surface, and minor losses in the tubing or sealing. The sustained overpotential and Tafel slope observed in OER experiments indicate that the intrinsic catalytic performance is favorable. The diminished fuel efficiency is attributable to issues in gas collection rather than deficiencies in the electrocatalyst itself. Subsequent studies employing larger electrodes, improved sealing, or additional gas quantification techniques, such as gas chromatography, are expected to yield enhanced FE values [6, 38, 39].

#### 3.2.6 | Proposed OER Mechanism

The MOF/GNP combination renders the environment porous and conductive, facilitating the cycling of Co<sup>2+</sup>/Co<sup>3+</sup>/Co<sup>4+</sup> redox states. Incorporating quantum dots into the zirconium MOF matrix likely facilitates the distribution of active cobalt sites and enhances electron mobility. GNP, conversely, ensures rapid charge transfer at the electrode-electrolyte interface. The functionality of each component: ZIF-67 (a cobalt-based MOF) possesses several cobalt active sites distributed at the atomic scale. These sites are crucial for OER catalysis. Quantum dots in Zr-MOFs: These contribute to maintaining the structural stability of the framework, minimizing cobalt leaching, and increasing the number of defect sites beneficial for intermediate adsorption. GNPs enhance electrochemical activity by augmenting surface area, reducing overpotential, and accelerating reaction kinetics through improved electrical conductivity, diminished charge transfer resistance, and increased surface area. This collaborative mechanism elucidates the enhanced OER performance, evidenced by a reduced overpotential (about 310 mV at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>), an optimal Tafel slope (40 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>), and robust stability over 18 h. The proposed methodology aligns with existing literature on cobalt-based MOF composites; nevertheless, the enhanced hierarchical architecture and conductive matrix provide significant advantages in active site utilization and long-term durability. The Co-based centers are widely reported as highly active for OER in alkaline media. The zirconium metal-organic framework serves two functions: Structural Integrity: Zr<sup>4+</sup> centers establish a robust, chemically stable framework that safeguards the catalyst against degradation, preserving the active architecture over extended OER operation (as seen by stability in Figure 1C).

The quantum dots inside the MOF framework facilitate electronic interactions between cobalt and zirconium sites, altering the surrounding electronic environment. This has the potential to: Facilitate the movement of charge between Co active sites and the conductive matrix. Incorporate defect sites that facilitate intermediate adsorption, such as \*OH, \*O, or \*OOH species. May participate in detrimental reactions by stabilizing reaction intermediates. Zirconium has a pronounced affinity for hydroxide, perhaps facilitating the activation of water molecules and priming the surface for subsequent stages in the Co-centered OER process.

Contingent upon the type of quantum dots utilized in the MOF: They might incorporate surface imperfections and edge positions that function as additional active centers and facilitate rapid electron mobility via quantum confinement effects. The function of GNP is to, i) Provide enough surface area to enhance the ECSA (refer to Figure 4A,B) ii) Construct efficient networks for electron transport to enhance overall conductivity, iii) During OER, stabilize the composite structure with the application of voltage, and iv) Establish electron pathways between the cobalt sites and the carbon matrix to reduce the impedance of charge transfer [40–42].

The improved ZIF/MOF/GNP electrode exhibited a Tafel slope of 40 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>, indicating favorable kinetics for the oxygen evolution process. This performance surpasses that of several MOF-based or carbon-modified composites previously reported and approaches that of noble-metal catalysts. This demonstrates the synergistic effect of combining ZIF-67, Zr-MOF, CQDs, and GNPs. The integration enhances electron transport, active site accessibility, and catalytic effectiveness, indicating that this cost-effective approach might be utilized for large-scale

water-splitting applications. Table 2 displays the comparison between different electrocatalysts with respect to their key electrochemical performance parameters.

#### 4 | Conclusion

ZIF-67, Zr-MOF/CQDs, and GNPs were sequentially assembled on screen-printed electrodes to provide an innovative electrode architecture for OER applications. The improved ZIF/MOF/GNP electrode exhibits superior electrocatalytic activity, reduced overpotential, and enhanced stability compared to the individual components and binary composites. The superior performance results from the synergistic impacts of the porous MOF structure, conductive CQDs, and high-surface-area GNPs, which collectively boost the accessibility of active sites, improve charge transfer efficiency, and increase electrode stability. This research presents novel opportunities for integrating MOF-based nanostructures with carbon nanomaterials to develop efficient, scalable, and durable electrocatalysts for water-splitting technologies, therefore enhancing the practicality of hydrogen energy applications.

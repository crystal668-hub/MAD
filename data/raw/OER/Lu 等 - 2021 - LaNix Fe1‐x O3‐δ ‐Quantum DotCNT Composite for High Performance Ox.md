**Abstract:** Rational design of active and earth-abundant catalysts toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is of particular significance for archiving highly efficient water electrolysis. Herein, a series of perovskite oxide quantum dots with plentiful oxygen vacancies adhered on oxidized carbon nanotubes (LaNiXFe1-XO3-δ-QDs/CNTs) were fabricated by simple sol-gel and pyrolysis methods. The results indicate that the optimized LaNi0.3Fe0.7O2.759-QDs/CNTs sample with adjust crystal structure, proper ratio of Ni to Fe, and desirable oxygen vacancy concentration shows a low overpotential (0.34V at 10 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> ), a low Tafel slope (74 mV dec-1 ), and excellent stability when it was evaluated as OER electrocatalyst. This work will shed light on the development of precious-metal-free catalysts with promoted catalytic performance

### **Introduction**

An increase in aggravate greenhouse and environmental pollution needs to establish clean energy conversion and storage systems, specifically for fuel cells. For these techniques, oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a key part, [1] which, however, suffers from sluggish kinetics due to complex four-electron redox reaction and large O2-evolving overpotential.[2] To address these issues, exploring effective catalysts is particularly significant. Previous research has shown that iridium and ruthenium oxides (IrO<sup>2</sup> and RuO2) delivered efficient OER performance, but faced the terrestrial scarcity and high cost. Recently, researchers are shifting the focus toward transition metal compounds with nature abundance and low cost. On this occasion, perovskite oxides (ABO3) have stood out from these materials and received considerable attention as promising catalysts towards OER application.

In ABO3, metal A is a rare earth or alkaline earth element and B is a transition metal element, both of which hold compositional flexibility. [3] In addition, the unique 3d electronic structure in B site of perovskite structure can act as active sites for improving the performance.[4] When the electronic number on e<sup>g</sup> (dz<sup>2</sup> , dx<sup>2</sup> -y 2 ) is 1, the catalyst shows the optimized electron configuration to improve the OER activity. For example, Du et al. synthesized Mndoped LaCoO<sup>3</sup> catalyst to efficiently optimize the E<sup>g</sup> orbit-filling structure of pristine LaCoO3. As expected, the obtained LaMn0.3Co0.7O<sup>3</sup> (E<sup>g</sup> filling number is close to 1) catalyst showed a lower OER overpotential of 416 mV compared with LaCoO<sup>3</sup> (480 mV).[5] Though much progress achieved, the performance still cannot meet the future requirements. Therefore, consideration is given to improve the OER activity of perovskite oxides. Quantum dots (QDs) as a novel kind of nanomaterial possess relatively large surface area and more exposed edge sites, [6] and are thus used to promote the mass and electron transfer and adsorb abundant OHin alkaline media, facilitating the corresponding electrocatalytic reaction. Therefore, QDs hold the potential to enhance the catalytic activity of catalysts.[7] On the other hand, the existence of oxygen vacancy in perovskite oxides is also beneficial for improved OER activity. For instance, the Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-δ with oxygen defects shows comparable OER activity to that of precious metal catalysts because oxygen vacancies were used as active sites to efficiently increase the OER activity by reducing the adsorption energy of H2O on the surface of catalysts.

In this work, a series of LaNixFe1-xO3-δ-QDs/CNTs composites with different oxygen vacancy concentrations were obtained by controlling the Ni-doping amount into the LaFeO<sup>3</sup> framework (Scheme 1). Among them, the S-30% (LaNi0.3Fe0.7O2.759- QDs/CNTs) with Ni doping amount of 30% reveals an outstanding OER performance than other samples, due to appropriate oxygen vacancy concentration for enhancing the kinetics in OER. [3, 4, 8] Because oxygen vacancy can tune the OER activity of LaNixFe1 <sup>x</sup>O3-δ, we then increased oxygen vacancy concentration of a series of as-prepared samples through calcining samples in mixed atmosphere of nitrogen and hydrogen. Over again, the results indicate that moderate oxygen vacancy is conducive for

OER. Additionally, the small size of LaNi0.3Fe0.7O2.759-QDs offer high surface area and expose abundant active sites.[4] What's more, the synergistic effect between LaNi0.3Fe0.7O2.759-QDs and CNTs also facilitates the fast electron-transfer kinetics. [9] Taken together, our catalyst not only shows high OER performance but also reduces the cost. More importantly, the as-formed composites have achieved significant progress as catalysts for H2O oxidation. Looking forward, our findings could provide a new strategy to rationally design perovskite-type catalysts for various applications.

### **Results and Discussion**

#### **Structural and Morphological Characterization**

The X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique was firstly used to detect the phase composition and structure of LaNixFe1-xO3-δ-QDs/CNTs samples. Figure 1a shows that both pure CNTs and oxidized CNTs match well with the hexagonal graphite (JCPDS Card No 1-0640). The diffraction peaks at 2θ = 25.8° and 42.8° can be ascribed to (002) and (110) planes of graphite, respectively. The lower peak intensities for oxidized CNTs than that of CNTs are probably ascribed to the oxygen-containing groups from destroyed surface of CNTs. No obvious diffraction peaks are observed for LaNixFe1-xO3-δ-QDs due to the low loading amount of LaNixFe1-xO3-δ-QDs (theoretical amount of 3.332 mg) on oxidized CNTs (Figure 1b) and the QD structure of LaNixFe1-xO3-δ. Considering that LaNixFe1-xO3-δ-QDs/CNTs was prepared under the same condition with LaFeO<sup>3</sup> perovskite oxide, the XRD pattern of pure LaFeO<sup>3</sup> was thus detected, as shown in Figure 1c. As can be seen, all diffraction peaks can be ascribed to the pure LaFeO<sup>3</sup> perovskite oxide (JCPDS Card No. 37-1493) with orthorhombic structure.

To further confirm the surface chemical state and composition of LaNixFe1-xO3-δ-QDs/CNTs, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed. We here take an optimized S-30% (LaNi0.3Fe0.7O2.759-QDs/CNTs) as a typical example. The full spectrum indicates that all La, O, Fe, Ni, C elements are existed in as-obtained sample (Figure S1a). The fine peaks of La 3d3/2 located at 856.2 eV and 851.8 eV, La 3d5/2 at 839.5 eV and 835.1 eV in La 3d indicate the presence of La with a valence state of +3 (Figure 1d).[11] In high-resolution spectrum of Ni 2p (Figure 1e), the Ni 2p2/3 spin-orbit can be deconvolved into two peaks at 852.6 eV and 856.2 eV and a satellite peak at 860.9 eV, assigning to Ni2+ and Ni3+, respectively.[12] The Ni 2p1/2 spectrum exhibits peaks at binding energies of 872.3 and 874.1 eV, also corresponding to typical Ni2+ and Ni3+, respectively.[13] The presence of mixed Ni2+/Ni3+ could be the reason of oxygen vacancy formation on the surface of sample. [14] For the high-resolution Fe 2p spectrum, the divided peaks at 711.2 and 724.6 eV along with corresponding satellite peaks at 718.0 and 732.0 eV verify the existence of Fe with a valance state of +3 (Figure S1b).[15] The multiple peaks of C 1s located at 284.6, 285.4, 287.3 and 290.6 eV can be assigned to sp<sup>2</sup> -hybridized CNTs (C=C) and oxidized species (C-O, C=O, and O= C-O)[16] , as shown in Figure S1c. For O 1s spectrum, the four peaks with binding energies located at 530.4, 531.2, 532.1 and 533.6 eV are ascribed to lattice oxygen (O1),[17] oxygen vacancy (O2),[18] hydroxyl groups or the surface adsorbed oxygen (O3), and adsorbed molecular water (O4),[16] respectively (Figure 1f). As far as we know, oxygen vacancies are favorable reaction sites to boost the catalytic activity in OER.[19] Therefore, the amount of oxygen vacancy and the oxidation state of B site are determined by iodometric titration. (Table S1).

The XPS spectra of S-30% (LaNi0.3Fe0.7O2.759-QDs/CNTs): (d) La 3d; (e) Ni 2p; (f) O 1s.

Subsequently, the typical morphology, microstructure, and particles size of S-30% sample were examined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As seen in Figure 2a-b, LaNi0.3Fe0.7O2.759-QDs are uniformly grown on the surface of CNTs substrates, and corresponding size distribution range of LaNi0.3Fe0.7O2.759-QDs indicates the average size is 2.35-3.25 nm (inset in Figure 2b). Figure 2c-d shows the high-resolution TEM images of S-30% sample, and it can be found that the lattice

spacing of 1.1840 Å corresponds to (422) plane of LaFeO3. In addition, the elemental mapping results reveal that La, Ni, Fe and O elements are existed and homogeneously distributed in the entire sample, demonstrating the successful preparation of LaNi0.3Fe0.7O2.579-QDs loaded on the surface of CNTs (Figure 2e). N<sup>2</sup> adsorption-desorption isotherms were adopted to examine the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area and porous structure of as-formed samples (Figure S5). As seen, S-10%, S-30%, and S-50% samples exhibit larger surface areas than that of pure CNTs (122.43, 134.71, 142.37, and 85.92 m<sup>2</sup> /g), which are closely related to the inherent structure of QDs. Meanwhile, the pore size distribution curve shows that the as-obtained samples display a typical mesoporous characteristic and the optimized S-30% shows an average pore size range from 4.5 to 50 nm. The large surface area and mesoporous structure can maximize the catalytic sites, and be essential to adsorption and activation of reactive molecules, facilitating the diffusion of electrons and reactants for promoted OER performance.

Figure 3a represents the Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra of oxidized CNTs, LaFeO3, S-0% and S-30% samples in the wavenumber range of 400-4000 cm-1 . Broad absorption band at 3446 cm-1 is attributed to the stretching vibration of O-H from hydroxyl groups.[21] The characteristic stretching vibrational peaks of -C=O, -COO-H and -C-O bonds at 1716 cm-1 , 1392 cm-1 and 1187 cm-1 can be ascribed to carbonyl and carboxylic groups.[17], [22] The peak at 1578 cm-1 is a typical -C=C stretching of CNTs. The above results demonstrate that the abundant oxygencontaining groups are generated by acid treatment, which can coordinate with Ni2+/Fe3+ and La3+ ions. Afterwards, LaNixFe1-xO3 <sup>δ</sup>-QDs were commonly grown on the surface of CNTs by calcination in the secondary phase. In FT-IR spectra of samples, a small peak appeared at around 1627 cm-1 corresponds to the O-H deformation vibration of absorbed water molecule of samples. Except for the characteristic peak of oxidized CNTs, the characteristic peak of LaFeO<sup>3</sup> perovskite oxide is also found at 589 cm-1 [23] Meanwhile, no significant characteristic peak of -C=O is found at 1712 cm-1 for both S-0% and S-30%, which may be ascribed to the reason that the -C=O bond was broken during the calcination process.

Raman spectra of oxidized CNTs and S-30% were shown in Figure 3b, clearly displaying the typical D and G peaks located at 1288 cm-1 and 1596 cm-1 , respectively. The D band represents disordered structure of sp<sup>2</sup> -hybridized carbon (C=C) caused by defects, occurring at graphite plane edges, vacancy, functionalities, etc., [24] while the G band is attributed to sp<sup>3</sup> of carbon atomic (C-C).[25] The ID/I<sup>G</sup> value is used to evaluate the defect and disorder degree of carbon material, and S-30% exhibits much higher ID/I<sup>G</sup> value (1.97) than that of oxidized CNTs (1.5), which is due to the increased defects in the structure caused by the introduction of LaNi0.3Fe0.7O2.759-QDs on CNTs.

#### **Oxygen Evolution Reaction Performance**

To evaluate the OER activities of as-formed catalysts, the electrocatalysis measurements were conducted with a standard three-electrode system in 1.0 M KOH solution. Figure S2a displays linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves of catalysts. It can be found that S-0% sample achieves an overpotential of 430 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm-2 , which is lower than that of CNTs and LaFeO<sup>3</sup> perovskite oxide, indicating better OER performance of LaNixFe1-xO3-δ-QDs/CNTs. During the electrochemical process, the nanotube structure of CNTs provides a channel to facilitate the fast electron transfer, therefore promoting the reaction kinetics of LaNixFe1-xO3-δ-QDs/CNTs catalysts. In addition, the LSV curves of a series of LaNixFe1-xO3 <sup>δ</sup>-QDs/CNTs with different contents of Ni dopant were also tested and the results are shown in Figure 4a. The S-30% has a lower overpotential (340 mV) than that of S-10% (410 mV), S-20% (370 mV), S-40% (390 mV), S-50% (440 mV), and S-100% (610 mV). From the LSV curves, it can be seen that S-30% exhibits the earlier onset potential (~1.5 V) and larger current density compared with other samples (Figure S2b), indicating its superior OER activity. Figure 4b gives a direct histogram comparison of the activity for obtained electrodes, and it is obviously found that the OER performance increases initially and then becomes downhill with increasing Ni dopant concentration, and the S-30% exhibits superior activity. Subsequently, Tafel slopes from the polarization curves of LaNiXFe1-XO3-δ-QDs/CNTs were obtained to further identify the electrocatalytic activity. As can be seen in Figure 4c, S-30% sample also delivers smaller Tafel slope of 74 mV dec-1 than that of S-20% (94 mV dec-1 ), S-40% (98 mV dec-1 ), S-10% (117 mV dec-1 ), S-0% (143 mV dec-1 ), and S-50% (192 mV dec-1 ). Manifesting S-30% much higher reaction kinetics of S-30%. [26] In addition, the electrocatalytic performance of asobtained S-30% sample is superior to those precious-metalbased (IrO<sup>2</sup> and RuO2) and perovskite oxide catalysts reported in literatures (Table S2). To further verify the excellent OER

performance of catalysts, the Nyquist plots of a series of LaNixFe1 <sup>x</sup>O3-δ-QDs/CNTs samples were shown in Figure 4d. Normally, the curve contains three parts including a charge transfer resistance (Rbulk + Ra), a double layer capacitance (Cdl), and an adsorption pseudocapacitor (Ca).[27] The electrolyte resistance R<sup>s</sup> was almost constant. The high-frequency region represents Rbulk and Cdl, while the low-frequency region represents R<sup>a</sup> and Ca. Obviously, the S-30% shows a much smaller charge transfer resistance, indicating its faster charge transport at the electrode interface and satisfactory electrical conductivity. Compared with other catalysts, S-30% sample also shows the lowest charge transfer resistance of 50 Ω, further verifying its excellent chargetransfer capability. Good conductivity is also essential to achieve the highly catalytic performance of a catalyst, which contributes to the efficient energy conversion efficiency.[28] Therefore, we calculated the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) from the electrochemical double-layer capacitance (Figure 4e).[26] The Cdl can be obtained by the ∆J (= Janodic – Jcathodic) – scanning rate results according to their cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves (Figure S3). As shown in Figure 4e, S-30% shows the highest Cdl of 15 mF cm-2 , indicating that larger surface area and abundant active sites exist in sample, which could promote the highly-efficient adsorption and activation of the reactants. Then, the i-t curve of S-30% sample for OER was recorded in 1.0 M KOH condition, aiming at investigating its electrocatalytic stability, which is also a key factor for commercialized application. As shown in Figure 4f, the S-30% exhibits good catalytic durability. In addition, the

(a) LSV polarization curves measured at a scan rate of 10 mV s-1 in 1 M KOH solution of S-0% (LaFeO2.979/CNTs), S-10% (LaNi0.1Fe0.9O2.852- QDs/CNTs), S-20% (LaNi0.2Fe0.8O2.798-QDs/CNTs), S-30% (LaNi0.3Fe0.7O2.759- QDs/CNTs), S-40% (LaNi0.4Fe0.6O2.669-QDs/CNTs), S-50% (LaNi0.5Fe0.5O2.516- QDs/CNTs).

polarization curves of S-30% after 100, 500 and 1000 cycles were also tested (inset of Figure 4f), and the results are in agreement with the initial one, further confirming its good stability.

The electrocatalytic OER activity of as-obtained reductive samples were also evaluated by LSV, CV, and EIS tests. The LSV curves indicate that R-(S-20%) sample requires smaller overpotential of 345 mV to achieve highly-efficient electrocatalytic activity at a current density of 10 mA cm-2 compared with R-(S-0%), R-(S-10%), R-(S-30%), R-(S-40%) and R-(S-50%), which deliver the values of 390, 375.6, 355, 410 and 510 (Figure 5b), respectively (Figure 5a). To estimate the OER kinetics of these samples, their Tafel plots were shown in Figure 5c. The results show that R-(S-0%), R-(S-10%), R-(S-30%), R-(S-40%), and R- (S-50%) samples present Tafel slopes of 126, 123, 108, 131 and 135 mV dec-1 , respectively, while R-(S-20%) shows the smallest Tafel slope of 96 mV dec-1 , implying its fastest OER rate.

Additionally, the Nyquist plots of all samples are shown in Figure 5d, which show that the charge transfer resistance of R-(S – 20%) is smaller than that of other samples, indicating more favorable electron transfer at the electrode interface for R-(S – 20%) during the OER. As shown in Figure 5e, the Cdl of samples were measured by using a CV method to estimate the ECSA (Figure S4). It is found that the Cdl of R-(S-20%) electrode is the largest up to 19.7 mF cm-2 , indicating its enhanced active sites and promoted adsorption and activation of the reactant molecules,

thus giving rise to an improved activity and facilitated reaction kinetics.

The overpotential of non-reductive samples (S-0%, S-10%, S-20%, S-30%, S-40%, and S-50%) and reductive samples (R-(S-0%), R-(S-10%), R-(S-20%), R-(S-30%), R-(S-40%), and R-(S-50%).) were examined for comparison. As evidenced in Figure 5f, the OER performance of S-0%, S-10%, and S-20% are significantly enhanced with increasing the oxygen vacancy amount. By comparison, the OER activities of S-30%, S-40%, and S-50% decline as the oxygen vacancy concentration increases, indicating that oxygen vacancy concentration is a critical factor for catalytic performance, and only appropriate concentration of oxygen vacancy can efficiently enhance the OER activity. This may also explain why the overpotential of R-(S-20%) is still 5 mV greater than that of S-30%.

Combining the component and structural advantages, the excellent electrocatalysis performance could be ascribed to the following reasons: the first is its unique QDs structure and average particle size of 2.35~3.25 nm, because QDs structure reveals higher specific surface area, which favors exposing abundant active sites. The second is the optimal oxygen vacancy amount (δ=0.241) from the optimized ratio of Ni 30% to Fe 70% in perovskite framework. Oxygen vacancy is beneficial to reduce the coordination number of neighboring sites and generate dangling band, optimize electronic structures of catalysts, which could highlight the catalytic activity.

### **Conclusion**

In this work, a series of LaNixFe1-xO3-δ-QDs/CNTs catalysts were successfully prepared by sol-gel and pyrolysis methods. The structural characterization indicated that the moderate amount of oxygen vacancy in a catalyst fulfills with the aim of high performance. As expected, when evaluated as catalysts for OER, the optimized sample with 30% Ni doping possesses the preferred electrocatalytic performance for OER, in terms of lower overpotential, Tafel slope, and durable stability. The controllable strategy will provide a new route to design and synthesize perovskite quantum dot materials with oxygen vacancy for the application in renewable energy conversion and storage system.

### **Experimental Section**

#### **Preparation of oxidized carbon nanotubes**

In a typical process, the purchased MWCNTs (98% purity, 30 to 50 nm in diameter) were dipped in a mixture of HNO<sup>3</sup> and H2SO<sup>4</sup> (VHNO3 : VH2SO4 = 1 : 3) at room temperature for 12 h. Then, the oxidized CNTs were obtained by ultrasonic treatment and washed several times with deionized water followed by lyophilization.

#### **Synthesis of LaNixFe1-xO3-δ-QDs/CNTs composites**

A series of LaNixFe1-xO3-δ-QDs/CNTs samples were prepared by sol-gel and pyrolysis methods. Take the synthesis of LaNi0.3Fe0.7O2.759-QDs/CNTs as a typical example: firstly, metal precursors of La(NO3)3·XH2O (4.656 mg), Fe(NO)3·9H2O (4.084 mg) and Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (1.26 mg) were added to an aqueous solution containing 200 mg well-dispersed oxidized CNTs. Then, a certain amount of AC (11.5 mg) and EDTA (8 mg) (mAC : mEDTA : mMetal) were added to the above solution with vigorous stirring for 12 h and then stirred at 90 °C to obtain gelation. Finally, the dried gel precursor was calcined at 750 ℃ for 3 h under N2atmosphere with a ramping rate of 3 °C min-1 to obtain LaNi0.3Fe0.7O2.759-QDs/CNTs. By varying the Ni dopant (x = 0%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%) a series of LaNixFe1-xO3-δ-QDs/CNTs samples were prepared and denoted as S-0%, S-10%, S-20%, S-30%, S-40%, and S-50%, respectively. In addition, the as-prepared LaNixFe1-xO3-δ-QDs/CNTs were also pyrolyzed at 400 °C for1 h in a mixed atmosphere of 95% N<sup>2</sup> and 5% H2, and the obtained samples were marked as R-(S-0%), R-(S-10%), R-(S-20%), R-(S-30%), R-(S-40%), and R-(S-50%), respectively.

#### **Characterization**

The phase structures of as-prepared samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurement performed on a diffractometer (Rigaku D/max-2400/PC, Japan) with Cu Kα (λ = 0.15468 nm) as the radiation source. The morphologies and structures of samples were observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Oxygen-containing functional groups were detected by Fourier transform infrared spectra (FT-IR, FTS3000FX, America). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, AXIS) was chosen to detect the surface state of samples. Raman spectra (WITec alpha 300RA+, Germany) were used to identify the defects of materials. Oxygen non-stoichiometry and average valence states of positive ion in S-0%~100% were determined by iodometric titration method. In detail, a sufficient amount of KI was added into a 6.0 M HCl solution containing 10 mg sample, which was titrated with dilute standardized thiosulfate solution (S2O<sup>3</sup> 2- , 0.05 mol L-1 ) under N2gas to prevent the oxidation of Iions from KI. For each sample, the titration was repeated twice, oxygen vacancy was determined by the average amount of consumed thiosulfate solution.

#### **Electrocatalytic measurements**

The electrochemical measurements were performed in a three-electrode configuration via an electrochemical workstation (CHI 660E). The calibrated Ag/AgCl electrode and a graphite rod electrode were used as a reference electrode and the counter-electrode, respectively, and 1.0 M KOH was chosen as an electrolyte. To prepare the working electrode, the as-synthesized catalyst (10 mg) was dispersed in 1.0 mL of water-ethanol mixture (VH2O : VEtOH = 1 : 1) under ultrasonic treatment for 15 min to obtain a well-dispersed catalyst ink. After that, 3.0 µL of ink was dropped on the surface of clean glassy carbon electrode (GCE, 3.0 mm in diameter) to dry naturally. Subsequently, nafion solution (2.0 µL, 0.5 wt %) was drop-casted onto it and dried fully. All potentials were measured against Ag/AgCl reference electrode, and the value was corrected by Equations of Evs Ag/AgCl +0.059 \* pH and overpotential (η) = ERHE - 1.23 V. For linear scan voltammetry (LSV) curves measurements, the scan rate was 10 mV s-1 in the potential range of 0.0 to 1.0 V.

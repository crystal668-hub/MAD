**Abstract:** Trapping the active sites on the exterior surface of hollow supports can reduce mass transfer resistance and enhance atomic utilization. Herein, we report a facile chemical vapor deposition strategy to synthesize single-Ni atoms decorated hollow S/N-doped football-like carbon spheres (Ni SAs@S/N-FCS). Specifically, the CdS@3-aminophenol/formaldehyde is carbonized into S/N-FCS. The gas-migrated Ni species are anchored on the surface of S/N-FCS simultaneously, yielding Ni SAs@S/N-FCS. The obtained catalyst exhibits outstanding performance for alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with an overpotential of 249 mV at 10 mAcm <sup>2</sup> , a small Tafel slope of 56.5 mVdec <sup>1</sup> , and ultra-long stability up to 166 hours without obvious fading. Moreover, the potential-driven dynamic behaviors of Ni-N4 sites and the contribution of the S dopant at different locations in the matrix to the OER activity are revealed by the operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy and theoretical calculations, respectively.

*T*he design and synthesis of electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) from water are important for the development of advanced electrochemical devices for energy storage and conversion.[1–5] However, the high energy barriers associated with the multi-step proton-coupled electron transfer process pose a major drawback to kinetics, thus requiring a high overpotential to attain the desired current density.[6–8] So far, noble metal-based OER catalysts (e.g., IrO2 and RuO2) have been demonstrated to be benchmark materials, but their high cost and poor stability severely restrict their widespread use.[9–12] Therefore, the development of high-performance and cost-effective transition metal-based OER electrocatalysts is highly desired.

Single-atom catalysts (designated as SACs) featuring the maximum atomic utilization efficiency have become promising candidates for OER.[13–17] Despite encouraging progress, SACs still face numerous challenges, especially limited exposure to active centers and poor molecular accessibility.[18]

Specifically, these reported SACs are generally prepared by a bottom-up strategy, in which dilute metal ions are first adsorbed in defect-rich supports and then reduced into SACs.[19] However, these atomically dispersed metal atoms are most buried in the interior of the solid supports rather than scattered across the surface, leading to poor atomic utilization and unsatisfactory catalytic performance. To conquer these issues, directly anchoring metal sites onto the surface of hollow nanostructures would be a potential resolution. Furthermore, the highly exposed metal sites are beneficial for identifying the structural micro-variation of the metal centers and their underlying catalytic mechanism. Therefore, exploring novel strategies toward surface-exposed SACs is highly promising for maximizing performance but remains a challenge. On the other hand, heteroatom modification/functionalization has been verified to be a valid method for adjusting the electronic structure and surface properties of metal centers. For instance, Hou et al. reported that the well-dispersed SjNiN*<sup>x</sup>* species could serve as active electrocatalysts for OER by the synergistic interactions between doped S atoms and single-Ni atoms.[20] Therefore, integrating these considerations into one alliance may significantly contribute to the development of advanced SACs with boosted OER performance.

Herein, we develop a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) strategy for fabricating single-Ni atoms decorated hollow S/Ndoped football-like carbon spheres (designated as Ni SAs@S/ N-FCS) as promising electrocatalysts for OER. The synthetic process of Ni SAs@S/N-FCS is illustrated in Figure 1a. Starting from football-like CdS nanospheres (NSs), the 3 aminophenol/formaldehyde resin (3-AF) is first coated on the as-prepared CdS NSs to obtain core–shell CdS@3-AF NSs, which are further carbonized into S/N-FCS under a high temperature. The gas-migrated Ni species derived from NiCl2 are isolated and trapped on the exterior surface of the S/N-FCS matrix simultaneously, yielding the final Ni SAs@S/N-FCS. Benefiting from the abundantly surface-exposed single-Ni sites and hollow S/N-doped carbon structure, the resultant Ni SAs@S/N-FCS catalyst exhibits excellent OER performance with an overpotential of 249 mV at 10 mAcm <sup>2</sup> , a small Tafel slope of 56.5 mVdec <sup>1</sup> , and ultra-long stability up to 166 hours without obvious fading.

Field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) images show that as-formed CdS NSs are highly uniform with an average diameter of 210 nm (Figure S1, Supporting Information). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) im-

ages demonstrate the solid nature of CdS NSs (Figure S2, Supporting Information) and the core–shell structure of CdS@3-AF with the 3-AF shell thickness of about 20 nm (Figure 1b–d; Figure S3, Supporting Information). The energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis of the as-formed CdS NSs reveals that the atomic ratio of S and Cd is roughly 1:1, in line with the stoichiometric ratio in the CdS molecular formula (Figure S4a, Supporting Information). The signals of C, N, and O elements originating from the 3-AF shell can be easily detected in the as-prepared CdS@3-AF NSs (Figure S4b, Supporting Information). In addition, the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns (Figure S5, Supporting Information) demonstrate that all the diffraction peaks of CdS@3-AF can be perfectly matched with the well-crystallized CdS (JCPDS No. 41-1049). No obvious diffraction peaks of the 3- AF are observed, indicating the poor crystallization of the 3- AF layer.[21] The high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) and the corresponding elemental mapping images of an individual CdS@3- AF particle further reveal that the C, O, and N elements are homogeneously distributed over the whole nanostructure, while the S and Cd elements are mainly located in the core area (Figure 1e).

To prepare the Ni SAs@S/N-FCS in a green way, a homemade set-up (Figure S6, Supporting Information) is designed to collect the volatile species (Cd, S, Ni, etc.).[22] FESEM and HAADF-STEM images show that the asobtained Ni SAs@S/N-FCS catalyst well maintains the football-like morphology with a hollow interior (Figure 2a–e; Figure S7, Supporting Information). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) confirms that about 92.8% of the mass loss occurs from 30 to 1000°C in N2 (Figure S8, Supporting Information). The decomposition of the CdS template and the pyrolysis of 3-AF also result in a high Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area of 106.7 m2 g <sup>1</sup> for the as-prepared Ni SAs@S/N-FCS catalyst (Figure S9, Supporting Information). Aberration-corrected HAADF-STEM measurements are further conducted to identify the metal species within Ni SAs@S/N-FCS at the atomic scale. Figure 2f displays a lot of isolated bright dots (about 0.2 nm in diameter) trapped in the Ni SAs@S/N-FCS catalyst. The line intensity profiles further confirm that the adjacent Ni atoms marked by a green square in Figure 2f are all distributed in the isolated state (Figure S10, Supporting Information). Furthermore, by the advanced three-dimensional (3D) atom-overlapping Gaussian-function fitting mapping technique, the area marked by a green square in Figure 2f can be reconstructed into Figure 2g, in which the isolated metal atoms are singly trapped on the matrix of Ni SAs@S/N-FCS catalyst. More intuitively, the side view reveals that all metal atoms protrude from the matrix and are trapped on the surface (Figure 2h). The uniform distribution of C, N, S, and Ni elements in a single Ni SAs@S/N-FCS can be revealed by the HAADF-STEM and corresponding elemental mapping images (Figure 2i). Notably, the signals of Cd are not detected, suggesting that the Cd species are completely volatilized under pyrolysis. According to the above analysis, these bright dots are confirmed to be single-Ni atoms rather than Cd atoms. Inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) result shows that the Ni content in Ni SAs@S/N-FCS is about 1.1 wt% (Table S1, Supporting Information).

As a comparison, the Ni-free S/N-FCS support is easily prepared via the pyrolysis of CdS@3-AF NSs without adding NiCl<sub>2</sub> (Figure S11 and S12, Supporting Information). Ni SAs@S/N-FCS and S/N-FCS exhibit similar Raman spectra with typical D and G carbon bands (Figure S13, Supporting Information). [23] X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) technique is further used to analyze the chemical environments of elements. The XPS survey spectra show that an obvious peak of Ni can be observed in the sample of Ni SAs@S/N-FCS, indicating the Ni species are successfully migrated and trapped to the S/N-FCS support (Figure S14, Supporting Information). High-resolution Ni 2p<sub>3/2</sub> spectra in Figure 3a show that only an obvious peak located at around 854.1 eV can be found in Ni SAs@S/N-FCS. Moreover, this value of binding energy is between 853.0 eV of the reported  $Ni^0$  and 855.1 eV of  $Ni^{2+}$  ions, indicating the ionic  $Ni^{\delta+}$  (0<  $\delta$ <2) nature of the single-Ni sites in Ni SAs@S/N-FCS.<sup>[24]</sup> In addition, no observable Ni characteristic peaks are detected in the XRD patterns of Ni SAs@S/N-FCS and S/N-FCS, demonstrating the absence of crystalline Ni nanoparticles (Figure 3b).

To probe the intrinsic atomic structure of the as-formed Ni SAs@S/N-FCS catalyst, X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) measurements are conducted. As shown in Figure 3c,

over the whole range of 0 to 12.0 Å<sup>-1</sup>, the  $k^2\chi(k)$  oscillation curve of the Ni SAs@S/N-FCS catalyst at the Ni K-edge displays different trends in the oscillating frequency and shape from that of NiO and Ni foil. The result indicates that the coordination configuration of Ni atoms in the Ni SAs@S/N-FCS catalyst is quite different from that of NiO and Ni foil. [25-28] We further analyze the Fourier transform (FT) of extended X-ray absorption fine spectrum (EXAFS) of the Ni SAs@S/N-FCS catalyst at the Ni K-edge (Figure 3d). A dominant Ni-N peak located at around 1.4 Å can be observed in the FT EXAFS curve of Ni SAs@S/N-FCS, indicating the Ni atoms are bonded with N rather than S atoms. [29] Additionally, the absorption threshold of the Ni SAs@S/N-FCS at the Ni K-edge is situated between that of Ni foil and NiO, further confirming the intermediate valence state nature of single-Ni atoms (Figure S15, Supporting Information). These results are consistent with the above XPS results.

The EXAFS wavelet transform (WT) technique is another powerful tool for distinguishing backscattering atoms. Compared with the WT contour plots of Ni foil (Ni–Ni at about 7.3 Å<sup>-1</sup>) and NiO (Ni–Ni at about 6.6 Å<sup>-1</sup> and Ni–O at about 4.0 Å<sup>-1</sup>), only one peak assigned to the Ni–N scattering path (about 4.3 Å<sup>-1</sup>) is observed in the Ni SAs@S/N-FCS (Figure 3e), further verifying that the Ni sites are atomically

distributed.[30–33] The N *K*-edge X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectra (Figure S16, Supporting Information) of S/N-FCS and Ni SAs@S/N-FCS are further studied. Three signals, including the π\*-transition of the pyridinic-N (signal α) and graphitic-N (signal β), as well as the σ\* transition of C N bonds (signal γ), are identified in both samples. The only difference is that the signals derived from pyridinic-N are divided into two signals (α1 and α2) in the Ni SAs@S/N-FCS, manifesting that partial pyridinic-N sites are bonded with Ni sites.[34,35] These pyridinic-N sites could share partial p-electron to the adjoint p-conjugated system, thus

boosting the chemical stabilization of the trapped single-Ni sites. Finally, the EXAFS fitting results further uncover that the coordination number of the resultant single-Ni sites is about 4 (Figure S17; Table S2, Supporting Information).

The electrochemical OER measurements are tested in the alkaline solution to evaluate the electrocatalytic performance of the as-prepared Ni SAs@S/N-FCS catalyst with commercial RuO2, Ni NPs@S/N-FCS (the synthesis and characterization are provided in Figure S18–S21, Supporting Information), and Ni-free S/N-FCS as references.

observed that the Ni SAs@S/N-FCS catalyst shows the best activity toward OER over the measured potential range. Specifically, the Ni SAs@S/N-FCS catalyst requires only a small overpotential ( $\eta_{10}$ ) of 249 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> (Figure 4b), outperforming that of S/N-FCS (451 mV), Ni NPs@S/N-FCS (343 mV) and RuO<sub>2</sub> (372 mV). Also, the smallest Tafel slope of 56.5 mV dec<sup>-1</sup> is observed for the Ni SAs@S/N-FCS catalyst (Figure 4c), which surpasses that of Ni NPs@S/N-FCS (88.1 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>), Ni-free S/N-FCS  $(195 \text{ mV dec}^{-1})$ , and RuO<sub>2</sub>  $(103.6 \text{ mV dec}^{-1})$ . Additionally, a high turnover frequency (TOF) value of 0.88 s<sup>-1</sup> is achieved for the Ni SAs@S/N-FCS catalyst at the overpotential of 300 mV (Figure 4d), which is much higher than that of Ni NPs@S/N-FCS (0.013 s<sup>-1</sup>). It is noteworthy that the Ni-free S/ N-FCS catalyst exhibits poor OER performance relative to Ni SAs@S/N-FCS, which may suggest these surface-bound single-Ni sites are the dominant active centers. More importantly, the excellent OER performance of Ni SAs@S/N-FCS is comparable to the most reported transition metal-based OER catalysts (Table S3, Supporting Information).

The electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) of Ni SAs@S/N-FCS is further investigated by calculating the electrochemical double-layer capacitance  $(C_{\text{\tiny all}})$ . As expected, the Ni SAs@S/N-FCS catalyst possesses more available active sites with a C<sub>dl</sub> value of 2.63 mF cm<sup>-2</sup> (Figure 4e; Figure S22, Supporting Information), which is about 8.5 times that of Ni NPs@S/N-FCS (0.31 mFcm<sup>-2</sup>). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis reveals that the Ni SAs@S/N-FCS catalyst shows a smaller charge transfer resistance than Ni NPs@S/N-FCS and Ni-free S/N-FCS, indicating a faster charge-transfer process for Ni SAs@S/N- FCS during OER (Figure S23, Supporting Information), in line with the Tafel slope results. The Ni SAs@S/N-FCS catalyst displays outstanding OER durability, with a negligible increase in potential after a 166-h OER testing at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> (Figure 4f). However, the Ni NPs@S/N-FCS, Ni-free S/N-FCS, and commercial RuO2 electrocatalysts show significantly increased potential. LSV curves before and after the stability test also show a slight activity decay for the Ni SAs@S/N-FCS catalyst (Figure S24, Supporting Information). Furthermore, the position of the Ni 2p<sub>3/2</sub> peak remains almost unchanged after the stability test (Figure S25, Supporting Information). Besides, the morphology of the Ni SAs@S/N-FCS catalyst and isolated Ni sites can be preserved after the long-term OER operation (Figure S26-S28, Supporting Information).

To further trace the micro-variation of single-atom Ni sites in Ni SAs@S/N-FCS during OER, operando XANES spectra of the Ni SAs@S/N-FCS catalyst at the Ni K-edge are recorded under various applied potentials. Figure 5a shows a schematic of the electrochemical cell set-up employed for carrying out the operando XANES experiment. The microinterspace porous carbon cloth loaded with the catalyst is utilized as the working electrode. [39] As exhibited in Figure 5b, the absorption edge is slightly shifted to the higher energy when the applied potential is changed from the open circuit potential (OCP) condition up to 1.55 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (vs. RHE), manifesting an increase in the valance state of the Ni species. Moreover, the FT curves of operando EXAFS at the Ni K-edge (Figure 5c) reveal that the scattering path of the first coordination peak (Ni-N) slightly increased from 1.40 to 1.43 Å when the applied potential is changed from the OCP to 1.05 V vs. RHE, probably owing to

the adsorption of the water molecule from the electrolyte on the surface of single-Ni sites.[40] However, the bond length of Ni N bonds gradually decreases from 1.43 to 1.37 Å following the applied potential increase to 1.55 V vs. RHE, which is possibly ascribed to the formation of oxygenic intermediates (such as OOH\* or O2) on the surface of the single-atom Ni sites.[41] These observations suggest that the potential-driven structural micro-variation of single-Ni sites truly occurs under OER conditions, showing a dynamic catalytic center.[42]

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations are further performed for Ni SAs@S/N-FCS to rationalize the role of the doped S atoms in efficiently promoting the OER performance. Four possible calculated models for Ni SAs@S/N-FCS are created. The S atoms can be selectively modified on the armchair (AC) or zigzag (ZZ) sites around the graphenetrapped NiN4 sites (denoted as G-NiN4). Specifically, the Smodified G-NiN4 structures in the AC edge (ACG-NiN4-SC and ACG-NiN4-CS) and the S-modified G-NiN4 structures in the ZZ edge (ZZG-NiN4-SC and ZZG-NiN4-CS) are modeled for study (Figure S29, Supporting Information).[29,43] As a comparison, the G-NiN4 and Ni6 functioned S/N-doped graphene matrix (denoted as ACG-Ni6N4-SC) can be created and used as the models of S-free NiN4 and Ni NPs@S/N-FCS, respectively, to investigate the potential OER mechanism (Figure S30, Supporting Information). Figure 5d shows the free energy diagram of the above-mentioned six models. For ACG-Ni6N4-SC, the OOH\* dissociation process is the ratedetermining step (RDS), which needs to overcome a maximum reaction energy barrier of 2.00 eV. However, for G-NiN4, ZZG-NiN4-CS, ZZG-NiN4-SC, ACG-NiN4-CS, and ACG-NiN4-SC, the formation of \*O intermediate is the RDS, needing to overcome an energy barrier of 2.19, 1.95, 1.93, 1.91, and 1.81 eV, respectively. In addition, the G-NiN4 model functionalized by the S atom on the graphene basal plane is also considered (Figure S31, Supporting Information). The most stable G-NiN4-S1 model needs the RDS energy barrier of 2.71 eV to form \*OOH intermediates, which is significantly inferior to edge-modified catalysts (Figure S32, Supporting Information). These findings reveal that the ACG-NiN4-SC is favorable for the thermodynamic process for OER due to the lowest RDS energy barrier.[44,45]

Moreover, the Barde charge of the models as shown in Figure 5e indicates that the AC-edged models (ACG-NiN4-CS and ACG-NiN4-SC) possess a more positive charge than the ZZ-edged ones (ZZG-NiN4-C and ZZG-NiN4-SC) and the Sfree G-NiN4 model. More specifically, the Ni atom in the ACG-NiN4-SC model possesses a positive charge of +0.858e, which is larger than that of ACG-NiN4-CS (+0.851e). These findings indicate that a more positive charge of single-Ni sites could strengthen the adsorption of intermediates and thus boost the OER process. Charge density difference analysis of \*O intermediates on single-Ni sites in ACG-NiN4-SC, ZZG-NiN4-SC, and G-NiN4 is further performed. The top and side views of the ACG-NiN4-SC model (Figure 5f) exhibit a larger charge transfer (0.595e) from the Ni to O atoms, which is larger than that of ZZG-NiN4-SC (0.574e) and G-NiN4 (0.569e) (Figure S33, Supporting Information), indicating the strong electronic interactions between Ni and O atoms. In addition, the strong electronic coupling effect between the Ni 3d and O 2p orbitals for ACG-NiN4-SC is confirmed by the partial density of states (PDOS) calculations (Figure S34, Supporting Information). Collectively, the above results demonstrate that the surface-trapped single-Ni sites may be the real activity centers for OER and the possible OER catalytic mechanism is also proposed (Figure S35, Supporting Information), which is in line with some recent works.[46,47]

In summary, a high-efficiency OER catalyst has been developed by decorating single-Ni atoms on hollow S/N-doped football-like carbon spheres (Ni SAs@S/N-FCS). Benefiting from the abundantly surface-exposed single-Ni sites and hollow S/N-doped carbon structure, the resultant Ni SAs@S/ N-FCS electrocatalyst delivers excellent OER performance with an overpotential of 249 mV at 10 mAcm <sup>2</sup> , a Tafel slope of 56.5 mVdec <sup>1</sup> , and outstanding durability. Moreover, the potential-driven dynamic behaviors of active Ni-N4 sites and the contribution of S-dopant at different locations in the matrix to the OER activity are revealed by the operando Xray absorption spectroscopy and theoretical calculations, respectively. This work may offer some inspiration for designing and constructing surface-exposed SACs and revealing their potential-driven dynamic behaviors, thus promoting their widespread application in sustainable energy storage and conversion technologies.

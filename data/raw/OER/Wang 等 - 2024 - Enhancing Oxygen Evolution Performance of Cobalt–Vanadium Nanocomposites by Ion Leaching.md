# Enhancing Oxygen Evolution Performance of Cobalt-Vanadium Nanocomposites by Ion Leaching

Bingyu Wang, Ang Li, and Xiaowen Zhang\*

Co-based catalysts have been widely used in oxygen evolution reaction (OER) because of their low price and excellent catalytic performance. Herein, strategies of ion leaching and surface reconstruction to form more catalytic active sites are proposed, and accordingly improving the intrinsic activity of OER catalyst. First, the Co-metal-organic frameworks (MOFs)/Ni precursors are synthesized on Ni foam by hydrothermal method. Then, the second hydrothermal reaction is carried out in sodium metavanadate solution, and a highly active V-doped Co-MOFs/Ni OER catalyst with particle coating is obtained. The results show that V-doped Co-MOFs/Ni in 1 M KOH solution shows excellent performance, that is, low overpotential of 253 mV at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, Tafel slope of 56 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>, small charge transfer impedance, large electrochemically active area of 1.71 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>, and good stability. Inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry measurements confirm that the V ions play a dominant role in leaching, while the Co ions negligibly contribute to the leaching. This work paves an alternative approach for advancing the synthesis of high-efficiency nonprecious OER catalysts by such a facile green method.

#### 1. Introduction

As a green and sustainable energy carrier with high energy density, hydrogen has been regarded as the best alternative energy to replace fossil fuels. [1] At present, the commonly used hydrogen production technologies in the industry include methane steam reforming, coal gasification, and water electrolysis, which account for  $\approx$ 4% of the total production. [2,3] Coupled with available resources such as solar- or wind-derived electricity, water-splitting technology has attracted extensive attention due to its high energy conversion efficiency, negligible environmental pollution, and potentially wide range of applications. [4-6] Water electrolysis requires effective catalysts to facilitate the hydrogen evolution reaction at the cathode and the oxygen

evolution reaction (OER) at the anode. <sup>[7,8]</sup> The complex and kinetically sluggish OER plays a decisive role in controlling the energy efficiency of hydrogen production. Up to now, the OER catalysts are still dominated by precious metals such as Pt and RuO<sub>2</sub>/IrO<sub>2</sub>. However, their practical application is limited, owing to the low natural abundance, high cost, and unsatisfactory stability. <sup>[9]</sup> Here, nonprecious metalbased OER catalysts have gradually become a hot research field of which Co-based materials are always at the forefront. <sup>[10,11]</sup>

Many OER catalysts are prone to be inactivated in acids at high pH. Relatively speaking, electrolytic water in alkaline medium has less damage to the catalyst and more choices of catalysts, showing a brilliant prospect. [12]

The ion leaching effect has a certain impact on the oxygen evolution performance of nanocomposite materials, but

the ion leaching phenomenon in the pure phase oxygen evolution electrocatalyst will lead to the collapse and loss of the catalyst crystal matrix. [13] Yu et al. presented the atomic structure of the surface of spinel, revealing a new surface reconstruction mode and stabilization mechanism of the insulator surface. [14] Xu et al. prepared an efficient OER electrocatalyst by replacing part of Al in inert CoAl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> with Fe.<sup>[15]</sup> Fan et al. designed a layered hollow iron-vanadium composite material and this material showed an overpotential of 390 mV at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> in 1 M KOH.<sup>[16]</sup> Selomulya et al. reported a new class of OER precatalysts that can obtain species with high OER activity through selfreconstruction.<sup>[17]</sup> Yu et al. prepared amorphous NiFeMo oxide nanomaterials by codeposition of supersaturated solution at room temperature, and this material showed an overpotential of 280 mV at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> in 1 M KOH. [18] Hou et al. prepared a bimetallic oxide/sulfide heterojunction array by using the surface reconstruction strategy induced by oxidation/ hydrogenation. [19] Duan et al. proposed a new mechanism, which shows the importance of controlling anode potential in the surface chemistry of modified electrocatalysts.<sup>[20]</sup>

With the purpose of improving the intrinsic activity of OER catalyst and considering the nonprecious metal electrocatalyst with Co as raw material has high catalytic activity, herein we propose strategies of ion leaching and surface reconstruction with more catalytic active sites. Based on the Co-metal–organic frameworks (MOFs)/Ni precursors, the V-doped Co-MOFs/Ni oxygen evolution catalyst has been prepared and demonstrated excellent performance: low overpotential of 253 mV at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, Tafel

slope of  $56~\text{mV}\,\text{dec}^{-1}$ , small charge transfer impedance, large electrochemically active area of  $1.71~\text{mF}\,\text{cm}^{-2}$ , and good stability. Our experiments provide some new ideas for advancing nonprecious OER catalysts.

#### 2. Results and Discussion

To explore the structure and composition of a V-doped Co-MOFs/Ni oxygen evolution electrode, the prepared Co-MOFs/Ni precursor and V-doped Co-MOFs/Ni electrode are characterized by XRD, as shown in Figure 1. All Bragg peaks of the precursor Co-MOFs/Ni match well with  $\text{Co}_2(\text{OH})_2(\text{C}_8\text{H}_4\text{O}_4)$ . Our results show that the position of the diffraction peaks of the final V-doped Co-MOFs/Ni electrode is generally identical to those of the Co-MOFs/Ni precursor, except for a slight deviation. It proves that the doping of vanadium does not generate new phases, but slightly causes the lattice expansion, which also confirms the incorporation of V ions.

**Figure 1.** XRD profiles of Co-MOFs/Ni precursor, V-doped Co-MOFs/Ni electrode, and  $Co_2(OH)_2(C_8H_4O_4)$ .

Figure 2 shows the SEM images of the Co-MOFs/Ni precursor with different magnifications. A layer of aloe-like array structure is covered on the Ni foam substrate, and the catalyst surface is smooth. It is well known that the addition of sodium salicylate in the hydrothermal process of the first step could adjust the coordination environment, which improves the solubility of Co ion and tailors the surface morphology.

The effect of NaVO<sub>3</sub> solution concentration on catalyst morphology in the two-step hydrothermal process is investigated. Figure 3 shows the SEM images of Co-MOFs/Ni precursors after adding different concentrations of NaVO<sub>3</sub> solution (1, 3, 5 mm). NaVO3 is weakly alkaline in water. When the Co-MOFs/Ni precursor is immersed in NaVO<sub>3</sub> solution for hydrothermal reaction, the terephthalate ion is replaced by a hydroxide ion, which immediately causes a diffusion recombination to occur. When 1 mm of NaVO<sub>3</sub> solution is added, a particle coating phenomenon is observed on the surface of the Co-MOFs/Ni precursor (Figure 3a,b). The original morphology of the precursor is still maintained. With the increase of the concentration of NaVO<sub>3</sub> solution, the particles on the catalyst surface are gradually increased. For instance, when the concentration of NaVO3 solution is 3 mm, the particles are uniformly covered and dense (Figure 3c,d). However, higher concentrations of NaVO<sub>3</sub> solution (5 mm) produce a large pH value, accordingly resulting in the collapse of the original surface Co-MOFs/Ni precursor and a certain destruction of the morphology (Figure 3e,f).

**Figure 4** shows the electrochemical properties comparison of prepared V-doped Co-MOFs/Ni electrode and RuO<sub>2</sub>/Ni electrode. Figure 4a shows the LSV curves of Ni foam, RuO<sub>2</sub>/Ni, Co-MOFs/Ni, and V-doped Co-MOFs/Ni electrodes. The Ni foam behaves in the unsatisfactory activity of a high overpotential of 375 mV@10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. The Co-MOFs/Ni shows improved performance of 286 mV@10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, while the synthesized V-doped Co-MOFs/Ni behaves attractive low overpotential of 253 mV@10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. Although the activity of OER of V-doped Co-MOFs/Ni electrode is inferior to that of RuO<sub>2</sub>/Ni electrode (245 mV@10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>) at low potential, the activity of OER is explicitly superior to the RuO<sub>2</sub>/Ni at high potential. It can be seen from Figure 4b that the Tafel slope of the V-doped Co-MOFs/Ni

electrode is the smallest (56 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>), followed by the Tafel slope of 80 mV dec<sup>-1</sup> for the precious metal RuO<sub>2</sub>/Ni electrode. The Co-MOFs/Ni electrode and the Ni foam show higher Tafel slopes of 86 and 132 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. It is proven that the OER process on the surface of V-doped Co-MOFs/Ni catalyst has fast electrode kinetics. Figure 4c shows the Nyquist diagram of the corresponding electrodes. The Ni foam behaves the highest charge-transfer impedance due to its poor electrical conductivity, followed by the Co-MOFs/Ni electrode. The V-doped Co-MOFs/Ni electrode possesses the lowest charge-transfer impedance, which also manifests a rapid electron transport process between electrode and electrolyte during the OER. The impedance test results are consistent with the LSV curves.

Figure 5 shows the CV curves of Ni foam and Co-MOFs/Ni electrodes with 1, 3, and 5 mm NaVO $_3$  solutions. The possibility

of oxidation–reduction reaction at interfaces results in the CV diagram deviating from rectangle shape. Consequently, the shape of the CV curves reflects the capacitance characteristics of prepared materials. In comparison, the CV curve of Co-MOFs/Ni+3 mm NaVO<sub>3</sub> most approaches the rectangle, indicating the best capacitance property and stability.

**Figure 6**a shows the LSV curves of Co-MOFs/Ni electrodes with 1, 3, and 5 mm NaVO<sub>3</sub> solutions. The Co-MOFs/Ni + 3 mm NaVO<sub>3</sub> electrode shows the best activity with the lowest overpotential of 253 mV@10 mA cm $^{-2}$ . The overpotentials of Co-MOFs/Ni + 5 mm NaVO<sub>3</sub> and Co-MOFs/Ni + 1 mm NaVO<sub>3</sub> electrodes are 268 mV and 280 mV at 10 mA cm $^{-2}$ , respectively. Figure 6b shows the Tafel curves of the corresponding electrodes. The Co-MOFs/Ni + 3 mm NaVO<sub>3</sub> electrode shows the smallest Tafel slope of 56 mV dec $^{-1}$ , while those of

Co-MOFs/Ni + 5 mm NaVO<sub>3</sub> and Co-MOFs/Ni + 1 mm NaVO<sub>3</sub> electrodes have been increased to 65 and 96 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. In comparison with Co-MOFs/Ni + 5 mm NaVO<sub>3</sub> and Co-MOFs/Ni + 1 mm NaVO<sub>3</sub> electrodes, the Co-MOFs/ Ni + 3 mm NaVO<sub>3</sub> electrode also shows the smallest charge transfer impedance (Figure 6c). Figure 6d shows the corresponding double-layer capacitance curves. The Co-MOFs/Ni + 3 mm NaVO<sub>3</sub> electrode shows the largest electrochemical active area

of 1.71 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>, followed by Co-MOFs/Ni + 1 mm NaVO<sub>3</sub> electrode (1.34 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>), Ni foam (1.2 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>), and Co-MOFs/  $Ni + 5 \text{ mM NaVO}_3$  electrode (0.99 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>). As shown above, NaVO<sub>3</sub> has a considerable effect on the activity of Co-MOFs/ Ni electrodes. The Co-MOFs/Ni + 3 mm NaVO<sub>3</sub> electrode possesses the best catalytic activity and excellent intrinsic activity with the lowest overpotential of 253 mV@10 mA cm<sup>-1</sup> smallest Tafel slope of 56 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>, the smallest charge transfer impedance, and the largest electrochemical active area of  $1.71 \, \mathrm{mF \, cm^{-2}}$ .

The potential test for 100 h durability of V-doped Co-MOFs/Ni electrode is carried out at the current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. As shown in Figure 7, the activity of the catalyst almost does not deteriorate after a continuous 100 h OER, suggesting the synthesized V-doped Co-MOFs/Ni catalyst possessing good stability.

To study the effect of V ion leaching on the OER activity of the V-doped Co-MOFs/Ni catalyst, a series of ICP-AES tests are carried out (Figure 8a). With increasing the number of scanning cycles, the concentration of V ion increases gradually, while the leaching phenomenon of Co ion almost does not occur, as shown in **Table 1**. It is reasonably deduced that the  $V^{2+}$  is oxidized to high-valence VO2 or V2O5 during the electrochemical oxidation process. The formed high-valence vanadium oxides are easily dissolved in an alkaline electrolyte, resulting in the leaching of V ions. The leaching of V ions alters the composition and morphology of the V-doped Co-MOFs/Ni catalyst, which also produces a defect site and contributes to the surface reconstruction. It is in good agreement with the surface morphology

change, as shown in Figure 3. The potential and charge-transfer impedance of the V-doped Co-MOFs/Ni catalyst are significantly decreased after electrochemical activation (Figure 8b,c). It is also concluded that the disadvantage of poor electrical conductivity of MOFs materials, to a certain extent, could be conquered accompanied by V ion leaching and surface reconstruction. So, the catalytic performance of OER is improved. The effects of electrochemical activation for 6 h and soaking in 1 m KOH solution for 6 h on OER performance of V-doped Co-MOFs/Ni catalyst are comparatively investigated, as shown in Figure 8d. The results show that the former is superior to the latter in modifying the OER activity of the V-doped Co-MOFs/Ni catalyst. It indicates that the improved catalytic performance of V-doped Co-MOFs/Ni is due to the electrochemical reaction of the anode resulting in V ion leaching, rather than a conventional chemical reaction.

#### 3. Conclusion

A green facile synthesis method of preparing V-doped Co-MOFs/Ni nonprecious OER catalysts is demonstrated. The structure, surface morphology, and electrochemical performance of V-doped Co-MOFs/Ni electrodes are systematically investigated. The V ions have considerable effects on the morphology and OER performance. The Co-MOFs/Ni + 3 mM NaVO3 electrode possesses the best catalytic activity and excellent intrinsic activity with the lowest overpotential of 253 mV@10 mA cm $^{-2}$ , the smallest Tafel slope of 56 mV dec $^{-1}$ , the smallest charge transfer impedance, the largest electrochemical active area of 1.71 mF cm $^{-2}$ , and good stability. The electrochemical reaction of the anode results in V ion leaching and accounts for the morphology change and catalytic performance improvement of the V-doped Co-MOFs/Ni electrode.

## 4. Experimental Section

Materials and Structure/Morphology Measurements: All chemicals required for the synthesis of materials and physical measurements are commercially available and utilized without further purification. The crystal structures and phases of as-prepared Co-MOFs/Ni and V-doped Co-MOFs/Ni electrodes were physically characterized by a D/Max-2400 X-ray diffraction (XRD) instrument. JSM-6701F field emission scanning electron microscope (SEM) was used to investigate the morphology of Co-MOFs/Ni precursor and the effect of NaVO<sub>3</sub> solution concentration on the morphology of the catalyst.

Pretreatment of Ni Foam Substrate: In the process of manufacturing and transportation, the surface of commercial Ni foam often produces a nickel oxide layer due to oxidation or contamination with oil. Therefore, the Ni foam sheet of  $50 \times 10 \times 1.5$  mm was immersed in a mixed solution of ethanol/acetone, and ultrasonically treated for 30 min to remove the oil contamination. Then, the Ni foam was immersed in 3 M HCl, and ultrasonically treated for 30 min to remove the nickel oxide layer. After that, the treated Ni foam substrate was rinsed with deionized water until the pH value of the washing solution was neutral. Finally, the pretreated Ni foam was soaked in an ethanol solution for use.

Preparation of Co-MOFs/Ni Precursors: Two clean 100 mL beakers were marked as A and B. Then, 35 mL deionized water, 1.223 g Co(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>·6H<sub>2</sub>O, 0.3362 g sodium salicylate, and 0.6222 g NH<sub>4</sub>F were added into the beaker A and stirred magnetically for 30 min. 0.3489 g terephthalic acid was dissolved in the beaker B containing 35 mL deionized water. Afterward, 1.0 M KOH solution was slowly added under stirring conditions till the pH value approached neutral. After 30 min of magnetic stirring, the limpid terephthalic acid solution was obtained. The obtained terephthalic acid solution in beaker B was slowly poured into beaker A. After magnetic stirring for 30 min, the solution was poured into the 100 mL polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) reactor liner, a piece of pretreated Ni foam was put into the PTFE reactor liner, and then transferred to the stainless-steel autoclave for hydrothermal treatment at 140 °C for 6 h. The Ni foam was washed repeatedly with deionized water and dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C for 12 h to obtain the Co-MOFs/Ni precursor with a nickel-cobalt ratio of 1:4.

Preparation of V-Doped Co-MOF/Ni Electrodes: Three clean beakers numbered C, D, and E were taken, and 60 mL NaVO<sub>3</sub> solution with concentrations of 1, 3, and 5 mmol L<sup>-1</sup> were measured, respectively. Then, magnetically stirred at room temperature for 30 min, and transferred the solutions to three PTFE reactors. Subsequently, the Co-MOFs/Ni precursor with a nickel–cobalt ratio of 1:4 prepared in the previous step was added and transferred to the stainless-steel autoclave for hydrothermal treatment at 120 °C for 6 h. Three V-doped Co-MOFs/Ni intermediates with different vanadium contents were obtained. The V-doped Co-MOFs/Ni with deionized water was washed and dried at 60 °C for 12 h in a vacuum oven.

Electrochemical Measurements: The electrochemical performance of different electrode materials in 1 M KOH solution was tested by a three-electrode test system using Autolab Electrochemical Workstation (PGSTAT 302F, Beijing, China) under a constant temperature water bath at 30 °C. A prepared V-doped Co-MOFs/Ni electrode with different V and Co ratios was cut to  $10 \times 10$  mm as a working electrode. The  $20 \times 30$  mm graphite electrode and the CHI152 Hg/HgO electrode were used as the counter electrode and the reference electrode, respectively. Oxygen evolution activity test: cyclic voltammetry (CV) was used, the potential range was set at 1.2-1.8 V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)), and the scanning rate was 50 mV s<sup>-1</sup> for 30 cycles. After electrode stabilization, linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was performed at 1 mV  $\mbox{s}^{-1}$ scanning speed, and the range of potential was set to 1.8-1.0 V (vs RHE). CV was used for the double-layer capacitance test. The potential range was set to 1.0-1.1 V (vs RHE), the sweep speed was set to  $100-500 \, \text{mV s}^{-1}$ , and the growth rate was set to  $100 \, \text{mV s}^{-1}$ . The electrochemical impedance test was performed using the AC impedance method of measuring the solution resistance and charge transfer resistance within the frequency range of 10<sup>5</sup>-0.01 Hz. The durability of the prepared V-doped Co-MOFs/Ni electrode was tested under 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> current density in 1 M KOH solution by Chrono Potentiometry.

Inductively Coupled Plasma-Atomic Emission Spectrometry (ICP-AES) Test: An ICP-AES was used to study the V ion leaching of V-doped Co-MOFs/Ni catalyst which determines the OER activity of the catalyst. First, the ICP standard solution needed to be configured. 2.5 mL pure Co standard liquid and 2.5 mL pure V standard liquid into a volumetric bottle were added, the volume with deionized water to the scale line was filled, and the cobalt–vanadium standard liquid with a concentration of 50  $\mu g \ mL^{-1}$  was configured. Then 20  $\mu g \ mL^{-1}$  cobalt–vanadium standard solution was diluted. The above process was repeated to obtain

10, 1, and 0.1  $\mu$ g mL<sup>-1</sup> cobalt–vanadium standard solutions. Next, the ICP test samples (5 mL) were taken from the above standard solutions and labeled 0, 10, 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 cycles. The prepared V-doped Co-MOFs/Ni electrode is then subjected to continuous CV test on an electrochemical workstation. The blank sample was 1  $\mu$  KOH solution.

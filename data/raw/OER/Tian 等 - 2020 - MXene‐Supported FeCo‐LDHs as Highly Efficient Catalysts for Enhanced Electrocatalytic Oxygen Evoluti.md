# **MXene-supported FeCo-LDHs as high efficient catalyst for enhanced electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction**

Ming Tian,[a] Yi Jiang,\*[a] Haili Tong,[a] Yingming Xu,[a] and Lixin Xia\*[a]

Water oxidation is the rate-determining step for water splitting. The layered double hydroxides (LDHs) play an important role in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Combining with some twodimensional (2D) materials with high surface area and electrical conductivity can greatly improve the performance of water oxidation. Herein, we report a composite material that FeCo layered double hydroxides (FeCo-LDHs) were combined with single layer MXene (Ti3C2Tx). The single-layer MXene takes full advantage of the more active sites, reflecting higher electrochemical activity than other forms of MXene (nanofiber and multilayer). The resulting FeCo-LDH/MXene hybrid provides high electron transfer ability and electrochemically active surface area, leading to an enhancement of catalytic activity and durability for OER. An extremely low overpotential of 268 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm-2 was achieved, which was lower than Graphene or MWCNT combined with FeCo-LDH.

#### **1. Introduction**

The hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER) are regarded as the cornerstone of technologies for electrochemical water splitting, which play a crucial role in clean and renewable energy conversion. [\[1\]](#page-7-0) Since oxygen release is a four-electron process during the water splitting reaction, it's urgent to seek efficient catalysts to overcome the high overpotential and promote the kinetics. [2] Noble metal-based catalysts (IrO<sup>2</sup> and RuO2) for OER are remarkably effective, but their shortage and high cost limit their large-scale application.[\[3\]](#page-7-1) Non-noble metal oxide, sulfide, phosphide, and hydroxide (such as CoOx, NiSx, CoP, NiCo-LDH) have been extensively studied as OER catalysts.[4] Apart from these, the metal compounds supported by materials with large specific surface area and more binding sites have also achieved considerable catalytic activity (such as CoP/rGo, NiMn-LDH/MWCNT).

Multifarious layered materials have received extensive concern due to their distinctive 2D structure (Graphene, MXene, MoS2, ect.), which have been intensively explored in catalysis, sensing, and energy storage.[\[6\]](#page-7-3) After a period of boom research on graphene, 2D transition metal carbides and nitrides known as MXene have been unveiled one after another very recently.[\[7\]](#page-7-4) MXene represents by chemical formula is Mn+1XnTx(n=1, 2 and 3), in which M is regarded as early transition metal; X represents C or N; T is surface functional groups (-O, -F) endowing MXene with good hydrophilicity.[\[8\]](#page-7-5) One of the most widely used MXene, Ti3C2T<sup>x</sup> has acttracted significant attention owing to its unique electrical, optical and mechanical properties.[\[9\]](#page-7-6) Particularly, it has a higher capability to tailor desired chemical and structural features than other 2D materials, therefore has been considered as highly promising electrode materials for electrocatalytic water splitting.[\[10\]](#page-7-7)

The layered double hydroxides (LDHs) are regards as the most active OER catalysts among non-noble metal catalysts owing to their bulk redox activity and strong synergistic effect of multiple metal centers.[\[11\]](#page-7-8) However, it is difficult to achieve well dispersed LDH nanosheets, which might agglomerate easily because of the large surface energy resulting in a slow OER efficiency.[\[12\]](#page-7-9) Combining LDH with MXene can reduce the aggregation of LDH and promote the efficiency of electron transport in the catalytic process.[\[13\]](#page-7-10)

Inspired by the above analysis, we envision designing an interesting hybrid architecture, in which FeCo-LDHs are loaded on MXene(Ti3C2Tx) nanosheets to optimize the OER performance by taking advantage of synergistic effect in bimetals and fast charge transfer between LDHs and MXene, which not only guarantee fast electrical conductance, but also accelerate the redox process of FeCo-LDH during OER. The FeCo-LDH/MXene hybrid shows excellent catalytic activity and reaction kinetics with a low overpotential of 268 mV at the current density of 10 mA cmin 1.0 M KOH, which is obviously lower than that in other patterns (FeCo-LDH/Graphene, FeCo-LDH/MWCNT and FeCo-LDH alone).

## **2. Results and Discussion**

#### **2.1 Structure of Electrocatalysts**

The experimental flow chart of this work is shown in Scheme 1. MXenes (Ti3C2Tx) were prepared by removing the Al layers from the bulk MAX (Ti3AlC2) phase with LiF and HCl. FeCo-LDHs were formed on the surface of MXenes in the presence of urea under reflux conditions and then the obtained hybrid was involved in electrocatalytic OER process as a highly efficient anode material.

**Scheme 1** The preparation of FeCo-LDH/MXene and catalytic process flow chart

The scanning electron microscope (SEM) of the bulk MAX in Figure S1a displays a characteristic texture of thick layered structure. After etching by HCl and LiF, single layer MXene nanosheets were collected from the upper solution during the washing process, as the SEM image shown in Figure 1a. The comparison of two X-Ray diffraction (XRD) patterns in Figure S1b demonstrates the successful preparation of MXene: the sharp diffraction peaks from MAX are disappeared, while the peak at 6.77° broadens and has an apparent shift to lower angle compared to MAX (9.5°), indicating the formation of (002) facet of MXene.[\[9\]](#page-7-6) As shown in the Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images (Figure S2a and b), they are probably about 3 nm measured by NanoScope Analysis 1.9, which mignt be the thickness of the two nanosheets stacked together. It can be seen in the TEM that the thin MXene nanosheets are staggered distributed and its SAED shows that the nanosheets maintains good crystallinity and hexagonal symmetry. During the preparation of MXene, the induced group -OH and -F enhanced the electronegativity and hydrophilicity of MXene and provided rich active sites for the formation of FeCo-LDHs on it. Co(NO3)2·6H2O (0.3492 g), Fe(NO3)3·9H2O (0.1212 g), urea (1.0 g) and 10 mg MXene were distributed in deionized water and heated to 100 °C for 5 h under N<sup>2</sup> and then washed and freezed dried. Figure 1b is the SEM image of FeCo-LDHs without MXene, which shows a clear plate structure, but obvious aggregation of FeCo-LDHs can be seen due to the large surface energy of FeCo-LDHs. Figure 1c is the SEM image of FeCo-LDH/MXene (Fe:Co = 1:4), where FeCo-LDHs are uniformly loaded onto single layer MXene nanosheet. The energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) shows the percent atomic content of Fe, Co, Ti are 2.49 %, 9.82 % and 0.28 %, respectively (Figure e-f , S3), which are consistent with the amount of metal added. The XRD patterns shown in Figure 1d validate the successful preparation of MXene nanosheets, FeCo-LDH and FeCo-LDH/MXene (Fe:Co = 1:4). In the diffractogram of the FeCo-LDH/MXene, the characteristic peaks include (003), (006), (012), (015), (018), (110) and (013) facets. The disappearance of MXene (002) peak suggests the suppressed restacking of MXene nanosheets by FeCo-LDHs wraping around it. The diffraction peaks of FeCo-LDH are very weak, most likely due to the poor crystallization. Therefore, MXene may play an important role in the formation of FeCo-LDH crystal structure. As shown in high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image in Figure S4, the interplanar spacing of 0.196 nm is attributed to the (018) facet of FeCo-LDH. Given that the content of Fe and Co greatly affects the morphology and OER activity of FeCo-LDH/MXene hybrid. Bimetallic loading on MXene hybrids with different Fe:Co ratios were prepared by adjusting the amount of Co2+ under the condition that the amount of Fe2+ and MXene were constant. The SEM and TEM images of thesample hybrids are shown in Figure S4. When the ratio of Fe:Co is 1:1, the bimetal oxide nanoparticles are grown on the surface of the MXene rather than the LDH structure (Figure S5a-b). When the Fe:Co ratio turns to 1:2, shapeless nanosheets appear along with a certain accumulation (Figure S4c-d). In Figure S4e-f, the hybrid with the Fe:Co ratio of 1:4 exhibits a clear nanosheet structure with uniform shape. However, when the Fe:Co ratio reaches 1:6, the distribution of nanosheets become irregular and aggregated due to the excess cobalt salt (Figure S5g-h). The above SEM and TEM images show that the content of Fe and Co has a very significant effect on the morphology of FeCo bimetal.

As mentioned above, the MXenes used in this work were single layer nanosheets. To investigate the effect of the morphology and structure of MXene on the enhancement of OER activity, multilayer MXene nanosheets and MXene nanofibers were also prepared to combine with FeCo-LDH. Multilayer MXenes could be obtained from lower liguid by centrifuging in the preparing of MXene. Figure S6a shows the SEM image of multilayer MXene, in which obvious organ-like multilayer MXenes are visible. It is

shown that all the layers of MXene are wrapped by FeCo-LDH (Figure S6b). Besides, in the preparing process of FeCo-LDH/MXene, when much alkali was added, the structure of MXene was destroyed and the nanosheets turned into MXene nanofibers (Figure S6c).[14] Similarly, the FeCo-LDH was formed on the surface of the MXene nanofibers to give a FeCo-LDH/MXene nanofiber hybrid. (Figure S6d).

The wide-scan X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) survey shown in Figure 2a reveals the signals of Ti, Co, Fe, O and C elements. All the XPS peaks were calibrated by C 1s (284.6 eV) before comparison. In Ti 2p spectrum (Figure 2b), two conspicuous peaks of FeCo-LDH/MXene shift to higher binding energy compared to those from MXene sheets for 3.2 eV. This phenomenon also occurred in Co 2p and Fe 2p spectra shown in Figure S6, which shift to higer binding energy for 0.48 eV and 0.54 eV respectively (Figure S7). It is an obvious evidence that there were strong interaction and probable charge transfer between FeCo-LDHs and MXene. The Co 2p spectrum (Figure 2c) contains two predominant peaks accompanied by two satellite peaks associated with Co 2p3/2 (780.8 eV) and 2p1/2 (796.8 eV), which can be devided into four sublevels: peaks at 782.1 eV and 798.4 eV are ascribed to Co2+, while peaks at 780.6 eV and 796.7 eV are connected with Co3+. Figure 2d exhibits the Fe 2p

spectrum, which shows the Fe 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 peaks at 711.8 eV and 725.3 eV including a satellite peak, while the peaks at 714.3 eV and 725.8 eV could be all assigned to the Fe3+, the peaks at 711.4 eV and 722.9 eV were assigned to the Fe2+ . The above analyses are consistent with the previous reports, further confirming the successful preparation of FeCo-LDH/MXene nanohybrids.[15]

The nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherm of MXene, FeCo-LDH and FeCo-LDH/MXene are shown in Figure S8. FeCo-LDH/MXene has the type IV isotherm with a surface area of 148.06 m<sup>2</sup>g -1 , which is greater than that of MXene and FeCo-LDH. The tremendous surface area provides a higher contact area with the electrolyte and more active sites for OER process.

## **2.2 Electrochemica Evaluation For OER**

The electrocatalytic performance was evaluated on a CHI 760E electrochemical workstation with a standard three-electrode system in 1 M KOH. First, the samples without MXene (CoOOH, FeOOH and FeCo-LDH) were prepared to compare their OER activity. The linear sweep voltammetry curves (LSVs) in Figure S9 show that FeCo-LDH delivers an advantageous electrocatalytic activity. An overpotential of 0.413 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) at the current density of 10 mA cm-2 is observed,

lower than that of FeOOH (hardly any effect) and CoOOH (0.423 V), indicating the evident preponderance of the FeCo-LDH relative to FeOOH and CoOOH in electrocatalytic OER process. And the LSV curves of the various samples are shown in Figure S10, reflecting the distinction of the current density for OER generated by the electrodes with different Fe: Co ratios. The overpotentials of different samples at the current densities of 20 mA cm-2 , 50 mA cm-2 , 80 mA cm-2 are given in Figure 3a.The sample with the Fe:Co ratio of 1:4 exhibits a higher current density and a lower overpotential, indicating a well-dispersed layered structure is beneficial to high catalytic activity. Thus, 1:4 is used as the standard Fe:Co ratio for subsequent electrochemical tests.The LSV curves in Figure 3b show a comparison of the OER activity of FeCo-LDH, MXene, CoOOH/MXene, FeOOH/MXene and FeCo-LDH/MXene. MXene alone and FeOOH/MXene exhibit no OER currents within the measurement voltage range. However, the addition of MXene obviously improves the catalytic activity of FeCo-LDH. These indicate that the FeCo-LDH is the real active phase for catalyzing OER and MXene functions in reinforcing charge transfer and creating more active sites. Moreover, FeCo-LDH combined with MXene still keeps a significant advantage over CoOOH or FeOOH with MXene. FeCo-LDH/MXene delivers a relatively competitive overpotential of 0.268 V to reach a current density of 10 mA cm-2 , which is much lower than FeCo-LDH

**Figure 3.** Electrochemical performance tests of different catalysts. (a) Comparison of voltages to achieve different current densities with kinds of Fe:Co ratios; (b) LSV curves; (c) LSV curves; (d) Tafel curves; (e) LSV curves; (f) Summary of overpotentials at the current density of 10 mA cm-2

(0.413 V), CoOOH/MXene (0.331 V). As the voltage increases, the current density of FeCo-LDH/MXene increases more significantly. For instance, at the current density of 50 mA cm-2 , FeCo-LDH/MXene has an overpotential of 0.345 V, still well below CoOOH/MXene (0.545 V) and FeCo-LDH (0.504 V). The turnover frequencies (TOFs) and mass activity for OER are calculated in Figure S11, which is derived from FeCo-LDH/MXene

LSV curve on the assumption that all Co and Fe atoms in the materials are catalytically active. For example, at an overpotential of 0.4 V, a TOF of 0.106 s−1 and mass activity 256 mA mg−1 were obtained by FeCo-LDH/MXene. For comparison, graphene and

multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) supported hybrid samples were prepared by the same method, denoted as FeCo-LDH/Graphene and FeCo-LDH/MWCNT, respectively. Graphene electrocatalytic activity compared to the pristine FeCo-LDH, but inferior to FeCo-LDH/MXene (Figure 3c), suggesting the preponderance of MXene in enhancing the OER activity compared with other catalyst support materials. To compare the catalytic efficiency of the above catalysts, the tafel plots derived from the LSV curves are shown in Figure 3d. FeCo-LDH/MXene exhibits a lower slope (85 mV dec-1 ) than FeCo-LDH/MWCNT (97 mV dec-1 ), FeCo-LDH/Graphene (105 mV dec-1 ) and FeCo-LDH (108 mV dec-1 ), therefore confirming the change of the electronic structure and the more favorable reaction kinetics toward OER

and MWCNTs are well used as catalyst support materials in OER, owing to their good conductivity and specific interactions with catalysts. These two samples show appreciable enhanced generated by MXene. In addition, the OER activity of FeCo-LDH/MXene are influenced by the morphology of MXene, which were compared by LSV tests (Figure 3e). All the MXenesupported FeCo-LDH samples exhibit promoted OER activity compared to the pristine FeCo-LDH, further confirming the enchanced charge transfer and active surface by MXene materials. Howerer, the overpotentials of FeCo-LDH/MXene multilayer and FeCo-LDH/MXene nanofiber at the current density of 10 mA cm-2 are 0.329 V and 0.382 V, respectively, higher than that of FeCo-LDH/MXene, implying inferior activity toward OER.

**Figure 4.** (a) Nyquist plots of kinds of different catalysts at 1.55 V (vs. RHE). (b) The plots of currents against scan rates at 1.22 V (RHE). (c) Chronopotentiometric response of at the current density of 10 mA cm−2 . (d) LSV curves of FeCo-LDH/MXene before and after 30000 s.

The single layer MXene nanosheets engender more favourable combination with FeCo-LDH, getting better OER activity, indicating the significance of MXene in constructing an efficient OER catalyst. Figure 3f is the summary of the overpotentials of different catalysts at the current density of 10 mA cm-2 , in which FeCo-LDH/MXene shows the lowest overpotential among all the samples, again revealing the outstanding catalytic activity of FeCo-LDH/MXene toward OER.

The charge-transfer properties of the sample catalysts were measured by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) to further comfirm the different rates of charge transfer during OER of different catalysts. The Nyquist plots in Figure 4a were fitted by the RC circuit model in Fig S12. Evidently, when FeCo-LDH is combined with MXene, Graphene and MWCNT, the charge transfer resistance is reduced. FeCo-LDH/MXene exhibits the

smallest Rct at the potential of 1.55 V vs RHE (FeCo/MXene 14 Ω, FeCo-LDH/MWCNT 37 Ω, FeCo-LDH/Graphene 48 Ω FeCo-LDH 53 Ω), revealing an obviously reduced potential barrier and improved charge transferkinetic across the catalyst, which is consistent with LSV and Tafel results. The intrinsical reason of the promoted charge transfer might be the unique structure. The indroduction of MXene into FeCo-LDH could increase the surface area of catalysts and reduce the aggregation of FeCo-LDH. To further research the higher catalytic activity of FeCo-LDH/MXene, the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) of different materials were measured, which is proportional to the doublelayer capacitance (Cdl).[\[16\]](#page-8-0) The plot of the charging current (ic) as a function of multiple scan rates (v) gives a straight line with a slope equal to Cdl from Figure S13 and the Cdl of FeCo-LDH/MXene, FeCo-LDH and MXene were measured to be 1.97 mF and 0.408 mF and 0.0065 mF, respectively (Figure 4b). As a

result, the ECSA of FeCo-LDH/MXene, FeCo-LDH and MXene were calculated to be 49.25 cm-2 and 10.2 cm-2 and 0.1625 cm-2 , respectively. The significant enhanced ECSA after FeCo-LDH combined with MXene demonstrates that the introduction of MXene improves the dispersion of FeCo-LDH and creates more exposed active sites, leading to much better OER activity.

The stability and durability exploration of FeCo-LDH/MXene, FeCo-LDH/MWCNT, FeCo-LDH/Graphene and FeCo-LDH are shown in Figure 4c. With a constant current density of 10 mA cm−2 FeCo-LDH/MXene exhibits an extremely stable overpotential around 0.274 V-0.285 V within 30000 s, manifesting much higher stability than the other three FeCo-LDH-containing hybrids. The SEM image in Figure S14 shows that the morphology of FeCo-LDH/MXene remains very intact after 30000 s OER process. In Figure 4d, the LSV curves before and after 30000 s measurement have almost no change, indicating the decrease of electrocatalytic activity after long-term cycle is negligible. To verify that the current density originates from water oxidation, the faradaic efficiency of FeCo-LDH/MXene catalyst for OER was measured by the RRDE technique at the disk potential varied from 1.523 V to 1.553 V (Figure S15). The decrease of faradaic efficiency with increasing disk potential is due to the hardly reduction of plentiful O<sup>2</sup> on Pt ring electrode. The highest faradaic efficiency tested is 98 % at a disk potential of 1.523 V. These results demonstrate a broad perspective of FeCo-LDH/MXene as an OER catalyst with superior activity and good stability.

#### **3. Conclusions**

In conclusion, FeCo-LDH supported on MXene as high efficient electrocatalyst has been constructed for much enhanced OER performance. The introduction of MXene stabilized the LDH nanostructure against aggregation and led to a strong synergistic interaction between the FeCo-LDH and MXene, endowing the FeCo-LDH/MXene hybrid high electron transfer ability and abundant active sites. The FeCo-LDH/MXene hybrid showed a significant enhancement compared to FeCo-LDH in electrocatalytic activity and durability for OER. A robust water oxidation current was achieved with an extremely low overpotential of 268 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm-2 . The high OER catalytic performance also outperformed FeCo-LDH supported on graphene and MWCNT. These unique characteristics make it prominent as an excellent OER catalyst in the field of electrocatalytic water splitting.

#### **Experimental Section**

#### **Catalysts synthesis**

The detailed steps for preparing MXene with MAX are described in the supporting information. The composite catalysts were prepared by the following methods: Co(NO3)2·6H2O (0.3492 g), Fe(NO3)3·9H2O (0.1212 g) and urea (1.0 g) were dissolved in 2 mL deionized water (Fe:Co = 1:4). The thin MXene nanosheets or alternative materials (multilayer MXene, MWCNT or Graphene) were consistent to 10 mg and dispersed into 2 ml deionized water and 1 ml N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP). The two [dispersion](file:///D:/360Downloads/Youdao/Dict/8.5.3.0/resultui/html/index.html#/javascript:;) [liquids](file:///D:/360Downloads/Youdao/Dict/8.5.3.0/resultui/html/index.html#/javascript:;) were mixed keeping 100 °C for 5 h in N<sup>2</sup> atmosphere. FeCo-LDHs were synthesized without adding the supported materials by the same way. The obtained mixture was washed repeatedly with deionized water, centrifugally separated and [freeze](file:///D:/360Downloads/Youdao/Dict/8.5.3.0/resultui/html/index.html#/javascript:;) [drie](file:///D:/360Downloads/Youdao/Dict/8.5.3.0/resultui/html/index.html#/javascript:;)d. By adjusting the proportions of Fe:Co (nFe3+:nCo2+) ratios, different Fe:Co ratio samples can be obtained. FeCo-LDH/MXene nanofiber was obtained by a similar way except that more urea (1.2 g) was added.

#### **Characterization of materials**

,

The X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) was conducted with a Bruker Smart APEX II powder diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution ransmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images were obtained using a JEOL 2100 operated at 200 kV. Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) was carried out by a Quanta SU8010 scanning electron microscope instrument operated at 10 kV. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data was tested using a K-Alpha XPS spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherm was obtained using a QuantachromeAsiQ-C.

#### **Electrochemical measurements**

The performance of the electrocatalysts towards OER was evaluated on a CHI 760E electrochemical workstation (ChenHua Instruments, Shanghai, China) with a standard three electrode system in 1 M KOH. The catalysts (5 mg) were ultrasonically dispersed in mixture of ethanol (500 μL), deionized water (485 μL) and Nafion (15 μL, 5.0 wt%) to form a uniform suspension. A part of the catalyst ink (5 μL) was then loaded onto a glassy carbon (GC) electrode (d = 3 mm), yielding an average mass loading of around 0.357 mg cm−2 . All potentials measured against an Ag/AgCl electrode in this study, were converted to potential versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) according to the Nernst equation:

$$E_{RHE} = E_{Ag/Cl} + 0.059 \times pH + 0.197$$

The overpotential was calculated as follows:

$$\eta = E_{RHE} - 1.23$$

considering O2/H2O equilibrium at 1.23 V vs. RHE. Before the measurement, the electrolyte was bubbled with O<sup>2</sup> flow for 30 min. The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) were obtained with a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 . The tafel slope were obtained accroding to the tafel equation:

$$\eta = b \cdot log(j/j_0)$$

where η denotes the overpotential, b denotes the Tafel slope, j denotes the current density and j<sup>0</sup> denotes the exchange current density. AC impedance measurements were carried out in the same configuration at 1.55 V vs. RHE in a frequency range over

100 kHz to 1 Hz by applying an AC voltage with 5 mV amplitude. Chronopotentiometric measurements were recorded via applying a current density of 10 mA cm−2 on working electrode. The Faradaic efficiency for OER was measured by the RRDE (Rotating Ring-Disk Electrode) technique (Pine Research Instrumentation, USA)and calculated by the following equation:

$$\varepsilon = \frac{2i_r}{i_d N}$$

where i<sup>r</sup> is the measured ring current, i<sup>d</sup> is constant disk current and N = 0.39 is the collection efficiency for the RRDE, which is conducted by a standard method suggested by PINE: The N was calculated by the equation:

$$N = -\frac{i_{ring}}{i_{disk}}$$

where the iring and i disk refer to the ring and disk currents, respectively. The ring potential is at a constant value of 0.323 V (vs. RHE).The TOF value were calculated by the following equation:

$$TOF = \frac{J \times A}{4 \times F \times m}$$

where J (A cm−2 ) is the current density, A is the area of the electrode, F is the faraday constant (96,485 C mol−1 ), m is the mole number of Fe and Co atoms in the catalyst. The electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) was derived from the electrochemical double-layer capacitance (Cdl) by measuring the non-Faradaic capacitive current with scan-rate dependence of cyclic voltammograms (CVs) in Figure S16. To determine doublelayer capacitance via CV, a potential range in which no apparent Faradaic processes occur was applied for CV in 1 M KOH solution and the charging current ( i<sup>c</sup> ) was recorded at multiple scan rates (v). Briefly, the double layer capacitance (Cdl) was given in the equation:

$$i_c = vCdl$$

Therefore, a plot of as a function of gives a straight line with a slope equal to Cdl .The ECSA calculation of the catalysts was based on equation:

$$ESCA = \frac{Cdl}{C_s}$$

The specific capacitance (Cs) for a flat surface is generally found to be in the range of 20-60 μF·cm-2 . For surface area calculations in this work we assume a middle value of 40 μF·cm-2 .

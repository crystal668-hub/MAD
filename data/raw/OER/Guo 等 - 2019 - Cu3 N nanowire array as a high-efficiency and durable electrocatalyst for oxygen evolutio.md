Developing non-precious oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts with high performance and long-term stability has drawn considering research interest in recent years. In this communication, we reported a self-supported Cu<sub>3</sub>N nanowire array on copper foam (Cu<sub>3</sub>N NA/CF) which derived from Cu(OH)<sub>2</sub> nanowire array on copper foam (Cu(OH)<sub>2</sub> NA/CF) through nitridation process. Intriguingly, such 3D electrode exhibits marvelous OER activity with the need of an overpotential of only 298 mV at a current density of 20 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> in 1.0 M KOH. In addition, the obtained electrocatalyst is capable to maintain its high performance for at least 25 h under a static current density of 20 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>.

In the past few years, the depletion of fossil fuels has caused serious environment pollution and the energy shortage has been aroused wide concern.1,2 The grim situation forces human beings to search for clean energy as alternatives. Hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) is considered to be a promising candidate with a high energy density and CO<sub>2</sub>-free characters.3-6 Electrochemical water electrolysis produced H<sub>2</sub> has been regarded as a promising technology to address energy and environmental problems. Typically, the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) involves the complex transportation of four protons/electrons and high activation energy for the formation of O=O double bond, which renders intrinsically sluggish kinetics.7-10 Up to date, noble metal oxides, RuO2 and IrO2, are the most efficient catalysts, but their high cost, poor durability restraint application. 11,12 Accordingly, it is urgently necessary to develop earth-abundant and cost-effective OER catalysts for water oxidation electrocatalysis.

Recently, significant efforts have been devoted to design and develop cheap non-noble catalysts for water splitting, and substantial progresses have been achieved. Intriguingly, the

transition-metal-based catalysts such as oxyhydroxides, 13,14 dichalcogenides, 15,16 selenides, 17,18 oxides 19,20 and nitrides 21,22 have been reported as promising candidates to noble metals for OER. Among them, transition metal nitrides show excellent catalytic activity in various fields as a result of their unique electronic structure that enables appropriate adsorption between the surface of nitrides and the OH- during the catalytic processes. 23-26 Because of the intrinsic nonideal electron transportation, many transition transition-metalbased catalysts suffer from low electrical conductivity and sluggish kinetics. In the past few years, mixing electrocatalysts with conductive materials such as electric polymer,<sup>27</sup> carbon,<sup>28</sup> graphene,<sup>29</sup> metal<sup>30</sup> and so on is a general method to improve electrocatalytic performance. But such approach gives rise to disordered microstructure and low surface areas which are adverse to water splitting. In comparison with other transition metals, Cu-based catalyst are much more conductive, earthabundant, and easier to synthesize but they are rarely used for OER. On the other hand, the in-situ grown nanoarray catalyst on a conductive substrate is able to increases the electrode stability, lowers the series resistance, exposes more active sites, and facilitates the diffusion of electrolyte and gas. 31-33

Herein, we reported Cu<sub>3</sub>N nanowire array on copper foam (Cu<sub>3</sub>N NA/CF) which derived from Cu(OH)<sub>2</sub> nanowire array on copper foam (Cu(OH)2 NA/CF) through nitridation process. Such three dimension (3D) electrode exhibits marvelous OER activity with the need of an overpotential of only 298 mV at a current density of 20 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> in 1.0 M KOH. In addition, the obtained electrocatalyst is capable to maintain its high performance for at least 25 h under a static current density of 20 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. The marvelous activity and stability of Cu<sub>3</sub>N NA/CF could give the credit to the following: i) the direct grown Cu<sub>3</sub>N nanowires on copper foam allows good mechanical adhesion and electrical connection between them; ii) the good intrinsic electrical conductivity of Cu<sub>3</sub>N benefits fast electron transport along the nanowire; iii) the nanowire array format not only favors fast vectorial electron transport but increases catalyst loading, thus leading to improved catalytic efficiency; iv) the nanoscale dimension and high

aspect ratio of  $\text{Cu}_3\text{N}$  nanowires maximize the number of exposed active sites and improve catalytic activity per geometric area; v) its 3D architecture enables easy diffusion of the electrolyte and thus more efficient utilization of active sites in  $\text{Cu}_3\text{N}$ .

Fig. 1a show the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of Cu<sub>3</sub>N NA/CF (red curve) and Cu(OH)<sub>2</sub> NA/CF (black curve). The strong diffraction peaks located at 43.5°, 50.6°, 74.3° stem from the Cu substrate.34 The pattern of Cu(OH)2 NA/CF displays peaks at 23.84°, 35.89°, 38.03°, 39.80°, 53.21°, and 64.73° indexed to the (021), (111), (041), (130), (150) and (152) planes of hexagonal Cu(OH)<sub>2</sub> (JCPDS No. 13-0420), respectively. And the Cu<sub>3</sub>N NA/CF displays signals at 23.26°, 33.18°, 40.89°, 47.59°, 53.61° and 74.56° indexed to the (100), (110), (111), (200), (210) and (300) planes of Cu<sub>3</sub>N (JCPDS No. 47-1088), respectively. In order to rule out the effect of substrate, the XRD measurement of copper foam after nitridation was conducted. In Fig. S1, the XRD pattern of nitrided copper foam was not markedly different from copper foam, indicating the substrate was hard to be nitrided and the real catalyst was Cu<sub>3</sub>N. The scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of Cu(OH)<sub>2</sub> NA/CF shows the CF are evenly covered by Cu(OH)<sub>2</sub> nanowires (Fig. 1b and 1c). It is found that the Cu<sub>3</sub>N maintained its nanowire array architecture and the surface became rough after nitridation process (Fig. 1d and 1f). At the same time, the energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) elemental mapping analysis was also conducted. As shown in Fig. S1, the Cu and N elements are uniformly distributed over the catalysts. In Fig. 1f, the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image also provide the evidence of nanowire morphology of Cu<sub>3</sub>N. Furthermore, the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image displays the well-resolved lattice fringes with an interplanar distance of 0.38 nm indexed to the (100) plane of Cu<sub>3</sub>N (Fig. 1g). Meanwhile, the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was carried out to identify the element valence state and examine chemical

composition of catalyst. As is shown in Fig. 1h, the two strong peaks located at 932.8 eV and 953.0 eV are 1953 great of Ca  $2p_{3/2}$  and Cu  $2p_{1/2}$ , respectively, which indicates the valence of Cu is  $+1.^{21,36}$  In N 1s region, the binding energy at 397.6 eV originate from the Cu–N bonds.  $^{37,38}$ 

The OER performance of Cu<sub>3</sub>N NA/CF (loading: ca. 2.0 mg cm<sup>-2</sup>) was investigated in 1.0 M KOH using a typical threeelectrode system with a scan rate of 5 mV s<sup>-1</sup>. For compromise, the OER activity of Cu(OH)2 NA/CF, RuO2 deposited on copper foam (RuO<sub>2</sub>/CF, loading: ca. 2.0 mg cm<sup>-2</sup>) and bare CF were measured under the same conditions. Besides, we applied an iR correction to all original data to reveal the intrinsic activity of catalyst and overpotentials were recorded on a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale.39,40 In Fig. 2a, the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curve of bare CF shows no catalytic performance. As observed, the RuO2/CF possessed marvelous OER property with the need of a low overpotential of 227 mV to drive current density of 20 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. The Cu(OH)<sub>2</sub> NA/CF displays poor electrocatalytic performance reaching an overpotential of 382 mV at 20 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. Impressively, the precursor shows a wonderful property after being nitrided. The as-obtained Cu<sub>3</sub>N NA/CF possess the low overpotential of 298 mV at current density of 20 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> which is better than most non-noble-metal catalysts documented in literature under alkaline condition (Table S1). Furthermore, the activity of Cu<sub>3</sub>N powder (n=363 mV at 20 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>) scratched down from copper foam is inferior to Cu<sub>3</sub>N performance (Fig. S3). The catalytic kinetics toward OER was examined by Tafel plots (Fig. 2b). The Tafel plot of RuO<sub>2</sub>/CF is about 87 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>, indicating the precious-metal-based catalysts have fast kinetics for OER. The value of Cu<sub>3</sub>N NA/CF (169 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>) is smaller than that of Cu(OH)<sub>2</sub> NA/CF, which manifests the former has a conducive reaction rate toward O2 evolution.

Fig. 2c displays the multi-current process of  $\text{Cu}_3\text{N NA/CF}$  in the current densities ranging from 40 to 240 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> with an increment of 20 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> per 500 s. At the start of 40 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, the potential immediately levels off at 0.75 V versus RHE and remains constant for the surplus 500 s. The remaining steps

have the identical result to the first one, suggesting superior mass transport properties, conductivity, and mechanical robustness of Cu<sub>3</sub>N NA/CF.<sup>41,42</sup> In the meantime, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis for Cu(OH)<sub>2</sub> NA/CF and Cu<sub>3</sub>N NA/CF was conducted as well (Fig. 2d). As observed, Cu<sub>3</sub>N NA/CF has a smaller semicircular diameter than that of Cu(OH)<sub>2</sub> NA/CF, suggesting Cu<sub>3</sub>N NA/CF possesses a smaller charge transfer resistance and is better for OER.

Fig. 3. (a) LSV curves of  $Cu_3N$  NA/CF before and after 500 cyclic voltammetry cycles. (b) Time-dependent current density curve of  $Cu_3N$  NA/CF.

A series of electrochemical measurements were carried out to characterize the durability of material. As shown in Fig. 3a, LSV curve of Cu<sub>3</sub>N NA/CF displays no distinct change compared the initial one after continuous cyclic voltammograms (CVs) scanning for 500 cycles in 1.0 M KOH at a scan rate of 100 mV s<sup>-1</sup>. Furthermore, such Cu<sub>3</sub>N NA/CF electrode could maintain its high catalytic activity at least 25 h under a static current density of 20 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, which confirms the superb durability of the catalyst. In addition, The XRD pattern of post-OER catalyst appeared two strong peaks located at 35.5° and 38.5°, which indicated the material was partly oxidized to CuO after longterm OER test (Fig. S5). In Fig. S6, the peak posited at 934.9 eV and two shake-up peaks were assigned to Cu2+.43,44 In Fig. S7, the SEM images and TEM image showed the catalyst still remained the nanowire array architecture after OER evaluations.

The high catalytic performance of Cu<sub>3</sub>N NA/CF may attribute to the rough surface of material which can expose more active sites. The electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) is employed as an appropriate method to reflect the surface roughness. Herein, we measured the double layer capacitance (C<sub>dl</sub>) of Cu<sub>3</sub>N NA/CF and Cu(OH)<sub>2</sub> NA/CF to evaluate their ECSAs. As shown in Fig. S2, the capacitance of Cu<sub>3</sub>N NA/CF (131.1 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>) is much larger than that of Cu(OH)<sub>2</sub> NA/CF (78.8 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>), indicating such Cu<sub>3</sub>N NA/CF possesses much higher ECSA and more rough surface. Furthermore, the open spaces between nanowires accelerate inward diffusion of electrolyte and outward diffusion of oxygen.

In summary, the self-supported  $Cu_3N$  nanowire array on copper foam ( $Cu_3N$  NA/CF) which derived from  $Cu(OH)_2$  nanowire array on copper foam ( $Cu(OH)_2$  NA/CF) through nitridation process. Serving as a 3D electrode, the as-obtained  $Cu_3N$  NA/CF exhibits marvelous OER activity with the need for an overpotential of only 298 mV at a current density of 20 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> in 1.0 M KOH. Moreover, it also possesses a long-term stability, which is capable to maintain high performance for at least 25 h under a static current density of 20 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. Such

work not only provides a high-performance and Alow const electrode for oxygen generation, but also offers promising features for potential utilization in technological devices.

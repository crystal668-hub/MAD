A series of bimetallic metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) were prepared on three-dimensional nickel foam (NF) using a onepot synthesis, marked as NiFe-MOF/NF. The structure of the asprepared NiFe-MOF/NF was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), FT-IR and Raman. Compared with the monometallic Ni-MOF material, the incorporation of Fe greatly changes the inherent properties of Ni-MOF. Electrochemical measurement results show the optimized NiFe-MOF/NF [Ni : Fe=3:7 (molar ratio)] has better electrocatalytic performance and the current densities of 50 mAcm <sup>2</sup> and 100 mAcm <sup>2</sup> have low overpotentials of 225 mV and 251 mV, respectively, for the oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline solution. In particular, the inverse curve of linear sweep voltammetry shows an ultralow overpotential of only 160 mV at current density of 10 mAcm <sup>2</sup> . NiFe-MOF/NF also has excellent stability and can run continuously for at least 50 h. NiFe-MOF/NF has remarkable OER performance, which is mainly due to the high conductivity, the large specific surface area and the synergistic effects of Fe and Ni in MOFs. The work presents a general strategy for the synthesis of electrocatalytic materials for effective and scalable electrocatalytic water oxidation.

## **Introduction**

Environmental pollution and energy shortage are more serious than ever. Therefore, it is very important to develop sustainable and clean energy to meet future energy needs.[1] Hydrogen energy without pollution in the combustion process is particularly important in the clean energy mix of the 21st century.[2] In recent years, electrochemical water splitting is one of the most attractive ways to produce efficient and clean hydrogen energy.[3] However, during water electrolysis, the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) involves a complex electron transfer process, which has slow kinetics and it is the rate-limiting step.[4] Therefore, an effective catalyst is required to improve OER reaction rate. Although the traditional catalysts containing Ir and Ru are considered to be the best OER catalysts, their expensive cost, poor stability and scarcity hinder their large-scale application in catalysis.[5] Therefore, there is an urgent need to find a cheap and effective OER electrocatalyst.

In general, transition metal oxides,[6] sulfides[7] and phosphides[8] are effective OER catalytic materials. However, it is necessary to construct catalytic materials with excellent performance. Here, as a special nanoporous material, metalorganic frameworks (MOFs), which have tunable ordered pores, large surface area and adjustable composition, have been regarded as ideal catalysts[9,10] However, the low conductivity and the poor stability greatly limit the application of MOFs in electrochemical catalysis.[11] Therefore, many strategies have been developed to improve the application of MOFs in electrocatalysis. For example, MOFs have been used as the sacrificial product to prepare high-performance catalysts under high-temperature calcination, such as oxides, carbides and sulfides.[12–15] However, the ordered pore structure of MOFs may be destroyed and the internal metal catalytic sites may be reduced during the high-temperature calcination process, leading to low catalytic activity and reduced long-term stability.[16] Therefore, it is not the best way to apply MOFs for electrolysis of water. However, bimetallic MOFs have been shown to have excellent OER catalytic performance.[17] The introduction of different metals can greatly enhance overall performance in MOFs. In particular, Fe/Ni-based MOFs materials exhibit excellent catalytic performance in OER. For example, NiFe-MOFs were prepared by Zhao et al., which have excellent conductivity and low OER overpotential is 240 mV at 10 mAcm <sup>2</sup> , 56 mV lower than single-metal Ni-MOFs.[18] Our previous work also indicates that FeNi-MOFs have excellent performance.[19,20] These studies clearly show that NiFe bimet-

effective mass transport and can reduce catalytic performance. The in situ preparation of the catalyst can avoid insufficient contact and provide a strong and tight contact between the catalyst and the substrate, which can increase the charge transfer rate and improve the stability of the catalyst.[23] Thus, in situ synthesis of MOFs is a promising strategy for developing efficient and durable catalysts. We found that MOFs with dual ligands have been widely used in adsorption separation and are rarely used in OER electrocatalysis research.[24] The Ni- (HBTC)(4,4'-bipy)⋅ 3DMF (H3BTC=1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid, bipy=bipyridine, DMF=*N*,*N*-dimethylformamide) has large specific surface area and special pore structure with two kinds of channels (5–8 Å and 6–7 Å as the channel sizes),[25] so it can provide a larger active area and more active sites, which gives it potential for application in electrolysis of water. Due to these structural advantages, it can be used as an efficient OER catalyst after structural optimization.

Herein, based on the above considerations, we prepared a series of bimetallic MOFs [NiFe(HBTC)(4,4'-bipy)⋅3DMF] (named NiFe-MOF/NF) on NF using a one-pot method. The electrochemical tests show that the optimized NiFe-MOF/NF exhibits excellent OER catalytic activity, which can be due to the high conductivity, the large specific surface area, and the synergistic effects of Fe and Ni in NiFe-MOF/NF. For stability testing, NiFe-MOF/NF exhibits good durability at current density of 100 mAcm <sup>2</sup> , making it have the potential of practical application. The catalyst preparation strategy and design ideas in this work are hoped to be applied to other bimetallic and even multimetal MOFs systems for a wide range of electrochemical applications.

## **Results and discussion**

#### **Morphology and structure of NiFe-MOF/NF**

The bimetallic NiFe-MOF was prepared using a one-pot method and the preparation process is shown in Scheme 1. After the solvothermal reaction, a uniform NiFe-MOF layer with high flexibility is formed on the NF surface (Figure S1 and Figure S2). The crystal structures of these samples were characterized by XRD in the Figure 1a. We obtained the CIF file of Ni-MOF through (CCDC: 636900), and then imported the CIF of Ni-MOF into the software mercury to obtain the NiFe-MOF XRD simulation. The XRD of NiFe-MOF/NF showed significant characteristic peaks at 2θ values of 7.8°, 10.7°, 15.7°, 18.4° and 23.6°. And there was a sharp diffraction peak at 44.5° caused by NF (JCPDS: 04-0850). More importantly, the XRD of NiFe-MOF/NF and NiFe-MOF powder agree well with the simulated Ni-MOF found in the literature,[26] showing the successful formation of NiFe-MOF on NF. Furthermore, we tested the XRD of the monometallic Ni-MOF/NF, Ni-MOF powder and other MOFs with different Ni and Fe (Figure S3 and Figure S4), their peak positions have a consistent fit with the simulated peaks, indicating that these MOFs were successfully prepared on NF and these MOFs maintained their structure when the mole fraction of the two metals changed from 0 to 1. However, the peak intensity is reduced, which is due to the reduced crystallinity of the prepared MOFs.

The morphology of the obtained materials was confirmed using SEM and TEM. Single metal Ni-MOF is grown in situ on the skeleton surface of NF (Figure S5), showing hexagonal morphology, which corresponds with previous reports.[27] Figure 1b reveals that NiFe-MOF with multilateral columnar structure has completely grown onto the NF and has a different morphology from Ni-MOF, which shows that adding Fe will affect the morphology of MOFs. The TEM image of NiFe-MOF, shows columnar structure, this finding is consistent with the SEM result (Figure 1c). No obvious lattice fringes are observed in the HRTEM image (Figure 1d), which may be caused by the damage of the beam under high pressure.[28,29] The EDS images indicate that the elements are uniformly distributed in NiFe-MOF/NF (Figure 1e). EDS profiles were acquired to confirm the elemental composition of NiFe-MOF/NF (Figure S6) and obtain the ratio of metal elements Ni and Fe (3.49:1). This result is similar to that of an ICP-AES analysis (4.31 :1) (Table S1).

FT-IR spectroscopy was performed to characterize functional groups in these catalysts (Figure 2a). This shows that they have similar structural integrity and chemical composition and they are consistent with Ni-MOF reported in the literature.[30] The C H peak occurs at approximately 3100 cm <sup>1</sup> and the peaks of C C stretches appear at approximately 1650 cm <sup>1</sup> and 1450 cm <sup>1</sup> in the aromatic ring skeleton.[31] The stretching vibration peak of C O is about 1380 cm <sup>1</sup> . The peaks at about 500 cm <sup>1</sup> and about 400 cm <sup>1</sup> prove the existence of

M–N and M–O bonds, indicating the metal M (Ni, Fe) is successfully combined with 4,4'-bipy and HBTC. The peak of O–H vibration appears at 3420 cm<sup>-1</sup>, indicating the presence of abundant hydrophilic groups in the catalyst. Thus, some hydrophilic groups are formed on the surface of the catalyst, which can efficiently adsorb the electrolyte on the OER reaction interface and improve its performance.<sup>[32]</sup> Raman spectroscopy further characterized these samples (Figure 2b). The C–H bending regions in aromatic rings have been verified at 864 cm<sup>-1</sup> and 810 cm<sup>-1</sup>, and –COO<sup>-</sup> is located at 660 cm<sup>-1</sup>. HBTC has very complicated vibration modes, including in-plane (1004 cm<sup>-1</sup>) and opposite out-of-plane (864 cm<sup>-1</sup>) vibration

modes. The more prominent peaks at 1620 cm<sup>-1</sup>, 1470 cm<sup>-1</sup>, 1295 cm<sup>-1</sup> and 1028 cm<sup>-1</sup> are caused by 4,4'-bipy.<sup>[33]</sup> More importantly, they have similar spectra and these results can prove the successful preparation of NiFe-MOF on NF.

The compositions and valence states of these samples were studied using XPS. The XPS survey results showed Ni-MOF/NF and NiFe-MOF/NF have Ni, C, O, N and Ni, Fe, C, O, N, respectively (Figure 3a). For NiFe-MOF/NF, in the Fe 2p XPS spectrum, the peaks positions of Fe  $2p_{1/2}$  and Fe  $2p_{3/2}$  are 723.0 eV and 710.3 eV, respectively (Figure 3b). The satellite peak appears at 715.0 eV, which shows the valence state of Fe is +3.<sup>[34]</sup> The peak positions of the Ni  $2p_{1/2}$  and Ni  $2p_{3/2}$  are

873.1 eV and 855.5 eV, respectively (Figure 3c). Besides, the two satellite peaks of Ni 2p are observed at 879.5 eV and 861.3 eV.

This result indicates the presence of +2 Ni.[35] For Ni-MOF/NF, the two peak positions of Ni 2p1/2 and Ni 2p3/2 are 873.4 eV and

855.7 eV in Ni 2p region. Therefore, the Ni 2p in NiFe-MOF/NF has lower binding energies, indicating that the electron density of Ni is increased. Ni sites with high electron density structures will enhance the OER catalytic activity, which is attributed to the transition metal OER activity depends on the interaction between the 3d orbital and the OOH species.[36] This phenomenon indicates that the local electronic environment of Ni has changed and there is a synergistic effect between Fe and Ni, which is beneficial to enhance the activity of OER. In Ni-MOF/ NF and NiFe-MOF/NF, the C 1s spectra (Figure 3d) is fitted to three peaks at 288.0 eV, 285.6 eV and 284.7 eV, which are attributed to carboxyl group (O C=O) in aromatic rings, C=N from 4,4'-bipy and C=C, respectively.[37] The peaks of the O 1s spectra (Figure 3e) are 532.6 eV, 531.4 eV and 530.7 eV, corresponding to the absorption water, carboxyl group (O C=O) and M (Ni or Fe) O, respectively.[38] For the N 1s spectra (Figure 3f), the peak of 399.5 eV corresponds to pyrrolic-N or M N. The spectra of C 1s, O 1s and N 1s have the same peak position in these samples, which indicates that they have the same chemical state. These results correspond to the FT-IR results. All these observations indicate that NiFe-MOF is successfully synthesized on NF.

To check the thermal stability of the catalyst, TGA was performed to analyze weightlessness. As can be seen from Figure S7, there is almost no weight loss for the two MOFs below 100°C due to not reaching the boiling point of the solvent molecule. At temperatures up to 250°C, 25% of the weight loss observed for NiFe-MOF and 35% of the weight loss observed for Ni-MOF is due to the removal of solvent DMF. Then, they barely lose weight when the temperature reaches 340°C. Next, the structure begins to break above this temperature. It is worth mentioning that the weight loss rate of NiFe-MOF is slower than Ni-MOF indicating that the addition of Fe can improve the thermal stability of MOF within a certain temperature range.

#### **Electrochemical performance**

The OER catalytic activity of NiFe-MOF/NF was investigated in 1.0 M KOH solution. For comparison, the electrocatalytic activities of Ni-MOF/NF and the blank NF were also measured for OER. The LSV curves with *iR* compensation show that NiFe-MOF/NF has higher activity than other catalysts (Figure 4a). The overpotentials of NiFe-MOF/NF (225 mV and 251 mV) are lower than the single metal Ni-MOF/NF (317 mV and 347 mV), RuO2/ NF (331 mV and 377 mV) and the blank NF (488 mV and 548 mV) at current densities of 50 mAcm <sup>2</sup> and 100 mAcm <sup>2</sup> (Figure 4b). However, there is a large oxidation peak during the rise of the LSV curve for NiFe-MOF/NF.[14] Therefore, according to the reverse LSV curve, there is an ultralow overpotential of 160 mV at current density of 10 mAcm <sup>2</sup> (Figure S8). The metal composition of MOFs was changed by adjusting the amount of Ni and Fe for obtaining the best electrochemical performance in OER. We further explored the effect of reaction time and temperature on NiFe-MOF/NF catalytic performance (Figure S9). The LSV curves show that NiFe-MOF/NF exhibits the best

**Figure 4.** (a) LSV curves for NiFe-MOF/NF [Ni : Fe=3:7 (molar ratio)], Ni-MOF/NF, RuO2/NF and blank NF in 1.0 M KOH; (b) Corresponding overpotentials; (c) Tafel plots and (d) EIS plots at 1.52 V (vs RHE).

catalytic performance when NiFe-MOF/NF with Ni: Fe=3:7 ( molar ratio) (Figure S9a), reaction time is 36 h (Figure S9b) and reaction temperature is 130°C (Figure S9c). The above results reveal that molar ratio of Ni/Fe, reaction time and solvothermal temperature have a significant effect on OER activity. Here, we also examine the effect of the iron precursor on NiFe-MOF/NF product, both FeCl3 ⋅6H2O and FeSO4 ⋅7H2O were used in the synthesis. However, there is no significant change in OER catalytic performance among different iron precursors, suggesting that anions have little impact on their catalytic performance (Figure S9d). In addition, it can be clearly seen from Table S2 that NiFe-MOF/NF [Ni : Fe=3:7 (molar ratio)] has the most excellent OER performance. It is worth noting that the performance of NiFe-MOF/NF is better than other reported OER catalysts (Table S3). Therefore, it has been proved that coexistence Ni and Fe into MOFs is beneficial to the catalytic performance.

To understand the OER catalytic kinetics, the Tafel plots were used to study the reaction kinetics of these samples toward OER. Figure 4c shows that NiFe-MOF/NF has a lower Tafel slope, indicating that it has more efficient kinetics. The EIS data to study the catalytic kinetics of these samples further were obtained at 1.52 V (vs RHE) in 1.0 M KOH. As shown in the Nyquist diagram (Figure 4d), among these catalysts, NiFe-MOF/ NF has the smallest semicircle diameter, which indicates excellent dynamics and improved conductivity. The above results indicate that the prepared bimetallic NiFe-MOF/NF can enhance the electron transport property and improve the reaction kinetics, which is beneficial to improve the electrocatalytic performance of OER. Therefore, the synergistic effect of Ni and Fe in MOFs was confirmed again.

Here, we propose the mechanism for NiFe-MOF/NF catalysed OER activity:

$$^{*\bullet} + OH^- \leftrightarrow ^* - OH + e^- \tag{1}$$

\*
$$-OH + 2OH^- \leftrightarrow *-OOH + H_2O + 2e^-$$
 (2)

\*
$$-OOH + OH^- \rightarrow *^{\bullet} + O_2 + H_2O + e^-$$
 (3)

Overall: 
$$4 \text{ OH}^- \leftrightarrow \text{O}_2 + 2\text{H}_2\text{O} + 4\text{e}^-$$
 (4)

Here, \* means active sites (Ni(Fe)OOH in MOFs). Step (1) and (2) are reversible, while step (3) is irreversible and becomes a speed determination step. The catalyst is mainly used to facilitate kinetics of step (3). Compared with Ni-MOF/NF, NiFe-MOF/NF has a smaller Tafel slope and lower EIS value, showing it has excellent kinetics. In the case of anode OER, the metal in MOFs is oxidized to Ni(Fe)OOH species, which can promote the conversion of OH to O2, which greatly promotes the reaction of step (3).

To clarify further the reasons for this superior performance, the number of active sites exposed on these samples was compared; the double-layer capacitance (Cdl) was obtained by CV test to evaluate electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) in the non-Faradaic region (Figure 5a and Figure 5b). Figure 5c and Figure 5d reveal that the Cdl value of NiFe-MOF/NF (7.12 mF cm <sup>2</sup> ) is higher than Ni-MOF/NF (5.21 mF cm <sup>2</sup> ), indicating NiFe-MOF/NF has a larger ECSA, so it provides more active sites for OER catalysis. The N2 adsorption and desorption isotherms and pore diameter distribution of NiFe-MOF were measured to the large specific surface area and its inherent porous structure. The adsorption curve increase significantly at lower relative pressures, showing the main micropore characteristics (Figure S10a). There is a clear hysteresis between adsorption and desorption at higher relative pressures, indicating there are some mesopores in NiFe-MOF. The measurement results show that the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) of NiFe-MOF is 663 m<sup>2</sup> /g and its micropore diameter is mainly 1.6 nm with a small amount of 14–20 nm mesopores (Figure S10b). As shown in Figure S11, although the incorporation of Fe reduces the adsorption of MOFs, NiFe-MOF still has a high specific surface area. The high specific surface area facilitates contact between the catalyst and electrolyte, and the porous structure can provide a faster path for charge transfer, which can lead to excellent OER performance.

Stability tests are conducted to evaluate the practical application of electrocatalysts. Here, we use the chronopotentiometric curves to evaluate the stability at 50 mAcm <sup>2</sup> and 100 mAcm <sup>2</sup> . The measurement results show that the stability time is at least 50 h without significant change, indicating that NiFe-MOF/NF has long stability and strong corrosion resistance in 1.0 M KOH solution (Figure 5e). Figure 5f shows that NiFe-MOF/NF can still work effectively after performing 1000 CV cycles with slight changes. However, the overpotential of Ni-MOF/NF is continuously increasing at 100 mAcm <sup>2</sup> (Figure 5e inset) and the LSV curve changes more obviously after 1000 CVs, showing the stability of Ni-MOF/NF is relatively poor, which proves that the incorporation of Fe can improve the structural stability of MOFs. In order to make the catalyst closer to practical applications, we continue to test the stability of NiFe-MOF/NF. Figure S12 shows that the curve does not change significantly at a current density of 100 mAcm <sup>2</sup> and after 2000 CVs, which further verifies that the catalyst has a very excellent stability. The OER catalytic stability of NiFe-MOF/ NF can be attributed to the coexistence of Fe and Ni and the good combination with MOFs and NF. After the stability test, NiFe-MOF/NF was analyzed by XRD, XPS, SEM and TEM. First, we performed XRD analysis of NiFe-MOF/NF after the OER test (Figure S13) and it can be clearly seen that some new peak positions have appeared, which can be attributed to the formation of hydroxide (NiOOH and FeOOH JCPDS:18-0639). However, the characteristic peaks of NiFe-MOF/NF are still retained, which also indicate that NiFe-MOF/NF can still maintain its structure after long-term durability testing. Next, the XPS spectrums were obtained of NiFe-MOF/NF (Figure S14). And the XPS results show that Fe 2p, Ni 2p and C 1s spectra have no significant differences before and after the OER test, while the intensity of N 1s is different from that of the primary spectrum and the OH is present in the O 1s, which indicates that the catalyst content is decrease and some hydroxide has been formed. The SEM image shows that NiFe-MOF still has columnar structure on NF and the distribution is reduced, confirming the XPS conclusion (Figure S15a). TEM further

verified the SEM results, and some sheets were formed on the columnar structure (Figure S15b). These indicate that the prepared catalyst has high stability, and the hydroxide formed in OER plays a key role in the catalytic process. However, the SEM of Ni-MOF/NF after the stability test shows that its morphology has changed greatly, indicating that its stability is extremely low (Figure S16). The oxygen products from the OER using the NiFe-MOF/NF electrode were quantified by gas chromatography at a fixed current of 50 mA (Figure S17). The results show that the O2 generated was 7.13 μmol cm 2min <sup>1</sup> and the Faradaic efficiency reaches 91.88% in 1.0 M KOH solution.

In a word, the remarkable electrocatalytic performance of NiFe-MOF/NF is due to these aspects: (1) Fe is beneficial to improve the stability and conductivity of MOFs, thereby improving the catalytic performance; (2) The preparation of the MOFs on NF skeleton can provide a strong and tight contact of the substrate and the catalyst, thereby reducing the contact resistance and enhancing the stability in OER; (3) The large specific surface area and porous structure can expose more active sites and promotes effective contact between electrolyte and catalyst, thereby improving the OER performance; (4) More importantly, the synergistic effects of Ni and Fe led to the high OER activity.

### **Conclusions**

In summary, a series of bimetallic NiFe-MOF was synthesized on NF using one-pot method. As expected, by introducing Fe ions, the inherent properties (conductivity and stability) of the

original Ni-MOF can be adjusted and change the electronic environment of Ni, making it more suitable for OER. The assynthesized NiFe-MOF/NF is directly used as OER electrocatalyst, it shows the best catalytic performance among the prepared catalysts and exhibits long-term stability. The excellent OER catalytic activity is due to the high conductivity, the large specific surface area, as well as the synergistic effects between Fe and Ni in the MOFs. This work may pave the way for the development of new MOFs as an efficient electrochemical catalyst.

Pitchiah Esakki Karthik, Hashikaa Rajan, Vasanth Rajendiran Jothi, Min Jae Ko,\* and Sung Chul Yi\*

In the design of structurally competent electrodes with prolonged lifecycles, a solid understanding of the gaseous hydrogen interaction in a metal lattice is highly desirable. During hydrogen evolution reaction, ingress of H severely affects the physical and mechanical properties of the material causing catastrophic brittle failures (hydrogen embrittlement). In this work, by chronoamperometry technique, an electrode with CoSe catalyst system is intentionally diffused with H to serve as a hydrogen stressed CoSe electrode. Surprisingly this H-embrittled CoSe electrode exhibits enhanced oxygen evolution reaction (OER) behavior as confirmed by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), impedance, and Tafel analysis, a cathodic shift of 80 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, impedance analysis reveals half the time of  $R_{ct}$ decreasing in the OER on H-embrittled CoSe than pristine CoSe. The Tafel slope of the H-embrittled CoSe exhibits of 30 mV, which is relatively lower than the pristine CoSe at OER condition. These results collectively support the enhanced activity of the H-embrittled CoSe electrode towards OER. Diffusion of hydrogen into metal lattice is confirmed by the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) fringes analysis, where a 22% decrease Q2 in the lattice distance is revealed by the H-embrittled CoSe catalyst.

evolution reaction (HER), specifically using the non-noble metal-based catalysts such as Co and Ni-based materials.[15-18] Among all the reported materials, metal chalcogenidesderived oxides are producing excellent activities towards the OER, in which metal selenides<sup>[19]</sup> (Se) exhibit excellent activity in the recent past.[20] Generally, the metal selenides are synthesized from the hydrothermal route or electrochemical deposition with Na<sub>2</sub>Se as a Se source.<sup>[21]</sup> Further, of the efficient water oxidation of Co cationic[22] is proven to be the best metal source<sup>[23–26]</sup> in water splitting reaction, where cobalt oxidation to form Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> contributed majorly in the water oxidation reaction, as shown in Equations (1)–(3):

$$3Co(OH)_2 + 2OH^- \rightarrow Co_3O_4 + 4H_2O + 2e^-$$
 (1)

$$Co_3O_4 + OH^- \rightarrow 3CoOOH + e^-$$
 (2)

$$CoOOH + OH^- \rightarrow CoO_2 + H_2O + e^-$$
 (3)

Compared to free metals, the oxide formation from metal chalcogenides are

more effective and inner chalcogenides can tune the surface electronic property to favor the cobalt oxide formation in an alkaline medium. Hence as a catalyst, cobalt selenide is a better choice to catalyze the water-oxidation reaction. [27] Recently the Huang group reported that the OER overpotential on  $CoSe_2@MoSe_2$  ( $\eta_{10~mA~cm2}$ ) is ca. 309 mV, [28] which is on par with benchmarking catalyst  $IrO_2$ . In addition to this, the CoSe nanobelt has exhibited an OER with an appreciable over potential (288 mV @ 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>). [27]

Fortunately, the same materials showed excellent activity towards the HER too. [29,30] The Lewis group reported the HER on CoSe with the overpotential of ( $\eta_{10~\text{mA cm2}}$ ) 135 mV, and the durability of the catalyst is up to 16 h. [31] Understanding this behavior, the bi-functionality (HER and OER) of catalytic behavior of CoSe is well studied. The Huang group demonstrated the bi-functional activity, they have shown the OER activity of this material with 0.300 and 0.380 V to get OER current of 100 and 500 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, respectively, in the HER, only 0.090 mV overpotential is needed to get 10 mA cm<sup>2</sup>. [21] In the cathodic HER, hydrogen embrittlement is an unwanted process, which affects the catalytic activity enormously, which is initiated by hydrogen percolation. [32] The hydrogen percolation

inside the catalyst lattice altered the material properties. Several proposed mechanisms explained this process such as: a) hydrogen diffusion; b) hydride formation; c) hydrogeninduced de-cohesion; d) hydrogen enhanced local plasticity; e) hydrogen-induced phase formation; and f) hydrogen enhancedstrain induced vacancy formation.[33] These processes have weakened the mechanical strength. Due to the weak mechanical strength and high lattice strain of the hydrogen embrittled surfaces are not useful to any further applications, further it is prone to get eroded easily. The H<sub>2</sub> percolation can induce a positive charge. The generated positive charge induced the negative charge and high electronegative oxygen atom adsorption. A catalyst positive charge may be generated through metal hydride formation in HER.[34,35] Hence we believed that the oxygen adsorption efficiency or water adsorption through the oxygen atom may be efficient on this surface. This adsorption mode could activate the OER catalytic behavior of the material. The oxophilicity is a crucial factor for OER, this oxophilicity will be diminished after prolong usage of the catalyst in OER. In contrast, the hydrogen embrittled surface enhances the corrosion process on the stainless; it is a clue for using this surface

Herein, we demonstrate the prolonged accelerated HER durability test of CoSe then the same material's OER catalytic activity has been examined. It showed higher activity than the pristine CoSe in linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), impedance, and Tafel slope analysis. The reason behind the enhanced activity could be correlated by the hydrogen embrittlement process, which was confirmed through TEM fringes measurement analysis. In this way, the used HER catalyst could be availed for the OER, where we found 22% decreases in the lattice distance of the H-embrittled CoSe(hydrogen stressed CoSe) catalyst.

## 2. Results and Discussion

#### 2.1. Pourbaix Diagram

A basic understanding of the CoSe catalyst electrochemical interface has been gained from the Pourbaix diagram of CoSe, as shown in Figure 1a,b. In which, the Co metal ion was converted to  $HCoO_2^-$  anion at the hydrogen evolution region, even at equilibrium conditions. The potential range of 0 to -1 V and beyond 1.23 in the alkaline medium (pH = 13), generally all cobalt species is in the form of  $HCoO_2^-$ .[36] The schematic representation showed the ideal condition of the CoSe compound in different electrochemical reactions (HER and OER), the nature of the compound has been predicted from the Pourbaix diagram, as shown in Figure 1b. From the lattice size of the cobalt oxide, the  $H_2$  molecule (0.120 A) can easily penetrate to the  $HCoO_2$  lattice, the layer distance 2.4169 A is sufficient for hydrogen diffusion during HER, as shown in Figure 1a. These dimensions highly support the hydrogen diffusion inside the CoSe lattice.

#### 2.2. XRD and Raman Characterizations

Understanding the  $H_2$  diffusion phenomena in water reduction reaction, the solid phase of prepared CoSe was initially char-

acterized using XRD analysis, the pattern was concurrent with the XRD pattern of literature reported CoSe (JCPDS card No. 52–1008). [37] Further, we have confirmed the formation of the CoSe phase with the help of Fullprof Suite Rietveld refinement analysis. **Figure 2**a has shown the experimental and refined XRD profile of CoSe with a  $\chi^2$  value of 8, where we found the similarity of the synthesized XRD profile with refined structure. Using this analysis, we have confirmed the formed compound was CoSe. The crystallographic information of the prepared sample has been derived using Rietveld Refinement analysis, given below (Figure 2a,b).

The Raman spectrum for the chemical analysis of CoSe coated on nickel foam electrodes was shown in Figure 2c,d, where the pristine compound exhibited the band at 260 cm<sup>-1</sup>; it was mainly from the surface adsorbed oxygen species. Peaks ≈500 cm<sup>-1</sup> confirmed the presence of cobalt metal ions from cobalt oxide. We have followed the report by Stella groups, where they assigned a cobalt oxide Raman stretching mode with appropriate notations. The appearance of the remaining bands in the range of 800 to 1200 cm<sup>-1</sup> confirmed the presence of cobalt and C-F stretching, the Nafion binder is the reason for the generation of the C-F stretching. The Nafion peak at this range has initially been analyzed by Pourcelly et al. where they found the strong Raman scattering peak at ≈800-1000 cm<sup>-1</sup>, which indicated the presence of Nafion in our catalyst ink composition. This peak has overlapped with the cobalt oxide peak, hence these peaks are not seen separately in the same region. [38-40] Further the bands at 1500 and 2900 cm<sup>-1</sup> were appeared from C-H stretching of the same binder. The C-H stretching and bending mode has recently been investigated using Raman spectrum by Corsetti et al.[38] where they analyzed the compound tetradecane using Raman scattering mode. The collective Raman bands of catalyst-coated electrodes have proven the presence of CoSe and Nafion. The drastic changes have been observed in the Raman analysis after the HER on CoSe catalyst. The prolonged HER on CoSe coated electrode, carbon element was observed on CoSe, in Raman scattering analyses the bands at 1300, 1600, 2600, and 2900 cm<sup>-1</sup>, these mainly appear from D, G, 2D, and D+G band of carbon, respectively. It confirmed the presence of carbon moiety on the catalyst surface. These bands have been fixed from the earlier report by Qian et al.[40] where they explained the generation of G and D bands from carbon surface. Generation of D and G band confirmed the complete carbon adsorption on the catalyst surface after 1 h HER in a same compartment. Due to high Raman scattering nature of the carbon materials, the peaks from metal oxides have been submerged.

#### 2.3. XPS Analyses

The carbon may be from a graphite counter electrode (explained in detail in Section S2, Supporting Information). This phenomenon was again confirmed using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, where the pristine CoSe compound did not have any carbon signature on the XPS survey spectrum. The carbon peak was seen on the survey spectrum of H-embrittled CoSe, shown in Figures S1, Supporting Information (a–d). A detailed description of the carbon element appearance from counter

electrode leaching during HER on the catalyst surface has been given in Section S2 and Movie S1, Supporting Information. The detailed chemical analysis of the freshly prepared CoSe electrode has been investigated by XPS analyses, the element Se, and Co peaks were seen clearly in the binding energy range of ca. 180 and 790 eV, respectively, in the survey spectrum. It was investigated using elemental Co and Se scanning in the above regions, shown in **Figure 3**a–f.

The cobalt scan of the pristine compound exhibited peaks at binding energies of 2P3/2 at 780.5 eV and 2P1/2 796.2 eV with the average full width half maximum (FWHM of these peaks are ca. 1.6) which implied that the presence of Co2<sup>+</sup>. In addition to this, a cobalt compound produced satellite peaks in XPS scan in the range of 760 to 810 eV. Herein the corresponding satellite peaks of pristine cobalt appeared in the binding energy of 784.8 and 803.2 eV which corresponded to the 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 satellite peaks, respectively. The presence of selenium elements has been confirmed through 3p and 3d scanning in the binding energy range of 155 to 175 eV and 50 to 66 eV, respectively, as shown in Figures 3d,e, and 3f. The peaks are at 54.1 eV, 55.2 eV, 161.4, and 167.4 that could be assigned to 3d 5/2, 3d 3/2, 3p3/2, and 3p1/2, respectively. After the HER on CoSe, a similar cobalt scan pattern has appeared again. The slight positive binding energy shifts were (ca. 3 eV) observed in 3p and, 3d scan of

selenium conveyed surface oxidation of Se in the alkaline medium during electrolysis, which is mostly in the form of selenite (SeO3).

In addition to Co and Se peaks, the C and O peaks were also seen on the H-embrittled-CoSe. The hydroxide adsorption followed by the oxidation of selenium and cobalt in the alkaline medium at electrochemical oxidation conditions may be a reason for the presence of oxygen elements on the H-embrittled-CoSe catalyst surface.

#### **2.4. Electron Microscope Analyses**

In many cases, the catalyst morphological features have been changed for the type of electrochemical reaction. The catalyst morphological feature of pristine and H-embrittled CoSe and their elemental distribution were analyzed through electron microscopic analyses and corresponding electron dispersive X-ray (E-DAX) mapping, as shown in **Figures 4**a, **5**a, and Figure S2, Supporting Information. Amount of cobalt and selenium leaching during electrochemical water splitting reaction has been analyzed through ICP-MS analysis shown in Table S2, Supporting Information. A high amount carbon has been detected in HER experiment, this is because of the leaching of the graphite counter electrode. There are no considerable changes in the morphological feature seen on post HER CoSe catalyst in FESEM analyses. At the same time, the particle-like feature has disappeared after the HER on CoSe. It could be understood that the HER facilitates the particle-to-particle interaction. The clear cuboid shape particles were seen on the pristine CoSe, whereas these particles were absent on the H-embrittled-CoSe catalyst, as shown in Figures 4a and 5a. The average length of the cuboid particle has been calculated as 1200 nm, and the width of the particle was 400 nm. In the EDX elemental mapping, the pristine compound showed Co, Se, O, and C elements. Though the percentage of the oxygen element cannot be accurately calculated through EDX mapping, this analysis can give an idea to understand the relative amount of oxygen, as shown in Figures S2a, Supporting Information. This characterization conveyed the increases of the amount of oxygen percentage after HER with CoSe, while the elemental mapping of pristine and H-embrittled-CoSe explicated the same as shown in Figure S2b, Supporting Information.

Considering the small size of the hydrogen atom and the diffusion nature of the proton and hydrogen atoms, the hydrogen can easily penetrate to the metal lattice, which enhances the lattice strain, and the lattice distance decreases because of the hydrogen atom stress. It has been seen in the lattice distance measurement through fringes measurements, as shown in Figures 4(b–e) and 5(b–e) where we found decreases in the lattice distance such as the average lattice distance value decreases from 0.272 to 0.210 nm. The 0.06 nm decreases can create a huge lattice strain in the CoSe lattice, which may be the reason to enhance the OER activity by an 80 mV decreasing overpotential at a 10 mA cm−<sup>2</sup> current density range.

Further, the material property changes at a nanoscale level were investigated through transmission electron microscopy (TEM), the images and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of compounds have shown in Figures 4f and 5f conveyed the nature and collection of particles morphology. The particle morphology of pristine and H-embrittled-CoSe is presented in particle clusters. Due to the surface charge of the CoSe the zeta potential of the prepared particle was observed as 18.4 mV. The prepared CoSe is not as stable as Co2O3; the calculated zeta potential also confirmed the least stability of the prepared catalyst. Moreover, the pristine CoSe displayed consistent surface potential, it has been understood from the standard deviation of zeta potential (0.511 mV), which conveyed that the homogeneous nature of particle properties. Surprisingly, the surface potential of the particles has been changed to −7 mV and an inconsistent surface potential in comparison with pristine compound, the standard deviation of the values is 0.81 mV, as presented in Figure S3, Supporting Information. The oxygen affinity with cobalt as well as selenium promoted the oxygen adsorption on the catalyst surface, which changes the surface polarity and charges, which was further disturbed by hydrogen penetration and carbon particle adsorption, albeit hydrogen adsorption was thoroughly studied in the area of hydrogen storage with many materials such as metal-organic framework, porous carbon materials, and metals. Mostly, the hydrogen penetration through the metal lattice and other compounds is majorly considered hydrogen blistering and embrittlement. Unfortunately, this process could not be directly investigated

using electron microscopy or spectroscopic analysis, based on the fundamental understanding of hydrogen such as oxidation state of the material, lattice void gap, hydrogen ion size, etc. Fortunately, the crystallinity of the material is highly disturbed by this process, hence studying crystalline nature and lattice distance through high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) analyses may provide some insights to comprehend this phenomenon. Recent theoretical evidence of this process by stress and strain analysis with TEM by Wang et al.[41] The SAED pattern of pristine CoSe explicit that the polycrystalline nature of the materials, the corresponding d-spacing of the material has been denoted in the ring pattern, the distance from the center of the circle is in concurrent with the d-space of the CoSe, as shown in Figure 4e. This d-space value is visible

in the freshly prepared CoSe pristine compound up to 4 planes (111, 112, 210, and 122), at the same time after the HER, the d-spacing was not seen clearly up to 3 planes such as (111, 112, 210), as shown in Figure 5e. The influence of the hydrogen penetration in the CoSe lattice would be making disorder; interestingly Anantharaj et al. recently reported the losing crystalline nature of the material during HER.<sup>[42]</sup>

This lattice strain can affect the conductivity of the molecule, which was investigated using diffused reflectance spectroscopy (DRS). In the electrochemical application, we could not see any conductivity changes in impedance analysis as well as voltammogram features, hence we believed the optical method could be a choice to study the conductivity of the compound. Using the Tauc plot from diffused reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), we have analyzed the materials, the pristine and after HER catalyst has not shown any distinct peak in the lower energy region, the corresponding Tauc plot has been shown in Figure S4, Supporting Information. The optical band gap (direct bandgap) was calculated from CoSe (3.6 eV) to H-embrittled-CoSe (2.3 eV). This result supports the improvement in electrical conductivity after HER. An increase in the conductivity could be understood from the lattice fringes distance measurement also. Closer lattice fringes may enhance the electron transfer through the atom easily, which improves the conductivity, this electrical conductivity enhancement can further support the OER catalytic activity enhancement. In an impedance analysis, the ionic conductivity was also increased, as shown in Figure S5, Supporting Information.

## 2.5. Electro-Chemical/Catalytic Studies

The electrochemical activity of the CoSe catalyst was investigated using a carbon gas diffusion electrode as a support, the CoSe thin film coating was achieved by the simple drop-casting method. The electrochemical investigation was performed using the electrochemical potential sweep technique in the potential region of 0.9 to 1.4 V, where a Co<sup>2+/3+</sup> electron transfer couple occurred.<sup>[43]</sup> Fortunately, the electrochemical electron transfer of this couple in an alkaline medium is reversible, hence the surface electrochemical relation, as shown in Equation (1) can be applied in the redox reaction to identify the electrochemical active Co species:

$$i_{peak} = \frac{n^2 F^2 A C \vartheta}{4 R T} \tag{4}$$

where i is the peak current, n is the number of electron transfer (1), F is the Faraday constant (96 485 C/M), A is the area of the electrode (1 cm²), C is the surface concentration (M cm², v-scan rate (V·s¹), R is the gas constant (8.314 J K¹), and T is the temperature (300 K).

From the above relationship, [44] in a surface electrochemical electron transfer, the current is directionally proportional to the scan rate (v). Using this relation, one can easily derive the surface concentration by plotting peak current versus scan rate, as presented in Figures S6 and S7, Supporting Information.

The slope of the graph is nothing but  $\frac{n^2F^2AC}{4RT}$ , substituting

other constants, we have calculated the surface concentration. Though these electrochemical reactions are smooth and reversible on both the oxidation and reduction sides, the kinetics of the electron transfer has not been completely reversible. Ideally, the reversible surface electrochemical reaction has shown the  $\Delta E_{\rm p}$  value zero, which is known to be a mirror peak shape (anodic peak has to be similar to cathodic peak when the proper electrochemical surface reaction happened). Generally, it was not seen in many cases, except some controlled fast electron transfer kinetic reaction, which was studied by Murray et al., [45] in ferrocene compound chemically adsorbed on Pt/PtO surface. Herein, we have seen that the  $\Delta E_{\rm p}$  varies with scan rate in the range of 0.06 to 0.12 V. The variation in the  $\Delta E_{\rm p}$  could attribute directly to the electron transfer kinetics, which is generally higher at the higher scan rate. In the slow electron transfer process, the potential sweeping time scale is faster than the electron transfer at the interface which will show a higher peak potential than a Nernstian peak potential. This effect is profoundly seen at higher scan voltammetry with a lower electron transfer rate redox reaction. In the CoSe case,  $Co^{2+/3+}$  redox kinetics<sup>[43]</sup> is not as facile to get a proper surface electrochemical signal.

The trend followed on the pristine CoSe compound up to 40 mV·s<sup>-1</sup> after that the  $\Delta E_{\rm p}$  has not changed much. In the case of H-embrittled CoSe compound, it followed the same but after 70 to 90 mV it again increases proportionally with the scan rate. This is due to the formation of the cobalt oxide (Co<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) hydrogen and some carbon particles' accumulation and arising surface non-homogeneities. It was partially discussed in previous literature, unfortunately, the complete electrochemical picture and their influence on the electrocatalytic activity was not studied well. In general, the oxygen vacancies are prone to activate the OER. Concerning this trend scientists achieved to make oxygen vacancies through different methods such as: 1) reductive elimination of oxygen; [46] 2) pyrolysis; [47] 3) electrochemical reduction;<sup>[48]</sup> 4) laser-assisted method;<sup>[49]</sup> etc. The catalytic activity of the materials highly depends on oxygen vacancies, electrochemical OER catalyst activity is also highly controlled by oxygen vacancies. During HER, as formed Co<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> in alkaline medium was undergone in a reduction process by applying the cathodic potential. It showed appreciable activity than the pristine CoSe compound. The OER activity of the pristine compound was observed using LSV (and Tafel), shown in Figure 6a and b, where the pristine compound showed the onset potential of 1.4 V versus RHE and 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> achieved at the overpotential of 0.370 V ( $\eta = 1.5$  V). After continuous hydrogen, evolution reaction was performed on the CoSe catalyst using chronoamperometry techniques, as shown in Figure S7, Supporting Information, both the onset and overpotential at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> were shifted 0.08 V cathodic direction. The cathodic shift of the potential of the OER LSV graph on H-embrittled-CoSe conveyed the activation of the catalyst through a HER. The HER was initially observed using LSV voltammogram techniques on the CoSe pristine compound, as shown in Figure 6a, which was attributed to the 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> at 0.1 V overpotential. Applying this potential on the CoSe catalyst, the HER was performed at the same potential for 12 000 s. The prepared pristine CoSe HER activity was preliminarily investigated using LSV experiment, as shown in Figure S8, Supporting Information.

In this way, the hydrogen stressed CoSe was further investigated in OER, as shown in Figure 6a. From the LSV curve, the activation of OER of hydrogen stressed catalyst could be understood, further, it was confirmed using AC-impedance analysis, presented in Figure 6g, getting a clear understanding. The Ac impedance analysis was performed at four different potentials such as 1.7, 1.8, 1.9, and 2 V, as shown in Figure 6c–f. At these potentials, the OER reactions are prone to happen on both the

electrochemical rate were the only differences observed. Since all the electrodes are under the same condition and reaction. the electrochemical rate can be directly correlated with  $R_{ct}$ (charge transfer resistance of the interface). The electrochemical interface has been simulated with an equivalent circuit using impedance fitting at a 1.7 V applied potential as shown in Figure S5a, Supporting Information. At higher potential, the disturbance caused from bubble formation, we have chosen a lower applied potential to distinguish two catalyst activities and electronic equivalent structures. The  $R_s$  and  $R_{ct}$  values were seen from Ac-impedance analyses, which are presented in Figure 6g It also confirmed the increase in the OER activity of the CoSe catalyst after prolonged HER. The changes of the  $R_s$ and  $R_{ct}$  considerably on hydrogen stressed catalyst surface in the OER, which has been presented in Figure 6 and Figure S5, Supporting Information. From Figure S5, Supporting Information, the decreases in the charge transfer resistances in every potential was seen, the steady decrease in the  $R_{ct}$  concerning increase in the applied potential was seen on hydrogen stressed CoSe catalyst, which was not seen on the solution resistance (R<sub>s</sub>). The first derivative graph of the changes in the charge transfer resistance  $R_{ct}$  for potential and solution resistance are shown in Figure S5b, Supporting Information. In the interface, the electron transfer highly depends on the nature of the catalyst surface; the inner catalyst electron transfer resistance is not controlled by applied potential. Hence the changes in  $R_s$  are not

directly proportional to the applied potential. Finally, the sta-

bility of the catalyst was investigated using chronoamperometry

analysis, where it was showing a constant current up to 15 000 s

as shown in Figure 6h, which was in comparison with the lit-

erature reported CoSe catalyst. Interestingly, the hydrogen

embrittled surface<sup>[50]</sup> was not affected in the OER condition.

Most of the metal electrode interface generated the open circuit potential  $\approx 0.4$  to  $\approx 0.6$  V. Hence, all the OER happened at high field condition, which was having an anodic shift from the equilibrium potential  $\approx 0.8$  V. Considering this phenomenon, the Tafel relationship could be applied to present the electrochemical kinetics of the reaction. The relationship is as shown in Equation (5):<sup>[51]</sup>

$$\eta = \frac{RT}{\alpha nF} \ln \left( \frac{i}{i_0} \right) \tag{5}$$

Where  $\eta$  is the overpotential, T is the temperature,  $\alpha$  is the transfer coefficient, n is the number of electron transfer, i is the current, and  $i_0$  is the exchange current. Normally, the Tafel slope was calculated at the onset potential of the OER region, which gives the curve nature. Hence, it contained an infinite number of slopes, but many researchers have reported the possible average slope from the curve, which is maintained as low as possible. Though the number of electron transfers cannot directly be represented through Tafel, many scientists have reported the same. Understanding this nature of the phenomenon of electron transfer and recently

|--------|------------------------|----------|-------|----------|------|

| 2.     | Hydrogen stressed CoSe | 60       | 0.992 | 90       | 0.66 |

Compton et al.,<sup>[52]</sup> reported the importance of the transfer coefficient in the electrochemical reaction. Since we do not know the exact number of electron transfers at a given period, the multiplication of transfer coefficient and the number of electrons parameter can only be related. Considering infinity number of slopes present in the Tafel plot, we have measured two different slopes in two regions such as: 1) nearby onset potential region; and 2) 0.2 V higher than onset region, where we observed constant incremental current concerning potential scanning, these regions are named region (1) and (2), respectively. The measured slopes are tabulated (Table 1) given below:

$$n\alpha = 2.303 \frac{vRT}{Tafel\ slope * F} \tag{6}$$

Using the above relationship, as displayed in Equation (6), the  $(n\alpha)$  transfer coefficient correlate the transfer coefficient of the catalyst in the same reaction at a similar condition. Since the conditions and reactions are similar, the influence of the stoichiometric number is negligible (v). Due to a lack of knowledge of the interfacial electron transfer mechanism, the parameter of the stoichiometric number (v) is always considered as unity.<sup>[52]</sup> Based on the above discussion, one can directly compare the electron transfer kinetics of the catalyst. Compared to the pristine CoSe, after the HER, the catalyst was activated towards OER, which was evident from the value  $(n\alpha)$  1.984 at the onset region. In the same region, pristine CoSe exhibited 0.992 only, as shown in Figure 6b. There were no changes observed at the higher potential in region (2), it conveyed that after activation both the catalysts are following the same path. The HER activation only affects the lower activation region only.

### 3. Conclusions

In the summary of this work, we confirmed that the HER on CoSe catalyst activates the OER, which has been investigated through the voltammogram, impedance, and Tafel analyses. The reason behind the activation was understood by the hydrogen embrittlement of the catalyst. The embrittled catalyst morphology was investigated using HR-TEM fringes analyses and the corresponding SAED pattern. These changes may happen mostly from lattice strain from the  $\rm H_2$  molecule percolation inside the lattice during the HER. This percolation was considered as an unwanted reaction. In addition to that, some of the carbon materials were generated from the counter graphite electrode, which was partially adsorbed on the catalyst site. This phenomenon could also be a reason for the activation

The complete analysis and the influence of the carbon and hydrogen embrittlement in the OER of CoSe catalyst need rigorous experimental analyses, such as integrated differential phase contraction (i-DPC) TEM,[53] or X-ray, and neutron diffraction with Hirshfeld atom refinement (HAR) analyses.[54]

In this research, we have successfully synthesized a Ni—Fe—P/h-BN catalyst through a simple one-step electrodeposition method for efficient water splitting in a KOH electrolytic cell. Our prepared Ni—Fe—P/h-BN catalyst showcased exceptional electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), with an overpotential of only 210 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. Notably, this value is significantly lower compared to 248 mV observed for Ni—Fe—P/Fe without h-BN and also superior to the results reported for other catalysts. Furthermore, through the ball milling, we further enhanced the OER performance of the catalyst, achieving an impressive overpotential of 200 mV at the same density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. The exceptional OER performance displayed by the Ni—Fe—P/h-BN composite is attributable to the synergistic effects of Ni—Fe—P and h-BN. Furthermore, the introduction of a heterojunction between h-BN and Ni—Fe—P serves to further enhance the OER capability of the catalyst. This investigation introduces a straightforward and effective approach for fabricating cost-effective and high-performance electrocatalysts intended for water electrolysis.

#### 1. Introduction

In recent years, electrocatalytic water splitting has received extensive attention as a research hotspot. Electrolysis of water includes two half reactions: hydrogen evolution at the cathode (HER) and oxygen evolution at the anode (OER). Both reactions are carried out simultaneously, and a thermodynamic potential of 1.23 V is required for the reaction under ideal conditions [1, 2]. However, due to the lag of the anodic oxygen evolution reaction in the actual production, there is always a certain overpotential in the reaction.

In order to reduce the overpotential, noble metal-based electrocatalysts, for example, Pt for HER and IrO<sub>2</sub> or RuO<sub>2</sub> for OER, are the most effective solutions at present [3]. Because of scarce content and high price, it cannot be widely used in practical production. Transition metals and alloys are expected to be used in practical production because of their good stability and abundant reserves [4]. The catalyst based on nickel/cobalt/iron is considered to be the most probably catalyst to replace noble metals, especially nickel base materials [5, 6, 7]. In the bimetallic

component catalyst, Xiao et al. [8] found that there is a synergistic effect between Fe and Ni due to the (Ni, Fe)OOH system: high-spin d4Fe (IV) stabilizes O radicals through exchange interactions to effectively produce it, while closed-shell d6Ni (IV) catalyzes O—O coupling. The synergy provides excellent performance of Ni—Fe-based catalysts for OER. Todoroki and Wadayama [9] synthesized Ni—Fe hydroxide/oxide heterostructure on 316 stainless steel (SS) substrate by constant current density electrolysis. It was found that the electrocatalysts had high oxygen evolution reaction activity, and the OER overpotential at  $10\,\mathrm{mA\,cm}^{-2}$  was estimated to be  $254\,\mathrm{mV}$  at  $20^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ , which was obviously better than the standard OER catalyst.

Given that the electrochemical activity of Ni—Fe-based catalysts still falls short of meeting the desired benchmarks, the integration of nonmetallic elements like sulfur, phosphorus, oxygen, borate, and selenium has commonly been employed to enhance their performance [10, 11, 12, 13, 14]. P has proved to be a very effective compound. Metal phosphides, in particular, show great potential for both HER and OER in alkaline media due to their good electrical conductivity and "ensemble

effect." However, the high kinetic potential still limits the development of Ni—Fe alloys [15, 16, 17].

Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), as a two-dimensional (2D) material, is similar to graphene in structure and has similar lattice constants [18, 19]. There are sp2 covalent bonds between B and N atoms in the layer and weak van der Waals bonds between the layers [20]. Its application in catalysis is mainly based on chemical and thermal stability and good thermal conductivity [21]. In recent years, it has been found that h-BN, as a catalyst or assistant, can form a heterogeneous structure with some substances, so as to form a kind of cooperative catalysis and improve the catalytic performance of the catalyst. Lyalin et al. [22] investigated the catalytic activity of hexagonal boron nitride monolayers deposited on Au electrode surfaces and modified by small-plane Au eight clusters for oxygen reduction reactions. The results show that gold nanoparticles deposited on the h-BN/Au surface can provide catalytic active sites for ORR at the peripheral interface of the support. It should be noted that the pure Au electrode has almost no ORR activity, and the independent h-BN is inert; therefore, there must be a synergistic effect between h-BN and Au, which plays a key role in ORR. Wu et al. [23] obtained a new magnetic Ni@h-BN composite by uniformly loading Ni nanoparticles on h-BN nanosheets by a simple solvothermal method. The prepared samples have high catalytic performance for the production of H<sub>2</sub> from aqueous aminoborane[23]. Li et al. [24] developed an innovative composite photocatalyst comprising layered h-BN and TiO<sub>2</sub> (h-BN/TiO<sub>2</sub>). Due to its distinctive heterostructure, the composite exhibited significantly enhanced photocatalytic degradation efficiency for Rhodamine B (RhB). Kumari et al. [25] prepared h-BN-MoS<sub>2</sub> heterostructures by a simple hydrothermal method to enhance the photoreduction of CO<sub>2</sub>. Under visible light irradiation, the maximum methanol yield of the obtained composite reached 5,994  $\mu$  mol g<sup>-1</sup> cat, which was 3.8 times that of pure MoS<sub>2</sub>. In addition, h-BN itself also has some catalytic activity. Li et al. 's [26] experiment showed that benzene could generate p-terphenyl after adding h-BN nanoparticles at a temperature of 400°C, which proved that h-BN nanoparticles have catalytic properties for specific substances. In summary, the introduction of h-BN to construct a heterogeneous interface helps to improve the performance of the catalyst, which inspires us to use h-BN to construct a new amorphous/crystal interface in electrolytic water to prepare higher performance electrocatalysts of OER.

In this study, the electrocatalyst Ni—Fe—P/h-BN was synthesized via a straightforward electroplating technique. The composite coating of Ni—Fe—P/h-BN was achieved through the codeposition of h-BN powder alongside the Ni—Fe—P alloy onto an iron substrate. The impact of varying amounts and particle sizes of h-BN on the catalytic activity was systematically explored. The resultant Ni—Fe—P/h-BN composite catalyst demonstrated outstanding electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER).

# 2. Experimental

2.1. Pretreatment of Iron Sheet. An iron sheet measuring  $10 \text{ mm} \times 20 \text{ mm}$  served as the support for the catalyst. Prior

to the electrodeposition process, the iron sheet was submerged in anhydrous ethanol to eliminate any surface oils. Subsequently, the sheet was immersed in hydrochloric acid solutions, with volume concentration ratios of concentrated hydrochloric acid to water set at 1:1 and 3:7, respectively, to facilitate the removal of surface oxides and to activate the iron surface.

- 2.2. Preparation of Ni—Fe—P Electrocatalyst. The electrode-position procedure was conducted within a three-electrode cell setup, employing a single Fe sheet as the cathode and two Pt plates as the anodes. Following pretreatment, the Fe sheet was promptly introduced into the Ni—Fe—P electrolytes. The aqueous electrolyte used for electrodeposition was formulated with the following components:  $250\,\mathrm{g\,L^{-1}}$  NiSO4  $\cdot$  6H<sub>2</sub>O,  $50\,\mathrm{g\,L^{-1}}$  NiCl<sub>2</sub>·6H<sub>2</sub>O,  $50\,\mathrm{g\,L^{-1}}$  FeSO<sub>4</sub>  $\cdot$  7H<sub>2</sub>O,  $30\,\mathrm{g\,L^{-1}}$  H<sub>3</sub>BO<sub>3</sub>, and  $15\,\mathrm{g\,L^{-1}}$  Na<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>·12H<sub>2</sub>O. The bath's pH was adjusted to 1.5 using a small quantity of 2.0 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> solution. Electrodeposition was carried out under a current density of 300 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> for a duration of 60 min, with continuous stirring at 200 rpm and a temperature of 10°C.
- 2.3. Preparation of Ni—Fe—P/h-BN Electrocatalyst. The h-BN particles with different content and particle sizes were added to the plating solution. The catalysts added with h-BN particles before and after ball milling were named Ni—Fe—P/h-BN and Ni—Fe—P/h-BN-bm, respectively. The h-BN particles were uniformly dispersed in the plating solution by ultrasonic stirring, and the h-BN needs to be stirred continuously during the plating process to maintain a uniform state.
- 2.4. Electrochemical Testing. In this section of the paper, all electrochemical tests were conducted in a standard threeelectrode cell at room temperature. The working electrode used was the prepared Ni-Fe-P/h-BN catalyst with dimensions of  $1 \times 1$  cm<sup>2</sup>. The counter electrode employed was a Pt plate, the reference electrode used was an Hg/HgO electrode with 1 M KOH as the electrolyte. To ensure consistency and comparability, all potentials in the study were calibrated and converted to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale using the following formula: E (RHE) = E (vs. Hg/HgO) +0.9268 V. The polarization curve of the sample was tested by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used to test the electrochemical impedance of the sample in the electrolyte, and the measurement was performed in the frequency range of 0.01 Hz–100 kHz. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was used to test the electrode reaction. The value obtained by linear fitting of the CV curve was the double-layer capacitance value C<sub>dl</sub>, and then the electrochemical active surface area ECSA of the sample was obtained. The stability of the samples under long-term electrochemical reaction was tested by chronopotentiometry (CP).

#### 3. Results and Discussion

3.1. Characterization of Ni—Fe—P/h-BN Catalyst. The morphology of h-BN before and after ball milling is shown in Figure 1. From Figures 1(b) and 1(d), it can be seen that the shape of the particles is changed from flaky granular mixture

<span id="page-2-0"></span>FIGURE 1: SEM images of h-BN powder before (a and b) and after (c and d) ball milling.

to a single small granular shape, although the picture is not so good due to the poor conductivity of h-BN itself and the instrument. Figure 2 is the SEM image of Ni—Fe—P/h-BN sample. It can be seen from Figures 2(a) and 2(c) that the surface of the catalyst is rough and porous, and there are many cotton-like particles with cracks and gaps. However, it is evident that the particles on the surface of the Ni—Fe—P/ 0.6 g h-BN-bm composite catalyst are smaller.

It can be seen from Figures 2(b) and 2(d) that the Ni—Fe—P/0.6 g h-BN composite catalyst coating particles are honeycomb shaped, while the surface of the Ni—Fe—P/0.6 g h-BN-bm composite catalyst is coated with nanosheets. Both composite catalysts have very homogeneous and porous surfaces. These two multilayered nanostructures increase the surface area of the coating, which may have a larger active surface area and increase the adhesion site of the catalyst.

The crystal structure and surface composition of Ni—Fe—P/h-BN were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), as shown in Figure 3(a). The XRD patterns of the Ni—Fe—P/h-BN and Ni—Fe—P/h-BN-bm are in perfect agreement with the peaks of FeNi<sub>3</sub> (PDF#38-0419), indicating the main component on the surface of the catalyst is FeNi<sub>3</sub> [27, 28]. Since the three strong peaks of h-BN (PDF#89-1498) are very close to those of FeNi<sub>3</sub>, further research is needed to determine whether the coating contains h-BN. The amorphous characteristics of Ni—Fe—P/h-BN are very obvious, and there is a bulge peak between 30° and 40°, while Ni—Fe—P/h-BN-bm does not. This may be due to the fact that ball milling reduces a large number of disordered crystal peaks and makes the amorphous

characteristics more obvious [29]. Amorphous materials have abundant defect sites, and their atomic arrangement has the characteristics of short-range order and long-range disorder, providing more and more efficient active sites. From Figures 3(b) and 3(c), we can see that the content of Fe is the most, followed by Ni, P again, and the content of B and N is less. This is determined by their content in the electrodeposition aqueous electrolyte.

High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) image of Ni—Fe—P/0.6 g h-BN-bm is shown in Figure 4, and "a" and "b" regions in the image are enlarged to obtain clearer lattice fringes and the composition of the special hierarchical nanostructures was further investigated. The lattice spacing of Figure 4 (region a) is 0.209 nm, corresponding to the (111) plane of h-BN. The lattice spacing of Figure 4 (region b) is 0.204 nm, corresponding to the (111) plane of FeNi<sub>3</sub> [28]. Figure 4 (region c) shows interface between h-BN and FeNi<sub>3</sub>. We can see from the image that the content of FeNi<sub>3</sub> is more and more concentrated, while the content of h-BN is less and dispersed in various regions. There is no obvious interface between the amorphous or low crystallinity structure and the crystal.

The surface elemental composition and chemical states of both Ni—Fe—P/h-BN and Ni—Fe—P/h-BN-bm were investigated using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The influence of ball milling on the Ni 2p, Fe 2p, P 2p, B 1s, and N 1s regions was confirmed by comparing the XPS spectra of the Ni—Fe—P/h-BN and Ni—Fe—P/h-BN-bm catalysts. The surface analysis revealed the presence of Ni, Fe, P, B, and

N elements on the sample surface, consistent with the EDS results. In the Ni 2p spectrum of Ni—Fe—P/h-BN (Figure 5(a)), two spin—orbit peaks at 856.1 and 873.8 eV corresponded to Ni 2p3/2 and Ni 2p1/2, respectively, along with two satellite peaks at 861.9 and 880.6 eV. Compared with the peak position of Ni 2p in Ni—Fe—P/h-BN-bm, there is no significant change [30]. Notably, the Ni—Fe—P/h-BN spectrum exhibited peaks at 852.2 and 868.7 eV (Figure 5(a)) associated with metallic Ni or Ni<sup>0</sup>, absent in the Ni—Fe—P/h-BN-bm spectra. This indicates that the h-BN after ball milling is beneficial to the conversion of Ni<sup>0</sup> to Ni<sup>2+</sup>. Fe 2p1/2 and Fe 2p3/2 peaks (Ni—Fe—P/h-BN) were observed at 725.4 and 711.9 eV in Figure 5(b), respectively, which were mainly composed of Fe<sup>2+</sup>. The Fe 2p3/2 peak of Ni—Fe—P/h-BN-bm catalyst is divided into Fe<sup>3+</sup>, Fe<sup>2+</sup>, and Fe<sup>0</sup>, indicating

that the ball-milled h-BN promotes the emergence of high valence Fe atoms. Such atoms are beneficial to the oxygen evolution performance. In the P 2p region (Figure 5(c)), the peak at 133.3 eV was identified, while B 1s and N 1s peaks at 190.8 and 398.3 eV were seen in Figures 5(d) and 5(e) (Ni—Fe—P/h-BN). For P2p in the Ni—Fe—P/h-BN-bm spectra, it is convoluted into three peaks, two of which correspond to the P—O bond (132.4 and 133.2 eV) and one to the M—P bond[31]. For B1s in the Ni—Fe—P/h-BN-bm spectra, it can be deconvoluted into three peaks, which are B elemental (187.5 eV), B suboxide (189.8 eV), and B<sup>3+</sup> (191.6 eV) [32, 33]. B<sup>3+</sup> is the B in h-BN. For N1s, the trend is essentially the same in the Ni—Fe—P/h-BN and Ni—Fe—P/h-BN-bm spectra. The comprehensive spectrum revealed a higher Ni 2 p peak in Ni—Fe—P/h-BN-bm spectra

compared to Ni—Fe—P/h-BN, indicating an increased Ni content. It is well-known that the Ni element is very conducive to the oxygen evolution reaction.

3.2. OER Performance of Ni—Fe—P/h-BN. In Figure 6, the OER activity of Ni—Fe—P/h-BN catalysts with the different contents of h-BN was tested by LSV curves, EIS measurements and Tafel plots. Obviously, the Ni—Fe—P/h-BN catalyst with 0.6 g h-BN addition has the best OER performance, with the lowest overpotential, the minimum impedance arc radius, and Tafel slope. In addition, the Ni—Fe—P/0.6 g h-BN electrode illustrated in Table 1 has an overpotential of 210 mV at a

current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, which is significantly smaller than other catalysts with different h-BN content and most of the OER catalysts with high activity reported so far [1]. The Ni—Fe—P/0.6 g h-BN catalyst also has good oxygen evolution

performance at high potential, 250 mV at 100 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. This result shows that the addition of h-BN makes the amorphous Ni—Fe—P catalyst obtain more excellent OER activity.

In addition, EIS was performed in 1 M KOH solution to further evaluate the OER kinetics of the corresponding electrodes. The EIS of the above electrocatalysts is compared in Figure 6(b). It can be seen from the figure that compared with

Ni—Fe—P/Fe and Ni—Fe—P/X g h-BN (X = 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1.0), Ni—Fe—P/0.6 g h-BN has the minimum impedance arc radius, indicating that the co-electrodeposition of h-BN contributes to the effective transfer of charge.

Tafel slope is also one of the important means to study the dynamic process of OER. The Tafel slope of Ni—Fe—P/0.6 g h-BN is only 23.7 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>, which is 36.4 and 41.9 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>

smaller than that of Ni—Fe—P/Fe and  $IrO_2/NF$ , respectively, indicating that Ni—Fe—P/0.6 g h-BN has excellent OER kinetic performance.

The long-term stability of Ni—Fe—P/Fe and Ni—Fe—P/0.6 g h-BN samples was evaluated by chronopotentiometry (Figure 6(d)). At a current density of 50 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, water decomposition tests were performed for both in a solution of 1 M KOH at 90,000 s. The potential measured at 50 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> did not change significantly during the 90,000 s test, indicating that both have excellent long-term stability for water decomposition.

The particle size also has an important influence on the preparation and performance of the catalyst. Appropriate particle size can effectively improve the performance of the catalyst. Generally speaking, the smaller the particle size, the larger the specific surface area and the higher the catalytic activity. Baumung et al. [34] studied the OER catalytic activity of lithium manganate with different particle sizes in sodium hydroxide electrolyte. The Faraday efficiency of micron powder is only 25%. However, the Faraday efficiency of nanopowders is at least 75% [34]. Therefore, this paper uses the ball milling method to refine the powder to improve the performance of the catalyst.

Figure 7 shows the LSV and EIS curves of Ni—Fe—P/h-BN catalysts (0.6 g) before and after ball milling. It can be seen from Table 2 that the ball milling has a certain promotion effect on the performance of the catalyst. It not only reduces the oxygen evolution overpotential but also reduces the radius of the capacitive arc, as shown in Figure 7.

Figure 8 is constructed from CV curves acquired at varying scan rates (30–50 mV s<sup>-1</sup>). The disparity between the anodic and cathodic currents, corresponding to the intermediate potential of -0.05 V vs. RHE, is fitted with the applied scan rate. The gradient of the linear relationship in the figure represents the electrochemical double-layer capacitance ( $C_{\rm dl}$ ). A larger  $C_{\rm dl}$  value signifies a rougher electrode surface. Then, in accordance with the evaluation formula for electrochemical active area (ESCA), which is ESCA =  $C_{\rm cll}/Cs$  (where Cs is a specific capacitance value of 0.040 mF cm<sup>-2</sup> in a 1.0 M KOH solution), the electrochemical active area is deduced. Figures 8(a), 8(b), and 8(c) show the CV curves of several catalysts measured at a constant sweep speed of 30, 35, 40, 45, and 50 mV s<sup>-1</sup> from 0.32 to 0.42 V. In Figure 8(d), Ni—Fe—P/0.6 g h-BN-bm exhibits a higher  $C_{\rm cll}$  value (2.13 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>) compared to Ni—Fe—P/0.6 g

h-BN (1.39 mF cm $^{-2}$ ) and Ni—Fe—P/Fe (1.17 mF cm $^{-2}$ ). Consequently, the calculated ECSA values are  $53.25\,\mathrm{cm}^2$  for Ni—Fe—P/0.6 g h-BN-bm,  $34.75\,\mathrm{cm}^2$  for Ni—Fe—P/0.6 g h-BN, and  $29.25\,\mathrm{cm}^2$  for Ni—Fe—P/Fe. This outcome underscores that the introduction of ball-milled h-BN is conducive to exposing more active sites and enhancing the effective electrochemical surface area on the catalyst's surface.

In addition, we compared the catalysts prepared in this paper with those in the published literature, as detailed in Table 3.

#### 4. Conclusions

In summary, a h-BN-enhanced Ni-Fe-P/Fe electrocatalyst was fabricated through a straightforward one-step electroplating procedure. Among the samples tested, the Ni—Fe—P/ 0.6 g h-BN-bm catalyst delivered the most favorable OER performance, achieving an overpotential of only 200 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. Key conclusions from this study include SEM revealed that the incorporation of h-BN led to the formation of multilevel nanodefects, which in turn increased the number of active sites and improved the catalyst's OER performance. XRD and TEM analyses indicated that the catalyst possessed an amorphous structure. This amorphous nature confers flexibility to the electrocatalyst, allowing it to adapt dynamically to electrocatalytic conditions without being constrained by fixed volumes or surface limitations. This flexibility facilitates the emergence of crystalline phases with heightened catalytic activity during the electrocatalytic process. XPS data showed that the addition of h-BN increased the proportion of higher valence ions of Ni and Fe in the coating, along with an augmented Ni content, both of which are advantageous for the oxygen evolution reaction, thus enhancing the catalytic performance. Ball milling was found to reduce the particle size of h-BN, increasing its specific surface area and enhancing the interfacial interactions between h-BN and the catalyst coating, further boosting the OER performance of the catalyst.

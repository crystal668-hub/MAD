**Abstract:** High performance catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction in water electrolysis are usually based on expensive and rare elements. Here, mixed-metal borides are shown to be competitive with established electrocatalysts like noble metal oxides and other transition metal(oxide)-based catalysts. Iron incorporation into nanoscale dicobalt boride results in excellent activity and stability in alkaline solutions. (Co0.7Fe0.3)2B shows an overpotential of η = 0.33 V (1.56 V vs. RHE) at 10 mA/cm2 in 1 M KOH with a very low onset potential of ~1.5 V vs. RHE, comparable to the performance of IrO2 and RuO2. Xray photoelectron spectroscopy shows that the original catalyst is modified under reaction conditions and indicates that CoOOH and Co(OH)2 are formed as active surface species, while the Fe remains in the catalyst, contributing to an improved catalyst performance. The nanoscale borides are obtained by a one-step solution synthesis, calcined, and characterized by X-ray diffraction, energy-dispersive Xray spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. Single crystals of (Co1-xFex)2B grown under chemical transport conditions were used for an unambiguous specification of the nanostructured particles by relating the cobalt/iron ratio to the lattice parameters.

## **Introduction**

Recently, Kaner et al. described how a boride's properties can be adjusted for almost every potential application by varying the interplay between metals and boron. [1] While it is wellknown that borides are interesting refractory materials for high-temperature uses,[2–4] their activity as catalysts is far less explored. Earlier, we showed nanoscale Co2B and Ni7B3 to be very interesting catalysts for the selective hydrogenation of natural products like citral,[5] and – in an independent study – identified CoOOH as a highly active species for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER),[6] (compare also ref.[7,8]). Electrochemical oxygen evolution with a Co and B containing catalyst has been observed as early as 1980,[9,10] and recently such (semi) amorphous electrocatalysts impregnated or mixed with graphene or carbon nanotubes were described to exhibit exceptionally high catalytic efficiencies for OER.[11–13] Furthermore, electrocatalytic activities of other transition metal borides like MoB,[14] MoB2, [15] and Ni3B[16,17] are currently under investigation. The benchmark catalysts for the OER are still noble metal catalysts, namely IrO2 in acidic and RuO2 in alkaline media. [18,19] In order to replace those noble metal catalysts more and more studies are focused on 3d transition metal oxides (e.g. Mn[20– 24], Fe[24–27], Co[6,24,26–28], Ni[24,26,27,29], Cu[30]) and mixtures of such compounds. [18,19,24,27,31–38] While the mechanisms of single metal catalysts are understood quiet well, the mechanism and the synergy of bimetallic systems are less explored. Rossmeisl et al. showed that four consecutive energy steps are needed to create oxygen out of water. [39–41] The energy required for each of these steps is different, and it further varies depending on the catalyst chosen. Therefore it should be advantageous to use a material mixture of e.g. two materials, at which the first material is ideal for e.g. energy step one and two and the second material is ideal for e.g. energy step three and four. Recent studies showed that one of these beneficial mixed-metal oxide systems is a Ni-based catalyst mixed with Fe.[24,33–36,42] Small amounts of Fe incorporation improved the OER performance of the Ni-based compound dramatically. Similar studies showed that the incorporation of Fe into Co3O4 led to an improvement of the catalytic performance. [43,44] More recently Burke et al. stated that the incorporation of Fe into CoOOH enhances the intrinsic activity by a factor of 100. [7] The Fe ions were described to be the active centres, with a CoOOH matrix stabilizing the catalyst in alkaline electrolytes. While many of those presented non-noble metal catalysts described earlier in benchmark studies were unstable under OER conditions,[18,19]we present here new nanoscale cobalt and iron containing ternary borides (Co1-xFex)2B with optimized catalytic properties. In terms of electrical conductivity,[45,46][45,46] these bimetallic borides are superior to transition metal oxides, which usually possess semiconducting properties. The one-step, low-temperature synthesis of mixed metal borides is reported, as well as the characterization of the crystalline ternary boride particles. The principle of precipitation of borides in solvents using reducing agents has been described as early as 1953,[47–50] and the method has recently been extended to produce new nanoscale materials with specific structures and properties.[51–53] However, to our knowledge this is the first report on the production of crystalline (compare to ref.[54] for amorphous alloys) mixed-metal borides by bottom-up synthesis in solvents at low temperatures followed by annealing at moderate temperatures. Contrary to conventional (high-temperature) routes for boride synthesis, the low-temperature solution yields powders that are highly reactive. The determination of the exact composition of the precipitates including their surfaces is very challenging, but essential for further investigation of the role of the iron dopant in the catalyst. Thus, to prove the formation of the nanoscale ternary compounds and to determine the metalto-metal ratio unequivocally, a series of single crystals was grown with selected compositions. This allowed for an unambiguous identification of the catalysts. Surface species were identified by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).

## **Experimental section**

# **Synthesis of nanoscale (Co1-xFex)2B**

Nanoscale ternary borides were synthesized following a modified protocol based on earlier work.[48–50,53] The masses of the starting materials, cobalt(II) chloride hexahydrate (97 %, VWR Chemicals) and ammonium iron(II) sulfate hexahydrate (99 %, AnalaR NORMAPUR), were calculated for 1 g NaBH4 (> 97 %, Alfa Aeser) to obtain a molar ratio of tetrahydridoborate-totransition metal ion of four. The following steps were performed in an inert atmosphere. Sodium tetrahydridoborate was dissolved in 100 ml of degassed water and slowly added dropwise to a solution of the metal salts in 150 ml of degassed water. The reaction was stirred at room temperature for one hour. The precipitate was separated and washed with 50 ml of degassed water and 100 ml of dry acetone. After drying in vacuo the precipitate was transferred into a Schlenk tube and annealed in vacuo for two hours at 500 °C.

# **Synthesis of single crystals of (Co1-xFex)2B**

Single crystals of (Co1-xFex)2B were synthesized following a modified protocol we developed for MnB4. [55,56] For the synthesis of 500 mg mixtures of cobalt (99.8 %, Merck), iron (99.97 %, Chempur) and boron (98-99 %, HC Starck) were prepared according to the molar ratio desired for the product phase. 100 mg of iodine (99.8 %, VWR Chemicals) was added to the mixture. The reactants were sealed in a quartz ampoule in vacuo and heated to 1000 °C for three weeks.

## **Electrode assembly**

Powders of (Co1-xFex)2B (5 mg/mL) were added to a mixture of 49 % ethanol, 49 % ultra-pure distilled water and 2 % nafion (Aldrich Chemistry). The ink was then blended using an ultrasonic bath for at least 20 minutes. Glassy carbon (HTW GmbH) was used as a substrate material, sanded with abrasive paper (400, 1000, 1500, 2000, 2500 grit size, Starcke) and polished with Al2O3 paste (1 µm, 0.05 µm grit size, Buehler). Then the substrate was cleaned in an ultrasonic bath with ethanol and ultrapure distilled water for ten minutes each. An amount of 15 µL of the resulting ink was loaded onto the glassy carbon substrate with an Eppendorf pipette and dried for at least 30 minutes under ambient conditions.

## **Pre-catalyst characterization**

Nanoscale powders were annealed at 500 °C. Single crystals were ground to yield microcrystalline powders, which were filled in glass capillaries (diameter: 0.5 mm). X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected on a powder diffractometer (Stadi-P, Fa. Stoe, Darmstadt) using Mo-Kα1 radiation. The program TOPAS (version 4.2, Fa. Bruker AXS) was used for pattern analysis. Patterns were fitted using TCHZ-type pseudo-Voigt functions. Foe energydispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), the samples were measured on a carbon pad in a scanning electron microscope (JSM 6400, Fa. JEOL Ltd.) at 20 kV with an EDS detector (Apollo-x, Fa. EDAX Inc.). The SEM images were investigated in a XL30 FEG scanning electron microscope (Philips) with an acceleration voltage of 10 kV.

## **Catalyst characterization**

The catalytic performance tests with respect to OER were conducted using a GAMRY Interface 1000E potentiostat in a three-electrode setup with a Hg/HgO (1 M NaOH) reference electrode in 1 M KOH (Carl Roth) solution. The catalysts were first activated using cyclic voltammetry (CV) between 1 V and 1.5 V with a scan rate of 100 mV/s until no further shifts were observable in the voltammograms. The activity was then obtained by a further CV measurement between 1 V and 1.8 V with a scan rate of 10 mV/s. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS; 100 kHz - 1 Hz) was used to obtain the setup resistance for iR compensation. In this work all electrochemical plots are calibrated to the Reversible Hydrogen Electrode (RHE).

XPS measurements were performed with monochromatic Al-Kα radiation (XR 50, SPECS Surface Nano Analysis GmbH). A hemispherical electron analyzer (PHOIBOS 150, SPECS Surface Nano Analysis GmbH) was used, calibrated with the core lines of copper, silver and gold. Peaks were fitted using a Shirley background and a mixed Gaussian/Lorentzian peak shape. Prior to the electrochemical measurements, samples of (Co1-xFex)2B were embedded in indium foil inside a glove-box and then transferred to the UHV system in a nitrogen filled transport chamber. Only a moderate pressure was applied to embed the powder into the indium foil in order to keep the crystallites intact.

# **Results and discussion**

## **Crystal structure, morphology and composition**

Amorphous precipitates of (Co1-xFex)2B with varying cobaltiron ratios were obtained by reacting mixtures of iron and cobalt salts with sodium tetrahydridoborate in water; the powders were then dried and annealed at 500 °C. Powder X-ray diffraction (Fig. S1 and S2) experiments confirmed the formation of borides crystallizing with the tetragonal CuAl2-structure type, as expected for Co2B or Fe2B.[57–59] The samples appeared to be almost mono-phasic at low iron contents. At x ≥ 0.3, a second crystalline phase was observed and identified as α-Fe, which became the main phase for x ≥ 0.7. For x = 0.6 and 1.0, traces of an additional phase, presumably (Co/Fe)3B, were detected (Table S2 and S3). The successful incorporation of iron into Co2B was accompanied by an increase in unit cell volume, as shown in Figure 1.

**Figure 1:** Lattice parameters a (diamonds) and c (circles) and unit cell volumes (squares) plotted against x in (Co1-xFex)2B for nanoscale (black and white) and pulverized single crystals (gray). Dotted lines from literature.36

As an independent proof for the formation of ternary borides as nanoscale powders, single crystals of mixed-metal borides were synthesized at high temperatures under chemical transport conditions. Their iron-to-cobalt ratios and unit cell dimensions were determined and used as reference values in Figure 1, in addition to selected values from literature.[59] The lattice parameters of the powders and the single crystals coincide well at low iron contents. Differences at higher Fe contents are attributed to the formation of the further side phases mentioned above.

In addition, the chemical composition of the powders of (Co1-xFex)2B with x ≤ 0.3 were checked with EDS. The iron content of the precipitates proved to be identical to the iron content of the solution during synthesis (SI; Table S1). The SEM images in Figure 2 show the nano-structured morphology of the pure Co2B phase (left) and of the most active ternary boride (Co0.7Fe0.3)2B (right). While the morphology of Co2B reveals an agglomerate structure with short rods and/or small spheres emerging out of it, the morphology of the (Co0.7Fe0.3)2B shows longer rods forming a network-like structure. An additional transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image underlining the sponge-like character of the sample is shown in the SI (Figure S3). The (Co1 xFex)2B catalysts were further investigated by XPS. Here the XPS results of (Co0.7Fe0.3)2B are discussed exemplarily for the other systems. The 2p photoemission spectrum of Co is depicted in Figure 2(a). It shows signals at 778.4 eV (Co 2p3/2) and 793.5 eV (Co 2p1/2) at the same position as Co0 , as observed previously for binary cobalt borides.[60,61] A small high binding energy shoulder of Co 2p3/2 (~781.3 eV) indicates partial oxidation.[62,63]

The percentage of cobalt and iron was found to be 67.7 at% and 32.3 at% (see Fig. 3 and Fig. S4), which is in good agreement with the assumed metal-to-metal ratio in  $(Co_{0.7}Fe_{0.3})_2B$ . Furthermore, the metal-to-boron ratio was determined to be 1.95 and agreed very well with the assumed composition. The B1s spectrum shows two peaks at 188.7 eV and at 194.0 eV binding energy

(Figure 2c). The former can be attributed to the metal-boride, whereas the second is mainly due to  $B_2O_3$  and other boron-oxo-species. <sup>[64,65]</sup> In the O1s spectrum we observe a broad peak from 535 eV down to 529 eV in binding energy (Figure 2d). Prominent features are observed at 533.5 eV, 532.5 eV and 530.5 eV. These can be assigned to boron and cobalt oxo-species. <sup>[6,64–66]</sup> Additional features at 534 eV and 535 eV binding energy are due to carbon-oxygen compounds and adsorbed water, respectively.

The XPS data on Fe (SI; Figure S2), B and O (Figure 2c & d) in general exhibit the signals that can be expected for samples of  $(Co_{0.7}Fe_{0.3})_2B$  with minor contributions of oxides at the surface.

#### **Electrochemical characterisation**

The electrochemical behaviour of  $Co_2B$  and  $(Co_{1-x}Fe_x)_2B$  was investigated in 1 M KOH, using glassy carbon as the substrate material. It is well-known from literature that cobalt features an oxidation wave around 1.0-1.3 V, relating to  $Co(OH)_2+OH^- \rightarrow CoOOH+H_2O+e^-$ . Thus, the electrocatalysts were first activated by cycling between 1 V and 1.5 V, before measuring the catalytic activity. The cyclic voltammograms of  $(Co_{1-x}Fe_x)_2B$  (x = 0, 0.3) after the activation procedure are presented in Figure 4(a).

**Figure 4:** Electrochemical measurements in 1 M KOH solution showing cyclic voltammograms of (a) pure Co2B (violet) and (Co0.7Fe0.3)2B (olive) with a magnification of the redox-waves of cobalt, (b) cyclic voltammograms and (c) tafel plots of all (Co1-xFex)2B with x ≤ 0.5 in comparison to pure Co2B and (d) a galvanostatic scan at 10 mA/cm² of (Co0.7Fe0.3)2B. All CV curves were measured with a scan rate of 10 mV/s. The potential is plotted versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and is iR compensated.

The mixed cobalt-iron boride (Co0.7Fe0.3)2B proves to be one of the best catalysts free of noble metals that has been described for the OER so far.[18,19] It exhibits a significant reduction of the overpotential (η = 0.33 V; U = 1.56 V vs. RHE at 10 mA/cm²) as well as of the onset potential (~1.5 V) compared to the binary dicobalt borides, which were investigated in our experiments, too. The binary compounds showed an activity of 1.64 V (η = 0.41 V) at a current density of 10 mA/cm² and an onset potential around 1.57 V vs. RHE. Thisis in good agreement with literature data, that already described cobalt boride to be exceptionally active (1.61 V, with η = 0.38 V at a current density of 10 mA/cm²).[13,67] Phases of (Co1-xFex)2B with other values of x have also been measured (Figure 4b – CV & Figure 4c – Tafel plots). Whereas for x = 0.1 and x = 0.2 similar catalytic performances were obtained as for x = 0.3, the catalytic activities x > 0.3 were similar to Co2B. This trend in performance can also be supported by tafel slope measurements for the different phases shown in Figure 4c. (Co1-xFex)2B samples with 0.1 ≤ x ≤ 0.3 show tafel slopes of around 40 mV/dec, while those with x = 0.4 or 0.5 have values around 50 mV/dec. Even these values are considered to be an improvement compared to the tafel slope measured for binary Co2B (63 mV/dec). These values are in good agreement with results from Xiao et al., who found that Fe reduces the tafel slope of Co-based catalysts. [44] Furthermore, the onset potential is affected by the incorporation of Fe. This effect is however only valid for a certain amount of iron in the metal boride. While (Co1-xFex)2B catalysts with x = 0.1 and x = 0.2 show an onset potential around 1.51 V vs. RHE, Co2B and (Co1-xFex)2B with x > 0.3 feature an onset potential around 1.56 V vs. RHE. In addition to the activity, the stability of a catalyst is crucial for its technological application. Therefore, the long-term performance of the most active phase (Co0.7Fe0.3)2B, was investigated using a galvanostatic scan at a constant current density of 10 mA/cm² in 1 M KOH solution (Fig. 4d). The catalyst showed a strong improvement in performance with time during the first 2 h of the measurement and remained nearly constant afterwards, showing no degradation of the catalyst over the complete 16 hours of measurement time. We assume, that during the first two hours all sites in the network-like structure are activated leading to the highest overall catalytic performance. The new ternary cobalt-iron boride studied in this work shows an at least comparable activity and stability to the standard OER catalysts IrO<sub>2</sub> and RuO<sub>2</sub>.<sup>[18,19]</sup>

#### XPS surface analysis after electrochemical investigation

XPS analysis of the surface was additionally performed after the electrochemical measurements, in order to observe changes introduced by the applied processes and the composition of the catalytically active species at the surface. Figure 3b shows the Co 2p line of the (Co<sub>0.7</sub>Fe<sub>0.3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>B catalyst after the electrochemical investigation. The original Co<sub>2</sub>B peak has disappeared and is replaced by a strong feature at 779.9 eV and a clearly visible shoulder at 781.2 eV. The former being assigned to cobalt oxide, the latter to cobalt hydroxide. The peak positions and shape of the photoemission lines corresponding to Co 2p might be associated with Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, consisting of cobalt in the two oxidation states Co<sup>+II</sup> (satellite at 785.7 eV) as well as a Co+III (satellite at 789.8 eV). [28,62,68] However, this assignment can be excluded due to the presence of a strong hydroxide signal in the photoemission line of O 1s (531 eV, Figure 3(d)). But, these observations are fully consistent with the formation of a cobalt oxyhydroxide at the surface, which was observed in cobalt containing catalysts before. [6,7,11,24,69,70] They are also in agreement with the occurrence of the redox wave discussed above and shown in Figure 4a. According to the literature, the O 1s photoemission line of CoOOH shows two signals (oxide: 529.3 eV and hydroxide: 530.9 eV) with similar intensities. [6,28,71] In our case, the hydroxide species shows higher intensity. Therefore, we assume that the phase present at the surface is not pure CoOOH, but rather a mixture of CoOOH (Co<sup>+|||</sup>) and Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> (Co<sup>+||</sup>). The O 1s spectrum shows in general only very broad features. A high binding energy shoulder at 533 eV can be due to a small amount of boron oxo-species remaining in the surface region, which is also supported by the very weak B 1s signal, which is detected after the electrochemical investigation at 191.8 eV (Fig. 3c). [64-66]

**Figure 5:** Schematic picture of the cross section of the rod-like structure and its compositional changes taking place during the electrochemical testing procedure.

The here observed XPS-features agree well with XPS studies of the binary Co<sub>2</sub>B catalysts by Masa et al.<sup>[11,13]</sup> They also showed the transformation from a non-active to an activated phase after an electrochemical treatment. The XPS data measured for the Fe 3p region are presented in the SI (Figure S4). An identification of the iron species is futile since the intensities of the Fe 2p/Fe 3p signals are too low for a meaningful interpretation. The role of a small amount of iron to improve the catalytic activity in transition metal oxide compounds has been observed previously.<sup>[7,24,29,34,36,42–44,69,72]</sup> From our XPS-data before and after the electrochemical investigation, we propose that the structure of the (Co<sub>1-x</sub>Fe<sub>x</sub>)<sub>2</sub>B changes from a rod-like structure with a thin oxide layer to one with a thick oxide layer (see Figure 5). Furthermore, this surface oxide layer is formed mainly by the active catalyst phase CoOOH and Co(OH)<sub>2</sub>, whereas the central area is preferentially composed of the Co/Fe-containing boride. Such a core-shell structure has been previously suggested for such metal boride particles.<sup>[73]</sup> The metal boride in the center of the particles provides an enhanced conductivity compared to catalysts that consist of CoOOH/Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> only.<sup>[45,46]</sup> This might enhance the catalytic activity, but further

investigations will surely be necessary to achieve a better understanding of the synergy of cobalt ions at the surface and iron atoms in the core of the catalyst that forms during the electrochemical activation from the initial metal-boride system.

#### **Summary and Conclusion**

We have identified a new, highly efficient, and stable electrocatalyst for the OER in alkaline media, which is comparable to noble-metal containing compounds like  $RuO_2$  and  $IrO_2$ . The mixed-metal boride is produced by a new bottom-up synthesis technique at low temperature, followed by an annealing step at moderate temperature. By this route highly reactive metal boride powders are formed. The powders were deposited by standard techniques on glassy carbon substrates.

The OER active species is obtained from  $(Co_{1-x}Fe_x)_2B$  by electrochemical activation (cycling) in 1 M KOH and its main surface species are identified as CoOOH and  $Co(OH)_2$ . Its electrocatalytic activity is higher than that of the active phase formed from the binary compound  $Co_2B$ . Obviously, the incorporation of iron into  $Co_2B$  provides an electronic contribution that improves the OER activity significantly. XPS analysis clearly indicates the formation of a complex multinary oxide at the surface, which is obviously responsible for the favourable properties of the catalyst. The surface composition resembles that found on mixed-metal oxides/hydroxides, [27,34,36,74–77] The core of mixed-metal boride ( $M_2B$ ) contributes a better electrical conductivity to the system. [45,46,73] The specific role of each individual component of the catalyst is still unclear, but will be systematically investigated in the near future, using further borides from bottom-up syntheses with varying compositions. It is highly desirable to improve the understanding of catalytic mechanisms in order to foster the development of specifically designed electrocatalysts that are stable and consist of abundant components.

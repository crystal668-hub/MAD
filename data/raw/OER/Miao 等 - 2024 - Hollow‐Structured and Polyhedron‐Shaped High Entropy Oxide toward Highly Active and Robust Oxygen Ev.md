**High entropy metal oxides (HEO) are superior to many reactions involving multi-step elementary reactions. However, controlled synthesis of hollow-structured HEO catalysts, which offers large surface area and fast mass transfer kinetics, remains challenging and unexplored due to the complicated metal precursors. Herein, a metal organic framework-templated synthesis of hollow-structured and polyhedron-shaped HEO catalysts assembled with ultra-small nanoparticles, with up to ten metal elements, can be achieved, by taking advantage of the ion-exchange method. ZnFeNiCuCoRu-O HEO catalyst displays excellent activity and ultra-stability for oxygen evolution reaction in full pH range, with an overpotential of 170 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2, a Tafel slope of 56 mV dec<sup>−</sup>1, and a decay of activity by 7% in 30 h in alkaline medium, as well as a 12% and 8% decay in acidic and neutral medium, respectively. DFT calculation indicates that the energy barrier of the potential determining step on Ru-Fe bridge site is significantly lower than any other Ru-related bridge sites for the unique hollow structured HEO structures. This work highlights the importance of ion-exchange method in preparing highly stable and active hollow-structured HEOs catalysts toward highly efficient energy conversion and storage devices.**

# **1. Introduction**

Water splitting driven by intermittent solar and wind power is considered as an effective and environmentally friendly technology for hydrogen production.[\[1\]](#page-8-0) However, the sluggish kinetic of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) involving four elementary steps and four electrons transfer seriously limits the overall water splitting efficiency.[\[2\]](#page-8-0) Hence, the development of economical and efficient OER electrocatalyst is the key to realize effective overall water splitting.

High entropy oxides (HEOs), an emerging class of materials composed of five or more principal metallic elements,[\[3\]](#page-8-0) showcase grand promise in energy storage and electrocatalysis, due to the synergistic effect of the multi-metal components, lattice distortion effect, excellent chemical and thermal stability.[\[4\]](#page-8-0) Numerous methods have been explored to prepare HEOs with rock salt,[\[5\]](#page-8-0) perovskite,[\[6\]](#page-8-0) or spinel[\[7\]](#page-8-0) structures and achieve excellent OER performance in alkaline[\[5\]](#page-8-0) and acidic medium.[\[8\]](#page-8-0)

Hollow-structuring is a proven strategy in achieving high catalytic activity of metal oxide catalysts,[\[9\]](#page-8-0) which enables low overpotential, fast reaction rate, and excellent stability of the metal oxides toward oxygen-related reactions, due to the large active surface area and facilitated mass transfer. Many strategies have been developed to prepare hollow structures of metal and metal oxide nanomaterials, which, however, are limited to those containing only two or three metal components.[\[10\]](#page-8-0) It becomes tremendously challenging to

control the morphology and obtain hollow-structured high entropy materials due to the complicated reaction kinetics and harsh reaction condition.[\[11\]](#page-9-0) Hu and coworkers developed a rapid and continuous synthetic method toward hollow high entropy alloy (HEA) nanoparticles, by decomposing a gas-blowing agent and producing a large amount of gas to puff the droplet. The prepared hollow HEA catalyst shows record high current density per catalyst loading.[\[11\]](#page-9-0) However, the synthesis of hollow-structured HEOs has not been reported yet.

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), due to the adjustable components, porous crystal structures, and large surface area, are widely used as sacrificial template to generate hollowstructured metal oxide of two or three metal components.[\[12\]](#page-9-0) MOF-templated strategy have been reported to prepare HEOs.[\[13\]](#page-9-0) However, the polyhedron shape of MOF template was disrupted and no hollow structured HEO was obtained.[\[14\]](#page-9-0)

Herein, a MOFs-templated strategy was successfully developed to obtain hollow-structured ZnFeNiCuCoRu-O HEO catalyst, by taking advantage of the ion-exchange method. ZnFeNiCuCoRu-O HEOs show an intact hollow skeleton structure and are ≈200–250 nm in diameter. ZnFeNiCuCoRu-O

exhibits an ultra-low overpotential of 170 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2, a Tafel slope value of 56 mV dec<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> toward OER in 1.0 m KOH electrolyte, and robust stability against the harsh electrochemical OER condition. DFT calculations indicate that the reaction mechanism of OER on HEOs surface is dominated by adsorbate evolving mechanism (AEM) and Ru-Fe bridge sites are the optimal active site for OER.

# **2. Results and Discussion**

## **2.1. Structural Characterization**

The ZnFeNiCuCoRu-O HEO catalyst was obtained by incorporating multiple metal precursors into MOFs, which was then carbonized at 950 °C in H2/Ar (10% v/v) atmosphere and oxidized in the air atmosphere. The detailed preparation procedures are available in the Experimental Section. **Figure 1**a,b shows the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the ZnFeNiCuCoRu-O HEO catalyst. The obtained ZnFeNiCuCoRu-O catalyst shows a polyhedron-shape and hollow-structure, which is uniformly distributed and is about ≈200–250 nm in size. The frame of the hollow structure is assembled with metal oxide nanoparticles with diameter of 3–5 nm. The polyhedronframework remains intact after pyrolysis at 400 °C in the air atmosphere for 4 h. The high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) in Figure 1c shows that the lattice stripe of 0.316 nm for ZnFeNiCuCoRu-O corresponds to the (110) crystal plane of RuO2. The smaller (110) interplanar distance of ZnFeNiCuCoRu-O is mainly due to the smaller atomic radius of both Zn and Co than that of Ru.

Figure S1, Supporting Information shows the X-ray diffraction pattern (XRD) of ZnFeNiCuCoRu-O. The diffraction peaks at 28.0°, 35.0°, and 54.2° are attributed to the (110), (101), and (211) crystal planes of RuO2, respectively, which is consistent www.advancedsciencenews.com

with the XRD pattern of tetragonal RuO<sub>2</sub> (PDF#40-1292).<sup>[15]</sup> It is noteworthy that the XRD patterns of the ZnFeNiCuCoRu-O catalysts mainly show the diffraction peaks of RuO<sub>2</sub>. This suggests that other metal elements may take the Ru site in the newly formed HEA structure. The elemental mapping of ZnFeNiCuCoRu-O catalyst (Figure 1, Figure S2, Supporting Information) clearly indicates that Cu, Ru, Zn, Co, Fe, Ni, C, and O elements are uniformly distributed over the hollow structured frame of ZnFeNiCuCoRu-O catalyst. The atomic ratio of metal elements in ZnFeNiCuCoRu-O catalyst is determined to be Zn: Fe: Co: Ni: Cu: Ru = 16: 22: 18: 9: 16: 19 by inductive coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) (Table S1, Supporting Information).

The formation mechanism of the hollow-structured and polyhedron-shaped morphology of ZnFeNiCoRu-O, especially the role of Ru, was explored by TEM. As shown in Figure \$3, Supporting Information, ZnFeNiCuCo precursor before thermal oxidation and the counterpart after thermal anneal at 400 °C for 4 h, show a solid polyhedral structure. After loading Ru metals into ZnFeNiCuCo, the solid polyhedron of ZnFeNiCuCoRu (Figure S4, Supporting Information) was converted to a hollow structure by annealing in air atmosphere for 4 h, with Zn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Co, and Ru uniformly dispersed on the framework of the hollow structure. The addition order of Ru ions on the formation of hollow structures also matters. Following a synthesis process akin to that of the ZnFeNiCuCo/C precursor, ZnCoFeNiCu-Ru/C samples were synthesized, where Ru ions were incorporated into ZnCoFeNiCu-Ru/C with other metal ion concurrently, instead by ion exchange process. Following carbonization and thermal anneal at 400 °C for 4 h in an air atmosphere, results in only solid structure of ZnCoFeNiCu-Ru-O (Figure S5, Supporting Information). Furthermore, alternative metal ions with properties akin to Ru ions, namely Ir and Rh, were employed for ion exchange in lieu of Ru ions to prepare FeCoNiCuZnIr-O and FeCoNiCuZnRh-O, and no hollow structure is formed either (Figure S6, Supporting Information). The above results indicate that Ru ion exchange is essential for the formation of polyhedral shaped hollow structures of ZnFeNiCuCoRu-O.

The impact of lyophilization on the formation of hollow structure of polyhedron ZnCoFeNiCuRu-O Figure 1 was explored by comparing with the sample that was obtained by vacuum drying at 60 °C (ZnCoFeNiCuRu-O/VD) (Figure S7, Supporting Information) and was interpreted in terms of the surface area and pore structure. ZnCoFeNiCuRu-O/VD catalyst maintains only a limited amount of polyhedral hollow structure, and the majority present broken structures. The freeze-dried catalyst ZnCoFeNiCuRu-O exhibits a larger surface area and pore size (182  $\rm m^2~g^{-1}$  and 2.90 nm) than that of ZnCoFeNiCuRu-O/VD catalyst (130  $\rm m^2~g^{-1}$  and 1.84 nm), causing excessive mass transfer resistance during carbonization, which might be key in formation of the well-maintained polyhedral hollow structure

To demonstrate that the synthetic strategy developed in this study is universal for the synthesis of more metal elements composed polyhedral hollow structured HEO, ZnCoFeNiCuVCrMnMo/C precursor (10 HEA) was prepared by introducing additional ions of V, Cr, Mn, and Mo during the formation of the ZnCoFeNiCu/C precursor. Subsequently, Ru ion exchange and annealing at 400 °C in an air atmosphere for 4 h result in a polyhe-

dral hollow structured ZnCoFeNiCuVCrMnMoRu-O (10 HEO) in the phase of RuO<sub>2</sub> (Figures S8 and S9, Supporting Information).

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was tested to investigate the chemical states of each component in ZnFeNiCuCoRu-O catalyst, as shown in Figure 2. The high-resolution XPS of Zn 2p displays two peaks at 1044.7 and 1021.9 eV, attributed to Zn<sup>2+</sup>  $2p_{1/2}$  and  $Zn^{2+}$   $2p_{3/2}$ , respectively. The peak of Fe 2p XPS is deconvoluted into three peaks. The first two peaks at 723.7 and 711.6 eV correspond to  $Fe^{3+}$   $2p_{1/2}$  and  $Fe^{3+}$   $2p_{3/2}$ , respectively and the third peak at 718.3 eV is attributed to the satellite of Fe<sup>3+</sup>. The Co 2p XPS displays two peaks at 796.4 and 780.0 eV, corresponding to  $Co^{2+}$   $2p_{1/2}$  and  $Co^{2+}$   $2p_{3/2}$ , respectively. The XPS of Ni 2p indicates the presence of Ni2+ (873.8 eV for Ni2+  $2p_{1/2}$  and 856.5 eV for Ni<sup>2+</sup> 2p<sub>3/2</sub>). The Cu XPS displays two peaks at 952.7 and 932.7 eV, attributed to Cu<sup>2+</sup> 2p<sub>1/2</sub> and Cu<sup>2+</sup> 2p<sub>3/2</sub>, respectively. Due to the high overlap between Ru 3d and C 1s, as shown in Figure 2f, the Ru 3d XPS was deconvoluted into three peaks and these at 285.8 and 281.0 eV correspond to  $Ru^{4+}$   $3d_{3/2}$  and  $Ru^{4+}$   $3d_{5/2}$ . The XPS of Ru 3p is also acquired and shown in Figure 2g. The Ru<sup>4+</sup>  $3p_{3/2}$  and Ru <sup>4+</sup>  $3p_{5/2}$  are observed at 485.1 and 463.2 eV, respectively, and the peak located at 475.2 eV is attributed to Zn LM1. Due to the pyrolysis in air atmosphere, all the metal elements in ZnFeNiCuCoRu-O mainly exist in high oxidation state, which is conducive to high electrocatalytic activity toward alkaline OER.

Additionally, the oxygen-related species in ZnFeNiCuCoRu-O are also generally considered to be active sites for catalytic OER. The O 1s XPS is shown in Figure 2h, where the deconvoluted three peaks at 532.5, 531.0, and 529.6 eV are ascribed to surface adsorbed water ( $\rm H_2O$ ), surface adsorbed oxygen species ( $\rm O_{ad}$ ), and lattice oxygen ( $\rm O^{2-}$ ), respectively. The content of surface-adsorbed oxygen species of ZnFeNiCuCoRu-O catalyst is much higher than others, which indicates that ZnFeNiCuCoRu-O has strong adsorption capacity for oxygen-containing substances on the surface of materials. [17]

The X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) Figure 3 was performed to investigate the chemical states and local coordination structure of the elements in ZnFeNiCuCoRu-O. The X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) results Figure 3a,d indicate that the Cu and Ru elements in HEO are in oxidation state, consistent with the XPS results. The extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) of Cu K-edge and Ru K-edge EXAFS spectra are shown in Figure 3b,e and compared with that of standard RuO<sub>2</sub>, Ru foil, CuO, and Cu foil. The fitting of the Fourier transform (FT) EXAFS spectra for the Cu K-edge and Ru K-edge is displayed in Figure 3c,f, respectively. The fitting parameters for the main FT peaks from 1.0 to 3.0 Å are shown in Table S2, Supporting Information. The peak at around 1.47 Å for Cu K-edge EXAFS spectrum corresponds to the first shell of Cu—O path, with a bond length of 1.90 Å and coordination number (N) of Cu-O in HEO (5.8) Figure 3c. Likewise, the peak at about 1.47 Å for the Ru K-edge FT-EXAFS spectra is assigned to the Ru—O path in the first shell of Ru. The bond length of Ru-O and coordination number are 1.94 Å and 6.1 (Figure 3f), respectively, which is very similar to that of RuO2. [18] The coordination number of Cu—O in HEO (5.8) is in agreement with that of Ru—O, which is much higher than that in CuO (4.0) and Cu<sub>2</sub>O (2.0), indicating that Cu atoms are at the Ru sites of RuO<sub>2</sub> in ZnFeNiCuCoRu-O. The bond length of both Ru—O and Cu—O are shorter than that in pure RuO<sub>2</sub>, indicating that formation of HEO with hetero atoms

of Zn, Fe, Ni, Cu, and Co at the Ru sites results in the contraction of the lattice.

#### **2.2. Electrocatalytic OER Measurement**

The electrocatalytic OER performance of ZnFeNiCuCoRu-O catalyst in 1.0 m KOH electrolyte was investigated by linear scanning voltammetry (LSV, **Figure 4**[a\)](#page-4-0). As shown in Figure S10, Supporting Information, ZnFeNiCuCoRu-O exhibits an ultra-low overpotential of 170 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2, much better than that of ZnFeNiCuCo (410 mV), ZnFeNiCuCo-O (327 mV), ZnFeNiCuCoRu (359 mV), 10 HEO (220 mV) and RuO2 (284 mV). In order to further elucidate the kinetics of OER reaction, the Tafel slope was derived from the corresponding polarization curves. As shown in Figure [4b.](#page-4-0) ZnFeNiCuCoRu-O delivers a Tafel slope value of 56 mV dec<sup>−</sup>1, much smaller than that of ZnFeNiCuCo (105 mV dec<sup>−</sup>1), ZnFeNiCuCo-O (65 mV dec<sup>−</sup>1),

The electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) of the catalysts was measured by double-layer capacitance (*C*dl) which is derived from cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves (Figure S11, Supporting Information). As shown in Figure Table S3, Supporting Information, the ECSA of ZnFeNiCuCoRu-O is 87.88 cm2, which is almost four times that of ZnFeNiCuCoRu and RuO2. Such large ECSA of ZnFeNiCuCoRu-O is due to the formation of the hollow structure, which not only offers large electrochemical interface but also promotes mass transfer. The intrinsic activity of ZnFeNiCuCoRu-O was evaluated by normalizing current density of the LSV curves to ECSA, as shown in Figure S12a, Supporting Information. ZnFeNiCuCoRu-O exhibits a remarkable performance, requiring only an overpotential of 230 mV to achieve a normalized current density of 0.1 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> (0.1 mA cm−<sup>2</sup> (ECSA)). This value is notably lower than that of ZnFeNiCuCo (410 mV), ZnFeNiCuCo-O (370 mV), ZnFeNiCuCoRu (360 mV), and RuO2 (290 mV). These findings underscore the high intrinsic catalytic activity of ZnFeNiCuCoRu-O in the OER.[\[20\]](#page-9-0) In addition, the alkaline OER performance of the ZnFeNiCuCoRu-O catalysts outperforms most previously reported OER electrocatalysts (Figure S12b and Table S4, Supporting Information) in terms of 0.1 mA cm−<sup>2</sup> (ECSA).

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed to evaluate the charge transfer behavior at the catalyst/electrolyte interface. As shown in Figure S12c and Table S5, Supporting Information, ZnFeNiCuCoRu-O exhibits the lowest charge transfer resistance (Rct = 12.35 Ω), which is consistent with its excellent OER catalytic performance.

The Faraday efficiency of OER on ZnFeNiCuCoRu-O was obtained by calculating the ratio of the actual electron transfer number to the theoretical electron transfer number in constant current electrolysis test. As shown in Figure S13, Supporting Information, the Faraday efficiency of ZnFeNiCuCoRu-O catalyst for OER is as high as 96.54%, indicating that OER is the main reaction occurring during the electrolysis process, and the current mainly comes from the electrocatalytic OER.

In addition to the OER activity of electrocatalysis, the stability of the catalyst is also an important indicator of its OER performance. The electrochemical stability of catalyst was measured by chronoamperometry. Figure 4c shows the *i*–*t* curve of ZnFeNiCuCoRu-O. The current density of ZnFeNiCuCoRu-O decreased slightly by 7% in 30 h testing. In contrast, the current density remains 73% after 30 h for commercial RuO2. The TEM image and corresponding elemental mappings of ZnFeNiCuCoRu-O after *i*–*t* test show that the hollow structure and the polyhedron shape remain (Figures S14 and S15, Supporting Information). In contrast, the yolk-shell-structured Zn/Co codoped RuO2 can show the decay of the current density by 15% in 24 h[,18\]](#page-9-0) indicating that the hollow-structured HEO possesses great chemical stability against the harsh reaction condition of

OER, enabled by the unique HEA structure.[\[21\]](#page-9-0) Furthermore, the alkaline OER performance of ZnFeNiCuCoRu-O was compared with these HEA catalysts reported in the literature, which outperforms most of the recently reported OER electrocatalysts Figure [4d](#page-4-0) and Table S6, Supporting Information) in terms of <sup>10</sup> and Tafel slope.

ZnFeNiCuCoRu-O catalyst equally exhibits superior catalytic performance for the OER under both acidic and neutral media. In an acidic electrolyte (0.5 m H2SO4), ZnFeNiCuCoRu-O demonstrates an exceptionally low overpotential of 215 mV, surpassing the performance of commercial RuO2, which exhibits an overpotential of 278 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> (Figure [4e](#page-4-0) and Figure S16a, Supporting Information). Moreover, ZnFeNiCuCoRu-O (Figure S16b, Supporting Information) reveals a Tafel slope of 50 mV dec<sup>−</sup>1, superior to that of the commercial RuO2 (69 mV dec<sup>−</sup>1), indicating a faster electrochemical OER kinetics than the commercial RuO2. Notably, ZnFeNiCuCoRu-O catalyst exhibits outstanding stability (Figure S16c, Supporting Information). Over a 30-h period, the activity of the catalyst only decreases by 12%, whereas the commercial RuO2 experiences an 88% decrease in activity. Additionally, when compared to HEA catalysts reported in the literature for acidic OER performance, ZnFeNiCuCoRu-O outperforms most recently reported electrocatalysts in terms of <sup>10</sup> and Tafel slope (Figure S16d and Table S7, Supporting Information).

In a neutral electrolyte (1 m PBS), ZnFeNiCuCoRu-O demonstrates exceptional electrochemical OER activity and stability. At a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2, the overpotential is a mere 270 mV, significantly outperforming the 388 mV of commercial RuO2 (Figure [4f](#page-4-0) and Figure S17a, Supporting Information). Furthermore, ZnFeNiCuCoRu-O catalyst displays a Tafel slope of 76 mV dec<sup>−</sup>1, a substantial improvement compared to the 136 mV dec<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> for commercial RuO2 (Figure S17b, Supporting Information). ZnFeNiCuCoRu-O displays also excellent stability (Figure S17c, Supporting Information), as evidenced by a mere 8% attenuation in test of 20 h, whereas commercial RuO2 experiences an 81% decrease. Finally, a comparison of the neutral OER properties of the ZnFeNiCuCoRu-O catalyst with literature-reported catalysts reveals its superiority in terms of <sup>10</sup> and Tafel slope (Figure S17d and Table S8, Supporting Information), outperforming most of the recently reported OER electrocatalysts.

#### **2.3. DFT Calculations**

To explore the intrinsic active site of ZnFeNiCuCoRu-O toward OER, a slab model of ZnFeNiCuCoRu-O with (1 1 0) facet of tetragonal phase was constructed by Vienna Ab-inito Simulation Package (VASP), as shown in **Figure 5**a and Figure S18, Supporting Information. It is generally accepted that OER on metal oxide catalysts proceeds via either conventional AEM or lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM).[\[16b\]](#page-9-0) As shown in Figure 5b, the surface metal centers serve as the catalytic active site, and the OH<sup>−</sup> ions from the solution undergo four coordinated proton-electron transfer steps to generate O2 in AEM. While, according to LOM,

the O atoms in OH<sup>−</sup> ions and lattice oxygen are involved in OER, which also forms oxygen vacancies during the reaction.[\[22\]](#page-9-0) The energetics of AEM and LOM pathways on Ru-related sites of ZnFeNiCuCoRu-O were calculated to reveal the OER mechanism in alkaline electrolyte (Figure [5c,](#page-5-0) Figures S19–S22, Supporting Information). The potential determining step (PDS) via AEM, which is the O2 desorption step at Ru-Fe bridge site, overcomes an energy barrier of 0.86 V, which is lower than that of LOM (0.99 V), indicating that AEM is a more favorable pathway for OER on ZnFeNiCuCoRu-O. The high content of the adsorbed oxygen on ZnFeNiCuCoRu-O greatly improves the adsorption capacity of oxygen-containing species and facilitates the AEM pathway.

Considering the elemental complexity of HEO, the OER energetics on Ru-M (M = Fe, Co, Ni) bridge sites via AEM were explored for ZnFeNiCuCoRu-O, as shown in Figure [5d.](#page-5-0) Ru-Fe bridge site exhibits a much lower energy barrier (0.86 V) than Ru-Ni (1.07 V) and Ru-Co (1.58 V) bridge sites, demonstrating that OER is more inclined to occur at Ru-Fe bridge sites on the surface of catalyst. As the highest atomic proportion in the catalyst, Fe provides plenty of catalytic active sites for the AEM pathway of OER, which corresponds to the excellent catalytic performance of ZnFeNiCuCoRu-O HEO catalyst.

#### **2.4. Overall Water Splitting Test**

Inspired by the excellent OER performance, ZnFeNiCuCoRu-O catalyst was assembled as anode catalyst in an overall water splitting device to explore the practical application.[\[23\]](#page-9-0) As shown in **Figure 6**a, ZnFeNiCuCoRu-O || Pt/C exhibits much better catalytic performance for overall water splitting with a low applied potential of 1.445 V at 10 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> and 1.548 V at 100 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2, much superior to that of Pt/C || RuO2 (1.496 V at 10 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> and 1.611 V at 100 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2), respectively. The long-term electrolytic stability for overall water splitting is shown in Figure 6b. After continuous electrolysis for more than 50 h at 100 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2, ZnFeNiCuCoRu-O || Pt/C still maintains 90.4% of the initial current density, indicating excellent stability of ZnFeNiCuCoRu-O for overall water splitting. Furthermore, compared with HEAs and other Ru-based catalysts, the overall water splitting activity and stability of ZnFeNiCuCoRu-O are also better than that of many previously reported HEA

#### 3. Conclusion

In summary, we developed a MOF-templated strategy to prepare HEO catalysts with polyhedron shaped and hollow structure with up to 10 metal elements (ZnCoFeNiCuVCrMnMoRu-O). ZnFeNiCuCoRu-O HEOs show excellent OER catalytic activity in full pH range, with an overpotential of 170 mV and a Tafel slope of 56 mV dec<sup>-1</sup> in 1.0 м KOH aqueous electrolyte, an overpotential of 215 mV and Tafel slope of 50 mV  $dec^{-1}$  in 0.5 m H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> aqueous electrolyte and an overpotential of 270 mV and Tafel slope of 76 mV dec<sup>-1</sup> in PBS aqueous electrolyte. The current density decays by only 7% and 12% in alkaline and acidic electrolyte in 30 h test and 8% decay in neutral medium. TEM and XPS demonstrate that each of Zn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Co, and Ru elements uniformly distribute and show positive valence state in the HEOs. The high content of adsorbed oxygen on ZnFeNiCuCoRu-O surface enhances the adsorption capacity of oxygen-containing substances, promoting the AEM of OER, which is consistent with the results of theoretical calculation. Furthermore, Ru-Fe bridge site is the optimal catalytic active site relative to other Ru-related active sites toward alkaline OER.

### 4. Experimental Section

*Materials*: Zinc nitrate hexahydrate (Zn(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>·6H<sub>2</sub>O), 98%), cobalt acetylacetonate (Co(acac)<sub>2</sub>, 98%), cupric acetylacetonate (Cu(acac)<sub>2</sub>, 98%), iron 2,4-pentanedionate (Fe(acac)<sub>3</sub>, 98%), nickel acetylacetonate (Ni(acac)<sub>2</sub>, 98%), ruthenium(III) chloride hydrate (RuCl<sub>3</sub>·3H<sub>2</sub>O, 98%), commercial RuO<sub>2</sub> was supplied by Sigma Aldrich. Nafion solution (5 wt%) was from Alfa Aesar. Potassium hydroxide (KOH, 90%), cyclohexane (98.5%), 2-methylimidazole (98%), methanol (99%), and ethanol (99%) were supplied by Tianjin Damao Chemical Plant. Deionized (DI) water was supplied from a Barnstead Nano pure water system (18.3  $\rm M\Omega$  cm).

Preparation of ZnCoFeNiCu/C: Zn(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>·6H<sub>2</sub>O (2.35 g) was dissolved in methanol (100 mL) in a 250 mL beaker, denoted as solution A. Co(acac)<sub>2</sub> (56 mg), Fe(acac)<sub>3</sub> (56 mg), Ni(acac)<sub>2</sub> (41 mg), Cu(acac)<sub>2</sub> (41 mg), and 2-methylimidazole (3.25 g) were dissolved in methanol (100 mL) in a 100 mL beaker, denoted as solution B. After sonication for 30 min, solution B was transferred into a separator funnel, and dropped into solution A at a rate of 2–3 drops per second. The mixed solution was kept stirring for 24 h and denoted as solution C. The precipitated product was collected by centrifugation and washed with methanol three cycles. After drying in an oven at 60 °C, the metal precursors loaded MOF was heated at a rate of 5 °C min<sup>-1</sup> to and maintained at 950 °C for 3 h under 10% H<sub>2</sub>/Ar atmosphere. The carbonized MOF loaded with metal precursors was denoted as ZnCoFeNiCu/C.

Preparation of ZnFeNiCuCoRu-O: The obtained ZnCoFeNiCu/C was added into 50 mL distilled water, and the RuCl<sub>3</sub> (40 mg) aqueous solution was added by drops. After stirring for 12 h, the product was centrifuged and washed with ethanol two cycles, and lyophilized at -20 °C. The black product was maintained at 400 °C for 4 h under the air atmosphere with a heating rate of 10 °C min<sup>-1</sup>, to obtain the HEO catalyst ZnFeNiCuCoRu-O.

Characterization: Powder XRD was recorded on a Bruker D8 diffractometer using a Cu K $\alpha$  source ( $\lambda=0.1541$  nm) operating at 40 kV and 40 mA. The TEM of the samples was characterized by a Talos-F200x at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were collected with a Thermo Scientific K-Alpha spectrometer.

Electrochemical Oxygen Evolution Tests: 5 mg catalyst was dispersed in a mixture of 490 μL ultrapure water, 490 μL isopropanol, and 20 μL Nafion

solution by sonication for 1 h to obtain 5 mg mL<sup>-1</sup> catalyst ink. Before loading the catalyst ink, the glassy carbon (GC) electrode was washed in 0.1 м aqueous H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, HNO<sub>3</sub>, and DI water, sequentially. For each test, 12 μL catalyst ink was dropped on the precleaned GC electrode (diameter: 4 mm, area: 0.1256 cm<sup>2</sup>, the loading of the catalysts: 0.48 mg cm<sup>-2</sup>.) and dried in air by natural evaporation, followed by coating of 4 µL 5% Nafion solution on top of the catalyst film and evaporation of the solvent. Then electrochemical voltammetry was conducted on a CHI 750E electrochemical workstation (Shanghai Chenhua Instrument Corporation, China) in a conventional three-electrode cell. The prepared GC electrode was used as the working electrode, a carbon rod as the counter electrode, and a Hg/HgO electrode as the reference electrode. The alkaline electrolyte was 1 м КОН. All the potentials reported in this work were referenced to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) according to the following equation:  $E_{\text{RHE}} = E_{\text{Hg/HgO}} + 0.098 \text{ V} + 0.059 \text{ pH}$ . The electrochemical performance of the catalysts was evaluated by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) at a scan rate of 0.01 V  $\rm s^{-1}$  in  $\rm O_2$ -saturated solution, and all the polarization curves were 95% iR-corrected. EIS measurements were measured at a bias of 1.5 V vs. RHE in the frequency range from 10 kHz to 0.01 Hz. The durability tests (i–t) were performed by chronoamperometric tests at  $\eta_{10}$  (the potential to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>). To investigate the catalytic activities of the catalysts in the acidic and neutral media, 0.5 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> (pH  $\approx$  0) and 1.0 M PBS (pH  $\approx$  7) were used as the electrolytes, respectively.

The electrochemical surface area (ECSA) measurements were carried out by double layer capacitances method. The double layer capacitances ( $C_{\rm dl}$ ) were tested by measuring CVs at different sweep rates (from 5 to 25 mV s<sup>-1</sup>) in the non-Faradaic interval ( $\approx$ 0.15–0.25 V), and calculated using Equation (1).

$$j = \nu C_{\rm dl} \tag{1}$$

where j is the current density,  $\nu$  is the scanning rate. The ECSA can be calculated by the linear relationship between  $C_{dl}$  and  $C_{s}$ , using Equation (2).<sup>[24]</sup>

$$ECSA = \frac{C_{dl}}{C_{s}}$$
 (2)

where  $C_s$  represents the specific capacitance of 0.040 mF cm<sup>-2</sup> in 1 M KOH electrolyte.<sup>[25]</sup>

The Tafel slope was calculated according to Equation (3). [26]

$$\eta = \alpha + \frac{2.3 \text{RT}}{\alpha n F} \log |j| \tag{3}$$

where  $\eta$  is the overpotential, j is the current density,  $\alpha$  is the transfer coefficient, n is the number of electrons involved in the reaction, F is the Faradaic constant,  $b = \frac{2.3 \mathrm{RT}}{\alpha n F}$  is the value of Tafel slope.

The Faradaic efficiency for OER was tested at room temperature in a H-type cell with catalysts loaded on a carbon paper (1 cm<sup>2</sup>) as working electrode and a carbon rod as counter electrode. The oxygen evolution electrolysis was performed at a constant current of 20 mA m<sup>-2</sup> and oxygen was collected and measured (a constant current electrolysis was performed for 10 min prior to collection to ensure that the air was completely removed from the device). Faradaic efficiency ( $\eta$ ) was calculated by Equation (4).

$$\eta = \frac{n_{\text{experimental}}}{n_{\text{theoretical}}} \times 100\% \tag{4}$$

The theoretical number of moles ( $n_{\text{theoretical}}$ ) of oxygen produced was calculated by Equation (5).

$$n_{\text{theoretical}} = \frac{I \times t}{4 \times e \times N_{\Delta}} \tag{5}$$

where *I* (A) is the current, *t* (s) is the electrolysis time, *e* is the elementary charge (1.60 × 10<sup>-19</sup> C), and  $N_A$  is the Avogadro's constant (6.02 × 10<sup>23</sup>).

<span id="page-8-0"></span>*Overall Water Splitting Test*: The overall water splitting was performed in a two-electrode cell in 1 m KOH aqueous electrolyte. The synthesized ZnFeNiCuCoRu-O HEO catalyst was dropped onto a carbon cloth as anodic electrode, and the carbon cloth loaded with Pt/C catalyst as cathodic electrode. The anodic catalyst using RuO2 was considered the reference experiment.

*Synchrotron Radiation-Based XAS*: Cu K-edge (8979 eV) and Ru K-edge (22117) XAFS spectra were acquired using the transmission mode at the BL14W1 beamline located at the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF) in China. The storage rings at the facility were operated at an energy of 3.5 GeV and with an electron beam current of 230 mA. At the BL14W1 beamline of the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF), the Xray beam was monochromatized using a double-crystal monochromator (DCM) that was equipped with Si (111) (Cu) and Si (311) (Ru) crystals. All XAFS spectra were analyzed using the Demeter software package (University of Chicago). The XANES raw data were normalized by a procedure consisting of several steps. Initially, the photon energy was calibrated by referencing the Cu 4f peak and Ru 5f of a freshly sputtered gold wafer. This step ensured accurate energy calibration for the XAFS measurements. Subsequently, a substrate line was employed to set the pre-edge of the Cu or Ru K-edge spectrum at zero, allowing for a consistent baseline reference for further analysis. Finally, the spectra were normalized to yield an edge-jump to one. During the fitting process, the theoretical curved-wave backscattering amplitude (Fj(k)), phase-shift functions (ϕj(k)), and the mean free path (l) in angstroms (Å) for all scattering paths were calculated using the FEFF8.2 code, developed by the University of Washington. By incorporating these calculated values into the fitting models, it becomes possible to analyze and interpret the experimental XAFS spectra in terms of the local atomic structure and electronic properties of the sample.

*DFT Calculation*: All the spin-polarized DFT calculations were conducted based on the VASP.[\[27\]](#page-9-0) The electron-ion interactions were described by the projected augmented-wave potentials, while the exchangecorrelation interactions were calculated by employing the Perdew– Burke–Enzerhof (PBE) functional of generalized gradient approximation (GGA)[\[28\]](#page-9-0) with a Hubbard U extension (*U* value) of 6.2 eV, 3.32 eV, 4.88 eV and 5.3 eV for Ni, Co, Ru, and Fe. The vdW-D3 method developed by Grimme was employed to describe the van der Waals interaction.[\[29\]](#page-9-0) The plane-wave energy cutoff was set as 520 eV. The convergence threshold was set as 1.0 × 10−<sup>5</sup> eV in energy and 0.02 eV per Angstrom in force. A vacuum layer of 15 Å was adopted to avoid periodic interactions. The Brillouin zone was modeled by gamma-centered Monkhorst-Pack scheme, in which a 3 × 1 × 1 grid was adopted for all the slab models.

The change in the Gibbs free energy of each reaction was calculated as follows.

$$\Delta G = \Delta E_{\text{pot}} + \Delta E_{\text{ZPE}} - T\Delta S \tag{6}$$

in which Δ*E*pot, Δ*E*ZPE, and Δ*S* were referred to as the change in potential energy, the change in zero-point energy, and the change in entropy.

The zero-point energy was calculated by the summation of all vibrational frequencies:

$$E_{\rm ZPE} = \frac{1}{2} \sum h \nu \tag{7}$$

where the corresponds to the vibrational frequency of each normal mode.[\[30\]](#page-9-0)

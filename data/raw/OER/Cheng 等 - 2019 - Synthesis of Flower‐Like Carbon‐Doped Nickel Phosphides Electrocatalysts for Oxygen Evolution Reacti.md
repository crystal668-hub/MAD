Motivated by the challenge to find a low-cost catalyst with efficient activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), transition metal phosphides (TMPs) recently have been gained attentions as promising earth-abundant alternatives to nobel metal based electrocatalysts. Here, we present a facile strategy for the synthesis of flower-like carbon doped nickel phosphides (NiP/C) for OER catalysis, which templated by nickel phenylphosphonate through thermal treatment under H2(5%)/Ar. The phenylphosphonic acid ligand used here has excellent affinity toward metal ions and thus can act as P and C source at the molecular scale. Benefiting from the incorporation of conductive carbon and higher Ni atomic percentage provide more active sites, the sample denoted as NiP/C-850 exhibits outstanding electrocatalytic activity, with a lower overpotential of 290 mV to achieve the current density of 10 mA⋅cm <sup>2</sup> , a small Tafel slope of 74 mV⋅dec <sup>1</sup> and superior durability in 1.0 M KOH solution. This work provides insights for the rich metal organophosphonate chemistry for fabricating carbon doped metal phosphides applied to the electrochemical conversion technologies.

## **1 Introduction**

The increasing global energy demands and environment issues have promoted great efforts to explore alternative clean and sustainable energy sources, water electrolysis is an advanced energy conversion technology to produce hydrogen as a clean and sustainable chemical fuel.[1–5] However, oxygen evolution reaction (OER), a half reaction at the anode, is often considered a major bottleneck of water splitting owing to the kinetically sluggish and multistep proton-coupled electron transfer process.[6,7] Traditionally, noble metals oxides such as IrO2 and RuO2 are generally recognized as the state-of-the-art electrocatalysts for OER due to their lower overpotentials and high proton mobility efficiency.[8,9] However, their high cost, rare storage, and poor durability seriously limit their practical applications.[10,11] Therefore, it is urgent to develop inexpensive, earth-abundant and efficient electrocatalysts for OER. In recent years, earth-abundant transition metal phosphides (TMPs) have emerged as a promising class of OER electrocatalysts.[12,13,14] Many metal phosphides such as Fe-, Co-, Ni-based phosphides have been reported that exhibit relatively high electrocatalytic activities toward OER.[15–19] However, most metal phosphides are prepared use inorganic NaH2PO2 or red phosphorous as the P source under thermal treatment, which is complex, produce toxic gas and uncontrollable the phosphorization degree. Recently, some studies reported that the electrocatalytic properties of materials can be optimized by doping TMPs into carbon nanostructures.[18,20] It would undoubtedly increase the complexity of the preparation process that added conductive supports during synthesis. A more convenient method to synthesize carbon-supported metal phosphides with special morphology and properties would therefore be highly desirable.

Metal organophosphonate (MOP) materials are an important branch of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) containing metals coordinately bonded to organophosphonic acid ligands.[21,22,23] Organophosphonic acid ligands have a strong affinity to metal ions and can act as P and C source on the molecular scale at the same time, which contributed to simplify the addition of conductive support to metal phosphides. Besides, abundant of organophosphonic acid ligands are available and can easily modified with heteroelements (such as S, N). Furthermore, it's easy to prepare various monometal or multimetal organophosphonates by adjusting the metal ions and organophosphonic acid ligands, as a wide range of metals can react with variety organophosphonic acid ligands. All these indicate that the MOPs are promising precursors to prepare carbon-supported metal phosphides with specific structures and properties.

Herein, we present a practical and effective method to fabricate flower-like carbon doped nickel phosphides (NiP/C) using nickel phenylphosphonate prepared by the hydrothermal method as a precursor for efficient OER electrocatalysis (Scheme 1). The phenylphosphonic acid ligand (PPA) used here can not only as the P source but also thermally decomposed to carbon under H2(5%)/Ar atmosphere, which simplify the synthesis of carbon doped metal phosphides. When applied as the OER catalyst, the flower-like NiP/C catalyst obtained at 850°C (denoted as NiP/C-850) exhibits the best OER performance with an overpotential of 290 mV at a current density of 10 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> and showing long-term stability in 1.0 M KOH solution. The excellent OER performance can be attributed to the incorpo-

ration of amorphous carbon and higher Ni atomic percentage. Furthermore, the facile approach of synthesis of flower-like NiP/C as OER catalysts can be extended to synthesis various carbon doped metal phosphides with specific structures and properties, as a wide range of metals can react with organophosphonic acids to form MOPs.

#### 2 Results and Discussion

Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy was measured to evaluate the framework structure of the NiPh precursor (Figure S1). The strong band at 950–1100 cm<sup>-1</sup> is characteristic of P–O-Ni framework vibrations. Other characteristic bands of C–P bonds (1430 cm<sup>-1</sup>), benzene rings (1500 cm<sup>-1</sup> and 3100–3000 cm<sup>-1</sup>) and monosubstituted benzene (around 750 cm<sup>-1</sup>) also can be observed. Thus the FT-IR spectra confirms the presence of PPA in the framework by the formation of stable P–O-Ni bonds. The XRD patterns of asprepared samples are presented in Figure 1. As shown in Figure 1a, the characteristic peaks are good agreement with the standard diffraction patterns of Ni(O<sub>3</sub>PC<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)·H<sub>2</sub>O (JCPDS No. 49–2391), indicating the successful synthesis of nickel phenyl-phosphonate consistent with the FT-IR result. According to the PDF card, the position of the diffraction peaks appearing at

6.14°, 12.29°, 16.92°, 18.49° and 19.28° can be indexed to (010), (020), (110), (030) and (011) planes of Ni(O<sub>3</sub>PC<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)·H<sub>2</sub>O. The XRD patterns of NiP/C—T are presented in Figure 1b. It's clearly that NiPh precursor was converted into nickel phosphides under different carbonization temperature. It can be seen that the compounds is Ni<sub>2</sub>P for NiP/C-650, as the pattern consistent with the standard PDF card of Ni<sub>2</sub>P (JCPDS No. 03–0953). With the carbonization temperature increasing, the intensity of Ni<sub>2</sub>P increase accompanying with some new peaks, indicates the NiP/C-750 is a mixture of Ni<sub>2</sub>P and Ni<sub>12</sub>P<sub>5</sub> (JCPDS No. 22–1190) (Figure S2). Upon further increasing the temperature, Ni<sub>12</sub>P<sub>5</sub> becomes the major species for NiP/C-850.

The carbon existence was verified by Raman spectroscopy. Fig.S3 shows the Raman spectroscopy of NiP/C-850. Two typical peaks are observed at 1350 cm<sup>-1</sup>and 1580 cm<sup>-1</sup>, which correspond to D band and G band. D band related with the disordered graphitic crystallites of carbon while G band represents the ordered section. It can be seen that the intensity of D band is lower than G band. Since a smaller value of  $I_{\rm D}/I_{\rm G}$  means a higher degree of order in carbon and corresponds to a higher electrical conductivity, the NiP/C-850 catalyst is expected to has an enhanced electrical conductivity.

Figure 2 shows the SEM images of the NiPh precursor. It's clear that 3D flower like NiPh microspheres were synthesized

successfully with an average size of 10 μm (Figure 2a, 2b). In Fig.2c, a magnified SEM image shows that the synthesized flower-like microspheres are assembled by abundant nanoplates with an average thickness of 200 nm. The EDS elements mapping in Figure 2d shows that Ni, P, O and C were uniformly distributed in the NiPh precursor. These results suggest that the NiPh is a good template to synthesis NiP/C with specific structure and properties. The SEM images of NiP/C T are shown in Figure 3. Obviously, all the products basically maintained their original flower-like structure with a shrunk size about 8 μm (Fig.3a-c). This flower-like structure may provide more exposed active sites for OER eletrocatalysis.[27] In the high magnification SEM images (Fig.3d-f), it can be seen that the surface of nanoplates becomes rough and defective which is due to the decomposition of organic groups. Also it can be seen that the nanoplates became rougher as the carbonization temperature increasing, which was assumed to be the changes of nickel phosphides consist with the XRD results. As shown in Figure S4, the elemental mappings of the flower-like NiP/C-850 microsphere show it contains Ni, P and C elements. The carbon derived from the organic groups of NiPh precursor can play a bridging role in promoting electron transfer and further improve the OER performance.

The chemical compositions and elemental valence states of NiP/C-850 were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). As shown in Figure 4, the spectrum confirms the presence of Ni, P and C in the sample. The high resolution XPS spectra of Ni, P and C elements from NiP/C-850 are given in Figure 4(b-d). As shown in Figure 4b, the peaks at 853.1, 856.5, and 861.9 eV are assigned to Ni 2p3/2 binding energies, which can be ascribed to Ni in nickel phosphides, oxidized Ni species, and satellite peak, respectively.[28] The peak at 853.1 eV is higher than the zero valence Ni (852.8 eV), suggesting the Ni species in Ni12P5 have a small positive charge (Ni<sup>δ</sup><sup>+</sup>). The peaks in the region of 870 to 880 eV are assigned to Ni 2p1/2, which follow similar rules as the Ni 2p3/2 peaks. In the C1s spectrum (Figure 4c), the peak located at 284.6 eV is characteristic of carbon bounded-carbon (C C).[29] For P2p spectra (Figure 4d), the peak at 129.3 and 130.1 eV attributing to 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 of P in Ni12P5, the other peak at 134.3 eV can be assigned to the oxidized P species, likely to be correlated with oxidized phosphate formed on the surface of Ni12P5 due to the exposure of the sample to air.[30] The binding energy of P 2p3/2 is less than that of elemental P (130.2 eV), which suggests that a small negative charge (P<sup>δ</sup> ) of P species in Ni12P5. The XPS results

suggest that electron transfer occurs from Ni to P in the nickel phosphides.

The electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) reflects the amount of active sites of the electrode and can be represented by the double-layer capacitance (Cdl) and the slope of the <sup>~</sup> *J*= ( *J*<sup>a</sup> - *J*<sup>c</sup> ) against the scan rate linear curves equivalent to twice of the Cdl. [31] The cyclic voltammograms of calysts were shown in Figure S5. Figure 5a shows the linear relationship of the current density (taken at 0.05 V vs. Ag/AgCl) against the scan rate. It can be seen that the 2Cdl of the NiP/C-850, NiP/C-750, and NiP/C-650 electrodes are 3.61, 2.27 and 1.09 mF⋅cm <sup>2</sup> , respectively. The larger value of the Cdl suggested that a larger number of actives sites in NiP/C-850, which can be attributed to the higher Ni atomic percentage on the surface. The EIS data was shown in Figure 5b. The charge transfer resistance (Rct) is correlation with the diameter of partial semicircle in the highfrequency area.[32] It can be seen that the diameter of partial semicircle of the NiP/C-850 catalyst is smaller than that of NiP/ C-750 and NiP/C-650, indicating faster electron transfer kinetics of OER at NiP/C-850 electrode. The Cdl and EIS results confirm much larger amount of active sites and smaller Rct of NiP/C-850, which contributed to the excellent OER performance.[33]

The electrochemical activities of all the flower-like NiP/C catalysts were explored for OER. The overpotential at a current density of 10 mA⋅cm <sup>2</sup> and the corresponding Tafel slope are important parameters to evaluate the OER electrochemical performance. Figure 6a shows the LSV polarization curves of as-prepared samples, the oxidation peak at ∼1 .35 V (vs RHE) for NiP/C-850 corresponds to the oxidation of NiII to NiIII, consistent with previous reports of nickel oxide/hydroxidebased electrocatalysts.[34] The NiP/C-850 catalyst can deliver a current density of 10 mA⋅cm <sup>2</sup> at 1.52 V, lower than that of NiP/ C-750 at 1.54 V, NiP/C-650 at 1.55 V and IrO2 at 1.56 V. The corresponding overpotential at a current density of 10 mA⋅cm <sup>2</sup> of the NiP/C-850, NiP/C-750, NiP/C-650 and IrO2 catalysts were 290, 310, 320 and 330 mV, respectively (Figure S6). Tafel plots are established based on LSV curves. As shown in Figure 6b, Tafel slopes for NiP/C-850, NiP/C-750, NiP/C-650 and IrO2 were found to be 74, 85, 102 and 89 mV⋅dec <sup>1</sup> , respectively. The flower-like NiP/C-850 microspheres exhibited smaller values for overpotential and Tafel slope, which indicated that better kinetics and higher OER catalytic activity. The results suggest that the OER catalytic activity nickel phosphides was improved as the percentage of Ni increased with a sequence of Ni2P *<* Ni2P-Ni12P5 *<* Ni12P5. [35] The superior electrocatalytic activity of flower-like NiP/C-850 microspheres can be attributed to as follows. Firstly, the flower like structure assembled by nanoplates is expected to provide more exposed active sites for OER. Secondly, the interconnected carbon anchored the active nickel compounds, preventing aggregation and improving the electron transfer. Thirdly, Ni12P5 contains higher Ni atomic percentage on the surface which can provide a larger number of actives sites. It should be noted that the OER activity of the flower-like NiP/C-850 is comparable to those of most previously reported metal phosphides. (Table S1)

The long-term durability of the flower-like NiP/C-850 was measured by the *I-t* tests at the potential of 1.52 V versus RHE (Figure 6c). It is clear that the NiP/C-850 exhibit superior durability, with the current density decayed 4.3% during 10 hours continuous operation in alkaline solution. The stability test of the NiP/C-850 catalysts for OER was counducted with cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements. As shown in Figure 6d, the LSV curves remained almost unchanged with the overpotential slightly increased after 1000 CV cycles. The excellent catalytic activities indicate that the flower-like NiP/C-850 could be a promising OER catalyst for water splitting in the near future.

### **3 Conclusions**

In summary, we synthesized the flower-like NiP/C electrocatalysts for OER catalysis templated by nickel phenylphosphonate. The phenylphosphonic acid ligand (PPA) used here has excellent affinity toward metal ions and thus can act as P and C source at the same time under H2(5%)/Ar atmosphere, which simplify the synthesis of carbon doped metal phosphides.

Benefiting from the incorporation of carbon derived from precursor and higher Ni atomic percentage on the surface, the NiP/C-850 composites with the richest Ni12P5 obtained at 850°Cexhibits excellent OER catalysis performance. It exhibits a low overpotential of 290 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> , a small Tafel slope of 74 mV⋅dec <sup>1</sup> in 1.0 M KOH solution and long-term stability. This work offers great chances to find optimized OER catalysts for water splitting and the convenient and scalable synthesis methods templated by MOPs could be extended to synthesis various carbon doped metal phosphides with specific structure and properties.

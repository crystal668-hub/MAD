# Optimizing Stability and Efficiency in Low-Content Noble Metal-Doped Aerogel Catalysts for Oxygen Evolution Reaction

Zhuyang Chen, Ronggui Zhu, Weixuan Li, Dawei Luo, Peng Zhang,\* and Chen Xu\*

This study presents the development of an efficient Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER) electrocatalyst by doping low-content Ruthenium (Ru) into Fe, Co, (oxy)hydroxide aerogel matrix. The aerogel, synthesized using a sol-gel process and supercritical drying, ensures uniform dispersion of Ru within the porous structure, significantly regulating the catalytic performance and stability of the OER electrocatalyst. The incorporation of Ru not only enriches the active sites but also generates synergistic effects with existing active sites, further improving the overall catalytic efficiency. The optimized catalyst with low Ru content delivers outstanding performance metrics, e.g., 1%Ru-Fe<sub>4</sub>Co<sub>1</sub> catalyst demonstrates outstanding OER performance, with an onset overpotential  $(\eta_{\text{onset}})$  of 177.4 mV,  $\eta_{10}$  of 214.3 mV,  $\eta_{100}$  of 335.9 mV, a Tafel slope of 41 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>, and remarkable Mass Activity of 569.1 A/ $g_{metal}$  at 1.63 V (vs. RHE). It also exhibits good stability under operational conditions, maintaining performance at temperatures up to 60 °C and enduring high current densities up to 250 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. Density Functional Theory (DFT) simulation elucidates the optimal doping level and uniform distribution enhance the reaction kinetics, leading to superior catalytic performance. This research provides new insights into the design of cost-effective, high-performance OER electrocatalysts by modulating low-content noble metals in aerogels.

technology.[1,2] The development of a costeffective electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is essential for large-scale hydrogen production since OER often suffers from slow electron-transfer kinetics. Noble metals such as Ruthenium(Ru) and Iridium(Ir) oxides are considered as excellent catalysts for OER.[3] RuO, demonstrates the best electrode kinetic performance compared to other known catalysts.[4] Nonetheless, it is important to note that the in situ formed higher-valence Ru exhibits a significant degree of solubility in an aqueous solution, resulting in performance decay and catalytic instability.[5] IrO<sub>x</sub> has comparatively higher stability, although it should be noted that both compounds are scarce and high-cost.[6]

Previous researchers synthesized Ru-Ir oxides to enhance the stability of RuO<sub>x</sub>.<sup>[7]</sup> The performance results indicate that the hybrids have activity levels that fall between that of the pure oxides and possess a greater level of stability compared to RuO<sub>x</sub>.<sup>[8]</sup> These phenomena indicate that the extent of synergistic interaction

between the noble metals Ir and Ru in hybrid oxides may be less significant than supposed. [9] Numerous investigations have been conducted to enhance the OER catalytic stability of  $\rm IrO_x\text{-}RuO_x$  electrocatalysts or to maximize the utilization of noble metals through introducing synergistic effects. These efforts often involve the incorporation of nonprecious oxides such as  $\rm SnO_2$ , [10,11]  $\rm TiO_2$ , [12,13]  $\rm Ta_2O_5$ , [14,15] etc. into Ir or Ru-based catalysts. While most investigations show that the inclusion of extra substances enhances the catalytic performance, albeit with only a small positive impact on the stability of the active  $\rm IrO_2$  and  $\rm RuO_2$  materials against dissolution. [16]

Beyond incorporating multiple elements for synergistic catalytic effects, reducing the particle size of the catalyst to nanoscale or even the atomic level could theoretically achieve higher exposure of active sites thereby enhancing catalytic activity. [17–19] However, smaller particles may lack stability in gas evolution electrodes, as they possess a structure that is too fine to facilitate the required transport of liquid reactants to the catalytic sites and removal of gaseous products. [20] Jirkovský et al. synthesized nanocrystalline  ${\rm RuO_2}$  and  ${\rm Ru_{0.8}Co_{0.2}O_{2.x}}$  using a sol-gel process and discovered that the OER activity of pure

nanocrystalline RuO2 decreases as the particle size increases, while the OER activity of the Ru0.8Co0.2O2-x nanoparticles increases as the size of the crystallites increases.[\[21\]](#page-9-0) The authors attribute this contrary phenomenon to the presence of cobalt, which replaces some of the Ru in the surface structure while modifying the rate-determining step from a charge-transfer reaction to a delayed surface recombination of oxygen. This study illustrated the combined size and compositional effect in OER catalysis. Du et al. address the stability-activity trade-off in RuO2 catalysts for OER under alkaline conditions by constructing a RuO2/CoOx hybrid interface. The CoOx component acts as a sacrificial layer, preferentially oxidizing during OER, thus protecting RuO2 from dissolution and enhancing its stability. In parallel, the Ru/Co dual-atom sites at the interface synergistically stabilize critical oxygen intermediates, optimizing the reaction pathways and boosting catalytic activity. The RuO2/CoOx catalyst exhibits a low overpotential (1*<sup>n</sup>* = 240 mV) and a Tafel slope of 70 mV dec<sup>−</sup>1, demonstrating enhanced catalytic activity.[\[22\]](#page-9-0) This work offers a promising approach to enhancing the durability and efficiency of OER catalysts through precise structural engineering.

Building on our previous research involving high-throughput fabrication approaches combined with supercritical drying techniques, which were effectively applied to generate hundreds of binary/ternary high-performance non-noble metals, FexCoy (oxy)hydroxide-based aerogel OER catalysts with varying compositions.[\[23](#page-9-0)] A number of compositions exhibit favorable OER catalytic performance; for instance, binary Fe2Co3 (oxy)hydroxide showed overpotentials at onset,10 and 100 mA cm<sup>2</sup> are onset = 179.3, <sup>10</sup> = 214.2, and <sup>100</sup> = 348 mV, respectively. Inspired by Jirkovský and Du's work and exploiting the high-throughput fabrication approach, we fabricated amorphous aerogel OER catalysts composed of FexCo5-x (oxy)hydroxide as a support with low noble metal (Ru or Ir) content, using the sol-gel process and supercritical drying. This study showed that FexCo5-x (oxy)hydroxide displayed excellent catalytic performance, further enhanced by Ru incorporation. Nevertheless, this study seeks to exploit the unique micro/nano-structure to understand the factors contributing to the improved durability of noble metals, particularly at industrial operation temperatures above 50 °C. We conducted a thorough characterization and analysis of the samples with varying compositions both before and after undergoing OER at different temperatures. An in-depth analysis was carried out to examine the synergistic effects between metals and their impact on catalytic performance. We reveal a counterintuitive trend where excessive noble metal doping deteriorates performance due to factors like agglomeration and gelation quality degradation caused by the strong oxidative capability of noble metal chlorides as sol-gel reaction precursors. This nuanced finding, supported by both structural and electrochemical characterizations, offers valuable insights for optimizing noble metal utilization in catalysts.

# **2. Results and Discussion**

#### **2.1. Material Characterization of the Doped Aerogels**

High-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (HR-STEM) combined with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mapping visually confirms that the noble metal Ru (or Ir) is uniformly distributed in the 0.5%Ru-Fe3Co2 (oxy)hydroxide aerogel, with no evidence of clustering or aggregation (**Figure 1**[a–d;](#page-2-0) Figure S1, Supporting Information). The results reveal an interconnected porous network characterized by a substantial amount of nanoparticles with diameters smaller than 3 nm (Figure [1e,f\)](#page-2-0). The Selected Area Electron Diffraction (SAED) pattern, displaying diffuse rings, along with the absence of characteristic peaks in the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern, indicates a lack of welldefined long-range periodic lattice (Figure [1g,h\)](#page-2-0). The results indicate that the samples possess an amorphous structure interspersed with nanocrystalline particles. Furthermore, variations in composition and the type or amount of noble metals added have minimal impact on the nanomorphology of the catalysts due to the identical synthesis conditions.

The Brunauer, Emmett, and Teller (BET) analysis reveals that the specific surface area of aerogels remains unaffected by changes in the compositions, and the aerogels consistently exhibit surface areas of ≈338 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> (Figure S2, Supporting Information). The porous structure of the aerogel provides ample surface area for exposing active sites, including those containing noble metals, so that the utilization rate of the noble metals is enhanced.

Noble metals with high unit activity are effective catalysts for commercial applications, but their high cost and limited stability often draw criticism. In addition, it is crucial to ensure that the elemental composition of the aerogel catalysts aligns consistently with the intended design ratios. In this study, small amounts of noble metals, specifically Ru or Ir (denoted as *y* wt%), were incorporated into FexCo5-x (oxy)hydroxide-based aerogels (where *x* represents the atomic percentage ratios) to enhance catalytic performance. The Inductively Coupled Plasma-Optical Emission Spectrometry (ICP-OES) confirms the accurate control of noble metals (Table S1, Supporting Information). The results have demonstrated the atomic ratios of Fe and Co in both the 0.5%Ru-Fe4Co1 and 2%Ru-Fe4Co1 samples are very close to the intended 4:1 ratio, while the Ru weight content in the 2%Ru- Fe4Co1 sample is ≈3.1 times higher than in the 0.5%Ru-Fe4Co1 sample. Given the low precious metal content and the possible variability introduced during sample preparation and testing, this represents a satisfactory level of precision. These results further confirm the reliability of the preparation process in maintaining the desired elemental distributions.[\[25,26\]](#page-9-0)

Furthermore, the catalytic roles of the constituent elements were thoroughly examined using X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS). This technique was employed to analyze the oxidation states and valence conditions of key elements within a specific set of (oxy)hydroxide compounds, providing deeper insights into their electronic structures. The XPS survey spectra confirmed the presence of Co, Fe, and Ru in all samples, as illustrated in Figure S3 (Supporting Information), and allowed for the detailed investigation of their respective roles in catalysis.

#### **2.2. Electrocatalytic Activity and Stability**

The catalytic performance of the samples was evaluated using key indicators including overpotentials at different current densities: onset, 10, 100, and the Tafel Slope. Initial experiments showed that the addition of Ir did not enhance catalytic activity and, in

fact, deteriorated the activity in several different compositions (Figure S4, Supporting Information). This may be attributed to two factors: (i) the strong oxidative properties of Ir may have led to difficulties in controlling the hydrolysis reaction during the solgel process, affecting the quality of the final aerogel product, and (ii) the amount of Ir added was insufficient to effectively synergize with the original active sites and enhance catalytic activity. In subsequent experiments, Ru, which is known for its superior catalytic activity in ruthenium oxides, was introduced. Although Ru is less stable than Ir in alkaline environments, it demonstrates significantly lower overpotentials and faster reaction kinetics, leading to better catalytic performance.[\[27\]](#page-9-0)

Our experimental results showed that adding Ru enhanced the overpotential performance of certain compositions, particularly those with high Fe content (low Co) (**Figure 2**[a,b;](#page-3-0) Figure S5 and Table S2, Supporting Information). For instance, 0.5%Ru-Fe4Co1 (oxy)hydroxide sample exhibited onset, 10, and <sup>100</sup> values of 177.4, 214.3, and 335.9 mV, respectively, representing an ≈20% improvement in overpotential performance at each metric compared to the Fe4Co1 (oxy)hydroxide sample. Additionally, it displayed a Tafel slope of 41 mV dec<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> and Turnover Frequency of 0.006 s<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> at 400. Notably, while the y%Ru-FexCo5-x (oxy)hydroxide sample shows a higher Tafel slope than the benchmark commercial OER catalyst, RuO2 (35 mV dec<sup>−</sup>1), its mass activity at 1.63 V (RHE) is remarkable. The 0.5%Ru-Fe4Co1 (oxy)hydroxide sample achieves 569.1 A/gmetal, more than double the mass activity of RuO2, which is ≈280 A/gmetal at the same potential (Figure S6, Supporting Information).[\[28–30\]](#page-9-0)

Samples with high Fe content show smaller Tafel Slopes than those with lower Fe content, and the required overpotential is greatly reduced by adding very small amounts of Ru. However, adding small amounts of Ir or Ru did not significantly enhance the catalytic activity in samples with high cobalt content, suggesting that Co remains the primary active catalytic site in Co-rich compositions. Additionally, the electrocatalytic performance indicated no direct correlation with the Ru content variation, and increasing the Ru concentration to 5% in the ternary aerogels did not result in significant performance gains (Figure S7, Supporting Information), highlighting that a smaller Ru content is more cost-effective. We propose that there exists an optimal Ru content for achieving the best catalytic performance.

In commercial alkaline water electrolysis, operational conditions often surpass those typically encountered in laboratory settings, with reactions occurring at temperatures ranging from 40 to 80 °C.[\[31\]](#page-9-0) Therefore, stability is a crucial factor for assessing catalytic performance, particularly in high-temperature conditions. In this work, the y%Ru-FexCo5-x (oxy)hydroxide demonstrated optimal catalytic performance at 60 °C. However, as the temperature exceeded 80 °C, the samples progressively deteriorated. To further assess the catalytic durability. We conducted chronoamperometric tests on the aerogels, measuring overpotentials over time. These tests were carried out over 12 h at temperatures ranging from room temperature to 80 °C. The y%Ru-FexCo5-x (oxy)hydroxide catalyst exhibited long-term stability across a range of current densities, from low (10 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2) to high (50 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2), as shown in Figure [2c](#page-3-0) and Figure S8 (Supporting Information). After a 12-hour stability test at 60 °C, the catalytic performance parameters (onset, 10, and 100) decreased by *<*15%. Conversely, significant degradation was observed when the temperature was increased to 80 °C. A number of previous investigations have shown that catalytic activity increases at higher temperatures following the Arrhenius law.[\[32,33\]](#page-9-0) A more vigorous reaction will release a higher volume of gas, which poses mechanical force on the active substances and may cause the

detachment of active materials. In addition, raised temperatures during the reaction may accelerate the dissolution process of the catalysts. ICP-OES was used to assess the distribution of each element after the stability test to determine the extent of sample degradation (Figure 2d). The analysis revealed that the concentrations of Co, Fe, and Ru in the samples attached to the carbon paper (1 cm × 1 cm) uniformly decreased by 20–25% in mass after 12 h of exposure to the OER reaction with a current density of 30 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> at room temperature. It was discovered that the formation of air bubbles on the electrodes during the gas evolution resulted in a significant amount of aerogel catalyst detaching from the electrodes. Hence, we believe that substituting with a better membrane-forming material will improve the stability. Moreover, the ICP results (Table S1, Supporting Information) indicate that a portion of the sample dissolved into the electrolyte during the stability test, with the proportion of each element decreasing similarly, implying that the loss of catalytic materials are mainly resulted from the mechanical detachment, instead of the chemical dissolution of Ru.

In addition to the 12-hour chronopotentiometry test conducted at various temperatures, we performed two extended stability tests to better simulate industrial water electrolysis conditions. A 24-hour High-Current (HC) Stability Test at 250 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> and a 48-hour Long-Term (LT) Stability Test were carried out. The results, shown in Figure S9 (Supporting Information), indicate that the current density remained stable at a fixed voltage during both tests. A comparison of catalytic performance before and after testing revealed minimal degradation (*<*5%) in the LT Stability Test **[www.advancedsciencenews.com](http://www.advancedsciencenews.com) [www.small-journal.com](http://www.small-journal.com)**

While the HC Stability Test showed a bit more performance loss. Comparing both tests, the data suggest that higher current densities result in more pronounced performance decay, likely due to mechanical stress in more vigorous gas evolution or localized heating effects. Nonetheless, the catalyst exhibited significant stability in both tests, underscoring its potential for reliable use in industrial alkaline water electrolysis.

The catalytic performance of the samples is directly related to the valence states of each element involved. By monitoring the change in the valence states of the element, we can obtain an approximate estimation of the state of the active site in the reaction. High-resolution spectra of Co 2p, Fe 2p, Ru 3p, and O 1s were subjected to curve fitting for chosen samples, followed by peak analysis and demonstrated in Figure S10 and Table S3 (Supporting Information). The determination of the active sites and understanding of the activity/stability performance of the y%Ru-FexCo5-x (oxy)hydroxide samples are crucial for the development of combinatorial catalysts. Two sets of samples: y%Ru-Fe4Co1 (oxy)hydroxide and y%Ru-Fe3Co2 (oxy)hydroxide were selected for the XPS test due to their outstanding performance. The analysis was performed both before and after the stability test under different temperatures.

In this section, we briefly examine the presence of Co and Fe in each tested sample, as these elements constitute a substantial proportion of the material. The main peak of Co(II) in the 2p3/2 spectrum is located at 782.4 eV, while Co(III) appears at 780.5 eV.[\[34\]](#page-9-0) Figure [2e](#page-3-0) shows that after the addition of 0.5 wt.% Ru to Fe3Co2, the Co peak shapes become more complex, indicating a preference for Co(II). The characteristic satellite peaks of Co(II) at 786 eV are clearly observed in both Fe3Co2 and 0.5% Ru-Fe3Co2. After a 12-hour stability test, the intensity of the Co(II) peaks decreased, suggesting a significant conversion of Co(II) to Co(III). Additionally, the Co(II) peaks gradually fade as the stability test temperature increases.

Similarly, the Fe 2p spectra exhibit trends comparable to those observed in Co 2p. The main peaks for Fe(II) and Fe(III) at 2p3/2 are located at 709.6 and 711 eV, respectively, which are very close to each other.[\[34\]](#page-9-0) Figure [2f](#page-3-0) shows that the characteristic peak of Fe(III) at 719 eV is prominent in Fe3Co2. After introducing Ru, the peak shape between 715 and 720 eV becomes more complex due to the mixture of satellite Fe(III) and Fe(II). Fe(II) has a characteristic satellite peak located at 719 eV. Meanwhile, the main peak shifts slightly in favor of Fe(II). Following the stability test, the main peaks show a slight preference for Fe(III), but the overall peak shape becomes more intricate compared to Co 2p, indicating a substantial mixture of Fe(III) and Fe(II) compounds.

Meanwhile, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were utilized to examine the structural changes of the samples before and after stability tests conducted at varying temperatures (Figure [2g–j;](#page-3-0) Figure S11, Supporting Information). SEM analysis revealed no significant alterations in the microstructure before and after the reaction, demonstrating excellent durability in material morphology. The TEM results revealed several key findings: 1) The overall morphology and elemental distribution remained consistent regardless of the type and quantity of noble metals added (ranging from 0.1 to 2wt%). 2)Crystallization occurred during the prolonged hightemperature OER reactions.

### **2.3. Investigation of the Catalytic Role of Each Metal and their Synergistic Effects**

The XPS analysis provides valuable insights into the states of elements during the reaction, identifying potential major active sites, the synergistic effects between elements, and the temperature-dependent influence on these elements. However, analyzing Ru via XPS is challenging due to the low concentration of the precious metal used. The optimal catalytic performance is achieved when the Ru content is ≈1% by weight. Consequently, the Ru signals in the XPS results were weak and became almost undetectable after high-temperature durability testing, as the Ru content decreased further. Ru 3p orbitals were selected for analysis in this study because the Ru(3d) core levels overlapped with the C(1s) core level, making the spectra difficult to interpret.[\[35\]](#page-9-0) XPS results show that Ru primarily exists as Ru(III) compounds, such as Ru(OH)3 or RuCl3, and Ru(IV) compounds, like RuO2, in the multimetal (oxy)hydroxide aerogel. Before the OER, Ru(III) dominates, accounting for over 60% of the total Ru species.[\[35,36\]](#page-9-0) As the Ru content varies, the proportion of Ru(III) remains unchanged in the as-prepared aerogel matrix. During the OER process, Ru undergoes surface reconstruction, transforming Ru(III) into higher valence Ru(IV)[\[6,37\]](#page-8-0) as illustrated by the substantial rise in the proportion of Ru(IV) compounds in the XPS (**Figure 3**[a\)](#page-5-0). Previous studies have indicated that Ru(OH)x promotes the creation of \*OOH/\*OO intermediates during OER, thereby optimizing the reaction kinetics.[\[38\]](#page-9-0) This process encourages the release of the O2 molecule from the catalyst surface, accompanied by a second deprotonation process. As a result, the active Ru site becomes vacant and the reaction proceeds in a cyclic manner.

Correspondingly, through the examination of the XPS analysis of O 1S, it is evident that following a long-term OER, a significant amount of OM-OH and ODefective undergoes conversion into OM-O (Figure [3b\)](#page-5-0). This conversion suggests that noble and transition metal (oxy)hydroxides transition to compounds with higher valence states. The experimental results indicate that the intensity of this transformation increases with higher reaction temperatures (Figure S3 and Table S3, Supporting Information). According to the findings of two of our previous studies,[\[25,26\]](#page-9-0) the lengths of the bonds M1,2─O, M1,2─O─M1,2, and M1─O─M2 (M1 and M2 are Fe and Co) in FexCo5-x (oxy)hydroxide all shrink to a certain extent during the OER, and these changes are irreversible. This reduction in bond length could additionally stabilize the atomic structure of Ru on the support, thereby preventing potential dissolution during changes in oxidation state while promoting OER stability.[\[39\]](#page-9-0)

Ru is known to synergize effectively with elements like Fe and Co, enhancing the overall catalytic reaction through improved oxygen intermediate stabilization.[\[4,40,41\]](#page-8-0) Therefore, beyond considering the inherent catalytic properties of noble metals, it is crucial to examine the synergistic effects between Ru, Fe, and Co during the reaction, and their potential to enhance catalytic performance. Existing literature and our previous works suggest that cobalt (Co) has a role in promoting the adsorption and desorption of OER intermediates and acts as an effective active site in OER electrocatalysts under alkaline environment.[\[42\]](#page-9-0) The XPS study confirms that the supporting (oxy)hydroxyl aerogels contain Co in the form of Co(OH)2[Co(II)], while Co(III)

The weight percentages(wt%) of Co(II) and (inserted) Fe(II) in the various samples were processed in accordance with the XPS results.

is present as Co(OOH). In classical OER mechanism models, such as the Adsorbate Evolution Mechanism (AEM), the transformation of Co(OH)2 into Co(OOH) occurs through a reversible redox reaction: (Co(OH)2 + OH →CoOOH + H2O + e<sup>−</sup>). The following step involves the reaction of (oxy)hydroxide with OH to generate O2 and H2O, while simultaneously releasing electrons,4OH<sup>−</sup>→2H2O+O2+4e<sup>−</sup>. Thus, CoOOH is widely acknowledged as an important intermediate in Co-based catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction, whereas Co(OH)2 functions as the initial phase.

We gathered data on the Co(II) (wt.%) in each sample before and after the reaction and correlated these values with the catalytic performances of various y%Ru-Fe4Co1 and y%Ru-Fe3Co2 (oxy)hydroxide components (y = 0–2%) that underwent the OER reaction at different temperatures. As demonstrated in Figure 3c,d, components with higher Co(II) content required samaller overpotential, indicating that Co(II) serves as the primary active site in the catalytic reaction, with an increase in content resulting in improved performance. Additionally, The valence of Co increased significantlyin y%Ru-Fe3Co2 group.While the change observed in the y%Ru-Fe4Co1 group was comparatively insignificant. This difference is likely due to the relatively low Co content in y%Ru-Fe4Co1, which has an impact on the conversion rate and, consequently, the catalytic performance. The quantity of Ru in the samples also correlates with Co(II) (wt.%) with the highest Co(II) concentration observed at 0.5–1 wt.% Ru. Based on the experimental findings, it can be concluded that there is an

optimal Ru content that yields the best catalytic overpotential performance.

In addition to overpotential, the Tafel slope is a crucial parameter in electrochemistry for evaluating catalytic kinetics, which describes the sensitivity of the electrochemical reaction rate at the electrode with respect to the change of overpotential.<sup>[43]</sup> Figure 1b illustrates that samples containing a high proportion of Fe in the y%Ru-Fe<sub>x</sub>Co<sub>5-x</sub> (oxy)hydroxide exhibit Tafel closer to those expected for an ideal catalyst. This is because the kinetics of OER in alkaline conditions is determined by the third and fourth electron transfer steps ([M-O+OH $^-\rightarrow$  M-OO $^-+$  H $^++$  e $^-$ ]and[M-OO $^-\rightarrow$ M+  $O_2$  +  $e^-$ ]), and the Fe<sup>3+</sup> sites exhibit "fast" reactivity in OER kinetics due to their optimal bond energetics for the adsorption of OER intermediates. [44,45] Electrochemically generated Fe ions in high oxidation states synergize with Co ions during the OER. Fe<sup>3+/4+</sup> ions stabilize the formation of oxyl radicals, facilitating the transformation of Co(OH), to CoOOH and enhancing O2 production by promoting O-O bond coupling. [46,47] Initially, Fe ions exhibit good electrical conductivity, improving catalytic performance at low overpotential, as evidenced by a lower Tafel slope. However, excess Fe results in significant FeOOH accumulation, which negatively impacts catalytic performance by increasing the electronic resistance.<sup>[48]</sup> It has been observed that an optimal Fe content of 60-80at% strikes a balance between conductivity and catalytic efficiency, maximizing performance.

Furthermore, we conducted XPS curve fitting analysis of the Fe<sub>2p</sub> in the samples both before and after exposure to OER at various temperatures, including room temperature and 40 °C (Figure 3c inserted). In contrast to the changes in Co(II) (wt.%), the ratio between Fe(II) and Fe(III) exhibited no substantial change (only 1-2%) before and after the reaction. A recent study on the dynamic stability of Fe in hydroxides during OER, using in situ XANES measurements, explains this phenomenon.<sup>[45]</sup> Despite their high initial activity and inherent instability, Fe undergoes rapid dissolution and redeposition at the interface during OER, resulting in a dynamically stable state. As a result, the overall content of Fe(II) and Fe(III) in the electrode remains relatively constant, with minimal impact from changes in reaction temperature or Ru content.

#### 2.4. Theoretical Analysis

We conducted a density functional theory (DFT) study to get a deeper understanding of the oxygen evolution reaction activity of y%Ru-Fe, Co<sub>5,x</sub> (oxy)hydroxide. We simulated the OER reaction paths of different elements, Co, Fe, and Ru as the active sites in OER with identical support, thus issuing the corresponding Gibbs Free-Energy Diagram. Subsequently, a single Ru atom adsorbed on Fe<sub>x</sub>Co<sub>5-x</sub> (oxy)hydroxide substrate is used to simulate a low content of Ru doping, and adsorption of diatomic Ru cluster (2Ru) represents a higher Ru content. The structural models and reaction intermediate states during OER are presented in **Figure 4.** Figure 4a shows the Gibbs free energy changes ( $\Delta G$ ) for each step of the OER process: in the initial step, the adsorption of intermediates, Fe-Fe<sub>v</sub>Co<sub>5,v</sub>(OH), (black line) exhibits the lowest Gibbs free energy change (0.51 eV) compared to the other catalysts and has a higher affinity for the initial adsorption of the hydroxyl group (\*OH). In the second step, the formation of the \*O

intermediate, Ru-Fe<sub>x</sub>Co<sub>5-x</sub>(OH)<sub>z</sub> demonstrates the smallest Gibbs free energy change of 1.04 eV, suggesting that less energy is required for the reaction to proceed, enhancing the overall reaction rate. The rate-determining step (RDS) was the third step: the deprotonation of \*OOH. The Ru-Fe<sub>x</sub>Co<sub>5-x</sub>(OH)<sub>z</sub> obtained the lowest  $\Delta G$  of 1.64 eV, indicating that the isolated Ru site is more active than the 2Ru site (green line), Co site (red line), Fe site (black line) and it facilitates a smoother desorption process. Ru-Fe<sub>x</sub>Co<sub>5-x</sub>(OH)<sub>z</sub> also processes the lowest theoretical overpotential ( $\eta$ ) of 0.41 V, confirming its superior catalytic performance throughout the entire OER process.

Additionally, the Projected Density of States (PDOS) diagram was also calculated and provides a comparative analysis of the electronic structures for the  $Fe_xCo_{5-x}$  (oxy)hydroxide matrix and its modified forms with the addition of Ru (Figure 4b). After the introduction of Ru or 2Ru, the Fermi level is slightly changed and the total DOS shows a higher electronic density at the Fermi level, suggesting a better electrical conductivity, which is beneficial for the OER. On the other hand, Ru doping does not significantly influence the electronic structure of Fe and Co, indicating that Ru may improve the number of active sites on the  $Fe_xCo_{5-x}$  (oxy)hydroxide matrix or induce other synergistic effects during the process of OER.

As shown in Figure 4d, when Ru atoms are isolated, the adsorbed \*O on the Ru surface interacts with a hydroxyl group (OH) to form a hydroperoxyl species (\*OOH). However, if two Ru atoms are in close proximity, the OH molecule is attracted to the neighboring Ru atom, preventing a direct reaction with \*O on the target Ru atom. This leads to the formation of an \*O-Ru-Ru-OH intermediate, followed by the creation of \*OOH. Consequently, the energy required for the reaction increases due to the difference in free energy between the formation of \*OOH on a single Ru atom (1.64 eV) and on two Ru atoms (1.84 eV). Therefore, isolating Ru not only optimizes the utilization of \*O but also facilitates the formation of \*OOH, ultimately enhancing catalytic performance. This discovery partially explains the phenomena where the inclusion of a substantial quantity of Ru does not lead to significant improvements in catalytic activity, but instead causes a decline. It also highlights the importance of preserving an isolated and uniform dispersion of Ru on the substrate.

#### 3. Conclusion

In summary, our research has led to the development of an effective OER catalyst with an aerogel matrix supporting a small amount of Ru (<5 wt.%). The aerogel's porous structure facilitates the even dispersion of the noble metal, optimizing the catalytic activity of each site. Notably, the 0.5%Ru-Fe<sub>4</sub>Co<sub>1</sub> (oxy)hydroxide catalyst exhibits exceptional catalytic performance, with  $\eta_{\text{onset}}$ ,  $\eta_{\text{tw}}$ , and  $\eta_{\text{tw}}$  values of 177.4, 214.3, and 335.9 mV, respectively, and a Tafel slope of 41 mV  $dec^{-1}$ . Besides, the aerogel based catalysts demonstrate stability robustness: minimal performance degradation (<5%) was observed in the LT Stability Test, and a slight activity loss occurred in the HC Stability Test. Moreover, the catalyst sustains stability at 60 °C for extended periods. These results underscore the aerogel catalyst's potential to outperform commercial RuO2, significantly reducing reliance on noble metals and production costs, making it a promising alternative for industrial application.

## **4. Experimental Section**

*Materials*: Cobalt chloride hexahydrate (CoCl2·6H2O, AR), iron chloride hexahydrate (FeCl3·6H2O, 99%), Ruthenium(III) chloride trihydrate (RuCl33H2O), and Nafion solution (5 wt.% in a mixture of lower aliphatic alcohols and water) were sourced from Macklin. Potassium chloride (KCl, 99.5%) and acetone (AR) were obtained from Yonghua Chem. Propylene oxide (C3H6O, 99%) was acquired from Aladdin.

*Catalyst Synthesis*: The y%Ru-FexCo5-x(OH)z catalysts were synthesized using a sol-gel process. The specified amounts of inorganic metal chloride precursors were dissolved, and their hydrolysis rates were independently tuned using controlled amounts of propylene oxide and water to ensure homogeneous distribution. In most cases, we would FexCo5-x(OH)z sol would be prepared in the first place and then gradually add a RuCl3 ethanol (75%) solution and observe the gelling condition. After complete gelation, an exchange process with acetone was performed. The resulting amorphous metal (oxy)hydroxide powders were obtained through CO2 supercritical drying at 50 °C, with pressure between 11–13 MPa and a flow rate of 15–35 L h<sup>−</sup>1.

<span id="page-8-0"></span>*Electrochemical Characterization*: Working electrodes were prepared by dopping catalyst solution onto glassy carbon electrodes (GCE, 3 mm diameter, 0.0707 cm2, Gauss Union). The GCEs were calibrated before use. To prepare the catalyst solution, 4 mg of selected samples were dispersed in a mixture of ethanol and deionized water (1:4 by volume) and 80 μL of 5 wt.% Nafion, then treated with ultrasonic waves for 30 min to obtain a homogeneous solution. 5 μL of this solution was dropped on the GCEs and dried at room temperature. For the stability experiments, the aerogel catalyst was prepared by mixing 0.35 mg of aerogel (54% metal content) into a solution mixed with 16 mL of 95% alcohol and 0.8 mL of Nafion. A 0.1 mL aliquot of this solution was deposited onto the carbon paper and allowed to rest for one day. Resulting in a calculated metal loading of ≈1.13 mg cm<sup>−</sup>2.

Electrochemical measurements were conducted using an electrochemical workstation (EnergyLab XM, Solartron Analytical) with a Hg/HgO reference electrode (1 M KOH) and platinum foil counter electrode in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte. Polarization curves were recorded by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) at a scan rate of 5 mV s−<sup>1</sup> to minimize capacitive current. Before LSV, cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed between 1.1 and 1.6 V (vs RHE) at 100 mV s−<sup>1</sup> for 15 cycles to activate the electrodes. Potentials were converted to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale using the equation E(RHE)=(E(Hg/HgO))+0.059 pH +0.098, and recorded without iR compensation. Tafel plots were generated using staircase voltammetry (10 mV steps, 50 s intervals), averaged over all electrodes of each composition.

*Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)*: SEM and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDXS) were performed on a Zeiss Sigma VP field emission SEM with an Oxford INCA X-Act EDXS unit.

*Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM)*: High-resolution TEM (HRTEM), high-angle annular dark-field scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM), and EDXS elemental maps were acquired using a Hitachi 2700 C TEM at 200 kV. Samples were prepared by dropping catalyst powder dispersed in ethanol onto holy-carbon copper grids and dried under ambient conditions.

*X-Ray Diffraction (XRD)*: XRD tests were conducted on a Malvern PANalytical Empyrean diffractometer with Ag K1 radiation (0.5594214 Å).

*X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS)*: XPS analyses were conducted on a PHI 5000 VersaProbe III spectrometer with an Al K X-ray source. The chamber operated at or below 10−<sup>9</sup> Torr, and the instrument work function was calibrated using gold and copper samples. Charge neutralization was confirmed by monitoring the C 1s peak position. Survey scans covered a 500 μm × 500 μm area with a 200 μm X-ray beam, using a 280.0 eV analyzer pass energy and 1.0 eV step size. Data were analyzed using XPSPEAK software (version 4.1), with background subtraction methods and fitting curves selected accordingly.

*Inductively Coupled Plasma–Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS)*: The experiment was conducted using an Alient 5110 instrument. The operational parameters were set as follows: RF power was maintained at 1.2 kW, with a plasma flow rate of 12 L min−<sup>1</sup> and an auxiliary flow rate of 1.5 L min<sup>−</sup>1. The nebulizer flow was also set to 1.5 L min<sup>−</sup>1. A sample uptake delay of 15 s and an instrument stabilization delay of 15 s were observed to ensure accurate measurements. Each sample was analyzed in triplicate to ensure reproducibility and reliability of the results.

*Density Functional Theory (DFT) Calculations*: We have employed the first principles to perform all spin-polarization density functional theory (DFT) calculations within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) using the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) formulation.[\[49–51\]](#page-9-0) We have chosen the projected augmented wave (PAW) potentials to describe the ionic cores and take valence electrons into account using a plane wave basis set with a kinetic energy cutoff of 500 eV.[\[52,53\]](#page-9-0) Partial occupancies of the Kohn−Sham orbitals were allowed using the Gaussian smearing method and a width of 0.05 eV. The electronic energy was considered selfconsistent when the energy change was smaller than 10−<sup>5</sup> eV. A geometry optimization was considered convergent when the force change was smaller than 0.05 eV Å<sup>−</sup>1. The vacuum spacing in a direction perpendicular to the plane of the structure is 18 Å for the surfaces. The Brillouin zone integration is performed using 2 × 2 × 1 Monkhorst-Pack k-point sampling for a structure. Finally, the free energy was calculated using the equation:

$$G = Eads + ZPE - TS$$
 (1)

where G, Eads, ZPE, and TS are the free energy, total energy from DFT calculations, zero-point energy, and entropic contributions, respectively.

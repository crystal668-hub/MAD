The strong affinity of palladium (Pd) towards hydrogen is the main challenge for hydrogen desorption application. Therefore, in this report, we synthesized nickel, copper, and cobalt core and palladium shell nanostructure supported on nitrogen, sulfur-doped reduced graphene oxide (M@Pd/N, S-rGO, M=Ni, Cu, Co) by hydrothermal method followed by reduction of the metal nanoparticles using modified polyol method. Using X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, High resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM), Field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), the physicochemical properties of the synthesized sample was investigated. The results confirm strong interactions between M@Pd and higher surface area support that could enhance electrocatalytic activity towards hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Among the synthesized electrocatalyst, Ni@Pd/N,S-rGO exhibits higher electrocatalytic activity with small over potential 0.035 V and 0.2 V at 10 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> and a Tafel slope value of 39 mVdec <sup>1</sup> and 34 mVdec <sup>1</sup> for HER and OER, respectively. The Ni@Pd/N,SrGO electrocatalyst demonstrated excellent stability with a negligible current decrease for 12 h. The Cdl calculation shows a result of 2.2 mFμg <sup>1</sup> for Ni@Pd/N,S-rGO, 1.9 mFμg <sup>1</sup> for Cu@Pd/N,S-rGO, and 1.5 mFμg <sup>1</sup> for Co@Pd/N,S-rGO.

## **Introduction**

Increasing demand for energy consumption, the scarce resources of fossil fuels, and environmental problems divert the attention towards searching for alternative renewable energy sources.[1] The use of hydrogen as a renewable energy source has many advantages such as natural abundance source (water),[2] used both as internal combustion engine and fuel cells,[3] higher energy densities three times higher than hydrocarbon fuels,[4,5] and used in many catalytic processes as reducing agent.[2] The main categories of hydrogen production through water splitting are alkaline,[6] polymer-electrolyte membrane (PEM),[7,8] solid oxide electrolyzes (SOE).[9,10] It involves two half-reactions: - oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at anode and hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) at the cathode.

For sustainable production of hydrogen and oxygen an efficient electrocatalyst that can produce hydrogen and oxygen with low overpotential is required.[11,12] Noble metals such as Pt, Pd, etc. are the most commonly used electrocatalysts. The catalytic activity of noble metals takes place on the surface of MNP. To improve their activity, exposing the large percentage of the noble metal on a surface and making another non-noble metal in the inner part is the best strategy.[13,14] The other approach is the formation of alloy with other metals. Palladium alloy with 3d transition metals (Co, Cu, Ni, Fe) favors strong affinity for hydrogen molecules, fast kinetics, and balanced binding energy state with hydrogen atom that makes them better choices for different applications such as hydrogen oxidation, oxygen reduction and sensor applications.[15–17]

Recently, there are many reports on core-shell nanostructure in which the transition metals like Ni, Co, Cu are placed in core and the noble metal on the shell.[18,19] The strategy of alloying such an element having a smaller lattice constant than Pd can modify the catalytic activity of Pd by the reduction of Pd Pd bond distance, which in turns result in the weakening of the bond. Moreover, these elements are multifunctional catalyst so they can improve the catalytic activity by the synergetic effect. The cumulative effect will bring a change in the binding energy leading to an enhanced rate of reaction, selectivity, and stability of the electrocatalyst.[20]

Besides this, the use of suitable support materials like graphene is another practical approach to develop highly active electrocatalyst. [21–23]

Graphene-based support is preferred because of its high electrical conductivity, higher density, flexibility, and stability. Beteroatom doping of graphene oxide may change the electronic structure by weakening the bond with oxygen resulting in improved electronic transfer and conductivity. The electron reach species like nitrogen and sulfur doping on graphene oxide may change the  $\pi$ -conjugate system and carbon structure that favor the formation of more defects and an additional site for anchoring the metal nanoparticles. Furthermore, they help in enhancing the interaction between the metal nanoparticle and the support while promoting the transfer of an electron from the support to the metal nanoparticle.  $^{[36]}$ 

The main characteristic of a promising electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is having moderate binding energy for hydrogen that depends on the property of active material (metal), composite and surface strain, and alloying in the metal particle. Pd based electrocatalyst has higher binding energy for hydrogen and low hydrogen evolution activity (30–50 times) lower than that of Pt, and they are mostly used in methanol oxidation reaction, degradation of formic acid, and oxygen reduction reaction. Because of the strong affinity for hydrogen, the use of Pd electrocatalyst an alternative to Pt is challenging. To affect the binding energy of Pd towards hydrogen, formation of nanostructure with other metals to form alloys or core-shell structure are the possible options.

To synthesize nanostructure with different shapes and composition, capping agents (stabilizers) plays a vital role. They can bind with the  $M_{\text{NP}}$  and prevent aggregation. Hexadecyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) is a common inexpensive stabilizer and commonly used for the synthesis of nanostructure.  $^{[41-44]}$ 

In this report, we developed Ni, Co, Cu core, and Pd<sub>shell</sub> supported on N, S-doped reduced graphene oxide by hydrothermal method followed by chemical reduction. The evaluation of their electrocatalytic activities towards the Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) was also investigated. The synergetic interaction between M@Pd and N, S-rGO could result in an excellent charge transfer and higher catalytic activity. This strategy is not only helpful to decrease the palladium loading, but it also contributes to the better interaction between the M<sub>core</sub> and palladium shells that could affect the d-band energy. M@Pd also improves the catalytic activity of the nanocomposite. [45,46] Moreover, the use of N, S-rGO as support may not only act as support, but it can also contribute to the active catalytic center.

For the first time, to the best of our knowledge, we synthesized M@Pd(M=Ni, Co, Cu) supported on N, S-rGO by modified polyol protocol, using hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide(CTAB) as a stabilizer. Efforts were also made to evaluate their electrocatalytic activity towards hydrogen evolution (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The synthe-

sized electrocatalyst demonstrates higher electrocatalytic activity, stability, and reasonable charge transfer resistance.

#### Result and discussion

#### Physicochemical characterization

The XRD pattern of the synthesized electrocatalyst displayed in Figure 1 (a) the diffraction peak at  $2\theta = 25.8^{\circ}$  and 43.2 correspond to (002) and (101) plane of N, S-rGO (JCPDS Card No.2-456), and the diffraction peaks around  $2\theta = 40^{\circ}(d_{hkl} =$ 0.231 nm),  $46.6^{\circ}$  ( $d_{hkl} = 0.191$  nm), and  $67.5^{\circ}$ ( $d_{hkl} = 0.148$  nm), in the three electrocatalysts correspond to (111), (200) and (220) planes of palladium respectively (PDF# 46-1043 and # 89-4897). Comparing the XRD peaks of Pd nanoparticle in the three composites, the Ni@Pd/N, S-rGO nanocomposite shows a shift in  $2\theta$  to higher value due to the decrease in the lattice spacing. The XRD profile of M@Pd/N, S-rGO (M=Ni, Cu, Co) composite clearly shows the presence of XRD peak of both Pd and M (Ni, Cu, Co) that indicate the co-existence of M@Pd and absence of alloy formation which confirms the formation of nanocomposite by core-shell, not by alloying. The extent of Ni oxidation is typical in many reactions involving Ni metal/salt, but the XRD analysis shows only Ni metal peak, which indicates the absence of NiO formation, which further supported by the XPS result.

The Raman spectroscopy is a useful technique to analyze the defect in the nanostructure in a non-destructive way. The Raman spectrum of N, S-rGO, Ni@Pd/N, S-rGO, Cu@Pd/N, S-rGO, Co@Pd/N, S-rGO is displayed in Figure 1(b) and summarized in Table 1. Graphene oxide has two characteristics band at 1337 cm $^{-1}$ , which corresponds to D-band due to disorder in graphitic structure, and the G-band at 1592 cm $^{-1}$  corresponds to the scattering of E<sub>2</sub>g mode. [47] Compared to pure graphene oxide, the observed shift in the Raman spectrum of N, S-rGO to higher wavenumber 1340 cm $^{-1}$  and 1600 cm $^{-1}$  for D and G band respectively could be due to incorporation of heteroatoms (N and S doping).

Furthermore, the introduction of Ni@Pd (M=Ni, Cu, Co) resulted in the change of the peak position and intensity due to change in the lattice parameter that confirms strong interaction between Ni@Pd and N, S-rGO. Relatively the higher ratio of  $I_D/I_G$  indicates the formation of the more structural defect and chemical modification of graphitic carbon, which further confirms the successful doping of N and S on graphene oxide. The  $I_D/I_G$  ratio increases as Ni/Co/Cu is added to the nanostructure material indicating the formation of more defects. The high value in Ni could be due to the high electron density of Ni compared to Co and Cu. This allows Ni to form a

stronger bond with palladium resulting in improved electrocatalytic activity.

The XPS analysis is used to confirm the elemental composition, electronic structure, and chemical state of the elements on the surface. The XPS result of the best performing electrocatalyst Ni@Pd/N, S-rGO displayed in Figure 2 shows the presence of the following elements Pd3d, Ni 2p, C1s, N1s, S 1s, and O 1s. The observed doublet peaks in Figure 2(a) at the binding energies of Pd 3d3/2 (335.2 eV) and Pd 3d5/2 (340.2 eV) can be associate with metallic palladium Pd (0), and the peak observed at relatively higher binding energies 337.1 eV and 342.4 eV related to Pd(II).[48–51] The higher intensity of Pd<sup>0</sup> indicates Pd nanoparticle mostly exist as Pd0 in the sample. The XPS spectrum of Ni 2p peaks in Figure 2 (c) at 856.5 eV and 875.3 eV corresponds to Ni2 p3/2, and Ni2 p1/2 which shifted to higher binding energies that could indicate the transfer of an electron from Ni to Pd resulted in the shift in the binding energies, and there are some satellite peaks around Ni2 p3/2 and Ni2 p1/2 as expected. In Figure 2 (b), the C1s shows the main spectra peak at 284.6 eV corresponds to graphitic carbon due to distortion of Sp3 hybridization or formation of (C C) Sp2. The smaller intensity peak at 286 eV related to C N or C S corresponds to the epoxy/hydroxyl group, and another smallest intensity peak at 288.9 eV corresponds to the oxygen-containing group (O C=O).[52] The XPS spectra of sulfur displayed in Figure 2 (f) the peak at 161.2 eV and 163 eV belongs to S 2p3/2 and S 2p5/2 associated with metallic sulfide. In Figure 2 (d) the N 1s spectra shows prominent peak at 398.5 eV associated with pyridic-N with Sp2- hybridization(C C=N-C).[53,54] The XPS analysis result confirms the successful doping of N and S on the graphene nanosheet and strong interaction in the electronic structure of Ni and Pd supported by N, S-rGO.

The structure of the synthesized sample characterized by FE-SEM (Figure S3 supporting information) and the HR-TEM shown in Figure 3 reveals a nanoflake morphology with a certain extent of agglomeration of particles. The HR-TEM image of the best performing catalyst in Figure 3 shows the Ni@Pd nanoparticles uniformly dispersed on N,S-rGO. Moreover, the image reveals that fringes with a calculated lattice spacing of 0.231 nm and 0.203 nm are associated with Pd (111) and Ni (111) in the core shell nanostructure. The elemental analysis EDS also proves the presence of Ni, Pd, C, S, N, and O elements.

#### **Electrochemical performance for hydrogen evolution (HER)**

The electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity of the prepared catalyst evaluated by using linear sweep voltammetry. The onset potential of Ni@Pd/N,S-rGO is 22 mV, Cu@Pd/N,S-rGO 42 mV, Co@Pd/N,S-rGO 58 mV and Pd/N,S-rGO 64 mV (vs RHE), displayed in Figure 4. The overpotential is one of the main

characteristics needed to stimulate the hydrogen evolution on the electrochemical surface at a particular current density. The overpotential required to reach the benchmark current density 10 mAcm<sup>2</sup> are 35 mV, 48 mV, 56 mV, and 70 mV (vs. RHE) for Ni@Pd/N, S-rGO, Cu@Pd/N,S-rGO, Co@Pd/N,S-rGO and Pd/N,SrGO respectively. The Tafel slope value derived from the polarization curve is used to determine the possible kinetics and mechanism of HER. '

**Tafel equation, over potential**= **b logj**+**a** (Where j is the current density and b is the Tafel slope)

The Tafel slope value derived from polarization carve for Ni@Pd/N, S-rGO is 39 mVdec <sup>1</sup> which is lowest compared to Cu@Pd/N, S-rGO (51 mVdec <sup>1</sup> ), Co@Pd/N, S-rGO (58 mVdec <sup>1</sup> ) and Pd/N, S-rGO (70 mVdec <sup>1</sup> ). This shows the HER activity for Cu@Pd/N, S-rGO, and Co@Pd/N, S-rGO follows the Volmer-Heyrousky mechanism, and the rate-determining step is the hydrogen desorption from the surface of the catalyst.[55–57] In contrast, Ni@Pd/N, S-rGO follows the Volmer-Tafel mechanism in which the adsorption of hydrogen to the electrocatalyst surface is the rate-determining step.

The catalyst stability is another essential characteristic of electrocatalysts for HER. The stability of the prepared electrocatalyst was evaluated by repeating cycling at 100 mVs <sup>1</sup> after 10,000 cycles (potential scan). No changes were observed in the polarization curve of Ni@Pd/N, S-rGO, and the chronoamperometry study also shows no significant change for 12 h, which indicates the high durability of the electrocatalyst.

The electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) is correlated with the double-layer capacitance (Cdl) of the electrocatalyst[58] that is measured in the non-faradic region at different scan rate 20 mVs 1 , 40 mVs 1 , 60 mVs 1 , 80 mVs 1 , 100 mVs 1 , and the double-layer capacitance (Cdl) was estimated by plotting D**J**ð**ja jc**Þ **vs scan rate**.

The Cdl calculated from cyclic voltammetry shows that Ni@Pd/N, S-rGO 2.2 mFμg <sup>1</sup> , Cu@Pd/N, S-rGO 1.9 mFμg <sup>1</sup> and Co@Pd/N, S-rGO 1.5 mFμg <sup>1</sup> as displayed in Figure 5 (a, b, c). Ni@Pd/N, S-rGO demonstrated higher ECSA, which indicated alloying Pdshell with Nicore supported on N, S-rGO provide more active sites for electrocatalytic HER activity. The electrochemical performance of the synthesized electrocatalyst for HER in comparison to other reported electrocatalyst in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution is presented in Table 2.

#### **Electrocatalytic activity of oxygen evolution reaction (OER)**

It is challenging to get an efficient catalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) because it is a very complex reaction and requires greater energy in which O H bond breaking and O=O bond formation and also involves four-electron transfer processes. So that for OER activity measurement, 0.1 M KOH solution was used and displayed in Figure 6. The overpotential required to reach a benchmark current density 10 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> Ni@Pd/N, S-rGO require 0.2 V which is then compared to

XRD, Raman spectroscopy, XPS, HR-TEM, and FE-SEM result verify the purity of the synthesized electrocatalyst that demonstrate the effectiveness of the synthesis method. The electrocatalytic activity, stability, and charge transfer properties of the synthesized electrocatalyst were evaluated and compared towards HER and OER. Ni@Pd/N, S-rGO demonstrate the higher electrocatalytic activity with lower onset potential (22 mV vs. RHE), overpotential (35 mV vs. RHE) at 10 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> and Tafel slope value (39 mVdec <sup>1</sup> ) compared to Cu@Pd/N, SrGO, Co@Pd/N, S-rGO, Pd/N, S-rGO that resulted from strong Pd and Ni interactions form XRD, Raman spectroscopy and XPS result. Thus, M@Pd (M=Ni, Cu, Co) supported on N, S-rGO could be promising electrocatalysts for HER and OER, particularly Ni@Pd/N, S-rGO could be best promising electrocatalyst for HER and OER because of higher activity and stability which comparable to the known catalyst Pt/C. Thus, the present work produces an electrocatalyst with less palladium loading with enhanced electrocatalytic performance compared to Pd/C and Pd/N, S-rGO.

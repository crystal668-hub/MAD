**The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a pivotal process in numerous renewable energy conversion technologies. However, its sluggish intrinsic kinetics and intricate transfer process impede the efficient conversion of energy. Activating the lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM) is of paramount importance to break through the theoretical scaling relationship and boost the oxygen evolution catalytic activity. In this contribution, N and F are successfully introduced into Co3O4 simultaneously as heteroatoms via a controllable plasma strategy to modulate the covalency property of metal-oxygen. Theoretical simulations and experiment results demonstrated that the covalency of the cobalt-oxygen bond is significantly enhanced under the synergistic effect of N and F, successfully triggering the LOM pathway and facilitating the OER process. The N, F-Co3O4 composite displays an impressive OER performance, exhibiting a low overpotential of 254 mV at 10 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> and remarkable stability at 20, 150, and 400 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2. In addition, The N, F-Co3O4 also exhibits a low overpotential of 285 mV at 20 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> in 1 m KOH + 0.5 m NaCl solution, and remarkable performance on overall water splitting. This work offers profound insights into the OER mechanism and a crucial strategy for enhancing the electrocatalytic activity of spinel oxides.**

## **1. Introduction**

Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a significant semi-reaction that has been employed in a variety of critical energy conversion and storage applications, including water electrolysis and various rechargeable metal-air batteries, etc., to cope with the worldwide energy crisis and environmental pollution.[\[1\]](#page-9-0) However, due to its sluggish kinetics, a high overpotential is required to complete the four electronproton-transfer process, which significantly limits the overall efficiency of these energy conversion and storage devices. Although noble metal (Ir, Ru)-based materials can accelerate the sluggish process, the scarcity and exorbitant cost of noble metals severely hinder their broader industrial applications.[\[2\]](#page-9-0) Thus, it is highly imperative to develop affordable alternatives for the anticipated renewable energy applications.

Up to now, earth-abundant transition metal-based oxides have been developed

as promising candidates for OER. Among them, Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> as a prominent spinel oxide (AB2O4) has attracted tremendous attention as the most promising electrocatalyst owing to its efficient activity and electrochemical stability.[3,4] Nonetheless, Co<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-based OER electrocatalysts commonly follow the adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM), which is widely accepted as the conventional OER pathway.<sup>[5]</sup> Multiple intermediates are involved in this pathway and limited by the scaling relationship ( $\Delta G_{(*OOH)} = \Delta G_{(*OH)}$ + 3.2 eV). This results in a substantial theoretical overpotential limitation of 370 mV, which consequently leads to an intrinsic inferior catalytic activity.<sup>[4,6]</sup> Consequently, circumventing the scaling relationship emerges as a pivotal strategy to enhance the catalytic activity of non-precious candidates. Recently, Shao-Horn's group discovered that regulating the covalence of M-O can trigger the direct O-O formation by the coupling between the \*O intermediate and lattice oxygen, which enables the breakthrough in the scaling relationship of AEM. This novel pathway is referred to as the lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM) and offers a novel paradigm for the development of high-performance OER electrocatalysts.[7,8]

The introduction of foreign atoms has been shown to be one of the most effective approaches to regulating the M-O covalence toward lattice oxygen activation. For example, single-atom Zn doping induces a transition in the OER mechanism of NiOOH from AEM to LOM by strengthening the covalence of Ni-O.[9] However, the introduction of a single type of transition metal atoms is limited in its ability to regulate the covalence of M-O, such as NiCo2O4 and ZnCo2O4. Fu et al. found that 4d transition metal as a second foreign atom introduced simultaneously can trigger the lattice oxygen to participate in the OER process. The Zn/Ru co-doped Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, synthesized via a tannic acid etching strategy combined with cation exchange followed by air calcination, and the Mn/Ru co-doped Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, fabricated using a threeelectrode electrodeposition system with carbon cloth as the working electrode, have been have been reported as efficient and robust OER electrocatalysts.<sup>[10]</sup> In these candidates, the catalytically inactive transition metals (Zn, Mn) act as structure stabilizers, and the Ru is an active site to trigger the lattice oxygen to participate in the OER process. However, in this strategy, it is still inevitable to involve the use of noble metals. Therefore, nonmetallic elements with high electronegativity, such as nitrogen (N), fluorine (F), phosphorus (P), and sulfur (S) have also been introduced to enhance the hybridization of M-d and O-p orbitals to strengthen the covalence of M-O and trigger the mechanism of OER from AEM to LOM. [11,12] Although this literature demonstrated the regulation of the OER mechanism, the introduction of a single kind of foreign atom is limited in its ability to regulate the covalence of M—O. Furthermore, since the oxygen atoms coordinated with the foreign atom are identical to participate in the OER process simultaneously via the LOM pathway, the binding structure around it will disintegrate rapidly, resulting in the leaching and dissolution of metal cations and subsequent deactivation of the catalytic centers. To the best of our knowledge, double anions doped metal oxides as the OER electrocatalyst have rarely been explored since it is difficult to simultaneously introduce bis-nonmetallic elements into metal oxides.

In this study, we proposed a novel  $NH_4F$  plasma strategy to simultaneously introduce N and F into  $Co_3O_4$  at room temperature. The theoretical density calculations, Raman, X-ray pho-

toelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) results revealed that the covalence of N and F doped Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (N, F-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>) is stronger than that of N- or F-doped Co<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>. Chemical probe analysis, pH-dependent OER, tetramethylammonium cation (TMA+) adsorption, and online electrochemical mass spectrometry measurements of <sup>18</sup>O-labeled catalysts, suggested that the OER mechanism switches from AEM to LOM. The obtained N, F-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> exhibited a low overpotential of 254 mV at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> and excellent stability at 20, 150, and 400 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> in 1 м KOH. In addition, a low overpotential of 285 mV at 20 mA  $cm^{-2}$  and excellent stability at 150 mA  $cm^{-2}$  in 1 м KOH+0.5 м NaCl solution and the excellent functionality of the two-electrode overall water splitting device collectively demonstrate the applicability of N, F-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> for water electrolysis across diverse scenarios. This work proposes a novel methodology for the fabrication of highly active and stable spinel oxides OER electrocatalysts following the LOM pathway.

#### 2. Results and Discussion

First, Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were conducted to investigate the Co-O covalence of Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> after doping with N and F. The value of the crystal orbital Hamilton populations (COHP) was simulated to evaluate the Co—O bond strength. The values of Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> doped with the different non-metallic elements increase with the trend as N, F-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (0.59) > N-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>  $(0.48) > F-Co_3O_4$   $(0.47) > Co_3O_4$  (0.27) (Figure 1a). It was suggested that the introduction of N and F can positively regulate the strength of the Co-O band. Moreover, the partial density of state (PDOS) and d/p band centers were examined to elucidate the covalence of Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> doped N and F. The d-band center of Co 3d is shifted from -1.12 eV of  $Co_3O_4$  to -1.08 eV of N, F- $Co_3O_4$ (Figure 1b) This behavior results in a more electron-rich character of Co for reduction ability, facilitating rapid electron transfer between Co and adsorbents, which is beneficial for the OER process.[12,13] Additionally, the introduction of the N and F anions allows for the activation of lattice oxygen by shifting the O 2p band closer to the Fermi level (Figure 1c). In the meanwhile, the energy gap ( $\Delta U$ ) between the Co 3d and O 2p-band centers ( $E_{Co-3d}$  and  $E_{O-2n}$ ) is observed to decrease with doping N and F simultaneously (Figures 1d,e; Table S1, Supporting Information), and the N and F co-doped  $Co_3O_4$  exhibits the lowest  $\Delta U$  value (2.64 eV), indicating enhancing the hybridization between Co 3d and O 2p and a heightened covalence of Co-O bonds in N, F-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>.[8,14] Overall, the incorporation of N and F can continuously optimize the Co–O covalence of Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, which can activate the LOM in the OER process according to the results of DFT.

To verify the above theoretical hypothesis, the N, F-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> was synthesized with plasma assistance (**Figure 2a**). Initially, dense and uniform Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> nanowire arrays are grown on Ni foam (NF) by a simple hydrothermal method as previously reported<sup>[15]</sup> (Figure S1a, Supporting Information). The nanowire consists of Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> nanoparticles with a lattice spacing of 0.244 and 0.468 nm (Figure S1b, Supporting Information). NH<sub>4</sub>F acts as the precursor to produce N and F plasma atmosphere. During the plasma treatment process, N radical and F radical signals were observed via the optical emission spectrometer (Figure S2, Supporting Information). The X-ray diffraction patterns (XRD) results for samples indicated that the distinct peaks located at 19.1°, 31.3°,

and 36.9° were well indexed to the lattice planes (111), (220), and (311) of Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>. Obviously, the peaks of N, F-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> shifted to a lower angle relative to Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (0.3°, 2-theta) due to the doping of N and F (Figure 2b). The morphology of the array was very well preserved, except that the surface became rough (Figure 2c). As demonstrated in Figure 2d and Figure S3 (Supporting Information), the edge of the Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> nanoparticles after NH₄F plasma treatment is indistinct in the TEM images. Compared with Figure S1b (Supporting Information), the N, F-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> exhibit a significantly higher proportion of amorphous regions, which can be attributed to the enhanced covalency resulting from N and F doping. In addition, Energy Dispersive Xray Spectroscopy (EDS) mapping images clearly show the uniform distribution of main elements including Co, O, N, and F within N, F-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (Figure 2e), indicating the successful introduction of N and F by NH<sub>4</sub>F plasma. Consistent with the results of NH<sub>4</sub>F plasma treatment, both morphology and phase do not change after N2 or CF4 plasma treatment (Figures S4 and S5, Supporting Information). And the XPS results revealed that N and F can be successfully introduced into Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> to obtain the N-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> and F-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, respectively (Figure S6a,b, Supporting Information).

The lattice dynamics of  $\text{Co}_3\text{O}_4$  after heteroatom doping were evaluated by Raman spectroscopy (**Figure 3a**). The characteristic peaks within the range of 150 to 750 cm<sup>-1</sup> are typical active modes  $\text{Co}_3\text{O}_4$ . [<sup>16]</sup> The red shift of the N, F-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> Raman bands (A<sub>1g</sub>, F<sup>2</sup><sub>2g</sub>, E<sub>g</sub>, and F<sub>2g</sub>) in comparison to the Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> suggests the shrinkage

in Co-O bonding length, which can be attributed to the enhancement of covalence resulting from the co-doping of N and F.[17] In addition, there is no obvious shift of the Raman bands in N-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> and F-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> compared to the Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> To gain further insight into the electronic structure of the obtained samples, XPS was conducted. The XPS survey spectrum confirms the presence of Co, O, F, and N elements in N, F-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, which is consistent with the TEM results (Figure S6c, Supporting Information). The broad peak at 397.9 eV in the N 1s spectra indicates the presence of a Co-N bond in N, F-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> and N-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (Figure S7a, Supporting Information). In the meanwhile, the F 1s survey spectra of N, F-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, and F-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, display the presence of Co-F peaks at 684.4 eV (Figure S7b, Supporting Information). The two most prominent peaks, Co  $2p_{3/2}$  and Co  $2p_{1/2}$  in the Co fine spectra (Figure 3b) are in good agreement with those previously reported for  $Co_3O_4$ . It is noteworthy that the Co  $2p_{3/2}$  (782.88 eV) and Co 2p<sub>1/2</sub> (798.95 eV) spectra of F-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> demonstrate a positive shift to higher energy in comparison with those of Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>. This shift is indicative of an increased electronegativity of the Co<sup>3+</sup> ions within the F-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, as evidenced by the higher electronegativity of fluorine (3.98) in comparison to oxygen (3.44) and nitrogen (3.04). The positions of the characteristic peaks of  $Co^{2+}$  (784.13 and 798.49 eV) and Co<sup>3+</sup> (781.17 and 796.78 eV) in N, F-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> are observed to be shifted to a greater extent toward low binding energy than that of N-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>. The extent toward low binding energy indicates that the Co species in N, F-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> is in a lower valence state. [4] This phenomenon can be attributed to the enhancement

of the hybridization between Co 3d and O 2p, as well as a heightened covalence of Co—O bonds in N, F-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>. The O 1s spectra evidence the presence of three distinct oxygen species, including lattice-O of Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, -OH, and oxygen-containing functional groups adsorbed on the surface (O-Adsorbed)<sup>[18]</sup> (Figure 3c). Of particular note is the positive shift of the peak of lattice-O for N, F-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (530.00 eV) relative to that of Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (529.78 eV), N-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (529.88 eV), and F-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (529.92 eV), thus indicating a higher degree of hybridization between Co 3d and O 2p and covalence of Co—O bonds in N, F-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>.

The local atomic and electronic structures of N, F-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, N-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, F-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, and Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> were also investigated by X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and synchrotron extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS). The Co K-edge XANES spectra indicate that the absorption edge of N-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> is located between that of standard Co foil and Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (Figure 3d). Furthermore, a shift to high energies is observed for F-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (7717.99 eV) in comparison to Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (7717.91 eV) and N-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (7717.58 eV), indicating a higher Co valence. Using first derivative spectra to estimate the valence state (Figure S8, Supporting Information), the Co valence state of N, F-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (0.1992) is lower than that of N-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (1.79) and pristine Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (2.67),

which is in agreement with the XPS results. The EXAFS spectra of Co K-edge of  $Co_3O_4$  reveal three shells at  $\approx 1.481$ ,  $\approx 2.561$ , and  $\approx$ 3.172 Å, corresponding to the Co–O, and Co<sub>oct</sub>-Co<sub>oct</sub> (octahedral site) and Co<sub>tet</sub>-Co<sub>tet</sub> (tetrahedral site) scattering paths, respectively (Figure 3e). Obviously, a slight alteration in the interatomic distance (R) is observed in N, F-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, N-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, and F-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> in comparison to Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>. The Co-O bond length in N, F-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (1.91 Å) was shorter than N-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (1.92 Å), F-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (1.93 Å), and Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (1.92 Å) (Figure S9 and Table S2, Supporting Information), showing a strengthen covalence of Co-O bond in N, F-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>,<sup>[19]</sup> which matches well with theoretical calculation predictions. In addition, the Co<sub>oct</sub>-Co<sub>oct</sub> bond lengths in octahedral (2.89 Å) and  $Co_{tet}$ - $Co_{tet}$  bond lengths in tetrahedral sites (3.34 Å) of N, F-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> are distinctly different from other samples, exhibiting pronounced structural modifications of N, F-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, which suggests that the enhanced covalency is attributed to the synergistic effect between the two distinct crystal fields. In the meanwhile, the coordination number of Co-O in N, F-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (4.8) is notably higher than that of N-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (3.4), F-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (3.8) in comparison to that of Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (3.8), suggesting higher hybridization between Co 3d and O 2p in N, F-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, which is further confirmed by the similar wavelet transform (WT) plots (Figure 3f). In conclusion,

the results of XANES and EXAFS indicate the strengthening of the hybridization between Co 3d and O 2p and the covalence of Co—O in  ${\rm Co_3O_4}$  following the introduction of N and F, which are in agreement with the results of Raman, XPS, and DFT calculations.

The OER activities of  $Co_3O_4$ , N, F- $Co_3O_4$ , N- $Co_3O_4$ , and F- $Co_3O_4$  were evaluated in 1 M KOH using a conventional three-electrode system. The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves indicate that the N, F- $Co_3O_4$  exhibit the most effective OER performance (Figure 4a). As illustrated, the N, F- $Co_3O_4$  require an overpotential of merely 254 mV at the evaluation metrics of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, which is smaller than those of the N- $Co_3O_4$  (283 mV), F- $Co_3O_4$  (290 mV), and  $Co_3O_4$  (326 mV). In addition, the current densities of 100 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> are achieved with an extremely low overpotential of 325 mV for the N, F- $Co_3O_4$ , which are superior to  $Co_3O_4$  (436 mV), N- $Co_3O_4$  (383 mV), and

F-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (422 mV) (Figure 4b). Furthermore, the noteworthy OER performance of N, F-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> is substantiated by the lower Tafel slope of 51.5 mV dec<sup>-1</sup> in comparison to those of N-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>  $(57.7 \text{ mV dec}^{-1})$ , F-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>  $(57.1 \text{ mV dec}^{-1})$  and Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (67.5 mV)dec<sup>-1</sup>). This indicates that the OER kinetics of N, F-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> are faster, with the former demonstrating enhanced OER performance (Figure 4c). Moreover, N, F-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> exhibits superior OER performance in comparison to other reported Co-based catalysts which were prepared by various methods including plasma. (Figure 4d; Table S3, Supporting Information).

In addition, the N, F-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> still delivers a higher ECSA-normalized current density than N-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, F-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, and Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, suggesting

excellent intrinsic OER performance (Figure 4e). The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) technique was utilized to assess the charge transfer properties of the obtained electrocatalysts. The corresponding Nyquist plots at various potentials are presented in Figure S11 (Supporting Information). It is evident from these plots that the radius of the semicircle in the low-frequency range diminishes with an increase in the applied potential, signifying that the charge transfer in these catalysts predominantly occurs via the low-frequency pathway. The Bode plots of N, F-Co3O4 exhibit smaller phase angles than those of the other samples at the same potential (Figure 4f; Figure S12, Supporting Information), which demonstrates the facilitating of interface reaction charge transfer and the faster OER kinetics.[\[20\]](#page-10-0) To investigate the correlation between doping levels and catalyst properties, control samples were prepared by regulating NH4F plasma treatment time.

species in the OER process of Co-based electrocatalysts. [21] However, the absence of the peak at 572 cm $^{-1}$  in 1.3 V indicates that the surface of  $\rm Co_3O_4$  N- $\rm Co_3O_4$  and F- $\rm Co_3O_4$  is unable to generate high-valence Co species at this voltage. Furthermore, the Raman peaks of  $\rm Co^{IV}$ -O in N, F- $\rm Co_3O_4$  manifest at lower potentials in comparison to those of  $\rm Co_3O_4$ , indicating that the Co species within N, F- $\rm Co_3O_4$  are more prone to oxidation subsequent to the incorporation of N and F. As the potential increases, the peak of  $\rm A_{1g}$  in N, F- $\rm Co_3O_4$  broadens, and the intensity diminishes, which can be attributed to the participation of lattice oxygen in OER. [22]

To gain comprehensive insights into the impact of the simultaneous incorporation of N and F on the OER activity, further investigation was conducted to explore the OER pathway of different samples. In contrast to the conventional AEM pathway, the LOM is a non-concerted proton-electron transfer pathway, exhibiting strong pH-dependent OER activity. Consequently, the OER performance of N, F-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, and control samples was initially evaluated in different pH environments. As illustrated in Figure 5e and Figure \$16 (Supporting Information), the current densities of the N, F-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> exhibited a pronounced increase with pH from 12 to 14 compared to Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, indicating the involvement of a nonconcerted proton-electron transfer pathway. [23] The pH dependence is closely related to the proton reaction order  $(\rho)$ , with the following order of magnitude: N, F-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (0.76) >  $N-Co_3O_4$  (0.74) >  $F-Co_3O_4$  (0.66) >  $Co_3O_4$  (0.58). In general, a value of  $\rho$  close to 1 indicates a preferential LOM pathway, suggesting that N, F-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> undergoes the LOM pathway. [24] Furthermore, the most pronounced pH-dependent behavior observed in N, F-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> indicates that the lattice oxygen redox chemistry of Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> can be most effectively activated through the doping of N and F. To validate the LOM mechanism, tetramethylammonium cations (TMA<sup>+</sup>) were employed as a chemical probe for negatively charged peroxide/superoxide ion  $(O_2^{2-}/O^{2-})$  intermediates.<sup>[23,25]</sup> It is notable that the current density of N, F-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> exhibits a pronounced decline in 1 M tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAOH), with the increase of Tafel slope from 51.5 to 143.4 mV dec<sup>-1</sup> (Figure 5f). This observation suggests that the LOM process in N, F-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> is significantly impeded by TMA+, due to the inhibition of the LOM mechanism with strong binding of TMA<sup>+</sup>. Nevertheless, the OER activities of Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> exhibited minimal variation in the 1 m TMAOH system in comparison to the reaction system with 1 м КОН. Furthermore, the current density of N-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> and F-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> also demonstrates a notable reduction in 1 M TMAOH, which substantiates the efficacy of the anion doping strategy (Figure S17, Supporting Information). Due to the isotope effect, the LOM pathway was further identified by the oxygen isotope strategy. A three-step strategy is employed for the oxygen isotope labeling experiments.<sup>[18]</sup> Initially, the asprepared N, F-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> are labeled in a 0.1 м KOH H<sub>2</sub><sup>18</sup>O aqueous solution (denoted as <sup>18</sup>O-KOH) with a chronoamperometry method for 20 min at 1.664 V. Subsequently, the <sup>18</sup>O-labeled N, F-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (denoted as N, F-Co<sub>3</sub> <sup>18</sup>O<sub>4</sub>) sample was transferred into an aqueous solution of 0.1 M KOH-H<sub>2</sub> <sup>16</sup>O (<sup>16</sup>O-KOH). Moreover, <sup>18</sup>O isotope technology in conjunction with online differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS) was employed to detect the generation of O<sub>2</sub> gas during the OER (Figure \$18, Supporting Information). As illustrated in Figure 5g, the signals for the mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of 32 and 34, corresponding to <sup>32</sup>O<sub>2</sub> (16O16O) and 34O2 (16O18O), respectively, are detected for N, F-

 $\text{Co}_3\text{O}_4$ . This confirms the involvement of lattice oxygen in the OER. In light of the aforementioned analysis, it can be inferred that the LOM mechanism represents an energetically favorable pathway for  $\text{Co}_3\text{O}_4$  following the introduction of N and F.

To better understand the correlation between the electronic structure and OER catalytic mechanism, a series of firstprinciples calculations were conducted utilizing DFT. Subsequent analysis was then applied to the oxygen evolution processes occurring on the different configurations, as well as the Gibbs free energy for the evolution of different intermediates in both the AEM and the LOM pathways. The AEM and LOM pathways, comprising five distinct elementary steps, are illustrated in Figures S19–S22 (Supporting Information) respectively. As illustrated, the AEM pathway is characterized by concerted proton-electron transfer processes involving four reactive oxygen species: M-OH, M-O, M-OOH, and M-OO (M represents the transition metal).[23] In contrast to the AEM, the LOM follows a different route, which involves the direct coupling of the \*O intermediate with active lattice oxygen. This route is represented by the dashed box in Figure 5h and includes the steps O-M-OH, MOO, OO—M-\*, and M—OH. The bold O in the figure denotes the lattice oxygen active site, and the \* symbol represents an oxygen vacancy. As illustrated in Figure S23 (Supporting Information), for Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, the rate-determining step (RDS) for the AEM pathway is the formation of \*O with a  $\Delta G$  of 1.656 at 1.23 V, which is less than the 1.742 eV of the RDS for the LOM pathway. Therefore, the OER process of Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> can be regarded as following the conventional AEM pathway. In the case of N, F-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, the formation of \*O remains the RDS for the AEM pathway (1.395 eV). Conversely, the RDS for the LOM pathway involves the construction of an O-O bridge by means of \*OH adsorption, a process that exhibits a significantly lower  $\Delta G$  (1.310 eV) in comparison to that of the AEM pathway. A similar outcome is observed in the LOM pathway, where the RDS is also to construct the O–O bridge. As shown in Figure 5i, the  $\Delta G$  of the RDS in the LOM pathway of N, F-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> is considerably lower than that of N-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (1.384 eV) and F-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (1.388 eV). Consequently, these results strongly provide substantial evidence that N, F-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> predominantly follows the LOM pathway as opposed to the conventional AEM pathway, which is in alignment with the experimental results.

Apart from activity, stability is another major concern for evaluating the application of electrocatalysts. The stability of the obtained catalysts was assessed under a constant current density in 1 м КОН. As presented in Figure 6a-d, the N, F-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> exhibit excellent stability, with only a negligible increase in overpotential (2 mV) observed after 240 h of continuous operation at 20 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, which is superiorer than that of Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (70 mV), N-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (30 mV), and F-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (30 mV). The inductively coupled plasmamass spectrometry (ICP-MS) experiments were performed to monitor the Co ion dissolution amount in the electrolyte during the OER process. Co undergoes continuous dissolution into the electrolyte while simultaneously redepositing onto the catalyst surface, resulting in a dynamic equilibrium within the electrolyte where cobalt concentration initially increases before gradually decreasing. The amount of dissolved Co ions observed for N, F-Co<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> is less than other electrocatalysts (Figure 6e), suggesting that N and F played an important role in inhibiting Co dissolution. Furthermore, a serious of characterizations

including SEM, XRD, and TEM were performed for N, F-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>. Obviously, the nanowire structure of N, F-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> still maintains its integrity after the stability test (Figure S24, Supporting Information). The XRD pattern indicates that there is no phase change in N, F-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> after the stability test (Figure S25, Supporting Information). The edge of the nanoparticles in N, F-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> remains indistinct after the stability test, and the EDS mapping indicates that Co, O, F, and N are still uniformly distributed on the nanowires (Figure S26, Supporting Information). The Barder charge analysis demonstrates the presence of Co-O hybridization of Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, N, F-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, N-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, and F-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> An increase in the value of the charge difference is indicative of an elevated degree of hybridization, which in turn is associated with a strengthening of the valence bond. The charge difference (Co-O) values for Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, N, F-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, N-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, and F-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> are 1.857, 1.879, 1.867, and 1.867, respectively (Figure 6f). Obviously, the strength of Co-O in N, F-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> is the strongest, compared to other electrocatalysts. Therefore, the stability of N, F-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> is the most superior. In addition, the N, F-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> catalyst demonstrates exceptional durability with merely 13 mV overpotential change over 480 h continuous operation at 150 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, and 26 mV change after 140 h testing at 400 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> (Figure S27, Supporting Information). These results demonstrate the suitability of N, F-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> for practical implementation in high-demand electrochemical systems.

Considering the potential for multi-scenario applications, the electrolysis performance in seawater was evaluated in a mixed solution of 1 m KOH and 0.5 m NaCl. As shown in Figure S28 (Supporting Information), electrochemical results demonstrate that in 1 M KOH + 0.5 M NaCl, the N, F-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> catalyst exhibits an overpotential of 285 mV at a current density of 20 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, significantly outperforming N-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (302 mV), F-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (305 mV), and the pristine Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (315 mV). Concurrently, the Tafel slope of N, F-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (91.22 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>) is lower than those of N-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (114.16 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>), F-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (119.58 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>), and the pristine  $\text{Co}_3\text{O}_4$  (129.24 mV dec $^{-1}$ ). In addition, the N, F- $\text{Co}_3\text{O}_4$  catalyst demonstrates exceptional durability with merely 28 mV overpotential change over 140 h continuous operation at 150 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> in 1 м KOH + 0.5 м NaCl. To investigate the cell performance, the 20 wt% Pt/C powders were sprayed onto titanium fiber felt, which was employed as the cathode catalyst, and utilized a selfsynthesized Co-based catalyst as the anode catalyst to assemble the overall water-splitting device. As shown in Figure S29 (Supporting Information), the polarization curve of the device was first measured, followed by a stability test of the water electrolysis system with the N, F-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> anode. The results demonstrate that the N, F-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>||Pt/C system exhibits the optimal overall water-splitting catalytic performance, requiring only 1.69/1.76 V to achieve current densities of 100/200 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> respectively.

### **3. Conclusion**

In summary, we report a novel plasma strategy to introduce N and F in Co3O4 simultaneously as the heteroatoms, which enables the OER to occur via the LOM pathway. The results of Raman, XPS, XANES, and EXAFS indicated that the introduction of N and F can lead to an enhancement in the Co─O covalence. The combination of the pH dependence, the TMA<sup>+</sup> probe, and DEMS measurements revealed that the lattice oxygen in N, F-Co3O4 was activated successfully to take part in the OER process. The N, F-Co3O4 sample exhibits superior OER performance with an overpotential of 254 mV at 10 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> and superior stability at 20, 150, and 400 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2. The outstanding OER performance in 1 m KOH+0.5 m NaCl and the excellent functionality of the twoelectrode overall water-splitting device collectively demonstrate the applicability of N, F-Co3O4 for water electrolysis across diverse scenarios. This work provides new insight into doping anions in spinel oxides and designing highly efficient LOM-based catalysts on this basis.

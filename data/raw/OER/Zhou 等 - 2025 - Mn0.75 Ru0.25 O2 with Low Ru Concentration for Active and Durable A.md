# **Mn0.75Ru0.25O2 with Low Ru Concentration for Active and Durable Acidic Oxygen Evolution**

*Daojin Zhou,\* Yuxin Chang, Jialun Tang, and Pengfei Ou\**

**Ruthenium has emerged as a promising alternative to iridium in water-splitting anodes. However, it becomes overoxidized and dissolves at industry-relevant working conditions. To enhance the activity and stability of electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction, an isostructural rutile MnRu oxide with low Ru concentration (Mn0.75Ru0.25O2) is synthesized and an asymmetric Mn-O-Ru dual-site active center is developed. It exhibits 154 mV overpotential at 10 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> and can operate stably at 200 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> for 670 h with a degradation rate of 29 uV/h<sup>−</sup>1. A proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer achieves stable operation at 1 A cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> for 700 h with a degradation rate of 53 uV h<sup>−</sup>1. Structural analysis and isotopic labeling correlate the asymmetric nature of the Mn-O-Ru dual-site active center, which facilitates the oxygen evolution reaction along the radical coupling pathway, with the stabilization of the cations and the lattice oxygen in isostructural rutile Mn0.75Ru0.25O2.**

# **1. Introduction**

Proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolyzers for green hydrogen production combine merits in high current density, low corrosion, and long-term durability. Commercial PEM electrolyzers rely on IrO2 or Ir-rich electrocatalysts at the anode in light of their excellent activity and stability under acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) conditions.[\[1\]](#page-6-0) However, the high cost and low availability of Ir are of concern as the electrolyzer industry seeks to scale to GW-levels[\[2\]](#page-6-0) (Table S1, Supporting information). Ru-based OER electrocatalysts are promising alternatives to Ir owing to their lower cost[\[3\]](#page-6-0) and high OER

activity in acidic electrolytes. However, their vulnerabilities in acidic environments due to the overoxidation of Ru and the oxidation of lattice oxygen at working conditions set a critical barrier to replacing Ir with Ru for green hydrogen production via PEM electrolyzer. These challenges have motivated researchers to explore strategies such as doping,[\[4–11\]](#page-6-0) strain engineering,[\[12,13\]](#page-6-0) and the utilization of supports,[\[14\]](#page-6-0) such as TiO*<sup>x</sup>* and MnO*x*, [\[15,16\]](#page-6-0) that stabilize the active species.

Along with the electrocatalyst design, discovering alternative OER pathways, in addition to the adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM), has also attracted rising popularity. In one recent study,[\[9\]](#page-6-0) an array of Ru atoms was introduced onto -MnO2, showcasing the potential for Ru-O-Ru motifs to

facilitate oxygen evolution through direct radical coupling (I2M/OPM), the approach leading to an impressive increase in activity. However, the unprotected Ru-O-Ru motifs still face the challenging stability issue. Based on the origin of instability of pure RuO2 under working conditions, we postulated that a generalized and asymmetric M-O-Ru motif built-in isostructural rutile metal oxide could potentially increase the union of stability and activity if it fulfilled these conditions simultaneously: 1) Each of M must be OER active to serve, together with Ru, as dual-site to implement the radical coupling step to generate M-O; 2) M possesses a weaker electronegativity, donating electron from M to Ru, thereby enriching the electron density at the Ru site and militating against Ru overoxidation during OER; 3) In this way, M would establish strong bonds with lattice oxygen, further increasing the stability of the lattice oxygen; 4) Finally, M should have a coordination geometry similar to that of Ru, then the introduction of Ru to MO2 will follow isomorphism and does not cause severe lattice distortion, nor change the coordination environment.

To enhance both the activity and stability of Ru-doped rutile metal oxide, we chose -MnO2 as the matrix and synthesized MnRu-based electrocatalysts using direct spraying followed by air annealing. We examined how various synthetic parameters, including elemental composition and post-calcination temperature, influenced the activity of MnRuO*<sup>x</sup>* (**Figure 1**[a\)](#page-1-0). After screening different experimental conditions, we sprayed RuCl3 and MnCl2 precursors in an atomic ratio of 1:3, followed by annealing in air at 400 °C for 1 h.

Inductively coupled plasma (ICP) measurements revealed that the optimized composition was Mn0.75Ru0.25O2. X-ray diffraction

Homemade RuO2 and commercial RuO2 share a similar Ru-O bond length, while a positive shift of Ru-O bond length can be observed in Mn0.75Ru0.25O2, suggesting the lower valence state of Ru in Mn0.75Ru0.25O2. g) Mn 2*p* XPS spectra of Mn0.75Ru0.25O2 compared with MnO2. h) Mn *K*-edge XAS spectra of Mn0.75Ru0.25O2, homemade MnO2, and commercial MnO2. i) Mn EXAFS spectra of Mn0.75Ru0.25O2, homemade MnO2, and commercial MnO2. Homemade MnO2 and commercial MnO2 share a similar Ru-O bond length, while a negative shift of Mn-O bond length can be observed in Mn0.75Ru0.25O2, suggesting the higher valence state of Mn in Mn0.75Ru0.25O2.

(Figure 1b) indicated a rutile structure of the Mn0.75Ru0.25O2 solid solution, in agreement with Vegard's law. The catalysts had a rough surface and uniform distribution of elements (Figure 1c, Table S2, SEM, Figure S1, TEM, Figures S2, S3, Supporting information). The nanostructures exhibited (110) facets with a plane spacing of 0.31 nm (Figure S3, Supporting information). We examined the electronic structure and coordination environment on the Ru and Mn sites. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) revealed a shift in the Ru 3*p* peaks in Mn0.75Ru0.25O2 to lower binding energies (0.4 eV) compared to those of electrodeposited RuO2 (Figure 1d) and a similar negative shift of 1.3 eV in the Ru *K*-edge using X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS, *K* space fitting results are shown in Figure S4, Supporting information) (Figure 1e). These negative shifts corresponded to electron transfer from Mn to Ru sites and a reduced Ru oxidation state.

Further analysis of the electronic structure of the Mn sites showed a new XPS peak at 643 eV (Figure 1g) and a positive shift of 0.4 eV in the Mn *K*-edge in XAS compared to MnO2 (Figure 1h), suggesting that Ru doping leads to electron-deficient

Mn sites. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) analysis indicated that the Mn─O bond was shortened by 0.04 Å, while the Ru-O bond was elongated by 0.08 Å (Figure [1f,i\)](#page-1-0). Notably, a shorter distance between the metal cations in the M-O-M (di--oxo) coordination, measured at 2.5–2.7 Å (Figure [1f,i\)](#page-1-0), was observed in Mn0.75Ru0.25O2 compared to that in the electrodeposited RuO2 and MnO2.

We sought first to replicate benchmark studies (Figures S5–S8, Supporting information) by Cherevko,[\[2,18\]](#page-6-0) Chorkendorff,[\[19\]](#page-6-0) and Strasser.[\[20\]](#page-6-0) The agreement was good, and we discussed the results from three-electrode, single-cell tests. The electrochemical surface area (ECSA) of each electrocatalyst was determined from CV capacitance measurements and used to normalize the current density of the polarization curves (Figure S9, Supporting information). As seen in **Figure 2**a, Mn0.75Ru0.25O2 required 290 mV overpotential to achieve a current density of 100 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2, compared to 330 mV for RuO2 and 390 mV for IrO2. The discrepancy between activity results in Figures [1a](#page-1-0) and 2a can be attributed to the scan rate difference, as we run a fast polarization curves test (100 mV/s) first to reveal the best synthetic parameters, and then characterize the activity of the best sample in a standard procedure (5 mV/s). OER performance evaluation using glassy carbon as a working electrode, as shown in Figure S10 (Supporting information), showed that Mn0.75Ru0.25O2 required 154 mV

overpotential at 10 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2. Mn0.75Ru0.25O2 also exhibited a lower Tafel slope of 32.9 mV dec<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> (Figure [2b\)](#page-2-0), a lower charge transfer resistance (Figure [2c](#page-2-0) and Figure S11, Supporting information), and a lower activation energy (Figure [2d\)](#page-2-0). To prepare for stability studies, Figure [2e](#page-2-0) shows that Mn0.75Ru0.25O2 achieved over 670 h at 200 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> with a degradation rate of 29 uV h<sup>−</sup>1, the lowest rate reported for an acidic Ir-free OER electrocatalyst at this current density and being comparable to IrO2. To ascertain whether the oxidation current originated from OER, we employed a rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE) setup with a platinum ring electrode held at the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) potential of 0.4 V (vs RHE) to monitor the production of O2 gas (Figure S12a,b, Supporting information). The reduction current observed on the ring electrode indicated that the oxidation current could be entirely attributed to the OER, accounting for ≈100%. This result was also validated by quantification of generated oxygen at 200 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> for 670 h using the inverted cylinder method, showing a 99.7% faradaic efficiency of OER (Figure S12c, Supporting information).

We used ICP to study the rate of loss[\[2,18,19\]](#page-6-0) of Ru and Mn at 200 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2. The reference catalyst RuO2 loses 53% of its Ru over 50 h, and the MnO2 loses 40% over 50 h. In contrast, the optimized Mn0.75Ru0.25O2 loses only 3.4% of its Ru and 2.6% of its Mn over 700 h at this same current density (Figures S13, S14, Supporting information). In Figure [2f,](#page-2-0) we compare the stability of Mn0.75Ru0.25O2 to other reported Rubased electrocatalysts,[\[4,9,21–29\]](#page-6-0) Mn0.75Ru0.25O2 shows a stable operation at the highest current density while only presenting the lowest degradation rate among all listed references. Nernst shift induced by dissolved cations in the confined electrolyte can result in artificial stabilization of catalysts,[\[30,31\]](#page-6-0) so we used a PEM water electrolyzer to evaluate the performance of Mn0.75Ru0.25O2 (0.2 mg cm<sup>−</sup>2) at 50 °C (polarization curve in Figure S15, Supporting information and stability data in Figure [2g\)](#page-2-0). Mn0.75Ru0.25O2 operated stably for 730 h at 1 A cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> with a degradation rate of 53 uV h<sup>−</sup>1.

In situ XAS was used to track the electronic structure during the reaction as a function of applied potential. The *K* edges of both Ru and Mn underwent a positive shift as the anodic potential increased; they returned to their initial energy upon return to open circuit voltage (OCV) (**Figure 3**a,b and Figures S16, S17, Supporting information). Thus, the redox behavior and coordination environment of metal sites is reversible (Table S3, Supporting information), another requirement of stable OER catalysts. Since Mn shifted, we further investigated the participation of Mn in OER through cyclic voltammetry (CV) scans. In the Rudoped sample, the reduction peak of MnO2 at ≈1.28 V (vs RHE) was shifted by +40 mV, consistent with the reduction of Mn in Mn0.75Ru0.25O2 (Figure S18, Supporting information). When we ran the CVs in the 18O-labelled electrolyte, the reduction peak for Mn0.75Ru0.25O2 was shifted by +20 mV shift compared to using H2 16O-labeled electrolyte, evidence of an interaction of Mn with O from the electrolyte (Figure S19, Supporting information).

In situ attenuated total reflectance-surface enhanced infrared spectroscopy (ATR-SEIRAS) was used to track the formation of oxygen-contained intermediates on the surface. An M-OOH

intermediate was observed for RuO2 (Figure [3c\)](#page-3-0), indicating the OER followed the AEM pathway, while we observed a shoulder peak at 1085 cm<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> assigned to a radical-induced O─O bond[\[9,32–35\]](#page-6-0) on Mn0.75Ru0.25O2 (Figure [3d\)](#page-3-0). This corresponds to bridge-linked oxygens between the shorter oxygen-linked metal sites (M-O-O-M), an intermediate observed in the radical coupling mechanism (I2M). When the anolyte was switched from H2 16O to H2 18O, we saw a redshift (Figure S20, Supporting information), but not when we switched the anolyte from H2O to D2O (Figure S21, Supporting information): from this we conclude that 18Ocontaining intermediates, not the hydrogen-containing intermediates such as M-OOH, were involved in OER. We thus propose that both Ru and Mn sites participate via the I2M OER pathway when Mn0.75Ru0.25O2 operates in acid. Our findings appear to diverge from earlier studies[\[36,37\]](#page-6-0) concerning MnRu metal oxides: here we note that the catalyst in this work was in the rutile crystal structure, and the active center involved Mn-O-Ru dual-site, where prior studies have included metal alloy or mixed structural systems.

To further assess the stability of the catalysts, we looked for changes in the metal-oxygen covalency in Mn0.75Ru0.25O2 upon doping with Ru. The XPS O 1*s* spectra showed that for Mn0.75Ru0.25O2, a new O binding peak at 530.0 eV emerged (Figure S22, Supporting information), one ascribed to covalent lattice oxygen.[\[38,39\]](#page-6-0) By integrating the area of the O peaks between 527–532 eV, associated with excitation from O 1*s* to 2*p* bands, we found that Mn0.75Ru0.25O2 exhibited a large metaloxygen covalency compared to RuO2 and MnO2 (Figure S23, Supporting information).[\[40\]](#page-6-0) Valence band and EELS spectra (Figure S24, Supporting information) also indicate enhanced hybridization and bond covalency between O 2*p* with metal 3*d* orbitals.[\[41\]](#page-6-0) In situ Raman (Figure [3e,f\)](#page-3-0) showed that the Ru─O bond (515 cm<sup>−</sup>1) in RuO2 has a prominent redshift (515 to 536 cm<sup>−</sup>1, corresponding to Ru─O bond) under prolonged operation, whereas we only saw a limited Raman shift (662–673 cm<sup>−</sup>1, corresponding to Mn─O bond) in Mn0.75Ru0.25O2 can be observed. The redshift of the Raman peak can be ascribed to the shortened metal-oxygen bond at anodic potential. However, a more obvious redshift in RuO2 can be attributed to a more severe oxidation of RuO2 in the electrolyte.

Using in situ differential electrochemical mass spectroscopy (DEMS) and H2 18O-labeled anolyte, we assessed the stability of lattice oxygen during the reaction (Figures S25, S26, Supporting information). 42% of oxygen molecules produced had a molecular mass of 36 in the case of homemade RuO2, while the corresponding figure was 76% in the case of Mn0.75Ru0.25O2. Thus, a higher fraction of lattice oxygen (16O) participated in the reaction with 18O from the anolyte for RuO2 compared to Mn0.75Ru0.25O2; we conclude that the lattice oxygen participation was suppressed on Mn0.75Ru0.25O2.

To summarize our conclusions to this point: introducing Ru into rutile MnO2 leads to electron donation from Mn to Ru, yielding a lower valence state for Ru and a stretched Ru─O bond, thus preventing Ru sites from over-oxidizing and forming soluble H2RuO5. At the same time, electron transfer between Ru and Mn increases the bond strength and covalency between Mn and O, stabilizing lattice oxygen in this structure. Ru has high lattice affinity within MnO2 in light of crystal isomorphism, minimizing lattice distortion and vacancies.

To explore activity and stability in Mn0.75Ru0.25O2, we carried out a finer variation in the Mn:Ru composition to ascertain the degree of sensitivity to the precise Mn:Ru ratio. Two samples possessed a higher proportion of Ru (Mn0.5Ru0.5O2 and Mn0.66Ru0.33O2), and the other two had greater Mn content (Mn0.9Ru0.1O2 and Mn0.8Ru0.2O2). We used ATR-SEIRAS and DEMS to assess the working mechanism and lattice oxygen stability. As seen in ATR-SEIRAS and DEMS spectra in Figures S27–S29 (Supporting information), the minor Ru content in Mn-rich Mn0.8Ru0.1O2 and Mn0.8Ru0.2O2 triggers Mn to participate in OER, creating asymmetrical Mn-O-Ru active sites that facilitate the OER through the I2M pathway. However, due to the lower concentration of Mn-O-Ru motifs, a higher overpotential is required to achieve the desired OER current density. Conversely, when Ru constitutes over one-third of the cations in Mn0.5Ru0.5O2 and Mn0.66Ru0.33O2, it becomes the sole active OER site. This mechanism follows the adsorbate evolution pathway and results in a significant loss of lattice oxygen (consistent with previous RuO2 reaction and stabilization mechanisms). In contrast, the Mn0.75Ru0.25O2 solid solution reported in this study achieves a balance, enhancing both acidic OER activity and stability. This is achieved by introducing the highest percentage of Mn-O-Ru asymmetrical dual OER sites to enhance activity, while simultaneously safeguarding lattice oxygen to improve stability.

We conducted postmortem analysis (Figures S30–S35, Supporting information), following 670 h of operation of Mn0.75Ru0.25O2 at 200 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2, that included XRD, SEM, XPS, and in situ ATR-SEIRAS and DEMS. The catalyst maintains crystal structure, morphology, and electronic structure. One main ATR-SEIRAS peak corresponding to M-O-O-M is discerned (Figure S35a, Supporting information), suggesting that although the Mn:Ru ratio changes (Table S4, Supporting information), the surface sites associated with I2M are still preserved. In Figure S35b (Supporting information), the stability of lattice oxygen is affirmed, providing further evidence of the consistent performance of this acidic OER electrocatalyst. While the elemental ratio in Mn*x*Ru1-*x*O2 may vary, the exposed facets, electronic structure of active sites, and working mechanism remain preserved, along with the limited decay in OER activity (Figure S36, Supporting information).

For DFT calculations we used a slab model consisting of - MnO2(110) (110 facet is the dominant facet as revealed by XRD, and the most stable facet) in which a Ru atom substituted a Mn atom at the surface to represent the Mn0.75Ru0.25O2. Free energy diagrams for MnO2(110) with and without Ru, considering both WNA and I2M mechanisms (**Figure 4**[a,b](#page-5-0) and Figures S37–S40, Supporting information). The calculation results show that Mn-Ru facilitates the I2M mechanism, where \*OH couples with a nearby \*O with \*H migrating to form an Mn-O-O-Ru bridge (Figure [4c](#page-5-0) and Figure S41, Supporting information), and contributes to a low overpotential of 0.36 V. In comparison, MnO2(110) follows the WNA mechanism (\* <sup>→</sup> \*OH <sup>→</sup> \*O <sup>→</sup> \*OOH <sup>→</sup> O2) with a calculated overpotential of 0.63 V (Figure [4d](#page-5-0) and Figure S42, Supporting information). Results in Figure S43 (Supporting information) show that a 0.49 V onset overpotential is required on RuO2(110) following the WNA mechanism. This is consistent with in situ FTIR observing a M-O-O-M

intermediate at 1085  $\text{cm}^{-1}$  on the surface of  $\text{Mn}_{0.75}\text{Ru}_{0.25}\text{O}_2$  at OER potential (Figure 3c). We looked at the effect of Ru on the charge distribution and oxidation states in MnO<sub>2</sub> (Figure 4e,f). Ru doping results in electron transfer from Mn via O to Ru, thus stabilizing the low valence state of the Ru atom. This may suggest why experiments also revealed a decrease in overoxidation. Bader charge analysis indicates an increase in the covalency of the metal-oxygen bond. We also considered the effect of oxygen vacancies at the surface, which are typically present experimentally and have been implicated in dissolution mechanisms. We modeled the formation of an oxygen vacancy  $\Delta E_{\text{form}}^{O_{\text{vac}}}$  by removing one lattice of oxygen O<sub>3f</sub> using the surface termination without O<sub>br</sub>. [42] Other scenarios of O<sub>vac</sub> formation in a different surface termination are shown in Figures S44-S46 (Supporting information). MnO<sub>2</sub>(110) and RuO<sub>2</sub> (110) exhibit a  $\Delta \tilde{E}_{\text{form}}^{\sigma_{\text{vac}}}$  of 0.57 eV (Figure 4g) and 0.91 eV (Figure S46, Supporting information), respectively. In contrast,  $\Delta E_{\text{form}}^{\text{o}_{\text{vac}}}$  increased on Ru-doped MnO<sub>2</sub>(110) to 1.20 eV (Figure 4h), suggesting that the Ru-doped MnO<sub>2</sub> surface containing asymmetric Mn-O-Ru is less prone to the formation of O<sub>vac</sub> than MnO<sub>2</sub> or RuO<sub>2</sub>, consistent with experimental observations.

### 2. Conclusion

In summary, we synthesized an isostructural, low Ru concentration rutile oxide of  $Mn_{0.75}Ru_{0.25}O_2$  OER electrocatalyst that showed stable (53 uV h<sup>-1</sup>) acidic OER performance at 1 A cm<sup>-2</sup> in a PEM device. Experiments show that including Ru within

isostructural rutile, MnO<sub>2</sub> led to asymmetric Mn-O-Ru as the dual-site active center in acidic OER, achieving a kinetically favorable OER pathway along with improved stability of metal cations and lattice oxygen. In situ spectroscopy and isotopic labeling studies indicated the radical coupling mechanism and high lattice oxygen stability, in agreement with electrochemical performance. This work advances the goal of preparing Ir-free acidic OER electrocatalysts at industrially relevant current density. At the same time, we note that the present results, while promising, leave further room for improvement: the goal of long-term (multi-year) operation in an industrial PEMWE setting requires further effort.

#### **Abstract**

Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting devices have attracted a lot of interest in academia and industry as an environmentally friendly approach to generate clean hydrogen fuels. But the stability of the PEC water splitting devices is still a huge challenge in this field. In this work, we have studied the effect of different alkaline electrolytes on 5 nm Ni/SiO<sub>X</sub>/n-Si/Ti photoanodes by PEC, chemical and morphologic characterizations. Although the photoanode at 1 M KOH (pH 14) shows low onset potential (1.191 V vs. RHE), it starts to decay after ~141 h PEC tests due to

the formation of pinholes. However, PEC tests using a mixture electrolyte of KOH and LiOH (pH 12.5) or the mixture electrolyte of K-borate and Li-borate (pH 9.5) show stability >264 h due to the presence of lithium ions. Compared to the measurement at pH 9.5 with Li ions electrolyte, 5 nm Ni/SiO<sub>X</sub>/n-Si/Ti photoanode at pH 12.5 electrolyte shows a lower onset potential of 1.254 V vs. RHE for water oxidation, which only shows an overpotential of 0.024 V. The pH 12.5 solution made of KOH and LiOH can be an attractive electrolyte to enhance the activity and lifetime of silicon-based photoanodes for PEC water splitting devices.

### Introduction

Since Fujishima et al.<sup>[1]</sup> developed the first (n-type TiO<sub>2</sub>) electrodes for water photolysis in 1972, sunlight-driven photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting has been one of the most promising approaches to produce clean and sustainable energy. Using this method, inexhaustible solar energy can be used to split molecules of water (H<sub>2</sub>O) and produce abundant hydrogen, which is an attractive clean fuel that can be easily stored and transported. [2,3,4] PEC water splitting systems use semiconducting photoelectrodes immersed in a liquid electrolyte that, when illuminated, can generate free electron-hole pairs, leading to a net exchange of charges with the electrolyte that results in the splitting of water molecules. This process consists of two chemical half reactions named oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), which take place on the surface of the photoanode and photocathode, respectively. Silicon is an excellent candidate material for being used as photoelectrode for splitting water due to its high photon absorption and low price, and several Si-based photoelectrodes for PEC water splitting have been reported. [5-8] However, silicon corrodes easily in alkaline and acid electrolytes, which results in premature failure of the entire device. In order to solve this problem, one easy and effective solution is to coat the surface of silicon photoelectrodes with a protective metallic layer, which at the same time can act as catalyzer, improving both the activity and stability of the PEC water splitting system. This solution

has been also employed in other wide band-gap semiconductors,<sup>[9-18]</sup> metals,<sup>[8,19-23]</sup> and other variety of materials<sup>[7,25-28]</sup> considered as photoelectrode for PEC water splitting solar cells.

Materials based on first-row transition metal have been widely used as coating on silicon photoelectrodes for PEC water splitting. Especially, Ni based coatings (e.g. Ni, NiOx) have attracted a lot of interest in the field of water splitting due to their low cost and good ability to enhance the activity and stability of the photoelectrodes. [16-21,23,24] Gong et al. [24] summarized the most relevant research progress using Ni-based catalysts to generate highly active HER in the alkaline electrolytes. Moreover, Ni-based catalysts can also produce fast OER in alkaline conditions. Kenney et al. [19] fabricated 2 nm Ni coated n-Si photoanodes that exhibited a very low onset potential (V<sub>ON</sub>) of ~1.07 V vs. RHE in 1 M KOH, but its stability was only ~12 hours. In our previous work. [20] we have statistically analyzed the aging mechanisms of similar 2 nm Ni coated ntype Si photoanodes in 1 M KOH, and we found that the performance decayed fast due to the formation of a thick interfacial SiO<sub>X</sub> film that blocked the current. In n-Si photoanodes coated with thicker Ni films (>5 nm) the degradation was slowed down, achieving stabilities of ~156 hours. In this case, the mechanism triggering the failure of the device changed: the thicker Ni film avoided oxidation of the underlying n-Si by blocking oxygen ion penetration, but prolonged exposure to KOH resulted on the formation of pinholes on the surface of the Ni film. However, the use of thicker Ni coatings reduces the amount of sunlight penetrating into the underlying n-Si photoanode, resulting in a lower activity at pH 14 (i.e. the  $V_{ON}$  of 2 nm Ni/SiO<sub>X</sub>/n-Si photoanodes is ~1.07 V vs. RHE, while the  $V_{ON}$  of 5 nm Ni/SiO<sub>X</sub>/n-Si photoanodes is ~1.37 V vs. RHE<sup>[19,20]</sup>). Therefore, this presents an important trade off when designing metal-coated Si photoanodes, and a still unresolved dilemma.

One potential solution to avoid this problem is the use of thicker  $NiO_X$  coatings, which can effectively passivate the surface of the silicon based photoelectrode and at the same time allow effective light transmission. Using this concept idea, Sun et al. [16,17] stabilized n-type Si photoanodes by coating them with a >50 nm thick  $NiO_X$ -based p-type conducting oxide, and

achieved  $V_{ON}$  of 1.36 V vs. RHE and a stability of ~600 hours in 1 M KOH electrolyte. The performance of these cells was further improved by using np<sup>+</sup>-Si photoanodes, which generate a larger built-in potential and promote more abundant electron-hole separation (compared to n-type Si), leading to larger photocurrents. As a result, the authors managed to fabricate a >50 nm  $NiO_X/np^+$ -Si photoanode that exhibited  $V_{ON}$  1.03 V vs. RHE and a stability of ~1200 hours. However, the use of much thicker coatings and  $np^+$ -Si junctions remarkably increases the fabrication time and cost of these photoanodes.

A much cheaper approach is to engineer the chemical composition of the electrolyte by including specific species that could slow down the degradation of the metal-coated Si photoelectrode. As an example, Kenney et al. [19] observed that the 2 nm Ni/SiO<sub>x</sub>/n-Si photoanodes (which showed an onset potential of ~1.07 V vs. RHE and a stability of ~12 hours in KOH) exhibited an onset potential of ~1.205 V vs. RHE and a stability >80 hours when using an electrolyte made by mixing 1.9 g KOH with 0.65 g lithium hydroxide (LiOH) and 6 g of boric acid in 50 mL of water. Therefore, this species combination in the electrolyte resulted in an improved stability, although the activity remarkably decreased. Other works also observed that electrolyte engineering has non-negligible effects on the electrical performance of water splitting solar cells.[19,29-31] As an example, HER is much easier to occur in acid electrolytes, whereas OER is easier to occur in alkaline electrolytes. In various acid electrolytes, different types of anions and cations could exert a substantial influence on the solar-to-oxygen conversion efficiency. [30] In strong alkaline electrolytes with different cations, the long-term activity for PEC water oxidation relies on the cations, and lithium ions could help stabilize the photoelectrodes by decreasing the strength of O-H bonds.<sup>[31]</sup> However, in Ref. 31 the authors used this strategy to fabricate photoelectrodes made of metal oxides (not silicon).

In this work, we have developed a novel electrolyte for highly active and stable OER using 5 nm Ni coated n-type Si photoanodes. When immersed in 1 M KOH electrolytes (pH 14), these photoanodes exhibited the lowest  $V_{ON}$  (1.191 V vs. RHE) but the performance decayed after ~144

hours (at  $10 \text{ mA/cm}^2$  under the illumination of simulated 1 sun). The stability of the 5 nm Ni coated n-type Si photoanodes (under similar testing conditions) could be enhanced >264 hours by using an electrolyte consisting of 0.68 M K-borate and 0.31 M Li-borate (pH 9.5); however, this reduced the activity of the devices (i.e.  $V_{ON}$  increased to 1.473 V vs. RHE). These two types of electrolytes were used before in Refs. 5, 6, 9, 10, 16, 17, 19-21, 24, 25, 27, 31, 32. The novel electrolyte we have developed here consisted of 0.68 M KOH and 0.31 M LiOH (pH 12.5), and resulted in a competitive  $V_{ON}$  of 1.254 V vs. RHE and a stability of >264 hours. This novel KOH + LiOH electrolyte presents the best activity/stability compromise among all tests, and is a promising candidate electrolyte for future silicon-based photoanodes for PEC water splitting devices.

#### Results and discussion

The 5 nm Ni/SiO<sub>X</sub>/n-Si/Ti photoanodes were tested in the three different kinds of electrolytes, namely pH 14 (KOH), pH 12.5 (the mixed solution of KOH and LiOH), and pH 9.5 (the mixed solution of KOH, LiOH and H<sub>3</sub>BO<sub>3</sub>), by collecting CVs in the dark and under 1 sun illumination (see Figure 1a, 1b and 1c). In each electrolyte, 3-5 samples were measured showing high reproducibility, and Figure 1 presents the typical PEC performance of 5 nm Ni/SiO<sub>X</sub>/n-Si/Ti photoanodes measured in different electrolytes. The dashed lines stand for the first CV measurements with iR compensation. After different short-time (<10 hours) potential vs. time (P-t) tests under a constant density of 10 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>, <sup>[22]</sup> another CV was collected, which is showed in Figure 1a, 1b and 1c as a solid line (activated). The 5 nm Ni/SiO<sub>X</sub>/n-Si/Ti photoanode measured at pH 14 show lowest onset potential, 0.039 V more cathodic than the thermal dynamic potential for water oxidation, and it has achieved the saturation current (~22.0 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>) at the potential of 1.371 V vs. RHE (see Figure 1a). The 5 nm Ni/SiO<sub>X</sub>/n-Si/Ti measured at pH 9.5 with Li ions electrolyte shows an overpotential of 0.243 V. At pH 12.5, the onset potential for water oxidation of the 5 nm Ni/SiO<sub>X</sub>/n-Si/Ti photoanode is 1.254 V vs. RHE, that is, an overpotential of 0.024 V. And the corresponding potentials obtaining the saturation current are ~2.155 V vs. RHE and 1.533 V vs.

RHE, respectively. These results indicate that the activity of the photoanode at pH 12.5 is much better than that at pH 9.5. For the saturated current density, there is no obvious difference among the measurements in three different electrolytes, which is more related to light absorption of the photoanode. On the other hand, the stability of the photoanodes in different alkaline electrolytes has also been analyzed at a constant current density of 10 mA/cm² under 1 sun illumination. As shown in Figure 1d, in order to obtain the constant current density of 10 mA/cm², the 5 nm Ni/SiO<sub>X</sub>/n-Si/Ti photoanode tested at pH 14 (blue curve) initially needed (~1.860 V vs. RHE), but after 141 h this voltage increased up to 4 V, which means that the sample starts to decay. In pH 9.5 (red curve in Figure 1d) and pH 12.5 electrolytes with Li ions (green curve in Figure 1d), the photoanodes still show stable potential even after 264 h PEC tests, which is related to the slower corrosion. Considering both the activity and stability of the photoanodes in these three kinds of alkaline electrolytes, the photoanodes show the best OER performance in the mixture of KOH and LiOH electrolyte (pH 12.5).

To further understand the effects of pH value and Li ions on the stability of 5 nm Ni based n-Si photoanode, another type of pH 9.5 electrolyte (1 M K-borate) was prepared and used for PEC characterization. As shown in **Figure S1**a†, the photoanode tested in 1 M K-borate shows an onset potential of 1.453 V vs. RHE for water oxidation, similar to the result in pH 9.5 with Li ions electrolyte. Besides, in 1 M K-borate, the photoanode just shows stability in 80 h (Figure S1b†), which is much less stable than the measurement in 0.68 M K-borate and 0.1 M Li-borate electrolyte (> 264 h). These results demonstrated that the influence of pH value is much lower than that of Li ions.

To identify the reason why the activation takes place, XPS characterization was performed to analyze the chemical composition of fresh sample, the samples after 144 h PEC tests at pH 9.5 with Li ions and pH 12.5, and the one measured at pH 14 for 174 h. For fresh sample, due to thick 5 nm Ni layer on the surface, black trace in **Figure 2**a showed weak signal for Si 2p spectrum. The peaks of O 1s in Figure 2b (black trace) at 531.3 eV and 529.3 eV should be related to the oxygen

on the surface<sup>21</sup> and the formation of few NiO<sub>X</sub> in the air (respectively). After PEC tests, the two peaks at 852.4 eV and 869.6 eV (black trace in Figure 2c) —which may be related to the 2p<sup>3/2</sup> and 2p<sup>1/2</sup> binding energies of Ni<sup>0</sup> metal on the surface of fresh sample—disappeared, and another two peaks at 855.4 eV and 872.9 eV (green and blue traces in Figure 2c) appeared, indicating the formation of nickel oxide.<sup>[20,21]</sup> The activation process may be produced by the catalytic nickel oxide formed by the Ni oxidation, which could act as a p-type hole conducting layer contributing to the charge separation and transportation of holes toward the surface of the photoanodes. Compared to the fresh samples, the strengthened peak of O 1s at 529.5 eV (red trace in Figure 2b) after 144 h tests in 0.68 M K-borate and 0.31 M Li-borate electrolyte (pH 9.5) may be attributed to the formation of LiO<sub>X</sub>, as indicated by the obvious peak of Li 1s at 55.6 eV (red trace in Figure 2d). Furthermore, after 144 h PEC tests at pH 12.5, XPS analyses show two small peaks of Li 1s at 55.4 eV and 54.0 eV, as shown with green curve in Figure 2d, indicating the presence of lithium oxide or lithium hydroxide. These demonstrate that Li penetrates into the Ni layer and improve the stability of the photoanodes for PEC water splitting, which makes the photoanodes able to split water after 264 h.

To understand the morphology changes of the photoanodes after PEC tests at different alkaline electrolytes, SEM and AFM analyses were collected on the surface of the tested photoanodes. As a reference, Figure 3a and 3e show SEM and AFM images of fresh 5 nm Ni/SiO<sub>X</sub>/n-Si/Ti photoanode, which is very flat with a surface roughness of 0.35 nm. After 144 h PEC tests in 0.68 M K-borate and 0.31 M Li-borate (pH 9.5), the surface is rich of small particles (see Figure 3b and 3f), and the surface roughness of the photoanode increased from the initial value (0.350 nm) to 11.8 nm. The increase of surface roughness does not degrade the performance of the photoanode for PEC water splitting (red trace in Figure 1d). The peak of Ni 2p in XPS spectrum (red trace in Figure 2c and Figure S2†) after 144 h PEC tests probably is related to the formation of many particles on the surface, which can hide the Ni signal from being detected by XPS. However, after 174 h PEC tests at pH 14, large amounts of big holes can be observed on the surface of the

photoanodes by SEM and AFM characterizations, as shown in Figure 3d and 3h, which exhibit a surface roughness increase up to 66.0 nm, demonstrating that the Ni coating is severely etched. This is in agreement with the observation of two obvious peaks of Si 2p at binding energy of 97.5 eV and 101.3 eV in Figure 2a. The first peak at 97.5 eV is related to the presence of Si and the second one at 101.3 eV is related to the presence of silicon oxide, indicating the severe corrosion of the Ni layer at pH 14.

Interestingly, compared to the morphology of the photoanodes tested at pH 9.5 with Li ions, the surface of the photoanodes is rougher due to the formation of some big particles after 144 h PEC tests at pH 12.5, as observed in Figure 3c and 3g. Although the SEM image also showed few small pinholes, the long-time P-t tests shown in Figure 1d (green trace) was still stable, indicating that a few pinholes on the surface did not impact the total ability of the photoanode to split water in this electrolyte.

#### Conclusion

In conclusion, the influence of different alkaline electrolytes on the performance of 5 nm Ni based n-Si photoanodes for PEC water splitting devices has been analyzed. In terms of the activity, the onset potential of the photoanodes for water oxidation shows the trend of  $V_{ON,\,pH\,14} < V_{ON,\,pH\,12.5} < V_{ON,\,pH\,9.5}$ . The photoanodes at pH 9.5 with Li ions and pH 12.5 need an overpotential of 0.243 V and 0.024 V for water splitting (respectively), while the onset potential of the photoanode at pH 14 shows to be only 0.039 V more cathodic than the thermal dynamic potential for water oxidation. However, under the long-time PEC test, the photoanodes showed much more stable at pH 9.5 and pH 12.5 (both with Li ions) than at pH 14, mainly due to the presence of lithium ions in the electrolytes, and they still stay stable potential after 264 h P-t tests under the constant current density of 10 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>. Considering both the activity and stability, it is worth emphasizing that the 5 nm Ni coated n-Si photoanodes show the best OER performance at pH 12.5 electrolyte. Overall, tuning the chemical composition of the electrolyte is an inexpensive and effective method to

improve the performance of nickel-coated n-Si photoanodes for PEC water splitting devices. Future works should explore it this approach may be also useful to improve the performance of other metal-coated photoelectrodes for water splitting, not only for OER but also for HER.

### **Experimental Section**

Fabrication of electrodes. As-received phosphous-doped (100) n-type silicon wafers (from Prolog Semicor Ltd.) with a resistivity of 0.3-0.5  $\Omega$ ·cm and ~1 nm native silicon oxide (SiO<sub>X</sub>) were cleaned in acetone (first) and alcohol (second) for 10 min with sonication (power: 40 W), and dried with a nitrogen gun. After that, a 5 nm nickel layer was deposited on the polished surface of the n-Si wafer by AJA sputtering (from Stanford Nanofabrication Facility). In order to form an ohmic contact, a 30 nm titanium layer was also deposited on the back side of the wafers with the deposition rate of ~ 0.28 Å/s under the voltage of 8 kV by using electron beam evaporator (Kurt J. Lesker, model PVD75).

PEC characterization in different electrolytes. The photoanodes were tested in a teflon box containing the electrolyte. This box had two apertures facing each other, one with an area of 0.50 cm² to fix the photoanode and another one a bit larger to fix a glass through which light could be driven into the system. The voltages applied and currents generated were registered using a potentiostat (CHI 660E from CH Instruments, Inc.) connected to three electrodes: i) the prepared 5 nm Ni/SiO<sub>X</sub>/n-Si/30 nm Ti photoanodes, ii) a saturated calomel electrode (SCE, saturated KCl) as reference electrode, and iii) a solid Pt wire as counter electrode. The back side of the photoanodes was connected to the potentiostat using copper tape, and one rubber ring was used between the sample and the container to seal and avoid the leakage of the electrolytes.

We prepared electrolytes with three different acidities: i) pH 14 electrolyte, which consisted of 1 M potassium hydroxide (KOH); this was prepared by dissolving 5.6 g KOH in 100 mL deionized water; ii) pH 12.5 electrolyte, which consisted of 0.68 M KOH and 0.31 M lithium hydroxide monohydrate (LiOH·H<sub>2</sub>O); this was prepared by mixing 3.8 g KOH and 1.3 g LiOH·H<sub>2</sub>O

dissolved in 100 mL deionized water; and iii) pH 9.5 electrolyte, which consisted of 0.68 M Kborate and 0.31 M Li-borate; this was prepared by mixing 3.8 g KOH, 1.3 g LiOH·H<sub>2</sub>O and 12 g boric acid (H<sub>3</sub>BO<sub>3</sub>) in 100 mL deionized water. In order to compare with 0.68 M K-borate and 0.31 M Li-borate electrolyte, as a reference, another pH 9.5 (1 M K-borate) made of 5.6 g KOH and 12 g H<sub>3</sub>BO<sub>3</sub> dissolved in 100 mL deionized water. The pH of each electrolyte was measured using a standard meter from Mettler-Toledo Instruments (model FE20). All the chemicals were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. During the experiments, cyclic voltammetry (CV) with iR compensation and multi-current steps (ISTEP) without iR compensation were measured on the photoanodes under a light density of ~100 mW/cm<sup>2</sup> (1 sun). The illumination was provided by a 150 W Xenon lamp, and the illuminated density was calibrated by an optical power meter (model 1918-R), both from Newport Corporation. During the measurements, to avoid the formation of crystals we refilled the teflon box with more electrolyte every 12 hours, and completely exchanged the electrolyte every 48 hours. In this work, the onset potential is defined as the potential where the CV shows a current density of 3 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>. To compare the activity of the photoanodes measured at different pH electrolyte, the applied potential versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and related overpotential (V<sub>over</sub>) for water oxidation can be calculated by the following equation (1) and (2), respectively:

$$V (RHE) = V (SCE) + 0.244 V + 0.059 * pH$$
 Equation (1)

$$V_{\text{over}}$$
 (NHE) =  $V_{\text{ON}}$  (SCE) + 0.244 V – (1.23 V – 0.059 \* pH) Equation (2)

Materials characterization. After the electrical tests, the surface of the photoanodes was characterized at the micro and nano scales to detect the impact of different pH electrolytes. The morphological changes of the samples before and after PEC tests were characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Zeiss SUPRA55) and atomic force microscopy (AFM, Veeco Multimode V) in tapping mode with NanoWorld Pointprobe tips (model NCH). Besides, the chemical composition of the samples was characterized using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy

(XPS) with the X-ray source of mono-chromatic Al K $\alpha$  (model Shimadzu KRATOS AXIS Ultra DLD Scanning XPS Microprobe).

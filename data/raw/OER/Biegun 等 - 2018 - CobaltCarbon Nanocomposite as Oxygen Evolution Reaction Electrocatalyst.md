#### Abstract

Electrocatalysts based on cobalt are promising electrocatalysts for water electrolysis reaction. In this work, We reported catalyst composed of cobalt nanoparticles embeded in carbon lattice through synthesis with a cationic polymer (PEI) and carbonization process at three temperatures (800, 900 and 1000 °C). Material achieved at 1000 °C showed the highest activity towards Oxygen Evolution Reaction in an alkaline medium (1 M KOH). Moreover, the OER overpotential at 10 mA · cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> value, equal to 296 mV , was lower than for commercial catalyst RuO2. Further, the material also exhibited very good stability at the long-term stability test at 10 mA · cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> .

# 1 Introduction

With more and more environment concern, developing clean energy technologies is of critical importance.[1] Hydrogen has been considered as one of the best energy source to replace fossil fuels. Splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen is considered as one of the most promising strategies for generating hydrogen.[2]

Water electrolysis reaction is one of the oldest electrochemical process, discovered in 1800 by William Nicholson and Anthony Carlisle.[3] Today significance of this method has grown caused by the demands of the high purity, cost-effective and environmentally friendly hydrogen sources.[4]

The Oxygen Evolution Reaction together with Hydrogen Evolution Reaction compose water electrolysis reaction. The efficiency of each of these influences the performance of the whole process. The properly used catalyst could achieve that objective. The requirement for such as material is: high electrocatalytic activity, long-term electrochemical stability, low cost and non-toxic.[5, 6]

Classical, precious metal like Iridium, Ruthenium and their oxides RuO2, IrO<sup>2</sup> are considered as best catalyst for water oxidation.[7, 8] However, they are expensive and rare materials. Few kind of non-noble, abundant metal potential OER catalysts like Ni, Fe, Co, Cu are reported in the literature.[9, 10, 11,

12] Moreover, frequently compounds of this metals group (Ni, Fe, Co, Cu) like oxides, phosphates, sulfates are reported.[13, 14] Structures like nanowires, nanoarrays composed of different metals and its compounds are combined to achieve high catalytic performance.[15, 16, 17, 18]

Among this group cobalt-carbon structures have appeared as a promising asset for processing electrocatalytic water oxidation in alkaline medium.[19, 20] Cobalt-based materials are now a very large part of the number of published articles on OER catalysts subject.[21, 9, 22]. Especially core-shell structures exhibit good activity as for OER/HER.[23, 24] Moreover, magnetic particles obtained as core/shell structures have improved chemical stability.[25] They are composed of metal nanoparticles covered with carbon layers where they secure metal particles from electrolyte influence. In this work nanostructure, Co in carbon lattice was synthesized with the participation of nitrogen content ionomer and silica. Synthesis method used to prepare presented in manuscript catalyst could be beneficial because of uses a simpler and less expensive cobalt precursor than most organic Co compounds. Moreover, amount of carbon incorporated to this material could be controlled by PEI concentration used for a synthesis.

# 2 Experimental

Synthesis of the electrocatalyst materials was performed by the following procedure, Fig.1 present diagram of the synthesis. (a) To 80 ml of the 25 % poliethylimine (PEI) solution in 50 % ethanol-water, a 3 g of the cobalt(II) nitrate Co(NO3)<sup>2</sup> was add and stirred for 4 h at RT. (b) In the next step 6 ml of the tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) and 2 ml of the 25 % ammonium hydroxide solution NH<sup>3</sup> · H2O was add and stirred for 12 h at room temperature (RT). (c) After solvent evaporation at 100 °C solid substance was obtained. (d) Then pulverized product was placed in the tube furnace and annealed in the argon atmosphere at 800, 900 and 1000 °C by 3 h, respectively. (e) Further, solid was treated by 3 M HF and HCl acid solutions to remove silica and remaining cobalt residues. After filtration (f) and vacuum drying (f) black comminuted material was collect, the obtained samples named CNx-Co(800 °C), CNx-Co(900 °C) and CNx-Co(1000 °C), respectively.

#### Electrode preparation

The working electrode was composed of the current collector and an active material. The current collector was a stainless steel mesh (SSM) (316L class, 450 US mesh) cut to circle shape (DIA=19 mm, 2.8 cm<sup>2</sup> ). Before preparation SSM was cleaned by ultrasonication in the following fluids: 10 % HCl solution, water and lastly in anhydrous acetone. Active material was obtained by dispersing 10 mg of the triturated catalyst in a 1 mL of the water:propan-2-ol (3:1vol) mixture with 50 µl addition of the Nafion 117. Proper working electrode was prepared by dropping 30 µl of the active material dispersion on the SSM. The mesh with the material was dried at 70 °C for 1h, then additionally annealed by heating in the argon atmosphere for 2 h at 200 °C. For comparison, electrode with commercial catalyst RuO<sup>2</sup> (Merck) was prepared by the same procedure. To proceed electrochemical test circle shaped electrodes were fixed in a special engineered tweezers (AISI 316L steel). Fig.2 show SEM images of the SSM with and without active material. Analysis of the images proof the appropriate electrode preparation, a material is clearly visible on the mesh structure.

### Electrochemical measurements

Electrochemical measurements were made in a 3-electrode glass cell at 22 °C connected to the BioLogic VMP-3 potentiostat/galvanostat electrochemical station. The potential of the working electrode was referred to the Saturated Calomel Electrode (SCE) which was calibrated to Reversible Hydrogen Electrode (RHE) level by directly measuring a potential of the Palladium-Hydrogen Electrode [?] (+50 mV vs RHE) in the same electrolyte. The relation between potentials SCE and RHE are calculated by the equation:

$$E_{RHE} = E_{SCE} + 0.214 + 0.059 \cdot pH \ [V] \tag{1}$$

where ERHE is potential vs RHE, ESCE is potential vs SCE. Pure a graphite rod, DIA=3 mm, was used as counter electrode. Preparation of the working electrodes was described in details in subsection 2. Oxygen Evolution Reaction was performed in alkaline electrolyte i.e. 1M KOH, which was deaerated before each test by argon (5.0 class) purging by 20 min.

# 3 Results and discussion

Materials after preparation were characterized by TEM imaging. In Fig. 3 presented are images of the (a) CNx-Co(800 °C), (b) CNx-Co(900 °C) and (c) CNx-Co(1000 °C) at the same magnification. Additionally, Fig 3 (d-f) respectively shows a cobalt particle size distribution graphs calculated from at least a 100 size measures taken from calibrated images in ImageJ software. Generally, a structure of the material is composed of the solid particles, cobalt crystals, distributed in overall carbon framework. Mainly metal particles are covered by carbon layer. Conclude from a size distributions rise of the temperature heat treatment have primarily influence to the size of the cobalt particles. Higher temperature caused particle size growth. At 800 °C particle size distribution is in range 6-17 nm, further at 900 °C appears a small fraction in range 100-175 nm and finally, at 1000 °C the size set is composed of particles in range 25-120 nm.

Fig. 4 present XRD spectra of achieved materials, CNx-Co(800, 900, 1000 °C). Strong peaks at 2Θ = 44, 52 and 76 deg are related to cobalt reflection (111), (200) and (220), they occurred in all three catalyst samples. Moreover, the carbon peak (002) at 2Θ ≈ 24 deg is a relatively weak and broad. Mean cobalt particle size was calculated from Scherrer equation:

$$D = \frac{0.9\lambda}{\beta \cos\Theta} \tag{2}$$

where λ is the wavelength of the X-rays from Cu anode source (0.15406 nm), Θ is the diffraction angle, and β is the line broadening at half of the maximum intensity. For CNx-Co(800 °C), CNx-Co(900 °C) and CNx-Co(1000 °C) mean particle size values are accordingly 7.4, 17.0 and 25.8 nm. The conclusion of the results of mean particle sizes calculated from XRD data is coherent with distribution particle analysis from TEM images. The rise of the processing temperature caused grown of the cobalt particles size.

Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) was used to determine the cobalt amount in attained materials. The analysis was performed in air flow at 100 ml·min Fig. 5 represent curves for CNx-Co(800, 900, 1000 °C) materials. Cobalt residual, after water content subtraction, is for CNx-Co(800 °C) and CNx-Co(900 °C) at a comparable level, approx 59-63 %. CNx-Co(1000 °C) sample cobalt contest is at 89 % level. This fact could be determined by carbon consumption in a carboreduction process between cobalt and a carbon template material which proceeds more intense at a higher temperature.[26]

#### 3.1 Electrochemical measurements

The material was examined by electrochemical measurement in a 3-electrode system. Linear Sweep Voltammetry (LSV) at 5 mV · s 1 scan rate was used to investigate Oxygen Evolution Reaction. Moreover, all data were corrected by an IR drop factor. Plots, current vs potential (RHE), for CNx-Co(800-1000 °C), RuO<sup>2</sup> and for clean electrode are presented in Fig. 6a. Fig. 6b shows Tafel plots calculated from interrelated LSV data for each material. Summarized set of data are presented in Table 1. LSV curves of all tested materials present typical shape of the oxygen evolution reaction electrocatalyst. The parameters like overpotential at 10 mA · cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> current density and a Tafel plot slope define the quality of the catalyst. Material with a lower value of the overpotential needs less energy to produce a unit amount of the oxygen or hydrogen. Its efficiency is as high as it has low overpotential and Tafel plot slope factor. In the case of the CNx-Co material, ηOER<sup>10</sup> and Tafel plot slope factor are the reverse proportional to the temperature of the material annealing. The CNx-Co(1000 °C) shows the best (ηOER<sup>10</sup> = 296 mV ) and the CNx-Co(800 °C) the worst (ηOER<sup>10</sup> = 307 mV ) behaviour as OER catalyst. Performance of the commercial catalyst, RuO2, is almost equal (ηOER<sup>10</sup> = 308 mV ) like the CNx-Co(800 °C) material. The catalyst-less electrode exhibits the lowest electroactivity, indicating that this type of current collector has minimal influence on the electrochemical catalyst tests.

Material with the highest performance, i.e. CNx-Co(1000 °C), was tested with a long time period OER under constant current conditions. Fig. 7 present chronopotentiometry plot of the OER with CNx-Co(1000 °C) catalyst, under 10 mA · cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> current density conducted for 24 h. Potential of the working electrode needed to sustain desired current density has slightly risen from a 1.527 V to 1.534 V vs RHE by time 10h stabilized at this level. This indicates good electrochemical stability of the material during work as OER catalyst in an alkaline electrolyte.

Table 2 present a comparison of some of the electrocatalyst materials contained cobalt compound published in the literature with material presented in this article.

# 4 Conclusion

Within this study cobalt, carbon nanocomposite electrocatalyst was achieved with respect to electrocatalytic activity considering the anodic oxygen evolution reaction in an alkaline water electrolysis process. Variable high-temperature treatment at 800, 900 and 1000 °C revealed influence at the nanoparticle size distribution and at the electrocatalytic activity toward OER. The highest temperature assured the best activity in a result material.

Mange Ram, Ayan Roy, and Krishna Kanta Haldar\*

This study delves into the synergistic electrochemical advantages of a niobium-doped molybdenum trioxide (MoO<sub>3</sub>) nanorods combined with a tantalum pentoxide (Ta<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>) catalyst to increase the efficiency of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In light of the increasing demand for sustainable energy solutions, the imperative to develop efficient electrocatalysts conducive to water splitting, a critical process in hydrogen production, becomes evident. This investigation involves the synthesis of a niobium-doped  $\text{MoO}_3/\text{Ta}_2\text{O}_5$  composite and comprehensively evaluating its structural, electrochemical, and catalytic properties through various spectroscopic and electrochemical techniques. These findings highlight that incorporating niobium markedly enhances the

electronic conductivity and availability of active sites within the catalyst, resulting in improved OER performance. Comparative analyses against conventional electrocatalysts underscore that the 8% niobium-doped  $\text{MoO}_3/\text{Ta}_2\text{O}_5$  composite demonstrates lower overpotentials (238 mV) and higher current densities, indicating its significant potential for practical applications. Furthermore, the robust metal–support interactions enabled by the  $\text{Ta}_2\text{O}_5$  support stabilize the active phase and increase the catalyst's overall durability. This work yields valuable insights into the mechanisms of OER catalysis involving niobium-doped metal oxides, thereby underscoring the potential of such innovative catalyst designs in advancing hydrogen production technologies.

### 1. Introduction

The depletion of nonrenewable fossil fuels, such as petroleum, coal, and natural gas, underscores the pressing necessity for sustainable, affordable, and renewable energy sources to meet contemporary and future energy demands.[1] Rechargeable metal-air batteries, electrochemical catalysts, and solar energy conversion technologies facilitate a transition toward a hydrogen-based economy.[2] Among these advanced technologies, electrochemical catalysis has gained significant interest from the scientific community, particularly in electrochemical water splitting, which presents a promising pathway for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). These reactions hold the potential for energy production and contribute to heat generation and climate change mitigation.[3] The HER, represented by the equation  $2H^+(aq) + 2e^- \rightarrow H2(q)$ , occurs at the cathode, whereas the OER, denoted by  $2H_2O(I) \rightarrow O_2(g) + 4H^+(aq) + 4e^-$ , takes place at the anode during the electrocatalytic water splitting process described by  $2H_2O \rightarrow O_2 + 2H_2$ .

electrocatalysts, such as RuO<sub>2</sub>, IrO<sub>2</sub>, and Pt/C, have demonstrated substantial efficacy in OER and HER electrocatalysis.<sup>[9]</sup> However, their high overpotentials, exorbitant prices, susceptibility to poisoning, and limited availability significantly impede their large-scale and long-term application in green energy technologies. Consequently, there is an urgent need to develop cost-effective and earth-abundant electrocatalysts that achieve optimal reaction rates for both the OER and HER.<sup>[10–16]</sup>

Numerous initiatives have focused on creating economical and efficient alternatives that do not rely on PGMs. Over the past decade, substantial research efforts have concentrated on designing new, PGM-free electrocatalysts. [7,17-20] The guest for commercially viable, earth-abundant catalysts capable of facilitating these reactions across a wide pH range holds great promise for future advancements. Owing to their cost-effectiveness and compatibility with various pH values, transition metal compounds—including oxides, nitrides, phosphides, sulfides, and selenides—have emerged as preferable candidates for the OER.[21,22] Addressing the challenges related to the large-scale development of regenerative fuel cells requires the creation of highly stable, reversible air electrodes that can efficiently catalyze the OER. Recent studies have explored the use of transition metal oxides for activating either the HER or the OER in alkaline environments, with some materials being evaluated for bifunctional air electrode applications. Spinel-type materials such as M<sub>x</sub>M<sup>'</sup><sub>3-x</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, where M signifies metals such as Ni, Mn, Co, Cu, Zn, and Fe and where M' denotes Co or Mn, have recently attracted significant attention. Despite their potential, concerns regarding durability and catalytic activity remain; transition metal-based compounds often lose surface area and active sites due to aggregation. Consequently, research on molybdenum oxide and its

derivatives has focused predominantly on their catalytic behavior specific to the OER, with few studies focusing on their utility in modifying OER phenomena.[23–26]

Notably, the robust interaction between nonnoble metal oxides and noble metal oxide nanoparticles presents a promising approach for maximizing the efficient use of noble metals. However, to date, minimal research has been directed toward establishing molybdenum oxides and their derivatives as effective OER catalysts. This indicates a gap in our understanding of the efficacy of molybdenum oxides in catalyzing OER processes.[21,27,28] Additionally, the strong metal–support interactions (SMSI) between metals and Ta2O5 have the capacity to influence metal oxidation states and stabilize nanoparticles, potentially enhancing the performance and longevity of electrocatalysts. Recent investigations have investigated the use of Ta2O5 in conjunction with other metals to form mixed metal oxides for OER catalysis. Although amorphous Ta2O5 films have been evaluated as OER catalysts and their activity has been correlated with crystallinity, little exploration has been conducted regarding their interaction with Mo and the stability of the supported catalyst in practical applications such as microelectrode arrays.[29–31]

In previous studies, the synthesis of mesoporous Ta2O5 with a remarkably high specific surface area of 100 m2 g-<sup>1</sup> has been achieved, yielding enhanced electron-conducting networks that substantially improve electrical conductivity compared with Ta2O5-supported catalysts.[32,33] In the context of mixed metal oxides, enhancements such as increased Brunauer–Emmett– Teller surface area, improved charge transfer kinetics, and the presence of various hydroxo species that transition into oxo species collectively contribute to the enhanced electrochemical properties of the resulting electrocatalysts.[34] Furthermore, studies by Pfeifer et al. indicate that high surface areas, along with highly oxidative species such as O2 2 and O-1 , favor the activity of iridium-based OER catalysts, promoting oxygen evolution in electrolytic cells.[35] The emergence of noble metal-rich regions on nonnoble metal oxides plays a significant role in enhancing material conductivity.[36] The continuously evolving landscape of research surrounding molybdenum oxides and their derivatives remains of high interest within the field of electrochemistry, particularly as the search for efficient and sustainable materials for energy conversion and storage continues.[37–41]

Doping MoO3 with niobium has been shown to modify its electronic structure and improve conductivity, while the incorporation of Ta2O5 contributes to structural stability and increased surface area. These modifications facilitate the adsorption of reactants, thereby accelerating the reaction kinetics involved in the OER process. The synergistic interaction between niobium-doped MoO3 and Ta2O5 not only enhances the electrochemical properties but also leads to improved reactivity under operational conditions.[42–44] This study aims to systematically investigate the combined electrochemical benefits of a niobium-doped MoO3/Ta2O5 catalyst. By exploring its structural, electrochemical, and functional characteristics, we seek to provide insights into the fundamental mechanisms by which this catalyst enhances OER efficiency. The findings from this research could contribute to developing advanced catalytic materials that address the growing energy crisis through effective and sustainable watersplitting technologies.

#### 2.1. Instrumentations

#### 2.1.1. X-ray Diffraction

Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) was performed on a PANalytical Empyrean instrument using Cu Κα radiation (λ = 1.5406) in the 2θ range from 5° to 90° with a step size of 0.02626 at an acceleration voltage of 45 kV. The obtained PXRD patterns of the samples were refined using the Rietveld refinement method and Fullprof Suite software.

The Raman spectroscopic phonon modes were evaluated under ambient conditions via 532 nm diode laser illumination with a Technos STR-500 micro-Raman spectrometer. A spectral resolution of 1 cm-<sup>1</sup> and a 10x acquisition were used with an integration time of 10 s for each acquisition Scheme 1.

## 3. Results and Discussion

## 3.1. PXRD Structural Study

A multifunctional niobium-doped MoO3/Ta2O5 catalyst was synthesized via hydrothermal methods followed by calcination at elevated temperatures. PXRD was employed to validate the formation of crystalline phases in the synthesized samples. The PXRD pattern of the MoO3 nanorods, as depicted in Figure S1, Supporting Information, displayed prominent characteristic peaks at 12.77, 23.33, 25.70, 27.30, 38.98, 39.66, 58.83, and 67.57°, which correspond to the (020), (110), (040), (021), (060), (150), (081), and (0 10 0) planes, respectively. These peaks concurred with the standard reference bar of the ICDD card: 00-005-0508 and the space group Pbnm, confirming the formation of highly crystalline α-MoO3 with an orthorhombic crystal structure. Similarly, the PXRD pattern of Ta2O5 exhibited discernible diffraction peaks at 2θ values of 22.84, 28.28, 28.78, 36.66, 37.05, 46.66, 49.75, 50.68, 55.41, 55.46, 55.75, and 56.27°, corresponding to the (001), (1 11 0), (200), (1 11 1), (201), (002),

(0 22 0), (3 11 0), (0 22 1), (1 11 2), (202), and (3 11 1) planes, respectively, of the orthorhombic β-phase, characteristic of the P21212 space group (ICDD card: 00-025-0922). PXRD analysis of the MoO<sub>3</sub> and Ta<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> composite confirmed the presence of reflections from the lattice planes of both the orthorhombic MoO<sub>3</sub> and Ta<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> phases without any indication of an impurity phase, thus confirming the formation of a highly crystalline composite structure. Furthermore, the PXRD patterns of the Nb-doped samples (MTN-1, MTN-3, MTN-5, MTN-8, and MTN-10) exhibited negligible changes compared with those of the MT composite, except for the most intense (040) plane of the MoO<sub>3</sub> phase, which exhibited a downshift toward lower diffraction angles with increasing loading of Nb atoms, as elucidated in Figure 1b. Subsequent Rietveld refinement profile fitting of the PXRD patterns and the corresponding refined plots indicate close agreement with the experimental data, as evidenced by the lower values of conventional reliability R factors presented in Table S1, Supporting Information. Additionally, the structural unit cell parameters and their variations are reported in Table S1, Supporting Information. As calculated via the Scherrer equation, the crystallite sizes of MoO<sub>3</sub> and Ta<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> are 38 nm and 51 nm, respectively.[45]

# 3.2. Raman Spectroscopy

Raman spectroscopy has been employed to investigate the phase purity and interactions among different vibrational modes of a lattice, particularly those influenced by the motion of lighter atoms. According to space group theory, the Pbnm space group corresponding to  $\alpha\text{-MoO}_3$  features a total of 45 zone center optical phonon modes at the Brillouin zone's  $\tau\text{-point}$  (at k=0). Among these modes, 24 are Raman active, 17 are infrared active, and 4 are active according to both Raman and infrared spectroscopy. The irreducible representation can be expressed for the Raman active modes as follows:  $\Gamma_{\text{Raman}} = 8\text{Ag} + 8\text{B1g} + 4\text{B2g} + 4\text{B3g}$ . The Raman shifts (in cm $^{-1}$ ) of the Raman active modes for pristine MoO $_3$  are depicted in Figure 2a, displaying numerous Raman modes at 114 (B3g), 128 (B1g), 158 (Ag), 196 (B3g), 217 (Ag),

244 (B1g), 283 (B3g), 291 (B1g), 337 (Ag), 377 (Ag), 482 (Ag), and 666 (B1g) cm<sup>-1</sup>, along with pronounced peaks at 818 (Ag) and 995 (Ag) cm<sup>-1,[46]</sup> The modes observed in the range of 600-1000 cm<sup>-1</sup> are attributable to the stretching of the MoO<sub>6</sub> octahedra, whereas those in the 100-500 cm<sup>-1</sup> range arise from the bending of the MoO<sub>6</sub> octahedra, as well as the scissoring, wagging, twisting, and translational/rotational motions of the Mo-O bonds within the MoO<sub>4</sub> rigid chains. Notably, the modes at 666 and 819 cm<sup>-1</sup> correspond to the asymmetric stretching of triply coordinated edge-sharing oxygen (Mo<sub>3</sub>-O) and the symmetric stretching of doubly coordinated oxygen in the Mo-O-Mo bridge. [47] The fingerprint mode at 995 cm<sup>-1</sup> is attributed to the symmetric stretching of the terminal molybdenum-oxygen (Mo=O) double bond, and its narrow peak indicates the nonpolar nature of α-MoO<sub>3</sub>. Additionally, the mode at 114 cm<sup>-1</sup> represents the lattice mode, whereas the peak at 156 cm<sup>-1</sup> is attributed to the translational mode of the MoO<sub>4</sub> rigid chain. The peak at 217 cm<sup>-1</sup> is identified as the Rc mode, and the peaks at 196 and 244 cm<sup>-1</sup> are both associated with the twisting mode of O=Mo=O. The doublet peak at 283 and 291 cm<sup>-1</sup> is ascribed to the wagging motions of the terminal oxygen atoms, whereas the peaks at 482, 377, and 337 cm<sup>-1</sup> correspond to the O-Mo-O symmetric bending, O—Mo—O scissoring, and O—Mo—O bending modes, respectively. In contrast, the Raman spectra of Ta<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> exhibit distinctive peaks at 129, 197, 250, 334, 482, 571, 627, 708, 845, and 899 cm<sup>-1</sup>, which are reflective of the crystalline orthorhombic  $\beta$  phase and correspond to the stretching and bending vibrations of the Ta-O-Ta bonds (internal skeletal modes) and O-Ta-O bonds (terminal modes). The modes within the 400-800 cm<sup>-1</sup> range are associated with the torsional and stretching motions of triply coordinated oxygen atoms in TaO<sub>6</sub> octahedra, whereas modes above 800 cm<sup>-1</sup> pertain to the movements of doubly coordinated oxygen atoms. Furthermore, modes below 400 cm<sup>-1</sup> result from the O-Ta-O bending vibrations of TaO<sub>6</sub> octahedra and Ta—Ta vibrations. [45,48] Specifically, the peak at 482 cm<sup>-1</sup> is ascribed to O—Ta—O symmetric stretching, whereas the broad feature composed of triple split peaks in the range of 500-800 cm<sup>-1</sup> signifies the signature octahedral coordination of TaO<sub>6</sub>, indicating a crystalline nature in

comparison with that of amorphous structures.[49] The peak at 845 cm-<sup>1</sup> corresponds to the bipyramidal TaO7 with pentagonal coordination. For the composite structures under investigation, only the modes related to the MoO3 nanorods appear prominently due to their higher Raman sensitivity, attributed to their increased crystalline nature relative to Ta2O5, is illustrated in Figure 2b. Moreover, in the composite structures, the Raman mode at 666 cm-<sup>1</sup> from MoO3 progressively decreases in intensity, whereas shoulder features emerge above 700 cm-1 , suggesting the presence of Ta2O5, as evidenced in the enlarged graph in Figure 2c.

## 3.3. X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy Compositional Study

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was conducted to elucidate the valence state and composition of the synthesized niobium-doped composite structures. The full-scan survey spectra for all the MTN composites are presented in Figure S2, Supporting Information, confirming the presence of molybdenum (Mo), tantalum (Ta), niobium (Nb), and oxygen (O), which further confirmed the successful formation of the Nb-doped MoO3/Ta2O5 composite structure. To enhance accuracy, a Shirley function was utilized for background correction, whereas a pseudo-Voigt line-shape fitting method was applied to analyze the high-resolution (HR) XPS spectra of Mo 3d, Ta 4f, Nb 3d, and O 1s, with the C 1s peak from adventitious contamination (284.8 eV) employed for calibrating binding energies. The fitted Mo 3d HR XPS spectra for all the composites, as depicted in Figure 3a, reveal four distinct peaks. Notably, the peaks at 235.39 and 232.26 eV in the MTN-1 sample correspond to Mo 3d3/2 (high-binding energy component) and Mo 3d5/2 (lowbinding energy component), which are attributed to Mo6<sup>þ</sup> ion species. Additionally, two weaker peaks at 234.35 eV (Mo 3d3/2) and 231.06 eV (Mo 3d5/2) indicate a minor amount of Mo5<sup>þ</sup> ion species.[50] In Figure 3b, the HRXPS spectra of Ta 4f for the

composite structures exhibit two peaks at 25.34 and 27.21 eV, which are assigned to the Ta 4f7/2 and Ta 4f5/2 orbitals, respectively, indicating the presence of Ta5<sup>þ</sup> ion species in titanium oxide.[33] Furthermore, the HRXPS spectra for Nb 3d, shown in Figure 3c, display two peaks at 209.51 and 206.77 eV, corresponding to the Nb 3d3/2 and Nb 3d5/2 orbitals, respectively. The observed spin–orbital splitting energy difference of 2.74 eV suggests that the valence of niobium is þ5 within the composite structure.[51,52] The O 1 s HRXPS spectra reveal two fitted peaks at 530.10 and 531.85 eV, related to lattice oxygen corresponding to Mo-O/Ta-O and chemisorbed oxygen species, such as OHor water molecules.[53] Additionally, as indicated in Table S2, Supporting Information, the peak positions for the other composite structures began to shift toward higher binding energies with increased Nb loading, suggesting synergistic electronic interactions between the MoO3 and Ta2O5 structures. The Nb 3 d spectra exhibited a smoother profile with increased intensity as the amount of Nb atoms increased. Notably, the proportion of Mo5<sup>þ</sup> ionic species was minimal, 1.54%, compared with the predominant Mo6<sup>þ</sup> species in MTN-1, and exhibited only a slight increase with the addition of Nb atoms in the other composites.

#### 3.4. Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy

Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) analysis was performed to investigate the morphological characteristics of all the samples. The MT complex, formed after the calcination of MoO3 and Ta2O5 at 300 °C for 3 h, exhibited a distinct nanorod morphology. Energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and elemental mapping, illustrated in Figure S3a-c, confirmed the presence of various elements associated with MoO3. The FE-SEM images of Ta2O5 reveal a cluster-like morphology displayed Figure S4d-f, with their EDS spectra indicating the presence of molybdenum (Mo), tantalum (Ta), and oxygen (O) within the sample, as shown in Figure S5, Supporting Information. Furthermore, the FE-SEM images show that the MoO3 nanorods are embedded within the Ta2O5 nanoclusters at various magnifications, as depicted in Figure 4a–d. EDS analysis and elemental mapping of the MT composite, as shown in Figure 4e–f, confirmed the elemental distributions of molybdenum (Mo), tantalum (Ta), and oxygen (O), confirming the successful incorporation of MoO3 and Ta2O5 within the composite structure and elemental mapping are shown in figure S5, Supporting Information.[33,54]

## 3.5. Transmission Electron Microscopy

The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images presented in Figure 5 reveal rod-shaped MT composites, illustrating that Ta2O5 particles have strongly adhered to both the edges and surfaces of the MoO3 nanorods. Notably, Figure 5c highlights the formation of a robust interfacial junction between MoO3 and Ta2O5, revealing the presence of a heterostructure. Additionally, highresolution TEM (HRTEM) images, depicted in Figure 5e,j, confirm the concurrent existence of crystalline facets of MoO3 and Ta2O5, characterized by distinct heterojunctions. The HRTEM images further indicate that the lattice spacing of MoO3 is 6.91 Å, which is consistent with the (200) crystallographic plane of MoO3. In contrast, the observed lattice fringe of 3.88 Å corresponds to the (001) crystallographic plane of Ta2O5. Thus, the TEM investigations effectively confirmed the successful attachment of Ta2O5 particles onto the surface of MoO3.

The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns, illustrated in Figure 6, confirm the crystalline nature of the MoO3/ Ta2O5 (MT) composite. Several planes designated for both MoO3 and Ta2O5 are marked within the SAED pattern. Specifically, the SAED pattern of the composite displays bright spots forming a circular arrangement that corresponds to the (111), (400), and (101) planes of MoO3 alongside the (112) and (011) planes of Ta2O5. The

interplanar distances corresponding to the specified planes are 2.64, 3.45, and 3.80 Å for MoO3 and 1.65 Å and 3.15 Å for Ta2O5, as depicted in Figure 6a,b. This investigation provides additional evidence of the crystalline properties of the composite material.

#### 3.6. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy

Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analysis was conducted on MoO3 and Ta2O5 to examine the bonding characteristics of the nanorodbased composite elucidated in Figure 7. The spectra of the composite (MT) and its derivatives reveal a prominent peak at 995.03 cm-1 , indicating the terminal Mo─O stretching vibration typical of orthorhombic MoO3. A distinct broad and sharp peak in the 1000–900 cm-<sup>1</sup> range is attributed to the molybdenyl bond (νs (M─O)) stretching vibration. Another significant peak at 858 cm corresponds to the oxygen stretching mode of the Mo─O─Mo bonds. In contrast, a broad vibration band at 564 cm-<sup>1</sup> is associated with oxygen atoms interacting with three metal atoms (ν(O─3Mo)) or oxygen atom bending vibrations linked to three metal atoms. For MoO3, high-frequency bands at 964.3 and 808.1 cm are ascribed to asymmetric (νas Mo─O(1)) and symmetric stretching (νs Mo─O3─Mo), respectively.[54–57] The band at 679.8 cm-<sup>1</sup> corresponds to the asymmetric stretching and bending of ν Mo─O(2)─Mo. The absorption bands between 600 and 800 cm-<sup>1</sup> are associated with Ta─O─Ta and Ta─O bonds, whereas the peak at 1100 cm-<sup>1</sup> is linked to the Ta─O terminal group.[8,25]

## 3.7. Electrochemical Activity

We investigated the electrochemical performance of the OER for niobium-doped MoO3/Ta2O5 (MTN) composite nanostructures at various doping percentages (1, 3, 5, 8, and 10%) and compared them to those of the pure composite and other counterparts in figure 8. The performance of the MTN-8 composite nanorods as anodes for the OER in a 1 M KOH medium was evaluated through linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) studies, with detailed experimental information provided in the Supporting Information. The LSV curve for the MTN-8 composite indicates that the overpotential required to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm-<sup>2</sup> is 238 mV, which is significantly lower than the values observed for its counterparts: MTN-5 (262 mV), MTN-3 (280 mV), MTN-1 (292 mV), MTN-10 (303 mV), MT (326 mV), MoO3 (331 mV), Ta2O5 (339 mV), and the benchmark IrO2 (350 mV), as shown in Figure 8a,b. Furthermore, the mass activity was calculated on the basis of the area of the nickel foam (0.5 cm 0.5 cm = 0.25 cm-2 ) and a mass loading of 0.7142 mg per 50 mL. The mass activity value for MTN-8 was found to be 85.06 A g-1 , which is the highest among all the counterparts: MTN-5 (55.66 A g-1 ), MTN-3 (46.90 A g-1 ), MTN-1 (42.70 A g-1 ), MTN-10 (42.35 A g-1 ), MT (41.65 A g-1 ), MoO3 (37.10 A g-1 ), Ta2O5 (33.25 A g-1 ), and bare Ni (21.35 A g-1 ) and surpasses the benchmark IrO2 (30.80 A g-1 presented in Figure 8i,j.

The OER kinetics were further analyzed through a Tafel slope assessment. The Tafel slope for the MTN-8 catalyst was determined to be 66 mV dec-1 , indicating exceptional OER activity compared with that of its counterparts: MTN-5 (90 mV dec-1 ), MTN-3 (107 mV dec-1 ), MTN-1 (121 mV dec-1 ), MTN-10 (129 mV dec-1 ), MT (141 mV dec-1 ), MoO3 (162 mV dec-1 ), Ta2O5 (171 mV dec-1 ), bare Ni foam (192 mV dec-1 ), and the benchmark IrO2 (75 mV dec-1 ), as illustrated in Figure 8c,d. Additionally, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed to gain insight into the remarkable catalytic activity of the MTN-8 catalyst for the OER, as shown in Figure 8e,f. Notably, MTN-8

demonstrated the lowest charge-transfer resistance of 2.89 Ω, in contrast to MTN-5 (3.21 Ω), MTN-3 (4.31 Ω), MTN-1 (6.20 Ω), MTN-10 (6.76 Ω), MT (3.64 Ω), MoO3 (4.09 Ω), Ta2O5 (10.84 Ω), and bare Ni foam (9.78 Ω), reflecting the rapid kinetic process of the MTN-8 catalyst for OER activity. The comprehensive electrochemical data

concerning OER activity for MTN-8, MTN-3, MTN-1, MTN-10, MT, MoO3, Ta2O5, and IrO2 are summarized in Table S1, Supporting Information. We conducted cyclic voltammetry (CV) to analyze

the double-layer capacitance ( $C_{\rm dl}$ ) and electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) of the catalyst. As shown in Table S3, Supporting Information, MTN-8 exhibited a double-layer capacitance of 20.97 mF cm<sup>-2</sup> and an ECSA of 524.25 cm<sup>-2</sup> (Figure 8g,h), surpassing the values obtained for all other catalysts. The CV curves enabled the calculation of both the anodic and cathodic double-layer charging currents ( $J_{\rm a}$  and  $J_{\rm c}$ , respectively) at a fixed potential of 0.3 V (vs Ag/AgCl). These values were plotted against the corresponding scan rates, as shown in Figure S6(i,ii), Supporting Information.

capacitance ( $C_{\rm cl}$ ). The CV curves enabled the calculation of both the anodic and cathodic double-layer charging currents ( $J_a$  and  $J_{cr}$ respectively) at a fixed potential of 0.3 V (vs Ag/AgCl). The calculated  $C_{\rm dl}$  for MTN-8 was 20.97 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>, corresponding to an ECSA of 524.25 cm<sup>-2</sup>. In comparison, the ECSA values of the other catalysts were significantly lower, including those of MTN-5 (391.12 cm<sup>-2</sup>), MTN-1 MTN-3  $(366.12 \text{ cm}^{-2}),$  $(363.62 \text{ cm}^{-2}),$ MTN-10  $(267.25 \text{ cm}^{-2})$ , MT  $(244.88 \text{ cm}^{-2})$ , and MoO<sub>3</sub>  $(90.38 \text{ cm}^{-2})$ , and those of the other catalysts were 146.75 and 150.75 cm<sup>-2</sup>, respectively, as presented in Table S3, Supporting Information.

Collectively, these electrochemical studies—including LSV, Tafel analysis, and EIS investigations—demonstrate that compared with the other synthesized catalysts, MTN-8 has superior electrochemical performance for the OER.[59-62] Additionally, we investigated the stability of MTN-8 via the chronoamperometry method at an overpotential of 238 mV for 30 h (Figure 9), which also showed very high durability with negligible loss of current density. Additionally, XRD (Figure S7, Supporting Information) and FE-SEM images (Figure S8, Supporting Information) of the MTN-8 catalyst after the chronoamperometry test reveal that no structural deformation occurs during OER performance.

The doped Nb influences the electronic structures of MoO<sub>3</sub>/ Ta<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> species, enhancing OER catalysis. The synergy between MoO<sub>3</sub> and Ta<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, enhanced by niobium (Nb) doping, results in the formation of more active sites for the OER. Nb atoms can occupy interstitial or substitutional positions in the lattice, which modifies the local atomic environment and creates new catalytic sites with a higher affinity for oxygen intermediates. Niobium

(Nb) doping in MoO<sub>3</sub> and Ta<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> alters the electronic band structure, which can reduce the bandgap energy. This reduction enhances the conductivity of the catalyst, facilitating electron transfer during the OER process. The presence of Nb can introduce new energy states near the Fermi level, which are beneficial for the adsorption and activation of oxygen species. Nb, being a transition metal, can donate extra electrons to the MoO<sub>3</sub>/Ta<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> matrix. This increases the density of charge carriers (electrons/ holes) in the material, which improves the catalytic efficiency by accelerating the rate of electron transfer during the OER. The introduction of Nb alters the adsorption energies of oxygencontaining intermediates (such as OH\*, O\*, and OOH\*) on the catalyst surface. This optimization reduces the energy barriers for these intermediates to form, facilitating the four-electron transfer process that characterizes the OER. Thus, the presence of Nb affects the reaction kinetics by lowering the activation energy of the rate-determining steps in the OER pathway. This can lead to faster reaction rates and improved overall efficiency of the OER process, resulting niobium-doped MoO<sub>3</sub>/ Ta<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> exhibits a lower overpotential for OER compared to undoped versions. This reduction is attributed to the combined effects of enhanced conductivity, optimized intermediate adsorption, and the creation of more active sites, all of which contribute to a more efficient catalytic process. Moreover, Nb doping can enhance the structural stability of MoO<sub>3</sub>/Ta<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> under harsh OER conditions. Nb can strengthen the bonding within the metal-oxygen framework, reducing the likelihood of catalyst degradation or dissolution during extended OER operation.

The comparison of already reported materials for OER is added in Table S4, Supporting Information, indicating that our material is comparable with other transition and rare earth metal-based materials. Thus the enhanced OER activity of the niobiumdoped MoO<sub>3</sub>/Ta<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> catalyst is attributed to a combination of electronic, structural, and kinetic factors introduced by Nb doping. These modifications lead to improved conductivity. more efficient oxygen intermediate handling, and greater structural stability, all of which contribute to the catalyst's superior performance in the OER.

#### 3.8. Most Possible Pathway for OER in Alkaline Medium

The OER follows a multistep mechanism in an alkaline environment. Initially, hydroxide ions (OH<sup>-</sup>) interact with the catalyst's active sites, leading to the formation of adsorbed hydroxyl species (step 1). These species then react with additional hydroxide ions, producing water and adsorbed atomic oxygen (O\*), while also releasing an electron (step 2). Next, the adsorbed oxygen species (O\*) combine with hydroxide ions to form peroxo intermediates (OOH) (step 3). Finally, these peroxo species react further with hydroxide ions, resulting in the formation of molecular oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) and water (step 4). This sequential process plays a crucial role in efficiently driving the OER.

# 4. Conclusion

In this study, we successfully synthesized niobium-doped composites featuring Ta2O5 decorated MoO3 nanorods, which exhibit excellent electrocatalytic performance and durability for water electrolysis applications. Comprehensive characterization techniques, including XRD, FTIR, XPS, and Raman spectroscopy, corroborated the successful formation of the MoO3/Ta2O5 composite. The electrocatalyst demonstrated a low overpotential of 238 mV for the OER at a current density of 10 mA cm-<sup>2</sup> in a 1 M KOH alkaline medium, coupled with exceptional durability. The enhanced OER activity of the MTN-8 composite can be attributed to the synergistic interactions between MoO3 and Ta2O5, as well as the benefits conferred by an 8% Nb2O5 (w/w) doping. These factors collectively contribute to an enriched availability of active sites, improved charge transport capabilities, and robust structural stability. These findings highlight the potential of noble metal-free mixed metal oxide-based composite materials as efficient electrocatalysts for overall water splitting. By demonstrating the favorable electrochemical characteristics of the Nb-doped MoO3/Ta2O5 composite, we pave the way for further exploration and development of cost-effective and sustainable electrocatalytic systems, which may significantly advance the field of renewable energy technologies.

## 5. Experimental Section

#### Preparation of MoO3

Molybdenum oxide (MoO3) was synthesized through a straightforward hydrothermal method. Initially, 2 g of ammonium heptamolybdate tetrahydrate [(NH4)6Mo7O24.4H2O] were dissolved in a solution comprising 6 mL of concentrated nitric acid (HNO3) and 50 mL of deionized water. The resulting solution underwent 10 min of stirring before being transferred to a 100 mL Teflon-coated stainless-steel autoclave for hydrothermal treatment at 180 °C over a period of 12 h. The resulting sample was recovered through centrifugation and subjected to multiple washes with deionized water and ethanol to eliminate undesired components. Finally, the product was dried in a hot air oven at 60 °C for 24 h, and then sintered at 300 °C for 3 h.[45,54]

## Preparation of MoO3/Ta2O5 (MT)

A composite material of MoO3/Ta2O5 (MT) was prepared through calcination. The synthesis process involved mixing well-prepared MoO3 and Ta2O5 in a 50:50 ratio in a crucible. This mixture was then calcined in a muffle furnace at 300 °C for 3 h. The resulting product was collected for further use given in scheme 1.

#### Doping of Nb in MoO3/Ta2O5 (MTN)

A composite material of Nb-doped MoO3/Ta2O5 (MTN) was prepared by heating a mixture of Nb2O5 and MoO3/Ta2O5 at different weight ratios (1:99 (MTN-1), 3:97 (MTN-3), 5:95 (MTN-5), 8:92 (MTN-8), and 10:90 (MTN-10)) in separate crucibles at a temperature of 200 °C for 3 h. The resulting products were then stored for future analysis.

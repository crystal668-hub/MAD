#### **ABSTRACT**

Layered double hydroxides are one of the most effective electrocatalysts owing to their compositional and structural flexibility. However, their self-stacking leads to limited active sites and low conductivity. In this work, a three-dimensional (3D) core-shell architecture with spatially separated active sites has been fabricated based on layered ternary nickel cobalt iron hydroxide (NiCoFe-LTH) nanosheets and cobalt iron Prussian blue analog (CoFe-PBA) on nickel foam (NF) (i.e., CoFe-PBA@NiCoFe-LTH/NF) with CoFe-PBA as self-sacrificial templates that are partially *in situ* transformed into NiCoFe-LTH nanosheets. The CoFe-PBA@NiCoFe-LTH/NF has a well-defined core-shell 3D flower-like nanostructure in which NiCoFe-LTH nanosheets create the larger shell while CoFe-PBA nanocubes form the small core. This hybrid structure is evaluated as an electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and found to exhibit a low overpotential of 228 mV at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, a low Tafel slope of 36 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>, and good catalytic stability for 72 h in 1.0 M alkaline solution. The strong performance is attributed to the unique 3D core-shell flower-like nanosheet architecture that avoids the stacking of the 2D LTH, provides abundant spatially separated active sites, and enhances electron transport and stability. Furthermore, the OER mechanism and growth process of the electrocatalysts were systematically studied. These results suggest that such electrocatalysts with unique architecture are promising for efficient and durable OER

Electrocatalytic water splitting (ECWS) plays an important role in the field of alternative energy conversion and storage, aiming to address the global energy crisis and related environmental problems. ECWS is composed of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The OER has relatively sluggish kinetics due to its four-electron transfer process, which greatly limits the electrocatalytic efficiency. Noble metal-based oxides, such as RuO<sub>2</sub> and IrO<sub>2</sub>, are recognized as the state-of-the-art OER electrocatalysts. However, the scarcity and high cost impede their commercial utilization. Therefore, the development of non-noble transition metal OER catalysts with highly active and durable performances is desired. 5

Recently, transition metal-based electrocatalysts have attracted extensive attention. Among them, transition-metal layered double hydroxides (LDHs) with large surface area and excellent catalytic activity show promise as non-precious metal-based OER catalysts. The general chemical formula of LDHs is  $[M^{II}_{1-x}M^{III}_x(OH)_2]^{x+}[A^{n-}_{x/n}]^{x-}.mH_2O$ , where  $M^{II}$  and  $M^{III}$  represent divalent and trivalent metal cations and  $A^{n-}$  presents the interlayered anions, such as  $NO_3^{-}$ ,  $CO_3^{2-}$ , and  $Br^{-}$ , to maintain charge balance. Several studies have demonstrated that LDH materials are promising for electrocatalysis, especially as efficient OER catalysts, revealing the relationships among the synthesis methodologies, structures, activities, and mechanisms. However, a challenge in this

field is to synchronously enhance the catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability of these LDHs-based materials using strategies, such as nanostructuring, electron structure modulation, and vacancy creation. 11–13 Partial substitution of cations can generate tri-metallic LDHs and regulate the electronic structure, which is an effective approach to improving the OER activity of LDHs. 12,14

Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) are typical metal-organic framework (MOF) materials, which are composed of metal ions and cyanide ligands with a general chemical formula of  $A_x M_a [M_b(CN)_6] \bullet nH_2O$ , where  $M_a$  and  $M_b$  indicate the transition metals and  $A_x$  indicates alkali metal/alkaline earth metal ions that exist in interstitial sites of the nanoframes.  $^{15}$  As a result, PBA nanosheet and PBA-derived bimetallic phosphides, sulfides, and metal hydroxide/oxyhydroxide electrocatalysts have been considered as promising electrocatalysis materials.  $^{16-18}$  The OER activity is improved due to the transformation to (oxy)hydroxides. PBA-derived metal hydroxides may provide a pathway to maximize the advantages of PBA and metal hydroxide materials as OER catalysts.

In this work, we demonstrate the preparation of 3D core–shell flower-like architectures with CoFe-PBA as the core and NiCoFe-LTH nanosheets as the shell using NF as the electrode substrate (denoted as CoFe-PBA@NiCoFe-LTH/NF). This electrocatalyst exhibits a low overpotential of 228 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, a small Tafel slope of 36 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>, and good catalytic stability in alkaline media. The excellent performance is attributed to the reduced stacking

of the 2D LTH, abundant spatially separated active sites, enhanced electron transport, and easy gas bubble release. Mechanisms for the growth of the electrocatalyst and OER were also studied with proposed explanations.

Schematic illustration of the synthesis of CoFe-PBA@NiCoFe-LTH/NF by a two-step process is shown in Fig. 1(a). First, the CoFe-PBA was grown through the coordination precipitation of  $\text{Co}^{2+}$  and  $[\text{Fe}(\text{CN})_6]^{3^-}$  on the surface of nickel foam (NF). Second, PBA was utilized as a sacrificial template to form the core due to its poor stability in the acidic medium as a result of the reaction of  $\text{Ni}^{2+} + \text{H}_2\text{O} = \text{Ni}(\text{OH})_2 + \text{H}^+$ . Then, the PBA template was etched by  $\text{H}^+$  to generate  $\text{Co}^{2+}$  and  $\text{Fe}^{2+}$  ions, and then, parts of them were oxidized to  $\text{Co}^{3+}$  and  $\text{Fe}^{3+}$  species,  $\text{I}^9$  respectively, by HCHO originated through the reaction of  $\text{4CH}_3\text{OH} + \text{NO}_3^- \to \text{4HCHO} + \text{NH}_3 + \text{OH}^- + 2\text{H}_2\text{O}$ . Finally, the corresponding shell materials of LTH nanosheets were formed due to  $\text{Ni}^{2+}/\text{Ni}^{3+}$ ,  $\text{Co}^{2+}/\text{Co}^{3+}$  and  $\text{Fe}^{2+}/\text{Fe}^{3+}$  reacted with  $\text{OH}^-$  and formed hydroxide monomers and then quickly nucleated on the surface of the PBA.

SEM characterizations were carried out to investigate the morphology of samples. The bare NF shows a smooth surface [Fig. 1(b)]. Figure 1(c) shows that the CoFe-PBA nanocubes grew on the surface of NF with a size distribution in 150–300 nm. For NiCo-LDH/NF, the NiCo-LDH nanosheets grew vertically along the framework of Ni substrate (Fig. S1). As shown in Fig. 1(d), the CoFe-PBA@NiCoFe-LTH/NF exhibits uniform 3D flower-like morphology, with size about 4  $\mu$ m

and thickness of the nanosheets  $\sim 10$  nm, significantly thinner than that of the NiCo-LDH/NF nanosheets ( $\sim 50$  nm). In general, the thinner the nanosheets are, the larger the surface-to-volume ratio is. SEM was conducted to observe the morphology of CoFe-PBA@NiCoFe-LTH/NF catalysts prepared with adding different amount of Ni(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>·6H<sub>2</sub>O. From the SEM images (Fig. S2), the addition of Ni(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>·6H<sub>2</sub>O leads to the formation of flower-like NiCoFe-LTH structure. It can be seen that the flowers-like nanostructures have larger and larger size and the nanosheets become thinner and thinner with the increasing of Ni(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>·6H<sub>2</sub>O. To further understand the growth process of NiCoFe-LTH nanoflowers, several electrocatalysts were prepared with different hydrothermal reaction times (1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 h). As shown in Fig. S3, the surface of CoFe-PBA template was first etched, and then, the corresponding LTH nanosheets formed on the PBA surface, forming small size flower-like nanostructures. With

the reaction time increasing, more CoFe-PBA was converted to NiCoFe-LTH and subsequently self-assembled into larger flower-like nanostructures with intercross thin nanosheets.

TEM was used to further investigate the morphology of CoFe-PBA@NiCoFe-LTH/NF. From Figs. 2(a) and 2(b), CoFe-PBA@NiCoFe-LTH/NF exhibits a unique architecture with a core–shell flower-like 3D nanostructure, with PBA cubes as core and LTH nanosheets as shell. Furthermore, the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern [inset in Fig. 2(b)] confirms the composite as polycrystalline. The high-resolution TEM images [Figs. 2(c) and 2(d)] display clear lattice fringes, and the lattice spacing of 0.25 nm is assigned to the (400) crystal planes of CoFe-PBA, 20,21 while the interplanar spacing of 0.23 nm corresponds to the (015) of NiCoFe-LTH. 22,23 Figure 2(e) shows the element mapping images of Ni, Co, Fe, C, O, and N elements by the high-angle annular dark field (HAADF) and the color elemental

dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS), demonstrating the high distribution uniformity of the six elements (Ni, Co, Fe, C, O, and N) throughout the electrocatalyst.

Figure 3(a) shows the XRD patterns of CoFe-PBA@NiCoFe-LTH/NF, CoFe-PBA/NF, and NiCo-LDH/NF. The CoFe-PBA/NF sample shows diffraction peaks at 17.6°, 24.9°, and 35.6°, which correspond to the (200), (220), and (400) planes of CoFe-PBA (JCPSD No. 31–1000).<sup>24</sup> As for NiCo-LDH/NF, the main diffraction peaks at 11.6°, 34.9°, and 39.3° can be indexed to the (003), (012), and (015) planes of NiCo-LDH (JCPSD No. 40-0216).<sup>25</sup> With the addition of Ni(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, the peaks of CoFe-PBA still remain, indicating the crystal structure is well maintained. Moreover, there are two new diffraction peaks appeared, which can be ascribed to (003) and (015) planes of NiCoFe-LTH. It is worth noting that the (003) and (015) planes of NiCoFe-LTH of CoFe-PBA@NiCoFe-LTH/NF shift to higher angles compared with NiCo-LDH/NF, and this can be attributed to the lattice shrinkage caused by Fe<sup>3+</sup> species.<sup>26</sup> Moreover, the planes for CoFe-PBA in CoFe-PBA@NiCoFe-LTH/NF have slightly downshifted due to the peak broadening attributed to the decrease in crystallinity and the decreased size of CoFe-PBA. Above result confirms that the hybrid compound of CoFe-PBA and NiCoFe-LTH was fabricated on the Ni foam substrate. To explore the formation process of core-shell structure, a series of Ni(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>·6H<sub>2</sub>O amount-depended CoFe-PBA@NiCoFe-LTH/NF hybrid catalysts were characterized by XRD (Fig. S4). XRD showed that only the diffraction peaks corresponding to the peak of PBA for samples prepared with 0.10, 0.30 mmol Ni(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>·6H<sub>2</sub>O. However, XRD showed that the diffraction peaks corresponding to the characteristic peaks of PBA and LTH for samples prepared with 0.60, 0.90, 1.2, and 1.5 mmol Ni(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>·6H<sub>2</sub>O. To explore the NiCoFe-LTH nanoflowers growth process, several samples were prepared with different hydrothermal reaction times (1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 h). In Fig. S5, the XRD result exhibits the wellmaintained diffraction peaks of CoFe-PBA, and the (003) plane of NiCoFe-LTH gradually emerged with the increase in hydrothermal

In Fig. 3(b), the absorption peaks at 3390 and  $1610 \, \mathrm{cm}^{-1}$  can be assigned to characteristic O-H stretching vibration and H–O–H bending vibration, demonstrating the presence of  $\mathrm{H_2O}$  molecules.<sup>27</sup> The peak at  $2090 \, \mathrm{cm}^{-1}$  is related to the C $\equiv$ N vibration in the CoFe-PBA.<sup>28</sup> The bands at around 2349 and  $667 \, \mathrm{cm}^{-1}$  correspond to the stretching vibration and deformation vibration of  $\mathrm{CO_2}$ . The peak at  $1060 \, \mathrm{cm}^{-1}$  is attributed to the vibration mode of C–O.<sup>28</sup> Additionally, the peak at  $584 \, \mathrm{cm}^{-1}$  is ascribed to the flexural vibration of Fe-CN band.<sup>29</sup> The

LDH and PBA peaks in XRD and FT-IR spectra also confirmed that the target composite was prepared.

The XPS survey spectra of CoFe-PBA@NiCoFe-LTH/NF (Fig. S6) and CoFe-PBA/NF [Fig. S8(a)] reveal the coexistence of Ni, Co, Fe, C, N, and O elements. Compared to CoFe-PBA/NF, the signal of N 1s is not obvious in CoFe-PBA@NiCoFe-LTH/NF, which can be attributed to the CoFe-PBA being wrapped by LTH shell. The XPS analysis for CoFe-PBA@NiCoFe-LTH/NF is presented in Fig. 4. In the high-resolution Ni 2p spectra [Fig. 4(a)], the peaks at 855.1 and 872.6 eV are related to Ni  $2p_{3/2}$  and Ni  $2p_{1/2}$  of Ni<sup>2+</sup>, while the other two peaks at 856.4 and 874.1 eV are assigned to Ni 2p<sub>3/2</sub> and Ni 2p<sub>1/2</sub> of Ni<sup>3+</sup>, <sup>30</sup> suggesting the multiple valence states of Ni. The same result is also found in the Ni 2p XPS spectra of NiCo-LDH/NF [Fig. S7(b)], but mainly in the form of Ni<sup>2+</sup>. In Fig. 4(c), the Co 2p spectrum is split into Co  $2p_{3/2}$  (780.5 and 782.3 eV) and  $2p_{3/2}$  (796.2 and 797.7 eV), indicating the co-existence of Co<sup>3+</sup> and Co<sup>2+,30</sup> The Co 2p spectra of NiCo-LDH/NF and CoFe-PBA/NF are shown in Figs. S7(c) and S8(b), which clearly indicate that the majority of Co element in CoFe-PBA/ NF and NiCo-LDH/NF are Co<sup>2+'</sup> and Co<sup>3+</sup>, respectively. For highresolution Fe 2p spectrum [Fig. 4(b)], the peaks at around 708.2 (Fe  $2p_{3/2}$ ) and 721.1 eV (Fe  $2p_{1/2}$ ) are ascribed to the  $[Fe(CN)_6]^{4-31}$  and the banding energy around 710.6 eV corresponds to  $[Fe(CN)_6]^{3-.32}$ Furthermore, the binding energies located at 713.2 eV (Fe 2p<sub>3/2</sub>) and 723.8 (Fe  $2p_{1/2}$ ) are associated with Fe<sup>3+</sup> oxidation state, which belongs to Fe3+-OH and Fe3+-OOH in NiCoFe-LTH, respectively. 26,33 As for Fe 2p spectrum of CoFe-PBA [Fig. S8(c)], two obvious peaks appear at 708.2 and 721.2 eV and correspond to Fe 2p<sub>3/2</sub> and Fe  $2p_{1/2}$ , respectively, indicating that the valence of Fe is +2 in the form of [Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>4</sup>. Although CoFe-PBA was prepared by using Co(II) salt and Fe(III) cyanide, the electron in the anti-bonding e<sub>g</sub>\* orbital of Co<sup>2+</sup> can transfer to the bonding t<sub>2g</sub> orbital of Fe<sup>3+</sup> to maximize the ligand field stabilization energy in the PBA framework, resulting in partial formation of Co<sup>3+</sup>. Therefore, the Co 2p spectrum reveals the coexistence of Co<sup>2+</sup> and Co<sup>3+</sup> and only Fe<sup>2+</sup> in Fe 2p spectrum of CoFe-PBA. The C 1s XPS spectra of CoFe-PBA@NiCoFe-LTH/NF [Fig. 4(d)] and CoFe-PBA/NF [Fig. S8(d)] can be deconvoluted into four species: two distinctive peaks of C-C and C-N at 284.6 and 285.4 eV, as well as two peaks at 286.3 and 288.6 eV that are attributed to the C-O and C=O group, respectively,<sup>35</sup> while the C 1s of NiCo-LDH/NF[Fig. S7(d)] shows only three peaks (C-C, C-O, and C=O). In Fig. 4(e), the high-resolution N1s spectrum shows the N species predominately as C≡N bond at the binding energy of 398.1 eV, which confirms that CoFe-PBA is

remaining, and the peak at 402.6 eV is oxidized-N species formed during the hydrothermal reaction.<sup>32</sup> Moreover, only one main peak corresponding to the C≡N group is observed in the N 1s spectrum of CoFe-PBA/NF [Fig. S8(e)]. The spectra of O 1s for CoFe-PBA@NiCoFe-LTH/NF [Fig. 4(f)] and NiCo-LDH/NF [Fig. S7(e)] can be deconvoluted into three peaks: the peak at 529.8 eV corresponds to the typical metal-oxygen bonds (M-O),<sup>36</sup> while other two peaks at 531.1 and 532.2 eV correspond to the hydroxyl groups and oxygen vacancies, respectively.37 Compared to NiCo-LDH/NF, CoFe-PBA@NiCoFe-LTH/NF showed a substantially enhanced oxygen vacancy peak. Oxygen vacancies play a vital role in facilitating the adsorption of OH<sup>-</sup> and other intermediates.<sup>38</sup> Furthermore, owing to the existence of oxygen vacancies, the electrons in the O 2p orbital in CoFe-PBA@NiCoFe-LTH/NF are delocalized around surrounding metal sites and transferred to the conduction band, 36 thereby effectively enhancing the OER performance.

Figure S9 shows the cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of CoFe-PBA@NiCoFe-LTH/NF, NiCo-LDH/NF, CoFe-PBA/NF, RuO<sub>2</sub>/NF, and NF measured at a scan rate of 5 mV s<sup>-1</sup> in a potential range between 0.924 and 1.724 V (vs RHE). To avoid overlapping signals between the oxidation of Ni<sup>2+</sup>/Ni<sup>3+</sup> and the OER, the polarization curves were recorded from high initial potential to low potential at a scan rate of 1 mV s<sup>-1</sup>. Figure 5(a) shows the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) (with *iR*-correction), the CoFe-PBA@NiCoFe-LTH/NF exhibits much improved electrocatalytic activity with a lower overpotential of 228 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, which is smaller than CoFe-PBA/NF (298 mV), NiCo-LDH/NF (265 mV), RuO<sub>2</sub>/NF (265 mV), and NF (360 mV) under the identical conditions. Notably,

the impressive OER activity of CoFe-PBA@NiCoFe-LTH/NF is much better than or comparable with the previous reported MOFs and LDHs based catalysts (Table S1). As shown in Fig. 5(b), the CoFe-PBA@NiCoFe-LTH/NF also displays the smallest overpotentials at 50 and 100 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. Additionally, the OER kinetics are further analyzed by the corresponding Tafel slopes in Fig. 5(c), and CoFe-PBA@NiCoFe-LTH/NF shows the lowest Tafel slope of 36 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>, which is much smaller than that of NiCo-LDH/NF (46 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>), CoFe-PBA/NF (53 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>), RuO<sub>2</sub>/NF (51 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>), and NF (82 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>). The lower value of Tafel slope is highly favorable for fast kinetics during the OER, confirming higher OER kinetics of the CoFe-PBA@NiCoFe-LTH/NF under alkaline electrolyte.

Figure 5(d) shows the corresponding Nyquist plots, where the two-time constant serial (2TS) model [Fig. S10(a)] was used to fit the impedance spectrum of CoFe-PBA@NiCoFe-LTH/NF and corresponding parameters are listed in SI. Moreover, the Randles equivalent circuit [Fig. S10(b)] was applied to fit the data of other samples. Significantly, the  $R_{s}$ ,  $R_{pop}$ , and  $R_{ct}$  represent the solution resistance, porosity resistance, and charge transfer resistance, respectively.<sup>39</sup> The CoFe-PBA@NiCoFe-LTH/NF shows the relatively small R<sub>ct</sub> value (1.4  $\Omega$ ), which is much smaller than that of NiCo-LDH/NF (4.9  $\Omega$ ), CoFe-PBA/NF (12.2  $\Omega$ ), RuO<sub>2</sub>/NF (4.6  $\Omega$ ), and NF (36.9  $\Omega$ ). The smaller  $R_{\rm ct}$ value of CoFe-PBA@NiCoFe-LTH/NF illustrates a lower charge transport barrier at the interface of electrode/electrolyte, as well as a significant acceleration of charge transfer rate and faster OER kinetics. This result is attributed to the in situ grown CoFe-PBA@NiCoFe-LTH anchored on NF, the formed interfaces between CoFe-PBA and NiCoFe-LTH phase, which can enhance charge transfer.

Furthermore, we evaluated the electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) of the hybrid electrocatalyst by calculating the double-layer capacitance ( $C_{\rm cll}$ ) using CV. The value of  $C_{\rm cll}$  can be fitted from the detailed CV curves with a series of different scan rates (Fig. S11). Generally, the ECSA has a positive correlation with  $C_{\rm cll}$ . As can be seen from Fig. 5(e), the CoFe-PBA@NiCoFe-LTH/NF has the  $C_{\rm cll}$  value of 2.79 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>, higher than the values of CoFe-PBA/NF (1.48 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>), NiCo-LDH/NF (2.36 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>), and NF (1.01 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>). To investigate the intrinsic activity of these samples, the apparent current density was normalized to the corresponding ECSA. Figure S12 shows the normalized OER LSV curves of CoFe-PBA@NiCoFe-LTH/NF, CoFe-PBA/NF, NiCo-LDH/NF, and NF. The OER activity of CoFe-PBA@NiCoFe-LTH/NF remains higher than that of other samples, indicating superior intrinsic activity and that the strategy of *in situ* transformation of LTH on PBA surface can improve the OER activity.

In addition, the electrocatalysts with different amounts of Ni(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>·6H<sub>2</sub>O (0.10, 0.30, 0.60, 0.90, 1.2, and 1.5 mmol) were

fabricated to investigate the effect of Ni(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> on the catalytic activity. Figure S13 shows the LSV curves and the corresponding Tafel slopes of the electrocatalysts. These results show that the electrocatalysts obtained using more than 0.90 mmol nickel nitrate show OER activity declining due to stacking of NiCoFe-LTH nanosheet, and the CoFe-PBA@NiCoFe-LTH/NF shows the best catalytic activity. Moreover, the Tafel slope (36 mV dec $^{-1}$ ) of CoFe-PBA@NiCoFe-LTH/NF is close to the theoretical value of 40 mV dec $^{-1}$ , indicating the exchange of the second electron as the rate-determining step.  $^{40}$  This suggests the reaction of OH $^-$  + OH $^*$   $\rightarrow$  H<sub>2</sub>O + O $^*$  + e $^-$  is the rate-determining step. The electrocatalytic processes are illustrated in Fig. S14, and the OER mechanisms are discussed in detail in supplementary material.

Finally, the electrochemical stability of CoFe-PBA@NiCoFe-LTH/NF was evaluated by the chronoamperometric *j*-t curve at a static potential of 1.484 V vs RHE for 72 h in 1.0 M KOH. As shown in Fig. 5(f), the OER activity not only did not decrease, but the *j*-t curve also showed an increased anode current during successive electrolysis.

<span id="page-7-0"></span>FIG. 6. (a) XRD and (b) FT-IR spectra of CoFe-PBA@NiCoFe-LTH/NF recorded before and after OER. [(c) and (d)] SEM images of CoFe-PBA@NiCoFe-LTH/NF after OER test.

Meanwhile, the long-term durability of CoFe-PBA@NiCoFe-LTH/NF was also characterized by chronopotentiometry method at 50 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> (Fig. S15). The chronopotentiometry curves show a reduced potential from 1.568 to 1.541 V (vs RHE) after 28 h in 1.0 M KOH. The results indicate that more active substances were produced during the OER process. In this case, CoFe-PBA could be transformed into Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> and subsequently into CoOOH in alkaline medium during the OER process, 41,42 and the outer LTH acts as a shell layer to protect PBA, which reduces the chance of direct contact between PBA and electrolyte, avoiding full conversion of PBA in a short time during the OER process.

As shown in Fig. S16, the volume of the produced  $\rm O_2$  is consistent with the theoretical calculation value (Faradaic efficiency close to 100%) at the fix current of 50 mA, demonstrating high Faradaic efficiency of the CoFe-PBA@NiCoFe-LTH/NF in oxygen production.

The XRD, the FTIR, and the SEM of CoFe-PBA@NiCoFe-LTH/NF after the durability test are shown in Fig. 6. In addition, the XRD patterns (Fig. S17) and SEM images (Figs. S18 and S19) of CoFe-PBA/NF and NiCo-LDH/NF were also recorded. Meanwhile, XPS was conducted after stability measurement, as shown in Fig. S20. All of the above characterizations are discussed in detail in supplementary material and demonstrate that MOH nanocrystals are partially converted to MOOH amorphous phase forming an amorphous shell on the surface of NiCoFe-LTH after long-term OER, consistent with previous report. 43-45

In summary, we synthesized a high-performance electrocatalyst with the core-shell CoFe-PBA@NiCoFe-LTH structure grown on NF via a facile two-step method. Specifically, NiCoFe nanosheets were *in situ* synthesized through a hydrothermal reaction using CoFe-PBA nanocubes as sacrificial templates. The CoFe-PBA@NiCoFe-LTH/NF exhibits strong electrocatalytic activity in alkaline medium with an overpotential as low as 228 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, a small Tafel slope of 36 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>, and excellent long-term stability.

The excellent performance is attributed to the unique 3D flower-like core-shell architecture with open space, which significantly reduces the stacking of the 2D LTH and provides rich active sites as well as 3D channels for rapid electron transport and easy release of gas bubbles. The mechanisms of OER growth of the 3D core-shell electrocatalyst were also studied to help gain deeper understanding of some of the fundamental processes involved. This work demonstrates a strategy to design electrocatalysts with unique 3D architecture derived from the PBA template for water oxidation application.

See the supplementary material for a complete description of the experimental details, including materials synthesis and characterization as well as results on SEM, XRD, XPS, and electrochemistry, along with the proposed OER mechanism.

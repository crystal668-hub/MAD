Transition metal phosphonates have recently gained attentions as efficient catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this paper, flower-like nickel-cobalt phenylphosphonate microspheres were sythesized, which could be used as excellent electrocatalyst for OER. After calcined at high temperature in air, resulted product of metal pyrophosphate exhibited outstanding electrocatalytic property. A small amount of carbon coming from the pyrolysis of phenylphosphonate were doped in matrix of metal pyrophosphonate, which promoted the OER catalysis by improving the electron transfer of material. Sample denoted as CoNiPP-600 had the most excellent catalytic activity, with a current density of 10 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> at a lower over-potential of 264 mV, Tafel slope of 60 mV·dec-<sup>1</sup> and superior durability in 1.0 M KOH solution.

### Introduction

Due to the need for sustainable energy and the consumption of fossil fuels, the energy conversion and storage technologies have recently attracted extensive attentions, such as water splitting and metalair batteries.[1–5] Oxygen evolution reaction is critical part of water splitting. However, the reaction is more intricate and has lower OER dynamics, because of the oxidation of four electrons and the decomposition of two water molecules.[6–9] Furthermore, in order to overcome the overpotential caused by some resistances and reduce energy loss, we have to develop unexpansive electrocatalysts with highly efficient for OER. Electrocatalytic activity for OER is closely correlated with active sites, which can be rationally designed by morphology, pore structure[10,11] and crystallinity[12,13] etc.

Metal phosphonates, which are well known as an important branch of organic–inorganic hybrid materials, have attracted many interests for their diverse structures and applications in many areas such as gas sorption,[14] ion exchange,[15] supercapacitor,[16] catalysis,[17] magnetism,[18] so on. Metal phosphonates have also been reported in many literatures due to their abundant storage capacity, environmental benignity and corrosive resistance in alkaline solution.[19–22] Among them, transition metal phosphonate catalysts have become a promising alternative for the electrocatalytic reaction.[23–26] For instance, the Ni12P5, Ni12P5-Ni2P and Ni2P nanoparticles reported by Norbert Koch et al. showed excellent electrocatalytic property.[27] Xin Shi et al. designed and synthesized the flower-like nickel phenylphosphonate microspheres, their pyrolysis products were suitable as supercapacitor electrode material.[28] Furthermore, the addition of two or more transition metal elements (such as Ni, Fe, Se) is an effective way to improve electronic migration and conductivity of catalysts.[29–31]

In this paper, the flower-like mixed transition metal phenylphosphonate precursors were prepared using the phenylphosphonic acid by hydrothermal method. Be pyrolyzed in air for 3 hours at different temperatures, the flower-like Co2P2O7 and CoNiP2O7 catalysts, which denoted as CoPP-T and CoNiPP-T (T=600, 900 8C), have been obtained. The flower-like CoPP and CoNiPP precursors consist of many two-dimensional plate-like petals, and basically maintain their original shape after pyrolysis. The flower-like microspheres can promote the electrochemical reaction for their larger surface areas. The flower-like CoNiPP-600 catalyst exhibited a current density of 10 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> at a lowest over-potential of 264 mV with a small Tafel slope of 60 mV·dec-<sup>1</sup> in 1.0 M KOH solution and showed long-term stability. The convenient approach of synthesis of cobalt-nickel phenylphosphonates as OER catalysts can be extended to versatile of metal phosphonates. There are great chances to find optimized OER catalysts for water splitting and apply in renewable energy area.

### Results and Discussion

As shown in Figure S1(see Supporting Information), the thermal stability of CoPP and CoNiPP precursors was illustrated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) under air atmosphere. Both samples have two stages of weight loss. The first weight loss occured at about 200 8C, mainly because of the loss of crystalline water molecules. Within the temperature range of 550 8C to 700 8C, the second weight loss indicates the decomposition of organic phenyl groups. As the temperature continues to rise, organic phenyl groups gradually decomposed completely and formed the stable phase (Co2P2O7 or CoNiP2O7).

Based on the results of TG analysis, we selected  $600\,^{\circ}\text{C}$  and  $900\,^{\circ}\text{C}$  as the pyrolysis temperature of the precursors to obtain the electrochemical catalysts CoPP–T and CoNiPP–T (T=600,  $900\,^{\circ}\text{C}$ ).

Figure 1 presented the PXRD pattern of as-prepared CoPP and CoNiPP precursors. According to the PDF card, the position

of the diffraction peaks of  $Co(O_3PC_6H_5)\cdot H_2O$  and  $Ni(O_3PC_6H_5)\cdot H_2O$  are identical and corresponding to the as-prepared CoPP and CoNiPP precursors. For CoPP precursors, the five diffraction peaks appearing at  $6.14^\circ$ ,  $12.29^\circ$ ,  $16.92^\circ$ ,  $18.49^\circ$  and  $19.28^\circ$ , corresponding to (010), (020), (110), (030) and (011) planes, which accords with  $Co(O_3PC_6H_5)\cdot H_2O$  (JCPDS No. 51–2096); And for CoNiPP, as a result of the addition of nickel element, CoNiPP should have  $Co(O_3PC_6H_5)\cdot H_2O$  and  $Ni(O_3PC_6H_5)\cdot H_2O$  (JCPDS No. 49–2391) compositions.<sup>[28]</sup> Figure S2 (see Supporting Informa-

tion) shows XRD patterns of CoPP–T (T=600, 900 °C) and CoNiPP–T (T=600, 900 °C). A relatively low peak at 20 value of about 30° in the PXRD spectrum indicates that CoPP-600 °C belongs to  $\text{Co}_2\text{P}_2\text{O}_7$  with poor crystallinity; The PXRD pattern of CoPP-900 match well with the standard pattern of  $\text{Co}_2\text{P}_2\text{O}_7$  (JCPDS No. 70–1491). Meanwhile, the PXRD pattern of CoNiPP-600 and CoNiPP-900 accords with the standard card of  $\text{CoNiP}_2\text{O}_7$  (JCPDS No. 48–0563). Obviously, higher pyrolysis temperature led to a better crystallinity.

As shown in Figure 2, the morphologies of samples were performed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Figure 2 (a) and (d) showed the SEM images of as-prepared CoPP and CoNiPP precursors at high magnification, respectively. Obviously, the as-prepared CoPP and CoNiPP precursors were flower-like microspheres with an average size of 30 µm, which consist of large amounts of laminated petals. With the increasing of calcination temperature, it is clear that the flowerlike shape of CoNiPP-T remain more complete than CoPP-T (T=600, 900  $^{\circ}$ C), and both of them have slight variations in size. Moreover, the SEM images of CoNiPP materials ( $M_{Co}: M_{Ni} =$ 9:1, 8:2, 7:3 and 6:4) were shown in Figure S3(see Supporting Information). With the increasing of the molar weight of nickel, it is obvious that CoNiPP microspheres gradually grew into more compact structure; And the density difference between Figure S3 (c) and (d) is slight, so CoNiPP ( $M_{Co}: M_{Ni} = 7:3$ ) was selected as the research object.

For analyzing the content of elements, the elemental mappings of the flower-like CoNiPP-600 catalysts were performed. As shown in Figure 2(g) and Table S1, the flower-like CoNiPP-600 microspheres mainly contain cobalt, nickel, phosphorus, oxygen, carbon elements. In comparison with CoNiPP-900, there is carbon element in the constituent elements of CoNiPP-600, the scarce amounts of carbon were coming from the incompletely reaction of organic groups with air, accounted for only 5.71%. Moreover, the carbon doping plays a bridging role in promoting electron penetration or interfacial electron transfer.

were given in Figure 3(b-f). As shown in Figure 3(b), two major peaks at binding energy of 781.7 eV and 797.8 eV pertain to  $Co2p_{3/2}$  and  $Co\ 2p_{1/2}$  peaks, which can be vested in  $Co^{2+}[^{32,33,34}]$  In Figure 3(c), in the  $Ni_{2p}$  spectrum, we can ascribe two peaks at 873.7 eV and 856.4 eV to  $Ni\ 2p_{1/2}$  and  $Ni\ 2p_{3/2}$ , respectively. For the peak of  $P_{2p}$  in 133.2 eV (Figure 3d), demonstrating that the P atoms are +5 oxidation state.  $O_{1s}$  spectrum can be seen with two sub-peaks (Figure 3e). Peaks centered at 531.3 eV and 532.0 eV are assigned to the  $O_{1s}$  core levels in phosphate species and adsorbed water within the  $CoNiP_2O_7$  microspheres. One sub-peak in the  $C_{1s}$  spectrum is located at 284.6 eV (Figure 3f), which is characteristic of carbon bounded-carbon (C-C).  $^{[32,36,37]}$  The other peak centered at 287.8 eV was assigned to carbon binding with oxygen groups (C-O).

In order to further explore the electrochemical behavior of the flower-like CoPP–T and CoNiPP–T ( $T=600,\,900\,^{\circ}$ C) catalysts, the LSV curves and the corresponding Tafel plots were conducted. The over-potential at a current density of  $10\,\mathrm{mA\cdot cm^{-2}}$  and the corresponding Tafel slope, which are key parameters to evaluate the electrochemical performance. In

Figure S5(see Supporting Information), the over-potential at a current density of 10 mA·cm<sup>-2</sup> of the CoPP-T (T=600, 900 °C) catalysts were 277 mV, 330 mV, respectively; In comparison with CoPP-T, the over-potential at a current density of 10 mA·cm<sup>-2</sup> of the CoNiPP–T (T=600, 900 °C) catalysts were 264 mV, 310 mV, which were a little lower than CoPP-T. Tafel plots are established based on LSV curves. As shown in Figure 4, Tafel slope value of CoNiPP-600 is 60 mV·dec<sup>-1</sup>, smaller than CoPP-600 (68 mV·dec<sup>-1</sup>). In terms of two important parameters, the flower-like CoNiPP-600 microspheres exhibited relatively better OER activity with lower over-potential and Tafel slope. According to the PXRD pattern (Figure S2 in the Supporting Information), the CoNiPP-600 catalysts belongs to CoNiP<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> with poor crystallinity, which provide more active sites for OER due to the existence of internal defects; [39] In addition, transition metal nickel can also increase the active sites.[40] Stability test showed that the CoNiPP-600 catalysts almost consistent with the OER polarization curves as initial catalyst after 1000 cycles, with negligible increase of the overpotential (Figure 4c). Moreover, we tested the flower-like CoPP-

600 and CoNiPP-600 catalysts by the amperometric i–t tests in a continuous ten-hour at a constant potential (Figure 4d). The CoPP-600 and CoNiPP-600 catalysts showed ~4.7% and ~3.46% current change after 8 h of testing, respectively. Therefore, the flower-like CoNiPP-600 microspheres are catalysts for the best OER performance.

### Conclusions

To sum up, we synthesized the flower-like CoPP-600 and CoNiPP-600 microspheres by the pyrolysis process, which were three-dimensional structure with many flaky petals. In the resulting catalysts, the flower-like CoNiPP-600 microspheres have the most superior OER performance, the excellent performance of CoNiPP-600 is attributed to its favorable structures. The poor crystallinity and the doping of Ni element contribute to more active sites, which enhanced the OER catalytic activity. Furthermore, doping of a small amount of carbon derived from pyrolysis of phenyl groups can also promote the electron transfer, the stability and catalytic activity of the materials. This method can be applied to explore the metal phosphonates usage in electrochemical energy conservation and storage.

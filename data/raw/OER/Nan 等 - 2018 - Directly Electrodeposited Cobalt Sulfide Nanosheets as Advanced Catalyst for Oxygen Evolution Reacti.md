CoS, a low cost and efficient electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), has attract great research interest but its electrosynthesis to delicately tune the nanostructures has not been carried out. Herein, for the first time by the use of potassium thiocyanate (KSCN) as sulfur source, CoS nanosheets are time-controlled electrosynthesized and further evolved to a 3D flower-like nanostructure, in which KSCN plays a critical role. With a deposition time of 1200s, the catalyst shows excellent catalytic activity toward OER, achieving a small Tafel slope of

 $55 \, \mathrm{mV} \, \mathrm{dec^{-1}}$  and only requires an overpotential of 310 mV to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, better than the benchmark  $\mathrm{IrO_2}$  and other electrodeposited cobalt sulfide catalysts. The enhancement mechanism is attributed to the unique nanostructure offering a large electroactive surface while allowing reactants accessing the reaction surface and the produced oxygen bubble escaping out for a fast electrode kinetics toward OER.

### Introduction

The global energy crisis and increasing environmental pollutions have driven an urgent demand for renewable and ecofriendly alternative energy sources rather than fossil fuels.[1] Clean and renewable hydrogen energy is proposed to be an ideal candidate to replace fossil fuels in the future.[2] Water electrolysis provides a facile approach for hydrogen production, which has two half-cell reactions, including hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER).[3] However, the OER involves four-electron transfer steps and suffers from sluggish electrode kinetics with high overpotentials for significant energy loss during water electrolysis, and thus efficient electrocatalysts toward OER are greatly demanded.[4] Although noble metal oxides such as IrO<sub>2</sub> and RuO<sub>2</sub> are recognized as the most robust and effective catalysts for OER, [5] the global scarcity and high cost greatly hinder their practical applications. Therefore, a highly active and earth-abundant materials-based OER electrocatalyst is of great importance for mass-production of hydrogen fuel via water electrolysis. [6]

Great efforts have been devoted to the development of non-noble catalysts toward OER, such as transition metal

compounds<sup>[7]</sup> and carbon materials<sup>[8]</sup> etc. are identified as OER catalysts. Among the reported works, cobalt-based materials are extensively studied due to their good catalytic activity.<sup>[9]</sup> Up to date, cobalt-based compounds including phosphates,<sup>[10]</sup> oxides,<sup>[11]</sup> selenides<sup>[12]</sup> and sulfides<sup>[13]</sup> have been reported as efficient OER catalysts, of which cobalt sulfides attract tremendous research attention owing to their prominent catalytic activities in OER and ORR.<sup>[13a,14]</sup> Currently, cobalt sulfide catalysts are mainly synthesized by high temperature conversion or hydrothermal methods,<sup>[15]</sup> however, these approaches are energy consuming processes while involving tedious multistep and high temperature condition, thus are unrealistic for practical applications. Therefore, a facile and easy controlled strategy is urgently needed for the fabrication of cobalt sulfide material.

Electrodeposition is a simple and universal method in material synthesis with relatively low cost, in which the growth rate, morphology and loading of the synthesized material can be well controlled by the electrodeposition parameters, such as electrode potential, deposition time and current density. [16] In addition, electrodeposition technique is able to produce highly pure and uniform films on substrates under room-temperature. thus eliminating the extra energy loss and thermal stress problems.[17] Therefore, this strategy is widely applied in material synthesis, including preparation of transition metal sulfides.[18] Cobalt sulfides are also electrochemically synthesized as electrode materials for supercapacitor, [19] HER[18a] and solar cell.[20] Wang et al. investigated the OER catalytic activities of electrochemically synthesized cobalt sulfide using thiourea and Co(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> as precursors. [1a] However, it is known that the NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> in aqueous solution could be transferred to NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> and OH<sup>-</sup> under reduction potential, and the produced OH<sup>-</sup> could further react with Co<sup>2+</sup> to form Co(OH)<sub>2</sub>,<sup>[21]</sup> thus this recipe is unacceptable for the synthesis of cobalt sulfide. While Liu et al. reported to obtain cobalt sulfide as an OER catalyst via electrodeposition method by the use of thiourea and CoCl<sub>2</sub> as

raw materials.<sup>[22]</sup> In these two works and some other reports, <sup>[18a,23]</sup> thiourea is used as the sulfur source for electrochemical synthesis of cobalt sulfide. Unfortunately, two main disadvantages are recognized during the application of thiourea. Firstly, thiourea (CH<sub>4</sub>N<sub>2</sub>S) is not stable enough in aqueous solution, and is easy being hydrolyzed to toxic H<sub>2</sub>S, NH<sub>3</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> gas, <sup>[24]</sup> which are harmful to the environment. Secondly, thiourea poses a carcinogenic risk to animals and human beings. <sup>[25]</sup> Therefore, it is still highly demanded to electrochemically synthesize cobalt sulfide by uses of an eco-friendly sulfur source.

Potassium thiocyanate (KSCN) is a useful indicator for detection of Fe<sup>3+,[26]</sup> In aqueous solution, KSCN will dissociate to SCN<sup>-</sup> and K<sup>+</sup>. The SCN<sup>-</sup> is a linear anion and it can form various complexes by S or N atom coordination with transition metal ions.<sup>[27]</sup> The SCN<sup>-</sup> ligand is also known to promote the electrochemical reactions with its two coordination sites with metal ions for adsorption onto an electrode surface.<sup>[28]</sup> Moreover, the chemical stability of KSCN is superior than that of thiourea.<sup>[29]</sup> We expect that the unique properties of KSCN would be a benefit when applied as a sulfur source in electrochemical synthesis of cobalt sulfide.

Herein, we report a direct electrodeposition method to prepare cobalt sulfide nanosheets film (ED-CoS) on Ti foils as an

efficient and robust OER electrocatalyst using KSCN and CoSO<sub>4</sub> as sulfur and cobalt sources, respectively. The ED-CoS presents a unique nanosheet-like structure, which could further assemble to a flower-like morphology for an interesting hierarchical structure, which could expose more active sites to electrolyte while providing possible electrons transfer pathways and escaping channels for oxygen bubbles. Furthermore, CoS is directly grown on Ti foil substrate for a binder-free electrode toward OER, which not only reduces the series resistance but also helps to expose more active sites without the polymeric binder.<sup>[7]</sup> The as-prepared ED-CoS catalyst exhibits remarkable OER catalytic activity and superior stability in alkaline media, which outperforms the benchmark IrO<sub>2</sub> and other reported cobalt sulfide catalysts prepared via electrochemical methods.

## **Results and Discussion**

Electrodeposition of cobalt sulfide was achieved by the use of KSCN and CoSO<sub>4</sub> as sulfur and cobalt resources, respectively. FESEM images of ED-CoS (1200s) with an electrodeposition time of 1200s are shown in Figure 1a and Figure 1b, nanoflower-like structure is observed. The nanoflowers consist of nanosheets and the thickness of a single sheet is about 14 nm. The nanosheets assemble into nanoflower for a unique three-

dimensional hierarchical structure, which probably relates to the critical role of KSCN sulfur source that used in this work. The XRD patterns of ED-CoS (1200s) and Ti substrate are shown in Figure S1. Owing to the material is prepared via electrodeposition technique under room temperature, the crystallinity of the as-prepared product is low and only a broad peak locat ed at 46.6° corresponding to (102) plane of CoS is observed (JCPDS No. 75-0605).[30]

TEM image in Figure 1c further confirms its nanosheet-like structure. A lattice fringe of 0.19 nm corresponding to (102) plane of CoS is observed in high-resolution TEM image (Figure 1d). EDS spectrum of ED-CoS (1200s) is displayed in Figure S2a, the signals of Co. S. O and Ti are detected. The presence of Co. S and Ti elements agree well with the chemical composition of cobalt sulfide and Ti foil, while the O probably results from the surface absorbed water. These results suggest that the CoS nanosheets are successfully grown on Ti substrate. In order to remove the surface oxide of Ti foil and enhance the adhesion between catalyst and substrate, the Ti foils used in this work were pretreated in a hot HCl solution. The treated bare Ti foils present a rough surface (Figure S3a), which would be a benefit for stabilizing the electrodeposited cobalt sulfide, thus improving the OER stability. Interestingly, when the absence of KSCN in electrolyte, only irregular ball-like structure

is obtained (Figure S3b). The corresponding EDS spectrum shows that only Co and Ti elements exist in the material (Figure S2b), indicating the irregular balls consist form metallic cobalt (denoted as ED-Co).

XPS measurements were carried out to further study the as-deposited catalyst. The spectrum of ED-CoS (1200s) has signals of Co, S, O, N and C (Figure 2a), the presence of Co, S and O elements in line with the EDS measurement, while the N and C elements could be attributed to KSCN that absorbed on the catalyst surface. The high-resolution XPS spectra of Co 2p and S 2p regions are shown in Figure 2b and Figure 2c. In Co 2p region, the peaks at 779.8 and 780.7 eV can be assigned to Co 2p<sub>3/2</sub>, while the peaks at 794.8 and 796.5 eV correspond to Co  $2p_{1/2}$ . Another two peaks at 785.9 and 802.3 eV can be sequentially attributed to the satellite peaks of Co 2p<sub>3/2</sub> and Co 2p<sub>1/2</sub>.[32] There are three prominent peaks are observed in S 2p region, the peaks at 161.3 and 162.8 eV corresponding to S  $2p_{3/2}$  and S  $2p_{1/2^{\prime}}^{[33]}$  respectively, which can be assigned to  $S^{2-}$ ligand in CoS. While the peak centers at 168.7 eV can be assigned to  $SO_4^{2-}$ , probably resulting from the surface adsorbed CoSO<sub>4</sub>.[34]

FTIR spectra of ED-CoS (1200s) and KSCN precursor are shown in Figure 2d. The spectrum of KSCN precursor shows typical vibration modes of  $v_{\text{C-S}}$  (740 cm<sup>-1</sup>) and  $v_{\text{C-N}}$  (2059 cm<sup>-1</sup>)

in SCN-. [35] While the peak at ~3400 cm-<sup>1</sup> corresponds to O-H stretching vibration, which can be ascribed to the absorption of H2O.[36] However, in the spectrum of ED-CoS (1200s) the peaks corresponding to KSCN are invisible, while new peaks at ~540 cm-<sup>1</sup> and ~620 cm-<sup>1</sup> corresponding to stretching vibration of Co-S bond and surface cobalt atoms of CoS are observed, respectively.[37] In addition, the strong peak at ~1060 cm-<sup>1</sup> is assigned to the stretching model of Co=S.[38] These results reveal that KSCN is converted to CoS after electrodeposition.

The electrochemical behaviour of ED-CoS (1200s) is investigated in 1.0 M KOH, the benchmark IrO2/C (20%) catalyst is also studied for comparison. The polarization curves of ED-CoS (1200s), ED-Co, Ti foil and IrO2 catalysts are shown in Figure 3a. Bare Ti foil has poor OER activity. Amazingly, ED-CoS (1200s) exhibits a low OER onset overpotential of 280 mV and only needs a small overpotential of 310 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm-<sup>2</sup> (h10=310 mV). However, the benchmark IrO2 catalyst shows a h<sup>10</sup> of 330 mV, higher than that of ED-CoS (1200s) catalyst, indicating the superior OER catalytic activity of ED-CoS electrode. However, ED-Co exhibits a higher h<sup>10</sup> of 480 mV, suggesting the catalytic activity of ED-Co is much poorer than that of ED-CoS (1200s). In terms of h10, the catalytic performance achieved by ED-CoS (1200s) catalyst outperforms reported cobalt sulfide and nickel sulfide catalysts that prepared via electrochemical method, including Co-S/Ti mesh (h10=361 mV),[22] CP/Co-S (h10=363 mV)[1a] and pulse-electrodeposited nickel sulfide (h10=320 mV).[39] For analysis of the OER kinetics, Tafel plots of ED-CoS (1200s), ED-Co, Ti foil and IrO2 are obtained from the corresponding polarization curves. As shown in Figure 3b, the benchmark IrO2/C catalyst shows a Tafel slope of 40 mV dec-1 . The ED-CoS (1200s) catalyst reveals a Tafel slope of 55 mV dec-1 , which is greatly lower than that of ED-Co (99 mV dec-1 ) and bare Ti foil (179 mV dec-1 ), indicating the ED-CoS catalyst has the much faster electrode kinetics toward OER. The Tafel slope observed in our ED-CoS (1200s) catalyst is lower than other reported electrochemically synthe-

sized cobalt sulfide catalysts, such as Co-S/Ti mesh (64 mV dec-1 ) [22] and CP/Co-S (101 mV dec-1 ).[1a]

Figure 5. Schematic illustration of the electrochemical synthesis of CoS and the structural evolution of CoS with electrodeposition time.

In order to monitor the morphology evolution of electrodeposited CoS, the ED-CoS catalysts with different deposition time were prepared. As shown in Figure 4a, there is no nanosheet on Ti foil with an electrodeposition time of 0 s. When an electrodeposition time of 5 s is applied, the CoS nanosheets begin to emerge (Figure 4b). Further extending electrodeposition time to 15 s, the dendrites of Ti foil are fully covered with CoS nanosheets (Figure 4c). With an electrodeposition time of 30s, the CoS nanosheets full fill the space between Ti dendrites (Figure 4d). When the reaction time increases to 150s, many nanosheets interconnect randomly and assemble into nanoflower-like clusters, presenting a unique hierarchical structure (Figure 4e). When prolonging the electrodeposition time to 600s, the size and number of the flower-like clusters increase obviously (Figure 4f). The number of cobalt sulfide flower clusters reaches the highest value while retaining the hierarchical structure at an electrodeposition time of 1200s. However, when the electrodeposition time further rises to 1800s, the flower clusters disappears and the surface of electrodeposited cobalt sulfide becomes smooth (Figure 4g). When continue to increase the time to 2400s, the surface of the catalyst becomes dense spheres and the amount of nanosheets decreases rapidly (Figure 4h). Increasing electrodeposition time. the obtained cobalt sulfide reveals a smooth and dense surface. this phenomenon probably results from the diffusion limited transport reactants to the electrode surface. The overall synthetic strategy and the morphology evolution of electrodeposited CoS are schematically illustrated in Figure 5.

The electrocatalytic activity of ED-CoS catalysts at various electrodeposition time was investigated. As shown in Figure 6a, ED-CoS (0 s) exhibits poor OER activity, while ED-CoS (5 s) shows enhanced catalytic activity with a  $\eta_{10}$  of 580 mV. Further increasing electrodeposition time, the overpotentials to achieve

a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> decrease obviously, such as ED-CoS (15 s)  $\eta_{10} = 440$  mV, ED-CoS (30s)  $\eta_{10} = 400$  mV, ED-CoS (150s)  $\eta_{10} = 350 \text{ mV}$ , ED-CoS (600s)  $\eta_{10} = 320 \text{ mV}$  and ED-CoS (1200s)  $\eta_{10}$  = 310 mV. However, when the electrodeposition time exceeds 1200s, the OER performance is gradually declining, such as  $\eta_{10}$  for ED-CoS (1800s) and ED-CoS (2400s) as high as 330 and 340 mV, respectively. The corresponding Tafel slope for ED-CoS (0 s), ED-CoS (5 s), ED-CoS (15 s), ED-CoS (30s), ED-CoS (150s), ED-CoS (600s) and ED-CoS (1200s) electrodes are determined to be 179, 153, 95, 90, 77, 62 and 55 mV dec<sup>-1</sup> (Figure 6b), respectively, suggesting that the OER kinetics of the cobalt sulfide electrodes becomes faster and faster as increasing the electrodeposition time from 0 to 1200s. However, when extending electrodeposition time to 1800s and 2400s, the Tafel slope increases to 62 mV dec<sup>-1</sup> and 67 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. The overall variation trend of Tafel slope as the function of electrodeposition time is illustrated in Figure 6d. These results indicate that 1200s is the optimized electrodeposition time for synthesis of CoS with best catalytic performance.

To further understand the interesting phenomenon, we investigated the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) of the electrodeposited catalysts via the reported double-layer capacitance ( $C_{\rm cll}$ ) method. A potential window (0.70 ~ 0.80 V vs RHE) with no apparent Faradaic process occurring was selected to perform CV tests under various scan rates (50, 100, 200, 400, 600, 800 and 1000 mV s $^{-1}$ ), and the CV curves of EDCoS catalysts prepared at different electrodeposition time are shown in Figure S4. As known to all, double-layer current density (j) is equal to the product of scan rate ( $\nu$ ) and  $C_{\rm cll}$ , as given by the following expression:

The summary of Tafel slope and ECSA (d) as a function of electrodeposition time. Schematic illustration of the OER occurs on flower-like 3D hierarchical ED-CoS (e).

$$j = \nu C_{dl} \tag{2}$$

Thus the Cdl is the slope of j vs. n plot. Figure 6c displays a relation of double layer current density (Dj=ja - jc) vs. scan rates (v) for electrodes prepared with different electrodeposition time, of which the slopes correspond to Cdl. The Cdl of ED-CoS catalysts prepared at electrodeposition time of 0, 5, 15, 30, 150, 600, 1200, 1800 and 2400s are 0.137, 0.156, 0.180, 0.308, 0.340, 0.794, 1.050, 0.437 and 0.375 mF, respectively. Once the Cdl is obtained, the ECSA can be calculated by the following expression:

Where Cs is the specific capacitance, a typical value Cs= 0.04 mF cm-<sup>2</sup> was adopted in this work.[40] Accordingly, the ECSAs of ED-CoS prepared at electrodeposition time of 0, 5, 15, 30, 150, 600, 1200, 1800 and 2400s are calculated to be 1.71, 1.95, 2.25, 3.85, 4.25, 9.92, 13.09, 5.46 and 4.69 cm<sup>2</sup> , respectively. For better comparison, the ECSA as a function of electrodeposition time is presented in Figure 6d. With the electrodeposition time raising from 0 to 1200s, the ECSA increases gradually; but when the electrodeposition time exceeds 1200s, it decreases rapidly. Since the OER process occurs at the interface of electrocatalysts and electrolyte, the surface area of

catalysts is essential to the catalytic activities. The electrocatalytic activity (h<sup>10</sup> and Tafel slope) of the ED-CoS catalysts synthesized with different electrodeposition time has the similar variation trend to their ECSA, indicating that the OER activity of ED-CoS is greatly dominated by the surface area. We argue that the high performance of ED-CoS (1200s) is mainly contributed by its unique nanosheets-based flower-like 3D hierarchical structure, which creates a large reaction surface while allowing electrolyte accessing the reaction surface and the produced oxygen bubble escaping out for a fast electrode kinetics toward OER process. The enhancement mechanism is illustrated as in Figure 6e.

For practical applications, we conducted stability test of ED-CoS (1200s) catalyst. Chronoamperometric curve was recorded at 1.55 V vs. RHE (h=325 mV) in 1.0 M KOH solution (Figure 7). After a long period of 20 h, the OER current still keeps at 15 mA cm-2 , no obvious degradation compared to the initial stage, indicating its superior stability. The low cost and high catalytic activity as well as superb stability make ED-CoS (1200s) catalyst as a very promising candidate for practical applications.

# Conclusions

In brief, a facile synthesis approach was applied to fabricate a nanosheets-composed flower-like 3D hierarchical structure on Ti foil by electrodeposition method and the nanostructure effect on the catalysis toward OER was studied in detail. Results indicate that the unique nanostructured electrode offers large reaction surface area while allowing electrolyte accessing the reaction surface and the produced oxygen bubble escaping out for a fast electrode kinetics toward OER process. In this work, KSCN was first employed as the sulfur source for directly electrodepositing CoS, which plays the critical role in formation of the unique nanosheets-based flower structure for high electrocatalytic performance. In particular, ED-CoS (1200s) demonstrates the highest activity and superior stability, which requires a low overpotential of 310 to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm-. This work not only demonstrates a facile new approach to synthesize cobalt sulfide material, but also offers a very promising electrocatalyst toward OER application for mass-production of hydrogen via water electrolysis.

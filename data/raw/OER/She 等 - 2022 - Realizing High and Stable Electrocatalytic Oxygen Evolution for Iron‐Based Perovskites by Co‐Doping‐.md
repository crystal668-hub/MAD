**Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a vital electrochemical process for various energy conversion and fuel production technologies. Co/Ni-rich perovskite oxides are extensively studied as promising alternatives to precious-metal catalysts; however, low-cost and earth-abundant iron (Fe)-rich perovskites are rarely investigated to date due to their poor activity and durability. This study reports an Fe-rich Sr0.95Ce0.05Fe0.9Ni0.1O3−***δ* **(SCFN) perovskite oxide with minor Ce/Ni co-doping in A/B sites as a high-performance OER electrocatalyst. Impressively, SCFN shows more than an order of magnitude enhancement in mass-specific activity compared to the SrFeO3−***δ* **(SF) parent oxide, and delivers an attractive small overpotential of 340 mV at 10 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> , outperforming many Co/Ni-rich perovskite oxides ever reported. Additionally, SCFN displays robust operational durability with negligible activity loss under alkaline OER conditions. The increased activity and stability of SCFN can be ascribed to co-doping-induced synergistic promotion between structural and electronic modulation, where Ce doping facilitates the formation of a 3D corner-sharing cubic structure and Ni doping gives rise to strong electronic interactions between active sites, which is key to achieving a highly active long-life catalyst. Importantly, this strategy is universal and can be extended to other Fe-based parent perovskite oxides with high structural diversity.**

# **1. Introduction**

Efficient electrochemical energy storage and conversion technologies offer a sustainable pathway in pursuit of rapid economic development. Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is an essential anodic reaction in water electrolysis, carbon/nitrogen fixation, and rechargeable metal–air batteries.[1–4] However, due to the complex proton-coupled electron transfer process, it possesses inherently sluggish kinetics that require high overpotentials to proceed at moderate rates, necessitating electrocatalyst involvement.[5] Currently, preciousmetal-based catalysts (e.g., IrO2 and RuO2) are typically regarded as state-of-the-art OER electrocatalysts, but their high cost, scarcity, and poor operational stability severely hinder their practical use.[6,7] This challenge has spurred an upsurge in the study of transition metal oxides as efficient earth-abundant and low-cost OER electrocatalysts.[8]

Recently, transition metal oxides with perovskite structures (*AB*O3, *A* = rare and alkaline earth metal, *B* = transition metal) have attracted great interest for OER catalysis because of their high intrinsic activities and large compositional/structural tunability.[9–11] Fe-based perovskites are particularly appealing for practical use as Fe is one of the most naturally abundant elements in the Earth's crust and cheaper and less toxic than other transition elements (e.g., Co/Ni/Mn).[12–14] To the best of our knowledge, although Fe is well known for its key role as a dopant/impurity in Co/Ni-based oxides for the OER, very few Fe-rich perovskite oxides have been well investigated till date as highly active OER catalysts.[15–21] This is possibly because of their intrinsically low OER reactivity, as indicated by Trasatti's "volcano" curve and MOH bond strength.[22,23] Moreover, the poor durability of Fe-based perovskite oxides under harsh OER conditions is another serious issue. According to the Pourbaix diagrams, Fe-based oxides are thermodynamically unstable and easily transform into soluble FeO4 <sup>2</sup><sup>−</sup> in neutral/basic aqueous solutions under anodic potentials.[24] Additionally, A-site metal ion leaching appears to be unavoidable for the perovskite oxide family owing to the ionic characteristics of A-site cations.[25–27] Nonetheless, some studies have attempted to enhance the electrocatalytic performance of Fe-based perovskites.[28–31] For example, Dai et al. used the template method to construct a 3D ordered macroporous framework for LaFeO3 perovskite, providing increased catalytic active sites and enhanced mass transport ability for OER electrocatalysis.[30] Yagi et al. synthesized a quadruple perovskite CaCu3Fe4O12 using a high-pressure method and found that the unusual covalent bonding network of FeOCu can improve the catalytic activity and structural stability.[31] Despite these efforts, the reported OER performance of Fe-based perovskites is significantly inferior to that of Co/Nibased perovskites; moreover, the adopted synthetic processes (such as hard template and ultrahigh pressure) are always complex and not ideal for large-scale fabrication. Thus, simple and effective strategies are urgently needed for developing Fe-based perovskites with high activity and robust durability.

According to the Sabatier's principle, the binding energy between the substrate and the reactants, intermediates, and products is the key catalytic factor underlying the activity of OER catalysts.[9,32] The methods used to optimize binding energy like tuning the compositions, introducing strain, defect and vacancy, engineering the morphology, and hybridizing with strongly coupled supports, are well-established.[4] However, elucidating the factors that simultaneously control activity and stability is still lacking, because there is generally an inverse relationship between activity and stability.[26,33,34] Accordingly, balancing the stability and activity of OER catalysts is a greatly valuable but very challenging project.

Here, we report Sr0.95Ce0.05Fe0.9Ni0.1O3−*δ* (SCFN), an Fe-based perovskite oxide prepared by co-doping small amounts of SrFeO3−*δ* (SF) parent oxide with Ce and Ni, as a highly active and stable OER electrocatalyst in alkaline media. The SCFN perovskite crystallizes in a cubic structure with regular cornersharing (Fe/Ni)O6 octahedra connected in a 3D network, which differs from the distorted tetragonal structure of the SF parent oxide. Remarkably, SCFN exhibits an exceptional OER activity that is at least one order of magnitude higher than that of SF, and an extremely low overpotential of 340 mV at 10 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2 in 0.1 m KOH, which is superior to that reported for many stateof-the-art Co/Ni/Fe-based perovskite catalysts. In addition, the activity loss for the SCFN during continuous 500-cycle or 30-h OER is negligible, indicating the robust operation durability of the SCFN for the OER. By combined experimental analysis, the less-distorted 3D cubic structure and higher metal–oxygen covalency in SCFN is found to be responsible for the improved activity and stability relative to pristine SF. More significantly, such an A/B-sites co-doping strategy with simultaneous modulation of the crystal structure and electronic structure to balance the stability and activity is universal and applicable for other Fe-based parent perovskite oxides, such as CaFeO3−*δ* (CF), LaFeO3−*δ* (LF), and BaFeO3−*δ* (BF). This work opens up the door to design high-performance Fe-based catalysts for water oxidation.

# **2. Results and Discussion**

In this study, parent SrFeO3−*δ* (SF) perovskite oxide was selected as the representative model considering that its fully oxidized form (*δ* = 0) has comparable O 2*p*-band centre and *M*O (*M* = transition metal) covalency with the highly active Co-based SrCoO3 perovskite.[27] We synthesized SF, Ce-doped Sr0.95Ce0.05FeO3−*δ* (SCF), and Ce/Ni-co-doped SCFN samples using a simple sol–gel method, which can be easily used for large scale preparation. It is noted that the fully oxidized SF perovskite is unstable under ambient conditions and that oxygen vacancies always exist.[35] In tetragonal SF, distorted FeO6 octahedra and FeO5 square pyramids are alternatively arranged, which construct a discontinuous 2D layer structure. Minor Ce/Ni co-doping in the A/B sites of the SF structure induces an apparent phase structure transition (**Figure 1**a). Contrary to SF, cubic SCFN oxide with regular (Fe/Ni)O6 octahedral subunits forms a 3D strong-connectivity network through a corner-sharing motif. The phase compositions and structures were initially characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD). SF and SCF show pure phase structures, while a minor NiO phase is found in SCFN (Figure 1b). In addition, the diffraction peaks for the co-doped SCFN shift to higher angles relative to those for SCF, implying partial B-site substitution of the larger Fe ions by smaller Ni ions. Based on Rietveld refinement, the main phase structures of SF, SCF, and SCFN crystallize space groups of I4/mmm, Pm-3m, and Pm-3m, respectively (Figure 1c,d; Figure S1 and Tables S1 and S2, Supporting information). Notably, the quantity of minor NiO phase is estimated to be ≈1.2 wt% from a quantitative Rietveld refinement in SCFN, and accordingly, it is inferred that the actual quantity of Ni atoms doped into the B-site lattice of SCFN is ≈6.9 at%. Point energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) results also indicate that the atomic ratio of Ni in the B-site of the host perovskite is ≈5.9%, similar to that obtained using XRD refinement analysis (Figure S2, Supporting information). Elemental mapping images show that Ni in SCFN is not only homogeneously distributed in the host perovskite, but also forms several NiO nanoparticles (Figure 1e). Highresolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images further confirms the formation of host perovskite and second NiO phases in SCFN, which are strongly coupled with each other (Figure 1f). The interplanar distances of 0.28 and 0.24 nm

match the (110) and (111) planes of the host perovskite phase and second minor NiO phase, respectively, which was verified using fast Fourier transformation (FFT) patterns (Figure 1g,h). In addition, the particle sizes in the SF, SCF, and SCFN samples are at the micron scale due to the high calcination temperature for phase formation, and the surface areas are ≈3 m2 g−<sup>1</sup> (Figure S3, Supporting information).

The OER electrocatalytic activities of the synthesized catalysts were evaluated using typical thin-film rotating disk electrode (RDE) in O2-saturated 0.1 m KOH.[9,36] All electrode potentials reported were referenced to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE, Figure S4, Supporting information) and *iR*-corrected, where *i* is the current and *R* is the electrolyte resistance. **Figure 2**a summarizes the polarization curves for SF, SCF, and SCFN catalysts, which show that SCFN has the lowest overpotential and largest current density. In particular, SCFN shows a very small overpotential (*η*10) of 340 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm−<sup>2</sup> , which is much lower than that for SF (480 mV) and SCF (390 mV). As mass activity (MA, normalized to the mass of catalyst) is an important metric for practical application, and specific activity (SA, normalized to the electrochemical active surface area of catalyst, Figure S5, Supporting information) reflects the intrinsic activity of the catalyst, we compared the MA and SA for electrocatalysts at 400 mV overpotential. The MA and SA for SCFN are 169 A g−<sup>1</sup> and 1.6 mA cm−<sup>2</sup> ECSA, respectively, which are approximately 15-fold and 10-fold higher than those for the SF parent oxide (11 A g<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> and 0.16 mA cm−<sup>2</sup> ECSA, respectively; Figure 2b). Furthermore, SCFN possesses a small Tafel slope, revealing a high reaction rate during the OER cycles (Figure 2c). In addition, we investigated the effect of the concentrations of the B-site Ni ions on OER activity and found that SCFN with 10% Ni doping shows **www.advancedsciencenews.com www.afm-journal.de**

the best catalytic activity among the Sr0.95Ce0.05Fe1−*x*Ni*x*O3−*<sup>δ</sup>* (SCFN*x*, *x* = 0.05, 0.1, and 0.2) catalysts (Figures S6 and S7, Supporting information). Moreover, the performance of the Ni-doped catalyst SrFe0.9Ni0.1O3-*δ* (SFN) is inferior to that of the Ce/Ni-co-doped SCFN, revealing the important role of A-site Ce doping (Figures S8 and S9, Supporting information). It is noteworthy that the minor NiO phase has little effect on the electrocatalytic activity, which can be demonstrated by the similar OER activity of the SCF and the physical mixture of SCF and NiO (SCF + NiO, Figure S10, Supporting information). The extraordinary OER electrocatalytic activity of SCFN is superior to that of most well-known transition metal oxides, including highly active Co-, Ni-, and Mn-based perovskite oxides (Figure 2d; Table S3, Supporting information).

Aside from the catalytic activity, stability in a hostile electrochemical environment is another key parameter in practical catalytic applications. **Figure 3**a–c shows continuous 500-cycle cyclic voltammogram (CV) scans for the SF, SCF, and SCFN catalysts. The OER current density of the parent SF decreases greatly with continuous CV scans. In contrast, the changes in CV curves for SCFN were negligible, suggesting excellent operation durability of SCFN for OER, which was also confirmed by the potential difference (*ΔV*). For example, the *ΔV* at 3 m cm−<sup>2</sup> for SCFN is 0.9 mV, which is much lower than that for SF (102 mV) and SCF (51 mV) (Figure 3d). Besides, the Ce/Ni-co-doped SCFN also exhibits better stability compared to the Ni-doped SFN, indicating that the Ce doping is beneficial to stability during OER (Figure S11, Supporting information). To obtain an in-depth understanding of the reaction mechanism and kinetics, the Tafel slopes at every 100 cycles over 500 cycles are presented in Figure 3e. For pristine SF, the Tafel slope increases significantly from 69 to 134 mV dec<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> , revealing that the rate-limiting step is fundamentally changed from OO bond formation to OH species deprotonation and that the OER rate falls.[37–39] Contrary to that for SF, the Tafel slope for SCFN remains nearly unchanged after 500 cycles at 60 mV dec<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> , confirming the good electrocatalytic stability of SCFN. Additionally, we performed chronopotentiometry tests for SF, SCF, and SCFN catalysts. SF displays a sharp loss after a short activation period, similar to previously reported Fe-based oxides (Figure 3f).[40,41] This behaviour may be related to the intrinsic poor electronic conductivity and instability of Fe-based catalysts. At high overpotentials, the electronic conductivity of Fe-based catalysts increases, which improves the performance, but the long-term durability decreases due to dissolved species FeO4 <sup>2</sup>− formation.[40,41] In contrast, SCFN sustains 30 h OER operation without degradation in performance. Thus, we conclude that the low-cost Fe-rich SCFN is an excellent OER catalyst that satisfies both activity and durability.

However, the mechanism of Ce and Ni co-doping-mediated improved electrocatalytic performance of SF for OER remains non-elucidated. Therefore, we initially investigated the surface structures and compositions of SF, SCF, and SCFN after OER through HRTEM and EDX characterization (**Figure 4**a–d). An evident ≈5–10 nm thick amorphous layer with significantly lower surface Sr content relative to the bulk composition was observed for the parent SF oxide, implying the severe dissolution of surface Sr ions, as also reported previously.[27] However, a well-crystallized surface without amorphization and much less Sr dissolution was found for Ce/Ni co-doped SCFN, indicating **www.advancedsciencenews.com www.afm-journal.de**

good structural stability of SCFN during the OER. Interestingly, Ce-doped SCF is also more stable with negligible amorphization and a lower Sr surface–bulk change ratio than pristine SF, highlighting the important role of Ce doping on the enhanced stability. The partial substitution of Sr ions (1.44 Å) with smaller Ce cations (1.14 Å) on the A-site can shift the Goldschmidt tolerance factor (*t*) of the parent SF to be closer to 1, preferentially forming a cubic structure. Contrary to the discontinuous 2D layer structure of SF, the less-distorted FeO6 octahedra and 3D strong-connectivity network in the cubic structure can suppress alkaline-earth element leaching and crystal lattice collapse during the OER, thus benefiting stability.[42,43] Furthermore, we measured the concentrations of leached Sr/Fe ions in the electrolyte after OER using inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES). The Sr/Fe ion concentration for cubic SCF and SCFN were lower than that for tetragonal SF, demonstrating the improved stability of the cubic structure (Figure 4e).

Next, we examined the effect of electronic structures using soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy (sXAS). The sXAS spectrum measurement in total electron yield (TEY) mode with probing depth of ≈5 nm is sensitive to the surface electronic structure.[44–46] The XAS spectra for Ce-*M*4,5 (**Figure 5**a) are similar to that for CeO2 and nearly identical between SCF and SCFN, implying no distinct change in the surface Ce4<sup>+</sup> valence state for SCF and SCFN. It is well-known that increasing the valence of Fe from 3+ to 4+ will enhance the FeO covalency; however, the additional hole is located mainly at the O 2p orbitals and not at the Fe4<sup>+</sup> 3d orbitals.[47] In such cases, the O-*K* XAS spectrum is more sensitive to the additional hole than the Fe-*L*2,3 edges. Usually, as the valence state of Fe increases, a shift toward lower energy and enhanced spectral weight appears at the O *K*-edge.[48,49] The first pre-edge peak (at 528.3 eV) for SF shifts to lower energy by 1.6 eV relative to that for Fe2O3 and has a dominant spectral weight, suggesting a mainly Fe4<sup>+</sup> valence state in SF (Figure 5b). The spectral weight of the first pre-edge peak of SF decreases slightly than that of SCF, while the spectral weight increases at ≈530 eV, which is associated with the reduced Fe<sup>4</sup><sup>+</sup> content and the presence of Ce 4f states mixed with O 2p states.[50] However, compared with that for SCF, the spectral weight of the first pre-edge increases for SCFN, indicating the increased degree of metal–oxygen covalency and enhanced Fe<sup>4</sup><sup>+</sup> and Ni<sup>3</sup><sup>+</sup> ion concentrations. The pre-edge peak for the latter is located at the same energy band for LaNiO3. [51] Additionally, the occurrence of Ni<sup>3</sup><sup>+</sup> in SCFN is reflected by the higher peak intensity of SCFN compared to that of NiO at ≈851.2 eV (Figure 5c).[52,53] Moreover, the Fe-*L*3 edge peak for SCFN slightly shifts to higher energy compared with that for SCF, manifesting a higher Fe valence state for SCFN compared to that for SCF (Figure 5d). The increased oxidation states for Fe/Ni after Ni incorporation into Fe sites in SCFN suggest certain electronic interactions between Fe and Ni ions.[54–56] The electronic interaction in SCFN was also revealed through CV measurements, where the Ni2+/3<sup>+</sup> peak at ≈1.4 V shifts cathodically with increasing Ni content from 5% (SCFN0.05) to 10% (SCFN) (Figure S12, Supporting information).[18,21] The high metal–oxygen covalency and high-valence Fe4+ and Ni3<sup>+</sup> ions in SCFN are beneficial for improving OER activity by promoting charge transfer between the active sites and OER intermediates, which was also demonstrated by the decreased

**Figure 5.** a) Ce-*M*4,5 sXAS spectra for SCF, SCFN, and CeO2. b) O-*K* sXAS spectra for SF, SCF, SCFN, Fe2O3, and LaNiO3. c) Ni-*L*3 sXAS spectra for SCFN and NiO. d) Fe-*L*3 sXAS spectra for SF, SCF, SCFN, and Fe2O3. e) Schematic illustration of the beneficial factors contributing to high OER electrocatalytic performance in SCFN.

charge transfer resistance for SCFN using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements (Figure S13, Supporting information).[57–59] In addition, high metal-oxygen covalency has also been reported to enhance OER stability.[31,32] Thus, it is concluded that the high OER performance of SCFN (including activity and stability) mainly benefits from the codoping-induced structural and electronic effects, where A-site Ce doping facilitates 3D corner-sharing cubic structure formation and B-site Ni doping causes a strong electronic interaction between Fe and Ni sites (Figure 5e). Specifically, when A-site metal ions (Sr and/or Ce) tend to leach from SCFN due to ionic characteristics, the 3D strong-connectivity (Fe/Ni)O6 framework and high metal–oxygen covalency suppress excessive ion dissolution and protect the perovskite from structural oscillations and surface amorphization. However, avoiding severe leaching of Sr ions from the parent SF oxide is difficult due to the discontinuous 2D layer structure, thus causing a loss of the catalytic active site Fe and subsequent collapse of the perovskite structure.

To examine whether such a co-doping strategy is versatile for enhancing the activity and stability of other Fe-based perovskite oxides, three other Fe-based parent perovskites with different crystal structures, namely, CaFeO3−*δ* (CF), LaFeO3−*<sup>δ</sup>* (LF), and BaFeO3−*δ* (BF), were selected for study. CF, LF, and BF can be categorized into three distinct structure groups in terms of the relative strength of connectivity between FeO6 octahedra: CF with alternating FeO6 octahedra and FeO4 tetrahedra is classified as a weak-connectivity group, LF with distorted corner-shared FeO6 octahedra belongs to the intermediate connectivity group, and BF with the face-sharing FeO6 configuration is categorized as a strong-connectivity group. Following our design principle, La, Sr, and Ba are doped into the A-site of CF, LF, and BF to form cubic structures, respectively, while Fe cations at the B site are partially substituted with Ni to produce FeNi electronic interactions. As shown by the XRD patterns, La0.5Ca0.5Fe0.9Ni0.1O3-*δ* (LCFN), La0.5Sr0.5Fe0.9Ni0.1O3−*<sup>δ</sup>* (LSFN), and La0.05Ba0.95Fe0.9Ni0.1O3-*δ* (LBFN) perovskites show pure cubic crystal structures without additional impurity phases (**Figure 6**a–c). The OER electrocatalytic activity and stability of LCFN and LSFN are higher than those of the parent CF and LF, demonstrating the applicability of this strategy (Figure 6d,e,g,h). The OER electrocatalytic activity of parent BF oxide can also be enhanced by La/Ni co-doping, but the stability decreases (Figure 6f,i). The decreased electrocatalytic stability of LBFN compared to that of parent BF may be explained by the more stable face-sharing geometry structure in BF during OER catalysis than the corner-shared structure in cubic LBFN.[42]

# **3. Conclusion**

In summary, an Fe-rich perovskite oxide was developed as a highly active and stable OER electrocatalyst via a co-dopinginduced structural and electronic modulation strategy. Such materials can be easily prepared using a facile and scalable sol– gel method. Benefiting from a Ce/Ni co-doping-induced cubic structure and electronic interaction, the OER electrocatalytic activity of Sr0.95Ce0.05Fe0.9Ni0.1O3−*δ* (SCFN) is at least an order of magnitude higher than that of the parent SrFeO3−*δ* (SF) perovskite, and an overpotential of only 340 mV achieves a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> , which is superior to that of most Co/Ni-based transition oxides reported thus far. In addition, the SCFN displays robust operational stability in continuous 500-cycle or 30-h OER measurements. Furthermore, such a strategy for simultaneously promoting OER activity and stability is applicable for other Fe-based parent perovskites with different structures. This work uncovers the important role of co-doping and phase structure (cubic structure with less distorted FeO6 octahedra and 3D strong connectivity network) on catalytic activity and stability and opens up a new avenue for developing efficient Fe-based electrocatalysts.

# **4. Experimental Section**

*Catalyst Synthesis*: SrFeO3−*δ* (SF), Sr0.95Ce0.05FeO3−*δ* (SCF), and Sr0.95Ce0.05Fe0.9Ni0.1O3−*δ* (SCFN) samples were prepared through a simple sol–gel method. First, stoichiometric Sr(CH2COOH)2, Ce(NO3)3•6H2O, Fe(NO3)3•9H2O, and Ni(NO3)2•6H2O were dissolved in deionized water. Then, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and citrate acid (CA) as complexing agents (EDTA: CA: metal ions = 1:2:1) were dissolved in an ammonium solution, added slowly to the above solution, and heated at 90 °C under stirring to evaporate the water, thus yielding a gel. The obtained gel was pre-treated at 200 °C for 12 h in an electric oven to obtain a solid precursor. Finally, SF, SCF, and SCFN samples were obtained after calcinating the solid precursors at 1000 °C for 10 h in air. A similar procedure was also adopted to prepare Sr0.95Ce0.05Fe1<sup>−</sup>*x*Ni*x*O3−*<sup>δ</sup>* (SCFN*x*, where *x* = 0.05 and 0.2), SrFe0.9Ni0.1O3−*δ* (SFN), CaFeO3−*<sup>δ</sup>* (CF), LaFeO3−*δ* (LF), BaFeO3−*δ* (BF), La0.5Ca0.5Fe0.9Ni0.1O3−*δ* (LCFN), La0.5Sr0.5Fe0.9Ni0.1O3−*δ* (LSFN), and La0.05Ba0.95Fe0.9Ni0.1O3−*δ* (LBFN) samples; however, LF and LSFN were calcinated at 800 °C, while BF and LBFN were calcinated at 1200 °C.

*Physicochemical Characterization*: XRD patterns were acquired using an X-ray diffractometer equipped with Cu K*α* radiation (Smartlab 3 kW). Rietveld refinements for XRD were conducted to obtain detailed structural and compositional information using TOPAS V6 software. HRTEM images and elemental mapping were recorded using an electron microscope operated at 200 kV (Tecnai G2 F20 S-TWIN). SEM images were obtained using a scanning electron microscope (Hitachi S-4800). The specific surface areas were estimated through nitrogen adsorption– desorption measurements at 77 K (BELSORP II). The dissolved metal ions in solution were collected using an ICP-MS instrument (Varian Vista-Pto). Ce-*M*4,5, O-*K,* Ni-*L*3, and Fe-*L*3 soft XAS spectra were recorded at TLS BL11A of NSRRC in Taiwan. The corresponding spectra were calibrated by the photon energy of CeO2, NiO, NiO, and Fe2O3 single crystals.

*Electrode Preparation and Electrochemical Evaluation*: The OER performance of the catalysts was assessed using a CHI 760 electrochemistry workstation. Working electrode: catalyst-loaded glassy carbon (GC), Reference electrode: Hg/HgO, and Counter electrode: graphite rod. To obtain a catalyst-modified GC, 10 mg catalyst and 10 mg conductive carbon (Super P Li) were dispersed in 1 mL absolute ethanol and sonicated for 10 min. Next, 100 µL 5 wt% Nafion solution was introduced as a binder to the above solution and sonicated again for 20 min. Then, 5 µL homogeneously dispersed catalyst ink was drop-cast on the GC substrate surface (0.196 cm2), generating a mass loading of ≈0.232 mg cmcatalyst<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup>

The OER testing process was performed in accordance with previously reported protocols.[60,61] Prior to electrochemical measurements, the electrolyte was bubbled with O2 for 30 min to ensure O2/OH<sup>−</sup> equilibrium at 1.23 V. The catalyst-loaded working electrode was activated by running cyclic voltammetry (CV) until reproducible curves were obtained. The electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) was estimated by running CV in a non-faradaic potential window (0.3–0.4 V vs Hg/HgO) with varying scan rates ranging from 10 to 120 mV s<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> .

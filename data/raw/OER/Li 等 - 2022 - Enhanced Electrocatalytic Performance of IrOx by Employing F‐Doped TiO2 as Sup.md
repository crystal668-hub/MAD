# Enhanced Electrocatalytic Performance of IrO<sub>x</sub> by Employing F-Doped TiO<sub>2</sub> as Support towards Acidic Oxygen Evolution Reaction

Guoqiang Li,\*[a] Xiaojie Xu,[a] Huan Liu,[b] Xin Yang,[a] and Meng-Chang Lin[a]

F-doped  ${\rm TiO_2}$  is developed through simple solid-phase synthesis and innovatively employed to support  ${\rm IrO_x}$  nanoparticles towards acidic oxygen evolution reaction. Benefiting from the high electrical conductivity, improved electronic interaction, and well dispersing/anchoring effects of F-TiO<sub>2</sub>, the  ${\rm IrO_x/F-TiO_2}$  electrocatalyst requires only 272 mV overpotential to achieve

10 mA cm $^{-2}$ , accompanied with the mass activity of 320.2 A g $_{\rm lr}^{-1}$ @1.55 V. Moreover, the single cell voltages are only 1.662 V@1 A cm $^{-2}$  and 1.749 V@2 A cm $^{-2}$  when employing IrO $_{\rm x}$ /F-TiO $_{\rm 2}$  as the anode catalyst, and operates steadily for at least 240 h. Hence, low overpotential, enhanced stability and prominent catalyst utilization are simultaneously realized.

#### Introduction

Water electrolysis is a clean and sustainable technique for green hydrogen production, as long as the electricity used are generated from renewable energies (solar, wind, hydroelectric power, etc.).<sup>[1]</sup> Due to the merits of high current density, high product purity, compact system design and good adaptability to intermittent power input, solid polymer electrolyte water electrolysis (SPEWE) has become the research focus.<sup>[2]</sup> The energy conversion efficiency and durability of SPEWE are mainly dominated by the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and it depends intensively on the noble Ir metal.<sup>[2a,3]</sup> Hence, reducing the Ir consumption without compromising the catalytic performance is highly important.

The supported Ir-based catalysts possess several advantages including reducing the Ir consumption, modulating the electronic interaction, and manipulating the dispersing/stabilizing effects on  $\rm IrO_x$  nanoparticles to enhance the catalytic performance. However, it still remains a crucial issue to explore suitable corrosion-resistant and highly conductive support candidate.

Highly oxidizing/corrosive circumstances in anode make the conductive carbon support materials widely used in other electrocatalytic systems unstable because of their readily corroded feature. At present, acid-resistant transition metal compounds based on Ti and Sn elements have been developed

and regarded as the most representative supports for OER. [5b,6] Pure TiO<sub>2</sub> and SnO<sub>2</sub> hold robust stability in the SPEWE conditions, commercial Umicore catalyst (75 wt%, IrO<sub>2</sub>/TiO<sub>2</sub>) was also developed. However, extremely low electrical conductivity is still the bottleneck that urgently to be solved. Consequently, nonstoichiometric and heteroatom-doped Ti/Sn oxides are generally reported. The electrical conductivity of TiO<sub>2</sub> is generally below 10<sup>-4</sup> S cm<sup>-1</sup>, by contrast, Ti<sub>4</sub>O<sub>7</sub> can dramatically increase to ultrahigh 10<sup>3</sup> S cm<sup>-1,[7]</sup> Gago et al. applied Ti<sub>4</sub>O<sub>7</sub> to support Ir and obtained a higher mass activity (4.2  $Ag_{lr}^{-1}$ ) than that of Ir-black (1.6  $Ag_{Ir}^{-1}$ ) at 1.48 V, indicating the improved catalyst utilization.<sup>[8]</sup> Hu et al. prepared Nb-doped TiO<sub>2</sub> (Nb<sub>0.05</sub>Ti<sub>0.95</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) to support IrO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles, apart from the enhanced stability, the mass activity of 471 Ag<sub>IrO2</sub><sup>-1</sup>@1.6 V was approximately 2.37 times of the unsupported IrO2 with 198 Ag<sub>IrO2</sub><sup>-1</sup>. For SnO<sub>2</sub>, antimony tin oxide (ATO) prepared through Sb doping is the most commonly investigated support material. Böhm et al. synthesized macroporous ATO of 3.6 S cm<sup>-1</sup>, significantly higher than that of SnO<sub>2</sub>  $(3.8*10^{-4} \,\mathrm{S\,cm^{-1}})$ , the mass activity was as high as 63 Ag<sub>Ir</sub><sup>-1</sup>@1.53 V after supporting IrO<sub>x</sub>, accompanied with enhanced stability. [10] Strasser et al. employed ATO to support Ir nanodendrites, the corresponding mass activity reached 70 Ag<sub>ir</sub><sup>-1</sup>@1.51 V, and the stability significantly surpassed the unsupported Ir counterpart.[11] As the generally investigated metal nitride, TiN shows promising support effect. Xing et al. discovered that the electrical conductivity of TiN reached 28.18 S cm<sup>-1</sup>, IrO<sub>2</sub>@Ir/TiN catalyst showed 2.32 times higher mass activity (480.4 Ag<sub>ir</sub><sup>-1</sup>@1.6 V) of Ir-black, and extraordinary reaction stability.[12] Subsequently, Hu et al. also verified that TiN dramatically improved the catalyst utilization of TiN/IrO2, the mass activity climbed to 874 A  $g_{IrO2}^{-1}$ @1.6 V.<sup>[4]</sup>

Except for the metal-doped TiO<sub>2</sub>, non-metal such as F, N, B, P can also act as the dopants and generally applied in the photocatalytic systems. Xu et al. prepared F-TiO<sub>2</sub> by introducing NH<sub>4</sub>F as the F source, which showed enhanced photocatalytic activity for the degradation of phenol.<sup>[13]</sup> Chevalier et al. also developed F-TiO<sub>2</sub> through emulsions method and showed

apparently higher efficiency for the photocatalytic degradation of nitrobenzene. [14] Saini et al. synthesized N-TiO<sub>2</sub> and B-TiO<sub>2</sub> by a sol-gel route and confirmed the effectiveness on the photocatalytic degradation of these emerging micro-pollutants. [15] O'Shea et al. co-doped TiO<sub>2</sub> with N, F and P, the photocatalytic activity of this modified TiO<sub>2</sub> to produce hydroxyl radicals under ultra violet (UV) and visible light irradiation can be improved effectively. [16] These achievements mentioned-above mainly resulted from the decreased band-gap and the red-shift of light absorption profile to the visible region of TiO<sub>2</sub> through non-metal doping.

Herein, F-TiO $_2$  is synthesized by reacting TiO $_2$  with NH $_4$ F, subsequently, IrO $_x$ -based catalysts were obtained through a refluxing reduction method, in which ethylene glycol (EG) and hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) act as the dispersing and reducing agents (Figure S1), respectively. Research confirms that the F-doping procedure can dramatically improve the catalyst utilization and catalytic performance towards OER.

#### **Results and Discussion**

Varying F-doping atomic contents of 0.86, 1.97, 1.81 and 1.53 at % were acquired through modulating the mass ratio of TiO<sub>2</sub>: NH<sub>4</sub>F (Figure S2). The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) measurements show that the F-TiO<sub>2</sub> support with the highest F content of 1.97 at% performs prominent catalytic activity (Figure S3). The electrical conductivities of F-TiO<sub>2</sub> and undoped TiO<sub>2</sub> supports were investigated by the four-point probe method, F-TiO<sub>2</sub> (F: 1.97 at%) reaches 0.28 S cm<sup>-1</sup>, apparently higher than those of 0.05 (F: 0.86 at%), 0.21 (F: 1.81 at%), 0.13 (F: 1.53 at%) and 7.9×10<sup>-6</sup> (undoped TiO<sub>2</sub>) Scm<sup>-1</sup>, the significant effect of the F-doping procedure on improving the electrical conductivity of TiO<sub>2</sub> is undoubtable. As reported by Giamello et al, Fdoping induces the formation of reduced Ti<sup>3+</sup> centers that localize the extra electron in a  $t_{2g}$  orbital of Ti, the electron lies a few tenths of an electron volt below the bottom of the conduction band, the width of the forbidden band is shortened and the electrical conductivity is bound to improve. [17] Hence, electrically conductive path is favorable to form to effectively drive the reaction. Subsequently, taking F-TiO<sub>2</sub> with the highest (1.97 at%) and lowest (0.86 at%) F contents as the research targets, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) characterizations were implemented (Figure S4). Similar morphology characteristics appear with irregular particles aggregated to some extent, indicating that the varying F contents have no apparent effect on the morphology of F-TiO<sub>2</sub>. Based on the results mentioned above, F-TiO<sub>2</sub> (F: 1.97 at%) was employed to act as the support in the subsequent experiments.

The crystal structure was proved by the X-ray diffraction (XRD) technology, and Figure S5 shows the patterns of TiO<sub>2</sub> and F-TiO<sub>2</sub>. Apparently, these two supports exhibit common diffraction peaks and correspond to the anatase phase of TiO<sub>2</sub>.<sup>[18]</sup> Moreover, the main peak (101) of F-TiO<sub>2</sub> is slightly shifted to a higher diffraction angle compared with TiO<sub>2</sub> (inset of Figure S5), indicating that F is successfully incorporated into

the  $TiO_2$  lattice.  $N_2$  adsorption/desorption isotherms were measured to compare the specific surface areas between F-TiO $_2$  and  $TiO_2$  (Figure S6), 15.3 m $^2g^{-1}$  for F-TiO $_2$  is significantly lower than 32.8 m $^2g^{-1}$  for  $TiO_2$ , mainly resulted from the growth and aggregation of the particles under the high-temperature treatment in this solid-phase synthesis.

The XRD patterns of  $IrO_x/F-TiO_2$ ,  $IrO_x/TiO_2$  and  $IrO_x$  catalysts are shown in Figure 1a. All samples exhibit common crystal diffraction facets of (111), (200), (220) and (311), corresponding to the cubic phase of  $Ir.^{[11,19]}$  In addition, diffraction peaks belonging to anatase phase  $TiO_2$  are also apparently distinguished for the supported samples.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to research the surface information. Typical Ir, Ti and O orbits have emerged in the XPS survey spectra (Figure S7a), however, F element is hardly to recognize due to the low doping content. When transferred to the spectra of F1s orbit (Figure 1b), the apparent F 1s peak verifies the existence of F element in IrO<sub>x</sub>/F-TiO<sub>2</sub>. By contrast, F 1s peak is unrecognizable in IrO<sub>x</sub>/TiO<sub>2</sub> due to the lack of F-doping procedure. According to Figure 1c, the Ir 4f orbits for the supported catalysts all negatively shifted to lower electronic binding energy direction compared with pure IrOx, implying the electron-transfer procedure from F-TiO<sub>2</sub> and TiO<sub>2</sub> to IrO<sub>x</sub>. Specifically, the binding energy of Ir 4f<sub>7/2</sub> orbit of IrO<sub>x</sub>/F-TiO<sub>2</sub> is 61.08 eV, lower by 0.15 and 0.25 eV than those of IrO<sub>x</sub>/ TiO<sub>2</sub> and IrO<sub>x</sub> (Table S1), respectively. Subsequently, the Ir 4f spectra were deconvolved to obtain Ir<sup>0</sup> (4f<sub>7/2</sub>/4f<sub>5/2</sub> orbits) and Ir<sup>4+</sup>  $(4f_{7/2}/4f_{5/2})$  orbits) species (Figure S7b-d), the corresponding contents are shown in Table S1. As expected, the content of Ir<sup>0</sup> species is the highest for IrO<sub>x</sub>/F-TiO<sub>2</sub> (67.1%), mainly resulted from the most significant electronic interaction. Furthermore, the contents of Ir<sup>4+</sup> species lie between 32.9 and 35.8%, demonstrating the formation of a certain amount of Ir metal oxide component on the surface.

TEM images depict the morphology characteristics of IrO<sub>v</sub>/F-TiO<sub>2</sub> (Figure 1d), IrO<sub>x</sub>/TiO<sub>2</sub> (Figure S8), and IrO<sub>x</sub> (Figure 1f). By comparison, F-TiO2 can effectively disperse IrO<sub>x</sub> nanoparticles, while the dispersion of IrO<sub>x</sub> nanoparticles on TiO<sub>2</sub> is relatively nonuniform. The main reason of the favorable dispersion of IrO<sub>x</sub> nanoparticles on F-TiO<sub>2</sub> should be the formation of reduced Ti<sup>3+</sup> species due to the F-doping procedure. Ti3+ species with reductibility can effectively adsorb the IrCl<sub>6</sub><sup>2-</sup> precursor ion with high-valent Ir<sup>4+</sup> species during the synthesis process. Furthermore, unsupported IrO<sub>x</sub> catalyst displays more noticeable particles aggregation. The mean particle size and corresponding size distribution of IrO<sub>v</sub> nanoparticles were obtained by measuring 100 randomly selected particles. Overall, there exists no significant difference between IrO<sub>x</sub>/F-TiO<sub>2</sub> (2.14 nm, Inset in Figure 1d), IrO<sub>2</sub>/TiO<sub>2</sub> (2.15 nm, Figure S9a), and IrO<sub>2</sub> (2.18 nm, Figure S9b), although IrO<sub>x</sub>/F-TiO<sub>2</sub> possesses slightly smaller value. By comparison, IrO<sub>x</sub>/F-TiO<sub>2</sub> exhibits remarkably narrower size distribution, reflecting the well dispersion of IrOx nanoparticles on F-TiO<sub>2</sub>. High-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image of IrO<sub>x</sub>/ F-TiO<sub>2</sub> is shown in Figure 1e, the interplanar spacing is 0.224 nm for IrO<sub>v</sub>, slightly larger than the standard Ir (111) facet with 0.221 nm (JCPDS no. 06-0598), mainly due to the formation of surface oxidation state, which is similar to the enlarged

interplanar spacing of Ir (111) in IrW alloy reported by Luo et al.  $^{\scriptscriptstyle{[20]}}$  The interplanar spacing is 0.349 nm for F-TiO2, slightly smaller than the standard TiO2 (101) facet with 0.352 nm (JCPDS No. 21–1272), due to the partly substitution of O²- ion by F- ion with smaller radius. In addition, IrOx locates closely to F-TiO2, indicating that IrOx nanoparticles were successfully supported on F-TiO2. The elemental distribution within IrOx/F-TiO2 was investigated by the elemental mapping measurement, Ir, F, O and Ti elements uniformly distribute throughout the IrOx/F-TiO2 nanoparticles (Figure 1g). In addition, the atomic and weight contents of the elements acquired from the energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) agree well with the nominal elemental ratios (Figure 1i).

Outer charge ( $Q_{\rm outer}$ ) directly correlates with the OER activity due to the function of assessing the accessible active surface, which was obtained by integrating the cyclic voltammogram (CV) at a relatively higher scanning rate of 300 mV s<sup>-1[12,21]</sup> (Figure 2a). The  $Q_{\rm outer}$  value for IrO<sub>x</sub>/F-TiO<sub>2</sub> is 7.83 mC, about 2.96 times of IrO<sub>x</sub>/TiO<sub>2</sub> (2.64 mC) and 1.10 times of IrO<sub>x</sub> (7.10 mC), respectively, mainly resulted from the improved electrical conductivity and dispersing effect of F-TiO<sub>2</sub>. The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves show that IrO<sub>x</sub>/F-TiO<sub>2</sub> possesses enhanced catalytic activity (Figure 2b, *iR*-corrected). Specifically,

the overpotential of IrO<sub>x</sub>/F-TiO<sub>2</sub> to achieve current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> is only 272 mV, lower by 50, 12 and 38 mV than those of the IrO<sub>x</sub>/TiO<sub>2</sub>, IrO<sub>x</sub> and IrO<sub>2</sub>(CM) counterparts, respectively. Notably, IrO<sub>v</sub>/F-TiO<sub>2</sub> also shows prominent catalytic effect compared with those reported supported Ir-based catalysts (Table S2). Subsequently, the LSV currents normalized by  $Q_{outer}$ were added to investigate the intrinsic activity (Figure 2c). The intrinsic activities follow an order that IrO<sub>x</sub>/F-TiO<sub>2</sub> > IrO<sub>x</sub>/TiO<sub>2</sub> >  $IrO_x$ , specifically, the value of  $IrO_x/F$ - $TiO_2$  is 0.72 mA mC<sup>-1</sup>@1.6 V, apparently higher than those of IrO<sub>x</sub>/TiO<sub>2</sub> (0.61 mA mC<sup>-1</sup>@1.6 V) and IrO<sub>v</sub> (0.57 mA mC<sup>-1</sup>@1.6 V). This improvement mainly resulted from the prominent electronic interaction between F-TiO<sub>2</sub> and IrO<sub>x</sub>. The mass activities were managed and shown in Figure S10, IrO<sub>x</sub>/F-TiO<sub>2</sub> performs better 320.2 A  $g_{1r}^{-1}$  @1.55 V, about 3.96 and 3.64 times of IrO<sub>v</sub>/TiO<sub>2</sub> and IrO<sub>x</sub>, respectively. Excitingly, IrO<sub>x</sub>/F-TiO<sub>2</sub> also outperforms most of the reported supported Ir-based catalysts at different potentials (Table S3). Hence, F-TiO<sub>2</sub> support exhibits significant advantage of improving the catalyst utilization for OER.

Tafel slope and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were used to investigate the reaction kinetics.  $IrO_x/F-TiO_2$  displays the Tafel slope of only 53.1 mVdec<sup>-1</sup>, apparently smaller than other counterparts (Figure 2d), demonstrating the

most favorable OER kinetics. Nyquist plots are shown in Figure 2e, these plots are fitted by an equivalent circuit (EC), in which  $R_{\rm ct}$  is key component and refers to the charge transfer resistance. The radii of the low frequency semicircles (i.e., the  $R_{\rm ct}$ ) follow an order that  ${\rm IrO_x/F-TiO_2} < {\rm IrO_x} < {\rm IrO_x(CM)} < {\rm IrO_x/TiO_2}$ , exactly, the corresponding  $R_{\rm ct}$  values are 15.2, 20.1, 32.5 and 38.8  $\Omega$  (Table S4), respectively, demonstrating the fastest charge-transfer rate of  ${\rm IrO_x/F-TiO_2}$  during the reaction, which is in favor of enhancing the catalytic performance.

In order to investigate the reaction stability, potentiostatic and galvanostatic electrolysis tests were all applied, in which F-SnO $_2$  (FTO) conductive glass was used as the catalyst substrate. Prior to the tests, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) characterization was applied to investigate the morphology of IrO $_x$ /F-TiO $_2$  catalyst layer/FTO supporting layer (Figure S11a). The catalyst layer appears smooth and the mean thickness is 32.76  $\mu$ m by measuring three locations. Figure 2f shows the varying degrees of activity degradation during 10 h operation under the constant potential of 1.55 V, nevertheless, IrO $_x$ /F-TiO $_2$  still performs favorable reaction stability, demonstrating the superiority of the F-TiO $_2$  support. The remaining  $Q_{\text{outer}}$  for IrO $_x$ /F-TiO $_2$ , IrO $_x$ /TiO $_2$  and IrO $_x$  are 6.16, 1.58 and 2.73 mC (Figure S12),

respectively. Compared with those values before the potentiostatic tests, the fading rate of IrO<sub>x</sub>/F-TiO<sub>2</sub> (21.33%) is apparently smaller than IrO<sub>2</sub>/TiO<sub>2</sub> (40.15%) and IrO<sub>2</sub> (61.55%). Nyquist plots after the potentiostatic tests show that IrO<sub>x</sub>/F-TiO<sub>2</sub> still holds the most favorable OER kinetics (Figure S13), the R<sub>ct</sub> value of IrO<sub>x</sub>/F- $TiO_2$  (26.18  $\Omega$ ) is apparently smaller than those of  $IrO_x/TiO_2$ (42.32  $\Omega$ ) and IrO<sub>x</sub> (51.30  $\Omega$ ). Subsequently, XPS, XRD, inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES), EDX and SEM characterizations were applied to comprehensively investigate the oxidation state, composition, structure and morphology changes of the catalysts after the galvanostatic tests. The contents of Ir<sup>4+</sup> species fitted from the XPS spectra (Figures 2g and S14) increase to varying degrees (10.1% for IrO<sub>x</sub>/F-TiO<sub>2</sub>, 12.9% for IrO<sub>x</sub>/TiO<sub>2</sub>, 14.0% for IrO<sub>x</sub>). Apparently, F-TiO<sub>2</sub> can effectively suppress the further oxidation of Ir species. As shown in Figure 2h, diffraction peaks of Ir, TiO<sub>2</sub> and SnO<sub>2</sub> can be clearly distinguished. However, the diffraction peaks of formed IrO2 are illegible, there exists two main reasons: one is the overlapped effect from other intense diffraction peaks of Ir, TiO<sub>2</sub> and SnO<sub>2</sub>, another one is the low content of IrO<sub>2</sub> composition. ICP-OES was applied to investigate the oxidative dissolution of Ir species. Figure 2i shows that the Ir mass-loss

Chemistry Europe

ratio of IrO<sub>x</sub>/F-TiO<sub>2</sub> is only 16.83%, significantly lower than those of IrO<sub>x</sub>/TiO<sub>2</sub> (28.14%) and IrO<sub>x</sub> (35.26%), the main contribution should belong to the transferred electronegative electrons. Agreeing with the ICP-OES and XPS results, the loss of Ir element is apparent (38.14 to 33.28 wt%) judging from the EDX characterization (Figure S15). Furthermore, the content of O element increases from 24.21 to 28.53 wt%, mainly resulted from the oxidation of metallic Ir to Ir oxide. Excitingly, the content of F element almost unchanged (1.07 to 1.03 wt%), demonstrating the stable feature. Finally, SEM image shows a thinner thickness (29.66  $\mu$ m) of catalyst layer after the potentiostatic test (Figure S11b), the dissolution of Ir species should be the main factor. Furthermore, the dissolution action makes the catalyst layer become rougher. Even so, FTO substrate can still be covered and protected by the catalyst layer.

Similar to the potentiostatic tests, galvanostatic tests also reveal the enhanced reaction stability of  $IrO_x/F-TiO_2$  (Figure S16), the potential increased by only 21.6 mV after operating for 10 h under the constant current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. Subsequently, LSV tests were adopted again to research the reserved catalytic activity. Clearly,  $IrO_x/F-TiO_2$  still reserves relatively considerable activity (Figure S17a), in addition, the increased potentials of  $IrO_x/TiO_2$ ,  $IrO_x$  and  $IrO_2$ (CM) are all above 40 mV (Figure S17b–d), apparently inferior to  $IrO_x/F-TiO_2$  of only 17.7 mV. Hence, the robust stability advantage of F-TiO<sub>2</sub> support for acidic OER is again confirmed.

Next, overall water splitting operated in two-electrode cell was drived with  $IrO_x/F-TiO_2$ ,  $IrO_x$  or  $IrO_2(CM)$  as the anode catalyst, and Pt/C(CM) as the cathode catalyst. As expected, the cell employing  $IrO_x/F-TiO_2 \parallel Pt/C(CM)$  exhibits prominent catalytic activity, the voltages at 10 and 100 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> are only 1.535 and 1.787 V, respectively, lower by  $16 \mid 40$  mV and  $47 \mid 126$  mV than those of  $IrO_x \parallel Pt/C(CM)$  and  $IrO_2(CM) \parallel Pt/C(CM)$  (Figure 3a), respectively. Then, the galvanostatic tests for 20 h were implemented, by comparison,  $IrOx/F-TiO_2$  shows a more stable feature (Figure 3b). The well stability was confirmed through ICP-OES and TEM analysis. Figure 3c shows that the Ir mass-loss ratio of  $IrO_x/F-TiO_2$  is only 10.12%, significantly lower than that of  $IrO_x$  (25.56%). As shown in Figure 3d, although localized particles aggregation appears, well particles dispersion is still apparent on the whole.

In order to evaluate the application potential of IrO<sub>v</sub>/F-TiO<sub>2</sub>, SPEWE single cell was assembled by employing  $IrO_x/F-TiO_2$  and Pt/C(CM) as the anode and cathode catalysts, respectively, by contrast, the cell employing IrO<sub>2</sub>(CM) || Pt/C(CM) was also assembled. Obviously, IrO<sub>x</sub>/F-TiO<sub>2</sub>-based cell displays lower voltage compared with that of the IrO2(CM)-based cell, the voltages are only  $1.662 \, \text{V@1 A} \, \text{cm}^{-2}$  and  $1.749 \, \text{V@2 A} \, \text{cm}^{-2}$  for the former one, approximately lower by 44 49 mV than those of the latter one (Figure 4a). Subsequently, long-term stability tests of the IrO<sub>x</sub>/F-TiO<sub>2</sub>-based cell were implemented (Figure 4b), the voltage increased by only 17 mV after continuous operation up to 240 h at 0.5 A cm<sup>-2</sup>. The increased voltage reaches 31 mV when expanded to 1.0 A cm<sup>-2</sup> (Figure 4c), mainly resulted from the more seriously oxidative dissolution of Ir species at higher current density, even so, the stability is still satisfactory. In addition, EIS curves of the IrO<sub>x</sub>/F-TiO<sub>2</sub>-based cell

before and after the stability test were shown in Figure 4d.  $R_{\Omega}$  is the overall ohmic resistance of the cell, [24] the values before and after the stability test are 0.081 and 0.098  $\Omega$ , respectively. As a small fraction of overall components in the cell, the change of  $R_{\Omega}$  value for the F-TiO<sub>2</sub> support is bound to be much smaller than 17 m $\Omega$ , again indicating its stable feature. Meanwhile, the  $R_{\rm ct}$  value increased by only 33 m $\Omega$ , indicating the persistently favorable charge-transfer rate. Overall, the prominent catalytic

activity and stability of  $IrO_x/F-TiO_2$  are well present in the practical water electrolysis cell.

## Conclusion

In summary,  $IrO_x/F-TiO_2$  OER catalyst was successfully synthesized with F-TiO<sub>2</sub> as the effective support. F-TiO<sub>2</sub> of high electrical conductivity can modulate the electronic interaction, improve the dispersion, and restrict the aggregation of supported  $IrO_x$  nanoparticles. The electron-transfer procedure from F-TiO<sub>2</sub> to  $IrO_x$  can suppress the further oxidative dissolution of Ir species. Consequently,  $IrO_x/F-TiO_2$  exhibits low overpotential of only 272 mV, accompanied with prominent catalyst utilization, favorable reaction kinetics and stability. The superior catalytic performance is also present in the two-electrode overall water splitting and SPEWE single cell systems. Hence, F-TiO<sub>2</sub> support displays the practical potential for the future water electrolysis devices.

Then, the powder mixture was placed in a high-temperature tubular oven and reacted at 400 °C for 2 h under the N<sub>2</sub> atmosphere to obtain F-TiO<sub>2</sub>, the increasing rate of heating temperature was 5 °C min<sup>-1</sup> and the flow rate of N<sub>2</sub> is 80 cc min<sup>-1</sup>.

**Preparation of IrO**<sub>x</sub>/F-TiO<sub>2</sub>, **IrO**<sub>x</sub>/TiO<sub>2</sub> and **IrO**<sub>x</sub>. Ethylene glycol (EG) refluxing reduction method was adopted to synthesize these catalysts. For  $IrO_x/F$ - $TiO_2$  and  $IrO_x/TiO_2$ , 50 mg of F- $TiO_2$  or  $TiO_2$  was firstly added to 50 mL of EG, then, a certain amount of CTAB (nlr:nCTAB=1:3) was added, the mixture was ultrasonically dispersed for 1 h. Next, a certain amount of H<sub>2</sub>IrCl<sub>6</sub>×H<sub>2</sub>O (the weight loading of Ir on F- $TiO_2$  or  $TiO_2$  is 40 wt%) was added and stirred for 1 h. Subsequently, the suspension was refluxed at 160 °C for 3 h. Finally, the supported samples were obtained through centrifuged with deionized water and dried at 60 °C in the oven overnight. For unsupported  $IrO_x$ , the synthesis route was similar except for the addition of support.

SPEWE single cell test. The active area of the single cell was 12.5 cm², Nafion® 115 membrane was selected as the solid polymer electrolyte. The catalyst coated membrane (CCM) electrode was prepared as follows: catalyst inks were firstly obtained through dispersing the catalyst powder with deionized water, Nafion® solution and isopropyl alcohol. Then, the catalyst ink was sprayed onto each side of membrane. The anode (IrO<sub>x</sub>/F-TiO<sub>2</sub> or IrO<sub>2</sub>(CM)) and cathode (Pt/C(CM)) catalyst loadings were 2.0 and 1.0 mg cm², respectively. Ti mess (4 cm diameter) and carbon paper were used as the anode and cathode diffusion layers, respectively. The membrane electrode assembly (MEA) was fabricated by hot pressing the prepared CCM and anode-cathode diffusion layers at 120°C and 2 MPa for 1 min. SPEWE single cell was assembled with the prepared MEA and other components such as bipolar plate, end plate, seal framework, etc.

Steady-state polarization tests were performed at  $80\,^{\circ}\text{C}$  and atmospheric pressure, with the increasing current density from 0.03 to  $2\,\text{A\,cm}^{-2}$ . The stability test was performed in galvanostatic mode under the constant current density of 0.5 and 1.0  $\text{A\,cm}^{-2}$  for 240 h,

respectively. Deionized water as the reactant was pumped into the anode side from the water reservoir with the flow rate of  $50 \text{ cc}\,\text{min}^{-1}$ .

The EIS measurements of the single cell were performed in the frequency range of 0.1 Hz to 10 kHz at the current density of 0.1 A cm<sup>-2</sup>, 10 mV amplitude of sinusoidal potential perturbation was employed in the measurements.

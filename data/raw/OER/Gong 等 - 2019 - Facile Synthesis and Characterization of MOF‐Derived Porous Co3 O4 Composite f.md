Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) has gained wide attentions due to its important role in hydrogen production. Being one of the half reactions, the water oxidation was proved to be the key step to restrain the overall of water splitting. Herein, Co3O4 composites were successfully obtained by directly annealing a MOF-derived Co complex under air condition. The Co3O4 complex with a surface area of 34.7 m2 /g and wider pore size distribution obtained at 350°C was found to be the most active OER catalyst in 1 M KOH, an overpotential of 420 mV@10 mA/ cm<sup>2</sup> with a Tafel slope of 55 mV/dec was detected. This simple and inexpensive approach makes it become a new candidate for OER.

#### **Introduction**

Nowadays, more and more attentions have been paid to energy consumption and environmental problems in global.[1–6] The involved oxygen evolution reaction (OER) plays an important role in fuel cells, metal-air batteries and water splitting devices.[7–11] And the multiple proton-couple electron transfer process causes it sluggish kinetics of the OER.[12–14] Thus, the synthesis of catalyst with high catalytic efficiency and excellent stability becomes the critical step. Ruthenium (Ru)/ iridium (Ir) oxides have been regarded as the best OER catalyst, due to its low overpotential, large current density and efficient work ability at all pH values.[15–16] And among them the RuO2 in alkaline condition with overpotential of 140 mV is considered to be the best metal oxides catalyst. However, the high cost, poor stability and scarcity limit their applications. To conquer this, a large number of inexpensive OER catalysts involve firstrow transition metal oxides have been exploited to catalyze the water oxidation. Up to now, the non-noble-metal oxides and hydroxides of Co,[17] Ni,[18] Mn,[19] Fe,[20] Mo[21] and W[22] have been reported for OER catalysts, among these catalysts candidates, the CoO and Co3O4 have been widely used in OER due to their low cost, high catalytic activity and stability.[23–26]

Metal-organic framework (MOFs) or coordination polymers (PCPs) have attracted more and more attentions in recent years owing to its unique topology, large specific surface area and porous structure.[27–29] Due to the original structure and properties, MOFs have a wide applications in gas storage,[30] sensor,[31–32] heterogeneous catalysis,[33–34] separation,[35–36] drug delivery,[37] light,[38] electricity,[39] magnetism[40] and so on. MOFs also can be applied as self-sacrificial templates or precursors to construct novel nanostructure with various morphologies. Since the MOF-5 was employed as the self-sacrificial template to synthesis porous carbon, exhibits a high specific surface area and important hydrogen uptake as well as excellent electrochemical double-layered capacitor,[41] several other kinds of MOFs have been used to prepare porous carbon materials, metal oxides and metal oxide/carbon materials.[42–45]

In this work, we developed a facile strategy for the fabrication of self-assembled Co3O4 composites using [Co(oda) (bipy)(H2O)]⋅2H2O as self-sacrificing template and precursor. Co3O4 composite constructed with precursor at 350°C show the largest surface area and abundant active sites. Also application of Co3O4 composites on OER for water splitting in alkaline solutions with high catalytic activity was studied.

#### **Results and Discussion**

The crystallographic structure and phase purity of the assynthesized precursor were examined by X-ray power diffraction (XRD). Figure 1a shows the XRD pattern of the assynthesized precursor. All the diffraction peaks can be readily indexed as a pure phase, no other impurities are observed and the results match the previous report well. And the as-obtained Co–MOF with a low crystallinty compared with the simulated Co–MOF. Figure 1c presents thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) curves of the [Co(oda)(bipy)(H2O)]⋅2H2O precursor. It is found that the precursor went through two section sharp weight loss, the first weight loss of 14% (calculated 54/403.21=13.4%) from 40–155 °Ccorresponds to the loss of three water molecules. A second weight loss of 64% at about 335 °C is due to the complete combustion of the oxydiacetic acid and 2, 2' bipyridine to form Co3O4, which was confirmed by the X-ray powder diffraction pattern. Based on the results of the TGA to ensure the calcination temperature, we chose the calcination temperature at 300°C, 350°C and 400°C as experimental decompose temperature of the Co–MOF precursor to Co3O4.

expected, the precursor of Co–MOF was thoroughly transformed into Co3O4 composites after annealing at various temperature in air at a heating rate of 10°C/min. Figure 1b shows a XRD pattern of the Co3O4 and the diffraction perks appearing at 2θ=31.38 °, 36.97 °, 38.68 °, 44.93 °, 55.86 °, 59.58 °, 65.48 ° and 68.89 ° are respectively correspond to the same crystalline planes with standard pattern of Co3O4 (JCPDS no.65- 3103). No peak from the other impure phased was observed, indicating high purity of as-obtained sample. As can be seen from Figure 1b, increasing of height of the peak with the increasing of temperature showed that the crystallinity increased. Simultaneously, with the increased of the calcination temperature, the width of peak decreased, which indicated the reunite of Co3O4.

Size and morphology of Co–MOF precursors and Co3O4 composites were further characterized by SEM. As we can observe from Figure 2a-f, all of the sample showed sphere-like nanoparticles and some particles were further assembled with each other to form irregular structure. There, the size of nanoparticle is about 20–50 nm and such small nanoparticles would exhibit higher activity for OER. Moreover, along with rising of temperatures, aggregation of nanoparticles become more outstanding, which would further decrease the BET of materials. In addition, the SEM images of the Co–MOF with different magnifications in support information (Figure S4) and it shows similar morphology with Co3O4, which indicate the morphology of Co–MOF is maintained during calcination.The atomic ratio of the Co3O4 was determined to be 43.07/56.93= 0.76 according to the quantitative analysis of EDS (Figure 2g.), which is consistent with the atomic ratio Co:O=3/4 of the Co3O4.

The surface composition and bonding configureuration of Co3O4 composites were characterized by XPS. As depicted in Figure 3a, the XPS spectrum showed the presence of the Co 2p3/2 peak at 778.45 eV and the Co 2p1/2 peak at 796.7 eV with spin-oribit splitting of 18.2 eV, which indicated the formation of the Co3O4 phase. The Co 2p deconvolution led to two spinoribit doublets with Co<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> (796 and 780.8 eV) and Co3<sup>+</sup> (778.74 and 780.81 eV). The presence of a satellite peak in the spectra at 789.0 eV further indicated the existence of the Co3O4 phase.[47] The O 1s peak showed in Figure 3b corresponds to mental-oxygen bonds. The bingding energy of 528.9 eV, 529.3 eV and 530.4 eV being attributed to the lattice oxygen (OL), oxygen vacancy (OV) and chemisorbed oxygen (OC), respectively.[48]

The specific surface area and the porosity of the asobtained were characterized by the nitrogen sorption isotherms (Figure 3c). The specific surfaced areas of Co3O4-300°C, Co3O4-350 °C and Co3O4-400°C are calculated by the BET method to be 67.72, 34.75 and 30.55 m2 /g, respectively. Distinct hysteresis loop of typical type IV shape of the isotherm indicated the existence of porous structure,[49] which formed with the large amounts of H2O, CO2 and NOx released in the decomposing process of the Co–MOF precursors. The pore size distribution of all samples exhibit a pore size centering at 3.06 nm, which suggest that the pores of all samples become wider in distribution. The porous structure possibly supported more active sites in the Co3O4 composite, which could be accessible channels for electrolyte infiltration and facilitate to the sufficient contact between catalyst and electrolyte.

To further characterize the microstructure of Co3O4-350°C, extensive transmission electron microscopy (TEM) investigations were carried out. The irregular nanoparticles can be observed in catalyst of Co3O4-350°C. The high-resolution TEM image and the corresponding selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (Figure 4c and d) obviously indicate the high crystallinity of the Co3O4-350°C. In addition, the HRTEM image of Co3O4-350°C nanoparticle (Figure 4c) gives a lattice spacing of 0.248 nm, corresponding to the (311) interplanar spacings of Co3O4 (JCPDS no.65-3103). The analysis result of HTEM is consistent with our XRD analysis

The synthesized samples were deposited on a glass carbon electrode to investigate the OER electrocatalytic activity in alkaline solution. The catalytic activities of the Co3O4 composites electrode have been assessed for the OER in 1.0 M KOH by liner sweep voltammetry at a scan rate of 5 mV/s. Figure 5a. shows the typical LSV of the different catalysts with iRcompensation. It can be seen that Co3O4-350°C exhibits good OER activity, with a low overpotential of 447 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> and earliest onset potential (about 1.56 V). The GC substrate was not electrochemical active and showed a very low OER current. It is obvious that the

overpotential and the onset potential of Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-350°C was much low than as-obtained catalyst Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-300°C, Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-400°C, which demonstrates that compared with the other two catalyst Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-300°C, Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-400°C, the catalyst Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-350°C has a good electrocatalytic water oxidation activity. In order to further study the effect of catalyst dosage on the catalytic properties, five different loading amount of Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-350°C on glassy carbon electrode was investigated. As we can seen in Figure 5c, the 1.340 mg/cm<sup>2</sup> of catalyst loading amount achieved a current density of 10 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> with a low overpotential of 420 mV, exhibited good OER activity compared the 5.306 mg/cm<sup>2</sup>, 2.608 mg/cm<sup>2</sup>, 0.893 mg/cm<sup>2</sup>, 0.536 mg/cm<sup>2</sup>. This indicated that higher or lower catalyst loading would reduce the catalyst activity. As expected, the lowset OER overpotential of 162 mV@10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> for IrO<sub>2</sub> in 1.0 M KOH observed.(Figure S6)

As shown in Figure 6a We also exploited the Tafel slope to evaluate the OER kinetics. The Tafel slope of the  $Co_3O_4$ -350°C is 55 mV/dec, which is smaller than that of  $Co_3O_4$ -300°C (58 mV/

dec),  ${\rm Co_3O_4\text{-}}400^{\circ}{\rm C}$  (66 mV/dec). The lower Tafel slope of the  ${\rm Co_3O_4\text{-}}350^{\circ}{\rm C}$  composite indicates its more excellent kinetics of OER. The fact shows that increasing of the overpotentials result in the enhancement of the current densities. The obtained catalysts show similar Tafel slopes for OER, illustrating similar reaction pathways and rate determining step for prepared catalysts.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements of as-obtained catalyst were performed at 0.65 V from 100 KHz to 0.1 Hz in 1 M KOH solution to further clarify the relationship between the structure and function of the electrocatalysts. As shown in Figure 6b, the semicircles in the Nyquist plot are due to the charge-transfer resistance (R<sub>CT</sub>), a lower value corresponds to faster charge-transfer. Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-350°C catalyst exhibited a smaller Rct (~76  $\Omega$ ), and slight lager than Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-300 °C(~71  $\Omega$ ). The possible reason was generation of oxygen bubbles and the bubbles hindered the contaction between the electrolyte and the catalytic. The smaller charge resistant causes more bubble to emerge. And compared with

the  $Co_3O_4$ -400°C (~155  $\Omega$ ), the  $Co_3O_4$ -350°C (~76  $\Omega$ ) much smaller, and the Rct of the  $Co_3O_4$ -400°C (~155  $\Omega$ ) is probably

two times as large as  $\text{Co}_3\text{O}_4\text{-350}^\circ\text{C}$  (~76  $\Omega$ ). The fact further demonstrated the Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-350°C have a much faster electron transfer process and higher activity. The electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) of the Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> catalysts were estimated in 1 M KOH electrolyte by the electrical double-layer capacitance (C<sub>dl</sub>). The C<sub>dl</sub> derived from the cyclic voltammogram (CVs) measurement at different scan rates. The high C<sub>dl</sub> of the Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>- $350^{\circ}$ C (0.93 mF cm<sup>-1</sup>) compared with the  $Co_3O_4$ -300°C  $(0.85 \text{ mF cm}^{-1})$  and  $Co_3O_4$ -400°C $(0.37 \text{ mF cm}^{-1})$  indicated  $Co_3O_4$ -350°C has a large reaction specific surface area in the electrochemical reaction system. Abundant active sites of the Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-350°C enhanced electrocatalytic activity of the OER. EIS and ECSA analysis showed that the Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-350°C have the smallest Rct of  $\sim 76 \Omega$  and largest ECSA of 0.93 mF cm<sup>-1</sup>. The fact demonstrated the Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-350°C with a faster charge transfer between electrolyte and catalyzer.

Long term durability of  $Co_3O_4$ -350°C was performed using chronoamperometric measurements as shown in Figure 7. The constant voltage of 460 mV drove a current density of about 3 mV cm<sup>-2</sup> for 20000 s. Rapid loss in OER activity of  $Co_3O_4$ -350°C material shows in OER activity at the beginning of polarization mainly caused by oxidation of the catalysts at high anodic potential and the same phenomenon occurs in precious mental oxides,  $IrO_2$  and  $RuO_2$ .

We listed the Table 1 to further compare the as-obtained  $Co_3O_4$ -350°C with the relevant catalytic materials. The over-

potential of the  $Co_3O_4$ -350°C (447 mV@10 mA/cm²) is lower than bulk  $Co_3O_4^{50}$  (711 mV@10 mA/cm²),  $Co_3O_4^{[50]}$  (~

496 mV@10 mA/cm²),  $Co_3O_4$ / SWNTs<sup>[51]</sup> (580 mV@10 mA/cm²) and Fe-Co $_3O_4$ <sup>[52]</sup> (32/1) (~486 mV@10 mA/cm²).

Lower overpotential of as-obtained Co3O4-350°C indicates higher catalytic activity. The reason may be contributed to small and approximate globular shape nanoparticles with lots of active sites. Especially, the small particles in the catalyst play an important role in the electrochemical reaction system. However, the Co3O4 /rm-GO[53] (310 mV@10 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> ) and Co3O4 /N-doped[53] (310 mV@10 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> ) with a very lower overpotential indicate employing reduced graphene oxide as the template with the high conductivity and N-doped can effectively improve the OER active in alkaline solution.

As noted above, we also demonstrated the possible electrocatalytic mechanism of the obtained Co3O4-350°C catalyst.

$$A^* + OH^- \rightarrow A^* - OH + e^-$$

$$A^* - OH + OH^- \rightarrow A^* - O + H_2O + e^-$$

$$A^* - O + OH^- \rightarrow A^* - OOH + e^-$$

$$A^* - OOH + OH^- \rightarrow A^* - O_2 + e^-$$

$$A^* - O_2 \rightarrow A^* + O_2$$

As showed above, A\* represent the active sites on the Co3O4 catalyst in basic mediate, the main OER process of the as-obtained Co3O4 catalysts are as follows[54] : (1) OH adsorbed on the surface of the Co3O4 to produce adsorbed OH species (A\*-OH); (2) A\*-OH would react with another OH to generate H2O and atomic O (A\*-O), with a free electron produced. (3) A\*- O would further reacted with OH to form adsorbed OOH species (A\*-OOH). (4) A\*-OOH continued to react with OH in the basic solution to cause the formation of adsorbed O2. (5) finally, the formed A\*-O2 causing the release of O2. The process of (1)-(4) are accompanied with the release of electrons.

Using MOF as precursors has been regarded as an effective route to fabricate high-quality anisotropic materials. In addition, the infinite complexes supply abundant precursors to synthesize materials with different structure.[55] There, Co–MOF was constructed through 2,2'-bipyridine and oxydiacetic acid, and extensive inter molecular hydrogen bonding and π - π interactions results in a 3D supramolecular architecture. We fabricated Co3O4 composites through a facile thermal decomposition of the Co–MOF as a precursor. The as-obtained Co3O4- 350°Cwas found to be the most active OER catalyst. In brief, the reason that Co3O4-350°C exhibits an enhanced electrocatalytic water oxidation activity can be ascribed to several factors. First, abundant active sites and faster electron transfer rate can efficiently improve the OER performance in the electrochemical reaction system. Second, small nanoparticles and the high crystallinity of Co3O4-350°C became the key factors to improve the OER activity. Third, porous structure favors accessible channels for electrolyte infiltration and faster diffusion and reaction at the interface of the electrolyte and catalyst.

## **Conclusions**

In conclusion, Co3O4 composites were fabricated through a facile thermal decomposition of the Co–MOF as a precursor. Co3O4-350°C composite has been demonstrated as a high efficiency OER electrocatalyst in 1 M KOH, showing a lower overpotential 447 mV@10 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> and a Tafel slope of 55 mV/ dec. Large surface,area, porous structure, more active sites and faster charge transfer make as-obtained Co3O4-350°C composite as an efficient OER catalyst in the electrochemical reaction system.

Despite the high theoretical energy density of lithium-oxygen (Li-O<sub>2</sub>) batteries, the charge/discharge efficiency is unsatisfactory. To overcome this critical problem, we synthesized heme-graphene composites (HEME-GO) as catalysts for Li-O<sub>2</sub> batteries. The introduction of graphene produced  $\pi$ - $\pi$  interactions with the heme matrix, resulting in a composite with enhanced ORR/OER catalytic activity. The free energy diagram of the redox reaction was calculated using density functional theory (DFT) for HEME-GO based on the four-electron reaction pathway, and it was demonstrated that HEME-GO has the lowest ORR overpotential (0.67 V) and OER overpotential (0.53 V). The catalytic mechanism of HEME-GO was also quantitatively described by calculating the adsorption energy of intermediates in the rate determining step (RDS). In addition, the Li-O<sub>2</sub> batteries with the composite catalyst exhibited better cycling performance, discharge capacity (7770 mAh g<sup>-1</sup>), and lower overpotential due to the ability of heme to scavenge superoxide radicals and thus protect the electrode. The results in this paper contribute to the understanding of the redox process of Li-O<sub>2</sub> batteries for organic systems and suggest innovative ideas for the design of environmentally friendly batteries

In recent years, lithium-ion batteries have been playing an important role in portable electronic devices and electric vehicles with their superior energy density. So far, however, lithium batteries have not been able to meet the energy density required for electric vehicles. Li-O2 batteries have attracted much attention because of their energy density comparable to fossil fuels. Among them, nonaqueous lithium-oxygen batteries<sup>2,3</sup> have been actively developed and researched worldwide due to their demonstrated potential in terms of low cost and environmental friendliness. However, the development of non-aqueous lithium-oxygen batteries is still in its infancy, and there are still many serious problems to be solved, such as large reaction overpotential and low cycle life, or because the superoxide radicals generated by the reaction lead to some byproducts that cannot be easily decomposed to block the cathode so that the discharge capacity is limited, etc. Most of these problems are related to the slow kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen precipitation reaction (OER). In most cases, electrocatalysts are essential to facilitate the oxygen reduction and oxygen precipitation reactions during battery discharge and charging.<sup>4,5</sup> Commonly used electrocatalysts are mainly based on noble metals and their alloys or oxides, 6-9 but resource and environmental constraints have prevented their widespread use. Therefore, developing cost-effective and environmentally friendly catalysts with better catalytic activity is important.

Porphyrins are tetrapyrrole macrocycles involved in many chemical processes in biological systems, such as O<sub>2</sub> transport, activation, oxygen reduction reactions (ORR), and photosynthesis. Porphyrin is considered to be a promising molecular catalyst for many biological and chemical oxidation reactions, inspiring researchers to explore the application of porphyrin materials in the field of catalysis: Jasinski Raymond's group was the first to introduce metallo-porphyrin-like macrocyclic compounds as catalysts for biological enzymes into the field of ORR research in 1964, <sup>10</sup> it was found that porphyrins facilitate the 4e-reduction reaction of oxygen and largely improve the stability and efficiency of the catalyst. <sup>11,12</sup> However, the catalytic activity of porphyrins is still unsatisfactory due to the instability and high binding energy of porphyrin catalyst materials. To improve its catalytic activity, researchers have invested a lot of research work. <sup>13</sup>

On the other hand, porphyrin also has good performance in maintaining battery stability. Superoxide radicals are inevitably generated during the discharge of Li-O2 batteries, and most ether electrolytes are attacked by superoxide radicals and decomposed to form Li<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, HCO<sub>2</sub>Li, CH<sub>3</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>Li, and polyether. Also, these superoxide radicals attack air electrodes indiscriminately and produce irreversible by-products <sup>15</sup>(Li<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> is generated when attacking the carbon electrode). Therefore, the scavenging of excessive superoxide radicals is important to protect the air electrode and ensure the long-term stable cycling of the battery. For scavenging superoxide radicals, researchers have gained much inspiration from natural biological materials 16 such as melanin and tea polyphenols 17 to protect Li-O<sub>2</sub> batteries from the attack of superoxide radicals during charging and discharging, thus enabling the batteries to obtain excellent cycling performance. Researchers have also discovered the application potential of porphyrin in scavenging superoxide radicals in Li-O<sub>2</sub> batteries through experimental studies: Ryu et al. added 18 heme to the electrolyte and demonstrated through experimental characterization that heme was involved in the release of superoxide intermediates and promoted the generation of products, and Jerng's team<sup>19</sup> used pure heme as well as ligand-modified heme as Li-O2 battery catalysts, also confirmed the excellent performance of heme in superoxide radical scavenging.

The active catalytic activity towards oxygen and the scavenging effect on superoxide radicals make the application of heme in nonaqueous lithium-oxygen batteries possible. However, it was found in the experiments that heme is easily shed during the electrocatalytic reaction, so it is difficult to apply it directly to redox catalysis. Modification<sup>20,21</sup> and structural support<sup>22,23</sup> of porphyrin materials can solve this problem. Carbon-based materials are typical materials with high specific surface area, and at the same time, they are widely used in batteries due to their high electrical conductivity and low cost.<sup>24</sup> The exploration of cathode materials that can successfully host heme catalysts is a must. Graphene, as a Sp2 carbon material, can provide a large specific surface area for the reaction on the one hand, <sup>25</sup> and on the other hand possesses a large number of free-flowing  $\pi$ electrons, which makes them potential catalysts for electron-demand reactions. However, these  $\pi$ -electrons are too inert to be used directly in ORR.<sup>26</sup> The introduction of porphyrin materials not only weakens the  $\pi$ - $\pi$  interactions within the carbon material but also imparts excellent properties to the composites through the synergistic effect between the two materials. <sup>27-29</sup> The introduction of porphyrin

materials is a key factor in the development of composites. The composite of porphyrin molecules with graphene using  $\pi$ - $\pi$  interaction can achieve effective electron transfer between the two materials and improve the catalytic performance of the composite. On the other hand, porphyrin molecules are adsorbed on graphene mainly through van der Waals interactions, so the molecular properties of the adsorbent, such as its reactivity and active sites, can be preserved. In recent years, researchers have obtained satisfactory results using graphene for the structural support of porphyrin materials,  $^{30,31}_{30,31}$  also the application of this composite structure in the field of catalysis  $^{32-35}_{32}$  has been studied and explored. The excellent performance of the composite of heme and graphene in electrochemical catalysis inspired us to apply it in the direction of catalysts for non-aqueous Li-O<sub>2</sub> batteries.

In this paper, to improve the catalytic activity and stability of heme, we prepared HEME-GO by hydrothermal method<sup>36</sup> and characterized the composites by transmission electron microscopy and UV-vis spectroscopy analysis to demonstrate that heme and graphene formed cross-linked complexes. We evaluated the effect of the composites on the electrochemical performance of non-aqueous lithium-oxygen batteries by charge-discharge tests, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and voltammetric characterization. SEM and XPS were used to characterize the cathodes at different cycling stages to demonstrate the contribution of the composites to the reduction of battery side reactions, and we illustrated the reduction of side reaction generation by the composites through the scavenging of superoxide radicals by NBT reduction assay. To investigate the catalytic performance of the composites and their effects on the redox reactions in non-aqueous lithium-oxygen batteries, we investigated the ORR/OER mechanism of pure graphene (GO), heme (HEME), and HEME-GO in non-aqueous lithium-oxygen batteries using first-principles calculations. Our experimental and computational results promote the understanding of the ORR/OER process in non-aqueous Li-O2 batteries and also provide ideas for the design of novel ORR/OER catalysts by introducing eco-friendly biomolecules into the catalysts.

#### Experimental

HEME-GO composite material preparation.—The heme-graphene oxide composites were synthesized by a one-step

hydrothermal methodas: <sup>36,37</sup> 0.1 g of heme and 0.1 g of graphene were accurately measured on an electronic balance, respectively, and the weighed samples were put into a polytetrafluoroethylene liner, and then 4.0 ml of freshly prepared 0.1 M NaOH solution and 30.0 ml of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and stir well. The Teflon liner was sonicated for one hour and then loaded into a hydrothermal reactor in a constant temperature blast oven for hydrothermal heating, and the reaction was carried out at 115 °C for 24 h. The reacted black suspension solution was cooled to room temperature and centrifuged in a centrifuge, then washed with ethanol and deionized water repeatedly several times, and finally dried using a vacuum drying oven at 60 °C for 12 h. The pure heme-graphene oxide composite was obtained and stored in a refrigerator at 4 °C.

Li-O<sub>2</sub> battery electrochemical tests.—The assembled lithiumoxygen batteries were subjected to constant current charge/discharge cycle tests on the Land CT2001A test system (Wuhan, China) at room temperature. All of the electrochemical tests were performed under 1 atm pure oxygen (99.999%) atmosphere. The constant current charge/discharge tests were performed with a limiting capacity of 500 mAh g<sup>-1</sup>, a protection voltage of 2-5 V, and a current density of 100 mA g<sup>-1</sup>. The voltage range for the deep charge/discharge was 2  $\sim$  4.5 V. Cyclic voltammetric (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) tests were performed on an AMETEK PARSTAT 4000+ electrochemical workstation (America). The cyclic voltammetry test was performed in the voltage range of 2.0 ~ 4.5 V vs Li/Li+ with a scan rate of  $5~\text{mV}\cdot\text{s}^{-1}$ . The frequency range of the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy test was  $10^5\sim10^{-2}~\text{Hz}$  with an AC potential wave amplitude of  $5 \text{ mV} \cdot \text{s}^{-1}$ . The resistance and conductivity of the coated and dried positive electrode sheet were tested using an RTS-8 four-probe tester.

**Calculation method.**—The simulations performed in this paper are based on the first-principles Dmol<sup>3</sup> procedure of Density Function Theory (DFT). The Perdew—Burke—Ernzerhof (PBE) generalized<sup>38</sup> function under the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) is used as the inter-electron exchange relevance function. The atomic orbital basis group is specified as a double numerical orbital basis group + p-orbital polarization function (DNP), and the

total orbital cutoff is chosen to be 5.1 Å. All Electron Relativistic is used to treat the relativistic effects of the metal atoms. A vacuum space of 20 Å along the perpendicular direction is applied to avoid the interaction between the adjacent structures. In all calculations, Van der Waals interactions are described by empirical corrections in the Grimme scheme, i.e., DFT-D. Special K-point methods in the form of Monkhorst-Pack are used for all Brillouin zone integrals, and  $3 \times 3 \times 1$  K-points are used for structural relaxations of the original structure. The energy convergence criterion in the atomic structure optimization is  $1.0e^{-6}$ Ha, and the Hellmann-Feynman atomic force convergence criterion is no more than 0.002 Ha Å per atom with a maximum displacement of 0.005 Å.

#### Results

Characterization of material composites.—Firstly, HEME-GO was prepared by one-step hydrothermal method (shown in Fig. 1), and then the prepared composites were characterized and analyzed by superoxide radical scavenging experiments. The successful compounding of the two materials was determined by TEM testing and UV-vis testing, and the NBT tests demonstrated the ability of the composite to scavenge ROS. The HEME-GO was applied as cathode catalysts in non-aqueous lithium-air batteries, and the catalytic performance and electrocatalysis of the materials were investigated utilizing electrochemical tests. Based on this, the cathode after cycling was characterized and tested by SEM and XPS methods to demonstrate the contribution of the composite material to the long-cycle stability of lithium-oxygen batteries. To investigate in depth the material catalytic mechanism of HEME-GO and the specific four-electron reaction path of HEME-GO when used as a catalyst for lithium-air batteries, we simulated the electronic properties, four-electron reaction path and thermodynamic free energy of the composites by first-principles calculations. In addition, the intrinsic catalytic factors of the material were explored based on the relationship between the adsorption energy and the overpotential of the reaction intermediates.

Characterization of the material using transmission electron microscopy provides a more visual representation of the compounding success of the material. As shown in Figs. 2a and 2c are transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of graphene, respectively, from which it can be found that graphene shows a lamellar fold structure, which can provide a good substrate for the attachment of heme. Figures 2b and 2d are transmission electron microscopy images of HEME-GO, from which it can be seen that graphene retains the original lamellar fold structure, based on which heme is successfully compounded into the graphene structure, forming a cross-linked complex, which indicates that the heme-graphene material has been successfully compounded together. The chemical formula of the porphyrin iron molecule is C<sub>34</sub>H<sub>32</sub>FeN<sub>4</sub>O<sub>4</sub>Cl, while graphene does not contain N and Fe elements, i.e., only the porphyrin iron molecule contains N and Fe elements in the whole composite, so the distribution of C, N, and Fe elements by EDS scan can qualitatively illustrate the composite effect of porphyrin iron molecule and graphene. The EDS layered images of the HEME-GO are shown in Fig. 2. From Figs. 2e-2g, it can be seen that a large number of C and N carbon elements and Fe elements are successfully detected. Among them, the C elements reflect the inherent elemental components of graphene, and the uniform distribution of N and Fe elements confirms that the iron porphyrin molecules and graphene are successfully compounded together.

Superoxide radical scavenging test.—To investigate the compounding of heme and graphene materials more deeply, we characterized the materials by UV–vis spectroscopy, are shown in Fig. 3b. (a). Graphene has a characteristic absorption peak at 232 nm, which is formed due to the  $\pi$ - $\pi$  leap of atoms in the C–C bond on the aromatic ring in the graphene structure. Heme has a characteristic Soret absorption band at 378 nm. In the figure, the absorption peaks at 279 nm and 407 nm correspond to the

characteristic peaks of GO and HEME in the composite, respectively. These two absorption peaks are red-shifted, indicating  $\pi$ - $\pi$  interactions between GO and HEME, which suggests that the deposition of HEME in graphene sheets through  $\pi$ - $\pi$  interactions has been successfully achieved. This indicates that a one-step hydrothermal method can be achieved for material compounding between HEME and GO.

During the discharge of the Li-O<sub>2</sub> battery, O<sub>2</sub> is reversibly reduced to the long-standing superoxide  $O_2^{-39}$  (Eq. 1), of which a portion of  $O_2^-$  will react with  $Li^+$  to form  $LiO_2$ , which further reacts to form Li<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> Eq. 2). But there still exists most of the O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> will attack the electrolyte and air electrode in the three-phase interface, leading to their decomposition. With the addition of heme-based materials, Fe<sup>3+</sup> in the active center of heme during discharge can react with  $O_2^-$  to form the HEME(Fe<sup>2+</sup>)- $O_2$  complex (Eq. 3). During the charging process, the HEME(Fe<sup>2+</sup>)-O<sub>2</sub> complex decomposes, releasing O<sub>2</sub> and transferring electrons to the electrode, thus returning to the Fe<sup>3+</sup> state (Eq. 4). During the charging and discharging cycle of the battery, the Fe active center of the hemebased material continuously plays the role of scavenging superoxide radicals in the three-phase interface, promoting the conversion of superoxide (O2-) into oxygen, reducing the attack on the electrode and electrolyte, and inhibiting the occurrence of side reactions, thus maintaining a long-life and stable cycle of the battery.

To further verify the scavenging effect of heme-based composites on superoxide radicals, the free radical scavenging ability of HEME-GO and heme was examined by the NBT reduction method by reacting KO2 with crown ether to generate superoxide radicals and adding them to the electrolyte (LiTFSI -TEGDME) using nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT), which is commonly used to detect free radicals. 40 Due to the reduction of free radicals, the color of NBT changes from yellow to blue. We added heme and HEME-GO as free radical scavengers to the electrolyte solution and observed the changes in the UV-vis spectra of the NBT solution, and both materials exhibited free radical scavenging ability, as shown in Fig. 3b, indicating that the ability of heme to scavenge superoxide radicals was still retained after material compounding, but it can be seen in the UV spectra that the free radical scavenging ability of heme The free radical scavenging ability of heme was somewhat affected after the compounding with graphene.

Electrochemical tests.—In order to test the electrochemical performance of HEME-GO materials, we first conducted deep charge/discharge tests on Li-air batteries with composite materials as cathodes. Figure 4a shows the first deep discharge curves of lithium-air batteries assembled with HEME-GO catalysts at a current density of 100 mA g<sup>-1</sup> (compared to lithium-air batteries assembled in the presence of heme and bare electrocatalyst CNT). The specific capacity of HEME-GO is 7770 mAh g<sup>-1</sup> (loaded carbon nanotubes), while the specific capacity of the pure heme battery is 2612 mAh g (loaded carbon nanotubes), which is lower than the capacity of the batteries assembled without the catalyst (about 3090 mAh g<sup>-1</sup>, pure carbon nanotubes). The discharge plateaus of composite and pure heme catalysts are similar (about 2.7 V) and both are higher than that of pure CNT (about 2.5 V), but the discharge capacity of pure heme is poorer compared to that of pure CNT, and the discharge is terminated early because the heme catalyst is shed and deposited during the electrochemical reaction and cannot continue to play a catalytic role also blocking the battery cathode. After the material compounding with graphene, the discharge capacity is greatly improved, and we speculate that the reason is that the addition of graphene structure facilitates the formation and maintenance of the three-phase interface, thus accommodating more discharge products. 41 In addition, the composite of heme and graphene activates the inert carbon  $\pi$ - $\pi$  interaction, which significantly improves the electrochemical reaction efficiency and preserves the ability of heme, a natural macromolecule, to scavenge superoxide radicals, thus enabling the battery to exhibit stable and excellent discharge capacity.

In terms of cycle stability, we remove the number of cycles in the early unstable charging and discharging state, and compare the first and 20th cycles of charging and discharging to a stable charging and discharging platform. We can see in Fig. [4b](#page-5-0) of the first lap charge/ discharge curve that HEME-GO has the highest discharge platform, but the charging platform is lower compared to the pure CNT material, but HEME has the lowest first lap charge voltage. It indicates that both HEME and HEME-GO materials act as cathode catalysts to reduce the overpotential, proving that the heme-based materials have good catalytic activity. And by comparing the cycling

curves of pure carbon nanotubes, heme catalyst, and HEME-GO catalyst in the 20th turn of Fig. 4c, we found that after 20 cycles of charging and discharging, the HEME-GO batteries has the minimum charging potential and the maximum discharging potential and the overpotential is the smallest (about 1.1 V) among the three positive electrodes. As for the HEME material, after 20 cycles, both the charging platform and the discharging platform have certain advantages compared to the pure carbon nanotube cathode, but there is a considerable gap compared to the composite material HEME-GO. We believe that the reason is that heme will fail to shed during the reaction process, and both the active site and the ability to scavenge superoxide radicals are difficult to be maintained at the reaction interface Maintenance. The use of graphene composite can structurally support heme, which can ensure that the active site always functions at the three-phase interface and suppress the generation of high-potential by-products by scavenging ROS, resulting in better cycling stability and lower reaction overpotential of the battery. On the other hand,  $\pi$ - $\pi$  interactions were activated between heme and graphene, and the OER/ORR performance was significantly enhanced, thus reducing the charge/discharge overpotential. As can be seen from the long cycle diagram, the batteries can only run for about 150 h without HEME-GO compared to the stable cycle of more than 480 h with HEME-GO as a catalyst (see Fig. S1 in the Supporting Information). Similarly, the multiplicity test curve (Fig. S2) clearly shows that the HEME-GO material has a higher and more stable discharge plateau and has a higher reversibility compared to the HEME material. At high current densities, the HEME material is less stable, and the graphene structure provides support and stability to HEME-GO, which exhibits superior performance.

To characterize the effect of different materials on the electrochemical interface, Fig. 4d shows the EIS results of pure carbon nanotubes, heme, and HEME-GO as cathode materials for Li-O<sub>2</sub> batteries. As can be seen from the figure, the pure CNT batteries have the largest charge transfer impedance Rct (about 310  $\Omega$  cm²), presumably because as the reaction proceeds, insulating by-products and lithium peroxide not decomposed in time accumulate, blocking the carbon pores, and the resulting discharge products impede the

transfer of oxygen and lithium ions to electrode, 42 leading to a gradual increase in battery impedance. As the charge/discharge cycle proceeds, the discharge capacity and cycle life of the Li-O<sub>2</sub> batteries decrease significantly with the increase in internal resistance. The batteries using both HEME and HEME-GO as catalysts showed some reduction in Rct's, from 240  $\Omega$  cm<sup>-2</sup> for the HEME material to  $58 \,\Omega\,\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$  for the HEME-GO composite. Although the low electrical conductivity of the heme material itself leads to high impedance, the use of heme-based materials as electrode materials scavenges the superoxide radicals generated during the reaction, thus avoiding most of the side reactions at the reaction interface, accelerating the electrochemical reaction of the batteries, and facilitating the charge transfer and transmission. In contrast, the Li-O<sub>2</sub> batteries with HEME-GO composite have the smallest Rct among all batteries, partly because of the accelerated electron transfer due to the high conductivity of graphene after the modification of the electrode by the graphene-heme composite, and partly because of the  $\pi$ - $\pi$  interaction that predicts a better electrode reaction kinetics for the ORR and OER performed on the porous cathode of this batteries. For higher graphene composites with better conductivity as cathodes, we used the DC four-probe method to accurately determine the resistivity and conductivity of the materials, and the standard four-probe test results are shown in Fig. 4e. Compared with pure CNT (85.45 s cm<sup>-1</sup>) and HEME (93.46 s cm<sup>-1</sup>) as positive materials, the HEME-GO catalyst material has a higher conductivity (128.2 s cm<sup>-1</sup>). In addition, we can also see from the figure that the resistivity of the HEME-GO cathode (7.8 m $\Omega$  cm) is also much smaller than that of the pure CNT (10.7 m $\Omega$  cm) and HEME (11.7 m $\Omega$  cm) cathode materials. This is consistent with the results obtained by our EIS.

To better elucidate the chemical changes of heme molecules in different electrochemical states during the redox process, we performed CV on lithium-air batteries with different cathodes (pure carbon nanotubes, heme, and HEME-GO). Figure 4f shows the CV curves of CNT, HEME, HEME-GO are used as the cathode material, the positions of the oxidation and reduction peaks of the curves are not obvious and the geometric area of the curves is smaller, indicating that the pure carbon nanotube material has a

weaker ability to catalyze the ORR and OER, and the battery capacity is smaller. For the battery using heme as catalyst, we can find obvious oxidation peak A and reduction peak B appearing in the CV curve, but the area of the curve is smaller, indicating that the OER performance and ORR performance have been improved, but the heme discharge capacity needs to be improved; while the CV test curve of HEME-GO cathode shows reduction peak D and obvious oxidation peak C, and the geometric area of the curve is also maximum, the battery using HEME-GO as catalyst has better reversibility and significantly improved electrochemical capacity and ORR performance, which is consistent with the conclusion from our cyclic and deep charge/discharge tests.

Cathode characterization after the reaction.—SEM characterization of the different cathodes after 20 electrochemical cycles also exhibited a large difference in reversibility. As shown in Fig. 5a, the SEM image of the HEME-GO batteries after 20 cycles can clearly show the original morphology of carbon nanotubes, while the SEM image of the pure carbon nanotube cathode Fig. 5b shows that the cathode surface is almost covered by a large number of solid products, and it is difficult to observe the morphology of MWCNTs. These solid by-products (mainly Li<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, HCO<sub>2</sub>Li and CH<sub>3</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>Li, as confirmed by the XPS results below) are insulating materials that ultimately lead to degraded batteries cycling performance.

To elucidate the role of the HEME-GO, XPS analysis was performed on the samples of pure CNT cathode and composite cathode after the 20th discharge, respectively. The anti-product C1s spectrum of the cathode showed three growth peaks at 286.2 eV, 289.0 eV and 289.8 eV (Fig. 5a), attributed to ether/alcoholate, carboxylate and carbonate, respectively. These peaks are a combination of irreversible discharge products such as Li<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, HCO<sub>2</sub>Li, CH<sub>3</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>Li and polyether/ether. All these products are

associated with the decomposition of the electrolyte, binder and carbonaceous cathode by nucleophilic attack of superoxide radicals. The generation of by-products is clearly shown in XPS plot 5. (c) and (d) after 20 cycles for the pure CNT electrode, however, the intensity of the growth peaks associated with the formation of discharge products in the XPS plots are all much smaller than that of the cathode of the pure CNT material due to the free radical scavenging effect of the heme composite. The same results can be obtained from the XPS plot (see Fig. S3 in the Supporting Information), where the intensity of the O1s peak is stronger for the cathode of pure CNT than for the cathode of HEME-GO material.

#### Discussion

Battery kinetic processes involve electrochemically catalyzed oxidation and reduction reactions with numerous influencing factors, and purely experimental and characterization methods can only explain the phenomena, making it difficult to study the catalytic mechanism in depth. Theoretical calculations are indispensable and important tools in understanding the mechanism of electrocatalytic activity and the intrinsic influencing factors. Therefore, the authors used the first principles to computationally investigate the four-electron reaction pathway and catalytic mechanism of HEME-GO as a catalyst for lithium-oxygen batteries.

Adsorption of reaction intermediates.—The catalytic process at the cathode of non-aqueous lithium-oxygen batteries involves the transfer of multiple electrons, so a clear understanding of the electronic properties of the catalytic material is essential. It has been shown that if graphene is used as a substrate for ORR catalysts must activate inert carbon  $\pi$  electrons to improve the reaction

efficiency.[45](#page-11-39) Based on this law, we calculated the charge density distributions of GO, HEME and HEME-GO, as shown in Fig. [6.](#page-7-0) For GO in this Fig. [6](#page-7-0)a, the electrons are mainly distributed between the C–C bonds and rarely appear in the centre of the polygon. The situation of HEME-GO is slightly different from that of GO, indicating that the electrons are redistributed on the HEME surface. Combined with the differential charge density (Fig. S4a) plot we can clearly see that the two materials HEME and GO undergo a significant charge transfer after recombination. The localized electrons accumulation at the central Fe ion site is supposed to enhance the ORR and ORR catalytic activity. For the optimized structure of HEME-GO, the centre-of-mass distance between the upper HEME and the lower GO is about 3.33 Å, which is consistent with the standard distance of π-π interaction (3.3 Å−3.8 Å), and the optimized structure is shown in Fig. [6d](#page-7-0). Compared with the preoptimization Fig. [6e](#page-7-0). A significant lateral side shift occurred, indicating that the optimized structure is consistent with the π-π interaction misaligned face-to-face F-type stacking. Thus, the Fe porphyrin material complexed with graphene can greatly activate the inert π-electrons, generating more reactive sites and thus potentially enhancing the catalytic activity. Furthermore, the formation energy (Ef) of GO, HEME and HEME-GO were 9.30 eV, 7.21 eV and 4.38 eV, respectively. HEME-GO had the lowest formation energy among all catalytic substrates, indicating its high experimental feasibility.

Unlike the intercalation mechanism of Li-ion batteries, Li-O2 batteries are based on a four-electron pathway ORR/OER process,[46](#page-11-40),[47](#page-11-41) and the specific primitive reactions can be divided into the Eqs. 5–7. Where the label "\*" indicates the adsorption state on the catalyst surface. In Li-O2 batteries, the actual energy density is closely related to the degree of Li2O2 filling in the cathode void during the discharge process, which is highly dependent on the lithium-oxygen reaction and the growth mechanism of Li2O2. Formation and growth of Li2O2 discharge products affect the reversibility of oxygen evolution and reduction reactions in Li-O2 cells.[48,](#page-11-42)[49](#page-11-43) Therefore, by calculating the preferential adsorption behaviour of oxygen molecules and lithium atoms on the adsorbed substrate, it is possible to understand the initial path of Li2O2 formed on the cathode of HEME-GO.[50](#page-11-44) According to the four-electron reaction mechanism, there are two possible pathways for the formation of Li2O2. One is O2→LiO2→Li2O2 for O2 preferential adsorption, and the other is Li→LiO2→Li2O2 for Li preferential adsorption. In all Li/O2 adsorption cases, the most stable adsorption conformation is selected according to the calculated adsorption energy, and the corresponding adsorption conformation is shown in Fig. [7](#page-8-0) (for better display of the conformation, the GO part of the upper view of the HEME-GO structure is shown by the line structure).

For pristine graphene, the optimal adsorption sites for isolated Li atoms and O2 molecules on graphene were first tested and determined. The lowest energy adsorption site for Li atoms and O2 molecules is directly above the center of the carbon ring, and the adsorption energy of Li atoms is larger compared to that of O2 molecules. On the other hand, the adsorption energy of oxygen on the surface of graphene material is small, the electron distribution around the oxygen molecule is less changed, and the bond length between O–O does not change significantly after the oxygen adsorption process. This indicates that the O2 molecule is very unstable on the pristine graphene, which is consistent with previous reports.[51](#page-11-45) Combined with the experimental data, it can be analyzed that the graphene material itself does not have good chemical catalytic activity for both OER and ORR processes in the electrochemical process because oxygen occurs on the surface of the graphene material by physical adsorption. As for HEME and HEME-GO, by calculating the adsorption energies of isolated Li atoms and O2 molecules on the three catalyst substrates, the results are shown in Table [I](#page-8-1). It can be found that the results have the same trend as graphene, both of which are larger for Li atoms, and by analyzing the stable adsorption structures, combined with the calculated adsorption energies. It can be concluded that, for GO, HEME and HEME-GO, the first step of the ORR-catalyzed process is binding to Li atoms. Therefore, in GO, HEME and HEME-GO, the pathway for the formation of Li2O2 on the cathode can be determined as Li → LiO2 → Li2O2.

On this basis, the initial growth and nucleation processes of the cathode discharge products of lithium-oxygen batteries were further analyzed to understand the growth mechanism of the cathode discharge products of lithium-oxygen batteries in detail. The reaction generates Li2O2 as an intermediate that can be easily clustered into (Li2O2)2 clusters. Therefore, the nucleation process of intact (Li2O2)2 clusters was investigated for GO, HEME and HEME-GO. In the next ORR step, the specific cluster formation paths are determined in terms of energy by

comparing the adsorption of reaction intermediates to lithium atoms and oxygen molecules, and the stabilization of  $(Li_2O_2)_2$  growth paths on different substrates is schematically shown in Fig. 8. For the GO and HEME-GO structures, after  $Li_2O_2^*$ , the adsorption energy calculation leads to a more favourable binding of  $Li^+$  than  $O_2$  molecules, resulting in the formation of  $Li_3O_2^*$ . Then, the second  $O_2$  molecule has a stronger energetic advantage over  $Li^+$  in binding to  $Li_3O_2^*$ , resulting in the formation of  $Li_3O_4^*$ . Therefore, the optimal pathway for adsorption is determined energetically as  $Li^* \rightarrow LiO_2^* \rightarrow Li_2O_2^* \rightarrow Li_3O_2^* \rightarrow Li_3O_4^* \rightarrow (Li_2O_2)_2^*$ . As for HEME, after the formation of  $Li_3O_2^*$ , the adsorption of  $Li^+$  is more advantageous than oxygen molecules, and the final cluster formed is  $(Li_2O)_2$ , which is also the same as the calculations of other researchers. The complete reaction pathway of HEME is obtained by calculating the adsorption energy as  $Li^* \rightarrow LiO_2^* \rightarrow Li_2O_2^* \rightarrow Li_3O_2^* \rightarrow (Li_2O)_2^*$ .

In addition to the high catalytic performance of cathode catalysts, their stability in use is also closely related to their practical applications. For Li-O<sub>2</sub> batteries using carbon-based cathode catalysts, another issue to be considered is the formation of Li<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>-like by-products, which may lead to higher charging voltages. It is therefore necessary to explore whether Li<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> is formed on the catalyst surface. According to previous studies, graphene-based materials<sup>53</sup> are prone to the formation of (C-O) radicals during the reaction, and the rupture of the intermediate O-O bond during the ORR process can also lead to the formation of CO<sub>3</sub> groups.<sup>54</sup> Therefore, the growth of  $-CO_3$  groups on the catalyst surface was systematically investigated by analyzing the optimized structure during the ORR process. It can be seen from Fig. 8 that the O-related intermediates in the reaction process are mainly bound to the porphyrin part of HEME-GO, and the binding sites are all located near the Fe active center, and this indirect binding of O<sub>2</sub> molecules to C atoms can effectively avoid the appearance of too many C-O radicals and thus inhibit the formation of Li<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>.

Discharge/charge process and the overpotentials.—The thermodynamic free energy diagram along the optimal reaction path was calculated by analyzing the stable structure. In this system, Ueq is the equilibrium potential that makes the ORR/OER occur spontaneously ( $\Delta G \leq 0$ ),  $U_{DC}$  and  $U_{C}$  denote the maximum discharge voltage and minimum charge voltage that keeps the thermodynamic free energy decreasing for each ORR/OER path,  $U_{DC}$  is the electrode potential when all ORR in the free energy diagram are strongly downhill from left to right, and  $U_{C}$  is the electrode potential when all OER in the free energy diagram are strongly uphill from left to right

electrode potentials. The free energy calculations for ORR/OER at zero potential (U = 0 V, equilibrium potential (Ueq), discharge potential (U $_{\rm DC}$ ) and charge potential (U $_{\rm C}$ ) are shown in Fig. 9. In the ORR pathway, the maximum discharge potential (U $_{\rm DC}$ ) is calculated in the order of GO (1.58 V) < HEME (1.84 V) < HEME-GO (2.18 V), and in the OER pathway, the minimum charge potential (U $_{\rm C}$ ) is in the order of HEME-GO (3.38) = HEME (3.38 V) < GO (3.48 V), and the HEME-GO The charge and discharge potentials are all in the actual potential range (2–4.5 V) measured for Li-O $_{\rm D}$  batteries. The charge and lower charging voltage than other cathode catalyst (GO, HEME) materials, and has the potential to be a new type of cathode catalyst with high catalytic activity.

In addition to the charge/discharge voltage levels, to compare the catalytic effect of materials, the catalytic activity and cycling efficiency are usually evaluated using the actual potential and the overpotential of ORR/OER obtained from the equilibrium potential. In general, the lower the overpotential value, the higher the catalytic activity and the higher the cycling efficiency. The calculated ORR overpotential ( $\eta_{ORR}$ ) was defined as  $\eta_{ORR} = \text{Ueq-U}_{DC}$ , while the OER overpotential ( $\eta_{OER}$ ) was defined as  $\eta_{OER} = U_C$  – Ueq. The details of the overpotential and adsorption energy are shown in Table S1. The results show that the order of discharge overpotential  $\eta_{\rm ORR}$  is HEME-GO (0.67 V) < HEME (0.86 V) < GO (1.28 V), while the order of charge overpotential  $\eta_{OER}$  is HEME-GO (0.53 V) < HEME (0.67 V) < GO (0.78 V), indicating that HEME-GO is a non-aqueous Li-O<sub>2</sub> battery is the most active process for the ORR/ OER reaction. By calculating the total overpotential of the reaction process, it can be obtained that the total overpotential of GO, HEME and HEME-GO as the positive electrode is 1.91 V, 1.53 V and 1.21 V, respectively, compared with the other two materials, the HEME-GO catalyst has the lowest charge/discharge overpotential and has higher catalytic activity and cycling efficiency in the ORR/ OER reaction. The reason is presumed to be the  $\pi$ - $\pi$  interaction between heme and graphene, which activates inert carbon  $\pi$ -electrons to improve the catalytic performance and thus reduce the battery reaction overpotential. The calculated minimum overpotential of 1.21 V is very close to the experimental value, indicating that the calculated results are more reliable. It is worth noting that the comparative values of ORR/OER overpotential are obtained by the same theoretical calculation method we used, which may not be directly equivalent to the experimental setting, but the theoretical trend and experimental parameters are consistent and are worthy of reference.

The adsorption energy of the intermediate product has a great influence on the whole redox reaction process. If the adsorption energy is too high, it will cause the product to difficult to participate in the subsequent reaction steps, resulting in a high discharge overpotential. If the adsorption energy is too low the product is difficult to adsorb to the substrate surface, which still leads to a high discharge overpotential. Whereas the adsorption energy of reaction intermediates is difficult to characterise experimentally, it is essential to explore the characteristic parameters of materials that can

describe the catalytic activity.<sup>56</sup> To further investigate the reasons for the low HEME-GO overpotential, the possible factors affecting the ORR/OER overpotential were investigated by calculating the adsorption energy (Eads) of the intermediate. An important parameter to evaluate the catalytic activity is the limiting reaction potential barrier, which is determined by the free energy of the rate-determining step (RDS). In the ORR pathway, the ratedetermining step for HEME is  $\text{Li}_3\text{O}_2^* + (\text{Li}^+ + \text{e}^-) \rightarrow \text{Li}_4\text{O}_2^*$ , where the adsorption energy of  $\text{Li}_3\text{O}_2^*$  is a determinant of  $\eta_{\text{ORR}}$ , and for and HEME-GO the RDS is  $*+2O_2+4(Li^++e^-)$  $\rightarrow$ LiO<sub>2</sub>\*+(Li<sup>+</sup>+e<sup>-</sup>), where the LiO<sub>2</sub>\* adsorption energy is the determinant of  $\eta_{ORR}$ . For the OER pathway, RDS for HEME is  $Li_{3}O_{2}*+(Li^{+}+e^{-}) \ \rightarrow Li_{2}O_{2}*+2(Li^{+}+e^{-}) \ (dissociation \ of \ Li_{3}O_{2}),$ where the adsorption energy of Li<sub>3</sub>O<sub>2</sub>\* is a determinant of  $\eta_{OER}$ , and RDS for GO and HEME-GO is the dissociation of (Li<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>\*  $(\text{Li}_2\text{O}_2)_2^* \rightarrow \text{Li}_3\text{O}_2^* + (\text{Li}^+ + \text{e}^-)$ , where the adsorption energy of  $(\text{Li}_2\text{O}_2)_2^*$  is the determinant of  $\eta_{\text{OER}}$ . Therefore, the relationship between the ORR/OER overpotential and the adsorption energy of intermediates (LiO<sub>2</sub>\* and Li<sub>3</sub>O<sub>2</sub>\*) was established, and it can be seen from Table S1 that the Eads values are all negative, indicating that the adsorption behaviours are all exothermic processes.

The correlation coefficients between the adsorption energy and ORR/OER overpotential were calculated according to Table S1. The correlation coefficients between the adsorption energy of LiO<sub>2</sub>\* and  $\eta_{\rm ORR}$  and  $\eta_{\rm OER}$  were 0.983 and 0.999, respectively, while the correlation coefficients between the adsorption energy of Li<sub>3</sub>O<sub>2</sub>\* and  $\eta_{\rm ORR}$  and  $\eta_{\rm OER}$  were 0.584 and 0.426, respectively. by analyzing the correlation between the adsorption energies of the two intermediates It can be found that the adsorption energy of LiO<sub>2</sub>\* has a more direct and important effect on the redox overpotential, and the lower adsorption energy of LiO<sub>2</sub>\* leads to a lower  $\eta_{\rm ORR}/\eta_{\rm OER}$  and a higher ORR/OER catalytic activity. The analysis of the relationship between the potential and the adsorption energy of the intermediates in Fig. 10 shows that the adsorption energy of the RDS intermediates serves to reduce  $\eta_{\rm ORR}/\eta_{\rm OER}$  by affecting their subsequent reactions, which can be

<span id="page-10-0"></span>Figure 9. Thermodynamic free energy diagram of(a) GO, (b) HEME, (c) HEME-GO at zero potential (U = 0 V), equilibrium potential (Ueq), discharge potential (UDC) and charging potential (UC) for ORR/OER.

used as a descriptor of the ORR/OER overpotential. As shown in Fig. [10](#page-10-1), both ηOER and ηORR decrease with increasing adsorption energy, with a minimum at HEME-GO. Based on the above analysis, it can be found that the adsorption energy of intermediates in RDS has a positive effect on reducing ηORR/ηOER by affecting their subsequent reactions. The relatively low adsorption energy in RDS can increase the chance of Li2O2 participating in the subsequent reactions, which can be used as a good descriptor of the ORR/ OER superpotential.

#### Conclusions

In summary, we proposed a new strategy to synthesize hemegraphene composite catalysts by a one-step hydrothermal method and confirmed the successful composite of the two materials by TEM and UV–vis. This composite has both the ability of heme natural molecules to scavenge superoxide radicals and good catalytic properties. On the one hand, SEM and XPS results show that the presence of HEME-GO reduces the attack on electrolyte and cathode by scavenging superoxide radicals, resulting in a more stable cycle

life of the battery, and the reduction of side reactions also provides more storage space for the product Li2O2, resulting in a higher discharge capacity (7770 mAh g−<sup>1</sup> ) of the battery. On the other hand, we also found that the HEME-GO materials exhibit excellent catalytic performance when compounded together through π-π interactions, which reduce the overpotential by 0.6 V compared to pure carbon nanotube electrodes in stable charge/discharge cycling states. The DFT-based study supported the experimental results by calculating the adsorption energies of Li and O2 to determine the ORR/OER processes and product formation pathways in the fourelectron pathway, where the free energy calculations showed that HEME-GO exhibited the lowest ORR overpotential (0.67 V) and OER overpotential (0.53 V) and was an excellent ORR and OER catalyst for non-aqueous lithium-oxygen batteries. Further calculations of the adsorption behavior of the reaction products in RDS in relation to the overpotential explain the high catalytic activity of HEME-GO by the intrinsic factors of the material. Our experiments and calculations reveal a simple and sustainable path to energy development-combining biochemistry with advanced energy storage in a battery system.

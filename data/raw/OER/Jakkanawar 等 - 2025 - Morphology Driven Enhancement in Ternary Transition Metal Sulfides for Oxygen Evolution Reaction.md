# Morphology Driven Enhancement in Ternary Transition Metal Sulfides for Oxygen Evolution Reaction

Shravani S. Jakkanawar, Aakanksha A. Sajane, Tejasveeni S. Bhat, and Hemraj M. Yadav\*

Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is an important half-reaction in water splitting for sustainable hydrogen generation, yet overcoming its sluggish kinetics remains a significant challenge. The spinel structure of ternary transition metal sulfides (TTSs) has gained lots of attention due to their noteworthy electrochemical properties, such as electrical conductivity, surface flexibility, thermal stability, and catalytic activity. The morphologies of nanostructures are critically important for several reasons, as they directly influence the physical, chemical, mechanical, and catalytic properties of the material. Even though the spinel structure intrinsically has a unique framework and specific arrangement of metal ions, which enhances the catalytic performance. This review focuses on the morphology and electrocatalytic activity of recently reported TTS electrocatalysts for OER. Two-dimensional materials resulted in excellent OER performance due to their improved surface area and catalytically active sites. For example, a recent study reported that the NiCo<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub>/ZnS nanosheets exhibited a low overpotential of 140 mV at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> with a small Tafel slope of 47 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>, highlighting their potential for efficient and stable OER applications. In addition, the heterostructure TTS composite shows greater catalytic activity because it produces interfaces to enhance the OER efficiency. This review summarizes the correlation between morphology and catalytic activity of spinel compounds, giving insight to elucidate strategies for the development of high-performance catalysts for OER.

## 1. Introduction

Increasing energy demand and continued environmental pollution necessitate new and improved energy storage and conversion systems. To overcome these challenges, we need to produce clean and renewable energy from combustion fuel, burning biomass, and water splitting, as well as having a replacement for the conventional fossil fuel. Water splitting is one of the best approaches to making pure hydrogen, which occurs as follows:  $2H_2O \rightarrow 2H_2 + O_2$ . It includes two main electrochemical reactions: the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Hydrogen

is an effective and versatile energy carrier that retains more renewable energy; therefore, implementing a framework for the sustainable production of  $H_2$  using the HER process is essential. [6–9] On the contrary, OER is a half-reaction process that is required for renewable energy systems like fuel cells and metal–air batteries. However, there are some barriers that occur during the OER reaction and which sluggish the overall efficiency of the water-splitting process. [10] Therefore, it is required to develop novel and alternative approaches for highly efficient OER catalysts.

As we all know, catalysts play an important role in increasing reaction kinetics. In the past, noble metal-based oxides such as ruthenium oxide (RuO<sub>2</sub>) and iridium oxide (IrO<sub>2</sub>) were utilized as electrocatalysts for OER in both acidic and alkaline electrolytes.<sup>[11]</sup> However, this precious metal oxide is mainly unstable at high anodic potential, where it is quickly oxidized and dissolves in solution.<sup>[12]</sup> Consequently, researchers have developed metal oxides, hydroxides, phosphides, nitrides, and chalcogenides.<sup>[13–17]</sup> Recently, they have gained lots of attention

on transition metal oxides in a variety of structural families, including perovskite, spinel, and layer structure types because of their low cost, catalytic activity, and abundance in the earth's crust. [18–20] Spinel structure with the formula  $XY_2O_4$  (X and Y = cations of different elements) belongs to the cubic crystal system, in which X cations occupy tetrahedral sites and Y cations occupy octahedral sites. [21–26] These spinel structure compounds are used in various reduction and oxidation reactions, including  $NO_{\rm x}$  reduction,  $CO_2$  reduction, CO oxidation, alcohol oxidation, formaldehyde oxidation, urea oxidation, glucose oxidation, HER, and OER. [27–35]

In spinel-structured compounds, sulfide-based spinels, which are generally denoted by the general formula  $XY_2S_4$ , are created when sulfur is substituted for oxygen. While noble metal oxides such as  $RuO_2$  and  $IrO_2$  are traditionally used as benchmark OER catalysts, ternary transition metal sulfides (TTSs) such as  $CuCo_2S_4$ ,  $NiCo_2S_4$ ,  $MnCo_2S_4$ , and  $CoNi_2S_4$  have an additional advantage in improving OER electrochemical performance due to their higher electrical conductivity, thermal stability, surface flexibility, and inherent catalytic activity. [36–39] For instance, under similar conditions,  $RuO_2$  usually displayed overpotentials

[40] Catalytic performance of TTSs can be improved through doping, composite synthesis, and surface modification, making them both effective and cost-effective. [41] Morphology plays an important role in improving catalyst performance in OER by customizing the shape and structure of nanomaterials. Several parameters influence the morphology of materials during synthesis, including temperature, pressure, precursor concentration, additives, and reaction time. These parameters enable fine control of TTS shape, increasing their catalytic efficacy for OER. [42]

Different dimensions of TTS, such as 0D, 1D, 2D, and 3D, have great control over the electronic properties of the material. The size of a specific surface area of material is directly dependent on its structure, which in turn impacts the contact between the electrode and electrolyte. Moreover, different morphologies offer distinct transmission channels, optimizing the material performance for various applications. TTSs have various kinds of morphologies, including nanoparticles, nanowires, and nanosheets, and each morphological form has significant advantages: Nanoparticles have many active sites and improve reaction kinetics due to their narrow diffusion channels; nanowires and nanotubes have large surface areas and direct electron paths; and nanosheets have high surface areas and rapid ion transport capabilities. Besides these morphologies, heterostructure TTSs offer a synergistic effect by combining materials with distinct properties, which improves catalytic

activity. [49–51] Therefore, researchers aim to create material with a huge surface area, numerous active spots, and enhanced ion diffusion.

Here, we demonstrate the development of spinel structures of TTS catalysts for OER. In addition, we present OER mechanisms and a brief discussion on material morphology. It also investigates various morphologies of TTS, which contribute outstandingly low overpotential, low Tafel slope, and high stability. As a result, this review provides insight into how morphology affects catalyst characteristics and activity.

## 2. OER Mechanism

OER is the fundamental electrochemical process in water splitting that involves the generation of oxygen  $(O_2)$  from water  $(H_2O)$ at the anode. OER is occurs by different mechanisms, including adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM), lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM), and oxide pair mechanism (OPM). The mechanisms influenced by various factors, that is, catalyst material, lattice structure, electrolyte pH, surface properties, overpotential, and stability. [52] The morphology of electrocatalysts plays an important role in determining their OER mechanism pathway

by influencing surface area, active site exposure, electrolyte infiltration, and gas release. 1D structures such as nanoneedles can enhance intermediate adsorption and desorption steps in the oxygen evolution mechanism. Due to the high aspect ratio and directivity of the nanoneedle, it provides rapid electron transfer and facile ion diffusion. 2D structure-like nanosheets can provide a high surface area to contact with the electrolyte and thus the beneficial for the reaction between reactants and catalysts because they have a large lateral size. In these structures, more atoms are exposed as active sites due to their ultrathin structure. While the 3D structures provide more actives sites for better efficiency.[53]

The best OER activity is obtained by maintaining a mild binding strength of the reaction intermediate to the active site, which allows the adsorption/desorption to approach equilibrium. AEM serves as an intermediary for adsorption energy. In the AEM process, the majority of the oxygen is obtained from absorbed water molecules, and the adsorption energies of oxygenated intermediate binding species show a scaling relationship. Although its limitations in OER activity have not yet been addressed, the

scaling relationship in AEM can aid in the quick evaluation of catalysts.<sup>[54-56]</sup> Basically, OER proceeds differently depending on the pH conditions (acidic and alkaline conditions):

In acidic media

$$2H_2O \rightarrow 2H_2 + O_2$$

In alkaline media

$$4OH^- \rightarrow O_2 \ + \ 2H_2O + 4e^- \quad 0.40 \ vs. \ SHE$$

The mechanism of OER in acidic media includes water adsorption and deprotonation, formation of adsorbed O2, O2 formation and release of molecular O2, while in alkaline media includes hydroxide adsorption, formation of adsorbed O2, formation of peroxo species and release of molecular O2. IrO2 and RuO<sub>2</sub> are used as catalysts in acidic media because of their strong stability and antiacid corrosion properties. [57-60] However, other metals, transition metals, and their hydroxides, sulfides, phosphides, and oxides are employed in alkaline media due to their inadequate resistance to acid corrosion.<sup>[11]</sup> Here, we are focused on the TTSs for OER, which occur in alkaline media and follow this path

$$M + OH^- \rightarrow M - OH_{ads} + e^-$$

$$M - OH_{ads} + OH^- \rightarrow M - O_{ads} + H_2O + e^-$$

$$M - O_{ads} + OH^- \rightarrow M - OOH_{ads} + e^-$$

$$M-\mathsf{OOH}_{\mathsf{ads}}+\mathsf{OH}^-\to M+\mathsf{O}_2+\mathsf{H}_2\mathsf{O}+e^-$$

where, M is the active site of the catalyst surface and ads represents the adsorption species on the catalyst surface. [14] Initially, hydroxide ions adsorb onto the surface of metal, forming M-OH<sub>ads</sub>. Intermediate M-O<sub>ads</sub> are formed by the reaction of M-OH<sub>ads</sub> with OH<sup>-</sup>, and subsequently combined with another OH to produce M-OOH<sub>ads</sub>. Finally, M-OOH<sub>ads</sub> reacts with  $OH^-$  to release the  $O_2$  gas and regenerate the catalyst surface. The overpotential is required to overcome the activation barrier of each step. Therefore, a catalyst is essential to lowering the activation barrier, increasing reaction rates and utilizing more abundant materials.

To correlate the morphology and electronic structure of catalysts with their catalytic behavior, in situ characterisation techniques including X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), UV-Vis spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) are frequently used.

This provides a more thorough understanding of the stability and activity of the catalysts during OER. Furthermore, the integration of several in-situ characterization methodologies with electrochemical experiments has yielded a deep insight into intermediate species production, oxidation state change, structural reconstruction and coordination within catalysts. For OER catalyst, XRD provides the analysis of unit cell parameters, crystallization type, and phase transition according to the position of diffraction peaks and their shifts. It also determined the material crystallinity, crystal defects, and size. In-situ XRD studies elucidate the dynamic evolution process of the observation unit during the water oxidation reaction process.  $^{[62-65]}$  A lot of work has been done using UV-Vis spectroscopy to study how changes in the electronic structure of metal ions are directly related to changes in their coordination environment and oxidation state. Raman spectroscopy has been beneficial to analyze the phase transitions and structural modifications of metal hydroxides and oxides when combined with electrochemical reactions.<sup>[66]</sup> While in-situ FTIR has been used to study the microstructure and reactivity of materials and explore the reaction mechanism due to its advantages of high sensitivity and fast characterization. In-situ XPS plays a vital role in determining the catalytic mechanism, analyzing the evolution of material valence states and electron transfer behavior. [67] The distribution of nearby atoms during electrochemical reactions and the study of metal oxidation states have been made possible

using insitu XAS. As the potential rises, XAS investigations have revealed variations in oxidation states and metal—oxygen link lengths, underscoring the impact of guest metal ion insertion on the host materials redox behavior. Furthermore, the distinction between bulk metal sites that are electrochemically active and those that are not has been made possible using XAS data. [66]

A comprehensive understanding of the reaction mechanism and the logical design of high-performance catalysts can be obtained by combining such characterization methods with computational investigations such as density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Adsorption characteristics have a significant impact on the durability, selectivity, and activity of catalysts in an electrocatalytic reaction. Adsorption energies of intermediates, active site configurations, activation energy barriers, and reaction route preferences and processes can all be computed using DFT. [68] DFT calculation provides insights into how morphology influences the electronic structure and surface reactivity of electrocatalysts. Additionally, it elucidates the role of heterointerfaces and strong interfacial interactions between materials, which can enhance OER activity. [69] Sethulakshmi et al. demonstrated via DFT calculations that hydroxyl adsorption occurs preferentially on spinel CuCo<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub>, specifically on Co ions, while Cu ions do not directly participate in hosting the surface species.<sup>[70]</sup> Shen et al. provided further insight into the effect of heterointerfaces (NiCo2S4/CoFeMo-LDH) and

Mo atom doping on the enhancement of OER performance. While the DFT calculation confirmed that this composite catalyst could create beneficial electronic distribution for electrochemical OER.<sup>[71]</sup> Similarly, Li et al. elucidated through DFT calculation that the effect of the heterointerface of NiCo<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub>/FeOOH on improving the OER catalytic activity. The interfacial combination of NiCo<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub> and FeOOH helps to optimize the adsorption and desorption of intermediates by contributing to the many active sites surrounding the interfaces.<sup>[72]</sup> Sun et al. revealed via DFT calculation that the built-in interfacial potential and presence of Zn defects boost catalytic performance by enhancing electron transfer and modulating the electronic structure.<sup>[73]</sup> Wang et al. described, using DFT calculations, the strong interfacial interactions between MnS<sub>x</sub>O<sub>2-x</sub> and MnCo<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub>, providing insights into the binding affinity of the Mn–Co sites toward oxygen-containing intermediates.<sup>[74]</sup>

# 3. Different Ternary Transition Metal Sulfides for OER

Table 1 depicts the list of reported TTSs, along with their morphology, synthesis method, overpotential and Tafel slope. Synthesizing TTSs with different methods such as sol-gel, coprecipitation, electrodeposition, hydrothermal, and solvothermal method is crucial because it enhances not only quantitative but also qualitative properties. Among these, hydrothermal synthesis is the most extensively practiced technique for synthesizing TTSs. This synthesis technique can produce a wide range of nanostructures, such as nanoparticles, nanorods, and nanosheets. This versatility is essential for tailoring materials for the particular application. The form of synthesized material with respect to different factors such as the type of precursor materials used, the reaction temperature and time, the addition of additives, varies with combination, and morphology.

The following classification is based on the different morphologies of TSSs for OER applications.

## 3.1. Zero-Dimensional TTSs

The large surface area-to-volume ratio and many active sites of nanoparticles help TTSs catalyze the OER more effectively. Because of their small size, which exposes more active areas for the reaction to occur, they have a wide surface area. Furthermore, nanoparticles enable effective charge transfer and quick mass transport, which enhances catalytic activity. Parale et al. prepared nano-sandwich-like structures of g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> and NiCo<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub> by sol-gel assembly, where the colloidal NiCo<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub>

www.advancedsciencenews.com nanoparticles are gathered on the g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> nanosheets. The sandwich-like structure of the composite improved OER catalytic performance with an overpotential of 294 mV at a current density of 20 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>.<sup>[75]</sup> Gao et al. synthesized porous NiCo<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub> nanoparticles (NPs) and NiCo<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub>-reduced graphene oxide (1%, 2%, and 5% r-GO mass ratio) for both OER and supercapacitor applications. Figure 1, illustrates the SEM images of the aerogel samples. NiCo<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub>-reduced graphene oxide aerogel showed higher surface area  $(262.2 \text{ m}^2 \text{ g}^{-1})$ , high pore volume  $(1.44 \text{ cm}^3 \text{ g}^{-1})$ , and small nanoparticle size ( $\approx$ 8–10 nm). Due to the large surface area and pore volume, the NiCo<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub> NPs and NiCo<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub>-reduced graphene oxide aerogel exhibit low overpotentials of 250 and 275 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, respectively. [76] Syed et al. coated CoNi<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub> nanoparticles on a PVP-modified solvent-free fullerene nanorod (sf-FNR-PVP/CoNi2S4) by using co-precipitation for OER. The material sf-FNR-PVP/CoNi<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub> has a huge electrochemical surface area and exceptional performance. [77] Liu et al. prepared hybrid NiCo<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub>@N/S-rGO as an electrocatalyst for both oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and OER. The material showed better OER performance with an overpotential of 210 mV at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> because of N and S-doping into r-GO and the coupling interaction between NiCo<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub> and r-GO.<sup>[78]</sup> a NiCo,S, Mn-NiCo.S

## 3.2. One-Dimensional TTSs

Nanowires, nanorods, nanoneedles, and nanotubes are the most common types of 1D nanostructures. Nanorods and nanowires TTSs improve performance through their elongated structure, which maximizes surface area exposure and promotes effective catalytic activity. During the OER process, resistance is decreased, and effective electron transfer is ensured by the quick charge movement along their length. Zhang et al. found that MnCo<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub> nanowires uniformly grown on Ti mesh act as an effective electrocatalyst for OER under alkaline conditions, requiring a 325 mV overpotential at 50 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>.[79] Li et al. created porous NiCo<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub>/FeOOH nanowires with rich interfaces for OER, resulting in a low overpotential of  $\approx$ 200 mV at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, a low Tafel slope and high stability. The large length-diameter ratio and porous structure of the composite make it desirable for exposing a high density of active sites and accelerating mass transfer. [72] Zhang et al. developed a CuCo<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub>@CoFe-LDH bifunctional catalyst using hydrothermal and electrodeposition methods. The porous nature of interconnected CoFe-LDH nanosheets can provide more active sites and low-resistance channels for electrolytes and reactants, which helps the diffusion of reactants. The material, which

consists of CuCo<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub> nanowires and CoFe-LDH nanosheets, exhibits excellent activity in HER and OER with overpotentials of 63 mV at  $10 \text{ mA cm}^{-2}$  and 293 mV at  $50 \text{ mA cm}^{-2}$ , respectively. [80] Biswas et al. used a simple one-step thermal decomposition method to create evenly dispersed CuCo<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub> nanorods on the surface of g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> for OER in basic and neutral conditions. Under basic media, the composite material demonstrated higher catalytic activity with a lower overpotential of 242 mV at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> when compared to neutral media.<sup>[81]</sup> Wang et al. have described hierarchical heterostructures doped with S that are induced by polysulfide (Poly(S-r-DIB)). Using an in-situ solvothermal sulphuration reaction, Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub>/NiCo<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub> were successfully produced on nickel foam (Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub>/NiCo<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub>/NF). As shown in Figure 2, Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub>/NiCo<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub> nanorods have many granular morphologies, which can expand the mass transfer channels and surface area. Based on the composite structure, Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub>/ NiCo2S4 improved catalytic activity with an overpotential of 330 mV to drive a current density of 100 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> and a low Tafel slope of 67.6 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>. [82] Wang et al. utilized a simple consecutive anion-cation exchange technique to fabricate hollow CuCo<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub> nanorods for OER. The hollow structure of material increases the number of active sites and speeds up electron transmission. It also showed an exceptional 30 h stability and a low overpotential of 220 mV at 10 mA cm  $^{-2}.^{[83]}\,$ 

The pointed, needle-like structure of TTS allows for a dense array of active surface sites, optimizing catalytic efficiency and improving performance across OER. For instance, Min et al. successfully grew vertical P-doped NiCo<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub> nanoneedles on nickel foam for OER. Based on open pore structure and zigzag flow channels (**Figure 3**), the material exhibits a large surface area, fast electron diffusion, and long-term durability over 100 h.  $^{[84]}$  Sun et al. reported that vertical growth of CuCo<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub> nanoneedles by electroplating a PANI mesh layer onto a Ni foam for efficient OER. The uniform vertical growth of material enhanced the catalytic activity with a low overpotential of 291 mV at a current density of 100 mA cm $^{-2}$  and excellent cyclic stability.  $^{[85]}$ 

The well-organized tubular structure of TTS nanotubes enables an enhancement in the catalytic activity of OER. Rapid reaction kinetics are amplified by their hollow tubular form, which offers active sites for rapid ion diffusion. For example, Wu et al. created  $\text{NiCo}_2S_4$  hollow nanotubes decorated with  $\text{CeO}_x$  nanoparticles for OER. Although  $\text{NiCo}_2S_4$  has a rougher surface and more interior pores, it improves ion exchange and increases the number of electroactive sites (**Figure 4**). The material

demonstrated catalytic activity toward OER with an overpotential of 270 mV to drive a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. [86]

#### 3.3 Two-Dimensional TTSs

TTS nanosheets, specifically in OER, improve performance due to their special structural and chemical characteristics. Their vast surface area, which results from their two-dimensional structures, maximizes the exposure of active catalytic sites and facilitates effective catalytic activity. Furthermore, significant surface roughness and well-defined crystalline facets provided by nanosheets boost catalytic activity by offering preferred locations for reactions to take place. Additionally, as they are thin and flexible, they may make direct contact with reactants, which improves interaction and encourages effective catalytic turnover. Furthermore, adjustable band structure defects intrinsic electrical features of TSS nanosheets are essential for promoting charge transfer in catalytic reactions. Liu et al. developed diamond-block structure MIL-53(Fe)@CoNi<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub>/NF as an electrocatalyst for OER. The synthesized material improved catalytic performance due to the lattice structure of MIL-53(Fe) rhombic blocks loaded on CoNi<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub> nanosheets, with an overpotential of 201 mV at a current density of 20 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> and a low Tafel slope of 33.9 mV dec<sup>-1</sup> in 1 M KOH solution.<sup>[87]</sup> Chauhan et al. successfully synthesized CuCo<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub> nanosheets with an average thickness in the range of 8-15 nm, which showed an overpotential of 310 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. [88] Sethulakshmi et al. explained

the redox interaction of metal ions in CuCo<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub> nanocoral layered nanosheets for OER. The excellent property is mainly due to the synergic effect of Co and Cu ions through a redox interaction CuCo2S4, which reveals the overpotential of 368 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. [70] Hao et al. developed self-assembled CuCo<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub> nanosheets by the solvothermal method, which only requires 269 mV overpotential at a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> and a small Tafel slope of about 41 mV dec<sup>-1</sup> in 1 M KOH solution.<sup>[89]</sup> Sun et al. constructed NiCo<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub>/ZnS heterogeneous structure for OER. The spherical ZnS is a evenly distributed on NiCo<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub> nanosheets, which promotes charge transfer and reaction kinetics with a lower overpotential of 140 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> and a low Tafel slope of 47 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>.<sup>[73]</sup> Mohammadpour and Asadpour-Zeynali have reported ZnFe2O4@ZnFe2S4 nanosheets on Ni foam, and the material showed high performance and good stability for OER. Figure 5 shows the SEM and TEM images of ZnFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> and ZnFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>@ZnFe<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub>. The remarkable properties of nanostructures are mostly owing to their coreshell nanosheets, which need an overpotential of 222 mV at 5 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> and a Tafel slope of 73 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>. [90]

Song et al. demonstrated that ZnCo<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub> nanosheet arrays anchored on nickel foam act as an electrocatalyst for water splitting. The material exhibited excellent electrocatalytic activity and stability towards OER in alkaline solution.<sup>[91]</sup> For the enhancement of catalytic performance, various metal dopants are introduced into the material, which could alter the morphology, increase the density of active sites, and improve electrical

conductivity. During OER, these modifications improve catalytic stability and efficiency. For example, Chen et al. used the hydrothermal method to dope three different metal dopants with

NiCu<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub> on nickel foam, such as Mn, Zn, Cu, and formed that Mn-doped NiCu<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub> nanosheets had the excellent OER catalytic activity, requiring overpotential of 269 mV at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> and

low Tafel slope of 55.4~mV dec $^{-1}$ . [92] Yu et al. grew Mn-NiCo $_2$ S $_4$  nanosheets on the surface of nickel foam and across-linked with each other to form a nanosphere with a network structure as an electrocatalyst for OER. As shown in **Figure 6**, the Mn-dopant can adjust the nanosheet morphology of the material, increase the active site, and enhanced the catalytic performance and durability. The material exhibited a low overpotential of 220 mV to achieve a current density of  $10~\text{mA}~\text{cm}^{-2}$  and long-term durability of 60~h. [93] Natrajan et al. synthesized sheet-like CoNi $_2$ S $_4$  material utilizing different Co/Ni molar ratio by a hydrothermal method in the alkaline medium for OER. Co/Ni ratio affected the morphology and the surface roughness of CoNi $_2$ S $_4$  material. The material delivered a smaller Tafel slope of 69~mV dec $^{-1}$ . [94]

TTS nanoflakes and nanosheets have a similar thin, twodimensional structure, there could be some differences. For example, unlike the generally uniform and continuous morphology of nanosheets, nanoflakes may show an irregular or fragmented structure. Different surface roughness characteristics between the two structures could also be the result of variations in thickness and lateral dimensions. However, large surface area exposure and well-defined crystalline facets are features shared by both nanoflakes and nanosheets, which make them efficient catalysts in OER. Yin's group designed 3D hierarchical network of NiCo2S4 nanoflakes (NiCo2S4-NF) as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for HER and OER in alkaline 1 M NaOH solution. During the sulfurization process, the vertically aligned NiCo2O4 nanosheets completely change into NiCo2S4 nanoflakes, which have a distinct layered structure and a nanoscale thickness of less than 20 nm. The ultrathin NiCo<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub> nanoflakes can provide a high surface area, large active site and fast electron transfer, which facilitate the electrocatalytic activity for both HER and OER. This material delivered overpotentials of 289 mV and 409 mV at 100 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> and a low Tafel slope of 89 and 91 mV dec<sup>-1</sup> for HER and OER, respectively. [37] Jadhav and their coworkers reported hierarchical free-standing networks of MnCo<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub> nanoflakes on SS-mesh obtained by electrodeposition for OER. Figure 7 shows TEM images of MnCo<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub> nanoflakes. These interconnected nanoparticle-filled flakes form pores that improve ion-exchange, making the MnNi<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub> material more amorphous. This improved amorphous nature boosts the conductivity and OER activity with an overpotential of 290 mV at a current density of  $10 \text{ mA cm}^{-2}$ . [95]

#### 3.4. Three-Dimensional TTSs

The currently reported 3D transition metal sulfides are a promising one because of their high OER catalytic performance. These materials have a property that boosts either their stability or the catalytic capacity resulting from the interaction of the different metal components. Thus, the nanosphere shape also allows for the use of a high number of locations for the OER because of the higher density of the surface-to-volume ratio and their inherent electrical conductivity, which facilitates the transfer of electrons. For instance, Li et al. effectively created CuCo2S4 flower-like nanospheres with particle sizes of about 100 nm for water electrolysis. The Cu/Co ratio can be adjusted in the one-step solvothermal synthesis of CuCo<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub> nanomaterials, giving fine control over their form. Figure 8 displays the SEM of CuCo<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub> nanospheres were synthesized with different percentages of Cu/Co, while Figure 9 presents TEM and HRTEM images of the CuCo<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub> with a Cu/Co ratio of 33:67. As the Cu/Co ratio decreases from 100:0 to 0:100, the structure shifts from thick, agglomerated CuS nanosheets (≈200 nm) to thinner, flower-like CuCo<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub> nanospheres (<100 nm). The CuCo<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub> (Cu/ Co = 33:67) material produced an overpotential of 182 and 274 mV for HER and OER at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, respectively. [96] Li et al. suggested a water electrolyzer that used an alkaline solution of 3D lily-like CoNi<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub> on Ni-foam as a bifunctional electrocatalyst. Increased surface roughness, more active sites, a structure of mesopores, and rapid electron diffusion were attributed to this material, which enhanced the electrochemical performance for both OER and HER. For HER and OER, the material needed an overpotential of 54 mV at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> and 328 mV at 100 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, respectively. [39] Gong et al. synthesized NiCo<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub> nanostructure with four diverse morphologies including nanoneedle, nanosheets, nanoflowers, and nanocaterpillars on Nifoam by the hydrothermal method for OER. The morphology of NiCo<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub> is influenced by using different precursors such as urea, HTMA and NH<sub>4</sub>F. NiCO<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub> nanocaterpillars obtained utilizing HTMA and NH<sub>4</sub>F exhibit excellent OER performance with overpotential of 279 mV at a current density of 50 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> and a Tafel slope of 68 mV dec<sup>-1</sup> due to the 3D interconnected structure, high surface area, elevated charge transport, and reaction kinetics.[97]

The advantages and disadvantages of various morphologies from 0D to 3D are summarized in Table 2.

Xu et al. revealed active and stable OER catalytic activity by developing chlorine-assisted CuCo<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub>@(Cu,Co)<sub>2</sub>Cl(OH)<sub>3</sub> heterostructures. The presence of chlorine in the (Cu,Co)<sub>2</sub>Cl(OH)<sub>3</sub> precursor and the mixed valence of cobalt (Co3+ in CuCo2S4 and Co<sup>2+</sup> in (Cu,Co)<sub>2</sub>Cl(OH)<sub>3</sub>) in the catalyst material result in an O-S interpenetrated nanointerface (Figure 11). These nanointerfaces enhances electron transfer and OER performance with an overpotential of 290 mV at current density of 50 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. [99] Duan et al. compared catalytic activity of Au-CoNi<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub> core-shell, Au-NiS core-shell, Au-Co<sub>3</sub>S<sub>4</sub> core-shell, and bare CoNi<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub> nanoparticles for OER. Among them, Au-CoNi<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub> core-shell shows best electrocatalytic activity due to the synergic impact of the metal-sulfide core-shell contact and bimetallic sulfide composition, which improve the reaction kinetics. Au-CoNi<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub> core-shell exhibited an overpotential of 264 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. [100] Lv et al. prepared Au@NiCo<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub> core-shell heterostructures and bare NiCo<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub> to compare the catalytic performance for OER. The overpotential of Au@NiCo2S4 (299 mV) was lower than that of bare NiCo<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub> (312 mV) at a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> due to the interaction between Au core and NiCo<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub> shell.<sup>[101]</sup>

The morphology of the material was affected by plasma treatment time, while the material exposed more active sites due to the etching of the oxide overlayer. [102] Wang et al. demonstrated that the interfacial active centers within the MnS<sub>x</sub>O<sub>x-2</sub>/MnCo<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub> heterostructure are highly beneficial for both OER and zinc-air batteries. Their findings demonstrated that the binding affinity between the catalyst and oxygen intermediates is efficiently controlled by the interfaces between the oxide and sulfide components. Moreover, MnS<sub>x</sub>O<sub>x-2</sub> and MnCo<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub> exhibit a strong interfacial contact that improves OER performance, resulting in an overpotential of 367 mV at 50 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>.<sup>[74]</sup> Wang et al. explained electron redistribution mechanism to inhibit the leaching of sulfur from CeO<sub>2</sub>/ NiCo<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub> heterostructure for OER. The NiCo<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub> nanoparticles are tightly entrenched into the surface of CeO2 nanorods, which exhibited a remarkable overpotential of 146 mV to drive the current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> and outstanding durability for over  $200 \,\mathrm{h}$  at  $500 \,\mathrm{mA \, cm^{-2}}$  (Figure 12).

The final form of NiCo<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub>@NiCoLDH nanoarrays supported on carbon cloth is strongly controlled by the initial Co/Ni molar ratio utilized in the synthesis of CoNi-LDH. With a 1:4 Co/Ni molar ratio, an overpotential of 337 mV to drive a current density of 100 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> and 40 h of durability.

electrolysis with the required overpotential of 295 mV at a current density of  $100\,\text{mA}\,\text{cm}^{-2}.^{[36]}$  Barik et al. synthesized a  $\text{ZnCo}_2\text{S}_4/\text{ZnCr}_2\text{O}_4$  nanostructure catalyst using simple hydrothermal and sol–gel methods. The material compositions were designed as ZNSCO-5, ZNSCO-10, ZNSCO-15, ZNSCO-30, and ZNSCO-45 using various concentrations of ZnCr $_2\text{O}_4$  (5, 10, 15, 30, and 45 mg), respectively. The multiple valencies of Co and Cr are beneficial for improving electronic conductivity, minimizing charge transfer, and enhancing catalytic performance. ZNSCO-15 exhibited a lower overpotential of 316 mV at a current density of  $10\,\text{mA}\,\text{cm}^{-2}$  and a low Tafel slope of  $93\,\text{mV}\,\text{dec}^{-1}$  compared to other compositions.  $^{[105]}$ 

#### 3.5.3. Microstructures

Apart from normal morphologies, unique microstructures of the material were synthesized to improve the catalytic efficiency of OER. Microstructures such as microsheets microrugby, and microflowers materials provide extensive surface area and numerous active sites, both of which are critical for catalytic reactions. For example, the surface texture of microflowers improves catalytic reaction contact, whereas nanoarrays increase electron and mass movement. The strength of diverse morphologies is combined to improve catalytic activity in a hybrid structure, which has a synergic effect. Ahmed et al. fabricated binder-free cordillera-like FeO@CuCo2S4 material for both supercapacitor and OER applications. FeO nanospheres were placed onto the surface of CuCo<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub> by magnetron sputtering after CuCo<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub> was hydrothermally synthesized on Ni-foam. The microscopic texture is shown on the surface of CuCo<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub> films, which is controlled by hydrothermal growth time. FeO@CuCo2S4 resulted remarkable specific capacitance of 3213 F  $g^{-1}$  at a current density of 20 A  $g^{-1}$  for supercapacitor while the overpotential of 240 at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> for OER.<sup>[106]</sup> Tahira et al. reported the PdO@CoNi2S4 where deposition of PdO nanoparticles of size 10 nm onto CoNi<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub> microstructure was accomplished by the UV reduction method. The PdO@CoNi2S4 enhanced catalytic properties toward OER due to the synergic effect between PdO and CoNi<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub>. This material delivered an overpotential of 230 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> in alkaline medium. [107] Lu et al. prepared CuCo<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub> material with different morphologies on carbon cloth by a hydrothermal process for OER. By adjusting the NH<sub>4</sub>F concentration between 0 and 3 mmol, the morphologies of material may be changed, leading to the production of various structures like microsheets, tightly bound microsheets, hybrid microsheets, long microwires, and short wires. Out of all of them, the long-perimeter microsheets performed better, obtaining a low Tafel slope of 89 mV dec<sup>-1</sup> and an overpotential of 283 mV at 20 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>.[108] Dia et al. developed porous coreshell MnCo<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub> microrugby balls for OER. The unique porous structure of MnCo<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub> increased surface area, exposed more surface area and conductivity, which enhances the electrocatalytic activity with an overpotential of 317 mV at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> and a low Tafel slope of 73.7 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>.[38] Ma et al. developed 3D porous microrugby balls constructed by MnCo<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub> on carbon cloth with excellent OER performance, such as low overpotential (180 mV), small Tafel slope (145.7 mV  $dec^{-1}$ ), and high

durability.<sup>[109]</sup> Abouserie et al. established the concept of ionic liquid precursors for the hierarchical synthesis of CuS and CuCo<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub> structures. The unique microflower morphology of CuCo<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub> enhanced catalytic performance towards OER.<sup>[110]</sup>

## 3.5.4. Hybrid Structures

Chowdhury et al. developed  $CuCo_2S_4@B$ , N-doped reduced graphene oxide hybrid as an electrocatalyst for both ORR and OER. The exceptional property is mainly due to the synergic effect between the  $CuCo_2S_4$  and the dual-doped reduced graphene oxide, which exhibited a large surface area, more active sites, improved electron conductivity, and enhanced the performance of the catalyst. [111]

## 4. Conclusion and Outlooks

In addition to new energy generation, the development of clean energy presents interesting application prospects. The OER is essential for various energy conversion and storage applications. Thus, it is crucial to develop an OER catalyst with high catalytic activity and good stability. Recent studies reveal that the spinelstructured TTS shows lower band energy, higher conductivity, and excellent catalytic activity. A detailed discussion of the electrochemical performance of TTS materials for OER is presented here, focusing on the effect of TTS morphology. Furthermore, the reported results illustrate a correlation between the structure of a material and its surface properties and, hence, catalytic action. The morphological characteristics of TTS material can give benefits in an increased surface area and number of active sites. This would help recognize the specific morphology that maximizes the efficiency of the catalyst. Notably, it is believed that the enhancement of the catalytic efficiency of twodimensional TTSs can be attributed to intrinsic activity, layered structure, availability of more active sites, larger surface area, and synergic tuning of electronics. Recent studies report that NiCo<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub> and NiMn<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub> nanosheet composites exhibit overpotentials below 300 mV and Tafel slopes under 50 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>, demonstrating the potential of TTS materials for efficient OER catalysis. In addition, the heterostructure TTS composite can enhance the electron transfer and reaction kinetics for OER performance due to its synergistic interfacial effects. Heterostructures can improve electronic conductivity and lower energy barriers for OER, which is critical for achieving high efficiency in water-splitting systems. For instance, the CeO<sub>2</sub>/NiCo<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub> heterostructure achieved the lowest overpotential of 146 mV at a current density of  $10 \,\mathrm{mA\,cm^{-2}}$  and a Tafel slope of  $\approx 30 \,\mathrm{mV\,dec^{-1}}$ . Therefore, the ability to analyze and enhance material morphological properties is paramount for the enhancement of OER performance.

Fabrication methods of TTS nanocomposites mainly include hydrothermal/solvothermal, electrodeposition, sol–gel, co-precipitation, etc. In order to accomplish the increasing demands of mass production and commercial application, new methods for preparing TTS nanocomposites must be investigated. Understanding the active sites in TTS for the design of new spinel catalysts has been more challenging compared to the spinel ternary transition metal oxide. Hence, the study requires

that TTS materials depend significantly on their morphology and underlying mechanisms.

For the enhancement of OER performance, researchers have to use different strategies such as morphology-controlled nanostructuring, hybrid/heterostructure formation, doping, and MOF use as a template. The distinctive nanostructure of TSS nanocomposites may allow for the enhancement of surface area and the exposure of additional active sites, making morphological optimization a viable strategy for improving the electrochemical performance of TTSs. The development of hybrid structures like core–shell TTS is a good strategy to improve conductivity, stability, and the availability of active sites. Moreover, heterostructure TTS indicates a highly efficient catalyst for OER due to its tunable electronic structure, more exposure of active sites, and improved conductivity. However, the TSS hybrid/ heterostructure synthesis is complex, and achieving consistent reproducibility on a large scale becomes difficult. Additional metal doping, or codoping, produces synergistic effects that improve catalytic efficiency, stability, and conductivity even more. For industrial applications, it is crucial to develop scalable synthesis techniques that yield doped TTSs with consistent composition and repeatability. Looking ahead, low-cost, highly active and stable TTS spinels are expected to be scaled up for electrolytic hydrogen production, which will play a vital role in meeting global energy needs.

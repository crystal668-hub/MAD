**Abstract:** Thin film of amorphous tungsten-doped cobalt oxide (W:CoO) was successfully grown on a conducting electrode *via* an electrochemical oxidation process employing a [Co(WS4)2] 2 deposition bath. The W:CoO catalyst displays attractive performance for the oxygen evolution reaction in an alkaline solution. In the pH 13 NaOH solution, the best W:CoO operates with moderate onset overpotential of 230 mV and requires 320 mV overpotential to generate a catalytic current density of 10 mA.cm-2 . Low Tafel slope of 45 mV.decade-1 was determined, indicating a rapid O2-evolving kinetics. The current W:CoO belongs to the best cobalt oxide based catalysts ever reported for the oxygen evolution reaction.

Identification of efficient and robust catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) represents a great challenge that needs to be fully addressed in order to make possible the construction of a viable (photo)electrochemical cell or artificial leaf for solar water splitting application. [1] Among the most promising OER catalysts that have been reported, the cobalt-oxide-based ones gain great attention thanks to its high activity and robustness.[2] Recently, bimetal- or trimetal- or metal-doped cobalt oxides like FeCoW,[3] CoMoO4, [4] were demonstrated to have superior catalytic activity compared with that of cobalt oxide. The incorporation of high-valence Mo6+ and W6+ dopants alters the OH adsorption energy on the cobalt oxide surface metal therefore alters the O2-evolving catalytic activity. For instance, these Mo/Wdoped cobalt oxides, either in form of nanoparticles or nanosheets, were succesfully prepared by sol-gel[3] or hydrothermal methods.[4-5] In principle, nanoparticle or nanosheet catalysts can be easily incorporated within a PEC device *via* simple methods like spin-coating, drop-casting, dip-coating *etc*. However, the resultant PEC device usually suffers of low robustness and poor electronic communication between the catalyst loaded and the light harvesting counter part. To deal with these issues,

electrodeposition and photo-assisted electrodeposition were demonstrated to be attractive alternatives for incorporating catalyst, now in the form of thin film, within a PEC device. [6] To this end, identification of OER catalyst that can be grown *via* an electrodeposition process is of great interest. Herein, we report on a scalable electrodeposition growth of a tungsten-doped cobalt oxide, hereafter denoted as W:CoO, employing an easy-prepared [Co(WS4)2] 2- deposition bath. We show that the resultant oxide belongs to the best OER catalysts made of cobalt oxides ever reported. In a pH 13 NaOH solution, the best W:CoO catalyst operated with a low onset overpotential of 230 mV and a low Tafel slope of 45 mV.decade-1 . It required 320 mV overpotential to generate a catalytic current density of 10 mA.cm-2 .

We first prepared the deposition bath by stirring (NH4)2[WS4] and two equimolar Co(NO3)<sup>2</sup> in a pH 7 phosphate buffer. It was reported that [WS4] 2- acted as a bidentate ligand and reacted with the divalent ion Co2+ generating an anionic tetrahedral complex with the CoS<sup>4</sup> central unit, namely [Co(WS4)2] 2- . [7] The resultant [Co(WS4)2] 2- solution was stable for hours without significant degradation.

**Figure 1** shows consecutive cyclic voltammograms recorded on a glassy carbon electrode immersed in a 0.5 mM [Co(WS4)2] 2 solution with a potential scan rate of 50 mV.s-1 . Two irreversible oxidation events were observed at +0.85 and +1.10 V prior to the O2-evolving catalytic wave emerged at the onset potential of +1.2 V *vs*. NHE. In a control experiment, a solution of 1 mM [WS4] 2 being free of Co2+ showed only an oxidation peak at +0.85 V *vs.* NHE. We attribute this event to an irreversible oxidation of [WS4] 2 ligand to tungsten oxide or tungstate. The event at +1.10 V *vs.* NHE is assignable to the Co3+/Co2+ couple.[8] Repeating potential cycling from 0 to + 1.45V *vs.* NHE with the potential scan rate of 50 mV.s-1 induced the deposition of a brown thin film

of W:CoO on a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) or a glassy carbon electrode. Alternatively, the deposition of W:CoO was achieved by holding a FTO or a carbon electrode at a constant potential of +1.2 V *vs.* NHE or higher. During the deposition, evolution of O<sup>2</sup> bubbles on the electrode surface was observed, indicating catalytic capability of the deposit.

**Figure 2**. Morphology analysis of a W:CoO thin film deposited on a FTO electrode. (**a**) SEM image on the surface; (**b**) SEM cross-section; (**c**) AFM image on the surface; and (**d**) Surface cross-section profile obtained when driving the tip on the red line shown in figure (**c**)

**Figure 2** shows the morphology of a W:CoO film obtained on FTO electrode at deposition potential of +1.2V *vs.* NHE. Scanning electron microscopic (SEM) analysis revealed a homogeneous morphology over the large surface area of the film (**figure 2a**). Cracks and holes are observed. Closer observation, conducted by atomic force microscopic (AFM) analysis in a small surface area of 20x20 m<sup>2</sup> , showed homogeneous surface with small holes having average size of 200-400 nm (**figure 2c**). AFM cross section depth profile revealed an average depth of ca. 75 nm with few exceptions where average depth of ca. 175 nm was observed (**figure 2d**). However, the hole depth value was significantly lower compared with the film thickness, being of ca. 760 nm, determined by the SEM cross-section analysis (**figure 2b**). Thus, it is clear that these holes are generated on the surface when the W:CoO deposit already displayed certain catalytic activity that caused the evolution of an important amount of O2bubbles. The available cracks and holes are positive features that help to increase the number of exposed active sites. As a result, these features contribute to the high activity of the W:CoO catalyst (*see the following section*). We noted that the morphology was not varied in a significant manner when the deposition potential was changed (**figure S1**).

**Figure 3**. XPS analysis on an as-prepared W:CoO catalyst (red dots data) and on a steady W:CoO(**s**) catalyst (blue dots data)

We then analyzed the chemical composition of the W:CoO film by using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). In XPS analysis, the Co2p3/2 was found at binding energy of 780.7 eV (**figure 3a**), being assignable to Co3+ species within cobalt oxide. Similar signature was found for the Co3+ species within a cobalt-oxidephosphate (CoPi),[9] a cobalt-tungsten-oxide (CoWO) or a cobaltiron-tungsten-oxide (CoWFeO).[5] The W4f envelop is well fitted for two species having 4f7/2 binding energy of 32.8 eV and 35.2 eV, respectively (**figure 3d**). These signals are assignable to the W4+ and W6+ within an oxide coordination environment. [3a, 10] It implies W could be incorporated within the cobalt oxide structure as a dopant or co-exist with in form of tungsten oxide, like the WO<sup>2</sup> and WO<sup>3</sup> species.[3a, 10] However, XRD analysis did not show any pattern of the tungsten oxide but the amorphous nature of the W:CoO. It was further supported by high resolution transmission electron microscopic analysis (**figure S2**). We noted that even after 3h of thermal annealing at 500C in air, the W:CoO remained amorphous without any observable tungsten oxide (**figure S3**). It is worth noting that under similar thermal treatment the CoFeWO readily crystallized generating a mixture of oxides Fe3O4, Co3O<sup>4</sup> and CoWO4. [3a] Therefore, we concluded the deposit was an amorphous W-doped cobalt oxide wherein W dopant, existing both in 4+ and 6+ oxidation states, occupied the position of Co3+ ion. EDX analysis revealed the chemical composition of Co1OxP1.05W0.16S0.19 (**figure S4**) suggesting the rich content of W dopant within the cobalt oxide structure.

Consisting with the EDX analysis result, XPS analysis confirmed the presence of the P and S elements. Two S species having S2p binding energy of 168.2 and 163.5 eV were found (**figure 3b**). The lower binding energy species is assignable to a sulfide incorporated within the Co:WO, likely by occuping the O2- position, while the higher binding energy species is attributed to a surface bound sulfate.[11] The P was found within the W:CoO as a surfacebound phosphate species rather than as a dopant. Indeed, P2p

doublet was found at binding energy of 133.4 eV (P2p3/2) and 132.5 eV (P2p1/2) (**figure 3c**). This result is similar to that determined for the phosphate species bound on the surface of a cobalt oxide. [12] The sulfate and phosphate surface-bound species may play important role in the catalytic O2-evolving cycle by acting as a proton relay.[13]

We then investigated the O2-elvoving catalytic activity of the W:CoO catalyst in a pH 13 NaOH solution, being free of any transition metal ions. To track the kinetic parameters, we first employed a W:CoO film grown on a glassy carbon disk. The catalyst was polarized from +1.2 to +1.60 V *vs.* RHE with a potential scan rate of 2 mV.s-1 while the carbon disk was rotated at 6000 rpm. The W:CoO catalyst operated with an onset overpotential of 250 mV and required an overpotential of 350 mV to generate a catalytic current density of 10 mA.cm-2 (**figure 4,**  black curve). This performance was further enhanced when the catalyst was conditioned under the O2-evolving conditions. The steady activity was achieved by either repeating about ten consecutive potential polarizations or holding the catalyst at a constant potential of +1.6 V *vs.* RHE for 2h (**figure S5**). The steady catalyst, denoted hereafter as W:CoO(**s**), showed an onset overpotential of 230 mV and required a small overpotential of 320 mV to generate 10 mA.cm-2 catalytic current. The Tafel slope value was determined to be 45 mV.decade-1 , indicating a fast O2-evolving kinetics. A control CoO catalyst, wherein W dopant was not introduced, showed significant lower catalytic activity (**figure S6**). It confirmed the critical role of W dopant in enhancing the catalytic operation of the CoO catalyst. We also noted that the performance achieved for the current W:CoO(**s**) catalyst is even better than that reported for the IrO<sup>2</sup> and RuO<sup>2</sup> nanoparticles catalysts[14] and comparable to that achieved for the best cobalt-based OER catalysts (**Table S1**).

**Figure 4**. Consecutive I-V curves recorded on a W:CoO catalyst electrode immersed in a pH 13 NaOH solution. Insert shows Tafel plots for the first I-V curve (black curve) and the 10th (steady, red curve). Potential scan rate of 2 mV.s-1 and disk rotating rate of 6000 rpm*.* 

It is worth noting that the robustness is a critical figure of merits for the evaluation of an OER catalyst with perspectives of an incorporation within a PEC device for long run application. In several cases, noble-metal-free catalysts suffer of the activity degradation due to the catalyst detachment from the electrode surface[15] or a drastic change in morphology or in chemical composition of the catalyst.[16] Only few cases were known when activity of an OER catalyst was progressively improved under the catalytic operation.[17] For example, the enhanced catalytic performance of a NiFe/NiFeP hydroxide/phosphate catalyst during the O2-evolving operation was attributed to a combination of improved surface wettability, enhanced charge transfer rate and higher electrochemical surface area.[17] Thus, we investigated how these changes impacted on the catalytic activity of the current W:CoO catalyst. XPS analysis conducted on the W:CoO(**s**) steady catalyst showed almost identical signature to that obtained for the W:CoO as-prepared catalyst (**figure 3**). Only a minor change was observed concerning the S element. The sulfide species, found at low binding energy of S2p, was diminished (**figure 3b**). Indeed, under the strong oxidative condition applied, an oxidation of sulfide S2 into sulfate SO<sup>4</sup> 2 species was likely. Remarkably, phosphate species remained (**figure 3c**), indicating its strong chemical bonding to the surface of the W:CoO catalyst. It means even the OHion substrate with high chemical activity could not exchange to the surface-bound phosphate species. The presence of the phosphate proton relay was likely critical to the superior catalytic activity recorded for the W:CoO(**s**) catalyst.

Kelvin probe analysis revealed a significant change in the surface potential of the catalyst after being conditioned in the O2-evolving conditions. The surface potential was measured to be +168.96 mV for the W:CoO as-prepared catalyst and -81.42 mV for the W:CoO(**s**) steady catalyst. We attributed this change to the deprotonation of the surface hydroxy –OH group of the W:CoO catalyst during the O2-evolution in the alkaline electrolyte. Indeed, a similar deprotonation was demonstrated for the case of a NiO(OH) catalyst.[18]

**Figure 5**. AFM analyses recorded on a W:CoO as-prepared catalyst film (**a,c**) and on a W:CoO(**s**) steady catalyst film (**b,d**).

When the catalyst reached its steady form, a slight change in morphology was observed. AFM analysis showed the presence of larger spaces between the catalyst domains on the steady W:CoO(**s**) catalyst (**figure 5**). The surface roughness was found to slightly increased from 46.37 nm for the W:CoO as-prepared catalyst to 49.27 nm for the W:CoO(**s**) steady catalyst. This change in morphology made the catalyst more hydrophilic. The

water contact angles were determined to be 81 for the W:CoO as-prepared catalyst and 57 for the W:CoO(**s**) steady catalyst (**figure 5,** insert). In line with this observation, the specific electrochemical surface area of the W:CoO(**s**) steady catalyst was twofold higher than that of the as-prepared one (**figure S7, table S2**). The increment of electrochemical surface area increases the actual number of the active sites while the increasing of surface wettability favors the transportation of the water molecule or OHions to these active sites. In other words, a combination of these changes together with the remaining of surface-bound phosphate proton relay resulted in the enhancement of catalytic activity as recorded.

To conclude, we have demonstrated that the solution of [Co(WS4)2] 2 in a neutral pH 7 phosphate buffer was a valuable source of precursor for depositing the tungsten-doped cobalt oxide (W:CoO) thin film. The resultant W:CoO was one of the best catalysts, made of cobalt-oxide-based materials, for the oxygen evolution reaction in an alkaline solution. The catalyst was not degraded but further improved during the catalytic operation. Changes in the surface morphology, surface wettability, surface potential and electrochemical surface area were identified to be reasons behind the activity enhancement.

Previously, we have reported on the growth of the CoWSx, an efficient HER catalyst, *via* an electrochemical reduction process employing the same [Co(WS4)2] 2- deposition bath.[19] The current work completes the research that aims to identify an appropriate single deposition bath from that both efficient HER and OER catalysts can be grown. Now, it is possible to use a single [Co(WS4)2] 2- deposition bath for growing both CoWS<sup>x</sup> HER and W:CoO OER catalysts.

### **Experimental Section**

#### **Generals**

All chemicals were used as received without any purification. Fluorinedoped tin oxide (FTO, resistance of 14 cm), purchased from Sigma Aldrich, was cleaned by subsequent sonication in acetone, ethanol and DI water prior to use.

Electrochemical measurement was conducted employing a BioLogic science instrument SP150 potentiostat. A conventional two compartments electrochemical cell with three electrodes configuration was used. The reference was an aqueous Ag/AgCl/1M KCl electrode purchased from CHI instruments while the counter electrode was a Pt plate. The working electrode was a FTO electrode (surface area of 1 cm<sup>2</sup> ), a glassy carbon disk (surface area of 0.071 cm<sup>2</sup> ), or these electrodes coated with W:CoO catalyst.

Potentials are quoted against the Normal Hydrogen Electrode (NHE) or the Reversible Hydrogen Electrode (RHE):

E (*vs.* NHE) = E (*vs.* Ag/AgCl) + 0.21 (V)

E (*vs.* RHE) = E (*vs*. Ag/AgCl) + 0.21 + pH x 0.059 (V)

The electrolyte employed was either a pH 7 phosphate buffer (KPi) or a pH 13 NaOH solution.

## **Preparation of [Co(WS4)]2- deposition bath**

To 30 mL KPi solution, 7.5 µmol Co(NO3)2.6H2O (2.2 mg) and 7.5 µmol (NH4)2[WS4] (2.6 mg) were added, resulting in generation of a yellow solution of [Co(WS4)2] 2- . The solution was sonicated for 10 minutes then filtrated to remove any precipitates before use.

#### **Electrodeposition of W:CoO thin film**

To grow the W:CoO thin film, a FTO electrode or a carbon disk was immersed in a solution of 0.5 mM [Co(WS4)2] 2 in KPi and held at constant potential of +1.20 V *vs.* NHE for 3000s. The total charge density passed through the working electrode was 3.2 C.cm-2 . During the deposition, solution was stirred with help of a magnetic stirrer. When the deposition was over, the resultant W:CoO film was carefully washed with DI water, then dried in air prior to use for catalytic assay, microscopic and spectroscopic characterization.

A control CoO film was prepared by the same electrodeposition process using a 0.5 mM Co(NO3)<sup>2</sup> solution in KPi instead of the [Co(WS4)2] 2 deposition bath.

#### **Material characterization**

The surface morphology and cross-section analysis of the W:CoO asprepared catalyst and the W:CoO(**s**) steady catalyst were characterized by employing FED-SEM (HITACHI S4800, voltage 5 kV). Topographic images and potential mapping images were collected using tapping mode and Kelvin Probe Force Microscope (KPFM) mode, respectively, on an Asylum Research MFP-3D AFM. All measurements were performed using conductive Ti/Ir coated cantilevers (ASYELEC-01-R2, Asylum Research) with a nominal spring constant of 2.8 N/m and a resonance frequency of 78 kHz.

Chemical composition was determined by using Energy Dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS). EDX analysis was performed using an excitation beam of 15 kV. Several surface locations on different samples prepared under identical conditions were recorded to deduce the chemical composition. XPS analysis was conducted using an ESCALAB 220i-XL X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) system equipped with a hemispherical analyzer. The background pressure in the analysis chamber was in the 10−10 Torr range. The analyzer was calibrated with gold, silver, and copper polycrystalline standard samples by setting the Au 4f7/2, Ag 3d5/2 and Cu 2p3/2 peaks at binding energies of 83.98±0.02, 368.26±0.02, and 932.67±0.02 eV. The survey and high-energy resolution scans were recorded with pass energies of 150 and 20 eV, respectively.

Powder X-ray diffraction pattern was collected at room temperature from 20 to 80° 2 with a step size of 0.03° using Bruker D8 Advance (XRD, Cu-K radiation) equipped with 1D Lynxeye detector.

Water contact angle was measured by using an AmScope FMA050 Microscope Digital Camera.

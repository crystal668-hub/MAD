This study investigates the coupling of mercury sulfide (HgS) and copper oxide (CuO) nanoparticles with metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as a support material for enhancing the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The integration of HgS and CuO into the MOF framework aims to leverage the unique electronic and structural properties of both the nanoparticles and the MOFs to improve catalytic performance. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), particularly ZIF-67, are investigated for their potential to catalyze water-splitting reactions due to their high porosity and large specific surface areas. The strategic incorporation of HgS and CuO into ZIF-67 significantly enhances its electrocatalytic properties, resulting in remarkable

performance metrics: a low overpotential of 246 mV at 10 mA/cm², a Tafel slope of 123 mV/dec, an expanded electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) of 23.56 cm², and a reduced charge transfer resistance of 34.86  $\Omega$ . This integration enhances porosity and increases active surface area, which is crucial for improved catalytic performance. This investigation introduces an innovative methodology for fabricating highly efficient electrocatalysts, positioning HgS/CuO/ZIF-67 as a promising candidate for oxygen evolution reactions in alkaline media. The findings highlight the potential of this novel nanocomposite in future clean energy applications, particularly in the realm of water-splitting technologies.

#### 1. Introduction

The increasing demands of the population have caused ongoing environmental degradation and an increase in the consumption of carbon-based fuels. As a result, immense efforts have been dedicated to developing multifunctional nano-sized electrocatalysts as promising technologies for sustainable energy conversion and storage. These high-performance tuneable electrode materials are widely employed in electrocatalytic water splitting reactions, such as cathodic hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) and anodic oxygen evolution reactions (OER).[1-5] A multistage four-electron transfer process is involved in the kinetically sluggish OER for evolving an O2 molecule because it requires high electrochemical overpotential, hampering the overall water-splitting reaction. [6,7] State-of-the-art noble metalbased electrocatalysts such as IrO<sub>2</sub> and RuO<sub>2</sub> for the OER are not favored because of their limited availability and high cost. [8,9] As a result, scientists are working to develop robust, highly active, and commercially viable transition-metal-based electrocatalysts such as, oxides, nitrides, sulfides, hydroxides, and phosphides, for effective oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions in alkaline and acidic media.  $^{[10-18]}$ 

In the past few years, Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) offer several advantages for catalytic applications. Their high surface areas provide numerous active sites, while their tunable metal centers and organic linkers allow for optimization of catalytic performance. Additionally, MOFs often exhibit hierarchical porosity, facilitating mass transport and electron transfer. The structural flexibility of MOFs enables them to adapt during catalytic processes, potentially exposing more active sites. These combined properties make MOFs promising candidates for a variety of catalytic reactions.[19-21] Among various MOFs, zeolitic imidazolate framework-67 (ZIF-67), a cobalt-based MOF with a sodalite topology, has shown particular promise for OER catalysis owing to its high cobalt content and excellent stability in alkaline media. ZIF-67 is composed of Co2+ ions coordinated by 2-methylimidazolate ligands, forming a three-dimensional network with large cavities and small apertures. It has a tetrahedral unit of MN<sub>4</sub>, where M=Co linked together by imidazole ligands. [22-24] ZIF-67 offers several advantages as a catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Its high cobalt content provides numerous active sites, while its stability in alkaline media ensures its suitability for OER conditions. ZIF-67 can be easily synthesized at room temperature with controlled morphology, and its welldefined porous structure facilitates mass transport and offers a high surface area. These combined properties make ZIF-67 a promising candidate for OER catalysis.[25]

While the incorporation of various materials into ZIF-67 has been explored, the potential of mercury sulfide (HgS) and copper oxide (CuO) in this context remains largely unexplored. Mercury sulfide, a semiconductor with a narrow bandgap, has

shown promise in photoelectrochemical applications.[26] Its incorporation into ZIF-67 could potentially enhance light absorption and charge separation, leading to improved catalytic performance. Copper oxide (CuO) is a promising electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) due to its excellent electrical conductivity, catalytic activity, abundance, low cost, and environmental friendliness. CuO nanostructures, including nanowires and nanoflakes, have demonstrated promising OER performance.[27] Combining CuO with other materials like graphene or metal oxides has further enhanced its catalytic activity. Additionally, doping CuO with elements such as iron or nickel has been shown to improve its OER performance. These studies highlight the potential of CuO-based materials for efficient OER catalysis. When sulfide- and oxide-based materials are integrated owing to their distinctive properties, the overall water splitting kinetics was enhanced.[28] Yang et. al. suggested that ZIF-67 (R48)/CuO constructed on copper foam acts as an efficient OER electrocatalyst with a low overpotential of 344 mV at a current density of 200 mA/cm2 and high stability.[29] Zhang et. al. with co-worker Du. et. al. successfully fabricated Ti@TiO2/ CdS/ZIF-67 which possess a low overpotential (0.41 V @ 10 mA/ cm<sup>2</sup> current density), small Tafel slope (42 mV/dec), enhanced charge transfer properties, porosity and high cyclic stability.[7] The synergistic combination of HgS, CuO, and ZIF-67 offers several potential benefits for enhanced oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance. CuO's conductive nature facilitates electron transport, while HgS and CuO can introduce additional catalytic sites at the interfaces. The presence of HgS and CuO may also improve the stability of the ZIF-67 structure. Moreover, the interaction between these components could lead to favorable electronic structural modifications, promoting OER catalysis.

This study aims to develop a novel electrocatalyst for enhanced oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance by incorporating HgS and CuO into dodecahedral ZIF-67. The research will involve synthesizing HgS/CuO/ZIF-67 composites through a controlled two-step process, characterizing their morphology and structure using advanced techniques such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), attenuated total reflectance Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR), ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and atomic force microscopy (AFM), confirm the successful integration of HgS and CuO nanoparticles into ZIF-67's dodecahedral structure, evaluating their electrochemical performance for OER, elucidating the underlying mechanism of enhanced activity, and optimizing the composition and synthesis parameters. The as-synthesized ternary electrocatalyst possesses a low overpotential (246 mV) at a current density of 10 mA/cm2 , a tiny Tafel slope value (123 mV/dec), a large electrochemically active surface area (23.56 cm<sup>2</sup> ) and a small charge transfer resistance (34.86 Ω). The electrocatalytic stability of the as-prepared sample was explored using a chronoamperometry test at an overpotential of 246 mV for 18 h with 10.12% current density loss. Thus, the synergistic interaction between the HgS, CuO and Co-based ZIF-67 precursors led to the formation of a highly desirable OER electrode material for alkaline media. These findings will contribute to the development of high-performance metal-organic framework-based electrocatalysts for energy conversion applications.

#### 2. Results and Discussion

#### 2.1. X-Ray Diffraction Analysis

Powder XRD analysis was performed for the HgS- and CuOincorporated dodecahedron-shaped ZIF-67 electrocatalyst at a scan step of 0.026 from  $5^{\circ}$  to  $90^{\circ}$ . The intense diffraction peaks of HgS in the Figure 1(a) at 26.45°, 31.29°, 43.79° and 51.85° correspond to the (101), (012), (110), and (021) planes, respectively and are well indexed to the hexagonal crystal structure of cinnabar (JCPDS card no. 01-080-2192).[34] The XRD pattern of the hydrothermally prepared CuO as depicted in Figure 1(b) showed major peaks at  $2\theta = 35.64^{\circ}$ ,  $38.85^{\circ}$  and 48.83° indexed to (111), (111) and (202) crystal planes of the monoclinic system (JCPDS card no. 01-072-0629).[35] The cobalt ZIF-67 showed more intense peaks at 7.50°, 10.47°, 12.89°, 18.19°, and 26.83° attributed to the (011), (002), (112), (222) and (134) planes, respectively as shown in Figure 1(c). [36,37] All the less intense peaks also matched with those in the respective databases with slight shifts observed. The as-synthesized HgS/ CuO nanocomposite consists of all the major peaks of the precursor HgS and CuO, as confirmed by Figure 1(d). The diffraction peaks of the as-synthesized nanocomposites HgS/ ZIF-67 and CuO/ZIF-67 in Figure 1(e and f) also match well with their respective precursor peaks. The diffraction peaks of the hybrid nanostructure HgS/CuO/ZIF-67 correspond well to the major peaks of HgS, CuO and ZIF-67, with no additional peaks confirming the highly crystalline structure, as depicted in Figure 1(g). The diffraction peaks of HgS at 26.45° and ZIF-67 at 26.83° overlap, resulting in an increase in the peak intensity in the HgS/ZIF-67 and HgS/CuO/ZIF-67 nanocomposites.

#### **2.2. Attenuated Total Reflectance – Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) Study**

The surface functional groups and bonding nature of the assynthesized materials were analyzed by ATR-FTIR spectroscopy in the range of 400–4000 cm <sup>1</sup> at room temperature. The pristine HgS showed peaks at 495.51, 513.92, 950.21, 1160.95, and 1517.59 cm <sup>1</sup> due to the Hg and S bonding interactions in Figure 2(a).[38] The ATR-FTIR peaks of CuO nanoparticles at 511.8 and 586.51 cm <sup>1</sup> suggest their formation and Cu O stretching vibrations. The peaks in Figure 2(b) between 511.8 and 1062.27 cm <sup>1</sup> are the characteristic peaks of CuO.[39] The peak at 430.75 cm <sup>1</sup> is attributed to the Co N bonding of pure ZIF-67 as shown in Figure 2(c). The ATR-FTIR peaks at 685.89 and 750.03 cm <sup>1</sup> are attributed to C H bending modes, while the peaks between 991.79 and 1431.6 cm <sup>1</sup> denote the C N

stretching vibrations.[33,40] The as-synthesized HgS/CuO shows peaks at 421.58, 504.05, 962.19 and 1136.28 cm <sup>1</sup> corresponding to the precursor peaks of HgS and CuO, as depicted in Figure 2(d). Figure 2(e) reveals the FTIR spectra of HgS/ZIF-67, which exhibited peaks at 420.41, 746.32, 1135.87 and 1425 cm <sup>1</sup> belonging to HgS and ZIF-67 counterparts, and the peaks at 421.67, 522.37, 586.54, 751.44, 687.3 and 1067.91 cm <sup>1</sup> are ascribed to CuO/ZIF-67 nanocomposite for CuO and ZIF-67 precursors, from Figure 2(f). Notably, the nanocomposite HgS/ CuO/ZIF-67 peaks at 419.44, 523.08, 672.5, 956.55, 1068.62, and 1148.26 cm <sup>1</sup> exhibit the characteristic peaks of all the three counterparts HgS, CuO and ZIF-67 with slight shifts, as depicted in Figure 2(g). The peak observed at nearly 2360.41 cm <sup>1</sup> is associated with CO2 asymmetric stretching vibrations, and the peak observed at 2976.44 cm <sup>1</sup> is ascribed to –OH asymmetric stretching vibrations due to adsorbed water molecules in all the synthesized materials.[41,42]

#### **2.3. UV-Vis Spectroscopy Analysis**

The UV-visible spectral data of the as-synthesized materials homogenously dispersed in ethanol solvent were recorded at room temperature as depicted in Figure 3. The pristine HgS showed a broad absorption peak at 436.5 nm,[34] while CuO nanoparticles showed an absorption edge at 634 nm.[32] The pristine Co-ZIF-67 exhibited a broad absorption band between 500–600 nm, signifying d-d transitions and another absorption edge at 259 nm attributed to metal-to-ligand charge transfer.[43,44] The binary composite HgS/CuO exhibited a hypsochromic shift with respect to the two precursors. The metal-organic framework ZIF-67 revealed a red shift when combined with HgS as well as CuO separately, with a decrease in the absorption coefficient. The ternary composite HgS/CuO/ ZIF-67 exhibits absorption edges at 284 nm and 358.5 nm, indicating a bathochromic shift upon the integration of HgS and CuO into ZIF-67. This integration results in a further decrease in the absorption coefficient. This bathochromic shift is indicative of alterations in the electronic structure of the composite materials, which are crucial for understanding their potential applications in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The bathochromic shift suggests that upon integration, the electronic transitions associated with the excited states of the composite occur at longer wavelengths, which can enhance the light absorption capabilities of the material. This is particularly important for photocatalytic processes, where the ability to absorb a broader spectrum of light can facilitate the generation of charge carriers that are necessary for the catalytic reactions involved in OER. Additionally, the decrease in the absorption coefficient associated with this integration signifies a change in the interaction between light and the material. A lower absorption coefficient may imply improved charge separation and mobility within the composite structure. This can enhance the efficiency of exciton generation and their subsequent involvement in OER, thereby increasing the overall catalytic activity. The integration of HgS and CuO into the ZIF-67 not only modifies the optical properties but can also influence the electronic and structural characteristics of the composite. Thus, the bathochromic shift and the altered absorption coefficient underscore the importance of the material's optical properties in its catalytic efficiency for OER, as they collectively contribute to the enhanced light absorption, charge dynamics, and overall reaction kinetics within the framework of the composite material.[45] Further exploration of these properties can elucidate the underlying mechanisms facilitating improved performance in OER applications.

### **2.4. Field Emission-Scanning Electron Microscopy and Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy Analysis (FE-SEM & EDX)**

The morphology of the as-prepared HgS/CuO/ZIF-67 was observed using Field emission-scanning electron microscopy, which confirmed the agglomeration of HgS and CuO nanoparticles over dodecahedral ZIF-67, as depicted in Figure 4(a–c). The elemental composition was confirmed by EDX spectroscopy and elemental mapping. The nanomaterial comprises the elements (Co, C, N, Cu, Hg, O, and S) of all the pristine pure compounds, i. e., HgS, CuO, and ZIF-67, as shown in Figure 4(c– k). The atomic percentages of the elements present in HgS/ CuO/ZIF-67 are C (51.46%), N (14.85%), O (12.21%), S (2.80%), Co (5.61%), Cu (9.01%), and Hg (4.06%), as depicted in Figure 4(l–m). The FESEM images, EDX spectral analysis, and elemental mapping of the as-synthesized HgS, ZIF-67, HgS/CuO, HgS/ZIF-67, and CuO/ZIF-67 are illustrated in Figures S1–S5, respectively. The FE-SEM image of the as-synthesized pristine HgS reveals the particle shape of the material with elemental composition as Hg and S, as depicted in Figure S1. Moreover, the ZIF-67 nanomaterial possesses a dodecahedral shape,[46] with Co, C and N present, as shown in Figure S2. Clusters of HgS and CuO nanoparticles are observed in the HgS/CuO image, as depicted in Figure S4, and agglomerations of HgS and CuO are witnessed over dodecahedrons of ZIF-67 in HgS/ ZIF-67 and CuO/ZIF-67 nanocomposites respectively. The EDX spectra and elemental mapping of the as-synthesized materials HgS/ZIF-67, and HgS/CuO are shown in Figures S3 and S5.

#### **2.5. Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) Analysis**

To investigate the surface topography of the as-synthesized HgS, ZIF-67, HgS/CuO, and HgS/CuO/ZIF-67 composite, atomic force microscopy (AFM) was employed using a Bruker Multimode 8 instrument in tapping mode. For AFM imaging, 1×1 cm<sup>2</sup> Silicon wafers were plasma cleaned with an Omicron Scientific Equipment Co. Plasma bonder for 10 min to render the surface hydrophilic. The wafers were then rinsed with a 1:1 mixture of ethanol and MQ water, further a diluted sample

solution was drop-cast on the wafer and allowed to dry under moist conditions.[47] Subsequently, the samples were prepared for further analysis. AFM imaging confirmed the formation of HgS/CuO/ZIF-67. The 2D and 3D images of HgS, ZIF-67, HgS/ CuO and HgS/CuO/ZIF-67 displayed in Figure 5(a–d) indicated a height of 30.4 nm, 14.1 nm, 547.4 nm, and 279.7 nm, with

lateral dimensions of 1.0 μm, 2.0 μm, 3.0 μm, and 5.0 μm, respectively.

#### **2.6. X-Ray Photoelectron Spectra (XPS) Analysis**

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic analysis was performed to investigate the chemical composition and valence state of the components present in the given material.[48] The XPS survey spectrum of the as-synthesized HgS/CuO/ZIF-67 composite showed the presence of Hg, Co, C, Cu, N, O and S elements, as depicted in Figure S6(a). The Hg 4f spectrum in Figure 6(a) showed two intense peaks at binding energies of 104.57 eV and 100.65 eV attributed to 4f5/2 and 4f7/2 spin-orbit doublets, respectively, for Hg2<sup>+</sup> ions. The deconvoluted peaks at 161.6 eV and 162.8 eV are ascribed to 2p3/2 and 2p1/2, respectively, for S2 ions (S 2p), as illustrated in Figure 6(b).[49] The XPS fitted peaks of the Co 2p element (Figure 6(c)) at 781.34 eV and 796.87 eV are attributed to Co2<sup>+</sup> ions, with corresponding shake-up satellites at 786.54 eV and 802.9 eV, respectively. Figure 6(d) gives the Cu 2p XPS spectra with 933.31 eV and 953.52 eV, which were further deconvulated into two satellite peaks for 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 orbitals of Cu<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> ions. Additionally, the C 1s and N 1s XPS fitted peaks suggest the presence of C N and C C bonds at 285.53 eV and 284.65 eV, respectively, and for N at 398.88 eV and 399.57 eV belonging to C N and C=N bonds, respectively (Figure 6(e and f)). The O 1s spectra deconvulated to 531.83 eV and 530.58 eV ascribed to oxygen vacancies and Cu O bonds, are shown in Figure S6(b). Furthermore, the XPS survey spectra and elemental spectra for HgS and HgS/ZIF-67 are depicted in Figure S7(a–f).[29,34]

### **2.7. Electrochemical Measurement**

All the electrochemical studies were conducted using a Metrohm Autolab instrument connected to a three-electrode system. The system included an Ag/AgCl reference electrode, a platinum counter electrode, and a glassy carbon (GC) working electrode coated with the electrocatalyst. The measurements were performed using Nova 2.1.4 software at room temperature.[50,51] The catalytic ink was prepared by dissolving 5 mg of material in a mixture of 150 μL of double-distilled water and 100 μL ethanol. The mixture was then sonicated for 10 min. Next, 15 μL of 5% Nafion solution was added to it. The resultant was again sonicated for 5 min and dropcasted on the working electrode and left overnight for drying.[52]

The electrochemical measurements were performed in a 1 M KOH solution (pH=13.8) for the Oxygen evolution reaction according to the following Nernst equation:

$$E(RHE) = E(Ag/AgCI) + 0.059 pH + E(Ref)$$

Linear sweep voltammetry measurements were performed in the potential window range of 0 V to 1 V at a scanning rate of 10 mVs 1 . The LSV results of the HgS/CuO/ZIF-67 nanocomposite showed the lowest overpotential of 246 mV to record the current density of 10 mA/cm2 compared with those of its counterparts CuO/ZIF-67, HgS/ZIF-67, HgS/CuO, ZIF-67, CuO and HgS, which had overpotentials of 311 mV, 361 mV, 412 mV, 434 mV, 473 mV, and 502 mV, respectively, and that of standard IrO2 (329 mV). The OER kinetics of HgS/CuO/ZIF-67 was studied using Tafel plot, whose slope was found to be 123 mV/dec, indicating better OER activity. The Tafel slopes of

its constituents CuO/ZIF-67, HgS/ZIF-67, HgS/CuO, ZIF-67, CuO, HgS and  $IrO_2$  were found to be 212 mV/dec, 288 mV/dec, 274 mV/dec, 320 mV/dec, 138 mV/dec, 439 mV/dec, and 82 mV/dec, respectively, as depicted in Figure 7(a and b).

The charge transfer resistances (R<sub>ct</sub>) of the electrocatalysts were investigated using Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (by Nyquist plot) and was found out to be the lowest for HgS/CuO/ZIF-67 (34.86  $\Omega$ ). The materials CuO/ZIF-67 (404.58  $\Omega$ ), HgS/ZIF-67 (503.87  $\Omega$ ), HgS/CuO (702.46  $\Omega$ ), ZIF-67 (800.27  $\Omega$ ), CuO (853.62  $\Omega$ ) and HgS (1410.85  $\Omega$ ) suggests slower OER kinetics in alkaline medium, as shown in Figure 7(c). Meanwhile, the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) and double layer capacitance (C<sub>cl</sub>) (53,54) of the samples were investigated using cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves at scan rates of 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 mV/s, as displayed in Figure S8. The ECSA value can be calculated from the C<sub>cl</sub> value using the following equation:

$$ECSA = CdI / Cs$$

where the specific capacitance ( $C_s$ ) value for the flat working electrode is 40  $\mu$ F cm<sup>-2</sup> per cm<sup>2</sup><sub>ECSA</sub>, and  $C_{cll}$  is calculated from the  $J_a$  and  $J_c$  versus scan rate plot. [55-57] The ECSAs exhibited by CuO/ZIF-67, HgS/ZIF-67, HgS/CuO, ZIF-67, CuO and HgS were 10.18 cm², 11.75 cm², 6.74 cm², 3.65 cm², 2.85 cm², and 0.91 cm² lower than that for HgS/CuO/ZIF-67 (23.56 cm²). The comparative study of the overpotential and Tafel slope is shown in Figure 7(d).

For further investigation, the mass activities of the respective samples were determined from the mass loading values, as follows:

Mass Activity 
$$(A/g) = \frac{j (A/cm2)}{m (g/cm2)}$$

206.04 A/g for HgS/CuO/ZIF-67 (the highest value), 68.91 A/g for CuO/ZIF-67, 66.82 A/g for HgS/ZIF-67, 52.82 A/g for HgS/CuO, 47.23 A/g for CuO, 44.23 A/g for ZIF-67, and 43.65 A/g for HgS from Figure 8(b). Chronoamperometric measurements were performed to analyze the electrocatalytic stability of the as-prepared sample HgS/CuO/ZIF-67 at an overpotential of 246 mV for 18 h with a current density loss of 10.12% (Figure 8(a)). After the chronoamperometric test, the XRD and FESEM images (Figure S9) of the HgS/CuO/ZIF-67 catalyst indicate that no structural deformation occurs during the OER performance (Table 1).

The above results demonstrate the excellent OER activity of the as-synthesized HgS/CuO/ZIF-67 nanocomposite due to the synergistic effect between the precursors HgS, CuO, and ZIF-67, which led to low overpotential value, small tafel slope, excellent porosity, large surface area, low charge transfer resistance, and good electrocatalytic stability.

# **Conclusions**

This study successfully synthesized a HgS/CuO/ZIF-67 composite electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The successful incorporation of HgS and CuO into the ZIF-67 framework has resulted in the formation of an interfacial structure, a highly efficient electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media. The HgS/CuO/ZIF-67 composite exhibited superior OER activity compared to pristine ZIF-67 and the individual HgS/ZIF-67 and CuO/ZIF-67 composites, with a lower overpotential of 246 mV at 10 mA/cm2 , a small Tafel slope of 123 mV/dec, a substantial electrochemical active surface area of 23.56 cm<sup>2</sup> . Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy revealed improved charge transfer properties in the HgS/CuO/ZIF-67 composite, attributed to the synergistic effects between the components and the unique interfacial structure having low charge transfer resistance of 34.86 Ω, and a high mass activity of 206.04 A/g. Additionally, the material demonstrated excellent catalytic durability, with only a 10.12% current density loss at the specified overpotential, and maintains a highly porous structure. The remarkable performance is attributed to the synergistic interaction between HgS, CuO, and the ZIF-67 framework, which enhances the electrocatalytic activity for water splitting. This study highlights the potential of HgS/CuO/ZIF-67 as a potential electrocatalyst for sustainable energy applications, particularly in water-splitting processes.

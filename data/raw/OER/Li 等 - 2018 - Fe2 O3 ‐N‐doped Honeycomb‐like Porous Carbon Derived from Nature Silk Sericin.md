# **1 Introduction**

Faced with the current environmental pollution and energy crisis,[1] renewable hydrogen has drawn more and more attention to replacing carbon-based fuels such as coal, natural gas, and petroleum over the past few decades.[2] Due to reducing the use of these limited resources and their impact on the environment, many researchers pursue to search alternative energy.[3] Numerous innovative ideas have been proposed for achieving more efficient energy conversion or storage systems such as alkaline water electrolysis, fuel cells, and metal-air batteries.[4] It is the most promising, clean and environmentally friendly to electrolyze water into hydrogen and oxygen by electrochemical methods.[5] Meanwhile, the cathode part involves hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) or oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the anode part proceeds with oxygen evolution reaction (OER) or oxidation of some chemical fuels.[4a,6] Hence it can be easily expected that OER requires a lower energy (lower overpotential) to overcome the kinetic barrier of the OER occurred.[7] In the past several decades, the electrocatalytic OER has been extensively studied and various catalysts have been designed to improve electrode kinetics and stability under different electrolyte environments.[8]

However, slow kinetics and high overpotential of OER become the limiting factor of electrocatalytic efficiency. Ru and its alloys are most efficient OER electrocatalysts,[9] but its expensive price and lack of resources, limiting its large-scale applications.[10] Therefore it is attractive to design eco-friendly, low overpotential and durable electrocatalysts for OER. In or-

\* Dr. J. Gao E-Mail: jkgao@zstu.edu.cn der to achieve the goal, recent researchers have increasingly focused on carbon materials composited with transition metal chalcogenides, metal oxide, including heteroatom-doped especially nitrogen-doping carbon or graphene-like materials.[11] Recently, Fe oxides nanoparticles have attracted widespread attention for the characteristics of low cost, easy preparation and good catalytic activity toward OER.[12] Compared with precious metal catalyst, it also can enhance the catalytic activity and decrease kinetics.[13]

So far, our common carbon materials are graphene or graphene-like carbon, natural biomass-derived carbon materials, carbon fibers, and nanotubes, etc.[14] Especially, natural biomassderived carbon as an electrode modified material gaining more and more attention.[15] Meanwhile, porous carbon materials are ideal electrode materials due to their large specific surface area, which can provide many active sites,[16] outstanding electrical conductivity and good durability. As we all know about biomass-derived carbon through pyrolysis, not only it can complete nitrogen doping successfully but also can form porous carbon, which could provide a mass of active sites for metal particles and increase the electron transfer and electrical conductivity.[17] Nowadays, plenty of works focused on metal particles doping carbon hybrid materials as OER catalyst.[18] Experimentally, *Wang* et al. reported pomelo skin-derived carbon and Co3+ species prepared composite materials for OER, showing excellent electrocatalytic performance, graphene has a good conductivity and more active sites, which were beneficial to catalytic activity and cobalt ions played an important role in good OER performance.[19]

In this study, the nitrogen-doped honeycomb-like porous Fe2O3-carbon hybrid materials (SS-Fe refer to silk sericin-Fe) were prepared by a simple pyrolysis method. We used natural silk sericin as a carrier and ferric nitrate as the metal ion precursor to achieve the Fe2O3 bonded with sericin carrier during the carbonization. They were characterized by TEM, SEM,

XRD, EA, and BET. The prepared SS-Fe-0.5 was used to modify the glassy carbon electrode (GCE) for OER electrochemical test in alkaline solution, The SS-Fe-0.5 exhibit an excellent electrocatalytic performance and long-term stability for OER, the overpotential is 440 mV vs. RHE at a current density of 10 mA**·**cm–2 and the Tafel slope is only 68 mV per decade. Furthermore, the high sensitivity, good conductivity, and stability of the proposed electrochemical materials were also studied in detail. This is an ideal catalyst that can be applied to relieve the energy crisis.

# **2 Experimental Section**

#### *2.1 Chemicals and General Methods*

Iron nitrate, 2-propanol, and KOH were bought from Aladin Ltd (Shanghai China). Nafion was bought from Sigma. All reagents were not otherwise processed and purified.

The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were recorded with a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer with a graphite-monochromatized Cu-*K*<sup>α</sup> radiation. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method was used to calculate the specific surface areas. The N2 adsorptiondesorption isotherms at 77 K were measured with a Micrometrics ASAP 2010 system to evaluate their pore structures. All the samples were degassed at 200 °C for 2 h before the surface area measurements. The morphologies of the sample were observed by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, Vltra55, Carl Zeiss) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-2100). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data were obtained with a Thermal Fisher Scientific K-Alpha electron spectrometer. Elemental analyses were obtained with a ThermoFinnigan Instruments Flash EA1112 micro- elemental analyzer.

### *2.2 Synthesis of SS-Fe Materials*

Sericin (5 g) was added into deionized water 50 mL and stirred for 1 h. Iron nitrate (1.5 g) was added into the dissolved sericin solution. The ratio of iron nitrate quality to sericin is 0.3. A mixture of sericin and iron ions was obtained. The samples were freeze-dried at –60 °C for 48 h and a yellow powder was obtained.

The yellow powder was put into a tube furnace and heated to 800 °C (ramp rate: 2 K**·**min–1) and maintained for 2 h in an argon airflow. The heated samples became a fine black powder. The final samples were named as SS-Fe-0.3 (0.3 refers to iron nitrate:sericin = 0.3).

SS-Fe-0.5, SS-Fe-0.7, and SS-Fe-1.0 were also synthesized via a similar procedure for comparison. The pure sericin was donated as SS in the article.

Elemental analysis for SS-Fe-0.5: found C, 45.86; N, 0.87; H, 0.42 %; SS-Fe-0.3: C 61.75; N 1.46; H 0.684 %; SS-Fe-0.7: C 25.35, N 0.63, H 0.66 %, SS-Fe-1.0: C 12.48; N 0.23; H 0.123 %.

#### *2.3 Electrochemical Measurements*

The bare GCE was ultrasonically processed with ethanol and distilled water for 20 min to reduce the surface residue, respectively, and polished with 0.3 and 0.05 mm of alumina slurry carefully, followed by washing in ethanol and doubly distilled water, and finally drying. The SS-Fe powder (5 mg) was dispersed in 1 mL of mixture solvent, composed of 3:1 (v/v) 2-propanol/distilled water and 30 μL of nafion solution (5 wt %) by ultrasonication to form a homogeneous ink. Additionally, 5 μL of ink was carefully transferred onto the GCE with a diameter of 3 mm and dried at room temperature.

Electrochemical measurements were performed with a Zahner Zennium electrochemical workstation using a typical three-electrode setup with an electrolyte solution of 1.0 m KOH aqueous solution. A carbon electrode as the counter electrode, an Ag/AgCl electrode (saturated KCl) as the reference electrode, and a modified glassy carbon electrode (geometric area: 0.0706 cm2 ) as the working electrode.

Next, cyclic voltammetry (CV) was used to active the sample and remove impurities from the electrode surface, followed by scanning at the rate of 500 mV**·**s–1 for 2000 cycles. The OER activities of the catalysts were evaluated using linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) at a scan rate of 5 mV**·**s–1. All potentials measured were calibrated a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) based on the formula: *E*RHE = *E*Ag/AgCl + 0.197 + 0.0591 pH.

# **3 Results and Discussion**

In the present investigation, the iron nitrate was mixed with a sericin solution and then freeze-dried. After graphitization at 800 °C for 2 h with a heating rate of 2 K**·**min–1 in a tube furnace in an argon atmosphere, small Fe2O3 particles formed across the sericin-derived surfaces. Figure 1a–f shows the SEM micrograph of pure sericin and different ratio mixtures. As shown in Figure 1a, the surface of SS is smooth and the original pure SS samples show a curved two-dimensional (2D) carbon layer. The honeycomb three-dimensional (3D) porous structure formed after adding ferric nitrate though carbonization in Figure 1b–1f.

**Figure 1.** SEM image of (a) SS, (b) SS-Fe-0.3, (c) and (d) SS-Fe-0.5, (e) SS-Fe-0.7, and (f) SS-Fe-1.0 samples.

Consistent with the BET results, the micropores and mesopores appeared in the other samples, which can enhance the electron transfer ability, the conductivity of the samples, and is beneficial to the process of Fe2O3 particles loading. The mixtures have a huge surface area, which can provide more particles attachment sites. With different ratios of iron nitrate and sericin, the mixture shows different particle size and pore uniformity. When the ratio of iron nitrate and sericin is 0.3, the obtained SS-Fe-0.3 shows 3D porous non-uniform structure and the Fe2O3 particles distributed on the surface with small size compared to SS-Fe-0.7 and SS-Fe-1.0 (Figure 1b). It indicated that the less iron nitrate would form uniform and small loading particles in the carrier. As the ratio of iron nitrate and sericin is increased (0.7 and 1.0), the mixture also shows rich 3D porous carbon but uniform and the loading Fe2O3 particle distribution is non-uniform and the size is large (Figure 1e–f). It indicated that the more iron nitrate would form non-uniform and huge loading particles in the carrier. When the ratio of iron nitrate and sericin is 0.5, the mixture shows uniform 3D honeycomb-like porous carbon (Figure 1c) and the loading Fe2O3 particle distribution is uniform (Figure 1d) which can enhance the electron transfer ability, the conductivity of the samples, and more active sites to obtain better OER electrocatalytic activity.

The TEM in Figure 2a further highlights the rich pore structure and shows graphite-like carbon layer. The loading Fe2O3 particle distributed uniform and the size of it is around 50 nm. The high-resolution TEM micrograph highlights that each layer structure is a thin nano-sheet bonded layer structure after high-temperature calcination and the ferric oxide particles are adhered to the carbon layer successfully (Figure 2b). Figure 2b shows that the lattice fringes of the Fe2O3 particle are 2.4 and 1.9 Å, which corresponds to the (240) and (611) planes of the Fe2O3 particle, respectively. As we all know, the porous structure not only can speed up electron transfer process but also would provide more particles attachment sites. Meanwhile,

small ferric oxide partials would provide a large number of active sites to improve the OER performance.

Further, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed to analyze the chemical composition of SS-Fe-0.5, as shown in Figure 3. The surface survey XPS spectra show the presence of C (88.5 %), N (2.5%), O (8.24%), and Fe (0.76 %) in SS-Fe-0.5. The high-resolution C 1s spectrum (Figure 3b) could be divided into three peaks at around 284.7, 285.8. and 286.2 eV, assigned to C–C, C–N, and C–O. The high-resolution N 1s spectra could be separated into four peaks at 398.6, 399.97, 401.2, and 402.04 eV, respectively. The above result fully demonstrates the doping of nitrogen in the catalyst. The Fe 2p spectrum could be deconvoluted into three peaks, and the binding energies at around 711 and 725.3 eV assigned to the binding energies of the 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 bands of Fe3+, respectively. And there is a satellite peak at 713.07 eV.

The specific surface areas (SSA) of all samples were determined by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method. The isotherm of all samples shows an obvious hysteresis loop after the addition of ferric nitrate (see Figure 4), indicating that the micropores and mesopores structure of SS-Fe. Consistent with the SEM results, it was found that the specific surface area is only 83 m<sup>2</sup> **·**g–1 when the ratio of ferric nitrate and sericin is 0.3 and 0.7. However, with the ratio of 0.5, the specific surface areas increase up to 143 m<sup>2</sup> **·**g–1, then continues to increase the content of ferric nitrate, the specific surface areas of SS-Fe-1.0 is decreased to 77 m<sup>2</sup> **·**g–1. This result can be due to the addition of ferric nitrate and Fe2O3 particles affect the pore structure and specific surface area of the sample.

XRD patterns of SS-Fe-0.3, SS-Fe-0.5, SS-Fe-0.7, and SS-Fe-1.0 are shown in Figure 5: it can be clearly seen that all samples have two diffraction peaks located at 37.8° and 45.3°,

which correspond to the (240) and (611) planes of ferric oxide nanoparticles. XRD results are consistent with PDF#16–0653, which indicated the main ingredient of samples is Fe2O3.

We further studied the effect of the mass ratio of Fe and SS on the OER activity. As shown in Figure 6a, the SS-Fe-0.5 catalyst reveals the optimal activity for the OER compared to the four other samples. At a cathodic current density of 10 mA**·**cm–2, the overpotential of the SS-Fe-0.5 catalyst is only 440 mV and the overpotential of SS-Fe-0.3 is 462 mV. Meanwhile, as shown in Figure 6b, the Tafel slope of the SS-Fe-0.5 catalyst is 68 mV**·**dec–1, lower than those of the SS-Fe-0.3 (82 mV) and the SS-Fe-0.7 (135 mV**·**dec-1) catalysts. The smaller Tafel slope value indicates the superior OER activity.

The SS-Fe-0.5 catalyst electrode is very stable after 1000 circles CV (Figure 6c), which indicated their superior stability. Moreover, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was carried out at a bias of 600 mV to characterize the resistance and charge transfer of the catalyst and the diameter of the semicircle represents the impedance of charge transfer. Figure 6d shows EIS spectra of the SS-Fe-0.3, SS-Fe-0.5, and SS-Fe-1.0 in 1 m KOH solution, although SS-Fe-0.3 has a smaller semicircle but is incomplete, SS-Fe-0.5 shows good conductivity, further confirming the superior OER performance. Compared with pure SS, the SS-Fe-0.3, SS-Fe-0.5, and SS-Fe-0.7 catalysts have better OER activity, because the iron nitrate can etch the surface of SS and lead to the evolution of the porous morphology and structure. Moreover, consistent with BET results, the SS-Fe-0.5 catalyst has the most abundant pore structure and huge surface area, which enhanced OER activity. Finally, the SS-Fe-0.5 catalyst possesses a much smaller particle size than the other catalysts, it can increase the density of active sites, which accelerate electron transport and facilitate the contact with the electrolyte. Those factors all indicate that it is an ideal catalyst.

# **4 Conclusions**

In this work, we synthesized a series of SS-Fe carbon catalysts through pyrolysis using nature sericin as the nitrogen source and carbon source by intercalation of iron nitrate. The SS-Fe-0.5 exhibited a perfect honeycomb porous three-dimensional structure with a high SSA (143 m<sup>2</sup> **·**g–1), abundant macropore/mesoporous and iron ferric oxide doping that was small and uniform particles. The obtained SS-Fe-0.5 shows excellent OER performance in the alkaline electrolyte with an overpotential of 440 mV at 10 mA**·**cm–2, a small Tafel slope about 68 mV**·**dec–1 and long-term stability after 1000 CV cycles. This work presents a novel method for preparing porous carbon materials and demonstrates that SS-Fe carbon is an ideal catalyst for OER.

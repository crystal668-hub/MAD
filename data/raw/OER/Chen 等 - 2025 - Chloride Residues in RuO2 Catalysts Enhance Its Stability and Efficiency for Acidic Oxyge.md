Abstract: Ruthenium dioxide (RuO<sub>2</sub>) is a benchmark electrocatalyst for proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWE), but its stability during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is often compromised by lattice oxygen involvement and metal dissolution. Despite that the typical synthesis of RuO<sub>2</sub> produces chloride residues, the underlying function of chloride have not well investigated. In this study, we synthesized chlorine-containing RuO2 (RuO2-Cl) and pure RuO2 catalysts with similar morphology and crystallinity. RuO<sub>2</sub>-Cl demonstrated superior stability, three times greater than that of pure RuO2, and a lower overpotential of 176 mV at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. Furthermore, the RuO2-Cl catalysts that were in situ synthesized on a platinum-coated titanium felt could maintain high performance for up to 1200 hours at 100 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. Computational and experimental analyses show that chloride stabilizes RuO<sub>2</sub> by substituting the bridging oxygen atoms, which subsequently inhibits lattice oxygen evolution and Ru demetallation. Notably, this substitution also lowers the energy barrier of the rate-determining step by strengthening the binding of \*OOH intermediates. These findings offer new insights into the previously unknown role of chloride residues and how to improve RuO<sub>2</sub> stability.

#### 1. Introduction

The proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWE) is recognized as one of the most promising technologies for producing ultra-pure hydrogen, owing to its high current density, rapid response, compact design, and small carbon footprint.<sup>[1]</sup> However, the instability of catalysts for the acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and high oxidative overpotentials remain as the critical barriers to the widespread adoption of PEMWE systems.<sup>[2]</sup> Currently, IrO<sub>2</sub> catalysts are widely used in the commercial PEMWE due to their relatively stable performance.<sup>[3]</sup> Nonetheless, their low activity necessitates a high loading of the catalyst on the anode, significantly driving up the overall cost of the system. [4] In contrast, ruthenium dioxide (RuO2) offers notable advantages, such as lower cost and higher intrinsic activity, making it a promising alternative to IrO<sub>2</sub>, provided that its stability issues can be resolved. [5] Encouragingly, recent comprehensive studies have elucidated the dissolution mechanism of RuO2 under acidic OER conditions. The high covalency of the Ru-O bond results in significant overlap between the Ru 3d and O 2p orbitals, which activates the lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism (LOM).<sup>[6]</sup> This process leads to the generation of surface oxygen vacancies that propagate into the bulk structure, facilitating the formation of soluble RuO<sub>4</sub> species and the subsequent loss of active Ru, ultimately causing the collapse of the catalyst's structure.[7]

Inspired by the above mechanistic insights, significant efforts have recently been directed towards improving RuO<sub>2</sub> catalysts, primarily through the substitution of Ru sites with foreign metals.<sup>[8]</sup> This strategy has involved the incorporation of various metals, including alkali metals (e.g., Na),[9] transition metals (e.g., Zn,  $^{[10]}Mn$ ,  $^{[11]}Co$ ,  $^{[12]}Cr$ ,  $^{[13]}Cu$ ,  $^{[14]}$ ), pblock metals (e.g., Sn, [15] Al[16]), and rare earth metals (e.g., Tm, Er, Eu), resulting in diverse RuMO<sub>x</sub> (M represents the foreign metal) compositions. The introduction of these foreign metals modulates the covalency of Ru-O bonds, enhancing its intrinsic activity through increased covalency. However, this modification also activates the LOM, which compromises catalyst stability. Recent studies have highlighted the critical role of the foreign metal's electronegativity in modulating Ru-O bond covalency.[18] Achieving an optimal balance in covalency is essential to ensure that the OER proceeds via the adsorption evolution mechanism (AEM). This approach seeks to modestly enhance activity while maintaining stability. However, foreign metals remain susceptible to accelerated corrosion

under low pH and high oxidative potentials,[19] leading to the formation of metal vacancies that activate adjacent oxygen atoms and trigger the LOM pathway.[20] Furthermore, substituting Ru sites with foreign metals decreases the number of active Ru O catalytic centers, which hampers further improvements in catalyst activity.[21] Thus, there is a pressing need for innovative strategies that preserve the quantity of Ru O catalytic centers while simultaneously reducing Ru O bond covalency. Until now, achieving this delicate balance remains a significant challenge.

On the other hand, RuCl3 and its hydrates are widely utilized as the precursor for synthesizing RuO2-based catalysts.[22] However, most preparation methods do not intentionally remove chloride ions from the precursor before air calcination,[23] resulting in unavoidable residual chlorine in the final Ru-based catalysts. The potential poisoning effects of chloride ions in heterogeneous catalysis have been extensively studied across various reactions.[24] Consequently, chloride ions are frequently assumed to impair catalytic performance in OER process, leading to an underestimation of the impact of a small amount of chloride. Recent studies reveal that, in alkaline seawater electrolysis, abundant chloride ions can dynamically or statically adsorb onto the catalyst's active sites, facilitating both the activity and the stability to some extent.[25] Regrettably, the effect of chloride ions on acidic OER electrocatalysts remains underexplored. Considering the inevitable presence of chloride residue in RuO2-based catalysts and the enigmatic role of chloride in reaction mechanisms and catalyst structures, investigating the specific mechanisms and impacts of chloride residues on OER activity and catalyst active sites is therefore both urgent and critical.

Herein, we synthesized chlorine-containing RuO2 catalysts alongside pure RuO2 catalysts which have comparable morphology and crystallinity. Remarkably, the RuO2-Cl catalysts demonstrated significantly enhanced stability and activity compared to RuO2, with its stability being three times greater. The overpotential at a current density of 10 mAcm <sup>2</sup> for RuO2-Cl was 176 mV, which is 41 mV lower than that of RuO2. Additionally, RuO2-Cl that was in situ grown on a platinum-coated titanium felt collector, forming RuO2-Cl/PtTi, exhibited outstanding stability, maintaining high performance for up to 1200 h under 100 mAcm <sup>2</sup> . Its catalytic activity was also markedly improved relative to the powder catalysts. In situ experiments, supported by computational analyses, suggest that chloride ions preferentially form a stable structure by doubly substituting the bridging oxygen atoms, and their incorporation suppresses the LOM pathway, inhibiting lattice oxygen participation and increasing the demetallation energy of Ru. In the AEM pathway, Cl incorporation enhances the binding of the OOH intermediate, thereby lowering the reaction's limiting potential and ultimately improving the electrocatalytic performance.

## *2.1 Synthesis and characterization of RuO2-Cl catalysts*

The RuO2-Cl was synthesized by direct air calcination of ruthenium chloride hydrate at an optimized condition of 400 °C for 1 h. Guided by the thermogravimetry (TG) analysis of the precursor (Figure S1), the air calcination condition was explored to determine the optimal RuO2-Cl catalysts (Figure S2). For comparative analysis, RuO2 without residual chlorine was prepared by air calcination at 310 °C for 1 h from an amorphous Rux(OH)y precursor (Figure S3), which was obtained by adjusting the pH of a RuCl3 hydrate solution to alkaline conditions, thereby removing chloride ions into the solution and forming Rux- (OH)y precipitates. The Ru/Cl molar ratio of the catalysts, as measured by inductively coupled plasma analysis (for Ru element) and ion chromatography (for Cl element), was 0.96/0.04 and 1.00/0.00 for RuO2-Cl and RuO2 (Table S1), respectively, consistent with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) results (Figure S4). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements revealed that both RuO2-Cl and RuO2 were formed by the accumulation of irregularly shaped grains (Figure S5), indicating that there was no significant difference in their morphology. High-resolution TEM (HRTEM) of the RuO2 shows distinct lattice spacings of 0.256 nm and 0.318 nm, which can be ascribed to the (101) and (110) planes of rutile RuO2, respectively (Figures S6a,b).[26] By comparison, RuO2-Cl exhibits distinct lattice fringes with a spacing of 0.263 nm towards (101) planes (Figures 1a,b, Figures S6c,d), larger than the spacing observed in RuO2. The enlarged lattice spacing implies a slight expansion of the RuO2 lattice, which could be induced by the Cl modification. The HRTEM image after background noise filtering and the corresponding Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) pattern reveal the tetragonal crystalline structure from the [010] axis, in which the (200) and (101) planes with an angle of 55° can be discerned and Ru atoms are densely packed with a coordination number of 6 (Figures 1c-e).[27] The scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) bright-field images and corresponding EDS mappings show that Ru, O, and Cl elements are uniformly distributed in RuO2-Cl (Figures 1f), while in RuO2, only Ru and O elements are evenly distributed (Figure S7). Raman measurements are carried out to further confirm the presence of chlorine in the structure of RuO2-Cl (Figure 1g). In addition to exhibiting the typical Eg, A1g, and B2g modes of the Ru O bond,[28] RuO2-Cl also shows a distinct Bg mode associated with the Ru Cl bond.[29] In contrast, RuO2 only displays the modes of the Ru O bond. This strongly proves the presence of Ru Cl bonds in the structure of RuO2-Cl. Besides morphology, crystallinity is also a crucial factor influencing its activity. Therefore, the crystallinity of the catalyst was investigated using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). By comparing the exothermic enthalpy changes associated with further crystallization of the catalyst between 400 and 550 °C, it can be observed that crystallinity factors (αc) of RuO2-Cl and RuO2 are 0.65 and 0.62,[30] respectively (Figure 1h). Similar α<sup>c</sup> values for the two catalysts indicate their comparable crystallinity. As a step further, crystallite sizes are extracted according to the Scherrer equation from the most intensive diffraction peak of (101) plane in the XRD pattern (Figure 1i). The pattern of RuO2 displayed intensive peaks at 28.0°, 35.0°, and 54.2°,

corresponding well to the (110), (101), and (211) planes of the rutile phase with the space group (P42/mnm),[31] respectively. These peaks are similar to those observed in RuO2-Cl, confirming the formation of the same crystalline structure. The similar crystallite size of RuO2-Cl (13.2 nm) and RuO2 (12.6 nm) corroborates well with the results from DSC.[32] Moreover, the enlarged XRD pattern shows that the (110) and (101) peaks of RuO2-Cl shift to lower diffraction angles compared to those of pure RuO2 (Figure S8). This shift further confirms the lattice expansion,[33] which is likely due to the incorporation of Cl into the lattice. The electronic properties and valence states of the RuO2-Cl electrocatalyst were characterized using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). In the high-resolution Cl 2p XPS spectra (Figure S9), no Cl signal was observed in pure RuO2, whereas distinct peaks were evident in RuO2-Cl. Unlike RuCl3, which exhibits three different states of Cl, RuO2-Cl showed only two peaks at 197.4 eV and 198.8 eV, indicating the presence of Cl in two distinct environments.[34] In the Ru 3p XPS spectra (Figure S5), a slight positive shift of 0.3 eV in the binding energy of Ru was observed in RuO2-Cl compared to pure RuO2, and a negative shift of 0.8 eV relative to RuCl3. This suggests that the valence state of Ru in RuO2-Cl is between +3 and +4, slightly lower than +4.[35] In the O 1s XPS spectra, the lattice oxygen peak in RuO2-Cl exhibited a positive shift of 0.19 eV compared to the original RuO2, indicating electron transfer from O to Ru.[36] The positive shift in the O 1s binding energy, along with the shift in Ru 3p binding energy, provides direct evidence of the weakened covalency of the Ru O bond in RuO2-Cl. Furthermore, the structures of Cl residues in RuO2-Cl catalysts were detailed explored. Here, time-offlight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) was employed to perform depth profiling of the RuO2-Cl sample. Figure S10a shows the 3D depth profile of the RuO2-Cl, directly visualizing the spatial distribution of individual elements, which reveals a homogeneous distribution of Ru, O, and Cl. The depth profile in Figure S10b further confirms that the signal intensities of O and Cl are comparable and significantly higher than that of Ru. Moreover, as sputtering progresses, the elemental signal intensities remain stable. This evidence demonstrates the uniform distribution of all three elements on the catalyst surface. Figure S11a shows the Ru K-edge XANES spectra for RuO2-Cl and RuO2. The absorption edge of RuO2-Cl is slightly shifted to lower energy compared to RuO2, indicating a lower oxidation state of the Ru species in RuO2-Cl. This result is consistent with the Bader charge analysis (see details in DFT calculations). Additionally, the corresponding Fourier transform EXAFS (FT-EXAFS) spectrum of RuO2-Cl displays a prominent peak at ~1.99 Å, attributed to the Ru Cl scattering feature. A peak at ~1.46 Å, characteristic of Ru O scattering, is observed, with a 0.5 Å difference from the Ru Cl bond (Figure S11b). It is worth noting that the peak positions in R space do not correspond to the true bond lengths and are typically shifted by 0.3–0.4 Å. DFT calculations reveal that in the most stable configuration of RuO2-Cl, the Ru Cl bond length is 2.4 Å, and the Ru O bond length is 1.9 Å (Figure S12), with a difference of 0.5 Å, which is in good agreement with the experimental results.

#### *2.2 The evaluation of OER performance*

The OER activity of RuO2-Cl and comparative samples, including RuO2 and commercial RuO2, was evaluated using a three-electrode system in 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte. The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves in Figure 2a show that RuO2-Cl achieves a current density of 10 mAcm <sup>2</sup> at an overpotential (η10) of only 176 mV, significantly lower than that of RuO2 (217 mV) and commercial RuO2 (238 mV). Furthermore, the Tafel slope for RuO2-Cl is just 47.5 mV/ dec (Figure 2b), which is approximately 60% of the value for RuO2 (76.9 mV/dec) and half that of commercial RuO2 (101.2 mV/dec). This finding underscores the markedly superior electrocatalytic kinetics of RuO2-Cl compared to both of self-prepared RuO2 and commercial RuO2. Furthermore, the mass activity, normalized by the Ru content in the catalyst (Figure 2c), reveals that RuO2-Cl exhibits a mass activity of 116.2 A/gRu at 1.48 V, which is 3.2 times higher than that of RuO2 (35.8 A/gRu) and 4.7 times greater than commercial RuO2 (24.6 A/gRu). The high mass activity of RuO2-Cl demonstrates its superior activity per unit mass of Ru, which is crucial for reducing the loading of precious metals and advancing the practical application of the catalyst. To assess the intrinsic activity of RuO2-Cl, the roughness factor of the catalyst was determined using cyclic voltammetry in the non-Faradaic region (Figure S13, Figures 2d), allowing for the calculation of the electrochemical surface area (ECSA) (Figure S13e).[37] The results indicate that RuO2-Cl has a slightly higher Rf compared to self-made RuO2 and commercial RuO2, suggesting that the presence of Cl increases the density of active sites to some extent. After normalizing by ECSA, RuO2-Cl still exhibits higher electrocatalytic activity than both RuO2 catalysts (Figure 2e). Additionally, turnover frequency (TOF) was analyzed to examine the intrinsic activity at individual active sites, with results showing that the introduction of Cl significantly enhances TOF (Figure 2f).

At 1.45 V, the TOF of RuO2-Cl (67.3 h <sup>1</sup> ) is 3.4 times and 5.4 times higher than that of self-made RuO2 (19.5 h <sup>1</sup> ) and commercial RuO2 (12.5 h <sup>1</sup> ), respectively. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) results reveal that the charge transfer resistance (*R*ct) of RuO2-Cl is slightly lower than that of pure self-made RuO2 and commercial RuO2 (Figure 2g). As another important metric for performance evaluation, the OER durability of the RuO2-Cl catalyst was investigated using chronopotentiometry at 10 mAcm <sup>2</sup> (Figure 2h). Remarkably, RuO2-Cl exhibited a negligible increase in overpotential after 15 hours of continuous operation, whereas RuO2 and commercial RuO2 showed a significant increase in overpotential after less than 4 h under the same conditions. This suggests that the presence of Cl facilitates the structural stability of RuO2 under acidic OER conditions. To elucidate the intrinsic factors contributing to the stability of the RuO2-Cl catalyst, we employed TEM and XPS to characterize the morphology and electronic states of the catalyst after stability testing (Figures S14–16), comparing these results with the pre-test catalyst. TEM analysis revealed that RuO2-Cl retained its original microstructure even after prolonged operation, with the HRTEM images showing no reduction in the interplanar spacing of the (101) facets, indicating a stable lattice structure. EDS mapping demonstrated that Ru, Cl, and O elements were uniformly distributed across the catalyst, with no significant aggregation or segregation observed. The XPS analysis of the postcatalysis RuO2-Cl catalyst showed no significant shifts in binding energy compared to the pristine catalyst, suggesting that the electronic structure remained stable throughout the reaction process. These findings indicate that RuO2-Cl undergoes minimal surface reconstruction or dissolution during the operation, and its stable crystal and electronic structures are key to its exceptional durability during the reaction. Furthermore, the performances of RuO2-Cl catalysts in PEMWE were measured to evaluate its potential for industrial applications. RuO2-Cl demonstrates superior activity and stability compared to RuO2 (Figure S17). At a voltage of 1.54 V, RuO2-Cl achieves a current density of 1 Acm <sup>2</sup> . In stability tests, RuO2-Cl maintains a stable cell voltage for over 500 hours, indicating its promising potential for PEMWE applications.

Notably, the above powdered electrocatalysts necessitate the use of binders for attachment to electrode substrates, leading to diminished performance and instability at high current densities. Self-supporting electrodes eliminate the need for binders, maximizing active site exposure and

conductivity, and enhancing catalytic stability through the direct catalyst growth on conductive substrates.[38] To leverage these advantages, a ruthenium trichloride hydrate precursor was dissolved in ethanol and directly deposited onto a platinum-coated titanium felt (PtTi) current collector via drop-casting, followed by air calcination to produce the RuO2-Cl/PtTi three-dimensional self-supporting electrode (denoted as I-RC/PtTi) (Figure S18–21).[39] For comparison, a powdered catalyst was prepared and loaded onto PtTi using a binder (denoted as B-RC/PtTi), with the Ru loading matched to that of the I-RC/PtTi catalyst.

The OER activity of these catalysts was first evaluated in 0.5 M H2SO4. LSV curves revealed that the I-RC/PtTi exhibited an overpotential of 243 mV at a current density of 100 mAcm <sup>2</sup> , which was 45 mV lower than that of the B-RC/PtTi (Figure 3a). This finding indicates that the absence of a binder allows the RuO2-Cl to maintain high catalytic activity. Further analysis of Tafel slopes demonstrated that the I-RC/PtTi had a lower Tafel slope, signifying faster reaction kinetics (Figure 3b). Additionally, mass activity and turnover frequency (TOF) results also underscored the superior performance of the I-RC/PtTi (Figure 3c,d), highlighting the advantages of constructing self-supporting electrodes via in situ growth. Stability is another crucial parameter, particularly in acidic media where the strong corrosiveness of the electrolyte and the high oxidative potential pose challenges for maintaining long-term catalyst

stability, especially at high current densities. Stability evaluations were conducted by applying a high

current density to the catalysts using chronopotentiometry. The I-RC/PtTi exhibited significantly greater stability than the B-RC/PtTi, operating continuously at 100 mAcm <sup>2</sup> for over 1200 hours without an obvious increase in overpotential (Figure 3e). LSV curves before and after the stability test indicated that the I-RC/PtTi retained its initial high activity with no significant degradation (Figure 3f). In contrast, the B-RC/PtTi experienced a sharp increase in potential after less than 130 hours of continuous OER catalysis, indicating rapid deactivation. Upon further increasing the test current density to 250 mAcm <sup>2</sup> , I-RC/PtTi demonstrated continuous operation for 300 hours without a significant rise in overpotential, whereas B-RC/PtTi showed a pronounced increase in overpotential in less than 50 hours (Figure 3g). This clearly underscores the exceptional stability of I-RC/PtTi.

To further investigate the dissolution of Ru from the catalyst during the stability test, the electrolyte was sampled at various intervals, and the concentration of Ru in the electrolyte was measured to calculate the percentage of Ru dissolved from the I-RC/PtTi (Figure S22). Before the stability test, I-RC/PtTi was immersed in 0.5 M H2SO4 for 1 hour to monitor any residual unstable Ru species from the preparation process. The results showed that the percentage of Ru dissolved after immersion was less than 0.1%, demonstrating excellent inherent corrosion resistance. Once the reaction began, the percentage of dissolved Ru gradually increased, reaching 2.5% after 10 hours, and then stabilized. After 300 hours of testing, the Ru dissolution percentage had only risen to 3.1%. Additionally, similar changes to

those observed for Ru were also detected in the chloride ions present in the electrolyte. These findings suggest that the stable structure of the I-RC/PtTi effectively inhibits the formation of soluble RuO4 <sup>2</sup> species under high oxidative potential, resulting in outstanding stability and a marked improvement over the binder-based powdered catalysts.

#### *2.3 The origin of the excellent OER stability*

Previous studies on the mechanisms have demonstrated that in acidic OER, the AEM exclusively involved adsorbed species (\*OH, \*O, and \*OOH intermediates) without the participation of lattice oxygen, thereby favoring the longterm stability of the catalyst structure under operational conditions.[1a,5] Therefore, modulating the reaction pathway of the catalyst to suppress the LOM and promote the dominance of the AEM pathway is crucial for enhancing stability.[36] Consequently, we employed advanced in situ measurements to explore the influence of Cl incorporation on the reaction mechanism of RuO2. Conventional RuO2 not only engages in the AEM pathway but also exhibits a prominent LOM pathway during OER,[26] where the involvement of lattice oxygen accelerates the formation of oxygen vacancies and the leaching of Ru, ultimately leading to the collapse of the crystal structure. In contrast, the stability of RuO2-Cl is significantly improved, likely due to the suppression of the LOM pathway and the predominance of the AEM pathway.

To substantiate the OER pathway on these catalysts, in situ 18O isotope-labeling differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS) measurements were conducted. The catalysts were initially drop-coated on gas-permeable porous gold working electrodes, followed by labeling with 18O isotopes through a potentiostatic reaction in H2 18O/0.5 M H2SO4 aqueous electrolyte (Figure 4a, Figures S23–24). If lattice oxygen exchange occurs, the catalyst surface will incorporate 18O.[6] Subsequently, we analyzed the isotopic signal of O2 released during the OER process in H2 16O/ 0.5 M H2SO4 (Figures S25–26). As the OER current gradually increased, a simultaneous rise in both 32O2 ( 16O+16O) and 34O2 ( 16O+18O) signals was observed, while the production of 36O2 was absent based on the mass signals (Figure S26). Particularly noteworthy was the observation that the ratio of 34O2 to 32O2 signals on RuO2-Cl across the OER potential range was consistently lower in comparison to pure RuO2 (Figure 4b), suggesting that the involvement of lattice oxygen in the OER process was suppressed on RuO2-Cl relative to the pure RuO2. Conclusively, the LOM pathway of the RuO2-Cl sample was greatly hindered, providing robust evidence for its enhanced stability in acidic OER conditions.

Given that attenuated total reflection-surface enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR-SEIRAS) can sensitively monitor surface reaction intermediates under applied potentials, it was employed to investigate the OER mechanism of the catalysts. As illustrated in Figures 4c and d, the sharp peak at 1240 cm <sup>1</sup> can be ascribed to the Si-O Si vibration of the silicon prism.[40] In situ ATR-SEIRAS spectra for RuO2-Cl at various working potentials display an intensive absorption peak at 1200 cm 1[41] and a distinct peak at 1030 cm 1[42] (Figure 4c), which is linked to the bending and stretching vibration of surface-adsorbed OOH\*, respectively, a characteristic intermediate for the AEM pathway. In contrast, RuO2 exhibits only a weak absorption peak at 1030 cm <sup>1</sup> (Figure 4d), indicating that the O O stretching vibrations of the adsorbed OOH species on its surface are too faint to detect, with bending vibrations also being minimal. As the potential increases, the absorption peak of RuO2 becomes significantly lower compared to that of RuO2-Cl, suggesting that the reaction on RuO2 predominantly proceeds via a combined LOM-AEM pathway, whereas the reaction on RuO2-Cl primarily follows the AEM pathway. Furthermore, the intensity of the OOH peak on RuO2-Cl increases rapidly in a nearly linear fashion as the OER potential rises from 1.40 V to 1.50 V (Figure 4e), before stabilizing at a relatively constant level. In contrast, RuO2 exhibits a discernible increase in the OOH peak intensity only between 1.40 and 1.45 V, after which it levels off at a lower intensity. This observation suggests that the introduction of Cl ions could raise the onset potential for the LOM mechanism, thereby diminishing its impact (Figure 4f).

Furthermore, we investigated the effect of chloride ions in the electrolyte on the activity of RuO2, aiming to determine whether they exert a poisoning effect on the catalyst. The catalytic activity of RuO2 was evaluated as the chloride concentration in the solution was progressively increased from 1 ppm to 0.1 M. The results revealed that the activity of RuO2 gradually decreased as the chloride concentration rose from 1 ppm to 500 ppm (Figure S27a, 28). However, at a concentration of 0.1 M, a significant decrease in the onset overpotential and a notable increase in current density were observed, primarily due to the onset of the chlorine evolution reaction (CER). After removing the catalyst and rinsing it thoroughly with deionized water, we tested its activity in fresh 0.5 M H2SO4. Compared to its initial performance prior to chloride addition, the catalyst exhibited diminished activity, indicating partial poisoning. This effect is attributed to the adsorption of chloride ions onto the coordinatively unsaturated Ru sites, from which desorption is difficult.

Notably, the RuO2-Cl catalyst displayed a different response to varying chloride concentrations in the electrolyte, contrasting with the behavior of pure RuO2. As the chloride ion concentration increased from 1 ppm to 500 ppm, the LSV curves remained nearly identical (Figure S27b, 29), indicating that the catalyst's activity did not decrease with the rise in chloride concentration. However, when the chloride concentration was further increased to 0.1 M, similar to RuO2, the CER was triggered, resulting in a lower onset potential and an increase in current density. However, after the RuO2-Cl catalyst was rinsed with deionized water, and retested in fresh 0.5 M H2SO4, its activity showed no decline compared to its initial state, indicating resistance to chloride poisoning. This behavior is likely due to the substitution of bridging oxygen by chloride within the catalyst structure, which regulates the coordina-

tion of under-coordinated Ru sites. This adjustment stabilizes Ru in a lower oxidation state, reducing chloride adsorption and thereby mitigating the poisoning process.

#### 2.4 Density functional theory (DFT) simulation

To elucidate the mechanisms by which Cl influences the activity and stability of RuO<sub>2</sub>-Cl in acidic environments, we conducted DFT simulations. We selected the thermodynamically most stable (110) surface of RuO<sub>2</sub> for this investigation into its OER activity. Various configurations of Cl atoms on the RuO<sub>2</sub> (110) surface were considered, differing in both quantity and position (Figures S30–32). Structural optimization revealed that the highest formation

energy (5.42 eV) was associated with Cl insertion into interstitial lattice sites, indicating that Cl atoms preferentially substituted for oxygen rather than occupying interstitial sites (Figure S30). Notably, the most stable configuration involved Cl substitution for two opposing bridging oxygen atoms (O<sub>br</sub>), which exhibited a significantly lower formation energy (-4.39 eV) than other substitution or doping configurations, suggesting this was the thermodynamically favored structure (Figure S31). Consequently, this configuration was adopted as the model for subsequent RuO<sub>2</sub>-Cl catalyst simulations. Differential charge density indicated that Cl substitution for bridging oxygen resulted in charge accumulation at adjacent tri-coordinated oxygen (O<sub>3f</sub>) sites in the outermost layer and at the corresponding coordinatively unsaturated sites Ru (Ru<sub>cus</sub>) atoms (Figure 5a), which

promoted the stabilization of Ru in a lower oxidation state. Bader charge analysis further confirmed that the presence of Cl led to a reduced oxidation state for Rucus (Figure 5b), consistent with the differential charge density findings.

To evaluate the impact of Cl on catalytic activity and stability, we calculated Gibbs free energy changes and lattice stability for both the AEM and LOM pathways. In the AEM pathway, the formation of \*OOH was identified as the rate-limiting step for both RuO2-Cl and RuO2 (Figure 5c, Figure S33–34). The Gibbs free energy change for OOH formation on RuO2-Cl was found to be 1.78 eV, lower than the 1.91 eV observed for RuO2. Consequently, the OER limiting potential for the RuO2-Cl surface was determined to be 1.78 V, approximately 0.13 V lower than that of RuO2, indicating enhanced activity due to Cl substitution. In contrast, in the LOM pathway, the highest free energy change step involved the coupling of adsorbed oxygen with lattice oxygen to form and desorb oxygen gas, with free energies of 3.65 eV for RuO2 and 4.17 eV for RuO2-Cl (Figure 5d, Figure S35–37). These values are 1.74 eV and 2.39 eV higher, respectively, than those in the AEM pathway. The increased difference in the maximum free energy change between AEM and LOM on RuO2-Cl indicates further suppression of the LOM pathway, thereby stabilizing lattice oxygen. The reduction in the maximum Gibbs free energy change in the AEM pathway for RuO2-Cl is primarily attributed to the enhanced adsorption of OOH. To probe this further, we calculated the electron localization function (ELF) of the adsorbed OOH (Figure 5e), which revealed higher ELF values on RuO2-Cl, indicative of stronger covalent bonding,[43] thus stabilizing OOH adsorption at Rucus sites. Additionally, Bader charge analysis

demonstrated that electron transfer from the substrate to the adsorbed OOH on RuO2-Cl was 0.063 j ej higher than on RuO2 (Figure 5f), further confirming the more stable binding of the OOH intermediate on RuO2-Cl. Furthermore, the deprotonation of the \*OOH intermediate was more favorable on RuO2-Cl, where hydrogen bonding facilitated the spontaneous transfer of a proton from \*OOH to a neighboring bridging oxygen, forming \*OO (Fig-

ure S38). To understand the suppression of the LOM pathway on RuO2-Cl, projected density of states (PDOS) calculations were performed (Figure 5g). These revealed that the introduction of Cl shifted the O 2p band center from 2.95 eV (RuO2) to 3.25 eV (RuO2-Cl), indicating further passivation of lattice oxygen, rendering it less reactive. Additionally, the Ru d-band center on RuO2-Cl was found to be further from the Fermi level (Ef) compared to RuO2, suggesting increased electron occupancy in the d-band, in agreement with the differential charge and Bader charge analyses. Notably, the introduction of Cl increased the difference between the Ru 3d and O 2p band centers from 1.69 eV to 1.87 eV, implying a weakened Ru O bond covalency on RuO2-Cl,[18] which contributed to the suppression of the LOM mechanism and enhanced stability. Furthermore, the enthalpy change associated with subsurface oxygen loss was calculated to assess lattice oxygen stability. The presence of Cl nearly doubled the enthalpy for subsurface oxygen loss, increasing it from 1.65 eV in RuO2 to 3.24 eV in RuO2-Cl (Figure 5h, Figure S39), indicating enhanced lattice oxygen stability in the Cl-incorporated RuO2. As the oxidation and loss of Ru metal are critical factors in catalyst degradation, the enthalpy change for Ru demetallation is also calculated here. The energy required for Ru demetallation on RuO2-Cl is 2.93 eV, nearly twice that of pure RuO2 (1.63 eV), suggesting that Cl incorporation enhances the resistance of RuO2 to demetallation (Figure 5i, Figure S40). The above DFT calculations, consistent with DEMS results, demonstrate that Cl incorporation suppresses the LOM pathway, directing the OER to follow the AEM pathway. By strengthening the binding of the OOH intermediate and lowering the reaction's limiting potential, Cl incorporation ultimately enhances the electrocatalytic performance of RuO2.

## *3. Conclusion*

In summary, we synthesized chlorine-containing RuO2 and pure RuO2 catalysts with comparable morphology and crystallinity. Notably, the RuO2-Cl catalysts exhibited superior activity and stability in acidic OER. The incorporation of chlorine effectively reduced the energy barrier of the rate-determining step by optimizing the binding strength of \*OOH intermediates at the Rucus sites, thus enhancing OER activity. Crucially, the double substitution of bridging oxygen atoms by chlorine effectively weakens the covalency of Ru O bonds. Consequently, the RuO2-Cl catalyst was able to suppress the LOM pathway, demonstrating remarkable stability. Furthermore, RuO2-Cl that was in situ grown on a platinum-coated titanium felt collector, forming a RuO2-Cl/ PtTi composites, exhibited exceptional stability, maintaining high performance for up to 1200 hours under 100 mAcm <sup>2</sup> . This study provides valuable insights into designing advanced OER catalysts with enhanced stability and gain new insights into the effects of chlorine residues on the performance of RuO2.

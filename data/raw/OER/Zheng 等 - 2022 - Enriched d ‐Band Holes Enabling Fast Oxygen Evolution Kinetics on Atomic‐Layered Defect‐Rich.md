## **Abstract:**

Developing a reliable synthesis strategy to concurrently realize electronic structure modulation and two-dimensionalization of materials is of paramount significance, yet still challenging. Herein, we report a facile and universal strategy to fabricate defect-abundant atomic-layered materials with unique electronic structure by mechanical shear-assisted exfoliation. As a proof-of-concept demonstration, we have successfully synthesized atomic-layered defect-rich LiCoO<sup>2</sup> nanosheets (AD-LCO), which enable accelerated oxygen evolution kinetics with a substantially decreased OER overpotential by 184 mV and 216 mV at 10 mA cm-2 and 50 mA cm-2 , respectively. X-ray absorption spectroscopy suggests that AD-LCO possesses more *d*-band holes and enhanced Co-O covalency. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the presence of Co lattice vacancies could optimize the adsorption kinetics of intermediates, consequently lowering the energy barrier of the rate-determining step. Importantly, this method has universal applicability to the fabrication of other ultrathin defect-rich two-dimensional (2D) materials such as BN, WS2, and MoS2. The work has potential implications for offering novel insights into the rational design of ultrathin 2D materials with abundant surface defects for various applications.

## **1. Introduction**

Recent advances in the controllable synthesis of materials, combined with the establishment of fundamental structure-activity relationships, have encouraged a burgeoning interest in the development and design of efficient catalysts.[1] Tremendous efforts have been made to the rational construction of catalysts featuring optimized structure, morphology and coordination environments to approach the activity limit.[2] As a result, design strategies, such as nanostructuring,[3] strain tuning,[4] heterostructure engineering,[5] two-dimensionalization,[6] defect tailoring,[7] and single atom engineering,[8] have been exploited. One particularly promising strategy is two-dimensional (2D) engineering, which not only endows catalyst the possibility with much more exposed active sites but also the accelerated reaction kinetics, resulting in the concurrently increased number of active sites and enhanced intrinsic activity.[9] However, achieving atomic-layered catalyst featuring abundant catalytically active centers via a facile strategy still remains a daunting scientific challenge, and therefore it is highly desirable to explore an effective synthesis strategy to address this dilemma.

Numerous bottom-up and top-down synthesis strategies, such as self-assembly, epitaxial growth, exfoliation, 2D template synthesis, and topochemical transformation, have been developed to prepare atomic-layered 2D materials[10] . Most of these strategies could ensure the thickness with atomic layers and boosted catalytic activity via precisely tailoring the synthesis conditions. In spite of this, these strategies usually involve complicated synthesis procedures and high-cost equipment or harsh treatment such as hydrofluoric (HF) acid etching, which largely inhibit their large-scale applications.[11] In addition, defect engineering has been considered as an effective strategy to tune the local electronic structure and manipulate the strain and coordination environment of active sites to elevate the intrinsic activity of catalysts.[12] [13] Therefore, development of ultrathin 2D materials with rich defects

and optimal electronic structure to synergistically boost the catalytic performance is of paramount significance by combined 2D and defect engineering.[14] As a result, various synthesis strategies have been developed to acquire 2D materials with abundant deficiencies. However, most synthesis methods feature complex fabrication processes, in which the process of defect formation and two-dimensionalization are usually separated.[15] Consequently, it still remains a critical challenge to develop a facile, low-cost and reliable synthesis strategy to concurrently realize the electronic structure modulation and two-dimensionalization of materials.

Herein, we report a facile and universal route to fabricate few-layered 2D materials with abundant surface defects via a mechanical shear-assisted exfoliation strategy, which has concurrently realized the electronic structure modulation and two-dimensionalization. As a proof-of-concept study, we have successfully synthesized atomic-layered LiCoO<sup>2</sup> nanosheets with rich surface defects. The obtained AD-LCO features significantly enriched *d*-band holes and boosted OER kinetics, leading to substantially decreased OER overpotential and kinetic barriers. Theoretical calculations indicate that the presence of Co vacancies contributes to faster charge transfer kinetics and a smaller energy barrier for the rate-determining step. Significantly, our method has broad applicability for the fabrication of other 2D layered materials such as BN, WS<sup>2</sup> and MoS2, so that it can be a universal and effective strategy to develop defect-rich 2D electrocatalysts.

## **2. Results and discussions**

**Synthesis and characterizations of AD-LCO.** The bulk LiCoO<sup>2</sup> (LCO) was exfoliated into nanosheets by a high shear mixer, and then the obtained LCO nanosheets were subjected to a second shear exfoliation process followed by high-speed centrifugation to obtain the final AD-LCO products (Figure S1 and S2, Supporting Information). As indicated in the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern (Figure S2b and 2c, Supporting Information), the particle size of LCO was reduced dramatically, as verified by the widened diffraction peak of AD-LCO. The slight downshift of the (003) peak of AD-LCO suggested a small expansion of the *c*-axis caused by the reduced thickness after exfoliation. The peak shifting and broadening indicated the possible presence of local structural disorder and strain in the AD-LCO.[16] Meanwhile, the expansion of the *c*-axis was further verified by the Raman spectra (Figure S2d, Supporting Information), where the A1g and E<sup>g</sup> peaks of AD-LCO were slightly shifted to lower wavenumbers, in good agreement with the XRD results.[17] Furthermore, the morphology of LCO was altered greatly after exfoliation from micron-sized bulk LCO to few-layer nano-sized LCO nanosheets (Figure S3 and S4, Supporting Information). The ultrathin AD-LCO well dispersed in an aqueous solution with light brown colour, as evidenced by the Tyndall effect under laser irradiation, further verified the successful exfoliation of bulk LCO into nanosheets (Figure S4d, Supporting Information).

To further explore the thickness and structure of the obtained AD-LCO, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high angle annual dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM), and atomic force microscopy (AFM) were conducted. As demonstrated in **Figure 1**a-c and Figure S5, the AD-LCO comprises 1-4 unit cell layers, which equals 3-12 CoO<sup>2</sup> layers as determined by the number of atomic layers along the (001) axis. This is in good agreement with the results of AFM, demonstrating that atomic-layered LCO nanosheets

can be successfully obtained by the combined exfoliation methods (Figure 1d-f). The reduced size and thickness of AD-LCO can also be validated by the substantial enhancement of the specific surface area, which increased from 1.3 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup> in LCO to 40.6 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup> in AD-LCO (Figure S6, Supporting Information). Also, there are abundant edge or step sites formed during the exfoliation, as indicated in the TEM and STEM images, which can be catalytically active centers during the OER process. Apart from the edge and step defects, the HAADF and annular bright field (ABF)-STEM images (Figure 1g and h) indicate that abundant lattice defects such as cation vacancies and local atomic disorder near the margins of AD-LCO nanosheets are also clearly presented, demonstrating that the exfoliation process could also lead to the formation of a slight amount of surface structural disorder and the presence of cation vacancies. This is possibly related to the high-speed rotation of the rotor blade, which could cause large centrifugal force under operation. The resultant intense hydraulic shear accompanied by centrifugal force could induce turbulent flow, where the materials usually interact intensively with eddies, resulting in breakage and defects in the materials [10f, 18]. The strain maps derived from geometric phase analysis (GPA) indicate the much higher amount of strain fluctuation around the edges than in the internal part of AD-LCO, suggesting the presence of abundant local lattice strain (microstrain), which is further correlated with the role of exfoliation in the formation of defects (Figure 1i and Figure S12, Supporting Information). Although crystal defects exist on the margins of nanosheets, the overall crystal structure of AD-LCO can be well-maintained after exfoliation, as demonstrated by the electron microscope characterizations (Figure S6-11, Figure 1f-h). For example, the atomic arrangement of AD-

LCO viewed from the [12 ̅] zone axis is in good accordance with the schematic diagram of LCO projected from the same direction, and the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern provided further evidence to support it with typical {003}, {104}, and {110} facets of LiCoO2(Figure S11, Supporting Information).

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out to reveal the evolution of the electronic structure of AD-LCO. The survey spectrum (Figure S13, Supporting Information) confirms the coexistence of Li, Co, and O. The binding energy of the high-resolution O 1s XPS spectrum (Figure S14, Supporting Information) for AD-LCO showed an obvious positive shift (~1.0 eV) compared to LCO, accompanied by the substantially increased oxygen defect species (~531.7 eV), which might be derived from the enhanced surface defect sites caused by the shear-assisted exfoliation treatment. The shift of the O 1s spectrum suggests a partial oxidation process for O2 and a higher degree of surface coupling in the AD-LCO.[8c] Furthermore, the observed positive shift of Co 2p XPS spectra (**Figure 2**a) for AD-LCO manifests the partial oxidation of Co 3+ to Co4+ , which demonstrates the increased Co 3d band holes and Co-O covalency compared with LCO.[19] To gain information on the local geometry and electronic structures of the obtained samples, X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra were collected. The Co K edge XANES spectra (Figure 2b) further validated the increase in the effective nuclear charge of Co ions and *d*-band holes (Co3+ (3*d* 6 ) → Co4+ (3*d* 5 )) in AD-LCO, as indicated by the positively shifted absorption edge compared with LCO. This implies the decrease of Co 3*d* electron density and increased hybridization of Co 3d-O 2p states in AD-LCO after exfoliation, in good agreement with the above XPS analysis[20]. The Co-K

edge EXAFS of AD-LCO (Figure 2d) shows a main peak at ~1.5 Å, ascribed to the Co-O coordination, and a peak at ~2.5 Å from the second shell Co-Co contribution (edge-sharing octahedral motifs) for both LCO and AD-LCO, suggesting the well-maintained hexagonal crystal structure.[21] It is worth noting, however, that there is a slightly negative shift (~0.02 Å) of the Co-O peak for AD-LCO compared with LCO, further consolidating the slight Co-O bond length contraction and the local distortion of CoO6octahedra in the AD-LCO, possibly originating from the rehybridization of Co and O orbital[22] (Figure S15, Supporting Information). The fitting results for the Fourier-transformed EXAFS spectra (Figure 2e, Figure S16-18, Table S1, Supporting Information) quantitatively reveal that the Co-O bond length in AD-LCO is 1.908 Å, slightly smaller than for LCO (1.918 Å), which undoubtedly provides evidence of Co-O contraction after exfoliation. In addition, the wavelet transform (WT) results further verify the existence of Co-Co and Co-O coordination in LCO and AD-LCO (Figure 2c and 2f, and Figure S19, Supporting Information). Consequently, the XAS together with XPS analysis results evidence the increased *d*-band holes and the much stronger hybridization state of Co 3d and O 2p orbitals in AD-LCO, which may have paramount significance for the OER activity.

**OER performance of AD-LCO.** The OER catalytic activity of AD-LCO was recorded and compared with those of LCO and IrO<sup>2</sup> in 1.0 M KOH solution. As demonstrated in **Figure 3**a, the AD-LCO exhibits the catalytically most active polarization curve with a dramatical increase in current density, implying considerably higher activity than those of LCO and the benchmark IrO2. The onset potential of AD-LCO is only 107 mV, which is much smaller than those of LCO (383 mV) and IrO<sup>2</sup> (292 mV) (Figure S20 and Table S2, Supporting Information). Additionally, AD-LCO delivers a current density of 10 mA cm-2 , which

requires only 280 mV, substantially lower than for LCO (464 mV) and IrO<sup>2</sup> (408 mV) (Figure 3b). When the current density reaches 50 mA cm-2 , the potential gap becomes much bigger, with an overpotential of 307 mV for AD-LCO, 216 and 193 mV smaller than for LCO and IrO2, respectively. Moreover, the AD-LCO possesses a smaller Tafel slope (35.4 mVdec-1 ) than its LCO (64.3 mVdec-1 )) and IrO<sup>2</sup> (109.3 mV·dec-1 ) counterparts, elucidating the remarkably accelerated kinetic process in the AD-LCO (Figure 3c). Impressively, the overall OER activity of AD-LCO outperformed most LiCoO2-based OER electrocatalysts and other layered cobalt-based oxides (Figure 3d and Table S3). The enhanced kinetics was further confirmed by the smaller charge-transfer resistance of AD-LCO (2.6 Ω) compared with LCO (321.3 Ω), manifesting the superior charge

transfer kinetics and mass diffusion for AD-LCO during the catalytic reaction (Figure S21, Supporting Information). Importantly, the turnover frequency (TOF) of AD-LCO increased substantially, so that it was nearly 474 times larger than LCO (0.0004 s-1 ) at an overpotential of 340 mV, unambiguously demonstrating the considerably enhanced intrinsic activity of AD-LCO (Figure 3e). Meanwhile, the double-layer capacitance *C*dl, determined by the cyclic voltammograms (CVs, Figure S22a-c, Supporting Information) of AD-LCO, is 2.56 mF, near 5 times higher than for LCO and IrO2, which suggests the significantly enhanced active site density in AD-LCO (Figure S22d, Supporting Information). The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves normalized by the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) are provided to further access the intrinsic activity of the catalysts (Figure S23, Supporting Information). The results provide evidence that the AD-LCO not only features superiority in its apparent activity but also in its intrinsic activity. The superior activity of AD-LCO can be attributed to the ultrathin structure and the abundant co-existed crystal defects, which ensures the maximal exposure of active sites and the accelerated reaction kinetics. The chronopotentiometry (CP) test (Figure 3g) shows that the AD-LCO exhibits impressive durability with only about 47 mV decay after operating at 50 mA cm<sup>2</sup> for 200 h, which is also validated by chronoamperometry (CA) test (Figure S24, Supporting Information). To decipher the nature of the good durability, electron microscopy characterizations were employed to discern the structural evolution of AD-LCO after the CA test. The characterized results clearly indicated that the AD-LCO possesses good structural stability, as evidenced by the characteristic (003)

and (101) lattice planes of LiCoO<sup>2</sup> (R3 \_ m), with ~0.47 nm and ~0.24 nm spacing, respectively (Figure S25 and 26, Supporting Information). The atomic arrangement of AD-LCO, presented in red rectangle area in Figure S26d, viewed along [121 ] direction, matches well with the schematic illustration of LiCoO<sup>2</sup> projected from the same direction. Inspired by the decent OER activity, a full water-splitting cell was assembled with AD-LCO and Pt/C as the OER and HER electrodes, respectively. The full cell of AD-LCO||Pt/C delivers lower overpotential and excellent stability after 24-h operation at 50 mA cm-2 , surpassing the performance of IrO2||Pt/C (Figure S27 and 28, Supporting Information).

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were further performed to unravel the effect of defects on the electronic properties of AD-LCO and the underlying electrocatalytic mechanism. To establish the actual catalyst model of AD-LCO, the inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) was conducted to trace the Li and Co leaching in AD-LCO during the OER process (Figure R29, Supporting Information). Significant Li leaching occurs during the polarization scans, which achieves dynamic [quasi-equilibrium](javascript:;) state after 100 scans, and the composition of AD-LCO is close to Li0.6CoO<sup>2</sup> after the OER activation process. Therefore, the theoretical calculation models were established with and without a Co vacancy on the Li0.6CoO<sup>2</sup> (104) surface (named as LCO-VCo and LCO, respectively). DFT calculations demonstrate that the presence of Co vacancy could induce charge redistribution and accelerate the electron transport between the active sites and the reaction intermediates, ultimately optimizing the Gibbs free energy of the four elementary steps and lowering the reaction kinetic energy barrier of the rate-determining step (RDS) (**Figure 4**a and 4b, Figure S30a, Supporting Information). Specifically, the calculated OER free-energy diagram indicates that the RDS is the adsorption of \*OH for

LCO, while it changes to the formation of \*O for LCO-VCo. The overpotential for LCO-VCo is 170 mV smaller than LCO at *U* = 1.23 V, where *U* is the potential recorded under standard conditions. Meanwhile, the Co vacancy could narrow the band gap of LCO and increase the electronic states close to the Fermi level, which is beneficial to accelerate the charge transfer kinetics (Figure 4c). In addition, it can be inferred that the Co ions in AD-LCO undergo oxidation during the anodic polarization, resulting in partial oxidation of Co3+ to Co4+ , which is also critical for the enhanced OER activity.[21]

Notably, the lattice distortion of the CoO6octahedral coordination symmetry is enhanced in LCO-VCo as a result of the presence of Co vacancies, which could lead to the enhancement of Co 3d-O 2p hybridization states (Figure 4d).[23] As indicated in the projected density of states of O 2p (Figure S30b, Supporting Information), LCO-VCo exhibits obvious electronic delocalization and increased electronic states near the Fermi level compared with LCO, evidencing the improved metal-oxygen covalency, which is of benefit for rapid OER kinetics. Moreover, the atomic-layered structure accompanying surface defects offers abundant open sites for the adsorption of species for reaction and reduces the length of diffusion paths, which could ensure the maximal exposure of activity centers and endow AD-LCO with accelerated oxygen evolution kinetics. Therefore, we argue that tailoring the geometric and electronic structure at the atomic level through 2D and defect engineering induced by mechanical shear-assisted exfoliation can be an effective strategy to simultaneously enhance the apparent and intrinsic activity of AD-LCO, yielding superior OER activity and long-term durability.

To study the generality of this fabrication strategy for layered materials, we extended it to the preparation of ultrathin BN (E-BN), WS<sup>2</sup> (E-WS), and MoS<sup>2</sup> (E-MS) nanosheets with defects. The results of XRD (Figure S31-33, Supporting Information), scanning electron

microscopy (SEM) (Figure S34-36, Supporting Information), TEM (**Figure 5**a and 5d, Figure S37-40, Supporting Information) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) (Figure 5c and 5f, Figure S38, Supporting Information) characterizations demonstrated that their 2D nanosheets can be successfully fabricated from their bulk forms by the mechanical shear-assisted exfoliation route without obvious structural evolution. The HRTEM and STEM images clearly indicated that abundant crystal defects could be found near the edges of E-MS, E-WS, and E-BN nanosheets. The ABF-STEM image of E-BN, with characterized (100) and (101) lattice planes of BN, viewed along the [01 1 ] zone axis, featured obvious defects at the edges of nanosheets. (Figure 5b). Additionally, step, terrace, and edge defects were observed in STEM and HRTEM images of E-MS and E-WS (Figure 5e and Figure S39 and 41, Supporting Information). Our present study suggests that this unique mechanical shear-exfoliation strategy has the potential to be a universal synthesis route for fabricating defective ultrathin 2D materials, which is possibly transferable to other types of layered materials.

## **3. Conclusion**

In summary, we developed a facile and universal strategy to synchronously realize the electronic structure modulation and two-dimensionalization of materials. Take lithium cobalt oxide as an example, we have successfully fabricated atomic-layered defect-rich LiCoO<sup>2</sup>

nanosheets for water electro-oxidation by the mechanical shear-assisted exfoliation strategy. The as-prepared AD-LCO, featuring more *d*-band holes and enhanced Co-O covalency, exhibited considerably boosted OER activity, with a low overpotential (280 mV) and Tafel slope (35.4 mV dec-1 ), and good durability in an alkaline medium. The considerably enhanced OER performance of AD-LCO can be attributed to the coupling interactions of the maximally enhanced exposure of catalytically active sites and the optimized electronic structure for oxygen reaction kinetics caused by the rich surface defects derived from mechanical exfoliation. Significantly, this present work suggests a powerful strategy to fabricate ultrathin 2D materials with rich defects, which is expected to be effective for other layered structure materials.

## **4. Experimental Section**

**Chemicals:** Lithium cobalt oxide (99.8%), iridium oxide (99.9%), molybdenum disulfide (99.9%) tungsten disulfide (99.9%), boron nitride (98%), N,N-dimethylformamide (99.8%), isopropanol (99.5%) and Nafion® 117 solution were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.

**Preparation of exfoliated LiCoO<sup>2</sup> nanosheets:** First, bulk LiCoO<sup>2</sup> powders (15 g) were added into 150 ml ethanol and then mixed for 15 minutes under an ultrasonic cleaner to achieve a homogeneous suspension. Thereafter, the as-prepared suspension was subjected to an exfoliation process by a high shear laboratory mixer (L5M) with a rotor (30 mm in diameter) running at 5000 rpm for 30 min. The obtained solution was centrifuged at 2500 rpm for 15 min to remove the unexfoliated bulk material. The supernatant was exfoliated once again at 5500 rpm for 120 min. The obtained solution was centrifuged at 6000 rpm for

15 min to obtain the atomic-layered LiCoO<sup>2</sup> nanosheets. The resultant suspension was then collected, freeze-dried, and stored in a vacuum drier for further use. To avoid a substantial increase in temperature, ice cubes were continuously added to the water bath during the exfoliation.

**Preparation of exfoliated MoS2, WS<sup>2</sup> and BN nanosheets:** Bulk MoS<sup>2</sup> (WS2) powders (4 g) or h-BN powders (2 g) were added into 150 ml N,N-dimethylformamide, and then mixed for 15 minutes to achieve a homogeneous suspension under an ultrasonic cleaner. The following synthesis process was the same as for the fabrication of LiCoO<sup>2</sup> nanosheets.

**Physical characterization:** X-ray diffraction (XRD) was conducted on a GBC MMA X-ray diffractometer, and the morphology of all samples was characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM; JEM-2010) and field emission scanning electron microscopy (JEOL JSM-7500). Raman spectroscopy was conducted on a JY HR800 spectrometer equipped with a 633 nm laser as the excitation source. High angle annular dark field ‒ scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM) and annular bright field (ABF)-STEM characterizations were performed on a JEOL ARM200F, and X-ray absorption spectra (XAS) measurements were performed on Beamline P64 located at PETRA III, DESY's synchrotron radiation facility (Hamburg, Germany). Analysis of the XAS data was carried out by using the Demeter software.[24] X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was conducted using a SPECS PHOIBOS 100 Analyser installed in a high-vacuum chamber (below 10–<sup>8</sup> mbar), and X-ray excitation was provided by Al Kα radiation with photon energy *hν* = 1486.6 eV at the high voltage of 12 kV and power of 144 W. Analysis of the XPS data was carried out by using the commercial Casa XPS software package. The specific surface areas of the LCO and AD-LCO were determined by the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method based on the nitrogen adsorption/desorption

isotherms (Micromeritics, TriStarII). Atomic force microscope (AFM) measurements were performed on an Asylum MFP‐3D instrument.

**Electrochemical characterization:** The catalyst ink was prepared by dispersing the mixture of the targeted catalyst (4 mg) with VulcanXC-72 carbon (1 mg) into 1 ml mixed solution (5% Nafion solution/deionized water/isopropanol = 4:96:25 in volume). Then 10 μL of homogenously mixed catalyst ink was coated on a polished glassy carbon electrode (0.196 cm 2 ) and dried in ambient air for the following electrochemical testing.

Electrochemical measurements were performed with a rotating disk electrode (RDE) system (Pine Research Instrumentation, US) in 1 M KOH aqueous solution. Hg/HgO and a Pt mesh was deployed as the reference electrode and the counter electrode, respectively. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was conducted at 10 mV s-1 from 1.13-1.83 V (vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)) with a rotation speed of 1600 rpm. The durability measurement was carried out by the chronoamperometry test at an overpotential of 280 mV for 8 h with a rotating disk electrode system and by chronopotentiometry test at a current density of 50 mA cm-2 for 200 h with AD-LCO loaded on the nickel foam electrode. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was conducted in the frequency range of 100 kHz – 0.1 Hz. All the potentials were corrected by the IR drop unless otherwise specified.

The turnover frequency (TOF) values were calculated by the following equation:

$$TOF = \frac{1}{4nF} \tag{1}$$

where *I* is the current (A) at an overpotential of 340 mV, *F* is the Faraday constant (96,485 C mol-1 ), and *n* represents the number of moles of Co in the LCO and AD-LCO.

The electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) of the catalysts was determined by calculating the electrochemical double-layer capacitances (*C*dl) of the catalysts in a non-Faraday region. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves at different scan rates from 40 to 200 mV s-1 were recorded in the voltage range of 0.256 V ‒ 0.356 V vs. Hg/HgO. The *C*dl was evaluated by the following equation:

$$C_{dl} = \frac{|j_a| + |j_c|}{2\theta} \tag{2}$$

Where and (mA cm-2 ) are the anodic and cathodic current density, respectively. is the scan rate (mV s-1 ).

With regard to the electrochemical performance evaluation of full cells, the working electrode was prepared by coating 250 µL catalyst ink on a Ti mesh (loading mass of 1 mg cm-2 ) followed by drying in ambient air. AD-LCO and Pt/C were employed as the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst and cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalyst, respectively, to construct the full cell of AD-LCO||Pt/C. For comparison, the IrO2||Pt/C cell was assembled with commercial IrO2nanoparticles (NPs) and Pt/C as the anode catalyst and cathode catalyst, respectively. The durability was performed by chronopotentiometry measurement at a current density of 50 mA cm-2 in 1M KOH solution. *IR* correction was not applied for the overall water splitting test.

**Computational methods**: First-principle calculations were conducted by using the CASTEP package code with density-functional theory (DFT).[25] The data were collected using generalized gradient approximation with the Perdue–Burke–Ernzerhof exchange-correlation function.[26] The cut-off energy of the plane wave was set at 450 eV, and a Monkhorst-Pack 2 × 3 × 1 k-point grid was adopted to sample the Brillouin zone[27]. A vacuum region of 15 Å

was applied to rule out interactions between the neighboring cells of slab models. The theoretical calculation models were established with and without a Co vacancy on the Li0.6CoO<sup>2</sup> (104) surface. The lattice parameters were fully relaxed, and the geometry of the calculation model was fully optimized before the electron structure and total energy calculations. All the atoms were relaxed until the energy converged to less than 10-5 eV per atom and the forces on each atom converged to 0.05 eV Å-1 .

The elementary steps are regarded as the following equations:

$$2H_2O + * \rightarrow OH^* + H_2O + e^- + H^+$$
(3)

$$OH^* + H_2O \rightarrow O^* + H_2O + e^- + H^+$$
 (4)

$$O^* + H_2O \to OOH^* + e^- + H^+$$
 (5)

$$OOH^* \rightarrow O_2 + e^- + H^+ \tag{6}$$

The Gibbs free energy of the elementary steps is calculated as:

$$\Delta G_1 = \Delta G_{OH} - eU \tag{7}$$

$$\Delta G_2 = \Delta G_O - \Delta G_{OH} - eU \tag{8}$$

$$\Delta G_3 = \Delta G_{OOH} - \Delta G_O - eU \tag{9}$$

$$\Delta G_4 = 4.92 \text{ eV} + \Delta G_{OOH} - eU \tag{10}$$

Where *U* is the potential recorded under standard conditions (vs. RHE). The \* represents the adsorption site, and OH\*, O\*, and OOH\* are the proposed OER reaction intermediates.

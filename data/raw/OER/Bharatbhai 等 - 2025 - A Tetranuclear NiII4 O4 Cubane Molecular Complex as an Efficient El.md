**The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is integral to electrochemical energy systems; however, its intrinsic sluggish kinetics necessitate the design of high-performance electrocatalysts to minimize overpotential, enhance the durability, and optimize the efficiency. Significant efforts have been dedicated to developing OER catalysts based on earth-abundant transition-metal complexes. Here, the efficacy of a tetranuclear cubane-cored Ni(II) complex, [Ni4(LH)4(MeOH)]·CHCl3 (1), in OER is demonstrated. The complex is synthesized using a tetradentate Schiff-base ligand, [2-{(***E***)-(2 hydroxyphenylimino)methyl)-6-(hydroxymethyl)-4-methylphenol}], and characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The redox properties of complex 1 are evaluated by cyclic voltammetry in the solid state, which emphasize the quasireversible oxidation state of the Ni(II) metal center. The complex 1 is immobilized on activated carbon cloth (CC), referred as CC-1, which demonstrates efficient OER catalysis, subsequently activating to form the Ni(O)OH catalyst. The postreaction analysis including UV–vis, FTIR, scanning electron microscopy–energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirm the stability of molecular complex 1. The results demonstrate efficient OER catalysis with a low overpotential of 330 mV versus reversible hydrogen electrode and a Tafel slope of 64 mV dec<sup>−</sup>1, confirming an effective OER catalyst in alkaline medium with a deep understanding of the core reaction mechanisms.**

# **1. Introduction**

Driven by the exhaustion of fossil fuel reserves, including petroleum, coal, and natural gas, along with increasing energy demand and the repercussions of global warming, significant global efforts have emerged to develop cost-effective energy storage technologies and alternative sources of energy, including metal– air batteries, fuel cells, and water electrolysis, without exacerbating environmental strain.[\[1–4\]](#page-11-0) The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is an elementary electrochemical reaction process in rechargeable metal–air batteries and electrochemical water splitting.[\[5,6\]](#page-11-0) Metal–air batteries are potentially a very high energy storage and energy density technology, with the OER being a critical reaction in the charging process.[\[7–9\]](#page-11-0) Electrocatalytic water oxidation is regarded as a compelling strategy for sustainable production of clean energy, particularly hydrogen, in the form of chemical feedstocks that are easily stored and transported by converting intermittent

renewable resources such as solar and wind energy into electricity.[10-13] However, the sluggish kinetics associated with the OER hinder the widespread adoption of solar energy as an ultimate power source. The OER process is particularly challenging because of its high overpotential, which necessitates complex processes including O-H bond cleavage, O-O bond formation, and 4H<sup>+</sup>/4e<sup>-</sup> transfer steps.<sup>[14]</sup> Thus, minimizing the overpotential of the OER is a key condition for enhancing the efficiency of the water-splitting reactions.[15,16]

Despite this challenge, Ir- and Ru-based catalysts have been extensively studied as high-performance OER catalysts.[17-22] However, their extensive application is constrained by the economic unfamiliarity and scarcity. To address these issues, research efforts have been focused on the development of OER catalysts based on earth-abundant transition-metal oxides. [23-26] Currently, cost-effective, earth-abundant first-row transition metals such as Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu have garnered attention as promising OER catalysts under basic conditions. [27–37] Among them, earthabundant and biologically essential nickel metal has been investigated for the development of effective electrocatalysts for OER activity at lower overpotentials with high reaction rates and good catalytic stability.[38-41] Despite their potential, wellstudied nickel-based materials such as nickel oxides/hydroxides face certain challenges in identifying the reactive surface structure and active sites, resulting in divergences in the reported extrinsic parameters for the OER.[42,43] To address these challenges, recent studies have focused on advanced characterization techniques and computational studies to understand the atomicscale kinetics of the OER as well as the mechanism.[44-48] Even though these methods have produced useful results, computational models often depend a lot on estimates due to unclear catalytic structures and how molecules are arranged. Therefore, it is essential to identify the actual working catalysts to enable structural alterations that enhance catalytic performance and delineate the structure–property relationship. [49–51] Recognizing the importance of tailoring the catalyst properties, nickel-based molecular electrocatalysts have well-defined structures isolated via singlecrystal X-ray diffraction and supplemented by various spectroscopic techniques and computational analyses to facilitate the prediction of actual catalytic pathways.<sup>[52–56]</sup> These catalysts can be tuned by modifying the electronic and steric properties of the ligands, underscoring the importance of tailored design in catalyst development.[57]

Building on this foundation of molecular design, Lu and coworkers reported water oxidation using macrocyclic Ni complexes under homogeneous conditions. The Ni complex exhibited robust stability and efficiently oxidized water at neutral pH with a low overpotential.<sup>[58]</sup> Cao and co-workers reported porphyrin nickel complexes for water oxidation. [39] Wang et al. reported a molecular Ni-PY5 complex that showed 90% Faradic efficiency.<sup>[59]</sup> Kumar and co-workers studied a series of homolep-

tic and heteroleptic Ni(II) complexes derived from thiolate ligands and reported their electrocatalytic properties for the oxygen evolution reaction.<sup>[60]</sup> Kamboj and Metre reported a dinuclear nickel complex with a phenalenyl-derived Schiffligand base with an efficiently catalyzed electrochemical OER with a very low overpotential.<sup>[61]</sup> Importantly, the activation mechanism of these complexes provides insights into the catalytic process. Through electrochemical activation in an alkaline medium, the Ni(II) complex undergoes a series of electron transfers, and the formation of an active Ni(O)(OH) intermediate (catalyst) facilitates the formation of an O-O bond. This mechanism is widely recognized as an active catalyst and is well established for both heterogeneous and molecular electrocatalysts. [62-64] The research on nickel-based molecular complexes as OER catalysts is predominantly limited to mono- and dinuclear coordination complexes. [65-67] It is well documented that different multimetallic molecular cluster systems can significantly enhance both the catalytic activity and stability of OER catalysts through cooperative or synergistic effects. [68,69] Despite this knowledge, the exploration of polynuclear nickel complexes as OER catalysts remains limited in the literature. Notably, here it is interesting to mention that the heterocubane Mn<sub>3</sub>CaO<sub>4</sub> system is also a multimetallic system, which serves as the active site of the natural oxygen-evolving complex in photosystem II.[70]

Inspired by the aforementioned studies, we have synthesized a non-noble-metal-based tetranuclear cubane like complex of [Ni<sub>4</sub>(LH)<sub>4</sub>(MeOH)]·CHCl<sub>3</sub> (1). Complex 1 was immobilized on the surface of an activated carbon cloth (CC), which served as the working electrode, referred to as CC-1, in electrocatalytic water oxidation studies in alkaline aqueous media. The results demonstrated efficient catalytic activity toward the electrochemical OER, achieving a notably low overpotential of 328 mV versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and a Tafel slope of  $64 \text{ mV dec}^{-1}$ .

## 2. Results and Discussion

## 2.1. Synthesis Aspect

In a previous study, we reported that the Schiff base ligand ([2-{(E)-(2-hydroxyphenylimino)methyl)-6-(hydroxymethyl)-4-methylphenol}], LH<sub>3</sub>) was synthesized by the condensation reaction of 2-aminophenol and 2-(hydroxymethyl)-6-carbaldehyde-4-methylphenol<sup>[71,72]</sup> in methanol under reflux conditions. We have reported the efficacy of the ligand for assembling pentanuclear spirocyclic  $Ni_4Ln$  ( $Ln = Gd^{III}$ ,  $Tb^{III}$ ,  $Dy^{III}$ ,  $Er^{III}$ , and YIII) complexes and subsequently investigated its coordination capabilities with lanthanide ions to construct Ln<sub>7</sub> (Ln = Tb<sup>III</sup>, Dy<sup>III</sup>, and Er<sup>III</sup>) complexes.<sup>[73,74]</sup> These findings prompted us to further explore the versatility of LH<sub>3</sub> in assembling homometallic-transition-metal-based complexes. Subsequently, the reaction of LH3 with nickel(II) acetylacetonate in a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio along with three equivalents of triethylamine in a stirred CHCl<sub>3</sub> and CH<sub>3</sub>OH (1:1) solvent mixture produced greenish crystals of the tetranuclear cubane-cored compound [Ni<sub>4</sub>(LH)<sub>4</sub>(MeOH)]·CHCl<sub>3</sub> (1 Scheme 1) upon slow evaporation, with moderate yields (>50%, see the Experimental Section).

## 2.2. Structural Description of the Complex

Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis revealed that the  $[Ni_4(LH)_4(MeOH)]$ -CHCl<sub>3</sub> (1) cluster crystallized in triclinic system with P-1 space-group (Z=2). Figure 1a exhibits the molecular structure of 1. The relevant bond lengths and angles are listed in Table S1 (Supporting Information). The crystallographic data and refinement parameters for 1 are given in Table S2 (Supporting Information).

The asymmetric unit of 1 contains one neutral [Ni<sub>4</sub>(LH)<sub>4</sub>(MeOH)] molecule and one chloroform molecule

of crystallization. The complex **1** has a tetranuclear distorted cubic core (Figure 1), which is encapsulated by four double deprotonated (LH)<sup>2-</sup> ligands, having two of the three hydroxyl groups of each ligand being deprotonated. Here, two different types of binding modes were utilized by (LH)<sup>2-</sup> ligands to construct the overall core. Three of the ligands act in a hexadentate manner, utilizing all their binding sites to coordinate with three Ni<sup>11</sup> ions in a  $\mu_3$ - $\eta^1$ : $\eta^1$ : $\eta^3$ : $\eta^1$  fashion. Each dianionic ligand (LH)<sup>2-</sup> provides two phenolate oxygen atoms in the  $\mu_3$  and  $\eta^1$  modes, respectively, one imino  $\eta^1$ -nitrogen atom, and one alkoxy  $\eta^1$ -oxygen atom (Scheme 2). The fourth ligand utilized a pentadentate binding

mode  $(\mu_3 - \eta^1 : \eta^1 : \eta^3)$  with a similar binding mode of two phenolate oxygen atoms and one imino nitrogen atom to simultaneously accommodate the three Ni<sup>II</sup> ions, while an alkoxy oxygen atom was not utilized for coordination (Scheme 2).

Subsequent structural analysis revealed intriguing insights into the structure. In the tetranuclear distorted cubic core, four  $Ni^{II}$  ions and four  $\mu_3$ -phenolate oxygen atoms from four deprotonated Schiff-base ligands ((LH)<sup>2-</sup>) are positioned at alternating vertices of the cube. It is important to note that the four Ni<sup>II</sup> ions have analogous coordination environments; however, the molecular components are not crystallographically symmetry related. Each Ni(II) ion in the cubane is hexa-coordinated with the (NO<sub>5</sub>) environment and exhibits a slightly distorted octahedral geometry, as indicated by the SHAPE parameter for the octahedral geometry (Figure 1 and Table S3 (Supporting Information)).<sup>[75]</sup> The ligands (L<sup>2-</sup>) utilize one  $\eta^1$ -pheonolate oxygen atom, two  $\mu_3$ -pheonolate oxygen atoms, and one  $\eta^1$ -imino N atom to construct the square base of the octahedron, while the axial positions of the octahedron are occupied by one  $\mu_3$ -pheonolate oxygen atom and either one alkoxy  $\eta^1$ -oxygen atom or a methanol solvent molecule. Table \$1 (Supporting Information) illustrates that the Ni-O bond lengths, ranging from 1.969(3) to 2.329(3) Å, were marginally longer than the Ni-N bond lengths, ranging from 1.966(4) to 1.991(4) Å. The intracluster Ni···Ni distances within the core are in the range of 3.041-3.162 Å, and the angle between Ni-O-Ni spans from 89.01° to 106.22°, which are comparable to values reported in the literature for other Ni<sub>4</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, as summarized in Table 1.[76-82] Strong hydrogen bonding between the chloroform hydrogen and benzylic oxygen atom ( $d_{\mathrm{O-H}}$  = 2.314 Å) was found in the complex (Figure 1).

#### 2.3. OER Measurements

The diverse electrochemical characteristics of nickel allow us to assess the effectiveness of complex 1 in the electrochemical water oxidation reactions. Electrochemical experiments for the OER of complex 1–CC, designated as CC-1 (see details for working electrode preparation in the Experimental Section), were performed using a standard three-electrode setup in nitrogensaturated 1.0 m KOH solution. The three-electrode setup consisted of a Pt counter electrode, a Hg/HgO reference electrode, and a working electrode, known as CC-1. The measured potential (vs Hg/HgO, 1.0 m KOH) was converted to the potential versus the RHE using the Nernst equation;  $E_{\rm RHE} = E_{\rm Hg/HgO} + 0.059 \, {\rm pH} + E^{\circ}_{\rm Hg/HgO} \, [\rm pH \approx 14 \, for 1.0 \, m \, KOH, \, E^{\circ}_{\rm Hg/HgO} \, is 98 \, {\rm mV}$ , and  $E_{\rm Hg/HgO}$  is the experimentally measured potential]. [83,84]

The cyclic voltammetry (CV) response of the modified electrode CC-1 in 1.0 m KOH electrolyte was tested at a scan rate of 100 mV s<sup>-1</sup>, as shown in Figure 2a. Complex 1 displayed a quasireversible anodic activation wave corresponding to Ni(II)/Ni(III) at 1.34 V versus RHE, with  $\Delta E_{\rm Ni(II)/Ni(III)}$  of 70 mV.<sup>[44,52,85]</sup> However, the activation process reached completion, and the increased current density stabilized after  $\approx$ 100 CV cycles at a faster scan rate (100 mV s<sup>-1</sup>) (Figure S1a, Supporting Information). This trend suggests that, during the initial cycling, the catalyst undergoes an electrochemical activation process, transforming into a more catalytically active form. The observed increase in the current density over the initial cycles suggests the progressive formation of electroactive Ni-based redox centers, possibly involving partial oxidation to Ni<sup>3+</sup>/Ni<sup>4+</sup>. From cycles 90 to 100, the current density reached a plateau, indicating

that a steady-state active phase had been achieved, and that the electrode surface was fully conditioned (Figure S1b, Supporting Information). This activation of the modified electrode CC-1 ensured that the working electrode was in its optimal state for investigating the OER catalytic activity. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was performed at a scan rate of 5 mV s<sup>-1</sup> to analyze the polarization characteristics of the catalyst, and the results are shown in Figure 2b. The results observed from the LSV polarization curve exhibited a comparable characteristic peak associated with the Ni(II)/Ni(III) oxidation process, followed by the emergence of oxygen bubbles at the surface of the electrode, with the onset of the OER occurring at 1.48 V (Figure 2b). The potential required to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> (the standard for water-splitting reactions) was recorded at 1.56 V versus RHE (including 95% iR correction). [86,87] This implies that the LSV polarization curve of CC-1 (complex 1) delivers OER performance with an overpotential ( $\eta_{10}$ , V vs RHE) of 328 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. The OER polarization curves obtained from the bare **CC** and **CC-1** are shown in Figure 2b for comparison. Table 2 displays the OER overpotential (V vs RHE) at a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> for previously published nickel-based catalysts, indicating that the catalytic performance of the prepared electrode aligns closely with those of earlier documented catalysts.[47,52,60,88–92]

To investigate the intrinsic activity of complex 1, the electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) was determined and is illustrated in Figure 2e. The ECSA was calculated from the double layer capacitance double-layer capacitance ( $C_{\rm dl}$ ) at different scan rates of 30, 60, 90, 120, and 150 mV s<sup>-1</sup> using CV in the non-Faradaic regions of CC-1, 1.12–1.22 V versus RHE, with no catalytic current due to the OER (Figure S2a, Supporting Information). Taking into account the specific capacitance value of  $\approx$ 40 µF cm<sup>-2</sup> for a flat surface based on the actual surface area, the ECSA of the CC-1 was determined to be 0.2652 cm² (Figure 2e). [93–95] To calculate the ECSA of CC-1, a normalized curve was derived from the geometrical polarization LSV curve presented in Figure S2b (Supporting Information). To further elucidate the efficiency of the catalyst, the OER turnover frequency (TOF) of CC-1 was de-

termined. This assessment involved quantifying the number of active sites from the Ni(II)/Ni(III) redox peaks. The OER performance of Ni(II) complexes depends on the in situ generation of Ni(III) species within a 1.0 м KOH electrolyte. [96–98] A TOF of 4.87 s<sup>-1</sup> per Ni metal ion was calculated at 1.62 V versus RHE for complex 1. To assess the consistency and reliability of the measurements, Figure S3 (Supporting Information) illustrates a series of five measurements used in the TOF calculation. Differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) was also performed on CC-1 to identify the number of transferred electrons during the redox reaction (Figure S4, Supporting Information). The number of transferred electrons via the redox reaction was two in the case of complex 1. This indicates that only two of the four Ni<sup>2+</sup> ions in the system are active, leading to a two-electron reaction. [61,87] To gain insight into the OER kinetics, the Tafel slope for the CC-1 catalyst was derived from the iR-corrected polarization curve. As shown in Figure 2c, CC-1 exhibits a Tafel slope of 64 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>. Notably, the low Tafel slope of 64 mV dec<sup>-1</sup> indicates the fast OER kinetics observed in complex 1. The observed Tafel slope for complex 1 was particularly significant compared with those of the other catalysts. Noble metal oxides, such as IrO<sub>2</sub> and RuO<sub>2</sub>, exhibit Tafel slope values of  $\approx$ 30 and 50 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. Oxides and hydroxides of Fe, Co, and Ni in alkaline media exhibit Tafel slopes ranging from 60 to 120 mV  $dec^{-1}.^{\left[99-102\right]}$ 

To gain better insights into the electrode–electrolyte interface dynamics, we conducted an operando electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) study to measure the charge transfer kinetics at the electrode–electrolyte interface of **CC-1**. EIS studies indicated that the anodically activated **CC-1** exhibited a significantly smaller semicircle than the bare **CC**. We fitted the curve with a suitable circuit diagram to explore the various parameters involved. First, from the fitting of the Nyquist plot, the solution resistance is not significantly different (1.983  $\Omega$  for **CC-1** and 1.7865  $\Omega$  for bare carbon cloth), indicating that the test was performed in a similar type of solution resistance environment. Figure 2d shows that the  $R_{\rm ct}$  value for **CC-1** is 4.3895  $\Omega$ , which is considerably lower than the 17.834  $\Omega$  recorded for bare **CC**. This indicates the fast charge transfer kinetics between the

electrode and electrolyte solution and enhances the catalytic activity toward OER kinetics for CC-1. In addition to the Nyquist plot analysis, we explored the frequency-dependent behavior of the electrode. The Bode plot presented in Figure \$5 (Supporting Information) illustrates the phase angle ( $\theta^{\circ}$ ) as a function of frequency (Hz) for the nickel-oxygen cubane system during OER analysis. In the low-frequency region  $(10^{-1}-10^{1} \text{ Hz})$ , the phase angle decreased progressively with increasing applied potential, indicating a reduction in the capacitive contributions. This trend is further confirmed by the decline in the peak maxima within this frequency range, which is associated with the nonhomogeneous distribution caused by surface-oxidized species. Notably, the peak observed at 0.49 V suggests the onset of the OER. As the applied potential increased, the peak position in the Bode plot shifted accordingly. Furthermore, in the Nyquist plot analysis, the extracted equivalent resistance  $(R_1)$  exhibited a decreasing trend with increasing voltage, dropping from  $5.66 \times 10^5 \Omega$ cm<sup>2</sup> at 0.1 V to 2603  $\Omega$  cm<sup>2</sup> at 0.49 V, and further reducing to  $1.5382 \Omega \text{ cm}^2$  at 0.73 V. This substantial reduction in resistance facilitated the oxidation of the inner electrode. Between 0.10 and 0.49 V, the equivalent resistance dropped sharply to 0.49 V, likely due to the formation of intermediate species, which marks the initiation of the OER. Additionally, the variation in the phase angle from 0.49 to 0.73 V suggests modifications in the charge transfer kinetics, attributed to Ni-based active site transformations (Ni<sup>2+</sup>  $\rightarrow$  Ni<sup>3+</sup>/Ni<sup>4+</sup>), which are crucial for OER catalysis. The nickel-oxygen cubane system likely undergoes electronic structural changes during the OER, further influencing overall charge transfer resistance. In the mid-frequency region  $(10^1-10^2 \text{ Hz})$ , peaks appearing at 0.64 and 0.69 V indicate the formation of intermediate adsorption steps, such as OH<sup>-</sup> adsorption or Ni oxidation, preceding O<sub>2</sub> evolution. The shift in the phase angle in this region suggests active charge transfer (redox) processes at the electrode interface, corresponding to changes in the oxidation state of Ni under an applied potential. The peak shift toward higher frequencies implies a more pronounced phase shift, signifying the increased participation of Ni<sup>3+</sup> species in the OER process. At high frequencies (10<sup>2</sup>–10<sup>4</sup> Hz), a drastic phase angle change is observed beyond 0.49 V, eventually approaching toward zero, indicating that the system becomes more resistive in nature. This frequency range is primarily associated with oxidation processes occurring within the electrode. Although these analyses based on frequency provide essential insights into the electrode performance during the OER, it is equally vital to evaluate the durability of the catalyst over extended periods. The long-term stability of CC-1 was investigated using a chronoamperometric study at a constant potential of 1.56 V (vs RHE), which exhibited OER activity without losing its activity for 24 h (Figure 2f). Within the initial 4200 s period, a rise in current density was observed, indicating catalyst activation in response to the applied anodic potential. This activation process aligns with the trends observed in the CV cycling data, where the current density increased over the first  $\approx 100$  cycles. After  $\approx 4200$  s, the current reached a steady state, indicating that the active catalytic phase had formed and was stable under the operating conditions.

Previous studies have shown that in an alkaline medium during OER studies, certain molecular Ni complexes undergo complete transformation into NiO<sub>x</sub> derivatives by the complete degradation of Ni-metal complexes. The conversion of Ni complexes

to the catalytically active Ni(OH)2/Ni(O)OH form has been previously reported.[55,103-106] Additionally, there are instances supporting the partial transformation of molecular L-Ni(II) complexes into high-valent L-Ni(III)-OH species, where L represents a ligand. [52,61,107] Based on these findings, there are three possible active catalysts for our catalytic system: i) ligand free NiO, system, i.e., Ni(OH), or Ni(O)OH, ii) the interface of the molecular complex and in situ generated high-valent L-Ni(III)-OH/L-Ni(IV)-(O)OH, and iii) the molecular complex itself. To clarify the nature of the active catalyst in our system, we focused on key experimental observations, particularly the electrochemical behavior of the system. A key indicator of an intact coordination environment in Ni-based molecular complexes during the OER is the reversible nature of the precatalytic waves in the CV measurements. In our study, such features were clearly observed during the anodic sweep of complex 1 (Figure S6, Supporting Information), which is consistent with literature reports.[29,60,61] We calculated the area beneath the oxidation and reduction peaks to evaluate the charge associated with the redox activities, and a considerable retention of charge was noted between the forward and reverse scans (Figure S6, Supporting Information). Furthermore, the presence of crossover peaks in the cyclic voltammograms indicates the deterioration of molecular catalysts in an electrochemical cell, whereas their absence during CC-1 activation indicates robust ligand coordination around the Ni metal centers (Figure S7, Supporting Information). [29,108] This indicates that during the activation, the complex retains a relatively stable redox-active environment instead of immediately breaking down into completely amorphous NiO, derivatives.

An experiment was conducted to rule out the leaching of trace Ni-ion impurities during the OER performance: the CC-1 electrode was immersed in a 1 mм aqueous ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) solution, and the OER polarization curve was recorded in a fresh 1.0 м КОН electrolyte solution. Post-EDTA treatment, the OER performance of CC-1 remained unchanged (Figure 3a). Similar supporting evidence was provided by Kamboj and Metre in their study of [Ni<sub>22</sub><sup>II</sup>(dtbh-PLY)<sub>2</sub>] (dtbh-PLYH<sub>2</sub>: 9-(2-(3,6-di-tert-butyl-2hydroxybenzylidene)hydrazineyl)-1H-phenalen-1-one) to negate the impact of free Ni(II) ions on OER activity. [61]

In an alkaline environment, the OER activity of Ni-based electrocatalysts is typically promoted by Fe<sup>3+</sup> ion incorporation into Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>/NiOOH-type structures that can modulate the electronic structure of the active sites. [109–112] This incorporation typically results in a positive shift in the Ni(II)/Ni(III) redox wave along with an increase in current density, indicating improved catalytic activation and the formation of high-valent Ni<sup>3+</sup>-OH species, which are widely recognized as key intermediates in the OER pathway. [113–115] To validate the in situ formation of the active high valent L-Ni(III)-OH catalyst, we also introduced Fe(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub> (2 mm) to the electrolytic cell containing activated CC-1 in a 1.0 KOH solution. As shown in Figure 3b, the electrochemical response exhibited trends consistent with those reported in the literature, including an enhanced redox wave and improved OER performance, thereby supporting the formation of catalytically relevant Ni<sup>3+</sup>-OH sites upon Fe<sup>3+</sup> addition.

The stability and structural integrity of CC-1 after the catalytic cycles were confirmed using various spectroscopic analyses. All spectroscopic analyses were conducted 24 h after the

chronoamperometry experiments. Following the OER, the FTIR spectrum exhibited a prominent and extensively broad peak at 3350 cm<sup>-1</sup>. This significant absorption band corresponds to the vibrational stretching of the O-H groups in Ni(OH)2-based materials, which may overlap with the N-H or C-H stretching of the ligands. The development of Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>-based materials on the electrode surface after electrolysis in a 1.0 m potassium hydroxide solution was more evident than that on pristine complex 1. Additionally, the peaks observed at 1470, 1220, and 1010 cm<sup>-1</sup> confirm the presence of C=N, C-C, and C-O stretching, indicating the existence of aromatic rings and polyphenols, which aligns with the characteristics of the pristine Ni-complex 1. Moreover, the presence of broad and overlapping features in the 1000–1500 cm<sup>-1</sup> region can be attributed to the O–C=O symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations and the C-O stretching vibration modes. There is the possibility of strong physical adsorption of atmospheric H<sub>2</sub>O and CO<sub>2</sub> on the catalyst surface, suggesting the presence of hydroxyl groups in the precursor.[116] The band at fingerprint region is corresponding to the metal oxide vibration, which is due to the formation of Ni-O-H groups. The broad bond at 525 cm<sup>-1</sup> is a stretching vibration of (Ni-O-H).[117] It is pertinent to note that, as indicated by previous studies, crystalline and amorphous nickel oxide (NiO) nanoparticle materials exhibit a distinct and sharp absorption band in the range of 440–420 cm<sup>-1</sup>. This band corresponds to the stretching vibration of the Ni-O bond, serving as a reliable spectroscopic marker for Ni-based oxide phases<sup>[118,119]</sup>. However, in our postcatalysis FTIR spectrum, no such bands were detected below 500 cm<sup>-1</sup>, nor did we observe any characteristic peaks in the low-wavenumber region that could be attributed to Ni-O stretching. The absence of these characteristic vibrational signatures effectively precludes the formation of bulk NiO nanoparticles or a completely decomposed metal-oxide derivative of the molecular complex. The FTIR spectrum retained most of the distinctive characteristic peaks of complex 1 (Figure S8a, Supporting Information) after the reaction. Additionally, the UV-vis spectra recorded postelectrolysis confirmed that the fundamental properties of complex 1 in CC-1 remained unchanged after the OER (Figure S8b, Supporting Information).

To assess the morphology of **CC-1** and its distribution on the carbon cloth, we conducted FE-scanning electron microscope

(SEM) analysis before and after the experiment. As shown in Figure \$9 (Supporting Information), the morphology and material distribution remained mostly unaltered before and after the OER analysis, indicating the structural integrity of the material throughout the experiment. Additionally, elemental mapping studies confirmed the homogeneous distribution of Ni in both the pre- and post-OER samples. The elemental surface alterations of CC-1 during the OER after 24 h of chronoamperometry were investigated using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. To complement the chronoamperometry results and understand the surface evolution of the catalyst, XPS analysis was performed to provide important information about the transformations in the surface chemical components and their valence states throughout the OER experiments (Figure 4). The Ni2p spectrum before the OER (pristine complex 1) indicates (Figure 4a) the presence of Ni<sup>2+</sup> species as the peak appeared at  $\approx$ 855.6 eV (Ni 2p<sub>3/2</sub>) and  $\approx$ 873.10 (Ni 2p<sub>1/2</sub>) with their satellite peaks. The peak appeared at 855.45 eV for Ni<sup>2+</sup> species. The XPS results for CC-1 after the OER experiment (Figure 4b) revealed that the Ni 2p spectra could be deconvoluted into two spin-orbit doublets, each associated with characteristic shake-up satellite features. The high-resolution Ni 2p<sub>3/2</sub> and Ni 2p<sub>1/2</sub> spectra display well-resolved components corresponding to the two spin-orbit doublet characteristics of Ni<sup>2+</sup> and Ni<sup>3+</sup>. In the Ni 2p spectrum, the two strong peaks centered at binding energies of 854.6 and 872.3 eV are typically attributed to Ni<sup>2+</sup>, while the peaks observed at 856.0 and 874.6 eV are particularly characteristic of Ni<sup>3+</sup> ions.<sup>[120,121]</sup> Additionally, the satellite characteristics appearing at ≈861.1 and 879.3 eV correspond to shake-up peaks associated with Ni<sup>2+</sup>, located on the higher binding energy sides of the Ni  $2p_{3/2}$  and Ni  $2p_{1/2}$ . Following the OER process, the Ni 2pspectrum exhibited a pronounced peak at 856.4 eV, indicating the presence of NiOOH. The formation of NiOOH, along with residual Ni<sup>3+</sup>-OH, indicates the generation of mixed nickel hydroxide phases, which are widely recognized as active sites for enhanced oxygen evolution in alkaline media. The apparent Ni3+ peaks after the OER further supports the hypothesis that nickel undergoes oxidation to a higher valence state, thereby enhancing the catalytic efficiency. These findings are consistent with those of previous studies on Ni-based catalysts. [61,120-123] The O 1s spectra

provides further evidence of the catalytic activity of the oxygen species in the Ni─O cubane structure (Figure [4c,d\)](#page-8-0). Prior to the OER process, the primary peak at ≈531.24 eV was attributed to lattice oxygen (O2<sup>−</sup>) in the Ni─O bonds, while additional peaks at ≈535.55 eV corresponded to hydroxyl groups (─OH). After OER, a distinct peak shift occurred, with a higher-intensity peak emerging at ≈532.54 eV, which was associated with electrophilic oxygen species (O2 <sup>2</sup><sup>−</sup> or O<sup>−</sup>) or high-valent Ni3<sup>+</sup>─O species. Additionally, the post-OER spectrum shows an overall increase in the intensity of the peaks associated with surface ─OH groups and adsorbed oxygen, which is consistent with the formation of oxyhydroxide layers on the catalyst surface. Despite prolonged OER operation, the minimal shift in the nickel oxidation state suggests a high level of structural and chemical stability at the catalyst surface, which is a desirable characteristic for long-term electrochemical performance.

The N 1s spectrum reveals the influence of nitrogen coordination on stabilizing the Ni─O cubane structure (Figure [4e,f\)](#page-8-0). The N 1s spectrum before OER can be deconvoluted into three signals at BEs of ≈403.4, 399.36, and 397.98 eV, corresponding to C═N, C─N, and Ni<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup>─N, respectively. Thus, the presence of nitrogenfunctionalized species can improve electron transfer within the catalyst. After OER, there was a slight shift in the peak at ≈399.90 eV, which corresponds to nitrogen coordination due to the oxidation of the Ni<sup>3</sup><sup>+</sup>─N species. The presence of nitrogen coordination helps enhance the electronic structure of Ni, thereby promoting charge transfer and catalytic stability, as supported by previous studies.[\[122\]](#page-13-0)

Typically, the OER consists of multiple-step redox processes that include the adsorption and desorption of various species at the electrode surface, subsequently leading to metal-centered redox events.[\[96,123,124\]](#page-12-0) In general, the active nickel site of mononuclear Ni(II) complexes adsorbs an OH<sup>−</sup> ion from the electrolyte and then undergoes a one-electron Ni(II)/Ni(III) oxidation process, resulting in the formation of a high-valent Ni3<sup>+</sup>─OH species. Similarly, in multimetallic Ni(II) systems, more than one center may be activated, leading to the transfer of multiple electrons and the formation of similar high-valent active Ni<sup>3</sup><sup>+</sup>─OH species.[\[61,85,89\]](#page-12-0) The number of electrons transferred can be verified through DPV measurements. The DPV measurements in this study revealed that among the four Ni(II) centers in the complex, only two underwent oxidation, leading to the formation of Ni3<sup>+</sup>─OH active species (A) (**Figure 5**). To further probe the involvement of OH<sup>−</sup> ions in the activation process and evaluate the essentiality of Ni3<sup>+</sup>─OH formation, a complementary control experiment was performed in a CaCl2-saturated 1.0 m KOH solution. The Ca2<sup>+</sup> ions suppress the effective concentration of free OH<sup>−</sup> within the electrolyte as a result of the common ion effect, thus preventing the availability of OH<sup>−</sup> required for the redoxmediated activation of the Ni center. Under these conditions, the **CC-1** complex exhibited no trace of Ni(II)/Ni(III) redox transition, and hence, no OER activity was discernible (Figure S10,

Supporting Information). This unequivocally proves that free OH<sup>-</sup> ions are essential for creating catalytically active Ni<sup>3+</sup>—OH species and that catalyst activation is untenable without them. Additionally, the electrochemical transformation of complex 1 to activated form 1A occurred at ≈1.34 V, marking a key redox event in the catalytic cycle. This transformation is associated with the oxidation of Ni(II) centers and the establishment of Ni(III)-OH moieties on the catalyst surface. Postcatalysis XPS examination also revealed the presence of a high-valent Ni state in 1A, demonstrating direct spectroscopic evidence of it being the catalytically active phase (Figure 4).

## 3. Conclusion

Herein, we report a novel tetranuclear cubane-cored complex, [Ni<sub>4</sub>(LH)<sub>4</sub>(MeOH)]·CHCl<sub>3</sub> (1), supported by the LH<sub>3</sub> ligand. The immobilization of this complex on a carbon cloth surface generated CC-1, which exhibited electrochemical oxygen evolution activity in a 1 м KOH solution. The highly basic environment (pH  $\approx$ 14) specifically triggers two of the four Ni(II) centers in the complex, helping to initiate nickel-(oxy)hydroxy species that effectively promote the OER with an overpotential of 330 mV. Our detailed investigations revealed that the OER activity arises from the active sites at the molecular complex/Ni<sup>3+</sup>-OH interface, formed through the electrochemical activation of complex 1. XPS analysis further confirmed the in situ generation of [Ni<sup>3+</sup>—OH] species, identified as the key catalytic entities in the OER. The OER kinetics of complex 1 were remarkably fast, achieving a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> at an overpotential of 330 mV versus RHE, with a Tafel slope of 64 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>. Various spectroscopic analyses confirmed that the molecular integrity of complex 1 was preserved throughout the electrochemical operation. This study broadens the exploration of polynuclear transition metal complexes incorporating Schiff base ligands, highlighting their potential application in water splitting.

Preparation of CC-1: The conventional drop-casting method was used to prepare **CC** as an electrode for electrochemical OER studies. Initially, CC measuring 1 x 1 was cleaned using Millipore water and ultrasonication for a duration of 30 min. Later, 1 mL of a solution was made with ethanol, Nafion, and water in the following ratios: 7.5:0.5:2. This was performed to prepare the catalytic ink. Subsequently, the 34.5 µL sample was drop cast over the CC and allowed to dry for a predetermined amount of time (loading  $\approx$ 0.1 mg cm<sup>-2</sup>). The prepared **CC-1** electrode was dried and subsequently subjected to OER in an alkaline solution.

Electrochemical Measurements: The Corr Test potentiostat (Model Number: CS2350) was utilized for all electrochemical characterizations. Hg/HgO (1 M KOH) and Pt counter electrodes were used as reference electrodes purchased from Corrtest India. In this study, all potentials were calibrated against the RHE using the equation provided below. Furthermore, LSV measurements were performed with 95% iR compensation. The conversion to RHE was achieved using the following equation

$$E_{RHE} = E_{ref} + 14 \times 0.059 + 0.098 \tag{1}$$

All the data were presented with iR-compensation according to the following equation

$$E ext{ (iR - corrected)} = E ext{ (actual)} - R_s \times i [R_s = Resistance of solution]$$
 (2)

Overpotential ( $\eta$ ) value CC-1 to attain current density of 10 mA cm $^{-2}$ was calculated by the following equation:  $\eta$  (OER) = ( $E_{\rm obs}$  – 1.23) V versus

The Tafel equation was fitted to match  $\eta$  versus log (current density) after determining the Tafel slope from the data of LSV polarization curve (by assuming identical concentration in bulk and at the electrode-electrolyte interface)

$$\eta = \beta \cdot \log(j/j_0) \tag{3}$$

where " $\beta$ " signifies the Tafel slope value, "j" implies the current density value, and " $j_0$ " is the exchange current density.

EIS measurements were performed in the frequency range of 105-0.1 Hz at 0.75 V versus Hg/HgO. From the Nyquist plot, one circuit was fitted to obtain the value of  $R_{\rm ct}$ . Also. The ECSA value could be calculated by evaluating the  $C_{\rm dl}$ , as follows

$$\Delta j = \nu \times C_{dl} \tag{4}$$

$$ECSA = C_{dl}/C_{s}$$
 (5)

 $C_c$  is the specific capacitance value (0.040 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>), [125] and  $\Delta i$  is the current in double-layer capacitance obtained from the scan rates ( $\nu$ ) in the non-Faradic potential region.

Instrumentation: A PerkinElmer Spectrum Two FTIR Spectrometer in the range of 450-4500 cm<sup>-1</sup> was used to record the IR data using a Diamond ATR module. LMSPUV1920 UV-vis. A Double Beam Spectrophotometer was used for UV-vis analysis. spectrum. A Thermoquest CE instrument CHNS-O, EA/110 model was used to perform the elemental analyses. At ambient temperature, the crystal data of the complex were obtained using a Bruker D8 Quest diffractometer. The device employed a MoK $\alpha$  X-ray source with a graphite monochromator ( $\lambda = 0.71073$  Å), functioning at 50 kV and 1 mA. X-ray data acquisition was managed using the APEX3 software platform. [126] The SAINT and SADABS programs were used to correct the data for Lorentz-polarization and absorption effects. The structural determinations were accomplished using direct methods, followed by refinement with full-matrix least squares in SHELXL,

XPS analysis was recorded with Omicron ESCA (Oxford Instruments, Germany) instruments. FE-SEM (JEOL JSM 7100F) with an accelerating voltage of 5–15 kV with 10 μA of emission current. For the OER investigations, a solution of 1.0 m KOH was utilized, prepared using Millipore ultrapure water characterized by a resistivity of 18.2 MΩ cm when measured at 25 °C. Controlled electrochemical experiments were conducted using a Corr Test potentiostat (Model Number: CS2350) under an oxygen-free atmosphere. Prior to all experiments, the aqueous electrolytic solution was degassed by purging with nitrogen gas for at least 30 min. All electrochemical measurements were subsequently corrected for iR losses, which arose from the solution resistance, except where explicitly noted otherwise.

**To improve the efficiency of water electrolysis, developing efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysis is extremely important due to its four-electron transfer dynamics. In this work, a π-conjugated molecule (2,3,6,7,10,11-hexahydroxytriphenylene, HHTP), which can accelerate the electron transfer, is coated directly on pristine ZIF-67, resulting in a composite named HHTP@ZIF-67, via a simple one-step solvothermal method. The obtained HHTP@ZIF-67 possesses a Brunauer–Emmett–Teller surface area of 2013.9 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> and displays microporous behavior, which can provide enough active sites for OER. The double-layer capacitance of HHTP@ZIF-67 is also enhanced, corresponding to an enlarged electrochemical active surface area. HHTP@ZIF-67 presents a quite low overpotential of 238 mV at 10 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> in 1.0 m KOH. This material synthesized via the simple coating strategy is promising in the application of energy conversion devices.**

Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) plays a predominant role in energy storage and conversion involving electrochemistry.[1–3] Due to the four-electron transfer mechanism, OER suffers from rationally sluggish reaction kinetics, leading to poor efficiency of water electrolysis.[4] Therefore, exploring highly efficient OER electrocatalyst is urgently required to fulfill the demand of clean and sustainable energy.

Currently, well-established electrocatalysts are mainly Ir- and Ru-based materials with marvelous performance.[5–8] However, the scarcity and high price severely inhibit their widespread application in electrocatalysis. Earth-abundant elements catch researchers' eyes that can be developed as low-cost and highefficient electrocatalysts, such as Co,[9–11] Ni,[12,13] and Fe.[14–16]

Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), as a new type of promising materials in electrochemistry, are well investigated by researchers in recent years.[17–20] Due to the poor conductivity of MOFs, strategies are developed to increase the conductivity and improve the electrochemical performance, such as doping different elements (both metals and nonmetals),[21,22] incorporating conductive materials (such as graphene),[23,24] encapsulating active molecules,[25,26] and even undergoing calcination[27,28] or pyrolysis.[29–31]

Zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs),[32,33] as a new subfamily of MOFs, exhibit not only crystalline multiporosity as MOFs but also high thermal and chemical stability as zeolites. Attributed to the outstanding properties, ZIF derivatives are unique potential candi-

dates in diversified applications such as chemical separation,[34,35] sensors,[36–38] energy storage,[39,40] and catalysis.[41,42] π-Conjugated molecules are used to construct planar conductive MOFs in recent years due to the high charge mobility and the corresponding MOFs are explored as good electrocatalysts,[43] electrode materials,[44] sensors,[45] and so on. In our study, a simple MOF architecture, named ZIF-67, was used as the raw material to prepare a high-performance catalyst for OER. The organic molecule HHTP (2,3,6,7,10,11-hexahydroxytriphenylene) was coated on ZIF-67 via a facile one-step hydrothermal method and the obtained composite, denoted as HHTP@ZIF-67, presented higher electrocatalytic efficiency and durability than many reported MOF materials. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a π-conjugated molecule was coated directly on MOFs to ameliorate their electrochemical capabilities. This work will shed light on the further application of MOFs as promising electrocatalysts in energy storage and conversion.

ZIF-67 was synthesized according to the previous work by Dong and co-workers[46] and utilized to prepare our porous electrocatalysts. The composite HHTP@ZIF-67 was successfully obtained after combining ZIF-67 together with HHTP under different solvothermal conditions (40, 60, 80, and 100 °C). The synthesis route is presented in **Scheme 1**. Since the as-prepared sample under 60 °C manifests the most uniform in both size and surface morphology that can be visualized in Figure S1 (Supporting Information), the following characterizations and discussions are focused on HHTP@ZIF-67 obtained under 60 °C when comparing with the pristine ZIF-67.

**Scheme 1.** The two-step synthetic route of the composite HHTP@ZIF-67 via solvothermal conditions.

The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of HHTP@ZIF-67 and ZIF-67 are presented in Figure S2 (Supporting Information). The two materials present the similar crystalline structure that is consistent with the simulated structure. In addition, no more phases can be observed, denoting that HHTP@ZIF-67 preserves the multiporous architecture of ZIF-67 after coating the π-conjugated molecules. Comparing the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of HHTP@ZIF-67 and ZIF-67 (**Figure 1**a,b), we can see the microstructure of HHTP@ZIF-67 retains the dodecahedral topological structure of pristine ZIF-67, but apparently displays much rougher surface than ZIF-67. It can be deduced that HHTP was successfully coated on the pure ZIF-67, along with a surface morphology change in the microstructure. The above presumption can also be demonstrated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements (Figure 1c,d).

Figure S3 (Supporting Information) shows the Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of both pristine ZIF-67 and the as-prepared HHTP@ZIF-67. The newly arising sharp peak at 1672 cm<sup>−</sup>1 in HHTP@ZIF-67 is ascribed to the stretching vibration of ν(CC) from the aromatic backbone. The vibrational bands at 1090 and 1050 cm<sup>−</sup>1 can be attributed to the stretching vibration of ν(CO) from HHTP backbone. The above two groups of characteristic vibrational bands further confirm the successful coating HHTP on pristine ZIF-67. We also presented the FTIR spectrum of HHTP@ZIF-67 after OER catalysis, which can demonstrate the firm attachment of HHTP molecule on the composite.

The energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mapping analysis indicated the evidence of Co, O, N, and C in HHTP@ZIF-67 (Figure 1e). Furthermore,

to confirm the surface composition and explore the chemical state of the obtained materials, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements of HHTP@ZIF-67 and ZIF-67 were carried out (**Figure 2**a). The XPS survey spectra unambiguously indicate the evidence of Co, O, N, and C in both HHTP@ZIF-67 and ZIF-67 samples, which is consistent with the EDS elemental mapping result. The significant increase of O species and the considerable decrease of N species in HHTP@ZIF-67, compared with the pristine ZIF-67, indicated that HHTP was coated on ZIF-67 effectively. From the XPS spectra of C 1s in Figure 2b, a new peak at 287.38 eV was observed for CO bond in the HHTP backbone, further demonstrating the successful HHTP coating on ZIF-67. The third binding energy peak appeared in the O 1s XPS spectra continually confirmed this simple coating strategy (Figure 2c).

In the high-resolution XPS spectra of Co 2p (Figure 2d), both signals from the two samples were split into 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 doublets due to the spin–orbit coupling.[47–49] Two states of Co species were detected from the deconvoluted Co 2p corelevel spectra. In the sample of pristine ZIF-67, Co 2p can be deconvoluted into two pairs of spin–orbit doublets around 798.50/782.85 and 796.67/781.06 eV, corresponding to Co2<sup>+</sup> and Co<sup>3</sup>+, respectively, along with their satellite peaks on

the high binding energy side. The characteristic fitting peaks at 798.64 and 783.09 eV are ascribed to Co2<sup>+</sup> while the peaks at 796.64 and 781.01 eV correspond to Co3<sup>+</sup> in the sample of HHTP@ZIF-67 composite. The other two sets of peaks are satellite peaks. What's more, peak fitting analysis of Co 2p manifested a considerable variation in the relative ratio of Co<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> and Co3<sup>+</sup>. In ZIF-67, the proportions of Co2<sup>+</sup> and Co3<sup>+</sup> are nearly the same while the ratio of Co3<sup>+</sup> is almost two times larger than that of Co2<sup>+</sup> in HHTP@ZIF-67. The largely increased intensity of Co3<sup>+</sup> species in HHTP@ZIF-67 composites indicates a remarkable electrochemical performance since Co3<sup>+</sup> cation has been regarded as the catalytically active centers for OER.[50–54]

To investigate the OER catalytic activity of HHTP@ZIF-67 composite, linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was conducted on a glass carbon electrode in a standard three-electrode system in N2-saturated 1.0 m KOH electrolyte. For comparison, the OER performances of commercial RuO2, pristine ZIF-67, and HHTP@ZIF-67 composites synthesized at different temperatures were also measured under the same conditions. The anodic polarization curves obtained by LSV at a slow scan rate of 5 mV s−<sup>1</sup> are presented in **Figure 3**a and Figure S5 (Supporting Information). As well known, the operating potential of materials to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm−<sup>2</sup> is taken as the indicator to estimate their electrocatalytic performances. In view of the results, the operating potential of HHTP@ZIF-67 denoted at 1.468 V versus RHE to drive a current density of 10 mA cm−<sup>2</sup> , corresponds to an overpotential of 238 mV. In comparison with pristine ZIF-67 and commercial RuO2, the overpotential of which are 401 and 375 mV, respectively, HHTP@ZIF-67 composite indicates the most outstanding OER activity. In spite of the low overpotential, the durability of electrocatalyst is also a quite pivotal factor for practical applications. HHTP@ZIF-67 presented only a slight decay after 1000 cycles in 1 m KOH (Figure S6, Supporting Information), confirming its excellent stability toward OER. The *i*–*t* curve of the electrolyzer from HHTP@ZIF-67 displays a slight degradation of current density after a long period of test, further demonstrating the superior stability of the obtained material (Figure S7, Supporting Information). The high OER performance of the HHTP@ZIF-67 electrode displays promising applications in contrast with other catalysts of MOF composites (Table S1, Supporting Information).

To gain further insights into the OER catalytic kinetics of the abovementioned catalysts, Tafel plots of different samples were profiled according to the polarization curves (Figure 3b). It is established that the lower Tafel slope denotes faster enhancement of OER rate with the potential increase. The Tafel slope of HHTP@ZIF-67 composite is 104 mV dec<sup>−</sup>1, which is apparently smaller than those of pure ZIF-67 and RuO2. It verifies that HHTP@ZIF-67 composite possesses the highest intrinsic OER catalytic kinetics. The low overpotential and small Tafel slope demonstrate that HHTP@ZIF-67 displays high activity toward OER. Additionally, the intrinsic OER activities of all samples are assessed by turnover frequency (TOF) as well, assuming all the metals in the material are participated in OER catalysis. Taking the overpotential of 300 mV as an example,[31]

the TOF values for HHTP@ZIF-67, pristine ZIF-67, and RuO2 are 0.021, 0.00156, and 0.00212 s−<sup>1</sup> , respectively. The TOF results once again manifest that HHTP@ZIF-67 composite possesses the most excellent OER activity.

Electrical conductivity, which is in line with the electrontransfer process, also plays an important role in the OER catalytic activity. The higher the electrical conductivity is, the smaller the Schottky barriers at both catalyst–electrode and catalyst–electrolyte interfaces would be.[55] To explore the electron transport ability of HHTP@ZIF-67 composite, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were conducted with a glass carbon electrode. The diameter of semicircles accords with the charge transfer resistance (*R*ct) in the Nyquist plot. In view of the results in Figure 3c, the HHTP@ZIF-67 composite displays a much smaller *R*ct (64.04 Ω) compared to the pristine ZIF-67 (334.47 Ω), revealing an elevated electrical conductivity that leads to a more efficient electrochemical OER performance.

In addition, cyclic voltammetry (CV) was conducted to investigate the valence state of cobalt species in HHTP@ZIF-67 composite. Depicted in Figure S8 (Supporting Information), the typical redox peaks appeared in both HHTP@ZIF-67 and ZIF-67, which could be ascribed to the redox progress between Co2+ and Co3+. We did not find any other new redox peaks in the HHTP@ZIF-67 sample, illustrating that cobalt species mainly exist in the form of Co<sup>2</sup>+. [56] Furthermore, both the oxidation and reduction potentials of HHTP@ZIF-67 positively shift a little, indicating the electron transfer aroused by the coating of HHTP. The electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) plays a significant role in the OER catalytic ability, while the double-layer capacitance (*C*dl) is proportional to the ECSA of catalysts. Therefore, *C*dl of HHTP@ZIF-67 and ZIF-67 were measured via cyclic voltammetry at different scan rates in the non-faradaic region,[57,58] in which no redox progress would occur. As presented in Figure S9 (Supporting Information), the *C*dl value of HHTP@ZIF-67 is 56.43 mF cm<sup>−</sup>2, nearly one time larger than that of pure ZIF-67 (32.08 mF cm<sup>−</sup>2). It illustrates that HHTP@ZIF-67 composite possesses an increased catalytic surface area, yielding an improved OER catalysis performance.

The last but not the least, N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms were carried out and denoted a typical type-I curve of the obtained HHTP@ZIF-67 material along with a highly steep N2 uptake in the low relative pressure range (Figure 3d). According to the profiled plots, the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) specific surface area of HHTP@ZIF-67 composite is calculated as 2013.9 m<sup>2</sup> g−<sup>1</sup> , which is larger than the pristine ZIF-67 reported.[59] Furthermore, the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) size distribution (inset in Figure 3d) points out that the majority pores in HHTP@ZIF-67 are about 1.85 nm. In **www.advancedsciencenews.com**

**www.small-journal.com**

view of the above results, the obtained HHTP@ZIF-67 possesses high specific surface area as well as abundant porosity, yielding an increased electron transfer process, which endows HHTP@ZIF-67 promising applications in the electrocatalytic OER field.

The postulated mechanism of OER in alkali environment is revealed in Equations (1)–(5), where AS represents the electrochemically active site on the surface of materials. In the viewpoint of OER mechanism, a four-electron progress is determined during the reaction. It is easy to find that the electron transportation is pivotal in the catalysis procedure. In our work, a π-conjugated molecule HHTP is appointed as the coating layer on the pristine ZIF-67, which can extensively enhance the electron movement from anode to cathode. Under the synergistic effect of π-conjugated skeleton and multiporous architecture of ZIF-67, the as-synthesized material of HHTP@ZIF-67 demonstrated highly improved electrochemical catalytic performance as well as better long-term durability compared to the pristine ZIF-67

$$AS + OH^{-} = AS - OH + e^{-}$$

$$\tag{1}$$

$$AS - OH + OH^{-} = AS - O + H_{2}O + e^{-}$$
 (2)

$$AS - O + OH^{-} = AS - OOH + e^{-}$$
(3)

$$AS - OOH + OH^{-} = AS + H_{2}O + O_{2} + e^{-}$$
 (4)

Overall: 
$$4OH^{-} = 2H_2O + O_2 + 4e^{-}$$
 (5)

In summary, we successfully coated a molecule with π-orbital conjugation on the pristine ZIF-67 via a simple onestep hydrothermal method, yielding a superior OER electrocatalyst. The drawback of MOFs is their poor electroconductivity, which results in deficient performances in electrocatalysis. In our work, taking advantage of the π-conjugated structure, which can lead to a high-speed electron transfer, realized the improvement of OER performance. Comparing with the pure ZIF-67, the composite of HHTP@ZIF-67 presented a much smaller charge transfer resistance, a superb lower overpotential at the current density of 10 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2 as well as better durability. Combining the permanent porosity and good thermal stability of ZIF architecture with the fast electron transfer of the π-conjugated aromatic ring, the obtained HHTP@ZIF-67 manifested an improved electrocatalytic OER ability. As far as we know, this is the first example of coating π-conjugated molecules directly on pristine MOFs to ameliorate the electrocatalytic performance. We believe this facile strategy would pave a novel way to the synthesis of efficient electrocatalysis and promote their applications in energy storage and conversion devices.

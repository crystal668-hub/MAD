# Fe-Alloyed MoNi Nanohybrids as Oxygen Evolution Reaction/Oxygen Reduction Reaction Bifunctional Electrocatalyst for Rechargeable Zinc-Air Batteries

Linlin Dang, Kai Zhang, Qiguan Wang,\* Changhua Xu, and Sumin Wang\*

Active bifunctional electrocatalysts for both oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) are badly required for high-efficiency zinc–air batteries (ZABs). Herein, a Fe-alloyed MoNi nanohybrid (MoNiFe) as bifunctional catalyst is reported. The alloyed MoNiFe architecture with the decreased size compared with MoNi is obtained by a hydrothermal reduction method, which enhances the exposed active sites and promotes the charge transfer. Accordingly, MoNiFe exhibits good bifunctionality, with a positive half-wave potential (0.896 V) near Pt/C (0.812 V) in ORR reaction and a low overpotential (0.295 V) similar to IrO<sub>2</sub> (0.29 V) in OER process. The as-derived rechargeable ZAB cells based on the bifunctional MoNiFe catalyst show the peak power density of 58 mW cm<sup>-2</sup> with a high open-circuit voltage of 1.319 V. Thus, this work paves a new alloying avenue for synthesizing effective bifunctional electocatalysts for ZABs.

#### 1. Introduction

The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is regarded as an indispensable process in energy conversion/storage devices, such as fuel cells, water splitting, and zinc–air batteries (ZABs).  $^{[1-3]}$  However, the OER efficiency is severely impeded by the high overpotential because of the intrinsically slow kinetics.  $^{[4-6]}$  The noble Ir/Rubased metals show excellent OER activity,  $^{[7-9]}$  but their high cost and low cycled stability have been the key drawbacks limiting their industrial applications. Therefore, development of effective non-noble metal-based catalysts that can replace the precious metal catalysts is now demanded. Recently, the nonprecious transition metals (e.g., Ni, Co, and Fe) with active d-orbital electrons that can lower the activation energies in many catalytic processes are considered as the promising candidates in OER electrocatalysts and have caught a lot of attention.  $^{[10-14]}$ 

It is public knowledge that the accompanied hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) also affects the OER kinetics in the water splitting.<sup>[15]</sup> Among the transition metals, the nonprecious nickel-based alloys have shown attractive HER performances

in water electrolysis.[16,17] In addition, it is reported that introduction of Mo atoms in the active Ni centers can enhance the hydrogen adsorption on catalysts.[18-20] Consequently, the Ni-Mo alloys exhibited a high catalytic activity.<sup>[21]</sup> For example, the MoNi<sub>4</sub> nanoalloy covered by MoO<sub>2</sub> nanosheets on carbon cloth displayed high catalytic activity, with the overpotential of 253 and 23 mV at  $10 \,\mathrm{mA \, cm^{-2}}$ , corresponding to a low Tafel slope of 136 and 47 mV dec<sup>-1</sup> for OER and HER, respectively, caused by the enhanced conductivity and increased exposed active sites.[22] Moreover, by the design of pore orientation, the porous NiMo alloys present higher electrocatalytic activity with the Tafel slope of 117 and 94 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>, respectively, for

OER and HER. <sup>[23]</sup> Meanwhile, the main challenges in replacing noble metal electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution in alkaline conditions are also related to their stability and kinetics. It has been shown that a 3D porous MoNi<sub>4</sub> network heat-treated at 450 °C requires only  $\pm 1.58\,\mathrm{V}$  to achieve a total water crack of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, and delivers good stability and no activity loss over 24 h. <sup>[24]</sup> The MoNi alloy clusters formed through bulk reconstruction were reported to keep activity for more than 100 h at the overpotential of 190 mV, and water crack for more than 200 h. <sup>[25]</sup> However, as a potential bifunctional catalyst in ZABs, the oxygen reduction (ORR) performance of NiMo nanoalloy is another important parameter that should be considered, while it is now rarely studied.

In fact, the partial charge transfer activated by alloying of Ni and Fe also acts as a catalytic promoter by influencing the activated potential of Ni<sup>2+</sup>/Ni<sup>3+</sup> couples.<sup>[26,27]</sup> It is reported that a synergistic active effect of Fe alloyed with other transition metals can occur and boost the OER catalytic activity of the materials.<sup>[28–30]</sup> More importantly, the Fe 3d delocalization could be enhanced by FeNi alloying, resulting in remarkable bifunctional ORR/OER activity, with a narrow potential difference of 0.691 V.[31] Based on the abovementioned activation effect from the Fe alloying, in this work, a Fe-alloyed MoNi hybrid as bifunctional catalyst was prepared (Figure 1). The alloying of Fe in MoNi leads to size-decreased MoNiFe compared with MoNi, which provides enhanced exposed active sites, and exhibits an excellent half-wave potential (0.896 V) for ORR and overpotential (0.295 V) for OER @10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, showing a good application prospect in the fabrication of ZABs.

### 2. Result and Discussion

#### 2.1. Physical Characterization

As shown in Figure 1, the Fe-alloyed MoNi hybrid as bifunctional catalyst was prepared from a hydrothermal reduction route. To survey the crystalline information of the prepared MoNiFe nanohybrids, the XRD analysis was performed. The characteristic peaks located at  $2\theta = 44.3^{\circ}$ , 52.1°, and 76.8° in Figure 2a can be attributed to planes (240), (151), and (172) of MoNi, respectively. [32–35] After further alloying by Fe, the diffraction peak located at  $2\theta = 40.5^{\circ}$  assigned to (410) facet of FeMo appeared (PDF#15-0539),[36] and the diffraction peaks located at  $2\theta = 44.2^{\circ}$ , 51.5°, and 75.8° assigned to (111), (200), and (220) facet of FeNi alloys were also found (PDF#38-0419), respectively. [37] The results showed that both Mo and Ni were well alloyed with Fe to form the MoNiFe nanohybrids. The porous properties of the freshly prepared catalysts were evaluated by the N2 adsorption/ desorption isotherms, as displayed in Figure 2b,c. Both samples delivered the type-IV adsorption-desorption isotherms. In addition, after alloyed with Fe, the BET surface area of MoNi was increased from 84 to 131 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup> (Figure 2b), owing to the possible size reduction and the increase of new generated interfaces. Moreover, MoNiFe nanohybrids possessed a relatively narrower pore size distribution than MoNi, calculated by the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method (Figure 2c).

Subsequently, XPS analyses were managed to probe the chemical compositions and bonding information of the MoNiFe (Figure 2d-f and S1a,b, Supporting Information) and MoNi (Figure S1c-f, Supporting Information). The XPS survey curve in Figure S1a, Supporting Information, confirms the existence of Mo, Ni, and Fe elements in the MoNiFe nanohybrids. As illustrated in Figure S1b, Supporting Information, from the survey spectrum, the atomic contents of Mo, Ni, and Fe in MoNiFe are calculated to be 55%, 27%, and 18%, respectively, which is roughly the same as the feeding ratio in the experimental scheme. Figure 2d-f shows peak fitting results of Ni, Mo, and Fe. There are two peaks located at 855.8 and 873.5 eV, with two satellite peaks located at 861.7 and 879.9 eV in the Ni 2p spectrum. The former is attributed to Ni  $2p_{3/2}$  of Ni<sup>2+</sup>, and the latter is assigned to Ni  $2p_{1/2}$  of Ni<sup>2+</sup> (Figure 2d). The fitted peak of Ni<sup>0</sup> (852.8 eV) in MoNiFe nanohybrids has an increased binding energy compared to the standard Ni<sup>o</sup> fitted peak (852.5 eV), which reflects the electron transfer during alloying. [38] Figure 2e illustrates the Mo 3d spectra, in which four peaks at 232.4, 233.9, 231.5, and 235.4 eV are found. The peaks at 232.4 and 235.4 eV are corresponded to Mo  $3d_{5/2}$  of Mo<sup>6+</sup>, and the peak at 233.9 eV is attributed to Mo  $3d_{3/2}$  of Mo<sup>4+</sup>.[38] The peak allocated at 231.5 eV is assigned to  $3d_{5/2}$  of Mo<sup>0</sup>. Figure 2f shows the Fe 2pspectrum of MoNiFe, which is fitted into two peaks at 724.8 and 712.3 eV, corresponding to Fe<sup>3+</sup>  $2p_{1/2}$  and Fe<sup>2+</sup>  $2p_{3/2}$ , respectively. [28] The charged metal elements indicate the existed

electron transfer during Fe alloying with MoNi, which is beneficial to the enhancement of catalytic activities.

The morphological change of the MoNi catalysts before and after Fe alloying was investigated by SEM and TEM. As shown in **Figure 3**a,c, the MoNi alloy displays a large regular microsphere with size of about 3  $\mu$ m. The further alloying with Fe makes the size of MoNi catalyst greatly decreased, reaching nanoscale (Figure 3b,d). This nanoscale structure will provide abundant active centers, which are more conducive to electrolyte absorption and penetrating, thereby improving the catalytic activity. In addition, the EDS of MoNiFe (Figure S2, Supporting Information) shows that Mo, Ni, and Fe have the relative contents: 51%, 28%, and 20%, respectively, which are consistent with the XPS results. Figure 3e,f shows the HR-TEM

images of MoNi and MoNiFe, respectively. In insets of Figure 3e, the lattice fringes with d=0.204 correspond to the crystal plane (240) of bimetallic MoNi compound, and the concentric rings attributing to (151) and (240) of MoNi are observed. As shown in insets of Figure 3f, there appear two different lattice fringes of the (200) crystal plane (d=0.177) for alloyed FeNi and the (410) crystal plane (d=0.233) for alloyed FeMo, with the corresponding concentric rings in the diffraction pattern. Above analysis is consistent with the XRD results, as shown in Figure 2a. In addition, the elemental mapping images of MoNiFe in Figure 3g–i illustrate that the Mo, Ni, and Fe are uniformly distributed in the samples. These results all support that the Fe was well alloyed with Mo and Ni in MoNiFe catalysts.

#### 2.2. Electrochemical Characterization

The potential of the redox peak and the area of the CV curve reflect the catalytic ability of the electrocatalyst. As exhibited in **Figure 4**a, the CV curves of the MoNiFe catalyst at 50 mV s<sup>-1</sup> showed two pairs of redox peaks located at 1.384/1.341 and 1.447/1.429 V, respectively, while MoNi has only one pair of redox peaks (1.466/1.360 V), [39] indicating that catalytic activity of MoNi is enhanced by alloying through Fe.

Figure S3, Supporting Information, illustrates the CV plots of MoNi and MoNiFe catalysts in the non-Faradaic voltage window at scan rates of 20-100 mV s<sup>-1</sup>. The current density versus scan rate fitted linear regression allows estimation of the double layer capacitance  $(C_{DL})$ , as presented in Figure 4b. It is known that catalysts with more active sites should have larger  $C_{DI}$  values.<sup>[40]</sup> The results show that the  $C_{DL}$  of MoNi and MoNiFe nanohybrids are 2.8 and 0.115 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>, respectively. Furthermore, the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) can be determined by double-layer capacitance method. [40,41] Figure S4, Supporting Information, shows that MoNiFe nanohybrids have a much higher ECSA (70 cm<sup>2</sup>) than MoNi (2.875 cm<sup>2</sup>). Based on the high ECSA, it is indicated that more active sites are formed on MoNiFe nanohybrids under the alloying effect, which can promote the electrocatalytic activity.

The OER properties of MoNi and MoNiFe were tested in 1M KOH aqueous solution by electrochemical experiments. As shown in Figure 4c, at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, the MoNiFe almost showed the nearly same overpotential of 0.295 V as IrO2 (0.29 V), much lower than MoNi (0.357 V). The Tafel slopes of MoNi, MoNiFe, and IrO2 are 109.5, 65.2, and 42.3 mV decade<sup>-1</sup>, respectively (Figure 4d), and MoNiFe exhibits the reaction rate close to IrO2, which indicates that OER reaction kinetics of MoNi was improved by alloying with Fe. Electrochemical stability is also an important evaluation for the OER performance of catalysts. Figure 4e,f shows the slightly fluctuating i-t curve of MoNiFe at 1.53 V and the similar LSV curves before and after 1000 CV cycles, respectively, indicating that the MoNiFe catalyst has good stability and durability.

Meanwhile, the ORR performance of the MoNiFe catalysts was tested. Figure 5a shows that the MoNiFe nanohybrids have higher response to oxygen than MoNi from the larger current density in oxygen-saturated electrolyte. The LSV curves of MoNi, MoNiFe, and Pt/C catalysts were measured under the condition of O<sub>2</sub> saturation at 1,600 rpm (Figure 5b), and MoNiFe nanohybrids illustrated the larger limiting current density  $(-3.164 \,\mathrm{mA \, cm^{-2}})$  than the MoNi  $(-1.362 \,\mathrm{mA \, cm^{-2}})$ , with the more positive half-wave potential (0.896 V) than MoNi (0.818 V). In Figure 5c, the Tafel slopes of MoNi, MoNiFe, and Pt/C are 93.7, 46.8, and 78.2 mV decade<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. It also showed the ORR kinetics of MoNi could be improved by alloying with Fe. Figure 5d shows the electrochemical impedance spectrum (EIS) of MoNi and MoNiFe. The arc observed in the high-frequency region of the curve stands for the Faradaic charge transfer resistance of the electrode. [42] The angle between the curve in the intermediate frequency region and the real axis is the characteristic of ions diffusion to the electrode. [43] Therefore, according to the semicircle diameter (MoNiFe < MoNi) in the high frequency region of Figure 5d, the electrochemical

**4DVANCED** 

resistance of MoNiFe nanohybrids is smaller than that of MoNi, due to the enhancement of the electrical conductivity<sup>[44]</sup> resulted from the further alloving of Fe element in the MoNi catalyst. As can be seen from the straight line in the low-frequency region, the slope of MoNiFe is much higher than that of MoNi, indicating that the ion diffusion impedance in the electrolyte is greatly decreased by alloying with Fe.

To further study the ORR catalytic mechanism of the MoNiFe catalyst, LSVs of MoNiFe nanohybrids rotated at different speeds were measured, as shown in Figure 6a. The K-L curves at different voltages were fitted<sup>[45]</sup> (Figure 6b), and the average number of electron transfer per molecule of oxygen reduction in the catalytic ORR process of MoNiFe nanohybrids was calculated to be 2.0 in 0.4-0.6 V. Meanwhile, as shown in Figure 6c,d, through the RRDE experiment, we obtained the results consistent with the RDE experiment. Under 0.4-0.6 V, the MoNiFe nanohybrids show catalyzed ORR reaction according to the 2e- process, and the hydrogen peroxide yield is around 80%.

The electrochemical stability of the catalytic ORR reaction is measured by the i-t curve, as presented in Figure 6e,f. It can be found that the current density of MoNiFe nanohybrids (27%) decreases slightly with the increase of test time and Pt/C (56%) dropped significantly; in addition, the LSV curve of MoNiFe before and after 1,000 CV cycles does not change much, both indicating that it has good ORR stability and durability.

#### 2.3. ZABs

Considering the high catalytic performance of MoNiFe nanohybrids for ORR and OER, a rechargeable ZAB device was assembled by using MoNiFe as the air cathode. As shown in **Figure 7a**,g, the open-circuit voltage of MoNiFe-based ZAB is 1.319 and 1.372 V for  $Pt/C + IrO_2$ -based ZAB. From

Figure 7b,c, the discharge power density of MoNiFe-based ZAB reaches 58 mW cm $^{-2}$ , which is lower than the Pt/C + IrO<sub>2</sub>-based ZAB (103 mW cm $^{-2}$ ). At 10 mA cm $^{-2}$ , the specific capacity of MoNiFe-based ZAB is 572 mAh g $^{-1}$ , near that of Pt/C + IrO<sub>2</sub>-based ZAB (651 mAh g $^{-1}$ ). Although showed the lower opencircuit voltage and power density than the commercial Pt/C + IrO<sub>2</sub>-based ZAB, the rate and cycling performances of

Electrochemical Measurements: Electrochemical tests were performed using a three-electrode configuration controlled by a CHI600e electrochemical workstation. [47] The counter electrode and reference electrode are platinum disk electrode (diameter = 3 mm) and saturated Hg/HgO electrode (SCE), respectively. The employed working electrode was a glass carbon electrode (diameter = 3 mm) coated by electrocatalyst, and the electrolyte was 1 M KOH. For the ORR measurement, a rotating disk electrode (RDE, the area is 0.1963 cm²) and a rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE) (ring area: 0.16 cm², the disk area: 0.2375 cm²) were used. All recorded values were calibrated according to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) potential by using Equation (1)

$$E \text{ vs RHE} = 0.095 + 0.059 \text{ pH} + E \text{ vs Hg/HgO}$$
 (1)

The electrocatalyst was deposited on the working electrode by drop casting. 4.0 mg of the electrocatalyst was first dispersed in a mixed solution consisting of 0.5 mL of water, 0.5 mL of isopropanol, and 0.1 mL of Nafion solution, and sonicated for 20 min to result in a homogeneous suspension. Then, 30  $\mu$ l of the suspension was deposited on the disk electrode (ø = 5 mm), which was previously mechanically polished and ultrasonically cleaned with water and ethanol. After solvent evaporation, the working electrode coated by active samples was, thus, obtained for further electrochemical evaluation. Before each experiment, the electroyet was saturated with N2 or O2. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) were detected with scan rates at 50 and 5 mV s  $^{-1}$ , respectively. The number of transferred electrons (N) was estimated according to the Koutecky–Levich (K–L) equation, rotating disk electrode (RDE) experiments, and RRDE to determine whether the catalyst was a 4-electron or 2-electron transfer pathway during ORR.

The electron transfer number of the catalyst at a given potential was calculated according to the K-L equation, and the calculation method is shown in Equation (2) and (3)

$$\frac{1}{i} = \frac{1}{ik} + \frac{1}{B\omega^{1/2}} \tag{2}$$

$$B = 0.2nFC_0D_0^{2/3}\nu^{-1/6} \tag{3}$$

In Equation (2), j denotes the current density of the catalyst,  $j_k$  stands for the dynamic current density, B represents the Levich constant, and  $\omega$  equals the speed of the electrode. In Equation (3), F is Faraday constant (96 485 C mol $^{-1}$ ), n stands for electron transfer number,  $C_0 = 1.2 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{mol cm}^{-3}$  is the saturation concentration of oxygen in the used electrolyte (1 M KOH),  $D_0$  denotes the diffusion coefficient of oxygen ( $1.9 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{cm}^2 \, \text{s}^{-1}$ ), and  $\nu$  equals the viscosity coefficient (0.01 cm $^2 \, \text{s}^{-1}$ ) of 1 M KOH solution.

The number of electron transfer (n) and the yield of  $H_2O_2$  (%) at the speed of 1,600 rpm can be obtained by calculating the disk current ( $i_d$ ) and ring current ( $i_r$ ) according to Equation (4) and (5)

$$n = \frac{4|i_d|}{|i_d| + i_r/N} \tag{4}$$

$$H_2O_2 = \frac{200i_r/N}{|i_d| + i_r/N} \times 100\%$$
 (5)

where N represents the collection efficiency (37%) of RRDE electrode. Fabrication and Test of Rechargeable ZABs: First, 8 mg MoNiFe (IrO $_2$  + Pt/C) was ultrasonically dispersed in the mixture of 0.7 mL H $_2$ O/0.2 mL isopropanol/0.1 mL Nafion to form a catalyst ink. The resulting ink was then dropped on a steel mesh as the positive electrode of ZAB, and the polished zinc sheet as the negative electrode. 6 m KOH + 0.2 m Zn(AC) $_2$  solution was used as the electrolyte. The as-fabricated ZABs were tested on the CT3008W battery test system (Neware, China).

MoNiFe-based ZAB are superior to those of Pt/C+IrO<sub>2</sub> (Figure 7d-f). The rate stability of MoNiFe-based ZAB is obviously better than Pt/C + IrO<sub>2</sub>-based ZAB (Figure 7d), discerned from the returning of discharge voltages when the current increased from 2 to 50 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> and decreased back to  $2 \text{ mA cm}^{-2}$ . As shown in Figure 7e, the Pt/C + IrO<sub>2</sub>-based ZAB shows an enlarged charge-discharge voltage difference during the cycling compared with the stable charge/discharge behavior of MoNiFe-based ZAB. More clearly in Figure 7f, the potential difference of the charge-discharge platform for MoNiFe-based ZABs in the first cycle is 0.71 V, and even at the 450 th cycle, it does not change much (0.73 V). In addition, as a practical scenario, two MoNiFe-based ZABs can light up 15 light emitting diode (LED) lamps (Figure 7h), which indicates the MoNiFe prepared in this work possesses considerable potential application value.

## 3. Conclusion

In this article, a Fe-alloyed MoNi nanohybrid (MoNiFe) is prepared by a hydrothermal-reduction method. The alloyed MoNiFe architecture with the decreased size compared with MoNi exposes more active sites facilitating the ions transfer, good bifunctionality, with a positive half-wave potential (0.896 V) near Pt/C (0.812 V) for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and a suppressed overpotential (0.292 V) similar to IrO $_2$  (0.29 V) for OER. The as-derived rechargeable ZAB based on MoNiFe catalyst delivers a high peak power density reaching  $58\,\mathrm{mW\,cm^{-2}}$  and a high open-circuit voltage of 1.319 V. This work paves a feasible alloying way for the synthesis of effective bifunctional electrocatalysts for practical ZABs.

## 4. Experimental Section

*Materials*: Molybdenum pentachloride (MoCl<sub>5</sub>), IrO<sub>2</sub>, and Pt/C (20 wt%) were purchased from Aladdin Ltd., Shanghai. Nickel chloride (NiCl<sub>2</sub>·6H<sub>2</sub>O), ferric chloride (FeCl<sub>3</sub>·6H<sub>2</sub>O), ethanol (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O), hydrazine hydrate (N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>·H<sub>2</sub>O), and other reagents were purchased from Tianjin Damao Chemical, Ltd.

Synthesis of Fe-Alloyed MoNi Nanohybrids: First, 0.2160 g MoCl<sub>5</sub>, 0.0544 g FeCl<sub>3</sub>·6H<sub>2</sub>O, and 0.1920 g NiCl<sub>2</sub>·6H<sub>2</sub>O were put in 40 mL of ethanol and stirred for 15 min, and then 2 mL of hydrazine hydrate was added into the alcoholic solution. After stirring for 50 min, the homogeneous solution was moved to a hydrothermal reactor lined with PTFE and then reacted at 120 °C for 15 h. The obtained products from the reactor were filtered and washed for 6 times, and dried under vacuum at 50 °C for 48 h to acquire the Fe-alloyed MoNi nanohybrids (MoNiFe). For comparison, MoNi was also prepared without the presence of FeCl<sub>3</sub>·6H<sub>2</sub>O according to the above process.

Structural Characterization: The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the catalysts were obtained with a D2 Bruker X-ray diffractometer irradiated with Cu Kα. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) and energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) analysis were acquired by a field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) from FEI Co. of USA. A transmission electron microscope (TEM) from Nippon Co., Ltd. and a high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HR-TEM) from JEM-2100F were employed to measure the microstructure. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were measured on an Escalab 250Xi machine and all data were calibrated based on C 1s line (284.6 eV). The specific surface area of catalysts was estimated by using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method measured on an ASAP 2020 machine (Micromeritics, USA).

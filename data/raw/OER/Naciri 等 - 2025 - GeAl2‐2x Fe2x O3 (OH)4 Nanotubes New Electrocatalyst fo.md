**Ge-imogolite nanotubes (Ge-INT) are analogs of natural clay nanotubes formed in volcanic soils that attract growing interest. Despite their amazing structural properties, their use in water oxidation has not been reported yet. In this work, the potential of Fe-doped double-walled germanium imogolite nanotubes as low-cost and noble metal-free electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is demonstrated for the first time. Nanotube samples are synthesized via a one-step hydrothermal method, with Fe substitution ratios** *x* **up to 0.075. Fe-doped nanotubes retain their tubular structure, and investigation indicated homogeneous Fe distribution all over the nanotubes. Comprehensive structural, spectroscopic, and electrochemical analyses confirm successful Fe incorporation and enhanced electrochemical performance. The sample with** *x* **= 0.05 Fe content shows the best OER performance, achieving a low overpotential of 285 mV at 10 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2, a Tafel slope of 175 mV dec<sup>−</sup>1, and excellent charge transfer properties. Fe-doped INT demonstrates strong electrochemical stability over prolonged operation. These results highlight the promising use of geo-inspired Fe-doped imogolite as a sustainable and credible nobel-free electrocatalyst for efficient OER, expanding the potential of imogolite-based nanomaterials in water oxidation.**

# **1. Introduction**

Electrochemical water splitting has emerged as a promising strategy for the production of eco-friendly and sustainable hydrogen, allowing it to target carbon-neutral energy systems. It is well known that the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is the bottleneck that limits the energy efficiency of water-splitting.[\[1,2\]](#page-8-0) The OER is a complex multi-step process that requires four-electron transfer while facing competitive side peroxide formation. Major advances have been achieved with Ir- and Ru-based catalysts which are considered benchmark materials for OER.[\[3–5\]](#page-8-0) However, despite their balanced high activity and stability, the scarcity and high cost pose significant challenges for large-scale application compared to earth-abundant elements.[\[6\]](#page-8-0) Hence, the discovery of new cost-effective and noble metal-free materials without sacrificing

catalytic performance is of high interest. Various transition metal-based materials with nickel (Ni), cobalt (Co) and iron (Fe) were extensively studied as alternative OER electrocatalysts, including oxides,[\[7–10\]](#page-8-0) hydroxides/oxyhydroxides,[\[11,12\]](#page-8-0) layered double hydroxides,[\[13–15\]](#page-8-0) perovskites,[\[16\]](#page-8-0) metal-organic frameworks[\[17,18\]](#page-8-0) or high entropy oxides,[\[19,20\]](#page-8-0) to cite a few.

In this booming field, geo-inspired metal oxide nanotubes appear as emerging materials suitable for energy applications.[\[21\]](#page-8-0) Ge-imogolite nanotubes (Ge-INT) are an analog of natural imogolite clay nanotubes formed in volcanic soils that attract growing interest due to their simple synthesis under hydrothermal conditions and without the use of harsh solvents.[\[22,23\]](#page-8-0) Ge-INT can be obtained in large quantities as single-walled (SW) or doublewalled (DW) nanotubes, exhibiting a notably uniform diameter distribution (**Figure 1**A).[\[24–27\]](#page-8-0) The tube walls consist in a rolled gibbsite-like Al(OH)3 sheet on which isolated GeO3(OH) tetrahedrons are bonded upright to the octahedral vacancies for a general structural formula GeAl2O3(OH)4. In addition, these nanotubes present a unique permanent dipole density across the nanotube walls, leading to a real-space separation between the valence and the conduction band edges.[\[28,29\]](#page-8-0)

Strong efforts have been dedicated to finding versatile synthetic processes to generate new functionalities and broaden the range of INT's applications.[\[30–35\]](#page-8-0) Atomic substitution has offered some promises. A major challenge is to accommodate new atoms, typically transition metals, in order to increase the conductivity and optoelectronic properties while preserving structural and mechanical properties.[\[36,37\]](#page-8-0) Recently, our groups reported the potential of Ti-modified Ge-INT as a noble metal-free photocatalyst for efficient H2 generation compared to commercial anatase nanoparticles in similar conditions.[\[38\]](#page-8-0) These encouraging results prompted us to investigate other 3*d*-transition metal doping of Ge-INT that remains scarcely realized except for Fe atoms. Fe doping of proper imogolite shows that both direct synthesis and post-synthesis ionic exchange may lead to the isomorphic substitution of Fe3<sup>+</sup> for octahedral (Oh) Al<sup>3</sup><sup>+</sup> sites.[\[39–41\]](#page-8-0) In both approaches, partial isomorphic substitution by Fe3<sup>+</sup> enables the reduction of the nanotube band gap, imparting semiconducting behavior without disrupting the tubular structure. However, the use of these Fe-doped INT is still limited to photo-Fenton activity for dye degradation[\[42–44\]](#page-9-0) while a few studies suggest the beneficial effect of Fe sites in doped imogolite for electrocatalytic applications.[\[45,46\]](#page-9-0) Although some efforts have been deployed, expanding the range of applications INT has reached a bottleneck, probably due to the lack of detailed characterization of the electrochemical properties of imogolite nanotubes. In this work, we report the first use of Fe-doping of double-walled Ge-imogolite nanotubes (Ge-DWINT) as novel electrocatalysts for OER. In particular, we offer a comprehensive study detailing the structure, optical properties, and the first in-depth analysis of the electrochemical behavior of these original nanotubes, with a comparison to benchmark materials in the field.

## **2. Results and Discussion**

cursors in the presence of urea. In the present work, the substitution ratio *x* = [Fe]/([Al]+[Fe]) is varied from 0 to 0.075 (Figure [1B,](#page-1-0) see Experimental section). The reaction occurs in acidic conditions due to the release of protons related to the condensation of the precursors over time, as evidenced recently for pristine aluminogermanate imogolite double-walled nanotubes.[\[24\]](#page-8-0) After recovering the suspensions and dialysis (see Experimental section), the pH of the different suspensions is close to 6 (**Table 1**). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observations confirm the obtention of long and thin 1D nanoparticles, whatever the substitution ratio (**Figure 2**A–D). The length distribution, determined from the analysis of more than 400 particles, follows a log-normal distzribution (Figure S1, Supporting Information).

The average length is found ≈85 nm for *x* = 0 and increases up to ≈150 nm for *x* = 0.05, while it is reduced for the highest substitution ratio (Table 1). These values are typical for aluminogermanate nanotubes synthesized under hydrothermal treatment with urea.[\[38,47\]](#page-8-0) The increase in length at moderate Fe content can be attributed to the incorporation of Fe3<sup>+</sup> into the octahedral sites, which may promote anisotropic growth by slightly modifying the surface charge and crystal growth kinetics. However, for the highest substitution rate (*x* = 0.075), Fe likely exceeds the isomorphic substitution limit, leading to structural disturbances or the formation of Fe(oxy)hydroxide species. These effects hinder the regular elongation of the nanotubes, resulting in shorter average lengths. At this concentration, we also observe the presence of tiny dense aggregates on the outer surface of the tubes, as indicated by the white arrows in Figure 2D. High magnification is only possible by performing cryo-TEM since imogolite nanotubes are known to be sensitive to electron beam damage. Representative cryo-TEM images are presented in Figure 2E,F and Figures S2 and S3 (Supporting Information), confirming the tubular morphology of the samples with a double-walled shape. Moreover, we notice the presence of single-walled (SW) shape for Fe-doped nanotubes (see inset in Figure S3, Supporting Information). The proportion of SW compared to DW is ≈20% for *x* = 0.025 and 0.05, and reaches more than 40% for *x* = 0.075 (Table 1). The occurrence of SW nanotubes is interesting be-

cause they have been found as a transient form during the DW nanotube growth using the urea protocol.<sup>[24]</sup> The increase of the SW/DW ratio with the Fe content may suggest an inhibition of the DW growth during the ageing step due to the presence of iron in the starting solution. This is in line with the presence of dense particles in TEM images that could be related to Fe-rich oxides or oxyhydroxide clusters, as reported previously for Fe-doped imogolite-like nanotubes with substitution ratios higher than 0.05.<sup>[39,40,43]</sup>

scribed in detail in previous reports.<sup>[33,47–49]</sup> The doping induces also a shift of the correlation peaks toward lower values of the scattering vector modulus *Q*, i.e. to larger interparticle distances, while the volume fraction of the suspensions remains unchanged (Table 1). This feature compares with the presence of more SW nanotubes, which could disrupt the spontaneous self-assembly process. For higher *Q* values, the scattered intensity corresponds to the form factor of individual cylinders. As detailed in previous articles,<sup>[24,25,33]</sup> the scattered intensity from infinite DW nanotubes writes:

$$I_{DW}\left(Q\right) \propto \frac{1}{Q} \left(\tilde{\rho}_{INT}\left(Q\right) - \tilde{\rho}_{w}\left(Q\right)\right)^{2} \left(\frac{\left(R_{m,1} + \frac{e}{2}\right)J_{1}\left(Q\left(R_{m,1} + \frac{e}{2}\right)\right)}{Q} - \frac{\left(R_{m,1} - \frac{e}{2}\right)J_{1}\left(Q\left(R_{m,1} - \frac{e}{2}\right)\right)}{Q} + \frac{\left(R_{m,2} + \frac{e}{2}\right)J_{1}\left(Q\left(R_{m,2} + \frac{e}{2}\right)\right)}{Q} - \frac{\left(R_{m,2} - \frac{e}{2}\right)J_{1}\left(Q\left(R_{m,2} - \frac{e}{2}\right)\right)}{Q}\right)^{2}$$

The presence of iron in the samples is reflected by a noticeable change in color under visible light (**Figure 3A**). All samples form stable colloidal dispersions. When observed between crossed polarizers, these samples display birefringent textures. This simple observation confirms that Fe-doping preserves the intrinsic liquid-crystalline properties of Ge-DWINTs. The structure of the nanotubes in dispersion was investigated by smallangle X-ray scattering (SAXS) experiments. SAXS profiles of samples with substitution ratio  $x \le 0.05$  exhibit several sharp reflections that can be indexed with a 2D hexagonal lattice related to the columnar hexagonal (Col<sub>H</sub>) phase (Figure S4, Supporting Information). This corresponds to the positional order of imogolite nanotubes in the plane perpendicular to their main axis, de-

 $R_{m,1}$  and  $R_{m,2}$  correspond to the mean radii of the inner and outer walls of the DW nanotube;  $\tilde{\rho}_{INT}$  and  $\tilde{\rho}_w$  are the Fourier transforms of the imogolite wall and water densities, respectively, and  $J_1$  is the cylindrical Bessel function of order 1. Taking into account a wall thickness e=6 Å and a gap g between inner and outer walls equal to  $2\text{Å},^{[33]}$  the mean nanotube inner and outer diameters are 2.15 and 3.9 nm, respectively.

To confirm these observations, the iron substitution in Ge-DWINTs is probed by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) on a widerange of scattering vector modulus Q ( $Q = 4\pi/\lambda \sin(\theta)$  with  $2\theta$  the scattering angle, Figure 3B). The diffractograms display broad oscillations related to the form factor of the nanotubes due to their finite radial dimension. The PXRD diffractogram for the

highest substitution ratio (*x* = 0.075) also displays two additional broad peaks at around *Q* = 2.494 and 2.825 Å<sup>−</sup>1, corresponding to interplanar spacings *d* of 2.52 and 2.22 Å, respectively (Figure S5a, Supporting Information). These peaks correlate well with the (110) plane (*d* = 2.51 Å) and the (113) plane (*d* = 2.22 Å) of -Fe2O3, suggesting the possible presence of -Fe2O3 impurities that inevitably co-precipitate at high Fe content.[\[40,43\]](#page-9-0) The period *T* along the nanotube long axis *z* can be obtained from the welldefined peaks around *Q* = 1.5, 3, and 4.5 Å<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> as indicated by the vertical dotted lines in Figure [3B.](#page-3-0) [\[50\]](#page-9-0) Due to the asymmetric shape of the peaks (Figure S5A, Supporting Information), the value of the period is determined from the position of the inflexion point of the 002 peak, which is emphasized by plotting the maximum of the 1st derivative (Figure S5B, Supporting Information). The period of all Ge-DWINTs is equal to 8.54 Å, whatever the Fe content. However, the 002 peak is strongly attenuated for Fe-doped Ge-DWINTs. This reflects a decrease in the coherence length along the nanotube axis with the incorporation of iron atoms into the nanotube structure.[\[51\]](#page-9-0) While Fe3<sup>+</sup> has an ionic radius close to that of Al3<sup>+</sup>, its incorporation into the octahedral sites can still lead to subtle variations in bond lengths and angles due to differences in electronic configuration and local coordination environment. These distortions break the periodicity along the *z*-axis, thus reducing the long-range order responsible for coherent scattering and causing broadening and attenuation of the 00l reflections.

The infrared spectra of Fe-doped Ge-DWINTs samples were determined in the mid-infrared range (MIR, Figure [3C\)](#page-3-0). The structure of imogolite nanotubes is built on Ge─O─Al bonds with hydroxyl groups on the inner wall (Ge-OH) and outer wall Al2(OH). The related absorption bands are mainly observed at low wavenumbers. The bands at 355 and 420 cm<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> are assigned to Al─O bending modes, while those located at 555 and 680 cm<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> correspond to various Al─O modes with a shoulder at 470 cm<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> related to Ge─O bending vibration.[\[47,52\]](#page-9-0) The doublet band at 800/830 cm<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> and the absorption band at 910 cm<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> are characteristic fingerprints of the imogolite nanotube structure related to Ge─O stretching vibrations.[\[26,47\]](#page-8-0) However, this doublet reduces to a single broad peak with the increase of the substitution ratio. A similar broadening effect was observed during the early stages of the DWINT growth due to the presence of defects.[\[24\]](#page-8-0) In addition, the isomorphic substitution of Al by Fe atoms implies Al─Fe─O and Fe─Fe─O bending modes that are typically observed in the 800–900 cm<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> wavenumber range.[\[53\]](#page-9-0) The OH stretching region (3000–3750 cm<sup>−</sup>1) is characterized by two broad absorption bands at 3390 and 3575 cm<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> assigned to internal and external OH groups, respectively.[\[24,54\]](#page-8-0)

We conducted X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy to probe the coordination and the local environment of Fe atoms. Normalized XANES spectra acquired at the Fe Kedge (**Figure 4**A) show a pre-edge peak at 7113 eV due to the 1s <sup>→</sup> 3d transition of Fe atoms in octahedral coordination.[\[55\]](#page-9-0) The main absorption band located at 7126 eV arises from 1s to 4s transition, which is 2 eV higher than Fe-sorbed onto natural aluminosilicate imogolite nanotubes.[\[55\]](#page-9-0) The shift of the main transition is indicative of differences of first-neighbor bonding distances,[\[56\]](#page-9-0) which differ if Fe atoms are structurally incorporated into the nanotube structure or not. A proof of Fe incorporation is provided by the presence of a resonance at 7132 eV, highlighted by plotting the first derivative of the normalized absorbance (Figure S6, Supporting Information). This component is linked to the incorporation of iron into octahedral sites, as demonstrated in the case of Fedoped phyllosilicate nanosheets.[\[57\]](#page-9-0) To get a deep insight of the crystal-chemistry of our synthetic samples, we quantified at the submicrometer scale the ferric/ferrous iron ratio at the L3 edge using scanning transmission X-ray microscopy (STXM-XANES). The XANES spectra at the Fe-L3 edge are characterized by two peaks at 708.7 and 710.2 eV, named L3-a and L3-b in the following (Figure 4B). The intensity of the L3-a peak is systematically lower than that of the L3-b peak. We employed the analytical method **[www.advancedsciencenews.com](http://www.advancedsciencenews.com) [www.afm-journal.de](http://www.afm-journal.de)**

interface, and Rct is the charge transfer resistance across the interface of electrode/electrolyte. [\[71\]](#page-9-0) Thus, the arcs in the Nyquist

plot are related to charge transfer at the interface of the photoelectrode/electrolyte. The fitted values of Rc are found at 1385.7, 1188.4, 519.48, 872.71 Ω for electrodes prepared with samples at *x* = 0 to 0.075, respectively. The efficient charge transfer between the photoelectrode/electrolyte interface hinders the charge recombination and induces efficient charge transport of electrons through the films. Thus, the *x* = 0.05 Fe-doped Ge-DWINT electrode has a very good efficiency of charge transfer, showing the lowest Rct. To understand the superior oxygen evolution performance of

the prepared electrodes, we examined several potential contributing factors. The double-layer capacitance (Cdl), which is indicative of the electrochemical surface area (ECSA), is calculated using cyclic voltammetry (CV).[\[72\]](#page-9-0) The Cdl value is determined from the slope of the linear relationship between the non-faradaic capacitive current and scan rate (Figure S9A–D, Supporting Information). As expected, the electrocatalyst at *x* = 0.05 exhibits the largest ECSA, pointing to a higher density of active sites at the solid-liquid interface. The Cdl for *x* = 0.05 is measured at 3.87 μF cm<sup>−</sup>2, significantly greater than those of *x* = 0 (0.51 μF cm<sup>−</sup>2), *x* = 0.025 (2.67 μF cm<sup>−</sup>2), and *x* = 0.075 (2.99 μF cm<sup>−</sup>2) (Figure [5F\)](#page-6-0).

The enhanced OER performance observed at *x* = 0.05 may also be attributed to the favorable redox behavior of iron. The redox state of iron plays a crucial role in tuning catalytic activity during the oxygen evolution reaction. While our STXM analysis (Figure [4B\)](#page-4-0) confirms the predominance of Fe<sup>3</sup><sup>+</sup>, it is important to highlight that the dynamic interconversion between Fe2<sup>+</sup> and Fe3<sup>+</sup> is essential for achieving high OER performance. Fe3<sup>+</sup> is generally considered the catalytically active species due to its favorable electronic configuration for stabilizing oxygenated intermediates (\*OH, \*O, \*OOH).[\[73,74\]](#page-9-0) However, Fe2<sup>+</sup> contributes to the redox flexibility of the catalyst, facilitating electron transfer and lowering energy barriers during key reaction steps.[\[75\]](#page-9-0) Moreover, the reversible Fe<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup>/Fe3<sup>+</sup> cycling under OER conditions supports efficient electron–proton coupling, which is essential for catalytic turnover.[\[74,75\]](#page-9-0) This electronic adaptability may contribute to the superior charge transfer kinetics and improved OER performance observed in the *x* = 0.05 sample.

The long-term electrochemical stability of an electrocatalyst is a critical factor for its practical and industrial applications. Thus, the stability of the *x* = 0.05 Fe-doped Ge-DWINT electrocatalyst is evaluated using constant current chronoamperometry. A 16-h continuous electrolysis test (Figure [5G\)](#page-6-0) shows a negligible decrease in current density, confirming the stability of this sample in an alkaline solution. This effect is confirmed by measuring the diffractograms of Fe-doped Ge-DWINTs (*x* = 0.05) on a sample recovered after OER tests and to compare with a fresh sample (Figure S10, Supporting Information). The results reveal that the typical oscillations related to the double-walled form factor as well as the period *T* along the nanotube axis are retained after electrochemical tests. Additionally, the polarization curve (Figure [5H\)](#page-6-0) demonstrates minimal degradation even after 2000 CV cycles, further validating the electrocatalyst's durability in alkaline conditions for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER).

proposed by Bourdelle et al.[\[58\]](#page-9-0) to retrieve Fe3<sup>+</sup>/ΣFe ratios from the L3-b/L3-a intensity ratio. This approach also allows mapping the Fe3<sup>+</sup>/ΣFe ratio at a spatial scale of 20 nm (Figure [4C\)](#page-4-0), which is four times the nanotube diameter, but without destroying the sample with the X-ray beam. The hyperspectral image obtained before the absorption edge shows absorption related to the thickness of the particles (or particle agglomerates) as illustrated in Figure S7A (Supporting Information). At the Fe absorption edge, the corresponding hyperspectral image displays absorption related to both the thickness of the particles and the iron concentration. By subtracting this image from the previous one allows us to obtain a map of Fe distribution (Figure S7B, Supporting Information), revealing that all particles contain iron. The comparison of absorption before and at the edge for each pixel presents an excellent correlation (Figure S7C, Supporting Information), which implies that the iron content is proportional to the thickness of the particles or agglomerates. These data prove unambiguously that Fe atoms are incorporated homogeneously into the nanotubes. Furthermore, the Fe<sup>3</sup><sup>+</sup>/ΣFe is always over 70% whatever the initial substitution ratio.

The electrocatalytic OER activity of Fe-doped Ge-DWINTs is evaluated in 1M KOH using a three-electrode system. As shown in **Figure 5**[A,](#page-6-0) the polarization curves reveal that Fe doping significantly improves the OER performance. The presence of Fe sites in the imogolite structure facilitates enhanced OER activity, as all Fe-doped Ge-DWINT samples exhibit considerably lower overpotentials compared to unmodified Ge-DWINT. Specifically, the 0.05 Fe-doped Ge-DWINT electrocatalyst achieves an overpotential of 285 mV, while the overpotentials for *x* = 0.075, 0.025, and 0 are 331, 426, and 695 mV, respectively. This clearly indicates that Fe doping plays a crucial role in enhancing OER efficiency.

Furthermore, as shown in Figure [5B,C,](#page-6-0) the sample prepared at *x* = 0.05 presents the smallest Tafel slope of 175 mV dec<sup>−</sup>1, outperforming Fe-doped Ge-DWINTs at *x* = 0.075 (226 mV dec<sup>−</sup>1) and *x* = 0.025 (235 mV dec<sup>−</sup>1), and unmodified Ge-DWINT (300 mV dec<sup>−</sup>1). In order to go further, we measure an IrO2 sample under the same experimental conditions as those used for our samples (Figure S8, Supporting Information). We find an overpotential of 392 mV in good agreement with the literature[\[59\]](#page-9-0) while the related Tafel slope is close to 200 mV.dec<sup>−</sup>1, highlighting the competitiveness of our catalysts compared to this benchmark material. Considering both its low overpotential and small Tafel slope, the as-synthesized Fe-doped Ge-DWINT at *x* = 0.05 demonstrates highly competitive OER activity compared to usually reported electrocatalysts (Figure [5D\)](#page-6-0).[\[60–70\]](#page-9-0)

The electrochemical impedance spectra (Figure [5E\)](#page-6-0) provide further evidence of the performance of the electrodes prepared with *x* = 0.05 Fe-doped sample. The results demonstrate smaller charge transfer resistance than for the other catalysts, indicated by the lower diameter of the semicircle in the Nyquist plot. The Fe substitution changes the conductivity of the originally insulating INT and facilitates the charge transfer. The Nyquist plots of the as-synthesized catalysts have been further fitted with the Randles equivalent circuit model, which is represented in the inset of Figure [5E](#page-6-0) and Table S1 (Supporting Information). In the equivalent Randle circuit, Rs is the solution resistance, Q1 corresponds to the constant phase element (CPE) for the electrolyte/electrode

## **3. Conclusion**

This study demonstrates, for the first time, the performance of Fe-doped double-walled germanium imogolite nanotubes as efficient, noble metal-free electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction. Through a one-step hydrothermal synthesis, iron was successfully incorporated into the imogolite framework without compromising the nanotube shape, as confirmed by a suite of advanced structural and spectroscopic analyses. Fe atoms are incorporated in the octahedral sites of the nanotubes. Chemical

mapping at the nanometer scale reveals a homogenous distribution of Fe sites along the nanotubes with a Fe<sup>3+</sup>/ $\Sigma$ Fe value always greater than 70%, regardless of the substitution ratio. The isomorphic substitution of Al3+ by Fe3+ has a limited effect on the local structure of Ge-DWINTs for low substitution ratios, except for x higher than 0.05 for which  $Fe_2O_3$  particles are formed within the nanotubes. The introduction of Fe atoms during the synthesis led to a significant reduction in the band gap energy value (from 5.32 to 2.70 eV) while preserving the nanotubes' original properties such as spontaneous self-organization in aqueous media. Among the compositions tested, the sample with a Fe substitution ratio of x = 0.05 exhibited the best OER performance, achieving a low overpotential of 285 mV at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, a favorable Tafel slope of 175 mV dec<sup>-</sup>, and the lowest charge transfer resistance. It also demonstrated excellent durability under prolonged alkaline electrolysis and minimal degradation over 2000 CV cycles. All these findings highlight the promise of geo-inspired noble-free Ge-DWINTs as a sustainable and scalable alternative to conventional noble metal-based OER catalysts, while opening new avenues for the application of imogolitebased nanomaterials in electrocatalysis and renewable energy technologies.

#### 4. Experimental Section

Chemical Products: Tetraethoxygermane, aluminum perchlorate non-ahydrate, iron chloride hexahydrate, urea, and potassium bromide were purchased from Sigma–Aldrich. All products were ACS grade. Synthesis and dialysis were performed using Milli-Q water.

Synthesis of Fe-Doped Aluminogermanate Nanotubes: Fe-doped Ge-INTs were synthesized by adapting the protocol of Amara et al.<sup>[25]</sup> using the homogeneous hydrolysis of precursors through thermal decomposition of urea, CO(NH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>. The pH of the reaction is controlled by the consumption of OH ions released by the decomposition of urea over time. Details of the synthesis parameters and optimization can be found elsewhere.  $^{[24,47]}$  Solutions of aluminum perchlorate nonahydrate and iron chloride hexahydrate were prepared at different substitution ratios (x =[Fe]/([Al]+[Fe]) = 0, 0.025, 0.05, and 0.075) with a [Al]+[Fe] molar concentration of 0.2 mol.L<sup>-1</sup>. For each ratio, the solution was mixed with tetraethoxygermane and urea with a molar ratio of [Al]:[Ge]:[urea] equal to 2:1:2 under magnetic stirring at 500 rpm during 5 min (Fisherbrand  $^{\text{TM}}$ microstirrer). The mixtures were transferred in Teflon-lined autoclaves (Parr Instrument or Maximator) that were placed in an oven to ensure the hydrothermal ageing under autogenous pressure at 140 °C for 5 days. The purification of the samples was performed using dialysis membranes (Spectra/Por, cutoff at 10 kDa) against Milli-Q water until the conductivity was below 5 μS.cm<sup>-1</sup>, which corresponds to 10 dialysis sessions spread over one week.<sup>[76]</sup> After dialysis, the pH of the dispersions is pprox6.5. The volume fraction  $\phi$  of the purified suspensions was determined as  $\phi = C/\rho_{INT}$ , where C is the solid concentration of the sample determined by weight loss upon drying and  $\rho_{INT}$  the density of a nanotube  $(\approx 3.6 \text{ g.cm}^{-3}).^{[32]}$ 

Morphology: Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observations were carried out on a JEOL1400 microscope. The electron beam was set at 80 kV to avoid any beam damage. Dilute suspensions of samples were prepared at 4 mg.L $^{-1}$  in ethanol, and a drop was deposited on carbon-coated copper grids. The length distributions were determined using Fiji software. To gro-TEM observations were realized on a FEI Tecnai G2 Polara device operating at 300 kV, under low electron illumination conditions (dose < 15 e $^{-}$ Å $^{-2}$ ) and equipped with a K2 summit direct detector (Gatan). The samples were prepared as dilute suspensions (≈10 mg L $^{-1}$ ) that were deposited on an R2/2 Quantifoil grid ionized by glow discharging. The samples were then vitrified into liquid ethane cooled by liquid

nitrogen, to prevent the formation of ice crystals, thanks to a fully automated Vitrobot (FEI) device.

Structural Properties: Mid-infrared (MIR) transmission spectra were obtained using a Thermo-Nicolet FTIR 6700 spectrometer equipped with an Ever-Glo source, a CsI beam splitter, and a DTGS-CsI detector. MIR spectra resulted from the average of 100 scans acquired in transmission mode over the 250–4000 cm<sup>-1</sup> range with a resolution of 4 cm<sup>-1</sup>. For analyses, pellets were prepared by mixing 1 mg of powdered samples with 150 mg of KBr, and pressed at 8 kbar using a hydraulic press, and then dried at 110 °C. Macroscopic optical images were taken under visible light (VL) and between crossed polarizers (POL) using a Panasonic DMC-FZ18 digital camera.

Synchrotron-Based Experiments: All synchrotron radiation experiments were performed at SOLEIL synchrotron (Saint-Aubin, France). Powder Xray diffraction was carried out on the CRISTAL beamline using a two-circle diffractometer equipped with silicon-strip linear detectors (Mythen2, Dectris). The wavelength was set at  $\lambda = 0.5463$  Å. The configuration allowed covering a scattering wavevector Q range of 0.3-10 Å<sup>-1</sup> ( $Q = 4\pi/\lambda \sin(\theta)$ with  $2\theta$  the scattering angle). The samples were put into glass capillaries of 0.3 mm diameter (GLAS, Schönwalde bei Berlin, Germany). PXRD patterns of post-stability testing were acquired on a microfocus rotating anode generator (MicroMax-007, Rigaku) operating at the copper wavelength ( $\lambda_{CuK\alpha} = 0.1542$  nm) and equipped with a multilayer optic (FPX3D Cu14-39, Xenocs). 2D patterns were collected on a MAR345 detector (pixel size = 150 μm, marXperts GmgH, Germany) with a sample-to-detector distance of 250 mm. Conventional Fe K-edge XANES were performed at LUCIA beamline with an X-ray beam monochromatized with a Si (111) crystal. Spectra were acquired with steps of 0.2 eV in the edge region and of 1 eV up to 7300 eV, at a counting rate of 2 s per step. The data acquisition was realized in fluorescence mode using a mono-element (60 mm<sup>2</sup>) silicon drift diode detector. The Athena software was used to process, normalize, and analyze the data. [78] XANES mapping at the Fe  $\rm L_3$  edge was acquired using the scanning transmission X-ray microscope endstation of the HERMES beamline.  $^{[79]}$  This approach allowed to record the transmitted soft X-ray intensity on samples with a thickness < 100 nm that are prepared by dispersion on a copper grid as for conventional TEM. Hyperspectral images were obtained by scanning – with a spatial resolution of 20 nm – the area of interest in the x-y direction over the 700–730 eV energy range (Fe L<sub>3</sub>-edge) using an energy increment of 0.1 eV around the maximum absorption peaks. Spectra were extracted from stacks using the aXis2000 software<sup>[80]</sup> and processed following a protocol proposed by Bourdelle et al.<sup>[58]</sup> Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) was performed at the SWING beamline (SOLEIL synchrotron) at a fixed energy of 16 keV. The scattering patterns were collected on an Eiger 4M photon-counting X-ray detector (Dectris) placed in the vacuum tunnel of the beamline. Two distances (6.2 and 0.5 m) were used, allowing to cover a Q range of 2.10<sup>-3</sup>- $0.4 \text{ Å}^{-1}$ . The liquid samples were held in borosilicate capillaries (diameter  $\approx\!$  1.5 mm) that were flame-sealed and stored vertically prior to SAXS measurements. Data reduction of the scattering patterns was obtained using the FOXTROT program available on the beamline.

Electrochemical Measurements: Electrochemical measurements were carried out using a Metrohm Autolab electrochemical workstation. For the preparation of the catalyst ink, 5 mg of catalyst was dispersed in a solution consisting of 950  $\mu L$  of ethanol and 50  $\mu L$  of 5 wt.% Nafion, followed by sonication for 30 min. The OER activity of the as-prepared catalysts in 1M KOH electrolyte solution was determined by a typical three-electrode cell, in which the catalyst-loaded commercial carbon cloth (1.0 cm  $\times$  1.0 cm, loading: 0.1 mg cm<sup>-2</sup>) was dried at ambient temperature before electrochemical measurements. Potentials measured against the Ag/AgCl reference electrode were converted to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale using the Nernst Equation:  $E_{RHE} = E_{Ag/AgCl} + 0.0591pH + 0.197$ . Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was performed at a scan rate of 5 mV s<sup>-1</sup> to obtain polarization curves. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were conducted at a fixed potential over a frequency range of  $1 \times 10^{-5}$  to  $1 \times 10^{5}$  Hz. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was carried out between 1.06 and 1.16 V (vs. RHE) at scan rates of 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 mV  $s^{-1}$ . The specific capacitance of the electrical double layer ( $C_{dl}$ ) was derived from the CV curves.

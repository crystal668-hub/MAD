**Abstract:** The construction of highly active and durable nonnoble-metal electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is an ongoing challenge. Here, we report the development of a hybrid nanostructure of PBA cubes wrapped with mixed W-Co oxysulfides in a hair-like structure through sulfurization of polyoxometalate (CoIIIW12 POM) as a bimetallic precursor. These unique heterostructures of PBA@Co W O S grafted on carbon cloth afford abundant active sites and improved charge transfer kinetics that synergistically enhance the OER activity (overpotential of 250 mV at 10 mAcm <sup>2</sup> ). The synthetic approach used in this report can be extended for developing inexpensive, durable and efficient catalysts with diverse structures.

## **1. Introduction**

The oxygen evolution reaction, OER, a crucial half-reaction in water-splitting, is often considered the bottleneck due to its sluggish kinetics involving four-electron-transfer steps. In contrast to acidic OER, the alkaline OER possesses more favorable reaction kinetics due to the abundant hydroxyl ions in the electrolyte. In acidic media, the cleavage of the O-H bond in H2O requires high energy, dictating to more sluggish kinetics.[1]

The catalytic OER process involves four consecutive electrochemical steps: i) formation of M OH by one-electron oxidation of hydroxide anion; ii) coupled proton and electron removals from M OH to give M O; iii) a nucleophilic attack of hydroxyl anion on M O coupled with one-electron oxidation yielding the hydroperoxide intermediate M OOH; iv) a further proton-coupled electron transfer resulted in the release of O2 and the regeneration of the free active site.[2–4] Noble metal oxides (IrOx and RuOx) are the benchmarked OER electrocatalysts;[5] however, their scarcity, high cost, and stability issues restrict their large-scale applications for the electrochemical water-splitting.[6] In recent years, non-noble metal oxide and sulfide surfaces attracted considerable attention as electrocatalysts for water splitting,[7–9] though the sulfides, including transition metal dichalcogenides – TMDCs, tend to be converted to oxides/hydroxides under oxidative conditions.[10] Often, converted metal oxides/hydroxides exhibit apparent electrocatalytic performance better than the corresponding oxides/hydroxides directly synthesized.[10,11] Song et al. have attributed the enhanced catalytic activity to unusual amorphous or metastable metal oxide/hydroxide phases, better conductivity of the sulfide scaffold, or the synergistic electronic interactions between the different components.[10] Domen et al. have synthesized an oxysulfidebased catalyst for overall water splitting.[12] Where combined with oxygen, surface S2 ions are stabilized by hybridizing the S-*3p* and O-*2p* orbitals; therefore, oxysulfides are more durable against self-oxidation and recently gained considerable attention.[12–15]

Multimetallic-based catalysts are considered excellent OER electrocatalysts due to their unique physicochemical properties, such as excellent redox reversibility, chemical stability, electrical conductivity, accelerated charge transfer, and richer redox reactions compared to their monometallic counterpart.[9,16,17] Moreover, the existence of multiple valence cations offers donor-acceptor chemisorption sites for the reversible adsorption of oxygen species, enhancing the OER catalysis.[16]

Prussian blue analogs, PBAs, have the general structure of AxMa[Mb(CN)6]y·zH2O, in which A refers to the cations hosted in the framework channels, while Ma and Mb refer to the transition metals linked by the cyanide ligands.[18] They are widely known MOFs with inherent properties like intrinsic open framework structure, large interstitial sites, high surface

area, and uniform porosity. Such advantages make them promising candidates in electric energy storage, catalysis, and hydrogen storage applications.[19–21] Interestingly, the electronic properties of the PBAs can be tailored by chemical modifications.[18] However, due to poor electrical conductivity, the PBAs hold limited OER activity without conducting support.[22,23] Also, the binding force between the PBA and bare electrodes is relatively weak, resulting in stability issues.[24] A heterostructure that combines the PBA with transition metal oxysulfides may show better electrocatalytic activity than its counterparts while exploiting their advantages. Moreover, loading this heterostructure on a carbon cloth will improve the adherence of the PBA to the electrode.

TMDCs, especially sulfides,[25–27] selenides,[28–30] and oxides,[31,32] have recently attained tremendous interest as electrocatalysts for water-splitting because of their stability, abundance, and cost-effectiveness.[33,34] In the family of common TMDCs, tungsten is the heaviest one; therefore, controlling its compound properties is easier. [35] Tungsten is commercially more favorable than molybdenum due to its higher abundance. However, due to its poor electronic conductivity and inefficient contact with the substrate, modification and hybridization with other materials are necessary to gain the desired stability and electrocatalytic properties for the W-based catalysts.[36]

Recall the instability of metal sulfides under OER conditions; these catalysts are, in fact, mixtures of metal oxides and sulfides. Hence, metal oxysulfides are great candidates to produce efficient catalysts. Recent reports show that incorporating heteroatoms such as oxygen in PBA increases the active sites and conductivity, promoting the OER catalytic activity. [12,37] Wen and co-workers prepared A-CoS4.6O0.6 porous nanocubes, using crystalline Co Fe PBA with a well-defined nanocubic structure as the precursor, followed by galvanic replacement reaction with Na2S showing a high activity for OER (deliver a current density of 10 mAcm <sup>2</sup> at 1.52 V).[37] Polyanionic metal oxide clusters, also called polyoxometalates (POMs), are excellent precursors to generate metal-based composites, including TMDCs.[38] Here, we partially sulfurized cobalt tungstate POM to produce bimetallic oxysulfide structures. The use of POM provides easier dispersion of the metal oxides on the carbon cloth substrate and an excellent metal oxide skeleton to be sulfurized.[39]

This work reports the synthesis of mixed metal oxysulfides (WOxSy/CoOxSy hair-like composites) on top of PBA nanocube templates using the polyoxometalate K5[CoIIIW12O40], denoted as CoIIIW12 POM, as a bimetallic source. These hybrid structures were grown directly on carbon cloth to form the PBA@Co W O S/CC heterostructure. This unique PBA@Co W O S/CC heterostructure shows an excellent OER catalytic performance in 1.0 M KOH, delivering a current density of 10 mAcm <sup>2</sup> at an overpotential of only 250 mV.

### **2. Experimental Section**

A hydrothermal synthesis method was used to grow a unique trimetallic heterostructure on carbon cloth (CC). The synthesis of the PBA@Co W O S/CC heterostructure, illustrated in Scheme 1, is as follows: Solution A was prepared by dissolving 60 mg of the already synthesized CoFe PBA nanocubes in 15 mL of deionized (DI) water. Simultaneously, 20 mg of CoIIIW12 POM and 40 mg of thiourea (TU) were dissolved in another 10 mL of DI water to form solution B. Then, solution B was transferred into solution A under vigorous stirring for 15 min. The resulting mixture was then set for a hydrothermal reaction in a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave with two pieces of CC (1×2 cm<sup>2</sup> ) for 24 h at 180°C. The average mass loading of the catalyst on the CC was *ca.* 4 mg cm <sup>2</sup> . The Supporting Information (SI) file contains the detailed synthesis procedures of CoFe PBA, CoIIIW12 POM, characterizations, and complementary electrochemical data.

### **3.1 Structural Characterization**

Field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) demonstrates the morphology of the as-synthesized catalysts at three different magnifications, Figure 1. The CC fibrous morphology with a 3D carbon fiber network, on which the catalysts were grown, can be seen in the low magnification images. The FE-SEM images of the PBA/CC show the uniform coverage of the PBA nanocubes on the thin fibers of the carbon cloth, Figure 1a. The magnified image of PBA/CC

validates the uniformity of the PBA nanocubes size. The W–Co-based sulfide nanocubes can be synthesized by anchoring POM (M=W, Co) onto PBA followed by sulfurization with thiourea; the PBA@Co–W–O–S/CC heterostructure produced shows a distinct structural alteration, Figure 1b. Uniform-sized hair-like structures homogeneously cover the entire surface of the CC substrate and PBA nanocubes. It can be seen that the hybrids retain their nanocube architecture like that of the PBA template, but rougher surfaces are observed for the hybrids after incorporating the sulfurization process.

The HR-TEM (Figure 2a) displays well lattice fringes with d-spacings of 0.273, 0.274, and 0.284 nm; these d-spacings were assigned to the (100) crystal planes of WS<sub>2</sub>, (200) of CoS<sub>2</sub>, [39,40] and (002) plane of FeS, respectively; [39] suggesting the successful hybridization of WS<sub>2</sub>, CoS<sub>2</sub> and FeS in the heterostructure formation. Surprisingly, the STEM images of PBA@Co-W-O-S/CC heterostructure show an inner pattern in the PBA cubes, attributed to the leaching of some internal ions from the cubes, Figure 2b-d. The STEM-EDX elemental mapping images of the heterostructure reveal the coexistence of the Co and Fe in the PBA cubes together with S, and relatively low content of W. Whereas the outer surface shows the presence of Co, W, and S, together with Fe. This finding suggests that the sulfurization process induces iron leaching from the inner PBA. Table S1 summarizes the atomic percent of all the elements in the heterostructure from the EDX analysis. The atomic mole respective percentage of S and O are 10.6 and 18.2%, indicating the partial sulfurization and substoichiometric metal-sulfide formation and eventually the formation of mixed metal oxysulfide species.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used to analyze the crystal phases. The diffraction pattern of the PBA/CC in Figure S2a presents the typical PBA face-centered cubic crystal structure (in accord with JCPDS card no. 75-0038 of CoFe-PBA). The

diffraction pattern of the PBA@Co-W-O-S/CC heterostructure in Figure S2b suggests that the heterostructure contains a metal sulfides mixture with the fingerprints of WS<sub>2</sub>, CoS<sub>2</sub>, and FeS phases (JCPDS cards no. 08-0237, 65-3322, and 76-0962, respectively); however, the patterns differ from these of solid PBA, which can be attributed to metal substitution. Moreover, PBA@Co-W-O-S XRD peaks are lower and broader due to a decrease in the original crystallinity, though the cube morphology is preserved even after the digestive sulfurization process. The reduced crystallinity of the obtained composite has implications for its catalytic properties because amorphous materials can produce many local defects (as seen in Figure S3), serving as active sites to increase the catalyst activity.<sup>[41]</sup>

The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis supported the formation of mixed metal sulfides/oxides in the heterostructure (Figure S4). The  $2p_{3/2}$  and  $2p_{1/2}$  spectra of Fe and Co indicate on Fe(II)/Fe(III) and Co(II)/Co(III) species, Figure 3a-b. Some peaks at higher binding energies are attributed to oxidized Fe and Co species, in addition to FeS<sub>x</sub>O<sub>y</sub>/CoS<sub>x</sub>O<sub>y</sub>, which can also be assigned in the XPS spectra. In the high-resolution spectrum of W 4f, Figure 3c, two peaks assigned to W  $4f_{7/2}$  and W  $4f_{5/2}$  can be found at 34.4 eV and 36.6 eV with a binding energy split of 2.2 eV, confirming the presence of  $W^{5+}$  in  $W^vO_xS_v^{-[42]}$  The doublet peaks observed at higher binding energies correspond to W<sup>6+</sup> while shifting from the typical values, [43,44] confirming the complex environment of the W atom at the hybrid's surface. The S 2p deconvoluted spectrum (Figure 3d) shows peaks around 162.0  $(2p_{1/2})$  and 163.3 eV  $(2p_{3/2})$ , corresponding to S<sup>2-</sup>, typical for Metal-S bonds. Additional peaks are attributed to the edge sulfur  $S_2^{2-}$  (164.8 eV,  $2p_{3/2}$ ) and the oxidized S species around 168.5 eV (Figure 3d). The presence of terminal  $S_2^{2-}$  generally points to low-coordination S atoms related to

defects or edge sites. It was claimed that these unsaturated S atoms in Metal-S could be exposed as active catalytic sites.[45,46]

#### **3.2 Electrochemical Measurements**

The OER performance of the synthesized catalysts was investigated in a standard three-electrode system containing Ar-saturated 1.0 M KOH electrolyte, using a graphite rod, Hg/ HgO, and the as-prepared catalysts anchored on carbon fiber cloth as the counter electrode, the reference, and the working electrode, respectively.

The polarization curves recorded by linear scan voltammetry (LSV) are presented in Figure 4a. It can be seen that the hybrid structure PBA@Co W O S/CC exhibits superior catalytic activity, better than pure PBA and bare CC, requiring a potential of 1.48 V to reach the benchmark current density of 10 mAcm <sup>2</sup> , corresponding to an overpotential (η10) of only 250 mV (Figure 4a). The hybrid PBA@Co W O S/CC also possesses a lower Tafel slope, indicating its enhanced kinetics toward OER (Figure 4b). The PBA/CC attains the benchmark current density at an overpotential of 320 mV. Bare CC substrate shows poor OER performance and cannot reach the 10 mAcm <sup>2</sup> current density in the studied potential range. To confirm the synergistic effect within the POM-derived PBA@Co W O S, a Co W O S/CC electrode was prepared by sulfurizing the POM precursor following the same protocol. In addition, the synthesized POM and WS2 were also grown on CC as control samples. The polarization curves of these reference samples also shown in Figure 4a illustrate the preferable OER performance of the PBA@Co W O S heterostructure.

To better understand the origin of the electrocatalytic OER performance improvement of the PBA@Co W O S composite, some intrinsic properties were evaluated, including impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and electrochemical active surface area (ESCA). The EIS results (Figure 4c) fitted by a simplified equivalent circuit (Figure S5) show that the hybrid PBA@Co W O S has a much smaller charge transfer resistance (Rct) in comparison with all other tested catalysts. This fact suggests an improvement in the electron-transfer properties of the hybrid structure, which is essential for boosting the multielectron OER process. Then, we compared the electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) of the catalysts, estimated from their double-layer capacitance (*C*dl) derived from cyclic voltammetry at various scan rates (Figure S6a–d).[47,48] The PBA@Co W O S/CC catalyst shows the highest ECSA with a value of 20.4 mFcm <sup>2</sup> , about 5 and 7-fold higher than PBA/CC and Co W O S/CC, respectively (Figure S6e). The larger ECSA indicates more exposed active sites in the hybrid structure, thus accelerating the catalytic reaction.

The exceptional electrocatalytic performance of the PBA@Co W O S/CC heterostructure led us to test its longterm stability. Chronoamperometric measurement was carried out for 24 h, where no significant change in activity could be observed in the catalyst at a current density of 10 mAcm <sup>2</sup> , Figure 4d. In addition, the stability of the catalyst was confirmed after performing 1000 continuous CV cycles in 1.0 M KOH, showing no change in the LSV and EIS curves (Figures 4d and S8, respectively). Moreover, the morphology of the catalyst after 24 h of OER was tested, and no noticeable change of the heterostructure was observed (Figure S7), making it durable, promise, and inexpensive OER electrocatalyst; see Table S3 for comparison with recently reported non-precious metal catalysts for OER in alkaline media.

### **4. Conclusions**

In summary, we have developed a novel approach to fabricate a hybrid structure of PBA cubes wrapped with W Co oxysulfide hair-like structures derived from POM as a bimetallic precursor, all together grafted on CC substrate. This unique structure exhibited high electrochemically active surface area and improved charge transfer kinetics that facilitate enhanced catalytic activity towards the sluggish OER (overpotential of 250 mV at 10 mAcm <sup>2</sup> ). We attribute the superior electrocatalytic activity of the PBA@Co W O S/CC catalyst to the enhanced intrinsic catalytic activity of the transition metal oxysulfides sites. The synergistic effect of the heterostructure, defect abundancy, and improved charge transfer with the 3D carbon cloth ensure solid structural stability and good electrical conductivity. The synthetic approach used in this study can be extended for developing non-precious and efficient catalysts with diverse structures.

The sluggish kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) restrict the efficiencies of renewable energy storage and conversion methods, including water splitting and metal-air batteries. Owing to their abundant misaligned atoms and sub-nanometer sizes, metal oxide/ oxyhydroxide clusters supported by good electric conductors are supposed to have superior electrocatalytic activity toward the OER. Herein, highly efficient oxygen evolution catalysis is achieved using NiFe oxyhydroxide clusters anchored on carbon black (NiFeoxyhydroxide/C). To reach a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, the NiFe-oxyhydroxide/C sample with a Ni/Fe molar ratio of 1:1 (Ni<sub>0.5</sub>Fe<sub>0.5</sub>/C) only needs an overpotential of 269.6 mV, which is much smaller than those of amorphous NiFe-oxyhydroxide particles (347.9 mV) and commercial RuO<sub>2</sub> (423.3 mV). In particular, the mass activity of Ni<sub>0.5</sub>Fe<sub>0.5</sub>/C can reach 593.1 A g<sup>-1</sup> at a very low overpotential of 320 mV. Experimental characterizations and theoretical calculations indicate that the existence of Ni-O-Fe structures in NiFeoxyhydroxide/C accounts for its excellent OER activity. Our findings not only provide a novel avenue for the preparation of excellent OER electrocatalysts but they also deepen our understanding of the catalytic mechanisms of NiFe-based OER electrocatalysts.

The oxygen evolution reaction (OER), as a key half-reaction in water splitting and rechargeable metal-air batteries, limits the overall conversion efficiency between electrical and chemical energy.<sup>1-3</sup> In order to promote sluggish electron-transfer kinetics, highly efficient OER electrocatalysts have been developed to reduce kinetic energy barriers.<sup>4-6</sup> At present, the state-

has been found that the surfaces of most metal oxides convert into amorphous states through self-reconstruction at the anodic potential in alkaline media. Hence, the real active materials toward OER should be amorphous phases instead of crystalline ones, which has been verified in several previous works. Pro instance, Driess et al. have demonstrated that amorphous cobalt iron oxides have higher OER activity than their crystalline counterparts. Moreover, amorphous materials are only ordered in short range and thus have abundant micro and macro defects, which are beneficial for electrochemical activation. For example, Yu et al. have shown that amorphous NiFeMo oxides exhibit rapid surface reconstruction to form

active metal oxy(hydroxide) layer compared with crystalline

ones and thus exhibit superior OER activity.26 Liu et al. have

demonstrated that, owing to the short-range order of the

amorphous structure, amorphous NiFe alloy can produce more

abundant active sites for OER than the crystalline form.27

Although superior OER performances have been realized with

amorphous metal oxides, their ultralow electric conductivity

limits the further improvement of OER performance.<sup>28</sup>

Compared with bulk amorphous materials or large amorphous particles, metal oxide/oxyhydroxide clusters supported by good electric conductors can overcome the electric conductivity limit. More importantly, metal oxide/oxyhydroxide clusters have abundant misaligned atoms, which is similar to amorphous structures. In addition, metal oxide/oxyhydroxide clusters have sub-nanometer sizes. These two features make metal oxide/oxyhydroxide clusters easily activated at anodic potential in alkaline solution. Therefore, it can be predicted that metal

oxide/oxyhydroxide clusters supported by good electric conductors should be excellent OER electrocatalysts. On the basis of this supposition, we prepared nickel iron oxyhydroxide clusters supported by carbon black (NiFe-oxyhydroxide/C) for OER catalysis. The NiFe-oxyhydroxide/C electrocatalysts are prepared through the hydrolysis of metal salts in the presence of carbon black at alkaline condition, followed by freeze drying. Owing to its very large specific surface area, carbon black can provide sufficient sites for the adsorption of NiFe-oxyhydroxide clusters formed during hydrolysis, and thus effectively prevent the aggregation of clusters into large particles. The carbon black also endows the electrocatalysts with good electric conductivity. The best OER activity is obtained on the NiFe-oxyhydroxide/C sample with Ni/Fe molar ratio of one (Ni<sub>0.5</sub>Fe<sub>0.5</sub>/C). To reach a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, Ni<sub>0.5</sub>Fe<sub>0.5</sub>/C only needs an overpotential of 269.6 mV, which is much smaller than those of amorphous NiFe-oxyhydroxide particles (347.9 mV) and commercial RuO<sub>2</sub> (423.3 mV). Particularly, Ni<sub>0.5</sub>Fe<sub>0.5</sub>/C exhibits a very high mass activity of 593.1 A g<sup>-1</sup> at an overpotential of 320 mV. Experimental characterizations and theoretical calculations indicate that the existence of Ni-O-Fe structures in NiFe-oxyhydroxide/C accounts for the excellent OER activity.

The NiFe-oxyhydroxide/C catalysts are prepared through the hydrolysis of NiCl<sub>2</sub> and FeCl<sub>3</sub> in alkaline solution in the presence of carbon black, followed by freeze drying (Fig. 1A). Owing to the very large specific surface area, carbon black can adsorb in a timely manner the NiFe-hydroxide clusters formed during hydrolysis, thus preventing the further growth or aggregation of the clusters into large particles. The other reason for choosing carbon black as support is its excellent inherent electric conductivity which can promote electron transfer during electrocatalysis. For comparison, the crystalline counterpart, denoted as C-Ni<sub>0.5</sub>Fe<sub>0.5</sub>/C, was obtained through annealing the Ni<sub>0.5</sub>Fe<sub>0.5</sub>/C sample in inert atmosphere. Amorphous NiFeoxyhydroxide particles (Ni<sub>0.5</sub>Fe<sub>0.5</sub>) were also prepared through a similar process in the absence of carbon black.

The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern displays that the obtained Ni<sub>0.5</sub>Fe<sub>0.5</sub>/C sample only has three very weak and broad peaks at  $21.6^{\circ}$ ,  $34.4^{\circ}$  and  $60.6^{\circ}$  (Fig. 1B). The peak at  $21.6^{\circ}$  is attributed to the diffraction from carbon black. The other two peaks do not match the diffraction from either NiO or Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. Because of their sub-nanometer size and higher atomic disorders, clusters usually have very weak and broad diffraction peaks in XRD patterns.29 We therefore attribute these two peaks to NiFe-oxyhydroxide clusters. The XRD pattern of the  $\mathrm{Ni}_{0.5}\mathrm{Fe}_{0.5}$ sample is similar to that of Ni<sub>0.5</sub>Fe<sub>0.5</sub>/C, signifying its amorphous feature. After annealing treatment, the Ni<sub>0.5</sub>Fe<sub>0.5</sub>/C converts into mixed crystallized phases composed of Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and NiO, which is reflected by the good match of XRD peaks with those of Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> (JCPDS no. 39-1346) and NiO (JCPDS no. 47-1049) (Fig. 1B). In comparison with carbon black, the specific surface area of Ni<sub>0.5</sub>Fe<sub>0.5</sub>/C is greatly reduced to 292.5 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup> due to the adsorption of NiFe-oxyhydroxide clusters (Fig. S1†). Although the specific surface area is significantly reduced, the microporous and mesoporous features of carbon black are kept in Ni<sub>0.5</sub>Fe<sub>0.5</sub>/C, which is beneficial to mass transport during electrocatalysis.

Ni<sub>0.5</sub>Fe<sub>0.5</sub>/C keeps the morphology of carbon black, reflected by the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images (Fig. 1C and S2†). No particles are observed in the low-magnification TEM and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images of Ni<sub>0.5</sub>Fe<sub>0.5</sub>/ C (Fig. 1C and D), indicating that the NiFe-oxyhydroxides should exist as clusters. Similar to XRD results, the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of Ni<sub>0.5</sub>Fe<sub>0.5</sub>/C does not show diffraction spots or rings, further confirming the amorphous structure of NiFe-oxyhydroxides. The high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) image clearly shows that the NiFe-oxyhydroxides exist as clusters (Fig. 1E). The elemental mapping images obtained from energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analysis show that Fe and Ni are uniformly distributed over the entire sample (Fig. 1F). No distinct difference can be found from the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of Ni<sub>0.5</sub>Fe<sub>0.5</sub>/C and C-Ni<sub>0.5</sub>Fe<sub>0.5</sub>/C (Fig. S3†), but nanoparticles can be clearly observed in the TEM image of C-Ni<sub>0.5</sub>Fe<sub>0.5</sub>/C (Fig. S4†). Further, HRTEM and corresponding Fourier transform (FT) image show that the large nanoparticles are Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. These results are consistent with the XRD characterizations that diffractions from Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and NiO are observed. Without the support of carbon black, the aggregation of Ni<sub>0.5</sub>Fe<sub>0.5</sub> is very severe and its electric conductivity is significantly smaller than that of Ni<sub>0.5</sub>Fe<sub>0.5</sub>/C (Fig. S5 and S6†). In addition, NiFe-oxyhydroxide/C with other Ni/Fe ratios, including Ni<sub>0.3</sub>Fe<sub>0.7</sub>/C and Ni<sub>0.7</sub>Fe<sub>0.3</sub>/C, were also prepared. They have morphologies and XRD patterns similar to those of  $Ni_{0.5}Fe_{0.5}/C$  (Fig. S7 and S8†).

The chemical composition and states of Ni<sub>0.5</sub>Fe<sub>0.5</sub>/C were investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The wide-scan XPS spectrum shows the existence of Ni, Fe, C, and O elements in Ni<sub>0.5</sub>Fe<sub>0.5</sub>/C (Fig. S9A†). The high-resolution Ni 2p XPS spectrum has two main peaks and two accompanying satellite peaks (Fig. S9B†). The two main peaks are located at 874.3 and 856.8 eV, which correspond to  $2p_{1/2}$  and  $2p_{3/2}$  of divalent Ni, respectively.30 The Fe 2p spectrum has two main peaks at 726.1 eV  $(2p_{1/2})$  and 712.4 eV  $(2p_{3/2})$  with a separation of 13.7 eV (Fig. S9C†), indicating that Fe exists as trivalent state. 31,32 Three peaks are observed in the O 1s spectrum (Fig. S9D†). The peak at lower energy of 530.2 eV is ascribed to oxygen bound with two metal atoms, the main peak at 532.2 eV is attributed to oxygen of hydroxyl in NiFe-oxyhydroxides,33,34 and the higher energy peak should arise from oxygen species adsorbed on carbon black. In addition, three peaks of C-C (284.8 eV), C-O-C (285.95 eV), and O-C=O (287.2 eV) make up the C 1s spectrum (Fig. S9E†).35,36

X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) analyses were further performed on the prepared amorphous catalysts to elucidate the local coordination structure and valence states of Ni and Fe.37,38 The Fe X-ray absorption edges of all amorphous NiFeoxyhydroxides/C catalysts are overlapped with those of FeOOH and Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> (Fig. 2A and S10A†), indicating that Fe exists as trivalent state in all prepared amorphous NiFe-oxyhydroxide/C samples. The high-valence-state Fe cations can promote the kinetic process of OER. 39,40 The corresponding FT  $k^3$ -weighted EXAFS spectra of Fe in the prepared amorphous NiFe-

oxyhydroxide/C catalysts and references are given in Fig. 2B and S10B.† We can find from Fig. S10B† that Ni<sub>0.5</sub>Fe<sub>0.5</sub>/C has two peaks overlapped with those of FeOOH. In contrast, besides these two peaks, Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> also has another strong peak at large R. These results definitely indicate that Fe exists as oxyhydroxide instead of Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. Moreover, with the increase of Ni/Fe molar ratio, the two peaks exhibit shifts toward large R (Fig. 2B), signifying that Fe does not exist as pure FeOOH but as NiFeoxyhydroxides (having Ni-O-Fe structure). Because Ni2+ ions have larger size than Fe<sup>3+</sup> ions, the substitution of Fe<sup>3+</sup> with Ni<sup>2+</sup> increases the metal-oxygen and metal-metal distances and thus leads to the shift of the two peaks in EXAFS spectra toward large R. Considering that wavelet transform (WT) of EXAFS oscillations has powerful resolutions in both k and R spaces, <sup>41,42</sup> we further carried out WT of Fe K-edge EXAFS on the prepared amorphous NiFe-oxyhydroxide/C catalysts to more clearly show their structures. The WTs of all prepared NiFe-oxyhydroxide/C exhibit similar variations to that of FeOOH in both k and Rspaces, but are clearly different from those of other references, including Fe, FeO, and Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> (Fig. 2C, D and S11†).

Ni K-edge XANES spectra of the prepared amorphous NiFe-oxyhydroxide/C samples and various other samples are shown

in Fig. 2E and S12A.† All amorphous NiFe-oxyhydroxide/C catalysts have the same Ni X-ray absorption edges as Ni(OH)2 and NiO, indicating that Ni exists as divalent ions. This result is consistent with the XPS characterizations. The Ni<sub>0.7</sub>Fe<sub>0.3</sub>/C and  $Ni_{0.5}Fe_{0.5}/C$  samples have similar FT  $k^3$ -weighted EXAFS Ni spectra to that of Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> (Fig. 2F), but they are clearly different from that of NiO (Fig. S12B†). This indicates that Ni<sub>0.7</sub>Fe<sub>0.3</sub>/C and Ni<sub>0.5</sub>Fe<sub>0.5</sub>/C have Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> structure instead of NiO structure. Besides the three peaks close to those of Ni(OH)2, the  $Ni_{0.7}Fe_{0.3}/C$  catalyst also has a peak at  $\sim$ 2.18 Å (Fig. 2F). In addition, the main FT  $k^3$ -weighted EXAFS peaks of Ni in amorphous NiFe-oxyhydroxide/C catalysts exhibit a shift with the variation of Ni/Fe molar ratio. These variations further indicate the existence of Ni-O-Fe structure in the amorphous NiFeoxyhydroxide/C catalysts. The WTs of Ni in all prepared NiFeoxyhydroxide/C exhibit similar variations to that of Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> in both k and R spaces, but are clearly different from those of Ni and NiO (Fig. 2G, H and S13†).

The OER performances of Ni<sub>0.5</sub>Fe<sub>0.5</sub>/C, Ni<sub>0.5</sub>Fe<sub>0.5</sub>, and C-Ni<sub>0.5</sub>Fe<sub>0.5</sub>/C were investigated in Ar-saturated 1 M KOH electrolyte at room temperature.

 $Ni_{0.5}Fe_{0.5}/C$  as well as of RuO<sub>2</sub>. The  $Ni_{0.5}Fe_{0.5}/C$  catalyst exhibits an overpotential of 269.6 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, which is much smaller than those of amorphous Ni<sub>0.5</sub>Fe<sub>0.5</sub> (347.9 mV), C-Ni<sub>0.5</sub>Fe<sub>0.5</sub>/C (370.4 mV), and RuO<sub>2</sub> (423.3 mV). Particularly, the overpotential of Ni<sub>0.5</sub>Fe<sub>0.5</sub>/C for reaching 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> can rival the values obtained for most reported transition metal-based OER catalysts, including amorphous NiFeMo oxides (280 mV),26 electrochemically activated co-adsorbed Co and Fe ions on carbon black (295 mV),43 Ni-Fe LDH hollow prisms (280 mV),44 and Mn-Co oxyphosphides (320 mV).45 The OER kinetics for different catalysts is reflected by the Tafel slopes which are derived from the relationship between the overpotential and current density.46 The much smaller Tafel slope of  $Ni_{0.5}Fe_{0.5}/C$  (40.43 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>) compared with  $Ni_{0.5}Fe_{0.5}$  $(72.65 \text{ mV dec}^{-1})$ , C-Ni<sub>0.5</sub>Fe<sub>0.5</sub>/C (55.3 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>), and RuO<sub>2</sub> (109.33 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>) indicates the much faster kinetics of OER on Ni<sub>0.5</sub>Fe<sub>0.5</sub>/C (Fig. 3B). These results are evidence that the NiFeoxyhydroxide clusters supported by carbon black have higher OER activity than amorphous NiFe-oxyhydroxide particles and the crystalline counterpart. Moreover, the activation energies of OER on different catalysts are determined from the reaction taking place at different temperatures (Fig. S14†).47 The obtained activation energy of OER on Ni<sub>0.5</sub>Fe<sub>0.5</sub>/C (19.21 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>) is about half of that on C-Ni<sub>0.5</sub>Fe<sub>0.5</sub>/C (38.21 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>), further signifying the faster kinetics of OER on Ni<sub>0.5</sub>Fe<sub>0.5</sub>/C.<sup>48</sup>

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy is performed at an overpotential of 280 mV to study the interfacial properties of the electrocatalysts. Fig. 3D shows the Nyquist plots of impedances which were fitted with the equivalent circuit shown in Fig. S15.† The charge transfer resistance ( $R_{\rm ct}$ ) of Ni<sub>0.5</sub>Fe<sub>0.5</sub>/C (3.16  $\Omega$ ) is two orders of magnitude smaller than those of  $Ni_{0.5}Fe_{0.5}$  (107.5  $\Omega$ ), C-Ni<sub>0.5</sub>Fe<sub>0.5</sub>/C (326.0  $\Omega$ ), and RuO<sub>2</sub> (239.5  $\Omega$ ), suggesting extremely fast charge transfer kinetics on Ni<sub>0.5</sub>Fe<sub>0.5</sub>/C.49 The significant reduction of R<sub>ct</sub> in Ni<sub>0.5</sub>Fe<sub>0.5</sub>/C is owing to its very high intrinsic activity and high electric conductivity. The electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) was obtained through measuring double-layer capacitance ( $C_{\rm dl}$ ) (Fig. S16†). The  $C_{\rm dl}$ values of  $Ni_{0.5}Fe_{0.5}/C$ ,  $Ni_{0.5}Fe_{0.5}$ , C- $Ni_{0.5}Fe_{0.5}/C$  and  $RuO_2$  are 32.61, 1.71, 3.99, and 1.07 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>, respectively (Fig. S16E†).  $C_{\rm dl}$  is further converted into ECSA by dividing by the specific capacitance.<sup>51</sup> The obtained ECSA of Ni<sub>0.5</sub>Fe<sub>0.5</sub>/C is 815.3 cm<sup>2</sup>, which significantly larger than those of Ni<sub>0.5</sub>Fe<sub>0.5</sub> (42.8 cm<sup>2</sup>), C-Ni<sub>0.5</sub>Fe<sub>0.5</sub>/C (99.8 cm<sup>2</sup>), and RuO<sub>2</sub> (26.8 cm<sup>2</sup>) (Fig. 3E). Hence, Ni<sub>0.5</sub>Fe<sub>0.5</sub>/C has more abundant active sites for OER than the amorphous Ni<sub>0.5</sub>Fe<sub>0.5</sub> and crystalline C-Ni<sub>0.5</sub>Fe<sub>0.5</sub>/C, which can be understood by the fact that the crystallization process reduces the number of active sites and specific surface area of C-Ni<sub>0.5</sub>Fe<sub>0.5</sub>/C and the bulk nature of Ni<sub>0.5</sub>Fe<sub>0.5</sub> leads to a small specific surface area and few exposed active sites. We further normalized the electrochemical current with the ECSA to obtain

the intrinsic activity (Fig. S17†). At small overpotential, Ni<sub>0.5</sub>Fe<sub>0.5</sub>/C also has larger ECSA-normalized current density than Ni<sub>0.5</sub>Fe<sub>0.5</sub>, C-Ni<sub>0.5</sub>Fe<sub>0.5</sub>/C, and RuO<sub>2</sub>, evincing that Ni<sub>0.5</sub>Fe<sub>0.5</sub>/C not only has larger ECSA but also has higher intrinsic activity. The high intrinsic activity of each active site of Ni<sub>0.5</sub>Fe<sub>0.5</sub>/C is further reflected by the turnover frequency (TOF) which is determined through an electrochemical method (Fig. S18†).52 At an overpotential of 300 mV, the TOF of Ni<sub>0.5</sub>Fe<sub>0.5</sub>/C electrocatalyst can reach 8.14 s<sup>-1</sup>, which exceeds those of most recently reported OER electrocatalysts, such as NiFe-LDH/CNTs of  $0.56~{\rm s}^{-1}$  at an overpotential of 300 mV,  $^{53}$ Co<sub>0.7</sub>Fe<sub>0.3</sub>CB of 0.52 s<sup>-1</sup> at an overpotential of 370 mV,<sup>43</sup> Fe<sub>0.33</sub>Co<sub>0.67</sub>OOHPNSAs/CFC of 0.0142 s<sup>-1</sup> at an overpotential of 300 mV,  $^{54}$  and Ni $_{0.75}$ V $_{0.25}$ -LDH of 0.054 s $^{-1}$  at an overpotential of 350 mV.55 Fig. 3F shows the mass activity of these catalysts. At an overpotential of 320 mV, Ni<sub>0.5</sub>Fe<sub>0.5</sub>/C exhibits a mass activity of 593.1 A  $g^{-1}$ , which is 25 times of that of Ni<sub>0.5</sub>Fe<sub>0.5</sub> (23.6 A  $g^{-1}$ ) and two orders of magnitude larger than those of C-Ni<sub>0.5</sub>Fe<sub>0.5</sub>/C and RuO<sub>2</sub>, indicating the high catalytic activity of NiFeoxyhydroxide/C for OER. Moreover, we also studied the variation of OER performance of NiFe-oxyhydroxide/C with respect to the Ni/Fe ratios (Fig. S19†). Ni<sub>0.5</sub>Fe<sub>0.5</sub>/C displays a smaller overpotential and Tafel slope compared with Ni<sub>0.3</sub>Fe<sub>0.7</sub>/C and Ni<sub>0.7</sub>Fe<sub>0.3</sub>/C catalysts. This indicates that the Ni/Fe ratio plays an

important role for NiFe-oxyhydroxide/C to realize superior OER performance.

Table S1† summarizes the OER performances of Ni- or Febased electrocatalysts from previous research. Although very small overpotentials have been achieved with catalysts supported on nickel foam, the catalyst loading amounts are normally relatively large because of the porous structure of nickel foam. Among the reported catalysts supported on glassy carbon, our prepared Ni<sub>0.5</sub>Fe<sub>0.5</sub>/C catalyst has the lowest overpotential at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> even through the catalyst loading is rather small. To determine whether hydrogen peroxide is produced during the OER process, LSV measurement is carried out with a rotating ring-disk electrode. Nearly zero current density is obtained on the ring electrode (Fig. S20†), indicating an ideal four-electron pathway for OER.

To avoid the potential physical loss of active materials on glassy carbon during high-speed rotation, the Ni $_{0.5}$ Fe $_{0.5}$ /C catalyst was cast on hydrophilic carbon cloth as working electrode for stability tests. To assess the stability of the Ni $_{0.5}$ Fe $_{0.5}$ /C catalyst, consecutive CV scans were carried out. After 1000 cycles, the Ni $_{0.5}$ Fe $_{0.5}$ /C catalyst shows a negligible decay of OER performance (Fig. S21A†). To evaluate the long-term stability, chronopotentiometry measurement was carried out on the Ni $_{0.5}$ Fe $_{0.5}$ /C catalyst at 1.512 V  $\nu s$ . RHE (Fig. S21B†). Although the current density exhibits a clear decrease during the first two

hours, it shows only slight degradation in the following ten hours. XRD and TEM characterizations show no observable change of the Ni<sub>0.5</sub>Fe<sub>0.5</sub>/catalyst after stability measurement (Fig. S22 and S23†). These results suggest that Ni<sub>0.5</sub>Fe<sub>0.5</sub>/C is rather stable toward OER. In addition, Ni<sub>0.5</sub>Fe<sub>0.5</sub>/C also shows excellent OER performance in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte, with an overpotential of 300 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, while in such diluted electrolyte commercial RuO2 basically has no electrocatalytic activity for OER (Fig. S24 and S25†).

To investigate the electrocatalytic mechanism, several control experiments were carried out on Ni<sub>0.5</sub>Fe<sub>0.5</sub> mixed physically with carbon black, pure Ni-oxyhydroxide/C (Ni-OH/C), and pure Fe-oxyhydroxide/C (Fe-OH/C). The Ni-OH/C and Fe-OH/C were prepared through a similar process only with NiCl<sub>2</sub> or FeCl<sub>3</sub>. Although several weak and broad diffraction peaks are observed in the XRD pattern of Ni-OH/C (Fig. S26†), they did not match with the diffractions from Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>. Hence, Ni-OH/C should be composed of Ni-oxyhydroxide clusters. Fe-OH/C shows an XRD pattern similar to that of Ni<sub>0.5</sub>Fe<sub>0.5</sub>/C (Fig. S26†), indicating that Fe in Fe-OH/C exists as Feoxyhydroxide clusters. The SEM images show that Ni-OH/C and Fe-OH/C have morphology similar to that of Ni<sub>0.5</sub>Fe<sub>0.5</sub>/C (Fig. S27†). Fig. S28-S30† show the OER performance of different control catalysts. In comparison with Ni-OH/C and Fe-OH/C catalysts, Ni<sub>0.5</sub>Fe<sub>0.5</sub>/C displays a smaller overpotential and Tafel slope. This indicates that both Ni and Fe centers in NiFe-oxyhydroxide/C take part in the catalytic process. Ni<sub>0.5</sub>Fe<sub>0.5</sub>

and the physical mixture of Ni<sub>0.5</sub>Fe<sub>0.5</sub> and carbon black show similar OER performance, but their performances are much poorer than that of Ni<sub>0.5</sub>Fe<sub>0.5</sub>/C. This is because carbon black not only enhances the electric conductivity but also prevents the aggregation of NiFe-oxyhydroxide clusters into large particles. The latter endows Ni<sub>0.5</sub>Fe<sub>0.5</sub>/C with more abundant active sites for OER, and therefore superior OER performance is realized for  $Ni_{0.5}Fe_{0.5}/C$ .

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were further employed to study the OER process on Ni<sub>0.5</sub>Fe<sub>0.5</sub>/C at the atomic level. For comparison, calculations for Ni-OH/C and Fe-OH/C were also conducted. According to the EXAFS analysis, Ni-O-Fe structures exist in NiFe-oxyhydroxide/C catalysts. Hence, Ni<sub>0.5</sub>Fe<sub>0.5</sub>/C is modeled with a cluster containing two Ni and two Fe atoms which are bonded through Ni-O-Fe structure (Fig. 4). The free energy diagrams of the OER process on Ni<sub>0.5</sub>Fe<sub>0.5</sub>/C, Ni-OH/C, and Fe-OH/C catalysts are shown in Fig. S31.† The rate-determining step of OER on Fe-OH/C and Ni<sub>0.5</sub>Fe<sub>0.5</sub>/C is the oxidation of OH<sup>-</sup> to \*OH, while it is the oxidation of \*OH to \*O on Ni-OH/C. The uphill energies of the rate-determining step on Ni<sub>0.5</sub>Fe<sub>0.5</sub>/C is 1.88 eV, which is smaller than those on Fe-OH/C (2.84 eV) and Ni-OH/C (2.04 eV). This is consistent with the experimental result that Ni<sub>0.5</sub>Fe<sub>0.5</sub>/C has smaller overpotential for OER compared with Fe-OH/C and Ni-OH/C. The free energy diagrams of OER on Ni<sub>0.5</sub>Fe<sub>0.5</sub>/C at different potentials are also shown in Fig. 4. It can be found that the OER process can take place spontaneously on Ni<sub>0.5</sub>Fe<sub>0.5</sub>/C at relatively low overpotential. From the adsorption configurations of involved species (Fig. 4 and S32†), we can find that both Ni and Fe centers take part in the catalytic OER process. Specifically, the adsorption of \*OH at the bridge of Ni and Fe in Ni $_{0.5}$ Fe $_{0.5}$ /C gives rise to a transient adsorption which is weaker than that on Ni–OH/C but stronger than that on Fe–OH/C. The very strong adsorption of \*OH on Ni–OH/C give rise to small uphill energy for the oxidation of OH $^-$  to \*OH, but leads to very large uphill energy for the oxidation of \*OH to \*O. In contrast, the very weak adsorption of \*OH on Fe–OH/C results in very large uphill energy for the oxidation of OH $^-$  to \*OH. The transient adsorption of \*OH on Ni $_{0.5}$ Fe $_{0.5}$ /C reduces the uphill energies of these two steps and thus optimizes the OER performance.

#### Conclusions

In summary, a highly efficient OER electrocatalyst, consisting of carbon black-supported NiFe-oxyhydroxide clusters, is prepared through the hydrolysis of nickel and iron salts in the presence of carbon black under alkaline conditions. The presence of carbon black not only endows the prepared catalyst with excellent electric conductivity, but it also effectively prevents the aggregation of NiFe-oxyhydroxide clusters into large particles, which leads to the superior electrocatalytic OER activity of the NiFeoxyhydroxide/C catalyst. A very small overpotential of 269.6 mV is needed for Ni<sub>0.5</sub>Fe<sub>0.5</sub>/C to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. In particular, Ni<sub>0.5</sub>Fe<sub>0.5</sub>/C exhibits very high mass activity of 593.1 A g<sup>-1</sup> at an overpotential of 320 mV. EXAFS characterization shows the existence of Ni-O-Fe structures in NiFe-oxyhydroxide/C. Theoretical calculations indicate that the Ni-O-Fe structures give rise to a transient adsorption energy of \*OH on Ni<sub>0.5</sub>Fe<sub>0.5</sub>/C, which optimizes the OER catalytic activity. Our findings not only provide a novel avenue for the preparation of excellent OER electrocatalysts, but they also deepen our understanding of the catalytic mechanisms of NiFebased OER electrocatalysts.

The development of efficient electrocatalysts towards oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is critical for large-scale applications of electrochemical water splitting and metal-air cells. Usually, transition metal alloys exhibit superior activity for OER. Herein, we successfully prepared a series of scalable transition metal alloys with homogeneous size by a facial sol-gel self-propagating combustion method. Among them, the CoFe alloy

displayed the highest oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity, achieving an overpotential of 310 mV at 10 mAcm <sup>2</sup> . After running OER tests for 48 h, the activity of CoFe alloy hardly decayed, indicating its outstanding stability. This work may make some contributions to the production of promising transition metal alloy catalysts and related energy equipment applications.

# **Introduction**

With the intensification of fossil energy shortage issues, developing of renewable energy is imperative. Therefore, it is highly desired to explore efficient energy storage and conversion equipment.[1–7] Among various energy technologies, rechargeable metal-air batteries and electrochemical water splitting are being studied extensively due to their high conversion efficiency and environmental friendliness.[8–14] The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is the key electrode reaction of the above two energy devices. However, the slow OER kinetics largely hinders their practical application. To accelerate OER, high-efficiency electrocatalysts are required. Hitherto, the Ir-/Ru-based metal oxides are considered the benchmark electrocatalysts for OER. Unfortunately, high cost and resource scarcity have restricted their large-scale applications.[15–19] Consequently, the search for inexpensive and high-performance OER electrocatalysts is inevitable for advanced energy devices, but challenging.[20–22]

Recently, much work has been done to develop highefficient and low-cost OER electrocatalysts.[23–27] The 3d transition metal-based materials (such as transition metal oxides, hydroxide and phosphides) were widely explored for OER due to the outstanding OER properties of transition metal elements.[28–31] However, their OER electrocatalytic activity was greatly limited by their relatively poor conductivity and high impedance. To solve this problem, the un-doped 3d transition metal alloys (such as CoNi, FeNi and CoFe) are emerging as the promising catalysts for their abundance, binary active metal sites, good electronic conductivity and unique electronic structures.[30,32] Compared with single metal catalysts, transition metal alloys have better OER activity due to the synergy between transition metal elements and the strain effect of crystal structure, which can regulate the electronic structure of the alloys.[33,34] Improving the stability of alloy catalysts is a current challenge owing to the easy corrosion of alloys in alkaline medium, which prevents the true OER properties of alloys from being revealed. Therefore, facial and suitable methods are necessary to develop for the synthesis of highly stable and active alloy catalysts toward OER. Currently, various methods, including chemical reduction method,[22] chemical vapor deposition,[35] high-energy ball milling and electrodeposition,[26,36,37] have been reported to synthesize the 3d transition metal alloys. All of those reported strategies are subject to tedious procedures, sensitive synthesis conditions and high energy consumption, which makes scale-up production of transition metal alloys relatively difficult. Furthermore, under high temperature conditions, transition metal alloy nanoparticles are quite easy to aggregate and some even transform into bulk materials, which largely restricts the material utilization and electrocatalytic performance. Therefore, it is imperative to use a simple and productive strategy for scalable synthesis of transition metal alloy catalysts with high

The sol-gel self-propagating combustion method is a wellestablished strategy for the large-scale synthesis of ultrafine metal oxide powders.[38–41] It takes advantage of the huge thermal energy released by the chemical reaction to suddenly increase the temperature of the adjacent material for triggering new chemical reaction, which quickly spreads to the entire reactant in the form of a combustion wave.[42,43] It is common that material synthesized by a sol-gel approach is exposed to a calcination step to decompose residual organic material from the synthesis. Whereas, the high temperature calcination step would consume energy and lead to the agglomeration of particles. Therefore, in this work, we avoid the high temperature calcination step to make the alloys particles more

uniform. It was found that no impurity was detected in XRD characterization of the prepared samples. The agglomeration of particles was also avoided, which was confirmed by SEM and TEM analysis. Furthermore, the other methods to prepare the homogeneous 3d transition alloys always involve the high temperature or complicated process.[42,44] Consequently, the sol-gel self-propagating combustion strategy is a relatively rapid and energy-saving method for the synthesis of alloy catalysts. Herein, we synthesized a series of 3d transition metals and their alloys via this simple sol-gel self-propagating combustion strategy. During synthesis process, the homogeneous mixing of metal ions at the atomic level enables a uniform distribution of transition metal elements in the alloy, and the gas trapped in the gel makes the gel loose and porous, which can effectively avoid the aggregation of the resulting transition metal alloy nanoparticles. Among the synthesized 3d transition metals and their alloys, the CoFe alloy displayed the highest activity toward OER. The overpotential achieved 310 mV at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> and the Tafel slope was 64 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>, outperforming most reported noble metal-free alloys OER electrocatalysts. The CoFe alloy exhibited the comparable OER activity to that of commercial RuO2 and faster kinetics than RuO<sub>2</sub>. Additionally, the performance was better than some of the reported noble-metal-based OER catalysts, indicating that CoFe alloy is a promising alternative to noble-metal-based electrocatalysts. [45-48] After testing at 10 and 20 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> for 48 h, the catalyst showed no significant change in potential, demonstrating the outstanding stability of the CoFe alloy. Thus, this work provides an efficient transition metal alloy electrocatalyst for the key OER in related energy devices.

## **Results and Discussion**

As shown in Scheme 1, ultrafine CoFe alloy powder was obtained by combining the sol-gel self-propagating combustion method and the subsequent H<sub>2</sub> reduction process. Firstly, metal ions were complexed with citric acid to form a uniform sol solution. It is worth noting that the pH value of the solution is a key factor in affecting the complexation. When the pH value is too low, there are quite few citrate ions dissociated from the citric acid in the solution, which is not enough to completely complex the metal ions. When the pH value is too high, the metal ions will form precipitations of hydroxide. When the solution is neutral, citric acid can almost completely complex all metal ions in the solution according to the previous reports. [49,50] Thus, the pH value of the solution was regulated to 7 in our case. The sol solution was then transformed into a porous dry gel after drying for several days. Through the selfpropagating combustion of the porous dry gel, loose metal oxide powder was obtained. In the process of self-propagating combustion, nitrate ion is used as oxidant, citric acid as reducing agent, and redox reaction occurs at a certain combustion temperature. When the molar amount of metal nitrate and citric acid is the same and only ideal CO<sub>2</sub> and N<sub>2</sub> are generated in the reaction, the reaction equation between them can be expressed as:

Scheme 1. Schematic illustration of the synthesis process of CoFe alloy.

$$\begin{split} & 2 Fe(NO_3)_3 \cdot 9 H_2 O + 2 Co(NO_3)_2 \cdot 6 H_2 O + 4 \, C_6 H_8 O_7 \cdot H_2 O \\ & \rightarrow Co_2 Fe_2 O_5 + 24 CO_2 + 5 \, N_2 + 50 H_2 O \end{split}$$

Theoretically, when the molar ratio of metal ions to citric acid is 1:1, the degree of polymerization between them reaches maximum, and the resulting sol has the greatest viscosity. Thus, the gas produced is more difficult to escape in the process of drying from sol to gel. Therefore, the more gas will result in the more porous in the dry gel, which is easier to form smaller nanoparticles. But in fact, due to the steric effect of citrate ions, more citric acid is used than metal ions to maximize the degree of polymerization between them. According to the previous studies, the maximum degree of polymerization is achieved when the amount of citric acid is 1.5 times that of metal ions.[51-53] Therefore, we chose this ratio in our work. Finally, the metal oxide powder was reduced in the flowing 5 %H<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub> mixed atmosphere to obtain a homogeneous

To identify the composition and crystal structure of samples, XRD analyses were conducted. As displayed in Figure 1, the obvious peaks at 44.6°, 65.1°, and 82.6° were assigned to the (110), (200), and (211) facets, which matched standard cards for CoFe alloy and Fe. Combined with subsequent TEM analysis, suggesting the successful synthesis of CoFe alloy. XRD characterizations of Fe, Co, Ni, FeNi and CoNi samples were also performed. Results indicated that the corresponding diffraction peaks were matched to their standard cards (Figure S1 and S2).

The size and shape of the as-prepared catalysts was visualized by SEM and TEM images. As illustrated in Figure 2a-

d, the SEM and TEM images indicated the uniform distribution of CoFe alloy nanoparticles, and its average size was about 100 nm. Furthermore, the similar morphology of Fe, Co, Ni, FeNi alloy and CoNi alloy nanoparticles were observed by SEM images (Figure S3 and S4). The elemental mapping results of the CoFe alloy indicated the uniform distribution of Fe and Co elements in the whole alloy nanoparticles (Figure 2e-f). The uniform mixing of Co and Fe elements in CoFe alloy was due to the uniform mixing of metal elements at the atomic level in the sol-gel process. In addition, the formation of small and homogeneous alloy nanoparticles may attribute to the gas trapped in the gel, making it loose and porous, further preventing the metal particles from agglomeration. Compared with alloy nanoparticles synthesized by some other methods reported in the literatures, the alloy nanoparticles synthesized by simple sol-gel self-propagating combustion method were more uniform.<sup>[23,26,54]</sup> The TEM energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) confirmed the existence of Fe and Co elements, and the results showed that the molar ratio was consistent with that of corresponding metal precursors (Figure S5).

To evaluate the chemical state of the elements on the surface of the samples, XPS analyses were performed. As illustrated in Figure 3a, the survey spectra verified the presence of Co and Fe components in CoFe alloy. Figure 3b displayed the Fe 2p XPS spectra. The three characteristic peaks of Fe 2p<sub>3/2</sub> at 706.5, 710.0 and 712.0 eV demonstrated the presence of Fe<sup>0</sup>, Fe<sup>2+</sup> and Fe<sup>3+</sup> in CoFe alloy.<sup>[10,55,56]</sup> In Co 2p XPS spectra, the characteristic peaks at 777.7 and 792.7 eV derived from Co<sup>0</sup> and those at 777.7 and 792.7 eV attributed to Co<sup>2+</sup> (Figure 3c). It's noted that the existence of ionic Fe and Co may be originated from the partial oxidized surface during the XPS operation. In addition, in comparison with that of Fe and Co nanoparticles, the Fe<sup>0</sup> 2p<sub>3/2</sub> and Co<sup>0</sup> 2p<sub>3/2</sub> peak of the CoFe alloy shifted clearly towards the higher and lower binding energy by  $\sim 0.4$  eV and 0.01 eV, respectively. This suggested that the electron in CoFe alloy transferred from Fe to Co. Therefore, the strong interaction between Co and Fe elements in their electronic structures may optimize the adsorption/desorption of the OER intermediates and enhance the OER activity of alloyed nanoparticles, which was confirmed by many studies. [55,57,58] The atomic fraction of Co and Fe elements was clearly shown in Figure 3d, and the molar ratio is close to 1:1 corresponding to the results of XPS elemental analysis.

Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) tests were performed to explore the texture properties of the prepared samples. As illustrated in Figure 4 and Table 1, the BET specific surface area of CoFe alloy was measured to be 3.1467 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>, which was

larger than that of individual Co  $(2.2463 \, m^2 g^{-1})$  and Fe  $(2.6042 \, m^2 g^{-1})$ . The increase in specific surface area of CoFe alloy may result from the more porous gel precursor due to the

combination of the two elements. Furthermore, the CoFe alloy, Co and Fe displayed a relatively similar pore distribution with an average pore size of around 13 nm, which may originate from gases trapped in the sol-gel process (the inset in Figure 4).

The electrocatalytic OER activity of the as-prepared catalysts was evaluated using a typical three-electrode system. As depicted in Figure 5a, the CoFe alloy displayed the lowest overpotential of 310 mV to achieve 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, outperforming those of FeNi alloy (354 mV), CoNi alloy (397 mV), metallic Ni (369 mV), metallic Co (426 mV) and closed to RuO<sub>2</sub> (294 mV). From Figure 5b, CoFe alloy displayed a lower Tafel slope of 64 mV dec<sup>-1</sup> than FeNi alloy (154 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>), CoNi alloy (92 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>), metallic Ni (134 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>), metallic Co (302 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>) and RuO<sub>2</sub> (88 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>), demonstrating a faster OER kinetics. The contrast for the overpotential and Tafel slope of different samples were intuitively shown in Figure 5c. By comparison with the reported non-noble alloy catalysts and Ir-/ Ru-based catalysts (Figure 5d and Table 2), the CoFe alloy in our work manifested superior OER activity. This attributed to the homogeneous mixing of metallic elements at the atomic

level in the sol-gel process, and the effective synergy of Fe and Co elements.

The kinetics of mass/charge transfer and electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) of the catalysts are important factors that affecting the electron transfer rate and the exposed active sites of the catalysts.<sup>[59,60]</sup> As shown in Figure 5e, electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were conducted to measure the electron transfer rate of the catalysts. Results indicated the metallic Co, Fe and Ni displayed lower impedance resistance than CoFe, FeNi and CoNi alloy, which consistent with the literatures. This demonstrated that electron conductivity may not be the most critical factor in catalyst activity. In addition, the ECSA of the catalysts was studied by the C<sub>dl</sub> via the CV curves in Figure S6. Results indicated that the metal Co, Fe, and Ni showed higher C<sub>dl</sub> values than CoFe, FeNi, and CoNi alloys, which was consistent with the trend of EIS (Figure 5f). The eventual activity exhibited by a catalyst is controlled by multiple factors, including internal properties, electronic conductivity, active surface area, and synergy between different components. The above experimental results implied that the high activity of CoFe alloy may be mainly attributed to its internal properties and synergistic effect between Co and Fe elements.

Long-term stability and durability are critical criteria for evaluating the performance of the catalysts. After 2000 CV cycles, the LSV curve of CoFe alloy almost coincided with the initial one, which indicated the superior cycling stability of CoFe alloy (Figure 5g). Furthermore, the durability of CoFe alloy was studied by the potential changes after running the OER test for 48 h at 10 and 20 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. As displayed in Figure 4h, the potential of the CoFe alloy hardly changed after durability tests. The LSV curves after stability tests also displayed a very slight decay in the activity of the catalyst, suggesting the outstanding stability of the CoFe alloy (Figure S7). More importantly, the morphology of CoFe alloy after durability test remained the same with that of the primary (inset in Figure 5h

and Figure S8), further demonstrating the excellent long-term durability of CoFe alloy.

Through further reflecting on how OER occurs on the surface of CoFe alloy, the possible reaction mechanisms are proposed in Figure 6. The OER is a four-electron process steps in of four elementary consisting alkaline environment.  $^{\rm [61-65]}$  In the first step, the  ${\rm OH^-}$  loses an electron to become HO\* intermediate at metal active site (OH $^-\rightarrow$ HO\*+e $^-$ ). In the second step, the formed HO\* interacts with another OH<sup>-</sup>, the O\* intermediate is formed with the losing of an electron and a water molecule (HO\*+OH $^ \rightarrow$ H $_2$ O+e $^-$ +O\*). In the third step, the O\* intermediate reacts with a third OH-, the HOO\* intermediate is obtained with the loss of an electron (O\*+  $OH^- \rightarrow e^- + HOO^*$ ). In the final step, the  $HOO^*$  intermediate combines with a fourth OH- to form a water molecule and an oxygen molecule with an electron lost (HOO\*+OH<sup>-</sup>→e<sup>-</sup>+  $H_2O + O_2$ ). The metal active center is preserved throughout the OER process.

#### Conclusion

In summary, we prepared a series of scalable 3d transition metal and their alloy electrocatalysts with homogeneous size by combining the sol-gel self-propagating combustion method and the subsequent H<sub>2</sub> reduction process. The as-synthesized CoFe alloy exhibited the most outstanding OER performance with an overpotential of 310 mV at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. Importantly, the catalyst also displayed superior durability of 48 h at 10 and 20 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, which may be due to the internal properties of CoFe alloy and the uniform mixing of Co and Fe elements in the synthesis process. Overall, this work used a facial and productive method to prepare transition metal alloy electrocatalysts with high activity for promising energy devices.

# **Experimental Section**

*Synthesis of gel.* The gel was synthesized by a simple sol-gel method. Briefly, metal nitrates including cobalt nitrate (Co- $(NO_3)_2 \cdot 6H_2O$ ) and iron nitrate (Fe $(NO_3)_3 \cdot 9H_2O$ ) were dissolved in

Figure 6. The proposed possible OER mechanisms.

10 mL of deionized water and the molar ratio was 1:1. Simultaneously, citric acid was dissolved in 5 ml of deionized water. The molar ratio between citric acid and metal nitrates was 1.5:1. Then, the citric acid solution was added dropwise to the metal nitrates solution under vigorous magnetic stirring. After that, the ammonium hydroxide (NH $_3 \cdot H_2 O)$  was added to the mixture until the solution was neutral. Finally, the solution was dried at 100 °C for 72 h to get the gel.

Synthesis of metal oxide powder. The metal oxide powder was synthesized via a self-propagating combustion process. Briefly, by burning the gel at  $450\,^{\circ}\text{C}$  for 1 h, loose metal oxide powder was obtained.

Synthesis of CoFe alloy. The CoFe alloy was synthesized by a simple  $\rm H_2$  reduction process. Briefly, the metal oxide powder was placed in a tube furnace, which was then calcined at 500°C for 3 h under a flowing  $5\,\%{\rm H_2/N_2}$  atmosphere. After cooling, the ultrafine CoFe alloy powder was obtained. For comparison, the metallic Fe, Co, Ni, FeNi and CoNi alloys were also prepared via the same synthetic strategy.

Characterization. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were captured in order to observe the morphology of the samples. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses were performed for structural characterization of the materials.

Electrochemical measurements. The electrochemical tests were conducted on a conventional three-electrode system. The counter electrode, reference electrode and working electrode were graphite rod, Hg/HgO electrode and carbon cloth respectively. Through adding 2 mg of catalyst powder in the mixture including 50 µL of ethanol, 10 mL of 5% Nafion solution and 190 μL of deionized water, the sample ink was obtained. The uniform ink (10 µL) was then dropped onto a bare CC (0.5 cm×0.5 cm) and dried in the air. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) tests were first conducted to obtain a stable surface. Then, the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) measurements were performed to evaluate OER performance of the catalysts under the scan rate of 2 mVs<sup>-1</sup>. The Nyquist plots of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were tested under the frequency from 0.1 to 10<sup>5</sup> Hz. The electrochemical surface area (ECSA) was obtained by the cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves at different scan rates. Finally, the electrochemical stability tests were performed at 10 and 20 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, respectively. All tested values vs Hg/HgO in 1 M KOH were turned into the potentials vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) according to the Nernst equation (E<sub>vs.</sub>  $_{RHE} = E_{vs. Hg/HgO} + 0.059pH + 0.098).$

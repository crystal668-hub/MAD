Herein, we report a novel cobalt doped transitional metal carbide based OER electrocatalyst, cobalt doped  $\beta$ -molybdenum carbide ( $\beta$ -Mo $_2$ C) encapsulated by nitrogen doped carbon framework Co $_{0.1}$ - $\beta$ -Mo $_2$ C@NC, which shows an unexpected onset overpotential of 200 mV and an overpotential of 262.2 mV at current density of 10 mA/cm². This strategy of cobalt doping reduces the amount of cobalt, increases the density of active sites as well, furthermore, the introduction of molybdenum carbide enhances the stability of the catalyst.

Compared to the enormous fossil energy exhausted during the traditional procedure of hydrogen manufacture<sup>1</sup>, the electrochemical water splitting is more promising. Although high quality electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) can optimize the overpotential to a really low value, yet it needs higher energy to overcome the sluggish kinetics, or rather the overpotential of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) the anode reaction of electrochemical water splitting. Resulting from stability and efficiency, noble metal and transitional metalbased materials draw many researchers' attention to their utilization towards OER2. Nevertheless, the high cost and contamination during synthesis of noble metal-based catalysts block the development of their further utilization<sup>3</sup>. Therefore, it is of utmost urgency to explore more economical substitutes with equivalent or even better activity as well as stability based earth-abundant elements to achieve sustainable electrochemical water splitting technology.

On account of high theoretically catalytical ability and abundant storage on the earth, electrocatalysts based on 3d transitional metals have been reckoned as the most promising OER electrocatalyst<sup>4</sup>. In particular, Co-based OER electrocatalysts of

Herein, we demonstrate a novel OER electrocatalyst of Co doped  $\beta$ -molybdenum carbide encapsulated by nitrogen doped carbon framework dubbed  $\text{Co}_n\text{-}\beta\text{-Mo}_2\text{C@NC}$ , which shows an unexpected onset overpotential of 200 mV and an overpotential of 262.2 mV at current density of 10 mA/cm². Catalysts exhibit plenty of  $\beta\text{-Mo}_2\text{C}$  nanoparticles (NPs) uniformly encapsulated in carbon framework. The OER process of the optimized sample reveals promising reaction kinetics, much lower overpotential compared to pure  $\beta\text{-Mo}_2\text{C}$  and a long-term stability for over 16 h, which can be probably ascribed to the change of d-band structure of  $\beta\text{-Mo}_2\text{C}$  caused by cobalt doping  $^{12,14,15}$ .

**Scheme 1.** Schematic diagram of Co<sub>n</sub>-β-Mo<sub>2</sub>C@NC synthesis

As depicted in the **Scheme 1**, cobalt doped  $\beta$ -molybdenum carbide encapsulated in nitrogen doped carbon framework were synthesized by simply calcination of bimetallic ZIFs of different Co/Zn mole ratio saturated with DMF solution of

different compositions, such as oxides, hydroxides and alloys<sup>2,5,6</sup> with various morphologies, such as Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/C nanowires<sup>7</sup>, CoOOH nanosheets<sup>8</sup>, Co–Ni nanoparticles<sup>9</sup> and so on<sup>2,5,10</sup>. Whereas, the price of cobalt is relatively expensive compared to other transitional metals, and the stability of cobalt-based electrocatalysts is poor. Recently, a few materials based on molybdenum carbide have been synthesized and their catalytical ability were tested as well as stability<sup>11</sup>, owing to the unique d-band electronic structure and high electrical conductivity provided by molybdenum carbide<sup>12,13</sup>. It will be a new idea that combine the advantages of cobalt based materials and molybdenum carbide to design a novel OER electrocatalyst.

MoO<sub>2</sub>(acac)<sub>2</sub> under nitrogen atmosphere at 900 °C. The asobtained samples were denoted as Co<sub>n</sub>-β-Mo<sub>2</sub>C@NC. Three different bimetallic ZIFs presented polyhedron morphology, revealing an average size of 200 nm (Figure S1). Owing to cellular structure of ZIFs, DMF solution of MoO<sub>2</sub>(acac)<sub>2</sub> could be inhaled thoroughly, which guaranteed the enrichment of molybdenum source in the precursor. Both pyrolysis of MoO<sub>2</sub>(acac)<sub>2</sub> contained in the pores of the ZIFs and the ZIFs

itself led to the formation of the Mo<sub>2</sub>C.

**Figure.1** (a) XRD pattern of Co $_{0.1}$ -β-Mo $_2$ C@NC, (b) Raman spectra of Co $_n$ -β-Mo $_2$ C@NC, (c) N $_2$  sorption isotherms for Co $_{0.1}$ -β-Mo $_2$ C@NC sample, before and after calcination, (d) Pore size distributions of Co $_{0.1}$ -β-Mo $_2$ C@NC before and after calcination based on the density functional theory (DFT) method.

The composition of these samples was studied by XRD. The XRD pattern indicates that sample  $Co_{0.1}$ - $\beta$ - $Mo_2C$  (JCPDS file no. 35-0787) and graphite (JCPDS file no. 75-2078), as shown in Figure 1a. Due to the rather low doping amount of cobalt after calcination (Table S1)<sup>16</sup>, there is no cobalt related phase detected. The average size of  $Mo_2C$  particles encapsulated in carbon framework was calculated through Scherer equation ( $D=K\lambda/Bcos\vartheta$ ) being approximately 5.14 nm, which is basically consistent with the results obtained from HRTEM showing the average size of  $\beta$ - $Mo_2C$  particles. SEM image reveals that the material still presents a morphology of uniformly atrophic polyhedron caused by calcination at high temperature (Figure S2).

As shown in Figure 1b, the presence of D-band peak at 1334 cm<sup>-1</sup> and G-band peak at 1582 cm<sup>-1</sup> in the Raman spectrum of the  $Co_n$ - $\beta$ - $Mo_2C@NC$ , is corresponded to the characteristic peaks of graphite, revealing the existence of carbon matrix. Interestingly, the relatively high intensity of D-band peak, causing by uniformly distributed nitrogen, is supposed to be the evidence of high defect concentration<sup>17</sup>, which would affect the catalytical activity positively. Moreover, the degree of graphitization of materials is increased accompanied with the decline of  $I_D/I_G$ , probably causing by the rise of cobalt contents<sup>18</sup>.

The porous structure of  $Co_{0.1}$ - $\beta$ - $Mo_2C@NC$  was characterized through nitrogen absorption/desorption (Figure 1c), which displays the large pore volume and surface area of material before calcination. The BET (Brunauer-Emmett-Teller) surface areas of the material are 1722.867 m²/g and 518.604 m²/g for

before and after calcination, respectively. The Name assembling isotherm of the sample after calcination displays a hysteresis loop, indicating there are many slits in the material operation pyrolysis. Owing to the slow heating rate, the porous texture of the material could be retained mostly, while the pore volume decreased probably because of the existence of cobalt NPs, which have been reported for its activity of catalyzing carbon to form other morphology<sup>20</sup>. As shown in Figure 1d, before calcination, the pore width distribution of the material demonstrates that the structure is composed with micropores less than 3 nm, while after calcination, cumulative pore volume declines accompanied with the formation of mesoporous, affected by cobalt NPs.

TEM image reveals the nanostructure of Co<sub>0.1</sub>-β-Mo<sub>2</sub>C@NC, consisting of cobalt doped β-Mo<sub>2</sub>C NPs embedded in carbonized polyhedron through pyrolysis of ZIFs (Figure 2a). Owing to the calcination at a slow heating rate, the structure of ZIFs get fully carbonized, retaining the morphology greatly. And low magnification TEM image demonstrated the homogeneity of the Co<sub>0.1</sub>-β-Mo<sub>2</sub>C@NC (Figure S3). However, the size of the carbon framework declines to less than 100 nm because of complete carbonization. The fine morphology of Co<sub>0.1</sub>-β-Mo<sub>2</sub>C@NC sample was further investigated by high-resolution TEM (HRTEM), as shown in Figure 2b. The lattice fringes correspond to lattice distances of 0.236 nm and 0.260 nm representing (002) and (100) facets of β-Mo<sub>2</sub>C, respectively. Analysis of Co<sub>0.1</sub>-β-Mo<sub>2</sub>C@NC through elemental mapping of scanning TEM (STEM) indicates that Mo and C distributed homogeneously on the entire material, while Co and N also reach uniform level of distribution (Figure 2g&2f). Element mapping of C is enhanced substantially due to existence of

carbon matrix.

The surface analysis of  $Co_{0.1}$ - $\beta$ - $Mo_2C@NC$ , including surface composition and valance state was further investigated by XPS. The survey spectrum reveals the existence of C, O, Mo and Co

in the composites (Figure S4). The XPS spectrum of doping Co in the final material shows the visible peaks of Co 2p<sub>1/2</sub> and Co 2p<sub>3/2</sub>, which varies the electron feature of Mo<sub>2</sub>C, adjusting the d-band electron density of Mo (Figure S5a). After deconvolution, the spectrum of Co can be divided into five types of peaks, among which the peak around 776.1 eV was assigned to Co<sup>0</sup>. The peaks located at 781.1 eV and 797.0 eV belonging to Co  $2p_{3/2}$  and Co  $2p_{1/2}$  which were the two main core-level signals of Co. The peaks observed at binding energy of 780.4 eV and 782.5 eV correspond to Co-N interaction, which will be analyzed minutely further. The satellite peaks situated at binding energy of 786.9 eV and 802.4 eV, corresponding to the oxides of Co species<sup>14,20</sup>. For Figure S5d&S5b, the high resolution XPS spectra of C 1s and N 1s reveal the successfully doping of nitrogen into carbon layer. As depicted in Figure S5d, the spectrum of C 1s can be fitted to several chemical interactions which are attributed to C=C, C=N, C-O/C-N and C=O-O at 284.5 eV, 285.0 eV, 285.95 eV and 288.4 eV, respectively. The signal of C=C indicates formation of carbon layers, the existence of C=N and C-N reveals the interaction between doping N and C atoms in carbon layers, the tiny peak of C=O-O might originate from oxidation of carbon layers<sup>21</sup>. Furthermore, the high resolution XPS spectrum of N 1s (Figure S5b) can be deconvoluted into component peaks with binding energy at 398.4 eV and 401.1 eV, corresponding to pyridinic N and graphitic N, respectively<sup>22</sup>. The electron density of carbon layer can be synergistically tuned due to lone-pair electron of these doping nitrogen<sup>23,24</sup>. The increasing of pyridinic N can also increase the density of states at the Fermi level  $(D_{FF})$ , which can promote the formation of local donor states near the  $D_{EF}$ , availing to catalytical activity<sup>25</sup>. The fitting of Mo 3d peaks and high resolution XPS spectrum of Mo (Figure S5c) suggest the existence of several oxidation states of Mo in the sample. The peaks at 227.9 eV and 231.2 eV can be attributed to  $Mo^{\delta+}$  (0  $\leq \delta+\leq 4$ ) species, indicating Mo-Mo and Mo-C bonds in β-Mo<sub>2</sub>C, while the higher oxidation states of Mo (Mo4+ at binding energy of 229.7 eV/231.9 eV, Mo<sup>6+</sup> at binding energy of 232.3 eV/234.95 eV) may arise from the contamination in virtue of exposure to the air<sup>15,21</sup>.

X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) measurements were carried out, further revealing the active sites structure. The deconvolution of these spectra was obtained through Athena (XAS data processing software) $^{26}$ . The position of obtained Co K-edge absorption peak of Co<sub>0.1</sub>- $\beta$ -Mo<sub>2</sub>C@NC is nearly similar to that of Co foil (Co<sup>0</sup>), as shown in Figure 3a. Furthermore, the EXAFS spectrum of Co<sub>0.1</sub>- $\beta$ -Mo<sub>2</sub>C@C demonstrates the

existence of Co-Co and Co-N. For Co-Co, which is now served to that in Co foil, on account of the interest of Co. While for Co-N, which shows strong coordination interaction with nitrogen doped carbon framework in  $Co_{0.1}$ - $\beta$ -Mo<sub>2</sub>C@NC (Figure 3b).

Here, we investigate the OER catalytical ability of Co<sub>n</sub>-β-Mo<sub>2</sub>C@NC with a three-electrode system in oxygen saturated 1 M KOH aqueous solution at room temperature. The sample without cobalt doping showed sluggish OER, while the typical polarization curves of the three samples with cobalt doping showed much better OER activity in Figure 4a. Co<sub>0.1</sub>-β-Mo<sub>2</sub>C@NC displayed the best OER performance among these electrocatalysts, which achieved a small OER overpotential of merely 262.2 mV at current density of 10 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> ( $\eta_{10}$ ). As a benchmark, RuO<sub>2</sub> was tested with the same condition, showing an OER overpotential ( $\eta_{10}$ ) of 280 mV, observably weaker than that of Co<sub>0.1</sub>-β-Mo<sub>2</sub>C@NC, as shown in Figure 4a. Interestingly, the three samples with cobalt doping could obtain 10 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> catalytic current at comparatively low potential, which made a great progress compared to β-Mo<sub>2</sub>C@C. The phenomenon was not surprising. Or rather, a synergistic effect occurred between β-Mo<sub>2</sub>C and proper amount of doping cobalt<sup>27</sup>, which results in the significant increasement in OER catalytical activity. The Cdl value of Co<sub>0.2</sub>-β-Mo<sub>2</sub>C@NC, Co<sub>0.1</sub>-β-Mo<sub>2</sub>C@NC and Co<sub>0.05</sub>-β-Mo<sub>2</sub>C@NC is 5.90 mF/cm<sup>2</sup>, 4.97 mF/cm<sup>2</sup> and 1.32 mF/cm<sup>2</sup>, respectively, as shown in Figure 4b, calculated from Figure S6. The electrochemical surface area (ECSA) of the Co<sub>0.2</sub>-β- $Mo_2C@NC$ ,  $Co_{0.1}$ - $\beta$ - $Mo_2C@NC$  and  $Co_{0.05}$ - $\beta$ - $Mo_2C@NC$  is 147.5, 124.25 and 33.00, respectively, obtained through dividing by 0.04 mF/cm<sup>2</sup>. When the geometric current density was further calculated by normalizing to the corresponding ECSA values, the Co<sub>0.1</sub>-β-Mo<sub>2</sub>C@NC still performed the highest OER activity (Figure. S7).

To further understand the OER catalytical kinetics of  $Co_n$ - $\beta$ - $Mo_2C@NC$ , the Tafel slope was obtained. In Figure 4c, the Tafel

slope of the Co $_{0.1}$ - $\beta$ -Mo $_2$ C@NC was calculated to be 28.8 mV dec $^{-1}$ , which was greatly lower than that of the RuO $_2$  (90.6 mV dec $^{-1}$ ), while much lower than that of Co $_{0.2}$ - $\beta$ -Mo $_2$ C@NC (78.6 mV dec $^{-1}$ ) and Co $_{0.05}$ - $\beta$ -Mo $_2$ C@NC (66.5 mV dec $^{-1}$ ), revealing the favourable OER kinetics of the Co $_{0.1}$ - $\beta$ -Mo $_2$ C@NC. The samples were further investigated by electrochemical impendence spectroscopy (EIS) under equivalent OER conditions (Figure 4d). The EIS measurements exhibited charge transfer resistance (Rct) of Co $_{0.1}$ - $\beta$ -Mo $_2$ C@NC demonstrated an obvious diminution of Rct compared to the others, further confirming the promotion in OER process.

Co $_{0.1}$ - $\beta$ -Mo $_2$ C@NC was tested in the same condition for its long-term stability which is a significant factor of promising electrocatalyst. In Figure S8, long-term stability was monitored necessarily by a chronoamperometry test at a controlled potential of 1.49 V vs. RHE, which showed a relatively stable OER current for more than 16 hours, demonstrating a good electrocatalytic durability. As a comparation, the OER performance of the sample without  $\beta$ -Mo $_2$ C was tested in the same condition, shown in Figure S9 and Figure S10. Furthermore, the XPS measurement was utilized to observe the variation of the Co $_{0.1}$ - $\beta$ -Mo $_2$ C@NC after stability test (Figure S11 and Table S3). Shown in Figure S12, the TEM image of Co $_{0.1}$ - $\beta$ -Mo $_2$ C@NC after more than 16 h stability test still retained the morphology of polyhedron with tiny damage.

The mechanism of OER on Co-doping  $\beta$ -Mo<sub>2</sub>C@NC material in alkaline solution probably involves several steps<sup>22</sup>. The main function of the OER electrocatalyst is to adsorb the reactants on the surface to form an adsorption intermediate, thereby promoting charge transfer between the electrode and the reactant<sup>28</sup>. Recently, it has been reported that cobalt doping in Mo<sub>2</sub>C could increase the electron density around  $D_{EF}^{15}$ , which contributes to the synergistic effect between cobalt and Mo<sub>2</sub>C, resulting promotion of catalytical activity. However, owing to the chemical affinity between Co<sup>2+</sup> and OH<sup>-</sup>, with increasing number of catalytical circulations, catalytical activity will probably decline, which causes fluctuation and declination in the I-t curve.

In summary, we have reported a novel OER catalyst,  $Co_{0.1}$ - $\beta$ - $Mo_2C@NC$ , affording a low overpotential of 262.2 mV at current density of 10 mA/cm², a small Tafel slope of 28.8 mV dec<sup>-1</sup> and also a good stability for more than 16 h in alkaline solution. Compared to other cobalt or molybdenum carbide-based materials, in the same condition, great promotion of catalytical activity occurred with enhancement of kinetics and conductivity, owing to the synergistic effect caused by cobalt doping, and the large surface area of the catalyst. We have proved that it could be a promising and unique research approach from materials based on transitional metal oxides/hydroxides by means of some modifications of transitional metal carbides to enhance their conductivity and enlarge their surface area to gain an effective OER catalyst.

A visible-light-driven electronic structure regulation strategy is developed to boost the OER activity of NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/NiFe-LDH electrocatalyst, whose typical Z-scheme heterostructure makes it an ideal model to explore the mechanisms of photo-generated carriers in the electrocatalytic OER. The oxidation current of the composite increases significantly under visible light irradiation, resulting in a dramatic drop of the overpotential to 180 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. The Z-scheme heterostructure with efficient charge separation promotes photogenerated electrons transfer from NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> to NiFe-LDH, leading to the formation of electron-rich Ni and Fe sites in NiFe-LDH and abundant photogenerated holes left in NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, which are responsible for the improved electrocatalytic performance. This study highlights the important role of photo-activated electron structure regulation in electrocatalysis.

#### 1. Introduction

Electrocatalytic water splitting provides an efficient and sustainable approach for green hydrogen generation; <sup>[1-3]</sup> in particular, the anode oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with the multi-electron and multi-proton coupling steps features sluggish kinetics and large overpotentials of 300-500 mV and thus is generally regarded as the bottleneck for water splitting. <sup>[4, 5]</sup> In this regard, efficient electrocatalysts that can accelerate O-H bond breaking and O-O bond formation are highly required. <sup>[6]</sup>

In the past decades, NiFe layered double hydroxides (NiFe-LDH) were acknowledged as the most promising alternatives to the benchmark RuO<sub>2</sub>/IrO<sub>2</sub> catalyst in alkaline condition.<sup>[7, 8]</sup> Enormous efforts have been devoted to activating the NiFe-LDH by electronic structure regulation of surface metals.<sup>[9, 10]</sup> However, the positive results and methods are still limited and more importantly, the present catalysts still suffer from inferior OER activity and stability. As a result, a more simple and efficient strategy on electronic structure regulation is urgently required for further

boosting the electrocatalytic OER performance of NiFe-LDH, and the corresponding regulation mechanism and effect are imperative to be recognized.

Lately, the plasmonic "hot electronics" emerged as an effective electron traps to modulate the electron density of active sites and optimize the electrochemical water splitting performance. [11] For example, the pioneering work revealed that Au/Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> nanosheets exhibited an superior OER performance under 532 nm laser as a result of the Au-surface plasmon resonance (SPR) activated Ni<sup>III/IV</sup> sites. [12] This work proved the potential of combining solar light and electricity for synergistically improving the electrocatalytic properties. Unfortunately, so far, most such works reported are limited to noble metals such as Au, Pt, Pd and their widespread uses are seriously restricted by the exorbitant prices and the low photochemical efficiencies. [13] As abundant and efficient solar harvests, transition metal oxides are widely utilized as photocatalysts, whose light adsorption is closely associated with the nature band gap. [14, 15] Inspired by the above, we suggest that by integrating photochemical and electrochemical energy conversion system, the photogenerated carriers in transition metal oxides may be a convenient and effective way to tailor the electronic state of metal cations in NiFe-LDH and finally enhance the OER performance of the catalyst while to our knowledge, it has not been reported.

The key to optimize the photo-induced electrochemical OER activity is the rational design of stable NiFe-LDH/transition metal oxides heterostructures that match well with the band edge positions for accelerating the separation of photogenerated charge carriers and preventing the electron-hole recombination under visible light irradiation, and meanwhile facilitate more active metal species formation during the OER process.<sup>[16]</sup> Nickel ferrite (NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>), an n-type semiconductor, has recently attracted tremendous attention in photocatalysis, owing to stable chemical and physical structure, wide adsorption in the visible region, high adsorption capacity and the necessary band gap for water splitting.<sup>[17]</sup> Also, it presents a highly conductive structure due to the electron hopping between different valence metals in O-sites, which compensates for the low

conductivity of NiFe-LDH.<sup>[18]</sup> Above all, with visible light irradiation, the charge separation at the NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/NiFe-LDH heterogeneous interface can be accelerated under visible light irradiation, which may activate the metal active species and benefit the OER kinetics. Thus, it is an encouraging project to engineer a novel NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/NiFe-LDH heterostructure and explore the photoactivated electronic structure regulation mechanisms for improving the electrocatalytic OER activity under visible light conditions.

As a proof of concept, herein, we design a photo-responsive electrocatalyst based on NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> decorated NiFe-LDH nanosheets and demonstrate that the surface electronic structure of NiFe-LDH can be modified to boost the OER performance of the catalyst under visible-light irradiation. The Z-scheme NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/NiFe-LDH heterostructure makes it an ideal model to explore the mechanisms of photo-generated carriers in the electrocatalytic OER. It has been discovered that the Z-scheme heterostructure promotes photogenerated electrons transfer from NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> to NiFe-LDH upon visible light irradiation on catalysts, resulting in the increase of electron density of Ni and Fe in NiFe-LDH, as evidenced by the *in-situ* irradiated X-ray photoelectron spectrum (XPS), UV-vis diffused reflectance spectroscopy (UV-DRS) and Mott-Schottky (M-S) analyses. The electron-rich Ni and Fe sites could promote their early oxidation to higher valence states and facilitate the deprotonating step. Besides, the abundant photogenerated holes in the NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> could also benefit the formation of highly active oxidative metal ions and the fast absorption of OH to the active sites. These factors together accelerated the OER kinetics and lowered the overpotential of catalyst to 180 mV at current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. The visible-light-driven electron structure regulation strategy thus provides a new and efficient avenue for optimizing the electrocatalytic activities.

#### 2. Results and Discussion

The NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/NiFe-LDH nanosheet arrays were prepared through a simple one-step hydrothermal reaction, as illustrated in **Figure S1** (See Supporting Information). The scanning

electron microscopy (SEM) images reveal that two-dimensional dense nanosheets grow vertically on the surface of Ni foam (NF) with a rough surface and a thickness of ~ 50 nm (**Figure 1a** and **b**). The detailed structure of the rough NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/NiFe-LDH nanosheets was further investigated with transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The surfaces of the nanosheets are decorated with many nanoparticles, as shown in Figure 1c. The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image of these nanoparticle exhibits the lattice spacing of 0.29 nm and 0.25 nm, corresponding to the (220) and (311) lattice planes of NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, respectively, and a lattice fringe of 0.20 nm is found, which can be assigned to the (018) facet of NiFe-LDH (Figure 1d). Besides, obvious interfaces of NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> and NiFe-LDH are shown in the HRTEM image (red lines). The corresponding selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern with bright circles in the inset of Figure 1d can also be attributed to the different diffraction planes of NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> and NiFe-LDH, further demonstrating the tight integration of NiFe-LDH and NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>. The elemental mapping images of NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/NiFe-LDH reveal that Ni, Fe and O elements are homogeneously distributed on the nanosheets and no other element is found (Figure 1e-h and Figure S2, Supporting Information). These results all proved that the NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/NiFe-LDH heterostructure was well formed. For comparisons, the pure single component of NiFe-LDH and NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> were fabricated (**Figure S3** and **S4**, Supporting Information).

The phase composition and purity of NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/NiFe-LDH heterostructure were analyzed by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectroscopy. The diffraction peaks located at 44.5°, 51.8°, and 76.4° correspond to the Ni, while the other peaks are assigned to NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (JCPDS No. 86-2267) and NiFe-LDH (JCPDS No. 40-0215) (**Figure 2a**). The Raman spectrum in **Figure 2b** shows the peaks centered at 196, 330 and 701 cm<sup>-1</sup> which are indexed to the T<sub>2g</sub>, E<sub>g</sub> and A<sub>1g</sub> modes of NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>.<sup>[19]</sup> The peaks at 456 and 534 cm<sup>-1</sup> are assigned to the Ni-O stretching of NiFe-LDH, and the 295 cm<sup>-1</sup> signal is attributed to the E-type vibration of the Ni-OH lattice, <sup>[20]</sup> which echo well with the spectrum obtained by pure NiFe-LDH. These results fully demonstrated that the asobtained structure is a composite of NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> and NiFe-LDH without any impurities.

XPS measurements were further performed to confirm the chemical compositions and valences of the NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/NiFe-LDH catalyst. The survey spectrum demonstrates the presence of Ni, Fe and O elements in the as-prepared samples (**Figure S5**. Supporting Information). The Ni 2p XPS spectra can be fitted into two spin-orbit doublets and two shake-up satellites (Figure 2c). The peaks at 855.3 and 873.1 eV correspond to Ni<sup>2+</sup>, while the peaks at 856.5 and 874.6 eV are attributed to Ni<sup>3+</sup>. [21] For the XPS spectrum of Fe 2p, the peaks at 712.3 and 724.7 eV are assigned to Fe<sup>3+</sup> species (**Figure 2d**). [22, 23] In addition, the Ni 2p XPS and Fe 2p XPS spectra in NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/NiFe-LDH both exhibit positive shifts relative to those for NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, but negative shifts concerning the peaks of NiFe-LDH, confirming that electrons transferred from NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> to NiFe-LDH in NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/NiFe-LDH. [24] To evaluate the feasibility of NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/NiFe-LDH heterostructure in the photo-enhanced electrocatalytic system, the optical absorption capability of the electrode was first investigated by UV-DRS. As shown in Figure S6 (Supporting Information), NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/NiFe-LDH exhibits a strong adsorption at the visible region which is much higher than that of NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> and NiFe-LDH samples, indicating the excellent light-harvesting property of NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/NiFe-LDH. Thus, NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/NiFe-LDH might be a promising catalyst to explore the photo-enhanced electrochemical properties and the electrocatalytic OER performance was then performed in 1.0 M KOH solution by measuring polarization curves in a three-electrode system with or without simulated visible light irradiation. As comparisons, the pure NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> and NiFe-LDH samples were also tested under the same conditions. In the dark, the NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/NiFe-LDH heterostructure shows an overpotential of 206 mV at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, much lower than those of NiFe-LDH (231 mV) and NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (334 mV) catalysts (Figure 3a). The superior OER performance of NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/NiFe-LDH to NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> and NiFe-LDH catalysts could be ascribed to the largest electrochemical active surface area of NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/NiFe-LDH (Figure S7, Supporting Information), and the electronic interaction at the NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/NiFe-LDH interface which increased the electron density in NiFe-LDH and produced the highly oxidative Ni and Fe in NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, and thus boosted the OER kinetics and improved the OER activity. [25] After

exposed to visible light at room temperature, an improvement of the OER activity was observed for all catalysts. Specifically, NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/NiFe-LDH (light) delivers only 180 and 231 mV to achieve the current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, which is superior to most those reported for the NiFe-LDH based OER catalysts (Table S1). Remarkably, compared to that of NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/NiFe-LDH, the overpotential of NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/NiFe-LDH (light) at 100 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> decreases dramatically by 47 mV (**Figure 3b**). In contrast, NiFe-LDH (light) and NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (light) require overpotentials of 294 mV and 430 mV to reach 100 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> which are 22 mV and 13 mV lower than those in the dark, respectively. These phenomena implied that the photo-promoted OER performance of NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/NiFe-LDH heterostructure was not just a simple summation of the two results of NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> and NiFe-LDH, but could be a synergistic effect of the two components.

In order to have a preliminary of this phenomenon, Tafel plots of the three samples were analyzed based on their OER polarization curves. Similarly, NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/NiFe-LDH heterostructure exhibits a Tafel value of 49.3 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>, smaller than 64.2 mV dec<sup>-1</sup> of NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/NiFe-LDH and 71.4 mV dec<sup>-1</sup> of NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (**Figure 3c**), indicating a faster OER kinetics for NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/NiFe-LDH. Under visible light irradiation, the Tafel slope of NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/NiFe-LDH (light) decreases significantly to 40.6 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>, demonstrating that visible light irradiation accelerates the OER kinetics and therefore, improves the OER activity of NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/NiFe-LDH catalyst. As shown in **Figure S8** (Supporting Information), higher turnover frequencies (TOFs) of 0.071 s<sup>-1</sup> and 0.175 s<sup>-1</sup> are achieved for NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/NiFe-LDH at the overpotentials of 400 and 500 mV under visible-light irradiation, being 1.1 and 1.29 times those of NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/NiFe-LDH without light, respectively, further confirming that visible-light can improve the intrinsic activity of NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/NiFe-LDH electrocatalyst. Besides, the chronopotentiometric response of NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/NiFe-LDH catalyst with light irradiation on and off reveals that visible light irradiation causes an obvious decrease of the potential, further manifesting the improvement of the OER activity (**Figure 3d**). The Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurement was also employed to give a better understanding of the charge-transfer kinetics

of catalysts. The results show that NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/NiFe-LDH (light) has the smallest charge-transfer resistance ( $R_{ct}$ ) of 1.38  $\Omega$ , suggesting the enhanced charge transport efficiency (**Figure S9a** and **Table S2**, Supporting Information). Remarkably, the NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/NiFe-LDH (light) displays a negligible increase of potential during the chronopotentiometric stability test for more than 30 h (**Figure S9b**, Supporting Information) and the polarization curve after the stability test also shows the slight decrease compared to the initial test (**Figure S10**, Supporting Information). Furthermore, the morphology and structure have little change (**Figure S11** and **S12**, Supporting Information), indicating the promise of adopting the long-term stable NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/NiFe-LDH as a high-performance photo-promoted OER catalyst.

Further to have an in-depth insight into the enhancement effect of light on water oxidation performance of NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/NiFe-LDH catalyst, M-S analysis was first performed on NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> and NiFe-LDH. As presented in **Figure 4a** and **b**, NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> and NiFe-LDH both exhibit the positive slope in the M-S plots, indicating the n-type semiconductor properties. The Kubelka-Munk plots of NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> and NiFe-LDH were obtained using the UV-DRS (**Figure S13**, Supporting Information). The bandgaps are 1.51 eV and 1.72 eV for the NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> and NiFe-LDH, respectively. Besides, the NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/NiFe-LDH catalyst displays a more significant increase in the photocurrent responses (about 0.28 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>) at 1.2 V under pulsed light irradiation (**Figure S14**, Supporting Information), much larger than those of NiFe-LDH (0.06 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>), and NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (0.04 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>), manifesting that the photo-induced electron-hole pairs in NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/NiFe-LDH catalyst are more easy to separate and transfer, and thus could enhance electronic regulation at the NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/NiFe-LDH interface.

For a direct illustration of the photoexcited electron transfer direction between NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> and NiFe-LDH, in-situ irradiated XPS was conducted under irradiation. As shown in **Figure 4c** and **d**, the electron binding energy of Ni 2p and Fe 2p in NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/NiFe-LDH (light) both increases compared with the pristine NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/NiFe-LDH catalyst, which indicates that the charge carrier migration pathway from NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> to NiFe-LDH is enhanced under light irradiation condition.  $^{[26, 27]}$ 

The photogenerated electrons transfer leads to a further increase in electronic densities of Ni and Fe in NiFe-LDH and more abundant photogenerated holes left to oxidize NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>. By contrast, no obvious change can be observed in the binding energies for the NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> and NiFe-LDH with/without light irradiation, respectively (Figure S15, Supporting Information). Based on the aforementioned results, the Z-scheme photo-generated electrons transfer mechanism of NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/NiFe-LDH for enhancing the electrocatalytic OER process is proposed (**Figure 4e**). The band gap level analysis reveals that conduction band (CB) and valance band (VB) positions are approximately 0.15 and 1.66 V for NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, respectively and -0.38 eV, 1.34 eV for NiFe-LDH, respectively. Similarly, the bandgap value and VB potential of NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/NiFe-LDH is about 1.57 eV and 0.03 V, respectively (Figure S16, Supporting Information). Under visible light irradiation, photo-induced electron-hole pairs are generated in NiFe-LDH and NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>. The photo-generated electrons are transferred from NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> to NiFe-LDH, resulting in an efficient space separation of photo-induced charge carriers. [28, 29] The accelerated electron transfer endows NiFe-LDH with electron-rich Ni and Fe promote their early oxidation to higher valence states and facilitate the deprotonating step. [30] Meanwhile, due to the relative low VB position of NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> is more negative than the potential of water oxidation, the abundant photogenerated holes stored in NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> cannot oxidize water to oxygen, but are beneficial for the formation of highly oxidative metal ions and may accelerate the fast absorption of OH to the active sites. [31, 32] These factors combined promoted the OER kinetics and enhance the OER performance of NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/NiFe-LDH.

#### 3. Conclusion

In summary, an effective strategy was proposed to regulate the surface electronic structure of NiFe-LDH for enhanced OER performance by visible-light irradiation. A photo-responsive electrocatalyst of Z-scheme NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/NiFe-LDH heterostructure is designed and prepared. The insitu irradiated XPS, UV-DRS and electrochemical results all confirm that great improvement in

OER activity relies on the photo-enhanced efficient electron transfer from  $NiFe_2O_4$  to NiFe-LDH as a result of the Z-scheme heterostructure. This work provides an insight into the visible-light-driven electron structure regulation for high-performance OER, which may open a new way for the design and synthesis of efficient photo-responsive Z-scheme electrocatalysts towards much broader energy-related applications.

#### 4. Experimental Methods

Synthesis of NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/NiFe-LDH: All reagents used in this work are analytical grade without further purification, purchased from Shanghai Chemical Reagent Factory. Typically, Fe(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>·9H<sub>2</sub>O (0.5 mmol, 202 mg) and urea (10 mmol, 600 mg) were dissolved with 35 mL of distilled water (35 mL). The obtained solution was then moved to a 45 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave. Before immersed into the above autoclave, the NF (2 \* 3 cm) was cleaned with 3 M HCl and distilled water for 20 min. Then the autoclave was heated at 120 °C for 10 h before the system was cooled down. The product was washed with deionized water and ethanol for several times and then vacuum dried overnight. The mass loading of NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/NiFe-LDH was about 0.8 mg cm<sup>-2</sup>.

Synthesis of NiFe-LDH: The NiFe-LDH was synthesized by the same method as NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/NiFe-LDH, but Ni(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>·6H<sub>2</sub>O (1.5 mmol, 437 mg) was added.

Synthesis of NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>: NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/NiFe-LDH grown on NF was heated at 450 °C for 2 h under an air atmosphere with a heating rate of 2 °C min<sup>-1</sup> to obtain NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>.

*Material characterizations*: The crystal structures of the products were characterized by XRD measurements with a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer using a Cu Ka radiation source with a velocity of 12 min<sup>-1</sup>. SEM measurements were collected on a Hitachi S-4800 scanning electron microanalyzer with an accelerating voltage of 15 kV, combined with an energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mapping to investigate the elemental distribution of the samples. TEM and HRTEM images were performed on a JEM-2100F field emission TEM at a voltage of 200 kV. The

surface element properties of the samples were investigated by XPS using an ESCALab MKII X-ray photoelectron spectrometer with Mg K $\alpha$  X-ray as the excitation source. Raman spectra were obtained from a micro Raman spectrometer (Renishaw RM 1000) at excitation laser wavelength of 532 nm. UV-DRS tests were recorded over the range of 200-800 nm in the absorption mode of a Thermo Nicolet Evolution 500 UV-vis spectrophotometer equipped with an integrating sphere attachment.

Electrochemical measurements: The electrochemical experiments were carried out in 1.0 M KOH solution (pH = 13.6) at room temperature using a bipotentiostat workstation (WD20-BASIC Metrohm PGSTAT101) with a three-electrode electrochemical cell system. In the three-electrode system, the catalyst electrodes were directly employed as the working electrodes, saturated calomel electrode (SCE, saturated KCl) as the reference electrode and a graphite rod as the counter electrode. The polarization profiles were obtained through linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) with a scan rate of 2 mV s<sup>-1</sup>. EIS measurements were recorded at a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> on a Zennium electrochemical workstation (ZAHNER, Germany) with a frequency range from 10<sup>5</sup> Hz to 0.1 Hz. The electrochemical double layer capacitance (C<sub>dl</sub>) of working electrodes were made by using cyclic voltammetry (CV) scanning with scanning rates of 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100 mV s<sup>-1</sup>. All potentials of the polarization curves were adjusted to compensate for the ohmic potential drop losses that arose from the solution resistance and calibrated with respect to reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE).

**Developing highly active, durable, and cost-effective electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is of prime importance in proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolysis techniques. Herein, a surface lanthanum-deficient (SLD) iridium oxide as a highly efficient OER electrocatalyst is reported (labeled as La3IrO7-SLD), which is obtained by electrochemical activation, and shows better activity and durability than that of commerically available IrO2 as well as most of the reported Ir-based OER electrocatalysts. At a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> , the overpotential of La3IrO7-SLD is 296 mV, which is lower than that of IrO2 (316 mV). Impressively, the increase of potential is less than 50 mV at a voltage–time chronopotentiometry extending for 60 000 s using a glass carbon electrode that is vastly superior to IrO2. Moreover, the mass activity of the catalyst is approximately five times higher than that of IrO2 at 1.60 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode. Density functional theory calculations suggest that a lattice oxygen participating mechanism with central Ir atoms serving as active sites (LOM-Ir) rationalizes the high activity and durability for the La3IrO7-SLD electrocatalyst. The favorable energy level of surface active Ir 5d orbitals relative to coordinated O 2p orbitals makes the La3IrO7-SLD more active.**

such as proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers and CO2 reduction.[1] However, the intrinsic sluggish kinetics of OER makes it a bottleneck for these renewable energy systems due to the complex multistep protoncoupled electron transfer process.[2,3] In order to achieve large OER current density at low overpotential, a stable and cost-effective electrocatalyst is highly desired to accelerate reaction rate. At present, the noble metal iridium and its oxides,[4] are still considered as the stateof-the-art OER electrocatalysts in acidic media with favorable activity, but the insufficient durability, scarcity, and high cost significantly hinder their large-scale commercialization application.[5,6] Therefore, developing alternative acidic OER electrocatalysts with high activity, robust durability as well as low noble metal loading is fundamentally important for implementing the new energy techniques.

Recently, non-noble metal and Ir mixed oxides with special crystal structures, such as Ir–Ni oxides,[7] Y2Ir2O7 pyrochlore,[8]

SrIrO3 perovskite,[9] and Ba2PrIrO6 double perovskite,[10] have been identified as promising candidates for OER catalysts in acidic electrolytes attributing to improved specific activity, apparently decent stability and low Ir amounts than benchmark IrO2. Different kind of structures and metal coordination environments for these complex oxides could produce unique electronic, geometrical, and conductive properties, thereby affecting their catalytic performance. In addition, higher activity can also be achieved by weakening the oxygen adsorption energy via crystal lattice strain.[11] Because rare-earth elements and alkali metals are thermodynamically unstable in acidic conditions,[5] dynamic surface reconstruction easily emerges on mixed oxides surface including rare-earth elements and alkali metals, which is considered as a key role for the improved OER activity.[12] However, this process compromises the stability,[13] caused by the dissolution of the iridium.[5,14] Li's group unveils that the formed nonstoichiometric Ir–O species during the OER process gradually transform to IrO2 with improved stability but decreased activity via an atom probe tomography.[4] Recently, a lattice oxygen participation mechanism points out that the activated oxygen atom is active site involving the formation of oxygen that improves the activity of the OER.[5,15,16] Therefore, producing a nonstoichiometrically stable Ir–O species surface

to achieve high activity and stability simultaneously is full of significance but challenging.

Herein, we report a La3IrO7-SLD synthesized by solid-state reaction and subsequently electrochemical activation as a highly efficient electrocatalyst for the OER in acid medium. In 0.1 m HClO4, the La3IrO7-SLD exhibits a competitive OER activity to that of commercial IrO2 and previously reported catalysts, with an overpotential of 296 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> and a small Tafel slope of 52 mV dec<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> . The formed stable Ir–O species surface makes the La3IrO7-SLD catalyst more stable than that of IrO2. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the surface Ir 5d orbitals of La3IrO7-SLD are at a lower energy level than the O 2p orbitals, and that lattice oxygen on the La3IrO7(001)-SLD surface is more active than that on La3IrO7(001) surface, which contributes to the better OER activity.

#### **2. Results and Discussion**

#### **2.1. Structural Characterization**

A simple solid-state reaction was applied to prepare the precatalyst La3IrO7 . Figure S1 (Supporting Information) shows that the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern could match well the calculated XRD pattern from inorganic crystal structure databases for La3IrO7 (ICSD: 181 573). As shown in **Figure 1**a, it is an orthorhombic phase La3IrO7 with a Cmcm space group. Figure 1b shows a panoramic image of pre-catalyst La3IrO7 obtained from scanning electron microscopy (SEM), displaying irregular polyhedral particles with a size distribution from a few hundred nanometers to less than three micrometers. The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image and corresponding selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of the prepared sample display a highly ordered fluorite structure with Cmcm space group (Figure 1c). The clear lattice fringes calculated as 0.334 and 0.374 nm correspond to the spacing of the (310) and (020) planes, respectively, of orthorhombic La3IrO7, with a dihedral angle of approximately 64° (Figure 1d). Based on Figure 1c,d, (001) facet of La3IrO7 was determined to be the exposed surface. The high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) image and the corresponding elemental mappings further confirm the polyhedral morphology and elemental composition of the La3IrO7 particles, as well as the even distribution of each element throughout the precatalyst (Figure 1e–h). As determined by inductively coupled plasma atom emission spectrometry (ICP-AES), the quantity of Ir present in the precatalyst

 $La_3IrO_7$  (29 wt%) is close to the theoretical quantity (27 wt%), and much lower than that of commercial  $IrO_2$  (85.7 wt%), which is extremely beneficial for reducing catalyst cost.

To gain insight into the surface composition, structure as well as element chemical state of the catalyst under acidic OER process, the measurements including ex situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray absorption near edge structure spectroscopy (XANES), and extended X-ray absorption finestructure spectroscopy (EXAFS) were performed. In the deconvoluted Ir 4f spectrum of the precatalyst La<sub>3</sub>IrO<sub>7</sub> (Figure 2a), the peaks with BEs of 62.4 and 65.4 eV are assigned to Ir 4f<sub>7/2</sub> and Ir 4f<sub>5/2</sub>, while the adjacent peaks with BEs of 63.5 and 66.6 eV correspond to their shake-up satellites.[17] After OER testing, the spectral shape of La<sub>3</sub>IrO<sub>7</sub>-SLD was not changed and two doublets could be fitted. The first doublet appeared at BEs of 62.2 and 63.3 eV belong to the Ir 4f<sub>7/2</sub> and its corresponding satellite peak, while another doublet at 65.2 and 66.1 eV ascribe to Ir 4f<sub>5/2</sub> and its satellite.<sup>[18]</sup> Such obvious negative shift of the Ir 4f peaks in La<sub>3</sub>IrO<sub>7</sub>-SLD compared with those of La<sub>3</sub>IrO<sub>7</sub> suggests the increase of the electron density at Ir site after experiencing OER process. This behavior, in view of previous report, maybe attributed to a fact that the lose oxygen on the surface leads to the reduction of metallic iridium valence state. [11] Deconvolution of the O 1s spectrum (Figure 2b) affords signals of Ir-O and Ir-OH in La<sub>3</sub>IrO<sub>7</sub>, which appear at BEs of 530.4 and 531.3 eV, respectively.[10,19] A weak peak positioned at 532.2 eV is related to oxygen-containing adventitious carbon species, and the peak at 528.8 eV is assigned to the lattice oxygen bound to the La

ion in La<sub>3</sub>IrO<sub>7</sub>, which disappears after extensive leaching. After the OER test, the O 1s XPS spectrum of La<sub>3</sub>IrO<sub>7</sub>-SLD displays two small peaks assigned to oxygen from adventitious H<sub>2</sub>O and carbon species at high BEs (>533 eV), as well as a broad main peak with a BE of 531.6 eV assigned to IrOH. Such higher OH content (71.7%) than that of La<sub>3</sub>IrO<sub>7</sub> (34.9%), indicates more Ir catalytic active sites in La<sub>3</sub>IrO<sub>7</sub>-SLD. The intensity of the La 3d and 4d spectra are decreased considerably after the OER test (Figure S2, Supporting Information), implying the La leaching during the electrochemical process.

The iridium L<sub>III</sub>-edge XANES of La<sub>3</sub>IrO<sub>7</sub>, La<sub>3</sub>IrO<sub>7</sub>-SLD and references Ir foil, IrCl<sub>3</sub>, and IrO<sub>2</sub> in Figure 2c features of broad white lines, which are related to transition from occupied 2p to empty 5d states.<sup>[20]</sup> The white line peak position of La<sub>3</sub>IrO<sub>7</sub> is at 11 220.9 eV, which is obviously shifted to higher energy compared with that of commercial IrO2, indicating a higher oxidation state of Ir in La<sub>3</sub>IrO<sub>7</sub> than that of IrO<sub>2</sub>. After OER testing, the main adsorption of La<sub>3</sub>IrO<sub>7</sub>-SLD exhibits a slightly negative shift to lower photon energy, suggesting the slight decrease of Ir valence state. [11] This trend in the change of Ir oxidation state is consistent with the XPS results. The corresponding  $k^3$ -weighted Fourier transforms of Ir L<sub>III</sub>-edge EXAFS spectra of the above five catalysts were collected in Figure 2d. A main peak appeared at 1.62 Å for IrO2 corresponds to the Ir-O bond, [21] which is contracted to 1.58 Å in La<sub>3</sub>IrO<sub>7</sub>. As reported by Choy et al., [22] there is a decrease in Ir-O bond distances between Iriv+, Irv+, and Irvi+ ions in perovskites, corresponding to 0.039 Å per electron oxidation state change, suggesting a formal oxidation state

of +5 for Ir in La3IrO7 . [23] After OER testing, the peak related to Ir–O interaction slightly shifts back to 1.61 Å, demonstrating the slight reduction of Ir valence state in La3IrO7-SLD compared with that of pristine La3IrO7 . The normalized La LIII-edge XANES and EXAFS spectra of La3IrO7 and La3IrO7-SLD are shown in Figure S3 in the Supporting Information.

#### **2.2. Activity and Stability Evaluation**

The OER performance of the prepared catalyst was evaluated in a typical three-electrode setup with 0.1 m HClO4 as the electrolyte. The catalytic activity of commercial IrO2 was also investigated as reference. As shown in **Figure 3**a, after electroactivation by cyclic voltammetry at 100 mV s<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> for 100 scan cycles, the resultant La3IrO7-SLD exhibits a small onset potential (defined as the potential corresponding to 1 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2) of 1.45 V (vs RHE), beyond which the anodic current rises sharply in a smaller potential range. The overpotential at current density of 10 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2 gives a benchmark to assess the electrochemical OER activity. A lower value of 296 mV observed for La3IrO7-SLD at the given current density indicates a higher catalytic activity, compared with that (316 mV) of IrO2. Especially, the Tafel slope of La3IrO7-SLD is 52 mV dec<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> , which is obviously lower than that of IrO2 (108 mV dec<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> ), indicating that La3IrO7-SLD has a faster reaction kinetics (Figure 3b). The time-dependent concentrations of Ir and La in the electrolyte are shown in Figure 3c. Before OER testing, the initial molar ratio of La to Ir in the electrolyte is ≈3:1, which is consistent with the structure of precatalyst. As the OER process proceeds, the molar ratio of La to Ir increases to 5:1 after 4 h, demonstrating the intense dissolution of La ions into the electrolyte and relative stability of Ir ions. Thus, the catalyst forms the structure with SLD, which is favorable for exposing more active sites. The surface deficientlanthanum structure is also confirmed by the STEM–EDX elemental mappings of La3IrO7 and La3IrO7-SLD, as shown in Figure S4 in the Supporting Information. Evidently, the elements of La, Ir, and O are uniformly distributed on the surface of La3IrO7 (Figure S4a–c, Supporting Information). In

contrast, the surface composition of the La3IrO7-SLD is poor in La and rich in Ir (Figure S4d–f, Supporting Information). The stability of La3IrO7-SLD and commercial IrO2 was evaluated by chronopotentiometry technique at a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2, as illustrated in Figure 3d. The potential of La3IrO7-SLD is still below 1.6 V after 16 h of continuous constant-current testing, while the potential of IrO2 is beyond 1.8 V after the testing within 5 h, indicating that La3IrO7-SLD is more stable than IrO2. As previously reported, the catalyst usually experiences a transformation from nonstoichiometric IrO*x* (*x* < 2) to IrO2 with increased stability and decreased activity. For example, Li and coworkers used advanced atom probe tomography to confirm the formation of nonstoichiometric Ir–O species on an Ir film after anodic electrochemical oxidation.[4] Under a small current density (1 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2), IrO*<sup>x</sup>* transforms to IrO2 with continuous oxygen evolution after 4 h, and then completely transforms after 69 h. In our case, the surface of La3IrO7 transforms into amorphous structure with SLD after initial electrochemical testing, but only very few crystal lattices corresponding to IrO2 reappear on the surface of the catalyst after continuous testing conducted for 4 h, even at a high current density of 10 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2 (Figure S5, Supporting Information). This indicates the active SLD structure could be stabilized by bulk La3IrO7, which contributes to its high catalytic activity over an extended period of time. The overpotential of La3IrO7-SLD at 10 mA cm−2 was then compared with those of recently reported electrocatalysts in acidic media (Figure 3e; Table S1, Supporting Information), further confirming that the performance of La3IrO7-SLD is competitive to other previously reported catalysts. Excitingly, when normalized to the mass of Ir, the mass activity (A gIr −1 ) of La3IrO7- SLD is approximatively five times higher than that of IrO2 at 1.60 V (**Figure 4**a). We also explored the optimal preparation temperature of La3IrO7-SLD catalysts by varying the annealing temperature from 1000 to 1400 °C. Evidently, the La3IrO7-SLD prepared at 1200 °C exhibits the highest activity (Figure 4b), the fastest reaction kinetics (Figure S6, Supporting Information), the smallest charge transfer resistance (*R*ct) (80 Ω) (Figure 4c), and the largest electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) that determined by *C*dl (Figure 4d; Figure S7, Supporting Information).

#### **2.3. Mechanistic Insight**

To further understand the possible active sites and reaction mechanism, DFT calculations were performed based SLD structure. According to the computed surface energy of the certain surface, the (110) and (001) surfaces are the relatively stable surfaces for La3IrO7, which have low surface energies with a difference only 0.002 eV Å<sup>−</sup>2 (Figure S8, Supporting Information). Meanwhile, the (001) is the exposed surface determined by the experimental results. Thus, a model containing (001) plane of La3IrO7 as well as SLD was constructed as research object. Two different OER mechanisms were considered: the conventional adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM) on metalion center[24] and the recently proposed lattice oxygen participation mechanism (LOM).[25] The former involves four consecutive proton

and electron transfer steps with several intermediates, i.e., HO\*, O\*, and HOO\*.[26] The corresponding intermediates structures for IrO2(110), La3IrO7(001), and La3IrO7(001)-SLD are displayed at the down planes of Figures S9–S11 (Supporting Information), respectively. Whereas for the latter, the lattice oxygen atoms involve in the catalytic reaction, and ultimately being part of the gas product. The corresponding intermediates structural models including HO\*, VO + OO\*, VO + OH\*, and HO-site\* + OH\* for IrO2(110), La3IrO7(001), and La3IrO7(001)- SLD are displayed at the up planes of Figures S9–S11 (Supporting Information), respectively. To participate in the catalytic cycle, the lattice oxygen should be active enough to escape from lattice to interact with HO\* and leave an oxygen vacancy (Vo).[27] **Figure 5**a,c,e shows the free energy diagrams of commercial IrO2(110), La3IrO7(001), and Pr3IrO7(001)-SLD on Ir sites via the above two OER mechanisms. Evidently, the free energy barrier via AEM is 2.73 eV for La3IrO7(001)-SLD to form the \*OOH that considered as the rate-determining step, which is significantly higher than those of IrO2(110) (1.81 eV) and La3IrO7(001) (2.30 eV), demonstrating the poor activity of La3IrO7(001)-SLD than that of IrO2 for OER in acidic media. However, this conclusion is in contradiction with the electrochemical testing results, thus the La3IrO7(001)-SLD may not follow the AEM mechanism. Further assuming that the resultant catalyst with defect structure follows the LOM mechanism with Ir serving as the active sites (LOM-Ir), the computed results show the OER barrier of La3IrO7(001)-SLD is 1.67 eV. In this case, the calculated minimum theoretical overpotential (*η*OER) of La3IrO7(001)-SLD is 0.44 eV, which is lower than that of IrO2 (0.58 eV) via AEM, suggesting the relatively higher OER activity of La3IrO7(001)-SLD relative to IrO2 consistent with the experimental conclusion. Making up the surface electronic features of catalyst is conducive to better understand the LOM-Ir mechanism for La3IrO7(001)-SLD. Figure 5b,d,f shows the computed projected density of states (PDOS) of Ir 5d orbitals of active Ir and O 2p orbitals of lattice oxygen that participated

in OER for IrO2, La3IrO7, and La3IrO7(001)-SLD, respectively. For IrO2(110), the electron flows from Ir to nearby O due to the Ir 5d orbital of active Ir lies above the O 2p orbital of coordinated O (Figure 5b), which constrains the oxygen inside the lattice and hinders the lattice oxygen segregation, resulting in a high reaction barrier of 4.51 eV (Figure 5a). In contrast, the surface active Ir 5d orbitals of La3IrO7(001)-SLD shows a lower energy level than that of O 2p orbitals (Figure 5f), thus the charges on O atoms will be reduced, which would endow the higher degrees of freedom for oxygen and make it easily released from the lattice. Although the position of active Ir 5d orbitals is also lower than that of coordinated O 2p orbitals for pristine La3IrO7, the reduced energy gap between Ir 5d orbitals and O 2p orbitals (Figure 5d) makes a larger energy barrier of 2.51 eV (Figure 5c) for the formation of surface Vo as the ratelimiting step. Therefore, the LOM-Ir is a more preferred reaction pathway than the AEM for La3IrO7(001)-SLD, attributable to the favorable electronic band structure that volcanically relate to enhanced OER activity.

### **3. Conclusion**

In summary, we have reported that a novel La3IrO7-SLD electrocatalyst with enhanced OER activity, characterized by a low overpotential of 296 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> and excellent stability. DFT studies reveal that lattice oxygen participated mechanism with surface Ir atoms serving as active sites is followed by the La3IrO7(001)-SLD system, which is determined by the relatively lower energy level of active Ir 5d orbitals than that of ligand O 2p orbitals for La3IrO7(001)-SLD. It endows the enough activity of oxygen on SLD structure to participate in the catalytic cycle, and thus contributes to the higher OER activity. Impressively, the La3IrO7(001)-SLD owns high mass activity that is obviously superior to that of commercial IrO2. This study emphasizes that the improvement of durability can be realized without at expense of activity by rationally designing the OER electrocatalyst with new structure in acidic media.

### **ABSTRACT**

Transition metal-based electrocatalysts play a crucial role in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, their heavy reliance on free electrons at the *d*-band significantly limits the screening of potentially efficient, earth-abundant alternatives. Despite extensive exploration of catalyst engineering through multi-metal cooperation to modulate electron configuration by introducing additional transition metals, practical success remains elusive. Here, we present a straightforward electrodeposition method for preparing amorphous FeCoAl hydroxide catalysts. The introduction of Al contributes external free electrons, enabling a well-defined electron configuration for intermediate adsorption. Al doping also adjusts the *d*-band position of adjacent Co atoms, bringing them closer to the Fermi level and significantly enhancing intrinsic activity at the active sites. Furthermore, Al dopants facilitate rapid mass and charge transfer near the catalyst layer, promoting faster reaction kinetics. Leveraging these properties, the FeCoAl hydroxide catalyst achieves a large current density of 100 mAcm <sup>2</sup> at an overpotential of 340 mV, with a small Tafel slope of 29.1 mVdec <sup>1</sup> . Our work provides valuable insights for designing efficient electrocatalysts by leveraging free electron-rich metal doping and expanding the parameter space for catalyst engineering.

# **Introduction**

The environmental pollution and energy crisis caused by traditional fossil fuels are major issues that need to be addressed in today's society [\[1–3\]](#page-7-0). Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop a new, clean and renewable energy source to meet the sustainable development of human society. Hydrogen, as an environmentally friendly, sustainable, and storable clean energy source, is considered as the most promising alternative to fossil fuels. Electrochemical water splitting to produce hydrogen has become an important way to prepare hydrogen energy. Water splitting involves two half-reactions, namely hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), both of which need to be carried out under the catalysis of a catalyst to make the whole device efficiency [\[4–6\]](#page-7-0). Compared with HER, OER is carried out through a four– electron transfer pathway with delayed kinetics, accompanied by the breaking of O H bonds and the generation of O O bonds, resulting in larger overpotentials and poorer energy conversion rates [\[7\]](#page-7-0). Therefore, it is crucial to select appropriate catalysts for reducing overpotential and improving the kinetic performance of OER. At present, precious metal Ir and Ru based catalysts are excellent OER catalysts, due to low overpotential, high exchange current density, and significant

reaction stability [\[8,](#page-7-0) [9\]](#page-7-0), which can effectively reduce the hydrolysis energy barrier and improve the reaction rate. However, the scarce nature limits their large-scale application. Therefore, it is essential to focus on the development of nonprecious metal electrocatalytic materials.

Recently, transition metals have become potential OER electrocatalysts due to their stability under alkaline conditions, earth abundance, and relatively high activity [[10–](#page-7-0)[15\]](#page-8-0). In recent years, while conducting continuous research on various combinations of transition metal catalysts, researchers have found that due to the synergistic effect of Co and Fe, FeCo based oxides and (oxygen) hydroxides have emerged as highly active and stable OER electrocatalysts, with performance comparable to noble metal oxides [[16](#page-8-0)]. However, owing to the poor conductivity and limited active sites of FeCo based compounds, their long-term development is confined in OER and HER. Subsequently, researches showed that precise control of the electronic structure of catalysts could improve their conductivity, increase more active sites, and optimize the adsorption free energy of intermediate species on the catalyst surface, thereby enhance the intrinsic activity of active sites [[17–19](#page-8-0)]. Currently, the commonly used electronic control strategies include heteroatom doping, heterojunction interface construction, defect engineering, and phase control, etc. [[20](#page-8-0)–[22\]](#page-8-0). Among these regulation methods, heteroatom doping is the most promising approach. During the doping process, because of the different electronegativity between the foreign atoms and the host atoms, some electrons are attracted or given to the host atoms, thus adjusting the electronic configuration of transition metal compounds, increasing the exposed active sites, and optimizing absorption states. The incorporation of tradition metals such as Mn [[23\]](#page-8-0), Zn [\[24](#page-8-0)], W [[25\]](#page-8-0), and Zr [\[26](#page-8-0)] into FeCo based compound catalysts has been shown to enhance their activity and stability. At present, the number of free electrons in the outer layer of the catalyst is still insufficient, thus the adsorption of intermediates by active sites is limited. Recent study found that doping with Al<sup>3</sup><sup>+</sup>could alter the electronic structure of Fe3O4, causing a positive shift in its *d*-band center and improving the absorption of the catalytic surface for \*OOH intermediates. This results in Al doped Fe3O4 exhibited outstanding electrocatalytic performance with low overpotentials of 215 mV(η10) and 359 mV(η100) and a Tafel slope of 68 mVdec <sup>1</sup> toward OER [\[27](#page-8-0)].

Based on the above-mentioned considerations, in this work, we successfully synthesized an Al doped FeCo hydroxide catalyst on CP using electrodeposition method. Structural characterization indicated that the introduction of Al changed the morphology of the catalyst from irregular particles to regular flakes, regulated the valence states of surrounding ions, and resulted in excessive oxygen vacancies. As expected, the FeCoAl hydroxide catalyst exhibited excellent OER catalytic performance, with an overpotential of 340 mV and a Tafel slope of 29.1 mVdec <sup>1</sup> at 100 mAcm <sup>2</sup> . Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicated that the Co site was the active center of the OER, and the adsorption energy of optimized catalyst intermediates was conducive to the formation of \*OOH in the reaction step, resulting in accelerating the OER kinetics.

# **Experimental Section**

# **Chemicals**

All reagents were analytical grade without further purification. The carbon paper (CP, HCP020 N) used was bought from Hesen Electric Co., Shanghai China. Ferric (III) nitrate nonahydrate (Fe(NO3)3 · 9H2O), cobalt (II) nitrate hexahydrate (Co(NO3)2 · 6H2O), aluminum (III) nitrate nonahydrate (Al- (NO3)3 · 9H2O), absolute ethanol and potassium hydroxide (KOH) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Regent Co., Ltd. Deionized water was used throughout the experiment.

# **Characterizations**

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (SU8010) and an energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) were used for morphology and elemental composition analysis. The crystal structure of catalysts was obtained by X-ray diffraction (XRD) (D8 ADVNCE) technology. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was performed to test elemental composition and valence states using an Escalab Xi instrument with 150 W Al Kα power.

# **Synthesis of FeCoAl/CP Catalyst**

The FeCoAl/CP catalyst was prepared via electrodeposition using a parallel positioned platinum plate as a counter electrode, Ag/AgCl electrode as a reference electrode, and CP as carrier. The electrolyte for the deposition was composed of 2 mM Fe(NO3)3 · 9H2O, 2 mM Co(NO3)2 · 6H2O and 0.5 mM Al(NO3)3 · 9H2O, in a single-well electrolytic cell. The FeCoAl/ CP catalyst was obtained by i-t electrodeposition with an initial potential at 1.6 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) at 25°C for 400 s. After the deposition, the CP was removed from the electrolytic cell, washed three times with deionized water and absolute ethanol respectively, and then dried at the room temperature.

### **Synthesis of FeCo/CP Catalyst**

The electrolyte composition is 2 mM Fe(NO3)3 · 9H2O and 2 mM Co(NO3)2 · 6H2O, the synthesis strategy of FeCo/CP catalyst was similar to that of FeCoAl/CP.

### **Electrochemical Measurements**

All electrochemical measurements were carried out on a conventional three-electrode system by using a 660E electrochemical work-station at room temperature. A 1 cm2 area of asprepared electrocatalyst was used as the working electrode, platinum plate as a counter electrode, and Hg/HgO electrode as a reference electrode. The catalysts were tested in a singlewell electrolytic cell with 30 mL of a 1.0 M KOH aqueous solution as the electrolyte. The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curve was swept at a rate of 5 mVs 1 . Before testing, activated the sample by scanning the cyclic voltammetry (CV)

for 30 cycles to achieve stable state. In addition, all potentials were converted to a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), according to the Equation (1):

$$E_{RHE} = E_{Hg/HgO} + 0.0591 \times pH + 0.098 \tag{1}$$

The electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) is a testing method used to study the kinetics of electrode processes and surface phenomena in electrochemical reactions. The AC voltage amplitude used in the experiment was 5 mV, the testing frequency was  $0.01 \sim 100000$  Hz and the test potential interval was  $1.53 \sim 1.71$  V. The equivalent circuit diagram of R (Q (R)) was composed of the solution resistance (R<sub>s</sub>), charge transfer resistance (R<sub>ct</sub>) and interface capacitance (CPE). The mass transfer resistance of electrocatalysts could be evaluated by calculating the distribution of relaxation times (DRT) using EIS data [28].

In order to obtain the apparent activation energy ( $E_{app}$ ) of OER, CV measurements were conducted on the catalyst within a certain temperature range (25~65°C). According to the Arrhenius equation, the apparent activation energy is related to the current density, as shown in the Arrhenius Equation (2) [29, 30].

$$j = A_{app} \exp\left(-\frac{E_{app}}{RT}\right)$$
 (2)

where j is the current density of the CV curves (mA cm $^{-2}$ ),  $A_{app}$  represents the apparent pre-exponential factor, R is the ideal gas constant (8.314 JK $^{-1}$ mol $^{-1}$ ), T is the Kelvin temperature of the CV test process (K). After further converting to Equation (3) [30, 31],  $E_{app}$  can be calculated from the slope.

$$\left| \frac{\partial (\log_{10}(j))}{\partial (\frac{1}{I})} \right|_{n} = \frac{E_{\text{app}}}{2.303R}$$
 (3)

The voltammetry charge  $(q_v)$  is related to the activity of the catalyst and is obtained by calculating the average charge of CV curves at different scan rates [32]:

$$\frac{1}{q_{v}} = \frac{1}{q_{T}} + k_{1} v^{1/2} \tag{4}$$

$$q_v = q_0 + k_2 v^{-1/2} \tag{5}$$

where  $k_1$  and  $k_2$  are constants, v is the sweep rate of CV curves,  $q_T$  and  $q_o$  are the total charge and the outer charge, respectively.

### **Density Functional Theory (DFT) Calculations**

DFT calculations were carried out using the Vienna AB Initio Simulation Package (VASP) to study the catalytic potential of catalysts in electrocatalytic OER process [33]. The project augmented wave (PAW) described the electron-ion interactions, and the plane-wave kinetic energy cutoff was 500 eV. The Perdew-Burke-Enrzerhof (PBE) [34] functional of the generalized gradient app-roximation(GGA) [35] was used to describe the exchange-correlation energies. Here, we used a 3×3×1 Monkhorst Pack grid for calculation. The vacuum layer thick was 20 Å and the Fermi level was set to zero as the

energy reference. The Gibbs free energy of the OER intermediates is corrected by zero-point energy (ZPE) and entropy (S):

$$G = E + ZPE - TS \tag{6}$$

where E represents the total energy calculated by DFT, S is the entropy difference between the products and reactants, and the T is Kelvin temperature (T = 298.15 K).

#### **Results and Discussion**

## Morphological and Structural Characterization

The experimental section details the preparation process of the FeCo/CP and FeCoAl/CP catalysts via electrodeposition, Morphological characterization by SEM of the as-prepared samples was shown in Figure 1a~b and Figure S1~4. It could be seen the CP surface was fully covered by irregular particle of FeCo which was aggregated in a random way (Figure 1a), when Al was introduced into the electrochemical system, the appearance of FeCoAl/CP (Figure 1b) became regular, and was as flake-like. The addition of Al<sup>3+</sup> changed the composition of the electrolyte, thereby affecting its morphology. Compared with Figure S5, elemental mappings further confirmed the successful introduction of Al in FeCo/CP (Figure S6).

According to the XRD spectra (Figure 1c), FeCo/CP and FeCoAl/CP demonstrated no other signals except for the two diffraction peaks of CP at 26.5° and 54.6°, indicating that the two electrocatalysts deposited on the CP were in an amorphous state. The XPS method was employed to further analyze the elemental composition and electronic structure of the samples (Figure 1d~h). As seen in Figure 1d, the XPS peaks of elements Co, Fe, and O for FeCo/CP and Co, Fe, Al, and O for FeCoAl/CP were detected, which were in consistent with the EDX elemental mapping observations (Figure S5, 6). The XPS core spectrum of Co 2p and Fe 2p for FeCo/CP and FeCoAl/CP exhibited similar curves (Figure 1e and 1f). In Figure 1e, the Fe 2p XPS spectra of FeCo/CP were deconvoluted to give two major peaks located at 711.2 eV (Fe 2p<sub>3/2</sub>) and 724.6 eV (Fe  $2p_{1/2}$ ), confirming the existence of Fe<sup>3+</sup>. However, the Fe 2p peaks of FeCoAl/CP shifted to lower binding energy by 0.5 eV compared with that of FeCo/CP, implying that a part of Fe<sup>3+</sup> was converted to Fe<sup>2+</sup>. The Co 2p XPS spectra of FeCo/CP (Figure 1f) displayed a pair of peaks at binding energies of 780.1 eV (Co 2p<sub>3/2</sub>) and 796.1 eV (Co 2p<sub>1/2</sub>), which suggested the existence of Co<sup>2+</sup>. While compared to FeCo/CP, the Co 2p peak of FeCoAl/CP moved toward higher binding energy by 0.6 eV, which could be the result of electron transfer from Co to Fe. Therefore, Al doping could alter the charge distribution around Fe and Co atoms. The high-resolution 2p spectrum of Al appeared as a single peak at 74.5 eV assigned to the Al (III) oxidation state in Figure 1h. In addition, the peaks at around 529.3 eV and 530.8 eV in the O 1s spectrum can be identified with mental oxide bonds and oxygen vacancies, respectively (Figure 1g). For FeCoAl/CP, the peak area ratio at 530.8 eV was larger than that of FeCo/ CP, indicating that more oxygen vacancies were generated.

Oxygen vacancies, as electronic charge carrier, could enhance the conductivity of catalysts. Therefore, Al doping contributed to the formation of oxygen vacancies, which could further accelerate OER kinetics.

### **OER Catalytic Performance**

The electrochemical performance tests were conducted to study the OER activity of catalysts (Figure [2\)](#page-4-0). The LSV curves of

<span id="page-4-0"></span>**FIGURE 2** | The oxygen evolution performance testing of samples: (a) the LSV curves with 95% iR compensation; (b) overpotential values of different current densities; (c) Tafel plots; (d) EIS Nyquist plots measured at 1.58 V (vs. RHE); the inset is the fitting equivalent circuit diagram; (e) ECSA values of as-prepared catalysts; (f) The current density with different mass loading amount at 2.23 V (vs. RHE); (g) The plot of applied overpotential vs Log(1/Rct). (h) Catalytic stability test by chronopotentiometric curves of the as-prepared catalysts FeCoAl0.5/CP at 10 mAcm <sup>2</sup> over 20 h.

different catalysts were shown in Figure 2a, which indicated that the introduction of Al<sup>3</sup><sup>+</sup> in a certain range was beneficial for reducing overpotential and improving activity in the OER. From the Figure 2b, the catalyst FeCoAl0.5/CP exhibited the lowest overpotentials of 306, 317, 329, 335 and 340 mV to reach current densities from 10 to 100 mAcm <sup>2</sup> (Basic data were listed in Table S1). In addition, the overpotential of FeCoAl0.5/ CP catalyst at 100 mAcm <sup>2</sup> was only 340 mV, much smaller than that of FeCo/CP (656 mV), indicating its potential application in high current catalytic materials. The value of Tafel slope can reflect the intrinsic activity of the electrocatalyst. The low Tafel slope means that the catalyst has fast catalytic kinetic processes and good intrinsic activity in OER. The FeCoAl0.5/CP displayed the smallest Tafel slope of 29.1 mVdec <sup>1</sup> , suggesting that it possessed the fastest reaction kinetics (Figure 2c). EIS was further collected to reflect the OER kinetic of catalysts. The Rct values of the electrocatalysts were estimated to be 3.2, 2.36, 2.49, and 1.88 Ω for FeCo/CP, FeCoAl0.3/CP, FeCoAl0.5/CP, and FeCoAl1/CP, respectively, implying Al doping can reduce charge transfer resistance and boost the catalytic performance of catalysts (Figure 2d). Furthermore, electrochemical surface area (ECSA), determined by the double layer capacitance (Cdl), is used to reveal the catalytic mechanism. Figure S7–S9 were CV curves of CP, FeCo/CP and FeCoAl0.5/CP in a non-Faradaic region with different scan rates. The Cdl extracted from the CV curves for CP, FeCo/CP and FeCoAl0.5/CP were calculated to be 0.021,0.16, and 0.026 mFcm <sup>2</sup> , respectively (Figure 2e). The results illustrated that the high catalytic activity of the FeCoAl0.5/CP catalyst was due to the high intrinsic activity of its active sites, rather than the high ECSA. In order to further investigate the intrinsic activity, we calculated the influence of different catalyst mass loadings on OER performance. As seen in Figure 2f, the electrochemical activity of FeCoAl0.5/CP and FeCo/CP increased as the mass loading increased, and the mass loading of FeCoAl0.5/CP was larger.

<span id="page-5-0"></span>The value of Tafel slope calculated from LSV data does not fully evaluate the impact of electron transfer in the catalyst on OER performance [\[36](#page-8-0)]. Therefore, we further used EIS data to calculate the Tafel slope and explore the OER activity of the catalyst. Figure S10 and S11 were EIS curves of FeCo/CP and FeCoAl0.5/CP measured at different overpotentials. As shown in Figure [2g](#page-4-0), the Tafel slope was 189.7 mVdec <sup>1</sup> for FeCoAl0.5/ CP, smaller than that of FeCo/CP (260.2 mVdec <sup>1</sup> ), suggesting FeCoAl0.5/CP possesses intrinsic high activity in the OER. Additionally, Chronopotentiometric measurement of Fe-CoAl0.5/CP at a constant current of 10 mAcm <sup>2</sup> has been applied to evaluate its stability in OER. As shown in Figure [2h,](#page-4-0) the potential of FeCoAl0.5/CP maintained at approximately 1.6 V for 20 h without significant degradation, indicating the high electrocatalytic stability of FeCoAl0.5/CP.

The pseudocapacitance of FeCoAl0.5/CP catalyst accelerates the accumulation of charge during the OER process. A CV measurement is used for calculation of total and outer charge (Figure S12 and S13). Figure S12a and S13a were CV curves of FeCo/CP and FeCoAl0.5/CP at different sweep rates which were employed for calculation of the total and outer charge. According to Equation (5), the q*<sup>v</sup>* as a function of sweep rate was expected to increase linearly with *v* 1/2 and the intercept of the linear fitting curve was the outer charge. The outer charge for FeCo/CP and FeCoAl0.5/CP derived from Figure S12b and S13b were 133 μC and 627 μC respectively. Similarly, based on Equation (4), <sup>1</sup> qv as a function of sweep rate was increased linearly with *v*1/2, and the intercept of the linear fitted line was the total surface charge. The total surface charge for FeCo/CP and FeCoAl0.5/CP calculated by Figure S12c and S13c were 444 μC and 936 μC respectively (Table S2). It was apparent that the outer charge and the total surface charge increased with Al doping.

The reaction rate depends on the reaction activation energy barrier, therefore, Eapp is an important parameter to evaluate OER kinetics. The electrocatalytic performance of the catalyst was improved with the decrease of the activation energy. The CV curves at different temperatures (25~65 °C) of FeCo/CP and FeCoAl0.5/CP were shown in Figure S14a and S15a, respectively. As seen in Figure S14b and S15b, the Arrhenius diagram of the FeCo/CP and FeCoAl0.5/CP were constructed according to the current density recorded at a series of given overpotentials. The different slopes represented the Eapp of catalysts under various overpotentials.

As seen in Figure 3a, the Eapp was related to the overpotential, and decreased with the increasement of overpotential. The OER activation energy of FeCoAl0.5/CP electrocatalyst was dramatically reduced by contrast with the FeCo/CP electrocatalyst, indicating that the OER electrocatalytic performance of FeCo/CP electrocatalyst was obviously improved after introduction of Al.

The distribution of DRT was employed to directly analyze EIS data which distinguished dynamic characteristics based on time constants. The DRT diagrams revealed that there were two different physical processes occurred during the OER

**FIGURE 3** | (a) Eapp at a series of given overpotentials for FeCo/CP and FeCoAl0.5/CP. (b~d) DRT analysis of the EIS data measured at different overpotentials of 320, 360 and 400 mV, respectively.

<span id="page-6-0"></span>catalytic process. The mechanism of OER was comprised of three steps: transfer of reactants to the electrode surface, adsorption of reaction intermediates by catalysts and charge transfer [\[37](#page-8-0)]. In the DRT curves, the low-frequency region represented the mass transfer process, while the highfrequency region indicated the charge transfer process. There was a linear relationship between frequency and relaxation times (τ), with an increase in frequency leading to a decrease in τ [[38\]](#page-8-0). The DRT curves at three different overpotentials (320, 360 and 400 mV) were shown in Figure [3b,](#page-5-0) [c](#page-5-0) [and](#page-5-0) d, respectively. There were two obvious characteristic peaks corresponding to high and low τ, and the area decreased at low τ with the increasement of the overpotential, which manifested that applying a high overpotential reduced charge transfer resistance and were more conducive to the catalytic reactions. At high *τ*, the peak area of FeCoAl0.5/CP decreased compared with that of FeCo/CP, suggesting that FeCoAl0.5/CP possess excellent charge transfer kinetics and can reduce the transfer resistance of electroactive species.

# **DFT Calculations in OER Catalytic Mechanism of FeCoAl0.5/CP Hydroxides**

In order to theoretically verify the effect of Al doping, DFT calculations were used to further analyze the catalyst structure, electronic state and adsorption energy of intermediate species in the OER. Figure S16~18 and Figure 4a summarized all the basic steps involved in the OER process, including the process flowchart and the structure diagram of adsorption intermediates, and we could find that Co was the active site of the intermediates during the reaction process. The free energy spectrum was shown in Figure 4b, each electrochemical step of the catalyst in the OER process was an endothermic process under the condition of U=0 eV. In the OER, the reaction step with the highest reaction free energy barrier (ΔG) was the main standard for evaluating the feasibility of reaction occurrence and was defined as the rate determining step (RDS). The ΔG on Fe/CP, FeCo/CP, FeAl/CP and FeCoAl0.5/CP oxide surfaces were 2.33, 1.98, 2.10 and 1.73 eV, respectively,

**FIGURE 4** | (a) Crystal structure of FeCoAl0.5/CP and the corresponding atomic configurations of OER. The blue, gray, brown, red and white balls represent Co, Al, Fe, O and H atoms, respectively. (b) Free energy diagram for the four steps of the OER. (c) Differential charge density diagram of FeCoAl0.5/CP. Specially, the yellow area represents electron aggregation, and the cyan area represents electron loss (d) Projected density of state for FeCo/CP. (e) Projected density of state for FeCoAl0.5/CP.

<span id="page-7-0"></span>which implied overpotentials (η) of 1.10, 0.75, 0.87 V and 0.50 V(η=(ΔG-1.23 eV)/e). Generally, the intrinsic activity towards OER performance was greatly improved along with the decreasement of ΔG value in RDS. The third step of FeCoAl0.5/CP catalyst involving the conversion \*O to \*OOH species possesses the lowest ΔG. The overpotential of the FeCoAl0.5/CP is far below the theoretical overpotential (0.56 V) of commercial IrO2 catalysts in alkaline conditions, which all indicate that Al doping is favorable for reducing reaction barriers. Charge density difference analysis was performed to reveal the effect of Al doping on the electronic states around Co atoms in FeCo/CP catalysts (Figure [4c\)](#page-6-0). The analysis results indicated that the doping effect of Al in FeCoAl0.5/CP led to charge density differences. Especially, the decrease in electron cloud density around Co sites, manifesting charge depletion, which promoted electron transfer and optimized the adsorption strength of intermediates.

The influence of Al introduction on the electronic structure of the system was investigated by calculating the projected density of states (PDOS). As seen in Figure [4d](#page-6-0) and [e](#page-6-0), the purple [dashed](#page-6-0) line represents the *d*-band center (Ed) of the adsorption site Co atoms, and the green dashed line represents the Fermi level (Ef ). Within the selected energy range, there was no obvious band gap near the Ef , implying the metallic properties of the catalysts. Figure [4d](#page-6-0) showed that the d orbital of Fe positioned near the Ef contributed the highest density of states. After doping with Al, the d orbital of Co located near the Ef dedicated a higher density of states per atom than Fe (Figure [4e](#page-6-0)), indicating that the Al dopant promoted charge transfer at the active site during the catalytic process [\[39\]](#page-8-0). The Ed energy level determines the stability and strength of adsorption bonding in the OER [\[40\]](#page-9-0). The Ed energy level ( 0.81 eV) of the Co atom in FeCoAl0.5/CP hydroxides shifted upwards relative to FeCo/CP ( 1.44 eV), indicating that the antibonding energy states raised and thus the interaction between adsorbates and FeCoAl0.5/CP hydroxides surface was strengthened [\[41](#page-9-0)]. Therefore, less electrons were filled into antibonding states, thereby enhancing the adsorption capacity of oxygen-containing intermediates, which was the key to the optimal adsorption/desorption ability of FeCoAl0.5/CP hydroxide catalysts.

# **Conclusion**

In summary, we designed an Al atom doping strategy to enhance the OER performance of FeCo hydroxide catalysts in alkaline electrolytes. We found that doping Al into FeCo hydroxide could adjust the morphology of nanoparticles, increase the number of active sites, tune the electronic structure, thereby accelerating charge transfer and mass transfer on the OER surface, effectively improving the intrinsic activity of active sites. The results indicated that the FeCoAl hydroxide catalyst possessed excellent OER activity, with an overpotential of 340 mV and a Tafel slope of 29.1 mVdec <sup>1</sup> at 100 mAcm <sup>2</sup> . DFT calculations demonstrated that the Co site was the OER reaction center of FeCoAl hydroxide catalyst, and the doping of Al greatly reduced the OER reaction barrier. This work provided theoretical basis for the rational design and optimization of the electronic structure of actual water electrolysis electrocatalysts.

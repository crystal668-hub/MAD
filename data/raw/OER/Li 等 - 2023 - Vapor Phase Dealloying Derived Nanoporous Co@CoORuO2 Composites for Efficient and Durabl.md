**The development of low-cost and effective oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts to expedite the slow kinetics of water splitting is crucial for increasing the efficiency of energy conversion from electricity to hydrogen fuel. Herein, 3D bicontinuous nanoporous Co@CoO/RuO2 composites with tunable sizes and chemical compositions are fabricated by introducing vapor phase dealloying of cobalt-based alloys. The influence of physical parameters on the formation of nanoporous Co substrates with various feature ligament sizes is systematically investigated. The CoO/RuO2 shell is constructed by integrating a thin layer of RuO2 on the inner surface of nanoporous Co, where the CoO interlayer is formed by annealing oxidization. The composite catalyst delivers an ultralow overpotential of 198 mV at 10 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2, Tafel slope of 57.1 mV dec−<sup>1</sup> , and long-term stability of 50 h. The superior OER activity and fast reaction kinetics are attributed to charge transfer through the coupling of CoORu bonds at the interface and the excellent nanopore connectivity, while the durability originates from the highly stable CoO/RuO2 interface.**

## **1. Introduction**

The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is crucial in green electrochemical energy conversion processes, such as water splitting, metal-air cells, and fuel cells, and can significantly alleviate the current energy shortage.[1–4] However, the slow kinetics of the OER involving four-electron transfer still require large amounts of rare Ir/Rubased noble metal oxides to drive it to a sufficient current density.[5–7] At present, considerable efforts have been devoted to exploring various 3d transition metalbased electrocatalysts, such as oxides, phosphides, and sulfides.[8] Nevertheless, the OER activity and stability of non-noble metal-based catalysts are still inferior to the precious metal benchmarks, requiring it to develop effective strategies to boost their intrinsic activity, active site density, and durability.[9–11] Nanoporous metals, as

structural-functional integrated materials, possess a 3D bicontinuous open porous structure and high specific surface area, facilitating mass transport inside the internal porous channels for applications in OER electrocatalysis.[12–16] More importantly, nanoporous substrates are readily integrated with other active species, thus allowing the templating strategy to precisely control the loading amounts and interfacial structures, further improving the catalytic performance.[17–20]

In the past two decades, the dealloying approach has been an effective technique for obtaining porous metallic catalysts[21–24] and can be classified into chemical/electrochemical dealloying,[25–27] liquid metal dealloying,[28–30] and vapor phase dealloying (VPD).[31–34] The ligament size, porosity, and chemical components of dealloyed nanoporous metals can be tailored by altering the dealloying condition and precursor alloy composition.[35–38] Nevertheless, for liquid phase dealloying, the resultant products are mainly nanoporous noble or nonactive metals, such as Au, Pt, Ta, W, etc., owing to dealloying being a chemical corrosion process in essence.[39,40] VPD utilizes the difference in saturated vapor pressure between the constituent elements of the alloy to selectively remove high fractional vapor pressure components to form nanoporous architectures.[41] It has been demonstrated that VPD method can produce nanoporous structures from multiple types of elements without **www.advancedsciencenews.com www.afm-journal.de**

having to consider their chemical activity, miscibility, or conductivity. In addition, the evaporated sacrificial components can be recycled, avoiding the environmental pollution caused by the etching process. For the application of VPD, nanoporous Sb with an adjustable size was obtained by evaporation of zinc from a Zn–Sb alloy, which was smaller than the porous Sb prepared by chemical dealloying,[42] and enhanced electrochemical performance as a potassium-ion battery (KIB) anode was attained.[43] Moreover, Han et al. fabricated porous Ni for the one-pot growth of 3D nanoporous graphene and porous Ge as an anode material for lithium-ion batteries, exhibiting the potential application in the field of energy storage.[44] From a literature review, research on the preparation of nanoporous metals using the VPD technique has just begun. Previous works have mainly focused on the thermodynamics and kinetics, but have not examined the application of catalytic materials.[31,44,45] In this study, we fabricated nanoporous Co (np-Co) with tunable ligament sizes by controlling the dealloying temperature, time, and ambient pressure and further integrated a RuO2 thin shell to form np-Co@CoO/RuO2 composite catalysts to improve the OER activity and stability.

#### **2. Results and Discussion**

The VPD setup is composed of a furnace, vacuum pump, and condenser, as shown in **Scheme 1**. The details of the VPD method can be found in the Supporting Information. A Co5Zn21 alloy is selected as a precursor alloy to fabricate the np-Co (Figures S1 and S2, Supporting Information). In general, the 3D bicontinuous np-Co was prepared at high temperature and low pressure (Figure S3, Supporting Information). The Co ligaments possess negative and positive curvatures with abundant low-coordination sites on the inner surface to load RuO2. Subsequently, the np-Co@CoO/RuO2 composite catalyst was fabricated by depositing RuO2 on the np-Co substrate with a RuCl3 alcoholic solution as a precursor, followed by an annealing oxidization process.

The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images in **Figure 1**a show the morphologies of np-Co and np-Co@CoO/RuO2. The decorated RuO2 shell perfectly inherits the bicontinuous structure of np-Co. Compared to the as-prepared np-Co, the mean size of the ligament increased slightly after the surface modification of RuO2 species. Figure 1b presents the X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns of the np-Co and np-Co@CoO/RuO2 samples. The np-Co has a face-centered cubic (fcc) structure with diffraction peaks at 44.2°, 51.5°, and 75.8°, indexed to the (111), (200), and (220) planes. Due to the presence of solute oxygen in the precursor alloy, the oxygen element diffuses and reacts with the surface Co during VPD, leading to a weak characteristic peak of CoO at 39.3°. The XRD result of np-Co@CoO/RuO2 indicates that the loaded Ru is in the form of the RuO2 phase, and the diffraction peaks of the inner Co phase are still dominant. The high-angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) image and corresponding energy disperse spectroscopy (EDS) mappings clearly show the elemental distribution of Co, Ru, and O in the np-Co@CoO/RuO2 composite (Figure 1c). The Ru and O elements are uniformly distributed on the inner surface of the np-Co ligaments, suggesting the core of np-Co and the shell of CoO/RuO2, respectively. The overall EDS result is consistent with the inductively coupled plasma (ICP) measurement (Figure S4, Supporting Information).

Prior to fabricating the composite catalyst, constructing nanoporous structures with small ligament sizes and high porosity with good connectivity can remarkably improve the inner surface area and mass transfer rate, as well as lead to an attainable interfacial area for creating active sites. We systematically investigated the dealloying temperature, time, and pressure that greatly influence the eventual morphology and residual Zn concentration of dealloyed nanoporous products. Since Zn vacancies and the resultant nanopores are readily formed in the Co5Zn21 alloy at high temperature and low pressure, appropriate dealloying parameters will trigger the selective evaporation of Zn from the alloy, while Co remains to form a nanoporous skeleton. However, it is difficult to initiate dealloying at a temperature below 723 K, and further increasing the temperature will dramatically accelerate Zn evaporation; thus, we selected a reasonable dealloying temperature range from 723 to 773, 823, and 873 K. **Figure 2**a–d shows the crosssectional SEM images at different dealloying temperatures with a constant dealloying time of 60 min and a pressure of 120 Pa.

It can be seen that the nanoporous structure distributes uniformly across the entire sample. At 723 K, it was found that the ligament size of np-Co is ≈78 nm, and the residual Zn content is 6.5 at.%. With the increase in the dealloying temperature, the ligament sizes of the dealloyed np-Co show obvious coarsening to 179, 365, and 587 nm, and the residual Zn content gradually decreases and finally reaches ≈4.8 at.%, as shown in Figure 2i. In this work, more than 200 ligaments in the SEM images were counted, and the average ligament size was calculated by Gaussian curve fitting. As the temperature increases from 723 to 873 K, the reduction rate of residual Zn content becomes slower and the coarsening rate of ligament increases, resulting in a decrease in porosity from 52% to 41%, which means that mass transfer may become progressively worse (Figure S5, Supporting Information).

Since a low environmental pressure promotes Zn volatilization and a lower dealloying temperature depresses Co diffusion, dealloying under higher vacuum and lower temperatures can fabricate np-Co with a smaller ligament size and larger porosity. This is due to the effect of the environmental pressure on the rate-limiting dealloying mechanism, changing from a bulk diffusion-controlled process under a low vacuum to a surface diffusion-controlled process under a high vacuum. [41] Based on the above analyses, we performed the dealloying experiments at an optimal temperature of 723 K and under a low vacuum of  $10^{-4}$  Pa. Figure 2e—h and Figure S6 (Supporting Information) show the cross-sectional SEM images at different dealloying

times from 10 to 180 min. Within 20 min, it was found that there was still a solid structure inside, suggesting that dealloying was not accomplished (Figure S7, Supporting Information). After 30 min, the nanoporous structure largely permeates the global sample. The ligament size of np-Co is only 58 nm, while the residual Zn content is as high as 10.5 at.%. With the extension of the dealloying time from 60 to 90, 120, and 180 min, the ligament size of np-Co coarsens from 69 to 75, 79, and 84 nm, and the residual Zn content gradually decreases and finally reaches ≈4.6 at.% (Figure 2j). As the dealloying time increases, ligament coarsening accelerates and the residual Zn content is gradually reduced, leading to a decline in porosity from 54% to 46% (Figure S8, Supporting Information). These experimental results well support that the regulation over a wide range of ligament sizes and porosity can be realized by altering the dealloying parameters.

To evaluate the OER properties of the VPD-derived np-Co@CoO/RuO<sub>2</sub> catalyst with various nanoporous structures, we performed electrocatalytic tests on the nanoporous composite catalyst and commercial RuO<sub>2</sub> catalyst. The OER electrocatalytic performance of the prepared samples was evaluated in a standard three-electrode system with an alkaline electrolyte. As seen from the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves in **Figure 3**a, the np-Co@CoO/RuO<sub>2</sub> catalyst obtained by dealloying had a lower overpotential, which was better than that of commercial RuO<sub>2</sub>. The residual amount of Zn is still greater than 10 at.% for a dealloying time of 30 min, which may

explain the poor OER performance of np-Co<sub>30min</sub>@CoO/RuO<sub>2</sub>. For the remaining samples, the overpotential of np-Co@CoO/ RuO2 shifted to the right in increasing order with increasing dealloying time. The optimum np-Co<sub>60min</sub>@CoO/RuO<sub>2</sub> sample had an overpotential of 1.428 V at 10 mA  $cm^{-2}$ , a boost of 84 mV compared to that of RuO<sub>2</sub> (1.512 V). In the comparison of these samples, np-Co<sub>60min</sub>@CoO/RuO<sub>2</sub> presented the lowest overpotentials of 198, 238, and 283 mV at various current densities of 10, 50, and 200 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, respectively (Figure 3b). The overpotentials for a high current density of 1000 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> (corresponding to the working current density of commercial electrolyzers) are also compared, where the np-Co<sub>60min</sub>@CoO/RuO<sub>2</sub> shows a better activity, requiring the overpotential of only 361 and 439 mV to achieve 500 and 1000 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, respectively (Figure S9a,b, Supporting Information). Figure 3c shows the Tafel slopes of the prepared samples, which follow the same trend as the LSV curves, with np-Co60min@CoO/RuO2 having the lowest Tafel slope of 57.1 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>. In addition, we compare the nanoporous composites with the state-of-art Ru-based (including RuO<sub>2</sub>) and Co-based OER catalysts. The np-Co<sub>60min</sub>@CoO/RuO<sub>2</sub> is superior to most of the recently reported Ru or Co-based material systems (Table S1, Supporting Information). In this work, a large number of interfaces of CoO/RuO2 are established on the inner surface of np-Co<sub>60min</sub>@CoO/RuO<sub>2</sub>, which act as electron acceptors to efficiently boost electrophilic OER catalysis. We will analyze the interfacial effect later. Moreover, the bicontinuous nanopores and high porosity are conducive to mass transport and electrolyte accessibility.

Figure 3d illustrates the Nyquist plots obtained by measuring the electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS), depicting the corresponding charge transfer resistance (Rct) semicircles for various np-Co@CoO/RuO2 catalysts and RuO2, with the smallest semicircle for np-Co<sub>60min</sub>@CoO/RuO<sub>2</sub> indicating the lowest response charge transfer resistance and a faster electron transfer process. The equivalent electrical circuit diagram used for fitting is shown in Figure S10 (Supporting Information). The electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) of the nanoporous catalysts was further investigated by testing the doublelayer capacitance ( $C_{d1}$ ) (Figure 3e), which was calculated from cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves at different scan rates from 20 to 100 mV s<sup>-1</sup> (Figure S11, Supporting Information). The np-Co60min@CoO/RuO2 composite has a small ligament size, exhibiting the highest  $C_{\rm dl}$  (22.50 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>). As the ligament size further increased,  $C_{\rm dl}$  decreased, and the corresponding ECSA continued to decrease. The  $C_{\rm dl}$  values of np-Co $_{
m 90min}$ @CoO/RuO $_{
m 2}$ and np-Co<sub>120min</sub>@CoO/RuO<sub>2</sub> were 20.00 and 17.05 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>, respectively. From the electrochemical results, it was evident that the increase in the catalytic activity of the OER was closely related to the change in the ECSA of the electrocatalyst. The stability of the catalyst was assessed using constant chronopotentiometry measurements, as shown in Figure 3f. The np-Co60min@CoO/RuO2 catalyst could be stable at an overpotential near 1.428 V with operation at a constant current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> for > 50 h. In contrast, the RuO<sub>2</sub> and np-Co@CoO counterparts displayed continuously increased potential and overflows during a short testing period. A good overlap of the OER polarization curve with the initial curve is observed after 1000 cycles of CV, demonstrating the excellent catalytic durability of np-Co60min@CoO/RuO2 (Figure S12, Supporting Information). The long-term durability of np-Co<sub>60min</sub>@CoO/ RuO2 was further measured by performing the chronopotentiometry test at high currents of 500 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. After the 50 h test, the high activity remained well with a negligible attenuation of overpotential even in the high current density range. The complete morphology and EDS show that np-Co<sub>60min</sub>@CoO/RuO<sub>2</sub> mainly retains the original microstructure of nanoporous and element content after stability testing (Figures S13 and S14, Supporting Information). The XRD, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and Raman spectra were performed to examine the chemical state of the precatalytic and postcatalytic np-Co<sub>60min</sub>@CoO/RuO<sub>2</sub> (Figures S15-S17, Supporting Information). There is no obvious position alternation observed from both the Ru species and Co species for the catalyst after the long period of catalysis and no new phases were produced (Figure S17, Supporting Information). The postcatalytic analysis conforms to the excellent stability in the prolonged OER reaction and is the potential candidate for practical OER electrolysis. [46-48] Based on the analyses of the structure-effect relationship, we can purposefully modulate the ligament/pore size and associated loading amount of RuO2 of the nanoporous composite to obtain the desired catalyst with highly dense heterointerfaces through a VPD strategy.

To understand the origin of the OER activity and durability of the np-Co@CoO/RuO<sub>2</sub> composite, we conducted an analysis of the atomic and electronic structures at the interfaces by combining aberration-corrected TEM with electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS). As shown in Figure 4a,d, a thin layer of CoO/RuO<sub>2</sub> with a thickness of 6 nm was coated on the curved inner surface of dealloyed np-Co. In Figure 4b,c, high-resolution TEM images of the composite interfaces exhibit a zigzag characteristic with atomic-level tight bonding of Ru, O, and Co atoms at the interface. The inserted fast-Fourier transform (FFT) image shows the interfacial phases on the CoO/RuO<sub>2</sub> shell. The {111} lattice spacing of the interlayer CoO is 0.24 nm, smaller than the standard parameter 0.25 nm, demonstrating a tight bond with RuO<sub>2</sub> and producing the compressive strain. This strain tendency is consistent with a slight shift to the right of the CoO characteristic peak in XRD. The interfacial strained condition has been reported to improve the catalytic activities and stability.[49,50]

From the shell to the core (from point 1 to point 4), the  $L_{2,3}$ peaks of Co start from being absent and increase continuously. Point 3 has a larger  $L_3/L_2$ -ratio than point 4, demonstrating the transition from the interlayer CoO to the metallic Co core.[51] The  $L_3$  peak of Ru at the CoO/RuO<sub>2</sub> interface (points 2 and 3) shows a small shift to the low energy loss direction compared to the outer layer of RuO2 (point 1), indicating a reduction in the Ru valence at the interface. Evolving from the surface to the interface, it was found that the electronic state of the O atom when it combines with the Co atom (points 2 and 3) is different from that when it combines with the Ru atom (point 1). For the O-K edge, the characteristic peak "a", which represents the hybridization of the O 2p state with Co 3d and Co 4s in CoO, gradually strengthens (Figure 4e).<sup>[6]</sup> Importantly, it is evident that the O atoms rehybridize with the Co and Ru atoms at the interface (points 2 and 3) caused by concurrent connection with Co and Ru atoms, indicating O ions play a dominant role in the reduction of Ru valence through the electronic coupling among

Ru, O, and Co atom at the interface. In addition, high density stacking faults as the crystal defects in Co ligaments could act as reactant adsorption sites and are also beneficial for improving the catalytic activity (Figure S18, Supporting Information). XPS was also performed to measure the valence state of Co and Ru on the surface of the np-Co@CoO/RuO2 sample. Figure 4f illustrates the XPS spectrum of Co, where the fitted peaks for Co 2p3/2 are attributed to Co<sup>2</sup>+ (781 eV) and Co<sup>0</sup> (775 eV), and the satellite peak is labeled near 786 eV. The weak peak of Co0 is from the metallic Co core, and most of the Co showing +2 valence is attributed to the CoO shell layer on the nanoporous structure. In the Ru 3*p* core-level spectrum, the peak near 462.8 eV is slightly lower than Ru 3*p*3/2 of the standard Ru4+, while the oxidation state Ru4+ was dominantly derived from the outermost layer RuO2, which is tightly bound to the interlayer of CoO. The O 1*s* XPS spectra can be deconvoluted into three peaks centered near 530.2, 532.0, and 532.7 eV, corresponding to the lattice oxygen (O1), surface absorbed oxygen (O2), and water molecules adsorbed on the surface (O3), respectively (Figure S19, Supporting Information). It could be observed that the lattice oxygen species are highest from the O 1s spectra, indicating the strong coupling of the CoORu bond.

Based on the above Results and Discussion, the high electrochemical activity of np-Co@CoO/RuO2 toward OER can be ascribed to the following aspects: i) the nanoporous Co precursor can effectively capture and uniformly disperse Ru<sup>3</sup><sup>+</sup> on the np-Co surface, which leads to the as-obtained np-Co@CoO/RuO2 with an abundance of available surface atoms for the OER reaction; ii) the 3D hollowed-out nanoporous structure of Co@CoO/RuO2 provides plenty of accessible active sites and an easier mass transfer during the OER process; iii) the strong synergistic coupling effect of CoORu bands in the composites further improves the electrocatalytic activity.

### **3. Conclusion**

In summary, we fabricated a 3D bicontinuous nanoporous Co@CoO/RuO2 composite with controllable ligament sizes by employing the physical VPD method via regulation of the dealloying temperature, time, and ambient pressure. The composite catalyst has a low overpotential of 198 mV at 10 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2, an 84 mV improvement over that of commercial RuO2, and catalytic durability of over 50 h. Combining the characterizations of structural and chemical properties, the activity and stability of the nanoporous catalysts are verified from the charge transfer through the coupling of CoORu bonds at the interface, outstanding nanopore connectivity, and the highly stable CoO/ RuO2 interface. The precise regulation of the ligament size and interfacial active species provides powerful support for the functionalization of VPD applications.

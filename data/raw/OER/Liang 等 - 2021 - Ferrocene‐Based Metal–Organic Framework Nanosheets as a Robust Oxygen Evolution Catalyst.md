Abstract: We report the synthesis of two-dimensional metalorganic frameworks (MOFs) on nickel foam (NF) by assembling nickel chloride hexahydrate and 1,1'-ferrocenedicarboxylic acid (NiFc-MOF/NF). The NiFc-MOF/NF exhibits superior oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance with an overpotential of 195 mV and 241 mV at 10 and 100 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, respectively under alkaline conditions. Electrochemical results demonstrate that the superb OER performance originates from the ferrocene units that serve as efficient electron transfer intermediates. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the ferrocene units within the MOF crystalline structure enhance the overall electron transfer capacity, thereby leading to a theoretical overpotential of 0.52 eV, which is lower than that (0.81 eV) of the state-of-the-art NiFe double hydroxides.

Hydrogen is a very desirable energy carrier, owing to its environmental friendliness, high weight-specific energy density, and cleanness at point of use. Among various strategies of hydrogen production, electrolysis of water is one of the simplest and cleanest approaches.<sup>[1]</sup> However, industrialization of this technology is still hindered by the sluggish half reaction of water splitting, that is, oxygen evolution reaction (OER), a rate-controlling step that requires a large overpotential to deliver an appreciable amount of current.<sup>[2]</sup> Currently, iridium dioxide (IrO<sub>2</sub>) and ruthenium dioxide (RuO<sub>2</sub>) are regarded as effective OER catalysts, but the high cost and the instability in alkaline conditions of these precious catalysts have severely obstructed their practical applications.<sup>[3]</sup>

Increasing research efforts have been engaged in the design of transition metal-based OER electrocatalysts. [4,5] Particularly NiFe-based materials have attracted extensive attentions due to their high OER activity and low cost. [6,7] By virtue of a unique layered structure and excellent stability, NiFe layered double hydroxides (LDHs) are perceived as one of the most promising OER electrocatalysts in alkaline environments. [6,8,9] The strategies towards the improvement of conductivity of NiFe LDHs to boost their electrocatalytic activity can be divided into 1) hybridization with carbon materials.[8,10,11] and 2) adjustment of LDH micro/nanostructures.[12,13] The former focuses on the introduction of conductive carbon to facilitate electron transport, but part of the active sites on LDHs could be buried in the introduced carbon leading to a loss in catalytic activity. The latter usually involves peeling-off of large pieces of NiFe-LDHs into singlelayer nanosheets to expose more active sites, though the preparation process is both time-consuming and resourceintensive.

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) composed of metal ions in coordination with organic units have been investigated intensively in the field of catalysis in recent years because of their ordered structures and unrivalled degree of tunability. For electrocatalysis, MOFs are used as precursors for the synthesis of carbide, sulfide, sulfide, phosphide, and selenide nanomaterials. A few reports demonstrate that MOFs without cumbersome post-processing steps can retain their ordered structures and function as active electrocatalysts.

Ferrocene (Fc) is a representative transition-metal complex that displays a sandwich structure. [22] It possesses excellent chemical stability as well as remarkable redox and magnetic properties owing to the aromaticity of two cyclopentadienyl rings. [23,24] These unique properties greatly broaden the applications of ferrocene, ranging from charge storage [25,26] to communication devices [25,27] and catalysis. [28] Benniston and co-workers have reported that connecting the electron-rich and bulky ferrocene group with metalloporphyrin can significantly enhance the overall hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). [29] Budnikova and co-workers demonstrate that MOF synthesized using ferrocene diphosphonate and 4,4′-bipyridine ligand exhibits excellent HER performance. [30] However, ferrocene-containing MOFs have not been investigated for OER yet.

Herein, for the first time, we demonstrate the utility of 2D MOF nanosheets synthesized using ferrocene dicarboxylic acids as organic ligands coordinated with nickel salts on a Ni foam (NF) for OER (hereafter referred as NiFc-MOF/NF). NiFc-MOF/NF exhibits excellent OER performance with an

overpotential of 195 and 241 mV at 10 and 100 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, respectively under alkaline conditions. Experiment and spin-polarization density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that 1) the ferrocene units confined within NiFc-MOF serve as electron transfer mediators, and 2) the unique electronic 2D structure promotes the contact between the nickel active sites and hydroxide radical intermediates.

NiFc-MOF was prepared on NF by a solvothermal method using nickel chloride hexahydrate and 1,1'-ferrocenedicarboxylic acid as precursors as schematically illustrated in Figure 1. The detailed synthetic process can be found in the Supporting Information (Figure S1; Table S1).

Figure 1. Illustration of the synthesis of NiFc-MOF on Ni foam.

The morphology of NiFc-MOF was characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) as shown in Figure 2. The dense and uniform nanosheets with an average lateral size of about 600 nm are vertically grown on the foamed nickel skeleton (Figure 2a, b). The TEM image (Figure 2c) together with atomic force microscopy (AFM) image (Supporting Information, Figure S2) further supports the 2D morphology of nanosheets with an average thickness of 30 nm. The 2D

nanosheet morphology with vertical orientation not only can provide large quantity of active sites but also facilitate the removal of large bubbles during the OER process, which is in favor of high electrocatalytic performance. The energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) results confirm matching uniform distributions of O, Fe, Ni elements within the NiFc-MOF nanosheets (Figure 2 d), and an atomic ratio of 1:1 for Ni:Fe in the NiFc-MOF, which coincides with inductively coupled plasma (ICP) results (Supporting Information, Table S2).

X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of NiFc-MOF are displayed in the Supporting Information, Figure S3. The NiFc-MOF crystal structure (a = 28 Å, b = 3.3 Å, c = 5.9 Å, $\alpha = \gamma = 90^{\circ}, \beta = 101^{\circ}$ ) is shown in the Supporting Information, Figure S4; the cell shape and the atomic positions were optimized by DFT calculations with PBE functional based on the previous reported ZnFc-MOF crystal structure, [31] where the Ni atom is coordinated by four oxygen atoms of the pair of carboxylate groups on each ferrocene unit. The simulated XRD pattern of NiFc-MOF agrees with experimental results from NiFc-MOF/NF and powder NiFc-MOF (Supporting Information, Figure S3). Furthermore, the chemical compositions and chemical environment of the NiFc-MOF are characterized using infrared (IR) spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The band at 1670 cm<sup>-1</sup> assigned to the C=O stretching vibration of ferrocenedicarboxylic groups completely vanished in NiFc-MOF (Supporting Information, Figure S5), which is indicative of successful coordination of Ni atoms to the carboxylic groups of the ferrocene units. A characteristic ring external mode of Fc at 324 cm<sup>-1</sup> is observed in the Supporting Information, Figure S6. The other bands assignments are listed in the Supporting Information, Tables S3,S4. The XP spectra of NiFc-MOF are shown in the Supporting Information, Figure S7. The peaks at 708.2 and 721.1 eV can be attributed to Fe<sup>2+</sup> 2p<sub>3/2</sub> and Fe<sup>2+</sup> 2p<sub>1/2</sub> of ferrocene units, respectively. [32] The peaks at 855.7  $(2p_{3/2})$  and 873.4 eV  $(2p_{1/2})$ are associated to the Ni<sup>2+</sup> coordinated with oxygen atoms of the carboxylic group of ferrocene units.

The OER performance of NiFc-MOF/NF was evaluated in a standard three-electrode system using NiFc-MOF/NF as a working electrode, a Pt wire as a counter electrode, and Hg/ HgO as a reference electrode in 1 M KOH. Prior to OER assessment, cyclic voltammetry (CV) scan was performed to activate the sample to obtain optimized OER performance of the material (Supporting Information, Figures S8-S11; Table S5). Linear scanning voltametric (LSV) results (Figure 3a) reveal that the NiFc-MOF/NF exhibits the best OER performance with an overpotential of 195 mV at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> among of the reference samples of Ni/NF (271 mV), Fc/NF (257 mV), and NiFe LDH/NF (245 mV; Supporting Information, Figures S12,S13). It is worth noting that the overpotential of NiFc-MOF/NF decreases by 50 mV at 100 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> when compared with NiFe LDH/NF. In Figure 3b, the Tafel slope of NiFc-MOF/NF gives a value of 48.5 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>, which is lower than NiFe LDH/NF (62.3  $\mathrm{mV}\,\mathrm{dec}^{-1}$ ), Fc/NF  $(62.1 \text{ mV dec}^{-1}),$ Ni/NF  $(71.2 \text{ mV dec}^{-1})$ , and NF (75.2 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>). These results indicate that NiFc-MOF/NF has the fastest reaction kinetics. With consideration of the

overpotentials and Tafel slopes acquired, the two key indicators to determine the catalytic activity of the material, the 2D NiFc-MOF exhibits superior OER performance over the majority of previous reported NiFe-based OER catalysts (Supporting Information, Table S6), which is due to 1) the substituted ferrocene groups serving as a ferry to promote electron-transfer to active Ni-sites; [33,34] 2) more exposed active Ni-sites in 2D NiFc-MOF/NF; and 3) the interface between the NiFc-MOF coordinated on NF substrate for electric conduction.[35] Electrochemical active surface area (ECSA), a key parameter to evaluate electrocatalytic performance of OER catalyst, is proportional to the double-layer capacitance  $(C_{dl})$ . We obtained the corresponding  $C_{dl}$  values by CV sweep of the electrocatalyst at varied scan rate in non-Faradaic zone (Supporting Information, Figure S14). As shown in Figure 3c, by fitting the curves  $C_{\rm dl}$  values of 0.79, 1.73, 1.87, 1.41 and 2.02 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>, are obtained for NF, Ni/NF, Fc/NF, NiFe LDH/NF and NiFc-MOF/NF, respectively. This result suggests that NiFc-MOF with unique 2D structure exposes more active sites than NiFe LDH.

To assess the stability of NiFc-MOF, the material was evaluated at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> as shown in Figure 3 d. It was found that the initial activity of NiFc-MOF/NF remained unchanged after 40 h of continuous operation, and the 2D nanosheet morphology was well remained (Supporting Information, Figure S15). By contrast, evident morphological changes are observed for the NiFe LDH/NF after 6 h OER process. (Supporting Information, Figure S16). It should be noted that partial crystalline structure of NiFc-MOF was destroyed and a new phase associated with Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> appeared (Supporting Information, Figure S17). Figure S18 displays the XP spectra of Ni, Fe, C and O within NiFc-MOF after 40 h electrocatalysis. The valence state of Ni shows virtually no change but partial ferrocene groups were converted to oxide (Fe 2p<sub>3/2</sub> 713.2 eV). Analysis of O 1s and C 1s results suggests the

existence of M-O (530.9 eV) and CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup> (289.4 eV), which is in accordance with XRD results. It is noteworthy that the existence of NiO cannot be excluded, which is likely to be introduced soon during the OER process and the NiO serves as a catalytic site involving lattice oxygen. We speculate that the change of partial crystal structure of MOF has trivial influence on its overall OER performance since the majority of active sites remain intact because of the unchanged 2D nanosheet morphology.

To examine the active species of NiFc-MOF/NF contributing to OER performance in situ electrochemical Raman spectroscopy was conducted to (Supporting Information, Figure S19). The Raman spectra acquired at potentials below about 1.3 V vs. RHE exhibit two weak bands at 442 cm<sup>-1</sup> and 504 cm<sup>-1</sup>, which are assigned to the A<sub>1g</sub> stretching modes of Ni<sup>II</sup>-OH and Ni<sup>II</sup>-O, respectively, in Ni<sup>II</sup>O(OH).<sup>[36]</sup> At potentials higher than 1.4 V vs. RHE, two well-defined bands appear at 474 cm<sup>-1</sup> and 553 cm<sup>-1</sup>, which can be attributed to the e<sub>g</sub> bending vibration and the A<sub>1g</sub> stretching vibration modes, respectively, of Ni<sup>III</sup>-O in Ni<sup>III</sup>O(OH).<sup>[37,38]</sup> A broad band (830–1200 cm<sup>-1</sup>) associated to active oxygen in the oxyhydroxide structure is observed at 1.5 V vs. RHE. These results indicate that the oxidation of Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> occurs via a hydroxide-mediated deprotonation process.

To gain insight into the OER mechanism of NiFc-MOF and NiFe LDH, DFT calculations were performed (Supporting Information, Figure S20; see also details of computational methods therein). The calculated density of states (DOS) shown in Figure 4a indicate that NiFe LDH possesses a semiconductor-like electronic structure due to the absence of electron density around Fermi level ( $E_{\rm F}$ ). Conversely, NiFc-MOF exhibits a conductor-like electronic structure with

Figure 4. a) Calculated density of states (DOS) for NiFc-MOF and NiFe LDH; b) partial density of states (PDOS) for NiFc-MOF. c) The calculated free energy diagrams of OER process for NiFc-MOF and NiFe LDH

obvious electronic density around  $E_{\rm F}$  Encouraged by theoretical results we have carried out conductive atomic force microscopic experiments to probe electric conductivity of NiFc-MOF. The recorded I-V curves (Supporting Information, Figure S21) demonstrate that NiFc-MOF possesses a higher electric conductivity than that of NiFe-LDH owing to introduction of ferrocene units. Thus, the NiFc-MOF requires less energy to move charge carriers within the crystal lattice and conduct electric current.

Subsequently, as shown in the Supporting Information, Figure S3, the (200) plane is the most exposed surfaces of NiFc-MOF. Therefore, the (200) surface structure was constructed to expose surface Ni as catalytic active sites for OER reaction. The atomic positions of the (200) surface was optimized by DFT calculation to achieve a stable structure. The calculated partial density of states (PDOS) of (200) surface structure (Supporting Information, Figure S4(c)) and bulk structure of NiFc-MOF (Supporting Information, Figure S4(a)) show that the total DOS of the NiFc-MOF mainly derived from the Ni 3d, Fe 3d and O 2p orbitals (Figure 4b; Supporting Information, Figure S22). A larger Ni-O overlap area than Fe-O suggests stronger interactions between Ni and its nearest O atoms, which agrees well with the electrochemical Raman results that Ni species are involved in the OER process.

A four-step OER mechanism in alkaline conditions<sup>[39]</sup> was proposed including \* (\* represents the active sites on the catalyst surface), \*OH, \*O and \*OOH surface species (see the Supporting Information, Figure S23 for NiFc-MOF and Figure S24 for NiFe LDH). The calculated free energy of each OER step occurring on Ni sites at corresponding structure is listed in the Supporting Information, Table S7. The calculated free energy diagrams of OER process at 1.23 V vs. RHE following the proposed mechanism are displayed in Figure 4c. According to the calculation, the deprotonation of OH\* to O\* on Ni site has the largest energy barrier to overcome both for NiFc-MOF and NiFe LDH. This step can be considered as the rate-determining step with an overpotential of 0.52 eV (NiFc-MOF) and 0.81 eV (NiFe LDH), respectively. The calculation result establishes that NiFc-MOF facilitates OER via an activation barrier lower than that of NiFe LDH, thereby supporting the experimental observation that the introduction of Fc leads to improved OER performance of Ni active sites.

In conclusion, NiFc-MOF with a unique lattice structure was synthesized successfully via a solvothermal method. The NiFc-MOF shows an overpotential of 195 mV at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> and OER stability up to 40 h without significant morphological changes. DFT calculations show that the electron-rich group ferrocene facilitates the electron transport and reduce the free energy of adsorbed intermediates during the OER electrocatalysis process. In addition, abundant active sites are exposed on the unique 2D sandwich structure. These synergistic features lead to the high intrinsic OER activity of NiFc-MOF. This work highlights and strengthens the importance of designing suitable MOF structures that promote the development of high-efficiency OER catalysts.

Ferrocene-Based Metal-Organic Framework Nanosheets as a Robust Oxygen Evolution Catalyst

2D MOFs on nickel foam (NF) were assembled. NiFc-MOF/NF exhibits superior OER performance (overpotential of 195 mV at 10 and 241 mV at 100 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>) under alkaline conditions. The ferrocene units within the MOF crystalline structure enhance the overall electron transfer capacity, thereby leading to a theoretical overpotential of 0.52 eV (lower than NiFe double hydroxides: 0.81 eV).

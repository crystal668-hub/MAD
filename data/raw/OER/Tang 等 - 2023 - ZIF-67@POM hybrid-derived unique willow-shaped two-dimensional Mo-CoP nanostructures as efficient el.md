Designing highly efficient non-precious metal electrocatalysts to facilitate overall water decomposition is critical and highly desirable, but still challenging. In this study, we synthesized ZIF-67@POM nanomaterials by doping  $H_3PMo_{12}O_{40}$  in ZIF-67. The molybdenum-doped carbon matrix can effectively reduce CoP agglomeration, which is conducive to improving the specific surface area and active sites of the catalyst. The doping of Mo also optimizes the electronic structure of Mo-CoP-100 and improves its electrocatalytic activity. Compared with CoP derived from pristine ZIF-67, the optimal Mo-CoP-100 exhibits significantly enhanced oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalytic activity with an almost constant overpotential of 290 mV to maintain a stable current density of 10 mA  $cm^{-2}$  in alkaline media for at least 100 h. Furthermore, compared with traditional precious metal-free OER electrocatalysts, the Mo-CoP catalysts prepared in this work have high specific surface area, rich surface-active sites, good cycling stability and high diffusion efficiency.

### Introduction

Hydrogen energy is a clean energy source for research because of its high calorific value of combustion, clean and nonpolluting nature, multiple forms of utilization, energy storage and safety.1 Therefore, the search for energy conversion systems and renewable energy storage is an important issue.<sup>2,3</sup> Electrocatalytic water splitting is considered the main and simplest method for scalable hydrogen production, but the target efficiency is still mainly limited by the performance of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER).4 The electrochemical evolution of oxygen in water is one of the most complex chemical reactions, which exhibits unusually slow kinetics while inducing structural changes in electrode materials, leading to performance degradation. Many noble metals have been used as electrocatalysts, such as the complexes of Ru, Pt and Ir, Ag, Au, and Pd. But the disadvantage of noble metal composites is the scarcity of noble metal sources, which limits the development of noble metal composites.<sup>5-7</sup> Many efforts have been

made to explore noble metal-free and earth-rich compounds as electrocatalysts for the OER. The highly active and stable OER electrocatalysts for practical applications have to be developed to reduce the overpotential in the reaction process. Although much progress has been made, further improvements in synthetic routes and structural optimization are needed to develop highly active and stable OER electrocatalysts with practical applications.8-11

The Keggin-type polyoxometalate (POM) is a unique cluster of metal oxides. In general, POMs contain three or more transition metal oxygen ions that share oxygen atoms and form a closed three-dimensional framework. 12-14 Due to their proton and electron reservoir capabilities allowing electron and proton burst transport, POMs are ideal catalysts for oxidation and reduction processes. As an electrocatalyst, POMs have wide application prospects in multifunctional materials due to their catalytic performance and high polarity of the oxygen-rich surface. 15-18 Despite the significant development of water oxidation catalysts in the POM field, the catalysts for synthesis from POM have not received enough attention because most of them do not have a sufficient number of active sites or exhibit a stable association between the soluble POM groups and electrodes. 19-21

The zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-67) is one of the most studied cobalt-based organic skeletons, which has the advantages of high content, uniform distribution of metal

centers, large specific surface area, controllable porosity and high adjustability.22 Due to its remarkable characteristics, ZIF-67 has been developed for hydrogen storage, gas capture and storage, and catalysis. 23,24 Over the past few years, studies on the potential of ZIF-67@POM as a catalyst for water oxidation have been reported.25 Li et al. successfully prepared a ZIF-67@POM hybrid and the material showed superior OER performance due to the synergistic egg yolk/shell structure between POM and ZIF-67. There is an urgent need for the design of highly active water oxidation catalysts, and the intelligent combination of stable ZIF-67 with a good conductive molecular catalyst (POM) is promising. 26-28 For example, ZIF-8 and ZIF-67 and their derivatives can be carbonized, modified to form catalysts, or coated with other molecules for the preparation of many photocatalysts and electrocatalysts. Wang et al. successfully prepared hollow POM@MOF hybrid-derived porous Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/CoMoO<sub>4</sub> nanocages for enhanced electrocatalytic water oxidation.<sup>29</sup> In general, it is the nanoclusters or nanoparticles that always exhibit catalytic activity, so catalytic activity can be enhanced by doping the compounds with nanoparticles.<sup>28,30</sup> In recent years, POM@MOF composites have attracted more and more attention due to their advantages, such as uniform distribution of POM clusters in a three-dimensional (3D) MOF matrix. 14,31 They can provide not only a regular arrangement of organic linkers but also W and Mo sources to generate W- or Mo-based electrochemically active catalysts. The generated composites are mainly transition metal carbide or oxide particles, which exhibit significantly improved electrocatalytic performance for the OER.<sup>32</sup>

In this work, a novel Mo-CoP-100 was introduced as a sustainable heterogeneous efficient electrocatalyst for the OER. The doping of Mo was carried out by the precipitation method, and then the sample was calcined to finally synthesize the hybrid product. More importantly, the doping of Mo shaped the POM@ZIF-67 mixture with its unique structure. In the subsequent hybrid calcination, porous ZIF-67 was used as the precursor to obtain the ideal skeleton, and Mo was used as the composition regulator. The doping of Mo gave the obtained Mo-CoP nanomaterials significantly higher OER activity in alkaline media than the original ZIF-67 derived CoP. In addition, the Mo-CoP-100 hybrids exhibited good electrochemical catalytic activity during the OER process, with a Tafel slope of 96.4 mV dec<sup>-1</sup> and an overpotential of 290 mV at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, with the ability to maintain long-term electrochemical stability.

## **Experimental section**

#### Materials and apparatus

In this experiment, cobalt(II) nitrate hexahydrate (Co(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>. 6H<sub>2</sub>O) was purchased from Beijing InnoChem Science & Technology Co., Ltd. Phosphomolybdic acid was purchased from Adamas. Sodium hypophosphite monohydrate was purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Nafion was purchased from AlfaAesar. 2-Methylimidazole (C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>6</sub>N<sub>2</sub>) and potassium hydroxide (KOH) were purchased from Aladdin. Methanol

(CH<sub>3</sub>OH) and absolute ethanol (CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>OH) were purchased from Tianjin Zhiyuan Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.

The morphology and structure of the samples were characterized on a Hitachi S4800 scanning electron microscope (SEM). Transmission electron microscope (TEM) and highresolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) images were taken on an FEI Tecnai G2 F20 field emission TEM. And energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy was utilized to create energy-dispersive spectrometry (EDS). X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a Rigaku RINT-2200 X-ray diffractometer with a Cu Ka source (40 kV, 20 mA) in the range  $2\theta = 10-80^{\circ}$ . X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to study the surface chemistry of the samples by a Thermo ESCALAB 250Xi analyzer (Al K $\alpha$  radiation,  $h\nu$  = 1486.6 eV). XPS peaks were assigned using MultiPak Spectrum software and the PerkinElmer Handbook of X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy data analysis and the peak deconvolution by using Gaussian-Lorentzian curve fitting based on Shirley background correction was accomplished with OriginPro 2016 software. The Raman spectra were recorded on a laser micro-Raman spectrometer.

#### Synthesis of Mo-CoP-100

ZIF-67@POM hybrids: 0.012 g of CTAB was added in deionized water (25 mL) to form a clear solution. Co(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>·6H<sub>2</sub>O (0.772 g) was then added to the obtained solution. Phosphomolybdic acid (0.100 g) was rapidly added in deionized water (10 mL). The above two solutions were mixed and stirred for 30 minutes. 2-Methylimidazole (1.629 g) was rapidly added in deionized water (25 mL). The two solutions were then mixed together and the mixture immediately turned purple. After 2.5 hours of agitation, the bluish-purple sediment was collected. The blue precipitates were continuously rinsed with methanol and deionized water. The precipitates were dried at 60 °C for 10 h.

Mo-CoP-100: The ZIF-67@POM powder was placed in a ceramic vessel containing 0.300 g of NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>2</sub>·H<sub>2</sub>O upstream of a horizontal tubular furnace. And subsequent calcination in nitrogen flow at 400 °C for 2 h gave rise to willow-shaped twodimensional Mo-CoP nanostructures.

#### **Electrochemical measurements**

A CHI760E electrochemical workstation (CH Instrument Inc., shanghai) was used to measure the electrocatalytic activities. All electrochemical measurements were performed with a three-electrode configuration and carried out at room temperature, using electrocatalysts as the working electrode, a carbon rod as the counter electrode, and Hg/HgO (pH = 14) as reference electrodes. All the measured potentials in this work were converted to reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) potential according to the Nernst equation ( $E_{\text{RHE}} = E_{(\nu s. \text{Hg/HgO})} + 0.098 +$  $0.059 \times pH$ ). Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was measured at a scanning rate of 2 mV s<sup>-1</sup>. The Tafel curves were plotted according to the overpotential vs.  $\log |j|$  from LSV data. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed in a frequency range from  $10^5$  to  $10^{-2}$  Hz and an amplitude of 5 mV. ECSA was calculated by the double-layer capacitance  $(C_{dl})$ , which was evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves at different scan rates in the potential ranges of 0.98 V to 1.08 V ( $\nu s$ . RHE) for the OER.

## Results and discussion

#### Structural characterization

NJC

The simple synthesis process was presented in Fig. 1. As shown in Fig. 1, ZIF-67@POM nanomaterials could be synthesized from cobalt nitrate, MeIM, and H<sub>3</sub>PMo<sub>12</sub>O<sub>40</sub>. The powders of ZIF-67@POM were placed in a ceramic boat with 0.3 g of NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>2</sub>·H<sub>2</sub>O upstream of a horizontal tube furnace. And subsequent calcination in nitrogen flow at 400 °C for 2 h gave rise to willow-shaped two-dimensional Mo-CoP nanostructures. First, the same series of ZIF-67@POM materials and asobtained Co-Mo phosphides were expressed as ZIF-67@POM-r and Mo-CoP-r, where r denotes the numerical value in milligrams of the POM amount used in the synthesis. Importantly, the ZIF-67@POM materials possess a unique willow-shaped two-dimensional nanostructure. Among the disparate material architectures, willow-shaped 2D nanostructures present evident advantages in practical applications.

POMs show a strong Brønsted acidity, which is universally considered incompatible with the acid vulnerability of ZIF-67 in solution.<sup>29</sup> An excess of MeIM can be used to effectively buffer the drastic pH changes of the solution by using a higher molar ratio of MeIM to Co<sup>2+</sup> during the synthesis, thus ensuring that ZIF-67 was successfully doped with POM. When POM has been doped in the solution of ZIF-67, supramolecular interaction between POM and ZIF-67 can change the balance of metal cations with organic ligands and affect the state of reactants, leading to further synthesis of the ZIF-67@POM hybrids. Obviously, the synthetic method is rapid, simple, effective, and reproducible, which benefits the scalable synthesis of Mo-CoP hybrids.<sup>25</sup>

Morphological characterization of the sample materials was carried out by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As shown in Fig. 2a and b, ZIF-67@POM presents a typical willow-shape with distribution around 5 µm. In addition, a magnified SEM image in Fig. 2b further demonstrates the 2D willow-shaped structure. As can be seen in Fig. 2c, the morphology of Mo-CoP-100 remains basically unchanged as a willow-shaped morphology after phosphating. Furthermore, the observation of high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) further verified the

existence of a willow-shaped 2D nanostructure in the representative materials, as shown in Fig. 2d. According to the HRTEM image in Fig. 2e, the lattice distance of the nanosheet surface is 0.2836 nm, which is different from that of pure CoP (0.2829) and corresponds to the (011) crystal surface of CoP (PDF#29-0497).<sup>33</sup> As can be seen in Fig. 2f and Fig. S1 and S2 (ESI†), the successful doping of Mo is further confirmed by the element mapping of Mo-CoP-100. As expected, Mo is well distributed in CoP and no aggregation is detected, which reveals a good doping effect of Mo in CoP. As can be seen in Fig. S3 (ESI†), the topography gradually changes with the increase of POM loading. This unique structure is likely to be associated with Ostwald's internal and external maturation mechanism, which is attributed to the coordinated reaction of POM and the acid etching of POM during hybridization processes.34

The X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns further illustrate the phase and crystal structure of Mo-CoP-100, which were compared with those of CoP. The presence of ZIF-67 peaks after doping Mo is consistent with the XRD patterns of ZIF-67@POM hybrids and ZIF-67, as confirmed by Fig. S4 (ESI†). The crystal structure and chemical state of the samples were further studied. As can be seen from the XRD pattern (Fig. 3a), there is a peak of CoP in Mo-CoP-100, which is slightly offset from the standard XRD peak of the CoP crystal. After the doping of Mo into CoP, the diffraction peaks of Mo-CoP-100 all shift, indicating that the introduction of Mo atoms leads to lattice expansion. 33,35 As shown in Fig. 3a, CoP peaks are clearly identified from all the different amounts of Co-Mo phosphide obtained. The elemental composition and surface valence of CoP and Mo-CoP-100 were investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The XPS survey spectra unambiguously indicated the presence of Co, Mo, and P (Fig. 3b). In the Co 2p spectra of these two products (Fig. 3c), the main peaks at 778.782/ 793.642 eV from spin-orbit signals of  $2p_{3/2}$  and  $2p_{1/2}$  orbitals are attributed to the Co species in Co-P; the other pair of main peaks at 781.98/797.91 eV, and leftside satellite peaks (Sat.) at 785.54/ 802.80 eV can be assigned to the oxidized Co species arising from fractional surface oxidation in air.36,37 The Mo 3d spectrum in Fig. 3d can be fitted into three peaks. And the peaks at 232.06 and 227.85 eV are assigned to  $Mo^{4+} 3d_{3/2}$  and  $Mo^{4+} 3d_{5/2}$  while the peaks located at 235.82 eV are Mo<sup>6+</sup> 3d<sub>3/2</sub>, respectively. The existence of Mo<sup>4+</sup> and Mo<sup>6+</sup> suggests the partial surface oxidation in the air to form MoO<sub>x</sub> species. The three split peaks at 284.80, 286.38, and 288.88 eV of the C 1s spectra (Fig. 3e) indicate the presence of C-C, C=N, and O=C-O functional groups for both CoP and Mo-CoP-100, respectively. As shown in Fig. 3f, three obvious fitted peaks at 129.28/130.23, and 129.28 eV detected in CoP corresponded to P 2p<sub>3/2</sub> and 2p<sub>1/2</sub> peaks of the P element in Co-P, and spontaneous oxidized P species in air, respectively. In addition, compared to the bare CoP, the binding energies of Co 2p in the Mo-CoP-100 catalyst exhibit a slight positive shift after Mo doping, thereby suggesting that the introduction of the Mo atoms can modulate the electronic structure of Mo-CoP-100.<sup>38</sup>

### **Electrochemical performance**

The electrocatalytic activities of the Mo-CoP-100 catalysts were measured in 1.0 M KOH solution. For comparison, pristine ZIF-67,

ZIF-67-derived CoP and commercial RuO2 were also tested under the same conditions. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) experiments were conducted to study the electrocatalytic activities of the Mo-CoP-100 hybrids at a scan rate of 2 mV s<sup>-1</sup>, as shown in Fig. 4a. As expected, the representative sample materials of Mo-CoP-100 indicate a much earlier start and a

faster current density growth than the other hybrid materials. The current density of the sample materials in all potential ranges is in accordance with the following order: Mo-CoP-100 > ZIF-67@POM > RuO<sub>2</sub> > CoP > ZIF-67. A Tafel diagram was used to explain the kinetics of the OER (Fig. 4b). The results show that Mo-CoP-100 has the lowest Tafel slope of 96.4 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>. These results are much better than other samples, which strongly demonstrates higher OER catalytic kinetics. The electrocatalytic performance of the samples of Mo-CoP-r is presented in Fig. S10a (ESI†). The amplified polarization curve also clearly shows that the catalytic performance of the Mo-CoP-r hybrids increased gradually along with the increase of the reaction milligrams of the POM amount used in the synthesis. It can also be seen that the amount of POM has an obvious effect on the electrochemical properties. These phenomena can be attributed to POM's remarkable performance in reserving protons and electrons, which creates electron and proton burst transmissions.<sup>39</sup> Remarkably, to drive a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, CoP needs a potential of 1.62 V corresponding to an overpotential of 390 mV, whereas the optimal Mo-CoP-100 requires a much smaller overpotential of 290 mV, even lower than that of the RuO2 benchmark (370 mV). The Tafel plots of the Mo-CoP-r hybrid catalysts derived from the OER curves were used to explain the reaction kinetics of the OER (Fig. S10b, ESI†). It is obvious that Mo-CoP-100 has the lowest Tafel slope of 96.4 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>. These results are far superior to the other Mo-CoP-r hybrid and even comparable with those of RuO<sub>2</sub>, which strongly certifies the higher OER catalytic kinetics. As

seen in Fig. 4c, the larger the diameter of the semicircular arc, the greater the internal resistance of the material. The resistance value represented by the semicircular arc in the impedance curve was connected with the transfer resistance of the ions. The semicircular arc radius of Mo-CoP-100 is the smallest, and the conductivity is the best. Notably, the  $R_{ct}$  of Mo-CoP-100 is much lower than those of CoP, Mo-CoP-50, and Mo-CoP-200 for the OER (Fig. S10c, ESI $\dagger$ ), respectively. Generally, a lower  $R_{\rm ct}$ value has a faster charge transfer rate, which indicates that the Mo-CoP-100 has the fastest electron transport capability and highest electrocatalytic efficiency among these electrocatalysts. The double-layer capacitance  $(C_{dl})$  varied with the changes of the electrochemical active sites. To compare the number of active sites exposed on the surface of the sample materials,  $C_{\rm dl}$ was represented by cyclic voltammograms (CV) at different scanning rates (Fig. S10d and S11, ESI†). As described in Fig. 4d and Fig. S9 (ESI†), the  $C_{\rm dl}$  of Mo-CoP-100 (52.3 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>) is slightly higher than that of ZIF-67 (6 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>), ZIF-67@POM (25.1 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>), and CoP (8 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>). And as described in Fig. S10d (ESI†), the  $C_{\rm dl}$  of Mo-CoP-100 (52.3 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>) is slightly higher than that of Mo-CoP-50 (26.2 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>) and Mo-CoP-200 (24.2 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>). The resistance value and capacitance of the electrode material could also be obtained from the electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS). Apart from the high catalytic activities of the OER, the Mo-CoP-100 catalysts also have excellent long-term durability. An imperceptible attenuation of activity was also observed between 1.1 and 1.8 V after 3000 CV cycles, which was also presented in Fig. 4e. The

**Paper** 

excellent stability of Mo-CoP-100 is further confirmed. In addition, Mo-CoP-100 catalysts could work for at least 100 h at an almost constant working potential (Fig. 4f). Mo-CoP-100 as a working electrode showed significant activity OER. In terms of stability, it is even better than recently reported transition metal phosphide materials (Table S1, ESI†). As a consequence, only slight attenuation of potential is observed, which further demonstrated its durability. In addition to the high catalytic efficiency, Mo-CoP-100 displayed remarkable stability by a flowing cell (Fig. S5, ESI†) during a 60 h test at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. In the durability test of Mo-CoP-100, the catalytic current decreased slightly, which could be attributed to the loss of catalyst on the surface of the electrode. In addition, Fig. S6 (ESI†) shows multi-current measurements obtained through the continuous potential step. When the current density is increased by 10 mV every 500 s, the current density increased at an instantaneous and stable constant speed, and there is no obvious attenuation after a 6000 s test. 40 These results reflect that the electrolyte has good durability and excellent mass transport performance for the evolution of OH ions and O2. According to the SEM image (Fig. S7, ESI†) of the Mo-CoP-100 samples after the stability test, the entire structure was basically preserved. The Raman spectrum in Fig. S8 (ESI†) proved that the oxidized Co was CoOOH. 41 These results reveal the transition from Mo-CoP to Mo-CoOOH during the OER.

The above results indicate that the POM was successfully doped into ZIF-67 during the electrochemical process. In summary, the Mo-COP-100 catalyst showed higher activity and better durability, mainly because the doping of Mo regulated the electronic structure of the catalyst. The unique structure, as a conductive medium, can accelerate charge transfer and improve phase stability. The unique Mo-CoP-100 structure also exhibits low initial potential and excellent catalytic stability. Mo-CoP-100 is a catalyst with a large specific surface area that could increase the reaction rate and increase the active sites. The Mo-CoP-100 catalyst has a fast charge transfer speed and high conductivity, which helps to reduce the oxygen evolution overpotential and thus improves the hydrogen production efficiency.

## Conclusions

In conclusion, a Mo-CoP-100 nanomaterial was successfully synthesized by a simple precipitation method. The OER activity assay confirmed that Mo-COP-100 has high electrocatalytic performance, which can be attributed to the successful doping of Mo, regulating the electronic structure of the catalyst. Due to the synergy of its structural and compositional advantages and the appropriate concentration of Mo, the Mo-CoP-100 hybrid products have long durability and excellent electrocatalytic activity. The simple preparation method of the Mo-CoP-100 catalyst and its good electrochemical activity, stability and recyclability have opened up new routes for multi-active site catalysts, and are of great significance for the rational design of advanced electrocatalysts in global clean energy production. In

addition, the combination of POM and ZIF-67 gives the MO-CoP-100 catalyst superior electrocatalytic activity and enhanced OER diffusion kinetics. This work may provide new ideas for future research into other ultra-efficient catalysts that do not contain precious metals. This study provides a direct experimental basis for improving the performance of transition metal phosphide catalysts with element doping. It provides a useful route for element doping to improve the catalytic activity of transition metal phosphides. Moreover, the transition metal phosphate doped with elements is promising to be used as a reliable electrocatalyst for practical applications of water electrolysis.

**The development of cost-effective electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR) is of great significance for hydrogen production. Herein, La and S co-doped multiphase electrocatalyst (LSFN-63) is fabricated by metal-corrosion process. FeOOH can reduce the formation energy of NiOOH, and enhance the stability of NiOOH as active sites for OER/UOR. The rich oxygen vacancies can increase the number of active sites, optimize the adsorption of intermediates, and improve electrical conductivity. Beyond, La and S co-doping can also regulate the electronic structure of FeOOH. As a result, LSFN-63 presents a low overpotential of 210/450 mV at 100/1000 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2, small Tafel slope (32 mV dec<sup>−</sup>1), and outstanding stability under 1000 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2@60 h, and can also display excellent OER activity with 180 mV at 250 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> and long-term catalytic durability at 250 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2@135 h in 30 wt% KOH under 60 °C. Moreover, LSFN-63 demonstrates remarkable UOR performance in 1 m KOH + 0.5 m urea, which just requires an ultra-small overpotential of 140 mV at 100 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2, and maintain long-term durability over 120 h. This work opens up a promising avenue for the development of high-efficiency electrocatalysts by a facile metal-corrosion strategy.**

## **1. Introduction**

Water splitting into hydrogen and oxygen via electrolysis has been hailed as a valuable technology for alleviating energy and environmental problems,[1] but oxygen evolution reaction (OER) as a half-reaction involving multiple electron transfer hinders the development of electrolytic water.[2] Urea oxidation reaction (UOR, 0.37 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode [RHE]) with smaller thermodynamic potential than OER (1.23 V vs RHE) is

a semi-reaction to treat wastewater containing urea which has also attracted extensive attention because UOR can replace OER to improve the energy efficiency for hydrogen production from the electrolysis of water.[3] However, UOR also involves a more complicated six-electron transfer process with slower kinetics.[4] Consequently, it is crucial to design new electrocatalysts to accelerate the sluggish kinetics of both reactions for efficient hydrogen production. Precious metal-based catalysts (RuO2 and IrO2 for OER; Pt and Pd for UOR) have been extensively investigated,[5] but the scarcity and single function of these catalysts limit their industrial popularization.[6] Therefore, the development of excellent non-noble-metal-based bifunctional catalysts for OER and UOR as an effective alternative for hydrogen production has attracted great attention.

Currently, transition metal (Fe, Co, Ni, etc.)-based catalysts are the ideal substitutes for noble metal catalysts due to their abundant reserves and excellent

electrocatalytic performance.[7] It has been reported that the Ni/Fe ratio affects the OER performance of electrocatalysts which is greatly improved by the pre-oxidation of Ni2<sup>+</sup> ions.[7d] Note that nanomaterials with high valence states, mainly including NiOOH and FeOOH, are highly actives for OER,[8] and Ni<sup>3</sup><sup>+</sup> is also the active sites of UOR. Thus, increasing the concentration of Ni<sup>3</sup><sup>+</sup> has a significant impact on OER and UOR activity.[9] Among these, the spinel-structured NiFe2O4 has excellent stability and conductivity and can provide indispensable surface redox active sites for the adsorption/desorption of intermediates.[10] However, pure NiFe2O4 has significantly less catalytic activity than noble metal-based catalysts.[11] Theoretical calculations show that -FeOOH can reduce the formation energy of NiOOH in NiFe LDH and enhance the stability of NiOOH.[12] Meanwhile, -FeOOH has an excellent electron capture capability which facilitates charge redistribution around Ni/Fe sites and activation of Ni atoms in NiFe LDH.[13] Beyond, -NiOOH can promote the accumulation of charge near the Fe sites of -FeOOH, thus promoting intermediate adsorption and greatly improving

the electrooxidation performance.[14] Generally, elemental doping can modulate the electronic structure of catalysts, activate surface active sites, and accelerate charge transfer. The modification of the electronic structure of NiFe LDH by lanthanum (La) doping leads to the dominance of high-valence Fe in La-NiFe LDH, reduces the Gibbs free energy of the reaction and enhances the electrocatalytic performance.[15] Sulfur (S) doping can fully activate the redox reaction of iron and lattice oxygen in FeOOH, resulting in a significant increase inintrinsic OER activity.[16] Moreover, oxygen vacancies are beneficial for increasing the number of active centers, reducing the adsorption/desorption energy of the intermediates, and optimizing the conductivity.[17]

Herein, La and S co-doped nickel-iron-based multiphase catalyst (LSFN-63) was successfully fabricated by a facile strategy as metal corrosion. FeOOH induced by La and S co-doping can optimize the formation of NiOOH as active sites for OER and UOR, and enhance its stability, while more oxygen vacancies can further increase the number of active sites, optimize the adsorption of intermediates, and improve the electrical conductivity. As a result, LSFN-63 presents a low overpotential of 210/450 mV at 100/1000 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2, small Tafel slope (32 mV dec<sup>−</sup>1), outstanding stability under 1000 mA cm<sup>−</sup>2@60 h for OER in 1 m KOH, and 250 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> @135 h under 30 wt% KOH at 60 °C. LSFN-63 also demonstrates remarkable UOR electrocatalytic activity and stability with a current density of 100 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> at 1.37 V.

# **2. Results and Discussion**

## **2.1. Material Synthesis and Characterization**

LSFN-63 was grown on iron foam (IF) at low temperature by the facile one-step metal corrosion process as described in **Scheme 1**a. IF was corroded by the solution composed of Fe(NO3)3, Ni(NO3)2, La(NO3)3, and Na2S2O3, where IF was used as the substrate and part of the iron source for the synthesis of LSFN-63. According to the literature,[15,16,18] it can be inferred that the synthesis mechanism of LSFN-63 (Scheme 1b) is as follows: 1) Fe3<sup>+</sup> ions can corrode IF to generate Fe<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> ions; 2) Ni<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> ions undergo a substitution reaction with iron, resulting in a nickeliron alloy on the IF surface by forming a corrosion-resistant galvanic cell, where the IF acts as an anode for the generation of Fe2<sup>+</sup> ions through oxidation reaction; 3) Fe2<sup>+</sup> ions react with O2 and H2O to form Fe(OH)3; 4) Fe3<sup>+</sup> is a strong Lewis acid and Fe(OH)3 has a high deprotonation tendency, resulting in Fe(OH)3 easily converted to -FeOOH and -FeOOH by dehydration; 5) In the presence of Fe2<sup>+</sup> and Ni<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup>, Fe2<sup>+</sup> acts as a catalyst to promote the conversion of FeOOH to NiFe2O4; 6) S2O3 <sup>2</sup><sup>−</sup> can not only serve as sulfur source to achieve sulfur doping, but also can control nucleation rate and growth rate by adsorption on the surface of crystal nucleus through sulfur-metal bond to regulate the morphology; 7) La<sup>3</sup><sup>+</sup> can be doped by replacing Fe3<sup>+</sup> in the crystal lattice of the catalyst, and the low diffusion of La<sup>3</sup><sup>+</sup> can regulate crystal growth. The morphology of as-synthesized

samples was obtained by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, **Figure 1** and Figure S2, Supporting Information). When La(NO3)3 and Na2S2O3 are added to the mixed solution, the nanosheets are observed for LSFN-63 (Figure 1a). The lanceolate is shown in the absence of La(NO3)3 or Na2S2O3 for SFN and LFN (Figure 1b,c). However, the as-prepared FN (Figure 1d) is irregularly granular when La(NO3)3 and Na2S2O3 are not employed. X-ray diffraction (XRD, **Figure 2**a) analysis unveiled that the characteristic peaks of NiFe2O4 (PDF#10-0325) are found in FN, LFN, SFN, and LSFN-63. The additional phases are formed after the addition of lanthanum nitrate or sodium thiosulfate in SFN, LFN, and LSFN-63 such as -FeOOH (PDF#29-0713). Notably, the cointroduction of lanthanum nitrate and sodium thiosulfate induce to form multiple phases as NiFe2O4, -FeOOH, and -FeOOH in LSFN-63. It is also noted that the characteristic peaks of NiFe2O4 in LFN and SFN shift to low angle than those of FN (Figure S3a, Supporting Information), indicating that La or S have successfully dope into the lattices of LFN and SFN,[15,19] respectively. Beyond, the co-doping of La and S into the lattices of NiFe2O4 and -FeOOH in LSFN-63 is also evidenced by the shift of characteristic peaks of NiFe2O4 and -FeOOH on LSFN-63 to the left in comparison to those of SFN and LFN (Figure S3b, Supporting Information). The Fe3<sup>+</sup> and O2<sup>−</sup> can be separately replaced by La3<sup>+</sup> and S<sup>2</sup><sup>−</sup> with larger ionic radii, which change the lattice parameter *a* and lead to the peak shift.[15,20] The lattice distances of NiFe2O4 (311), -FeOOH (021), and -FeOOH (031) in LSFN-63 are 0.2536, 0.2608, and 0.2500 nm (Figure 2b), respectively, which are larger than the corresponding standard lattice spacing of 0.2513 (NiFe2O4, PDF#10-0325), 0.2583 (-FeOOH, PDF#29- 0713), and 0.2470 nm (-FeOOH, PDF#08-0098), respectively, further demonstrating the successful co-doping of La and S into the lattice.[21] The uniform distribution of the Ni, Fe, La, S, and O elements in LSFN-63 can be seen from the energy-dispersive X-ray spectra (EDX) and elements mapping (Figure 2c**–**i and Figure S4, Supporting Information).

The effects of S and La co-doping on the electronic structure and valence state were explored by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The Fe 2p spectrum of FN can be divided into three-pair doublets at 710.42/723.82 eV, 712.47/725.82 eV, and 718.83/730.6 eV, which are deconvoluted to Fe2<sup>+</sup>, Fe3<sup>+</sup>, and satellite peaks (**Figure 3**a),[22] respectively. The Fe 2p peaks of LFN and SFN have a positive shift about 0.2 and 0.3 eV, respectively, compared to FN. Of note is that the Fe 2p peak of LSFN-63 is positively shifted by 0.48 eV compared with FN, suggesting that La and S co-doping is advantageous for increasing the amount of high-valence Fe and for adjusting the d-band center of Fe to optimize the adsorption of intermediates.[15,23] The peaks at 855.72 and 873.57 eV in Ni 2p spectra of LSFN-63 (Figure 3b) are attributed to Ni2<sup>+</sup> 2p3/2 and Ni<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> 2p1/2, respectively. The remaining peaks at 861.75/878.94 and 852 eV are attributed to the satellite peak and La<sup>3</sup><sup>+</sup> 3d3/2. [23,24] The negligible difference between the characteristic peaks of Ni 2p in FN, LFN, SFN, and LSFN-63 indicates that La and S co-doping has no effect on the oxidation state of Ni.[25] In La 3d XPS spectra of LSFN-63 (Figure 3c), the peak

at 835 eV is assigned to the La<sup>3+</sup> 3d<sub>5/2</sub> of La-O bond, indicating successful doping of La<sup>3+</sup>. [26] Figure 3d shows the S 2p XPS spectrum of LSFN-63, which contains three peaks centered at 161.77 and 164.27 eV for  $S^{2-}$   $2p_{3/2}$  and  $2p_{1/2}$ , and 168.97 eV for the sulfate group.[16]

#### 2.2. Electrocatalytic OER Under Alkaline Water

#### 2.2.1. Electrocatalytic OER Performance

To evaluate the OER performance, the electrocatalytic properties of the samples in 1 m KOH solution were investigated using cyclic and linear voltammetry in a standard three-electrode system (Figure 4a and Figure S5a, Supporting Information). The significant redox peak at about 1.35 V versus RHE in the CV of LSFN-63 is related to the Ni<sup>2+</sup>/Ni<sup>3+</sup> redox process because the redox reaction is carried out in the positive potential sweep interval.<sup>[27]</sup> Meanwhile, the peak in the CV of LSFN-63 at 1.25 V versus RHE originated from the negative scanning is due to the reduction of Ni<sup>3+</sup> to Ni<sup>2+</sup>. [28] According to Figure 4a,b and Figure S5a and Table S1, Supporting Information, the overpotential of LSFN-63 at the current density of 100 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> is only 210 mV, which is obviously lower than those of SFN (285 mV), LFN (290 mV), FN (304 mV), IrO<sub>2</sub> (360 mV), and the similar reported catalysts. Beyond, the OER activity of LSFN-63 is significantly improved at 30% KOH and 60 °C, which suggests the po-

tential applications for industrial electrolytic water. The results suggest that La and S co-doping can modulate the electronic structure of FeOOH, optimize the Gibbs free energy of the reaction, and thus improve the OER performance. [15,16] The activity of LSFN-63 is also superior to those of LSFN-09, LSFN-27, LSFN-81, and LSFN-90 (Figure S5b, Supporting Information), which has an overpotential of 450 mV at a current density of 1000 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> under 1 м KOH solution at room temperature (Figure S5c, Supporting Information). The Tafel slope is an indispensable parameter for exploring the dynamical mechanism. In Figure 4c, LSFN-63 shows the lowest Tafel slop (32 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>) compared to those of SFN (36 mV  $dec^{-1}$ ), LFN (37 mV  $dec^{-1}$ ), and FN (39 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>), indicating that the kinetics of OER can be optimized by La and S co-doping. [22a] In Figure 4d and Figure S6, Supporting Information, the double layer capacitance  $(C_{al})$  value of LSFN-63 is 7 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>, which is 1.2, 1.9, and 2.0 times more than those of SFN, LFN, and FN, respectively. The ECSA of LSFN-63 (Figure S7a, Supporting Information) is ≈175 cm<sup>2</sup>, significantly higher than SFN (145 cm<sup>2</sup>), LFN (93 cm<sup>2</sup>), and FN (88 cm<sup>2</sup>), indicating the more accessible active sites after La and S co-doping. The normalized current densities based on ECSA in Figure S7b, Supporting Information, also confirm that the LSFN-63 has the best intrinsic catalytic activity.<sup>[29]</sup>

Stability is an important parameter to measure the performance of a catalyst. To evaluate the stability of LSFN-63, we performed durability tests on LSFN-63 under different conditions. In 1 м KOH solution at room temperature, LSFN-63 can

maintain its catalytic performance at the current density of 1000 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> for 60 h without decay (Figure 4e). Beyond, LSFN-63 can also keep high catalytic activity for 135 h at the current density of 250 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> under 30% KOH solution at 60 °C with ignorable attenuation, demonstrating robust electrocatalytic stability under industrial electrolytic water.

## *2.2.2. The Origin of Excellent Performance on LSFN-63*

The activation energy (*E*a) is obtained by the relationship between **log** *j* and **1/T** (Figures S8 and S9, Supporting Information). The *E*<sup>a</sup> value of LSFN-63 is lower than those of SFN, LFN, and FN (Figure 4f), indicating that the synergies derived from La and S co-doping can improve the catalytic performance by optimizing the activation process of the reaction intermediates. Furthermore, the reaction mechanism can be further elucidated by CV curves (Figure S10, Supporting Information) measured at various scanning rates based on the following equation[30]

$$i_{\rm p} = a v^b \tag{1}$$

where *i*<sup>p</sup> is the cathodic peak current density, is the scan rate, and the value of *b* is the slope of **log** *i***<sup>p</sup>** against **log** curve. A value of *b* close to 0.5 indicates that the reaction is controlled by diffusion. However, a value of *b* around 1 suggests that the reaction is affected by the capacitive behavior. In Figure 4g, the values of *b* of LSFN-63, SFN, LFN, and FN are determined to be 0.61, 0.58, 0.26, and 0.28, respectively, suggesting that diffusion has an impact on the electrochemical process, which is due to the concentration polarization effect of electrolytes or the mass transport limitation caused by the excellent surface electrocatalytic reaction.

We further shed light on the redox mechanism of the catalysts by investigating the Nernst potential shift of the LSV curves under different pH values to elucidate their roles in enhancing OER performance (Figure S11, Supporting Information). By plotting the potential at a current density of 1 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> against pH (this current density is chosen to reduce the interference of Tafel slope), the potential shifts of LSFN-63 and SFN are 57 and 54 mV/pH, respectively, which are close to the theoretical value of 59.1 mV/pH for 1e<sup>−</sup>/1OH<sup>−</sup> coupled redox process (Figure 4h). This results can be attributed to the rate-limited lattice O-driven O─O coupling,[16] while the potential shifts of LFN and FN are 84 and 88 mV/pH, respectively, which are close to the potential shift

of ≈90 mV/pH that involves a total of 3OH<sup>−</sup> and 2e<sup>−</sup> transfer. According to the previous literature, the potential shift is mainly caused by the attack of the solution phase OH<sup>−</sup> during the reaction control step.[31] The 3OH<sup>−</sup>/2e<sup>−</sup> transfer process requires a higher overpotential than the 1e<sup>−</sup>/1OH<sup>−</sup> coupled redox process to trigger the OER process.[16] Thus, S doping can optimize the OER process to improve the catalytic performance, and S and La co-doping can still be advantageous for promoting the optimization of the electrocatalytic process and enhancing the electrocatalytic activity.

Operando electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used to further investigate the interfacial reaction in OER process and to evaluate the charge-transfer properties of the catalyst. The corresponding equivalent circuit model (Q(QR)(QR)) is used to analyze the data (Figure S12, Supporting Information), where Rs is the solution resistance, *R*<sup>1</sup> represents the charge transfer resistance, and *R*<sup>2</sup> is associated with the adsorption of intermediate (OH<sup>−</sup>) on the catalyst surface.[22a,32] As shown in **Figure 5**a–d, the Bode plots show two obvious peaks, where **region I** is attributed to the adsorption of the intermediates at the interface, and **region II** is related to charge transfer.[32] The phase angle in the **region I** decrease with increasing

voltage, which is attributed to the increase of the adsorbed intermediates at the active site with increasing potential.[33] In Figure 5e–h and Figure S13, Supporting Information, the *R*<sup>1</sup> and *R*<sup>2</sup> values of LSFN-63 are lower than those of SFN, LFN, and FN, confirming that La and S co-doping is beneficial for enhancing charge transfer and optimizing the adsorption of intermediates.[34]

The XPS analysis before and after the reaction helps to shed light on the mechanism of the electrocatalytic reaction. In **Figure 6**a, the characteristic peak of Ni<sup>3</sup><sup>+</sup> is detected in Ni 2p spectra after OER, indicating that NiOOH is generated by the partial reconstruction of LSFN-63 after the electro-oxidation reaction.[35] The characteristic peaks of NiOOH are detected in Raman spectra after OER test (Figure S14a, Supporting Information), which

further proves that the reconstruction of LSFN-63 after the reaction generates a new active component.[36] In addition, the morphology of LSFN-63 (Figure S14b, Supporting Information) has no obvious change after OER. Figure 6b–d displays that the valence states of Fe, La, and S do not change significantly after OER. The O 1s spectrum of LSFN-63 before and after OER (Figure 6e) exhibit three peaks at ≈529.88, ≈531.2, and ≈532.7 eV, which are due to metal–oxygen bonds (*O*M-O), oxygen vacancies (*O*v), and the hydroxyl group of the adsorbed water molecule (*O*a),[5,37] respectively. The area ratio of *O*v/(*O*<sup>v</sup> + *O*M-O) after OER test of LSFN-63 is 67%, which is higher than that before the OER test (60%), indicating that the surface reconstruction during OER process is conducive to the generation of more oxygen defects. The electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) (Figure 6f) signal intensity (*g* ≈ 2.004) of LSFN-63 after OER is stronger than that before OER, which further proves that partial reconstruction of LSFN-63 can improve the concentration of oxygen vacancies.[20] Numerous oxygen vacancies can increase the number of active sites, reduce the energy required for the adsorption/desorption of intermediates, and improve the charge transfer efficiency.[38]

#### **2.3. Electrocatalytic Performance toward UOR**

The UOR performance of LSFN-63 was tested in a solution of 1 m KOH + 0.5 m urea. LSFN-63 can reach a current density of 100 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> at a voltage of 1.37 V during the UOR (**Figure 7**a). The voltage required by LSFN-63 at the same current density is significantly reduced by about 70 mV compared to the OER, indicating a greater advantage in the UOR process for electrolytic hydrogen production. It is essential to confirm that LSFN-63 outperforms SFN, LFNs, and FN in terms of UOR performance (Figure 7b), suggesting that the formation of multiphase synergism induced by La and S co-doping is also conducive to enhancing the UOR performance. In addition,

**Figure 8.** a–e) XPS spectra of LSFN-63 before and after UOR testing, and f) EPR of LSFN-63 before and after UOR testing.

LSFN-63 still has superior catalytic performance compared to the previously reported UOR catalysts (Table S2, Supporting Information). The Tafel slope is an indispensable factor for illuminating the kinetics of the reaction. The Tafel slope of LSFN-63 is 35 mV dec<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> (Figure 7c), which is less than those of SFN (37 mV dec<sup>−</sup>1), LFN (44 mV dec<sup>−</sup>1), and FN (61 mV dec<sup>−</sup>1), confirming that LSFN-63 has a relatively fast reaction kinetics.[5] In Figure 7d

and Figure S15, Supporting Information, the *C*dl of LSFN-63 is 12.4 mF cm<sup>−</sup>2, which is significantly higher than those of SFN (10.9 mF cm<sup>−</sup>2), LFN (9.7 mF cm<sup>−</sup>2), and FN(10.4 mF cm<sup>−</sup>2). These results indicate that La and S co-doping can provide more active centers to enhance UOR activity. The EIS (Figure 7e) is processed using the equivalent circuit model (Q(QR)(QR)). The *R*<sup>1</sup> of LSFN-63 is the smallest (Table S3, Supporting www.advancedsciencenews.com

www.small-journal.com

Information), indicating that La and S co-doping is beneficial to optimize electrical conductivity and improve UOR activity.<sup>[5]</sup> In addition, LSFN-63 can maintain excellent UOR catalytic performance at a current density of 100 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> for 120 h without attenuation (Figure 7f).

In order to reveal the catalytic mechanism in UOR process, we detected the changes in the valence states of the elements in LSFN-63 before and after UOR by XPS. The characteristic peak of Ni<sup>3+</sup> is detected in Ni 2p spectrum after UOR (Figure 8a), indicating that the partial reconstruction of LSFN-63 results in the formation of NiOOH.[35] The Raman characteristic peak of NiOOH appears in LSFN-63 after UOR (Figure S16a, Supporting Information), which further proves that the surface reconstruction of LSFN-63 is beneficial to the formation of NiOOH as the active substance for UOR.[36] In addition, the morphology of LSFN-63 (Figure S16b, Supporting Information) has no obvious change after UOR. As shown in Figure 8b-d, the valence states of Fe, La, and S do not change significantly after UOR. The  $O_v/(O_v + O_{M,O})$ area ratio of LSFN-63 after UOR was 76% (Figure 8e), which was higher than that before UOR (60%), indicating that the partial reconstruction of LSFN-63 can generate more oxygen vacancies during the electrooxidation process. The EPR (Figure 8f) signal intensity ( $g \approx 2.004$ ) of LSFN-63 is significantly enhanced after UOR, further proving that the surface reconstruction of LSFN-63 during UOR can increase oxygen vacancies. Oxygen defects are beneficial to provide more active sites, optimizing the adsorption/desorption energy of intermediates, and enhance electrical conductivity.[17a]

### 3. Conclusions

In summary, La and S co-doping induced multiphase electrocatalyst (LSFN-63) was successfully synthesized by a facile metal corrosion method. LSFN-63 exhibits excellent OER and UOR electrocatalytic performance for the following reasons: i) FeOOH is beneficial to promote the formation of NiOOH as the active sites for OER/UOR, and improve their stability; ii) Abundant oxygen vacancies can provide more active sites, optimize the adsorption/desorption energy of intermediates, and accelerate charge transfer towards OER/UOR; iii) La and S co-doping can regulate the electronic structure of FeOOH, reduce the activation energy of the reaction, and thus enhance the OER performance. This work opens up a promising avenue for the development of highefficiency electrocatalysts by making good use of metal corrosion.

Then, 86.6 mg  $La(NO_3)_3 \cdot 6H_2O$ , 40 mg  $Na_2S_2O_3 \cdot 5H_2O$ ,  $8.08 imes mg \ Fe(NO_3)_3 imes H_2O \ (x = 0, 20, 60, 80, 90), \ and 5.82 imes (90-x) mg$ Ni(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>·6H<sub>2</sub>O were dissolved into 20 mL deionized water under ultrasonic to form a homogeneous solution A. The IF was placed in solution A to keep at 35 °C for 6 h, then dried in air at 100 °C. The resulting samples were denoted as LSFN-09 (x = 0), LSFN-27 (x = 20), LSFN-63 (x = 60), LSFN-81 (x = 80), and LSFN-90 (x = 90), respectively.

Synthesis of LFN: 484.8 mg Fe(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>·9H<sub>2</sub>O, 174.6 mg  $Ni(NO_3)_2 \cdot 6H_2O$ , and 86.6 mg  $La(NO_3)_3 \cdot 6H_2O$  were dissolved into 20 mL deionized water under ultrasonic to form a homogeneous solution B. The IF was placed in solution B to keep at 35 °C for 6 h, then dried in air at 100 °C. The resulting sample was denoted as LFN.

Synthesis of SFN: 484.8 mg  $Fe(NO_3)_3 \cdot 9H_2O$ ,  $Ni(NO_3)_2 \cdot 6H_2O$ , and 40 mg  $Na_2S_2O_3 \cdot 5H_2O$  were dissolved into 20 mL deionized water under ultrasonic to a homogeneous solution C. The IF was placed in solution C to keep at 35 °C for 6 h, then dried in air at 100 °C. The resulting sample was denoted as SFN.

Materials Characterization: The microstructure of all catalysts was observed by SEM (HITACHI SU8010) and transmission electron microscope (TEM, FEI-TALOS-F200X). The crystal structures and surface element valence of the catalysts were obtained by XRD (Rigaku D/max2500PC), Raman (LabRam HR Evolution, 532 nm), and XPS (Thermo Kalpha). The presence of oxygen defects was verified by EPR spectroscopy (Bruker EMXplus).

Electrochemical Measurements: The electrochemical properties of the catalysts were analyzed using a standard three-electrode system (CHI 660e workstation). In this system, IF containing active phase was the working electrode, carbon sheet was the counter electrode, and Hg/HgO was the reference electrode. The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) tests were performed at a scan speed of 10 mV s<sup>-1</sup>. The voltage and frequency of the EIS test were 1.3824–1.4824 V versus RHE from 0.01 to 10<sup>5</sup> Hz, respectively. Double-layer capacitance ( $C_{dl}$ ) was derived from cyclic voltammetry (CV, 1.0024-1.1024 V vs RHE, 20-120 mV s<sup>-1</sup>). Electrochemical surface area (ECSA) was obtained by the formula ECSA =  $(C_{dl}/C_0)S_c$  (where  $C_0 = 0.04$ mF cm $^{-2}$  in 1 mol L $^{-1}$  KOH and  $S_{\rm c}$  was the area of the electrocatalyst). The ohmic potential drop (IR) correction was used to reduce the effect of electrolyte resistance. The RHE was converted from Hg/HgO by the following formula (Figure S1, Supporting Information)  $E_{\text{RHE}} = E_{\text{Hg/HgO}} + 0.9024 \text{ V}.$

Fan Tang, Sijie Guo, Yonggang Sun, Xijie Lin,\* Jianhua Qiu,\* and Anmin Cao\*

Developing high-performance, low-cost, and robust electrocatalysts is of great importance to boost the efficiency of oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, based on the integrated design of chemical composition and geometric structure, Fe-doped CoO nanotubes (NTs) with high OER activity are prepared by a facile template-free approach. The construction of this tubular structure is realized via a simple wet-chemical reaction to prepare solid nanorods as precursor and a subsequent calcination treatment of the precursor to form hollow cavity. The favorable composition and unique hollow structure endow these Fe-doped CoO NTs with remarkable activity toward OER. When used as the electrocatalyst for OER, the Fe-doped CoO NTs show a small overpotential of 282 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, a low Tafel slope of 78.26 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>, and a high turnover frequency of 0.0965 s<sup>-1</sup> at the overpotential of 282 mV, which is superior to those of CoO NTs and solid CoO nanoparticles. Moreover, the Fe-doped CoO NTs also exhibit excellent long-term stability of 24 h at the current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>.

production of high-purity hydrogen. [3] Usually, the efficiency of electrochemical water splitting mainly depends on its two half-cell reactions, including oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). [4] In particular, OER has been identified as the rate-limiting step of electrochemical water splitting due to the sluggish reaction kinetics attributed to its complex four-electron transfer reaction, which will lead to large overpotential and low cycle efficiency. [5] Therefore, to overcome the dynamic obstacles, numerous researches have been devoted into the development of high-performance electrocatalysts for OER.

Various kinds of electrocatalysts have been developed to reduce the overpotential and increase the reaction rate of OER. Although noble metal-based oxides, such as IrO<sub>2</sub> and RuO<sub>2</sub> which are considered

as the state-of-art electrocatalysts for OER, can deliver excellent catalytic activity toward OER, the high cost and low abundance of these materials seriously limit their large-scale commercial applications. [6] In addition, these noble metal-based electrocatalysts usually suffer from poor durability. [7] Hence, it is of great importance to develop high-efficient, low-cost, and robust electrocatalysts for OER. Recently, transition metal oxides have emerged to be a series of potential electrocatalysts for OER, owing to their abundant reserves and promising activity. [8] Among various kinds of transition metal oxides, Co-based oxides, for example, Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> and CoO, are highly appealing candidates for OER due to their high catalytic activity and good long-term stability. [9] However, the further improvement of Co-based oxides in catalytic performance is hindered by their poor intrinsic activity.

Rational design of chemical composition and geometric structure of electrocatalysts has been identified as effective strategies to improve their catalytic performance. Numerous researches have confirmed that the OER activity of Co-based oxides can be remarkably improved by doping Co-based oxides with other functional elements such as Fe, Ni, and Mn.<sup>[10]</sup> The synergistic effects between Co and the introduced metals can optimize the electronic structure of the host material, leading to significant enhancement in electrical conductivity and more active sites can be exposed.<sup>[11]</sup> Except for composition control, structural design also plays a crucial role in the improvement of the catalytic performance for Co-based oxides. Hollow structure, which has been widely used in the structural design of various catalysts, is also attractive in the design of high-performance OER catalysts.

The large specific surface area of the hollow structure endows materials with abundant active sites to facilitate the multistep process in OER. Meanwhile, the hollow structure can provide a short proton-coupled electron transfer path for OER, resulting in improving the diffusion efficiency. Although numerous efforts have been devoted to the systematic optimization of the composition or structure of Co-based oxide electrocatalysts, the preparation of Co-based oxides with both desirable composition and structure usually suffers from multistep procedures and unsatisfactory controllability. Therefore, it is still challenging to develop facile synthetic protocols to achieve the precise control on the composition and structure of Co-based oxides catalysts for OER.

Herein, we reported a facile and efficient synthetic protocol for the preparation of Fe-doped CoO nanotubes (denoted as Fe-CoO NTs) as a high-performance electrocatalyst for OER. This synthetic protocol showed good controllability on the composition and structure of this Fe-CoO NT. Without using templates, hollow tubular structure could be well constructed via a simple wetchemical reaction and a subsequent calcination process. Avoiding taking any extra procedures, Fe doping was achieved by in situ introducing iron salt during the wet-chemical reaction. Characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), the synthesized sample showed a satisfying hollow tubular structure; meanwhile, Fe species were uniformly dispersed into the framework of CoO NTs without any agglomerates. Contributing to the unique hollow structure and the synergistic effect between Fe and Co, this Fe-CoO NT was demonstrated to be a high-performance electrocatalyst for OER. Only an overpotential of 282 mV was required to obtain the current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> in alkaline medium for the Fe-CoO NT, which was much smaller than that of CoO NTs (320 mV) and solid CoO nanoparticles (369 mV). In addition, a low Tafel slope (78.26 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>) of this Fe-CoO NT indicated much improvement in dynamic kinetics. Furthermore, the Fe-CoO NT also showed excellent durability for OER; the potential at a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> did not show noticeable change even after continuous test for 24 h.

#### 2. Results and Discussion

Scheme 1 displays the detailed synthetic process of the Fe-CoO NT. In the synthetic protocol, a wet-chemical reaction was taken first to prepare Fe/Co-based nanorods as the precursor. Anhydrous ethanol and urea were used as solvent and

precipitant, respectively. At first, iron salt, cobalt salt, and urea were completely dissolved in anhydrous ethanol to form a transparent mixed solution. Then, this mixed solution was heated to 80 °C and reacted at this temperature for 8 h. During the hightemperature reaction, urea slowly decomposed to release alkaline substrates such as OH-. These alkaline substrates further reacted with transition metal ions (Co<sup>2+</sup> and Fe<sup>2+</sup>) to generate Fe/Co-based precipitates as the precursor. Meanwhile, the adsorption of OH ions on the Fe/Co-based precipitates would enhance the polarity of the precursor. Therefore, the electrostatic force and hydrogen bonding induced the self-assembly of the Fe/ Co-based precursor, leading to the formation of this special nanorod morphology. [14] After following calcination of the precursor at 400 °C, organic compounds were thermal decomposed, and then the hollow structure was formed. In the meantime, due to the crystallization of the transition metal species, the composition of the precursor was transformed to CoO with Fe species dispersed uniformly into the framework, finally forming the hoped-for Fe-CoO NT. According to previous research, the formation of this NT morphology could be attributed to the crystallization of transition metal oxides, and the thermal decomposition of organic compounds simultaneously proceeded during the calcination process.<sup>[15]</sup>

The morphology evolution of the as-prepared Fe-CoO NT during the synthetic process was characterized by SEM and TEM. Figure S1, Supporting Information, shows the SEM and TEM images of the precursor collected after the wet-chemical reaction. It could be found that the precursor existed as nanorods, and it was in the state of solid. According to the X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, the composition of the precursor was cobalt acetate hydroxide (Figure S2, Supporting Information). It did not detect the signal of Fe from the XRD pattern of the precursor, which might be due to the small amount of the introduced Fe. After calcination, the sample still maintained the rodlike shape; meanwhile, hollow cavity could be observed from the fracture surface (Figure 1a). The further TEM analysis confirmed the formation of hollow tubular structure after calcination. As shown in Figure 1b, the calcinated sample was found to be in a tube-like shape, forming a typical morphology of the NT, which indicated the success of our synthetic protocol in the construction of well-designed hollow tubular structures. It did not find any agglomerates of Fe species that existed separated from the NTs, meaning that the introduced Fe species were well dispersed into the CoO framework without the generation of independent Fe-based compounds after calcinating. The high-resolution TEM

(HRTEM) image (inset in Figure 1b) showed the high-crystalline state of the calcinated sample, and the interplanar spacing of 0.247 nm, could be ascribed to the characteristic (111) planes of CoO, indicating that the composition of the precursor transformed into CoO after calcination. The corresponding lattice fringe of Fe species was difficult to find in the HRTEM image, which might be due to its low doping amount and high dispersion.

To confirm the successful introduction of Fe, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) of the calcinated sample was taken and is shown in Figure S3, Supporting Information. It was encouraging to find that all the expected signals, including Co, Fe, and O, have been detected in the as-prepared Fe-CoO NT, well verifying that the Fe element has been successfully introduced. Moreover, from the result of elemental mappings displayed in Figure 1c, the uniform dispersion of Fe into the framework of CoO NTs could be observed. No separated sinters have been found, which was in good agreement with the result of EDX and TEM, confirming the formation of Fe-CoO NTs via this synthetic protocol. The XRD pattern of the calcinated sample is shown in Figure 1d. The peaks that appeared at  $36.5^{\circ}$ ,  $42.4^{\circ}$ ,  $61.5^{\circ}$ ,  $73.7^{\circ}$ , and  $77.6^{\circ}$ could be respectively assigned to the characteristic signals of (111), (200), (220), (311), and (222) of cubic-type CoO (PDF #43-1004), which further demonstrated that the main composition of the calcinated sample was CoO. There were no signals of Fe species that were detected from the XRD analysis because the Fe species with low doping amount were highly dispersed into the CoO NTs, leading to no observable peaks. In addition, calculated by the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method, a relatively high specific surface area of  $53.29\,\mathrm{m}^2\,\mathrm{g}^{-1}$  could be provided by this as-prepared Fe–CoO NT that contributed to the desirable hollow structure. The characteristic hysteresis loop observed from the N<sub>2</sub> adsorption—desorption isotherm (**Figure 2**a) indicated the existence of the mesoporous structure in the Fe–CoO NT. The high specific surface area and the unique hollow mesoporous structure of this sample endowed it with promising potential to serve as a high-efficient catalyst.

Further X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was carried out to investigate the chemical valence of the elements in the Fe-CoO NT. Figure 3a shows the XPS survey spectrum of the Fe-CoO NT. The signals of Co, Fe, and O have been observed, indicating the successful doping of Fe, which was in good accordance with our earlier analysis. From the high-resolution XPS spectrum of Co 2p (Figure 3b), two peaks that appeared at about 780.7 and 796.7 eV could be assigned to the characteristic signals of Co  $2p_{3/2}$  and Co  $2p_{1/2}$ , respectively, and the peaks around 785.7 and 802.6 eV were the corresponding satellite peaks, which were well matched with Co<sup>2+</sup> that came from CoO. [16] The high-resolution XPS spectrum of Fe 2p shown in Figure 3c could be divided into three peaks. Peaks at 712.7 and 718.6 eV were indexed to Fe  $2p_{3/2}$  and the corresponding satellite peak, and the broad peak around 724.8 eV could be ascribed to Fe  $2p_{1/2}$ , indicating that the Fe species of Fe-doped CoO composites existed as the high oxidation state of Fe<sup>3+</sup>.[17] In the high-resolution XPS spectrum of O 1s (Figure 3d), three peaks that appeared at 530.1, 531.8, and 532.7 eV could be detected, corresponding to metal—O bonds (M—O), oxygen defects/ vacancies, and surface-adsorbed oxygen species (OH<sub>ads</sub>),

respectively.[18] The XPS analysis confirmed the successful preparation of Fe-doped CoO composite through our synthetic protocol.

Materials with a hollow tubular structure have numerous advantages such as a large specific surface area and abundant active sites, showing promising potential in the fabrication of high-efficient catalysts.[19] The desirable chemical composition and unique hollow tubular structure endowed this as-prepared Fe–CoO NT with promising potential as the electrocatalyst for OER. Here, using a typical three-electrode electrochemical system, the OER activity of Fe–CoO NT was evaluated in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte at room temperature. The as-prepared

Fe–CoO NT, graphite plate, and standard calomel electrode (SCE) were used as the working electrode, the counter electrode, and the reference electrode, respectively. The content of Fe in the Fe–CoO NT was measured to be 5.1 wt% by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES). In addition, to better investigate the compositional and structural advantages of this Fe–CoO NT on OER, the catalytic performances of CoO NTs, solid CoO nanoparticles (denoted as CoO NPs), and RuO2 were also tested for comparison. The morphology and crystal structure of the CoO NT and the CoO NP were confirmed by TEM and XRD, which are shown in Figure S4, Supporting Information. RuO2 was synthesized by following the literature procedure.[20]

To better investigate the effect of Fe doping, the specific surface area of CoO NT was also measured, and the result is displayed in Figure S5, Supporting Information. Compared with the Fe-CoO NT, the CoO NT showed a slightly smaller specific surface area of  $33.21\ m^2\ g^{-1}$ , indicating that Fe doping could bring an increase in the specific surface area.

Figure 4a shows the 100% iR-corrected linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves for these catalysts. The Fe-CoO NT displayed an OER onset potential of 1.512 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), which was lower than that of CoO NT and CoO NP. As shown in Figure 4b, it was obvious that the Fe-CoO NT only required a smaller overpotential of 282 mV to drive a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> compared with CoO NT (320 mV) and CoO NP (369 mV), which was close to that of RuO2 (273 mV). In addition, the Fe-CoO NT also exhibited more excellent OER activity than other previously reported OER catalysts with similar composition or structure, such as Fe–CoO/C nanofibers  $(362.3 \,\mathrm{mV} \,\mathrm{at} \, 10 \,\mathrm{mA} \,\mathrm{cm}^{-2})$ , Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>@CoO nanocrystals (390 mV at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>), and Fe-CoO nanoparticles (296 mV at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>).<sup>[21]</sup> Table S1, Supporting Information, shows the comparison of the OER performance of different reported transition metal-based catalysts with the Fe-CoO NT prepared by our synthetic protocol. It was encouraged to find that the as-prepared Fe-CoO NT showed promising catalytic activity toward OER among various catalysts. The superior OER activity of Fe-CoO NT might be greatly related to the favorable tubular structure and the synergistic effect between Fe and Co.

The outstanding performance of the Fe-CoO NT toward OER was further confirmed by its favorable reaction kinetics. Tafel slope has been identified as an important parameter to evaluate the dynamic kinetics for OER. Thus, the catalytic kinetics of OER for these different electrocatalysts were investigated through the Tafel slope measured by the Tafel equation. Figure 4c shows the Tafel plots derived from the LSV curves. As expected, the Tafel slope of the Fe-CoO NT was calculated to be 78.26 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>, which was much lower than that of CoO NT (94.93 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>) and CoO NP (112.35 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>), indicating that the doping of Fe element and the construction of hollow tubular structure could effectively boost the catalytic activity of Fe-CoO NT for OER. According to the value of the Tafel slope, the rate-determining steps of the Fe-CoO NT for OER might be the formation of metal-O and the adsorption of OH-[22] In addition, further electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was taken and proved the favorable charge transport behavior of the Fe-CoO NT. The Nyquist plots of these electrocatalysts are shown in Figure 4d.  $R_{ct}$  which represented the charge transfer resistance was usually used to evaluate the charge transfer kinetic of catalysts. The value of R<sub>ct</sub> was related to the diameter of the semicircle in the lowfrequency region. Obviously, the Fe-CoO NT showed the smallest semicircle among these samples, suggesting the smallest  $R_{ct}$  displayed by this catalyst. According to the fitting equivalent circuit, the  $R_{ct}$  value of the Fe–CoO NT was measured to be 9.06  $\Omega$ , which was smaller than that of the CoO NT (18.68  $\Omega$ ) and the CoO NP (63.75  $\Omega$ ), verifying the faster charge transfer process. The muchimproved dynamic kinetics could be contributed to the doping of

the Fe element together with the hollow structure, which could tune the electronic structure of the compounds and shorten the charge transfer pathway, leading to the enhancement of electrical conductivity. [18]

Furthermore, another critical parameter, the turnover frequency (TOF), was used to estimate the intrinsic activity of the catalysts. The values of TOF for these catalysts were calculated at the overpotential between 0 and 0.4 V with all the metal species assumed as the active sites. As shown in Figure 5a, the Fe-CoO NT unsurprisingly exhibited a much larger TOF value of 0.0965 s<sup>-1</sup> at the overpotential of 282 mV in comparison with that of CoO NT (0.0381  $\hat{s}^{-1}$ ) and CoO NP (0.0171  $\hat{s}^{-1}$ ), reflecting that the remarkable intrinsic OER activity of the Fe-CoO NT benefitted from the Fe doping and the hollow tubular structure. In general, the catalytic activity of a catalyst was highly related to the exposure of active sites. The electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) was identified to be an effective tool to evaluate the exposed active sites of catalysts. Using the cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves tested under different scan rates from 10 to 50 mV s<sup>-1</sup> in the non-Faradaic potential region (1.14–1.24 V vs. RHE), we calculated the electrochemical double-layer capacitance  $(C_{\rm dl})$  of these three catalysts to estimate the ECSA of these catalysts. The CV curves of the Fe-CoO NT, CoO NT, and CoO NP recorded at different scan rates are displayed in Figure S6, Supporting Information. According to the calculated results shown in Figure 5b, the Fe–CoO NT had the highest  $C_{\rm dl}$  value of 58.2 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>, which was about 2.6 times and 7.5 times more than that of CoO NT (22.8 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>) and CoO NP (7.8 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>). Accordingly, the ECSA of the Fe-CoO NT, CoO NT, and CoO NP could be calculated to be 1455, 570, and 195 cm<sup>2</sup>, respectively. The larger  $C_{\rm dl}$  and ECSA of the Fe–CoO NT meant that more active sites could be available in this catalyst, leading to superior activity of this catalyst toward OER.

This synthetic protocol showed good capability on the control of the Fe content of the Fe–CoO NT. By simply changing the addition amount of Fe source, Fe–CoO NT with different Fe contents could be well prepared. To better understand the effect of Fe doping on the OER performance, the correlation between the catalytic activity and the Fe content was explored. Figure S7, Supporting Information, shows the OER performance of three Fe–CoO NT catalysts with the Fe content of 2.3, 5.1, and 6.8 wt%, respectively. According to the result of the performance

test, the Fe doping amount played a crucial role in the OER activity of the Fe–CoO NT. Among these three catalysts, the 5.1 wt% Fe–CoO NT exhibited the best OER performance, which showed a lower overpotential at the current density of  $10\,\mathrm{mA\,cm^{-2}}$ , a smaller Tafel slope, and a lower charge transfer resistance when compared with the 2.3 wt% Fe–CoO NT and the 6.8 wt% Fe–CoO NT. It meant that the Fe content should be controlled in a suitable range to ensure the high-efficient OER activity. Although a lower (2.3 wt%) or a higher (6.8 wt%) Fe content would decrease the OER activity of the Fe–CoO NT catalyst, the Fe-doped catalysts still exhibited superior OER performance to the undoped one, indicating that such Fe doping strategy indeed made an essential contribution to improve the OER activity for the CoO NTs.

The long-term stability of catalysts is a critical indicator that needs to be taken into consideration for practical applications. The durability of this as-prepared Fe—CoO NT was further investigated by the chronopotentiometry (CP) measurement tested at a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. Figure 6a shows the CP curve of the Fe-CoO NT. Obvious potential variation did not be observed for the Fe-CoO NT after continuous testing for 24 h, demonstrating that this catalyst showed excellent electrochemical stability toward OER. Furthermore, the morphology of the Fe-CoO NT after the durability test was investigated by TEM analysis. As shown in Figure 6b, the hollow tubular structure could be maintained after the long-term test, indicating the robust structural stability of the Fe-CoO NT. Moreover, the XPS spectra of the Fe-CoO NT were collected after the stability test. The XPS survey spectrum (Figure S8a, Supporting Information) confirmed the preservation of Co, Fe, and O in the catalyst. The high-resolution XPS spectrum of Co 2p (Figure S8b, Supporting Information) still showed the characteristic peaks (780.6 and 796.4 eV) of Co<sup>2+</sup>, corresponding to CoO. [16] In addition, newly appeared peaks at 779.8 and 794.9 eV could be assigned to the signals of Co  $2p_{3/2}$  and Co  $2p_{1/2}$  derived from Co<sup>3+</sup>, which might be due to the partial oxidation of CoO to CoOOH during OER. [16,18] After the durability test, the binding energy of Fe  $2p_{2/3}$  (Figure S8c, Supporting Information) slightly shifted from 712.6 to 713.0 eV due to structural evolution, which indicates that more Fe atoms could be directly connected with the O atom. [23] Furthermore, stronger intensity of the peak at 532.8 eV could be observed from the O 1s XPS spectrum after the stability test

(Figure S8d, Supporting Information), indicating that the content of hydroxyl oxygen species in the sample increased. Previous research has reported that a surface reconstruction process usually happens for transition metal oxide OER catalysts during the electrocatalytic reaction, leading to the oxidation of transition metals and forming transition metal-based products with high valence state as the actual active species for OER.<sup>[24]</sup> According to the XPS result of Fe—CoO NT after the stability test, the valence state of Co increased due to the surface construction process, resulting in the formation of CoOOH to act as the actual active species to facilitate the OER electrolysis. In addition, the doping of Fe could also activate the surface reconstruction, consequently triggering a high-efficient OER.<sup>[25]</sup>

## 3. Conclusion

In summary, a facile synthetic protocol was developed to prepare Fe-doped CoO NTs as high-performance electrocatalysts for OER. Without using additional templates, this hollow tubular structure could be easily constructed through a simple wet-chemical reaction and subsequent calcination, and the introduced Fe species maintained high dispersion in the CoO framework. The Fe-doped CoO NTs showed excellent catalytic activity toward OER with a small overpotential of 282 mV at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, a low Tafel slope of  $78.26~\text{mV}~\text{dec}^{-1}$ , a high TOF of  $0.0965~\text{s}^{-1}$  at the potential of 282 mV, as well as robust durability of 24 h at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, which was superior to CoO NTs and solid CoO nanoparticles. The remarkable OER activity of the Fe-doped CoO NTs could be due to its unique hollow structure and the synergistic interaction between Fe and Co, which provided improved OER kinetics, more exposed active sites, fast charge transfer, and robust structural stability.

When the addition amounts of Fe(II) salt were 0.04, 0.06, and 0.08 g, the corresponding Fe contents in the Fe-doped CoO NTs were 2.3, 5.1, and 6.8 wt%, respectively.

Synthesis of CoO NTs: 0.38 g cobalt acetate tetrahydrate was dissolved in 60 mL ethanol. After stirring and dissolving, 0.81 g urea was added. The mixed solution was heated at 80  $^{\circ}$ C for 8 h. After reaction, the precipitation was washed and centrifuged several times to obtain the precursor. The precursor was calcinated at the Ar atmosphere at 400  $^{\circ}$ C for 2 h.

Synthesis of CoO Nanoparticles:  $0.38\,\mathrm{g}$  cobalt acetate tetrahydrate was dissolved in 60 mL deionized water. Then,  $3\,\mathrm{mL}$  NH $_3$ ·H $_2$ O solution was slowly added into the above solution. After stirring for  $10\,\mathrm{min}$ , the precipitation was washed and centrifuged several times to obtain the precursor. The precursor was calcinated at Ar atmosphere at  $400\,\mathrm{^{\circ}C}$  for  $2\,\mathrm{h}$ .

Synthesis of  $RuO_2$ : The  $RuO_2$  powder was synthesized by directly calcining  $RuCl_3$  in air at 400 °C for 2 h.

*Material Characterization*: XRD analysis was performed on a Rigaku D/max 2500-type instrument radiation at a scanning speed of 5° min $^{-1}$ . SEM was recorded with FEI quantum 200 FEG instrument operating at 30 kV. TEM, high-resolution TEM (HRTEM), elemental mapping, scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), and EDX were recorded with a JEM-2100F instrument operating at 200 kV. The XPS spectra were collected on an JPS-9010 electron spectrometer using 300 W Al Kα radiation. The specific surface area of the sample was measured by the BET method by measuring on a Quantachrome instrument at 277 K. Pore size distribution was obtained by the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method from the adsorption branch. ICP-AES was performed on IRIS Intrepid II XSP instrument.

Preparation of Electrodes: The catalyst ink was prepared by blending 5 mg catalyst powder with 30  $\mu$ L Nafion solution (5 wt%) and 970  $\mu$ L deionized water in an ultrasonic bath. Then, 0.5 mL of the prepared catalyst ink was pipetted onto the surface of CC (1 cm  $\times$  1 cm) to use as working electrode. The catalyst loading was measured to be 2.5 mg cm $^{-2}$ . RuO<sub>2</sub> electrode was prepared to be used for comparison (the catalyst loading amount was 1 mg cm $^{-2}$ ).

Electrocatalytic Performance Tests: All the electrocatalytic activity tests were performed on a Biologic VMP3 electrochemical work station with a standard three-electrode system in 1.0  $\,\rm M$  KOH solution. The catalysts, graphite plate, and SCE were used as working electrode, counter electrode,

and reference electrode, respectively. Before the test, the electrolyte was purged with N2 gas for 0.5 h. All tests were performed at room temperature (about 25 °C), and all test potentials were relative to the standard hydrogen electrode (RHE) based on the equation  $E_{\text{RHE}} = (E_{\text{SCE}} + 0.241 + 0.059 \times \text{pH}) \text{ V. Polarization curves were obtained}$ from LSV test carried out by sweeping the potential from 1.2 to 1.8 V versus RHE at a scan rate of 1 mV  $\rm s^{-1}$ . To obtain stable performance, the CV test was first performed with a scan rate of 10 mV s $^{-1}$ . All obtained LSV polarization curves were corrected against iR compensation. The value of Tafel slope was calculated from LSV polarization curve using the following equation:  $\eta = a + b \times \log j$ . Here,  $\eta$ , b, and j are corresponding potential, Tafel slope, and current density, respectively. The EIS measurements were performed near the open-circuit potential in the frequency range from 200 kHz to 10 mHz. The  $C_{\rm dl}$  was measured using the results from CV tests carried out at different scan rates. The CV curves were performed in the non-Faradaic regions at different scan rates of 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 mV s<sup>-1</sup>. ECSA was calculated according to the  $C_{\rm dl}$ . The ECSA was measured by the CV test performed in the non-Faradaic regions at different scan rates of 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 mV s<sup>-1</sup>. The  $C_{\rm dl}$  was obtained by plotting the  $\Delta j = (j_a - j_c)$  at the half potential of the CV measurement against the scan rate. The linear slope of the curve was  $C_{dl}$ . The ECSA could be calculated from the equation of ECSA =  $C_{dl}/C_s$ , where  $C_s$  is the specific capacitance using an average value of 0.04 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>. The TOF value was calculated using the equation  $TOF = j \times A/(4 \times n \times F)$ , where j is the current density at a specific potential, A is the geometric electrode area, F is the Faraday constant (96485.3 C  $\text{mol}^{-1}$ ), and n is the number of moles of active materials.

Stability Test: The long-term stability test of the catalyst was performed by using CP measurement at a constant current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>.

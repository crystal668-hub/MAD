Water splitting is a promising and sustainable technology that can address energy and environmental challenges by producing clean H2 without emissions of harmful pollutants. However, alkaline water oxidation is the most relevant process at the industrial level, and it faces obstacles due to unfavorable thermodynamics and high overpotential. The search for new environmentally friendly materials with high activity and low cost is a significant challenge. Herein, Mn<sub>2</sub>P<sub>4</sub>O<sub>12</sub> microspheres are synthesized from MnO<sub>2</sub> nanosheets via hydrothermal and chemical vapor deposition processes by regulating phosphorization as a new material in water-splitting catalysis. The spherical Mn<sub>2</sub>P<sub>4</sub>O<sub>12</sub> microstructures act as pre-catalysts and undergo surface reconstruction during electrochemical activation, leading to the formation of  $\beta$ -MnO<sub>2</sub> as the true active phase. Once stabilized, they exhibit outstanding catalytic performance (250 and 510 mV at 10 and 100 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> with Tafel slope as low as 40.80 mV dec-1) and stability for more than 32 h at different potentials. The in situ surface reconstruction highlighted by a multi-technique analysis ensures the catalyst's stability and results in efficient catalytic active sites for adsorbed oxygen, which enhances overall performance. This study provides insights into cyclotetraphosphate catalysis and offers a pathway for developing efficient and cost-effective materials for water electrolysis.

1. Introduction

The development of efficient electrocatalysts to produce  $H_2$  and  $O_2$  from water is the forefront of research for large-scale

hydrogen production. In the realm of water splitting, two distinct half-cell redox reactions, namely hydrogen evolution reaction (HER  $2H + 2e^- \rightarrow H_2$ ), and oxygen evolution reaction (OER  $4OH^- \rightarrow$  $O_2 + 2H_2O$ ), come into play. As one of the key half-reactions in water splitting, OER is restricted by the intrinsic low kinetics to attain the thermodynamic potential of 1.23 V for water splitting. Hence, it is vital to develop electrocatalysts with efficient and robust activity to facilitate this reaction process.[1] Currently, RuO<sub>2</sub> and IrO2 are the state-of-the-art commercially available OER electrocatalysts. Yet, the high cost and scarcity of Ru and Ir greatly impede the development of water electrolysis technology. In this scenario, it is necessary to investigate costeffective, robust noble-metal-free, and earth-abundant catalysts with high OER activity and alkaline tolerance. Consequently, numerous efforts have been dedicated to exploring water-splitting catalysts based on first-row transition metal (TM) (Ni, Fe, Co, Cu, and Mn) oxides

due to their intrinsic activity, high corrosion resistance, abundance in the earth's crust, and inexpensive nature. [2-6] Various manganese oxides, including MnO<sub>2</sub>, MnO<sub>3</sub>, MnO<sub>4</sub>, and MnOOH, have been explored as candidates for electrocatalytic

water oxidation. Their notable electrocatalytic activity can be attributed to the presence of Jahn-Teller distortion.<sup>[7]</sup> However, poor electrical conductivity, low density of active sites, and unsuitable binding strength between active centers and oxygencontaining intermediates characterizing these materials are still grand challenges to catch up with catalysts based on precious metals. Two effective strategies are often employed to enhance the electrochemical performance of catalysts: the modulation of intrinsic electronic properties and the increase of the exposed ac-

A promising array of recently developed electrocatalysts encompasses diverse transition metal oxides/hydroxides,[8-14] nitrides, [15-17] sulfides, [18-22] and phosphides. [23,24] The great performance of these systems inspires the exploration of new nonnoble metal electrocatalysts. Transition metal phosphates (TMPs) have drawn widespread attention due to their special structure and catalytic behavior.<sup>[25]</sup> They own excellent surface wettability, which favors the contact between the catalyst and electrolyte.<sup>[26]</sup> The phosphate group with a flexible coordination feature can effectively stabilize the intermediate state of the active center, thus creating a favorable condition for the effective redox reaction on the surface. [27,28] The most realistic feature in TMPs is that the phosphate groups serve as proton acceptors to accelerate the oxidation of metal species and induce a distorted local geometry of metal centers to promote water adsorption and oxidation. Therefore, in phosphate-reconstructed TMPs or P-doped oxide catalysts, an internal unreacted structure, newly formed TM-O species on the surface, or remaining P-O groups are the most promising active sites in OER electrocatalysts<sup>[2,29]</sup> The phosphatized framework within the substance and the TM-O species present on the surface serve crucial functions as conductive support and active agents, respectively.[30,31] Consequently, transition metal cyclotetraphosphates, also identified as metaphosphates of the inorganic compound denoted by M<sub>2</sub>P<sub>4</sub>O<sub>12</sub>, where M represents Ni, Mg, Cu, Co, Fe, Mn, Cd, etc., have emerged as electrocatalysts for water oxidation owing to the P-O linkage. At room temperature, M<sub>2</sub>P<sub>4</sub>O<sub>12</sub> is found mainly in the C2/c space group. The common feature of these structures is typical of layers formed by P<sub>4</sub>O<sub>12</sub>4<sup>-</sup> rings. The strong covalent bond between P and O contributes to the chemical stability of TMPs and therefore to the long-term durability of the catalysts.<sup>[32]</sup> Cyclotetraphosphates have received more attention because their abundant polar phosphate groups are beneficial to enhancing OER activity. Thus far, the efforts of researchers have vielded insightful results in the realm of cobalt metaphosphate (Co<sub>2</sub>P<sub>4</sub>O<sub>12</sub>),<sup>[32,33]</sup> iron metaphosphate  $(Fe_2P_4O_{12})$ , [34] and nickel metaphosphate  $(Ni_2P_4O_{12})$ [35,36] materials. These catalysts showcased remarkable OER efficiency and stability in alkaline conditions. Mn-based metaphosphates have not yet been tested as OER catalysts.

Herein, we report on the performance of spherical  $Mn_2P_4O_{12}$ microstructures on carbon fiber (CF) assembled from MnO<sub>2</sub> nanosheets as an active electrocatalyst for OER in an alkaline medium. We also describe the active role of P-O linkage in tackling the sluggish kinetics of OER. Benefitting from the P-O linkage and the strong in situ reconstruction, the developed catalysts deliver current densities of 10, 50, and 100 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> at overpotentials of 250, 420, and 510 mV, which fairly compare with the state-of-the-art catalysts. Additionally, the assembled electrolytic cell can steadily operate for 32 h at 1.45 and 1.55 V without appar-

ent degradation of activity. Post-reaction characterizations of the Mn<sub>2</sub>P<sub>4</sub>O<sub>12</sub> microsphere revealed the strong in situ surface reconstruction induced by P leakage to form a catalytically stable (up to 32 h) MnO<sub>2</sub> surface layer with traces of P. We have developed a highly active OER electrocatalyst through our work, presenting a new approach to constructing phosphate-based electrocatalysts. This research not only introduces an innovative avenue for fabricating such electrocatalysts but also provides a unique opportunity to gain profound insights into the cyclotetraphosphate effect and in situ surface reconstruction that occur during the OER process.

#### 2. Results and Discussion

Figure 1a illustrates the synthesis procedure of the  $Mn_2P_4O_{12}$ electrocatalysts. The initial hydrothermal growth (step 1) gives rise to MnO<sub>2</sub>/C. The space-confined CVD growth (step 2) is carried out in the 400-700 °C temperature range. The crystal structure of nonlayered Mn<sub>2</sub>P<sub>4</sub>O<sub>12</sub> (Figure 1b) exhibits monoclinic symmetry with a space group of (C2/c, a = 12.065 Å, b = 8.468 Å, $c = 10.170 \text{ Å}, \beta = 119.29^{\circ}).^{[37]}$  The absence of diffraction spots in the corresponding XRD pattern of Figure 1c and Figure S1a (Supporting Information), demonstrates the amorphous nature of the MnO<sub>2</sub>. During thermal treatment, as can be seen in Figure S1b (Supporting Information), the samples undergo crystallization, with the formation of distinct phases: Mn<sub>2</sub>P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> (PDF#29-0891) for MPO-400, Mn(P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>)<sub>2</sub> (PDF#31-0827) for MPO-500, mixed  $Mn_3(PO_4)_3$  (PDF#36-0130)/  $MnP_4O_{11}$  (PDF#51-0452) for MPO-600, and pure Mn<sub>2</sub>P<sub>4</sub>O<sub>12</sub> in MPO-700. Most of the characterizations presented in the paper refer to this specific sample. The good crystallinity of Mn<sub>2</sub>P<sub>4</sub>O<sub>12</sub> in MPO-700 is revealed by distinct peaks in the XRD pattern, which is also depicted in Figure 1c. All peaks can be allocated to those of the monoclinic phase of  $Mn_2P_4O_{12}$  (PDF # 360314): the most intense peak at the  $2\theta$ value of 13.98 represents the (-111) plane while the other major reflection at 29.05 corresponds to the (-113) plane of  $Mn_2P_4O_{12}$ . The large, broad peak at  $\approx$ 22–28  $^{\circ}$  is attributed to the carbon fiber substrate used during the synthesis. Carbon-based materials, especially graphitized carbon fibers, typically display a broad peak in this range due to the (002). The absence of impurity indicates that our synthesis procedure effectively induces phase transitions, leading to the formation of a single-phase Mn<sub>2</sub>P<sub>4</sub>O<sub>12</sub> sample at the highest temperature.

The SEM images for the MnO<sub>2</sub>/CF precursor depicted in Figure S2a (Supporting Information) reveal well-defined nanosheets (NSs) uniformly grown on the CF substrate. As illustrated in the SEM images (Figure 2a; Figure S2b-d, Supporting Information), the phosphorization process results in spherical nanoparticles on the CF substrate. The EDX analysis corresponding to SEM (Figure 2e; Figure S3a,b, Supporting Information) confirms the presence of Mn, P, and O elements and their uniform dispersion within MPO-700. The TEM image (Figure 2b) reveals a cluster of nanosized particles forming an aggregated structure with irregular morphology. Whereas the HRTEM image in Figure 2c for the MPO-700 sample shows diffraction spots at 4.6, 2.3, and 2.0 Å, corresponding to the (200), (-151), and (-442) planes of the monoclinic Mn<sub>2</sub>P<sub>4</sub>O<sub>12</sub> crystal structure. The SAED in Figure 2d (pristine material) shows diffraction spots at 2.18,

3.10, 4.04, and 2.52 Å, corresponding to (132), (-112), (-221), and (-132) crystallographic planes of the Mn2P4O12 structure, respectively. These results from both HRTEM and SAED confirm that the observed crystallographic planes match well with the PDF # 380314 of Mn2P4O12, supporting the successful synthesis of a well-crystallized phase. Additionally, the STEM-EDS in Figure 2e acquisition allows for a more detailed examination, revealing that the P/O and Mn/O atomic ratios precisely align with the expected values of 0.27 and 0.14.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was adopted to study the chemical composition and valence state of the as-synthesized materials. The XPS survey spectra confirms the existence of Mn,

O, and P elements in MPO-700 (Figure S4, Supporting Information). In the high-resolution Mn 2p spectra (Figure 3a) for the MnO<sub>2</sub> two main peaks at 642.1 and 655.0 eV with the spin-orbit splitting of 12.9 eV can be indexed to the characteristic peaks of Mn4+ of MnO2. The Mn 2p spectrum in MPO-700 is shifted to higher binding energy as compared to MnO2 (Mn 2p3/2 at 643.5 eV). This suggests an oxidation state of Mn higher than 4+, but the observed line shape is typical of Mn<sup>2+</sup>, whose Mn  $2p_{3/2}$  peak is typically located at  $\approx$ 641 eV.<sup>[38]</sup> The large energy shift (about 2.5 eV) originates from the strong P-O bonds, causing intense polarization of O<sup>2-</sup> and, therefore, Mn<sup>2+</sup>, which is coordinated with six O atoms. This apparent inconsistency in the electronic structure of Mn<sub>2</sub>P<sub>4</sub>O<sub>12</sub> can be explained by considering the properties of the closely-related transition metal cyclotetraphosphate Co<sub>2</sub>P<sub>4</sub>O<sub>12</sub>.<sup>[39]</sup> The XPS analysis of this compound shows that Co is in the 2+ oxidation state, but the energy position of the main Co  $2p_{3/2}$  peak (782 eV) is  $\approx$ 2 eV deeper than in typical Co<sup>2+</sup>-containing materials, such as CoO or Co(OH)<sub>2</sub>.<sup>[38]</sup> In fact, in the  $Mn_2P_4O_{12}$  structure, Mn is coordinated with (or encaged by) 6 O atoms (see Figure 1b) and there is no direct Mn-P bonding. As for O 1s, XPS spectra (Figure 3b) show deconvoluted subpeaks for MnO2 at BEs of 530.0 and 532.0 eV are associated with oxygen in the oxide (O-Mn-O) and for OH groups and  $H_2O$ , respectively. However, O 1s spectra for MPO-700 show a single peak at 532.8 eV associated with O in the P<sub>4</sub>O<sub>12</sub> rings. Additionally, the P 2p spectra of MPO-700 in Figure 3c show a peak at 134.9 eV, which can be attributed to P-O bonding. The P 2p spectrum of the MPO-700 sample shows close analogy to P 2p observed at 134.2 eV in Co<sub>2</sub>P<sub>4</sub>O<sub>12</sub>.<sup>[39]</sup> The absence of the P 2p peaks ≈130 eV indicates that manganese phosphide is not formed in the composite, [40] which corroborates the XRD results.

# 2.1. Electrocatalytic OER Performance in Alkaline Medium (1 M KOH)

The electrochemical study of all the samples was carried out in a conventional three-electrode system in 1 M aqueous KOH solution. LSV was utilized to characterize the overpotential of all the as-prepared catalysts. LSV polarization outcomes depicted in Figure 4a show that MPO-700 exhibits a superior catalytic OER performance with an overpotential of 250 and 510 mV to attain 10 and 100 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> current density. The pristine MnO<sub>2</sub> and MPO-600 catalysts exhibit an overpotential of 340 and 470 mV to attain 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> current density, respectively. Our optimized MPO-700 sample shows a comparable onset overpotential to IrO<sub>2</sub> (Figure S5a, Supporting Information). To further understand the OER kinetics, Tafel slopes were extracted from the polarization curves. The MPO-700 sample exhibits a Tafel slope of  $40.8 \text{ mV dec}^{-1}$ , much lower than the  $MnO_2/CF$  (62 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>) and MPO-600 (48.85 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>) catalysts (Figure 4b). The lower Tafel slope suggests faster reaction kinetics for oxygen evolution and rapid electron transfer. We have extracted the exchange current density by extrapolating the linear portion of the Tafel plot to zero overpotential, which yields 1.65 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> showing the very good intrinsic catalytic activity of the MPO-700. Meanwhile, the charge-transfer resistances were analyzed by the Nyquist plots (Figure 4c). The smaller semicircle in the electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) of the MPO-700 catalyst evidences the enhanced conductivity, whose charge-transfer resistance (Rct) is calculated to be 26.3  $\Omega$ , as compared to MnO<sub>2</sub> (35.7  $\Omega$ ), indicating enhanced kinetics and fast electron transfer. Warburg impedance (WR), which is defined as an ion diffusion for MPO-700, is also smaller (331.9  $\Omega$ ). To further evaluate the intrinsic activity of assynthesized catalysts, we measured the  $C_{\text{dl}}$  of samples in the non-Faradaic region, which is correlated with the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA). The CV curves of MPO-700 and MnO<sub>2</sub>/CF electrocatalyst are displayed in Figure S6 (Supporting Information). The C<sub>dl</sub> of MPO-700 is 4.64 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>, bigger than that of the MnO<sub>2</sub> (2.38 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>) as depicted in Figure 4d. Moreover, after normalizing the polarization curves by the ECSA, MPO-700 still exhibits better catalytic activity (Figure \$5b, Supporting Information), further portraying the intrinsically enhanced performance in OER catalysis. The enhanced catalytic activity can be attributed to the unique structural characteristics of metal pyrophosphates, which are derived from metal phosphates.

In pyrophosphates, two phosphate tetrahedra (PO4 <sup>3</sup><sup>−</sup>) share a common oxygen atom, forming a pyrophosphate unit (P2O7 <sup>4</sup><sup>−</sup>). This distinctive arrangement imparts superior electrochemical properties compared to simple phosphates, likely due to the more covalent nature of the P–O bonds. Such bonding can enhance electron mobility and increase the availability of catalytically active sites in Mn2P4O12.

Material durability is another important criterion for practical electrocatalysts. To confirm the stability of the MPO-700 sample (Figure 4e), we performed chronoamperometry (CA) at 1.45 and 1.55 V potentials for a total of 32 h (16 h at each potential). The assynthesized material demonstrates long-term stability at 1.45 V for ≈16 h, despite an initial decrease likely due to surface polishing. The enduring stability of transition metal cyclotetraphosphate can be attributed to the fact that the cyclotetraphosphates of some bivalent metals, like Mn, are naturally stable, both thermally and chemically.[\[41\]](#page-8-0) However, when subjected to a higher potential of 1.55 V, the Mn2P4O12 catalyst retains up to 65% of its current, indicating surface transformation and partial phosphorus leaching, which leads to the formation of MnO2.

Moreover, these compounds can assume adaptable structures with diverse orientations of the phosphate group within the crystal lattice. Once stabilized, the MPO-700 sample's robust structure during electrochemical measurement significantly enhances the stability of transition metal cyclotetraphosphate and, as a result, ensures the prolonged durability of catalysts. As listed in Table S1 (Supporting Information), the optimized MPO-700 catalyst is one of the best among the most active recently reported phosphate-based OER catalysts.

### **2.2. Post-OER Characterization for Surface Reconstruction Study**

To thoroughly investigate the structure and unveil the nature of active species in establishing a structure-activity relationship, the post-OER MPO-700 electrode was examined using STEM and XPS. TEM micrographs were employed to reveal the structural difference between pre- and post-OER in the MPO-700 samples. After catalysis, the TEM image depicted in Figure S7 (Supporting Information) for the MPO-700 sample at low magnification shows two different, distinct morphologies (crystalline and amorphous) that confirm the existence of two different phases. For detailed understanding, HRTEM and SAED analyses were conducted for both of these crystalline and amorphous phases to investigate and match the crystallographic characteristics of the material. The SAED diffraction spots of 3.10, 2.88, and 2.07 Å shown in **Figure 5**[a](#page-5-0) correspond to (132), (-112), and (-312) crystallographic planes of the Mn2P4O12 structure, respectively. These values match well with the standard pattern of Mn2P4O12 (PDF #38-0314), confirming the presence and structural stability of

Mn2P4O12 after electrochemical measurement. Interestingly, a new diffraction spot was detected at 4.92 Å in this SAED data, which was not present before the catalysis. A closer look at this new spot tells us that it corresponds to the (001) plane of - MnO2, suggesting the formation of -MnO2 in the vicinity of Mn2P4O12. This is in fact very clear from Figure 5b, which illustrates the high magnification TEM image depicting two distinct phases (Part I and II, marked in red). We further examined the HRTEM image taken from part I and II and presented in Figure 5c,d. Accordingly, the HRTEM image from crystalline area shows diffraction spots of 2.0, 2.3, and 3.1 Å corresponding to (006), (102), and (105) crystallographic planes of the Mn2P4O12 structure, respectively. Similarly, the HRTEM for the non-welldefined phase, depicted by the yellow arrow, shows diffraction spots of 2.2 and 0.2.5Å belong to the crystallographic planes (211) and (200), respectively, corresponding to crystallographic planes

of -MnO2 (PDF # 240735). Therefore, based on the SAED and HRTEM data, we can conclude that, following the OER process, the MPO-700 sample comprises both pyrolusite -MnO2 and Mn2P4O12 nanostructures. Post-OER XRD characterization, as shown in Figure 5e, reveals a peak ≈29.3°, corresponding to the (-113) plane of Mn2P4O12, which becomes visible after the reaction. This peak was previously obscured by the dominant graphitized carbon peak near 28°. In the post-OER sample analysis, the EDS examination, cross-referenced with the STEM micrograph (Figure 5f), aimed to characterize the two distinct structures within the system. The EDS spectra unveiled a notable concentration of manganese and were highlighted by a prominent oxygen peak. Interestingly, there was a well-defined phosphorus peak, showcasing P/O and Mn/O ratios of 0.27 and 0.21, respectively. Point 1 in Figure 5g indicates an intense P peak, while point 2 in Figure 5h reveals the absence of the P peak. Yet, the www.advancedsciencenews.com

presence of an intense O peak in both points 1 and 2 might be due to the presence of  $Mn_2P_4O_{12}$ ,  $MnO_2$ , and residual KOH on the surface after the OER. However, the absence of the P peak in point 2 is due to the focus on the newly formed  $MnO_2$  phase.

XPS was used to investigate changes in the surface composition and electronic structure of the MPO-700 sample after OER tests. The position of the Mn 2p states (Mn 2p<sub>3/2</sub> at 642.1 eV, Figure 6a) indicates that Mn is in the 4+ oxidation state. [33] The O 1s spectrum (Figure 6b) of the fresh material shows that the peak at 532.8 eV is primarily associated with surface-adsorbed oxygen species (e.g., O-H, H2O, or Mn-OH groups) or non-lattice oxygen, which are common in pristine transition metal phosphides /chalcogenides exposed to air or humidity.[42] After catalysis, the appearance of a dominant peak at 529.6 eV is characteristic of lattice oxygen (O<sup>2-</sup>) bound to a transition metal like Mn, oxide phase, further confirming the surface reconstruction. The OER test leaches P atoms from the surface and leaves residues of KOH (see the survey spectrum in Figure \$4, Supporting Information). The binding energy of 133.6 eV (Figure 6c) indicates the presence of Mn<sub>2</sub>P<sub>4</sub>O<sub>12</sub> and P signatures remain detectable even after the OER test. The intensity of the P 2p core level line is reduced as compared to the MPO-700 sample. From these spectra, we can conclude that strong surface reconstruction has occurred during OER, most of the surface of the MPO-700 sample is covered with MnO<sub>2</sub>, and the residual P atoms can give rise to dispersed Mn<sub>2</sub>P<sub>4</sub>O<sub>12</sub> on the surface, in agreement with TEM findings.

#### 3. Conclusion

In summary, we have introduced a controllable design method to synthesize  $\rm Mn_2P_4O_{12}$  microspheres starting from  $\rm MnO_2$  NS. The intrinsic electrocatalytic activity of  $\rm Mn_2P_4O_{12}$  catalysts is studied. This  $\rm Mn_2P_4O_{12}/CF$  sample exhibits superior oxygen evolution performance, characterized by a small overpotential of 250 mV at 10 mA cm  $^{-2}$  and significantly lower Tafel slope of 40.8 mV dec $^{-1}$  compared to  $\rm MnO_2/CF$  (62 mV dec $^{-1}$ ), and MPO-600 (68.2 mV dec $^{-1}$ ) catalysts. The lower Tafel slope suggests faster reaction kinetics and efficient electron transfer. Additionally, the synthesized material demonstrates exceptional durability at 1.45 and 1.55 V for 32 h, highlighting its potential as a high-performance OER electrocatalyst. The heightened electrocatalytic activity and long-term stability arise from the dual role played by the inter-

nal phosphatized  $\rm Mn_2P_4O_{12}$  structure and the surface-modified  $\beta$ -MnO $_2$  species formed in situ during OER. The incorporation of P-O bonding, as seen in metal oxyphosphides (M-O-P), significantly enhances catalytic activity for the OER compared to conventional metal oxides (M-O). Hence, phosphorus introduces additional active sites and modifies the electronic structure, ultimately enhancing OER performance. The in situ surface reconstruction that results in the final structure after OER, confirmed by XPS, XRD, SAED, and TEM (HRTEM), provides stability to materials by mitigating degradation and corrosion challenges associated with metal phosphides and ensuring long-term catalytic effectiveness.

#### 4. Experimental Section

Synthesis of MnO $_2$ /CF: The MnO $_2$  precursor nanosheets were synthesized by the hydrothermal method. In a typical experiment, 0.05 g of KMnO $_4$  was dissolved in 25 mL of de-ionized water under stirring to form a homogeneous solution. Subsequently, the solution was transferred to Teflon autoclaves. A piece of acidified CF with a size of 1 × 2 cm $^2$  was immersed in the autoclave and heated at 80 °C for 12 h to grow the MnO $_2$  film. After cooling to room temperature naturally, the CF was taken out and rinsed with ultrapure water and ethanol several times and then dried at 60 °C for further experiments.

Synthesis of Spherical  $Mn_2P_4O_{12}$  Nanostructures: The spherical  $Mn_2P_4O_{12}$  nanostructures on CF were synthesized through a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process using the as-synthesized  $MnO_2/CF$  as a precursor. This material was kept in a quartz tube, positioned at the back zone of the furnace (labeled Zone II) while P powder (0.1 g) was loaded at the front zone (Zone I). Subsequently, the front zone was kept at 600 °C and the back zone was treated to 400, 500, 600, and 700 °C (the corresponding materials will be named hereafter as MPO-400, MPO-500, MPO-600, and MPO-700), to find out the optimum growth condition for the synthesis of the desired composition. The reaction time was set for 2 h under the argon flow (50 sccm).

Material Characterization: The samples' crystalline structure and phase composition were examined using X-ray diffraction (XRD) on a TZY-XRD (D/MAX-TTRIII(CBO)) system with Cu–Kα radiation ( $\lambda$  = 1.5418 Å). The morphology and microstructure were characterized through Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) on a Hitachi S4800 field-emission scanning electron microanalyzer coupled with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). High-resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HR-TEM) and High Angle Annular Dark Field – Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (HAADF-STEM) micrographs were also recorded via Tecnai F20T TEM FEI equipped with a 200 kV Schottky emitter. The TEM was equipped with a MSC794 Gatan CCD camera, a Fischione HAADF-STEM detector, and a double-tilt sample holder. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)

measurements of the as-synthesized MnO2 NS and MPO-700 samples before and after the catalytic cycle were conducted at the VUV-Photoemission beamline of the synchrotron Elettra (Trieste, Italy) using a Scienta R-4000 electron spectrometer and photons of 750 eV.

*Electrochemical Measurements*: The electrochemical properties were measured using a Biologic electrochemical workstation instrument with techniques like cyclic voltammetry (CV), Linear scanning voltammetry (LSV), Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and chronoamperometry (CA). All the electrochemical experiments were carried out in a three-electrode set-up (Ag/AgCl-reference, Pt wire-counter, and asprepared catalysts-working electrode, electrolyte- 1.0 M KOH). Before measuring LSV, CV was performed at a scan rate of 50 mV s−<sup>1</sup> for 20 cycles to activate the surface of the catalyst. Then, LSV was carried out at a scan rate of 1 mV s<sup>−</sup>1. The electrochemical double-layer capacitance (Cdl) of various electrocatalysts was also obtained using the CV in the non-Faraday area at varied sweeping speeds spanning from 40 to 120 mV s<sup>−</sup>1. EIS was executed utilizing an amplitude of 5.0 mV over a frequency spectrum from 100 kHz to 0.01 Hz.

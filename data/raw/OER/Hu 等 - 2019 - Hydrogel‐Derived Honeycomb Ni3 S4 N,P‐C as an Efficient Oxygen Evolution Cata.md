**Abstract:** Development of high-efficiency electrocatalysts with low-cost for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is essential but remains challenging. Herein, a novel synthesis is proposed to prepare Ni3S<sup>4</sup> particles embedded in N,P-codoped honeycomb porous carbon aerogels (Ni3S4/N,P-HPC) via a hydrogel-engaged approach. Preparation of the Ni3S4/N,P-HPC begins with the sol−gel polymerization of tripolyphosphate, chitosan and guanidine polymer that contains metal-binding sites allowing for the uniform incorporation of Ni ions into the gelmatrix, dried with freeze-drying and subsequently carbonized under an inert atmosphere. This synthesis resolves the difficulties to synthesize pure Ni3S<sup>4</sup> phase that caused by instability of Ni3S<sup>4</sup> at high temperature, while affords a good control of porous structure and N,P-doping of

carbon aerogels. The synergy between the structure advantages of N, P-carbon aerogels (such as easily accessible active sites, high specific surface area and excellent electron transport) and the intrinsic electrochemical property of Ni3S<sup>4</sup> results in the outstanding OER performance of Ni3S4/N,P-HPC with overpotentials as low as 0.37 V at 10 mA cm−2 . The work outlined here offers a simple and effective method to the configuration of carbon-based electrocatalysts for renewable energy conversion.

### **1. Introduction**

Ever-increasing energy depletion of fossil fuels and the attendant environmental pollution have stimulated intensive research on developing new and alternative energy sources.[1] Water electrolysis (or water splitting) has been a promising way to renewable hydrogen energy relative to conventional stream-reforming. [2] However, the energy conversion efficiency of water splitting has been seriously restricted by the high overpotential of oxygen evolution reaction (OER, an important half-cell reaction),[3] since it involves a complex four electrons transfer. To reduce energy consumption of water splitting, it is necessary to develop highly active electrocatalysts to accelerate the kinetics of the OER.[4] To date, most efficient OER catalysts are based on precious Ru/Ir-based materials (e.g. RuO<sup>2</sup> and IrO2), [5] but their high-cost and scarcity make them not the most economically viable options. Consequently, it is desirable to develop cost-effective alternatives from earth-abundant elements with good catalytic activity and stability for the OER.

A promising class of electrocatalysts for the OER are Ni-based materials,[6] such as alloys,[7] oxides,[8] hydroxides,[9] phosphides,[10] nitrides[11] and sulfides,[12] because that Ni is in the same group with highly-active Pt in the periodic table. Therefore, the electronic and structural

parameters of Ni-based materials and their correlation with electrocatalytic properties have gathered widely interest by researchers. Especially, nickel sulfides (NiSx) have recently aroused more attention as the OER electrocatalysts owing to intrinsic metallic behavior (i.e., continuous Ni–Ni bonds). [12b-d] Unlike other Ni-based catalysts, the Ni–Ni bonding in NiS<sup>x</sup> (e.g., Ni3S2) is more covalent, which endows NiS<sup>x</sup> with possible anti-corrosion property under similar condition.[12f] A typical work of Zou et al*.*, who reported the Ni-foam supported high-index faceted Ni3S<sup>2</sup> nanosheets with excellent activity and stability for the OER, which even outperforms precious IrO*x*/C catalyst.[12b] Similarly, a Ni3S<sup>2</sup> nanorod array grown on Ni-foam prepared by Liu et al*.* exhibited an OER performance close to that of state-of-the-art RuO<sup>2</sup> catalyst.[12g] Although tremendous efforts have been devoted to develop NiSx-based OER catalysts, NiS<sup>x</sup> alone is not advanced far enough to satisfy the practical applications by virtue of insufficient conductivity and easy self-aggregation, which is why metallic nickel-foam substrates have been used to support NiS<sup>x</sup> in above discusions. Alternatively, the hybridization of NiS<sup>x</sup> with carbon materials has been deemed as a simple but effective strategy to address the conductivity issue. Compared with conventional carbon materials (e.g., graphene and carbon nanotubes), porous carbon aerogels with controlled interconnected network, large specific surface area and chemical stability are regarded to be more suitable for this purpose,[13] which not only can improve the conductivity of NiS<sup>x</sup> (facilitating electron transfer during the OER), but also can prevent the aggregation of NiS<sup>x</sup> and vastly expose catalytically active sites. Unlike familiar nickel sulfides such as NiS, NiS2, Ni3S<sup>2</sup> and Ni9S8, the Ni3S<sup>4</sup> phase has been rarely reported for the electrocatalysis,[12h] because the synthesis of Ni3S<sup>4</sup> is rather difficult owing to due to its instability at high temperature.[14] The electrochemical properties of Ni3S<sup>4</sup> are also

not completely known because of the lack of single-phase sample.

In this contribution, we developed a facile and novel strategy for the synthesis of honeycomb porous N, P-carbon aerogels supported Ni3S<sup>4</sup> particles (Ni3S4/N,P-HPC), and demonstrated the Ni3S4/N,P-HPC are an active and stable electrocatalyst for the OER. This strategy, which involves the sol−gel polymerization of tripolyphosphate (TPP), chitosan (CS) and guanidine polymer (PHMG), was shown to be an effective approach for uniformly incorporating metal ions into the gel-matrix. After the carbonization, the Ni3S4/N,P-HPC shows a honeycomb porous framework, high specific surface area, desired N, P-doping and uniformly distributed Ni3S<sup>4</sup> particles. When employed as an electrocatalyst, the developed Ni3S4/N,P-HPC exhibits excellent OER performance with a low overpotential of 0.37 V to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm‒2 , which is comparable to state-of-the-art RuO<sup>2</sup> catalyst. To the best of our knowledge, the hybridization of Ni3S<sup>4</sup> with porous carbon aerogels has been rarely reported and applied in the field of OER previously.

### **2. Results and Discussion**

The fabrication process for the Ni3S4/N,P-HPC was depicted in Figure 1. The preparation of Ni3S4/N,P-HPC begins with the sol−gel polymerization of CS, TPP and PHMG. The formation mechanism of hydrogels among CS, TPP and PHMG depends on two ways: at first the cationic CS is easy to cross-linking with polyanionic TPP via electrostatic bonding; [[15]] secondly, the PHMG also can graft onto the CS backbone by covalent bonding, resulting in the formation of a crosslinked CS–guanidine polymer with –NH–(CH2)6–NH–C=NHH3PO4– repeat unit.[16] The possible interactions among them are shown in Figure 1, which are further confirmed by infrared spectroscopy (Figure S1). By adding a soluble Ni-salt to the initial hydrogel, the Ni-

## WILEY-VCH

salt will be trapped within the hydrogel and the Ni-ions can be chelated via the functional groups of the polymer. Meanwhile, the added Ni-salts also can catalyze the polymerization or gelation process at a varying degree, in turn affecting their morphology and pore texture. To obtained the sulfide, Na<sub>2</sub>S was selected as the S-dopant. After freeze-drying and carbonization, the Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>4</sub>/N,P-HPC with well-defined honeycomb porous structure can be obtained. The freeze-drying helps to maintain the 3D porous structure, prevent pore collapse during the carbonization. For a comparison, the S-free Ni/N,P-HPC and Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>4</sub>-free N,P-HPC samples were also prepared using similar hydrogel strategy. More details of the synthesis procedure are given in the Experimental Section.

The Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>4</sub>/N,P-HPC were first characterized with X-ray diffraction (XRD), as displayed in Figure 2a. The major diffraction peaks located at 16.2°, 26.6°, 31.3°, 37.9°, 47.0°, 50.0°, and 54.7° in XRD pattern can be indexed to the diffraction from (111), (220), (311), (400), (422), (511) and (440) planes of the cubic Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>4</sub> (group: Fm-3m (227), JCPDS card no. 47-1739). The cubic Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>4</sub> phase presents a polydymite structure consisting of S<sup>2-</sup>, Ni<sup>2+</sup>, Ni<sup>3+</sup> and Ni<sup>II</sup>Ni<sup>III</sup><sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub> (Figure 2a, inset). The diffraction peak at about 24.6° can be attributed to the (0 0 2) plane of the graphitic carbon. The XRD results demonstrate that the Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>4</sub> phase was successfully merged into the carbon aerogels. The introduction of carbon aerogels could offer high electronic conductivity needed for the electrocatalysis. Figure 2b depicts the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) curve of Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>4</sub>/N,P-HPC, which was utilized to determine the content of Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>4</sub> in the Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>4</sub>/N,P-HPC. The TGA curve reveals three typical decomposition processes: the evaporation of adsorbed water, the combustion of carbon and the decomposition of Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>4</sub>. The XRD pattern (Figure S2) indicates the Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>4</sub> was oxidized to NiO completely after the TGA. Based on the

final content of NiO, the original content of Ni3S<sup>4</sup> in Ni3S4/N,P-HPC was calculated to be 66.5 %. Raman spectra (Figure 2c) confirm the strong graphitization of all the carbon aerogels (i.e., Ni3S4/N,P-HPC, Ni/N,P-HPC and N,P-HPC), as featured via intensive G-bands at about 1593 cm–1 . [17] It is widely accepted that the porosity and large specific surface are the inherent features of carbon aerogels. To verify the porous nature of obtained Ni3S4/N,P-HPC, the nitrogen adsorption/desorption experiment was performed. As indicated in Figure 2d, the isotherms exhibits a typical IV profile with a classical H3-type hysteresis loop, which is indicative of the mesoporous feature of Ni3S4/N,P-HPC. Benefit from porous characteristic, the Ni3S4/N,P-HPC reveal a high Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) specific surface area (237.1 m<sup>2</sup> g –1 ) and a large pore volume (0.38 cm<sup>3</sup> g –1 ). Derived from the N<sup>2</sup> desorption branch, the Barrett– Joyner–Halenda (BJH) pore-size curve (Figure 2d, inset) manifeststhe a relatively narrow poresize distribution of Ni3S4/N,P-HPC. Such porous structure favors the exposure of active sites and offers abundant channels for the rapid mass transfer during the electrocatalysis.

The morphology features of the obtained Ni3S4/N,P-HPC were systematically investigated via scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). From a large-area SEM image (Figure 3a-3b), the Ni3S4/N,P-HPC exhibit a highly interconnected and porous honeycomb-like architecture, which is consistent with the result of nitrogen adsorption/desorption experiment. The magnified SEM image (Figure 3c) shows that a large number of Ni3S<sup>4</sup> particles are homogenously embedded in the skeleton of porous carbon (yellow cycles). The porous structure of Ni3S4/N,P-HPC was further validated by TEM, as shown in Figure 3d. The average particle-size of Ni3S<sup>4</sup> particles is calculated to be about 22 ± 2 nm (Figure 3e). The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image (Figure 3f) shows clear lattice

fringes with d‐spacing of about 0.285 nm, which correspond to the interplanar of the (311) plane of cubic Ni3S<sup>4</sup> crystal. The element composition of Ni3S4/N,P-HPC was analyzed by energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis (Figure S3). The Ni/S molar ratio was determined to be around 0.61, which is lower than the theoretical value of 0.75 in Ni3S4, indicating possible incorporation of some S atoms in the carbon aerogels. The EDX element mappings further give clear evidence of co-existence and uniform distribution of Ni, S and C elements (Figure 3g). Moreover, the element mappings of N and P also can be detected (Figure S4), which confirms that N and P were successfully doped into carbon aerogels.

To study surface composition and valence states of Ni3S4/N,P-HPC, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses were further carried out. Full XPS spectrum of Ni3S4/N,P-HPC clearly reveals the co-presence of Ni, S, C, N and P (Figure 4a), further demonstrating the successful N, P-doping in carbon aerogels. Figure 4b displays the high-resolution Ni 2p spectrum. The Ni 2p3/2 and Ni 2p1/2 peaks near 855.7 eV and 873.3, and the associated excited state satellites near 861.3 eV and 879.6 eV, suggest the presence of different valent Ni-oxygen species (Ni<sup>0</sup> , Ni2+ and Ni3+) at the Ni3S<sup>4</sup> surface (most probably hydrated nickel oxide).[18] The existence of mixed valences can enhance the conductivity of Ni3S<sup>4</sup> via hopping of electrons between cations with low activation energy.[19] The high-resolution S 2p spectrum was shown in Figure 4c. Two main peaks at binding energies of 161.6 eV and 162.9 eV correspond to S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2, respectively, which are attributed to Ni-S bonds and S2− . It worth noting that the C-S-C bond located at 164.5 eV was also detected at S 2p spectrum, indicating the strong interaction between S and carbon aerogels. Another signal from S 2p at about 168.8 eV represents the S-O species. The existence of S−O bond was furether verified by the high-

resolution O 1s spectrum at about 531.3 eV (Figure S5). The peak at 532.5 eV likely results from the binding between oxygen and Ni. Figure 4d shows the high-resolution C 1s spectrum, in which the C−S bond was observed clearly, in line with the result of S 2p spectrum. The successfully N, P heteroatoms doping into the carbon aerogels was also evidenced by highresolution N 1s and P 1s spectra. The N 1s spectrum (Figure 4e) reveal the presence of three typical N-species at around 398.5, 400.6 and 401.9, corresponding to pyridinic-N, pyrrolic-N and graphitic-N, respectively.[20] The P 2p spectrum shown in Figure 4f is deconvoluted into two different bands of P-C bond and P-O bond. Depending on the doping configuration, the N and P doped into carbon can give rise to an N or P doping effect,[21] which would increase extra delocalized holes/electrons of carbon, resulting in an enhanced electronic conductivity.

Considering good metallic property and the limited studies of Ni3S<sup>4</sup> materials to date for the OER, we further investigated and discussed the OER properties of Ni3S4/N,P-HPC. The OER polarization curves were evaluated by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) in oxygen-saturated alkaline medium (0.1 M KOH) adopting a standard three-electrode configuration. For comparison, the OER activity of Ni3S4/N,P-HPC was benchmarked against the Ni/N,P-HPC, N,P-HPC (detailed characterizations of both samples in Figure S6 and Figure S7) and state-ofthe-art RuO2. Figure 5a shows the LSV polarization curves of all studied catalysts. Unlike other catalysts, a redox peak emerged from the LSV polarization curve of Ni3S4/N,P-HPC is likely ascribed to the redox transition of NiII/NiIII. The electrocatalytic performance in OER can be assessed with both key indicators:[22] the overpotential recorded at 10 mA cm-2 (Ej10) and the current density at a specific potential. As shown in Figure 5b, the Ni3S4/N,P-HPC deliver a overpotential of 0.37 V at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 , much lower than that of Ni/N,P-

HPC (0.48 V) and N,P-HPC (0.65 V), indicating the important synergy of Ni3S<sup>4</sup> and N,P-HPC for the OER. This Ej10 value is even comparable with that of state-of-the-art RuO<sup>2</sup> (0.36 V) and many non-precious metal electrocatalysts reported so far (Table S1). The order of catalysts in terms of current density at 1.65 V (Figure 5c) is Ni3S4/N,P-HPC (23.7 mA cm–2 ) > RuO<sup>2</sup> (14.3 mA cm–2 ) > Ni/N,P-HPC (2.9 mA cm–2 ) > N,P-HPC (1.6 mA cm–2 ), further showing the high OER activity of Ni3S4/N,P-HPC. The OER kinetics of all the catalysts were analyzed by Tafel plots evolved from LSV polarization curves. As depicted in Figure 5d, the Ni3S4/N,P-HPC reveal the smallest Tafel slope of about 96 mV dec–<sup>1</sup> , which is much better than that of Ni/N,P-HPC (109 mV dec–<sup>1</sup> ), N,P-HPC (282 mV dec–<sup>1</sup> ) and close to RuO<sup>2</sup> (96 mV dec–<sup>1</sup> ). This suggests the easier acceleration of electron transfer/migration for the Ni3S4/N,P-HPC during the OER. Besides, the Tafel slope value of Ni3S4/N,P-HPC close to 120 mV dec–<sup>1</sup> suggests that the first discharge step controls the reaction kinetics of OER (i.e. the formation of the OHads intermediate).[23] Despite the fact that pure N,P-HPC have relatively poor OER activity, their contributions to the improved OER activity of Ni3S4/N,P-HPC are not neglected. The 3D porous architecture of N,P-HPC possibly endows catalyst with large active area and more accessible catalytic active sites. To confirm this point, the electrochemical double layer capacitance (*C*dl) was also determined by cyclic voltammetry at different sweeping rates (Figure S8), as it is linearly proportional to the electrochemical active surface area (ECSA).[24] From Figure 5e, the Cdl value of pure N,P-HPC (9.4 mF cm‒2 ) is close to RuO<sup>2</sup> (9.9 mF cm‒2 ), but it is lower than that of the Ni3S4/N,P-HPC (17.0 mF cm‒2 ), indicating the significantly improved ECSA after the incorporation of Ni3S<sup>4</sup> particles and N,P-HPC. Aside from the good activity, the developed Ni3S4/N,P-HPC also demonstrate outstanding stability for the OER. In the extended

chronoamperometric test (Figure 5f), the Ni3S4/N,P-HPC exhibits only a current attenuation of about 23% after 10000 s continuous running, which is obviously lower than that of commercial RuO<sup>2</sup> catalyst (45%). Since industrial alkaline water electrolysis typically operates under rather harsh conditions, thus additional electrochemical measurements for the OER in 1.0 M KOH solution were performed, including LSV polarization curves, the cycling and long-term stability. At a current density of 100 mA cm−2 , the Ni3S4/N,P-HPC deliver a lower overpotential of 0.44 V (Figure S9a) than that of RuO<sup>2</sup> (0.47 V), Ni/N,P-HPC (0.56 V) and N,P-HPC (0.66 V). After the 1000 cycles, the overpotential of Ni3S4/N,P-HPC at 100 mA cm-2 only decreased about 20 mV (Figure S9b). Even continuous chronoamperometric test for 24 h on Ni3S4/N,P-HPC, the current density still remained about 62 % of the starting value (Figure S9c). These electrochemical results validate the Ni3S4/N,P-HPC can act as an active and robust electrocatalyst for the OER.

The excellent electrocatalytic properties for the OER can be reasonably attributed to the synergy between porous N,P-HPC and Ni3S<sup>4</sup> phase: (i) The Ni3S4/N,P-HPC have a high BET specific surface area usable for electrode/electrolyte interfaces; (ii) The successfully doping of N, P elements in carbon increase electronic conductivity of active Ni3S4/N,P-HPC material; (iii) The close contact between porous N,P-HPC and Ni3S<sup>4</sup> particles favors the exposure of more active-sites and offers abundant channels for the rapid mass transfer; (iv) The Ni3S<sup>4</sup> particles that are firmly embedded in the 3D porous carbon aerogels can effectively inhibit the selfaggregation and dissolution of active component, leading to improved stability.[25] After the stability test, the overall morphology and structure of the Ni3S4/N,P-HPC material were well preserved (Figure 6a-6b); (v) Last but not the least, the harsh OER condition possibly leads to

the transformation of Ni3S<sup>4</sup> to their oxide/hydroxide forms.[26] The Ni3S4/N,P-HPC catalyst after the OER stability test in 0.1 M KOH was also analyzed by XPS. A comparison of XPS spectra before and after the stability test, the Ni2+ and Ni3+ cations are still preserved in the recovered Ni3S4/N,P-HPC sample (Figure 6c). The main differences are that the intensities of the peaks have been changed after the stability test. In the S 2p region (Figure 6d), the recovered Ni3S4/N,P-HPC displays an intensity decrease at 168.8 eV (corresponding to S-O species), confirming the partial oxidation of Ni3S4. This oxidation phenomenon was also revealed by the increased intensity of high-resolution O 1s spectrum (Figure S10). Above XPS results indicate the possible transformation of Ni3S<sup>4</sup> to its oxide/hydroxides, which may be another reason to contribute the high OER activity.[26]

### **3. Conclusion**

In conclusion, we proposed a novel hydrogel strategy to design and construct an active OER electrocatalyst consisting of Ni3S<sup>4</sup> particles embedded in honeycomb porous N, P-carbon aerogels (Ni3S4/N,P-HPC). The formation of hydrogel depends on a simple sol−gel polymerization of CS, TPP and PHMG that contains abundant metal-binding sites allowing Ni ions to be incorporated into the gel-structure uniformly. Our strategy in principle guarantees the uniform anchoring of Ni3S<sup>4</sup> particles in the carbon aerogels and the formation of honeycomb porous carbon matrix with desired N, P-doping. The excellent electrocatalytic activity and stability of the obtained Ni3S4/N,P-HPC on OER were demonstrated subsequently in alkaline medium. The overpotential at 10 mA cm−2 (0.37 V) and the Tafel slope (96 mV dec‒1 ) are comparable to many of other reported OER catalysts, and being close to commercial RuO<sup>2</sup> catalyst. Such good OER activity may be ascribed to the intrinsic electrocatalytic property of

Ni3S<sup>4</sup> active component, while the strong interactions of Ni3S<sup>4</sup> particles with porous carbon aerogels assist in exposing the active sites and improving the charge transport, leading to the optimal OER activity. In view of simple synthetic method and excellent electrocatalytic properties, we believe that Ni3S4/N,P-HPC can find potential applications in energy storage and conversion fields.

**Abstract:** An iron oxide decorated nickel iron alloy nanoparticle/porous graphene hybrid exhibits high electrocatalytic activity and excellent durability toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER). It displays a low overpotential of 274 mV at 10 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> , and low Tafel slope of 37 mV/dec, showing a superior performance to the state-of-the-art RuO2OER electrocatalyst.

Due to increasing concerns about depletion of the nonrenewable natural resources including gas, oil, and coal, much effort has been made to develop next generation clean and sustainable energy sources. [\[1\]](#page-4-0) Hydrogen (H2), produced from electrochemical water splitting (2H2O → 2H<sup>2</sup> + O2) has been widely regarded as a promising and renewable energy source to replace traditional fossil fuels, because water is not only the sole starting material for H<sup>2</sup> production but also the sole byproduct when H<sup>2</sup> is consumed to provide electricity. [\[2\]](#page-4-1) Nevertheless, because of the sluggish four-proton-couple electron transfer and rigid oxygen-oxygen double bond, oxygen evolution reaction (OER), as an important half-reaction in the water splitting, requires introduction of efficient electrocatalysts to reduce the overpotentials and further accelerate the reaction rate.[\[3\]](#page-4-2) At present, iridium dioxide (IrO2) and ruthenium dioxide (RuO2) have been found as the most efficient OER catalysts.[\[4\]](#page-4-3) However, large-scale application of these noble metal based catalysts is hindered due to their scarcity, high price, and poor stability.[\[5\]](#page-4-4) Therefore, it is highly desirable to develop more efficient, robust, and stable OER electrocatalysts from earth-abundant elements.

Metal-organic compounds such as metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as promising precursors for fabrication of well-defined nanocatalysts.[\[6\]](#page-4-5) Under certain pyrolysis conditions, these materials can be easily converted into nanoparticles/carbon hybrid nanomaterials for catalytic applications. In the past decade, we successfully prepared diverse pyrogallol[4]arene-based nanocapsules, such as M8L2, M7L2, M24L6, and M18L6. [\[7\]](#page-4-6) In particular, the M24L<sup>6</sup> nanocapsule typically involves six pyrogallol[4]arenes and 24 metal ions with remarkable enclosed

void space, ~ 1400 Å<sup>3</sup> . Recently, we further demonstrated that these hexameric nanocapsules can self-organize into various 2- D and 3-D supramolecular coordination polymers (SCPs) by using C-propan-3-ol pyrogallol[4]arene. [\[8\]](#page-4-7) For example, in SCP-3- Ni, each Ni24L<sup>6</sup> nanocapsule is connected with eight others through eight alkyl chains.[\[9\]](#page-4-8) Moreover, compared with discrete nanocapsules and 2-D SCPs, SCP-3-Ni as a representative 3-D SCP shows an improved stability in the solid state upon loss of solvent molecules and exposure to air. As one class of metalorganic compounds, these SCPs show prominent potential as precursors in the preparation of nanocatalysts compared to conventional MOFs. The confinement effect of the nanocapsules may effectively prevents agglomeration of nanoparticles during thermal treatment and offers opportunities for the formation of nanocatalysts down to nano or even atomic size.[\[10\]](#page-4-9) In addition, the strong host-guest interactions make these 3-D nanocapsulebased SCPs as great solid solutes for the synthesis of welldefined alloy nanoparticles and nanocomposites.

(c) The corresponding elemental mapping of C, O, Ni and Fe. (d) HRTEM images of FeNi3-Fe3O<sup>4</sup> NPs/LIG. (e) XRD pattern of the FeNi3-Fe3O<sup>4</sup> NPs/LIG.

On the basis of the above possibilities offered by the SCPs, we report an OER electrocatalyst based on 3-D SCPs derived

nanomaterials. Herein, we adopted SCP-3-Ni as the precursor and successfully *in-situ* prepared iron oxide decorated nickel iron alloy nanoparticles anchored on laser induced graphene (denoted as FeNi3-Fe3O4NPs/LIG) via laser induced solid phase reaction. SCP-3-Ni was prepared by our previously reported solvo-thermal reaction between C-propan-3-olpyrogallol[4]arene and nickel nitrate (see Supporting information for more details).[\[9\]](#page-4-8) Thereafter, as shown in the Figure 1a, SCPs were dispersed in acetonitrile containing FeCl<sup>3</sup> and then dropped onto the as-synthesized LIG. The dried LIG/SCPs/FeCl<sup>3</sup> precursor was subsequently scribed by the CO<sup>2</sup> laser in the air. The transient generated high temperature and pressure can decompose the SCP-3-Ni in a short time and facilitate the formation of the final product. The obtained FeNi3-Fe3O4NPs/LIG catalyst displays remarkable OER catalytic performance, in terms of a low overpotential of 274 mV at 10 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> , a small Tafel slope of 37 mV/dec, as well as excellent stability, showing a superior performance to the stateof-the-art RuO<sup>2</sup> electrocatalyst.

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed to characterize the morphology and structure. As shown in Figure S2 (Supporting Information), the LIG shows a porous structure which is in accordance with our previous reports.[\[11\]](#page-4-10) This property was successfully inherited by the FeNi3-Fe3O4NPs/LIG (Figure 1b), which is responsible for the high surface area and is beneficial to interfacial reaction. Meanwhile, Figure 1b also shows that the nanoparticles are well dispersed on the surface of the LIG sheets. The corresponding elemental mapping confirms the existence of the C, O, Fe, and Ni elements and their uniform distribution. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) clearly shows that the nanoparticles with dominant size in the range 20- 30 nm are well anchored to graphene layers and evenly distributed as shown in Figure S3 (Supporting Information). The relatively uniform size distribution can be attributed to a short laser duration, specifically the generated intermediates will quickly undergo nucleation and crystallization processes, therefore nucleus will stop growing due to a quick removal of localized reaction conditions from laser induction. The High-resolution TEM (HRTEM) was further performed to investigate the nanostructures in more details. The HRTEM image (Figure 1d) reveals wellresolved lattice fringes with interplanar distances of 0.205 nm, 0.290 nm and 0.364 nm, corresponding to the (111) plane of FeNi3, (220) plane of Fe3O<sup>4</sup> and (002) plane of graphene, respectively. Meanwhile, it is interesting to see that FeNi<sup>3</sup> NPs are surrounded by few-layer graphene which might be formed due to the quick carbonization of the SCP-3-Ni. In order to characterize structures of the obtained material, powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) was employed. As shown in Figure 1e, a main peak at 26° is observed, which can be assigned to the (002) plane of the graphitic layers. The diffraction peaks centered at 43.7° and 50.7° match well with the (111) and (200) planes of the cubic FeNi<sup>3</sup> (JCPDS NO. 38- 0419). Meanwhile, the peaks corresponding to Fe3O<sup>4</sup> are also found in the pattern. The existence of the Fe3O<sup>4</sup> may be caused by the oxidation of excessive Fe. These results are in good agreement with those shown in Figure 1d. The Raman spectrum of FeNi3-Fe3O4NPs/LIG (Figure S4 Supporting Information) exhibits three characteristic peaks at ~1350 cm-1 , ~1580 cm-1 and ~2655 cm-1 , corresponding to the D, G and 2D peaks of the graphene, respectively.

**Figure 2.** XPS spectra: (a) Fe 2p, (b) Ni 2p, (c) C 1s and (d) O 1s of FeNi3- Fe3O<sup>4</sup> NPs/LIG.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) has been employed to investigate the surface chemical states of the characteristic elements in the FeNi3-Fe3O4NPs/LIG. The XPS spectra shown in Figure S5 (Supporting Information) confirms the existence of Ni, Fe, C, O, and N elements, and the atomic ratio of Fe and Ni is calculated to be 1:1.7 (0.39 at%:0.67 at%). We note that a trace amount of N comes from the LIG, as proved by the previous study.[\[11\]](#page-4-10) As shown in Figure 2a, in the Fe 2p region, two dominant peaks at binding energies of 710.8 eV and 724.4 eV correspond to Fe 2p3/2 and Fe 2p1/2 spin orbit peaks, respectively.[\[13\]](#page-4-12) Because of the small chemical shift between Fe2+ and Fe3+ in Fe3O4, the Fe 2p peaks are relatively broad.[\[14\]](#page-4-13) Moreover, a small peak centered at ~ 706 eV confirms the existence of zero-valent Fe<sup>0</sup> . The Ni 2p XPS spectrum (Figure 2b) shows two peaks centered at 852.6 eV and 855.8 eV which can be ascribed to metallic Ni and Ni2+, respectively.[\[15\]](#page-4-14) Meanwhile, the peak at 861.6 eV is the satellite peak for Ni2+ . [\[16\]](#page-4-15) The binding energies of C 1s centered at 284.6 e V and 285.2 e V can be assigned to C-C and C-O bonds, respectively (Figure 2c).[\[11\]](#page-4-10) The O 1S spectrum in Figure 2d has two peaks at 531.84 eV and 530.18 eV, corresponding to Fe-OH, and Fe-O, respectively.[\[17\]](#page-4-16) Our XPS results further confirm the formation of FeNi3-Fe3O4NPs/LIG.

OER electrocatalytic activity of the FeNi3-Fe3O4NPs/LIG was assessed by using standard three-electrode setup in O2 saturated 1.0 M KOH electrolyte. In order to compensate the potential loss caused by the external resistance and accurately reflect the intrinsic catalytic activity of the electrocatalyst, an IR correction was employed. All the reference electrodes reported here were calibrated with respect to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). The detailed calibration method is shown in Figure S8 (Supporting Information). As comparison, glassy carbon, RuO2and LIG were also tested.

(b) Corresponding Tafel plots of LSV curves shown in (a). (c) Polarization curves of the FeNi3-Fe3O<sup>4</sup> NPs/LIG before and after 1000 cycles of CV scans. (d) Chronopotentiometry plot of the OER process operated with the FeNi3-Fe3O<sup>4</sup> NPs/LIG at a constant current density of 10 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> .

Meanwhile, in order to explore the effect of Fe3O4, a reduced sample (FeNi3-Fe3O4NPs/LIG-R) was prepared by annealing FeNi3-Fe3O4NPs/LIG at 300℃ in 5% H2/ 95% Ar flow. As evidenced by the Figure S4 and S6 (Supporting information), there are no observed characteristic peaks for Fe3O<sup>4</sup> in both Raman spectrum and XRD pattern of FeNi3-Fe3O4 NPs/LIG-R, suggesting reduction of oxides in the hybrid catalyst. No obvious structural change was observed after the annealing (Figure S7 Supporting Information), which can be attributed to the possible outcome of the high FeNi3-Fe3O4NPs/LIG synthesis temperature induced by the laser. Figure 3a shows the anode polarization curves recorded at 2 mV/s. As expected, RuO<sup>2</sup> displays a good OER activity with an onset overpotential of 270 mV, whereas the bare glassy carbon and LIG shows no catalytic activity. It is very interesting to see that FeNi3-Fe3O4NPs/LIG show better performance than the benchmark RuO2. It only needs an overpotential of 274 mV to achieve 10 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> . However, FeNi3-Fe3O4 NPs/LIG-R exhibits an increase overpotential of 323 mV. The superior OER activity of FeNi3-Fe3O4NPs/LIG to the reduced sample could be attributed to the modification of surface electronic state of FeNi<sup>3</sup> caused by the Fe3O4. Similar effect has also been reported in other work.[\[15,](#page-4-14) [18\]](#page-4-17)

The Tafel slopes derived from the corresponding polarization curves are shown in Figure 3b to get more insight into the reaction mechanism. These Tafel slopes are fitted according to the following equation η= b log j + a, where j is the current density and b is the Tafel slope. The Tafel slope of RuO<sup>2</sup> is 75 mV/dec, while FeNi3-Fe3O4NPs/LIG has a Tafel slope of 37 mV/dec which is smaller than that of FeNi3-Fe3O4NPs/LIG-R (41 mV/dec), suggesting its fast reaction kinetics. Stability of FeNi3-Fe3O<sup>4</sup>

(c) Capacitive currents at 0.896 V (vs RHE) as a function of the scan rate for FeNi3-Fe3O<sup>4</sup> NPs/LIG and FeNi3-Fe3O<sup>4</sup> NPs/LIG-R (Δj<sup>0</sup> = ja − jc). (d) Nyquist plots of FeNi3-Fe3O<sup>4</sup> NPs/LIG and FeNi3-Fe3O<sup>4</sup> NPs/LIG-R.

NPs/LIG was assessed by the continuous cyclic voltammetry scanning. Figure 3c shows anode polarization curves at the first cycle and after 1000 cycles. The almost overlapped curves imply the excellent stability of FeNi3-Fe3O4/LIG. Chronopotentiometric measurements at a fixed current density of 10 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> were also conducted. As shown in Figure 3d, FeNi3-Fe3O4NPs/LIG maintains its high catalytic activity with only a slight increase of overpotential of 9 mV after 18 hours testing, which could be attributed to the formation and desorption of the copious O<sup>2</sup> bubbles on the catalyst surface.

In order to elucidate the high OER performance of FeNi3- Fe3O4NPs/LIG, the electrochemical double layer capacitance (Cdl) was calculated by conducting cyclic voltammograms in a non-Faradaic capacitive current range to estimate the electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) (Figure 4a and b), as Cdl is linearly proportional to the ECSA.[\[19\]](#page-4-18) As shown in Figure 4c the capacitance of the FeNi3-Fe3O4NPs/LIG is larger than that of the FeNi3-Fe3O<sup>4</sup> NPs/LIG-R, indicating its higher surface area and more exposed active sites for OER catalysis. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was conducted to investigate the catalytic kinetics under OER process. Nyquist plots of FeNi3-Fe3O4NPs/LIG and FeNi3-Fe3O4NPs/LIG-R are show in Figure 4d, showing that FeNi3-Fe3O4NPs/LIG has a much lower charge transfer resistance than FeNi3-Fe3O4 NPs/LIG-R, which is in accord with the result of its lower Tafel slope.

The abovementioned results also indicate that the high OER catalytic properties of FeNi3-Fe3O4NPs/LIG can be partly ascribed to the decoration of Fe3O4. The possible mechanisms of catalysts promoted by transition metals for the OER have been proposed by several previous reports. Among different steps in the OER process, formation rate of \*OOH intermediates could be the limiting factor that determines the production rate of oxygen molecules. [\[21\]](#page-4-20) Acceleration of \*OOH formation was believed to promote the whole reaction. The decoration of Fe3O<sup>4</sup> is beneficial to the

formation of \*OOH. [\[22\]](#page-4-21) Because, the strong electron interactions between Fe3O<sup>4</sup> and FeNi<sup>3</sup> would change the surface electronic states of FeNi3, leading to the enhancement of the electrophilicity of the adsorbed O, thus facilitating the formation of \*OOH. [\[20b,](#page-4-22) [23\]](#page-4-23) They also promote the deprotonation of the \*OOH species via electronwithdrawing inductive effect to produce O<sup>2</sup> molecules. [\[24\]](#page-4-24)

In summary, an electrocatalyst based on iron oxide decorated nickel iron alloy nanoparticles and LIG hybrid nanomaterial has been successfully developed by laser assisted solid phase reaction using only a mixture of SCP and FeCl<sup>3</sup> as precursors inside the porous graphene. This hybrid material shows superior catalytic performance and stability toward OER in alkaline media. The high activity of the FeNi3-Fe3O4NPs/LIG can be attributed to the following reasons: (1) The unique structure of the SCP prevents the aggregation during the growth of the nanoparticles. (2) Porous graphene as host material enables the high surface area. (3) The decoration of the Fe3O<sup>4</sup> significantly enhances the OER catalytic activity.

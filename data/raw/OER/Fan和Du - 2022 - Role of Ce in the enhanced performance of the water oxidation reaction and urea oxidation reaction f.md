# Role of Ce in the enhanced performance of the water oxidation reaction and urea oxidation reaction for NiFe layered double hydroxides†

Jianfeng Fan<sup>a</sup> and Xiaoqiang Du \*b

Atomic doping and surface engineering are regarded as a promising method for improving their electrochemistry performance toward the water oxidation reaction and urea oxidation reaction (UOR) for layered double hydroxides (LDHs) containing low cost transition metals. However, the mechanism of how foreign ion doping and interface construction enhance catalytic activity remains unclear. In this work, NiFe LDH is reported as an example where Ce (Ce-NiFe LDH) is doped or the interface is constructed with Ce(OH)<sub>3</sub>(Ce(OH)<sub>3</sub>@NiFe LDH), and water oxidation and urea oxidation reaction are used as probe reactions. The Ce(OH)<sub>3</sub>@NiFe LDH material shows superior electrocatalytic performance for the water oxidation reaction (at an overpotential of 220 mV@10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>) and urea oxidation reaction (at a potential of 1.40 V@10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>), which is one of the best electrocatalytic performances reported so far. After a long time of stability testing, it was found that the catalytic current had significant attenuation, and further characterization showed that the surface of the electrode would be oxidized to oxyhydroxide, which is the true active species. The experimental results demonstrate that foreign Ce and Fe atom doping and interface construction improve the exposure of active centres, enhance the electron transfer rate and reduce the impedance of the NiFe LDH material. It is worth noting that this work provides new ideas for designing efficient, stable and environmentally friendly catalysts for water splitting and urea oxidation by means of doping and interface construction

# 1. Introduction

The relatively rapid burning of fossil fuels is gradually attracting attention as a primary cause of the energy crisis and environmental pollution. To address this issue, a lot of effort has been made on efficient renewable resources and sustainable energy storage technologies, such as electrolysis of water, supercapacitors and solar fuel cells. <sup>1–8</sup> Notably, water splitting into hydrogen *via* electricity is considered as one of the most promising approaches. Water splitting involves two half reactions, namely the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). <sup>9–11</sup> The oxygen evolution reaction is considered as the bottleneck and rate determining step of water splitting because the electron transfer and proton

lamella acquire a positive charge. The interlayer exchangeable

anion balances the positive charge on the lamella, making the

coupling processes of four electrons and four protons. What is

noteworthy is that the reported most active catalysts so far are

materials and derivatives containing iridium and ruthenium for water oxidation. 12-14 However, the exorbitant price, scarcity

and instability of precious metals limit their usefulness. Therefore, it is very necessary to investigate environmentally friendly, cheap and robust transition metal materials. 15-18 Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) are novel inorganic functional catalysts with layered structures. The chemical composition of LDHs is closely related to the cationic properties of LDHs, the charge density or anion exchange capacity of LDHs and their supramolecular intercalation structures. NiFe LDHs,  $([Ni_{1-x}Fe_x(OH)_2](A^{n-})_{x/n}\cdot mH_2O)$ , are among the most efficient and robust materials for the water oxidation reaction in an alkaline medium,19 whose electrocatalytic performance is better than those of perovskite oxides, 20 precious metal-based materials, spinel oxides<sup>21</sup> and other low cost materials.<sup>22-29</sup> The structure of NiFe LDHs is very similar to that of magnesite [Ni(OH)<sub>3</sub>], and the unit layer is formed by the common edge of the NiO6 octahedron. Ni located on the layer can be replaced with isomorphous Fe in a certain range, which makes the

overall structure of NiFe LDHs electrically neutral. In addition, there is interlaminar water in LDHs and water molecules can be removed without destroying the lamellar structure. It has been reported that the doping of iron ions can improve the electrocatalytic activity of metal oxides or hydroxides, although its role and catalytic mechanism are not fully understood.<sup>30</sup>

Various approaches have been attempted to explore the mechanism of the oxygen evolution reaction and improve the performance of oxygen evolution. The introduction of foreign ions, such as W, 31 Ce, V, 32 Ru 33 and Co, can regulate the electron configuration and active site density of NiFe LDH materials, which can help decrease the generation energy of the transition state.<sup>34</sup> The introduction of foreign ions can enter the lattice of the LDH material through doping to form polybasic hydroxides, 35,36 and can also build an interface to form hybrid materials.<sup>37-41</sup> The doping of foreign ions can regulate and control the electron configuration and charge density of the active sites for the host material without generating an unwanted hybrid phase. Moreover, on the other hand, the interfaces can also be constructed to regulate the synergistic effects of materials and the created interfaces can regulate the atomic arrangement and active sites of the host material. It is worth mentioning that the two materials in the hybrid material can cooperate with each other to reduce the resistance of the material on the one hand, and to optimize the activation energy of the intermediate in water splitting as a hydrogen acceptor on the other hand. It is also worth mentioning that although many efforts have been made, both the catalytic activity and the stability of the material need to be further improved. Since the thermodynamics of the oxygen evolution reaction is unfavorable, easily oxidized molecules such as methanol or urea can be selected instead of water molecules to produce hydrogen. The oxidation of urea can not only solve the energy crisis but also treat the wastewater rich in urea. 42,43 According to the reports in the literature, the influence of foreign ion doping or interface construction on the catalytic activity for the OER and UOR has not been systematically studied.

In this work, NiFe LDH is reported as an example where Ce (Ce-NiFe LDH) is doped or the interface is constructed with Ce(OH)<sub>3</sub>(Ce(OH)<sub>3</sub>@NiFe LDH), and oxygen evolution and urea oxidation are used as probe reactions. The Ce(OH)3@NiFe LDH material exhibits superior electrocatalytic performance for the oxygen evolution reaction (at an overpotential of 220 mV@10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>) and urea oxidation reaction (at a potential of 1.40 V@10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>), which is one of the best electrochemical performances reported so far. After a long time of stability testing, it was found that the catalytic current had significant attenuation, and further characterization showed that the surface of the catalyst would be oxidized to oxyhydroxide, which is the true active species. The experimental results demonstrate that foreign Ce and Fe atom doping and interface construction promote the exposure of active centres, enhance the electron transfer rate and reduce the impedance of the NiFe LDH material. It is worth mentioning that this work provides new ideas for designing efficient, stable and environmentally friendly catalysts for water splitting and urea oxidation by means of doping and interface construction.

# 2. Experimental section

All used materials in this work were of analytical grade, and used without further treatment. Reagents for the electrolyte synthesis, Ni(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>·6H<sub>2</sub>O, Fe(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>·9H<sub>2</sub>O, Ce(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>, CO(NH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, NH<sub>4</sub>F, and KOH, were bought from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent (Co., Ltd). Ni foam was obtained from Shenzhen Green and Creative Environmental Science and Technology Co. Ltd. Ethanol was bought from Aladdin Ltd (Shanghai, China).

#### 2.1 Preparation of Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> and NiFe LDH nanoarrays

For the preparation of Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> nanoarrays, Ni foam was first broken up into a rectangle (2 × 3 cm<sup>2</sup>) and treated with ultrasound in 3 M hydrochloric acid for 20 min to wash off impurities and oxides from the surface of nickel foam, followed by ultrasound with C2H5OH and distilled water for 20 min, respectively. In a typical method, Ni(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>·6H<sub>2</sub>O (2.5 mmol), NH<sub>4</sub>F (5 mmol) and CO(NH)<sub>2</sub> (12 mmol) were dissolved in 35 mL distilled water to obtain a pellucid, homogeneous solution. Then the above solution and this cleaned foamed nickel were inserted vertically into a 50 mL Teflon autoclave vessel and kept at a temperature to 120 °C for 8 h. After the reactor was maintained at 25 °C, the Ni foam with materials was taken out and rinsed with ethanol and distilled water several times. For the preparation of the NiFe LDH nanoarray, the same process was adopted except that Ni(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>·6H<sub>2</sub>O was superseded with a 4:1 mixture of Ni(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>·6H<sub>2</sub>O (2 mmol) and Fe  $(NO_3)_3 \cdot 9H_2O (0.5 \text{ mmol}).$ 

# 2.2 Preparation of Ce-NiFe LDH and Ce(OH)<sub>3</sub>@NiFe LDH nanoarrays

Ce atom doped NiFe LDH nanoarrays (Ce-NiFe LDH) were synthesized by a typical hydrothermal method with the same process as that for the NiFe LDH nanoarray except that  $Ce(NO_3)_3$  (0.5 mmol) was also dissolved in the mixture solution. NiFe LDH nanoarrays heterogeneously loaded with  $Ce(OH)_3$  nanoparticles ( $Ce(OH)_3$ @NiFe LDH) were prepared by a two-step process under weakly alkaline conditions to prevent Ce doping through an ionic exchange approach.  $Ce(NO_3)_3$  (0.5 mmol),  $NH_4F$  (1 mmol) and  $CO(NH_2)_2$  (2.5 mmol) were dispersed in 35 mL of distilled water to obtain a clear, homogeneous solution. Then the above solution and this cleaned Ni foam with NiFe LDH were vertically immersed in a 50 mL Teflon autoclave vessel and heated to 120 °C for 5 h. The mass loading of NiFe LDH, Ce-NiFe LDH and  $Ce(OH)_3$ @NiFe LDH was 1.8 mg cm<sup>-2</sup>, 2.1 mg cm<sup>-2</sup> and 2.3 mg cm<sup>-2</sup>, respectively.

### 2.3 Material characterization

X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ThermoFisher Scientific ESCALAB) were also performed to determine the composition and oxidation state of the

samples. To investigate the morphology of the electrodes, field emission scanning electron microcopy (FESEM, Hitachi, Japan) was carried out. An energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscope (EDS) was employed to examine the elemental percentage and mapping of Ni, Ce, Fe and O on the Ce-NiFe LDH and Ce(OH)<sub>3</sub>(a)NiFe LDH electrocatalysts.

#### 2.4 Electrochemical measurements

electrochemical workstation (Shanghai Chenhua) was applied to perform all the electrocatalytic measurements. A typical three-electrode device was used, where graphite and Ag/ AgCl were used as the counter and reference electrode, and Ni foam with the resulting materials was employed as the working electrode. In electrochemical tests the electrolyte was 1.0 M KOH for the OER and 1.0 M KOH with 0.50 M urea for the UOR. Moreover, all electrocatalytic measurements were carried out at 25 °C. To investigate the electrochemical performance of the electrodes, linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was performed at a scanning rate of 5 mV s<sup>-1</sup> by an iR-compensation of 70%. What is noteworthy is that each of the LSV tests was performed three times in order to ensure the reliability of the data. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed at frequencies ranging from 100 kHz to 0.01 Hz to study the electrochemical impedance and electrical conductivity of the electrodes. Chronoamperometry tests were performed at current densities of 18 and 16 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> for 12 h to assess the long-term electrocatalytic stability of the OER and UOR for the Ce(OH)3@NiFe LDH electrocatalysts. The used potentials were converted versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) based on the following formula (1):

$$V_{\text{RHE}} = V \left( \nu s._{\text{Ag/AgCl}} \right) + 0.197 + 0.059 \times \text{pH}.$$

# Results and discussion

Scheme 1 shows the composition diagram of the NiFe LDH, CeNiFe LDH and Ce(OH)3@NiFe LDH materials. Firstly, the nickel foam substrate is pretreated to eliminate the oxides and impurities on the substrate surface. For the synthesis of NiFe LDH and Ce-NiFe LDH, ammonium fluoride plays a role in regulating the morphology in order to form an intersecting nanosheet array. The role of urea is to provide a weakly alka-

line environment during the heating process. It slowly released OH and CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup> ions, and the metal ions were combined to form a precipitate, which was loaded on the surface of the foamed nickel. During the synthesis of Ce(OH)3@NiFe-LDH hybrid materials, the concentration of ammonium fluoride and urea is reduced in order to control the loading capacity of Ce(OH)<sub>3</sub>. The provided weakly alkaline environment by urea further avoids the doping and ion exchange of the Ce ion.

To investigate and survey the composition, purity and crystal phase of the electrodes, X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) characterization was performed. As presented in Fig. 1, three distinct strong peaks at 44.6°, 52.2° and 76.3° are observed, and are attributed to the (111), (200) and (220) diffraction planes of the nickel foam. Other characteristic peaks are also observed, and the characteristic diffraction peaks of the NiFe LDH, Ce-NiFe LDH and Ce(OH)3@NiFe LDH materials correspond to Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> (PDF no. 38-0715). The peaks at 11.9°, 23.2°, 34.6°, 38.5°, 60.1° and 62.1° correspond to the (003), (006), (012), (015), (110) and (113) diffraction planes of Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>. It is important to note that the diffraction peak is offset due to the doping of iron and cerium but no other impurities are formed. For this Ce(OH)<sub>3</sub>@NiFe LDH material, the diffraction peak of Ce(OH)<sub>3</sub> at 27.9° was observed, demonstrating that the Ce (OH)3@NiFe-LDH hvbrid material was successfully synthesized.

In order to study the morphology of the material, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis was carried out. As presented in Fig. 2a and b, the Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> material shows a relatively thin nanosheet morphology. Each nanosheet is superimposed on top of each other and vertically overlays the surface of the foamed nickel substrate. It is worth emphasizing that the doping of Fe (Fig. 2c and d) or Ce (Fig. 2e and f) hardly affects the morphology of the material, and the morphology of the nanosheet is retained. However, for this Ce(OH)3@NiFe-LDH material, although the main morphology of the nanosheet is preserved, there are small nanoparticles attached to the surface of the nanosheet (Fig. 2g and h). The small nano-

particles can be attributed to Ce(OH)3. SEM characterization demonstrated that these materials were successfully prepared. What is noteworthy is that the open network structure is favorable for substrate adsorption, electrolyte diffusion and transmission and bubble overflow.

For the sake of further studying the microcosmic shape and internal structure of the Ce-NiFe LDH and Ce(OH)3@NiFe LDH catalysts, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high resolution TEM characterization were carried out. As presented in Fig. 3a, the Ce-NiFe LDH material displays a thin nanosheet

morphology, which was consistent with SEM analysis. As shown in Fig. 3b, clearly lattice fringes are observed, and only a 0.262 nm single lattice fringe appears, which is attributed to the (012) crystal planes of NiFe LDH. Elemental mapping (Fig. 3c) also further proves that the Ce-NiFe LDH material has been successfully synthesized. In contrast to the characterization of Ce-NiFe LDH, the morphology of the nanosheet is still clearly visible and the nanoparticles are clearly observed for the Ce(OH)<sub>3</sub>@NiFe LDH material (Fig. 3d). Two different lattice fringes can be observed (Fig. 3e); lattice fringes of 0.262 nm and 0.314 nm correspond to the (012) crystal planes of NiFe LDH and the (101) crystal planes of Ce(OH)<sub>3</sub>. Element mapping (Fig. 3f) also further proves that the Ce(OH)<sub>3</sub>@NiFe LDH material has been successfully synthesized.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was performed to investigate the surface properties and oxidation states of NiFe LDH, Ce-NiFe LDH and Ce(OH)3@NiFe LDH. The full spectra of NiFe LDH, Ce-NiFe LDH and Ce(OH)<sub>3</sub>@NiFe LDH (Fig. 4a) demonstrate the presence of Ce, Ni, Fe and O atoms without any other impurities. Fig. 4b shows the Ce 3d spectra of Ce-NiFe LDH and Ce(OH)3@NiFe LDH, which can be fitted to two sets of Ce  $3d_{3/2}$  and Ce  $3d_{5/2}$ peaks,44 and each set can be assigned to two Ce3+ peaks and three Ce4+ peaks. The peaks at 873.6 and 879.1 eV can be

attributed to  $Ce^{3+} 3d_{5/2}$ , and those at 875.5, 881.3 and 884.1 eV can be attributed to  $Ce^{4+}$   $3d_{5/2}$ . The peaks 899.1 and 905.0 eV can be assigned to  $\text{Ce}^{3+}$   $3d_{3/2}$ , and those at 902.5, 907.8 and 917.2 eV can be assigned to  $Ce^{4+}$   $3d_{3/2}$  (Tables S1 and S2†). For the Fe 2p spectrum, the peaks at 714.0 and 724.5 eV can be assigned to Fe 2p<sub>3/2</sub> and Fe 2p<sub>1/2</sub> with two satellite peaks for the NiFe LDH, which demonstrates the existence of the Fe<sup>3+</sup> oxidation state (Fig. 4c). 45 What is noteworthy is that the Fe  $2p_{3/2}$  and Fe  $2p_{1/2}$  peaks shift in the direction of low binding energy for Ce-NiFe LDH (713.6 and 724.3 eV) and Ce(OH)<sub>3</sub>@NiFe LDH (713.3 and 724.1 eV), respectively. The Ni 2p<sub>3/2</sub> and Ni 2p<sub>1/2</sub> peaks shift in the direction of high binding energy for the Ni 2p region of Ce-NiFe LDH and Ce(OH)<sub>3</sub>@NiFe LDH (Fig. 4d). The two peaks at 856.3 and 872.8 eV were assigned to Ni 2p<sub>3/2</sub> and Ni 2p<sub>1/2</sub> with the satellite ones at 861.5 and 885.2 eV in the Ni 2p spectrum of NiFe LDH, which is indicative of the Ni<sup>2+</sup> low state (Fig. 4d).<sup>46</sup> Compared with the Ni 2p<sub>3/2</sub> and 2p<sub>1/2</sub> peaks of NiFe LDH, these peaks shift in the direction of the high binding energies for Ce-NiFe LDH (0.1 and 0.1 eV) and Ce(OH)3@NiFe LDH (0.15 and 0.2 eV), respectively. The O 1s spectrum can be deconvoluted to two peaks at 531.4 and 532.8 eV which can be assigned to metal oxygen bond and adsorbed water (Fig. 4e). The shift of the Ni 2p and Fe 2p peaks due to the heterogeneous interface formed by the introduction of cerium proves that some electrons have been transferred from nickel to iron for the Ce(OH)<sub>3</sub>@NiFe LDH material. Because of the doping of cerium, the Ni 2p and Fe 2p peaks are also relatively shifted but to a lower degree relative to those of the Ce(OH)3@NiFe LDH material, indicating that the electron interaction between Ni and Fe is relatively weak for Ce-NiFe LDH. It is worth noting that the introduction of cerium increases the ability of electrons to transfer from nickel to iron to a greater extent both through doping and through interface construction. Cerium makes this process happen by coordinating with oxygen for Ce-NiFe LDH and Ce(OH)<sub>3</sub>@NiFe LDH.

To explore the water oxidation performance of the Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>/ NF, NiFe LDH/NF, Ce-NiFe LDH/NF and Ce(OH)3@NiFe LDH/ NF materials, a linear sweep voltammetry curve was obtained using a common three-electrode device in an alkaline medium (Fig. 5a). It would bring some difficulty in the determination of electrochemical performance because of the presence of a strong oxidation peak between 1.3 and 1.45 V; therefore, the reverse scanning technology was used. It is worth mentioning that the Ce(OH)3@NiFe LDH/NF catalyst exhibits superior electrochemical activity (Table S3†). The Ce(OH)3@NiFe LDH/ NF requires a smaller overpotential (270 mV) to drive the current density of 100 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> compared with Ce-NiFe LDH/ NF (300 mV), NiFe LDH/NF (320 mV) and Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>/NF (490 mV) (Fig. S1†). It is worth mentioning that the electrochemical activity of the Ce(OH)3@NiFe LDH/NF electrode is even more superior to that of RuO<sub>2</sub> (390 mV) (Fig. S2†). The electrochemical performance of nickel foam support was also examined so as to exclude the interference of foamed nickel. As we expected, the nickel foam support displayed poorer electrochemical activity (Fig. S3†). In addition, the

Ce(OH)<sub>3</sub>@NiFe LDH material exhibits an extremely large mass activity of 52.1 A g<sup>-1</sup> at an overpotential of 300 mV, which is higher than those of Ce-NiFe LDH (33.3 A g<sup>-1</sup>) and NiFe LDH (16.7 A g<sup>-1</sup>), respectively. Moreover, the approach yields a high turnover frequency (0.078 s<sup>-1</sup>) for the Ce(OH)<sub>3</sub>@NiFe LDH/NF material at an overpotential of 300 mV, which is higher than those of Ce-NiFe LDH/NF (0.031 s<sup>-1</sup>), and NiFe LDH/NF (0.016 s<sup>-1</sup>). For the sake of investigating the main factors affecting the electrocatalytic activity of the catalyst, the Tafel slope is provided. As far as we know, the Tafel slope is an evaluation index of how much the overpotential increases as the current increases, meaning that it indirectly reflects the rate of electron transfer during the water splitting process. The lower its value, the faster the electron transfer rate, and the better the catalytic performance of the electrode. As presented in Fig. 5b, Ce(OH)3@NiFe LDH/NF shows the smallest Tafel slope (25.6 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>) compared with Ce-NiFe LDH/NF (38.3 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>), NiFe LDH/NF (40.1 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>) and Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>/NF  $(63.7 \text{ mV } \text{dec}^{-1})$ , demonstrating that the overpotential increases little with the increase of the catalytic current for Ce(OH)3@NiFe LDH/NF. The electrochemical active area was assessed in order to further study which cause has a greater

impact on the catalytic performance. The electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) is reflected by the value of the double layer capacitance  $(C_{\rm dl})$ . In the potential range of the non-Faraday region, the cyclic voltammetry curves are obtained at different sweep speeds (Fig. S4†). Then, the current density under the same potential is selected to draw the relationship curve between the current density and different sweep speeds. The slope of the curve gives the double layer capacitance value, which can reflect the ECSA. As displayed in Fig. 5c, the  $Ce(OH)_3$  (a) NiFe LDH/NF catalyst shows the largest  $C_{dl}$  value (1.3 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>) compared to Ce-NiFe LDH/NF (0.9 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>), NiFe LDH/NF (0.37 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>) and Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>/NF (0.3 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>), suggesting that the Ce(OH)3@NiFe LDH/NF catalyst displays the exposure of more active centres for the electrocatalytic reaction. Since the conductivity of a material is also important for electrochemical reactions, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was also performed (Fig. 5d). What is noteworthy is that the as prepared electrodes exhibit a similar resistance curve. The resulting Nyquist plots also demonstrate that the Ce(OH)<sub>3</sub>@NiFe LDH/NF catalyst shows a smaller impedance in the lower frequency region compared with Ni(OH)2/NF, NiFe LDH/NF and Ce-NiFe LDH/NF, thus improving the electron transfer rate and electrochemical performance of water oxidation. Hence, the superior electrochemical performance of the Ce(OH)<sub>3</sub>@NiFe LDH/NF material could be attributable to the better conductivity, exposure of more active centers and more effective synergistic catalytic effect. What is noticeable is that the good catalytic activity is not enough for a good catalyst, and durability is also a criterion to assess the performance of the electrode. Therefore, the durability of the electrode was evaluated by the chronoamperometry test. As presented in the Fig. 5e, the catalytic current of the catalyst has obvious attenuation after a long time electrochemical test. The current density dropped from 17 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> to 12 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> with a reduction of 30%. Subsequently, the catalytic activity of the catalyst after 12 hours of reaction was tested again, and it was found that the electrochemical performance of the electrode after the reaction was also reduced compared to that of the fresh material (Fig. 5f), which was consistent with the above test results. Faraday efficiency is tested to see if electrical energy is converted to chemical energy and if side reactions occur. The experimental analysis showed that the Ce(OH)<sub>3</sub> @NiFe LDH/NF catalyst gave 100% efficiency, proving that all electrical resources can be stored as a chemical resource without the occurrence of side reactions (Fig. S5†).

A series of characterization studies such as XRD, SEM and XPS were performed to investigate whether the surface of the catalyst changed after the reaction and the true catalytic species during the reaction. As shown in Fig. S6,† there are no obvious changes in the characteristic diffraction peaks before and after the reaction and no characteristic diffraction peaks are observed. As shown in Fig. S7,† the surface morphology of the material hardly changes obviously after the reaction. XPS technology characterized the surface properties of the catalyst after the reaction. As presented in Fig. 6a-d, the high resolution spectra of Fe, Ni and Ce almost did not change signifi-

cantly, but the high resolution spectra of O did, which proved the formation of new oxygen-containing species. According to the literature, NiFe LDH is unstable and the catalyst surface is oxidized to NiOOH during the reaction process, 44 which is the true catalytic species. It is important to note that because the hydroxyl oxides produced are small or amorphous, they are not observed in the XRD characterization in this work. The question is, since NiOOH is a truly active species, why not just synthesize it? This is because the activity of directly synthesized NiOOH is not as good as that in situ generated, and NiOOH can form a heterogeneous interface with the intrinsic material. It is possible that this heterogeneous interface improves the catalytic activity of the materials.

To explore the urea oxidation activity of the Ni(OH)2/NF, NiFe LDH/NF, Ce-NiFe LDH/NF and Ce(OH)3@NiFe LDH/NF materials, a linear sweep voltammetry curve was obtained using a common three-electrode system in an alkaline medium (Fig. 7a). It would bring some difficulty in the determination of electrochemical performance because of the presence of a strong oxidation peak between 1.3 and 1.45 V; therefore, the reverse scanning technology was used. It is worth mentioning that the Ce(OH)3@NiFe LDH/NF catalyst exhibits superior electrochemical activity (Table S4†). The Ce(OH)3 @NiFe LDH/NF needs a smaller potential (1.40 V) to drive the current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> compared with Ce-NiFe LDH/NF (1.49 V), NiFe LDH/NF (1.52 V) and Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>/NF (1.54 V) (Fig. S8†).

factors affecting the electrocatalytic activity of the catalyst, the Tafel slope is provided. As far as we know, the Tafel slope is an evaluation index of how much the potential increases as the current increases, meaning that it indirectly reflects the rate of electron transfer during the urea oxidation process. The lower its value, the faster the electron transfer rate, and the better the catalytic performance of the electrode. As presented in Fig. 7b, Ce(OH)<sub>3</sub>@NiFe LDH/NF shows the lowest Tafel slope (30.3 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>) compared with Ce-NiFe LDH/NF (40.2 mV  $dec^{-1}$ ), NiFe LDH/NF (50.5 mV  $dec^{-1}$ ) and Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>/NF (70.8 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>), demonstrating that the potential increases little with the increase of the catalytic current for Ce (OH)<sub>3</sub>@NiFe LDH/NF. The ECSA was assessed in order to further study which cause has a greater impact on the catalytic activity. The electrochemical active area is reflected by the value of  $C_{\rm dl}$ . In the potential range of the non-Faraday region, the cyclic voltammetry curves are recorded at different sweep speeds (Fig. S9†). Then, the current density under the same potential is selected to draw the relationship curve between the current density and different sweep speed. The slope of the curve gives the double layer capacitance value, which can reflect the electrochemical active area. As displayed in Fig. 7c,

the Ce(OH)<sub>3</sub>@NiFe LDH/NF catalyst shows the largest  $C_{dl}$  value (0.8 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>) compared to Ce-NiFe LDH/NF (0.38 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>), NiFe LDH/NF (0.2 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>) and Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>/NF (0.195 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>), suggesting that the Ce(OH)3@NiFe LDH/NF catalyst displays the exposure of more active centres for the electrocatalytic reaction. Since the conductivity of a material is also important for electrochemical reactions, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was also performed (Fig. 7d). What is noteworthy is that the as prepared electrodes show a similar resistance curve. The resulting Nyquist plots also demonstrate that the Ce(OH)<sub>3</sub>@NiFe LDH/NF catalyst shows a smaller impedance in the lower frequency region compared with Ni(OH)2/NF, NiFe LDH/NF and Ce-NiFe LDH/NF, thus improving the electron transfer rate and electrochemical performance of urea oxidation. Hence, the superior electrochemical performance of the Ce(OH)3@NiFe LDH/NF electrode could be attributable to the better conductivity, exposure of more active centers and more effective synergistic catalytic effect. What is noticeable is that the good catalytic activity is not enough for a good catalyst, and durability is also an evaluation indicator to assess the activity of the electrode. Therefore, the stability of the electrode was evaluated by the chronoamperometry test. As presented in Fig. 7e, the catalytic current of the catalyst has obvious attenuation after a long time electrocatalytic measurement. The current density dropped from 16 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> to 13 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> with a reduction of 28%. Subsequently, the catalytic activity of the catalyst after 12 hours of reaction was tested again, and it was found that the catalytic performance of the electrode after the reaction was also reduced compared to that of the fresh material (Fig. 7f), which was consistent with the above test results.

A series of characterization studies such as XRD and SEM were performed to investigate whether the surface of the catalyst changed after the reaction and the pure catalytic species during the reaction. As shown in Fig. S10,† there are no obvious changes in the characteristic diffraction peaks before and after the reaction and no other hybrid characteristic peaks are observed. As shown in Fig. S11,† the morphology of the catalyst after the reaction hardly changes significantly. However, long-term stability tests prove that the Ce(OH)3@NiFe LDH catalyst is stable, and the surface of the electrode is oxidized to form new catalytic species. It is important to note that because the hydroxyl oxides produced are small or amorphous, they are not observed in the XRD characterization in this work.

# Conclusion

In conclusion, NiFe LDH is reported as an example where Ce (Ce-NiFe LDH) is doped or the interface is constructed with Ce (OH)<sub>3</sub>(Ce(OH)<sub>3</sub>@NiFe LDH), and oxygen evolution and urea oxidation are used as probe reactions. The Ce(OH)3@NiFe LDH electrode displays superior electrocatalytic performance for the water oxidation reaction (at an overpotential of 220 mV(a)10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>) and urea oxidation reaction (at a potential of 1.40 V@10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>), which is one of the most superior electrochemical activities reported so far. It was found that the catalytic current had significant attenuation after a long time of durability testing, and further characterization showed that the surface of the electrode would be oxidized to oxyhydroxide, which is the true active species. The experimental results demonstrate that foreign Ce and Fe atom doping and interface construction promote the exposure of active centres, enhance the electron transfer rate and reduce the impedance of the NiFe LDH material. It is worth noting that it should be certainly useful for interface engineering and homogeneous atomic doping as a means for tuning the physiochemical proprieties of transition metal oxyhydroxides to improve their catalytic activity.

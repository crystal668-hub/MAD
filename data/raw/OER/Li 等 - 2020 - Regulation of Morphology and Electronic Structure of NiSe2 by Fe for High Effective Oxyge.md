#### **ABSTRACT**

With the development of hydrogen-energy economy, it is urgent for researchers to explore high effective non-noble metal electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Nickel-based selenides have good conductivity and easy to regulate, which make them to be a promising OER electrocatalysts. Hence, many researchers engineering the structure of Nickel-based selenides to further improve the OER performance. In this paper, NixFe1-xSe<sup>2</sup> porous-nano-microspheres with different ratio were synthesized. Results confirm that Fe not only affects the number of active sites in NiSe2, but also affects the intrinsic activity by forming lattice defects. Besides, introduction of Fe can change the redox ability of Ni cation and Se anion, thus reduce the average valence state of Ni cation in NiOOH. As a result, the current density of OER is improved remarkably. When the current density reaches 10 mA cm-2 , the overpotential is only 285 mV.

#### **1. INTRODUCTION**

In recent years, renewable clean energy become more and more important for the humans, such as solar, wind, wave energy and so on. However, the solar energy and other renewable energy sources do not have a continuous cycle life due to the characteristic of the day and night cycle, which would block the continuous power generation of the energy source [1-2]. It is a good idea to convert solar energy into hydrogen energy. In this regard, the electrolytic water equipment, a new energy technology, can be used for energy conversion, which is clean, efficient and recognized by all of us [3-5]. The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is the anode reaction in the electrolytic water equipment. However, the anodic reaction kinetic is slow due to the four electrons transformation. Hence, catalyst is needed to carry out the catalytic reaction. At present, noble metal Ru or Ir-based compounds are relatively efficient catalysts, but high cost and resource shortage limit their application. Therefore, development of efficient, cheap and stable OER electrocatalysts is critical to the energy storage and conversion. The transition metal-based compound is found to be a promising oxygen evolution electrocatalyst through the exploration of researchers in recent years [6].

Researchers have studied the activity, stability, and tolerance of the OER electrocatalyst in the alkaline medium in recent years [7]. The transition metal-based electrocatalysts such as Ni, Co, Fe, Mo, Cu, Mn, Zn, V, Ti and Ta were investigated, including metal selenides, nitrides, phosphides, sulfides, oxides, hydroxides, hydroxyl oxides, and so on. Different types of metal compounds show different properties. For example, metal oxides, hydroxides and hydroxyl oxides are relatively stable in alkaline media, while the conductivity is poor. In order to resolve these problems, researchers designed series of structures to modify the material, including the substrate

loading, defect engineering, construction of the heterojunction and so on. Interestingly, the above structure can be achieved to a large extent by the preparation of double-metal or multi-metal-based electrocatalysts replace single-metal-based electrocatalyst. Besides, this modification method is relatively simple and easy to regulate. For example, the conductivity of single metal hydroxide is poor, the researchers have developed layered double metal hydroxide (LDH) that change the local electronic structure of the body metal due to the influence of the electronic arrangement between the two metals. Indeed, the method can increase the conductivity of the single metal hydroxide [8]. Similarly, the bimetallic oxide and the bimetallic hydroxides also have been designed based the principle [9-10]. In addition, the design of the bimetallic alloy electrocatalysts can improve the durability and the stability of the electrocatalysts. For example, the porous Ni-Mo nanomicrospheres (Ni-Mo-MS/Cu) were prepared on the copper foil by a one-step electrodeposition method. At the same current density, the overpotential of Ni-Mo MS/Cu decreased 160 mV after doping of Mo. Compared to the single-deposited Ni-based electrocatalyst (Ni/Cu), doping of Mo element plays an important role in the improvement of the catalytic performance [11]. NiCoP with a three-dimensional structure was prepared by Yu through the method of electrodeposition, the OER activity of which was significantly higher than that of NiP and CoP [12]. The author attributed this excellent OER performance to the open structure, which is beneficial to exposing more active sites and facilitating the transfer of protons. It is confirmed that doping of Co results in the formation of the special structure though a serious of characterization. It is the key factor to the improved performance. In addition, Co can also affect the electronic structure of the Ni and thus affecting the chemical interaction of the active intermediate. In addition, for the transition metal-based compounds such as the transition metal-based phosphide, nitride and carbide, the adsorption energy of the oxygen-containing intermediate or water can be adjusted by constructing

of heterostructure [13]. In particular, the heterogeneous structure with both a low sub-family number and a high sub-family number of transition metal is a promising oxygen evolution electrocatalyst because of the 3d electron-complementary effect [14].

In general, for transition metal-based oxygen evolution electrocatalysts, the interaction between the metals can affect the structure, morphology and composition of the material. Indeed, the catalytic performance can be significantly affected by the slight change of the nanomaterial. Therefore, it is efficient to optimize the OER performance by heteroatom doping. Moreover, large number of study has shown that Fe doping can easily regulate the morphology and electronic structure of transition metal based OER electrocatalysts, especially Ni and Co based electrocatalysts. Trace Fe has a great influence on the morphology and catalytic activity. Hence, in this work, NiFe LDH with different ratio was synthesized by one-step hydrothermal method, and followed by transformed into Fe-doped NiSe<sup>2</sup> to explore the regulating mechanism of Fe on nickel-based selenide. The preparation process is shown in **Scheme1.** It was found that the morphology of the microspheres was transformed into porous microspheres after Fe doping. Therefore, the number of catalytic sites was increased. From the electronic structure, it was found that Fe doping could regulate the average valence state of Ni in NiOOH and improve the catalytic activity of Ni cations. In addition, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) shows that the doping of Fe can improve the conductivity of NiSe2, which further improve the OER performance. This study would deepen our understanding of the synergy effect in Nickel-iron compound for electrocatalytic reaction.

#### **2. EXPERIMENT SECTION**

#### **2.1 Preparation of Ni(OH)<sup>2</sup> nanosheet and NiFe LDH nanosheet with different ratio.**

NixFe1-x LDH nanosheet was prepared according to the previously reported method [15]. x = 1, 0.9, 0.8, 0.7, 0.6, 0.5. Specifically, (2, 1.8, 1.6, 1.4, 1.2, 1) mmol Ni(NO3)<sup>2</sup> 6H2O, (0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1) mmol Fe(NO3)<sup>3</sup> 9H2O, 10 mmol urea and 4 mmol NH4F were dissolved in 40 cm<sup>3</sup> water to form a uniform solution, respectively. Then the solution reacted at 120 ℃ for 6 h. After the reaction, the reactor was cooled at room temperature, the product were cleaned three times by water and ethanol, respectively. Finally, the product was dried in a vacuum box at 60 ℃ for 12 h. The method for Ni(OH)<sup>2</sup> is the same except that Fe(NO3)3·9H2O was not added.

## **2.2 Preparation of NiSe<sup>2</sup> nano-microspheres and NixFe1-xSe<sup>2</sup> porous nano-microspheres with different ratio.**

Firstly, 60 cm<sup>3</sup> aqueous solution was purged with N<sup>2</sup> flow for 30 minutes. Secondly, 2.0 mmol NaBH<sup>4</sup> and 1 mmol Se powder were dissolved in the aqueous solution followed by gentle stirring for several minutes to form a clear solution, respectively. Thirdly, 0.5 mmol NiFe LDH was dispersed into the above solution and ultrasonic for 5 min. Then, the mixture was put into a 100 cm<sup>3</sup> reactor and heated at 180 ℃ for 20 h. Finally, the obtained product was washed with

deionized water and ethanol for three times and then drying in a vacuum box. Notably, the whole process is in the atmosphere of N2. The preparation of NiSe<sup>2</sup> is same except that the precursors was Ni(OH)2. The reaction process is as follows [16]:

$$Ni(OH)_2 + 2Se + NaBH_4 = NiSe_2 + NaBO_2 + 3H_2$$

#### **2.3 Physical characterization**

Firstly, the phase and crystal structure of the synthesized material are determined by X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer, Cu Kα). The molecular structure of the material is analyzed by Raman scattering spectrum (Labram-010). Secondly, the morphology before and after regulation by Fe element are observed by scanning electron microscope (SEM, Hitachi, S-4800). Finally, the change of the valence state of the material is analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (ESCALAB 250Xi).

#### **2.4 Electrochemical Measurement**

The electrochemical measurements were carried out with a CHI 760D electrochemical workstation in a three-electrode system using glassy carbon electrode as the working electrode, carbon rod as the counter electrode and saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the reference electrode. All the potentials in this work are reported vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). For preparing the working electrodes, 4 mg electrocatalyst material was dispersed in a mixed solvent containing 0.475 cm<sup>3</sup> water and 0.475 cm<sup>3</sup> ethanol followed by ultrasound for 30 minutes. Then, 0.05 cm<sup>3</sup> 5wt% nafion solution was added to the above solution to form slurry. Finally, 0.01 cm<sup>3</sup> slurry was evenly coated on the glassy carbon electrode with a load of 0.2038 mg cm-2 . All the polarization curves were corrected by eliminating IR drop with respect to the ohmic resistance

of the solution. Polarization curves were obtained using LSV with a scan rate of 5 mV s-1 in 1 M KOH solution from 0 to 0.8 V. The electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) was evaluated using CV curves from 0.1 V to 0.2 V at 10, 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 mV s-1 , respectively. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was carried out at the overpotential of 285 mV.

#### **3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION**

#### **3.1 Physical characterization**

#### **3.1.1 Morphology analysis**

As shown in (**Figure 1**), (**A**) and (**B**) represent that Ni(OH)<sup>2</sup> with a diameter of about 10 μm and a thickness of about 40 nm was obtained, while NiFe LDH shows a diameter of about 5 μm and a thickness of about 10 nm, all of which are typical nano-microspheres, a three-dimensional structure assembled from nanosheets. The morphology could expose more active sites compared with ordinary structures such as nanowires and nanosheets. It is obvious that the diameter of NiFe LDH is reduced and the thickness is thinner than that of Ni(OH)2, which indicates that doping of Fe has an great influence on the morphology of Ni-based nanomaterials, which is consistent with the previous research results [17].

**Figure 2.** (A) and (B) SEM images of NiSe2; (C) and (D) SEM images of Ni0.9Fe0.1Se<sup>2</sup>

It can be found that the material after selenizing retains the morphology of the corresponding hydroxide, but Ni0.9Fe0.1Se<sup>2</sup> transformed into porous nano-microsphere (**Figure 2D**). The porous nano-microsphere is a tertiary structure assembled by nanosheets, which is formed by accumulating of nanoparticles. As a result, the specific surface area of Ni0.9Fe0.1Se<sup>2</sup> is significantly increased compared to NiSe2, which becomes an important factor to enhance the catalytic performance of OER.

EDS elemental mapping of Fe, Ni, and Se for Ni0.9Fe0.1Se<sup>2</sup> are shown in (**Figure S1**), which intuitively confirmed the doping of Fe element. Besides, we can find that the content of Fe is less than that of Ni. EDS spectra of Ni0.9Fe0.1Se<sup>2</sup> also confirmed the result that the content of Ni is approximately nine times of Fe in (**Table S1**), which is consistent with the theoretical result.

For further investigating the effect of doping concentration on the morphology of NiSe2, SEM images of different ratio of NixFe1xSe<sup>2</sup> are shown in (**Figure 3**). It can be found that compared with Ni0.9Fe0.1Se2, the number of pores on the surface of Ni0.8Fe0.2Se<sup>2</sup> nanosheet decreases significantly and only a small number of pores are distributed on the surface. Besides, the surface of the nanosheet becomes rough and a small number of nanoparticles are attached. When the content of Fe continued to increase, the distribution of pores could not be seen on the surface of Ni0.7Fe0.3Se2. Besides, the accumulation of nanoparticles was dense and the specific surface area of materials decreased. When the content of Fe reaches 40%, as shown in (**Figure 3E**), the number of nanoparticles loaded on the surface of nanosheets is significantly increased, which may be due to the destruction of the structure by doping of Fe with high content. It is no longer pure phase as the increase of the content of Fe. Combined with this paper and previous studies, the doping of Fe should be controlled at about 10% in order to increase the specific surface area of nickel-based selenides. Ratio resolved experiments revealed that the three-dimensional structure to a large extent related to the doping of Fe. The significant morphological changes were also found in other cationic or anionic doped materials. However, the mechanism about the morphological change of

the nanostructure with ion-doping was not clearly clarified, more systematic and detailed work was still required to make clear the growth mechanism [18].

#### **3.1.2 Structural analysis**

The phase composition is obtained by XRD. While the reaction in this work occurred in the atmosphere of N2, it is easily to be oxidized in the whole process. The oxidation reaction is as follows:

4 NaBH<sub>4</sub> + 2 Se + 7 H<sub>2</sub>O = 2 NaHSe + Na<sub>2</sub>B<sub>4</sub>O<sub>7</sub> + 14 H<sub>2</sub>
$$\uparrow$$
 (3-1);  
2 NaHSe + O<sub>2</sub> = 2 Se $\downarrow$ +2 NaOH (3-2);

Hence, there are additional peaks of Se (PDF#06-0362) in the XRD pattern of the NiSe2. The other XRD peak of NiSe<sup>2</sup> corresponds to the reference peak of NiSe2(PDF#41-1495), we have marked them by black asterisk (\*).We can find that the phase of Ni0.9Fe0.1Se<sup>2</sup> conforms to the pure crystal structure of NiSe<sup>2</sup> (PDF#41-1495), a typical cubic phase structure of pyrite [19]. However, different from the pure NiSe2, the peak intensity of Ni0.9Fe0.1Se<sup>2</sup> becomes weaker and the position moves to a high angle, which means the decrease of cell parameters. It is probably due to the smaller cell parameters of FeSe<sup>2</sup> (5.776 Å) than that of NiSe2(5.963 Å) [20-21].

In order to explore the effect of doping concentration on the structure of NiSe2, NixFe1-xSe<sup>2</sup> (x = 1, 0.9, 0.8, 0.7, 0.6, 0.5) were synthesized. As shown in (**Figure 4B**), there are changes about two aspects. Firstly, the intensity of diffraction peaks becomes weaker and weaker as the content of Fe increase gradually until the ratio of 40%. Secondly, a new phase structure appears and the intensity of diffraction peak becomes stronger and stronger with the increasing of content of Fe in the range of 40%-50%. The new signal peak belongs to the crystal plane of Ni3Se<sup>4</sup> (PDF#18-0890). When the ratio of Fe is more than 40%, it has been completely converted to Ni3Se4. We have marked them by blue asterisk (\*). In summary, properly doping of Fe (less than 10%) will not only maintain the phase of NiSe2, but also weaken the degree of crystallization, cause lattice distortion, produce lattice defects and increase the exposed active sites.

**Figure 4**. (A) XRD patterns of NiSe<sup>2</sup> and Ni0.9Fe0.1Se2; (B) XRD patterns of Ni0.9Fe0.1Se2, Ni0.8Fe0.2Se2, Ni0.7Fe0.3Se2, Ni0.6Fe0.4Se<sup>2</sup> and Ni0.5Fe0.5Se2.

The molecular structure of the electrocatalysts was be obtained by Raman. As shown in (**Figure 5**), there is no difference between the spectra of NiSe<sup>2</sup> and Ni0.9Fe0.1Se2. The peaks at 146.6, 166.59, 206.1 and 233.94 cm-1 belong to the Tg, Eg, Ag and Tg characteristic peaks of NiSe2, respectively [22]. In addition, there both exist a small peak at 478 cm-1 , which is analyzed to be the characteristic of (SeOx)2 group [23]. This indicates that nickel-based selenide are easy to be oxidized in air and moderate amount of Fe doping does not affect the molecular structure of NiSe2.

**Figure 5.** Raman patterns of NiSe<sup>2</sup> and Ni0.9Fe0.1Se<sup>2</sup>

#### **3.1.3 Valence state analysis**

The effect of Fe doping on the electronic structure of NiSe<sup>2</sup> is obtained by XPS. The XPS spectrum of Fe 2p in Ni0.9Fe0.1Se<sup>2</sup> is shown in (**Figure 6A**), where the bond energy at 706.18, 712.9 and 726.51 eV belong to the Fe2+ 2p3/2、Fe3+ 2p3/2 and Fe3+ 2p1/2 signal peaks, respectively [24]. Because the pure Fe2O<sup>3</sup> sample has two main peaks at 711 and 724 eV and two satellite characteristic peaks at 719 and 732 eV [25], while there are no satellite peaks in Ni0.9Fe0.1Se2. Hence, the Fe3+ in this sample is not caused by oxidation. As a result, the Fe element in

Ni<sub>0.9</sub>Fe<sub>0.1</sub>Se<sub>2</sub> has two valence states: Fe<sup>2+</sup> and Fe<sup>3+</sup>, which both exist as Se-Fe bond. It can be found that the bond energy of Ni 2p moves to the low wavenumber after Fe doping as shown in (**Figure 6C**), which shows that the introduction of Fe can adjust the redox ability of Ni and decrease the average valence state of Ni. The spectrum of Se 3d (**Figure 6D**)in NiSe<sub>2</sub> and Ni<sub>0.9</sub>Fe<sub>0.1</sub>Se<sub>2</sub> indicates the introduction of Fe also makes the bond energy of Se negative shift and the average valence state decreases, which intuitively proves the strong electron interaction between Fe, Ni and Se. The negative shift of bond energy of Se is caused by local electron transfer after Fe doping. As a result, the electron possession of Se increases and the ability of electron donating enhanced [12], which make it easier to be oxidized in alkaline solution. As a result, metal selenide materials are easier to form SeO<sub>x</sub> and metal hydroxide during the OER. The latter is the OER activity material, which would improve the OER performance. The reaction process is as follows [21]:

$$Ni_xFe_{1-x}Se_2 + (15-x)OH^- = Ni_xFe_{1-x}(OH)_{3-x} + 2SeO_3^{2-} + 6H_2O + (11-x)e^-$$
 (3-3)

$$Ni_xFe_{1-x}Se_2 + (19-x)OH^- = Ni_xFe_{1-x}(OH)_{3-x} + 2SeO_4^{2-} + 8H_2O + (15-x)e^-$$
 (3-4)

**Figure 7.** (A) and (B) The Ni 2p XPS spectrum of NiSe<sup>2</sup> and Ni0.9Fe0.1Se2; (C) and (D) The Se 3d XPS spectrum of NiSe<sup>2</sup> and Ni0.9Fe0.1Se<sup>2</sup>

The Ni 2p1/2 and Ni 2p3/2 peaks in NiSe<sup>2</sup> (**Figure 7A**) can be divided into two components. The fitting peaks of the bond energy at 852.89, 856.93 and 862.48 eV are 2p3/2 of the Ni2+, Ni3+ and satellite peak of Ni2+, respectively. In **Figure 7B**, the fitting peaks of Ni0.9Fe0.1Se<sup>2</sup> are at 853.05, 856.47 and 862.17 eV. Obviously, the bond energy of Ni3+ in Ni0.9Fe0.1Se<sup>2</sup> is 0.46 eV lower than that of NiSe2, which is because of the doping of Fe could inhibit the redox reaction between Ni2+ and Ni3+ [26]. (**Figure 7C**) and (**Figure 7D**) show the Se 3d peak fitting spectra of NiSe<sup>2</sup> and Ni0.9Fe0.1Se2, respectively. The peaks of NiSe<sup>2</sup> are at 54.68, 54.61 and 59.36 eV, which belong to Se2- 3d5/2、Se2- 3d3/2 and SeO2, respectively. And the fitting peaks of Ni0.9Fe0.1Se<sup>2</sup> are consistent with NiSe2, which indicates that Se exists in the form of Ni-Se, Fe-Se and selenium oxides.

#### **3.2 Electrochemical measurement**

The LSV curves of NiSe<sup>2</sup> and NixFe1-xSe<sup>2</sup> are shown in **Figure 8A**. The peak of 1.33-1.45 V belongs to the oxidation peak of Ni(OH)2/NiOOH, implying the electrochemical oxidation of Ni(OH)<sup>2</sup> to NiOOH. It can be seen intuitively that the overpotential is only 285 mV for NixFe1 <sup>x</sup>Se<sup>2</sup> when the current density reaches 10 mA cm-2 (**Figure 8A**), which is much lower than that of NiSe2. On one hand, the excellent catalytic performance is due to the increase of the active sites. On the other hand, the regulation of the electronic structure by Fe makes the electrocatalyst more conducive to the OER. (**Figure 8B**) and (**Figure 8C**) are the corresponding Tafel slope and electrochemical impedance spectra, which can be used to evaluate the catalytic kinetics for OER. The Tafel slope of NiSe<sup>2</sup> and NixFe1-xSe<sup>2</sup> is 125 and 90 mV dec-1 respectively. And the charge transfer resistance of NixFe1-xSe<sup>2</sup> is also much smaller than that of NiSe2. It is shown that doping

of Fe improves the conductivity of NiSe<sup>2</sup> [18], the electron transfer rate of modified NixFe1-xSe<sup>2</sup> is accelerated and the charge transfer resistance is also significantly reduced [27]. In addition, a simplified Randles equivalent circuit was used to fit the experimental results. The high frequency semicircle is caused by the charge transfer resistance on the opposite electrode-electrolyte interface (**Figure S3A** and **Figure S3C**) and low frequency semicircle is caused by the charge transfer resistance on the working electrode-electrolyte interface (**Figure S3B** and **Figure S3D**) [28]. By comparing the charge transfer resistance on the interface between working electrode and electrolyte in NiSe<sup>2</sup> (**Figure S3B**) and Ni0.9Fe0.1Se<sup>2</sup> (**Figure S3D**), the kinetics of catalytic reaction can be reflected intuitively. As shown in (**Figure 8D**), the area of the CV curve for Ni0.9Fe0.1Se<sup>2</sup> is smaller than that of NiSe2. Besides, compared to NiSe<sup>2</sup> (1.37 V vs. RHE), the oxidation peak of Ni2+ in Ni0.9Fe0.1Se<sup>2</sup> (1.4 V vs. RHE) moves towards the positive potential [29-30], which is because that the oxidation of Ni2+ is depressed by Fe3+ via the oxidation-reduction reaction. According to the researches, γ-NiOOH is thought to be the catalytic active center for Ni based OER electrocatalysts in the alkaline environment. In the catalytic process, Ni-based materials has a ripening process from α-Ni(OH)<sup>2</sup> to γ-NiOOH and the average valence state of Ni in γ-NiOOH is 3.7. Therefore, each Ni atom needs to transfer 1.7 electrons during the ripening process [30-32]. Moreover, some studies have shown that the kinetics in OER of the Ni4+ is very slow and the catalytic performance is poor, while the kinetics of the Fe4+ site in NiOOH structure in OER is faster [27]. Experiment results implied that Fe can inhibit the oxidation process from Ni2+ to Ni3+/4+ , reduce the average valence state of Ni in γ-NiOOH and increase the valence state of Fe according to the redox reaction between the Fe and Ni [33]. Therefore, the interaction between Fe and Ni promotes the OER performance.

**Figure 8.** (A) LSV curve of NiSe<sup>2</sup> and Ni0.9Fe0.1Se<sup>2</sup> with a scan rate of 5 mV s-1 ; (B) Tafel curve of NiSe<sup>2</sup> and Ni0.9Fe0.1Se2; (C) Nyquist curve of NiSe<sup>2</sup> and Ni0.9Fe0.1Se<sup>2</sup> at a overpotential of 285 mV; (D) CV curve of NiSe<sup>2</sup> and Ni0.9Fe0.1Se<sup>2</sup>

The specific surface area increases significantly after modification. In order to visually reflect the influence of the morphology on the performance, the OER activity was normalized by electrochemical active surface area. (**Figure S4A**) and (**Figure S4C**) are the CV tests performed at the sweep speed of 10, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100 mV s-1 for NiSe<sup>2</sup> and Ni0.9Fe0.1Se2, respectively. After fitting, the double-layer capacitance (Cdl) of NiSe<sup>2</sup> and Ni0.9Fe0.1Se<sup>2</sup> is calculated as 0.0658 mF cm-2 and 0.11485 mF cm-2 . The increased specific surface area could increase the contact area between the electrocatalysts and electrolyte. Hence, more catalytic reaction would occur on the interface.

LSV curves after normalization of the electrochemical active surface area is shown in (**Figure 9A**). It can be found that the difference of overpotential between Ni0.9Fe0.1Se<sup>2</sup> and NiSe<sup>2</sup> after normalization is obviously lower than that before normalization, which indicates the threedimensional porous nanosheet contributes a lot to the excellent catalytic activity. On one hand, the catalyst is in full contact with electrolyte and the number of water molecules involved in the reaction increases in the open structure. What is more, the porous structure provides a broader place for catalytic reaction. On the other hand, the exposed active centers also increase significantly because of the increasing specific surface area.

**Figure 9B** indicates the stability of Ni0.9Fe0.1Se<sup>2</sup> electrocatalysts. For preparing the working electrodes, 1 mg electrocatalyst material was dispersed in a mixed solvent containing 0.450 cm<sup>3</sup> water and 0.450 cm<sup>3</sup> ethanol followed by ultrasound for 30 minutes. Then, 0.1 cm<sup>3</sup> 5wt% nafion solution was added to the above solution to form slurry. Finally, the slurry was evenly coated on the CFP (1cm×1cm) with a load of 1mg cm-2 . A polarization curve of OER before and after the cyclic CVs from 0.25V to 0.45V at a sweep rate of 5mV s -1 for 1000 cycles was obtained. We can find that the Ni0.9Fe0.1Se<sup>2</sup> electrocatalysts have no degradation after 1000 CV cycles, which indicates that the Ni0.9Fe0.1Se<sup>2</sup> electrocatalysts have very good stability in 1 M KOH medium.

**Figure 9.** (A) LSV curve of NiSe<sup>2</sup> and Ni0.9Fe0.1Se<sup>2</sup> after normalization by electrochemical active surface area. (B) Stability test of Ni0.9Fe0.1Se<sup>2</sup>

We also investigate the OER activity of NixFe1-xSe<sup>2</sup> with various ratio of Fe. There are slightly changes in OER activity at current density of 10 mA cm-2 (**Figure S5**), which is consistent with the previous report [34].

#### **4. CONCLUSION**

In this work, Fe-doped NiSe<sup>2</sup> was synthesized by LDH conversion to explore the effect of Fe doping on the morphology, electronic structure and catalytic performance of nickel-based selenides. Through SEM, XRD, Raman, XPS and other characterization analysis, we draw the following conclusions: Fe can adjust the morphology of nickel-based selenide and transform it into a structure with large specific surface area, which not only provide a greater space to reaction, but also exposes more active centers. Besides, doping of Fe can improve the conductivity of nickelbased selenides by forming lattice defects and accelerate the transfer of electrons. More importantly, Fe can inhibit the oxidation from Ni2+ to Ni3+/4+, reduce the average valence state of Ni in γ-NiOOH, accelerate the kinetics in OER and improve the catalytic performance. This study would deepen our understanding of the synergy effect in Nickel-iron compound for electrocatalytic reaction.

# 1 | INTRODUCTION

With the pressing need for reproducible energy systems, a great many trials have been committed to exploring low-cost, eco-friendly, and greater theoretical efficiency energy devices, such as metal-air batteries1-5 and fuel cells.6-11 The efficient electrocatalysts play a critical role in the process of ORR and OER,12-15 which have been considered as a critical factor in its widespread application. It is generally accepted that the precious-metalsbased electrocatalysts possess the most efficient catalytic activity for the limited kinetics of the reversible oxygen electrodes. Whereas, the high cost and destitute durability motivate us to develop earth-abundant materials with a comparable electrochemical performance for ORR and OER.

Optimizing precious-metal free electrocatalysts have been intensively studied in recent years.16-19 Above all the nonprecious metal electrocatalysts, the transition metal-nitrogen-carbon offers exciting opportunities, which has garnered much attention due to its outstanding activity with low cost and superior electrochemical durability.20,21 Jia et al developed a formamide-derived cobalt/nitrogen co-doped ultrathin carbon by a pyrolysisfree strategy,<sup>22</sup> which exhibited atomically dispersed cobalt feature and showed attractive ORR/OER and Znair battery performances. Zhang et al obtained metalorganic frameworks (MOFs)-derived carbon with transition-metal (Co, Zn, Fe, and Cu) mixed,<sup>23</sup> which showed progressed ORR and Zn-air battery benefiting from its large surface area, conductive carbon frameworks, and widely-spread multimetal active sites. However, the limited channel for charge transmission and mass transfer of micropore-dominant transition metalnitrogen-carbon is an important issue for practical application. In response to this phenomenon, mesopore and macropore traits could offer high effective surface area for electrochemistry reaction, full exposure to potential active site, effective channel for electronic transmission, and short diffusion separation for oxygen.24,25

Zhao et al prepared hollow nanospheres with cobalt nanoparticles by pyrolysis of yolk-shell nanostructured Co-Zn-MOFs@polydopamine to impede the aggregation of Co nanoparticles and built hierarchical porous structure,<sup>26</sup> the as-synthesized electrocatalysts showed that small Co nanoparticles (ca. 10 nm in size) was uniformly distributed in the shell and displayed intensified ORR/OER performance. Tang et al reported a novel strategy to direct use the intrinsic structural defects via defect engineering in hierarchical porous graphene with atomically Co-Nx-C active sites.<sup>27</sup> The Co/N/O co-doped electrocatalysts exhibited superior ORR/OER bifunctional activities and robust Zn-air batteries performance. In consequence, transition metal-based hierarchical porous carbon makes it a promising nonprecious metal bifunctional oxygen catalyst alternative.

Herein, we elaborate a novel and facile synthesis of three-dimensional Co/N doped ordered macro/mesoporous carbon bifunctional oxygen catalyst by evaporating ethanol of mixture solution of F127 (soft template), dicyandiamide, cobalt nitrate hexahydrate, and resol in the gap of ordered PMMA nanosphere (hard template), followed by pyrolysis treatment to remove soft and hard templates. The three-dimensional, hierarchically porous electrocatalyst with progressed mass/electron transfer displayed superior electrocatalytic performance toward both ORR and OER under alkaline media. As expected, the as-prepared Zn-air battery showed high peak power density and robust discharge performance. The present work provided a simple but cost-efficient method for designing and preparing nonprecious metal catalyst with a three-dimensional ordered hierarchical pore structure for multiscale mass transfer as well as energy storage.

# 2.1 | Synthesis of ordered mesoporous carbon

Typically, 1.0 g F127, 1.0 g dicyandiamide, and 0.2 g cobalt nitrate hexahydrate were dissolved at 40C in 5.0 g isopropanol, 14.0 g ethanol, and 3.0 g deionized water, and 1.0 g ethanol, respectively. Then the mixture was blended under stirring for 30 minutes, and 5.0 g 20 wt% resol solution obtained through the polymerization of phenol as well as formaldehyde was added to the above mixture solution. After vigorous stirring, the product was transferred to a dish to evaporate solvent overnight, followed by thermal polymerization under 100C for at least 24 hours. The obtained thin film was pyrolyzed in a nitrogen condition under 350C for 2 hours and 900C for 3 hours. The as-synthesized sample was denoted as Co-N-OMC. N-OMC (N-doped ordered mesoporous carbon) was synthesized through the same method, except without adding cobalt nitrate hexahydrate. The ordered mesoporous carbon was also synthesized, which was denoted as OMC.

# 2.2 | Synthesis of 3D ordered macro/ mesoporous carbon

PMMA nanosphere was prepared through a modified emulsifier-free emulsion polymerization and horizontal deposition procedure.<sup>28</sup> 3D ordered macro/mesoporous carbon was obtained using a vacuum-assisted impregnation method. Typically, F127, dicyandiamide, cobalt nitrate hexahydrate, and resol was mixed similar to the procedure of Co-N-OMC. PMMA template was impregnated in the above mixture solution for 1 hour under vacuum. After removing the redundant solution, the mixture was transferred to a dish to evaporate solvent overnight, followed by thermal polymerization at 100C for at least 24 hours. The obtained thin film was pyrolyzed under a nitrogen condition at 350C for 2 hours and 900C for 3 hours. The obtained sample was denoted as Co-N-3DOM/mC.

# 2.3 | Material characterizations

X-ray diffraction patterns were obtained on a Rotation Anode High Power. Scanning electron microscopy patterns were collected on Zeiss Ultra Plus. Transmission electron microscopy were performed with a JEOL JEM-2100F microscope. Nitrogen adsorption-desorption test was collected by a Micromeritics Tristar II 3020 analyzer. X-ray photoelectron spectra patterns were performed with a VG ESCALAB 250Xi X-ray photoelectron spectrometer. The Raman patterns were carried out with a Raman spectroscopy (inVia, Renishaw, China).

### 2.4 | Electrochemical measurement

The ORR and OER tests were obtained on a CHI 660E electrochemical workstation. The synthesized non-precious electrocatalysts and commercial Pt/C inks were prepared through utilizing 5 mg catalyst powder with a mixed solution of 20  $\mu$ L Nafion solution (5%), 100  $\mu$ L of deionized water, and 900  $\mu$ L of isopropanol.

The stability of the electrocatalyst was investigated by a chronoamperometric response with a constant potential  $(0.6~\rm V)$  under  $1600~\rm rpm$ . The CH<sub>3</sub>OH  $(3~\rm M)$  tolerance measurements were evaluated at  $1600~\rm rpm$  during a constant potential  $(0.6~\rm V)$ .

To obtain the electron transfer number during ORR process, the Koutecky-Levich (K-L) equation is given:

$$\frac{1}{J} = \frac{1}{J_{L}} + \frac{1}{J_{L}} = \frac{1}{R\omega_{L}^{1}} + \frac{1}{J_{L}} \tag{1}$$

$$B = 0.2nFC_0D_0^{2/3}\nu^{-1/6}$$
 (2)

where J is the measured current density,  $J_{\rm L}$  and  $J_{\rm k}$  are the kinetic and limiting current densities, respectively,  $\omega$  is the rotating rate, n is the electron transfer number, F is the Faraday constant,  $C_0$  is the bulk concentration of  $O_2$ ,  $D_0$  is the diffusion coefficient of  $O_2$ ,  $\nu$  is the kinematic viscosity of the electrolyte.

The LSV patterns for OER were carried out under 0.1 M KOH electrolyte with a scan rate of 5.0 mV/s.

The catalysts of Co-N-3DOM/mC and Pt/C were investigated as air cathodes on a Zn-air battery (zinc foil was used as the anode). The electrocatalyst ink was prepared as aforementioned, and the catalyst was coated on a carbon paper (loading of 1.0 mg/cm<sup>2</sup>). All the tests were performed with a CHI 660E electrochemical workstation.

#### 3 | RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

### 3.1 | Characterization of the catalysts

The Co/N-codoped three-dimensional hierarchically ordered macro/mesoporous carbon is prepared by a three-step procedure as schematically depicted in Figure 1. First, the highly ordered PMMA (hard template) prepared by horizontal deposition was impregnated in

the mixture of F127 (soft template), dicyandiamide, cobalt nitrate hexahydrate, and resol solution under vacuum, secondly removing redundant solution then transferring the mixture to a dish to evaporate solvent and thermopolymerization, followed by subsequent pyrolysis treatment to remove soft and hard templates, simultaneously.

The crystal structures of the as-prepared carbon-based electrocatalysts were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD). Wide-angle XRD patterns (Figure 2A) showed graphitic carbon of all as-synthesized samples. In the XRD patterns of Co-N-OMC and Co-N-3DOM/mC, the two diffraction peaks located at 44 and 52° are assigned to the (111) and (200) reflections of elemental cobalt, suggesting cobalt nitrate hexahydrate had been partly reduced to metallic cobalt through the carbon thermal reduction process. While small-angle XRD patterns (Figure 2B) of as-prepared electrocatalysts showed a mainly well-shaped peak at  $20 \approx 1^\circ$ , suggesting their ordered mesopore structure.  $^{29\text{-}31}$ 

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) are effective techniques to characterize the pore structure. The SEM pattern of highly ordered PMMA nanospheres prepared by emulsifier-free emulsion polymerization and horizontal deposition procedure was displayed in Figure 3A. As expected, Co-N-3DOM/mC showed the well-defined 3D ordered macroporous and mesoporous pore structure (Figure 3B, C, D), the ordered mesoporous pore structure was corroborated well with the small-angle XRD results. The pore sizes of macropore and mesopore were approximately 200 and 3 nm, respectively. The hierarchically and interconnected pore structure could provide more specific surface area for active sites and progressed transfer for reactants/products. 32,33 Figure S1 showed the small-size Co nanoparticle with lattice fringes of 0.204 nm, corresponding to the (111) plane of metallic cobalt nanoparticles.

The structure and porosity of as-prepared carbon-based electrocatalysts were investigated through nitrogen adsorption-desorption measurements (Figure 4A). The fast increase at the low-pressure region suggested the existence of micropores, which was originate from the precursor of resol and the dehydration and dehydrogenation of organic species under pyrolysis process. 34,35 The All the electrocatalysts showed typical Type-IV isotherms, indicating the unique adsorption behavior of mesoporous structure. As expected, the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) pore size distributions (Figure 4B) were centered around 3.0 nm, and structural parameters (Table S1) displayed the specific surface area and pore volume were increased from Co-N-OMC to Co-N-3DOM/mC. Combing with electron microscope images, the

FIGURE 1 Schematic diagram of the synthesis of hierarchically porous Co-N-3DOM/mC [Colour figure can be viewed at [wileyonlinelibrary.com](http://wileyonlinelibrary.com)]

carbon-based material with hierarchical micro-mesomacro porosity was obtain. It is generally agreed that unique hierarchically porosity with large surface area could improve multiscale mass and electron transfer as well as enhanced accessibility of active site, which contributed to the electrocatalytic reaction process.37,38

The surface chemical composition and valence states in carbon-based materials were subjected to X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Figure 5A and Table S2 exhibited that as-prepared catalysts mainly consisted of C, O, N, and Co. Nitrogen-doped acts a pivotal part in the electrocatalytic activity, which had been studied by numerous researchers.39,40 The high-resolution N 1s spectrum of N-OMC, Co-N-OMC, and Co-N-3DOM/mC (Figure 5B) could be fitted by four peaks corresponding to graphitic-N, pyrrolic-N, pyridinic-N, and pyridinic-N- oxide.41-43 The high content of graphitic-N and pyridinic-N of Co-N-OMC and Co-N-3DOM/mC enhanced the catalytic performance. The XPS results showed the Co contents of Co-N-OMC and Co-N-3DM/ mC were 0.82% and 0.65%, respectively. The result suggested the ordered macropores with higher specific surface area could restrict the nanoparticle aggregation, leading to the relatively less content of metal species.<sup>44</sup> The patterns of Co 2p spectrum (Figure 5C) from Co-N-OMC and Co-N-3DOM/mC displayed two pairs of spinorbit doublets, the peaks at 779.9 and 795.2 eV was assigned to Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2 corresponding to zero valence state of metallic Co species, while the peaks at 781.1 and 796.8 eV corresponding to cobalt in oxidized states possibly through the Co-N coordination. The results suggested the metallic cobalt combined with

N-coordinated cobalt species generate the electrochemical active sites.23,45,46 Raman spectra is a kind of solid method in order to identify carbon phases. Figure 5D exhibited two peaks of 1338 cm <sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> (D-band) and 1590 cm <sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> (G-band), suggesting the existence of disordered sp<sup>3</sup> and graphite sp<sup>2</sup> carbon.<sup>47</sup> It is considered that the

graphitization degree of as-prepared electrocatalysts could be evaluated through ID/IG, and a high degree of graphitization results in progressed conductivity and enhanced electrocatalytic activity.48,49 The values of ID/IG displayed the doped of N and Co could increase the graphitization degree of catalysts.

# 3.2 | ORR tests

To evaluate ORR activity for all carbon-based electrocatalysts and Pt/C, cyclic voltammetry (CV) test (Figure S2) was first performed in both N2- and O2 saturated electrolyte. Compared with no obvious redox peak under the N2-saturated 0.1 M KOH, the oxygen reduction peaks emerged under the O2-saturated solution exhibited their ORR performance. The ORR performances were further evaluated through linear sweep voltammetry (LSV). The ORR activity is evaluated by onset potential (Eonset) and half-wave potential (E1/2). As shown in Figure 6A, OMC and N-OMC exhibited limited activities at 1600 rpm, while Co-N-3DOM/mC displayed high ORR performance (Eonset = 0.95 V, E1/2 = 0.85 V), outperformed Co-N-OMC (Eonset = 0.92 V, E1/2 = 0.80 V) and many reported nonprecious catalysts,50-53 as reviewed through the recent work (Table S3), even outperformed Pt/C (Eonset = 0.95 V, E1/2 = 0.83 V). The resulting Co-N-3DOM/mC presented a greater kinetic current density (Jk) at 0.8 V (11.44 mA/cm2 ) and smaller Tafel slope (70.5 mV/dec) compared with that of 20 wt% Pt/C (Jk of 5.98 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> and Tafel slope of 82.2 mV/dec, respectively) and other carbon-based catalysts (Figure S3, Figure 6B), suggesting that Co-N-3DOM/mC possesses more efficient ORR kinetics process.

To better evaluate the ORR performance of Co-N-3DOM/mC, LSV measurements (Figure 6C) were collected under various rotating rates, the current density of Co-N-3DOM/mC increased due to the fast diffusion speed. The Koutecky-Levich (K-L) plots (Figure 6D) exhibited that Co-N-3DOM/mC followed the first-order reaction kinetics under the tested potential. The calculated electron transfer numbers for Co-N-3DOM/mC were 3.93-3.99, which were approached to that of Pt/C electrocatalyst,54 demonstrating that the ORR with Co-N-3DOM/mC catalyzed was a quasi-four-electron process. Apart from the activity, long-term stability is another essential factor to assess an attractive electrocatalyst. The stabilities of Co-N-3DOM/mC and commercial Pt/C were evaluated under 50 000 s chronoamperometric response in alkaline electrolyte. Figure 6E exhibited that commercial Pt/C showed 24.9% decrease of current density after 50 000 s operation at 0.6 V, while Co-N-3DOM/mC exhibited only 16.4% loss of current density after 80 000 s operation, it is clearly suggested that Co-N-3DOM/mC was more stable than Pt/C under 0.1 M KOH. Furthermore, the chemical state of Co-N-3DOM/mC remains almost the same curve after long-term ORR durability test (Figure S4), suggesting the robust stability of Co-N-C sites for practical application. As we all know, the possible methanol crossover induces the poisoning of the electrocatalyst in the cathode, the methanol-crossover effect of Co-N-3DOM/mC and 20 wt% Pt/C was further evaluated. As illustrated in Figure 6F, Co-N-3DOM/mC showed a negligible change in comparison with Pt/C after the introduction of the condition of 3.0 M methanol. It can be concluded that Co-N-3DOM/mC has better immunity toward methanol crossover, and make it a progressed electrocatalyst for direct methanol fuel cells.

# 3.3 | OER tests

The OER activities of as-acquired carbon-based electrocatalysts and commercial Pt/C were studied through LSV under 0.1 M KOH. As depicted in Figure 7A, OER performance was investigated through the operating voltage related to the current density of 10 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> (Ej = 10). Co-N-3DOM/mC exhibited the current density of 10 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> at 1.67 V, smaller than other as-synthesized electrocatalysts and 20 wt% Pt/C, even comparable with RuO2 catalyst,55,56 suggesting a superior catalytic OER performance of Co-N-3DOM/mC. The resulting Co-N-3DOM/mC presented a smaller Tafel slope (139.0 mV/ dec) in 0.1 M KOH, outperformed that of 20 wt% Pt/C (201.4 mV/dec) and other carbon-based catalysts (Figure S5), indicating that Co-N-3DOM/mC possesses intensified OER kinetics process. The overall oxygen electrocatalytic activity of catalyst for reversible oxygen reduction and evolution was investigated by the voltage gap (ΔE) between E1/2 for ORR and Ej = 10 for OER (ΔE=Ej = 10 − E1/2).<sup>57</sup> As shown in Figure 7B, Co-N-3DOM/mC showed the lowest ΔE of 0.82 V, demonstrating that Co-N-3DOM/mC was a promising alternative for bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst.

# 3.4 | Zn-air tests

To this end, the Zn-air batteries device were fabricated by utilizing Co-N-3DOM/mC and 20 wt% Pt/C as cathodes, while zinc foil as an anode (Figure 8A). As depicted in Figure S6, the Co-N-3DOM/mC based Zn-air battery displayed an open-circuit voltage of 1.49 V, which was higher than that of 20 wt% Pt/C (1.47 V). The polarization curves and power density patterns of Zn-air battery prepared from Co-N-3DOM/mC exhibited an enhanced

charge and discharge performance (Figure 8B) and high peak power density of 146 mW/cm<sup>2</sup> (Figure 8C), exceeding the Zn-air battery assembled from Pt/C (130 mW/cm<sup>2</sup> ) and most Zn-air batteries fabricated by carbon-based cathodes.58-60 Moreover, Zn-air battery assembled from Co-N-3DOM/mC exhibited attractive MENG ET AL. 6259

rechargeability under the charge/discharge cycles for 40 000 s (Figure S7). Figure 8D showed the discharge performance at 5 and 20 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> , and Co-N-3DOM/mC based Zn-air battery displayed a stable and relative high discharge output (1.35 and 1.26 V at 5 and 20 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> , respectively) compared with that of Pt/C based Zn-air battery (1.33 and 1.23 V at 5 and 20 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> , respectively).

# 4 | CONCLUSIONS

In summary, Co-N-doped 3D ordered macro/mesoporous carbon was successfully synthesized in the present work through an environment-friendly and low-cost preparation process. The precursor was prepared by utilizing resol as carbon source, dicyandiamide as nitrogen source, cobalt nitrate hexahydrate as metal source, F127 as soft template, and PMMA as hard template through evaporation-induced self-assembly and vacuum-assisted impregnation method. The as-obtained high specific surface area with the 3D hierarchical porous architecture of Co-N-doped ordered macro/mesoporous carbon showed outstanding electrocatalytic performance for ORR, OER, and Zn-air battery, which attribute to the improved multiscale mass and charge transfer as well as abundant active site exposure. This work may offer an ingenious standpoint for the design and synthesis of hierarchical nanostructured bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst for energy systems.

Developing effective electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is crucial for exploring clean fuels. Owing to the flexible structure and unique 3d electron structure, perovskite has been considered as a promising candidate for OER electrocatalyst. Here, we report a range of A-site partially substituted perovskite obtained via a facile sol-gel method, La $_{2-x}$ Sr $_x$ CoMnO $_6$  (x=0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1.0, LSCMO-x). LSCMO-x has been proved to have better OER performances. Therein, LSCMO-0.8 shows the best OER catalytic performance among these A-site partially substituted perovskites. The OER overpotential of

LSCMO-0.8 catalyst is 0.39 V, which is reduced by 80 mV compared to parent perovskite  $La_2CoMnO_6$  (LCMO, 0.47 V). The experimental studies have shown that LSCMO-0.8 exhibits a higher content of oxygen vacancies compared with LCMO, which may be the factor for the enhanced OER activity. Meanwhile, it is revealed that Sr doped in the A site can efficiently optimize the  $e_g$  orbit filling. This work manifests that doping Sr into perovskites appropriately is an effective strategy for the improvement of OER activity.

### Introduction

With petroleum energy gradually running out and the accompanying environmental problems, it has become a focus issue to explore effective technologies for clean energy exploitation and storage.[1-2] Up to now, solar and wind energy are considered potential candidates to satisfy the majority needs of global energy. Nevertheless, these energies are locked into the discontinuity and the requirement of economical and efficient storage solutions.[3] Among a variety of storage solutions, based on the ability of sustainable production of hydrogen, the reaction of water splitting  $(2H_2O \rightarrow O_2 + 2H_2)$  has been regarded as a desirable energy carrier.[3-5] It includes two half-reactions during the water-splitting process, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER,  $2H_2O \rightarrow O_2 + 4H^+ +$ 4e<sup>-</sup>) and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER,  $2H^+ + 2e^- \rightarrow H_2$ ). However, so far as the most available catalysts, it is kinetically sluggish for both reactions. Before reaching a useful stage, there is an overpotential  $(\eta)$  need to overcome. Remarkably, the four electron-transfer in OER lead to a larger overpotential than that in HER. Generally speaking, OER is regarded as the bottleneck of water splitting.  $^{\rm [6-7]}$ 

Due to the favorable OER activity, ruthenium and iridium oxide (RuO<sub>2</sub> and IrO<sub>2</sub>) have been regarded as mature electrocatalysts. Nevertheless, on account of the scarce crisis, it is urgent to explore efficient and cost-effective OER catalysts for a large-scale commercial application.[8] Perovskite transition metal (TM) oxides with a general ABO<sub>3</sub> formula, therein the A site consists of alkaline and/or rare-earth cations and TM at the B site, leading to unique 3d electronic structure and structure flexibility. They are promising precious-metal-free electrocatalysts in accelerating the OER process due to the exciting catalytic activity and stability in alkaline solutions. [9-17] Previous researchers have pointed out that the filling of e<sub>a</sub> orbitals of TM ions can effectively affect the OER activity.<sup>[18–19]</sup> The  $e_{\alpha}$  orbitals can connect with surface anion adsorbate and participate in the  $\sigma$ -bonding, which will have a tremendous impact on the oxygen-related intermediate species, then make a contribution to the improvement of OER performance. Regulating electron filling state of the metal in B-site moves toward unity, the perovskites would exhibit the best OER catalytic activity. [13] Based on this principle, various methods have been adopted to optimize the e<sub>a</sub> electron filling state, for example, by doping and introducing defects into the structure, and finally achieved outstanding OER catalytic activity. [13,20-24] Besides, oxygen vacancies usually play an important part in OER performance, which have a connection with the electronic structure and valence state of TM at B-site. [25] Generally, introducing A-site partially substituted ions or replacing TM ions with higher valance elements at B-site will lead to oxygen vacancies. [22] Recently, aliovalent Sr<sup>2+</sup> cations have been used to substitute La<sup>3+</sup> in LaMO<sub>3</sub> (M=Co, Fe, Ni, Mn), obtaining efficient OER catalysts such as La<sub>1-x</sub>Sr<sub>x</sub>CoO<sub>3-δ</sub>, [26-28]  $La_{1-x}Sr_xFeO_{3-\delta r}^{[29]} La_{1-x}Sr_xNiO_{3-\delta r}^{[30]}$  and  $La_{1-x}Sr_xMnO_{3-\delta r}^{[31]}$  The doping of  $Sr^{2+}$  in LaMO<sub>3- $\delta$ </sub> (M=Co, Mn) leads to change in the  $Co^{3+}/Co^{2+}$ or Mn<sup>3+</sup>/Mn<sup>4+</sup> molar ratio of the parent perovskite oxide and induces a rise in oxygen vacancy density, finally active the OER

performances.[32] In Sr<sup>2+</sup> doped perovskite La<sub>2-x</sub>Sr<sub>x</sub>NiMnO<sub>6</sub>, the optimized electronic structures reduce the charge transfer barrier between Ni/Mn 3d and O 2p, further improving the OER activities.[33]

Among various perovskite oxides, multifunctional double perovskite La<sub>2</sub>CoMnO<sub>6</sub> (LCMO) has attracted remarkable scientific attention owing to its rich physics and prospects for technological applications.[34-36] However, when used as a catalyst, LCMO exhibits insufficient OER activities in alkaline solution. Here, we report the electrocatalytic activities of A-site partially substituted  $La_{2x}Sr_xCoMnO_6$  (x=0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1.0, LSCMO-x) samples as OER electrocatalysis. The results manifest that LSCMO-0.8 possesses the best OER activity among these A-site partially substituted LSCMO-x perovskites. The improved OER performances could be ascribed to optimized e<sub>a</sub> occupancy at B-site element accompanied with the abundant oxygen vacancies.

## **Results and Discussion**

A series of LSCMO-x catalysts have been obtained through a simple sol-gel method. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the synthesized LSCMO-x are shown in Figure 1a. It is observed that pure phase formation is available for the as-prepared LSCMO-x. LSCMO-x belong to a pure monoclinic structure with space group of P2<sub>1</sub>/n according to the Rietveld analysis of XRD patterns (Figure 1b, c and S1). For monoclinic  $P2_1/n$  structure, MnO<sub>6</sub> and CoO<sub>6</sub> octahedra are corner-shared in the unit cell (inset of Figure 1b, c). Table S1 summarized the lattice parameters based on the XRD refinement results, which decreased with the increase of Sr-dopped contents. The reduction of lattice parameters is probably due to the content of higher oxidization states of Co3+ increased by substitution of Sr2+ for La3+.[33]

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurements have been conducted to analyze the morphologies of the samples. The SEM images of the perovskite catalysts are represented in Figure 2 and S2. It is demonstrated that all the catalysts have similar morphologies due to the optimized synthesis procedure, and

most of the particle sizes range around 50-100 nm. The particle sizes decrease with the Sr doping levels can be seen from the images, which probably due to the modification of crystal nucleation and growth behaviors.[37] The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method was conducted to examine the specific surface area of LSCMO-x samples. The BET surface areas of LSCMO-x are 1.0274, 2.2723, 3.7560, 2.8926, 11.9990, and 6.6950  $m^2 \cdot q^{-1}$ , respectively (Figure S4). Moreover, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) was conducted to explore the crystal qualities and lattice structures of LSCMO-x (Figure 2 and S3). The lattice plane analysis of LSCMO-0.8 displays the d-spacing of 0.2158 and 0.2672 nm, which are in agreement with the (202) and (020) planes. On the whole, LSCMO-x samples show similar morphologies with diverse particle sizes, which may have an influence on surface areas associated with the OER performances.

The OER performance of LSCMO-x perovskite samples was evaluated in 1.0 M KOH with saturated O2. As shown in Figure 3a, linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves of LSCMO-x displayed a smaller onset potential at 1 mA·cm<sup>2</sup> (about 1.50 V), indicating a higher OER catalytic current and better OER catalytic performances. Normally, an important criterion to evaluate the effectiveness of OER catalysts is the overpotential  $(\eta)$  at 10 mA·cm<sup>2</sup>. LSCMO-0.8 shows the smallest overpotential of 0.39 V, which is lower than that of LSCMO-0.2 (0.46 V), LSCMO-0.4 (0.44 V), LSCMO-0.6 (0.40 V) and LSCMO-1.0 (0.44 V), especially about 80 mV lower than that of LCMO (0.47 V). The results imply that LSCMO-0.8 has the best OER activity among these LSCMO-x compounds. Moreover, the activity of LSCMO-0.8 is comparable to some reported materials such as  $SrNb_{0.1}Co_{0.7}Fe_{0.2}O_{3.\delta}$  nanorods  $(\eta = 0.39 \text{ V})$ , [38]  $LaCo_{0.8}Fe_{0.2}O_3$   $(\eta =$ 0.39 V), and  $Sr_{0.9}Co_{0.8}Fe_{0.2}O_{3-\delta}$  ( $\eta = 0.39 \text{ V}$ ). The Tafel slope derived from the LSV curves is illustrated in Figure 3b. As can be seen, the Tafel slopes of LSCMO-0.8 is 54.6 mV·dev<sup>-1</sup>, lower than those of other species (64.4-75.7 mV·dev<sup>-1</sup>), further implying the faster reaction kinetics. The electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) as an essential role in the electrocatalytic activity, is related to the double-layer capacitance ( $C_{\rm dl}$ ). The  $C_{\rm dl}$ can be calculated through cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves at different rates (Figure S5). As displayed in Figure 3c, LSCMO-0.8 gives the most considerable  $C_{dl}$  value (3.04 mF·cm<sup>-2</sup>), while LCMO has the lowest value (0.22 mF·cm<sup>-2</sup>), indicating the different active area of LSCMO-x. The BET surface area trend is in accordance with this ECSA trend (Figure S4). In order to eliminate the surface area effect from the OER activity, the BET surface area of the samples was normalized against the OER current density. At 1.60 V, LCMO and LSCMO-x showed a specific current density of  $0.0881 \, \text{mA cm}_{\text{oxide}}^{-2}$  $0.0377 \text{ mA cm}_{\text{oxide}}^{-2}$ ,  $0.0704 \text{ mA cm}_{\text{oxide}}^{-2}$ ,  $0.2394 \text{ mA cm}_{\text{oxide}}^{-2}$ ,  $0.0977 \text{ mA cm}_{\text{oxide}}^{-2}$ ,  $0.3494 \text{ mA cm}_{\text{oxide}}^{-2}$ , respectively. This normalized trend mismatch with the ECSA trend, indicating that

the ECSA is the key factor behind the superior OER performance of LSCMO-0.8.  $^{[48]}$ 

The mass activity of LSCMO-x at different potentials is shown in Figure 3d. The mass activity of LSCMO-0.8 was nearly 5 times than that of LCMO at 1.70 V, markedly exceeding that of the parent perovskite oxide. Besides, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis was performed to access the charge transfer resistance for the OER performance. As illustrated in Figure S6, the charge transfer resistance of LSCMO-0.8 was the smallest among these compounds, demonstrating that LSCMO-0.8 owned the most efficient charge transfer rates for OER electrocatalysis. Therefore, it can be concluded that the introduction of A-site partially substitution in LCMO perovskite can enhance the OER catalytic performance.

Another critical factor in determining the practicality of the electrocatalysts is the long-term stability test. Thus, continuous cycles were performed to assess the stability behavior of LSCMO-x samples between potential 1.12 and 1.72 V (vs. RHE). After 1000 cycles, the OER activity of LSCMO-x catalysts slightly declined compared with LCMO at the current density of 10 mA·cm², indicating the excellent durability of the LSCMO-x perovskite (Figure 4). The excellent durability probably arose from the continuous generation and detachment of bubbles and inevitably surface reconstruction. These results demonstrated that compared to the bulk LCMO, the A-site partially substituted perovskites of LSCMO-x have better OER activity, particularly LSCMO-0.8 presents the highest catalytic activity.

Herein, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) has been conducted to gain more information about the oxidation state and chemical composition of the products. As shown in Figure 5, three different kinds of oxygen peaks in O 1s XPS spectra of LCMO and LSCMO-x samples were observed: 529.59 eV (lattice oxygen, Olat), 531.42 eV (adsorbed oxygen, O<sub>ads</sub>), and 533.05 eV (molecular water).<sup>[41]</sup> The percentage of different oxygen forms has been calculated according to the ratios of peak area (Table S2). A series of previous studies have pointed out that the oxygen vacancy was associated with the adsorbed oxygen. As the adsorbed oxygen can provide efficient channels for electron transport and ion diffusion to accelerate the electrochemical reactions and electrode performance. [42] In LSCMO-0.8, the ratio of adsorbed oxygen was calculated at about 48.43%, the highest proportion in these compounds, which consist of the best electrochemical performances among LSCMO-x. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) curves of LCMO and LSCMO-x catalysts have also been measured to verify oxygen vacancy (Figure S9).

In previous studies, the precise valence, spin, and magnetic state of LCMO has been extensively studied. The result has confirmed that, Co and Mn are in high spin with +2 and +4 state in the ordered state, respectively. Also, LCMO shows only a ferromagnetic transition at  $T_{\rm c}\!=\!240~{\rm K}$  for the ordered arrangement of Co/Mn and it has been assigned to the Co²+ $-{\rm O}^2-{\rm Mn}^4+{\rm FM}$  superexchange interactions. Figures S7 show the temperature-dependent zero-field-cooling (ZFC) and field-cooling (FC) magnetization behavior for LCMO. It can be seen that the parent compound LCMO shows only a single magnetic transition at  $\sim\!240~{\rm K}$ , indicating Co and Mn are in high

spin with +2 and +4 state in the obtained LCMO. Besides, Sr doped into LCMO can induce the antisite disorder, leading to Co ions with mixed valence states as  $Co^{3+}$  and  $Co^{2+}$  and Mn present in mixed valence of Mn<sup>4+</sup> and Mn<sup>3+</sup> states.<sup>[31]</sup>

As illustrated in Figure 6, there are four prominent peaks located at around 641.51, 642.78, 653.05 and 654.25 eV, which can be ascribed to Mn  $2p_{3/2}$  (Mn³+), Mn  $2p_{3/2}$  (Mn⁴+), Mn  $2p_{1/2}$  (Mn³+) and Mn  $2p_{1/2}$  (Mn³+) spin-orbit peaks, respectively. [45] The calculated internal peak areas ratios of Mn³+/Mn⁴+ for the samples show that the Mn³+/Mn⁴+ ratio increases rapidly with an increase of Sr concentration. The relative concentration of Mn³+/Mn⁴+ species from Mn  $2p_{3/2}$  is shown in Table S3. For Co 2p (Figure S8), the two main peaks of Co  $2p_{3/2}$  and Co  $2p_{1/2}$  fitted well with the fitting peaks, which can be attributed to

Co<sup>2+</sup> and Co<sup>3+</sup>, respectively. The binding energies at 779.81 and 795.96 eV can be fitted into Co<sup>3+</sup>, and those at 780.73 and 796.47 eV were assigned to Co<sup>2+</sup>. There are two weak Co<sup>2+</sup> satellite peaks at around 786–790 and 800–805 eV at every curve, which is the characteristic of Co<sup>2+</sup>. Similarly, the internal peak areas for Co ions reveal that the Co<sup>3+</sup>/Co<sup>2+</sup> ratio increases stably with the content of Sr increasing. The relative concentration of Co<sup>2+</sup>/Co<sup>3+</sup> species from Co 2p<sub>3/2</sub> has been illustrated in Table S4.

The electronic-filled  $e_g$  orbit has become complex in these perovskite oxides for the mixed-valence states the B-site metal. It has been broadly reported that in antisite disordered LSCMO-x,  $Co^{2+}$  and  $Mn^{3+}$  ions are in high spin states  $(e_g^{\ 2}$  and  $e_g^{\ 1})$ . As there are two phase transitions in the magnetization curves of

LSCMO-0.8 (Figure S7b), the high-temperature magnetic transition is originally attributed to the ordered superexchange interaction of high spin Co<sup>2+</sup>-O-Mn<sup>4+</sup>, and the low-temperature transition is due to the vibronic superexchange interaction of the intermediate spin Co<sup>3+</sup> and high spin Mn<sup>3+</sup>.[47] Thus Co<sup>3+</sup> is in the intermediate spin state (e<sub>q</sub><sup>1</sup>), and Mn<sup>4+</sup> is in the low spin state  $(e_a^0)$ . The average filling electrons of  $e_a$  orbital (h) have been calculated according to the XPS data from LSCMO-x.[21] The average e<sub>a</sub> orbital-filling electron numbers of LSCMO-x samples are shown in Table S5. Based on Shao-Horn's theory, to reach the best OER activity, the e<sub>a</sub> orbital-filling electron should be  $1.^{[18]}$  Here, the most significant average  $e_q$  orbital electron number in LSCMO-x catalysts is LSCMO-0.8 (0.968), mostly close to 1. Therefore, LSCMO-0.8 is a promising OER electrocatalyst because of the optimized electronic structure, consisting of the electrochemical measurement result.

## Conclusion

In summary, a series of Sr-doped perovskite LSCMO-x (x=0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0) have been synthesized by a sol-gel method. The OER performance of these A-site partially substituted perovskites is improved, and LSCMO-0.8 in the system exhibited the highest OER activity. This may be ascribed to the increase of oxygen vacancies caused by Sr doped in the A-site and the optimized  $e_g$  orbital-filling electron. After 1000 durability tests, the OER activity slightly declined for all the prepared perovskites. This work highlights the importance of tailoring A-site partially substituted perovskites as an effective strategy to improve OER activity.

# **Experimental Section**

#### Synthesis of LSCMO-x

LSCMO-x powders have been prepared through the modified solgel method. La(NO $_3$ ) $_3$ ·6H $_2$ O (Macklin, 99.9%), Sr(NO $_3$ ) $_2$  (Aladdin, 99.5%), Co(NO $_3$ ) $_2$ ·6H $_2$ O (Aladdin, 99.99%), and Mn(NO $_3$ ) $_2$ ·4H $_2$ O (Macklin, 98%) with stoichiometric quantities were added into 150 mL deionized water. Then citric acid in the molar ratio with metals of 1:2 was added as a chelating agent. After stirring for 1 h, two droppers of ethylene glycol were added and stirring continued for another 1 h till a homogeneous aqueous solution is obtained. The formed products were maintained at 200°C for 12 h to remove excess water and then kept incubating at 400°C for 12 h. The outcomes were annealed at 900°C for 2 h to synthesize the perovskite catalysts finally.

#### Characterization of LSCMO-x

Powder XRD for LSCMO-x has been measured in a Bruker D8 powder system equipped with Cu K $\alpha$  ( $\lambda$ =1.5418 Å). The  $2\theta$  were performed in the range of 10– $120^{\circ}$  with a scan rate of  $1^{\circ}$  min<sup>-1</sup>. The surface morphology of LSCMO-x was obtained using a field emission SEM (FEI Inspect F50). TEM (FEI Tecnai F30 Twin) was conducted to characterize the microscopic structure. The surface valence of elements was investigated by XPS (Thermo Fisher, Escalab 250Xi). The BET surface area was calculated based on the corresponding  $N_2$  adsorption isotherm at 77 K using Quantachrome Instruments. The quantum design superconducting quantum interference device based magnetic properties measurement system (SQUID-MPMS) was employed to investigate the temperature dependence of DC magnetization (M-T) under a ZFC and a FC of 100 Oe of LCMO.

## Electrochemical Performances of LSCMO-x

The electrochemical measurements were performed on a standard three-electrode system in an electrochemical workstation (CHI 760E) at room temperature. A mixture of 10 mg catalysts powders and 5 mg carbon black were dispersed in 1 mL ethanol, and then 70  $\mu L$  Nafion solution was added. The carbon black was added to improve the conductivity of electrocatalysts. The mixture was dispersed by ultrasonic cleaner for 30 min to generate the

homogeneous ink. After that, 3 µL aliquot of the prepared ink was dropped on a mirror-polished glassy carbon electrode, yielding the loading mass of 0.397 mg cm<sup>-2</sup>. Then the glassy carbon electrode was dried and worked as the working electrode. A Hg/HgO electrode and a graphite rod were used as reference and counting electrodes, respectively. The electrolyte was 1.0 M KOH solution with saturated  $O_2$ . LSV was performed at a scan rate of 5 mV·s<sup>-1</sup> and without internal resistance (iR) compensation. All potentials were converted to a RHE scale through the following equation: E(vs. RHE) = E(vs. Hg/HgO) + 0.098 + 0.0591 × pH.  $C_{dl}$  was obtained through CV measurements at the current density of 20, 40, 60, 80, 100 mV s<sup>-1</sup> in the non-Faraday region. EIS were recorded at open circuit potential with the frequency from 100 kHz to 0.01 Hz. The stability measurements were performed by continuous potential cycling between 0.2 and 0.8 V at a scan rate of 10 mV s<sup>-1</sup> for 1000 cycles in 1.0 M KOH. After 1000 cycles, the resulting electrodes were recorded at a scan rate of 5 mV s<sup>-1</sup>.

**Abstract:** The exploration of earth-abundant and efficient electrocatalysts toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is critical for sustainable energy storage and conversion devices. In this work, we report a selfengaged strategy to fabricate a yolk-shelled OER electrocatalyst. Starting with a metal–organic framework, Co-Fe layered double hydroxide (LDH)@zeolitic imidazolate framework-67 (ZIF-67) yolk-shelled structures are formed in one step. Afterwards, these ZIF-67 building blocks are transformed into Ni-Co LDH nanocages to form the Ni-Co-Fe hydr(oxy)oxide@Ni-Co LDH yolk-shelled microrods (NiCoFe-HO@NiCo-LDH YSMRs) through an ion-exchange reaction. Owing to the structural and compositional merits, the NiCoFe-HO@NiCo-LDH YSMR electrocatalyst exhibits an overpotential of 278 mV to reach the current density of 10 mAcm <sup>2</sup> , a small Tafel slope of 49.7 mVdec <sup>1</sup> , and good stability in alkaline media.

*I*<sup>n</sup> the foreseeable future, the renewable energy consumption structure will certainly replace the existing energy consumption structure because of the fast depletion of fossil fuels.[1] Urgent demand of renewable energy has promoted intensive study on exploring highly efficient energy conversion technologies.[2,3] Significantly, as an ideal energy carrier, hydrogen has attracted broad attention because of its environmental friendliness and high calorific value.[4,5] Electrochemical water splitting provides a cost-efficient and sustainable approach for hydrogen generation. However, the development of highly effective water splitting is immensely blocked by the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with the sluggish four-electron transfer process.[6,7] Thus, it is worth exploring high-performance OER electrocatalysts to promote the water splitting.[8] Even the most efficient electrocatalysts based on precious metals require a substantial overpotential (*η*) to reach the desired current densities, but their reserves on earth are quite limited.[9–11] substitute the noble metal-based electrocatalysts.[12] Iron (Fe) hydr(oxy)oxides have gained considerable attention owing to their abundant reserves and promising

Accordingly, it is particularly important to develop earthabundant, stable and highly efficient electrocatalysts to

activity for OER.[13] However, the OER performance of Febased electrocatalysts is still far from satisfactory, which is restricted by the poor intrinsic activity and dissolution of active Fe species during the stability test.[14–16] Recently, the construction of M-Fe (M=Ni, Co) layered double hydroxide (LDH) has been considered as a promising strategy to improve the OER performance of Fe-based hydr- (oxy)oxides.[17, 18] The interaction of orbital electrons between diverse metals could induce delicate atomic arrangement to alter the chemical environment for Fe-based electrocatalysts.[19] Specifically, the rational regulation of the 3d electronic structure could endow the Fe-based electrocatalysts with favorable adsorption/desorption of oxygenated intermediates.[20] Other than the compositional regulation, designing complex hollow structures with a yolkshelled feature is another effective tactic to promote the OER performance.[21, 22] Specifically, the capillary effect between shells could accelerate the mass transport.[23, 24] Besides, the solid interior could reinforce the structural stability of the electrocatalyst.[25] Therefore, it is highly desirable to search an effective and facile synthetic method to obtain Fe-based hydr(oxy)oxides with complex hollow features.[21, 22] Template-engaged synthesis has proven its superiority for preparing diverse hollow micro-/nanostructures without any redundant template-removal process.[26] As a typical self-engaged precursor, metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have been demonstrated with unique advantages for preparing a wide range of advanced electrocatalysts with high compositional and architectural complexity.[27]

Herein, we report a MOF-engaged approach for the formation of the hierarchical Ni-Co-Fe hydr(oxy)oxide@Ni-Co LDH yolk-shelled microrods (denoted as NiCoFe-HO@NiCo-LDH YSMRs) via a two-step conversion process (Figure 1). Starting from MIL-88A (a Fe-containing MOF) microrods, Co-Fe LDH@zeolitic imidazolate framework-67 (ZIF-67) (denoted as CoFe-LDH@ZIF-67) YSMRs are first obtained through a conversion reaction. The existence of Co<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> ions in the 2-methylimidazole solution leads to the phase evolution of MIL-88A into Co-Fe LDH and the simultaneous self-assembly of ZIF-67 particles around the newly formed outermost shell. Moreover, this self-assembly strategy can be extended to produce ZnFe-LDH@ZIF-8 YSMRs and Zn-Co-Fe hydr(oxy)oxide@Zn-Co ZIF core–

shelled microrods (denoted as ZnCoFe-HO@ZnCo-ZIF CSMRs). Afterwards, the secondary ion-exchange reaction between Ni2<sup>+</sup> ions and CoFe-LDH@ZIF-67 YSMRs further leads to the transformation of ZIF layer into the interconnected Ni-Co LDH nanocages around the internal Ni-Co-Fe hydr(oxy)oxide microrods forming NiCoFe-HO@NiCo-LDH YSMRs. The interconnected Ni-Co LDH nanocages could strengthen the mass transport through the capillary effect. The Ni and Co species within the Ni-Co-Fe hydr- (oxy)oxide alter the chemical environment of internal Fe element to accelerate the OER and suppress the dissolution of active species. As an electrocatalyst for OER, the NiCoFe-HO@NiCo-LDH YSMRs require a low *η* of 278 mV to deliver the current density of 10 mAcm <sup>2</sup> , with a small Tafel slope of 49.7 mVdec <sup>1</sup> and good stability.

The morphology evolution at each stage is characterized by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As revealed by Figure 2a–c, the solid MIL-88A precursors exhibit a rodlike structure with an average length of 4.5 μm and a width of 600 nm. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern confirms the crystallographic form of MIL-88A (Figure S1, Supporting Information). Owing to the strong coordination ability of N and/or C=O functional groups to metal atoms, polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) is then applied to functionalize the surface of MIL-88A microrods.[28] After a subsequent selfassembly process, the resultant CoFe-LDH@ZIF-67 YSMRs are fully covered by ZIF-67 polyhedrons (Figure 2d,e and Figure S2, Supporting Information). Meanwhile, a 400-nm shell can be observed for these YSMRs (Figure 2f). The Fourier transform infrared spectrum of CoFe-LDH@ZIF-67

YSMRs (Figure S3, Supporting Information) shows no peaks located at 1211 cm <sup>1</sup> (stretching vibration mode of C O bond) and 646 cm <sup>1</sup> (stretching vibration mode of C H bonds). This result further confirms that the CoFe-LDH@ZIF-67 YSMRs are not a simple mixture of ZIF-67 and MIL-88A. The internal MIL-88A might be converted into an LDH-like structure. To validate the generality of this self-engaged conversion approach, Co<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> ions are replaced by Zn2<sup>+</sup> ions or a mixture of Zn2<sup>+</sup> ions and Co<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> ions. FESEM and TEM images show the obtained ZnFe-LDH@ZIF-8 YSMRs (Figure 2g,h) and ZnCoFe-HO@Zn-Co-ZIF CSMRs (Figure 2i,j). The XRD patterns also demonstrate the conversion process simultaneously changes the crystal phase of MIL-88A template for ZnFe-LDH@ZIF-8 YSMRs and ZnCoFe-HO@ZnCo-ZIF CSMRs (Figure S4 and Figure S5, Supporting Information).

With the subsequent ion-exchange reaction with Ni2<sup>+</sup> ions, the obtained NiCoFe-HO@NiCo-LDH YSMRs retain the rod-like morphology with a more complex surface (Figure 3a). A magnified FESEM image clearly shows that the interconnected ZIF-67 shell is turned into a bubble-like layer assembled by numerous nanocages (Figure 3b). TEM image further elaborates that the nanocages are steadily supported on solid microrod (Figure 3c). No obvious collapse can be observed until the reaction time is extended to 50 min, indicating the robustness of the nanobubbles (Figure S6, Supporting Information). The magnified TEM image has demonstrated that each nanocage is constructed by loosely interconnected LDH nanoflakes (Figure 3d). High-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image reveals clear lattice fringes with a spacing of 0.26 nm within these polycrystalline

ultrafine nanoflakes, corresponding to the (012) plane of LDH (Figure 3e).[29] Also, the weak XRD pattern of NiCoFe-HO@NiCo-LDH YSMRs can be assigned to the typical LDH phase (Figure S7, Supporting Information).[18] Scanning TEM (STEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) elemental mapping images indicate the uniform distribution of Ni, Co and Fe throughout the inner microrod (Figure 3f– i). Whereas, the bubble-like shell only contains Ni and Co elements. The EDX spectrum of NiCoFe-HO@NiCo-LDH YSMRs shows a Ni/Co/Fe molar ratio of 1: 0.44: 0.62 (Figure S8, Supporting Information). The formation of this unique hierarchical structure relies on the two-step conversion strategy. Without the addition of 2-methylimidazole, only smooth Co-Fe based microrods (CoFe-MIL MRs) are generated (Figure S9, Supporting Information). If no ZIF layer is introduced, only Ni-Fe LDH nanoclips (NiFe-LDH NCs) can be obtained (Figure S10, Supporting Information). Interestingly, the morphology of MIL-88A can be generally retained, but the surface is highly broken. Besides, only stacked Ni-Co LDH nanosheets (NiCo-LDH NSs) can be obtained without the engagement of MIL-88A template (Figure S11, Supporting Information). If only a direct ionexchange reaction is applied, NiCoFe-HO MRs can be obtained with a relatively rough surface and similar Ni/Co/ Fe molar ratio (Figure S12a,b, Supporting Information). Xray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses are conducted to examine the chemical composition on the surface of the NiCoFe-HO@NiCo-LDH YSMRs. Specifically, the Ni 2p spectrum is deconvoluted into two spin-orbit peaks of Ni 2p1/2 (873.61 eV) and Ni 2p3/2 (856.11 eV), revealing the existence of Ni<sup>3</sup><sup>+</sup> species (Figure S13, Supporting Information).[30] From the deconvolution results of the Co 2p spectrum, two dominant peaks are located at 797.01 eV and 781.41 eV, which can be assigned to the 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 of Co<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> species, respectively (Figure S14, Supporting Information).[31, 32] In addition, the signal of the Fe 2p is quite weak with a broad peak related with the Co (LMM) Auger transition, confirming the insufficient distribution of Fe species at the outermost shell (Figure S15, Supporting Information).[33] The co-existence of Ni and Co species might contribute to a better redistribution of the π-symmetry electrons toward the favorable adsorption/desorption of the oxygen species for NiCoFe-HO@NiCo-LDH YSMRs.[34]

The OER performance of the as-prepared NiCoFe-HO@NiCo-LDH YSMRs is evaluated in the alkaline solution (1.0 M KOH). For comparison, NiCo-LDH NSs, CoFe-MIL MRs and NiFe-LDH NCs are also studied. As illustrated by the *iR*-compensated linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves (Figure 4a), the NiCoFe-HO@NiCo-LDH YSMRs show the best OER activity among the electrocatalysts. In particular, a low *η* of 278 mV is required for NiCoFe-HO@NiCo-LDH YSMRs to reach the current

density of  $10 \,\mathrm{mA\,cm^{-2}}$  (Figure 4b). Besides, at the  $\eta$  of 350 mV, the NiCoFe-HO@NiCo-LDH YSMRs could deliver a current density of 86.2 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, which is 2-fold, 5.9-fold and more than 40-fold higher than the CoFe-MIL MRs, NiCo-LDH NSs and NiFe-LDH NCs, respectively (Figure 4c). Besides, the OER performance of NiCoFe-HO@NiCo-LDH YSMRs is much better than that of NiCoFe-HO MRs (Figure S12c, Supporting Information). As shown in Figure 4d, the corresponding Tafel slope of NiCoFe-HO@NiCo-LDH YSMRs (49.7 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>) is much lower than that of NiCo-LDH NSs (79.2 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>) and NiFe-LDH NCs (91.2 mv dec<sup>-1</sup>), indicating the promoted reaction kinetics. The activity of NiCoFe-HO@NiCo-LDH YSMRs is also comparable or even superior to some 3d transition metal based electrocatalysts (Table S1. Information).[35-44] To evaluate the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA), cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of electrocatalysts are measured at different scan rates in the non-Faradaic regions under the same conditions used for the OER tests (Figure S16, Supporting Information). [45,46] The parasitic current from the glassy carbon electrode (GCE) is very small, which is omitted during the ECSA evaluation (Figure S17, Supporting Information). Based on the capacitive current density against the scan rate, the double-layer capacitance (C<sub>dl</sub>) value of NiCoFe-HO@NiCo-LDH YSMRs is much larger than that of CoFe-MIL MRs, NiFe-LDH NCs, but smaller than that of NiCo-LDH NSs (Figure 4e). The enhanced ECSA of NiCoFe-HO@NiCo-LDH YSMRs may be attributed to the yolk-shelled structure and interconnected nanocages with better mass transport (Figure 4f). To thoroughly investigate the inherent catalytic activity of NiCoFe-HO@NiCo-LDH YSMRs towards OER, turnover frequency (TOF) measurements are performed (Figure S18, Supporting Information). [47] The TOF value at the n of 278 mV for NiCoFe-HO@NiCo-LDH YSMRs is 0.051 s<sup>-1</sup>, which is much higher than that of NiCo-LDH NSs, NiFe-LDH NCs and CoFe-MIL MRs (Figure 4g). To evaluate the stability, Ni foam (Figure S19, Supporting Information) is used as the support for NiCoFe-HO@NiCo-LDH YSMRs to avoid the potential loss of active species. Moreover, after continuous CV scans at 50 mV s<sup>-1</sup> in a voltage range of 0.3– 0.8 V vs. Hg/HgO for 4000 cycles, the obtained LSV curve of NiCoFe-HO@NiCo-LDH YSMRs on Ni foam is similar to the initial one, demonstrating the good cycling stability (Figure 4h). Under the constant  $\eta$  of 280 mV, chronoamperometry measurement shows that the current density of the NiCoFe-HO@NiCo-LDH YSMRs remains stable for at least 11 h with a small degradation of 1.7%, proving its robustness once again (Figure 4i).

To further understand the reason for this excellent OER performance, we carry out various characterizations on NiCoFe-HO@NiCo-LDH YSMRs. According to the Raman spectrum in Figure 5a, the peak for Ni species in NiCoFe-HO@NiCo-LDH YSMRs located at 545 cm<sup>-1</sup> can be

attributed to the Ni-O variation in *β*-NiOOH, which could promote the OER performance.[48,49] Moreover, electrochemical poison experiments are conducted through the introduction of SCN or NO2 for clarifying the specific roles of different metals in NiCoFe-HO@NiCo-LDH YSMRs (Figure 5b). As expected, there is a drastic performance decay for NiCoFe-HO@NiCo-LDH YSMRs in the electrolyte containing SCN . In comparison, only a slight drop in activity is observed in the NO2 -containing electrolyte. The nitrite absorption on NiCoFe-HO@NiCo-LDH YSMRs can be confirmed by CV measurements (Figure 5c), and it is suggested to take place through the strong interaction with Fe species.[50–52] This observation suggests that the Ni/Co species in NiCoFe-HO@NiCo-LDH YSMRs might also contribute greatly to the OER activity. Besides, the signal of the Fe 2p XPS spectrum for NiCoFe-HO@NiCo-LDH YSMRs after the stability test by applying a potential of 1.5 V for 1 h is almost unchanged (Figure 5d), confirming that the dissolution of Fe species is insignificant during the OER process. This again confirms the high stability of the NiCoFe-HO@NiCo-LDH YSMRs.

In summary, we report an elaborate conversion strategy to fabricate NiCoFe-HO@NiCo-LDH YSMRs as an efficient OER electrocatalyst. Benefiting from structural advantages from the yolk-shelled structure and synergistic effect from the Ni, Co and Fe elements with strong interactions, the obtained NiCoFe-HO@NiCo-LDH YSMRs exhibit large ECSA and reduced dissolution of active species. As a result, the hierarchical complex hollow electrocatalyst exhibits enhanced activity and stability.

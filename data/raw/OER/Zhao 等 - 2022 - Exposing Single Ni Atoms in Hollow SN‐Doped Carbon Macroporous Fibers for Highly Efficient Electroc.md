# Exposing Single Ni Atoms in Hollow S/N-Doped Carbon Macroporous Fibers for Highly Efficient Electrochemical Oxygen Evolution

Yafei Zhao, Yan Guo, Xue Feng Lu, Deyan Luan, Xiaojun Gu,\* and Xiong Wen (David) Lou\*

The development of efficient and cost-effective electrocatalysts toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is highly desirable for clean energy and fuel conversion. Herein, the facile preparation of Ni single atoms embedded hollow S/N-doped carbon macroporous fibers (Ni SAs@S/N-CMF) as efficient catalysts for OER through pyrolysis of designed CdS-NiS $_x$ /polyacrylonitrile composite fibers is reported. Specifically, CdS provides the sulfur source for the doping of polyacrylonitrile-derived carbon matrix and simultaneously creates the hollow macroporous structure, while NiS $_x$  is first reduced to nanoparticles and finally evolves into single Ni atoms through the atom migration-trapping strategy. Benefiting from the abundantly exposed single Ni atoms and hollow macroporous structure, the resultant Ni SAs@S/N-CMF electrocatalysts deliver outstanding activity and stability for OER. Specifically, it needs an overpotential of 285 mV to achieve the benchmark current density of 10 mA cm $^{-2}$  with a small Tafel slope of 50.8 mV dec $^{-1}$ .

#### 1. Introduction

The electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a vital reaction and usually a limiting step in many electrochemical devices that holds great potential for clean energy storage and conversion, including rechargeable metal—air batteries and reversible fuel cells.<sup>[1–5]</sup> However, the multistep proton-coupled electron transfer processes impede its kinetics because of the high energy barriers, leading to a high overpotential to achieve the desired current density.<sup>[6–8]</sup> Up to now, Ru/Ir-based oxides have been proven to be the benchmark OER electrocatalysts, which yet greatly suffer from high cost and poor stability.<sup>[9–12]</sup>

Hence, there is an urgent need to develop efficient and low-cost transition metal-based electrocatalysts as promising alternatives to Ru/Ir-based electrocatalysts, to significantly upgrade the present energy-related devices for achieving large-scale commercialization.

Recently, single-atom catalysts (SACs), featuring maximized atom-utilization efficiency, uniform metal active sites, and adjustable coordination environments, have become a promising candidate for OER. [13–18] Although gratifying progress has been made, SACs still face many challenges, including low atom loading, limited exposure sites, and poor molecular accessibility. [19] Specifically, these reported SACs are usually synthesized through a bottom-up method, in which limited metal cations are first adsorbed in a defect-

rich solid substrate and then reduced into isolated metal sites spreading over the entire matrix.<sup>[20]</sup> Moreover, these metal sites are mostly stabilized and trapped in confined spaces or inaccessible regions, which generally do not participate in catalytic reactions, thus resulting in unsatisfactory OER performance.

To address these problems, a favorable architecture, for instance, hollow nanostructures, might greatly improve the catalytic performance by dramatically improving the surface areato-volume ratio and maximally exposing the metal sites. These merits will eventually boost the intrinsic activity of SACs. Some advanced carbon-based materials decorated with single-atoms have been prepared for efficient OER. For instance, nitrogendoped holey graphene frameworks loaded with single Ni sites have been fabricated and shown to exhibit enhanced OER performance.<sup>[21]</sup> These works highlight the vital role of spatial structure on the performance of SACs. Therefore, exploring novel strategies toward advanced architectures is highly desired for maximizing the activity of SACs but remains a challenge.

Herein, we report the preparation of novel Ni single atoms embedded hollow S/N-doped carbon macroporous fibers (designated as Ni SAs@S/N-CMF) as promising catalysts for OER through pyrolysis of rationally designed CdS-NiS $_x$ / polyacrylonitrile composite fibers. Briefly, starting from CdS solid nanoparticles (NPs), the NiS $_x$  species are then deposited on the surface of the CdS NPs to obtain the CdS-NiS $_x$  NPs. Afterward, the CdS-NiS $_x$  NPs are electrospun with polyacrylonitrile

(PAN) to yield the CdS-NiS*x*/PAN composite fibers (denoted as CdS-NiS*x*@PAN). Following a carbonization treatment, the resultant Ni SAs@S/N-CMF catalysts are obtained. Thanks to the advantages of the abundantly exposed single Ni atoms and hollow macroporous structure, the resultant Ni SAs@S/N-CMF electrocatalysts deliver superior electrocatalytic performance for OER with an overpotential of 285 mV at 10 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> , a small Tafel slope of 50.8 mV dec<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> , and good stability.

## **2. Results and Discussion**

Solid CdS NPs are used as the starting material. A panoramic field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) image shows that these CdS NPs are highly uniform with an average diameter of about 210 nm (Figure S1a,b, Supporting Information). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image demonstrates their solid nature (Figure S1c, Supporting Information). The energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis of the CdS NPs demonstrates that the atomic ratio of Cd and S is ≈1:1 (Figure S1d, Supporting Information). After depositing NiS*x* on the surface of as-prepared CdS NPs through a facile hydrothermal method,[22] the resultant CdS-NiS*x* NPs well inherit the original morphology of CdS with a similar uniform size distribution (Figure S2a–c, Supporting Information). EDX spectrum of obtained CdS-NiS*x* NPs reveals that the atomic percentage of the Ni atoms is about 0.63% (Figure S2d, Supporting Information). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of CdS-NiS*x* (Figure S3, Supporting Information) shows that all the diffraction peaks can be matched to a well-crystallized CdS (JCPDS card no. 41–1049). The absence of the diffraction peaks for NiS*x* indicates its low content and/or poor crystallinity. The CdS-NiS*x* NPs are compactly assembled with PAN through the electrospinning process, forming hierarchical solid fibers (**Figure 1**a–c). TEM images verify that the CdS-NiS*x* NPs are well dispersed within the whole fiber (Figure 1d,e). Additionally, the thickness of the PAN layer is about 10.5 nm (Figure 1f). The high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) image and the corresponding elemental mapping images of an individual CdS-NiS*x*@PAN fiber demonstrate the homogenous distribution of C, N, S, Cd, and Ni elements over the whole fiber (Figure 1g).

After the carbonization treatment under a nitrogen atmosphere at 950 °C, the solid CdS-NiS*x*@PAN fibers are transformed into hollow macroporous fibers (Figure S4a, Supporting Information). The hollow structure of the asobtained Ni SAs@S/N-CMF can be confirmed by FESEM images (**Figure 2**a,b). The magnified FESEM image reveals that the hollow Ni SAs@S/N-CMF possesses a rough surface (Figure 2c). In addition, HAADF-STEM images also demonstrate that the Ni SAs@S/N-CMF samples are composed of interconnected hollow carbon spheres packed in a space-efficient arrangement (Figure 2d,e).[23] Moreover, no obvious Ni clusters or NPs are observed (Figure 2f and Figure S5, Supporting Information). To elucidate the atomic form of these invisible Ni species, we further utilized aberration-corrected HAADF-STEM measurements to directly discern these Ni species. As shown in Figure 2g, the atomically dispersed Ni sites

can be observed on the wall of the carbon sheath. The HAADF-STEM and corresponding elemental mapping images reveal the uniform distribution of C, N, S, and Ni elements in a single Ni SAs@S/N-CMF (Figure 2h). It is interesting to find that the signals of Cd are not detected in the as-prepared Ni SAs@S/N-CMF, indicating that the Cd species are completely volatilized during the pyrolysis. More importantly, the Cd metal vapor can be easily deposited and recycled on the homemade collectors (Figure S6, Supporting Information), indicating the synthesis is environmentally friendly. The Ni content in Ni SAs@S/N-CMF is about 2.58 wt% according to the inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy result (Table S1, Supporting Information).

Morphological observations are further conducted to study the structural evolution process at different temperatures. As the annealing temperature plays a vital role in CdS-NiS*x* volatilization, we control the annealing temperature to capture the corresponding intermediate products. Representative FESEM and TEM images show that the CdS-NiS*x*@PAN fibers could remain unchanged even when the annealing temperature reaches 650 °C (**Figure 3**a,e and Figure S7, Supporting Information). When the annealing temperature is elevated to 750 °C, some CdS-NiS*x* NPs evaporate from the supports, leaving PANderived carbon voids (Figure 3b,f and Figure S8, Supporting Information). The CdS-NiS*x* NPs completely volatilize when the annealing temperature reaches 850 °C (Figure 3c,g and Figure S9, Supporting Information). Moreover, the highresolution TEM images reveal that some ultra-small Ni NPs are formed in the skeleton of the as-obtained hollow fibers (Figures S10 and S11, Supporting Information). Further elevating the annealing temperature to 950 °C, these Ni NPs vanish fully. The thermogravimetric analysis reveals that about 95.6% of the mass loss occurs during the annealing process from room temperature to 950 °C (Figure S12, Supporting

Information). We thus propose the evolution process as illustrated in Figure 3i. Specifically, when the annealing temperature is below 650 °C, the CdS-NiS*x* NPs keep stabilized, showing their original solid structure. As the annealing temperature is raised above the boiling point of the metallic Cd (765 °C), the Cd species are sharply volatilized, thus generating hollow macroporous fibers.[24] The readily volatile S species (boiling point of 444 °C) simultaneously sulfurize the PANderived carbon skeletons. These residual Ni species could be efficiently reduced into Ni NPs at 850 °C and further atomized into single Ni atoms at 950 °C, finally yielding the thermodynamically stable Ni SAs@S/N-CMF catalyst.

N2 sorption isotherms (Figure S13, Supporting Information) reveal that the Ni SAs@S/N-CMF catalyst possesses a Brunauer–Emmett–Teller specific surface area of 114 m2 g−<sup>1</sup> , which is much higher than that of Ni NPs@S/N-CMF (34.9 m2 g−<sup>1</sup> ). XRD is further carried out to clarify the crystalline structure. As shown in **Figure 4**a, the Ni NPs@S/N-CMF catalyst exhibits an obvious characteristic peak of the (111) plane of the Ni crystals (JCPDS card no. 04-0850). However, no characteristic peaks of Ni are observed in the XRD pattern of the Ni SAs@S/N-CMF catalyst, further indicating the complete transformation of Ni NPs to single atoms. Also, both the Ni NPs@S/N-CMF and Ni SAs@S/N-CMF display similar Raman spectra with typical D and G bands of carbon (Figure S14, Supporting Information). Furthermore, as shown by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis, the binding energy of Ni 2p3/2 peak at 853.9 eV for the Ni SAs@S/N-CMF catalyst is higher than that of Ni NPs@S/N-CMF (853.5 eV) and the reported Ni<sup>0</sup> (853.0 eV), but lower than that of the reported Ni2<sup>+</sup> ions (855.1 eV). This result indicates the ionic Ni*δ*+ (0 < *δ* < 2) nature of the single Ni sites in Ni SAs@S/N-CMF (Figure 4b and Figure S15, Supporting Information).[25]

X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) is another mighty tool for discerning SACs. As shown in Figure 4c, over the whole range of 2.0 to 10.0 Å−<sup>1</sup> , the *k*<sup>2</sup> *χ*(*k*) oscillation curve of the Ni SAs@S/N-CMF catalyst at the Ni K-edge shows a different trend in shape and oscillating frequency. These results indicate that the coordination configuration of the Ni species in the Ni SAs@S/N-CMF catalyst is quite different from that of Ni NPs@S/N-CMF, Ni2O3, and Ni foil. The Fourier transform (FT) of the Ni K-edge extended X-ray absorption fine spectrum (EXAFS) of the Ni SAs@S/N-CMF catalyst (Figure 4d) exhibits a dominant NiN scattering path at around 1.4 Å, indicating the Ni species are coordinated with N rather than S.[26] For Ni NPs@S/N-CMF, an obvious NiNi scattering path can be observed at around 2.2 Å. The corresponding EXAFS fitting results demonstrate that the coordination number of the

resultant Ni–N bond is about 4 with an average bond length of 1.87 Å (Figure S16 and Table S2, Supporting Information). In addition, the energy position of the absorption edge of the Ni SAs@S/N-CMF is situated between those of Ni foil and Ni<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, further confirming the intermediate valence state nature (Figure S17, Supporting Information). It is in good agreement with the XPS results discussed above. The detailed wavelet transform (WT) analyses provide a higher resolution in both radial space and K space. As shown in Figure 4e, compared with the WT contour plots of Ni NPs@S/N-CMF (Ni–Ni at about 7.3 Å<sup>-1</sup>) and Ni<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> (Ni–Ni at about 6.6 Å<sup>-1</sup> and Ni–O at about 4.5 Å<sup>-1</sup>), only the Ni–N scattering path located at about 5 Å<sup>-1</sup> is observed for Ni SAs@S/N-CMF, again verifying that the transformation from Ni NPs to single-atomic Ni sites has indeed taken place.

Electron paramagnetic resonance is an efficient technique for detecting unpaired electrons in materials.<sup>[27,28]</sup> The intensity at the g value of 2.003 for Ni SAs@S/N-CMF is higher than that of Ni NPs@S/N-CMF, suggesting that abundant C and N defects emerge on the skeleton of Ni SAs@S/N-CMF during the atomization process (Figure S18, Supporting Information).[29-31] Besides, the N K-edge X-ray absorption near edge structure spectrum (Figure S19, Supporting Information) reveals that three peaks can be attributed to the  $\pi^*$ -transition of pyridinic-N (peak a) and graphitic-N (peak b), and the  $\sigma^*$ transition of C-N bonds (peak c). It is worthwhile to note that the pyridinic-N is divided into double peaks (a1 and a2), manifesting that a portion of pyridinic-N is bonded to the Ni atoms.[32,33] These pyridinic-N sites could share one p-electron to the adjacent p-conjugated system, which would further boost the chemical stabilization of single Ni sites.[34,35]

The electrochemical OER performance of Ni SAs@S/N-CMF was performed in a 1.0 м KOH solution with commercial RuO<sub>2</sub>,

Ni-free S/N-CMF (Figures S20 and S21, Supporting Information), and Ni NPs@S/N-CMF as references. Figure 5a displays the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) plots of the four samples. The Ni SAs@S/N-CMF catalyst requires only a small overpotential ( $\eta_{10}$ ) of 285 mV to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> (Figure 5b), clearly outperforming Ni NPs@S/N-CMF (391 mV), Ni-free S/N-CMF (471 mV), and RuO2 (366 mV). Benefiting from the hollow macroporous structure which facilitates mass transfer during OER, an impressive Tafel slope of 50.8 mV dec<sup>-1</sup> is obtained for the Ni SAs@S/N-CMF catalyst (Figure 5c), which is superior to that of Ni NPs@S/N-CMF (81.9 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>), Ni-free S/N-CMF (141 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>), and RuO<sub>2</sub> (100.9 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>). Additionally, a high turnover frequency (TOF) value of 0.16 s<sup>-1</sup> is obtained for the Ni SAs@S/N-CMF catalyst at the overpotential of 300 mV (Figure 5d), which is much higher than that of Ni NPs@S/N-CMF (0.006 s<sup>-1</sup>), demonstrating the high utilization of Ni atoms in the catalytic processes. Based on the above results, the Ni SAs@S/N-CMF catalyst displays enhanced OER activity and kinetics compared to Ni NPs@S/N-CMF and Ni-free S/N-CMF catalysts. Importantly, the OER activity and kinetics of this Ni SAs@S/N-CMF catalyst are outstanding, and comparable with the most active transition-metal-based OER electrocatalysts reported (Table S3, Supporting Information).

We further assess the electrochemically active surface area of Ni SAs@S/N-CMF and Ni NPs@S/N-CMF by measuring the electrochemical double-layer capacitance ( $C_{\rm dl}$ ). As expected, the Ni SAs@S/N-CMF catalyst possesses more surface exposed active sites with a  $C_{\rm dl}$  value of 3.04 mF cm<sup>-2</sup> (Figure 5e and Figure S22, Supporting Information), which is about 11.7 times that of Ni NPs@S/N-CMF (0.26 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy investigation is further carried out. The Ni SAs@S/N-CMF catalyst displays a smaller charge transfer resistance than Ni NPs@S/N-CMF and Ni-free S/N-CMF,

implying a faster charge-transfer process during the OER process (Figure S23, Supporting Information). The chronoamperometry curve of Ni SAs@S/N-CMF shows long-term OER stability with a negligible increase in potential after a 60-h test at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> (Figure 5f). By contrast, the Ni NPs@S/N-CMF and commercial RuO2 exhibit apparently increased overpotential only after 10 h. In addition, the Ni SAs@S/N-CMF catalyst shows a slight activity decay in the LSV curves before and after the stability test (Figure S24, Supporting Information). The hollow structure of Ni SAs@S/N-CMF is maintained after the long-term OER test (Figure S25, Supporting Information). The positive shift of the binding energy implies a slight increase in the valence state of Ni after the reaction (Figure S26, Supporting Information). After the stability test, the Ni SAs@S/N-CMF catalyst could retain the hollow fiber structure (Figure S27a, Supporting Information), and the single Ni sites in the Ni SAs@S/N-CMF catalyst also keep isolated distribution and good stability (Figure S27b,c, Supporting Information). These results unequivocally indicate that the Ni SAs@S/N-CMF catalyst possesses excellent chemical and structural stability. The low current intensities associated with the low metal loading are not yet able to make our catalyst suitable for industry-level OER requirements (current density > 500 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>) or other related applications, [38] which still need to be further optimized in the future.

#### 3. Conclusion

Novel Ni single atoms embedded hollow S/N-doped carbon macroporous fibers (Ni SAs@S/N-CMF) have been prepared

as a promising OER electrocatalyst. The synthetic method can readily control the structure and composition of the resultant hollow fibers. Benefiting from the abundant exposed single Ni atoms and hollow macroporous structure, the resultant Ni SAs@S/N-CMF electrocatalyst delivers excellent OER performance with an overpotential of 285 mV at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, a Tafel slope of 50.8 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>, and outstanding durability. This work may offer some inspiration for designing and constructing efficient SACs for various challenging reactions.

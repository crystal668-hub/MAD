*Ming Liu, Lingjun Kong, Xuemin Wang, Jie He, and Xian-He Bu\**

Dedicated to the 100th anniversary of Nankai University

**Benefiting from metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) unique structural characteristics, their versatility in composition and structure has been well explored in electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER) processes. Here, a ligand/ionic exchange phenomenon of MOFs is reported in alkaline solution due to their poor stability, and the active species and reaction mechanism of MOFs are revealed in the OER process. A series of mixed Ni-MOFs and Fe-MOFs are synthesized by straightforward sonication and then directly used as catalyst candidates for OER in alkaline electrolyte. It can be confirmed via ex situ transmission electron microscopic images and X-ray diffraction patterns analysis, that the bimetallic hydroxide (NiFe-LDH) is generated in 1.0 m KOH in situ and acts as protagonist for oxygen evolution. The optimized catalyst (FN-2) exhibits a lower overpotential (275 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> ) and excellent long-term stability (strong current density for 100 h without fading). The revelation of the real active species of MOF materials may contribute to better understanding of the reaction mechanism.**

## **1. Introduction**

With the evergrowing consumption of nonrenewable energy such as fossil energy and environmental degradation, it is of great significance to exploring high-efficiency and environmentfriendly technologies.[1] Oxygen evolution reaction (OER), as one of the prime steps in many electrochemical energy systems such as zinc–air batteries and water splitting, has attracted wide

attention.[2] Nevertheless, it is urgent to develop OER catalysts with higher activity and better stability to accelerate the kinetics of multielectron transfer.[3] Noble metalbased materials (e.g., IrO2 and RuO2) show excellent catalytic activity and stability, but their low earth reserves and high prices hinder further development.[4] For some time in the past, a great deal of effort has been devoted to the preparation of highly active and low-cost catalysts, such as metal oxides/hydroxides,[5] carbides,[6] sulfides,[7] and phosphides.[8]

According to research, optimal OER electrocatalysts should possess the electrical conductivity and rich active sites.[9] Metal– organic frameworks (MOFs), with accessible metal active sites and ordered pores, have attracted extensive attention in the past period and show great potential in catalysis.[10] Unfortunately, most of MOFs

bear intrinsic low electronic conductivity and poor stability, becoming a significant bottleneck limiting its application in the field of electrocatalysis.[11,12] Thereby, several strategies have been proposed to overcome above-mentioned problems. One is to use MOFs as precursors to prepare nanomaterials by pyrolysis at high temperature.[13] However, it may lead to the destruction of the intrinsic structure of MOFs and the loss of the active sites. Another strategy is to assemble MOFs hybridization with a conductive substrate such as metal foam or carbon materials, but it will waste the raw materials and also be limited by the morphologies and sizes of materials. Therefore, rational design of highly efficient OER electrocatalysts by utilizing the structural advantages of MOF materials remains a challenge.

Recently, some MOF materials were directly acted as OER electrocatalysts via optimizing and utilizing their structure, which exhibit excellent performance. For instance, it was reported that 2D MOF nanosheets could expose more active surface sites than bulk MOFs.[14,15] Conductive MOFs and nanoscale MOFs were found possessing faster electronic transport capability.[16,17] Additionally, multimetallic MOFs exhibit an enhancement of catalytic activity in virtue of synergistic effect.[9,12,16,18] A class of surfacemounted MOF materials with high OER catalytic activity have also been reported.[19] These explorations drove MOF-based OER electrocatalysts further development. Nevertheless, it was found that acidic or alkaline solution enabled some unstable MOFs to exchange ligands with reactive molecules/ions.[20] Therefore, real active sites in MOFs materials and relevant OER mechanism still exist multiple possibility and uncertainty.

Inspired by these, Fe-MOFs@Ni-MOFs composites (FN-*n*, *n*…..) were prepared using octahedral Fe-MOFs and lamellar Ni-MOFs by ultrasonic method in the mixed solution of water and ethanol (This can be done while working electrodes are being prepared). The optimized FN-2 can be directly used as an electrode material and demonstrates superior OER performance with a low overpotential of 275 mV at 10 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> and satisfactory stability. Through analyzing those samples in different testing stages by ex situ transmission electron microscopic (TEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns, we found that most of ligands were replaced by hydroxyl ions in 1.0 m KOH solution, and the OER catalytic activity originated from NiFe-LDH, which was formed in situ mixing MOFs in KOH solution. This work combines the advantages of metal hydroxide and MOFs, and offers a brand-new view on following MOF materials as OER catalyst. More importantly, it provides the basic understanding of the reaction mechanism for MOFs as OER catalyst.

# **2. Results and Discussion**

### **2.1. Structural Characterization**

**Figure 1**a illustrates the preparation route of MOFs as OER catalyst. First, layered Ni-MOFs and octahedral Fe-MOFs were uniformly mixed by sonication in the mixture of ethanol and water at a specific mass ratio, the FN-*n* with Nafion solution was then directly dropped on the carbon paper as a working electrode, and it is expected to drive OER catalysis in 1.0 <sup>m</sup> KOH electrolyte. Specifically, the layered Ni-MOFs were successfully synthesized by mixed Ni2<sup>+</sup> and terephthalic acid in dimethylformamide (DMF) with the simple hydrothermal method. Figure S1 (Supporting Information) shows the XRD pattern of Ni-MOFs, all diffraction peaks are consistent with the reported crystal data (CCDC no. 638 866).[21] The scanning electronic microscope (SEM) image reveals the lamellar structure of Ni-MOFs (Figure 1b), and the formation of layered structure is attributed to the introduction of potassium hydroxide solution which accelerated the deprotonation of terephthalic acid. Similarly, the uniform octahedral Fe-MOFs (Figure 1c) were also prepared by mixed Fe3<sup>+</sup> and terephthalic acid in DMF, whose structure was further confirmed by XRD in Figure S1 in the Supporting Information.[22] The Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra of Ni-MOFs, Fe-MOFs, and FN-2 are shown in Figure S2 in the Supporting Information, three significant peaks at 3052, 3345, and 3429 cm<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> can be assigned to coordinated water molecules in Ni-MOFs, and the peak at 3590 cm<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> can be assigned the stretching vibrations of OH<sup>−</sup>. Meanwhile, two apparent peaks around 1385 and 1576 cm<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> correspond to the –COO− group in Ni-MOFs and Fe-MOFs, which are consistent with that reported previously.[21] All these results indicate the successful synthesis of Ni-MOFs and Fe-MOFs. After ultrasonic mixing, the uniform dispersion of FN-2 was achieved. The morphology and elemental composition of the FN-2 are provided in Figure 1d–g. As seen from Figure 1f,g, the laminated Ni-MOFs is uniformly wrapped on eight surfaces of Fe-MOFs. The uniform assembly of the two MOFs materials may be due to electrostatic interaction, in which the surface of Fe-MOFs has a positive charge (12.1 mV) and the surface of Ni-MOFs has a negative charge (−8.5 mV) (Figure S3, Supporting Information). The elemental mapping analysis also shows that the lamellar Ni-MOFs covered the octahedron Fe-MOFs.

#### 2.2. Electrochemical Measurements

The electrochemical performances of FN-2 were carried out at room temperature with a typical three-electrode system in 1.0 M KOH. For comparison, the electrocatalytic activity of Ni-MOFs, Fe-MOFs, carbon paper (CP), and commercial IrO<sub>2</sub> were tested under the same condition. When directly evaluated as OER catalysts, the FN-2, Ni-MOFs, and Fe-MOFs all exhibit competitive OER performance. Figure 2a shows the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves of samples, the FN-2 exhibits a smaller onset potential than other samples, followed by a faster current increase due to the oxygen evolution. Notably, a redox peak at around 1.37 V versus RHE in the LSV curve of Ni-MOFs can be attributed to the oxidation of Ni<sup>2+</sup> to Ni<sup>3+</sup>.<sup>[23]</sup> The overpotential at a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> is most commonly applied as a criterion for assessing OER catalytic activity.<sup>[24]</sup> In Figure 2b, the FN-2 exhibits the overpotentials of 275 and 316 mV at current densities of 10 and 50 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, respectively, which are obviously smaller than those of Ni-MOFs (361/451 mV), Fe-MOFs (405/464 mV), and commercial IrO<sub>2</sub> (385/485 mV). The FN-2 also exhibits a superb catalytic performance compared with other similar catalysts (Table S1, Supporting Information). The Tafel slope evolving from the LSV curves is essential to evaluate the kinetic properties of OER (Figure 2d). As expected, the lower Tafel slope (56.7 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>) of FN-2 is also lower than that of Ni-MOFs (120.1 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>), Fe-MOFs (84.8 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>), CP (201.0 mV  $dec^{-1}$ ), and commercial IrO<sub>2</sub> (147.8 mV  $dec^{-1}$ ). Above results demonstrate that Ni-MOFs has a smaller overpotential than Fe-MOFs, while Fe-MOFs shows better kinetic characteristics. The synergistic effect between the two MOFs make the FN-2 show the best catalytic activity.

In order to further determine the improved catalytic activity of the samples, the electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) of the catalyst can be represented by double layer capacitance (Cdl), which was calculated by CV test under different sweep scan rates (Figure S4, Supporting Information). As shown in Figure 2e, FN-2 exhibits a significant higher  $C_{d1}$  (32.3 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>) than that of Ni-MOFs (26.4 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>), Fe-MOFs (13.3 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>), CP (4.2 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>), and commercial IrO<sub>2</sub> (7.6 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>), suggesting more exposed active sites in FN-2. In addition, the abundance of active sites for FN-2 could attribute to the porous structure inherited from MOFs. It is worth noting that ECSA can evaluate the number of electrochemical active sites, but not all active sites are catalytic sites.<sup>[25]</sup> Therefore, in order to explore the intrinsic activity of the catalyst, we used ECSA value for normalizing the current density. After ECSA normalization, FN-2 still displays the lowest overpotential and Tafel slope (Figure 2c,f). It indicates the intrinsic optimization of electrochemical active sites of FN-2, which accelerate the OER process. In addition, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was recorded at overpotential of 330 mV from 100 kHz to 0.01 Hz. The charge transfer resistance of FN-2 is significantly lower than that of Ni-MOFs or Fe-MOFs, suggesting the favorable charge transport kinetics (Figure S5, Supporting Information).

The mass ratio (Ni-MOFs to Fe-MOFs) is one of the crucial factors on catalytic activity. The catalytic performance of FN-*n* was explored by optimizing the mass ratios (Ni-MOFs@Fe-MOFs). Figure S6 in the Supporting Information shows the SEM images of FN-*n* with various Ni-MOFs/Fe-MOFs mass ratios. Due to the differences in the morphology and specific surface area of Ni-MOFs and Fe-MOFs, the optimal load of Ni-MOFs nanosheets

**www.small-journal.com**

on octahedral Fe-MOFs is realized with the increase of *n*. When *n* = 2, the nanosheets and octahedron achieve relatively sufficient mixing. However, the *n* is too small for the nanosheets to cover every surface of the octahedrons adequately. On the contrary, if the *n* is too large, there would be extra nanosheets that are not coated on the octahedrons. Ulteriorly, the OER performance of FN-*n* was also tested, the FN-2 shows a better catalytic activity and higher active surface area (Figures S7 and S8, Supporting Information) than other samples.

### **2.3. Mechanism Research**

Attentively, Jin pointed out that transition metal compounds such as nitrides and phosphatides could be oxidized to oxides/ hydroxides under OER condition, and proved that the actual reactivity sites came from formed metal oxides/hydroxides on the surface.[26] This is especially proper for MOFs-based catalysts, which are more accessible to exchanging the ligands with reactive molecules/ions during OER reaction process.[20] It is reasonable to suppose that Fe-MOFs and Ni-MOFs in this work may endure necessary changes under alkaline conditions. Therefore, we also explored the source of the satisfactory catalytic activity of MOFs catalyst in our system. Various ex situ measurements were conducted to survey compositional and morphological changes of as-prepared MOFs in the 1.0 <sup>m</sup> KOH solution. **Figure 3** shows the SEM images of Ni-MOFs-i, Fe-MOFs-i, and FN-2i, which were placed on carbon paper working electrode and then soaked in the electrolyte for five minutes before the OER test. It indicates that the morphology of MOFs negligibly changed, and the lamellar structure of Ni-MOFs-i and octahedral structure of Fe-MOFs-i can be maintained (Figure 3a–c). Conceivably, the exchange of ligand and hydroxide in the electrolyte was confirmed by the analysis of UV absorption spectra of the electrolyte of the immersion FN-2 (Figure S9, Supporting Information). As shown in Figure S10 in the Supporting Information, after soaking in KOH solution, the FN-2 powder exhibits obvious peaks at 11.5°, 23.3°, 34.5°, and 60.3°, which can be assigned to NiFe-LDH, indicating that the vast majority of FN-2 are transformed to NiFe-LDH.[27] We did the same experiment for Ni-MOFs and Fe-MOFs as FN-2, and got a similar result (Figure S11, Supporting Information). Besides, the XRD patterns of FN-2i exhibits the peak at 9.2°, which belong to FN-2, further confirmation an incomplete transformation of FN-2 (Figure S12, Supporting Information). In Figure 3d,e, the TEM images of FN-2i demonstrated that the octahedron surface has visible lamellar structure, and becomes rougher. The highresolution TEM image indicates that there are intermittent lattice streaks on its surface (Figure 3f), the distinguished lattice stripe with the spacing of 0.40 nm can be assigned to the (006) plane of LDH structure. The magnified scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) image (Figure S13, Supporting Information) also confirms that the octahedron surface has many weeny flake structures. The TEM mapping indicated the uniformly distributed of Fe, Ni, C, and O in FN-2i (Figure S14, Supporting Information). All these results confirmed that in 1.0 m KOH solution, parts of carboxylic acid ligands in MOFs material are replaced by hydroxyl ions to form NiFe-LDH without morphological change. In addition, the high-resolution spectra of Ni 2p and Fe 2p (Figure S15, Supporting Information) show that the peak position of FN-2i has a significant negative shift compared with that of FN-2. The exchange of ligands leads to the direct connection between the metal atom and the oxygen atom, thus increasing the local electron density and reducing the binding energy.[28]

The LSV curves of FN-2 and FN-2i in CO2-saturated 0.5 <sup>m</sup> KHCO3 (pH = 7.04) were analyzed, confirming that the critical component for catalytic activity in the OER process is NiFe-LDH rather MOFs. As shown in Figure S16 in the Supporting Information, in terms of catalytic activity, the FN-2i shows significantly increased current density (9.3 mA cm−<sup>2</sup> ) compared

with the FN-2 (1.7 mA cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> ) at 1.7 V versus RHE and better dynamics under the same condition. This composite structure of FN-2i, which takes MOFs material as a template and obtained by partial ligands exchange, not only gives full play to the excellent framework structure of MOFs material, but also provides a carrier for the formed hydroxide to prevent its agglomeration, subsequently exposing more catalytic active sites. In addition, all these results confirm that the catalytic active sites located at NiFe-LDH derived from FN-2 materials in alkali instead of bulk MOFs.

Furthermore, the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to evaluate the valence state and component composition of samples. The high-resolution Ni 2p spectrum of FN-2i is shown in **Figure 4**a. Typically, the two peaks at 855.5 and 857.18 eV belong to the Ni 2P3/2, confirming the existence of Ni2<sup>+</sup> and Ni3<sup>+</sup>, respectively.[29] Naturally, occurring Ni3<sup>+</sup> may arise from crystalline and amorphous interfaces.[30] While the peak located at 873.37 eV can be assigned to Ni 2P1/2. The other two broad peaks centered at 861.53 and 879.51 eV corresponds to the satellite peaks of Ni 2P3/2 and Ni 2P1/2, respectively.[29] Furthermore, the high-resolution Fe 2p spectrum of FN-2i is shown in Figure 4b. Two peaks at 711.64 and 725.07 eV can be specified to Fe 2p3/2 and Fe 2p1/2, respectively. The presence of Fe3<sup>+</sup> is demonstrated by the peak of 719.90 eV. At the same time, the peak at 715.90 eV indicates that there is more than one coordination environment for Fe3<sup>+</sup>. [31] We compared the XPS spectra of Ni-MOFs-i, Fe-MOFs-i, and FN-2i to reveal the reason of FN-2i with best catalytic activity of all. Interestingly, compared with the Ni 2p3/2 peak (855.83 eV) of Ni-MOFs-i and the Fe 2p3/2 peak (711.23 eV) of Fe-MOFs-i, the peak positions of FN-2i shift to lower and higher binding energies (Ni 2p3/2 at 855.51 eV and Fe 2p3/2 at 711.64 eV), respectively. It suggests that the synergistic effects between two metals occurs when NiFe-LDH are formed.[14,32]

To assess the long-term stability, FN-2 catalyst was tested at a constant applied potential of 1.52 V versus RHE. As shown in **Figure 5**a, a constant current density of 10 mA cm−<sup>2</sup> remains unchanged under the operating conditions for 100 h.

**Figure 5.** Chronopotentiometry curve of a) FN-2 and b) LSV curve after continuous electrolysis 100 h. c) TEM images and TEM mapping of FN-2 after OER testing for 1000 CV cycles.

Meanwhile, the LSV curve barely change after 100 hours of i–t test for the FN-2 (Figure 5b), further indicating its excellent cyclic stability. Ulteriorly, the XPS of Ni 2p and Fe 2p after 1000 cycles of CV also have proper maintenance (Figure S17, Supporting Information), indicating its outstanding sustainability achieved from the formation of NiFe-LDH. Figure 5c shows the TEM image and TEM mapping after 1000 cycles with no obvious change in its morphology and component distribution.

In general, the enhanced catalytic activity of FN-2 can be attributed to its fantastic experience in KOH solution, which triggered unique structural characteristics and synergistic effects of active components. First, the obtained low-crystalline NiFe-LDH sheets induce increasable catalytic surface area and rich defects, and these defects are usually considered as potential active sites, thereby enhancing catalytic activity.<sup>[33]</sup> Second, the morphology of FN-2 also plays a significant role in inhibiting their aggregation during the cyclic process. Third, NiFe-LDH possesses better electrical conductivity than Ni or Fe LDH, thus accelerating electron transport. Lastly, the coordination effect between Ni and Fe optimizes the electronic structure of FN-2i and promotes the catalytic process. Benefiting from the above advantages, the as-prepared FN-2 shows satisfactory catalytic activity and cyclic stability.

#### 3. Conclusion

In summary, an integrated FN-2 electrocatalyst was assembled via mixing lamellar Ni-MOFs and octahedral Fe-MOFs, and directly acted as high-performance OER catalyst in 1.0 m KOH. The NiFe-LDH was detected since part of the ligands in the MOFs was exchanged with hydroxyl ions, which was considered as the active species in the catalytic reaction. Meanwhile, the unique structural characteristics of FN-2 and the synergistic effect between Ni and Fe also lead to satisfactory overpotential and cyclic stability. This work contributes to our further understanding of the active sites and the reaction mechanism of MOFs in oxygen evolution reaction, and may provide a universal route towards design and fabrication of MOF-based electrocatalysts.

#### 4. Experimental Section

Synthesis of Ni-MOFs: Ni-MOFs were prepared by the previously reported work with minor modification. [21] In a typical synthesis, 2 mmol terephthalic acid (0.332 g) and 0.65 mmol Ni(NO<sub>3</sub>) $_2$ -6H $_2$ O (0.190 g) were dissolved in turn in 40 mL N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) with constant stirring at room temperature. Then, 4 mL of KOH (0.4 m) was added into the above solution drop by drop and continue stirring for 30 min. The solution was finally heated in an autoclave at 100 °C for 8 h. The collected products were washed several times with DMF and ethanol, and dried at 60 °C in vacuum overnight.

Synthesis of Fe-MOFs: Briefly, 2.5 mmol terephthalic acid (0.415 g) and 4.9 mmol FeCl $_3$ -6H $_2$ O (1.324 g) were dissolved in turn in 60 mL DMF with constant stirring at room temperature for 30 min. The solution was finally heated in an autoclave at 110 °C for 20 h. The collected products were washed several times with DMF and ethanol and dried at 60 °C in vacuum overnight. [22]

Preparation of FN-n (n = 1, 2, 3, 4): The preparation of the FN-n is realized in the process of electrode preparation without Nafion solution.

Briefly, Fe-MOFs and Ni-MOFs (m/m=3:7, FN-2) were dispersed in a mixed solution of distilled water and ethanol for 30 min sonication with 40 KHz ultrasonic frequency and 150 W ultrasonic power. For comparison, other samples were prepared with different mass ratios (Fe-MOFs: Ni-MOFs = 1:9, 5:5, 7:3) were denoted as FN-1, FN-3, FN-4, respectively. In addition, the mixture of Fe-MOFs and Ni-MOFs with different mass ratio were prepared by physical grinding was labeled as FN-n-P (n=1, 2, 3, 3) and 4).

Material Characterizations: Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns were collected by a Rigaku MiniFlex600. Field emission scanning electronic microscope (FE-SEM, JSM-7500F) and TEM (JEM-2800) equipped with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) mapping was used to identify the morphologies and sizes of the samples. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed on a PHI5000 Versaprobe system. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra of the samples were obtained with an FT-IR spectrometer (TENSOR 37). The absorbance spectra were obtained on a UV-vis spectrophotometer (UV-2600). Zeta potential test was performed on an Anton paar (Litesizer 500) system at 25 °C.

Preparation of Electrode: In order to obtain a catalyst ink, 5 mg of samples (Ni-MOFs, Fe-MOFs, or FN-n-P) powder and 20 μL Nafion solution (5.0 wt%) were dispersed in a mixed solution of 0.3 mL distilled water and 0.18 mL ethanol with a 30 min sonication. Then, the catalyst ink was coated onto a CP, the loading of catalyst was ordered to be 1 mg cm<sup>-2</sup>. In addition, the electrodes by placing the prepared CP working electrode (Ni-MOFs, Fe-MOFs, and FN-2) directly into the electrolyte for a few minutes before the OER tested was denoted as Ni-MOFs-i, Fe-MOFs-i, and FN-2i, respectively.

Electrochemical Measurements: All electrochemical performances were carried out at room temperature with a typical three-electrode system (Chenhua, CHI-760E). The catalyst-modified CP was used as the working electrode, Ag/AgCl (1.0  $\,\rm m$  KCl) and Pt plate (1  $\times$  2 cm) were used as the reference electrode and counter electrode, respectively. The OER tests were performed in O $_2$  saturated 1.0  $\,\rm m$  KOH (pH = 14.04) solution. All of the test data in polarization curves were iR-corrected and transformed to the RHE standard as reported previously, and the compensation level is 95%. The ECSA and the normalized current density were computed according to the equation

$$ECSA = \frac{C_{dl-samples}}{C_{dl-carbon paper}}$$

$$j_{ECSA-Normalized} = \frac{j}{ECSA}$$

Where  $C_{\rm dl}$  is double layer capacitance, which was calculated by CV test under different sweep scan rates, and i is current density.

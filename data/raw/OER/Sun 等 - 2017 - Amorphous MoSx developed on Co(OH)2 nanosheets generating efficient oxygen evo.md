#### **Abstract**

Exploring high-efficient and inexpensive electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is of great importance to design renewable energy storage and conversion devices. Herein, we prepare amorphous MoS<sub>x</sub> encapsulated Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> nanosheets (aMoS<sub>x</sub>/Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> NSs) as strongly robust and active OER electrocatalysts via three-step procedures: Firstly, Co(OH)2 nanosheets with catalytic-active octahedral MO<sub>6</sub> structures are synthesized by hydrothermal process; Secondly, violent ultrasonication is applied to exfoliate individual nanosheets from stacked Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> sheets, and break down into smaller ones and attach MoS<sub>4</sub><sup>2</sup>- ions uniformly on nanosheets; Thirdly, MoS<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> ions are thermally decomposed into amorphous MoS<sub>x</sub> on Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> nanosheets. The role of incorporation of the amorphous MoS<sub>x</sub> nanostructure is to enhance the surface hydrophilicity for availability of H<sub>2</sub>O and to accelerate the electron transport capability for kinetic activities. Furthermore, the interaction between MoS<sub>x</sub> and Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> is proposed to induce the electron transfer from amorphous MoS<sub>x</sub> to Co(OH)<sub>2</sub>, which will promote the basic environment for cobalt sites, break the Co-O bond, favor for the release of O2 molecules, and thus enhance the OER process. Optimization of Co/Mo mole ratio demonstrates that aMoS<sub>x</sub>/Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> NSs with Co/Mo mole ratio of 8 perform the best OER activity and deliver the overpotential of 350 mV at current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> and Tafel slope of 65.4 mV dec<sup>-1</sup> in 0.1 M KOH. This study enriches the researches on non-first-row (3d) metal incorporation for high-efficient OER catalysts and offers alternative substitute for noble metal catalysts.

#### 1. Introduction

One of the most critical challenges for modern society is evolving unsustainable and polluting fossil fuel to renewable clean energy and developing efficient energy storage and conversion devices. <sup>1-3</sup> The electrochemical splitting of water with zero carbon emission is an ideal route to convert electric energy into chemical energy by generating oxygen and clean sustainable hydrogen fuels, which could meet the above requirements. <sup>4,5</sup> However, the stepwise oxidation of water into oxygen at the anode, which suffers from a complex kinetically sluggish four-electron process, requires large overpotential ( $\eta$ ) with distinct energy loss impeding the practical application. <sup>6,7</sup> Up to date, the OER electrocatalysts widely used are Ru- and Ir-based compounds composed of noble metal elements. Unfortunately, the large-scale application of noble metal electrocatalysts suffers from reserve scarcity and high cost. <sup>8,9</sup> So there are tremendous interests to develop strongly robust and active OER catalysts with earth-abundant and cost-efficient materials.

Besides molecular complexes and perovskite (general formula ABO<sub>3-\(\delta\)</sub>), 10,11 earth-abundant first-row (3d) transition metal materials as high-performance OER alternative electrocatalysts have attracted much attention, especially in the forms of metal oxides (hydroxides), 7,9,12-14 nitrides, 15,16 phosphides, 17 borides chalcogenides. 18-23 It has been reported that OER activity of single first-row (3d) transition metal materials can be significantly promoted by doping ions and/or hybridizing with supports or other functional composition. 19,24-31 In previous studies, more attention has been paid on the doping or hybridizing with first-row (3d) transition metal materials. For instance, we and others have synthesized Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> nanosheets, Mn<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/CoSe<sub>2</sub> hybrid and Co-doped NiSe<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles film which show the improved catalytic properties towards OER process. 19,25,26 Besides, there are some reports describing the modification of non-first-row transition metal materials for designing strongly robust and active OER catalysts.<sup>27-31</sup> Sargent and Yang reported the homogeneously dispersing of tungsten (W) and molybdenum (Mo) into FeCo (oxy)hydroxides can modulate the electronic structure of 3dtransition metals and thus boost the water oxidation reaction. 29,30 Li designed

FeOOH/CeO2 heterolayered nanotubes as electrocatalysts with strong electronic interactions for promoting OER performances.<sup>31</sup> Notwithstanding dopants of non-first-row (3d) transition metal hybrids have shown impressive effect on vigorous electrochemical water oxidation, there are still less researches reported and the related in-depth studies are urgent to be explored.

Cobalt hydroxides, which are in stoichiometric layered configuration containing cationic brucite-like layers, possess promising electrochemical applications such as electrochemical capacitors and alkaline secondary batteries.32-35 As for OER, Co(OH)2 has exerted promising catalytic activity probably due to the divalent cobalt cations occupying alternate rows of octahedral sites, which is consistent with previous reports that edge-sharing octahedral MO<sub>6</sub> layers in 2D transition metal oxides/hydroxides are very active for OER. 13,36,37 However, poor OER kinetics and mass-transfer ability still hind the catalytic performance of Co(OH)<sub>2</sub>. To address this issue, the effective strategy of doping with non-first-row (3d) transition metal hybrids could be explored. It is well known that amorphous materials are in disordered structure and hold great promise in catalysis and energy storage.<sup>38</sup> Amorphous MoS<sub>x</sub> has been applied for HER and sodium-ion batteries, and its amorphous nature enables the rich defect sites to absorb reactants and lower energy barriers during the possible structural rearrangement and conversion process. 38,39 Therefore, it is expected that after the incorporation of amorphous MoS<sub>x</sub> onto Co(OH)<sub>2</sub>, the MoS<sub>x</sub> may play a positive role for enhancing OER catalytic activity of Co(OH)<sub>2</sub>.

Herein, we encapsulate amorphous MoS<sub>x</sub> on the surface of Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> nanosheets by solvothermal treatment to synthesize efficient OER electrocatalysts with two-dimensional structure, i.e. aMoS<sub>x</sub>/Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> NSs. The relatively open two-dimensional layered structure, which ensures the rapid proton-coupled electron transfer and fast diffusion paths for reactants or/and products, contributes to its superior electrochemical performance. 40 After incorporating amorphous MoS<sub>x</sub>, the enhanced surface hydrophilicity benefits the availability of H<sub>2</sub>O and the accelerated electron transport capability boosts kinetic activities for OER process. In addition, it is proposed that the electron transfer from amorphous MoS<sub>x</sub> to Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> benefits the OER process by promoting the basic environment for cobalt sites and the breaking of the Co-O bond in the intermediate, which is beneficial for OER process. Screening a wide Co/Mo mole ratio range with results demonstrated that aMoS<sub>x</sub>/Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> NSs with Co/Mo mole ratio of 8 (also Co/Mo 8) exhibit best OER electrocatalytic activity with overpotential of 350 mV at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> and Tafel slope of 65.4 mV dec<sup>-1</sup> in 0.1 M KOH on a loading of 0.2 mg cm<sup>-2</sup>. At the same time, the OER catalyst could maintain stable for 3000 cycles with no obvious degradation. This strategy about strengthening catalytic activity by non-first-row transition metal incorporation could be applied to other system for developing highly efficient OER electrocatalysts.

#### 2. Experimental Section

#### 2.1. Preparation of aMoS<sub>x</sub>/Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> NSs

Preparation of Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> NSs. Cobalt(II) nitrate hexahydrate (Co(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>•6H<sub>2</sub>O, 1.164 g, 4 mmol), and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP, 0.200 g, MW=10 000) were dissolved in 25 mL of deionized water to obtain a pink solution with stirring. Then 8 mL of 80 wt% hydrazine hydrate (N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>•H<sub>2</sub>O) was added dropwise to the above solution under stirring. After stirring constantly for 30 min, the mixture was transferred into a 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave, kept at 160 °C for 18 h, and then allowed to cool to room temperature naturally. The pink powders were

Preparation of  $aMoS_x/Co(OH)_2$  NSs with Co/Mo mole ratio to be 8. In a typical synthesis, as-prepared Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> (15 mg) and ammonium tetrathiomolybdate  $((NH_4)_2MoS_4,$ 5.2 mg, 0.02mmol) were dispersed into N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF). After ultrasonication for 90 min, 50 μL of 80 wt% hydrazine hydrate was added to the above suspension with stirring. After stirring vigorously for 30 min, the mixture was transferred into a 25 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave, kept at 200 °C for 15 h, and then allowed to cool to room temperature naturally. The black products were separated by centrifugation at 6000 rpm and washed several times with deionized water and ethanol, followed by drying at 60 °C for overnight. aMoS<sub>x</sub>/Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> NSs with Co/Mo mole ratio of 8 were obtained.

Preparation of  $aMoS_y/Co(OH)_2$  NSs with other Co/Mo mole ratio. aMoS<sub>x</sub>/Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> NSs with Co/Mo mole ratio of 2, 4, 16 and 24 were obtained with the same process except ammonium tetrathiomolybdate of 20.8, 10.4, 2.6 and 1.3 mg, and amorphous MoS<sub>x</sub> (aMoS<sub>x</sub>) was also obtained without addition of as-prepared Co(OH)<sub>2</sub>.

Preparation of  $aMoS_x/Co(OH)_2$  NSs without ultrasonication process. The non-ultrasonicating aMoS<sub>x</sub>/Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> NSs (Co/Mo 8) were synthesized by the same procedure as the normal aMoS<sub>x</sub>/Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> NSs (Co/Mo 8) catalyst except the stirring instead of ultrasonication process to disperse (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>MoS<sub>4</sub> and Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> NSs in DMF.

Preparation of aMoO<sub>x</sub>/Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> NSs using different Mo precursor. Composites without S element anticipation were obtained by the same process except thermal deposition of ammonium molybdate ((NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>6</sub>Mo<sub>7</sub>O<sub>24</sub>, 3.5 mg) in water instead of ammonium tetrathiomolybdate in DMF, marked as aMoO<sub>x</sub>/Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> NSs (Co/Mo 8).

#### 2.3. Structural Characterization

field-emission The scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) analyses were conducted on a Hitch SU8010 SEM. Microstructures of the samples were further characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-1200EX), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, 200 kV) and selected-area electron diffraction (SAED). X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) was carried out on a Bruker D8 advance power diffractometer with Cu K $\alpha$  radiation ( $\lambda$  = 1.5418 Å). The X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were recorded on an ESCALab 250 X-ray photoelectron spectrometer using monochromated Al K $\alpha$  radiation exciting source. The binding energies achieved in the XPS spectral analysis were corrected for specimen charging by referencing C 1s to 284.5 eV. Raman spectra were taken on a RENISHAW inVia instrument using an excitation wavelength of 632 nm. Fourier transformed infrared (FTIR) spectra were recorded on TENSOR-27 (Bruker).

#### 2.4. Electrocatalytic Measurements

Electrochemical measurements were carried out using a CHI 760E electrochemical workstation (Shanghai Chenhua Instrument Co. Ltd.) with a conventional three-electrode system, in which the modified glassy carbon (GC) electrodes were used as the working electrode, platinum wire as the auxiliary electrode, and Ag/AgCl (KCl-saturated) as the reference electrode. The iR drops from the solution resistance during experiments were corrected. The working electrode was a thin layer of Nafion-impregnated catalyst cast on a glassy carton rotating disk electrode (GC-RDE, 4 mm diameter,  $0.1256~\rm cm^2$ ) as detailed in the following: a catalyst slurry was first prepared by mixing 2.5 mg of catalyst, 730  $\mu$ L of water, 250  $\mu$ L of ethanol and 20  $\mu$ L of Nafion. After ultrasonication for 30 min, 10  $\mu$ L of this ink was transferred onto a freshly polished GC-RDE via a pipette, with a constant catalyst loading of 0.2 mg cm<sup>-2</sup>. Finally, the as-prepared catalyst film was dried at room temperature. All of the potentials were calibrated to a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) according to the Nernst equation. All electrochemical measurements were performed at room temperature.

The polarization curves were recorded by sweeping the potential from 0 to 1 V vs Ag/AgCl with the scan rate of 5 mV s<sup>-1</sup> in 0.1 M KOH, and in the meanwhile, GC-RDE was controlled at 1600 rpm by a speed regulator (ALS, Japan). The working

electrode was activated for several times until the signals were stable. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were carried out by applying an alternating current (AC) voltage with 5 mV amplitude in a frequency range from 100 KHz to 100 mHz at a potential of 1.7 V vs RHE without iR drops in 0.1 M KOH solution. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) cycling test was conducted at a sweep rate of 100 mV s<sup>-1</sup> for 3000 cycles, and the resulting polarization curves were recorded at a sweep rate of 5 mV s<sup>-1</sup>.

Details concerning the calculation of mass activity and turnover frequency (TOF) are shown below:

The values of mass activity (A g-1) were calculated from the catalyst loading m (0.2 mg cm<sup>-2</sup>) and the measured current density j (mA cm<sup>-2</sup>) at  $\eta$ =0.35 V:

Mass activity = 
$$\frac{j}{m}$$

The values of TOF were calculated by assuming that every metal atom is involved in the catalysis (lower TOF limits were calculated):

$$TOF = \frac{j \times S}{4 \times F \times n}$$

Here, i (mA cm<sup>-2</sup>) is the measured current density at  $\eta$ =0.35 V, S (0.1256 cm<sup>2</sup>) is the surface area of glassy carbon disk, the number 4 means 4 electrons per mole of  $O_2$ , F is Faraday's constant (96 485.3 C mol<sup>-1</sup>), and n is the moles of coated metal atom on the electrode calculated from m and the molecular weight of the coated catalysts.

#### 3. Results and Discussion

Two-dimensional aMoS<sub>x</sub>/Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> NSs are synthesized successfully via three-step procedures including two-step thermal process and one-step ultrasonication process. As the schematic illustration shown in **Scheme 1**, firstly, Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> NSs with edge-sharing octahedral MO<sub>6</sub> layers structure holding promising OER activity are fabricated by hydrothermal process. In the following step of intense ultrasonic treatment, stacked hexagonal Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> NSs with large size are broken into smaller pieces, which can expose more contact areas with electrolyte and accelerate diffusion of reactants or/and products to expedite OER procedure. Meanwhile, ultrasonic treatment can effectively boost  $MoS_4^{2-}$  ions anchoring to the surface of  $Co(OH)_2$  NSs. In the last step,  $MoS_4^{2-}$  ions are thermal decomposed into amorphous  $MoS_x$  on the surface of  $Co(OH)_2$  NSs by solvothermal process, and finally two-dimensional  $aMoS_x/Co(OH)_2$  NSs are synthesized. Detailed information of synthesis process is shown on the experimental section. Particularly, due to the best catalytic activity among all designed catalysts, more attention was paid to  $aMoS_x/Co(OH)_2$  NSs (Co/Mo~8) in the following study.

#### 3.1. Morphology and Structure Characterization of aMoS<sub>x</sub>/Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> NSs

Firstly, morphologies and structures of aMoS<sub>x</sub>/Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> NSs (Co/Mo 8) were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) shown in Fig. 1 and the corresponding characterizations of pristine Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> NSs are shown in Fig. S1. It is clear that the as-prepared Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> NSs are in obvious hexagonal shape with each side to be about 8 µm and many sheets are stacked together, which hinders the contact with electrolytes. As comparison, the aMoS<sub>x</sub>/Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> NSs (Co/Mo 8) dispersed well in lamellar structures with smaller size in micron level, as observed in Fig. 1a and b. It is attributed to the assist of violent ultrasonication during which the stacked large sheets are broken into relatively dispersed smaller sheets with more surface areas exposed, which greatly increases the number of active octahedral MO<sub>6</sub> sites and facilitates the electrolytes diffusion and proton-coupled electron transfer for OER. The thickness of single Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> sheet is estimated to be 40 nm from SEM image in Fig. S1b, while the thickness of aMoS<sub>x</sub>/Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> NSs (Co/Mo 8) is about 70 nm in **Fig. 1b**. In addition, the height profiles in Fig. S2 derived from atomic force microscopy (AFM) images show the similar results of SEM. By comparing the thickness of Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> NSs and aMoS<sub>x</sub>/Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> NSs (Co/Mo 8), it can be speculated that out-of-flatness amorphous MoS<sub>x</sub> in nanostructure are successfully encapsulated on Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> nanosheets through solvothermal process.

Fig. 1 a) and b) High-magnification SEM images, c) TEM image, d) HRTEM image, e) SAED pattern, f) EDS spectrum, and g) mapping images of aMoS<sub>x</sub>/Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> NSs (Co/Mo 8).

The high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) image in Fig. S1 confirm the formation of single Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> in obvious crystal character. As for aMoS<sub>x</sub>/Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> NSs (Co/Mo 8), the only lattice spacing of 0.27 nm in HRTEM image (Fig. 1d) could be indexed to the (100) plane of Co(OH)<sub>2</sub>, and SAED image (Fig. 1e) shows the only (100) diffraction plane of Co(OH)<sub>2</sub>. No crystal plane of MoS<sub>x</sub> is observed. These results from HRTEM and SAED images indicate that Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> remains crystal structure and the MoS<sub>x</sub> developed on aMoS<sub>x</sub>/Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> NSs (Co/Mo 8) is in the form of amorphous structure. Moreover, energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) analysis is carried out in Fig. 1f to evaluate the element composition and shows the presence of O, S, Co, and Mo elements. Further information about spatial distribution of elements of aMoS<sub>x</sub>/Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> NSs (Co/Mo 8) is obtained from elemental mapping images in **Fig.** 

**1g**. It is clear that the elements distribute uniformly on the nanosheets, indicating that amorphous MoS<sub>x</sub> is successfully and uniformly developed on Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> NSs. The amorphous MoS<sub>x</sub> possesses the nature of disorder structure, which enables lower energy barriers towards the possible structural rearrangement and conversion process.<sup>38</sup> Moreover, the Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> NSs show the larger water contact angles (36.5°, Fig. S3a), whereas aMoS<sub>x</sub>/Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> NSs show the smaller water contact angles (32.4°, Fig. S3b), which confirm the increased hydrophilicity after the incorporation of amorphous MoS<sub>x</sub> nanostructure. This indicates that the presence of MoS<sub>x</sub> is useful for availability of H<sub>2</sub>O, which is beneficial for OER process.<sup>41</sup>

Typical X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of  $Co(OH)_2$  NSs and  $aMoS_x/Co(OH)_2$  NSs (Co/Mo 8) are shown in **Fig. 2a**.  $Co(OH)_2$  NSs can be well indexed into β-Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> (PDF#74-1057) (space group P-3m1 (164)) phase with hexagonal structure,<sup>32</sup> and the atom configuration of  $Co(OH)_2$  is shown in Fig. S4. After hybridization, the  $aMoS_x/Co(OH)_2$  NSs (Co/Mo 8) show no obvious diffraction peaks indicating the poor crystal structure of  $MoS_x$ , which is consistent with SAED and HRTEM results.

To further confirm the surface electronic states and the chemical composition of the aMoS<sub>x</sub>/Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> NSs (Co/Mo 8), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements are recorded in Fig. 2b. According to the analysis results of XPS, the survey spectra of aMoS<sub>x</sub>/Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> NSs (Co/Mo 8) demonstrate that the Co, Mo, O, and S elements are the main components further manifesting the successful development of amorphous MoS<sub>x</sub> on Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> nanosheets. The molar ratio of Co/Mo calculating from XPS results is 7.49, which is close to 8 of Co/Mo mole ratio in the typical synthesis process. In addition, the molar ratio of Mo/S is 2.73 indicating the presence of unsaturated sites. The high resolution spectra of Co 2p, Mo 3d, O 1s, and S 2p are presented in Fig. 2c-f, respectively. Co 2p spectrum of aMoS<sub>x</sub>/Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> NSs (Co/Mo 8) illustrates typical 2p<sub>1/2</sub> and 2p<sub>3/2</sub> components due to spin-orbit splitting around 797.36 and 781.40 eV, respectively, and these peaks are characteristic of the Co<sup>2+</sup> oxidation state. 42 Obviously, the electron binding energy for high resolution Co 2p spectrum of aMoS<sub>x</sub>/Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> NSs (Co/Mo 8) shows a ~0.8 eV down-shift compared with pure Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> NS in Fig. S5. In addition, it is proposed that this difference of electron binding energy is due to the electron transfer behavior from  $MoS_x$  to  $Co(OH)_2$  inducing the relatively lower oxidation state of cobalt atoms. According to previous studies, the electron transfer from MoS<sub>x</sub> to Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> will make MoS<sub>x</sub> more acidic (Lewis acid) leading to the more bonds with surface hydroxyls (Lewis base).  $^{25,43}$  Therefore, the introduction of  $MoS_x$  will promote the beneficial basic environment for cobalt sites to improve catalytic activity. For the Mo 3d, the peaks located at 232.6 and 235.7 eV are attributed to the Mo(VI) 3d<sub>5/2</sub> and 3d<sub>3/2</sub> indicating Mo in +6 oxidation state (Fig. 2d), while weak peaks of Mo(IV) signals locating at 229.5 and 232.6 eV can be assigned into Mo(IV) 3d<sub>5/2</sub> and 3d<sub>3/2</sub>.8 To be specific, the fitting areas of +6 and +4 oxidation state are integrated to be 92.5% and 7.5%, respectively, suggesting that molybdenum is mainly in highest valence. In addition, the presence of Mo(IV) indicates there might be some MoS<sub>2</sub> in MoS<sub>x</sub>. In O 1s spectrum (Fig. 2e) of aMoS<sub>x</sub>/Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> NSs (Co/Mo 8), four peaks can be fitted in 530.0, 531.2, 531.5, and 532.1 eV corresponding to the lattice O, lattice OH,  $SO_4^{2-}$ , and absorbed H<sub>2</sub>O, respectively. 44 Besides, aMoS<sub>x</sub>/Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> NSs (Co/Mo 8) contain  $S^{2-}$  atoms with electron bond energy signals at 163.50/164.70 and 162.11/163.31 eV, respectively (two sets of doublets). The higher bond energy signals are related to bridging  $S_2^{2-}$  and apical  $S^{2-}$ , while the lower bond energy signals are related to unsaturated  $S^{2-}$  and terminal  $S_2^{2-.45}$  The fitting areas of S atoms confirm the rich unsaturated sites in  $MoS_x$  nanostructure, which is in coincidence with amorphous nature, and these unsaturated sites can act as active areas to absorb reactant. Besides, the peak at 169.3 eV of S 2p spectrum is assigned to  $S^{6+}$ , which is due to the formation of  $SO_4^{2-}$  with the oxidation of S atoms. The  $SO_4^{2-}$  has been reported to enhance surface hydrophilicity, which will contribute to facilitate the contact of electrolyte and electrode material in favor of OER process.

Furthermore, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrum and Raman spectroscopy are further applied to characterize the structures of Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> NSs and aMoS<sub>x</sub>/Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> NSs. As shown in **Fig. 3a**, the FI-IR spectrum of the Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> NSs displays the same pattern with the previous report with the sharp peak at 3630 cm<sup>-1</sup> assigned to free hydroxyl group and the peak at 490 cm<sup>-1</sup> assigned to metal–OH bending vibrations and metal–oxygen vibrations in brucite structure.<sup>47</sup> As for aMoS<sub>x</sub>/Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> NSs, the peak of hydroxyl group becomes wide and dispersed due to the decrease of free O-H. The obvious new peak at 1110 cm<sup>-1</sup> originates from the asymmetric stretch of surface undistorted tetrahedral SO<sub>4</sub>,<sup>48</sup> which is previously

As is reported, the composition can significantly affect the oxygen evolution activity of catalysts. 24, 43 Therefore, a series of samples with different feeding molar ratio of Co/Mo ranging from 2 to 24, namely Co/Mo n (n=2, 4, 8, 16, 24), are synthesized to explore the influence of Mo content towards OER activity. Before electrochemical measurements, the corresponding SEM images of aMoS<sub>x</sub>/Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> NSs with different Co/Mo molar ratio are shown in Fig. S6 and it can be seen that aMoS<sub>x</sub>/Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> NSs possess similar morphology and structure. Besides, the Co and Mo atom percentages of as-prepared aMoS<sub>x</sub>/Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> NSs have also been quantitatively measured by EDS (Table S1). The results show that the molar ratios of Co/Mo are close to stoichiometry used in the corresponding solution. The electrochemical characterization of aMoS<sub>x</sub>/Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> NSs with different Co/Mo molar ratio as electrocatalysts for OER is carried out in a typical three-electrode setup. Rotating disk electrode modified with catalysts is applied as working electrode. To this end, catalysts were dispersed onto RDE at a uniform loading of 0.2 mg cm<sup>-2</sup> for lines sweep voltammetry (LSV) measurement in alkaline media (0.1 M KOH) (see

Experiment Section for details). Then the polarization curves were measured with iR compensation at a scan rate of 5 mV s $^{-1}$ .

The polarization curves in **Fig. 4a** show that after incorporating amorphous  $MoS_x$ ,  $aMoS_x/Co(OH)_2$  NSs perform the better OER performances than pure  $Co(OH)_2$  NSs, and the OER onset potential possesses a cathodic shift, which indicates the decrease in reaction energy for water oxidation into oxygen. When the molar ratio of Co/Mo was controlled to be 8:1,  $aMoS_x/Co(OH)_2$  NSs exhibit the lowest onset potential (1.52 V vs RHE) and highest catalytic current density. Remarkably, the current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, a metric relevant to solar fuel synthesis, <sup>53</sup> can be achieved at small overpotential ( $\eta$ ) of ~ 350 mV for the  $aMoS_x/Co(OH)_2$  NSs (Co/Mo 8), smaller than or comparable to well-studied non-noble metal OER catalysts including carbon-based and layer double hydroxide (LDH) materials (**Table 1**). In addition, the electrocatalytic activities of pure amorphous  $MoS_x$  are very poor, which will not be further discussed. Among all catalysts, in **Fig. 4a** insert image,  $aMoS_x/Co(OH)_2$  NSs (Co/Mo 8) present highest oxidation peak at 1.1-1.2 V assigned

to the Co3+/Co2+ redox process, demonstrating the maximum active cobalt ions available, while Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> NSs present lowest oxidation peak demonstrating the minimum active cobalt ions available.<sup>54</sup> Moreover, as shown in Fig. 4a, aMoS<sub>x</sub>/Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> NSs (Co/Mo 8) show the higher catalytic current density than commercial RuO<sub>2</sub> catalysts, suggesting an excellent OER activity. To better understand the reaction kinetics of the electrodes, corresponding Tafel slopes are obtained from the polarization curves, as shown in Fig. 4b. Obviously, the aMoS<sub>x</sub>/Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> NSs (Co/Mo 8) possess the lowest slope value of 65.4 mV dec<sup>-1</sup> compared with other catalysts, which indicates that the catalytic behavior of  $aMoS_x/Co(OH)_2$  NSs (Co/Mo 8) is more favorable.

Assuming all the metal cobalt sites are electrochemically active and can act as reaction sites for OER, mass activity (MA) and turnover frequency (TOF) are also calculated at an overpotential of 350 mV in 0.1 M KOH, as illustrated in Fig. 4 c and

d. aMoS<sub>x</sub>/Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> NSs (Co/Mo 8) show the highest values of 50 A g<sup>-1</sup> and 0.0210 s<sup>-1</sup> for MA and TOF, which are 22 and 5.3 fold larger than Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> NSs, respectively. The improved TOF values of all aMoS<sub>x</sub>/Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> NSs catalysts reveal the strengthened catalytic activity for cobalt atoms in Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> NSs due to the incorporation of molybdenum sulfide. It is worth noting that calculated TOFs are in lower limits since not all cobalt sites are electrochemically available. Above electrochemical parameters are summarized in Table 2 and these results confirm the high-active catalytic performance of aMoS<sub>x</sub>/Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> NSs (Co/Mo 8). In addition, it can been seen in Fig. 4e that aMoS<sub>x</sub>/Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> NSs (Co/Mo 8) will reach the current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> at lower overpotential of 330 mV in 1 M KOH, and as shown in Fig. 4f, the aMoS<sub>x</sub>/Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> NSs (Co/Mo 8) displayed negligible degeneration of current density after 3000 CV cycling tests.

To further study the relations between catalytic performance and Mo content, more measurements are performed. Electrochemical surface area (ECSA) is a very

important factor affecting catalystic performance in water oxidation reaction. The ECSAs of aMoS<sub>x</sub>/Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> NSs with different Mo content were further estimated from the electrochemical double-layer capacitance ( $C_{\rm dl}$ ) at the solid-liquid interface, as shown in Fig. 5. aMoS<sub>x</sub>/Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> NSs (Co/Mo 8) perform the largest  $2C_{dl}$  of 0.251 mF cm<sup>-2</sup> among all catalysts containing amorphous MoS<sub>x</sub>, and it indicates that aMoS<sub>x</sub>/Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> (Co/Mo 8) NSs possess more electroactive areas available for oxygen evolution reaction. It should be noted that pure  $Co(OH)_2$  NSs hold larger  $C_{dl}$ value than aMoS<sub>x</sub>/Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> NSs, but perform relatively poor OER activities. The higher turnover frequency and larger quantity of active cobalt atoms for OER located on aMoS<sub>x</sub>/Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> NSs are believed to lead to the enhanced catalytic performance. Moreover, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analyses were performed to study the reaction kinetics of these all catalysts, and the corresponding Nyquist plots are presented in Fig. 5d. The aMoS<sub>x</sub>/Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> NSs electrodes show similar series resistance, mainly originating from the solution resistance  $(R_s)$ , and this suggests the consistent experimental confiuration. The charge transfer resistance  $(R_{ct})$  reveals the reaction kinetic activities of different electrodes: a lower charge transfer resistance value represents a faster kinetic reaction. 58 Compared with the Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> NSs electrode, the aMoS<sub>x</sub>/Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> NSs electrode shows a lower R<sub>ct</sub>, and furthermore, aMoS<sub>x</sub>/Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> NSs (Co/Mo 8) own the lowest R<sub>ct</sub> indicating the better electron transport property. By analysing ECSA and EIS results, it can be concluded that aMoS<sub>x</sub>/Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> NSs possess more active sites with higher turnover frequency and faster electron transport capability for OER process.

#### 3.3. Oxygen Evolution Reaction Mechanism for aMoS<sub>x</sub>/Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> NSs

In alkaline media, the OER process is proposed and listed as follows (The M in the following processes refers to the active sites on the catalyst, which is considered as cobalt atoms in this study)<sup>24,26</sup>:

$$M + OH^- \rightarrow M - OH + e^- \tag{1}$$

$$M-OH + OH^- \rightarrow M-O + e^- + H_2O$$
 (2)

$$M-O + OH^- \to M-OOH + e^-$$
 (3)

$$M-OOH + OH^- \rightarrow M-O_2 + e^- + H_2O$$
 (4)

$$M-O_2 \to M+O_2 \tag{5}$$

#### 3.4. The Effect of Ultrasonication Process towards aMoS<sub>x</sub>/Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> NSs

In order to investigate the effect of ultrasonication process towards the morphology and catalytic performance on synthesized non-ultrasonicating aMoS<sub>x</sub>/Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> NSs (Co/Mo 8) were synthesized by the same procedure as the normal ones (i.e. ultrasonicating aMoS<sub>x</sub>/Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> NSs (Co/Mo 8)) except applying stirring instead of ultrasonication process to attain (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>MoS<sub>4</sub> on Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> NSs. The morphologies of resultant non-ultrasonicating aMoS<sub>x</sub>/Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> NSs (Co/Mo 8) are shown in **Fig. 6a and b**, which reveals that the hexagonal shapes and stacked layer structures of Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> are conserved while MoS<sub>x</sub> tends to form nanoparticles with hierarchical sheets structure. As for electrocatalytic performances for OER, non-ultrasonicating aMoS<sub>x</sub>/Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> NSs (Co/Mo 8) perform relatively higher onset potential and lower catalytic current compared with normal  $aMoS_x/Co(OH)_2$  NSs (Co/Mo 8), as shown in **Fig. 6c**. In addition, **Fig. 6d** demonstrates Tafel plots of non-ultrasonicating aMoS<sub>x</sub>/Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> NSs (Co/Mo 8) is 78.5 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>, larger than 65.4 mVdec<sup>-1</sup> of the normal aMoS<sub>x</sub>/Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> NSs (Co/Mo 8). It is believed that in our study, violent ultrasonication is in favor to break stacked structures into pieces and endows more contact areas with electrolyte, which is benefit to expose electrochemical active areas and active sites for OER. Moreover, ultrasonication also ensures the homogeneously formation of amorphous MoS<sub>x</sub> on the surface. All of these confirm the effects of ultrasonication towards the improved OER activity.

### 3.5. The Promoted Effect of Mo Complexes Incorporation towards Oxygen **Evolution Reaction**

To further understand the functions of Mo complexes incorporation for enhancing OER performance, more control experiments are performed. In this section, (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>6</sub>Mo<sub>7</sub>O<sub>24</sub> precursor is applied to synthesize aMoO<sub>x</sub>/Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> NSs (Co/Mo 8) with the different Mo complexes incorporated with Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> NSs. The corresponding

SEM images show the morphology of sheets nanostructure in Fig. 7a, and the EDS spectrum (Fig. 7b) and mappinng images (Fig. S9) confirm the presence and uniform distribution of Co, Mo, and O elements in aMoO<sub>x</sub>/Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> NSs (Co/Mo 8). As for catalytic activity, aMoO<sub>x</sub>/Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> NSs (Co/Mo 8) also show obviously improved catalytic current density compared with Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> NSs (Fig. 7c). Moreover, aMoO<sub>x</sub>/Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> NSs (Co/Mo 8) show the faster charge transfer resistance compared with Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> NSs as shown in Fig. 7d. These results validate the better catalytic activity of aMoO<sub>x</sub>/Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> NSs and further confirm the important role of Mo complexes incorporation for designing the excellent OER catalysts.

To sum up, both structure characterizations and electrochemical measurements reveal that aMoS<sub>x</sub>/Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> NSs could act as electrocatalysts with high OER catalytic performance and Mo content plays a significant role for the catalytic activity. When the Co/Mo molar ratio of 8, aMoS<sub>x</sub>/Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> NSs show the best water oxidation performance. Either a lower or higher Co/Mo mole ratio will decrease the catalytic performances of composites. The excellent catalytic properties of aMoS<sub>x</sub>/Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> NSs are believed to be related with the following factors: 1) Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> with octahedral MO<sub>6</sub> layers structure possesses extraordinary inherent catalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction serving as substrate. 2) Violent ultrasonication could break stacked sheets into smaller layers ensuring that more electrochemically active areas as well as reaction sites are exposed into electrolyte, and the relatively open two-dimensional layered structure ensures the rapid proton-coupled electron transfer and fast diffusion paths for reactants or/and products, which contributes to its superior electrochemical performance. 3) The amorphous MoS<sub>x</sub> on the surface with rich defect sites and the disordered SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> originating from part oxidation of S<sup>2-</sup> benefit the surface hydrophilicity and the availability of H<sub>2</sub>O during OER process. 4) The strong interaction between MoS<sub>x</sub> and Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> may lead to the electron transfer from MoS<sub>x</sub> to Co(OH)2, which benefits the breaking of Co-O bond and acceleration of OER process. Therefore, these advantages boost superior OER activity of aMoS<sub>x</sub>/Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> NSs.

#### 4. Conclusions

In this study, we have successfully synthesized aMoS<sub>x</sub>/Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> NSs by developing amorphous MoS<sub>x</sub> on Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> nanosheets via three-step procedures including two-step thermal process and one-step ultrasonication process. aMoS<sub>x</sub>/Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> NSs perform dramatically improved OER activity compared with Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> NSs due to the electron transfer from amorphous MoS<sub>x</sub> structure to Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> and the enhanced surface hydrophilicity. Under the Co/Mo molar ratio to be 8, aMoS<sub>x</sub>/Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> NSs show the best OER activity with a smallest overpotential of 0.35 V at the current density of 10 mV cm<sup>-2</sup>, largest anodic currents, and Tafel slope down to 65.4 mV dec<sup>-1</sup> in 0.1 M KOH. We believe that our research enriches the strategies on non-first-row transition metal incorporation to design high-efficient OER catalysts, and the catalysts inspired by our work will be excellent alternative substitute for noble metal catalysts.

**aMoS**<sub>x</sub>/Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> nanosheets are synthesized by developing amorphous MoS<sub>x</sub> on Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> nanosheets and perform excellent OER catalytic activity with only 350 mV at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. The incorporation of amorphous molybdenum sulfide could enhance the hydrophilicity favoring the availability of reactant and induce the electron transfer for enhancing the OER catalytic activity of Co(OH)<sub>2</sub>.

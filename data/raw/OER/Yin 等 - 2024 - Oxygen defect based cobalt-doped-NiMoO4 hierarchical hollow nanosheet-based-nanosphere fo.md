Hollow structures with a hierarchical architecture and multi-composition have attracted extensive interest because of their fascinating physicochemical properties as well as wide applications. To improve the efficiency of overall water splitting, highly active and stable electrocatalysts are highly desirable. A novel high-efficiency oxygen defect based hierarchical hollow nanosheet-based-nanosphere Co-NiMoO<sub>4</sub>-HNS electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution was arranged by doping Co on a Ni-MoEG yolk/shell nanosphere. Co-NiMoO<sub>4</sub>-HNS has a greater hydrophilicity and smaller band gap than that of NiMoO<sub>4</sub>-CS. Post OER characterization indicates that the main active phase of the Co<sub>2</sub>-NiMoO<sub>4</sub>-HNS catalysts toward the OER are amorphous Ni<sup>3+</sup>, Co<sup>3+</sup>, and H-O and the high-valent Mo (+6) can make nickel and cobalt better maintain  $Ni^{3+}$  and  $Co^{3+}$  sites. Remarkably, this hierarchical hollow  $Co_2-NiMoO_4-HNS$ catalyst exhibits a favorable catalytic performance toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with a receivable overpotential of 270 mV achieving a current density of 10 mA  $cm^{-2}$  and a Tafel slope of  $65 \text{ mV dec}^{-1}$ . In expansion, as an electrocatalyst,  $Co_2$ -NiMo $_4$ -HNS appeared to have a great long-term steadiness in the electrolyte. This work may give a broad hypothetical and specialized background for plans of cost-effective bifunctional electrocatalysts.

## 1 Introduction

With the severe energy crisis and environmental pollution, developing a green sustainable energy is vitally important.<sup>1-4</sup> Most green and sustainable energy sources, such as solar and wind energy, are produced intermittently, however, and therefore, their large-scale application needs energy conversion or energy storage techniques. Electrochemical water splitting for hydrogen production is an efficient approach for the storage of intermittent energy sources. OER is a key half reaction of water splitting, which requires a large overpotential due to the high energy barrier in multi-step pathways. Therefore, developing efficient electrocatalysts to lower the OER overpotential is very necessary. Over the past few years, noble metal-based catalysts such as RuO2 and IrO2 exhibited a high catalytic activity for OER. Nevertheless, their high cost and low abundance cannot

NiMoO<sub>4</sub> has emerged as an attractive catalyst candidate because NiMo has a platinum-like electronic surface state and exhibits a strong synergy between electron-rich Ni and electron-deficient Mo within the NiMo-based catalysts. 15-18 However, we found out that the overpotentials of NiMoO<sub>4</sub> catalysts are still higher than 300 mV. This may be mainly attributed to their bad electrical conductivity and small active area. To further enhance the OER electrocatalytic activities of NiMoO<sub>4</sub> catalysts, modification of both the physical and chemical properties of the materials have been investigated. In order to obtain more active sites, hollow nanostructures with hierarchical architectures have aroused considerable interest for catalyzing an OER, because the hollow structures possess great advantages due to their unique properties of controllable size, high porosity, abundant active sites, and large specific surface area, which can enhance the ionic conductivity and induce broad application prospects. Among these hollow

meet the large-scale requirements, which compel researchers to look for non-noble metal-based catalysts for OER.5 Therefore, it is highly desirable to exploit inexpensive and earth abundant OER electrocatalysts. Over the past decade, transition metal oxides and hydroxides have been developed to catalyze OER due to their moderate activity, structural stability, and facile fabrication.6-14

nanostructure electrocatalysts, hollow microspheres with porous features have attracted much interest, which greatly facilitate the exposure of active sites to the electrolyte, 19-21 thus accelerating the diffusion of electrolyte into the active species, and boosting the release of the thus-formed oxygen bubbles from the surface of the catalyst. Many hollow microsphere nanostructures have been investigated for OER, including N-doped hollow carbon spheres, 22 C-doped Co/Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, 23 Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/ NBGHSs, 24 Co-NHCs, 25 NiS<sub>2</sub>(1 - x)Se<sub>2x</sub>, 26 CoNiO<sub>2</sub>/SNC, 27 Co@NC@MoS $_2$ , <sup>28</sup>  $\beta$ -Mo $_2$ C/C. <sup>29</sup> Although these transition-metal microsphere electrocatalysts possess the significant advantages of a large population of active sites, the overall OER performances are still limited by the low intrinsic activity of every catalytic site. Tuning the electronic structure of the electrocatalysts through introducing hetero atoms into the catalyst host or designing multi-metal catalysts has been considered as an important and efficient method for increasing the activities of every catalytic site.30-46 Especially, NiCo-based electrocatalysts have suitable atomic and electronic structures of the surface and interface with more active sites and more atomic defects exposed, which show a high activity, stability, and corrosion resistance during the OER process. 43-64 Therefore, a reasonable design of Co doping can efficiently improve the NiMo-based-catalytic properties of every catalytic site for a Ni-based catalyst.

In this study, we developed a new type of Co2-NiMoO4-HNS nanosheet hollow layered electrocatalyst by the metal-ion exchange etching of NiMoO4-CS yolk/shell nanospheres. The nanosheet-based hollow spheres endow the Co2-NiMoO4-HNS with abundant catalytic sites and a rapid mass transfer. More noteworthy, the synergistic effect of Co and Ni greatly accelerates the kinetics of OER. Specifically, the XPS reveal that the introduced Co2+ increased the concentration of oxygen defect concentration, and the Ni 2p of Co2-NiMoO4-HNS has a blue shift compared with that of NiMoO<sub>4</sub>-CS yolk/shell nanospheres, therefore benefiting the performance of OER. As an outcome, the Co2-NiMoO4-HNS exhibits outstanding OER catalytic activity. The Co2-NiMoO4-HNS electrocatalyst needs an overpotential of only 270 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. Furthermore, the Co<sub>2</sub>-NiMoO<sub>4</sub>-HNS electrocatalyst showed excellent stability even at a high current density of 370 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> over 20 h. The superior activity and robust stability demonstrated that the Co2-NiMoO4-HNS electrocatalyst has promising potential for application in large-scale water splitting.

## 3 Results and discussion

NJC

As shown in Fig. 1, Mo-EG was synthesized by a solvothermal method, MoO<sub>2</sub>(acac)<sub>2</sub> as the molybdenum source, and glycerol, isopropanol (IPA) together with a certain amount of water as the mixed solvent. As shown in Fig. S1(a) (ESI†), MoEG exhibited sphere-like morphologies, with an average size of about 600 nm, the surface is very smooth, and it is a solid sphere according to TEM (Fig. S1(b) and (c), ESI†), and was employed as the starting templating material. In the subsequent sulfidation step, through a weak alkaline-etching process in an ethanol/water medium, a hierarchical core-shell Mo-EG (a)Ni(OH)2 CS was first fabricated using Mo-EG nanospheres and nickel acetate as the starting materials. XRD (Fig. S2, ESI†) shows that the Mo-EG @Ni(OH)2 CS consist of Ni(OH)2. 0.75H<sub>2</sub>O and MoO<sub>2</sub>. Thus, during this step, nickel hydroxide nanosheets are coated on the MoEG templates by etching with a weak alkali. Uniform Co incorporation is achieved by stirring the core-shell Mo-EG @Ni(OH)2 CS in a cobalt nitrate aqueous solution at room temperature (with the samples at this stage denoted as Co-doped-Mo-EG @Ni(OH)2 HNS). From XRD (Fig. S2, ESI†), the XRD for Co-doped-Mo-EG @Ni(OH)2 HNS has slight differences with that of Mo-EG @Ni(OH)2 CS, the peak relative strength of MoO2 decreased, indicating that cobalt ion doping played a role in etching the Mo-EG core. Finally, the hierarchical hollow Co-doped-Mo-EG @Ni(OH)2 HNS were further converted into hierarchical Co-NiMoO4-HNS by an annealing process at 500 °C for 2 h under an air atmosphere.

Fig. 2 shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of Co-NiMoO<sub>4</sub>-HNS and NiMoO<sub>4</sub>-CS. The diffraction peaks in the XRD patterns of Co-NiMoO<sub>4</sub>-HNS and NiMoO<sub>4</sub>-CS can be assigned to NiMoO<sub>4</sub> (JCPDS, card no. 45-0142, cell parameters: a =1.0184 nm, b = 0.8734 nm, c = 0.7649 nm). Co-NiMoO<sub>4</sub>-HNS has similar reflection peaks to those of NiMoO4-CS but with slight differences in the peak positions and sizes due to the Co doping.<sup>26</sup> A series of typical diffraction peaks can be observed at 26.55, 26.57, 32.14, 33.73 and 38.95 and for each sample, this points to the (002), (220), (112), (22-2), (511) and (040) crystal planes of Monoclinic NiMoO<sub>4</sub>.

The morphologies of NiMoO<sub>4</sub>-CS and Co-NiMoO<sub>4</sub>-HNS were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The SEM images showed that the shapes of NiMoO4-CS and Co-NiMoO4-HNS were uniform (Fig. S3(a)-(f), ESI†). The external diameter of Co-NiMoO<sub>4</sub>-HNS is about one micrometer and has a hollow structure, due to the Co<sup>2+</sup> etching, and the appearance of the ball has been damaged to some extent (Fig. S3(b)-(f), ESI†). The morphology and microstructure of the NiMoO4-CS and Co-NiMoO<sub>4</sub>-HNS catalysts were further characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Fig. S4a (ESI†) shows a low-magnification TEM image of the NiMoO<sub>4</sub>-CS catalyst. It can be found that the NiMoO<sub>4</sub>-CS catalysts are yolk/shell nanospheres with obvious hierarchical structure. The diameters of the outside walls and hollow interiors for the NiMoO4-CS hierarchical nanosphere are around 70-90 and 670-740 nm, and the whole sphere is about 740-870 nm. The height of the nanosheet on the outer wall is about 80-100 nm. The highresolution HRTEM image (Fig. S4(b), ESI†) displays well-resolved lattice fringes with interplanar distances of 0.335 nm, consistent with the (220) plane of NiMoO<sub>4</sub>. The HRTEM images are consistent with the corresponding XRD data.

The TEM image of Co<sub>2</sub>-NiMo<sub>4</sub>-HNS is shown in Fig. 3(a), where it can be clearly seen that Co2-NiMo4-HNS has a hollow structure, and the external diameter of the whole nanosphere is about 830 nm. As shown in Fig. 3(b), the thickness and height of the nanosheets around the sphere are about 10-20 and 100 nm, respectively, and the ultra-thin and porous nanosheets allow the catalyst to be filled with active sites, thus ensuring its outstanding catalytic performance. Fig. 3(c) shows the highresolution TEM (HRTEM) images recorded from the corresponding regions marked by the black and white frames. The well-resolved lattice fringes in the regions with lattice spacings (d) of 0.335 and 0.327 nm can be assigned to the (220) and (112) planes of NiMoO<sub>4</sub>. The TEM results as well as the XRD patterns confirm that the Co-NiMoO4 mainly consists of Co-doped NiMoO<sub>4</sub> crystallites. To determine the existence of the Co in the structure of Co-NiMoO<sub>4</sub>, TEM and the corresponding energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) elemental mapping for a single nanocage were carried out (Fig. 3(d) and

Fig. S5, ESI†). It could be observed that the Ni, Co, Mo, and O elements are uniformly distributed, matching the profile well and reflecting its hollow characteristics. The percentage contents of O, Co Ni and Mo are 60.1%, 3.4%, 14.4% and 22.1%, respectively. The hollow properties and hierarchical structure of Co2-NiMo4-HNS nanospheres are of great significance to improve their catalytic activity.

The surface chemical compositions and valence states of Co2-NiMoO4-HNS and NiMoO4-CS were examined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements (Fig. 4). The survey XPS spectrum of Co<sub>2</sub>-NiMoO<sub>4</sub>-HNS (Fig. 4(a)) confirms that the Co<sub>2</sub>-NiMoO<sub>4</sub>-HNS consists of the Co, Ni, O, Mo and C elements. Typically, we compare the XPS results of Co<sub>2</sub>-NiMoO<sub>4</sub>-HNS and NiMoO4-CS catalysts. Fig. 4(b) shows the high-resolution XPS spectra of the Ni 2p for the Co<sub>2</sub>-NiMoO<sub>4</sub>-HNS and NiMoO<sub>4</sub>-CS catalysts. In the Ni 2p region of the NiMoO<sub>4</sub>-CS catalysts, peak fitting of the high-resolution Ni 2p spectrum of Co<sub>2</sub>-NiMoO<sub>4</sub>-HNS indicates that the peaks in the 2p<sub>3/2</sub> (855.2 eV) and 2p<sub>1/2</sub> (872.9 eV) regions with two shakeup satellites at 862.0 and 879.8 eV are related to the presence of Ni<sup>2+</sup> species; the NiMoO<sub>4</sub>-CS catalyst possesses similar Ni species, but their peak positions are slightly shifted to lower binding energies by 0.1 eV. Fig. 4(c) shows the XPS spectra of Co 2p for the Co<sub>2</sub>-NiMoO<sub>4</sub>-HNS catalyst. Co 2p<sub>3/2</sub> can be fitted to  $Co^{2+}$  (780.5 eV) and a satellite (786.4 eV). Co  $2p_{1/2}$  can be fitted with Co<sup>2+</sup> (796.6 eV), Co<sup>2+</sup> and a satellite (802.7 eV).<sup>27</sup> It can be seen from Fig. 4(d) that the Mo3d of Co2-NiMoO4-HNS was fitted as two peaks, which were respectively attributed to Mo<sup>5+</sup> and Mo<sup>6+</sup>. The original two peaks were located at 231.7 eV and 234.8 eV, belonging to Mo 3d<sub>5/2</sub> and Mo 3d<sub>3/2</sub>. Compared with NiMoO<sub>4</sub>-CS, the Mo3d of Co<sub>2</sub>-NiMoO<sub>4</sub>-HNS had a red shift of 0.6 eV.<sup>28</sup> The higher content of Mo<sup>5+</sup> is evidence for the existence of more oxygen defects. As can be seen from Fig. 4(e), O1s for Co<sub>2</sub>-NiMoO<sub>4</sub>-HNS was fitted as three peaks, the three characteristic peaks are at 529.1 eV, 530.2 eV and 531.1 eV for the oxygen element, corresponding to an M-O bond, oxygen defect and water adsorbed on the surface of the

catalyst, respectively. Compared with NiMoO<sub>4</sub>-CS, the red shifts were 0.18 and 1.48 eV. The red shifts of Mo and Ni after cobalt

doping indicated a partial electron transfer from Co to Ni and Mo upon Co doping. For the C 1s region (Fig. 4(f)), the main peak can be split into four peaks at 284.6 and 288.1 eV, corresponding to sp<sup>2</sup> C=C, C=O.

Fig. S6 (ESI†) shows the Raman spectra of the NiMoO<sub>4</sub>, NiMoO<sub>4</sub>-CS and Co<sub>2</sub>-NiMoO<sub>4</sub>-HNS catalysts. The Raman spectrum of NiMoO<sub>4</sub>-CS shows an intense peak at 954.8 cm<sup>-1</sup> with some other peaks at 905.4 cm<sup>-1</sup> and 824.9 cm<sup>-1</sup>, which can all be attributed to the Mo-O bond; the peaks at 705.7 cm<sup>-1</sup>, 364 cm<sup>-1</sup>, and 254 cm<sup>-1</sup> are due to the asymmetric stretching mode of Ni-O-Mo bonds, the bending mode of Mo-O, and the deformation mode of Mo-O-Mo, respectively, while all the above bands shift downward with the increase of Co concentration in the samples. The most intense peak was located at 939 cm<sup>-1</sup>, and other less intense peaks were located at 889 cm<sup>-1</sup>, 818 cm<sup>-1</sup>, 655.9 cm<sup>-1</sup>, 360 cm<sup>-1</sup> and 284 cm<sup>-1</sup>. The results indicate that the cobalt doping was successful.

The OER performances of these Co-NiMoO<sub>4</sub>-HNS catalysts were first measured in a 1.0 M KOH solution using a threeelectrode system at a scan rate of 2 mV s<sup>-1</sup>, where carbon-papersupported catalysts, graphite rod, and Hg/HgO (KOH saturated)

were used as the working electrode, counter electrode, and reference electrode, respectively. The electrocatalytic activities of the catalysts were evaluated by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) between 1.0 and 2.0 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). Fig. 5(a) shows the polarization curves of these catalysts. The overpotential that achieves a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> is a critical factor for OER catalysts. To drive a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. Co<sub>1</sub>-NiMoO<sub>4</sub>-HNS, Co<sub>1.5</sub>-NiMoO<sub>4</sub>-HNS, Co<sub>2</sub>-NiMoO<sub>4</sub>-HNS, Co<sub>4</sub>-NiMoO<sub>4</sub>-HNS, Co<sub>6</sub>-NiMoO<sub>4</sub>-HNS and NiMoO<sub>4</sub>-CS (Fig. S7(a), ESI†) require an overpotential  $(\eta_{\rm OER})$  of 311, 296, 270, 339 and 332 mV, respectively. Co<sub>2</sub>-NiMoO<sub>4</sub>-HNS exhibited the best OER catalytic activities, and the OER activity outperforms that of the commercial IrO2 catalyst (Fig. S8, ESI†), and the overpotential at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> for Co<sub>2</sub>-NiMoO<sub>4</sub>-HNS is 10 mV lower than that for the IrO2 catalyst. These results support that the Co<sub>2</sub>-NiMoO<sub>4</sub>-HNS catalyst is a very promising metal oxide electrocatalyst for the OER.

The Tafel slope data obtained in terms of the Tafel equation  $(Z = a + b \log |i|)^{52}$  where Z represents the overpotential, a is a constant, and b is the Tafel slope) were used to analyze the OER kinetics of these catalysts. As shown in Fig. 5(b), the Tafel slope for Co<sub>2</sub>-NiMoO<sub>4</sub>-HNS is 65 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>, which is smaller than those of Co<sub>1</sub>-NiMoO<sub>4</sub>-HNS (68 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>), Co<sub>1.5</sub>-NiMoO<sub>4</sub>-HNS

The Tafel slope is the slope of the linear part of the Tafel curve and revealed as:<sup>53</sup>

Tafel slope =

R is the gas constant; T is the absolute temperature in K;  $\alpha$  is the charge transfer coefficient; n is the number of electrons transferred; F is the Faraday constant. For the water oxidation reaction, the rate determining step can be determined through the number of electrons being transferred, which was also calculated according to the Tafel formula. For a one electron transfer reaction, the Tafel slope should be 120 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>; the Tafel slope for NiMoO<sub>4</sub>-CS is 153 mV  $dec^{-1}$  (Fig. S7(b), ESI†), so the rate determining step for NiMoO<sub>4</sub>-CS is the first electron transfer step. On the basis of the Tafel slope of the Co2- $NiMoO_4$ -HNS sample, 65 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>, the *n* value is calculated to be approximately 2, and thus the two electron process is predominant and the corresponding rate determining step is<sup>54</sup>

According to the Tafel analysis, the rate determining step has changed through the mixing of Co and NiMoO<sub>4</sub>-CS, which reduces the resistance of the OER process.<sup>23</sup> The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data of these nanotubes at  $Z_{\rm OER}$  = 300 mV were measured to further study the OER kinetics of the nanotubes. The inset of Fig. 5(c) shows the fitted equivalent circuit, in which  $R_1$  and  $R_2$  represent the solution resistance and charge-transfer resistance, respectively.<sup>64</sup> Obviously, each plot shows a semicircle in a high-frequency region and a straight line in the low-frequency region, suggesting light electrochemical polarization and good capacitive properties.30 Co2-NiMoO4-HNS possesses the smallest R2 value of 1.357  $\Omega$  compared to those of the Co<sub>1</sub>-NiMoO<sub>4</sub>-HNS (1.462  $\Omega$ ), Co<sub>1.5</sub>-NiMoO<sub>4</sub>-HNS (1.677  $\Omega$ ), Co<sub>4</sub>-NiMoO<sub>4</sub>-HNS  $(1.363 \Omega)$  and  $Co_6$ -NiMoO<sub>4</sub>-HNS  $(1.714 \Omega)$ , indicating the fastest charge-transfer process within Co2-NiMoO4-HNS. As a comparison, the  $R_2$  value of NiMoO<sub>4</sub>-CS is 1.8  $\Omega$  cm<sup>2</sup> (Fig. S7(c), ESI†), which is bigger than Co-NiMoO<sub>4</sub>-HNS. Therefore, the introduction of Co reduces the charge-transfer resistance of the NiMobased catalysts, thus facilitating an improvement in the OER kinetics. The superior OER performances of Co<sub>2</sub>-NiMoO<sub>4</sub>-HNS are comparable to those of the state-of-the-art electrocatalystcontaining Co species reported recently (Fig. 5(d)).

To analyze the reasons for the enhanced OER activity of the Co-NiMoO<sub>4</sub>-HNS compared to that of NiMoO<sub>4</sub>-CS, their electrochemical active surface areas, which are directly proportional to their electrochemical double-layer capacitances ( $C_{\rm dl}$ ), were estimated. To obtain the electrochemical active surface area (ECSA), cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements in the nonfaradaic region under different scan rates were carried out (Fig. S9, ESI†). As expected, Co<sub>2</sub>-NiMoO<sub>4</sub>-HNS exhibits the highest double-layer capacitance ( $C_{\rm dl}$ ) of 9.965 mF cm<sup>-2</sup> (Fig. 5(e)), fairly superior to those of Co<sub>1</sub>-NiMoO<sub>4</sub>-HNS (6.697 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>),  $Co_{1.5}$ -NiMoO<sub>4</sub>-HNS (7.403 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>),  $Co_4$ -NiMoO<sub>4</sub>-HNS

 $(8.716 \text{ mF cm}^{-2})$ , and  $Co_6$ -NiMoO<sub>4</sub>-HNS  $(6.345 \text{ mF cm}^{-2})$ . Generally, a flat surface area of 1 cm2 CC has an average specific capacitance value of 40 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>. Therefore, the ECSA value can be converted by  $C_{\rm dl}$  through the following equation:55

ECSA = 
$$C_{\rm dl}$$
 (mF cm<sup>-2</sup>)/0.04 (mF cm<sup>-2</sup>) (3)

The ECSA values of Co<sub>1</sub>-NiMoO<sub>4</sub>-HNS, Co<sub>1.5</sub>-NiMoO<sub>4</sub>-HNS, Co2-NiMoO4-HNS, Co4-NiMoO4-HNS, Co6-NiMoO4-HNS are 167, 185, 249, 217, 158, respectively. The results reflect that Co2-NiMoO4-HNS has the largest ECSA among the contrasting electrocatalysts, again attesting to the much more excellent OER performance.

To gain an insight into the intrinsic OER activity, the TOF values for the OER electrocatalysts were calculated. The number of active sites (n) was first examined employing cyclic voltammograms with a phosphate buffer (pH = 7) at a scan rate of 50 mV s<sup>-1</sup>. Then, the voltammetric charges (Q) can be determined after deduction of the blank value. n (mol) could be determined with the following equation:56

$$n(\text{mol}) = Q/4F(\text{OER}) \tag{4}$$

where F is the Faraday constant. TOF (s<sup>-1</sup>) could be calculated with the following equation:

$$TOF(s^{-1}) = I \times A/4nF(OER)$$
 (5)

where I(A) is the current of the polarization curve obtained from the Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) measurements, A represents the surface area of the anode.31 The TOFs of Co2-NiMoO4-HNS are much higher than those of NiMoO4-CS at the same overpotentials. As shown in Fig. S10 (ESI†), the TOF value for  $Co_2$ -NiMoO<sub>4</sub>-HNS at 1.6 V is 5.45 s<sup>-1</sup>, which is 9 times higher than those for NiMoO<sub>4</sub>-CS. Overall, the Co incorporation not only enhances the OER activity of the catalysts but also changes the OER mechanism. In addition, the oxidation peaks before the OER for Co2-NiMoO4-HNS shift slightly toward a low potential, and this shift suggests a strong electron interaction between the Ni and Co, which may make Ni oxidation easier but Co oxidation more difficult, and the shift can boost the OER activities because the electronic structure of Ni can be tuned by Co-doping.<sup>63</sup> As shown in Fig. S7(a) (ESI†), the area of the oxidation peaks for Co2-NiMoO4-HNS are bigger than those of NiMoO<sub>4</sub>-CS, which indicated that the extent of the Ni(II)/ Ni(III) or Co(II)/Co(III) oxidation is remarkably increased after mixing Co with Ni. These results of overpotential, Tafel slope, R<sub>ct</sub>, C<sub>dl</sub>, and TOF indicated that the Co<sub>2</sub>-NiMoO<sub>4</sub>-HNS catalyst exhibits a significantly enhanced OER activity compared to those of the NiMoO<sub>4</sub>-CS catalysts.

In order to analyze the physical mechanism of hybrid atom doping, UV-visible absorption spectra were obtained, and Kubelka-Munk plots for the band gap energies were estimated. As shown in Fig. S11 (ESI†), the band gap energies of NiMoO<sub>4</sub>-CS and NiMoO<sub>4</sub>-HNS are 1.4 and 0.8 eV, respectively. This result indicates that the introduction of cobalt atoms can efficiently narrow the band gap of NiMoO<sub>4</sub>-CS.

Besides activity, stability is also an important factor for the water electrolysis of these catalysts.<sup>61</sup> The long-term stability of the Co2-NiMoO4-HNS catalyst was assessed at a given overpotential of 445 mV. As shown in Fig. 5(f), the current density was not decreased after 20 hours of measurements, which indicated that the Co<sub>2</sub>-NiMoO<sub>4</sub>-HNS catalysts have a robust stability toward the OER. Besides, Co2-NiMoO4-HNS also demonstrates a greater hydrophilicity (Fig. S12(a)-(e), ESI†) and larger gas contact angle, which is favorable for rapid gas release and liquid diffusion because of the unbalanced Laplace pressure, thus achieving quick OER kinetics.<sup>32</sup> After the OER stability test, the structure of the Co<sub>2</sub>-NiMoO<sub>4</sub>-HNS was characterized by XRD, SEM, TEM, and XPS. Comparison of the XRD patterns of Co<sub>2</sub>-NiMoO<sub>4</sub>-HNS before and after the OER process indicates that most of the diffraction peaks from the monoclinic NiMoO<sub>4</sub> are retained, and the peak positions of the (112) and (040) planes of NiMoO<sub>4</sub> shift toward higher diffraction degrees, indicating that the crystal structures have changed (Fig. S13, ESI†). SEM images indicate that the hierarchical and porous features of the Co2-NiMoO4-HNS remained almost unchanged (Fig. S14(a) and (b), ESI†). To better understand the change in the microstructure of Co2-NiMoO4-HNS after 10 h of long-term electrolysis for the HER in an alkaline medium, a more detailed characterization was carried out using transmission electron microscopy (TEM).<sup>62</sup> As shown in Fig. 6(a) and (b), the nanosheet changed to become disordered. From Fig. 6(c), it can be found that the nanosheets were filled with nanopores. For high-magnification TEM images (Fig. 6(d)), the (330) and (220) plane of NiMoO<sub>4</sub> can be found, and the main exposed crystal faces have changed. 60 The surface valence states of the Co<sub>2</sub>-NiMoO<sub>4</sub>-HNS catalyst before and after the OER process are obviously different (Fig. S15, ESI†). Fig. S15(a) (ESI†) shows the high-resolution XPS spectra of O 1s for the Co2-NiMoO4-HNS catalyst after OER. Obviously,<sup>57</sup> the ratio of H-O is higher than

Fig. 6 Co-NiMoO<sub>4</sub>-HNS after long-term electrolysis for the OER in 1 M KOH. (a) and (b) Low-magnification TEM images, and (c) and (d) highmagnification TEM images

before, from 15.47% to 75.61% (Fig. S16, ESI†). In Fig. S15b (ESI†), the Ni 2p region for the Co<sub>2</sub>-NiMoO<sub>4</sub>-HNS catalysts, the binding energies at 854.6, 856.7, and 860.9 eV can be assigned to the presence of the related Ni<sup>2+</sup> and Ni<sup>3+</sup>. Fig. S15(c) (ESI†) shows the XPS of the Co  $2p_{3/2}$  after the OER catalysis. <sup>58,59</sup> The Co  $2p_{3/2}$  can be fitted to Co3+ (779.5 eV) and Co2+ (780.5 eV). It can be seen from Fig. S15(d) (ESI†) after the OER, Mo fitted as four peaks, which were respectively attributed to Mo<sup>5+</sup> and Mo<sup>6+</sup>, and the increase in the proportion of Mo<sup>5+</sup> indicates that molybdenum contributes to the maintenance of Co3+ and Ni3+. The original four peaks were located at 231.7 eV, 231.2 eV 234.5 eV, and 235.2 eV belonging to Mo  $3d_{5/2}$  and Mo  $3d_{3/2}$ . These XPS results indicate that the surfaces of the Co2-NiMoO4-HNS catalysts after the OER are mainly composed of Ni<sup>2+</sup>, Ni<sup>3+</sup>, Co<sup>2+</sup>, Co<sup>3+</sup>, Mo<sup>5+</sup>, Mo<sup>6+</sup>, and H-O species.<sup>59</sup> Thus, the main active phase of the Co<sub>2</sub>-NiMoO<sub>4</sub>-HNS catalysts toward the OER are amorphous Ni<sup>3+</sup>, Co<sup>3+</sup>, and H-O. In summary, XPS research shows that Cobalt doping increases the bonding energy of Ni making it easier to be oxidized to Ni<sup>3+</sup>, and the Mo makes Ni and Co easier to maintain Ni<sup>3+</sup> and Co<sup>3+</sup> as active sites.

## 4 Conclusions

To sum up, Co-NiMoO<sub>4</sub>-HNS was successfully cultivated on an NiMoO<sub>4</sub>-CS template by a Co<sup>2+</sup> exchange method, and hierarchically hollow nanosheet-based-nanospheres were obtained. These not only retain the original morphology of NiMoO<sub>4</sub>-CS, but also carry out hollow etching and greatly improve the electrocatalytic performance. The Co-NiMoO<sub>4</sub>-HNS catalysts exhibit a significantly enhanced OER activity compared to the pure NiMoO<sub>4</sub>-CS catalyst, and the highest OER activity is achieved by Co atom doping, outperforming most reported OER catalysts. The synergistic effect between Co, Ni and Mo makes the catalyst have a better performance and stability. To drive a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, the Co<sub>2</sub>-NiMoO<sub>4</sub>-HNS catalyst required an overpotential of 270 mV for OER and a Tafel slope of 65 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>, and a prominent long-term durability. The outstanding activity and excellent long-term stability indicate that the Co2-NiMoO4-HNS catalyst has promising potential for applications in large-scale water splitting.

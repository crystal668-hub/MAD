## **Abstract**

Development of low cost, efficient, noble metal free electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is important for renewable energy conversion. Herein, we prepared hierarchical hollow NiCoMn-LDH microcuboids consisted of two dimensional (2D) nanosheets by a solvothermal method. The prepared Ni6Co11Mn-LDH exhibits high OER activity, which show an overpotential of 248 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm-2 and a small Tafel slope of 72.2 mV dec-1 , even better than the noble metal RuO<sup>2</sup> catalyst. It remains stable after chronopotentiometric test at a high current density of 100 mA cm-2 for 22 hours, indicating a potential practical application. The enhanced OER performance is ascribed to the transition of Ni2+ to Ni3+ in NiCo-LDH induced by doping Mn, which activates the Ni sites. This work provides an approach to further optimizing the OER performance of NiCo-LDH based catalysts.

## **Introduction**

To address the challenge of energy and environmental crises, the development of innovative energy conversion and storage techniques have been extensively researched, such as water-splitting [1-3] , CO<sup>2</sup> reduction [4-6] , and rechargeable metal–air batteries [7, 8] . The electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER), as a key half reaction of the above reactions, which is known a kinetically sluggish process and usually proceeds with a large overpotential to overcome kinetic barrier caused by four proton-coupled electron transfer process [9-11] . At present, researchers have made great effort to the exploration of various well-designed advanced materials as catalysts for OER. For replacing noble metal OER electrocatalysts, earth-abundant NiCo-based materials are considered to be one of the best OER electrocatalysts [12-15] .

NiCo-layered double hydroxides (LDH) with highly tunable structure, compositional flexibility, and tunable interlayer anions is a kind of important OER catalysts. In various of NiCo-LDH materials, Ni2+ and Co3+ are the main existing forms. It is believed that Co3+ is an active site of OER [16, 17] . Compared with Ni3+ , Ni2+ shows poor activity [18-22] . So if we could convert the Ni2+ LDH into Ni3+, it will greatly improve the OER activity of the material [19, 22-24] .

Since Mn has similar ionic radius to those of Co cation, it is easy substitution of Co by Mn. Besides, due to the ionic radius of Mn3+ cation (0.0645 nm) slightly larger than that of the Co3+ cation (0.0545 nm), the lattice volumes are expected to be expanded, leading to more lattice distortions [25, 26] . Thus, more defects are introduced and more active sites are created, which led to an enhanced OER activity. Furthermore, Mn doping can induce the transition of Ni2+ to Ni3+ and activate the Ni sites, which will further enhance the OER intrinsic activity of the catalyst [17, 27] . In addition, the increased M3+(Mn3+ and Ni3+) content is considered beneficial to charge transfer [27] .

In this work, we studied the effect of Mn doping on the OER performance of NiCo-layered double hydroxide (LDH). We prepared a series of hierarchical hollow NiCoMn-LDH microcuboids consisted of two dimensional nanosheets by a one-pot solvothermal method. These novel hierarchical hollow NiCoMn-LDH microcuboids with unique micro-/nanostructures show excellent catalytic activity and stability towards OER. By adjusting the doping amount of Mn, high OER activity can be realized, even better than the noble metal RuO<sup>2</sup> catalyst. The prepared Ni6Co11Mn-LDH catalyst shows an exceptional OER performance with an overpotential of 248 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm-2 and a small Tafel slope of 72.2 mV dec-1 . This work not only provides an excellent OER electrocatalyst, but also provides an approach to further optimizing the OER performance of NiCo-LDH based catalysts.

## **Results and discussion**

#### **Morphology and structural characterization**

XRD patterns of the undoped and Mn-doped NiCo-LDH materials are shown in Figure 1a. All the diffraction peaks of the as-sythesized products can be indexed to a hexagonal phase Ni(OH)2·H2O (JCPDS card no. 38–0715) with a hydrotalcite-like structure. The diffraction peaks of Mn doped samples show slightly shifted to the lower 2θ direction, which could be ascribed to the Mn ions with a bigger ionic radius. The crystallinity of the samples decreases with the appropriate ratio of Mn doping. It is worth noting that the (003) planes of Ni6Co11Mn-LDH and Ni3Co5Mn-LDH disappear. This results in an increase in the proportion of highly active (110) lattice planes, which may lead to an enhanced activity of these samples [28-30] .

TG and DSC were measured in Ar atmosphere to examine the conversion process of the prepared Ni6Co11Mn-LDH during calcination (Figure S1). The weight loss of the Ni6Co11Mn-LDH sample in TG curve decreases slowly before 205<sup>o</sup>C, accompanied by about 11% weight loss. It corresponds to the removal of adsorbed water in Ni6Co11Mn-LDH sample as well as crystalline water in the interlayer. An obvious weight loss was observed in the temperature range from 205 to 275<sup>o</sup>C, corresponding to about 47% weight loss. It is ascribed to the thermal decomposition reaction of the Ni6Co11Mn-LDH sample. The carbonate ions in the intermediate layer are released in the form of carbon dioxide. Finally, the oxides of nickel, cobalt and manganese are remained. The endothermic peak of DSC curve is well consistent with the TG curve.

Figures 1b-c presents field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of Ni6Co11Mn-LDH and NiCo2-LDH, respectively. It can be seen that the products show hollow microcuboid morphology consisting of nanosheets. Ni6Co11Mn-LDH has a length of 7 μm and a width of 0.79 μm, while the latter has a length of 12 μm and a width of 1.3 μm. The formation of hollow layered microcuboids is a self-supporting chemical reaction. The metal acetate hydroxide microtubes are formed first in the reaction system. Afterwards, the acetate hydroxide gradually dissolves to form flake-shaped LDH, and finally hollow layered microcuboids are obtained [31] . It is noted that the hollow microcuboids structure may not form if the doping ratio of Mn is too large, as shown in Figure S2. As shown in Figures S3b-d, the elemental mapping images of Ni6Co11Mn-LDH exhibit the elements of Ni, Co, and Mn are evenly distributed on the surface of the material. In addition, the ratio of Ni, Co and Mn is close to the reactant ratio confirmed by the energy dispersive X-ray analysis (Figure S3a and Table S1). Besides, different solvothermal temperatures will affect the morphology. As shown in Figures S4a-c, the Ni6Co11Mn-LDH synthesized at 140<sup>o</sup>C shows a layered microcuboid structure, but no obvious hollow structure is observed. A hollow layered microcuboid structure can be observed in samples synthesized at 160<sup>o</sup>C, but the length is shorter. When the synthesis temperature is increased to 200<sup>o</sup>C, it shows a spherical structure with uneven size. It can be concluded that only at 180<sup>o</sup>C can the sample exhibit a uniform hollow layered microcuboid structure. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) image in Figures 1d-e clearly demonstrates the hollow interior structure of Ni6Co11Mn-LDH microcuboid. It can be seen that the ultrathin nanosheets are grown vertically on the surface of tetragonal microtubes. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (Inset in Figure 1e) of the as-prepared Ni6Co11Mn-LDH shows the (101), (012) and (110) lattice planes, which is consistent well with the XRD patterns.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to examine the composition of the samples and the valence state of the metal ions. A typical X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) survey spectrum of Ni6Co11Mn-LDH indicates the existence of Ni, Co, Mn and O elements, as shown in Figure S5. The Ni 2p3/2, Ni 2p1/2, Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2 spectra are shown in Figures 2a-b. As shown in Figure 2a, in the Ni 2p XPS spectrum, two peaks at 855.19 eV and 872.57 eV can be assigned to Ni 2p3/2 and Ni 2p1/2 due to spin-orbit interactions. In addition, there are two shakeup satellite peaks located at 861.26 eV and 878.93 eV. The pair of peaks at binding energies of 856.2eV and 873.5 eV was corresponded to Ni3+, and the other pair located at 855.19 eV and 872.3 eV was assigned to Ni2+. Interestingly, the peak area ratio of Ni3+ to Ni2+ is 0.77 in NiCo2-LDH, and it is 1.32 in Ni6Co11Mn-LDH. The result suggests that Ni6Co11Mn‐LDH exhibits a prominent increase of Ni3+ with respect to the pristine NiCo2‐LDH, which confirms that electron transfer from the anti-bonding e<sup>g</sup> \* orbital of Ni2+ to the bonding t2g orbital of Mn4+ occurs in Ni6Co11Mn-LDH [17, 27] . A higher transition metal Ni oxidation state is favorable for improving the OER performance [32,33] . For the Co 2p spectra (Figure 2b), two main peaks at 780.66 eV and 796.34 eV are corresponded to Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2, respectively. At the same time, two satellite peaks (785.60 eV and 802.50 eV) were observed. The deconvoluted peaks located at 780.4 eV and 796.20 eV are assigned to Co3+, and the other pair located at the binding energies of 781.90 and 797.97 eV was attributed to Co2+, which demonstrates the presence of Co2+ and Co3+ . It can be seen that the peak area ratio of Co3+ to Co2+ in both samples is close to 1.4. In addition, compared the valence states of Co between Ni6Co11Mn-LDH and NiCo2-LDH, we can find that there is no obvious difference, which means that the effect of manganese doping on the valence of Co in the materials can be ignored.

**Figure 2** High-resolution XPS spectra of (a) Ni 2p of Ni6Co11Mn-LDH and NiCo2-LDH; (b) Co 2p of Ni6Co11Mn-LDH and NiCo2-LDH; (c) Mn2p of Ni6Co11Mn-LDH; (d) O1s of Ni6Co11Mn-LDH and NiCo2-LDH.

The Mn 2p and O 1s spectra are shown in Figure 2c and 2d, respectively. As shown in Figure 2c, it can be seen that Mn3+ (642 eV) is dominant in the Ni6Co11Mn-LDH as a result of the electron transfer between Ni2+ and Mn4+. In addition, the weak peak located at 653.4 eV could be assigned to Mn4+, which confirms the initial state of the doped manganese is Mn4+ , while it was transformed to Mn3+ during the crystal growth progress. Furthermore, in the O 1s region (Figure 2d), the spectra were deconvoluted into two peaks in which the peak at 531.0 eV is assigned to the OH<sup>−</sup> species in the materials, and the other peak at 532.6 eV can be ascribed to the absorption of O2. Compared the valence states of O between Ni6Co11Mn-LDH and NiCo2-LDH, it is concluded that there is no obvious influence on O with the introduction of Mn.

#### **Electrocatalytic activity characterizations**

In this work, we have subsequently investigated the OER catalytic activity of

NixCo2x-yMny-LDH in 1 M KOH. To reveal the effect of the different doping amount of manganese on the OER activity, NiCo2-LDH, NiCoMn-LDH, Ni3Co5Mn-LDH, Ni6Co11Mn-LDH were tested and compared with that of commercial RuO<sup>2</sup> (Figure 3a). The overpotential of the Ni6Co11Mn-LDH is 248 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm-2 , which is much lower than those of other transition metal catalysts. As shown in Figure 3b, Ni6Co11Mn-LDH exhibits a small Tafel slope of 72.2 mV dec-1 , much lower than other NixCo2x-yMny-LDH materials. In addition, the Tafel slope of Ni6Co11Mn-LDH (72.2 mV dec-1 ) is much lower than that of RuO<sup>2</sup> (107.4 mV dec-1 ), revealing a faster kinetics process, which is advantageous for practical applications. For comparison, only Super P was also prepared as ink for OER test, as shown in Figure S6. It can be seen that the current density at 1.6 V is only 0.0076 mA cm-2 , which indicates that the function of Super P is only to enhance the conductivity of the catalysts. As shown in Figure S7 and Figure 3c, the double layer capacitance (*C*dl) was measured by the cyclic voltammetry curves in the non-faradaic region at various scan rates. The Ni6Co11Mn-LDH displays a much bigger *C*dl (6.72 mF cm -2 ) than the other three NixCo2x-yMny-LDH samples. Meanwhile, the active surface area measured by the formula is 32.9 cm 2 for Ni6Co11Mn-LDH (Table S2), indicating the high exposure of active sites and electrochemical surface area. As shown in Figure S8, the LSV based on geometric area was normalized to the electrochemical surface area (ECSA). It can be seen that the electrochemical activity based on the ECSA of NiCoMn-LDH, Ni3Co5Mn-LDH and Ni6Co11Mn-LDH are better than that of the NiCo2-LDH, which further demonstrates that Mn doping can enhance the catalytic activity of NiCo based LDH. As shown in Figure 3d and Table S3, the Ni6Co11Mn-LDH catalyst outperforms most of advanced transition metal OER catalysts [13, 34-43] .To further gain insight into the effect of Mn doping on the kinetics property, we use electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) to investigate the interfacial charge transfer during OER. As shown in Figure 3e, the Ni6Co11Mn-LDH sample shows a much smaller Nyquist semicircle diameter than other samples. As usual, the Randles circuit model was used to simulate the EIS data. *R*ct represents the charge transfer resistance. From Figure 3e, it is found that the *R*ct of Ni6Co11Mn-LDH samples is much lower than those of NiCo2-LDH (27.1 Ω), NiCoMn-LDH (31.5 Ω) and Ni3Co5Mn-LDH (22.6 Ω). It indicates that the appropriate amount doping of manganese can greatly facilitate electron transfer. Since a smaller charge transfer resistance corresponds to a faster reaction kinetics, this result also verifies much more advantageous OER kinetics of Ni6Co11Mn-LDH than other samples. The Faradaic efficiency (FE) of the OER process was determined by rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE) test as introduced in the experimental section. As shown in Figure 3f, FE of Ni6Co11Mn-LDH is close to 100% for OER. The Ni6Co11Mn-LDH shows excellent cycling stability in 1M KOH. From Figure 4a, it can be seen that Ni6Co11Mn-LDH exhibits a negligible current density loss after long-term cycles. The low overpotential was retained after numerous CV cycles. It can be seen that the overall structure of the tetragonal microtube is still kept after 2000 CV cycles (Figure S9). In addition, the binding energy of nickel and cobalt elements increases after 2000 CV cycles, as shown in Figure S10. This means that the process is accompanied by an increasing oxidation states of nickel and cobalt. Higher transition metal Ni and Co oxidation states are favorable for improving the OER performance [32,33] , which is beneficial for the good stability of the catalyst. And it also shows that CV activation is very necessary before the LSV test. Furthermore, to measure the long-term durability of the catalysts, chronopotentiometry was tested at a current density of 100 mA cm-2 , as shown in Figure 4b. In a control experiment, nickel foam (NF) was used as a working electrode instead of glassy carbon electrode. The NF with loading NiCo2-LDH catalyst and bare NF were also tested as a reference. During the 22 hours stability test, it can be seen that the stability of bare NF decreased sharply after 2 hours, accompanied by 41.86% loss of activity. And the NiCo2-LDH/NF only shows 5.33% activity loss. Compared with that of the bare NF, the improved performance of the NiCo2-LDH catalyst can be attributed to its layered hollow skeleton structure. It should be noted that the overpotential of Ni6Co11Mn-LDH/NF is reduced by 8 mV and accompanied by 1.89% activity enhancement during the durability test for 22 hours, indicating that the sample has an excellent stability. It shows that the Ni6Co11Mn-LDH has excellent practical application, which meets the requirements of high stability under the severe commercial operation conditions.

## **Conclusions**

In summary, hierarchical hollow NiCoMn-LDH microcuboids were successfully prepared by a solvothermal method. The hierarchical hollow NiCoMn-LDH microcuboids is consisted of 2D nanosheets. As an OER electrocatalyst, it shows an overpotential of 248 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm-2 and a small Tafel slope of 72.2 mV dec-1 . The improved performance is ascribed to the transition of Ni2+ to Ni3+ induced by Mn doping. It shows excellent stability for 22 hours at a current density of 100 mA cm-2 . This work provides an effective strategy to further optimizing the OER performance of NiCo-based LDH catalysts.

## **Experimental Section**

#### **Materials**

Ni(Ac)2·4H2O (99%), Co(Ac)2·4H2O (99.5%), Mn(Ac)2·4H2O (99%), 1,3-propanediol (98%) and isopropanol (99.5%) were purchased from Shanghai Macklin Biochemical Co. Ltd. Potassium hydroxide (85%) was supplied by Guangdong Guanghua Technology Co., Ltd. Nafion (5-5.4wt%) was supplied by Sigma-Aldrich.

#### **Preparation of NixCo2x-yMny-LDH**

For preparing Ni6Co11Mn-LDH, in a typical synthesis, 74.7 mg of Ni(Ac)2·4H2O, 137 mg of Co(Ac)2·4H2O and 12.3 mg of Mn(Ac)2·4H2O were dissolved into 1.8 ml of 1,3-propanediol completely. It was evenly dispersed by ultrasonic treatment for 20 min. Then, 28.1 mL of isopropanol was added into the above solution to form a solution in lavender color. Next, oxygen gas was purged into the mixed solution for 5 minutes to make the solution saturated with oxygen. Then, the resulting mixture was transferred into a 50 mL Teflon-lined autoclave and kept at 160<sup>o</sup>C for 18 h. After cooling to room temperature naturally, the product was obtained by centrifugation, washed with water and alcohol at 3 times and finally dried at 60<sup>o</sup>C. And other NixCo2x-yMny-LDH materials with different compositions were synthesized by changing the relative proportion of transition metal acetate.

#### **Materials characterization**

Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained on an X-ray diffracometer (Bruker D8, Bruker, Germany) with Cu Kα radiation in the range of 10<sup>o</sup> -80<sup>o</sup> . X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed with a Thermo fisher Scientific K-Alpha. Thermo Gravimetric (TG) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements were performed simultaneously on a Linseis synchronous thermal analysis STA Platinum STAPT100. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images, energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectra and were observed using a Helios G4 CX. Zeiss Auriga FESEM. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were determined with a JEM-2100F transmission electron microscope JEOL JEM 2100.

#### **Electrochemical measurements**

The Faraday efficiency test was carried out on the Autolab 302N electrochemical workstation. All other electrochemical measurements were performed on a CH Instruments model 660E electrochemical workstation. A typical three-electrode system was employed using the samples as the working electrode, Hg/HgO electrode (1M KOH) as the reference electrode and graphite rods electrode as the counter electrode. 5 mg of NiCo-LDH based catalyst and 1 mg Super P were dispersed in 1 mL of 0.5 wt% Nafion solution. For comparison, Super P ink (6 mg mL-1 ) and RuO<sup>2</sup> ink (6 mg mL-1 ) were prepared, respectively. The suspension was dispersed evenly by ultrasonic treatment for 60 min. To prepare the working electrode, 10 μL of homogeneous ink was dropped on the glassy carbon electrode (GCE). Afterward, the electrode was dried naturally. The catalyst-supported NF used in the durability test at high-current density has the same catalyst loading per unit area as the GCE. Electrochemical tests were performed in 1 M KOH solution. CV activation is performed for 100 cycles in the voltage range of 1.4 V-1.6 V at a sweep rate of 10 mV s -1 . Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves were tested at a sweep rate of 5 mV s-1 . Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was measured at 1.478 V in a frequency ranges from 0.01 Hz to 100 kHz. A PINE electrode (AFE7R9G) was used for The RRDE tests. Ni6Co11Mn-LDH catalyst was loaded on the disk of the RRDE, to generate O<sup>2</sup> via OER at a constant current of 500 μA. The O<sup>2</sup> generating from the disk were collected by the ring, which was running at a constant voltage of 0.4 V *vs* RHE. The Faradaic efficiency was calculated by the following equation [44, 45] .

$$FE = \frac{I_{\text{ring}}}{N \times I_{\text{disk}}}$$
 (1)

where *I*ring is the collection current on the ring electrode at a constant potential of 0.4 V, and *I*disk is the given current on the disk electrode, *N* is the collection efficiency (specified to be 37% for a PINE electrode of model AFE7R9G). In this study, all potentials are referred to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE).

The manganese-doped NiCo-based LDH is used as an efficient catalyst for oxygen evolution reaction, which show an overpotential of 248 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm-2 and a small Tafel slope of 72.2 mV dec-1 . In addition, it can operate stably for 22 hours at a current density of 100 mA cm-2 , which shows a potential practical application. The improved performance is ascribed to the transition of Ni2+ to Ni3+ due to Mn doping.

**Abstract:** Although RuO2-based electrocatalysts have been widely studied for acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), triggering the conventional adsorbate evolution mechanism to suppress kinetically favorable lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM) pathway at the expense of activity is the state-of-the-art strategy. To date, approaches to simultaneously achieve remarkable activity and stability of RuO2-based electrocatalysts through the kinetically favorable LOM pathway toward acidic OER are still elusive. Herein, we report that RuS0.45O*<sup>x</sup>* catalyst with the synergetic regulation of asymmetric S–Ru–O microstructure and Ru–SO4 local environments can simultaneously boost the lattice-oxygen-mediated OER activity and stability under acidic electrolyte. Experimental results, including *operando* attenuated total reflectance surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy, *operando* X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and theoretical studies, indicate the dynamic evolution of interfacial water structure from hydrogen-bond water to free-H2O on the surface of RuS0.45O*x*. The generated continuous free-H2O-enriched local environment is in favor of accelerating the sluggish kinetics of interfacial water dissociation and facilitating the replenishment of lattice oxygen vacancies generated during the lattice-oxygen-mediated OER process, thereby significantly enhancing the stability. Consequently, the obtained RuS0.45O*<sup>x</sup>* displays remarkable acidic OER performance with 160 mV to reach 10 mA cm−2, and robust stability with negligible activity decay over 500 h at 100 mA cm−2.

## *Introduction*

Green hydrogen generation through proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer (PEMWE) is widely acknowledged as a promising approach owing to its high purity, high current density, high operating pressure, and high compatibility with renewable energy.[\[1–4\]](#page-7-0) Unfortunately, the sluggish kinetics of the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and reliance on scarce Ir-based materials (IrO2) severely impede its widespread application.[\[5–8\]](#page-7-0) With the research progressing over the past decades, ruthenium dioxide (RuO2) has been regarded as a promising alternative to IrO2 toward OER in acidic electrolyte owing to its lower cost and higher intrinsic activity through the kinetically favorable lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM) pathway.[\[9–14\]](#page-7-0) However, the activated lattice oxygen atoms participating in molecular oxygen production will lead to the formation of numerous oxygen vacancies,

which is the very reason for the collapse of crystal structure and unsatisfied long-term stability.[\[15,16\]](#page-7-0) Accordingly, under acidic conditions, suppressing the LOM pathway at the expense of activity to promote the stability of RuO2-based electrocatalysts is currently the most common solution.[\[17–19\]](#page-7-0) Therefore, rational design of efficient and stable RuO2-based electrocatalysts toward acidic OER through the kinetically favorable LOM pathway is highly desirable for the practical application of PEMWE but still remains challenging.

Generally, the oxygen vacancies are generated during the lattice-oxygen-mediated OER from the oxidation of lattice oxygen to molecular oxygen.[\[12,20,21\]](#page-7-0) Therefore, the dynamic consumption and replenishment of oxygen in and out of the lattice of RuO2 are essential for the long-term stability during the OER process.[\[22–24\]](#page-7-0) The participation of oxygen from adsorbed hydroxyl species or water molecules on the surface of RuO2 during the OER process, rather than the lattice oxygen, would significantly prevent the dissolution of active Ru species and promote stability.[\[25\]](#page-7-0) However, unlike the alkaline OER process with an abundance of hydroxyl species in the electrolyte, acidic OER encounters sluggish kinetics due to the elevated energy barrier for water molecule dissociation, resulting in relatively slow kinetics of the replenishment of oxygen into the lattice of RuO2. [\[26–28\]](#page-8-0) Recent works have highlighted the critical role of hydrogen-bond network in the electric double layer (EDL) and its impact on the dissociation of interfacial water molecules during hydrogen evolution reaction.[\[29–32\]](#page-8-0) Consequently, regulating the interfacial water structure and the connectivity of the hydrogen-bond network in the EDL to realize the continuous supply of the available reactants and the rapid replenishment of generated lattice oxygen vacancies are expected to improve the long-term

stability of RuO2 toward acidic OER.[\[33\]](#page-8-0) Unfortunately, the role of dynamic interfacial water molecules in the EDL region on OER activity is largely overlooked.

Herein, we reported the synthesis of the RuS0.45O*<sup>x</sup>* catalyst with partial substitution of O atoms in RuO2 with S atoms to form a S–Ru–O local environment and surface sulfate functionalization to form a unique Ru–SO4 microstructure. Experimental results, including electrochemical measurements, *operando* attenuated total reflectance surfaceenhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR-SEIRAS), and *operando* 18O-labeled differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS), reveal the participation of lattice oxygen in RuS0.45O*<sup>x</sup>* toward acidic OER. *Operando* X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), *operando* ATR-SEIRAS, and theoretical calculations indicate that the synergistic interaction between Ru–SO4 and S–Ru–O local environments can be in favor of stabilizing the Ru active center and regulating the interfacial water structure to reconstruct the hydrogenbond network. Such an optimized EDL structure renders a continuous free-H2O-enriched local environment close to the RuS0.45O*<sup>x</sup>* surface, resulting in accelerated kinetics of water dissociation, promoted replenishment of lattice oxygen vacancies, and enhanced activity and stability. As a result, the obtained RuS0.45O*<sup>x</sup>* exhibits an ultralow overpotential of about 160 mV to reach the current density of 10 mA cm−<sup>2</sup> and an outstanding catalytic stability of 500 h at 100 mA cm−<sup>2</sup> in 0.5 M H2SO4. Besides, the PEMWE with RuS0.45O*<sup>x</sup>* as the anode catalyst demonstrates a high current density of 4 A cm−<sup>2</sup> at 2.0 V. This work demonstrates the critical role of the interfacial water structure regulation in the LOM pathway to achieve high performance of Ru-based catalysts.

## *Results and Discussion*

The RuS0.45O*<sup>x</sup>* catalyst with S atom substituted the position of lattice oxygen, and SO4 <sup>2</sup>−-modified surface was prepared by a simple method (Figure S1 and details in the Supporting Information). RuO2 catalyst was also synthesized by a similar protocol without the addition of S powder. The specific contents of Ru and S were determined by the inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) tests (Table S1). As shown in Figure S2, the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of RuS0.45O*<sup>x</sup>* and RuO2 match well with the standard rutile RuO2 (PDF#88-0826).[\[34\]](#page-8-0) The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image shown in Figure S3 indicates that RuO2 nanoparticles are uniformly dispersed, with an average particle size of 7.44 nm. Aberrationcorrected high-angle annular darkfield scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) analysis shows that the RuS0.45O*<sup>x</sup>* catalyst is composed of ultra-small nanoparticles with an average size of about 1.74 nm (Figures [1a](#page-2-0) and S4). In addition, the distinct atomic arrangement and the corresponding fast Fourier transform (FT) pattern of RuS0.45O*<sup>x</sup>* show the crystal lattice with an interplanar spacing of 0.318 nm, which can be indexed to the (110) crystal plane of RuO2 (Figure [1b\)](#page-2-0).[\[35\]](#page-8-0) Furthermore, the HAADF-STEM image and corresponding energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) element mapping images display that the elemental distributions of Ru, S, and O are remarkably consistent (Figure [1c\)](#page-2-0). To probe the surface chemical states and explore the existence form of S element in RuS0.45O*<sup>x</sup>* catalyst, XPS characterization was adopted. As depicted in Figure [1d,](#page-2-0) the high resolution XPS spectra of Ru 3*p* in RuS0.45O*<sup>x</sup>* and RuO2 reveal that the binding energy of the main peak in RuS0.45O*<sup>x</sup>* (462.3 eV) is about 0.3 eV lower than that in RuO2 (462.6 eV), implying the electrons transfer from S species to Ru sites. The increase of Ru electron density is in favor of retarding overoxidation of Ru active species during the acidic OER process.[\[36\]](#page-8-0) Besides, the S 2*p* high-resolution XPS spectrum displays that the S element in RuS0.45O*<sup>x</sup>* is in the form of SO4 <sup>2</sup><sup>−</sup> and S<sup>2</sup><sup>−</sup> (Figure [1e\)](#page-2-0).[\[37–39\]](#page-8-0) Therefore, it can be deduced that partial S atoms substitute the lattice oxygen, and the others are in the form of SO4 <sup>2</sup><sup>−</sup> to modify the catalyst surface in RuS0.45O*x*.

To further investigate the electronic structure and coordination environment of the Ru active center, X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) was performed. Ru foil and RuO2 were used as the references for comparison. X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) is sensitive to the structure changes, in which the near-edge absorption energy is associated with the valence state and the white-line peak intensity is associated with the coordination structure. As shown in the Ru *K*-edge XANES spectra (Figure [1f\)](#page-2-0), the near-edge absorption energy of RuS0.45O*<sup>x</sup>* falls between Ru foil and RuO2, indicating the decreased valence state of Ru in RuS0.45O*x*. [\[34\]](#page-8-0) Besides, the white-line peak intensity of RuS0.45O*<sup>x</sup>* is lower than that of RuO2, suggesting the existence of structural defects in the RuS0.45O*<sup>x</sup>* structure,[\[40\]](#page-8-0) which is in favor of generating more active sites to enhance the electrocatalytic activity. In addition, the FT extended Xray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra of Ru foil, RuO2, and RuS0.45O*<sup>x</sup>* are presented in Figure [1g](#page-2-0) to elucidate the coordination environment of Ru center. The radical distance at 2.35 A in Ru foil and 1.46 ˚ A in RuO ˚ <sup>2</sup> can be assigned to the Ru–Ru and Ru–O coordination environment, respectively. RuS0.45O*<sup>x</sup>* shows the typical characteristics for Ru–O coordination structure. In addition, another signal at 2.00 A corresponding to the Ru-S coordination environment ˚ can be observed.[\[38,41\]](#page-8-0) The intervention of S can lead to the crystal structural asymmetricity and directly interact with the Ru site to affect lattice oxygen activity. Combined with the EXAFS fitting results (Figure S5), the quantitative coordination numbers and interatomic distances of different scattering paths can be obtained (Table S2). Furthermore, the wavelet transforms (WT) intuitively exhibit that the coordination environment of Ru in RuS0.45O*<sup>x</sup>* is similar to RuO2, but with a distinct Ru–S coordination located at 2.00 A (Figures ˚ [1h,i\)](#page-2-0).

The electrochemical performances of RuS0.45O*<sup>x</sup>* and RuO2 were evaluated on a standard three-electrode system in 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte. Commercial RuO2 (Com. RuO2) as a benchmark catalyst was also tested under the same conditions for reference. The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves of RuS0.45O*x*, RuO2, and Com. RuO2 were recorded with a scan rate of 5 mV s−1, as shown in Figure [2a.](#page-3-0) The overpotentials of RuS0.45O*x*, RuO2, and Com. RuO2 to reach a current density of 10 mA cm−<sup>2</sup> are 160, 235, and

287 mV, respectively. Even at high current density of 50 mA cm−2, only 190 mV is required for RuS0.45O*x*, much lower than that for RuO2 (322 mV), indicating the significantly increased activity toward acidic OER. In addition, as shown in Figure [2b,](#page-3-0) the Tafel slopes of RuS0.45O*x*, RuO2, and Com. RuO2 are calculated to be 39.18, 90.39, and 124.98 mV dec−1, respectively. As depicted in Figures [2c](#page-3-0) and S6, the electrochemical double-layer capacitance (*C*dl) value of RuS0.45O*<sup>x</sup>* is 105.68 mF cm−2, much higher than that of RuO2 catalyst (9.26 mF cm−2), suggesting the enhanced electrochemical surface area (ECSA). The specific activity normalized by ECSA of RuS0.45O*<sup>x</sup>* and RuO2 was further investigated. As shown in Figure S7, the specific activity normalized by ECSA of RuS0.45O*<sup>x</sup>* is still much higher than that of RuO2, indicating the increased intrinsic activity. *Operando* electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was measured to reveal the charge transfer rates of RuS0.45O*<sup>x</sup>* and RuO2 catalysts. As exhibited in Figures S8 and S9, RuS0.45O*<sup>x</sup>* possesses a much lower charge transfer resistance during the acidic OER process, suggesting the promoted electrons transport.[\[42\]](#page-8-0) Moreover, relevant to the Bode phase plots of RuS0.45O*<sup>x</sup>* and RuO2 at different potentials (Figure S10), it is obvious that the phase angles of RuS0.45O*<sup>x</sup>* are parallel to RuO2 at the high-frequency region but inferior to RuO2 at the low-frequency region, suggesting the reduced interfacial resistances between RuS0.45O*<sup>x</sup>* and electrolyte.[\[43,44\]](#page-8-0) Besides,

as depicted in Figure S11, the reduction of peak phase angle from 1.35 to 1.40 V for  $RuS_{0.45}O_x$  is greater than that of RuO<sub>2</sub> (1.40 to 1.45 V), reflecting the earlier onset of the acidic OER.[45] Apart from the activity, stability is also investigated. Operando XRD tests were performed to recognize the evolution of catalyst structure under different applied potentials. As demonstrated in Figures \$12 and \$13, the ratios of the peak intensity under different applied potentials to the peak intensity at open circuit potential (OCP) of the diffraction peak of the (101) plane significantly decreased with the increase of applied potential for RuO2, suggesting the instability of crystal structure during the acidic OER process. For  $RuS_{0.45}O_x$ , the crystal structure can maintain well with the increase of applied potential, revealing the obviously enhanced stability. The chronopotentiometry test at the current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> was conducted.

As shown in Figure 2d, the  $RuS_{0.45}O_x$  can operate stably up to 1000 h, while performance degradation occurs rapidly on  $RuO_2$  after several hours. The dissolved Ru concentration in  $RuS_{0.45}O_x$  after the stability test was found to be 1.60 ppm. The stability of  $RuS_{0.45}O_x$  catalyst at high current density was also explored. As depicted in Figure 2e, the  $RuS_{0.45}O_x$  catalyst can also stably catalyze the acidic OER up to 500 h at 100 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, and the dissolved Ru concentration after the stability test was found to be 4.18 ppm.

In this regard, corresponding structural characterizations of obtained catalysts after the stability tests for 10 h were carried out. As shown in Figures S14 and S15, the morphology and crystal structure of  $RuS_{0.45}O_x$  catalyst are maintained well. In addition, the surface chemical states of  $RuS_{0.45}O_x$  and  $RuO_2$  before and after the stability test were investigated. As shown in Figure S16, for pristine  $RuO_2$ , the valence state

of Ru increased significantly about 0.6 eV after the stability test, while for RuS0.45O*<sup>x</sup>* after the stability test (a-RuS0.45O*x*), the valence state of Ru only shows a certain increase of about 0.2 eV compared with RuS0.45O*<sup>x</sup>* (Figure S17). It should be noticed that the oxidation state of Ru in a-RuS0.45O*<sup>x</sup>* catalyst is still lower than that in RuO2 catalyst, suggesting the overoxidation of metal sites is significantly inhibited. In addition, the S–Ru–O and Ru–SO4 local environments in a-RuS0.45O*<sup>x</sup>* also maintain well, as shown in the S 2*p* XPS spectrum of a-RuS0.45O*<sup>x</sup>* (Figure S18).

Furthermore, through comparative analysis, the attained acidic OER activity of RuS0.45O*<sup>x</sup>* prevails over the recently reported high-performance OER catalysts (Figure [2f](#page-3-0) and Table S3). The practical application ability of RuS0.45O*<sup>x</sup>* was also evaluated through a PEMWE device. The membrane electrode assembly (MEA) was prepared by utilizing RuS0.45O*<sup>x</sup>* and commercial Pt/C as the anode and cathode catalysts, respectively. As demonstrated in Figure S19, the PEMWE cell with RuS0.45O*<sup>x</sup>* exhibits outstanding performance. Specifically, the cell voltages required for the prepared RuS0.45O*<sup>x</sup>* || Pt/C MEA at 80 °C are 1.55 V to achieve 1 A cm−2, 1.71 V to achieve 2 A cm−2, 1.85 V to achieve 3 A cm−2, and 2.00 V to achieve 4 A cm−2. Moreover, the durability evaluation of the prepared RuS0.45O*<sup>x</sup>* || Pt/C MEA was conducted at the current density of 0.1 A cm−<sup>2</sup> at 50 °C, which can hold up well for 60 000 s (Figure S20).

A series of electrochemical experiments and *operando* spectral characterizations were performed to investigate the reaction mechanism of RuS0.45O*<sup>x</sup>* in 0.5 M H2SO4. Methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) is an effective method to probe the OH\* coverage on the surface of OER catalyst, as MOR and OER are competing reactions with the same reactive intermediates (OH\*).[\[46–48\]](#page-8-0) The faster MOR kinetics means the higher coverage of OH\* on the catalyst surface, which is in favor of accelerating the OER kinetics. As demonstrated in Figures S21 and S22, the potential ratio of *V*OER/*V*MOR for RuS0.45O*<sup>x</sup>* is higher than that of RuO2, suggesting that RuS0.45O*<sup>x</sup>* processes a higher surface coverage of OH\*, which can expedite the subsequent reaction steps, improving the OER performance. Besides, *operando* ATR-SEIRAS measurement was carried out in the range of 1000–1400 cm−<sup>1</sup> to detect the reaction intermediates generated during the acidic OER process. As indicated in Figure [3a,b,](#page-5-0) vibrational bands at wavenumber ∼1108 cm−<sup>1</sup> for RuS0.45O*<sup>x</sup>* and ∼1120 cm−<sup>1</sup> for RuO2 corresponding to the OO\* vibration can be observed, suggesting both catalysts follow the LOM pathway.[\[49,50\]](#page-8-0) Furthermore, as shown in Figure [3c,d,](#page-5-0) the OER activities of RuS0.45O*<sup>x</sup>* and RuO2 catalysts are all pH dependent and decrease with the increase of pH values. There is a linear correlation for RuS0.45O*<sup>x</sup>* and RuO2 catalysts between the overpotentials at 10 mA cm−<sup>2</sup> and the pH values (Figure [3e\)](#page-5-0), further suggesting the LOM pathway.[\[51,52\]](#page-8-0)

Additionally, tetramethylammonium cation (TMA+) can be used to track the negative OO2<sup>−</sup> species, which stems from the LOM pathway, due to the specific interaction with negative oxygenated species.[\[53–55\]](#page-8-0) Through comparing the activity difference with the presence/absence of TMA<sup>+</sup> of RuS0.45O*<sup>x</sup>* and RuO2 catalysts (Figure [3f\)](#page-5-0), it can be found that both RuS0.45O*<sup>x</sup>* and RuO2 exhibit noticeably decreased acidic OER activities with the presence of TMA+, confirming the existence of OO<sup>2</sup><sup>−</sup> species. Moreover, *operando* 18O-labeled DEMS measurements were carried out.[\[12,56\]](#page-7-0) As shown in Figure [3g,h,](#page-5-0) after labeling with the 18O isotope in RuS0.45O*<sup>x</sup>* and RuO2 catalysts, the signal of 34O2 (16O18O) can be detected. Specifically, as depicted in Figure S23, the ratio of 34O2 to 32O2 for RuS0.45O*<sup>x</sup>* is 1.09%, higher than that of RuO2 (1.03%), implying the lattice oxygen in RuS0.45O*<sup>x</sup>* can effectively participate in the acidic OER to promote catalytic activity.

*Operando* XPS measurements were performed to capture the surface chemical state changes and reveal the nature of the surface species during the acidic OER process.[\[57\]](#page-8-0) As demonstrated in Figure [4a,b,](#page-6-0) the Ru 3*p* XPS spectra of RuS0.45O*<sup>x</sup>* under different applied potentials display negligible changes, differing from that of RuO2, which shows obvious overoxidation with the increase of applied potential. This suggests the stabilization of Ru active sites in RuS0.45O*<sup>x</sup>* under the adjustment of S–Ru–O and Ru–SO4 local environments. In addition, the surface elemental compositions and the content changes of oxygen vacancies for RuS0.45O*<sup>x</sup>* and RuO2 were also explored.[\[58,59\]](#page-8-0) As depicted in Figures [4c](#page-6-0) and S24, the mass fractions of Ru and S on the surface of RuS0.45O*<sup>x</sup>* are maintained well during the whole catalytic process, and the proportion of oxygen vacancies is kept unchanged. However, the mass fraction of Ru in RuO2 is significantly decreased, and the proportion of oxygen vacancies is obviously increased with the application of potential, suggesting the continuous leaching of Ru active sites and continuous consumption of lattice oxygen during the lattice oxygen-mediated acidic OER process (Figures [4d](#page-6-0) and S25). Besides, combined with the O1*s* spectra of RuS0.45O*<sup>x</sup>* and RuO2 before and after the stability tests (Figures S26–S28), it can be found that the proportion of oxygen vacancies on the surface of RuS0.45O*<sup>x</sup>* increases 2.4% after catalyzing acidic OER for 10 h, much lower than that of RuO2 (44.4%), further demonstrating the rapid replenishment of oxygen vacancies in RuS0.45O*<sup>x</sup>* during the acidic OER process. According to the elementary reaction steps, the replenishment of oxygen into the lattice of RuO2 can be affected by the adsorbed water molecules, which is closely related to the structure of the interfacial water and hydrogen-bond network in the EDL region.[\[23\]](#page-7-0) Hence, *operando* ATR-SEIRAS measurements in the range of 2800 to 3800 cm−<sup>1</sup> were performed to explore the behaviors of interfacial water molecules. Interfacial water structures consist of 4-coordinated hydrogen-bonded water (4-HB-H2O), 2-coordinated hydrogen-bonded water (2-HB-H2O), and free-H2O, among which the free-H2O with the weakest hydrogen-bond interaction requires the lowest activation energy to break the covalent O–H bond of H2O.[\[29,31,60\]](#page-8-0) The proportions of 4-HB-H2O, 2-HB-H2O, and free-H2O under different applied potentials on the surface of RuS0.45O*<sup>x</sup>* and RuO2 catalysts were demonstrated in Figures [4e](#page-6-0) and S29–S31. The comparison of free-H2O proportions at different potentials shown in Figure [4f](#page-6-0) indicates that the proportion of free-H2O on the surface of RuS0.45O*<sup>x</sup>* is much higher than that on RuO2. Besides, with the increase of applied potential, the proportion of free-H2O on the surface for RuO2 is decreased rapidly. These results indicate that the S–Ru–O and

Ru–SO $_4$  local environments in RuS $_{0.45}$ O $_x$  are beneficial for the reconstruction of interfacial water and the connectivity of hydrogen-bond network in the EDL, thereby leading to facilitated dynamic evolution from hydrogen-bond water to free-H $_2$ O, and continuous free-H $_2$ O-enriched environment. Such a free-H $_2$ O-enriched local environment is conducive to reducing the energy barrier of interfacial water dissociation, realizing the continuous supply of the available reactants, and leading to the dynamic balance between consumption and replenishment for lattice oxygen atoms in RuS $_{0.45}$ O $_x$ .

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were also performed to investigate the underlying reason for the significantly optimized activity and stability for  $RuS_{0.45}O_x$ . The calculated models of  $RuS_{0.45}O_x$  and  $RuO_2$  are displayed in Figures S32 and S33. As shown in Figure S34, the synergistic interaction between S–Ru–O and Ru–SO<sub>4</sub> local environments regulates the electron structure of  $RuS_{0.45}O_x$ , leading to charge redistribution. Based on the analysis of the projected

density of states (PDOS) calculation (Figure \$35), the p band center of O in  $RuS_{0.45}O_x$  is upshifted, indicating the activation of lattice oxygen and an accelerated LOM reaction pathway. The d band center of  $RuS_{0.45}O_x$  is calculated to be about -3.39 eV, much closer to the Fermi level in comparison with  $RuO_2$  (-3.57 eV), suggesting the strengthened adsorption ability with reaction intermediates. The reaction pathways based on LOM of RuS<sub>0.45</sub>O<sub>x</sub> and RuO<sub>2</sub> were calculated, as shown in Figure 4g. The energy barrier of the ratedetermining step (RDS) for  $RuS_{0.45}O_x$  is much lower than that of RuO<sub>2</sub>, suggesting much enhanced reaction kinetics. Besides, as shown in Figures \$36 and \$37, the energy barriers of forming OH\* and repairing lattice oxygen vacancies with the aid of interfacial water molecules on  $RuS_{0.45}O_x$  are both lower than those for RuO<sub>2</sub>. As demonstrated in Figure 4h, it can be inferred that the unique structure of S-Ru-O and Ru- $SO_4$  local environments in  $RuS_{0.45}O_x$  catalyst can regulate the electronic structure and reorganize the interfacial water 1521373, 2025. 22, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/oi/01/01002/mgg.202420848 by University Of Science, Wiley Online Library on [07/01/2026].

## *Conclusion*

In summary, we have fabricated RuS0.45O*<sup>x</sup>* with the presence of S–Ru–O local environment and Ru–SO4 modification on the surface as a highly active and stable catalyst toward acidic OER. Experimental results, including *operando* 18Olabeled DEMS, *operando* XPS measurements, *operando* ATR-SEIRAS characterizations, and DFT calculations, confirm the participation of lattice oxygen in the RuS0.45O*<sup>x</sup>* during the OER process. Moreover, the interfacial water molecules on the surface of RuS0.45O*<sup>x</sup>* undergo dynamic reconstruction from hydrogen-bond water to free-H2O, thereby leading to promoted interfacial water dissociation kinetics and optimized dynamic balance between consumption and replenishment for lattice oxygen atoms, endowing RuS0.45O*<sup>x</sup>* catalyst with outstanding activity and stability toward acidic OER. Consequently, the obtained RuS0.45O*<sup>x</sup>* exhibits an ultralow overpotential of 160 mV at 10 mA cm−<sup>2</sup> and stable operation for 500 h at 100 mA cm−<sup>2</sup> in 0.5 M H2SO4, outperforming most of the reported catalysts. This work highlights the key role of weakly hydrogen-bonded interfacial water in the activity and stability enhancement on RuO2 through the kinetically favorable lattice oxygen-mediated OER under acidic electrolyte and paves an efficient path for the design of advanced electrocatalysts with lattice oxygen-mediated electrocatalysis.
